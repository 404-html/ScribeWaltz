1
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:07.910
<v Speaker 1>And for young,</v>

2
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.490
<v Speaker 1>those were equivalent in some sense to the loss gods.</v>

3
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:11.840
<v Speaker 1>And so for young,</v>

4
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.650
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

5
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.650
<v Speaker 1>your interest was being manipulated behind the scenes by unseen forces that were</v>

6
00:00:17.811 --> 00:00:20.600
<v Speaker 1>associated with your character or logical development across time.</v>

7
00:00:20.601 --> 00:00:22.580
<v Speaker 1>That was the manifestation of the self.</v>

8
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.380
<v Speaker 1>So the self is this,</v>

9
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:25.230
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

10
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.600
<v Speaker 1>the potential you,</v>

11
00:00:26.601 --> 00:00:27.434
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

12
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.310
<v Speaker 1>and the way it operates in the present is by gripping your interest in directing</v>

13
00:00:31.311 --> 00:00:32.144
<v Speaker 1>it somewhere.</v>

14
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.820
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of the instinct of self realization.</v>

15
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:36.800
<v Speaker 1>It's a mind boggling idea,</v>

16
00:00:36.801 --> 00:00:37.041
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

17
00:00:37.041 --> 00:00:37.874
<v Speaker 1>Really it's,</v>

18
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:39.260
<v Speaker 1>I think it's correct.</v>

19
00:00:39.261 --> 00:00:39.411
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

20
00:00:39.411 --> 00:00:41.000
<v Speaker 1>I can't see how it can't be correct.</v>

21
00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:42.620
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean I understand it completely,</v>

22
00:00:42.621 --> 00:00:45.470
<v Speaker 1>but it certainly seems phenomenologically correct.</v>

23
00:00:45.471 --> 00:00:47.030
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>

24
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.710
<v Speaker 1>the potential that you are has to manifest itself somehow in the here and now.</v>

25
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:52.790
<v Speaker 1>It has to.</v>

26
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.760
<v Speaker 1>And what better way than by directing your attention,</v>

27
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:56.031
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

28
00:00:56.031 --> 00:00:56.361
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

29
00:00:56.361 --> 00:00:59.630
<v Speaker 1>it seems like this might be useful for you or maybe you get attracted to this</v>

30
00:00:59.631 --> 00:01:00.260
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

31
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.930
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you admire this person that happens with kids a lot.</v>

32
00:01:02.931 --> 00:01:04.580
<v Speaker 1>They'll admire someone and then copy them.</v>

33
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.570
<v Speaker 1>And you can see that that's obviously part of their developmental progression,</v>

34
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:09.141
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

35
00:01:09.141 --> 00:01:10.430
<v Speaker 1>It's a form of hero worship,</v>

36
00:01:10.431 --> 00:01:13.640
<v Speaker 1>but kids are very imitative and they hear a worship at the drop of a hat,</v>

37
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.230
<v Speaker 1>and so they're,</v>

38
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.630
<v Speaker 1>they're entranced by the,</v>

39
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.700
<v Speaker 1>the next stage of development.</v>

40
00:01:19.701 --> 00:01:21.530
<v Speaker 1>And if they see someone who embodies that,</v>

41
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.020
<v Speaker 1>especially if it's in the zone of proximal development,</v>

42
00:01:24.021 --> 00:01:24.191
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

43
00:01:24.191 --> 00:01:24.840
<v Speaker 1>it's some,</v>

44
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.740
<v Speaker 1>it's something they could achieve stretching a bit.</v>

45
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.070
<v Speaker 1>They find someone who embodies that next stage of development and then they</v>

46
00:01:31.071 --> 00:01:33.490
<v Speaker 1>start to imitate them and act like the,</v>

47
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.040
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

48
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.450
<v Speaker 1>we're adults are no different.</v>

49
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:36.381
<v Speaker 1>We're no different.</v>

50
00:01:36.381 --> 00:01:37.160
<v Speaker 1>We're just,</v>

51
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.310
<v Speaker 1>we do it at a perhaps more abstracted,</v>

52
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.490
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated level.</v>
