1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.550
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's part of the reason why human beings can be so infinitely</v>

2
00:00:03.551 --> 00:00:04.151
<v Speaker 1>creative,</v>

3
00:00:04.151 --> 00:00:04.391
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4
00:00:04.391 --> 00:00:04.751
<v Speaker 1>For us,</v>

5
00:00:04.751 --> 00:00:05.830
<v Speaker 1>the world isn't fixed.</v>

6
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:07.870
<v Speaker 1>We never know what it's going to bring forth.</v>

7
00:00:07.871 --> 00:00:09.400
<v Speaker 1>So 100 years ago,</v>

8
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:10.630
<v Speaker 1>if someone would have said,</v>

9
00:00:10.631 --> 00:00:11.464
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

10
00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.680
<v Speaker 1>you could build a machine on a wafer,</v>

11
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.380
<v Speaker 1>a centimeter square out of sand,</v>

12
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.740
<v Speaker 1>and if you have enough of those machines,</v>

13
00:00:20.741 --> 00:00:22.510
<v Speaker 1>than everyone in the world can be connected.</v>

14
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.050
<v Speaker 1>And everyone in the world can have an infinite library of verbal material,</v>

15
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:26.680
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

16
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.491
<v Speaker 1>That's impossible.</v>

17
00:00:27.491 --> 00:00:28.720
<v Speaker 1>But it's not impossible.</v>

18
00:00:28.721 --> 00:00:33.721
<v Speaker 1>It turns out that Silica has those properties and we can build unbelievably</v>

19
00:00:35.621 --> 00:00:37.240
<v Speaker 1>powerful machines out of nothing.</v>

20
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.630
<v Speaker 1>And so then that kind of makes you think about just what this.</v>

21
00:00:40.631 --> 00:00:43.120
<v Speaker 1>Nothing that we're building things out of his right,</v>

22
00:00:43.121 --> 00:00:48.121
<v Speaker 1>because it seems to be able to reveal a constant array of properties.</v>

23
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.140
<v Speaker 1>Properties that are essentially unlimited and its capacity to reveal those</v>

24
00:00:53.141 --> 00:00:57.070
<v Speaker 1>properties seems to depend as much on our ability to interact with it.</v>

25
00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.090
<v Speaker 1>Whatever that is,</v>

26
00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.080
<v Speaker 1>as it does on whatever the stuff is.</v>

27
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.030
<v Speaker 1>And we know even from a strict object perception of the world that the stuff</v>

28
00:01:09.031 --> 00:01:12.690
<v Speaker 1>that things are made of is a lot more complicated than we had originally</v>

29
00:01:12.691 --> 00:01:13.111
<v Speaker 1>presumed,</v>

30
00:01:13.111 --> 00:01:17.610
<v Speaker 1>even as materialists because materialists realists,</v>

31
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.000
<v Speaker 1>there are philosophy only holds down to about the subatomic level of analysis.</v>

32
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.720
<v Speaker 1>Deterministic worldview below the subatomic level of analysis.</v>

33
00:01:27.721 --> 00:01:31.560
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing deterministic at all and the stuff that things are made of is so</v>

34
00:01:31.561 --> 00:01:32.760
<v Speaker 1>mysterious that we can't even.</v>

35
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:33.571
<v Speaker 1>We can't grasp,</v>

36
00:01:33.571 --> 00:01:34.770
<v Speaker 1>but we can't comprehend it.</v>

37
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.220
<v Speaker 1>So it turns out that rather than the story world be being dependent on the</v>

38
00:01:41.611 --> 00:01:42.241
<v Speaker 1>object world,</v>

39
00:01:42.241 --> 00:01:43.410
<v Speaker 1>it might be the other way around.</v>

40
00:01:43.411 --> 00:01:47.190
<v Speaker 1>The object world is dependent on the story world and that implies at least to</v>

41
00:01:47.191 --> 00:01:49.620
<v Speaker 1>some degree that the story world is actually more real.</v>

42
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.180
<v Speaker 1>Whatever that means.</v>

43
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.070
<v Speaker 1>And then I told you that,</v>

44
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.150
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

45
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.980
<v Speaker 1>the real problem of life isn't so much what do you do when you're around things</v>

46
00:01:58.981 --> 00:02:00.780
<v Speaker 1>that you understand?</v>

47
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.470
<v Speaker 1>The real problem of life is what do you do when you encounter something you</v>

48
00:02:04.471 --> 00:02:06.480
<v Speaker 1>can't conceptualize?</v>

49
00:02:06.481 --> 00:02:10.290
<v Speaker 1>And I think a good recent example of that was the bombing of the world trade</v>

50
00:02:10.291 --> 00:02:10.681
<v Speaker 1>towers,</v>

51
00:02:10.681 --> 00:02:14.940
<v Speaker 1>which people were compelled to watch over and over and over and over.</v>

52
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.650
<v Speaker 1>And if you ask someone,</v>

53
00:02:16.651 --> 00:02:18.150
<v Speaker 1>well what is it that you're watching?</v>

54
00:02:18.151 --> 00:02:18.901
<v Speaker 1>They would say,</v>

55
00:02:18.901 --> 00:02:19.081
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

56
00:02:19.081 --> 00:02:21.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching the world trade towers fall down,</v>

57
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.190
<v Speaker 1>but then you might say,</v>

58
00:02:23.191 --> 00:02:24.600
<v Speaker 1>well why are you watching it over and over?</v>

59
00:02:24.601 --> 00:02:25.620
<v Speaker 1>And they would say something like,</v>

60
00:02:25.621 --> 00:02:25.980
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

61
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.150
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe it.</v>

62
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.340
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe it's happening.</v>

63
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.390
<v Speaker 1>And what does that mean?</v>

64
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.440
<v Speaker 1>It means something like whatever it is that's happening here,</v>

65
00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.340
<v Speaker 1>whatever's being blown apart exceeds my ability to model.</v>

66
00:02:38.341 --> 00:02:41.880
<v Speaker 1>And as a consequence I have to expose myself to it again and again and again and</v>

67
00:02:41.881 --> 00:02:44.460
<v Speaker 1>again to try to understand what's falling,</v>

68
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.080
<v Speaker 1>what's falling exactly.</v>

69
00:02:46.081 --> 00:02:46.914
<v Speaker 1>Is it just the.</v>

70
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.230
<v Speaker 1>Is it just the Towers is at 20,000 people?</v>

71
00:02:49.231 --> 00:02:50.750
<v Speaker 1>Is that the financial system of the u?</v>

72
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.990
<v Speaker 1>S is the stability of the Western world is at the beginning of world war three</v>

73
00:02:54.991 --> 00:02:58.980
<v Speaker 1>or as the former CIA director just mentioned in the u,</v>

74
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.890
<v Speaker 1>the beginning of World War for what is it exactly that you're looking at?</v>

75
00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:04.840
<v Speaker 1>When something happens that you don't understand</v>

76
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.481
<v Speaker 1>and then you'll say,</v>

77
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:10.601
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

78
00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:11.800
<v Speaker 1>how do you react to that?</v>

79
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.430
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out that you react mostly with your body,</v>

80
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.540
<v Speaker 1>not with your mind,</v>

81
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.070
<v Speaker 1>not with your perceptual systems,</v>

82
00:03:18.071 --> 00:03:18.940
<v Speaker 1>not with your thoughts,</v>

83
00:03:18.941 --> 00:03:20.860
<v Speaker 1>but with your emotions and your body,</v>

84
00:03:20.861 --> 00:03:25.630
<v Speaker 1>and that means you sweat and you panic and you feel depressed and you feel hurt</v>

85
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.610
<v Speaker 1>and you feel ashamed and you're prepared for a catastrophe which is stress and</v>

86
00:03:30.611 --> 00:03:32.430
<v Speaker 1>all that basically noncognitive.</v>

87
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.730
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that when you encounter something you don't understand,</v>

88
00:03:36.731 --> 00:03:41.731
<v Speaker 1>the first manner in which you conceive of it is embodied emotional,</v>

89
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.540
<v Speaker 1>physical way.</v>

90
00:03:43.541 --> 00:03:47.170
<v Speaker 1>Before you develop up an object representation or cognitive representation,</v>

91
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.490
<v Speaker 1>you may not ever get it like an event like that or a worse event can throw</v>

92
00:03:51.491 --> 00:03:55.960
<v Speaker 1>someone into a tailspin that's so extreme that they never get out of it.</v>

93
00:03:55.961 --> 00:03:56.501
<v Speaker 1>So you see,</v>

94
00:03:56.501 --> 00:03:57.101
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

95
00:03:57.101 --> 00:03:57.701
<v Speaker 1>sometimes,</v>

96
00:03:57.701 --> 00:03:59.740
<v Speaker 1>and this is more true among elderly people,</v>

97
00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:01.060
<v Speaker 1>if their spouse dies,</v>

98
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.540
<v Speaker 1>the probability that they'll die in the next year,</v>

99
00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.380
<v Speaker 1>say from a heart attack or something like that,</v>

100
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.910
<v Speaker 1>increases substantially.</v>

101
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:08.290
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>

102
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.410
<v Speaker 1>It's because they're conceptual frame was so dependent on the existence of their</v>

103
00:04:15.251 --> 00:04:15.731
<v Speaker 1>spouse.</v>

104
00:04:15.731 --> 00:04:20.731
<v Speaker 1>Say someone they've lived with for 25 years that the anxiety and uncertainty</v>

105
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.980
<v Speaker 1>caused by their anomalous disappearance there death is so extreme that it sends</v>

106
00:04:26.591 --> 00:04:30.400
<v Speaker 1>their body into a physiological state that's basically unbearable and that does</v>

107
00:04:30.401 --> 00:04:31.060
<v Speaker 1>the men,</v>

108
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.060
<v Speaker 1>and when you start to understand what having your preconceptions rattled really</v>

109
00:04:36.071 --> 00:04:36.521
<v Speaker 1>means,</v>

110
00:04:36.521 --> 00:04:41.521
<v Speaker 1>then you also start to understand why people are so motivated to protect their</v>

111
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.780
<v Speaker 1>ideological territory,</v>

112
00:04:43.781 --> 00:04:44.030
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

113
00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.220
<v Speaker 1>Because ideological territory,</v>

114
00:04:45.221 --> 00:04:46.570
<v Speaker 1>that's how you see the world.</v>

115
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.600
<v Speaker 1>That's your story and you can't have your fundaments rattled all the time</v>

116
00:04:51.851 --> 00:04:55.660
<v Speaker 1>because it throws everything into chaos and that puts you in this terrible,</v>

117
00:04:55.661 --> 00:05:00.661
<v Speaker 1>panicky cortisol written stressful state that's really hard on you physically.</v>

118
00:05:01.241 --> 00:05:01.751
<v Speaker 1>So we know,</v>

119
00:05:01.751 --> 00:05:02.351
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

120
00:05:02.351 --> 00:05:05.950
<v Speaker 1>that if you're in a state where you're chronically exposed to threat or</v>

121
00:05:05.951 --> 00:05:06.491
<v Speaker 1>punishment,</v>

122
00:05:06.491 --> 00:05:07.930
<v Speaker 1>which is the case in depression,</v>

123
00:05:07.931 --> 00:05:10.090
<v Speaker 1>say you produce a lot of cortisol,</v>

124
00:05:10.091 --> 00:05:12.940
<v Speaker 1>which is a stress hormone and cortisol is toxic,</v>

125
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.270
<v Speaker 1>so the more of it you produce,</v>

126
00:05:14.271 --> 00:05:17.980
<v Speaker 1>the more you kill off your hippocampal cells and you really need them because</v>

127
00:05:17.981 --> 00:05:19.060
<v Speaker 1>they are key to memory.</v>

128
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.210
<v Speaker 1>You do in your immunological system.</v>

129
00:05:22.211 --> 00:05:25.000
<v Speaker 1>There's all sorts of negative side effects of cortisol poisoning,</v>

130
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.460
<v Speaker 1>increased incidents of cardiovascular disease,</v>

131
00:05:27.461 --> 00:05:28.690
<v Speaker 1>heightened grade IV cancer,</v>

132
00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.400
<v Speaker 1>plus it's just no fun,</v>

133
00:05:30.401 --> 00:05:30.671
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

134
00:05:30.671 --> 00:05:33.550
<v Speaker 1>It's the worst thing that can possibly happen to you essentially.</v>

135
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.180
<v Speaker 1>If something I know it happens to you in blows your frame of reference,</v>

136
00:05:37.181 --> 00:05:37.361
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

137
00:05:37.361 --> 00:05:38.440
<v Speaker 1>knocks you for a loop,</v>

138
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.730
<v Speaker 1>sends you to the underworld,</v>

139
00:05:39.731 --> 00:05:41.410
<v Speaker 1>however you want to construe it,</v>

140
00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.630
<v Speaker 1>that's really going to upset your bandwagon and throw you into a state that you</v>

141
00:05:46.631 --> 00:05:48.220
<v Speaker 1>do virtually anything to avoid.</v>

142
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:49.870
<v Speaker 1>But by the same token,</v>

143
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.290
<v Speaker 1>there is a possibility that inside that chaotic mess,</v>

144
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.090
<v Speaker 1>there's something you really need.</v>

145
00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.800
<v Speaker 1>And what's the logic there?</v>

146
00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.741
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

147
00:05:57.741 --> 00:05:59.180
<v Speaker 1>the logic is something like this.</v>

148
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:00.350
<v Speaker 1>When you look at the world,</v>

149
00:06:00.351 --> 00:06:04.070
<v Speaker 1>you only see a fragment of it and that's good because it's pretty overwhelming</v>

150
00:06:04.071 --> 00:06:06.080
<v Speaker 1>and a fragments generally more than enough,</v>

151
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.240
<v Speaker 1>but all the information that you've ever gathered in your entire life to build</v>

152
00:06:11.241 --> 00:06:15.470
<v Speaker 1>yourself out of and to make your life stable has come as a consequence of your</v>

153
00:06:15.471 --> 00:06:18.350
<v Speaker 1>ability to explore what you don't understand,</v>

154
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.050
<v Speaker 1>and that's an unlimited capacity,</v>

155
00:06:21.051 --> 00:06:21.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

156
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.030
<v Speaker 1>No matter how much you explored,</v>

157
00:06:23.031 --> 00:06:24.710
<v Speaker 1>how much information you gather,</v>

158
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.490
<v Speaker 1>there's always the possibility that there's way more information out there and</v>

159
00:06:28.491 --> 00:06:31.880
<v Speaker 1>that means if you have a problem and you see that it's a problem,</v>

160
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.230
<v Speaker 1>even though that's frightening,</v>

161
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.500
<v Speaker 1>it's also a gateway into a domain of possibility and the possibility is this</v>

162
00:06:38.511 --> 00:06:42.920
<v Speaker 1>richly informative background that could in principle provide you with any</v>

163
00:06:42.921 --> 00:06:46.640
<v Speaker 1>answer you need and then you can take one more thing.</v>

164
00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:48.500
<v Speaker 1>And the old Gods,</v>

165
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.830
<v Speaker 1>Mars say the God of war,</v>

166
00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:52.371
<v Speaker 1>Venus,</v>

167
00:06:52.371 --> 00:06:53.204
<v Speaker 1>the god of love,</v>

168
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.700
<v Speaker 1>they're all internalized for us,</v>

169
00:06:55.701 --> 00:06:56.534
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

170
00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.620
<v Speaker 1>We know that anger is the psychological state and that love is the psychological</v>

171
00:07:00.621 --> 00:07:01.454
<v Speaker 1>state,</v>

172
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:04.100
<v Speaker 1>but if we look at our great religious traditions,</v>

173
00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.040
<v Speaker 1>Christianity say or Buddhism,</v>

174
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.930
<v Speaker 1>just to take two as an example,</v>

175
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:14.000
<v Speaker 1>we still have this notion that what these figures represent is something</v>

176
00:07:14.001 --> 00:07:14.860
<v Speaker 1>external.</v>

177
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:16.041
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

178
00:07:16.041 --> 00:07:17.690
<v Speaker 1>you might say how primitive,</v>

179
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:19.423
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

180
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.420
<v Speaker 1>Just as primitive as the idea that the god of war is something external,</v>

181
00:07:23.421 --> 00:07:24.830
<v Speaker 1>is the idea that this sort of figure,</v>

182
00:07:24.831 --> 00:07:26.570
<v Speaker 1>it's supposed to be something external.</v>

183
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:29.510
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to be something embodied,</v>

184
00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:30.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

185
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:34.700
<v Speaker 1>It's a story about the nature of individual moral responsibility.</v>

186
00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.910
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is something like this,</v>

187
00:07:37.911 --> 00:07:38.744
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

188
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.880
<v Speaker 1>reality itself,</v>

189
00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:45.940
<v Speaker 1>the existence of things seems to depend on the existence of a finite observer so</v>

190
00:07:46.761 --> 00:07:48.620
<v Speaker 1>that we can see things from a perspective.</v>

191
00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:50.330
<v Speaker 1>If you don't see things from a perspective,</v>

192
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:51.530
<v Speaker 1>everything is the same.</v>

193
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:53.180
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing delineated,</v>

194
00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:56.360
<v Speaker 1>but if there's going to be delineated things,</v>

195
00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:57.620
<v Speaker 1>small things,</v>

196
00:07:57.621 --> 00:07:58.520
<v Speaker 1>insufficient things,</v>

197
00:07:58.521 --> 00:08:02.420
<v Speaker 1>and they're going to be aware they're going to be vulnerable as a part of their</v>

198
00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:03.920
<v Speaker 1>limitation.</v>

199
00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:04.701
<v Speaker 1>And so you say,</v>

200
00:08:04.701 --> 00:08:05.534
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

201
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:10.130
<v Speaker 1>limitation is a precondition for being and that means suffering is part and</v>

202
00:08:10.131 --> 00:08:11.090
<v Speaker 1>parcel of being.</v>

203
00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:16.751
<v Speaker 1>Dostoevsky.</v>

204
00:08:16.751 --> 00:08:17.584
<v Speaker 1>Said clearly,</v>

205
00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:18.423
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

206
00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:20.110
<v Speaker 1>I give you all the cake you want,</v>

207
00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:21.490
<v Speaker 1>you got a big house,</v>

208
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:22.600
<v Speaker 1>you got nothing to do,</v>

209
00:08:22.601 --> 00:08:23.770
<v Speaker 1>but watch TV,</v>

210
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:24.191
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

211
00:08:24.191 --> 00:08:25.870
<v Speaker 1>And propagate the species.</v>

212
00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:26.920
<v Speaker 1>Are you happy?</v>

213
00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:28.330
<v Speaker 1>And Dostoevsky says,</v>

214
00:08:28.331 --> 00:08:28.481
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

215
00:08:28.481 --> 00:08:28.781
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

216
00:08:28.781 --> 00:08:29.440
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

217
00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:29.651
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

218
00:08:29.651 --> 00:08:32.260
<v Speaker 1>because human beings are really fundamentally,</v>

219
00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:34.570
<v Speaker 1>you're ungrateful and insane.</v>

220
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:38.590
<v Speaker 1>So if you give them some little comfortable niche to occupy themselves with so</v>

221
00:08:38.591 --> 00:08:39.730
<v Speaker 1>they don't have anything to worry about.</v>

222
00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:41.020
<v Speaker 1>The first thing they're gonna do,</v>

223
00:08:41.021 --> 00:08:44.140
<v Speaker 1>just like Adam and eve basically are just like Gautama Buddha.</v>

224
00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:47.410
<v Speaker 1>They're going to run around looking for the apple,</v>

225
00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:48.580
<v Speaker 1>looking for the snake,</v>

226
00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.580
<v Speaker 1>looking for the trouble to smash the frame into bits,</v>

227
00:08:51.581 --> 00:08:52.900
<v Speaker 1>no matter how comfortable it is,</v>

228
00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:56.700
<v Speaker 1>just so they can get access to little and have some fun.</v>

229
00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:57.751
<v Speaker 1>And so then you think,</v>

230
00:08:57.751 --> 00:09:01.740
<v Speaker 1>well maybe it's more like the purpose of life isn't to avoid chaos because we</v>

231
00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:02.400
<v Speaker 1>like chaos.</v>

232
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.151
<v Speaker 1>It's entertaining,</v>

233
00:09:03.151 --> 00:09:03.361
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

234
00:09:03.361 --> 00:09:07.170
<v Speaker 1>It keeps us alert and awake and it gives us something to do that really has no</v>

235
00:09:07.171 --> 00:09:07.830
<v Speaker 1>end.</v>

236
00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:09.990
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe the answer is something more like,</v>

237
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:10.711
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

238
00:09:10.711 --> 00:09:12.210
<v Speaker 1>forget the frame of reference,</v>

239
00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:13.500
<v Speaker 1>forget the chaos,</v>

240
00:09:13.501 --> 00:09:16.200
<v Speaker 1>but hit the balance right between the two.</v>

241
00:09:16.201 --> 00:09:16.561
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

242
00:09:16.561 --> 00:09:20.160
<v Speaker 1>So that you've got one foot where it's reasonably comfortable and you got one</v>

243
00:09:20.161 --> 00:09:23.550
<v Speaker 1>foot out there where it's kind of exciting and dangerous and that's perfect,</v>

244
00:09:23.551 --> 00:09:28.260
<v Speaker 1>and then you think the state you want to attain that makes you resistant to even</v>

245
00:09:28.261 --> 00:09:29.550
<v Speaker 1>the greatest anomalies.</v>

246
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:30.780
<v Speaker 1>Anomalies of death,</v>

247
00:09:30.781 --> 00:09:30.991
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

248
00:09:30.991 --> 00:09:33.510
<v Speaker 1>or vulnerability or mortality is exactly.</v>

249
00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:35.520
<v Speaker 1>That's that position,</v>

250
00:09:35.521 --> 00:09:39.900
<v Speaker 1>right balance straight between the forces of chaos and the forces of order or</v>

251
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:45.080
<v Speaker 1>between Yin and Yang and how do you know you're there because that's what it</v>

252
00:09:45.211 --> 00:09:46.110
<v Speaker 1>really boils down to.</v>

253
00:09:46.111 --> 00:09:48.360
<v Speaker 1>How do you know that you're there and then you think,</v>

254
00:09:48.361 --> 00:09:48.661
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

255
00:09:48.661 --> 00:09:49.500
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty simple.</v>

256
00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:53.650
<v Speaker 1>You Watch with your eyes open,</v>

257
00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:55.460
<v Speaker 1>just like Solzhenitsyn Watch.</v>

258
00:09:55.461 --> 00:09:57.250
<v Speaker 1>Do you think I don't know everything,</v>

259
00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:58.750
<v Speaker 1>so let's see what I do.</v>

260
00:09:58.751 --> 00:09:59.410
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

261
00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:00.510
<v Speaker 1>no preconceptions.</v>

262
00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:05.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to shield myself from the truth with some second rate frame of</v>

263
00:10:05.171 --> 00:10:05.621
<v Speaker 1>reference.</v>

264
00:10:05.621 --> 00:10:08.590
<v Speaker 1>We don't believe in those anyways because they're always fragmental.</v>

265
00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:09.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to watch.</v>

266
00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:12.100
<v Speaker 1>So when am I not miserable?</v>

267
00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:12.941
<v Speaker 1>And then you think,</v>

268
00:10:12.941 --> 00:10:13.181
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

269
00:10:13.181 --> 00:10:15.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm not miserable when I'm interested in things.</v>

270
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:16.390
<v Speaker 1>Something I get interested in,</v>

271
00:10:16.391 --> 00:10:19.700
<v Speaker 1>something I don't exactly know why I get interested in it.</v>

272
00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:20.980
<v Speaker 1>It catches me.</v>

273
00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:25.873
<v Speaker 1>What are the,</v>

274
00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:28.040
<v Speaker 1>what's the phenomenology of being caught,</v>

275
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:29.600
<v Speaker 1>are not self conscious.</v>

276
00:10:29.601 --> 00:10:31.220
<v Speaker 1>When I'm engaged in something,</v>

277
00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:32.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm more like a child,</v>

278
00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:36.050
<v Speaker 1>which is why children have intimations of immortality.</v>

279
00:10:36.051 --> 00:10:38.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean engaged in this process.</v>

280
00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:39.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't think about myself,</v>

281
00:10:39.981 --> 00:10:41.600
<v Speaker 1>so I'm not self conscious.</v>

282
00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:45.440
<v Speaker 1>I lose my sense of temporality because it seems like I can do whatever it is</v>

283
00:10:45.441 --> 00:10:50.270
<v Speaker 1>that I'm doing thing that I enjoy for hours and the time flies by and I'm not</v>

284
00:10:50.271 --> 00:10:54.200
<v Speaker 1>even really aware of the surrounding world and none of my existential concerns</v>

285
00:10:54.201 --> 00:10:56.330
<v Speaker 1>are paramount at that time.</v>

286
00:10:56.690 --> 00:11:00.350
<v Speaker 1>Every need is suppressed by my engagement in the activity.</v>

287
00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:01.730
<v Speaker 1>And then you say to yourself,</v>

288
00:11:01.731 --> 00:11:01.971
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

289
00:11:01.971 --> 00:11:02.241
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

290
00:11:02.241 --> 00:11:04.020
<v Speaker 1>I find that only happens like you know,</v>

291
00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:07.670
<v Speaker 1>10 minutes every three days or something when I'm being particularly miserable.</v>

292
00:11:07.671 --> 00:11:08.630
<v Speaker 1>But you might say,</v>

293
00:11:08.631 --> 00:11:08.841
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

294
00:11:08.841 --> 00:11:11.690
<v Speaker 1>the fact that it happens at all is probably worth paying attention to.</v>

295
00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you believe that your experience is real,</v>

296
00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:15.710
<v Speaker 1>like real,</v>

297
00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:18.170
<v Speaker 1>the fact that you can get into a state like that at all,</v>

298
00:11:18.171 --> 00:11:19.310
<v Speaker 1>it's worth paying attention to.</v>

299
00:11:19.311 --> 00:11:20.150
<v Speaker 1>And so then you might say,</v>

300
00:11:20.151 --> 00:11:20.760
<v Speaker 1>well that's,</v>

301
00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:25.220
<v Speaker 1>that's where your sense of ethics really starts to arise is what makes you</v>

302
00:11:25.221 --> 00:11:25.821
<v Speaker 1>interested.</v>

303
00:11:25.821 --> 00:11:26.031
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

304
00:11:26.031 --> 00:11:27.550
<v Speaker 1>it might be just as cracked and,</v>

305
00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:28.090
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

306
00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:30.770
<v Speaker 1>and peculiar as something you could possibly imagine,</v>

307
00:11:30.771 --> 00:11:31.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

308
00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.390
<v Speaker 1>Your parents are against it,</v>

309
00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:33.440
<v Speaker 1>your friends or against it.</v>

310
00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:35.990
<v Speaker 1>Even you're against it when you're thinking clearly,</v>

311
00:11:35.991 --> 00:11:40.991
<v Speaker 1>but there's still this reality that something compels you and then you think,</v>

312
00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:41.391
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

313
00:11:41.391 --> 00:11:42.440
<v Speaker 1>can you trust it?</v>

314
00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:43.791
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

315
00:11:43.791 --> 00:11:47.660
<v Speaker 1>well that's a tough question because I read a long time for a long time,</v>

316
00:11:47.661 --> 00:11:52.250
<v Speaker 1>I read accounts of serial killers because I was really interested in what</v>

317
00:11:52.251 --> 00:11:53.084
<v Speaker 1>motivated.</v>

318
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:53.351
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

319
00:11:53.351 --> 00:11:56.050
<v Speaker 1>And they're an interesting breed in many ways,</v>

320
00:11:56.051 --> 00:11:58.540
<v Speaker 1>which is why there's such a popular fascination with them.</v>

321
00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:00.940
<v Speaker 1>And so then you think about a story like that and you think,</v>

322
00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:02.020
<v Speaker 1>Geez,</v>

323
00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:03.910
<v Speaker 1>maybe you can't trust your interest,</v>

324
00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:04.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

325
00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:05.680
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it'll take you somewhere.</v>

326
00:12:05.681 --> 00:12:06.520
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to go,</v>

327
00:12:06.521 --> 00:12:08.350
<v Speaker 1>like seriously where you don't want to go.</v>

328
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:12.490
<v Speaker 1>How do you know that if you really let yourself be who you could be,</v>

329
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:14.260
<v Speaker 1>that you'd end up somewhere good.</v>

330
00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:16.870
<v Speaker 1>And so then you come to the second part of the story,</v>

331
00:12:16.871 --> 00:12:18.070
<v Speaker 1>which is something like this.</v>

332
00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:20.560
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that you're a very,</v>

333
00:12:20.561 --> 00:12:20.951
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

334
00:12:20.951 --> 00:12:24.190
<v Speaker 1>very finely tuned biological machine,</v>

335
00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:25.323
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

336
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:28.630
<v Speaker 1>Lack into a computer and then you say,</v>

337
00:12:28.631 --> 00:12:29.410
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

338
00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:32.620
<v Speaker 1>you take a computer and you feed it false information.</v>

339
00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:33.910
<v Speaker 1>What do you get out?</v>

340
00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:36.100
<v Speaker 1>False information,</v>

341
00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:37.293
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

342
00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:37.691
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

343
00:12:37.691 --> 00:12:39.430
<v Speaker 1>you've stuck with this computer.</v>

344
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:40.900
<v Speaker 1>It's very complicated.</v>

345
00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:44.710
<v Speaker 1>You kind of reside in it in some manner you don't understand.</v>

346
00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:50.040
<v Speaker 1>And yet you're prone pawn occasions either to deny it information altogether</v>

347
00:12:50.831 --> 00:12:54.240
<v Speaker 1>when you walk away from something you know you shouldn't walk away from or to</v>

348
00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:54.550
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

349
00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:55.660
<v Speaker 1>bad information.</v>

350
00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:56.763
<v Speaker 1>And so then what if,</v>

351
00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:57.850
<v Speaker 1>what if this was the case?</v>

352
00:12:57.851 --> 00:13:02.170
<v Speaker 1>What if it was the case that the systems that Orient you with regards to your</v>

353
00:13:02.171 --> 00:13:06.940
<v Speaker 1>interest can become pathologized by any relationship you have with yourself</v>

354
00:13:06.941 --> 00:13:08.770
<v Speaker 1>that's predicated on bad faith.</v>

355
00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:10.271
<v Speaker 1>And so then you think,</v>

356
00:13:10.271 --> 00:13:11.104
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

357
00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:15.250
<v Speaker 1>that's why there's an ethical aspect to this redemptive process.</v>

358
00:13:15.251 --> 00:13:18.000
<v Speaker 1>Like a real strenuous and strict ethical aspect.</v>

359
00:13:18.001 --> 00:13:19.090
<v Speaker 1>It goes something like this.</v>

360
00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:21.100
<v Speaker 1>There are things that you can do.</v>

361
00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:25.870
<v Speaker 1>Find yourself engaged with the world at such a level that your existential</v>

362
00:13:25.871 --> 00:13:29.800
<v Speaker 1>concerns could disappear and we can even understand that biochemically to some</v>

363
00:13:29.801 --> 00:13:32.200
<v Speaker 1>degree because if you're really interested in something,</v>

364
00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:33.960
<v Speaker 1>you get a dopamine release,</v>

365
00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:35.680
<v Speaker 1>an exploratory dopamine release,</v>

366
00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:36.880
<v Speaker 1>that's great.</v>

367
00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:39.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's associated with positive effect with confidence,</v>

368
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.950
<v Speaker 1>with increased immunological functioning,</v>

369
00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:45.670
<v Speaker 1>with better memory functioning with learning everything you want.</v>

370
00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:50.350
<v Speaker 1>It's also potently antianxiety,</v>

371
00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.040
<v Speaker 1>lytic and analgesic,</v>

372
00:13:52.041 --> 00:13:55.400
<v Speaker 1>which means that if you're really pursuing something that's compelling to you,</v>

373
00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:58.400
<v Speaker 1>you're much more resistant biochemically to punishment,</v>

374
00:13:58.401 --> 00:13:59.091
<v Speaker 1>disappointment,</v>

375
00:13:59.091 --> 00:13:59.840
<v Speaker 1>depression,</v>

376
00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:00.530
<v Speaker 1>pain,</v>

377
00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:01.010
<v Speaker 1>threat,</v>

378
00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:01.640
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

379
00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.050
<v Speaker 1>and it's not because you're blind,</v>

380
00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:05.301
<v Speaker 1>you're blind.</v>

381
00:14:05.301 --> 00:14:08.690
<v Speaker 1>It's because your nervous system is optimally tuned to make you maximally</v>

382
00:14:08.691 --> 00:14:09.231
<v Speaker 1>resistant,</v>

383
00:14:09.231 --> 00:14:12.470
<v Speaker 1>and so then you might think if you were optimally tuned,</v>

384
00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.270
<v Speaker 1>how resistant would you be?</v>

385
00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:15.963
<v Speaker 1>You don't know,</v>

386
00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:16.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

387
00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:20.420
<v Speaker 1>Because it's a spiral that never stops moving uphill.</v>

388
00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:26.830
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what the upper mds and we have exemplars that might indicate what</v>

389
00:14:27.081 --> 00:14:28.370
<v Speaker 1>that upper end could be,</v>

390
00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.110
<v Speaker 1>but we don't actually know.</v>

391
00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:31.551
<v Speaker 1>So then you think,</v>

392
00:14:31.551 --> 00:14:31.881
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

393
00:14:31.881 --> 00:14:32.720
<v Speaker 1>well here's the.</v>

394
00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:35.690
<v Speaker 1>Here's the rule.</v>

395
00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.100
<v Speaker 1>Say something like this.</v>

396
00:14:37.101 --> 00:14:38.810
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the world from this perspective,</v>

397
00:14:38.811 --> 00:14:40.520
<v Speaker 1>which is something you have to decide if you're,</v>

398
00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:41.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

399
00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:43.850
<v Speaker 1>you find compelling and reasonable.</v>

400
00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:45.230
<v Speaker 1>The rule is this,</v>

401
00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:51.870
<v Speaker 1>you're always gonna run into it normally,</v>

402
00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:52.713
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

403
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:53.180
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

404
00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:53.311
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

405
00:14:53.311 --> 00:14:55.640
<v Speaker 2>normally is always going to look to look to you like,</v>

406
00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.073
<v Speaker 2>like this,</v>

407
00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:59.600
<v Speaker 2>and it's no bloody wonder.</v>

408
00:14:59.601 --> 00:15:00.770
<v Speaker 2>You want to run away from that.</v>

409
00:15:00.771 --> 00:15:04.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean in some ways is your whole body's telling you watch out and for good</v>

410
00:15:04.641 --> 00:15:05.900
<v Speaker 2>reason because it's no joke,</v>

411
00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:09.860
<v Speaker 2>but then it was more to the story because the anomalous thing,</v>

412
00:15:09.861 --> 00:15:11.450
<v Speaker 2>that's everything you don't know.</v>

413
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:13.221
<v Speaker 2>And you might say,</v>

414
00:15:13.221 --> 00:15:13.700
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

415
00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.890
<v Speaker 2>you're going out with someone and you want to have a longterm relationship.</v>

416
00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:16.753
<v Speaker 2>They'd be true.</v>

417
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:18.380
<v Speaker 2>How could there be any good in that?</v>

418
00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:23.180
<v Speaker 2>Because that's certainly what you're going to ask when you first encounter the</v>

419
00:15:23.181 --> 00:15:24.470
<v Speaker 2>unexpected information,</v>

420
00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:29.390
<v Speaker 2>but then you might think could be that I'm a little too naive for my own good,</v>

421
00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:30.320
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

422
00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:34.640
<v Speaker 2>People pull me in a little more than they should or I'm not sufficiently careful</v>

423
00:15:34.641 --> 00:15:37.880
<v Speaker 2>when I enter into intimate relationships with people or I don't treat people</v>

424
00:15:37.881 --> 00:15:42.320
<v Speaker 2>right or I don't have a good conceptualization of myself or I'm chasing after</v>

425
00:15:42.321 --> 00:15:43.154
<v Speaker 2>the wrong person.</v>

426
00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:44.361
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

427
00:15:44.361 --> 00:15:46.250
<v Speaker 2>that's all going to be very annoying to learn,</v>

428
00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:47.121
<v Speaker 2>but if you don't learn it,</v>

429
00:15:47.121 --> 00:15:48.290
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be in big trouble.</v>

430
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:51.980
<v Speaker 2>So maybe the best thing to do and enormity of that sort hits you is to think,</v>

431
00:15:51.981 --> 00:15:52.640
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

432
00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:53.270
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

433
00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:54.140
<v Speaker 2>it's a dragon.</v>

434
00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:55.850
<v Speaker 2>No doubt it will eat me,</v>

435
00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.500
<v Speaker 2>but if I don't let it eat me,</v>

436
00:15:57.501 --> 00:16:00.410
<v Speaker 2>then they'll just be another one waiting around the corner and it'll probably be</v>

437
00:16:00.411 --> 00:16:02.480
<v Speaker 2>a little bit bigger and if I get eaten by enough of them,</v>

438
00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really gonna want to be around much and maybe I'm not going to be</v>

439
00:16:05.961 --> 00:16:07.970
<v Speaker 2>willing to help other people be around much either.</v>

440
00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.730
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem like a very good alternative to me.</v>

441
00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:16.570
<v Speaker 1>Back in 1957,</v>

442
00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:21.160
<v Speaker 1>some new gnostic writings were discovered in a and a cave.</v>

443
00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:28.150
<v Speaker 1>They were discovered by these two Arab guys who went out to kill the man who</v>

444
00:16:28.151 --> 00:16:28.931
<v Speaker 1>killed her father.</v>

445
00:16:28.931 --> 00:16:30.160
<v Speaker 1>They took them out into this cave.</v>

446
00:16:30.161 --> 00:16:32.140
<v Speaker 1>Then they killed them and when they were burying them,</v>

447
00:16:32.141 --> 00:16:36.970
<v Speaker 1>they found exam for a full of papers and papyrus and they took them home and</v>

448
00:16:36.971 --> 00:16:38.410
<v Speaker 1>their mother used a bunch of them too,</v>

449
00:16:38.411 --> 00:16:42.280
<v Speaker 1>like cooking fires with and one day one of their friends who was an antiquities</v>

450
00:16:42.281 --> 00:16:44.470
<v Speaker 1>dealer showed up and he said,</v>

451
00:16:44.471 --> 00:16:44.741
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

452
00:16:44.741 --> 00:16:45.990
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't be burning those.</v>

453
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
<v Speaker 1>Those are about 1500 years old and they look like very early gnostic gospels and</v>

454
00:16:51.701 --> 00:16:54.850
<v Speaker 1>the Gnostics were this branch of Christianity that was pretty violently</v>

455
00:16:54.851 --> 00:16:59.050
<v Speaker 1>suppressed by the emergence of Orthodox Christianity and the gnostics believed</v>

456
00:16:59.051 --> 00:17:01.330
<v Speaker 1>that faith was a good thing,</v>

457
00:17:01.331 --> 00:17:02.950
<v Speaker 1>but knowledge was all right too.</v>

458
00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:08.460
<v Speaker 1>And they wrote Gospel accounts say of Christ's life that were knowledge</v>

459
00:17:09.881 --> 00:17:12.280
<v Speaker 1>predicated as much as revelation predicated.</v>

460
00:17:12.281 --> 00:17:12.491
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>

461
00:17:12.491 --> 00:17:14.800
<v Speaker 1>and this is one of the quotes from one of those Gospels,</v>

462
00:17:14.801 --> 00:17:15.820
<v Speaker 1>the Gospel of Thomas,</v>

463
00:17:15.821 --> 00:17:18.580
<v Speaker 1>which is actually one that the only one that got out,</v>

464
00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:20.680
<v Speaker 1>Carl young got ahold of them.</v>

465
00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:21.910
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly enough,</v>

466
00:17:21.911 --> 00:17:25.120
<v Speaker 1>and this is one of the quotes and I really liked this,</v>

467
00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:29.470
<v Speaker 1>this is a non canonical saying of Christ and the saying is,</v>

468
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:32.260
<v Speaker 1>if you bring forth what is within you,</v>

469
00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:35.260
<v Speaker 1>why don't you bring forth will save you.</v>

470
00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:38.500
<v Speaker 1>If you do not bring forth what is within you,</v>

471
00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:42.130
<v Speaker 1>what you do not bring forth will destroy you,</v>

472
00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:48.430
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's a pretty good line to close off the class.</v>
