1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.790
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think from the phenomenological</v>

2
00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.810
<v Speaker 1>viewpoint of your experience as a whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of you being a subject in an</v>

3
00:00:10.171 --> 00:00:12.480
<v Speaker 1>objective world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so here's another way of.</v>

4
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.930
<v Speaker 1>Here's something that's quite useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] talked about this because he</v>

5
00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:18.990
<v Speaker 1>was moving towards a phenomenological</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective later in his life.</v>

6
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.770
<v Speaker 1>The last book he wrote was called</v>
<v Speaker 1>mysterium conjunction us and he talked</v>

7
00:00:22.771 --> 00:00:27.750
<v Speaker 1>about three conjunctions that needed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take place in order for someone to be</v>

8
00:00:27.751 --> 00:00:32.010
<v Speaker 1>well constituted psychologically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know how piaget talked about</v>

9
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.260
<v Speaker 1>learning that you could not only follow</v>
<v Speaker 1>rules but that you could make rules for</v>

10
00:00:37.261 --> 00:00:39.720
<v Speaker 1>new games as sort of the highest level</v>
<v Speaker 1>of moral development.</v>

11
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.110
<v Speaker 1>I would say you extended the Piagetian</v>
<v Speaker 1>moral continuum up past what piaget had</v>

12
00:00:47.431 --> 00:00:48.630
<v Speaker 1>envisioned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he didn't.</v>

13
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.930
<v Speaker 1>He didn't do that because he wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to extend piaget's model,</v>

14
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.080
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can think about it the same way</v>

15
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.730
<v Speaker 1>and it's not easy to come up with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>moral motive being say,</v>

16
00:00:59.731 --> 00:01:02.460
<v Speaker 1>that transcends the ability to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>rules for new games.</v>

17
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.990
<v Speaker 1>That's damn smart man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

18
00:01:03.991 --> 00:01:06.870
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a major home run by piaget as far</v>

19
00:01:06.871 --> 00:01:09.450
<v Speaker 1>as I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Young said something like this said,</v>

20
00:01:09.451 --> 00:01:11.670
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're going through the process of</v>

21
00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:16.671
<v Speaker 1>psychological integration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a way of conceptualizing it,</v>

22
00:01:16.831 --> 00:01:20.820
<v Speaker 1>and he thought about this as</v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolically as male,</v>

23
00:01:20.821 --> 00:01:25.140
<v Speaker 1>female pairings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because as I've tried to point out the</v>

24
00:01:25.141 --> 00:01:26.930
<v Speaker 1>most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most fundamental character</v>

25
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.230
<v Speaker 1>categories that are mythological</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination uses to structure the world</v>

26
00:01:31.231 --> 00:01:33.060
<v Speaker 1>is the category of masculine and</v>
<v Speaker 1>feminine.</v>

27
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.860
<v Speaker 1>And it moves that around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

28
00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:36.300
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fundamental metaphor.</v>

29
00:01:36.301 --> 00:01:39.240
<v Speaker 1>So you can move that around anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so young thought,</v>

30
00:01:39.241 --> 00:01:40.710
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that you're trying to</v>

31
00:01:40.711 --> 00:01:44.670
<v Speaker 1>do is to get your thoughts and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions integrated.</v>

32
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.291
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:01:46.291 --> 00:01:49.290
<v Speaker 1>the Classic Enlightenment Viewpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

34
00:01:49.291 --> 00:01:52.530
<v Speaker 1>is something like passion is the enemy</v>
<v Speaker 1>of reason,</v>

35
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so to the degree that your rational,</v>

36
00:01:55.891 --> 00:01:57.060
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of afraid of viewpoint.</v>

37
00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.620
<v Speaker 1>It's because he got your emotions under</v>
<v Speaker 1>control and there's some truth in that,</v>

38
00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:05.070
<v Speaker 1>but not enough truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like the psg an idea better,</v>

39
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.180
<v Speaker 1>which is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

40
00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.590
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that isn't what happens.</v>

41
00:02:07.591 --> 00:02:11.550
<v Speaker 1>What happens if you're playing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>proper game is that you integrate your</v>

42
00:02:11.551 --> 00:02:14.850
<v Speaker 1>emotions underneath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're thinking something like that.</v>

43
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.040
<v Speaker 1>So they're all working in the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>direction,</v>

44
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.750
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

45
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.050
<v Speaker 1>you can make your anxiety work against</v>
<v Speaker 1>you or for you.</v>

46
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.670
<v Speaker 1>And one of the ways I get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made a program called the future</v>

47
00:02:26.671 --> 00:02:30.000
<v Speaker 1>authoring program that I think helps</v>
<v Speaker 1>people do that because one of the things</v>

48
00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:32.760
<v Speaker 1>you see when you're talking to people</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're trying to solve problems is</v>

49
00:02:32.761 --> 00:02:36.960
<v Speaker 1>that they're afraid to face the problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so then their anxiety is working</v>

50
00:02:36.961 --> 00:02:38.640
<v Speaker 1>against them and you can think about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

51
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.840
<v Speaker 1>as antagonistic to rationality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then I could say,</v>

52
00:02:42.841 --> 00:02:45.120
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't you think for awhile about</v>

53
00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.390
<v Speaker 1>what your life would be like if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't face this problem?</v>

54
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.080
<v Speaker 1>Because if you think that through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a problem and you really</v>

55
00:02:52.081 --> 00:02:56.220
<v Speaker 1>think through what the consequences are</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be in three to five years of</v>

56
00:02:56.221 --> 00:02:58.860
<v Speaker 1>not facing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to get more afraid of</v>

57
00:02:58.861 --> 00:03:02.180
<v Speaker 1>not it then facing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's great because then your</v>

58
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.570
<v Speaker 1>anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of standing in front of you,</v>

59
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.410
<v Speaker 1>instead of you having a dragon guarding</v>
<v Speaker 1>the path in front of you,</v>

60
00:03:08.411 --> 00:03:11.350
<v Speaker 1>will you have one chasing you down the</v>
<v Speaker 1>path from behind?</v>

61
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.010
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot more useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>

62
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.140
<v Speaker 1>that's just a minimal example of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>utility of getting your emotions and</v>

63
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:22.960
<v Speaker 1>your and your thoughts aligned the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

64
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.020
<v Speaker 1>The same thing happens with aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

65
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.440
<v Speaker 1>one of the most common reasons that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people come and seek psychotherapy</v>

66
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.250
<v Speaker 1>really is because they're too agreeable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what that means is they're not</v>

67
00:03:33.251 --> 00:03:35.470
<v Speaker 1>assertive enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They haven't integrated their capacity</v>

68
00:03:35.471 --> 00:03:38.400
<v Speaker 1>for aggression and so other people can</v>
<v Speaker 1>push them around and,</v>

69
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.700
<v Speaker 1>and there are very conflict avoidant and</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the consequences of that across</v>

70
00:03:44.261 --> 00:03:48.610
<v Speaker 1>time is that you don't stand up for</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself well enough and you get taken</v>

71
00:03:48.611 --> 00:03:51.520
<v Speaker 1>advantage of and that spirals badly</v>
<v Speaker 1>downward.</v>

72
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.520
<v Speaker 1>And so partly what you do when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing assertiveness training with people</v>

73
00:03:57.221 --> 00:04:01.360
<v Speaker 1>is you find out what they're angry about</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there are usually angry,</v>

74
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.210
<v Speaker 1>angry if they're not assertive enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>because other people are taking</v>

75
00:04:04.211 --> 00:04:07.000
<v Speaker 1>advantage of them or you could say</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're not putting their own</v>

76
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.680
<v Speaker 1>necessities forward with enough force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to distinguish between those</v>

77
00:04:11.681 --> 00:04:13.540
<v Speaker 1>two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

78
00:04:13.541 --> 00:04:16.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get them to talk about what they're</v>

79
00:04:16.451 --> 00:04:20.020
<v Speaker 1>angry about that often makes them cry</v>
<v Speaker 1>often many times.</v>

80
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.530
<v Speaker 1>And then you get them to kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>envision what they would want to have</v>

81
00:04:23.531 --> 00:04:26.290
<v Speaker 1>instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they're often afraid to do because</v>

82
00:04:26.291 --> 00:04:30.550
<v Speaker 1>people are afraid to think about what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want because that makes it more</v>

83
00:04:30.551 --> 00:04:33.160
<v Speaker 1>clear when they're not getting it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's painful,</v>

84
00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:35.140
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe they're afraid of hoping so</v>

85
00:04:35.141 --> 00:04:37.600
<v Speaker 1>they won't specify a clear aim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

86
00:04:37.601 --> 00:04:39.850
<v Speaker 1>you get them to think about what they</v>
<v Speaker 1>might want.</v>

87
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.570
<v Speaker 1>Instead you get them to think about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>costs of not pursuing that.</v>

88
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.860
<v Speaker 1>And then you help them develop</v>
<v Speaker 1>strategies for integrating their</v>

89
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.810
<v Speaker 1>aggression and with their thinking so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they can come up with a plan to</v>

90
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.330
<v Speaker 1>approach the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a more confident way,</v>

91
00:04:55.331 --> 00:04:57.250
<v Speaker 1>so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone might come to me and say,</v>

92
00:04:57.251 --> 00:05:00.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm being bullied badly at work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so then I'll say,</v>

93
00:05:00.611 --> 00:05:02.110
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are your options?</v>

94
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.840
<v Speaker 1>You have to put up with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

95
00:05:04.841 --> 00:05:06.430
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll figure that out because maybe you</v>

96
00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:07.720
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you don't have options,</v>

97
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.740
<v Speaker 1>but here's how to find out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get your damn cv together so it's</v>

98
00:05:11.741 --> 00:05:13.090
<v Speaker 1>pristine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

99
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.500
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's ready to go.</v>

100
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.370
<v Speaker 1>Get over your fear of a new interview</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it people are generally afraid</v>

101
00:05:18.371 --> 00:05:20.680
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get over your fear of applying for a new</v>

102
00:05:20.681 --> 00:05:22.660
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Start thinking about what it would mean</v>

103
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:23.980
<v Speaker 1>to have a different job.</v>

104
00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.630
<v Speaker 1>Start thinking about what it would mean</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have a better job even because maybe</v>

105
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.870
<v Speaker 1>your fear is just making you stuck here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can tell you one thing.</v>

106
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.900
<v Speaker 1>If someone's picking on you at work and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have options,</v>

107
00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.190
<v Speaker 1>you lose so you get the person to start</v>
<v Speaker 1>building a strategy.</v>

108
00:05:39.191 --> 00:05:40.024
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

109
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.670
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to tell this person to</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop,</v>

110
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.540
<v Speaker 1>you have to know how to make them stop</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one and the one thing you need for</v>

111
00:05:46.541 --> 00:05:48.910
<v Speaker 1>sure is an option.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you can't,</v>

112
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.540
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have an option,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then maybe we start thinking about the</v>

113
00:05:52.541 --> 00:05:56.230
<v Speaker 1>fact that you need some more training or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that because you cannot</v>

114
00:05:56.231 --> 00:05:59.980
<v Speaker 1>negotiate if you don't have any power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because while,</v>

115
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.040
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's really out to get you or</v>

116
00:06:03.041 --> 00:06:05.810
<v Speaker 1>really disagreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have a leg to stand on,</v>

117
00:06:05.811 --> 00:06:08.630
<v Speaker 1>they'll just push you over and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll jump on youtube because that's</v>

118
00:06:08.631 --> 00:06:10.120
<v Speaker 1>what they're like and they enjoy it</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>

119
00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:15.120
<v Speaker 1>So it's no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you put your options behind you and</v>

120
00:06:15.261 --> 00:06:17.720
<v Speaker 1>then you start to think about strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I tell people,</v>

121
00:06:17.721 --> 00:06:20.180
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're being harassed at work,</v>

122
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.750
<v Speaker 1>you documented every time it happens and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you write it down so you've got like 20</v>

123
00:06:23.751 --> 00:06:27.830
<v Speaker 1>stories about it and it's fully</v>
<v Speaker 1>documented and then you go confront the</v>

124
00:06:27.831 --> 00:06:30.380
<v Speaker 1>person at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with at least three pieces of</v>

125
00:06:30.381 --> 00:06:34.700
<v Speaker 1>evidence and you have some sense of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tell them about what will happen if</v>

126
00:06:34.701 --> 00:06:37.280
<v Speaker 1>they don't stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to figure out,</v>

127
00:06:37.281 --> 00:06:38.810
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they don't stop,</v>

128
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:41.240
<v Speaker 1>what are you gonna do about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leave.</v>

129
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.770
<v Speaker 1>Not if you can't leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

130
00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.720
<v Speaker 1>you have to be able to wield a big stick</v>
<v Speaker 1>and speak softly,</v>

131
00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.400
<v Speaker 1>but you see that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

132
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:53.900
<v Speaker 1>That's how you take your aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an absolutely necessary part of</v>

133
00:06:53.901 --> 00:06:58.901
<v Speaker 1>your psyche and manifest it up into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated means of dealing with the</v>

134
00:06:59.451 --> 00:06:59.960
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

135
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.220
<v Speaker 1>You don't just suppress it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

136
00:07:01.221 --> 00:07:02.750
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should be able to put up with it,</v>

137
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.090
<v Speaker 1>or I wish I wasn't so angry or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

138
00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:06.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget that.</v>

139
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.520
<v Speaker 1>That's all that'll happen is your blood</v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure will stay high and you'll die</v>

140
00:07:10.521 --> 00:07:12.350
<v Speaker 1>of a heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because anger for example,</v>

141
00:07:12.351 --> 00:07:16.220
<v Speaker 1>is a very toxic emotion and it does</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause heart damage over time.</v>

142
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:19.670
<v Speaker 1>It's the only emotion that we really</v>
<v Speaker 1>know that's been linked to things like</v>

143
00:07:19.671 --> 00:07:24.671
<v Speaker 1>cardiovascular risk and anger is is</v>
<v Speaker 1>toxic because it's like you're driving a</v>

144
00:07:25.041 --> 00:07:25.510
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've.</v>

145
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:28.340
<v Speaker 1>You're stepping on the gas and pushing</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the brake at the same time because</v>

146
00:07:28.341 --> 00:07:32.690
<v Speaker 1>anger tells you to run away and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>attack at the same time because you</v>

147
00:07:32.691 --> 00:07:34.510
<v Speaker 1>don't know what's gonna happen and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

148
00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:38.810
<v Speaker 1>It really amps up the physiological</v>
<v Speaker 1>demand on your body.</v>

149
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:42.230
<v Speaker 1>And so if you are including your heart</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your musculature,</v>

150
00:07:42.231 --> 00:07:44.390
<v Speaker 1>so if you stay like that for like 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

151
00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:49.250
<v Speaker 1>you know you're going to age 20 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a bad plan.</v>
