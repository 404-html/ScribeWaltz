1
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it all started in 2007 when I was lucky</v>

2
00:00:10.261 --> 00:00:13.200
<v Speaker 1>enough to have a full on medical level</v>
<v Speaker 1>of depression.</v>

3
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really bad.</v>

4
00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:17.550
<v Speaker 1>I talk about it in some sort of detail</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

5
00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:19.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the book I realized it's actually a</v>

6
00:00:19.411 --> 00:00:22.320
<v Speaker 1>level of which I don't even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I realized I wrote about it with details</v>

7
00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:23.490
<v Speaker 1>of my youth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My wife doesn't know.</v>

8
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.180
<v Speaker 1>There's a weird privacy thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes happens when you're talking to</v>

9
00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.470
<v Speaker 1>know dictating into a computer that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of like this just between me and</v>

10
00:00:31.471 --> 00:00:33.870
<v Speaker 1>the computer and now I realize it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably the most public thing,</v>

11
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.370
<v Speaker 1>but the thing that saved me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that ultimately helped me deal</v>

12
00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:41.190
<v Speaker 1>with my depression in general was</v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive behavioral therapy.</v>

13
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a sense,</v>

14
00:00:42.361 --> 00:00:47.361
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of like applied stoicism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just look at your own thoughts back</v>

15
00:00:47.681 --> 00:00:51.370
<v Speaker 1>to the really exaggerate once you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>labeled them as cognitive distortions</v>

16
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.960
<v Speaker 1>that these include things like</v>
<v Speaker 1>generalization,</v>

17
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.310
<v Speaker 1>catastrophizing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>binary thinking,</v>

18
00:00:57.311 --> 00:00:58.450
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything has to be there,</v>

19
00:00:58.451 --> 00:00:59.380
<v Speaker 1>all good or all bad.</v>

20
00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually particularly guilty of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these.</v>

21
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Amazingly,</v>

22
00:01:02.401 --> 00:01:06.780
<v Speaker 1>if you just actually learn what these</v>
<v Speaker 1>distortions are and practice every day</v>

23
00:01:06.781 --> 00:01:10.190
<v Speaker 1>to sort of talk back to sort of the more</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxious or depressed voices in your own</v>

24
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.450
<v Speaker 1>head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an incredibly effective treatment</v>

25
00:01:12.451 --> 00:01:14.070
<v Speaker 1>for depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety and it changed,</v>

26
00:01:14.071 --> 00:01:16.220
<v Speaker 1>absolutely changed my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

27
00:01:16.221 --> 00:01:18.860
<v Speaker 1>as this is changing my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still work.</v>

28
00:01:18.861 --> 00:01:23.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm still the president of fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means I defend free speech and due</v>

29
00:01:23.061 --> 00:01:26.110
<v Speaker 1>process and academic freedom on campus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

30
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.850
<v Speaker 1>and while I was learning all of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual habits,</v>

31
00:01:30.851 --> 00:01:32.590
<v Speaker 1>all these ways to sort of talk yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>

32
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.810
<v Speaker 1>I was looking around at what</v>
<v Speaker 1>administrators were doing and saying to</v>

33
00:01:36.811 --> 00:01:37.441
<v Speaker 1>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

34
00:01:37.441 --> 00:01:39.750
<v Speaker 1>it's actually kind of like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>administrators are saying,</v>

35
00:01:39.751 --> 00:01:42.600
<v Speaker 1>oh by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do engage in cognitive distortions,</v>

36
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.520
<v Speaker 1>do engage in binary thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do overgeneralize and most of all,</v>

37
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.480
<v Speaker 1>catastrophizing all the time.</v>

38
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.600
<v Speaker 1>And I remember thinking somebody will be</v>
<v Speaker 1>affected as well.</v>

39
00:01:51.601 --> 00:01:53.880
<v Speaker 1>Thank goodness the students don't seem</v>
<v Speaker 1>to really be buying it.</v>

40
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.150
<v Speaker 1>And that's what changed in 2013,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2014 prior to 2013,</v>

41
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.980
<v Speaker 1>2014 since I started in 2001,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the worst constituency for free speech</v>

42
00:02:03.981 --> 00:02:07.190
<v Speaker 1>on campus was actually administrators</v>
<v Speaker 1>best,</v>

43
00:02:07.191 --> 00:02:10.850
<v Speaker 1>most reliable fans of free speech you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could run into on campus were generally</v>

44
00:02:10.851 --> 00:02:13.980
<v Speaker 1>the students themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then sometime around 2013,</v>

45
00:02:13.981 --> 00:02:16.000
<v Speaker 1>2014,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we saw a,</v>

46
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.730
<v Speaker 1>suddenly there were demanding everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>from trigger warnings to microaggression</v>

47
00:02:19.731 --> 00:02:22.850
<v Speaker 1>policies to December for even people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

48
00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.070
<v Speaker 1>but both on the left and the right on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the spectrum.</v>

49
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.440
<v Speaker 1>And it seemed like we said it seemed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen almost overnight and this and</v>

50
00:02:31.071 --> 00:02:36.071
<v Speaker 1>when I went to talk to John About it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now we've become friends through mutual</v>

51
00:02:36.081 --> 00:02:38.400
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said it's almost.</v>

52
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.240
<v Speaker 1>I talked about my whole theory that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're teaching a generation the habits</v>

53
00:02:42.241 --> 00:02:45.180
<v Speaker 1>of anxious and depressed people from</v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive behavioral therapy.</v>

54
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.750
<v Speaker 1>John got really excited about the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

55
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.020
<v Speaker 1>and asked if I wanted to write about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was already a fan of John's work.</v>

56
00:02:51.021 --> 00:02:52.160
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

57
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I thought that his,</v>

58
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.490
<v Speaker 1>his insight into what had changed was</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely brilliant.</v>

59
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.340
<v Speaker 1>I had just begun to notice this in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>own teaching.</v>

60
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.150
<v Speaker 1>I'd been teaching since 1995 at</v>
<v Speaker 1>University of Virginia originally,</v>

61
00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.900
<v Speaker 1>and it was seemingly overnight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right around 2014.</v>

62
00:03:08.901 --> 00:03:10.690
<v Speaker 1>These new ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>students,</v>

63
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:12.360
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>political,</v>

64
00:03:12.361 --> 00:03:14.230
<v Speaker 1>they protest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they object to things,</v>

65
00:03:14.231 --> 00:03:15.970
<v Speaker 1>but what was new grid?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put his finger on it.</v>

66
00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.100
<v Speaker 1>What was new was the idea that these</v>
<v Speaker 1>words are going to harm me,</v>

67
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.150
<v Speaker 1>not just defend me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just be unjust.</v>

68
00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.950
<v Speaker 1>Pardon me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to protect.</v>

69
00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.350
<v Speaker 1>It was this idea that students are</v>
<v Speaker 1>fragile and need protection and the</v>

70
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.980
<v Speaker 1>protection should come from</v>
<v Speaker 1>administrators,</v>

71
00:03:28.981 --> 00:03:31.500
<v Speaker 1>from adults.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what was new and disturbing.</v>

72
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will you guys talk in the book about</v>

73
00:03:33.491 --> 00:03:34.660
<v Speaker 2>Concept Creep?</v>

74
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.963
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

75
00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.900
<v Speaker 2>The overgeneralization of the idea of</v>
<v Speaker 2>trauma.</v>

76
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.550
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that's really struck</v>

77
00:03:42.551 --> 00:03:46.690
<v Speaker 2>me as interesting about the safe space</v>
<v Speaker 2>movement and the microaggression</v>

78
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.540
<v Speaker 2>policies and all of that is that it does</v>
<v Speaker 2>run so contrary to what every clinician</v>

79
00:03:51.541 --> 00:03:54.390
<v Speaker 2>worth his or her salt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those about treating anxiety or</v>

80
00:03:54.391 --> 00:03:55.224
<v Speaker 2>depression</v>

81
00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.430
<v Speaker 2>and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

82
00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.410
<v Speaker 2>so that's kind of a remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A phenomenon in itself is that what we</v>

83
00:04:03.411 --> 00:04:06.650
<v Speaker 2>know clinically has been absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 2>inverted by people who are</v>

84
00:04:06.651 --> 00:04:10.600
<v Speaker 2>hypothetically agitating on the part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>students' mental health and it's not as</v>

85
00:04:10.601 --> 00:04:15.601
<v Speaker 2>if the mental health community has stood</v>
<v Speaker 2>up on moss and denounced this.</v>

86
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.330
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I also don't.</v>

87
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also don't understand how we got here.</v>

88
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.700
<v Speaker 2>You guys talk in the book a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>about your little bit of.</v>

89
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.860
<v Speaker 2>You hypothesize a little bit about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>internet generation.</v>

90
00:04:29.861 --> 00:04:32.380
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those were the kids born after 1995.</v>

91
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.880
<v Speaker 2>You don't put the finger on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>millennials but.</v>

92
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.180
<v Speaker 2>But let's talk a little bit about why</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think things changed in 2013.</v>

93
00:04:40.181 --> 00:04:41.380
<v Speaker 2>In 2014.</v>

94
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.500
<v Speaker 1>Let me just first say your point about</v>
<v Speaker 1>these new ideas are not clinically</v>

95
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.860
<v Speaker 1>supported.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something that we suggest in the book.</v>

96
00:04:51.861 --> 00:04:54.520
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know if this is going on.</v>

97
00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:00.170
<v Speaker 1>To what extent is this a sincere desire</v>
<v Speaker 1>for protection and a sincere belief that</v>

98
00:05:00.391 --> 00:05:05.391
<v Speaker 1>students are fragile and to what extent</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it the pursuing of a political agenda</v>

99
00:05:05.601 --> 00:05:05.921
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

100
00:05:05.921 --> 00:05:09.320
<v Speaker 1>and making political points and using</v>
<v Speaker 1>mental health as a cover?</v>

101
00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.060
<v Speaker 1>I think both are operative and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

102
00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.790
<v Speaker 1>and it may depend on the context.</v>

103
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.290
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think the first one is</v>
<v Speaker 2>operative?</v>

104
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.390
<v Speaker 2>Because this runs so contrary to</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that's known about the actual</v>

105
00:05:23.391 --> 00:05:28.120
<v Speaker 2>protection of mental health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very skeptical about attributing a</v>

106
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.130
<v Speaker 2>positive motivation to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it seems to me that it's</v>

107
00:05:31.131 --> 00:05:33.020
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally driven by resentment.</v>

108
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:34.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so,</v>

109
00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're absolutely right that the</v>

110
00:05:36.701 --> 00:05:40.270
<v Speaker 1>psychological community does not support</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

111
00:05:40.271 --> 00:05:43.750
<v Speaker 1>but yet has not stood up very vocally to</v>
<v Speaker 1>condemn it.</v>

112
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.350
<v Speaker 1>So we are hopeful that psychologist and</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychiatrist,</v>

113
00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.830
<v Speaker 1>everyone we spoke to agreed that</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrongly,</v>

114
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.870
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly the worst thing to do for</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who suffers from ptsd,</v>

115
00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.600
<v Speaker 1>is to sweep their daily life of</v>
<v Speaker 1>reminders,</v>

116
00:05:59.601 --> 00:06:02.110
<v Speaker 1>thereby denying them the chance to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

117
00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.370
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the situation,</v>

118
00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.630
<v Speaker 1>to decondition the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

119
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.740
<v Speaker 1>the power of these triggers in the real</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

120
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:16.060
<v Speaker 2>It's worse in some sense because one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things you do when you expose people</v>

121
00:06:16.531 --> 00:06:21.030
<v Speaker 2>who have anxiety disorders to the things</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're anxious about is not make them</v>

122
00:06:21.031 --> 00:06:23.400
<v Speaker 2>less anxious but make them more</v>
<v Speaker 2>courageous.</v>

123
00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

124
00:06:24.421 --> 00:06:28.470
<v Speaker 2>And that's why generalizes because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychoanalysts thought that exposure</v>

125
00:06:28.471 --> 00:06:30.810
<v Speaker 2>would just mean the fears would pop up</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere else,</v>

126
00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:34.530
<v Speaker 2>but they don't and it's because people</v>
<v Speaker 2>learn that there's more to them than</v>

127
00:06:34.531 --> 00:06:36.840
<v Speaker 2>they thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then when you protect them,</v>

128
00:06:36.841 --> 00:06:39.840
<v Speaker 2>not only do not expose them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a big problem,</v>

129
00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.770
<v Speaker 2>but you also teach them to generalize</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea of their weakness,</v>

130
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.160
<v Speaker 2>which is a really terrible thing to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>to people.</v>

131
00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:49.620
<v Speaker 2>So you couldn't invent a more</v>
<v Speaker 2>counterproductive mental health</v>

132
00:06:49.621 --> 00:06:52.230
<v Speaker 2>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And instituted on campus is if you set</v>

133
00:06:52.231 --> 00:06:53.160
<v Speaker 2>out to design it.</v>

134
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.110
<v Speaker 1>That's something that we always try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>emphasize and so interesting for us to</v>

135
00:06:59.111 --> 00:07:02.740
<v Speaker 1>look at was the one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know the third anti free</v>

136
00:07:02.741 --> 00:07:06.110
<v Speaker 1>speech movement is coming from students</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the relatively recent past,</v>

137
00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.990
<v Speaker 1>so late eighties and early nineties for</v>
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

138
00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.190
<v Speaker 1>But the thing that was so striking was</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they were medicalizing all,</v>

139
00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.970
<v Speaker 1>all of these claims,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

140
00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:16.510
<v Speaker 1>they're sitting there going like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't sound right.</v>

141
00:07:16.511 --> 00:07:18.280
<v Speaker 1>And I talked to John and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't sound right.</v>

142
00:07:18.281 --> 00:07:19.870
<v Speaker 1>And we interviewed for the original</v>
<v Speaker 1>article,</v>

143
00:07:19.871 --> 00:07:22.800
<v Speaker 1>maybe seven different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the clinical psychologists,</v>

144
00:07:22.801 --> 00:07:23.950
<v Speaker 1>cbt experts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

145
00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:24.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

146
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:29.600
<v Speaker 1>And the thing I keep on trying keep on</v>
<v Speaker 1>explaining it as it's,</v>

147
00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:33.340
<v Speaker 1>as a fraternity of what could be a minor</v>
<v Speaker 1>version into something more like a</v>

148
00:07:33.341 --> 00:07:35.740
<v Speaker 1>phobia because we're giving it so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>more power.</v>

149
00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:39.100
<v Speaker 1>And the worst thing of all that we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing so much of our campuses,</v>

150
00:07:39.101 --> 00:07:43.120
<v Speaker 1>we're turning it into a Schema.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're turning the idea that I've broken</v>

151
00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:44.370
<v Speaker 1>into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

152
00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.110
<v Speaker 1>into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a permanent sort of self</v>

153
00:07:47.111 --> 00:07:49.300
<v Speaker 1>definition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why I do think that there's</v>

154
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:51.370
<v Speaker 1>sort of a mixed motive thing going on</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

155
00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.730
<v Speaker 1>I think that we have a self fulfilling</v>
<v Speaker 1>prophecy going on to some degree because</v>

156
00:07:54.731 --> 00:07:57.640
<v Speaker 1>I do think that some of this kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopeless ideology,</v>

157
00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:01.960
<v Speaker 1>he's actually genuinely Harvard students</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually making them more anxious and</v>

158
00:08:01.961 --> 00:08:02.380
<v Speaker 1>depressed.</v>
