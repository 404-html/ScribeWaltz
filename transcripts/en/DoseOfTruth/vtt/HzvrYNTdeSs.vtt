1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.500
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

2
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:00.780
<v Speaker 1>bins,</v>

3
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:01.650
<v Speaker 1>Wanger and boss.</v>

4
00:00:01.651 --> 00:00:04.260
<v Speaker 1>So they work mostly in the 1950s and as I said,</v>

5
00:00:04.261 --> 00:00:06.810
<v Speaker 1>they were very concerned about what had happened at World War Two.</v>

6
00:00:06.811 --> 00:00:10.620
<v Speaker 1>And so Dostoyevsky and Nichi had basically predicted that it was going to be</v>

7
00:00:10.621 --> 00:00:13.710
<v Speaker 1>nihilism or ideological totalitarianism.</v>

8
00:00:13.711 --> 00:00:15.840
<v Speaker 1>And that's basically exactly what happened.</v>

9
00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:16.674
<v Speaker 1>And by,</v>

10
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.280
<v Speaker 1>by the time the 1930s appeared on the horizon,</v>

11
00:00:20.281 --> 00:00:21.240
<v Speaker 1>the Germans had been,</v>

12
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.133
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.710
<v Speaker 1>they'd gone through an absolutely brutal first world war and then they went</v>

14
00:00:28.711 --> 00:00:31.890
<v Speaker 1>through hyperinflation of insane proportion.</v>

15
00:00:31.891 --> 00:00:36.840
<v Speaker 1>So in the 1920s Germany underwent this partly because they had such heavy war</v>

16
00:00:36.841 --> 00:00:38.400
<v Speaker 1>debts to pay for World War One.</v>

17
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.970
<v Speaker 1>The German German inflation got to the point where it was literally upwards of</v>

18
00:00:45.181 --> 00:00:48.060
<v Speaker 1>100 million marks to buy a loaf of bread,</v>

19
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.571
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

20
00:00:48.571 --> 00:00:52.470
<v Speaker 1>so they were taking wheelbarrows full of money to the grocery stores.</v>

21
00:00:52.471 --> 00:00:52.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

22
00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.440
<v Speaker 1>what happened was their currency devalued to zero.</v>

23
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.380
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

24
00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.340
<v Speaker 1>that actually happens to economies more often than you might think.</v>

25
00:00:59.341 --> 00:01:01.620
<v Speaker 1>So the thing just hit zero and that's that.</v>

26
00:01:01.621 --> 00:01:03.420
<v Speaker 1>And then it has to be rebooted,</v>

27
00:01:03.421 --> 00:01:04.051
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

28
00:01:04.051 --> 00:01:05.490
<v Speaker 1>So they had been,</v>

29
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.170
<v Speaker 1>the war was dreadful in hundreds of thousands of men were killed or brutalized.</v>

30
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.500
<v Speaker 1>Then their economy just absolutely fell apart.</v>

31
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.551
<v Speaker 1>And then of course,</v>

32
00:01:14.551 --> 00:01:15.540
<v Speaker 1>at the same time,</v>

33
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.580
<v Speaker 1>well a little bit earlier,</v>

34
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.040
<v Speaker 1>the revolution had taken place in Russia,</v>

35
00:01:20.041 --> 00:01:20.520
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

36
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.761
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

37
00:01:20.761 --> 00:01:24.210
<v Speaker 1>right at the end of the first world war and the communists had come to power and</v>

38
00:01:24.211 --> 00:01:27.210
<v Speaker 1>the communists were agitating all over Europe and in North America.</v>

39
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.960
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

40
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.220
<v Speaker 1>their goal was to,</v>

41
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.180
<v Speaker 1>to produce a communist revolution that was worldwide.</v>

42
00:01:33.181 --> 00:01:37.260
<v Speaker 1>And so the Germans were all shorted out that the communists were going to take</v>

43
00:01:37.261 --> 00:01:37.891
<v Speaker 1>over the country,</v>

44
00:01:37.891 --> 00:01:40.320
<v Speaker 1>which was a perfectly reasonable fear.</v>

45
00:01:40.321 --> 00:01:41.400
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

46
00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:42.270
<v Speaker 1>instead of that,</v>

47
00:01:42.271 --> 00:01:44.190
<v Speaker 1>what happened was that fascism,</v>

48
00:01:44.191 --> 00:01:46.330
<v Speaker 1>morose and fascism was a form of,</v>

49
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.360
<v Speaker 1>of state totalitarianism.</v>

50
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.930
<v Speaker 1>And I think the Germans were so desperate for order by that point,</v>

51
00:01:51.931 --> 00:01:52.470
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

52
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.600
<v Speaker 1>and that's what the fascists basically offered them,</v>

53
00:01:54.601 --> 00:01:55.590
<v Speaker 1>at least in theory.</v>

54
00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:56.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

55
00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.590
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately as it turned out,</v>

56
00:01:58.591 --> 00:02:02.580
<v Speaker 1>they offered them a little bit too much order or maybe a lot too much order and</v>

57
00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:04.110
<v Speaker 1>things went dreadfully south.</v>

58
00:02:04.111 --> 00:02:04.840
<v Speaker 1>But then,</v>

59
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.131
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

60
00:02:05.131 --> 00:02:09.490
<v Speaker 1>so then the whole world had to walk through the horrors of World War Two.</v>

61
00:02:09.491 --> 00:02:09.990
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

62
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.390
<v Speaker 1>and it was shocking in a variety of ways,</v>

63
00:02:12.391 --> 00:02:14.520
<v Speaker 1>not only because of the brutality of the warfare,</v>

64
00:02:14.521 --> 00:02:18.810
<v Speaker 1>but because of the genocidal actions that took place consciously by the Nazis.</v>

65
00:02:18.811 --> 00:02:19.740
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

66
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.750
<v Speaker 1>and those actions were in many ways,</v>

67
00:02:21.751 --> 00:02:23.220
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to understand,</v>

68
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.493
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

69
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.530
<v Speaker 1>mean here's why they're particularly difficult to understand.</v>

70
00:02:28.531 --> 00:02:28.740
<v Speaker 1>There,</v>

71
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.740
<v Speaker 1>there were certainly times where the brutality that the Nazis employed in their</v>

72
00:02:34.561 --> 00:02:39.561
<v Speaker 1>eradication of their theoretical enemies far surpassed the necessity for the</v>

73
00:02:40.801 --> 00:02:41.970
<v Speaker 1>mere eradication.</v>

74
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.050
<v Speaker 1>But even worse than that,</v>

75
00:02:43.051 --> 00:02:47.250
<v Speaker 1>so it went past eradication into real torture constantly.</v>

76
00:02:47.251 --> 00:02:48.570
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>

77
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.330
<v Speaker 1>there are many situations in which the Nazis,</v>

78
00:02:51.331 --> 00:02:52.530
<v Speaker 1>especially near the end of the war,</v>

79
00:02:52.531 --> 00:02:56.490
<v Speaker 1>they had to decide really whether they were going to continue exterminating Jews</v>

80
00:02:56.491 --> 00:03:00.490
<v Speaker 1>and Gypsies and homosexuals and all the people they felt didn't fit into their</v>

81
00:03:00.491 --> 00:03:02.800
<v Speaker 1>culture or whether they were going to win the war.</v>

82
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:06.520
<v Speaker 1>And there were decisions they had to make about the distribution of resources</v>

83
00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:09.880
<v Speaker 1>where if they were going to pursue the genocidal extermination,</v>

84
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.640
<v Speaker 1>that would mean it would decrease the probability that they would win.</v>

85
00:03:12.641 --> 00:03:14.080
<v Speaker 1>The war not happened a lot,</v>

86
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.130
<v Speaker 1>especially at the end,</v>

87
00:03:15.131 --> 00:03:18.280
<v Speaker 1>and the Nazis always picked continuing the extermination.</v>

88
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.590
<v Speaker 1>Now that's pretty damn interesting,</v>

89
00:03:20.591 --> 00:03:20.801
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

90
00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:21.700
<v Speaker 1>because you can think,</v>

91
00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:22.330
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

92
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.163
<v Speaker 1>on the one hand,</v>

93
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.191
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

94
00:03:24.191 --> 00:03:24.490
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

95
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.490
<v Speaker 1>if they are serving a creed and the creed is world domination and this is the</v>

96
00:03:29.711 --> 00:03:34.711
<v Speaker 1>extermination processes are considered a step towards the actual end point,</v>

97
00:03:36.071 --> 00:03:39.430
<v Speaker 1>which is the establishment of a world state of fascist world state,</v>

98
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.470
<v Speaker 1>or at least a fascist European state,</v>

99
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.360
<v Speaker 1>then you would think that the extermination attempts would be subordinate to</v>

100
00:03:46.361 --> 00:03:49.630
<v Speaker 1>that goal if they were actually pursuing the goal that they said they were</v>

101
00:03:49.631 --> 00:03:50.110
<v Speaker 1>pursuing.</v>
