1
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.010
<v Speaker 1>We had to,</v>

2
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:10.953
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.930
<v Speaker 1>some of your recent conversations with people is we're operating at different</v>

4
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.500
<v Speaker 1>levels,</v>

5
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.850
<v Speaker 1>so Depok fruits,</v>

6
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.440
<v Speaker 1>apple pounds,</v>

7
00:00:19.441 --> 00:00:24.441
<v Speaker 1>me with articles about quantum physics that show their material stuff is really</v>

8
00:00:24.901 --> 00:00:25.860
<v Speaker 1>just energy.</v>

9
00:00:25.861 --> 00:00:28.920
<v Speaker 1>Atoms are mostly empty space and so forth.</v>

10
00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:29.401
<v Speaker 1>Then you know,</v>

11
00:00:29.401 --> 00:00:29.641
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

12
00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:30.600
<v Speaker 1>this table is,</v>

13
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:30.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.670
<v Speaker 1>it's actually mostly empty space.</v>

15
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.320
<v Speaker 1>This is all true,</v>

16
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.940
<v Speaker 1>but we don't live at the quantum level.</v>

17
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.960
<v Speaker 1>You live at the pro level where I'm sitting in a chair and I'm not passing</v>

18
00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:41.790
<v Speaker 1>through it because at that,</v>

19
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:42.773
<v Speaker 1>at this level,</v>

20
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:43.081
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:00:43.081 --> 00:00:43.261
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

22
00:00:43.261 --> 00:00:44.310
<v Speaker 1>it's not the same as that,</v>

23
00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:45.180
<v Speaker 1>the quantum level.</v>

24
00:00:45.181 --> 00:00:46.014
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

25
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.400
<v Speaker 1>and I think making that distinction helps clarify a lot of things.</v>

26
00:00:50.401 --> 00:00:55.401
<v Speaker 1>So like when you talk about the truth to be found in a biblical stories are,</v>

27
00:00:55.801 --> 00:00:56.760
<v Speaker 1>or literary stories,</v>

28
00:00:56.761 --> 00:00:57.840
<v Speaker 1>like that's the SD or,</v>

29
00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.610
<v Speaker 1>or Shakespeare or whatever.</v>

30
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.340
<v Speaker 1>And a material scientist says,</v>

31
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:02.700
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

32
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.091
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

33
00:01:03.091 --> 00:01:04.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean something different by truth.</v>

34
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:06.390
<v Speaker 1>It's not that one of you is right,</v>

35
00:01:06.391 --> 00:01:07.081
<v Speaker 1>the other's wrong.</v>

36
00:01:07.081 --> 00:01:11.160
<v Speaker 1>It's just that these are different levels or different ways of talking about</v>

37
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:14.640
<v Speaker 1>different toolkits.</v>

38
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

39
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.010
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

40
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.381
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

41
00:01:16.381 --> 00:01:17.191
<v Speaker 1>Different tool kits.</v>

42
00:01:17.191 --> 00:01:17.551
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

43
00:01:17.551 --> 00:01:18.384
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

44
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.820
<v Speaker 2>Kind of the classic American pragmatist,</v>

45
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.780
<v Speaker 2>I think of these things as tools.</v>

46
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.270
<v Speaker 2>There's a scientific tool kit and there's a tool kit for action in the world and</v>

47
00:01:29.271 --> 00:01:29.931
<v Speaker 2>they overlap,</v>

48
00:01:29.931 --> 00:01:30.920
<v Speaker 2>but they're not the same.</v>

49
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.130
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

50
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.990
<v Speaker 1>I call this,</v>

51
00:01:33.991 --> 00:01:34.824
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

52
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.210
<v Speaker 1>Elvis error,</v>

53
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.590
<v Speaker 1>Alvie singer,</v>

54
00:01:37.591 --> 00:01:39.480
<v Speaker 1>they character in woody Allen's film,</v>

55
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:40.770
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

56
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:41.603
<v Speaker 1>any hall.</v>

57
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.480
<v Speaker 1>And there's that funny scene where there's a flashback to where he's in</v>

58
00:01:45.481 --> 00:01:49.680
<v Speaker 1>childhood and he's refused to do his homework and he's depressed and his mother</v>

59
00:01:49.681 --> 00:01:51.450
<v Speaker 1>takes him to the doctor or psychiatrist,</v>

60
00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.021
<v Speaker 1>whoever he is.</v>

61
00:01:52.021 --> 00:01:52.740
<v Speaker 1>And okay,</v>

62
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.971
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

63
00:01:52.971 --> 00:01:54.110
<v Speaker 1>why are you depressed?</v>

64
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.270
<v Speaker 1>Because I found out that the universe is expanding.</v>

65
00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.883
<v Speaker 1>So what?</v>

66
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.890
<v Speaker 1>Because if the universe is expanding and then eventually it's all going to blow</v>

67
00:02:01.891 --> 00:02:03.210
<v Speaker 1>up and nothing means anything.</v>

68
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.090
<v Speaker 1>Others names Adam,</v>

69
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.630
<v Speaker 1>we live in Brooklyn.</v>

70
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.450
<v Speaker 1>Brooklyn's not expanding and how to do homework.</v>

71
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.260
<v Speaker 2>That's a nice observation I think too,</v>

72
00:02:13.261 --> 00:02:14.400
<v Speaker 2>because so,</v>

73
00:02:14.401 --> 00:02:14.820
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

74
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.160
<v Speaker 2>let's go back to the conceptualization issues.</v>

75
00:02:17.161 --> 00:02:19.260
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things that we've agreed on,</v>

76
00:02:19.261 --> 00:02:22.230
<v Speaker 2>and I don't want to lose track of that thread because I think it's useful,</v>

77
00:02:22.231 --> 00:02:27.231
<v Speaker 2>is that we do see an iconic reality and the icons have practical utility,</v>

78
00:02:27.901 --> 00:02:32.901
<v Speaker 2>but they also bear some one to one correspondence with the thing in itself and</v>

79
00:02:33.331 --> 00:02:35.810
<v Speaker 2>it's low resolution is a nice way of thinking about,</v>

80
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.550
<v Speaker 2>so they're low resolution icons with functional utility.</v>

81
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.100
<v Speaker 2>Now the question would be,</v>

82
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.520
<v Speaker 2>so then what that makes clear is that without human consciousness,</v>

83
00:02:44.521 --> 00:02:45.900
<v Speaker 2>all that disappears.</v>

84
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.650
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

85
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:47.430
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

86
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.430
<v Speaker 2>Then the question is partly what is there outside of that functional iconic</v>

87
00:02:53.161 --> 00:02:54.060
<v Speaker 2>representation.</v>

88
00:02:54.061 --> 00:02:56.610
<v Speaker 2>And so that would be the old question of the thing in itself.</v>

89
00:02:56.611 --> 00:02:57.930
<v Speaker 2>And you could say,</v>

90
00:02:57.931 --> 00:03:02.620
<v Speaker 2>and I think you could say with some justification that the thing in itself is in</v>

91
00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:07.540
<v Speaker 2>potential something that collapses across time and space so that it's everything</v>

92
00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:08.890
<v Speaker 2>and nothing at the same time,</v>

93
00:03:08.891 --> 00:03:11.440
<v Speaker 2>which is I guess that's an eastern claim.</v>

94
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.870
<v Speaker 2>That's one way of thinking about it or to Dallas claim.</v>

95
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.110
<v Speaker 2>And I like it because the problem with the,</v>

96
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.790
<v Speaker 2>or the,</v>

97
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:18.760
<v Speaker 2>one of the issues that,</v>

98
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.100
<v Speaker 2>and this is associated with the idea of Brooklyn,</v>

99
00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:24.160
<v Speaker 2>it's not only does lb is it they all be your LV,</v>

100
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.120
<v Speaker 2>LV,</v>

101
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.610
<v Speaker 2>LV not only does healthy live in Brooklyn,</v>

102
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.040
<v Speaker 2>he lives in Brooklyn now,</v>

103
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.260
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

104
00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.390
<v Speaker 2>And so it's spatially located and temporarily located.</v>

105
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.580
<v Speaker 2>And so his mother's objection is,</v>

106
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.540
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

107
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.260
<v Speaker 2>don't pick a reference point that makes everything right now we irrelevant,</v>

108
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:42.040
<v Speaker 2>which I,</v>

109
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.030
<v Speaker 2>which is really good practical psychological advice because one of the things</v>

110
00:03:46.031 --> 00:03:50.920
<v Speaker 2>that leads people down the path of nihilism is this claim that this observation</v>

111
00:03:50.921 --> 00:03:54.550
<v Speaker 2>that you can pick a time frame of analysis that makes your current action</v>

112
00:03:54.551 --> 00:03:55.384
<v Speaker 2>useless.</v>

113
00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.650
<v Speaker 2>Who's going to care in a million years.</v>

114
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:00.581
<v Speaker 1>The is that,</v>

115
00:04:00.581 --> 00:04:01.950
<v Speaker 1>argues it,</v>

116
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:02.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

117
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.070
<v Speaker 1>without God,</v>

118
00:04:03.071 --> 00:04:07.180
<v Speaker 1>without some sort of external source for morality and meaning nothing.</v>

119
00:04:07.181 --> 00:04:07.690
<v Speaker 1>What we're,</v>

120
00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.510
<v Speaker 1>nothing we do matters because in 15 billion years,</v>

121
00:04:10.511 --> 00:04:10.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

122
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.760
<v Speaker 1>the heat death of the universe or whatever,</v>

123
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:14.950
<v Speaker 1>we don't live 15 billion years from now.</v>

124
00:04:14.951 --> 00:04:16.360
<v Speaker 1>We live now here.</v>

125
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.310
<v Speaker 1>And what we do does matter.</v>

126
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.330
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

127
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.571
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

128
00:04:19.571 --> 00:04:20.540
<v Speaker 1>so like the,</v>

129
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:21.251
<v Speaker 1>this would argue,</v>

130
00:04:21.251 --> 00:04:21.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

131
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.140
<v Speaker 1>the theodicy problem,</v>

132
00:04:23.141 --> 00:04:23.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

133
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.940
<v Speaker 1>without God,</v>

134
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.060
<v Speaker 1>there's no right or wrong,</v>

135
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.560
<v Speaker 1>whatever Stalin did or Hitler did is perfectly fine because of the heat death of</v>

136
00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:30.070
<v Speaker 1>the universe.</v>

137
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.341
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

138
00:04:30.341 --> 00:04:34.540
<v Speaker 1>it's not fine because the people that are suffering in the Gulag archipelago or</v>

139
00:04:34.541 --> 00:04:35.530
<v Speaker 1>in the gas chambers,</v>

140
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:36.813
<v Speaker 1>that outfits,</v>

141
00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.400
<v Speaker 1>they're not thinking about 15 billion years from now.</v>

142
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.620
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

143
00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.080
<v Speaker 1>they're living right here right now.</v>

144
00:04:41.081 --> 00:04:42.910
<v Speaker 1>The torture is really doing wrong,</v>

145
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.650
<v Speaker 1>like these standards.</v>

146
00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:45.484
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>

147
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.250
<v Speaker 1>the level at which we're talking about is everything.</v>
