1
00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.580
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that happens in the old testament is Israel struggles up to</v>

2
00:00:10.581 --> 00:00:15.260
<v Speaker 1>state and empire status six times its struggles out of the chaos,</v>

3
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.790
<v Speaker 1>up to empire status,</v>

4
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.650
<v Speaker 1>and then it gets corrupt.</v>

5
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.230
<v Speaker 1>It loses the way it isn't.</v>

6
00:00:21.231 --> 00:00:25.640
<v Speaker 1>Balancing things between chaos and order properly that the kings get arrogant.</v>

7
00:00:25.641 --> 00:00:28.700
<v Speaker 1>It's so to the people and they forget their relationship with God.</v>

8
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.290
<v Speaker 1>That's another way of thinking about it.</v>

9
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.940
<v Speaker 1>And then a profit comes up and says,</v>

10
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.120
<v Speaker 1>you aren't paying enough attention to the widows and the orphans.</v>

11
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.770
<v Speaker 1>You better look out because that displeases God and the Israelites who are stiff</v>

12
00:00:39.771 --> 00:00:43.520
<v Speaker 1>necked and arrogant think what's God going to do to us,</v>

13
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.620
<v Speaker 1>which is not a very wise way of thinking.</v>

14
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.960
<v Speaker 1>And so they don't take the steps necessary to rectify their deviation from the</v>

15
00:00:50.961 --> 00:00:51.794
<v Speaker 1>proper path.</v>

16
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.600
<v Speaker 1>And they get absolutely flattened and the consequences of that last for</v>

17
00:00:56.601 --> 00:00:57.500
<v Speaker 1>generations,</v>

18
00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.210
<v Speaker 1>like seven generations.</v>

19
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.260
<v Speaker 1>And then they struggle their way up to something approximating empire status</v>

20
00:01:03.261 --> 00:01:04.070
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

21
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.930
<v Speaker 1>And exactly the same thing happens.</v>

22
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.510
<v Speaker 1>They forget and they collapse.</v>

23
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.240
<v Speaker 1>And there's six stories like that in the Old Testament.</v>

24
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.150
<v Speaker 1>It's all deep documented by a man named Northrop Frye,</v>

25
00:01:14.151 --> 00:01:18.170
<v Speaker 1>who is a Canadian literary critic who wrote a couple of books on the Bible,</v>

26
00:01:18.171 --> 00:01:20.840
<v Speaker 1>one called the great code and the other called words with power,</v>

27
00:01:20.841 --> 00:01:22.400
<v Speaker 1>which I would highly recommend.</v>

28
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.770
<v Speaker 1>It's an analysis of the Bible as literature.</v>

29
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:25.640
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant.</v>

30
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.070
<v Speaker 1>For those of you who might be interested in union thinking,</v>

31
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.770
<v Speaker 1>Fry's thinking is a nice adjunct.</v>

32
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.380
<v Speaker 1>So all right,</v>

33
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.253
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

34
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.480
<v Speaker 1>so that's the nature of the world order chaos and order.</v>

35
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.570
<v Speaker 1>And your goal is to keep those,</v>

36
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.180
<v Speaker 1>the relationship between those two things optimized.</v>

37
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.490
<v Speaker 1>And you do that by doing what's meaningful,</v>

38
00:01:46.491 --> 00:01:47.780
<v Speaker 1>not what's expedient.</v>

39
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.020
<v Speaker 1>That's rule six and you ensure that you have the world construed property by</v>

40
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:55.550
<v Speaker 1>following rule number eight,</v>

41
00:01:55.551 --> 00:01:56.930
<v Speaker 1>which is tell the truth,</v>

42
00:01:56.931 --> 00:01:58.280
<v Speaker 1>or at least don't lie.</v>

43
00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.570
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to pathologize the instinct that orients you in the world and you</v>

44
00:02:02.571 --> 00:02:05.870
<v Speaker 1>will pathologize it by engaging in habitual deceit.</v>

45
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.810
<v Speaker 1>And the reason you do that is when you practice something,</v>

46
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.550
<v Speaker 1>you build structures that specialize in that and then they run automatically.</v>

47
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.350
<v Speaker 1>So if you're living a lie,</v>

48
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.450
<v Speaker 1>which is a very common thing for people to do,</v>

49
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.780
<v Speaker 1>then you're building neurological mechanisms that view the world through that</v>

50
00:02:20.781 --> 00:02:21.380
<v Speaker 1>lie.</v>

51
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.430
<v Speaker 1>And once they're built,</v>

52
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.580
<v Speaker 1>they're you and good luck unbuilding them.</v>

53
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.451
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

54
00:02:26.451 --> 00:02:27.141
<v Speaker 1>very difficult.</v>

55
00:02:27.141 --> 00:02:30.980
<v Speaker 1>That's in part what happens to people who are addicted by the way they build</v>

56
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.140
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms of search,</v>

57
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.090
<v Speaker 1>neurological structures that are focused on the drug and those systems are alive</v>

58
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.850
<v Speaker 1>and all they want is the drug and they're,</v>

59
00:02:40.851 --> 00:02:41.421
<v Speaker 1>they're not,</v>

60
00:02:41.421 --> 00:02:42.830
<v Speaker 1>it's not psychological.</v>

61
00:02:42.831 --> 00:02:43.640
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

62
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.640
<v Speaker 1>It's psychophysiological don't build structures of cognition predicated on</v>

63
00:02:49.191 --> 00:02:51.410
<v Speaker 1>deception because you will pay for it.</v>

64
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.610
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're going to guide your life with the orientation of the instinct</v>

65
00:02:55.611 --> 00:02:56.330
<v Speaker 1>of meaning,</v>

66
00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.280
<v Speaker 1>then you have to be very careful with what you say and write and think.</v>

67
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.370
<v Speaker 1>Because every time you say or write or think something,</v>

68
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.210
<v Speaker 1>you build a little neurological structure that's specialized for that and it</v>

69
00:03:07.211 --> 00:03:09.520
<v Speaker 1>participates in this parsing of the world.</v>

70
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.770
<v Speaker 1>So all right,</v>

71
00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:19.550
<v Speaker 1>chaos and order.</v>

72
00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.980
<v Speaker 1>Then you can say the order orders a hierarchy.</v>

73
00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.391
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

74
00:03:23.391 --> 00:03:24.620
<v Speaker 1>so here's the next question.</v>

75
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.170
<v Speaker 1>Next two questions is order a hierarchy.</v>

76
00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.250
<v Speaker 1>And then a subsidiary question would be,</v>

77
00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.200
<v Speaker 1>if order is a hierarchy,</v>

78
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:37.293
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>

79
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.820
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

80
00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.110
<v Speaker 1>either what is at the top of the hierarchy or what should be at the top of the</v>

81
00:03:42.111 --> 00:03:44.090
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy instead of hierarchies,</v>

82
00:03:44.091 --> 00:03:44.990
<v Speaker 1>a structure value.</v>

83
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.190
<v Speaker 1>So that's the question is what should be of all come at value.</v>

84
00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.720
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

85
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.670
<v Speaker 1>so now we're going to take that apart a little bit.</v>

86
00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.020
<v Speaker 1>The first thing I would say is order is not a hierarchy.</v>

87
00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.290
<v Speaker 1>Order is a set of hierarchies.</v>

88
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.690
<v Speaker 1>That's a different thing.</v>

89
00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.273
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

90
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.830
<v Speaker 1>uh.</v>
