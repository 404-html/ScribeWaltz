00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.550
<v Speaker 1>How are you doing?</v>

2
00:00:08.551 --> 00:00:09.840
<v Speaker 1>Someone is asking me,</v>

3
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.650
<v Speaker 1>you said some place that you felt like you were at times dancing on broken</v>

4
00:00:16.651 --> 00:00:16.951
<v Speaker 1>glass.</v>

5
00:00:16.951 --> 00:00:17.131
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

6
00:00:17.131 --> 00:00:18.180
<v Speaker 1>I think I said that I was,</v>

7
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.150
<v Speaker 1>I always felt like I was dancing on broken glass.</v>

8
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.980
<v Speaker 1>Are you getting enough rest and R.</v>

9
00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:25.890
<v Speaker 1>And R is the food sensitivity getting worked out?</v>

10
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.070
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe the food sensitivity thing is getting worked out.</v>

11
00:00:29.071 --> 00:00:34.071
<v Speaker 1>I think it's at the basis of this depression that's been played in my family for</v>

12
00:00:34.711 --> 00:00:35.610
<v Speaker 1>generations,</v>

13
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.220
<v Speaker 1>but I haven't figured out exactly what it is.</v>

14
00:00:38.221 --> 00:00:38.431
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

15
00:00:38.431 --> 00:00:39.030
<v Speaker 1>Town.</v>

16
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm working very hard on that with my daughter who also seems to have the same</v>

17
00:00:42.331 --> 00:00:43.021
<v Speaker 1>problem and it,</v>

18
00:00:43.021 --> 00:00:44.490
<v Speaker 1>it is absolutely brutal.</v>

19
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.230
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely brutal.</v>

20
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:47.490
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

21
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:48.323
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

22
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.530
<v Speaker 1>am I getting enough rest?</v>

23
00:00:49.531 --> 00:00:49.921
<v Speaker 1>And R.</v>

24
00:00:49.921 --> 00:00:50.754
<v Speaker 1>And R,</v>

25
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.020
<v Speaker 1>that's hard to say because with the responses that I'd been having that have</v>

26
00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:56.100
<v Speaker 1>knocked my health back,</v>

27
00:00:56.101 --> 00:00:56.261
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

28
00:00:56.261 --> 00:00:59.390
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to discriminate between rest and our and our,</v>

29
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.130
<v Speaker 1>the lack of that and just getting walloped by,</v>

30
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.740
<v Speaker 1>by eating what appears to be the wrong thing.</v>

31
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.050
<v Speaker 1>So it's so funny because,</v>

32
00:01:07.051 --> 00:01:07.321
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:01:07.321 --> 00:01:12.321
<v Speaker 1>for years I was very skeptical of anyone who was concerned about,</v>

34
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.471
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:01:13.471 --> 00:01:15.360
<v Speaker 1>gluten sensitivity and that sort of thing.</v>

36
00:01:15.361 --> 00:01:17.220
<v Speaker 1>But I sure learned that that was,</v>

37
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:18.240
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

38
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.073
<v Speaker 1>arrogant.</v>

39
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.153
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

40
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:21.240
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

41
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.451
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

42
00:01:21.451 --> 00:01:25.440
<v Speaker 1>I've found many times in my life that you have to be aware of what you are</v>

43
00:01:25.441 --> 00:01:28.230
<v Speaker 1>judgmental about because many things come back to haunt you.</v>
