<v Speaker 1>How does one save a marriage when it seems that there is no longer attraction</v>

2
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.700
<v Speaker 1>both physically and intellectually?</v>

3
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:12.750
<v Speaker 1>There are kids involved,</v>

4
00:00:12.751 --> 00:00:15.240
<v Speaker 1>which is the main reason for wanting to save the marriage.</v>

5
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:16.763
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

6
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:17.693
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

7
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:18.540
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

8
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.160
<v Speaker 1>I know a couple of things about that.</v>

9
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:20.941
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

10
00:00:20.941 --> 00:00:25.941
<v Speaker 1>the first thing I would say is that if you haven't had any intimate interaction</v>

11
00:00:26.941 --> 00:00:29.250
<v Speaker 1>with one another for quite a long period of time,</v>

12
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.640
<v Speaker 1>that can put both people into a stagnant state where desire starts to slip away.</v>

13
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:36.360
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

14
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.340
<v Speaker 1>what sex therapists recommend under such conditions is to while essentially</v>

15
00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:42.720
<v Speaker 1>start in some way,</v>

16
00:00:42.721 --> 00:00:43.920
<v Speaker 1>start dating again.</v>

17
00:00:43.921 --> 00:00:47.250
<v Speaker 1>So you could ask your partner to go out to a movie or something like that.</v>

18
00:00:47.251 --> 00:00:48.330
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

19
00:00:48.331 --> 00:00:50.940
<v Speaker 1>maybe when you come home you could,</v>

20
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.510
<v Speaker 1>you could neck for a little while.</v>

21
00:00:54.511 --> 00:00:55.440
<v Speaker 1>Like teenagers,</v>

22
00:00:55.441 --> 00:00:57.960
<v Speaker 1>that's probably a word that no one uses anymore,</v>

23
00:00:57.961 --> 00:01:00.750
<v Speaker 1>but kind of pull back and you got to agree,</v>

24
00:01:00.751 --> 00:01:01.710
<v Speaker 1>say not to,</v>

25
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.640
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

26
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.120
<v Speaker 1>engage in full sexual activity for a while,</v>

27
00:01:06.121 --> 00:01:08.190
<v Speaker 1>but to tease each other and to play a bit.</v>

28
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.410
<v Speaker 1>Even if you're not attracted,</v>

29
00:01:10.411 --> 00:01:11.390
<v Speaker 1>you have to act,</v>

30
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.240
<v Speaker 1>act it out for awhile and hopefully you can get the motor running again.</v>

31
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.550
<v Speaker 1>The other thing I would say is that you guys might want to sit down and make a</v>

32
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.630
<v Speaker 1>joint plan.</v>

33
00:01:21.631 --> 00:01:23.370
<v Speaker 1>It's like what?</v>

34
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:24.570
<v Speaker 1>Cause I,</v>

35
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.570
<v Speaker 1>a marriage is like a story that two people are acting out simultaneously and you</v>

36
00:01:29.641 --> 00:01:34.641
<v Speaker 1>have to have shared goals and because you're both rowing the same boat,</v>

37
00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:36.331
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

38
00:01:36.331 --> 00:01:38.880
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't have a destination in mind,</v>

39
00:01:38.881 --> 00:01:39.570
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>

40
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.250
<v Speaker 1>well maybe you're rowing in circles or maybe you're just standing still.</v>

41
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.620
<v Speaker 1>So I would say work hard to put some romance back in the relationship.</v>

42
00:01:49.621 --> 00:01:49.861
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

43
00:01:49.861 --> 00:01:50.960
<v Speaker 1>you could say to each other,</v>

44
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.211
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

45
00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:53.850
<v Speaker 1>let's try this for six months and just see how it goes.</v>

46
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.330
<v Speaker 1>We'll have two dates a week for the first month.</v>

47
00:01:57.331 --> 00:01:58.320
<v Speaker 1>We won't have any sex,</v>

48
00:01:58.321 --> 00:02:00.540
<v Speaker 1>but we'll play around and then,</v>

49
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.111
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

50
00:02:01.111 --> 00:02:02.580
<v Speaker 1>we'll see how that goes and,</v>

51
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.970
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

52
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.170
<v Speaker 1>but we'll try it out for the,</v>

53
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:05.321
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

54
00:02:05.321 --> 00:02:06.180
<v Speaker 1>for the whole,</v>

55
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.340
<v Speaker 1>for the whole six months.</v>

56
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

57
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.890
<v Speaker 1>there are reasons to save a marriage.</v>

58
00:02:10.891 --> 00:02:11.131
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

59
00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:12.210
<v Speaker 1>it's hard on kids.</v>

60
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.870
<v Speaker 1>Divorce is really hard on kids and it's hard on the adults involved too.</v>

61
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:17.460
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

62
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.791
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

63
00:02:17.791 --> 00:02:18.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

64
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.283
<v Speaker 1>I would say</v>

65
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.800
<v Speaker 1>you have to negotiate an agreement and you,</v>

66
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

67
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.330
<v Speaker 1>you could try the future authoring program,</v>

68
00:02:27.331 --> 00:02:27.841
<v Speaker 1>both of you.</v>

69
00:02:27.841 --> 00:02:29.640
<v Speaker 1>What I would recommend for example,</v>

70
00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:32.490
<v Speaker 1>is that you each do the future authoring program separately.</v>

71
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.020
<v Speaker 1>So that's that self authoring.com cause then you both have a life plan and then</v>

72
00:02:37.021 --> 00:02:42.021
<v Speaker 1>you could sit down and read each other's future authoring plans and see if you</v>

73
00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:45.780
<v Speaker 1>have some things in common and then see if you can figure out how to support</v>

74
00:02:45.781 --> 00:02:49.950
<v Speaker 1>each other with regards to each of you obtaining what you want.</v>
