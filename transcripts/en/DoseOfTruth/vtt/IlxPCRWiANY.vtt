1
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:04.470
<v Speaker 1>So you act things out,</v>

2
00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:04.741
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3
00:00:04.741 --> 00:00:06.210
<v Speaker 1>Do you act things out?</v>

4
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.490
<v Speaker 1>And that's a kind of competence.</v>

5
00:00:08.491 --> 00:00:12.360
<v Speaker 1>And then you imagine what you act out and you imagine what everyone else acts</v>

6
00:00:12.361 --> 00:00:12.571
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

7
00:00:12.571 --> 00:00:16.320
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a tremendous amount of inflammation in your action.</v>

8
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.610
<v Speaker 1>And then that information is translated up into the dream and into art,</v>

9
00:00:20.611 --> 00:00:22.020
<v Speaker 1>into mythology and literature.</v>

10
00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:25.080
<v Speaker 1>And there's a tremendous amount of information in that.</v>

11
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.310
<v Speaker 1>And then some of that is translated into articulated thought.</v>

12
00:00:29.311 --> 00:00:31.650
<v Speaker 1>And I'll give you a quick example of something like that.</v>

13
00:00:31.651 --> 00:00:36.090
<v Speaker 1>I think this is partly what happens in exodus when Moses comes up with the law,</v>

14
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.421
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:00:36.421 --> 00:00:39.340
<v Speaker 1>he's wandering around with the Israelites forever and the desert and they're,</v>

16
00:00:39.341 --> 00:00:42.810
<v Speaker 1>they're like going left and going right and worshiping idols and like having a</v>

17
00:00:42.811 --> 00:00:44.700
<v Speaker 1>hell of a time and um,</v>

18
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:45.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

19
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.380
<v Speaker 1>get in rebellious and Moses goes up on the mountain and he has this tremendous</v>

20
00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:52.800
<v Speaker 1>revelation sort of in the sight of God and illuminates him.</v>

21
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.630
<v Speaker 1>And he comes down with the law.</v>

22
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.051
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>

23
00:00:55.051 --> 00:00:55.620
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

24
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:55.801
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

25
00:00:55.801 --> 00:00:57.420
<v Speaker 1>Moses acted as a judge.</v>

26
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.190
<v Speaker 1>I know this is a mythological story.</v>

27
00:00:59.191 --> 00:01:01.500
<v Speaker 1>Moses acted as a judge in the desert.</v>

28
00:01:01.501 --> 00:01:05.430
<v Speaker 1>He was continually mediating between people who are having problems constantly</v>

29
00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:06.660
<v Speaker 1>trying to keep peace.</v>

30
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.150
<v Speaker 1>And so what are you doing when you're turning to keep pieces?</v>

31
00:01:09.151 --> 00:01:11.100
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to understand what peace is,</v>

32
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.730
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

33
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.530
<v Speaker 1>You have to apply the principles.</v>

34
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

35
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:14.880
<v Speaker 1>what are the principles?</v>

36
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:15.061
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

37
00:01:15.061 --> 00:01:19.920
<v Speaker 1>you don't know the principals or whatever satisfies people enough to make peace</v>

38
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.040
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you do that 10,000 times and then you get some sense of,</v>

39
00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:23.251
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

40
00:01:23.251 --> 00:01:25.380
<v Speaker 1>here's the principles that bring peace.</v>

41
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.270
<v Speaker 1>And then one day it blasts into your consciousness like,</v>

42
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.430
<v Speaker 1>like a revelation.</v>

43
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.340
<v Speaker 1>Here's the rules that were already acting out.</v>

44
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.990
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the 10 commandments.</v>

45
00:01:33.991 --> 00:01:34.141
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

46
00:01:34.141 --> 00:01:37.290
<v Speaker 1>they're there to begin with and Moses comes forward and says,</v>

47
00:01:37.291 --> 00:01:37.770
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

48
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.020
<v Speaker 1>this is already basically what we're doing,</v>

49
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.520
<v Speaker 1>but now it's codafide.</v>

50
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.060
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

51
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.980
<v Speaker 1>And like that's all historical process that's condensed into a single story.</v>

52
00:01:46.981 --> 00:01:50.520
<v Speaker 1>But obviously that happened because we have written law,</v>

53
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:51.061
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

54
00:01:51.061 --> 00:01:52.110
<v Speaker 1>And that emerged in,</v>

55
00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:55.140
<v Speaker 1>in good legal systems that emerges from the bottom up.</v>

56
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.981
<v Speaker 1>That's English.</v>

57
00:01:55.981 --> 00:01:57.750
<v Speaker 1>Common law is exactly like that,</v>

58
00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.201
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

59
00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:02.940
<v Speaker 1>It's single decisions that are predicated on principles that are then then</v>

60
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.650
<v Speaker 1>articulated and made into the body of law.</v>

61
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.070
<v Speaker 1>The body of law is something you act out.</v>

62
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.290
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's a body of law.</v>

63
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.610
<v Speaker 1>If you're a good citizen,</v>

64
00:02:11.611 --> 00:02:15.330
<v Speaker 1>you act out the body of law and the body of law has principles.</v>

65
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:16.171
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

66
00:02:16.171 --> 00:02:17.160
<v Speaker 1>so the question is,</v>

67
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.590
<v Speaker 1>there's principles that guide our behavior.</v>

68
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.450
<v Speaker 1>What are those principles?</v>

69
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.871
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

70
00:02:21.871 --> 00:02:22.710
<v Speaker 1>I think when you,</v>

71
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.640
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

72
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.450
<v Speaker 1>if you want the initial answer of what the Ark Archaic is,</v>

73
00:02:27.451 --> 00:02:29.130
<v Speaker 1>real lights meant by God,</v>

74
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.380
<v Speaker 1>that's something like what they meant.</v>

75
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.831
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

76
00:02:31.831 --> 00:02:33.570
<v Speaker 1>it's not a good enough explanation.</v>

77
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.910
<v Speaker 1>But imagine that you,</v>

78
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.043
<v Speaker 1>that you have,</v>

79
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.230
<v Speaker 1>that you're a chimpanzee and you have a powerful,</v>

80
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

81
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

82
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.940
<v Speaker 1>dominant figure at the pinnacle of your society,</v>

83
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.830
<v Speaker 1>that that represents power.</v>

84
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:47.101
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

85
00:02:47.101 --> 00:02:51.120
<v Speaker 1>more than that because it's not sheer physical prowess that keeps a chimp at the</v>

86
00:02:51.121 --> 00:02:52.050
<v Speaker 1>top of the hierarchy.</v>

87
00:02:52.051 --> 00:02:53.580
<v Speaker 1>It's much more complicated than that.</v>

88
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.511
<v Speaker 1>But you could say,</v>

89
00:02:54.511 --> 00:02:54.661
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

90
00:02:54.661 --> 00:02:55.230
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

91
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.650
<v Speaker 1>there's a principle that the dominant person manifests.</v>

92
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:01.301
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>

93
00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:02.134
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

94
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.660
<v Speaker 1>that principle shines forth even more brightly.</v>

95
00:03:04.661 --> 00:03:07.510
<v Speaker 1>If you know 10 people who are dominant,</v>

96
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:08.493
<v Speaker 1>powerful,</v>

97
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.980
<v Speaker 1>and you can extract out what dominance means from that,</v>

98
00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:14.020
<v Speaker 1>you can extract out what power means from that.</v>

99
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.920
<v Speaker 1>And then you can divorce the concept from the people.</v>

100
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.050
<v Speaker 1>And we had to do that at some point because we can say power in a human context</v>

101
00:03:23.051 --> 00:03:24.490
<v Speaker 1>and we can imagine what that means.</v>

102
00:03:24.491 --> 00:03:28.540
<v Speaker 1>But it's divorced from any specific manifestation of power.</v>

103
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.781
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

104
00:03:28.781 --> 00:03:30.220
<v Speaker 1>how the hell did we do that?</v>

105
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.580
<v Speaker 1>Like that's so complicated when if you're a chimp,</v>

106
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.280
<v Speaker 1>the power is in another chimp.</v>

107
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.260
<v Speaker 1>It's not some damn abstraction.</v>

108
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.251
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

109
00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:39.730
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>

110
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.110
<v Speaker 1>so the question is think,</v>

111
00:03:41.111 --> 00:03:41.700
<v Speaker 1>think about it.</v>

112
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:42.970
<v Speaker 1>We're in these hierarchies,</v>

113
00:03:42.971 --> 00:03:44.590
<v Speaker 1>many of them across centuries.</v>

114
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.260
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to figure out what the guiding principle is.</v>

115
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.850
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to extract out the core of the guiding principle and we turned that</v>

116
00:03:51.851 --> 00:03:54.930
<v Speaker 1>into a representation of a pattern of Ba.</v>

117
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

118
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.710
<v Speaker 1>it's something like that.</v>

119
00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:57.820
<v Speaker 1>That's God.</v>

120
00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.420
<v Speaker 1>It's an abstracted,</v>

121
00:03:59.421 --> 00:04:01.270
<v Speaker 1>the ideal and it's,</v>

122
00:04:01.271 --> 00:04:01.600
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

123
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.940
<v Speaker 1>it's put in personified form.</v>

124
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.430
<v Speaker 1>It manifests itself in persona find form.</v>

125
00:04:06.431 --> 00:04:08.950
<v Speaker 1>But that's okay because what we're trying to get at is the,</v>

126
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.061
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>

127
00:04:10.061 --> 00:04:14.230
<v Speaker 1>the essence of what it means to be a properly functioning and properly,</v>

128
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.150
<v Speaker 1>properly functioning properly social and property competent individual.</v>

129
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.770
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to figure out what that means.</v>

130
00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.930
<v Speaker 1>You needed an embodiment,</v>

131
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.960
<v Speaker 1>you needed ideal that's abstract and then you could act out that would enable</v>

132
00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:30.220
<v Speaker 1>you to understand what that means.</v>

133
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.080
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we've been driving out.</v>

134
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.000
<v Speaker 1>So that's the first hypothesis.</v>

135
00:04:34.001 --> 00:04:34.840
<v Speaker 1>In some sense,</v>

136
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go over some of the,</v>

137
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.830
<v Speaker 1>some of the attributes of this abstract,</v>

138
00:04:38.831 --> 00:04:40.810
<v Speaker 1>that ideal that we've formalized as God.</v>

139
00:04:40.811 --> 00:04:45.811
<v Speaker 1>But that's the first sort of hypothesis is that a philosophical or moral ideal</v>

140
00:04:46.571 --> 00:04:51.040
<v Speaker 1>manifests itself first as a concrete pattern of behavior that's characteristic</v>

141
00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:52.570
<v Speaker 1>of a single individual.</v>

142
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.700
<v Speaker 1>And then it's a set of individuals and then it's an abstraction from that set.</v>

143
00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:59.530
<v Speaker 1>And then you have the abstraction.</v>

144
00:04:59.531 --> 00:05:00.610
<v Speaker 1>It's so important.</v>

145
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.320
<v Speaker 1>So here's a political implication.</v>

146
00:05:02.321 --> 00:05:03.154
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

147
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.980
<v Speaker 1>one of the debates we might say between early Christianity and the late Roman</v>

148
00:05:17.461 --> 00:05:22.461
<v Speaker 1>empire was whether or not an emperor could be God literally right to be deified,</v>

149
00:05:23.821 --> 00:05:26.460
<v Speaker 1>to put enough to be put in a temple.</v>

150
00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.600
<v Speaker 1>And you can see why that might happen because that's someone at the pinnacle of</v>

151
00:05:30.601 --> 00:05:34.380
<v Speaker 1>a very steep hierarchy has a tremendous amount of power and influence.</v>

152
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.800
<v Speaker 1>But the Christian response to that was never confuse the specific sovereign with</v>

153
00:05:41.671 --> 00:05:45.150
<v Speaker 1>the principle of sovereignty itself.</v>

154
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:46.960
<v Speaker 1>It's brilliant to see,</v>

155
00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:50.460
<v Speaker 1>see how difficult it is to come up with an idea like that so that even the</v>

156
00:05:50.461 --> 00:05:54.630
<v Speaker 1>person who has the power is actually subordinate to something else subordinate</v>

157
00:05:54.631 --> 00:05:55.500
<v Speaker 1>to Ah,</v>

158
00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.000
<v Speaker 1>let's call it a divine,</v>

159
00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:58.790
<v Speaker 1>for lack of a better word,</v>

160
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.110
<v Speaker 1>so that even the king himself is subordinate to the principal.</v>

161
00:06:03.111 --> 00:06:06.470
<v Speaker 1>And we still believe that because we believe that our president or prime</v>

162
00:06:06.471 --> 00:06:09.290
<v Speaker 1>minister is subordinate to the damn law,</v>

163
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.820
<v Speaker 1>whatever the body of law,</v>

164
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:11.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

165
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.320
<v Speaker 1>There's a principle inside that that even the leader is subordinate to.</v>

166
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.191
<v Speaker 1>And without that,</v>

167
00:06:16.191 --> 00:06:19.070
<v Speaker 1>you could argue you can't even have a civilized society because your,</v>

168
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.940
<v Speaker 1>your leader immediately turns into something that's transcendent and all</v>

169
00:06:22.941 --> 00:06:23.774
<v Speaker 1>powerful.</v>

170
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:24.291
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>

171
00:06:24.291 --> 00:06:27.260
<v Speaker 1>that's certainly what happened in the Soviet Union and what happened in Mao's</v>

172
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.680
<v Speaker 1>China and what happened in Nazi Germany because there was nothing for the</v>

173
00:06:30.681 --> 00:06:33.170
<v Speaker 1>powerful to subordinate themselves to,</v>

174
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.870
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to be subordinate to God.</v>

175
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.220
<v Speaker 1>So what does that mean?</v>

176
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.320
<v Speaker 1>While we're going to tear that idea apart,</v>

177
00:06:39.321 --> 00:06:42.080
<v Speaker 1>but partly what it means is that you're subordinate,</v>

178
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.500
<v Speaker 1>even if you're sovereign to the principle of sovereignty itself.</v>

179
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:46.880
<v Speaker 1>And then the question is,</v>

180
00:06:46.881 --> 00:06:49.100
<v Speaker 1>what the hell is the principle of sovereignty?</v>

181
00:06:49.101 --> 00:06:52.850
<v Speaker 1>And I could say we have been working that out for a very long period of time.</v>
