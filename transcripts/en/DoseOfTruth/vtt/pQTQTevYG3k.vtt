1
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.160
<v Speaker 1>Happening at Johns Hopkins Hospital with the Psilocybin experimenters because</v>

2
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.510
<v Speaker 1>one of the most recent things they showed was that if you take people dying of</v>

3
00:00:17.511 --> 00:00:21.890
<v Speaker 1>cancer and you'd give them cell assignment and they have a mystical experience,</v>

4
00:00:21.891 --> 00:00:24.800
<v Speaker 1>which is something like an experience of the Kingdom of God on earth,</v>

5
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.650
<v Speaker 1>but also eternally at the same time that they lose their fear of death or did</v>

6
00:00:29.651 --> 00:00:29.730
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

7
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.190
<v Speaker 1>at least it's much modified it,</v>

8
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.170
<v Speaker 1>that's a hell of a finding.</v>

10
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.033
<v Speaker 1>That's really,</v>

11
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.963
<v Speaker 1>you can't just,</v>

12
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.860
<v Speaker 1>you can't just walk away from that easily because that's a hell of a thing to</v>

13
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:39.703
<v Speaker 1>treat.</v>

14
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.770
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

15
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.050
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

16
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.720
<v Speaker 2>I have a chapter on that then in heavens on earth,</v>

17
00:00:43.721 --> 00:00:45.220
<v Speaker 2>on near death experiences.</v>

18
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.073
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

19
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.130
<v Speaker 2>it's so,</v>

20
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.460
<v Speaker 2>but we're talking about two different things.</v>

21
00:00:48.461 --> 00:00:49.170
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

22
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.561
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

23
00:00:49.561 --> 00:00:54.561
<v Speaker 2>the transitioning from life to death in the most pain free or anxiety reduced</v>

24
00:00:56.801 --> 00:00:57.501
<v Speaker 2>state is,</v>

25
00:00:57.501 --> 00:00:58.000
<v Speaker 2>is more,</v>

26
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.833
<v Speaker 2>is progress.</v>

27
00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:59.171
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

28
00:00:59.171 --> 00:00:59.381
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

29
00:00:59.381 --> 00:01:00.220
<v Speaker 2>medical progress,</v>

30
00:01:00.221 --> 00:01:03.130
<v Speaker 2>psychological progress or whatever and I'm all for,</v>

31
00:01:03.131 --> 00:01:03.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

32
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.680
<v Speaker 2>is psilocybin does it or whatever.</v>

33
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:06.673
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

34
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.541
<v Speaker 2>then great,</v>

35
00:01:07.541 --> 00:01:08.374
<v Speaker 2>we should do that.</v>

36
00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.920
<v Speaker 2>But there's a lot of people that claim more than that,</v>

37
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.740
<v Speaker 2>that this is opening the doors of perception into another world.</v>

38
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.020
<v Speaker 2>It's actually out there and that those of us had not taken acid.</v>

39
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.760
<v Speaker 2>We just simply can't know.</v>

40
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:23.490
<v Speaker 2>So now we,</v>

41
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.600
<v Speaker 2>now we get at this question of truth.</v>

42
00:01:25.601 --> 00:01:26.434
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

43
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.340
<v Speaker 2>one of my columns and scientific American and I recently wrote called,</v>

44
00:01:30.341 --> 00:01:31.240
<v Speaker 2>what is truth anyway?</v>

45
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:31.961
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

46
00:01:31.961 --> 00:01:34.150
<v Speaker 2>when I say like I prefer dark,</v>

47
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.580
<v Speaker 2>dark chocolate and you prefer milk chocolate,</v>

48
00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:37.743
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

49
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.150
<v Speaker 2>there's no truth that is to be discovered.</v>

50
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.380
<v Speaker 2>Years is true for you.</v>

51
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.191
<v Speaker 2>Mine's Poop for me.</v>

52
00:01:42.191 --> 00:01:45.370
<v Speaker 2>Or I say stairway to heaven as the greatest rock song of all time.</v>

53
00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:45.780
<v Speaker 2>And you say,</v>

54
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.941
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

55
00:01:45.941 --> 00:01:46.120
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

56
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.190
<v Speaker 2>Freebird is better than stairway to heaven.</v>

57
00:01:48.191 --> 00:01:49.540
<v Speaker 2>And we argue about that,</v>

58
00:01:49.541 --> 00:01:50.260
<v Speaker 2>but there's no,</v>

59
00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.580
<v Speaker 2>there's no experiment we're going to run.</v>

60
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.820
<v Speaker 2>And so as we start to move along these lines,</v>

61
00:01:54.821 --> 00:01:57.640
<v Speaker 2>like when Deepak Chopra tells me meditation works,</v>

62
00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.721
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

63
00:01:58.721 --> 00:02:02.110
<v Speaker 2>so if it works for you or it doesn't work for me,</v>

64
00:02:02.111 --> 00:02:02.291
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

65
00:02:02.291 --> 00:02:04.770
<v Speaker 2>those are still in that state of internal truths.</v>

66
00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.760
<v Speaker 2>But what we want to know in science,</v>

67
00:02:06.761 --> 00:02:08.230
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't work for everybody.</v>

68
00:02:08.231 --> 00:02:08.381
<v Speaker 2>Or,</v>

69
00:02:08.381 --> 00:02:08.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

70
00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.590
<v Speaker 2>67% of people that do an hour of meditation a day under these conditions have</v>

71
00:02:13.631 --> 00:02:16.810
<v Speaker 2>reduced stress hormones and blood pressure.</v>

72
00:02:16.811 --> 00:02:21.280
<v Speaker 2>And so in some measurable way that's different than just an internal state.</v>

73
00:02:21.281 --> 00:02:23.260
<v Speaker 2>So when we're talking about,</v>

74
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.393
<v Speaker 2>again just to,</v>

75
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

76
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.601
<v Speaker 2>working on,</v>

77
00:02:25.601 --> 00:02:25.930
<v Speaker 2>towards,</v>

78
00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.700
<v Speaker 2>towards striving to better ourselves or,</v>

79
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.350
<v Speaker 2>or some kind of heaven,</v>

80
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.273
<v Speaker 2>if you mean just,</v>

81
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:31.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

82
00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.820
<v Speaker 2>metaphorically so that I can better myself,</v>

83
00:02:33.821 --> 00:02:37.970
<v Speaker 2>that's different than there was an actual place you can go to a,</v>

84
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.150
<v Speaker 2>that's going to be there after we die.</v>

85
00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.600
<v Speaker 2>And so I think this is where scientists go.</v>

86
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.830
<v Speaker 1>You also started messing about with the idea of place in a way that that's the</v>

87
00:02:49.831 --> 00:02:52.410
<v Speaker 1>problem with having discussions about fundamental realities.</v>

88
00:02:52.411 --> 00:02:52.951
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

89
00:02:52.951 --> 00:02:56.630
<v Speaker 1>when you said another thing that Christ said was that the Kingdom of Heaven is</v>

90
00:02:56.631 --> 00:02:57.361
<v Speaker 1>spread upon earth,</v>

91
00:02:57.361 --> 00:02:58.470
<v Speaker 1>but men do not see it.</v>

92
00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.620
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

93
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

94
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.151
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

95
00:03:00.151 --> 00:03:00.611
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

96
00:03:00.611 --> 00:03:03.970
<v Speaker 1>that's something that's akin to the idea of that Kingdom of God is within you.</v>

97
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.870
<v Speaker 1>Although it's,</v>

98
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.820
<v Speaker 1>it's a strange twist on it because it also adds an element of externalities or</v>

99
00:03:09.821 --> 00:03:10.780
<v Speaker 1>physicality to it.</v>

100
00:03:10.781 --> 00:03:12.610
<v Speaker 1>And an element of immediacy,</v>

101
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.770
<v Speaker 1>not something that's forestalled into the future.</v>

102
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.060
<v Speaker 1>But I wonder,</v>

103
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.691
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

104
00:03:16.691 --> 00:03:18.790
<v Speaker 1>in my wilder moments of speculation,</v>

105
00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.590
<v Speaker 1>I have this notion that if things stack up properly,</v>

106
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.970
<v Speaker 1>so imagine that you're immersed in a very deeply meaningful experience and,</v>

107
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.050
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

108
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.280
<v Speaker 1>it's operating.</v>

109
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.970
<v Speaker 1>It's indicating that harmony has been established between multiple levels of</v>

110
00:03:33.971 --> 00:03:35.110
<v Speaker 1>being simultaneously.</v>

111
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.550
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that can,</v>

112
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.350
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that can put you in a place that's profound enough or deep enough so</v>

113
00:03:41.351 --> 00:03:45.040
<v Speaker 1>that the structure of time and space itself starts to warp around that.</v>

114
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:46.443
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

115
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.680
<v Speaker 1>I know that that's a,</v>

116
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.990
<v Speaker 1>I can't formulate it well,</v>

117
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.330
<v Speaker 1>but there's,</v>

118
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.180
<v Speaker 1>there's something,</v>

119
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.120
<v Speaker 1>there's something about it that seems to me to be correct about that,</v>

120
00:03:55.121 --> 00:03:58.090
<v Speaker 1>because people have intimations of a murder of a mortality,</v>

121
00:03:58.091 --> 00:03:59.650
<v Speaker 1>and they have intimations of,</v>

122
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.400
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

123
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.770
<v Speaker 1>of heavenly and hellish a boats as well.</v>

124
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:03.753
<v Speaker 1>And they're not,</v>

125
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:04.803
<v Speaker 1>they're not,</v>

126
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.210
<v Speaker 1>they're not the simple kind of rational,</v>

127
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:08.381
<v Speaker 1>even rational,</v>

128
00:04:08.381 --> 00:04:11.530
<v Speaker 1>fundamentalist beliefs that often people talk about when they're discussing</v>

129
00:04:11.531 --> 00:04:12.364
<v Speaker 1>religious belief.</v>

130
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.180
<v Speaker 1>They're more reflected in direct experience and it's not easy to make sense of</v>

131
00:04:16.181 --> 00:04:16.360
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
