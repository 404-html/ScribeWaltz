1
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:06.851
<v Speaker 1>Here's why.</v>

2
00:00:06.851 --> 00:00:09.730
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk to you about the brain a little bit because if you make the</v>

3
00:00:09.731 --> 00:00:10.570
<v Speaker 1>radical case,</v>

4
00:00:10.571 --> 00:00:15.280
<v Speaker 1>let's say that these are actually the categories of reality and we're going to</v>

5
00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:15.461
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

6
00:00:15.461 --> 00:00:18.310
<v Speaker 1>well reality is what selects for this for the sake of,</v>

7
00:00:18.311 --> 00:00:18.791
<v Speaker 1>for this,</v>

8
00:00:18.791 --> 00:00:19.870
<v Speaker 1>for the sake of argument.</v>

9
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.800
<v Speaker 1>Then the then are our neurological structures and our physical structure should</v>

10
00:00:25.841 --> 00:00:27.850
<v Speaker 1>be adapted to that reality.</v>

11
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:28.713
<v Speaker 1>It's it's,</v>

12
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:29.500
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

13
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.300
<v Speaker 1>it's a necessary conclusion from that.</v>

14
00:00:31.301 --> 00:00:32.320
<v Speaker 1>So then the question is,</v>

15
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.460
<v Speaker 1>well are they,</v>

16
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.900
<v Speaker 1>and as far as I can tell,</v>

17
00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:36.340
<v Speaker 1>the answer to that is yes,</v>

18
00:00:36.341 --> 00:00:37.300
<v Speaker 1>and so we'll,</v>

19
00:00:37.301 --> 00:00:38.320
<v Speaker 1>we'll go through the,</v>

20
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.160
<v Speaker 1>the neuropsychological evidence quite rapidly.</v>

21
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.070
<v Speaker 1>The first bit of evidence is that you have two hemispheres.</v>

22
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.710
<v Speaker 1>Why one deals with the unknown and the other deals with the known that sale</v>

23
00:00:50.711 --> 00:00:51.670
<v Speaker 1>Conan Goldberg.</v>

24
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:52.060
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

25
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.120
<v Speaker 1>that's hypothesized completely independently of any of this underlying</v>

26
00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:56.350
<v Speaker 1>mythological substructure,</v>

27
00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.850
<v Speaker 1>which is really important thing to note because if you're trying to determine</v>

28
00:01:00.851 --> 00:01:02.650
<v Speaker 1>whether or not something is true,</v>

29
00:01:02.651 --> 00:01:03.430
<v Speaker 1>valid,</v>

30
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.960
<v Speaker 1>if the constructs upon which you base your thinking are valid and true,</v>

31
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.640
<v Speaker 1>there's rules for doing that.</v>

32
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.180
<v Speaker 1>And one of the rules is you have to be able to detect the existence of the</v>

33
00:01:13.181 --> 00:01:15.640
<v Speaker 1>categories using multiple methods of,</v>

34
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.863
<v Speaker 1>of uh,</v>

35
00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:17.440
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

36
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.610
<v Speaker 1>of what,</v>

37
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.810
<v Speaker 1>using multiple methods.</v>

38
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.390
<v Speaker 1>It's the multi-method multitrack matrix.</v>

39
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.470
<v Speaker 1>Technically speaking,</v>

40
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.450
<v Speaker 1>it was established as a technique by two psychologists named crone back C,</v>

41
00:01:28.451 --> 00:01:28.691
<v Speaker 1>R,</v>

42
00:01:28.691 --> 00:01:29.141
<v Speaker 1>O n,</v>

43
00:01:29.141 --> 00:01:29.351
<v Speaker 1>B,</v>

44
00:01:29.351 --> 00:01:29.531
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

45
00:01:29.531 --> 00:01:30.970
<v Speaker 1>c h and meal M,</v>

46
00:01:30.971 --> 00:01:32.140
<v Speaker 1>e e h l,</v>

47
00:01:32.141 --> 00:01:34.990
<v Speaker 1>Paul Meehl back in the 1950s when psychologists,</v>

48
00:01:34.991 --> 00:01:38.230
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to figure out how do you determine if something actually has an</v>

49
00:01:38.231 --> 00:01:41.650
<v Speaker 1>existence like anger or anxiety as something that you could study</v>

50
00:01:41.651 --> 00:01:42.484
<v Speaker 1>scientifically.</v>

51
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.361
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is,</v>

52
00:01:43.361 --> 00:01:47.320
<v Speaker 1>well you have to be able to measure it multiple ways and all those measurements</v>

53
00:01:47.321 --> 00:01:49.540
<v Speaker 1>have to read the same way.</v>

54
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:50.770
<v Speaker 1>And then the question is,</v>

55
00:01:50.771 --> 00:01:50.921
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

56
00:01:50.921 --> 00:01:53.470
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean by multiple ways?</v>

57
00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.880
<v Speaker 1>Cause his sight and vision and his sight and hearing different while somewhat</v>

58
00:01:57.881 --> 00:01:58.960
<v Speaker 1>and somewhat the same,</v>

59
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.400
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

60
00:02:00.401 --> 00:02:00.760
<v Speaker 1>you do,</v>

61
00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.890
<v Speaker 1>you make them as different as you can manage,</v>

62
00:02:02.891 --> 00:02:03.340
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

63
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.190
<v Speaker 1>And our sensory systems are quite different smell,</v>

64
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.150
<v Speaker 1>molecular signature sound is auditory are,</v>

65
00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.541
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

66
00:02:10.541 --> 00:02:11.440
<v Speaker 1>auditory pressure.</v>

67
00:02:11.441 --> 00:02:15.370
<v Speaker 1>You need a gas around you or some liquid in order for that to occur.</v>

68
00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:16.630
<v Speaker 1>Site uses light.</v>

69
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.841
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

70
00:02:16.841 --> 00:02:17.051
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

71
00:02:17.051 --> 00:02:20.890
<v Speaker 1>we're using different inputs that converge and allow us to say,</v>

72
00:02:20.891 --> 00:02:21.041
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

73
00:02:21.041 --> 00:02:23.890
<v Speaker 1>if we get convergent information across these multiple measurements,</v>

74
00:02:23.891 --> 00:02:26.710
<v Speaker 1>then we'll assume that the thing we're perceiving as real,</v>

75
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.970
<v Speaker 1>we even extend that in science because we say if you take your multiple</v>

76
00:02:30.971 --> 00:02:32.920
<v Speaker 1>measurement system and you take your multiple,</v>

77
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.480
<v Speaker 1>multiple measurement system and then you compare them will only allow what's</v>

78
00:02:37.481 --> 00:02:40.210
<v Speaker 1>constant across both those comparisons to be real.</v>

79
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.980
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the multi-method multi trade matrix process essentially.</v>

80
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.120
<v Speaker 1>And my sense is that,</v>

81
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.751
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>

82
00:02:48.751 --> 00:02:51.130
<v Speaker 1>I think that the pattern that I'm describing to you,</v>

83
00:02:51.131 --> 00:02:53.290
<v Speaker 1>it's manifested itself evolutionarily.</v>

84
00:02:53.291 --> 00:02:54.820
<v Speaker 1>It manifest itself at the neural,</v>

85
00:02:54.821 --> 00:02:59.050
<v Speaker 1>in the learner logical space and it manifest itself in the conceptual space and</v>

86
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.850
<v Speaker 1>probability of all three of those things happening at the same time without</v>

87
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:05.170
<v Speaker 1>there being something valid.</v>

88
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.170
<v Speaker 1>There is lessons with each level of interpretation you manage to stack on top of</v>

89
00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:11.374
<v Speaker 1>one another.</v>

90
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.311
<v Speaker 1>So that's the,</v>

91
00:03:12.311 --> 00:03:13.150
<v Speaker 1>that's the method.</v>

92
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

93
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.220
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

94
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.310
<v Speaker 1>well let's think about the brain a little bit and I'll,</v>

95
00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.680
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you a little bit about how the brain works and,</v>

96
00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.861
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

97
00:03:23.861 --> 00:03:26.230
<v Speaker 1>a lot of this stuff I'm telling you right now is quite old.</v>

98
00:03:26.231 --> 00:03:26.591
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>

99
00:03:26.591 --> 00:03:28.270
<v Speaker 1>Most of it was worked out in the 19,</v>

100
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.650
<v Speaker 1>in the 1980s but it's been remarkably stable as far as I can tell.</v>

101
00:03:32.651 --> 00:03:35.830
<v Speaker 1>In some sense we're filling in the details and not in every sense,</v>

102
00:03:35.831 --> 00:03:38.140
<v Speaker 1>but in some sense we're filling in the details.</v>

103
00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:38.381
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

104
00:03:38.381 --> 00:03:39.100
<v Speaker 1>So you take,</v>

105
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.910
<v Speaker 1>this is from Alexander Luria who was the greatest,</v>

106
00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.340
<v Speaker 1>perhaps the greatest neuropsychologist who ever lived.</v>

107
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:47.230
<v Speaker 1>He was a Russian,</v>

108
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

109
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:48.311
<v Speaker 1>more work,</v>

110
00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:49.710
<v Speaker 1>mostly after the Second World War,</v>

111
00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.370
<v Speaker 1>mostly on people who had brain damage.</v>

112
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.400
<v Speaker 1>And he was interested in trying to outline the,</v>

113
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.473
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

114
00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.190
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

115
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.023
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

116
00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.920
<v Speaker 1>the overarching picture of brain function.</v>

117
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.130
<v Speaker 1>And so he did that partly by looking at its function,</v>

118
00:04:03.131 --> 00:04:05.140
<v Speaker 1>but also partly by looking at its structure,</v>

119
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.960
<v Speaker 1>trying to get both of those things working simultaneously.</v>

120
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.590
<v Speaker 1>And so we'll go through a brief picture of how the brain works.</v>

121
00:04:11.591 --> 00:04:12.820
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the ways of,</v>

122
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:14.890
<v Speaker 1>so you can,</v>

123
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.070
<v Speaker 1>you can look at the brain from front to back and you can divided roughly into</v>

124
00:04:18.071 --> 00:04:21.430
<v Speaker 1>two sections and one section has to do with sensory processing and that's</v>

125
00:04:21.431 --> 00:04:25.570
<v Speaker 1>roughly the back half and one section has to do with motor output.</v>

126
00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.980
<v Speaker 1>Now those things aren't,</v>

127
00:04:26.981 --> 00:04:30.510
<v Speaker 1>has clearly differentiated as you might think because you,</v>

128
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.610
<v Speaker 1>there's very little sensation without motor output.</v>

129
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:34.653
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the,</v>

130
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:35.880
<v Speaker 1>the pot,</v>

131
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.900
<v Speaker 1>the closest to an exception is smell,</v>

132
00:04:37.901 --> 00:04:38.321
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

133
00:04:38.321 --> 00:04:40.000
<v Speaker 1>But you at least have to breathe in,</v>

134
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.661
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

135
00:04:40.661 --> 00:04:43.270
<v Speaker 1>and when an animal is actively searching out a scent trail,</v>

136
00:04:43.271 --> 00:04:43.990
<v Speaker 1>it's breathing in.</v>

137
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.281
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

138
00:04:44.281 --> 00:04:47.890
<v Speaker 1>it's using its motor output constantly to modify the sensory stream.</v>

139
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.020
<v Speaker 1>It's really difficult to dissociate the two.</v>

140
00:04:50.021 --> 00:04:51.550
<v Speaker 1>And when you're looking at something,</v>

141
00:04:51.551 --> 00:04:51.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

142
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.960
<v Speaker 1>it kind of feels to you like you're a passive recipient of sense data,</v>

143
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.400
<v Speaker 1>but you're no such thing.</v>

144
00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:58.400
<v Speaker 1>Your eyes are,</v>

145
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.170
<v Speaker 1>are moving back and forth in multiple ways all the time,</v>

146
00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.050
<v Speaker 1>including the ways that you can control voluntarily.</v>

147
00:05:05.051 --> 00:05:08.380
<v Speaker 1>So there's multiple involuntary systems that are moving your eyes in multiple</v>

148
00:05:08.381 --> 00:05:08.950
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>

149
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.050
<v Speaker 1>And really what you're doing is feeling the,</v>

150
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.000
<v Speaker 1>the array of,</v>

151
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.230
<v Speaker 1>of electromagnetic,</v>

152
00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.420
<v Speaker 1>of the electromagnetic spectrum with your eyes.</v>

153
00:05:16.421 --> 00:05:19.930
<v Speaker 1>You're feeling it and you're actively exploring if you're not a passive</v>

154
00:05:19.931 --> 00:05:20.980
<v Speaker 1>recipient at all.</v>

155
00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.530
<v Speaker 1>So even in sensation,</v>

156
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.420
<v Speaker 1>you can't purely pull sensation out for motor processing and say,</v>

157
00:05:28.421 --> 00:05:33.421
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting untrammeled unbiased census data because you can't look at something</v>

158
00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.800
<v Speaker 1>without focusing and you can't focus without wanting to look at something.</v>

159
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.340
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

160
00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.590
<v Speaker 1>you can't just lie there with you while you could with your eyes have cross.</v>

161
00:05:42.591 --> 00:05:43.540
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

162
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:44.500
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of like,</v>

163
00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:49.900
<v Speaker 1>imagine you dropped a video recorder from an airplane and it just spun around in</v>

164
00:05:49.901 --> 00:05:50.920
<v Speaker 1>an unfocused manner.</v>

165
00:05:50.921 --> 00:05:53.620
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the world sampled randomly.</v>

166
00:05:53.621 --> 00:05:53.930
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

167
00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:54.421
<v Speaker 1>why do you,</v>

168
00:05:54.421 --> 00:05:55.480
<v Speaker 1>what are you gonna do with that?</v>

169
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:56.343
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

170
00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.861
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

171
00:05:56.861 --> 00:05:57.140
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

172
00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.730
<v Speaker 1>you're concentrating on the,</v>

173
00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:59.653
<v Speaker 1>on the,</v>

174
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:04.080
<v Speaker 1>on the auditory stream constantly and segregating out some things and</v>

175
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.210
<v Speaker 1>suppressing others.</v>

176
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:06.950
<v Speaker 1>Like if you listen in the classroom,</v>

177
00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:10.703
<v Speaker 2>you can hear</v>

178
00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:16.180
<v Speaker 1>probably four or five different types of mechanical noise going on at the same</v>

179
00:06:16.181 --> 00:06:17.014
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

180
00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.320
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time in the classroom that's silent.</v>

181
00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.500
<v Speaker 1>You don't hear it like you don't hear your fridge except when it turns on or</v>

182
00:06:23.501 --> 00:06:23.831
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

183
00:06:23.831 --> 00:06:28.150
<v Speaker 1>Right is zero that out and so you're very selective in your perception,</v>

184
00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:33.810
<v Speaker 1>so you can't really technically separate out motor output from sensory input and</v>

185
00:06:33.821 --> 00:06:38.200
<v Speaker 1>that's really useful to know because it destroys the idea that you're just a</v>

186
00:06:38.201 --> 00:06:38.710
<v Speaker 1>path.</v>

187
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.160
<v Speaker 1>You know that there's that world of sensation out there that's imprinting itself</v>

188
00:06:42.161 --> 00:06:44.740
<v Speaker 1>on you and that's how you get your information,</v>

189
00:06:44.741 --> 00:06:45.640
<v Speaker 1>which is really the,</v>

190
00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:50.500
<v Speaker 1>that's the fundamental presupposition of the empiricists of the raw empiricists.</v>

191
00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.450
<v Speaker 1>There's a world of sense data out there.</v>

192
00:06:52.451 --> 00:06:54.730
<v Speaker 1>You sample it randomly and that's what informs you.</v>

193
00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:55.090
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

194
00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:55.900
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

195
00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:00.640
<v Speaker 1>except that you're always an active harvest or of the information so you can't</v>

196
00:07:00.641 --> 00:07:02.830
<v Speaker 1>get rid of the interpretive structure a priority.</v>

197
00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:04.570
<v Speaker 1>That was a manual count by the way,</v>

198
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.480
<v Speaker 1>who first established out in his critique of pure reason.</v>

199
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:12.160
<v Speaker 1>You can't get away from the fact that you're actively harvesting the data so you</v>

200
00:07:12.161 --> 00:07:12.491
<v Speaker 1>can say,</v>

201
00:07:12.491 --> 00:07:12.641
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

202
00:07:12.641 --> 00:07:14.140
<v Speaker 1>where does human structure come from?</v>

203
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.720
<v Speaker 1>The sense data that's sort of the blank slate idea.</v>

204
00:07:16.721 --> 00:07:21.550
<v Speaker 1>It's like no wrong because a blank slate cannot process information.</v>

205
00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.130
<v Speaker 1>You're actively engaged right at the beginning.</v>

206
00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:27.280
<v Speaker 1>So that's another example of the knower and the unknown.</v>

207
00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:28.653
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

208
00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:33.690
<v Speaker 1>working in a cyclical manner because you interact with something you divided up</v>

209
00:07:33.971 --> 00:07:35.860
<v Speaker 1>into you,</v>

210
00:07:35.861 --> 00:07:39.670
<v Speaker 1>you and the world roughly speaking and I mean you really make it that way cause</v>

211
00:07:39.671 --> 00:07:42.940
<v Speaker 1>you build yourself out of the information and then of course that makes you a</v>

212
00:07:42.941 --> 00:07:46.480
<v Speaker 1>more differentiated processor with a broader range of skills.</v>

213
00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:48.040
<v Speaker 1>Then you interact with the unknown.</v>

214
00:07:48.041 --> 00:07:48.371
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

215
00:07:48.371 --> 00:07:50.140
<v Speaker 1>you gather more information at,</v>

216
00:07:50.141 --> 00:07:51.370
<v Speaker 1>differentiates the world.</v>

217
00:07:51.371 --> 00:07:53.980
<v Speaker 1>It makes you a more differentiated harvester.</v>

218
00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:57.880
<v Speaker 1>And then so it's just continually cycling and that consciousness,</v>

219
00:07:57.881 --> 00:07:58.630
<v Speaker 1>the logos,</v>

220
00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:03.630
<v Speaker 1>the knower is that thing that's doing that harvesting and you can never say it's</v>

221
00:08:03.821 --> 00:08:04.690
<v Speaker 1>not there.</v>

222
00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:08.350
<v Speaker 1>Now what happens is that it's in it's nascent form to begin with,</v>

223
00:08:08.351 --> 00:08:09.400
<v Speaker 1>low resolution,</v>

224
00:08:09.401 --> 00:08:10.300
<v Speaker 1>nascent form,</v>

225
00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.070
<v Speaker 1>low resolution knower,</v>

226
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.410
<v Speaker 1>low resolution category system,</v>

227
00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:15.850
<v Speaker 1>low resolution world.</v>

228
00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:19.870
<v Speaker 1>But that's enough to kickstart it and to start a differentiating.</v>

229
00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:23.200
<v Speaker 1>And that happens as you develop as an individual</v>

230
00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:26.810
<v Speaker 1>because you start out as a single celled organism,</v>

231
00:08:26.811 --> 00:08:28.160
<v Speaker 1>for all intents and purposes,</v>

232
00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:32.000
<v Speaker 1>a very low resolution thing in a very low resolution world.</v>

233
00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:34.190
<v Speaker 1>And that differentiates itself across time.</v>

234
00:08:34.191 --> 00:08:36.710
<v Speaker 1>But exactly the same thing happened over evolutionary time.</v>

235
00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:38.203
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

236
00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:42.080
<v Speaker 1>so there isn't a time when those three elements aren't there.</v>

237
00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.850
<v Speaker 1>For all intents and purposes,</v>

238
00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:44.960
<v Speaker 1>they're always there.</v>

239
00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:45.680
<v Speaker 1>They're permanent.</v>
