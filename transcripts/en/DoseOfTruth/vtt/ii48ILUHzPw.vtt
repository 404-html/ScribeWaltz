1
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:07.670
<v Speaker 1>Your area candidate.</v>

2
00:00:07.671 --> 00:00:09.420
<v Speaker 1>You're in Toronto right now and Justin Trudeau,</v>

3
00:00:09.421 --> 00:00:10.950
<v Speaker 1>he interrupts a woman at a town hall.</v>

4
00:00:10.951 --> 00:00:13.950
<v Speaker 1>She's asking you a question and he didn't like one of the words that she used.</v>

5
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.830
<v Speaker 1>Listen to the sound bite and then we'll get your reaction.</v>

6
00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:18.583
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

7
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.980
<v Speaker 1>So that's why we came here today to ask you to also look into the policies that</v>

8
00:00:24.531 --> 00:00:29.531
<v Speaker 1>religious charitable organizations have in our legislation so that it can also</v>

9
00:00:29.601 --> 00:00:34.601
<v Speaker 1>be changed because maternal love is the love that's going to change the future</v>

10
00:00:34.881 --> 00:00:35.870
<v Speaker 1>of mankind.</v>

11
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.640
<v Speaker 1>So we'd like you to look,</v>

12
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.350
<v Speaker 1>we would like to say people kind,</v>

13
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.080
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily mankind for inclusive.</v>

14
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.861
<v Speaker 1>There we go.</v>

15
00:00:42.861 --> 00:00:43.694
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

16
00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.070
<v Speaker 2>And the crowd roars.</v>

17
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

18
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.040
<v Speaker 2>well it's quite a,</v>

19
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.520
<v Speaker 2>it's quite the performance.</v>

20
00:00:52.521 --> 00:00:53.354
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

21
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm afraid that our prime minister is only capable of running his ideas on a few</v>

22
00:00:58.851 --> 00:01:01.220
<v Speaker 2>very narrow ideological tracks.</v>

23
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.850
<v Speaker 2>We saw the first evidence of that when he put his cabinet together,</v>

24
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.820
<v Speaker 2>he insisted upon making it 50% women,</v>

25
00:01:07.821 --> 00:01:12.800
<v Speaker 2>despite the fact that only about 22% of the elected mps were women.</v>

26
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.060
<v Speaker 2>And it was easier for him to do that than it was for him to screen people for</v>

27
00:01:17.061 --> 00:01:20.900
<v Speaker 2>the sort of competence that would actually be necessary to be cabinet members.</v>

28
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.030
<v Speaker 2>So we've seen a fair bit of this behavior,</v>

29
00:01:23.031 --> 00:01:28.031
<v Speaker 2>but that was the most egregious example I suppose our prime minister's great</v>

30
00:01:28.191 --> 00:01:29.120
<v Speaker 2>example of that.</v>

31
00:01:29.121 --> 00:01:34.121
<v Speaker 2>So back I think it was in 2015 he announced that half of his cabinet was going</v>

32
00:01:34.821 --> 00:01:39.620
<v Speaker 2>to be women because it was 2015 or something like muddle headed virtue</v>

33
00:01:39.621 --> 00:01:40.370
<v Speaker 2>signaling,</v>

34
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.610
<v Speaker 2>signaling excuse for north thinking.</v>

35
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.390
<v Speaker 2>I think only 20% or 25% of the elected mps were female.</v>

36
00:01:48.391 --> 00:01:52.580
<v Speaker 2>So the proper balance on average would it be 25% female,</v>

37
00:01:52.581 --> 00:01:54.110
<v Speaker 2>75% male.</v>

38
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.200
<v Speaker 2>What he should've done was figured out who,</v>

39
00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.310
<v Speaker 2>what all of these would make for a competent cabinet minister because it's</v>

40
00:02:01.311 --> 00:02:05.420
<v Speaker 2>actually quite important to have competent cabinet ministers and then selected</v>

41
00:02:05.421 --> 00:02:09.590
<v Speaker 2>from among his people for nothing other than competence,</v>

42
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.670
<v Speaker 2>but he could virtue signal and then he set up the most important board,</v>

43
00:02:13.671 --> 00:02:18.671
<v Speaker 2>let's say of the entire comp country on a cause I random basis Jesus.</v>

44
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.090
<v Speaker 2>How pathetic.</v>

45
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.690
<v Speaker 2>He should have been pilloried by Canadians for that.</v>

46
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.510
<v Speaker 2>But we're so clued out and,</v>

47
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.920
<v Speaker 2>and also in the situation that you described,</v>

48
00:02:27.921 --> 00:02:29.660
<v Speaker 2>it's like if I say,</v>

49
00:02:29.661 --> 00:02:29.871
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

50
00:02:29.871 --> 00:02:32.780
<v Speaker 2>50% of Trudeau's cabinet shouldn't have been women.</v>

51
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.590
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

52
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.831
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

53
00:02:33.831 --> 00:02:34.910
<v Speaker 2>you're a misogynist.</v>

54
00:02:34.911 --> 00:02:35.810
<v Speaker 2>It's like no,</v>

55
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.050
<v Speaker 2>only 25% of the elected officials were women.</v>

56
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.831
<v Speaker 2>Now you might say,</v>

57
00:02:39.831 --> 00:02:42.700
<v Speaker 2>well it would be better if 50% of the were elected.</v>

58
00:02:42.701 --> 00:02:44.450
<v Speaker 2>It's like maybe it would be better,</v>

59
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:45.680
<v Speaker 2>but it didn't happen.</v>

60
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.690
<v Speaker 2>So you can't,</v>

61
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.180
<v Speaker 2>you can't fix it at the top end.</v>

62
00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.410
<v Speaker 2>It was appalling.</v>

63
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.800
<v Speaker 2>So it's a hard argument to make you because you need to know that there's more</v>

64
00:02:57.441 --> 00:03:01.240
<v Speaker 2>difference within groups then between in order to be able to come up with a</v>

65
00:03:01.241 --> 00:03:02.380
<v Speaker 2>credible argument,</v>

66
00:03:02.381 --> 00:03:03.190
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

67
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.050
<v Speaker 2>And then so yeah,</v>

68
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.200
<v Speaker 2>I think that the Trudeau government is far to the left of where people</v>

69
00:03:08.201 --> 00:03:09.670
<v Speaker 2>originally assumed it would be.</v>

70
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.481
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

71
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:15.481
<v Speaker 2>I think that his decision to put 50% women in the cabinet was an abdication of</v>

72
00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:18.220
<v Speaker 2>responsibility of a magnitude that,</v>

73
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.520
<v Speaker 2>that we haven't seen before in Canadian political history.</v>

74
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.440
<v Speaker 2>Only 26% of the,</v>

75
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.600
<v Speaker 2>of the MPS elected were female.</v>

76
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.260
<v Speaker 2>And that should have been approximately the proportion of cabinet members.</v>

77
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.370
<v Speaker 2>But to say this is 2015 or whatever the hell the year was.</v>

78
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.600
<v Speaker 2>And then to abdicate his responsibility for selecting the most competent people</v>

79
00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:40.900
<v Speaker 2>was an indication of exactly how,</v>

80
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

81
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.461
<v Speaker 2>what would you say,</v>

82
00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:45.100
<v Speaker 2>how suited he is to be prime minister.</v>

83
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.270
<v Speaker 2>And people just didn't make much of an issue of that because of their attempts</v>

84
00:03:49.271 --> 00:03:50.021
<v Speaker 2>to be tolerant.</v>

85
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:51.890
<v Speaker 2>But I think that what he did was re,</v>

86
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.421
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

87
00:03:52.421 --> 00:03:56.470
<v Speaker 2>I thought the fact that he ran to begin with was reprehensible because he ran</v>

88
00:03:56.471 --> 00:04:00.940
<v Speaker 2>entirely on the name brand recognition that he had derived from his father.</v>

89
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.660
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's the mark of someone who's narcissistic.</v>

90
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.970
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't have done that or</v>

91
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.060
<v Speaker 2>very charismatic and attractive and he knows how to behave in public.</v>

92
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.070
<v Speaker 2>And so Andy had a very,</v>

93
00:04:15.071 --> 00:04:16.730
<v Speaker 2>very famous name and,</v>

94
00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:21.440
<v Speaker 2>but I believe that it was immoral of him to run because the,</v>

95
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.640
<v Speaker 2>we're not dynasties democracies aren't dynasties and he hadn't the um,</v>

96
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.201
<v Speaker 2>the CV,</v>

97
00:04:29.201 --> 00:04:29.830
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

98
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.300
<v Speaker 2>the record of success that you would need as an independent individual to</v>

99
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.350
<v Speaker 2>justify himself as a qualified candidate for prime minister.</v>

100
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.120
<v Speaker 2>So I thought that is his candidacy right from the start was ethically flawed</v>

101
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:44.463
<v Speaker 2>then to,</v>

102
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.730
<v Speaker 2>to multiply that error with these,</v>

103
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.833
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

104
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.033
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

105
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

106
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.790
<v Speaker 2>shallow attempts at broadcasting tolerance,</v>

107
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.680
<v Speaker 2>especially at the expense of competence and the capacity to truly evaluate is</v>

108
00:04:59.681 --> 00:05:02.230
<v Speaker 2>just inexcusable.</v>

109
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.310
<v Speaker 2>Inexcusable.</v>

110
00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:04.090
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

111
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:05.650
<v Speaker 2>it's unbelievably widespread.</v>

112
00:05:05.651 --> 00:05:07.510
<v Speaker 2>So I'll give you an example that's very,</v>

113
00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:08.650
<v Speaker 2>that's very similar.</v>

114
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:10.000
<v Speaker 2>Our Prime Minister,</v>

115
00:05:10.001 --> 00:05:14.410
<v Speaker 2>Justin Trudeau announced in 2015 that half the cabinet that he put together</v>

116
00:05:14.411 --> 00:05:15.244
<v Speaker 2>would be women,</v>

117
00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.421
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

118
00:05:16.421 --> 00:05:18.040
<v Speaker 2>The fact that only approximately,</v>

119
00:05:18.041 --> 00:05:21.700
<v Speaker 2>I think it was 20 to 25% of the elected officials were female.</v>

120
00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:27.040
<v Speaker 2>And so what he basically admitted as far as I'm concerned are,</v>

121
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.510
<v Speaker 2>was two things.</v>

122
00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:29.051
<v Speaker 2>Number one,</v>

123
00:05:29.051 --> 00:05:33.970
<v Speaker 2>he was incapable of judging people on their competence because when you put</v>

124
00:05:33.971 --> 00:05:36.130
<v Speaker 2>together something like the cabinet for our country,</v>

125
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.820
<v Speaker 2>what you do is you find the most competent people period because</v>

126
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.520
<v Speaker 2>it's so bizarre that it even has to be said because it actually turns out that</v>

127
00:05:45.521 --> 00:05:50.521
<v Speaker 2>the cabinet is important and so to me all he did was default on his see his</v>

128
00:05:52.361 --> 00:05:56.800
<v Speaker 2>central moral obligation to screen every single one of his members of parliament</v>

129
00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.430
<v Speaker 2>with exceeding care and to pick the most qualified people and his rationale was</v>

130
00:06:01.431 --> 00:06:04.400
<v Speaker 2>that it was 2015 you know,</v>

131
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:09.430
<v Speaker 2>so and we to reduce competence to racial ethnic,</v>

132
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.080
<v Speaker 2>gender identity,</v>

133
00:06:12.081 --> 00:06:15.080
<v Speaker 2>something like that is absolutely appalling.</v>

134
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.270
<v Speaker 2>Move philosophically as well.</v>

135
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:21.830
<v Speaker 2>As far as I'm concerned to assume that diversity is somehow represented by group</v>

136
00:06:21.831 --> 00:06:22.401
<v Speaker 2>membership.</v>

137
00:06:22.401 --> 00:06:23.540
<v Speaker 2>There's no evidence for that.</v>

138
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.540
<v Speaker 2>There's absolutely no scientific evidence for that whatsoever.</v>

139
00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:26.991
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

140
00:06:26.991 --> 00:06:30.050
<v Speaker 2>the scientific evidence suggest quite the contrary,</v>

141
00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.470
<v Speaker 2>which is that there's more variability within groups than there is between</v>

142
00:06:34.471 --> 00:06:35.304
<v Speaker 2>groups,</v>

143
00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.520
<v Speaker 2>which is actually an antidote to the central racist claim.</v>

144
00:06:38.521 --> 00:06:38.761
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

145
00:06:38.761 --> 00:06:40.430
<v Speaker 2>Because the central racist claim is,</v>

146
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.130
<v Speaker 2>there's more difference between groups than there is difference within them.</v>

147
00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:44.971
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

148
00:06:44.971 --> 00:06:45.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

149
00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:46.950
<v Speaker 2>you seen one black person,</v>

150
00:06:46.951 --> 00:06:47.880
<v Speaker 2>you've seen them all.</v>

151
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.260
<v Speaker 3>We lock people who've already done that.</v>

152
00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:50.531
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

153
00:06:50.531 --> 00:06:51.131
<v Speaker 3>that's interesting.</v>

154
00:06:51.131 --> 00:06:53.200
<v Speaker 3>So you're saying it's a necessary transition.</v>

155
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.260
<v Speaker 3>You're saying that something about the life that he ended up saying something</v>

156
00:06:56.261 --> 00:06:56.681
<v Speaker 3>simple.</v>

157
00:06:56.681 --> 00:07:01.120
<v Speaker 3>If you can't make your damn bed quit Wavell black cards at corporations,</v>

158
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:02.380
<v Speaker 3>it's like Jesus.</v>

159
00:07:02.381 --> 00:07:04.060
<v Speaker 3>It's like seriously?</v>

160
00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:04.691
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

161
00:07:04.691 --> 00:07:05.560
<v Speaker 3>what the hell?</v>

162
00:07:05.561 --> 00:07:06.131
<v Speaker 3>What makes you,</v>

163
00:07:06.131 --> 00:07:08.340
<v Speaker 3>you can't get this tiny little part of the world.</v>

164
00:07:08.341 --> 00:07:10.840
<v Speaker 3>It's actually right at your feet functional.</v>

165
00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:11.980
<v Speaker 3>You have contempt for it.</v>

166
00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:15.580
<v Speaker 3>It's just my bedroom seems like grits shoots this caricature of people.</v>

167
00:07:15.581 --> 00:07:15.821
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

168
00:07:15.821 --> 00:07:16.654
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

169
00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:17.980
<v Speaker 3>they're there.</v>

170
00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:18.521
<v Speaker 3>Flip on that is,</v>

171
00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:18.940
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

172
00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.640
<v Speaker 3>why should I waste my time making my bed when we got to deal with his problems</v>

173
00:07:21.641 --> 00:07:22.474
<v Speaker 3>in the world?</v>

174
00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:26.320
<v Speaker 3>You know what gives you risk inflating your own ego by dealing with the problems</v>

175
00:07:26.321 --> 00:07:27.154
<v Speaker 3>of the world.</v>

176
00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.140
<v Speaker 3>It's the cathedral problem again.</v>

177
00:07:29.141 --> 00:07:29.440
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

178
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:29.651
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

179
00:07:29.651 --> 00:07:31.480
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't be at the center of the universe.</v>

180
00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:31.720
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

181
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.141
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>

182
00:07:32.141 --> 00:07:32.421
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

183
00:07:32.421 --> 00:07:32.741
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

184
00:07:32.741 --> 00:07:33.574
<v Speaker 3>well maybe,</v>

185
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.420
<v Speaker 3>maybe not.</v>

186
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to find a resolution of this,</v>

187
00:07:35.951 --> 00:07:39.370
<v Speaker 3>that that goes beyond the existing cultural conflict around it.</v>

188
00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:43.960
<v Speaker 3>Because no doubt people need to attend to their own projection and their own</v>

189
00:07:43.961 --> 00:07:48.070
<v Speaker 3>limitations and have humility and some psychological insight and work harder on</v>

190
00:07:48.071 --> 00:07:49.330
<v Speaker 3>what they're directly responsible for.</v>

191
00:07:49.331 --> 00:07:50.230
<v Speaker 3>I don't doubt that,</v>

192
00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.830
<v Speaker 3>but I am concerned with a message that says that's all you should be doing.</v>

193
00:07:53.831 --> 00:07:54.760
<v Speaker 3>And until you figure that out,</v>

194
00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.750
<v Speaker 3>anything else you should be doing your thing you have to do at first or you can</v>

195
00:07:58.751 --> 00:07:59.201
<v Speaker 3>do that.</v>

196
00:07:59.201 --> 00:08:02.590
<v Speaker 3>You should be very leery of assuming that when you try to do something else,</v>

197
00:08:02.591 --> 00:08:04.900
<v Speaker 3>you won't just make it worse and you will look.</v>

198
00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:07.960
<v Speaker 3>I've dealt with people who've dealt with complex systems for a very long period</v>

199
00:08:07.961 --> 00:08:11.680
<v Speaker 3>of time and I know the difference between someone who can make a complex system</v>

200
00:08:11.681 --> 00:08:15.290
<v Speaker 3>better and someone who will make a complex system worse and most people will</v>

201
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.840
<v Speaker 3>make a complex system worse.</v>

202
00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:17.320
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

203
00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.330
<v Speaker 3>That's for sure that that's okay.</v>

204
00:08:19.331 --> 00:08:21.910
<v Speaker 3>That's good because that's coming to the question of development and the</v>

205
00:08:21.911 --> 00:08:25.060
<v Speaker 3>question of human maturation and the question of what it means to unfold</v>

206
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:25.690
<v Speaker 3>throughout the lifespan.</v>

207
00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:26.530
<v Speaker 3>So just to,</v>

208
00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.150
<v Speaker 3>just to try and distill that last point,</v>

209
00:08:28.151 --> 00:08:32.770
<v Speaker 3>you're sort of saying don't begin and end with your own responsibility of</v>

210
00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:36.200
<v Speaker 3>cleaning your room and sorting your personal and immediate fares out,</v>

211
00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.350
<v Speaker 3>but realize that until you can do that,</v>

212
00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:42.740
<v Speaker 3>you may be lacking a certain forms of competence that might make you die.</v>

213
00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:45.160
<v Speaker 3>Whether you should be quite so visceral and,</v>

214
00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:48.100
<v Speaker 3>and adamant about your political views.</v>

215
00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:49.240
<v Speaker 3>Precisely that.</v>

216
00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:49.600
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

217
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.450
<v Speaker 3>and it's exactly the opposite of what students are taught in universities.</v>

218
00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.030
<v Speaker 3>But you're not saying don't care about those things or don't act on,</v>

219
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:56.640
<v Speaker 3>but just while you're doing them,</v>

220
00:08:56.641 --> 00:08:59.370
<v Speaker 3>attend to your own limitations and competencies.</v>

221
00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:01.130
<v Speaker 4>Well I'm saying you should be aware of,</v>

222
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:03.680
<v Speaker 4>you should be aware of your own competence and your limits.</v>

223
00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:04.040
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

224
00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.200
<v Speaker 4>And that that's especially true if you're very young.</v>

225
00:09:06.201 --> 00:09:06.920
<v Speaker 4>Cause like what the hell?</v>

226
00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:07.340
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

227
00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:08.240
<v Speaker 4>you haven't done anything.</v>

228
00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:08.540
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

229
00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:09.230
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

230
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:10.260
<v Speaker 4>I tell 18 year old,</v>

231
00:09:10.261 --> 00:09:11.690
<v Speaker 4>six years ago you were 12.</v>

232
00:09:11.691 --> 00:09:11.991
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

233
00:09:11.991 --> 00:09:13.540
<v Speaker 4>what the hell do you know you,</v>

234
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:14.350
<v Speaker 4>you haven't,</v>

235
00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:14.591
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

236
00:09:14.591 --> 00:09:14.991
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

237
00:09:14.991 --> 00:09:15.440
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

238
00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:15.831
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

239
00:09:15.831 --> 00:09:17.930
<v Speaker 4>you're under the care of your family or the state.</v>

240
00:09:17.931 --> 00:09:19.910
<v Speaker 4>You haven't established an independent existence.</v>

241
00:09:19.911 --> 00:09:20.810
<v Speaker 4>You haven't had children.</v>

242
00:09:20.811 --> 00:09:21.980
<v Speaker 4>You haven't started a business.</v>

243
00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:23.810
<v Speaker 4>You haven't taken responsibility for anything.</v>

244
00:09:23.811 --> 00:09:24.621
<v Speaker 4>You don't have a degree.</v>

245
00:09:24.621 --> 00:09:25.850
<v Speaker 4>You haven't finished your courses,</v>

246
00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:26.840
<v Speaker 4>you don't know how to read.</v>

247
00:09:26.841 --> 00:09:27.531
<v Speaker 4>You can't thank,</v>

248
00:09:27.531 --> 00:09:28.364
<v Speaker 4>you can't speak.</v>

249
00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:28.800
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>

250
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:29.633
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

251
00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.460
<v Speaker 4>you don't know how to present yourself.</v>

252
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:32.451
<v Speaker 4>Well Jesus,</v>

253
00:09:32.451 --> 00:09:32.990
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

254
00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:37.990
<v Speaker 4>and it's just not right to tell people in that situation that they should go out</v>

255
00:09:38.001 --> 00:09:39.410
<v Speaker 4>and change the socioeconomic,</v>

256
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:40.620
<v Speaker 3>what culture,</v>

257
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:41.453
<v Speaker 3>what those children,</v>

258
00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.970
<v Speaker 3>those children are young people that observe or not wise adults managing complex</v>

259
00:09:44.971 --> 00:09:45.960
<v Speaker 3>systems at that plea.</v>

260
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.020
<v Speaker 3>They see people giving subsidies to fossil fuel companies.</v>

261
00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:51.800
<v Speaker 3>They see people and just teaching them a university or no,</v>

262
00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:55.950
<v Speaker 3>like you're so hung up on the university experience.</v>

263
00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:59.310
<v Speaker 3>Like we keep coming back to this issue of the activist at the university,</v>

264
00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:01.020
<v Speaker 3>which is clearly very salient for you,</v>

265
00:10:01.021 --> 00:10:02.070
<v Speaker 3>but for those who are not there,</v>

266
00:10:02.071 --> 00:10:04.590
<v Speaker 3>it's frankly alienating because you other workers,</v>

267
00:10:04.591 --> 00:10:05.281
<v Speaker 3>so fantastic.</v>

268
00:10:05.281 --> 00:10:08.520
<v Speaker 3>But it keeps coming back to this narrative of these slightly callow students who</v>

269
00:10:08.521 --> 00:10:11.280
<v Speaker 3>are maybe a bit over enthusiastic about a political issue.</v>

270
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:13.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm more concerned with their professors then with the stool.</v>

271
00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:14.040
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

272
00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.870
<v Speaker 3>Also the support with the professors</v>

273
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:19.530
<v Speaker 4>completely corrupted the humanities and the humanities are the core of the</v>

274
00:10:19.531 --> 00:10:20.161
<v Speaker 4>university.</v>

275
00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:21.810
<v Speaker 4>And by corrupting the humanities,</v>

276
00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:25.350
<v Speaker 4>they're corrupting the fundamental structure of our civilization and they're</v>

277
00:10:25.351 --> 00:10:27.120
<v Speaker 4>spreading that out into the general culture.</v>

278
00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:27.540
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

279
00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:28.800
<v Speaker 4>But then there's no excuse for that.</v>

280
00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:29.740
<v Speaker 3>They may be doing that,</v>

281
00:10:29.741 --> 00:10:32.640
<v Speaker 3>but simultaneously others are corrupting the ecological foundations,</v>

282
00:10:32.641 --> 00:10:33.660
<v Speaker 3>the social foundations.</v>

283
00:10:33.661 --> 00:10:35.100
<v Speaker 3>Democracy is arguably dying.</v>

284
00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.400
<v Speaker 3>There are real problems that are existential threats that are on a different</v>

285
00:10:38.401 --> 00:10:39.234
<v Speaker 3>level.</v>

286
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.650
<v Speaker 3>There's multiple large variety of ways.</v>

287
00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:44.630
<v Speaker 3>And I don't think that's happening principally because some people are being</v>

288
00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.680
<v Speaker 3>taught feminist theory and the University of Toronto.</v>

289
00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:51.090
<v Speaker 3>It's not that it's something else much bigger and broader and deeper that when</v>

290
00:10:51.091 --> 00:10:51.990
<v Speaker 3>people raise these issues,</v>

291
00:10:51.991 --> 00:10:53.400
<v Speaker 3>you focus on that small issue,</v>

292
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:55.050
<v Speaker 3>not the big ones that they're worried about.</v>

293
00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:55.981
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

294
00:10:55.981 --> 00:10:57.690
<v Speaker 3>it depends on the issue I suppose.</v>

295
00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:58.410
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

296
00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:00.060
<v Speaker 3>I would say for example,</v>

297
00:11:00.061 --> 00:11:01.080
<v Speaker 3>just for argument's sake,</v>

298
00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:02.361
<v Speaker 3>well what,</v>

299
00:11:02.361 --> 00:11:04.140
<v Speaker 3>what should I say about climate change?</v>

300
00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:05.670
<v Speaker 3>What should you do to drive here?</v>

301
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:06.300
<v Speaker 3>If you were,</v>

302
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:06.960
<v Speaker 3>no I didn't.</v>

303
00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:07.501
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want,</v>

304
00:11:07.501 --> 00:11:07.981
<v Speaker 3>what did you do?</v>

305
00:11:07.981 --> 00:11:08.420
<v Speaker 3>How'd you do?</v>

306
00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:09.510
<v Speaker 3>I took public transport,</v>

307
00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.273
<v Speaker 3>but that's not really,</v>

308
00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:11.761
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>

309
00:11:11.761 --> 00:11:12.850
<v Speaker 3>that's hardly the point.</v>

310
00:11:12.851 --> 00:11:13.684
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

311
00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:14.540
<v Speaker 4>Well the point,</v>

312
00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:18.690
<v Speaker 4>because it's part of the problem with climate change is irreducible complexity,</v>

313
00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:19.140
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

314
00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:19.501
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

315
00:11:19.501 --> 00:11:19.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

316
00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:20.261
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

317
00:11:20.261 --> 00:11:21.094
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

318
00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:24.360
<v Speaker 4>there's a cost to our existence and the cost is externalization,</v>

319
00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:25.090
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

320
00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:27.600
<v Speaker 4>Externalization of costs and we don't know how to manage that.</v>

321
00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:27.810
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

322
00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:28.321
<v Speaker 4>And I would say,</v>

323
00:11:28.321 --> 00:11:29.460
<v Speaker 4>should we be concerned about it?</v>

324
00:11:29.461 --> 00:11:29.700
<v Speaker 4>So like,</v>

325
00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:30.390
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

326
00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:31.200
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>

327
00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.290
<v Speaker 4>Do we know how to be concerned about it yet?</v>

328
00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:33.990
<v Speaker 3>Not really.</v>

329
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:34.520
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] right.</v>

330
00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:34.821
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

331
00:11:34.821 --> 00:11:36.250
<v Speaker 3>so then how do we learn does that,</v>

332
00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:37.280
<v Speaker 3>that becomes the question,</v>

333
00:11:37.281 --> 00:11:37.700
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

334
00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:39.110
<v Speaker 3>So the younger generation who are,</v>

335
00:11:39.111 --> 00:11:43.520
<v Speaker 3>who like give me an example more directly affected the kinds of people in</v>

336
00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:46.760
<v Speaker 3>developing countries and younger people who feel the pinch of this all the</v>

337
00:11:46.761 --> 00:11:47.031
<v Speaker 3>morning.</v>

338
00:11:47.031 --> 00:11:47.864
<v Speaker 3>Cause they can see,</v>

339
00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:48.711
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

340
00:11:48.711 --> 00:11:49.161
<v Speaker 3>New York,</v>

341
00:11:49.161 --> 00:11:52.610
<v Speaker 3>the chancellor thing underwater by by the end of the century is not negligible</v>

342
00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:54.070
<v Speaker 3>and therefore they're</v>

343
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:56.380
<v Speaker 4>looking for a response that really matters to them.</v>

344
00:11:56.381 --> 00:11:57.730
<v Speaker 4>And when you think about responsibility,</v>

345
00:11:57.731 --> 00:11:58.810
<v Speaker 4>I think this number,</v>

346
00:11:58.811 --> 00:12:02.200
<v Speaker 4>they're view is don't patronize me about my bedroom when I've got the planet to</v>

347
00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:03.043
<v Speaker 4>say</v>

348
00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:05.710
<v Speaker 4>there is no,</v>

349
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:05.950
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

350
00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:06.130
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

351
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:06.701
<v Speaker 4>it's a boy.</v>

352
00:12:06.701 --> 00:12:07.420
<v Speaker 4>I understand.</v>

353
00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:08.920
<v Speaker 4>I think your bedroom is important,</v>

354
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:09.863
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

355
00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:13.420
<v Speaker 4>I mean do you think the whole planet is more important?</v>

356
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.830
<v Speaker 4>They're more concerned about that.</v>

357
00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:18.010
<v Speaker 4>And One why is your room is a microcosm of the planet,</v>

358
00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:18.370
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

359
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:18.881
<v Speaker 4>Without tell.</v>

360
00:12:18.881 --> 00:12:19.714
<v Speaker 4>Tell us about that then.</v>

361
00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:20.471
<v Speaker 4>Well let's,</v>

362
00:12:20.471 --> 00:12:20.771
<v Speaker 4>let's,</v>

363
00:12:20.771 --> 00:12:25.210
<v Speaker 4>let's go back to the climate issue here first because there's this guy that I'm</v>

364
00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:25.691
<v Speaker 4>aware of.</v>

365
00:12:25.691 --> 00:12:28.810
<v Speaker 4>His name is Boyan Slat and I'm going to talk to him in the relatively near</v>

366
00:12:28.811 --> 00:12:29.644
<v Speaker 4>future I think.</v>

367
00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:31.330
<v Speaker 4>And he's a model for,</v>

368
00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:32.380
<v Speaker 4>for young people.</v>

369
00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:35.740
<v Speaker 4>He went out scuba diving when he was 17 and there was a lot of plastic,</v>

370
00:12:35.741 --> 00:12:35.921
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

371
00:12:35.921 --> 00:12:36.820
<v Speaker 4>and that sort of bothered him.</v>

372
00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:39.220
<v Speaker 4>And then he started thinking about Manta rays and how they move through the</v>

373
00:12:39.221 --> 00:12:39.551
<v Speaker 4>water.</v>

374
00:12:39.551 --> 00:12:42.640
<v Speaker 4>And then he noticed that most of the plastic was in the top six inches.</v>

375
00:12:42.641 --> 00:12:43.474
<v Speaker 4>And then he thought,</v>

376
00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.450
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if I could build a machine that was like a Manta ray that would float</v>

377
00:12:46.451 --> 00:12:47.290
<v Speaker 4>on top of the water.</v>

378
00:12:47.291 --> 00:12:48.040
<v Speaker 4>And anyways,</v>

379
00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.300
<v Speaker 4>to make a long story short,</v>

380
00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:54.540
<v Speaker 4>he's devised a way to rid 50% of the plastic in the world's oceans within five</v>

381
00:12:54.731 --> 00:12:58.540
<v Speaker 4>years and has spent the last six years developing that and is well on the way to</v>

382
00:12:58.541 --> 00:12:59.231
<v Speaker 4>implementing it.</v>

383
00:12:59.231 --> 00:13:02.500
<v Speaker 4>And it looks like it might work and he's going to be able to make a profit from</v>

384
00:13:02.501 --> 00:13:04.840
<v Speaker 4>it just to add that extra bit of punch.</v>

385
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:06.340
<v Speaker 4>And so by on slot,</v>

386
00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:07.210
<v Speaker 4>I would say it's like,</v>

387
00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:08.890
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if his room was clean or not,</v>

388
00:13:08.891 --> 00:13:12.010
<v Speaker 4>but there was something about him that was dead on because when he looked at a</v>

389
00:13:12.011 --> 00:13:12.641
<v Speaker 4>problem like that,</v>

390
00:13:12.641 --> 00:13:13.210
<v Speaker 4>he thought,</v>

391
00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:15.550
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to go out there and tell a bunch of other people what they're</v>

392
00:13:15.551 --> 00:13:17.080
<v Speaker 4>doing wrong so that they can solve it.</v>

393
00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.520
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to bloody well fix it.</v>

394
00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:21.790
<v Speaker 4>And that's what I'm telling young men in particular to do.</v>

395
00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:22.360
<v Speaker 4>Although,</v>

396
00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:22.631
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

397
00:13:22.631 --> 00:13:24.310
<v Speaker 4>I'm feeling women want to do that.</v>

398
00:13:24.311 --> 00:13:25.121
<v Speaker 4>It's like great.</v>

399
00:13:25.121 --> 00:13:26.080
<v Speaker 4>More power to them,</v>

400
00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:27.610
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

401
00:13:27.611 --> 00:13:28.121
<v Speaker 4>people say,</v>

402
00:13:28.121 --> 00:13:28.301
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

403
00:13:28.301 --> 00:13:30.160
<v Speaker 4>I'm taking climate change seriously.</v>

404
00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:31.480
<v Speaker 4>I'm going out to protests.</v>

405
00:13:31.481 --> 00:13:33.040
<v Speaker 4>Like you're not taking it seriously.</v>

406
00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:34.120
<v Speaker 4>That's not serious.</v>

407
00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:37.840
<v Speaker 4>Serious is you're going to devote 80 hours of your life to it for the rest of</v>

408
00:13:37.841 --> 00:13:38.261
<v Speaker 4>your life,</v>

409
00:13:38.261 --> 00:13:38.411
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

410
00:13:38.411 --> 00:13:41.380
<v Speaker 4>You're going to work on that so intently that you're not even going to think</v>

411
00:13:41.381 --> 00:13:43.200
<v Speaker 4>about anything else that's here.</v>
