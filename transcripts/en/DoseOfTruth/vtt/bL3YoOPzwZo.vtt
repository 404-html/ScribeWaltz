<v Speaker 1>I've got chickens in my backyard and I do a little chicken coop</v>

97
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.980
<v Speaker 1>in the back of my house because it was raining and couldn't see the cool from</v>

98
00:05:35.981 --> 00:05:37.050
<v Speaker 1>the back window,</v>

99
00:05:37.051 --> 00:05:39.220
<v Speaker 1>so he just decides to walk right into my bedroom.</v>

100
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.010
<v Speaker 1>Empty.</v>

101

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.590
<v Speaker 1>cleaned her room.</v>

107
00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.800
<v Speaker 1>We had just come back from my room was a disaster.</v>

108
00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:03.520
<v Speaker 1>I just don't my bag out there was stuff everywhere.</v>

109
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.070
<v Speaker 1>PC literally jumps over all my crap all over the floor.</v>

110
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.810
<v Speaker 1>He's staring out the window looking at my dad and I realize that there's a big</v>

111
00:06:11.811 --> 00:06:12.830
<v Speaker 1>bag of weed on my night.</v>

112
00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.420
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was going to get more bloated or</v>

113
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.093
<v Speaker 1>kinda</v>

114
00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:26.993
<v Speaker 1>friendly</v>

115
00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:34.380
<v Speaker 1>hanging out with all these fingers.</v>

116
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:35.570
<v Speaker 1>The last thing I want to do is to</v>

117
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:39.620
<v Speaker 1>shut my brain off.</v>

118
00:06:39.621 --> 00:06:40.454
<v Speaker 1>That would be better.</v>

119
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.110
<v Speaker 1>Are you almost ready for Jordan?</v>

120
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.480

122
00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.130
<v Speaker 1>I said we'd done about eight or nine these.</v>

123
00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:55.230
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

125
00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:56.960
<v Speaker 1>when we kicked this off,</v>

126
00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:03.040
<v Speaker 1>something really cool guy and I think I'm going to do this and I think it sums</v>

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:20.340
<v Speaker 2>Thanks Jordan Peterson.</v>

147
00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:55.890
<v Speaker 2>Thank</v>

148
00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:40.900
<v Speaker 2>you for</v>

149
00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:44.923
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

150
00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:58.690
<v Speaker 2>Thank</v>

151
00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:03.680
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

152
00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:06.550
<v Speaker 2>We have the most elaborate costume.</v>

153
00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:13.900
<v Speaker 2>Thank</v>

154
00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:20.080
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>

155
00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:25.080
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you one thing that I do really like guideline right from the</v>

156
00:11:25.261 --> 00:11:26.160
<v Speaker 2>beginning.</v>

157
00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:29.100
<v Speaker 2>Whatever.</v>

158
00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:34.740
<v Speaker 2>There's been something humorous associated with what I've been doing online and</v>

159
00:11:34.741 --> 00:11:35.950
<v Speaker 2>that's a really good thing.</v>

160
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:40.800
<v Speaker 2>This is comedy that goes along with this because for them to be a comic on your</v>

161
00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:42.600
<v Speaker 2>toe to anything beats that it's gone.</v>

162
00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:44.280
<v Speaker 2>At least some degree health,</v>

163
00:11:44.281 --> 00:11:44.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

164
00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.770
<v Speaker 2>it's not taking itself too seriously.</v>

165
00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:50.440
<v Speaker 2>The see people who've gone through courbet shirts on steam</v>

166
00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.540
<v Speaker 2>and vertebrates</v>

167
00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.380
<v Speaker 3>the intellectual level of discourse.</v>

168
00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:02.950
<v Speaker 3>So I have a little story to tell you.</v>

169
00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:04.630
<v Speaker 3>Something kind of Nice to be today.</v>

170
00:12:04.631 --> 00:12:07.030
<v Speaker 3>It's probably more relevant to me because I'm a Canadian,</v>

171
00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:11.100
<v Speaker 3>but there's a magazine in Canada called Maclean's and they ran a club,</v>

172
00:12:11.101 --> 00:12:13.360
<v Speaker 3>a hit piece on it about three months ago.</v>

173
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.090
<v Speaker 3>A woman named Tabitha Southey wrote,</v>

174
00:12:16.091 --> 00:12:16.720
<v Speaker 3>attend.</v>

175
00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:20.410
<v Speaker 3>She's got quite an ambitious woman and she can coin a phrase.</v>

176
00:12:20.411 --> 00:12:22.150
<v Speaker 3>I think he called me the stupid person,</v>

177
00:12:22.151 --> 00:12:27.151
<v Speaker 3>smart person that has been better than the stupid person's stupid person I</v>

178
00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:28.914
<v Speaker 3>suppose.</v>

179
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:33.640
<v Speaker 3>But that phrase has been bandied around on the internet sort of Ad Nauseum in</v>

180
00:12:33.641 --> 00:12:34.910
<v Speaker 3>subsets in the system.</v>

181
00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:35.950
<v Speaker 3>But today,</v>

182
00:12:35.951 --> 00:12:36.550
<v Speaker 3>and this was.</v>

183
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:41.550
<v Speaker 3>This was what was cool because there's been an attempt I would say,</v>

184
00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:46.970
<v Speaker 3>by the people who aren't very fun to me too is to attempt to politicize what I</v>

185
00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:54.340
<v Speaker 3>attempted to do some justification for that I suppose because I have been going</v>

186
00:12:54.341 --> 00:12:59.320
<v Speaker 3>after the radical leftists with a fair bit of seriousness,</v>

187
00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:04.530
<v Speaker 3>but I think because they jumped the political but they started to tread in</v>

188
00:13:04.751 --> 00:13:05.584
<v Speaker 3>water.</v>

189
00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:10.440
<v Speaker 3>It started to trend the territory that had no business being politicized with</v>

190
00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.340
<v Speaker 3>restrictions on free speech in particular,</v>

191
00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:18.180
<v Speaker 3>but I don't regard what I'm trying to do is particularly political and I think</v>

192
00:13:18.371 --> 00:13:22.390
<v Speaker 3>that's partly because I've known fundamentally a political figure.</v>

193
00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:26.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm fundamentally a clinical psychologist with a secondary identity as a</v>

194
00:13:26.861 --> 00:13:30.310
<v Speaker 3>university professor or perhaps those identities convenient flight.</v>

195
00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:31.430
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't really matter.</v>

196
00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:34.150
<v Speaker 3>It's part and parcel of the same thing as far as I'm concerned.</v>

197
00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:40.020
<v Speaker 3>What I've been focused on in my private practice as an educator is trying to</v>

198
00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:47.580
<v Speaker 3>disseminate psychological information of the highest caliber to individuals</v>

199
00:13:48.041 --> 00:13:50.140
<v Speaker 3>because that's where clinical psychologists do.</v>

200
00:13:50.141 --> 00:13:54.150
<v Speaker 3>We work with individuals because I think the individuals,</v>

201
00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:55.480
<v Speaker 3>the right level of analysis,</v>

202
00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:55.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

203
00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.240
<v Speaker 3>when I come out and see a crowd like this,</v>

204
00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:00.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't see the crowd,</v>

205
00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:05.500
<v Speaker 3>which is partly why I'm actually not afraid of the crowd because I see a bunch</v>

206
00:14:05.501 --> 00:14:08.710
<v Speaker 3>of individuals and you're sitting here and when I talked to the crowd,</v>

207
00:14:08.711 --> 00:14:09.670
<v Speaker 3>I don't talk to the crowd,</v>

208
00:14:09.671 --> 00:14:09.940
<v Speaker 3>either,</v>

209
00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:11.590
<v Speaker 3>won't talk to people in the crowd.</v>

210
00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.520
<v Speaker 3>And so Mcclain's,</v>

211
00:14:15.521 --> 00:14:18.160
<v Speaker 3>which is the magazine that published this piece,</v>

212
00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:21.410
<v Speaker 3>satirical piece on me a few months ago,</v>

213
00:14:21.411 --> 00:14:25.780
<v Speaker 3>we actually took the time to send a reporter out to a group that had been</v>

214
00:14:25.781 --> 00:14:27.490
<v Speaker 3>established in Toronto,</v>

215
00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:30.230
<v Speaker 3>which was a Jordan Peterson meetup group.</v>

216
00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:30.730
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>

217
00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:34.100
<v Speaker 3>Essentially it's about 50 people or so it would meet up regularly.</v>

218
00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:37.920
<v Speaker 3>They actually sent a reporter out to find out what these reprobates interruptive</v>

219
00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:40.610
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

220
00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:42.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

221
00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:47.290
<v Speaker 3>if you paid attention to the corner of the journalism world,</v>

222
00:14:47.411 --> 00:14:50.690
<v Speaker 3>that is not very happy with my existence.</v>

223
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:53.920
<v Speaker 3>You would assume that it would be an asset of,</v>

224
00:14:53.921 --> 00:14:54.754
<v Speaker 3>all right.</v>

225
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:58.730
<v Speaker 3>Essentially all male,</v>

226
00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:03.160
<v Speaker 3>all angry old white because of course that's how the radical left characterized</v>

227
00:15:03.161 --> 00:15:03.771
<v Speaker 3>as people,</v>

228
00:15:03.771 --> 00:15:04.041
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

229
00:15:04.041 --> 00:15:07.700
<v Speaker 3>They characterize them by gender and race into everything becomes politicized in</v>

230
00:15:07.701 --> 00:15:08.534
<v Speaker 3>that map,</v>

231
00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:10.820
<v Speaker 3>which I think is absolutely contemptible,</v>

232
00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:15.470
<v Speaker 3>but it turned out that 40 percent of the people who came to this meeting,</v>

233
00:15:15.471 --> 00:15:18.290
<v Speaker 3>we're women and then a very large</v>

234
00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:28.190
<v Speaker 3>are you all feeling and you know</v>

235
00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:35.930
<v Speaker 3>a large number of them were were children are first generation immigrants who</v>

236
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:38.390
<v Speaker 3>weren't by any stretch of the imagination,</v>

237
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:40.290
<v Speaker 3>mainstream Protestant,</v>

238
00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:41.030
<v Speaker 3>Caucasians,</v>

239
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:45.790
<v Speaker 3>and so the first part of the narrative fell apart and then the second part in</v>

240
00:15:45.791 --> 00:15:48.500
<v Speaker 3>the air and it fell apart because it turns out that these people were getting</v>

241
00:15:48.501 --> 00:15:52.760
<v Speaker 3>together to see if figuring out how they could get the damn lights together and</v>

242
00:15:52.761 --> 00:15:56.150
<v Speaker 3>they're serious about it and they weren't getting their life together in a</v>

243
00:15:56.151 --> 00:16:01.151
<v Speaker 3>manner that was designed to propel them in some sense to a power position.</v>

244
00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.020
<v Speaker 3>In an arbitrary dominance hierarchy.</v>

245
00:16:03.021 --> 00:16:05.930
<v Speaker 3>They were trying to get their lives together so that they can be better as</v>

246
00:16:05.931 --> 00:16:08.450
<v Speaker 3>individuals so that they can be better for their families.</v>

247
00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:09.770
<v Speaker 3>So they could be better.</v>

248
00:16:09.771 --> 00:16:14.150
<v Speaker 3>For their communities and they were actually serious about it and in an age</v>

249
00:16:14.151 --> 00:16:16.880
<v Speaker 3>where everyone is cynical about everything,</v>

250
00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:22.130
<v Speaker 3>it's really something to know that there are people who are not cynical about</v>

251
00:16:22.131 --> 00:16:26.180
<v Speaker 3>things that are that important and so it was a pleasant surprise to see this</v>

252
00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:31.540
<v Speaker 3>article published in the same magazine that had played tricks with what I had</v>

253
00:16:31.881 --> 00:16:36.470
<v Speaker 3>been doing before and I'm hoping that that will continue because it would be a</v>

254
00:16:36.471 --> 00:16:37.900
<v Speaker 3>lovely thing if it did.</v>

255
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000
<v Speaker 3>I know from talking to people who come to events like this that know some of you</v>

256
00:16:44.691 --> 00:16:46.820
<v Speaker 3>were here primarily for political reasons,</v>

257
00:16:46.821 --> 00:16:47.240
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

258
00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.010
<v Speaker 3>And that's fine because there's a.</v>

259
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:52.550
<v Speaker 3>it's not like the political realm is irrelevant instance.</v>

260
00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:53.870
<v Speaker 3>It's by no means irrelevant,</v>

261
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:59.230
<v Speaker 3>but I know that most of the people who come to these talks comp because because</v>

262
00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:04.880
<v Speaker 3>we're trying to do something about putting our individual lives together and so</v>

263
00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:08.410
<v Speaker 3>and that's the right thing to do as far as I'm concerned is the right level.</v>

264
00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:13.510
<v Speaker 3>Thank.</v>

265
00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.760
<v Speaker 3>Thanks.</v>

266
00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:22.420
<v Speaker 3>So I'm going to talk to you about my 12 rules for life is about but more about</v>

267
00:17:23.811 --> 00:17:24.680
<v Speaker 3>the ideas in the book.</v>

268
00:17:24.681 --> 00:17:25.700
<v Speaker 3>Then the book itself,</v>

269
00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:30.140
<v Speaker 3>and I'm always working on the ideas and so I use these talks as an opportunity</v>

270
00:17:30.141 --> 00:17:35.080
<v Speaker 3>to further my thinking along the different lines that I'm attempting to thinking</v>

271
00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:39.620
<v Speaker 3>to make the story that I'm telling more and more coherent and more communicable</v>

272
00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:42.170
<v Speaker 3>and so I'll start with that.</v>

273
00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:43.730
<v Speaker 3>I'll start with rule one.</v>

274
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:44.881
<v Speaker 3>Rule One,</v>

275
00:17:44.881 --> 00:17:47.930
<v Speaker 3>his stand up straight with your shoulders back and it contains the,</v>

276
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:49.063
<v Speaker 3>I suppose,</v>

277
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:54.230
<v Speaker 3>infamous commentary on crustaceans and trying to make a point and I should point</v>

278
00:17:56.311 --> 00:17:59.880
<v Speaker 3>out because I was making a point that should actually be of great interest to</v>

279
00:17:59.881 --> 00:18:03.690
<v Speaker 3>people on the left and the people on the left are of course concerned with the</v>

280
00:18:03.691 --> 00:18:07.470
<v Speaker 3>distance house and that's why you need a left wing into your political structure</v>

281
00:18:07.471 --> 00:18:09.860
<v Speaker 3>because someone needs to be concerned with his house.</v>

282
00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:13.780
<v Speaker 3>But what point did I was trying to make in the first chapter was</v>

283
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:20.830
<v Speaker 3>hierarchies are inevitable and the fact that they're inevitability is evidence</v>

284
00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:26.360
<v Speaker 3>in the existence of hierarchies in domains of life.</v>

285
00:18:27.301 --> 00:18:29.640
<v Speaker 3>Far outside of the human domain.</v>

286
00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:35.820
<v Speaker 3>The hierarchies have been around for $30 billion a year and there are permanent</v>

287
00:18:35.821 --> 00:18:37.560
<v Speaker 3>structural elements of existence.</v>

288
00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:39.320
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't mean I was justifying.</v>

289
00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:41.590
<v Speaker 3>We get something that exists.</v>

290
00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.360
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to justify it.</v>

291
00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:44.660
<v Speaker 3>You took point on fit.</v>

292
00:18:44.661 --> 00:18:49.661
<v Speaker 3>It exists now where the hierarchies is it completely separate issue in public</v>

293
00:18:50.351 --> 00:18:52.350
<v Speaker 3>dressed very briefly in a moment,</v>

294
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:54.023
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

295
00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:57.660
<v Speaker 3>there's a moral,</v>

296
00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:01.860
<v Speaker 3>there's a lesson to be derived from the fact that hierarchies are ancient and</v>

297
00:19:01.861 --> 00:19:06.861
<v Speaker 3>that is if you're a critic of hierarchies and there are negative consequences,</v>

298
00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:14.720
<v Speaker 3>you cannot lay here existence at the feet of western civilization or capitalism</v>

299
00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:21.020
<v Speaker 3>or the free market or the patriarchy because it's western civilization.</v>

300
00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:22.770
<v Speaker 3>Capitalism,</v>

301
00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:24.720
<v Speaker 3>the free market and the patriarchy,</v>

302
00:19:24.721 --> 00:19:26.350
<v Speaker 3>which is a word by the way,</v>

303
00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:29.010
<v Speaker 3>didn't give rise to hire a consultant.</v>

304
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:31.790
<v Speaker 3>And you could tell that because monsters have,</v>

305
00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:33.210
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

306
00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:37.560
<v Speaker 3>So there's a third of a billion years of social labs organization into</v>

307
00:19:37.561 --> 00:19:40.680
<v Speaker 3>hierarchies and you can put that at the feet of,</v>

308
00:19:40.681 --> 00:19:40.791
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

309
00:19:40.791 --> 00:19:43.320
<v Speaker 3>political economic system period.</v>

310
00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:44.850
<v Speaker 3>And so it's for that reason,</v>

311
00:19:44.851 --> 00:19:45.750
<v Speaker 3>among many,</v>

312
00:19:45.751 --> 00:19:46.290
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>

313
00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:47.300
<v Speaker 3>many other reasons.</v>

314
00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:49.940
<v Speaker 3>The says are wrong.</v>

315
00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:51.353
<v Speaker 3>You're not wrong.</v>

316
00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:05.410
<v Speaker 3>They're wrong in a way that it's going to make it impossible for well oriented</v>

317
00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:09.590
<v Speaker 3>business who were actually concerned about the desert is acid,</v>

318
00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:13.970
<v Speaker 3>let's say the struggling working class to actually make more headway in their</v>

319
00:20:13.971 --> 00:20:17.900
<v Speaker 3>attempts to deal with the district capacity because their underlying theory is</v>

320
00:20:17.901 --> 00:20:21.420
<v Speaker 3>wrong and it's wrong because it's not serious.</v>

321
00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:22.840
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

322
00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:25.810
<v Speaker 3>like I don't talk to you a slave.</v>

323
00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:29.660
<v Speaker 3>The reason for hierarchies isn't a negative consequences,</v>

324
00:20:29.661 --> 00:20:31.850
<v Speaker 3>so we'll go through this quite quickly.</v>

325
00:20:31.851 --> 00:20:33.890
<v Speaker 3>So here's a truism.</v>

326
00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:37.270
<v Speaker 3>Need something to do with your life.</v>

327
00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:38.113
<v Speaker 3>It's worthwhile.</v>

328
00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:42.230
<v Speaker 3>You need something to email and it's a deep true.</v>

329
00:20:42.231 --> 00:20:47.210
<v Speaker 3>Is it because the creatures of it couldn't move roughly speaking,</v>

330
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:49.130
<v Speaker 3>need something Neymat.</v>

331
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:55.040
<v Speaker 3>Every creature that moves in the world that isn't statically place,</v>

332
00:20:55.080 --> 00:21:00.080
<v Speaker 3>like a plant has to aim for something and generally they infer an improvement in</v>

333
00:21:02.141 --> 00:21:02.741
<v Speaker 3>their condition.</v>

334
00:21:02.741 --> 00:21:07.741
<v Speaker 3>So every living creature that moves lived in a value lives in a value structure</v>

335
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:11.560
<v Speaker 3>and the value structure or something like where they are isn't as good as where</v>

336
00:21:11.561 --> 00:21:12.394
<v Speaker 3>they're going to.</v>

337
00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.620
<v Speaker 3>And so there's a Knoxville good.</v>

338
00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:16.980
<v Speaker 3>That's where you are and there's a bedroom which is where you're heading,</v>

339
00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:21.040
<v Speaker 3>that's a value structure and you look at the world through value structure.</v>

340
00:21:21.041 --> 00:21:22.180
<v Speaker 3>You would happen to value structure,</v>

341
00:21:22.181 --> 00:21:26.350
<v Speaker 3>but assuming that you're actually going to move in the world and you need to</v>

342
00:21:26.351 --> 00:21:28.780
<v Speaker 3>move into the world and the reason you need to move in the world is because if</v>

343
00:21:28.781 --> 00:21:31.360
<v Speaker 3>you just stay in one place that you've died terribly,</v>

344
00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:34.470
<v Speaker 3>so it's not optional to move forward in the world.</v>

345
00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:35.090
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

346
00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:36.160
<v Speaker 3>It's necessary.</v>

347
00:21:36.161 --> 00:21:40.480
<v Speaker 3>It's necessary psychophysiologic lane and it's necessary psychologically as well</v>

348
00:21:40.481 --> 00:21:43.810
<v Speaker 3>because it turns out that the way that people derive most of their positive</v>

349
00:21:43.811 --> 00:21:44.290
<v Speaker 3>emotion,</v>

350
00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:48.100
<v Speaker 3>which is the antidote to the suffering that's it taken to life,</v>

351
00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.590
<v Speaker 3>is by naming something worth attaining.</v>

352
00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:52.090
<v Speaker 3>That's where the meaning comes from.</v>

353
00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:53.770
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

354
00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:56.000
<v Speaker 3>the problem with naming and something worth updating,</v>

355
00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:58.030
<v Speaker 3>especially if you do that in a social environment,</v>

356
00:21:58.031 --> 00:22:02.120
<v Speaker 3>is that you immediately set up a competitive under corporate plans.</v>

357
00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.180
<v Speaker 3>We'll call it the competitive landscape for them,</v>

358
00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:05.171
<v Speaker 3>for the time being.</v>

359
00:22:05.171 --> 00:22:07.780
<v Speaker 3>Because no matter what it is that you're aiming at doing,</v>

360
00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:09.400
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to do it with other people,</v>

361
00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:12.610
<v Speaker 3>some people are going to be better at it than other people and it doesn't</v>

362
00:22:12.611 --> 00:22:12.941
<v Speaker 3>matter.</v>

363
00:22:12.941 --> 00:22:14.560
<v Speaker 3>It can be something as benign.</v>

364
00:22:14.561 --> 00:22:16.420
<v Speaker 3>Let's say it's going to have a massage.</v>

365
00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:22.030
<v Speaker 3>Massage is something that you think is good and then that's a service that's</v>

366
00:22:22.031 --> 00:22:23.350
<v Speaker 3>offered in your city.</v>

367
00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:27.790
<v Speaker 3>Then there's going to be a hierarchical rank ordering of people who are good at</v>

368
00:22:27.791 --> 00:22:31.690
<v Speaker 3>being massage therapists and running their businesses and it's not because</v>

369
00:22:31.691 --> 00:22:35.710
<v Speaker 3>they're more powerful or because they're oppressing the other massage</v>

370
00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:36.553
<v Speaker 3>therapists.</v>

371
00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:39.910
<v Speaker 3>It isn't that even though some of them might be somewhat crooked in their</v>

372
00:22:39.911 --> 00:22:42.340
<v Speaker 3>business events and maybe somewhat underhanded,</v>

373
00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:42.490
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

374
00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:44.880
<v Speaker 3>it's something that's massage therapists are generally known for.</v>

375
00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:51.790
<v Speaker 3>When you take the critique of capitalism and you make it,</v>

376
00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:53.650
<v Speaker 3>make it specific in that matter,</v>

377
00:22:53.651 --> 00:22:57.910
<v Speaker 3>you start to see how absurd it is to assume that the only reason that people</v>

378
00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:02.590
<v Speaker 3>attain prominence in the discipline is because of a tyrannical power and</v>

379
00:23:02.591 --> 00:23:03.130
<v Speaker 3>oppression.</v>

380
00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:03.700
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

381
00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:03.851
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

382
00:23:03.851 --> 00:23:06.280
<v Speaker 3>that's part of it because every system is imperfect,</v>

383
00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:10.330
<v Speaker 3>but mostly it's a matter of the mere fact that once you caught them that</v>

384
00:23:10.331 --> 00:23:11.200
<v Speaker 3>something's worth doing,</v>

385
00:23:11.201 --> 00:23:12.780
<v Speaker 3>you immediately produced a hierarchy.</v>

386
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.490
<v Speaker 3>Now what generally happens is the right way,</v>

387
00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:16.810
<v Speaker 3>roughly speaking,</v>

388
00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:20.970
<v Speaker 3>supports and promotes the structure of the hierarchy.</v>

389
00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.700
<v Speaker 3>He says that's a good thing and the lab says,</v>

390
00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:24.610
<v Speaker 3>wait a second.</v>

391
00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:25.820
<v Speaker 3>As soon as you make a hierarchy,</v>

392
00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:28.280
<v Speaker 3>people stack up at the bottom and that's not good.</v>

393
00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:31.750
<v Speaker 3>You have to do something about that and fair enough.</v>

394
00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:33.730
<v Speaker 3>You do have to do something about that,</v>

395
00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:38.620
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't mean that you get to put the reason for the hierarchy at the</v>

396
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:40.300
<v Speaker 3>fee up,</v>

397
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:42.240
<v Speaker 3>the social structure that you have to happen.</v>

398
00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:43.390
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

399
00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:47.420
<v Speaker 3>the other proposition I lean forward in one,</v>

400
00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:49.400
<v Speaker 3>which has also been subject to,</v>

401
00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:54.880
<v Speaker 3>I would say ill informed critique is the idea that there's a hierarchy and then</v>

402
00:23:56.930 --> 00:24:00.060
<v Speaker 3>what you do is make yourself powerful so you can find a heart,</v>

403
00:24:00.061 --> 00:24:01.760
<v Speaker 3>but that's what I said.</v>

404
00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:02.960
<v Speaker 3>It's not what I meant.</v>

405
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.110
<v Speaker 3>You will be thinking about if you think that the only reason for hierarchies is</v>

406
00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:07.220
<v Speaker 3>brute force,</v>

407
00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:08.930
<v Speaker 3>because if the only reason for hierarchies,</v>

408
00:24:08.931 --> 00:24:12.410
<v Speaker 3>brute force and obviously what you need to be is more of a decline in the</v>

409
00:24:12.411 --> 00:24:13.240
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy,</v>

410
00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:17.750
<v Speaker 3>but that is the case because well structured hierarchies aren't based on power.</v>

411
00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:18.681
<v Speaker 3>Tyrannical,</v>

412
00:24:18.681 --> 00:24:22.970
<v Speaker 3>pathological hierarchies are based on power and not only in the human world,</v>

413
00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:25.220
<v Speaker 3>but also in the animal world.</v>

414
00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:29.810
<v Speaker 3>So this is another truth that transcends the mere merely socio-cultural.</v>

415
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:35.230
<v Speaker 3>What I've been suggesting to rule one was the most effective way of orienting</v>

416
00:24:35.751 --> 00:24:38.540
<v Speaker 3>yourself within a hierarchy isn't power.</v>

417
00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:42.350
<v Speaker 3>It's competence and its competence of a very peculiar short.</v>

418
00:24:42.351 --> 00:24:43.041
<v Speaker 3>So he might say,</v>

419
00:24:43.041 --> 00:24:44.210
<v Speaker 3>well no,</v>

420
00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:45.590
<v Speaker 3>there isn't just managing.</v>

421
00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:48.860
<v Speaker 3>You're about to be born and you didn't know where you were going to be born and</v>

422
00:24:48.861 --> 00:24:51.440
<v Speaker 3>you want it to have the right characteristics to seek.</v>

423
00:24:51.441 --> 00:24:52.860
<v Speaker 3>See wherever you landed.</v>

424
00:24:52.861 --> 00:24:53.511
<v Speaker 3>And so you could say,</v>

425
00:24:53.511 --> 00:24:53.631
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

426
00:24:53.631 --> 00:24:57.710
<v Speaker 3>there's a very large set of possible hierarchies that you could end up in and</v>

427
00:24:57.711 --> 00:25:02.390
<v Speaker 3>you want to be armed with the right properties to navigate them on average,</v>

428
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:03.860
<v Speaker 3>the most effective way.</v>

429
00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:08.460
<v Speaker 3>And I think that our religious stories have evolved,</v>

430
00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:13.190
<v Speaker 3>the some of our stories have evolved to provide guidelines about how you would</v>

431
00:25:13.191 --> 00:25:17.330
<v Speaker 3>act if you were trying to optimize their performance across the seven possible</v>

432
00:25:17.331 --> 00:25:18.164
<v Speaker 3>hierarchies.</v>

433
00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:20.300
<v Speaker 3>And it isn't exactly what you'd expect.</v>

434
00:25:20.301 --> 00:25:21.620
<v Speaker 3>It's not brute force.</v>

435
00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:22.491
<v Speaker 3>It's something like,</v>

436
00:25:22.491 --> 00:25:22.701
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

437
00:25:22.701 --> 00:25:25.580
<v Speaker 3>I said it's something like stand up straight with your shoulders back at</v>

438
00:25:25.581 --> 00:25:27.920
<v Speaker 3>something like an attitude towards the world.</v>

439
00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:32.000
<v Speaker 3>And that attitude towards the world is one of courageous confrontation of what</v>

440
00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:33.290
<v Speaker 3>is coming at you.</v>

441
00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:36.440
<v Speaker 3>And the posture is part of that because this is a defensive crouch,</v>

442
00:25:36.441 --> 00:25:36.950
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

443
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:41.390
<v Speaker 3>This is a defeated posture and that's not an effective way of negotiating</v>

444
00:25:41.391 --> 00:25:43.290
<v Speaker 3>hierarchies parked because it's,</v>

445
00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:43.750
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

446
00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:44.330
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

447
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:44.770
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

448
00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:46.520
<v Speaker 3>it's a shying away from the world.</v>

449
00:25:46.521 --> 00:25:49.400
<v Speaker 3>And I understand that people have reason to shut away from the world.</v>

450
00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:51.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm perfectly aware of that,</v>

451
00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:52.340
<v Speaker 3>but that's not the point.</v>

452
00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:54.290
<v Speaker 3>The point is is that if you,</v>

453
00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:58.940
<v Speaker 3>if you want to optimize the probability that your life will turn out well,</v>

454
00:25:59.000 --> 00:25:59.690
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

455
00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:04.690
<v Speaker 3>you absorber the catastrophe and you stand up straight and you make yourself</v>

456
00:26:05.661 --> 00:26:08.210
<v Speaker 3>vulnerable because that's part of what you do when you stand up straight because</v>

457
00:26:08.211 --> 00:26:12.950
<v Speaker 3>you're exposing yourself to the world and you take on the catastrophe and the</v>

458
00:26:12.951 --> 00:26:16.340
<v Speaker 3>responsibility that goes along with it and that's by no means the same as</v>

459
00:26:16.341 --> 00:26:20.630
<v Speaker 3>becoming the most powerful person you can so you can thrash the competition and</v>

460
00:26:20.631 --> 00:26:21.050
<v Speaker 3>struggle.</v>

461
00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:23.150
<v Speaker 3>You're waiting to talk in a power oriented,</v>

462
00:26:23.151 --> 00:26:23.551
<v Speaker 3>dominant,</v>

463
00:26:23.551 --> 00:26:26.000
<v Speaker 3>tired that's not on the same story,</v>

464
00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:31.450
<v Speaker 3>but the people who are reading that who are attempting to criticize me only see</v>

465
00:26:31.551 --> 00:26:36.380
<v Speaker 3>the world through that lens and so when they read something about about</v>

466
00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:38.990
<v Speaker 3>alternative pathways to success,</v>

467
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:42.230
<v Speaker 3>which would be accepting responsibility and also accepting your own</v>

468
00:26:42.231 --> 00:26:45.190
<v Speaker 3>vulnerability and also accepting the catastrophe of tragedy.</v>

469
00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:46.280
<v Speaker 3>You've lightened again,</v>

470
00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:47.570
<v Speaker 3>read it any other way that well,</v>

471
00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:50.400
<v Speaker 3>he must be trying to train many targets like,</v>

472
00:26:50.401 --> 00:26:50.611
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

473
00:26:50.611 --> 00:26:51.540
<v Speaker 3>that's just not right.</v>

474
00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:54.680
<v Speaker 3>It's thing isn't even close to what I,</v>

475
00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:58.440
<v Speaker 3>what I wrote or what have you been attempting to communicate with people.</v>

476
00:26:58.500 --> 00:26:59.490
<v Speaker 3>So that's one.</v>

477
00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:04.830
<v Speaker 3>So rule two and three I'm going to talk about at the same time to rule two is</v>

478
00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:08.040
<v Speaker 3>treat yourself like you're someone you're responsible for helping.</v>

479
00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:12.390
<v Speaker 3>And rule three is make friends with the people who want the best for you.</v>

480
00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:14.520
<v Speaker 3>And those kind of make a set.</v>

481
00:27:14.521 --> 00:27:15.480
<v Speaker 3>I would say,</v>

482
00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:16.523
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

483
00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:20.880
<v Speaker 3>the other comment that people who've been credit structuring my writing say</v>

484
00:27:20.881 --> 00:27:21.420
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>

485
00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:22.620
<v Speaker 3>have put forward,</v>

486
00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:23.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm not complaining about this,</v>

487
00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:25.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm merely observing it,</v>

488
00:27:25.201 --> 00:27:28.230
<v Speaker 3>is that the rules are self evident and it's like,</v>

489
00:27:28.231 --> 00:27:28.800
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

490
00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.510
<v Speaker 3>it's not like I didn't know that when I wrote</v>

491
00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:33.850
<v Speaker 3>my point point,</v>

492
00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:38.930
<v Speaker 3>my whole point was to take things that were true is in the sand and think about</v>

493
00:27:39.151 --> 00:27:42.000
<v Speaker 3>truisms is that they're actually true.</v>

494
00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:42.990
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing,</v>

495
00:27:42.991 --> 00:27:43.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

496
00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:44.850
<v Speaker 3>they're universally accepted.</v>

497
00:27:44.851 --> 00:27:45.930
<v Speaker 3>Their proverbial let's say,</v>

498
00:27:45.931 --> 00:27:50.220
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't mean we don't forget why they're true or the or the now and</v>

499
00:27:50.221 --> 00:27:51.120
<v Speaker 3>then because they're true,</v>

500
00:27:51.121 --> 00:27:55.500
<v Speaker 3>they fallen on deaf ears and you need to go reinvestigate the structures</v>

501
00:27:55.501 --> 00:27:56.131
<v Speaker 3>underneath that.</v>

502
00:27:56.131 --> 00:27:59.910
<v Speaker 3>Make them true so that you can understand that so that you can see them with new</v>

503
00:27:59.911 --> 00:28:02.970
<v Speaker 3>eyes and so that's what I was trying to do and say,</v>

504
00:28:02.971 --> 00:28:04.500
<v Speaker 3>look what these things are.</v>

505
00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:09.420
<v Speaker 3>The reasons that these things happened to be the case to to treat yourself like</v>

506
00:28:09.421 --> 00:28:11.400
<v Speaker 3>you have someone responsible for helping,</v>

507
00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:12.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

508
00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:17.450
<v Speaker 3>that's actually not a simple thing because it isn't exactly self evident that</v>

509
00:28:18.961 --> 00:28:20.220
<v Speaker 3>people liked themselves.</v>

510
00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:21.060
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

511
00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:23.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's some people you like and something that you disliked.</v>

512
00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:26.910
<v Speaker 3>That's generally the case and some people just like almost everyone and some</v>

513
00:28:26.911 --> 00:28:28.210
<v Speaker 3>people like mobiles never went.</v>

514
00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:29.700
<v Speaker 3>It's a temperamental issue,</v>

515
00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:32.010
<v Speaker 3>but as you might think,</v>

516
00:28:32.011 --> 00:28:35.010
<v Speaker 3>well people are basically narcissistic and they liked themselves better than</v>

517
00:28:35.011 --> 00:28:37.680
<v Speaker 3>they like anyone else and I don't think that's the case.</v>

518
00:28:37.681 --> 00:28:38.191
<v Speaker 3>It's not been.</v>

519
00:28:38.191 --> 00:28:41.180
<v Speaker 3>My experience with people certainly hasn't been my clinical experiences.</v>

520
00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:45.240
<v Speaker 3>My experience has been that because people are more aware because individuals</v>

521
00:28:45.241 --> 00:28:47.070
<v Speaker 3>are more aware of their own flaws,</v>

522
00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:52.350
<v Speaker 3>that then they are aware of the flaws of anyone else excluding the narcissists.</v>

523
00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:54.750
<v Speaker 3>They actually tend to be pretty damn hard on themselves.</v>

524
00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:59.400
<v Speaker 3>I opened chapter two by describing the fact that the typical person,</v>

525
00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:03.210
<v Speaker 3>if a typical person takes their dog to a vet and the vet prescribes the</v>

526
00:29:03.211 --> 00:29:04.044
<v Speaker 3>medication,</v>

527
00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:07.260
<v Speaker 3>the typical person will give their dog of the medication,</v>

528
00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:10.260
<v Speaker 3>but if they go to a doctor and get a medication,</v>

529
00:29:10.261 --> 00:29:13.620
<v Speaker 3>then the third of them won't fill the prescription and half of the remaining</v>

530
00:29:13.621 --> 00:29:16.750
<v Speaker 3>third won't take your prescription and you might think,</v>

531
00:29:16.751 --> 00:29:17.970
<v Speaker 3>well that's just carelessness.</v>

532
00:29:17.971 --> 00:29:18.301
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

533
00:29:18.301 --> 00:29:18.511
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

534
00:29:18.511 --> 00:29:18.691
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

535
00:29:18.691 --> 00:29:19.590
<v Speaker 3>it's not because you,</v>

536
00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:19.960
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

537
00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:20.310
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

538
00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:22.470
<v Speaker 3>you won't do that for your dog.</v>

539
00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:26.440
<v Speaker 3>And then one of the conclusions you can draw from that and said people actually</v>

540
00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:28.290
<v Speaker 3>like their dog more than they like themselves.</v>

541
00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.510
<v Speaker 3>And I actually think that's generally true.</v>

542
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.931
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

543
00:29:30.931 --> 00:29:34.730
<v Speaker 3>people are pretty wholeheartedly affectionate white would they have a dog</v>

544
00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:35.191
<v Speaker 3>otherwise?</v>

545
00:29:35.191 --> 00:29:35.371
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

546
00:29:35.371 --> 00:29:37.590
<v Speaker 3>But their whole heartedly affectionate with the dog.</v>

547
00:29:37.591 --> 00:29:38.970
<v Speaker 3>It's just a damn dog.</v>

548
00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:41.230
<v Speaker 3>And if there's anything wrong with dogs,</v>

549
00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:48.270
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't mean they would extend the season itself.</v>

550
00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:51.780
<v Speaker 3>And I think what you're producing is it is a,</v>

551
00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:54.070
<v Speaker 3>an explanation of why that's a bad idea.</v>

552
00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:57.220
<v Speaker 3>It's a bad idea not to treat yourself property.</v>

553
00:29:57.230 --> 00:30:01.990
<v Speaker 3>And so the idea is that perhaps you have a moral obligation to treat yourself</v>

554
00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:05.670
<v Speaker 3>properly as if you or someone you were responsible for helping,</v>

555
00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:06.281
<v Speaker 3>you might take more.</v>

556
00:30:06.281 --> 00:30:09.070
<v Speaker 3>What's the right frame of mind for that?</v>

557
00:30:09.071 --> 00:30:09.611
<v Speaker 3>That I can say,</v>

558
00:30:09.611 --> 00:30:09.791
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

559
00:30:09.791 --> 00:30:12.700
<v Speaker 3>imagine if you have a child who's wellbeing,</v>

560
00:30:12.701 --> 00:30:14.410
<v Speaker 3>you are actually responsible for it.</v>

561
00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:19.180
<v Speaker 3>It's not that hard to imagine now in and then you're the appropriate thing for</v>

562
00:30:19.181 --> 00:30:23.320
<v Speaker 3>you to do as a civilized and responsible human being is to do everything you can</v>

563
00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:26.400
<v Speaker 3>to help that child to encourage the child because that's.</v>

564
00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:27.700
<v Speaker 3>That's the right phrase.</v>

565
00:30:27.701 --> 00:30:32.701
<v Speaker 3>If you had to boil down what you should do with the child into one word</v>

566
00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:38.040
<v Speaker 3>encourages a really good work and to encourage the child is to instill in them</v>

567
00:30:38.201 --> 00:30:40.820
<v Speaker 3>that sense that they're fundamentally.</v>

568
00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:44.470
<v Speaker 3>It's a fundamentally worthwhile endeavor for them to take their proper place in</v>

569
00:30:44.471 --> 00:30:49.471
<v Speaker 3>the world and also to recognize both implicitly and explicitly that there is</v>

570
00:30:49.961 --> 00:30:53.920
<v Speaker 3>something that the child brings to the world that only that child and bring into</v>

571
00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:56.260
<v Speaker 3>the world would be a lesser place without it.</v>

572
00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:58.540
<v Speaker 3>And that's really what it means to have faith in someone.</v>

573
00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.830
<v Speaker 3>And it's necessary to have that sort of faith in yourself and,</v>

574
00:31:01.831 --> 00:31:04.040
<v Speaker 3>and I need an ID detached way.</v>

575
00:31:05.090 --> 00:31:09.160
<v Speaker 3>It's in the same way that maybe the presumption of innocence would apply to you,</v>

576
00:31:09.161 --> 00:31:12.340
<v Speaker 3>which is a good thing to know innocent before proven guilty.</v>

577
00:31:12.341 --> 00:31:17.341
<v Speaker 3>It's a lovely rule of thumb and the idea that because human beings have</v>

578
00:31:18.071 --> 00:31:19.210
<v Speaker 3>intrinsic value,</v>

579
00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:22.240
<v Speaker 3>which is the cornerstone of our entire social system,</v>

580
00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:23.290
<v Speaker 3>our legal system,</v>

581
00:31:23.291 --> 00:31:24.190
<v Speaker 3>our economic system,</v>

582
00:31:24.191 --> 00:31:27.340
<v Speaker 3>it's the fundamental cornerstone that the same thing applies to you.</v>

583
00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:30.070
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't really matter whether you lightened yourself or not.</v>

584
00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:31.000
<v Speaker 3>That's not the point.</v>

585
00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:34.840
<v Speaker 3>The point is that independent of your knowledge of your own flaws,</v>

586
00:31:34.841 --> 00:31:36.790
<v Speaker 3>which are no don't matter for you,</v>

587
00:31:36.791 --> 00:31:40.720
<v Speaker 3>have a responsibility to do everything you can so that the basket you can</v>

588
00:31:40.721 --> 00:31:43.000
<v Speaker 3>flourish in the best possible way in the world.</v>

589
00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:47.620
<v Speaker 3>And so that's what chapter two is about in chapter three is an extension of that</v>

590
00:31:47.621 --> 00:31:48.880
<v Speaker 3>to the social world.</v>

591
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.170
<v Speaker 3>I could've written it.</v>

592
00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:51.010
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

593
00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:55.360
<v Speaker 3>there's this psychologist named Carl Rogers who I really like and Rogers has</v>

594
00:31:55.361 --> 00:31:58.600
<v Speaker 3>written some great things which I'll refer to later on,</v>

595
00:31:58.601 --> 00:32:00.000
<v Speaker 3>listening to really,</v>

596
00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:03.250
<v Speaker 3>really practical advice and practical advice.</v>

597
00:32:03.251 --> 00:32:06.610
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to become point right because most things are so abstracted life that</v>

598
00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:09.400
<v Speaker 3>you can't just can't and you like a guidebook and say,</v>

599
00:32:09.401 --> 00:32:09.580
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

600
00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:10.960
<v Speaker 3>follow this and it's gonna work out,</v>

601
00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:14.980
<v Speaker 3>but Rogers has done a nice job with that with regards to listening and I'll tell</v>

602
00:32:14.981 --> 00:32:16.000
<v Speaker 3>you about that later,</v>

603
00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:20.200
<v Speaker 3>but Roger said that you should have unconditional positive regard for your</v>

604
00:32:20.201 --> 00:32:21.970
<v Speaker 3>clients if you're a therapist.</v>

605
00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:23.620
<v Speaker 3>I never really liked that.</v>

606
00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:28.180
<v Speaker 3>I always thought there was and behavioral analysis of Carl Rogers interactions</v>

607
00:32:28.181 --> 00:32:32.380
<v Speaker 3>with his clients indicated that he did follow that dictate</v>

608
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:40.430
<v Speaker 3>or Oregon or that it was an insufficiently sophisticated articulation of what he</v>

609
00:32:40.971 --> 00:32:41.781
<v Speaker 3>was actually doing.</v>

610
00:32:41.781 --> 00:32:45.320
<v Speaker 3>Which is a better way of thinking about when clients come to see me.</v>

611
00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:49.700
<v Speaker 3>What I think is I'm on the side of the part of you that wants the best for you</v>

612
00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:53.180
<v Speaker 3>and I have not at all on the side of you that wants death,</v>

613
00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:54.430
<v Speaker 3>destruction and or.</v>

614
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:57.260
<v Speaker 3>And there's definitely a part of you and that leads in that direction,</v>

615
00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:58.560
<v Speaker 3>and sometimes the snowbird,</v>

616
00:32:58.590 --> 00:32:58.781
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

617
00:32:58.781 --> 00:32:59.450
<v Speaker 3>we parked.</v>

618
00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:02.120
<v Speaker 3>That's the part that these you to do sell both destructive,</v>

619
00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:03.381
<v Speaker 3>despicable,</v>

620
00:33:03.381 --> 00:33:06.650
<v Speaker 3>reprehensible things or at least to contemplate doing that,</v>

621
00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.240
<v Speaker 3>but also to do the like,</v>

622
00:33:08.241 --> 00:33:09.950
<v Speaker 3>let's make no mistake about that.</v>

623
00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:15.020
<v Speaker 3>And so I would say that you want to make friends and this is a moral obligation.</v>

624
00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:15.830
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

625
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:18.470
<v Speaker 3>it goes along with the idea that there's something about you that's</v>

626
00:33:18.471 --> 00:33:19.790
<v Speaker 3>intrinsically valuable,</v>

627
00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:22.530
<v Speaker 3>that you have a responsibility to act property to,</v>

628
00:33:22.531 --> 00:33:25.370
<v Speaker 3>towards independently of your feelings about yourself.</v>

629
00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:26.750
<v Speaker 3>It's the same.</v>

630
00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:30.350
<v Speaker 3>The same thing occurs when it comes to surrounding yourself with people in your</v>

631
00:33:30.351 --> 00:33:31.184
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

632
00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:32.023
<v Speaker 3>You should be.</v>

633
00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:36.620
<v Speaker 3>You should take to yourself the right to choose the people around you,</v>

634
00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:37.191
<v Speaker 3>your friends,</v>

635
00:33:37.191 --> 00:33:39.830
<v Speaker 3>let's say who are happy,</v>

636
00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:42.470
<v Speaker 3>when good things have happened to you,</v>

637
00:33:42.650 --> 00:33:47.300
<v Speaker 3>genuinely happy and unhappy with bad things happen to you who are actually on</v>

638
00:33:47.301 --> 00:33:48.410
<v Speaker 3>your side.</v>

639
00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:52.250
<v Speaker 3>And if you have people around you that aren't like that,</v>

640
00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:57.470
<v Speaker 3>then you should seriously consider stepping away from them because you putting</v>

641
00:33:57.471 --> 00:34:01.700
<v Speaker 3>up with the fact that they're not like that is not in their best interests</v>

642
00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:02.330
<v Speaker 3>either.</v>

643
00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:04.070
<v Speaker 3>All you're doing is facilitating.</v>

644
00:34:04.071 --> 00:34:05.680
<v Speaker 3>They're acting in the world.</v>

645
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:09.410
<v Speaker 3>Have an attitude that's not good for them and not good for you and you might</v>

646
00:34:09.411 --> 00:34:09.730
<v Speaker 3>drink well.</v>

647
00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:13.070
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of harsh to walk away from people just because they don't treat you</v>

648
00:34:13.071 --> 00:34:13.700
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

649
00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:14.181
<v Speaker 3>I would say,</v>

650
00:34:14.181 --> 00:34:16.160
<v Speaker 3>well not the first time.</v>

651
00:34:16.161 --> 00:34:18.230
<v Speaker 3>They don't treat you well or not.</v>

652
00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:19.670
<v Speaker 3>When it's when it's you know,</v>

653
00:34:19.671 --> 00:34:20.750
<v Speaker 3>no one's perfect.</v>

654
00:34:20.751 --> 00:34:25.400
<v Speaker 3>There's going to be bumps and hills and dips and every relationship.</v>

655
00:34:25.401 --> 00:34:26.390
<v Speaker 3>That's not my point,</v>

656
00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:30.440
<v Speaker 3>but you know perfectly well the difference between someone who's actually on</v>

657
00:34:30.441 --> 00:34:35.441
<v Speaker 3>your site despite their faults and someone who who really isn't in that,</v>

658
00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:40.340
<v Speaker 3>in that latter category with people would be people who are pretty happy when</v>

659
00:34:40.341 --> 00:34:45.270
<v Speaker 3>you fail or don't even try because they're failing and not trying at.</v>

660
00:34:45.350 --> 00:34:46.610
<v Speaker 3>If you're doing it too,</v>

661
00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:51.110
<v Speaker 3>it's a hell of a lot easier on them and that's not a helpful situation and it's</v>

662
00:34:51.111 --> 00:34:53.150
<v Speaker 3>an extraordinarily common situation.</v>

663
00:34:53.390 --> 00:34:55.040
<v Speaker 3>It's even common within families.</v>

664
00:34:55.050 --> 00:34:55.211
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

665
00:34:55.211 --> 00:35:00.211
<v Speaker 3>I've seen plenty of situations where someone within a very dysfunctional family</v>

666
00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:03.500
<v Speaker 3>starts to try to put together,</v>

667
00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:03.801
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

668
00:35:03.801 --> 00:35:08.060
<v Speaker 3>in the small ways that they initially started at all they face from their family</v>

669
00:35:08.061 --> 00:35:09.830
<v Speaker 3>members is unbelievable.</v>

670
00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:14.830
<v Speaker 3>Bitter opposition to any viewed as arrogant attempt on the part of the person</v>

671
00:35:16.431 --> 00:35:19.380
<v Speaker 3>who's suffering to try to make things well.</v>

672
00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:23.960
<v Speaker 3>The little of that goes an awful long way and so well,</v>

673
00:35:23.961 --> 00:35:24.590
<v Speaker 3>so itself.</v>

674
00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:29.590
<v Speaker 3>Those two rules are are a a philosophical and psychological meditation on the</v>

675
00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:33.920
<v Speaker 3>the ethical obligation you have,</v>

676
00:35:33.921 --> 00:35:38.921
<v Speaker 3>not only to treat yourself as if you were somewhat intrinsic value and then</v>

677
00:35:39.110 --> 00:35:40.860
<v Speaker 3>we'll get into what that means later,</v>

678
00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:45.920
<v Speaker 3>but also to associate with people about who you feel the same way and feel and</v>

679
00:35:46.261 --> 00:35:48.600
<v Speaker 3>act out the same thing in relationship to you.</v>

680
00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:53.520
<v Speaker 3>It's the minimum that you should require of the people that you allow into your</v>

681
00:35:53.521 --> 00:35:55.790
<v Speaker 3>life and so that's cool.</v>

682
00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:02.470
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>

683
00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:05.100
<v Speaker 3>Aggressiveness is because</v>

684
00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:07.580
<v Speaker 3>some of you,</v>

685
00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:12.560
<v Speaker 3>some of you won't be able to lead this because you've been fortunate and I don't</v>

686
00:36:12.561 --> 00:36:13.394
<v Speaker 3>mean privileged,</v>

687
00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:14.320
<v Speaker 3>mean fortunate,</v>

688
00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:14.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

689
00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:16.190
<v Speaker 3>certain certainly terrible things happen,</v>

690
00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:16.940
<v Speaker 3>have you,</v>

691
00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:20.660
<v Speaker 3>but you have no idea how many people there are in the world who have never</v>

692
00:36:20.661 --> 00:36:25.661
<v Speaker 3>contemplated the idea that they might reasonably be able to make a choice about</v>

693
00:36:26.451 --> 00:36:29.390
<v Speaker 3>who they associate with in relationship to how they're being treated.</v>

694
00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:33.710
<v Speaker 3>They just never figured out without some okay thing for someone to do.</v>

695
00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:34.633
<v Speaker 3>You know what it's like.</v>

696
00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:37.640
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you a parallel example.</v>

697
00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:40.820
<v Speaker 3>Most people in my experience,</v>

698
00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:44.270
<v Speaker 3>and this is people including my students at the University of Toronto,</v>

699
00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:46.220
<v Speaker 3>are pretty high functioning kids.</v>

700
00:36:46.221 --> 00:36:47.180
<v Speaker 3>All things considered,</v>

701
00:36:47.181 --> 00:36:48.650
<v Speaker 3>they've been academically successful.</v>

702
00:36:48.651 --> 00:36:49.910
<v Speaker 3>Most of them are quite hard to repeat.</v>

703
00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:53.960
<v Speaker 3>The vast majority of them are children of first generation immigrants and they</v>

704
00:36:53.961 --> 00:36:54.860
<v Speaker 3>have that,</v>

705
00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:55.191
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

706
00:36:55.191 --> 00:36:56.720
<v Speaker 3>that drive to succeed.</v>

707
00:36:56.720 --> 00:37:00.450
<v Speaker 3>That comes along with having parents who sacrificed a hell of a lot to get you a</v>

708
00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:03.500
<v Speaker 3>university and they're hoping for good things for you and all of that.</v>

709
00:37:03.610 --> 00:37:04.850
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

710
00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:08.720
<v Speaker 3>one of the things I found with them is that despite them being in that</v>

711
00:37:08.721 --> 00:37:09.554
<v Speaker 3>situation,</v>

712
00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:10.640
<v Speaker 3>very few of them,</v>

713
00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:15.670
<v Speaker 3>by the time they were 21 or 22 had add ever formulated anything approximating a</v>

714
00:37:15.681 --> 00:37:19.880
<v Speaker 3>conscious life plan associated say with the development of their own character,</v>

715
00:37:19.881 --> 00:37:24.100
<v Speaker 3>which points to a staggering shortcoming in an educational system of,</v>

716
00:37:24.110 --> 00:37:27.890
<v Speaker 3>of a magnitude that absolutely can comprehensible once you start to think about</v>

717
00:37:27.891 --> 00:37:28.310
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

718
00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:29.330
<v Speaker 3>but by the same token,</v>

719
00:37:29.331 --> 00:37:33.980
<v Speaker 3>so they've never thought about the fact that they could craft their life in some</v>

720
00:37:33.981 --> 00:37:34.814
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>

721
00:37:34.930 --> 00:37:35.241
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

722
00:37:35.241 --> 00:37:38.120
<v Speaker 3>that they can think about their friendships and their intimate relationships in</v>

723
00:37:38.121 --> 00:37:40.420
<v Speaker 3>their use of time outside of work and and,</v>

724
00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:41.170
<v Speaker 3>and their,</v>

725
00:37:41.170 --> 00:37:42.170
<v Speaker 3>their reactors,</v>

726
00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:44.690
<v Speaker 3>the reaction temptation and how they would treat,</v>

727
00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:47.060
<v Speaker 3>how they would take care of themselves mentally and physically.</v>

728
00:37:47.061 --> 00:37:48.380
<v Speaker 3>There's never been a conscious.</v>

729
00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:53.090
<v Speaker 3>Things are just happening to them instead of the crafting up a plan and a</v>

730
00:37:53.091 --> 00:37:54.230
<v Speaker 3>strategy for their life.</v>

731
00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:55.730
<v Speaker 3>And by the same token,</v>

732
00:37:56.390 --> 00:38:00.410
<v Speaker 3>they have thought consciously about a strategy for their social being.</v>

733
00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:02.300
<v Speaker 3>It's just never come up as an issue,</v>

734
00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:03.620
<v Speaker 3>but it can come up.</v>

735
00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:07.370
<v Speaker 3>And why would you not surrounding yourself with people who actually want the</v>

736
00:38:07.371 --> 00:38:08.210
<v Speaker 3>best for you?</v>

737
00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:08.721
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

738
00:38:08.721 --> 00:38:09.830
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you one reason.</v>

739
00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:15.680
<v Speaker 2>What</v>

740
00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:18.620
<v Speaker 3>reason would you don't want to birth yourself the responsibility.</v>

741
00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:20.870
<v Speaker 3>That's the underground reasons to say,</v>

742
00:38:20.871 --> 00:38:23.860
<v Speaker 3>well why would he put up with people who don't want the best for you is,</v>

743
00:38:23.861 --> 00:38:23.981
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

744
00:38:23.981 --> 00:38:25.640
<v Speaker 3>they don't make much of a demand on you.</v>

745
00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:26.271
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

746
00:38:26.271 --> 00:38:29.870
<v Speaker 3>So if you're just like limping along through life bitter and resentful and</v>

747
00:38:29.871 --> 00:38:32.540
<v Speaker 3>you're not putting your best foot forward so to speak,</v>

748
00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:34.070
<v Speaker 3>they'll forgive you for that.</v>

749
00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:37.660
<v Speaker 3>But I wouldn't really that as an indication of the fact that they care for you.</v>

750
00:38:37.661 --> 00:38:40.600
<v Speaker 3>I would regard that as an indication of the fact that they're looking for an</v>

751
00:38:40.601 --> 00:38:44.400
<v Speaker 3>excuse to continue doing exactly the same things itself and none of that's</v>

752
00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:45.950
<v Speaker 3>positive and none of it's health clinic.</v>

753
00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:49.780
<v Speaker 3>Every good that has dreadful medium to longterm consequences.</v>

754
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:51.340
<v Speaker 3>So it's not a recommendation.</v>

755
00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:53.190
<v Speaker 3>It's not a pathway or recommend</v>

756
00:38:55.180 --> 00:39:00.180
<v Speaker 3>rule for comparing yourself to who you were yesterday instead of to whom someone</v>

757
00:39:02.741 --> 00:39:04.120
<v Speaker 3>else's today.</v>

758
00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:04.721
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

759
00:39:04.721 --> 00:39:05.554
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

760
00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:06.980
<v Speaker 3>back to the hierarchy idea.</v>

761
00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:08.770
<v Speaker 3>So we've already decided.</v>

762
00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:09.873
<v Speaker 3>I say,</v>

763
00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:14.410
<v Speaker 3>I think this is a solid proposition that if you're going to move forward in</v>

764
00:39:14.411 --> 00:39:14.860
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>

765
00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:18.550
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be inside of hierarchy and the hierarchy comes with the risk of</v>

766
00:39:18.551 --> 00:39:19.780
<v Speaker 3>failure and success.</v>

767
00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:21.340
<v Speaker 3>And so what that means is,</v>

768
00:39:21.370 --> 00:39:22.720
<v Speaker 3>and this isn't the eternal truth,</v>

769
00:39:22.721 --> 00:39:23.920
<v Speaker 3>it's a mythological truth,</v>

770
00:39:23.921 --> 00:39:27.280
<v Speaker 3>which is why hierarchies are represented in mythological stories,</v>

771
00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:31.500
<v Speaker 3>often outside tyrants or canes or some figure of power.</v>

772
00:39:31.570 --> 00:39:34.720
<v Speaker 3>You're in a hierarchy and because of that you're subject to the pressure of</v>

773
00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:39.370
<v Speaker 3>success and failure and to some degree you might succeed it to some degree.</v>

774
00:39:39.371 --> 00:39:40.204
<v Speaker 3>You might fail.</v>

775
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:40.781
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

776
00:39:40.781 --> 00:39:44.140
<v Speaker 3>if you compare yourself to other people out there in the world,</v>

777
00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:46.900
<v Speaker 3>especially in our hyper connected world,</v>

778
00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:51.520
<v Speaker 3>it's easy to be bitter about your relative lack of success.</v>

779
00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:53.200
<v Speaker 3>And I don't care a lot more dimension.</v>

780
00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:54.430
<v Speaker 3>I don't care who you are.</v>

781
00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:58.060
<v Speaker 3>There's someone better looking at you that you know about baby.</v>

782
00:39:58.061 --> 00:39:59.380
<v Speaker 3>That's a celebrity type.</v>

783
00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:00.110
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

784
00:40:00.110 --> 00:40:01.960
<v Speaker 3>we might want to compare yourself to and,</v>

785
00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:07.100
<v Speaker 3>and maybe like you're doing midland well on the whole seven dimensions of</v>

786
00:40:07.121 --> 00:40:09.090
<v Speaker 3>comparison to perhaps you know,</v>

787
00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:09.570
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

788
00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:12.850
<v Speaker 3>and it's easy to become better as a consequence of that.</v>

789
00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:17.910
<v Speaker 3>It's an illusion in some sense though because it truly is an illusion,</v>

790
00:40:18.071 --> 00:40:20.770
<v Speaker 3>like I've had people in my clinical practice,</v>

791
00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:26.050
<v Speaker 3>my breakfast across the entire spectrum of human ability from people who are</v>

792
00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:29.770
<v Speaker 3>sufficiently intellectually impaired and socially impaired so that it was</v>

793
00:40:29.771 --> 00:40:33.820
<v Speaker 3>impossible for them to learn how to fold envelopes in a volunteer position and</v>

794
00:40:33.821 --> 00:40:34.654
<v Speaker 3>the charity.</v>

795
00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:39.780
<v Speaker 3>So that would be the low functional end to people who run like unbelievably</v>

796
00:40:40.181 --> 00:40:44.920
<v Speaker 3>successful organizations under unbelievably difficult conditions for very long</v>

797
00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:46.540
<v Speaker 3>periods of time in a very honorable man.</v>

798
00:40:46.541 --> 00:40:48.430
<v Speaker 3>And so really the entire spectrum.</v>

799
00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:53.140
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things I've learned from doing that is that people are bloody</v>

800
00:40:53.141 --> 00:40:58.141
<v Speaker 3>complicated and just because just because they're successful at one on one</v>

801
00:40:58.811 --> 00:41:03.480
<v Speaker 3>dimension doesn't mean that their lives are all rosy and perfect along every</v>

802
00:41:03.481 --> 00:41:04.060
<v Speaker 3>dimension.</v>

803
00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:04.270
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

804
00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:04.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

805
00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:07.210
<v Speaker 3>what are the most successful people that I dealt with?</v>

806
00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:11.560
<v Speaker 3>Someone I really admired and respected who did everything he could during the</v>

807
00:41:11.561 --> 00:41:14.500
<v Speaker 3>time we work together to get is moderately sized,</v>

808
00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:19.560
<v Speaker 3>successful business running just as perfectly as it possibly could for his</v>

809
00:41:20.471 --> 00:41:20.891
<v Speaker 3>benefit,</v>

810
00:41:20.891 --> 00:41:25.390
<v Speaker 3>but also to a substantial degree for the benefit of the people that he was</v>

811
00:41:25.391 --> 00:41:26.080
<v Speaker 3>training.</v>

812
00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:30.310
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that people often aren't credited with if they're successful</v>

813
00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.830
<v Speaker 3>is their desire to help other people become successful.</v>

814
00:41:32.850 --> 00:41:33.050
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

815
00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:33.490
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

816
00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:36.490
<v Speaker 3>if you listen to the standard Marxist trope,</v>

817
00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:41.560
<v Speaker 3>you'd assume that everyone who's climbed to the top about competence hierarchy</v>

818
00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:45.120
<v Speaker 3>is has a baseball bat with a nail in it can anytime everybody,</v>

819
00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:48.110
<v Speaker 3>anybody sticks off an arm trying to also get get up.</v>

820
00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:51.710
<v Speaker 3>The rung me just nailed them with it and it's just nothing can be farther from</v>

821
00:41:51.711 --> 00:41:52.131
<v Speaker 3>the truth.</v>

822
00:41:52.131 --> 00:41:52.640
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

823
00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:55.970
<v Speaker 3>the people that I've met and been really successful are so damn happy when they</v>

824
00:41:55.971 --> 00:41:57.770
<v Speaker 3>can find someone else who's young,</v>

825
00:41:57.771 --> 00:41:58.640
<v Speaker 3>who's competent,</v>

826
00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:01.610
<v Speaker 3>who wants things to be good that they can lend to after that,</v>

827
00:42:01.611 --> 00:42:02.444
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

828
00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:02.811
<v Speaker 3>It isn't.</v>

829
00:42:02.811 --> 00:42:04.670
<v Speaker 3>Even if they're doing it for altruistic reasons.</v>

830
00:42:04.671 --> 00:42:05.241
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

831
00:42:05.241 --> 00:42:10.241
<v Speaker 3>It's the one of the pleasures of be in a position of authority when you have</v>

832
00:42:11.301 --> 00:42:16.301
<v Speaker 3>some spare capacity is that you can help other people build their lives and it's</v>

833
00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:17.510
<v Speaker 3>it's</v>

834
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:18.343
<v Speaker 2>you</v>

835
00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:26.780
<v Speaker 2>have any sense at all,</v>

836
00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:28.610
<v Speaker 3>really shallow,</v>

837
00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:31.370
<v Speaker 3>quite to a quite psychopathic degree,</v>

838
00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:32.870
<v Speaker 3>that it's much more.</v>

839
00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:33.913
<v Speaker 3>That's a,</v>

840
00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:38.840
<v Speaker 3>that's a source of much more deep pleasure and engagement than the money that</v>

841
00:42:38.841 --> 00:42:39.674
<v Speaker 3>you're making.</v>

842
00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:42.320
<v Speaker 3>It's not like there's anything against money.</v>

843
00:42:42.321 --> 00:42:43.790
<v Speaker 3>Money is extraordinarily useful,</v>

844
00:42:43.791 --> 00:42:46.190
<v Speaker 3>but to think of that as the only,</v>

845
00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:48.940
<v Speaker 3>the only motivation for,</v>

846
00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:53.390
<v Speaker 3>for successful people's pursuit of their success and then to assume that that's</v>

847
00:42:53.391 --> 00:42:55.800
<v Speaker 3>the only form of reward that they get from their success.</v>

848
00:42:55.801 --> 00:43:00.801
<v Speaker 3>It's so bloody narrow minded and unidimensional that it almost the gardens</v>

849
00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:02.360
<v Speaker 3>belief that people can,</v>

850
00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:06.290
<v Speaker 3>can assume that it's like they never met anyone who was actually successful.</v>

851
00:43:06.291 --> 00:43:09.350
<v Speaker 3>I certainly haven't met in a reasonable number of them.</v>

852
00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:10.483
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

853
00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:11.601
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

854
00:43:11.601 --> 00:43:12.340
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

855
00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:13.790
<v Speaker 3>so we have a problem.</v>

856
00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:14.780
<v Speaker 3>There's hierarchies in.</v>

857
00:43:14.781 --> 00:43:18.260
<v Speaker 3>There are people who are more successful than you on any dimension that you</v>

858
00:43:18.261 --> 00:43:19.520
<v Speaker 3>could manage and you might think,</v>

859
00:43:19.521 --> 00:43:19.970
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

860
00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:20.600
<v Speaker 3>how.</v>

861
00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:24.470
<v Speaker 3>The problem with that is it can make you bitter and it's a real problem.</v>

862
00:43:24.471 --> 00:43:24.741
<v Speaker 3>You think,</v>

863
00:43:24.741 --> 00:43:24.861
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

864
00:43:24.861 --> 00:43:26.210
<v Speaker 3>the world is unfair.</v>

865
00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:26.481
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

866
00:43:26.481 --> 00:43:27.050
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

867
00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:31.730
<v Speaker 3>if you had a sentence and if you took a particular successful person and you get</v>

868
00:43:31.731 --> 00:43:34.310
<v Speaker 3>a multidimensional analysis of their life,</v>

869
00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:38.060
<v Speaker 3>you find that of the seven major dimensions of life,</v>

870
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:39.830
<v Speaker 3>so intimate relationships,</v>

871
00:43:39.831 --> 00:43:41.430
<v Speaker 3>family time,</v>

872
00:43:41.490 --> 00:43:42.050
<v Speaker 3>use of time,</v>

873
00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:43.250
<v Speaker 3>outside of work,</v>

874
00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:44.600
<v Speaker 3>educational status,</v>

875
00:43:44.601 --> 00:43:45.434
<v Speaker 3>health,</v>

876
00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:46.100
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

877
00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:50.360
<v Speaker 3>resistance to temptation to say there might be one or two others,</v>

878
00:43:50.361 --> 00:43:54.560
<v Speaker 3>but you kind of get the idea that those people who are successful are suffering</v>

879
00:43:54.561 --> 00:43:56.810
<v Speaker 3>pretty dreadfully on at least one of those dimensions.</v>

880
00:43:56.811 --> 00:43:57.770
<v Speaker 3>And sometimes more,</v>

881
00:43:58.070 --> 00:43:58.431
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

882
00:43:58.431 --> 00:44:00.220
<v Speaker 3>and maybe they're doing well in their business,</v>

883
00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:03.290
<v Speaker 3>but they haven't extremely ill first degree relative.</v>

884
00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:07.580
<v Speaker 3>And that means both many people have an extremely ill first degree relative,</v>

885
00:44:07.581 --> 00:44:07.761
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

886
00:44:07.761 --> 00:44:11.840
<v Speaker 3>It's part of life or maybe they're married is shaky or maybe they have a habit</v>

887
00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:16.580
<v Speaker 3>of like a drug or alcohol habit that they're having a bitch of the time I'm</v>

888
00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:17.270
<v Speaker 3>dealing with.</v>

889
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:19.790
<v Speaker 3>Or they had a bad history of abuse when they were children.</v>

890
00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:20.713
<v Speaker 3>There's some,</v>

891
00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:23.180
<v Speaker 3>there's at least one or two things about delight,</v>

892
00:44:23.181 --> 00:44:26.030
<v Speaker 3>ones that are truly tragic and often far more than one.</v>

893
00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:27.440
<v Speaker 3>So when you meet these people,</v>

894
00:44:27.441 --> 00:44:27.771
<v Speaker 3>you think,</v>

895
00:44:27.771 --> 00:44:28.401
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

896
00:44:28.401 --> 00:44:33.401
<v Speaker 3>it's absolutely a miracle that you're successful given you're stumbling forward</v>

897
00:44:33.871 --> 00:44:34.440
<v Speaker 3>with it.</v>

898
00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:34.831
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

899
00:44:34.831 --> 00:44:35.400
<v Speaker 3>if you.</v>

900
00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:38.940
<v Speaker 3>If you buy into the critical Marxist approach,</v>

901
00:44:38.941 --> 00:44:39.774
<v Speaker 3>you think that,</v>

902
00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:40.450
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

903
00:44:40.450 --> 00:44:44.070
<v Speaker 3>there was this one percent of the people who dominate everything that's good in</v>

904
00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:46.200
<v Speaker 3>everything about life is absolutely rosy.</v>

905
00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:50.160
<v Speaker 3>It's like they live in some sort of glass bowl paradise that the rest of us are</v>

906
00:44:50.161 --> 00:44:53.400
<v Speaker 3>completely excluded from because those people exist.</v>

907
00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:54.121
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

908
00:44:54.121 --> 00:44:54.271
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

909
00:44:54.271 --> 00:44:55.770
<v Speaker 3>if you meet people who are successful,</v>

910
00:44:55.771 --> 00:44:56.604
<v Speaker 3>you think,</v>

911
00:44:56.780 --> 00:44:56.920
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

912
00:44:56.920 --> 00:45:01.920
<v Speaker 3>that's actually kind of sad in some sense because what you see is the economic</v>

913
00:45:02.341 --> 00:45:03.174
<v Speaker 3>success.</v>

914
00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:07.230
<v Speaker 3>Although it's nothing to be trivialized and certainly beats the hell out of the</v>

915
00:45:07.231 --> 00:45:08.070
<v Speaker 3>alternative.</v>

916
00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:09.120
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

917
00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:13.980
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't relatively feeble job of protecting you from the fundamental</v>

918
00:45:13.981 --> 00:45:14.980
<v Speaker 3>catastrophes of like,</v>

919
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:19.380
<v Speaker 3>and that's too bad in some sense because wouldn't it be lovely if you could be</v>

920
00:45:19.381 --> 00:45:23.970
<v Speaker 3>economically successful and then you were far distant from any sort of</v>

921
00:45:23.971 --> 00:45:25.260
<v Speaker 3>catastrophe or tragedy,</v>

922
00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:26.303
<v Speaker 3>but you're not.</v>

923
00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:28.890
<v Speaker 3>Now that doesn't mean you're not from buffer and thanked me because otherwise,</v>

924
00:45:28.891 --> 00:45:31.110
<v Speaker 3>why the hell would we have an economic system at all?</v>

925
00:45:31.111 --> 00:45:31.321
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

926
00:45:31.321 --> 00:45:35.760
<v Speaker 3>The whole point of the economic system is to fight for you against catastrophe.</v>

927
00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:38.510
<v Speaker 3>But so,</v>

928
00:45:38.511 --> 00:45:38.900
<v Speaker 3>so it's,</v>

929
00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:39.210
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

930
00:45:39.210 --> 00:45:41.290
<v Speaker 3>it's a mistake to be envious say,</v>

931
00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:43.400
<v Speaker 3>because what it means is that you're,</v>

932
00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:46.050
<v Speaker 3>you're looking at someone through their very narrow lens,</v>

933
00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:50.370
<v Speaker 3>you're elevating them above you on that particular dimension of comparison and</v>

934
00:45:50.371 --> 00:45:51.570
<v Speaker 3>you're demeaning yourself.</v>

935
00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:52.710
<v Speaker 3>And so technically it's a,</v>

936
00:45:52.770 --> 00:45:53.600
<v Speaker 3>it's a mistake,</v>

937
00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:55.470
<v Speaker 3>which is why I think envy is a real mistake.</v>

938
00:45:55.471 --> 00:45:55.711
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

939
00:45:55.711 --> 00:45:56.544
<v Speaker 3>what am I helping you know,</v>

940
00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:57.420
<v Speaker 3>the person,</v>

941
00:45:57.420 --> 00:45:58.590
<v Speaker 3>unless they have to be very,</v>

942
00:45:58.591 --> 00:45:59.570
<v Speaker 3>very close to you,</v>

943
00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:00.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

944
00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:01.080
<v Speaker 3>what do you know about their life?</v>

945
00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:01.411
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

946
00:46:01.411 --> 00:46:01.711
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>

947
00:46:01.711 --> 00:46:03.540
<v Speaker 3>don't lead to conclusions here.</v>

948
00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:06.840
<v Speaker 3>It isn't obvious to think about you have a class on every possible dimension.</v>

949
00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:09.360
<v Speaker 3>And even if they do well,</v>

950
00:46:09.361 --> 00:46:11.070
<v Speaker 3>that might mean you have something to learn.</v>

951
00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:15.600
<v Speaker 3>And it might also mean that they were the beneficiary of a province and fate.</v>

952
00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:15.961
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

953
00:46:15.961 --> 00:46:17.640
<v Speaker 3>there is some element of luck in life,</v>

954
00:46:17.641 --> 00:46:17.851
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

955
00:46:17.851 --> 00:46:18.640
<v Speaker 3>But with 70,</v>

956
00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:20.520
<v Speaker 3>we want everyone to be unlucky.</v>

957
00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:21.420
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

958
00:46:21.450 --> 00:46:23.340
<v Speaker 3>That seems like a bad solution.</v>

959
00:46:23.570 --> 00:46:25.670
<v Speaker 3>And so and so and,</v>

960
00:46:25.671 --> 00:46:25.831
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

961
00:46:25.831 --> 00:46:28.680
<v Speaker 3>and the other thing too is you actually want there to be people who are better</v>

962
00:46:28.681 --> 00:46:30.950
<v Speaker 3>than you would think because like what the hell else are you?</v>

963
00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:34.420
<v Speaker 3>What are you gonna do with their arm or you want some odd,</v>

964
00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:34.691
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

965
00:46:34.691 --> 00:46:36.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean we already discussed that.</v>

966
00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:37.140
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're up,</v>

967
00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:39.270
<v Speaker 3>you're up the pedicle and all seven dimensions.</v>

968
00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:39.631
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

969
00:46:39.631 --> 00:46:39.901
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

970
00:46:39.901 --> 00:46:40.760
<v Speaker 3>is your guns like,</v>

971
00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:41.703
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

972
00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:44.070
<v Speaker 3>welcome to the promise land.</v>

973
00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:47.760
<v Speaker 3>Like you need people who are better than you think.</v>

974
00:46:47.761 --> 00:46:48.830
<v Speaker 3>So then you have something to eat.</v>

975
00:46:48.850 --> 00:46:50.610
<v Speaker 3>Now the question is,</v>

976
00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:50.791
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

977
00:46:50.791 --> 00:46:51.390
<v Speaker 3>how do you,</v>

978
00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:54.360
<v Speaker 3>how do you aim and improvement without calling Craig venter this?</v>

979
00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:56.910
<v Speaker 3>And I would say use yourself as a control subject.</v>

980
00:46:57.210 --> 00:46:59.700
<v Speaker 3>It's sort of an idea I can write from,</v>

981
00:46:59.970 --> 00:47:01.830
<v Speaker 3>from being an experimental psychologist,</v>

982
00:47:01.831 --> 00:47:02.011
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

983
00:47:02.011 --> 00:47:02.610
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

984
00:47:02.610 --> 00:47:03.443
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

985
00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:06.720
<v Speaker 3>if you produce two groups and you and you run an experiment,</v>

986
00:47:06.721 --> 00:47:09.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do the experiment on one group or use the other group as a control</v>

987
00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:09.890
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

988
00:47:09.890 --> 00:47:10.860
<v Speaker 3>The comparison group.</v>

989
00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:14.310
<v Speaker 3>But you need a comparison group for your own project,</v>

990
00:47:14.730 --> 00:47:17.550
<v Speaker 3>let's say self improvement and the question is,</v>

991
00:47:17.551 --> 00:47:17.701
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

992
00:47:17.701 --> 00:47:21.530
<v Speaker 3>who the hell should you compare yourself to if you're going to improve and that</v>

993
00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:24.100
<v Speaker 3>you have,</v>

994
00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:29.110
<v Speaker 3>because that's the perfect comparison that the guy that was due yesterday,</v>

995
00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:33.430
<v Speaker 3>exactly like you has all your privileges.</v>

996
00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:38.100
<v Speaker 3>He's the same guy and so I'm so.</v>

997
00:47:38.250 --> 00:47:39.700
<v Speaker 3>Whatever's holding you back,</v>

998
00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:40.740
<v Speaker 3>what's holding you back?</v>

999
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:44.350
<v Speaker 3>It's the same thing and whatever opportunities are ahead of you were ahead of</v>

1000
00:47:44.351 --> 00:47:45.030
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

1001
00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:45.581
<v Speaker 3>So you think,</v>

1002
00:47:45.581 --> 00:47:46.414
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1003
00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:48.370
<v Speaker 3>I can be a little bit better than he was,</v>

1004
00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:53.030
<v Speaker 3>and that's a group game because it allows you to accomplish because you know</v>

1005
00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:55.240
<v Speaker 3>there's plenty of room for self improvement,</v>

1006
00:47:55.241 --> 00:47:55.421
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1007
00:47:55.421 --> 00:47:59.140
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to run out of things to manage and so you get the comparison.</v>

1008
00:47:59.350 --> 00:48:03.190
<v Speaker 3>But it's a realistic control and this is a very powerful technique.</v>

1009
00:48:03.191 --> 00:48:06.400
<v Speaker 3>I learned this partly because I'm a behavioral psychologist in particular</v>

1010
00:48:06.490 --> 00:48:09.460
<v Speaker 3>behavioral psychologists do when you go see them,</v>

1011
00:48:09.490 --> 00:48:13.630
<v Speaker 3>it's quite fun to be trained this way is they take larger problems like I need</v>

1012
00:48:13.631 --> 00:48:14.500
<v Speaker 3>to get my life together.</v>

1013
00:48:14.501 --> 00:48:17.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm unhappy and miserable what I need to get my life together.</v>

1014
00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:17.740
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1015
00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:19.270
<v Speaker 3>that's way too big a problem.</v>

1016
00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:20.560
<v Speaker 3>You're never going to solve that problem.</v>

1017
00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:21.600
<v Speaker 3>That's just.</v>

1018
00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:25.060
<v Speaker 3>It's too big and too many than everyone else has the same problem and there's no</v>

1019
00:48:25.061 --> 00:48:25.894
<v Speaker 3>cure for it.</v>

1020
00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:28.273
<v Speaker 3>So it's</v>

1021
00:48:34.110 --> 00:48:35.640
<v Speaker 3>true to the point of being a true,</v>

1022
00:48:35.641 --> 00:48:36.100
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

1023
00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:36.430
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1024
00:48:36.430 --> 00:48:36.571
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1025
00:48:36.571 --> 00:48:36.661
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1026
00:48:36.661 --> 00:48:36.960
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1027
00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:37.111
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1028
00:48:37.111 --> 00:48:37.690
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1029
00:48:37.690 --> 00:48:38.920
<v Speaker 3>We want to decompose that.</v>

1030
00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:40.080
<v Speaker 3>We want to differentiate that.</v>

1031
00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:40.930
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1032
00:48:40.930 --> 00:48:42.880
<v Speaker 3>exactly why are you registered miserable.</v>

1033
00:48:42.890 --> 00:48:43.660
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1034
00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:45.640
<v Speaker 3>let's not have a one phrase description.</v>

1035
00:48:45.641 --> 00:48:47.700
<v Speaker 3>Let's talk about your fiverr page description.</v>

1036
00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:52.890
<v Speaker 3>What the Hell is wrong with you live at the level of details that might enable</v>

1037
00:48:53.651 --> 00:48:55.600
<v Speaker 3>you to actually do something about it.</v>

1038
00:48:55.690 --> 00:48:56.290
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1039
00:48:56.290 --> 00:48:56.471
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1040
00:48:56.471 --> 00:48:58.900
<v Speaker 3>one of the things I do with my clients is if they're,</v>

1041
00:48:58.901 --> 00:49:00.430
<v Speaker 3>if they're depressed and anxious,</v>

1042
00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:02.590
<v Speaker 3>the first thing they ask them,</v>

1043
00:49:02.591 --> 00:49:02.921
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1044
00:49:02.921 --> 00:49:03.754
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

1045
00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:05.140
<v Speaker 3>tell me about your sleep schedule.</v>

1046
00:49:05.890 --> 00:49:10.000
<v Speaker 3>And a very large proportion of people depressed and anxious or otherwise,</v>

1047
00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:14.020
<v Speaker 3>unless they're locked into a fairly rigid schedule,</v>

1048
00:49:14.110 --> 00:49:16.420
<v Speaker 3>have a very dysregulated sleep and wake schedule.</v>

1049
00:49:16.421 --> 00:49:17.201
<v Speaker 3>It's very common one,</v>

1050
00:49:17.201 --> 00:49:18.640
<v Speaker 3>university students for example,</v>

1051
00:49:18.641 --> 00:49:23.641
<v Speaker 3>so they get up at like 7:00 one day and 2:00 the next day at 3:00 the next day,</v>

1052
00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:24.131
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1053
00:49:24.131 --> 00:49:25.030
<v Speaker 3>8:00 the next day,</v>

1054
00:49:25.031 --> 00:49:28.130
<v Speaker 3>although the 8:00 and 6:00 thinks they're rarer,</v>

1055
00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:30.370
<v Speaker 3>but the first thing is like,</v>

1056
00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:31.810
<v Speaker 3>why don't you fix that?</v>

1057
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:35.410
<v Speaker 3>You'll pick a god damn time and get up like,</v>

1058
00:49:35.411 --> 00:49:35.830
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>

1059
00:49:35.830 --> 00:49:37.060
<v Speaker 3>like a civilized person.</v>

1060
00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:41.013
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1061
00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:45.550
<v Speaker 3>One of the things you want to do if you want to have a child,</v>

1062
00:49:45.570 --> 00:49:50.570
<v Speaker 3>like an infant that is absolutely dreadfully miserable all the time is stabilize</v>

1063
00:49:51.711 --> 00:49:55.570
<v Speaker 3>the time they go to bed at the time they wake up and because the child is trying</v>

1064
00:49:55.571 --> 00:49:57.490
<v Speaker 3>to stabilize its nervous system,</v>

1065
00:49:58.030 --> 00:49:58.863
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1066
00:49:59.390 --> 00:50:02.610
<v Speaker 3>Because life is very chaotic and what you're trying to do with the child is</v>

1067
00:50:02.650 --> 00:50:07.650
<v Speaker 3>provide some islands of stability so that the child can organize it's competence</v>

1068
00:50:07.721 --> 00:50:10.750
<v Speaker 3>around those islands of stability and you need to do the same thing for</v>

1069
00:50:10.751 --> 00:50:11.320
<v Speaker 3>yourself.</v>

1070
00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:12.010
<v Speaker 3>It's like if,</v>

1071
00:50:12.010 --> 00:50:15.430
<v Speaker 3>if things are all over the place in your life,</v>

1072
00:50:15.490 --> 00:50:17.250
<v Speaker 3>then you can start stabilizing and say like,</v>

1073
00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:18.430
<v Speaker 3>pick a time to get up.</v>

1074
00:50:18.730 --> 00:50:19.563
<v Speaker 3>What time?</v>

1075
00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:20.530
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1076
00:50:20.890 --> 00:50:22.930
<v Speaker 3>how about a why?</v>

1077
00:50:23.010 --> 00:50:24.550
<v Speaker 3>Because that's what most people get to.</v>

1078
00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:25.970
<v Speaker 3>So here's another rule.</v>

1079
00:50:26.050 --> 00:50:27.500
<v Speaker 3>You should do what most people do,</v>

1080
00:50:27.810 --> 00:50:30.520
<v Speaker 3>unless they're special</v>

1081
00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:37.760
<v Speaker 3>person can't get up at eight because I'm a bleeding flaming genius at creating.</v>

1082
00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:44.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm inventing Toronto Equations will never say you don't have to get up at</v>

1083
00:50:44.811 --> 00:50:45.644
<v Speaker 3>eight,</v>

1084
00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:53.160
<v Speaker 3>but if you're not Michelangelo or or Einstein was doing what people do because</v>

1085
00:50:53.781 --> 00:50:57.050
<v Speaker 3>they have a reason for doing it and then you fit in the world a little bit and</v>

1086
00:50:57.051 --> 00:51:00.980
<v Speaker 3>it's also not such a bad thing to fit in the world a little bit better because</v>

1087
00:51:01.310 --> 00:51:06.310
<v Speaker 3>it's just easier for you for everyone else and so and then you might be okay,</v>

1088
00:51:07.011 --> 00:51:08.040
<v Speaker 3>so then you might take one.</v>

1089
00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:11.030
<v Speaker 3>I can't just all of a sudden get up at 8:00 in the morning.</v>

1090
00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:12.130
<v Speaker 3>I don't have the discipline.</v>

1091
00:51:12.350 --> 00:51:13.160
<v Speaker 3>It's okay.</v>

1092
00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:14.120
<v Speaker 3>No problem.</v>

1093
00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:18.500
<v Speaker 3>How about you get up before 10 for like three days?</v>

1094
00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:19.653
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

1095
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.871
<v Speaker 3>Seriously.</v>

1096
00:51:20.871 --> 00:51:24.050
<v Speaker 3>It's like an idiot if you have a real discussion with someone about this.</v>

1097
00:51:24.051 --> 00:51:24.321
<v Speaker 3>You say,</v>

1098
00:51:24.321 --> 00:51:24.561
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1099
00:51:24.561 --> 00:51:25.394
<v Speaker 3>here's the deal.</v>

1100
00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:28.850
<v Speaker 3>I know it's hard for people to change the behavior.</v>

1101
00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:29.930
<v Speaker 3>I understand that.</v>

1102
00:51:30.050 --> 00:51:32.030
<v Speaker 3>And what I want you to do,</v>

1103
00:51:32.090 --> 00:51:34.700
<v Speaker 3>we're going to figure out a plan that will make things better for you with,</v>

1104
00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:37.760
<v Speaker 3>I don't want you to agree with the plan unless you agree with it,</v>

1105
00:51:37.761 --> 00:51:39.290
<v Speaker 3>because what the hell is that?</v>

1106
00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:41.540
<v Speaker 3>We're going to come up with a plan and you know perfectly well,</v>

1107
00:51:41.541 --> 00:51:44.360
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to implement it and you're going to tell me it's a good plan</v>

1108
00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:47.930
<v Speaker 3>because you're too agreeable and you want to make me happy or some bad reasons</v>

1109
00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:48.800
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

1110
00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:50.570
<v Speaker 3>And then we're just wasting our time.</v>

1111
00:51:50.571 --> 00:51:53.750
<v Speaker 3>So why don't we just assume that it's just as hard for you to change your</v>

1112
00:51:53.751 --> 00:51:56.900
<v Speaker 3>behavior as it is in everyone else and you're probably not going to do it.</v>

1113
00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:58.240
<v Speaker 3>And so don't say yes.</v>

1114
00:51:58.260 --> 00:52:00.320
<v Speaker 3>Anything that you don't think you would actually do.</v>

1115
00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:04.680
<v Speaker 3>And then that's an exercise in humility because you know,</v>

1116
00:52:04.681 --> 00:52:07.460
<v Speaker 3>when we tried to go to the gym three times a week and you fail.</v>

1117
00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:10.460
<v Speaker 3>And so like everyone or almost everyone,</v>

1118
00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:14.710
<v Speaker 3>and no matter how many of those resolutions you make a new year's,</v>

1119
00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:15.560
<v Speaker 3>you just don't do it.</v>

1120
00:52:15.561 --> 00:52:18.480
<v Speaker 3>You don't stop eating cake and you don't stop drinking too.</v>

1121
00:52:18.610 --> 00:52:18.900
<v Speaker 3>Beer,</v>

1122
00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:19.820
<v Speaker 3>fear and all of that.</v>

1123
00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:21.320
<v Speaker 3>You just keep doing so.</v>

1124
00:52:21.321 --> 00:52:21.540
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1125
00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:23.030
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to change your behavior,</v>

1126
00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:26.540
<v Speaker 3>so I'm going to lay out a plan with you.</v>

1127
00:52:26.541 --> 00:52:27.231
<v Speaker 3>We'll discuss it,</v>

1128
00:52:27.231 --> 00:52:30.380
<v Speaker 3>and if you think that it's a good plan that you might do then say Gif,</v>

1129
00:52:30.381 --> 00:52:31.240
<v Speaker 3>but otherwise say no,</v>

1130
00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:36.200
<v Speaker 3>what will a floor but we want to do is aim low enough so that you have a</v>

1131
00:52:36.201 --> 00:52:40.940
<v Speaker 3>reasonable probability of success and in our three constitute some improvement.</v>

1132
00:52:41.530 --> 00:52:42.470
<v Speaker 3>Now Carl Jung said,</v>

1133
00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:45.200
<v Speaker 3>modern people don't see God because they don't look low enough,</v>

1134
00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:47.690
<v Speaker 3>and that's the sort of thing that he was referring to.</v>

1135
00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:48.410
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1136
00:52:48.410 --> 00:52:49.820
<v Speaker 3>let's say you want to improve yourself.</v>

1137
00:52:49.850 --> 00:52:50.211
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1138
00:52:50.211 --> 00:52:51.050
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1139
00:52:51.170 --> 00:52:52.480
<v Speaker 3>how much are you capable of,</v>

1140
00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:52.911
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1141
00:52:52.911 --> 00:52:56.120
<v Speaker 3>lead from you to the Messiah one week?</v>

1142
00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:56.983
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1143
00:52:57.020 --> 00:52:58.070
<v Speaker 3>that's not going to happen.</v>

1144
00:52:58.130 --> 00:53:01.060
<v Speaker 3>Like you might be slightly better than your wretched self,</v>

1145
00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:05.300
<v Speaker 3>one 10th of one percent or something like that,</v>

1146
00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:10.790
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't have because of the trajectory is more important than the</v>

1147
00:53:10.791 --> 00:53:15.110
<v Speaker 3>starting place and incremental improvements are staggeringly worthwhile.</v>

1148
00:53:15.350 --> 00:53:19.460
<v Speaker 3>They pumped up incredibly quickly and it's part of the reflection of this prieto</v>

1149
00:53:19.461 --> 00:53:23.390
<v Speaker 3>distribution issue or price's law is when you started improving things,</v>

1150
00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:24.740
<v Speaker 3>each time improved something.</v>

1151
00:53:24.741 --> 00:53:28.860
<v Speaker 3>You've the probability that the next improvement will work and so there will be</v>

1152
00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:29.930
<v Speaker 3>improvement.</v>

1153
00:53:30.930 --> 00:53:32.640
<v Speaker 3>Trajectory isn't linear.</v>

1154
00:53:33.150 --> 00:53:37.050
<v Speaker 3>It's like this and so if you can get the damn thing going,</v>

1155
00:53:37.410 --> 00:53:38.580
<v Speaker 3>which is hard,</v>

1156
00:53:38.730 --> 00:53:42.300
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to get those initial steps in place that can really take off if you're</v>

1157
00:53:42.301 --> 00:53:45.120
<v Speaker 3>consistent with it and so what it might mean the first week is if you're</v>

1158
00:53:45.121 --> 00:53:47.110
<v Speaker 3>sleeping schedule is completely awry.</v>

1159
00:53:47.370 --> 00:53:51.960
<v Speaker 3>Then you get up three days this week before 10:00 and that's like 10 percent</v>

1160
00:53:51.961 --> 00:53:53.310
<v Speaker 3>better than the previous week.</v>

1161
00:53:53.370 --> 00:53:53.690
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1162
00:53:53.690 --> 00:53:54.523
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

1163
00:53:55.110 --> 00:53:58.530
<v Speaker 3>you've compared yourself than you were yesterday and now you're better,</v>

1164
00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:01.080
<v Speaker 3>and then the next thing I ask people is like,</v>

1165
00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:02.580
<v Speaker 3>what do you do when you get up?</v>

1166
00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:03.730
<v Speaker 3>Do you eat now?</v>

1167
00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:07.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm not one of those people who have some breakfast to be wonderful human beings</v>

1168
00:54:07.210 --> 00:54:08.310
<v Speaker 3>that need to say,</v>

1169
00:54:08.860 --> 00:54:09.400
<v Speaker 3>why do I?</v>

1170
00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:09.900
<v Speaker 3>I've never.</v>

1171
00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:12.090
<v Speaker 3>I've never been hungry in the morning as well.</v>

1172
00:54:12.091 --> 00:54:13.080
<v Speaker 3>That wasn't a question.</v>

1173
00:54:13.550 --> 00:54:16.020
<v Speaker 3>It's like I didn't ask you if you enjoy breakfast,</v>

1174
00:54:16.170 --> 00:54:17.040
<v Speaker 3>that's not the point.</v>

1175
00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:22.400
<v Speaker 3>The point is you had to fast for 12 hours or 16 hours and now you have three</v>

1176
00:54:22.471 --> 00:54:23.221
<v Speaker 3>cups of coffee,</v>

1177
00:54:23.221 --> 00:54:26.970
<v Speaker 3>which is not a very good idea and then you load yourself cognitively and you</v>

1178
00:54:26.971 --> 00:54:28.380
<v Speaker 3>just regulate yourself.</v>

1179
00:54:28.381 --> 00:54:29.850
<v Speaker 3>Psychophysiologic Lee,</v>

1180
00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:31.200
<v Speaker 3>because you hyper produce insulin.</v>

1181
00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:32.370
<v Speaker 3>As soon as you stressed yourself,</v>

1182
00:54:32.371 --> 00:54:35.400
<v Speaker 3>you take all the sugar out of your blood and then you're basically screwed until</v>

1183
00:54:35.401 --> 00:54:36.450
<v Speaker 3>you sleep again that night.</v>

1184
00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:41.100
<v Speaker 3>And so if you're anxious more than you want to be and you don't eat breakfast,</v>

1185
00:54:41.130 --> 00:54:45.360
<v Speaker 3>you can probably get rid of 30 to 40 percent of your anxiety just by eating</v>

1186
00:54:45.361 --> 00:54:46.950
<v Speaker 3>breakfast and you think,</v>

1187
00:54:46.951 --> 00:54:47.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1188
00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:47.770
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1189
00:54:47.770 --> 00:54:48.560
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1190
00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:49.393
<v Speaker 3>you have</v>

1191
00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:51.393
<v Speaker 3>to</v>

1192
00:54:52.170 --> 00:54:52.360
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>

1193
00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:52.530
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1194
00:54:52.530 --> 00:54:52.910
<v Speaker 3>I read it.</v>

1195
00:54:52.910 --> 00:54:53.980
<v Speaker 3>I don't like breakfast.</v>

1196
00:54:54.210 --> 00:54:54.780
<v Speaker 3>Like eggs.</v>

1197
00:54:54.780 --> 00:54:57.090
<v Speaker 3>Like who cares what the hell?</v>

1198
00:54:57.230 --> 00:54:59.340
<v Speaker 3>Like what kind of experiences</v>

1199
00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:08.653
<v Speaker 3>for.</v>

1200
00:55:09.930 --> 00:55:10.763
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1201
00:55:10.850 --> 00:55:13.590
<v Speaker 3>When you probably develop the habit of not eating breakfast,</v>

1202
00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:15.570
<v Speaker 3>do you haven't revisited it since then?</v>

1203
00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:20.370
<v Speaker 3>So eat something that's sort of protein and fat heavy in the morning and at six</v>

1204
00:55:20.371 --> 00:55:21.780
<v Speaker 3>months you will start through joy it.</v>

1205
00:55:21.810 --> 00:55:25.830
<v Speaker 3>I thought that's a whole different issue and then just do that three days this</v>

1206
00:55:25.831 --> 00:55:29.580
<v Speaker 3>week and see if you feel better and if you don't,</v>

1207
00:55:29.581 --> 00:55:30.030
<v Speaker 3>well that,</v>

1208
00:55:30.030 --> 00:55:32.330
<v Speaker 3>you know I'm wrong and so much for that stupid theory,</v>

1209
00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:33.650
<v Speaker 3>we'll try but.</v>

1210
00:55:34.290 --> 00:55:35.160
<v Speaker 3>And we'll try it,</v>

1211
00:55:35.161 --> 00:55:36.240
<v Speaker 3>but people come back.</v>

1212
00:55:36.241 --> 00:55:40.290
<v Speaker 3>I had one client who was actually starving.</v>

1213
00:55:41.370 --> 00:55:42.203
<v Speaker 3>I mean she,</v>

1214
00:55:42.450 --> 00:55:43.290
<v Speaker 3>this person was,</v>

1215
00:55:43.310 --> 00:55:45.390
<v Speaker 3>was very nicely put together.</v>

1216
00:55:45.450 --> 00:55:49.320
<v Speaker 3>Twenty five year old professional woman and all she ate was like two handfuls of</v>

1217
00:55:49.321 --> 00:55:51.030
<v Speaker 3>rice a day and she said,</v>

1218
00:55:51.031 --> 00:55:53.850
<v Speaker 3>I come home and all I can do is to sort of fall over on the couch.</v>

1219
00:55:53.851 --> 00:55:55.500
<v Speaker 3>And I watched the same movie every night.</v>

1220
00:55:55.940 --> 00:55:56.251
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>

1221
00:55:56.251 --> 00:55:57.870
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why any energy.</v>

1222
00:55:58.350 --> 00:56:02.190
<v Speaker 3>So I did a careful analysis of her sleep and eating habits and I thought,</v>

1223
00:56:02.670 --> 00:56:02.761
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1224
00:56:02.761 --> 00:56:03.990
<v Speaker 3>well you're actually starving.</v>

1225
00:56:03.991 --> 00:56:04.824
<v Speaker 3>That's your</v>

1226
00:56:07.010 --> 00:56:07.350
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1227
00:56:07.350 --> 00:56:08.183
<v Speaker 3>I really liked</v>

1228
00:56:16.690 --> 00:56:17.523
<v Speaker 3>that job.</v>

1229
00:56:19.150 --> 00:56:22.350
<v Speaker 3>It's a testament to the lack of utility of envy.</v>

1230
00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:23.273
<v Speaker 3>That's the first.</v>

1231
00:56:23.650 --> 00:56:28.650
<v Speaker 3>And it's also our encouragement to be humble enough to make small improvements</v>

1232
00:56:32.351 --> 00:56:36.610
<v Speaker 3>to who you are in the hopes that that will catch on and moving forward.</v>

1233
00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:39.940
<v Speaker 3>And I can offer you a sort of a strategy for that.</v>

1234
00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:40.953
<v Speaker 3>This is a nice one.</v>

1235
00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:41.621
<v Speaker 3>This actually,</v>

1236
00:56:41.621 --> 00:56:45.700
<v Speaker 3>this actually works quite well and I do lay it over to some degree in the book.</v>

1237
00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:46.230
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1238
00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:48.520
<v Speaker 3>So the first thing is you might take stock and think,</v>

1239
00:56:48.521 --> 00:56:48.761
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1240
00:56:48.761 --> 00:56:49.900
<v Speaker 3>well what are you doing that you know,</v>

1241
00:56:49.901 --> 00:56:50.810
<v Speaker 3>that stupid.</v>

1242
00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:52.480
<v Speaker 3>It's like you can make a long list here.</v>

1243
00:56:52.481 --> 00:56:53.201
<v Speaker 3>Stupid things.</v>

1244
00:56:53.201 --> 00:56:54.011
<v Speaker 3>I know I do that.</v>

1245
00:56:54.011 --> 00:56:54.730
<v Speaker 3>I should stop.</v>

1246
00:56:54.730 --> 00:56:55.151
<v Speaker 3>It's okay,</v>

1247
00:56:55.151 --> 00:56:55.860
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>

1248
00:56:55.860 --> 00:56:56.141
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

1249
00:56:56.141 --> 00:56:56.860
<v Speaker 3>That's no problem.</v>

1250
00:56:56.860 --> 00:56:58.450
<v Speaker 3>You can ask yourself that question.</v>

1251
00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:03.010
<v Speaker 3>What stupid things do I do that make my life more wretched and few tiles that it</v>

1252
00:57:03.011 --> 00:57:04.450
<v Speaker 3>has to be okay?</v>

1253
00:57:04.451 --> 00:57:05.070
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1254
00:57:05.070 --> 00:57:05.560
<v Speaker 3>and if you,</v>

1255
00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:08.920
<v Speaker 3>if you do a little meditation around that and we actually want to know,</v>

1256
00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:12.870
<v Speaker 3>you'll come up with a list pretty fast and it's kind of a humbling exercise,</v>

1257
00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:13.120
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1258
00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:13.960
<v Speaker 3>To do that.</v>

1259
00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:14.550
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>

1260
00:57:14.550 --> 00:57:17.430
<v Speaker 3>But it's worthwhile because if your life is more regimented,</v>

1261
00:57:17.431 --> 00:57:19.120
<v Speaker 3>few titles that people want to be,</v>

1262
00:57:19.150 --> 00:57:23.470
<v Speaker 3>it's possible that the reason it's like that at least in part is because you're</v>

1263
00:57:23.471 --> 00:57:25.210
<v Speaker 3>doing things to yourself that are good for you.</v>

1264
00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:28.140
<v Speaker 3>And so then there's the question that derives his therapy,</v>

1265
00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:28.960
<v Speaker 3>which would be,</v>

1266
00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:29.560
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1267
00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:33.730
<v Speaker 3>if your life is the way you want it to be and you start doing all the stupid</v>

1268
00:57:33.731 --> 00:57:35.440
<v Speaker 3>things you know that you're doing,</v>

1269
00:57:35.620 --> 00:57:37.090
<v Speaker 3>then how much better would it be?</v>

1270
00:57:37.290 --> 00:57:39.160
<v Speaker 3>And the answer is you don't know,</v>

1271
00:57:39.310 --> 00:57:40.590
<v Speaker 3>maybe it would be way better.</v>

1272
00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:43.320
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it would be so much better than it wouldn't be wretched and futile</v>

1273
00:57:43.330 --> 00:57:44.163
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

1274
00:57:44.170 --> 00:57:47.090
<v Speaker 3>And so it might be worth that might be worth finding out,</v>

1275
00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:48.670
<v Speaker 3>hyperventilate.</v>

1276
00:57:48.750 --> 00:57:48.971
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1277
00:57:48.971 --> 00:57:51.850
<v Speaker 3>if you don't want to just suck the stupidly it would be,</v>

1278
00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:54.970
<v Speaker 3>it wouldn't be worthwhile making the effort to find out.</v>

1279
00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:56.140
<v Speaker 3>And so</v>

1280
00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:09.700
<v Speaker 3>after 20 years of teaching from my wife to actually drink water,</v>

1281
00:58:13.570 --> 00:58:14.403
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1282
00:58:14.590 --> 00:58:18.640
<v Speaker 3>so now you make a list of your faults and then you think,</v>

1283
00:58:18.641 --> 00:58:20.520
<v Speaker 3>well I got you're useful and I'm pretty bad,</v>

1284
00:58:20.521 --> 00:58:21.060
<v Speaker 3>but it's the.</v>

1285
00:58:21.060 --> 00:58:25.990
<v Speaker 3>And probably I don't do any of the things I need to do to fix any of that.</v>

1286
00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:29.830
<v Speaker 3>But maybe there's something on this list that I could fix that I actually would</v>

1287
00:58:29.831 --> 00:58:30.664
<v Speaker 3>fix.</v>

1288
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:32.920
<v Speaker 3>And so that's like asking yourself again,</v>

1289
00:58:33.150 --> 00:58:34.240
<v Speaker 3>don't tell yourself.</v>

1290
00:58:34.450 --> 00:58:39.070
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're negotiating with someone who's kind of fake headed and you know</v>

1291
00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:42.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm very well put together and you can just tell them what to do because they're</v>

1292
00:58:42.641 --> 00:58:43.570
<v Speaker 3>not going to do it,</v>

1293
00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:48.070
<v Speaker 3>but you might go an ask them if there was something that they would do,</v>

1294
00:58:48.370 --> 00:58:49.660
<v Speaker 3>what it might be,</v>

1295
00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:52.330
<v Speaker 3>and you can do that to yourself and people have got this list.</v>

1296
00:58:52.690 --> 00:58:53.860
<v Speaker 3>Is there something on this list?</v>

1297
00:58:53.890 --> 00:58:58.270
<v Speaker 3>Is there some step I could take to address something on this list?</v>

1298
00:58:58.510 --> 00:59:00.190
<v Speaker 3>Then I would actually take.</v>

1299
00:59:00.250 --> 00:59:04.450
<v Speaker 3>Then I would have answered that almost invariably.</v>

1300
00:59:04.451 --> 00:59:04.930
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1301
00:59:04.930 --> 00:59:05.171
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1302
00:59:05.171 --> 00:59:05.740
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1303
00:59:05.740 --> 00:59:06.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1304
00:59:06.100 --> 00:59:06.330
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

1305
00:59:06.330 --> 00:59:07.450
<v Speaker 3>my closet,</v>

1306
00:59:07.451 --> 00:59:09.250
<v Speaker 3>it's a squall of the alcohol.</v>

1307
00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:14.430
<v Speaker 3>I might be willing to take three of the lowest of all pieces of laundry out and</v>

1308
00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.100
<v Speaker 3>contemplate something like that.</v>

1309
00:59:19.410 --> 00:59:24.410
<v Speaker 3>Or maybe I have a stack of papers guess and this sort of strewn everywhere and I</v>

1310
00:59:25.341 --> 00:59:27.220
<v Speaker 3>don't want to do anything with them,</v>

1311
00:59:27.260 --> 00:59:30.290
<v Speaker 3>but I'll go in like a look at the top three pieces of paper.</v>

1312
00:59:31.420 --> 00:59:32.930
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot harder than you think,</v>

1313
00:59:32.931 --> 00:59:33.500
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1314
00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:34.500
<v Speaker 3>Because you know,</v>

1315
00:59:34.501 --> 00:59:36.830
<v Speaker 3>you create a stack of paper like that.</v>

1316
00:59:37.010 --> 00:59:39.110
<v Speaker 3>You walk into the room where that's Dr Pepper is.</v>

1317
00:59:39.111 --> 00:59:40.850
<v Speaker 3>You won't even look at that ball.</v>

1318
00:59:41.670 --> 00:59:45.170
<v Speaker 3>That's because it's full of snakes and that's how your body's responding to</v>

1319
00:59:45.850 --> 00:59:46.683
<v Speaker 3>snakes,</v>

1320
00:59:46.810 --> 00:59:47.643
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1321
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:54.050
<v Speaker 3>Technically that is exactly what because it isn't the predatory detect is the</v>

1322
00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:55.830
<v Speaker 3>Predator detection circuit that kicks in,</v>

1323
00:59:55.831 --> 00:59:59.300
<v Speaker 3>that makes you don't look at those faces and for good reason and so if you go</v>

1324
00:59:59.301 --> 01:00:00.134
<v Speaker 3>there and you just,</v>

1325
01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:04.700
<v Speaker 3>you're like 60 percent of the way to actually doing something about them and so</v>

1326
01:00:04.701 --> 01:00:06.560
<v Speaker 3>you've got to negotiate with yourself and think,</v>

1327
01:00:06.561 --> 01:00:06.861
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1328
01:00:06.861 --> 01:00:11.780
<v Speaker 3>well if I've got to fix myself off what in my current wretched state,</v>

1329
01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:15.800
<v Speaker 3>what small steps am I actually willing to take and that works.</v>

1330
01:00:15.830 --> 01:00:16.690
<v Speaker 3>It really works.</v>

1331
01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:18.470
<v Speaker 3>And that's where behavioral psychologist,</v>

1332
01:00:18.471 --> 01:00:18.690
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1333
01:00:18.690 --> 01:00:23.690
<v Speaker 3>it's like break the dam them down until you're willing to take a step forward on</v>

1334
01:00:25.131 --> 01:00:25.870
<v Speaker 3>that pathway.</v>

1335
01:00:25.870 --> 01:00:28.820
<v Speaker 3>If something is completely intractable that's facing you,</v>

1336
01:00:28.930 --> 01:00:29.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1337
01:00:29.670 --> 01:00:33.620
<v Speaker 3>decomposes and he'll just keep cutting it into smaller and smaller pieces until</v>

1338
01:00:33.621 --> 01:00:34.460
<v Speaker 3>you finally get a piece.</v>

1339
01:00:34.461 --> 01:00:34.731
<v Speaker 3>You think,</v>

1340
01:00:34.731 --> 01:00:34.881
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1341
01:00:34.881 --> 01:00:36.050
<v Speaker 3>I can ask you that,</v>

1342
01:00:36.350 --> 01:00:37.760
<v Speaker 3>but that's also still worthwhile.</v>

1343
01:00:37.770 --> 01:00:39.440
<v Speaker 3>You can't be so trivial,</v>

1344
01:00:39.441 --> 01:00:41.210
<v Speaker 3>but you don't get any satisfaction out of it,</v>

1345
01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:42.583
<v Speaker 3>so okay.</v>

1346
01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:44.433
<v Speaker 3>That's</v>

1347
01:00:50.450 --> 01:00:55.450
<v Speaker 3>basically it says despite your mention present condition and your relative lack</v>

1348
01:00:56.271 --> 01:00:57.050
<v Speaker 3>of process,</v>

1349
01:00:57.050 --> 01:01:01.340
<v Speaker 3>most things you can make it like simple enough if you think about it,</v>

1350
01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:05.060
<v Speaker 3>so that will probably be able to make it slightly better and then you can</v>

1351
01:01:05.061 --> 01:01:05.894
<v Speaker 3>iterate them.</v>

1352
01:01:05.930 --> 01:01:07.070
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's believable.</v>

1353
01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:11.210
<v Speaker 3>It's not like you're jumping up and down in some sort of narcissistic way about</v>

1354
01:01:11.211 --> 01:01:12.320
<v Speaker 3>how great you are.</v>

1355
01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:13.310
<v Speaker 3>It's not that at all.</v>

1356
01:01:13.311 --> 01:01:16.760
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're taking your limitations and the human limitations,</v>

1357
01:01:16.761 --> 01:01:16.941
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1358
01:01:16.941 --> 01:01:21.650
<v Speaker 3>Because everyone's like that into account and you're actually starting to be</v>

1359
01:01:21.651 --> 01:01:25.480
<v Speaker 3>willing to realistically work with them and it really does work and accelerate,</v>

1360
01:01:25.550 --> 01:01:26.510
<v Speaker 3>so that's a good thing.</v>

1361
01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:27.171
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1362
01:01:27.171 --> 01:01:28.180
<v Speaker 3>so rural fire,</v>

1363
01:01:28.250 --> 01:01:30.380
<v Speaker 3>this is what I thought would be very contentious,</v>

1364
01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:34.280
<v Speaker 3>but it hasn't been that contentious,</v>

1365
01:01:34.281 --> 01:01:35.630
<v Speaker 3>which actually surprises me.</v>

1366
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:39.320
<v Speaker 3>Don't let your children do anything that makes you just like,</v>

1367
01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:41.453
<v Speaker 3>now</v>

1368
01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:45.680
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to punch of fishes,</v>

1369
01:01:45.681 --> 01:01:46.514
<v Speaker 3>twists in it,</v>

1370
01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:47.031
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1371
01:01:47.031 --> 01:01:52.031
<v Speaker 3>and one of them is just propositions nested inside of one of the children can be</v>

1372
01:01:52.491 --> 01:01:53.580
<v Speaker 3>dislikable.</v>

1373
01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:54.290
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1374
01:01:54.290 --> 01:01:56.210
<v Speaker 3>What will everyone knows that,</v>

1375
01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:57.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean when you were a child,</v>

1376
01:01:57.860 --> 01:01:58.820
<v Speaker 3>there were lots of children.</v>

1377
01:01:58.821 --> 01:01:59.654
<v Speaker 3>You get light,</v>

1378
01:01:59.690 --> 01:02:00.523
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1379
01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:01.620
<v Speaker 3>When you're an adult,</v>

1380
01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:05.300
<v Speaker 3>you have friends and they have children with and you don't like.</v>

1381
01:02:05.301 --> 01:02:10.040
<v Speaker 3>Some of those children is have to do less likely to invite those adults to your</v>

1382
01:02:10.041 --> 01:02:10.371
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>

1383
01:02:10.371 --> 01:02:13.700
<v Speaker 3>You won't say anything to smile with your mouth,</v>

1384
01:02:13.701 --> 01:02:14.534
<v Speaker 3>but not your eyes.</v>

1385
01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:15.473
<v Speaker 3>When the children,</v>

1386
01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:19.020
<v Speaker 3>that's the same style of site uses</v>

1387
01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:25.050
<v Speaker 3>what it's like to be a child and no one likes.</v>

1388
01:02:25.051 --> 01:02:27.480
<v Speaker 3>And then when they go and they see adults,</v>

1389
01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:29.130
<v Speaker 3>the adults smile at them with their mouth.</v>

1390
01:02:29.131 --> 01:02:29.964
<v Speaker 3>But Dr Rice.</v>

1391
01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:32.430
<v Speaker 3>It's like what sort of world is that for a child?</v>

1392
01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:35.940
<v Speaker 3>It's like they're surrounded by well meaning cycle house,</v>

1393
01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:37.590
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1394
01:02:37.590 --> 01:02:42.120
<v Speaker 3>And that's what you do to your child if you allow them to do things that make</v>

1395
01:02:42.121 --> 01:02:43.010
<v Speaker 3>people dislike them.</v>

1396
01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:45.720
<v Speaker 3>And so that is not a good thing to do to your child.</v>

1397
01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:47.060
<v Speaker 3>And so we've been,</v>

1398
01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:47.581
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

1399
01:02:47.581 --> 01:02:49.160
<v Speaker 3>the children can be just like a whole.</v>

1400
01:02:49.230 --> 01:02:53.640
<v Speaker 3>And then we had met that parents can facilitate the dislike ability of their</v>

1401
01:02:53.641 --> 01:02:57.300
<v Speaker 3>children and we admit third that parents can dislike their children,</v>

1402
01:02:57.510 --> 01:02:59.430
<v Speaker 3>whose parents don't dislike her children.</v>

1403
01:02:59.431 --> 01:02:59.990
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1404
01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:00.090
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1405
01:03:00.090 --> 01:03:00.923
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

1406
01:03:00.930 --> 01:03:05.930
<v Speaker 3>there's at least 20 percent of the people in this audience at least have not had</v>

1407
01:03:06.821 --> 01:03:08.610
<v Speaker 3>a very good relationship with their parents.</v>

1408
01:03:09.090 --> 01:03:09.900
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1409
01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:10.350
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1410
01:03:10.350 --> 01:03:12.060
<v Speaker 3>families can be an absolute snake pit.</v>

1411
01:03:12.061 --> 01:03:15.810
<v Speaker 3>You're way more likely to be killed by a family member that a stranger like way,</v>

1412
01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:16.441
<v Speaker 3>way more,</v>

1413
01:03:16.441 --> 01:03:18.030
<v Speaker 3>like way more like,</v>

1414
01:03:18.090 --> 01:03:19.590
<v Speaker 3>especially if you drained with them.</v>

1415
01:03:19.830 --> 01:03:21.130
<v Speaker 3>So if you don't want</v>

1416
01:03:23.150 --> 01:03:25.440
<v Speaker 3>to be killed and don't treat them with your family,</v>

1417
01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:28.380
<v Speaker 3>your risk of homicide,</v>

1418
01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:32.070
<v Speaker 3>just stay away from your kid falls.</v>

1419
01:03:34.890 --> 01:03:35.191
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

1420
01:03:35.191 --> 01:03:37.290
<v Speaker 3>So now the next</v>

1421
01:03:38.910 --> 01:03:39.570
<v Speaker 3>tip,</v>

1422
01:03:39.570 --> 01:03:44.570
<v Speaker 3>contentious proposition is that perhaps you shouldn't dislike your children.</v>

1423
01:03:45.490 --> 01:03:45.841
<v Speaker 3>You Think,</v>

1424
01:03:45.841 --> 01:03:46.141
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>

1425
01:03:46.141 --> 01:03:50.080
<v Speaker 3>that can't be possibly cute kids campus like the cat.</v>

1426
01:03:50.190 --> 01:03:50.940
<v Speaker 3>You should.</v>

1427
01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:51.990
<v Speaker 3>Here's why.</v>

1428
01:03:52.050 --> 01:03:53.550
<v Speaker 3>When you just like your children,</v>

1429
01:03:54.150 --> 01:03:57.150
<v Speaker 3>you should just like your children when they're doing things that other people</v>

1430
01:03:57.151 --> 01:03:59.040
<v Speaker 3>would dislike them for doing.</v>

1431
01:03:59.430 --> 01:04:02.340
<v Speaker 3>Because if you like the video,</v>

1432
01:04:07.470 --> 01:04:09.600
<v Speaker 3>then they won't learn not to do them.</v>

1433
01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:11.480
<v Speaker 3>And then wherever they go,</v>

1434
01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:16.140
<v Speaker 3>other kids won't like them and play with them and we'll facilitate their</v>

1435
01:04:16.141 --> 01:04:21.141
<v Speaker 3>development forward because by the time your child about you have an over most</v>

1436
01:04:21.571 --> 01:04:26.571
<v Speaker 3>of the responsibility for socialization to other children.</v>

1437
01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:30.840
<v Speaker 3>So your job as a parent is to make your child likable by other children by the</v>

1438
01:04:30.841 --> 01:04:31.780
<v Speaker 3>time they're in fourth.</v>

1439
01:04:31.830 --> 01:04:33.000
<v Speaker 3>And I can tell you this too,</v>

1440
01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:34.770
<v Speaker 3>if you fail at that,</v>

1441
01:04:34.830 --> 01:04:38.400
<v Speaker 3>they will never recover no matter what you do.</v>

1442
01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:43.620
<v Speaker 3>And then the experiment with clinical literature on this is painfully clear.</v>

1443
01:04:43.710 --> 01:04:48.660
<v Speaker 3>So kids who are alienated an antisocial by the time therefore there is no one</v>

1444
01:04:48.661 --> 01:04:49.870
<v Speaker 3>knows what to do about it.</v>

1445
01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:53.010
<v Speaker 3>None of the interventions that have been tried work,</v>

1446
01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:53.691
<v Speaker 3>none of them.</v>

1447
01:04:53.691 --> 01:04:54.660
<v Speaker 3>And believe me,</v>

1448
01:04:54.690 --> 01:04:55.520
<v Speaker 3>psychologist,</v>

1449
01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:59.000
<v Speaker 3>social scientist have been hitting this problem apart since about 19,</v>

1450
01:04:59.020 --> 01:04:59.853
<v Speaker 3>25.</v>

1451
01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:02.490
<v Speaker 3>And they've done everything you can possibly think of.</v>

1452
01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:07.020
<v Speaker 3>Andy in combination and a bunch of things you can think of and it hasn't worked.</v>

1453
01:05:07.230 --> 01:05:10.950
<v Speaker 3>And so there's a critical period of development between about the age of two and</v>

1454
01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:15.980
<v Speaker 3>about gauge for where you facilitate the social acceptability of your children.</v>

1455
01:05:16.170 --> 01:05:17.590
<v Speaker 3>And if you miss that window,</v>

1456
01:05:17.610 --> 01:05:19.040
<v Speaker 3>well then good luck to them.</v>

1457
01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:21.130
<v Speaker 3>So in what seems to happen,</v>

1458
01:05:21.180 --> 01:05:22.130
<v Speaker 3>here's why it happens.</v>

1459
01:05:23.170 --> 01:05:27.590
<v Speaker 3>So let's say you have two four year olds and their size each other up and there</v>

1460
01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:30.020
<v Speaker 3>because they're trying to figure out what is elemental level,</v>

1461
01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:33.970
<v Speaker 3>the wrap and you knew you do that with adults as you want to be with an adult</v>

1462
01:05:33.971 --> 01:05:37.670
<v Speaker 3>who's kind of at the same level you are to some degree if their way to hell in</v>

1463
01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:41.150
<v Speaker 3>Bob you with some sphere and you're not going to relate to them in that sphere</v>

1464
01:05:41.151 --> 01:05:42.820
<v Speaker 3>and if the way below you will the same thing.</v>

1465
01:05:42.820 --> 01:05:46.600
<v Speaker 3>You want someone that you can kind of contend with and so kids size each other</v>

1466
01:05:46.601 --> 01:05:47.380
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

1467
01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:50.440
<v Speaker 3>If you're a four year old is still acting like a two year old.</v>

1468
01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:54.010
<v Speaker 3>Then the other four year olds will not play with him or her.</v>

1469
01:05:54.011 --> 01:05:58.450
<v Speaker 3>And then they will mature into five year olds and then they weren't mature.</v>

1470
01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:00.120
<v Speaker 3>Six year olds and then they weren't mature.</v>

1471
01:06:00.121 --> 01:06:00.910
<v Speaker 3>It's a seven year olds.</v>

1472
01:06:00.910 --> 01:06:05.910
<v Speaker 3>They'll just stay two and two that they call them the terrible twos for region</v>

1473
01:06:06.641 --> 01:06:11.641
<v Speaker 3>two year olds are relatively egocentric and so if the two year old you have a</v>

1474
01:06:12.281 --> 01:06:14.020
<v Speaker 3>child who's still to add for that,</v>

1475
01:06:14.021 --> 01:06:17.340
<v Speaker 3>that's that because the other kids won't scaffold their development,</v>

1476
01:06:17.590 --> 01:06:20.950
<v Speaker 3>so it's your job to dislike your children when they're doing things,</v>

1477
01:06:20.970 --> 01:06:22.090
<v Speaker 3>dislikable things.</v>

1478
01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:26.770
<v Speaker 3>It's your moral obligation and to correct them so that the reason you do that is</v>

1479
01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:29.210
<v Speaker 3>to correct them.</v>

1480
01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:31.360
<v Speaker 3>It's not to answer besides your authority.</v>

1481
01:06:31.550 --> 01:06:36.200
<v Speaker 3>It's not even to instill a sense of morality and the Indians some arbitrary and</v>

1482
01:06:36.220 --> 01:06:37.420
<v Speaker 3>technical way.</v>

1483
01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:39.910
<v Speaker 3>It's simple why you do that.</v>

1484
01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:41.780
<v Speaker 3>Here's what you want for your children.</v>

1485
01:06:42.190 --> 01:06:46.450
<v Speaker 3>You want them to have other children line up to play with them.</v>

1486
01:06:47.230 --> 01:06:50.500
<v Speaker 3>That's like success map and so that child is like,</v>

1487
01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:55.090
<v Speaker 3>they got the kind of social graces that allow them to go into an arena of</v>

1488
01:06:55.091 --> 01:06:57.370
<v Speaker 3>children they don't know and make friends quickly.</v>

1489
01:06:57.730 --> 01:06:58.690
<v Speaker 3>It's like victory,</v>

1490
01:06:58.750 --> 01:06:59.320
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1491
01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:03.490
<v Speaker 3>You've done 90 percent of what you have to do with imperative to manage that and</v>

1492
01:07:03.491 --> 01:07:04.330
<v Speaker 3>so and then,</v>

1493
01:07:04.331 --> 01:07:06.100
<v Speaker 3>but there's more to it to like.</v>

1494
01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:08.480
<v Speaker 3>One of the things I've moved and I have no kids,</v>

1495
01:07:08.650 --> 01:07:10.210
<v Speaker 3>I lived in a rough area in Montreal.</v>

1496
01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:14.470
<v Speaker 3>We have my daughter Mikayla booster board around this little cheap stroller in</v>

1497
01:07:14.471 --> 01:07:16.180
<v Speaker 3>this working class neighborhood in Montreal.</v>

1498
01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:17.170
<v Speaker 3>There's lots of rough guys,</v>

1499
01:07:17.590 --> 01:07:18.880
<v Speaker 3>rough people in that neighborhood,</v>

1500
01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:24.060
<v Speaker 3>but it was such fun to wheel around because you'd see these like rough looking</v>

1501
01:07:24.251 --> 01:07:24.671
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>

1502
01:07:24.671 --> 01:07:25.990
<v Speaker 3>lumberjack looking guys,</v>

1503
01:07:25.991 --> 01:07:26.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1504
01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:27.760
<v Speaker 3>a working class,</v>

1505
01:07:27.761 --> 01:07:28.860
<v Speaker 3>French Canadian type,</v>

1506
01:07:29.150 --> 01:07:31.980
<v Speaker 3>kind of tough to think like Tom Waits,</v>

1507
01:07:32.090 --> 01:07:37.090
<v Speaker 3>gestures walking down the street and they'd see our girl and they're stronger</v>

1508
01:07:37.131 --> 01:07:37.900
<v Speaker 3>and like they,</v>

1509
01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:40.870
<v Speaker 3>they instantly get a goofy grin like technicolor,</v>

1510
01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:41.171
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1511
01:07:41.171 --> 01:07:46.171
<v Speaker 3>and it's so cool because what you see is that you have to be a pretty damned</v>

1512
01:07:46.401 --> 01:07:47.870
<v Speaker 3>good in human being.</v>

1513
01:07:47.950 --> 01:07:52.750
<v Speaker 3>Not to draw up your shell and open up a little bit when you see a young child</v>

1514
01:07:52.751 --> 01:07:54.850
<v Speaker 3>who's kind of open to the world and fresh.</v>

1515
01:07:54.851 --> 01:07:55.530
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1516
01:07:55.530 --> 01:07:59.620
<v Speaker 3>And so you see the best people when you have kids and if you're fortunate,</v>

1517
01:07:59.830 --> 01:08:02.500
<v Speaker 3>and so see that's when you want for your kids,</v>

1518
01:08:02.530 --> 01:08:02.861
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1519
01:08:02.861 --> 01:08:07.810
<v Speaker 3>Is You want them to behave in a way that brings out the best in adults and so</v>

1520
01:08:07.811 --> 01:08:09.880
<v Speaker 3>when you take them out in the actual world,</v>

1521
01:08:09.910 --> 01:08:13.840
<v Speaker 3>the adults are happy and they will be given a chance,</v>

1522
01:08:13.870 --> 01:08:14.171
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1523
01:08:14.171 --> 01:08:17.000
<v Speaker 3>because people generally quite positively to children,</v>

1524
01:08:17.001 --> 01:08:20.330
<v Speaker 3>unless the children are angels or do something equally,</v>

1525
01:08:20.331 --> 01:08:21.170
<v Speaker 3>reprehensible,</v>

1526
01:08:22.330 --> 01:08:25.480
<v Speaker 3>rolling door and only gets kicked because only knows this crowd.</v>

1527
01:08:25.690 --> 01:08:29.960
<v Speaker 3>You know that's not a good strategy and so you want your kids to be eminently</v>

1528
01:08:29.961 --> 01:08:31.610
<v Speaker 3>desirements with other children,</v>

1529
01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:37.320
<v Speaker 3>not solving massive problems right there and then you want them to be attracted</v>

1530
01:08:37.581 --> 01:08:38.090
<v Speaker 3>to adults.</v>

1531
01:08:38.090 --> 01:08:43.090
<v Speaker 3>So the bands of the sign with the adults come forward and welcomes to</v>

1532
01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:48.020
<v Speaker 3>continually into the world and you can actually rely on window you despite your</v>

1533
01:08:48.021 --> 01:08:49.600
<v Speaker 3>child because look,</v>

1534
01:08:50.330 --> 01:08:52.820
<v Speaker 3>we know that you have arbitrary faults and sometimes you're good.</v>

1535
01:08:52.821 --> 01:08:55.310
<v Speaker 3>You're good to irritate you because you're ignoring everything.</v>

1536
01:08:55.311 --> 01:08:56.930
<v Speaker 3>You should be right in.</v>

1537
01:08:56.931 --> 01:08:59.340
<v Speaker 3>They're getting on your nerves and it's your plenty trauma problems,</v>

1538
01:09:00.170 --> 01:09:03.890
<v Speaker 3>but what was shooting that you're 60 to 70 percent put together or something</v>

1539
01:09:03.891 --> 01:09:04.640
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

1540
01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:05.473
<v Speaker 3>Or maybe it's higher,</v>

1541
01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:06.533
<v Speaker 3>a little lower,</v>

1542
01:09:06.750 --> 01:09:09.860
<v Speaker 3>and maybe we can also assume that you're fortunate enough to have a partner</v>

1543
01:09:09.861 --> 01:09:14.600
<v Speaker 3>who's also a 60 to 70 percent put together in a slightly different way than you,</v>

1544
01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:19.660
<v Speaker 3>and so the two of you together might make a person the in the main is 90 percent</v>

1545
01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:27.500
<v Speaker 3>and not person that you made jointly is a reflection of the social world.</v>

1546
01:09:27.530 --> 01:09:29.570
<v Speaker 3>That's what it should be because that's what a parent is.</v>

1547
01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:32.360
<v Speaker 3>A parent is a reflection of the real social,</v>

1548
01:09:33.290 --> 01:09:35.090
<v Speaker 3>and so if you're going to do your children to favor,</v>

1549
01:09:35.091 --> 01:09:40.091
<v Speaker 3>then that joint when you and your partner is reflects the reality of the social</v>

1550
01:09:40.551 --> 01:09:41.510
<v Speaker 3>world to the child.</v>

1551
01:09:41.810 --> 01:09:44.420
<v Speaker 3>So the child figures out how to live in this social world.</v>

1552
01:09:44.450 --> 01:09:45.660
<v Speaker 3>You're not their friend.</v>

1553
01:09:45.740 --> 01:09:46.960
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1554
01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:49.510
<v Speaker 3>Maybe when you're a doctor,</v>

1555
01:09:49.570 --> 01:09:53.100
<v Speaker 3>you can be friends hopefully you can be friends with and it's not quite your</v>

1556
01:09:53.130 --> 01:09:55.240
<v Speaker 3>last friend and see him way more than a friend,</v>

1557
01:09:55.540 --> 01:09:55.840
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1558
01:09:55.840 --> 01:10:00.840
<v Speaker 3>Way More and the child needs deep reflection of the social work.</v>

1559
01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:02.470
<v Speaker 3>Tampered with a bit of immersive,</v>

1560
01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:02.910
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1561
01:10:02.910 --> 01:10:04.400
<v Speaker 3>Because if you're a parent,</v>

1562
01:10:04.401 --> 01:10:06.680
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be more forgiving of your child,</v>

1563
01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:12.100
<v Speaker 3>then the arbitrary social world wellbeing and that doesn't mean you forgive them</v>

1564
01:10:12.141 --> 01:10:12.561
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

1565
01:10:12.561 --> 01:10:13.700
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean that at all.</v>

1566
01:10:13.701 --> 01:10:15.780
<v Speaker 3>It just means that the patients you're,</v>

1567
01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:16.200
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1568
01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:17.060
<v Speaker 3>you're bringing them along.</v>

1569
01:10:17.930 --> 01:10:19.010
<v Speaker 3>That's your cool.</v>

1570
01:10:20.050 --> 01:10:20.883
<v Speaker 3>That's fine.</v>

1571
01:10:24.730 --> 01:10:25.563
<v Speaker 2>Don't</v>

1572
01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:29.350
<v Speaker 2>were able to map.</v>

1573
01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:33.060
<v Speaker 3>So you know things that you think,</v>

1574
01:10:33.330 --> 01:10:36.270
<v Speaker 3>oh very happy about that you think,</v>

1575
01:10:36.271 --> 01:10:36.511
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1576
01:10:36.511 --> 01:10:37.620
<v Speaker 3>well maybe I can fix that.</v>

1577
01:10:37.621 --> 01:10:40.050
<v Speaker 3>I can help this child figure out how to do those things.</v>

1578
01:10:40.051 --> 01:10:40.884
<v Speaker 3>You can have them.</v>

1579
01:10:40.970 --> 01:10:42.710
<v Speaker 3>So my son was an ordinary little</v>

1580
01:10:45.820 --> 01:10:46.653
<v Speaker 3>pushing it.</v>

1581
01:10:46.890 --> 01:10:47.221
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1582
01:10:47.221 --> 01:10:48.054
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1583
01:10:48.130 --> 01:10:50.790
<v Speaker 3>this definitely view in which you didn't like at all.</v>

1584
01:10:50.791 --> 01:10:53.000
<v Speaker 3>He was quite fraternity</v>

1585
01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:55.773
<v Speaker 3>necessity.</v>

1586
01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:00.840
<v Speaker 3>Kind of have a little chat with him was when he was about three and then say,</v>

1587
01:11:00.841 --> 01:11:01.081
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1588
01:11:01.081 --> 01:11:01.261
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1589
01:11:01.261 --> 01:11:05.460
<v Speaker 3>you can't act like that and you can sit here and think about it and when you're</v>

1590
01:11:05.461 --> 01:11:06.900
<v Speaker 3>ready to be a civilized human being,</v>

1591
01:11:06.901 --> 01:11:09.810
<v Speaker 3>you can come and tell me and then we'll have a good day.</v>

1592
01:11:09.811 --> 01:11:14.020
<v Speaker 3>And so you can sit here and fix things up and have a good or you can keep doing</v>

1593
01:11:14.030 --> 01:11:14.450
<v Speaker 3>what you're doing.</v>

1594
01:11:14.450 --> 01:11:17.700
<v Speaker 3>Have a wrench in the day to make choice kid,</v>

1595
01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:22.800
<v Speaker 3>so we sit on the stairs or your bath mat and I drove up to them,</v>

1596
01:11:22.801 --> 01:11:23.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1597
01:11:23.250 --> 01:11:24.780
<v Speaker 3>two minutes later and say,</v>

1598
01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:25.110
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1599
01:11:25.110 --> 01:11:26.720
<v Speaker 3>are you to get off both the stairs?</v>

1600
01:11:27.460 --> 01:11:28.293
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

1601
01:11:28.630 --> 01:11:33.630
<v Speaker 3>they was drying bonus might to control his rage and these little kid and the</v>

1602
01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:35.580
<v Speaker 3>kids fail temper Tantrum,</v>

1603
01:11:35.650 --> 01:11:37.380
<v Speaker 3>so completely consumed by rage.</v>

1604
01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:39.870
<v Speaker 3>It's not easy to bring that under control.</v>

1605
01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:43.920
<v Speaker 3>And so he was sitting there like fighting with his head with his hypothalamus,</v>

1606
01:11:43.921 --> 01:11:44.754
<v Speaker 3>this ancient,</v>

1607
01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:47.610
<v Speaker 3>trying to bring it under control and then,</v>

1608
01:11:47.611 --> 01:11:48.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1609
01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:49.140
<v Speaker 3>I'd leave him be.</v>

1610
01:11:49.230 --> 01:11:51.700
<v Speaker 3>And usually after about five minutes or so he'd come in.</v>

1611
01:11:51.701 --> 01:11:52.700
<v Speaker 3>He was more contrite.</v>

1612
01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:53.331
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1613
01:11:53.331 --> 01:11:53.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1614
01:11:53.670 --> 01:11:56.700
<v Speaker 3>the attitude that we would bring to bear then was something I'd like to right</v>

1615
01:11:56.701 --> 01:11:57.030
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>

1616
01:11:57.030 --> 01:12:01.290
<v Speaker 3>It's like he was ready to be a civilized human being again and now I instantly</v>

1617
01:12:01.291 --> 01:12:03.150
<v Speaker 3>liked him because the rule was</v>

1618
01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:07.750
<v Speaker 3>once you get off the spirits and you've decided to be a civilized,</v>

1619
01:12:07.751 --> 01:12:10.410
<v Speaker 3>he with me then I liked him right away.</v>

1620
01:12:10.420 --> 01:12:11.940
<v Speaker 3>It's like I'm not going to hold a brush.</v>

1621
01:12:12.990 --> 01:12:17.150
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the useful things about using effective disciplinary strategies so</v>

1622
01:12:17.151 --> 01:12:18.120
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to hold a grudge.</v>

1623
01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:22.260
<v Speaker 3>It's like stuck with because it's actually done with so he'd come and say,</v>

1624
01:12:22.261 --> 01:12:22.441
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1625
01:12:22.441 --> 01:12:27.010
<v Speaker 3>I want to have a good day and then we'd have a good day and so we'll kind of</v>

1626
01:12:27.060 --> 01:12:32.060
<v Speaker 3>consequences of that was that we mostly have a date and so what a deal is a</v>

1627
01:12:34.141 --> 01:12:35.730
<v Speaker 3>relationship that you have.</v>

1628
01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:39.240
<v Speaker 3>It's probably the only relationship you've ever had in your whole life where it</v>

1629
01:12:39.241 --> 01:12:43.840
<v Speaker 3>can actually be almost all good if you're careful and then only parts of the</v>

1630
01:12:43.841 --> 01:12:44.250
<v Speaker 3>concert.</v>

1631
01:12:44.250 --> 01:12:48.270
<v Speaker 3>The only consequence of that is that it generalizes for other people,</v>

1632
01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:51.810
<v Speaker 3>so not only doesn't work for you and hopefully for your partner,</v>

1633
01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:54.150
<v Speaker 3>but I don't feel works for your child and other people.</v>

1634
01:12:54.151 --> 01:12:54.661
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>

1635
01:12:54.661 --> 01:12:55.260
<v Speaker 3>what the hell?</v>

1636
01:12:55.260 --> 01:12:55.980
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>

1637
01:12:55.980 --> 01:13:00.980
<v Speaker 3>That's a pretty good deal and all you have to do is have the fortitude to let</v>

1638
01:13:01.231 --> 01:13:05.190
<v Speaker 3>your child know in the gentlest way possible but effective manner.</v>

1639
01:13:05.250 --> 01:13:05.491
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1640
01:13:05.491 --> 01:13:08.520
<v Speaker 3>Because you've never used more discipline than necessary.</v>

1641
01:13:08.521 --> 01:13:12.270
<v Speaker 3>It's just counterproductive how to conduct themselves in the world so that</v>

1642
01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:16.430
<v Speaker 3>everyone is happy with their rep and there's zero down,</v>

1643
01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:17.790
<v Speaker 3>zero downside to that,</v>

1644
01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:23.130
<v Speaker 3>except that you have to go off the responsibility of actually taking a stance in</v>

1645
01:13:23.131 --> 01:13:26.690
<v Speaker 3>relationship to your child's behavior and people are terrified of their</v>

1646
01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:27.533
<v Speaker 3>children.</v>

1647
01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:28.710
<v Speaker 3>Now especially,</v>

1648
01:13:28.890 --> 01:13:33.890
<v Speaker 3>and often we'll do that all they're willing to risk the hammer that they might</v>

1649
01:13:34.141 --> 01:13:35.510
<v Speaker 3>make in the discipline and there's.</v>

1650
01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:36.570
<v Speaker 3>It's not helpful.</v>

1651
01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:38.160
<v Speaker 3>So okay.</v>

1652
01:13:38.790 --> 01:13:39.623
<v Speaker 3>Real</v>

1653
01:13:47.730 --> 01:13:48.563
<v Speaker 3>Center,</v>

1654
01:13:48.650 --> 01:13:51.240
<v Speaker 3>Sarah House in perfect order before you criticize the world.</v>

1655
01:13:51.250 --> 01:13:54.250
<v Speaker 3>That's how that's the darkest chapter in the book.</v>

1656
01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:04.160
<v Speaker 3>I actually find it engaging to tackle dark subjects because</v>

1657
01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:10.830
<v Speaker 3>I've found that there's something believable about darkness.</v>

1658
01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:11.470
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1659
01:14:11.470 --> 01:14:14.290
<v Speaker 3>like if someone is telling you a bunch of good things,</v>

1660
01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:14.801
<v Speaker 3>you think,</v>

1661
01:14:14.801 --> 01:14:14.951
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1662
01:14:14.951 --> 01:14:16.400
<v Speaker 3>what the hell do they know?</v>

1663
01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:19.480
<v Speaker 3>It's reasonable to ask that question,</v>

1664
01:14:19.481 --> 01:14:22.090
<v Speaker 3>but if they tell you about the really dark things,</v>

1665
01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:26.020
<v Speaker 3>then while you already know those dark things exist,</v>

1666
01:14:26.021 --> 01:14:30.070
<v Speaker 3>so it's believable and then if they're willing to sort of confront,</v>

1667
01:14:30.071 --> 01:14:31.170
<v Speaker 3>those are things you think,</v>

1668
01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:32.710
<v Speaker 3>well maybe there's something to this,</v>

1669
01:14:32.950 --> 01:14:35.130
<v Speaker 3>and so what are the other chapter six was,</v>

1670
01:14:35.470 --> 01:14:38.860
<v Speaker 3>I've tried for many decades to put myself in the shoes of people who have done</v>

1671
01:14:38.861 --> 01:14:40.540
<v Speaker 3>terrible things partner.</v>

1672
01:14:40.900 --> 01:14:42.310
<v Speaker 3>I've done that when I've read history,</v>

1673
01:14:42.311 --> 01:14:43.990
<v Speaker 3>which is pretty brutal thing to do,</v>

1674
01:14:44.050 --> 01:14:47.380
<v Speaker 3>but also when I read about criminal behavior,</v>

1675
01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:49.360
<v Speaker 3>especially the brutal criminal behavior,</v>

1676
01:14:49.361 --> 01:14:50.270
<v Speaker 3>it's not even criminals.</v>

1677
01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:51.370
<v Speaker 3>The wrong way of thinking about.</v>

1678
01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:53.230
<v Speaker 3>Because you know if a criminal robs a bank,</v>

1679
01:14:53.231 --> 01:14:53.491
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1680
01:14:53.491 --> 01:14:54.700
<v Speaker 3>well they want the money.</v>

1681
01:14:55.140 --> 01:14:55.960
<v Speaker 3>That's sort of human.</v>

1682
01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:57.250
<v Speaker 3>You can relate to that,</v>

1683
01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:01.570
<v Speaker 3>but if someone shoots up a high school or shoots up in elementary school,</v>

1684
01:15:01.750 --> 01:15:03.820
<v Speaker 3>it's like calling credit just doesn't work out.</v>

1685
01:15:03.821 --> 01:15:08.550
<v Speaker 3>It's because a criminal once your car you want your car to so you can understand</v>

1686
01:15:08.551 --> 01:15:09.220
<v Speaker 3>what a criminal is.</v>

1687
01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:11.260
<v Speaker 3>Just your approach is different,</v>

1688
01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:17.230
<v Speaker 3>but you don't want to do something like that.</v>

1689
01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:19.870
<v Speaker 3>Young man did when he showed up at the sandy hook elementary school,</v>

1690
01:15:19.871 --> 01:15:21.130
<v Speaker 3>that's a whole different issue.</v>

1691
01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:24.640
<v Speaker 3>The question is why people do that and the reason for that,</v>

1692
01:15:24.670 --> 01:15:28.930
<v Speaker 3>it's outlined very briefly in rule six succinctly,</v>

1693
01:15:28.931 --> 01:15:33.931
<v Speaker 3>is that while it has to do with the issue of failure and the and the tragedy of</v>

1694
01:15:34.151 --> 01:15:39.151
<v Speaker 3>life and rule six is also a discussion of the attitude that you need to develop</v>

1695
01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:42.700
<v Speaker 3>in the face of the tragedy of life.</v>

1696
01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:44.470
<v Speaker 3>So people,</v>

1697
01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:48.000
<v Speaker 3>people are bound by their vulnerability and their.</v>

1698
01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:51.970
<v Speaker 3>They're bound by their mortality and they're liable to be trained in her.</v>

1699
01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:54.880
<v Speaker 3>All of those things are canonical parts of existence.</v>

1700
01:15:54.881 --> 01:15:56.310
<v Speaker 3>Everyone experiences them.</v>

1701
01:15:56.620 --> 01:15:58.240
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it's self betrayal.</v>

1702
01:15:58.690 --> 01:15:59.470
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter.</v>

1703
01:15:59.470 --> 01:16:04.300
<v Speaker 3>It's still a reality of malevolence among people is a reality of the world as</v>

1704
01:16:04.301 --> 01:16:06.430
<v Speaker 3>this tragedy and that,</v>

1705
01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:08.770
<v Speaker 3>and that's true to some degree.</v>

1706
01:16:08.830 --> 01:16:10.900
<v Speaker 3>Even if you conduct yourself properly,</v>

1707
01:16:11.350 --> 01:16:11.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1708
01:16:11.830 --> 01:16:13.090
<v Speaker 3>and that's the old mystery.</v>

1709
01:16:13.140 --> 01:16:13.610
<v Speaker 3>Why couldn't it?</v>

1710
01:16:13.610 --> 01:16:16.780
<v Speaker 3>Things have to get quite a bad things happen to good people,</v>

1711
01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:18.640
<v Speaker 3>which is a deep question.</v>

1712
01:16:18.641 --> 01:16:20.110
<v Speaker 3>Everyone asks themselves that question.</v>

1713
01:16:20.111 --> 01:16:21.370
<v Speaker 3>When things go wrong in their life,</v>

1714
01:16:21.371 --> 01:16:25.120
<v Speaker 3>especially when they've been trying hard to set a trap and it can turn you</v>

1715
01:16:25.121 --> 01:16:25.954
<v Speaker 3>against life,</v>

1716
01:16:26.590 --> 01:16:30.220
<v Speaker 3>and the people who do these terrible crimes so to speak,</v>

1717
01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:35.200
<v Speaker 3>are people who be turned against you by and in a very deep sense,</v>

1718
01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:37.570
<v Speaker 3>in the deepest of all possible census.</v>

1719
01:16:37.570 --> 01:16:38.690
<v Speaker 3>They're turned against tax.</v>

1720
01:16:38.691 --> 01:16:40.030
<v Speaker 3>We in a religious sense,</v>

1721
01:16:40.170 --> 01:16:41.020
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

1722
01:16:41.260 --> 01:16:42.093
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>

1723
01:16:42.250 --> 01:16:46.020
<v Speaker 3>I can't take the time to explain precisely why that's the proper level analysis,</v>

1724
01:16:46.030 --> 01:16:46.580
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1725
01:16:46.580 --> 01:16:49.380
<v Speaker 3>but to think about it to,</v>

1726
01:16:49.390 --> 01:16:50.223
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1727
01:16:50.230 --> 01:16:52.030
<v Speaker 3>to answer the question,</v>

1728
01:16:52.810 --> 01:16:56.560
<v Speaker 3>why would someone shoot a classroom full of elementary school kids?</v>

1729
01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:59.200
<v Speaker 3>You have people weighing me down into things.</v>

1730
01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:04.000
<v Speaker 3>You have to go as deep as you possibly can into the mystery of human motivation</v>

1731
01:17:04.001 --> 01:17:06.820
<v Speaker 3>and the catastrophe of life way down at that level.</v>

1732
01:17:06.821 --> 01:17:10.190
<v Speaker 3>That's essentially the level that religious language designed to.</v>

1733
01:17:10.610 --> 01:17:14.960
<v Speaker 3>What would you say to communicate independently of your belief in a,</v>

1734
01:17:15.170 --> 01:17:15.770
<v Speaker 3>in a,</v>

1735
01:17:15.770 --> 01:17:16.220
<v Speaker 3>in a,</v>

1736
01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:16.521
<v Speaker 3>in a,</v>

1737
01:17:16.521 --> 01:17:17.041
<v Speaker 3>in a day,</v>

1738
01:17:17.041 --> 01:17:17.810
<v Speaker 3>and I come,</v>

1739
01:17:17.810 --> 01:17:19.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm making a psychological case here.</v>

1740
01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:24.200
<v Speaker 3>The people who committed these terrible crimes are embittered by lights and they</v>

1741
01:17:24.201 --> 01:17:28.560
<v Speaker 3>believe that just because up there and bitter but perhaps just compiled was</v>

1742
01:17:28.561 --> 01:17:31.040
<v Speaker 3>determined to at least to some degree because there's plenty of things to be</v>

1743
01:17:31.041 --> 01:17:35.640
<v Speaker 3>bitter about life that it's okay for them to act as universal judge would be and</v>

1744
01:17:35.641 --> 01:17:40.641
<v Speaker 3>to take her revenge and that's precisely what they're doing and I attempted to</v>

1745
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:45.810
<v Speaker 3>justify that because you cannot understand something until she could justify it</v>

1746
01:17:46.010 --> 01:17:51.010
<v Speaker 3>and then to produce a counter argument and the counterargument is yeah,</v>

1747
01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:57.110
<v Speaker 3>life extraordinarily difficult and people are subject to trap the tragedy of</v>

1748
01:17:57.111 --> 01:17:59.870
<v Speaker 3>their lives and to be trail and malevolence all of that.</v>

1749
01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:00.711
<v Speaker 3>And you might ask,</v>

1750
01:18:00.711 --> 01:18:02.450
<v Speaker 3>well why not be bitter?</v>

1751
01:18:02.990 --> 01:18:06.520
<v Speaker 3>And I think the answer to that is related to things we've already discussed this</v>

1752
01:18:06.521 --> 01:18:07.354
<v Speaker 3>to some degree.</v>

1753
01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:13.280
<v Speaker 3>What makes you think that you've done everything you possibly could to put</v>

1754
01:18:13.281 --> 01:18:15.710
<v Speaker 3>things right enough so that you're in a position to judge?</v>

1755
01:18:16.850 --> 01:18:20.510
<v Speaker 3>This is naturally an optimistic question and it relates to,</v>

1756
01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:21.271
<v Speaker 3>as I said,</v>

1757
01:18:21.271 --> 01:18:22.470
<v Speaker 3>the things that we discussed earlier.</v>

1758
01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:23.290
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

1759
01:18:23.290 --> 01:18:23.660
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

1760
01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:24.170
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

1761
01:18:24.170 --> 01:18:24.980
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

1762
01:18:24.980 --> 01:18:25.960
<v Speaker 3>there's a building,</v>

1763
01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:28.460
<v Speaker 3>there's a catastrophe built into each of our lives.</v>

1764
01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:30.170
<v Speaker 3>The fact that life is suffering.</v>

1765
01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:33.410
<v Speaker 3>The question is what's the appropriate attitude in the face of that,</v>

1766
01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:38.450
<v Speaker 3>and I would say absolutely everything you possibly can to fit to set things</v>

1767
01:18:38.451 --> 01:18:43.280
<v Speaker 3>right before you dared to stand up as the judge of everything that exists as a</v>

1768
01:18:43.281 --> 01:18:46.400
<v Speaker 3>temptation that everyone falls prey to at our thing,</v>

1769
01:18:46.401 --> 01:18:51.401
<v Speaker 3>to be optimistic and that is things can be a lot better than they are and your</v>

1770
01:18:51.951 --> 01:18:56.750
<v Speaker 3>capacity to make things a lot better than they are is far less limited than you</v>

1771
01:18:56.751 --> 01:18:59.750
<v Speaker 3>might fake regardless of your starting point.</v>

1772
01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:03.620
<v Speaker 3>You know when people have been criticizing me because I don't take</v>

1773
01:19:03.980 --> 01:19:08.980
<v Speaker 3>hypothetically the fact of differential socioeconomic advantage into account,</v>

1774
01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:10.330
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1775
01:19:10.330 --> 01:19:10.480
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1776
01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:11.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm not naive.</v>

1777
01:19:11.870 --> 01:19:15.280
<v Speaker 3>I know that some people are born with advantages that other people aren't.</v>

1778
01:19:15.330 --> 01:19:15.471
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1779
01:19:15.471 --> 01:19:19.700
<v Speaker 3>it's complicated because advantages are multidimensional and people generally</v>

1780
01:19:19.701 --> 01:19:21.350
<v Speaker 3>pay a price for their gifts,</v>

1781
01:19:21.351 --> 01:19:22.184
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

1782
01:19:22.190 --> 01:19:23.540
<v Speaker 3>so it's complicated,</v>

1783
01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:28.220
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't matter in some sense because regardless of the conditions of your</v>

1784
01:19:28.221 --> 01:19:28.731
<v Speaker 3>existence,</v>

1785
01:19:28.731 --> 01:19:30.500
<v Speaker 3>arbitrary as they are,</v>

1786
01:19:30.540 --> 01:19:33.830
<v Speaker 3>your best foot forward is to try to set things right as much as you possibly</v>

1787
01:19:33.831 --> 01:19:34.664
<v Speaker 3>can,</v>

1788
01:19:35.260 --> 01:19:35.780
<v Speaker 3>and there's a.</v>

1789
01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:36.310
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1790
01:19:36.310 --> 01:19:37.143
<v Speaker 3>it's and it's.</v>

1791
01:19:37.610 --> 01:19:39.340
<v Speaker 3>It's a courageous attitudes.</v>

1792
01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:39.900
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1793
01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:41.660
<v Speaker 3>it's your willingness in some sense,</v>

1794
01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:44.870
<v Speaker 3>to take responsibility for the conditions of life,</v>

1795
01:19:44.871 --> 01:19:49.580
<v Speaker 3>for the tragedy of life and for the malevolence of life to take responsibility</v>

1796
01:19:49.581 --> 01:19:49.680
<v Speaker 3>for.</v>

1797
01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:54.680
<v Speaker 3>That's unbelievably noble task in some sense because it's really.</v>

1798
01:19:54.950 --> 01:19:59.650
<v Speaker 3>It's really hard to do that just because you know that you're bound by</v>

1799
01:20:00.090 --> 01:20:01.510
<v Speaker 3>malevolence human level.</v>

1800
01:20:01.511 --> 01:20:04.070
<v Speaker 3>It's in the world and you might think,</v>

1801
01:20:04.071 --> 01:20:04.191
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1802
01:20:04.191 --> 01:20:05.650
<v Speaker 3>that's just too terrible to bear.</v>

1803
01:20:05.690 --> 01:20:06.021
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1804
01:20:06.021 --> 01:20:06.201
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1805
01:20:06.201 --> 01:20:06.501
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1806
01:20:06.501 --> 01:20:07.260
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>

1807
01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:08.093
<v Speaker 3>It is,</v>

1808
01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:09.240
<v Speaker 3>but that's not the point.</v>

1809
01:20:09.930 --> 01:20:10.381
<v Speaker 3>The point is,</v>

1810
01:20:10.381 --> 01:20:15.381
<v Speaker 3>your best strategy is to voluntarily accepted and again to stand up for your</v>

1811
01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:21.680
<v Speaker 3>shoulders back to Excentra vulnerability that's associated with your big and to</v>

1812
01:20:21.811 --> 01:20:26.190
<v Speaker 3>do everything you possibly can do transit to accept it and transcendent and to</v>

1813
01:20:26.191 --> 01:20:27.100
<v Speaker 3>work with constraint.</v>

1814
01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:28.230
<v Speaker 3>And malevolence in the world</v>

1815
01:20:35.940 --> 01:20:37.630
<v Speaker 2>I know</v>

1816
01:20:38.900 --> 01:20:40.440
<v Speaker 3>that might not take you to heaven</v>

1817
01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:43.700
<v Speaker 3>and perhaps doesn't exist</v>

1818
01:20:45.870 --> 01:20:47.260
<v Speaker 3>and if you don't think hell exists,</v>

1819
01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:48.993
<v Speaker 3>then you have,</v>

1820
01:20:49.660 --> 01:20:54.660
<v Speaker 3>what would I say if you haven't paid enough attention to the people around you</v>

1821
01:20:55.540 --> 01:21:00.420
<v Speaker 3>be you haven't paid enough attention to the worst parts of your existence and</v>

1822
01:21:00.490 --> 01:21:02.470
<v Speaker 3>see the BBC,</v>

1823
01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:06.520
<v Speaker 3>you have nearly enough history.</v>

1824
01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:08.510
<v Speaker 2>You ready</v>

1825
01:21:15.110 --> 01:21:19.990
<v Speaker 3>on creativity and so if you can avoid that,</v>

1826
01:21:20.060 --> 01:21:24.670
<v Speaker 3>something could be something for you because you don't need that and it would be</v>

1827
01:21:24.671 --> 01:21:27.460
<v Speaker 3>something for everyone else because we don't need that.</v>

1828
01:21:27.610 --> 01:21:30.620
<v Speaker 3>And I think even if we aren't capable creative Kevin,</v>

1829
01:21:31.450 --> 01:21:33.140
<v Speaker 3>we might be capable avoiding.</v>

1830
01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:38.230
<v Speaker 3>And that would be something that would be something to take away from the 20th</v>

1831
01:21:38.231 --> 01:21:38.861
<v Speaker 3>century now,</v>

1832
01:21:38.861 --> 01:21:39.280
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't it?</v>

1833
01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:43.980
<v Speaker 3>Because we generated plenty of hell during the 20th century if we want it to be.</v>

1834
01:21:44.030 --> 01:21:47.770
<v Speaker 3>We could wake up enough now in the aftermath of all that and fake.</v>

1835
01:21:47.771 --> 01:21:48.071
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1836
01:21:48.071 --> 01:21:49.600
<v Speaker 3>How about we don't do that again?</v>

1837
01:21:58.390 --> 01:21:59.920
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's an economic issue.</v>

1838
01:22:00.730 --> 01:22:02.050
<v Speaker 3>I think it's an ethical issue</v>

1839
01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:09.080
<v Speaker 3>of reading the causal pathways that lead to the horrors of Auschwitz.</v>

1840
01:22:09.581 --> 01:22:14.581
<v Speaker 3>Let's say reprehensible horse of a radical African places like start with this</v>

1841
01:22:16.420 --> 01:22:17.253
<v Speaker 3>union.</v>

1842
01:22:17.380 --> 01:22:22.380
<v Speaker 3>The reason that those situations became plausible was because of the failings of</v>

1843
01:22:22.631 --> 01:22:24.400
<v Speaker 3>the individuals who made up the society.</v>

1844
01:22:24.910 --> 01:22:26.380
<v Speaker 3>You can't blame it on the leader.</v>

1845
01:22:26.410 --> 01:22:28.240
<v Speaker 3>You can't blame it on economic conditions.</v>

1846
01:22:28.420 --> 01:22:29.253
<v Speaker 3>None of that.</v>

1847
01:22:29.740 --> 01:22:34.740
<v Speaker 3>It was that people consistently made the wrong choice at an individual level and</v>

1848
01:22:36.041 --> 01:22:39.390
<v Speaker 3>most profound commentators on those situations.</v>

1849
01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:40.171
<v Speaker 3>Viktor Frankl,</v>

1850
01:22:40.171 --> 01:22:40.900
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1851
01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:41.890
<v Speaker 3>how your social,</v>

1852
01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.280
<v Speaker 3>it's all fake.</v>

1853
01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:50.470
<v Speaker 3>It was the willingness of the average citizen to falsify their own experiences</v>

1854
01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:54.010
<v Speaker 3>in the service of ideological totalitarianism that turned into two countries</v>

1855
01:22:54.030 --> 01:22:54.730
<v Speaker 3>into help.</v>

1856
01:22:54.730 --> 01:22:59.730
<v Speaker 3>It was the lies that people told that they were telling me so well that would</v>

1857
01:23:00.791 --> 01:23:02.580
<v Speaker 3>lead us to rule eight.</v>

1858
01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:04.330
<v Speaker 3>I'll skip rule seven for now.</v>

1859
01:23:05.710 --> 01:23:06.580
<v Speaker 3>Tell the truth,</v>

1860
01:23:07.790 --> 01:23:11.000
<v Speaker 3>and I think I'll probably have with this one.</v>

1861
01:23:13.470 --> 01:23:14.303
<v Speaker 3>I'm</v>

1862
01:23:19.730 --> 01:23:20.563
<v Speaker 3>too</v>

1863
01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:22.593
<v Speaker 3>old.</v>

1864
01:23:25.220 --> 01:23:27.150
<v Speaker 3>You favorite</v>

1865
01:23:30.460 --> 01:23:31.293
<v Speaker 3>story.</v>

1866
01:23:34.460 --> 01:23:35.293
<v Speaker 3>This is</v>

1867
01:23:36.670 --> 01:23:37.930
<v Speaker 3>the greatest story.</v>

1868
01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:39.333
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1869
01:23:39.450 --> 01:23:40.283
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1870
01:23:40.630 --> 01:23:41.463
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1871
01:23:44.150 --> 01:23:47.770
<v Speaker 3>I did a series of lectures last year on genesis friend and they were</v>

1872
01:23:47.771 --> 01:23:52.030
<v Speaker 3>psychological lectures or psychological analysis of Genesis says I was trying to</v>

1873
01:23:52.031 --> 01:23:55.270
<v Speaker 3>move into the theological domain content.</v>

1874
01:23:55.330 --> 01:23:55.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

1875
01:23:55.810 --> 01:23:59.590
<v Speaker 3>it's not that I don't think that that's a relevant domain and I'm not trying to</v>

1876
01:23:59.591 --> 01:24:01.570
<v Speaker 3>deny the existence or or,</v>

1877
01:24:01.610 --> 01:24:03.910
<v Speaker 3>or speak for the existence of anything metaphysical.</v>

1878
01:24:05.110 --> 01:24:07.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to do that to people who do that.</v>

1879
01:24:07.940 --> 01:24:09.940
<v Speaker 3>It's fine and it maybe it needs to be done,</v>

1880
01:24:09.970 --> 01:24:11.430
<v Speaker 3>but I'm trying to do that.</v>

1881
01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:12.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to make sense out of these.</v>

1882
01:24:13.010 --> 01:24:14.140
<v Speaker 3>Stuart's now.</v>

1883
01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:18.610
<v Speaker 3>My sense is that our deep stories are myth,</v>

1884
01:24:19.030 --> 01:24:19.810
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

1885
01:24:19.810 --> 01:24:20.621
<v Speaker 3>which are everywhere.</v>

1886
01:24:20.621 --> 01:24:20.990
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

1887
01:24:20.990 --> 01:24:23.440
<v Speaker 3>that not only encapsulated the biblical stories.</v>

1888
01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:24.750
<v Speaker 3>You guys all go to movies,</v>

1889
01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:27.870
<v Speaker 3>you go watch the marvel superheros.</v>

1890
01:24:27.970 --> 01:24:29.260
<v Speaker 3>You don't think that's an anthology.</v>

1891
01:24:29.260 --> 01:24:31.270
<v Speaker 3>It's just because we don't know anything about mythology.</v>

1892
01:24:31.390 --> 01:24:32.440
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's what it is.</v>

1893
01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:33.320
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1894
01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:34.840
<v Speaker 3>when you watch Harry Potter,</v>

1895
01:24:34.870 --> 01:24:35.770
<v Speaker 3>here's what you watch.</v>

1896
01:24:36.580 --> 01:24:37.413
<v Speaker 3>You Watch,</v>

1897
01:24:38.770 --> 01:24:41.410
<v Speaker 3>you watch a diamond resurrected,</v>

1898
01:24:41.450 --> 01:24:43.570
<v Speaker 3>erode defeated fig figure of evil.</v>

1899
01:24:44.460 --> 01:24:45.910
<v Speaker 3>That's the Harry Potter story,</v>

1900
01:24:46.750 --> 01:24:51.750
<v Speaker 3>so and it makes sense to you and your kids read it and it generates millions of</v>

1901
01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:51.881
<v Speaker 3>dollars.</v>

1902
01:24:51.881 --> 01:24:52.270
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1903
01:24:52.270 --> 01:24:52.480
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1904
01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:53.313
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

1905
01:24:53.660 --> 01:24:53.800
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1906
01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:55.420
<v Speaker 3>it's because it's true.</v>

1907
01:24:55.780 --> 01:24:56.800
<v Speaker 3>Now how it's true,</v>

1908
01:24:56.830 --> 01:24:57.730
<v Speaker 3>that's complicated.</v>

1909
01:24:57.731 --> 01:24:59.590
<v Speaker 3>That's a whole different can of worms,</v>

1910
01:24:59.591 --> 01:25:00.424
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

1911
01:25:00.430 --> 01:25:01.300
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1912
01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:02.313
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

1913
01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:03.790
<v Speaker 3>you see it as well.</v>

1914
01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:05.490
<v Speaker 3>The director resurrecting hero,</v>

1915
01:25:05.990 --> 01:25:09.410
<v Speaker 3>redeemed his father and becomes the genuine individual.</v>

1916
01:25:09.411 --> 01:25:10.990
<v Speaker 3>When you go watch that with your kids,</v>

1917
01:25:11.030 --> 01:25:11.420
<v Speaker 3>you think,</v>

1918
01:25:11.420 --> 01:25:11.610
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1919
01:25:11.610 --> 01:25:13.300
<v Speaker 3>that's right and you don't care that,</v>

1920
01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:13.510
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1921
01:25:13.510 --> 01:25:14.343
<v Speaker 3>it's a puppet.</v>

1922
01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:18.430
<v Speaker 3>And then he goes and rescues his father from a whale and then none of that makes</v>

1923
01:25:18.431 --> 01:25:21.670
<v Speaker 3>sense that there's a blue farian talked to my cricket.</v>

1924
01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:22.870
<v Speaker 3>You don't care about any of that.</v>

1925
01:25:22.990 --> 01:25:23.261
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1926
01:25:23.261 --> 01:25:23.561
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

1927
01:25:23.561 --> 01:25:24.480
<v Speaker 3>that's no problem.</v>

1928
01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:26.830
<v Speaker 3>I can see how that would work</v>

1929
01:25:28.570 --> 01:25:31.570
<v Speaker 3>because you have a mythological imagination and it's,</v>

1930
01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:35.630
<v Speaker 3>it's your thought is embedded inside that mythological imagination in the data</v>

1931
01:25:35.631 --> 01:25:37.810
<v Speaker 3>and that I think are essentially crystal clear.</v>

1932
01:25:38.140 --> 01:25:38.501
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1933
01:25:38.501 --> 01:25:38.711
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1934
01:25:38.711 --> 01:25:39.820
<v Speaker 3>so let me tell you a story.</v>

1935
01:25:40.060 --> 01:25:44.650
<v Speaker 3>So the fundamental mythological world is something like this,</v>

1936
01:25:44.940 --> 01:25:45.810
<v Speaker 3>something like this,</v>

1937
01:25:45.811 --> 01:25:46.370
<v Speaker 3>and you're,</v>

1938
01:25:46.370 --> 01:25:49.030
<v Speaker 3>you're specialized neurologically to operate in this world,</v>

1939
01:25:49.031 --> 01:25:51.880
<v Speaker 3>and so part of the world is chaotic domain.</v>

1940
01:25:52.900 --> 01:25:55.180
<v Speaker 3>That's why I call my book an antidote to chaos.</v>

1941
01:25:55.300 --> 01:25:58.510
<v Speaker 3>The chaotic moon beam is the place that you are when you don't know what's going</v>

1942
01:25:58.511 --> 01:25:58.751
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

1943
01:25:58.751 --> 01:26:00.280
<v Speaker 3>but it's a place of potential.</v>

1944
01:26:00.340 --> 01:26:00.920
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

1945
01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:01.860
<v Speaker 3>You can think about it.</v>

1946
01:26:03.180 --> 01:26:04.013
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.</v>

1947
01:26:04.150 --> 01:26:05.870
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to explain this quickly.</v>

1948
01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:11.080
<v Speaker 3>Here's the way you're thinking about this is this is how I think people work.</v>

1949
01:26:11.180 --> 01:26:14.040
<v Speaker 3>This is how I think that you can understand the role of consciousness in the</v>

1950
01:26:14.041 --> 01:26:14.220
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

1951
01:26:14.220 --> 01:26:18.890
<v Speaker 3>so I think that we're not driven in a deterministic way.</v>

1952
01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:23.360
<v Speaker 3>The way that materialistic entities are hypothetically driven.</v>

1953
01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:24.260
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1954
01:26:24.260 --> 01:26:26.000
<v Speaker 3>I think this is what happens in step.</v>

1955
01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:29.120
<v Speaker 3>I think that each of us is a locus of consciousness.</v>

1956
01:26:29.250 --> 01:26:32.360
<v Speaker 3>We started the act like we are in the treat each other like we are and we assume</v>

1957
01:26:32.361 --> 01:26:35.120
<v Speaker 3>that we are so I'm just going to assume that that's the case and what</v>

1958
01:26:35.121 --> 01:26:40.121
<v Speaker 3>consciousness does not fall prey to the deterministic machinations up.</v>

1959
01:26:40.850 --> 01:26:42.200
<v Speaker 3>It's materials don't substrate,</v>

1960
01:26:42.290 --> 01:26:43.123
<v Speaker 3>but the face,</v>

1961
01:26:43.250 --> 01:26:44.960
<v Speaker 3>the potential of the future,</v>

1962
01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:48.260
<v Speaker 3>and to make decisions about which of those potentials are going to realize</v>

1963
01:26:48.261 --> 01:26:49.094
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>

1964
01:26:49.730 --> 01:26:50.391
<v Speaker 3>So when these make.</v>

1965
01:26:50.391 --> 01:26:52.970
<v Speaker 3>When you think about how you think you are like,</v>

1966
01:26:53.150 --> 01:26:53.361
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1967
01:26:53.361 --> 01:26:57.170
<v Speaker 3>the way you think you are is that you get up in the morning and there's a bunch</v>

1968
01:26:57.171 --> 01:27:01.000
<v Speaker 3>of potential things that are arrayed themselves in front of you and then you</v>

1969
01:27:01.020 --> 01:27:04.100
<v Speaker 3>decide which of those makes or you're going to do and which of those things</v>

1970
01:27:04.101 --> 01:27:08.990
<v Speaker 3>you're going to call them into being an and you assume that other people do that</v>

1971
01:27:08.991 --> 01:27:09.860
<v Speaker 3>and if they don't do that,</v>

1972
01:27:09.861 --> 01:27:12.980
<v Speaker 3>you actually get angry at because you'd say to your wife,</v>

1973
01:27:12.981 --> 01:27:13.191
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

1974
01:27:13.191 --> 01:27:13.461
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

1975
01:27:13.461 --> 01:27:13.611
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1976
01:27:13.611 --> 01:27:16.400
<v Speaker 3>you said you were going to do such and such,</v>

1977
01:27:16.790 --> 01:27:20.760
<v Speaker 3>which means to manifest a certain kind of potential and bring them up to a</v>

1978
01:27:20.761 --> 01:27:23.810
<v Speaker 3>certain reality and you get what's wrong with you.</v>

1979
01:27:23.900 --> 01:27:24.531
<v Speaker 3>And she'll say,</v>

1980
01:27:24.531 --> 01:27:24.801
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1981
01:27:24.801 --> 01:27:25.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1982
01:27:25.460 --> 01:27:27.140
<v Speaker 3>maybe she'll tell you a reason or maybe she'll say,</v>

1983
01:27:27.141 --> 01:27:27.471
<v Speaker 3>well that.</v>

1984
01:27:27.471 --> 01:27:27.831
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>

1985
01:27:27.831 --> 01:27:29.600
<v Speaker 3>because I know that you were relying on me.</v>

1986
01:27:29.860 --> 01:27:31.460
<v Speaker 3>And so you treat people like that.</v>

1987
01:27:31.461 --> 01:27:35.990
<v Speaker 3>So there's a domain of potential that's chaos and there's a domain of mortar and</v>

1988
01:27:35.991 --> 01:27:39.770
<v Speaker 3>that's what the chaos is transformed into when you interact with it.</v>

1989
01:27:40.610 --> 01:27:41.060
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

1990
01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:42.170
<v Speaker 3>So those are the domains.</v>

1991
01:27:42.171 --> 01:27:42.440
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1992
01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:46.940
<v Speaker 3>here's what happens at the beginning of genesis in our most fundamental creation</v>

1993
01:27:46.941 --> 01:27:47.181
<v Speaker 3>story,</v>

1994
01:27:47.181 --> 01:27:48.830
<v Speaker 3>the most fundamental gracious towards the West.</v>

1995
01:27:49.100 --> 01:27:50.660
<v Speaker 3>You have these three domains.</v>

1996
01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:51.950
<v Speaker 3>You have the potential.</v>

1997
01:27:51.980 --> 01:27:56.870
<v Speaker 3>It's the chaos that goes on two fronts at the beginning of time and whatever God</v>

1998
01:27:56.871 --> 01:28:00.950
<v Speaker 3>is going to think about him as the spirit of consciousness for the sake of</v>

1999
01:28:00.951 --> 01:28:01.784
<v Speaker 3>argument,</v>

2000
01:28:01.790 --> 01:28:06.790
<v Speaker 3>he uses logos to interact with potential and to create a habit in order for.</v>

2001
01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:08.950
<v Speaker 3>That's Jeff.</v>

2002
01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:10.160
<v Speaker 3>That's the first part of Genesis,</v>

2003
01:28:10.161 --> 01:28:15.161
<v Speaker 3>and so what happens is God speaks and potential rearranges itself into order and</v>

2004
01:28:16.371 --> 01:28:17.031
<v Speaker 3>then go and says,</v>

2005
01:28:17.031 --> 01:28:17.181
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2006
01:28:17.181 --> 01:28:18.014
<v Speaker 3>that order is good.</v>

2007
01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:18.711
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2008
01:28:18.711 --> 01:28:20.990
<v Speaker 3>so there's an ethical proposition there too.</v>

2009
01:28:21.050 --> 01:28:22.280
<v Speaker 3>It's a very deep proposition,</v>

2010
01:28:22.281 --> 01:28:23.030
<v Speaker 3>and here's,</v>

2011
01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:24.140
<v Speaker 3>here's something to think about.</v>

2012
01:28:25.370 --> 01:28:29.660
<v Speaker 3>The proposition is that if you confront protection with the truth,</v>

2013
01:28:29.661 --> 01:28:31.610
<v Speaker 3>that the order you generate is good.</v>

2014
01:28:32.180 --> 01:28:33.490
<v Speaker 3>It's a proposition.</v>

2015
01:28:33.950 --> 01:28:34.281
<v Speaker 3>You think,</v>

2016
01:28:34.281 --> 01:28:34.400
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2017
01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:35.810
<v Speaker 3>he's being good.</v>

2018
01:28:35.900 --> 01:28:38.860
<v Speaker 3>While it's a hard question because it's full of tragedy and malevolence like,</v>

2019
01:28:38.861 --> 01:28:39.770
<v Speaker 3>is it good?</v>

2020
01:28:40.650 --> 01:28:42.230
<v Speaker 3>If that's a hard question,</v>

2021
01:28:42.410 --> 01:28:42.591
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2022
01:28:42.591 --> 01:28:44.900
<v Speaker 3>without the malevolence it might be a lot better.</v>

2023
01:28:44.901 --> 01:28:48.290
<v Speaker 3>So that's something and fair bit of that is generated as a consequence of</v>

2024
01:28:48.620 --> 01:28:49.580
<v Speaker 3>deceit,</v>

2025
01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:52.160
<v Speaker 3>as a consequence of deviation from the truth.</v>

2026
01:28:52.220 --> 01:28:53.180
<v Speaker 3>So you might ask yourself,</v>

2027
01:28:53.181 --> 01:28:53.720
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2028
01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:58.720
<v Speaker 3>how would things be if people did nothing but tell the truth and that</v>

2029
01:28:58.851 --> 01:29:00.170
<v Speaker 3>proposition is inhibited.</v>

2030
01:29:00.220 --> 01:29:02.340
<v Speaker 3>Genesis is thing that it would be good.</v>

2031
01:29:02.610 --> 01:29:03.443
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

2032
01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:07.530
<v Speaker 3>that's reasonable hypothesis because you know,</v>

2033
01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:09.180
<v Speaker 3>when I've worked with my clients,</v>

2034
01:29:09.181 --> 01:29:09.781
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

2035
01:29:09.781 --> 01:29:10.830
<v Speaker 3>for all of these steps,</v>

2036
01:29:11.590 --> 01:29:16.380
<v Speaker 3>what I see is it the people that were hurt the worst aren't hurt because</v>

2037
01:29:16.381 --> 01:29:17.610
<v Speaker 3>something terrible happened to them.</v>

2038
01:29:18.030 --> 01:29:18.960
<v Speaker 3>It's not cancer,</v>

2039
01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:19.860
<v Speaker 3>it's not an earthquake,</v>

2040
01:29:21.620 --> 01:29:22.453
<v Speaker 3>it's not an academic,</v>

2041
01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:26.710
<v Speaker 3>it's that somebody to them with attending.</v>

2042
01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:30.180
<v Speaker 3>And if you look at the literature on posttraumatic stress disorder,</v>

2043
01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:33.510
<v Speaker 3>it's quite clear that what really breaks people,</v>

2044
01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:37.250
<v Speaker 3>his betrayal and deceit on the partner of someone they trust.</v>

2045
01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:38.760
<v Speaker 3>And that might be to the south,</v>

2046
01:29:38.780 --> 01:29:39.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2047
01:29:39.010 --> 01:29:39.740
<v Speaker 3>you can do that too.</v>

2048
01:29:39.740 --> 01:29:41.280
<v Speaker 3>So that's no problem that happens.</v>

2049
01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:45.120
<v Speaker 3>So it's not a tragedy into the World Pacific catastrophe,</v>

2050
01:29:45.121 --> 01:29:46.440
<v Speaker 3>even though it is a catastrophe,</v>

2051
01:29:46.441 --> 01:29:49.200
<v Speaker 3>it's the level of the world that's a catastrophe.</v>

2052
01:29:49.410 --> 01:29:50.540
<v Speaker 3>And that's probably see.</v>

2053
01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:56.120
<v Speaker 3>And so the second part of Genesis has another hypothesis embedded in it,</v>

2054
01:29:56.371 --> 01:29:59.840
<v Speaker 3>and now that man and woman are made in the but you've gone.</v>

2055
01:30:00.150 --> 01:30:00.751
<v Speaker 3>The question is,</v>

2056
01:30:00.751 --> 01:30:00.871
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2057
01:30:00.871 --> 01:30:03.780
<v Speaker 3>what does that mean as far as I can tell them?</v>

2058
01:30:03.781 --> 01:30:08.781
<v Speaker 3>What it means is if on the largest possible scale what's happening to generate</v>

2059
01:30:11.191 --> 01:30:15.810
<v Speaker 3>the world is the Kale and consciousness is interacting with potential to</v>

2060
01:30:15.811 --> 01:30:17.130
<v Speaker 3>generate order.</v>

2061
01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:22.620
<v Speaker 3>Then that's reflected in the house at a smaller level.</v>

2062
01:30:22.920 --> 01:30:25.430
<v Speaker 3>So each of us are also doing that on a scale,</v>

2063
01:30:26.550 --> 01:30:27.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2064
01:30:27.090 --> 01:30:29.950
<v Speaker 3>individual in humans and that</v>

2065
01:30:32.580 --> 01:30:37.020
<v Speaker 3>requires your society to assume that you have intrinsic value.</v>

2066
01:30:37.740 --> 01:30:39.660
<v Speaker 3>And that's at the basis of our legal system.</v>

2067
01:30:39.661 --> 01:30:40.371
<v Speaker 3>It really is.</v>

2068
01:30:40.371 --> 01:30:40.610
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2069
01:30:40.610 --> 01:30:43.080
<v Speaker 3>the idea that what we're all equal before the law,</v>

2070
01:30:43.090 --> 01:30:45.870
<v Speaker 3>whatever the hell that means you have intrinsic rights unnecessarily.</v>

2071
01:30:46.050 --> 01:30:49.920
<v Speaker 3>Responsibilities is predicated on the idea that there's something a little bit</v>

2072
01:30:49.921 --> 01:30:50.910
<v Speaker 3>so valuable,</v>

2073
01:30:50.940 --> 01:30:54.240
<v Speaker 3>but even the state has to keep his distance from you.</v>

2074
01:30:54.300 --> 01:30:56.640
<v Speaker 3>And the reason for that is because it was so special.</v>

2075
01:30:56.700 --> 01:30:58.410
<v Speaker 3>Even though that isn't part of the reason,</v>

2076
01:30:58.440 --> 01:31:03.180
<v Speaker 3>the reason he hasn't found its interferes too much with the individual than the</v>

2077
01:31:03.181 --> 01:31:07.860
<v Speaker 3>state itself collapses and that's true because the individual is the forest that</v>

2078
01:31:07.861 --> 01:31:12.150
<v Speaker 3>renews to stay and so the stage is stay the hell away from them individually</v>

2079
01:31:12.550 --> 01:31:15.050
<v Speaker 2>doesn't.</v>

2080
01:31:25.820 --> 01:31:29.550
<v Speaker 3>Let's say it was free speech isn't because I'm a defender of free speed.</v>

2081
01:31:29.610 --> 01:31:34.610
<v Speaker 3>It's because I know you haven't divine obligation to speak your truth in the</v>

2082
01:31:36.781 --> 01:31:37.650
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

2083
01:31:37.830 --> 01:31:42.830
<v Speaker 3>so that transforms itself into the order that isn't good and then no one has the</v>

2084
01:31:43.861 --> 01:31:46.380
<v Speaker 3>right to interfere with that period,</v>

2085
01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:47.633
<v Speaker 3>no matter</v>

2086
01:31:56.510 --> 01:31:58.190
<v Speaker 3>Humboldt chapter as well.</v>

2087
01:31:58.191 --> 01:31:59.950
<v Speaker 3>In the spirit of improvement,</v>

2088
01:32:00.250 --> 01:32:00.671
<v Speaker 3>I could say,</v>

2089
01:32:00.671 --> 01:32:00.881
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2090
01:32:00.881 --> 01:32:03.400
<v Speaker 3>don't I can say tell the truth.</v>

2091
01:32:03.670 --> 01:32:04.060
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2092
01:32:04.060 --> 01:32:04.211
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2093
01:32:04.211 --> 01:32:04.500
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2094
01:32:04.500 --> 01:32:05.560
<v Speaker 3>what the hell you know,</v>

2095
01:32:05.561 --> 01:32:06.361
<v Speaker 3>and what do I know?</v>

2096
01:32:06.361 --> 01:32:10.270
<v Speaker 3>It looks like we're all making urine to a degree that's almost indeterminable.</v>

2097
01:32:10.271 --> 01:32:12.070
<v Speaker 3>And so what do you know about telling the truth?</v>

2098
01:32:12.340 --> 01:32:12.521
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2099
01:32:12.521 --> 01:32:13.120
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2100
01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:14.680
<v Speaker 3>because you don't know enough to tell the truth,</v>

2101
01:32:14.730 --> 01:32:15.340
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2102
01:32:15.340 --> 01:32:18.520
<v Speaker 3>but maybe you could stumble towards the truth.</v>

2103
01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:21.970
<v Speaker 3>And so that's the message of Chapter Eight will tell the truth,</v>

2104
01:32:21.971 --> 01:32:24.340
<v Speaker 3>or at least don't lie,</v>

2105
01:32:24.910 --> 01:32:25.960
<v Speaker 3>because I could say,</v>

2106
01:32:26.010 --> 01:32:26.501
<v Speaker 3>and I look,</v>

2107
01:32:26.501 --> 01:32:27.250
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

2108
01:32:27.250 --> 01:32:30.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe that there's a person in this room</v>

2109
01:32:30.910 --> 01:32:31.743
<v Speaker 2>who</v>

2110
01:32:33.210 --> 01:32:34.043
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't</v>

2111
01:32:35.260 --> 01:32:38.470
<v Speaker 3>feel in their heart the truth of this proposition.</v>

2112
01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:45.610
<v Speaker 3>There are things that you say sometimes that you know to be true and you can</v>

2113
01:32:45.611 --> 01:32:46.444
<v Speaker 3>feel that.</v>

2114
01:32:46.630 --> 01:32:48.190
<v Speaker 3>I mean sometimes you don't know.</v>

2115
01:32:48.191 --> 01:32:49.570
<v Speaker 3>You just don't know what the hell you're talking about.</v>

2116
01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:51.490
<v Speaker 3>You can't tell if it's true or false or whatever.</v>

2117
01:32:51.491 --> 01:32:55.060
<v Speaker 3>You just here to Hampton or chaotic or ignorant or whatever.</v>

2118
01:32:55.061 --> 01:32:55.841
<v Speaker 3>You just can't tell.</v>

2119
01:32:55.841 --> 01:32:59.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm not talking about the times when you might be an error and don't go it.</v>

2120
01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:02.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about the times when you actually say something that you know to be</v>

2121
01:33:02.231 --> 01:33:04.360
<v Speaker 3>false and you say it.</v>

2122
01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:05.410
<v Speaker 3>Then the question is,</v>

2123
01:33:05.410 --> 01:33:06.580
<v Speaker 3>why do you say it?</v>

2124
01:33:07.090 --> 01:33:07.923
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2125
01:33:08.110 --> 01:33:11.310
<v Speaker 3>part of it is you want to get your way and achieved map.</v>

2126
01:33:11.380 --> 01:33:15.070
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to do the work that's necessary to get what you need in the way</v>

2127
01:33:15.071 --> 01:33:15.681
<v Speaker 3>that you shouldn't get.</v>

2128
01:33:15.681 --> 01:33:16.810
<v Speaker 3>If you want to take the shortcut.</v>

2129
01:33:17.380 --> 01:33:17.830
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2130
01:33:17.830 --> 01:33:21.630
<v Speaker 3>well that's not very bright because there's no shortcuts in reality and there's</v>

2131
01:33:21.640 --> 01:33:22.510
<v Speaker 3>a real,</v>

2132
01:33:22.630 --> 01:33:26.410
<v Speaker 3>a really remarkable spirit underlying that which is an arrogant spirit which</v>

2133
01:33:26.411 --> 01:33:31.411
<v Speaker 3>believes that somehow you have the capacity to bend the structure of reality to</v>

2134
01:33:31.691 --> 01:33:36.100
<v Speaker 3>favor you in a false manner and that that will actually work.</v>

2135
01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:37.990
<v Speaker 3>It's like that won't work.</v>

2136
01:33:38.110 --> 01:33:38.921
<v Speaker 3>It's not gonna work.</v>

2137
01:33:38.921 --> 01:33:39.790
<v Speaker 3>You can't do that.</v>

2138
01:33:39.820 --> 01:33:40.690
<v Speaker 3>It isn't gonna happen.</v>

2139
01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:41.980
<v Speaker 3>So but the.</v>

2140
01:33:41.980 --> 01:33:45.880
<v Speaker 3>But there's an arrogance underlying that misuse of language that's predicated on</v>

2141
01:33:45.881 --> 01:33:47.890
<v Speaker 3>the proposition that you actually have that power.</v>

2142
01:33:48.140 --> 01:33:49.310
<v Speaker 3>I think that through.</v>

2143
01:33:49.420 --> 01:33:50.230
<v Speaker 3>It's so.</v>

2144
01:33:50.230 --> 01:33:51.700
<v Speaker 3>It's so unlikely is it?</v>

2145
01:33:51.701 --> 01:33:53.250
<v Speaker 3>That would be the case that I,</v>

2146
01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:57.030
<v Speaker 3>that anybody clearheaded who actually thought that through and sees believing a</v>

2147
01:33:57.031 --> 01:33:57.864
<v Speaker 3>fairly rapidly,</v>

2148
01:33:58.400 --> 01:33:59.233
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

2149
01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:03.753
<v Speaker 2>true,</v>

2150
01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:06.420
<v Speaker 3>and you know what's wrong too.</v>

2151
01:34:07.350 --> 01:34:09.280
<v Speaker 3>And so what chapter eight is,</v>

2152
01:34:09.281 --> 01:34:12.580
<v Speaker 3>it's another question along the lines of incremental improvement.</v>

2153
01:34:14.050 --> 01:34:17.470
<v Speaker 3>Try not to say things that you know to be true.</v>

2154
01:34:17.770 --> 01:34:21.760
<v Speaker 3>The lie stopped going and see what happens</v>

2155
01:34:23.830 --> 01:34:27.220
<v Speaker 3>and then you're stumbling towards the truth and if it is the case,</v>

2156
01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:30.160
<v Speaker 3>as our deepest stories indicate that,</v>

2157
01:34:30.161 --> 01:34:30.730
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2158
01:34:30.730 --> 01:34:31.420
<v Speaker 3>that the,</v>

2159
01:34:31.420 --> 01:34:33.600
<v Speaker 3>that the order that is good to end,</v>

2160
01:34:33.610 --> 01:34:36.550
<v Speaker 3>habitable is established by truth.</v>

2161
01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:40.810
<v Speaker 3>Then if you start whining and order that you bring into being from the potential</v>

2162
01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:43.810
<v Speaker 3>that you can front will be the best possible order.</v>

2163
01:34:44.170 --> 01:34:44.441
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

2164
01:34:44.441 --> 01:34:45.010
<v Speaker 3>it's a.</v>

2165
01:34:45.010 --> 01:34:45.970
<v Speaker 3>it's an element of faith.</v>

2166
01:34:45.971 --> 01:34:47.610
<v Speaker 3>It's the most profound faith.</v>

2167
01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:49.790
<v Speaker 3>The idea would be at risk.</v>

2168
01:34:49.810 --> 01:34:52.910
<v Speaker 3>You have to take an existential risk because there's no proving it beforehand.</v>

2169
01:34:53.260 --> 01:34:56.950
<v Speaker 3>You have to act out the proposition that the world that you bring into being as</v>

2170
01:34:56.951 --> 01:35:01.310
<v Speaker 3>a of align yourself with truth is the best of all possible worlds would say</v>

2171
01:35:01.311 --> 01:35:04.490
<v Speaker 3>we'll make the experiment to find out because I think you already know.</v>

2172
01:35:04.490 --> 01:35:05.720
<v Speaker 3>I think everyone knows this,</v>

2173
01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:10.960
<v Speaker 3>that the world you bring into being as a consequence of deceit is definitely not</v>

2174
01:35:11.031 --> 01:35:14.350
<v Speaker 3>the world that you wanted would have and certainly not world you want.</v>

2175
01:35:14.900 --> 01:35:17.900
<v Speaker 3>If everyone is doing that because the world you would have been,</v>

2176
01:35:17.901 --> 01:35:19.970
<v Speaker 3>if everyone is doing that is hell,</v>

2177
01:35:20.630 --> 01:35:23.410
<v Speaker 3>and if you do hit with hail,</v>

2178
01:35:23.510 --> 01:35:25.490
<v Speaker 3>let's say thinking about East Germany,</v>

2179
01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:27.290
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2180
01:35:27.290 --> 01:35:30.250
<v Speaker 3>So here's the situation in East Germany before the wall fell down,</v>

2181
01:35:30.830 --> 01:35:32.330
<v Speaker 3>if you live in east Germany,</v>

2182
01:35:32.970 --> 01:35:37.540
<v Speaker 3>onenote was three people was acting as a government informer to regroup.</v>

2183
01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:40.940
<v Speaker 3>So what that means is if you had a family of six people,</v>

2184
01:35:41.870 --> 01:35:46.870
<v Speaker 3>two people in your family were willing to do the government.</v>

2185
01:35:47.990 --> 01:35:50.270
<v Speaker 3>They were actively engaged in that process.</v>

2186
01:35:51.380 --> 01:35:54.470
<v Speaker 3>And if you don't think that that's healthy and you don't know anything about</v>

2187
01:35:54.471 --> 01:35:58.910
<v Speaker 3>East Germany because that was magnified,</v>

2188
01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:01.100
<v Speaker 3>say across the entire Soviet Union,</v>

2189
01:36:01.130 --> 01:36:03.430
<v Speaker 3>it was a 25,</v>

2190
01:36:03.450 --> 01:36:05.780
<v Speaker 3>30 million people by deadly.</v>

2191
01:36:06.380 --> 01:36:11.090
<v Speaker 3>They were dance school fraction of the people who were brutalized and destroyed</v>

2192
01:36:11.091 --> 01:36:11.924
<v Speaker 3>by that system.</v>

2193
01:36:14.450 --> 01:36:19.450
<v Speaker 3>So it's actually this chapter because I think that's so interesting is that if</v>

2194
01:36:20.751 --> 01:36:22.400
<v Speaker 3>you look hard enough at the darkness,</v>

2195
01:36:22.401 --> 01:36:23.420
<v Speaker 3>you start to see the light.</v>

2196
01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:25.910
<v Speaker 3>Because if you look hard enough at the darkness,</v>

2197
01:36:25.911 --> 01:36:28.500
<v Speaker 3>you start to see what the opposite of the darkness.</v>

2198
01:36:29.710 --> 01:36:31.550
<v Speaker 3>And then it's easier to see the darkness.</v>

2199
01:36:31.551 --> 01:36:33.710
<v Speaker 3>In some sense it's even easier to believe in it.</v>

2200
01:36:33.740 --> 01:36:35.540
<v Speaker 3>But if you see it clearly enough and you're thinking,</v>

2201
01:36:35.541 --> 01:36:35.701
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2202
01:36:35.701 --> 01:36:40.660
<v Speaker 3>whatever the light is is it's as far away from that as you can get.</v>

2203
01:36:41.090 --> 01:36:45.140
<v Speaker 3>And when you see the Great Totalitarian Society from the Twentieth Century were</v>

2204
01:36:45.141 --> 01:36:47.780
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally predicated upon the lie.</v>

2205
01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:52.130
<v Speaker 3>Then after go to that support and clear stop line,</v>

2206
01:36:52.550 --> 01:36:53.610
<v Speaker 3>someone should mention Sandra,</v>

2207
01:36:54.020 --> 01:36:58.720
<v Speaker 3>one starts lying can bring down a tyranny and you're thinking,</v>

2208
01:36:58.820 --> 01:36:58.950
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2209
01:36:58.950 --> 01:37:00.320
<v Speaker 3>that can't possibly be true.</v>

2210
01:37:00.350 --> 01:37:03.950
<v Speaker 3>It's like I wouldn't be so sure about that.</v>

2211
01:37:04.660 --> 01:37:05.450
<v Speaker 3>Like the truth,</v>

2212
01:37:05.450 --> 01:37:06.760
<v Speaker 3>if the truth is a lie,</v>

2213
01:37:07.100 --> 01:37:08.720
<v Speaker 3>reality itself,</v>

2214
01:37:09.670 --> 01:37:12.340
<v Speaker 3>and what makes you think it's stackable.</v>

2215
01:37:12.740 --> 01:37:16.640
<v Speaker 3>It's not like reality is if you align yourself with the truth that you ever</v>

2216
01:37:16.641 --> 01:37:17.870
<v Speaker 3>reality behind,</v>

2217
01:37:17.871 --> 01:37:18.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2218
01:37:18.741 --> 01:37:19.970
<v Speaker 3>if you're having trouble</v>

2219
01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:24.410
<v Speaker 3>in your corner as probably a good idea</v>

2220
01:37:35.670 --> 01:37:39.360
<v Speaker 3>of the things that you're just in an articulate manner in the west,</v>

2221
01:37:40.830 --> 01:37:44.600
<v Speaker 3>unabashed admirer of Western civilization,</v>

2222
01:37:44.690 --> 01:37:45.523
<v Speaker 3>despite</v>

2223
01:37:54.370 --> 01:37:59.370
<v Speaker 3>harbor pop are rapidly bringing to everywhere in the world and saying,</v>

2224
01:37:59.970 --> 01:38:00.601
<v Speaker 3>going for that.</v>

2225
01:38:00.601 --> 01:38:02.910
<v Speaker 3>And I say 10 minutes for that is clear.</v>

2226
01:38:03.090 --> 01:38:05.930
<v Speaker 3>Now that doesn't mean we don't have our problems and now doesn't mean we should</v>

2227
01:38:06.540 --> 01:38:10.890
<v Speaker 3>know about it because it's not like we all generated western civilization.</v>

2228
01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:13.420
<v Speaker 3>It was there before it goes to the board,</v>

2229
01:38:13.850 --> 01:38:15.070
<v Speaker 3>so there's a lot of,</v>

2230
01:38:16.020 --> 01:38:16.853
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2231
01:38:16.890 --> 01:38:18.570
<v Speaker 3>what do I see as possibilities?</v>

2232
01:38:18.660 --> 01:38:22.740
<v Speaker 3>I see unfolding in front of us a world that rapidly improving,</v>

2233
01:38:23.920 --> 01:38:24.753
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

2234
01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:26.490
<v Speaker 3>we're becoming rapidly,</v>

2235
01:38:26.740 --> 01:38:29.030
<v Speaker 3>insanely technologically powerful,</v>

2236
01:38:29.210 --> 01:38:34.210
<v Speaker 3>and it's a place of unbelievable possibility and potential catastrophe and I</v>

2237
01:38:35.191 --> 01:38:38.960
<v Speaker 3>think what we want to ride this through property and how do we do it,</v>

2238
01:38:39.010 --> 01:38:39.700
<v Speaker 3>what we don't know,</v>

2239
01:38:39.700 --> 01:38:43.590
<v Speaker 3>because there's going to be a lot of unknowns that come along with it and so</v>

2240
01:38:43.650 --> 01:38:44.700
<v Speaker 3>what are we gonna do about that?</v>

2241
01:38:44.701 --> 01:38:48.120
<v Speaker 3>Since we don't know what to do about what's unreal with and that's what that is.</v>

2242
01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:51.630
<v Speaker 3>We want to build ourselves as individuals and to people who are capable of</v>

2243
01:38:51.631 --> 01:38:53.910
<v Speaker 3>dealing with the unknown as it manifests itself,</v>

2244
01:38:54.710 --> 01:38:59.710
<v Speaker 3>and that's for life is about the book I wrote before which is coming out in</v>

2245
01:39:00.061 --> 01:39:01.330
<v Speaker 3>audio version on the twelfth.</v>

2246
01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:02.913
<v Speaker 2>It's</v>

2247
01:39:07.420 --> 01:39:08.420
<v Speaker 2>totalitarianism,</v>

2248
01:39:09.730 --> 01:39:11.200
<v Speaker 3>malevolence of evil in the world.</v>

2249
01:39:11.201 --> 01:39:14.530
<v Speaker 3>And my conclusion was get your act together.</v>

2250
01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:16.140
<v Speaker 3>Fundamentally,</v>

2251
01:39:16.140 --> 01:39:19.320
<v Speaker 3>it's like there's way more to you than you think for good or evil,</v>

2252
01:39:19.450 --> 01:39:23.430
<v Speaker 3>way more had you ever forced to be contended with and in some real sense of</v>

2253
01:39:23.431 --> 01:39:28.270
<v Speaker 3>you're at the center of the world and that the dance the world on your shoulders</v>

2254
01:39:28.570 --> 01:39:32.800
<v Speaker 3>and it's determined by the choices that you make and that's true for all of us</v>

2255
01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:36.310
<v Speaker 3>and that's why we have intrinsic value and that's where the legal system</v>

2256
01:39:36.700 --> 01:39:41.560
<v Speaker 3>recognizes that and I believe it's as true as if anything can be true and I do</v>

2257
01:39:41.561 --> 01:39:44.530
<v Speaker 3>think it would be a good idea if we could consciously realize that.</v>

2258
01:39:44.531 --> 01:39:47.890
<v Speaker 3>I think we're at a point where we could normally have these stories,</v>

2259
01:39:48.070 --> 01:39:52.600
<v Speaker 3>but we can understand what it would mean in transformation in consciousness in</v>

2260
01:39:52.601 --> 01:39:53.350
<v Speaker 3>some sense,</v>

2261
01:39:53.350 --> 01:39:57.730
<v Speaker 3>and it kind of maturation that in some sense it hasn't been possible before now</v>

2262
01:39:58.210 --> 01:40:02.610
<v Speaker 3>and so my hope for the best thing that you could possibly hope for it because</v>

2263
01:40:02.611 --> 01:40:03.444
<v Speaker 3>why the hell no,</v>

2264
01:40:03.710 --> 01:40:06.390
<v Speaker 3>and so that's the most thing that I could possibly hope for it.</v>

2265
01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:08.370
<v Speaker 3>I think that we're capable of doing it.</v>

2266
01:40:08.371 --> 01:40:13.371
<v Speaker 3>I truly do believe that and so that's all I have to say about that.</v>

2267
01:40:54.830 --> 01:40:57.730
<v Speaker 4>That's all I to say about</v>

2268
01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:03.700
<v Speaker 4>talk literally for the first hour and a half and when he said I'm going to end</v>

2269
01:41:03.701 --> 01:41:04.990
<v Speaker 4>with this and the entire room,</v>

2270
01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:10.420
<v Speaker 4>I didn't really think about what's going on in your guys.</v>

2271
01:41:10.421 --> 01:41:15.190
<v Speaker 4>Thinking about what you just heard here for the last two hours to thinking about</v>

2272
01:41:15.191 --> 01:41:15.701
<v Speaker 4>what you heard,</v>

2273
01:41:15.701 --> 01:41:19.030
<v Speaker 4>if anything about what was on CNN for the last two hours</v>

2274
01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:24.950
<v Speaker 4>talking about porn star.</v>

2275
01:41:24.970 --> 01:41:25.803
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2276
01:41:26.620 --> 01:41:27.820
<v Speaker 4>The point is we're waiting.</v>

2277
01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:29.020
<v Speaker 4>We're finally waiting.</v>

2278
01:41:29.021 --> 01:41:29.351
<v Speaker 4>Guys.</v>

2279
01:41:29.351 --> 01:41:30.450
<v Speaker 4>I hope you could feel it</v>

2280
01:41:36.070 --> 01:41:36.740
<v Speaker 4>happening.</v>

2281
01:41:36.740 --> 01:41:40.510
<v Speaker 4>All Jordan usually just takes a moment to just create that as neck.</v>

2282
01:41:40.511 --> 01:41:41.980
<v Speaker 4>I think he's probably ready.</v>

2283
01:41:42.310 --> 01:41:43.870
<v Speaker 4>We took questions on slido.</v>

2284
01:41:43.871 --> 01:41:45.730
<v Speaker 4>You guys send us the questions ready?</v>

2285
01:41:45.790 --> 01:41:47.650
<v Speaker 4>We do this totally uncensored,</v>

2286
01:41:47.710 --> 01:41:49.270
<v Speaker 4>so give him around her claws.</v>

2287
01:41:49.300 --> 01:41:50.133
<v Speaker 4>Jordan.</v>

2288
01:41:59.420 --> 01:42:00.253
<v Speaker 4>Today.</v>

2289
01:42:02.010 --> 01:42:03.980
<v Speaker 4>We've been doing it the other way and</v>

2290
01:42:05.850 --> 01:42:06.720
<v Speaker 4>see what happened.</v>

2291
01:42:11.990 --> 01:42:16.150
<v Speaker 4>You didn't go into beyond the root risks is side of the state.</v>

2292
01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:19.760
<v Speaker 4>We got a ton of great stuff here.</v>

2293
01:42:19.761 --> 01:42:20.020
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

2294
01:42:20.020 --> 01:42:21.270
<v Speaker 4>this is completely uncensored.</v>

2295
01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:23.410
<v Speaker 4>People are all asking about you guys tonight.</v>

2296
01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:26.500
<v Speaker 4>I will start with clearly what seems to be the most important one.</v>

2297
01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:29.490
<v Speaker 4>When will you be doing a new web with Kanye West?</v>

2298
01:42:33.810 --> 01:42:35.820
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you want to hear her.</v>

2299
01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:36.753
<v Speaker 4>Say,</v>

2300
01:42:39.020 --> 01:42:39.620
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2301
01:42:39.620 --> 01:42:42.010
<v Speaker 4>anyone who's ever heard me say finger,</v>

2302
01:42:45.900 --> 01:42:48.130
<v Speaker 4>I think I kind of wanted to have.</v>

2303
01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:55.870
<v Speaker 4>What do you think about understanding thrown in bonus one for me here.</v>

2304
01:42:55.871 --> 01:42:57.170
<v Speaker 4>What do you think about this feeling?</v>

2305
01:42:57.490 --> 01:42:58.211
<v Speaker 4>Feeling in the room,</v>

2306
01:42:58.211 --> 01:42:58.871
<v Speaker 4>like the truth,</v>

2307
01:42:58.871 --> 01:43:01.180
<v Speaker 4>the joy that's in this room right here about this.</v>

2308
01:43:01.181 --> 01:43:01.790
<v Speaker 4>What do you.</v>

2309
01:43:01.790 --> 01:43:03.170
<v Speaker 4>What do you love about</v>

2310
01:43:12.840 --> 01:43:14.160
<v Speaker 4>this whole intellectual start?</v>

2311
01:43:14.180 --> 01:43:19.180
<v Speaker 4>Web intake is completely surreal moment and there's this group of people who</v>

2312
01:43:23.050 --> 01:43:25.420
<v Speaker 4>have risen to a kind of strange,</v>

2313
01:43:26.290 --> 01:43:31.290
<v Speaker 4>somewhat countercultural position of prominence and there isn't anything about</v>

2314
01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:35.740
<v Speaker 4>the same except they're all,</v>

2315
01:43:36.740 --> 01:43:36.960
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

2316
01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:38.330
<v Speaker 4>That's about as part of the job.</v>

2317
01:43:40.750 --> 01:43:45.750
<v Speaker 4>Thinking about what might unite them to the degree that that's a reasonable</v>

2318
01:43:45.911 --> 01:43:50.620
<v Speaker 4>proposition and I think what it is is that they actually have respect for their</v>

2319
01:43:50.621 --> 01:43:52.520
<v Speaker 4>audience and</v>

2320
01:43:55.180 --> 01:43:58.650
<v Speaker 4>my sense is people.</v>

2321
01:43:59.270 --> 01:44:02.050
<v Speaker 4>I never lecture down.</v>

2322
01:44:02.810 --> 01:44:04.370
<v Speaker 4>I'm not trying to make things simpler.</v>

2323
01:44:04.371 --> 01:44:05.250
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to make them as,</v>

2324
01:44:05.900 --> 01:44:08.620
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to communicate them as clearly as I possibly count,</v>

2325
01:44:08.870 --> 01:44:12.950
<v Speaker 4>but I'm making the assumption that everyone is on board and we're going in the</v>

2326
01:44:12.951 --> 01:44:13.820
<v Speaker 4>same direction,</v>

2327
01:44:14.080 --> 01:44:14.913
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2328
01:44:15.030 --> 01:44:18.290
<v Speaker 4>and I think that that's a characteristic and everyone in that group,</v>

2329
01:44:18.650 --> 01:44:19.483
<v Speaker 4>like if you look out,</v>

2330
01:44:20.030 --> 01:44:20.180
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2331
01:44:20.180 --> 01:44:20.781
<v Speaker 4>Shapiro's,</v>

2332
01:44:20.781 --> 01:44:21.530
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

2333
01:44:21.530 --> 01:44:24.900
<v Speaker 4>These are people in very different political perspectives like Ben Shapiro and</v>

2334
01:44:25.070 --> 01:44:26.180
<v Speaker 4>one on for example.</v>

2335
01:44:26.181 --> 01:44:26.900
<v Speaker 4>It's like they're,</v>

2336
01:44:26.900 --> 01:44:30.410
<v Speaker 4>they're pretty much on Daniel for political distribution,</v>

2337
01:44:30.680 --> 01:44:31.440
<v Speaker 4>but they,</v>

2338
01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:35.690
<v Speaker 4>they both assumed that the people that are talking to have enough sense to know</v>

2339
01:44:35.691 --> 01:44:39.980
<v Speaker 4>just that the people that are talking to are intelligent and awkward.</v>

2340
01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:44.030
<v Speaker 4>And so when I come in and talk to a group like this,</v>

2341
01:44:44.031 --> 01:44:46.210
<v Speaker 4>I think are,</v>

2342
01:44:49.100 --> 01:44:49.933
<v Speaker 4>I'm</v>

2343
01:44:51.290 --> 01:44:54.590
<v Speaker 4>assuming that the best way mean is talking to the best in you.</v>

2344
01:44:55.100 --> 01:44:56.120
<v Speaker 4>And that would be great.</v>

2345
01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:02.000
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

2346
01:45:04.070 --> 01:45:04.903
<v Speaker 4>I like this one.</v>

2347
01:45:04.940 --> 01:45:07.250
<v Speaker 4>If you were to write a work of fiction,</v>

2348
01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:08.480
<v Speaker 4>what would it be about?</v>

2349
01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:10.551
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2350
01:45:10.551 --> 01:45:12.010
<v Speaker 4>I started reading fiction.</v>

2351
01:45:13.120 --> 01:45:13.761
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't work,</v>

2352
01:45:13.761 --> 01:45:14.810
<v Speaker 4>you'd expect.</v>

2353
01:45:15.070 --> 01:45:19.110
<v Speaker 4>And so really the brutal satirical murder registering</v>

2354
01:45:20.780 --> 01:45:22.250
<v Speaker 4>as funny.</v>

2355
01:45:22.251 --> 01:45:23.670
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty dark</v>

2356
01:45:25.370 --> 01:45:26.600
<v Speaker 4>for shocking.</v>

2357
01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:27.633
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2358
01:45:28.550 --> 01:45:29.750
<v Speaker 4>I only wrote about,</v>

2359
01:45:29.780 --> 01:45:33.710
<v Speaker 4>I wrote about 25 pages of it and are already having fun with,</v>

2360
01:45:34.030 --> 01:45:37.730
<v Speaker 4>it was kind of a satirical new,</v>

2361
01:45:37.980 --> 01:45:39.950
<v Speaker 4>our effective novel.</v>

2362
01:45:39.951 --> 01:45:43.490
<v Speaker 4>And then I ran into my inlaws at Christmas one year.</v>

2363
01:45:46.030 --> 01:45:47.740
<v Speaker 4>I kind of forget what I'm like,</v>

2364
01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:48.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2365
01:45:48.050 --> 01:45:49.090
<v Speaker 4>because I've used it to me,</v>

2366
01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:57.140
<v Speaker 4>I read it to my father in law and my brother in law and my brother loves pretty</v>

2367
01:45:57.141 --> 01:46:00.940
<v Speaker 4>straight guy and the conservative guy and in this sort of western Alberta,</v>

2368
01:46:00.950 --> 01:46:02.330
<v Speaker 4>Texas type tradition,</v>

2369
01:46:02.331 --> 01:46:03.164
<v Speaker 4>and Ooh,</v>

2370
01:46:03.950 --> 01:46:07.460
<v Speaker 4>it's a brutally satirical piece.</v>

2371
01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:08.750
<v Speaker 4>And I read it in like,</v>

2372
01:46:09.170 --> 01:46:11.610
<v Speaker 4>all that happened was that there was a lot of silence.</v>

2373
01:46:13.110 --> 01:46:13.340
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2374
01:46:13.340 --> 01:46:15.800
<v Speaker 4>so I think that's what happened.</v>

2375
01:46:15.860 --> 01:46:17.060
<v Speaker 4>If I wrote a piece of fiction,</v>

2376
01:46:17.061 --> 01:46:18.490
<v Speaker 4>I think that that's what's already happened.</v>

2377
01:46:18.850 --> 01:46:21.170
<v Speaker 4>So I don't know if it's a good idea,</v>

2378
01:46:21.171 --> 01:46:21.951
<v Speaker 4>but you never know.</v>

2379
01:46:21.951 --> 01:46:23.110
<v Speaker 4>I might finish it sometime.</v>

2380
01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:24.343
<v Speaker 4>I did enjoy</v>

2381
01:46:28.770 --> 01:46:32.300
<v Speaker 4>this theme has been sort of an ongoing one that had all the shows that you</v>

2382
01:46:32.310 --> 01:46:37.310
<v Speaker 4>foresee a way for the Cultural Marxists and the length is to be defeated in our</v>

2383
01:46:37.461 --> 01:46:40.040
<v Speaker 4>culture without violence.</v>

2384
01:46:41.540 --> 01:46:41.661
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2385
01:46:41.661 --> 01:46:43.520
<v Speaker 4>hopefully not precisely defeated.</v>

2386
01:46:43.521 --> 01:46:45.170
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's the right terminology.</v>

2387
01:46:45.860 --> 01:46:47.050
<v Speaker 4>I think that the,</v>

2388
01:46:47.080 --> 01:46:50.040
<v Speaker 4>I think the person who tells the best story wins.</v>

2389
01:46:51.150 --> 01:46:52.560
<v Speaker 4>So that's the way forward is.</v>

2390
01:46:55.690 --> 01:46:57.360
<v Speaker 4>When I</v>

2391
01:46:58.860 --> 01:47:01.110
<v Speaker 4>went on Bill Maher while back,</v>

2392
01:47:01.770 --> 01:47:04.020
<v Speaker 4>it was interesting because,</v>

2393
01:47:04.700 --> 01:47:06.550
<v Speaker 4>well I had a conversation with,</v>

2394
01:47:06.630 --> 01:47:07.080
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>

2395
01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:07.601
<v Speaker 4>with Mara,</v>

2396
01:47:07.601 --> 01:47:11.190
<v Speaker 4>but my book and that went pretty well because he's kind of a free speech guy</v>

2397
01:47:11.191 --> 01:47:12.200
<v Speaker 4>because he's a comedian,</v>

2398
01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:14.030
<v Speaker 4>although he's pretty left as it is,</v>

2399
01:47:14.070 --> 01:47:15.330
<v Speaker 4>views and you know,</v>

2400
01:47:15.331 --> 01:47:19.030
<v Speaker 4>there's a bit of a tension there that he hasn't fully come to terms with.</v>

2401
01:47:19.150 --> 01:47:22.470
<v Speaker 4>Most people are full of contradict what people are full of contradictions,</v>

2402
01:47:22.770 --> 01:47:27.060
<v Speaker 4>but then at the end of the show they have this extra period that's only put on</v>

2403
01:47:27.061 --> 01:47:30.410
<v Speaker 4>Youtube and I was listening to the panel as you know,</v>

2404
01:47:30.660 --> 01:47:33.450
<v Speaker 4>thrash away trump and it's like that's amongst gay,</v>

2405
01:47:33.451 --> 01:47:33.721
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2406
01:47:33.721 --> 01:47:35.070
<v Speaker 4>like anybody can do that.</v>

2407
01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:38.550
<v Speaker 4>And so it's just not that interesting to listen to.</v>

2408
01:47:38.640 --> 01:47:42.280
<v Speaker 4>It's not interesting to listen to celebrities actually have trump because there</v>

2409
01:47:42.281 --> 01:47:44.910
<v Speaker 4>are no more interesting than hearing anyone else do that as far as I'm</v>

2410
01:47:44.911 --> 01:47:45.744
<v Speaker 4>concerned.</v>

2411
01:47:46.370 --> 01:47:48.420
<v Speaker 4>So it's like shooting fish in a barrel.</v>

2412
01:47:49.860 --> 01:47:52.460
<v Speaker 4>Obviously he has some flaws,</v>

2413
01:47:52.470 --> 01:47:53.303
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2414
01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:55.410
<v Speaker 4>Pointing them out.</v>

2415
01:47:55.650 --> 01:47:57.150
<v Speaker 4>It's not an act of brilliance.</v>

2416
01:47:57.440 --> 01:47:58.273
<v Speaker 4>Seriously.</v>

2417
01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:05.850
<v Speaker 4>Definitely doesn't mean you shouldn't criticize your political leaders because</v>

2418
01:48:05.851 --> 01:48:06.571
<v Speaker 4>of course you should,</v>

2419
01:48:06.571 --> 01:48:07.660
<v Speaker 4>but what are.</v>

2420
01:48:08.520 --> 01:48:13.520
<v Speaker 4>There was a vitriolic undertone to the commentary that went beyond trump and I</v>

2421
01:48:13.981 --> 01:48:14.750
<v Speaker 4>kept thinking,</v>

2422
01:48:14.750 --> 01:48:14.940
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2423
01:48:14.940 --> 01:48:15.721
<v Speaker 4>I'm Canadian,</v>

2424
01:48:15.721 --> 01:48:19.110
<v Speaker 4>so I was kind of looking at this very sympathetic to the US.</v>

2425
01:48:19.111 --> 01:48:21.270
<v Speaker 4>I've lived here for seven years and I really liked the US.</v>

2426
01:48:21.330 --> 01:48:22.680
<v Speaker 4>I think it's an amazing place.</v>

2427
01:48:23.550 --> 01:48:24.383
<v Speaker 4>So remarkable.</v>

2428
01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:25.430
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

2429
01:48:29.480 --> 01:48:29.971
<v Speaker 4>was thinking,</v>

2430
01:48:29.971 --> 01:48:30.804
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2431
01:48:31.170 --> 01:48:36.170
<v Speaker 4>these idiot trump supporters that you guys are on about like that's 50 percent</v>

2432
01:48:36.271 --> 01:48:37.350
<v Speaker 4>of your nation.</v>

2433
01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:40.890
<v Speaker 4>It's probably people in your own family.</v>

2434
01:48:40.891 --> 01:48:42.480
<v Speaker 4>It certainly people that you work with,</v>

2435
01:48:42.660 --> 01:48:44.220
<v Speaker 4>they're actually not all stupid.</v>

2436
01:48:44.230 --> 01:48:48.420
<v Speaker 4>The hardest that is to believe because 50 percent of the people aren't stupid.</v>

2437
01:48:48.540 --> 01:48:49.230
<v Speaker 4>Besides that,</v>

2438
01:48:49.230 --> 01:48:50.490
<v Speaker 4>for the last four elections,</v>

2439
01:48:50.491 --> 01:48:53.460
<v Speaker 4>50 percent of Americans and voted Republican,</v>

2440
01:48:53.490 --> 01:48:58.080
<v Speaker 4>but you guys are split exactly down the middle and so what are you going to do?</v>

2441
01:48:58.120 --> 01:48:59.490
<v Speaker 4>Defeat half your country?</v>

2442
01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:00.780
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>

2443
01:49:00.780 --> 01:49:03.390
<v Speaker 4>What the hell good is that you have to live with these people.</v>

2444
01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:05.520
<v Speaker 4>They're quite a lot like you.</v>

2445
01:49:05.521 --> 01:49:06.310
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

2446
01:49:06.310 --> 01:49:09.360
<v Speaker 4>they might be even beat you for that matter,</v>

2447
01:49:09.990 --> 01:49:12.750
<v Speaker 4>so then I think while it's with the radical left this too,</v>

2448
01:49:12.751 --> 01:49:17.751
<v Speaker 4>it's like it would be better to have them drop what they're doing and integrate</v>

2449
01:49:18.051 --> 01:49:20.070
<v Speaker 4>themselves back into it,</v>

2450
01:49:20.120 --> 01:49:25.120
<v Speaker 4>do the reasonable world and be guided in that process and I think the right way</v>

2451
01:49:25.441 --> 01:49:27.570
<v Speaker 4>to do that is to tell a more compelling story.</v>

2452
01:49:27.630 --> 01:49:31.770
<v Speaker 4>It's like forget about all that resentment and bitterness and oppression,</v>

2453
01:49:31.771 --> 01:49:34.870
<v Speaker 4>narrative and identity politics and racial divide and all of that,</v>

2454
01:49:34.871 --> 01:49:35.704
<v Speaker 4>and it's like,</v>

2455
01:49:35.790 --> 01:49:36.600
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2456
01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:37.740
<v Speaker 4>it's understandable.</v>

2457
01:49:37.770 --> 01:49:39.660
<v Speaker 4>There are people in the world.</v>

2458
01:49:39.720 --> 01:49:41.160
<v Speaker 4>We do have group identities.</v>

2459
01:49:41.161 --> 01:49:43.170
<v Speaker 4>Everything is divided up equally,</v>

2460
01:49:43.500 --> 01:49:44.333
<v Speaker 4>but that's.</v>

2461
01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:46.313
<v Speaker 4>That's just</v>

2462
01:49:47.900 --> 01:49:48.733
<v Speaker 4>no</v>

2463
01:49:52.830 --> 01:49:55.990
<v Speaker 4>from an identity politics perspective was so god damn dog.</v>

2464
01:49:55.991 --> 01:49:57.230
<v Speaker 4>I can hardly stand it.</v>

2465
01:50:01.660 --> 01:50:02.940
<v Speaker 4>I'm hoping it's a better story.</v>

2466
01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:04.960
<v Speaker 4>The story of the individual is a better story.</v>

2467
01:50:15.400 --> 01:50:18.280
<v Speaker 4>When were you running for prime minister of Canada</v>

2468
01:50:27.710 --> 01:50:28.543
<v Speaker 4>pipeline</v>

2469
01:50:40.620 --> 01:50:41.453
<v Speaker 4>because.</v>

2470
01:50:41.620 --> 01:50:46.000
<v Speaker 4>Because I don't think it's unreasonable to assume that you have a political</v>

2471
01:50:46.001 --> 01:50:48.250
<v Speaker 4>career in Canada if I chose to do that,</v>

2472
01:50:48.730 --> 01:50:51.130
<v Speaker 4>but this is pretty good.</v>

2473
01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:51.993
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2474
01:50:52.330 --> 01:50:57.040
<v Speaker 4>I am a psychologist and an educated and I am primarily concerned with the</v>

2475
01:50:57.041 --> 01:50:59.660
<v Speaker 4>individual and I don't think that I could do both of them.</v>

2476
01:50:59.830 --> 01:51:01.390
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's possible to do both.</v>

2477
01:51:01.720 --> 01:51:06.460
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking to a lot of politicians to Canada and in Australia and in the United</v>

2478
01:51:06.460 --> 01:51:10.360
<v Speaker 4>States about the idea of individual sovereignty and a both personal</v>

2479
01:51:10.361 --> 01:51:11.141
<v Speaker 4>responsibility,</v>

2480
01:51:11.141 --> 01:51:14.310
<v Speaker 4>especially for the more conservative types because they're starting to cotton</v>

2481
01:51:14.360 --> 01:51:16.360
<v Speaker 4>onto the fact that there's a market for that.</v>

2482
01:51:16.720 --> 01:51:17.230
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2483
01:51:17.230 --> 01:51:18.390
<v Speaker 4>for responsibilities,</v>

2484
01:51:18.400 --> 01:51:21.190
<v Speaker 4>but I think I'm far more effective doing what I'm doing now.</v>

2485
01:51:21.191 --> 01:51:24.670
<v Speaker 4>Then I wouldn't be if I made a lateral move into a political domain,</v>

2486
01:51:24.671 --> 01:51:25.504
<v Speaker 4>so I don't mind.</v>

2487
01:51:29.420 --> 01:51:32.740
<v Speaker 4>Thanks for the record.</v>

2488
01:51:32.741 --> 01:51:34.420
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty sure if the Trudeau can do it,</v>

2489
01:51:34.421 --> 01:51:35.254
<v Speaker 4>you can do it.</v>

2490
01:51:36.240 --> 01:51:39.370
<v Speaker 4>I think of that as a compliment,</v>

2491
01:51:39.440 --> 01:51:40.273
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

2492
01:51:42.760 --> 01:51:43.840
<v Speaker 4>I did not write this one,</v>

2493
01:51:43.841 --> 01:51:45.280
<v Speaker 4>but what did you think of Star Wars?</v>

2494
01:51:45.281 --> 01:51:46.150
<v Speaker 4>Episode eight</v>

2495
01:51:50.810 --> 01:51:51.643
<v Speaker 4>show that.</v>

2496
01:51:55.290 --> 01:51:59.590
<v Speaker 4>The problem was that I have with the Star Wars Program says this shows is that</v>

2497
01:51:59.620 --> 01:52:01.750
<v Speaker 4>every one of them is the same movie.</v>

2498
01:52:05.430 --> 01:52:10.120
<v Speaker 4>It's well known that that Tom who wrote star wars,</v>

2499
01:52:10.720 --> 01:52:12.280
<v Speaker 4>George Lucas,</v>

2500
01:52:12.550 --> 01:52:14.440
<v Speaker 4>Lucas consultant with Joseph Campbell,</v>

2501
01:52:15.700 --> 01:52:16.481
<v Speaker 4>Joseph Campbell,</v>

2502
01:52:16.481 --> 01:52:18.280
<v Speaker 4>was a student of cardio exam.</v>

2503
01:52:18.520 --> 01:52:21.100
<v Speaker 4>There's clearly continual,</v>

2504
01:52:21.700 --> 01:52:26.680
<v Speaker 4>partially conscious utilization of mythological architects in movies like Star</v>

2505
01:52:26.680 --> 01:52:26.830
<v Speaker 4>Wars,</v>

2506
01:52:26.830 --> 01:52:28.970
<v Speaker 4>all the big screen in action adventure movies,</v>

2507
01:52:28.971 --> 01:52:31.610
<v Speaker 4>so that sort of having this logical substrate and you know,</v>

2508
01:52:32.880 --> 01:52:37.880
<v Speaker 4>I've always fail because a story to be great has to be a great story and if it's</v>

2509
01:52:38.231 --> 01:52:40.480
<v Speaker 4>a great story then it's an archetypal story.</v>

2510
01:52:40.510 --> 01:52:41.410
<v Speaker 4>There's no way around it.</v>

2511
01:52:41.750 --> 01:52:46.750
<v Speaker 4>What makes it distort so more power to the horn with types for retailing.</v>

2512
01:52:46.790 --> 01:52:48.190
<v Speaker 4>The great stories of.</v>

2513
01:52:48.200 --> 01:52:50.450
<v Speaker 4>I've noticed particularly a fan of star wars.</v>

2514
01:52:50.570 --> 01:52:51.530
<v Speaker 4>Having said that,</v>

2515
01:52:54.750 --> 01:52:58.040
<v Speaker 4>I mean I can't really argue with them</v>

2516
01:53:00.590 --> 01:53:04.370
<v Speaker 4>given the tremendous amount of effort that goes into raising a child.</v>

2517
01:53:04.820 --> 01:53:07.970
<v Speaker 4>What do you think of the state and local parenting technique?</v>

2518
01:53:09.850 --> 01:53:12.440
<v Speaker 4>You mean winter people should stay at home with their children.</v>

2519
01:53:12.441 --> 01:53:13.610
<v Speaker 4>I guess that's the question.</v>

2520
01:53:14.770 --> 01:53:17.650
<v Speaker 4>That's a good thing you don't</v>

2521
01:53:20.130 --> 01:53:22.100
<v Speaker 4>think about having kids is that,</v>

2522
01:53:22.450 --> 01:53:22.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2523
01:53:22.730 --> 01:53:24.190
<v Speaker 4>let's say you got 90 years,</v>

2524
01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:26.990
<v Speaker 4>something like that and maybe having two kids,</v>

2525
01:53:27.740 --> 01:53:28.461
<v Speaker 4>maybe three,</v>

2526
01:53:28.461 --> 01:53:33.461
<v Speaker 4>but probably two is pretty much the average and so that means you have three to</v>

2527
01:53:34.731 --> 01:53:37.310
<v Speaker 4>six years of little kids are 48 years,</v>

2528
01:53:37.340 --> 01:53:38.270
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>

2529
01:53:39.890 --> 01:53:40.760
<v Speaker 4>So if you miss it,</v>

2530
01:53:41.450 --> 01:53:46.450
<v Speaker 4>you miss it and I would say don't miss it because anymore than you have to the</v>

2531
01:53:46.671 --> 01:53:47.001
<v Speaker 4>problem.</v>

2532
01:53:47.001 --> 01:53:49.190
<v Speaker 4>We have a little kid in about six months later you think,</v>

2533
01:53:49.191 --> 01:53:49.281
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2534
01:53:49.281 --> 01:53:53.830
<v Speaker 4>I've always had this little kid because he gave me kind of accustomed to it and</v>

2535
01:53:53.840 --> 01:53:56.540
<v Speaker 4>then I'm going to be living for very long and you don't live very long.</v>

2536
01:53:57.560 --> 01:53:58.460
<v Speaker 4>Time passes.</v>

2537
01:53:58.880 --> 01:53:59.631
<v Speaker 4>The older you get,</v>

2538
01:53:59.631 --> 01:54:04.631
<v Speaker 4>the faster and palaces and your life is not long and there isn't that much to</v>

2539
01:54:04.731 --> 01:54:08.650
<v Speaker 4>fill it with and one of the things to fill it with as little kids and you'll</v>

2540
01:54:15.860 --> 01:54:18.650
<v Speaker 4>see little kids who paid you for taking care of them.</v>

2541
01:54:19.100 --> 01:54:23.780
<v Speaker 4>They pay you by being happier than you exist than anyone will ever be again in</v>

2542
01:54:23.781 --> 01:54:24.620
<v Speaker 4>your life period.</v>

2543
01:54:28.430 --> 01:54:30.760
<v Speaker 4>And they pay you because they're ridiculous.</v>

2544
01:54:30.761 --> 01:54:33.320
<v Speaker 4>The comical and playful and funny.</v>

2545
01:54:33.560 --> 01:54:36.920
<v Speaker 4>There's like little kids are so damn funny and I can't figure that out.</v>

2546
01:54:36.921 --> 01:54:38.240
<v Speaker 4>They have a sense of humor right?</v>

2547
01:54:38.241 --> 01:54:39.320
<v Speaker 4>From like eight months.</v>

2548
01:54:39.630 --> 01:54:44.120
<v Speaker 4>You can play tricks on them and they laugh and I can't figure that out.</v>

2549
01:54:44.121 --> 01:54:48.230
<v Speaker 4>I can't figure out how they can be so damn sophisticated before they can even</v>

2550
01:54:48.231 --> 01:54:48.650
<v Speaker 4>talk.</v>

2551
01:54:48.650 --> 01:54:49.730
<v Speaker 4>They have a good sense of humor.</v>

2552
01:54:49.731 --> 01:54:51.350
<v Speaker 4>They can do little things,</v>

2553
01:54:51.351 --> 01:54:52.184
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2554
01:54:52.270 --> 01:54:54.190
<v Speaker 4>I'm catching onto your jokes and,</v>

2555
01:54:54.560 --> 01:54:55.940
<v Speaker 4>and you can play with them,</v>

2556
01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:57.770
<v Speaker 4>which is ridiculous.</v>

2557
01:54:58.310 --> 01:55:01.430
<v Speaker 4>It's something that fathers in particular do with their children,</v>

2558
01:55:01.431 --> 01:55:02.660
<v Speaker 4>especially rough and tumble play.</v>

2559
01:55:02.661 --> 01:55:04.790
<v Speaker 4>I just didn't talk about that.</v>

2560
01:55:04.791 --> 01:55:05.810
<v Speaker 4>It was quite a good talk.</v>

2561
01:55:05.811 --> 01:55:10.310
<v Speaker 4>I think it's about the importance of rough and tumble play and fathering.</v>

2562
01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:13.880
<v Speaker 4>And then the other thing that little kids do for you is,</v>

2563
01:55:13.940 --> 01:55:14.151
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2564
01:55:14.151 --> 01:55:16.370
<v Speaker 4>you get kind of jaded as you get older.</v>

2565
01:55:16.370 --> 01:55:19.040
<v Speaker 4>And the reason for that is you start seeing the world.</v>

2566
01:55:19.820 --> 01:55:24.320
<v Speaker 4>What you start saying is your memory of the world because that was years in the</v>

2567
01:55:24.321 --> 01:55:25.040
<v Speaker 4>world longer,</v>

2568
01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:25.431
<v Speaker 4>longer.</v>

2569
01:55:25.431 --> 01:55:27.800
<v Speaker 4>You build up representations of the world.</v>

2570
01:55:27.890 --> 01:55:29.240
<v Speaker 4>And then you look at the world,</v>

2571
01:55:29.241 --> 01:55:30.620
<v Speaker 4>but the whole world on the headset,</v>

2572
01:55:30.650 --> 01:55:33.230
<v Speaker 4>you what representation to use and it's so.</v>

2573
01:55:33.231 --> 01:55:36.980
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're just seeing icons of your imagination that that's technically</v>

2574
01:55:36.981 --> 01:55:40.850
<v Speaker 4>what happens and that's why things don't fill you with a sense of wonder</v>

2575
01:55:40.851 --> 01:55:45.851
<v Speaker 4>constantly and there are there ways of subverting that to the world reappears in</v>

2576
01:55:48.031 --> 01:55:49.280
<v Speaker 4>order to regional Gloria,</v>

2577
01:55:49.380 --> 01:55:51.510
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that psychedelics do for people,</v>

2578
01:55:51.840 --> 01:55:53.780
<v Speaker 4>but generally as you</v>

2579
01:55:57.410 --> 01:55:58.660
<v Speaker 4>renew their perceptions,</v>

2580
01:55:58.670 --> 01:55:59.130
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2581
01:55:59.130 --> 01:56:00.340
<v Speaker 4>And that can happen in radically,</v>

2582
01:56:00.390 --> 01:56:01.570
<v Speaker 4>that can happen to appointments,</v>

2583
01:56:01.590 --> 01:56:02.730
<v Speaker 4>absolutely overwhelming,</v>

2584
01:56:03.120 --> 01:56:07.270
<v Speaker 4>but little kids have that psychedelic property because when you're around the</v>

2585
01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:07.500
<v Speaker 4>point,</v>

2586
01:56:07.500 --> 01:56:12.500
<v Speaker 4>they're so completely blown away by everything that's happening that you can</v>

2587
01:56:13.531 --> 01:56:15.450
<v Speaker 4>look at the world through their eyes again.</v>

2588
01:56:15.450 --> 01:56:17.640
<v Speaker 4>And so that takes you out of your cynicism.</v>

2589
01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:19.410
<v Speaker 4>And that's also a really good thing.</v>

2590
01:56:19.411 --> 01:56:21.660
<v Speaker 4>So I would say it's not so much.</v>

2591
01:56:21.690 --> 01:56:21.820
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2592
01:56:21.820 --> 01:56:24.120
<v Speaker 4>you have a moral duty to stay home with your kids,</v>

2593
01:56:24.300 --> 01:56:25.140
<v Speaker 4>although you might.</v>

2594
01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:26.760
<v Speaker 4>That's not the point.</v>

2595
01:56:26.761 --> 01:56:27.594
<v Speaker 4>The point is,</v>

2596
01:56:27.780 --> 01:56:28.980
<v Speaker 4>what the hell do you have to do?</v>

2597
01:56:29.070 --> 01:56:30.390
<v Speaker 4>It's actually better than that.</v>

2598
01:56:31.100 --> 01:56:33.840
<v Speaker 4>You know when you think you're going to have to interrupt your career,</v>

2599
01:56:33.860 --> 01:56:34.140
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

2600
01:56:34.140 --> 01:56:35.310
<v Speaker 4>well first of all,</v>

2601
01:56:35.340 --> 01:56:37.630
<v Speaker 4>most of you don't have careers and</v>

2602
01:56:39.680 --> 01:56:42.530
<v Speaker 4>jobs and more power to you,</v>

2603
01:56:42.580 --> 01:56:44.180
<v Speaker 4>like jobs have to be done,</v>

2604
01:56:44.720 --> 01:56:45.350
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

2605
01:56:45.350 --> 01:56:47.310
<v Speaker 4>and then even if you do have your career,</v>

2606
01:56:47.370 --> 01:56:49.290
<v Speaker 4>and I know this from experience,</v>

2607
01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:54.420
<v Speaker 4>the probability that your career is more important than the time you spend with</v>

2608
01:56:54.421 --> 01:56:54.961
<v Speaker 4>your kids.</v>

2609
01:56:54.961 --> 01:56:55.530
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2610
01:56:55.530 --> 01:56:59.240
<v Speaker 4>it's faddish really small and especially because you can,</v>

2611
01:57:00.300 --> 01:57:01.260
<v Speaker 4>with difficulty,</v>

2612
01:57:01.261 --> 01:57:03.030
<v Speaker 4>you can have your cake and eat it too.</v>

2613
01:57:03.180 --> 01:57:05.970
<v Speaker 4>You can spend lots of time with your kids and you can have your career.</v>

2614
01:57:05.971 --> 01:57:07.040
<v Speaker 4>So I would say man,</v>

2615
01:57:07.350 --> 01:57:08.183
<v Speaker 4>don't mess it,</v>

2616
01:57:08.490 --> 01:57:13.110
<v Speaker 4>like don't mess with because there isn't that much in life that's real and</v>

2617
01:57:13.111 --> 01:57:13.741
<v Speaker 4>meaningful.</v>

2618
01:57:13.741 --> 01:57:15.930
<v Speaker 4>And that's one thing that definitely is.</v>

2619
01:57:18.940 --> 01:57:23.940
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

2620
01:57:24.610 --> 01:57:25.190
<v Speaker 4>Actually,</v>

2621
01:57:25.190 --> 01:57:26.640
<v Speaker 4>you referenced Psychedelics,</v>

2622
01:57:26.641 --> 01:57:28.210
<v Speaker 4>the way your kind of original</v>

2623
01:57:29.750 --> 01:57:31.150
<v Speaker 4>maybe the next door</v>

2624
01:57:33.900 --> 01:57:38.190
<v Speaker 4>when we wrap this tour and then we do like a trip with Peter said,</v>

2625
01:57:48.820 --> 01:57:49.653
<v Speaker 4>well</v>

2626
01:57:57.330 --> 01:58:00.720
<v Speaker 4>are you worried about becoming a bit of a cult of personality?</v>

2627
01:58:01.990 --> 01:58:02.220
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2628
01:58:02.220 --> 01:58:04.800
<v Speaker 4>anyone with any sense would worry about that.</v>

2629
01:58:05.340 --> 01:58:07.460
<v Speaker 4>I'm so,</v>

2630
01:58:11.760 --> 01:58:12.120
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2631
01:58:12.120 --> 01:58:12.953
<v Speaker 4>there's this,</v>

2632
01:58:13.870 --> 01:58:16.660
<v Speaker 4>there's this scene in the life of prior</v>

2633
01:58:18.960 --> 01:58:20.430
<v Speaker 4>window naked,</v>

2634
01:58:20.490 --> 01:58:21.570
<v Speaker 4>if I remember correctly,</v>

2635
01:58:22.100 --> 01:58:23.490
<v Speaker 4>and he's,</v>

2636
01:58:23.510 --> 01:58:27.560
<v Speaker 4>he's telling all these people who are carrying his shoes and his gardens around</v>

2637
01:58:28.110 --> 01:58:31.260
<v Speaker 4>that they're all individuals and they all chat.</v>

2638
01:58:31.261 --> 01:58:31.710
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

2639
01:58:31.710 --> 01:58:33.120
<v Speaker 4>we're all individuals</v>

2640
01:58:36.980 --> 01:58:39.730
<v Speaker 4>and it's a great movie and,</v>

2641
01:58:39.960 --> 01:58:41.940
<v Speaker 4>but I like worry about</v>

2642
01:58:42.760 --> 01:58:43.593
<v Speaker 3>because</v>

2643
01:58:45.070 --> 01:58:49.840
<v Speaker 3>I think that it encourages people to develop their individuality is actually not</v>

2644
01:58:49.841 --> 01:58:51.000
<v Speaker 3>the way that he started calling.</v>

2645
01:58:51.440 --> 01:58:52.273
<v Speaker 3>You don't mind.</v>

2646
01:59:01.540 --> 01:59:01.910
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2647
01:59:01.910 --> 01:59:02.271
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

2648
01:59:02.271 --> 01:59:03.104
<v Speaker 3>I'm serious.</v>

2649
01:59:06.320 --> 01:59:07.480
<v Speaker 3>What do you call it?</v>

2650
01:59:08.290 --> 01:59:12.410
<v Speaker 3>Tight definition and there's a bunch of things you have to do is you're going to</v>

2651
01:59:12.420 --> 01:59:16.610
<v Speaker 3>lead or do you have to separate people from their families and you have to tell</v>

2652
01:59:16.611 --> 01:59:20.090
<v Speaker 3>them that everyone outside in the cold is evil and you have to figure out a way</v>

2653
01:59:20.091 --> 01:59:23.050
<v Speaker 3>to extract their labor and resources from them.</v>

2654
01:59:23.570 --> 01:59:26.140
<v Speaker 3>You have to have a compound up in the hill.</v>

2655
01:59:26.980 --> 01:59:29.950
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to work to have a</v>

2656
01:59:32.610 --> 01:59:37.610
<v Speaker 3>well known and I'm not doing any of that old school genuinely.</v>

2657
01:59:39.010 --> 01:59:41.120
<v Speaker 3>I think as much as I can tell,</v>

2658
01:59:41.270 --> 01:59:42.260
<v Speaker 3>I have some experience.</v>

2659
01:59:42.760 --> 01:59:45.770
<v Speaker 3>I really am trying to encourage people to Africa.</v>

2660
01:59:46.490 --> 01:59:50.260
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to tell people how to live apart from the fact that patients leave</v>

2661
01:59:50.360 --> 01:59:53.480
<v Speaker 3>the lights that are the baskets that they can conceive,</v>

2662
01:59:54.120 --> 01:59:54.953
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2663
01:59:55.050 --> 01:59:58.600
<v Speaker 3>and I'm partly don't want to tell me a little device because I don't know.</v>

2664
01:59:58.700 --> 02:00:03.640
<v Speaker 3>One of the things I've learned is you don't want to tell people how to live</v>

2665
02:00:03.641 --> 02:00:05.900
<v Speaker 3>their lives because you don't want to steal their from.</v>

2666
02:00:06.290 --> 02:00:08.540
<v Speaker 3>That's the first thing for better or for worse,</v>

2667
02:00:08.541 --> 02:00:13.130
<v Speaker 3>and you don't suffer for their catastrophes no matter how well meaning advice</v>

2668
02:00:13.430 --> 02:00:14.730
<v Speaker 3>and also what do you know?</v>

2669
02:00:14.731 --> 02:00:18.470
<v Speaker 3>You don't know what's so good for this person to find out what's good for a</v>

2670
02:00:18.471 --> 02:00:18.771
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>

2671
02:00:18.771 --> 02:00:21.650
<v Speaker 3>You have to listen to them a lot because.</v>

2672
02:00:21.700 --> 02:00:26.390
<v Speaker 3>And they have to articulate your be to discover what their appropriate destiny</v>

2673
02:00:26.391 --> 02:00:27.224
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

2674
02:00:27.330 --> 02:00:28.650
<v Speaker 3>And that's what I.</v>

2675
02:00:29.110 --> 02:00:30.990
<v Speaker 3>that's what I'm hoping that people who did I,</v>

2676
02:00:31.150 --> 02:00:34.510
<v Speaker 3>I really hope that that's what everyone in this room was eating.</v>

2677
02:00:34.570 --> 02:00:36.480
<v Speaker 3>And I think perhaps that's where you're here.</v>

2678
02:00:36.481 --> 02:00:38.840
<v Speaker 3>Do you perhaps to be encouraged in that?</v>

2679
02:00:39.140 --> 02:00:43.010
<v Speaker 3>And I don't see anything about benefits apart from the fact that,</v>

2680
02:00:43.060 --> 02:00:43.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2681
02:00:43.300 --> 02:00:47.030
<v Speaker 3>I have a certain mode of public visibility.</v>

2682
02:00:48.250 --> 02:00:49.430
<v Speaker 3>I don't see that as cold,</v>

2683
02:00:49.450 --> 02:00:53.990
<v Speaker 3>like I just see it as a conversation about things that are important that we</v>

2684
02:00:53.991 --> 02:00:56.260
<v Speaker 3>should be attending to that we're all participating in.</v>

2685
02:00:56.300 --> 02:00:56.940
<v Speaker 3>That's how I look.</v>

2686
02:00:56.940 --> 02:00:57.773
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2687
02:01:03.940 --> 02:01:06.400
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to pass out the Koolaid like we did last night.</v>

2688
02:01:11.110 --> 02:01:12.100
<v Speaker 3>What do you do for fun?</v>

2689
02:01:12.101 --> 02:01:15.720
<v Speaker 3>Beers and hanging around with comedians.</v>

2690
02:01:18.220 --> 02:01:18.670
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

2691
02:01:18.670 --> 02:01:19.850
<v Speaker 3>I listen to music a lot.</v>

2692
02:01:20.350 --> 02:01:22.450
<v Speaker 3>I bought a car last year that I actually like.</v>

2693
02:01:23.450 --> 02:01:25.450
<v Speaker 3>It's an old Mercedes.</v>

2694
02:01:25.750 --> 02:01:27.190
<v Speaker 3>Well it's 2017,</v>

2695
02:01:27.220 --> 02:01:28.930
<v Speaker 3>which is normal enough to be cool,</v>

2696
02:01:28.931 --> 02:01:29.764
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2697
02:01:31.650 --> 02:01:35.140
<v Speaker 3>it's a convertible and I liked him to drive around in that and listen to really</v>

2698
02:01:35.141 --> 02:01:35.974
<v Speaker 3>loud music.</v>

2699
02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:41.953
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

2700
02:01:43.820 --> 02:01:48.820
<v Speaker 4>do hang around with my wife and my kids who are in their twenties now,</v>

2701
02:01:49.191 --> 02:01:50.660
<v Speaker 4>but we get along real well in there.</v>

2702
02:01:50.661 --> 02:01:51.530
<v Speaker 4>Pretty Damn funny.</v>

2703
02:01:52.010 --> 02:01:52.843
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2704
02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:54.500
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

2705
02:01:54.560 --> 02:01:58.400
<v Speaker 4>my son's a good musician and I like to listen to him sing and play the guitar.</v>

2706
02:01:59.210 --> 02:02:01.960
<v Speaker 4>My daughter had a baby and so you're like</v>

2707
02:02:07.340 --> 02:02:08.000
<v Speaker 4>12.</v>

2708
02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:11.870
<v Speaker 4>I read a lot about my daughter and she had a brutal adolescence.</v>

2709
02:02:11.871 --> 02:02:16.871
<v Speaker 4>It was absolutely unbelievably unbearable and no we didn't.</v>

2710
02:02:17.660 --> 02:02:21.150
<v Speaker 4>We didn't think she was really going to make it to her thirties and she's</v>

2711
02:02:21.170 --> 02:02:21.621
<v Speaker 4>better,</v>

2712
02:02:21.621 --> 02:02:22.454
<v Speaker 4>so</v>

2713
02:02:24.330 --> 02:02:29.330
<v Speaker 4>thank</v>

2714
02:02:32.810 --> 02:02:33.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2715
02:02:33.070 --> 02:02:34.210
<v Speaker 4>I kind of think this is.</v>

2716
02:02:34.340 --> 02:02:35.230
<v Speaker 4>There's something about this.</v>

2717
02:02:35.250 --> 02:02:36.083
<v Speaker 4>It's funny</v>

2718
02:02:38.390 --> 02:02:39.290
<v Speaker 4>because I've been feeling.</v>

2719
02:02:39.300 --> 02:02:42.550
<v Speaker 4>I've had some health problems and I seem to be recovering so accurate.</v>

2720
02:02:42.580 --> 02:02:45.110
<v Speaker 4>You have to go down before I come up.</v>

2721
02:02:45.170 --> 02:02:45.921
<v Speaker 4>Especially tonight.</v>

2722
02:02:45.921 --> 02:02:47.180
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what it is with you guys.</v>

2723
02:02:47.181 --> 02:02:48.500
<v Speaker 4>You are pretty damn positive.</v>

2724
02:02:51.260 --> 02:02:56.260
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

2725
02:03:00.090 --> 02:03:04.310
<v Speaker 4>The mood in this room is the most optimal of all the places that we've been.</v>

2726
02:03:04.580 --> 02:03:06.890
<v Speaker 4>Other places were quite positive for sure,</v>

2727
02:03:06.891 --> 02:03:10.520
<v Speaker 4>but there's something emotional level of enthusiasm and this crap that's higher</v>

2728
02:03:10.521 --> 02:03:11.180
<v Speaker 4>than usual.</v>
