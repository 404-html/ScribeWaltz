1
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.600
<v Speaker 1>So I want to tell you about a book</v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

2
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.240
<v Speaker 1>The book is called the Gulag</v>
<v Speaker 1>Archipelago.</v>

3
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.450
<v Speaker 1>You Ready?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The book is called the Gulag Archipelago</v>

4
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.690
<v Speaker 1>and it's by a Russian author.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Soviet arts are deemed Aleksandr</v>

5
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.590
<v Speaker 1>Solzhenitsyn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was in the Gulag archipelago</v>

6
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.280
<v Speaker 1>concentration camp system for a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>

7
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.110
<v Speaker 1>He had a very hard life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was on the</v>

8
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.240
<v Speaker 1>Russian front when the Germans invaded</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet Union in the early stages of</v>

9
00:00:45.481 --> 00:00:49.260
<v Speaker 1>World War II.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Hitler and Stalin had signed a</v>

10
00:00:49.261 --> 00:00:51.710
<v Speaker 1>nonaggression pact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

11
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.640
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

12
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.760
<v Speaker 1>And Hitler invaded the Soviet Union</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>

13
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.010
<v Speaker 1>And from what I've been able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>

14
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.810
<v Speaker 1>the Soviets had prepared an invasion</v>
<v Speaker 1>force for Europe at that point,</v>

15
00:01:05.811 --> 00:01:09.320
<v Speaker 1>but we're not concerned with having to</v>
<v Speaker 1>defend their territory.</v>

16
00:01:09.321 --> 00:01:12.440
<v Speaker 1>And so they were caught completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>unawares by Hitler's move.</v>

17
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.970
<v Speaker 1>And the conditions on the Russian front</v>
<v Speaker 1>were absolutely dreadful.</v>

18
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.830
<v Speaker 1>And soldier in Hudson was a soldier on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Russian front and</v>

19
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.740
<v Speaker 1>he wrote some letters to one of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>

20
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.910
<v Speaker 1>which were intercepted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>complaining about the lack of</v>

21
00:01:31.911 --> 00:01:36.911
<v Speaker 1>preparation and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and using bitter dark humor to describe</v>

22
00:01:37.821 --> 00:01:38.840
<v Speaker 1>the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

23
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.180
<v Speaker 1>the consequences of that was that he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>thrown into a work camp.</v>

24
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.750
<v Speaker 1>The Soviet system relied on work camps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so those were large labor camps of</v>

25
00:01:51.051 --> 00:01:54.980
<v Speaker 1>people who were essentially enslaved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of whom were worked to death,</v>

26
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.280
<v Speaker 1>often froze to death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>working in conditions that were so</v>

27
00:01:58.281 --> 00:02:00.620
<v Speaker 1>dreadful that they're virtually</v>
<v Speaker 1>unimaginable.</v>

28
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.960
<v Speaker 1>Solzhenitsyn spent a very large number</v>
<v Speaker 1>of years in these camps,</v>

29
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes in a more privileged camp</v>

30
00:02:08.961 --> 00:02:11.840
<v Speaker 1>because he was an educated man and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes in worst camps.</v>

31
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.230
<v Speaker 1>He also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

32
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.900
<v Speaker 1>developed cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

33
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.150
<v Speaker 1>later and wrote a book about that called</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cancer Ward,</v>

34
00:02:23.151 --> 00:02:25.600
<v Speaker 1>which is a brilliant book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

35
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.940
<v Speaker 1>so he had a very hard life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

36
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.130
<v Speaker 1>there's just no way around that to be on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the front and then to be in a</v>

37
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.440
<v Speaker 1>concentration camp and then to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer.</v>

38
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.060
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he wrote the Gulag archipelago.</v>

39
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.390
<v Speaker 1>He wrote a book called one day in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>life of Ivan Denisovich first that was</v>

40
00:02:44.391 --> 00:02:47.660
<v Speaker 1>published in the early 1960s when there</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a brief thaw.</v>

41
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.770
<v Speaker 1>Stalin was pretty much out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>picture by the end of the 1950s.</v>

42
00:02:51.771 --> 00:02:56.690
<v Speaker 1>There's some indication that he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>murdered by Khrushchev and a cruise ship</v>

43
00:02:56.691 --> 00:03:01.691
<v Speaker 1>became a premier of the Soviet Union</v>
<v Speaker 1>afters stolen and there's some</v>

44
00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:07.750
<v Speaker 1>indication perhaps that Stellan was</v>
<v Speaker 1>either murdered by Khrushchev and a set</v>

45
00:03:07.751 --> 00:03:12.751
<v Speaker 1>of his cronies or when he was very ill</v>
<v Speaker 1>just before he died was not helped at</v>

46
00:03:14.351 --> 00:03:18.850
<v Speaker 1>least by wasn't provided with any</v>
<v Speaker 1>medical attention because of the</v>

47
00:03:18.851 --> 00:03:20.590
<v Speaker 1>intervention of Khrushchev and his</v>
<v Speaker 1>cronies.</v>

48
00:03:20.591 --> 00:03:25.120
<v Speaker 1>Now there was some indication as well at</v>
<v Speaker 1>that point that Stalin who was an</v>

49
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.740
<v Speaker 1>absolute absolutely barbaric in every</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible way you could imagine was</v>

50
00:03:29.741 --> 00:03:34.741
<v Speaker 1>planning to start a third World War and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was certainly capable of doing such</v>

51
00:03:35.261 --> 00:03:40.261
<v Speaker 1>things because he had already imprisoned</v>
<v Speaker 1>or killed tens of millions of people.</v>

52
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.550
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>
<v Speaker 1>just after Stalin died,</v>

53
00:03:45.551 --> 00:03:48.460
<v Speaker 1>there was a bit of a thought in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Soviet Union with regards to internal</v>

54
00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:51.670
<v Speaker 1>repression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the early 1960s Solzhenitsyn</v>

55
00:03:51.671 --> 00:03:54.610
<v Speaker 1>published a book called one day in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>life of Ivan Denisovich,</v>

56
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.040
<v Speaker 1>which was a story about one day in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

57
00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:02.020
<v Speaker 1>His life really inside one of these so</v>
<v Speaker 1>called Gulag archipelago camps.</v>

58
00:04:02.021 --> 00:04:05.470
<v Speaker 1>Now he called it the Gulag archipelago</v>
<v Speaker 1>because in our compelling go is a chain</v>

59
00:04:05.471 --> 00:04:09.790
<v Speaker 1>of islands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so Solzhenitsyn likened the work</v>

60
00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:12.910
<v Speaker 1>camp system in the Soviet Union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was made up of isolated camps</v>

61
00:04:12.911 --> 00:04:17.740
<v Speaker 1>distributed across the entire state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He likened that to a series of islands</v>

62
00:04:17.741 --> 00:04:19.600
<v Speaker 1>and enhance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hence the metaphor.</v>

63
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.290
<v Speaker 1>And one day in the life of Ivan</v>
<v Speaker 1>Denisovich was one of the first</v>

64
00:04:23.291 --> 00:04:28.291
<v Speaker 1>publications released in the Soviet</v>
<v Speaker 1>Union that dared make public what had</v>

65
00:04:29.231 --> 00:04:32.230
<v Speaker 1>happened inside these camps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least initially.</v>

66
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.370
<v Speaker 1>Now that thought didn't last very long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that book had a tremendous effect.</v>

67
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.080
<v Speaker 1>It's a short book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's worth reading.</v>

68
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.590
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after that he spent,</v>

69
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.810
<v Speaker 1>he wrote a number of other books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are also great.</v>

70
00:04:43.811 --> 00:04:47.470
<v Speaker 1>He's a great literary figure in the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>category I would say as Tolstoy or</v>

71
00:04:47.471 --> 00:04:50.170
<v Speaker 1>Dostoevsky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like really saying something,</v>

72
00:04:50.171 --> 00:04:50.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

73
00:04:50.651 --> 00:04:53.050
<v Speaker 1>those two are perhaps the greatest</v>
<v Speaker 1>literary figures.</v>

74
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.780
<v Speaker 1>Whoever lived with the possible</v>
<v Speaker 1>exception of Shakespeare.</v>

75
00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.800
<v Speaker 1>He wrote this book called the Gulag</v>
<v Speaker 1>Archipelago,</v>

76
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.790
<v Speaker 1>which is published in three volumes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each of which has about 700 pages long.</v>

77
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first one details the origin of the</v>

78
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.470
<v Speaker 1>oppressive Soviet system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in part under Lenin.</v>

79
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.310
<v Speaker 1>And then it's full fledged</v>
<v Speaker 1>implementation understanding and the</v>

80
00:05:15.311 --> 00:05:18.340
<v Speaker 1>deaths of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while Solzhenitsyn estimated the deaths</v>

81
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.380
<v Speaker 1>in internal repression in the Soviet</v>
<v Speaker 1>Union at something approximating 60</v>

82
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.360
<v Speaker 1>million between 1919 in 1959.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that doesn't count the death toll in</v>

83
00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:29.740
<v Speaker 1>the second world war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

84
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.690
<v Speaker 1>Now people have disputed those figures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there certainly in the tens of</v>

85
00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.300
<v Speaker 1>millions in the low inbounds are</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably 20 million and the high end</v>

86
00:05:37.301 --> 00:05:38.830
<v Speaker 1>bounds or nearer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's old soldier in,</v>

87
00:05:38.831 --> 00:05:39.640
<v Speaker 1>it's an estimated.</v>

88
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:44.640
<v Speaker 1>He also estimated that the same kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>internal repression in Maoist China cost</v>

89
00:05:45.551 --> 00:05:49.270
<v Speaker 1>100 million lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can imagine that the genuine</v>

90
00:05:49.271 --> 00:05:51.400
<v Speaker 1>historical figures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

91
00:05:51.401 --> 00:05:54.790
<v Speaker 1>are subject to dispute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but somewhere between 50 and 100 million</v>

92
00:05:54.791 --> 00:05:56.830
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that's really</v>

93
00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.830
<v Speaker 1>surprising to me and that that I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>is absolutely reprehensible,</v>

94
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.030
<v Speaker 1>absolutely reprehensible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the fact that this is not widespread</v>

95
00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:07.250
<v Speaker 1>knowledge among students in the west,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any of this.</v>

96
00:06:07.251 --> 00:06:10.460
<v Speaker 1>And it's because your education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your historical education,</v>

97
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.650
<v Speaker 1>if you started to describe it as</v>
<v Speaker 1>appalling,</v>

98
00:06:12.651 --> 00:06:16.040
<v Speaker 1>you would barely scratch the surface.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These were the most important events of</v>

99
00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:20.510
<v Speaker 1>the 20th century and they're barely</v>
<v Speaker 1>covered at all in standard historical</v>

100
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.020
<v Speaker 1>curriculum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

101
00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:26.840
<v Speaker 1>something I would presume about World</v>
<v Speaker 1>War II and about the terrible situation</v>

102
00:06:26.841 --> 00:06:31.040
<v Speaker 1>in Nazi Germany and the death of 6</v>
<v Speaker 1>million Gypsies and Jews and homosexuals</v>

103
00:06:31.041 --> 00:06:33.890
<v Speaker 1>in the concentration camps in Nazi</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany.</v>

104
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:38.120
<v Speaker 1>But my experience with students has been</v>
<v Speaker 1>that none of them know anything about</v>

105
00:06:38.121 --> 00:06:42.260
<v Speaker 1>what happened as a consequence of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>repression of the radical left in the</v>

106
00:06:42.261 --> 00:06:43.040
<v Speaker 1>20th century.</v>

107
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:48.040
<v Speaker 1>And I believe the reason for that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the communist system had extensive</v>

108
00:06:49.431 --> 00:06:53.930
<v Speaker 1>networks of admirers in the west,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially among intellectuals and still</v>

109
00:06:53.931 --> 00:06:56.510
<v Speaker 1>in fact does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also equally reprehensible.</v>

110
00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I believe the,</v>

111
00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:03.770
<v Speaker 1>one of the consequences of that is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>this element of history has been under,</v>

112
00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>under,</v>

113
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:11.030
<v Speaker 1>what would you say under examined and</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly very little attention has been</v>

114
00:07:11.031 --> 00:07:13.460
<v Speaker 1>brought to it in the public school</v>
<v Speaker 1>curricula.</v>

115
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:15.710
<v Speaker 1>And there's absolutely no excuse for</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

116
00:07:15.711 --> 00:07:18.380
<v Speaker 1>It was the worst thing that happened in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 20th century.</v>

117
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:21.260
<v Speaker 1>And that's really saying something</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the 20th century was about as</v>

118
00:07:21.261 --> 00:07:23.390
<v Speaker 1>bad as it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

119
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.850
<v Speaker 1>and the fact that these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these massive,</v>

120
00:07:25.851 --> 00:07:30.560
<v Speaker 1>these deaths on massive scale occurred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the fact that we don't know that</v>

121
00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:32.420
<v Speaker 1>deep inside our bones is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

122
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:36.110
<v Speaker 1>is a testament to the absolute rot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the education system.</v>
