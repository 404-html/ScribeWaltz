1
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.971
<v Speaker 1>Cause you think,</v>

2
00:00:05.971 --> 00:00:06.430
<v Speaker 1>Lord,</v>

3
00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:07.890
<v Speaker 1>I thought appears in your hand.</v>

4
00:00:07.891 --> 00:00:08.161
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

5
00:00:08.161 --> 00:00:09.420
<v Speaker 1>That's obvious Pedang.</v>

6
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:09.901
<v Speaker 1>It's it.</v>

7
00:00:09.901 --> 00:00:11.340
<v Speaker 1>It's nothing you ever ask about.</v>

8
00:00:11.341 --> 00:00:12.960
<v Speaker 1>But what the hell does that mean?</v>

9
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.000
<v Speaker 1>I thought appears in your hand.</v>

10
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.610
<v Speaker 1>What kind of ridiculous explanation is that?</v>

11
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:18.743
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

12
00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.450
<v Speaker 1>it just doesn't help with anything.</v>

13
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.040
<v Speaker 1>Where does it come from?</v>

14
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.401
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

15
00:00:23.401 --> 00:00:23.880
<v Speaker 1>nowhere.</v>

16
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.040
<v Speaker 1>It just appears in my head.</v>

17
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:26.581
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

18
00:00:26.581 --> 00:00:29.820
<v Speaker 1>well that's not a very sophisticated explanation as it turns out,</v>

19
00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:30.540
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

20
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.880
<v Speaker 1>And so you might think that those thoughts,</v>

21
00:00:32.881 --> 00:00:33.870
<v Speaker 1>thoughts that you think,</v>

22
00:00:33.871 --> 00:00:33.991
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

23
00:00:33.991 --> 00:00:35.210
<v Speaker 1>where do they come from old?</v>

24
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.870
<v Speaker 1>They're often someone else's thoughts,</v>

25
00:00:36.871 --> 00:00:37.111
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

26
00:00:37.111 --> 00:00:38.250
<v Speaker 1>Someone Long Dad,</v>

27
00:00:38.251 --> 00:00:39.150
<v Speaker 1>that might be part of it.</v>

28
00:00:39.151 --> 00:00:43.800
<v Speaker 1>Just like the words you use to think our utterances of people who've been long</v>

29
00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:44.634
<v Speaker 1>dead.</v>

30
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.060
<v Speaker 1>And so you're informed by the spirit of your ancestors.</v>

31
00:00:48.061 --> 00:00:49.440
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of looking at it.</v>

32
00:00:49.441 --> 00:00:50.610
<v Speaker 1>And your motivation,</v>

33
00:00:50.611 --> 00:00:51.900
<v Speaker 1>speak to your motion,</v>

34
00:00:51.901 --> 00:00:53.100
<v Speaker 1>speak to in your body,</v>

35
00:00:53.101 --> 00:00:53.940
<v Speaker 1>speaks to you.</v>

36
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.830
<v Speaker 1>And it all does all that,</v>

37
00:00:55.831 --> 00:00:57.750
<v Speaker 1>at least in part through the dream.</v>

38
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.310
<v Speaker 1>And the dream is the birthplace of the fully articulated idea.</v>

39
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.950
<v Speaker 1>They don't just come from nowhere.</v>

40
00:01:04.951 --> 00:01:06.030
<v Speaker 1>Fully fledged,</v>

41
00:01:06.031 --> 00:01:06.211
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

42
00:01:06.211 --> 00:01:07.230
<v Speaker 1>They have a development,</v>

43
00:01:07.231 --> 00:01:09.340
<v Speaker 1>Laura Jun and God only knows how,</v>

44
00:01:09.341 --> 00:01:09.960
<v Speaker 1>how long,</v>

45
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.610
<v Speaker 1>how lengthy that origin is.</v>

46
00:01:11.611 --> 00:01:13.230
<v Speaker 1>Even to say something like,</v>

47
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.580
<v Speaker 1>I am conscious,</v>

48
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:15.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.550
<v Speaker 1>that's taken PE chimpanzees,</v>

50
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.810
<v Speaker 1>don't say that.</v>

51
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.621
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

52
00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:23.370
<v Speaker 1>it's been 7 million years since we broke from chimpanzees.</v>

53
00:01:23.371 --> 00:01:25.380
<v Speaker 1>Something like that from the common ancestor.</v>

54
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.621
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

55
00:01:25.621 --> 00:01:27.570
<v Speaker 1>they have no articulated knowledge at all.</v>

56
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.740
<v Speaker 1>They have very little self representation in some sense and very little self</v>

57
00:01:31.741 --> 00:01:32.574
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

58
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.590
<v Speaker 1>And that's not the case with us at all.</v>

59
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.550
<v Speaker 1>And we had to painstakingly figure all of this out during that,</v>

60
00:01:38.551 --> 00:01:38.881
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

61
00:01:38.881 --> 00:01:40.620
<v Speaker 1>7 million year voyage.</v>

62
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.280
<v Speaker 1>And I think some of that's represented and and,</v>

63
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.360
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

64
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.420
<v Speaker 1>and captured in some sense in these ancient stories,</v>

65
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.850
<v Speaker 1>which I believe were part of,</v>

66
00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.040
<v Speaker 1>especially the oldest stories in genesis,</v>

67
00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:57.200
<v Speaker 1>which is the stories we're going to start with that they were at that,</v>

68
00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.860
<v Speaker 1>that some of the archaic nature of the human being is encapsulated in those</v>

69
00:02:01.861 --> 00:02:02.250
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>

70
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.083
<v Speaker 1>And it's very,</v>

71
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.700
<v Speaker 1>very instructive as far as I can tell.</v>

72
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.440
<v Speaker 1>I can give you just a quick example.</v>

73
00:02:07.441 --> 00:02:07.651
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

74
00:02:07.651 --> 00:02:09.480
<v Speaker 1>there's an idea of sacrifice in,</v>

75
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.500
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

76
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.860
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

77
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.910
<v Speaker 1>in the Old Testament,</v>

78
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.380
<v Speaker 1>and it's pretty barbaric.</v>

79
00:02:13.381 --> 00:02:13.621
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

80
00:02:13.621 --> 00:02:14.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

81
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.670
<v Speaker 1>the story of Abraham and Isaac,</v>

82
00:02:15.671 --> 00:02:18.300
<v Speaker 1>there's a good example of that because Abraham was called on to actually</v>

83
00:02:18.301 --> 00:02:19.530
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice his own son,</v>

84
00:02:19.531 --> 00:02:22.890
<v Speaker 1>which doesn't really seem like something that a reasonable God would ask you to</v>

85
00:02:22.891 --> 00:02:23.191
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

86
00:02:23.191 --> 00:02:23.461
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

87
00:02:23.461 --> 00:02:28.461
<v Speaker 1>And the God in the Old Testament is frequently cruel and arbitrary and demanding</v>

88
00:02:28.501 --> 00:02:30.570
<v Speaker 1>and paradoxical and which,</v>

89
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.870
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the things that really gives the book life because it wasn't</v>

90
00:02:33.871 --> 00:02:35.490
<v Speaker 1>edited by a committee,</v>

91
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:36.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

92
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.770
<v Speaker 1>a committee that was concerned with,</v>

93
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:38.280
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

94
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

95
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.020
<v Speaker 1>Nardo offending anyone,</v>

96
00:02:40.021 --> 00:02:40.830
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
