1
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.410
<v Speaker 1>So wouldn't it be good if in every society where every organization,</v>

2
00:00:10.411 --> 00:00:13.020
<v Speaker 1>we had some people who specialized in,</v>

3
00:00:13.021 --> 00:00:13.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:14.521
<v Speaker 1>specialized,</v>

6
00:00:14.521 --> 00:00:15.354
<v Speaker 1>insane,</v>

7
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:15.751
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

8
00:00:15.751 --> 00:00:16.710
<v Speaker 1>what are the opportunities?</v>

9
00:00:16.711 --> 00:00:18.570
<v Speaker 1>And then we had other people as specialized in saying,</v>

10
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:18.931
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

11
00:00:18.931 --> 00:00:19.830
<v Speaker 1>but what are the risks?</v>

12
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.550
<v Speaker 1>And it just so happens that a lot of people have trouble doing all that in</v>

13
00:00:23.551 --> 00:00:24.384
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

14
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.840
<v Speaker 1>When we have systems that are well constituted with people who have different</v>

15
00:00:27.841 --> 00:00:29.670
<v Speaker 1>personalities and different motives and goals,</v>

16
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:30.770
<v Speaker 1>we actually can get better.</v>

17
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.640
<v Speaker 1>We can have a discussion between them.</v>

18
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.941
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

19
00:00:32.941 --> 00:00:36.780
<v Speaker 1>Well that's exactly why that it's for that precise reason that,</v>

20
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.660
<v Speaker 1>that I've been so interested in free speech as a,</v>

21
00:00:39.661 --> 00:00:40.380
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

22
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.790
<v Speaker 1>as a value because well,</v>

23
00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:43.140
<v Speaker 1>even on the economic front,</v>

24
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.870
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty obvious if you look at things economically,</v>

25
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.790
<v Speaker 1>that the entrepreneur types who start businesses are lumped in with the liberal</v>

26
00:00:50.791 --> 00:00:51.600
<v Speaker 1>creative types.</v>

27
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.670
<v Speaker 1>We've done a lot of work on the prediction of entrepreneurial behavior and</v>

28
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.130
<v Speaker 1>ability and it's openness.</v>

29
00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.090
<v Speaker 1>That's the big predictor.</v>

30
00:00:57.091 --> 00:00:57.921
<v Speaker 1>It's not the only one.</v>

31
00:00:57.921 --> 00:00:59.670
<v Speaker 1>It's openness an Iq fundamentally.</v>

32
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.790
<v Speaker 1>But for managerial and administrative expertise,</v>

33
00:01:02.791 --> 00:01:03.120
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

34
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.360
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

35
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.310
<v Speaker 1>it's Iq and conscientiousness.</v>

36
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.460
<v Speaker 1>So the liberals start businesses and,</v>

37
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:07.890
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

38
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.320
<v Speaker 1>but they can't run them because they're there,</v>

39
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.800
<v Speaker 1>their interests flipped and they don't have the organizational ability and the</v>

40
00:01:13.801 --> 00:01:14.820
<v Speaker 1>conservatives can run them,</v>

41
00:01:14.821 --> 00:01:17.280
<v Speaker 1>but they can't continue to transform and expand the,</v>

42
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.720
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

43
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.030
<v Speaker 1>It Yin and Yang.</v>

44
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.870
<v Speaker 1>Yin and Yang.</v>

45
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:20.703
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

46
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:21.710
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

47
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.420
<v Speaker 1>so one more thing about what happened in Nazi Germany that it's very relevant</v>

48
00:01:26.421 --> 00:01:27.550
<v Speaker 1>and interesting because it's,</v>

49
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.690
<v Speaker 1>it's useful to get these motives right.</v>

50
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:30.590
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

51
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.101
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

52
00:01:31.101 --> 00:01:31.430
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

53
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:32.900
<v Speaker 1>if something disgusts you,</v>

54
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:33.680
<v Speaker 1>if something,</v>

55
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.670
<v Speaker 1>if you're afraid of something,</v>

56
00:01:34.671 --> 00:01:36.290
<v Speaker 1>then you run away from it or you freeze.</v>

57
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.140
<v Speaker 1>But if something disgusts you,</v>

58
00:01:38.141 --> 00:01:40.310
<v Speaker 1>you try to burn it or die or kill it.</v>

59
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.701
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

60
00:01:40.701 --> 00:01:42.590
<v Speaker 1>You try to get rid of or expel it.</v>

61
00:01:42.591 --> 00:01:42.861
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

62
00:01:42.861 --> 00:01:43.530
<v Speaker 1>that's right though.</v>

63
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.890
<v Speaker 1>You want to get it away and destroy it.</v>

64
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.190
<v Speaker 1>So when Hitler came to power,</v>

65
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.770
<v Speaker 1>he put in above a bunch of public health schemes.</v>

66
00:01:51.771 --> 00:01:52.100
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

67
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.280
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

68
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.100
<v Speaker 1>he had vans that went around and screen people for tuberculosis.</v>

69
00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.310
<v Speaker 1>Then he went on a factory cleanliness,</v>

70
00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

71
00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.923
<v Speaker 1>campaign.</v>

72
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.740
<v Speaker 1>So the factories were supposed to be tidy it up and he washed,</v>

73
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.120
<v Speaker 1>he made about four times a day.</v>

74
00:02:05.121 --> 00:02:05.700
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

75
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.670
<v Speaker 1>it's also a great worship or of willpower,</v>

76
00:02:07.671 --> 00:02:11.420
<v Speaker 1>which is associated with orderliness and seems maybe to be associated with</v>

77
00:02:11.421 --> 00:02:11.871
<v Speaker 1>disgust,</v>

78
00:02:11.871 --> 00:02:14.240
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity in some way that isn't yet understood.</v>

79
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

80
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

81
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.890
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

82
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:16.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

83
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand that connection either.</v>

84
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.670
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>

85
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.260
<v Speaker 1>he convinced factory owners in Germany to get rid of the rats and the mice and</v>

86
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.820
<v Speaker 1>mice and insects in the factories and also to clean them up and beautify them.</v>

87
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.330
<v Speaker 1>But the gas they use to clean up the factories was like lawn a,</v>

88
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.040
<v Speaker 1>and it was the variation of that gas cycle on B that was then used in.</v>

89
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.341
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

90
00:02:37.341 --> 00:02:39.210
<v Speaker 1>So you could see this ramping up pay.</v>

91
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.860
<v Speaker 1>So it was,</v>

92
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:40.280
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

93
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.113
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

94
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.620
<v Speaker 1>So it was public health,</v>

95
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.410
<v Speaker 1>then it was social cleanliness.</v>

96
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.050
<v Speaker 1>Then he went into the asylums and cleaned them up.</v>

97
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.210
<v Speaker 1>And so it was just this expansion of,</v>

98
00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.270
<v Speaker 1>of who was contaminated and who was impure.</v>

99
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.430
<v Speaker 1>And I think also his fascination with fire and his use of fire symbolism was</v>

100
00:02:58.431 --> 00:02:59.840
<v Speaker 1>also associated with that,</v>

101
00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.340
<v Speaker 1>with that appealed to purification because the whole idea of purification by</v>

102
00:03:04.341 --> 00:03:05.960
<v Speaker 1>fire is a very ancient idea.</v>
