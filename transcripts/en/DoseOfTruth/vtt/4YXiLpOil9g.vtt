1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.450
<v Speaker 1>We the product of three and a half billion years of intimate relationships.</v>

2
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.640
<v Speaker 1>So you're not just going to step outside of that</v>

3
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.450
<v Speaker 1>from a different planet,</v>

4
00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:12.490
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.490
<v Speaker 1>Just get down to the fact that that's part of like fit and you know you want to</v>

6
00:00:17.691 --> 00:00:21.530
<v Speaker 1>have an intimate relationship and I think one that's longer lasting because you</v>

7
00:00:21.531 --> 00:00:26.531
<v Speaker 1>have your story and it's unfolding in your partner has her or his story and it's</v>

8
00:00:26.871 --> 00:00:29.660
<v Speaker 1>unfolding and then you weave those together like a road,</v>

9
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:30.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.940
<v Speaker 1>and that makes the story much,</v>

11
00:00:31.941 --> 00:00:32.451
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>

12
00:00:32.451 --> 00:00:36.710
<v Speaker 1>much stronger and it gives you some continuity but you like it gives you a past,</v>

13
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.830
<v Speaker 1>it's stable and it gives you a presence that's free on it gives you a future</v>

14
00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:40.510
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

15
00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:41.210
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

16
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.340
<v Speaker 1>it's solid and dependable.</v>

17
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.690
<v Speaker 1>It's something that you can rely on when everything around you is moving up and</v>

18
00:00:47.691 --> 00:00:49.040
<v Speaker 1>down far too rapidly.</v>

19
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:50.960
<v Speaker 1>And so you want to solve that problem.</v>

20
00:00:50.961 --> 00:00:53.780
<v Speaker 1>You know what you want to have you and maybe you want to take one sort of do you</v>

21
00:00:53.781 --> 00:00:55.640
<v Speaker 1>want to have an intimate relationship with?</v>

22
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.530
<v Speaker 1>It's probably not a pushover.</v>

23
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.230
<v Speaker 1>You want someone to give you a good slap when you need one,</v>

24
00:01:00.231 --> 00:01:04.220
<v Speaker 1>which is probably like six or seven times a day just to ask for one,</v>

25
00:01:04.221 --> 00:01:04.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

26
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.660
<v Speaker 1>When you wake up in the morning,</v>

27
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:06.581
<v Speaker 1>that's what you should do.</v>

28
00:01:06.581 --> 00:01:07.670
<v Speaker 1>You should turn to your wife and say,</v>

29
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.310
<v Speaker 1>your boss is just sloppy right now because doesn't deserve it.</v>

30
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.110
<v Speaker 1>And so you want someone like that and then slap him a little better.</v>

31
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.930
<v Speaker 1>Then you have some respect for them too because you,</v>

32
00:01:18.931 --> 00:01:19.181
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:01:19.181 --> 00:01:19.901
<v Speaker 1>you've tried something,</v>

34
00:01:19.901 --> 00:01:21.760
<v Speaker 1>a little trick that you think I can get away with this.</v>

35
00:01:21.761 --> 00:01:22.360
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

36
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.920
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

37
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.400
<v Speaker 1>did you I'm there.</v>

38
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.160
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

39
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:36.181
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

40
00:01:36.181 --> 00:01:36.481
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

41
00:01:36.481 --> 00:01:37.314
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

42
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.820
<v Speaker 1>what do you do about temptation?</v>

43
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.320
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

44
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.490
<v Speaker 1>succumb to it.</v>

45
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.380
<v Speaker 1>That's the wrong answer.</v>

46
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.120
<v Speaker 1>What is the reason for that?</v>

47
00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.610
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

48
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.320
<v Speaker 1>cause I can say what you know,</v>

49
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.070
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't succumb to temptation.</v>

50
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.710
<v Speaker 1>There's sort of a preachy finger waving,</v>

51
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.940
<v Speaker 1>thinking that it was all done with that.</v>

52
00:01:52.941 --> 00:01:54.080
<v Speaker 1>But that's not the,</v>

53
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.520
<v Speaker 1>what are the things I've learned about ethical behavior is the reason you should</v>

54
00:01:58.521 --> 00:02:00.320
<v Speaker 1>act ethically because there wasn't anything bad,</v>

55
00:02:00.321 --> 00:02:01.990
<v Speaker 1>but you could do like it's,</v>

56
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.380
<v Speaker 1>it's bad for you and for the future use and it's better for your family and it's</v>

57
00:02:06.381 --> 00:02:07.460
<v Speaker 1>better for everyone around you.</v>

58
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.780
<v Speaker 1>It's better.</v>

59
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.490
<v Speaker 1>It's not that you shouldn't do it,</v>

60
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.220
<v Speaker 1>that's wheat and you will rebel against that.</v>

61
00:02:13.221 --> 00:02:14.540
<v Speaker 1>Like who says I shouldn't do that?</v>

62
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:15.890
<v Speaker 1>That's not helpful.</v>

63
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:16.281
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

64
00:02:16.281 --> 00:02:16.411
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

65
00:02:16.411 --> 00:02:16.710
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

66
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.910
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

67
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.890
<v Speaker 1>you want to be sensible about this.</v>

68
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:19.753
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

69
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.601
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

70
00:02:20.601 --> 00:02:22.340
<v Speaker 1>why not take cocaine all the time?</v>

71
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:24.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

72
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a real cost.</v>

73
00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.500
<v Speaker 1>And the psychologist,</v>

74
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.210
<v Speaker 1>how often have this sort of thing backwards because psychologists,</v>

75
00:02:29.211 --> 00:02:29.411
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

76
00:02:29.411 --> 00:02:31.570
<v Speaker 1>I trying to tie themselves up with knots thinking,</v>

77
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.661
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

78
00:02:31.661 --> 00:02:32.840
<v Speaker 1>why are people addicted?</v>

79
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.380
<v Speaker 1>So like what sort of stupid question is that?</v>

80
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.890
<v Speaker 1>Tried your substance of choice.</v>

81
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.990
<v Speaker 1>You don't bloody well why people are addicted to it.</v>

82
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.400
<v Speaker 1>It's really fun.</v>

83
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.990
<v Speaker 1>Rid of your anxiety.</v>

84
00:02:46.991 --> 00:02:47.680
<v Speaker 1>You don't worry.</v>

85
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.891
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

86
00:02:47.891 --> 00:02:48.281
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

87
00:02:48.281 --> 00:02:48.770
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

88
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:49.140
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

89
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.080
<v Speaker 1>it's something and you can get isolated rats.</v>

90
00:02:52.081 --> 00:02:53.050
<v Speaker 1>It didn't fit to Pokemon.</v>

91
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.000
<v Speaker 1>You don't time flat.</v>

92
00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:55.590
<v Speaker 1>So there's no mystery about addiction.</v>

93
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.950
<v Speaker 1>The beneficiary is why aren't you addicted to doing impulsive things all the</v>

94
00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:59.793
<v Speaker 1>time?</v>

95
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.510
<v Speaker 1>Some of you probably are,</v>

96
00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:02.483
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

97
00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.881
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is,</v>

98
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:05.450
<v Speaker 1>you know what the consequences of that are.</v>

99
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.670
<v Speaker 1>It's a very short trip down hill and it's because what you're doing is</v>

100
00:03:09.671 --> 00:03:12.490
<v Speaker 1>maximizing pleasure in the moment,</v>

101
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.600
<v Speaker 1>but for going stability and achievement and,</v>

102
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.120
<v Speaker 1>and everything's solid really the medium to long term.</v>

103
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.840
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a pleasurable degenerated came and you had definitely a terrible</v>

104
00:03:22.841 --> 00:03:23.830
<v Speaker 1>place if that happens.</v>

105
00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:28.831
<v Speaker 1>So you have to figure out how to regulate temptation because it'll offer you and</v>

106
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.430
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't work.</v>

107
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.020
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

108
00:03:32.021 --> 00:03:34.420
<v Speaker 1>you have to regulate your alcoholic take if you have to be.</v>

109
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.950
<v Speaker 1>Some of the really likes alcohol,</v>

110
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.150
<v Speaker 1>if you're into recreational drugs or casual sex or anything like that,</v>

111
00:03:40.151 --> 00:03:41.050
<v Speaker 1>or pornography,</v>

112
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.790
<v Speaker 1>all these places that you could slide into that maximize immediate reward but</v>

113
00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:46.810
<v Speaker 1>costs you in the long run.</v>

114
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.250
<v Speaker 1>You have to have strategy for that.</v>

115
00:03:48.251 --> 00:03:48.820
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

116
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.980
<v Speaker 1>why should I drink every night?</v>

117
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.570
<v Speaker 1>You need a reason for that.</v>

118
00:03:52.571 --> 00:03:55.630
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is something like it's gotta be something like,</v>

119
00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:57.490
<v Speaker 1>I got better things to do.</v>

120
00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.990
<v Speaker 1>That's the right answer.</v>

121
00:03:58.991 --> 00:04:00.520
<v Speaker 1>I've got better things to do than that.</v>

122
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:01.743
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

123
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.640
<v Speaker 1>and then what else do you need to know?</v>

124
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.970
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to do with your life folks?</v>

125
00:04:05.971 --> 00:04:08.740
<v Speaker 1>I get work and I don't mean hobby Jesus.</v>

126
00:04:08.741 --> 00:04:09.401
<v Speaker 1>That's bad.</v>

127
00:04:09.401 --> 00:04:10.590
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad way of thinking about it.</v>

128
00:04:10.591 --> 00:04:11.950
<v Speaker 1>Like it's good if you have a hobby,</v>

129
00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:15.340
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't what you think about doing with your time outside of work.</v>

130
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.110
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's your life.</v>

131
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like what meaningful and productive engagements are you going to set up for</v>

132
00:04:23.861 --> 00:04:28.861
<v Speaker 1>yourself so that so that you're so that you can tolerate your existence.</v>

133
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.690
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

134
00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.970
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things the existential psychologist pointed out the 1950s and</v>

135
00:04:33.971 --> 00:04:35.340
<v Speaker 1>they were sort of suffering from,</v>

136
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:36.671
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it,</v>

137
00:04:36.671 --> 00:04:40.330
<v Speaker 1>cognitive aftermath of World War II and all the horrors that were revealed the</v>

138
00:04:40.331 --> 00:04:41.660
<v Speaker 1>World War Two is that they're,</v>

139
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.680
<v Speaker 1>their realization was that human beings owned something like a debt to</v>

140
00:04:44.681 --> 00:04:45.760
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>

141
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.940
<v Speaker 1>You know you have to pay the price for your wretched existence and the pay that</v>

142
00:04:51.071 --> 00:04:51.731
<v Speaker 1>price property.</v>

143
00:04:51.731 --> 00:04:54.910
<v Speaker 1>You have to be doing something noble and worthwhile and some of that's going to</v>

144
00:04:54.911 --> 00:04:57.220
<v Speaker 1>be your career and your relationship with your family and all that,</v>

145
00:04:57.221 --> 00:05:00.310
<v Speaker 1>but you need to have a vision for what it is that you're up to.</v>

146
00:05:00.311 --> 00:05:02.200
<v Speaker 1>When you're not otherwise engaged,</v>

147
00:05:02.201 --> 00:05:05.080
<v Speaker 1>what is it that you could be doing in the world that would be worth getting up</v>

148
00:05:05.081 --> 00:05:06.610
<v Speaker 1>for even when you're not well,</v>

149
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:07.660
<v Speaker 1>even when you're suffering,</v>

150
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.760
<v Speaker 1>even when someone close to you has died,</v>

151
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

152
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.040
<v Speaker 1>Even in the depths of tragedy,</v>

153
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.170
<v Speaker 1>what is it that you are going to engage yourself with?</v>

154
00:05:14.171 --> 00:05:15.070
<v Speaker 1>It makes you think,</v>

155
00:05:15.071 --> 00:05:15.730
<v Speaker 1>God dammit,</v>

156
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:16.210
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

157
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.050
<v Speaker 1>this is a rough day,</v>

158
00:05:17.051 --> 00:05:19.530
<v Speaker 1>but I'm getting the hell out of India.</v>

159
00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.340
<v Speaker 1>That's not being happy,</v>

160
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.001
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

161
00:05:22.001 --> 00:05:23.710
<v Speaker 1>This way more than being happy.</v>

162
00:05:23.711 --> 00:05:25.690
<v Speaker 1>This is what you do when you're not happy,</v>

163
00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.040
<v Speaker 1>and that happens to a lot in your life and you need an answer to that question</v>

164
00:05:30.041 --> 00:05:34.630
<v Speaker 1>for the times when things are really damp and dread and so you need to know what</v>

165
00:05:34.631 --> 00:05:35.620
<v Speaker 1>you wear.</v>

166
00:05:35.621 --> 00:05:36.040
<v Speaker 1>What are the,</v>

167
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.580
<v Speaker 1>where you're situated yourself.</v>

168
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.090
<v Speaker 1>One thing you can think of is that while you could,</v>

169
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.720
<v Speaker 1>you could think about trying to make the world a slightly less miserable place.</v>

170
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.231
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

171
00:05:44.231 --> 00:05:46.430
<v Speaker 1>that's not a bad place to start if you don't know what to do.</v>

172
00:05:46.431 --> 00:05:49.450
<v Speaker 1>And there's lots of things out there that aren't very good that you could</v>

173
00:05:49.451 --> 00:05:52.360
<v Speaker 1>probably help a little bit if you got your act together.</v>

174
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:53.710
<v Speaker 1>And so if you don't know what to do,</v>

175
00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:54.251
<v Speaker 1>you can take,</v>

176
00:05:54.251 --> 00:05:55.510
<v Speaker 1>well you don't,</v>

177
00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:56.750
<v Speaker 1>there's a problem out there.</v>

178
00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.230
<v Speaker 1>The whatever problem comes to mind for you to take.</v>

179
00:06:00.231 --> 00:06:05.231
<v Speaker 1>Well I can probably dare trying to solve that at a small level badly so that I</v>

180
00:06:07.071 --> 00:06:07.970
<v Speaker 1>get better at it.</v>

181
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.840
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

182
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:09.131
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

183
00:06:09.131 --> 00:06:09.460
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

184
00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.270
<v Speaker 1>when things are falling apart around me,</v>

185
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:12.051
<v Speaker 1>I can hit me say,</v>

186
00:06:12.051 --> 00:06:12.291
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

187
00:06:12.291 --> 00:06:15.920
<v Speaker 1>I've got this and this is how I'm contributing and that's a killer that you can</v>

188
00:06:15.921 --> 00:06:18.260
<v Speaker 1>rest on when things are falling apart.</v>

189
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:19.610
<v Speaker 1>It need that.</v>

190
00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.053
<v Speaker 2>And so</v>

191
00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:25.591
<v Speaker 1>education,</v>

192
00:06:25.591 --> 00:06:25.901
<v Speaker 1>so like,</v>

193
00:06:25.901 --> 00:06:26.171
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

194
00:06:26.171 --> 00:06:27.430
<v Speaker 1>well you don't,</v>

195
00:06:27.431 --> 00:06:27.710
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>

196
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:28.600
<v Speaker 1>you don't do enough.</v>

197
00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.160
<v Speaker 1>Obviously if that's a bad thing because the world's complicated and the more you</v>

198
00:06:33.161 --> 00:06:33.341
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

199
00:06:33.341 --> 00:06:36.220
<v Speaker 1>the less it's going to flap you horribly.</v>

200
00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.070
<v Speaker 1>And so it's good to educate yourself.</v>

201
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.070
<v Speaker 1>So you might have a plan for that too so that you can be a little bit more than</v>

202
00:06:42.071 --> 00:06:44.050
<v Speaker 1>you are everyday.</v>

203
00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:46.150
<v Speaker 1>And so I wrote a little about that too,</v>

204
00:06:46.151 --> 00:06:49.240
<v Speaker 1>which was comparing yourself to who you were yesterday and not to who,</v>

205
00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:50.920
<v Speaker 1>who someone else's today,</v>

206
00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:56.250
<v Speaker 1>which I wrote that rule very carefully because you need to have a name and if</v>

207
00:06:56.801 --> 00:06:57.700
<v Speaker 1>you have any infant stuff,</v>

208
00:06:57.701 --> 00:06:59.500
<v Speaker 1>people are going to be better at that than you.</v>

209
00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.030
<v Speaker 1>And then you get all emptiness about it.</v>

210
00:07:01.031 --> 00:07:02.040
<v Speaker 1>And not only entities,</v>

211
00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:05.020
<v Speaker 1>but pretty hard on yourself because like you're just not where you should be in</v>

212
00:07:05.021 --> 00:07:06.250
<v Speaker 1>relationship to that aim.</v>

213
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:09.790
<v Speaker 1>And that can make you very bitter displeased with the world.</v>

214
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:12.310
<v Speaker 1>But it's not a good way of looking at it that it's,</v>

215
00:07:12.311 --> 00:07:14.770
<v Speaker 1>it's even though you need that value structure,</v>

216
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:15.870
<v Speaker 1>you needed up,</v>

217
00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:17.290
<v Speaker 1>you need people who are above.</v>

218
00:07:17.291 --> 00:07:17.680
<v Speaker 1>You need to,</v>

219
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.720
<v Speaker 1>because at least their targets for emulation.</v>

220
00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:21.010
<v Speaker 1>But you can always fake.</v>

221
00:07:21.011 --> 00:07:21.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

222
00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:21.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

223
00:07:21.641 --> 00:07:26.230
<v Speaker 1>here I am now in my wretched form and without my false,</v>

224
00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:26.871
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

225
00:07:26.871 --> 00:07:30.220
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow I could be one 10th of 1% better.</v>

226
00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:32.080
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty good thing,</v>

227
00:07:32.081 --> 00:07:32.351
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

228
00:07:32.351 --> 00:07:34.960
<v Speaker 1>because you've got yourself as the target and you know,</v>

229
00:07:34.961 --> 00:07:37.060
<v Speaker 1>you can be slightly better than you are.</v>

230
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:38.103
<v Speaker 1>And then as you do that,</v>

231
00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:41.590
<v Speaker 1>and that does make you bitter or resentful to notice that you could be slightly</v>

232
00:07:41.591 --> 00:07:42.281
<v Speaker 1>better than you are.</v>

233
00:07:42.281 --> 00:07:43.690
<v Speaker 1>It's actually kind of hopeful,</v>

234
00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:44.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

235
00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:45.273
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

236
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:48.700
<v Speaker 1>well that's a pathway to improvement and so that's a good thing.</v>

237
00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:54.090
<v Speaker 1>And so you just started to do that as a meaningful way of engaging in the world.</v>

238
00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:56.460
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

239
00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:58.320
<v Speaker 1>That's a good thing to do with your time outside of her.</v>

240
00:07:58.321 --> 00:07:58.831
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

241
00:07:58.831 --> 00:08:02.310
<v Speaker 1>I laid all this out and this writing program and so then the kids would write</v>

242
00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:07.020
<v Speaker 1>their plan and it was really interesting watching this because this just blew me</v>

243
00:08:07.021 --> 00:08:07.854
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

244
00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:08.933
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

245
00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:10.640
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

246
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to describe it either.</v>

247
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:13.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like you don't,</v>

248
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:14.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

249
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.920
<v Speaker 1>when you look back at the past,</v>

250
00:08:15.921 --> 00:08:18.650
<v Speaker 1>you see the people had huge blind spots in their culture and you thought,</v>

251
00:08:18.651 --> 00:08:21.650
<v Speaker 1>well how the hell can people not notice that that was the case,</v>

252
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:22.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

253
00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.510
<v Speaker 1>but here's something we don't do.</v>

254
00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:24.920
<v Speaker 1>These students,</v>

255
00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.350
<v Speaker 1>they have been in school for like 60 years,</v>

256
00:08:27.351 --> 00:08:27.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

257
00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:30.620
<v Speaker 1>and they were pretty top of the rug students,</v>

258
00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.550
<v Speaker 1>smart,</v>

259
00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:32.630
<v Speaker 1>hardworking,</v>

260
00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:33.613
<v Speaker 1>most of them,</v>

261
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:35.030
<v Speaker 1>the vast majority of it,</v>

262
00:08:35.031 --> 00:08:37.450
<v Speaker 1>cause the u of t is actually a very conservative institution.</v>

263
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:40.520
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of children are first generation immigrants there and they're like</v>

264
00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:43.550
<v Speaker 1>pretty desperate about the job market and they're hitting their books pretty</v>

265
00:08:43.551 --> 00:08:43.851
<v Speaker 1>hard.</v>

266
00:08:43.851 --> 00:08:47.810
<v Speaker 1>So these are kids who have their eye on the prize mostly.</v>

267
00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:53.350
<v Speaker 1>No one had ever sat them down in their entire life and ask them to spend like an</v>

268
00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:58.890
<v Speaker 1>hour writing what sort of and they want it to be and why you ain't go,</v>

269
00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.150
<v Speaker 1>what the hell?</v>

270
00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.560
<v Speaker 1>What's going on with that?</v>

271
00:09:01.561 --> 00:09:06.090
<v Speaker 1>It's like how could we possibly have constructed an education system that would</v>

272
00:09:06.091 --> 00:09:11.091
<v Speaker 1>just spent 15 years trying to help people become educated and never once get</v>

273
00:09:11.971 --> 00:09:16.971
<v Speaker 1>them to think hard about who the hell they want it to be up to justify that.</v>

274
00:09:18.631 --> 00:09:19.740
<v Speaker 1>And you need to justify it,</v>

275
00:09:19.741 --> 00:09:19.921
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

276
00:09:19.921 --> 00:09:24.000
<v Speaker 1>Because imagine you lay out a path and then you get all doubtful about it</v>

277
00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:24.811
<v Speaker 1>because you will,</v>

278
00:09:24.811 --> 00:09:27.300
<v Speaker 1>especially if it's a difficult path and you run into challenges,</v>

279
00:09:27.301 --> 00:09:29.190
<v Speaker 1>know that you're all done.</v>

280
00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:31.020
<v Speaker 1>All that potential you have for thought.</v>

281
00:09:31.021 --> 00:09:33.900
<v Speaker 1>He's going to go after your planning like mad and try to bring you down.</v>

282
00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:34.830
<v Speaker 1>That's your doubts.</v>

283
00:09:34.831 --> 00:09:37.350
<v Speaker 1>It's like you need some arguments for those doubts.</v>

284
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.620
<v Speaker 1>You need like six reasons why what you're doing is a good idea.</v>

285
00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:41.910
<v Speaker 1>So when those doubts come up,</v>

286
00:09:41.911 --> 00:09:42.360
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>

287
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:42.770
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

288
00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:42.931
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

289
00:09:42.931 --> 00:09:43.320
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

290
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.153
<v Speaker 1>that's wrong.</v>

291
00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:47.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing this cause I got these six reasons that I'm doing this because I</v>

292
00:09:47.381 --> 00:09:49.130
<v Speaker 1>thought it all the way down to the bottom.</v>

293
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.080
<v Speaker 1>And if someone gets in your way in an inappropriate way,</v>

294
00:09:52.081 --> 00:09:52.980
<v Speaker 1>it's the same thing.</v>

295
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:55.680
<v Speaker 1>And if you have six reasons for what you're doing,</v>

296
00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:59.280
<v Speaker 1>no one will ever stop you because they'll Jack Day,</v>

297
00:09:59.340 --> 00:09:59.521
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

298
00:09:59.521 --> 00:10:00.660
<v Speaker 1>why aren't you doing that?</v>

299
00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:01.221
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

300
00:10:01.221 --> 00:10:01.351
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

301
00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:01.861
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

302
00:10:01.861 --> 00:10:04.830
<v Speaker 1>It's like you lose you've and you say,</v>

303
00:10:04.831 --> 00:10:04.981
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

304
00:10:04.981 --> 00:10:05.940
<v Speaker 1>here's the reason.</v>

305
00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:06.601
<v Speaker 1>And they say,</v>

306
00:10:06.601 --> 00:10:06.751
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

307
00:10:06.751 --> 00:10:08.340
<v Speaker 1>how do you justify that?</v>

308
00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:09.091
<v Speaker 1>And you go,</v>

309
00:10:09.091 --> 00:10:09.420
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

310
00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:10.560
<v Speaker 1>I have this reason.</v>

311
00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:11.341
<v Speaker 1>And then they say,</v>

312
00:10:11.341 --> 00:10:12.174
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

313
00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:13.103
<v Speaker 1>you're a pretty smart,</v>

314
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.370
<v Speaker 1>how do you justify that?</v>

315
00:10:14.371 --> 00:10:15.690
<v Speaker 1>And you have two other reasons isn't.</v>

316
00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:17.580
<v Speaker 1>Then they get angry and go away</v>

317
00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:22.740
<v Speaker 2>and you went for the [inaudible] gets</v>

318
00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:28.121
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

319
00:10:28.121 --> 00:10:31.060
<v Speaker 1>This as well as part of this narrative courts.</v>

320
00:10:31.061 --> 00:10:31.900
<v Speaker 1>And so again,</v>

321
00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:32.950
<v Speaker 1>they're writing like math,</v>

322
00:10:32.951 --> 00:10:34.180
<v Speaker 1>like 15,000 words,</v>

323
00:10:34.181 --> 00:10:34.780
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

324
00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:35.090
<v Speaker 1>And He's,</v>

325
00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:35.690
<v Speaker 1>they tell me,</v>

326
00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:37.570
<v Speaker 1>this is taking way longer than I thought.</v>

327
00:10:37.571 --> 00:10:37.870
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

328
00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:38.201
<v Speaker 1>Just like,</v>

329
00:10:38.201 --> 00:10:38.471
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

330
00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:38.681
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

331
00:10:38.681 --> 00:10:39.370
<v Speaker 1>it's your life.</v>

332
00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:40.203
<v Speaker 1>You don't sweat.</v>

333
00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:41.810
<v Speaker 1>Do it as,</v>

334
00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:43.240
<v Speaker 1>do it as thoroughly as you can.</v>

335
00:10:43.241 --> 00:10:44.240
<v Speaker 1>But I used to tell him to do,</v>

336
00:10:44.241 --> 00:10:46.150
<v Speaker 1>and this is a really good thing to know as well,</v>

337
00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:51.040
<v Speaker 1>you can write a really bad plan for your life and that's way better than no plan</v>

338
00:10:51.041 --> 00:10:51.730
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>

339
00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:54.760
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're going to figure out what you're going to do,</v>

340
00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:55.870
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be wrong.</v>

341
00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:59.590
<v Speaker 1>And so you don't have to get all perfectionistic about it because what the hell</v>

342
00:10:59.591 --> 00:11:00.400
<v Speaker 1>do you know?</v>

343
00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.730
<v Speaker 1>You're going to chart your course and then you're going to move forward in the</v>

344
00:11:03.731 --> 00:11:07.780
<v Speaker 1>world and you're going to occur experience as a consequence of moving forward.</v>

345
00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:10.390
<v Speaker 1>And then that's good if you would like to do enough so you be able to make a</v>

346
00:11:10.391 --> 00:11:11.224
<v Speaker 1>better plan.</v>

347
00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:14.110
<v Speaker 1>So all you have to do is make a plant that's good enough so that it gets you to</v>

348
00:11:14.111 --> 00:11:15.100
<v Speaker 1>your next plan.</v>

349
00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:19.540
<v Speaker 1>And I've also watched people for decades now they've asked me questions like</v>

350
00:11:19.541 --> 00:11:19.930
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

351
00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:21.640
<v Speaker 1>but what should I do if I don't know what to do?</v>

352
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.340
<v Speaker 1>And that's where is don't wait around.</v>

353
00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:28.780
<v Speaker 1>All you do is getting old and you get old way faster than you think and you'd</v>

354
00:11:28.781 --> 00:11:31.150
<v Speaker 1>like your 25 one day and then you're 40 the next.</v>

355
00:11:31.151 --> 00:11:34.870
<v Speaker 1>And if you're still 25 when you're 40 that's an ugly thing.</v>

356
00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.780
<v Speaker 1>It's an upbeat and you're not going to be happy about it.</v>

357
00:11:37.781 --> 00:11:39.670
<v Speaker 1>So make a stupid plan.</v>

358
00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:40.660
<v Speaker 1>And implemented,</v>

359
00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:42.530
<v Speaker 1>get bashed around by the world,</v>

360
00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:45.280
<v Speaker 1>it'll tell you what your plan is wrong and then you can reformulate it.</v>

361
00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:46.650
<v Speaker 1>And so had freezy off her bed.</v>

362
00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:46.901
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

363
00:11:46.901 --> 00:11:47.650
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

364
00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:49.540
<v Speaker 1>not that smart and I'm not that wise,</v>

365
00:11:49.541 --> 00:11:53.020
<v Speaker 1>but I can make a tentative plan as long as I stand back,</v>

366
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:54.640
<v Speaker 1>watch while I'm implementing it,</v>

367
00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.070
<v Speaker 1>maybe I could learn enough to get to the next step.</v>

368
00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:57.531
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

369
00:11:57.531 --> 00:11:58.120
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

370
00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:58.811
<v Speaker 1>That's perfect.</v>

371
00:11:58.811 --> 00:11:58.920
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

372
00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:00.580
<v Speaker 1>so that's a good thing to know.</v>

373
00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.170
<v Speaker 1>So the kids really liked that.</v>

374
00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:03.213
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

375
00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:05.650
<v Speaker 1>so then I got together with my partners and we thought,</v>

376
00:12:05.651 --> 00:12:05.771
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

377
00:12:05.771 --> 00:12:07.390
<v Speaker 1>why don't we try this on a larger scale?</v>

378
00:12:07.391 --> 00:12:08.020
<v Speaker 1>We'll just,</v>

379
00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:11.260
<v Speaker 1>we'll just build an exercise that people can do online at guided writing</v>

380
00:12:11.261 --> 00:12:13.080
<v Speaker 1>exercise and uh,</v>

381
00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:14.950
<v Speaker 1>let people try it and see what happens.</v>

382
00:12:14.951 --> 00:12:17.590
<v Speaker 1>So we tested it at Mcgill University.</v>

383
00:12:17.591 --> 00:12:18.640
<v Speaker 1>First we did a,</v>

384
00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:20.740
<v Speaker 1>we got these 80 kids who,</v>

385
00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:23.260
<v Speaker 1>who weren't doing well academically.</v>

386
00:12:23.261 --> 00:12:24.730
<v Speaker 1>So they were on academic probation.</v>

387
00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.970
<v Speaker 1>Now these are kids who had done pretty well in university or high school because</v>

388
00:12:27.971 --> 00:12:29.230
<v Speaker 1>they put the got into McGill otherwise,</v>

389
00:12:29.231 --> 00:12:30.760
<v Speaker 1>so they all had an eastern 80 average.</v>

390
00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:33.340
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have intellectual shortcomings,</v>

391
00:12:33.341 --> 00:12:36.580
<v Speaker 1>but you know the first year or two at university can be rough because you're</v>

392
00:12:36.581 --> 00:12:39.280
<v Speaker 1>adapting to the transformation of your life and all of that.</v>

393
00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:43.990
<v Speaker 1>And so then we put the kids into group one of two groups randomly at one group</v>

394
00:12:43.991 --> 00:12:48.991
<v Speaker 1>was right about you did a bunch of self analysis exercises and a bunch of a</v>

395
00:12:50.081 --> 00:12:51.520
<v Speaker 1>bunch of writing about who you were,</v>

396
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.980
<v Speaker 1>but it was all like questionnaire base.</v>

397
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:57.150
<v Speaker 1>And then the other one was this free writing exercise that was structured but</v>

398
00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:59.950
<v Speaker 1>help you outline what I just mentioned about your future.</v>

399
00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:01.090
<v Speaker 1>So the rest of the future,</v>

400
00:13:01.091 --> 00:13:02.040
<v Speaker 1>all three exercises.</v>

401
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:02.261
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

402
00:13:02.261 --> 00:13:02.961
<v Speaker 1>so you answer those,</v>

403
00:13:02.961 --> 00:13:03.910
<v Speaker 1>set the questions,</v>

404
00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:08.050
<v Speaker 1>then you develop a conceptualization of what you'd like your life to be at three</v>

405
00:13:08.051 --> 00:13:11.140
<v Speaker 1>to five years and you write about that for 20 minutes and you don't get too</v>

406
00:13:11.141 --> 00:13:11.910
<v Speaker 1>obsessive about it.</v>

407
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:12.221
<v Speaker 1>Just think,</v>

408
00:13:12.221 --> 00:13:12.461
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

409
00:13:12.461 --> 00:13:16.600
<v Speaker 1>if I could have what I needed to justify my existence,</v>

410
00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:18.010
<v Speaker 1>what would it look like?</v>

411
00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:19.180
<v Speaker 1>And then the second half is,</v>

412
00:13:19.181 --> 00:13:19.451
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

413
00:13:19.451 --> 00:13:22.120
<v Speaker 1>well now that you've got your vision in place,</v>

414
00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:25.000
<v Speaker 1>how about a strategy plan and strategy?</v>

415
00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:26.800
<v Speaker 1>So that that was the whole exercise.</v>

416
00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:28.540
<v Speaker 1>So we had kids in the guilty.</v>

417
00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:29.403
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

418
00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:34.440
<v Speaker 1>it produced a 30% decline in their probability of dropping the university.</v>

419
00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:38.410
<v Speaker 1>So that just blew us away.</v>

420
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:39.440
<v Speaker 1>What was the question?</v>

421
00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.273
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully for right,</v>

422
00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:43.030
<v Speaker 2>but at 25% improvement in her.</v>

423
00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:45.460
<v Speaker 2>So pool</v>

424
00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:47.590
<v Speaker 1>but also kind of sad because you think,</v>

425
00:13:47.591 --> 00:13:49.090
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>

426
00:13:49.091 --> 00:13:52.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean all of that had to happen was these kids had to have a plan and then I'll</v>

427
00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:56.050
<v Speaker 1>then they weren't like flapping about uselessly and blowing in the wind.</v>

428
00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:57.100
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>

429
00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:00.820
<v Speaker 1>would it be good if someone wouldn't be helping him develop a damn plan for like</v>

430
00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:04.840
<v Speaker 1>a third of the time thing where it's school so they would just home,</v>

431
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:05.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

432
00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:07.660
<v Speaker 1>They had a vision of who they want it to be wide,</v>

433
00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:10.510
<v Speaker 1>how would they were going to take their place in the world and we're encouraged</v>

434
00:14:10.511 --> 00:14:13.360
<v Speaker 1>to think that that is a worthwhile endeavor and that there were,</v>

435
00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:13.840
<v Speaker 1>there were,</v>

436
00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:17.920
<v Speaker 1>there were great things to do that they could be doing even on a local scale,</v>

437
00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:20.650
<v Speaker 1>like being a good husband or a good wife or a good father,</v>

438
00:14:20.651 --> 00:14:21.400
<v Speaker 1>a good mother.</v>

439
00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:25.870
<v Speaker 1>These are not trivial things are not trivial things that people should think</v>

440
00:14:25.871 --> 00:14:28.150
<v Speaker 1>about them seriously and they should take them seriously.</v>

441
00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.380
<v Speaker 1>Or to be a good neighbor,</v>

442
00:14:29.381 --> 00:14:30.214
<v Speaker 1>a good friend,</v>

443
00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.080
<v Speaker 1>or to be successful in your career,</v>

444
00:14:32.081 --> 00:14:32.914
<v Speaker 1>which is what then,</v>

445
00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:33.311
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

446
00:14:33.311 --> 00:14:35.860
<v Speaker 1>we really promote in our culture and fair enough,</v>

447
00:14:35.861 --> 00:14:37.030
<v Speaker 1>but it's not everything.</v>

448
00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:41.230
<v Speaker 1>So are things to do in the world that need to be done and there are problems</v>

449
00:14:41.231 --> 00:14:43.870
<v Speaker 1>that need to be solved and there's enough prompts for everybody.</v>

450
00:14:43.871 --> 00:14:44.620
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

451
00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:44.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

452
00:14:44.861 --> 00:14:47.200
<v Speaker 1>it'd be really good if we could tell our kids to get the hell,</v>

453
00:14:47.201 --> 00:14:49.870
<v Speaker 1>get their act together and get the hell out there and do something useful.</v>

454
00:14:49.871 --> 00:14:51.560
<v Speaker 1>And it's really good for them to that.</v>

455
00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:52.470
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

456
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:54.110
<v Speaker 1>so then if you get them to do that,</v>

457
00:14:54.111 --> 00:14:54.321
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

458
00:14:54.321 --> 00:14:54.560
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

459
00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.490
<v Speaker 1>make a plan.</v>

460
00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:56.320
<v Speaker 1>Poof.</v>

461
00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.670
<v Speaker 1>There are 30% less likely to drop out of the university.</v>

462
00:14:58.671 --> 00:15:00.410
<v Speaker 1>So we're pretty happy about this.</v>

463
00:15:00.411 --> 00:15:01.730
<v Speaker 1>But he's a small study,</v>

464
00:15:01.731 --> 00:15:02.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

465
00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.760
<v Speaker 1>40 and 40 maybe it only worked at McGill,</v>

466
00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:05.540
<v Speaker 1>who knows.</v>

467
00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:07.660
<v Speaker 1>So then we went to Holland woman there,</v>

468
00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:09.020
<v Speaker 1>pop the shippers.</v>

469
00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:09.860
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

470
00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:10.191
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

471
00:15:10.191 --> 00:15:10.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

472
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:13.790
<v Speaker 1>was a professor at the Rotterdam School of Management and she,</v>

473
00:15:13.791 --> 00:15:14.624
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

474
00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:17.780
<v Speaker 1>she decided that she would do this with all the first year business students.</v>

475
00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:19.550
<v Speaker 1>And so there's like a thousand of them.</v>

476
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:23.030
<v Speaker 1>And so they just did it as part of a course assignment.</v>

477
00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:24.380
<v Speaker 1>No instruction.</v>

478
00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:27.050
<v Speaker 1>They just have the program says write about your future.</v>

479
00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.910
<v Speaker 1>And so they aren't worried about their future.</v>

480
00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:33.020
<v Speaker 1>Say thing happened at about a 30% decline and drop up.</v>

481
00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:36.290
<v Speaker 1>But we did a little bit more distinct analysis this talk.</v>

482
00:15:36.291 --> 00:15:41.291
<v Speaker 1>So we stratified that the people into sex and ethnicity,</v>

483
00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:42.860
<v Speaker 1>just a rough cut.</v>

484
00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:47.510
<v Speaker 1>So we use Ben and women and we used western Westerners,</v>

485
00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:51.620
<v Speaker 1>the Dutch basically Dutch nationals and non western ethic wine words.</v>

486
00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:53.210
<v Speaker 1>And so that would be four categories.</v>

487
00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:56.780
<v Speaker 1>And then we looked out there their previous academic achievement.</v>

488
00:15:56.810 --> 00:16:01.310
<v Speaker 1>And so the people who are doing the best were the Dutch women and then the ducks</v>

489
00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:01.880
<v Speaker 1>ma'am.</v>

490
00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:05.080
<v Speaker 1>And then the non Western ethnic minority women and then the northern ethnic</v>

491
00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:09.020
<v Speaker 1>Western minority men and the no on ethnic western on minority net were</v>

492
00:16:09.021 --> 00:16:11.990
<v Speaker 1>underperforming the women by about 80% wall.</v>

493
00:16:11.991 --> 00:16:12.980
<v Speaker 1>A big difference.</v>

494
00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:17.870
<v Speaker 1>Now there was hundreds of people and we tested thousands of people in these</v>

495
00:16:17.871 --> 00:16:18.261
<v Speaker 1>samples.</v>

496
00:16:18.261 --> 00:16:19.040
<v Speaker 1>So the samples,</v>

497
00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.210
<v Speaker 1>saplings were very stable.</v>

498
00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:21.890
<v Speaker 1>We did it over a number of years.</v>

499
00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.800
<v Speaker 1>And so we fucking two things.</v>

500
00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:27.470
<v Speaker 1>The first thing is it had a bigger effect on men and on women.</v>

501
00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.980
<v Speaker 1>Now we think that's because the women are already doing better.</v>

502
00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:32.150
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're,</v>

503
00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:35.990
<v Speaker 1>if you're kind of set on something and you have a plaid that maybe making a plan</v>

504
00:16:35.991 --> 00:16:36.890
<v Speaker 1>doesn't help that much,</v>

505
00:16:36.891 --> 00:16:38.270
<v Speaker 1>but if you don't have a plan,</v>

506
00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:39.590
<v Speaker 1>it really helps.</v>

507
00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.510
<v Speaker 1>But this was the coolest thing.</v>

508
00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:46.520
<v Speaker 1>Two years after the group did this study did the,</v>

509
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:48.500
<v Speaker 1>did the exercise,</v>

510
00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:51.770
<v Speaker 1>the not western ethnic minority men were outperforming the Dutch women.</v>

511
00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:53.570
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

512
00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:53.930
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

513
00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:55.580
<v Speaker 1>There were hundreds of them in this sample.</v>

514
00:16:55.581 --> 00:16:57.140
<v Speaker 1>So it was a robust result.</v>

515
00:16:57.170 --> 00:17:01.100
<v Speaker 1>And so that just blew us away because for a bunch of reasons was first of all,</v>

516
00:17:01.101 --> 00:17:03.440
<v Speaker 1>well imagine if you're an immigrant to a new culture,</v>

517
00:17:03.441 --> 00:17:04.580
<v Speaker 1>you're pretty disoriented,</v>

518
00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:05.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

519
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.070
<v Speaker 1>Obviously cause that's part of being an immigrant.</v>

520
00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:10.970
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe it's even more important for you to get your bearings and figure</v>

521
00:17:10.971 --> 00:17:12.290
<v Speaker 1>out what you're doing and why.</v>

522
00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:13.520
<v Speaker 1>So about,</v>

523
00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:14.180
<v Speaker 1>so that was,</v>

524
00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:15.260
<v Speaker 1>that's one possible reason.</v>

525
00:17:15.261 --> 00:17:17.420
<v Speaker 1>But the other thing that was so cool is you always hear,</v>

526
00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:20.360
<v Speaker 1>especially in our culture now with its idiot political correctness and its</v>

527
00:17:20.361 --> 00:17:21.120
<v Speaker 1>identity,</v>

528
00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:22.870
<v Speaker 2>guess that the reason or</v>

529
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.020
<v Speaker 2>corrupt sociologists,</v>

530
00:17:28.021 --> 00:17:28.530
<v Speaker 2>geological</v>

531
00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:30.240
<v Speaker 1>conditions of the society,</v>

532
00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:33.810
<v Speaker 1>and obviously there's some truth in that because every society is ethnocentric</v>

533
00:17:33.811 --> 00:17:37.020
<v Speaker 1>at parochial to some degree in favor of the majority.</v>

534
00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.390
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like the definition of society.</v>

535
00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:42.960
<v Speaker 1>But here we get a psychological intervention and it completely obliterated the</v>

536
00:17:42.961 --> 00:17:45.240
<v Speaker 1>sociological effects completely.</v>

537
00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:46.410
<v Speaker 1>And so that was,</v>

538
00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:47.340
<v Speaker 1>that was just,</v>

539
00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:47.880
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

540
00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:48.151
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

541
00:17:48.151 --> 00:17:49.050
<v Speaker 1>you don't as a,</v>

542
00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:53.130
<v Speaker 1>you don't feel like doing a football touchdown dance very often.</v>

543
00:17:53.131 --> 00:17:55.710
<v Speaker 1>You don't see scientists in the hallway doing that sort of thing,</v>

544
00:17:55.711 --> 00:17:56.280
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

545
00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:01.020
<v Speaker 1>But that was something that we didn't expect that was really reliable and it was</v>

546
00:18:01.021 --> 00:18:02.370
<v Speaker 1>an absolutely excellent.</v>

547
00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:03.623
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

548
00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:08.660
<v Speaker 1>and then recently we did the same thing at Mohawk college in Canada.</v>

549
00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:14.140
<v Speaker 1>We had the kids come in and get prepared for university and their orientation,</v>

550
00:18:14.141 --> 00:18:17.940
<v Speaker 1>and they can either do the future authoring exercise for only 90 minutes.</v>

551
00:18:17.941 --> 00:18:20.040
<v Speaker 1>They just sit down at the computer and get it cold.</v>

552
00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:22.710
<v Speaker 1>They didn't even know they were going to be doing it as part of the [inaudible].</v>

553
00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:24.870
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe they have [inaudible] form only,</v>

554
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:28.200
<v Speaker 1>only minimally or they get some other exercise for 90 minutes.</v>

555
00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.470
<v Speaker 1>It dropped the dropout rate of Ben in the first semester.</v>

556
00:18:31.471 --> 00:18:34.890
<v Speaker 1>50% 50% yeah.</v>

557
00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:36.003
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

558
00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.640
<v Speaker 1>that part as well.</v>

559
00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:42.240
<v Speaker 1>And so if you have done very well in high school,</v>

560
00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:43.980
<v Speaker 1>it had a walloping effect on you.</v>

561
00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:48.390
<v Speaker 1>And if you also were in a program that didn't have like a professional</v>

562
00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:50.550
<v Speaker 1>designation at the end,</v>

563
00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:52.800
<v Speaker 1>so it was like a general arts program,</v>

564
00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:54.920
<v Speaker 1>then it also really had a whopping effect on you.</v>

565
00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:59.160
<v Speaker 1>So basically it was a program that was really good for people who have been</v>

566
00:18:59.161 --> 00:19:02.850
<v Speaker 1>doing very well because they were kind of lost and still hadn't specified a</v>

567
00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:06.150
<v Speaker 1>future 50% decrease in dropout in the first semester.</v>

568
00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:06.871
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

569
00:19:06.871 --> 00:19:07.141
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

570
00:19:07.141 --> 00:19:09.900
<v Speaker 1>Now the reason I'm telling you all that for a specific reason,</v>

571
00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:15.060
<v Speaker 1>and the reason is associated with this rule can be precise in your speech.</v>

572
00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:16.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

573
00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:19.810
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to get what you want those to specifier.</v>

574
00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:21.653
<v Speaker 1>That's the first thing.</v>

575
00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:24.030
<v Speaker 1>And there's a real reason for that,</v>

576
00:19:24.031 --> 00:19:25.140
<v Speaker 1>is that like,</v>

577
00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:29.550
<v Speaker 1>you actually create the world by specifying it in a much deeper sense than you</v>

578
00:19:29.551 --> 00:19:30.060
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

579
00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:33.600
<v Speaker 1>So I'll tell you the story about how psychologists discovered that because this</v>

580
00:19:33.601 --> 00:19:36.990
<v Speaker 1>is one of the great scientific discovery stories that you would say for the last</v>

581
00:19:36.991 --> 00:19:37.800
<v Speaker 1>20 years.</v>

582
00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.810
<v Speaker 1>Some of you probably know about this experiment already,</v>

583
00:19:39.811 --> 00:19:42.840
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think you necessarily know how revolutionary it was.</v>

584
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:43.761
<v Speaker 1>Scott named,</v>

585
00:19:43.761 --> 00:19:44.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

586
00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.320
<v Speaker 1>Dan Simon did these experiments.</v>

587
00:19:46.321 --> 00:19:48.360
<v Speaker 1>He published a paper called gorillas in that,</v>

588
00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:49.240
<v Speaker 1>in our,</v>

589
00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:51.050
<v Speaker 1>it's a study.</v>
