00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:06.930
Look,

2
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.330
it's unbelievably widespread.

3
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.320
So I'll give you an example that's very,

4
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:11.460
that's very similar.

5
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:12.780
Our Prime Minister,

6
00:00:12.781 --> 00:00:17.220
Justin Trudeau announced in 2015 that half the cabinet that he put together

7
00:00:17.221 --> 00:00:18.054
would be women,

8
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.231
right?

9
00:00:19.231 --> 00:00:20.850
The fact that only approximately,

10
00:00:20.851 --> 00:00:24.510
I think it was 20 to 25% of the elected officials were female.

11
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.020
And so what he basically admitted,

12
00:00:28.021 --> 00:00:29.010
as far as I'm concerned,

13
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.290
it was two things.

14
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.861
Number one,

15
00:00:31.861 --> 00:00:36.750
he was incapable of judging people on their competence because when you put

16
00:00:36.751 --> 00:00:38.940
together something like the cabinet for a country,

17
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.030
what you do is you find the most competent people period.

18
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.983
Because

19
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.300
it's so bizarre that it even has to be said because it actually turns out that

20
00:00:48.301 --> 00:00:49.560
the cabinet is important.

21
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.040
And so to me all he did was default on his cell is central moral obligation to

22
00:00:56.821 --> 00:01:00.960
screen every single one of his members of parliament with exceeding care and to

23
00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:02.580
pick the most qualified people.

24
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.200
And his rationale was that it was 2015 you know,

25
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.063
so,

26
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.900
and we to reduce competence to racial,

27
00:01:12.901 --> 00:01:13.620
ethnic,

28
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.880
gender identity,

29
00:01:14.881 --> 00:01:18.360
something like that is an absolutely appalling move.

30
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.100
Philosophically as well,

31
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:21.300
as far as I'm concerned,

32
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.200
to assume that diversity is somehow represented by group membership.

33
00:01:25.201 --> 00:01:26.340
There's no evidence for that.

34
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.340
There's absolutely no scientific evidence for that whatsoever.

35
00:01:29.341 --> 00:01:29.791
In fact,

36
00:01:29.791 --> 00:01:32.850
the scientific evidence suggests quite the contrary,

37
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.923
which is about,

38
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.740
there's more variability within groups than there is between groups,

39
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.310
which is actually an antidote to the central racist claim,

40
00:01:41.311 --> 00:01:41.581
right.

41
00:01:41.581 --> 00:01:43.230
Because the central racist claim is,

42
00:01:43.231 --> 00:01:46.920
there's more difference between groups than there is difference within them.

43
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.791
And so,

44
00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:48.240
you know,

45
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.740
you seen one black person,

46
00:01:49.741 --> 00:01:50.670
you've seen them all.
