<v Speaker 1>Dr peterson,</v>

2
00:00:11.481 --> 00:00:14.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm considering going into the education stream slash system.</v>

3
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.550
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any advice for me not to become a mouthpiece for indoctrinating</v>

4
00:00:19.551 --> 00:00:20.480
<v Speaker 1>young students?</v>

5
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.593
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.710
<v Speaker 1>one thing I would recommend is that you don't write essays that you don't</v>

7
00:00:27.711 --> 00:00:28.544
<v Speaker 1>believe in.</v>

8
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:30.710
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a sin.</v>

9
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.660
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a sin to use your words falsely and the reason for that,</v>

10
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.740
<v Speaker 1>like there's a good series of social psychology experiments that show,</v>

11
00:00:39.741 --> 00:00:44.210
<v Speaker 1>like imagine that you bring someone into a lab and you have them write an essay</v>

12
00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:48.470
<v Speaker 1>about or fill out a questionnaire about their political opinions so you get a</v>

13
00:00:48.471 --> 00:00:52.760
<v Speaker 1>baseline measure of their political stance and then you ask them to write a</v>

14
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.151
<v Speaker 1>thousand words.</v>

15
00:00:53.151 --> 00:00:54.770
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they identify as right,</v>

16
00:00:54.771 --> 00:00:55.460
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

17
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.960
<v Speaker 1>and then you get them to write a thousand word essay on why a particular left</v>

18
00:00:58.961 --> 00:01:00.740
<v Speaker 1>wing position is true,</v>

19
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.610
<v Speaker 1>and then you have them come back in two weeks and you give them the same</v>

20
00:01:04.611 --> 00:01:08.930
<v Speaker 1>political belief questionnaire they'll tell have shifted quite radically towards</v>

21
00:01:08.931 --> 00:01:09.764
<v Speaker 1>the left.</v>

22
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.060
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that people don't think through their positions in</v>

23
00:01:14.061 --> 00:01:14.960
<v Speaker 1>great detail,</v>

24
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.460
<v Speaker 1>and so if you get them to think through a contract position in great detail,</v>

25
00:01:19.461 --> 00:01:22.040
<v Speaker 1>then that starts to become more convincing.</v>

26
00:01:22.041 --> 00:01:27.041
<v Speaker 1>And so if you go into a field like education that's really pathologically</v>

27
00:01:27.681 --> 00:01:30.200
<v Speaker 1>overrun by the postmodern,</v>

28
00:01:30.201 --> 00:01:31.430
<v Speaker 1>neo Marxist types,</v>

29
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.330
<v Speaker 1>you're going to experience a tremendous amount of pressure to falsify your</v>

30
00:01:35.331 --> 00:01:35.721
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>

31
00:01:35.721 --> 00:01:37.550
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be afraid that if you don't do that,</v>

32
00:01:37.551 --> 00:01:39.170
<v Speaker 1>you're going to fail.</v>

33
00:01:39.171 --> 00:01:42.590
<v Speaker 1>And maybe sometimes you will be punished by a professor.</v>

34
00:01:42.591 --> 00:01:44.510
<v Speaker 1>But I would say in most circumstances,</v>

35
00:01:44.511 --> 00:01:48.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm still optimistic enough to believe that if you write a good essay that isn't</v>

36
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.090
<v Speaker 1>ideologically proper,</v>

37
00:01:50.091 --> 00:01:51.550
<v Speaker 1>you'll still get a good grade.</v>

38
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.220
<v Speaker 1>I guess I would say if you write a good essay that's not ideologically proper</v>

39
00:01:55.221 --> 00:01:56.360
<v Speaker 1>and you don't get a good grade,</v>

40
00:01:56.361 --> 00:01:58.190
<v Speaker 1>that's probably a good time to fight.</v>

41
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.490
<v Speaker 1>So because you either fight or capitulate,</v>

42
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

43
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:02.653
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

44
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.623
<v Speaker 1>that's the.</v>

45
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.030
<v Speaker 1>That's the hard truth.</v>

46
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.060
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not saying it would be easy and I would also say don't make unnecessary</v>

47
00:02:10.791 --> 00:02:11.271
<v Speaker 1>enemies,</v>

48
00:02:11.271 --> 00:02:11.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

49
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.990
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>

50
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.620
<v Speaker 1>Everything doesn't have to be a battle.</v>

51
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.911
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

52
00:02:13.911 --> 00:02:15.020
<v Speaker 1>And then you're going to know that,</v>

53
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.041
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

54
00:02:16.041 --> 00:02:20.060
<v Speaker 1>you'll hate writing the essay because you have to sacrifice your soul in order</v>

55
00:02:20.061 --> 00:02:22.210
<v Speaker 1>to put the words down and then you,</v>

56
00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.780
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

57
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.080
<v Speaker 1>you demand and warp your character and you just don't recover easily from that.</v>

58
00:02:27.081 --> 00:02:28.280
<v Speaker 1>So I would say,</v>

59
00:02:28.281 --> 00:02:29.030
<v Speaker 1>don't do that,</v>

60
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.570
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

61
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:30.380
<v Speaker 1>That's not good.</v>
