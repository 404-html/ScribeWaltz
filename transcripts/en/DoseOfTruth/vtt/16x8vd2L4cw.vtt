1
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.360
<v Speaker 1>I was starting to read the psychoanalysts and I really got,</v>

2
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.580
<v Speaker 1>I really got interested in what they had to say,</v>

3
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:12.780
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.830
<v Speaker 1>partly from reading Freud because I was really interested in his analysis of</v>

5
00:00:16.831 --> 00:00:18.480
<v Speaker 1>family dynamics and have dreams,</v>

6
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.640
<v Speaker 1>but more particularly from reading young.</v>

7
00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:22.630
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I learned from Yoga,</v>

8
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.280
<v Speaker 1>which really has never ceased to shock me,</v>

9
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.563
<v Speaker 1>was his,</v>

10
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:27.991
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

11
00:00:27.991 --> 00:00:29.310
<v Speaker 1>he basically made a point.</v>

12
00:00:29.311 --> 00:00:32.970
<v Speaker 1>And the point was that you're not master in your own house,</v>

13
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.920
<v Speaker 1>that there are forces that are,</v>

14
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.340
<v Speaker 1>are operating on you at an unconscious level that determine,</v>

15
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:41.671
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

16
00:00:41.671 --> 00:00:43.230
<v Speaker 1>the direction of your attention.</v>

17
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.731
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

18
00:00:44.731 --> 00:00:48.030
<v Speaker 1>you know how sometimes you'll read something in to really grip you and then</v>

19
00:00:48.031 --> 00:00:49.380
<v Speaker 1>you'll read something else and you like,</v>

20
00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:50.760
<v Speaker 1>you can't even concentrate on it.</v>

21
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:51.803
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>

22
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.991
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

23
00:00:51.991 --> 00:00:55.110
<v Speaker 1>I need to concentrate on this boring thing,</v>

24
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.591
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

25
00:00:55.591 --> 00:00:59.360
<v Speaker 1>cause an exam depends on it or a promotion and there's just no damn way you're</v>

26
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.760
<v Speaker 1>reading it and your attention flits all over the place and,</v>

27
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.840
<v Speaker 1>and you know you're undisciplined and all that,</v>

28
00:01:03.841 --> 00:01:04.560
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

29
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.290
<v Speaker 1>but then you have this other thing and it just grips you like this and you</v>

30
00:01:07.291 --> 00:01:07.501
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

31
00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:07.741
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

32
00:01:07.741 --> 00:01:08.574
<v Speaker 1>well what,</v>

33
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.810
<v Speaker 1>what's doing that?</v>

34
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.090
<v Speaker 1>It's not your will.</v>

35
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.240
<v Speaker 1>Because your will would be the thing that would allow you to concentrate on</v>

36
00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:17.400
<v Speaker 1>whatever you chose to concentrate on.</v>

37
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.450
<v Speaker 1>It's something underneath your will that's actually directing your attention.</v>

38
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.561
<v Speaker 1>And you could say,</v>

39
00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:23.430
<v Speaker 1>well it's random,</v>

40
00:01:23.431 --> 00:01:24.690
<v Speaker 1>but of course it's not.</v>

41
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.990
<v Speaker 1>It's maybe random if you have a serious case of schizophrenia.</v>

42
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.730
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

43
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.900
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

44
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.250
<v Speaker 1>and I think in some sense that's actually the definition of schizophrenia.</v>

45
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.540
<v Speaker 1>But it's not random.</v>

46
00:01:33.541 --> 00:01:35.160
<v Speaker 1>If you're a functioning human being,</v>

47
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.480
<v Speaker 1>the thing that grips your attention and directs it to one place or another is</v>

48
00:01:39.481 --> 00:01:41.670
<v Speaker 1>something that's what's a deep instinct.</v>

49
00:01:41.671 --> 00:01:44.250
<v Speaker 1>It's a manifestation of what union called the self,</v>

50
00:01:44.251 --> 00:01:45.810
<v Speaker 1>which is a very interesting idea.</v>

51
00:01:45.811 --> 00:01:47.220
<v Speaker 1>So human thought,</v>

52
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.480
<v Speaker 1>it's such a cool idea.</v>

53
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.430
<v Speaker 1>He thought that the mechanism that directed your attention in the present was</v>

54
00:01:53.431 --> 00:01:57.360
<v Speaker 1>your future self attempting to manifest itself in the present world.</v>

55
00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.351
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>

56
00:01:58.351 --> 00:02:03.351
<v Speaker 1>well you have a potential and that potential is what you could be in time.</v>

57
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.420
<v Speaker 1>And in order for that potential to manifest itself,</v>

58
00:02:06.421 --> 00:02:08.550
<v Speaker 1>it has to be palpable in the present.</v>

59
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.080
<v Speaker 1>And the way that instinct for further develop manifests itself in the present is</v>

60
00:02:13.081 --> 00:02:16.590
<v Speaker 1>by directing your attention towards things that are likely to increase your</v>

61
00:02:16.591 --> 00:02:18.930
<v Speaker 1>competence and further your growth right now.</v>

62
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.780
<v Speaker 1>And that's just an unbelievable idea.</v>

63
00:02:21.781 --> 00:02:22.021
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

64
00:02:22.021 --> 00:02:22.854
<v Speaker 1>it's like your,</v>

65
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.670
<v Speaker 1>your potential better self beckoning to you in the present.</v>

66
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.871
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

67
00:02:27.871 --> 00:02:30.690
<v Speaker 1>And I really can't think of a better explanation for it than that.</v>

68
00:02:30.691 --> 00:02:30.990
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

69
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.850
<v Speaker 1>that's a really good explanation but a very frightening one because it means in</v>

70
00:02:35.851 --> 00:02:37.020
<v Speaker 1>some sense that you're,</v>

71
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.760
<v Speaker 1>that something as fundamental as your attention is more or less controlled by</v>

72
00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:45.450
<v Speaker 1>processes that are so deep that you don't have a tremendous amount of voluntary</v>

73
00:02:45.451 --> 00:02:46.284
<v Speaker 1>control over them.</v>

74
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.780
<v Speaker 1>Like you can interact with the forces to some degree,</v>

75
00:02:48.781 --> 00:02:49.411
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

76
00:02:49.411 --> 00:02:53.250
<v Speaker 1>you're not one of those per creatures that can just tell yourself what to do.</v>

77
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.020
<v Speaker 1>Life would be really easy if that's what it was like right here.</v>

78
00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.710
<v Speaker 1>It's time to go to the gym three days a week,</v>

79
00:02:58.711 --> 00:02:59.471
<v Speaker 1>two hours a day.</v>

80
00:02:59.471 --> 00:02:59.890
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

81
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:00.131
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

82
00:03:00.131 --> 00:03:03.700
<v Speaker 1>you're superman in two years so you can eat properly and you know you're,</v>

83
00:03:03.701 --> 00:03:06.520
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to drink too much and you're not going to take cocaine and all</v>

84
00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:07.091
<v Speaker 1>of these things.</v>

85
00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:08.680
<v Speaker 1>He just tell yourself that and bang,</v>

86
00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:09.514
<v Speaker 1>you quit.</v>

87
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.680
<v Speaker 1>And it's kind of weird that it isn't that way,</v>

88
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.410
<v Speaker 1>but it's really seriously not that way.</v>
