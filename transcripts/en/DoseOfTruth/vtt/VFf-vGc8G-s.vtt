00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.860
<v Speaker 1>It's weird because normally for animals,</v>

2
00:00:08.861 --> 00:00:10.420
<v Speaker 1>what would be in the box of what should be,</v>

3
00:00:10.421 --> 00:00:14.470
<v Speaker 1>would be deep motivational states that are biological in origin.</v>

4
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.570
<v Speaker 1>So maybe an animal hasn't had enough to eat.</v>

5
00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.640
<v Speaker 1>And so park it's feeling hungry.</v>

6
00:00:18.641 --> 00:00:19.810
<v Speaker 1>That's undesirable.</v>

7
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.520
<v Speaker 1>It wants to have something to eat.</v>

8
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.890
<v Speaker 1>And so these different underlying biological systems like hunger and thirst and</v>

9
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.710
<v Speaker 1>and sexual lost and aggression and temperature regulation and so on.</v>

10
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.860
<v Speaker 1>They are what set the goals and the perceptual frame.</v>

11
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.551
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

12
00:00:33.551 --> 00:00:35.140
<v Speaker 1>and the emotional responses.</v>

13
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.430
<v Speaker 1>But in human beings we're so damn abstract that we can take that structure and</v>

14
00:00:39.431 --> 00:00:41.650
<v Speaker 1>we can put almost anything in that goal box.</v>

15
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.911
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

16
00:00:42.911 --> 00:00:45.370
<v Speaker 1>you can go to a soccer game and you can say,</v>

17
00:00:45.371 --> 00:00:48.260
<v Speaker 1>well I'm going to identify with my team.</v>

18
00:00:48.261 --> 00:00:52.090
<v Speaker 1>So you expand the boundaries of your current state of existence to incorporate</v>

19
00:00:52.091 --> 00:00:52.924
<v Speaker 1>the team.</v>

20
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.853
<v Speaker 1>And then you say,</v>

21
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.680
<v Speaker 1>well it's really important to me that these kicked that little round sphere</v>

22
00:00:56.681 --> 00:00:57.610
<v Speaker 1>through that net.</v>

23
00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.470
<v Speaker 1>And so your whole nervous system says,</v>

24
00:00:59.471 --> 00:00:59.831
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

25
00:00:59.831 --> 00:01:01.090
<v Speaker 1>well if that's the goal,</v>

26
00:01:01.091 --> 00:01:03.400
<v Speaker 1>we're going to align our emotions with that.</v>

27
00:01:03.401 --> 00:01:04.480
<v Speaker 1>And then you know,</v>

28
00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:05.560
<v Speaker 1>guys you don't know,</v>

29
00:01:05.561 --> 00:01:09.910
<v Speaker 1>run down the field and kick a little sphere through a nat and you're like up</v>

30
00:01:09.911 --> 00:01:10.450
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

31
00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.901
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:01:10.901 --> 00:01:14.110
<v Speaker 1>is celebrating in a way that you'd never do in your actual life.</v>

33
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like you don't do that when you get a good grade on an exam,</v>

34
00:01:17.921 --> 00:01:18.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.360
<v Speaker 1>jump up in the air and hug all your friends.</v>

36
00:01:20.361 --> 00:01:20.560
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

37
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.580
<v Speaker 1>you'll do that at a soccer game.</v>

38
00:01:22.581 --> 00:01:24.340
<v Speaker 1>It's like what the Hell is wrong with you?</v>

39
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.360
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

40
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.360
<v Speaker 1>but you do that because this is a very malleable and extendable frame and you're</v>

41
00:01:30.431 --> 00:01:31.750
<v Speaker 1>using it for everything.</v>

42
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.680
<v Speaker 1>When you go into a movie theater and you watch the protagonist,</v>

43
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.400
<v Speaker 1>you basically adopt his or her frame of reference and then you see the whole</v>

44
00:01:39.401 --> 00:01:43.230
<v Speaker 1>world that's portrayed on the screen through the eyes of the person that you're</v>

45
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.180
<v Speaker 1>identifying with as part of our capacity for imitation.</v>

46
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.890
<v Speaker 1>So basically what you do,</v>

47
00:01:47.891 --> 00:01:48.670
<v Speaker 1>what it seems,</v>

48
00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:49.503
<v Speaker 1>what you do there,</v>

49
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.750
<v Speaker 1>it's like if you're talking to someone else and you adopt their frame of</v>

50
00:01:52.751 --> 00:01:53.560
<v Speaker 1>reference,</v>

51
00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.630
<v Speaker 1>it's not exactly a cognitive operation.</v>

52
00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.880
<v Speaker 1>What you seem to do is first of all,</v>

53
00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.410
<v Speaker 1>come with to some understanding about what it is that they want.</v>

54
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.790
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the goal.</v>

55
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.320
<v Speaker 1>Once you know what they want,</v>

56
00:02:05.321 --> 00:02:07.510
<v Speaker 1>you can represent them in your body.</v>

57
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.500
<v Speaker 1>So it's almost like you're playing them as a simulation on your own biological</v>

58
00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:12.363
<v Speaker 1>platform.</v>

59
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.140
<v Speaker 1>And then you can infer from your own emotional responses if you also simulate</v>

60
00:02:17.141 --> 00:02:18.490
<v Speaker 1>the situation that they're in,</v>

61
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:19.750
<v Speaker 1>what their emotions are,</v>

62
00:02:19.751 --> 00:02:21.620
<v Speaker 1>and that enables you to understand other people.</v>

63
00:02:21.621 --> 00:02:26.170
<v Speaker 1>So were these weird biological computers that are capable of running other</v>

64
00:02:26.171 --> 00:02:28.390
<v Speaker 1>psyches on our biological platform.</v>

65
00:02:28.391 --> 00:02:31.390
<v Speaker 1>And that makes us able to imitate and also to understand each other.</v>
