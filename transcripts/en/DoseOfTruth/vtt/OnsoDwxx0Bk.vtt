1
00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.920
<v Speaker 1>So the other thing that we don't know is what price we paid for for accelerated</v>

2
00:00:11.921 --> 00:00:14.740
<v Speaker 1>Iq from from a broader perspective.</v>

3
00:00:14.741 --> 00:00:15.041
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4
00:00:15.041 --> 00:00:17.140
<v Speaker 1>because I know that there is some evidence,</v>

5
00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.810
<v Speaker 1>and you can tell me what you think about this because I know that there's</v>

6
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.900
<v Speaker 1>reasonable evidence that the average Iq of the Ashkenazi Jewish population is</v>

7
00:00:25.541 --> 00:00:28.900
<v Speaker 1>about 15 points higher than the standard population,</v>

8
00:00:28.901 --> 00:00:31.030
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of makes it a thought experiment.</v>

9
00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:32.170
<v Speaker 1>It's an experiment,</v>

10
00:00:32.171 --> 00:00:33.110
<v Speaker 1>real life experiment.</v>

11
00:00:33.111 --> 00:00:34.780
<v Speaker 1>It's equivalent to the one that you laid out.</v>

12
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.250
<v Speaker 1>But Aszkenazy Jews also tend to suffer from a host of neurological diseases that</v>

13
00:00:39.251 --> 00:00:42.070
<v Speaker 1>seem to be associated with increased neural plasticity.</v>

14
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.620
<v Speaker 1>And so to me it's often,</v>

15
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.220
<v Speaker 1>it's often hard to gain on one front without losing on another,</v>

16
00:00:48.221 --> 00:00:48.521
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:00:48.521 --> 00:00:51.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the evolutionary can hundred obviously,</v>

18
00:00:51.101 --> 00:00:54.110
<v Speaker 1>but we call that the social justice theory,</v>

19
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.880
<v Speaker 1>that one thing you have to be bad on everything else to kind of balance it out.</v>

20
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.470
<v Speaker 1>All these speaking,</v>

21
00:01:00.471 --> 00:01:01.910
<v Speaker 1>you do pay a price for your,</v>

22
00:01:01.911 --> 00:01:03.290
<v Speaker 1>for your exceptionalism.</v>

23
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.360
<v Speaker 1>You know that that's true.</v>

24
00:01:05.361 --> 00:01:06.400
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>

25
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.250
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

26
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.070
<v Speaker 1>the Julian Stanley's studies of the mathematic reaper,</v>

27
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.180
<v Speaker 1>cautious kids,</v>

28
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.011
<v Speaker 1>essentially,</v>

29
00:01:12.011 --> 00:01:13.610
<v Speaker 1>we found not only were they smart,</v>

30
00:01:13.611 --> 00:01:16.190
<v Speaker 1>but they were more mature than their age peers.</v>

31
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.571
<v Speaker 1>Better looking,</v>

32
00:01:17.571 --> 00:01:18.351
<v Speaker 1>they were color.</v>

33
00:01:18.351 --> 00:01:19.880
<v Speaker 1>They were physically more fit.</v>

34
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

35
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.030
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of the antisocial.</v>

36
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:23.150
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

37
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:23.721
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

38
00:01:23.721 --> 00:01:23.901
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

39
00:01:23.901 --> 00:01:24.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

40
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.850
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

41
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:25.090
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

42
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.430
<v Speaker 1>that also might be true because one of the things that,</v>

43
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.120
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

44
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.120
<v Speaker 1>that can interfere with Iq is poor health and poor nutritional quality and all</v>

45
00:01:33.981 --> 00:01:34.251
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>

46
00:01:34.251 --> 00:01:34.491
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

47
00:01:34.491 --> 00:01:36.950
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't look like it's that easy to increase Iq,</v>

48
00:01:36.951 --> 00:01:39.020
<v Speaker 1>but it looks like it's pretty easy to decrease it.</v>
