1
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.000
<v Speaker 1>And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand.</v>

2
00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:11.400
<v Speaker 1>All the prisoners that were in the prison whatsoever,</v>

3
00:00:11.401 --> 00:00:13.080
<v Speaker 1>they did there he was the doer of it.</v>

4
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.530
<v Speaker 1>The keeper of the prison look not to anything that was under his hand because</v>

5
00:00:16.531 --> 00:00:17.400
<v Speaker 1>the Lord was with him.</v>

6
00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:18.240
<v Speaker 1>And that what she did,</v>

7
00:00:18.241 --> 00:00:19.530
<v Speaker 1>the Lord made it to prosper.</v>

8
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.780
<v Speaker 1>So it's a repeat.</v>

9
00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.660
<v Speaker 1>It's a repeat of exactly what happened when he was the slave of the pharaoh,</v>

10
00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:31.010
<v Speaker 1>except it's one rung deeper into hell,</v>

11
00:00:31.011 --> 00:00:31.661
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

12
00:00:31.661 --> 00:00:31.901
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

13
00:00:31.901 --> 00:00:35.530
<v Speaker 1>So it's slave pharaoh and here it's prisoner jail master,</v>

14
00:00:35.531 --> 00:00:36.580
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter.</v>

15
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.510
<v Speaker 1>The same thing happens.</v>

16
00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.040
<v Speaker 1>So now Joseph has imprisoned and the Pharaoh has a fit one day of peak and</v>

17
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.330
<v Speaker 1>throws the chief of his Butler's into prison and the chief of his bakers and</v>

18
00:00:46.331 --> 00:00:47.170
<v Speaker 1>they have a dream,</v>

19
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.980
<v Speaker 1>each of them.</v>

20
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:48.390
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

21
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.223
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

22
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.020
<v Speaker 1>Joseph interprets the dreams,</v>

23
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.090
<v Speaker 1>just seems to be something that he can do.</v>

24
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:55.283
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

25
00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.530
<v Speaker 1>he tells the Butler that history means that the f Pharaoh was going to forgive</v>

26
00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:05.620
<v Speaker 1>him and put him back in his position and he tells the baker that the Pharaoh</v>

27
00:01:05.621 --> 00:01:07.340
<v Speaker 1>isn't going to forgive him.</v>

28
00:01:07.341 --> 00:01:10.370
<v Speaker 1>And that he's going to take off his head and hang them in a tree,</v>

29
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.980
<v Speaker 1>which rather rough dream.</v>

30
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.963
<v Speaker 1>But that is what happens.</v>

31
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.960
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens.</v>

32
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.130
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

33
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.130
<v Speaker 1>that the baker or the Butler goes free and Joseph says,</v>

34
00:01:19.131 --> 00:01:19.371
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

35
00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:19.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:01:19.641 --> 00:01:21.950
<v Speaker 1>maybe you could just keep in mind the fact that I</v>

37
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.820
<v Speaker 1>did you a bit of a favor here and told you something that was accurate but that</v>

38
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.460
<v Speaker 1>the chief didn't really remember once he,</v>

39
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:30.600
<v Speaker 1>once he was freed</v>

40
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.810
<v Speaker 1>interpreting dreams in prison.</v>

41
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.390
<v Speaker 1>And so now the pharaoh has a dream and he actually has two dreams.</v>

42
00:01:42.531 --> 00:01:44.540
<v Speaker 1>So it's another one of those doubled motifs.</v>

43
00:01:44.541 --> 00:01:49.541
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is these are really important dreams because they came in a pair and</v>

44
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.620
<v Speaker 1>behold there came out of the river seven well favored kind and fat fleshed,</v>

45
00:01:54.621 --> 00:01:57.490
<v Speaker 1>so cattle and they fed the meadow,</v>

46
00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.750
<v Speaker 1>meadow and behold seven other cattle came up after the motive.</v>

47
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.360
<v Speaker 1>The river ill favored and lean fleshed,</v>

48
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.130
<v Speaker 1>starving and stood by the other cows on the brink of the river and the ill</v>

49
00:02:09.131 --> 00:02:14.131
<v Speaker 1>favored and lean fleshed kind did eat up the seven well favored and fat.</v>

50
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.881
<v Speaker 1>So feral,</v>

51
00:02:15.881 --> 00:02:16.900
<v Speaker 1>it woke pay,</v>

52
00:02:16.901 --> 00:02:17.500
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>

53
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.760
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty nasty dream.</v>

54
00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.810
<v Speaker 1>And then he has another dream big go to hit it home and he slept and dreamt the</v>

55
00:02:25.001 --> 00:02:25.601
<v Speaker 1>second time.</v>

56
00:02:25.601 --> 00:02:30.601
<v Speaker 1>And behold seven years of corn came up upon one stock rank and good and behold</v>

57
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.080
<v Speaker 1>seven thin years and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them and the</v>

58
00:02:35.081 --> 00:02:38.140
<v Speaker 1>seven thin years devoured the seven rank and full years.</v>

59
00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.820
<v Speaker 1>And Pharaoh woke and beheld it was a dream and then it says a little later.</v>

60
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.880
<v Speaker 1>And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice.</v>

61
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.270
<v Speaker 1>It is because the thing is established by God and God will shortly bring it to</v>

62
00:02:49.271 --> 00:02:50.050
<v Speaker 1>pass.</v>

63
00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.771
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting,</v>

64
00:02:50.771 --> 00:02:50.951
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

65
00:02:50.951 --> 00:02:55.750
<v Speaker 1>because one of the better theories about dreams is that they're part of the way</v>

66
00:02:55.751 --> 00:02:59.380
<v Speaker 1>that the right and left hemisphere communicate or maybe the nonverbal of the</v>

67
00:02:59.381 --> 00:03:01.030
<v Speaker 1>brain communicates with the verbal brain,</v>

68
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.260
<v Speaker 1>verbal part of the brain.</v>

69
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.800
<v Speaker 1>And so the nonverbal part of the brain which is less differentiated and thinks</v>

70
00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:09.821
<v Speaker 1>more globally,</v>

71
00:03:09.821 --> 00:03:13.420
<v Speaker 1>is looking for patterns and anomalies in the world.</v>

72
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.800
<v Speaker 1>Things that don't fit well with the current way of conceptualizing the world.</v>

73
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.280
<v Speaker 1>Things that make you anxious and uncertain and those are things you haven't</v>

74
00:03:21.281 --> 00:03:21.791
<v Speaker 1>mastered,</v>

75
00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:21.971
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

76
00:03:21.971 --> 00:03:25.750
<v Speaker 1>So they don't fit well into your conception of realization of the world by</v>

77
00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:26.380
<v Speaker 1>definition.</v>

78
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.090
<v Speaker 1>Because if you had mastered them,</v>

79
00:03:28.091 --> 00:03:29.110
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't make you anxious,</v>

80
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.890
<v Speaker 1>nervous.</v>

81
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.790
<v Speaker 1>And so the the nonverbal parts of your brain or like an alarm system,</v>

82
00:03:33.791 --> 00:03:38.350
<v Speaker 1>they're looking around for places where you're probably wrong and then they put</v>

83
00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:43.351
<v Speaker 1>those in images and try to conceptualize them so that you can update your model</v>

84
00:03:43.511 --> 00:03:45.130
<v Speaker 1>of reality to take them into account.</v>

85
00:03:45.131 --> 00:03:47.620
<v Speaker 1>But that also produces a fair bit of negative emotion,</v>

86
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:48.790
<v Speaker 1>especially at night.</v>

87
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.433
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

88
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.090
<v Speaker 1>so we know that we know if you deprive people of dreams that they go insane very</v>

89
00:03:58.091 --> 00:03:58.660
<v Speaker 1>rapidly.</v>

90
00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:59.710
<v Speaker 1>Animals as well,</v>

91
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.840
<v Speaker 1>necessary part of mental equilibrium.</v>

92
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.490
<v Speaker 1>The way you do that with rats in Casey want to know is that you've got rats that</v>

93
00:04:06.491 --> 00:04:07.324
<v Speaker 1>you want to drive insane.</v>

94
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.273
<v Speaker 1>This is how you do it.</v>

95
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.270
<v Speaker 1>So you put the rat on a like a pedestal.</v>

96
00:04:12.271 --> 00:04:13.270
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty small.</v>

97
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:14.530
<v Speaker 1>And then when he fought,</v>

98
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.110
<v Speaker 1>that's surrounded by water and then when he falls asleep,</v>

99
00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:18.910
<v Speaker 1>his nose hits the water,</v>

100
00:04:18.911 --> 00:04:19.631
<v Speaker 1>then he wakes up.</v>

101
00:04:19.631 --> 00:04:21.340
<v Speaker 1>And so you can deprive the route of sleep.</v>

102
00:04:21.341 --> 00:04:22.600
<v Speaker 1>And that doesn't,</v>

103
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.440
<v Speaker 1>the rats don't respond to that very well after some period of time.</v>

104
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.240
<v Speaker 1>So that's one of the ways that that's been discovered.</v>

105
00:04:31.241 --> 00:04:32.074
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

106
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.300
<v Speaker 1>the dream does seem to be an update mechanism.</v>

107
00:04:34.301 --> 00:04:35.650
<v Speaker 1>And so if,</v>

108
00:04:35.651 --> 00:04:36.100
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

109
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.630
<v Speaker 1>if you have a very powerful dream,</v>

110
00:04:37.631 --> 00:04:38.470
<v Speaker 1>like a nightmare,</v>

111
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:39.790
<v Speaker 1>especially if it's repeating,</v>

112
00:04:39.791 --> 00:04:43.840
<v Speaker 1>it's like something is trying to hammer on the door that needs to be let in,</v>

113
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.420
<v Speaker 1>and often you don't know how to let it in and that's,</v>

114
00:04:46.421 --> 00:04:47.200
<v Speaker 1>that's a problem.</v>
