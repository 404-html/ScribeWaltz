1
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.420
<v Speaker 1>What should teaching and research in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>humanities look like?</v>

2
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to Grad School for literature</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't want my work to serve the</v>

3
00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:18.570
<v Speaker 1>ideological possession.</v>

4
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing is,</v>

5
00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:33.560
<v Speaker 1>first of all is that it kind of have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>educate yourself.</v>

6
00:00:33.561 --> 00:00:37.700
<v Speaker 1>When you go to graduate school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you have your courses,</v>

7
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.910
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that you learn more</v>
<v Speaker 1>than about 10% of what graduate school</v>

8
00:00:44.061 --> 00:00:47.540
<v Speaker 1>can teach you by taking the courses you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to read.</v>

9
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.100
<v Speaker 1>And the mistake that most people read is</v>
<v Speaker 1>make is that they only read what's been</v>

10
00:00:52.101 --> 00:00:56.270
<v Speaker 1>published in the last five or six years</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their own narrow field and that's</v>

11
00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.810
<v Speaker 1>increasingly a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

12
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.950
<v Speaker 1>the libraries are full of classic books</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would say take your field,</v>

13
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.320
<v Speaker 1>go back to the beginning of the field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least read the people who wrote the</v>

14
00:01:12.321 --> 00:01:15.620
<v Speaker 1>classic works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bring yourself up to date and then</v>

15
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.920
<v Speaker 1>familiarize yourself with as much</v>
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>

16
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.850
<v Speaker 1>as much history of art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as much history of literature and</v>

17
00:01:22.851 --> 00:01:24.890
<v Speaker 1>literature as you can possibly manage.</v>

18
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.460
<v Speaker 1>You want to learn as much as you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>about everything.</v>

19
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.330
<v Speaker 1>I would also say you have to ally that</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a certain degree of specialization.</v>

20
00:01:32.331 --> 00:01:34.790
<v Speaker 1>You have to pick one topic and really</v>
<v Speaker 1>become expert at it,</v>

21
00:01:34.791 --> 00:01:38.180
<v Speaker 1>but it'll serve as a doorway to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because everything's connected,</v>

22
00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:40.220
<v Speaker 1>it'll serve as a doorway to what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind it.</v>

23
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.410
<v Speaker 1>So you focus on one thing and read as</v>
<v Speaker 1>much as you can on that.</v>

24
00:01:45.411 --> 00:01:48.110
<v Speaker 1>That's your specific discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then outside of that,</v>

25
00:01:48.111 --> 00:01:50.210
<v Speaker 1>read as widely as you possibly can</v>
<v Speaker 1>manage.</v>

26
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.980
<v Speaker 1>The other thing I would really</v>
<v Speaker 1>recommend,</v>

27
00:01:51.981 --> 00:01:54.050
<v Speaker 1>and this is also true if you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>university,</v>

28
00:01:54.051 --> 00:01:58.760
<v Speaker 1>is it isn't enough to read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You also have to write and if you're</v>

29
00:01:58.761 --> 00:02:01.010
<v Speaker 1>going to go to graduate school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should write every day.</v>

30
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.120
<v Speaker 1>It's a good idea for anyone who wants to</v>
<v Speaker 1>develop themselves intellectually,</v>

31
00:02:05.121 --> 00:02:07.240
<v Speaker 1>but even half an hour a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.840
<v Speaker 1>that's 180 hours a year.</v>

33
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.830
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of thinking because writing</v>
<v Speaker 1>is thinking and you should be writing</v>

34
00:02:12.831 --> 00:02:17.831
<v Speaker 1>out your understanding of what you wrote</v>
<v Speaker 1>or what you read and the questions you</v>

35
00:02:18.111 --> 00:02:22.550
<v Speaker 1>have about it and trying to formulate</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you regard as clear questions and</v>

36
00:02:22.551 --> 00:02:25.120
<v Speaker 1>problems and also clear answers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

37
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.550
<v Speaker 1>both of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's how I would say you should</v>

38
00:02:28.551 --> 00:02:32.300
<v Speaker 1>approach graduate school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you thought about slowing down</v>

39
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.950
<v Speaker 1>there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were people worried about how hard</v>

40
00:02:33.951 --> 00:02:36.800
<v Speaker 1>you're pushing yourself with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>countless commitments?</v>

41
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.931
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

42
00:02:38.931 --> 00:02:42.170
<v Speaker 1>I would say that those people worried</v>
<v Speaker 1>about that include,</v>

43
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.600
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's me,</v>

44
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.450
<v Speaker 1>but certainly my family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're worried about it,</v>

45
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.930
<v Speaker 1>but I'm putting competent people around</v>
<v Speaker 1>me increasingly to handle the scheduling</v>

46
00:02:53.241 --> 00:02:55.100
<v Speaker 1>of the public events,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

47
00:02:55.101 --> 00:02:57.890
<v Speaker 1>And I have good agents in a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>publisher and,</v>

48
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm learning how to manage this.</v>

49
00:03:02.521 --> 00:03:05.730
<v Speaker 1>I think I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really interested,</v>

50
00:03:05.731 --> 00:03:09.570
<v Speaker 1>I suppose in slowing down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it has been a bit much in the</v>

51
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.400
<v Speaker 1>last year and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

52
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.790
<v Speaker 1>I do better in some ways when I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>working flat out.</v>

53
00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.790
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if my health was good,</v>

54
00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.070
<v Speaker 1>it's better than it was by a large</v>
<v Speaker 1>margin.</v>

55
00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.370
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it's still getting better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If my health was good,</v>

56
00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:28.850
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of this would be an overwhelming</v>

57
00:03:28.851 --> 00:03:31.940
<v Speaker 1>challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm trying to do everything I can to</v>

58
00:03:31.941 --> 00:03:35.540
<v Speaker 1>put my health in order and many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many things have been fixed.</v>

59
00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.840
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

60
00:03:38.841 --> 00:03:42.050
<v Speaker 1>I thought about slowing down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've decided against it I guess is</v>

61
00:03:42.051 --> 00:03:45.740
<v Speaker 1>really the final answer to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing.</v>

62
00:03:45.741 --> 00:03:49.010
<v Speaker 1>You know there are times in your life</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's not time to slow down.</v>

63
00:03:49.011 --> 00:03:49.850
<v Speaker 1>It's time to,</v>

64
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:51.190
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

65
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.200
<v Speaker 1>become more efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

66
00:03:53.201 --> 00:03:55.540
<v Speaker 1>You can become so efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

67
00:03:55.541 --> 00:03:59.320
<v Speaker 1>you end up doing things in five minutes</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would otherwise take you a week</v>

68
00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.330
<v Speaker 1>might.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That might seem like an exaggeration,</v>

69
00:04:01.331 --> 00:04:03.370
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I suppose it is to some degree,</v>

70
00:04:03.371 --> 00:04:05.320
<v Speaker 1>but it's not that much of an</v>
<v Speaker 1>exaggeration.</v>

71
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.690
<v Speaker 1>So as you take on more responsibilities</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you determine that you're going to</v>

72
00:04:10.691 --> 00:04:13.240
<v Speaker 1>become more efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the responsibility pushes the</v>

73
00:04:13.241 --> 00:04:15.400
<v Speaker 1>efficiency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

74
00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.020
<v Speaker 1>what do they say too?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's time enough to sleep when you're</v>

75
00:04:21.021 --> 00:04:26.021
<v Speaker 1>in the grave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many who respect your work feel your</v>

76
00:04:31.561 --> 00:04:34.590
<v Speaker 1>tweets are often impulsive or even</v>
<v Speaker 1>expedient.</v>

77
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.650
<v Speaker 1>Very funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In certain interactions,</v>

78
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.560
<v Speaker 1>would you consider a change in the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tweet?</v>

79
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been considering that for a very</v>

80
00:04:45.721 --> 00:04:48.240
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I did in the last</v>

81
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.040
<v Speaker 1>month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which that I think was productive.</v>

82
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.360
<v Speaker 1>Twitter's a hard disc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard medium to manage because it rewards</v>

83
00:04:54.361 --> 00:04:59.361
<v Speaker 1>impulsivity and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have somewhat of a temper and I</v>

84
00:04:59.641 --> 00:05:04.641
<v Speaker 1>suspect that it's maybe I'm more</v>
<v Speaker 1>susceptible to being,</v>

85
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:11.010
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to being tempted to respond in a</v>

86
00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.930
<v Speaker 1>too forceful manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'm more tempted by that than I</v>

87
00:05:17.931 --> 00:05:19.580
<v Speaker 1>should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

88
00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.270
<v Speaker 1>but Twitter is real useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it does keep me updated with</v>

89
00:05:25.271 --> 00:05:27.610
<v Speaker 1>regards to the ongoing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

90
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.820
<v Speaker 1>war that's raging at the bottom of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture and it does enable me to stay in</v>

91
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.640
<v Speaker 1>contact with people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least to some degree.</v>

92
00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:40.000
<v Speaker 1>And it's a great way of communicating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

93
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:45.150
<v Speaker 1>small but at least in principle</v>
<v Speaker 1>important ideas and also to let people</v>

94
00:05:45.911 --> 00:05:50.150
<v Speaker 1>know about what I'm doing on youtube and</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the tours and,</v>

95
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.530
<v Speaker 1>and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People seem to</v>

96
00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.240
<v Speaker 1>respond positively to those of</v>
<v Speaker 1>notifications.</v>

97
00:05:58.241 --> 00:06:03.241
<v Speaker 1>So what I did do in the last month was</v>
<v Speaker 1>to find people.</v>

98
00:06:03.441 --> 00:06:06.650
<v Speaker 1>I tweeted out one day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked people to send me the Twitter</v>

99
00:06:06.651 --> 00:06:11.651
<v Speaker 1>handles of organizations or individuals</v>
<v Speaker 1>who were reporting on positive</v>

100
00:06:11.691 --> 00:06:14.180
<v Speaker 1>developments in a credible and realistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

101
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.150
<v Speaker 1>Human progress.org seems to be doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that really well.</v>

102
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.600
<v Speaker 1>I thought it would be good to tilt my</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twitter feed toward or my Twitter,</v>

103
00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my actions towards things that are</v>

104
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:32.660
<v Speaker 1>positive and also true as much as</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

105
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.570
<v Speaker 1>And so I've started doing that in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>last month.</v>

106
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:40.250
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel somewhat of an obligation to,</v>

107
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:47.140
<v Speaker 1>if I'm being discussed publicly by</v>
<v Speaker 1>journalists or,</v>

108
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.640
<v Speaker 1>or other professors and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>misrepresent me or misrepresent the</v>

109
00:06:52.641 --> 00:06:55.160
<v Speaker 1>ideas that they're purporting to</v>
<v Speaker 1>discuss,</v>

110
00:06:55.161 --> 00:06:57.710
<v Speaker 1>then I feel like I have a moral</v>
<v Speaker 1>obligation to,</v>

111
00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:04.450
<v Speaker 1>I suppose one is to defend myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose,</v>

112
00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:10.320
<v Speaker 1>and certainly to object to the miss</v>
<v Speaker 1>utilization of ideas by my fellow</v>

113
00:07:10.761 --> 00:07:12.940
<v Speaker 1>academics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's a,</v>

114
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.073
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

115
00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:18.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's reasonable or</v>
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>

116
00:07:18.361 --> 00:07:21.390
<v Speaker 1>It's not easy to figure out in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation like this,</v>

117
00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:25.260
<v Speaker 1>how much you shut up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much you stay patient,</v>

118
00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:28.020
<v Speaker 1>how much you push back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much you fight,</v>

119
00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:31.740
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how firmly you respond,</v>

120
00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:36.470
<v Speaker 1>whether or not to use wet</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean.</v>

121
00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:38.480
<v Speaker 1>The rule I tried to outline in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

122
00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:44.150
<v Speaker 1>in my book 12 rules for life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a chapter called,</v>

123
00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:46.370
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

124
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.740
<v Speaker 1>don't let your children do anything that</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes you dislike them.</v>

125
00:07:48.741 --> 00:07:51.240
<v Speaker 1>And there's a philosophy of discipline</v>
<v Speaker 1>in there and,</v>

126
00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.920
<v Speaker 1>and it really has two dimensions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

127
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:56.750
<v Speaker 1>or two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

128
00:07:56.751 --> 00:08:01.460
<v Speaker 1>it's at the juncture of two ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One idea is that you don't want to make</v>

129
00:08:01.461 --> 00:08:04.820
<v Speaker 1>any more rules that necessary because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get tangled up in them.</v>

130
00:08:04.821 --> 00:08:09.320
<v Speaker 1>So minimum necessary rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a good guideline for setting</v>

131
00:08:09.321 --> 00:08:13.970
<v Speaker 1>up any structure even in dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

132
00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:18.410
<v Speaker 1>And then if you're going to have rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to enforce them because</v>

133
00:08:18.411 --> 00:08:23.150
<v Speaker 1>otherwise they're not rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so how do you enforce them with</v>

134
00:08:23.151 --> 00:08:28.151
<v Speaker 1>minimal necessary force?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some of that has to be played with,</v>

135
00:08:28.971 --> 00:08:30.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and experimented with.</v>

136
00:08:30.171 --> 00:08:31.760
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what minimal force is.</v>

137
00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:35.840
<v Speaker 1>Those are really good principles and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to govern myself by them in my</v>

138
00:08:35.841 --> 00:08:39.410
<v Speaker 1>Twitter behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

139
00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:43.430
<v Speaker 1>and I hope that that successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

140
00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes when I've gone after people,</v>

141
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.080
<v Speaker 1>I went after a couple of journalists in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada last year who</v>

142
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.030
<v Speaker 1>wrote I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I regard as scurrilous and</v>

143
00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.400
<v Speaker 1>incompetent articles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad combination.</v>

144
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:04.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of a harsh exchange I would</v>

145
00:09:04.921 --> 00:09:09.140
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't clear that it was the wrong</v>

146
00:09:09.141 --> 00:09:11.630
<v Speaker 1>thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

147
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:18.510
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to know how much you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>skirt the ragged edge of disaster if you</v>

148
00:09:18.511 --> 00:09:22.920
<v Speaker 1>want to do things right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

149
00:09:22.921 --> 00:09:26.910
<v Speaker 1>I am changing the way I tweet because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to make it the bulk of it</v>

150
00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:30.990
<v Speaker 1>informative and positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I should say something about</v>

151
00:09:30.991 --> 00:09:31.591
<v Speaker 1>that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

152
00:09:31.591 --> 00:09:34.620
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of really good things</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on in the world.</v>

153
00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:40.070
<v Speaker 1>So we have poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute poverty between the year 2000</v>

154
00:09:41.461 --> 00:09:45.840
<v Speaker 1>and 2012 which was three years ahead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the UN had hoped would happen.</v>

155
00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:47.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and cynics say,</v>

156
00:09:47.821 --> 00:09:52.821
<v Speaker 1>well you have the absolute poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the cutoff was kind of arbitrary.</v>

157
00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.130
<v Speaker 1>It was a dollar 90 a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>

158
00:09:56.131 --> 00:09:58.620
<v Speaker 1>which obviously is quite low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

159
00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:04.290
<v Speaker 1>so it's not a real transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's a real transformation.</v>

160
00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:09.000
<v Speaker 1>Some number had to be picked to</v>
<v Speaker 1>represent that absolute poverty.</v>

161
00:10:09.001 --> 00:10:14.001
<v Speaker 1>And I don't suspect the UN erred on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>side of capitalist over optimism.</v>

162
00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:19.500
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps they did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hundreds of thousands of people are</v>

163
00:10:19.501 --> 00:10:21.570
<v Speaker 1>being connected to the power grid every</v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

164
00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:24.900
<v Speaker 1>Fresh water's available,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to fewer and fewer people,</v>

165
00:10:24.901 --> 00:10:27.390
<v Speaker 1>but to more and more people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's happening extremely rapid,</v>

166
00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:31.140
<v Speaker 1>rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No starvation in India and China is a</v>

167
00:10:31.141 --> 00:10:33.780
<v Speaker 1>thing completely of the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never hear about that.</v>

168
00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:37.530
<v Speaker 1>And that's pretty much the case for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of the world except now.</v>

169
00:10:37.531 --> 00:10:41.040
<v Speaker 1>And then for political reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

170
00:10:41.041 --> 00:10:44.340
<v Speaker 1>everybody's got a cell phone or an oil</v>
<v Speaker 1>on anybody who doesn't,</v>

171
00:10:44.341 --> 00:10:46.080
<v Speaker 1>is going to have one in the next 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

172
00:10:46.081 --> 00:10:50.960
<v Speaker 1>And that puts in people's hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

173
00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:54.510
<v Speaker 1>a degree of communication and access</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would have been absolutely</v>

174
00:10:54.511 --> 00:10:58.770
<v Speaker 1>incomprehensible even 15 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

175
00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:03.640
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that the reason too that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I changed,</v>

176
00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:08.230
<v Speaker 1>it seemed to me that it was worthwhile</v>
<v Speaker 1>to change the way that I was using</v>

177
00:11:08.231 --> 00:11:11.410
<v Speaker 1>Twitter because all these good things</v>
<v Speaker 1>are happening</v>

178
00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:18.420
<v Speaker 1>and just concentrating on this</v>
<v Speaker 1>polarization process that seems to have</v>

179
00:11:18.951 --> 00:11:22.790
<v Speaker 1>gripped us in the West seems</v>
<v Speaker 1>counterproductive given all those good</v>

180
00:11:22.791 --> 00:11:24.380
<v Speaker 1>things that are going on in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>

181
00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:29.060
<v Speaker 1>Now that doesn't make what's going on in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the west with regards to political</v>

182
00:11:29.061 --> 00:11:31.220
<v Speaker 1>polarization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trivial,</v>

183
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:35.120
<v Speaker 1>but it does set it inside a much more</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive context.</v>

184
00:11:35.121 --> 00:11:36.680
<v Speaker 1>So that's something to keep in mind.</v>
