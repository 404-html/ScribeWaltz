00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:03.060
We know for example,

2
00:00:03.061 --> 00:00:07.590
that if you provide children with food and shelter and an adequate food and

3
00:00:07.591 --> 00:00:07.921
shelter,

4
00:00:07.921 --> 00:00:10.050
but you don't interact with them socially,

5
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.300
almost all of them die in the first year.

6
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:12.751
Right?

7
00:00:12.751 --> 00:00:13.860
It's not optional.

8
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.810
Touch is not optional for children.

9
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.940
Attention is not optional for children.

10
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.040
Play is not optional for children.

11
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.660
So it isn't just like,

12
00:00:21.661 --> 00:00:25.530
well the child comes into the world with a set of reflexes and can adapt to any

13
00:00:25.531 --> 00:00:29.280
old environments like know the environment has to be structured in a certain way

14
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:30.990
or the child will die.

15
00:00:30.991 --> 00:00:34.200
And it's very interesting when it comes to things like play and touch because

16
00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:36.570
you wouldn't think of those as fundamental necessities.

17
00:00:36.571 --> 00:00:36.811
Right?

18
00:00:36.811 --> 00:00:37.980
But it turns out that they are,

19
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.170
if you deprive a child badly enough of play and touch in the first three years

20
00:00:43.171 --> 00:00:43.800
of their life,

21
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.390
even if they survive,

22
00:00:45.391 --> 00:00:48.420
what comes out at the end of that is often something that's like barely

23
00:00:48.421 --> 00:00:52.590
recognizable as a functional human being and cannot be repaired after that

24
00:00:52.591 --> 00:00:53.424
point.

25
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.630
And that that experiment was done with Romanian orphans back in back in the 90s

26
00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:58.960
so it was a,

27
00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.020
it was an ugly situation to say the least.
