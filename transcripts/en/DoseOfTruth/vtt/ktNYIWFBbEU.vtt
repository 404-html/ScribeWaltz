1
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:12.783
<v Speaker 1>It fills you with,</v>

2
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.070
<v Speaker 1>see the scene when you look at the sun and the moon is that which is beyond,</v>

3
00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:19.303
<v Speaker 1>you</v>

4
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:31.530
<v Speaker 1>communicate with what's a small rise and so you offer something to the absolute</v>

5
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.510
<v Speaker 1>and it get a sense of the quality of your offering as a consequence of</v>

6
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:38.803
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

7
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:40.451
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

8
00:00:40.451 --> 00:00:42.830
<v Speaker 1>it's an archaic idea you can run as child,</v>

9
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:44.463
<v Speaker 1>child,</v>

10
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.313
<v Speaker 1>child life.</v>

11
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.970
<v Speaker 1>So you communicate with you talking sacrifice.</v>

12
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.440
<v Speaker 1>Katie sacrifices his offerings.</v>

13
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.240
<v Speaker 1>He will sacrifice his kids</v>

14
00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.980
<v Speaker 1>then because we're taking these three series,</v>

15
00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.520
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

16
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.353
<v Speaker 1>what's going on?</v>

17
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.750
<v Speaker 1>Well here's what's going on and this is how finding 12 rules for like as well.</v>

18
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.700
<v Speaker 1>It's all about 20 years to figure out.</v>

19
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.010
<v Speaker 1>What about this idea of sacrifice?</v>

20
00:01:09.011 --> 00:01:10.300
<v Speaker 1>What the Hell's behind that?</v>

21
00:01:10.301 --> 00:01:11.860
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's a human universal right here.</v>

22
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm sacrificial bone tt.</v>

23
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.871
<v Speaker 1>Everyone.</v>

24
00:01:13.871 --> 00:01:14.704
<v Speaker 1>We were,</v>

25
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:16.660
<v Speaker 1>well you can think,</v>

26
00:01:16.661 --> 00:01:17.410
<v Speaker 1>you can think it through.</v>

27
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.990
<v Speaker 1>If you think about how people use the word sacrifice in Monday morning,</v>

28
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:23.291
<v Speaker 1>who I teach,</v>

29
00:01:23.291 --> 00:01:26.650
<v Speaker 1>my students have university with Royal Children's,</v>

30
00:01:26.651 --> 00:01:27.790
<v Speaker 1>first generation immigrants.</v>

31
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.870
<v Speaker 1>So they're,</v>

32
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:29.081
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:01:29.081 --> 00:01:34.081
<v Speaker 1>their parents sacrificed the law in order to give them an opportunity.</v>

34
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.410
<v Speaker 1>So what did they sacrifice?</v>

35
00:01:35.411 --> 00:01:37.420
<v Speaker 1>But they offer the sacrifice to their home country.</v>

36
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.320
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they sacrifice a prevention because maybe they were doctors where they</v>

37
00:01:41.321 --> 00:01:41.711
<v Speaker 1>came from.</v>

38
00:01:41.711 --> 00:01:43.150
<v Speaker 1>The couldn't get licensed in Canada,</v>

39
00:01:43.151 --> 00:01:45.490
<v Speaker 1>so they ended up running a convenience store,</v>

40
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.780
<v Speaker 1>laundry or something like that.</v>

41
00:01:46.781 --> 00:01:47.560
<v Speaker 1>Working,</v>

42
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.393
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.220
<v Speaker 1>publishing house of their kids have an opportunity.</v>

44
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.830
<v Speaker 1>So if you ask the kids,</v>

45
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.480
<v Speaker 1>well what did your parents sacrificing that you could go to university?</v>

46
00:01:55.481 --> 00:01:56.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like their hands are not going away.</v>

47
00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.150
<v Speaker 1>I understand that language.</v>

48
00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.490
<v Speaker 1>And then you can ask them too.</v>

49
00:01:59.491 --> 00:01:59.571
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

50
00:01:59.571 --> 00:02:01.900
<v Speaker 1>what do you sacrifice for your grades?</v>

51
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:02.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

52
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't party every night before go ratification.</v>

53
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.930
<v Speaker 1>So what does it mean?</v>

54
00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.550
<v Speaker 1>I sacrificed something that though you'd need to make the future better.</v>

55
00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm acting out the proposition that I can borrow phage by giving them something.</v>

56
00:02:17.771 --> 00:02:20.080
<v Speaker 1>Now I can make something better in the future.</v>

57
00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.000
<v Speaker 1>Think that is an absolutely overwhelming discovery.</v>

58
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.290
<v Speaker 1>That's what human beings discovered is it's so strange because it works.</v>

59
00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.940
<v Speaker 1>You can read if I'm putting through the value in the present and it does pay off</v>

60
00:02:33.941 --> 00:02:34.774
<v Speaker 1>in the future.</v>

61
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.830
<v Speaker 1>Now that's partly because you're bargaining with future people and they're not</v>

62
00:02:38.831 --> 00:02:42.460
<v Speaker 1>going to encourage you that you can read more about how the 12 rules for life if</v>

63
00:02:42.461 --> 00:02:43.294
<v Speaker 1>you want.</v>

64
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.630
<v Speaker 1>The point is that it wasn't archaic at the ritual was Sikh people were acting up</v>

65
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.910
<v Speaker 1>something they didn't understand.</v>

66
00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.080
<v Speaker 1>They've watched how people that were successful were successful and they watched</v>

67
00:02:56.081 --> 00:03:00.850
<v Speaker 1>people how people who weren't successful one and they extract it out.</v>

68
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.150
<v Speaker 1>This idea that the people who were successful were doing something that made</v>

69
00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:07.150
<v Speaker 1>them successful and it was like sacrifice.</v>

70
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.350
<v Speaker 1>And so they ritualizing sacrifices have you understand what it was.</v>

71
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.930
<v Speaker 1>And eventually that became a psychological concept,</v>

72
00:03:13.931 --> 00:03:14.380
<v Speaker 1>which was,</v>

73
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.640
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

74
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.370
<v Speaker 1>you can give,</v>

75
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.203
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

76
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.760
<v Speaker 1>you do have,</v>

77
00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.820
<v Speaker 1>you have to renew yourself and the new year's fest,</v>

78
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.451
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

79
00:03:19.451 --> 00:03:21.790
<v Speaker 1>which is an unbelievably old idea,</v>

80
00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:25.900
<v Speaker 1>you give up your pathological past self and you make some,</v>

81
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.560
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

82
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.520
<v Speaker 1>when you call goals resolution,</v>

83
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:29.170
<v Speaker 1>a real issue,</v>

84
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.960
<v Speaker 1>it's about how you can be new in the future.</v>

85
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.860
<v Speaker 1>And that was a sacrificial act.</v>

86
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.790
<v Speaker 1>And it's based on a very old ritual that has roots,</v>

87
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.250
<v Speaker 1>at least in Mesopotamia at least 5,000 years ago where the king handed.</v>

88
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.590
<v Speaker 1>I do that every new year so that he can be a good king for the upcoming year,</v>

89
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.630
<v Speaker 1>which you can also read about that.</v>

90
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:50.070
<v Speaker 1>It maps.</v>

91
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.400
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you want to read about that.</v>

92
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:52.773
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

93
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:53.230
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

94
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.290
<v Speaker 1>the whole idea is that this whole sacrifice thing,</v>

95
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.180
<v Speaker 1>this actually works and they're not.</v>

96
00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.670
<v Speaker 1>That brings up a whole realm of Preston.</v>

97
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

98
00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.551
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

99
00:04:00.551 --> 00:04:01.870
<v Speaker 1>the sacrifices works.</v>

100
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.900
<v Speaker 1>What's the best possible sacrifice,</v>

101
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.441
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

102
00:04:05.441 --> 00:04:09.760
<v Speaker 1>Because that's obviously when you figured out that at work you want to figure</v>

103
00:04:09.761 --> 00:04:13.450
<v Speaker 1>out what would optimize it and part of that is you have to sacrifice that what</v>

104
00:04:13.451 --> 00:04:16.500
<v Speaker 1>you love and that's part of the active labor.</v>

105
00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.790
<v Speaker 1>When Abraham is called on to sacrifice,</v>

106
00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:19.091
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>

107
00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:20.550
<v Speaker 1>I can see versions of that idea.</v>

108
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:23.830
<v Speaker 1>Maybe what you love most as a person you love the most and you think,</v>

109
00:04:23.831 --> 00:04:24.730
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>

110
00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:27.460
<v Speaker 1>You said you offer your son up to God.</v>

111
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.360
<v Speaker 1>What you mean when you ask the question because the answer,</v>

112
00:04:30.361 --> 00:04:32.290
<v Speaker 1>that kind of stuff is actually yes.</v>

113
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.861
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

114
00:04:32.861 --> 00:04:37.140
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what you do if you're an ideal parent because you want your son</v>

115
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.410
<v Speaker 1>or your daughter to be as good as they can possibly be,</v>

116
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:43.180
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

117
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.330
<v Speaker 1>making the sacrifices that are necessary in order to carry them through life.</v>

118
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.070
<v Speaker 1>So even though the idea again is part Berrington are archaic and its ritual</v>

119
00:04:51.071 --> 00:04:51.670
<v Speaker 1>form,</v>

120
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.730
<v Speaker 1>there's the siege in that manner of incalculable.</v>

121
00:04:54.731 --> 00:04:55.510
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant.</v>

122
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:56.560
<v Speaker 1>In any case,</v>

123
00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.120
<v Speaker 1>God's happy with able to sacrifices and he's not happy with Katie suffices and</v>

124
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.910
<v Speaker 1>there's reality and there's not exactly what the swipe of the story,</v>

125
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.060
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of thing.</v>

126
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.190
<v Speaker 1>Not Exactly.</v>

127
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:11.741
<v Speaker 1>It's huge,</v>

128
00:05:11.741 --> 00:05:14.470
<v Speaker 1>but it's big and that's good because you know you don't look,</v>

129
00:05:14.471 --> 00:05:17.980
<v Speaker 1>life is like you're doing everything you can to sick yourself.</v>

130
00:05:17.981 --> 00:05:18.250
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

131
00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.220
<v Speaker 1>I could put the world in order around and it isn't working.</v>

132
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.730
<v Speaker 1>There's sacrifices are being rejected.</v>

133
00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.660
<v Speaker 1>What's the consequences of that?</v>

134
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.191
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

135
00:05:27.191 --> 00:05:28.270
<v Speaker 1>if you're not trying,</v>

136
00:05:28.271 --> 00:05:29.470
<v Speaker 1>when you fail,</v>

137
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.710
<v Speaker 1>well it sucks because it's not very exciting not to try and who the hell wants</v>

138
00:05:35.651 --> 00:05:36.101
<v Speaker 1>to fail,</v>

139
00:05:36.101 --> 00:05:40.390
<v Speaker 1>but at least you're not punish you for your best efforts.</v>

140
00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.720
<v Speaker 1>But if you made your sacrifices and they're rejected,</v>

141
00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:49.050
<v Speaker 1>then what's the right attitude towards up volcanoes out is to get bigger.</v>

142
00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.970
<v Speaker 1>He gets fitter because April is,</v>

143
00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:55.170
<v Speaker 1>you're taking these sacrifices.</v>

144
00:05:55.171 --> 00:05:58.490
<v Speaker 1>It works like mad now thrilled about Amy.</v>

145
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.520
<v Speaker 1>He's popular with forks increase,</v>

146
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:03.000
<v Speaker 1>everybody likes him worse.</v>

147
00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:04.760
<v Speaker 1>He's the sort of guy who deserves it.</v>

148
00:06:04.761 --> 00:06:06.020
<v Speaker 1>And that's super annoying,</v>

149
00:06:06.021 --> 00:06:06.291
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

150
00:06:06.291 --> 00:06:10.100
<v Speaker 1>Because there's nothing more annoying and coming to meet someone hyper</v>

151
00:06:10.101 --> 00:06:13.130
<v Speaker 1>successful and then also realizing that they deserve it.</v>

152
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.790
<v Speaker 1>You think that person would have to have good graces to be contemptible so you</v>

153
00:06:16.791 --> 00:06:19.850
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't have to be envious about the fact that everything is going well for</v>

154
00:06:19.851 --> 00:06:20.360
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

155
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.580
<v Speaker 1>But often that doesn't work out.</v>

156
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.210
<v Speaker 1>So [inaudible] you raged by nick spice,</v>

157
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:31.300
<v Speaker 1>continual failure and he's outraged at April because April's successes casting</v>

158
00:06:32.331 --> 00:06:36.200
<v Speaker 1>to stay there and even a more dim light and he's burning about the,</v>

159
00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:36.870
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

160
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:37.560
<v Speaker 1>the justice,</v>

161
00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.950
<v Speaker 1>the injustice in the world.</v>

162
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:44.300
<v Speaker 1>And so he decides to call out God because how to get it,</v>

163
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.530
<v Speaker 1>why not chain?</v>

164
00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.790
<v Speaker 1>And so he has the little chocolates God and says something along the lines.</v>

165
00:06:49.791 --> 00:06:52.730
<v Speaker 1>I've cried a lot of different translations of this interchange.</v>

166
00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:54.950
<v Speaker 1>Just good to what was at the bottom of it.</v>

167
00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:56.600
<v Speaker 1>It's quite complicated,</v>

168
00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:01.190
<v Speaker 1>but basically what happens is Katie calls out God the creator of reality.</v>

169
00:07:01.191 --> 00:07:02.540
<v Speaker 1>He says something like,</v>

170
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.520
<v Speaker 1>what the hell is up here?</v>

171
00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:10.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm breaking myself in half trying to have a half decent life.</v>

172
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.340
<v Speaker 1>Everything I do,</v>

173
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:18.400
<v Speaker 1>just it's turns to ash and then there's my brother whose doesn't seem to be</v>

174
00:07:20.121 --> 00:07:23.690
<v Speaker 1>making sacrifices or any more heartfelt than me.</v>

175
00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:25.430
<v Speaker 1>He's a spectacular success.</v>

176
00:07:25.431 --> 00:07:26.000
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

177
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.230
<v Speaker 1>what the hell is going on?</v>

178
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:29.230
<v Speaker 1>Kinda crazy planet is this anyway,</v>

179
00:07:29.231 --> 00:07:32.980
<v Speaker 1>so that you've created where this sort of thing is so likely to happen,</v>

180
00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:37.640
<v Speaker 1>but you know you might first of all told to that the probability that you</v>

181
00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:42.770
<v Speaker 1>thought that way in your life from time to time is 100% in fact,</v>

182
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:46.970
<v Speaker 1>I suspect that there's a substantial number of you in the room who think like</v>

183
00:07:46.971 --> 00:07:48.560
<v Speaker 1>that almost all the time.</v>

184
00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:52.540
<v Speaker 1>It's extraordinary tempting because when things fall apart for you,</v>

185
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:54.140
<v Speaker 1>which they do from time to time,</v>

186
00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:54.680
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

187
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:54.951
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

188
00:07:54.951 --> 00:07:58.940
<v Speaker 1>who doesn't want to go onsite and shake his fist at the sky and rail against the</v>

189
00:07:58.941 --> 00:08:00.740
<v Speaker 1>horror of running fig?</v>

190
00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.071
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

191
00:08:01.071 --> 00:08:04.850
<v Speaker 1>The question arises like how can the rule be constituted in such an unjust</v>

192
00:08:04.851 --> 00:08:06.770
<v Speaker 1>manner and who's to blame?</v>

193
00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:07.251
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>

194
00:08:07.251 --> 00:08:07.401
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

195
00:08:07.401 --> 00:08:08.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe in God,</v>

196
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:09.340
<v Speaker 1>it's him.</v>

197
00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:10.280
<v Speaker 1>It's irrelevant.</v>

198
00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:14.540
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter from the psychological perspective it happens anyways.</v>

199
00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:16.280
<v Speaker 1>You act it out anyways.</v>

200
00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:19.490
<v Speaker 1>Also God listens but he's not,</v>

201
00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:20.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

202
00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:21.830
<v Speaker 1>taking responsibility because,</v>

203
00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:28.430
<v Speaker 1>because he thinks it's king fall and so this is what he tells cake essentially.</v>

204
00:08:28.431 --> 00:08:31.340
<v Speaker 1>He says it's a very interesting use of language.</v>

205
00:08:31.341 --> 00:08:35.150
<v Speaker 1>He says sin coaches since by the way,</v>

206
00:08:35.151 --> 00:08:39.290
<v Speaker 1>that we're needs to draw your Arrow back and to miss the target.</v>

207
00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:41.950
<v Speaker 1>It's a very particular kind of word.</v>

208
00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:45.440
<v Speaker 1>It needs to miss what you're in rehab or perhaps not aiming at all.</v>

209
00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:47.430
<v Speaker 1>So it applies that perhaps Ramey,</v>

210
00:08:47.431 --> 00:08:52.000
<v Speaker 1>Amy wrong if you don't get the target right and you specify the targets.</v>

211
00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:54.620
<v Speaker 1>And that's an interesting part of that as well.</v>

212
00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.320
<v Speaker 1>So is it the case sin crouches at your door?</v>

213
00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:02.400
<v Speaker 1>Like that predatory sexually aroused cap,</v>

214
00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:05.970
<v Speaker 1>you have been invited into your life,</v>

215
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:11.420
<v Speaker 1>you've opened the door to it and you voluntarily had your way with it.</v>

216
00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:13.460
<v Speaker 1>And it being that in a sexual manner,</v>

217
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:17.100
<v Speaker 1>sort of like the old idea that a vampire can't come into your house on us,</v>

218
00:09:17.101 --> 00:09:18.210
<v Speaker 1>you would find it in.</v>

219
00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:19.201
<v Speaker 1>So first of all,</v>

220
00:09:19.201 --> 00:09:20.400
<v Speaker 1>he tells Kane,</v>

221
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:25.470
<v Speaker 1>don't be so sure that it's the structure of reality that's at fault here.</v>

222
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.850
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's something that you're either doing or not doing and he accuses of</v>

223
00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:32.910
<v Speaker 1>directing says not only are you not giving it,</v>

224
00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:33.930
<v Speaker 1>you're also doing it.</v>

225
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:35.870
<v Speaker 1>There's something there that tiller king gets.</v>

226
00:09:35.871 --> 00:09:36.041
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

227
00:09:36.041 --> 00:09:36.874
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>

228
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.520
<v Speaker 1>You've asked him to come in.</v>

229
00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:40.280
<v Speaker 1>No way have you asked him to command.</v>

230
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:45.350
<v Speaker 1>You've made it with it in a creative manner and you've given birth to something</v>

231
00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:48.690
<v Speaker 1>horrible as a consequence and have know it.</v>

232
00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:52.860
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what happens with the mess with God.</v>

233
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.140
<v Speaker 1>You find out things that you don't want to find out.</v>

234
00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:59.280
<v Speaker 1>And so painting was not very happy when he started this discussion.</v>

235
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.500
<v Speaker 1>And when he's done with the discussion,</v>

236
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.270
<v Speaker 1>he's seriously not happy.</v>

237
00:10:03.271 --> 00:10:05.630
<v Speaker 1>And the story says his countenance fail,</v>

238
00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:10.140
<v Speaker 1>which means that he was enraged by that answer.</v>

239
00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:13.290
<v Speaker 1>And no wonder because he's got the problem that he had before,</v>

240
00:10:13.291 --> 00:10:15.270
<v Speaker 1>which is that everything's going to hell around him.</v>

241
00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.860
<v Speaker 1>And his brother was a thriving plus go on himself,</v>

242
00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.440
<v Speaker 1>just told him that it's completely his fault and that he knows he's doing it.</v>

243
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:23.670
<v Speaker 1>And then he chose to do it.</v>

244
00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:25.043
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

245
00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:26.280
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>

246
00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.980
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do in a situation like that?</v>

247
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:29.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

248
00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:31.110
<v Speaker 1>you do what people do.</v>

249
00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:35.220
<v Speaker 1>You take a rock and you killed your brother,</v>

250
00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:37.013
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

251
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.370
<v Speaker 1>And that's what happens.</v>

252
00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:39.260
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

253
00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:43.090
<v Speaker 1>and it's a horrifying story because it's really the first story about the,</v>

254
00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:48.420
<v Speaker 1>and it's a story of an annuity and hatred and murder and worse,</v>

255
00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:54.470
<v Speaker 1>because what happens then is Katie is spared by God for complex reasons that we</v>

256
00:10:54.781 --> 00:10:55.614
<v Speaker 1>won't get into.</v>

257
00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:58.770
<v Speaker 1>And then he goes out and has a family and he has his descendants.</v>

258
00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.620
<v Speaker 1>And what is the sentence is tubal cave.</v>

259
00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:04.890
<v Speaker 1>And [inaudible] is the first person who makes weapons of war.</v>

260
00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:09.500
<v Speaker 1>So there's this idea that the corruption of the individual that was represented</v>

261
00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:11.760
<v Speaker 1>by Kane is part of the process.</v>

262
00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:14.550
<v Speaker 1>So there's more to that.</v>

263
00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:15.983
<v Speaker 1>So if you,</v>

264
00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:17.513
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

265
00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:18.450
<v Speaker 1>it's so pain,</v>

266
00:11:18.451 --> 00:11:23.451
<v Speaker 1>let's say kills you if you and so child and [inaudible] child til seven of you</v>

267
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:26.580
<v Speaker 1>and if you insult Keynes,</v>

268
00:11:26.581 --> 00:11:27.480
<v Speaker 1>Graham Charlatan,</v>

269
00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:29.680
<v Speaker 1>he kills 49 to two.</v>

270
00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:33.910
<v Speaker 1>So there's this idea that this corrupt process that came part took him,</v>

271
00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:35.430
<v Speaker 1>expands exponentially.</v>

272
00:11:35.431 --> 00:11:37.620
<v Speaker 1>I'll do to the community page.</v>

273
00:11:37.621 --> 00:11:41.000
<v Speaker 1>Potential descendant is to locate who makes weapons war,</v>

274
00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:42.181
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

275
00:11:42.181 --> 00:11:47.181
<v Speaker 1>So does this direct blind Henry story between the Pauling vengeful nature of</v>

276
00:11:48.331 --> 00:11:53.331
<v Speaker 1>cane and his jealousy and spite and refusal to take responsibility for the of</v>

277
00:11:53.501 --> 00:11:58.390
<v Speaker 1>his actions and inactions murder and genocide and it's all in like one</v>

278
00:11:58.391 --> 00:11:59.224
<v Speaker 1>paragraph.</v>

279
00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:00.820
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely overwhelming.</v>

280
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:05.440
<v Speaker 1>Back to the high school she would use,</v>

281
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:08.950
<v Speaker 1>they're just acting out exactly the same old story.</v>

282
00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.610
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing over and over.</v>

283
00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:13.380
<v Speaker 1>That's why these stories are typical.</v>

284
00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:18.220
<v Speaker 1>It's why we can never forget them and they always happen and hopefully we can</v>

285
00:12:18.221 --> 00:12:19.590
<v Speaker 1>come to understanding.</v>

286
00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:23.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to have some possibility of avoiding the worst of the</v>

287
00:12:23.711 --> 00:12:24.580
<v Speaker 1>catastrophes.</v>

288
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:26.770
<v Speaker 1>High school shooters,</v>

289
00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:28.690
<v Speaker 1>people like to call them my kids.</v>

290
00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:33.460
<v Speaker 1>They wrote down what they did know as far as they were concerned.</v>

291
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.130
<v Speaker 1>They were rejected at least in part.</v>

292
00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:36.731
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

293
00:12:36.731 --> 00:12:39.880
<v Speaker 1>people make much of that same well the poor kids who were bullied and that's</v>

294
00:12:39.881 --> 00:12:40.870
<v Speaker 1>what they do for vantage.</v>

295
00:12:40.871 --> 00:12:43.930
<v Speaker 1>It's like first of all and working stuff that kids,</v>

296
00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:45.160
<v Speaker 1>second of all,</v>

297
00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:50.020
<v Speaker 1>most people are voting and they don't feel want to blog to high school and it</v>

298
00:12:50.021 --> 00:12:51.070
<v Speaker 1>wasn't just that they call them.</v>

299
00:12:51.071 --> 00:12:53.740
<v Speaker 1>My kids wanted to go in there and kill.</v>

300
00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:57.370
<v Speaker 1>That was only a tiny fraction of what they were planning in their fantasies.</v>

301
00:12:57.371 --> 00:12:59.230
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to take out the whole city,</v>

302
00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:00.250
<v Speaker 1>the entire city.</v>

303
00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.320
<v Speaker 1>They have propane bones plans.</v>

304
00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:06.430
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to make a media spectacle it management quick attractively.</v>

305
00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:10.270
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to produce as much mayhem as they possibly could in the shortest</v>

306
00:13:10.271 --> 00:13:15.271
<v Speaker 1>possible period of time and cap it off their own suicide just to demonstrate how</v>

307
00:13:15.491 --> 00:13:17.470
<v Speaker 1>little they character the damn world.</v>

308
00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:20.710
<v Speaker 1>And that's the motivation behind that sort of thing.</v>

309
00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.080
<v Speaker 1>It's a deep and dark motivation.</v>
