1
00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.650
<v Speaker 1>Kids</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that doesn't necessarily sound very</v>

2
00:00:20.531 --> 00:00:22.810
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just</v>

3
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.330
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

4
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.340
<v Speaker 1>is actually a microcosm of world just</v>
<v Speaker 1>like any play.</v>

5
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.460
<v Speaker 1>Normally</v>
<v Speaker 1>the microcosm of normals are capitalism</v>

6
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.280
<v Speaker 1>and say you've been learning people</v>
<v Speaker 1>about like playing because even though</v>

7
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.210
<v Speaker 1>it's the board is real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people with real emotions that will be</v>

8
00:00:54.671 --> 00:00:58.810
<v Speaker 1>relevant in real</v>
<v Speaker 1>until you can see what their funding,</v>

9
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.200
<v Speaker 1>if they're funding play in</v>
<v Speaker 1>winning,</v>

10
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.050
<v Speaker 1>he attributes</v>
<v Speaker 1>it detached themselves from a little bit</v>

11
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.010
<v Speaker 1>so that it's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

12
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.340
<v Speaker 1>remember that it's like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated things.</v>

13
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.320
<v Speaker 1>It's fundamental a rate by testing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>play with your testing,</v>

14
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.210
<v Speaker 1>how well they match was and so that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kids do.</v>

15
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.580
<v Speaker 1>Play Games with their friends too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more complicated because those</v>

16
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.960
<v Speaker 1>games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're pretending.</v>

17
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.710
<v Speaker 1>So let's say kids freaking excited,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to play house.</v>

18
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.840
<v Speaker 1>This is a common kits and pavement first</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that it was negotiation,</v>

19
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.500
<v Speaker 1>so screenwriters and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will you be the mom that you need the</v>

20
00:01:48.601 --> 00:01:49.310
<v Speaker 1>data?</v>

21
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be the cat and then if everyone</v>

22
00:01:52.291 --> 00:01:56.400
<v Speaker 1>wants to play that role,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the first thing the kids</v>

23
00:01:56.401 --> 00:01:58.100
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the kids have to one play</v>

24
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.650
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's a good thing to keep in mind.</v>

25
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.320
<v Speaker 1>Everybody accepts the goal and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>might say,</v>

26
00:02:04.321 --> 00:02:08.010
<v Speaker 1>well then they go and imitate the mother</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the father and the cap,</v>

27
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.940
<v Speaker 1>but they don't actually imitate them</v>
<v Speaker 1>because like if I was entertaining,</v>

28
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.960
<v Speaker 1>you would move exactly the same way you</v>
<v Speaker 1>will,</v>

29
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.590
<v Speaker 1>but if I was caricatured review,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say I got to know you a little</v>

30
00:02:19.591 --> 00:02:21.450
<v Speaker 1>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I can kind of adopt the spirit of</v>

31
00:02:21.451 --> 00:02:24.000
<v Speaker 1>your voice and your mannerisms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever they are,</v>

32
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.380
<v Speaker 1>I could extract from you a pattern of</v>
<v Speaker 1>church artist doing.</v>

33
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.890
<v Speaker 1>I could avoid that pattern on some long</v>
<v Speaker 1>more sophisticated interest invitation</v>

34
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.650
<v Speaker 1>and that's what the kids are trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do when they play house and I'm</v>

35
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.910
<v Speaker 1>indicating their father because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't doing exactly the same movements</v>

36
00:02:38.911 --> 00:02:40.440
<v Speaker 1>that the father was doing.</v>

37
00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.640
<v Speaker 1>They've watched the quad that need the</v>
<v Speaker 1>father over multiple contexts and</v>

38
00:02:44.641 --> 00:02:49.641
<v Speaker 1>they've extracted on the commonalities</v>
<v Speaker 1>across those contexts and portrayed that</v>

39
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.160
<v Speaker 1>with the term terms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can think about that as a spirit.</v>

40
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.450
<v Speaker 1>It's the spirit of that being the</v>
<v Speaker 1>partner across multiple contexts and</v>

41
00:02:57.451 --> 00:03:02.451
<v Speaker 1>then they're acting that representing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>play and so they can say what they're</v>

42
00:03:04.421 --> 00:03:06.490
<v Speaker 1>doing and they can't tell them what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rules are,</v>

43
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.540
<v Speaker 1>but they can use their own body to</v>
<v Speaker 1>represent this incredibly complex thing</v>

44
00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:13.430
<v Speaker 1>that they don't understand and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>could do the same thing with mother.</v>

45
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.480
<v Speaker 1>They can play with a goal and feed it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and do all those things,</v>

46
00:03:16.481 --> 00:03:18.840
<v Speaker 1>but the mother doesn't can practice</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a mother,</v>

47
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.870
<v Speaker 1>so they learn how to do this ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Describe it.</v>

48
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.390
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of things that we knew</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that and so we know how to act out</v>

49
00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.820
<v Speaker 1>things that you don't understand it now.</v>

50
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.160
<v Speaker 1>Eventually we figured out collectively</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the 10 years you've been trying to</v>

51
00:03:39.281 --> 00:03:42.150
<v Speaker 1>figure things out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to act in a manner that makes us</v>

52
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.280
<v Speaker 1>essentially civilized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilized.</v>

53
00:03:45.281 --> 00:03:49.120
<v Speaker 1>That enables us to sit in this group</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though we don't know each other and</v>

54
00:03:49.121 --> 00:03:53.380
<v Speaker 1>to all the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to all the same posture and to all about</v>

55
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.270
<v Speaker 1>essentially the same attitude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nsap,</v>

56
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.510
<v Speaker 1>emotional state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to thereby being predictable to one</v>

57
00:03:58.511 --> 00:04:02.410
<v Speaker 1>another and to be safe with one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what we're doing right now.</v>

58
00:04:02.411 --> 00:04:05.350
<v Speaker 1>It's a ritual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone understands it's a theatrical</v>

59
00:04:05.351 --> 00:04:09.850
<v Speaker 1>Richard that everyone understands and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that everyone is doing the same</v>

60
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.600
<v Speaker 1>thing means that we can all be virtually</v>
<v Speaker 1>assured that at the moment we're all</v>

61
00:04:13.601 --> 00:04:17.950
<v Speaker 1>holding the same ideal and that's why</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not terrified because if someone,</v>

62
00:04:17.951 --> 00:04:19.960
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden I stood up and branch to</v>
<v Speaker 1>90 nineties,</v>

63
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.480
<v Speaker 1>this was not be the same place.</v>

64
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.780
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was seriously,</v>

65
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.340
<v Speaker 1>you don't want the same place and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be using the same part of your</v>

66
00:04:27.341 --> 00:04:30.900
<v Speaker 1>brain to process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would switch instantly and you'd be</v>

67
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.150
<v Speaker 1>possessed by ancient motivational</v>
<v Speaker 1>states,</v>

68
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.810
<v Speaker 1>terror and rage and the preparation for</v>
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>

69
00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:42.160
<v Speaker 1>That would be completely outside of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>neurological systems that you're using</v>

70
00:04:42.161 --> 00:04:46.150
<v Speaker 1>to orient yourself at this moment and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people do not like it.</v>

71
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.720
<v Speaker 1>When that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't like even if someone,</v>

72
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.690
<v Speaker 1>you know what that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're walking down the street and</v>

73
00:04:52.691 --> 00:04:56.920
<v Speaker 1>you see someone who's doing something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that isn't normal,</v>

74
00:04:56.921 --> 00:04:59.560
<v Speaker 1>like maybe they're muttering to</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves preaching a little bit or</v>

75
00:04:59.561 --> 00:05:01.900
<v Speaker 1>something like that and they're a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>disheveled,</v>

76
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.820
<v Speaker 1>you'll do what almost everyone does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is we'll give them a wide berth</v>

77
00:05:06.821 --> 00:05:11.170
<v Speaker 1>and you'll keep on walking and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably do what you can not to make eye</v>

78
00:05:11.171 --> 00:05:14.680
<v Speaker 1>contact because that's an invitation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're,</v>

79
00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:15.100
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>

80
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.690
<v Speaker 1>You walk down the street and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

81
00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:20.500
<v Speaker 1>there's some unexplored territory</v>
<v Speaker 1>circumvented that,</v>

82
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.560
<v Speaker 1>and then you continue on so everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can as a consequence of your options</v>

83
00:05:25.811 --> 00:05:30.520
<v Speaker 1>to stop yourself from being exposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that disrupts the stability of</v>

84
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.970
<v Speaker 1>the theory that you're using to</v>
<v Speaker 1>orientate yourself in the world.</v>

85
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.070
<v Speaker 1>That's why people hold onto their</v>
<v Speaker 1>theories because underneath that is like</v>

86
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.640
<v Speaker 1>terror rage and you don't want that</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming up and so we don't take it</v>

87
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.790
<v Speaker 1>kindly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People come along and masks are the</v>

88
00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:49.270
<v Speaker 1>axioms of our theories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We seriously look like that and that's</v>

89
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.690
<v Speaker 1>partly why people are so motivated to</v>
<v Speaker 1>protect their belief systems.</v>

90
00:05:52.691 --> 00:05:55.120
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not only that we construe the world</v>

91
00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:58.460
<v Speaker 1>with our belief systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we organize our social behavior,</v>

92
00:05:58.461 --> 00:06:00.920
<v Speaker 1>we started building systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so if you mess with the belief</v>

93
00:06:00.921 --> 00:06:03.560
<v Speaker 1>systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mess with the structure that makes</v>

94
00:06:03.561 --> 00:06:05.900
<v Speaker 1>everyone predictable to everyone else.</v>

95
00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:10.370
<v Speaker 1>And that is not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing been down that path,</v>

96
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.080
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

97
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:17.200
<v Speaker 1>so now</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've learned how to act out this</v>

98
00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:20.990
<v Speaker 1>pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes us acceptable and desirable</v>

99
00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:25.940
<v Speaker 1>project and we're constantly reminding</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other how to do that because like</v>

100
00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.830
<v Speaker 1>if you go to a party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna want people who knows when</v>

101
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.480
<v Speaker 1>you walk by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're the typical person,</v>

102
00:06:32.481 --> 00:06:34.700
<v Speaker 1>a typical reasonably well socialized</v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

103
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.340
<v Speaker 1>you're going to want people to like you</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than they dislike what you're going</v>

104
00:06:38.341 --> 00:06:42.200
<v Speaker 1>to want to pay some attention to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to want to engage people in</v>

105
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.260
<v Speaker 1>interesting conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're going to want people to</v>

106
00:06:45.261 --> 00:06:49.780
<v Speaker 1>appreciate you and you know if you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have a good time to have a good time</v>

107
00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:54.380
<v Speaker 1>party needs to act in a certain way that</v>
<v Speaker 1>elicits a certain set of responses from</v>

108
00:06:54.381 --> 00:06:56.300
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you fail it,</v>

109
00:06:56.301 --> 00:06:59.630
<v Speaker 1>that they will tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll ignore you,</v>

110
00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.320
<v Speaker 1>they won't laugh at your jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know they'll move away from you.</v>

111
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:06.480
<v Speaker 1>There's all sorts of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all sorts of things they will do</v>

112
00:07:06.481 --> 00:07:10.010
<v Speaker 1>to broadcast at you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your deviation from the ideal.</v>

113
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:12.180
<v Speaker 1>And that can be very painful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

114
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.370
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you're very deviant from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ideal because it opens up this</v>

115
00:07:16.371 --> 00:07:19.670
<v Speaker 1>realization that you just don't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they hell you're doing at all,</v>

116
00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.380
<v Speaker 1>and that either means that other people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are contemptible and horrible and</v>

117
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:26.990
<v Speaker 1>something should be done about that or</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's something seriously wrong</v>

118
00:07:26.991 --> 00:07:30.440
<v Speaker 1>with you that needs to be rectified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And neither of those options are very</v>

119
00:07:30.441 --> 00:07:34.050
<v Speaker 1>pleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we carry within us,</v>

120
00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:37.210
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>implicit ideal that we carry within us.</v>

121
00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:39.890
<v Speaker 1>A counter idea as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The opposite of that.</v>

122
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.630
<v Speaker 1>That's an introduction in some sense to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the landscape of good and evil because</v>

123
00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:48.790
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate ideal is whatever is good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the ultimate counter ideal is</v>

124
00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:53.270
<v Speaker 1>whatever's evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the space within which we map</v>

125
00:07:53.271 --> 00:07:58.271
<v Speaker 1>our behaviors and we can't help but map</v>
<v Speaker 1>out that space because it's.</v>

126
00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:02.120
<v Speaker 1>It constitutes the most extreme version</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this structure that we use to</v>

127
00:08:02.121 --> 00:08:05.060
<v Speaker 1>evaluate everything everyone else does</v>
<v Speaker 1>in everything we do.</v>

128
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:09.230
<v Speaker 1>We also know that that's the case</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when you go to a movie,</v>

129
00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.110
<v Speaker 1>even though you don't know that you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the case,</v>

130
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.680
<v Speaker 1>you go to a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say it's an action group or it</v>

131
00:08:15.681 --> 00:08:17.180
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be a roadmap.</v>

132
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:20.000
<v Speaker 1>Maybe those are the two basic categories</v>
<v Speaker 1>of foods.</v>

133
00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:25.610
<v Speaker 1>Naturally he has a hero if you're is</v>
<v Speaker 1>either greg or partially do like a</v>

134
00:08:25.611 --> 00:08:28.880
<v Speaker 1>complex here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in kind of a flawed and interesting</v>

135
00:08:28.881 --> 00:08:29.714
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

136
00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:34.340
<v Speaker 1>And then of course in an action movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the evil bad guy as well,</v>

137
00:08:34.341 --> 00:08:37.640
<v Speaker 1>but hopefully he's not good enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise it's a caricatures,</v>

138
00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:42.690
<v Speaker 1>but always into movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have that hero and the villain and</v>

139
00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:46.890
<v Speaker 1>the intermodal maxwell that you have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>person who's the love interest in all</v>

140
00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.830
<v Speaker 1>those who've failed to measure up.</v>

141
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.370
<v Speaker 1>And so it's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just played out for different</v>

142
00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:56.170
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know it's,</v>

143
00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:59.300
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult to understand that if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to see your movie,</v>

144
00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:03.570
<v Speaker 1>which is fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't real,</v>

145
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:08.880
<v Speaker 1>then it's also more real than real</v>
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise you either watching</v>

146
00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:12.690
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want the movie director to</v>

147
00:09:12.691 --> 00:09:17.370
<v Speaker 1>show you how many times the protagonists</v>
<v Speaker 1>links before they get out of bed in the</v>

148
00:09:17.371 --> 00:09:20.310
<v Speaker 1>morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not interesting when you want them</v>

149
00:09:20.311 --> 00:09:25.311
<v Speaker 1>to do is to take the full panoply of</v>
<v Speaker 1>here with behavior and only extract from</v>

150
00:09:27.121 --> 00:09:31.560
<v Speaker 1>it those instances that are particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>interest in relationship to the</v>

151
00:09:31.561 --> 00:09:34.280
<v Speaker 1>portrayal of that ideal or the counter</v>
<v Speaker 1>id.</v>

152
00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:37.980
<v Speaker 1>You want to see why they're bad guys bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you want to see why the group guys</v>

153
00:09:37.981 --> 00:09:42.660
<v Speaker 1>good and that's more real than reality</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's abstracted from reality.</v>

154
00:09:42.661 --> 00:09:45.960
<v Speaker 1>It's more real than reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like numbers are more real than the</v>

155
00:09:45.961 --> 00:09:48.630
<v Speaker 1>things that are derived from some form</v>
<v Speaker 1>of abstraction.</v>

156
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:50.050
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't.</v>

157
00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:54.060
<v Speaker 1>It makes perfect sense that when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to extract from fictional</v>

158
00:09:54.061 --> 00:09:56.550
<v Speaker 1>representations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's represent representations of</v>

159
00:09:56.551 --> 00:09:59.520
<v Speaker 1>what's good and what's evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that in principle,</v>

160
00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:03.930
<v Speaker 1>assuming that this is what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could do a better job of embodying</v>

161
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.130
<v Speaker 1>what's good because then everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>would go well for you in the world</v>

162
00:10:07.131 --> 00:10:08.790
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assuming that that's what you want,</v>

163
00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:12.780
<v Speaker 1>so there's probably nothing more</v>
<v Speaker 1>important than you could possibly do</v>

164
00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:14.310
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No do that,</v>

165
00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:17.160
<v Speaker 1>and that's why you treat it like it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>more important than anything else.</v>

166
00:10:17.161 --> 00:10:19.320
<v Speaker 1>You can do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think about it,</v>

167
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:23.790
<v Speaker 1>you will go to a movie and you'll line</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and you pay to be exposed to that</v>

168
00:10:23.791 --> 00:10:28.140
<v Speaker 1>kind of information and that's an.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an indication of exactly how it</v>

169
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:28.770
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

170
00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:31.740
<v Speaker 1>You actually find most of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if it isn't movies slogan,</v>

171
00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:35.530
<v Speaker 1>it's it's fiction or or stories that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people tell you,</v>

172
00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:38.880
<v Speaker 1>no interest whatsoever in people and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's very rare.</v>

173
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:41.790
<v Speaker 1>If even if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll find that science fiction or</v>

174
00:10:41.791 --> 00:10:45.120
<v Speaker 1>something else like that where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mythology creeps into the technology</v>

175
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:47.640
<v Speaker 1>doesn't really matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to come at you one way or</v>

176
00:10:47.641 --> 00:10:52.590
<v Speaker 1>another and the fact that you will pay</v>
<v Speaker 1>to expose yourself to that and then also</v>

177
00:10:52.591 --> 00:10:57.510
<v Speaker 1>that when you go into those venues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be entranced by it despite yourself,</v>

178
00:10:57.511 --> 00:10:59.730
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is real,</v>

179
00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:03.600
<v Speaker 1>is an indication of exactly how</v>
<v Speaker 1>important that information is.</v>
