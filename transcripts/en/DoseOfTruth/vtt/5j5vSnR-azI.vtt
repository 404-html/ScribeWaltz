1
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.960
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the Pharaoh was pretty impressed by</v>

2
00:00:08.961 --> 00:00:11.060
<v Speaker 1>this dream interpretation and pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>worried about it.</v>

3
00:00:11.061 --> 00:00:14.150
<v Speaker 1>And I guess he's a reasonable person</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that he put Joseph in</v>

4
00:00:14.151 --> 00:00:15.300
<v Speaker 1>jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.990
<v Speaker 1>I guess he didn't have much choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now therefore let Pharaoh look for a man</v>

6
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.230
<v Speaker 1>discreet and wise and set him over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>land of Egypt.</v>

7
00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.410
<v Speaker 1>Let Pharaoh do this and let him appoint</v>
<v Speaker 1>officers over the loud.</v>

8
00:00:26.411 --> 00:00:29.680
<v Speaker 1>This is what Joseph is saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and take up the fifth part of the land</v>

9
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.070
<v Speaker 1>of Egypt in the seven plenteous years</v>
<v Speaker 1>and let them gather all the food of</v>

10
00:00:36.731 --> 00:00:39.820
<v Speaker 1>those good years that come and lay up</v>
<v Speaker 1>corn under the hand of Pharaoh and let</v>

11
00:00:39.821 --> 00:00:44.821
<v Speaker 1>them keep food in the cities</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just like that Joseph has restored</v>

12
00:00:45.331 --> 00:00:49.990
<v Speaker 1>to his position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Pharaoh said unto Joseph,</v>

13
00:00:49.991 --> 00:00:53.830
<v Speaker 1>I am Pharaoh and without these shall no</v>
<v Speaker 1>man lift up his hand or foot in all of</v>

14
00:00:53.831 --> 00:00:54.580
<v Speaker 1>the land of Egypt.</v>

15
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.350
<v Speaker 1>And so he comes out of the prison and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

16
00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.240
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I'm concerned,</v>

17
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.080
<v Speaker 1>he actually occupies a position that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher than the position of the Pharaoh.</v>

18
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.960
<v Speaker 1>It depends on how you look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the Pharaoh is relegated himself</v>

19
00:01:07.961 --> 00:01:10.150
<v Speaker 1>to ceremonial status,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

20
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.970
<v Speaker 1>Joseph has all the responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes all the decisions.</v>

21
00:01:12.971 --> 00:01:17.971
<v Speaker 1>So defacto he's the Pharaoh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't get the glory precisely,</v>

22
00:01:18.101 --> 00:01:19.840
<v Speaker 1>although he's not doing too bad for</v>
<v Speaker 1>himself,</v>

23
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.730
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lesson in that too.</v>

24
00:01:21.731 --> 00:01:25.540
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote these rules for Quora a long</v>

25
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.240
<v Speaker 1>time ago and one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have written them into this,</v>

26
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.940
<v Speaker 1>some of them into this book you guys go</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a pamphlet about today.</v>

27
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.040
<v Speaker 1>One of the rules that I didn't write</v>
<v Speaker 1>about was</v>

28
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.980
<v Speaker 1>note that responsive note,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that opportunity lurks where</v>

29
00:01:37.981 --> 00:01:41.910
<v Speaker 1>responsibility has been abdicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really interesting,</v>

30
00:01:41.911 --> 00:01:43.020
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

31
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.570
<v Speaker 1>I've seen people in their jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say things like,</v>

32
00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:46.370
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

33
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.240
<v Speaker 1>the guy I work with doesn't do any work.</v>

34
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.741
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

35
00:01:49.741 --> 00:01:51.580
<v Speaker 1>you could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

36
00:01:51.581 --> 00:01:54.850
<v Speaker 1>I know there's limits to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things you can do at work</v>

37
00:01:54.851 --> 00:01:56.980
<v Speaker 1>is make yourself indispensable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

38
00:01:56.981 --> 00:02:00.700
<v Speaker 1>you might get the cane types against you</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do that,</v>

39
00:02:00.701 --> 00:02:04.240
<v Speaker 1>but there's something to be said for</v>
<v Speaker 1>being indispensable because when people</v>

40
00:02:04.241 --> 00:02:08.140
<v Speaker 1>start to be dispensed with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've probably won't be one of them.</v>

41
00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.110
<v Speaker 1>Or even if you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the fact that you're indispensable</v>

42
00:02:11.111 --> 00:02:13.300
<v Speaker 1>just means you can go somewhere else and</v>
<v Speaker 1>be indispensable.</v>

43
00:02:13.301 --> 00:02:15.190
<v Speaker 1>They're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just as useful.</v>

44
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.640
<v Speaker 1>So it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to permanently put down</v>

45
00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.810
<v Speaker 1>someone who's really good at doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>things because they can just go off and</v>

46
00:02:25.811 --> 00:02:28.900
<v Speaker 1>do them somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the ways that you get like</v>

47
00:02:28.901 --> 00:02:33.901
<v Speaker 1>that is to take responsibility when</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone else is failing to do so.</v>

48
00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:35.021
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

49
00:02:35.021 --> 00:02:37.390
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>

50
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.340
<v Speaker 1>Another way of thinking about it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh good,</v>

51
00:02:39.341 --> 00:02:40.300
<v Speaker 1>I get to do that.</v>
