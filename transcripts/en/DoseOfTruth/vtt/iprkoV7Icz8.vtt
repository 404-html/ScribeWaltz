1
00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.310
<v Speaker 1>I've been struggling with an idea recently that I was thinking maybe it'd be</v>

2
00:00:12.311 --> 00:00:17.080
<v Speaker 1>able to help me out with basically in a recent interview you talked about how</v>

3
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.910
<v Speaker 1>myth is meant to reconcile inherent contradictions in reality,</v>

4
00:00:21.911 --> 00:00:22.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.740
<v Speaker 1>But I'm sort of stuck between two mythological or psychoanalytic ideas that I</v>

6
00:00:29.711 --> 00:00:31.180
<v Speaker 1>think are both really important,</v>

7
00:00:31.181 --> 00:00:35.080
<v Speaker 1>but they seem to have a inherent contradiction within them that I've been trying</v>

8
00:00:35.081 --> 00:00:35.860
<v Speaker 1>to figure out.</v>

9
00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.820
<v Speaker 1>So on one hand you have this idea that there's times in your life where you have</v>

10
00:00:39.821 --> 00:00:43.960
<v Speaker 1>to identify things in yourself that are insufficient or there's a problem</v>

11
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.990
<v Speaker 1>somehow that you have to kind of have a controlled burn or like a Phoenix like</v>

12
00:00:49.301 --> 00:00:54.160
<v Speaker 1>transformation where you discard part of yourself that doesn't fit or is not</v>

13
00:00:54.161 --> 00:00:54.994
<v Speaker 1>working.</v>

14
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.380
<v Speaker 1>But then on the other hand,</v>

15
00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:57.930
<v Speaker 1>you have talked about this,</v>

16
00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.720
<v Speaker 1>this union idea where as you become really,</v>

17
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:02.740
<v Speaker 1>when you get older,</v>

18
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.780
<v Speaker 1>you mature by reincorporating things about yourself that you lost when you were</v>

19
00:01:07.781 --> 00:01:09.940
<v Speaker 1>younger or that you know,</v>

20
00:01:09.941 --> 00:01:12.880
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to integrate your shadow or you're trying to find parts of your</v>

21
00:01:12.881 --> 00:01:13.760
<v Speaker 1>personality that,</v>

22
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.650
<v Speaker 1>that maybe you've been rejecting and trying to figure out how to bring them</v>

23
00:01:17.651 --> 00:01:17.930
<v Speaker 1>into,</v>

24
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:18.820
<v Speaker 1>into the folder.</v>

25
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:19.653
<v Speaker 1>And then the whole,</v>

26
00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.530
<v Speaker 1>so he's got this quote that I really like,</v>

27
00:01:21.531 --> 00:01:24.400
<v Speaker 1>which is I'd rather be holding good.</v>

28
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.791
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

29
00:01:24.791 --> 00:01:25.270
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

30
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.781
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

31
00:01:25.781 --> 00:01:30.370
<v Speaker 1>so on one hand you may identify something as a problem and you want to get rid</v>

32
00:01:30.371 --> 00:01:31.330
<v Speaker 1>of it or burn it off.</v>

33
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:32.650
<v Speaker 1>But then on the other hand,</v>

34
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.140
<v Speaker 1>it seems like the,</v>

35
00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.630
<v Speaker 1>the path to being stronger is to figure out how to put everything together.</v>

36
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.391
<v Speaker 2>So there's a,</v>

37
00:01:42.391 --> 00:01:43.210
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

38
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.150
<v Speaker 2>one of the things young wrote about in his works on alchemy was,</v>

39
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.200
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

40
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.140
<v Speaker 2>an explanation of the prime l chemical dictum,</v>

41
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.180
<v Speaker 2>which was Solvay Coagula,</v>

42
00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.190
<v Speaker 2>which meant dissolve and integrate.</v>

43
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.933
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

44
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.341
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

45
00:01:56.341 --> 00:01:56.671
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

46
00:01:56.671 --> 00:01:57.960
<v Speaker 2>so imagine this,</v>

47
00:01:57.961 --> 00:01:58.794
<v Speaker 2>imagine that.</v>

48
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.310
<v Speaker 2>Imagine you had a fairly hostile father who is not very well controlled in his</v>

49
00:02:05.431 --> 00:02:06.264
<v Speaker 2>aggression,</v>

50
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.770
<v Speaker 2>decent person other than that,</v>

51
00:02:08.771 --> 00:02:09.730
<v Speaker 2>but let's say that,</v>

52
00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:11.440
<v Speaker 2>and so your reaction is,</v>

53
00:02:11.441 --> 00:02:12.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm never going to be aggressive.</v>

54
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.970
<v Speaker 2>And so you've built a like a moral structure that's part of your personality and</v>

55
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.770
<v Speaker 2>there's possibility floating around.</v>

56
00:02:22.771 --> 00:02:23.521
<v Speaker 2>Outside of that,</v>

57
00:02:23.521 --> 00:02:24.090
<v Speaker 2>did you,</v>

58
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.860
<v Speaker 2>you've denied an ethical,</v>

59
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.950
<v Speaker 2>you've denied any ethical.</v>

60
00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.170
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

61
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.003
<v Speaker 2>what would you say?</v>

62
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.300
<v Speaker 2>You've stripped the idea of aggression of any ethical utility whatsoever.</v>

63
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:36.171
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

64
00:02:36.171 --> 00:02:37.010
<v Speaker 2>so what happens?</v>

65
00:02:37.011 --> 00:02:39.860
<v Speaker 2>This burns off and then that comes back up.</v>

66
00:02:39.861 --> 00:02:41.180
<v Speaker 2>Now you still have to integrate it.</v>

67
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.650
<v Speaker 2>So it's associated in some sense with niches,</v>

68
00:02:44.651 --> 00:02:45.484
<v Speaker 2>ideas,</v>

69
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.460
<v Speaker 2>morality as cowardice.</v>

70
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.880
<v Speaker 2>Because one of nature's most trenchant critiques of traditional morality,</v>

71
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.373
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

72
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.910
<v Speaker 2>is that most of what passes for morality isn't morality.</v>

73
00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.110
<v Speaker 2>It's just cowardice.</v>

74
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.170
<v Speaker 2>It's not that I'm a good person and I don't hurt you.</v>

75
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.980
<v Speaker 2>It's that I'm afraid to hurt you and because I don't want to admit that I'm</v>

76
00:03:05.981 --> 00:03:06.910
<v Speaker 2>afraid to hurt you.</v>

77
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:12.160
<v Speaker 2>Then I say I'm moral because then I can mask my essential fear and cowardice in</v>

78
00:03:12.161 --> 00:03:13.840
<v Speaker 2>a guise of morality.</v>

79
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.610
<v Speaker 2>And that happens far more often than you would think because harmless and moral</v>

80
00:03:18.611 --> 00:03:20.140
<v Speaker 2>are by no means the same thing.</v>

81
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.810
<v Speaker 2>So some of what you're burning off,</v>

82
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.801
<v Speaker 2>you can sit,</v>

83
00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:27.670
<v Speaker 2>and this is where Freud was such a genius I think is because he concentrated on</v>

84
00:03:27.671 --> 00:03:28.900
<v Speaker 2>aggression in sexuality,</v>

85
00:03:28.901 --> 00:03:32.770
<v Speaker 2>which are perhaps the two most difficult parts of a personality to integrate.</v>

86
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.053
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>

87
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.253
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

88
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:36.310
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

89
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.143
<v Speaker 2>the</v>

90
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.290
<v Speaker 2>hyper simplified morality stops you from tapping into deeper recesses of your</v>

91
00:03:47.741 --> 00:03:48.574
<v Speaker 2>psyche.</v>

92
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.490
<v Speaker 2>And it's partly because there are primal forces.</v>

93
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.940
<v Speaker 2>It's not surprising that you don't want to have anything to do with them,</v>

94
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.510
<v Speaker 2>that you stay away from situations where they might make themselves manifest.</v>

95
00:03:58.511 --> 00:04:01.670
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is by denying the worst in yourself in that matter,</v>

96
00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:02.543
<v Speaker 2>suppressing it,</v>

97
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.680
<v Speaker 2>you preclude the possibility of the best because no one can be a good person</v>

98
00:04:07.811 --> 00:04:09.760
<v Speaker 2>without integrating their capacity for aggression.</v>

99
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.000
<v Speaker 2>Because without that capacity for aggression,</v>

100
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.680
<v Speaker 2>you cannot say no.</v>

101
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.720
<v Speaker 2>Because no means,</v>

102
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.040
<v Speaker 2>if you really say it,</v>

103
00:04:18.041 --> 00:04:22.720
<v Speaker 2>no means there isn't anything that you can do to me that will make me change my</v>

104
00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:23.620
<v Speaker 2>mind or,</v>

105
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.580
<v Speaker 2>or conversely it means I will play for higher stakes than you will.</v>

106
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.350
<v Speaker 2>And unless you've got your aggression integrated,</v>

107
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.510
<v Speaker 2>there isn't a chance you can say that.</v>

108
00:04:34.511 --> 00:04:35.081
<v Speaker 2>And if you did,</v>

109
00:04:35.081 --> 00:04:38.800
<v Speaker 2>no one would take you seriously because they'd know it was just a show.</v>

110
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.970
<v Speaker 2>So one of the most useful things that young did,</v>

111
00:04:42.971 --> 00:04:46.390
<v Speaker 2>I think was to work on this idea of the integration of the shadow because he was</v>

112
00:04:46.391 --> 00:04:47.980
<v Speaker 2>really interested in the idea of evil,</v>

113
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.251
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

114
00:04:48.251 --> 00:04:53.200
<v Speaker 2>Especially working with trying to parcel out what happened in Nazi Germany and</v>

115
00:04:53.201 --> 00:04:54.430
<v Speaker 2>during the Second World War.</v>

116
00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.850
<v Speaker 2>What do you do with the part of you that's aggressive and potentially</v>

117
00:04:57.851 --> 00:04:58.371
<v Speaker 2>malevolent?</v>

118
00:04:58.371 --> 00:04:59.410
<v Speaker 2>You just crush it.</v>

119
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.690
<v Speaker 2>That's the super ego response in some sense.</v>

120
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.040
<v Speaker 2>You just put it behind you,</v>

121
00:05:03.041 --> 00:05:03.970
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>

122
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.860
<v Speaker 2>Is that a possibility or do you admit to its existence and bring it into the</v>

123
00:05:08.861 --> 00:05:09.694
<v Speaker 2>game?</v>

124
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:10.563
<v Speaker 2>And that's</v>

125
00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:12.340
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

126
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.210
<v Speaker 2>for Freud.</v>

127
00:05:13.211 --> 00:05:13.931
<v Speaker 2>In some sense,</v>

128
00:05:13.931 --> 00:05:18.580
<v Speaker 2>morality was super ego clamping down on the bed and there were fundamentally</v>

129
00:05:18.581 --> 00:05:19.414
<v Speaker 2>opposed,</v>

130
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.970
<v Speaker 2>both young and Piaget had a different idea.</v>

131
00:05:21.971 --> 00:05:22.960
<v Speaker 2>And I think they were right.</v>

132
00:05:22.961 --> 00:05:23.560
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

133
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.831
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

134
00:05:23.831 --> 00:05:24.041
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

135
00:05:24.041 --> 00:05:27.280
<v Speaker 2>you invite the bad guys I out to play.</v>

136
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.310
<v Speaker 2>And so you're an aggressive hockey player,</v>

137
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.600
<v Speaker 2>but it's disciplined aggression that makes you,</v>

138
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.200
<v Speaker 2>gives you access to a whole source of energy you wouldn't otherwise have.</v>

139
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.150
<v Speaker 2>And then with regards to sexuality,</v>

140
00:05:40.151 --> 00:05:40.511
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

141
00:05:40.511 --> 00:05:40.900
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

142
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.870
<v Speaker 2>untrammeled promiscuity doesn't constitute a virtue,</v>

143
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.680
<v Speaker 2>but neither does unavoidable virginity.</v>

144
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:48.490
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

145
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.941
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

146
00:05:48.941 --> 00:05:52.840
<v Speaker 2>I think that's worse because it also masks itself with virtue.</v>

147
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:53.771
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

148
00:05:53.771 --> 00:05:53.951
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

149
00:05:53.951 --> 00:05:55.330
<v Speaker 2>you should be able to,</v>

150
00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.230
<v Speaker 2>you should be to do things that you wouldn't do.</v>

151
00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:00.093
<v Speaker 2>That's uh,</v>

152
00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:04.060
<v Speaker 2>that's like the definition of a genuinely moral person.</v>

153
00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:05.620
<v Speaker 2>They could do it,</v>

154
00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:07.403
<v Speaker 2>but they don't.</v>

155
00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:09.870
<v Speaker 2>That's not cowardice.</v>

156
00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.883
<v Speaker 2>And so that's,</v>

157
00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.670
<v Speaker 2>you burn off the things that get in the way of that integration.</v>

158
00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.590
<v Speaker 1>So when you say dissolve in integrate yet to be a good way to sort of bring the</v>

159
00:06:19.591 --> 00:06:24.591
<v Speaker 1>two ideas together that the burning off and the difficult processes necessary</v>

160
00:06:25.111 --> 00:06:29.760
<v Speaker 1>because the elements of yourself are structured together in a rigid way that is</v>

161
00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.380
<v Speaker 1>not working properly.</v>

162
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.821
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

163
00:06:31.821 --> 00:06:32.960
<v Speaker 2>that's what happens to Japan.</v>

164
00:06:32.961 --> 00:06:34.220
<v Speaker 2>Low in the belly of the whale.</v>

165
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.260
<v Speaker 2>He's so caught in his presuppositions that he can't escape right in.</v>

166
00:06:39.261 --> 00:06:41.150
<v Speaker 2>So Pinocchio represents the new forest.</v>

167
00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:42.380
<v Speaker 2>So it's very interesting.</v>

168
00:06:42.381 --> 00:06:43.550
<v Speaker 2>So when You Watch Pinocchio,</v>

169
00:06:43.551 --> 00:06:44.570
<v Speaker 2>tried to rescue him.</v>

170
00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:45.740
<v Speaker 2>The first thing Japan,</v>

171
00:06:45.741 --> 00:06:49.250
<v Speaker 2>Oh does is Confuse Pinocchio with a fish because he wants something to eat.</v>

172
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.310
<v Speaker 2>But Pinocchio is better than something to eat because he could rescue him.</v>

173
00:06:52.311 --> 00:06:53.570
<v Speaker 2>So he doesn't need to eat.</v>

174
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:57.770
<v Speaker 2>And then Pinocchio wants to make a fire in Japan objects because he's going to</v>

175
00:06:57.771 --> 00:06:58.850
<v Speaker 2>burn up all the furniture.</v>

176
00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:02.300
<v Speaker 2>So like we don't need the damn furniture if we're getting out of the whale,</v>

177
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.080
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

178
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:03.680
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

179
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.311
<v Speaker 2>so Japan,</v>

180
00:07:04.311 --> 00:07:04.550
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

181
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:05.510
<v Speaker 2>and he's old.</v>

182
00:07:05.511 --> 00:07:05.931
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>

183
00:07:05.931 --> 00:07:06.190
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

184
00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:06.980
<v Speaker 2>that's the,</v>

185
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:08.120
<v Speaker 2>that's the rigid structure.</v>

186
00:07:08.121 --> 00:07:11.570
<v Speaker 2>That's the old year that has to die off before the new year can be born.</v>

187
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:16.010
<v Speaker 2>It's a forest fire that allows for new growth and that's how those things are</v>

188
00:07:16.011 --> 00:07:17.600
<v Speaker 2>put together and to see,</v>

189
00:07:17.601 --> 00:07:18.890
<v Speaker 2>and it's useful to know too,</v>

190
00:07:18.891 --> 00:07:20.360
<v Speaker 2>because if you burn something off,</v>

191
00:07:20.361 --> 00:07:20.841
<v Speaker 2>you might think,</v>

192
00:07:20.841 --> 00:07:20.961
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

193
00:07:20.961 --> 00:07:22.040
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing left.</v>

194
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:22.641
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

195
00:07:22.641 --> 00:07:23.474
<v Speaker 2>that's not true.</v>

196
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:24.830
<v Speaker 2>If it's dead wood,</v>

197
00:07:24.831 --> 00:07:28.730
<v Speaker 2>then you have room for new growth and you want to be doing that on a fairly</v>

198
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.410
<v Speaker 2>regular basis.</v>

199
00:07:30.411 --> 00:07:31.040
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>

200
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:35.060
<v Speaker 2>that's that's the snake that sheds its skin and transforms itself,</v>

201
00:07:35.061 --> 00:07:35.271
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

202
00:07:35.271 --> 00:07:36.030
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

203
00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:38.190
<v Speaker 2>that's the death and resurrection.</v>

204
00:07:38.191 --> 00:07:39.720
<v Speaker 2>From a psychological perspective,</v>

205
00:07:39.721 --> 00:07:41.070
<v Speaker 2>it's exactly the same idea.</v>

206
00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:43.290
<v Speaker 2>Now we don't know the upper limit to that,</v>

207
00:07:43.291 --> 00:07:43.531
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

208
00:07:43.531 --> 00:07:46.860
<v Speaker 2>because we don't know what a person would be like if they let everything that</v>

209
00:07:46.861 --> 00:07:48.090
<v Speaker 2>they could let go,</v>

210
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:52.920
<v Speaker 2>let go and only let in what was seemly,</v>

211
00:07:52.921 --> 00:07:53.754
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

212
00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:55.560
<v Speaker 2>but you can see that.</v>

213
00:07:55.561 --> 00:07:56.310
<v Speaker 2>It's funny,</v>

214
00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:59.580
<v Speaker 2>we don't know that to some degree you can see people very far.</v>

215
00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:02.850
<v Speaker 2>You can see people start to do that without,</v>

216
00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:06.560
<v Speaker 2>that's not an rare experience.</v>

217
00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.720
<v Speaker 2>And people improve very rapidly.</v>

218
00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:11.460
<v Speaker 2>They can improve their lives very rapidly.</v>

219
00:08:11.461 --> 00:08:12.900
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it's low hanging fruit.</v>

220
00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:17.430
<v Speaker 2>Like if you just stopped doing really stupid things that you know are stupid,</v>

221
00:08:17.431 --> 00:08:18.840
<v Speaker 2>your life improves a lot.</v>

222
00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:20.100
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

223
00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:20.490
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>

224
00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:21.570
<v Speaker 2>it frees you up.</v>

225
00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.220
<v Speaker 2>It also means there's a,</v>

226
00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:28.100
<v Speaker 2>there's an element there that's also associated with pride because people tend</v>

227
00:08:28.101 --> 00:08:29.360
<v Speaker 2>to take pride in who they are.</v>

228
00:08:29.361 --> 00:08:34.361
<v Speaker 2>And that's a bad idea because that stops you from becoming who you could be</v>

229
00:08:34.461 --> 00:08:35.990
<v Speaker 2>because if you're proud of who you are,</v>

230
00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:38.510
<v Speaker 2>you won't let that go when it's necessary.</v>

231
00:08:38.511 --> 00:08:39.920
<v Speaker 2>You won't step away from it,</v>

232
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:40.611
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

233
00:08:40.611 --> 00:08:43.100
<v Speaker 2>And then you end up being your own parody,</v>

234
00:08:43.101 --> 00:08:44.000
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

235
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:45.970
<v Speaker 2>That's also a very bad idea.</v>

236
00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:51.140
<v Speaker 2>You want to be continually stepping away from your previous self and so big.</v>

237
00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:53.180
<v Speaker 2>And I guess part of that too is that you,</v>

238
00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:54.540
<v Speaker 2>you have to decide,</v>

239
00:08:54.541 --> 00:08:54.781
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

240
00:08:54.781 --> 00:08:55.614
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

241
00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:56.910
<v Speaker 2>are you order,</v>

242
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.970
<v Speaker 2>are you chaos or are you the process that mediates between them?</v>

243
00:08:59.971 --> 00:09:01.980
<v Speaker 2>And if you're the process that mediates between them,</v>

244
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:02.640
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

245
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:07.560
<v Speaker 2>you are the thing that transforms and that's the right attitude for human being</v>

246
00:09:07.561 --> 00:09:09.120
<v Speaker 2>because that's what we are.</v>

247
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.860
<v Speaker 2>We're the thing that voluntarily confronts chaos and transforms.</v>

248
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:15.180
<v Speaker 2>That's what we are.</v>

249
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:17.250
<v Speaker 2>And so for better or worse,</v>

250
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:18.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

251
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:21.180
<v Speaker 2>that's our deepest biological essence,</v>

252
00:09:21.181 --> 00:09:22.014
<v Speaker 2>you might say.</v>

253
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:25.500
<v Speaker 2>And so you can let things go if you know that there's more growth to come.</v>
