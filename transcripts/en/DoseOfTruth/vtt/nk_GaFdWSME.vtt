1
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.050
<v Speaker 1>So what's the logic?</v>

2
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.680
<v Speaker 1>Something like,</v>

3
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:13.801
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4
00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:16.410
<v Speaker 1>there's an infinite number of interpretations of the world.</v>

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.500
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

6
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.990
<v Speaker 1>You can't tell which of those are canonically crap.</v>

7
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:21.853
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

8
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.430
<v Speaker 1>The basic narrative of human struggle,</v>

9
00:00:25.431 --> 00:00:27.020
<v Speaker 1>his oppressor versus oppressed.</v>

10
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.610
<v Speaker 1>We use category structures to can constrain that infinite number of</v>

11
00:00:31.611 --> 00:00:36.050
<v Speaker 1>interpretations because the basic narrative is oppressor versus oppressed.</v>

12
00:00:36.051 --> 00:00:40.760
<v Speaker 1>We choose those narratives that serve our function as old pressers.</v>

13
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.150
<v Speaker 1>So it's</v>

14
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.450
<v Speaker 1>deeply cynical but credible.</v>

15
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:50.751
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

16
00:00:50.751 --> 00:00:55.751
<v Speaker 1>and you can say if you're not naive that people are motivated by power and that</v>

17
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.610
<v Speaker 1>our interpretations of the world can be self serving.</v>

18
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean we do want to serve ourselves after all because otherwise we die and so,</v>

19
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.730
<v Speaker 1>and we are centered in one place and so we can't see everything and we're</v>

20
00:01:10.731 --> 00:01:11.564
<v Speaker 1>biased.</v>

21
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.913
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

22
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.840
<v Speaker 1>so there is the probability that the way that we look in the war at the world</v>

23
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.230
<v Speaker 1>will be tainted by narrow self interest and maybe even tainted by ingroup</v>

24
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.400
<v Speaker 1>interests beyond narrow individual self interest.</v>

25
00:01:26.401 --> 00:01:27.530
<v Speaker 1>And we know this is true,</v>

26
00:01:27.531 --> 00:01:29.240
<v Speaker 1>but it's also not all bad.</v>

27
00:01:29.241 --> 00:01:29.481
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

28
00:01:29.481 --> 00:01:34.481
<v Speaker 1>like we a good person takes care of his or her family or does that mean it means</v>

29
00:01:34.521 --> 00:01:36.800
<v Speaker 1>you prefer your family and outsiders?</v>

30
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.510
<v Speaker 1>You we're going to get rid of that.</v>

31
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.070
<v Speaker 1>It's a form of prejudice.</v>

32
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.080
<v Speaker 1>Like it really is like your choice of sexual partners as a form of prejudice,</v>

33
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.303
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

34
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe it should be distributed in an egalitarian manner.</v>

35
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.103
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

36
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.750
<v Speaker 1>that would be a lot funnier if it isn't a possibility.</v>

37
00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.310
<v Speaker 1>And like in,</v>

38
00:01:58.311 --> 00:01:58.521
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

39
00:01:58.521 --> 00:01:58.911
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

40
00:01:58.911 --> 00:01:59.540
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

41
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.760
<v Speaker 1>in Huxley's brave new world,</v>

42
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.560
<v Speaker 1>that was the rule you,</v>

43
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.490
<v Speaker 1>you shared yourself with whoever asked because it was rude not to and you know</v>

44
00:02:07.491 --> 00:02:09.920
<v Speaker 1>what it is actually rude not to.</v>

45
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.870
<v Speaker 1>It's seriously rude.</v>

46
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.321
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

47
00:02:12.321 --> 00:02:14.210
<v Speaker 1>is that something you want to take away from people?</v>

48
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.450
<v Speaker 1>You want that to be distributed in an egalitarian fashion.</v>

49
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.800
<v Speaker 1>How prejudice star you when you choose someone to sleep with,</v>

50
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.550
<v Speaker 1>you choose that person and not everyone else.</v>

51
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.500
<v Speaker 1>It's the ultimate in prejudice.</v>

52
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.941
<v Speaker 1>If Hey,</v>

53
00:02:27.941 --> 00:02:28.180
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

54
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.390
<v Speaker 1>well that's not prejudicial.</v>

55
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.871
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes,</v>

56
00:02:29.871 --> 00:02:30.680
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

57
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.320
<v Speaker 1>Usually go for the most attractive partner you can find.</v>

58
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.870
<v Speaker 1>Usually go to for the healthiest partner.</v>

59
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:36.131
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

60
00:02:36.131 --> 00:02:39.560
<v Speaker 1>you go for the best person you can find who can tolerate you.</v>

61
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.850
<v Speaker 1>It's prejudicial in,</v>

62
00:02:41.851 --> 00:02:43.640
<v Speaker 1>in every possible way.</v>

63
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.990
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
