00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.290
<v Speaker 1>Part of the reason that Islam has its backup with regards to the west to such a</v>

2
00:00:07.291 --> 00:00:07.890
<v Speaker 1>degree.</v>

3
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's many reasons that not all of them are valid,</v>

4
00:00:10.171 --> 00:00:10.831
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

5
00:00:10.831 --> 00:00:12.570
<v Speaker 1>But one of the reasons is that,</v>

6
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:13.221
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7
00:00:13.221 --> 00:00:13.450
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

8
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.600
<v Speaker 1>they being still grounded in a,</v>

9
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:16.080
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

10
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.771
<v Speaker 1>in a dream,</v>

11
00:00:16.771 --> 00:00:17.604
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

12
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.620
<v Speaker 1>they can see that the root less questioning mind of the west pope poses a</v>

13
00:00:22.621 --> 00:00:26.040
<v Speaker 1>tremendous danger to the integrity of their culture now.</v>

14
00:00:26.041 --> 00:00:26.701
<v Speaker 1>And it does,</v>

15
00:00:26.701 --> 00:00:28.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean Westerners,</v>

16
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.100
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>

17
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.460
<v Speaker 1>we undermine ourselves all the time with our searching intellect.</v>

18
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.270
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not complaining about Pat.</v>

19
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.203
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

20
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.720
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

21
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.180
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

22
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.550
<v Speaker 1>there isn't anything easy that can be done about it,</v>

23
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:39.403
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

24
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:40.740
<v Speaker 1>but it's still,</v>

25
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.100
<v Speaker 1>it's still sort of fruitful catastrophe and you know,</v>

26
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.900
<v Speaker 1>it has real effects on people's lives.</v>

27
00:00:48.901 --> 00:00:50.080
<v Speaker 1>It's not some abstract thing.</v>
