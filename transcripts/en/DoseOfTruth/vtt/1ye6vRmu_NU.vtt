1
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm quite shy and when asked questions</v>
<v Speaker 1>in public,</v>

2
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.520
<v Speaker 1>I find it hard to articulate a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>answer,</v>

3
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.180
<v Speaker 1>but we'll come up with a strong response</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours or days later.</v>

4
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.530
<v Speaker 1>Any advice?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5
00:00:18.531 --> 00:00:21.020
<v Speaker 1>I have some advice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is that,</v>

6
00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:23.270
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you're probably introverted day so</v>

7
00:00:23.271 --> 00:00:26.840
<v Speaker 1>you're not as verbally fluent as an</v>
<v Speaker 1>extrovert would be a not quite as fast</v>

8
00:00:26.841 --> 00:00:28.670
<v Speaker 1>on the draw verbally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

9
00:00:28.671 --> 00:00:32.210
<v Speaker 1>that means you need some more time to</v>
<v Speaker 1>contemplate and maybe you're high in</v>

10
00:00:32.211 --> 00:00:34.240
<v Speaker 1>negative emotion too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

11
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.850
<v Speaker 1>because shyness can be a combination of</v>
<v Speaker 1>introversion and high negative emotion.</v>

12
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.070
<v Speaker 1>It can be one or the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

13
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.910
<v Speaker 1>but technically shy is introverted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

14
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.480
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I would certainly recommend for you</v>

15
00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:51.470
<v Speaker 1>is that if you're faced with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated question,</v>

16
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.340
<v Speaker 1>especially one that has to do with an</v>
<v Speaker 1>important decision in your life that you</v>

17
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.810
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to sleep on it or I need a couple</v>

18
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.690
<v Speaker 1>of days and not to answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

19
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:04.723
<v Speaker 1>on the draw.</v>

20
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's true even for extroverts.</v>

21
00:01:07.521 --> 00:01:11.930
<v Speaker 1>I think if you're at called upon to</v>
<v Speaker 1>offer your opinion about something</v>

22
00:01:11.931 --> 00:01:14.390
<v Speaker 1>complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's perfectly reasonable to say,</v>

23
00:01:14.391 --> 00:01:16.400
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a really hard question.</v>

24
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to give you a casual</v>
<v Speaker 1>answer.</v>

25
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.360
<v Speaker 1>I need to think about it for a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

26
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.010
<v Speaker 1>So the advice would be because you find</v>
<v Speaker 1>it hard to articulate a good answer,</v>

27
00:01:25.011 --> 00:01:28.880
<v Speaker 1>don't allow yourself to be rushed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the second is to understand that</v>

28
00:01:28.881 --> 00:01:31.640
<v Speaker 1>this is part of your temperament there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There isn't anything wrong with it.</v>

29
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.430
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

30
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.090
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's how you're wired.</v>

31
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.040
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>what causes a person to hoard is due to</v>

32
00:01:40.041 --> 00:01:43.340
<v Speaker 1>low conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is generally the best course of</v>

33
00:01:43.341 --> 00:01:44.440
<v Speaker 1>treatment?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

34
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.730
<v Speaker 1>it's usually a consequence of relatively</v>
<v Speaker 1>high in neuroticism.</v>

35
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.330
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's tangled in with disgust,</v>

36
00:01:53.331 --> 00:01:56.000
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

37
00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.270
<v Speaker 1>people who hoard have a hard time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They feel guilty if they throw things</v>

38
00:02:01.851 --> 00:02:05.450
<v Speaker 1>away because the thing's still have some</v>
<v Speaker 1>residual utility.</v>

39
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.700
<v Speaker 1>The best course of treatment is well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavioral therapies probably the best</v>

40
00:02:10.701 --> 00:02:15.701
<v Speaker 1>course of treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to plan what needs to be thrown away</v>

41
00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.820
<v Speaker 1>and to work with a person that can help</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make the hard decisions that,</v>

42
00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.900
<v Speaker 1>that need to be made if you're hoarding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

43
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.990
<v Speaker 1>all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that hoarded material is an,</v>

44
00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.220
<v Speaker 1>it's decisions that have been put off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of that is high neuroticism.</v>

45
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.800
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of that can be a consequence of low</v>

46
00:02:44.801 --> 00:02:49.300
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the best course of treatment is to</v>

47
00:02:49.301 --> 00:02:53.210
<v Speaker 1>find someone to help you plan how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>approach the,</v>

48
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.480
<v Speaker 1>the horde.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very complicated.</v>

49
00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.390
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

50
00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.730
<v Speaker 1>Which Hogwarts house would you be in?</v>

51
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.123
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

52
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.630
<v Speaker 1>well I think I'd have the same issue as</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harry Potter when the hat was first put</v>

53
00:03:20.631 --> 00:03:22.460
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would think that I might make a</v>

54
00:03:22.461 --> 00:03:25.910
<v Speaker 1>perfectly good Dennis and of slitherin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

55
00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although that probably wouldn't be where</v>

56
00:03:28.311 --> 00:03:30.290
<v Speaker 1>I would end up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

57
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.010
<v Speaker 1>what is your take on an astrological</v>
<v Speaker 1>basis for significant dates in religious</v>

58
00:03:43.011 --> 00:03:44.420
<v Speaker 1>stories?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Example,</v>

59
00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.330
<v Speaker 1>Christian religion is a parody on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>worship of the sun.</v>

60
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly not a parody.</v>

61
00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>

62
00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.950
<v Speaker 1>religious systems as the expand tend to</v>
<v Speaker 1>incorporate everything that's quasi</v>

63
00:03:57.591 --> 00:04:00.830
<v Speaker 1>religious in the culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's certainly no shortage of</v>

64
00:04:00.831 --> 00:04:03.890
<v Speaker 1>solar symbolism in Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

65
00:04:03.891 --> 00:04:08.891
<v Speaker 1>it's not fluke that that Christ is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>son and there are 12 disciples just like</v>

66
00:04:09.861 --> 00:04:13.010
<v Speaker 1>there are 12 astrological houses and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not fluke that,</v>

67
00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.293
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

68
00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.890
<v Speaker 1>the birth of Christ takes place</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially at the same time as,</v>

69
00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.380
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the shortest day of the year.</v>

70
00:04:21.381 --> 00:04:24.860
<v Speaker 1>And the rebirth of the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of these things line up.</v>

71
00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.320
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether that synchronicity or whether</v>

72
00:04:27.321 --> 00:04:32.321
<v Speaker 1>it's the attempt by the collective</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination of human beings to align</v>

73
00:04:33.891 --> 00:04:37.850
<v Speaker 1>everything under a single truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very difficult thing to say.</v>

74
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.530
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe there's a single truth at work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the idea that Christian religion is</v>

75
00:04:42.531 --> 00:04:44.690
<v Speaker 1>a parody on the worship of the sun is</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

76
00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.660
<v Speaker 1>is definitely not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more like it's incorporated</v>

77
00:04:47.661 --> 00:04:52.160
<v Speaker 1>elements of the worship of the sun over</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands and thousands of years.</v>

78
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.060
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very complicated issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're interested in that,</v>

79
00:04:56.061 --> 00:05:00.020
<v Speaker 1>you could read I on a I o.</v>
<v Speaker 1>N it's booked by Carl Young,</v>

80
00:05:00.021 --> 00:05:02.270
<v Speaker 1>which is like the most terrifying book</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've ever read.</v>

81
00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.140
<v Speaker 1>And so you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a deeper analysis of the</v>

82
00:05:06.141 --> 00:05:08.510
<v Speaker 1>relationship between astrological</v>
<v Speaker 1>speculation.</v>

83
00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.010
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

84
00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.010
<v Speaker 1>and the emergence of complex religious</v>
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>

85
00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.293
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

86
00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.470
<v Speaker 1>my brother 29 is sick at home with</v>
<v Speaker 1>burnout.</v>

87
00:05:27.471 --> 00:05:29.230
<v Speaker 1>He's a perfectionist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has anxiety,</v>

88
00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.510
<v Speaker 1>has trouble dealing with stress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can I help them become stronger?</v>

89
00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could encourage him to go talk to a</v>

90
00:05:34.431 --> 00:05:36.840
<v Speaker 1>therapist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could tell him to go find broadly,</v>

91
00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.060
<v Speaker 1>make an appointment with three of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go talk to each one for an hour.</v>

92
00:05:41.061 --> 00:05:43.550
<v Speaker 1>And if he likes one of them and he finds</v>
<v Speaker 1>when who listens,</v>

93
00:05:43.551 --> 00:05:46.340
<v Speaker 1>then he can go back a couple more times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it isn't going to hurt him to go</v>

94
00:05:46.341 --> 00:05:48.140
<v Speaker 1>once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least to go talk.</v>

95
00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also possible that he needs someone</v>

96
00:05:51.261 --> 00:05:53.660
<v Speaker 1>to talk to them about medication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

97
00:05:53.661 --> 00:05:56.120
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he's in real trouble.</v>

98
00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.490
<v Speaker 1>Antidepressants often very helpful to</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

99
00:05:58.491 --> 00:05:59.600
<v Speaker 1>not always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but often.</v>

100
00:05:59.601 --> 00:06:04.520
<v Speaker 1>And so that is a lot better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taking an antidepressant beats the hell</v>

101
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.870
<v Speaker 1>out of being sick at home with burnout</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's attended dangers,</v>

102
00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:11.810
<v Speaker 1>cognitive dangers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangers of stress induced illness,</v>

103
00:06:11.811 --> 00:06:14.600
<v Speaker 1>dangers of suicidal ideation and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing.</v>

104
00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:18.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would also recommend that he tried the</v>

105
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.560
<v Speaker 1>self authoring program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he's at home,</v>

106
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.650
<v Speaker 1>he could write about his past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could write about his present,</v>

107
00:06:24.651 --> 00:06:26.810
<v Speaker 1>he could write about his future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can do a bad job,</v>

108
00:06:26.811 --> 00:06:28.850
<v Speaker 1>he can do it over days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

109
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean we have evidence that the program</v>
<v Speaker 1>is extremely helpful to people and</v>

110
00:06:32.301 --> 00:06:35.630
<v Speaker 1>there's evidence from other researchers</v>
<v Speaker 1>that such programs really help.</v>

111
00:06:35.631 --> 00:06:38.780
<v Speaker 1>So that would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be something that he could</v>

112
00:06:38.781 --> 00:06:39.111
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

113
00:06:39.111 --> 00:06:41.630
<v Speaker 1>he's sitting at home and it's not going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to hurt him.</v>

114
00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:46.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm going over some of the more complex</v>
<v Speaker 1>material might make them feel slightly</v>

115
00:06:46.371 --> 00:06:48.890
<v Speaker 1>worse in the short term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the long term payoff is very,</v>

116
00:06:48.891 --> 00:06:50.390
<v Speaker 1>very high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

117
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:55.100
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I would recommend.</v>

118
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.460
<v Speaker 1>Encourage him to go talk to somebody he</v>
<v Speaker 1>knew and he needs to make,</v>

119
00:06:58.461 --> 00:07:00.830
<v Speaker 1>the planning needs to come to terms with</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happened to him.</v>

120
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.730
<v Speaker 1>And He needs to make a plan and he might</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to talk to somebody for a long time</v>

121
00:07:04.731 --> 00:07:07.160
<v Speaker 1>to figure out what the hell's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

122
00:07:07.161 --> 00:07:09.560
<v Speaker 1>And we also don't want to rule out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and neither does he,</v>

123
00:07:09.561 --> 00:07:11.810
<v Speaker 1>the possibility that there's something</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical wrong,</v>

124
00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's increasing evidence that</v>

125
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:17.930
<v Speaker 1>the depressive disorders and that would</v>
<v Speaker 1>include anxiety,</v>

126
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.690
<v Speaker 1>are consequence of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of such conditions as,</v>

127
00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:24.080
<v Speaker 1>as generalized inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really worth looking into.</v>

128
00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:28.610
<v Speaker 1>So I think a lot of the things that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>think are psychological have a more</v>

129
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.100
<v Speaker 1>pronounced physical basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
