00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.900
<v Speaker 1>Richard zane</v>

2
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.510
<v Speaker 1>would love to hear about anxiety.</v>

3
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:16.090
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>

4
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.130
<v Speaker 1>that's a rough thing to have egg or a phobia.</v>

5
00:00:18.131 --> 00:00:23.131
<v Speaker 1>So agoraphobic get increasingly isolated and afraid of things outside of their</v>

6
00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:26.980
<v Speaker 1>domain and familiarity.</v>

7
00:00:26.981 --> 00:00:31.420
<v Speaker 1>And often what happens with Agora phobia is that people who develop it or afraid</v>

8
00:00:31.421 --> 00:00:32.254
<v Speaker 1>of two things,</v>

9
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.070
<v Speaker 1>they're afraid that something is going to go dreadfully wrong with their health,</v>

10
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.880
<v Speaker 1>especially with regards to their heart.</v>

11
00:00:37.881 --> 00:00:41.200
<v Speaker 1>So they start to become afraid that maybe they'll have a heart attack and that</v>

12
00:00:41.201 --> 00:00:42.310
<v Speaker 1>they'll die in public,</v>

13
00:00:42.311 --> 00:00:45.910
<v Speaker 1>far from a hospital and that they'll make a fool of themselves while they're</v>

14
00:00:45.911 --> 00:00:47.380
<v Speaker 1>doing it or well they,</v>

15
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:48.570
<v Speaker 1>well they think they're dying.</v>

16
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.590
<v Speaker 1>So it's a combination of two fears and one is fear of mortality and the other is</v>

17
00:00:53.591 --> 00:00:54.880
<v Speaker 1>fear of social judgement.</v>

18
00:00:54.881 --> 00:00:58.150
<v Speaker 1>And you might think about those as the two main categories of fear that</v>

19
00:00:58.151 --> 00:01:00.730
<v Speaker 1>possessed people because one is associated,</v>

20
00:01:00.731 --> 00:01:04.330
<v Speaker 1>well obviously with mortality and death and the other is associated with</v>

21
00:01:04.331 --> 00:01:05.620
<v Speaker 1>exclusion from the group,</v>

22
00:01:05.621 --> 00:01:08.230
<v Speaker 1>which of course can lead to mortality and death.</v>

23
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.720
<v Speaker 1>And so the agoraphobic is the worst of both worlds.</v>

24
00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.110
<v Speaker 1>It's often a disease of middle aged women.</v>

25
00:01:14.111 --> 00:01:15.070
<v Speaker 1>But not always.</v>

26
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.580
<v Speaker 1>And there are often people who've been somewhat dependent in their previous</v>

27
00:01:18.581 --> 00:01:21.250
<v Speaker 1>lives and then undergo some traumatic event,</v>

28
00:01:21.251 --> 00:01:23.830
<v Speaker 1>like a divorce or the death of someone close.</v>

29
00:01:23.831 --> 00:01:24.250
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

30
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.750
<v Speaker 1>and at the same time,</v>

31
00:01:25.751 --> 00:01:29.560
<v Speaker 1>our perhaps experiencing heart palpitations that are associated with menopause</v>

32
00:01:29.561 --> 00:01:34.561
<v Speaker 1>that brings ideas of mortality to mind and that can trigger a panic attack,</v>

33
00:01:35.741 --> 00:01:36.510
<v Speaker 1>which is very,</v>

34
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:37.030
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

35
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.863
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>

36
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.870
<v Speaker 1>Unpleasant experience to say the least.</v>

37
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:42.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

38
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.750
<v Speaker 1>and then that fear of panic attack starts making people avoid and that's when</v>

39
00:01:46.751 --> 00:01:50.600
<v Speaker 1>Agra phobia develops out of anxiety disorders with panic attack.</v>

40
00:01:50.601 --> 00:01:55.150
<v Speaker 1>So you go out and maybe you go to a mall and maybe you're in a crowd and maybe</v>

41
00:01:55.151 --> 00:01:56.170
<v Speaker 1>you start thinking about,</v>

42
00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.861
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

43
00:01:56.861 --> 00:01:59.890
<v Speaker 1>your heartbeat and about the fact that someone close to you is died.</v>

44
00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.820
<v Speaker 1>And maybe then you become aware of your heartbeat and you start to panic because</v>

45
00:02:03.821 --> 00:02:08.821
<v Speaker 1>you feel that maybe it's the beat is irregular or or that or that you can't</v>

46
00:02:08.861 --> 00:02:11.020
<v Speaker 1>detect it as well as you usually can.</v>

47
00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.290
<v Speaker 1>And then that makes your heart accelerate because it makes you afraid.</v>

48
00:02:14.291 --> 00:02:16.570
<v Speaker 1>And then you get more more,</v>

49
00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.470
<v Speaker 1>what would you call sensitive to that and that makes your heart rate beat even</v>

50
00:02:20.471 --> 00:02:21.011
<v Speaker 1>faster.</v>

51
00:02:21.011 --> 00:02:21.910
<v Speaker 1>And then you panic.</v>

52
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.420
<v Speaker 1>You want to get to the hospital to get checked out to make sure that you're all</v>

53
00:02:25.421 --> 00:02:28.210
<v Speaker 1>right and then you make your fatal mistake,</v>

54
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.740
<v Speaker 1>which is that you avoid going back to the mall and then you go to a grocery</v>

55
00:02:32.741 --> 00:02:35.860
<v Speaker 1>store in the same thing happens and then you start to avoid going to the grocery</v>

56
00:02:35.861 --> 00:02:36.490
<v Speaker 1>store.</v>

57
00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.350
<v Speaker 1>Then you start avoid avoiding the subway or taxis or crowds or anywhere you</v>

58
00:02:41.351 --> 00:02:43.930
<v Speaker 1>might get trapped and wouldn't be able to get to the hospital.</v>

59
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.910
<v Speaker 1>Soon you end up avoiding everything and that's when your life really starts to</v>

60
00:02:48.911 --> 00:02:50.080
<v Speaker 1>become a living hell.</v>

61
00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.470
<v Speaker 1>So the basic way to treat egg or a phobia,</v>

62
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.400
<v Speaker 1>there's two ways.</v>

63
00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.460
<v Speaker 1>One is to develop some control of breathing,</v>

64
00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.290
<v Speaker 1>to do progressive relaxation.</v>

65
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.660
<v Speaker 1>The way you do that is that you start with your,</v>

66
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.980
<v Speaker 1>you start by concentrating on your toes and your feet and your ankles,</v>

67
00:03:05.981 --> 00:03:07.870
<v Speaker 1>and then your shins and your knees.</v>

68
00:03:07.871 --> 00:03:12.310
<v Speaker 1>You move all the way up your body and let the tension flow out of your muscles</v>

69
00:03:12.311 --> 00:03:17.311
<v Speaker 1>and regulate your breathing calmly and carefully so that you can learn to relax.</v>

70
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.210
<v Speaker 1>And then you go out,</v>

71
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.760
<v Speaker 1>you go out voluntarily and start to confront the things you're afraid of.</v>

72
00:03:24.761 --> 00:03:25.630
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

73
00:03:25.631 --> 00:03:26.710
<v Speaker 1>if you're afraid of the mall,</v>

74
00:03:26.711 --> 00:03:30.790
<v Speaker 1>maybe you go to the parking lot and you look at the mall and then you walk close</v>

75
00:03:30.791 --> 00:03:32.530
<v Speaker 1>to the door and you look inside,</v>

76
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:33.101
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

77
00:03:33.101 --> 00:03:35.320
<v Speaker 1>and then you go home because that's enough for one day.</v>

78
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.960
<v Speaker 1>But you do progressive exposure.</v>

79
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.041
<v Speaker 1>And that's the base.</v>

80
00:03:39.041 --> 00:03:42.340
<v Speaker 1>One of the basic rules of psychotherapy is that if you're afraid of something,</v>

81
00:03:42.341 --> 00:03:45.520
<v Speaker 1>you progressively and voluntarily expose yourself to it.</v>

82
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.360
<v Speaker 1>And that generally it's the voluntary exposure that's curative,</v>

83
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.781
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

84
00:03:49.781 --> 00:03:51.700
<v Speaker 1>Accidental exposure can make you worse,</v>

85
00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:54.010
<v Speaker 1>but voluntary exposure can be curative.</v>

86
00:03:54.011 --> 00:03:58.000
<v Speaker 1>And that's sort of associated with the myth of the hero and the Dragon.</v>

87
00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:58.751
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

88
00:03:58.751 --> 00:04:02.500
<v Speaker 1>the hero is the person who goes out voluntarily to confront the dragon and</v>

89
00:04:02.501 --> 00:04:04.330
<v Speaker 1>overcome it and get the treasurer.</v>

90
00:04:04.331 --> 00:04:08.110
<v Speaker 1>And so if you voluntarily expose yourself to things you're afraid of,</v>

91
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.730
<v Speaker 1>like no more than you can tolerate,</v>

92
00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.560
<v Speaker 1>then you'll find that you get braver and you learn that you can tolerate the</v>

93
00:04:14.561 --> 00:04:16.890
<v Speaker 1>fear and that can chase the or phobia back.</v>

94
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.230
<v Speaker 1>And it's very important to do it on a regular basis.</v>

95
00:04:20.231 --> 00:04:21.830
<v Speaker 1>And if you have agoraphobic,</v>

96
00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.690
<v Speaker 1>a full fledged agoraphobic and you should probably consult professional help</v>

97
00:04:25.691 --> 00:04:28.150
<v Speaker 1>because it's a very tricky condition and it can be very,</v>

98
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:29.950
<v Speaker 1>can really impair you badly.</v>

99
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.160
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I would recommend.</v>

100
00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.930
<v Speaker 1>Hi Jp.</v>

101
00:04:35.931 --> 00:04:39.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm wondering how the computer program that rates university courses as</v>

102
00:04:39.411 --> 00:04:41.840
<v Speaker 1>worthwhile or not is coming along well,</v>

103
00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.000
<v Speaker 1>it isn't rating them as worthwhile.</v>

104
00:04:44.001 --> 00:04:45.560
<v Speaker 1>It's rating them as postmodern,</v>

105
00:04:45.561 --> 00:04:48.380
<v Speaker 1>Neil Marxist or not and it's actually fully developed.</v>

106
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.570
<v Speaker 1>I was going to launch it and I didn't,</v>

107
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:52.190
<v Speaker 1>I didn't design it.</v>

108
00:04:52.191 --> 00:04:52.460
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

109
00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.450
<v Speaker 1>somebody volunteered to design it and presented it to me and it seems to work</v>

110
00:04:56.451 --> 00:04:57.284
<v Speaker 1>very well.</v>

111
00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.890
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

112
00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.700
<v Speaker 1>I was going to launch it at the end of August so that this year's university</v>

113
00:05:01.701 --> 00:05:03.080
<v Speaker 1>students could benefit from it.</v>

114
00:05:03.081 --> 00:05:07.820
<v Speaker 1>But there was the Charlottesville event and then I got busy and I also wasn't</v>

115
00:05:07.821 --> 00:05:12.110
<v Speaker 1>feeling great and so I just didn't hit the window of time properly.</v>

116
00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:17.140
<v Speaker 1>But I hope to be able to launch it for the January incoming class to do a video</v>

117
00:05:17.871 --> 00:05:20.030
<v Speaker 1>about what's wrong with the university system,</v>

118
00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.120
<v Speaker 1>that many things that are wrong with the university system and to launch the</v>

119
00:05:23.121 --> 00:05:24.320
<v Speaker 1>website at the same time.</v>

120
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.160
<v Speaker 1>Also had people suggest to me that maybe it wasn't a good idea that it would</v>

121
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.140
<v Speaker 1>increase polarization,</v>

122
00:05:30.141 --> 00:05:32.960
<v Speaker 1>but I've thought about that for about a month and a half.</v>

123
00:05:32.961 --> 00:05:35.240
<v Speaker 1>And I think that the benefit to the consumer,</v>

124
00:05:35.241 --> 00:05:39.460
<v Speaker 1>so that would be the informed student outweighs any danger of polarization.</v>

125
00:05:39.461 --> 00:05:40.370
<v Speaker 1>And besides that,</v>

126
00:05:40.371 --> 00:05:43.670
<v Speaker 1>something has to be done because the situation in the universities is really</v>

127
00:05:43.671 --> 00:05:44.504
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>

128
00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:45.793
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

129
00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.641
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

130
00:05:47.641 --> 00:05:50.310
<v Speaker 1>so let's see what else we've got here in the chat room.</v>

131
00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.990
<v Speaker 1>D.</v>

132
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:56.990
<v Speaker 1>V.</v>

133
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:56.990
<v Speaker 1>S.</v>

134
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:56.990
<v Speaker 1>S.</v>

135
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:56.990
<v Speaker 1>K.</v>

136
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:56.990
<v Speaker 1>H.</v>

137
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:56.990
<v Speaker 1>E.</v>

138
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.823
<v Speaker 1>R.</v>

139
00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.120
<v Speaker 1>That's quite a mouthful.</v>

140
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:00.770
<v Speaker 1>Says I'm studying to be a teacher,</v>

141
00:06:00.771 --> 00:06:01.940
<v Speaker 1>but I'm also an introvert.</v>

142
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.470
<v Speaker 1>Could this be a big problem?</v>

143
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.540
<v Speaker 1>Can I still be a successful teacher?</v>

144
00:06:05.541 --> 00:06:10.541
<v Speaker 1>Actually what seems to predict success of teaching best is intelligence and</v>

145
00:06:11.571 --> 00:06:12.650
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness.</v>

146
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.150
<v Speaker 1>That's the data so far.</v>

147
00:06:14.151 --> 00:06:15.830
<v Speaker 1>So if you're conscientious,</v>

148
00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.750
<v Speaker 1>then you'll probably be fine.</v>

149
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:22.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean extra introverts have a harder time speaking in front of groups,</v>

150
00:06:22.191 --> 00:06:23.510
<v Speaker 1>but you can learn to do that.</v>

151
00:06:23.511 --> 00:06:23.721
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

152
00:06:23.721 --> 00:06:26.870
<v Speaker 1>an introvert can become a very successful public speaker.</v>

153
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.690
<v Speaker 1>May Not enjoy it the same way that an extrovert might,</v>

154
00:06:29.691 --> 00:06:32.210
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that you can't learn the skills.</v>

155
00:06:32.211 --> 00:06:36.320
<v Speaker 1>And when I would recommend for an introvert is the same thing that I do when I'm</v>

156
00:06:36.321 --> 00:06:38.570
<v Speaker 1>lecturing is I never talked to the whole group.</v>

157
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

158
00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:40.580
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter how big the crowd is,</v>

159
00:06:40.581 --> 00:06:44.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm always picking out individuals in the group and talking specifically to</v>

160
00:06:44.781 --> 00:06:45.050
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

161
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.650
<v Speaker 1>So I'll make a point to an individual and I watched their face and see if</v>

162
00:06:48.651 --> 00:06:50.180
<v Speaker 1>they're nodding and understanding.</v>

163
00:06:50.181 --> 00:06:50.451
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

164
00:06:50.451 --> 00:06:54.170
<v Speaker 1>Because that way you make contact with the entire audience and then you know,</v>

165
00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:56.840
<v Speaker 1>all talk to someone for about 15 seconds or so.</v>

166
00:06:56.841 --> 00:06:58.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to put them on the spot too much.</v>

167
00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.900
<v Speaker 1>And then I shift my attention to someone else and I sort of pinpoint around the</v>

168
00:07:02.901 --> 00:07:06.350
<v Speaker 1>room and that keeps everybody in the room focused on what I'm saying,</v>

169
00:07:06.351 --> 00:07:10.010
<v Speaker 1>because each person reflects the entire crowd back to you.</v>

170
00:07:10.011 --> 00:07:13.490
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say if you're an introvert or if you want to speak in public in</v>

171
00:07:13.491 --> 00:07:14.090
<v Speaker 1>general,</v>

172
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:15.590
<v Speaker 1>forget about the damn crowd.</v>

173
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:16.970
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't exist.</v>

174
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.550
<v Speaker 1>Speak to people one on one at a time.</v>

175
00:07:19.551 --> 00:07:21.410
<v Speaker 1>And an introvert can do that just fine.</v>

176
00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:23.300
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

177
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.320
<v Speaker 1>that's where your strength would be.</v>

178
00:07:25.321 --> 00:07:26.540
<v Speaker 1>And I would say you're,</v>

179
00:07:26.541 --> 00:07:31.490
<v Speaker 1>you're much more likely to be unsuccessful as a teacher if you don't work hard</v>

180
00:07:31.491 --> 00:07:31.850
<v Speaker 1>at it.</v>

181
00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:33.210
<v Speaker 1>And if you're not interested in it.</v>

182
00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.310
<v Speaker 1>So if you're an introvert,</v>

183
00:07:34.311 --> 00:07:35.420
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't worry about that.</v>

184
00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:36.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

185
00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that that'll be the biggest problem that you'll face.</v>

186
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.580
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
