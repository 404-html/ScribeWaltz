1
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.810
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:09.643
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

3
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:13.341
<v Speaker 2>now Jacob,</v>

4
00:00:13.341 --> 00:00:14.930
<v Speaker 2>we get the second part of Jacob's story.</v>

5
00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.790
<v Speaker 2>He goes to meet his uncle Laban and he meets Rachel there again by a well,</v>

6
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:27.470
<v Speaker 2>he falls in love button,</v>

7
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.090
<v Speaker 2>goes to live with Lebanon.</v>

8
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:30.800
<v Speaker 2>There are two daughters there,</v>

9
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.083
<v Speaker 2>Leah,</v>

10
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.320
<v Speaker 2>as well as Rachel.</v>

11
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.340
<v Speaker 2>Leah is not a particularly attractive person.</v>

12
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.200
<v Speaker 2>It isn't exactly clear why,</v>

13
00:00:39.201 --> 00:00:40.880
<v Speaker 2>but the story makes it quite clear.</v>

14
00:00:40.881 --> 00:00:45.881
<v Speaker 2>She's definitely the least desirable of the two daughters and the story makes</v>

15
00:00:46.311 --> 00:00:49.280
<v Speaker 2>reference to her eyes and it isn't clear if there's something wrong with her</v>

16
00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:52.490
<v Speaker 2>physiologically or if there's something wrong with her attitude.</v>

17
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.331
<v Speaker 2>It's not obvious,</v>

18
00:00:53.331 --> 00:00:54.290
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't really matter.</v>

19
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.310
<v Speaker 2>The point is she's the older daughter but she's the less desirable one.</v>

20
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.950
<v Speaker 2>Jacob stays a month,</v>

21
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.420
<v Speaker 2>which is the limit of hospitality in in that time,</v>

22
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.860
<v Speaker 2>if you stayed for a month,</v>

23
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.990
<v Speaker 2>you were welcomed but you had to work for your keep.</v>

24
00:01:08.991 --> 00:01:10.490
<v Speaker 2>I think after about three days,</v>

25
00:01:10.491 --> 00:01:11.211
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>

26
00:01:11.211 --> 00:01:16.211
<v Speaker 2>which seems rather reasonable and so he stays a month and then he has a chat</v>

27
00:01:17.451 --> 00:01:19.230
<v Speaker 2>with Labon and he says he's.</v>

28
00:01:19.231 --> 00:01:21.740
<v Speaker 2>He's fallen in love with Rachel by this time and he says,</v>

29
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.880
<v Speaker 2>I'll stay with you and work for seven years,</v>

30
00:01:25.881 --> 00:01:30.020
<v Speaker 2>and then all we had Rachel and the band says,</v>

31
00:01:30.021 --> 00:01:30.920
<v Speaker 2>that's fine deal,</v>

32
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.280
<v Speaker 2>and then the seven years passes and there's a wedding ceremony.</v>

33
00:01:36.551 --> 00:01:39.230
<v Speaker 2>It's quite a long thing and the bride is veiled and</v>

34
00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.570
<v Speaker 2>the bride goes into the tent with,</v>

35
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.170
<v Speaker 2>with Jacob and if I remember the story correctly,</v>

36
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.120
<v Speaker 2>I haven't looked at it for a month or so.</v>

37
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.240
<v Speaker 2>Rachel is outside the tent speaking,</v>

38
00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.480
<v Speaker 2>but Leah is inside the tent and so Jacob thinks he's getting married to Rachel,</v>

39
00:02:03.241 --> 00:02:06.420
<v Speaker 2>but he's actually getting married to Leah and this is.</v>

40
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.950
<v Speaker 2>It's an inversion a because he's in the dark like Isaac was when he fooled</v>

41
00:02:10.951 --> 00:02:11.784
<v Speaker 2>Isaac.</v>

42
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.100
<v Speaker 2>So now it's Jacobs turned to be in the dark and he gets betrayed by his uncle</v>

43
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.370
<v Speaker 2>and his bride to be Rachel and her sister in a manner that's broadly parallel to</v>

44
00:02:23.371 --> 00:02:25.660
<v Speaker 2>the trip that he pulled on Esau.</v>

45
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.980
<v Speaker 2>And so there is a Karma notion there which I,</v>

46
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.850
<v Speaker 2>which I like,</v>

47
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:30.331
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

48
00:02:30.331 --> 00:02:30.601
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

49
00:02:30.601 --> 00:02:32.100
<v Speaker 2>you might think of Karma as a</v>

50
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.190
<v Speaker 2>superstitious idea,</v>

51
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:36.383
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

52
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.560
<v Speaker 2>And there are ways of interpreting it that might make it the case,</v>

53
00:02:40.561 --> 00:02:42.570
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think that's what it is.</v>

54
00:02:42.571 --> 00:02:47.070
<v Speaker 2>It's that no bad deed goes unpunished at something like that.</v>

55
00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.923
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

56
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.581
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

57
00:02:51.581 --> 00:02:55.570
<v Speaker 2>maybe you've done something bad to someone and therefore there's part of you</v>

58
00:02:55.571 --> 00:02:58.180
<v Speaker 2>that feels quite guilty about that hopefully.</v>

59
00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.570
<v Speaker 2>And that part is looking for punishment to set the stage.</v>

60
00:03:04.871 --> 00:03:05.704
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

61
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:06.671
<v Speaker 2>And you might think,</v>

62
00:03:06.671 --> 00:03:07.300
<v Speaker 2>well no,</v>

63
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.670
<v Speaker 2>but things are,</v>

64
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:10.451
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

65
00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:11.620
<v Speaker 2>unless you're a psychopath,</v>

66
00:03:11.621 --> 00:03:12.730
<v Speaker 2>that's how things work.</v>

67
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.560
<v Speaker 2>If you're interested in that kind of thing,</v>

68
00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:17.830
<v Speaker 2>you should read Dostoyevsky's crime and punishment because it's the definitive</v>

69
00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:19.480
<v Speaker 2>study of that sort of phenomena.</v>

70
00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:20.110
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

71
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.980
<v Speaker 2>Because in that book,</v>

72
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.610
<v Speaker 2>the main protagonists risk,</v>

73
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.520
<v Speaker 2>all Nicole gets away with murder,</v>

74
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.350
<v Speaker 2>like he does it successfully.</v>

75
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:27.940
<v Speaker 2>No one suspects him.</v>

76
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.240
<v Speaker 2>And he drives himself so crazy with guilt that he basically falls into the hands</v>

77
00:03:34.211 --> 00:03:34.661
<v Speaker 2>of the police.</v>

78
00:03:34.661 --> 00:03:38.980
<v Speaker 2>He drives himself into the hands of the police because he can't tolerate what he</v>

79
00:03:38.981 --> 00:03:39.700
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>

80
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:40.181
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>

81
00:03:40.181 --> 00:03:40.811
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>

82
00:03:40.811 --> 00:03:41.920
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing book.</v>

83
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.581
<v Speaker 2>But anyways,</v>

84
00:03:42.581 --> 00:03:43.414
<v Speaker 2>the point is here,</v>

85
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.250
<v Speaker 2>Jacob falls prey to the same sort of crookedness that he used to ratchet himself</v>

86
00:03:51.821 --> 00:03:56.821
<v Speaker 2>up the ladder and that happens far more often in life than people think.</v>

87
00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.000
<v Speaker 2>And it's really not like he can complain about it right now if he has any sense.</v>

88
00:04:01.001 --> 00:04:01.840
<v Speaker 2>It's like he does.</v>

89
00:04:01.841 --> 00:04:05.770
<v Speaker 2>He brings Leah out to see Labon and he says,</v>

90
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:07.593
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>

91
00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.340
<v Speaker 2>what's with this sister?</v>

92
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:10.140
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

93
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.220
<v Speaker 2>And Lebaron basically says to him</v>

94
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:15.160
<v Speaker 2>in our culture,</v>

95
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.450
<v Speaker 2>it's the custom to marry the eldest daughter first,</v>

96
00:04:19.451 --> 00:04:20.830
<v Speaker 2>which is exactly right.</v>

97
00:04:20.831 --> 00:04:21.251
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

98
00:04:21.251 --> 00:04:21.491
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

99
00:04:21.491 --> 00:04:22.324
<v Speaker 2>it would bring,</v>

100
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

101
00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.070
<v Speaker 2>he's rationalizing obviously because he's just screwed over Jacob in a major</v>

102
00:04:27.071 --> 00:04:27.790
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

103
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.120
<v Speaker 2>but it's a little late to take it back.</v>

104
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.310
<v Speaker 2>The marriage has been consummated and the ceremony has been complete and all</v>

105
00:04:36.311 --> 00:04:41.311
<v Speaker 2>hell would break out if there was any attempt to sever the relationship.</v>

106
00:04:41.431 --> 00:04:43.930
<v Speaker 2>So that's how it is.</v>

107
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.550
<v Speaker 2>So Leah's married and Jacob has the wrong wife.</v>

108
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.073
<v Speaker 2>So then,</v>

109
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.240
<v Speaker 2>so this is Jacob there you see on the left he's got the little flowery hat and</v>

110
00:04:55.241 --> 00:04:57.820
<v Speaker 2>he's pointing to Leah and he's saying like,</v>

111
00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:58.540
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

112
00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:59.470
<v Speaker 2>What's up here?</v>

113
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.680
<v Speaker 2>And loved the band,</v>

114
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:06.101
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

115
00:05:06.101 --> 00:05:10.330
<v Speaker 2>La Banda is coupled goat and he's not really all that sad about it.</v>

116
00:05:10.331 --> 00:05:10.691
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

117
00:05:10.691 --> 00:05:12.000
<v Speaker 2>you can imagine that he's going to go in,</v>

118
00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:15.940
<v Speaker 2>so okay.</v>

119
00:05:15.941 --> 00:05:17.800
<v Speaker 2>Then he asked to work another seven years</v>

120
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.880
<v Speaker 2>and he gains Rachel.</v>

121
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.060
<v Speaker 2>But because God is a tricky character,</v>

122
00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.880
<v Speaker 2>there was another twist in this story.</v>

123
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.750
<v Speaker 2>Rachel turns out not to be very good at having children or Rachel and Jacob</v>

124
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.490
<v Speaker 2>turned out not to be very good in having children,</v>

125
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:37.600
<v Speaker 2>but Leah,</v>

126
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.180
<v Speaker 2>she's really good at having kids,</v>

127
00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.730
<v Speaker 2>so she provides Jacob with Reuben,</v>

128
00:05:45.731 --> 00:05:46.450
<v Speaker 2>simeon,</v>

129
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:47.283
<v Speaker 2>Levi,</v>

130
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:47.980
<v Speaker 2>Levi,</v>

131
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.360
<v Speaker 2>believe and Judah.</v>

132
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.870
<v Speaker 2>And the names of those meanings of those names are there.</v>

133
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.460
<v Speaker 2>Reuben means see a son.</v>

134
00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.380
<v Speaker 2>Simeon means hearing the.</v>

135
00:05:56.381 --> 00:05:58.250
<v Speaker 2>I think that was the Lord heard my prayer.</v>

136
00:05:58.251 --> 00:05:59.390
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what that was.</v>

137
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.190
<v Speaker 2>Levi means joined.</v>

138
00:06:01.191 --> 00:06:02.240
<v Speaker 2>Judah means praise too.</v>

139
00:06:02.241 --> 00:06:02.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

140
00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:03.413
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

141
00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.750
<v Speaker 2>and it's Judah from WHO's tried Christ arises.</v>

142
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.240
<v Speaker 2>Judah is essentially promoted to the status of first born.</v>

143
00:06:11.241 --> 00:06:12.260
<v Speaker 2>Later in the story.</v>

144
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.390
<v Speaker 2>This is important because Ruben,</v>

145
00:06:14.391 --> 00:06:19.391
<v Speaker 2>simeon and Levy all do something reprehensible and so Judah gets,</v>

146
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.760
<v Speaker 2>gets promoted to firstborn,</v>

147
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:28.870
<v Speaker 2>and that's partly why in the logic of the narrative that it's from the tribe of</v>

148
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.220
<v Speaker 2>Judah that Christ arises,</v>

149
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:32.563
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

150
00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.350
<v Speaker 2>so now while this is going on,</v>

151
00:06:36.351 --> 00:06:38.030
<v Speaker 2>Rachel is like suicidal,</v>

152
00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:39.070
<v Speaker 2>desperate for children's.</v>

153
00:06:39.071 --> 00:06:43.100
<v Speaker 2>She's jealous of her older sister who's rather ill favored as we pointed out,</v>

154
00:06:43.101 --> 00:06:48.101
<v Speaker 2>but who seems to be damn good at producing sons and she's really not happy with</v>

155
00:06:49.371 --> 00:06:49.851
<v Speaker 2>Jacob,</v>

156
00:06:49.851 --> 00:06:52.860
<v Speaker 2>and so she chose him out and Jacob basically says like,</v>

157
00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:53.960
<v Speaker 2>what do you want me to do about it?</v>

158
00:06:53.961 --> 00:06:54.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm not God,</v>

159
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:57.470
<v Speaker 2>which is a reasonable response I would say,</v>

160
00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.240
<v Speaker 2>and so in her desperation she gives Jacob Bella,</v>

161
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.040
<v Speaker 2>who's her maid servant.</v>

162
00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.730
<v Speaker 2>We've seen that sort of thing happened before and</v>

163
00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.480
<v Speaker 2>to bill up produces two children.</v>

164
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.900
<v Speaker 2>Dan and NAF telly.</v>

165
00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:16.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm the reason I'm detailing out all these sons.</v>

166
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:21.160
<v Speaker 2>It's important because Jacob is the founder of Israel and his sons are the</v>

167
00:07:21.501 --> 00:07:23.120
<v Speaker 2>founder of the 12 tribes,</v>

168
00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.300
<v Speaker 2>so it's a pivotal moment in the story,</v>

169
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:26.601
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

170
00:07:26.601 --> 00:07:27.740
<v Speaker 2>It's because he's the.</v>

171
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.320
<v Speaker 2>He's the fundamental patriarch of,</v>

172
00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.830
<v Speaker 2>of those who wrestle with God because as we'll see,</v>

173
00:07:33.831 --> 00:07:35.360
<v Speaker 2>that's what the name Israel means.</v>

174
00:07:35.361 --> 00:07:36.650
<v Speaker 2>He gets the name Israel.</v>

175
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:38.360
<v Speaker 2>You'll see why in a while,</v>

176
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:39.463
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

177
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:40.363
<v Speaker 2>but it's in the,</v>

178
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:44.630
<v Speaker 2>you need to know these genealogies in this situation because they play an</v>

179
00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:47.300
<v Speaker 2>important role in everything that happens afterwards.</v>

180
00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:48.613
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

181
00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:52.460
<v Speaker 2>Naftali is the second</v>

182
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:56.690
<v Speaker 2>and her name or his name means with great wrestling's.</v>

183
00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:58.100
<v Speaker 2>I've wrestled with my sister,</v>

184
00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:58.521
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

185
00:07:58.521 --> 00:08:00.800
<v Speaker 2>contended with her and have prevailed.</v>

186
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:05.900
<v Speaker 2>So that gives you some indication of the tension in the household.</v>

187
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:09.470
<v Speaker 2>Now Leah is now past bearing children.</v>

188
00:08:09.471 --> 00:08:10.191
<v Speaker 2>She gives Jake,</v>

189
00:08:10.191 --> 00:08:10.551
<v Speaker 2>Jacob,</v>

190
00:08:10.551 --> 00:08:15.200
<v Speaker 2>her maid servant Zilpah to keep up with her sister,</v>

191
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.393
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

192
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:17.383
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

193
00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:22.350
<v Speaker 2>now Zilpah bears to children for Jacob.</v>

194
00:08:22.351 --> 00:08:25.550
<v Speaker 2>So he's piling up the kids left right and center here.</v>

195
00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:26.693
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

196
00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.280
<v Speaker 2>one of them is named Gad,</v>

197
00:08:28.281 --> 00:08:28.941
<v Speaker 2>good fortune.</v>

198
00:08:28.941 --> 00:08:30.320
<v Speaker 2>And the other is named Asher.</v>

199
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:31.520
<v Speaker 2>Happy or blessed.</v>

200
00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:36.290
<v Speaker 2>So there's more rivalry going on between the sisters.</v>

201
00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:38.450
<v Speaker 2>This is quite an interesting little story.</v>

202
00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:39.410
<v Speaker 2>So Ruben,</v>

203
00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:41.300
<v Speaker 2>who's Leah's daughter,</v>

204
00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.630
<v Speaker 2>goes out and looks for mandrakes.</v>

205
00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.300
<v Speaker 2>Now mandrakes have aphrodisiac property.</v>

206
00:08:47.301 --> 00:08:49.160
<v Speaker 2>So that's a little odd to begin with,</v>

207
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.810
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't matter.</v>

208
00:08:50.811 --> 00:08:51.710
<v Speaker 2>That's what happens.</v>

209
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:52.573
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

210
00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:54.830
<v Speaker 2>Rachel is,</v>

211
00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.700
<v Speaker 2>Rachel wants the mandrakes because she's still interested in having some</v>

212
00:08:59.701 --> 00:09:04.380
<v Speaker 2>children and so she bargains with Leah to give her a night with Jacob in</v>

213
00:09:04.381 --> 00:09:09.381
<v Speaker 2>exchange for the mandrakes and a more sons emerge as a consequence of that.</v>

214
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:11.843
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

215
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:14.400
<v Speaker 2>and Rachel find the gifts,</v>

216
00:09:14.401 --> 00:09:19.401
<v Speaker 2>birth Joseph and Joseph plays a key role in the last story in Genesis,</v>

217
00:09:21.751 --> 00:09:24.720
<v Speaker 2>which I hope we'll get to in the next lecture.</v>

218
00:09:24.721 --> 00:09:26.790
<v Speaker 2>And then we can close off genesis.</v>

219
00:09:26.791 --> 00:09:27.601
<v Speaker 2>That's the plan.</v>

220
00:09:27.601 --> 00:09:28.434
<v Speaker 2>Anyways.</v>

221
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:33.920
<v Speaker 2>So now Jacob isn't really very happy about the whole arrangement because he,</v>

222
00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.230
<v Speaker 2>he's been there 14 years and he's got two wives.</v>

223
00:09:37.231 --> 00:09:37.981
<v Speaker 2>It's not too bad,</v>

224
00:09:37.981 --> 00:09:38.600
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>

225
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:38.851
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

226
00:09:38.851 --> 00:09:41.760
<v Speaker 2>he got the bargain wasn't exactly clean.</v>

227
00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:45.900
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't really trust law bannon and there's no reason for him to do so.</v>

228
00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.980
<v Speaker 2>Lebanon was poor before Jacob came.</v>

229
00:09:49.981 --> 00:09:54.240
<v Speaker 2>Jacob turns out to be a very useful person to have around.</v>

230
00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:59.160
<v Speaker 2>And so he tells labounty he wants to leave and go back to his home country and</v>

231
00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:01.830
<v Speaker 2>that he'll take the speckled and spotted cattle,</v>

232
00:10:01.831 --> 00:10:02.730
<v Speaker 2>the brown sheep.</v>

233
00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:05.490
<v Speaker 2>And the spotted and speckled goats from the flock,</v>

234
00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:06.810
<v Speaker 2>and they're in the minority.</v>

235
00:10:06.811 --> 00:10:07.860
<v Speaker 2>So that's the idea.</v>

236
00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:12.750
<v Speaker 2>And so ban or lab and takes all those animals out of his flock.</v>

237
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:13.460
<v Speaker 2>So the.</v>

238
00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:18.210
<v Speaker 2>There was an idea that the speckled goats and the brown sheep would breed true.</v>

239
00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:23.270
<v Speaker 2>So if you have two male goat and a female goat and they're both speckled,</v>

240
00:10:24.061 --> 00:10:25.140
<v Speaker 2>they'll have speckled kits.</v>

241
00:10:25.141 --> 00:10:25.951
<v Speaker 2>That's the theory.</v>

242
00:10:25.951 --> 00:10:27.660
<v Speaker 2>And the same with brown sheep.</v>

243
00:10:27.661 --> 00:10:32.220
<v Speaker 2>And so what [inaudible] does is he takes all the speckled animals out of the</v>

244
00:10:32.221 --> 00:10:33.054
<v Speaker 2>flocks,</v>

245
00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:34.230
<v Speaker 2>gives them to his son,</v>

246
00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:38.370
<v Speaker 2>and they go three days away with them so that Jacob is left with the flock.</v>

247
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.480
<v Speaker 2>But with no,</v>

248
00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:41.010
<v Speaker 2>with none of these animals.</v>

249
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:43.170
<v Speaker 2>Now the idea was that all the one newborns,</v>

250
00:10:43.171 --> 00:10:44.130
<v Speaker 2>we're going to be his.</v>

251
00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:49.370
<v Speaker 2>And so what Liban is basically done is set it up so that in principle I'm Jacob</v>

252
00:10:49.681 --> 00:10:51.210
<v Speaker 2>is going to get nothing for his work.</v>

253
00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:56.520
<v Speaker 2>So that's another time when Jacob experiences betrayal.</v>

254
00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:57.271
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

255
00:10:57.271 --> 00:11:02.220
<v Speaker 2>it's almost as if God isn't done with reminding him of the magnitude of what he</v>

256
00:11:02.221 --> 00:11:03.060
<v Speaker 2>did in the past.</v>

257
00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:05.430
<v Speaker 2>That that's the moral of the story.</v>

258
00:11:05.431 --> 00:11:06.264
<v Speaker 2>In some sense,</v>

259
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.760
<v Speaker 2>now there's a weird little twist in the story here.</v>

260
00:11:08.761 --> 00:11:13.740
<v Speaker 2>So what Jacob does is some sympathetic magic and so when the animals are</v>

261
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:14.633
<v Speaker 2>rotting,</v>

262
00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:17.130
<v Speaker 2>he puts speckled objects in front of them,</v>

263
00:11:17.131 --> 00:11:18.780
<v Speaker 2>speckled branches and so forth,</v>

264
00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:21.900
<v Speaker 2>I guess to remind them about what they're supposed to be producing,</v>

265
00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.130
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

266
00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:24.091
<v Speaker 2>And it works.</v>

267
00:11:24.091 --> 00:11:27.150
<v Speaker 2>And so all these animals that laband left are,</v>

268
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:27.841
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

269
00:11:27.841 --> 00:11:28.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

270
00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:30.630
<v Speaker 2>producing spotted animals like mad.</v>

271
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:31.790
<v Speaker 2>And so that's,</v>

272
00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:37.070
<v Speaker 2>I guess God's changed his mind and let Jacob off the hook slightly here.</v>

273
00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:40.320
<v Speaker 2>So Sooni was very wealthy,</v>

274
00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:42.590
<v Speaker 2>much cattle maid servants,</v>

275
00:11:42.591 --> 00:11:43.231
<v Speaker 2>men servants,</v>

276
00:11:43.231 --> 00:11:44.400
<v Speaker 2>Campbell's analysis,</v>

277
00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:45.360
<v Speaker 2>laband son,</v>

278
00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.070
<v Speaker 2>sons become jealous.</v>

279
00:11:47.071 --> 00:11:48.270
<v Speaker 2>And lavonne is outraged.</v>

280
00:11:48.271 --> 00:11:48.600
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

281
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:48.931
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

282
00:11:48.931 --> 00:11:51.750
<v Speaker 2>obviously there's some competition there between Jacob and his sons,</v>

283
00:11:51.751 --> 00:11:52.950
<v Speaker 2>which is hardly surprising.</v>

284
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:57.640
<v Speaker 2>And the band played this trick to strip Jacob of all his property and instead he</v>

285
00:11:57.641 --> 00:11:59.740
<v Speaker 2>got far more than he was going to get to begin with.</v>

286
00:11:59.741 --> 00:12:01.870
<v Speaker 2>So you can imagine that spirit a bit annoying.</v>

287
00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:02.741
<v Speaker 2>So Jacob,</v>

288
00:12:02.741 --> 00:12:03.011
<v Speaker 2>thanks.</v>

289
00:12:03.011 --> 00:12:04.030
<v Speaker 2>He better get out of there.</v>

290
00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:07.810
<v Speaker 2>So we tell Rachel and Leah and said unto them,</v>

291
00:12:07.811 --> 00:12:11.440
<v Speaker 2>I see your father's countenance that it's not toward me as before.</v>

292
00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.560
<v Speaker 2>But the god of my father has been with me and you know,</v>

293
00:12:14.561 --> 00:12:15.430
<v Speaker 2>with all my power,</v>

294
00:12:15.431 --> 00:12:19.300
<v Speaker 2>I've served your father and your father is deceived me and changed my wages 10</v>

295
00:12:19.301 --> 00:12:20.110
<v Speaker 2>times,</v>

296
00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:23.920
<v Speaker 2>but God so far has suffered him not to hurt me if he said,</v>

297
00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:26.530
<v Speaker 2>thus the speckled shall be thy wages,</v>

298
00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:28.540
<v Speaker 2>then all the cattle bore speckled,</v>

299
00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:29.411
<v Speaker 2>and if he said,</v>

300
00:12:29.411 --> 00:12:33.300
<v Speaker 2>thus the ring straight shall be thy higher than all the cattle board ring</v>

301
00:12:33.301 --> 00:12:34.000
<v Speaker 2>strict.</v>

302
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.800
<v Speaker 2>Thus God has taken away the cattle of your father and given them to me and they</v>

303
00:12:38.801 --> 00:12:42.930
<v Speaker 2>decided to sneak away and they're unhappy with the inheritance.</v>

304
00:12:42.931 --> 00:12:44.380
<v Speaker 2>That lack of inheritance from Lebanon.</v>

305
00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:45.670
<v Speaker 2>So as they sneak away,</v>

306
00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:50.940
<v Speaker 2>Rachel steals the idols that her father has in his house and it's not exactly</v>

307
00:12:51.311 --> 00:12:52.300
<v Speaker 2>obvious why.</v>

308
00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:54.970
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of contention about why she's doing that.</v>

309
00:12:54.971 --> 00:12:56.710
<v Speaker 2>Some of them is to punish him,</v>

310
00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:00.010
<v Speaker 2>to bring with her the images of her ancestors.</v>

311
00:13:00.011 --> 00:13:00.221
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

312
00:13:00.221 --> 00:13:02.260
<v Speaker 2>maybe she's loaned some moving away from home,</v>

313
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:07.240
<v Speaker 2>just out of spite to show them that the idols were actually powerless for</v>

314
00:13:07.241 --> 00:13:08.074
<v Speaker 2>protection,</v>

315
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:11.290
<v Speaker 2>to stop her father from dividing the root of their escape.</v>

316
00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:15.360
<v Speaker 2>That last one is the strangest one because the idea would be that the ban would</v>

317
00:13:15.361 --> 00:13:20.361
<v Speaker 2>have used some sort of ritual with the idols that would help them infer their</v>

318
00:13:21.401 --> 00:13:23.050
<v Speaker 2>escape route and then could chase them.</v>

319
00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:23.741
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

320
00:13:23.741 --> 00:13:25.900
<v Speaker 2>that's the range of speculation about that.</v>

321
00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:31.140
<v Speaker 2>I think it sounds to me mostly like a little act of revenge maybe with a bit of</v>

322
00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:36.340
<v Speaker 2>loneliness mixed in laband pursues them,</v>

323
00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:40.390
<v Speaker 2>but God comes into dream to tell him to leave Jacob unharmed.</v>

324
00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:44.620
<v Speaker 2>Lavonne catches up with them in reproaches Jacob saying that he would have</v>

325
00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:48.820
<v Speaker 2>thrown a great party if he would have known that they were going to leave,</v>

326
00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:49.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

327
00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.040
<v Speaker 2>he didn't want them to sneak away in the night.</v>

328
00:13:51.041 --> 00:13:54.160
<v Speaker 2>And you can't tell from the story whether that's true or not.</v>

329
00:13:54.161 --> 00:13:54.790
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

330
00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:58.640
<v Speaker 2>these people were pretty rough and impulsive I would say.</v>

331
00:13:58.641 --> 00:14:02.680
<v Speaker 2>And maybe there is a 50 percent chance of a slaughter and a 50 percent chance of</v>

332
00:14:02.681 --> 00:14:03.460
<v Speaker 2>a party.</v>

333
00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:04.210
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>

334
00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:06.040
<v Speaker 2>I've been to parties like that actually.</v>

335
00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:07.443
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

336
00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:13.270
<v Speaker 2>laband complains that his gods are gone and Jacob says that whoever has them,</v>

337
00:14:13.271 --> 00:14:14.590
<v Speaker 2>he will have them killed.</v>

338
00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:15.761
<v Speaker 2>And Rachel,</v>

339
00:14:15.761 --> 00:14:18.040
<v Speaker 2>who's really quite a sneaky character,</v>

340
00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:23.190
<v Speaker 2>all things consider basically claims that she's having her period and she's</v>

341
00:14:23.471 --> 00:14:28.471
<v Speaker 2>sitting on the carpet with all the idols underneath and she can't move.</v>

342
00:14:28.721 --> 00:14:30.640
<v Speaker 2>And so they search everywhere and can't find them.</v>

343
00:14:30.641 --> 00:14:35.380
<v Speaker 2>And she's like laughing away behind her hand about that sneaky little maneuver.</v>

344
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:36.590
<v Speaker 2>But she,</v>

345
00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:37.511
<v Speaker 2>she doesn't die.</v>

346
00:14:37.511 --> 00:14:38.980
<v Speaker 2>So that's probably a good thing.</v>

347
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.040
<v Speaker 2>So the laband,</v>

348
00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:43.570
<v Speaker 2>she checks everything out,</v>

349
00:14:43.571 --> 00:14:45.490
<v Speaker 2>checks the camp out and he can't find anything.</v>

350
00:14:45.491 --> 00:14:47.050
<v Speaker 2>So they reconcile.</v>

351
00:14:47.051 --> 00:14:51.750
<v Speaker 2>And so that's the first reconciliation that Jacob in.</v>

352
00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:52.670
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of like</v>

353
00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:54.553
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

354
00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:01.170
<v Speaker 2>what would you say the Karmic debt has been paid.</v>

355
00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:02.610
<v Speaker 2>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>

356
00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:06.420
<v Speaker 2>That's so he got punished for his wrongdoing.</v>

357
00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:09.330
<v Speaker 2>He's learned his lesson perhaps.</v>

358
00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:11.423
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

359
00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:12.373
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

360
00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:13.431
<v Speaker 2>that's good enough.</v>

361
00:15:13.431 --> 00:15:14.510
<v Speaker 2>As far as he's concerned,</v>

362
00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:17.270
<v Speaker 2>he got away good enough and they make peace.</v>

363
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:18.583
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

364
00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:25.740
<v Speaker 2>then the next thing that happens as they're traveling is that Jacob was left</v>

365
00:15:25.741 --> 00:15:27.780
<v Speaker 2>alone and there wrestled a man,</v>

366
00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:29.550
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

367
00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:30.180
<v Speaker 2>Angel.</v>

368
00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:30.960
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

369
00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.040
<v Speaker 2>it's not clear.</v>

370
00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:38.430
<v Speaker 2>We'll go with angel with him until the breaking of the day or God.</v>

371
00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:40.890
<v Speaker 2>And when he saw that he prevailed not against him,</v>

372
00:15:40.891 --> 00:15:44.160
<v Speaker 2>he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of</v>

373
00:15:44.161 --> 00:15:46.170
<v Speaker 2>joint as he wrestled with him and he said,</v>

374
00:15:46.171 --> 00:15:47.840
<v Speaker 2>let me go for the day breaks.</v>

375
00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:48.931
<v Speaker 2>And Jacob said,</v>

376
00:15:48.931 --> 00:15:50.910
<v Speaker 2>I will not let you go unless you bless me.</v>

377
00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:52.800
<v Speaker 2>And the Angel said unto him,</v>

378
00:15:52.801 --> 00:15:53.670
<v Speaker 2>what is the name?</v>

379
00:15:53.671 --> 00:15:54.990
<v Speaker 2>And Jacob said,</v>

380
00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:56.063
<v Speaker 2>Jacob.</v>

381
00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:07.831
<v Speaker 2>And the Angel said,</v>

382
00:16:07.831 --> 00:16:10.470
<v Speaker 2>thy name shall no more be called Jacob.</v>

383
00:16:10.471 --> 00:16:11.950
<v Speaker 2>So the supplanter right,</v>

384
00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:17.330
<v Speaker 2>the overthrow her with that kind of intonation of or implication of crookedness</v>

385
00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.073
<v Speaker 2>but Israel,</v>

386
00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:24.200
<v Speaker 2>which means he who wrestles or strive successfully with God for as a prince,</v>

387
00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:27.930
<v Speaker 2>hast thou power with God and with men and has prevailed.</v>

388
00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:29.460
<v Speaker 2>That's quite a story.</v>

389
00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:30.533
<v Speaker 2>Like it's.</v>

390
00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:31.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

391
00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:32.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't know exactly what to make of it.</v>

392
00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:36.030
<v Speaker 2>There's obviously a symbolic level of meaning,</v>

393
00:16:36.031 --> 00:16:40.470
<v Speaker 2>which is that that is what human beings do in some senses they,</v>

394
00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:41.700
<v Speaker 2>they wrestle.</v>

395
00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:46.320
<v Speaker 2>I would say they wrestle with the divine even with the concept of the divine for</v>

396
00:16:46.321 --> 00:16:47.154
<v Speaker 2>that matter.</v>

397
00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:48.353
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

398
00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:51.620
<v Speaker 2>but the question is,</v>

399
00:16:51.621 --> 00:16:52.700
<v Speaker 2>do they prevail?</v>

400
00:16:52.701 --> 00:16:57.230
<v Speaker 2>Like it's kind of odd thing that Jacob actually seems to win this battle,</v>

401
00:16:57.231 --> 00:16:57.411
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

402
00:16:57.411 --> 00:17:02.090
<v Speaker 2>Or at least he wins it enough so that whoever he's wrestling this divine figure</v>

403
00:17:02.091 --> 00:17:05.030
<v Speaker 2>that he's wrestling is willing to bestow a blessing on him.</v>

404
00:17:05.031 --> 00:17:07.760
<v Speaker 2>I guess maybe that's a testament to his courage.</v>

405
00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:08.930
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>

406
00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:14.170
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's an indication that he has paid for his sin sufficiently so that he</v>

407
00:17:14.541 --> 00:17:16.610
<v Speaker 2>sort of back on the moral high ground.</v>

408
00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:17.743
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

409
00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:23.050
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's really telling that the transformation of the name from Jacob</v>

410
00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:28.090
<v Speaker 2>Israel and what Israel means is he who wrestles with God or who struggles with</v>

411
00:17:28.611 --> 00:17:30.170
<v Speaker 2>God and perhaps successfully,</v>

412
00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:34.580
<v Speaker 2>but it's also so interesting that he actually emerges victorious.</v>

413
00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:35.271
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

414
00:17:35.271 --> 00:17:37.700
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't necessarily think that that would be a possibility,</v>

415
00:17:37.701 --> 00:17:39.350
<v Speaker 2>especially given you know,</v>

416
00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:42.320
<v Speaker 2>God's rather hot headed nature in the Old Testament.</v>

417
00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:44.210
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to mess with him too much,</v>

418
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:45.260
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

419
00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:46.850
<v Speaker 2>but Jacob does it successfully.</v>

420
00:17:46.851 --> 00:17:51.851
<v Speaker 2>But even more importantly is the idea that whatever Israel constitutes,</v>

421
00:17:52.321 --> 00:17:53.101
<v Speaker 2>which would be the say,</v>

422
00:17:53.101 --> 00:17:58.101
<v Speaker 2>the land that Jacob phones is actually composed of those who wrestle with God.</v>

423
00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:04.460
<v Speaker 2>I think that's an amazing idea because it also seems to me to shed some light on</v>

424
00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:08.820
<v Speaker 2>perhaps what was meant by belief in those days.</v>

425
00:18:08.821 --> 00:18:09.380
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

426
00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:12.690
<v Speaker 2>like I've often thought of rep of marriage as a wrestling match,</v>

427
00:18:12.691 --> 00:18:13.170
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

428
00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:13.861
<v Speaker 2>If you're lucky,</v>

429
00:18:13.861 --> 00:18:15.020
<v Speaker 2>the person that you marry,</v>

430
00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:16.440
<v Speaker 2>someone you contend with,</v>

431
00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:17.760
<v Speaker 2>it's not exactly.</v>

432
00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:19.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's exactly.</v>

433
00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:20.910
<v Speaker 2>It's not tranquil.</v>

434
00:18:20.911 --> 00:18:21.744
<v Speaker 2>Precisely.</v>

435
00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:23.280
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

436
00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:25.500
<v Speaker 2>you might have noticed that some of you and,</v>

437
00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:26.830
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

438
00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:29.940
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is if you have something to contend against,</v>

439
00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:35.210
<v Speaker 2>then that strengthens you and that's actually better than having nothing to</v>

440
00:18:35.371 --> 00:18:36.360
<v Speaker 2>contend against.</v>

441
00:18:36.361 --> 00:18:41.361
<v Speaker 2>And so Jacob is the person who's also strengthened by the necessity of this</v>

442
00:18:42.451 --> 00:18:47.451
<v Speaker 2>contending and that seems to be the proper relationship with God or the angel is</v>

443
00:18:47.761 --> 00:18:50.010
<v Speaker 2>that contending the battling,</v>

444
00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:50.730
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

445
00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:54.510
<v Speaker 2>Rather than some sort of kind of loose,</v>

446
00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:57.300
<v Speaker 2>weak statement of belief.</v>

447
00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:58.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

448
00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to denigrate that to any great degree.</v>

449
00:19:00.601 --> 00:19:03.990
<v Speaker 2>It just doesn't seem like the right motive conceptualization,</v>

450
00:19:03.991 --> 00:19:04.201
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

451
00:19:04.201 --> 00:19:05.310
<v Speaker 2>Because human beings aren't,</v>

452
00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:10.910
<v Speaker 2>aren't like that were were contentious creatures and that's actually seems to be</v>

453
00:19:11.791 --> 00:19:14.400
<v Speaker 2>something that meets with God's favor in this situation.</v>

454
00:19:14.401 --> 00:19:18.660
<v Speaker 2>So especially given that that's actually what he names the while the whole</v>

455
00:19:18.661 --> 00:19:23.661
<v Speaker 2>kingdom of the chosen people is the idea is that that's composed of those who</v>

456
00:19:23.731 --> 00:19:25.530
<v Speaker 2>contend with God.</v>

457
00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:27.030
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

458
00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:29.460
<v Speaker 2>that's a hell of an idea that that's for sure.</v>

459
00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:32.490
<v Speaker 2>And Jacob asked</v>

460
00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:34.651
<v Speaker 2>him and said,</v>

461
00:19:34.651 --> 00:19:36.330
<v Speaker 2>tell me I pray thee thy name.</v>

462
00:19:36.331 --> 00:19:37.164
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

463
00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:39.870
<v Speaker 2>wherefore dos ask after by name.</v>

464
00:19:39.871 --> 00:19:41.370
<v Speaker 2>So there's no that's not happening.</v>

465
00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:42.570
<v Speaker 2>And he blessed him there.</v>

466
00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.060
<v Speaker 2>And Jacob called the place of the name of that place.</v>

467
00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:49.710
<v Speaker 2>Penile for I or Peniel for I have seen God face to face in my life is preserved.</v>

468
00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.320
<v Speaker 2>And he passed over penile.</v>

469
00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:54.720
<v Speaker 2>The Sun rose upon him and he halted upon his thigh.</v>

470
00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:59.790
<v Speaker 2>Now Jacob does walk away injured from this,</v>

471
00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:00.601
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

472
00:20:00.601 --> 00:20:02.400
<v Speaker 2>So he has a permanent limp after that.</v>

473
00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:07.230
<v Speaker 2>And so that's also an indication of just how dangerous that contention actually</v>

474
00:20:07.231 --> 00:20:07.860
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

475
00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:08.880
<v Speaker 2>Like he gets blast,</v>

476
00:20:08.881 --> 00:20:09.331
<v Speaker 2>he wins,</v>

477
00:20:09.331 --> 00:20:11.100
<v Speaker 2>but he doesn't get away Scot free.</v>
