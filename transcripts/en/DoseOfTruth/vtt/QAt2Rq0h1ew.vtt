00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.850
<v Speaker 1>So then the first question was,</v>

2
00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.470
<v Speaker 1>why are these Marxists motivated by love or hatred?</v>

3
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:15.723
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.790
<v Speaker 1>is it love or hatred that produces a hundred million dead people?</v>

5
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.790
<v Speaker 1>Is that enough evidence or not?</v>

6
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:27.980
<v Speaker 1>And if it's not enough evidence,</v>

7
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.030
<v Speaker 1>if you think to yourself,</v>

8
00:00:29.031 --> 00:00:30.380
<v Speaker 1>well that's not enough evidence.</v>

9
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.960
<v Speaker 1>It was never really given its proper,</v>

10
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.040
<v Speaker 1>a proper try.</v>

11
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.971
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

12
00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:40.130
<v Speaker 1>well why would it be in proper try?</v>

13
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.211
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

14
00:00:41.211 --> 00:00:42.890
<v Speaker 1>I always think when I hear someone say that,</v>

15
00:00:42.891 --> 00:00:44.060
<v Speaker 1>I know what you think.</v>

16
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.630
<v Speaker 1>You think in your delusional arrogance,</v>

17
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.550
<v Speaker 1>did you understand the Marxist doctrines better than anyone else ever has?</v>

18
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.700
<v Speaker 1>And that if you were the one implementing those doctrines,</v>

19
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.430
<v Speaker 1>you would have ushered in the utopia.</v>

20
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.580
<v Speaker 1>That's what you mean when you say that.</v>

21
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.863
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

22
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:06.270
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

23
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.710
<v Speaker 1>they say there's an idea in the new testament that there's a sin.</v>

24
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.420
<v Speaker 1>It's a sin against the holy ghost.</v>

25
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.460
<v Speaker 1>If you commit that sand,</v>

26
00:01:13.461 --> 00:01:14.810
<v Speaker 1>no one really knows what it is,</v>

27
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.240
<v Speaker 1>that you can't be forgiven.</v>

28
00:01:18.241 --> 00:01:18.811
<v Speaker 1>And I would say,</v>

29
00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:19.644
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

30
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.330
<v Speaker 1>if you want a candidate for the sin against the Holy Ghost and the 21st century,</v>

31
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:25.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

32
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.430
<v Speaker 1>the statement</v>

33
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.590
<v Speaker 1>communism,</v>

34
00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:30.640
<v Speaker 1>real communism,</v>

35
00:01:30.641 --> 00:01:35.410
<v Speaker 1>was never tried with the underlying idea that if you had been the person</v>

36
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.850
<v Speaker 1>implementing it would have worked.</v>

37
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.040
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a pretty good contender for something for which you should never</v>

38
00:01:42.041 --> 00:01:42.874
<v Speaker 1>be forgiven.</v>

39
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.993
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

40
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.701
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

41
00:01:47.701 --> 00:01:48.810
<v Speaker 1>so that's Marxism.</v>

42
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.030
<v Speaker 1>So let's go on to postmodernism.</v>

43
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.430
<v Speaker 1>We talked a little bit about it.</v>
