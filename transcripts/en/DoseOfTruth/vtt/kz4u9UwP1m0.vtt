1
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:08.470
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2
00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:13.470
<v Speaker 1>So how did your work on disgust changed the way that you looked at things?</v>

3
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.950
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally mean you gave some indication of that already,</v>

4
00:00:16.951 --> 00:00:18.600
<v Speaker 1>but what else has changed?</v>

5
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.200
<v Speaker 1>So since I was coming out of a,</v>

6
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.800
<v Speaker 1>of a psychological literature that was very focused on,</v>

7
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.420
<v Speaker 1>on sort of secular,</v>

8
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.140
<v Speaker 1>secular ethics about justice and fairness,</v>

9
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.580
<v Speaker 1>and then I began studying,</v>

10
00:00:32.581 --> 00:00:36.930
<v Speaker 1>discussed and looking at the broader moral domain that almost all societies</v>

11
00:00:36.931 --> 00:00:37.764
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

12
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.230
<v Speaker 1>that then also led me to think about,</v>

13
00:00:40.231 --> 00:00:40.321
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

14
00:00:40.321 --> 00:00:40.531
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

15
00:00:40.531 --> 00:00:44.670
<v Speaker 1>if disgust is a reaction to things that seem to be degrading.</v>

16
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.270
<v Speaker 1>So an interesting element of discusses this notion of degradation that there are</v>

17
00:00:48.271 --> 00:00:49.830
<v Speaker 1>always these vertical metaphors.</v>

18
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:50.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

19
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:51.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.771
<v Speaker 1>image discussed,</v>

21
00:00:51.771 --> 00:00:53.580
<v Speaker 1>brings us down and discussed it.</v>

22
00:00:53.581 --> 00:00:57.990
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of some religious practice in Judaism and Islam and Hinduism is about</v>

23
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.090
<v Speaker 1>preparing your body to approach God and uh,</v>

24
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.040
<v Speaker 1>purification.</v>

25
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.180
<v Speaker 1>And so that led me to think,</v>

26
00:01:03.181 --> 00:01:03.450
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

27
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.450
<v Speaker 1>if there's an emotion which is about seeing our lower base or animal biological</v>

28
00:01:08.461 --> 00:01:09.294
<v Speaker 1>nature,</v>

29
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.800
<v Speaker 1>is there an opposite emotion?</v>

30
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.400
<v Speaker 1>Is there an emotion that we feel when we see some manifestation of a higher</v>

31
00:01:14.401 --> 00:01:15.300
<v Speaker 1>nobler nature?</v>

32
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.220
<v Speaker 1>And I was just beginning to think this,</v>

33
00:01:17.221 --> 00:01:18.390
<v Speaker 1>when I moved to Uva,</v>

34
00:01:18.391 --> 00:01:22.350
<v Speaker 1>I got my first job at University of Virginia in 1995 and I read,</v>

35
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

36
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.660
<v Speaker 1>the set of Thomas Jefferson's letters.</v>

37
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.270
<v Speaker 1>And in one letter he describes,</v>

38
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.140
<v Speaker 1>he describes the feelings you get from reading great fiction.</v>

39
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.040
<v Speaker 1>He advises a cousin of his that he should buy fiction for his library,</v>

40
00:01:35.041 --> 00:01:35.611
<v Speaker 1>not just,</v>

41
00:01:35.611 --> 00:01:35.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

42
00:01:35.821 --> 00:01:37.560
<v Speaker 1>serious works of law and philosophy.</v>

43
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.881
<v Speaker 1>And he described,</v>

44
00:01:38.881 --> 00:01:39.310
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

45
00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.800
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

46
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.310
<v Speaker 1>doesn't,</v>

47
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

48
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.770
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

49
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.200
<v Speaker 1>he describes the feeling of,</v>

50
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.090
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

51
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

52
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.040
<v Speaker 1>of uh,</v>

53
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.840
<v Speaker 1>having your sentiments be elevated.</v>

54
00:01:45.841 --> 00:01:50.610
<v Speaker 1>Does it not dilate your breast or giving an open feeling in your chest when you</v>

55
00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:53.100
<v Speaker 1>see these acts of beauty and kindness and gratitude?</v>

56
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.551
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

57
00:01:53.551 --> 00:01:53.970
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

58
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:54.950
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly yet.</v>

59
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.830
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

60
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.480
<v Speaker 1>and so because I've been studying discussed,</v>

61
00:01:57.481 --> 00:01:59.190
<v Speaker 1>I then started studying its opposite,</v>

62
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.740
<v Speaker 1>which I and some others called moral elevation.</v>

63
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.270
<v Speaker 1>So this is kind of vertical metaphor of elevation and degradation and it snaps</v>

64
00:02:06.271 --> 00:02:08.280
<v Speaker 1>onto the body too with regards to,</v>

65
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:08.941
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

66
00:02:08.941 --> 00:02:09.774
<v Speaker 1>High Low,</v>

67
00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:10.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

68
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.711
<v Speaker 1>clean,</v>

69
00:02:10.711 --> 00:02:11.544
<v Speaker 1>dirty.</v>

70
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

71
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.321
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

72
00:02:12.321 --> 00:02:12.550
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

73
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:13.680
<v Speaker 1>it's a beautiful pairing.</v>

74
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.450
<v Speaker 1>And so having this language of elevation and discussed just really has helped me</v>

75
00:02:18.451 --> 00:02:19.560
<v Speaker 1>see a lot of things.</v>

76
00:02:19.561 --> 00:02:19.920
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

77
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.660
<v Speaker 1>I can just see a lot of things happening.</v>

78
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.771
<v Speaker 1>It allows me to,</v>

79
00:02:22.771 --> 00:02:23.460
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

80
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.791
<v Speaker 1>even in,</v>

81
00:02:23.791 --> 00:02:23.941
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

82
00:02:23.941 --> 00:02:24.391
<v Speaker 1>manipulate,</v>

83
00:02:24.391 --> 00:02:25.770
<v Speaker 1>like of applying for a grant proposal.</v>

84
00:02:25.771 --> 00:02:29.100
<v Speaker 1>Like it I can get very good at like having an elevating ending and you know,</v>

85
00:02:29.101 --> 00:02:29.460
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

86
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.180
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

87
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.391
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

88
00:02:30.391 --> 00:02:32.220
<v Speaker 1>to end with a note of uplift.</v>

89
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:33.323
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

90
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:34.920
<v Speaker 1>and so it just brought it,</v>

91
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.720
<v Speaker 1>it just broadened my thinking about morality.</v>

92
00:02:36.721 --> 00:02:39.090
<v Speaker 1>And this was around 1995 and so again,</v>

93
00:02:39.091 --> 00:02:40.210
<v Speaker 1>it just prepared me so that,</v>

94
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.800
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

95
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

96
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.810
<v Speaker 1>and I'd already been to India by that point.</v>

97
00:02:42.811 --> 00:02:44.360
<v Speaker 1>I spent three months doing research in,</v>

98
00:02:44.361 --> 00:02:45.031
<v Speaker 1>in Orissa,</v>

99
00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:45.900
<v Speaker 1>in eastern India.</v>

100
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.650
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

101
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.480
<v Speaker 1>so it just broadened my thinking and that's what allowed me finally to</v>

102
00:02:51.481 --> 00:02:55.050
<v Speaker 1>understand conservatives because I had always been on the left.</v>

103
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.300
<v Speaker 1>I hated Ronald Reagan.</v>

104
00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.173
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

105
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.620
<v Speaker 1>I thought Republicans were stupid and evil and it was only when I had gone to</v>

106
00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:06.850
<v Speaker 1>India and really tried to understand a traditional religious,</v>

107
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.610
<v Speaker 1>hierarchical gender stratified society.</v>

108
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.440
<v Speaker 1>Tried to understand it in their terms.</v>

109
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:13.000
<v Speaker 1>They didn't try to just bring in my own,</v>

110
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.710
<v Speaker 1>my own western left,</v>

111
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

112
00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:16.150
<v Speaker 1>left leaning perspectives.</v>

113
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.050
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

114
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.190
<v Speaker 1>that I was,</v>

115
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.550
<v Speaker 1>and this was all under the guidance of Richard Suede or my postdoc supervisor at</v>

116
00:03:21.551 --> 00:03:22.420
<v Speaker 1>the University of Chicago.</v>

117
00:03:22.421 --> 00:03:23.254
<v Speaker 1>We did a post doc.</v>

118
00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:24.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

119
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.080
<v Speaker 1>it was only then that he was able to,</v>

120
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.460
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

121
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.920
<v Speaker 1>to sort of get inside their minds and their moral system and see that there were</v>

122
00:03:29.921 --> 00:03:31.840
<v Speaker 1>alternative moral worlds.</v>

123
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.200
<v Speaker 1>They each had their own logic and that was the metaphor I came to it.</v>

124
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:35.321
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

125
00:03:35.321 --> 00:03:36.154
<v Speaker 1>at the time,</v>

126
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.311
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

127
00:03:36.311 --> 00:03:37.990
<v Speaker 1>the matrix movies were very popular.</v>

128
00:03:37.991 --> 00:03:39.130
<v Speaker 1>So the metaphor,</v>

129
00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.300
<v Speaker 1>the Matrix as a consensual hallucination made a lot of sense.</v>

130
00:03:42.301 --> 00:03:45.430
<v Speaker 1>It's waking up with the idea of just speaking about moral matrices have a</v>

131
00:03:45.431 --> 00:03:46.264
<v Speaker 1>different moral matrix,</v>

132
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.170
<v Speaker 1>better grounded in biology and biology in the sense that it gives us the</v>

133
00:03:50.171 --> 00:03:50.801
<v Speaker 1>potential.</v>

134
00:03:50.801 --> 00:03:54.160
<v Speaker 1>It's like the building blocks of this matrix can't be just anything that comes,</v>

135
00:03:54.161 --> 00:03:56.050
<v Speaker 1>it comes from our experiences,</v>

136
00:03:56.051 --> 00:03:57.430
<v Speaker 1>our embodied experiences.</v>

137
00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.941
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

138
00:03:57.941 --> 00:03:58.810
<v Speaker 1>George Lakoff is the,</v>

139
00:03:58.811 --> 00:03:59.790
<v Speaker 1>is the master of,</v>

140
00:03:59.791 --> 00:03:59.970
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

141
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:00.940
<v Speaker 1>of that thinking.</v>

142
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.510
<v Speaker 1>And so it was only then that I was able to now listen to conservative talk radio</v>

143
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.410
<v Speaker 1>and Christian religious radio and see,</v>

144
00:04:11.411 --> 00:04:12.100
<v Speaker 1>rather than just saying,</v>

145
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.300
<v Speaker 1>oh that was stupid terrible.</v>

146
00:04:13.301 --> 00:04:14.020
<v Speaker 1>People say like,</v>

147
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.220
<v Speaker 1>Oh wow,</v>

148
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.910
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

149
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.640
<v Speaker 1>I can see that they're striving for certain versions.</v>

150
00:04:17.641 --> 00:04:18.160
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

151
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.770
<v Speaker 1>So you started to understand their metaphorical language essentially.</v>

152
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:21.161
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

153
00:04:21.161 --> 00:04:22.360
<v Speaker 1>And that was like kind of like my,</v>

154
00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:22.711
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

155
00:04:22.711 --> 00:04:24.940
<v Speaker 1>on a great awakening or scales falling from my eyes.</v>

156
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.841
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

157
00:04:25.841 --> 00:04:27.010
<v Speaker 1>since well it took a few more,</v>

158
00:04:27.011 --> 00:04:28.120
<v Speaker 1>it took a number of a lot more years.</v>

159
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.710
<v Speaker 1>But eventually I kinda just like pulled out the implants from my eyes and I</v>

160
00:04:32.711 --> 00:04:36.640
<v Speaker 1>stopped seeing everything through a partisan lens and I'm not on any side now.</v>

161
00:04:36.641 --> 00:04:37.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to understand what that is.</v>

162
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.411
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

163
00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:39.400
<v Speaker 1>it's really useful.</v>

164
00:04:39.401 --> 00:04:43.990
<v Speaker 1>It's really useful to understand that there are actual reasons why people see</v>

165
00:04:43.991 --> 00:04:47.680
<v Speaker 1>the world differently and that you can't just easily say that one is right and</v>

166
00:04:47.681 --> 00:04:51.010
<v Speaker 1>the other is wrong because the liberals are correct when it comes to borders,</v>

167
00:04:51.011 --> 00:04:54.040
<v Speaker 1>that if you thicken them too much and diminish the information flow,</v>

168
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.570
<v Speaker 1>you risk making the society so static that any radical environmental</v>

169
00:04:58.571 --> 00:04:59.980
<v Speaker 1>transformation will sink it.</v>

170
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.150
<v Speaker 1>It's the case,</v>

171
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.110
<v Speaker 1>but the conservatives are right in that you pay a big price with regards to</v>

172
00:05:05.111 --> 00:05:09.850
<v Speaker 1>newcomers and new information with regards to risk to exposure to contaminating</v>

173
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.260
<v Speaker 1>while to contamination period,</v>

174
00:05:11.261 --> 00:05:12.970
<v Speaker 1>but also to contaminating ideas.</v>

175
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.980
<v Speaker 1>And so then I've always thought,</v>

176
00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:15.221
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

177
00:05:15.221 --> 00:05:15.870
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

178
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.730
<v Speaker 1>the environment itself moves back and forth like a snake in some sense.</v>

179
00:05:19.731 --> 00:05:22.810
<v Speaker 1>And what we're trying to do is stay on the center of its back.</v>

180
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.270
<v Speaker 1>And the only way we can do that is by people,</v>

181
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.160
<v Speaker 1>by having people pull to the right and say,</v>

182
00:05:27.161 --> 00:05:27.881
<v Speaker 1>be careful.</v>

183
00:05:27.881 --> 00:05:29.260
<v Speaker 1>And people pull to the left and say,</v>

184
00:05:29.261 --> 00:05:29.501
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

185
00:05:29.501 --> 00:05:29.741
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

186
00:05:29.741 --> 00:05:33.030
<v Speaker 1>but be open with that dialogue and the,</v>

187
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.100
<v Speaker 1>the exchange of information that that dialogue allows,</v>

188
00:05:36.101 --> 00:05:41.101
<v Speaker 1>we can maybe specify the center of that moving target and stay and stay well and</v>

189
00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:42.610
<v Speaker 1>stay on the back.</v>

190
00:05:42.611 --> 00:05:42.830
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>

191
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:43.390
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

192
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.661
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

193
00:05:43.661 --> 00:05:45.420
<v Speaker 1>So that's a really complicated metaphor with the snake,</v>

194
00:05:45.421 --> 00:05:45.960
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's,</v>

195
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:46.190
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

196
00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:50.240
<v Speaker 1>it's a perfect way in to what's going on on campus and to why viewpoint</v>

197
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.120
<v Speaker 1>diversity is so important.</v>
