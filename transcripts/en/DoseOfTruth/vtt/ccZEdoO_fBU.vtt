00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:04.140
<v Speaker 1>And so the loose start started talking over in general for years goals because</v>

71
00:04:05.051 --> 00:04:05.884
<v Speaker 1>about her,</v>

00:04:14.561 --> 00:04:15.640
<v Speaker 1>I go to three anyway,</v>

77
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.800

80
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.550
<v Speaker 1>we think we'll want to take the risk</v>

81
00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.350
<v Speaker 1>with the alternative is to take out the risk,</v>

82
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.810
<v Speaker 1>which was to not say something.</v>

83
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.621
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

84
00:04:32.621 --> 00:04:32.861
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

85
00:04:32.861 --> 00:04:35.710
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't taking notes down as a worsened his plan,</v>

86
00:04:35.711 --> 00:04:36.544
<v Speaker 1>a huge,</v>

87
00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.923
<v Speaker 1>massive,</v>

88
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:39.990
<v Speaker 1>no separatism,</v>

89
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.330
<v Speaker 1>Tiernan free [inaudible] becoming worse because good people shop [inaudible]</v>

90
00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:59.780
<v Speaker 1>well</v>

91
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.993
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

92
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:08.670
<v Speaker 1>we'll just refer to us just to get worse.</v>

93
00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:13.890
<v Speaker 1>It's a real nabb [inaudible] early in the knock on effect because you've never</v>

94
00:05:14.741 --> 00:05:15.574
<v Speaker 1>been,</v>

95
00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.520
<v Speaker 1>well I didn't want to recall</v>

96
00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:24.643
<v Speaker 1>turnoff.</v>

97
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.220
<v Speaker 1>So that's just one group.</v>

98
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:29.891
<v Speaker 1>We say,</v>

99
00:05:29.891 --> 00:05:31.120
<v Speaker 1>well that's small,</v>

100
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.180
<v Speaker 1>like the outlaw,</v>

101
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:33.620
<v Speaker 1>which most social settings,</v>

102
00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:35.143
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

103
00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:42.293
<v Speaker 1>20 of</v>

104
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:49.103
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

105
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm probably wrong because I'm assuming,</v>

106
00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:23.020
<v Speaker 1>can you tell me</v>

107
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:34.250
<v Speaker 1>if you're in your apartment,</v>

108
00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:37.180
<v Speaker 1>but at least to get you to say,</v>

109
00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.340
<v Speaker 1>maybe we can offer a kit</v>

110
00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:49.410
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

111
00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:56.110
<v Speaker 1>work as well,</v>

112
00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.010
<v Speaker 1>where in the case if you think something,</v>

113
00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:05.910
<v Speaker 1>the probability than most other people also thinking very hot,</v>

114
00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:13.450
<v Speaker 1>a spectacular jeans and just absolutely original [inaudible].</v>

115
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:14.620
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

116
00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:19.300
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to [inaudible] but anonymously,</v>

117
00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:20.810
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

118
00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:21.770
<v Speaker 1>but other than that,</v>

119
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.250
<v Speaker 1>if you're a reasonable person face on,</v>

120
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.570
<v Speaker 1>everyone else is thinking too.</v>

121
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.260
<v Speaker 1>And just we'll say,</v>

122
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.180
<v Speaker 1>if you say,</v>

123
00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.870
<v Speaker 1>well then maybe we'll say,</v>

124
00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.440
<v Speaker 1>and you've been talking about convenience,</v>

125
00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:35.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

126
00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:40.420
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] types of comedian because comedians to that whole entire Taiwanese</v>

127
00:07:40.601 --> 00:07:41.211
<v Speaker 1>was thinking off,</v>

128
00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:42.044
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

129
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.550
<v Speaker 1>here's some of the whole thing.</v>

130
00:07:43.551 --> 00:07:44.630
<v Speaker 1>And they're going to say,</v>

131
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.560
<v Speaker 1>can we say,</v>

132
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:47.043
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

133
00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:53.540
<v Speaker 1>the gesture a short term,</v>

134
00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:54.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

135
00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:57.260
<v Speaker 1>Because he's the [inaudible] committee.</v>

136
00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:58.740
<v Speaker 1>Here's what we're really about.</v>

137
00:07:59.000 --> 00:07:59.590
<v Speaker 1>And everyone,</v>

138
00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:03.330
<v Speaker 1>certainly me through life like that,</v>

139
00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:04.780
<v Speaker 1>we have to be careful.</v>

140
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:05.950
<v Speaker 1>You have to be weighed.</v>

141
00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:06.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

142
00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.700
<v Speaker 1>if you're a reasonable person for thinking usable things that probably everyone</v>

143
00:08:10.701 --> 00:08:15.610
<v Speaker 1>else has the suspicion that indicate soon so then they don't have to do anything</v>

144
00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.300
<v Speaker 1>in forced silence.</v>

145
00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:20.510
<v Speaker 1>So in crushing story we'll do it</v>

146
00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:28.930
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] here</v>

147
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.270
<v Speaker 1>at least in part,</v>

148
00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:14.493
