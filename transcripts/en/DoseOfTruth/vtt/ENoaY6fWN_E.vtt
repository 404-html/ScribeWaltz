1
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.540
<v Speaker 1>Masculine masculinity is tyranny,</v>

2
00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.990
<v Speaker 1>but the right amount is order and too much femininity is chaos,</v>

3
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.920
<v Speaker 1>which is the word for the right amount of femininity.</v>

4
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.630
<v Speaker 1>That's a really good question.</v>

5
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.590
<v Speaker 1>I read that a bit earlier and I couldn't come up with something immediate,</v>

6
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.160
<v Speaker 1>but the only thing I can think of is that often femininity has been</v>

7
00:00:30.131 --> 00:00:35.131
<v Speaker 1>characterized as wisdom and maybe that's so,</v>

8
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:36.870
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>

9
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.970
<v Speaker 1>the wisdom that God in the Judeo Christian tradition that God consults is</v>

10
00:00:42.851 --> 00:00:43.684
<v Speaker 1>feminine.</v>

11
00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.690
<v Speaker 1>That's an old tradition and maybe that's because order needs to be leaving with</v>

12
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.150
<v Speaker 1>the right amount of chaos in order for wisdom to emerge the order,</v>

13
00:00:55.151 --> 00:00:56.280
<v Speaker 1>it can be blinded,</v>

14
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.820
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical and dead.</v>

15
00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:59.380
<v Speaker 1>And so it's,</v>

16
00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.380
<v Speaker 1>it's the mixture of the right amount of chaos that turns that order into wisdom</v>

17
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.870
<v Speaker 1>and then that wisdom is often personified as feminine.</v>

18
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.950
<v Speaker 1>Now that doesn't exactly answer your question because it doesn't make the right</v>

19
00:01:11.951 --> 00:01:12.430
<v Speaker 1>balance.</v>

20
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.620
<v Speaker 1>You still don't have tyranny order,</v>

21
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:17.810
<v Speaker 1>you still don't have order,</v>

22
00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:18.644
<v Speaker 1>tyranny,</v>

23
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.433
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>

24
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.870
<v Speaker 1>You're still missing the proper word there.</v>

25
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.293
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

26
00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.293
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

27
00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.911
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

28
00:01:25.911 --> 00:01:26.890
<v Speaker 1>it's a good question.</v>

29
00:01:26.891 --> 00:01:27.130
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

30
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.490
<v Speaker 1>and the wisdom ideas the best I can make of it for now.</v>

31
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.680
<v Speaker 1>Is it better to marry someone with your temperament or a contrasting</v>

32
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.390
<v Speaker 1>complimentary temperament?</v>

33
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.650
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

34
00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.030
<v Speaker 1>there is evidence on this and basically you don't want to marry someone with</v>

35
00:01:43.031 --> 00:01:44.380
<v Speaker 1>whom you're two mismatched.</v>

36
00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.310
<v Speaker 1>Now the only possible exception to that is neuroticism.</v>

37
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.933
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

38
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.010
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism is a good predictor of marital trouble and it's a good predictor of</v>

39
00:01:54.011 --> 00:01:56.680
<v Speaker 1>trouble period or perhaps sensitivity to trouble,</v>

40
00:01:56.681 --> 00:01:58.900
<v Speaker 1>which is in some sense the same thing.</v>

41
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:00.580
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

42
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.050
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know of any research specifically pertaining to this.</v>

43
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.340
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

44
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.850
<v Speaker 1>now I know that people who are high in neuroticism are more likely to miss work</v>

45
00:02:09.851 --> 00:02:12.460
<v Speaker 1>and to visit the doctor and to,</v>

46
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

47
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.930
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

48
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.240
<v Speaker 1>and to be unhappy in their marriages and so forth.</v>

49
00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.540
<v Speaker 1>And that may also account for why 75% of divorces are initiated by women.</v>

50
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.750
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

51
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.300
<v Speaker 1>and I think women are more sensitive to negative emotion,</v>

52
00:02:25.301 --> 00:02:28.450
<v Speaker 1>partly because they have to take care of infants and need to be more sensitive</v>

53
00:02:28.451 --> 00:02:28.871
<v Speaker 1>to threat.</v>

54
00:02:28.871 --> 00:02:33.871
<v Speaker 1>And perhaps because sexuality is more dangerous to women and perhaps because</v>

55
00:02:34.811 --> 00:02:36.280
<v Speaker 1>women are physically smaller.</v>

56
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.790
<v Speaker 1>And all of this seems to kick in at puberty anyways.</v>

57
00:02:39.791 --> 00:02:43.810
<v Speaker 1>It isn't obvious to me that you want to match someone with regards to</v>

58
00:02:43.811 --> 00:02:44.501
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism.</v>

59
00:02:44.501 --> 00:02:46.000
<v Speaker 1>If you're high in neuroticism,</v>

60
00:02:46.001 --> 00:02:47.530
<v Speaker 1>I think if you're high in neuroticism,</v>

61
00:02:47.531 --> 00:02:49.840
<v Speaker 1>you need to find someone who is low in neuroticism,</v>

62
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.920
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

63
00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.560
<v Speaker 1>because then you have someone around to calm you down.</v>

64
00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.450
<v Speaker 1>Now apart from that,</v>

65
00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.850
<v Speaker 1>the research literature does indicate that match is better and you can see why</v>

66
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.140
<v Speaker 1>it's hard for extroverts and introverts to get along if they're,</v>

67
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.260
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're extreme extroverts and extreme introverts because an</v>

68
00:03:08.261 --> 00:03:13.210
<v Speaker 1>extreme extrovert always wants to be with other people and in groups and an</v>

69
00:03:13.211 --> 00:03:16.030
<v Speaker 1>extreme introvert hardly ever wants that.</v>

70
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.960
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very,</v>

71
00:03:16.961 --> 00:03:18.790
<v Speaker 1>very difficult thing to negotiate.</v>

72
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.430
<v Speaker 1>And then with conscientiousness,</v>

73
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:22.211
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>

74
00:03:22.211 --> 00:03:23.680
<v Speaker 1>If you're really high in orderliness,</v>

75
00:03:23.681 --> 00:03:26.570
<v Speaker 1>it's very hard to be married to someone who is very low and ordered.</v>

76
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.600
<v Speaker 1>You're going to end up doing all the cleaning,</v>

77
00:03:28.601 --> 00:03:29.141
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

78
00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:30.220
<v Speaker 1>that will drive you crazy.</v>

79
00:03:30.221 --> 00:03:31.600
<v Speaker 1>And if you're high and industriousness,</v>

80
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:32.583
<v Speaker 1>same thing,</v>

81
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.570
<v Speaker 1>healthy,</v>

82
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.370
<v Speaker 1>are super high and industriousness and orderliness,</v>

83
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.630
<v Speaker 1>you might want someone who's maybe moderate in both to kind of temper you a bit</v>

84
00:03:40.631 --> 00:03:43.900
<v Speaker 1>because one of the problems with being too high in conscientiousness is that you</v>

85
00:03:43.901 --> 00:03:47.710
<v Speaker 1>can't stop working and you should probably stop working from time to time.</v>

86
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.120
<v Speaker 1>Agreeableness,</v>

87
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.110
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>

88
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.930
<v Speaker 1>Hard for an agreeable and disagreeable person to get along.</v>

89
00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.621
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

90
00:03:53.621 --> 00:03:55.330
<v Speaker 1>the agreeable person will always be</v>

91
00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.410
<v Speaker 1>the disagreeable person.</v>

92
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

93
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.990
<v Speaker 1>Who won't shy away from conflict is likely to dominate the agreeable person</v>

94
00:04:04.991 --> 00:04:05.824
<v Speaker 1>quite badly.</v>

95
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.970
<v Speaker 1>So that's a tough bridge to two.</v>

96
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.380
<v Speaker 1>That's a tough chasm to bridge as well.</v>

97
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.130
<v Speaker 1>So you look for temperamental similarity.</v>

98
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm at now it's complicated because like if you're really,</v>

99
00:04:19.871 --> 00:04:22.870
<v Speaker 1>really low and industriousness and you marry someone else who's really low and</v>

100
00:04:22.871 --> 00:04:23.621
<v Speaker 1>industriousness,</v>

101
00:04:23.621 --> 00:04:26.620
<v Speaker 1>well that's going to be trouble for both of you because there isn't going to be</v>

102
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.510
<v Speaker 1>anyone around who's going to do the work.</v>

103
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:29.733
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

104
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:30.490
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

105
00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.050
<v Speaker 1>you might understand each other better,</v>

106
00:04:32.051 --> 00:04:34.810
<v Speaker 1>but as a long term strategy it's not a very good one.</v>

107
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:36.003
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

108
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.600
<v Speaker 1>it seems like your message is primarily positive masculine,</v>

109
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.970
<v Speaker 1>whereas the positive feminine is not elaborated with near the same resolution.</v>

110
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.200
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>

111
00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:48.483
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

112
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't really think that's true.</v>

113
00:04:50.561 --> 00:04:50.980
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

114
00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.920
<v Speaker 1>I think that might be somewhat true of 12 rules for life,</v>

115
00:04:53.921 --> 00:04:55.260
<v Speaker 1>although I'm not convinced of that.</v>

116
00:04:55.261 --> 00:04:59.500
<v Speaker 1>That message and 12 rules for life is to find a balance between order and chaos.</v>

117
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:05.100
<v Speaker 1>And there's plenty of discussion in there about the danger of an excess of both.</v>

118
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.480
<v Speaker 1>Certainly maps of meaning is,</v>

119
00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:08.763
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

120
00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.670
<v Speaker 1>elaborated out more with regards to the positive masculine.</v>

121
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.270
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

122
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:19.270
<v Speaker 1>With regards to maps of meaning is elaborated out more completely than 12 rules</v>

123
00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.140
<v Speaker 1>with regards to the positive role of the masculine and the feminine.</v>

124
00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:25.413
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

125
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:31.510
<v Speaker 1>I think it's complicated in part because the feminine classically speaking is</v>

126
00:05:32.301 --> 00:05:35.570
<v Speaker 1>associated with smaller scale,</v>

127
00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.720
<v Speaker 1>intimate familial groupings.</v>

128
00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.093
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

129
00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.290
<v Speaker 1>in a world that's obsessed with adaptation to large scale social systems,</v>

130
00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.970
<v Speaker 1>it's harder to make a case for the role of the feminine.</v>

131
00:05:55.971 --> 00:05:59.060
<v Speaker 1>We don't really understand role of the feminine in large scale social</v>

132
00:05:59.061 --> 00:05:59.894
<v Speaker 1>structures.</v>

133
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.273
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

134
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.851
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

135
00:06:01.851 --> 00:06:06.740
<v Speaker 1>we don't have a cultural myth apart from beauty and the beast.</v>

136
00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:11.741
<v Speaker 1>Let's say the describes the role of an independent female operating in the</v>

137
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.700
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally masculine social world.</v>

138
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.330
<v Speaker 1>And we don't even know what something like that would look like.</v>

139
00:06:20.331 --> 00:06:25.331
<v Speaker 1>And there aren't guiding stories to some degree because women haven't been able</v>

140
00:06:26.301 --> 00:06:29.420
<v Speaker 1>to do that except in the last hundred years.</v>

141
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.670
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know what,</v>

142
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.950
<v Speaker 1>what the positive feminine on a large scale would look like.</v>

143
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.130
<v Speaker 1>And we don't have guiding stories for that.</v>

144
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:45.340
<v Speaker 1>This is partly to underlined the absolutely radical nature of the birth control</v>

145
00:06:47.361 --> 00:06:47.830
<v Speaker 1>pill.</v>

146
00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:48.030
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

147
00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:48.831
<v Speaker 1>and not only that,</v>

148
00:06:48.831 --> 00:06:50.480
<v Speaker 1>but the provision of,</v>

149
00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:51.463
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

150
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:56.470
<v Speaker 1>of technological devices that aid women in dealing practically with their weekly</v>

151
00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:00.170
<v Speaker 1>or their monthly menstrual cycle,</v>

152
00:07:00.171 --> 00:07:05.171
<v Speaker 1>which was also a huge impediment to women in terms of interacting in the,</v>

153
00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:06.231
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

154
00:07:06.231 --> 00:07:07.430
<v Speaker 1>the patriarchal world.</v>

155
00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:11.990
<v Speaker 1>So now women can take their place in the broader cultural world and we don't</v>

156
00:07:11.991 --> 00:07:13.580
<v Speaker 1>know what the model for that is.</v>

157
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:15.110
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

158
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.471
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

159
00:07:15.471 --> 00:07:16.041
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

160
00:07:16.041 --> 00:07:16.251
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

161
00:07:16.251 --> 00:07:19.820
<v Speaker 1>they should adopt the heroin masculine perspective.</v>

162
00:07:19.821 --> 00:07:21.410
<v Speaker 1>And certainly to some degree that's true,</v>

163
00:07:21.411 --> 00:07:26.411
<v Speaker 1>but that's not a particularly fruitful archetype when it comes to having a</v>

164
00:07:30.621 --> 00:07:34.610
<v Speaker 1>family and having a family is actually extraordinarily important.</v>

165
00:07:34.611 --> 00:07:38.660
<v Speaker 1>And it's certainly the thing that dominates the thoughts of the majority of</v>

166
00:07:38.661 --> 00:07:43.640
<v Speaker 1>women as they approached their thirties all cultural noise to the contrary.</v>

167
00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.850
<v Speaker 1>So it's something we're still puzzling out.</v>

168
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:48.950
<v Speaker 1>And I suppose I'm still puzzling it out too.</v>

169
00:07:48.951 --> 00:07:49.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

170
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:50.450
<v Speaker 1>with my daughter,</v>

171
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:56.110
<v Speaker 1>I tried to encourage her to be as sharp and is intelligent and critically minded</v>

172
00:07:57.381 --> 00:07:59.390
<v Speaker 1>and ambitious as she could be,</v>

173
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:03.370
<v Speaker 1>but also let her to let her know that if she,</v>

174
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.100
<v Speaker 1>and she,</v>

175
00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:04.550
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

176
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:06.710
<v Speaker 1>she was always interested in having kids.</v>

177
00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:07.700
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

178
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:11.120
<v Speaker 1>but to also let her know that having a family who is an extremely important</v>

179
00:08:11.121 --> 00:08:11.954
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

180
00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:13.003
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

181
00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:14.150
<v Speaker 1>how to balance that.</v>

182
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:16.010
<v Speaker 1>Well that is the modern conundrum isn't it?</v>

183
00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:21.280
<v Speaker 1>We want to figure out how to maximize our access to the talents of women,</v>

184
00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:26.890
<v Speaker 1>but also to set up a situation where it's possible for talented women and women</v>

185
00:08:27.411 --> 00:08:28.340
<v Speaker 1>of all talents,</v>

186
00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:29.330
<v Speaker 1>let's say as well,</v>

187
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:33.830
<v Speaker 1>but talented women who have options in the workplace to also have a family.</v>

188
00:08:33.831 --> 00:08:38.000
<v Speaker 1>And this is a tremendously complex problem and it isn't clear how it's going to</v>

189
00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:39.913
<v Speaker 1>be solved.</v>

190
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.791
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

191
00:08:40.791 --> 00:08:41.990
<v Speaker 1>there is data showing,</v>

192
00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:42.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

193
00:08:42.231 --> 00:08:42.501
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

194
00:08:42.501 --> 00:08:42.651
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

195
00:08:42.651 --> 00:08:44.720
<v Speaker 1>men should pick up more of the feminine role.</v>

196
00:08:44.721 --> 00:08:46.580
<v Speaker 1>And I suppose that's possible.</v>

197
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:48.650
<v Speaker 1>But there is good data showing,</v>

198
00:08:48.651 --> 00:08:49.281
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

199
00:08:49.281 --> 00:08:54.281
<v Speaker 1>that if he show women pictures of men engaged in classically masculine</v>

200
00:08:54.441 --> 00:08:55.080
<v Speaker 1>endeavors,</v>

201
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:55.351
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

202
00:08:55.351 --> 00:08:57.840
<v Speaker 1>fixing a roof or fixing the plumbing or so forth,</v>

203
00:08:58.220 --> 00:08:59.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

204
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.650
<v Speaker 1>or in feminine endeavors doing the dishes and,</v>

205
00:09:01.651 --> 00:09:01.951
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

206
00:09:01.951 --> 00:09:02.401
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

207
00:09:02.401 --> 00:09:06.740
<v Speaker 1>and vacuuming that the women rate the man who are doing the female tasks as well</v>

208
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.430
<v Speaker 1>as less sexually attractive.</v>

209
00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:13.940
<v Speaker 1>And so it's not all on the men with regards to the utility of them picking up a</v>

210
00:09:14.071 --> 00:09:15.210
<v Speaker 1>more feminine role,</v>

211
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:15.991
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

212
00:09:15.991 --> 00:09:20.991
<v Speaker 1>and it isn't necessarily the case that women will find men who are more</v>

213
00:09:21.721 --> 00:09:22.590
<v Speaker 1>domestic,</v>

214
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.930
<v Speaker 1>also maximally sexually attractive.</v>

215
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.760
<v Speaker 1>Those things don't necessarily go together.</v>

216
00:09:26.761 --> 00:09:27.541
<v Speaker 1>So this is very,</v>

217
00:09:27.541 --> 00:09:28.590
<v Speaker 1>very complicated.</v>
