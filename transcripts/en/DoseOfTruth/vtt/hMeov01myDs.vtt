1
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.520
<v Speaker 1>What do we do with our ego is helped us climb the dominance hierarchy is secure</v>

2
00:00:11.521 --> 00:00:12.354
<v Speaker 1>a mate.</v>

3
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.840
<v Speaker 1>Why then should we keep looking for a mate and how to curtail that instinct?</v>

4
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:17.281
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5
00:00:17.281 --> 00:00:20.970
<v Speaker 1>I think part of the way that you curtail that inks in state is that you have,</v>

6
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.940
<v Speaker 1>you have this sort of life that you would have with a mate.</v>

7
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.690
<v Speaker 1>The question is what's the purpose of pair bonding?</v>

8
00:00:27.691 --> 00:00:31.410
<v Speaker 1>And one of the fundamental purposes of pair bonding while there's a couple one,</v>

9
00:00:31.411 --> 00:00:36.060
<v Speaker 1>is that it solves the sexual access problem so that you don't have to continue</v>

10
00:00:36.061 --> 00:00:39.700
<v Speaker 1>to obsess about who you're going to be within and,</v>

11
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:40.230
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

12
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:40.800
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

13
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.360
<v Speaker 1>and where and how.</v>

14
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.910
<v Speaker 1>And so you can get on with other elements of your life.</v>

15
00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:46.150
<v Speaker 1>But I mean with,</v>

16
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.890
<v Speaker 1>with your mate,</v>

17
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:47.730
<v Speaker 1>you have to decide,</v>

18
00:00:47.731 --> 00:00:47.940
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

19
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.650
<v Speaker 1>what does it mean that you're now together?</v>

20
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.671
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

21
00:00:50.671 --> 00:00:50.971
<v Speaker 1>you're there,</v>

22
00:00:50.971 --> 00:00:52.500
<v Speaker 1>there's companionship obviously,</v>

23
00:00:52.501 --> 00:00:54.930
<v Speaker 1>and friendship and their shared interests.</v>

24
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.280
<v Speaker 1>You have to decide what they are.</v>

25
00:00:56.281 --> 00:01:01.050
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that you should continue dating your partner at least once a</v>

26
00:01:01.051 --> 00:01:04.350
<v Speaker 1>week or perhaps twice a week because otherwise the romance goes out of your</v>

27
00:01:04.351 --> 00:01:05.070
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

28
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.270
<v Speaker 1>But then also you have to decide about children and eventually about</v>

29
00:01:09.271 --> 00:01:12.990
<v Speaker 1>grandchildren because you know you're going to get old and you're going to get</v>

30
00:01:12.991 --> 00:01:17.370
<v Speaker 1>older and more mature and children are a huge part of life and they get a bad</v>

31
00:01:17.371 --> 00:01:17.760
<v Speaker 1>rap,</v>

32
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.190
<v Speaker 1>which is really unfortunate because you know,</v>

33
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:21.203
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm,</v>

34
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm different in this regard.</v>

35
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.210
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps I am to some degree,</v>

36
00:01:24.211 --> 00:01:29.130
<v Speaker 1>but I never regretted having kids for even one second because there are so mean.</v>

37
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.750
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden you have an intimate relationship with new people that is as</v>

38
00:01:33.751 --> 00:01:36.030
<v Speaker 1>close as any relationship that you've ever had.</v>

39
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.350
<v Speaker 1>You have the opportunity to make that relationship as pristine as you possibly</v>

40
00:01:40.351 --> 00:01:41.040
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>

41
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.231
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

42
00:01:41.231 --> 00:01:43.350
<v Speaker 1>there can be a lot of catastrophe involved in it,</v>

43
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.190
<v Speaker 1>but it's a great opportunity and there's just nothing wrong with having some</v>

44
00:01:47.191 --> 00:01:48.690
<v Speaker 1>additional people that love you,</v>

45
00:01:48.691 --> 00:01:49.500
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

46
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.500
<v Speaker 1>And so what you do is you turn your attention to the issues of maturity and</v>

47
00:01:55.231 --> 00:01:58.800
<v Speaker 1>you're tuning your attention away from the issues of being a juvenile.</v>

48
00:01:58.801 --> 00:02:02.760
<v Speaker 1>And you do that partly by knowing that it's actually better to do.</v>

49
00:02:02.761 --> 00:02:03.450
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

50
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.661
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

51
00:02:03.661 --> 00:02:06.750
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing more absurd than the 40 year old 20 year old.</v>

52
00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.990
<v Speaker 1>It gets ugly and there's something like,</v>

53
00:02:09.991 --> 00:02:11.880
<v Speaker 1>there's something like spoiled milk about it.</v>

54
00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:16.881
<v Speaker 1>It goes off and you have to gracefully accept the challenges of each stage of</v>

55
00:02:18.091 --> 00:02:21.510
<v Speaker 1>life and things work a lot better when you do that much,</v>

56
00:02:21.511 --> 00:02:22.021
<v Speaker 1>much better.</v>

57
00:02:22.021 --> 00:02:23.100
<v Speaker 1>And you also have to,</v>

58
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.293
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

59
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.040
<v Speaker 1>work on and perfect your sex life with your partner and express what you need</v>

60
00:02:29.041 --> 00:02:33.120
<v Speaker 1>and want and teach each other what's necessary to keep things exciting and,</v>

61
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.050
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

62
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.883
<v Speaker 1>and new.</v>

63
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.960
<v Speaker 1>It's not an easy thing to do,</v>

64
00:02:36.961 --> 00:02:40.980
<v Speaker 1>but it's very much worthwhile because then you can combine sexual excitement</v>

65
00:02:40.981 --> 00:02:44.580
<v Speaker 1>with intimacy and there's no better combination than that.</v>

66
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.970
<v Speaker 1>So I'd love that can all be a nested up inside love and inside,</v>

67
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:49.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

68
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.741
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

69
00:02:49.741 --> 00:02:53.490
<v Speaker 1>a destiny that's intertwined together and that's the best you've got man.</v>

70
00:02:53.491 --> 00:02:54.180
<v Speaker 1>That that's,</v>

71
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.720
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

72
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.280
<v Speaker 1>that's what life has to offer.</v>

73
00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:57.743
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

74
00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.863
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

75
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.150
<v Speaker 1>that's what you do is you accept the responsibility of the next stage of life</v>

76
00:03:03.151 --> 00:03:04.950
<v Speaker 1>and you don't mourn the past.</v>

77
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.530
<v Speaker 1>I suppose that also means that when you're young,</v>

78
00:03:07.531 --> 00:03:10.410
<v Speaker 1>you do what young people do and so that you don't want to do it again.</v>
