1
00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.640
<v Speaker 1>A bunch of pensioners</v>

2
00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.190
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>

3
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.460
<v Speaker 1>it's nice to be here and thank you all for coming.</v>

4
00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:04.710
<v Speaker 1>I guess there's lots of people out there.</v>

5
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:06.500
<v Speaker 1>there is.</v>

7
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.020
<v Speaker 1>It's very nice to be here.</v>

8
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.750
<v Speaker 1>Be the down south here in Texas and Arizona.</v>

9
00:01:13.751 --> 00:01:14.090
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

10
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.000
<v Speaker 1>It's been really good.</v>

11
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.510
<v Speaker 1>Very welcoming,</v>

12
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.733
<v Speaker 1>very friendly.</v>

13
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.951
<v Speaker 1>Nice hot.</v>

14
00:01:18.951 --> 00:01:19.784
<v Speaker 1>The</v>

15
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.910
<v Speaker 1>water is liquid.</v>

16
00:01:24.911 --> 00:01:25.930
<v Speaker 1>We're not comfortable.</v>

17
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.730
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

18
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.980
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to talk to you.</v>

19
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.130
<v Speaker 1>I think you broke the rules tonight.</v>

20
00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.450
<v Speaker 1>Maybe get to more.</v>

21
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.100
<v Speaker 1>I want to concentrate on to.</v>

22
00:01:38.101 --> 00:01:43.101
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to concentrate first of all on rule 10 rules for cise</v>

23
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.020
<v Speaker 1>and I want to use that rule to develop,</v>

24
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:55.733
<v Speaker 1>I guess</v>

25
00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.420
<v Speaker 1>as the centerpiece of a meditation on the world because we don't perceive the</v>

26
00:02:04.861 --> 00:02:06.780
<v Speaker 1>world the way we think the proceeds the world.</v>

27
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.830
<v Speaker 1>It's a studied perception for a long time from a biological perspective and if</v>

28
00:02:14.131 --> 00:02:18.900
<v Speaker 1>you studied phenomenon from a biological perspective and you have any sense,</v>

29
00:02:18.901 --> 00:02:22.140
<v Speaker 1>you also studied them from a philosophical perspective.</v>

30
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.690
<v Speaker 1>Philosophical perspective is what enables you to develop the ideas that you've</v>

31
00:02:27.691 --> 00:02:29.190
<v Speaker 1>tested if you're a scientist.</v>

32
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:30.623
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

33
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.530
<v Speaker 1>and I've learned all sorts of things about the way that we perceive the world</v>

34
00:02:34.531 --> 00:02:35.700
<v Speaker 1>that I think are really useful.</v>

35
00:02:35.701 --> 00:02:36.534
<v Speaker 1>They're reading,</v>

36
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.340
<v Speaker 1>they're really useful to know.</v>

37
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.370
<v Speaker 1>So I'm telling you a bunch of those things tonight because I think it'll help</v>

38
00:02:41.371 --> 00:02:44.240
<v Speaker 1>you understand well how you,</v>

39
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.580
<v Speaker 1>what your life and why you're like that.</v>

40
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.130
<v Speaker 1>It's a terrible thing to understand,</v>

41
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.993
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

42
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.670
<v Speaker 1>but I want to aim at something else too.</v>

43
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.760
<v Speaker 1>I want to craft the discussion so that we can deeply investigate the answer to</v>

44
00:03:02.031 --> 00:03:02.864
<v Speaker 1>the question,</v>

45
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:04.810
<v Speaker 1>what should you aim at?</v>

46
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.300
<v Speaker 1>Because you have to aim at something.</v>

47
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.310
<v Speaker 1>We're aiming creatures knots.</v>

48
00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.770
<v Speaker 1>That's like rule number one of perception.</v>

49
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.300
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to tell you the story first about a very famous psychology</v>

50
00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:17.134
<v Speaker 1>experiment,</v>

51
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.020
<v Speaker 1>which you can see online.</v>

52
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.180
<v Speaker 1>It was an experiment done</v>

53
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.810
<v Speaker 1>by Harvard psychologist who was interested in perception.</v>

54
00:03:28.811 --> 00:03:32.290
<v Speaker 1>He's interested in something called changed blindness.</v>

55
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.620
<v Speaker 1>And here's how they experiment with.</v>

56
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure many of you have seen it.</v>

57
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.850
<v Speaker 1>He videotape a group of six people,</v>

58
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.190
<v Speaker 1>three dressed in black and three dressed in white,</v>

59
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.250
<v Speaker 1>videotape them in front of an elevator,</v>

60
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.840
<v Speaker 1>which wasn't really relevant,</v>

61
00:03:49.841 --> 00:03:54.310
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just setting the stage for you and the team dressed in black had a</v>

62
00:03:54.311 --> 00:03:59.020
<v Speaker 1>basketball and the team dressed in white out of basketball,</v>

63
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.550
<v Speaker 1>and they were playing a game.</v>

64
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.300
<v Speaker 1>The game was throw past the basketball,</v>

65
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.950
<v Speaker 1>not a very sophisticated game and the black team would pass the basketball to</v>

66
00:04:08.951 --> 00:04:13.780
<v Speaker 1>the to the teammates dressed in black and the white team with trip pass the</v>

67
00:04:13.781 --> 00:04:15.370
<v Speaker 1>basketball to their teammates,</v>

68
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:16.601
<v Speaker 1>trusted white,</v>

69
00:04:16.601 --> 00:04:21.601
<v Speaker 1>and they would mill around in front of the elevator and they filled the whole</v>

70
00:04:21.821 --> 00:04:22.240
<v Speaker 1>frame.</v>

71
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.590
<v Speaker 1>They weren't distant.</v>

72
00:04:23.591 --> 00:04:24.311
<v Speaker 1>They weren't tiny.</v>

73
00:04:24.311 --> 00:04:27.210
<v Speaker 1>Little people know a half a football field away,</v>

74
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.430
<v Speaker 1>but they filled the whole frame so you could see their facial features and</v>

75
00:04:30.431 --> 00:04:33.250
<v Speaker 1>everything and so your job,</v>

76
00:04:33.251 --> 00:04:35.470
<v Speaker 1>you'd come into Dan Simons lab because the.</v>

77
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:36.910
<v Speaker 1>His name was Dan Simon.</v>

78
00:04:36.911 --> 00:04:41.911
<v Speaker 1>You come into Dan Simons lab and he'd sit you down and you'd sit down and you</v>

79
00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:47.390
<v Speaker 1>listen to him because that's what we do in a psychology lab.</v>

80
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:48.790
<v Speaker 1>That's where thinking about too.</v>

81
00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like,</v>

82
00:04:50.651 --> 00:04:51.760
<v Speaker 1>when you come into the theater,</v>

83
00:04:51.761 --> 00:04:53.060
<v Speaker 1>you point forward and the arts,</v>

84
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.690
<v Speaker 1>the stage you do with the room tells you can do with the experimenter,</v>

85
00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:57.543
<v Speaker 1>tells you.</v>

86
00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.460
<v Speaker 1>That's part of establishing your aim.</v>

87
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.410
<v Speaker 1>He said to the his experimental,</v>

88
00:05:03.411 --> 00:05:06.820
<v Speaker 1>participate participants watch the white team.</v>

89
00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.010
<v Speaker 1>They're going to throw a basketball back and forth.</v>

90
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:10.930
<v Speaker 1>It's going to take about three minutes.</v>

91
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.461
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

92
00:05:11.461 --> 00:05:16.461
<v Speaker 1>Africans count the number of times they throw the basketball and so you think I</v>

93
00:05:17.531 --> 00:05:18.700
<v Speaker 1>can do that,</v>

94
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
<v Speaker 1>and you watch and you're watching the basketball.</v>

95
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.110
<v Speaker 1>You're counting very carefully.</v>

96
00:05:26.111 --> 00:05:29.710
<v Speaker 1>You're concentrating on the task of him because you've been instructed to do</v>

97
00:05:29.711 --> 00:05:34.711
<v Speaker 1>that and the video videotape runs until the end and dance as how many times did</v>

98
00:05:39.611 --> 00:05:41.890
<v Speaker 1>the white team past the basketball and you'd say,</v>

99
00:05:41.891 --> 00:05:43.150
<v Speaker 1>16.</v>

100
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.140
<v Speaker 1>Dan says your excellent right?</v>

101
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.140
<v Speaker 1>When you think you're pretty damn smart.</v>

102
00:05:47.141 --> 00:05:50.990
<v Speaker 1>You went into a psychology lab that you participate in the experiment,</v>

103
00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.480
<v Speaker 1>counter the basketballs properly.</v>

104
00:05:52.481 --> 00:05:54.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're a credible human being.</v>

105
00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.850
<v Speaker 1>No pointed,</v>

106
00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.560
<v Speaker 2>and then Dan says,</v>

107
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.281
<v Speaker 2>what did you see?</v>

108
00:06:01.281 --> 00:06:04.100
<v Speaker 2>Anything out of the ordinary?</v>

109
00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:05.593
<v Speaker 2>And you say,</v>

110
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.081
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

111
00:06:06.081 --> 00:06:06.471
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

112
00:06:06.471 --> 00:06:07.011
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>

113
00:06:07.011 --> 00:06:07.280
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

114
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.240
<v Speaker 2>what did you see the gorilla and you think,</v>

115
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:12.321
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean?</v>

116
00:06:12.321 --> 00:06:12.890
<v Speaker 2>Did I?</v>

117
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.570
<v Speaker 2>Of course what gorilla?</v>

118
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.690
<v Speaker 2>Like if there was a gorilla gorilla,</v>

119
00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.120
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see any damn gorilla,</v>

120
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.430
<v Speaker 2>and so Dan rewinds the tape and he says,</v>

121
00:06:22.431 --> 00:06:22.641
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

122
00:06:22.641 --> 00:06:24.410
<v Speaker 2>don't count the damn basketball system.</v>

123
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.130
<v Speaker 2>He didn't say that.</v>

124
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:25.401
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

125
00:06:25.401 --> 00:06:25.940
<v Speaker 2>don't do that.</v>

126
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:26.773
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

127
00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:30.730
<v Speaker 2>Don't count the basketball this time.</v>

128
00:06:30.731 --> 00:06:32.070
<v Speaker 2>Just watched the film.</v>

129
00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:37.500
<v Speaker 2>So you watch it and sure enough like minute into the film,</v>

130
00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:38.640
<v Speaker 2>this guy comes out.</v>

131
00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:41.070
<v Speaker 2>It's not a real gorilla that's close enough.</v>

132
00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.690
<v Speaker 2>He's like six foot four.</v>

133
00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:44.560
<v Speaker 2>He's got a gorilla suit on.</v>

134
00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:49.610
<v Speaker 2>It's the full thing and he stands right in the middle of the video and pounds</v>

135
00:06:50.221 --> 00:06:55.221
<v Speaker 2>his chest for like five seconds and then Saundra's off about 50 percent of the</v>

136
00:06:56.791 --> 00:06:57.960
<v Speaker 2>people who saw the video.</v>

137
00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.870
<v Speaker 2>Sixty percent of the people didn't see the gorilla.</v>

138
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:02.653
<v Speaker 2>You think,</v>

139
00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:03.181
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

140
00:07:03.181 --> 00:07:04.110
<v Speaker 2>I'd see the gorilla.</v>

141
00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:04.441
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

142
00:07:04.441 --> 00:07:04.651
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

143
00:07:04.651 --> 00:07:05.190
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't.</v>

144
00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:06.150
<v Speaker 2>Not necessarily.</v>

145
00:07:06.151 --> 00:07:07.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm a graduate student.</v>

146
00:07:07.171 --> 00:07:11.680
<v Speaker 2>I showed that video to and then I showed it to him a year later he missed the</v>

147
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.170
<v Speaker 2>damn grill and the second time</v>

148
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.640
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

149
00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.300
<v Speaker 2>And so and so,</v>

150
00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:20.290
<v Speaker 2>and you think,</v>

151
00:07:20.291 --> 00:07:20.680
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

152
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.820
<v Speaker 2>there's no way on that one.</v>

153
00:07:21.821 --> 00:07:22.121
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

154
00:07:22.121 --> 00:07:22.954
<v Speaker 2>yes you are.</v>

155
00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:23.920
<v Speaker 2>You're so blind.</v>

156
00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.600
<v Speaker 2>You cannot in bloody will imagine.</v>

157
00:07:25.601 --> 00:07:30.601
<v Speaker 2>It is absolute miracle that you just don't wash my face first in the walls all</v>

158
00:07:30.851 --> 00:07:31.684
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>

159
00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:32.950
<v Speaker 2>Actually you do.</v>

160
00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.220
<v Speaker 2>Life hurts because you do,</v>

161
00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:40.090
<v Speaker 2>you don't see very well and you do walk face first into things all the time.</v>

162
00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.280
<v Speaker 2>Maybe not literal walls,</v>

163
00:07:42.281 --> 00:07:45.940
<v Speaker 2>but certainly metaphorical ones and that's often because you don't see what's in</v>

164
00:07:45.941 --> 00:07:49.180
<v Speaker 2>front of you and it's because you're looking at the wrong thing.</v>

165
00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:51.220
<v Speaker 2>And so what was so cool about that?</v>

166
00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:56.221
<v Speaker 2>Experiments that insanely cool psychologists up to that point thought that while</v>

167
00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.170
<v Speaker 2>we thought a lot of things and a lot,</v>

168
00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:00.730
<v Speaker 2>not just psychologists on two,</v>

169
00:08:00.731 --> 00:08:01.390
<v Speaker 2>we saw,</v>

170
00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:05.260
<v Speaker 2>we thought it was easy to see the world that was kind of disproved back in the</v>

171
00:08:05.261 --> 00:08:10.240
<v Speaker 2>early sixties when people were trying to build machines that can operate in the</v>

172
00:08:10.241 --> 00:08:12.930
<v Speaker 2>world like people knew trying to solve the problem.</v>

173
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.200
<v Speaker 2>Machine perception.</v>

174
00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:14.700
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

175
00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:15.391
<v Speaker 2>we just thought,</v>

176
00:08:15.391 --> 00:08:15.821
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>

177
00:08:15.821 --> 00:08:17.380
<v Speaker 2>there's objects right there.</v>

178
00:08:17.381 --> 00:08:18.460
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty self evident.</v>

179
00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:19.630
<v Speaker 2>You just see it.</v>

180
00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:19.721
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

181
00:08:19.721 --> 00:08:20.680
<v Speaker 2>you know how it easy it is.</v>

182
00:08:20.681 --> 00:08:23.290
<v Speaker 2>All you have to do to see that object is look at it.</v>

183
00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:24.340
<v Speaker 2>There it is.</v>

184
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:26.290
<v Speaker 2>It's not a problem.</v>

185
00:08:26.291 --> 00:08:27.070
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

186
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:28.240
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing magical about it.</v>

187
00:08:28.241 --> 00:08:28.571
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

188
00:08:28.571 --> 00:08:28.721
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

189
00:08:28.721 --> 00:08:30.160
<v Speaker 2>you turned to build a machine that did.</v>

190
00:08:30.161 --> 00:08:35.161
<v Speaker 2>Does that you find out that perceiving separate law objects is so difficult that</v>

191
00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:37.180
<v Speaker 2>it actually looks impossible.</v>

192
00:08:37.181 --> 00:08:39.040
<v Speaker 2>It isn't obvious at all how we do it,</v>

193
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:43.090
<v Speaker 2>not in the least and that's why it's so difficult to to build machines.</v>

194
00:08:43.091 --> 00:08:45.130
<v Speaker 2>That's why we don't have ambulatory robots.</v>

195
00:08:45.131 --> 00:08:46.000
<v Speaker 2>Busing tables,</v>

196
00:08:46.001 --> 00:08:46.834
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

197
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:51.870
<v Speaker 2>It's very hard to to see the world and so and then psychologists will even when</v>

198
00:08:53.651 --> 00:08:55.440
<v Speaker 2>they figured out that it was hard to see world,</v>

199
00:08:55.441 --> 00:09:00.441
<v Speaker 2>they still thought that you would perceive abnormals abnormalities in the world</v>

200
00:09:00.481 --> 00:09:01.740
<v Speaker 2>that you would perceive the normally.</v>

201
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.030
<v Speaker 2>So if something strange happened,</v>

202
00:09:03.031 --> 00:09:05.010
<v Speaker 2>you'd focus your attention on it right away.</v>

203
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.780
<v Speaker 2>It turns out that's not true.</v>

204
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:07.260
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

205
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:11.460
<v Speaker 2>you can watch a video of six people throwing the basketball back and forth to</v>

206
00:09:11.461 --> 00:09:16.110
<v Speaker 2>teams of three and a gorilla could come out right in the middle of that and you</v>

207
00:09:16.111 --> 00:09:17.010
<v Speaker 2>will notice it.</v>

208
00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:17.700
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

209
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:17.791
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

210
00:09:17.791 --> 00:09:19.080
<v Speaker 2>what is going on there?</v>

211
00:09:19.081 --> 00:09:20.190
<v Speaker 2>Why won't you notice that?</v>

212
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:20.461
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

213
00:09:20.461 --> 00:09:21.000
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

214
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.730
<v Speaker 2>Why did you see that and what did he answered?</v>

215
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:27.720
<v Speaker 2>One of the answers is because you were looking at something else and so then the</v>

216
00:09:27.721 --> 00:09:28.650
<v Speaker 2>question arises.</v>

217
00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:28.980
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

218
00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:32.070
<v Speaker 2>what are you missing when you're looking at what you think is important because</v>

219
00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:35.310
<v Speaker 2>you come into the lounge and the psychologist says,</v>

220
00:09:35.311 --> 00:09:35.491
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

221
00:09:35.491 --> 00:09:38.970
<v Speaker 2>the important thing to do here is to count the basketballs and you just fall</v>

222
00:09:38.971 --> 00:09:41.640
<v Speaker 2>into that because while you're there to participate era,</v>

223
00:09:41.641 --> 00:09:42.720
<v Speaker 2>cooperative personnel,</v>

224
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:47.750
<v Speaker 2>that you swallow the story immediately and what's so interesting about the fact</v>

225
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:51.330
<v Speaker 2>that you sold the story is that as soon as you swallow the story,</v>

226
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.650
<v Speaker 2>you listened to the experiment,</v>

227
00:09:52.651 --> 00:09:54.030
<v Speaker 2>but you play out the game.</v>

228
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.630
<v Speaker 2>Then you immediately know adopting a particular cognitive perception,</v>

229
00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:00.840
<v Speaker 2>not thought it's below thought.</v>

230
00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:02.490
<v Speaker 2>It's actually what you see.</v>

231
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:07.550
<v Speaker 2>You adopt this particular sort of perception and then the world manifests itself</v>

232
00:10:07.561 --> 00:10:09.810
<v Speaker 2>to you in one way and not another,</v>

233
00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:14.250
<v Speaker 2>and it isn't necessarily the way that you would think and it makes this</v>

234
00:10:14.251 --> 00:10:14.731
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>

235
00:10:14.731 --> 00:10:15.564
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

236
00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:18.600
<v Speaker 2>what are you missing when you're aiming at what you're aiming at,</v>

237
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:20.940
<v Speaker 2>and that's what that is.</v>

238
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.680
<v Speaker 2>You might be missing almost everything.</v>

239
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:24.300
<v Speaker 2>That's what it looks like.</v>

240
00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.060
<v Speaker 2>So Simon did another experiment.</v>

241
00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:29.100
<v Speaker 2>This was even more amazing experiments.</v>

242
00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.970
<v Speaker 2>He did this in Harvard Yard and there's lots of tourists in Harvard Yard.</v>

243
00:10:32.971 --> 00:10:33.990
<v Speaker 2>It's a place where people go.</v>

244
00:10:33.991 --> 00:10:35.460
<v Speaker 2>It's a very cool place actually.</v>

245
00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:37.910
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

246
00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:41.700
<v Speaker 2>and there's undergraduate smelly all around him in Harvard Yard with the</v>

247
00:10:41.701 --> 00:10:43.920
<v Speaker 2>tourists because it's a university.</v>

248
00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.580
<v Speaker 2>And so what Simon did was he was wondering,</v>

249
00:10:47.581 --> 00:10:47.701
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

250
00:10:47.701 --> 00:10:49.220
<v Speaker 2>just how blind people are,</v>

251
00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.460
<v Speaker 2>how blind people.</v>

252
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.950
<v Speaker 2>They won't see a gorilla when it's right in front of them.</v>

253
00:10:52.951 --> 00:10:53.790
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty blind.</v>

254
00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:56.390
<v Speaker 2>Let's try another trigger.</v>

255
00:10:56.550 --> 00:11:01.550
<v Speaker 2>So what he did was he sent out undergraduates to ask tourists for directions</v>

256
00:11:01.591 --> 00:11:02.580
<v Speaker 2>with a map.</v>

257
00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.670
<v Speaker 2>So imagine tourists to standing here.</v>

258
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:07.590
<v Speaker 2>Undergraduate is standing here,</v>

259
00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:11.420
<v Speaker 2>undergraduate has map asks tourist where,</v>

260
00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:12.180
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

261
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:13.920
<v Speaker 2>where things are in the article.</v>

262
00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:14.641
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

263
00:11:14.641 --> 00:11:16.950
<v Speaker 2>so person standing here versus down here.</v>

264
00:11:16.951 --> 00:11:17.620
<v Speaker 2>Now some work.</v>

265
00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:22.620
<v Speaker 2>We would come by two of them and they're carrying that door like this.</v>

266
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:28.040
<v Speaker 2>And they hear the door and they routinely walk right between the tourist and the</v>

267
00:11:28.751 --> 00:11:29.400
<v Speaker 2>undergraduate,</v>

268
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.480
<v Speaker 2>walk right between them.</v>

269
00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:35.430
<v Speaker 2>And then as the undergraduate is blocked from the tour view,</v>

270
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.200
<v Speaker 2>the undergraduate grabs,</v>

271
00:11:37.201 --> 00:11:38.040
<v Speaker 2>the door,</v>

272
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:39.600
<v Speaker 2>keeps on walking,</v>

273
00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:45.020
<v Speaker 2>and one of the people that was holding the door grabs it and starts talking to</v>

274
00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:46.290
<v Speaker 2>the tourists.</v>

275
00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:51.830
<v Speaker 2>So Dan figured out how to swap the person and about 60 percent of the people who</v>

276
00:11:53.291 --> 00:11:54.300
<v Speaker 2>were giving you extra stuff.</v>

277
00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:59.300
<v Speaker 2>The undergraduate didn't notice that they were talking to a different person.</v>

278
00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:00.020
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

279
00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:00.970
<v Speaker 2>so what does that imply?</v>

280
00:12:00.971 --> 00:12:03.820
<v Speaker 2>It implies that like you're out there in the world talking to people and they're</v>

281
00:12:03.821 --> 00:12:07.360
<v Speaker 2>just shifting into different people right in front of you you don't even notice.</v>

282
00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:12.310
<v Speaker 2>And then he did it in a like a convenience store.</v>

283
00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:16.480
<v Speaker 2>And so he would have people come in and interact with the convenience store</v>

284
00:12:16.481 --> 00:12:20.110
<v Speaker 2>owner and the convenience store owner were ducked down behind the counter to</v>

285
00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:22.750
<v Speaker 2>grab something and then a different person would pop up.</v>

286
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:24.303
<v Speaker 2>Again.</v>

287
00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:28.810
<v Speaker 2>More than half of the people didn't notice that it was a different person.</v>

288
00:12:28.811 --> 00:12:33.370
<v Speaker 2>That was even if they were wearing different colored clothing and you think,</v>

289
00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:33.521
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

290
00:12:33.521 --> 00:12:34.450
<v Speaker 2>what does this mean?</v>

291
00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.470
<v Speaker 2>What does this,</v>

292
00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:36.820
<v Speaker 2>what does this mean?</v>

293
00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:39.730
<v Speaker 2>It means that you don't see any more of the world.</v>

294
00:12:39.731 --> 00:12:42.970
<v Speaker 2>Then you need to see in order to get what you're aiming at.</v>

295
00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:45.100
<v Speaker 2>That's what it means.</v>

296
00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:46.690
<v Speaker 2>It really,</v>

297
00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:50.740
<v Speaker 2>really literally means that you actually don't see it.</v>

298
00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.200
<v Speaker 2>It's not that you don't remember it.</v>

299
00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:54.950
<v Speaker 2>It's not that you don't think about it.</v>

300
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:58.110
<v Speaker 2>It's that you're physically incapable of seeing,</v>

301
00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:02.140
<v Speaker 2>and this experiment has been replicated in many,</v>

302
00:13:02.141 --> 00:13:02.974
<v Speaker 2>many ways.</v>

303
00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:07.390
<v Speaker 2>If I took you out of the room one by one out of the room that you're sitting in</v>

304
00:13:07.391 --> 00:13:07.781
<v Speaker 2>and I said,</v>

305
00:13:07.781 --> 00:13:07.871
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

306
00:13:07.871 --> 00:13:09.070
<v Speaker 2>what color was the floor?</v>

307
00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.930
<v Speaker 2>Because can't tell right now because it's dark,</v>

308
00:13:10.931 --> 00:13:11.591
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't dark.</v>

309
00:13:11.591 --> 00:13:12.670
<v Speaker 2>When you came in here,</v>

310
00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:16.570
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't remember what color the Flores and the reason for that is,</v>

311
00:13:16.571 --> 00:13:18.130
<v Speaker 2>you actually don't care.</v>

312
00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.640
<v Speaker 2>What do you care about with regards to a floor?</v>

313
00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:22.790
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

314
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:24.700
<v Speaker 2>mostly you care that it doesn't move.</v>

315
00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:27.070
<v Speaker 2>You don't want the floor to move.</v>

316
00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:31.960
<v Speaker 2>That's a bad thing and so as long as it doesn't move,</v>

317
00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:36.310
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to perceive it and that's sort of the rule.</v>

318
00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:38.710
<v Speaker 2>And why don't you want the Florida move?</v>

319
00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:40.053
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

320
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:42.820
<v Speaker 2>what does it signify if the floor moves?</v>

321
00:13:42.821 --> 00:13:47.020
<v Speaker 2>Well probably signifies that maybe there's an earthquake and that's a bad thing.</v>

322
00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:48.160
<v Speaker 2>That's a seriously bad thing.</v>

323
00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:51.220
<v Speaker 2>I was in a hotel once and I was looking at.</v>

324
00:13:51.221 --> 00:13:53.380
<v Speaker 2>This was a scientific convention.</v>

325
00:13:53.381 --> 00:13:54.520
<v Speaker 2>I was looking at this.</v>

326
00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:57.100
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of like an advertisement for a scientific paper.</v>

327
00:13:57.101 --> 00:13:58.120
<v Speaker 2>They're called posters.</v>

328
00:13:58.530 --> 00:13:59.630
<v Speaker 2>They're little advert there.</v>

329
00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:04.480
<v Speaker 2>Advertisements for scientific papers and you put yours up on this like wall</v>

330
00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.730
<v Speaker 2>board room divider.</v>

331
00:14:06.731 --> 00:14:11.731
<v Speaker 2>Basically dependent upon people come by and ask questions about your experiment</v>

332
00:14:12.341 --> 00:14:14.560
<v Speaker 2>and all of a sudden I fell over.</v>

333
00:14:14.561 --> 00:14:18.450
<v Speaker 2>I was knocked off balance and the reason I was balances because the wall beside</v>

334
00:14:18.451 --> 00:14:18.881
<v Speaker 2>me moved.</v>

335
00:14:18.881 --> 00:14:21.250
<v Speaker 2>It was a big hotel and the wool move.</v>

336
00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.130
<v Speaker 2>You do not expect that.</v>

337
00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:25.930
<v Speaker 2>Do not expect that a move toward a bath.</v>

338
00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:26.381
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

339
00:14:26.381 --> 00:14:30.010
<v Speaker 2>it turned out that they have movable wall who knew?</v>

340
00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:30.551
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

341
00:14:30.551 --> 00:14:33.100
<v Speaker 2>But it was one of these dividable rooms and so.</v>

342
00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:36.880
<v Speaker 2>But it took me off guard so badly that it just about knocked me over,</v>

343
00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:38.290
<v Speaker 2>but normally I wouldn't even.</v>

344
00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:39.910
<v Speaker 2>I was already at myself in the room.</v>

345
00:14:39.911 --> 00:14:40.810
<v Speaker 2>Normally I wouldn't even.</v>

346
00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:42.040
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't even pay attention.</v>

347
00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:44.710
<v Speaker 2>You don't pay attention to anything that doesn't get in your way.</v>

348
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:47.590
<v Speaker 2>Now that's an interesting thing.</v>

349
00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:52.770
<v Speaker 2>That's an interesting thing because you see the question is what do you see when</v>

350
00:14:53.181 --> 00:14:53.921
<v Speaker 2>you look at the world?</v>

351
00:14:53.921 --> 00:14:54.754
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

352
00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:55.813
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

353
00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:59.750
<v Speaker 2>now we're going to take this apart because it's unbelievably important this.</v>

354
00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:01.143
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

355
00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:08.370
<v Speaker 2>when you're watching the basketballs,</v>

356
00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:13.500
<v Speaker 2>you use the central point of your vision to process the visual field.</v>

357
00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.300
<v Speaker 2>Now you can.</v>

358
00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:17.670
<v Speaker 2>You can kind of detect this yourself.</v>

359
00:15:17.671 --> 00:15:22.671
<v Speaker 2>Like if I look at this gentleman in the front row and I looked at his eyes and I</v>

360
00:15:23.401 --> 00:15:25.390
<v Speaker 2>can see his eyes and I can see his face in it,</v>

361
00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:27.060
<v Speaker 2>quite high resolution,</v>

362
00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:31.920
<v Speaker 2>but if I look at him and I pay attention to the people to assign from looking at</v>

363
00:15:31.921 --> 00:15:32.550
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

364
00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:36.450
<v Speaker 2>what I notice is that the farther out of the center of my seal division,</v>

365
00:15:36.451 --> 00:15:37.320
<v Speaker 2>those people become,</v>

366
00:15:37.321 --> 00:15:38.520
<v Speaker 2>the less I can really see them.</v>

367
00:15:38.521 --> 00:15:40.860
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm pointing at a woman,</v>

368
00:15:40.861 --> 00:15:41.640
<v Speaker 2>I think here,</v>

369
00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:44.190
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell because I'm looking at the guy right in front of me.</v>

370
00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:45.930
<v Speaker 2>I think she's dressed in red,</v>

371
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:48.690
<v Speaker 2>but I can't see you there.</v>

372
00:15:48.691 --> 00:15:49.830
<v Speaker 2>I know you're a human being,</v>

373
00:15:49.831 --> 00:15:54.831
<v Speaker 2>but I can't see your face and you people over there basically just blurs and I</v>

374
00:15:54.871 --> 00:15:56.070
<v Speaker 2>know that you're there,</v>

375
00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:59.520
<v Speaker 2>but of course when I point I want to look because then I can see you,</v>

376
00:15:59.521 --> 00:16:01.140
<v Speaker 2>but looking at you and you,</v>

377
00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:02.370
<v Speaker 2>you guys are low resolution.</v>

378
00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:06.390
<v Speaker 2>You're like simpsons characters except you're in the black and white and I can't</v>

379
00:16:06.391 --> 00:16:07.224
<v Speaker 2>even tell that.</v>

380
00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:08.370
<v Speaker 2>It's just so.</v>

381
00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.350
<v Speaker 2>Even in the periphery of your vision,</v>

382
00:16:10.351 --> 00:16:11.280
<v Speaker 2>things are black and white.</v>

383
00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:12.750
<v Speaker 2>You can't tell that,</v>

384
00:16:12.751 --> 00:16:17.160
<v Speaker 2>but that's the case and mostly over in the periphery you don't see things unless</v>

385
00:16:17.161 --> 00:16:17.850
<v Speaker 2>they move.</v>

386
00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:21.410
<v Speaker 2>You know how in Jurassic Park dinosaurs didn't see anything and listen,</v>

387
00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:22.231
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

388
00:16:22.231 --> 00:16:25.110
<v Speaker 2>that's what your vision is like in the periphery because you don't have much</v>

389
00:16:25.111 --> 00:16:26.100
<v Speaker 2>brain power over there.</v>

390
00:16:26.101 --> 00:16:26.731
<v Speaker 2>In the periphery,</v>

391
00:16:26.731 --> 00:16:27.310
<v Speaker 2>you can.</v>

392
00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:31.530
<v Speaker 2>You're not that up and so the way that your brain is that essentially</v>

393
00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:36.680
<v Speaker 2>compensates for your lack of visual Cortex is by only allowing you to see things</v>

394
00:16:36.841 --> 00:16:37.620
<v Speaker 2>that move,</v>

395
00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:38.341
<v Speaker 2>something moves in,</v>

396
00:16:38.341 --> 00:16:40.320
<v Speaker 2>periphery Gloria towards it and look at it,</v>

397
00:16:40.321 --> 00:16:40.861
<v Speaker 2>and then you think,</v>

398
00:16:40.861 --> 00:16:41.011
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

399
00:16:41.011 --> 00:16:41.980
<v Speaker 2>I saw that all along.</v>

400
00:16:41.981 --> 00:16:42.970
<v Speaker 2>It's he did.</v>

401
00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.610
<v Speaker 2>You saw a brief flash of movement.</v>

402
00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:47.370
<v Speaker 2>You actually use different parts of your brain process,</v>

403
00:16:47.371 --> 00:16:48.780
<v Speaker 2>different parts of your visual field.</v>

404
00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:50.453
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

405
00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:51.631
<v Speaker 2>when you're.</v>

406
00:16:51.631 --> 00:16:52.770
<v Speaker 2>When you're looking at the basketball,</v>

407
00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:53.613
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

408
00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:53.821
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

409
00:16:53.821 --> 00:16:54.720
<v Speaker 2>what is it exactly?</v>

410
00:16:54.721 --> 00:16:58.650
<v Speaker 2>What exactly is going on when you're looking at that basketball and that</v>

411
00:16:58.660 --> 00:16:59.430
<v Speaker 2>experimenter?</v>

412
00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:00.450
<v Speaker 2>Well first of all,</v>

413
00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:04.020
<v Speaker 2>you're playing the role because the role is experiment,</v>

414
00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:09.050
<v Speaker 2>experiment the subject and it's a little drama and the drama and the</v>

415
00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:14.340
<v Speaker 2>experimenter to when the experimenter is basically the costs where you treat him</v>

416
00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:16.990
<v Speaker 2>or her like a higher status private.</v>

417
00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:22.460
<v Speaker 2>Your job is to listen to them and to take instructions and that's essentially to</v>

418
00:17:22.471 --> 00:17:23.010
<v Speaker 2>a dog.</v>

419
00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:27.300
<v Speaker 2>The story were the role that they tell you to play and you'll do that because</v>

420
00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:28.890
<v Speaker 2>when you volunteered for the experiment,</v>

421
00:17:28.891 --> 00:17:30.990
<v Speaker 2>you're already in for that experience.</v>

422
00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:32.400
<v Speaker 2>Just exactly as I said,</v>

423
00:17:32.401 --> 00:17:36.180
<v Speaker 2>just as all of you in some sense volunteered to come here and you do what the</v>

424
00:17:36.181 --> 00:17:37.450
<v Speaker 2>route tells you.</v>

425
00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:41.490
<v Speaker 2>The room is set up so that the seats face this way and so you come in here and</v>

426
00:17:41.491 --> 00:17:42.600
<v Speaker 2>you obey the room.</v>

427
00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:46.890
<v Speaker 2>You see this way and it was a focal point and the focal point is this stage and</v>

428
00:17:46.891 --> 00:17:51.891
<v Speaker 2>then room implies that what's is going to take place on the stage and you're</v>

429
00:17:52.171 --> 00:17:53.190
<v Speaker 2>here for that experience,</v>

430
00:17:53.191 --> 00:17:58.191
<v Speaker 2>so you focus on me at the moment and hopefully the deal is that I tell you</v>

431
00:17:59.041 --> 00:18:02.350
<v Speaker 2>things that are interesting because that's what the room is set up to allow to</v>

432
00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:06.130
<v Speaker 2>happen and so all of that shapes your perceptions in a very,</v>

433
00:18:06.131 --> 00:18:06.964
<v Speaker 2>very direct way.</v>

434
00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:10.800
<v Speaker 2>And when you go into this lab and Dan tells you to sit down and count the</v>

435
00:18:10.801 --> 00:18:11.700
<v Speaker 2>basketballs,</v>

436
00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:13.860
<v Speaker 2>your experimental subject,</v>

437
00:18:13.861 --> 00:18:15.570
<v Speaker 2>you're civilized human being.</v>

438
00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.070
<v Speaker 2>You're obedient person.</v>

439
00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:18.660
<v Speaker 2>You're a good sport.</v>

440
00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:20.550
<v Speaker 2>He's the authority figure.</v>

441
00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:24.630
<v Speaker 2>The context of the university is set up to sort of hammer that home.</v>

442
00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:28.020
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to tell them to go to hell and when he asks you to watch the</v>

443
00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.100
<v Speaker 2>basketball,</v>

444
00:18:29.101 --> 00:18:31.050
<v Speaker 2>unless you're unbelievably antisocial,</v>

445
00:18:31.051 --> 00:18:32.370
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to do that.</v>

446
00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:37.550
<v Speaker 2>So it's a drama that you're undertaking and he offers you a value system.</v>

447
00:18:37.771 --> 00:18:41.520
<v Speaker 2>And the value system is something like if you're a good person,</v>

448
00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:47.300
<v Speaker 2>you follow instructions when the system is set up so that following instructions</v>

449
00:18:47.581 --> 00:18:51.840
<v Speaker 2>is the civilized thing to do and to act out that stability.</v>

450
00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:56.870
<v Speaker 2>You sit in that chair and I give you a set of stage instructions about how you</v>

451
00:18:58.771 --> 00:19:02.820
<v Speaker 2>should act and then you act them out and you agree to do that.</v>

452
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:07.380
<v Speaker 2>And then that establishes your perceptual set and that determines what's</v>

453
00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:11.340
<v Speaker 2>important in the world and that determines what manifests itself in the world.</v>

454
00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:13.320
<v Speaker 2>And so then you count the basketballs even though,</v>

455
00:19:13.321 --> 00:19:15.210
<v Speaker 2>why the hell are you counting basketballs?</v>

456
00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:18.150
<v Speaker 2>There's no particular reason except we want to do a good job.</v>

457
00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:20.500
<v Speaker 2>And because of that you miss what's vital.</v>

458
00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:25.050
<v Speaker 2>So that's the extended version of the,</v>

459
00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:26.070
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>

460
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:26.910
<v Speaker 2>of the narrative.</v>

461
00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:33.510
<v Speaker 2>So now if the griller would've jumped up and swipe the ball and you were</v>

462
00:19:33.511 --> 00:19:34.344
<v Speaker 2>counting it,</v>

463
00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:36.030
<v Speaker 2>you would have seen it.</v>

464
00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:39.150
<v Speaker 2>If things get in your way that you see them.</v>

465
00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:42.000
<v Speaker 2>So then let's figure out what you see.</v>

466
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:44.970
<v Speaker 2>So when I look at someone,</v>

467
00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:46.830
<v Speaker 2>again personal in the front row,</v>

468
00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:51.480
<v Speaker 2>I generally look at their face and we generally look at other people's spaces</v>

469
00:19:51.481 --> 00:19:52.320
<v Speaker 2>when we talked to them.</v>

470
00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:55.170
<v Speaker 2>And we're very good at facial recognition by the way.</v>

471
00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:57.720
<v Speaker 2>You have specialized brain areas for,</v>

472
00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.730
<v Speaker 2>for recognizing faces and faces,</v>

473
00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:04.760
<v Speaker 2>broadcast emotion and intent and like your face is like a video screen important</v>

474
00:20:05.131 --> 00:20:09.210
<v Speaker 2>which emotions play and you want to pay attention to someone's emotions and</v>

475
00:20:09.211 --> 00:20:12.750
<v Speaker 2>motivational states and you can see them broadcast them on their face because</v>

476
00:20:12.751 --> 00:20:15.750
<v Speaker 2>then you know what they're up to and you want to know what they're up to because</v>

477
00:20:15.751 --> 00:20:20.490
<v Speaker 2>God only knows what they're up to and you want to make sure that what they're up</v>

478
00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:23.490
<v Speaker 2>to is something that you would want them to be up to when you're around.</v>

479
00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:27.420
<v Speaker 2>So you're watching their face and what you really want is their eyes.</v>

480
00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:30.060
<v Speaker 2>And here's something really cool about human eyes.</v>

481
00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.770
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

482
00:20:31.771 --> 00:20:34.620
<v Speaker 2>we have whites around our hooks,</v>

483
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:35.010
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

484
00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:36.750
<v Speaker 2>And the whites are white,</v>

485
00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:38.580
<v Speaker 2>hence their name,</v>

486
00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:39.930
<v Speaker 2>the whites of the eyes,</v>

487
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:44.250
<v Speaker 2>but like lots of the animals that were closely related to don't have lights like</v>

488
00:20:44.251 --> 00:20:45.084
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

489
00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:46.800
<v Speaker 2>So gorillas don't for example,</v>

490
00:20:46.801 --> 00:20:51.310
<v Speaker 2>but beings really do like our iris is really stand out against the white</v>

491
00:20:51.311 --> 00:20:53.650
<v Speaker 2>background and there's a reason for that.</v>

492
00:20:53.651 --> 00:20:57.400
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is what we really want to see when we look at someone</v>

493
00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:58.240
<v Speaker 2>else's,</v>

494
00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.020
<v Speaker 2>what the hell are they pointing their eyes out?</v>

495
00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:02.650
<v Speaker 2>And so there's a famous social psychology experiment,</v>

496
00:21:02.651 --> 00:21:06.940
<v Speaker 2>which is really a comical one where someone stands on the corner of a street,</v>

497
00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:10.230
<v Speaker 2>just looks up like this and if you just,</v>

498
00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:11.021
<v Speaker 2>you can do this,</v>

499
00:21:11.021 --> 00:21:11.500
<v Speaker 2>you can be.</v>

500
00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:16.390
<v Speaker 2>The scientist is go out on the street going the corner and just look up and soon</v>

501
00:21:16.391 --> 00:21:19.950
<v Speaker 2>someone will come by and they'll look at you and you will look at them.</v>

502
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:21.940
<v Speaker 2>That's part of the trick.</v>

503
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.260
<v Speaker 2>You won't look at them and they'll say,</v>

504
00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:25.390
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

505
00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:28.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty important and that person is looking at me.</v>

506
00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:29.591
<v Speaker 2>And so whatever.</v>

507
00:21:29.591 --> 00:21:32.140
<v Speaker 2>What that means is that whatever they're looking at must be important,</v>

508
00:21:32.141 --> 00:21:33.550
<v Speaker 2>more important than me,</v>

509
00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:35.440
<v Speaker 2>and that must mean it's pretty important,</v>

510
00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:36.960
<v Speaker 2>so I better look Joe,</v>

511
00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:41.020
<v Speaker 2>so then someone will join you and look up as well,</v>

512
00:21:41.021 --> 00:21:43.180
<v Speaker 2>and they were trying to figure out what you're looking at,</v>

513
00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:47.110
<v Speaker 2>but then of course there's two of you looking out there and that's kind of</v>

514
00:21:47.111 --> 00:21:50.800
<v Speaker 2>abnormal behavior on the street and so then the third person comes along and</v>

515
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:54.700
<v Speaker 2>there's two people standing on the street looking so you better know and so then</v>

516
00:21:54.701 --> 00:21:57.730
<v Speaker 2>there's three p and you can soon you can get a crowd of people looking,</v>

517
00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.900
<v Speaker 2>which is actually a good thing to do in a metaphysical sense.</v>

518
00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.770
<v Speaker 2>This crowd of people.</v>

519
00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:08.660
<v Speaker 2>So that's what we're doing tonight.</v>

520
00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:10.780
<v Speaker 2>Crowd of people to look up.</v>

521
00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.280
<v Speaker 2>That's really what we're doing tonight,</v>

522
00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:13.480
<v Speaker 2>but that anyways.</v>

523
00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:15.480
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

524
00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:15.691
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

525
00:22:15.691 --> 00:22:18.310
<v Speaker 2>the reason that you look at people's eyes is because you want to see what</v>

526
00:22:18.311 --> 00:22:19.144
<v Speaker 2>they're looking at.</v>

527
00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.490
<v Speaker 2>Because if you can see what they're looking at,</v>

528
00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:24.700
<v Speaker 2>then you know what they think is important because it was looking at what they</v>

529
00:22:24.701 --> 00:22:25.481
<v Speaker 2>think is important.</v>

530
00:22:25.481 --> 00:22:27.730
<v Speaker 2>Because why else would you look at something if you didn't think it was</v>

531
00:22:27.731 --> 00:22:28.300
<v Speaker 2>important?</v>

532
00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:29.230
<v Speaker 2>So that's the thing.</v>

533
00:22:29.231 --> 00:22:31.630
<v Speaker 2>You look at things that you think are important.</v>

534
00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:33.161
<v Speaker 2>So that's very,</v>

535
00:22:33.161 --> 00:22:34.330
<v Speaker 2>very interesting now.</v>

536
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:36.430
<v Speaker 2>And so the biological upshot of that is,</v>

537
00:22:36.431 --> 00:22:41.060
<v Speaker 2>is that it's so important for human beings to see where other human beings are</v>

538
00:22:41.061 --> 00:22:43.690
<v Speaker 2>appointing their eyes that all of our ancestors,</v>

539
00:22:43.691 --> 00:22:47.320
<v Speaker 2>they didn't have sharply defined irises against the white background,</v>

540
00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:49.660
<v Speaker 2>either got killed or didn't reproduce.</v>

541
00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:54.460
<v Speaker 2>I get seriously important and so I contact is unbelievably important and our</v>

542
00:22:54.461 --> 00:22:58.990
<v Speaker 2>visual systems are specialized so that we can detect tiny,</v>

543
00:22:58.991 --> 00:23:03.550
<v Speaker 2>tiny deviations in someone else's glass like you would been know from across the</v>

544
00:23:03.551 --> 00:23:04.270
<v Speaker 2>room.</v>

545
00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:05.740
<v Speaker 2>When someone is looking at you,</v>

546
00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:06.531
<v Speaker 2>you look at them,</v>

547
00:23:06.531 --> 00:23:08.650
<v Speaker 2>you think you catch each other's eyes.</v>

548
00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:09.420
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

549
00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:10.480
<v Speaker 2>and you know that,</v>

550
00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:11.230
<v Speaker 2>that there's,</v>

551
00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:11.970
<v Speaker 2>there's interest.</v>

552
00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:12.500
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

553
00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:13.960
<v Speaker 2>that's what I contact signifies.</v>

554
00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:15.123
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

555
00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:17.180
<v Speaker 2>there've been SMRI studies.</v>

556
00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:20.790
<v Speaker 2>So FM arise at technology that allows you to scan the brain as it's operating.</v>

557
00:23:20.791 --> 00:23:22.060
<v Speaker 2>Then if you,</v>

558
00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:22.790
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

559
00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:23.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

560
00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:24.310
<v Speaker 2>if you show men,</v>

561
00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:25.600
<v Speaker 2>this is mostly been done with men,</v>

562
00:23:25.601 --> 00:23:28.550
<v Speaker 2>but not only if you show men mentioned,</v>

563
00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:30.090
<v Speaker 2>you show me a picture,</v>

564
00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:31.270
<v Speaker 2>the same woman,</v>

565
00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:31.521
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

566
00:23:31.521 --> 00:23:35.230
<v Speaker 2>In one picture the woman is looking off to the left or to the right,</v>

567
00:23:35.231 --> 00:23:36.130
<v Speaker 2>doesn't matter.</v>

568
00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:38.500
<v Speaker 2>And in the other picture she's looking directly out.</v>

569
00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:40.270
<v Speaker 2>So she's making eye contact,</v>

570
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:42.660
<v Speaker 2>at least in principle with the map.</v>

571
00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:46.310
<v Speaker 2>If the woman,</v>

572
00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:49.880
<v Speaker 2>this is generally an attractive woman in these experiments,</v>

573
00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.740
<v Speaker 2>if the woman is making eye contact with Amanda,</v>

574
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.660
<v Speaker 2>then the gays will activate part of his brain.</v>

575
00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:59.720
<v Speaker 2>It's associated with moving towards things,</v>

576
00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:00.920
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

577
00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:05.150
<v Speaker 2>And so that's why I contact his pickup maneuver in a bar.</v>

578
00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:08.270
<v Speaker 2>So because you latch onto someone,</v>

579
00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:09.800
<v Speaker 2>you know and the timing has to be right,</v>

580
00:24:09.801 --> 00:24:12.320
<v Speaker 2>but if you latch onto someone visually,</v>

581
00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:15.140
<v Speaker 2>then that can be interpreted as a,</v>

582
00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:18.080
<v Speaker 2>as interest in that can be interpreted as an invitation.</v>

583
00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:18.261
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

584
00:24:18.261 --> 00:24:19.011
<v Speaker 2>everyone knows that.</v>

585
00:24:19.011 --> 00:24:19.430
<v Speaker 2>Maybe not.</v>

586
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:20.720
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's not an invitation.</v>

587
00:24:20.721 --> 00:24:24.920
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you're just thinking that guy has the ugliest tie I've ever seen in my</v>

588
00:24:24.921 --> 00:24:25.640
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

589
00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:25.881
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

590
00:24:25.881 --> 00:24:27.530
<v Speaker 2>And then of course he comes over and talks to you,</v>

591
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:31.280
<v Speaker 2>that's just not good because you don't want to talk to someone with the ugliest</v>

592
00:24:31.281 --> 00:24:32.360
<v Speaker 2>tie that you've ever seen.</v>

593
00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:33.080
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

594
00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:34.490
<v Speaker 2>But in any case,</v>

595
00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:35.830
<v Speaker 2>it's an invitation.</v>

596
00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:40.100
<v Speaker 2>You can see the strange manifestations of that and all sorts of places you</v>

597
00:24:40.101 --> 00:24:41.630
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't necessarily expect it.</v>

598
00:24:41.631 --> 00:24:42.321
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

599
00:24:42.321 --> 00:24:45.080
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that has always fascinated me,</v>

600
00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:45.680
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

601
00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:46.513
<v Speaker 2>that's not true.</v>

602
00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:51.670
<v Speaker 2>Some fascinates me from time to time I go into say into a drug store and you see</v>

603
00:24:52.131 --> 00:24:57.131
<v Speaker 2>all the magazines in a raid there and what's the most common picture on the</v>

604
00:24:57.741 --> 00:24:59.090
<v Speaker 2>cover of a magazine?</v>

605
00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:00.980
<v Speaker 2>It's an attractive woman.</v>

606
00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:02.080
<v Speaker 2>It's almost always doesn't matter.</v>

607
00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:05.780
<v Speaker 2>It's a women's magazine or man's magazine and she's looking directly at you.</v>

608
00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:09.860
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is that if a magazine has that image on the cover,</v>

609
00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:11.510
<v Speaker 2>then people will go over to it,</v>

610
00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:12.680
<v Speaker 2>approach it,</v>

611
00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:13.640
<v Speaker 2>which is what you want.</v>

612
00:25:13.641 --> 00:25:14.451
<v Speaker 2>If you're a magazine,</v>

613
00:25:14.451 --> 00:25:14.680
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

614
00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:19.550
<v Speaker 2>We want people to approach you because then they pick you up and they buy you.</v>

615
00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:24.970
<v Speaker 2>And so magazines evolve in some sense to have the maximally attractive figure on</v>

616
00:25:27.351 --> 00:25:27.771
<v Speaker 2>the cover.</v>

617
00:25:27.771 --> 00:25:32.360
<v Speaker 2>Because all the magazines that don't have that die and so that's why the</v>

618
00:25:32.361 --> 00:25:33.590
<v Speaker 2>magazines ended up that way,</v>

619
00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:38.740
<v Speaker 2>and so the part of the brain that is activated by that direct eye gaze is called</v>

620
00:25:39.291 --> 00:25:44.291
<v Speaker 2>the nucleus accumbens and it's a brain area that is integrally involved in the</v>

621
00:25:48.411 --> 00:25:50.130
<v Speaker 2>neuro neuro chemicals.</v>

622
00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:55.600
<v Speaker 2>What it's part of the material substrate of the neurochemical system that uses</v>

623
00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:56.990
<v Speaker 2>the neurochemical,</v>

624
00:25:57.210 --> 00:26:00.920
<v Speaker 2>dopamine and dope mean mediates approach behavior,</v>

625
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:02.220
<v Speaker 2>but also importantly,</v>

626
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:07.230
<v Speaker 2>the open meeting is also the chemical that's who's released is facilitated by</v>

627
00:26:08.301 --> 00:26:11.980
<v Speaker 2>drugs like cocaine or methamphetamine,</v>

628
00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:12.561
<v Speaker 2>which are very,</v>

629
00:26:12.561 --> 00:26:13.670
<v Speaker 2>very addictive.</v>

630
00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:17.420
<v Speaker 2>And the thing that's so interesting about that is that those sorts of addictive</v>

631
00:26:17.421 --> 00:26:21.140
<v Speaker 2>drugs make you feel like you're approaching worthwhile things.</v>

632
00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:22.520
<v Speaker 2>That's why they're so addictive.</v>

633
00:26:22.521 --> 00:26:25.400
<v Speaker 2>So if your life is meaningless and you take cocaine,</v>

634
00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:29.930
<v Speaker 2>then it feels like you're imbued with a sense of purpose and that that can be</v>

635
00:26:29.931 --> 00:26:30.764
<v Speaker 2>addictive.</v>

636
00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:31.521
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>

637
00:26:31.521 --> 00:26:33.620
<v Speaker 2>that's the definition of addictive in some sense.</v>

638
00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:36.860
<v Speaker 2>And so for a neuro chemical substance to be addictive,</v>

639
00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:40.220
<v Speaker 2>it has to give you the sense that you're pursuing something of value.</v>

640
00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:43.430
<v Speaker 2>And so then if you show people stimuli,</v>

641
00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.960
<v Speaker 2>that's a phenomena that make them want to approach,</v>

642
00:26:45.961 --> 00:26:47.610
<v Speaker 2>then you activate that part of the brain.</v>

643
00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:48.953
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

644
00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:53.640
<v Speaker 2>so now if if I'm watching someone and I can see what they're looking at,</v>

645
00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:55.560
<v Speaker 2>and then I can look at it too,</v>

646
00:26:55.620 --> 00:27:00.570
<v Speaker 2>then I know what they think is important and if I can infer what they're,</v>

647
00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:01.230
<v Speaker 2>what they're,</v>

648
00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:02.610
<v Speaker 2>what they think is important,</v>

649
00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:07.710
<v Speaker 2>then I can embody who they are in my body and that's how I understand that.</v>

650
00:27:07.711 --> 00:27:11.640
<v Speaker 2>So if I can see what you think is important because you're looking at it and I</v>

651
00:27:11.641 --> 00:27:12.480
<v Speaker 2>can look at it,</v>

652
00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:17.010
<v Speaker 2>then I can adopt that frame of reference and then I can read off my body what</v>

653
00:27:17.011 --> 00:27:17.760
<v Speaker 2>you're feeling.</v>

654
00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:19.590
<v Speaker 2>And that's how I feel what you feel.</v>

655
00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:21.120
<v Speaker 2>That's how we understand each other.</v>

656
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:22.470
<v Speaker 2>So when you know this,</v>

657
00:27:22.471 --> 00:27:23.304
<v Speaker 2>because look,</v>

658
00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:24.180
<v Speaker 2>you go to a movie,</v>

659
00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:26.400
<v Speaker 2>let's say what are you doing in a movie?</v>

660
00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:30.230
<v Speaker 2>While you're watching the hero or the villain,</v>

661
00:27:30.231 --> 00:27:30.781
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter.</v>

662
00:27:30.781 --> 00:27:35.040
<v Speaker 2>You're watching a character and you see what the characters up to.</v>

663
00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:35.940
<v Speaker 2>That's the plot.</v>

664
00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:36.541
<v Speaker 2>Essentially.</v>

665
00:27:36.541 --> 00:27:37.850
<v Speaker 2>You see what the character is up to.</v>

666
00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:41.670
<v Speaker 2>And then you adopt that frame of reference and you sit there even though you're</v>

667
00:27:41.671 --> 00:27:45.720
<v Speaker 2>sitting there and all of what's happening in that frame of reference is playing</v>

668
00:27:45.721 --> 00:27:50.100
<v Speaker 2>out in your body and your emotions and your motivations and it's all happening</v>

669
00:27:50.101 --> 00:27:54.600
<v Speaker 2>inside you like a simulation and so you get to live the curiously as a</v>

670
00:27:54.601 --> 00:27:56.610
<v Speaker 2>consequence of adopting the frame of reference.</v>

671
00:27:56.611 --> 00:28:00.420
<v Speaker 2>If the person that's in the fictional landscape and that's why you like fiction</v>

672
00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:04.490
<v Speaker 2>because you can go and watch a fictional representation or you can read a novel.</v>

673
00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:05.370
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter,</v>

674
00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:06.050
<v Speaker 2>whatever the.</v>

675
00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:11.050
<v Speaker 2>Wherever you can find a story and then you can pick up the reference frame of</v>

676
00:28:11.641 --> 00:28:15.420
<v Speaker 2>the character in the story and then you can have the story.</v>

677
00:28:15.421 --> 00:28:19.560
<v Speaker 2>You can sit there and learn everything there is to learn about that story just</v>

678
00:28:19.561 --> 00:28:24.561
<v Speaker 2>by being passive and so smart because if the hero does something stupid and ends</v>

679
00:28:25.111 --> 00:28:26.190
<v Speaker 2>up dead,</v>

680
00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:30.180
<v Speaker 2>then you could think while I think if you adopt that frame of reference,</v>

681
00:28:30.181 --> 00:28:33.750
<v Speaker 2>then you do something stupid and you end up debt and then if you're smart,</v>

682
00:28:33.751 --> 00:28:36.200
<v Speaker 2>you don't do it because you'll end up dead.</v>

683
00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:38.100
<v Speaker 2>Why bother with that?</v>

684
00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:39.390
<v Speaker 2>Because you don't have to,</v>

685
00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:40.920
<v Speaker 2>and so it's like thinking,</v>

686
00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:41.340
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

687
00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:43.170
<v Speaker 2>Because here's a way of thinking about thinking.</v>

688
00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:44.820
<v Speaker 2>Alfred North Whitehead said,</v>

689
00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:50.280
<v Speaker 2>we think so that our thoughts can die instead of us,</v>

690
00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:53.070
<v Speaker 2>which is so smart.</v>

691
00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:58.220
<v Speaker 2>It's like when animals try to adapt to the world the way they do it because they</v>

692
00:28:58.291 --> 00:29:03.291
<v Speaker 2>can't really think like weekend what an animal does to adapt to the world.</v>

693
00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:04.740
<v Speaker 2>He's made a whole bunch more animals.</v>

694
00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:05.850
<v Speaker 2>That's production,</v>

695
00:29:05.851 --> 00:29:06.061
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

696
00:29:06.061 --> 00:29:08.130
<v Speaker 2>So the mosquito wants to adapt to the world.</v>

697
00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:13.020
<v Speaker 2>It has like 10,000 mosquito offspring and they all definitely a little bit</v>

698
00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.033
<v Speaker 2>randomly.</v>

699
00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:17.010
<v Speaker 2>That's random variation and most of them aren't successful.</v>

700
00:29:17.011 --> 00:29:18.180
<v Speaker 2>They just die.</v>

701
00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:20.130
<v Speaker 2>But it doesn't matter because if you're a mosquito,</v>

702
00:29:20.131 --> 00:29:23.550
<v Speaker 2>you only need to produce one mosquito in your lifetime to keep the whole</v>

703
00:29:23.551 --> 00:29:24.660
<v Speaker 2>mosquito thing going.</v>

704
00:29:24.661 --> 00:29:26.580
<v Speaker 2>And if it costs you 9,000,</v>

705
00:29:26.581 --> 00:29:28.650
<v Speaker 2>999 dead mosquitoes,</v>

706
00:29:28.651 --> 00:29:31.180
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter and it's better for the rest of us too.</v>

707
00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:31.621
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

708
00:29:31.621 --> 00:29:32.910
<v Speaker 2>but so.</v>

709
00:29:32.911 --> 00:29:37.320
<v Speaker 2>So for a mosquito's idea of an idea is to have a bunch of mosquitoes,</v>

710
00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:42.710
<v Speaker 2>but your idea of an idea as to have a bunch of avatars of and to lay them out in</v>

711
00:29:43.481 --> 00:29:47.860
<v Speaker 2>the fiction world until they had all the ones that don't do very well die and</v>

712
00:29:47.861 --> 00:29:49.800
<v Speaker 2>then to imitate the ones that survive.</v>

713
00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:53.900
<v Speaker 2>And that's part of the reason that we like stories because stories are part of</v>

714
00:29:53.910 --> 00:29:56.130
<v Speaker 2>the way we think they're way we,</v>

715
00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:59.750
<v Speaker 2>we there the way that we produce artificial variants of ourself,</v>

716
00:29:59.790 --> 00:29:59.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

717
00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:04.970
<v Speaker 2>hypothetical space so that the Darwinian process can occur in abstraction before</v>

718
00:30:05.131 --> 00:30:05.964
<v Speaker 2>we embody it.</v>

719
00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:09.630
<v Speaker 2>So it's super important and that's part of the reason that we really,</v>

720
00:30:09.631 --> 00:30:10.171
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

721
00:30:10.171 --> 00:30:14.400
<v Speaker 2>really liked stories because stories are how we live and die without having to</v>

722
00:30:14.401 --> 00:30:15.234
<v Speaker 2>live the dye.</v>

723
00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:17.730
<v Speaker 1>So that's that set.</v>

724
00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:21.410
<v Speaker 2>Without having to take the risks of real life and death.</v>

725
00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:24.830
<v Speaker 2>We can choose what we're going to embody and we're doing that all the time and</v>

726
00:30:24.831 --> 00:30:25.611
<v Speaker 2>we're sizing up.</v>

727
00:30:25.611 --> 00:30:28.670
<v Speaker 2>Other people are seeing what they're looking at to see what their frames of</v>

728
00:30:28.671 --> 00:30:29.504
<v Speaker 2>reference are,</v>

729
00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:31.720
<v Speaker 2>to see if we should adopt them for our own too.</v>

730
00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:35.810
<v Speaker 2>We want to know what they're up to and we see that people would admire and maybe</v>

731
00:30:35.811 --> 00:30:38.960
<v Speaker 2>we adopt their frame of reference because that's pushing them ahead in the world</v>

732
00:30:38.961 --> 00:30:42.620
<v Speaker 2>property and we see people we have contempt for and move away from their frame</v>

733
00:30:42.621 --> 00:30:45.950
<v Speaker 2>of reference because that's not a good way to act in the world.</v>

734
00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:49.010
<v Speaker 2>And then we tell stories to each other all the time trying to figure out what</v>

735
00:30:49.011 --> 00:30:50.900
<v Speaker 2>frames of reference we should adopted,</v>

736
00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:52.860
<v Speaker 2>which ones we should move away from it.</v>

737
00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:54.750
<v Speaker 2>That's how we advance for roads.</v>

738
00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:55.191
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>

739
00:30:55.191 --> 00:30:56.390
<v Speaker 2>very sophisticated.</v>

740
00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:57.741
<v Speaker 2>So okay,</v>

741
00:30:57.741 --> 00:30:58.574
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

742
00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:03.990
<v Speaker 1>back to back to how you frame the world.</v>

743
00:31:04.570 --> 00:31:05.330
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

744
00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:09.800
<v Speaker 2>let's say this will tell you about your emotions because it's good to know about</v>

745
00:31:09.801 --> 00:31:11.150
<v Speaker 2>your emotional to what they are.</v>

746
00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:14.660
<v Speaker 2>So let's say I'm over here and I want to walk.</v>

747
00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:16.580
<v Speaker 2>I decided that I would rather be.</v>

748
00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:18.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm like the chicken who's going to cross the road.</v>

749
00:31:18.861 --> 00:31:21.740
<v Speaker 2>I decided that it's better on the other side of the road because that's why the</v>

750
00:31:21.741 --> 00:31:25.580
<v Speaker 2>chicken crossed the road in case you in case you're wondering because everyone</v>

751
00:31:25.581 --> 00:31:26.201
<v Speaker 2>wonders that,</v>

752
00:31:26.201 --> 00:31:26.390
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

753
00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:27.890
<v Speaker 2>Why did the chicken cross the road?</v>

754
00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:31.000
<v Speaker 2>Because the chicken thinks it's better on the other side of the road because</v>

755
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:33.210
<v Speaker 2>otherwise why would he want other options?</v>

756
00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:36.320
<v Speaker 2>It's a grass is greener on the other side of the fence,</v>

757
00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:37.780
<v Speaker 2>so it's a stupid window.</v>

758
00:31:37.781 --> 00:31:38.890
<v Speaker 2>So you just stopped telling you.</v>

759
00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:48.270
<v Speaker 2>So let's say I decide I'm going to walk to the other side of the stage,</v>

760
00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:53.720
<v Speaker 2>so now this reality has transformed itself into a stage for me to undertake that</v>

761
00:31:55.771 --> 00:31:59.010
<v Speaker 2>action and so now I'm looking at your all blurring.</v>

762
00:31:59.040 --> 00:31:59.581
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

763
00:31:59.581 --> 00:32:01.170
<v Speaker 2>like black and white simpsons characters.</v>

764
00:32:01.171 --> 00:32:01.801
<v Speaker 2>I know you're there,</v>

765
00:32:01.801 --> 00:32:03.210
<v Speaker 2>but I can ignore you because.</v>

766
00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:06.390
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of you comes up and gets in my way.</v>

767
00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:10.590
<v Speaker 2>Then I don't have to pay attention to the fact that you exist in order to do the</v>

768
00:32:10.591 --> 00:32:14.790
<v Speaker 2>thing I'm going to do next and so I don't and I literally don't see you.</v>

769
00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:16.860
<v Speaker 2>You're going just like the people outside.</v>

770
00:32:16.861 --> 00:32:18.120
<v Speaker 2>The people out there in the city,</v>

771
00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:18.811
<v Speaker 2>they exist,</v>

772
00:32:18.811 --> 00:32:21.450
<v Speaker 2>but I can't see them because they're not hearing the way.</v>

773
00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:26.820
<v Speaker 2>And so then I look across here and I think I evaluate the landscape and I mean</v>

774
00:32:26.961 --> 00:32:30.540
<v Speaker 2>that technically as soon as I make a goal,</v>

775
00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:33.720
<v Speaker 2>the landscape changes into a place of value.</v>

776
00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:34.740
<v Speaker 2>And so.</v>

777
00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:35.910
<v Speaker 2>And what are the values?</v>

778
00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:36.330
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

779
00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:40.160
<v Speaker 2>the values first of all are what's your relevance</v>

780
00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:42.693
<v Speaker 3>in</v>

781
00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:45.353
<v Speaker 3>the world?</v>

782
00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:48.100
<v Speaker 3>It's unbelievable.</v>

783
00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:55.223
<v Speaker 3>It's just</v>

784
00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:58.100
<v Speaker 3>not the most important thing.</v>

785
00:32:58.101 --> 00:33:01.760
<v Speaker 3>I should act like it's just too complicated.</v>

786
00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:04.400
<v Speaker 3>So that's mostly what you do.</v>

787
00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:07.540
<v Speaker 3>You just ignore every.</v>

788
00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:12.760
<v Speaker 3>You just ignore absolutely everything except this tiny fraction of the world</v>

789
00:33:12.891 --> 00:33:17.000
<v Speaker 3>that you need to pay attention to in order to get to where you're going.</v>

790
00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:18.140
<v Speaker 3>And so that's another thing.</v>

791
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:19.640
<v Speaker 3>You don't really see</v>

792
00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:23.063
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

793
00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:26.540
<v Speaker 3>but not really.</v>

794
00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:31.250
<v Speaker 3>What you see when you look at the world is a map of how to get from place a to</v>

795
00:33:31.251 --> 00:33:35.680
<v Speaker 3>place b and place b is better than placing because point eight,</v>

796
00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:38.150
<v Speaker 3>let's say point B is better than a because,</v>

797
00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:38.740
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

798
00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:40.500
<v Speaker 3>while it isn't why we wouldn't get it.</v>

799
00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:43.760
<v Speaker 3>So not only do you see the point,</v>

800
00:33:43.761 --> 00:33:45.230
<v Speaker 3>you're going to point b,</v>

801
00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:49.040
<v Speaker 3>you contrast that with point a and you make the presupposition that what you're</v>

802
00:33:49.041 --> 00:33:50.500
<v Speaker 3>aiming at is better than what we have.</v>

803
00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:50.941
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

804
00:33:50.941 --> 00:33:53.570
<v Speaker 3>that's actually the definition of better in some sense,</v>

805
00:33:53.571 --> 00:33:54.210
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

806
00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:56.720
<v Speaker 3>Better is what you're aiming at because while,</v>

807
00:33:56.721 --> 00:33:58.670
<v Speaker 3>unless there's something gone seriously wrong,</v>

808
00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:01.610
<v Speaker 3>sometimes that happens,</v>

809
00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:05.270
<v Speaker 3>but we're not going to talk about that under normal circumstances.</v>

810
00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:10.360
<v Speaker 3>The mere fact that you're intending to do something means that you value and so</v>

811
00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:13.100
<v Speaker 3>it's a definition of value.</v>

812
00:34:13.101 --> 00:34:14.000
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>

813
00:34:14.001 --> 00:34:19.001
<v Speaker 3>I'm deciding that I want to get to the other side of the steak and so now I look</v>

814
00:34:19.431 --> 00:34:24.431
<v Speaker 3>at the stage and this is all irrelevant and this is all irrelevant and the floor</v>

815
00:34:24.921 --> 00:34:25.990
<v Speaker 3>is Kinda gray enough,</v>

816
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:26.870
<v Speaker 3>doesn't matter.</v>

817
00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:29.420
<v Speaker 3>It could be replaced with whatever color,</v>

818
00:34:29.450 --> 00:34:30.470
<v Speaker 3>whatever resolution.</v>

819
00:34:30.471 --> 00:34:32.180
<v Speaker 3>It's irrelevant as long as it doesn't move.</v>

820
00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:35.370
<v Speaker 3>And I'm really irritated by that little chair,</v>

821
00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:40.070
<v Speaker 3>a little stool in the middle because it's in my way and things are in your way.</v>

822
00:34:40.071 --> 00:34:42.440
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you feel negative emotion.</v>

823
00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:45.410
<v Speaker 3>So obstacles make you feel negative.</v>

824
00:34:45.411 --> 00:34:47.390
<v Speaker 3>Emotion and clear pathways.</v>

825
00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:51.260
<v Speaker 3>They make you feel positive emotions and that's part of the mapping function,</v>

826
00:34:51.261 --> 00:34:55.580
<v Speaker 3>so one of the things that I've become known for,</v>

827
00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:57.340
<v Speaker 3>let's say is this weird</v>

828
00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:01.600
<v Speaker 3>shape that you should clean your room,</v>

829
00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:05.660
<v Speaker 3>but you know it's not a cliche and here's why</v>

830
00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:09.520
<v Speaker 3>you think that your room is room,</v>

831
00:35:10.210 --> 00:35:14.840
<v Speaker 3>but it's not your room is there is the room,</v>

832
00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:19.180
<v Speaker 3>the independent material room and that and that's.</v>

833
00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:24.990
<v Speaker 3>That's not the relevant irrelevant room is the room that you inhabit.</v>

834
00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:28.880
<v Speaker 3>It's part of your conceptual system and your value system.</v>

835
00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:31.890
<v Speaker 3>If you spend two hours a day in a room,</v>

836
00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:34.310
<v Speaker 3>we'd give them room and that room isn't the room.</v>

837
00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:37.010
<v Speaker 3>That room is you for two hours a day.</v>

838
00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:39.960
<v Speaker 3>It's an extension of you.</v>

839
00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:42.660
<v Speaker 3>And if the room is health,</v>

840
00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:49.410
<v Speaker 3>well that's you.</v>

841
00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:51.300
<v Speaker 3>That's not helpful.</v>

842
00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:52.471
<v Speaker 3>So you think,</v>

843
00:35:52.471 --> 00:35:53.130
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

844
00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:54.850
<v Speaker 3>you have a room that's maybe not a good thing.</v>

845
00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:55.081
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

846
00:35:55.081 --> 00:35:56.070
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's not very fancy,</v>

847
00:35:56.071 --> 00:36:00.420
<v Speaker 3>but there it is right in front of you and you can sort it out and set it up.</v>

848
00:36:00.421 --> 00:36:01.254
<v Speaker 3>You can.</v>

849
00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:05.550
<v Speaker 3>You can make it function as part of what you value,</v>

850
00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:07.780
<v Speaker 3>which is what it means to clean it up.</v>

851
00:36:07.781 --> 00:36:08.400
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

852
00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.780
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing in that room?</v>

853
00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:11.640
<v Speaker 3>It's a place to wake up.</v>

854
00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:13.530
<v Speaker 3>It's a place to go to sleep.</v>

855
00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:15.510
<v Speaker 3>It's a place to get ready for the day.</v>

856
00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:17.400
<v Speaker 3>What are you going to do during the day?</v>

857
00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:21.140
<v Speaker 3>We're going to get dressed or what are you going to wear and why are you going</v>

858
00:36:21.141 --> 00:36:23.580
<v Speaker 3>to wear and how are you going to take care of it?</v>

859
00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:25.230
<v Speaker 3>And it's a costume for you,</v>

860
00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:30.090
<v Speaker 3>a dramatic costume to go out into the world in and to manifest your role.</v>

861
00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:34.620
<v Speaker 3>You want to get up and have to sort through of horrible heat of disorder before</v>

862
00:36:34.621 --> 00:36:37.830
<v Speaker 3>you can do whatever use was thing you're planning to inflict on the world.</v>

863
00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:41.100
<v Speaker 3>That's a hell of a way to start your day.</v>

864
00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:43.510
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's not obvious that you're ab up.</v>

865
00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:45.330
<v Speaker 3>It's not right that you stop that.</v>

866
00:36:45.331 --> 00:36:48.960
<v Speaker 3>You've got your rope construed property and just like what sort of person do you</v>

867
00:36:48.961 --> 00:36:51.160
<v Speaker 3>want to be exactly on.</v>

868
00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:56.410
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you set the room up as the stage on which the person that you want to be</v>

869
00:36:56.701 --> 00:36:58.140
<v Speaker 3>can enter the world.</v>

870
00:36:58.200 --> 00:36:58.621
<v Speaker 3>That isn't.</v>

871
00:36:58.621 --> 00:36:59.580
<v Speaker 3>If you do,</v>

872
00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:01.620
<v Speaker 3>if you have any sense,</v>

873
00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:03.500
<v Speaker 3>and so to clean up your room is,</v>

874
00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:04.640
<v Speaker 3>is all that,</v>

875
00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:08.610
<v Speaker 3>it's to set the stage for the person that you want to be,</v>

876
00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:13.200
<v Speaker 3>is to set the stage for the value structure that you're going to bring him to me</v>

877
00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:18.210
<v Speaker 3>and it's going to how the world manifests itself to you.</v>

878
00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:20.370
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing.</v>

879
00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:25.320
<v Speaker 3>Your values structure determines how the world manifests itself to you and</v>

880
00:37:25.321 --> 00:37:27.330
<v Speaker 3>that's actually the case.</v>

881
00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:29.460
<v Speaker 3>It's not just metaphorical.</v>

882
00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:32.070
<v Speaker 3>Now you know there's limits to that.</v>

883
00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:33.300
<v Speaker 3>You can fail.</v>

884
00:37:33.301 --> 00:37:36.530
<v Speaker 3>You going across the street and step up carelessly.</v>

885
00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:41.000
<v Speaker 3>You can get wiped out by a semi trailer and you know there's a certain arbitrary</v>

886
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:44.940
<v Speaker 3>this to the world and the mere fact that you're laying a value structure on it</v>

887
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.300
<v Speaker 3>doesn't transform its nature entirely,</v>

888
00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:50.970
<v Speaker 3>but it transformative nature a lot,</v>

889
00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:52.410
<v Speaker 3>a lot more than you think.</v>

890
00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:53.131
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>

891
00:37:53.131 --> 00:37:58.131
<v Speaker 3>we go back to my desire to walk across the stake and so I'm not happy that that</v>

892
00:37:58.951 --> 00:38:00.390
<v Speaker 3>obstacle is in my way.</v>

893
00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:04.190
<v Speaker 3>And so you can imagine that this might be my bedroom and it's just littered with</v>

894
00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:05.370
<v Speaker 3>mes.</v>

895
00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:06.720
<v Speaker 3>And so when I look at that,</v>

896
00:38:06.721 --> 00:38:11.721
<v Speaker 3>all I see is a maze of confusion impeding me in the smallest of tasks and that</v>

897
00:38:14.671 --> 00:38:16.260
<v Speaker 3>will make my heart sink,</v>

898
00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:21.360
<v Speaker 3>will make me anxious and disgusted and angry and unmotivated,</v>

899
00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:26.520
<v Speaker 3>especially if it's something that I've created around myself.</v>

900
00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:31.410
<v Speaker 3>It's not helpful so that even the smallest steps that I want to take forward are</v>

901
00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:34.470
<v Speaker 3>complicated by unnecessary obstacles.</v>

902
00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:35.520
<v Speaker 3>You've got to asked her.</v>

903
00:38:35.521 --> 00:38:36.990
<v Speaker 3>So I had a client once,</v>

904
00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:38.230
<v Speaker 3>so interesting.</v>

905
00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:39.700
<v Speaker 3>He had this dream,</v>

906
00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:41.320
<v Speaker 3>he had a new chart.</v>

907
00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:46.360
<v Speaker 3>He was 30 something he'd never grown up and he knew and he had this child and he</v>

908
00:38:46.751 --> 00:38:47.051
<v Speaker 3>thought,</v>

909
00:38:47.051 --> 00:38:47.321
<v Speaker 3>Jeez,</v>

910
00:38:47.321 --> 00:38:48.880
<v Speaker 3>I better get my act together because,</v>

911
00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:49.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

912
00:38:49.810 --> 00:38:50.830
<v Speaker 3>before it was just me.</v>

913
00:38:50.831 --> 00:38:54.790
<v Speaker 3>But now I've got this baby and probably I shouldn't be an immature more on</v>

914
00:38:54.791 --> 00:38:58.750
<v Speaker 3>anymore because we're probably going to be good for the baby.</v>

915
00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:02.950
<v Speaker 3>And so then he had this dream that I lightening bolt came into his bedroom,</v>

916
00:39:02.951 --> 00:39:04.060
<v Speaker 3>his bedroom,</v>

917
00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:05.440
<v Speaker 3>all lightning.</v>

918
00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:06.290
<v Speaker 3>It was bombed.</v>

919
00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:09.340
<v Speaker 3>And so he told me the dream and I said,</v>

920
00:39:09.341 --> 00:39:09.970
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

921
00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:10.181
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

922
00:39:10.181 --> 00:39:13.450
<v Speaker 3>you just had this baby and the baby is a potential,</v>

923
00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:17.500
<v Speaker 3>is absolutely potential for,</v>

924
00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:17.890
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

925
00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:19.480
<v Speaker 3>for good and for evil,</v>

926
00:39:19.481 --> 00:39:21.730
<v Speaker 3>for the whole span of human ability.</v>

927
00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:23.860
<v Speaker 3>Now you have this responsibility.</v>

928
00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:25.120
<v Speaker 3>That's what the dream is showing.</v>

929
00:39:25.121 --> 00:39:30.121
<v Speaker 3>This is incredibly charged things enter your life and it can bounce around and</v>

930
00:39:30.371 --> 00:39:31.450
<v Speaker 3>do all sorts of damage.</v>

931
00:39:31.451 --> 00:39:34.930
<v Speaker 3>You better straighten yourself up so that you can have them as property.</v>

932
00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:39.960
<v Speaker 3>So we decided that he would start by cleaning his room was a mess.</v>

933
00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:41.161
<v Speaker 3>Complete mess.</v>

934
00:39:41.161 --> 00:39:43.680
<v Speaker 3>It's like he's 30 something and getting it clean his room.</v>

935
00:39:43.681 --> 00:39:44.060
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

936
00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:46.150
<v Speaker 3>how pathetic is that?</v>

937
00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:46.901
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>

938
00:39:46.901 --> 00:39:47.530
<v Speaker 3>Inability.</v>

939
00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:48.850
<v Speaker 3>You don't know how to do it.</v>

940
00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:49.450
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

941
00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:50.500
<v Speaker 3>that's pathetic.</v>

942
00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:51.760
<v Speaker 3>And if it isn't inability,</v>

943
00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:52.121
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

944
00:39:52.121 --> 00:39:53.580
<v Speaker 3>well you not willing to.</v>

945
00:39:55.090 --> 00:39:56.290
<v Speaker 3>Well that's pathetic too.</v>

946
00:39:56.590 --> 00:39:58.030
<v Speaker 3>So either way it's pathetic.</v>

947
00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:02.620
<v Speaker 3>Or maybe you're too bitter about the structure.</v>

948
00:40:02.621 --> 00:40:03.940
<v Speaker 3>Braille and clean your room.</v>

949
00:40:03.941 --> 00:40:04.960
<v Speaker 3>And that's like your,</v>

950
00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:09.310
<v Speaker 3>your protest all show God and reality.</v>

951
00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:13.090
<v Speaker 3>What I think I'll just leave this room a maintenance room,</v>

952
00:40:13.091 --> 00:40:13.990
<v Speaker 3>a catastrophe,</v>

953
00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:17.250
<v Speaker 3>be my protests.</v>

954
00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:19.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

955
00:40:19.570 --> 00:40:20.920
<v Speaker 3>Do People Laugh about that?</v>

956
00:40:20.921 --> 00:40:21.450
<v Speaker 3>But that's the,</v>

957
00:40:21.450 --> 00:40:25.900
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the truth than in just not knowing how to do it or being lazy or</v>

958
00:40:25.901 --> 00:40:30.010
<v Speaker 3>any of that as a form of vengeance to form a vengeance against reality.</v>

959
00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:31.330
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

960
00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:36.640
<v Speaker 3>so we made a plan to clean his room and one of the things he thought he would do</v>

961
00:40:36.641 --> 00:40:37.630
<v Speaker 3>is vacuum,</v>

962
00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:41.770
<v Speaker 3>which wasn't a genius level hypothesis.</v>

963
00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:48.730
<v Speaker 3>And so he came back a week later,</v>

964
00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:49.823
<v Speaker 3>you said,</v>

965
00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:51.970
<v Speaker 3>I tried to get back to my room,</v>

966
00:40:51.971 --> 00:40:52.271
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

967
00:40:52.271 --> 00:40:52.811
<v Speaker 3>what happened?</v>

968
00:40:52.811 --> 00:40:53.081
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

969
00:40:53.081 --> 00:40:56.590
<v Speaker 3>I put the vacuum in the doorway of my bedroom.</v>

970
00:40:57.130 --> 00:40:58.100
<v Speaker 3>So matching.</v>

971
00:40:58.101 --> 00:40:59.620
<v Speaker 3>It was one of those push back humans,</v>

972
00:40:59.621 --> 00:41:00.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

973
00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:04.270
<v Speaker 3>so the head of it was laying against one side of the door Jamb and then the</v>

974
00:41:04.271 --> 00:41:06.400
<v Speaker 3>handwritten was leaning against the other men.</v>

975
00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:11.410
<v Speaker 3>He said for a whole week I walked over that vacuum to get into my room and I</v>

976
00:41:13.301 --> 00:41:13.930
<v Speaker 3>thought,</v>

977
00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:15.820
<v Speaker 3>that's a microcosm of your life.</v>

978
00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:18.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm dead serious about that.</v>

979
00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:20.230
<v Speaker 3>You can interpret that just like a dream.</v>

980
00:41:20.290 --> 00:41:22.300
<v Speaker 3>It was absolutely a microcosm with his life.</v>

981
00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:23.493
<v Speaker 3>Was like,</v>

982
00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:23.741
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

983
00:41:23.741 --> 00:41:25.420
<v Speaker 3>why can't I get anywhere?</v>

984
00:41:25.830 --> 00:41:25.960
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

985
00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:28.970
<v Speaker 3>there's these damn they're obstacles everywhere.</v>

986
00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:31.690
<v Speaker 3>The look was a vacuum cleaner right in my door.</v>

987
00:41:31.691 --> 00:41:32.710
<v Speaker 3>How can I do anything?</v>

988
00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:34.340
<v Speaker 3>You're in my door.</v>

989
00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:35.933
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

990
00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:37.093
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

991
00:41:37.310 --> 00:41:38.220
<v Speaker 3>you put it there.</v>

992
00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:41.690
<v Speaker 3>It sounded like he didn't notice.</v>

993
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:42.890
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't stupid.</v>

994
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:46.370
<v Speaker 3>He noticed he did it and we have a discussion about that.</v>

995
00:41:46.371 --> 00:41:46.700
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

996
00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:47.533
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

997
00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:48.950
<v Speaker 3>why is your life so difficult?</v>

998
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:51.860
<v Speaker 3>Because he put up obstacles in your path.</v>

999
00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:54.060
<v Speaker 3>All you just do not,</v>

1000
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:57.180
<v Speaker 3>but you could just walk there and no.</v>

1001
00:41:57.470 --> 00:41:59.090
<v Speaker 3>Put it back in cleaner in front and then you think,</v>

1002
00:41:59.091 --> 00:41:59.631
<v Speaker 3>Oh God,</v>

1003
00:41:59.631 --> 00:42:00.500
<v Speaker 3>that's so much trouble.</v>

1004
00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:01.393
<v Speaker 3>Just go like,</v>

1005
00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:02.393
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1006
00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:03.773
<v Speaker 1>What do I do?</v>

1007
00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:06.250
<v Speaker 1>I do play a video game.</v>

1008
00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:12.570
<v Speaker 3>I won't go to where I'm going because of all these damn dogs.</v>

1009
00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:17.310
<v Speaker 3>So what are the things you might ask yourself like you had to ask himself is how</v>

1010
00:42:17.311 --> 00:42:19.890
<v Speaker 3>many of the obstacles that get in your way that make you bitter?</v>

1011
00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:22.140
<v Speaker 3>It makes your world.</v>

1012
00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:28.530
<v Speaker 3>God only knows the answer to that and maybe here's something else that's even a</v>

1013
00:42:28.531 --> 00:42:33.060
<v Speaker 3>deeper question is maybe you put those obstacles there on purpose just so that</v>

1014
00:42:33.061 --> 00:42:35.340
<v Speaker 3>you have a reason so that you can be useless,</v>

1015
00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:37.110
<v Speaker 3>which is exactly what he was doing.</v>

1016
00:42:37.111 --> 00:42:38.030
<v Speaker 3>And he knew that he,</v>

1017
00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:39.840
<v Speaker 3>he came in and told me that he did,</v>

1018
00:42:39.841 --> 00:42:40.290
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1019
00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:41.290
<v Speaker 3>He was kind of laughing.</v>

1020
00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:46.350
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't that funny because he did it actually unbelievably screamingly</v>

1021
00:42:46.351 --> 00:42:49.650
<v Speaker 3>hilarious to tell you the truth was so absurd,</v>

1022
00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:50.210
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1023
00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:54.300
<v Speaker 3>but there was a terrible tragic element to the tube because he basically just</v>

1024
00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:57.990
<v Speaker 3>revealed to me and himself the whole essence of his life.</v>

1025
00:42:58.410 --> 00:42:59.243
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1026
00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:02.480
<v Speaker 3>so back to this,</v>

1027
00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:04.490
<v Speaker 3>back to the stool here.</v>

1028
00:43:04.491 --> 00:43:04.791
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1029
00:43:04.791 --> 00:43:05.830
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

1030
00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:10.010
<v Speaker 3>one of the things I can do to decrease the negative consequences of having that</v>

1031
00:43:10.011 --> 00:43:12.320
<v Speaker 3>stool in front of me is just go like this.</v>

1032
00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:13.191
<v Speaker 3>That'd be nice.</v>

1033
00:43:13.191 --> 00:43:15.610
<v Speaker 3>I could just circumvent the obstacle attire.</v>

1034
00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:16.513
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>

1035
00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:21.680
<v Speaker 3>if I lay out this landscape so that there are clear pathways to my goals and</v>

1036
00:43:21.681 --> 00:43:23.570
<v Speaker 3>when I looked at them landscape,</v>

1037
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:24.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm happy.</v>

1038
00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:29.210
<v Speaker 3>And the reason I'm happy is because this is the definition of happy.</v>

1039
00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:32.330
<v Speaker 3>So here's how it is that you're happy when you are,</v>

1040
00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:35.360
<v Speaker 1>you have a goal,</v>

1041
00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:38.570
<v Speaker 1>it's a good goal</v>

1042
00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:41.720
<v Speaker 3>and things are set up so that you can move towards it.</v>

1043
00:43:42.590 --> 00:43:43.520
<v Speaker 3>And so then you think,</v>

1044
00:43:43.521 --> 00:43:45.290
<v Speaker 3>well that's very interesting because,</v>

1045
00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:45.891
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1046
00:43:45.891 --> 00:43:46.560
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

1047
00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:49.550
<v Speaker 3>need goal two means you need a value structure.</v>

1048
00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:54.350
<v Speaker 3>And second it means that maybe there's a hierarchy of goals,</v>

1049
00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:54.711
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1050
00:43:54.711 --> 00:43:58.430
<v Speaker 3>Because some goals might be like the chickens goal just to get across the road,</v>

1051
00:43:58.431 --> 00:44:00.380
<v Speaker 3>but maybe there are higher order goals.</v>

1052
00:44:00.381 --> 00:44:00.831
<v Speaker 3>You might say,</v>

1053
00:44:00.831 --> 00:44:01.550
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1054
00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:06.170
<v Speaker 3>if you need a goal to orient yourself properly in the world,</v>

1055
00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:10.060
<v Speaker 3>what's the basketball to aim at?</v>

1056
00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:12.520
<v Speaker 3>Because if you're going to orient yourself to the world,</v>

1057
00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:16.750
<v Speaker 3>you've got a problem with having a goal and maybe you should have a basketball</v>

1058
00:44:16.810 --> 00:44:18.130
<v Speaker 3>because why not?</v>

1059
00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:18.460
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1060
00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:23.260
<v Speaker 3>Why settle for something second rate and so and then the next thing is once</v>

1061
00:44:23.261 --> 00:44:24.640
<v Speaker 3>you've established the goal,</v>

1062
00:44:24.641 --> 00:44:26.140
<v Speaker 3>the goal that is good,</v>

1063
00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:31.200
<v Speaker 3>then why not clean up the pathways to it so that you have the road in front of</v>

1064
00:44:32.311 --> 00:44:37.311
<v Speaker 3>you so that you can walk towards your noble goal and then maybe maybe not</v>

1065
00:44:39.091 --> 00:44:42.610
<v Speaker 3>allowed some positive meaning to your life and there's no maybe about it.</v>

1066
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:44.220
<v Speaker 3>That is exactly how it works.</v>

1067
00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:48.300
<v Speaker 3>And so one of the things you might ask yourself is it really there isn't any</v>

1068
00:44:48.301 --> 00:44:49.650
<v Speaker 3>positive meaning in your life.</v>

1069
00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:51.720
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you're aiming at the wrong thing.</v>

1070
00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:55.800
<v Speaker 3>And I tell you that you can think about that for about 15 years.</v>

1071
00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:59.180
<v Speaker 3>Like every day for eight hours you can take,</v>

1072
00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:00.990
<v Speaker 3>maybe I'm even at the wrong thing.</v>

1073
00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:04.740
<v Speaker 3>Maybe my life isn't playing itself out the way it should because I'm aiming at</v>

1074
00:45:04.741 --> 00:45:05.640
<v Speaker 3>the wrong thing.</v>

1075
00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:06.923
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1076
00:45:08.310 --> 00:45:09.840
<v Speaker 3>where's my error?</v>

1077
00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:11.420
<v Speaker 3>What should I be aiming at?</v>

1078
00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:11.920
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1079
00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:13.170
<v Speaker 3>these are very good questions.</v>

1080
00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:14.630
<v Speaker 3>Very good questions.</v>

1081
00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:14.950
<v Speaker 3>Indeed.</v>

1082
00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:16.290
<v Speaker 3>They're the ultimate questions.</v>

1083
00:45:16.291 --> 00:45:17.124
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1084
00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:18.310
<v Speaker 3>what should you be aiming at?</v>

1085
00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:23.920
<v Speaker 3>There's a scene in Pinocchio to the movie I quite like.</v>

1086
00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:26.453
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1087
00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:27.600
<v Speaker 3>so it's a,</v>

1088
00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:28.830
<v Speaker 3>it's a work of genius,</v>

1089
00:45:28.831 --> 00:45:29.664
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

1090
00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:30.310
<v Speaker 3>anatomy,</v>

1091
00:45:30.310 --> 00:45:31.160
<v Speaker 3>the work of Jesus.</v>

1092
00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:32.880
<v Speaker 3>It took people a long time to make that move.</v>

1093
00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:37.680
<v Speaker 3>They had to draw a lot of drugs and they were very high quality automators and</v>

1094
00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:38.461
<v Speaker 3>they have the sequence,</v>

1095
00:45:38.461 --> 00:45:41.940
<v Speaker 3>all those drawings and they had to come to a collective decision about what they</v>

1096
00:45:41.941 --> 00:45:44.460
<v Speaker 3>were going to draw and it had to decide to let the plot.</v>

1097
00:45:44.490 --> 00:45:46.530
<v Speaker 3>Every single bit of that movie,</v>

1098
00:45:46.590 --> 00:45:51.590
<v Speaker 3>every single tiny bit was the consequence of deep thought and collected and done</v>

1099
00:45:53.221 --> 00:45:55.230
<v Speaker 3>by a team of visionary genius.</v>

1100
00:45:55.390 --> 00:45:57.030
<v Speaker 3>And so it's worth thinking about,</v>

1101
00:45:57.090 --> 00:45:57.301
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1102
00:45:57.301 --> 00:45:59.100
<v Speaker 3>even though it's for kids,</v>

1103
00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:00.023
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

1104
00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:00.900
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1105
00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:03.380
<v Speaker 3>there's a great scene in there where Japan,</v>

1106
00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:03.550
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1107
00:46:03.550 --> 00:46:05.360
<v Speaker 3>makes Pinocchio would,</v>

1108
00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:08.220
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't edit puppet marionette.</v>

1109
00:46:08.221 --> 00:46:10.230
<v Speaker 3>So someone else's pulling his strings,</v>

1110
00:46:10.231 --> 00:46:10.441
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1111
00:46:10.441 --> 00:46:13.860
<v Speaker 3>Someone else is deciding what his values are going to be.</v>

1112
00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:15.120
<v Speaker 3>That's the Marionette.</v>

1113
00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:17.040
<v Speaker 3>He's not an autonomous being.</v>

1114
00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:21.870
<v Speaker 3>And Japan who's a great craftsmen and the positive father and someone who cares</v>

1115
00:46:21.871 --> 00:46:26.810
<v Speaker 3>for his child decides that it would be better if he was an antonymous and</v>

1116
00:46:26.811 --> 00:46:27.870
<v Speaker 3>complete being.</v>

1117
00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:29.040
<v Speaker 3>That's his wish.</v>

1118
00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:29.911
<v Speaker 3>That's a good wish.</v>

1119
00:46:29.911 --> 00:46:30.990
<v Speaker 3>If you're a father,</v>

1120
00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:32.570
<v Speaker 3>what the hell else are you going to wish for?</v>

1121
00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:34.790
<v Speaker 3>You want your son to remain a Marionette?</v>

1122
00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:38.670
<v Speaker 3>Is that the idea so that you can pull the strings are so that something else can</v>

1123
00:46:38.730 --> 00:46:42.180
<v Speaker 3>or do you want the strings to disappear and have the thing that's not fully</v>

1124
00:46:42.181 --> 00:46:46.140
<v Speaker 3>formed yet taken place in the world and Japan is a good,</v>

1125
00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:48.210
<v Speaker 3>is an archetype of the good father,</v>

1126
00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:48.940
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1127
00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:49.371
<v Speaker 3>as a,</v>

1128
00:46:49.371 --> 00:46:53.930
<v Speaker 3>as a craftsman and as a craftsman who cares about children and makes toys and</v>

1129
00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:59.030
<v Speaker 3>hasn't warmed Harlem as a safe place to be a place where kids can play and he</v>

1130
00:46:59.101 --> 00:47:02.040
<v Speaker 3>wants his child to expand completely into the world.</v>

1131
00:47:02.070 --> 00:47:03.310
<v Speaker 3>And so what he does is,</v>

1132
00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:05.040
<v Speaker 3>what does he do?</v>

1133
00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:07.080
<v Speaker 3>He wishes upon a star.</v>

1134
00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:08.041
<v Speaker 3>You think,</v>

1135
00:47:08.041 --> 00:47:08.580
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1136
00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:08.821
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1137
00:47:08.821 --> 00:47:09.481
<v Speaker 3>we do that.</v>

1138
00:47:09.481 --> 00:47:10.710
<v Speaker 3>Maybe do that with your kids.</v>

1139
00:47:10.711 --> 00:47:12.480
<v Speaker 3>You tell them that you could wish on a star,</v>

1140
00:47:12.490 --> 00:47:16.020
<v Speaker 3>you wish on a falling star and everyone kind of knows what that means,</v>

1141
00:47:16.021 --> 00:47:16.920
<v Speaker 3>but not really.</v>

1142
00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:17.820
<v Speaker 3>You think,</v>

1143
00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:17.911
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1144
00:47:17.911 --> 00:47:19.650
<v Speaker 3>what does it mean to wish on a star?</v>

1145
00:47:19.651 --> 00:47:20.011
<v Speaker 3>And you think,</v>

1146
00:47:20.011 --> 00:47:20.131
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1147
00:47:20.131 --> 00:47:21.150
<v Speaker 3>what's The star?</v>

1148
00:47:21.151 --> 00:47:21.984
<v Speaker 3>Exactly?</v>

1149
00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:25.350
<v Speaker 3>And I don't mean materialistically speaking,</v>

1150
00:47:25.351 --> 00:47:27.930
<v Speaker 3>I know it is damn this point.</v>

1151
00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:28.870
<v Speaker 3>There's the star.</v>

1152
00:47:28.871 --> 00:47:31.060
<v Speaker 3>That's the material launching and there's the star.</v>

1153
00:47:31.061 --> 00:47:32.650
<v Speaker 3>That's the element of perception.</v>

1154
00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:34.100
<v Speaker 3>The same thing,</v>

1155
00:47:34.101 --> 00:47:38.740
<v Speaker 3>even though they're related upon one another star as a Hollywood star,</v>

1156
00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:41.080
<v Speaker 3>why is a Hollywood star a star?</v>

1157
00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:44.170
<v Speaker 3>No one ever asks that really well.</v>

1158
00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:48.430
<v Speaker 3>Star is something that you look up to star as something to emulate.</v>

1159
00:47:48.431 --> 00:47:49.990
<v Speaker 3>That's Hollywood star.</v>

1160
00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:51.100
<v Speaker 3>That's why people.</v>

1161
00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:53.200
<v Speaker 3>That's why people are star struck.</v>

1162
00:47:54.130 --> 00:47:58.480
<v Speaker 3>It's because in these people who are stars play these larger than life rules on</v>

1163
00:47:58.481 --> 00:48:01.330
<v Speaker 3>the screen and those are ritual models for emulation.</v>

1164
00:48:01.331 --> 00:48:04.750
<v Speaker 3>So a scar is something that you look up to so that you can emulate it,</v>

1165
00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:09.160
<v Speaker 3>and Japan all looks up to the stars and that also means that he lifts his eyes</v>

1166
00:48:09.161 --> 00:48:11.530
<v Speaker 3>above the mundane landscape,</v>

1167
00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:11.891
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1168
00:48:11.891 --> 00:48:15.430
<v Speaker 3>He's not trying to get from this side of the stage to that side of the stage.</v>

1169
00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:16.001
<v Speaker 3>He's thinking,</v>

1170
00:48:16.001 --> 00:48:18.730
<v Speaker 3>what's the highest possible thing I could aim at?</v>

1171
00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:22.030
<v Speaker 3>An answer that is the light that glistens in the darkness.</v>

1172
00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:25.960
<v Speaker 3>I can lift my eyes up to that and I can orient myself towards that.</v>

1173
00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:28.060
<v Speaker 3>The highest possible good,</v>

1174
00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:29.860
<v Speaker 3>and that's the wish,</v>

1175
00:48:30.130 --> 00:48:32.440
<v Speaker 3>and here's the upshot of that.</v>

1176
00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:33.850
<v Speaker 3>If you aim,</v>

1177
00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:36.730
<v Speaker 3>that determines how you perceive the world,</v>

1178
00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:41.790
<v Speaker 3>then the highest possible aim that you can aim at lays out the best possible</v>

1179
00:48:42.041 --> 00:48:43.840
<v Speaker 3>world that you can live in,</v>

1180
00:48:44.290 --> 00:48:46.180
<v Speaker 3>and that's actually the truth.</v>

1181
00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:48.910
<v Speaker 3>It's the hard core,</v>

1182
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:54.000
<v Speaker 3>solid scientific truth that that's the case and so what happens with Japan knows</v>

1183
00:48:55.721 --> 00:49:00.490
<v Speaker 3>because he's a good man and he's put in the thousands of hours of discipline</v>

1184
00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:05.760
<v Speaker 3>necessary to be a careful disciplined crossman because he actually loves his son</v>

1185
00:49:06.161 --> 00:49:07.780
<v Speaker 3>and wants the best for him.</v>

1186
00:49:07.810 --> 00:49:12.810
<v Speaker 3>He looks up as high as he can possibly look and makes his wish and his wishes.</v>

1187
00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:14.980
<v Speaker 3>I wish that my son could be real.</v>

1188
00:49:15.070 --> 00:49:16.090
<v Speaker 3>It could be a real boy,</v>

1189
00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:22.600
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't headed puppet whose strings are being pulled by fate,</v>

1190
00:49:22.601 --> 00:49:24.890
<v Speaker 3>by forces behind the scenes,</v>

1191
00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:28.690
<v Speaker 3>and that's what that see me and it's absolutely.</v>

1192
00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:32.350
<v Speaker 3>It's absolutely brilliant and it catalyzes a kind of development,</v>

1193
00:49:32.351 --> 00:49:32.591
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1194
00:49:32.591 --> 00:49:37.591
<v Speaker 3>Because what happens is Japan makes his wish and then he falls asleep and then</v>

1195
00:49:37.601 --> 00:49:38.710
<v Speaker 3>the blue fairy shows up.</v>

1196
00:49:38.711 --> 00:49:40.120
<v Speaker 3>That's mother nature.</v>

1197
00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:43.940
<v Speaker 3>Mother Nature shows up and confers upon Japan.</v>

1198
00:49:43.950 --> 00:49:44.280
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1199
00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:45.070
<v Speaker 3>a gift,</v>

1200
00:49:45.070 --> 00:49:48.250
<v Speaker 3>and that's the gift of the beginning of autonomy and what that means is this,</v>

1201
00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:51.250
<v Speaker 3>if you're a good father and you have a son with you,</v>

1202
00:49:51.251 --> 00:49:54.880
<v Speaker 3>have a daughter for that matter and you wish above all that they will become</v>

1203
00:49:54.881 --> 00:49:55.400
<v Speaker 3>real.</v>

1204
00:49:55.400 --> 00:50:00.400
<v Speaker 3>The nature will step in and give them a hand and that's exactly how it works.</v>

1205
00:50:01.450 --> 00:50:01.631
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1206
00:50:01.631 --> 00:50:02.510
<v Speaker 3>and then the child,</v>

1207
00:50:02.830 --> 00:50:07.300
<v Speaker 3>the child himself or herself has to undertake their adventure in the world.</v>

1208
00:50:07.301 --> 00:50:08.920
<v Speaker 3>They have to make their own moral decisions.</v>

1209
00:50:08.921 --> 00:50:09.640
<v Speaker 3>You're not.</v>

1210
00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:11.230
<v Speaker 3>You're not the owner of your child,</v>

1211
00:50:11.231 --> 00:50:12.940
<v Speaker 3>even though you might be their guide,</v>

1212
00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:16.510
<v Speaker 3>you might be the person who sets up the structure within which they can flourish</v>

1213
00:50:16.511 --> 00:50:17.290
<v Speaker 3>or not.</v>

1214
00:50:17.290 --> 00:50:21.370
<v Speaker 3>The child has to play his or her role and that's also brilliantly detailed in</v>

1215
00:50:21.371 --> 00:50:25.170
<v Speaker 3>the movie to deal with temptation seemed to decide whether to tell the truth or</v>

1216
00:50:25.171 --> 00:50:29.840
<v Speaker 3>to lie and all and to decide to be neurotic and to be a victim because of course</v>

1217
00:50:29.841 --> 00:50:31.430
<v Speaker 3>that's part of the Pinocchio Story.</v>

1218
00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:32.600
<v Speaker 3>He's a tracker.</v>

1219
00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:37.930
<v Speaker 3>He's tempted by criminals into v into adopting the stance of a victim.</v>

1220
00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:38.861
<v Speaker 3>So that's.</v>

1221
00:50:38.861 --> 00:50:42.710
<v Speaker 3>That's something we can all meditate on for a certain amount of time,</v>

1222
00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:46.220
<v Speaker 3>so you want to aim as high as you possibly can,</v>

1223
00:50:46.370 --> 00:50:49.910
<v Speaker 3>and then the right thing to appear to you in the world as obstacles and the</v>

1224
00:50:49.911 --> 00:50:54.911
<v Speaker 3>right things appear to you in the world as pathways to move forward and those</v>

1225
00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:57.260
<v Speaker 3>pathways to move forward towards the highest goal.</v>

1226
00:50:57.260 --> 00:51:00.940
<v Speaker 3>Fill your soul with a kind of contentment that allows you to withstand the</v>

1227
00:51:00.941 --> 00:51:04.190
<v Speaker 3>suffering that characterized as being without becoming bitter.</v>

1228
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:05.690
<v Speaker 3>It's important.</v>

1229
00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:07.460
<v Speaker 3>It keeps you away from Hell.</v>

1230
00:51:07.610 --> 00:51:10.550
<v Speaker 3>It helps you orient yourself towards the highest possible</v>

1231
00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:15.350
<v Speaker 3>and then the world plays itself out in the proper manner.</v>

1232
00:51:15.610 --> 00:51:16.950
<v Speaker 3>Qualify suffering.</v>

1233
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.530
<v Speaker 3>Things aren't good for me.</v>

1234
00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:19.940
<v Speaker 3>If life is unbearable,</v>

1235
00:51:19.941 --> 00:51:23.810
<v Speaker 3>then maybe I'm not aiming in the right place and that's something that's</v>

1236
00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:27.500
<v Speaker 3>endlessly we're thinking about and I think that it's correct,</v>

1237
00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:29.150
<v Speaker 3>so then you might think,</v>

1238
00:51:29.151 --> 00:51:33.890
<v Speaker 3>well have accepted that as a potential reality.</v>

1239
00:51:34.370 --> 00:51:39.370
<v Speaker 3>How can you characterize what it is that you might a map and so</v>

1240
00:51:41.090 --> 00:51:45.430
<v Speaker 3>and this I think is the answer in some sense to this postmodern conundrum that</v>

1241
00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:47.270
<v Speaker 3>we've been faced with,</v>

1242
00:51:47.271 --> 00:51:52.250
<v Speaker 3>which is partly a puzzle that's emerged as we've figured out that the world is a</v>

1243
00:51:52.251 --> 00:51:54.080
<v Speaker 3>very difficult place to interpret.</v>

1244
00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:55.820
<v Speaker 3>The world is very complicated.</v>

1245
00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:57.950
<v Speaker 3>There are many maybe ways to interpret it.</v>

1246
00:51:58.070 --> 00:51:59.510
<v Speaker 3>How do you know which of those?</v>

1247
00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:01.910
<v Speaker 3>How can you rank order those weights?</v>

1248
00:52:03.050 --> 00:52:04.190
<v Speaker 3>The postmodern claim,</v>

1249
00:52:04.250 --> 00:52:06.610
<v Speaker 3>and this is what's being taught in the universities.</v>

1250
00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:11.420
<v Speaker 3>I would say the postmodern claim is there's no way of ranking rank ordering the</v>

1251
00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:13.820
<v Speaker 3>multitude of ways that you can interpret the world.</v>

1252
00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:19.220
<v Speaker 3>You can't make a final decision about route a or route b.</v>

1253
00:52:21.310 --> 00:52:26.310
<v Speaker 3>it's a chaotic tumbled of unconstrained possibility and it's demolished say</v>

1254
00:52:30.201 --> 00:52:34.760
<v Speaker 3>literary criticism because for a long time people would try to understand what</v>

1255
00:52:34.761 --> 00:52:37.970
<v Speaker 3>the book men but the postmodernist so well.</v>

1256
00:52:37.971 --> 00:52:41.060
<v Speaker 3>The book means an infinite number of things and there's no way that you can rank</v>

1257
00:52:41.061 --> 00:52:45.470
<v Speaker 3>order your interpretations because of that infinite complexity and there's a</v>

1258
00:52:45.471 --> 00:52:48.530
<v Speaker 3>manner in which that's true because the world is very complicated.</v>

1259
00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:50.570
<v Speaker 3>Any given text is complicated,</v>

1260
00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:54.710
<v Speaker 3>how many ways can you interpret the Bible and endless number of ways because</v>

1261
00:52:54.711 --> 00:52:56.120
<v Speaker 3>it's such a complicated text.</v>

1262
00:52:56.121 --> 00:52:57.890
<v Speaker 3>It's tied into everything.</v>

1263
00:52:58.010 --> 00:52:59.240
<v Speaker 3>Depends on where you look.</v>

1264
00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:04.070
<v Speaker 3>It depends on how you look because of course how things manifest themselves to</v>

1265
00:53:04.071 --> 00:53:04.161
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

1266
00:53:04.161 --> 00:53:09.161
<v Speaker 3>It depends on how you look and so it's a powerful critique except for one thing.</v>

1267
00:53:10.510 --> 00:53:13.370
<v Speaker 3>There is a very large number of ways looking at the world,</v>

1268
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:15.290
<v Speaker 3>but there aren't a very large number of ways,</v>

1269
00:53:15.590 --> 00:53:18.150
<v Speaker 3>a viable ways of looking at the world.</v>

1270
00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:19.640
<v Speaker 3>That's a whole different story.</v>

1271
00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:25.220
<v Speaker 3>You know that because if you look at the edge of a cliff,</v>

1272
00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:30.690
<v Speaker 3>like it's a solid place to walk and you act that out and you end up a crumpled</v>

1273
00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:35.780
<v Speaker 3>pile of bleeding bones at the bottom of the cliff and that seems to be evidence</v>

1274
00:53:36.571 --> 00:53:41.520
<v Speaker 3>that that particular interpretation of that particular phenomena wasn't in your</v>

1275
00:53:41.521 --> 00:53:42.900
<v Speaker 3>best interests.</v>

1276
00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:47.130
<v Speaker 3>And so there's a very limited number of ways of looking at the world that you</v>

1277
00:53:47.131 --> 00:53:49.110
<v Speaker 3>might say are in your best interest.</v>

1278
00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:53.340
<v Speaker 3>And so that takes that terrible complexity that the postmodernist some sort of</v>

1279
00:53:53.341 --> 00:53:54.151
<v Speaker 3>put in front of us.</v>

1280
00:53:54.151 --> 00:53:57.630
<v Speaker 3>And organizes it and you can think this through,</v>

1281
00:53:57.650 --> 00:54:00.570
<v Speaker 3>and this is part of the way that you think through what it is that you should.</v>

1282
00:54:00.580 --> 00:54:02.130
<v Speaker 3>Amen and so,</v>

1283
00:54:02.131 --> 00:54:05.790
<v Speaker 3>and this is the evolution of morality as far as I'm concerned and I think that's</v>

1284
00:54:05.791 --> 00:54:07.020
<v Speaker 3>the right way to think about it.</v>

1285
00:54:07.350 --> 00:54:10.650
<v Speaker 3>Think about it metaphysically or theologically or biblically,</v>

1286
00:54:10.651 --> 00:54:11.850
<v Speaker 3>ear or ethically,</v>

1287
00:54:11.851 --> 00:54:12.571
<v Speaker 3>all those ways,</v>

1288
00:54:12.571 --> 00:54:17.571
<v Speaker 3>but it's easier in some sense and it's easier and and more in keeping with the</v>

1289
00:54:18.211 --> 00:54:21.780
<v Speaker 3>full body of our knowledge to think about it as something that's emerged from</v>

1290
00:54:21.781 --> 00:54:22.650
<v Speaker 3>the bottom up.</v>

1291
00:54:22.890 --> 00:54:23.490
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1292
00:54:23.490 --> 00:54:24.930
<v Speaker 3>here's the constraints.</v>

1293
00:54:26.610 --> 00:54:30.270
<v Speaker 3>Why not just do what's impulsively pleasurable?</v>

1294
00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:33.450
<v Speaker 3>I talk about that in rule seven.</v>

1295
00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:35.130
<v Speaker 3>Do what is meaningful,</v>

1296
00:54:35.460 --> 00:54:36.870
<v Speaker 3>not once speed.</v>

1297
00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:39.780
<v Speaker 3>Speeding is momentary pleasure.</v>

1298
00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:42.240
<v Speaker 3>It's cocaine is expedient,</v>

1299
00:54:42.290 --> 00:54:42.990
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1300
00:54:42.990 --> 00:54:45.000
<v Speaker 3>Promiscuity is expedient.</v>

1301
00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:48.240
<v Speaker 3>Gluttony is expedient of violence,</v>

1302
00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:49.530
<v Speaker 3>can be expedient,</v>

1303
00:54:49.890 --> 00:54:51.630
<v Speaker 3>victory can be expedient,</v>

1304
00:54:51.810 --> 00:54:54.840
<v Speaker 3>and something that works now and you might think,</v>

1305
00:54:55.290 --> 00:54:55.441
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1306
00:54:55.441 --> 00:54:57.510
<v Speaker 3>why not just do what works now?</v>

1307
00:54:57.870 --> 00:54:59.220
<v Speaker 3>And that's who that is,</v>

1308
00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:02.310
<v Speaker 3>because you're not just here now.</v>

1309
00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:08.060
<v Speaker 3>You're here now and you're here now and you're here now and there.</v>

1310
00:55:08.071 --> 00:55:10.590
<v Speaker 3>You are repeating away during time.</v>

1311
00:55:10.860 --> 00:55:11.071
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1312
00:55:11.071 --> 00:55:12.960
<v Speaker 3>So there's the you that's sitting here now,</v>

1313
00:55:12.961 --> 00:55:15.870
<v Speaker 3>but there's the you that's gonna wake up tomorrow and there's the you that's</v>

1314
00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:20.640
<v Speaker 3>going to wake up in a month and in the year God willing five years in 10 years</v>

1315
00:55:20.641 --> 00:55:25.110
<v Speaker 3>and 20 years and so you can just take care of who you are now,</v>

1316
00:55:25.170 --> 00:55:29.610
<v Speaker 3>right this second in the most expedient possible way because the you that you're</v>

1317
00:55:29.611 --> 00:55:34.320
<v Speaker 3>going to me has to put up with the consequences of the you that you are now.</v>

1318
00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:37.620
<v Speaker 3>There's a funny scene in a simpsons cartoon.</v>

1319
00:55:37.710 --> 00:55:42.710
<v Speaker 3>So I think it's extraordinarily funny where homer is mixing up a quart of</v>

1320
00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:47.073
<v Speaker 3>oil</v>

1321
00:55:49.070 --> 00:55:50.730
<v Speaker 3>and a mark says,</v>

1322
00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:51.340
<v Speaker 3>well that's,</v>

1323
00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:52.140
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1324
00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:53.760
<v Speaker 3>you should think twice about doing that in.</v>

1325
00:55:53.761 --> 00:55:54.594
<v Speaker 3>Homer says,</v>

1326
00:55:54.690 --> 00:55:56.780
<v Speaker 3>well that's a problem for future homework.</v>

1327
00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:57.301
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>

1328
00:55:57.301 --> 00:55:58.680
<v Speaker 3>Glad I'm not that guy.</v>

1329
00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:02.311
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>

1330
00:56:02.311 --> 00:56:03.390
<v Speaker 3>I think that's very funny,</v>

1331
00:56:04.630 --> 00:56:05.660
<v Speaker 3>but that's exactly it.</v>

1332
00:56:05.890 --> 00:56:08.140
<v Speaker 3>Like you're all future homer's man.</v>

1333
00:56:08.190 --> 00:56:09.520
<v Speaker 3>And so</v>

1334
00:56:11.380 --> 00:56:15.120
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of impulsive expediency goes a very long way.</v>

1335
00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:19.700
<v Speaker 3>And so you have to think about your life as it iterating gay rights.</v>

1336
00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:21.450
<v Speaker 3>You have to play the game right now.</v>

1337
00:56:22.180 --> 00:56:23.560
<v Speaker 3>You have completed the right there.</v>

1338
00:56:23.590 --> 00:56:27.310
<v Speaker 3>On the way that doesn't compromise the way you play it tomorrow and it doesn't</v>

1339
00:56:27.311 --> 00:56:29.160
<v Speaker 3>compromise the way you play it next week,</v>

1340
00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:29.920
<v Speaker 3>next month,</v>

1341
00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:30.621
<v Speaker 3>next year,</v>

1342
00:56:30.621 --> 00:56:31.630
<v Speaker 3>and five years from now,</v>

1343
00:56:31.631 --> 00:56:32.464
<v Speaker 3>10 years from now,</v>

1344
00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:34.860
<v Speaker 3>and maybe the constraint is even more severe than that.</v>

1345
00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:38.310
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you want to play the game right now so that the game you played,</v>

1346
00:56:38.311 --> 00:56:42.220
<v Speaker 3>Mauro is slightly better in the game he played two years from now is even better</v>

1347
00:56:42.221 --> 00:56:42.701
<v Speaker 3>than that,</v>

1348
00:56:42.701 --> 00:56:46.210
<v Speaker 3>so you don't want to just play a game that you can repeat without.</v>

1349
00:56:46.690 --> 00:56:50.290
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to play a game that you can repeat at a plateau and you don't</v>

1350
00:56:50.291 --> 00:56:53.170
<v Speaker 3>want to play a game that you can repeat that deteriorates.</v>

1351
00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:54.730
<v Speaker 3>That's definitely a bad game.</v>

1352
00:56:54.820 --> 00:56:57.190
<v Speaker 3>Things are going from bad to worse.</v>

1353
00:56:57.250 --> 00:56:58.420
<v Speaker 3>Who wants to play that?</v>

1354
00:56:58.480 --> 00:56:58.601
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1355
00:56:58.601 --> 00:57:02.230
<v Speaker 3>maybe if you're a marketer you can do that and you'll meet people like that,</v>

1356
00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:05.800
<v Speaker 3>but maybe one play a game that was like this one that's oriented towards</v>

1357
00:57:05.801 --> 00:57:09.520
<v Speaker 3>whatever that star is and so that's a tight constraint man and everybody knows</v>

1358
00:57:09.521 --> 00:57:11.260
<v Speaker 3>that that's the straight and narrow.</v>

1359
00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:15.720
<v Speaker 3>That's a tough one and then it's worse than that because it isn't just used it</v>

1360
00:57:15.730 --> 00:57:18.850
<v Speaker 3>at stake here and the iterated future use.</v>

1361
00:57:18.940 --> 00:57:20.830
<v Speaker 3>You're also embedded in the world.</v>

1362
00:57:20.831 --> 00:57:21.500
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1363
00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:22.091
<v Speaker 3>well there's you,</v>

1364
00:57:22.091 --> 00:57:23.620
<v Speaker 3>but then there's the person you're with,</v>

1365
00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:24.670
<v Speaker 3>your intimate partner,</v>

1366
00:57:24.671 --> 00:57:25.560
<v Speaker 3>maybe your father,</v>

1367
00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:26.340
<v Speaker 3>your mother,</v>

1368
00:57:26.340 --> 00:57:31.000
<v Speaker 3>your siblings or your children and they're just as much you as you are.</v>

1369
00:57:31.001 --> 00:57:31.930
<v Speaker 3>Maybe even more.</v>

1370
00:57:31.931 --> 00:57:32.150
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1371
00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:34.000
<v Speaker 3>people will die for their children,</v>

1372
00:57:34.090 --> 00:57:37.380
<v Speaker 3>so maybe they're more of their children than they are themselves now.</v>

1373
00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:42.270
<v Speaker 3>You look at it so you have to propagate itself through time in a matter of</v>

1374
00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:43.900
<v Speaker 3>seconds,</v>

1375
00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:48.460
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time makes your children's life parents,</v>

1376
00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:49.840
<v Speaker 3>your siblings,</v>

1377
00:57:51.420 --> 00:57:52.253
<v Speaker 3>friends.</v>

1378
00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:53.710
<v Speaker 3>Same problem.</v>

1379
00:57:53.711 --> 00:57:57.970
<v Speaker 3>And then there's the broader community and so you actually have to organize all</v>

1380
00:57:57.971 --> 00:58:02.971
<v Speaker 3>your aims and stack them all up so that at the same time,</v>

1381
00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:08.470
<v Speaker 3>and there's not an infinite number of ways of doing that is a finite number of</v>

1382
00:58:08.471 --> 00:58:09.550
<v Speaker 3>ways of doing that.</v>

1383
00:58:09.610 --> 00:58:13.510
<v Speaker 3>And the final way is the way that you do things when you do them right.</v>

1384
00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:15.490
<v Speaker 3>And everyone knows that.</v>

1385
00:58:15.491 --> 00:58:20.080
<v Speaker 3>And that seems to be aligned with something like with something like telling the</v>

1386
00:58:20.081 --> 00:58:23.640
<v Speaker 3>truth or just rule eight in my book,</v>

1387
00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:24.431
<v Speaker 3>tell the truth,</v>

1388
00:58:24.431 --> 00:58:25.450
<v Speaker 3>or at least don't lie.</v>
