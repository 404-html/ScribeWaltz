00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.120
<v Speaker 1>There's an old psychoanalytic idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really worthwhile.</v>

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.880
<v Speaker 1>It's like a surgical tool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say if you're going to use</v>

3
00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:09.000
<v Speaker 1>it in your own life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use it carefully because you don't want</v>

4
00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:11.760
<v Speaker 1>to do unnecessary surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the rule is,</v>

5
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.120
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is union rule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't remember exactly where I</v>

6
00:00:15.121 --> 00:00:18.840
<v Speaker 1>read it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can't understand why someone is</v>

7
00:00:18.841 --> 00:00:22.650
<v Speaker 1>doing something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the consequences of their</v>

8
00:00:22.651 --> 00:00:25.200
<v Speaker 1>actions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever those might be.</v>

9
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.350
<v Speaker 1>And then in further motivation from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>

10
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.640
<v Speaker 1>So if you see someone who seems to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing nothing except making everyone</v>

11
00:00:32.641 --> 00:00:36.330
<v Speaker 1>around them and themselves miserable and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't understand why,</v>

12
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.230
<v Speaker 1>one of the hypotheses that you might</v>
<v Speaker 1>entertain is that they're trying to make</v>

13
00:00:40.231 --> 00:00:43.050
<v Speaker 1>everyone around the miserable as well as</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

14
00:00:43.051 --> 00:00:47.280
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually their goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's hard for people to understand</v>

15
00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:51.390
<v Speaker 1>these sorts of things because when we</v>
<v Speaker 1>see phenomena like the columbine</v>

16
00:00:51.391 --> 00:00:52.350
<v Speaker 1>shooters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.610
<v Speaker 1>we always assume that the reason that</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people are doing these sorts of</v>

18
00:00:56.611 --> 00:00:58.170
<v Speaker 1>things is for other reasons.</v>

19
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.860
<v Speaker 1>Then the reasons they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the reasons that appear to motivate</v>

20
00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:05.070
<v Speaker 1>them or even the reasons they say</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing it because the columbine</v>

21
00:01:05.071 --> 00:01:06.630
<v Speaker 1>killer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the more literate one,</v>

22
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.360
<v Speaker 1>he said exactly why he was doing what he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was doing.</v>

23
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.180
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's as clear as it could possibly be.</v>

24
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.990
<v Speaker 1>All you have to do is go online and read</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he said and he tells you what he</v>

25
00:01:15.991 --> 00:01:18.450
<v Speaker 1>was up to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But people don't like to think that way</v>

26
00:01:18.451 --> 00:01:22.530
<v Speaker 1>because they don't believe that anybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be consciously possessed of that</v>

27
00:01:22.531 --> 00:01:26.400
<v Speaker 1>much malevolence without there being</v>
<v Speaker 1>some other kind of cause.</v>

28
00:01:26.401 --> 00:01:27.300
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:27.301 --> 00:01:31.230
<v Speaker 1>he was bullied at school or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was an outcast and those things were</v>

30
00:01:31.231 --> 00:01:33.990
<v Speaker 1>only vaguely true and they certainly</v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't more true of having them.</v>

31
00:01:33.991 --> 00:01:35.610
<v Speaker 1>They were true of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.430
<v Speaker 1>how many people in high school or you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

33
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.770
<v Speaker 1>bullied and somewhat outkast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

34
00:01:40.771 --> 00:01:43.980
<v Speaker 1>it must be 10%.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably more like 30 you know,</v>

35
00:01:43.981 --> 00:01:46.440
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean that the schools are</v>
<v Speaker 1>blowing up all over,</v>

36
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all over all the time.</v>

37
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.640
<v Speaker 1>It's a completely insufficient</v>
<v Speaker 1>explanation.</v>
