1
00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:09.820
<v Speaker 1>So now there's this idea that there's a,</v>

2
00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.660
<v Speaker 1>there's the possibility of opening up a line of communication between human</v>

3
00:00:13.661 --> 00:00:15.610
<v Speaker 1>psyche and the transcendent divine.</v>

4
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:17.200
<v Speaker 1>And there's a,</v>

5
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.930
<v Speaker 1>there's a great image of Christ as Pantry.</v>

6
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.901
<v Speaker 1>They're so creative,</v>

7
00:00:20.901 --> 00:00:23.660
<v Speaker 1>the world at just one of the first mosaics,</v>

8
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:24.920
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly.</v>

9
00:00:24.921 --> 00:00:25.740
<v Speaker 1>And I wish I knew,</v>

10
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.750
<v Speaker 1>remember where it was,</v>

11
00:00:26.751 --> 00:00:27.500
<v Speaker 1>but I don't,</v>

12
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.751
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

13
00:00:27.751 --> 00:00:29.180
<v Speaker 1>it's a very interesting image.</v>

14
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm having a carving of it made at the moment by a friend of mine.</v>

15
00:00:32.331 --> 00:00:37.331
<v Speaker 1>But you see Christ's face in me portrayed in a medieval manner and he's holding</v>

16
00:00:39.141 --> 00:00:39.561
<v Speaker 1>a book.</v>

17
00:00:39.561 --> 00:00:42.290
<v Speaker 1>So it symbolizes the importance of,</v>

18
00:00:42.291 --> 00:00:42.981
<v Speaker 1>of the book,</v>

19
00:00:42.981 --> 00:00:43.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

20
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.620
<v Speaker 1>as a means of transmitting wisdom.</v>

22
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.060
<v Speaker 1>And his face is very asymmetrical and the eyes are different.</v>

23
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.110
<v Speaker 1>One side and the other,</v>

24
00:00:51.111 --> 00:00:54.290
<v Speaker 1>and one half of the face represents the human part.</v>

25
00:00:54.291 --> 00:00:57.290
<v Speaker 1>And the other side of the face represents the divine part.</v>

26
00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.250
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

27
00:00:58.251 --> 00:01:03.251
<v Speaker 1>I also think about that psychologically because I do think that that's the right</v>

28
00:01:03.921 --> 00:01:08.390
<v Speaker 1>way to conceptualize human beings is that there's an aspect of us that's mortal</v>

29
00:01:08.391 --> 00:01:09.620
<v Speaker 1>and cumin and limited,</v>

30
00:01:09.621 --> 00:01:12.830
<v Speaker 1>but there's an aspect of us that's transcendent and divine as well.</v>

31
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.540
<v Speaker 1>And it's latent in some sense.</v>

32
00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:17.030
<v Speaker 1>But there are times when it manifests itself.</v>

33
00:01:17.031 --> 00:01:19.280
<v Speaker 1>And this is not speculation,</v>

34
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.660
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

35
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.510
<v Speaker 1>This is like the oldest experience of human beings.</v>

36
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.900
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

37
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.600
<v Speaker 1>it's not necessarily an easy experience to have,</v>

38
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.550
<v Speaker 1>but it's reported everywhere.</v>

39
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.510
<v Speaker 1>And it can be reliably induced as we've discussed before by chemical means,</v>

40
00:01:32.511 --> 00:01:32.900
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

41
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.910
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know what that means exactly.</v>

42
00:01:34.911 --> 00:01:37.700
<v Speaker 1>We've talked a little bit about silicide mushrooms for example.</v>

43
00:01:37.701 --> 00:01:41.450
<v Speaker 1>And you could say that the mystical experiences that have been invoked in the</v>

44
00:01:41.451 --> 00:01:46.451
<v Speaker 1>newest experiments down it at Johns Hopkins are derangements or forms of</v>

45
00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:47.990
<v Speaker 1>psychosis,</v>

46
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.351
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

47
00:01:48.351 --> 00:01:52.490
<v Speaker 1>because they have some similarity to psycho psychotic experiences.</v>

48
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.470
<v Speaker 1>Although psychotic people were given LSD in the 60s and they always said that</v>

49
00:01:57.471 --> 00:01:59.540
<v Speaker 1>that was something different than what they were having.</v>

50
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.270
<v Speaker 1>And if you give psychotic people amphetamines,</v>

51
00:02:02.271 --> 00:02:03.350
<v Speaker 1>you can make them worse.</v>

52
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.000
<v Speaker 1>So there biochemically separate.</v>

53
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.200
<v Speaker 1>And we know that.</v>

54
00:02:06.201 --> 00:02:06.650
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

55
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.090
<v Speaker 1>but also the thing that's so interesting about the psilocybin experiences is</v>

56
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.510
<v Speaker 1>that they reliably produce mystical experiences that the people rate as among</v>

57
00:02:14.511 --> 00:02:16.430
<v Speaker 1>the most important experiences of their life.</v>

58
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.540
<v Speaker 1>And among those who have the psychedelic experience,</v>

59
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.910
<v Speaker 1>positive things happen to them.</v>

60
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.850
<v Speaker 1>And so that kind of messes with the whole psychosis theory,</v>

61
00:02:25.851 --> 00:02:26.091
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

62
00:02:26.091 --> 00:02:27.140
<v Speaker 1>Because what are you going to do?</v>

63
00:02:27.141 --> 00:02:30.230
<v Speaker 1>You're going to claim that you give someone a pill and they have a psychotic</v>

64
00:02:30.231 --> 00:02:31.430
<v Speaker 1>break and then they're healthier.</v>

65
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.971
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

66
00:02:31.971 --> 00:02:32.660
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

67
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.550
<v Speaker 1>that isn't how psychotic breaks work.</v>

68
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.500
<v Speaker 1>You're not healthier after having one.</v>

69
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:37.580
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

70
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.340
<v Speaker 1>you're a broken egg and it's not easy to put you back together.</v>

71
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:41.683
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

72
00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.290
<v Speaker 1>and we know that people all over the world have discovered every manner of</v>

73
00:02:45.291 --> 00:02:47.900
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic substance that you could possibly,</v>

74
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.020
<v Speaker 1>while you imagine there's lots of hungry people wandering the earth for a long</v>

75
00:02:51.021 --> 00:02:54.050
<v Speaker 1>time and they eat every damn thing they could get their hands on and now,</v>

76
00:02:54.051 --> 00:02:57.470
<v Speaker 1>and then something very peculiar happened as a consequence.</v>

77
00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.903
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

78
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.430
<v Speaker 1>so here I'm going to tell you a little bit about the Shamani tradition because</v>

79
00:03:06.431 --> 00:03:08.110
<v Speaker 1>it's associated with Jacob's ladder.</v>

80
00:03:08.111 --> 00:03:08.880
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

81
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:09.640
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

82
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.480
<v Speaker 1>according to Elliot at Mircea Eliade,</v>

83
00:03:11.481 --> 00:03:12.940
<v Speaker 1>who was a great historian of religion,</v>

84
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.930
<v Speaker 1>a compatriot of viewings and,</v>

85
00:03:14.931 --> 00:03:15.261
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

86
00:03:15.261 --> 00:03:17.710
<v Speaker 1>and the influenced each other quite substantially.</v>

87
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.870
<v Speaker 1>Eliana believed that shamanism that used psychedelics was a degeneration from</v>

88
00:03:22.871 --> 00:03:23.770
<v Speaker 1>the original,</v>

89
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.360
<v Speaker 1>more pure shamanism.</v>

90
00:03:25.361 --> 00:03:28.790
<v Speaker 1>But I think later scholarship has demonstrated that that's incorrect,</v>

91
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.350
<v Speaker 1>that the show ritual per se was a direct consequence of the use discovery of Ed</v>

92
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.870
<v Speaker 1>and ritualistic use of psychedelic substances.</v>

93
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:38.703
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

94
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.010
<v Speaker 1>Eliana identified three pathways to shamanism and the Sharman in it,</v>

95
00:03:44.701 --> 00:03:49.701
<v Speaker 1>in a tribe was more educated than the typical person with a larger vocabulary</v>

96
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.850
<v Speaker 1>and was the repository of the oral tradition.</v>

97
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.230
<v Speaker 1>And so learned all the stories that had been passed down.</v>

98
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:00.101
<v Speaker 1>Word of mouth.</v>

99
00:04:00.101 --> 00:04:01.210
<v Speaker 1>And people by the way,</v>

100
00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:01.571
<v Speaker 1>are very,</v>

101
00:04:01.571 --> 00:04:02.404
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

102
00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:03.251
<v Speaker 1>can very,</v>

103
00:04:03.251 --> 00:04:06.160
<v Speaker 1>very accurately tell the same story across generations.</v>

104
00:04:06.161 --> 00:04:07.780
<v Speaker 1>That's been quite well documented.</v>

105
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.860
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

106
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:09.130
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

107
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.690
<v Speaker 1>and people who can't read really can remember cause what else are they gonna do?</v>

108
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.890
<v Speaker 1>Their memories are far greater than modern people's memories because we can</v>

109
00:04:17.891 --> 00:04:19.630
<v Speaker 1>forget everything because we can just look it up.</v>

110
00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.900
<v Speaker 1>But they remembered things because they had no choice.</v>

111
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.500
<v Speaker 1>My father knew someone who was a illiterate and,</v>

112
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.030
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

113
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.370
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

114
00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.490
<v Speaker 1>and couldn't use numbers either when,</v>

115
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.180
<v Speaker 1>when he grew up in Saskatchewan,</v>

116
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:32.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

117
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:33.430
<v Speaker 1>60 years ago.</v>

118
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:34.661
<v Speaker 1>And he was,</v>

119
00:04:34.661 --> 00:04:35.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

120
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.011
<v Speaker 1>he had a sheep,</v>

121
00:04:36.011 --> 00:04:37.180
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly.</v>

122
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.620
<v Speaker 1>And although he couldn't count,</v>

123
00:04:38.621 --> 00:04:42.130
<v Speaker 1>he knew if one of his sheep was missing because he knew all the sheep.</v>

124
00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.550
<v Speaker 1>And so he could tell just by looking if one of the sheep was missing but he</v>

125
00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:46.384
<v Speaker 1>couldn't count.</v>

126
00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:47.523
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

127
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.251
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

128
00:04:48.251 --> 00:04:50.950
<v Speaker 1>so people who don't have our particular set of skills,</v>

129
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.461
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

130
00:04:51.461 --> 00:04:52.181
<v Speaker 1>they're not stupid.</v>

131
00:04:52.181 --> 00:04:52.691
<v Speaker 1>And second,</v>

132
00:04:52.691 --> 00:04:54.970
<v Speaker 1>they have other skills that we don't understand to,</v>

133
00:04:54.971 --> 00:04:55.990
<v Speaker 1>to fill in the gaps.</v>

134
00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.440
<v Speaker 1>So Eliana identified spontaneous vocation.</v>

135
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:00.850
<v Speaker 1>So you were just,</v>

136
00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.320
<v Speaker 1>you had this spirit of a Sharman,</v>

137
00:05:02.321 --> 00:05:02.681
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

138
00:05:02.681 --> 00:05:04.510
<v Speaker 1>So you're probably extremely high in openness,</v>

139
00:05:04.511 --> 00:05:06.040
<v Speaker 1>let's say from a modern perspective,</v>

140
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.690
<v Speaker 1>hereditary transmission.</v>

141
00:05:07.691 --> 00:05:08.830
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

142
00:05:08.831 --> 00:05:11.770
<v Speaker 1>your father was a showman and your grandfather was a showman and so forth,</v>

143
00:05:11.771 --> 00:05:15.520
<v Speaker 1>and you got initiated into that process or a personal quest</v>

144
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.610
<v Speaker 1>in Siberia.</v>

145
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.380
<v Speaker 1>This is from Eliana and Siberia.</v>

146
00:05:20.381 --> 00:05:24.370
<v Speaker 1>The youth who is called to be a showman attracts attention by his strange</v>

147
00:05:24.371 --> 00:05:25.204
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

148
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:26.081
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

149
00:05:26.081 --> 00:05:26.980
<v Speaker 1>he seeks solitude,</v>

150
00:05:26.981 --> 00:05:27.970
<v Speaker 1>becomes absent minded,</v>

151
00:05:27.971 --> 00:05:31.240
<v Speaker 1>loves to roam in the woods or unfrequently frequented places has visions and</v>

152
00:05:31.241 --> 00:05:32.110
<v Speaker 1>sings in his sleep.</v>

153
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

154
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.560
<v Speaker 1>if you put someone in a in a place that's deprived,</v>

155
00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:36.990
<v Speaker 1>that's where you're,</v>

156
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.853
<v Speaker 1>you're deprived.</v>

157
00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.460
<v Speaker 1>From a sensory perspective,</v>

158
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:40.690
<v Speaker 1>it fit normal.</v>

159
00:05:40.691 --> 00:05:42.310
<v Speaker 1>People will hallucinate quite quickly,</v>

160
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.300
<v Speaker 1>so it seems what happens is that if you dampen down the sensory input,</v>

161
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.630
<v Speaker 1>then you start to become aware of the background processes of your mind.</v>

162
00:05:49.631 --> 00:05:50.441
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

163
00:05:50.441 --> 00:05:52.270
<v Speaker 1>It's like the signal to noise ratio.</v>

164
00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:53.890
<v Speaker 1>I got to get this right.</v>

165
00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.250
<v Speaker 1>As the noise decreases,</v>

166
00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.600
<v Speaker 1>some of the noise becomes signal,</v>

167
00:05:59.601 --> 00:06:02.840
<v Speaker 1>the background noise becomes signal and you start to become aware of your own</v>

168
00:06:02.841 --> 00:06:04.430
<v Speaker 1>internal psychological processes.</v>

169
00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:05.330
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

170
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.790
<v Speaker 1>He has visions and sings in his sleep.</v>

171
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.050
<v Speaker 1>In some instances,</v>

172
00:06:09.051 --> 00:06:12.740
<v Speaker 1>this period of incubation is marked by quite serious symptoms among the Yakut.</v>

173
00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.400
<v Speaker 1>The young man sometimes has fits of fury and easily loses consciousness,</v>

174
00:06:16.401 --> 00:06:17.390
<v Speaker 1>hides in the forest,</v>

175
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.950
<v Speaker 1>feeds on the bark of trees,</v>

176
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.760
<v Speaker 1>throws himself into water and fire and cuts themselves with knives.</v>

177
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.180
<v Speaker 1>We went to a potlatch in northern northern Vancouver island.</v>

178
00:06:29.181 --> 00:06:31.640
<v Speaker 1>About a year ago and they had this one dance,</v>

179
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:36.020
<v Speaker 1>it was the Kwakwaka'wakw natives and they had this interesting dance that was</v>

180
00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:37.310
<v Speaker 1>the dance of the wild man.</v>

181
00:06:37.311 --> 00:06:42.311
<v Speaker 1>And so the person who invited us was the wild man and he was dressed up in tree</v>

182
00:06:42.591 --> 00:06:43.760
<v Speaker 1>branches and so forth.</v>

183
00:06:43.761 --> 00:06:47.960
<v Speaker 1>And so he was the person who'd been in the Bush too long and he came in as a</v>

184
00:06:47.961 --> 00:06:52.961
<v Speaker 1>cannibal and there there was genuine cannibalistic rites among these people not</v>

185
00:06:53.331 --> 00:06:54.141
<v Speaker 1>so long ago.</v>

186
00:06:54.141 --> 00:06:57.080
<v Speaker 1>And he came in as accountable and everybody had to wear this like cedar head</v>

187
00:06:57.081 --> 00:06:59.360
<v Speaker 1>dress because if you had a cedar headdress on,</v>

188
00:06:59.361 --> 00:07:01.370
<v Speaker 1>then the cannibal wouldn't take a bite out of you.</v>

189
00:07:01.371 --> 00:07:03.710
<v Speaker 1>And they actually took this route as seriously,</v>

190
00:07:03.711 --> 00:07:06.320
<v Speaker 1>so you should have your Cedar headdress on.</v>

191
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.620
<v Speaker 1>And so he's looking around the crowd and there's like 400 people in this place</v>

192
00:07:09.621 --> 00:07:11.420
<v Speaker 1>and he could really act too.</v>

193
00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:13.100
<v Speaker 1>So he's doing this wild man dance.</v>

194
00:07:13.101 --> 00:07:18.101
<v Speaker 1>And then all the women stood up and started to tight kind of dancing place and</v>

195
00:07:18.321 --> 00:07:20.480
<v Speaker 1>sing and they were taming him.</v>

196
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:22.130
<v Speaker 1>So that was really cool.</v>

197
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:22.760
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

198
00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.430
<v Speaker 1>it was really interesting to see that because those people are about,</v>

199
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.130
<v Speaker 1>they've had an unbroken culture for about 13,000 years.</v>

200
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.250
<v Speaker 1>That's how long they've been out out on the island there.</v>

201
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:35.210
<v Speaker 1>And it was very interesting to see that dramatization of the domestication of,</v>

202
00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:39.050
<v Speaker 1>of man by women laid out in that dance in that way.</v>

203
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:43.370
<v Speaker 1>But it was also interesting in relationship to the shamanic tradition because he</v>

204
00:07:43.371 --> 00:07:44.540
<v Speaker 1>came in as a wild man,</v>

205
00:07:44.541 --> 00:07:44.751
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

206
00:07:44.751 --> 00:07:49.640
<v Speaker 1>And he had to be re civilized in some sense and brought back down to earth.</v>

207
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:54.260
<v Speaker 1>So by whatever method he may have been designated,</v>

208
00:07:54.261 --> 00:07:55.970
<v Speaker 1>a showman is recognized as such,</v>

209
00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:59.030
<v Speaker 1>only after having received two methods of instruction.</v>

210
00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:01.190
<v Speaker 1>The first is ecstatic dreams,</v>

211
00:08:01.191 --> 00:08:02.330
<v Speaker 1>trances visions.</v>

212
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.460
<v Speaker 1>The other thing that this guy told me,</v>

213
00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:07.130
<v Speaker 1>and I have no reason to doubt him,</v>

214
00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:08.473
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

215
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:10.330
<v Speaker 1>he's also not illiterate person.</v>

216
00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:11.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

217
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:12.260
<v Speaker 1>and so has a great memory.</v>

218
00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:15.740
<v Speaker 1>He does carving traditional carving and he's very good at it.</v>

219
00:08:15.741 --> 00:08:20.560
<v Speaker 1>He carved a 53 foot totem pole that's now in front of the Museum of art in,</v>

220
00:08:20.561 --> 00:08:21.950
<v Speaker 1>in downtown Montreal.</v>

221
00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:23.120
<v Speaker 1>So if you ever go there,</v>

222
00:08:23.121 --> 00:08:23.990
<v Speaker 1>you can go see it.</v>

223
00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:25.370
<v Speaker 1>I won't be there forever,</v>

224
00:08:25.371 --> 00:08:26.450
<v Speaker 1>but it's there right now.</v>

225
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:28.183
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

226
00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:33.370
<v Speaker 1>he was taught to carve by his grandparents and he said that he dreamed in,</v>

227
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:33.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

228
00:08:33.981 --> 00:08:34.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

229
00:08:34.251 --> 00:08:35.720
<v Speaker 1>what the Haida images look like.</v>

230
00:08:35.721 --> 00:08:37.030
<v Speaker 1>So the Kwakwaka'Wakw cert,</v>

231
00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:40.610
<v Speaker 1>kind of like the hightest same sort of imagery he told me that he dreamed in</v>

232
00:08:40.611 --> 00:08:41.450
<v Speaker 1>those images.</v>

233
00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:42.830
<v Speaker 1>So when he dreams,</v>

234
00:08:42.831 --> 00:08:46.520
<v Speaker 1>that's the form that the things he dreams about takes.</v>

235
00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.730
<v Speaker 1>And he also said that he would talk to his grandparents and his dream.</v>

236
00:08:49.731 --> 00:08:53.000
<v Speaker 1>So if he was working on a piece of wood and trying to figure out how to carve</v>

237
00:08:53.001 --> 00:08:53.480
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

238
00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.620
<v Speaker 1>and he ran into a particularly difficult problem,</v>

239
00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:56.670
<v Speaker 1>he dream in his great,</v>

240
00:08:56.671 --> 00:08:59.250
<v Speaker 1>he'd have a conversation with his grandparents and they'd help him figure out</v>

241
00:08:59.251 --> 00:09:00.180
<v Speaker 1>how to solve the problem.</v>

242
00:09:00.181 --> 00:09:01.740
<v Speaker 1>And then he'd wake up and he could go carve the,</v>

243
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:02.641
<v Speaker 1>and the thing is,</v>

244
00:09:02.641 --> 00:09:05.610
<v Speaker 1>he told me these things sort of matter of factly,</v>

245
00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:06.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

246
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:06.960
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't,</v>

247
00:09:06.961 --> 00:09:07.794
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

248
00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:08.893
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like,</v>

249
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:09.470
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

250
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:11.990
<v Speaker 1>he was telling me these weird things that happened to him,</v>

251
00:09:11.991 --> 00:09:13.440
<v Speaker 1>although he was doing that to some degree.</v>

252
00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:14.473
<v Speaker 1>I asked him</v>

253
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.870
<v Speaker 1>a lot of questions about what he carved and what it all meant.</v>

254
00:09:18.871 --> 00:09:20.010
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

255
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:20.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

256
00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.620
<v Speaker 1>that was just part of his explanation of how he did it.</v>

257
00:09:22.621 --> 00:09:23.380
<v Speaker 1>And he,</v>

258
00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:28.320
<v Speaker 1>he carved me a couple of doors that I have in my house and one of them is quite</v>

259
00:09:28.321 --> 00:09:29.020
<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>

260
00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:29.761
<v Speaker 1>well the,</v>

261
00:09:29.761 --> 00:09:34.761
<v Speaker 1>to make a panel and there are an underwater scene and under the water there's a</v>

262
00:09:35.071 --> 00:09:35.904
<v Speaker 1>bunch of,</v>

263
00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:36.301
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

264
00:09:36.301 --> 00:09:37.740
<v Speaker 1>mythical monsters.</v>

265
00:09:37.741 --> 00:09:40.800
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are killer whales and I think there's an octopus down there and</v>

266
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.450
<v Speaker 1>carved in this particular style.</v>

267
00:09:42.451 --> 00:09:45.810
<v Speaker 1>And he said that the other thing that happens to him when he dreams as he goes</v>

268
00:09:45.811 --> 00:09:49.650
<v Speaker 1>down to the bottom of the water where these mythical creatures are and he gets</v>

269
00:09:49.651 --> 00:09:50.760
<v Speaker 1>inspiration from them.</v>

270
00:09:50.761 --> 00:09:53.880
<v Speaker 1>And so I thought that was extremely interesting to,</v>

271
00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:54.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

272
00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:55.343
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

273
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:58.800
<v Speaker 1>we don't know what a mine that isn't hyper civilized,</v>

274
00:09:58.801 --> 00:10:01.230
<v Speaker 1>let's say hyper literate,</v>

275
00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:01.620
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

276
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:02.460
<v Speaker 1>like our minds are,</v>

277
00:10:02.461 --> 00:10:05.250
<v Speaker 1>cause we're so bombarded by external stimuli can,</v>

278
00:10:05.251 --> 00:10:08.400
<v Speaker 1>we have no idea what the natural mind is like really.</v>

279
00:10:08.401 --> 00:10:10.500
<v Speaker 1>And so it was quite interesting to,</v>

280
00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:11.880
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

281
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:12.780
<v Speaker 1>to listen to that.</v>

282
00:10:12.781 --> 00:10:13.140
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

283
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:15.450
<v Speaker 1>and also to see the consequences cause you've quite a great,</v>

284
00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.710
<v Speaker 1>he's quite a great carver.</v>

285
00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:19.890
<v Speaker 1>So the first is ecstatic dreams,</v>

286
00:10:19.891 --> 00:10:20.740
<v Speaker 1>trances visions.</v>

287
00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:23.160
<v Speaker 1>The second is traditional shamonic techniques,</v>

288
00:10:23.161 --> 00:10:27.030
<v Speaker 1>names and functions of the spirits methodology and genealogy of the clan.</v>

289
00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:28.140
<v Speaker 1>A secret language.</v>

290
00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:31.680
<v Speaker 1>This two fold teaching imparted by the spirits and the old master Sherman's</v>

291
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:33.000
<v Speaker 1>constitutes initiation.</v>

292
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:33.571
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

293
00:10:33.571 --> 00:10:34.740
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

294
00:10:34.741 --> 00:10:37.710
<v Speaker 1>modern people have a problem with that because we don't really get initiated.</v>

295
00:10:37.711 --> 00:10:38.910
<v Speaker 1>But I would say</v>

296
00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:44.991
<v Speaker 1>it all,</v>

297
00:10:44.991 --> 00:10:48.860
<v Speaker 1>let's say that we're each on a quest of some sort or you wouldn't be here,</v>

298
00:10:48.861 --> 00:10:49.571
<v Speaker 1>I don't think if,</v>

299
00:10:49.571 --> 00:10:51.890
<v Speaker 1>if you weren't because why else would you be here?</v>

300
00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:53.133
<v Speaker 1>Can you eat?</v>

301
00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:56.240
<v Speaker 1>And so you're on a quest of some sort to figure out,</v>

302
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:58.310
<v Speaker 1>to struggle with the meaning of life,</v>

303
00:10:58.311 --> 00:10:59.144
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

304
00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:04.070
<v Speaker 1>And you don't want to do that alone because you only last like 70 years and good</v>

305
00:11:04.071 --> 00:11:05.090
<v Speaker 1>luck figuring it out on your,</v>

306
00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:05.811
<v Speaker 1>on your own.</v>

307
00:11:05.811 --> 00:11:06.860
<v Speaker 1>It's just not going to happen.</v>

308
00:11:06.861 --> 00:11:09.560
<v Speaker 1>It's too complicated and you'll be too isolated,</v>

309
00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:09.980
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

310
00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:10.150
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

311
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:11.270
<v Speaker 1>if it's just you,</v>

312
00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:12.440
<v Speaker 1>that's insanity.</v>

313
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:14.000
<v Speaker 1>That's no one can stand that.</v>

314
00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:17.720
<v Speaker 1>And so you hope that other people have things to tell you when that your culture</v>

315
00:11:17.721 --> 00:11:18.710
<v Speaker 1>has something to tell you.</v>

316
00:11:18.711 --> 00:11:18.950
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

317
00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:20.030
<v Speaker 1>so you're on a quest,</v>

318
00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:24.440
<v Speaker 1>maybe not with the same intensity as a shit shamonic initiat but you know,</v>

319
00:11:24.441 --> 00:11:25.550
<v Speaker 1>let's give you some credit.</v>

320
00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:30.880
<v Speaker 1>And then you're also trying to understand the wisdom of the past and that that's</v>

321
00:11:31.101 --> 00:11:32.120
<v Speaker 1>the second part of this.</v>

322
00:11:32.121 --> 00:11:32.481
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

323
00:11:32.481 --> 00:11:32.751
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

324
00:11:32.751 --> 00:11:35.480
<v Speaker 1>well you're a human being and human beings have been telling stories for a long</v>

325
00:11:35.481 --> 00:11:37.820
<v Speaker 1>period of time trying to figure out what's going on,</v>

326
00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:39.920
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out how to orient themselves in the world.</v>

327
00:11:39.921 --> 00:11:44.470
<v Speaker 1>And so partly what you're doing here is exactly what the shamonic initiates does</v>

328
00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:46.010
<v Speaker 1>in the second part of the process,</v>

329
00:11:46.011 --> 00:11:51.011
<v Speaker 1>which is to expose yourself to the degree that you can to names and functions of</v>

330
00:11:51.951 --> 00:11:52.750
<v Speaker 1>the spirits,</v>

331
00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:56.770
<v Speaker 1>mythology and genealogy of the clan and the secret language.</v>

332
00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:01.030
<v Speaker 1>There's two fold teaching imparted by the spirits and the old master Schamens</v>

333
00:12:01.031 --> 00:12:02.380
<v Speaker 1>constitutes initiation.</v>

334
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:04.000
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

335
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:04.870
<v Speaker 1>that's the rebirth,</v>

336
00:12:04.871 --> 00:12:05.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

337
00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:05.920
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

338
00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.450
<v Speaker 1>that's what initiation is.</v>

339
00:12:07.451 --> 00:12:10.070
<v Speaker 1>It's being born again and,</v>

340
00:12:10.071 --> 00:12:12.970
<v Speaker 1>and that's a birth of the spirit rather than of the body.</v>

341
00:12:12.971 --> 00:12:13.870
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

342
00:12:13.871 --> 00:12:16.390
<v Speaker 1>And so it's the rebirth of an integrated psyche.</v>

343
00:12:16.391 --> 00:12:18.910
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking about it and a psyche that's,</v>

344
00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:20.770
<v Speaker 1>that's individual,</v>

345
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:25.300
<v Speaker 1>but also grounded in common humanity and the wisdom of common humanity.</v>

346
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:26.950
<v Speaker 1>And that makes you strong,</v>

347
00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.810
<v Speaker 1>or at least it makes you stronger.</v>
