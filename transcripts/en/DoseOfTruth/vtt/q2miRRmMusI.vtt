<v Speaker 1>Richard Boyle says,</v>

2
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:09.241
<v Speaker 1>hi,</v>

3
00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:09.961
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Peterson,</v>

4
00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:14.550
<v Speaker 1>how does this score of 91 for compassion and one for politeness equals a score</v>

5
00:00:14.551 --> 00:00:16.080
<v Speaker 1>of 35 for agreeableness?</v>

6
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:16.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.820
<v Speaker 1>While it's because 91 and one aren't ordinary numbers,</v>

8
00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:24.390
<v Speaker 1>their percentiles and you can't just average percentiles,</v>

9
00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:25.470
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't work that way.</v>

10
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:27.360
<v Speaker 1>What it says is that</v>

11
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.431
<v Speaker 1>at sea,</v>

12
00:00:29.431 --> 00:00:33.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I can generate at just a description on the fly because I'm not,</v>

13
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.450
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say I'm particularly mathematically gifted,</v>

14
00:00:36.451 --> 00:00:38.910
<v Speaker 1>although I know that the answer I just gave you is correct.</v>

15
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:40.463
<v Speaker 1>Let's see,</v>

16
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.900
<v Speaker 1>there's a one in,</v>

17
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.830
<v Speaker 1>there's a one in 10 chance that a person would be that compassionate and a one</v>

18
00:00:46.831 --> 00:00:49.920
<v Speaker 1>and 100% chance that a person would be that,</v>

19
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:51.143
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

20
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.010
<v Speaker 1>that uh,</v>

21
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.640
<v Speaker 1>nope,</v>

22
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.990
<v Speaker 1>I can't generate it on the fly,</v>

23
00:00:54.991 --> 00:00:56.100
<v Speaker 1>but that's the answer.</v>

24
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.820
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to point to the proper literature,</v>

25
00:00:59.821 --> 00:01:00.780
<v Speaker 1>you'd look up,</v>

26
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.423
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.463
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

28
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.710
<v Speaker 1>how to transform percentiles into z scores.</v>

29
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.360
<v Speaker 1>They're called z scores,</v>

30
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:10.523
<v Speaker 1>then you can,</v>

31
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.370
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

32
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.491
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

33
00:01:11.491 --> 00:01:12.324
<v Speaker 1>that's how it works.</v>

34
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.760
<v Speaker 1>You convert the percentiles in disease scores,</v>

35
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.600
<v Speaker 1>you some the z scores and then you reconvert them into percentiles.</v>

36
00:01:18.601 --> 00:01:23.601
<v Speaker 1>And so if you take the z score for not for compassion 91 and the z score for</v>

37
00:01:23.611 --> 00:01:24.630
<v Speaker 1>politeness one,</v>

38
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.830
<v Speaker 1>add them,</v>

39
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.230
<v Speaker 1>divide them into and reconvert them to a percentile,</v>

40
00:01:28.231 --> 00:01:29.490
<v Speaker 1>you'll get 35 I know.</v>

41
00:01:29.491 --> 00:01:29.941
<v Speaker 1>It's weird,</v>

42
00:01:29.941 --> 00:01:30.300
<v Speaker 1>but that's,</v>

43
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.170
<v Speaker 1>that's how it,</v>

44
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.700
<v Speaker 1>that's how it is.</v>

45
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.560
<v Speaker 1>That's how it's done.</v>
