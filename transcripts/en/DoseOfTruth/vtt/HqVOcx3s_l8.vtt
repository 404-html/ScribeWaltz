1
00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:07.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.120
<v Speaker 2>Can you share with us your reading habits?</v>

3
00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:09.954
<v Speaker 2>Max says,</v>

4
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry I'm skipping over some questions but I have to answer some easier ones</v>

5
00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:17.070
<v Speaker 2>because I'm out of the capacity to answer difficult ones.</v>

6
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:19.220
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

7
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.570
<v Speaker 2>I'll answer this one instead.</v>

8
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.790
<v Speaker 2>If you could talk to Donald Trump for a day,</v>

9
00:00:22.791 --> 00:00:25.130
<v Speaker 2>what would you try to say or convinced them about?</v>

10
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I would try to convince them about things.</v>

11
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't actually try to convince people about things.</v>

12
00:00:31.071 --> 00:00:33.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I tried to ask them.</v>

13
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.930
<v Speaker 2>I'd ask him a whole bunch of questions.</v>

14
00:00:35.931 --> 00:00:39.230
<v Speaker 2>I try to figure out how we thought cause I'm really curious about that.</v>

15
00:00:39.231 --> 00:00:40.820
<v Speaker 2>I'd ask them all sorts of questions,</v>

16
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.841
<v Speaker 2>ask,</v>

17
00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:43.610
<v Speaker 2>see if I could find out what he was up to.</v>

18
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.170
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to know what he's aiming at.</v>

19
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.110
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to know why he thinks he became president,</v>

20
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.973
<v Speaker 2>what he did right,</v>

21
00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.000
<v Speaker 2>what he did wrong,</v>

22
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.701
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

23
00:00:50.701 --> 00:00:52.040
<v Speaker 2>what he dreads,</v>

24
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.980
<v Speaker 2>like what he would consider a catastrophic failure,</v>

25
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.410
<v Speaker 2>where he thinks his biggest weaknesses are,</v>

26
00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.210
<v Speaker 2>what he'd like to leave as a,</v>

27
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:00.620
<v Speaker 2>as a legacy.</v>

28
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.933
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

29
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.040
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

30
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.150
<v Speaker 2>That would be fascinating.</v>

31
00:01:04.151 --> 00:01:04.984
<v Speaker 2>But see,</v>

32
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.150
<v Speaker 2>I find generally speaking,</v>

33
00:01:07.151 --> 00:01:10.330
<v Speaker 2>it's much more interesting to ask people questions,</v>

34
00:01:10.331 --> 00:01:11.680
<v Speaker 2>especially people like that,</v>

35
00:01:11.681 --> 00:01:13.450
<v Speaker 2>than ever to try to convince them of things.</v>

36
00:01:13.451 --> 00:01:14.890
<v Speaker 2>Because the thing is,</v>

37
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.030
<v Speaker 2>I already know what I know,</v>

38
00:01:16.031 --> 00:01:18.340
<v Speaker 2>but I have no idea what he knows or what he's like.</v>

39
00:01:18.341 --> 00:01:20.950
<v Speaker 2>And so it'd be amazing to be able to talk to them.</v>

40
00:01:20.951 --> 00:01:24.790
<v Speaker 2>And so I have a bit of that opportunity now in Canada because I've been speaking</v>

41
00:01:24.791 --> 00:01:26.500
<v Speaker 2>to a lot of political figures in Canada.</v>

42
00:01:26.501 --> 00:01:28.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have that opportunity in Europe.</v>

43
00:01:28.301 --> 00:01:29.500
<v Speaker 2>But a lot of,</v>

44
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.090
<v Speaker 2>a lot of what you want to do when you meet people is ask them questions because,</v>

45
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.391
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

46
00:01:34.391 --> 00:01:36.280
<v Speaker 2>they'll tell you all sorts of things you don't know.</v>

47
00:01:36.281 --> 00:01:36.860
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

48
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:37.210
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

49
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.690
<v Speaker 2>that's also an entry point to a really good conversation is to ask questions.</v>

50
00:01:40.691 --> 00:01:41.620
<v Speaker 2>So that's what I would do.</v>

51
00:01:41.621 --> 00:01:44.740
<v Speaker 2>I'd ask questions like mad until he chased me away.</v>

52
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.933
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

53
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.300
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
