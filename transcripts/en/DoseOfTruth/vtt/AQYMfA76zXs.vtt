1
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.580
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to ask you a couple things about that.</v>

2
00:00:10.581 --> 00:00:11.900
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

3
00:00:11.901 --> 00:00:16.370
<v Speaker 1>the big five research into political differences basically shows that the</v>

4
00:00:16.371 --> 00:00:17.540
<v Speaker 1>liberals are high in trade,</v>

5
00:00:17.541 --> 00:00:20.810
<v Speaker 1>openness and low and treat conscientiousness and the conservatives or the</v>

6
00:00:20.811 --> 00:00:21.500
<v Speaker 1>reverse,</v>

7
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.260
<v Speaker 1>but we've fragmented conscientiousness into orderliness and industriousness with</v>

8
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.800
<v Speaker 1>the big five aspect scale and orderliness is strongly associated with disgust,</v>

9
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.210
<v Speaker 1>so so,</v>

10
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:33.043
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

11
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.920
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

12
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:34.191
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

13
00:00:34.191 --> 00:00:34.701
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

14
00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:36.470
<v Speaker 1>It does sound a lot like Freud but it,</v>

15
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.490
<v Speaker 1>but it also is in accordance with your observations that conservatives have neat</v>

16
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.061
<v Speaker 1>spaces,</v>

17
00:00:41.061 --> 00:00:41.691
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

18
00:00:41.691 --> 00:00:42.524
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

19
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.120
<v Speaker 1>so now and they're meeting start on time.</v>

20
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.930
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

21
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:45.171
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

22
00:00:45.171 --> 00:00:45.681
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

23
00:00:45.681 --> 00:00:46.280
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

24
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.581
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

25
00:00:46.581 --> 00:00:47.414
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

26
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.550
<v Speaker 1>so then the next is for political belief seems to be openness,</v>

27
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.020
<v Speaker 1>so that that exploratory tendency that you talked about exploration of ideas and</v>

28
00:00:57.021 --> 00:00:59.990
<v Speaker 1>creativity and low orderliness.</v>

29
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.371
<v Speaker 1>And so then I thought,</v>

30
00:01:01.371 --> 00:01:02.510
<v Speaker 1>well why in the world would,</v>

31
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.840
<v Speaker 1>why would the political nexus go across those dimensions,</v>

32
00:01:05.841 --> 00:01:07.940
<v Speaker 1>which are some relatively uncorrelated?</v>

33
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.203
<v Speaker 1>Then I thought,</v>

34
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.750
<v Speaker 1>and this is in keeping with your work on discussed,</v>

35
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.910
<v Speaker 1>is that it's an issue of borders,</v>

36
00:01:13.911 --> 00:01:17.570
<v Speaker 1>which of course seems more or less self evident in the wake of Trump's election</v>

37
00:01:17.571 --> 00:01:18.710
<v Speaker 1>when he talked about borders.</v>

38
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.780
<v Speaker 1>But you might say,</v>

39
00:01:20.781 --> 00:01:22.280
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is reasonable,</v>

40
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.260
<v Speaker 1>that the conservative is someone who wants the borders between categories to</v>

41
00:01:27.261 --> 00:01:30.230
<v Speaker 1>remain intact no matter what level of analysis.</v>

42
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.240
<v Speaker 1>So it's borders from the highest resolution level of cognition all the way up to</v>

43
00:01:35.241 --> 00:01:37.340
<v Speaker 1>the actual physical borders of,</v>

44
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.730
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

45
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:38.690
<v Speaker 1>of rooms,</v>

46
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:39.590
<v Speaker 1>towns,</v>

47
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:40.670
<v Speaker 1>states,</v>

48
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:41.361
<v Speaker 1>countries,</v>

49
00:01:41.361 --> 00:01:41.871
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>

50
00:01:41.871 --> 00:01:45.590
<v Speaker 1>So the borders should be thicker and the reason they want that.</v>

51
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.930
<v Speaker 1>Now there is a paper published in plause one,</v>

52
00:01:47.931 --> 00:01:48.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you saw it,</v>

53
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.850
<v Speaker 1>it was a couple of years ago.</v>

54
00:01:49.851 --> 00:01:51.140
<v Speaker 1>It was a mind boggling paper.</v>

55
00:01:51.141 --> 00:01:53.750
<v Speaker 1>It should have been like front page news as far as I was concerned.</v>

56
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.260
<v Speaker 1>And what the researchers did was between countries and then within provinces or</v>

57
00:01:59.721 --> 00:02:01.100
<v Speaker 1>states within countries,</v>

58
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.580
<v Speaker 1>they correlated the level of um,</v>

59
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.090
<v Speaker 1>of frequency of infectious disease with authoritarian political beliefs and</v>

60
00:02:11.961 --> 00:02:13.360
<v Speaker 1>found a wallop correlation.</v>

61
00:02:13.361 --> 00:02:14.390
<v Speaker 1>It was like 0.6.</v>

62
00:02:14.391 --> 00:02:16.020
<v Speaker 1>It was one of the highest by far,</v>

63
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.570
<v Speaker 1>for those of you who don't know,</v>

64
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.020
<v Speaker 1>social scientists never discover anything that's associated with anything else</v>

65
00:02:21.021 --> 00:02:23.630
<v Speaker 1>at a correlation of 0.6 other than heritability.</v>

66
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:24.090
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

67
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.160
<v Speaker 1>Other than heritability.</v>

68
00:02:25.161 --> 00:02:25.790
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

69
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.330
<v Speaker 1>And so what they found was that the higher the prevalence of infectious disease,</v>

70
00:02:29.331 --> 00:02:30.590
<v Speaker 1>the higher the probability of,</v>

71
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.070
<v Speaker 1>of totalitarian authoritarian political attitudes.</v>

72
00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:37.730
<v Speaker 1>And then they controlled for governance because one of the questions was,</v>

73
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.810
<v Speaker 1>was this top down authoritarianism or bottom up authoritarianism?</v>

74
00:02:41.811 --> 00:02:43.490
<v Speaker 1>And the answer was that it was bought them up.</v>

75
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:44.091
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

76
00:02:44.091 --> 00:02:49.091
<v Speaker 1>And so I thought about that in two from two perspectives simultaneously at the</v>

77
00:02:50.781 --> 00:02:51.614
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

78
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.860
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

79
00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.090
<v Speaker 1>So we identified disgust,</v>

80
00:02:53.091 --> 00:02:54.530
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity with orderliness.</v>

81
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.690
<v Speaker 1>So let's say a fundamental sub trait.</v>

82
00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.300
<v Speaker 1>Then I was reading this book that was called Hitler's table talk.</v>

83
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:02.111
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>

84
00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:02.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

85
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.330
<v Speaker 1>it was the recordings of virtually everything he said at dinner from 1939 to</v>

86
00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:08.141
<v Speaker 1>1942.</v>

87
00:03:08.141 --> 00:03:08.321
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

88
00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:10.270
<v Speaker 1>So it's a spontaneous utterance say,</v>

89
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:11.463
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

90
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.423
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

91
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.680
<v Speaker 1>it's full of discussions about Jews and Gypsies and all the people he tormented.</v>

92
00:03:17.681 --> 00:03:20.410
<v Speaker 1>But what's really interesting is all the language is discussed.</v>

93
00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.970
<v Speaker 1>It's not fear.</v>

94
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.661
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

95
00:03:22.661 --> 00:03:27.661
<v Speaker 1>so Hitler's basic metaphor was that the Aryan race and country was a pure body,</v>

96
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.210
<v Speaker 1>and then it was assaulted by parasites.</v>

97
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.571
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

98
00:03:31.571 --> 00:03:34.930
<v Speaker 1>And then I remembered what happened to the native Americans when the Europeans</v>

99
00:03:34.931 --> 00:03:36.370
<v Speaker 1>showed up and she'll cans.</v>

100
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.940
<v Speaker 1>What happened was that 95% of them were dead within 50 years.</v>

101
00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:40.181
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

102
00:03:40.181 --> 00:03:42.100
<v Speaker 1>Because of smallpox and measles.</v>

103
00:03:42.101 --> 00:03:43.960
<v Speaker 1>And so that,</v>

104
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.220
<v Speaker 1>that border issue that separates conservatives from liberals,</v>

105
00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:49.510
<v Speaker 1>let's say as the conservative,</v>

106
00:03:49.511 --> 00:03:53.290
<v Speaker 1>say the novel is potentially contaminated.</v>

107
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.970
<v Speaker 1>It's not so much that it's dangerous.</v>

108
00:03:54.971 --> 00:03:55.631
<v Speaker 1>That's different.</v>

109
00:03:55.631 --> 00:03:56.290
<v Speaker 1>That's fear.</v>

110
00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.220
<v Speaker 1>It's contaminated.</v>

111
00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:58.241
<v Speaker 1>And the Liberals say,</v>

112
00:03:58.241 --> 00:03:59.074
<v Speaker 1>hold on a minute.</v>

113
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.820
<v Speaker 1>If you make the borders too thick,</v>

114
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.530
<v Speaker 1>then information can't pass through.</v>

115
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.460
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

116
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.840
<v Speaker 1>That's the Omnivore's dilemma right there.</v>

117
00:04:04.841 --> 00:04:05.410
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

118
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.850
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

119
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.280
<v Speaker 1>And then since we have a biological architecture on,</v>

120
00:04:09.281 --> 00:04:11.500
<v Speaker 1>which are cognitive platforms are erected,</v>

121
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.130
<v Speaker 1>we have the same attitude towards abstract information,</v>

122
00:04:15.131 --> 00:04:18.720
<v Speaker 1>which would be ideas that we do to things like food or,</v>

123
00:04:18.721 --> 00:04:19.690
<v Speaker 1>or illness.</v>

124
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:20.290
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

125
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:20.561
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

126
00:04:20.561 --> 00:04:24.820
<v Speaker 1>And so we can think of an invading idea or a polluting idea or contaminated.</v>

127
00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.861
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

128
00:04:25.861 --> 00:04:27.750
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm a big fan of George Lakoff metaphors.</v>

129
00:04:27.751 --> 00:04:29.130
<v Speaker 1>We live by a,</v>

130
00:04:29.131 --> 00:04:29.641
<v Speaker 1>that we,</v>

131
00:04:29.641 --> 00:04:29.821
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

132
00:04:29.821 --> 00:04:31.290
<v Speaker 1>we use our bodily,</v>

133
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.240
<v Speaker 1>our bodily ski Mada to think about abstract things like politics and like what</v>

134
00:04:36.241 --> 00:04:38.550
<v Speaker 1>our policies should be about borders and immigration.</v>

135
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:39.080
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

136
00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.080
<v Speaker 1>there's a Canadian psychologist,</v>

137
00:04:40.081 --> 00:04:40.741
<v Speaker 1>Mark Shaller,</v>

138
00:04:40.741 --> 00:04:43.840
<v Speaker 1>he and his colleagues have developed what they call an account of these,</v>

139
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.480
<v Speaker 1>the behavioral immune system,</v>

140
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:46.020
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

141
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.160
<v Speaker 1>That we don't just try to,</v>

142
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.123
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

143
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.110
<v Speaker 1>microbes killed probably many more of our ancestors then did lions and tigers</v>

144
00:04:52.111 --> 00:04:52.944
<v Speaker 1>and bears.</v>

145
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.960
<v Speaker 1>And so whoever can keep themselves and their children from being exposed to</v>

146
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.330
<v Speaker 1>fatal illnesses wins the evolutionary game.</v>

147
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.300
<v Speaker 1>And so a lot of that is judging carefully about people.</v>

148
00:05:03.301 --> 00:05:03.961
<v Speaker 1>Is he dangerous?</v>

149
00:05:03.961 --> 00:05:04.800
<v Speaker 1>Is She dangerous?</v>

150
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.540
<v Speaker 1>And that's both for sexuality,</v>

151
00:05:06.541 --> 00:05:07.440
<v Speaker 1>for contact,</v>

152
00:05:07.441 --> 00:05:08.850
<v Speaker 1>for all kinds of association.</v>

153
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.541
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

154
00:05:09.541 --> 00:05:09.901
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

155
00:05:09.901 --> 00:05:13.830
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of ways our emotions and our bodily interactions structure,</v>

156
00:05:13.831 --> 00:05:15.570
<v Speaker 1>how we think and feel about,</v>

157
00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:16.620
<v Speaker 1>about social,</v>

158
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:17.051
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

159
00:05:17.051 --> 00:05:18.850
<v Speaker 1>even with the black death in Europe,</v>

160
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:19.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

161
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.870
<v Speaker 1>so the black death occurred in Europe when the Europeans started to move around</v>

162
00:05:22.871 --> 00:05:25.300
<v Speaker 1>the world and they brought back rats that were infected.</v>

163
00:05:25.301 --> 00:05:25.871
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

164
00:05:25.871 --> 00:05:26.171
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

165
00:05:26.171 --> 00:05:29.410
<v Speaker 1>so what you saw there was both of those forces at work at the same time.</v>

166
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.060
<v Speaker 1>So the European expansion produced a tremendous interchange of ideas from all</v>

167
00:05:34.061 --> 00:05:34.781
<v Speaker 1>around the world.</v>

168
00:05:34.781 --> 00:05:35.830
<v Speaker 1>That's globalization,</v>

169
00:05:35.831 --> 00:05:39.550
<v Speaker 1>but it wiped out somewhere between 30 and 60% of the population at the same</v>

170
00:05:39.551 --> 00:05:40.120
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

171
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
