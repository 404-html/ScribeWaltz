00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:00.973
<v Speaker 1>Hmm,</v>

2
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.440
<v Speaker 1>roughly 95 percent of the lyrics in pop</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture or about mating or there about</v>

3
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.090
<v Speaker 1>mating rituals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are about courtship rituals and</v>

4
00:00:15.091 --> 00:00:19.470
<v Speaker 1>you as a person who is white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the meeting has been upgraded by the</v>

5
00:00:19.471 --> 00:00:22.080
<v Speaker 1>best and now includes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

6
00:00:22.081 --> 00:00:25.470
<v Speaker 1>God knows what it was trying to tell us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at any rate,</v>

7
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.700
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have just emerged from childhood,</v>

8
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.470
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your hormones,</v>

9
00:00:31.471 --> 00:00:36.120
<v Speaker 1>your sexual hormones and begun to act</v>
<v Speaker 1>girls as young as 11 can become pregnant</v>

10
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.240
<v Speaker 1>already and you were obsessed with</v>
<v Speaker 1>finding your place in the world and</v>

11
00:00:41.521 --> 00:00:46.521
<v Speaker 1>finding a mate and courtship rituals</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean an awful lot to you there about to</v>

12
00:00:46.871 --> 00:00:50.200
<v Speaker 1>what they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you were about to embark on for the</v>

13
00:00:50.201 --> 00:00:53.210
<v Speaker 1>next 10 years of your life at least.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

14
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.040
<v Speaker 1>and so this obsession with courtship</v>
<v Speaker 1>rituals with mating and dating and</v>

15
00:00:58.041 --> 00:01:01.250
<v Speaker 1>breaking up and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and be trail and all of that kind of</v>

16
00:01:01.251 --> 00:01:03.830
<v Speaker 1>stuff makes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes absolute sense.</v>

17
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.081
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

18
00:01:05.081 --> 00:01:07.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the thing is music frames that too</v>

19
00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:10.390
<v Speaker 1>because it gives you something that's in</v>
<v Speaker 1>common with your potential mate.</v>

20
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.280
<v Speaker 1>And it also gives you a set of rather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say stereotyped activities,</v>

21
00:01:15.281 --> 00:01:18.640
<v Speaker 1>but at least predictable activities that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are associated with courtship and made</v>

22
00:01:18.641 --> 00:01:20.950
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that would be going to concerts and</v>

23
00:01:20.951 --> 00:01:24.700
<v Speaker 1>going to movies which are heavily</v>
<v Speaker 1>musically influenced and dancing and,</v>

24
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.650
<v Speaker 1>and even discussing your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your shared immersement in whatever that</v>

25
00:01:29.651 --> 00:01:31.450
<v Speaker 1>subculture happens to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

26
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.640
<v Speaker 1>And my guess is that at some point music</v>
<v Speaker 1>provokes oxytocin because oxytocin is</v>

27
00:01:37.981 --> 00:01:42.981
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate bonding hormone and music</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a bath in the sense of human</v>

28
00:01:43.471 --> 00:01:46.500
<v Speaker 1>belonging in the field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even if you're alone and you're</v>

29
00:01:46.501 --> 00:01:50.040
<v Speaker 1>listening to Pandora or spotify all by</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

30
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.940
<v Speaker 1>it feeds you social,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bread and meat.</v>

31
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.480
<v Speaker 1>And in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the nervous system,</v>

32
00:01:56.481 --> 00:02:00.560
<v Speaker 1>the central nervous system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything boils down to inhibition or</v>

33
00:02:00.561 --> 00:02:04.160
<v Speaker 1>excitation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a hormone of excitation and</v>

34
00:02:04.161 --> 00:02:07.220
<v Speaker 1>it's glutamate is a hormone of</v>
<v Speaker 1>inhibition,</v>

35
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.700
<v Speaker 1>and that's the Gaba and oxytocin feeds</v>
<v Speaker 1>down into the Gaba system.</v>

36
00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.850
<v Speaker 1>The system that keeps you calm down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically,</v>

37
00:02:14.851 --> 00:02:16.350
<v Speaker 1>it gives you a sense of peace.</v>
