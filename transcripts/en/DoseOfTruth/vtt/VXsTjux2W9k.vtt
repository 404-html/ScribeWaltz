1
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:07.071
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2
00:00:07.071 --> 00:00:12.071
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason that the Germans preferred Hitler to chaos was because they</v>

3
00:00:12.861 --> 00:00:17.861
<v Speaker 1>felt that the order that Hitler promised repressive as it was,</v>

4
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.090
<v Speaker 1>it was preferable to the chaos that was likely to ensue in its absence.</v>

5
00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.350
<v Speaker 1>What is it about chaos that's so terrifying?</v>

6
00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.500
<v Speaker 1>Second Nature said,</v>

7
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.920
<v Speaker 1>adopting a belief system of any sort and imposing coherency on the world,</v>

8
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.830
<v Speaker 1>viewing it through the lens of that explicit system disciplines your mind,</v>

9
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.550
<v Speaker 1>so for example,</v>

10
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.290
<v Speaker 1>to live in the absence of any stated beliefs is hardly to live at all.</v>

11
00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.530
<v Speaker 1>To live in the presence of a narrow minded and extreme belief system is at least</v>

12
00:01:02.871 --> 00:01:04.370
<v Speaker 1>to undergo the rigors,</v>

13
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.690
<v Speaker 1>both behavioral and intellectual of coming to terms with the world.</v>

14
00:01:08.691 --> 00:01:10.310
<v Speaker 1>From some perspective,</v>

15
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.360
<v Speaker 1>Nisha said the reason that the modern mind such as it is,</v>

16
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.810
<v Speaker 1>was able to free itself from the past at all was because it had first thoroughly</v>

17
00:01:25.381 --> 00:01:29.790
<v Speaker 1>subjected itself to the tyranny that was imposed by the past.</v>

18
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.230
<v Speaker 1>In consequence,</v>

19
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.760
<v Speaker 1>disciplined itself developed enough discipline as a consequence of that</v>

20
00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:37.860
<v Speaker 1>subordination to then break free of it</v>

21
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.960
<v Speaker 1>in all science of morals so far.</v>

22
00:01:45.961 --> 00:01:46.890
<v Speaker 1>One thing was lacking.</v>

23
00:01:46.891 --> 00:01:48.060
<v Speaker 1>Strange as it may sound.</v>

24
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.950
<v Speaker 1>The problem with morality itself,</v>

25
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.250
<v Speaker 1>what was lacking was any suspicion that there was something problematic here.</v>

26
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.380
<v Speaker 1>Every society,</v>

27
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:56.970
<v Speaker 1>every functioning individual,</v>

28
00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.650
<v Speaker 1>every functioning family,</v>

29
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.890
<v Speaker 1>every social unit has a moral code,</v>

30
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:03.713
<v Speaker 1>but they differ.</v>

31
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.570
<v Speaker 1>So what does that mean exactly?</v>

32
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.961
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

33
00:02:06.961 --> 00:02:07.920
<v Speaker 1>it's complicated,</v>

34
00:02:07.921 --> 00:02:08.281
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

35
00:02:08.281 --> 00:02:11.340
<v Speaker 1>Because the fact of the university quality of the code,</v>

36
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.090
<v Speaker 1>the fact of the code indicates that the code or our code is necessary.</v>

37
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.870
<v Speaker 1>By the same token,</v>

38
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.130
<v Speaker 1>the fact that there's a multiplicity of codes seems to suggest that the</v>

39
00:02:23.131 --> 00:02:26.550
<v Speaker 1>particulars of a given code aren't necessarily relevant,</v>

40
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.860
<v Speaker 1>and so nature says brilliantly,</v>

41
00:02:28.861 --> 00:02:31.140
<v Speaker 1>I think we're faced with a problem.</v>

42
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.830
<v Speaker 1>No life without morality,</v>

43
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.840
<v Speaker 1>no absolute morality.</v>

44
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:38.790
<v Speaker 1>What do we do?</v>

45
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.540
<v Speaker 1>I wonder those things young observed was that if you look at the structure of</v>

46
00:02:42.541 --> 00:02:43.374
<v Speaker 1>stories,</v>

47
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.820
<v Speaker 1>you thought first there's a relationship between stories and moral codes.</v>

48
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

49
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.010
<v Speaker 1>seems relatively straight forward,</v>

50
00:02:50.011 --> 00:02:50.640
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>

51
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.340
<v Speaker 1>If you tell a simple story like a parable,</v>

52
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.400
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they're complex to like an aesop fable safe.</v>

53
00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.740
<v Speaker 1>What do you extract out from the story?</v>

54
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 1>Moral?</v>

55
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.300
<v Speaker 1>What's the moral,</v>

56
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.850
<v Speaker 1>what's the implication of this story for behavior?</v>

57
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:04.684
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

58
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.980
<v Speaker 1>So you tell a little story about someone who acts out and given moral code and</v>

59
00:03:08.981 --> 00:03:10.600
<v Speaker 1>that person does better or worse.</v>

60
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.240
<v Speaker 1>And the moral of this story is if you act in this manner,</v>

61
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.160
<v Speaker 1>you will do better or worse,</v>

62
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.570
<v Speaker 1>proverbial knowledge.</v>

63
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.450
<v Speaker 1>We all tell stories,</v>

64
00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.150
<v Speaker 1>they have identifiable structure.</v>

65
00:03:23.151 --> 00:03:27.260
<v Speaker 1>You can tell that because it's a movie studio in Hollywood can produce a movie</v>

66
00:03:27.261 --> 00:03:29.240
<v Speaker 1>and people all over the world will watch it.</v>

67
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:30.710
<v Speaker 1>People all over the world,</v>

68
00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.020
<v Speaker 1>all over the world tell stories to one another.</v>

69
00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.290
<v Speaker 1>The plot elements seem similar.</v>

70
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.240
<v Speaker 1>Are the morals similar?</v>

71
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.800
<v Speaker 1>That's a more difficult question,</v>

72
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.030
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

73
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.410
<v Speaker 1>We know that the details of morality can vary from culture to culture.</v>

74
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.660
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything that doesn't vary from culture to culture and why would you</v>

75
00:03:52.661 --> 00:03:53.650
<v Speaker 1>want to find that?</v>

76
00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

77
00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.430
<v Speaker 1>Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn thought that one of the most important occurrences of the</v>

78
00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:02.450
<v Speaker 1>20th century</v>

79
00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.410
<v Speaker 1>or the Nuremberg trials and Nuremberg trials brought the perpetual perpetrators</v>

80
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.560
<v Speaker 1>of the Nazi genocide to justice.</v>

81
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.390
<v Speaker 1>And it's easy to be cynical about that.</v>

82
00:04:16.391 --> 00:04:21.391
<v Speaker 1>And perhaps you shouldn't be cynical about it because the victors brought the</v>

83
00:04:21.521 --> 00:04:22.780
<v Speaker 1>losers to trial.</v>

84
00:04:22.781 --> 00:04:25.420
<v Speaker 1>And so of course the losers,</v>

85
00:04:25.421 --> 00:04:29.410
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be tried from the perspective of the winners moral code.</v>

86
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:30.670
<v Speaker 1>But Solzhenitsyn says,</v>

87
00:04:30.671 --> 00:04:31.001
<v Speaker 1>well wait,</v>

88
00:04:31.001 --> 00:04:31.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

89
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.180
<v Speaker 1>there's something more to this story.</v>

90
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:39.420
<v Speaker 1>At least there seems to be in that many of the events that characterized the</v>

91
00:04:41.651 --> 00:04:46.651
<v Speaker 1>Nazi atrocities were so awful outside of intellectual argumentation because you</v>

92
00:04:50.441 --> 00:04:52.660
<v Speaker 1>can provide an intellectual argument for anything.</v>

93
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.050
<v Speaker 1>They were so awful that the proper visceral embodied response of any observer,</v>

94
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.890
<v Speaker 1>regardless of specific moral code,</v>

95
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.330
<v Speaker 1>should be repugnant,</v>

96
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:05.463
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>

97
00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.570
<v Speaker 1>Such that encoded,</v>

98
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.510
<v Speaker 1>at least initially in international law,</v>

99
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:13.900
<v Speaker 1>genocide is a crime against humanity,</v>

100
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:15.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

101
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:20.370
<v Speaker 1>No matter what the particulars of your moral code so goes the logic.</v>

102
00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:26.410
<v Speaker 1>You cannot construct a viable moral code that enables genocide,</v>

103
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.830
<v Speaker 1>if not a logical impossibility.</v>

104
00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:31.960
<v Speaker 1>And I think it is a logical impossibility.</v>

105
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:33.790
<v Speaker 1>It's an ethical impossibility.</v>

106
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.680
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to ask yourself,</v>

107
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.100
<v Speaker 1>and this is not precisely and intellectual question,</v>

108
00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.620
<v Speaker 1>does that seem credible to you?</v>

109
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.240
<v Speaker 1>Cause it seemed credible that there are acts that are so terrible that no one,</v>

110
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.870
<v Speaker 1>regardless of their stated position,</v>

111
00:05:52.871 --> 00:05:54.280
<v Speaker 1>should ever engage in them.</v>

112
00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.410
<v Speaker 1>And if the answer is yes,</v>

113
00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.131
<v Speaker 1>then I would say,</v>

114
00:05:58.131 --> 00:05:58.580
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

115
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:03.580
<v Speaker 1>if you haven't moved towards personal except of acceptance of an ultimate up so</v>

116
00:06:06.051 --> 00:06:06.800
<v Speaker 1>to speak,</v>

117
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.330
<v Speaker 1>you've certainly identified at least one down that you don't want to approach.</v>

118
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:17.270
<v Speaker 1>And that's the beginnings of the establishment of some notion of absolute moral</v>

119
00:06:17.271 --> 00:06:17.810
<v Speaker 1>authority.</v>
