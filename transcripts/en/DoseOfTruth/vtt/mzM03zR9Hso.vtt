00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.710
<v Speaker 1>Once leadership,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the capacity to see what the hell's</v>

2
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.420
<v Speaker 1>in front of your face and maybe in every</v>
<v Speaker 1>direction and then the capacity to use</v>

3
00:00:09.421 --> 00:00:13.380
<v Speaker 1>your language properly in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>transformative manner and to transform</v>

4
00:00:13.381 --> 00:00:16.360
<v Speaker 1>chaos into order and God only know how</v>
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

5
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.890
<v Speaker 1>how long it took the Mesopotamians to</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure that out and the best they could</v>

6
00:00:19.891 --> 00:00:23.610
<v Speaker 1>do is dramatize it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's staggeringly brilliant.</v>

7
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.431
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

8
00:00:24.431 --> 00:00:29.431
<v Speaker 1>It's by no means obvious and this chaos</v>
<v Speaker 1>is chaos is a very strange thing and</v>

9
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.520
<v Speaker 1>this is the chaos that God wrestled with</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the beginning of time.</v>

10
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.930
<v Speaker 1>Chaos is what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's half psychological and half real.</v>

11
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.070
<v Speaker 1>There's no other way to really describe</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

12
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.800
<v Speaker 1>The chaos is what you encountered when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're thrown into deep confusion,</v>

13
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:45.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When your world falls apart,</v>

14
00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:47.880
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you encounter something that blows</v>

15
00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:49.740
<v Speaker 1>you into pieces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when your dreams die,</v>

16
00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:53.100
<v Speaker 1>when you're betrayed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the chaos that emerges and the</v>

17
00:00:53.101 --> 00:00:57.310
<v Speaker 1>chaos has everything at once and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>too much for you and that's for sure,</v>

18
00:00:57.311 --> 00:00:59.750
<v Speaker 1>and it pulls you down into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>underworld and all.</v>

19
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.760
<v Speaker 1>That's where the dragons are and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got at that point is your</v>

20
00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:05.910
<v Speaker 1>capacity to bloody well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep your eyes open and to speak as</v>

21
00:01:05.911 --> 00:01:09.240
<v Speaker 1>carefully and clearly as you can and</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe if you're lucky,</v>

22
00:01:09.241 --> 00:01:13.050
<v Speaker 1>you'll get through it that way and come</v>
<v Speaker 1>out the other side and it's taken people</v>

23
00:01:13.051 --> 00:01:14.790
<v Speaker 1>a very long time to figure that out.</v>
