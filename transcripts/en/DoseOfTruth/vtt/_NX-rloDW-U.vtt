00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.980
<v Speaker 1>Jobs are just disappearing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now let's ask the question.</v>

2
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.580
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything that could be done</v>
<v Speaker 1>about that?</v>

3
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your Western society is tried very hard</v>

4
00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:24.811
<v Speaker 1>with a number of environmental</v>
<v Speaker 1>environmentally based interventions,</v>

5
00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.450
<v Speaker 1>early childhood education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way that you said the.</v>

6
00:00:30.451 --> 00:00:34.540
<v Speaker 1>The literature in organizational</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology is very clear.</v>

7
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.040
<v Speaker 1>The winter jury is equally clear in</v>
<v Speaker 1>educational psychology.</v>

8
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the relationship between Iq and</v>

9
00:00:41.411 --> 00:00:45.430
<v Speaker 1>learning is more powerful than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship between Iq job performance,</v>

10
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.550
<v Speaker 1>that that's right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of common sense or matches</v>

11
00:00:48.551 --> 00:00:50.480
<v Speaker 1>are common sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

12
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.560
<v Speaker 1>if you put a bunch of variables into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>regression equation to predict academic</v>

13
00:00:55.871 --> 00:01:00.871
<v Speaker 1>achievement and you have all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>variables and teacher quality variables</v>

14
00:01:01.211 --> 00:01:06.211
<v Speaker 1>and cognitive variables of the students</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what you find is the teacher</v>

15
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.720
<v Speaker 1>variables and the quality of the school</v>
<v Speaker 1>variables to gather barely account for</v>

16
00:01:13.661 --> 00:01:16.090
<v Speaker 1>10 percent and I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

17
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.500
<v Speaker 1>It's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was terrible.</v>

18
00:01:17.501 --> 00:01:20.270
<v Speaker 1>You know what I told?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the guy who ran admissions at</v>

19
00:01:20.271 --> 00:01:21.920
<v Speaker 1>Harvard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I taught at Harvard for a while.</v>

20
00:01:21.921 --> 00:01:24.410
<v Speaker 1>His name was dean with law and he is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>really smart guy.</v>

21
00:01:24.411 --> 00:01:26.300
<v Speaker 1>I really liked the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

22
00:01:26.301 --> 00:01:29.480
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say he was on the right side of</v>

23
00:01:29.481 --> 00:01:33.740
<v Speaker 1>the human race and he was really trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to figure out how to run the admissions</v>

24
00:01:33.741 --> 00:01:37.730
<v Speaker 1>policy at Harvard so that it did the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best for everyone concerned and he had</v>

25
00:01:37.731 --> 00:01:41.150
<v Speaker 1>run an interesting series of analysis</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I don't believe he ever published.</v>

26
00:01:41.151 --> 00:01:45.320
<v Speaker 1>And one of them was um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let's say you segregate the Harvard</v>

27
00:01:45.321 --> 00:01:48.110
<v Speaker 1>population into the relatively low Iq</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>

28
00:01:48.111 --> 00:01:51.330
<v Speaker 1>So maybe they only have an Iq of 130,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.310
<v Speaker 1>and the relatively high Iq kids who were</v>
<v Speaker 1>pushing up towards 160.</v>

30
00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.730
<v Speaker 1>So you are two competing hypotheses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fair one would be that the lower Iq kids</v>

31
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.150
<v Speaker 1>come to Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this remarkable environment and they,</v>

32
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.500
<v Speaker 1>and they and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they thrive because of the high</v>

33
00:02:09.501 --> 00:02:14.501
<v Speaker 1>educational quality so well that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>close the gap between them and the one</v>

34
00:02:14.661 --> 00:02:16.760
<v Speaker 1>60 kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's just completely,</v>

35
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.520
<v Speaker 1>completely wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens is you put both those</v>

36
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.440
<v Speaker 1>groups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're both very,</v>

37
00:02:21.441 --> 00:02:24.680
<v Speaker 1>very highly selected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some,</v>

38
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:25.723
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this,</v>

39
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.910
<v Speaker 1>in a sort of superman rage</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectually.</v>

40
00:02:27.911 --> 00:02:31.100
<v Speaker 1>And what happens is the gap just gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger and bigger as they progress</v>

41
00:02:31.101 --> 00:02:34.970
<v Speaker 1>through university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a dreaded example of that,</v>

42
00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>matthew principle that the economists</v>

43
00:02:37.551 --> 00:02:41.480
<v Speaker 1>talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is no to those who have more will</v>

44
00:02:41.481 --> 00:02:43.270
<v Speaker 1>be given.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And from those who have nothing,</v>

45
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.420
<v Speaker 1>everything will be taken.</v>
