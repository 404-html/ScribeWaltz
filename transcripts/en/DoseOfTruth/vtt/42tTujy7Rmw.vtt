1
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.010
<v Speaker 1>So I went through some of the symbolism of the unknown.</v>

2
00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.060
<v Speaker 1>I want to go through some of the symbolism that's associated with the known</v>

3
00:00:14.061 --> 00:00:14.481
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

4
00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:15.590
<v Speaker 1>So give you some sense.</v>

5
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.620
<v Speaker 1>Flags are definitely patriarchal symbols.</v>

6
00:00:18.621 --> 00:00:20.030
<v Speaker 1>There's their cultural symbols,</v>

7
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.200
<v Speaker 1>and here's some.</v>

8
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.240
<v Speaker 1>I'll just lay out every variety of terms.</v>

9
00:00:23.241 --> 00:00:27.470
<v Speaker 1>And so that'll give you some indication of the network of associations that's</v>

10
00:00:27.471 --> 00:00:31.130
<v Speaker 1>associated with the symbol of the dominance hierarchy.</v>

11
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.113
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally,</v>

12
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.193
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

13
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.180
<v Speaker 1>Apple Linnaean control.</v>

14
00:00:35.181 --> 00:00:36.420
<v Speaker 1>That's after Apollo,</v>

15
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.540
<v Speaker 1>the god Super Ego,</v>

16
00:00:38.541 --> 00:00:39.261
<v Speaker 1>the conscious,</v>

17
00:00:39.261 --> 00:00:39.750
<v Speaker 1>the king,</v>

18
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:40.461
<v Speaker 1>the patriarch,</v>

19
00:00:40.461 --> 00:00:41.294
<v Speaker 1>the plow.</v>

20
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.100
<v Speaker 1>Cause the plow opens up the earth,</v>

21
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.420
<v Speaker 1>the Fallis Order and authority and the crushing weight of tradition,</v>

22
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.510
<v Speaker 1>the wise old man and the tyrant dogma,</v>

23
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:51.530
<v Speaker 1>the day sky,</v>

24
00:00:51.531 --> 00:00:52.311
<v Speaker 1>the country man,</v>

25
00:00:52.311 --> 00:00:52.851
<v Speaker 1>the island,</v>

26
00:00:52.851 --> 00:00:53.331
<v Speaker 1>the heights,</v>

27
00:00:53.331 --> 00:00:54.710
<v Speaker 1>the ancestral spirits,</v>

28
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.570
<v Speaker 1>and the activity of the dead.</v>

29
00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.960
<v Speaker 1>Now these symbolic realms or are kind of there,</v>

30
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.930
<v Speaker 1>there's there</v>

31
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.570
<v Speaker 1>situationally transformable.</v>

32
00:01:05.571 --> 00:01:09.290
<v Speaker 1>So if you look across cultures very frequently in stories,</v>

33
00:01:09.291 --> 00:01:12.440
<v Speaker 1>you see characters that exemplify each of these categories,</v>

34
00:01:12.441 --> 00:01:15.350
<v Speaker 1>but the characters can shift to some degree.</v>

35
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:16.041
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

36
00:01:16.041 --> 00:01:21.041
<v Speaker 1>so often if the story involves the ocean and an island than the ocean will be</v>

37
00:01:21.231 --> 00:01:22.430
<v Speaker 1>feminine in the island.</v>

38
00:01:22.431 --> 00:01:23.211
<v Speaker 1>Will be masculine.</v>

39
00:01:23.211 --> 00:01:27.470
<v Speaker 1>But if the story utilizes an island and the air,</v>

40
00:01:27.471 --> 00:01:29.450
<v Speaker 1>then the island will be feminine in the air,</v>

41
00:01:29.451 --> 00:01:30.261
<v Speaker 1>will be masculine.</v>

42
00:01:30.261 --> 00:01:35.261
<v Speaker 1>So it isn't as if there's a one to one correspondence between the entities in</v>

43
00:01:36.021 --> 00:01:40.640
<v Speaker 1>the story and these architectural categories because their definition depends</v>

44
00:01:40.641 --> 00:01:41.240
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

45
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.280
<v Speaker 1>they can't be defined in isolation.</v>

46
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.390
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

47
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.110
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

48
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.720
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of like does this really stupid example,</v>

49
00:01:47.721 --> 00:01:49.370
<v Speaker 1>but it's the best one I can come up with at the moment.</v>

50
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.560
<v Speaker 1>If you're trying to interpret statistics,</v>

51
00:01:51.561 --> 00:01:55.400
<v Speaker 1>you can't understand what a given statistic means unless you know the number of</v>

52
00:01:55.401 --> 00:01:56.480
<v Speaker 1>people in the experiment,</v>

53
00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.660
<v Speaker 1>the effect size and the probability that that effect size is that at emerged at</v>

54
00:02:01.971 --> 00:02:03.380
<v Speaker 1>a better than chance level.</v>

55
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.700
<v Speaker 1>Any of those pieces of information without the other two are actually</v>

56
00:02:07.701 --> 00:02:08.534
<v Speaker 1>meaningless.</v>

57
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.520
<v Speaker 1>And it's the same situation here.</v>

58
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.430
<v Speaker 1>You have to have the representation of culture and you have to have the</v>

59
00:02:13.431 --> 00:02:16.970
<v Speaker 1>representation of nature and you have to have the representation of the</v>

60
00:02:16.971 --> 00:02:20.180
<v Speaker 1>individual and then you can figure out what's,</v>

61
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.910
<v Speaker 1>what entities are being used in those different categories.</v>

62
00:02:22.911 --> 00:02:25.490
<v Speaker 1>Even though there's some similarity across stories,</v>

63
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.010
<v Speaker 1>which is partly why you could actually understand stories,</v>

64
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.521
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

65
00:02:28.521 --> 00:02:30.350
<v Speaker 1>Because if there was no similarity across them,</v>

66
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.180
<v Speaker 1>then you wouldn't be able to understand them.</v>

67
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.913
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

68
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.893
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

69
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.170
<v Speaker 1>there some representations of the great father.</v>
