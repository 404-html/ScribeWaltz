00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.420
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one person can wreak an awful lot of</v>

2
00:00:09.421 --> 00:00:11.550
<v Speaker 1>havoc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's absolutely no doubt about that.</v>

3
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.650
<v Speaker 1>And as we get more technologically</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful,</v>

4
00:00:13.651 --> 00:00:17.940
<v Speaker 1>that becomes even more relevant and</v>
<v Speaker 1>important and crucial.</v>

5
00:00:17.941 --> 00:00:19.890
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that you said was that</v>

6
00:00:19.891 --> 00:00:23.970
<v Speaker 1>we had to wake up because we are too</v>
<v Speaker 1>technologically powerful to be as</v>

7
00:00:23.971 --> 00:00:28.410
<v Speaker 1>morally asleep as we are and that seems</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me just to be self evident.</v>

8
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.010
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

9
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.970
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.140
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

11
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.920
<v Speaker 1>we're half asleep with nuclear bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good idea.</v>

12
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.570
<v Speaker 1>It's seriously not a good idea.</v>

13
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.303
<v Speaker 2>And so.</v>

14
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you might ask yourself too,</v>

15
00:00:43.421 --> 00:00:47.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what is the ultimate potential of a</v>

16
00:00:47.681 --> 00:00:52.681
<v Speaker 1>fully developed human being and well we</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly know that you have admiration</v>

17
00:00:53.411 --> 00:00:55.470
<v Speaker 1>for people who are more developed rather</v>
<v Speaker 1>than less.</v>

18
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.910
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that just happens automatic or</v>

19
00:00:58.911 --> 00:01:00.680
<v Speaker 1>resentment that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's okay.</v>

20
00:01:00.681 --> 00:01:02.210
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter,</v>

21
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.710
<v Speaker 1>but it's not like you can identify that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can identify them and they're put</v>

22
00:01:06.711 --> 00:01:08.100
<v Speaker 1>forward to you in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

23
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.490
<v Speaker 1>in drama and fiction and all of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly.</v>

24
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.100
<v Speaker 1>So that's another form of moral</v>
<v Speaker 1>intuition.</v>

25
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.993
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can read,</v>

26
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.980
<v Speaker 1>you can discern the wheat from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaff,</v>

27
00:01:15.981 --> 00:01:17.330
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

28
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.370
<v Speaker 1>and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing that I was thinking</v>

29
00:01:26.591 --> 00:01:29.890
<v Speaker 1>about it's worth consideration too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>

30
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe this is,</v>

31
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.290
<v Speaker 1>maybe this is petty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think it is.</v>
