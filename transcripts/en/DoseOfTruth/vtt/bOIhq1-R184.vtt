00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.273
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

2
00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.620
<v Speaker 2>let's get rid of the fixes.</v>

3
00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:04.630
<v Speaker 2>I Ita,</v>

4
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.850
<v Speaker 2>so sometimes he listed it as a lack of,</v>

5
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.760
<v Speaker 2>as you apply critical thinking language.</v>

6
00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.720
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like it's like a mathematical problem and the logic association with</v>

7
00:00:13.721 --> 00:00:14.680
<v Speaker 2>contribution of herbs,</v>

8
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.810
<v Speaker 2>I feel sometimes they're locking and this is basic knowledge and kind of put two</v>

9
00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:20.644
<v Speaker 2>and two together.</v>

10
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.131
<v Speaker 1>The best way,</v>

11
00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:26.250
<v Speaker 1>the best way to teach people critical thinking is to teach them to write.</v>

12
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:27.651
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

13
00:00:27.651 --> 00:00:29.500
<v Speaker 1>I made this little thing that I put online.</v>

14
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.353
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

15
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if maybe it is it in the site for 34 website.</v>

16
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.000
<v Speaker 1>Did I post that rubric for Essay Writing?</v>

17
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.500
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it actually went through.</v>

18
00:00:37.501 --> 00:00:39.700
<v Speaker 3>I think it is still on four 30</v>

19
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.300
<v Speaker 1>is it not on four 34 is that not working?</v>

20
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.290
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

21
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.123
<v Speaker 3>When you were doing it.</v>

22
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.443
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

23
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.921
<v Speaker 3>I bet.</v>

24
00:00:45.921 --> 00:00:46.151
<v Speaker 3>I bet.</v>

25
00:00:46.151 --> 00:00:46.960
<v Speaker 3>I still found it.</v>

26
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.150
<v Speaker 3>It's still in corporate before 30</v>

27
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:49.011
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

28
00:00:49.011 --> 00:00:49.610
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

29
00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:50.600
<v Speaker 1>Well there's an essay.</v>

30
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:51.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh that's too bad.</v>

31
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.080
<v Speaker 1>It's not on the site for 34 website even I didn't cause I updated it anyways.</v>

32
00:00:57.081 --> 00:00:58.380
<v Speaker 1>I have this guide to writing.</v>

33
00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.130
<v Speaker 1>It's that if it isn't on the four 34 website,</v>

34
00:01:01.131 --> 00:01:03.350
<v Speaker 1>it is definitely on the four 30 website.</v>

35
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:04.663
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

36
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.870
<v Speaker 1>it steps people through the process of writing because what's happened now,</v>

37
00:01:08.871 --> 00:01:11.510
<v Speaker 1>it's very hard to teach people to write because it's unbelievably time</v>

38
00:01:11.511 --> 00:01:12.344
<v Speaker 1>intensive.</v>

39
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.220
<v Speaker 1>And like writing marketing a good essay that's really easy.</v>

40
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:17.360
<v Speaker 1>Check a,</v>

41
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:18.890
<v Speaker 1>you did everything right,</v>

42
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:19.340
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

43
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.710
<v Speaker 1>Marking a bad essay.</v>

44
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:21.650
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

45
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:22.611
<v Speaker 1>the words are wrong.</v>

46
00:01:22.611 --> 00:01:23.421
<v Speaker 1>The phrases are wrong,</v>

47
00:01:23.421 --> 00:01:24.260
<v Speaker 1>the sentences are wrong.</v>

48
00:01:24.261 --> 00:01:25.880
<v Speaker 1>They're not ordered right in the paragraphs.</v>

49
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.820
<v Speaker 1>The paragraphs aren't coherent and the whole thing makes no sense.</v>

50
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.270
<v Speaker 1>So trying to tell the person what they did wrong,</v>

51
00:01:32.271 --> 00:01:32.601
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

52
00:01:32.601 --> 00:01:32.811
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

53
00:01:32.811 --> 00:01:33.800
<v Speaker 1>you did everything wrong.</v>

54
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.600
<v Speaker 1>Everything about this essay is wrong.</v>

55
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.030
<v Speaker 1>Well that's not helpful either.</v>

56
00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:38.864
<v Speaker 1>You have to</v>

57
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.920
<v Speaker 1>find the few little things they did half right and you have to teach them what</v>

58
00:01:43.921 --> 00:01:44.700
<v Speaker 1>they did wrong.</v>

59
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.260
<v Speaker 1>It's really expensive.</v>

60
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.540
<v Speaker 1>And so what I did with this rubric was try to address that from the production</v>

61
00:01:51.541 --> 00:01:53.010
<v Speaker 1>side instead of the grading side.</v>

62
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.460
<v Speaker 1>But the best thing you can do is teach people to write because there's no</v>

63
00:01:56.461 --> 00:01:57.840
<v Speaker 1>difference between that and thinking.</v>

64
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.030
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that just blows me away about universities is that no one</v>

65
00:02:03.031 --> 00:02:05.490
<v Speaker 1>ever tell students why they should write something.</v>

66
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:06.271
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

67
00:02:06.271 --> 00:02:06.421
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

68
00:02:06.421 --> 00:02:09.990
<v Speaker 1>you have to do this assignment well why are you writing while you need the</v>

69
00:02:09.991 --> 00:02:10.380
<v Speaker 1>grade?</v>

70
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.651
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

71
00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:11.484
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

72
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.950
<v Speaker 1>you need to learn to think because thinking makes you act effectively in the</v>

73
00:02:16.951 --> 00:02:17.340
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

74
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.610
<v Speaker 1>Thinking makes you win the battles you undertake and those could be battles for</v>

75
00:02:20.611 --> 00:02:21.390
<v Speaker 1>good things.</v>

76
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.190
<v Speaker 1>If you can think and speak and right,</v>

77
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.130
<v Speaker 1>you are absolutely deadly.</v>

78
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.020
<v Speaker 1>Nothing can get in your way.</v>

79
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.000
<v Speaker 1>So that's why you learned to write.</v>

80
00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:32.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like why don't,</v>

81
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.160
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe that people aren't just told that it's,</v>

82
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.481
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

83
00:02:35.481 --> 00:02:36.314
<v Speaker 1>it's like</v>

84
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.150
<v Speaker 1>it's the most powerful weapon you could possibly provide someone with and I mean</v>

85
00:02:42.151 --> 00:02:45.690
<v Speaker 1>I know lots of people who've been staggeringly successful and watch them</v>

86
00:02:45.691 --> 00:02:46.441
<v Speaker 1>throughout my life.</v>

87
00:02:46.441 --> 00:02:47.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean those people,</v>

88
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.230
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to have an argument with them.</v>

89
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.370
<v Speaker 1>They'll just slash you into pieces and not in a malevolent way.</v>

90
00:02:53.371 --> 00:02:56.520
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you're going to make your point in there and to make their point,</v>

91
00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.730
<v Speaker 1>you better have your points organized because otherwise you are going to look</v>

92
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.330
<v Speaker 1>like and be an absolute idiot.</v>

93
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.160
<v Speaker 1>You are not going to get anywhere.</v>

94
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.510
<v Speaker 1>And if you can formulate your arguments coherently and make a presentation,</v>

95
00:03:10.511 --> 00:03:11.770
<v Speaker 1>if you can speak to people,</v>

96
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.750
<v Speaker 1>if you can lay out a proposal,</v>

97
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.441
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

98
00:03:14.441 --> 00:03:15.550
<v Speaker 1>people give you money,</v>

99
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:16.930
<v Speaker 1>they give you opportunities,</v>

100
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.820
<v Speaker 1>you have influence.</v>

101
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.370
<v Speaker 1>That's what you were at university for.</v>

102
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.570
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what you do is you urinate Irin English right here and yeah,</v>

103
00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:26.730
<v Speaker 1>new languages anyways.</v>

104
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:27.161
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

105
00:03:27.161 --> 00:03:27.994
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

106
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.390
<v Speaker 1>teach,</v>

107
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.220
<v Speaker 1>teach people to be articulate because that's the most dangerous thing you can</v>

108
00:03:33.221 --> 00:03:34.120
<v Speaker 1>possibly be.</v>

109
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.351
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

110
00:03:35.351 --> 00:03:36.370
<v Speaker 1>and that's motivating.</v>

111
00:03:36.371 --> 00:03:37.270
<v Speaker 1>If people know that,</v>

112
00:03:37.271 --> 00:03:37.600
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

113
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.310
<v Speaker 1>well why are you learning to write?</v>

114
00:03:39.311 --> 00:03:40.120
<v Speaker 1>Because your,</v>

115
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.020
<v Speaker 1>here's your sword,</v>

116
00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:42.820
<v Speaker 1>here's your m 16 right?</v>

117
00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:44.410
<v Speaker 1>Here's your bulletproof vest.</v>

118
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.600
<v Speaker 1>I like you're learning how to use them,</v>

119
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.143
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

120
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:52.613
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>

121
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.700
<v Speaker 1>it's an endless mystery to me why that isn't made self evident.</v>

122
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.770
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

123
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.500
<v Speaker 1>that's the sort of thing that can drive you mad trying to sort out.</v>

124
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like people are,</v>

125
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.811
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

126
00:04:06.811 --> 00:04:10.470
<v Speaker 1>there's a conspiracy to bring people into the education system to make them</v>

127
00:04:10.471 --> 00:04:11.304
<v Speaker 1>weaker.</v>

128
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.953
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

129
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:15.940
<v Speaker 1>I guess that keeps the competition down.</v>

130
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.140
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's one way of thinking about it.</v>

131
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:21.520
<v Speaker 1>If your students are stupid,</v>

132
00:04:21.521 --> 00:04:22.660
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to challenge you.</v>

133
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.750
<v Speaker 4>So other questions,</v>

134
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.360
<v Speaker 1>disagreements,</v>

135
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a pretty harsh indictment of the university system</v>

136
00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.350
<v Speaker 2>when you were talking about marriage.</v>

137
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:38.453
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

138
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.470
<v Speaker 2>you get to play points</v>

139
00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.440
<v Speaker 2>if you stay,</v>

140
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:44.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

141
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.190
<v Speaker 2>which is of course a really good point.</v>

142
00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.390
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

143
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.180
<v Speaker 2>you have more possibilities to them towards a solution.</v>

144
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:52.293
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

145
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.233
<v Speaker 2>But that is also,</v>

146
00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.780
<v Speaker 2>it's also assume that you will always get a solution.</v>

147
00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.791
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

148
00:04:59.791 --> 00:05:00.624
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>

149
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:03.443
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

150
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:04.380
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

151
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:04.870
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

152
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:05.140
<v Speaker 2>Hello.</v>

153
00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.120
<v Speaker 2>What a solution that will keep the marriage</v>

154
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.551
<v Speaker 1>true?</v>

155
00:05:08.551 --> 00:05:08.731
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

156
00:05:08.731 --> 00:05:08.971
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

157
00:05:08.971 --> 00:05:09.810
<v Speaker 1>there used to be,</v>

158
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.880
<v Speaker 1>before the divorce laws were really liberalized,</v>

159
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.910
<v Speaker 1>there wa there you could sue for irreconcilable differences and sometimes people</v>

160
00:05:16.951 --> 00:05:18.720
<v Speaker 1>do find themselves in that situation.</v>

161
00:05:18.721 --> 00:05:23.190
<v Speaker 1>It's like one person wants children and the other person doesn't like that's a</v>

162
00:05:23.191 --> 00:05:24.024
<v Speaker 1>tough one.</v>

163
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.650
<v Speaker 1>It's a tough one to negotiate.</v>

164
00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.600
<v Speaker 1>So I'm,</v>

165
00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm certainly not saying that just because you lock yourself into a like two</v>

166
00:05:33.481 --> 00:05:34.410
<v Speaker 1>cats in a barrel,</v>

167
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:39.240
<v Speaker 1>that that will make you solve your problems because problems are hard to solve</v>

168
00:05:39.241 --> 00:05:40.620
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes you can't solve them.</v>

169
00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.410
<v Speaker 1>I was just pointing out what the cost of,</v>

170
00:05:43.411 --> 00:05:44.970
<v Speaker 1>of leaving the back door,</v>

171
00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.220
<v Speaker 1>what the cost of leaving the back door open is.</v>

172
00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.340
<v Speaker 1>And it's a big cost and a,</v>

173
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.621
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

174
00:05:49.621 --> 00:05:53.700
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I see too is that people's identities fragment increasingly</v>

175
00:05:53.701 --> 00:05:54.534
<v Speaker 1>across time.</v>

176
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:55.320
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

177
00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.320
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that you have as you age is something like the continuity of</v>

178
00:06:00.981 --> 00:06:01.814
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>

179
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.830
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

180
00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:03.180
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

181
00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.700
<v Speaker 1>you have someone that you're with,</v>

182
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:06.620
<v Speaker 1>you've tied your story together with theirs,</v>

183
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:08.140
<v Speaker 1>you have children,</v>

184
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.230
<v Speaker 1>maybe they have children.</v>

185
00:06:09.231 --> 00:06:12.680
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's this continual pay off,</v>

186
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.740
<v Speaker 1>so to speak in quality that you obtained from staying within that frame.</v>

187
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:21.860
<v Speaker 1>And you can jump out of that.</v>

188
00:06:21.861 --> 00:06:24.290
<v Speaker 1>And I suppose to some degree that that provides freedom,</v>

189
00:06:24.291 --> 00:06:26.240
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't obvious to me that it does that for sure.</v>

190
00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:27.173
<v Speaker 2>People</v>

191
00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.230
<v Speaker 2>once this relationship,</v>

192
00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.120
<v Speaker 2>it's a my blood email.</v>

193
00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:35.991
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

194
00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:36.350
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

195
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.800
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

196
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.820
<v Speaker 1>but it's also the case that sequential relationships are unlikely to be that.</v>

197
00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:42.803
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

198
00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:44.050
<v Speaker 1>So look,</v>

199
00:06:44.051 --> 00:06:44.330
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

200
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:45.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

201
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:45.671
<v Speaker 1>I'm not making,</v>

202
00:06:45.671 --> 00:06:48.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm definitely not making a utopian case for marriage.</v>

203
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.070
<v Speaker 2>I would like to hear the case where it was from you because they make it really</v>

204
00:06:55.071 --> 00:06:55.671
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

205
00:06:55.671 --> 00:06:55.941
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

206
00:06:55.941 --> 00:06:57.170
<v Speaker 2>It says talk point,</v>

207
00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:58.400
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time,</v>

208
00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.170
<v Speaker 2>I think there are some relationships that are waking Oh,</v>

209
00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:02.870
<v Speaker 2>quality.</v>

210
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:03.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

211
00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:04.280
<v Speaker 2>And if we,</v>

212
00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.500
<v Speaker 2>if that's the case,</v>

213
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.910
<v Speaker 2>then insisting is on the,</v>

214
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

215
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:11.983
<v Speaker 2>cannot be good.</v>

216
00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:12.341
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

217
00:07:12.341 --> 00:07:12.791
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>

218
00:07:12.791 --> 00:07:14.770
<v Speaker 1>that's definitely the alternative argument.</v>

219
00:07:14.771 --> 00:07:18.490
<v Speaker 1>And of course there are strong things to be said on both sides,</v>

220
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:19.953
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

221
00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:27.490
<v Speaker 1>see there's some,</v>

222
00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.850
<v Speaker 1>there's some additional problems with divorce that people don't really grasp</v>

223
00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:32.493
<v Speaker 1>when they're young.</v>

224
00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.980
<v Speaker 1>Like the idea that you can be divorced once you have children,</v>

225
00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.800
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of a stupid idea because you can't,</v>

226
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.233
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

227
00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.073
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

228
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:46.200
<v Speaker 1>you can find a limited substitute for your initial freedom.</v>

229
00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.310
<v Speaker 1>But if you,</v>

230
00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:50.350
<v Speaker 1>if you have kids and you try to get divorced,</v>

231
00:07:50.351 --> 00:07:53.140
<v Speaker 1>the probability that that's going to demolish your life is very,</v>

232
00:07:53.141 --> 00:07:53.974
<v Speaker 1>very high.</v>

233
00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:54.971
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

234
00:07:54.971 --> 00:07:56.530
<v Speaker 1>it's incredibly expensive.</v>

235
00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:01.450
<v Speaker 1>So one or both of you is going to come out of that poor and</v>

236
00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:05.140
<v Speaker 1>your market value has declined.</v>

237
00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:07.510
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you're the woman who takes the kids.</v>

238
00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:10.300
<v Speaker 1>Your market value has declined radically.</v>

239
00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:11.680
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be poorer.</v>

240
00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:13.293
<v Speaker 1>The man,</v>

241
00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:18.250
<v Speaker 1>he's just a screwed because he is now an indentured servant and there's no</v>

242
00:08:18.251 --> 00:08:19.084
<v Speaker 1>escape from it.</v>

243
00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:21.220
<v Speaker 1>So it's an,</v>

244
00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:25.270
<v Speaker 1>it's not so bad if you can negotiate a peaceful separation and some people can,</v>

245
00:08:25.271 --> 00:08:27.820
<v Speaker 1>but lots of times if you have a terrible relationship,</v>

246
00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.280
<v Speaker 1>it's not like negotiating a peaceful separation.</v>

247
00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:31.180
<v Speaker 1>It's all that easy.</v>

248
00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:33.370
<v Speaker 1>But if you're at each other's throats,</v>

249
00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:34.750
<v Speaker 1>good luck to you.</v>

250
00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.410
<v Speaker 1>I think it's roughly equivalent to having nonfatal cancer.</v>

251
00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:40.540
<v Speaker 1>It is not pleasant.</v>

252
00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:42.220
<v Speaker 1>It's a 10 year process,</v>

253
00:08:42.221 --> 00:08:43.240
<v Speaker 1>15 year process.</v>

254
00:08:43.241 --> 00:08:48.241
<v Speaker 1>It'll cost you $250,000 and it'll tear a big chunk out of your life and also it</v>

255
00:08:48.731 --> 00:08:52.750
<v Speaker 1>will really disrupt your relationship with your kids and you know,</v>

256
00:08:52.751 --> 00:08:55.030
<v Speaker 1>you bring kids into a step parent family,</v>

257
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:56.430
<v Speaker 1>they do not do as well.</v>

258
00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.810
<v Speaker 1>Step parents are not as good parents as biological parents and the data on that</v>

259
00:09:00.811 --> 00:09:01.380
<v Speaker 1>is clear.</v>

260
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:01.650
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

261
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:05.670
<v Speaker 1>obviously there are exceptions because there are terrible biological parents and</v>

262
00:09:05.671 --> 00:09:07.230
<v Speaker 1>there are wonderful step parents.</v>

263
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:08.790
<v Speaker 1>But if you look in aggregate,</v>

264
00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:11.400
<v Speaker 1>it's not that easy to care for children.</v>

265
00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:16.280
<v Speaker 1>You need to everything you can binding you to them.</v>

266
00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.380
<v Speaker 1>And if there's someone else's children,</v>

267
00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:22.670
<v Speaker 1>mostly they get in the way of the person that you love.</v>

268
00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:24.783
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

269
00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:25.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

270
00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:26.630
<v Speaker 1>if I'm,</v>

271
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:27.800
<v Speaker 1>let's say you have a child,</v>

272
00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:29.173
<v Speaker 1>I'll be right out.</v>

273
00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.610
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you have a child and I want to go out with you</v>

274
00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.150
<v Speaker 1>every second you spend with that child is a second.</v>

275
00:09:35.151 --> 00:09:37.370
<v Speaker 1>You don't spend it with me and,</v>

276
00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:38.750
<v Speaker 1>and there's gonna be a price for that.</v>

277
00:09:38.751 --> 00:09:40.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to be happy about that.</v>

278
00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:40.730
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

279
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:41.870
<v Speaker 1>and if I have a child,</v>

280
00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:43.550
<v Speaker 1>you're going to feel exactly the same way.</v>

281
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:44.151
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>

282
00:09:44.151 --> 00:09:44.331
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

283
00:09:44.331 --> 00:09:44.511
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

284
00:09:44.511 --> 00:09:45.201
<v Speaker 1>I love children.</v>

285
00:09:45.201 --> 00:09:45.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

286
00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:45.981
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

287
00:09:45.981 --> 00:09:46.520
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

288
00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:47.353
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>

289
00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:48.643
<v Speaker 1>sure you do.</v>

290
00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:51.500
<v Speaker 1>I doubted you might love your child.</v>

291
00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:52.620
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

292
00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:53.061
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

293
00:09:53.061 --> 00:09:55.280
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty specific the way that people loved children.</v>

294
00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:56.803
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

295
00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:01.310
<v Speaker 1>and the rate of abuse for kids in step parent families is way higher than it is</v>

296
00:10:01.311 --> 00:10:02.390
<v Speaker 1>in biological families.</v>

297
00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:03.830
<v Speaker 1>There's not even any comparison.</v>

298
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:06.830
<v Speaker 1>So anyways.</v>
