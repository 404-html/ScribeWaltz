1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.780
<v Speaker 1>You also felt that sort of embedded</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside the shower where the contract</v>

2
00:00:03.781 --> 00:00:07.890
<v Speaker 1>sexual tendencies and so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you see people who are well</v>

3
00:00:07.891 --> 00:00:09.690
<v Speaker 1>developed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men let say,</v>

4
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.090
<v Speaker 1>and we can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can also talk about women in this</v>

5
00:00:12.091 --> 00:00:15.150
<v Speaker 1>regard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men who've integrated their shadow often</v>

6
00:00:15.151 --> 00:00:19.710
<v Speaker 1>also develop a kind of peculiar grace</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be a consequence of not only</v>

7
00:00:19.711 --> 00:00:22.860
<v Speaker 1>allowing their aggressive side to step</v>
<v Speaker 1>forward,</v>

8
00:00:22.861 --> 00:00:26.010
<v Speaker 1>but also their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their feminine and in Compassionate side</v>

9
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.110
<v Speaker 1>that might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they may have kept squelched</v>

10
00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:30.900
<v Speaker 1>because of embarrassment about it or</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they'd been harassed for being</v>

11
00:00:30.901 --> 00:00:33.030
<v Speaker 1>weak or any number of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

12
00:00:33.031 --> 00:00:35.520
<v Speaker 1>but the practical approach for</v>
<v Speaker 1>developing your shadow,</v>

13
00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:40.521
<v Speaker 1>I would say is to contemplate and</v>
<v Speaker 1>consider your resentment and notice what</v>

14
00:00:40.861 --> 00:00:44.640
<v Speaker 1>it says and because your resentment will</v>
<v Speaker 1>also tell you what you have to say.</v>

15
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.740
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so look,</v>

16
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.330
<v Speaker 1>look at what happened at Google this</v>
<v Speaker 1>weekend.</v>

17
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>James Damore wrote that memo and you can</v>

18
00:00:50.701 --> 00:00:55.080
<v Speaker 1>imagine he was pretty angry and perhaps</v>
<v Speaker 1>even somewhat resentful at having to</v>

19
00:00:55.081 --> 00:00:57.810
<v Speaker 1>attend that diversity seminar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm really just using this as an</v>

20
00:00:57.811 --> 00:01:01.890
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what he did was decide that that</v>

21
00:01:01.891 --> 00:01:05.310
<v Speaker 1>meant that he had something that he had</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say and then look at the consequences</v>

22
00:01:05.311 --> 00:01:07.710
<v Speaker 1>of that man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an absolutely unbelievable.</v>

23
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.440
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're feeling oppressed at work or</v>

24
00:01:10.441 --> 00:01:13.310
<v Speaker 1>you're oppressed in your life or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you know where you're oppressing</v>

25
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.810
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you got to notice that you're</v>

26
00:01:15.811 --> 00:01:17.580
<v Speaker 1>feeling oppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you have to notice that you're</v>

27
00:01:17.581 --> 00:01:21.120
<v Speaker 1>feeling resentful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resentful and angry and bitter,</v>

28
00:01:21.121 --> 00:01:24.850
<v Speaker 1>and maybe even like Cain in the story of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cain and Abel because Cain is sort of</v>

29
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.200
<v Speaker 1>the archetypal bitter man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to decide what it is</v>

30
00:01:28.201 --> 00:01:31.560
<v Speaker 1>that you need to do in order to remove</v>
<v Speaker 1>from yourself that bitterness.</v>

31
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.650
<v Speaker 1>And that's usually means that there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that you have to say and then</v>

32
00:01:34.651 --> 00:01:37.050
<v Speaker 1>you have to say it because you're sold</v>
<v Speaker 1>depends on it.</v>

33
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.030
<v Speaker 1>And not only does your soul depend on</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

34
00:01:39.031 --> 00:01:42.570
<v Speaker 1>I would say the fate of the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>depends on it because you know you might</v>

35
00:01:42.571 --> 00:01:45.090
<v Speaker 1>be wrong and then you should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>straightened out.</v>

36
00:01:45.091 --> 00:01:47.790
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're just being whiny and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to talk to somebody about that.</v>

37
00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:50.880
<v Speaker 1>But it may be that you're actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>detecting something wrong,</v>

38
00:01:50.881 --> 00:01:53.640
<v Speaker 1>some tyranny that's directed towards you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and other people,</v>

39
00:01:53.641 --> 00:01:56.490
<v Speaker 1>and it's like your moral obligation to</v>
<v Speaker 1>speak up about it.</v>

40
00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.120
<v Speaker 1>And so many workplaces become toxic to</v>
<v Speaker 1>use a terrible cliche,</v>

41
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.350
<v Speaker 1>cliche because the people in the won't</v>
<v Speaker 1>speak up for what they actually want,</v>

42
00:02:04.351 --> 00:02:07.920
<v Speaker 1>or they speak up too late and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all twisted up about it and,</v>

43
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.340
<v Speaker 1>and you know they're torturing other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people because they're so unhappy and so</v>

44
00:02:11.341 --> 00:02:15.330
<v Speaker 1>forth and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So practical approach for developing</v>

45
00:02:15.331 --> 00:02:20.280
<v Speaker 1>your shadow fundamentally is radical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honesty and young said that in a genuine</v>

46
00:02:20.281 --> 00:02:22.800
<v Speaker 1>moral effort was a good substitute for</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy.</v>
