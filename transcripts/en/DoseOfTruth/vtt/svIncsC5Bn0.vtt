00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.270
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think,</v>

2
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:09.103
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:10.201
<v Speaker 1>there's cars,</v>

4
00:00:10.201 --> 00:00:13.230
<v Speaker 1>there's a kind of a contradictory narrative that runs through that story,</v>

5
00:00:13.231 --> 00:00:14.064
<v Speaker 1>which is that,</v>

6
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.281
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7
00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:14.580
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

8
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.121
<v Speaker 1>you're a kid,</v>

9
00:00:15.121 --> 00:00:16.170
<v Speaker 1>you were sort of isolated,</v>

10
00:00:16.171 --> 00:00:16.831
<v Speaker 1>you were bookish,</v>

11
00:00:16.831 --> 00:00:18.900
<v Speaker 1>she were more scientifically oriented,</v>

12
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.190
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time you obviously had a,</v>

13
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:22.610
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

14
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:23.431
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it,</v>

15
00:00:23.431 --> 00:00:27.330
<v Speaker 1>a a feel for ecstatic experience and like was that,</v>

16
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.350
<v Speaker 1>was that a consequence of your participation in the counterculture in the 60s or</v>

17
00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:33.540
<v Speaker 1>was that something that emerged even before that?</v>

18
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.570
<v Speaker 1>It was suddenly an emerge probably between the age of 10 and 12 it probably came</v>

19
00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:41.360
<v Speaker 1>from the fact that I was suffering serious social deprivation.</v>

20
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:42.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm really,</v>

21
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.560
<v Speaker 1>I had one friend at a time and that's about as much as I had and I was,</v>

22
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.090
<v Speaker 1>I was an indispensable figure when it came time to beat somebody up because I</v>

23
00:00:51.091 --> 00:00:51.924
<v Speaker 1>was the target.</v>

24
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.003
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

25
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.620
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

26
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:53.861
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>

27
00:00:53.861 --> 00:00:54.221
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

28
00:00:54.221 --> 00:00:56.020
<v Speaker 1>So That's interesting too because that also,</v>

29
00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean it isn't obvious how you get from that position to being interested in</v>

30
00:01:01.271 --> 00:01:03.310
<v Speaker 1>ecstatic experiences per se.</v>

31
00:01:03.311 --> 00:01:04.021
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>

32
00:01:04.021 --> 00:01:07.450
<v Speaker 1>what's the connection there with your rather like what would you call it?</v>

33
00:01:07.451 --> 00:01:09.310
<v Speaker 1>Isolated childhood experiences,</v>

34
00:01:09.311 --> 00:01:10.030
<v Speaker 1>do you think?</v>

35
00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean you said it had something partly to do with music,</v>

36
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.200
<v Speaker 1>which makes a perfect,</v>

37
00:01:14.201 --> 00:01:16.870
<v Speaker 1>perfect sense to me because music has almost a,</v>

38
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.891
<v Speaker 1>what would you say?</v>

39
00:01:17.891 --> 00:01:22.891
<v Speaker 1>It's an unerring gateway into that ecstatic experience for for very complex</v>

40
00:01:22.931 --> 00:01:23.550
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>

41
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.090
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to talk to you about that a little bit,</v>

42
00:01:25.091 --> 00:01:26.600
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>

43
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.100
<v Speaker 1>it isn't obvious why someone who was more scientifically oriented say would also</v>

44
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.090
<v Speaker 1>make that leap over to the more mystical end of things and then of course pursue</v>

45
00:01:36.091 --> 00:01:36.901
<v Speaker 1>it through pop culture.</v>

46
00:01:36.901 --> 00:01:37.734
<v Speaker 1>So you laid out,</v>

47
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.760
<v Speaker 1>you're surprising involvement,</v>

49
00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.140
<v Speaker 1>literary magazine,</v>

50
00:01:41.141 --> 00:01:45.430
<v Speaker 1>your transformation of that into what was essentially an visual art publication,</v>

51
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.790
<v Speaker 1>your entry into the world radio and then into rock.</v>

52
00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to lose that thread because that also leads to your PR firm and I</v>

53
00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:53.650
<v Speaker 1>presume we're getting to that,</v>

54
00:01:53.651 --> 00:01:55.680
<v Speaker 1>but what he can,</v>

55
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.750
<v Speaker 1>is there anything you can put your finger on you,</v>

56
00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.260
<v Speaker 1>you associated it also with like being physically bullied and being a social</v>

57
00:02:02.261 --> 00:02:02.711
<v Speaker 1>outcast,</v>

58
00:02:02.711 --> 00:02:05.110
<v Speaker 1>but why did that give you that hunger for that experience,</v>

59
00:02:05.111 --> 00:02:06.550
<v Speaker 1>for that ecstatic experience?</v>

60
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.951
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

61
00:02:06.951 --> 00:02:09.440
<v Speaker 1>remember back to the days of the 1960 [inaudible],</v>

62
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.450
<v Speaker 1>the 1970s one sleep deprivation was a new discovery and then back in the 1990s</v>

63
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.860
<v Speaker 1>and early two thousands Jaak Panksepp took that a step further.</v>

64
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.190
<v Speaker 1>And in his studies of rat behavior,</v>

65
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.440
<v Speaker 1>he discovered that if he deprived a bunch of child rats,</v>

66
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.150
<v Speaker 1>little rats,</v>

67
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.983
<v Speaker 1>baby rats,</v>

68
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.570
<v Speaker 1>if he deprives them of the ability to play.</v>

69
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

70
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.240
<v Speaker 1>And didn't give them access to each other as peers until they,</v>

71
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.520
<v Speaker 1>they become adults.</v>

72
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.110
<v Speaker 1>They suffered play deprivation and they spent just as much time playing with</v>

73
00:02:40.111 --> 00:02:44.200
<v Speaker 1>each other as adults as they would have spent playing with each other.</v>

74
00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.010
<v Speaker 1>Have they been allowed to as children?</v>

75
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.480
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

76
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.340
<v Speaker 1>So I want to make a quick lateral move there and we'll get back to that.</v>

77
00:02:50.341 --> 00:02:50.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

78
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.350
<v Speaker 1>I've been thinking about these,</v>

79
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.740
<v Speaker 1>these strange modern manifestations of identity fantasy or that's what it looks</v>

80
00:02:58.011 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 1>to me like these people are playing out.</v>

81
00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

82
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.201
<v Speaker 1>what do they call them,</v>

83
00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:06.160
<v Speaker 1>other kids and playing with their identities in a really fantasy based way.</v>

84
00:03:06.161 --> 00:03:10.270
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes I wonder if part of that isn't a consequence of play deprivation</v>

85
00:03:10.271 --> 00:03:11.104
<v Speaker 1>in childhood.</v>

86
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.251
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

87
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:13.000
<v Speaker 1>that sounds,</v>

88
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.671
<v Speaker 1>that sounds like it.</v>

89
00:03:13.671 --> 00:03:14.710
<v Speaker 1>The same possibility.</v>

90
00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:19.711
<v Speaker 1>But remember Herman has said that there is somewhere deep dark in the mind.</v>

91
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.870
<v Speaker 1>There's a closet with 10,000 hidden personalities.</v>

92
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.790
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I discovered,</v>

93
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.740
<v Speaker 1>we're going to get out of chronological order,</v>

94
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.730
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things that I discovered when I first became full time involved</v>

95
00:03:30.731 --> 00:03:33.280
<v Speaker 1>with rock and roll was the story of Alice Cooper.</v>

96
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.210
<v Speaker 1>And the story of Alice Cooper reveals something about the question that you just</v>

97
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:38.020
<v Speaker 1>raised.</v>

98
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.853
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

99
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.040
<v Speaker 1>Alice Cooper was a little bit like me when he was a kid.</v>

100
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.340
<v Speaker 1>His mom used to dress up in a suit every day and he was a gawky then with a huge</v>

101
00:03:47.741 --> 00:03:48.574
<v Speaker 1>nose.</v>

102
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:49.270
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

103
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.010
<v Speaker 1>I was lucky fin with a huge nose.</v>

104
00:03:51.011 --> 00:03:51.821
<v Speaker 1>I can identify.</v>

105
00:03:51.821 --> 00:03:52.870
<v Speaker 1>I never wore suits though.</v>

106
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.300
<v Speaker 1>And he was always a teacher's pet.</v>

107
00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.400
<v Speaker 1>And the result was the other kids hated him and he was kicked around and beaten</v>

108
00:04:00.401 --> 00:04:00.761
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

109
00:04:00.761 --> 00:04:03.640
<v Speaker 1>and excluded the way that I'd been kicked around and beaten,</v>

110
00:04:03.641 --> 00:04:04.474
<v Speaker 1>then excluded.</v>

111
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.780
<v Speaker 1>Then one day a neighbor was at in his kitchen who was into a weegee board and</v>

112
00:04:10.331 --> 00:04:12.760
<v Speaker 1>making contact with spirits through the weegie board.</v>

113
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.013
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

114
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.530
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

115
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.591
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

116
00:04:14.591 --> 00:04:18.100
<v Speaker 1>spirit allegedly contacted her and said,</v>

117
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.190
<v Speaker 1>I am the ghost of a witch who was burned of the say in the 16th century and,</v>

118
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.000
<v Speaker 1>or 17th century.</v>

119
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.480
<v Speaker 1>And you pointing to Alice,</v>

120
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm pointing to his thing was rinse for an ea at the time,</v>

121
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.830
<v Speaker 1>pointing into Vince,</v>

122
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.850
<v Speaker 1>you are my modern reincarnation and my name is Alice Cooper.</v>

123
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.830
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

124
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.160
<v Speaker 1>Now when,</v>

125
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.380
<v Speaker 1>when Vince for an ea one onstage and address with Mascara at a high school</v>

126
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.910
<v Speaker 1>talent night for the very first time playing his own music,</v>

127
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.130
<v Speaker 1>chopping up baby dolls with an ax,</v>

128
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.950
<v Speaker 1>which is the more real person,</v>

129
00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.220
<v Speaker 1>Vince for NEA,</v>

130
00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.330
<v Speaker 1>the shy little kid dressed up in a suit who gave apples to his teacher or Alice</v>

131
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.941
<v Speaker 1>Cooper,</v>

132
00:05:03.941 --> 00:05:07.630
<v Speaker 1>the person on stage who comes to life with an ecstatic identity that makes them</v>

133
00:05:07.631 --> 00:05:10.570
<v Speaker 1>a surfer on the back of those mass passions,</v>

134
00:05:10.571 --> 00:05:13.690
<v Speaker 1>those mass exhilaration that make the forces of history.</v>

135
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.261
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

136
00:05:14.261 --> 00:05:15.310
<v Speaker 1>Alice of the two,</v>

137
00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.040
<v Speaker 1>they're both real people and they're both inside events for an ea,</v>

138
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.740
<v Speaker 1>but the one that's in there that has a greatest passionate intensity is the</v>

139
00:05:23.741 --> 00:05:24.574
<v Speaker 1>Alice Cooper,</v>

140
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.050
<v Speaker 1>not the Vince for an NEA.</v>

141
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.760
<v Speaker 1>And that's why though he had been picked on and none of the kids in his school</v>

142
00:05:30.761 --> 00:05:31.594
<v Speaker 1>had liked him.</v>

143
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.060
<v Speaker 1>The minute he finished his first performance,</v>

144
00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.940
<v Speaker 1>all the football guys who used to beat the crap out of him,</v>

145
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.710
<v Speaker 1>surge down to the foot of the stage and volunteered to be parts of his band.</v>

146
00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.973
<v Speaker 1>And when he,</v>

147
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.260
<v Speaker 1>when he was super famous,</v>

148
00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.640
<v Speaker 1>some of those guys were still mainstays of his band.</v>

149
00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.640
<v Speaker 1>We carry many selves inside of us.</v>

150
00:05:51.641 --> 00:05:51.751
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

151
00:05:51.751 --> 00:05:56.751
<v Speaker 1>my job in PR was to find people who deserve to be iconic and then to explain to</v>

152
00:05:59.001 --> 00:05:59.211
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

153
00:05:59.211 --> 00:06:00.044
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

154
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.093
<v Speaker 1>I will not,</v>

155
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.550
<v Speaker 1>if you think that I as your publicist,</v>

156
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to fashion an artificial mask and image and through that make you a</v>

157
00:06:07.641 --> 00:06:08.090
<v Speaker 1>star.</v>

158
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:12.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get you an appointment with my best competitor immediately you'll</v>

159
00:06:12.141 --> 00:06:13.070
<v Speaker 1>be whether I'm an hours,</v>

160
00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:14.240
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

161
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.290
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to work with me,</v>

162
00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:16.760
<v Speaker 1>you will have to understand something.</v>

163
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.710
<v Speaker 1>The music you make is about human soul that comes from the very soul of you and</v>

164
00:06:21.711 --> 00:06:25.730
<v Speaker 1>what happens to you when you go out on stage and feel as if to yourself leaves</v>

165
00:06:25.731 --> 00:06:29.270
<v Speaker 1>you and you are a dance like a puppet or like a puppet on a string,</v>

166
00:06:29.271 --> 00:06:31.400
<v Speaker 1>like a marionette on stage.</v>

167
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.170
<v Speaker 1>The force that moves you,</v>

168
00:06:33.171 --> 00:06:36.450
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the gods inside of you that is your soul and what you're</v>

169
00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.230
<v Speaker 1>experiencing with that audience is a soul exchange.</v>

170
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.740
<v Speaker 1>If you're willing to put up with the fact that music is not about marketing,</v>

171
00:06:42.741 --> 00:06:44.120
<v Speaker 1>music is not about product.</v>

172
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.220
<v Speaker 1>Music is not about downloads,</v>

173
00:06:46.221 --> 00:06:48.980
<v Speaker 1>music is about these chains are human soul,</v>

174
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.330
<v Speaker 1>then I will work with you.</v>

175
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:55.080
<v Speaker 1>And quite the statement for a Zionist is to yes,</v>

176
00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:57.530
<v Speaker 1>they talk really is all in that manner.</v>

177
00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:57.850
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

178
00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:58.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

179
00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.091
<v Speaker 1>I listen,</v>

180
00:06:59.091 --> 00:07:03.410
<v Speaker 1>tell us Cooper a lot when I was a kid and still now especially that record a</v>

181
00:07:03.411 --> 00:07:04.520
<v Speaker 1>welcome to my nightmare,</v>

182
00:07:04.521 --> 00:07:06.320
<v Speaker 1>which I think is an absolute classic.</v>

183
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:06.741
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

184
00:07:06.741 --> 00:07:08.270
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple of pop songs on it,</v>

185
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:08.870
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

186
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:09.703
<v Speaker 1>which I think,</v>

187
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean record companies did that a fair bit on,</v>

188
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:13.850
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

189
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.260
<v Speaker 1>on concept albums.</v>

190
00:07:15.261 --> 00:07:15.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

191
00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:16.940
<v Speaker 1>they'd throw a pop hint on there,</v>

192
00:07:16.941 --> 00:07:18.620
<v Speaker 1>but right as a concept album,</v>

193
00:07:18.621 --> 00:07:21.800
<v Speaker 1>it's brilliant and it's really well arranged and it's really</v>

194
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.150
<v Speaker 1>not horrifying.</v>

195
00:07:26.151 --> 00:07:28.430
<v Speaker 1>Exactly because that's not exactly right,</v>

196
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:30.380
<v Speaker 1>but it's unbelievably dramatic.</v>

197
00:07:30.381 --> 00:07:33.140
<v Speaker 1>I would say theatrical in in the best way.</v>

198
00:07:33.141 --> 00:07:36.470
<v Speaker 1>And I really think it's a work of genius that welcome to my nightmare.</v>

199
00:07:36.471 --> 00:07:37.304
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

200
00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:37.851
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

201
00:07:37.851 --> 00:07:38.930
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea that,</v>

202
00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:40.460
<v Speaker 1>that that was Alice Cooper's background,</v>

203
00:07:40.461 --> 00:07:43.250
<v Speaker 1>although I did hear that he was the child of a minister.</v>

204
00:07:43.251 --> 00:07:44.180
<v Speaker 1>Is that also correct?</v>

205
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:44.370
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

206
00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:44.631
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

207
00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:44.841
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

208
00:07:44.841 --> 00:07:45.141
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

209
00:07:45.141 --> 00:07:47.930
<v Speaker 1>His father was in the aerospace industry in Arizona.</v>

210
00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.190
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

211
00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:50.660
<v Speaker 1>big aerospace territory.</v>

212
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:51.990
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

213
00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:55.730
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of the kids who were turned on to Alice Cooper and were turned down by</v>

214
00:07:55.731 --> 00:07:58.940
<v Speaker 1>other shark bands like that were the children of,</v>

215
00:07:58.980 --> 00:07:59.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

216
00:07:59.600 --> 00:07:59.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

217
00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:00.680
<v Speaker 1>ministers,</v>

218
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.870
<v Speaker 1>the children of deeply religious people,</v>

219
00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:04.460
<v Speaker 1>the religious right.</v>

220
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.290
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

221
00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:07.460
<v Speaker 1>because he's bringing out the other side of things.</v>

222
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:07.641
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

223
00:08:07.641 --> 00:08:08.090
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

224
00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:08.923
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

225
00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:10.380
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

226
00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:10.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

227
00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.850
<v Speaker 1>he's obviously the precursor of people like Marilyn Manson.</v>

228
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:14.511
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

229
00:08:14.511 --> 00:08:15.201
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

230
00:08:15.201 --> 00:08:16.910
<v Speaker 1>A Marilyn Manson was to sort of cheap,</v>

231
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:19.310
<v Speaker 1>even though Marilyn Manson was kind enough to be good.</v>

232
00:08:19.311 --> 00:08:19.970
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>

233
00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:21.650
<v Speaker 1>Marilyn Manson was a kind of cheap,</v>

234
00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:22.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

235
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.193
<v Speaker 1>take off.</v>

236
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:26.780
<v Speaker 1>And Alice Cooper didn't have the staying power that Alice seems to have had.</v>
