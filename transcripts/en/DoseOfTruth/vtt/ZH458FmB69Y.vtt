1
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.380
<v Speaker 1>So this is the idea.</v>

2
00:00:04.381 --> 00:00:05.011
<v Speaker 1>Essentially,</v>

3
00:00:05.011 --> 00:00:09.630
<v Speaker 1>you know that you have the unknown world that that's just what you don't know at</v>

4
00:00:09.631 --> 00:00:10.140
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

5
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.440
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

6
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.580
<v Speaker 1>that's the outside,</v>

7
00:00:11.581 --> 00:00:13.530
<v Speaker 1>that's the ocean that surrounds the island,</v>

8
00:00:13.531 --> 00:00:15.090
<v Speaker 1>that you inhabit something like that.</v>

9
00:00:15.091 --> 00:00:20.091
<v Speaker 1>It's chaos itself and then you act in that world and you act in ways you don't</v>

10
00:00:20.581 --> 00:00:21.241
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

11
00:00:21.241 --> 00:00:22.740
<v Speaker 1>There's more to your actions.</v>

12
00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:23.910
<v Speaker 1>Then you can understand.</v>

13
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.380
<v Speaker 1>One of the things young said,</v>

14
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.041
<v Speaker 1>I love this.</v>

15
00:00:26.041 --> 00:00:27.150
<v Speaker 1>When I first understood it,</v>

16
00:00:27.151 --> 00:00:27.660
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

17
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.190
<v Speaker 1>everybody acts out a myth,</v>

18
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.150
<v Speaker 1>but very few people know what their myth is and you should know what your myth</v>

19
00:00:33.151 --> 00:00:37.290
<v Speaker 1>is because it might be a tragedy and maybe you don't want it to be,</v>

20
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.930
<v Speaker 1>and that's really worth thinking because thinking about,</v>

21
00:00:39.931 --> 00:00:40.650
<v Speaker 1>because you're,</v>

22
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.270
<v Speaker 1>you have a pattern of behavior that characterizes you,</v>

23
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:00:43.651 --> 00:00:45.660
<v Speaker 1>and God only knows where you got it.</v>

25
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.280
<v Speaker 1>Partly it's biological,</v>

26
00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:48.610
<v Speaker 1>partly it's from your parents.</v>

27
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.960
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

28
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.520
<v Speaker 1>it's your unconscious assumptions.</v>

29
00:00:50.521 --> 00:00:53.640
<v Speaker 1>It's the way the philosophy of your society is shaped you and it's,</v>

30
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.840
<v Speaker 1>it's aimed,</v>

31
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.700
<v Speaker 1>it's aiming you somewhere.</v>

32
00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.601
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

33
00:00:57.601 --> 00:00:59.700
<v Speaker 1>is it aiming you somewhere you want to go?</v>

34
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.930
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>

35
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.820
<v Speaker 1>That's part of self realization.</v>

36
00:01:02.821 --> 00:01:03.630
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

37
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.000
<v Speaker 1>we know we don't understand our actions.</v>

38
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.630
<v Speaker 1>That's an almost every argument you have with someone is about that.</v>

39
00:01:09.631 --> 00:01:10.230
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

40
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.950
<v Speaker 1>why did you do that and come up with some half baked reasons why you did it.</v>

41
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.050
<v Speaker 1>You're flailing around in the darkness.</v>

42
00:01:16.051 --> 00:01:16.291
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

43
00:01:16.291 --> 00:01:18.000
<v Speaker 1>you try to give an account for yourself,</v>

44
00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:19.770
<v Speaker 1>but you can only do it partially.</v>

45
00:01:19.771 --> 00:01:20.161
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

46
00:01:20.161 --> 00:01:23.090
<v Speaker 1>very difficult because you're in your,</v>

47
00:01:23.091 --> 00:01:27.600
<v Speaker 1>you're a complicated animal with the beginnings of an articulated mind,</v>

48
00:01:27.601 --> 00:01:28.650
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

49
00:01:28.651 --> 00:01:30.840
<v Speaker 1>and you're just way more than you can handle.</v>
