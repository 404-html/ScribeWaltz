1
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.433
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

2
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:13.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

3
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:18.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm really kind of hoping that at least 30% of you will be severely unhappy with</v>

4
00:00:19.091 --> 00:00:19.924
<v Speaker 1>this lecture.</v>

5
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.460
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

6
00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.880
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

7
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:22.810
<v Speaker 1>and maybe that's wrong,</v>

8
00:00:22.811 --> 00:00:24.100
<v Speaker 1>I'll find out afterwards.</v>

9
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:25.780
<v Speaker 1>This is a very,</v>

10
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.330
<v Speaker 1>this dimension of personality.</v>

11
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.200
<v Speaker 1>Agreeableness is one of the dimensions that most particularly differentiate men</v>

12
00:00:35.621 --> 00:00:40.621
<v Speaker 1>and women and obviously the differences or similarities between men and women is</v>

13
00:00:46.091 --> 00:00:49.780
<v Speaker 1>a matter of hot debate in our society.</v>

14
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:51.753
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

15
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.833
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

16
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.210
<v Speaker 1>and I want it run through the science that's associated with that.</v>

17
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:00.303
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

18
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:04.161
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

19
00:01:04.161 --> 00:01:05.240
<v Speaker 1>I guess then we'll see what,</v>

20
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.200
<v Speaker 1>what we conclude.</v>

21
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.273
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

22
00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.720
<v Speaker 1>you remember that the big five were derived from a statistical analysis of the</v>

23
00:01:13.721 --> 00:01:14.890
<v Speaker 1>content of language.</v>

24
00:01:14.891 --> 00:01:15.724
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

25
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.790
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of interesting because it means that in so far as any psychological</v>

26
00:01:21.731 --> 00:01:26.731
<v Speaker 1>theory in the history of psychology has been a theoretical with the possible</v>

27
00:01:27.401 --> 00:01:29.170
<v Speaker 1>exception of intelligence,</v>

28
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.980
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

29
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:30.730
<v Speaker 1>research,</v>

30
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.180
<v Speaker 1>which was also the Iq is also derived statistically,</v>

31
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:35.703
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

32
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.320
<v Speaker 1>it was derived by golden or it was initially theorized by golden in some sense</v>

33
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:42.970
<v Speaker 1>back in the late 18 hundreds.</v>

34
00:01:42.971 --> 00:01:47.971
<v Speaker 1>But what Golden Thought of as Eminence bears very little relationship to what</v>

35
00:01:49.001 --> 00:01:49.990
<v Speaker 1>the psychometric,</v>

36
00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.890
<v Speaker 1>what the psychometricians measure as intelligence.</v>

37
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.950
<v Speaker 1>So intelligence is a statistical construct or Iq is a statistical construct and</v>

38
00:01:59.381 --> 00:02:02.140
<v Speaker 1>the big five traits are statistical constructs.</v>

39
00:02:02.141 --> 00:02:04.120
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that</v>

40
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.310
<v Speaker 1>there are theoretical presumptions that went into their derivation,</v>

41
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.600
<v Speaker 1>but it's very difficult to think of them as political because the first</v>

42
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.300
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis was only that</v>

43
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.190
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental dimensions of personality would be reflected in the language</v>

44
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.721
<v Speaker 1>English to begin with.</v>

45
00:02:26.721 --> 00:02:30.290
<v Speaker 1>But then other languages as the research progressed around the world,</v>

46
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.590
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult for me to understand that as a political theory.</v>

47
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.341
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

48
00:02:34.341 --> 00:02:38.300
<v Speaker 1>Cause if scientific findings have political implications,</v>

49
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.600
<v Speaker 1>then you have to wonder if the biases of the researchers put the political</v>

50
00:02:43.851 --> 00:02:47.270
<v Speaker 1>implications into the data before revealing them is data.</v>

51
00:02:47.271 --> 00:02:48.680
<v Speaker 1>But it's very difficult to argue that.</v>

52
00:02:48.681 --> 00:02:50.780
<v Speaker 1>I think with regards to trait theories,</v>

53
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.090
<v Speaker 1>the other thing that happened with trait theories is that the statistical</v>

54
00:02:56.091 --> 00:02:59.000
<v Speaker 1>analysis suggested their existence.</v>

55
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.410
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't until after the traits were reasonably well identified.</v>

56
00:03:03.411 --> 00:03:08.411
<v Speaker 1>And this really started to kick in in the 90s that we started to under stand the</v>

57
00:03:09.671 --> 00:03:11.440
<v Speaker 1>potential biological basis.</v>

58
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:11.551
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

59
00:03:11.551 --> 00:03:12.790
<v Speaker 1>and even the nature,</v>

60
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.800
<v Speaker 1>the descriptive nature of the traits at the aspect level now where you</v>

61
00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:19.870
<v Speaker 1>differentiate the big five into 10,</v>

62
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.530
<v Speaker 1>there's still aspects that we don't know much about.</v>

63
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:24.030
<v Speaker 1>We don't know,</v>

64
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.370
<v Speaker 1>like we don't really understand the difference between politeness and</v>

65
00:03:27.371 --> 00:03:28.204
<v Speaker 1>compassion.</v>

66
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.360
<v Speaker 1>We know that liberals are more compassionate than,</v>

67
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.680
<v Speaker 1>than conservatives.</v>

68
00:03:32.681 --> 00:03:35.110
<v Speaker 1>And conservatives are more polite than liberals.</v>

69
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.040
<v Speaker 1>And we think that politeness is somehow associated with the tendency of</v>

70
00:03:39.041 --> 00:03:41.650
<v Speaker 1>conservatives to follow social rules.</v>

71
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.690
<v Speaker 1>But that's about,</v>

72
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.690
<v Speaker 1>I would say that's about all we know now.</v>

73
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.320
<v Speaker 1>We don't even know how much difference there will turn out to be between polite</v>

74
00:03:50.321 --> 00:03:51.640
<v Speaker 1>politeness and compassion.</v>

75
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.360
<v Speaker 1>But were there are ongoing studies trying to understand the covariates and</v>

76
00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:01.900
<v Speaker 1>correlates of the aspects.</v>

77
00:04:01.901 --> 00:04:03.580
<v Speaker 1>And the same is true of the traits.</v>

78
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.003
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

79
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.380
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of argument about openness when it first was discovered</v>

80
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:12.280
<v Speaker 1>statistically.</v>

81
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:17.410
<v Speaker 1>Some people like Hans Isaac who formulated some of the early three dimensional</v>

82
00:04:17.411 --> 00:04:19.570
<v Speaker 1>models of personality and that was extroversion,</v>

83
00:04:19.571 --> 00:04:21.910
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism and psychotic racism,</v>

84
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.690
<v Speaker 1>which he thought would predict the proclivity towards schizophrenia but actually</v>

85
00:04:25.691 --> 00:04:30.250
<v Speaker 1>turned out to be composed of low agreeableness and low conscientiousness.</v>

86
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.340
<v Speaker 1>Isaac didn't even think that openness was a reasonable trait.</v>

87
00:04:33.341 --> 00:04:35.770
<v Speaker 1>He thought it was mostly captured by Iq.</v>

88
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.090
<v Speaker 1>And actually that seems to be the case to some degree because if you divide</v>

89
00:04:40.091 --> 00:04:43.210
<v Speaker 1>openness into intellect and into openness to experience,</v>

90
00:04:43.211 --> 00:04:48.211
<v Speaker 1>it looks like Iq loads on intellect or at least the nonverbal part of Iq loads</v>

91
00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:53.410
<v Speaker 1>on intellect where the verbal part of Iq tends to load more on openness and</v>

92
00:04:53.411 --> 00:04:54.100
<v Speaker 1>sodas,</v>

93
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.110
<v Speaker 1>openness to experience and so does creativity.</v>

94
00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.630
<v Speaker 1>But this is all discovered after the fact.</v>

95
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:04.530
<v Speaker 1>So now one of the things that's happened as a consequence of parsing out</v>

96
00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:10.861
<v Speaker 1>personality into the big five traits and also using other traits schemas is that</v>

97
00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.450
<v Speaker 1>it's quite clear that there are differences between the sexes or if you like</v>

98
00:05:16.451 --> 00:05:18.100
<v Speaker 1>differences between the genders.</v>

99
00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.970
<v Speaker 1>Now this is a thorny problem and it's thorny for a number of reasons.</v>

100
00:05:24.191 --> 00:05:29.191
<v Speaker 1>One reason is that it's a dogmatic assumption proposition of social</v>

101
00:05:31.151 --> 00:05:36.151
<v Speaker 1>constructionists that gender differences are socially constructed.</v>

102
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:38.231
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

103
00:05:38.231 --> 00:05:40.090
<v Speaker 1>they separate out the idea of sex,</v>

104
00:05:40.091 --> 00:05:43.600
<v Speaker 1>which you could think of as bio biological sex you could think of is chromosomal</v>

105
00:05:43.601 --> 00:05:43.961
<v Speaker 1>sex.</v>

106
00:05:43.961 --> 00:05:46.810
<v Speaker 1>I presume that's one thing,</v>

107
00:05:46.811 --> 00:05:47.710
<v Speaker 1>but gender,</v>

108
00:05:47.711 --> 00:05:51.340
<v Speaker 1>that's a whole different thing and gender is the manner in which men and women</v>

109
00:05:51.341 --> 00:05:55.090
<v Speaker 1>present themselves to the world in terms of differences in,</v>

110
00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:56.021
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

111
00:05:56.021 --> 00:06:00.500
<v Speaker 1>anything that you can measure that's above the fundamentally biological level.</v>

112
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.830
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you could say anything above the chromosomal difference.</v>

113
00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:04.120
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

114
00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't exactly know where the distinction is supposed to be made between</v>

115
00:06:07.731 --> 00:06:09.710
<v Speaker 1>biological sex and gender.</v>

116
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.840
<v Speaker 1>It's not a simple thing to understand,</v>

117
00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:17.410
<v Speaker 1>but the proposition still obtains that if there are differences between men and</v>

118
00:06:17.751 --> 00:06:22.550
<v Speaker 1>women at the level of phenotypic manifestation,</v>

119
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:24.380
<v Speaker 1>then they're socially constructed.</v>

120
00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:30.040
<v Speaker 1>The problem with that is that it seems to be wrong and not just a little bit</v>

121
00:06:30.111 --> 00:06:30.441
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>

122
00:06:30.441 --> 00:06:30.951
<v Speaker 1>but wrong,</v>

123
00:06:30.951 --> 00:06:32.030
<v Speaker 1>right to the core.</v>

124
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:37.570
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that I would like to propose to you is that the social</v>

125
00:06:38.421 --> 00:06:41.720
<v Speaker 1>constructionists only have theory on their side.</v>

126
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe they have any data to support their claims whatsoever.</v>

127
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:46.461
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

128
00:06:46.461 --> 00:06:49.520
<v Speaker 1>I also think that they wouldn't accept the sorts of things that I'm going to</v>

129
00:06:49.521 --> 00:06:51.140
<v Speaker 1>talk to you about as data,</v>

130
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.290
<v Speaker 1>but that's a whole different argument.</v>

131
00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:55.923
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

132
00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't really understand how it's possible for people in an,</v>

133
00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.360
<v Speaker 1>in the modern world to reject scientific claims given that almost everything</v>

134
00:07:06.401 --> 00:07:10.030
<v Speaker 1>they do in their day to day life that has anything to do with technology</v>

135
00:07:10.031 --> 00:07:10.900
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever,</v>

136
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:14.770
<v Speaker 1>depends for its function on the validity of the scientific theories that</v>

137
00:07:14.771 --> 00:07:16.120
<v Speaker 1>underpin the technology.</v>

138
00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:21.810
<v Speaker 1>So what that means is that people who treat scientific data as if it's just</v>

139
00:07:23.081 --> 00:07:24.700
<v Speaker 1>another form of information,</v>

140
00:07:24.701 --> 00:07:28.800
<v Speaker 1>socially constructed information certainly don't behave like that if you follow</v>

141
00:07:28.801 --> 00:07:30.400
<v Speaker 1>them around in the actual world.</v>

142
00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:35.940
<v Speaker 1>Now here is the proposition about agreeable.</v>

143
00:07:35.941 --> 00:07:36.181
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

144
00:07:36.181 --> 00:07:38.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if this is the case because as I said,</v>

145
00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:41.730
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of things we don't understand about the big five dimensions,</v>

146
00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:46.050
<v Speaker 1>but this is how I've worked it out for my own understanding and it's in</v>

147
00:07:46.051 --> 00:07:48.940
<v Speaker 1>accordance with the data in so far as I can determine that.</v>

148
00:07:48.941 --> 00:07:49.774
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

149
00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:55.420
<v Speaker 1>Agreeableness seems to be the dimension between,</v>

150
00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:58.840
<v Speaker 1>we certainly know agreeable people were empathic and compassionate and polite.</v>

151
00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.020
<v Speaker 1>We know less about disagreeable people,</v>

152
00:08:02.021 --> 00:08:04.060
<v Speaker 1>although we know that they're more likely to be male.</v>

153
00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:09.100
<v Speaker 1>Now you could associate being disagreeable with being more callous and more</v>

154
00:08:09.101 --> 00:08:14.101
<v Speaker 1>harsh and more selfish in that if you had to bargain with someone who's low in</v>

155
00:08:14.291 --> 00:08:15.124
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness,</v>

156
00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:19.000
<v Speaker 1>they would fight harder for their side of the equation than someone high in</v>

157
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:20.800
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness would fight for.</v>

158
00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:22.900
<v Speaker 1>There's now,</v>

159
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:28.510
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple of things about human beings that that aren't considered</v>

160
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:30.190
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently.</v>

161
00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:36.140
<v Speaker 1>I believe in so far as we conceptualize human personality and one is that humans</v>

162
00:08:37.361 --> 00:08:39.490
<v Speaker 1>are unbelievably maternal,</v>

163
00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.170
<v Speaker 1>both genders.</v>

164
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:46.980
<v Speaker 1>They have to be because our babies are born for a mammal of our size.</v>

165
00:08:47.261 --> 00:08:49.240
<v Speaker 1>That gestation period should be two years,</v>

166
00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:51.040
<v Speaker 1>not nine months,</v>

167
00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.620
<v Speaker 1>and so what that means is that babies,</v>

168
00:08:53.621 --> 00:08:58.410
<v Speaker 1>human babies are already born and you can tell that because you know like</v>

169
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:01.350
<v Speaker 1>ungulates deer,</v>

170
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:02.330
<v Speaker 1>think gears an ungulate,</v>

171
00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:03.253
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>

172
00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.250
<v Speaker 1>Pretty much as soon as they're born,</v>

173
00:09:05.251 --> 00:09:08.150
<v Speaker 1>they can stagger up on their legs and start to run around.</v>

174
00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:13.460
<v Speaker 1>Whereas a human baby isn't doing that till 15 months or 13 months or 17 months</v>

175
00:09:13.531 --> 00:09:14.640
<v Speaker 1>or depending on the baby,</v>

176
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:15.391
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

177
00:09:15.391 --> 00:09:16.050
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

178
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:19.860
<v Speaker 1>and babies are pretty much completely helpless at birth and so they need a</v>

179
00:09:19.861 --> 00:09:21.090
<v Speaker 1>tremendous amount of care.</v>

180
00:09:21.091 --> 00:09:25.710
<v Speaker 1>And then because we have such a large cortex and because we're so behaviorally</v>

181
00:09:25.711 --> 00:09:26.544
<v Speaker 1>plastic,</v>

182
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:29.610
<v Speaker 1>we have an extraordinarily long dependence and development period.</v>

183
00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:30.750
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

184
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:31.650
<v Speaker 1>it's a minimum,</v>

185
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:32.640
<v Speaker 1>it depends on the culture,</v>

186
00:09:32.641 --> 00:09:36.840
<v Speaker 1>but it's a minimum of 13 years and it can certainly extend far beyond that and</v>

187
00:09:36.841 --> 00:09:41.220
<v Speaker 1>does in cultures where there's a tremendous amount of inculcation of</v>

188
00:09:41.221 --> 00:09:42.054
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

189
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:48.080
<v Speaker 1>So we also know that maternal behavior is very common among mammals.</v>

190
00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:53.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean the very definition of mammal in some sense has to do with maternal</v>

191
00:09:53.401 --> 00:09:54.900
<v Speaker 1>behavior because mammals,</v>

192
00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.320
<v Speaker 1>well they bear live young and they produce milk with their warm blooded.</v>

193
00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:00.570
<v Speaker 1>There's some other characteristics.</v>

194
00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:01.763
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

195
00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.600
<v Speaker 1>so the ability to care for helpless</v>

196
00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:12.840
<v Speaker 1>frequently upset,</v>

197
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.180
<v Speaker 1>dependent</v>

198
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:21.540
<v Speaker 1>creatures for a very long period of time is part of our behavioral repertoire.</v>

199
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:22.950
<v Speaker 1>Now then you might wonder,</v>

200
00:10:22.951 --> 00:10:26.190
<v Speaker 1>are there individual differences in the degree to which people are maternal?</v>

201
00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.080
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's captured,</v>

202
00:10:28.081 --> 00:10:29.730
<v Speaker 1>at least in part with agreeableness,</v>

203
00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:33.720
<v Speaker 1>it makes sense because on the positive pole of agreeableness,</v>

204
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:38.430
<v Speaker 1>that's where you get warmth and compassion and empathy and a desire to care for</v>

205
00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.860
<v Speaker 1>others and and self sacrifice.</v>

206
00:10:40.861 --> 00:10:44.300
<v Speaker 1>I would say one of the things will will show later is the agreeable.</v>

207
00:10:44.301 --> 00:10:46.410
<v Speaker 1>This is negatively correlated with income,</v>

208
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:51.360
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what you'd expect if you were negotiating with someone who was</v>

209
00:10:51.361 --> 00:10:54.990
<v Speaker 1>self sacrificing because they're not going to put forward their side of the</v>

210
00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.680
<v Speaker 1>power equation as forcefully as someone who is disagreeable.</v>

211
00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:00.031
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

212
00:11:00.031 --> 00:11:00.541
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

213
00:11:00.541 --> 00:11:04.020
<v Speaker 1>in order to raise a baby you have to be self sacrificing.</v>

214
00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:05.760
<v Speaker 1>There is no two ways about it.</v>

215
00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:09.450
<v Speaker 1>You might find that rewarding and worthwhile,</v>

216
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:14.750
<v Speaker 1>but I don't believe there is a parent who actually becomes a good parent who</v>

217
00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:19.170
<v Speaker 1>doesn't put their child's welfare first.</v>

218
00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:22.440
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's particularly true of mothers,</v>

219
00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.260
<v Speaker 1>particularly in the first year after birth.</v>

220
00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:28.080
<v Speaker 1>It's probably true right up to the age of three,</v>

221
00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:32.490
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's virtually undeniably true for the first year.</v>

222
00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:34.570
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

223
00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:35.261
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>

224
00:11:35.261 --> 00:11:36.094
<v Speaker 1>is that</v>

225
00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:40.690
<v Speaker 1>reflected in personality traits?</v>

226
00:11:40.691 --> 00:11:41.230
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

227
00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:44.750
<v Speaker 1>the other thing about people that it's worthwhile recognizing is that</v>

228
00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:48.723
<v Speaker 1>we're hunters.</v>

229
00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:50.260
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

230
00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:54.820
<v Speaker 1>People aren't coniferous are pretty good at bringing down big game.</v>

231
00:11:56.770 --> 00:12:00.280
<v Speaker 1>It's reasonable to suppose that the reason that there aren't as many large</v>

232
00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:05.340
<v Speaker 1>animals in North America as there are in Africa is because when human beings</v>

233
00:12:06.581 --> 00:12:07.600
<v Speaker 1>came into North Africa,</v>

234
00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:08.411
<v Speaker 1>North America,</v>

235
00:12:08.411 --> 00:12:09.670
<v Speaker 1>15,000 years ago,</v>

236
00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:10.660
<v Speaker 1>they killed all of them.</v>

237
00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:12.910
<v Speaker 1>They killed all the mammoths,</v>

238
00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:14.680
<v Speaker 1>they killed all the giant bears,</v>

239
00:12:14.681 --> 00:12:15.940
<v Speaker 1>they killed all the cats,</v>

240
00:12:15.941 --> 00:12:16.780
<v Speaker 1>they killed all the,</v>

241
00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:18.490
<v Speaker 1>I think there were camels,</v>

242
00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:21.130
<v Speaker 1>maybe can't remember precisely.</v>

243
00:12:21.131 --> 00:12:21.551
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

244
00:12:21.551 --> 00:12:26.551
<v Speaker 1>there was a very large array of very large mammals and they started to disappear</v>

245
00:12:26.771 --> 00:12:31.771
<v Speaker 1>pretty damn quickly after the period of time where people migrated into North</v>

246
00:12:32.411 --> 00:12:32.800
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

247
00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:32.921
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

248
00:12:32.921 --> 00:12:36.010
<v Speaker 1>one of the theories is that in Africa,</v>

249
00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:41.130
<v Speaker 1>the animals and the people co evolved so that the animals and the people had</v>

250
00:12:41.771 --> 00:12:44.170
<v Speaker 1>fallen into some sort of mutual</v>

251
00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:46.683
<v Speaker 1>stability.</v>

252
00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:47.980
<v Speaker 1>But in North America,</v>

253
00:12:47.981 --> 00:12:49.360
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't the case at all.</v>

254
00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:50.531
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>

255
00:12:50.531 --> 00:12:53.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it was that easy to bring down a mammoth with a sphere.</v>

256
00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:58.420
<v Speaker 1>So it was very destructive of people to do what they did.</v>

257
00:12:58.421 --> 00:13:03.280
<v Speaker 1>But it also says volumes about what human beings are like.</v>

258
00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:08.540
<v Speaker 1>And it's certainly the case that a nontrivial proportion of the human population</v>

259
00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:10.600
<v Speaker 1>still hunts.</v>

260
00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.310
<v Speaker 1>And they'll do that for leisure,</v>

261
00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.160
<v Speaker 1>which is something that's very difficult for people who aren't countries to</v>

262
00:13:15.161 --> 00:13:15.994
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

263
00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:17.560
<v Speaker 1>And they're almost all men,</v>

264
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:20.350
<v Speaker 1>which I don't think will come as a surprise to anyone.</v>

265
00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:26.760
<v Speaker 1>So I think that predatory aggression is on the other side of agreeableness,</v>

266
00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:33.790
<v Speaker 1>and we also know that the best predictor of whether or not you're going to be in</v>

267
00:13:33.791 --> 00:13:36.520
<v Speaker 1>prison is low agreeableness.</v>

268
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:37.181
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

269
00:13:37.181 --> 00:13:39.130
<v Speaker 1>low conscientiousness also helps,</v>

270
00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:43.240
<v Speaker 1>but the fundamental marker of antisocial behavior in so far as it's captured by</v>

271
00:13:43.241 --> 00:13:46.450
<v Speaker 1>the big five personality markers seems to be low agreeableness.</v>

272
00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:48.010
<v Speaker 1>And that you might also say,</v>

273
00:13:48.011 --> 00:13:50.170
<v Speaker 1>given that men are less agreeable than women,</v>

274
00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:53.170
<v Speaker 1>that that's part of the reason why</v>

275
00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:57.100
<v Speaker 1>men are much more likely to be in prison than women.</v>

276
00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:59.040
<v Speaker 1>I think it's between,</v>

277
00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:01.570
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

278
00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:05.920
<v Speaker 1>I think it's 91% of incarcerated criminals are male,</v>

279
00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:10.150
<v Speaker 1>but I'm certain that it's above 80% I believe it's 91%.</v>
