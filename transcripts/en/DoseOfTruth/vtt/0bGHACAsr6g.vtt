<v Speaker 1>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Peterson.</v>

2
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what the story of Jacob today,</v>

3
00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:13.740
<v Speaker 1>there was a theme of betrayal and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can see that from the beginning because</v>

4
00:00:13.741 --> 00:00:15.570
<v Speaker 1>he was very angry and jealous of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>brother.</v>

5
00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.870
<v Speaker 1>And I was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are there any stories or we can say</v>

6
00:00:18.871 --> 00:00:21.120
<v Speaker 1>about betrayal that does come from a</v>
<v Speaker 1>loved one,</v>

7
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where it's not from a place of so black</v>

8
00:00:23.761 --> 00:00:26.220
<v Speaker 1>and white of anger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resentment and bitter,</v>

9
00:00:26.221 --> 00:00:28.550
<v Speaker 1>and how the parties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

10
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.570
<v Speaker 1>kind of recover from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or is there any way to reading dot.</v>

11
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.160
<v Speaker 1>Or is it as black and white us if you'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>be traced on one,</v>

12
00:00:34.161 --> 00:00:36.660
<v Speaker 1>then there it's like Jacob where he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was bitter.</v>

13
00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:37.300
<v Speaker 1>He was planning</v>

14
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.250
<v Speaker 2>hatred,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one.</v>

15
00:00:38.251 --> 00:00:39.730
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this story,</v>

16
00:00:39.731 --> 00:00:43.660
<v Speaker 2>it's not black and white because we know</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're only halfway through it.</v>

17
00:00:43.661 --> 00:00:44.620
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

18
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.830
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I've noticed as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>clinician,</v>

19
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.400
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that an,</v>

20
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.040
<v Speaker 2>as an observer of people in general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that I've never ever seen anyone get</v>

21
00:00:54.041 --> 00:00:57.220
<v Speaker 2>away with anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Jacob doesn't get away with any of</v>

22
00:00:57.221 --> 00:00:58.720
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

23
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.600
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

24
00:01:01.601 --> 00:01:06.601
<v Speaker 2>he's humbled by his eventual experiences</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he learns that he did it wrong.</v>

25
00:01:06.701 --> 00:01:10.300
<v Speaker 2>And there's reconciliation that happens</v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout the story of Jacob.</v>

26
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.680
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's minor betrayals and major be</v>

27
00:01:13.681 --> 00:01:14.411
<v Speaker 2>trails.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

28
00:01:14.411 --> 00:01:17.890
<v Speaker 2>that some of them have tremendously</v>
<v Speaker 2>serious consequences and some of them</v>

29
00:01:17.891 --> 00:01:21.670
<v Speaker 2>have lesser consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is an underlying idea that</v>

30
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.310
<v Speaker 2>things can still be set right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though it's,</v>

31
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.760
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it takes Jacob some 20 years,</v>

32
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.900
<v Speaker 2>something like that to set things right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even then,</v>

33
00:01:31.901 --> 00:01:36.190
<v Speaker 2>it's like touch and go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I answer your question,</v>

34
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.750
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
