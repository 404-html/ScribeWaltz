1
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.281
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2
00:00:07.281 --> 00:00:08.570
<v Speaker 1>Well those are big problems,</v>

3
00:00:08.571 --> 00:00:10.640
<v Speaker 1>especially the loss of unsupervised play.</v>

4
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:11.120
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

5
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.520
<v Speaker 1>it's not obvious at all how that might be addressed.</v>

6
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:14.300
<v Speaker 1>Yes it is.</v>

7
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:14.600
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

8
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.901
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

9
00:00:14.901 --> 00:00:15.734
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

10
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.730
<v Speaker 1>Everyone should just by Lenore skinnies,</v>

11
00:00:18.731 --> 00:00:23.450
<v Speaker 1>he's book free range kids and then they should loosen up and give their kids</v>

12
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.650
<v Speaker 1>more unsupervised time.</v>

13
00:00:24.651 --> 00:00:26.210
<v Speaker 1>Now you can't do this alone.</v>

14
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:27.590
<v Speaker 1>You'll be arrested.</v>

15
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.450
<v Speaker 1>I tried to get my son to go out across the street to buy groceries when he was</v>

16
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:34.670
<v Speaker 1>nine years old and he'd say liquid.</v>

17
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:35.121
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

18
00:00:35.121 --> 00:00:35.600
<v Speaker 1>Daddy,</v>

19
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.620
<v Speaker 1>people look at me funny there.</v>

20
00:00:36.621 --> 00:00:37.820
<v Speaker 1>There were no other kids out there.</v>

21
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.110
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

22
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.430
<v Speaker 1>and so Lenore has started a fantastic organization called let grow.</v>

23
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.790
<v Speaker 1>So if you were to go to let grow.org,</v>

24
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:47.030
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

25
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.740
<v Speaker 1>we'll put all this in the description,</v>

26
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:49.551
<v Speaker 1>all of these things,</v>

27
00:00:49.551 --> 00:00:49.790
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

28
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.440
<v Speaker 1>So I'm on the board of it as an advisor,</v>

29
00:00:51.441 --> 00:00:52.274
<v Speaker 1>Peter Gray,</v>

30
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.551
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

31
00:00:52.551 --> 00:00:53.211
<v Speaker 1>an expert on,</v>

32
00:00:53.211 --> 00:00:56.840
<v Speaker 1>on play is on the board and they're doing these simple things.</v>

33
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:57.381
<v Speaker 1>Simple,</v>

34
00:00:57.381 --> 00:01:02.381
<v Speaker 1>simple things like you convinced the school to just open up the playground an</v>

35
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.500
<v Speaker 1>hour early or keep it open after school.</v>

36
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.190
<v Speaker 1>Why should kids always have organized activities and soccer practice?</v>

37
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.460
<v Speaker 1>Just give them a place to play where there's a nurse available.</v>

38
00:01:13.461 --> 00:01:14.360
<v Speaker 1>If someone gets hurt,</v>

39
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.790
<v Speaker 1>there is an adult but he's not supervising.</v>

40
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.260
<v Speaker 1>He's just over there.</v>

41
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.030
<v Speaker 1>So don't worry parents,</v>

42
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.930
<v Speaker 1>there is an adult,</v>

43
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.090
<v Speaker 1>but beyond that do what they want.</v>

44
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.340
<v Speaker 1>And they just started this a few weeks ago.</v>

45
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.660
<v Speaker 1>The results are fantastic.</v>

46
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.460
<v Speaker 1>The kids are having so much fun,</v>

47
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.200
<v Speaker 1>they are becoming more independent,</v>

48
00:01:30.201 --> 00:01:32.570
<v Speaker 1>they're more willing to do projects on their own.</v>

49
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:33.740
<v Speaker 1>It's working out great.</v>

50
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.350
<v Speaker 1>So that's really good to do this on your own.</v>

51
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.050
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is we all know something's wrong.</v>

52
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.490
<v Speaker 1>So those are very practical.</v>

53
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.490
<v Speaker 1>That's very practical piece of advice for,</v>

54
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.401
<v Speaker 1>for schools.</v>

55
00:01:43.401 --> 00:01:47.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like open up the unsupervised play facilities and,</v>

56
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.230
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

57
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.730
<v Speaker 1>and facilitate their use.</v>

58
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:50.360
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

59
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.721
<v Speaker 1>Give,</v>

60
00:01:50.721 --> 00:01:52.280
<v Speaker 1>give everyone a place which is safe.</v>

61
00:01:52.281 --> 00:01:52.791
<v Speaker 1>And by safe,</v>

62
00:01:52.791 --> 00:01:53.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean physically safe.</v>

63
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.220
<v Speaker 1>Never use the word safety to describe emotions and ideas.</v>

64
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.140
<v Speaker 1>Safety means physical safety.</v>

65
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.780
<v Speaker 1>So you've got to provide a physically safe place for the kids to play.</v>

66
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.730
<v Speaker 1>And beyond that you let them go.</v>

67
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.950
<v Speaker 1>Now there will arise problems of bullying.</v>

68
00:02:06.951 --> 00:02:09.470
<v Speaker 1>So if it's repeated harassment,</v>

69
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:09.711
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

70
00:02:09.711 --> 00:02:10.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

71
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.630
<v Speaker 1>well I know a book about that,</v>

72
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.630
<v Speaker 1>which it's by Dan always called bullying,</v>

73
00:02:14.631 --> 00:02:16.250
<v Speaker 1>what we know and what we can do about it.</v>

74
00:02:16.251 --> 00:02:17.084
<v Speaker 1>And it was written,</v>

75
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.050
<v Speaker 1>it's got to be 30 years ago and always cut the rope,</v>

76
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.013
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

77
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.993
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

78
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.790
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

79
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.960
<v Speaker 1>the incidents of bullying in the Scandinavian countries down by 50%.</v>

80
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.190
<v Speaker 1>And he really,</v>

81
00:02:28.191 --> 00:02:30.470
<v Speaker 1>really targets what bullying means.</v>

82
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.740
<v Speaker 1>So he's not a safe space guy by any stretch of the imagination.</v>

83
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the origins of it are.</v>

84
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.920
<v Speaker 1>I know that valuations of his program in America show it anywhere from zero to</v>

85
00:02:39.921 --> 00:02:44.921
<v Speaker 1>20% reductions and the effects are much smaller in the u s in the u s yeah.</v>

86
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.110
<v Speaker 1>The question is whether or not they were able to implement them with the rigor</v>

87
00:02:48.111 --> 00:02:53.111
<v Speaker 1>he did in the u s but bullying programs are part of the problem because bullying</v>

88
00:02:53.121 --> 00:02:53.931
<v Speaker 1>clearly is a problem.</v>

89
00:02:53.931 --> 00:02:55.100
<v Speaker 1>We need to do something about it,</v>

90
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.230
<v Speaker 1>but because we have what's called concept creep.</v>

91
00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.941
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

92
00:02:57.941 --> 00:02:58.774
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

93
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.240
<v Speaker 1>so it's now back to your point,</v>

94
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.780
<v Speaker 1>concept creep looks like even,</v>

95
00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:02.230
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

96
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.063
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

97
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.610
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

98
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.310
<v Speaker 1>so now it's the case that if,</v>

99
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.200
<v Speaker 1>if kids don't invite,</v>

100
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.590
<v Speaker 1>if some kids want to do something and they don't invite another kid,</v>

101
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:12.760
<v Speaker 1>they've excluded that kid.</v>

102
00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:13.100
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

103
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.020
<v Speaker 1>Well that could be bullying.</v>

104
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.381
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

105
00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:18.400
<v Speaker 1>I've read of schools in Europe that don't allow kids to have best friends for</v>

106
00:03:18.401 --> 00:03:19.420
<v Speaker 1>exactly that reason.</v>

107
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

108
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.991
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

109
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:23.800
<v Speaker 1>because this is also something that really bothers me about the misuse of the</v>

110
00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:28.090
<v Speaker 1>IAT because it's not that easy to distinguish in group preference,</v>

111
00:03:28.091 --> 00:03:29.470
<v Speaker 1>which no one can,</v>

112
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.920
<v Speaker 1>no one went in their right mind would want to eliminate in group preference</v>

113
00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:37.480
<v Speaker 1>given that it governs your choice of mate and your behavior towards your family</v>

114
00:03:37.481 --> 00:03:37.841
<v Speaker 1>members,</v>

115
00:03:37.841 --> 00:03:38.674
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

116
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.240
<v Speaker 1>to distinguish that between outgroup exclusion is no in no simple matter.</v>

117
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.630
<v Speaker 1>And to tell kids that they can't have a best friend is another thing that</v>

118
00:03:46.631 --> 00:03:48.520
<v Speaker 1>interferes with an important part of their,</v>

119
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.250
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

120
00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

121
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.060
<v Speaker 1>I think both of us have spent a lot of time looking at ancient wisdom at,</v>

122
00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.220
<v Speaker 1>at the writings of,</v>

123
00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.140
<v Speaker 1>of people long ago.</v>

124
00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.800
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

125
00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.330
<v Speaker 1>and I often come back to Aristotle's claim that any virtue carried to extremes</v>

126
00:04:01.331 --> 00:04:02.380
<v Speaker 1>becomes advice.</v>

127
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.240
<v Speaker 1>So inclusion is a good thing if people are being excluded because they have a</v>

128
00:04:07.241 --> 00:04:08.980
<v Speaker 1>physical stigma or,</v>

129
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.920
<v Speaker 1>or they're overweight or their skin color.</v>

130
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.641
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

131
00:04:12.641 --> 00:04:13.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

132
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.090
<v Speaker 1>we need to be looking at the reasons why kids are excluded.</v>

133
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.510
<v Speaker 1>But if you say inclusion is the primary virtue,</v>

134
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.420
<v Speaker 1>inclusion over everything else.</v>

135
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.360
<v Speaker 1>And so if those two best friends are excluding others,</v>

136
00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.290
<v Speaker 1>no more best friends,</v>

137
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.550
<v Speaker 1>this is madness.</v>

138
00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:28.930
<v Speaker 1>This is a vice.</v>

139
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.550
<v Speaker 1>So I think that inclusion,</v>

140
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:31.420
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

141
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

142
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.630
<v Speaker 1>it's a virtue unless it's carried to extremes.</v>
