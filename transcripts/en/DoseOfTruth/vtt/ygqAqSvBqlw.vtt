00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.630
<v Speaker 1>Going to read something from [inaudible],</v>

2
00:00:07.631 --> 00:00:09.190
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the readings that you have,</v>

3
00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.460
<v Speaker 1>I should like even now to stress the fact that the psychopathology of the</v>

4
00:00:12.461 --> 00:00:14.410
<v Speaker 1>shamanic vocation is not profane.</v>

5
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.080
<v Speaker 1>It does not belong to ordinary symptomatology.</v>

6
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.080
<v Speaker 1>So what he's saying is that it's not psychopathological,</v>

7
00:00:20.081 --> 00:00:22.270
<v Speaker 1>it's part of normative personalities development.</v>

8
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.290
<v Speaker 1>It has an initiatory structure in significance and signification.</v>

9
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:27.161
<v Speaker 1>In short,</v>

10
00:00:27.161 --> 00:00:29.650
<v Speaker 1>it reproduces a traditional mystical pattern.</v>

11
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.910
<v Speaker 1>The total crisis of the future Sharman sometimes leading to complete</v>

12
00:00:33.911 --> 00:00:38.320
<v Speaker 1>disintegration of the personality and to madness can be evaluated not only as an</v>

13
00:00:38.321 --> 00:00:39.730
<v Speaker 1>initiatory death,</v>

14
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
<v Speaker 1>but also as a symbolic return to the pre cosmotronic chaos to the amorphous and</v>

15
00:00:45.191 --> 00:00:48.700
<v Speaker 1>indescribable state that precedes any cosmogony cause.</v>

16
00:00:48.701 --> 00:00:52.840
<v Speaker 1>Margariney is the account of the initial creation of being.</v>

17
00:00:52.841 --> 00:00:54.760
<v Speaker 1>So in the Judeo Christian tradition,</v>

18
00:00:54.761 --> 00:00:55.331
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

19
00:00:55.331 --> 00:00:58.930
<v Speaker 1>that would be the emergence of order out of the initial state of chaos.</v>

20
00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:59.510
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

21
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.270
<v Speaker 1>that's produced by God's word.</v>

22
00:01:01.271 --> 00:01:01.850
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

23
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.180
<v Speaker 1>and that's another symbolic representation.</v>

24
00:01:04.181 --> 00:01:05.140
<v Speaker 1>There's chaos,</v>

25
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.540
<v Speaker 1>there's the active word and there's order.</v>

26
00:01:07.541 --> 00:01:10.270
<v Speaker 1>And those are the three initial elements of being.</v>

27
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.860
<v Speaker 1>And so the Shaman in some senses reducing himself as a consequence of exposure</v>

28
00:01:14.861 --> 00:01:19.420
<v Speaker 1>to something radical to the initial components of his being and then being</v>

29
00:01:19.421 --> 00:01:20.770
<v Speaker 1>reconstructed out of that.</v>

30
00:01:20.771 --> 00:01:22.510
<v Speaker 1>And that happens to you all the time.</v>

31
00:01:22.511 --> 00:01:27.100
<v Speaker 1>In some sense when you encounter an obstacle that really sets you back because</v>

32
00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.060
<v Speaker 1>you know you've ordered the world and then what you find out is the ordering of</v>

33
00:01:31.061 --> 00:01:35.620
<v Speaker 1>the world is incorrect and before you can reorder it has to become chaotic.</v>

34
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.060
<v Speaker 1>It does become chaotic.</v>

35
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.680
<v Speaker 1>That's what sets you back.</v>

36
00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.820
<v Speaker 1>And then out of that chaos you have to bring out a new order if you can,</v>

37
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.601
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

38
00:01:43.601 --> 00:01:44.470
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

39
00:01:44.471 --> 00:01:46.240
<v Speaker 1>you get betrayed by someone that you love.</v>

40
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.571
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

41
00:01:46.571 --> 00:01:47.260
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

42
00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.560
<v Speaker 1>it's time to update your world model now can you?</v>

43
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.970
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe not,</v>

44
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.751
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

45
00:01:52.751 --> 00:01:54.760
<v Speaker 1>because if you really update it,</v>

46
00:01:54.761 --> 00:01:55.660
<v Speaker 1>you have to come.</v>

47
00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.710
<v Speaker 1>You have to come to terms with the fact that that individual,</v>

48
00:01:59.711 --> 00:02:01.090
<v Speaker 1>which would also include you,</v>

49
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.600
<v Speaker 1>is capable of radically immoral act because betrayal is a radically immoral,</v>

50
00:02:07.521 --> 00:02:08.111
<v Speaker 1>moral locked,</v>

51
00:02:08.111 --> 00:02:08.351
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

52
00:02:08.351 --> 00:02:10.840
<v Speaker 1>If there's any thing that's actually a moral,</v>

53
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.230
<v Speaker 1>it's people telling you one thing and then doing a whole bunch of other things</v>

54
00:02:14.231 --> 00:02:15.160
<v Speaker 1>behind your back.</v>

55
00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.260
<v Speaker 1>And then that brings up a question,</v>

56
00:02:17.261 --> 00:02:17.890
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

57
00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:18.011
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

58
00:02:18.011 --> 00:02:19.690
<v Speaker 1>how the hell can people be like that?</v>

59
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.790
<v Speaker 1>Especially because I'm also a person.</v>

60
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.480
<v Speaker 1>And then also how can I be so naive and moronic that that can happen to me?</v>

61
00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.561
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

62
00:02:26.561 --> 00:02:28.180
<v Speaker 1>and those are not trivial questions.</v>

63
00:02:28.181 --> 00:02:28.780
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

64
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:29.501
<v Speaker 1>if you can't,</v>

65
00:02:29.501 --> 00:02:31.780
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have an answer to them at hand,</v>

66
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.110
<v Speaker 1>what it means is that there's half the world you haven't mapped out,</v>

67
00:02:35.111 --> 00:02:36.460
<v Speaker 1>which would be the negative half.</v>

68
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.170
<v Speaker 1>And you may have to revisit and revise and destroy virtually all of your</v>

69
00:02:41.171 --> 00:02:42.490
<v Speaker 1>assumptions about the world.</v>

70
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.140
<v Speaker 1>So that's a reduction to chaos.</v>

71
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.520
<v Speaker 1>It is not fun,</v>

72
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.750
<v Speaker 1>especially if it happens accidentally and it can be traumatic enough so you</v>

73
00:02:49.751 --> 00:02:50.830
<v Speaker 1>never recover from it.</v>

74
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.200
<v Speaker 1>Post traumatic stress disorders like that.</v>

75
00:02:53.201 --> 00:02:56.230
<v Speaker 1>Like if you watch soldiers in battle and they get post traumatic stress</v>

76
00:02:56.231 --> 00:02:56.920
<v Speaker 1>disorder,</v>

77
00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.030
<v Speaker 1>it's very frequent that they get it because something they did not because of</v>

78
00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:02.200
<v Speaker 1>something that happened to them,</v>

79
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.801
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

80
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:06.490
<v Speaker 1>so they're out on a mission of some sort and they shoot a three year old child.</v>

81
00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:07.150
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

82
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.760
<v Speaker 1>and maybe they do it consciously and then,</v>

83
00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:09.941
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

84
00:03:09.941 --> 00:03:12.220
<v Speaker 1>they wake up after they do it and they think,</v>

85
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:13.780
<v Speaker 1>well that's not me.</v>

86
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:14.320
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

87
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.580
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes it is.</v>

88
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.880
<v Speaker 1>It's just not the you that you think you are and the you that did that man in</v>

89
00:03:21.191 --> 00:03:21.540
<v Speaker 1>countering,</v>

90
00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.800
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be enough to damage your consciousness.</v>

91
00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:26.440
<v Speaker 1>And that is what happened to people with post traumatic stress disorder.</v>

92
00:03:26.441 --> 00:03:30.790
<v Speaker 1>Like it blows them apart so badly and not just psychologically right.</v>

93
00:03:30.791 --> 00:03:31.120
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

94
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.140
<v Speaker 1>it radically alters them physiologically their amygdalas grow in their</v>

95
00:03:35.141 --> 00:03:36.400
<v Speaker 1>hippocampus by shrink.</v>

96
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.080
<v Speaker 1>If you have post traumatic stress disorder,</v>

97
00:03:38.081 --> 00:03:39.550
<v Speaker 1>it's a whole brain transformation.</v>

98
00:03:39.551 --> 00:03:41.440
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's no joke.</v>

99
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.380
<v Speaker 1>And the human capacity for evil is so deep that,</v>

100
00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:45.220
<v Speaker 1>well young,</v>

101
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.821
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

102
00:03:45.821 --> 00:03:47.080
<v Speaker 1>he thought that that uh,</v>

103
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.381
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

104
00:03:47.381 --> 00:03:49.130
<v Speaker 1>an accidental encounter with it.</v>

105
00:03:49.131 --> 00:03:53.350
<v Speaker 1>It was enough to well enough to lead to madness in some cases,</v>

106
00:03:53.351 --> 00:03:54.184
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

107
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:55.810
<v Speaker 1>it's no joke.</v>
