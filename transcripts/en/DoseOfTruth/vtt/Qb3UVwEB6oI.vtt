1
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.180
<v Speaker 1>Point is that I,</v>

2
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.320
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I told you,</v>

3
00:00:10.321 --> 00:00:11.550
<v Speaker 1>if you are going to be my client,</v>

4
00:00:11.551 --> 00:00:12.630
<v Speaker 1>as you just don't,</v>

5
00:00:12.631 --> 00:00:14.790
<v Speaker 1>you don't just tell your audience your assaults,</v>

6
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.800
<v Speaker 1>you owe your audience your life.</v>

7
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.230
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

8
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.230
<v Speaker 1>Jordan had helped me 20 years to articulate what I meant by that and it's simply</v>

9
00:00:22.491 --> 00:00:26.900
<v Speaker 1>that if deserve to be a superstar,</v>

10
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:28.183
<v Speaker 1>then you,</v>

11
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.290
<v Speaker 1>you will become an iconic figure.</v>

12
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.590
<v Speaker 1>And 12 year old kids will paste posters this view up on their bedroom walls and</v>

13
00:00:36.501 --> 00:00:37.071
<v Speaker 1>you will be,</v>

14
00:00:37.071 --> 00:00:37.341
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:00:37.341 --> 00:00:38.750
<v Speaker 1>the concept of the Trellis.</v>

16
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.760
<v Speaker 1>You wrote a tomato plant on a trellis.</v>

17
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.020
<v Speaker 1>Well you will be the trellis on which people row you will be the role model.</v>

18
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.710
<v Speaker 1>So your life is one of the most important things you have to offer.</v>

19
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.630
<v Speaker 1>But I wasn't just after their superficial life.</v>

20
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.510
<v Speaker 1>I was after I was after this.</v>

21
00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:57.600
<v Speaker 1>When you sit down,</v>

22
00:00:57.601 --> 00:00:57.930
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

23
00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:58.800
<v Speaker 1>of an afternoon,</v>

24
00:00:58.801 --> 00:01:01.620
<v Speaker 1>let's say at two o'clock in the afternoon with a blank computer screen or a</v>

25
00:01:01.621 --> 00:01:04.590
<v Speaker 1>blank piece of paper and you need to write a lyric.</v>

26
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.330
<v Speaker 1>You feel as if you could,</v>

27
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.940
<v Speaker 1>you don't know how you've ever written a lyric in your life.</v>

28
00:01:08.941 --> 00:01:11.280
<v Speaker 1>You certainly know you can't write another one again.</v>

29
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.480
<v Speaker 1>And by four o'clock in the afternoon,</v>

30
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:14.830
<v Speaker 1>on a good day,</v>

31
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.890
<v Speaker 1>there's a lyric in front of you like four o'clock in the afternoon.</v>

32
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.671
<v Speaker 1>A really,</v>

33
00:01:18.671 --> 00:01:20.740
<v Speaker 1>really rare good day.</v>

34
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.870
<v Speaker 1>That lyric is so perfect in itself,</v>

35
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.730
<v Speaker 1>but it feels like it wrote itself through you.</v>

36
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

37
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.040
<v Speaker 1>When you go on stage,</v>

38
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.200
<v Speaker 1>if you see the dog,</v>

39
00:01:29.201 --> 00:01:31.210
<v Speaker 1>the pupils of the audience dilating,</v>

40
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.430
<v Speaker 1>if you see their faces melting,</v>

41
00:01:33.431 --> 00:01:35.290
<v Speaker 1>losing individual characteristics.</v>

42
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.430
<v Speaker 1>If you see their energy fusing into a collective energy rather than just</v>

43
00:01:39.431 --> 00:01:40.540
<v Speaker 1>individual energies.</v>

44
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.210
<v Speaker 1>And if that collective force reaches,</v>

45
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

46
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:44.301
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

47
00:01:44.301 --> 00:01:48.730
<v Speaker 1>a pseudopod out to you and hooks into something inside of you that's bigger than</v>

48
00:01:48.731 --> 00:01:49.750
<v Speaker 1>yourself and again,</v>

49
00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.100
<v Speaker 1>you'll feel like an empty pipe and something inside you was transmogrifying all</v>

50
00:01:54.101 --> 00:01:57.070
<v Speaker 1>of this energy and flooding it back down to the audience.</v>

51
00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.280
<v Speaker 1>In a riverbed Vitori circuit and you have an out of body experience.</v>

52
00:02:00.281 --> 00:02:04.750
<v Speaker 1>You Watch yourself from the ceiling as you are dance that self inside of you,</v>

53
00:02:04.751 --> 00:02:06.400
<v Speaker 1>the dances you onstage,</v>

54
00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.290
<v Speaker 1>that is your fucking goddamn soul.</v>

55
00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.400
<v Speaker 1>And that's mark by and 10 to find.</v>

56
00:02:11.401 --> 00:02:13.860
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I intend to introduce you to.</v>

57
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.963
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

58
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.890
<v Speaker 1>Because you are about to become an icon.</v>

59
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.750
<v Speaker 1>And if you become an icon,</v>

60
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.930
<v Speaker 1>you have to be a force that takes hundreds of thousands or even tens of millions</v>

61
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.880
<v Speaker 1>of kids who feel lost in the world,</v>

62
00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.990
<v Speaker 1>who don't dare express their feelings because there are no except socially</v>

63
00:02:31.991 --> 00:02:35.350
<v Speaker 1>acceptable words for their feelings and who feel crazy,</v>

64
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.990
<v Speaker 1>isolated and alone.</v>

65
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.101
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>

66
00:02:38.101 --> 00:02:40.200
<v Speaker 1>by revealing what's deep inside of you,</v>

67
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.840
<v Speaker 1>will validate what's deep inside of them.</v>
