1
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.590
<v Speaker 1>Would you consider a more official</v>
<v Speaker 1>consultancy role with Andrew Scheer's</v>

2
00:00:10.591 --> 00:00:12.650
<v Speaker 1>Conservative Party?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.330
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to say what I would</v>
<v Speaker 1>consider.</v>

4
00:00:15.331 --> 00:00:20.310
<v Speaker 1>It isn't obvious to me that Andrew</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scheer would particularly like to have</v>

5
00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:23.180
<v Speaker 1>me as no official consultant time kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a,</v>

6
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.820
<v Speaker 1>what might you describe a controversial?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

7
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.130
<v Speaker 1>that's the word right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

8
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's funny though because I was making</v>

9
00:00:31.501 --> 00:00:34.620
<v Speaker 1>this new video today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I alluded to earlier,</v>

10
00:00:34.621 --> 00:00:38.850
<v Speaker 1>using good old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's this character here?</v>

11
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.120
<v Speaker 1>A Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Hitler,</v>

12
00:00:42.121 --> 00:00:44.140
<v Speaker 1>the spokes frog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

13
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.700
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went back and looked at my comments on</v>

14
00:00:47.701 --> 00:00:49.860
<v Speaker 1>bill [inaudible] last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

15
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.000
<v Speaker 1>which were the comments that originally</v>
<v Speaker 1>got me in hot water and had me accused</v>

16
00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:56.460
<v Speaker 1>of all the things I've been accused of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Transphobia,</v>

17
00:00:56.461 --> 00:00:57.960
<v Speaker 1>bigotry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>racism.</v>

18
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what else?</v>

19
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.750
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fascism being on the far right.</v>

20
00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:05.880
<v Speaker 1>And then finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to top it all off,</v>

21
00:01:05.881 --> 00:01:06.810
<v Speaker 1>Hitler himself.</v>

22
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.780
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that I realized</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that,</v>

23
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.540
<v Speaker 1>that I was really calm during that</v>
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>

24
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.350
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't have really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't have offered a more mild</v>

25
00:01:16.351 --> 00:01:18.670
<v Speaker 1>mannered criticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bill [inaudible].</v>

26
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.360
<v Speaker 1>And it's pretty funny because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

27
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm this scandal that engulfed Wilford</v>
<v Speaker 1>Laurey a this week is the worst scandal</v>

28
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.230
<v Speaker 1>that I remember involving a university</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

29
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.410
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my memory,</v>

30
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.440
<v Speaker 1>going back to the 19 seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what happened at Laurie was exactly</v>

31
00:01:37.201 --> 00:01:41.580
<v Speaker 1>what I predicted would happen except it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was actually worse because they did</v>

32
00:01:41.581 --> 00:01:46.581
<v Speaker 1>accuse Lynsay of breaking the law spill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see 16 specifically.</v>

33
00:01:47.281 --> 00:01:49.620
<v Speaker 1>And if contravening the Ontario Human</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rights Code,</v>

34
00:01:49.621 --> 00:01:50.630
<v Speaker 1>which I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.760
<v Speaker 1>for all I know she might've done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're,</v>

36
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.060
<v Speaker 1>we're at this situation where a Ta</v>
<v Speaker 1>showing a video of someone discussing</v>

37
00:02:00.031 --> 00:02:05.031
<v Speaker 1>pronouns and candidate can now be termed</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hate crime and illegal provincially</v>

38
00:02:06.811 --> 00:02:09.750
<v Speaker 1>and federally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like all the usual suspects have</v>

39
00:02:09.751 --> 00:02:10.584
<v Speaker 1>come out of there.</v>

40
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.680
<v Speaker 1>Their caves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

41
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm like Brenda Cossman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lawyer I debated last year and said,</v>

42
00:02:17.281 --> 00:02:19.260
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a real stretch to assume that what</v>

43
00:02:19.261 --> 00:02:21.890
<v Speaker 1>Lindsay Shepherd did was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

44
00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently reprehensible to actually</v>

45
00:02:26.041 --> 00:02:30.720
<v Speaker 1>constitute a violation of the Ontario</v>
<v Speaker 1>Human Rights Commission guidelines,</v>

46
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.050
<v Speaker 1>policies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

47
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.710
<v Speaker 1>hits a stretch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I guess we're supposed to feel good</v>

48
00:02:34.711 --> 00:02:36.000
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

49
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.020
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm probably a little bit too hot right</v>

50
00:02:40.021 --> 00:02:43.580
<v Speaker 1>now to serve in any official consultant</v>
<v Speaker 1>role.</v>

51
00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.790
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean that I wouldn't be</v>

52
00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:50.610
<v Speaker 1>happy to speak to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.230
<v Speaker 1>political figures who might be</v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in speaking with me because,</v>

54
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I generally speak to people who asked me</v>

55
00:02:57.901 --> 00:02:59.100
<v Speaker 1>to speak to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

56
00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.760
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as reprehensible as that might be.</v>
