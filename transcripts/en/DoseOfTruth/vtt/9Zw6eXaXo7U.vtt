1
00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.430
<v Speaker 1>So plus like crickets are telling you this and so</v>

2
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.240
<v Speaker 1>they're a very reliable source.</v>

3
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:13.871
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4
00:00:13.871 --> 00:00:17.620
<v Speaker 1>So you see the star is star recurs as a Motif in Pinocchio.</v>

5
00:00:17.621 --> 00:00:22.300
<v Speaker 1>And one of the more interesting elements of it here is that when Jupiter wants</v>

6
00:00:22.301 --> 00:00:25.180
<v Speaker 1>to transform his puppet Marionette,</v>

7
00:00:25.181 --> 00:00:29.140
<v Speaker 1>whose being played by forces that operate behind the scenes,</v>

8
00:00:29.141 --> 00:00:33.190
<v Speaker 1>which is really good definition of the persona from a union perspective,</v>

9
00:00:33.191 --> 00:00:33.670
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

10
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.810
<v Speaker 1>And also something indicative of something like an ideological or conceptual</v>

11
00:00:37.811 --> 00:00:38.644
<v Speaker 1>possession.</v>

12
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.060
<v Speaker 1>Japan know who's a good guy,</v>

13
00:00:41.061 --> 00:00:44.960
<v Speaker 1>he's positive father figure re lifts his,</v>

14
00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:46.610
<v Speaker 1>even though he's a patriarchal figure,</v>

15
00:00:46.611 --> 00:00:47.210
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

16
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.230
<v Speaker 1>And a very competent one.</v>

17
00:00:48.231 --> 00:00:52.190
<v Speaker 1>He's still even lifts his eyes up to something that transcends his motive,</v>

18
00:00:52.191 --> 00:00:57.191
<v Speaker 1>be positive as it is and wishes that his creation would undertake the kind of</v>

19
00:00:58.971 --> 00:01:03.890
<v Speaker 1>transformation that would make it autonomous and fully functional as a moral</v>

20
00:01:03.891 --> 00:01:04.340
<v Speaker 1>agent.</v>

21
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:05.091
<v Speaker 1>No strings.</v>

22
00:01:05.091 --> 00:01:05.660
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

23
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.950
<v Speaker 1>So that's very interesting.</v>

24
00:01:06.951 --> 00:01:11.951
<v Speaker 1>I think soldier Pittson said the salvation of mankind lies only in making</v>

25
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.910
<v Speaker 1>everything that concern of all.</v>

26
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.950
<v Speaker 1>That's a pretty decent star light goal,</v>

27
00:01:17.951 --> 00:01:18.784
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

28
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.090
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens in the Pinocchio story is that because,</v>

29
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.050
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is a symbolic representative of what I just described to you,</v>

30
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.500
<v Speaker 1>that happens at a genetic level if you put yourself in new situations.</v>

31
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.220
<v Speaker 1>So Jupiter is roughly culture in the Pinocchio Story,</v>

32
00:01:35.221 --> 00:01:35.461
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

33
00:01:35.461 --> 00:01:35.791
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

34
00:01:35.791 --> 00:01:36.750
<v Speaker 1>he's a craftsman.</v>

35
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.620
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

36
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:38.453
<v Speaker 1>he's uh,</v>

37
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.380
<v Speaker 1>and he makes Pinocchio.</v>

38
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.420
<v Speaker 1>So He's,</v>

39
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.860
<v Speaker 1>he's who's his son,</v>

40
00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.230
<v Speaker 1>he's the socializing agent and</v>

41
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.350
<v Speaker 1>he aims for something above mere socialization,</v>

42
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.290
<v Speaker 1>which is I think part of the mysterious element of human beings.</v>

43
00:01:55.291 --> 00:01:55.471
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

44
00:01:55.471 --> 00:01:59.490
<v Speaker 1>in our scientific models we'd basically have socialization and biology,</v>

45
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.200
<v Speaker 1>but there's always a third element,</v>

46
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.370
<v Speaker 1>mythological stories,</v>

47
00:02:02.371 --> 00:02:07.371
<v Speaker 1>which is whatever you might construe as the spontaneous action of consciousness</v>

48
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.700
<v Speaker 1>that's associated with free will.</v>

49
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.601
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

50
00:02:10.601 --> 00:02:13.210
<v Speaker 1>that's just basically being conceptualized in religious terms.</v>

51
00:02:13.211 --> 00:02:14.770
<v Speaker 1>There's something akin to the soul.</v>

52
00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:15.101
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

53
00:02:15.101 --> 00:02:19.360
<v Speaker 1>we don't have a category for that scientifically because what we try to do</v>

54
00:02:19.361 --> 00:02:23.590
<v Speaker 1>scientifically is to reduce everything either to socialization or to biology.</v>

55
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.980
<v Speaker 1>But it isn't clear to me that that's,</v>

56
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.510
<v Speaker 1>it's perfectly reasonable from the perspective of practicality at a scientific</v>

57
00:02:31.511 --> 00:02:32.230
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

58
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.470
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to multiply explanatory principles beyond necessity.</v>

59
00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.110
<v Speaker 1>But there's many things that that doesn't come to terms with,</v>

60
00:02:38.111 --> 00:02:41.890
<v Speaker 1>such as the fact that we all treat each other as autonomous beings with free</v>

61
00:02:41.891 --> 00:02:43.840
<v Speaker 1>will and that that seems to work.</v>

62
00:02:43.841 --> 00:02:45.070
<v Speaker 1>And that if we stopped doing that,</v>

63
00:02:45.071 --> 00:02:46.150
<v Speaker 1>then things go to hell very,</v>

64
00:02:46.151 --> 00:02:46.984
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly.</v>

65
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.183
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

66
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.330
<v Speaker 1>and the mere fact that we have been able to conceptualize what that conscious</v>

67
00:02:52.331 --> 00:02:53.830
<v Speaker 1>freewill might be,</v>

68
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.420
<v Speaker 1>metaphysically or physically,</v>

69
00:02:55.421 --> 00:02:56.800
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean it doesn't exist.</v>

70
00:02:56.801 --> 00:02:58.570
<v Speaker 1>It just means that we don't understand it.</v>

71
00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean what,</v>

72
00:03:00.131 --> 00:03:04.300
<v Speaker 1>it was only in the last 15 years that we discovered that 95% of the universe was</v>

73
00:03:04.301 --> 00:03:06.880
<v Speaker 1>made out of some kind of matter that we can't even,</v>

74
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.280
<v Speaker 1>whose properties we can't even imagine except that it seems to have mass.</v>

75
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.680
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

76
00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:16.810
<v Speaker 1>what happens is when Japan will reach,</v>

77
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.790
<v Speaker 1>lifts his eyes up to the star.</v>

78
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.390
<v Speaker 1>So it's society aligning itself with the proper goal with regards to individual</v>

79
00:03:25.391 --> 00:03:25.931
<v Speaker 1>development,</v>

80
00:03:25.931 --> 00:03:26.141
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

81
00:03:26.141 --> 00:03:26.974
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

82
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.670
<v Speaker 1>so there instead of society being at odds with the individual,</v>

83
00:03:30.671 --> 00:03:33.850
<v Speaker 1>they line up and then what happens is nature comes on board.</v>

84
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.760
<v Speaker 1>And that's the Blue Fairy and Pinocchio Story.</v>

85
00:03:36.761 --> 00:03:40.120
<v Speaker 1>And that's seems to me to be a symbolic representation of what happens</v>

86
00:03:40.121 --> 00:03:41.890
<v Speaker 1>biologically when,</v>

87
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.470
<v Speaker 1>when you set the goal properly,</v>

88
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.840
<v Speaker 1>get your culture behind you and move into the world,</v>

89
00:03:46.841 --> 00:03:51.460
<v Speaker 1>is that there's a biological transformation that occurs as a consequence of</v>

90
00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:51.641
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

91
00:03:51.641 --> 00:03:55.960
<v Speaker 1>which means that a bunch of you that hasn't been turned on turns on.</v>

92
00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.580
<v Speaker 1>And I guess one question would be is what would you be like if you turned on</v>

93
00:04:00.581 --> 00:04:02.890
<v Speaker 1>everything inside of you that could be turned on?</v>

94
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.791
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

95
00:04:03.791 --> 00:04:04.810
<v Speaker 1>that's a good goal.</v>

96
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.370
<v Speaker 1>That's a good thing to find out.</v>

97
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.480
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
