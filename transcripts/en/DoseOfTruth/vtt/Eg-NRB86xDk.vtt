1
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.850
<v Speaker 1>No wonder people disliked this research.</v>

2
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:10.713
<v Speaker 1>It's so,</v>

3
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.550
<v Speaker 1>it's so anti egalitarianism and it's essential and it's essential structure.</v>

4
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:16.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.410
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to make a second point that I said would be provocative if you want to</v>

6
00:00:20.411 --> 00:00:23.650
<v Speaker 1>do something about this and you know,</v>

7
00:00:23.651 --> 00:00:25.690
<v Speaker 1>be tried to a bunch of interventions,</v>

8
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:26.450
<v Speaker 1>earnest,</v>

9
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:27.460
<v Speaker 1>well funded,</v>

10
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.430
<v Speaker 1>warm term interventions don't seem to work,</v>

11
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.960
<v Speaker 1>but no science has been excluded from discussions about what to do about this</v>

12
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.420
<v Speaker 1>and I believe that neuroscience,</v>

13
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.440
<v Speaker 1>the progress in neuroscience research has the potential to really dramatically</v>

14
00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:50.080
<v Speaker 1>increase the g factor.</v>

15
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.050
<v Speaker 1>Well that's an optimistic statement,</v>

16
00:00:53.051 --> 00:00:55.780
<v Speaker 1>so I'm sure looking forward to some support for that one.</v>

17
00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.980
<v Speaker 1>It's optimistic and reversal and you know,</v>

18
00:00:59.981 --> 00:01:01.930
<v Speaker 1>just as a thought experiment,</v>

19
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.620
<v Speaker 1>and I can tell you why I believe this is possible.</v>

20
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:06.671
<v Speaker 1>What will first,</v>

21
00:01:06.671 --> 00:01:08.350
<v Speaker 1>before I tell you the thought experiment,</v>

22
00:01:08.351 --> 00:01:08.971
<v Speaker 1>the reason I,</v>

23
00:01:08.971 --> 00:01:13.971
<v Speaker 1>I'm optimistic is that B is because of the high heritability of the g factor.</v>

24
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.120
<v Speaker 1>That means your genes are involved.</v>

25
00:01:19.121 --> 00:01:20.800
<v Speaker 1>Gene's work through biology,</v>

26
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.050
<v Speaker 1>even if environment interacts with that,</v>

27
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.770
<v Speaker 1>but basically you have a neuro biological system.</v>

28
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.420
<v Speaker 1>It's complex,</v>

29
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.550
<v Speaker 1>but as you begin to understand it,</v>

30
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.630
<v Speaker 1>you can tweak it.</v>

31
00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.480
<v Speaker 1>This is what all medicine is doing now.</v>

32
00:01:34.481 --> 00:01:39.481
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to understand the neural biology slash genetic basis of our</v>

33
00:01:40.511 --> 00:01:42.220
<v Speaker 1>health and our diseases.</v>

34
00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.293
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

35
00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.440
<v Speaker 1>So they can fix it.</v>

36
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.263
<v Speaker 1>So they didn't get,</v>

37
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.740
<v Speaker 1>when you go to the doctor,</v>

38
00:01:47.741 --> 00:01:52.660
<v Speaker 1>you're going to cause your biology is broken and you let your biology fixed.</v>

39
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.591
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

40
00:01:53.591 --> 00:01:55.660
<v Speaker 1>let's think about the brain.</v>

41
00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:56.081
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

42
00:01:56.081 --> 00:02:01.081
<v Speaker 1>no one conceptualize as low Iq is a disease and it's a little dangerous.</v>

43
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.320
<v Speaker 1>But to the extent to which low Iq has a genetic input or a genetic influence,</v>

44
00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.990
<v Speaker 1>that's the extent to which you might be able to to find out how that works,</v>

45
00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.300
<v Speaker 1>how that's what that system is,</v>

46
00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.540
<v Speaker 1>and then figure out how to tweak that system to increase Iq.</v>

47
00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.670
<v Speaker 1>It's not science fiction.</v>

48
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's it.</v>

49
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.390
<v Speaker 1>That's a plausible sequence of events.</v>

50
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.090
<v Speaker 1>What the problem is,</v>

51
00:02:31.091 --> 00:02:33.310
<v Speaker 1>it's a very complex sequence,</v>

52
00:02:33.311 --> 00:02:34.144
<v Speaker 1>the shirt,</v>

53
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.820
<v Speaker 1>but I also think it's a finite set of problems,</v>

54
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.590
<v Speaker 1>not an infinite set of problems.</v>

55
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.160
<v Speaker 1>So no physicists,</v>

56
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.050
<v Speaker 1>physicists configure out what happened during the first nanoseconds of the big</v>

57
00:02:46.691 --> 00:02:47.524
<v Speaker 1>bang.</v>

58
00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.310
<v Speaker 1>We can certainly figure out what the neurobiology of intellect it is and how to</v>

59
00:02:55.001 --> 00:02:55.834
<v Speaker 1>tweak it.</v>

60
00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.880
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's possible.</v>
