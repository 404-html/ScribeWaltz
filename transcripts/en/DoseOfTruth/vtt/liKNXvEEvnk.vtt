00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:06.581
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2
00:00:06.581 --> 00:00:10.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm leaving Patriot on January 16th.</v>

3
00:00:10.391 --> 00:00:15.391
<v Speaker 1>Some of you may know that that's I suppose in protest over their treatment of</v>

4
00:00:16.811 --> 00:00:17.890
<v Speaker 1>Carl Benjamin,</v>

5
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.100
<v Speaker 1>perhaps better known as Sargon of the cad.</v>

7
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:22.323
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

8
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.470
<v Speaker 1>patron like many companies seems to believe that their role now is to act as</v>

9
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.420
<v Speaker 1>sensor for speech patterns or speech content that they regarded as unacceptable.</v>

10
00:00:34.751 --> 00:00:39.120
<v Speaker 1>And I think that they made a big mistake with Sargon.</v>

11
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.130
<v Speaker 1>And so both Dave Rubin and I and also Sam Harris decided to leave patriotic and</v>

12
00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.650
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be official as of January 15th.</v>

13
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.240
<v Speaker 1>So those of you who are my Patriot on subscribers,</v>

14
00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.030
<v Speaker 1>if you're interested in continuing with that subscription,</v>

15
00:00:55.031 --> 00:01:00.031
<v Speaker 1>you can go to my website@jordanbpeterson.com and there's a support button there</v>

16
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.590
<v Speaker 1>in the menu and you can use that system.</v>

17
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm also trying to design a system that at least in principle,</v>

18
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.820
<v Speaker 1>might work as a reasonable replacement for patriotic.</v>

19
00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.450
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

20
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.590
<v Speaker 1>that's a couple of months away,</v>

21
00:01:14.591 --> 00:01:16.140
<v Speaker 1>but we're working hard on it to,</v>

22
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.590
<v Speaker 1>we're getting legal advice.</v>

23
00:01:17.591 --> 00:01:21.940
<v Speaker 1>We're going to set up multiple payment channels so that it won't be easy for</v>

24
00:01:21.941 --> 00:01:25.390
<v Speaker 1>people to be kicked off by credit card companies,</v>

25
00:01:25.391 --> 00:01:27.190
<v Speaker 1>or let's call them,</v>

26
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:28.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

27
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.440
<v Speaker 1>virtue signaling,</v>

28
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

29
00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.080
<v Speaker 1>ethical types who think that their role is to police free speech.</v>

30
00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.610
<v Speaker 1>So I think this is a very bad precedent that patron is set and the credit card</v>

31
00:01:39.611 --> 00:01:40.181
<v Speaker 1>companies too,</v>

32
00:01:40.181 --> 00:01:45.181
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine it's difficult to imagine a more dystopian scenario than to have</v>

33
00:01:45.791 --> 00:01:46.624
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

34
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:47.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.910
<v Speaker 1>large tech companies in combination with the credit card companies monitor your</v>

36
00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:56.911
<v Speaker 1>spending to decide when what you're doing is sufficiently ethical by their,</v>

37
00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.430
<v Speaker 1>by the standards of the people who are running their,</v>

38
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.590
<v Speaker 1>let's call them safety and security,</v>

39
00:02:02.591 --> 00:02:04.360
<v Speaker 1>speech monitoring programs.</v>

40
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.190
<v Speaker 1>It's just such a terrible idea.</v>
