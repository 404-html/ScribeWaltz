00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:07.293
<v Speaker 1>The brain is,</v>

2
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.300
<v Speaker 1>has specialized subsystem,</v>

3
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.590
<v Speaker 1>but dynamic biological systems so you can muck about with it quite a bit and</v>

4
00:00:13.591 --> 00:00:15.990
<v Speaker 1>it'll set itself up in slightly different ways.</v>

5
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.210
<v Speaker 1>So the systems aren't necessarily localized exactly the same place in every one.</v>

6
00:00:21.211 --> 00:00:22.590
<v Speaker 1>But roughly speaking,</v>

7
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.220
<v Speaker 1>everyone has those systems and roughly speaking,</v>

8
00:00:26.221 --> 00:00:28.020
<v Speaker 1>they're in the same place across people.</v>

9
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.640
<v Speaker 1>Now there's a lot of variability and it's one of the things that makes you know,</v>

10
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.430
<v Speaker 1>Mri studies in the life very difficult to interpret because if you average</v>

11
00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:36.600
<v Speaker 1>across a lot of people,</v>

12
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.150
<v Speaker 1>what it means is you're blur things out,</v>

13
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.901
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:00:39.901 --> 00:00:42.990
<v Speaker 1>cause you can only extract out what the commonalities and although you know,</v>

15
00:00:42.991 --> 00:00:44.790
<v Speaker 1>they're getting better and better at dealing with that,</v>

16
00:00:44.791 --> 00:00:45.624
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

17
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.850
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

18
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:48.683
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

19
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.213
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

20
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.470
<v Speaker 1>there's other ways that you can think about the brain too.</v>

21
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.380
<v Speaker 1>These are all approaches to understanding it.</v>

22
00:00:58.381 --> 00:00:58.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

23
00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:59.210
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

24
00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.560
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

25
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.510
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's a very,</v>

26
00:01:00.511 --> 00:01:01.560
<v Speaker 1>very complex thing.</v>

27
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.131
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

28
00:01:02.131 --> 00:01:03.770
<v Speaker 1>it's the most complex thing near it.</v>

29
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.411
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

30
00:01:04.411 --> 00:01:09.411
<v Speaker 1>there are more patterns of combinations of neural connections in your brain.</v>

31
00:01:09.691 --> 00:01:12.150
<v Speaker 1>Then there are subatomic particles in the universe.</v>

32
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.230
<v Speaker 1>So you are,</v>

33
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.791
<v Speaker 1>I know you,</v>

34
00:01:13.791 --> 00:01:15.690
<v Speaker 1>you won't believe that cause it doesn't seem possible.</v>

35
00:01:15.691 --> 00:01:19.070
<v Speaker 1>But you can do the math and you'll figure out that it's actually write it.</v>

36
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.160
<v Speaker 1>So you're the most complicated thing there is and by a lot.</v>

37
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.120
<v Speaker 1>And so in some sense there's more space inside your head.</v>

38
00:01:27.121 --> 00:01:28.980
<v Speaker 1>Then there is space outside your head.</v>

39
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.410
<v Speaker 1>It depends on how you conceptualize space,</v>

40
00:01:31.411 --> 00:01:31.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:01:31.651 --> 00:01:36.360
<v Speaker 1>because you can conceptualize space as the number of ways that something can be</v>

42
00:01:36.361 --> 00:01:39.310
<v Speaker 1>configured and that state space and that's a,</v>

43
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.910
<v Speaker 1>that's a magnitude measurement,</v>

44
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:42.211
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

45
00:01:42.211 --> 00:01:43.770
<v Speaker 1>and the distance between things,</v>

46
00:01:43.771 --> 00:01:45.870
<v Speaker 1>well that's another way of conceptualizing space.</v>

47
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.150
<v Speaker 1>But if you're wanting,</v>

48
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.720
<v Speaker 1>if you want to think about big,</v>

49
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.730
<v Speaker 1>what's inside you is,</v>

50
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.910
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's bigger than what's outside.</v>

51
00:01:53.911 --> 00:01:55.860
<v Speaker 1>You would certainly that way in terms of complexity,</v>

52
00:01:55.861 --> 00:01:59.160
<v Speaker 1>unless you factor in the other brains know so.</v>

53
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.190
<v Speaker 1>So that's very much worth thinking about means that you know,</v>

54
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.610
<v Speaker 1>what we don't understand about the brain is going to fill many,</v>

55
00:02:05.611 --> 00:02:06.361
<v Speaker 1>many books.</v>

56
00:02:06.361 --> 00:02:09.720
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things we really don't understand his consciousness,</v>

57
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.310
<v Speaker 1>people just don't get that.</v>

58
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.960
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't really look,</v>

59
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.291
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

60
00:02:13.291 --> 00:02:18.000
<v Speaker 1>you might think that consciousness is an emergent late evolutionary function,</v>

61
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.301
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

62
00:02:18.301 --> 00:02:19.770
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't really look like that,</v>

63
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.670
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

64
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:21.031
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

65
00:02:21.031 --> 00:02:23.070
<v Speaker 1>when even when people become demented and,</v>

66
00:02:23.071 --> 00:02:23.311
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>

67
00:02:23.311 --> 00:02:25.710
<v Speaker 1>you lose almost all of their higher cortical function.</v>

68
00:02:25.711 --> 00:02:27.540
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt there's still conscious.</v>

69
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.580
<v Speaker 1>And so consciousness might be way,</v>

70
00:02:29.581 --> 00:02:29.971
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

71
00:02:29.971 --> 00:02:31.350
<v Speaker 1>way older than we think.</v>

72
00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:32.041
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>

73
00:02:32.041 --> 00:02:33.240
<v Speaker 1>I think it's highly probable.</v>

74
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't think a hypothalamic cat is unconscious.</v>

75
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.460
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly a wake,</v>

76
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.371
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

77
00:02:38.371 --> 00:02:42.030
<v Speaker 1>and distinguishing between awake and conscious is no easy thing.</v>

78
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.661
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>

79
00:02:42.661 --> 00:02:42.871
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

80
00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:44.070
<v Speaker 1>animals aren't conscious.</v>

81
00:02:44.071 --> 00:02:44.491
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

82
00:02:44.491 --> 00:02:44.910
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

83
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:45.743
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

84
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.100
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing.</v>

85
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.691
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

86
00:02:48.691 --> 00:02:53.430
<v Speaker 1>what people norm normally think is that humans are different than other animals.</v>

87
00:02:53.431 --> 00:02:56.640
<v Speaker 1>And so before you anthropomorphize an animal,</v>

88
00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.230
<v Speaker 1>you should be careful.</v>

89
00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Speaker 1>But I think that's complete rubbish.</v>

90
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.900
<v Speaker 1>I think it's exactly the opposite.</v>

91
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.800
<v Speaker 1>Before you assumed that humans have attributes that animals don't,</v>

92
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.410
<v Speaker 1>you have to prove it because there's continuity,</v>

93
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:09.431
<v Speaker 1>tremendous,</v>

94
00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:10.900
<v Speaker 1>tremendous continuity.</v>

95
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.320
<v Speaker 1>And so it's right to anthropomorphize animals.</v>

96
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.600
<v Speaker 1>What's wrong is to presume a priority that humans are qualitatively different.</v>

97
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.991
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

98
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:21.940
<v Speaker 1>there are some very bizarre things about us.</v>

99
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.923
<v Speaker 1>Obviously,</v>

100
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.970
<v Speaker 1>you know these,</v>

101
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.470
<v Speaker 1>we have opposable thumbs.</v>

102
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.640
<v Speaker 1>That's a big deal.</v>

103
00:03:27.641 --> 00:03:28.780
<v Speaker 1>We can grip things.</v>

104
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.250
<v Speaker 1>That's a massive deal,</v>

105
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

106
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.700
<v Speaker 1>and it turns out that there's another,</v>

107
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.181
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

108
00:03:34.181 --> 00:03:34.660
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

109
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:35.170
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

110
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.170
<v Speaker 1>your brain maps your body onto its surface onto its motor strip,</v>

111
00:03:40.361 --> 00:03:41.440
<v Speaker 1>and it's sensory strip,</v>

112
00:03:41.441 --> 00:03:43.630
<v Speaker 1>which are roughly here on the brain.</v>

113
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.830
<v Speaker 1>And if you take the motor strip or the sensory strip and you make a</v>

114
00:03:47.831 --> 00:03:51.070
<v Speaker 1>representation of how it represents the body,</v>

115
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:52.470
<v Speaker 1>which is called a Homerun,</v>

116
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.171
<v Speaker 1>keyless wielder,</v>

117
00:03:53.171 --> 00:03:56.410
<v Speaker 1>Penfield wilder Penfield still did this first at McGill university.</v>

118
00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:57.520
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

119
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know this and perhaps you'll be fortunate enough to</v>

120
00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:01.474
<v Speaker 1>experience it,</v>

121
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.430
<v Speaker 1>but people who have brain surgery are conscious when it happens.</v>

122
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.420
<v Speaker 1>And that's so that the surgeons can figure out whether this little part is doing</v>

123
00:04:10.421 --> 00:04:12.100
<v Speaker 1>anything important before they take it out.</v>

124
00:04:12.101 --> 00:04:12.430
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

125
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:13.900
<v Speaker 1>it's a very horrific thought.</v>
