1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:00.973
<v Speaker 1>Hmm,</v>

2
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.380
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scandinavians have this idea that</v>

3
00:00:09.381 --> 00:00:12.530
<v Speaker 1>the world is a tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

4
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.900
<v Speaker 1>I'd been thinking about that a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that the tree idea tree is</v>

5
00:00:17.901 --> 00:00:21.470
<v Speaker 1>something that is grounded in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in matter,</v>

6
00:00:21.471 --> 00:00:23.510
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that reaches up to heaven in the</v>

7
00:00:23.511 --> 00:00:26.300
<v Speaker 1>Scandinavian tree at the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's quite a cool idea at the bottom</v>

8
00:00:26.301 --> 00:00:27.081
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

9
00:00:27.081 --> 00:00:29.780
<v Speaker 1>this tree is constantly being not by</v>
<v Speaker 1>snakes.</v>

10
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.350
<v Speaker 1>You can sort of see the snakes at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom and at the same time it's being</v>

11
00:00:33.351 --> 00:00:37.160
<v Speaker 1>watered and the water makes the tree</v>
<v Speaker 1>grow at the same rate that the snakes no</v>

12
00:00:37.161 --> 00:00:39.800
<v Speaker 1>on its roots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like a Yin Yang idea,</v>

13
00:00:39.801 --> 00:00:41.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's continual chaotic</v>

14
00:00:41.991 --> 00:00:45.530
<v Speaker 1>destruction and replacement at the basis</v>
<v Speaker 1>of whatever this process is.</v>

15
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.110
<v Speaker 1>But the tree seems to me to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>representation,</v>

16
00:00:48.111 --> 00:00:52.430
<v Speaker 1>not so much of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a different dimensional space.</v>

17
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.410
<v Speaker 1>That's what's trying to be represented.</v>

18
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.230
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're structured.</v>

19
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.120
<v Speaker 1>If you take powers of 10 magnification,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say human beings are about in the middle</v>

20
00:01:02.121 --> 00:01:06.020
<v Speaker 1>of the tiniest thing and the largest</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing if you do it by,</v>

21
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.060
<v Speaker 1>by powers of 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

22
00:01:08.061 --> 00:01:10.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a sub atomic level and an</v>

23
00:01:10.701 --> 00:01:13.250
<v Speaker 1>atomic level on a molecular level and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.273
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

25
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.470
<v Speaker 1>that are maybe a level of organs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's you and then there's your</v>

26
00:01:18.471 --> 00:01:23.390
<v Speaker 1>family and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the way up the tree fundamentally.</v>

27
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.030
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that what this tree</v>
<v Speaker 1>represents,</v>

28
00:01:26.031 --> 00:01:29.000
<v Speaker 1>and this is the things that thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shaman moves up and down,</v>

29
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.950
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what it represents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this,</v>

30
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.850
<v Speaker 1>it's this different view of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of its dimensionality.</v>

31
00:01:34.851 --> 00:01:36.830
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that what happens in the</v>

32
00:01:36.831 --> 00:01:39.920
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic experiences that</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness can travel up and down</v>

33
00:01:39.921 --> 00:01:41.840
<v Speaker 1>that structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that,</v>

34
00:01:41.841 --> 00:01:45.050
<v Speaker 1>and maybe not only up and down it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe right through it.</v>

35
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.070
<v Speaker 1>I know that's a radical claim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a really radical claim.</v>

36
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.240
<v Speaker 1>And if it might be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's probably wrong even because</v>

37
00:01:53.241 --> 00:01:54.860
<v Speaker 1>most radical claims are wrong.</v>

38
00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.350
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

39
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.270
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not so sure it's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's something cool.</v>

40
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.600
<v Speaker 1>So that's the Scandinavian world tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was drawn by an anthropologist</v>

41
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:18.420
<v Speaker 1>who visited the tribes in the Amazon who</v>
<v Speaker 1>use IOWASCA.</v>

42
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.150
<v Speaker 1>Now you see it's a snake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a tree with snakes.</v>

43
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.141
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:02:28.141 --> 00:02:31.410
<v Speaker 1>that's reminiscent of the story in Adam</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Eve obviously,</v>

45
00:02:31.411 --> 00:02:34.680
<v Speaker 1>but it's also reminiscent of our primate</v>
<v Speaker 1>dwelling place,</v>

46
00:02:34.681 --> 00:02:36.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that was basically our ancestral</v>

47
00:02:36.961 --> 00:02:40.350
<v Speaker 1>home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tree surrounded by snakes and the</v>

48
00:02:40.351 --> 00:02:42.870
<v Speaker 1>snakes like to eat us and this is a long</v>
<v Speaker 1>time ago.</v>

49
00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:43.704
<v Speaker 1>This is like</v>

50
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.470
<v Speaker 1>$50 million years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really a long time ago and so we</v>

51
00:02:49.471 --> 00:02:52.470
<v Speaker 1>don't know where these images come from</v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely,</v>

52
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.830
<v Speaker 1>but I do have the suspicion that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we use the circuitry that we developed</v>

53
00:02:59.621 --> 00:03:04.621
<v Speaker 1>to detect snakes to represent the</v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown as such because like snake is</v>

54
00:03:05.531 --> 00:03:08.590
<v Speaker 1>something that comes out of the unknown</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like we evolved,</v>

55
00:03:08.591 --> 00:03:10.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all evolved out of an animal</v>

56
00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.310
<v Speaker 1>substructure and so we had to get our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our biological cognitive structure from</v>

57
00:03:16.361 --> 00:03:20.080
<v Speaker 1>somewhere and we have this capacity of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about the absolute unknown and</v>

58
00:03:20.081 --> 00:03:24.040
<v Speaker 1>the terrors that are involved in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The horrors that can emerge from what we</v>

59
00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:26.230
<v Speaker 1>don't understand and it stands</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly.</v>

60
00:03:26.231 --> 00:03:30.490
<v Speaker 1>The reason that we would use circuits</v>
<v Speaker 1>that were already pre developed for that</v>

61
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.240
<v Speaker 1>and that this is a reasonable</v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of the existential</v>

62
00:03:34.241 --> 00:03:36.700
<v Speaker 1>structure of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

63
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.720
<v Speaker 1>I think I might've showed you this</v>
<v Speaker 1>before but</v>

64
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.460
<v Speaker 1>it never ceases to amaze me this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this picture.</v>

65
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.460
<v Speaker 1>So my son drew this when he was nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight and so on the right you see</v>

66
00:03:50.471 --> 00:03:55.471
<v Speaker 1>mushroom houses and they have the names</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all his friends on them and so that's</v>

67
00:03:56.381 --> 00:04:00.130
<v Speaker 1>order right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then on the left side you see chaos</v>

68
00:04:00.131 --> 00:04:03.970
<v Speaker 1>there and that little orange thing is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bug and then there's a river that runs</v>

69
00:04:03.971 --> 00:04:08.680
<v Speaker 1>right down the middle and so that's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the know the Yin Yang symbol with the</v>

70
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.960
<v Speaker 1>divide in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's quite cool.</v>

71
00:04:10.961 --> 00:04:12.100
<v Speaker 1>And then there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there it is,</v>

72
00:04:12.101 --> 00:04:15.190
<v Speaker 1>there's Jacob's ladder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like Jack and the beanstalk,</v>

73
00:04:15.191 --> 00:04:19.870
<v Speaker 1>which is by the way another variant of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same shamonic story and there are</v>

74
00:04:19.871 --> 00:04:24.310
<v Speaker 1>bugs going up and down it and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're taking messages from heaven and</v>

75
00:04:24.311 --> 00:04:29.311
<v Speaker 1>then up there and haven't got the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's St Peter and I don't know</v>

76
00:04:29.501 --> 00:04:32.440
<v Speaker 1>where in the world he got this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like he had a lot of religious</v>

77
00:04:32.441 --> 00:04:35.110
<v Speaker 1>education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean read despite me.</v>

78
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

79
00:04:37.021 --> 00:04:38.530
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the pearly gates up there and</v>

80
00:04:38.531 --> 00:04:42.430
<v Speaker 1>then that was the world as far as his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a very well ordered psyche I</v>

81
00:04:42.431 --> 00:04:43.264
<v Speaker 1>would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

82
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.640
<v Speaker 1>and still does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when he drew that,</v>

83
00:04:45.641 --> 00:04:49.690
<v Speaker 1>it just absolutely blew me away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I had it laminated and it's in my</v>

84
00:04:49.691 --> 00:04:52.290
<v Speaker 1>office because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

85
00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't know because like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell do you make of that?</v>

86
00:04:54.641 --> 00:04:55.380
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

87
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.430
<v Speaker 1>that's why so,</v>

88
00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.820
<v Speaker 1>well you sort of get the picture there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

89
00:05:10.821 --> 00:05:15.821
<v Speaker 1>the cathedral is the great cathedrals of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe or they're like the forest in</v>

90
00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:17.241
<v Speaker 1>stone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

91
00:05:17.241 --> 00:05:21.380
<v Speaker 1>And they try to represent the light</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming through the leaves and so it's</v>

92
00:05:21.381 --> 00:05:23.700
<v Speaker 1>sort of our ancestral forest home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

93
00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.790
<v Speaker 1>it's transformed into these great</v>
<v Speaker 1>sculptures of stone and you know,</v>

94
00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.760
<v Speaker 1>they produce all because of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>combination of light and darkness and</v>

95
00:05:31.761 --> 00:05:34.040
<v Speaker 1>color.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also I think for the same reason</v>

96
00:05:34.041 --> 00:05:36.800
<v Speaker 1>that huge trees produce art and people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

97
00:05:36.801 --> 00:05:39.800
<v Speaker 1>and we don't want them cut down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They seem sacred in some sense.</v>

98
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.350
<v Speaker 1>And perhaps they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

99
00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.910
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it also seemed to me this is an</v>

100
00:05:46.911 --> 00:05:51.740
<v Speaker 1>intuition that the the architects of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these great cathedrals were trying to</v>

101
00:05:51.741 --> 00:05:54.050
<v Speaker 1>get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to express something</v>

102
00:05:54.051 --> 00:05:57.560
<v Speaker 1>that's deep and structural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're trying try and try and to</v>

103
00:05:57.561 --> 00:06:00.500
<v Speaker 1>express the idea that if being was</v>
<v Speaker 1>constituted properly,</v>

104
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.480
<v Speaker 1>then it would be organized from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>subatomic level all the way up to the</v>

105
00:06:05.481 --> 00:06:10.220
<v Speaker 1>highest cosmic level perfectly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so every layer stacked on top of each</v>

106
00:06:10.221 --> 00:06:14.720
<v Speaker 1>other without any contradictions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be an ideal mode of being and</v>

107
00:06:14.721 --> 00:06:17.510
<v Speaker 1>everything would come together under</v>
<v Speaker 1>those circumstances.</v>

108
00:06:17.511 --> 00:06:20.180
<v Speaker 1>And that's what's being expressed in</v>
<v Speaker 1>these cathedrals.</v>

109
00:06:20.181 --> 00:06:23.420
<v Speaker 1>It's not all that's being expressed</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're also shaped like a cross</v>

110
00:06:23.421 --> 00:06:26.180
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea is that the center of the</v>

111
00:06:26.181 --> 00:06:27.920
<v Speaker 1>Cross,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the center of suffering,</v>

112
00:06:27.921 --> 00:06:31.460
<v Speaker 1>is also the place of the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The place where the transformation takes</v>

113
00:06:31.461 --> 00:06:33.320
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all built into the architecture</v>

114
00:06:33.321 --> 00:06:34.940
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

115
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.240
<v Speaker 1>then there's the tree like structures</v>
<v Speaker 1>that make us up.</v>

116
00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:51.020
<v Speaker 1>It's stretched down to the tiniest</v>
<v Speaker 1>realities,</v>

117
00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:53.410
<v Speaker 1>the microcosm,</v>

118
00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.200
<v Speaker 1>and there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea,</v>

119
00:07:01.201 --> 00:07:03.090
<v Speaker 1>it's all represented in the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

120
00:07:03.091 --> 00:07:06.060
<v Speaker 1>it's this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the Mandela up in the top</v>

121
00:07:06.061 --> 00:07:08.760
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the idea of his perfection of</v>

122
00:07:08.761 --> 00:07:12.990
<v Speaker 1>crystalline structure and that's what</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Yogis are trying to attain when they</v>

123
00:07:12.991 --> 00:07:15.840
<v Speaker 1>organize their bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to get every single layer</v>

124
00:07:15.841 --> 00:07:19.140
<v Speaker 1>of there being aligned properly and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like,</v>

125
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.810
<v Speaker 1>and you can kind of see an echo of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the.</v>

126
00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:26.130
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a Tibetan sand painting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>

127
00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.880
<v Speaker 1>on the on the bottom left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that if you get yourself</v>

128
00:07:29.881 --> 00:07:33.060
<v Speaker 1>aligned properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then information can flow along that</v>

129
00:07:33.061 --> 00:07:35.580
<v Speaker 1>tree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's you without</v>

130
00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:39.340
<v Speaker 1>without impediment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

131
00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:44.560
<v Speaker 1>and that would be like a state of</v>
<v Speaker 1>optimal health and that both physical</v>

132
00:07:44.561 --> 00:07:49.180
<v Speaker 1>and spiritual exercises can put you in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that state and that's while those are</v>

133
00:07:49.181 --> 00:07:52.180
<v Speaker 1>all clouds of ideas that surround this</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of a ladder to heaven.</v>
