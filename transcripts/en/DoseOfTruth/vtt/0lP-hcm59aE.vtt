1
00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:07.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.580
<v Speaker 1>from a strictly scientific perspective,</v>

3
00:00:09.581 --> 00:00:12.970
<v Speaker 1>we think of human beings has nothing but the children of nature and culture.</v>

4
00:00:12.971 --> 00:00:16.750
<v Speaker 1>And that pushes you towards a kind of deterministic view.</v>

5
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.950
<v Speaker 1>What causes your behavior?</v>

6
00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:18.071
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

7
00:00:18.071 --> 00:00:20.620
<v Speaker 1>it's either nature or culture because there isn't anything else.</v>

8
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.400
<v Speaker 1>But that isn't how the mythological story lays itself out because it says there</v>

9
00:00:24.401 --> 00:00:27.310
<v Speaker 1>is something else and that's whatever your consciousness is.</v>

10
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.020
<v Speaker 1>And that consciousness seems to be able to work with nature and culture in a non</v>

11
00:00:32.021 --> 00:00:37.021
<v Speaker 1>deterministic manner in order to bring well in order for what?</v>

12
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.980
<v Speaker 1>In order to bring itself forward.</v>

13
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.251
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

14
00:00:42.251 --> 00:00:46.300
<v Speaker 1>and that's really what's interesting about that I think is that it isn't</v>

15
00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.250
<v Speaker 1>obviously just the plot of Pinocchio,</v>

16
00:00:48.251 --> 00:00:51.880
<v Speaker 1>it's virtually the plot of any story is the story of the development of the</v>

17
00:00:51.881 --> 00:00:52.510
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>

18
00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.650
<v Speaker 1>Now the story is order chaos,</v>

19
00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.150
<v Speaker 1>higher order,</v>

20
00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.050
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>

21
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.610
<v Speaker 1>So you can get variants of that.</v>

22
00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.610
<v Speaker 1>You can get order collapses into disorder and nothing is resolved.</v>

23
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.000
<v Speaker 1>That's a tragedy,</v>

24
00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.013
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

25
00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.800
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

26
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.580
<v Speaker 1>and you can get so,</v>

27
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.590
<v Speaker 1>so you don't have to have the entire story represented in his story,</v>

28
00:01:14.591 --> 00:01:15.700
<v Speaker 1>but you get fragments of it.</v>

29
00:01:15.701 --> 00:01:16.570
<v Speaker 1>It's a classic.</v>

30
00:01:16.571 --> 00:01:19.900
<v Speaker 1>You shaped story and what it is is the story of the development of the</v>

31
00:01:19.901 --> 00:01:24.040
<v Speaker 1>individual across time as a consequence of his or her adventures in time and</v>

32
00:01:24.041 --> 00:01:24.551
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>

33
00:01:24.551 --> 00:01:27.760
<v Speaker 1>And every story is exactly that.</v>

34
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.150
<v Speaker 1>And those are representations of the manner in which you come to be in the world</v>

35
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.260
<v Speaker 1>for better or for worse.</v>

36
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.490
<v Speaker 1>It's differentiated.</v>

37
00:01:36.491 --> 00:01:38.420
<v Speaker 1>So the individual has a negative and a pause.</v>

38
00:01:38.421 --> 00:01:40.870
<v Speaker 1>Development and culture has a negative and a pause.</v>

39
00:01:40.871 --> 00:01:42.790
<v Speaker 1>Development and nature does as well,</v>

40
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.810
<v Speaker 1>and that makes the potential for plots much broader.</v>

41
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.060
<v Speaker 1>But I think it's also very useful to know that entire story because I think it's</v>

42
00:01:52.061 --> 00:01:54.220
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that protects you against ideology.</v>

43
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.671
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

44
00:01:54.671 --> 00:01:55.001
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

45
00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:59.260
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if someone tells you a political story or a story of any sort,</v>

46
00:01:59.261 --> 00:02:00.041
<v Speaker 1>you can always ask,</v>

47
00:02:00.041 --> 00:02:00.221
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

48
00:02:00.221 --> 00:02:01.510
<v Speaker 1>where are the missing characters?</v>

49
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:02.980
<v Speaker 1>Human beings are terrible.</v>

50
00:02:02.981 --> 00:02:06.950
<v Speaker 1>They've erected a culture that's destroying the planet and nature is beneath,</v>

51
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

52
00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.520
<v Speaker 1>benevolent and and pristine.</v>

53
00:02:09.521 --> 00:02:09.851
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

54
00:02:09.851 --> 00:02:10.061
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

55
00:02:10.061 --> 00:02:10.780
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>

56
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:11.291
<v Speaker 1>Accurate.</v>

57
00:02:11.291 --> 00:02:15.580
<v Speaker 1>But you're missing half the characters because humans are not just terrible</v>

58
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.660
<v Speaker 1>rapacious creatures.</v>

59
00:02:16.661 --> 00:02:19.510
<v Speaker 1>And culture is not just a destructive force in nature,</v>

60
00:02:19.511 --> 00:02:21.370
<v Speaker 1>is by no means on our side.</v>

61
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.190
<v Speaker 1>So where's the missing characters?</v>

62
00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.580
<v Speaker 1>You need all of the characters in the representation to get it right.</v>

63
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.680
<v Speaker 1>And I really believe this to be true.</v>

64
00:02:29.681 --> 00:02:30.610
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

65
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.080
<v Speaker 1>if you want to protect yourself against trauma as you move forward in life,</v>

66
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.330
<v Speaker 1>you have to be very aware of the three,</v>

67
00:02:37.331 --> 00:02:38.740
<v Speaker 1>three negative characters.</v>

68
00:02:38.741 --> 00:02:42.580
<v Speaker 1>You have to know that the human individual has an adversarial element that's</v>

69
00:02:42.581 --> 00:02:44.140
<v Speaker 1>malevolent right to the core.</v>

70
00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.590
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't know that and you run across someone who's malevolent,</v>

71
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.630
<v Speaker 1>you will end up damaged.</v>

72
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.390
<v Speaker 1>So because first you won't be able to defend yourself.</v>

73
00:02:52.391 --> 00:02:55.690
<v Speaker 1>You'll just be like a ripe fruit tree for the plucking and second,</v>

74
00:02:55.691 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 1>the mere existence of someone like that will pose such a to the way that you've</v>

75
00:03:00.101 --> 00:03:01.030
<v Speaker 1>organized the world,</v>

76
00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:02.350
<v Speaker 1>that it might collapse on you.</v>

77
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.300
<v Speaker 1>That happens to people all the time.</v>

78
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.900
<v Speaker 1>So it really matters whether you know these categories and it matters that you</v>

79
00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:09.850
<v Speaker 1>know that culture can become tyrannical.</v>

80
00:03:09.851 --> 00:03:10.270
<v Speaker 1>It really,</v>

81
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.030
<v Speaker 1>but that it's also you're the father that's given you everything.</v>

82
00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:14.770
<v Speaker 1>And it matters that you know,</v>

83
00:03:14.771 --> 00:03:17.860
<v Speaker 1>everything good comes from nature and that we need to live in harmony with</v>

84
00:03:17.861 --> 00:03:18.760
<v Speaker 1>nature to some degree.</v>

85
00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:22.660
<v Speaker 1>But that it's also a hell bent on our destruction every second.</v>

86
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.700
<v Speaker 1>And it's very paradoxical.</v>

87
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:25.061
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

88
00:03:25.061 --> 00:03:26.980
<v Speaker 1>it's a hard thing to reconcile with,</v>

89
00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:27.310
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

90
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.143
<v Speaker 1>with uh,</v>

91
00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.260
<v Speaker 1>without a thought structure like modern science that's based on a strict logic</v>

92
00:03:32.261 --> 00:03:35.980
<v Speaker 1>that always says something can't be itself and its opposite at the same time.</v>

93
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:36.701
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

94
00:03:36.701 --> 00:03:41.701
<v Speaker 1>human beings can certainly be something and its opposite at the same time and</v>

95
00:03:41.801 --> 00:03:45.640
<v Speaker 1>anything truly complex can have that and does have that nature.</v>

96
00:03:45.641 --> 00:03:47.200
<v Speaker 1>If someone offers you a new job,</v>

97
00:03:47.201 --> 00:03:47.561
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

98
00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:48.640
<v Speaker 1>well that's positive.</v>

99
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.870
<v Speaker 1>It's like no it's not.</v>

100
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.170
<v Speaker 1>It's positive and negative and complex.</v>

101
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.830
<v Speaker 1>It might be the solution to your problem but at the same set time it's going to</v>

102
00:03:56.831 --> 00:03:58.750
<v Speaker 1>generate a whole host of other problems.</v>

103
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.730
<v Speaker 1>So lots of times we're,</v>

104
00:04:00.731 --> 00:04:01.180
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

105
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.010
<v Speaker 1>we're encountering entities in some sense that have an internally paradoxical</v>

106
00:04:06.011 --> 00:04:09.240
<v Speaker 1>structure and we have to deal with that entire set of paradoxes or,</v>

107
00:04:09.241 --> 00:04:10.510
<v Speaker 1>or we don't survive.</v>

108
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.340
<v Speaker 1>It's really a matter of survival.</v>

109
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:13.241
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

110
00:04:13.241 --> 00:04:14.074
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

111
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:15.243
<v Speaker 1>so I'm,</v>

112
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.420
<v Speaker 1>and then you know,</v>

113
00:04:16.421 --> 00:04:17.950
<v Speaker 1>there's this overarching symbol,</v>

114
00:04:17.951 --> 00:04:19.330
<v Speaker 1>which is the dragon of chaos,</v>

115
00:04:19.331 --> 00:04:20.740
<v Speaker 1>which is potential itself.</v>

116
00:04:20.741 --> 00:04:23.620
<v Speaker 1>And it's the potential from which all of these categories emerge.</v>

117
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.540
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>

118
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.740
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

119
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.790
<v Speaker 1>the most abstract category of our imagination is that,</v>

120
00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:34.030
<v Speaker 1>which is beyond our understanding the category of that which is beyond our</v>

121
00:04:34.031 --> 00:04:34.864
<v Speaker 1>understanding.</v>

122
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.250
<v Speaker 1>And that seems to me to be represented because we can only use the</v>

123
00:04:39.251 --> 00:04:41.440
<v Speaker 1>representational structures that we evolved,</v>

124
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.770
<v Speaker 1>is that it's represented in our paradoxical representation of the Predator and</v>

125
00:04:47.501 --> 00:04:49.930
<v Speaker 1>the treasure that lies beyond the perimeter,</v>

126
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.800
<v Speaker 1>that perimeter perimeters of our safe societies.</v>

127
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.840
<v Speaker 1>So what's out there beyond,</v>

128
00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.261
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

129
00:04:56.261 --> 00:04:57.040
<v Speaker 1>we don't know,</v>

130
00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.310
<v Speaker 1>but we need to know because we need always to deal with what we don't know.</v>

131
00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.390
<v Speaker 1>So weirdly enough,</v>

132
00:05:01.391 --> 00:05:04.660
<v Speaker 1>we have to come up with a category of what we don't know in order to start</v>

133
00:05:04.661 --> 00:05:09.661
<v Speaker 1>formalizing a theory about how we might progress towards it and interact with</v>

134
00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:10.210
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

135
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.960
<v Speaker 1>It's very paradoxical idea and there's a paradoxical answer,</v>

136
00:05:13.961 --> 00:05:14.171
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

137
00:05:14.171 --> 00:05:14.351
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

138
00:05:14.351 --> 00:05:18.220
<v Speaker 1>it's the terrible Predator that lurks in the unknown that also harbors something</v>

139
00:05:18.221 --> 00:05:19.054
<v Speaker 1>of great value.</v>

140
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:20.343
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

141
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:21.071
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

142
00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:21.970
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right.</v>

143
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.990
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right.</v>

144
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.550
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that is a reflection of the fact that human beings are Predator</v>

145
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.040
<v Speaker 1>animals and prey animals at the same time.</v>

146
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.450
<v Speaker 1>So what's out there in the,</v>

147
00:05:31.451 --> 00:05:33.310
<v Speaker 1>in the terrible darkness,</v>

148
00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.360
<v Speaker 1>something that can destroy you but also something that you absolutely need.</v>

149
00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:38.590
<v Speaker 1>So how do you,</v>

150
00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.380
<v Speaker 1>how do you prepare yourself for that?</v>

151
00:05:41.381 --> 00:05:43.030
<v Speaker 1>And that's the ultimate question of life.</v>

152
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:44.920
<v Speaker 1>It's not how do you deal with death,</v>

153
00:05:44.921 --> 00:05:47.590
<v Speaker 1>although death is a sub component of the terrible unknown,</v>

154
00:05:47.591 --> 00:05:51.190
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's how do you deal with that which is beyond your understanding,</v>

155
00:05:51.191 --> 00:05:54.010
<v Speaker 1>which is constantly manifesting itself in the world.</v>

156
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.821
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

157
00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:58.730
<v Speaker 1>and that manifests itself every time you categorize something and the thing</v>

158
00:05:58.731 --> 00:05:59.900
<v Speaker 1>escapes from the category.</v>

159
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.980
<v Speaker 1>And that happens most interpersonal relationships because people are so damn</v>

160
00:06:03.981 --> 00:06:04.670
<v Speaker 1>complicated,</v>

161
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:06.350
<v Speaker 1>you get them figured out and box in.</v>

162
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.660
<v Speaker 1>You even make a contract that neither review,</v>

163
00:06:08.661 --> 00:06:10.280
<v Speaker 1>we'll jump outside the box,</v>

164
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.740
<v Speaker 1>but you jump outside the box continually.</v>

165
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:16.190
<v Speaker 1>And that's why a relationship requires constant negotiation and</v>

166
00:06:16.191 --> 00:06:20.990
<v Speaker 1>reconceptualization because you do not exhaust the person with your perceptual</v>

167
00:06:20.991 --> 00:06:21.824
<v Speaker 1>categories.</v>

168
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.000
<v Speaker 1>And of course you don't exhaust the world with your perceptual categories ever.</v>

169
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:28.340
<v Speaker 1>This is partly why the existentialists,</v>

170
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.100
<v Speaker 1>they have this concept called alienation.</v>

171
00:06:31.101 --> 00:06:34.160
<v Speaker 1>And the idea was that human beings become alienated from their creative</v>

172
00:06:34.161 --> 00:06:34.994
<v Speaker 1>products.</v>

173
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:35.631
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

174
00:06:35.631 --> 00:06:36.770
<v Speaker 1>and that is,</v>

175
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:37.850
<v Speaker 1>and here's why it happens.</v>

176
00:06:37.851 --> 00:06:42.080
<v Speaker 1>So imagine a Henry Ford makes the assembly line,</v>

177
00:06:42.081 --> 00:06:42.291
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

178
00:06:42.291 --> 00:06:42.721
<v Speaker 1>So four,</v>

179
00:06:42.721 --> 00:06:45.710
<v Speaker 1>it has no idea what's going to happen when he makes the assembly line.</v>

180
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:46.250
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

181
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.490
<v Speaker 1>cause he's just trying to figure out a fast way to make cars or he thinks that</v>

182
00:06:49.491 --> 00:06:50.570
<v Speaker 1>what he's making his cars.</v>

183
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.380
<v Speaker 1>So he thinks he's making an assembly line for cars and he thinks he's making</v>

184
00:06:54.381 --> 00:06:55.214
<v Speaker 1>cars.</v>

185
00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:56.061
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>

186
00:06:56.061 --> 00:06:57.230
<v Speaker 1>well what's wrong with that?</v>

187
00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:58.041
<v Speaker 1>Well first of all,</v>

188
00:06:58.041 --> 00:07:01.340
<v Speaker 1>the assembly line absolutely transformed the entire planet,</v>

189
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:02.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

190
00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:03.013
<v Speaker 1>Because it,</v>

191
00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.530
<v Speaker 1>it brought in the era of mass cheap manufacturing.</v>

192
00:07:06.531 --> 00:07:07.364
<v Speaker 1>It's like it just,</v>

193
00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.280
<v Speaker 1>it was way more than he thought it was.</v>

194
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.950
<v Speaker 1>And then did he make a car?</v>

195
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.371
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

196
00:07:13.371 --> 00:07:17.030
<v Speaker 1>a car is something that hypothetically takes you relatively effectively from</v>

197
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:18.380
<v Speaker 1>point a to point B.</v>

198
00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.960
<v Speaker 1>It was really a replacement for the horse and buggy.</v>

199
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:22.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean they,</v>

200
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:24.650
<v Speaker 1>the first cars looked like that they were horseless carriages.</v>

201
00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:25.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

202
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.230
<v Speaker 1>did he make a car while God,</v>

203
00:07:27.231 --> 00:07:27.801
<v Speaker 1>it's God,</v>

204
00:07:27.801 --> 00:07:29.690
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to tell what Henry Ford made.</v>

205
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.080
<v Speaker 1>He made a very effective way for transforming the atmosphere.</v>

206
00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:34.281
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

207
00:07:34.281 --> 00:07:37.250
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that it also happened to take you from point a to point B might be</v>

208
00:07:37.251 --> 00:07:41.240
<v Speaker 1>just completely irrelevant compared to the fact that it was the internal</v>

209
00:07:41.241 --> 00:07:45.680
<v Speaker 1>combustion engine and its rapid distribution completely changed the constituent,</v>

210
00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:45.970
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

211
00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:46.311
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

212
00:07:46.311 --> 00:07:46.700
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

213
00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:50.210
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental chemical structure of the atmosphere itself.</v>

214
00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.370
<v Speaker 1>It completely transformed cities.</v>

215
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:54.470
<v Speaker 1>It blew out the rural community.</v>

216
00:07:54.471 --> 00:07:55.730
<v Speaker 1>Everyone moved to the cities,</v>

217
00:07:55.731 --> 00:07:56.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

218
00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:59.360
<v Speaker 1>It made all the cities built around the automobile.</v>

219
00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:03.170
<v Speaker 1>But then it had this tremendous political and economic significance too.</v>

220
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:03.981
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>

221
00:08:03.981 --> 00:08:08.780
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason that because you think well is a car is a way to get from</v>

222
00:08:08.781 --> 00:08:09.680
<v Speaker 1>point a to point B.</v>

223
00:08:09.681 --> 00:08:10.091
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

224
00:08:10.091 --> 00:08:10.371
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

225
00:08:10.371 --> 00:08:11.360
<v Speaker 1>it's not a machine.</v>

226
00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.760
<v Speaker 1>It's also the abolishment of an idea.</v>

227
00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:15.320
<v Speaker 1>And it's a very strange idea.</v>

228
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:19.640
<v Speaker 1>A collectivist society would have never invented the car because the car is</v>

229
00:08:19.641 --> 00:08:24.641
<v Speaker 1>predicated on the idea that you could own a conveyance that would get only you</v>

230
00:08:24.651 --> 00:08:28.460
<v Speaker 1>and only you from somewhere to somewhere else without ever asking anybody for</v>

231
00:08:28.461 --> 00:08:29.720
<v Speaker 1>any permission.</v>

232
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:33.290
<v Speaker 1>And so the funny thing is is when you build something like that,</v>

233
00:08:33.291 --> 00:08:35.150
<v Speaker 1>those presuppositions are built into it.</v>

234
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.630
<v Speaker 1>And then when you export that say to Soviet Russia,</v>

235
00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:39.650
<v Speaker 1>you don't get to,</v>

236
00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:44.300
<v Speaker 1>they can't just take the car and leave the political implications behind the</v>

237
00:08:44.301 --> 00:08:44.721
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>

238
00:08:44.721 --> 00:08:49.340
<v Speaker 1>The mere fact that you step into one and drive it is an indication that you're</v>

239
00:08:49.341 --> 00:08:50.960
<v Speaker 1>accepting the political,</v>

240
00:08:50.961 --> 00:08:55.961
<v Speaker 1>ideological presuppositions that are part of the fact that thing even exists.</v>

241
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:58.470
<v Speaker 1>And so well that's alienation.</v>

242
00:08:58.471 --> 00:09:01.290
<v Speaker 1>It's like even something you make,</v>

243
00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:01.621
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

244
00:09:01.621 --> 00:09:04.920
<v Speaker 1>well you have control over what you make because you've made it,</v>

245
00:09:04.921 --> 00:09:05.820
<v Speaker 1>you understand.</v>

246
00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:06.720
<v Speaker 1>It's like no you don't.</v>

247
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.670
<v Speaker 1>You understand a tiny fraction of it.</v>

248
00:09:08.671 --> 00:09:09.630
<v Speaker 1>You launch it out in the world,</v>

249
00:09:09.631 --> 00:09:09.841
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

250
00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:11.610
<v Speaker 1>and the snakes inside of it,</v>

251
00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:15.600
<v Speaker 1>the hydrogen high inside of it multiplied their heads massively,</v>

252
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:19.110
<v Speaker 1>constantly and you and you and you can't really keep track of it.</v>

253
00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:20.483
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

254
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.390
<v Speaker 1>so even even in your relationship with created entities,</v>

255
00:09:24.391 --> 00:09:28.530
<v Speaker 1>you still see the reemergence of this underlying fundamental substructure,</v>

256
00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:29.220
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

257
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.120
<v Speaker 1>Even inside,</v>

258
00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:30.601
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>

259
00:09:30.601 --> 00:09:31.650
<v Speaker 1>it's the garden of Eden.</v>

260
00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.180
<v Speaker 1>There's always a snake inside.</v>

261
00:09:33.181 --> 00:09:34.980
<v Speaker 1>The thing that's walled in always,</v>

262
00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:35.461
<v Speaker 1>always,</v>

263
00:09:35.461 --> 00:09:35.880
<v Speaker 1>always.</v>

264
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.030
<v Speaker 1>Even God himself cannot get rid of the snakes in the garden.</v>

265
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:40.950
<v Speaker 1>And partly what that means is that,</v>

266
00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:41.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

267
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.500
<v Speaker 1>the garden is a conceptual system.</v>

268
00:09:43.501 --> 00:09:46.440
<v Speaker 1>It's the conceptual system within which people exist.</v>

269
00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.580
<v Speaker 1>That's Eden is a,</v>

270
00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:48.900
<v Speaker 1>is a walled garden.</v>

271
00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:50.790
<v Speaker 1>Paradise means walled garden,</v>

272
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:53.970
<v Speaker 1>and it's walled because a walled garden is where people live.</v>

273
00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.390
<v Speaker 1>Because the wall is culture and the garden is natured.</v>

274
00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.240
<v Speaker 1>We always live in a structure that's an amalgam of nature and culture.</v>

275
00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:04.080
<v Speaker 1>So we set it up so it's paradise as long as we're unconscious,</v>

276
00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:07.530
<v Speaker 1>but we can't manage it because there's always something chaotic that's coming in</v>

277
00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.030
<v Speaker 1>that we will interact with.</v>

278
00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:10.290
<v Speaker 1>That's human beings.</v>

279
00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.610
<v Speaker 1>You put a snake in the garden.</v>

280
00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:13.290
<v Speaker 1>It's the first bloody thing we're going to talk to.</v>

281
00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:14.730
<v Speaker 1>And for better or worse,</v>

282
00:10:14.731 --> 00:10:16.770
<v Speaker 1>it makes us conscious and awake.</v>

283
00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:18.720
<v Speaker 1>It makes us aware of our mortality.</v>

284
00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:20.940
<v Speaker 1>It does all sorts of terrible things to us,</v>

285
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.800
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't matter because that's,</v>

286
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.020
<v Speaker 1>that's the path that human beings have.</v>

287
00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.040
<v Speaker 1>What chosen,</v>

288
00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:28.680
<v Speaker 1>because that's the implication in that story.</v>

289
00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:29.190
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

290
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:29.591
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

291
00:10:29.591 --> 00:10:30.660
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult.</v>

292
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:35.750
<v Speaker 1>It's a very difficult thing to answer because we certainly choose each other for</v>

293
00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:39.030
<v Speaker 1>self awareness and consciousness and intelligence.</v>

294
00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:39.991
<v Speaker 1>And I don't,</v>

295
00:10:39.991 --> 00:10:40.261
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

296
00:10:40.261 --> 00:10:40.591
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

297
00:10:40.591 --> 00:10:41.880
<v Speaker 1>if you're choosing a mate,</v>

298
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:45.090
<v Speaker 1>there's an arms race in human beings.</v>

299
00:10:45.091 --> 00:10:48.840
<v Speaker 1>We're choosing intelligent mates especially that's especially the case for women</v>

300
00:10:48.841 --> 00:10:49.920
<v Speaker 1>in relationship to men.</v>

301
00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:50.960
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

302
00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:51.793
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

303
00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:53.343
<v Speaker 1>so that,</v>

304
00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.900
<v Speaker 1>the idea that that's a choice,</v>

305
00:10:54.901 --> 00:10:57.930
<v Speaker 1>well that's partly why it's eve that makes that himself conscious in the garden</v>

306
00:10:57.931 --> 00:10:58.291
<v Speaker 1>of Eden,</v>

307
00:10:58.291 --> 00:10:58.471
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

308
00:10:58.471 --> 00:10:59.640
<v Speaker 1>She offers him the apple.</v>

309
00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:01.680
<v Speaker 1>She's the one that makes him self conscious.</v>

310
00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:05.280
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's actually accurate because the evidence from the evolutionary</v>

311
00:11:05.281 --> 00:11:09.930
<v Speaker 1>biologist is that human sexuals female sexual selection was one of the driving</v>

312
00:11:09.931 --> 00:11:12.120
<v Speaker 1>factors that differentiated us from chimpanzees.</v>

313
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.800
<v Speaker 1>It's a major factor.</v>

314
00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.830
<v Speaker 1>Chimpanzee females are not selective maters.</v>

315
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:18.300
<v Speaker 1>They go into estrus,</v>

316
00:11:18.301 --> 00:11:19.230
<v Speaker 1>they'll mate with anything.</v>

317
00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:24.060
<v Speaker 1>What happens is the dominant males chase the subordinate males away and so they</v>

318
00:11:24.061 --> 00:11:25.290
<v Speaker 1>end up leaving more offspring.</v>

319
00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:28.320
<v Speaker 1>But it's not a consequence of selection on the part of the females in human</v>

320
00:11:28.321 --> 00:11:28.651
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>

321
00:11:28.651 --> 00:11:29.790
<v Speaker 1>It's completely different.</v>

322
00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:34.380
<v Speaker 1>Concealed ovulation and intense selection pressure from women on men.</v>

323
00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:37.590
<v Speaker 1>You have twice as many female ancestors as you have male ancestors,</v>

324
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:40.830
<v Speaker 1>and people can never have have a hard time working that out.</v>

325
00:11:40.831 --> 00:11:43.560
<v Speaker 1>Arithmetically but it's not that problematic.</v>

326
00:11:43.561 --> 00:11:44.550
<v Speaker 1>You just think on average,</v>

327
00:11:44.551 --> 00:11:46.680
<v Speaker 1>every woman had one child,</v>

328
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:48.720
<v Speaker 1>half of men had none,</v>

329
00:11:48.721 --> 00:11:49.890
<v Speaker 1>and the other half had to,</v>

330
00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.010
<v Speaker 1>and that's approximately correct.</v>

331
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:56.470
<v Speaker 1>You average across the entire history of human sexuality.</v>

332
00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:00.520
<v Speaker 1>So human males in particular are subject to a vicious selection,</v>

333
00:12:00.521 --> 00:12:02.230
<v Speaker 1>pressure on the part of females.</v>

334
00:12:02.231 --> 00:12:07.231
<v Speaker 1>And I also think that's partly why nature is represented symbolically as female</v>

335
00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:09.640
<v Speaker 1>among human beings.</v>

336
00:12:09.641 --> 00:12:10.930
<v Speaker 1>Because after all,</v>

337
00:12:10.931 --> 00:12:12.490
<v Speaker 1>nature is what selects.</v>

338
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:16.780
<v Speaker 1>There's no better definition of nature then that which selects.</v>
