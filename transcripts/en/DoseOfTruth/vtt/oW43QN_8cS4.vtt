1
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.790
<v Speaker 1>Books we read to our young children.</v>

3
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:10.751
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4
00:00:10.751 --> 00:00:11.830
<v Speaker 1>it depends on how young,</v>

5
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:13.451
<v Speaker 1>really young.</v>

6
00:00:13.451 --> 00:00:16.780
<v Speaker 1>There's this book called how to teach your child to read in a hundred easy</v>

7
00:00:16.781 --> 00:00:17.231
<v Speaker 1>lessons,</v>

8
00:00:17.231 --> 00:00:18.100
<v Speaker 1>all type that.</v>

9
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.913
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

10
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:25.753
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

11
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:27.121
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

12
00:00:27.121 --> 00:00:28.530
<v Speaker 1>I've done something technical.</v>

13
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.770
<v Speaker 1>It's called how to teach.</v>

14
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.101
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

15
00:00:41.101 --> 00:00:46.101
<v Speaker 1>something technically poor your child to read in 100 easy lessons.</v>

16
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.560
<v Speaker 1>That is an excellent book because you can actually teach your child to read in a</v>

17
00:00:53.561 --> 00:00:54.391
<v Speaker 1>hundred easy lessons.</v>

18
00:00:54.391 --> 00:00:55.171
<v Speaker 1>Very smart,</v>

19
00:00:55.171 --> 00:00:55.560
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

20
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.341
<v Speaker 1>very smart book.</v>

21
00:00:56.341 --> 00:00:59.190
<v Speaker 1>Very well developed psychologically older kids.</v>

22
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.810
<v Speaker 1>I really liked the Harry Potter books.</v>

23
00:01:00.811 --> 00:01:04.200
<v Speaker 1>I think that rolling nailed the mythological structure.</v>

24
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:05.423
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

25
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.600
<v Speaker 1>what else?</v>

26
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

27
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm in collaboration with my daughter.</v>

28
00:01:09.091 --> 00:01:11.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm putting together a reading list for young people for,</v>

29
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.170
<v Speaker 1>for kids and young adults.</v>

30
00:01:13.171 --> 00:01:15.600
<v Speaker 1>So I guess I'll have to answer it that way.</v>

31
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:16.623
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

32
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.980
<v Speaker 1>I can't bring it to mind and I can't bring it to mind.</v>
