1
00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:07.293
<v Speaker 1>Sure</v>

2
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.870
<v Speaker 2>you often give advice to young adults to help them avoid some of the pitfalls of</v>

3
00:00:10.871 --> 00:00:11.380
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

4
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.620
<v Speaker 2>Any advice for those of us who are 40 plus who have already faltered?</v>

5
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.530
<v Speaker 2>Look first I'm,</v>

6
00:00:17.531 --> 00:00:18.364
<v Speaker 2>this is Graham.</v>

7
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.320
<v Speaker 2>Everybody who 40 pluses as already fault her,</v>

8
00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:22.030
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

9
00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:26.680
<v Speaker 2>but I'm presuming that you mean faltered in a manner that it appears to you to</v>

10
00:00:26.681 --> 00:00:28.450
<v Speaker 2>be above out above the average.</v>

11
00:00:28.451 --> 00:00:29.050
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

12
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.883
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

13
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.080
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

14
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.720
<v Speaker 2>What I would really recommend is I think that you should,</v>

15
00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:34.590
<v Speaker 2>if you haven't already,</v>

16
00:00:34.591 --> 00:00:37.410
<v Speaker 2>you should go do the future authoring program and maybe the past authoring</v>

17
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.101
<v Speaker 2>program too,</v>

18
00:00:38.101 --> 00:00:42.060
<v Speaker 2>because you should figure out exactly how you faltered.</v>

19
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.430
<v Speaker 2>Like what exactly did you do wrong by your own buy your own analysis,</v>

20
00:00:47.431 --> 00:00:47.641
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

21
00:00:47.641 --> 00:00:48.271
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying,</v>

22
00:00:48.271 --> 00:00:50.310
<v Speaker 2>well what social rules did you break?</v>

23
00:00:50.311 --> 00:00:52.200
<v Speaker 2>Although that's not a bad initial guideline.</v>

24
00:00:52.201 --> 00:00:52.800
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

25
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.290
<v Speaker 2>so in the self authoring suite,</v>

26
00:00:55.291 --> 00:00:59.520
<v Speaker 2>there's a past authoring module and it asks you to break your life I to 70 parks</v>

27
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.050
<v Speaker 2>and then to consider the emotionally significant or practically significant</v>

28
00:01:04.051 --> 00:01:06.600
<v Speaker 2>events within each epoch in the detail out there,</v>

29
00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:08.850
<v Speaker 2>emotional nature and their consequences and so on.</v>

30
00:01:08.851 --> 00:01:11.220
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things you might want to figure out is,</v>

31
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.611
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

32
00:01:11.611 --> 00:01:13.200
<v Speaker 2>when you say that you faltered,</v>

33
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.420
<v Speaker 2>like what do you mean exactly?</v>

34
00:01:15.421 --> 00:01:19.590
<v Speaker 2>And I mean exactly go over your life with a fine tooth comb.</v>

35
00:01:19.591 --> 00:01:22.020
<v Speaker 2>This is what Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn did by the way,</v>

36
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.690
<v Speaker 2>in the Gulag before he wrote the Gulag archipelago,</v>

37
00:01:24.691 --> 00:01:25.950
<v Speaker 2>he went over his life and said,</v>

38
00:01:25.951 --> 00:01:26.221
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

39
00:01:26.221 --> 00:01:28.500
<v Speaker 2>well like where did I go wrong?</v>

40
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:29.820
<v Speaker 2>What did I squander?</v>

41
00:01:29.821 --> 00:01:34.080
<v Speaker 2>What mistakes did I make and what did I do right so that you can orient yourself</v>

42
00:01:34.081 --> 00:01:35.670
<v Speaker 2>now and then you want to think,</v>

43
00:01:35.671 --> 00:01:38.070
<v Speaker 2>and this is why we built the future authoring program.</v>

44
00:01:38.071 --> 00:01:39.120
<v Speaker 2>Well look,</v>

45
00:01:39.121 --> 00:01:40.740
<v Speaker 2>you got 40 years left man.</v>

46
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.190
<v Speaker 2>So what do you want them to be like?</v>

47
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.500
<v Speaker 2>So what do you want to aim at?</v>

48
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.820
<v Speaker 2>You know at least how are you going to minimize the misery if,</v>

49
00:01:48.821 --> 00:01:49.170
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

50
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.210
<v Speaker 2>if nothing else.</v>

51
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.100
<v Speaker 2>And so you need a plan and then what you need to do is to figure out how to work</v>

52
00:01:55.101 --> 00:01:59.540
<v Speaker 2>day to day so that you incrementally approach that plan.</v>

53
00:01:59.541 --> 00:02:04.541
<v Speaker 2>So I have another chapter in this new book called compare yourself to who you</v>

54
00:02:04.881 --> 00:02:05.541
<v Speaker 2>were yesterday.</v>

55
00:02:05.541 --> 00:02:07.550
<v Speaker 2>Rather than to who someone else's today.</v>

56
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.760
<v Speaker 2>That's really a useful psychological stance for someone who's 30 and over in</v>

57
00:02:13.521 --> 00:02:17.360
<v Speaker 2>particular to a 20 year olds can still kind of compare themselves to other 20</v>

58
00:02:17.361 --> 00:02:20.090
<v Speaker 2>year olds because all 20 year olds in some way are the same,</v>

59
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.840
<v Speaker 2>but 40 year olds are really different from each other and so,</v>

60
00:02:22.841 --> 00:02:24.170
<v Speaker 2>or 30 year olds for that matter.</v>

61
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.880
<v Speaker 2>So you might think,</v>

62
00:02:25.881 --> 00:02:26.181
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

63
00:02:26.181 --> 00:02:27.014
<v Speaker 2>well</v>

64
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.040
<v Speaker 2>ear,</v>

65
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.461
<v Speaker 2>here's a,</v>

66
00:02:29.461 --> 00:02:33.120
<v Speaker 2>here's a meditative strategy for for ceasing to falter.</v>

67
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.300
<v Speaker 2>You could wake up in the morning or you could do this at night before you go to</v>

68
00:02:36.301 --> 00:02:37.111
<v Speaker 2>bed and you could think,</v>

69
00:02:37.111 --> 00:02:37.381
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

70
00:02:37.381 --> 00:02:37.950
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

71
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.130
<v Speaker 2>I want to structure my day tomorrow so that when I,</v>

72
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.340
<v Speaker 2>when I'm done with the day,</v>

73
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.880
<v Speaker 2>my life is in slightly better order than it was when I woke up this morning.</v>

74
00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.810
<v Speaker 2>Just slightly better because incremental progress is massively,</v>

75
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.500
<v Speaker 2>massively effective because it bears a exponential fruit.</v>

76
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.390
<v Speaker 2>I just like a bank account,</v>

77
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.590
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

78
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:03.460
<v Speaker 2>compounds,</v>

79
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.220
<v Speaker 2>incremental progress compounds with time.</v>

80
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.170
<v Speaker 2>So you can get up in the morning and you could think,</v>

81
00:03:08.171 --> 00:03:08.650
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

82
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.740
<v Speaker 2>there's some things in my life that I could put in order today.</v>

83
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.210
<v Speaker 2>They're usually things you don't want to do.</v>

84
00:03:13.211 --> 00:03:14.170
<v Speaker 2>As I mentioned earlier,</v>

85
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.440
<v Speaker 2>what could I do today that would help put my life in order that I wouldn't do?</v>

86
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.150
<v Speaker 2>And you have to ask yourself.</v>

87
00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:23.110
<v Speaker 2>You can't tell yourself.</v>

88
00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:25.420
<v Speaker 2>You have to ask yourself what would you do?</v>

89
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.800
<v Speaker 2>And then maybe you have to say,</v>

90
00:03:26.801 --> 00:03:27.340
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

91
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.820
<v Speaker 2>or maybe you have to say under what conditions would I be willing to do</v>

92
00:03:30.821 --> 00:03:33.550
<v Speaker 2>something to put my life in further ordered today?</v>

93
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.740
<v Speaker 2>What little reward would I need to give myself?</v>

94
00:03:35.741 --> 00:03:39.490
<v Speaker 2>And these have to be questions you can't like take out the whip and boss</v>

95
00:03:39.491 --> 00:03:42.540
<v Speaker 2>yourself wrong because you'll find that you're a terrible master and a worst</v>

96
00:03:42.541 --> 00:03:43.374
<v Speaker 2>slave.</v>

97
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.440
<v Speaker 2>And so you can get a long ways if you look low enough.</v>

98
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.270
<v Speaker 2>One of the things Carl Jung said,</v>

99
00:03:49.271 --> 00:03:52.390
<v Speaker 2>which I really liked was that modern people don't see God because they don't</v>

100
00:03:52.391 --> 00:03:53.201
<v Speaker 2>look low enough.</v>

101
00:03:53.201 --> 00:03:54.370
<v Speaker 2>They don't have the humility.</v>

102
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.830
<v Speaker 2>Now you said that you have already faulted.</v>

103
00:03:56.831 --> 00:03:59.960
<v Speaker 2>So it sounds like you've got to humility already intact.</v>

104
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.040
<v Speaker 2>So I would say think about what you want.</v>

105
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.330
<v Speaker 2>Think about what you know around you isn't set right.</v>

106
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.820
<v Speaker 2>Cause you'll know it.</v>

107
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.770
<v Speaker 2>Make a list of things that are around you that aren't right.</v>

108
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.130
<v Speaker 2>And then start thinking about small things you can do,</v>

109
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.600
<v Speaker 2>like trivial things that even a fool like yourself could manage that would</v>

110
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.830
<v Speaker 2>orient you in the right direction and help straighten out your life and try that</v>

111
00:04:23.831 --> 00:04:26.110
<v Speaker 2>for a year before you decide that you're a failure.</v>

112
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:27.003
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

113
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.010
<v Speaker 2>Because you'll find that if you put that into practice for a year,</v>

114
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.170
<v Speaker 2>that things will be a lot better.</v>

115
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.160
<v Speaker 2>And like I said,</v>

116
00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:34.300
<v Speaker 2>you got 40 years left,</v>

117
00:04:34.301 --> 00:04:34.900
<v Speaker 2>so you're not,</v>

118
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:35.830
<v Speaker 2>you're not done yet.</v>

119
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.180
<v Speaker 2>And so</v>

120
00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.280
<v Speaker 2>the other thing I would say too is</v>

121
00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:43.310
<v Speaker 2>it isn't exactly that.</v>

122
00:04:43.311 --> 00:04:45.530
<v Speaker 2>I would say forgive yourself because you know,</v>

123
00:04:45.531 --> 00:04:46.550
<v Speaker 2>that's just a cliche.</v>

124
00:04:46.551 --> 00:04:49.010
<v Speaker 2>But I would say that once you've decided,</v>

125
00:04:49.011 --> 00:04:49.490
<v Speaker 2>once you,</v>

126
00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.420
<v Speaker 2>what you've done wrong and you've put into practice some,</v>

127
00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.000
<v Speaker 2>some strategies to rectify that,</v>

128
00:04:56.001 --> 00:04:57.350
<v Speaker 2>that don't,</v>

129
00:04:57.351 --> 00:05:01.550
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to beat yourself any more than is necessary for you to learn,</v>

130
00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.630
<v Speaker 2>which is a good rule of thumb with regards to treating yourself and also to</v>

131
00:05:05.631 --> 00:05:06.620
<v Speaker 2>treating other people.</v>

132
00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.173
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

133
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.330
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
