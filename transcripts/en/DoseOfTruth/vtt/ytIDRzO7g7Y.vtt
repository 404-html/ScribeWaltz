1
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.270
<v Speaker 1>Listen carefully to your teen and a lecture,</v>

2
00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.270
<v Speaker 1>but waves of contempt for existence itself.</v>

3
00:00:13.271 --> 00:00:13.540
<v Speaker 1>Teak.</v>

4
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.070
<v Speaker 1>Tell me there's a part of me that rebels and riding these waves waves,</v>

5
00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.460
<v Speaker 1>but can I harness them for good God,</v>

6
00:00:21.461 --> 00:00:21.971
<v Speaker 1>you guys,</v>

7
00:00:21.971 --> 00:00:23.620
<v Speaker 1>you ask the hardest questions.</v>

8
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.030
<v Speaker 1>Waves of contempt of exists for existence itself.</v>

9
00:00:28.031 --> 00:00:28.864
<v Speaker 1>Keep coming.</v>

10
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.931
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

11
00:00:36.931 --> 00:00:38.520
<v Speaker 1>I guess what I would say is</v>

12
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.500
<v Speaker 1>it's probably time for a little bit of individual psychoanalysis and I don't</v>

13
00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.470
<v Speaker 1>necessarily mean that you have to go and find a therapist.</v>

14
00:00:53.471 --> 00:00:54.304
<v Speaker 1>I would say</v>

15
00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.020
<v Speaker 1>you're generalizing,</v>

16
00:00:58.021 --> 00:00:58.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.650
<v Speaker 1>you say waves of contempt for existence itself keep coming,</v>

18
00:01:01.651 --> 00:01:05.670
<v Speaker 1>but I don't believe that that's exactly right and I'm certainly not accusing you</v>

19
00:01:05.671 --> 00:01:06.570
<v Speaker 1>of being deceitful.</v>

20
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.230
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

21
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.790
<v Speaker 1>it's more like low resolution.</v>

22
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.640
<v Speaker 1>My suspicions are is that there's a set of experiences that you've had that are</v>

23
00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:16.740
<v Speaker 1>characteristic to your own personal life,</v>

24
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.170
<v Speaker 1>that have caused you to do,</v>

25
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.120
<v Speaker 1>caused you some bitterness and some resentment and that those haven't been</v>

26
00:01:24.121 --> 00:01:24.900
<v Speaker 1>thought through.</v>

27
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.490
<v Speaker 1>And usually thinking through means at least in some part,</v>

28
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.190
<v Speaker 1>trying to take as much responsibility for those,</v>

29
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.300
<v Speaker 1>for altering the conditions under which those things happen going forward into</v>

30
00:01:36.301 --> 00:01:37.500
<v Speaker 1>the future as possible.</v>

31
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.240
<v Speaker 1>Like the purpose of memory is to stop you from doing the same stupid things in</v>

32
00:01:42.241 --> 00:01:42.780
<v Speaker 1>the future,</v>

33
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

34
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.310
<v Speaker 1>That that's the purpose.</v>

35
00:01:44.311 --> 00:01:49.170
<v Speaker 1>And so if you've had experiences that have made you bitter and resentful or are</v>

36
00:01:49.171 --> 00:01:51.870
<v Speaker 1>still engaged in experiences that are doing that,</v>

37
00:01:51.871 --> 00:01:56.010
<v Speaker 1>then you need to do a careful micro analysis of what those are and see if you</v>

38
00:01:56.011 --> 00:01:59.190
<v Speaker 1>can see if you can flip your attitude in some matter.</v>

39
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.053
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

40
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying this is easy,</v>

41
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.700
<v Speaker 1>but the first thing you can do is at least figure out what those memories are.</v>

42
00:02:05.701 --> 00:02:10.701
<v Speaker 1>And I might recommend trying to past Autherine program because what the past</v>

43
00:02:11.671 --> 00:02:16.320
<v Speaker 1>offering program does is ask you to break your life up into six he parks and</v>

44
00:02:16.321 --> 00:02:21.321
<v Speaker 1>then to identify the emotionally significant occurrences during each of those</v>

45
00:02:21.421 --> 00:02:22.021
<v Speaker 1>epochs.</v>

46
00:02:22.021 --> 00:02:26.370
<v Speaker 1>And you can kind of tell if something needs work from a memory perspective,</v>

47
00:02:26.371 --> 00:02:26.790
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

48
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.250
<v Speaker 1>if it occurred more than about 18 months ago.</v>

49
00:02:29.251 --> 00:02:30.960
<v Speaker 1>And when you remember it,</v>

50
00:02:30.961 --> 00:02:35.760
<v Speaker 1>it still causes like a wave of sadness or anger or really any kind of negative</v>

51
00:02:35.761 --> 00:02:39.930
<v Speaker 1>emotion because what that means is that your brain is still targeting that</v>

52
00:02:39.931 --> 00:02:44.931
<v Speaker 1>experience as threatening and unexplored and what that means is that in some</v>

53
00:02:45.241 --> 00:02:45.541
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>

54
00:02:45.541 --> 00:02:49.590
<v Speaker 1>part of you or a part of the that could exist is still stuck in that memory</v>

55
00:02:49.591 --> 00:02:54.591
<v Speaker 1>because you can go back and do a careful causal analysis of the events that led</v>

56
00:02:55.051 --> 00:03:00.051
<v Speaker 1>up to the unfortunate circumstance and try to map out your role.</v>

57
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.470
<v Speaker 1>Even if your role is minor,</v>

58
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.890
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be things that you could have done differently to avoid it and</v>

59
00:03:05.891 --> 00:03:07.690
<v Speaker 1>that's what you need to figure out for the future.</v>

60
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.910
<v Speaker 1>I would say you try to shed all your personal resentment.</v>

61
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.780
<v Speaker 1>A part of that too is to not not take things too personally.</v>

62
00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:17.081
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

63
00:03:17.081 --> 00:03:21.490
<v Speaker 1>like one of the advantages of developing what I would regard as a mythologically</v>

64
00:03:21.491 --> 00:03:25.000
<v Speaker 1>centered view of the cosmos is that you understand that</v>

65
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:27.660
<v Speaker 1>the reason there's,</v>

66
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.880
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing personal about the fact that terrible things happen to you.</v>

67
00:03:30.881 --> 00:03:31.121
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

68
00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:34.510
<v Speaker 1>unless you're directly causally involved as as it says,</v>

69
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.220
<v Speaker 1>I believe in the Old Testament rains on the just and the unjust delight.</v>

70
00:03:38.221 --> 00:03:39.490
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

71
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.420
<v Speaker 1>there there are,</v>

72
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.370
<v Speaker 1>this is an existentialist motif.</v>

73
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.470
<v Speaker 1>The tragedy and difficulty and even the confrontation with evil are built into</v>

74
00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:48.850
<v Speaker 1>the structure of existence.</v>

75
00:03:48.851 --> 00:03:52.010
<v Speaker 1>And it's not aimed at you personally and it,</v>

76
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:53.051
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

77
00:03:53.051 --> 00:03:53.621
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

78
00:03:53.621 --> 00:03:56.290
<v Speaker 1>it may be the price that we pay for existence itself.</v>

79
00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:57.161
<v Speaker 1>You could say,</v>

80
00:03:57.161 --> 00:03:58.990
<v Speaker 1>well that price is too high to pay,</v>

81
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.930
<v Speaker 1>but well,</v>

82
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.833
<v Speaker 1>as I mentioned,</v>

83
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.190
<v Speaker 1>if you start taking that way,</v>

84
00:04:03.191 --> 00:04:04.330
<v Speaker 1>then you make everything much,</v>

85
00:04:04.331 --> 00:04:05.164
<v Speaker 1>much worse.</v>

86
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.530
<v Speaker 1>It seems better to shoulder you're cross voluntarily and stumble forward towards</v>

87
00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:12.010
<v Speaker 1>the light.</v>

88
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.820
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

89
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.140
<v Speaker 1>that's the best strategy.</v>

90
00:04:14.141 --> 00:04:17.420
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that that just because it's the best strategy,</v>

91
00:04:17.421 --> 00:04:20.020
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't even necessarily mean that it's always going to work.</v>

92
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:24.580
<v Speaker 1>Like this is no optimistic scenario like a dragon fight is no optimistic</v>

93
00:04:24.581 --> 00:04:25.414
<v Speaker 1>scenario.</v>

94
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.500
<v Speaker 1>Confront the dragon and get the gold and get the girl and bring it back to co to</v>

95
00:04:29.501 --> 00:04:30.520
<v Speaker 1>share it with the community,</v>

96
00:04:30.521 --> 00:04:31.354
<v Speaker 1>the gold.</v>

97
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.400
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

98
00:04:33.401 --> 00:04:34.630
<v Speaker 1>that sounds all well and good,</v>

99
00:04:34.631 --> 00:04:37.510
<v Speaker 1>but after all it is a dragon and many people get eaten by them.</v>

100
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:38.261
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

101
00:04:38.261 --> 00:04:40.630
<v Speaker 1>but the myth basically says,</v>

102
00:04:40.631 --> 00:04:40.841
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

103
00:04:40.841 --> 00:04:45.670
<v Speaker 1>your best bet is to open your eyes and speak the truth and look forward</v>

104
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.550
<v Speaker 1>forthright and confront the things that are,</v>

105
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:49.540
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

106
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.500
<v Speaker 1>the hydrants that are raising their heads in their tentacles constantly to</v>

107
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.500
<v Speaker 1>frighten you and stop you and to fight the tyranny of,</v>

108
00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.490
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

109
00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.390
<v Speaker 1>of the social structure when,</v>

110
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.270
<v Speaker 1>when it's oppressing you unduly.</v>

111
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:02.643
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

112
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:03.880
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

113
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.500
<v Speaker 1>and that's what you have to do.</v>

114
00:05:05.501 --> 00:05:06.460
<v Speaker 1>But I would say if,</v>

115
00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:08.340
<v Speaker 1>if that contempt is their mountain,</v>

116
00:05:08.341 --> 00:05:11.040
<v Speaker 1>that's really worth digging into because that,</v>

117
00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.640
<v Speaker 1>that would also be the source.</v>

118
00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.030
<v Speaker 1>That would be the place where you discover the union shadow because you would</v>

119
00:05:16.031 --> 00:05:19.690
<v Speaker 1>discover that contempt is an unbelievably destructive force.</v>

120
00:05:19.691 --> 00:05:24.190
<v Speaker 1>Contempt is a particularly destructive force and it would be useful for you to</v>

121
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.300
<v Speaker 1>try to think about,</v>

122
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.980
<v Speaker 1>you can use fantasy to do this.</v>

123
00:05:26.981 --> 00:05:27.281
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

124
00:05:27.281 --> 00:05:27.521
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

125
00:05:27.521 --> 00:05:32.200
<v Speaker 1>if you let that contempt manifest itself fully in like a dream or a daydream</v>

126
00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.840
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

127
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.750
<v Speaker 1>and you let it go on a rampage,</v>

128
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.760
<v Speaker 1>like what,</v>

129
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.450
<v Speaker 1>what's the vision exactly?</v>

130
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:38.081
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

131
00:05:38.081 --> 00:05:39.880
<v Speaker 1>is it the destruction of the town?</v>

132
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:41.760
<v Speaker 1>Is the destruction of the country?</v>

133
00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.570
<v Speaker 1>You want the entire world to blow up?</v>

134
00:05:43.571 --> 00:05:47.320
<v Speaker 1>Like are there specific people that you're angry at or maybe you're angry at</v>

135
00:05:47.321 --> 00:05:47.920
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

136
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.920
<v Speaker 1>like you need to figure out those waves of contempt are unarticulated elements</v>

137
00:05:53.051 --> 00:05:55.660
<v Speaker 1>of experience and they're part of your shadow.</v>

138
00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.760
<v Speaker 1>So can you harness them for good?</v>

139
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:00.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

140
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.350
<v Speaker 1>I think the more you understand your dark urges,</v>

141
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:08.300
<v Speaker 1>the more likely you are to be able to regulate and control the men to use them</v>

142
00:06:08.301 --> 00:06:09.500
<v Speaker 1>as part of your power.</v>

143
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.110
<v Speaker 1>A person or authority,</v>

144
00:06:12.111 --> 00:06:16.760
<v Speaker 1>let's say a person who has authority is someone who's integrated the dangerous</v>

145
00:06:16.761 --> 00:06:17.720
<v Speaker 1>parts of themselves,</v>

146
00:06:17.721 --> 00:06:20.630
<v Speaker 1>and that's part of what gives their words Gravitas and weight.</v>

147
00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:22.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

148
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.060
<v Speaker 1>and so yes,</v>

149
00:06:23.061 --> 00:06:23.840
<v Speaker 1>I think you could,</v>

150
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.100
<v Speaker 1>you could harness them for good.</v>

151
00:06:25.101 --> 00:06:25.934
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

152
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.890
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's the right thing to do,</v>

153
00:06:27.891 --> 00:06:31.550
<v Speaker 1>but it will involve a fair bit and painful soul searching.</v>
