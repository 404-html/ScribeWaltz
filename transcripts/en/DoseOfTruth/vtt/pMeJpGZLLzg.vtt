1
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.930
<v Speaker 1>The fact that people aren't on their knees in gratitude all the time for the</v>

2
00:00:09.931 --> 00:00:12.330
<v Speaker 1>fact that we have central heating and air conditioning and,</v>

3
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.030
<v Speaker 1>and pure water and reliable food.</v>

4
00:00:15.031 --> 00:00:15.864
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

5
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:16.951
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

6
00:00:16.951 --> 00:00:18.540
<v Speaker 2>It's absolutely unbelievable.</v>

7
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.580
<v Speaker 2>And then the water supply was contaminated with cholera for heaven's sakes.</v>

8
00:00:23.581 --> 00:00:23.970
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

9
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:24.840
<v Speaker 2>People don't understand.</v>

10
00:00:24.841 --> 00:00:25.020
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

11
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.280
<v Speaker 2>I've had clean water,</v>

12
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.330
<v Speaker 2>fresh milk,</v>

13
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.290
<v Speaker 2>fresh orange juice,</v>

14
00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:29.001
<v Speaker 2>all of these things.</v>

15
00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:30.570
<v Speaker 2>There's a mom and all of the time,</v>

16
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.260
<v Speaker 2>all the time that that western culture is heading.</v>

17
00:00:34.261 --> 00:00:34.500
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

18
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.730
<v Speaker 2>Become,</v>

19
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.320
<v Speaker 2>because we are so dependent on this,</v>

20
00:00:36.321 --> 00:00:40.320
<v Speaker 2>on this invisible infrastructure where a heading for an absolute catastrophe,</v>

21
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.460
<v Speaker 2>when hardest figure out how to paralyze the power grid,</v>

22
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.880
<v Speaker 2>the entire culture will be chaotic.</v>

23
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.680
<v Speaker 2>You'll have mobs in the street.</v>

24
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:50.210
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

25
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.420
<v Speaker 2>And within three days.</v>

26
00:00:51.421 --> 00:00:51.610
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

27
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.430
<v Speaker 2>When and so suddenly the food supply is interrupted and there's no light.</v>

28
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:54.860
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>

29
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:55.890
<v Speaker 2>no way to communicate.</v>

30
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.050
<v Speaker 2>There'll be like a robbery.</v>

31
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean that that is the way western culture is going to collapse.</v>

32
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.440
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

33
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.050
<v Speaker 2>And it won't take much just just</v>

34
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.720
<v Speaker 2>because we are so interconnected and now we are.</v>

35
00:01:06.721 --> 00:01:07.411
<v Speaker 2>So it's so,</v>

36
00:01:07.411 --> 00:01:11.460
<v Speaker 2>it's so dependent on communications and computers to the eat it.</v>

37
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.730
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

38
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:12.220
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

39
00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.150
<v Speaker 2>I used to predict for years there'll be an asteroid hitting the earth and you</v>

40
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.070
<v Speaker 2>have enough another</v>

41
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.250
<v Speaker 1>the solar flares work.</v>

42
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:19.810
<v Speaker 1>So back in,</v>

43
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.700
<v Speaker 1>this happens about once every century.</v>

44
00:01:21.701 --> 00:01:24.850
<v Speaker 1>So back about 1880 and I don't remember the exact year,</v>

45
00:01:24.851 --> 00:01:27.220
<v Speaker 1>there was a significant enough solar flare,</v>

46
00:01:27.221 --> 00:01:29.440
<v Speaker 1>so that produces an electromagnetic pulse,</v>

47
00:01:29.441 --> 00:01:33.670
<v Speaker 1>like a hydrogen bomb because the sun is a hydrogen bomb and electromagnetic</v>

48
00:01:33.671 --> 00:01:37.810
<v Speaker 1>pulse will emerge from the sun and wave across the earth and it produces huge</v>

49
00:01:37.811 --> 00:01:39.490
<v Speaker 1>spikes in electrical,</v>

50
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:40.211
<v Speaker 1>electrical,</v>

51
00:01:40.211 --> 00:01:43.000
<v Speaker 1>current along anything that's electronic and he'll burn them out.</v>

52
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.560
<v Speaker 1>It led it lip telegraph operators on fire in the 18 hundreds and one of those</v>

53
00:01:47.561 --> 00:01:51.100
<v Speaker 1>things took out the Quebec power grid in 1985 and knocked out the whole</v>

54
00:01:51.101 --> 00:01:52.150
<v Speaker 1>northeast corridor.</v>

55
00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.540
<v Speaker 1>And so you figure those things are about one in a century event,</v>

56
00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:56.703
<v Speaker 1>but those single,</v>

57
00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.290
<v Speaker 1>I have my brother in law who's a very smart guy.</v>

58
00:01:59.291 --> 00:02:01.360
<v Speaker 1>He designed the chip and the iPhone.</v>

59
00:02:01.361 --> 00:02:05.470
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about political issues the last time I went and saw him in San</v>

60
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.471
<v Speaker 1>Francisco.</v>

61
00:02:05.471 --> 00:02:09.350
<v Speaker 1>And his notion was that all that the government should be doing right now is</v>

62
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.790
<v Speaker 1>stress testing our infrastructure the same way they stress test the banks</v>

63
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.700
<v Speaker 1>because we're so full of these single points of failure that,</v>

64
00:02:15.701 --> 00:02:17.050
<v Speaker 1>and I think you're absolutely right.</v>

65
00:02:17.051 --> 00:02:18.010
<v Speaker 1>Luckily we've been,</v>

66
00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.820
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

67
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:19.750
<v Speaker 1>what would you call,</v>

68
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.050
<v Speaker 1>invaded by stupid terrorists instead of smart terrorists?</v>

69
00:02:23.051 --> 00:02:26.950
<v Speaker 1>Because a smart terrorist could do an unbelievable amount of damage in a very</v>

70
00:02:26.951 --> 00:02:28.030
<v Speaker 1>short period of time.</v>

71
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.810
<v Speaker 1>So when it's just God's good graces that that hasn't happened yet.</v>

72
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.830
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

73
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.590
<v Speaker 2>and then what will happen is that if the men,</v>

74
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.020
<v Speaker 2>the men will reconstruct civilization while the women cower in the houses.</v>

75
00:02:41.021 --> 00:02:43.120
<v Speaker 2>And I have the men go out and do all the dirty work.</v>

76
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.200
<v Speaker 2>That's what's going to happen again.</v>

77
00:02:44.201 --> 00:02:45.070
<v Speaker 2>Only men will,</v>

78
00:02:45.071 --> 00:02:46.720
<v Speaker 2>will bring civilization back again.</v>

79
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:47.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
