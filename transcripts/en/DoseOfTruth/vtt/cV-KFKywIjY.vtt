00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.570
<v Speaker 1>How do you use the results in the new personality test for progress in life?</v>

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.890
<v Speaker 1>Try to compensate some sides that that received fewer points.</v>

3
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.473
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.210
<v Speaker 1>at the risk of sounding self serving,</v>

5
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.830
<v Speaker 1>that's actually why we developed the self authoring suite was to help people</v>

6
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.030
<v Speaker 1>improve their,</v>

7
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.160
<v Speaker 1>let's say performance and mental health.</v>

8
00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:22.170
<v Speaker 1>Now we don't have direct evidence that will,</v>

9
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.000
<v Speaker 1>that will improve personality,</v>

10
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.320
<v Speaker 1>but I suspect that that evidence would take a very long time to accumulate.</v>

11
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.930
<v Speaker 1>What we do know is that the self authoring suite,</v>

12
00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:32.640
<v Speaker 1>especially the future authoring suite,</v>

13
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:34.050
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

14
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.070
<v Speaker 1>helps people,</v>

15
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.540
<v Speaker 1>helps university students,</v>

16
00:00:36.541 --> 00:00:37.111
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

17
00:00:37.111 --> 00:00:38.340
<v Speaker 1>stay enrolled in university.</v>

18
00:00:38.341 --> 00:00:42.810
<v Speaker 1>It increases the probability of that by about 25% and increases grade point</v>

19
00:00:42.811 --> 00:00:44.040
<v Speaker 1>average by about the same.</v>

20
00:00:44.041 --> 00:00:49.041
<v Speaker 1>And there's good theoretical reasons for assuming that writing is a good way of,</v>

21
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.200
<v Speaker 1>of um,</v>

22
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.320
<v Speaker 1>as writing about yourself and about your past and about your future is a good</v>

23
00:00:56.371 --> 00:01:00.150
<v Speaker 1>way of catalyzing personality transformation because it appears that</v>

24
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:01.411
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>

25
00:01:01.411 --> 00:01:04.440
<v Speaker 1>the human psyche is organized at the highest level of abstraction.</v>

26
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.440
<v Speaker 1>Using something like self narrative and a well developed narrative makes a frame</v>

27
00:01:10.381 --> 00:01:11.280
<v Speaker 1>for your life and,</v>

28
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.300
<v Speaker 1>and helps you stabilize your negative emotions and also experience more positive</v>

29
00:01:15.301 --> 00:01:19.440
<v Speaker 1>emotion because you only experience positive emotion and relationship to a goal.</v>

30
00:01:19.441 --> 00:01:23.700
<v Speaker 1>And that can make goal directed activity lot more rewarding.</v>

31
00:01:23.701 --> 00:01:24.060
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

32
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.271
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:01:24.271 --> 00:01:29.271
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot easier to engage in activities that aren't intrinsically rewarding if</v>

34
00:01:29.341 --> 00:01:31.650
<v Speaker 1>they're linked to something that you really find important.</v>

35
00:01:31.651 --> 00:01:34.650
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say if you want to work on your personality,</v>

36
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.950
<v Speaker 1>well the first thing you have to do is figure out who it is that you want to be.</v>

37
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.270
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to make a plan and maybe you have to clean up your past as</v>

38
00:01:42.271 --> 00:01:42.571
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

39
00:01:42.571 --> 00:01:44.910
<v Speaker 1>And the self authoring suite was designed,</v>

40
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.661
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:01:45.661 --> 00:01:50.661
<v Speaker 1>quite carefully in order to help people do that with a relative minimum of</v>

42
00:01:50.761 --> 00:01:51.210
<v Speaker 1>effort.</v>

43
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.070
<v Speaker 1>Not that it's easy because it's not,</v>

44
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.090
<v Speaker 1>but a relative minimum minimum of effort compared to other technologies,</v>

45
00:01:57.091 --> 00:01:57.924
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

46
00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.010
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>

47
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.650
<v Speaker 1>like longterm psychotherapy and,</v>

48
00:02:01.651 --> 00:02:02.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

49
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.990
<v Speaker 1>to make it cost effective as well.</v>

50
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.800
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
