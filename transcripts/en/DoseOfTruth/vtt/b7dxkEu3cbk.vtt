00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:00.701
<v Speaker 1>Jordan,</v>

2
00:00:00.701 --> 00:00:01.630
<v Speaker 1>great to chat with you today.</v>

3
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:02.311
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

4
00:00:02.311 --> 00:00:03.570
<v Speaker 2>thanks for the invitation.</v>

5
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:04.331
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6
00:00:04.331 --> 00:00:05.170
<v Speaker 1>As we were saying,</v>

7
00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:06.460
<v Speaker 1>just before we started,</v>

8
00:00:06.461 --> 00:00:08.350
<v Speaker 1>it's nice to finally see you and talk to you.</v>

9
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.650
<v Speaker 1>We've been in touch for a while and published a paper on creativity and I should</v>

10
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:13.840
<v Speaker 1>give you even further context,</v>

11
00:00:13.841 --> 00:00:15.970
<v Speaker 1>which I never gave you when we were actually collaborating,</v>

12
00:00:15.971 --> 00:00:18.190
<v Speaker 1>which is as I was working on my dissertation,</v>

13
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.540
<v Speaker 1>I drove a lot on your work.</v>

14
00:00:20.541 --> 00:00:23.510
<v Speaker 1>I drew a lot on your work on creativity and personality and I thought there'd be</v>

15
00:00:23.511 --> 00:00:25.430
<v Speaker 1>no better place than to start with our discussion.</v>

16
00:00:25.431 --> 00:00:30.431
<v Speaker 1>Then some of that seminal work you have done on creativity and one concept that</v>

17
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.810
<v Speaker 1>really fascinated me in Grad school was the idea of latent inhibition</v>

18
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.943
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

19
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.070
<v Speaker 1>you had done some work on that and had found this really interesting link</v>

20
00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:39.810
<v Speaker 1>between latent inhibition and the personality trait,</v>

21
00:00:39.811 --> 00:00:40.860
<v Speaker 1>openness to experience,</v>

22
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.040
<v Speaker 1>and then you did this,</v>

23
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.570
<v Speaker 1>you did that with Shelly Carson and then you did this work linking it to</v>

24
00:00:45.571 --> 00:00:46.430
<v Speaker 1>creative achievement.</v>

25
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.050
<v Speaker 1>So you could talk a little about what is leading the mission and and how is it</v>

26
00:00:49.051 --> 00:00:49.980
<v Speaker 1>related to creativity?</v>

27
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:51.423
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

28
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.080
<v Speaker 2>a lot of what we learn,</v>

29
00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.691
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

30
00:00:53.691 --> 00:00:55.940
<v Speaker 2>you might think that you learn what things mean.</v>

31
00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.360
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

32
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.960
<v Speaker 2>and there is some truth in that,</v>

33
00:00:57.961 --> 00:00:59.080
<v Speaker 2>but it's more accurate.</v>

34
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.980
<v Speaker 2>Many ways to reverse that,</v>

35
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.420
<v Speaker 2>like reversing so many things in psychology is useful.</v>

36
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.600
<v Speaker 2>It's not that useful to try to figure out why people get addicted,</v>

37
00:01:09.601 --> 00:01:10.261
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

38
00:01:10.261 --> 00:01:13.350
<v Speaker 2>It's very useful to figure out why some people,</v>

39
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.800
<v Speaker 2>but most people aren't addicted all the time.</v>

40
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.570
<v Speaker 2>It's not that difficult to figure out why people are afraid.</v>

41
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.110
<v Speaker 2>What's hard is to understand why people aren't afraid all the time.</v>

42
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.050
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of things in psychology,</v>

43
00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:28.260
<v Speaker 2>we get backwards and we tend to think that we learned the meaning of things,</v>

44
00:01:28.261 --> 00:01:30.850
<v Speaker 2>but that's not exactly true.</v>

45
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.790
<v Speaker 2>It's more reasonable to point out that we learned that things are irrelevant,</v>

46
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.950
<v Speaker 2>they start out meaningful and we learned that there were irrelevant and the</v>

47
00:01:40.951 --> 00:01:44.130
<v Speaker 2>reason for that is that when you first encountered something,</v>

48
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.160
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to assume that it's irrelevant mostly because it might be</v>

49
00:01:48.161 --> 00:01:48.820
<v Speaker 2>dangerous.</v>

50
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.770
<v Speaker 2>Partly also because it might be useful,</v>

51
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.700
<v Speaker 2>but most of the things that we encounter,</v>

52
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.790
<v Speaker 2>proof neither be dangerous nor useful and so that we can safely put them aside</v>

53
00:01:58.491 --> 00:02:02.590
<v Speaker 2>with all the other things that we don't attend to and we don't attend to almost</v>

54
00:02:02.591 --> 00:02:03.424
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>

55
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.490
<v Speaker 2>so learned irrelevance is unbelievably important and latent inhibition is in</v>

56
00:02:08.491 --> 00:02:12.950
<v Speaker 2>some sense a way of measuring how fast someone can make something irrelevant</v>

57
00:02:12.951 --> 00:02:13.784
<v Speaker 2>through learning.</v>

58
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.880
<v Speaker 2>So imagine that something surprises you and you have a big response to it,</v>

59
00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.610
<v Speaker 2>but nothing comes of it and then the next time it pops up,</v>

60
00:02:21.611 --> 00:02:22.720
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't surprise you at all.</v>

61
00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.210
<v Speaker 2>That's basically learning through latent inhibition.</v>

62
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.971
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

63
00:02:25.971 --> 00:02:28.630
<v Speaker 2>one of the things we started to contemplate,</v>

64
00:02:28.631 --> 00:02:30.730
<v Speaker 2>this was back 20 years ago with my student,</v>

65
00:02:30.731 --> 00:02:32.350
<v Speaker 2>Shelly Carson and Daniel Higgins,</v>

66
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.170
<v Speaker 2>was the role that artists play in revivifying perception.</v>

67
00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.450
<v Speaker 2>So if you look at a van Gogh painting of viruses,</v>

68
00:02:40.451 --> 00:02:40.991
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

69
00:02:40.991 --> 00:02:41.741
<v Speaker 2>or sunflowers,</v>

70
00:02:41.741 --> 00:02:46.741
<v Speaker 2>very famous paintings as if the artist makes you recall how those remarkable</v>

71
00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.410
<v Speaker 2>phenomena manifest themselves so that you can see them as if you're seeing them</v>

72
00:02:52.411 --> 00:02:53.540
<v Speaker 2>again for the first time.</v>

73
00:02:53.541 --> 00:02:57.580
<v Speaker 2>And what we thought was that perhaps what the artist was doing was stripping</v>

74
00:02:57.581 --> 00:03:01.880
<v Speaker 2>away your latent inhibition so that you could see things the way you saw them</v>

75
00:03:01.881 --> 00:03:05.930
<v Speaker 2>the first time in all their splendor and glory before you pack them away</v>

76
00:03:05.931 --> 00:03:07.340
<v Speaker 2>conceptually as irrelevant.</v>

77
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.600
<v Speaker 2>And so we tested that with creative people and found that creative people did</v>

78
00:03:11.601 --> 00:03:14.870
<v Speaker 2>have lower latent inhibition and sorted people high in the personality trait.</v>

79
00:03:14.871 --> 00:03:15.704
<v Speaker 2>Openness.</v>

80
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:16.420
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>

81
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.680
<v Speaker 2>I should say that hands.</v>

82
00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.240
<v Speaker 2>Isaac got there first.</v>

83
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.580
<v Speaker 2>Curses soul.</v>

84
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:21.663
<v Speaker 1>It got everywhere.</v>

85
00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.963
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>

86
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.050
<v Speaker 1>William James Williams has got everywhere for us,</v>

87
00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:26.321
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

88
00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:27.310
<v Speaker 1>in terms of personality,</v>

89
00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:28.450
<v Speaker 1>I think got their first yet.</v>

90
00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:29.361
<v Speaker 2>Well will you?</v>

91
00:03:29.361 --> 00:03:29.811
<v Speaker 2>It's funny,</v>

92
00:03:29.811 --> 00:03:33.930
<v Speaker 2>I guess in some sense William James even got there before Isaac because he</v>

93
00:03:33.931 --> 00:03:36.000
<v Speaker 2>played around with nitrous oxide,</v>

94
00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.900
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

95
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:37.733
<v Speaker 2>So he was one.</v>

96
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.470
<v Speaker 2>He was one of the first experiment centers with hallucinogens fundamentally.</v>

97
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.080
<v Speaker 2>And he wrote hippie poetry on nitric oxide,</v>

98
00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.600
<v Speaker 2>noting what was likely something like the stripping away of latent inhibition as</v>

99
00:03:51.601 --> 00:03:52.434
<v Speaker 2>a consequence of,</v>

100
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.880
<v Speaker 2>of hallucinogenic use.</v>

101
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.330
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

102
00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.640
<v Speaker 2>and we're all the eldest Huxley of course,</v>

103
00:03:57.641 --> 00:04:02.641
<v Speaker 2>to believe that hallucinogens in particular clean the doors of perception using</v>

104
00:04:02.731 --> 00:04:06.330
<v Speaker 2>William Blake's terminology so that it was possible to see everything as if you</v>

105
00:04:06.331 --> 00:04:07.950
<v Speaker 2>were seeing it for the first time.</v>

106
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.310
<v Speaker 2>There's some forms of brain damage that can produce that too.</v>

107
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.690
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

108
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.940
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

109
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:13.211
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

110
00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:14.170
<v Speaker 2>So we tested it.</v>

111
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.881
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

112
00:04:14.881 --> 00:04:18.060
<v Speaker 2>it turned out that latent inhibition does look like low latent inhibition.</v>

113
00:04:18.061 --> 00:04:21.900
<v Speaker 2>It looks like it's a importantly related to creativity and to trade openness.</v>

114
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.030
<v Speaker 1>Abraham Maslow,</v>

115
00:04:24.031 --> 00:04:27.390
<v Speaker 1>he talked about newness of appreciation as one of the main characteristics of</v>

116
00:04:27.391 --> 00:04:30.200
<v Speaker 1>self actualizing people and I think that that can be linked to latent</v>

117
00:04:30.201 --> 00:04:30.620
<v Speaker 1>inhibition.</v>

118
00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:31.590
<v Speaker 1>I am sure you would agree.</v>

119
00:04:31.591 --> 00:04:32.760
<v Speaker 1>I bless you just described,</v>

120
00:04:32.761 --> 00:04:33.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

121
00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.090
<v Speaker 1>kind of everything is you kind of wander to the world.</v>

122
00:04:36.091 --> 00:04:38.190
<v Speaker 1>There's a wonder everything is kind of fresh again.</v>

123
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.561
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

124
00:04:38.561 --> 00:04:39.910
<v Speaker 2>The cost is likely.</v>

125
00:04:39.911 --> 00:04:41.660
<v Speaker 2>Something like cognitive overload.</v>

126
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.150
<v Speaker 2>One of the things does,</v>

127
00:04:43.151 --> 00:04:44.530
<v Speaker 2>Shelly Carson and I,</v>

128
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.540
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to investigate when we studied the hi openness people at Harvard to</v>

129
00:04:49.541 --> 00:04:50.500
<v Speaker 2>high openness students,</v>

130
00:04:50.501 --> 00:04:51.880
<v Speaker 2>which was very good place to study.</v>

131
00:04:51.881 --> 00:04:52.714
<v Speaker 2>That was that.</v>

132
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.750
<v Speaker 2>It looks like in order to handle the excess sensory input of low latent</v>

133
00:04:58.161 --> 00:04:58.641
<v Speaker 2>inhibition,</v>

134
00:04:58.641 --> 00:05:01.010
<v Speaker 2>it's really useful to have very high,</v>

135
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.210
<v Speaker 2>well probably high Iq,</v>

136
00:05:02.211 --> 00:05:04.010
<v Speaker 2>but an high working memory.</v>

137
00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.200
<v Speaker 2>Those two concepts are quite overlapping,</v>

138
00:05:06.201 --> 00:05:08.140
<v Speaker 2>so it's difficult to distinguish between them,</v>

139
00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:12.530
<v Speaker 2>but it seems probable that if you're prone to be overwhelmed by sensory</v>

140
00:05:12.531 --> 00:05:17.310
<v Speaker 2>information that you need the cognitive capacity to handle that and also perhaps</v>

141
00:05:17.311 --> 00:05:18.050
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

142
00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.430
<v Speaker 2>and we don't know about this yet,</v>

143
00:05:19.431 --> 00:05:24.100
<v Speaker 2>but the personality ability to sort through that critically so you don't end up</v>

144
00:05:24.101 --> 00:05:24.934
<v Speaker 2>overwhelmed.</v>

145
00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.110
<v Speaker 1>So the shared vulnerability model of your student,</v>

146
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.170
<v Speaker 1>Shelly Carson is very relevant here,</v>

147
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.083
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

148
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

149
00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:32.900
<v Speaker 2>Do you know about.</v>

150
00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.920
<v Speaker 2>I haven't kept up so well in the last couple of years with the recent work</v>

151
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.160
<v Speaker 2>detailing out the shared vulnerability models.</v>

152
00:05:39.161 --> 00:05:43.600
<v Speaker 2>Shelly and I wrote a joint series of articles for the Canadian Journal of</v>

153
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.140
<v Speaker 2>Psychiatry on shared vulnerability between a openness and predisposition to</v>

154
00:05:48.141 --> 00:05:48.974
<v Speaker 2>schizophrenia.</v>

155
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's always lurking in the background when you talk about creativity,</v>

156
00:05:52.741 --> 00:05:52.981
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

157
00:05:52.981 --> 00:05:56.480
<v Speaker 2>The share the overlap with manic depressive disorder and potentially with</v>

158
00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:57.323
<v Speaker 2>schizophrenia.</v>

159
00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's ever been sorted out properly.</v>

160
00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.450
<v Speaker 1>I've written a couple of papers in the past five years on the genetics of</v>

161
00:06:03.451 --> 00:06:05.960
<v Speaker 1>psychosis and it's overlapped with creativity,</v>

162
00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:07.660
<v Speaker 1>which is a fascinating,</v>

163
00:06:07.661 --> 00:06:07.811
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

164
00:06:07.811 --> 00:06:08.011
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

165
00:06:08.011 --> 00:06:11.790
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of recent research on the genetics of this stuff and showing this</v>

166
00:06:11.791 --> 00:06:16.220
<v Speaker 1>overlap and it seems to be particularly associate with this openness that things</v>

167
00:06:16.221 --> 00:06:18.300
<v Speaker 1>really opens and things related to the default network.</v>

168
00:06:18.301 --> 00:06:21.300
<v Speaker 1>So I think the discovery of the default mode network in recent years has really</v>

169
00:06:21.301 --> 00:06:22.470
<v Speaker 1>allowed us to understand this.</v>

170
00:06:22.471 --> 00:06:26.420
<v Speaker 1>So my colleagues and I published a paper recently showing a direct link between</v>

171
00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.660
<v Speaker 1>the efficiency of the default mode network and the personality trait.</v>

172
00:06:29.661 --> 00:06:30.770
<v Speaker 1>Openness to experience.</v>

173
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

174
00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:33.080
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

175
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.913
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

176
00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.390
<v Speaker 1>So we can now link,</v>

177
00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:36.220
<v Speaker 1>we can link,</v>

178
00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:36.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

179
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.650
<v Speaker 1>the brain structure and network dynamics.</v>

180
00:06:38.651 --> 00:06:38.891
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

181
00:06:38.891 --> 00:06:43.420
<v Speaker 1>So we used a network approach to look at the connectivity of the default network</v>

182
00:06:43.421 --> 00:06:47.500
<v Speaker 1>and actually analyze individual differences in the connectivity between people</v>

183
00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:48.700
<v Speaker 1>within the default network.</v>

184
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.680
<v Speaker 1>So as a measure of your efficiency within that particular brain network as a</v>

185
00:06:52.681 --> 00:06:53.480
<v Speaker 1>start.</v>

186
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.450
<v Speaker 1>And that was correlated with the openness to experience domain.</v>

187
00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:01.260
<v Speaker 2>So what does that mean in increased connectivity within the default network?</v>

188
00:07:01.261 --> 00:07:02.130
<v Speaker 2>Was associated with.</v>

189
00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:02.701
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

190
00:07:02.701 --> 00:07:06.080
<v Speaker 2>and what did the increased conductivity signify?</v>

191
00:07:06.081 --> 00:07:08.210
<v Speaker 2>What do you think the functional significance of that is?</v>

192
00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:13.470
<v Speaker 1>I think efficiency in the sense of quicker information flow between the three</v>

193
00:07:13.471 --> 00:07:17.940
<v Speaker 1>major sub hubs of the default mode network is the three sub networks that</v>

194
00:07:17.941 --> 00:07:19.390
<v Speaker 1>default mode network involved,</v>

195
00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:23.500
<v Speaker 1>the meaning making meaning making seems to be a huge part of this network.</v>

196
00:07:23.501 --> 00:07:23.950
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

197
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:25.180
<v Speaker 1>the construction of self.</v>

198
00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:27.500
<v Speaker 1>People who get kind of this network knocked out,</v>

199
00:07:27.501 --> 00:07:30.530
<v Speaker 1>they don't even know who they are anymore and I find that fascinating.</v>

200
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.690
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the mental simulation part,</v>

201
00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:34.250
<v Speaker 1>being able to imagine the future.</v>

202
00:07:34.251 --> 00:07:35.180
<v Speaker 1>That's why I've called this network,</v>

203
00:07:35.181 --> 00:07:39.380
<v Speaker 1>like the imagination network to be sexier about it because I think default mode</v>

204
00:07:39.381 --> 00:07:39.960
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

205
00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.110
<v Speaker 1>It connotes that it's kind of a passive network when it's actually a really</v>

206
00:07:43.111 --> 00:07:44.130
<v Speaker 1>active network.</v>

207
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:44.701
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I mean?</v>

208
00:07:44.701 --> 00:07:45.460
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not like A.</v>

209
00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:45.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

210
00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:46.403
<v Speaker 1>it does sound like it.</v>

211
00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:48.770
<v Speaker 2>It does make it sound like it's passive.</v>

212
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:49.191
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

213
00:07:49.191 --> 00:07:51.420
<v Speaker 2>did you see the work done with suicide?</v>

214
00:07:51.421 --> 00:07:55.940
<v Speaker 2>Been showing radical increase in brain connectivity under the influence of</v>

215
00:07:55.941 --> 00:07:56.450
<v Speaker 2>suicide?</v>

216
00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:57.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

217
00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:57.321
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

218
00:07:57.321 --> 00:08:01.610
<v Speaker 1>I love that and I think we're on the verge of something really integrated.</v>

219
00:08:01.611 --> 00:08:02.220
<v Speaker 1>Jordan [inaudible],</v>

220
00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:06.200
<v Speaker 1>like you wrote that paper with Rachel Aggretsuko Plant and Collin,</v>

221
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.030
<v Speaker 1>you mapped out the whole terrain.</v>

222
00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:10.370
<v Speaker 1>I love that because we've been building off that.</v>

223
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.760
<v Speaker 1>You could send you a paper where we had a synthesis of the whole literature.</v>

224
00:08:13.761 --> 00:08:17.500
<v Speaker 1>We have this hierarchical model of the cognitive exploration domain where you</v>

225
00:08:17.501 --> 00:08:21.460
<v Speaker 1>have like cognitive exploration at the top and then you have openness and an</v>

226
00:08:21.461 --> 00:08:22.061
<v Speaker 1>intellect,</v>

227
00:08:22.061 --> 00:08:24.970
<v Speaker 1>which is the paper where we showed openness until like differentially predict</v>

228
00:08:24.971 --> 00:08:25.720
<v Speaker 1>creative achievement,</v>

229
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:29.400
<v Speaker 1>but then under that you find all sorts of fastest which contradict which are</v>

230
00:08:29.401 --> 00:08:30.660
<v Speaker 1>negatively correlated with each other.</v>

231
00:08:30.661 --> 00:08:33.000
<v Speaker 1>Even though one step higher in the hierarchy,</v>

232
00:08:33.001 --> 00:08:34.230
<v Speaker 1>they're positively correlated.</v>

233
00:08:34.231 --> 00:08:34.870
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

234
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:35.830
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be going on there,</v>

235
00:08:35.831 --> 00:08:36.071
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

236
00:08:36.071 --> 00:08:39.880
<v Speaker 1>Is that there are these breed of humans that can take these contradictory modes</v>

237
00:08:39.881 --> 00:08:41.090
<v Speaker 1>of thought within themselves.</v>

238
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:41.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

239
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:41.801
<v Speaker 1>most people,</v>

240
00:08:41.801 --> 00:08:44.780
<v Speaker 1>the general population of all these sorts of the economy is you're either</v>

241
00:08:44.781 --> 00:08:45.920
<v Speaker 1>selfish or you're not selfish.</v>

242
00:08:45.921 --> 00:08:47.300
<v Speaker 1>You're either compassionate or you're not.</v>

243
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:47.960
<v Speaker 1>You're either,</v>

244
00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.360
<v Speaker 1>but it seems like credit people are amazing at able to like harness these</v>

245
00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:54.200
<v Speaker 1>seemingly contradictory modes of being and well,</v>

246
00:08:54.201 --> 00:08:54.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

247
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:55.460
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

248
00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:58.390
<v Speaker 2>it's probably a neat process of neoteny,</v>

249
00:08:59.040 --> 00:08:59.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

250
00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:02.620
<v Speaker 2>I think that the creative people stay immature.</v>

251
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:03.460
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>

252
00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:03.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

253
00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:04.150
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

254
00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:04.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

255
00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:04.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

256
00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:09.340
<v Speaker 2>there's a proclivity in evolution for creatures to evolve towards there</v>

257
00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:10.700
<v Speaker 2>neotenous forum.</v>

258
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:11.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

259
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:11.840
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

260
00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:12.291
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

261
00:09:12.291 --> 00:09:15.260
<v Speaker 2>and it looks to me like the creative types are,</v>

262
00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:19.070
<v Speaker 2>they're sustaining that plasticity they have is really early children.</v>

263
00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:23.840
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they are permanently law to some degree into that pretend play mode.</v>

264
00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:24.200
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

265
00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.380
<v Speaker 2>That's so characteristic of children between the age of four and say,</v>

266
00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:28.520
<v Speaker 2>well maybe 11,</v>

267
00:09:28.521 --> 00:09:29.360
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

268
00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:29.831
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

269
00:09:29.831 --> 00:09:31.690
<v Speaker 2>it's good to have both those things operating,</v>

270
00:09:31.691 --> 00:09:31.901
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

271
00:09:31.901 --> 00:09:33.220
<v Speaker 2>because often you talk to people.</v>

272
00:09:33.221 --> 00:09:36.910
<v Speaker 2>This is really characteristic of people who are sort of on the new age end of</v>

273
00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:37.300
<v Speaker 2>the spectrum.</v>

274
00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:40.390
<v Speaker 2>Carl Jung said something interesting once about how people think.</v>

275
00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:45.310
<v Speaker 2>He said for most people a thought appears in their mind and they just accepted</v>

276
00:09:45.311 --> 00:09:46.144
<v Speaker 2>uncritically.</v>

277
00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:46.810
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

278
00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:48.070
<v Speaker 2>So that's the thinking and.</v>

279
00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:51.560
<v Speaker 2>But that's not really thinking that would be more associated perhaps with what</v>

280
00:09:51.561 --> 00:09:54.440
<v Speaker 2>you described as activation of this imagination network,</v>

281
00:09:54.441 --> 00:09:58.830
<v Speaker 2>but it's a lot more difficult to have the thoughts appear and then to take them</v>

282
00:09:58.831 --> 00:10:03.390
<v Speaker 2>apart and I think it would be really worthwhile to analyze the role of,</v>

283
00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:07.870
<v Speaker 2>well we know Iq is important in that obviously because Iq just enables you to</v>

284
00:10:07.871 --> 00:10:09.310
<v Speaker 2>handle a large number of variables.</v>

285
00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:09.671
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

286
00:10:09.671 --> 00:10:13.690
<v Speaker 2>did you find out if that increased activity that you were describing was</v>

287
00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:15.460
<v Speaker 2>positively associated with Iq?</v>

288
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:16.140
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

289
00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:18.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm so glad you asked that because I was going to tell you about the follow up</v>

290
00:10:18.541 --> 00:10:19.390
<v Speaker 1>paper and by the way,</v>

291
00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:21.940
<v Speaker 1>I want to be totally fair to my collaborators.</v>

292
00:10:21.941 --> 00:10:23.380
<v Speaker 1>This was led by Roger bed.</v>

293
00:10:23.381 --> 00:10:26.290
<v Speaker 1>I ran something with Martin Seligman the last four years at Penn called the</v>

294
00:10:26.291 --> 00:10:29.320
<v Speaker 1>imagination institute and as part of that we put out a,</v>

295
00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.290
<v Speaker 1>a huge grant for people to do research.</v>

296
00:10:32.291 --> 00:10:34.630
<v Speaker 1>So we funded some of this research and I was a coauthor and some of these</v>

297
00:10:34.631 --> 00:10:35.330
<v Speaker 1>papers,</v>

298
00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:36.920
<v Speaker 1>but Roger bd did a lot of this work.</v>

299
00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.080
<v Speaker 1>Now with that out of the way,</v>

300
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:42.120
<v Speaker 1>the follow up paper showed that increased connectivity between the executive</v>

301
00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:46.200
<v Speaker 1>network and the default mode network was essential for creative thinking,</v>

302
00:10:46.201 --> 00:10:48.630
<v Speaker 1>so openness to experience is not equivalent to creative thinking.</v>

303
00:10:48.631 --> 00:10:48.841
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

304
00:10:48.841 --> 00:10:51.900
<v Speaker 1>so that's the kind of one step is to show there's a link between the imagination</v>

305
00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:52.111
<v Speaker 1>network,</v>

306
00:10:52.111 --> 00:10:52.920
<v Speaker 1>an openness,</v>

307
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:57.920
<v Speaker 1>but really real novel and meaningful creative cognition seem to require that</v>

308
00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:02.400
<v Speaker 1>both the default mode network and executive network executive tension and the</v>

309
00:11:02.401 --> 00:11:03.270
<v Speaker 1>salients network.</v>

310
00:11:03.271 --> 00:11:05.190
<v Speaker 1>Actually the salience network is an interesting network.</v>

311
00:11:05.191 --> 00:11:08.620
<v Speaker 1>We could talk about the interaction between those two networks were essential</v>

312
00:11:08.621 --> 00:11:10.870
<v Speaker 1>for the cognition to be novel and meaningful.</v>

313
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:14.630
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating because most people in the general population that santee</v>

314
00:11:14.631 --> 00:11:15.230
<v Speaker 1>correlated,</v>

315
00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:18.030
<v Speaker 1>some of these networks are anti-correlated like most people.</v>

316
00:11:18.031 --> 00:11:21.280
<v Speaker 1>For most people it's like as soon as you focus on the outside world,</v>

317
00:11:21.281 --> 00:11:23.740
<v Speaker 1>you shut up your imagination or when you go home,</v>

318
00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:24.161
<v Speaker 1>imagine.</v>

319
00:11:24.161 --> 00:11:24.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

320
00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.170
<v Speaker 1>but creative people who are really creative,</v>

321
00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.090
<v Speaker 1>they're like a good at keeping on call.</v>

322
00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:32.640
<v Speaker 2>That really is interesting because shelly and I,</v>

323
00:11:32.641 --> 00:11:35.460
<v Speaker 2>back when we were doing the creative achievement questionnaire research,</v>

324
00:11:35.461 --> 00:11:38.100
<v Speaker 2>we kind of thought that one of the things that might characterize creative</v>

325
00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:43.090
<v Speaker 2>people is that ability to switch back and forth between openness and critical</v>

326
00:11:43.091 --> 00:11:44.980
<v Speaker 2>thinking was under voluntary control</v>

327
00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:46.120
<v Speaker 1>suggested.</v>

328
00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.640
<v Speaker 1>I think to the extent to which it's under voluntary control.</v>

329
00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:50.240
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how I could study that.</v>

330
00:11:50.241 --> 00:11:52.730
<v Speaker 1>Like we just know that this is what the brain networks are doing.</v>

331
00:11:52.731 --> 00:11:54.040
<v Speaker 1>They're toggling back and forth,</v>

332
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:54.851
<v Speaker 2>but could we ask,</v>

333
00:11:54.851 --> 00:11:55.780
<v Speaker 2>could we do a report?</v>

334
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.430
<v Speaker 2>It's almost with a sense that like creative people,</v>

335
00:11:57.431 --> 00:11:58.960
<v Speaker 2>as soon as you ask them to think about it,</v>

336
00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:00.160
<v Speaker 2>if they're in the flow state,</v>

337
00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:01.950
<v Speaker 2>then suddenly evaporates.</v>

338
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:02.320
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

339
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:02.790
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

340
00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:03.001
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

341
00:12:03.001 --> 00:12:03.640
<v Speaker 2>we'll need to.</v>

342
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:04.690
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to tell how much.</v>

343
00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:04.991
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

344
00:12:04.991 --> 00:12:05.201
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

345
00:12:05.201 --> 00:12:05.441
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

346
00:12:05.441 --> 00:12:09.220
<v Speaker 2>and of course defining voluntary scientifically is not a straightforward thing,</v>

347
00:12:09.221 --> 00:12:14.221
<v Speaker 2>but it'd be interesting to see if people do think about that is voluntary and if</v>

348
00:12:14.801 --> 00:12:16.090
<v Speaker 2>it's a skill as well.</v>

349
00:12:16.091 --> 00:12:19.420
<v Speaker 2>If it's something that people can learn to develop because you can to some</v>

350
00:12:19.421 --> 00:12:19.770
<v Speaker 2>degree,</v>

351
00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:23.560
<v Speaker 2>teach people critical thinking like you can teach them to look at an idea and</v>

352
00:12:23.561 --> 00:12:25.000
<v Speaker 2>break it apart and analyze it,</v>

353
00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:27.700
<v Speaker 2>so all that remains to be determined,</v>

354
00:12:27.701 --> 00:12:28.534
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

355
00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:30.003
<v Speaker 2>Hi everyone.</v>

356
00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.310
<v Speaker 2>I just wanted to take this moment to thank you for your support of this podcast</v>

357
00:12:33.311 --> 00:12:34.144
<v Speaker 2>over the years.</v>

358
00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:37.660
<v Speaker 2>It's been a lot of fun doing this podcast for over the past three years.</v>

359
00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:40.090
<v Speaker 2>If you'd like to further support the podcast,</v>

360
00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:42.910
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to let you know a few things you could do to make it a better</v>

361
00:12:42.911 --> 00:12:44.080
<v Speaker 2>experience for you all.</v>

362
00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:45.161
<v Speaker 2>First,</v>

363
00:12:45.161 --> 00:12:46.030
<v Speaker 2>I'd really appreciate it.</v>

364
00:12:46.031 --> 00:12:47.950
<v Speaker 2>If you could subscribe to the show in itunes.</v>

365
00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:51.010
<v Speaker 2>This will help make the show more prominent and itunes and increase our</v>

366
00:12:51.011 --> 00:12:51.844
<v Speaker 2>listenership.</v>

367
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:55.060
<v Speaker 2>I believe you can describe both on your phone and on your computer.</v>

368
00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:56.201
<v Speaker 2>Second,</v>

369
00:12:56.201 --> 00:12:58.960
<v Speaker 2>it'd be great if you could give the show a rating and review in itunes.</v>

370
00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:01.030
<v Speaker 2>I definitely read all the reviews.</v>

371
00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:04.030
<v Speaker 2>Another thing you can do is donate some money to the show,</v>

372
00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:07.840
<v Speaker 2>like under the psychology podcast.com and clicking on the link support the</v>

373
00:13:07.841 --> 00:13:09.610
<v Speaker 2>podcast at the bottom of the page.</v>

374
00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:12.100
<v Speaker 2>That's the psychology podcast.com.</v>

375
00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:16.960
<v Speaker 2>Some of you had been noting that the audio quality was less than optimal thanks</v>

376
00:13:16.961 --> 00:13:18.790
<v Speaker 2>to the donations that we've been receiving.</v>

377
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:22.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm really excited to announce that in the next couple of weeks we're gonna have</v>

378
00:13:22.991 --> 00:13:27.991
<v Speaker 2>a completely revamped audio structure to the show and you should notice a huge</v>

379
00:13:28.001 --> 00:13:29.440
<v Speaker 2>improvement in the audio quality.</v>

380
00:13:29.441 --> 00:13:30.610
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for your patience with that.</v>

381
00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:33.280
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for your support of the show over the years.</v>

382
00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:35.380
<v Speaker 2>It's been a real labor of love for me.</v>

383
00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:36.341
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

384
00:13:36.341 --> 00:13:37.174
<v Speaker 2>Back to the show.</v>

385
00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.390
<v Speaker 2>So let's move onto some other topics.</v>

386
00:13:40.391 --> 00:13:42.370
<v Speaker 2>You did this really interesting study that I read,</v>

387
00:13:42.371 --> 00:13:45.910
<v Speaker 2>you know I wrote about inside of America with Christine Brophy on the</v>

388
00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:49.210
<v Speaker 2>personality of credits we found we were logging well,</v>

389
00:13:49.211 --> 00:13:50.860
<v Speaker 2>two things we wanted to establish.</v>

390
00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:55.240
<v Speaker 2>The first is we wanted to establish if there was a coherent group of political</v>

391
00:13:55.241 --> 00:13:56.260
<v Speaker 2>beliefs and attitudes.</v>

392
00:13:56.261 --> 00:14:00.220
<v Speaker 2>Let's say that you could bring under the rubric of political correctness,</v>

393
00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:00.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

394
00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:04.330
<v Speaker 2>because of course you know that just because a concept pops up in the popular</v>

395
00:14:04.331 --> 00:14:04.841
<v Speaker 2>literature,</v>

396
00:14:04.841 --> 00:14:05.171
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

397
00:14:05.171 --> 00:14:07.240
<v Speaker 2>or often even in the psychological literature,</v>

398
00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:10.330
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't mean that the concept has any basis.</v>

399
00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:11.163
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

400
00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:15.340
<v Speaker 2>what we did was we did a standard psychometric investigation and so we</v>

401
00:14:15.341 --> 00:14:18.700
<v Speaker 2>oversampled the politically correct attitude domain.</v>

402
00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:23.020
<v Speaker 2>We had a bunch of people come up with questions that seemed to be indicative of</v>

403
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:26.560
<v Speaker 2>what people were describing when they discuss political correctness in the media</v>

404
00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:32.040
<v Speaker 2>and we put together I think 400 questions and had a very large number of people</v>

405
00:14:32.051 --> 00:14:34.570
<v Speaker 2>answer all of them and then subjected the question.</v>

406
00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:35.291
<v Speaker 2>The answer is two,</v>

407
00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:39.940
<v Speaker 2>a factor analysis and came up with a coherent two factor solution to political</v>

408
00:14:39.941 --> 00:14:40.750
<v Speaker 2>correctness.</v>

409
00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:44.110
<v Speaker 2>One that looked like it was associated with what you might describe as the</v>

410
00:14:44.111 --> 00:14:44.950
<v Speaker 2>radical left,</v>

411
00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:48.520
<v Speaker 2>the interventionist radical left and the other that was more associated with,</v>

412
00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:53.940
<v Speaker 2>I would say just left leaning and then looked at the personality predictors and</v>

413
00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.490
<v Speaker 2>personality and cognitive predictors of.</v>

414
00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:57.630
<v Speaker 2>Of both of those,</v>

415
00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:58.391
<v Speaker 2>they weren't.</v>

416
00:14:58.391 --> 00:14:59.500
<v Speaker 2>That highly correlated.</v>

417
00:14:59.501 --> 00:15:00.430
<v Speaker 2>Interestingly enough,</v>

418
00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:04.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was partly because we used to extraction technique that decreased</v>

419
00:15:04.891 --> 00:15:05.611
<v Speaker 2>the correlations,</v>

420
00:15:05.611 --> 00:15:06.330
<v Speaker 2>but you could,</v>

421
00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:10.940
<v Speaker 2>you could extract are two quite separate sets of political belief and yeah,</v>

422
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:11.331
<v Speaker 2>trait.</v>

423
00:15:11.331 --> 00:15:13.070
<v Speaker 2>Agreeableness was a good predictor,</v>

424
00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:16.440
<v Speaker 2>which was quite interesting because it hadn't showed up that power trait,</v>

425
00:15:16.441 --> 00:15:19.190
<v Speaker 2>agreeableness and being female as well,</v>

426
00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.990
<v Speaker 2>which was also quite interesting.</v>

427
00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:25.950
<v Speaker 2>We're in a situation now way where it isn't obvious how men and women are going</v>

428
00:15:25.951 --> 00:15:30.951
<v Speaker 2>to cooperate politically because it does look like our differences are intrinsic</v>

429
00:15:31.551 --> 00:15:35.180
<v Speaker 2>differences in personality and interest might divide us quite radically</v>

430
00:15:35.181 --> 00:15:38.820
<v Speaker 2>politically and so god only knows how that's gonna play out on the political</v>

431
00:15:38.821 --> 00:15:39.470
<v Speaker 2>realm.</v>

432
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.651
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

433
00:15:39.651 --> 00:15:40.980
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting to think about and I.</v>

434
00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:44.650
<v Speaker 1>I've been trying to wrap my head around the real practical implications when I</v>

435
00:15:44.651 --> 00:15:46.010
<v Speaker 1>look at the data and then try it.</v>

436
00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:49.300
<v Speaker 1>Like I'd like to hear your thoughts on what you think the percentage of this</v>

437
00:15:49.301 --> 00:15:50.410
<v Speaker 1>could really be impactful.</v>

438
00:15:50.411 --> 00:15:54.280
<v Speaker 1>So like I look at a figure the other day of the overlap of the distribution and</v>

439
00:15:54.281 --> 00:15:57.160
<v Speaker 1>compassion and there is in the general population,</v>

440
00:15:57.161 --> 00:15:59.410
<v Speaker 1>we're not talking about like it's a totally different plan,</v>

441
00:15:59.460 --> 00:15:59.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

442
00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:04.240
<v Speaker 1>70 percent overlap and the bfs that you cocreated with Colin,</v>

443
00:16:04.241 --> 00:16:04.371
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

444
00:16:04.371 --> 00:16:07.390
<v Speaker 1>and so in that paper recalling looked at the gender differences and the</v>

445
00:16:07.391 --> 00:16:10.750
<v Speaker 1>different big 10 compassion did have the largest gender difference.</v>

446
00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.730
<v Speaker 1>But if you look at the actual graph,</v>

447
00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:12.941
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

448
00:16:12.941 --> 00:16:16.210
<v Speaker 1>you see like 70 percent and of course it doesn't say anything about at the</v>

449
00:16:16.211 --> 00:16:17.044
<v Speaker 1>extremes.</v>

450
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:21.620
<v Speaker 2>This is something that people really don't understand.</v>

451
00:16:21.621 --> 00:16:23.660
<v Speaker 2>And social scientists don't understand that well either.</v>

452
00:16:23.661 --> 00:16:24.530
<v Speaker 2>Although we should.</v>

453
00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:28.710
<v Speaker 2>Like there's two things that were not trained well I think in social scientists.</v>

454
00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:33.160
<v Speaker 2>One is consideration of the tails because the tails have disproportionate impact</v>

455
00:16:33.161 --> 00:16:36.010
<v Speaker 2>on behavior and on political and economic outcomes.</v>

456
00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:40.370
<v Speaker 2>And then the other is the distribution problem because most of us are taught</v>

457
00:16:40.371 --> 00:16:43.910
<v Speaker 2>that almost everything is normally distributed and that actually turns out</v>

458
00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.680
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of important exceptions to that,</v>

459
00:16:45.681 --> 00:16:46.880
<v Speaker 2>including creative achievement.</v>

460
00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:48.950
<v Speaker 2>It's not normally distributed at all.</v>

461
00:16:48.951 --> 00:16:49.700
<v Speaker 2>It's just standard.</v>

462
00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:54.700
<v Speaker 2>Frito distributed probably be small differences at the average level and then</v>

463
00:16:54.911 --> 00:16:58.720
<v Speaker 2>walloping differences at the extreme and then it's the differences at the</v>

464
00:16:58.721 --> 00:17:00.010
<v Speaker 2>extreme that determined behavior.</v>

465
00:17:00.011 --> 00:17:00.850
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

466
00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:01.270
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

467
00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:04.950
<v Speaker 2>there's good evidence that the difference between men and women with regards to</v>

468
00:17:04.951 --> 00:17:08.370
<v Speaker 2>interest in people versus things is about one standard deviation,</v>

469
00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:12.330
<v Speaker 2>which is the largest psychometric difference between the genders.</v>

470
00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:14.170
<v Speaker 2>That's been reported as far as I know.</v>

471
00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:16.200
<v Speaker 2>And so then you think,</v>

472
00:17:16.201 --> 00:17:16.501
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

473
00:17:16.501 --> 00:17:17.010
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

474
00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:19.920
<v Speaker 2>it still means that men and women overlapped to a large degree.</v>

475
00:17:19.921 --> 00:17:23.340
<v Speaker 2>But if you look at what determined someone's decision,</v>

476
00:17:23.341 --> 00:17:23.971
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

477
00:17:23.971 --> 00:17:25.860
<v Speaker 2>to go into a field like engineering,</v>

478
00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:27.820
<v Speaker 2>you probably have to be.</v>

479
00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:32.380
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't think what percentage of the population are engineers.</v>

480
00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:34.090
<v Speaker 2>I bet it's no more than two percent.</v>

481
00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:36.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

482
00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:36.641
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

483
00:17:36.641 --> 00:17:36.911
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

484
00:17:36.911 --> 00:17:37.211
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

485
00:17:37.211 --> 00:17:37.481
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

486
00:17:37.481 --> 00:17:38.800
<v Speaker 2>so let's say one in 50,</v>

487
00:17:38.801 --> 00:17:40.000
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's one in 25,</v>

488
00:17:40.001 --> 00:17:40.511
<v Speaker 2>but whatever.</v>

489
00:17:40.511 --> 00:17:41.261
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>

490
00:17:41.261 --> 00:17:42.430
<v Speaker 2>Five percent of the population.</v>

491
00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.870
<v Speaker 2>So let's say to be an engineer,</v>

492
00:17:44.871 --> 00:17:48.240
<v Speaker 2>well you have to have a high Iq and you have to be conscientious,</v>

493
00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:50.650
<v Speaker 2>but then you have be interested in things,</v>

494
00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:53.440
<v Speaker 2>but you don't have to be just a little bit interested in things.</v>

495
00:17:53.441 --> 00:17:58.240
<v Speaker 2>You have to be really interested in things and even if the okay average</v>

496
00:17:58.241 --> 00:18:01.120
<v Speaker 2>difference between men and women is only one standard deviation,</v>

497
00:18:01.121 --> 00:18:02.530
<v Speaker 2>which is still a comparatively large,</v>

498
00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:06.910
<v Speaker 2>that could mean that virtually everybody who's really interested in things ends</v>

499
00:18:06.911 --> 00:18:09.450
<v Speaker 2>up being male and that's exactly what you see.</v>

500
00:18:09.451 --> 00:18:13.850
<v Speaker 2>You see about a 15 to one preponderance of male engineers versus female</v>

501
00:18:13.851 --> 00:18:15.450
<v Speaker 2>engineers and you know,</v>

502
00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:16.041
<v Speaker 2>you might say,</v>

503
00:18:16.041 --> 00:18:18.400
<v Speaker 2>well that's socio-cultural and can,</v>

504
00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:19.450
<v Speaker 2>can be ameliorated,</v>

505
00:18:19.451 --> 00:18:23.090
<v Speaker 2>but the evidence doesn't support down at all because those differences maximize</v>

506
00:18:23.091 --> 00:18:24.550
<v Speaker 2>in the Scandinavian countries.</v>

507
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:27.150
<v Speaker 1>You mind if I just think really interesting.</v>

508
00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:28.130
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

509
00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:28.611
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

510
00:18:28.611 --> 00:18:29.660
<v Speaker 1>I want to thank you for.</v>

511
00:18:29.661 --> 00:18:32.120
<v Speaker 1>I've lost like 100 of your videos to prepare for this interview.</v>

512
00:18:32.121 --> 00:18:33.930
<v Speaker 1>So like even if I don't always agree with you,</v>

513
00:18:33.931 --> 00:18:34.231
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

514
00:18:34.231 --> 00:18:36.690
<v Speaker 1>it helps clarify what in the hell I actually believe.</v>

515
00:18:36.691 --> 00:18:39.300
<v Speaker 1>So thank you for being so authentic and your opinions.</v>

516
00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:42.340
<v Speaker 1>I totally believe in quality of opportunity.</v>

517
00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:42.821
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

518
00:18:42.821 --> 00:18:46.810
<v Speaker 1>And it seems like what really irks you is when people call for equality of</v>

519
00:18:46.811 --> 00:18:47.340
<v Speaker 1>outcome,</v>

520
00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:49.000
<v Speaker 1>that that's really where you know when you're ready.</v>

521
00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:50.560
<v Speaker 2>Infuriate is a better way.</v>

522
00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:52.180
<v Speaker 2>I know how dangerous it is.</v>

523
00:18:52.181 --> 00:18:53.830
<v Speaker 2>It's unbelievably dangerous.</v>

524
00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:57.130
<v Speaker 2>People have no idea what to messing with when they mess with equality of</v>

525
00:18:57.131 --> 00:18:57.461
<v Speaker 2>outcome.</v>

526
00:18:57.461 --> 00:18:58.070
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

527
00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:00.490
<v Speaker 2>and then do you have a nuanced discussion about it,</v>

528
00:19:00.491 --> 00:19:00.851
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

529
00:19:00.851 --> 00:19:02.110
<v Speaker 2>because that's what we should do.</v>

530
00:19:02.111 --> 00:19:02.441
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

531
00:19:02.441 --> 00:19:03.040
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

532
00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:08.040
<v Speaker 2>the data indicate more and more strongly that there are significant differences</v>

533
00:19:08.341 --> 00:19:12.680
<v Speaker 2>between men and women in a variety of dimensions and more importantly that those</v>

534
00:19:12.681 --> 00:19:16.070
<v Speaker 2>differences expand as cultures become more egalitarian.</v>

535
00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:17.151
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

536
00:19:17.151 --> 00:19:19.880
<v Speaker 2>so then that opens up an avenue of political questions.</v>

537
00:19:19.881 --> 00:19:22.390
<v Speaker 2>It's like the first political question would be,</v>

538
00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:24.530
<v Speaker 2>the first observation should be,</v>

539
00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:29.970
<v Speaker 2>we better accept that as fact because it actually seems to be grounded in very</v>

540
00:19:29.971 --> 00:19:34.780
<v Speaker 2>serious science and the scientists who discovered this biased in the opposite</v>

541
00:19:34.781 --> 00:19:35.530
<v Speaker 2>direction,</v>

542
00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:37.480
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't what they were happy to find.</v>

543
00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:39.290
<v Speaker 2>No one expected it.</v>

544
00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:39.931
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

545
00:19:39.931 --> 00:19:41.310
<v Speaker 2>but let's take it at face value.</v>

546
00:19:41.311 --> 00:19:43.230
<v Speaker 2>Just for the sake of argument and say,</v>

547
00:19:43.231 --> 00:19:43.561
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

548
00:19:43.561 --> 00:19:46.500
<v Speaker 2>now this opens up a minefield of political questions.</v>

549
00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:48.043
<v Speaker 2>The first is,</v>

550
00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:49.240
<v Speaker 2>so for example,</v>

551
00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:52.910
<v Speaker 2>let me take a pro diversity stamps just for a minute,</v>

552
00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:55.480
<v Speaker 2>even though it hurts my heart to do so,</v>

553
00:19:56.170 --> 00:20:01.170
<v Speaker 2>so it looks like if we allowed naturalistic sorting to take place merely as a</v>

554
00:20:01.931 --> 00:20:03.970
<v Speaker 2>consequence of people's express choices,</v>

555
00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.460
<v Speaker 2>that all of the elementary school teachers would end up being women.</v>

556
00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:09.101
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

557
00:20:09.101 --> 00:20:09.631
<v Speaker 2>well it's so,</v>

558
00:20:09.631 --> 00:20:13.100
<v Speaker 2>so it's going to be there and it already is the vast majority of the budget.</v>

559
00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:15.390
<v Speaker 2>If the sorting continues unabated,</v>

560
00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:17.740
<v Speaker 2>that's likely to increase that.</v>

561
00:20:17.741 --> 00:20:19.180
<v Speaker 2>Increasingly it is what it is,</v>

562
00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:22.630
<v Speaker 2>but we don't know what to do about that from a sociopolitical perspective.</v>

563
00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:23.500
<v Speaker 2>Now you know,</v>

564
00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:26.740
<v Speaker 2>hypothetically we could enforce equity of outcome,</v>

565
00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:28.220
<v Speaker 2>equality of outcome,</v>

566
00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:30.800
<v Speaker 2>but it would be extremely costly.</v>

567
00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:35.810
<v Speaker 2>It would require a tyrannical effort on the part of the government and there</v>

568
00:20:35.811 --> 00:20:39.080
<v Speaker 2>would be all sorts of unintended negative consequences.</v>

569
00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:39.501
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

570
00:20:39.501 --> 00:20:42.170
<v Speaker 2>those might be consequences that we're willing to bear,</v>

571
00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:46.460
<v Speaker 2>but we don't want to move into this under the presupposition that the</v>

572
00:20:46.461 --> 00:20:47.200
<v Speaker 2>differences.</v>

573
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:50.890
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to eradicate our only socio-cultural in nature because clearly</v>

574
00:20:50.891 --> 00:20:54.500
<v Speaker 2>they're not and you'd hope that we would get to the point where we could</v>

575
00:20:54.501 --> 00:20:56.350
<v Speaker 2>actually have an intelligent discussion about it.</v>

576
00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:58.120
<v Speaker 2>We don't know what to do about this.</v>

577
00:20:58.470 --> 00:20:59.303
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing,</v>

578
00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:00.751
<v Speaker 1>the proposal,</v>

579
00:21:00.751 --> 00:21:02.880
<v Speaker 1>what to do about it in one of your videos,</v>

580
00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:06.450
<v Speaker 1>the one that I talked about because you actually made a concrete I and one of</v>

581
00:21:06.451 --> 00:21:09.260
<v Speaker 1>the videos I watched you made a very specific argument.</v>

582
00:21:09.261 --> 00:21:09.531
<v Speaker 1>You said,</v>

583
00:21:09.531 --> 00:21:11.390
<v Speaker 1>I think that we should eliminate poverty,</v>

584
00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:14.350
<v Speaker 1>that we should have eliminated unnecessary suffering,</v>

585
00:21:14.351 --> 00:21:14.531
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

586
00:21:14.531 --> 00:21:17.650
<v Speaker 1>give everyone a relative sort of baseline of income.</v>

587
00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:20.400
<v Speaker 1>But then after that is the next stage,</v>

588
00:21:20.401 --> 00:21:24.310
<v Speaker 1>we should sort of allow the free market to sort of like allow people to then</v>

589
00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:25.061
<v Speaker 1>express.</v>

590
00:21:25.061 --> 00:21:25.920
<v Speaker 1>So you still stand by that.</v>

591
00:21:25.921 --> 00:21:27.900
<v Speaker 1>Will you send that video about their function of the state?</v>

592
00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:28.720
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

593
00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.570
<v Speaker 2>I don't know because it's so complicated like I don't,</v>

594
00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:35.740
<v Speaker 2>I certainly don't think that we should rush headlong into the provision of a</v>

595
00:21:35.741 --> 00:21:39.930
<v Speaker 2>universal basic income because the probability that that will have radically</v>

596
00:21:39.931 --> 00:21:42.630
<v Speaker 2>unintended consequences is unbelievably high.</v>

597
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:45.380
<v Speaker 2>So I think one of the things that would probably do,</v>

598
00:21:45.381 --> 00:21:47.450
<v Speaker 2>especially among unemployed,</v>

599
00:21:47.451 --> 00:21:48.500
<v Speaker 2>hopeless people,</v>

600
00:21:48.501 --> 00:21:53.150
<v Speaker 2>is increase their access to drugs like oxycontin and opiates.</v>

601
00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:58.670
<v Speaker 2>See the problem with the left wing view of improving economic equality is the</v>

602
00:21:58.841 --> 00:22:02.770
<v Speaker 2>left wingers are so obsessed with the economic side of inequality that they</v>

603
00:22:02.771 --> 00:22:05.560
<v Speaker 2>don't pay enough attention to the cultural side of inequality.</v>

604
00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:09.540
<v Speaker 2>So if you're down at the bottom of the economic pyramid,</v>

605
00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:12.440
<v Speaker 2>the fact that you don't have enough money is a big problem,</v>

606
00:22:12.441 --> 00:22:15.230
<v Speaker 2>but it's only one of many serious problems you have.</v>

607
00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:19.370
<v Speaker 2>And I would say an equally serious problem is that you don't have anything</v>

608
00:22:19.371 --> 00:22:20.061
<v Speaker 2>productive,</v>

609
00:22:20.061 --> 00:22:22.730
<v Speaker 2>engaging and meaningful to do with your time.</v>

610
00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:24.700
<v Speaker 2>And the problem with that is that,</v>

611
00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:25.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

612
00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:26.570
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you know this or not,</v>

613
00:22:26.571 --> 00:22:31.150
<v Speaker 2>but it's pretty easy to get rats that are isolated in a cage singly to be</v>

614
00:22:31.151 --> 00:22:32.170
<v Speaker 2>addicted to cocaine.</v>

615
00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:34.370
<v Speaker 2>You can do it very rapidly,</v>

616
00:22:34.371 --> 00:22:38.060
<v Speaker 2>but it's almost impossible to get routes in the naturalistic environment</v>

617
00:22:38.061 --> 00:22:39.020
<v Speaker 2>addicted to cocaine.</v>

618
00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:40.920
<v Speaker 1>That's really interesting.</v>

619
00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:41.760
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

620
00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:42.031
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

621
00:22:42.031 --> 00:22:42.181
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

622
00:22:42.181 --> 00:22:43.014
<v Speaker 2>there was there.</v>

623
00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:47.240
<v Speaker 2>He followed just slouched behaviorist that studied routes in their natural</v>

624
00:22:47.241 --> 00:22:50.690
<v Speaker 2>environment and they're quite a bit different than the genetically modified</v>

625
00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:55.810
<v Speaker 2>three quarter bodyweight starved single lab rat existing alone in the cage.</v>

626
00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:57.650
<v Speaker 2>Rats are social creatures,</v>

627
00:22:57.651 --> 00:22:58.484
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

628
00:22:59.630 --> 00:22:59.841
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

629
00:22:59.841 --> 00:23:02.270
<v Speaker 2>Well if you were sitting alone in prison,</v>

630
00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:03.070
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

631
00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:06.690
<v Speaker 2>and somebody and offered you an endless access to cocaine,</v>

632
00:23:06.691 --> 00:23:09.730
<v Speaker 2>it's like the probability that you take it is extremely high,</v>

633
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.310
<v Speaker 2>but if you have something better to do then it's low.</v>

634
00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:15.860
<v Speaker 2>The problem we're going to have to deal with is more like provision of</v>

635
00:23:15.861 --> 00:23:20.420
<v Speaker 2>meaningful activity to people who are being displaced by large scale</v>

636
00:23:20.421 --> 00:23:22.080
<v Speaker 2>socioeconomic transformation.</v>

637
00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:25.240
<v Speaker 2>That's not a matter of merely redistributing income.</v>

638
00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:27.830
<v Speaker 1>Do you know the video I'm talking about when you talk about the function of the</v>

639
00:23:27.831 --> 00:23:28.664
<v Speaker 1>state?</v>

640
00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:28.941
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

641
00:23:28.941 --> 00:23:29.271
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

642
00:23:29.271 --> 00:23:32.900
<v Speaker 2>I think I would send a political convention in Canada about five years ago.</v>

643
00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.120
<v Speaker 1>I've done work on what are called like.</v>

644
00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:36.240
<v Speaker 1>I've done work on giftedness.</v>

645
00:23:36.241 --> 00:23:38.040
<v Speaker 1>I've been working on kids with learning disabilities.</v>

646
00:23:38.041 --> 00:23:38.400
<v Speaker 1>Trying to.</v>

647
00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.610
<v Speaker 1>The equality of opportunity is what I'm playing for.</v>

648
00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:41.330
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm.</v>

649
00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:43.620
<v Speaker 1>And in terms of aligning it with the science as well,</v>

650
00:23:43.621 --> 00:23:44.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

651
00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:46.860
<v Speaker 1>it's a beautiful thing me when they are not a post,</v>

652
00:23:46.861 --> 00:23:50.120
<v Speaker 1>when there's the truth and the helping someone or you know,</v>

653
00:23:50.121 --> 00:23:50.720
<v Speaker 1>the same thing,</v>

654
00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:50.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

655
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:51.621
<v Speaker 1>that's a beautiful thing,</v>

656
00:23:51.621 --> 00:23:52.280
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

657
00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:52.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

658
00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:53.403
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

659
00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:54.950
<v Speaker 1>this is an interesting question,</v>

660
00:23:54.951 --> 00:23:58.620
<v Speaker 1>is like what could the function of the state opportunity b too helped her make</v>

661
00:23:58.621 --> 00:24:01.260
<v Speaker 1>sure that there's a quality of individual expression?</v>

662
00:24:01.261 --> 00:24:02.520
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's what we're talking about here.</v>

663
00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:03.503
<v Speaker 2>Well that's written.</v>

664
00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:05.850
<v Speaker 2>That is a fundamental question.</v>

665
00:24:05.851 --> 00:24:07.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean million dollar question.</v>

666
00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:07.901
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

667
00:24:07.901 --> 00:24:11.080
<v Speaker 2>Well one of the things the state does quite effectively is invest in universally</v>

668
00:24:11.081 --> 00:24:12.340
<v Speaker 2>accessible infrastructure.</v>

669
00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:15.150
<v Speaker 2>So everybody benefits from safe,</v>

670
00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:16.410
<v Speaker 2>clean streets,</v>

671
00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:17.140
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

672
00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:20.880
<v Speaker 2>And everybody benefits from it on active cultural meal.</v>

673
00:24:20.881 --> 00:24:25.110
<v Speaker 2>You like a city like Montreal is a really good example that is extraordinarily</v>

674
00:24:25.111 --> 00:24:25.950
<v Speaker 2>culturally active.</v>

675
00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:28.950
<v Speaker 2>There's festivals going on there all the time and a lot of them are outside.</v>

676
00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:30.270
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them are free.</v>

677
00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:31.800
<v Speaker 2>Everyone benefits from that.</v>

678
00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:34.480
<v Speaker 2>Education is a good hypothetically,</v>

679
00:24:34.481 --> 00:24:38.050
<v Speaker 2>a good place for the state to invest with regards to equality of opportunity.</v>

680
00:24:38.051 --> 00:24:41.680
<v Speaker 2>Although it disproportionately benefits people who are on the upper end of the</v>

681
00:24:41.681 --> 00:24:42.850
<v Speaker 2>cognitive distribution,</v>

682
00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:44.930
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to escape from that a.</v>

683
00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.440
<v Speaker 2>So that's for sure.</v>

684
00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:52.520
<v Speaker 2>Back to the back to the intrinsic difference issue is like we don't really know</v>

685
00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:57.800
<v Speaker 2>what the political impact is of the fact that men and women seem highly likely</v>

686
00:24:59.501 --> 00:25:04.501
<v Speaker 2>to sort themselves out into different occupations if we just allow them free</v>

687
00:25:04.681 --> 00:25:08.600
<v Speaker 2>choice cause no one has thought that no one thought that was what was going to</v>

688
00:25:08.601 --> 00:25:09.240
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

689
00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.510
<v Speaker 2>You know when the bloody okay,</v>

690
00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:14.140
<v Speaker 2>radical leftists are fighting this like mad because they insist that all these</v>

691
00:25:14.141 --> 00:25:15.730
<v Speaker 2>differences are associate cultural,</v>

692
00:25:15.731 --> 00:25:18.100
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is it doesn't look like they are</v>

693
00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:20.740
<v Speaker 1>all of these politics and fractions,</v>

694
00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:21.500
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

695
00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:22.390
<v Speaker 1>Individual differences.</v>

696
00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.740
<v Speaker 1>What is fits fascinates me.</v>

697
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.580
<v Speaker 1>People are complex systems.</v>

698
00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:29.340
<v Speaker 1>Every one of us is a complex system of lots of personality traits,</v>

699
00:25:29.341 --> 00:25:29.941
<v Speaker 1>motivations,</v>

700
00:25:29.941 --> 00:25:31.540
<v Speaker 1>etc. And you know,</v>

701
00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:34.350
<v Speaker 1>there are people who score high on compassion regardless of whether you're a</v>

702
00:25:34.351 --> 00:25:34.981
<v Speaker 1>male or female.</v>

703
00:25:34.981 --> 00:25:35.820
<v Speaker 1>A lot of ice score.</v>

704
00:25:35.821 --> 00:25:39.000
<v Speaker 1>High question I heard you say you score high on capacity in one of your videos.</v>

705
00:25:39.001 --> 00:25:39.210
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

706
00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:40.290
<v Speaker 1>when you went through the bfs,</v>

707
00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:41.850
<v Speaker 1>so it's not like we're saying like,</v>

708
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:42.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

709
00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:43.680
<v Speaker 1>you have to be female to be competitive,</v>

710
00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:44.521
<v Speaker 2>which is funny.</v>

711
00:25:44.521 --> 00:25:46.350
<v Speaker 2>With the politically correct research we did,</v>

712
00:25:46.351 --> 00:25:48.990
<v Speaker 2>we did find that a lot of the predictive power,</v>

713
00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:54.230
<v Speaker 2>a lot of what was predicting affiliation with politically correct standpoint was</v>

714
00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:55.640
<v Speaker 2>trait agreeableness,</v>

715
00:25:55.880 --> 00:26:00.280
<v Speaker 2>but being female was an additional predictor and that was really strange because</v>

716
00:26:00.281 --> 00:26:01.150
<v Speaker 2>most of the time,</v>

717
00:26:01.151 --> 00:26:04.840
<v Speaker 2>and I'm sure this is the case with literature that you've investigated as well.</v>

718
00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:09.050
<v Speaker 2>Most of the time if you look at sex differences in a particular outcome,</v>

719
00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:11.810
<v Speaker 2>you can get rid of them by controlling for temperament,</v>

720
00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:15.150
<v Speaker 2>but you could most of them look like we didn't know there was an additional</v>

721
00:26:15.151 --> 00:26:17.100
<v Speaker 2>effect of there was an additional effect.</v>

722
00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:17.830
<v Speaker 2>Sex.</v>

723
00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:18.663
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

724
00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:20.340
<v Speaker 1>Did you look at politeness versus</v>

725
00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:21.513
<v Speaker 2>passion?</v>

726
00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:22.061
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

727
00:26:22.061 --> 00:26:22.421
<v Speaker 2>we did,</v>

728
00:26:22.421 --> 00:26:23.254
<v Speaker 2>but I can't.</v>

729
00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:26.580
<v Speaker 2>It's been a while since I reviewed the paper and I can't bring it to mind.</v>

730
00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:27.161
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

731
00:26:27.161 --> 00:26:27.340
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

732
00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:29.500
<v Speaker 2>I think it was driven mostly by compassion,</v>

733
00:26:29.501 --> 00:26:30.640
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly.</v>

734
00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:31.470
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

735
00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:32.360
<v Speaker 2>And it makes sense,</v>

736
00:26:32.361 --> 00:26:32.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

737
00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:36.040
<v Speaker 2>because I think that what's happening on the end of the spectrum,</v>

738
00:26:36.041 --> 00:26:38.380
<v Speaker 2>let's say political views are driven by compassion,</v>

739
00:26:38.381 --> 00:26:43.381
<v Speaker 2>is compassion is primarily a dimension that's there to facilitate intense</v>

740
00:26:43.611 --> 00:26:47.560
<v Speaker 2>relationships between individuals and their dependents.</v>

741
00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:50.710
<v Speaker 2>Which kind of looks to me like what compassion does is that,</v>

742
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:51.401
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

743
00:26:51.401 --> 00:26:54.420
<v Speaker 2>you have compassion for an infant or you have compassion for someone who's</v>

744
00:26:54.421 --> 00:26:55.500
<v Speaker 2>elderly and unwell.</v>

745
00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:57.300
<v Speaker 2>If you're a very compassionate person,</v>

746
00:26:57.301 --> 00:27:02.301
<v Speaker 2>it's very easy to take the side of the downtrodden and to look for a perpetrator</v>

747
00:27:03.521 --> 00:27:05.410
<v Speaker 2>or cars and lots of time.</v>

748
00:27:05.411 --> 00:27:06.550
<v Speaker 2>That's extremely useful,</v>

749
00:27:06.551 --> 00:27:06.761
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

750
00:27:06.761 --> 00:27:09.610
<v Speaker 2>If you're taking care of an infant and the infant is in distress,</v>

751
00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:13.320
<v Speaker 2>the first thing you should be doing is scanning the environment for the cause</v>

752
00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:14.700
<v Speaker 2>and eliminating it.</v>

753
00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:17.390
<v Speaker 2>One Answered question is,</v>

754
00:27:17.391 --> 00:27:17.541
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

755
00:27:17.541 --> 00:27:22.040
<v Speaker 2>what happens when you scale up that personality attribute and it starts to</v>

756
00:27:22.041 --> 00:27:23.000
<v Speaker 2>operate politically?</v>

757
00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:24.830
<v Speaker 2>Here's some.</v>

758
00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:25.770
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thought for you.</v>

759
00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:27.010
<v Speaker 2>Tell me what you think about this.</v>

760
00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:32.750
<v Speaker 2>I think that we have to traits that orient us in the social world.</v>

761
00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:38.210
<v Speaker 2>I think agreeable disorients us in small groups and conscientiousness orients us</v>

762
00:27:38.821 --> 00:27:39.541
<v Speaker 2>in large,</v>

763
00:27:39.541 --> 00:27:42.590
<v Speaker 2>impersonal groups and that the switch point,</v>

764
00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:47.700
<v Speaker 2>the point where you transitioned from an agreeable viewpoint to a conscientious</v>

765
00:27:47.701 --> 00:27:48.534
<v Speaker 2>viewpoint is,</v>

766
00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:49.980
<v Speaker 2>is indeterminate.</v>

767
00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:53.230
<v Speaker 1>Is tHere a sex difference on the conscientiousness are males tire?</v>

768
00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:54.810
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

769
00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:56.090
<v Speaker 2>you're a little more orderly.</v>

770
00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:56.720
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

771
00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:58.260
<v Speaker 2>And men are a little more into distress.</v>

772
00:27:58.400 --> 00:27:59.040
<v Speaker 1>It does,</v>

773
00:27:59.040 --> 00:27:59.231
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

774
00:27:59.231 --> 00:28:02.600
<v Speaker 1>I was going to ask industrious in particular because roy baumeister made a</v>

775
00:28:02.601 --> 00:28:02.990
<v Speaker 1>similar.</v>

776
00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:05.950
<v Speaker 1>You could link that to roy baumeister's argument and what are men good for?</v>

777
00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:06.920
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the title of the book.</v>

778
00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:09.180
<v Speaker 1>He argues that that's the major sex difference,</v>

779
00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:12.250
<v Speaker 1>that it's not like men or women are better than each other.</v>

780
00:28:12.251 --> 00:28:15.670
<v Speaker 1>It's that like there have been different motivations in terms of how we want to</v>

781
00:28:15.671 --> 00:28:19.170
<v Speaker 1>help people and a lot of men have tended throughout the course of history to</v>

782
00:28:19.171 --> 00:28:19.710
<v Speaker 1>wanting to help,</v>

783
00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:20.011
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

784
00:28:20.011 --> 00:28:23.820
<v Speaker 1>like a huge social networks have huge social networks and I wonder if that's a</v>

785
00:28:23.821 --> 00:28:25.080
<v Speaker 1>difference in exactly what you're saying.</v>

786
00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:25.621
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

787
00:28:25.621 --> 00:28:26.580
<v Speaker 2>I think it might be.</v>

788
00:28:26.581 --> 00:28:27.480
<v Speaker 2>I think it might.</v>

789
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:29.063
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

790
00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:30.340
<v Speaker 2>human beings are strange.</v>

791
00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:30.940
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

792
00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:32.950
<v Speaker 2>there's no animal warden for conscientiousness.</v>

793
00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:33.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

794
00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:33.921
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

795
00:28:33.921 --> 00:28:34.754
<v Speaker 2>is that right?</v>

796
00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:35.170
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

797
00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:36.080
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen one.</v>

798
00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:36.631
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

799
00:28:36.631 --> 00:28:37.610
<v Speaker 2>that's so interesting.</v>

800
00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:38.151
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

801
00:28:38.151 --> 00:28:38.491
<v Speaker 1>it's funny,</v>

802
00:28:38.491 --> 00:28:39.750
<v Speaker 1>I was chatting with column the other day.</v>

803
00:28:39.751 --> 00:28:40.261
<v Speaker 1>He said that,</v>

804
00:28:40.261 --> 00:28:40.441
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

805
00:28:40.441 --> 00:28:44.190
<v Speaker 1>they just found a correlation between the salients network and conscientiousness</v>

806
00:28:44.191 --> 00:28:45.990
<v Speaker 1>and that's not really well evolved</v>

807
00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:47.500
<v Speaker 2>in other animals.</v>

808
00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:48.580
<v Speaker 2>That's just interesting.</v>

809
00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:50.080
<v Speaker 2>So look,</v>

810
00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:51.220
<v Speaker 2>if you think about it this way,</v>

811
00:28:51.221 --> 00:28:55.990
<v Speaker 2>if you think that imagine that there's a human niche niche distinguishes us from</v>

812
00:28:55.991 --> 00:28:58.010
<v Speaker 2>animals and I mean obviously there is,</v>

813
00:28:58.011 --> 00:29:03.011
<v Speaker 2>but one of the distinguishing elements is that we can produce groups whose size</v>

814
00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:08.220
<v Speaker 2>exceeds that of our primate cognitive capacity.</v>

815
00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:09.101
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

816
00:29:09.101 --> 00:29:09.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

817
00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:13.060
<v Speaker 2>I think it's dunbar's work indicates that with human beings,</v>

818
00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:18.150
<v Speaker 2>our tribes tend to fractionate when they exceed about a group of about 200,</v>

819
00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:21.130
<v Speaker 2>but obviously we can produce groups that are much,</v>

820
00:29:21.131 --> 00:29:23.080
<v Speaker 2>much larger than that that are functional.</v>

821
00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:26.510
<v Speaker 2>But what that means is that those groups have to operate on principles that are</v>

822
00:29:26.511 --> 00:29:30.200
<v Speaker 2>outside of the networks that other primates would use to organize themselves</v>

823
00:29:30.201 --> 00:29:30.890
<v Speaker 2>socially.</v>

824
00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:33.320
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's where conscientiousness kicks in.</v>

825
00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:34.061
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

826
00:29:34.061 --> 00:29:38.030
<v Speaker 2>and if you look at what predicts performance in bureaucracies,</v>

827
00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:39.840
<v Speaker 2>it's conscientiousness,</v>

828
00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:41.560
<v Speaker 2>snot agreeableness.</v>

829
00:29:41.561 --> 00:29:41.951
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

830
00:29:41.951 --> 00:29:46.020
<v Speaker 2>agreeableness is slightly correlated negatively with managerial performance and</v>

831
00:29:46.021 --> 00:29:46.580
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

832
00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:46.810
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

833
00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:50.200
<v Speaker 2>I think once a group exceeds the size where it's familiar,</v>

834
00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:54.560
<v Speaker 2>then you have to use a different ethical system to cope with it and that's</v>

835
00:29:54.561 --> 00:29:57.800
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness and I think one of the problems with what's happening to us</v>

836
00:29:57.801 --> 00:29:59.990
<v Speaker 2>politically right now is that we're trying to implement.</v>

837
00:29:59.991 --> 00:30:04.310
<v Speaker 2>Agreeableness has a political trait and I don't think it functions well in large</v>

838
00:30:04.311 --> 00:30:05.144
<v Speaker 2>groups.</v>

839
00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:06.360
<v Speaker 1>I hear that argument.</v>

840
00:30:06.361 --> 00:30:11.361
<v Speaker 1>I think sometimes some of the things that you are perceiving as relevant to the</v>

841
00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:12.200
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness,</v>

842
00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:15.140
<v Speaker 1>to me it might be actually something different and let me elaborate what I mean.</v>

843
00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:16.640
<v Speaker 1>So I've done some research lately.</v>

844
00:30:16.641 --> 00:30:20.120
<v Speaker 1>I realized that there's no scale of pathological altruism.</v>

845
00:30:20.121 --> 00:30:23.210
<v Speaker 1>It's a construct that barbara oakley has written about,</v>

846
00:30:23.211 --> 00:30:25.340
<v Speaker 1>but I want to do systematic research on this.</v>

847
00:30:25.341 --> 00:30:27.080
<v Speaker 1>I think this is relevant to this conversation,</v>

848
00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:32.570
<v Speaker 1>so I constructed a reliable and valid scale of pathological altruism and it is</v>

849
00:30:32.571 --> 00:30:34.820
<v Speaker 1>negatively correlated with agreeableness and compassion.</v>

850
00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:37.190
<v Speaker 1>We're not talking about it's in that domain.</v>

851
00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:41.540
<v Speaker 2>What did you find were the defining characteristics of pathological altruism?</v>

852
00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:42.421
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

853
00:30:42.421 --> 00:30:46.110
<v Speaker 1>so we looked at grandiose narcissism versus vulnerable narcissism.</v>

854
00:30:46.111 --> 00:30:47.790
<v Speaker 1>I am so fascinated with that distinction.</v>

855
00:30:47.791 --> 00:30:51.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't think vulnerable narcissism has got as much attention in the literature.</v>

856
00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:53.260
<v Speaker 1>We found about point six,</v>

857
00:30:53.261 --> 00:30:53.831
<v Speaker 1>point seven,</v>

858
00:30:53.831 --> 00:30:57.040
<v Speaker 1>correlation between pathological altruism and vulnerable narcissism.</v>

859
00:30:58.720 --> 00:30:59.250
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

860
00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Vulnerable narcissism is this,</v>

861
00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:02.320
<v Speaker 1>they called it a psychoanalyst,</v>

862
00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:06.560
<v Speaker 1>got a closet narcism where it's like you have these grandiose fantasies inside</v>

863
00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:07.520
<v Speaker 1>and you have entitlement,</v>

864
00:31:07.521 --> 00:31:10.040
<v Speaker 1>so you score score skyhigh on entitlement.</v>

865
00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:13.310
<v Speaker 1>However you don't present yourself that way.</v>

866
00:31:13.311 --> 00:31:16.130
<v Speaker 1>You present yourself as really vulnerable.</v>

867
00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:18.580
<v Speaker 1>We find that the grandiose narcissism vulnerable,</v>

868
00:31:18.581 --> 00:31:22.540
<v Speaker 1>so they score high on the grandiose fantasies questionnaIre and entitlement</v>

869
00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:24.820
<v Speaker 1>subscale differentiates them,</v>

870
00:31:24.821 --> 00:31:26.050
<v Speaker 1>is trait neuroticism.</v>

871
00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:27.580
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing that differentiates them,</v>

872
00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:30.890
<v Speaker 1>so whereas grandiose narcissism is with much lower in neuroticism,</v>

873
00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:34.140
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable narcissism almost perfectly correlated with high neuroticism,</v>

874
00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:36.160
<v Speaker 2>almost perfectly correlated,</v>

875
00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:37.733
<v Speaker 2>correlated</v>

876
00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:41.540
<v Speaker 1>one of my collaborators who on that paper he wrote another paper with a title.</v>

877
00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:44.330
<v Speaker 1>Vulnerable narcissism is mostly just neuroticism.</v>

878
00:31:44.331 --> 00:31:46.100
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about if you do a structural model,</v>

879
00:31:46.101 --> 00:31:48.050
<v Speaker 1>we're talking literally almost perfectly correlated.</v>

880
00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:51.740
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that additional variants that's explained as some antagonism,</v>

881
00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:52.281
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

882
00:31:52.281 --> 00:31:53.510
<v Speaker 1>entitlement for instance,</v>

883
00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:57.690
<v Speaker 2>it's a subset of highly neurotic people who also have developed a sense of</v>

884
00:31:57.780 --> 00:31:58.410
<v Speaker 2>entitlement,</v>

885
00:31:58.410 --> 00:31:59.243
<v Speaker 1>entitlement,</v>

886
00:31:59.250 --> 00:31:59.820
<v Speaker 1>and assertive,</v>

887
00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:01.620
<v Speaker 1>interpersonal antagonism towards others.</v>

888
00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:02.670
<v Speaker 1>So we're not talking about</v>

889
00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:05.600
<v Speaker 2>you guys are really onto something there.</v>

890
00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:06.261
<v Speaker 2>Great,</v>

891
00:32:06.261 --> 00:32:06.600
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

892
00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:06.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

893
00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:07.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

894
00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:07.880
<v Speaker 2>I really think so.</v>

895
00:32:07.881 --> 00:32:12.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean the question is whether or not you're just fleshing out neuroticism with</v>

896
00:32:12.461 --> 00:32:15.780
<v Speaker 2>those sorts of correlations or whether you've got a subset of people in there</v>

897
00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:18.310
<v Speaker 2>who have taken neuroticism to the next step.</v>

898
00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:22.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's synonymous with eroticism because most people who present</v>

899
00:32:22.021 --> 00:32:24.750
<v Speaker 1>themselves with high neuroticism to the therapist as you know,</v>

900
00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:25.830
<v Speaker 1>if they are depressed,</v>

901
00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:28.920
<v Speaker 1>not like they have this grandiose fantasy is an entitlement.</v>

902
00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:32.310
<v Speaker 1>Early developmental experiences seems to be a really interesting moderator.</v>

903
00:32:32.311 --> 00:32:32.940
<v Speaker 1>We found.</v>

904
00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:36.610
<v Speaker 1>We found that those who were told that they're worthless and childhood or that</v>

905
00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:40.920
<v Speaker 1>were actually in some sense did experience sort of trauma in their childhood.</v>

906
00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:43.860
<v Speaker 1>That seems to actually correlate with later on.</v>

907
00:32:43.861 --> 00:32:46.310
<v Speaker 1>And I think that from a clinician perspective,</v>

908
00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:46.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

909
00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:50.050
<v Speaker 1>we want to help these individuals integrate health lena society and I think</v>

910
00:32:50.051 --> 00:32:52.360
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's where your responsibility argument comes into play.</v>

911
00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:54.860
<v Speaker 2>Well the union idea behind that was the,</v>

912
00:32:54.910 --> 00:32:57.410
<v Speaker 2>those grandiose fantasies were compensations,</v>

913
00:32:57.411 --> 00:32:57.681
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

914
00:32:57.681 --> 00:32:59.090
<v Speaker 2>And that within them,</v>

915
00:32:59.240 --> 00:32:59.460
<v Speaker 2>okaY,</v>

916
00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:02.490
<v Speaker 2>there was the seeds in some sense of the developmental pathway.</v>

917
00:33:02.491 --> 00:33:06.480
<v Speaker 2>So if someone is oppressed and put down continually and they develop competence,</v>

918
00:33:06.481 --> 00:33:07.530
<v Speaker 2>suntory fantasies,</v>

919
00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:11.320
<v Speaker 2>the fantasies are you can think about them as the manifestation of that</v>

920
00:33:11.321 --> 00:33:12.520
<v Speaker 2>imagination network,</v>

921
00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:15.420
<v Speaker 2>trying to lay out an alternative mode of being.</v>

922
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:19.650
<v Speaker 2>But then those fantasies have to be subject to critical analysis so they don't</v>

923
00:33:19.651 --> 00:33:24.390
<v Speaker 2>become dwelling places or reasons for bitterness in relationship to the world.</v>

924
00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:28.250
<v Speaker 1>We just came full circle in the sense that in a way that started this</v>

925
00:33:28.251 --> 00:33:28.761
<v Speaker 1>discussion,</v>

926
00:33:28.761 --> 00:33:28.971
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

927
00:33:28.971 --> 00:33:29.930
<v Speaker 1>like this interplay,</v>

928
00:33:29.931 --> 00:33:33.210
<v Speaker 1>but dynamic interplay between imagination and then rationality and this.</v>

929
00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:33.811
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

930
00:33:33.811 --> 00:33:35.250
<v Speaker 2>the problem with those fantasies,</v>

931
00:33:35.251 --> 00:33:38.340
<v Speaker 2>well the problem with those fantasies is that they're not decomposed.</v>

932
00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:38.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

933
00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:43.170
<v Speaker 2>So like if you're dealing with someone that's someone clinically and they have</v>

934
00:33:43.171 --> 00:33:44.040
<v Speaker 2>these fantasies,</v>

935
00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:48.250
<v Speaker 2>then you might think about them as a starting place for how they could more</v>

936
00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:49.570
<v Speaker 2>modified their life.</v>

937
00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:54.890
<v Speaker 2>so the fantasy is saying the fantasy is serving as a counterpart to the painful</v>

938
00:33:54.891 --> 00:33:55.724
<v Speaker 2>reality.</v>

939
00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:57.600
<v Speaker 2>The painful reality is downtrodden,</v>

940
00:33:57.601 --> 00:33:58.434
<v Speaker 2>neuroticism.</v>

941
00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:03.400
<v Speaker 2>The fantasy is as far on the other end of the scale as like it balances the</v>

942
00:34:03.401 --> 00:34:07.300
<v Speaker 2>pathology by putting something on the other end of the scale that's equally far</v>

943
00:34:07.301 --> 00:34:07.930
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>

944
00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:12.250
<v Speaker 2>Then you have to help the person take a critical look at the fantasy and start</v>

945
00:34:12.251 --> 00:34:16.790
<v Speaker 2>to make it a reality instead of just a fantasy and to lay out a strategic plan</v>

946
00:34:16.791 --> 00:34:17.624
<v Speaker 2>for doing that.</v>

947
00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:18.810
<v Speaker 1>Exactly,</v>

948
00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:19.540
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

949
00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:19.781
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

950
00:34:19.781 --> 00:34:20.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean look,</v>

951
00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:20.441
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

952
00:34:20.441 --> 00:34:21.061
<v Speaker 1>we're all human.</v>

953
00:34:21.061 --> 00:34:23.250
<v Speaker 1>Like I personally went through a stage.</v>

954
00:34:23.251 --> 00:34:24.660
<v Speaker 1>I think when I was in my early twenties,</v>

955
00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:26.130
<v Speaker 1>I was so insecure.</v>

956
00:34:26.131 --> 00:34:27.830
<v Speaker 1>Like I wanted it to be like academic.</v>

957
00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:28.720
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to like,</v>

958
00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:31.590
<v Speaker 1>that was my way of proving that I was smart and that wasn't healthy,</v>

959
00:34:31.591 --> 00:34:31.891
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

960
00:34:31.891 --> 00:34:32.850
<v Speaker 1>and like I get it.</v>

961
00:34:32.851 --> 00:34:33.840
<v Speaker 1>But I also get,</v>

962
00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:34.391
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

963
00:34:34.391 --> 00:34:39.100
<v Speaker 1>the value of when I really decided to take some of these grandiose fantasies I</v>

964
00:34:39.101 --> 00:34:40.660
<v Speaker 1>had of being an academic and I say,</v>

965
00:34:40.661 --> 00:34:40.991
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>

966
00:34:40.991 --> 00:34:41.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

967
00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:44.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to just take it out of my head and I'm going to like work really</v>

968
00:34:44.501 --> 00:34:45.131
<v Speaker 1>freaking hard.</v>

969
00:34:45.131 --> 00:34:45.281
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

970
00:34:45.281 --> 00:34:48.640
<v Speaker 1>I was in special education as a kid because I didn't auditory disability.</v>

971
00:34:48.890 --> 00:34:49.051
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

972
00:34:49.051 --> 00:34:50.620
<v Speaker 1>But I was really young at one point.</v>

973
00:34:50.621 --> 00:34:52.990
<v Speaker 1>I just took 100 percent responsibility for that situation.</v>

974
00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:53.531
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

975
00:34:53.531 --> 00:34:55.210
<v Speaker 2>So you took the right route out of that.</v>

976
00:34:55.211 --> 00:34:56.770
<v Speaker 2>They'd have those fantasies,</v>

977
00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:01.800
<v Speaker 2>like you can think of those fantasies as part of the attempt by the,</v>

978
00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:06.320
<v Speaker 2>the mechanism that generates creativity to lay out a pathway forward.</v>

979
00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:07.301
<v Speaker 2>The problem is,</v>

980
00:35:07.301 --> 00:35:08.800
<v Speaker 2>is when people dwell in,</v>

981
00:35:08.801 --> 00:35:13.410
<v Speaker 2>the founder sees and dwell on the fantasies instead of instead of breaking them</v>

982
00:35:13.411 --> 00:35:15.930
<v Speaker 2>down into a strategic plan and realizing them,</v>

983
00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:18.880
<v Speaker 2>which is what a good therapist should help someone with.</v>

984
00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:19.933
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

985
00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:21.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you've done that in your practice.</v>

986
00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:22.770
<v Speaker 1>You were in practice over 20 years,</v>

987
00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:23.320
<v Speaker 1>just.</v>

988
00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:23.680
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

989
00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:24.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

990
00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:24.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

991
00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:24.841
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

992
00:35:24.841 --> 00:35:25.040
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

993
00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:28.940
<v Speaker 2>it's also what happens with our future authoring program because what we really</v>

994
00:35:28.941 --> 00:35:32.690
<v Speaker 2>asked people to do in the future authoring program is to generate a competence</v>

995
00:35:32.691 --> 00:35:33.800
<v Speaker 2>satori fantasy.</v>

996
00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:34.901
<v Speaker 2>Right now we say,</v>

997
00:35:34.901 --> 00:35:35.081
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

998
00:35:35.081 --> 00:35:39.670
<v Speaker 2>he lay out how your life could improved then imagine what your life would be</v>

999
00:35:39.671 --> 00:35:41.620
<v Speaker 2>like if all those improvements took place,</v>

1000
00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:43.330
<v Speaker 2>but we don't stop with that.</v>

1001
00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:43.690
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1002
00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:44.201
<v Speaker 2>Then we say,</v>

1003
00:35:44.201 --> 00:35:44.501
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1004
00:35:44.501 --> 00:35:48.090
<v Speaker 2>now subject that to some critical analysis,</v>

1005
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:49.050
<v Speaker 2>decompose it,</v>

1006
00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:50.880
<v Speaker 2>make it into a strategic plan,</v>

1007
00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:54.850
<v Speaker 2>break it down into things you would do day by day and week by week so they can</v>

1008
00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:56.770
<v Speaker 2>become realizable in the world.</v>

1009
00:35:57.250 --> 00:35:57.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1010
00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:58.021
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1011
00:35:58.021 --> 00:35:58.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1012
00:35:58.140 --> 00:35:59.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's so sensible,</v>

1013
00:35:59.161 --> 00:35:59.391
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1014
00:35:59.391 --> 00:36:00.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like,</v>

1015
00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:00.391
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1016
00:36:00.391 --> 00:36:01.530
<v Speaker 1>this paper I can send to you,</v>

1017
00:36:01.531 --> 00:36:03.120
<v Speaker 1>it's actually under review right now.</v>

1018
00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:06.410
<v Speaker 1>We have a whole section on the clinical implications of these findings and</v>

1019
00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:08.610
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1020
00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:09.443
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to see it.</v>

1021
00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:11.550
<v Speaker 1>Roy baumeister a really interesting book on.</v>

1022
00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:15.400
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the best sort of real honest assessment of evil.</v>

1023
00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:17.710
<v Speaker 1>Have you read the evil inside human violence and cruelty?</v>

1024
00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:18.481
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1025
00:36:18.481 --> 00:36:19.350
<v Speaker 2>I haven't read it yet.</v>

1026
00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:19.780
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1027
00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:20.510
<v Speaker 1>NoW something.</v>

1028
00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:23.800
<v Speaker 1>He talks in there because he wants to get a full understanding of all the causal</v>

1029
00:36:23.801 --> 00:36:26.680
<v Speaker 1>forces of what we call evil and something in there he talks about is he makes it</v>

1030
00:36:26.681 --> 00:36:28.950
<v Speaker 1>so clear that responsibilities not the same as culpability,</v>

1031
00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:30.590
<v Speaker 1>like responsibility at the same thing as bleeding</v>

1032
00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:32.900
<v Speaker 2>the situation you just described,</v>

1033
00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:37.710
<v Speaker 2>like let's say that you are high in neuroticism and you were subject to bullying</v>

1034
00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:40.110
<v Speaker 2>of a real sort and trauma when you were a kid.</v>

1035
00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:40.561
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1036
00:36:40.561 --> 00:36:42.900
<v Speaker 2>it's not like you're culpable for that.</v>

1037
00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:44.130
<v Speaker 2>Correct?</v>

1038
00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:44.500
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

1039
00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:47.170
<v Speaker 2>You need to take responsibility for it because,</v>

1040
00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:47.621
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1041
00:36:47.621 --> 00:36:48.760
<v Speaker 2>who else is going to.</v>

1042
00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:49.680
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1043
00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:50.150
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1044
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:52.010
<v Speaker 1>as a scientist and we want to truly,</v>

1045
00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:53.600
<v Speaker 1>truly understand the phenomenon.</v>

1046
00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:57.560
<v Speaker 1>We need to understand all of the causal factors and we need to do that as</v>

1047
00:36:57.561 --> 00:36:58.820
<v Speaker 1>objectively as possible.</v>

1048
00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:01.580
<v Speaker 1>That's not saying that we're not allowed to have compassion.</v>

1049
00:37:01.581 --> 00:37:03.710
<v Speaker 1>Like I have immense compassion want to make the world a better place.</v>

1050
00:37:03.711 --> 00:37:05.300
<v Speaker 1>I know you want to make the world a better place as well,</v>

1051
00:37:05.301 --> 00:37:10.030
<v Speaker 1>but I think I can like kind of separate those things at different times and then</v>

1052
00:37:10.031 --> 00:37:12.240
<v Speaker 1>try to kind of thoughtfully think through how we can integrate this.</v>

1053
00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:13.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1054
00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:14.340
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to see the paper.</v>

1055
00:37:14.341 --> 00:37:15.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm very interested in what you're doing.</v>

1056
00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:16.890
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to see both of them.</v>

1057
00:37:16.891 --> 00:37:18.090
<v Speaker 2>The one on the default network.</v>

1058
00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:18.781
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1059
00:37:18.781 --> 00:37:21.090
<v Speaker 2>and also the one on on vulnerable narcissism.</v>

1060
00:37:21.350 --> 00:37:23.900
<v Speaker 2>I really do think that's associated with the sorts of things that I've been</v>

1061
00:37:23.901 --> 00:37:24.411
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>

1062
00:37:24.411 --> 00:37:26.510
<v Speaker 2>Relationship to the school shooters for example,</v>

1063
00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:28.730
<v Speaker 2>because they develop grandiose competence,</v>

1064
00:37:28.731 --> 00:37:29.690
<v Speaker 2>suntory fantasies,</v>

1065
00:37:29.691 --> 00:37:32.340
<v Speaker 2>and then act them out the most pathological way.</v>

1066
00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:33.413
<v Speaker 2>Solely relevant.</v>

1067
00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:34.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1068
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.020
<v Speaker 2>Good talking with you.</v>

1069
00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:35.710
<v Speaker 1>Good talking to you.</v>

1070
00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:36.311
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for your time.</v>

1071
00:37:36.311 --> 00:37:36.800
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

1072
00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:39.590
<v Speaker 2>And then let me know when this goes up and I'll tweet it and all of that.</v>

1073
00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:40.570
<v Speaker 2>Sounds good.</v>

1074
00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:41.040
<v Speaker 2>Have a good day.</v>

1075
00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:41.510
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1076
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:42.040
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1077
00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:42.640
<v Speaker 2>see ya.</v>

1078
00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:42.910
<v Speaker 2>Bye.</v>
