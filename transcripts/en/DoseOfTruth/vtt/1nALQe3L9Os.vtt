1
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.240
<v Speaker 1>After the big ideas thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a act came into my classes and tape maps</v>

2
00:00:14.311 --> 00:00:16.820
<v Speaker 1>of meaning and made 1330 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.770
<v Speaker 1>TV shows out of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was pretty interesting.</v>

4
00:00:19.771 --> 00:00:24.300
<v Speaker 1>And they were broadcast and kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>evanescent because at that point they</v>

5
00:00:24.301 --> 00:00:26.340
<v Speaker 1>weren't put on the web.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're broadcast,</v>

6
00:00:26.341 --> 00:00:27.740
<v Speaker 1>they pretty much disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

7
00:00:27.741 --> 00:00:30.930
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

8
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:31.920
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

9
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:32.880
<v Speaker 1>so fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

10
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.260
<v Speaker 1>and I got some degree of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you say I got?</v>

11
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.980
<v Speaker 1>I was exposed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my ideas were exposed to a large number</v>

12
00:00:40.981 --> 00:00:42.930
<v Speaker 1>of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tens of thousands of people as a</v>

13
00:00:42.931 --> 00:00:45.780
<v Speaker 1>consequence of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that seemed to go pretty well.</v>

14
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.660
<v Speaker 1>And so then youtube came along and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>

15
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.990
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what this is,</v>

16
00:00:51.991 --> 00:00:54.460
<v Speaker 1>this youtube thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.730
<v Speaker 1>the comments section makes you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you say wary about being</v>

18
00:00:59.731 --> 00:01:01.920
<v Speaker 1>human?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say generally speaking,</v>

19
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.110
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of,</v>

20
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.090
<v Speaker 1>well there were a lot of things that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be easy to be contemptuous of on</v>

21
00:01:09.091 --> 00:01:12.330
<v Speaker 1>Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the canonical cute cat videos.</v>

22
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.280
<v Speaker 1>But I'm actually not so contemptuous of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that or the interesting animal videos</v>

23
00:01:17.281 --> 00:01:21.090
<v Speaker 1>because I think they actually speak to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of people that's actually quite</v>

24
00:01:21.091 --> 00:01:22.440
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We like cats,</v>

25
00:01:22.441 --> 00:01:24.600
<v Speaker 1>we like dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think animals are kind of cool.</v>

26
00:01:24.601 --> 00:01:26.430
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we take a break and look at,</v>

27
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.240
<v Speaker 1>look at something that's pleasant and</v>
<v Speaker 1>cute and maybe that's not so bad.</v>

28
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.540
<v Speaker 1>It's not serious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's certainly not malevolent.</v>

29
00:01:33.541 --> 00:01:36.840
<v Speaker 1>And that's something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I thought,</v>

30
00:01:36.841 --> 00:01:39.780
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'll find these old videos I did</v>

31
00:01:39.781 --> 00:01:44.310
<v Speaker 1>for Tvo and I'll put them up on youtube</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe I'll just take my classes.</v>

32
00:01:44.311 --> 00:01:47.760
<v Speaker 1>And so I set up because I have this</v>
<v Speaker 1>theory that if it's worth doing,</v>

33
00:01:47.761 --> 00:01:50.340
<v Speaker 1>it's worth doing badly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which you know,</v>

34
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.010
<v Speaker 1>it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also true that if it's worth</v>

35
00:01:53.011 --> 00:01:54.210
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's worth doing well.</v>

36
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.330
<v Speaker 1>You just need to know when to apply</v>
<v Speaker 1>those two principles.</v>

37
00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.050
<v Speaker 1>And if you're loath to do something and</v>
<v Speaker 1>procrastinating,</v>

38
00:02:01.051 --> 00:02:02.910
<v Speaker 1>then sometimes it's better to do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>badly.</v>

39
00:02:02.911 --> 00:02:05.130
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I can't get a whole production</v>

40
00:02:05.131 --> 00:02:07.920
<v Speaker 1>studio up and running and cause I just</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have the time.</v>

41
00:02:07.921 --> 00:02:12.921
<v Speaker 1>I'll get an IPAD and learn to use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And get an level ear mic and just set</v>

42
00:02:13.681 --> 00:02:15.720
<v Speaker 1>the thing up or maybe have a student</v>
<v Speaker 1>film it.</v>

43
00:02:15.721 --> 00:02:20.721
<v Speaker 1>And so I did that for a couple of years</v>
<v Speaker 1>for my personality class in this maps of</v>

44
00:02:20.971 --> 00:02:23.240
<v Speaker 1>meaning class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the class where I outlined this</v>

45
00:02:23.241 --> 00:02:25.200
<v Speaker 1>sorts of ideas that I just described to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

46
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.880
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

47
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.880
<v Speaker 1>last April I noticed that I'd had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>million views and about 15,000</v>

48
00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:33.210
<v Speaker 1>subscribers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:02:33.211 --> 00:02:34.980
<v Speaker 1>and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh,</v>

50
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.570
<v Speaker 1>million views,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

51
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.780
<v Speaker 1>that's an actually a lot of views.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if I,</v>

52
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.020
<v Speaker 1>I've never write a scientific paper</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's been read a million times,</v>

53
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.360
<v Speaker 1>no one has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that just never happens.</v>

54
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.550
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's happened zero times.</v>

55
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.250
<v Speaker 1>If it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a paper that's cited,</v>

56
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone else refers to it and one of</v>

57
00:02:51.991 --> 00:02:54.450
<v Speaker 1>their scientific papers a hundred times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

58
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.720
<v Speaker 1>that's a home run and a thousand times</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a miracle.</v>

59
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then if you write a book,</v>

60
00:03:00.101 --> 00:03:00.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

61
00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:03.580
<v Speaker 1>I think 1.2 million books published last</v>
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>

62
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.090
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think 500 of them sold more than a</v>

63
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.820
<v Speaker 1>hundred thousand copies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a sea of books,</v>

64
00:03:09.821 --> 00:03:10.141
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

65
00:03:10.141 --> 00:03:14.580
<v Speaker 1>it's an ocean of books and all of them</v>
<v Speaker 1>fail really.</v>

66
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.240
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many of them fail that you might as</v>

67
00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:19.930
<v Speaker 1>well never write a book because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>probability that it will fail is like</v>

68
00:03:19.931 --> 00:03:24.190
<v Speaker 1>99.99%.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that would be very depressing if it</v>

69
00:03:24.191 --> 00:03:27.490
<v Speaker 1>wasn't the case that that's the case for</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything creative you ever do.</v>

70
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.700
<v Speaker 1>So it's just baseline probability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I thought,</v>

71
00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:32.380
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I wrote a book and it sold a million</v>

72
00:03:32.381 --> 00:03:33.071
<v Speaker 1>copies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

73
00:03:33.071 --> 00:03:34.600
<v Speaker 1>I'd be out dancing in the street.</v>

74
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.100
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably not.</v>

75
00:03:36.101 --> 00:03:38.080
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get the idea.</v>

76
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.230
<v Speaker 1>So what does it mean to have a million</v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube views?</v>

77
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:42.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the hell knows?</v>

78
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:44.163
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

79
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.060
<v Speaker 1>we don't have metrics for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what sort of influence</v>

80
00:03:47.061 --> 00:03:49.180
<v Speaker 1>that's having.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know anything about that.</v>

81
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.220
<v Speaker 1>We don't know whether we should take it</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously or,</v>

82
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.220
<v Speaker 1>or if it's or who you're talking to or</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

83
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.540
<v Speaker 1>But I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

84
00:03:55.541 --> 00:03:58.930
<v Speaker 1>still it's a million then that's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

85
00:03:58.931 --> 00:03:59.860
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe this is,</v>

86
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.150
<v Speaker 1>this is more serious thing than I</v>
<v Speaker 1>initially envisioned.</v>

87
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.380
<v Speaker 1>And then I really thought about it and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>

88
00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.890
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

89
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.090
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

90
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.670
<v Speaker 1>Here's a hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

91
00:04:12.671 --> 00:04:16.870
<v Speaker 1>back in the medieval times and before if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wanted to book someone had to copy</v>

92
00:04:16.871 --> 00:04:20.110
<v Speaker 1>it by hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there weren't any books and they</v>

93
00:04:20.111 --> 00:04:21.700
<v Speaker 1>were very expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

94
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.630
<v Speaker 1>and then Gutenberg came along and</v>
<v Speaker 1>invented the movable type press and it</v>

95
00:04:25.631 --> 00:04:28.960
<v Speaker 1>was like poof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Books were inexpensive and everybody</v>

96
00:04:28.961 --> 00:04:31.450
<v Speaker 1>could have them and not like was that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a major revolution,</v>

97
00:04:31.451 --> 00:04:33.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It within 400 years,</v>

98
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.730
<v Speaker 1>almost everyone in the western world and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then very rapidly,</v>

99
00:04:36.731 --> 00:04:39.400
<v Speaker 1>almost everyone in the entire world was</v>
<v Speaker 1>literate.</v>

100
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.300
<v Speaker 1>He could read silently even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was something that before that was</v>

101
00:04:43.301 --> 00:04:46.660
<v Speaker 1>reserved for a very small number of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people because most people read out loud</v>

102
00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:50.110
<v Speaker 1>when they read it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was a massive revolution.</v>

103
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.960
<v Speaker 1>And then I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

104
00:04:52.961 --> 00:04:57.961
<v Speaker 1>maybe youtube is a Gutenberg revolution</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it allows the spoken word to</v>

105
00:04:59.051 --> 00:05:03.220
<v Speaker 1>have the same reach and longevity as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>book</v>

106
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.570
<v Speaker 1>for the first time in human history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spontaneous speeches can reach an</v>

107
00:05:10.331 --> 00:05:15.331
<v Speaker 1>infinite audience for eye for an</v>
<v Speaker 1>unspecified duration of time.</v>

108
00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a whole new thing.</v>

109
00:05:17.111 --> 00:05:19.120
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an entirely new thing.</v>

110
00:05:19.121 --> 00:05:23.440
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it's easier for people to</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen than it is for them to read.</v>

111
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:24.371
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

112
00:05:24.371 --> 00:05:27.490
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather read than listen cause I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>read way faster than I can listen.</v>

113
00:05:27.491 --> 00:05:31.320
<v Speaker 1>But people will listen to a youtube</v>
<v Speaker 1>video at twice the normal speed,</v>

114
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.790
<v Speaker 1>sometimes more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can circumvent that.</v>

115
00:05:33.791 --> 00:05:38.791
<v Speaker 1>And then also with a youtube video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you convert it into a podcast,</v>

116
00:05:38.861 --> 00:05:40.540
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'll get to to a moment,</v>

117
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.310
<v Speaker 1>you all of a sudden have way more time</v>
<v Speaker 1>than you used to have because you can</v>

118
00:05:45.311 --> 00:05:48.340
<v Speaker 1>listen to a podcast while you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>other things.</v>

119
00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.190
<v Speaker 1>So you can do mundane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mundane things that you have to do</v>

120
00:05:51.191 --> 00:05:53.500
<v Speaker 1>from day to day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like commute and so on.</v>

121
00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.070
<v Speaker 1>But you can listen to a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've found that my,</v>

122
00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.330
<v Speaker 1>my young students are now listening to</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcasts instead of music.</v>

123
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.430
<v Speaker 1>And that's really something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

124
00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:07.370
<v Speaker 1>because music of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been an unbelievably dynamic</v>

125
00:06:07.371 --> 00:06:12.371
<v Speaker 1>cultural force for maybe the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the primary artistic cultural force for</v>

126
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.360
<v Speaker 1>what maybe maybe since the 1950s</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>

127
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.900
<v Speaker 1>And that's being supplanted to some</v>
<v Speaker 1>degree by podcasts.</v>

128
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.600
<v Speaker 1>And that's really something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it also turns out that people</v>

129
00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:28.601
<v Speaker 1>have an appetite for long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>detailed podcasts that are deep and</v>

130
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.560
<v Speaker 1>informative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

131
00:06:30.561 --> 00:06:32.810
<v Speaker 1>who the hell would've guessed that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like no one.</v>

132
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.660
<v Speaker 1>It's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just sorta came out of nowhere.</v>

133
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.131
<v Speaker 1>And so I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

134
00:06:37.131 --> 00:06:39.110
<v Speaker 1>maybe this is worth taking seriously.</v>
