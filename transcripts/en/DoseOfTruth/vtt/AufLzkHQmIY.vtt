00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.290
<v Speaker 1>When I was looking at the difference between the Communist system and the</v>

2
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:11.610
<v Speaker 1>western capitalist system,</v>

3
00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:15.300
<v Speaker 1>I started to get underneath the belief systems to find out what was there at</v>

4
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:16.560
<v Speaker 1>yoga was extremely,</v>

5
00:00:16.561 --> 00:00:18.780
<v Speaker 1>how helpful and other thinkers that,</v>

6
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you've heard me mentioned,</v>

7
00:00:20.101 --> 00:00:21.390
<v Speaker 1>if you've listened to my lectures,</v>

8
00:00:21.391 --> 00:00:25.590
<v Speaker 1>Nietzschean and Dostoevsky and social knits and seem to be the people who had</v>

9
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.740
<v Speaker 1>dug deepest down into those subterranean levels.</v>

10
00:00:28.741 --> 00:00:29.910
<v Speaker 1>And what I found,</v>

11
00:00:29.911 --> 00:00:32.690
<v Speaker 1>I think was that the communist system was very,</v>

12
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.141
<v Speaker 1>very shallow.</v>

13
00:00:34.141 --> 00:00:38.070
<v Speaker 1>It was predicated on a set of rational assumptions that were generated by a</v>

14
00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:42.300
<v Speaker 1>handful of people with no real biological here or historical rooting.</v>

15
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:43.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

16
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.560
<v Speaker 1>and I think that the fact that that was the case was part of the reason why when</v>

17
00:00:48.841 --> 00:00:51.240
<v Speaker 1>those ideas unfolded in real time,</v>

18
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.680
<v Speaker 1>they were so murderous.</v>

19
00:00:52.681 --> 00:00:54.750
<v Speaker 1>They just weren't imagine that,</v>

20
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.090
<v Speaker 1>Karl Marx was thinking,</v>

22
00:00:57.091 --> 00:00:57.211
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

23
00:00:57.211 --> 00:00:58.680
<v Speaker 1>here's the game that we're playing in.</v>

24
00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.610
<v Speaker 1>Here are the rules.</v>

25
00:00:59.611 --> 00:01:04.200
<v Speaker 1>And so that he laid out the rules explicitly and then people made societies that</v>

26
00:01:04.201 --> 00:01:07.740
<v Speaker 1>follow those rules and it turned out that that game didn't work at all.</v>

27
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.180
<v Speaker 1>He just got it wrong.</v>

28
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.560
<v Speaker 1>And like seriously Ra.</v>

29
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.130
<v Speaker 1>Whereas in the west the ideas emerged from a,</v>

30
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.330
<v Speaker 1>an unbroken historical process that stretches back probably to the beginning of</v>

31
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:20.563
<v Speaker 1>civilization,</v>

32
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:21.510
<v Speaker 1>say maybe,</v>

33
00:01:21.511 --> 00:01:23.750
<v Speaker 1>maybe all the way back to Africa who knows how,</v>

34
00:01:23.751 --> 00:01:24.210
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

35
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.680
<v Speaker 1>how ancient these ideas are.</v>

36
00:01:25.681 --> 00:01:26.190
<v Speaker 1>And there's,</v>

37
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.080
<v Speaker 1>there's an unbroken con continuity of ideas that emerged up and that,</v>

38
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.950
<v Speaker 1>and they're expressed in symbolic form and it's on that symbolic platform which</v>

39
00:01:34.951 --> 00:01:39.510
<v Speaker 1>actually matches our biology and our behavior that are more articulated ideas</v>

40
00:01:39.511 --> 00:01:40.344
<v Speaker 1>rest upon.</v>

41
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.000
<v Speaker 1>And so I found that extremely useful and surprising.</v>

42
00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:47.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean it wasn't what I expected.</v>

43
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.440
<v Speaker 1>And at the same time I was,</v>

44
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.423
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

45
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.391
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>

46
00:01:54.391 --> 00:01:58.080
<v Speaker 1>another problem that emerged while I was dealing with this and one was that I</v>

47
00:01:58.081 --> 00:02:01.380
<v Speaker 1>come to understand what group identity meant to people.</v>

48
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.640
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to have a group identity because you live with other people and</v>

49
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.570
<v Speaker 1>unless you have a shared identity,</v>

50
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.250
<v Speaker 1>Jonathan talked about this a bit.</v>

51
00:02:08.251 --> 00:02:12.120
<v Speaker 1>Unless you have a central pole around which you're all oriented,</v>

52
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.680
<v Speaker 1>it's all chaotic and confused and you're in constant conflict and warfare.</v>

53
00:02:16.681 --> 00:02:18.660
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's a bad thing you do.</v>

54
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:19.860
<v Speaker 1>You do not want that.</v>

55
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.380
<v Speaker 1>And you're all confused individually and all of that.</v>

56
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.850
<v Speaker 1>That's a state of chaos.</v>

57
00:02:23.851 --> 00:02:24.840
<v Speaker 1>It's unbearable.</v>

58
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.480
<v Speaker 1>But if you tighten up the group identity too,</v>

59
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.430
<v Speaker 1>great a degree,</v>

60
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.050
<v Speaker 1>say like the Nazis tried to do,</v>

61
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.310
<v Speaker 1>then the probability that you'll come to blows with other groups reaches a</v>

62
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.380
<v Speaker 1>almost a point of certainty.</v>

63
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.160
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

64
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.400
<v Speaker 1>And so it seemed to me that human beings were damned if they did and damned if</v>

65
00:02:41.401 --> 00:02:42.234
<v Speaker 1>they didn't.</v>

66
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.690
<v Speaker 1>On the,</v>

67
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.381
<v Speaker 1>on the one hand,</v>

68
00:02:43.381 --> 00:02:45.120
<v Speaker 1>if you dropped your group identity,</v>

69
00:02:45.121 --> 00:02:47.730
<v Speaker 1>then you fragmented and degenerated into the chaos.</v>

70
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.640
<v Speaker 1>And if you gripped hard to your group identity,</v>

71
00:02:50.641 --> 00:02:51.490
<v Speaker 1>then you,</v>

72
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.020
<v Speaker 1>you tilted towards totalitarianism and group conflict.</v>

73
00:02:55.021 --> 00:02:55.831
<v Speaker 1>And then I thought,</v>

74
00:02:55.831 --> 00:03:00.250
<v Speaker 1>well that was okay in the past to tilt towards group conflict because you know,</v>

75
00:03:00.251 --> 00:03:01.810
<v Speaker 1>when we had sticks and swords,</v>

76
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.620
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

77
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.490
<v Speaker 1>we'd have a war in,</v>

78
00:03:03.491 --> 00:03:05.890
<v Speaker 1>lots of people would get killed and lots of people would get hurt,</v>

79
00:03:05.891 --> 00:03:08.680
<v Speaker 1>but the entire planet wouldn't burst into flames.</v>

80
00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:08.981
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

81
00:03:08.981 --> 00:03:10.180
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

82
00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:10.411
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

83
00:03:10.411 --> 00:03:10.880
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

84
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.010
<v Speaker 1>this inborn</v>

85
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:14.650
<v Speaker 1>dichotomy of,</v>

86
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.060
<v Speaker 1>of catastrophe that characterized human existence wasn't something that could</v>

87
00:03:19.061 --> 00:03:21.100
<v Speaker 1>spiral into complete destruction.</v>

88
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.750
<v Speaker 1>And so we could get away with it.</v>

89
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.880
<v Speaker 1>But now in a thermonuclear age,</v>

90
00:03:24.881 --> 00:03:26.500
<v Speaker 1>it's like we can't get away with it,</v>

91
00:03:26.501 --> 00:03:28.000
<v Speaker 1>but that's still what we're like.</v>

92
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.710
<v Speaker 1>We're still like that.</v>

93
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.600
<v Speaker 1>And so for months I thought,</v>

94
00:03:31.601 --> 00:03:32.270
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

95
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.840
<v Speaker 1>I always believed that if you could get to the bottom of a problem,</v>

96
00:03:34.841 --> 00:03:35.860
<v Speaker 1>you could solve it.</v>

97
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.890
<v Speaker 1>Cause that that was sort of the definition of getting to the bottom of it.</v>

98
00:03:38.891 --> 00:03:39.180
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

99
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.850
<v Speaker 1>you get solution would emerge.</v>

100
00:03:40.851 --> 00:03:42.790
<v Speaker 1>And when I got to the bottom of it,</v>

101
00:03:42.791 --> 00:03:43.630
<v Speaker 1>as far as I could go,</v>

102
00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:44.464
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

103
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.741
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

104
00:03:44.741 --> 00:03:49.630
<v Speaker 1>it's group identity and like group fostered warfare and catastrophe on the one</v>

105
00:03:49.631 --> 00:03:52.120
<v Speaker 1>hand and degenerate nihilism on the other.</v>

106
00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.541
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

107
00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:54.070
<v Speaker 1>well jigs up.</v>

108
00:03:54.071 --> 00:03:55.270
<v Speaker 1>There's no way out of that.</v>

109
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.480
<v Speaker 1>And I had a prophetic dream at that point,</v>

110
00:03:58.481 --> 00:03:58.691
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

111
00:03:58.691 --> 00:04:00.340
<v Speaker 1>and I won't tell you the details of that,</v>

112
00:04:00.341 --> 00:04:04.570
<v Speaker 1>but it outlined a third path to me that,</v>

113
00:04:04.571 --> 00:04:07.900
<v Speaker 1>that I had already picked up to some degree from reading young and also Eric</v>

114
00:04:07.901 --> 00:04:08.734
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>

115
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.780
<v Speaker 1>who is one of Young's great students.</v>

116
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:12.460
<v Speaker 1>And that was,</v>

117
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.540
<v Speaker 1>that had to do with the embodiment of the idea of the hero and the individual as</v>

118
00:04:16.541 --> 00:04:21.541
<v Speaker 1>the like the pathway of the courageous individual as the mediating force between</v>

119
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.710
<v Speaker 1>the chaos of nihilism and the totalitarian and totalitarianism of authority,</v>

120
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:27.580
<v Speaker 1>authority,</v>

121
00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.760
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian certainty that there was a third path.</v>

122
00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.390
<v Speaker 1>And then I started to understand its relationship to religious thinking,</v>

123
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:35.860
<v Speaker 1>mostly to Christianity,</v>

124
00:04:35.861 --> 00:04:37.600
<v Speaker 1>but partly because that's my tradition,</v>

125
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

126
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.690
<v Speaker 1>in so far as I'm a western person say,</v>

127
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.690
<v Speaker 1>and I understood as well that it had something to do.</v>

128
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.540
<v Speaker 1>And this was what it was dramatized in the,</v>

129
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:47.590
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

130
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:48.300
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

131
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

132
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.270
<v Speaker 1>in the passion story in the New Testament was that it had something to do with</v>

133
00:04:52.271 --> 00:04:57.220
<v Speaker 1>taking responsibility for malevolence because Christ is architecturally the</v>

134
00:04:57.221 --> 00:05:00.310
<v Speaker 1>person who takes the world's sins upon himself.</v>

135
00:05:00.311 --> 00:05:03.970
<v Speaker 1>And what that means in some sense is that if you read about history,</v>

136
00:05:03.971 --> 00:05:05.140
<v Speaker 1>read about Nazi Germany,</v>

137
00:05:05.141 --> 00:05:06.820
<v Speaker 1>you read about the Soviet Gulags,</v>

138
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.770
<v Speaker 1>you don't read as a observer looking at what other people have done.</v>

139
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.730
<v Speaker 1>You read as the subject and the object of the history.</v>

140
00:05:15.731 --> 00:05:17.920
<v Speaker 1>You're both the person who was persecuted.</v>

141
00:05:17.921 --> 00:05:19.810
<v Speaker 1>And the victimizer at the same time.</v>

142
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.491
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>

143
00:05:20.491 --> 00:05:24.850
<v Speaker 1>you have to see both of those inside us actual forces in order to understand</v>

144
00:05:24.851 --> 00:05:25.750
<v Speaker 1>history properly.</v>

145
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.490
<v Speaker 1>And of course that's a very,</v>

146
00:05:27.491 --> 00:05:29.170
<v Speaker 1>very terrifying thing to do.</v>

147
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.930
<v Speaker 1>It's easier to take the part of victim in some sense,</v>

148
00:05:31.931 --> 00:05:33.280
<v Speaker 1>even though that's terrible,</v>

149
00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.551
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

150
00:05:33.551 --> 00:05:36.100
<v Speaker 1>Because who wants to be the victim of a concentration camp?</v>

151
00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.091
<v Speaker 1>Obviously,</v>

152
00:05:37.091 --> 00:05:40.780
<v Speaker 1>but maybe that's preferable ethically to being the perpetrator.</v>

153
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.520
<v Speaker 1>But when you're reading about Auschwitz,</v>

154
00:05:42.521 --> 00:05:46.330
<v Speaker 1>you're not reading about past history of your reading about exactly what people</v>

155
00:05:46.331 --> 00:05:47.164
<v Speaker 1>are like.</v>

156
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.000
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very terrifying thing.</v>

157
00:05:49.001 --> 00:05:53.500
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things you have to do if you're going to take responsibility</v>

158
00:05:53.501 --> 00:05:56.890
<v Speaker 1>for the nature of your being is to take responsibility for the,</v>

159
00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.480
<v Speaker 1>that's truly part of human nature.</v>

160
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:00.440
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

161
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.710
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the encounter with the shadow from the union perspective.</v>

162
00:06:03.711 --> 00:06:04.371
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

163
00:06:04.371 --> 00:06:07.880
<v Speaker 1>one of Ewing's proposition was that the human shadow reaches all the way down to</v>

164
00:06:07.881 --> 00:06:08.714
<v Speaker 1>hell.</v>

165
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:09.643
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

166
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.920
<v Speaker 1>we're used to thinking of religious language maybe even as outdated</v>

167
00:06:15.081 --> 00:06:15.891
<v Speaker 1>superstition.</v>

168
00:06:15.891 --> 00:06:19.460
<v Speaker 1>But if you take that sort of statement seriously from a psychological</v>

169
00:06:19.461 --> 00:06:20.031
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

170
00:06:20.031 --> 00:06:24.230
<v Speaker 1>what it means in some sense is that the malevolence that resides inside you,</v>

171
00:06:24.231 --> 00:06:25.580
<v Speaker 1>at least in potential,</v>

172
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:30.110
<v Speaker 1>is of the same sort as the malevolence that produces the worst things that human</v>

173
00:06:30.111 --> 00:06:31.610
<v Speaker 1>beings have ever done.</v>
