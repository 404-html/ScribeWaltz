1
00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:07.690
<v Speaker 1>So that you,</v>

2
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.050
<v Speaker 1>you touched on this idea of the destruction of the work of art.</v>

3
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:11.891
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4
00:00:11.891 --> 00:00:14.490
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things I really liked about reading Nietzsche,</v>

5
00:00:14.491 --> 00:00:16.510
<v Speaker 1>it was his discussion of into mall,</v>

6
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.781
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

7
00:00:16.781 --> 00:00:17.561
<v Speaker 1>of resentment.</v>

8
00:00:17.561 --> 00:00:18.310
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

9
00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.780
<v Speaker 1>and it seems to me that a tremendous amount of the motive power that drives the</v>

10
00:00:22.781 --> 00:00:23.680
<v Speaker 1>postmodernist,</v>

11
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:24.543
<v Speaker 1>let's call it,</v>

12
00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:26.080
<v Speaker 1>it's not a revolution.</v>

13
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:27.430
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

14
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.430
<v Speaker 1>transformation seems to me to be driven by resentment about virtually anything</v>

15
00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:33.370
<v Speaker 1>that has any,</v>

16
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.091
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

17
00:00:34.091 --> 00:00:34.781
<v Speaker 1>what would you say?</v>

18
00:00:34.781 --> 00:00:37.330
<v Speaker 1>Any merit of competence or aesthetic quality?</v>

19
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.310
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know if that's,</v>

20
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.660
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that that's partly rooted in the academics disdain for the</v>

21
00:00:43.661 --> 00:00:44.620
<v Speaker 1>business world,</v>

22
00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.890
<v Speaker 1>which I think is driven by their relative economic inequality.</v>

23
00:00:47.891 --> 00:00:52.510
<v Speaker 1>Because most people who are as intelligent as academics are from a pure Iq point</v>

24
00:00:52.511 --> 00:00:53.170
<v Speaker 1>of view,</v>

25
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.000
<v Speaker 1>make more money in the private sphere.</v>

26
00:00:55.001 --> 00:00:56.590
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that drives some of it,</v>

27
00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.330
<v Speaker 1>but there also seems to be this,</v>

28
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.690
<v Speaker 1>there's a destruction and aim for destruction of the,</v>

29
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.640
<v Speaker 1>of the aesthetic quality of the,</v>

30
00:01:03.641 --> 00:01:05.500
<v Speaker 1>of the literary or artistic work.</v>

31
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.650
<v Speaker 1>It's reduction to nothing but some kind of power game.</v>

32
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.530
<v Speaker 1>And then surrounding that,</v>

33
00:01:11.531 --> 00:01:15.010
<v Speaker 1>the reduction of everything to something that approximates a power gate,</v>

34
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.560
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

35
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.790
<v Speaker 1>which I can't help but identifying with,</v>

36
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.170
<v Speaker 1>with jealousy and resentment as a,</v>

37
00:01:20.171 --> 00:01:21.520
<v Speaker 1>as a fundamental motivator.</v>

38
00:01:21.521 --> 00:01:23.200
<v Speaker 1>Does that seem reasonable to you?</v>

39
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.500
<v Speaker 2>These professors?</v>

40
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.801
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

41
00:01:24.801 --> 00:01:27.750
<v Speaker 2>Who allege that art is nothing.</v>

42
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.890
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

43
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.400
<v Speaker 2>But an ideological movement by one elite.</v>

44
00:01:31.401 --> 00:01:32.234
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

45
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.023
<v Speaker 2>Against the,</v>

46
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.050
<v Speaker 2>I guess another group,</v>

47
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.590
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

48
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.080
<v Speaker 2>These people are Philistines the Philistines,</v>

49
00:01:39.081 --> 00:01:41.720
<v Speaker 2>they're middlebrow hopelessly middlebrow.</v>

50
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.871
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

51
00:01:41.871 --> 00:01:42.081
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

52
00:01:42.081 --> 00:01:42.530
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

53
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.940
<v Speaker 2>they have no sense of beauty.</v>

54
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.350
<v Speaker 2>They have no sense of the aesthetic.</v>

55
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.531
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

56
00:01:45.531 --> 00:01:47.660
<v Speaker 2>Marxism doesn't deed a search this,</v>

57
00:01:47.661 --> 00:01:48.090
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

58
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.760
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] and tries to reconfigure the universe in terms of materialism,</v>

59
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:53.511
<v Speaker 2>it seems to it,</v>

60
00:01:53.511 --> 00:01:56.720
<v Speaker 2>and it does not recognize any kind of spiritual dimension.</v>

61
00:01:56.721 --> 00:01:56.900
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

62
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:57.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm an atheist,</v>

63
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.040
<v Speaker 2>but I see the great world religions as enormous works of art as the,</v>

64
00:02:03.831 --> 00:02:04.300
<v Speaker 2>as the,</v>

65
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.500
<v Speaker 2>as the best way to understand the universe and man's place in it.</v>

66
00:02:07.501 --> 00:02:07.790
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

67
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.560
<v Speaker 2>I find them enormously moving that they're there.</v>

68
00:02:10.561 --> 00:02:11.810
<v Speaker 2>They're like enormous Paul.</v>

69
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:12.653
<v Speaker 2>Unless I had them,</v>

70
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:13.500
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

71
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.590
<v Speaker 2>I have called for the true revolution.</v>

72
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.130
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

73
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.810
<v Speaker 2>What have been okay to make the core curriculum of world education the world?</v>

74
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.380
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

75
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.000
<v Speaker 2>The great religions of the world.</v>

76
00:02:23.001 --> 00:02:25.700
<v Speaker 2>I feel that is the only way to achieve an understanding.</v>

77
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.050
<v Speaker 2>And it's also a way to,</v>

78
00:02:27.051 --> 00:02:27.500
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

79
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.711
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

80
00:02:27.711 --> 00:02:28.730
<v Speaker 2>to present the aesthetic.</v>

81
00:02:28.731 --> 00:02:28.941
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

82
00:02:28.941 --> 00:02:30.620
<v Speaker 2>Because I feel that that the,</v>

83
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.360
<v Speaker 2>that the real sixties' vision was about Xcel,</v>

84
00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:35.540
<v Speaker 2>Taishan elevation,</v>

85
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.190
<v Speaker 2>cosmic consciousness,</v>

86
00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.110
<v Speaker 2>all of these things,</v>

87
00:02:39.111 --> 00:02:40.400
<v Speaker 2>they were rejected.</v>

88
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.580
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

89
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.391
<v Speaker 2>By these,</v>

90
00:02:41.391 --> 00:02:43.100
<v Speaker 2>by these midgets.</v>

91
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.371
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

92
00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:47.300
<v Speaker 2>Intellectual midgets who seized onto la car dairy and fuck off.</v>

93
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.630
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

94
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:48.520
<v Speaker 2>It's an eye,</v>

95
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.330
<v Speaker 2>my career has been in the art school,</v>

96
00:02:50.331 --> 00:02:53.330
<v Speaker 2>so I Ma Ma my entire career beginning of Bennington college.</v>

97
00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.980
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

98
00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:54.361
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>

99
00:02:54.361 --> 00:02:57.710
<v Speaker 2>I represent a challenge to this from the perspective of art.</v>

100
00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:58.120
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

101
00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 2>It is an absolute nonsense.</v>

102
00:03:00.071 --> 00:03:00.341
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

103
00:03:00.341 --> 00:03:04.990
<v Speaker 2>As poststructuralism maintains that reality is mediated by language,</v>

104
00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:05.621
<v Speaker 2>by words,</v>

105
00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:06.490
<v Speaker 2>everything that we can know,</v>

106
00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:07.330
<v Speaker 2>including gender,</v>

107
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.280
<v Speaker 2>it's absolutely madness because I,</v>

108
00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:12.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm teaching students whose majors our ceramics.</v>

109
00:03:12.911 --> 00:03:13.540
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

110
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.650
<v Speaker 2>Or dance.</v>

111
00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:15.484
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

112
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.500
<v Speaker 2>Who are jazz musicians who understand reality in terms of the body is sensory</v>

113
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.933
<v Speaker 2>activation.</v>

114
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.660
<v Speaker 2>So they now to see what happens if something was going on in the art world as</v>

115
00:03:25.661 --> 00:03:26.320
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

116
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.690
<v Speaker 2>I identify with Andy Warhol and pop art.</v>

117
00:03:28.691 --> 00:03:28.841
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

118
00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:31.720
<v Speaker 2>That was what was going on during my years in college.</v>

119
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.760
<v Speaker 2>Everything about Andy Warhol was like,</v>

120
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:34.900
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

121
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:35.890
<v Speaker 2>Admiration.</v>

122
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:36.730
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

123
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.280
<v Speaker 2>What happened immediately after that in the arts?</v>

124
00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.360
<v Speaker 2>1970s okay.</v>

125
00:03:40.361 --> 00:03:44.410
<v Speaker 2>Was this collapse into a snide sort of postmodernism?</v>

126
00:03:44.411 --> 00:03:44.950
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

127
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.950
<v Speaker 2>this happened in the art world and it was an utter misunderstanding of culture.</v>

128
00:03:50.681 --> 00:03:55.681
<v Speaker 2>It seems to mean by that movement in the art world that is oppositional art,</v>

129
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:56.740
<v Speaker 2>in my view,</v>

130
00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:57.670
<v Speaker 2>is dead.</v>

131
00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.940
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

132
00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.490
<v Speaker 2>It's been and what postmodernism is,</v>

133
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.060
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

134
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.130
<v Speaker 2>A pathetic attempt to continue.</v>

135
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.260
<v Speaker 2>The old hero is some of the Avalon garb.</v>

136
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.100
<v Speaker 2>The avant garde was genuinely heroic from the early 19th century.</v>

137
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.341
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

138
00:04:09.341 --> 00:04:09.511
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>

139
00:04:09.511 --> 00:04:10.344
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about,</v>

140
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.631
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

141
00:04:10.631 --> 00:04:11.530
<v Speaker 2>when the core bay,</v>

142
00:04:11.531 --> 00:04:12.364
<v Speaker 2>the realist,</v>

143
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:12.641
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

144
00:04:12.641 --> 00:04:14.600
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about Monet and the impressions,</v>

145
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.460
<v Speaker 2>people who genuinely suffered for the radical ideas and new innovations and so</v>

146
00:04:18.461 --> 00:04:19.000
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

147
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.050
<v Speaker 2>going right down to,</v>

148
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.330
<v Speaker 2>to to Picasso and down to a,</v>

149
00:04:22.331 --> 00:04:25.510
<v Speaker 2>to Jackson Pollock who like was w who truly suffer it.</v>

150
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.660
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

151
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:26.130
<v Speaker 2>For him,</v>

152
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.920
<v Speaker 2>for his art,</v>

153
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.300
<v Speaker 2>it was only after his death.</v>

154
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.541
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

155
00:04:28.541 --> 00:04:31.750

156
00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.750
<v Speaker 2>Pop Art killed the avant garde.</v>

157
00:04:34.751 --> 00:04:36.700
<v Speaker 2>The idea that the avant garde continues.</v>

158
00:04:36.701 --> 00:04:39.250
<v Speaker 2>It's an absolute delusion of the contemporary art world,</v>

159
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.110
<v Speaker 2>which feels that it must attack attack,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

163
00:04:42.641 --> 00:04:43.050
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

164
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.321
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

165
00:04:43.321 --> 00:04:44.620
<v Speaker 2>the simplistic beliefs of the,</v>

166
00:04:44.621 --> 00:04:45.640
<v Speaker 2>of the Hoi Polloi.</v>

167
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:46.080
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

168
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.913
<v Speaker 2>Somehow the Arctic,</v>

170
00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:48.280
<v Speaker 2>Excuse me.</v>

171
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.840
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

172
00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:49.060

173
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.960
<v Speaker 2>From the moment.</v>

174
00:04:49.961 --> 00:04:50.201
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

175
00:04:50.201 --> 00:04:55.201
<v Speaker 2>Andy Warhol went through and embraced the popular media and in brick instead of</v>

176
00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:56.560
<v Speaker 2>having the opposition to it,</v>

177
00:04:56.561 --> 00:04:57.700
<v Speaker 2>the serious artists have had,</v>

178
00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.130
<v Speaker 2>that was the end of oppositional art.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

180
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.800
<v Speaker 2>So we've been going on now for 50 years.</v>

181
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.910
<v Speaker 2>The postmodernism and academia is hand in hand with the stupidity and</v>

182
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.640
<v Speaker 2>infantilism that masquerades as,</v>

183
00:05:09.641 --> 00:05:09.851
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

184
00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:10.091
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

185
00:05:10.091 --> 00:05:12.160
<v Speaker 2>as important art and galleries everywhere.</v>

186
00:05:12.161 --> 00:05:13.150
<v Speaker 2>This incredible,</v>

187
00:05:13.151 --> 00:05:13.960
<v Speaker 2>incredible,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

189
00:05:14.201 --> 00:05:16.540
<v Speaker 2>its mechanism of contemporary art,</v>

190
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.800
<v Speaker 2>of pushing things that are,</v>

191
00:05:17.801 --> 00:05:21.880
<v Speaker 2>that are so hopelessly derivative that [inaudible] with this idea that once</v>

192
00:05:21.881 --> 00:05:22.121
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

193
00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:24.730
<v Speaker 2>that the art world sometimes is a superior view of reality.</v>
