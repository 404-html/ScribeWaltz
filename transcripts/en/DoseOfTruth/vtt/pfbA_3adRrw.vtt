00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.333

<v Speaker 1>I agree with that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You agree with that?</v>

30
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.333

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

35

00:01:29.121 --> 00:01:29.954
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

37
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.970
<v Speaker 2>so I just had dinner with Jordan.</v>

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.690
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

54
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.410
<v Speaker 2>With a mallet over and over.</v>

55
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.760
<v Speaker 2>Who's your daddy?</v>

56
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:09.920
<v Speaker 2>Israeli.</v>

57
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.050
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

58
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.420
<v Speaker 2>I can see how many of you guys saw my,</v>

59
00:02:11.421 --> 00:02:11.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

60
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.500

<v Speaker 2>with Dr. Peterson.</v>

63
00:02:13.701 --> 00:02:14.534
<v Speaker 2>And eventually,</v>

64
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.191
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

65
00:02:22.191 --> 00:02:23.780
<v Speaker 2>it's funny because Jordan's got this,</v>

66
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.490
<v Speaker 2>this thing about the lobsters of course,</v>

67
00:02:25.491 --> 00:02:26.510
<v Speaker 2>that you guys all know about.</v>

68
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.700
<v Speaker 2>Ben Is an Orthodox Jew.</v>

69
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.420
<v Speaker 2>So literally for like an hour in the green room,</v>

70
00:02:33.421 --> 00:02:33.951
<v Speaker 2>Ben was like,</v>

71
00:02:33.951 --> 00:02:36.190
<v Speaker 2>could you just switch it to fulfill the vision plan?</v>

72
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.701
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

73
00:02:38.701 --> 00:02:40.050
<v Speaker 2>Now I know how many Jews are in the crowd.</v>

74
00:02:40.051 --> 00:02:40.380
<v Speaker 2>Very good.</v>

75
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.213
<v Speaker 1>Z.</v>

76
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.320
<v Speaker 2>Very good.</v>

77
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.840
<v Speaker 2>How many of you self identify as lobsters by the way?</v>

78
00:02:45.841 --> 00:02:46.830
<v Speaker 2>It's very important.</v>

79
00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

80
00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.580
<v Speaker 1>we got a lobster claw look at,</v>

81
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.830
<v Speaker 1>I was walking around with stuff.</v>

82
00:02:53.831 --> 00:02:54.611
<v Speaker 1>Lots of these people.</v>

83
00:02:54.611 --> 00:02:55.570
<v Speaker 1>Are we making a difference?</v>

84
00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.413
<v Speaker 1>You see my point</v>

85
00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:59.620
<v Speaker 2>there really is very,</v>

86
00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.180
<v Speaker 2>something amazing happening here.</v>

87
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.341
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

88
00:03:01.341 --> 00:03:02.240
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

89
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.591
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

90
00:03:02.591 --> 00:03:02.981
<v Speaker 2>it's funny,</v>

91
00:03:02.981 --> 00:03:04.180
<v Speaker 2>I actually,</v>

92
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.700
<v Speaker 2>and I think probably similar to many of you guys,</v>

93
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.740
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know who Jordan was until about a year and a half ago and he was last</v>

94
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:12.280
<v Speaker 2>October actually,</v>

95
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.700
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

96
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.900
<v Speaker 2>And suddenly,</v>

97
00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:15.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure for some of you guys that were doing it,</v>

98
00:03:15.551 --> 00:03:16.810
<v Speaker 2>people started tweeting at me,</v>

99
00:03:16.811 --> 00:03:16.961
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

100
00:03:16.961 --> 00:03:17.771
<v Speaker 2>you gotta talk to,</v>

101
00:03:17.771 --> 00:03:20.410
<v Speaker 2>this is Jordan Peterson guy up in Toronto.</v>

102
00:03:20.411 --> 00:03:21.880
<v Speaker 2>You gotta talk to this guy.</v>

103
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.170
<v Speaker 2>And we had him on my show and it was,</v>

104
00:03:23.171 --> 00:03:24.850
<v Speaker 2>we were building out our studio.</v>

105
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.210
<v Speaker 2>So we did a Google hangout and the connection wasn't great because we didn't</v>

106
00:03:28.211 --> 00:03:29.380
<v Speaker 2>have great internet yet.</v>

107
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.720
<v Speaker 2>And I'm,</v>

108
00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing this Google hangout with this guy.</v>

109
00:03:31.361 --> 00:03:34.810
<v Speaker 2>And I really was just learning about him as I was talking to him.</v>

110
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.650
<v Speaker 2>And here's this guy crying over Pinocchio.</v>

111
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.890
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

112
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:42.551
<v Speaker 2>Lion King.</v>

113
00:03:42.551 --> 00:03:43.390
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense to me.</v>

114
00:03:43.391 --> 00:03:45.160
<v Speaker 2>A little mermaid seeing I was hysterical,</v>

115
00:03:45.161 --> 00:03:47.340
<v Speaker 2>but crying over Pinocchio.</v>

116
00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.600
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

117
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.610
<v Speaker 2>what is going on here?</v>

118
00:03:48.611 --> 00:03:49.540
<v Speaker 2>What is this?</v>

119
00:03:49.541 --> 00:03:50.770
<v Speaker 2>What is this thing?</v>

120
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.200
<v Speaker 2>And I got to tell you guys had,</v>

121
00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.080
<v Speaker 2>in the last year,</v>

122
00:03:53.081 --> 00:03:55.630
<v Speaker 2>I have truly learned what this thing is,</v>

123
00:03:55.631 --> 00:03:55.900
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

124
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.330
<v Speaker 2>this guy is at the forefront.</v>

125
00:03:58.331 --> 00:04:01.500
<v Speaker 2>I think of what all the right ideas are right there.</v>

126
00:04:01.501 --> 00:04:03.670
<v Speaker 2>There are a lot of bad ideas out there.</v>

127
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:11.010
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

128
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.310
<v Speaker 2>Can plug good ideas.</v>

129
00:04:12.311 --> 00:04:12.930
<v Speaker 2>And that's right.</v>

130
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:13.270
<v Speaker 2>Where's the,</v>

131
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:14.940
<v Speaker 2>where's the girl that I was tweeting with before?</v>

132
00:04:14.941 --> 00:04:15.720
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

133
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.010
<v Speaker 2>I had that you deleted the tweet.</v>

134
00:04:17.011 --> 00:04:17.844
<v Speaker 2>Where are you?</v>

135
00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:19.470
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>

136
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.650
<v Speaker 2>Yo.</v>

137
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:20.400
<v Speaker 2>What up her clothing?</v>

138
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.910
<v Speaker 2>She made a mistake with Twitter and then I tweeted her and she deleted it and</v>

139
00:04:23.911 --> 00:04:24.744
<v Speaker 2>she's going through a line.</v>

140
00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:26.363
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

141

142
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.520
<v Speaker 1>I'll go back to China.</v>

143
00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.490
<v Speaker 2>If anyone should be building a wall.</v>

144
00:04:34.491 --> 00:04:35.440
<v Speaker 2>It's Canada and frankly,</v>

151
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.140
<v Speaker 2>like Trudeau could build anything</v>

152
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.130
<v Speaker 2>with Jordan.</v>

153
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.061
<v Speaker 2>He started,</v>

154
00:04:54.061 --> 00:04:54.211
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

155
00:04:54.211 --> 00:04:55.860
<v Speaker 2>there was this whole issue about the pronouns,</v>

156
00:04:55.861 --> 00:04:56.550
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

157
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.410
<v Speaker 2>That Jordan basically said,</v>

158
00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.440
<v Speaker 2>I am a free man of my own free will and free mind and the government cannot tell</v>

159
00:05:03.631 --> 00:05:05.130
<v Speaker 2>me what pronouns to use.</v>

160
00:05:05.131 --> 00:05:07.050
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean I dislike.</v>

161
00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:08.593
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

162
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:14.071
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

163
00:05:14.071 --> 00:05:14.580
<v Speaker 2>you got it.</v>

164
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.620
<v Speaker 2>You fully realized that this is a live show.</v>

165
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.513
<v Speaker 2>I like that.</v>

166
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:18.511
<v Speaker 2>No tape delay.</v>

167
00:05:18.511 --> 00:05:19.321
<v Speaker 2>Your applaud.</v>

168
00:05:19.321 --> 00:05:19.891
<v Speaker 2>Go crazy.</v>

169
00:05:19.891 --> 00:05:21.570
<v Speaker 2>You can scream whatever you want to do.</v>

170
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:23.281
<v Speaker 2>Thank you,</v>

171
00:05:23.281 --> 00:05:24.114
<v Speaker 2>sir.</v>

172
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:25.643
<v Speaker 2>Thank you very much.</v>

173
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:26.610
<v Speaker 2>My parents are here.</v>

174
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.473
<v Speaker 2>This is this.</v>

175
00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.510
<v Speaker 1>What'd I tell your mom?</v>

176
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.971
<v Speaker 2>Good night.</v>

177
00:05:32.971 --> 00:05:33.291
<v Speaker 2>You too.</v>

178
00:05:33.291 --> 00:05:33.421
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

179
00:05:33.421 --> 00:05:34.254
<v Speaker 2>it's going to work out</v>

180
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.153
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

181
00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.810
<v Speaker 2>But really old Jordan wanted to do is the exact same thing that any of us want</v>

182
00:05:41.811 --> 00:05:42.021
<v Speaker 2>to do,</v>

183
00:05:42.021 --> 00:05:43.370
<v Speaker 2>which is exercise our mind.</v>

184
00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.560
<v Speaker 2>Be able to think the way we think,</v>

185
00:05:45.561 --> 00:05:47.630
<v Speaker 2>be able to speak the way we speak,</v>

186
00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:48.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

187
00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.490
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

188
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.200
<v Speaker 2>and to understand what the issues of the day are.</v>

189
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:53.540
<v Speaker 2>And since then in this last year,</v>

190
00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:53.931
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

191
00:05:53.931 --> 00:05:55.220
<v Speaker 2>I can go down the list of,</v>

192
00:05:55.221 --> 00:05:56.570
<v Speaker 2>of the people that you know,</v>

193
00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:57.500
<v Speaker 2>Eric,</v>

194
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.790
<v Speaker 2>who I'm sure maybe you guys know,</v>

195
00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:59.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

196
00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.811
<v Speaker 2>coined this phrase,</v>

197
00:05:59.811 --> 00:06:04.160
<v Speaker 2>the intellectual dark web and there is something happening and you guys are part</v>

198
00:06:04.161 --> 00:06:04.460
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>

199
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.820
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

200
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:05.760
<v Speaker 2>that's the beauty of it.</v>

201
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.070
<v Speaker 2>You guys are part of it.</v>

202
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.110
<v Speaker 2>But this guy right here,</v>

203
00:06:12.111 --> 00:06:12.681
<v Speaker 2>he really,</v>

204
00:06:12.681 --> 00:06:13.321
<v Speaker 2>I think is,</v>

205
00:06:13.321 --> 00:06:14.360
<v Speaker 2>is the center of it.</v>

206
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.691
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

207
00:06:14.691 --> 00:06:15.524
<v Speaker 2>this guy's got,</v>

208
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.450
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the number one book in the world.</v>

209
00:06:17.451 --> 00:06:18.284
<v Speaker 2>I mean Bible.</v>

210
00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:19.293
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>

211
00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:20.223
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

212
00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say something else.</v>

213
00:06:22.991 --> 00:06:23.171
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

214
00:06:23.171 --> 00:06:26.470
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people ask me what I do college gigs or I'm out on the street or</v>

215
00:06:26.471 --> 00:06:26.711
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

216
00:06:26.711 --> 00:06:30.280
<v Speaker 2>People will ask me about Jordan and they always asked me what does he get the</v>

217
00:06:30.281 --> 00:06:31.114
<v Speaker 2>same,</v>

218
00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

219
00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:32.530
<v Speaker 2>off camera.</v>

220
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:33.161
<v Speaker 2>Is He the same?</v>

221
00:06:33.161 --> 00:06:34.060
<v Speaker 2>And I got to tell you guys,</v>

222
00:06:34.061 --> 00:06:36.340
<v Speaker 2>I know Jordan pretty well now and it had,</v>

223
00:06:36.341 --> 00:06:40.450
<v Speaker 2>it's been an honor and a pleasure getting to know him and he truly is the same.</v>

224
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.630
<v Speaker 2>He talks as fast when he's off camera,</v>

225
00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.030
<v Speaker 2>he moves his hands possibly even more when we're together,</v>

226
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.610
<v Speaker 2>Andy and he cares about this stuff and he is living this stuff.</v>

227
00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:52.623
<v Speaker 2>And you know what,</v>

228
00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:53.770
<v Speaker 2>just in the last couple of weeks,</v>

229
00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:57.160
<v Speaker 2>how many you guys saw all these ridiculous hit pieces about Jordan?</v>

230
00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:58.460
<v Speaker 2>Just last couple of</v>

231
00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.770
<v Speaker 2>people just tell her all right.</v>

232
00:07:04.771 --> 00:07:07.740
<v Speaker 2>Like just these endlessly hysterical,</v>

233
00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:08.730
<v Speaker 2>dishonest.</v>

234
00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:12.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean the phrase that I've been using is that these people are activists,</v>

235
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:13.240
<v Speaker 2>not journalist.</v>

236
00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:14.940
<v Speaker 2>And I was really trying to think,</v>

237
00:07:14.941 --> 00:07:15.600
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

238
00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.440
<v Speaker 2>well for years,</v>

239
00:07:16.441 --> 00:07:17.340
<v Speaker 2>these last two years,</v>

240
00:07:17.341 --> 00:07:19.860
<v Speaker 2>this guy has caught fire and it's like,</v>

241
00:07:19.861 --> 00:07:20.071
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

242
00:07:20.071 --> 00:07:20.910
<v Speaker 2>where are you guys?</v>

243
00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.010
<v Speaker 2>Where were you when,</v>

244
00:07:22.011 --> 00:07:26.460
<v Speaker 2>when we were all having these conversations and then suddenly they get it right</v>

245
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:27.990
<v Speaker 2>and then they don't know what to do with it.</v>

246
00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.010
<v Speaker 2>And the reason they don't know what to do with it do what to do with it is</v>

247
00:07:32.011 --> 00:07:34.680
<v Speaker 2>because he's talking about personal responsibility.</v>

248
00:07:34.681 --> 00:07:37.110
<v Speaker 2>What are these 12 rules that Jordan's going to talk about tonight?</v>

249
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:37.920
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

250
00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:38.753
<v Speaker 2>Sit Up Straight,</v>

251
00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:39.870
<v Speaker 2>get your shit together.</v>

252
00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:40.790
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

253
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:41.241
<v Speaker 2>and that's it.</v>

254
00:07:41.241 --> 00:07:42.450
<v Speaker 2>That's a beautiful thing.</v>

255
00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:44.130
<v Speaker 2>But for the people that want to control you,</v>

256
00:07:44.131 --> 00:07:47.010
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing that they hate the most because they don't want you to get your</v>

257
00:07:47.011 --> 00:07:47.844
<v Speaker 2>shit together.</v>

258
00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:51.960
<v Speaker 2>And this guy being around him has forced me in some ways to get my shit</v>

259
00:07:51.961 --> 00:07:52.794
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

260
00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:54.180
<v Speaker 2>So with that in mind,</v>

261
00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:55.853
<v Speaker 2>are you ready?</v>

262
00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.840
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

263
00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:06.323
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

264
00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:07.460
<v Speaker 2>come on Chloe.</v>

265
00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:09.140
<v Speaker 2>I think he can get them to do a little better than that.</v>

266
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.320
<v Speaker 2>Glowing yellow.</v>

267
00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:11.751
<v Speaker 2>Little more than that.</v>

268
00:08:11.751 --> 00:08:12.560
<v Speaker 2>Can you a little more upbeat?</v>

269
00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:17.560
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

270
00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:26.580
<v Speaker 2>was really,</v>

271
00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:29.330
<v Speaker 2>there is an idea revolution happening in this country.</v>

272
00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:30.710
<v Speaker 2>You guys are part of it.</v>

273
00:08:30.711 --> 00:08:34.490
<v Speaker 2>But this guy right now is the center of it and it is my honor and pleasure to</v>

274
00:08:34.491 --> 00:08:36.350
<v Speaker 2>introduce Dr. Jordan Peterson.</v>

275
00:08:55.470 --> 00:09:00.470
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

276
00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:23.733
<v Speaker 1>you guys,</v>

277
00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:31.810
<v Speaker 3>you New Yorkers here.</v>

278
00:09:31.811 --> 00:09:32.840
<v Speaker 3>A real tough crowd.</v>

279
00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:39.183
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

280
00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.140
<v Speaker 3>If this is just completely ridiculous.</v>

281
00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:43.933
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

282
00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:45.763
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

283
00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:49.670
<v Speaker 3>I came here about an hour and a half ago and there were people like the lined up</v>

284
00:09:49.671 --> 00:09:50.450
<v Speaker 3>around the block.</v>

285
00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:50.890
<v Speaker 3>That's don't,</v>

286
00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:51.800
<v Speaker 3>what the hell are you doing?</v>

287
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:56.423
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

288
00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:57.480
<v Speaker 3>look at where it's at.</v>

289
00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:00.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm really looking forward to talking to you guys tonight.</v>

290
00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:01.143
<v Speaker 3>Really I,</v>

291
00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:02.223
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

292
00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:03.521
<v Speaker 3>I'm hoping,</v>

293
00:10:03.521 --> 00:10:04.310
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

294
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:05.900
<v Speaker 3>get right to the bottom of the things.</v>

295
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.360
<v Speaker 3>That's the plan.</v>

296
00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:12.200
<v Speaker 3>So if I'm going to just launch right into it,</v>

297
00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:14.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to talk to you about my book tonight.</v>

298
00:10:14.751 --> 00:10:15.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go,</v>

299
00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to try to go through all 12 rules.</v>

300
00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:22.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

301
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.640
<v Speaker 3>Try not to get too digressive while I'm doing it.</v>

302
00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:27.260
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

303
00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:32.260
<v Speaker 3>each time I do this I try to hit it from a different angle and to expand on the</v>

304
00:10:32.421 --> 00:10:34.430
<v Speaker 3>story to make it clearer and all of that.</v>

305
00:10:34.431 --> 00:10:37.880
<v Speaker 3>So I'm gonna try to do that again tonight and start with rule one.</v>

306
00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.360
<v Speaker 3>How am I heard somebody has lobster cause logs through teacher.</v>

307
00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:47.240
<v Speaker 3>That's just quite a many ridiculous things that have been happening.</v>

308
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:52.850
<v Speaker 3>But you know the first chapter which is stand up straight with your shoulders</v>

309
00:10:52.851 --> 00:10:53.190
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

310
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:53.900
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

311
00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:54.060
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

312
00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:57.220
<v Speaker 3>there's a variety of themes that I was trying to weave together.</v>

313
00:10:57.221 --> 00:11:02.221
<v Speaker 3>And I think that there the three themes or something like hierarchy,</v>

314
00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.040
<v Speaker 3>inequality and the vulnerability.</v>

315
00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:07.420
<v Speaker 3>It's something like that.</v>

316
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:11.530
<v Speaker 3>And I will start with hierarchy because it's really,</v>

317
00:11:11.531 --> 00:11:12.980
<v Speaker 3>really an important issue to tie.</v>

318
00:11:12.981 --> 00:11:14.370
<v Speaker 3>Didn't take really into the issue of,</v>

319
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:15.491
<v Speaker 3>of inequality.</v>

320
00:11:15.491 --> 00:11:16.780
<v Speaker 3>But I'll start with hierarchy.</v>

321
00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:17.853
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

322
00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:22.300
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that Carl Marx suggested 100 years ago,</v>

323
00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:23.800
<v Speaker 3>150 years ago,</v>

324
00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:28.390
<v Speaker 3>and not really all that originally because other people had made the same kind</v>

325
00:11:28.391 --> 00:11:30.370
<v Speaker 3>of comments was that uh,</v>

326
00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:34.330
<v Speaker 3>wealth tends to accumulate in the hands of fewer and fewer people.</v>

327
00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:38.180
<v Speaker 3>And he regarded that as evidence of,</v>

328
00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:42.160
<v Speaker 3>of a certain type of profound unfairness APP.</v>

329
00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:43.210
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

330
00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:45.160
<v Speaker 3>you have to give the devil his due.</v>

331
00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:46.540
<v Speaker 3>You really do.</v>

332
00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:51.580
<v Speaker 3>You can't make the arguments of those who stand in opposition to you week.</v>

333
00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:53.740
<v Speaker 3>It's foolish.</v>

334
00:11:53.741 --> 00:11:57.190
<v Speaker 3>You have to make them strong because then if you counter them,</v>

335
00:11:57.191 --> 00:11:59.770
<v Speaker 3>you've covered them in the best possible manner.</v>

336
00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:01.330
<v Speaker 3>And the thing about marks,</v>

337
00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.670
<v Speaker 3>observation is that it was correct.</v>

338
00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.900
<v Speaker 3>Wealth does tend to accumulate in the hands of fewer and fewer people.</v>

339
00:12:07.901 --> 00:12:09.670
<v Speaker 3>Now having said that,</v>

340
00:12:09.671 --> 00:12:14.671
<v Speaker 3>there's some complexities about that that absolutely 100% has to be addressed.</v>

341
00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:21.310
<v Speaker 3>The first is that it's not always in the hands of the same people.</v>

342
00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:24.430
<v Speaker 3>So if you look at how many distributes itself,</v>

343
00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:25.750
<v Speaker 3>imagine you're playing monopoly,</v>

344
00:12:25.751 --> 00:12:27.220
<v Speaker 3>you guys have all played monopoly.</v>

345
00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:30.070
<v Speaker 3>Every monopoly game ends the same way,</v>

346
00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:31.203
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

347
00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:35.770
<v Speaker 3>Everybody who's playing except one person starves to death and I'm the one</v>

348
00:12:35.771 --> 00:12:37.540
<v Speaker 3>person gets everything right?</v>

349
00:12:37.541 --> 00:12:40.210
<v Speaker 3>But if you play 10 monopoly games that you find,</v>

350
00:12:40.211 --> 00:12:41.021
<v Speaker 3>it's very seldom,</v>

351
00:12:41.021 --> 00:12:45.800
<v Speaker 3>it's the same person who ends up our top across the entire set of 10 gauge and</v>

352
00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:46.210
<v Speaker 3>we're not.</v>

353
00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:50.320
<v Speaker 3>We actually has more in common with real life than you might think because</v>

354
00:12:50.321 --> 00:12:52.090
<v Speaker 3>monopoly is essentially a game of chance,</v>

355
00:12:52.091 --> 00:12:53.050
<v Speaker 3>but some skill in it.</v>

356
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:58.330
<v Speaker 3>But if you run a economic game like monopoly out to its logical conclusion,</v>

357
00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:01.660
<v Speaker 3>what happens is that one person ends up with everything and everyone else ends</v>

358
00:13:01.661 --> 00:13:02.494
<v Speaker 3>up with nothing.</v>

359
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:06.790
<v Speaker 3>That's actually a consequence of the randomness itself.</v>

360
00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:08.410
<v Speaker 3>And that's been modeled by the way,</v>

361
00:13:08.411 --> 00:13:11.710
<v Speaker 3>by people who call themselves econo physicists.</v>

362
00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:12.371
<v Speaker 3>Like who knows?</v>

363
00:13:12.371 --> 00:13:13.660
<v Speaker 3>But there's Econo physicists,</v>

364
00:13:13.661 --> 00:13:13.901
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

365
00:13:13.901 --> 00:13:15.670
<v Speaker 3>Who would know that those sorts of people exist.</v>

366
00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:17.980
<v Speaker 3>But they've used mathematical equations,</v>

367
00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:19.210
<v Speaker 3>mathematical equations,</v>

368
00:13:19.211 --> 00:13:23.050
<v Speaker 3>governing randomness to describe how many distributes itself in an economy.</v>

369
00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:24.790
<v Speaker 3>And it does just like monopoly.</v>

370
00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.190
<v Speaker 3>Now the real world's more complicated than monopoly.</v>

371
00:13:27.191 --> 00:13:28.960
<v Speaker 3>And it's not only a random game,</v>

372
00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:29.950
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

373
00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:30.480
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

374
00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.140
<v Speaker 3>but there's a fundamental point here.</v>

375
00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:35.170
<v Speaker 3>And the point is that in complex systems,</v>

376
00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.040
<v Speaker 3>inequality tends,</v>

377
00:13:36.041 --> 00:13:36.874
<v Speaker 3>do we merge?</v>

378
00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:41.770
<v Speaker 3>Now the problem with the Damn Marxists is that they laid out the feet of western</v>

379
00:13:41.771 --> 00:13:43.450
<v Speaker 3>civilization and capitalism.</v>

380
00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:44.470
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

381
00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:46.120
<v Speaker 3>that's a problem for two reasons.</v>

382
00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:49.510
<v Speaker 3>The first reason it's a problem is because it's simply not true.</v>

383
00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:51.310
<v Speaker 3>And that's actually a problem.</v>

384
00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:57.180
<v Speaker 3>The problem with inequality is way more serious then whatever problems,</v>

385
00:13:57.581 --> 00:13:59.530
<v Speaker 3>capitalism in western civilization,</v>

386
00:13:59.531 --> 00:14:01.630
<v Speaker 3>how our societies aren't perfect.</v>

387
00:14:01.631 --> 00:14:04.090
<v Speaker 3>But compared to most imperfect societies,</v>

388
00:14:04.091 --> 00:14:05.350
<v Speaker 3>they're pretty damn good.</v>

389
00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:06.850
<v Speaker 3>But the thing that,</v>

390
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:11.703
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

391
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:13.530
<v Speaker 1>they're being blamed for,</v>

392
00:14:13.531 --> 00:14:13.970
<v Speaker 1>it</v>

393
00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:15.520
<v Speaker 3>is not their fault.</v>

394
00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:18.490
<v Speaker 3>You cannot lay inequality at the feet of capitalism.</v>

395
00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:19.810
<v Speaker 3>And that's why I parked me,</v>

396
00:14:19.811 --> 00:14:24.400
<v Speaker 3>I wrote about lobsters because whatever you don't see might say about lobsters,</v>

397
00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.020
<v Speaker 3>they are not capitalists.</v>

398
00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:29.830
<v Speaker 3>They don't partake in a free market economy.</v>

399
00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:33.100
<v Speaker 3>And their societies aren't socio cultural constructs.</v>

400
00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.350
<v Speaker 3>None of that is even vaguely true.</v>

401
00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:37.270
<v Speaker 3>It's seriously not true.</v>

402
00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:41.560
<v Speaker 3>But they still have inequality and they still have hierarchies.</v>

403
00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:42.910
<v Speaker 3>And so what that means,</v>

404
00:14:42.911 --> 00:14:47.220
<v Speaker 3>and it's a point I make repeated like in the chapter is hierarchical data</v>

405
00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:50.260
<v Speaker 3>quality is at least a third of a billion years old.</v>

406
00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:52.160
<v Speaker 3>And so</v>

407
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:52.940
<v Speaker 4>one problem.</v>

408
00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.400
<v Speaker 4>So one of the problems with misdiagnosing,</v>

409
00:14:55.401 --> 00:14:59.840
<v Speaker 4>it's cost is that you lay it at the feet of a,</v>

410
00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:01.940
<v Speaker 4>of a system that is producing it,</v>

411
00:15:01.941 --> 00:15:04.220
<v Speaker 4>or is it producing it any more than any other system would.</v>

412
00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:05.891
<v Speaker 4>But the second is,</v>

413
00:15:05.891 --> 00:15:09.620
<v Speaker 4>is that you actually failed to take it as seriously as you need to take it if</v>

414
00:15:09.621 --> 00:15:10.910
<v Speaker 4>you're going to address it.</v>

415
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:12.980
<v Speaker 4>So because right or left,</v>

416
00:15:12.981 --> 00:15:15.770
<v Speaker 4>one thing we should all be able to agree on as far as I'm concerned,</v>

417
00:15:15.771 --> 00:15:16.370
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>

418
00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:21.370
<v Speaker 4>Having people stack up in poverty at the bottom of your hierarchy is not good.</v>

419
00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:23.150
<v Speaker 4>Like who likes that?</v>

420
00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:23.710
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

421
00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:23.990
<v Speaker 4>Cool.</v>

422
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:24.231
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

423
00:15:24.231 --> 00:15:25.550
<v Speaker 4>you see people marching,</v>

424
00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:27.050
<v Speaker 4>I'm against poverty.</v>

425
00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.940
<v Speaker 4>It's like really?</v>

426
00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.550
<v Speaker 4>Who is for a porphyry?</v>

427
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:32.510
<v Speaker 4>No know.</v>

428
00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:33.343
<v Speaker 4>It's not like,</v>

429
00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:34.640
<v Speaker 4>it's not like well off.</v>

430
00:15:34.641 --> 00:15:38.240
<v Speaker 4>People walk down the streets of New York saying they see someone homeless</v>

431
00:15:38.241 --> 00:15:40.790
<v Speaker 4>shivering away suffering off to the side.</v>

432
00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:41.360
<v Speaker 4>They're thinking,</v>

433
00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.193
<v Speaker 4>Hey man,</v>

434
00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:47.180
<v Speaker 4>strike one up for the capitalist is how people think.</v>

435
00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:49.130
<v Speaker 4>They think they,</v>

436
00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:49.650
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

437
00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:52.100
<v Speaker 4>they're hurt by it and they don't know what to do about it.</v>

438
00:15:52.101 --> 00:15:52.761
<v Speaker 4>They'll avoid it.</v>

439
00:15:52.761 --> 00:15:53.810
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they won't even look,</v>

440
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:54.920
<v Speaker 4>they don't know what to do,</v>

441
00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.910
<v Speaker 4>but they're not bloody wall celebrate again,</v>

442
00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.570
<v Speaker 4>perhaps they don't off her money.</v>

443
00:15:59.571 --> 00:15:59.891
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

444
00:15:59.891 --> 00:16:02.600
<v Speaker 4>And there's a variety of complex reasons for that.</v>

445
00:16:02.601 --> 00:16:06.290
<v Speaker 4>But that's at least in part because it's not obvious to me in a situation like</v>

446
00:16:06.291 --> 00:16:06.531
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

447
00:16:06.531 --> 00:16:09.290
<v Speaker 4>money directly help or at least it's not.</v>

448
00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:12.080
<v Speaker 4>It's not a foregone conclusion,</v>

449
00:16:12.081 --> 00:16:13.370
<v Speaker 4>but that's the proper solution.</v>

450
00:16:13.371 --> 00:16:17.450
<v Speaker 4>So no one likes poverty and the evidence on inequality has pretty strong.</v>

451
00:16:17.451 --> 00:16:19.040
<v Speaker 4>From the social science perspective,</v>

452
00:16:19.041 --> 00:16:24.041
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty clear that it doesn't matter what size unit of social analysis you</v>

453
00:16:24.771 --> 00:16:25.161
<v Speaker 4>use,</v>

454
00:16:25.161 --> 00:16:26.840
<v Speaker 4>whether it's city,</v>

455
00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:27.591
<v Speaker 4>neighborhood,</v>

456
00:16:27.591 --> 00:16:28.041
<v Speaker 4>city,</v>

457
00:16:28.041 --> 00:16:28.521
<v Speaker 4>state,</v>

458
00:16:28.521 --> 00:16:29.354
<v Speaker 4>or country.</v>

459
00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:31.190
<v Speaker 4>The more inequality there is,</v>

460
00:16:31.191 --> 00:16:36.191
<v Speaker 4>the more the society starts to destabilize and the more violent the men get.</v>

461
00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:40.490
<v Speaker 4>And that's also not good at the reason the men get fired just because men are</v>

462
00:16:40.491 --> 00:16:41.450
<v Speaker 4>more violent than women,</v>

463
00:16:41.451 --> 00:16:42.980
<v Speaker 4>and so they get violent first.</v>

464
00:16:42.981 --> 00:16:44.490
<v Speaker 4>But the ones at the bottom,</v>

465
00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:48.320
<v Speaker 4>the once you stack up at the bottom and don't see any way of potentially</v>

466
00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:49.580
<v Speaker 4>climbing to the top,</v>

467
00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:50.091
<v Speaker 4>they pay.</v>

468
00:16:50.091 --> 00:16:51.230
<v Speaker 4>I don't have anything to lose.</v>

469
00:16:51.231 --> 00:16:53.040
<v Speaker 4>I might as well throw the whole thing up in the air.</v>

470
00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:55.550
<v Speaker 4>Let's play a new monopoly game.</v>

471
00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:57.020
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I'll come out on top this time.</v>

472
00:16:57.310 --> 00:16:58.190
<v Speaker 4>And that's not good.</v>

473
00:16:58.191 --> 00:16:58.431
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

474
00:16:58.431 --> 00:17:00.410
<v Speaker 4>It's not good to have your society destabilized.</v>

475
00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:04.580
<v Speaker 4>So we know that there was some parameters within which our societies have to</v>

476
00:17:04.581 --> 00:17:06.650
<v Speaker 4>operate in order to maintain their stability.</v>

477
00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:08.150
<v Speaker 4>Everybody can agree on that,</v>

478
00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:11.870
<v Speaker 4>but enough with the misdiagnosis.</v>

479
00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:12.860
<v Speaker 4>That's my sense.</v>

480
00:17:12.861 --> 00:17:13.221
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

481
00:17:13.221 --> 00:17:14.054
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

482
00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:17.990
<v Speaker 4>we can have a discussion about inequality and we can agree that it can become a</v>

483
00:17:17.991 --> 00:17:18.824
<v Speaker 4>problem,</v>

484
00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:21.680
<v Speaker 4>but we're not going to blame it on capitalism and we're not going to blame it on</v>

485
00:17:21.681 --> 00:17:24.470
<v Speaker 4>the free market and we're not going to blame it on the patriarchy or Western</v>

486
00:17:24.471 --> 00:17:26.540
<v Speaker 4>civilization because that's just wrong.</v>

487
00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:35.960
<v Speaker 4>That's the first thing,</v>

488
00:17:35.961 --> 00:17:36.730
<v Speaker 4>and that's,</v>

489
00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:37.460
<v Speaker 4>that's really it.</v>

490
00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:38.750
<v Speaker 4>That's really an important site.</v>

491
00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:41.000
<v Speaker 4>Now the second thing is,</v>

492
00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:42.050
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

493
00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:44.560
<v Speaker 4>how do you best probably hunted?</v>

494
00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:49.780
<v Speaker 4>So we'll say that hierarchy is a permanent element of a social organization,</v>

495
00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:50.730
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

496
00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:53.580
<v Speaker 4>It runs through the the Kingdom of life.</v>

497
00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.790
<v Speaker 4>Any complex lifeforms organize themselves into a hierarchy.</v>

498
00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.040
<v Speaker 4>The winters tend to take more than the losers.</v>

499
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.540
<v Speaker 4>That's how it is now.</v>

500
00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.070
<v Speaker 4>I never once claimed,</v>

501
00:18:02.071 --> 00:18:04.260
<v Speaker 4>don't know why I'm being accused of claiming that.</v>

502
00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:04.590
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

503
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:05.550
<v Speaker 4>because that's how it is.</v>

504
00:18:05.551 --> 00:18:06.780
<v Speaker 4>That's how it should be.</v>

505
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:09.690
<v Speaker 4>It's like there's a big gap between the way things are,</v>

506
00:18:09.691 --> 00:18:10.860
<v Speaker 4>the way they should be.</v>

507
00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:13.500
<v Speaker 4>Any anyone knows that if they're the least fit,</v>

508
00:18:13.501 --> 00:18:14.830
<v Speaker 4>philosophically astute,</v>

509
00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:15.721
<v Speaker 4>you can't say,</v>

510
00:18:15.721 --> 00:18:18.240
<v Speaker 4>well there's beggars on the street and that's how it shouldn't be.</v>

511
00:18:18.241 --> 00:18:19.920
<v Speaker 4>It's like that's completely foolish.</v>

512
00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:21.240
<v Speaker 4>We want to,</v>

513
00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:25.520
<v Speaker 4>we want to ameliorate the worst parts of the what the,</v>

514
00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:27.790
<v Speaker 4>the painful elements of reality and so forth.</v>

515
00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.040
<v Speaker 4>And we're able to do that.</v>

516
00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:30.840
<v Speaker 4>But that's doesn't mean we know how to do it.</v>

517
00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:36.200
<v Speaker 4>There's a book that was just published by a guy named Walter shutdown called the</v>

518
00:18:36.811 --> 00:18:37.860
<v Speaker 4>great leveler,</v>

519
00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:39.390
<v Speaker 4>believe that's the name of it.</v>

520
00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:40.320
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

521
00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:40.771
<v Speaker 4>it was just,</v>

522
00:18:40.771 --> 00:18:42.830
<v Speaker 4>just came out and it's an analysis of inequality.</v>

523
00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:43.291
<v Speaker 4>It's quite,</v>

524
00:18:43.291 --> 00:18:44.280
<v Speaker 4>it's quite good.</v>

525
00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:44.570
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

526
00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:45.780
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of a technical book,</v>

527
00:18:45.781 --> 00:18:46.614
<v Speaker 4>but I'd recommend it.</v>

528
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:48.360
<v Speaker 4>One of the things shy did,</v>

529
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:49.320
<v Speaker 4>he was curious about,</v>

530
00:18:49.321 --> 00:18:49.920
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

531
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.960
<v Speaker 4>is there anything that can be done about inequality?</v>

532
00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:53.130
<v Speaker 4>And so here's a question,</v>

533
00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:55.260
<v Speaker 4>an empirical question and scientific question.</v>

534
00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:00.090
<v Speaker 4>Imagine that you stacked up left wing governments and it stacked up right wing</v>

535
00:19:00.091 --> 00:19:03.960
<v Speaker 4>governments and you measured the levels of inequality among the left wing</v>

536
00:19:03.961 --> 00:19:06.540
<v Speaker 4>governments and you measured levels of inequality among the right wing</v>

537
00:19:06.541 --> 00:19:07.374
<v Speaker 4>governments.</v>

538
00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:12.380
<v Speaker 4>You'd hope probably that there would be less inequality in the last week he</v>

539
00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:14.250
<v Speaker 4>societies because after all,</v>

540
00:19:14.251 --> 00:19:17.970
<v Speaker 4>what they're trying to do desperately is to decrease inequality among all sorts</v>

541
00:19:17.971 --> 00:19:18.540
<v Speaker 4>of other things.</v>

542
00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:19.240
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

543
00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:19.830
<v Speaker 4>as I said,</v>

544
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:20.880
<v Speaker 4>give the devil his due.</v>

545
00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:22.400
<v Speaker 4>They're trying to reduce inequality.</v>

546
00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:23.010
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

547
00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:23.581
<v Speaker 4>Shadelle phone.</v>

548
00:19:23.581 --> 00:19:26.730
<v Speaker 4>There was no relationship whatsoever between the political stance of the</v>

549
00:19:26.731 --> 00:19:31.731
<v Speaker 4>government levels of inequality and that that is not a finding to be.</v>

550
00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:34.313
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>

551
00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.720
<v Speaker 4>what would you say can be thankful about to be,</v>

552
00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:37.501
<v Speaker 4>to gloat about,</v>

553
00:19:37.501 --> 00:19:38.730
<v Speaker 4>to be happy about?</v>

554
00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:42.840
<v Speaker 4>It's actually really quite catastrophic because what it means is that we don't</v>

555
00:19:42.841 --> 00:19:46.860
<v Speaker 4>know how to manipulate sociopolitical systems to eliminate or even alleviate</v>

556
00:19:46.861 --> 00:19:47.520
<v Speaker 4>inequality.</v>

557
00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.410
<v Speaker 4>We simply do not know how to do it.</v>

558
00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:53.100
<v Speaker 4>And that's another indication of just exactly how deep the problem is.</v>

559
00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:56.150
<v Speaker 4>Now I'm going to talk about some potential solutions as we progressed.</v>

560
00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:56.941
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

561
00:19:56.941 --> 00:19:57.191
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

562
00:19:57.191 --> 00:20:00.090
<v Speaker 4>we want to grapple with these things like intelligent human beings instead of</v>

563
00:20:00.091 --> 00:20:01.710
<v Speaker 4>like ideological robots,</v>

564
00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:02.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

565
00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.270
<v Speaker 4>and we can,</v>

566
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.841
<v Speaker 4>we can say,</v>

567
00:20:03.841 --> 00:20:04.261
<v Speaker 4>well look,</v>

568
00:20:04.261 --> 00:20:07.290
<v Speaker 4>obviously the fact that some people have have that,</v>

569
00:20:07.291 --> 00:20:11.820
<v Speaker 4>some people stack up at zero and zero's a really hard place to get out of that's</v>

570
00:20:11.821 --> 00:20:14.870
<v Speaker 4>not in anyone's best interest self.</v>

571
00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:16.200
<v Speaker 4>Evidently it's like,</v>

572
00:20:16.201 --> 00:20:16.800
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

573
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:17.760
<v Speaker 4>well what do we do about it?</v>

574
00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:19.110
<v Speaker 4>The answer is we don't know.</v>

575
00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:21.540
<v Speaker 4>Now I think about the,</v>

576
00:20:21.541 --> 00:20:21.750
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

577
00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:24.600
<v Speaker 4>and a lot of the things that we try to do about it make it worse.</v>

578
00:20:24.601 --> 00:20:26.160
<v Speaker 4>So the other thing should I delve pointed out,</v>

579
00:20:26.161 --> 00:20:28.030
<v Speaker 4>and this is one of the horrifying elements of this book,</v>

580
00:20:28.031 --> 00:20:30.420
<v Speaker 4>is there are things we can do to reduce inequality,</v>

581
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:31.800
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

582
00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.450
<v Speaker 4>mass plants,</v>

583
00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:34.740
<v Speaker 4>reducing inequality,</v>

584
00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:36.180
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

585
00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:37.013
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

586
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:38.970
<v Speaker 4>More reduces inequality.</v>

587
00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:39.780
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

588
00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:43.800
<v Speaker 4>Because everyone ends up at zero and that reduces inequality.</v>

589
00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:45.240
<v Speaker 4>And when everyone's dead,</v>

590
00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:46.260
<v Speaker 4>they're all equal.</v>

591
00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:50.110
<v Speaker 4>And those aren't solutions I think that we should necessarily be pursuing.</v>

592
00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:52.000
<v Speaker 4>But as far as Cardale can tell,</v>

593
00:20:52.001 --> 00:20:56.260
<v Speaker 4>there aren't any self-evidently viable alternatives.</v>

594
00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:58.150
<v Speaker 4>And so then we have another problem too,</v>

595
00:20:58.151 --> 00:21:02.320
<v Speaker 4>which is one of the things about capitalism and about the west I would say in</v>

596
00:21:02.321 --> 00:21:02.681
<v Speaker 4>general,</v>

597
00:21:02.681 --> 00:21:05.560
<v Speaker 4>is that while we produce it and quality,</v>

598
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:07.300
<v Speaker 4>because we are producing inequality,</v>

599
00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:08.650
<v Speaker 4>we also produce wealth.</v>

600
00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.330
<v Speaker 4>And that's pretty new,</v>

601
00:21:10.331 --> 00:21:11.164
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

602
00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:12.790
<v Speaker 4>In 1995,</v>

603
00:21:12.791 --> 00:21:16.750
<v Speaker 4>the average western person lived on less than a dollar a day by today's</v>

604
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:17.500
<v Speaker 4>standards,</v>

605
00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:17.790
<v Speaker 4>India,</v>

606
00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:18.623
<v Speaker 4>today's money.</v>

607
00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:20.080
<v Speaker 4>So that's absolute poverty.</v>

608
00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:23.460
<v Speaker 4>So the typical person in 1895 was absolutely poor,</v>

609
00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:26.890
<v Speaker 4>poorer than the typical person who lives on the planet now.</v>

610
00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:28.323
<v Speaker 4>And so this,</v>

611
00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:31.740
<v Speaker 4>this ability to produce wealth into distributed,</v>

612
00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:34.110
<v Speaker 4>which is something we're actually extraordinarily good at,</v>

613
00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:36.580
<v Speaker 4>is really quite new and it's really quite fragile.</v>

614
00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:37.391
<v Speaker 4>What were,</v>

615
00:21:37.391 --> 00:21:38.840
<v Speaker 4>were going great guns out it.</v>

616
00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:43.630
<v Speaker 4>And also I worked for you in committee for about three years or no,</v>

617
00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:46.720
<v Speaker 4>who was a committee for the secretary general that was,</v>

618
00:21:46.721 --> 00:21:47.140
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

619
00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:47.471
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

620
00:21:47.471 --> 00:21:47.770
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

621
00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:51.070
<v Speaker 4>the production of a report on sustainable economic development,</v>

622
00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:51.821
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>

623
00:21:51.821 --> 00:21:52.541
<v Speaker 4>And it started out,</v>

624
00:21:52.541 --> 00:21:53.950
<v Speaker 4>it was really cold war narrative.</v>

625
00:21:53.951 --> 00:21:56.230
<v Speaker 4>It was nasty left versus right narrative,</v>

626
00:21:56.231 --> 00:21:57.940
<v Speaker 4>which I didn't like it all very pessimistic,</v>

627
00:21:57.941 --> 00:21:59.050
<v Speaker 4>very anti human,</v>

628
00:21:59.260 --> 00:21:59.471
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

629
00:21:59.471 --> 00:22:00.820
<v Speaker 4>and we're destroying the planet.</v>

630
00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:04.920
<v Speaker 4>We're horrible people in all that sort of absolute pathological rubbish.</v>

631
00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:06.000
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

632
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:06.880
<v Speaker 1>oh Jesus.</v>

633
00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:13.591
<v Speaker 4>And so we,</v>

634
00:22:13.591 --> 00:22:13.931
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

635
00:22:13.931 --> 00:22:14.360
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

636
00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:18.440
<v Speaker 4>we tried to update the narrative from like 1984 which is where it was basically</v>

637
00:22:18.441 --> 00:22:19.274
<v Speaker 4>stuck,</v>

638
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.640
<v Speaker 4>pointed out that a lot of things are really going well.</v>

639
00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:23.061
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

640
00:22:23.061 --> 00:22:26.960
<v Speaker 4>if we have any sense collectively we'd be celebrating.</v>

641
00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:32.020
<v Speaker 4>Like I follow this group on Twitter called human progress.org which I like quite</v>

642
00:22:32.151 --> 00:22:32.960
<v Speaker 4>a lot.</v>

643
00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:37.220
<v Speaker 4>And they tweet out real positive things.</v>

644
00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:40.700
<v Speaker 4>You don't not feel good stories but like data driven,</v>

645
00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:41.890
<v Speaker 4>optimistic news.</v>

646
00:22:41.891 --> 00:22:46.010
<v Speaker 4>And they had a mock up of the New York Times front page recently that they</v>

647
00:22:46.011 --> 00:22:51.011
<v Speaker 4>tweeted if it said 186,000 people lifted out of absolute poverty today and then</v>

648
00:22:52.581 --> 00:22:55.580
<v Speaker 4>the cut line was we could run that every day for the last 20 years.</v>

649
00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:57.710
<v Speaker 4>It's like you think about that,</v>

650
00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:58.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

651
00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:02.840
<v Speaker 4>so the number of people in absolute poverty in the world fell by 50% between the</v>

652
00:23:02.841 --> 00:23:07.130
<v Speaker 4>year 2000 and the year 2012 which was three years faster than the most</v>

653
00:23:07.131 --> 00:23:09.830
<v Speaker 4>optimistic projections had suggested.</v>

654
00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:10.730
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

655
00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:11.563
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

656
00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:12.723
<v Speaker 1>that's so good.</v>

657
00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:17.170
<v Speaker 1>This isn't the same thing is happening and all sorts of fraud.</v>

658
00:23:17.171 --> 00:23:18.010
<v Speaker 1>So you know the fastest</v>

659
00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:18.791
<v Speaker 4>are we getting caught him.</v>

660
00:23:18.791 --> 00:23:20.920
<v Speaker 4>He sit in the world right now are in sub Sahara Africa.</v>

661
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:21.761
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

662
00:23:21.761 --> 00:23:24.750
<v Speaker 4>and that's partly because the Africans have got a hold of computation</v>

663
00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:25.960
<v Speaker 4>computational technology,</v>

664
00:23:25.961 --> 00:23:26.201
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

665
00:23:26.201 --> 00:23:27.330
<v Speaker 4>Which is a massive deal.</v>

666
00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:28.300
<v Speaker 4>You hold in your hand,</v>

667
00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:32.560
<v Speaker 4>you hold in your hand and computational device that puts the computational</v>

668
00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:36.970
<v Speaker 4>devices that were used to launch the Apollo space program absolutely to shape</v>

669
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:37.480
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

670
00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:40.300
<v Speaker 4>And everyone has one and those who don't will have one suit.</v>

671
00:23:40.301 --> 00:23:40.811
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

672
00:23:40.811 --> 00:23:45.410
<v Speaker 4>that's one of the things that starts to make you rich and about 300,000 people,</v>

673
00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.480
<v Speaker 4>hundreds of thousands of people a week or being hooked up to the power grid.</v>

674
00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:54.110
<v Speaker 4>We're kicking the hell up chop mortality and also all cause mortality.</v>

675
00:23:54.111 --> 00:23:58.580
<v Speaker 4>And extending life radically and people are literate way more literate than they</v>

676
00:23:58.581 --> 00:24:00.290
<v Speaker 4>were 50 years ago across the world.</v>

677
00:24:00.291 --> 00:24:04.280
<v Speaker 4>It's like a lot of really amazing things are happening harming what's happened,</v>

678
00:24:04.281 --> 00:24:04.731
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

679
00:24:04.731 --> 00:24:07.940
<v Speaker 4>and this is made things more difficult in the United States in particular,</v>

680
00:24:07.941 --> 00:24:12.530
<v Speaker 4>is that a lot of the advances made by the working class in places,</v>

681
00:24:12.531 --> 00:24:13.280
<v Speaker 4>say like Gideon,</v>

682
00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:14.060
<v Speaker 4>China,</v>

683
00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:14.421
<v Speaker 4>happy,</v>

684
00:24:14.421 --> 00:24:18.050
<v Speaker 4>purchased out the expensive and increasing standard of living for American</v>

685
00:24:18.051 --> 00:24:18.800
<v Speaker 4>working people.</v>

686
00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:20.420
<v Speaker 4>And so they're the ones who pretty paid for this.</v>

687
00:24:20.421 --> 00:24:20.950
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

688
00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:21.650
<v Speaker 4>and that's,</v>

689
00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:23.660
<v Speaker 4>that's sad and it's hard,</v>

690
00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:26.310
<v Speaker 4>but it's not so bad that the Chinese aren't starving.</v>

691
00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:26.780
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

692
00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:28.700
<v Speaker 4>it's not so bad that the Indians aren't starving.</v>

693
00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:29.481
<v Speaker 4>There's lots of them.</v>

694
00:24:29.481 --> 00:24:33.950
<v Speaker 4>And if they were in the economy and producing and moving themselves up to middle</v>

695
00:24:33.951 --> 00:24:34.371
<v Speaker 4>class,</v>

696
00:24:34.371 --> 00:24:36.110
<v Speaker 4>it's like that's a pretty damn good deal.</v>

697
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:38.570
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things that really shocked me,</v>

698
00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:39.570
<v Speaker 4>what particularly when,</v>

699
00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:42.620
<v Speaker 4>when I was helping write this report was like,</v>

700
00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:43.251
<v Speaker 4>what the hell?</v>

701
00:24:43.251 --> 00:24:44.450
<v Speaker 4>Why don't we know this?</v>

702
00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:48.170
<v Speaker 4>Why don't we like having a little party or even a big party about it?</v>

703
00:24:48.171 --> 00:24:50.480
<v Speaker 4>Instead of biting off her own legs,</v>

704
00:24:50.481 --> 00:24:52.220
<v Speaker 4>which we see to be doing it the west spring.</v>

705
00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:55.160
<v Speaker 4>Now with all this idiotic political polarization,</v>

706
00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:57.830
<v Speaker 4>like things are not so bad.</v>

707
00:24:57.890 --> 00:24:58.131
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

708
00:24:58.131 --> 00:24:59.810
<v Speaker 4>there was still a bloody catastrophe,</v>

709
00:24:59.811 --> 00:25:00.081
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

710
00:25:00.081 --> 00:25:01.760
<v Speaker 4>Because life is a catastrophe.</v>

711
00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:04.160
<v Speaker 4>But comparatively speaking,</v>

712
00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:05.323
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

713
00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:06.410
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

714
00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:08.120
<v Speaker 4>so that's what's doing that.</v>

715
00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:08.391
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

716
00:25:08.391 --> 00:25:10.050
<v Speaker 4>I can tell you it's not communism.</v>

717
00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:10.940
<v Speaker 4>It's doing that.</v>

718
00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:12.590
<v Speaker 4>That's for blade shirt.</v>

719
00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:14.480
<v Speaker 4>What's happening is the free market,</v>

720
00:25:14.481 --> 00:25:17.450
<v Speaker 4>essentially the free market is making people rich.</v>

721
00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:19.640
<v Speaker 4>It's increasing inequality at the same time,</v>

722
00:25:19.641 --> 00:25:20.181
<v Speaker 4>but at least,</v>

723
00:25:20.181 --> 00:25:20.381
<v Speaker 4>whoa,</v>

724
00:25:20.381 --> 00:25:21.860
<v Speaker 4>it's increasing inequality.</v>

725
00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:24.020
<v Speaker 4>It's stopping people from starving to death.</v>

726
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:24.441
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

727
00:25:24.441 --> 00:25:25.274
<v Speaker 4>that's something.</v>

728
00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:30.573
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

729
00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:33.840
<v Speaker 4>so that's chapter one.</v>

730
00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:33.991
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

731
00:25:33.991 --> 00:25:36.870
<v Speaker 4>there's a bit of an injunction in chapter one and rule one there.</v>

732
00:25:36.871 --> 00:25:37.704
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

733
00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:38.371
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

734
00:25:38.371 --> 00:25:39.204
<v Speaker 4>so</v>

735
00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:44.340
<v Speaker 4>you have to battle with a number of things in your life and you have to battle</v>

736
00:25:44.341 --> 00:25:45.270
<v Speaker 4>with the tragedy.</v>

737
00:25:45.271 --> 00:25:46.110
<v Speaker 4>That's your life.</v>

738
00:25:46.111 --> 00:25:49.050
<v Speaker 4>You know when you have to battle with the fact that you're not everything you</v>

739
00:25:49.051 --> 00:25:50.970
<v Speaker 4>could be and probably never will be.</v>

740
00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:51.541
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

741
00:25:51.541 --> 00:25:55.020
<v Speaker 4>you have to battle with the fact that you've got an evil heart just like the</v>

742
00:25:55.021 --> 00:25:55.831
<v Speaker 4>person next to you.</v>

743
00:25:55.831 --> 00:25:59.460
<v Speaker 4>It's like there's all sorts of things if you have to contend with in life that</v>

744
00:25:59.461 --> 00:25:59.791
<v Speaker 4>are very,</v>

745
00:25:59.791 --> 00:26:00.600
<v Speaker 4>very difficult.</v>

746
00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.630
<v Speaker 4>The fact of hierarchy and the fact that they would call and he'd hold up that as</v>

747
00:26:03.631 --> 00:26:04.410
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>

748
00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:06.870
<v Speaker 4>That's part of your intrinsic vulnerability.</v>

749
00:26:06.871 --> 00:26:11.430
<v Speaker 4>Let's say it's the price you pay for BIA as far as I can tell,</v>

750
00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:12.810
<v Speaker 4>but we'll talk about that later.</v>

751
00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:13.771
<v Speaker 4>The question is,</v>

752
00:26:13.771 --> 00:26:13.921
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

753
00:26:13.921 --> 00:26:15.990
<v Speaker 4>how do you deal with that unfairness?</v>

754
00:26:15.991 --> 00:26:17.900
<v Speaker 4>Let's say that the intrinsic unfairness,</v>

755
00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:18.450
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

756
00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:19.680
<v Speaker 4>people are quite creative.</v>

757
00:26:19.681 --> 00:26:23.930
<v Speaker 4>I mean some of the things we do to combat that's essential inequalities.</v>

758
00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:25.770
<v Speaker 4>We generate a lot of different games.</v>

759
00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:26.341
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

760
00:26:26.341 --> 00:26:29.610
<v Speaker 4>like animals basically played one game and you're either good at it or you're</v>

761
00:26:29.611 --> 00:26:29.911
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>

762
00:26:29.911 --> 00:26:30.661
<v Speaker 4>but human beings,</v>

763
00:26:30.661 --> 00:26:32.850
<v Speaker 4>we played hundreds of games and if you're not good at one,</v>

764
00:26:32.851 --> 00:26:36.360
<v Speaker 4>you can maybe find another one that you're at least not so bad at.</v>

765
00:26:36.361 --> 00:26:40.050
<v Speaker 4>Or at least improving out or maybe you can invent your own game.</v>

766
00:26:40.051 --> 00:26:43.140
<v Speaker 4>And so that's a pretty creative thing to do and we're pretty damn good at that.</v>

767
00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:45.120
<v Speaker 4>And so that's one solution.</v>

768
00:26:45.121 --> 00:26:46.910
<v Speaker 4>But another solution to is this too.</v>

769
00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:51.260
<v Speaker 4>The question is if,</v>

770
00:26:51.261 --> 00:26:54.060
<v Speaker 4>if the environment arrays itself into a hierarchy,</v>

771
00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:59.160
<v Speaker 4>how is it that you're best situated to play within that hierarchy?</v>

772
00:26:59.550 --> 00:26:59.781
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

773
00:26:59.781 --> 00:27:02.280
<v Speaker 4>in one answer might be to make yourself powerful,</v>

774
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:02.551
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

775
00:27:02.551 --> 00:27:03.900
<v Speaker 4>in the physical sense or in the,</v>

776
00:27:03.901 --> 00:27:07.590
<v Speaker 4>in the menacing and threatening sense because especially the people who</v>

777
00:27:07.591 --> 00:27:12.120
<v Speaker 4>criticize hierarchy always presume that what makes you dominant in the hierarchy</v>

778
00:27:12.121 --> 00:27:13.500
<v Speaker 4>is something like raw power,</v>

779
00:27:13.501 --> 00:27:15.060
<v Speaker 4>which by the way is just not true.</v>

780
00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:17.880
<v Speaker 4>It's true to a limited sense among some animals.</v>

781
00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:19.470
<v Speaker 4>It's really not true when human beings,</v>

782
00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:23.250
<v Speaker 4>it's not even true among complex primates because what's been found about</v>

783
00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:24.540
<v Speaker 4>chimpanzees for example,</v>

784
00:27:24.541 --> 00:27:29.130
<v Speaker 4>is that the brutal tyrant chimps tend to be ripped to shreds by there,</v>

785
00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:29.790
<v Speaker 4>by the,</v>

786
00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:33.180
<v Speaker 4>by the chimpanzees that there tyrannizing as soon as they have a weak moment.</v>

787
00:27:33.181 --> 00:27:36.240
<v Speaker 4>And you don't have to have much of an imagination to see how that plays out.</v>

788
00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.110
<v Speaker 4>On the human stage.</v>

789
00:27:37.111 --> 00:27:40.830
<v Speaker 4>And so it actually turns out that if you want to climb a hierarchy,</v>

790
00:27:40.831 --> 00:27:44.100
<v Speaker 4>let's say that the hierarchy isn't the power hierarchy,</v>

791
00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.690
<v Speaker 4>not not in a functioning society,</v>

792
00:27:45.691 --> 00:27:49.620
<v Speaker 4>it's more like a competence hierarchy or more like a voluntary game.</v>

793
00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:53.520
<v Speaker 4>And the way that you climb it actually believe it or not is by being a good</v>

794
00:27:53.521 --> 00:27:54.354
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>

795
00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:55.111
<v Speaker 4>And you might think,</v>

796
00:27:55.111 --> 00:27:56.820
<v Speaker 4>well that's a little naive.</v>

797
00:27:56.821 --> 00:27:57.630
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

798
00:27:57.630 --> 00:27:58.463
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

799
00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:00.220
<v Speaker 4>no it's not really that night.</v>

800
00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:01.081
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

801
00:28:01.081 --> 00:28:03.060
<v Speaker 4>it's not that easy to be a good person.</v>

802
00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:04.540
<v Speaker 4>And the second is it's,</v>

803
00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:06.010
<v Speaker 4>it's somewhat self evident.</v>

804
00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:06.721
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

805
00:28:06.721 --> 00:28:10.200
<v Speaker 4>like you know people that you trust and you don't trust.</v>

806
00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.330
<v Speaker 4>And like once you don't trust someone,</v>

807
00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:13.950
<v Speaker 4>you really don't trust them.</v>

808
00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:16.410
<v Speaker 4>It's really hard for them to recover from that.</v>

809
00:28:16.411 --> 00:28:17.400
<v Speaker 4>And if you don't trust them,</v>

810
00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:19.260
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to play with them.</v>

811
00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:19.890
<v Speaker 4>None.</v>

812
00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:21.000
<v Speaker 4>If you have any sense.</v>

813
00:28:21.001 --> 00:28:24.900
<v Speaker 4>And we're really good at relationship tracking and we're especially good at</v>

814
00:28:24.901 --> 00:28:28.710
<v Speaker 4>tracking behavior that's ethically suspect.</v>

815
00:28:28.711 --> 00:28:32.490
<v Speaker 4>And we remember it like one mistake of blowing your reputation,</v>

816
00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:32.701
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

817
00:28:32.701 --> 00:28:33.534
<v Speaker 4>it's harsh,</v>

818
00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:35.930
<v Speaker 4>but it just shows you how important trust is.</v>

819
00:28:35.931 --> 00:28:38.880
<v Speaker 4>And if you act in a trustworthy manner,</v>

820
00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:41.550
<v Speaker 4>and I'm not saying this is enough to make your life,</v>

821
00:28:41.551 --> 00:28:42.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

822
00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:43.490
<v Speaker 4>all sparkles and,</v>

823
00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:43.801
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

824
00:28:43.801 --> 00:28:44.310
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

825
00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:45.240
<v Speaker 4>and rainbows.</v>

826
00:28:45.241 --> 00:28:47.820
<v Speaker 4>It's like forget that that ain't happening no matter what you do.</v>

827
00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:49.260
<v Speaker 4>But if you're,</v>

828
00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:51.330
<v Speaker 4>if you're someone that can be trusted,</v>

829
00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:57.200
<v Speaker 4>then the probability that you'll at least move towards some degree of success in</v>

830
00:28:57.211 --> 00:28:59.730
<v Speaker 4>your domain is radically increased.</v>

831
00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:01.500
<v Speaker 4>And so that's a good deal.</v>

832
00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:06.090
<v Speaker 4>And then the other thing too is that makes you a contender in a,</v>

833
00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:09.600
<v Speaker 4>in a hierarchical game is a kind of courage.</v>

834
00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.630
<v Speaker 4>And it's a funny courage cause it's,</v>

835
00:29:11.631 --> 00:29:12.900
<v Speaker 4>it's paradoxical curves.</v>

836
00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:16.590
<v Speaker 4>This is one of the things I really liked about the narrative structure of</v>

837
00:29:16.591 --> 00:29:17.341
<v Speaker 4>Christianity,</v>

838
00:29:17.341 --> 00:29:17.761
<v Speaker 4>I would say,</v>

839
00:29:17.761 --> 00:29:20.960
<v Speaker 4>because I think Christianity has done a very good job of detailing out this idea</v>

840
00:29:20.961 --> 00:29:21.794
<v Speaker 4>is that if you,</v>

841
00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:26.130
<v Speaker 4>the competence that you need to manifest in life,</v>

842
00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:29.460
<v Speaker 4>the courage that you need to manifest in life.</v>

843
00:29:29.461 --> 00:29:32.040
<v Speaker 4>And that goes along with being someone that can be trusted,</v>

844
00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:36.660
<v Speaker 4>is to be someone who will stand up and expose themselves.</v>

845
00:29:36.661 --> 00:29:37.494
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

846
00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:41.040
<v Speaker 4>let's try a different term</v>

847
00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:46.450
<v Speaker 4>who will accept their vulnerability,</v>

848
00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:46.911
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

849
00:29:46.911 --> 00:29:49.780
<v Speaker 4>And take that on as part and parcel of their responsibility.</v>

850
00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:52.630
<v Speaker 4>And part of that for human beings is to stand up,</v>

851
00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:53.320
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

852
00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:56.950
<v Speaker 4>because the most vulnerable part of us is faced forward.</v>

853
00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:58.600
<v Speaker 4>We're unlike our other creatures,</v>

854
00:29:58.601 --> 00:29:58.811
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

855
00:29:58.811 --> 00:30:03.190
<v Speaker 4>Because other animals they pour on on all four and their back is armored and</v>

856
00:30:03.191 --> 00:30:05.170
<v Speaker 4>that's what they present to the world essentially.</v>

857
00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:05.711
<v Speaker 4>But not us.</v>

858
00:30:05.711 --> 00:30:09.640
<v Speaker 4>We stepped up and make the most vulnerable parts of us front and forward.</v>

859
00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:11.610
<v Speaker 4>And there's a kind of courage in that.</v>

860
00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:16.620
<v Speaker 4>But because I'm willing to take on the catastrophe of existence forthrightly,</v>

861
00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:18.340
<v Speaker 4>and that's what rule one is,</v>

862
00:30:18.341 --> 00:30:18.640
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

863
00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:19.473
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

864
00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:20.320
<v Speaker 4>it's not,</v>

865
00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:21.100
<v Speaker 4>it's not,</v>

866
00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:23.980
<v Speaker 4>it's not a finger wagging injunction for stand up straight.</v>

867
00:30:23.981 --> 00:30:24.251
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

868
00:30:24.251 --> 00:30:26.050
<v Speaker 4>because there's something wrong with you if you don't.</v>

869
00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:27.123
<v Speaker 4>Although there is,</v>

870
00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:31.060
<v Speaker 4>it's an encouragement to say,</v>

871
00:30:31.061 --> 00:30:31.600
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

872
00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:36.040
<v Speaker 4>the way that you find out how strong you can be is to accept how vulnerable you</v>

873
00:30:36.041 --> 00:30:36.874
<v Speaker 4>are.</v>

874
00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:38.230
<v Speaker 4>And if you think about it,</v>

875
00:30:38.231 --> 00:30:41.020
<v Speaker 4>that makes perfect sense because we are self aware creatures.</v>

876
00:30:41.021 --> 00:30:44.320
<v Speaker 4>We know perfectly well how badly we can be hurt when we also know that we will</v>

877
00:30:44.321 --> 00:30:44.701
<v Speaker 4>be broken.</v>

878
00:30:44.701 --> 00:30:46.590
<v Speaker 4>It's not just that we could be bird.</v>

879
00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:47.920
<v Speaker 4>It's way worse than not.</v>

880
00:30:47.921 --> 00:30:51.700
<v Speaker 4>It's that we most certainly will be hurt in terrible ways.</v>

881
00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:54.820
<v Speaker 4>And to be able to stand up and take that,</v>

882
00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:55.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

883
00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:58.150
<v Speaker 4>and to take that like someone who's courageous,</v>

884
00:30:58.151 --> 00:30:58.750
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

885
00:30:58.750 --> 00:30:59.583
<v Speaker 4>well that'll,</v>

886
00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:01.300
<v Speaker 4>that'll float your boat man.</v>

887
00:31:01.450 --> 00:31:03.190
<v Speaker 4>That'll make people respect you.</v>

888
00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:07.000
<v Speaker 4>That'll increase the probability that they'll trust you and it will allow you to</v>

889
00:31:07.001 --> 00:31:10.210
<v Speaker 4>sleep with a good conscience at ninth and that's something,</v>

890
00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:12.910
<v Speaker 4>and maybe that's about as good as it gets.</v>

891
00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:14.410
<v Speaker 4>And so that's rule one.</v>

892
00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:19.450
<v Speaker 4>Rule two is an extension of that.</v>

893
00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:19.860
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

894
00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:20.010
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

895
00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:20.381
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

896
00:31:20.381 --> 00:31:25.381
<v Speaker 4>it's treat yourself as if you have someone responsible for helping and</v>

897
00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:30.880
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

898
00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:34.150
<v Speaker 4>you hear it from psychologists frequently that,</v>

899
00:31:34.151 --> 00:31:34.361
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

900
00:31:34.361 --> 00:31:37.960
<v Speaker 4>people are kind of narcissistic and they tend to overestimate their skills in</v>

901
00:31:37.961 --> 00:31:40.300
<v Speaker 4>relationship to other people and so forth.</v>

902
00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:41.850
<v Speaker 4>I don't really buy any of that.</v>

903
00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:41.961
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

904
00:31:41.961 --> 00:31:42.400
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

905
00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:43.270
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's true.</v>

906
00:31:43.271 --> 00:31:44.890
<v Speaker 4>I think most of that's a measurement garden.</v>

907
00:31:44.891 --> 00:31:45.724
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

908
00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:48.490
<v Speaker 4>I think instead that people,</v>

909
00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:53.880
<v Speaker 4>my sense of people from my clinical perspective and from my research perspective</v>

910
00:31:54.221 --> 00:31:55.920
<v Speaker 4>is actually Jeff or the opposite of that.</v>

911
00:31:55.921 --> 00:31:56.650
<v Speaker 4>If you,</v>

912
00:31:56.650 --> 00:31:59.320
<v Speaker 4>if you sit down and you have a serious conversation with someone,</v>

913
00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:02.710
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't take very long if you have a serious conversation,</v>

914
00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:04.790
<v Speaker 4>unless they're narcissistic and in,</v>

915
00:32:04.791 --> 00:32:06.480
<v Speaker 4>in really pathological manner.</v>

916
00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:08.260
<v Speaker 4>Most people aren't like that.</v>

917
00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:12.280
<v Speaker 4>They're so damn painfully aware of what's wrong with them that it's hard to</v>

918
00:32:12.281 --> 00:32:13.114
<v Speaker 4>even,</v>

919
00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:15.490
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to even face,</v>

920
00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:16.151
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

921
00:32:16.151 --> 00:32:21.151
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to talk to someone for very long until they tell you what they've</v>

922
00:32:22.871 --> 00:32:25.450
<v Speaker 4>done wrong or how they're inadequate.</v>

923
00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:27.610
<v Speaker 4>It's not some whiny game,</v>

924
00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:29.560
<v Speaker 4>although sometimes it's that it's,</v>

925
00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:34.670
<v Speaker 4>it's genuine recognition of their shortcomings and false.</v>

926
00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:36.323
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

927
00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:42.020
<v Speaker 4>The with being an individual person is that,</v>

928
00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:43.021
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

929
00:32:43.021 --> 00:32:47.380
<v Speaker 4>you kind of are aware of the fragility of human beings in general and then not</v>

930
00:32:47.381 --> 00:32:48.650
<v Speaker 4>only that for fragility,</v>

931
00:32:48.651 --> 00:32:52.340
<v Speaker 4>but also is there tendency towards malevolence because it isn't the only that</v>

932
00:32:52.341 --> 00:32:53.174
<v Speaker 4>we're vulnerable.</v>

933
00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:56.120
<v Speaker 4>We're vulnerable and we're capable of doing terrible things,</v>

934
00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:58.460
<v Speaker 4>not to ourselves but also to other people.</v>

935
00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:00.950
<v Speaker 4>And not only are we capable of doing that,</v>

936
00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:02.990
<v Speaker 4>we've all done it and we know it.</v>

937
00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:05.690
<v Speaker 4>And so you've got that to carry around,</v>

938
00:33:05.691 --> 00:33:05.931
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

939
00:33:05.931 --> 00:33:07.670
<v Speaker 4>the fact that you aren't everything you could be.</v>

940
00:33:07.671 --> 00:33:08.570
<v Speaker 4>And that's for sure.</v>

941
00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:13.720
<v Speaker 4>And the fact that you know you've done some things that really aren't that pride</v>

942
00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:15.190
<v Speaker 4>worthy,</v>

943
00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:15.920
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

944
00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:17.450
<v Speaker 4>and you bloody well know it.</v>

945
00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:18.830
<v Speaker 4>Even if you're trying to fight it,</v>

946
00:33:18.831 --> 00:33:19.880
<v Speaker 4>if you're trying to avoid it,</v>

947
00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:23.930
<v Speaker 4>you might even be more painfully aware of it then you should be.</v>

948
00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:24.231
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

949
00:33:24.231 --> 00:33:27.560
<v Speaker 4>because sometimes I've also seen it with people is they're much more willing to</v>

950
00:33:27.561 --> 00:33:30.050
<v Speaker 4>forgive other people than they are willing to forgive themselves.</v>

951
00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:33.040
<v Speaker 4>So I'm telling you think,</v>

952
00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:34.940
<v Speaker 4>well so this chapter's well.</v>

953
00:33:34.941 --> 00:33:37.490
<v Speaker 4>Treat yourself like you're someone responsible for helping you think.</v>

954
00:33:37.491 --> 00:33:38.500
<v Speaker 4>Well that's self evidence.</v>

955
00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:39.920
<v Speaker 4>Like it's not so self evident.</v>

956
00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:43.790
<v Speaker 4>I open the chapter with this observation that if you have a pet,</v>

957
00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:47.090
<v Speaker 4>if you go to a doctor and you get a prescription medication,</v>

958
00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:49.550
<v Speaker 4>well there's one third chance that you won't fill it.</v>

959
00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:50.391
<v Speaker 4>And if you do fill it,</v>

960
00:33:50.391 --> 00:33:52.850
<v Speaker 4>there's a 50% chance you won't take the medication.</v>

961
00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:54.201
<v Speaker 4>And so you think,</v>

962
00:33:54.201 --> 00:33:54.411
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

963
00:33:54.411 --> 00:33:55.850
<v Speaker 4>maybe there's a bunch of reasons for that.</v>

964
00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:56.960
<v Speaker 4>You don't trust the doctor,</v>

965
00:33:56.961 --> 00:33:57.621
<v Speaker 4>you're lazy,</v>

966
00:33:57.621 --> 00:33:59.060
<v Speaker 4>you don't understand what's going on,</v>

967
00:33:59.061 --> 00:33:59.541
<v Speaker 4>who knows?</v>

968
00:33:59.541 --> 00:34:00.980
<v Speaker 4>But here's the weird thing.</v>

969
00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:01.851
<v Speaker 4>That's not true.</v>

970
00:34:01.851 --> 00:34:05.990
<v Speaker 4>If you take your pet to the that if you take your pat to the Vat,</v>

971
00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:10.250
<v Speaker 4>well then you'll go fill the prescription and you'll give the damn pet the</v>

972
00:34:10.251 --> 00:34:11.010
<v Speaker 4>medication.</v>

973
00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:11.391
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

974
00:34:11.391 --> 00:34:12.020
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

975
00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:13.190
<v Speaker 4>what's going on there?</v>

976
00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:15.620
<v Speaker 4>Do you like your dog more than you like you?</v>

977
00:34:15.650 --> 00:34:15.951
<v Speaker 4>So like,</v>

978
00:34:15.951 --> 00:34:16.784
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

979
00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:18.560
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

980
00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:19.880
<v Speaker 4>maybe even a lot,</v>

981
00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:22.280
<v Speaker 4>you know love.</v>

982
00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:23.990
<v Speaker 4>And there's some reason for that because you know,</v>

983
00:34:23.991 --> 00:34:25.640
<v Speaker 4>if you have a dog or a cat,</v>

984
00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:27.050
<v Speaker 4>let's say a dog in this case,</v>

985
00:34:27.051 --> 00:34:27.980
<v Speaker 4>like the dog,</v>

986
00:34:27.981 --> 00:34:29.120
<v Speaker 4>is it innocent creature?</v>

987
00:34:29.121 --> 00:34:29.811
<v Speaker 4>It's a carnivore,</v>

988
00:34:29.811 --> 00:34:30.980
<v Speaker 4>but it's an innocent creature.</v>

989
00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:33.020
<v Speaker 4>I get t doesn't have sins zone.</v>

990
00:34:33.021 --> 00:34:33.950
<v Speaker 4>It's conscience.</v>

991
00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:36.560
<v Speaker 4>You don't expect the dog to be everything.</v>

992
00:34:36.561 --> 00:34:37.580
<v Speaker 4>It could be.</v>

993
00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:38.360
<v Speaker 4>I said dog,</v>

994
00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:39.350
<v Speaker 4>if that's where this this,</v>

995
00:34:39.351 --> 00:34:40.220
<v Speaker 4>you do it right.</v>

996
00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:41.121
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

997
00:34:41.121 --> 00:34:44.480
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty happy when it sees you and it's a pretty fair exchange of our</v>

998
00:34:44.481 --> 00:34:45.200
<v Speaker 4>factors.</v>

999
00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:47.090
<v Speaker 4>There's no reason to distrust the dog.</v>

1000
00:34:47.091 --> 00:34:51.620
<v Speaker 4>I mean it might do foolish dog things like chew a toy when it's not supposed to,</v>

1001
00:34:51.621 --> 00:34:54.410
<v Speaker 4>but that's about as far as sin goes for a dog.</v>

1002
00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:57.310
<v Speaker 4>And so they're easy to like and you're,</v>

1003
00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:58.220
<v Speaker 4>you're not so easy.</v>

1004
00:34:58.221 --> 00:34:59.420
<v Speaker 4>Like that's for sure.</v>

1005
00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:02.223
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1006
00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:03.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1007
00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:03.861
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

1008
00:35:03.861 --> 00:35:05.600
<v Speaker 4>you can tell that cause your family members,</v>

1009
00:35:05.601 --> 00:35:07.530
<v Speaker 4>they're happier to see if the dog that they aren't seeing.</v>

1010
00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:12.981
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1011
00:35:12.981 --> 00:35:13.221
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1012
00:35:13.221 --> 00:35:13.701
<v Speaker 4>you got it,</v>

1013
00:35:13.701 --> 00:35:14.271
<v Speaker 4>you've got this,</v>

1014
00:35:14.271 --> 00:35:15.620
<v Speaker 4>you've got this tough problem,</v>

1015
00:35:15.621 --> 00:35:17.840
<v Speaker 4>which is what you got to put up with yourself.</v>

1016
00:35:17.841 --> 00:35:20.420
<v Speaker 4>And it's even worse than that because you know who you are.</v>

1017
00:35:20.421 --> 00:35:20.781
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1018
00:35:20.781 --> 00:35:21.614
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

1019
00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:23.210
<v Speaker 4>who's gonna take care of that?</v>

1020
00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:24.210
<v Speaker 4>No one.</v>

1021
00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:24.860
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1022
00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:27.590
<v Speaker 4>well just let it walk her off into a corner somewhere.</v>

1023
00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:28.483
<v Speaker 4>Die.</v>

1024
00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:30.201
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

1025
00:35:30.201 --> 00:35:31.550
<v Speaker 4>it's not a good thing.</v>

1026
00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:33.540
<v Speaker 4>One of the things I learned from Carl Young,</v>

1027
00:35:33.541 --> 00:35:33.970
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

1028
00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:36.140
<v Speaker 4>he talked about this is Christian junction.</v>

1029
00:35:36.141 --> 00:35:37.950
<v Speaker 4>It's from a psychological perspective,</v>

1030
00:35:37.951 --> 00:35:39.630
<v Speaker 4>which is to treat,</v>

1031
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:43.050
<v Speaker 4>treat other people like you would like to be treated.</v>

1032
00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:43.470
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1033
00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:43.950
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

1034
00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:47.700
<v Speaker 4>people often think of that as this injunction to be nice to other people.</v>

1035
00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:49.620
<v Speaker 4>It's like that is not what that means.</v>

1036
00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:50.250
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

1037
00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:52.500
<v Speaker 4>nice has a very low and virtue man.</v>

1038
00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:54.720
<v Speaker 4>Nice as heartless as far as I'm concerned.</v>

1039
00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:55.230
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

1040
00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:56.310
<v Speaker 4>that's not a virtue.</v>

1041
00:35:56.311 --> 00:35:59.950
<v Speaker 4>It's the absence of a particular fault at best</v>

1042
00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:04.680
<v Speaker 4>to treat yourself,</v>

1043
00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:08.870
<v Speaker 4>to treat yourself like you.</v>

1044
00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:12.540
<v Speaker 4>Treat others like you'd like to be treated yourself is an equation.</v>

1045
00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:16.740
<v Speaker 4>So let's say I've enjoyed in some sense to treat you properly,</v>

1046
00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:17.603
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1047
00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:20.860
<v Speaker 4>but I'm also joined to treat myself properly and so then I'd have to think that</v>

1048
00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:21.301
<v Speaker 4>through.</v>

1049
00:36:21.301 --> 00:36:22.090
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1050
00:36:22.090 --> 00:36:23.550
<v Speaker 4>let's say you have a child,</v>

1051
00:36:23.551 --> 00:36:25.350
<v Speaker 4>you have a son and you want to treat a properly.</v>

1052
00:36:25.351 --> 00:36:25.651
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1053
00:36:25.651 --> 00:36:27.350
<v Speaker 4>well you don't just let them get away with everything.</v>

1054
00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:28.410
<v Speaker 4>That's not helpful.</v>

1055
00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:32.970
<v Speaker 4>You want to sit and think about what sort of person you would like this child to</v>

1056
00:36:32.971 --> 00:36:33.390
<v Speaker 4>be calm.</v>

1057
00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:34.590
<v Speaker 4>You want to encourage that,</v>

1058
00:36:34.591 --> 00:36:35.070
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1059
00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:40.070
<v Speaker 4>You want to act as if you're charged with the care of something valuable and</v>

1060
00:36:40.501 --> 00:36:43.110
<v Speaker 4>precious and then you do what you can.</v>

1061
00:36:43.111 --> 00:36:47.310
<v Speaker 4>If you have any sense to help that person become everything they can become,</v>

1062
00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:47.761
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1063
00:36:47.761 --> 00:36:50.310
<v Speaker 4>well you have the same responsibility to yourself.</v>

1064
00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:51.301
<v Speaker 4>Even as you know,</v>

1065
00:36:51.301 --> 00:36:54.150
<v Speaker 4>even even though you might not think you deserve it,</v>

1066
00:36:54.151 --> 00:36:56.040
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't have anything to do with deserving it.</v>

1067
00:36:56.041 --> 00:36:56.970
<v Speaker 4>It's some sense,</v>

1068
00:36:57.090 --> 00:37:02.090
<v Speaker 4>it's a moral requirement to view yourself despite your inadequacies and your</v>

1069
00:37:03.931 --> 00:37:08.931
<v Speaker 4>faults as if you're someone who needs to be properly taken care of and,</v>

1070
00:37:09.250 --> 00:37:09.870
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1071
00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:12.870
<v Speaker 4>and it's a responsibility on your part to figure out what that is.</v>

1072
00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:14.070
<v Speaker 4>And this actually works.</v>

1073
00:37:14.071 --> 00:37:14.904
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1074
00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:19.500
<v Speaker 4>we have this program we designed called self authoring and I designed it with</v>

1075
00:37:19.501 --> 00:37:20.390
<v Speaker 4>two of my colleagues,</v>

1076
00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:22.050
<v Speaker 4>Daniel Higgins and Robert Peel.</v>

1077
00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:23.910
<v Speaker 4>One was a graduate student of mine,</v>

1078
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:27.930
<v Speaker 4>that's Daniel Higgins and the other was my graduate supervisor at McGill.</v>

1079
00:37:27.931 --> 00:37:32.931
<v Speaker 4>And we worked on that for about 20 years figuring out how to make it accessible</v>

1080
00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:34.390
<v Speaker 4>to individuals on the web.</v>

1081
00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:37.980
<v Speaker 4>We want it to bring psychological interventions to people that were low cost and</v>

1082
00:37:37.981 --> 00:37:38.411
<v Speaker 4>effective.</v>

1083
00:37:38.411 --> 00:37:39.420
<v Speaker 4>And we have this,</v>

1084
00:37:39.421 --> 00:37:41.780
<v Speaker 4>part of this program is the future authoring program.</v>

1085
00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:44.010
<v Speaker 4>And it's two parts.</v>

1086
00:37:44.011 --> 00:37:45.660
<v Speaker 4>It's a writing program because writing,</v>

1087
00:37:45.661 --> 00:37:46.081
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

1088
00:37:46.081 --> 00:37:47.430
<v Speaker 4>if you want to straighten out your brain,</v>

1089
00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:50.100
<v Speaker 4>there's almost nothing you can do that's better than writing.</v>

1090
00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:52.020
<v Speaker 4>Writing really straightens you out.</v>

1091
00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:57.750
<v Speaker 4>You're organized at the highest level of your personality,</v>

1092
00:37:57.751 --> 00:37:58.890
<v Speaker 4>your organized verbally.</v>

1093
00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:00.143
<v Speaker 4>And so you have to,</v>

1094
00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:02.460
<v Speaker 4>you have to have an account of yourself.</v>

1095
00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:05.280
<v Speaker 4>You have to have an articulated the counting yourself of yourself.</v>

1096
00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:08.280
<v Speaker 4>That's why you talk to people all the time about what's going on in your life.</v>

1097
00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:11.260
<v Speaker 4>It's so that you can have an articulated account of yourself.</v>

1098
00:38:11.261 --> 00:38:15.570
<v Speaker 4>And if you're disorganized at the level of the articulated account that you're</v>

1099
00:38:15.571 --> 00:38:16.380
<v Speaker 4>disorganized,</v>

1100
00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:16.921
<v Speaker 4>you might think,</v>

1101
00:38:16.921 --> 00:38:17.101
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1102
00:38:17.101 --> 00:38:17.641
<v Speaker 4>who cares?</v>

1103
00:38:17.641 --> 00:38:18.150
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1104
00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:18.391
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1105
00:38:18.391 --> 00:38:18.541
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1106
00:38:18.541 --> 00:38:18.840
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1107
00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:19.920
<v Speaker 4>You don't understand.</v>

1108
00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:21.210
<v Speaker 4>If you're disorganized,</v>

1109
00:38:21.211 --> 00:38:22.620
<v Speaker 4>you fall into a pit.</v>

1110
00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:24.210
<v Speaker 4>Like it's a bad thing.</v>

1111
00:38:24.211 --> 00:38:25.290
<v Speaker 4>It's like you have a map,</v>

1112
00:38:25.291 --> 00:38:27.000
<v Speaker 4>but there's stains everywhere.</v>

1113
00:38:27.001 --> 00:38:31.650
<v Speaker 4>There's big holes torn in it and it's half drawn in Crayon and like you're not</v>

1114
00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:34.230
<v Speaker 4>getting anywhere good with a map like that.</v>

1115
00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:36.760
<v Speaker 4>And so you have to be able to articulate yourself.</v>

1116
00:38:36.761 --> 00:38:37.450
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

1117
00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:39.350
<v Speaker 4>and writing is a very good way of doing that.</v>

1118
00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:40.810
<v Speaker 4>And in the cell for three program,</v>

1119
00:38:40.811 --> 00:38:43.720
<v Speaker 4>you could write about your past and you could write about your personality and</v>

1120
00:38:43.721 --> 00:38:44.980
<v Speaker 4>then you can write about your future.</v>

1121
00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:45.910
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1122
00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:46.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1123
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:50.680
<v Speaker 4>one of the things I've learned from dealing with students forever is that in</v>

1124
00:38:50.681 --> 00:38:50.861
<v Speaker 4>our,</v>

1125
00:38:50.861 --> 00:38:52.300
<v Speaker 4>in our education system,</v>

1126
00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:54.010
<v Speaker 4>this is so weird,</v>

1127
00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:54.490
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1128
00:38:54.490 --> 00:38:56.410
<v Speaker 4>I've really struggled with this realization.</v>

1129
00:38:56.411 --> 00:38:57.910
<v Speaker 4>I've had it about 15 years ago.</v>

1130
00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:58.960
<v Speaker 4>We never said,</v>

1131
00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:03.910
<v Speaker 4>I have these students who have been in it in formal education for 16 years,</v>

1132
00:39:03.911 --> 00:39:04.450
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1133
00:39:04.450 --> 00:39:06.970
<v Speaker 4>And no one has ever sat them down even once and said,</v>

1134
00:39:06.971 --> 00:39:07.241
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1135
00:39:07.241 --> 00:39:08.074
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1136
00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:09.910
<v Speaker 4>you've got three hours,</v>

1137
00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:12.670
<v Speaker 4>right about who the hell you should be.</v>

1138
00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:15.310
<v Speaker 4>And I don't mean you're going to be a plumber or a lawyer or whatever.</v>

1139
00:39:15.311 --> 00:39:15.821
<v Speaker 4>Fair enough.</v>

1140
00:39:15.821 --> 00:39:16.270
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1141
00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:17.110
<v Speaker 4>that is what I mean.</v>

1142
00:39:17.111 --> 00:39:17.944
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1143
00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:18.873
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1144
00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:23.910
<v Speaker 4>what kind of character do you want to manifest in the world in detail,</v>

1145
00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:26.500
<v Speaker 4>and then why you think,</v>

1146
00:39:26.501 --> 00:39:27.334
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1147
00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:29.140
<v Speaker 4>why don't we teach people to do this?</v>

1148
00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:29.441
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1149
00:39:29.441 --> 00:39:30.610
<v Speaker 4>it's the only question,</v>

1150
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:32.380
<v Speaker 4>zoning relevant question.</v>

1151
00:39:32.381 --> 00:39:32.741
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1152
00:39:32.741 --> 00:39:36.460
<v Speaker 4>well if you can be who you could be,</v>

1153
00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:40.180
<v Speaker 4>let's imagine you had that within the palm of your hands since it would be</v>

1154
00:39:40.181 --> 00:39:43.180
<v Speaker 4>possible for you to be who you could be.</v>

1155
00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:45.520
<v Speaker 4>Let's say that's within you realm of,</v>

1156
00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:46.150
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

1157
00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:46.750
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

1158
00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:48.220
<v Speaker 4>of competence.</v>

1159
00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:50.140
<v Speaker 4>Who would that be?</v>

1160
00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:51.431
<v Speaker 4>And if that answer is,</v>

1161
00:39:51.431 --> 00:39:53.770
<v Speaker 4>well I don't know and that's the answer,</v>

1162
00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:55.270
<v Speaker 4>then give it up man.</v>

1163
00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:56.650
<v Speaker 4>Cause it,</v>

1164
00:39:56.650 --> 00:39:59.650
<v Speaker 4>cause you're not going to move forward with a plan like that.</v>

1165
00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:02.980
<v Speaker 4>You know like I think this is a psychological truth.</v>

1166
00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:07.030
<v Speaker 4>We know already that human perception is organized around aim.</v>

1167
00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:11.260
<v Speaker 4>Everything about us is organized around and even the way we use our eyes,</v>

1168
00:40:11.261 --> 00:40:12.790
<v Speaker 4>it's organized around the aim.</v>

1169
00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:13.380
<v Speaker 4>We're,</v>

1170
00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:13.651
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

1171
00:40:13.651 --> 00:40:17.890
<v Speaker 4>we're aiming creatures and how do you not hit something if you,</v>

1172
00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:18.521
<v Speaker 4>if you're,</v>

1173
00:40:18.521 --> 00:40:19.440
<v Speaker 4>if there's a target there,</v>

1174
00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:20.200
<v Speaker 4>how do you miss it?</v>

1175
00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:22.990
<v Speaker 4>Well one is not specified at the target.</v>

1176
00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:23.681
<v Speaker 4>So I,</v>

1177
00:40:23.681 --> 00:40:25.900
<v Speaker 4>how are you going to hit something if you don't specify it?</v>

1178
00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:27.343
<v Speaker 4>So it's like,</v>

1179
00:40:27.370 --> 00:40:29.380
<v Speaker 4>I know that for most people,</v>

1180
00:40:29.381 --> 00:40:31.240
<v Speaker 4>life is something that happens to them.</v>

1181
00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:33.970
<v Speaker 4>They're reacting to things all the time,</v>

1182
00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:36.880
<v Speaker 4>which means that they're tangled up in someone else's story,</v>

1183
00:40:37.090 --> 00:40:39.400
<v Speaker 4>or they're pawns in someone else's aims,</v>

1184
00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:43.540
<v Speaker 4>or they're pawns of the aims of their own unconscious processes not to.</v>

1185
00:40:44.110 --> 00:40:44.440
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

1186
00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:44.711
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1187
00:40:44.711 --> 00:40:47.920
<v Speaker 4>that's the case when you find yourself doing something that you can't believe</v>

1188
00:40:47.921 --> 00:40:48.641
<v Speaker 4>you did.</v>

1189
00:40:48.641 --> 00:40:48.851
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1190
00:40:48.851 --> 00:40:50.020
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe I did that.</v>

1191
00:40:50.021 --> 00:40:50.291
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1192
00:40:50.291 --> 00:40:50.531
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1193
00:40:50.531 --> 00:40:53.320
<v Speaker 4>well there's something Indian that had you,</v>

1194
00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:55.750
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't you or it was a dark part of,</v>

1195
00:40:55.751 --> 00:40:56.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1196
00:40:56.890 --> 00:40:58.480
<v Speaker 4>but there's nothing to replace that.</v>

1197
00:40:58.481 --> 00:41:00.040
<v Speaker 4>There's no super ordinate aim.</v>

1198
00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:01.930
<v Speaker 4>And so in the future authoring program,</v>

1199
00:41:01.931 --> 00:41:02.800
<v Speaker 4>we get people to,</v>

1200
00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:03.101
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1201
00:41:03.101 --> 00:41:04.330
<v Speaker 4>just to think about their lives,</v>

1202
00:41:04.331 --> 00:41:04.930
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1203
00:41:04.930 --> 00:41:05.860
<v Speaker 4>so there's this,</v>

1204
00:41:05.861 --> 00:41:08.140
<v Speaker 4>another injunction in the new testament is very strange.</v>

1205
00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:09.090
<v Speaker 4>One Says No,</v>

1206
00:41:09.091 --> 00:41:12.800
<v Speaker 4>Aka the door will open ask and you will receive if think,</v>

1207
00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:13.703
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1208
00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:15.490
<v Speaker 4>fat chance,</v>

1209
00:41:15.491 --> 00:41:15.850
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1210
00:41:15.850 --> 00:41:17.140
<v Speaker 4>Who's going to believe that?</v>

1211
00:41:17.141 --> 00:41:17.430
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1212
00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:18.310
<v Speaker 4>It's just to,</v>

1213
00:41:18.490 --> 00:41:22.930
<v Speaker 4>it's way too looks to naively optimistic to even possibly be true,</v>

1214
00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:23.600
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1215
00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:24.790
<v Speaker 4>but it's a strange thing.</v>

1216
00:41:24.791 --> 00:41:27.750
<v Speaker 4>And I've seen this over and over in my clinical and my consulting practice and</v>

1217
00:41:27.751 --> 00:41:28.584
<v Speaker 4>with my students,</v>

1218
00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:31.330
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you that if you don't aim at something,</v>

1219
00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:32.740
<v Speaker 4>you will not hit it.</v>

1220
00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:34.350
<v Speaker 4>And if you do a mad,</v>

1221
00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:38.400
<v Speaker 4>the probability that you'll at least get advanced in that direction,</v>

1222
00:41:38.401 --> 00:41:39.234
<v Speaker 4>it starts to,</v>

1223
00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:40.670
<v Speaker 4>you will.</v>

1224
00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:41.750
<v Speaker 4>That's what will happen.</v>

1225
00:41:41.751 --> 00:41:43.280
<v Speaker 4>Now you aim at something,</v>

1226
00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:44.810
<v Speaker 4>what the Hell do you know?</v>

1227
00:41:44.811 --> 00:41:45.120
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1228
00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:46.030
<v Speaker 4>You set up your aim,</v>

1229
00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:46.801
<v Speaker 4>you don't know anything.</v>

1230
00:41:46.801 --> 00:41:47.240
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>

1231
00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:49.670
<v Speaker 4>you're stupid in your aims just like you are and everything else.</v>

1232
00:41:49.671 --> 00:41:51.020
<v Speaker 4>But at least you're aiming at something.</v>

1233
00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:52.520
<v Speaker 4>You move towards it.</v>

1234
00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:53.960
<v Speaker 4>And as you move towards it,</v>

1235
00:41:53.961 --> 00:41:57.050
<v Speaker 4>you learn something because you're actually doing something.</v>

1236
00:41:57.230 --> 00:42:00.590
<v Speaker 4>You might learn precisely how stupid you were in your aims,</v>

1237
00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:02.270
<v Speaker 4>but you learn it precisely.</v>

1238
00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:06.530
<v Speaker 4>And that's so useful because once you learn something precisely like that,</v>

1239
00:42:06.531 --> 00:42:09.340
<v Speaker 4>then you can incorporate the knowledge and you can reformulate your aim.</v>

1240
00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:12.620
<v Speaker 4>And the next name is not quite so bone headed.</v>

1241
00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:15.650
<v Speaker 4>And so what you do is imagine you should be aiming here,</v>

1242
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:17.150
<v Speaker 4>but you don't know cause you're blind.</v>

1243
00:42:17.151 --> 00:42:18.560
<v Speaker 4>And maybe that's even moving.</v>

1244
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:19.730
<v Speaker 4>And so you're so blind,</v>

1245
00:42:19.731 --> 00:42:24.731
<v Speaker 4>you aim over here or you walk a little ways that you think no wrong.</v>

1246
00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:26.060
<v Speaker 4>Then you even over here,</v>

1247
00:42:26.090 --> 00:42:28.250
<v Speaker 4>you walk a little ways and you think no wrong.</v>

1248
00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:29.540
<v Speaker 4>And You keep doing that.</v>

1249
00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:31.420
<v Speaker 4>And like it's a winding path.</v>

1250
00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:31.940
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

1251
00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:33.720
<v Speaker 4>it's not the shortest point B,</v>

1252
00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:36.200
<v Speaker 4>not the shortest distance between point a and B,</v>

1253
00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:38.120
<v Speaker 4>but you're moving forward.</v>

1254
00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:40.010
<v Speaker 4>And so even if you're doing it badly,</v>

1255
00:42:40.011 --> 00:42:41.900
<v Speaker 4>you're approximating the ideal.</v>

1256
00:42:41.901 --> 00:42:42.850
<v Speaker 4>And the more you do that,</v>

1257
00:42:42.851 --> 00:42:43.880
<v Speaker 4>the better you get at it.</v>

1258
00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:45.800
<v Speaker 4>And that actually works.</v>

1259
00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:48.290
<v Speaker 4>And so we ask people,</v>

1260
00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:48.631
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1261
00:42:48.631 --> 00:42:48.981
<v Speaker 4>when you think,</v>

1262
00:42:48.981 --> 00:42:49.131
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1263
00:42:49.131 --> 00:42:49.940
<v Speaker 4>what's life?</v>

1264
00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:50.390
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1265
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.721
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

1266
00:42:50.721 --> 00:42:51.110
<v Speaker 4>what's,</v>

1267
00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:52.430
<v Speaker 4>what's your life made out of?</v>

1268
00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:52.881
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1269
00:42:52.881 --> 00:42:54.080
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty straight forward.</v>

1270
00:42:54.081 --> 00:42:54.860
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1271
00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:55.490
<v Speaker 4>you need,</v>

1272
00:42:55.490 --> 00:42:57.080
<v Speaker 4>you need some relationships,</v>

1273
00:42:57.140 --> 00:42:57.820
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1274
00:42:57.820 --> 00:42:59.000
<v Speaker 4>You've got to have some friends.</v>

1275
00:42:59.001 --> 00:42:59.571
<v Speaker 4>That'd be good.</v>

1276
00:42:59.571 --> 00:43:01.490
<v Speaker 4>Maybe some of you don't want friends.</v>

1277
00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:02.210
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1278
00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:04.610
<v Speaker 4>You're a peculiar sort and you don't need friends.</v>

1279
00:43:04.611 --> 00:43:07.610
<v Speaker 4>But from her daughter are some people who aren't that social,</v>

1280
00:43:07.611 --> 00:43:07.881
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1281
00:43:07.881 --> 00:43:09.530
<v Speaker 4>But broadly speaking,</v>

1282
00:43:09.531 --> 00:43:11.390
<v Speaker 4>a couple of friends is a good thing.</v>

1283
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:12.200
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1284
00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:14.300
<v Speaker 4>How many and who?</v>

1285
00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:16.730
<v Speaker 4>Who should get them for friends?</v>

1286
00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:17.301
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1287
00:43:17.301 --> 00:43:20.360
<v Speaker 4>you might take while people who are kind of on your side,</v>

1288
00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:21.381
<v Speaker 4>that'd be good.</v>

1289
00:43:21.381 --> 00:43:25.340
<v Speaker 4>Or maybe people who are at least aren't actively conspiring against you,</v>

1290
00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:26.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1291
00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:26.870
<v Speaker 4>and you think,</v>

1292
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:27.051
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1293
00:43:27.051 --> 00:43:29.240
<v Speaker 4>my friends go actively conspiring against me.</v>

1294
00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:29.571
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1295
00:43:29.571 --> 00:43:29.791
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1296
00:43:29.791 --> 00:43:31.910
<v Speaker 4>well you just think about it for a while and see if that's true.</v>

1297
00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:35.000
<v Speaker 4>It's same with your family members,</v>

1298
00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:36.770
<v Speaker 4>so you as well,</v>

1299
00:43:36.771 --> 00:43:37.020
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1300
00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:39.800
<v Speaker 4>Because you're actively conspiring against yourself as well.</v>

1301
00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:43.820
<v Speaker 4>So what if you could have the friends you wanted and you were doing the things</v>

1302
00:43:43.821 --> 00:43:44.331
<v Speaker 4>you want to quit?</v>

1303
00:43:44.331 --> 00:43:44.511
<v Speaker 4>Is that,</v>

1304
00:43:44.511 --> 00:43:45.500
<v Speaker 4>what would that look like?</v>

1305
00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:46.341
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>

1306
00:43:46.341 --> 00:43:49.070
<v Speaker 4>well what about your career or job?</v>

1307
00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:51.150
<v Speaker 4>Like what's that gonna look like you,</v>

1308
00:43:51.490 --> 00:43:53.720
<v Speaker 4>how are you gonna make sure you are as educated as you are,</v>

1309
00:43:53.721 --> 00:43:54.440
<v Speaker 4>intelligent,</v>

1310
00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:55.700
<v Speaker 4>something like that,</v>

1311
00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:58.790
<v Speaker 4>are you to take care of yourself mentally and physically?</v>

1312
00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:00.620
<v Speaker 4>If you could do it whatever way you want it,</v>

1313
00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:02.120
<v Speaker 4>how are you going to handle temptations,</v>

1314
00:44:02.121 --> 00:44:03.170
<v Speaker 4>drug and alcohol abuse,</v>

1315
00:44:03.171 --> 00:44:03.980
<v Speaker 4>for example?</v>

1316
00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:05.340
<v Speaker 4>How are we going to regulate that?</v>

1317
00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:10.040
<v Speaker 4>What are you going to do with your time outside of work that's productive and</v>

1318
00:44:10.041 --> 00:44:10.874
<v Speaker 4>meaningful?</v>

1319
00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:11.570
<v Speaker 4>Well that's,</v>

1320
00:44:11.570 --> 00:44:13.760
<v Speaker 4>that's not a bad start at six dimensions,</v>

1321
00:44:13.761 --> 00:44:14.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1322
00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:14.361
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1323
00:44:14.361 --> 00:44:14.601
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1324
00:44:14.601 --> 00:44:15.021
<v Speaker 4>you can have,</v>

1325
00:44:15.021 --> 00:44:18.500
<v Speaker 4>where do you want or you can have what you need if you were taking care of</v>

1326
00:44:18.501 --> 00:44:19.280
<v Speaker 4>yourself,</v>

1327
00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:20.360
<v Speaker 4>but you have to specify,</v>

1328
00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:21.590
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1329
00:44:21.590 --> 00:44:23.000
<v Speaker 4>so we tested that.</v>

1330
00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:23.170
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>

1331
00:44:23.170 --> 00:44:24.110
<v Speaker 4>we made this program,</v>

1332
00:44:24.111 --> 00:44:25.160
<v Speaker 4>we tested it in Holland,</v>

1333
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:31.000
<v Speaker 4>first tested in three universities and under pretty rocky conditions in one</v>

1334
00:44:31.501 --> 00:44:31.860
<v Speaker 4>college.</v>

1335
00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:35.850
<v Speaker 4>We just had kids come in for the summer orientation and just spend like an hour</v>

1336
00:44:35.851 --> 00:44:36.684
<v Speaker 4>writing.</v>

1337
00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:38.160
<v Speaker 4>So you're hardly even start,</v>

1338
00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:38.581
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1339
00:44:38.581 --> 00:44:38.821
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>

1340
00:44:38.821 --> 00:44:39.930
<v Speaker 4>with your plan.</v>

1341
00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:43.290
<v Speaker 4>But it's a plan and that means you're the planner.</v>

1342
00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:44.400
<v Speaker 4>That's a good thing to learn.</v>

1343
00:44:44.401 --> 00:44:49.401
<v Speaker 4>You're not just this thing that's being pushed back and forth by the bilingual</v>

1344
00:44:49.621 --> 00:44:50.450
<v Speaker 4>fate.</v>

1345
00:44:50.450 --> 00:44:54.510
<v Speaker 4>You've got the grip on things and you're at least contending.</v>

1346
00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:55.111
<v Speaker 4>So like,</v>

1347
00:44:55.111 --> 00:45:00.030
<v Speaker 4>well people were 25% more likely to stay in the university and the effect lasted</v>

1348
00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:01.440
<v Speaker 4>more than two years.</v>

1349
00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:02.820
<v Speaker 4>So that was amazing.</v>

1350
00:45:02.821 --> 00:45:06.420
<v Speaker 4>And great grades went up as well about the same amount and the people that had</v>

1351
00:45:06.421 --> 00:45:07.231
<v Speaker 4>helped the most,</v>

1352
00:45:07.231 --> 00:45:10.620
<v Speaker 4>which was really weird because usually if you do a psychological intervention,</v>

1353
00:45:10.621 --> 00:45:12.090
<v Speaker 4>you say that people not do it so well.</v>

1354
00:45:12.091 --> 00:45:13.590
<v Speaker 4>There's people who are doing pretty well.</v>

1355
00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:14.700
<v Speaker 4>You do an intervention.</v>

1356
00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:18.180
<v Speaker 4>The people who are doing well do even better and the people who aren't doing so</v>

1357
00:45:18.181 --> 00:45:18.630
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1358
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:20.070
<v Speaker 4>they just stay where they are.</v>

1359
00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:22.860
<v Speaker 4>But that isn't what happened with this intervention is the people that weren't</v>

1360
00:45:22.861 --> 00:45:25.200
<v Speaker 4>doing very well get way better.</v>

1361
00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:25.591
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>

1362
00:45:25.591 --> 00:45:26.670
<v Speaker 4>well they never had a plan.</v>

1363
00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:29.130
<v Speaker 4>So they make a halfhearted plant.</v>

1364
00:45:29.131 --> 00:45:29.730
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

1365
00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:30.810
<v Speaker 4>they're way better.</v>

1366
00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:32.033
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1367
00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:33.450
<v Speaker 4>so that's something to think about.</v>

1368
00:45:33.451 --> 00:45:36.590
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to take care of yourself because you should or because you're</v>

1369
00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:39.930
<v Speaker 4>compassionate or cause it's a moral or because you're compassionate.</v>

1370
00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:42.750
<v Speaker 4>Let's say you want to take care of yourself because,</v>

1371
00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:44.093
<v Speaker 4>well this is,</v>

1372
00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:47.460
<v Speaker 4>this is at the center of things as far as I'm concerned,</v>

1373
00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:51.720
<v Speaker 4>and this is something I truly believe despite my black heart and essential</v>

1374
00:45:51.721 --> 00:45:53.320
<v Speaker 4>pessimism is that you know,</v>

1375
00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:56.820
<v Speaker 4>every human being is a spectacular miracle.</v>

1376
00:45:57.390 --> 00:45:58.800
<v Speaker 4>That's really the case.</v>

1377
00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:03.110
<v Speaker 4>That's part of the secret.</v>

1378
00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:07.560
<v Speaker 4>That's part of the secret of the West is our legal system is predicated on that</v>

1379
00:46:07.561 --> 00:46:08.394
<v Speaker 4>idea.</v>

1380
00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:11.550
<v Speaker 4>It's predicated on the idea that you're made in the image of God,</v>

1381
00:46:11.551 --> 00:46:12.300
<v Speaker 4>let's say.</v>

1382
00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:17.300
<v Speaker 4>And then even the law has to stay a distance from you because you're just that</v>

1383
00:46:17.401 --> 00:46:18.270
<v Speaker 4>remarkable.</v>

1384
00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:20.430
<v Speaker 4>And I believe that that's as close.</v>

1385
00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:23.460
<v Speaker 4>That's literally true and metaphorically true at the same time.</v>

1386
00:46:23.730 --> 00:46:26.790
<v Speaker 4>And I think that everyone knows this because if you don't treat yourself like</v>

1387
00:46:26.791 --> 00:46:27.270
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1388
00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:28.620
<v Speaker 4>you don't do very well.</v>

1389
00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:32.240
<v Speaker 4>And if you have friends or family members and you don't treat them like that's</v>

1390
00:46:32.250 --> 00:46:32.790
<v Speaker 4>true,</v>

1391
00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:34.500
<v Speaker 4>they don't like him very much.</v>

1392
00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:39.780
<v Speaker 4>And if you organize a society on axiomatic principals that don't,</v>

1393
00:46:40.450 --> 00:46:44.940
<v Speaker 4>that don't include that idea that those societies become unproductive and</v>

1394
00:46:44.941 --> 00:46:47.340
<v Speaker 4>murderous almost instantly.</v>

1395
00:46:47.730 --> 00:46:49.230
<v Speaker 4>And so to me that indicates this.</v>

1396
00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:51.120
<v Speaker 4>There's something true about that.</v>

1397
00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:52.950
<v Speaker 4>Let's call it metaphysical claim.</v>

1398
00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:54.121
<v Speaker 4>And if it's true,</v>

1399
00:46:54.121 --> 00:46:56.460
<v Speaker 4>well then you have an obligation to take care of yourself.</v>

1400
00:46:56.461 --> 00:46:58.500
<v Speaker 4>And it's not just for you.</v>

1401
00:46:59.010 --> 00:46:59.671
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing.</v>

1402
00:46:59.671 --> 00:47:01.260
<v Speaker 4>It's not selfish exactly.</v>

1403
00:47:01.261 --> 00:47:03.600
<v Speaker 4>Although it is because you should take care of yourself.</v>

1404
00:47:03.601 --> 00:47:07.050
<v Speaker 4>But if you don't take care of yourself then like what the hell are you to your</v>

1405
00:47:07.051 --> 00:47:07.884
<v Speaker 4>family,</v>

1406
00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:08.791
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1407
00:47:08.791 --> 00:47:10.800
<v Speaker 4>and what are you good are you to your community?</v>

1408
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:14.520
<v Speaker 4>And it's like you might be really useful to your family.</v>

1409
00:47:14.730 --> 00:47:15.421
<v Speaker 4>You never know.</v>

1410
00:47:15.421 --> 00:47:15.691
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1411
00:47:15.691 --> 00:47:19.920
<v Speaker 4>you might be that the thing that stands in between them and some catastrophe and</v>

1412
00:47:19.921 --> 00:47:20.641
<v Speaker 4>for all you know,</v>

1413
00:47:20.641 --> 00:47:21.660
<v Speaker 4>you might be that,</v>

1414
00:47:21.690 --> 00:47:26.690
<v Speaker 4>that thing that stands in between your society and that catastrophe.</v>

1415
00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:29.440
<v Speaker 4>And I actually think that that's the case.</v>

1416
00:47:29.441 --> 00:47:29.651
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1417
00:47:29.651 --> 00:47:34.030
<v Speaker 4>I read the great commentators on the 20th century catastrophes,</v>

1418
00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:39.060
<v Speaker 4>right and left wing alike and the really profound ones all say the same thing.</v>

1419
00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:41.470
<v Speaker 4>Society's degenerate it to hell.</v>

1420
00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:44.350
<v Speaker 4>When individuals abdicate their moral responsibility.</v>

1421
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:49.900
<v Speaker 4>It's like there's a direct connection between you stepping up to the plate,</v>

1422
00:47:49.901 --> 00:47:50.291
<v Speaker 4>say it,</v>

1423
00:47:50.291 --> 00:47:53.590
<v Speaker 4>relationship to yourself at the stability of the world.</v>

1424
00:47:53.591 --> 00:47:55.240
<v Speaker 4>And I actually think it goes beyond that.</v>

1425
00:47:55.241 --> 00:47:56.890
<v Speaker 4>I truly believe this.</v>

1426
00:47:57.190 --> 00:48:01.060
<v Speaker 4>I think we don't construe who we are properly.</v>

1427
00:48:01.061 --> 00:48:01.540
<v Speaker 4>We don't know.</v>

1428
00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:03.940
<v Speaker 4>We don't articulate it properly even though we act it out.</v>

1429
00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:09.300
<v Speaker 4>I think that what you confront in life is something like an infinite landscape</v>

1430
00:48:09.341 --> 00:48:10.210
<v Speaker 4>of potential.</v>

1431
00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:11.530
<v Speaker 4>That's the future.</v>

1432
00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:13.140
<v Speaker 4>You don't live in the present,</v>

1433
00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:16.270
<v Speaker 4>the presence already here and the past.</v>

1434
00:48:16.271 --> 00:48:17.140
<v Speaker 4>It's too late,</v>

1435
00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:20.710
<v Speaker 4>but the future is right in front of you and you're,</v>

1436
00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:23.320
<v Speaker 4>you're interacting with that potential future.</v>

1437
00:48:23.321 --> 00:48:27.100
<v Speaker 4>It could go this way or it could go that way and you can see those potentials</v>

1438
00:48:27.101 --> 00:48:30.970
<v Speaker 4>manifest themselves in front of you and you make these decisions about which</v>

1439
00:48:30.971 --> 00:48:34.270
<v Speaker 4>part of that you're going to make into concrete reality.</v>

1440
00:48:34.810 --> 00:48:36.610
<v Speaker 4>And so I don't think that it's just,</v>

1441
00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:40.330
<v Speaker 4>it isn't just your stability that your decisions depending on,</v>

1442
00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:43.600
<v Speaker 4>it's not just your family's stability and flourishing.</v>

1443
00:48:43.601 --> 00:48:45.160
<v Speaker 4>It's not just society.</v>

1444
00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:45.820
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>

1445
00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:48.280
<v Speaker 4>Those are all important things and they all stack up.</v>

1446
00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:53.230
<v Speaker 4>I think that you play a role in directing the structure of reality itself,</v>

1447
00:48:53.290 --> 00:48:55.360
<v Speaker 4>and I think you bloody well know that.</v>

1448
00:48:55.390 --> 00:48:57.670
<v Speaker 4>And we call each other on it all the time saying,</v>

1449
00:48:57.671 --> 00:48:59.530
<v Speaker 4>you're not living up to your possibility.</v>

1450
00:48:59.590 --> 00:49:01.360
<v Speaker 4>You're not living up to your potential.</v>

1451
00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:02.201
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1452
00:49:02.201 --> 00:49:03.430
<v Speaker 4>what the hell does that mean?</v>

1453
00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:05.440
<v Speaker 4>Everyone says it.</v>

1454
00:49:05.890 --> 00:49:08.800
<v Speaker 4>Everyone's embarrassed because they know it's true.</v>

1455
00:49:08.830 --> 00:49:09.910
<v Speaker 4>You're not living up to your party.</v>

1456
00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:10.680
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

1457
00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:10.990
<v Speaker 4>God.</v>

1458
00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:11.823
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1459
00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:12.371
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

1460
00:49:12.371 --> 00:49:13.030
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

1461
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:14.350
<v Speaker 4>Don't bother me about it.</v>

1462
00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:16.900
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're ashamed of that.</v>

1463
00:49:17.010 --> 00:49:17.140
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1464
00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:18.940
<v Speaker 4>why wouldn't you be ashamed of it?</v>

1465
00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:20.320
<v Speaker 4>You are.</v>

1466
00:49:20.690 --> 00:49:21.523
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

1467
00:49:22.210 --> 00:49:22.331
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1468
00:49:22.331 --> 00:49:23.920
<v Speaker 4>because it actually matters.</v>

1469
00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:28.750
<v Speaker 4>Like it really matters unless you think that it's okay for things to degenerate</v>

1470
00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:31.090
<v Speaker 4>and we'll talk about that in a little it a little bit.</v>

1471
00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:32.620
<v Speaker 4>So that's rule too.</v>

1472
00:49:32.650 --> 00:49:34.510
<v Speaker 4>It's like that's worth and like,</v>

1473
00:49:34.511 --> 00:49:34.781
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1474
00:49:34.781 --> 00:49:39.781
<v Speaker 4>I came to this realization it wasn't an easy realization to come to you because</v>

1475
00:49:39.881 --> 00:49:41.680
<v Speaker 4>it just doesn't seem that self evident.</v>

1476
00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:44.650
<v Speaker 4>But I'm telling you when people like Viktor Frankl and Alexandra social</v>

1477
00:49:44.651 --> 00:49:45.430
<v Speaker 4>medicine,</v>

1478
00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:50.430
<v Speaker 4>Vaclav Havel people who really grappled with the horrors of the 20th century,</v>

1479
00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:54.220
<v Speaker 4>trying to understand how a society like East Germany could emerge,</v>

1480
00:49:54.221 --> 00:49:57.160
<v Speaker 4>where one in three people was a government informer.</v>

1481
00:49:57.340 --> 00:50:01.420
<v Speaker 4>Imagine that you get six people in your family and two of them are informing on</v>

1482
00:50:01.421 --> 00:50:02.320
<v Speaker 4>you to the government.</v>

1483
00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:03.640
<v Speaker 4>How does the society,</v>

1484
00:50:03.730 --> 00:50:04.840
<v Speaker 4>how does that happen?</v>

1485
00:50:05.830 --> 00:50:05.981
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1486
00:50:05.981 --> 00:50:09.400
<v Speaker 4>it happens because if the individuals in the society abdicated their moral</v>

1487
00:50:09.401 --> 00:50:10.234
<v Speaker 4>responsibility,</v>

1488
00:50:10.450 --> 00:50:11.590
<v Speaker 4>that's how it happens.</v>

1489
00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:12.371
<v Speaker 4>You might take.</v>

1490
00:50:12.371 --> 00:50:12.581
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1491
00:50:12.581 --> 00:50:14.380
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people have to do that.</v>

1492
00:50:14.381 --> 00:50:15.010
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1493
00:50:15.010 --> 00:50:15.580
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1494
00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:17.650
<v Speaker 4>we don't know how many people have to do that before.</v>

1495
00:50:17.651 --> 00:50:22.651
<v Speaker 4>Things tilt seriously sideways and it might not have to be that many and it does</v>

1496
00:50:23.081 --> 00:50:23.914
<v Speaker 4>matter.</v>

1497
00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:25.840
<v Speaker 4>I see people,</v>

1498
00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:27.170
<v Speaker 4>this is actually,</v>

1499
00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:29.240
<v Speaker 4>I decided to do what I did with regards to these.</v>

1500
00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:32.720
<v Speaker 4>He stamps on compelled speech in Canada.</v>

1501
00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:33.200
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1502
00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:34.100
<v Speaker 4>people would be panicking,</v>

1503
00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:44.680
<v Speaker 4>patted me on my dock for my bravery and I'm saying,</v>

1504
00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:44.891
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1505
00:50:44.891 --> 00:50:45.580
<v Speaker 4>no you don't.</v>

1506
00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:46.590
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to stamp.</v>

1507
00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:48.610
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's not bravery.</v>

1508
00:50:48.970 --> 00:50:50.740
<v Speaker 4>It's fear of the right things.</v>

1509
00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:52.300
<v Speaker 4>That's wisdom.</v>

1510
00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:55.030
<v Speaker 4>Wisdom is fear of the right things.</v>

1511
00:50:55.450 --> 00:51:00.430
<v Speaker 4>You think what you think that it's dangerous to say what you have to say.</v>

1512
00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:03.760
<v Speaker 4>But say he just tried not saying what you have to say.</v>

1513
00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:07.000
<v Speaker 4>He just tried out for 10 years and see where the hell you go.</v>

1514
00:51:07.210 --> 00:51:09.490
<v Speaker 4>Because every time you have something to say,</v>

1515
00:51:09.550 --> 00:51:10.960
<v Speaker 4>which is something to live right,</v>

1516
00:51:10.961 --> 00:51:12.040
<v Speaker 4>there's no difference.</v>

1517
00:51:12.130 --> 00:51:12.963
<v Speaker 4>There's no difference.</v>

1518
00:51:13.090 --> 00:51:16.060
<v Speaker 4>Every time you have something to say something to live in,</v>

1519
00:51:16.061 --> 00:51:17.650
<v Speaker 4>you step backwards.</v>

1520
00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:18.510
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1521
00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:19.780
<v Speaker 4>they don't want to cause any trouble,</v>

1522
00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:20.051
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1523
00:51:20.051 --> 00:51:20.770
<v Speaker 4>And Fair enough.</v>

1524
00:51:20.770 --> 00:51:21.011
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1525
00:51:21.011 --> 00:51:22.990
<v Speaker 4>because don't go causing too much trouble,</v>

1526
00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:24.690
<v Speaker 4>but it's cleaning out you.</v>

1527
00:51:24.691 --> 00:51:25.630
<v Speaker 4>You have something to say.</v>

1528
00:51:25.631 --> 00:51:25.991
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1529
00:51:25.991 --> 00:51:26.350
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1530
00:51:26.350 --> 00:51:28.000
<v Speaker 4>I don't need to do what.</v>

1531
00:51:28.001 --> 00:51:29.290
<v Speaker 4>I don't want the conflict.</v>

1532
00:51:29.291 --> 00:51:30.250
<v Speaker 4>I don't want the trouble.</v>

1533
00:51:30.251 --> 00:51:30.940
<v Speaker 4>It's like fine,</v>

1534
00:51:30.940 --> 00:51:31.541
<v Speaker 4>no problem.</v>

1535
00:51:31.541 --> 00:51:32.374
<v Speaker 4>No problem.</v>

1536
00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:33.790
<v Speaker 4>You're an inch shorter.</v>

1537
00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:36.880
<v Speaker 4>And the people who are conspiring,</v>

1538
00:51:36.881 --> 00:51:41.881
<v Speaker 4>let's say against your essential best interests are three inches taller.</v>

1539
00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:43.600
<v Speaker 4>You think no will see it.</v>

1540
00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:44.770
<v Speaker 4>See something in the future.</v>

1541
00:51:44.771 --> 00:51:48.040
<v Speaker 4>It's no you won't because you'll end up an inch tall facing a monster.</v>

1542
00:51:48.190 --> 00:51:50.410
<v Speaker 4>And if you can't speak now,</v>

1543
00:51:50.470 --> 00:51:53.970
<v Speaker 4>what the hell makes you think you're going to speak when that is the situation?</v>

1544
00:51:54.430 --> 00:51:58.680
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

1545
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:02.743
<v Speaker 1>so when</v>

1546
00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:05.340
<v Speaker 1>you started it</v>

1547
00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:06.173
<v Speaker 4>to oppose,</v>

1548
00:52:06.450 --> 00:52:08.530
<v Speaker 4>would I decided to oppose this legislation?</v>

1549
00:52:08.531 --> 00:52:09.364
<v Speaker 4>I thought,</v>

1550
00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:10.453
<v Speaker 1>well I got,</v>

1551
00:52:10.990 --> 00:52:11.823
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1552
00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:16.950
<v Speaker 4>catastrophe to the left could catastrophe to the right and that's good thing to</v>

1553
00:52:16.951 --> 00:52:17.790
<v Speaker 4>know about life.</v>

1554
00:52:18.570 --> 00:52:21.160
<v Speaker 4>That's a good thing to know is that lots of times,</v>

1555
00:52:21.161 --> 00:52:22.020
<v Speaker 4>so that's what you've got.</v>

1556
00:52:22.590 --> 00:52:24.840
<v Speaker 4>There is no easy way forward.</v>

1557
00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:26.460
<v Speaker 4>There is no easy way forward in life,</v>

1558
00:52:26.461 --> 00:52:28.350
<v Speaker 4>period that that just doesn't exist.</v>

1559
00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:30.000
<v Speaker 4>You get to pick your catastrophe.</v>

1560
00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:35.310
<v Speaker 4>And I knew by that point that I'd rather have the catastrophe of say what I have</v>

1561
00:52:35.311 --> 00:52:37.620
<v Speaker 4>to say that in the catastrophe of not saying it.</v>

1562
00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:39.270
<v Speaker 4>And that's not bravery.</v>

1563
00:52:39.271 --> 00:52:40.140
<v Speaker 4>It's just why do you,</v>

1564
00:52:40.141 --> 00:52:40.560
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1565
00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:42.390
<v Speaker 4>it's openminded attention,</v>

1566
00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:43.050
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1567
00:52:43.050 --> 00:52:44.520
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's,</v>

1568
00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:48.600
<v Speaker 4>it's wisdom garnered from looking at how things go catastrophic.</v>

1569
00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:52.260
<v Speaker 4>Raul and deciding that I'd rather not participate in that.</v>

1570
00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:53.713
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1571
00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:00.390
<v Speaker 4>so brutal.</v>

1572
00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:01.300
<v Speaker 4>Three,</v>

1573
00:53:01.870 --> 00:53:04.000
<v Speaker 4>make friends with the people who want the best for you.</v>

1574
00:53:05.810 --> 00:53:07.280
<v Speaker 1>That's a hard chapter.</v>

1575
00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:11.390
<v Speaker 4>You don't because it's an extension of the moral obligation idea.</v>

1576
00:53:11.790 --> 00:53:11.991
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>

1577
00:53:11.991 --> 00:53:16.520
<v Speaker 4>this psychologist named Carl Rogers and Carl Rogers had this idea that in</v>

1578
00:53:16.521 --> 00:53:20.780
<v Speaker 4>therapy you should have unconditional positive regard for your clients.</v>

1579
00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:22.910
<v Speaker 4>And he didn't really act that way.</v>

1580
00:53:22.911 --> 00:53:24.290
<v Speaker 4>And that's because you actually can't.</v>

1581
00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:24.810
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1582
00:53:24.810 --> 00:53:24.960
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1583
00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:27.520
<v Speaker 4>but there was something about what Roger said was,</v>

1584
00:53:27.521 --> 00:53:28.354
<v Speaker 4>was right.</v>

1585
00:53:28.660 --> 00:53:30.500
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't formulated quite right here.</v>

1586
00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:32.273
<v Speaker 4>You want to have,</v>

1587
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:36.270
<v Speaker 4>so I reformulated and I think I got a closer to what it should be.</v>

1588
00:53:36.770 --> 00:53:40.890
<v Speaker 4>When I see my clinical clients or when I interact with people in general,</v>

1589
00:53:40.891 --> 00:53:42.210
<v Speaker 4>what I try to do is to take,</v>

1590
00:53:42.211 --> 00:53:42.780
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1591
00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:45.570
<v Speaker 4>there's part of you working for you and there's part of you that isn't working</v>

1592
00:53:45.571 --> 00:53:46.140
<v Speaker 4>for you.</v>

1593
00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:49.350
<v Speaker 4>That's that eternal divide in the human psyche.</v>

1594
00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:49.651
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1595
00:53:49.651 --> 00:53:52.800
<v Speaker 4>There's a division in all of us between good and evil essentially,</v>

1596
00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:54.150
<v Speaker 4>which is a real division.</v>

1597
00:53:54.210 --> 00:53:55.560
<v Speaker 4>It's a real division,</v>

1598
00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:56.550
<v Speaker 4>that's for sure.</v>

1599
00:53:57.660 --> 00:54:00.690
<v Speaker 4>What I want to be with my clients is I want to be on the side of the part of</v>

1600
00:54:00.691 --> 00:54:05.310
<v Speaker 4>them that's on their side and I'm not on the side of the part of them that's not</v>

1601
00:54:05.311 --> 00:54:07.140
<v Speaker 4>on their side at all.</v>

1602
00:54:07.170 --> 00:54:07.531
<v Speaker 4>It's right.</v>

1603
00:54:07.531 --> 00:54:09.180
<v Speaker 4>That part can just go,</v>

1604
00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:12.570
<v Speaker 4>that part can just go to hell.</v>

1605
00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:13.650
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

1606
00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:13.981
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1607
00:54:13.981 --> 00:54:18.420
<v Speaker 4>Which is where it's headed and so and that's the thing that you also want from</v>

1608
00:54:18.421 --> 00:54:19.380
<v Speaker 4>your friends.</v>

1609
00:54:19.770 --> 00:54:20.541
<v Speaker 4>I think again,</v>

1610
00:54:20.541 --> 00:54:23.550
<v Speaker 4>that that falls under the rubric of moral obligation.</v>

1611
00:54:23.850 --> 00:54:24.091
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1612
00:54:24.091 --> 00:54:25.860
<v Speaker 4>you want to have friends.</v>

1613
00:54:25.890 --> 00:54:27.450
<v Speaker 4>This doesn't mean you shouldn't help people.</v>

1614
00:54:27.451 --> 00:54:28.680
<v Speaker 4>That that isn't what I mean.</v>

1615
00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:32.070
<v Speaker 4>I don't mean that at all because everybody needs a hand from time to time.</v>

1616
00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:33.473
<v Speaker 4>But</v>

1617
00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:39.620
<v Speaker 4>you are obliged to surround yourself with people who are aiming up</v>

1618
00:54:41.310 --> 00:54:41.940
<v Speaker 4>fundamentally,</v>

1619
00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:43.440
<v Speaker 4>even in their flawed way.</v>

1620
00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:43.741
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1621
00:54:43.741 --> 00:54:45.660
<v Speaker 4>like everybody's got their problems,</v>

1622
00:54:45.870 --> 00:54:48.510
<v Speaker 4>but you're obliged to be around people that are aiming up.</v>

1623
00:54:48.570 --> 00:54:49.860
<v Speaker 4>If you're not.</v>

1624
00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:53.310
<v Speaker 4>Part of that is you don't want the ethical burden of surrounding yourself with</v>

1625
00:54:53.311 --> 00:54:55.590
<v Speaker 4>people who are aiming up cause they make you look bad.</v>

1626
00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:58.410
<v Speaker 4>And that's not an excuse to have friends that aren't good for you.</v>

1627
00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:02.280
<v Speaker 4>It's also not an excuse to have family members that aren't good for you.</v>

1628
00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:02.551
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1629
00:55:02.551 --> 00:55:06.360
<v Speaker 4>and I've had did my clinical practice and in particular I've had situations</v>

1630
00:55:06.361 --> 00:55:10.470
<v Speaker 4>where the best thing for my client to do was to cut themselves off from almost</v>

1631
00:55:10.471 --> 00:55:12.240
<v Speaker 4>all of their family almost completely.</v>

1632
00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:17.040
<v Speaker 4>There was just no other possible way because they were surrounded by people who</v>

1633
00:55:17.041 --> 00:55:20.430
<v Speaker 4>were hell bent on destruction.</v>

1634
00:55:21.390 --> 00:55:22.470
<v Speaker 4>And so you think,</v>

1635
00:55:22.471 --> 00:55:22.681
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1636
00:55:22.681 --> 00:55:24.120
<v Speaker 4>you know these people you love.</v>

1637
00:55:24.121 --> 00:55:24.570
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1638
00:55:24.570 --> 00:55:25.050
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1639
00:55:25.050 --> 00:55:25.650
<v Speaker 4>fair enough.</v>

1640
00:55:25.650 --> 00:55:26.310
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1641
00:55:26.310 --> 00:55:27.001
<v Speaker 4>I get that.</v>

1642
00:55:27.001 --> 00:55:29.250
<v Speaker 4>And it's no fun being alone and it's no fun.</v>

1643
00:55:29.850 --> 00:55:33.420
<v Speaker 4>Distancing yourself from people you love that hate you.</v>

1644
00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:34.823
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

1645
00:55:36.090 --> 00:55:36.923
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1646
00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:37.793
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

1647
00:55:42.170 --> 00:55:42.750
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1648
00:55:42.750 --> 00:55:44.380
<v Speaker 4>And so that's rule of three and he's like,</v>

1649
00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:47.110
<v Speaker 4>what's a hard book?</v>

1650
00:55:47.111 --> 00:55:47.710
<v Speaker 4>This one?</v>

1651
00:55:47.710 --> 00:55:48.501
<v Speaker 4>So Harsh Cook,</v>

1652
00:55:48.501 --> 00:55:49.334
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>

1653
00:55:56.690 --> 00:55:57.530
<v Speaker 4>Rule for,</v>

1654
00:55:59.060 --> 00:56:00.650
<v Speaker 4>compare yourself to who</v>

1655
00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:03.800
<v Speaker 4>you were yesterday,</v>

1656
00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:06.410
<v Speaker 4>not to who's someone else's today.</v>

1657
00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:09.860
<v Speaker 4>So I formulated that rule because,</v>

1658
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:12.560
<v Speaker 4>because I'm just thinking about hierarchy again.</v>

1659
00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:15.710
<v Speaker 4>So we already talked about the downside of new hierarchy.</v>

1660
00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:19.430
<v Speaker 4>The downside is while there's some people on the top and there's some people at</v>

1661
00:56:19.431 --> 00:56:22.430
<v Speaker 4>the bottom and the bottom is a painful place to be.</v>

1662
00:56:22.460 --> 00:56:26.800
<v Speaker 4>And so what are the consequences of erecting a hierarchy is that you erect a</v>

1663
00:56:26.801 --> 00:56:30.280
<v Speaker 4>structure of inequality and then that can get really steep and out of control.</v>

1664
00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:31.360
<v Speaker 4>That's a big risk,</v>

1665
00:56:31.361 --> 00:56:31.990
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1666
00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:32.651
<v Speaker 4>So you might think,</v>

1667
00:56:32.651 --> 00:56:32.861
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1668
00:56:32.861 --> 00:56:35.230
<v Speaker 4>let's get flat and the hierarchies,</v>

1669
00:56:35.770 --> 00:56:37.210
<v Speaker 4>so everyone's equal.</v>

1670
00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:38.711
<v Speaker 4>Well then you think,</v>

1671
00:56:38.711 --> 00:56:38.891
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1672
00:56:38.891 --> 00:56:39.724
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

1673
00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:41.020
<v Speaker 4>you really,</v>

1674
00:56:41.930 --> 00:56:43.540
<v Speaker 4>you want to flatten all the hierarchy,</v>

1675
00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:45.410
<v Speaker 4>which hierarchies you can leave in time,</v>

1676
00:56:45.490 --> 00:56:46.323
<v Speaker 4>any of them.</v>

1677
00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:49.090
<v Speaker 4>You should be no differences between people at all,</v>

1678
00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:50.073
<v Speaker 4>really?</v>

1679
00:56:50.410 --> 00:56:51.670
<v Speaker 4>Or we're going to draw some line.</v>

1680
00:56:51.671 --> 00:56:54.520
<v Speaker 4>There were some differences are okay at other differences aren't okay.</v>

1681
00:56:54.610 --> 00:56:56.080
<v Speaker 4>Who's going to draw those lines?</v>

1682
00:56:56.081 --> 00:56:56.914
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

1683
00:56:56.950 --> 00:57:01.210
<v Speaker 4>I mean exactly who's going to draw those lines and answer that is the people</v>

1684
00:57:01.211 --> 00:57:03.130
<v Speaker 4>that you least want to draw those lines,</v>

1685
00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:06.400
<v Speaker 4>that'll be the answer because they'll be the only ones interested in doing it.</v>

1686
00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:10.273
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1687
00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:12.340
<v Speaker 4>but then,</v>

1688
00:57:12.340 --> 00:57:14.350
<v Speaker 4>but we can give more deeply into it too.</v>

1689
00:57:14.351 --> 00:57:15.010
<v Speaker 4>So here,</v>

1690
00:57:15.010 --> 00:57:15.551
<v Speaker 4>here's a,</v>

1691
00:57:15.551 --> 00:57:16.300
<v Speaker 4>here's a,</v>

1692
00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:18.310
<v Speaker 4>here's a peculiarity about human beings.</v>

1693
00:57:18.550 --> 00:57:19.810
<v Speaker 4>So we could start from,</v>

1694
00:57:20.590 --> 00:57:22.390
<v Speaker 4>we can start from a dark place,</v>

1695
00:57:22.450 --> 00:57:23.950
<v Speaker 4>cause that's always realistic.</v>

1696
00:57:24.190 --> 00:57:25.640
<v Speaker 4>People believe in dark places,</v>

1697
00:57:25.641 --> 00:57:25.870
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1698
00:57:25.870 --> 00:57:28.000
<v Speaker 4>Everyone believes you believe in your pain.</v>

1699
00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:30.730
<v Speaker 4>No one doesn't believe in their pain,</v>

1700
00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:31.810
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1701
00:57:31.810 --> 00:57:34.900
<v Speaker 4>Nobody's an agnostic with regards to their pain.</v>

1702
00:57:34.990 --> 00:57:37.210
<v Speaker 4>Everyone believes that it's real or acts like it.</v>

1703
00:57:37.211 --> 00:57:39.820
<v Speaker 4>So we could start their life is painful,</v>

1704
00:57:40.010 --> 00:57:40.840
<v Speaker 4>had PR it.</v>

1705
00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:42.130
<v Speaker 4>It's emotionally painful,</v>

1706
00:57:42.131 --> 00:57:43.600
<v Speaker 4>it's anxiety provoking.</v>

1707
00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:45.700
<v Speaker 4>And then of course there's the malevolence aspect,</v>

1708
00:57:45.701 --> 00:57:46.840
<v Speaker 4>which makes it even worse.</v>

1709
00:57:46.841 --> 00:57:50.470
<v Speaker 4>And so that's the baseline and you're stuck with it.</v>

1710
00:57:50.580 --> 00:57:53.260
<v Speaker 4>And there are times when it will become excruciating,</v>

1711
00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:53.591
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1712
00:57:53.591 --> 00:57:55.300
<v Speaker 4>To the point of being unbearable.</v>

1713
00:57:55.540 --> 00:57:55.781
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1714
00:57:55.781 --> 00:57:58.180
<v Speaker 4>you see people fight at a death bed.</v>

1715
00:57:58.270 --> 00:58:01.180
<v Speaker 4>That's a good example of a nice combination of catastrophe.</v>

1716
00:58:01.181 --> 00:58:02.110
<v Speaker 4>And malevolence right?</v>

1717
00:58:02.111 --> 00:58:03.640
<v Speaker 4>Because it's already pretty bad.</v>

1718
00:58:03.641 --> 00:58:05.410
<v Speaker 4>Someone's dying and that's bad.</v>

1719
00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:05.741
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1720
00:58:05.741 --> 00:58:06.001
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1721
00:58:06.001 --> 00:58:08.800
<v Speaker 4>but little work you can make it a lot worse.</v>

1722
00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:12.970
<v Speaker 4>So I've often wondered,</v>

1723
00:58:12.971 --> 00:58:13.241
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1724
00:58:13.241 --> 00:58:16.840
<v Speaker 4>just exactly what would be left of the tragedy of life if people just didn't</v>

1725
00:58:16.841 --> 00:58:18.130
<v Speaker 4>make things worse.</v>

1726
00:58:18.790 --> 00:58:22.540
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things I have observed as a clinician is that people can tolerate</v>

1727
00:58:22.541 --> 00:58:23.710
<v Speaker 4>quite a lot of tragedy,</v>

1728
00:58:24.430 --> 00:58:29.430
<v Speaker 4>but they can't tolerate very much having everyone make it worse just for the</v>

1729
00:58:29.441 --> 00:58:31.210
<v Speaker 4>sake of making it worse.</v>

1730
00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:31.901
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1731
00:58:31.901 --> 00:58:35.590
<v Speaker 4>And that really hurts people if you're around people who are bringing you down</v>

1732
00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:38.320
<v Speaker 4>just for the sake of seeing you suffer,</v>

1733
00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:40.750
<v Speaker 4>that really does hurt people a lot.</v>

1734
00:58:40.810 --> 00:58:41.630
<v Speaker 4>That's my level.</v>

1735
00:58:41.630 --> 00:58:41.721
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1736
00:58:41.721 --> 00:58:46.060
<v Speaker 4>I think that's the best definition of evil really is to produce suffering for</v>

1737
00:58:46.061 --> 00:58:47.260
<v Speaker 4>the sake of the suffering.</v>

1738
00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:48.730
<v Speaker 4>It's like an art form.</v>

1739
00:58:49.300 --> 00:58:49.991
<v Speaker 4>It really is.</v>

1740
00:58:49.991 --> 00:58:51.210
<v Speaker 4>It's the right way to think about it.</v>

1741
00:58:51.260 --> 00:58:53.320
<v Speaker 4>People don't like to think that way because well,</v>

1742
00:58:53.321 --> 00:58:54.370
<v Speaker 4>for obvious reasons,</v>

1743
00:58:54.371 --> 00:58:56.110
<v Speaker 4>like who would make an art form of evil?</v>

1744
00:58:56.110 --> 00:58:56.680
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1745
00:58:56.680 --> 00:59:00.340
<v Speaker 4>how about the guy who shot up the elementary school in Connecticut?</v>

1746
00:59:00.850 --> 00:59:01.683
<v Speaker 4>How about him?</v>

1747
00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:04.060
<v Speaker 4>You don't think that was an artistic statement.</v>

1748
00:59:04.180 --> 00:59:05.980
<v Speaker 4>You just don't have the imagination for it.</v>

1749
00:59:05.981 --> 00:59:07.180
<v Speaker 4>If you don't think that,</v>

1750
00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:07.391
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1751
00:59:07.391 --> 00:59:08.230
<v Speaker 4>just think about it,</v>

1752
00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:08.981
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1753
00:59:08.981 --> 00:59:12.490
<v Speaker 4>You're going to make an artistic statement that's associated with malevolence.</v>

1754
00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:13.001
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1755
00:59:13.001 --> 00:59:14.260
<v Speaker 4>who are you going to hurt?</v>

1756
00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:15.460
<v Speaker 4>Well on?</v>

1757
00:59:15.460 --> 00:59:16.270
<v Speaker 4>Not adults.</v>

1758
00:59:16.270 --> 00:59:16.511
<v Speaker 4>These,</v>

1759
00:59:16.511 --> 00:59:18.760
<v Speaker 4>they're guilty of something for God's sake.</v>

1760
00:59:19.090 --> 00:59:20.410
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to go after the adults,</v>

1761
00:59:20.411 --> 00:59:22.130
<v Speaker 4>even if they're innocent adults.</v>

1762
00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:22.461
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1763
00:59:22.461 --> 00:59:23.690
<v Speaker 4>he'd go after children,</v>

1764
00:59:24.110 --> 00:59:25.400
<v Speaker 4>elementary school children.</v>

1765
00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:28.220
<v Speaker 4>You really want to make a statement that's malevolent.</v>

1766
00:59:28.820 --> 00:59:31.670
<v Speaker 4>Then you do the worst thing he could think of to the people who deserve it the</v>

1767
00:59:31.671 --> 00:59:32.504
<v Speaker 4>least.</v>

1768
00:59:32.930 --> 00:59:35.570
<v Speaker 4>And if you don't think that there's an aesthetic element to that,</v>

1769
00:59:35.571 --> 00:59:39.020
<v Speaker 4>like a considered a deeply considered aesthetic element,</v>

1770
00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:43.990
<v Speaker 4>then well then you have thought about it very much and I can understand why he's</v>

1771
00:59:43.991 --> 00:59:44.151
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1772
00:59:44.151 --> 00:59:45.400
<v Speaker 4>who wants to think that way?</v>

1773
00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:46.311
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

1774
00:59:46.311 --> 00:59:50.610
<v Speaker 4>we need to understand these things because they keep happening and,</v>

1775
00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:53.680
<v Speaker 4>and you don't understand them without going very dark places.</v>

1776
00:59:54.020 --> 00:59:57.470
<v Speaker 4>Chapter six in my book is called putting your house in perfect order before you</v>

1777
00:59:57.471 --> 00:59:58.340
<v Speaker 4>criticize the world.</v>

1778
00:59:58.341 --> 01:00:00.730
<v Speaker 4>And it's actually about the mass murderers.</v>

1779
01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:03.140
<v Speaker 4>And why they do what they do.</v>

1780
01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:04.910
<v Speaker 4>And I know why they do what they do.</v>

1781
01:00:04.911 --> 01:00:06.980
<v Speaker 4>I'm actually make a case for it in the chapter.</v>

1782
01:00:06.981 --> 01:00:07.460
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1783
01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:08.210
<v Speaker 4>here's the reason,</v>

1784
01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:10.370
<v Speaker 4>here's it's perfectly understandable.</v>

1785
01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:11.660
<v Speaker 4>Life is very,</v>

1786
01:00:11.661 --> 01:00:12.260
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>

1787
01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:16.400
<v Speaker 4>very difficult and it's often unfair and were brutalized at the hands of other</v>

1788
01:00:16.401 --> 01:00:17.090
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

1789
01:00:17.090 --> 01:00:18.960
<v Speaker 4>It's like that's enough to produce resent,</v>

1790
01:00:18.961 --> 01:00:21.020
<v Speaker 4>but even the people who are doing well,</v>

1791
01:00:21.350 --> 01:00:24.730
<v Speaker 4>but there are people who are not doing so well and they've had pretty damn roof</v>

1792
01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:28.230
<v Speaker 4>lights and may be brutalized the law and their lights and being trashed to</v>

1793
01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:31.670
<v Speaker 4>tragic and they beat betrayed and they get really,</v>

1794
01:00:31.671 --> 01:00:32.390
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>

1795
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:35.710
<v Speaker 4>really bitter about it and not the sort of better that,</v>

1796
01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:36.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1797
01:00:36.110 --> 01:00:40.370
<v Speaker 4>it keeps you up for a night or to be an angry but the kind of bitter that keeps</v>

1798
01:00:40.371 --> 01:00:44.570
<v Speaker 4>you in your mother's basement for like two years doing nothing but fantasizing</v>

1799
01:00:44.571 --> 01:00:46.400
<v Speaker 4>about how you'd like to take for advantage.</v>

1800
01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:51.650
<v Speaker 4>You could give some pretty terrible places with two years of sustained effort</v>

1801
01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:53.090
<v Speaker 4>and there's a reason for it.</v>

1802
01:00:53.091 --> 01:00:54.410
<v Speaker 4>There's a reason driving it.</v>

1803
01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:55.810
<v Speaker 4>You know what the reason is is well,</v>

1804
01:00:56.030 --> 01:00:57.980
<v Speaker 4>in escapable brutality of life,</v>

1805
01:00:58.960 --> 01:00:59.360
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1806
01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:00.021
<v Speaker 4>there's a reason,</v>

1807
01:01:00.021 --> 01:01:04.250
<v Speaker 4>but there's no excuse for it because just because things are terrible doesn't</v>

1808
01:01:04.251 --> 01:01:06.650
<v Speaker 4>mean that you're justified in making them worse.</v>

1809
01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:07.311
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1810
01:01:07.311 --> 01:01:09.260
<v Speaker 4>and that's another central element,</v>

1811
01:01:09.261 --> 01:01:11.770
<v Speaker 4>I would say up the ethic that has to unite us.</v>

1812
01:01:11.790 --> 01:01:12.380
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1813
01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:15.980
<v Speaker 4>you don't have the right to use your tragedy to make the world a worse place.</v>

1814
01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:23.080
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

1815
01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:25.360
<v Speaker 4>say that.</v>

1816
01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:25.990
<v Speaker 4>I say that.</v>

1817
01:01:25.990 --> 01:01:30.580
<v Speaker 4>I don't say that lightly because I know that people can have brutally difficult</v>

1818
01:01:30.581 --> 01:01:32.100
<v Speaker 4>lives and it's,</v>

1819
01:01:32.101 --> 01:01:37.101
<v Speaker 4>some people have lives that are so brutally difficult that it's almost done</v>

1820
01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:38.773
<v Speaker 4>imaginable.</v>

1821
01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:39.970
<v Speaker 4>But some of those people,</v>

1822
01:01:39.971 --> 01:01:41.190
<v Speaker 4>and I've met people like that,</v>

1823
01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:44.830
<v Speaker 4>they've had lives so difficult that you just can't,</v>

1824
01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:46.420
<v Speaker 4>you can hardly imagine it.</v>

1825
01:01:46.750 --> 01:01:47.020
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1826
01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:49.960
<v Speaker 4>almost everything about their life is a catastrophe.</v>

1827
01:01:50.350 --> 01:01:51.240
<v Speaker 4>I met this one woman,</v>

1828
01:01:51.241 --> 01:01:52.870
<v Speaker 4>I won't tell you quick story about her.</v>

1829
01:01:53.410 --> 01:01:54.700
<v Speaker 4>She was an amazing person.</v>

1830
01:01:55.710 --> 01:01:56.740
<v Speaker 4>So she,</v>

1831
01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:01.090
<v Speaker 4>I met her in this outpatient clinic I worked with,</v>

1832
01:02:01.330 --> 01:02:01.961
<v Speaker 4>worked for us,</v>

1833
01:02:01.961 --> 01:02:06.961
<v Speaker 4>the Douglas Hospital at Montreal and the Douglas Hospital as an inpatient</v>

1834
01:02:07.751 --> 01:02:11.070
<v Speaker 4>psychiatric hospital that was building in the mid 20th century.</v>

1835
01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:13.540
<v Speaker 4>It had hundreds and hundreds of inmates at one point,</v>

1836
01:02:13.810 --> 01:02:14.291
<v Speaker 4>patients,</v>

1837
01:02:14.291 --> 01:02:14.920
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

1838
01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:19.450
<v Speaker 4>but they were all basically released in the 60s during deinstitutionalization</v>

1839
01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:21.800
<v Speaker 4>psychiatric drugs started to become popular.</v>

1840
01:02:21.870 --> 01:02:22.670
<v Speaker 4>Some of that was good,</v>

1841
01:02:22.670 --> 01:02:23.810
<v Speaker 4>some of it wasn't so good,</v>

1842
01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:27.870
<v Speaker 4>but there were some patients left at the Douglas Hospital and they were people</v>

1843
01:02:27.871 --> 01:02:30.780
<v Speaker 4>who were so badly damaged that they couldn't be the institutionalized.</v>

1844
01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:34.530
<v Speaker 4>And what you've seen street people and you know how bad the damage they are.</v>

1845
01:02:34.531 --> 01:02:35.820
<v Speaker 4>They at the institutionalized.</v>

1846
01:02:35.821 --> 01:02:40.821
<v Speaker 4>So just imagine for a minute how badly damaged you would have to be to not be</v>

1847
01:02:42.090 --> 01:02:43.710
<v Speaker 4>deinstitutionalized.</v>

1848
01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:46.770
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you've ever seen photographs by Diane Arbus.</v>

1849
01:02:46.771 --> 01:02:49.950
<v Speaker 4>She went across the United States and photograph people who were,</v>

1850
01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:53.970
<v Speaker 4>well there were strange and and hurt people generally speaking.</v>

1851
01:02:53.971 --> 01:02:56.050
<v Speaker 4>And the the,</v>

1852
01:02:56.090 --> 01:02:57.870
<v Speaker 4>the people who were left at the Douglas,</v>

1853
01:02:57.871 --> 01:02:58.350
<v Speaker 4>they were,</v>

1854
01:02:58.350 --> 01:02:59.310
<v Speaker 4>they were like Diane,</v>

1855
01:02:59.370 --> 01:03:02.220
<v Speaker 4>Diane Arbus photographic subjects,</v>

1856
01:03:02.250 --> 01:03:07.250
<v Speaker 4>so hurt and so destroyed by decades of mental illness and they,</v>

1857
01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:10.590
<v Speaker 4>the buildings and the Douglas Hospital.</v>

1858
01:03:10.591 --> 01:03:12.870
<v Speaker 4>We're connected by underground passages,</v>

1859
01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:15.390
<v Speaker 4>partly because it's so bloody cold in Montreal and winter.</v>

1860
01:03:15.391 --> 01:03:17.880
<v Speaker 4>You didn't want everybody freezing to death when they were moving from one</v>

1861
01:03:17.881 --> 01:03:18.714
<v Speaker 4>building to another.</v>

1862
01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:21.750
<v Speaker 4>There are a lot of vending machines and so forth downstairs,</v>

1863
01:03:21.751 --> 01:03:23.880
<v Speaker 4>and that's where the inpatients would congregate.</v>

1864
01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:24.750
<v Speaker 4>And walking through there,</v>

1865
01:03:24.751 --> 01:03:26.850
<v Speaker 4>it was like walking through Dante's inferno,</v>

1866
01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:28.080
<v Speaker 4>like it was a real,</v>

1867
01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:31.060
<v Speaker 4>it was really well as surreal.</v>

1868
01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:32.520
<v Speaker 4>Like there's no other way to put it.</v>

1869
01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:34.800
<v Speaker 4>I took my brother with me once he,</v>

1870
01:03:34.801 --> 01:03:34.890
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1871
01:03:34.890 --> 01:03:36.590
<v Speaker 4>he wasn't accustomed to this sort of thing at all.</v>

1872
01:03:36.591 --> 01:03:37.830
<v Speaker 4>It just shell shocked him,</v>

1873
01:03:37.831 --> 01:03:38.111
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1874
01:03:38.111 --> 01:03:39.090
<v Speaker 4>and no wonder.</v>

1875
01:03:39.091 --> 01:03:41.100
<v Speaker 4>So these people were in very rough shape.</v>

1876
01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:41.521
<v Speaker 4>Anyways,</v>

1877
01:03:41.521 --> 01:03:42.630
<v Speaker 4>this woman came to see me,</v>

1878
01:03:42.631 --> 01:03:46.320
<v Speaker 4>I have to at the outpatient clinic and so she had her problems,</v>

1879
01:03:46.321 --> 01:03:47.154
<v Speaker 4>but she wasn't,</v>

1880
01:03:47.310 --> 01:03:50.580
<v Speaker 4>they weren't severe enough so that she was an institutionalized inpatient,</v>

1881
01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:52.270
<v Speaker 4>but she had her problem with span.</v>

1882
01:03:52.271 --> 01:03:54.330
<v Speaker 4>So she kind of looked like a street person.</v>

1883
01:03:54.331 --> 01:03:57.990
<v Speaker 4>She had this red down jacket on.</v>

1884
01:03:57.991 --> 01:04:01.530
<v Speaker 4>It was really dirty and her clothes were dirty and she wasn't an attractive</v>

1885
01:04:01.531 --> 01:04:01.891
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>

1886
01:04:01.891 --> 01:04:06.891
<v Speaker 4>And she was the young person and she was so shy that like shy doesn't even begin</v>

1887
01:04:08.041 --> 01:04:08.570
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

1888
01:04:08.570 --> 01:04:09.570
<v Speaker 4>to describe it.</v>

1889
01:04:09.570 --> 01:04:11.730
<v Speaker 4>Like she was a whole universe of shy.</v>

1890
01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:15.090
<v Speaker 4>So she would walk up to people like this.</v>

1891
01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:18.270
<v Speaker 4>It was like she couldn't stand the light that was emanating from him.</v>

1892
01:04:18.271 --> 01:04:21.030
<v Speaker 4>She was so shy that that was the best she could do,</v>

1893
01:04:21.090 --> 01:04:21.923
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1894
01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:22.260
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

1895
01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:23.640
<v Speaker 4>to approach someone like this.</v>

1896
01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:24.510
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>

1897
01:04:24.510 --> 01:04:26.790
<v Speaker 4>if she's out on the street approaching people like this,</v>

1898
01:04:26.791 --> 01:04:29.160
<v Speaker 4>it's like she's not getting a positive response,</v>

1899
01:04:29.161 --> 01:04:29.431
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1900
01:04:29.431 --> 01:04:31.710
<v Speaker 4>because people don't know what the hell to make of that.</v>

1901
01:04:31.711 --> 01:04:33.680
<v Speaker 4>Especially because she's also uncapped him,</v>

1902
01:04:34.110 --> 01:04:34.411
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1903
01:04:34.411 --> 01:04:34.621
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1904
01:04:34.621 --> 01:04:37.440
<v Speaker 4>and not very verbal and God.</v>

1905
01:04:37.441 --> 01:04:40.410
<v Speaker 4>So she came to see me and we were trying to fish.</v>

1906
01:04:40.411 --> 01:04:43.320
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't very articulate and she wasn't very bright,</v>

1907
01:04:43.670 --> 01:04:44.503
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1908
01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:45.061
<v Speaker 4>at,</v>

1909
01:04:45.061 --> 01:04:46.530
<v Speaker 4>we're trying to figure out what she wanted.</v>

1910
01:04:46.531 --> 01:04:49.560
<v Speaker 4>And so for a while what I was trying to do is to get her to stand up a bit and</v>

1911
01:04:49.561 --> 01:04:52.590
<v Speaker 4>didn't take her hand away from her face just so that she looked a little bit</v>

1912
01:04:52.591 --> 01:04:55.560
<v Speaker 4>more normal so that she had a better chance of having,</v>

1913
01:04:55.650 --> 01:04:55.951
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1914
01:04:55.951 --> 01:04:57.960
<v Speaker 4>like a reasonable interaction with people.</v>

1915
01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:59.750
<v Speaker 4>But I talked to her for awhile.</v>

1916
01:04:59.910 --> 01:05:01.560
<v Speaker 4>She told me a little bit about her life.</v>

1917
01:05:01.590 --> 01:05:01.831
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1918
01:05:01.831 --> 01:05:02.520
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

1919
01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:02.821
<v Speaker 4>she was,</v>

1920
01:05:02.821 --> 01:05:04.530
<v Speaker 4>I've employed obviously,</v>

1921
01:05:04.531 --> 01:05:05.370
<v Speaker 4>and her,</v>

1922
01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:09.870
<v Speaker 4>she lived with her aunt who was like deathly ill and her and her mom had a</v>

1923
01:05:09.871 --> 01:05:14.250
<v Speaker 4>boyfriend who was a violent schizophrenia who was an alcoholic and all he ever</v>

1924
01:05:14.251 --> 01:05:18.520
<v Speaker 4>did was like harass her about her being in league with Satan,</v>

1925
01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:21.460
<v Speaker 4>which was just what you need when you have all of those other problems.</v>

1926
01:05:21.461 --> 01:05:21.761
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1927
01:05:21.761 --> 01:05:22.780
<v Speaker 4>Because you know,</v>

1928
01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:24.393
<v Speaker 4>anyways,</v>

1929
01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:25.540
<v Speaker 4>it was like,</v>

1930
01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:26.470
<v Speaker 4>you just listen to this.</v>

1931
01:05:26.471 --> 01:05:27.041
<v Speaker 4>He's just like,</v>

1932
01:05:27.041 --> 01:05:28.000
<v Speaker 4>Oh God.</v>

1933
01:05:28.270 --> 01:05:28.541
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1934
01:05:28.541 --> 01:05:30.490
<v Speaker 4>could this possibly be any worse?</v>

1935
01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:31.960
<v Speaker 4>And the answer is yes.</v>

1936
01:05:32.590 --> 01:05:34.670
<v Speaker 4>It could be good to be worse even.</v>

1937
01:05:35.110 --> 01:05:35.720
<v Speaker 4>But once,</v>

1938
01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:36.820
<v Speaker 4>here's what she wanted.</v>

1939
01:05:36.821 --> 01:05:37.631
<v Speaker 4>This is the thing.</v>

1940
01:05:37.631 --> 01:05:38.170
<v Speaker 4>When went to,</v>

1941
01:05:38.170 --> 01:05:39.070
<v Speaker 4>after I talked to her,</v>

1942
01:05:39.071 --> 01:05:40.590
<v Speaker 4>like for five or six sessions,</v>

1943
01:05:40.591 --> 01:05:44.170
<v Speaker 4>it turned out she didn't even come to the damn behavior therapy clinic to get</v>

1944
01:05:44.171 --> 01:05:45.004
<v Speaker 4>help.</v>

1945
01:05:45.370 --> 01:05:46.590
<v Speaker 4>She didn't want hell.</v>

1946
01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:50.020
<v Speaker 4>She had this dog and she used to walk the dog around.</v>

1947
01:05:51.470 --> 01:05:56.280
<v Speaker 4>She liked the dog and she had been in the inpatient ward from time to time</v>

1948
01:05:56.281 --> 01:05:57.980
<v Speaker 4>because he's been committed to the hospital,</v>

1949
01:05:57.981 --> 01:05:58.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1950
01:05:58.550 --> 01:06:00.540
<v Speaker 4>but then she went to the inpatient ward.</v>

1951
01:06:00.541 --> 01:06:04.250
<v Speaker 4>She saw all these other people who were worse off than her.</v>

1952
01:06:04.310 --> 01:06:05.270
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to imagine,</v>

1953
01:06:06.750 --> 01:06:07.760
<v Speaker 4>but that's what she saw.</v>

1954
01:06:07.761 --> 01:06:10.790
<v Speaker 4>She saw these people that were worse off than her and what she wanted.</v>

1955
01:06:10.791 --> 01:06:14.660
<v Speaker 4>She was trying to find somebody who is an administrator at the hospital that</v>

1956
01:06:14.661 --> 01:06:19.640
<v Speaker 4>would give her permission to take one of the inpatients out for a walk when she</v>

1957
01:06:19.641 --> 01:06:23.120
<v Speaker 4>wake to walk her dog and that one was her.</v>

1958
01:06:23.210 --> 01:06:23.960
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1959
01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:24.793
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

1960
01:06:27.170 --> 01:06:27.700
<v Speaker 1>no right.</v>

1961
01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:28.533
<v Speaker 1>Telling you.</v>

1962
01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:31.120
<v Speaker 4>When she told me that story,</v>

1963
01:06:31.121 --> 01:06:31.391
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1964
01:06:31.391 --> 01:06:34.720
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the hell you think of someone like that because you know she</v>

1965
01:06:34.721 --> 01:06:36.070
<v Speaker 4>was so rude.</v>

1966
01:06:36.071 --> 01:06:39.640
<v Speaker 4>Did her presentation and she could see,</v>

1967
01:06:39.730 --> 01:06:42.400
<v Speaker 4>she could see outside her own misery.</v>

1968
01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:44.620
<v Speaker 4>And as intense as it was,</v>

1969
01:06:45.070 --> 01:06:46.600
<v Speaker 4>she could see outside their own misery.</v>

1970
01:06:46.601 --> 01:06:47.830
<v Speaker 4>And her decision was,</v>

1971
01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:48.640
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1972
01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:52.360
<v Speaker 4>maybe there's a way that I could make something a little bit better for someone</v>

1973
01:06:52.361 --> 01:06:53.260
<v Speaker 4>worse off than me.</v>

1974
01:06:53.530 --> 01:06:54.363
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1975
01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:55.343
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1976
01:06:55.990 --> 01:06:57.160
<v Speaker 4>I never forgot her.</v>

1977
01:06:57.220 --> 01:06:58.260
<v Speaker 4>I'll never forget her.</v>

1978
01:06:58.570 --> 01:07:00.880
<v Speaker 4>She just absolutely blew me away.</v>

1979
01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:01.983
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1980
01:07:04.650 --> 01:07:05.483
<v Speaker 1>what</v>

1981
01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:07.090
<v Speaker 1>is it?</v>

1982
01:07:07.090 --> 01:07:08.220
<v Speaker 1>The bigger person,</v>

1983
01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:09.430
<v Speaker 1>she wasn't</v>

1984
01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:12.060
<v Speaker 4>the bitter person by any stretch of the imagination.</v>

1985
01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:13.411
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1986
01:07:13.411 --> 01:07:13.591
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1987
01:07:13.591 --> 01:07:14.840
<v Speaker 4>so back to hierarchies.</v>

1988
01:07:14.850 --> 01:07:15.150
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1989
01:07:15.150 --> 01:07:17.760
<v Speaker 4>there's lots of ways that you can be successful in a hierarchy,</v>

1990
01:07:17.761 --> 01:07:18.031
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1991
01:07:18.031 --> 01:07:19.620
<v Speaker 4>and she was asked to clean successful.</v>

1992
01:07:19.621 --> 01:07:20.161
<v Speaker 4>I would say it,</v>

1993
01:07:20.161 --> 01:07:20.881
<v Speaker 4>that's for sure.</v>

1994
01:07:20.881 --> 01:07:21.900
<v Speaker 4>And that's really something.</v>

1995
01:07:21.901 --> 01:07:23.700
<v Speaker 4>And she didn't let her own suffering.</v>

1996
01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:24.890
<v Speaker 4>Dominique,</v>

1997
01:07:24.890 --> 01:07:27.090
<v Speaker 4>her psychological reality and,</v>

1998
01:07:27.310 --> 01:07:32.310
<v Speaker 4>and determined that the best move forward was to extract revenge on the world.</v>

1999
01:07:32.690 --> 01:07:32.971
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>

2000
01:07:32.971 --> 01:07:34.540
<v Speaker 4>She decided to play a straight game.</v>

2001
01:07:34.541 --> 01:07:35.430
<v Speaker 4>So there was something,</v>

2002
01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:35.851
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2003
01:07:35.851 --> 01:07:38.310
<v Speaker 4>I hesitate to say st like about her,</v>

2004
01:07:38.311 --> 01:07:39.270
<v Speaker 4>but good God.</v>

2005
01:07:39.271 --> 01:07:39.751
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

2006
01:07:39.751 --> 01:07:44.751
<v Speaker 4>She had everything you could possibly imagine not going for her and still like</v>

2007
01:07:44.841 --> 01:07:45.960
<v Speaker 4>how do you manage that?</v>

2008
01:07:45.961 --> 01:07:46.261
<v Speaker 4>How do you,</v>

2009
01:07:46.261 --> 01:07:46.940
<v Speaker 4>how well you,</v>

2010
01:07:46.940 --> 01:07:48.600
<v Speaker 4>as far as I could tell when he decide,</v>

2011
01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:50.100
<v Speaker 4>like it's not that simple,</v>

2012
01:07:50.101 --> 01:07:50.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2013
01:07:50.610 --> 01:07:53.490
<v Speaker 4>but there's an element of decision that goes into that.</v>

2014
01:07:53.790 --> 01:07:56.820
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's a thousand decisions or 100,000 decisions,</v>

2015
01:07:56.821 --> 01:07:57.041
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2016
01:07:57.041 --> 01:08:01.530
<v Speaker 4>a little tiny micro decisions that enables someone to stay on the right side of</v>

2017
01:08:01.531 --> 01:08:04.200
<v Speaker 4>reality even though so many things are stacked up against them.</v>

2018
01:08:05.950 --> 01:08:06.550
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2019
01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:08.020
<v Speaker 4>so she wasn't bitter.</v>

2020
01:08:08.170 --> 01:08:08.560
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

2021
01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:10.720
<v Speaker 4>well back to the hierarchy or idea.</v>

2022
01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:12.040
<v Speaker 1>Well</v>

2023
01:08:14.250 --> 01:08:15.083
<v Speaker 4>life is full of,</v>

2024
01:08:15.770 --> 01:08:16.100
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2025
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:17.450
<v Speaker 1>We've already established that.</v>

2026
01:08:17.530 --> 01:08:19.100
<v Speaker 1>And the question is what do you have to,</v>

2027
01:08:19.340 --> 01:08:20.780
<v Speaker 1>to set against that?</v>

2028
01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:24.800
<v Speaker 1>What do you have to set against that is actually what hierarchies provide for</v>

2029
01:08:24.801 --> 01:08:25.370
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

2030
01:08:25.370 --> 01:08:29.840
<v Speaker 1>So because you can't set happiness against tragedy,</v>

2031
01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:32.840
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't work because you're not happy when there's a tragedy.</v>

2032
01:08:32.841 --> 01:08:34.420
<v Speaker 1>And so that just doesn't work right?</v>

2033
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.680
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to be happy all that often.</v>

2034
01:08:36.681 --> 01:08:39.710
<v Speaker 1>And when it come to like that's really good and all of that and you should enjoy</v>

2035
01:08:39.711 --> 01:08:41.000
<v Speaker 1>it and thank God for it.</v>

2036
01:08:41.001 --> 01:08:41.661
<v Speaker 1>And all of that,</v>

2037
01:08:41.661 --> 01:08:45.930
<v Speaker 1>but you can't use it as a has a boat in a storm.</v>

2038
01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:47.180
<v Speaker 1>Like that's not happening.</v>

2039
01:08:47.270 --> 01:08:48.560
<v Speaker 1>You got to have something else.</v>

2040
01:08:49.190 --> 01:08:50.023
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2041
01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:53.550
<v Speaker 1>the thing about a hierarchy of value hierarchy because it will hierarchies,</v>

2042
01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:54.890
<v Speaker 1>value hierarchies.</v>

2043
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:57.970
<v Speaker 1>Something at the top is better and something at the board of his worst.</v>

2044
01:08:57.980 --> 01:08:59.090
<v Speaker 1>That's really what defines her.</v>

2045
01:08:59.090 --> 01:09:03.940
<v Speaker 1>Her key is having a hierarchy gives you a name I'm giving you.</v>

2046
01:09:03.941 --> 01:09:04.611
<v Speaker 1>They give you name.</v>

2047
01:09:04.611 --> 01:09:06.710
<v Speaker 1>It gives you a purpose and like we know this,</v>

2048
01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:09.050
<v Speaker 1>even we know this neuro biologically,</v>

2049
01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:09.913
<v Speaker 1>let's say</v>

2050
01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:13.730
<v Speaker 1>if the baseline condition of life is suffering,</v>

2051
01:09:14.450 --> 01:09:18.560
<v Speaker 1>you have to have something to offset it and what do you have to offset it is</v>

2052
01:09:18.561 --> 01:09:22.970
<v Speaker 1>whatever value I hierarchy offers you because you need something to aim at.</v>

2053
01:09:23.270 --> 01:09:26.750
<v Speaker 1>You need something to a map that makes the suffering worthwhile.</v>

2054
01:09:27.150 --> 01:09:27.983
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>

2055
01:09:28.070 --> 01:09:29.390
<v Speaker 1>that's like the meaning of life.</v>

2056
01:09:29.391 --> 01:09:29.661
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

2057
01:09:29.661 --> 01:09:29.841
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2058
01:09:29.841 --> 01:09:30.740
<v Speaker 1>what's the meaning of life?</v>

2059
01:09:30.741 --> 01:09:33.840
<v Speaker 1>It's to have something to end up that makes the suffering worthwhile so that you</v>

2060
01:09:33.841 --> 01:09:34.460
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>

2061
01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:37.070
<v Speaker 1>when you're in the midst of your limited life,</v>

2062
01:09:37.071 --> 01:09:37.904
<v Speaker 1>you could say,</v>

2063
01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:38.481
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2064
01:09:38.481 --> 01:09:38.951
<v Speaker 1>but this,</v>

2065
01:09:38.951 --> 01:09:40.340
<v Speaker 1>this is worthwhile.</v>

2066
01:09:40.490 --> 01:09:41.420
<v Speaker 1>This makes it worthwhile.</v>

2067
01:09:41.421 --> 01:09:43.170
<v Speaker 1>And it's not something that you think exactly.</v>

2068
01:09:43.171 --> 01:09:44.480
<v Speaker 1>It's something you've noticed,</v>

2069
01:09:44.900 --> 01:09:45.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2070
01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:45.391
<v Speaker 1>Cause you,</v>

2071
01:09:45.391 --> 01:09:49.490
<v Speaker 1>you can watch your life for a couple of weeks detached have,</v>

2072
01:09:49.491 --> 01:09:50.510
<v Speaker 1>you can watch and you can,</v>

2073
01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:51.380
<v Speaker 1>you can ask yourself,</v>

2074
01:09:51.381 --> 01:09:52.214
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2075
01:09:52.310 --> 01:09:53.240
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

2076
01:09:53.270 --> 01:09:54.860
<v Speaker 1>where is it that I am,</v>

2077
01:09:54.861 --> 01:09:57.530
<v Speaker 1>when I'm doing something that justifies itself?</v>

2078
01:09:57.980 --> 01:09:59.240
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's playing music.</v>

2079
01:09:59.510 --> 01:10:01.640
<v Speaker 1>That's often the case for people that are listening to music.</v>

2080
01:10:01.641 --> 01:10:04.610
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe you're with someone you love or maybe you're working on something that</v>

2081
01:10:04.611 --> 01:10:05.690
<v Speaker 1>you're really engaged in.</v>

2082
01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:06.221
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2083
01:10:06.221 --> 01:10:07.580
<v Speaker 1>What would it be different for different people?</v>

2084
01:10:07.581 --> 01:10:09.290
<v Speaker 1>But you can be sure that you're having,</v>

2085
01:10:09.291 --> 01:10:12.680
<v Speaker 1>if something worthwhile and you're on the pathway to managing it.</v>

2086
01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:14.450
<v Speaker 1>And that's the thing about human beings.</v>

2087
01:10:14.451 --> 01:10:17.150
<v Speaker 1>That's where we get our positive emotion is we,</v>

2088
01:10:17.210 --> 01:10:20.640
<v Speaker 1>we aim at something the time and then we moved towards it.</v>

2089
01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:23.210
<v Speaker 1>And if we see ourselves successfully moving towards it,</v>

2090
01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:26.690
<v Speaker 1>then that engages us with the meeting that makes life worthwhile.</v>

2091
01:10:26.780 --> 01:10:31.250
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that if you don't have a hierarchy of value and you don't</v>

2092
01:10:31.251 --> 01:10:32.270
<v Speaker 1>have anything to aim for,</v>

2093
01:10:32.330 --> 01:10:34.280
<v Speaker 1>then all you're left with is stupid suffering.</v>

2094
01:10:34.820 --> 01:10:35.740
<v Speaker 1>Because like,</v>

2095
01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:37.570
<v Speaker 1>that's not eradicable right.</v>

2096
01:10:37.610 --> 01:10:41.510
<v Speaker 1>There's no way of getting rid of that quality be down.</v>

2097
01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:45.650
<v Speaker 1>Like if everyone had everything and we were all the same,</v>

2098
01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:45.881
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

2099
01:10:45.881 --> 01:10:49.190
<v Speaker 1>We'd still be suffering with the burden of being human and being alive,</v>

2100
01:10:49.250 --> 01:10:53.150
<v Speaker 1>that you're not getting rid of that the only thing you could do without is</v>

2101
01:10:53.210 --> 01:10:54.260
<v Speaker 1>justify it.</v>

2102
01:10:54.980 --> 01:10:59.980
<v Speaker 1>And the only way you can justify something that's that terrible is to be</v>

2103
01:10:59.991 --> 01:11:03.710
<v Speaker 1>pursuing something that's good enough to make that justifiable.</v>

2104
01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:04.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2105
01:11:04.190 --> 01:11:05.360
<v Speaker 1>who knows what that will be.</v>

2106
01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:10.740
<v Speaker 1>I learned that partly,</v>

2107
01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:11.910
<v Speaker 1>strangely enough,</v>

2108
01:11:11.910 --> 01:11:13.740
<v Speaker 4>I learned that partly from watching Pinocchio,</v>

2109
01:11:13.741 --> 01:11:15.270
<v Speaker 4>which I spent a lot of time watching.</v>

2110
01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:18.420
<v Speaker 4>I have a Youtube Video About Pinocchio,</v>

2111
01:11:18.421 --> 01:11:21.660
<v Speaker 4>and there's a scene in Tokyo where it was a very strange story,</v>

2112
01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:24.960
<v Speaker 4>and it's full of Biblical allegories and deep myths and all sorts of things,</v>

2113
01:11:24.961 --> 01:11:25.900
<v Speaker 4>but there's a scene in,</v>

2114
01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:27.170
<v Speaker 4>but Akio where'd you,</v>

2115
01:11:27.171 --> 01:11:30.060
<v Speaker 4>Japan lifts his eye up and wishes on a star.</v>

2116
01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:30.600
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2117
01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:34.200
<v Speaker 4>any wishes that his puppet would become a genuine human being?</v>

2118
01:11:34.370 --> 01:11:35.820
<v Speaker 4>And that's a very deep idea.</v>

2119
01:11:35.850 --> 01:11:40.440
<v Speaker 4>But the whole way that's acted out is extraordinarily telling because a star</v>

2120
01:11:40.620 --> 01:11:42.980
<v Speaker 4>think a star or something that glitters in the darkness,</v>

2121
01:11:42.990 --> 01:11:43.580
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2122
01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:47.280
<v Speaker 4>It and it's part of the cosmos is part of the eternal cosmic structure,</v>

2123
01:11:47.281 --> 01:11:48.990
<v Speaker 4>which you sense when you look up,</v>

2124
01:11:48.991 --> 01:11:49.350
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2125
01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:53.940
<v Speaker 4>Everyone who looks into the night sky has a sense of awe associated with</v>

2126
01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.170
<v Speaker 4>confronting the infinite,</v>

2127
01:11:55.171 --> 01:11:56.670
<v Speaker 4>let's say something like that.</v>

2128
01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:59.430
<v Speaker 4>So it started something that partakes of the infinite and it's,</v>

2129
01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:00.990
<v Speaker 4>it's above the horizon,</v>

2130
01:12:01.490 --> 01:12:01.681
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2131
01:12:01.681 --> 01:12:03.360
<v Speaker 4>So it's something you lift your eyes too.</v>

2132
01:12:03.361 --> 01:12:04.800
<v Speaker 4>So it's a high aim.</v>

2133
01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:07.830
<v Speaker 4>And so what [inaudible] does is take as the highest aim,</v>

2134
01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:08.933
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2135
01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:13.890
<v Speaker 4>the hope that the puppet that he's created could become genuine.</v>

2136
01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:17.010
<v Speaker 4>And there's something about that that's extraordinarily deep.</v>

2137
01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:18.690
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's the hope you have for a child,</v>

2138
01:12:18.691 --> 01:12:19.770
<v Speaker 4>if you have any sense,</v>

2139
01:12:19.771 --> 01:12:23.790
<v Speaker 4>is that the person grows up to become an autonomous and fully functioning,</v>

2140
01:12:23.791 --> 01:12:24.660
<v Speaker 4>responsible,</v>

2141
01:12:24.661 --> 01:12:25.111
<v Speaker 4>awake,</v>

2142
01:12:25.111 --> 01:12:25.531
<v Speaker 4>aware,</v>

2143
01:12:25.531 --> 01:12:26.780
<v Speaker 4>conscious human being.</v>

2144
01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:31.200
<v Speaker 4>Not The puppet of some idiot belief system or the puppet of any person,</v>

2145
01:12:31.201 --> 01:12:36.000
<v Speaker 4>but someone who who's admirable and competent and truthful,</v>

2146
01:12:36.030 --> 01:12:36.930
<v Speaker 4>all of those things,</v>

2147
01:12:36.931 --> 01:12:38.040
<v Speaker 4>that's a high aim.</v>

2148
01:12:38.310 --> 01:12:38.491
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2149
01:12:38.491 --> 01:12:40.740
<v Speaker 4>that's an aim that maybe would justify your life,</v>

2150
01:12:40.770 --> 01:12:41.101
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

2151
01:12:41.101 --> 01:12:41.640
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2152
01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:42.960
<v Speaker 4>in the face of your suffering,</v>

2153
01:12:42.961 --> 01:12:45.000
<v Speaker 4>you have this terrible cross to bear him and say,</v>

2154
01:12:45.001 --> 01:12:45.300
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2155
01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:49.020
<v Speaker 4>who the hell could you be in the face of all that?</v>

2156
01:12:49.050 --> 01:12:52.290
<v Speaker 4>You could be something strong enough to bear it and hopefully that'd be</v>

2157
01:12:52.291 --> 01:12:52.890
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

2158
01:12:52.890 --> 01:12:54.780
<v Speaker 4>Who would you be if you were that person?</v>

2159
01:12:55.290 --> 01:12:57.330
<v Speaker 4>God only knows it's really,</v>

2160
01:12:57.331 --> 01:12:59.310
<v Speaker 4>it's a task fit for a cake.</v>

2161
01:12:59.370 --> 01:13:01.080
<v Speaker 4>It really is because it's so,</v>

2162
01:13:01.230 --> 01:13:02.980
<v Speaker 4>it's such an impossible thing to,</v>

2163
01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:05.220
<v Speaker 4>to imagine yourself managing,</v>

2164
01:13:06.150 --> 01:13:07.270
<v Speaker 4>but yet here we are.</v>

2165
01:13:07.310 --> 01:13:07.531
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2166
01:13:07.531 --> 01:13:08.040
<v Speaker 4>and that's,</v>

2167
01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:10.530
<v Speaker 4>and that's what's in front of us as our calling.</v>

2168
01:13:10.950 --> 01:13:12.540
<v Speaker 4>It's right in front of us.</v>

2169
01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:14.011
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2170
01:13:14.011 --> 01:13:16.380
<v Speaker 4>you need a hierarchy because you need something to,</v>

2171
01:13:16.381 --> 01:13:16.770
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>

2172
01:13:16.770 --> 01:13:19.020
<v Speaker 4>you need something to aim out to justify your life.</v>

2173
01:13:19.050 --> 01:13:19.381
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2174
01:13:19.381 --> 01:13:19.680
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2175
01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:23.040
<v Speaker 4>the problem with the hierarchy is that what maybe other people will attain more</v>

2176
01:13:23.041 --> 01:13:24.840
<v Speaker 4>than you and you get bitter and resentful.</v>

2177
01:13:24.841 --> 01:13:25.141
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2178
01:13:25.141 --> 01:13:25.620
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2179
01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:29.400
<v Speaker 4>there's a way around that and this maybe this is a way around resentment,</v>

2180
01:13:29.401 --> 01:13:30.240
<v Speaker 4>which is a very,</v>

2181
01:13:30.241 --> 01:13:30.990
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>

2182
01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:32.560
<v Speaker 4>very toxic emotion.</v>

2183
01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:33.413
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2184
01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:34.553
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2185
01:13:34.650 --> 01:13:35.131
<v Speaker 4>if you want,</v>

2186
01:13:35.131 --> 01:13:35.641
<v Speaker 4>we all send,</v>

2187
01:13:35.641 --> 01:13:38.220
<v Speaker 4>there's going to be people Richard than you and you're going to be annoyed about</v>

2188
01:13:38.221 --> 01:13:38.460
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2189
01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:39.300
<v Speaker 4>And if you want fame,</v>

2190
01:13:39.301 --> 01:13:40.380
<v Speaker 4>the same thing applies.</v>

2191
01:13:40.381 --> 01:13:44.910
<v Speaker 4>And then track if there's any unit dimensional system of values is going to put</v>

2192
01:13:44.911 --> 01:13:46.890
<v Speaker 4>you in a position where you're likely inferior.</v>

2193
01:13:46.950 --> 01:13:47.400
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

2194
01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:50.010
<v Speaker 4>And even if you manage to Max out on one dimension,</v>

2195
01:13:50.190 --> 01:13:51.360
<v Speaker 4>maybe you're wealthy of it,</v>

2196
01:13:51.361 --> 01:13:53.310
<v Speaker 4>you're still old and fat and bald.</v>

2197
01:13:53.370 --> 01:13:55.980
<v Speaker 4>It's like good luck fixing that with your wealth.</v>

2198
01:13:55.981 --> 01:13:56.550
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2199
01:13:56.550 --> 01:14:01.110
<v Speaker 4>you might be a little nip and tuck will help but still isn't going to make you</v>

2200
01:14:01.111 --> 01:14:01.830
<v Speaker 4>younger.</v>

2201
01:14:01.830 --> 01:14:03.300
<v Speaker 4>So you're stuck with,</v>

2202
01:14:03.570 --> 01:14:07.200
<v Speaker 4>the problem with erecting the hierarchy is it produces the potential for</v>

2203
01:14:07.201 --> 01:14:08.034
<v Speaker 4>resentment,</v>

2204
01:14:08.070 --> 01:14:09.180
<v Speaker 4>but you need the hierarchy.</v>

2205
01:14:09.210 --> 01:14:09.511
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2206
01:14:09.511 --> 01:14:09.721
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2207
01:14:09.721 --> 01:14:11.040
<v Speaker 4>so how do you deal with that?</v>

2208
01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:11.381
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2209
01:14:11.381 --> 01:14:12.214
<v Speaker 4>well</v>

2210
01:14:13.330 --> 01:14:16.570
<v Speaker 4>maybe you're not supposed to be comparing yourself to other people and there's</v>

2211
01:14:16.571 --> 01:14:17.770
<v Speaker 4>real reason not to,</v>

2212
01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:18.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2213
01:14:18.430 --> 01:14:19.420
<v Speaker 4>there really is.</v>

2214
01:14:19.570 --> 01:14:22.720
<v Speaker 4>Maybe when you're 60 you can compare yourself to other 16 year olds,</v>

2215
01:14:22.721 --> 01:14:22.901
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2216
01:14:22.901 --> 01:14:26.200
<v Speaker 4>but by the time you're like 30 you might as well just give it up.</v>

2217
01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:28.000
<v Speaker 4>Because you're a strange,</v>

2218
01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:32.820
<v Speaker 4>when you're 30 you're like you're this thing that no one else is really like</v>

2219
01:14:33.790 --> 01:14:35.580
<v Speaker 4>every other 30 year old is like that tailored.</v>

2220
01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:38.380
<v Speaker 4>So like what are you doing comparing yourself to those other people because</v>

2221
01:14:38.530 --> 01:14:40.030
<v Speaker 4>they're really not light to you.</v>

2222
01:14:40.150 --> 01:14:40.371
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

2223
01:14:40.371 --> 01:14:40.811
<v Speaker 4>I mean it did.</v>

2224
01:14:40.811 --> 01:14:44.380
<v Speaker 4>I didn't notice this 30 is when it really seems to kick in because he gives so</v>

2225
01:14:44.381 --> 01:14:47.260
<v Speaker 4>particular in your genetics,</v>

2226
01:14:47.261 --> 01:14:48.220
<v Speaker 4>your biology,</v>

2227
01:14:48.221 --> 01:14:49.060
<v Speaker 4>your history,</v>

2228
01:14:49.061 --> 01:14:49.990
<v Speaker 4>your education,</v>

2229
01:14:49.991 --> 01:14:51.220
<v Speaker 4>your proclivities,</v>

2230
01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:52.330
<v Speaker 4>your experience,</v>

2231
01:14:52.331 --> 01:14:52.811
<v Speaker 4>all of that,</v>

2232
01:14:52.811 --> 01:14:57.180
<v Speaker 4>it makes you a very unique thing and multidimensionally unique thing.</v>

2233
01:14:57.310 --> 01:14:59.500
<v Speaker 4>How the hell are you going to compare that to someone else?</v>

2234
01:14:59.770 --> 01:15:02.260
<v Speaker 4>Pick one dimension and then fall short.</v>

2235
01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:03.670
<v Speaker 4>Well that's not very bright.</v>

2236
01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:04.821
<v Speaker 4>Like it's just fluff.</v>

2237
01:15:04.821 --> 01:15:05.381
<v Speaker 4>Seriously.</v>

2238
01:15:05.381 --> 01:15:07.780
<v Speaker 4>It's not a very sophisticated cognitive act,</v>

2239
01:15:08.230 --> 01:15:09.010
<v Speaker 4>but you need,</v>

2240
01:15:09.010 --> 01:15:13.150
<v Speaker 4>you still need to see that there's a better and you need to strive towards it.</v>

2241
01:15:13.150 --> 01:15:15.360
<v Speaker 4>So you can always use yourself as the hallmark.</v>

2242
01:15:15.370 --> 01:15:17.500
<v Speaker 4>It's like you kind of have some sense as these are,</v>

2243
01:15:17.950 --> 01:15:22.330
<v Speaker 4>as we've already discussed about how useless and worthless you fundamentally</v>

2244
01:15:22.331 --> 01:15:23.140
<v Speaker 4>are.</v>

2245
01:15:23.140 --> 01:15:24.700
<v Speaker 4>You can use that as the hallmark.</v>

2246
01:15:24.750 --> 01:15:27.730
<v Speaker 4>It's like it is possible to and what do this in my,</v>

2247
01:15:27.820 --> 01:15:29.980
<v Speaker 4>my behavior therapy practice all the time,</v>

2248
01:15:29.981 --> 01:15:34.981
<v Speaker 4>it's like you can probably make tomorrow like one 10th of maybe 100th of a</v>

2249
01:15:35.261 --> 01:15:36.970
<v Speaker 4>percent better than today.</v>

2250
01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:38.560
<v Speaker 4>You could probably do that.</v>

2251
01:15:38.561 --> 01:15:40.660
<v Speaker 4>There's some thing you could do,</v>

2252
01:15:40.780 --> 01:15:42.820
<v Speaker 4>minor thing and I mean you should aim low.</v>

2253
01:15:43.090 --> 01:15:45.400
<v Speaker 4>You really should because then you're likely to do it.</v>

2254
01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:49.480
<v Speaker 4>There's something you could aim at that's kind of low that you probably do that</v>

2255
01:15:49.481 --> 01:15:53.140
<v Speaker 4>would make your life a tiny bit better and so you'd be a better version of</v>

2256
01:15:53.141 --> 01:15:54.040
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>

2257
01:15:54.490 --> 01:15:57.790
<v Speaker 4>But what's so cool about that is that you don't have to do that for very long</v>

2258
01:15:57.791 --> 01:15:58.601
<v Speaker 4>before you get,</v>

2259
01:15:58.601 --> 01:16:00.820
<v Speaker 4>you start hitting the exponential gains.</v>

2260
01:16:00.970 --> 01:16:03.310
<v Speaker 4>That's part of that inequality distribution.</v>

2261
01:16:03.311 --> 01:16:03.910
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2262
01:16:03.910 --> 01:16:06.600
<v Speaker 4>there's this idea inequalities.</v>

2263
01:16:06.670 --> 01:16:07.503
<v Speaker 4>The funny thing,</v>

2264
01:16:07.510 --> 01:16:09.010
<v Speaker 4>we talked about it already that you know,</v>

2265
01:16:09.011 --> 01:16:12.550
<v Speaker 4>a tiny percentage of people tend to take everything in every game.</v>

2266
01:16:13.210 --> 01:16:14.470
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter what the game is,</v>

2267
01:16:14.471 --> 01:16:15.100
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

2268
01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:16.810
<v Speaker 4>it happens in pretty much every game.</v>

2269
01:16:17.470 --> 01:16:20.590
<v Speaker 4>But the way that that starts happening to you is by making incremental</v>

2270
01:16:20.591 --> 01:16:21.610
<v Speaker 4>improvements.</v>

2271
01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:24.850
<v Speaker 4>Cause if you're a little better tomorrow than you are today,</v>

2272
01:16:25.180 --> 01:16:28.840
<v Speaker 4>then the probability that you'll be able to be even a little bit better the day</v>

2273
01:16:28.841 --> 01:16:33.841
<v Speaker 4>after that has increased rather than decreasing because we as you are right now,</v>

2274
01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:36.220
<v Speaker 4>you able to make yourself a little stronger.</v>

2275
01:16:36.910 --> 01:16:37.180
<v Speaker 4>Also,</v>

2276
01:16:37.180 --> 01:16:38.140
<v Speaker 4>let's say you do that,</v>

2277
01:16:38.170 --> 01:16:38.890
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

2278
01:16:38.890 --> 01:16:40.630
<v Speaker 4>and you can try this as an experiment.</v>

2279
01:16:40.631 --> 01:16:41.500
<v Speaker 4>This really works.</v>

2280
01:16:41.501 --> 01:16:41.891
<v Speaker 4>He can say,</v>

2281
01:16:41.891 --> 01:16:42.191
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2282
01:16:42.191 --> 01:16:45.760
<v Speaker 4>well every day for the next year I'm going to try and make one thing slightly</v>

2283
01:16:45.761 --> 01:16:47.380
<v Speaker 4>better and it has to be,</v>

2284
01:16:47.381 --> 01:16:49.900
<v Speaker 4>you gotta be humble about this cause like you're useless.</v>

2285
01:16:49.900 --> 01:16:51.490
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to go to the gym three times a week.</v>

2286
01:16:51.491 --> 01:16:51.750
<v Speaker 4>Frankly.</v>

2287
01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:53.620
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to stop eating like bought bonds.</v>

2288
01:16:53.950 --> 01:16:56.590
<v Speaker 4>You've tried that a hundred times that you've always failed,</v>

2289
01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:58.360
<v Speaker 4>so a lower,</v>

2290
01:16:58.810 --> 01:17:03.810
<v Speaker 4>a lower aim so low that there's a good probability that you'll do it,</v>

2291
01:17:04.450 --> 01:17:06.520
<v Speaker 4>which is what you do if you're encouraging a child,</v>

2292
01:17:06.521 --> 01:17:07.120
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2293
01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:09.130
<v Speaker 4>You said you try to pick a target that,</v>

2294
01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:13.400
<v Speaker 4>not that it's so easy that it's contemptible because what good is that but</v>

2295
01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:18.470
<v Speaker 4>difficult enough to make a difference but likely enough so that you'll do it.</v>

2296
01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:20.360
<v Speaker 4>That's what a good behavioral psychologist does.</v>

2297
01:17:20.361 --> 01:17:21.200
<v Speaker 4>It's like try that,</v>

2298
01:17:21.201 --> 01:17:22.160
<v Speaker 4>try that for a year.</v>

2299
01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:27.800
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to take myself as a baseline and I'm going to look at things that</v>

2300
01:17:27.801 --> 01:17:28.670
<v Speaker 4>I could improve,</v>

2301
01:17:28.671 --> 01:17:32.240
<v Speaker 4>that I would improve and then I'm going to do the small things.</v>

2302
01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:35.590
<v Speaker 4>And so that's where humility comes into it too.</v>

2303
01:17:35.590 --> 01:17:38.990
<v Speaker 4>Because the cap be grandiose things they might not even be something you'd ever</v>

2304
01:17:38.991 --> 01:17:41.450
<v Speaker 4>talked to anyone else about cause they're so trivial.</v>

2305
01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:44.630
<v Speaker 4>But something that you do every day is not trivial.</v>

2306
01:17:45.470 --> 01:17:46.310
<v Speaker 4>Something you repeat,</v>

2307
01:17:46.311 --> 01:17:47.091
<v Speaker 4>that's your life,</v>

2308
01:17:47.091 --> 01:17:47.720
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2309
01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:49.250
<v Speaker 4>Things you do every day,</v>

2310
01:17:49.290 --> 01:17:50.270
<v Speaker 4>that's your life.</v>

2311
01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:51.733
<v Speaker 4>And so if you,</v>

2312
01:17:51.770 --> 01:17:53.930
<v Speaker 4>if you institute that program,</v>

2313
01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:54.171
<v Speaker 4>take,</v>

2314
01:17:54.171 --> 01:17:54.471
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2315
01:17:54.471 --> 01:17:57.800
<v Speaker 4>well just how far could I get if I did that for a year,</v>

2316
01:17:58.310 --> 01:17:59.020
<v Speaker 4>find out,</v>

2317
01:17:59.020 --> 01:17:59.170
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

2318
01:17:59.170 --> 01:18:01.850
<v Speaker 4>I'll do it for a month and see how far you could get.</v>

2319
01:18:01.851 --> 01:18:02.061
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2320
01:18:02.061 --> 01:18:05.600
<v Speaker 4>and I've got 50,000 letters since August,</v>

2321
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:06.650
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>

2322
01:18:06.651 --> 01:18:07.760
<v Speaker 4>From this viewer account.</v>

2323
01:18:07.761 --> 01:18:08.080
<v Speaker 4>I haven't,</v>

2324
01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:08.571
<v Speaker 4>obviously,</v>

2325
01:18:08.571 --> 01:18:10.190
<v Speaker 4>I'm not reading them all cause I can't,</v>

2326
01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:12.080
<v Speaker 4>I put my father on it,</v>

2327
01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:13.330
<v Speaker 4>so he's like swan</v>

2328
01:18:13.510 --> 01:18:14.161
<v Speaker 1>with email,</v>

2329
01:18:14.161 --> 01:18:14.994
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2330
01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:16.303
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2331
01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:20.200
<v Speaker 4>He hates it and loves it at the same time.</v>

2332
01:18:21.590 --> 01:18:22.600
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2333
01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:26.710
<v Speaker 4>it's really quite interesting having these letters and they kind of fall into</v>

2334
01:18:26.711 --> 01:18:28.550
<v Speaker 4>three bs.</v>

2335
01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:31.870
<v Speaker 4>One Band is one person in a hundred who isn't very happy with me.</v>

2336
01:18:32.050 --> 01:18:32.351
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2337
01:18:32.351 --> 01:18:33.050
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2338
01:18:33.050 --> 01:18:33.883
<v Speaker 4>so fine.</v>

2339
01:18:34.860 --> 01:18:37.990
<v Speaker 4>And then about 25% say,</v>

2340
01:18:38.070 --> 01:18:40.030
<v Speaker 4>and this is what my students have told me for years,</v>

2341
01:18:40.031 --> 01:18:40.301
<v Speaker 4>they say,</v>

2342
01:18:40.301 --> 01:18:41.134
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2343
01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:44.890
<v Speaker 4>listening to you has allowed me to put in words things I already knew,</v>

2344
01:18:44.891 --> 01:18:46.690
<v Speaker 4>but that I didn't know how to say</v>

2345
01:18:52.930 --> 01:18:54.160
<v Speaker 1>be good for something</v>

2346
01:18:58.900 --> 01:18:59.810
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically done.</v>

2347
01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.150
<v Speaker 4>It could be good for that.</v>

2348
01:19:01.530 --> 01:19:05.270
<v Speaker 4>So despite the older other's sins,</v>

2349
01:19:05.510 --> 01:19:06.343
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

2350
01:19:06.450 --> 01:19:09.860
<v Speaker 4>and then the other one say I was in a bad place,</v>

2351
01:19:09.861 --> 01:19:10.281
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2352
01:19:10.281 --> 01:19:12.500
<v Speaker 4>I was drinking too much or I was addicted.</v>

2353
01:19:12.570 --> 01:19:14.090
<v Speaker 4>I didn't get along with my family.</v>

2354
01:19:14.330 --> 01:19:18.560
<v Speaker 4>I was able to sit with my girlfriend and my was nihilistic,</v>

2355
01:19:18.590 --> 01:19:18.980
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2356
01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:19.791
<v Speaker 4>depressed,</v>

2357
01:19:19.791 --> 01:19:19.940
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2358
01:19:19.940 --> 01:19:21.140
<v Speaker 4>overweight,</v>

2359
01:19:21.290 --> 01:19:22.550
<v Speaker 4>didn't have a plan.</v>

2360
01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:23.621
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2361
01:19:23.621 --> 01:19:27.080
<v Speaker 4>you know the horrible pitfalls pits that people can fall in.</v>

2362
01:19:27.081 --> 01:19:31.460
<v Speaker 4>You know there's like 30 dimensional pit of hell that people end up in.</v>

2363
01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:36.110
<v Speaker 4>So they ranked say how they were located in their particular bit of hail and</v>

2364
01:19:36.111 --> 01:19:36.501
<v Speaker 4>then say,</v>

2365
01:19:36.501 --> 01:19:36.891
<v Speaker 4>well look,</v>

2366
01:19:36.891 --> 01:19:39.350
<v Speaker 4>I've been trying to do some of the things you suggested.</v>

2367
01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:39.681
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2368
01:19:39.681 --> 01:19:40.640
<v Speaker 4>whatever that is,</v>

2369
01:19:40.641 --> 01:19:43.550
<v Speaker 4>be more responsible or try not to lie.</v>

2370
01:19:43.580 --> 01:19:44.570
<v Speaker 4>That's a good thing.</v>

2371
01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:46.190
<v Speaker 4>Try not to lie for a month.</v>

2372
01:19:46.370 --> 01:19:47.420
<v Speaker 4>It's really hard.</v>

2373
01:19:47.780 --> 01:19:49.730
<v Speaker 4>It's almost everything you say is a lie.</v>

2374
01:19:50.030 --> 01:19:51.140
<v Speaker 4>It's unbelievable.</v>

2375
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:52.590
<v Speaker 4>It's a good sign.</v>

2376
01:19:52.590 --> 01:19:53.260
<v Speaker 4>Believable.</v>

2377
01:19:53.260 --> 01:19:54.081
<v Speaker 4>It's how much,</v>

2378
01:19:54.081 --> 01:19:55.830
<v Speaker 4>it's just how lightning,</v>

2379
01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.290
<v Speaker 4>not merely that it's an outright lie.</v>

2380
01:19:58.291 --> 01:19:59.440
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what it to be a faucet,</v>

2381
01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:02.990
<v Speaker 4>but that you're saying things that have no bearing on your life.</v>

2382
01:20:03.170 --> 01:20:04.580
<v Speaker 4>Like they're not your things.</v>

2383
01:20:04.581 --> 01:20:07.040
<v Speaker 4>You know you're saying that to impress people or,</v>

2384
01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:11.100
<v Speaker 4>or you're saying that because you think they sound good or who knows what a bit</v>

2385
01:20:11.101 --> 01:20:14.610
<v Speaker 4>stuck in your mind or you read a book and you think those are your ideas now or</v>

2386
01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:15.720
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>

2387
01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:17.010
<v Speaker 4>All lies.</v>

2388
01:20:17.860 --> 01:20:22.380
<v Speaker 4>That's so you can just stop doing that and I will straighten out your horrible</v>

2389
01:20:22.410 --> 01:20:26.130
<v Speaker 4>to stop doing that because you find out that almost everything you say is a lie.</v>

2390
01:20:26.131 --> 01:20:29.220
<v Speaker 4>And that's so depressing to realize that,</v>

2391
01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:30.190
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2392
01:20:30.190 --> 01:20:31.410
<v Speaker 4>the people say,</v>

2393
01:20:31.411 --> 01:20:31.651
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2394
01:20:31.651 --> 01:20:31.921
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2395
01:20:31.921 --> 01:20:35.190
<v Speaker 4>I've been making incremental improvements.</v>

2396
01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:36.713
<v Speaker 4>I don't work.</v>

2397
01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:37.801
<v Speaker 4>It's so,</v>

2398
01:20:37.801 --> 01:20:38.634
<v Speaker 4>so fun.</v>

2399
01:20:38.730 --> 01:20:41.100
<v Speaker 4>This is one of the things that's so fun about what I'm doing.</v>

2400
01:20:41.310 --> 01:20:43.080
<v Speaker 4>What I'm doing is completely insane.</v>

2401
01:20:43.081 --> 01:20:43.681
<v Speaker 4>And there's lots of,</v>

2402
01:20:43.681 --> 01:20:45.950
<v Speaker 4>if it isn't fun at all but does some of it,</v>

2403
01:20:45.951 --> 01:20:46.980
<v Speaker 4>it's just great,</v>

2404
01:20:46.981 --> 01:20:47.251
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2405
01:20:47.251 --> 01:20:48.810
<v Speaker 4>because wherever I go now,</v>

2406
01:20:48.811 --> 01:20:50.850
<v Speaker 4>people come up to me on the street and they say,</v>

2407
01:20:51.300 --> 01:20:52.290
<v Speaker 4>here's the little,</v>

2408
01:20:52.350 --> 01:20:52.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2409
01:20:52.830 --> 01:20:55.650
<v Speaker 4>place in Halo than I was two years ago.</v>

2410
01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:57.330
<v Speaker 4>And then they describe it and they say,</v>

2411
01:20:57.331 --> 01:20:57.550
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2412
01:20:57.550 --> 01:21:01.140
<v Speaker 4>can I be trying out some of the things you've been recommending?</v>

2413
01:21:01.141 --> 01:21:02.340
<v Speaker 4>And it's way better.</v>

2414
01:21:02.670 --> 01:21:02.911
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2415
01:21:02.911 --> 01:21:03.744
<v Speaker 4>Oh God,</v>

2416
01:21:03.910 --> 01:21:04.860
<v Speaker 4>that's so good.</v>

2417
01:21:04.861 --> 01:21:05.490
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2418
01:21:05.490 --> 01:21:05.831
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2419
01:21:05.831 --> 01:21:06.450
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2420
01:21:06.450 --> 01:21:09.870
<v Speaker 4>and so well that justifies the whole office as far as I'm concerned.</v>

2421
01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:10.380
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

2422
01:21:10.380 --> 01:21:10.801
<v Speaker 4>but that's,</v>

2423
01:21:10.801 --> 01:21:13.680
<v Speaker 4>it's a testament to the strength of just exactly doing that.</v>

2424
01:21:13.681 --> 01:21:15.840
<v Speaker 4>Cause you can use yourself as your own marker.</v>

2425
01:21:16.230 --> 01:21:18.780
<v Speaker 4>You know perfectly well that there's more to you than meets the eye.</v>

2426
01:21:18.930 --> 01:21:20.400
<v Speaker 4>You absolutely know that.</v>

2427
01:21:20.401 --> 01:21:22.200
<v Speaker 4>That's so cool that everyone knows that.</v>

2428
01:21:22.230 --> 01:21:22.920
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2429
01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:23.880
<v Speaker 4>And that's what we have,</v>

2430
01:21:23.881 --> 01:21:24.840
<v Speaker 4>this deep shame,</v>

2431
01:21:24.841 --> 01:21:27.030
<v Speaker 4>that sort of associated with original sin.</v>

2432
01:21:27.031 --> 01:21:28.800
<v Speaker 4>That's how the Catholics put their finger on it.</v>

2433
01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:32.940
<v Speaker 4>We all have this deep shame because we know who we're not who we could be.</v>

2434
01:21:33.260 --> 01:21:33.541
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2435
01:21:33.541 --> 01:21:34.374
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2436
01:21:34.860 --> 01:21:36.480
<v Speaker 4>that's an optimistic thing.</v>

2437
01:21:36.690 --> 01:21:38.370
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're not who you could be.</v>

2438
01:21:38.510 --> 01:21:39.240
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>

2439
01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:40.620
<v Speaker 4>who could you me?</v>

2440
01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:41.131
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2441
01:21:41.131 --> 01:21:41.964
<v Speaker 4>maybe you could be.</v>

2442
01:21:42.300 --> 01:21:47.220
<v Speaker 4>It's way better than you are and who knows what that would do and why not find</v>

2443
01:21:47.221 --> 01:21:47.491
<v Speaker 4>out?</v>

2444
01:21:47.491 --> 01:21:49.170
<v Speaker 4>Because like you don't have anything better to do,</v>

2445
01:21:49.530 --> 01:21:51.210
<v Speaker 4>so might as well find out.</v>

2446
01:21:53.060 --> 01:21:55.950
<v Speaker 4>So that's an optimistic message in the middle of all the pessimism.</v>

2447
01:21:56.310 --> 01:21:57.210
<v Speaker 4>Rule Five,</v>

2448
01:21:57.540 --> 01:22:00.180
<v Speaker 4>don't let your children do anything that makes you dislike the,</v>

2449
01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:01.410
<v Speaker 4>I thought that</v>

2450
01:22:01.410 --> 01:22:02.243
<v Speaker 1>for me the most,</v>

2451
01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:10.170
<v Speaker 4>I thought that would be the most contentious chapter because it has to do with</v>

2452
01:22:10.350 --> 01:22:11.520
<v Speaker 4>disciplining children,</v>

2453
01:22:11.521 --> 01:22:12.240
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

2454
01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:13.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2455
01:22:13.050 --> 01:22:14.280
<v Speaker 4>that's a touchy subject,</v>

2456
01:22:14.910 --> 01:22:17.280
<v Speaker 4>but there's two elements to that rule.</v>

2457
01:22:17.281 --> 01:22:18.540
<v Speaker 4>Basically you want is,</v>

2458
01:22:19.110 --> 01:22:19.470
<v Speaker 4>it's an,</v>

2459
01:22:19.470 --> 01:22:23.640
<v Speaker 4>it's an injunction to clearheaded pessimistic thinking,</v>

2460
01:22:23.641 --> 01:22:27.900
<v Speaker 4>I would say is the first thing you have to do if you're going to abide by that</v>

2461
01:22:27.901 --> 01:22:32.280
<v Speaker 4>rule is you have to admit that your children can do things that are dislikable.</v>

2462
01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:33.540
<v Speaker 4>No one.</v>

2463
01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:36.330
<v Speaker 4>Everyone knows that obviously.</v>

2464
01:22:36.390 --> 01:22:36.631
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2465
01:22:36.631 --> 01:22:38.130
<v Speaker 4>when you were a kid there were kids who hate it,</v>

2466
01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:38.670
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2467
01:22:38.670 --> 01:22:38.971
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2468
01:22:38.971 --> 01:22:40.560
<v Speaker 4>so how was that change?</v>

2469
01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:41.230
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

2470
01:22:41.230 --> 01:22:41.740
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

2471
01:22:41.740 --> 01:22:42.930
<v Speaker 4>your friends have kids,</v>

2472
01:22:43.530 --> 01:22:45.300
<v Speaker 4>you don't like them.</v>

2473
01:22:47.910 --> 01:22:49.670
<v Speaker 4>Some of them you don't like in this cancer,</v>

2474
01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:52.590
<v Speaker 4>horrible little monsters and their parents let them do it's true.</v>

2475
01:22:53.100 --> 01:22:55.890
<v Speaker 4>And their parents let them do all sorts of reprehensible things that are</v>

2476
01:22:55.891 --> 01:22:57.780
<v Speaker 4>absolutely in no one's best interest.</v>

2477
01:22:57.960 --> 01:23:00.180
<v Speaker 4>And they kind of either kind of embarrassed about it,</v>

2478
01:23:00.330 --> 01:23:03.330
<v Speaker 4>but in the sort of smiling way and they won't do anything about it.</v>

2479
01:23:03.630 --> 01:23:05.470
<v Speaker 4>Except then you don't invite them over anymore.</v>

2480
01:23:05.471 --> 01:23:06.280
<v Speaker 4>And think wider walls,</v>

2481
01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:06.700
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2482
01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:08.830
<v Speaker 4>not my friends liked me ever since I have kids.</v>

2483
01:23:08.831 --> 01:23:08.951
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2484
01:23:08.951 --> 01:23:09.101
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2485
01:23:09.101 --> 01:23:09.671
<v Speaker 4>it's not that.</v>

2486
01:23:09.671 --> 01:23:10.350
<v Speaker 4>It's your kids,</v>

2487
01:23:10.350 --> 01:23:10.841
<v Speaker 4>their kids,</v>

2488
01:23:10.841 --> 01:23:11.674
<v Speaker 4>your kids,</v>

2489
01:23:12.110 --> 01:23:12.943
<v Speaker 4>my kids.</v>

2490
01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:18.120
<v Speaker 4>And so you have to admit that kids can be dislikable.</v>

2491
01:23:18.370 --> 01:23:19.300
<v Speaker 4>Well that's hard tax.</v>

2492
01:23:19.301 --> 01:23:21.470
<v Speaker 4>And he saved the hat cause they don't,</v>

2493
01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:22.030
<v Speaker 4>kids are,</v>

2494
01:23:22.030 --> 01:23:22.920
<v Speaker 4>oh they're wonderful.</v>

2495
01:23:22.940 --> 01:23:23.231
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2496
01:23:23.231 --> 01:23:23.801
<v Speaker 4>well they are,</v>

2497
01:23:23.801 --> 01:23:26.710
<v Speaker 4>but we don't have to be stupidly naive about it.</v>

2498
01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:32.040
<v Speaker 4>So maybe you have to admit it's even worse that your kids could be dislikable.</v>

2499
01:23:32.830 --> 01:23:34.630
<v Speaker 4>That's a lot harder thing to swallow.</v>

2500
01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:38.380
<v Speaker 4>And then you have to also admit you're the sort of person that could dislike</v>

2501
01:23:38.381 --> 01:23:39.310
<v Speaker 4>your own kids.</v>

2502
01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:43.510
<v Speaker 4>And if you don't think that in your,</v>

2503
01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:44.740
<v Speaker 4>you're dangerous,</v>

2504
01:23:45.250 --> 01:23:45.971
<v Speaker 4>you're dangerous.</v>

2505
01:23:45.971 --> 01:23:47.140
<v Speaker 4>If you don't know that,</v>

2506
01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:51.120
<v Speaker 4>that's one thing you definitely learn as a clinical psychologist is because like</v>

2507
01:23:51.121 --> 01:23:56.121
<v Speaker 4>half the people that you see come to see you because their parents brutalized in</v>

2508
01:23:57.191 --> 01:23:58.210
<v Speaker 4>every possible way.</v>

2509
01:23:58.211 --> 01:23:59.230
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes physically,</v>

2510
01:23:59.231 --> 01:24:00.310
<v Speaker 4>sometimes sexually,</v>

2511
01:24:00.490 --> 01:24:02.800
<v Speaker 4>more often mentally.</v>

2512
01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:03.130
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2513
01:24:03.130 --> 01:24:07.300
<v Speaker 4>I've had clients who like the parental rule was wait till your kid does</v>

2514
01:24:07.301 --> 01:24:09.250
<v Speaker 4>something good and then hit the,</v>

2515
01:24:09.870 --> 01:24:10.240
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

2516
01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:12.370
<v Speaker 4>Maybe physically that's not even so bad.</v>

2517
01:24:12.430 --> 01:24:13.480
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's bad,</v>

2518
01:24:13.690 --> 01:24:17.980
<v Speaker 4>but that's not the best way to really go after someone if they're doing</v>

2519
01:24:17.981 --> 01:24:18.910
<v Speaker 4>something good,</v>

2520
01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:19.631
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2521
01:24:19.631 --> 01:24:22.450
<v Speaker 4>you want to wait until they do something good and then maybe you want to demean</v>

2522
01:24:22.451 --> 01:24:22.990
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

2523
01:24:22.990 --> 01:24:26.760
<v Speaker 4>You don't like with a few cutting remarks over like an hour,</v>

2524
01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:30.970
<v Speaker 4>something like that and [inaudible] you there are two or 300 times to your kid</v>

2525
01:24:30.971 --> 01:24:31.661
<v Speaker 4>and they'll be very,</v>

2526
01:24:31.661 --> 01:24:34.870
<v Speaker 4>very careful about ever doing anything good around you again.</v>

2527
01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:35.700
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2528
01:24:35.700 --> 01:24:36.390
<v Speaker 4>then you win,</v>

2529
01:24:36.390 --> 01:24:36.641
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2530
01:24:36.641 --> 01:24:40.450
<v Speaker 4>Because well then you get to be martyr or a parent who has this terrible child</v>

2531
01:24:40.451 --> 01:24:42.840
<v Speaker 4>that you have to lug around and he was always ungrateful.</v>

2532
01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:46.330
<v Speaker 4>You can whine to your relatives about it and they can pat you on the back for</v>

2533
01:24:46.331 --> 01:24:49.330
<v Speaker 4>being so compassionate and tolerant.</v>

2534
01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:54.720
<v Speaker 4>This is just absolutely sickening and it happens way more often than you think</v>

2535
01:24:55.060 --> 01:24:55.630
<v Speaker 4>and so,</v>

2536
01:24:55.630 --> 01:24:57.940
<v Speaker 4>and if you don't think that you can do that,</v>

2537
01:25:02.170 --> 01:25:03.790
<v Speaker 4>if you don't think that you can do that,</v>

2538
01:25:03.791 --> 01:25:07.360
<v Speaker 4>then you don't know anything about yourself or about other human beings because</v>

2539
01:25:07.361 --> 01:25:09.010
<v Speaker 4>you bloody well can do that.</v>

2540
01:25:09.070 --> 01:25:14.070
<v Speaker 4>And the probability that you've done some of that is virtually 100% some of you</v>

2541
01:25:14.621 --> 01:25:17.620
<v Speaker 4>know what you need to know if you're a parent and just if you're a human being</v>

2542
01:25:17.770 --> 01:25:22.770
<v Speaker 4>that you are a sub type of monster and you should be very careful with how you</v>

2543
01:25:23.291 --> 01:25:23.621
<v Speaker 4>act.</v>

2544
01:25:23.621 --> 01:25:26.740
<v Speaker 4>And part of that is you should be very careful with your children.</v>

2545
01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:28.060
<v Speaker 4>Like I knew why didn't talk,</v>

2546
01:25:28.061 --> 01:25:28.721
<v Speaker 4>I had kids,</v>

2547
01:25:28.721 --> 01:25:30.010
<v Speaker 4>I kind of knew what I was like,</v>

2548
01:25:30.011 --> 01:25:31.840
<v Speaker 4>although not as much as I might've,</v>

2549
01:25:32.140 --> 01:25:34.390
<v Speaker 4>but I knew something about what it was like and I thought,</v>

2550
01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:40.020
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to let my kids make me upset and angry because God only knows what</v>

2551
01:25:40.571 --> 01:25:42.670
<v Speaker 4>will happen if they do that.</v>

2552
01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:46.240
<v Speaker 4>And it isn't like an explosive outburst of tamper or something like that.</v>

2553
01:25:46.241 --> 01:25:46.451
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

2554
01:25:46.451 --> 01:25:49.630
<v Speaker 4>You hear now and then about a parent who's done something absolutely dreadful to</v>

2555
01:25:49.631 --> 01:25:50.500
<v Speaker 4>their children and you think,</v>

2556
01:25:50.501 --> 01:25:50.591
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2557
01:25:50.591 --> 01:25:51.520
<v Speaker 4>how could that happen?</v>

2558
01:25:51.521 --> 01:25:53.430
<v Speaker 4>It's just think about it for awhile.</v>

2559
01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:56.350
<v Speaker 4>If you actually want to know how something like that could happen,</v>

2560
01:25:56.740 --> 01:25:59.080
<v Speaker 4>you just have to sit and think about it for about an hour.</v>

2561
01:25:59.770 --> 01:26:03.680
<v Speaker 4>Like it's horrifying to put yourself in the place of that parent.</v>

2562
01:26:03.830 --> 01:26:05.360
<v Speaker 4>People generally won't do it,</v>

2563
01:26:05.510 --> 01:26:06.620
<v Speaker 4>but if you want to understand,</v>

2564
01:26:06.621 --> 01:26:06.950
<v Speaker 4>you can,</v>

2565
01:26:06.950 --> 01:26:07.850
<v Speaker 4>you can understand.</v>

2566
01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:10.700
<v Speaker 4>It's just that you said you don't want to and no wonder,</v>

2567
01:26:10.790 --> 01:26:15.790
<v Speaker 4>but I knew that I was perfectly capable of taking revenge on anybody that</v>

2568
01:26:16.190 --> 01:26:17.090
<v Speaker 4>crossed me,</v>

2569
01:26:17.150 --> 01:26:17.983
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

2570
01:26:18.170 --> 01:26:19.800
<v Speaker 4>and that the best way to deal without,</v>

2571
01:26:19.850 --> 01:26:21.860
<v Speaker 4>apart from trying to improve my own character,</v>

2572
01:26:21.861 --> 01:26:23.600
<v Speaker 4>listening to my wife when she's trying to,</v>

2573
01:26:23.601 --> 01:26:24.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2574
01:26:24.020 --> 01:26:24.860
<v Speaker 4>sort me out,</v>

2575
01:26:25.220 --> 01:26:30.220
<v Speaker 4>was to not encourage my children to be horrible little monsters because they're</v>

2576
01:26:32.781 --> 01:26:37.781
<v Speaker 4>little and fragile and I'm way bigger and way meaner and way more malevolent.</v>

2577
01:26:40.430 --> 01:26:42.230
<v Speaker 4>And so it's much better for them.</v>

2578
01:26:42.290 --> 01:26:47.290
<v Speaker 4>It's much better for them if they behave in a manner that elicits the positive</v>

2579
01:26:47.870 --> 01:26:49.220
<v Speaker 4>element from me.</v>

2580
01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:51.830
<v Speaker 4>And it's not that hard to encourage children to do that.</v>

2581
01:26:51.831 --> 01:26:55.040
<v Speaker 4>Like if you have some sense and you'd notice your own irritation,</v>

2582
01:26:55.041 --> 01:26:58.640
<v Speaker 4>I mean you can't assume your perfect because you're not and you're going to have</v>

2583
01:26:58.641 --> 01:27:00.020
<v Speaker 4>arbitrary irritations,</v>

2584
01:27:00.021 --> 01:27:03.460
<v Speaker 4>but that's partly why you have a partner to kind of keep you on the straight and</v>

2585
01:27:03.461 --> 01:27:04.294
<v Speaker 4>narrow,</v>

2586
01:27:04.370 --> 01:27:09.370
<v Speaker 4>but you do your children a great favor by not letting them act in a way that</v>

2587
01:27:10.161 --> 01:27:10.994
<v Speaker 4>irritates you.</v>

2588
01:27:11.060 --> 01:27:12.170
<v Speaker 4>But even more importantly,</v>

2589
01:27:12.171 --> 01:27:14.390
<v Speaker 4>and this is where the rubber really hits the road,</v>

2590
01:27:14.391 --> 01:27:19.391
<v Speaker 4>is what's your role as a parent to promote the self esteem of your children?</v>

2591
01:27:20.060 --> 01:27:20.331
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2592
01:27:20.331 --> 01:27:21.164
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2593
01:27:22.190 --> 01:27:22.490
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2594
01:27:22.490 --> 01:27:23.930
<v Speaker 4>That is not your role.</v>

2595
01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:25.210
<v Speaker 4>That's bald headed</v>

2596
01:27:25.380 --> 01:27:26.050
<v Speaker 1>psychologists.</v>

2597
01:27:26.050 --> 01:27:31.050
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2598
01:27:31.970 --> 01:27:35.210
<v Speaker 4>your role is to make your children welcome wherever they go.</v>

2599
01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:37.250
<v Speaker 4>That's your role.</v>

2600
01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:42.460
<v Speaker 4>Your role is to help your children maintain that gloss of innocence and</v>

2601
01:27:42.651 --> 01:27:43.371
<v Speaker 4>attracted this.</v>

2602
01:27:43.371 --> 01:27:47.300
<v Speaker 4>That's part and parcel of being a child so that when they interact with other</v>

2603
01:27:47.301 --> 01:27:47.930
<v Speaker 4>children,</v>

2604
01:27:47.930 --> 01:27:49.910
<v Speaker 4>those children want to play it with them.</v>

2605
01:27:50.130 --> 01:27:51.920
<v Speaker 4>If that means your child has to know how to play.</v>

2606
01:27:52.070 --> 01:27:56.300
<v Speaker 4>Super important that your child knows how to play with other kids because other</v>

2607
01:27:56.301 --> 01:27:58.130
<v Speaker 4>kids socialize your children.</v>

2608
01:27:58.340 --> 01:28:02.570
<v Speaker 4>And if your child isn't socialized properly by the age of four so that other</v>

2609
01:28:02.571 --> 01:28:04.370
<v Speaker 4>children want to play with him or her,</v>

2610
01:28:04.430 --> 01:28:05.500
<v Speaker 4>they're done.</v>

2611
01:28:05.630 --> 01:28:08.210
<v Speaker 4>You failed and you can't fix it.</v>

2612
01:28:08.990 --> 01:28:12.650
<v Speaker 4>So it's really because what happens is the kids play with the other kids who can</v>

2613
01:28:12.651 --> 01:28:16.240
<v Speaker 4>play and their development takes off and you're a kid who can't play,</v>

2614
01:28:16.260 --> 01:28:17.780
<v Speaker 4>gets left in the dust.</v>

2615
01:28:18.110 --> 01:28:19.880
<v Speaker 4>And there's a huge literature on that,</v>

2616
01:28:19.910 --> 01:28:20.721
<v Speaker 4>that very,</v>

2617
01:28:20.721 --> 01:28:21.920
<v Speaker 4>very depressing literature,</v>

2618
01:28:21.921 --> 01:28:24.140
<v Speaker 4>like most truthful psychological literatures.</v>

2619
01:28:24.141 --> 01:28:25.080
<v Speaker 4>And that's what it indicates.</v>

2620
01:28:25.670 --> 01:28:26.360
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

2621
01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:27.290
<v Speaker 4>well it's the case,</v>

2622
01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:27.711
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2623
01:28:27.711 --> 01:28:29.150
<v Speaker 4>if you're a social scientist,</v>

2624
01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:30.800
<v Speaker 4>you know you've discovered something true.</v>

2625
01:28:30.801 --> 01:28:33.740
<v Speaker 4>If you hate it and it violates your political instincts,</v>

2626
01:28:33.830 --> 01:28:35.020
<v Speaker 4>it's like a fact</v>

2627
01:28:36.370 --> 01:28:41.370
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] so,</v>

2628
01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:47.180
<v Speaker 4>but you also want for your children,</v>

2629
01:28:47.420 --> 01:28:49.640
<v Speaker 4>like we taught our kids how to behave in restaurants.</v>

2630
01:28:49.820 --> 01:28:50.011
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>

2631
01:28:50.011 --> 01:28:53.000
<v Speaker 4>we take them to restaurants when they were little all in for about 45 minutes</v>

2632
01:28:53.001 --> 01:28:53.541
<v Speaker 4>when they were little.</v>

2633
01:28:53.541 --> 01:28:55.670
<v Speaker 4>Cause you can't expect a kid to sit for too long,</v>

2634
01:28:55.880 --> 01:28:56.960
<v Speaker 4>but you know the rule,</v>

2635
01:28:56.961 --> 01:28:57.321
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

2636
01:28:57.321 --> 01:29:00.710
<v Speaker 4>well you can come to the restaurant but you have to act like a civilized</v>

2637
01:29:00.711 --> 01:29:04.170
<v Speaker 4>creature and if you didn't then we went and stood outside.</v>

2638
01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:04.750
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2639
01:29:04.750 --> 01:29:06.660
<v Speaker 4>and even if it was winter,</v>

2640
01:29:06.690 --> 01:29:09.600
<v Speaker 4>so I could remember my daughter who's in the audience tonight,</v>

2641
01:29:09.601 --> 01:29:10.434
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

2642
01:29:10.830 --> 01:29:15.830
<v Speaker 1>Stephanie [inaudible],</v>

2643
01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:19.660
<v Speaker 4>please behave in the restaurant.</v>

2644
01:29:19.661 --> 01:29:20.381
<v Speaker 4>Judge Tall,</v>

2645
01:29:20.381 --> 01:29:23.140
<v Speaker 4>some stunting cause kids will do that and you take them to a new place.</v>

2646
01:29:23.141 --> 01:29:23.970
<v Speaker 4>They'll pull some stuff.</v>

2647
01:29:23.970 --> 01:29:25.480
<v Speaker 4>They never try it at home.</v>

2648
01:29:25.690 --> 01:29:26.770
<v Speaker 4>It's because they know and they think,</v>

2649
01:29:26.771 --> 01:29:27.190
<v Speaker 4>ha,</v>

2650
01:29:27.190 --> 01:29:28.750
<v Speaker 4>what are you going to do if I do this here?</v>

2651
01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:31.020
<v Speaker 4>It's like I'm going to take you on.</v>

2652
01:29:31.030 --> 01:29:31.260
<v Speaker 4>Sorry,</v>

2653
01:29:31.260 --> 01:29:34.590
<v Speaker 4>we're going to stamp where it's cold down there.</v>

2654
01:29:34.900 --> 01:29:36.910
<v Speaker 4>She looked at me and I look at her say,</v>

2655
01:29:37.420 --> 01:29:38.620
<v Speaker 4>how's this going for you?</v>

2656
01:29:38.900 --> 01:29:39.733
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2657
01:29:39.990 --> 01:29:40.271
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

2658
01:29:40.271 --> 01:29:40.541
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2659
01:29:40.541 --> 01:29:41.310
<v Speaker 4>It's cool though here.</v>

2660
01:29:41.310 --> 01:29:43.000
<v Speaker 4>Race like was it better than the restaurant?</v>

2661
01:29:43.030 --> 01:29:43.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2662
01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:43.961
<v Speaker 4>it was.</v>

2663
01:29:43.961 --> 01:29:45.100
<v Speaker 4>Do you want to go back to the restaurant?</v>

2664
01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:46.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2665
01:29:46.270 --> 01:29:49.480
<v Speaker 4>You want to act like a civilized human being and we'll go back at the</v>

2666
01:29:49.481 --> 01:29:50.051
<v Speaker 4>restaurant.</v>

2667
01:29:50.051 --> 01:29:50.410
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2668
01:29:50.410 --> 01:29:50.621
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2669
01:29:50.621 --> 01:29:51.790
<v Speaker 4>okay back.</v>

2670
01:29:51.791 --> 01:29:52.291
<v Speaker 4>We'd go.</v>

2671
01:29:52.291 --> 01:29:53.860
<v Speaker 4>I know it was pretty straight forward.</v>

2672
01:29:53.861 --> 01:29:55.240
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty straight forward,</v>

2673
01:29:55.570 --> 01:29:56.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2674
01:29:56.020 --> 01:29:57.220
<v Speaker 4>so and that worked.</v>

2675
01:29:57.640 --> 01:30:01.360
<v Speaker 4>But what was so fun about that was first of all we got to go to restaurants and</v>

2676
01:30:01.361 --> 01:30:05.350
<v Speaker 4>so that lead is not quite as bitter and horrible about being parents as we</v>

2677
01:30:05.351 --> 01:30:06.184
<v Speaker 4>might've been.</v>

2678
01:30:06.970 --> 01:30:07.803
<v Speaker 4>The second was,</v>

2679
01:30:08.050 --> 01:30:10.450
<v Speaker 4>you know that adults are there adults,</v>

2680
01:30:10.451 --> 01:30:12.970
<v Speaker 4>he didn't know the kids would respond to them really positively.</v>

2681
01:30:12.971 --> 01:30:16.640
<v Speaker 4>So we take the kids to restaurants and they'd all sit there and smile and eaten,</v>

2682
01:30:16.820 --> 01:30:17.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2683
01:30:17.170 --> 01:30:21.010
<v Speaker 4>be civilized in that other parents or other adults will come along and say they</v>

2684
01:30:21.011 --> 01:30:21.731
<v Speaker 4>pat them and say,</v>

2685
01:30:21.731 --> 01:30:21.941
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2686
01:30:21.941 --> 01:30:25.450
<v Speaker 4>you kids really behaved well and then they'd actually smile at them.</v>

2687
01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:28.330
<v Speaker 4>You know how it fits a kid into restaurant causing all sorts of trouble.</v>

2688
01:30:28.510 --> 01:30:29.710
<v Speaker 4>You kind of smile.</v>

2689
01:30:29.711 --> 01:30:31.780
<v Speaker 4>But like a carnivorous Fab pyre.</v>

2690
01:30:31.790 --> 01:30:32.920
<v Speaker 4>That's sorta how you smile.</v>

2691
01:30:34.070 --> 01:30:36.660
<v Speaker 4>But the kids would go out and because they were behaving,</v>

2692
01:30:36.670 --> 01:30:36.911
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2693
01:30:36.911 --> 01:30:40.570
<v Speaker 4>with a certain amount of propriety that all the adults would show their good</v>

2694
01:30:40.571 --> 01:30:40.700
<v Speaker 4>side.</v>

2695
01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:42.460
<v Speaker 4>Cause I don't actually like kids,</v>

2696
01:30:42.670 --> 01:30:47.590
<v Speaker 4>you know like you have to be a pretty dark person to not have a small child</v>

2697
01:30:47.620 --> 01:30:47.981
<v Speaker 4>light,</v>

2698
01:30:47.981 --> 01:30:49.450
<v Speaker 4>a little light in your heart,</v>

2699
01:30:49.480 --> 01:30:50.230
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2700
01:30:50.230 --> 01:30:54.520
<v Speaker 4>And so as long as the child isn't doing everything in its power to extinguish</v>

2701
01:30:54.521 --> 01:30:55.354
<v Speaker 4>that light,</v>

2702
01:30:55.510 --> 01:30:56.590
<v Speaker 4>then you know,</v>

2703
01:30:56.660 --> 01:31:00.310
<v Speaker 4>you can get some positive responses even from really rough people.</v>

2704
01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:04.060
<v Speaker 4>And so the kids would go out to restaurants and people would pat them and smile</v>

2705
01:31:04.061 --> 01:31:06.250
<v Speaker 4>at them and not like how,</v>

2706
01:31:06.251 --> 01:31:08.200
<v Speaker 4>why would you want that for your kids?</v>

2707
01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:09.270
<v Speaker 4>You want your kids,</v>

2708
01:31:09.270 --> 01:31:10.450
<v Speaker 4>other kids like them.</v>

2709
01:31:10.870 --> 01:31:11.680
<v Speaker 4>What a deal.</v>

2710
01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:14.560
<v Speaker 4>Then other kids liked them and invite them to play games and they have a good</v>

2711
01:31:14.561 --> 01:31:19.561
<v Speaker 4>life and adults want to have them around and we'll be nice to them and teach</v>

2712
01:31:19.721 --> 01:31:20.554
<v Speaker 4>them things.</v>

2713
01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:22.660
<v Speaker 4>It's like your dad parent,</v>

2714
01:31:22.661 --> 01:31:23.860
<v Speaker 4>you're done right.</v>

2715
01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:27.340
<v Speaker 4>And you can do most of that by the time the kids for so,</v>

2716
01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:32.400
<v Speaker 4>but you have to come to the terms with the fact that kids aren't innately good</v>

2717
01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:34.870
<v Speaker 4>and neither are you.</v>

2718
01:31:34.930 --> 01:31:35.920
<v Speaker 4>That's for sure.</v>

2719
01:31:36.250 --> 01:31:39.040
<v Speaker 4>And so you have to act like a,</v>

2720
01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:41.200
<v Speaker 4>like a intelligent person with some,</v>

2721
01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:46.520
<v Speaker 4>some apprehension of your own horror and the terrible things that you're capable</v>

2722
01:31:47.141 --> 01:31:52.141
<v Speaker 4>of doing and then regulate your household so that those things aren't necessary.</v>

2723
01:31:52.990 --> 01:31:54.430
<v Speaker 4>And so that's really useful.</v>

2724
01:31:54.640 --> 01:31:56.200
<v Speaker 4>So that's rule five.</v>

2725
01:31:56.470 --> 01:31:57.303
<v Speaker 1>Well</v>

2726
01:32:03.850 --> 01:32:04.900
<v Speaker 4>rule six,</v>

2727
01:32:07.420 --> 01:32:10.840
<v Speaker 4>put yourself house in perfect order before you criticize the world.</v>

2728
01:32:10.980 --> 01:32:11.813
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

2729
01:32:12.210 --> 01:32:17.070
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2730
01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:23.080
<v Speaker 4>about the mass shooters mostly not only I talk about this guy named Carl,</v>

2731
01:32:24.141 --> 01:32:28.400
<v Speaker 4>Pam's round in the chapter and pans ramp was this mass killer.</v>

2732
01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:30.380
<v Speaker 4>He kept track of everyone he killed.</v>

2733
01:32:30.381 --> 01:32:33.860
<v Speaker 4>He kept track of all the buildings he first down and the dollar value.</v>

2734
01:32:34.130 --> 01:32:38.090
<v Speaker 4>He was out for mayhem and no wonder like he was a delinquent kid.</v>

2735
01:32:38.091 --> 01:32:42.140
<v Speaker 4>I think he was one kid at 14 or something in the Midwest and he's kind of a bad</v>

2736
01:32:42.141 --> 01:32:42.830
<v Speaker 4>kid.</v>

2737
01:32:42.830 --> 01:32:47.830
<v Speaker 4>And then they sent them to a reform school as they did not help put it that way.</v>

2738
01:32:48.770 --> 01:32:53.770
<v Speaker 4>He was seriously brutalized in the reform school in all the inventive and</v>

2739
01:32:53.901 --> 01:32:58.040
<v Speaker 4>creative ways that you might imagine that a child could be abused in a reform</v>

2740
01:32:58.041 --> 01:32:58.431
<v Speaker 4>school.</v>

2741
01:32:58.431 --> 01:32:59.840
<v Speaker 4>That basically happened to him.</v>

2742
01:33:00.100 --> 01:33:01.460
<v Speaker 4>And when he came out,</v>

2743
01:33:01.490 --> 01:33:03.830
<v Speaker 4>he was not a happy person.</v>

2744
01:33:04.550 --> 01:33:09.550
<v Speaker 4>And so he decided that he would devote his life to producing as much misery as</v>

2745
01:33:09.741 --> 01:33:11.000
<v Speaker 4>he possibly could.</v>

2746
01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:12.850
<v Speaker 4>And he wrote it.</v>

2747
01:33:13.010 --> 01:33:15.020
<v Speaker 4>He wrote an autobiography.</v>

2748
01:33:15.950 --> 01:33:17.090
<v Speaker 4>He was in prison,</v>

2749
01:33:17.510 --> 01:33:22.100
<v Speaker 4>beat half to death by the guards and no doubt deservedly so.</v>

2750
01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:23.400
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

2751
01:33:24.290 --> 01:33:29.290
<v Speaker 4>a doctor in the prison gave him a dollar to buy cigarettes or something like</v>

2752
01:33:29.421 --> 01:33:30.000
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2753
01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.270
<v Speaker 4>pads around in his own accounts had that,</v>

2754
01:33:32.271 --> 01:33:35.490
<v Speaker 4>that was the only kind of thing that he could remember anyone ever doing for</v>

2755
01:33:35.491 --> 01:33:35.780
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

2756
01:33:35.780 --> 01:33:36.141
<v Speaker 4>Well then,</v>

2757
01:33:36.141 --> 01:33:36.711
<v Speaker 4>no wonder,</v>

2758
01:33:36.711 --> 01:33:37.460
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2759
01:33:37.460 --> 01:33:37.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2760
01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:39.170
<v Speaker 4>it's a complicated story,</v>

2761
01:33:39.171 --> 01:33:40.310
<v Speaker 4>but he wasn't like,</v>

2762
01:33:40.340 --> 01:33:44.390
<v Speaker 4>he was like a dog that comes up to you and bites your ankle and is surprised</v>

2763
01:33:44.391 --> 01:33:45.580
<v Speaker 4>that it doesn't get petted,</v>

2764
01:33:45.590 --> 01:33:46.190
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

2765
01:33:46.190 --> 01:33:47.023
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2766
01:33:47.350 --> 01:33:50.540
<v Speaker 4>and I'm saying that with some due regard for the fact that he did in fact have</v>

2767
01:33:50.541 --> 01:33:51.980
<v Speaker 4>an absolutely dismal life.</v>

2768
01:33:51.981 --> 01:33:52.191
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2769
01:33:52.191 --> 01:33:52.371
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2770
01:33:52.371 --> 01:33:56.570
<v Speaker 4>he got tortured pretty bad that he was very badly when he was a teenager.</v>

2771
01:33:57.140 --> 01:33:57.973
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2772
01:33:57.980 --> 01:33:58.401
<v Speaker 4>anyways,</v>

2773
01:33:58.401 --> 01:34:03.401
<v Speaker 4>Patra writes about his hatred for,</v>

2774
01:34:03.650 --> 01:34:05.660
<v Speaker 4>it's not just himself,</v>

2775
01:34:06.410 --> 01:34:07.850
<v Speaker 4>but for other people,</v>

2776
01:34:08.150 --> 01:34:09.110
<v Speaker 4>absolute hatred.</v>

2777
01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:12.890
<v Speaker 4>But it went way past that because like if you're going to hate,</v>

2778
01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:16.670
<v Speaker 4>you're only get warmed up if you hate yourself and other people that's you</v>

2779
01:34:16.671 --> 01:34:16.881
<v Speaker 4>think,</v>

2780
01:34:16.881 --> 01:34:18.410
<v Speaker 4>well that's about as bad as it can get.</v>

2781
01:34:18.420 --> 01:34:18.771
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2782
01:34:18.771 --> 01:34:19.490
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2783
01:34:19.490 --> 01:34:22.940
<v Speaker 4>like there's this old idea that hell is a bottomless pit,</v>

2784
01:34:22.990 --> 01:34:23.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2785
01:34:23.630 --> 01:34:25.280
<v Speaker 4>and there's a psychological reason for that.</v>

2786
01:34:25.281 --> 01:34:26.114
<v Speaker 4>And the reason for that is,</v>

2787
01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:28.040
<v Speaker 4>is that no matter how bad something is,</v>

2788
01:34:28.041 --> 01:34:29.390
<v Speaker 4>you could make it worse.</v>

2789
01:34:29.660 --> 01:34:32.390
<v Speaker 4>And so like there's no limit to hate.</v>

2790
01:34:32.660 --> 01:34:35.360
<v Speaker 4>And you might start by hating yourself and other people,</v>

2791
01:34:35.361 --> 01:34:36.650
<v Speaker 4>but that's your,</v>

2792
01:34:36.651 --> 01:34:38.600
<v Speaker 4>that's just beginner hate.</v>

2793
01:34:38.870 --> 01:34:41.150
<v Speaker 4>If you really push it,</v>

2794
01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:43.430
<v Speaker 4>not only do you come to hate,</v>

2795
01:34:43.820 --> 01:34:46.250
<v Speaker 4>you would come to hate being itself.</v>

2796
01:34:46.430 --> 01:34:50.510
<v Speaker 4>The mere fact that the reason anything fills you with rage,</v>

2797
01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:51.890
<v Speaker 4>but that isn't even where you,</v>

2798
01:34:52.100 --> 01:34:55.330
<v Speaker 4>you don't even stop there if you're really proficient at he,</v>

2799
01:34:55.870 --> 01:34:56.270
<v Speaker 4>ew,</v>

2800
01:34:56.270 --> 01:34:56.630
<v Speaker 4>ew,</v>

2801
01:34:56.630 --> 01:34:56.870
<v Speaker 4>ew.</v>

2802
01:34:56.870 --> 01:35:01.130
<v Speaker 4>That's of a philosophical hate and you're getting pretty down to the bottom of</v>

2803
01:35:01.131 --> 01:35:03.260
<v Speaker 4>things when you're philosophical in your hatred,</v>

2804
01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:06.560
<v Speaker 4>but you're not as far down as you could get if you want to get right to the</v>

2805
01:35:06.561 --> 01:35:09.110
<v Speaker 4>bottom and you get theological into your hate,</v>

2806
01:35:09.590 --> 01:35:10.071
<v Speaker 4>and if you get,</v>

2807
01:35:10.071 --> 01:35:11.200
<v Speaker 4>feel logical in your hate,</v>

2808
01:35:11.201 --> 01:35:13.760
<v Speaker 4>and I don't care if you're at the ECS than your pull the page,</v>

2809
01:35:13.761 --> 01:35:14.960
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't make any difference.</v>

2810
01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:15.800
<v Speaker 4>It's this is this.</v>

2811
01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:16.640
<v Speaker 4>That's all irrelevant.</v>

2812
01:35:17.090 --> 01:35:22.090
<v Speaker 4>You Act as if there's someone responsible for the horror of being,</v>

2813
01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:24.913
<v Speaker 4>let's</v>

2814
01:35:26.180 --> 01:35:29.540
<v Speaker 4>call that God and you hate him</v>

2815
01:35:30.910 --> 01:35:35.910
<v Speaker 4>and then you do everything you possibly can to make that be a hypothetical or</v>

2816
01:35:36.221 --> 01:35:41.110
<v Speaker 4>otherwise as angry and sad about your existence,</v>

2817
01:35:41.111 --> 01:35:46.111
<v Speaker 4>antibiotic resistance itself as you possibly can with all of the imagination and</v>

2818
01:35:47.261 --> 01:35:50.100
<v Speaker 4>tools at your disposal and then you,</v>

2819
01:35:50.380 --> 01:35:50.830
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

2820
01:35:50.830 --> 01:35:55.660
<v Speaker 4>you're getting way down in the Haight hierarchy when you do that,</v>

2821
01:35:55.840 --> 01:35:57.490
<v Speaker 4>and if you don't believe that,</v>

2822
01:35:57.550 --> 01:35:58.383
<v Speaker 4>go read about it.</v>

2823
01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:03.760
<v Speaker 4>Go read the diaries of the kids who shot up the Columbine high school and see if</v>

2824
01:36:03.761 --> 01:36:05.980
<v Speaker 4>that isn't exactly what they say.</v>

2825
01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:06.851
<v Speaker 4>These people,</v>

2826
01:36:06.851 --> 01:36:07.090
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2827
01:36:07.090 --> 01:36:08.500
<v Speaker 4>they write manifestos,</v>

2828
01:36:08.860 --> 01:36:13.510
<v Speaker 4>they tell you exactly what they're thinking and that's exactly what they tell</v>

2829
01:36:13.511 --> 01:36:14.860
<v Speaker 4>you and that's what pans up his head.</v>

2830
01:36:14.861 --> 01:36:15.460
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

2831
01:36:15.460 --> 01:36:16.700
<v Speaker 4>you know what his dying words are.</v>

2832
01:36:16.750 --> 01:36:17.583
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

2833
01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:22.750
<v Speaker 4>I wish the human race pet one neck so that I could put my hands around it.</v>

2834
01:36:22.751 --> 01:36:23.770
<v Speaker 4>Then squeeze.</v>

2835
01:36:23.830 --> 01:36:24.820
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the quotes.</v>

2836
01:36:24.820 --> 01:36:25.690
<v Speaker 4>That's a pretty good one.</v>

2837
01:36:25.900 --> 01:36:27.070
<v Speaker 4>His dying words,</v>

2838
01:36:27.071 --> 01:36:28.000
<v Speaker 4>he was being hung.</v>

2839
01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:31.660
<v Speaker 4>There was a woman's group that tried to stop him from being hung and he wasn't</v>

2840
01:36:31.661 --> 01:36:32.980
<v Speaker 4>very happy with him by the way.</v>

2841
01:36:32.981 --> 01:36:34.540
<v Speaker 4>And let them know that quite blunt blade.</v>

2842
01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:37.000
<v Speaker 4>And he said he was in Indiana.</v>

2843
01:36:37.001 --> 01:36:38.110
<v Speaker 4>He said to the hang man,</v>

2844
01:36:38.590 --> 01:36:39.190
<v Speaker 4>hurry up you,</v>

2845
01:36:39.190 --> 01:36:40.210
<v Speaker 4>who's your basket?</v>

2846
01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:44.230
<v Speaker 4>I could kill tip men and the time it's taking you to new stuff.</v>

2847
01:36:44.231 --> 01:36:45.064
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2848
01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:46.210
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2849
01:36:46.210 --> 01:36:47.830
<v Speaker 4>That's Carl pants route man.</v>

2850
01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:49.480
<v Speaker 4>That's really something.</v>

2851
01:36:49.481 --> 01:36:53.950
<v Speaker 4>So the chapters about him and it's about the Columbine kids who left a pretty</v>

2852
01:36:53.951 --> 01:36:55.230
<v Speaker 4>decent stock of writings.</v>

2853
01:36:55.231 --> 01:36:59.410
<v Speaker 4>And how about the guy who showed up the elementary school about people like</v>

2854
01:36:59.411 --> 01:36:59.681
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2855
01:36:59.681 --> 01:37:02.980
<v Speaker 4>if what their motivation is and why they're so angry,</v>

2856
01:37:03.070 --> 01:37:08.050
<v Speaker 4>like so unbelievably hellishly say tactically angry cause that's the only</v>

2857
01:37:08.051 --> 01:37:11.590
<v Speaker 4>language that really suffices to describe that level of outreach.</v>

2858
01:37:11.710 --> 01:37:12.543
<v Speaker 4>You can't even,</v>

2859
01:37:12.730 --> 01:37:17.260
<v Speaker 4>you're not even close to describing what's going on in situations like that.</v>

2860
01:37:17.650 --> 01:37:20.320
<v Speaker 4>You find yourself forced to use a theological language.</v>

2861
01:37:20.321 --> 01:37:25.321
<v Speaker 4>It's the only language that suffices to encapsulate that kind of absolute</v>

2862
01:37:25.451 --> 01:37:26.320
<v Speaker 4>brutality.</v>

2863
01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:27.071
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2864
01:37:27.071 --> 01:37:27.540
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2865
01:37:27.540 --> 01:37:28.480
<v Speaker 4>it's hellish.</v>

2866
01:37:32.110 --> 01:37:32.740
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2867
01:37:32.740 --> 01:37:34.130
<v Speaker 4>They make a powerful case for him.</v>

2868
01:37:34.950 --> 01:37:35.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2869
01:37:35.260 --> 01:37:36.220
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing.</v>

2870
01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:39.910
<v Speaker 4>It's powerful enough to convince them of it's right now.</v>

2871
01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:40.710
<v Speaker 4>Sorry,</v>

2872
01:37:40.710 --> 01:37:41.580
<v Speaker 4>I looked at that.</v>

2873
01:37:42.390 --> 01:37:42.640
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

2874
01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:43.300
<v Speaker 4>It's all about it.</v>

2875
01:37:43.300 --> 01:37:43.880
<v Speaker 4>A lot.</v>

2876
01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:47.200
<v Speaker 4>Almost like cause life is very hard and people do get betrayed in there is</v>

2877
01:37:47.210 --> 01:37:48.320
<v Speaker 4>malevolence in the world.</v>

2878
01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:49.353
<v Speaker 4>Like it's,</v>

2879
01:37:49.370 --> 01:37:49.670
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2880
01:37:49.670 --> 01:37:49.830
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2881
01:37:49.830 --> 01:37:53.390
<v Speaker 4>I don't think there's a single person alive who doesn't have some point think,</v>

2882
01:37:53.870 --> 01:37:54.220
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2883
01:37:54.220 --> 01:37:56.640
<v Speaker 3>well maybe I should it that's one thing.</v>

2884
01:37:56.970 --> 01:37:58.340
<v Speaker 3>But not even that to say,</v>

2885
01:37:58.380 --> 01:38:01.890
<v Speaker 3>well maybe this is just so terrible that it should just not exist at all.</v>

2886
01:38:02.270 --> 01:38:06.300
<v Speaker 3>You'll find yourself in situations like that when your dreams are dashed really</v>

2887
01:38:06.301 --> 01:38:08.760
<v Speaker 3>in an unpleasant way or someone close to you has a very,</v>

2888
01:38:08.761 --> 01:38:10.080
<v Speaker 3>very painful illness,</v>

2889
01:38:10.081 --> 01:38:10.914
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

2890
01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:12.210
<v Speaker 3>Especially if it's a child,</v>

2891
01:38:12.570 --> 01:38:14.930
<v Speaker 3>it's very easy to B two B.</v>

2892
01:38:17.590 --> 01:38:17.801
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2893
01:38:17.801 --> 01:38:22.090
<v Speaker 3>to find yourself questioning whether beating itself is a justifiable,</v>

2894
01:38:22.630 --> 01:38:24.830
<v Speaker 3>if reality itself is just the firewall.</v>

2895
01:38:25.620 --> 01:38:27.460
<v Speaker 3>It's like because of all it's suffering.</v>

2896
01:38:31.900 --> 01:38:33.880
<v Speaker 3>So what do you do about,</v>

2897
01:38:36.100 --> 01:38:40.180
<v Speaker 3>so there's this book I read called the cocktail party Celia,</v>

2898
01:38:40.330 --> 01:38:45.330
<v Speaker 3>and then in the cocktail party there's a woman who speaks to a psychiatrist and</v>

2899
01:38:46.391 --> 01:38:48.370
<v Speaker 3>she says that her life isn't going very well.</v>

2900
01:38:48.371 --> 01:38:49.330
<v Speaker 3>She's suffering a lot,</v>

2901
01:38:50.250 --> 01:38:52.210
<v Speaker 3>and she tells the psychiatrist,</v>

2902
01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:55.360
<v Speaker 3>I really hope that this is my fault.</v>

2903
01:38:56.440 --> 01:38:57.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm the psychiatrist says,</v>

2904
01:38:57.941 --> 01:38:58.774
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2905
01:38:59.080 --> 01:38:59.913
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean you hope?</v>

2906
01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:00.880
<v Speaker 3>If this is your fault,</v>

2907
01:39:00.881 --> 01:39:01.990
<v Speaker 3>why would you hope that?</v>

2908
01:39:02.470 --> 01:39:02.981
<v Speaker 3>And she says,</v>

2909
01:39:02.981 --> 01:39:03.191
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2910
01:39:03.191 --> 01:39:03.431
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2911
01:39:03.431 --> 01:39:04.241
<v Speaker 3>if it's my fault,</v>

2912
01:39:04.241 --> 01:39:05.650
<v Speaker 3>then maybe I could do something about it.</v>

2913
01:39:05.651 --> 01:39:06.370
<v Speaker 3>But if it's just,</v>

2914
01:39:06.370 --> 01:39:07.690
<v Speaker 3>this is just how it is,</v>

2915
01:39:07.870 --> 01:39:10.480
<v Speaker 3>it's like if this is just the structure of reality,</v>

2916
01:39:10.481 --> 01:39:11.710
<v Speaker 3>then I've lost.</v>

2917
01:39:12.180 --> 01:39:12.850
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2918
01:39:12.850 --> 01:39:14.380
<v Speaker 3>that's a really good thought.</v>

2919
01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:14.681
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2920
01:39:14.681 --> 01:39:16.030
<v Speaker 3>Tsla Ian was a genius.</v>

2921
01:39:16.150 --> 01:39:17.310
<v Speaker 3>That's a really good thoughts,</v>

2922
01:39:17.350 --> 01:39:19.870
<v Speaker 3>like that's a pretty good place to start because you think,</v>

2923
01:39:19.871 --> 01:39:20.680
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2924
01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:24.820
<v Speaker 3>when everything isn't going you away and that's going to happen a lot.</v>

2925
01:39:24.821 --> 01:39:25.331
<v Speaker 3>You know when,</v>

2926
01:39:25.331 --> 01:39:26.350
<v Speaker 3>when there's suffering,</v>

2927
01:39:26.770 --> 01:39:31.770
<v Speaker 3>the suffering in your life exceeds what you think to be reasonable and you</v>

2928
01:39:31.811 --> 01:39:34.570
<v Speaker 3>attempted to curse fate with all that.</v>

2929
01:39:34.571 --> 01:39:35.890
<v Speaker 3>That entails.</v>

2930
01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:37.181
<v Speaker 3>You think,</v>

2931
01:39:37.181 --> 01:39:38.014
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2932
01:39:42.310 --> 01:39:43.900
<v Speaker 3>have you done everything that you could do?</v>

2933
01:39:46.450 --> 01:39:47.640
<v Speaker 3>Have you put your house in order?</v>

2934
01:39:48.420 --> 01:39:50.670
<v Speaker 3>There's opportunities that are sitting there in front of you.</v>

2935
01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:51.181
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2936
01:39:51.181 --> 01:39:53.640
<v Speaker 3>have you made full use of the right?</v>

2937
01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:55.200
<v Speaker 3>Have you imagined?</v>

2938
01:39:55.260 --> 01:39:58.650
<v Speaker 3>Because life is so difficult that you don't get to waste.</v>

2939
01:39:58.710 --> 01:39:59.940
<v Speaker 3>You don't get to waste it.</v>

2940
01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:01.680
<v Speaker 3>You don't get to waste resources.</v>

2941
01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:05.460
<v Speaker 3>They're too precious because you have too big a problem to solve and why waste</v>

2942
01:40:05.461 --> 01:40:10.260
<v Speaker 3>resources so things aren't turning out for you exactly the way you want them to.</v>

2943
01:40:10.261 --> 01:40:11.010
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2944
01:40:11.010 --> 01:40:11.880
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2945
01:40:13.700 --> 01:40:14.790
<v Speaker 3>how much time are you wasting?</v>

2946
01:40:15.250 --> 01:40:15.711
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

2947
01:40:15.711 --> 01:40:20.711
<v Speaker 3>You Ask my students there 20 something years old at the crowd of the maybe 200 I</v>

2948
01:40:21.091 --> 01:40:21.271
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

2949
01:40:21.271 --> 01:40:22.104
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2950
01:40:22.150 --> 01:40:22.410
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

2951
01:40:22.410 --> 01:40:22.771
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

2952
01:40:22.771 --> 01:40:24.420
<v Speaker 3>let's do a quick analysis of your life.</v>

2953
01:40:24.750 --> 01:40:26.580
<v Speaker 3>How many of you wasted an hour a day?</v>

2954
01:40:26.581 --> 01:40:30.780
<v Speaker 3>It's like everybody puts up their hands three hours a day.</v>

2955
01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:32.670
<v Speaker 3>Everybody puts up their hands.</v>

2956
01:40:32.671 --> 01:40:36.210
<v Speaker 3>It's like usually by seven hours a day.</v>

2957
01:40:36.270 --> 01:40:38.220
<v Speaker 3>Some people have their hands down,</v>

2958
01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:39.230
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2959
01:40:39.230 --> 01:40:40.470
<v Speaker 3>I just wasted time.</v>

2960
01:40:40.471 --> 01:40:41.060
<v Speaker 3>Like man,</v>

2961
01:40:41.060 --> 01:40:44.550
<v Speaker 3>we do a quick financial analysis cause like if you're a university student,</v>

2962
01:40:44.551 --> 01:40:47.550
<v Speaker 3>maybe your time's worth 50 bucks an hour or something like that.</v>

2963
01:40:47.580 --> 01:40:49.230
<v Speaker 3>If you consider in terms of,</v>

2964
01:40:49.290 --> 01:40:50.123
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2965
01:40:50.610 --> 01:40:51.570
<v Speaker 3>lifetime earnings,</v>

2966
01:40:51.930 --> 01:40:52.860
<v Speaker 3>it's like seven hours a,</v>

2967
01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:54.310
<v Speaker 3>it's $350</v>

2968
01:40:54.310 --> 01:40:54.611
<v Speaker 4>a day.</v>

2969
01:40:54.611 --> 01:40:56.080
<v Speaker 4>It's about $2,000 a week,</v>

2970
01:40:56.110 --> 01:40:58.660
<v Speaker 4>$40,000 months for $100,000 a year.</v>

2971
01:40:58.661 --> 01:40:59.494
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2972
01:40:59.620 --> 01:41:00.170
<v Speaker 4>fine.</v>

2973
01:41:00.170 --> 01:41:01.870
<v Speaker 4>It's like your life isn't everything.</v>

2974
01:41:01.900 --> 01:41:05.140
<v Speaker 4>It could be you're wasting a hundred thousand dollars worth of your time a year.</v>

2975
01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:08.530
<v Speaker 4>It's like maybe possibly there's a causal connection.</v>

2976
01:41:09.460 --> 01:41:11.080
<v Speaker 4>It's worth contemplating,</v>

2977
01:41:11.140 --> 01:41:11.860
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2978
01:41:11.860 --> 01:41:12.460
<v Speaker 4>Kind of.</v>

2979
01:41:12.460 --> 01:41:14.050
<v Speaker 4>This is an existential question.</v>

2980
01:41:14.051 --> 01:41:14.530
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2981
01:41:14.530 --> 01:41:17.500
<v Speaker 4>and I don't know the answer to this because I do know that life is brutally</v>

2982
01:41:17.501 --> 01:41:19.780
<v Speaker 4>difficult and that we're up against it all the time,</v>

2983
01:41:19.930 --> 01:41:21.880
<v Speaker 4>both in terms of tragedy and malevolence.</v>

2984
01:41:22.090 --> 01:41:22.960
<v Speaker 4>It's no joke,</v>

2985
01:41:22.961 --> 01:41:23.231
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2986
01:41:23.231 --> 01:41:23.710
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2987
01:41:23.710 --> 01:41:25.780
<v Speaker 4>it's full frontal attack.</v>

2988
01:41:25.900 --> 01:41:27.280
<v Speaker 4>If you're a human being,</v>

2989
01:41:27.910 --> 01:41:31.240
<v Speaker 4>it's like what do you have to mitigate against that?</v>

2990
01:41:31.660 --> 01:41:35.920
<v Speaker 4>And that's sort that is you have what presents itself to you as possibility and</v>

2991
01:41:35.921 --> 01:41:36.754
<v Speaker 4>opportunity.</v>

2992
01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:37.870
<v Speaker 4>That's all you have.</v>

2993
01:41:37.930 --> 01:41:38.800
<v Speaker 4>And so then you might say,</v>

2994
01:41:38.801 --> 01:41:39.370
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2995
01:41:39.370 --> 01:41:42.550
<v Speaker 4>if you made full use of everything that was offered to you,</v>

2996
01:41:43.900 --> 01:41:45.100
<v Speaker 4>what would your life be like?</v>

2997
01:41:46.270 --> 01:41:47.170
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>

2998
01:41:47.260 --> 01:41:51.550
<v Speaker 4>that's a thought that you can use productively.</v>

2999
01:41:52.150 --> 01:41:55.390
<v Speaker 4>It pretty much every situation forever.</v>

3000
01:41:56.080 --> 01:41:58.330
<v Speaker 4>And there's something about it that's really like,</v>

3001
01:41:58.331 --> 01:42:03.331
<v Speaker 4>it's a really profound idea because it is the case that you have.</v>

3002
01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:06.070
<v Speaker 4>I actually think this is the case.</v>

3003
01:42:06.100 --> 01:42:08.230
<v Speaker 4>I think that what we confront,</v>

3004
01:42:08.710 --> 01:42:10.900
<v Speaker 4>this is how I think reality is constituted.</v>

3005
01:42:13.030 --> 01:42:18.030
<v Speaker 4>I think that we confront reality as divine centers of consciousness.</v>

3006
01:42:19.540 --> 01:42:19.841
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

3007
01:42:19.841 --> 01:42:21.580
<v Speaker 4>I don't think there's a better way of saying that.</v>

3008
01:42:21.790 --> 01:42:26.290
<v Speaker 4>And the reason I say that define is because we don't understand consciousness at</v>

3009
01:42:26.291 --> 01:42:27.124
<v Speaker 4>all.</v>

3010
01:42:27.370 --> 01:42:29.980
<v Speaker 4>We don't understand its relationship to material reality.</v>

3011
01:42:30.220 --> 01:42:34.900
<v Speaker 4>And we do know that it's intake really involved with being no consciousness,</v>

3012
01:42:34.930 --> 01:42:35.400
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3013
01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:37.810
<v Speaker 4>no one to experience what is there.</v>

3014
01:42:39.220 --> 01:42:39.431
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3015
01:42:39.431 --> 01:42:41.620
<v Speaker 4>you can't even say there's a,</v>

3016
01:42:42.010 --> 01:42:44.770
<v Speaker 4>we've confront potential consciously,</v>

3017
01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:46.650
<v Speaker 4>we interact with it.</v>

3018
01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:47.770
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3019
01:42:47.770 --> 01:42:49.360
<v Speaker 4>how much potential is there?</v>

3020
01:42:50.050 --> 01:42:50.883
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3021
01:42:52.060 --> 01:42:56.080
<v Speaker 4>we're a very finite and constrained like a genie in a,</v>

3022
01:42:56.230 --> 01:42:58.900
<v Speaker 4>it allows just like that.</v>

3023
01:42:59.110 --> 01:43:00.970
<v Speaker 4>That's where that idea exists.</v>

3024
01:43:01.750 --> 01:43:02.650
<v Speaker 4>We're constrained,</v>

3025
01:43:03.150 --> 01:43:03.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3026
01:43:03.970 --> 01:43:04.803
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3027
01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:07.000
<v Speaker 4>and there's reason for that.</v>

3028
01:43:07.001 --> 01:43:08.140
<v Speaker 4>It's a complicated reason,</v>

3029
01:43:08.141 --> 01:43:09.730
<v Speaker 4>but we won't go into that for a moment.</v>

3030
01:43:10.330 --> 01:43:11.163
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

3031
01:43:11.170 --> 01:43:14.500
<v Speaker 4>but what we confront seems to be something that's essentially infinite in its</v>

3032
01:43:14.501 --> 01:43:15.430
<v Speaker 4>potential.</v>

3033
01:43:16.210 --> 01:43:16.871
<v Speaker 4>So then you take,</v>

3034
01:43:16.871 --> 01:43:17.290
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3035
01:43:17.290 --> 01:43:19.630
<v Speaker 4>if you have an impossible problem and you do,</v>

3036
01:43:19.660 --> 01:43:21.070
<v Speaker 4>you have an impossible problem.</v>

3037
01:43:21.070 --> 01:43:22.090
<v Speaker 4>And so does everybody else.</v>

3038
01:43:22.420 --> 01:43:24.940
<v Speaker 4>What do you need to solve an impossible problem?</v>

3039
01:43:24.970 --> 01:43:26.200
<v Speaker 4>You need an infinite,</v>

3040
01:43:26.350 --> 01:43:28.960
<v Speaker 4>you need it for the potential to solve an impossible problem.</v>

3041
01:43:29.110 --> 01:43:29.321
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3042
01:43:29.321 --> 01:43:30.850
<v Speaker 4>maybe you have that right in front of you.</v>

3043
01:43:30.970 --> 01:43:32.860
<v Speaker 4>And I actually think this is true.</v>

3044
01:43:33.220 --> 01:43:38.220
<v Speaker 4>I think that if you conducted your life as if what you had in front of you was</v>

3045
01:43:38.741 --> 01:43:40.090
<v Speaker 4>infinite potential,</v>

3046
01:43:40.750 --> 01:43:42.580
<v Speaker 4>that he find out that that was true.</v>

3047
01:43:43.450 --> 01:43:45.910
<v Speaker 4>And I think that in interacting with that,</v>

3048
01:43:46.330 --> 01:43:51.310
<v Speaker 4>you'd also find what you needed to justify the catastrophe of your life.</v>

3049
01:43:51.490 --> 01:43:53.030
<v Speaker 4>That that's what you need to do.</v>

3050
01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:58.000
<v Speaker 4>And maybe maybe you could even find it so that you would accept it.</v>

3051
01:43:58.880 --> 01:43:59.713
<v Speaker 4>You'd except the,</v>

3052
01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:00.823
<v Speaker 4>because</v>

3053
01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:05.420
<v Speaker 4>I tried to develop this too in the rest of the book and I didn't think I'll</v>

3054
01:44:05.421 --> 01:44:06.470
<v Speaker 4>probably close with this.</v>

3055
01:44:07.250 --> 01:44:09.260
<v Speaker 4>I thought about my son when he was a little kid.</v>

3056
01:44:09.290 --> 01:44:10.123
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3057
01:44:10.190 --> 01:44:11.030
<v Speaker 4>it's about three.</v>

3058
01:44:11.060 --> 01:44:12.680
<v Speaker 4>He was super cute kid.</v>

3059
01:44:12.740 --> 01:44:13.790
<v Speaker 4>I still think he's cute,</v>

3060
01:44:13.791 --> 01:44:15.620
<v Speaker 4>but he's like 26 and he doesn't care.</v>

3061
01:44:15.830 --> 01:44:18.980
<v Speaker 4>So He's a really cute kid.</v>

3062
01:44:19.010 --> 01:44:19.361
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

3063
01:44:19.361 --> 01:44:21.020
<v Speaker 4>he's three and three year olds.</v>

3064
01:44:21.350 --> 01:44:21.891
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

3065
01:44:21.891 --> 01:44:24.200
<v Speaker 4>they stand up under tables and bumped their head.</v>

3066
01:44:24.220 --> 01:44:26.630
<v Speaker 4>Like they fall down the stairs and other kids pushed them over.</v>

3067
01:44:26.631 --> 01:44:27.290
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3068
01:44:27.290 --> 01:44:28.123
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3069
01:44:28.250 --> 01:44:31.880
<v Speaker 4>you're pretty fragile when you're three and it's kind of painful if you're a</v>

3070
01:44:31.881 --> 01:44:35.150
<v Speaker 4>parrot noticing how fragile and your children are.</v>

3071
01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:36.530
<v Speaker 4>And so you think,</v>

3072
01:44:36.830 --> 01:44:36.981
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3073
01:44:36.981 --> 01:44:38.450
<v Speaker 4>it's painful that fragility.</v>

3074
01:44:39.500 --> 01:44:41.060
<v Speaker 4>And then so I did a little thought exercise.</v>

3075
01:44:41.061 --> 01:44:41.331
<v Speaker 4>I thought,</v>

3076
01:44:41.331 --> 01:44:41.541
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3077
01:44:41.541 --> 01:44:42.230
<v Speaker 4>well let's,</v>

3078
01:44:42.230 --> 01:44:46.040
<v Speaker 4>let's dispense with the fragility since it's so painful.</v>

3079
01:44:46.041 --> 01:44:46.371
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3080
01:44:46.371 --> 01:44:51.371
<v Speaker 4>well he shouldn't be like three feet tall because that's not working out 20 feet</v>

3081
01:44:52.941 --> 01:44:53.774
<v Speaker 4>tall.</v>

3082
01:44:53.780 --> 01:44:54.620
<v Speaker 4>That'd be good.</v>

3083
01:44:54.910 --> 01:44:55.340
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

3084
01:44:55.340 --> 01:44:56.180
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3085
01:44:56.270 --> 01:44:58.070
<v Speaker 4>why camper to be made of flesh and blood?</v>

3086
01:44:58.070 --> 01:44:58.903
<v Speaker 4>Because what we do,</v>

3087
01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:01.160
<v Speaker 4>we know if that that's a problem.</v>

3088
01:45:01.300 --> 01:45:01.641
<v Speaker 4>It's like to,</v>

3089
01:45:01.641 --> 01:45:02.780
<v Speaker 4>how about titanium?</v>

3090
01:45:02.781 --> 01:45:06.860
<v Speaker 4>Who just replace it with robotic part so it can be 20 feet tall and made of</v>

3091
01:45:06.890 --> 01:45:07.820
<v Speaker 4>titanium.</v>

3092
01:45:08.300 --> 01:45:08.750
<v Speaker 4>It don't want,</v>

3093
01:45:08.750 --> 01:45:13.750
<v Speaker 4>obviously you want something like that to be capable of defending itself.</v>

3094
01:45:14.241 --> 01:45:16.130
<v Speaker 4>So it's kind of a fighting machine.</v>

3095
01:45:16.131 --> 01:45:16.431
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3096
01:45:16.431 --> 01:45:16.761
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3097
01:45:16.761 --> 01:45:21.350
<v Speaker 4>well so now I can dispense with my three year old sound and I can have this 20</v>

3098
01:45:21.351 --> 01:45:24.590
<v Speaker 4>foot tall robotic fighting machine that's more or less indestructible.</v>

3099
01:45:25.250 --> 01:45:26.083
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3100
01:45:26.290 --> 01:45:27.980
<v Speaker 4>who's going to make that trade?</v>

3101
01:45:29.060 --> 01:45:32.990
<v Speaker 4>And that's strange j because it's not,</v>

3102
01:45:33.050 --> 01:45:35.090
<v Speaker 4>it's not obvious why you wouldn't make that trade.</v>

3103
01:45:35.091 --> 01:45:38.960
<v Speaker 4>But what happens is that by sacrificing that for agility,</v>

3104
01:45:39.020 --> 01:45:40.190
<v Speaker 4>which is what you'd be doing,</v>

3105
01:45:40.670 --> 01:45:43.040
<v Speaker 4>you actually end up sacrificing what you love.</v>

3106
01:45:43.730 --> 01:45:44.570
<v Speaker 4>And so then you think,</v>

3107
01:45:44.571 --> 01:45:44.750
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3108
01:45:44.750 --> 01:45:45.830
<v Speaker 4>isn't that a funny thing?</v>

3109
01:45:45.831 --> 01:45:47.100
<v Speaker 4>Because we,</v>

3110
01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:48.650
<v Speaker 4>we love people.</v>

3111
01:45:48.740 --> 01:45:48.951
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3112
01:45:48.951 --> 01:45:50.390
<v Speaker 4>we all have someone we love if we're,</v>

3113
01:45:50.391 --> 01:45:54.110
<v Speaker 4>if we're the least bit fortunate and so often our children hopefully,</v>

3114
01:45:54.530 --> 01:45:55.790
<v Speaker 4>but then there's that,</v>

3115
01:45:56.300 --> 01:45:56.631
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

3116
01:45:56.631 --> 01:45:59.000
<v Speaker 4>you see this also when your parents get older,</v>

3117
01:45:59.180 --> 01:45:59.421
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3118
01:45:59.421 --> 01:46:01.970
<v Speaker 4>they start getting fragile and all sorts of ways and you think,</v>

3119
01:46:01.971 --> 01:46:03.290
<v Speaker 4>well God,</v>

3120
01:46:03.300 --> 01:46:04.880
<v Speaker 4>it's not so good that there so fragile.</v>

3121
01:46:04.881 --> 01:46:05.151
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3122
01:46:05.151 --> 01:46:05.451
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3123
01:46:05.451 --> 01:46:06.500
<v Speaker 4>start replacing it.</v>

3124
01:46:07.010 --> 01:46:08.580
<v Speaker 4>What were you going to stop?</v>

3125
01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:11.930
<v Speaker 4>You're going to start with all of that fragility gone.</v>

3126
01:46:11.931 --> 01:46:13.340
<v Speaker 4>It's like the person's gone then.</v>

3127
01:46:13.910 --> 01:46:17.390
<v Speaker 4>And so then there's this strange way where if you love someone,</v>

3128
01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:23.360
<v Speaker 4>you civil tenuously love and accept their fragility and that,</v>

3129
01:46:23.361 --> 01:46:26.780
<v Speaker 4>that means that in some way you actually think it's justifiable that the heart,</v>

3130
01:46:26.781 --> 01:46:28.040
<v Speaker 4>that's what I thought about my son.</v>

3131
01:46:28.041 --> 01:46:28.371
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3132
01:46:28.371 --> 01:46:28.551
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3133
01:46:28.551 --> 01:46:29.301
<v Speaker 4>I think he's fine.</v>

3134
01:46:29.301 --> 01:46:31.640
<v Speaker 4>Just the way he is like three years old,</v>

3135
01:46:31.910 --> 01:46:33.050
<v Speaker 4>God has problems,</v>

3136
01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:33.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3137
01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:35.660
<v Speaker 4>certainly gets hurt a fair bit.</v>

3138
01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:37.910
<v Speaker 4>And is probably going to get hurt more,</v>

3139
01:46:37.940 --> 01:46:39.440
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not trained in.</v>

3140
01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:41.210
<v Speaker 4>I liked them just the way he is.</v>

3141
01:46:41.211 --> 01:46:42.740
<v Speaker 4>And so that's like a,</v>

3142
01:46:42.860 --> 01:46:47.860
<v Speaker 4>it's a realization of the soul that there's something about the fragility of</v>

3143
01:46:49.171 --> 01:46:53.340
<v Speaker 4>human life that's actually valuable and they just still limitation.</v>

3144
01:46:53.370 --> 01:46:57.570
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing that's so cool about it is that it's this limitation that we</v>

3145
01:46:57.571 --> 01:46:58.890
<v Speaker 4>are because that's what we are,</v>

3146
01:46:58.891 --> 01:47:00.120
<v Speaker 4>is we're limitation.</v>

3147
01:47:00.420 --> 01:47:00.631
<v Speaker 4>We're,</v>

3148
01:47:00.631 --> 01:47:01.140
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

3149
01:47:01.140 --> 01:47:01.921
<v Speaker 4>we're potential.</v>

3150
01:47:01.921 --> 01:47:05.910
<v Speaker 4>Can conjoin with limitation in some sense take well we want to get rid of the</v>

3151
01:47:05.940 --> 01:47:07.920
<v Speaker 4>limitation but it's not the case.</v>

3152
01:47:08.070 --> 01:47:11.550
<v Speaker 4>We have to keep the limitation because it's integral to who we are.</v>

3153
01:47:11.610 --> 01:47:16.500
<v Speaker 4>And so we're in this situation where we have to be limited and we have to accept</v>

3154
01:47:16.501 --> 01:47:21.501
<v Speaker 4>it and we have to confront what's essentially an infinite potential to help us</v>

3155
01:47:21.601 --> 01:47:22.434
<v Speaker 4>manage it.</v>

3156
01:47:23.340 --> 01:47:24.630
<v Speaker 4>And I think that,</v>

3157
01:47:24.900 --> 01:47:27.960
<v Speaker 4>I think that that's why I think that that's true.</v>

3158
01:47:29.130 --> 01:47:30.390
<v Speaker 4>I think that's how we act.</v>

3159
01:47:30.391 --> 01:47:31.590
<v Speaker 4>I think it's what we expect.</v>

3160
01:47:31.591 --> 01:47:34.440
<v Speaker 4>I think it's what we need to know cause you have to say,</v>

3161
01:47:34.441 --> 01:47:38.580
<v Speaker 4>and that's part of standing up straight paid and accepting the tragedy and</v>

3162
01:47:38.581 --> 01:47:40.080
<v Speaker 4>catastrophe of existence.</v>

3163
01:47:40.260 --> 01:47:42.190
<v Speaker 4>This is partly why I think the West Florida,</v>

3164
01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:43.073
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3165
01:47:44.460 --> 01:47:45.770
<v Speaker 4>Because I do think we got it right.</v>

3166
01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:50.910
<v Speaker 4>The central story where a Judeo Christian culture and there's a,</v>

3167
01:47:51.090 --> 01:47:55.860
<v Speaker 4>there's a central story at the bottom and the story is about the radical</v>

3168
01:47:55.861 --> 01:47:57.720
<v Speaker 4>acceptance of fragility.</v>

3169
01:47:58.440 --> 01:48:00.480
<v Speaker 4>That's what the crucifixion represents.</v>

3170
01:48:00.690 --> 01:48:03.120
<v Speaker 4>The fact that that's a voluntary act and it,</v>

3171
01:48:03.150 --> 01:48:04.320
<v Speaker 4>it's about everybody.</v>

3172
01:48:04.350 --> 01:48:04.981
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing.</v>

3173
01:48:04.981 --> 01:48:05.940
<v Speaker 4>It's about everybody.</v>

3174
01:48:05.970 --> 01:48:06.780
<v Speaker 4>It's that,</v>

3175
01:48:06.780 --> 01:48:07.613
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3176
01:48:08.190 --> 01:48:09.023
<v Speaker 4>you're going to die,</v>

3177
01:48:09.540 --> 01:48:11.130
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be betrayed.</v>

3178
01:48:11.490 --> 01:48:12.930
<v Speaker 4>Those are going to happen.</v>

3179
01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:17.000
<v Speaker 4>And so you can either shrink from that and maybe,</v>

3180
01:48:17.050 --> 01:48:22.050
<v Speaker 4>and maybe it develop yourself in bitterness and hatred and no wonder no other,</v>

3181
01:48:22.860 --> 01:48:24.360
<v Speaker 4>or you can say,</v>

3182
01:48:25.290 --> 01:48:26.430
<v Speaker 4>bring it on,</v>

3183
01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:29.060
<v Speaker 1>bring it on.</v>

3184
01:48:29.060 --> 01:48:34.060
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

3185
01:48:41.340 --> 01:48:42.161
<v Speaker 4>and so I would say,</v>

3186
01:48:42.161 --> 01:48:42.994
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3187
01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:46.960
<v Speaker 4>I've looked at dark things as much as I can,</v>

3188
01:48:47.890 --> 01:48:48.251
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3189
01:48:48.251 --> 01:48:51.040
<v Speaker 4>and I think that's probably hurt me in many ways,</v>

3190
01:48:51.520 --> 01:48:54.640
<v Speaker 4>but let's be not unbelievably helpful,</v>

3191
01:48:54.850 --> 01:48:55.121
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3192
01:48:55.121 --> 01:48:59.770
<v Speaker 4>because the thing about darkness is it makes the light stand up.</v>

3193
01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:04.810
<v Speaker 4>And as I've looked deeper and deeper into terrible things,</v>

3194
01:49:06.220 --> 01:49:10.600
<v Speaker 4>I've also realized that that there's something amazing about human beings.</v>

3195
01:49:10.900 --> 01:49:11.111
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3196
01:49:11.111 --> 01:49:12.880
<v Speaker 4>because we are,</v>

3197
01:49:12.940 --> 01:49:17.940
<v Speaker 4>our lives are bounded by tragedy and we are capable of deep malevolence more</v>

3198
01:49:18.591 --> 01:49:20.830
<v Speaker 4>solar than you can almost imagine,</v>

3199
01:49:22.060 --> 01:49:23.860
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think that's what defines us.</v>

3200
01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:24.753
<v Speaker 4>I really don't.</v>

3201
01:49:24.940 --> 01:49:27.790
<v Speaker 4>I think what defines us is the ability to transcend that.</v>

3202
01:49:28.090 --> 01:49:30.730
<v Speaker 4>I truly believe that and so I'm not pessimistic.</v>

3203
01:49:30.731 --> 01:49:32.630
<v Speaker 4>I'm optimistic and knowing know.</v>

3204
01:49:32.890 --> 01:49:34.270
<v Speaker 4>I do believe that people,</v>

3205
01:49:34.271 --> 01:49:37.090
<v Speaker 4>I believe that people are embodied miracles.</v>

3206
01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:40.690
<v Speaker 4>I really think that's the right way of thinking about it and I think we all know</v>

3207
01:49:40.691 --> 01:49:45.691
<v Speaker 4>this and what I'm hoping egg in these polarized times is that</v>

3208
01:49:47.730 --> 01:49:52.730
<v Speaker 4>that we return to that realization and that we adopt the responsibility of full</v>

3209
01:49:52.901 --> 01:49:53.560
<v Speaker 4>individual.</v>

3210
01:49:53.560 --> 01:49:58.150
<v Speaker 4>Big has an antidote to well idiot political polarization,</v>

3211
01:49:58.390 --> 01:50:02.320
<v Speaker 4>but also as an impetus for us all to move forward into the future.</v>

3212
01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:04.180
<v Speaker 4>We're in an inflection point.</v>

3213
01:50:04.181 --> 01:50:05.230
<v Speaker 4>I think in our culture,</v>

3214
01:50:05.231 --> 01:50:06.064
<v Speaker 4>in the world,</v>

3215
01:50:07.030 --> 01:50:10.960
<v Speaker 4>things are opening up in front of us that have never opened up before and it's</v>

3216
01:50:10.961 --> 01:50:11.890
<v Speaker 4>very dangerous.</v>

3217
01:50:11.891 --> 01:50:16.210
<v Speaker 4>Our technological prowess is very dangerous and things could go very dreadfully</v>

3218
01:50:16.211 --> 01:50:17.044
<v Speaker 4>wrong,</v>

3219
01:50:17.290 --> 01:50:18.520
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think they have to.</v>

3220
01:50:18.521 --> 01:50:19.960
<v Speaker 4>I think they could go extraordinarily.</v>

3221
01:50:20.380 --> 01:50:21.213
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3222
01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:23.170
<v Speaker 4>And I think that each of us,</v>

3223
01:50:23.171 --> 01:50:24.001
<v Speaker 4>I do believe this,</v>

3224
01:50:24.001 --> 01:50:26.080
<v Speaker 4>that every single person sitting here,</v>

3225
01:50:26.150 --> 01:50:27.370
<v Speaker 4>every single person there is,</v>

3226
01:50:27.371 --> 01:50:31.270
<v Speaker 4>but every single person sitting here plays a key role in that decision.</v>

3227
01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:32.530
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3228
01:50:32.530 --> 01:50:33.370
<v Speaker 4>we're all part of it.</v>

3229
01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:34.690
<v Speaker 4>We're deeply networked.</v>

3230
01:50:34.691 --> 01:50:36.230
<v Speaker 4>We all influence everyone else.</v>

3231
01:50:36.231 --> 01:50:40.540
<v Speaker 4>And we are these divine centers of consciousness that are separate but United at</v>

3232
01:50:40.541 --> 01:50:41.241
<v Speaker 4>the same time.</v>

3233
01:50:41.241 --> 01:50:44.890
<v Speaker 4>And the decisions that each of us make as individuals are far more important</v>

3234
01:50:44.891 --> 01:50:48.640
<v Speaker 4>than we realize our lives are ultimately it meaningful I think.</v>

3235
01:50:48.860 --> 01:50:53.860
<v Speaker 4>And that we do decide whether by our actions we're going to bring a worse or a</v>

3236
01:50:54.101 --> 01:50:56.710
<v Speaker 4>better cosmos into Ba.</v>

3237
01:50:57.040 --> 01:51:00.730
<v Speaker 4>And I would say that we should dispense with our resentment and bitterness</v>

3238
01:51:00.760 --> 01:51:05.760
<v Speaker 4>despite the fact that we have every reason for it and stand up and face things</v>

3239
01:51:06.191 --> 01:51:10.150
<v Speaker 4>forthrightly and speak the truth and make the world a better place.</v>

3240
01:51:10.650 --> 01:51:15.650
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

3241
01:51:29.050 --> 01:51:31.710
<v Speaker 4>and that seems like a good place to stop.</v>

3242
01:51:34.600 --> 01:51:39.600
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

3243
01:52:05.650 --> 01:52:08.220
<v Speaker 2>am I mistaken or he only knocked out six rules there.</v>

3244
01:52:08.221 --> 01:52:09.054
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

3245
01:52:10.070 --> 01:52:11.810
<v Speaker 2>You guys want to do this at my place after?</v>

3246
01:52:13.880 --> 01:52:14.713
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3247
01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:16.120
<v Speaker 2>I look that could quite get all yet,</v>

3248
01:52:16.160 --> 01:52:16.840
<v Speaker 2>but we'll try it.</v>

3249
01:52:16.840 --> 01:52:17.710
<v Speaker 2>We'll see what we can do.</v>

3250
01:52:17.790 --> 01:52:18.340
<v Speaker 2>All right Jordan,</v>

3251
01:52:18.340 --> 01:52:21.930
<v Speaker 2>just taking a second to just happen to have the glass of water and uh,</v>

3252
01:52:22.030 --> 01:52:23.320
<v Speaker 2>maybe loosen his tie and then,</v>

3253
01:52:23.350 --> 01:52:24.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3254
01:52:24.090 --> 01:52:24.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3255
01:52:24.440 --> 01:52:27.340
<v Speaker 2>I guess we can do a Q and a unless you guys fully got all that.</v>

3256
01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:30.540
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

3257
01:52:31.580 --> 01:52:36.580
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

3258
01:52:39.780 --> 01:52:39.901
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3259
01:52:39.901 --> 01:52:41.180
<v Speaker 2>Harry is Jordan Peterson.</v>

3260
01:52:42.150 --> 01:52:45.950
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

3261
01:52:48.280 --> 01:52:49.180
<v Speaker 2>all right.</v>

3262
01:52:49.260 --> 01:52:51.920
<v Speaker 2>So I said is we're going to have roughly 40 billion questions.</v>

3263
01:52:51.921 --> 01:52:54.140
<v Speaker 2>There's two mics on the sides down here.</v>

3264
01:52:54.170 --> 01:52:56.240
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't do it for logistical reasons upstairs,</v>

3265
01:52:56.241 --> 01:52:58.580
<v Speaker 2>but we're told we will call on one or two.</v>

3266
01:52:58.581 --> 01:52:59.570
<v Speaker 2>You guys have yet,</v>

3267
01:52:59.660 --> 01:53:01.040
<v Speaker 2>if you speak clearly,</v>

3268
01:53:01.430 --> 01:53:02.990
<v Speaker 2>but why don't we start,</v>

3269
01:53:02.991 --> 01:53:03.660
<v Speaker 2>are we over here?</v>

3270
01:53:03.660 --> 01:53:04.171
<v Speaker 2>Where am I low?</v>

3271
01:53:04.171 --> 01:53:05.110
<v Speaker 2>And looking right over here,</v>

3272
01:53:05.240 --> 01:53:10.240
<v Speaker 2>you try to keep it kind of brief and a no major or Asian so we can get to as</v>

3273
01:53:10.581 --> 01:53:11.660
<v Speaker 2>many questions as possible.</v>

3274
01:53:11.870 --> 01:53:12.703
<v Speaker 2>Take it away.</v>

3275
01:53:13.560 --> 01:53:14.393
<v Speaker 3>Good evening.</v>

3276
01:53:14.600 --> 01:53:15.070
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3277
01:53:15.070 --> 01:53:17.460
<v Speaker 3>my question is for Dr. Peterson.</v>

3278
01:53:18.030 --> 01:53:21.420
<v Speaker 3>You referenced in 12 rules and thank you for your time.</v>

3279
01:53:21.900 --> 01:53:25.230
<v Speaker 3>Your referencing should follow the rules to the dragon that gets bigger and</v>

3280
01:53:25.231 --> 01:53:27.150
<v Speaker 3>small increments if leftover,</v>

3281
01:53:27.151 --> 01:53:27.984
<v Speaker 3>if ignored.</v>

3282
01:53:28.590 --> 01:53:29.423
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3283
01:53:29.820 --> 01:53:33.960
<v Speaker 3>I was wondering if you thought that it was possible to assume that you have</v>

3284
01:53:33.961 --> 01:53:36.180
<v Speaker 3>certain groups on the left,</v>

3285
01:53:36.660 --> 01:53:40.230
<v Speaker 3>if they achieve what they felt maybe was equity,</v>

3286
01:53:40.740 --> 01:53:45.740
<v Speaker 3>could that possibly lead to them wanting to then go further and actually subject</v>

3287
01:53:46.450 --> 01:53:48.000
<v Speaker 3>their political enemies?</v>

3288
01:53:48.660 --> 01:53:53.660
<v Speaker 3>Like what was no problem with the equity idea is that there's no limit to the</v>

3289
01:53:54.181 --> 01:53:56.610
<v Speaker 3>number of fractionation is you can make,</v>

3290
01:53:56.611 --> 01:53:58.350
<v Speaker 3>you can generate for group identity.</v>

3291
01:53:58.980 --> 01:54:02.910
<v Speaker 3>So there's an unlimited number of dimensions across which equity might be</v>

3292
01:54:02.911 --> 01:54:03.744
<v Speaker 3>attained.</v>

3293
01:54:04.080 --> 01:54:05.250
<v Speaker 3>Problem number one.</v>

3294
01:54:05.670 --> 01:54:09.510
<v Speaker 3>Problem number two is there's an infinite fractionation of group identity.</v>

3295
01:54:09.750 --> 01:54:10.590
<v Speaker 3>So it's a problem.</v>

3296
01:54:10.591 --> 01:54:12.120
<v Speaker 3>It can never be sold.</v>

3297
01:54:12.540 --> 01:54:14.780
<v Speaker 3>So I mean what,</v>

3298
01:54:14.781 --> 01:54:16.590
<v Speaker 3>what groups are you going to make equal?</v>

3299
01:54:16.620 --> 01:54:17.880
<v Speaker 3>Cause that's a quick followup.</v>

3300
01:54:17.910 --> 01:54:18.530
<v Speaker 3>I guess what,</v>

3301
01:54:18.530 --> 01:54:20.760
<v Speaker 3>so just one step further would need them.</v>

3302
01:54:20.790 --> 01:54:23.040
<v Speaker 3>So if they achieve some type of equity,</v>

3303
01:54:23.041 --> 01:54:26.760
<v Speaker 3>would they maybe determined that they're not going to be happy until they're in</v>

3304
01:54:26.761 --> 01:54:28.170
<v Speaker 3>charge of other people?</v>

3305
01:54:28.580 --> 01:54:28.900
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3306
01:54:28.900 --> 01:54:29.310
<v Speaker 3>well that,</v>

3307
01:54:29.310 --> 01:54:30.400
<v Speaker 3>that question means what?</v>

3308
01:54:30.401 --> 01:54:32.520
<v Speaker 3>What's the motivation at the bottom of all this?</v>

3309
01:54:32.521 --> 01:54:35.680
<v Speaker 3>And I don't believe that the motivation is equity at all.</v>

3310
01:54:35.710 --> 01:54:39.940
<v Speaker 3>Like I think the motivation is the ending of the patriarchal tyranny,</v>

3311
01:54:40.390 --> 01:54:41.470
<v Speaker 3>and it will find the mentally,</v>

3312
01:54:41.500 --> 01:54:42.370
<v Speaker 3>and that's not the same.</v>

3313
01:54:42.650 --> 01:54:44.020
<v Speaker 3>Those are just mechanisms.</v>

3314
01:54:44.210 --> 01:54:45.910
<v Speaker 3>Like having said that,</v>

3315
01:54:45.940 --> 01:54:46.210
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3316
01:54:46.210 --> 01:54:49.540
<v Speaker 3>I already stated that inequality is a problem.</v>

3317
01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:54.040
<v Speaker 3>Inequality drives the left and fair enough.</v>

3318
01:54:54.070 --> 01:54:57.220
<v Speaker 3>Like that's where you need a left wing is because inequality is actually a</v>

3319
01:54:57.221 --> 01:54:58.090
<v Speaker 3>political problem.</v>

3320
01:54:58.750 --> 01:55:03.430
<v Speaker 3>But the radical abolishment of inequality is not a possible goal.</v>

3321
01:55:03.850 --> 01:55:05.230
<v Speaker 3>There's one thing I did want to say.</v>

3322
01:55:05.290 --> 01:55:07.810
<v Speaker 3>We actually have a technical problem in our culture.</v>

3323
01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:08.741
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3324
01:55:08.741 --> 01:55:10.690
<v Speaker 3>And it's something that's worth thinking about.</v>

3325
01:55:11.080 --> 01:55:15.370
<v Speaker 3>So the technical problem is we can draw a border around the radical,</v>

3326
01:55:15.371 --> 01:55:16.204
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3327
01:55:16.740 --> 01:55:16.991
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3328
01:55:16.991 --> 01:55:19.780
<v Speaker 3>so conservatives can say,</v>

3329
01:55:19.930 --> 01:55:20.321
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3330
01:55:20.321 --> 01:55:24.190
<v Speaker 3>here's some people to the right of me and they're claiming racial superiority</v>

3331
01:55:24.191 --> 01:55:24.821
<v Speaker 3>doctrines.</v>

3332
01:55:24.821 --> 01:55:25.654
<v Speaker 3>Let's say,</v>

3333
01:55:25.750 --> 01:55:25.961
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3334
01:55:25.961 --> 01:55:28.240
<v Speaker 3>we're gonna put them in a box and we're going to say,</v>

3335
01:55:28.270 --> 01:55:31.360
<v Speaker 3>you're not us and we're not playing that game.</v>

3336
01:55:31.570 --> 01:55:32.290
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3337
01:55:32.290 --> 01:55:32.650
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

3338
01:55:32.650 --> 01:55:32.891
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3339
01:55:32.891 --> 01:55:36.340
<v Speaker 3>And that that happened with William F.</v>

3340
01:55:36.340 --> 01:55:37.470
<v Speaker 3>Buckley back in the 60s when,</v>

3341
01:55:37.700 --> 01:55:41.620
<v Speaker 3>when he started his conservative movement and disassociated themselves from the</v>

3342
01:55:41.621 --> 01:55:42.610
<v Speaker 3>white supremacists.</v>

3343
01:55:42.640 --> 01:55:42.950
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>

3344
01:55:42.950 --> 01:55:43.620
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3345
01:55:43.620 --> 01:55:46.020
<v Speaker 3>now we know that people can go too far on the right,</v>

3346
01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:46.920
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3347
01:55:46.920 --> 01:55:48.050
<v Speaker 3>That was what the Nazis for there,</v>

3348
01:55:48.110 --> 01:55:51.660
<v Speaker 3>but then we know that people can go too far on the left.</v>

3349
01:55:52.270 --> 01:55:52.751
<v Speaker 3>It was a beat.</v>

3350
01:55:52.751 --> 01:55:55.560
<v Speaker 3>The communists and 100 million people they manage to kill.</v>

3351
01:55:55.620 --> 01:55:55.861
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

3352
01:55:55.861 --> 01:55:58.920
<v Speaker 3>so we know that people can go too far on the left.</v>

3353
01:55:59.460 --> 01:56:00.293
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

3354
01:56:00.330 --> 01:56:01.500
<v Speaker 3>what's the marker?</v>

3355
01:56:02.700 --> 01:56:03.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3356
01:56:03.270 --> 01:56:04.950
<v Speaker 3>And the answer is we don't know.</v>

3357
01:56:05.440 --> 01:56:07.140
<v Speaker 3>And that's not a good enough answer,</v>

3358
01:56:07.530 --> 01:56:09.810
<v Speaker 3>especially not for people on the list,</v>

3359
01:56:10.320 --> 01:56:15.320
<v Speaker 3>because they have the same ethical responsibility to dissociate themselves from</v>

3360
01:56:15.331 --> 01:56:16.740
<v Speaker 3>the dangerous radicals.</v>

3361
01:56:16.930 --> 01:56:18.660
<v Speaker 3>Has the Conservatives do on the right,</v>

3362
01:56:19.170 --> 01:56:20.970
<v Speaker 3>but they're incapable of doing it.</v>

3363
01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:21.510
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

3364
01:56:21.510 --> 01:56:22.830
<v Speaker 3>partly it's technical.</v>

3365
01:56:22.860 --> 01:56:23.693
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3366
01:56:24.180 --> 01:56:24.361
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3367
01:56:24.361 --> 01:56:27.030
<v Speaker 3>you can point to racial superiority doctrines on the right can.</v>

3368
01:56:27.031 --> 01:56:27.451
<v Speaker 3>You can say,</v>

3369
01:56:27.451 --> 01:56:27.601
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3370
01:56:27.601 --> 01:56:28.710
<v Speaker 3>we're not going there.</v>

3371
01:56:28.830 --> 01:56:31.290
<v Speaker 3>What exactly do you 0.2 on the left?</v>

3372
01:56:31.890 --> 01:56:33.480
<v Speaker 3>Because the idea is in,</v>

3373
01:56:33.481 --> 01:56:35.270
<v Speaker 3>in their individual form,</v>

3374
01:56:35.271 --> 01:56:36.210
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>

3375
01:56:36.510 --> 01:56:38.370
<v Speaker 3>well at least harmless.</v>

3376
01:56:38.380 --> 01:56:39.600
<v Speaker 3>Even though they're not,</v>

3377
01:56:39.660 --> 01:56:43.860
<v Speaker 3>they seem at least harvest and they ha they have the mask of even something that</v>

3378
01:56:43.861 --> 01:56:45.270
<v Speaker 3>appears to be beneficial.</v>

3379
01:56:45.690 --> 01:56:48.620
<v Speaker 3>Now I think of all the pathological ideas on the left,</v>

3380
01:56:48.900 --> 01:56:51.150
<v Speaker 3>the most dangerous is equity.</v>

3381
01:56:51.540 --> 01:56:55.290
<v Speaker 3>I would say when people start talking about equality of outcome,</v>

3382
01:56:56.130 --> 01:57:01.130
<v Speaker 3>they've crossed the Rubicon and then it's incumbent on reasonable people in the</v>

3383
01:57:01.501 --> 01:57:06.501
<v Speaker 3>center and on the left can point that out and dissociate themselves from them</v>

3384
01:57:06.750 --> 01:57:09.690
<v Speaker 3>and they're not doing it and it's not good.</v>

3385
01:57:10.220 --> 01:57:11.053
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

3386
01:57:16.130 --> 01:57:18.980
<v Speaker 3>If only there was someone that came from the left that had been trying to do</v>

3387
01:57:18.981 --> 01:57:19.221
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3388
01:57:19.221 --> 01:57:20.150
<v Speaker 3>but his past couple of years,</v>

3389
01:57:22.510 --> 01:57:23.343
<v Speaker 1>Ruben.</v>

3390
01:57:29.070 --> 01:57:33.650
<v Speaker 4>All right to say I gave up three hours of gameplay play.</v>

3391
01:57:34.350 --> 01:57:35.183
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3392
01:57:40.370 --> 01:57:41.780
<v Speaker 3>and it's questions about Zelda.</v>

3393
01:57:43.420 --> 01:57:43.940
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3394
01:57:43.940 --> 01:57:47.720
<v Speaker 4>Here's an interesting spin off from the Jq that I've been pondering on recently.</v>

3395
01:57:48.110 --> 01:57:52.280
<v Speaker 4>How do we solve nepotism and [inaudible] preferences in groups as the majority</v>

3396
01:57:52.281 --> 01:57:53.690
<v Speaker 4>of the power and influence?</v>

3397
01:57:53.930 --> 01:57:55.640
<v Speaker 4>Is it even a problem at all?</v>

3398
01:57:56.030 --> 01:57:56.631
<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>

3399
01:57:56.631 --> 01:57:58.340
<v Speaker 4>this doesn't have to do anything with Rice.</v>

3400
01:57:58.341 --> 01:57:59.960
<v Speaker 4>Any differential factor can,</v>

3401
01:58:00.100 --> 01:58:00.491
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3402
01:58:00.491 --> 01:58:01.324
<v Speaker 4>it can be used here.</v>

3403
01:58:02.970 --> 01:58:03.361
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3404
01:58:03.361 --> 01:58:05.910
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think that we solved the problem with nepotism.</v>

3405
01:58:05.911 --> 01:58:08.550
<v Speaker 3>The way that we have essentially solved it in the west.</v>

3406
01:58:09.140 --> 01:58:09.570
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3407
01:58:09.570 --> 01:58:11.310
<v Speaker 3>our bureaucracies for example,</v>

3408
01:58:11.311 --> 01:58:13.290
<v Speaker 3>are basically meritocratic.</v>

3409
01:58:13.880 --> 01:58:14.160
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3410
01:58:14.160 --> 01:58:14.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3411
01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:17.700
<v Speaker 3>measuring merit is no simple thing,</v>

3412
01:58:17.790 --> 01:58:18.091
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3413
01:58:18.091 --> 01:58:21.840
<v Speaker 3>Because it's not easy to establish a measurement that actually has a decent</v>

3414
01:58:21.841 --> 01:58:23.700
<v Speaker 3>correlation with the desired outcome.</v>

3415
01:58:23.850 --> 01:58:24.571
<v Speaker 3>If it was easy,</v>

3416
01:58:24.571 --> 01:58:26.610
<v Speaker 3>everybody could set up a successful business,</v>

3417
01:58:26.670 --> 01:58:28.080
<v Speaker 3>it's actually very difficult.</v>

3418
01:58:28.290 --> 01:58:29.400
<v Speaker 3>But we have decided,</v>

3419
01:58:29.850 --> 01:58:32.850
<v Speaker 3>imagine that managing your institution has a function.</v>

3420
01:58:33.510 --> 01:58:34.140
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3421
01:58:34.140 --> 01:58:36.420
<v Speaker 3>Which you know is not so difficult to imagine.</v>

3422
01:58:36.930 --> 01:58:39.540
<v Speaker 3>And then imagine people differ in that function,</v>

3423
01:58:39.570 --> 01:58:41.890
<v Speaker 3>which obviously they will then imagine,</v>

3424
01:58:41.950 --> 01:58:44.470
<v Speaker 3>imagine you could measure those differences.</v>

3425
01:58:44.850 --> 01:58:45.880
<v Speaker 3>Now we kind of do that.</v>

3426
01:58:45.881 --> 01:58:46.780
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

3427
01:58:46.900 --> 01:58:48.160
<v Speaker 3>if you're applying to university,</v>

3428
01:58:48.161 --> 01:58:53.161
<v Speaker 3>you might have to take the sat because we know that sat scores roughly sample</v>

3429
01:58:53.481 --> 01:58:57.340
<v Speaker 3>the same competence domain that university does now.</v>

3430
01:58:57.340 --> 01:58:59.200
<v Speaker 3>It's not perfect by any stretch.</v>

3431
01:58:59.201 --> 01:58:59.561
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

3432
01:58:59.561 --> 01:59:04.090
<v Speaker 3>the correlation between her sat scores and grades is about 0.4 or something like</v>

3433
01:59:04.091 --> 01:59:04.361
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3434
01:59:04.361 --> 01:59:09.361
<v Speaker 3>So leaves about 85% 70% let's say of the variance unexplained,</v>

3435
01:59:11.340 --> 01:59:12.250
<v Speaker 3>but it's on [inaudible],</v>

3436
01:59:12.300 --> 01:59:15.850
<v Speaker 3>active and neutral and it's the best that we've got.</v>

3437
01:59:16.030 --> 01:59:17.980
<v Speaker 3>And so that's what you do is you reduce people,</v>

3438
01:59:17.981 --> 01:59:20.500
<v Speaker 3>the individuals first of all and then you say,</v>

3439
01:59:20.501 --> 01:59:20.711
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3440
01:59:20.711 --> 01:59:25.030
<v Speaker 3>we're going to assist you in accordance with your competence in relationship to</v>

3441
01:59:25.031 --> 01:59:27.010
<v Speaker 3>the function of this organization had.</v>

3442
01:59:27.011 --> 01:59:28.690
<v Speaker 3>That's all we're going to do.</v>

3443
01:59:29.440 --> 01:59:31.650
<v Speaker 3>We do that quite well now it's,</v>

3444
01:59:31.660 --> 01:59:33.790
<v Speaker 3>it's very difficult if we can't do it perfectly,</v>

3445
01:59:33.791 --> 01:59:38.791
<v Speaker 3>but there isn't a better solution and to to substitute instead like quotas for</v>

3446
01:59:40.781 --> 01:59:42.520
<v Speaker 3>race and sex is,</v>

3447
01:59:42.730 --> 01:59:45.220
<v Speaker 3>well it's impossibly dangerous.</v>

3448
01:59:45.670 --> 01:59:50.200
<v Speaker 3>It promotes us into the identity politics realm and that's subject gates,</v>

3449
01:59:50.201 --> 01:59:53.690
<v Speaker 3>the individual to the group and that's fine if you want like on travel</v>

3450
01:59:53.691 --> 01:59:54.524
<v Speaker 3>tribalism,</v>

3451
01:59:54.820 --> 01:59:55.600
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3452
01:59:55.600 --> 01:59:56.433
<v Speaker 3>go for it.</v>

3453
01:59:56.900 --> 02:00:00.790
<v Speaker 3>But we know where as elite it leads to,</v>

3454
02:00:01.360 --> 02:00:02.350
<v Speaker 3>it leads to death.</v>

3455
02:00:03.160 --> 02:00:05.350
<v Speaker 3>That's where it leads and maybe that's what you want.</v>

3456
02:00:11.220 --> 02:00:13.280
<v Speaker 3>Why don't we try one one up in the second?</v>

3457
02:00:13.281 --> 02:00:14.114
<v Speaker 3>Anyone over there,</v>

3458
02:00:15.970 --> 02:00:16.930
<v Speaker 1>right there.</v>

3459
02:00:18.590 --> 02:00:19.423
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3460
02:00:26.260 --> 02:00:26.980
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

3461
02:00:26.980 --> 02:00:27.940
<v Speaker 1>Can you talk to any,</v>

3462
02:00:27.970 --> 02:00:32.970
<v Speaker 1>is there any benefits or the negative emotion in your role or is it just let me</v>

3463
02:00:33.351 --> 02:00:34.184
<v Speaker 1>someone else.</v>

3464
02:00:35.460 --> 02:00:35.791
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

3465
02:00:35.791 --> 02:00:37.890
<v Speaker 3>so then the question is the gentleman,</v>

3466
02:00:37.891 --> 02:00:41.310
<v Speaker 3>who else the question said he took my personality test and scored rather high in</v>

3467
02:00:41.311 --> 02:00:44.460
<v Speaker 3>neuroticism and asked if there was any benefit to that.</v>

3468
02:00:49.410 --> 02:00:50.243
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3469
02:00:50.250 --> 02:00:50.501
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3470
02:00:50.501 --> 02:00:51.360
<v Speaker 3>the answer is,</v>

3471
02:00:51.390 --> 02:00:53.880
<v Speaker 3>the answer is it's a normal distribution,</v>

3472
02:00:54.270 --> 02:00:54.570
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3473
02:00:54.570 --> 02:00:58.380
<v Speaker 3>And so sometimes if you're terrified out of your skull and hiding in the</v>

3474
02:00:58.381 --> 02:00:58.921
<v Speaker 3>basement,</v>

3475
02:00:58.921 --> 02:01:02.040
<v Speaker 3>then the king's tyrants don't cut off your head.</v>

3476
02:01:02.910 --> 02:01:03.211
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3477
02:01:03.211 --> 02:01:06.480
<v Speaker 3>So there are times when the environment is so dangerous that you should be</v>

3478
02:01:06.481 --> 02:01:08.670
<v Speaker 3>terrified all the time and high.</v>

3479
02:01:09.560 --> 02:01:12.240
<v Speaker 3>Like lots of human environments are like that.</v>

3480
02:01:12.270 --> 02:01:12.910
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3481
02:01:12.910 --> 02:01:13.231
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3482
02:01:13.231 --> 02:01:13.410
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

3483
02:01:13.410 --> 02:01:14.243
<v Speaker 3>in many,</v>

3484
02:01:14.590 --> 02:01:14.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3485
02:01:14.940 --> 02:01:15.151
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

3486
02:01:15.151 --> 02:01:16.770
<v Speaker 3>in a western culture you might think,</v>

3487
02:01:16.771 --> 02:01:16.951
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3488
02:01:16.951 --> 02:01:20.430
<v Speaker 3>extroverted and emotionally stable is a pretty good solution.</v>

3489
02:01:20.640 --> 02:01:22.140
<v Speaker 3>Fair bit of positive emotion,</v>

3490
02:01:22.380 --> 02:01:25.650
<v Speaker 3>fair bit of verbal assertiveness nor too much fear.</v>

3491
02:01:25.680 --> 02:01:26.513
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3492
02:01:26.520 --> 02:01:26.701
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3493
02:01:26.701 --> 02:01:28.860
<v Speaker 3>if you were like an extroverted,</v>

3494
02:01:29.100 --> 02:01:32.730
<v Speaker 3>extroverted and emotionally stable in 1930s in the Soviet Union,</v>

3495
02:01:32.731 --> 02:01:33.330
<v Speaker 3>you were like,</v>

3496
02:01:33.330 --> 02:01:34.163
<v Speaker 3>damn,</v>

3497
02:01:35.090 --> 02:01:35.401
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>

3498
02:01:35.401 --> 02:01:35.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3499
02:01:35.630 --> 02:01:38.850
<v Speaker 3>Because like if you're introverted and terrified,</v>

3500
02:01:39.130 --> 02:01:41.420
<v Speaker 3>then maybe you will be killed.</v>

3501
02:01:42.110 --> 02:01:46.550
<v Speaker 3>So it's brutal because you have to put up with the neuroticism,</v>

3502
02:01:46.551 --> 02:01:46.730
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3503
02:01:46.730 --> 02:01:49.700
<v Speaker 3>You have to put up with the anxiety and maybe with the volatility as well.</v>

3504
02:01:49.701 --> 02:01:51.950
<v Speaker 3>But in a hyper dangerous environment,</v>

3505
02:01:51.951 --> 02:01:53.270
<v Speaker 3>it's inappropriate strategy.</v>

3506
02:01:54.140 --> 02:01:55.940
<v Speaker 3>So now having said that,</v>

3507
02:01:55.950 --> 02:02:00.020
<v Speaker 3>I would also say that if you're neuroticism levels are extremely elevated,</v>

3508
02:02:00.021 --> 02:02:04.040
<v Speaker 3>then there's some possibility that you have an anxiety disorder or that you're</v>

3509
02:02:04.041 --> 02:02:06.800
<v Speaker 3>depressed or that there's something wrong with you physically that you might</v>

3510
02:02:06.801 --> 02:02:08.000
<v Speaker 3>want to get checked out.</v>

3511
02:02:08.360 --> 02:02:12.290
<v Speaker 3>So because there's lots of reasons to be upset and unhappy and some of them are</v>

3512
02:02:12.291 --> 02:02:13.041
<v Speaker 3>temperamental,</v>

3513
02:02:13.041 --> 02:02:13.281
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3514
02:02:13.281 --> 02:02:14.450
<v Speaker 3>that's just how you're wired.</v>

3515
02:02:14.451 --> 02:02:16.940
<v Speaker 3>And you can detect that in kids as early as six months.</v>

3516
02:02:17.270 --> 02:02:19.920
<v Speaker 3>But sometimes it's a secondary consequence of you know,</v>

3517
02:02:20.150 --> 02:02:22.400
<v Speaker 3>other things that have happened in your life or,</v>

3518
02:02:22.401 --> 02:02:22.910
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

3519
02:02:22.910 --> 02:02:24.200
<v Speaker 3>or general ill health.</v>

3520
02:02:24.800 --> 02:02:28.880
<v Speaker 3>So I also think I've been puzzling for a long time over why women have higher</v>

3521
02:02:28.881 --> 02:02:30.890
<v Speaker 3>levels of negative emotion than men.</v>

3522
02:02:31.310 --> 02:02:32.150
<v Speaker 3>And I think,</v>

3523
02:02:32.210 --> 02:02:34.010
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a couple of reasons for it.</v>

3524
02:02:34.190 --> 02:02:35.300
<v Speaker 3>It kicks in at puberty,</v>

3525
02:02:35.301 --> 02:02:35.721
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

3526
02:02:35.721 --> 02:02:37.340
<v Speaker 3>because it isn't true for boys and girls,</v>

3527
02:02:37.341 --> 02:02:41.510
<v Speaker 3>but it is true for adult men and women and it's true throughout the lifespan.</v>

3528
02:02:42.130 --> 02:02:45.710
<v Speaker 3>I think the reason for it is is that the world's actually more objectively</v>

3529
02:02:45.711 --> 02:02:47.990
<v Speaker 3>dangerous to women at an individual level,</v>

3530
02:02:48.170 --> 02:02:50.980
<v Speaker 3>partly because they're sexually vulnerable and also partly because they're</v>

3531
02:02:50.990 --> 02:02:51.890
<v Speaker 3>physically smaller,</v>

3532
02:02:52.430 --> 02:02:54.830
<v Speaker 3>so it makes sense that they'd be more nervous,</v>

3533
02:02:55.070 --> 02:02:59.300
<v Speaker 3>but then also I think women are more sensitive to negative emotion because they</v>

3534
02:02:59.301 --> 02:03:03.200
<v Speaker 3>have to be sensitive to the distress of India of infants because it isn't</v>

3535
02:03:03.201 --> 02:03:07.190
<v Speaker 3>obvious to me at all that female nervous systems are adapted for the individual</v>

3536
02:03:07.191 --> 02:03:07.910
<v Speaker 3>female.</v>

3537
02:03:07.910 --> 02:03:11.960
<v Speaker 3>I think they're probably adapted for the infant mother dyad and you're a lot</v>

3538
02:03:11.961 --> 02:03:15.320
<v Speaker 3>more vulnerable as an infant mother diet than you are as an individual.</v>

3539
02:03:15.620 --> 02:03:16.580
<v Speaker 3>But I mean you have to be,</v>

3540
02:03:17.030 --> 02:03:17.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3541
02:03:17.690 --> 02:03:18.920
<v Speaker 3>if you're a good mother,</v>

3542
02:03:19.160 --> 02:03:21.260
<v Speaker 3>especially of really young infants,</v>

3543
02:03:21.560 --> 02:03:24.100
<v Speaker 3>you know when your infant is sleeping and wakes up,</v>

3544
02:03:24.120 --> 02:03:25.130
<v Speaker 3>goes beep,</v>

3545
02:03:25.190 --> 02:03:30.190
<v Speaker 3>you're a right response is to jump out of bed awake and alert and go likely</v>

3546
02:03:30.291 --> 02:03:34.940
<v Speaker 3>nurse the infant and you have to be on a hair trigger essentially to be that</v>

3547
02:03:34.970 --> 02:03:35.803
<v Speaker 3>sensitive.</v>

3548
02:03:36.020 --> 02:03:36.890
<v Speaker 3>Well you pay a price.</v>

3549
02:03:36.950 --> 02:03:38.120
<v Speaker 3>Like if you think about it,</v>

3550
02:03:38.121 --> 02:03:40.970
<v Speaker 3>you pay a price for being sensitive to your infant.</v>

3551
02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:42.920
<v Speaker 3>Why the hell wouldn't you pay a price for that?</v>

3552
02:03:42.950 --> 02:03:45.740
<v Speaker 3>Cause it's really like infants are a lot of work.</v>

3553
02:03:45.770 --> 02:03:47.180
<v Speaker 3>They require a lot of care.</v>

3554
02:03:47.240 --> 02:03:48.950
<v Speaker 3>You have to be super attentive to them.</v>

3555
02:03:48.951 --> 02:03:50.630
<v Speaker 3>They're unbelievably dependent.</v>

3556
02:03:50.990 --> 02:03:54.530
<v Speaker 3>And so to be wired for that means you're going to pay a price.</v>

3557
02:03:54.800 --> 02:03:58.520
<v Speaker 3>Like maybe it's going to be harder for you to deal with adult males because</v>

3558
02:03:58.550 --> 02:04:00.890
<v Speaker 3>you're more sensitive to the distress of infants.</v>

3559
02:04:00.950 --> 02:04:02.060
<v Speaker 3>Highly probable.</v>

3560
02:04:02.450 --> 02:04:03.920
<v Speaker 3>So these things are</v>

3561
02:04:05.080 --> 02:04:05.260
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

3562
02:04:05.260 --> 02:04:07.540
<v Speaker 3>You'd never get an advantage without paying a price.</v>

3563
02:04:07.570 --> 02:04:07.901
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

3564
02:04:07.901 --> 02:04:10.420
<v Speaker 3>that's basically the rule from a temperamental perspective</v>

3565
02:04:11.910 --> 02:04:12.743
<v Speaker 5>right here.</v>

3566
02:04:13.420 --> 02:04:14.350
<v Speaker 3>Adoptive Peterson.</v>

3567
02:04:14.530 --> 02:04:15.430
<v Speaker 3>My name's John Carlo,</v>

3568
02:04:15.470 --> 02:04:16.303
<v Speaker 3>Patelco.</v>

3569
02:04:16.570 --> 02:04:16.871
<v Speaker 3>First.</v>

3570
02:04:16.871 --> 02:04:20.590
<v Speaker 3>I just want to thank you so much for sharing the fruits of your suffering with</v>

3571
02:04:20.591 --> 02:04:22.600
<v Speaker 3>us and all of the work that you've done.</v>

3572
02:04:23.050 --> 02:04:23.771
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

3573
02:04:23.771 --> 02:04:24.461
<v Speaker 3>Appreciate it.</v>

3574
02:04:24.461 --> 02:04:25.660
<v Speaker 3>Thank you for doing that.</v>

3575
02:04:25.870 --> 02:04:26.201
<v Speaker 3>Sharing.</v>

3576
02:04:26.201 --> 02:04:28.780
<v Speaker 3>I guess my question is about technology.</v>

3577
02:04:28.781 --> 02:04:32.250
<v Speaker 3>I've been doing a lot of thinking about the role of technology in our evolution.</v>

3578
02:04:32.950 --> 02:04:37.950
<v Speaker 3>It's cert an amazing purpose in creating distance between us nature so that we</v>

3579
02:04:37.951 --> 02:04:39.960
<v Speaker 3>can survive and live longer.</v>

3580
02:04:40.310 --> 02:04:40.710
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3581
02:04:40.710 --> 02:04:44.340
<v Speaker 3>but it seems like we've reached a point of which technology is so deeply</v>

3582
02:04:44.341 --> 02:04:49.341
<v Speaker 3>embedded in our lives that it is preventing us from living a more meaningful by,</v>

3583
02:04:50.340 --> 02:04:53.700
<v Speaker 3>and I'm thinking specifically of the fact that we now have these mobile devices</v>

3584
02:04:53.701 --> 02:04:54.540
<v Speaker 3>that are with us,</v>

3585
02:04:54.541 --> 02:04:57.810
<v Speaker 3>except when we were in the shower and when we're sleeping basically.</v>

3586
02:04:57.900 --> 02:04:59.440
<v Speaker 3>And now there are water provide phones.</v>

3587
02:04:59.450 --> 02:05:01.560
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know what's going to happen next,</v>

3588
02:05:01.561 --> 02:05:05.240
<v Speaker 3>but we have these phones with us all the time and they've got social media on</v>

3589
02:05:05.310 --> 02:05:05.580
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3590
02:05:05.580 --> 02:05:10.490
<v Speaker 3>It seems like it kind of addictive and distracting us from ourselves and our</v>

3591
02:05:10.491 --> 02:05:11.150
<v Speaker 3>lives.</v>

3592
02:05:11.150 --> 02:05:14.420
<v Speaker 3>And it's something that I'm exploring and working on and have transformed my</v>

3593
02:05:14.421 --> 02:05:16.100
<v Speaker 3>life by taking control over.</v>

3594
02:05:16.101 --> 02:05:17.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm wondering if you have thoughts about,</v>

3595
02:05:18.050 --> 02:05:18.440
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3596
02:05:18.440 --> 02:05:21.890
<v Speaker 3>the role of technology in our lives and if we've reached a turning point in some</v>

3597
02:05:21.891 --> 02:05:22.724
<v Speaker 3>ways.</v>

3598
02:05:22.730 --> 02:05:23.540
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3599
02:05:23.540 --> 02:05:23.931
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3600
02:05:23.931 --> 02:05:26.530
<v Speaker 3>I won't comment specifically on the cellphone.</v>

3601
02:05:27.110 --> 02:05:31.340
<v Speaker 3>I think the reason for that is that we're in a place where the rate of</v>

3602
02:05:31.341 --> 02:05:35.510
<v Speaker 3>technological transformation is so fast that the probability that cell phones</v>

3603
02:05:35.511 --> 02:05:38.210
<v Speaker 3>will still be the problem in 10 years is zero.</v>

3604
02:05:38.750 --> 02:05:39.171
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3605
02:05:39.171 --> 02:05:43.760
<v Speaker 3>It'll be something else and maybe something even more difficult to manage.</v>

3606
02:05:44.420 --> 02:05:45.253
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

3607
02:05:45.530 --> 02:05:45.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3608
02:05:45.840 --> 02:05:50.840
<v Speaker 3>I talked about this idea that this infinite landscape of potential is opening</v>

3609
02:05:51.231 --> 02:05:55.280
<v Speaker 3>itself up to us even more right now than it has in the past with his tremendous</v>

3610
02:05:55.281 --> 02:05:57.110
<v Speaker 3>rate of technological transformation.</v>

3611
02:05:57.740 --> 02:05:57.891
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3612
02:05:57.891 --> 02:05:58.850
<v Speaker 3>the question is,</v>

3613
02:05:58.970 --> 02:05:59.360
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

3614
02:05:59.360 --> 02:06:03.230
<v Speaker 3>the broader question that you have is how do we deal with this?</v>

3615
02:06:03.560 --> 02:06:04.820
<v Speaker 3>And that's a great question.</v>

3616
02:06:04.821 --> 02:06:08.360
<v Speaker 3>But I would say the answer to that is prepare yourself.</v>

3617
02:06:09.230 --> 02:06:09.830
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3618
02:06:09.830 --> 02:06:10.910
<v Speaker 3>because if I say,</v>

3619
02:06:10.940 --> 02:06:11.031
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3620
02:06:11.031 --> 02:06:11.390
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

3621
02:06:11.390 --> 02:06:12.260
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch,</v>

3622
02:06:12.530 --> 02:06:15.890
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot going to come at you in the next 10 years.</v>

3623
02:06:16.730 --> 02:06:19.370
<v Speaker 3>And there's no predicting what it's going to be.</v>

3624
02:06:19.430 --> 02:06:22.880
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be something that can be used for ill and something that can be</v>

3625
02:06:22.881 --> 02:06:23.840
<v Speaker 3>used for good.</v>

3626
02:06:24.230 --> 02:06:25.063
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3627
02:06:25.280 --> 02:06:26.660
<v Speaker 3>but we can't predict it.</v>

3628
02:06:26.690 --> 02:06:28.340
<v Speaker 3>So what should you do?</v>

3629
02:06:28.520 --> 02:06:31.040
<v Speaker 3>And the answer is you should prepare,</v>

3630
02:06:31.490 --> 02:06:31.760
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3631
02:06:31.760 --> 02:06:34.970
<v Speaker 3>You should eradicate your obvious weaknesses,</v>

3632
02:06:35.270 --> 02:06:36.920
<v Speaker 3>you should strengthen yourself,</v>

3633
02:06:36.950 --> 02:06:41.590
<v Speaker 3>you should become more alert and more educated and more disciplined and that,</v>

3634
02:06:41.650 --> 02:06:45.170
<v Speaker 3>and you'll do that in your own particular way and that will make you a better</v>

3635
02:06:45.171 --> 02:06:47.360
<v Speaker 3>whoever you are that you are now.</v>

3636
02:06:47.500 --> 02:06:48.770
<v Speaker 3>And as a collective,</v>

3637
02:06:48.771 --> 02:06:50.360
<v Speaker 3>that's the best we've got because,</v>

3638
02:06:50.650 --> 02:06:50.850
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3639
02:06:50.850 --> 02:06:52.670
<v Speaker 3>and I mean this is a really deep level.</v>

3640
02:06:53.150 --> 02:06:57.920
<v Speaker 3>We have become a planetary transforming force and that's probably really been</v>

3641
02:06:57.921 --> 02:06:59.510
<v Speaker 3>true since the end of World War II.</v>

3642
02:06:59.570 --> 02:06:59.840
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3643
02:06:59.840 --> 02:07:01.400
<v Speaker 3>When we invented the hydrogen bomb,</v>

3644
02:07:01.420 --> 02:07:03.250
<v Speaker 3>it was like that was a,</v>

3645
02:07:03.320 --> 02:07:05.120
<v Speaker 3>that was a whole new thing.</v>

3646
02:07:05.630 --> 02:07:10.630
<v Speaker 3>And we obviously have to develop the wisdom that will enable us to manage that</v>

3647
02:07:12.230 --> 02:07:15.650
<v Speaker 3>because what else are we going to do otherwise we're infants with,</v>

3648
02:07:15.890 --> 02:07:16.970
<v Speaker 3>with guns.</v>

3649
02:07:17.660 --> 02:07:20.060
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things I learned from Carl,</v>

3650
02:07:20.070 --> 02:07:21.440
<v Speaker 3>you know what I really liked,</v>

3651
02:07:21.500 --> 02:07:22.410
<v Speaker 3>I really liked this,</v>

3652
02:07:22.411 --> 02:07:25.040
<v Speaker 3>is he was very interested in Alchemy,</v>

3653
02:07:25.850 --> 02:07:28.940
<v Speaker 3>which was a weird ad mixture of ethics,</v>

3654
02:07:28.941 --> 02:07:30.420
<v Speaker 3>religion and produce.</v>

3655
02:07:30.421 --> 02:07:32.900
<v Speaker 3>Science is the birthplace is science.</v>

3656
02:07:33.350 --> 02:07:37.570
<v Speaker 3>And it was kind of a dream and the was that human beings could investigate the</v>

3657
02:07:37.571 --> 02:07:40.420
<v Speaker 3>material world and generate the philosopher's stone,</v>

3658
02:07:40.450 --> 02:07:42.100
<v Speaker 3>which would make everybody healthy,</v>

3659
02:07:42.280 --> 02:07:43.113
<v Speaker 3>wealthy,</v>

3660
02:07:43.330 --> 02:07:44.163
<v Speaker 3>immortal.</v>

3661
02:07:44.170 --> 02:07:45.010
<v Speaker 3>But there was a dream.</v>

3662
02:07:45.011 --> 02:07:45.241
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>

3663
02:07:45.241 --> 02:07:49.690
<v Speaker 3>the dream was we could discover that by investigating the material world.</v>

3664
02:07:49.780 --> 02:07:52.000
<v Speaker 3>And that was the impetus for the development of science.</v>

3665
02:07:52.180 --> 02:07:52.301
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3666
02:07:52.301 --> 02:07:53.710
<v Speaker 3>that took off like mad.</v>

3667
02:07:53.890 --> 02:07:58.060
<v Speaker 3>And in some sense we have discovered the philosopher's stone.</v>

3668
02:07:58.690 --> 02:07:59.740
<v Speaker 3>We are much healthier,</v>

3669
02:07:59.741 --> 02:08:00.730
<v Speaker 3>we lived much longer,</v>

3670
02:08:00.731 --> 02:08:01.810
<v Speaker 3>were far richer,</v>

3671
02:08:02.050 --> 02:08:03.400
<v Speaker 3>and that was all a consequence of,</v>

3672
02:08:03.620 --> 02:08:04.140
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

3673
02:08:04.140 --> 02:08:06.070
<v Speaker 3>of investigating the material world.</v>

3674
02:08:06.071 --> 02:08:10.210
<v Speaker 3>But there was a lot of religious and ethical thinking that was part and parcel</v>

3675
02:08:10.211 --> 02:08:11.560
<v Speaker 3>of the l chemical dream.</v>

3676
02:08:11.710 --> 02:08:14.110
<v Speaker 3>And it didn't grow the same way.</v>

3677
02:08:14.440 --> 02:08:18.410
<v Speaker 3>And so it's like we're stuck ethically in like 1600 and we're,</v>

3678
02:08:18.450 --> 02:08:20.260
<v Speaker 3>and technologically it's,</v>

3679
02:08:20.290 --> 02:08:23.380
<v Speaker 3>it's the 21st century and that's not good enough.</v>

3680
02:08:23.620 --> 02:08:27.910
<v Speaker 3>We have to become as powerful as quickly as we are scientifically or,</v>

3681
02:08:27.911 --> 02:08:29.350
<v Speaker 3>or we'll do ourselves in.</v>

3682
02:08:30.250 --> 02:08:31.630
<v Speaker 3>So that,</v>

3683
02:08:31.631 --> 02:08:35.860
<v Speaker 3>and I think that's part of what we're trying to sort out is what's our ethical</v>

3684
02:08:35.861 --> 02:08:36.760
<v Speaker 3>responsibility?</v>

3685
02:08:36.790 --> 02:08:40.300
<v Speaker 3>How good could we become as individuals and where could that take us if we</v>

3686
02:08:40.301 --> 02:08:41.680
<v Speaker 3>decide to go there?</v>

3687
02:08:41.920 --> 02:08:42.753
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3688
02:08:42.760 --> 02:08:47.760
<v Speaker 3>and cell phones are one small but significant element of that credibly powerful</v>

3689
02:08:50.321 --> 02:08:51.154
<v Speaker 3>devices,</v>

3690
02:08:51.490 --> 02:08:56.470
<v Speaker 3>but requiring wisdom in their management and that's just going to get worse</v>

3691
02:08:56.471 --> 02:09:00.220
<v Speaker 3>because there are things coming down the pipes technologically that we can,</v>

3692
02:09:00.280 --> 02:09:01.390
<v Speaker 3>we can't even imagine.</v>

3693
02:09:02.160 --> 02:09:03.340
<v Speaker 3>So thank you so much.</v>

3694
02:09:17.200 --> 02:09:17.570
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3695
02:09:17.570 --> 02:09:18.560
<v Speaker 6>it's the antidote.</v>

3696
02:09:19.030 --> 02:09:20.630
<v Speaker 6>It's the justification.</v>

3697
02:09:21.560 --> 02:09:22.910
<v Speaker 6>It's not a distraction.</v>

3698
02:09:23.330 --> 02:09:26.930
<v Speaker 6>It can't be a distraction because if it's a distraction and it just,</v>

3699
02:09:27.200 --> 02:09:28.033
<v Speaker 6>it won't work.</v>

3700
02:09:28.190 --> 02:09:28.580
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3701
02:09:28.580 --> 02:09:31.130
<v Speaker 6>generally people distract themselves with trivialities,</v>

3702
02:09:31.530 --> 02:09:31.951
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3703
02:09:31.951 --> 02:09:32.200
<v Speaker 6>with,</v>

3704
02:09:32.200 --> 02:09:32.740
<v Speaker 6>with,</v>

3705
02:09:32.740 --> 02:09:33.350
<v Speaker 6>with cheap,</v>

3706
02:09:33.350 --> 02:09:34.940
<v Speaker 6>impulsive entertainment.</v>

3707
02:09:35.180 --> 02:09:37.430
<v Speaker 6>And I don't have anything against even cheap,</v>

3708
02:09:37.431 --> 02:09:38.990
<v Speaker 6>impulsive entertainment for that matter.</v>

3709
02:09:39.050 --> 02:09:41.190
<v Speaker 6>But it's not,</v>

3710
02:09:41.360 --> 02:09:43.460
<v Speaker 6>it's not something that you do well.</v>

3711
02:09:43.461 --> 02:09:46.640
<v Speaker 6>You're busily suffering yourself into extinction.</v>

3712
02:09:46.770 --> 02:09:49.510
<v Speaker 6>It's like I do believe that I,</v>

3713
02:09:49.630 --> 02:09:51.590
<v Speaker 6>and I believe that there's evidence for this,</v>

3714
02:09:51.591 --> 02:09:56.170
<v Speaker 6>that that instinct of meaning is the deepest instinct that you have and it</v>

3715
02:09:56.180 --> 02:09:58.700
<v Speaker 6>actually does orient you to the proper place.</v>

3716
02:09:58.790 --> 02:09:59.690
<v Speaker 6>Whatever that means.</v>

3717
02:10:00.160 --> 02:10:04.640
<v Speaker 6>It means something biological that means something political.</v>

3718
02:10:04.641 --> 02:10:05.900
<v Speaker 6>It means something economic.</v>

3719
02:10:05.901 --> 02:10:09.920
<v Speaker 6>But I think it means something universal as well because I do think that</v>

3720
02:10:09.921 --> 02:10:12.330
<v Speaker 6>consciousness plays a central role in being.</v>

3721
02:10:12.950 --> 02:10:16.310
<v Speaker 6>And so if you orient yourself towards what's meaningful,</v>

3722
02:10:16.311 --> 02:10:19.820
<v Speaker 6>then you participate in all those levels at the same time.</v>

3723
02:10:20.360 --> 02:10:22.580
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what the ultimate significance of that is,</v>

3724
02:10:22.581 --> 02:10:26.450
<v Speaker 6>but I suppose it's the same as the ultimate significance of reality itself.</v>

3725
02:10:27.290 --> 02:10:29.510
<v Speaker 6>But there's something profound too.</v>

3726
02:10:29.990 --> 02:10:31.670
<v Speaker 6>It's not just a distraction by any.</v>

3727
02:10:32.020 --> 02:10:33.800
<v Speaker 6>Like I don't think we're away.</v>

3728
02:10:33.801 --> 02:10:35.030
<v Speaker 6>We'll Rome burns.</v>

3729
02:10:35.480 --> 02:10:39.560
<v Speaker 6>I don't think you find pleasant occupations to preoccupy yourself while you,</v>

3730
02:10:39.800 --> 02:10:41.360
<v Speaker 6>while you trudge towards death.</v>

3731
02:10:41.870 --> 02:10:42.703
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3732
02:10:42.740 --> 02:10:43.580
<v Speaker 6>it's not like that.</v>

3733
02:10:43.880 --> 02:10:44.713
<v Speaker 6>It's</v>

3734
02:10:45.900 --> 02:10:48.920
<v Speaker 6>the orientation towards meeting is a fundamental reality.</v>

3735
02:10:48.980 --> 02:10:53.330
<v Speaker 6>You're neurologically wired and so it's real.</v>

3736
02:10:53.930 --> 02:10:55.640
<v Speaker 6>Now what that means ultimately,</v>

3737
02:10:55.700 --> 02:10:56.241
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

3738
02:10:56.241 --> 02:10:59.720
<v Speaker 6>But one thing I do know that it means is that it means less hell.</v>

3739
02:11:00.710 --> 02:11:01.880
<v Speaker 6>And that's something,</v>

3740
02:11:01.940 --> 02:11:02.330
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

3741
02:11:02.330 --> 02:11:06.080
<v Speaker 6>Really that's something so we could start with that and see where it goes.</v>

3742
02:11:06.730 --> 02:11:07.563
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3743
02:11:10.930 --> 02:11:11.300
<v Speaker 6>sure.</v>

3744
02:11:11.300 --> 02:11:12.111
<v Speaker 6>If you stand up to it,</v>

3745
02:11:12.111 --> 02:11:12.944
<v Speaker 6>everybody can hear you,</v>

3746
02:11:12.950 --> 02:11:13.783
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3747
02:11:14.340 --> 02:11:15.173
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3748
02:11:18.930 --> 02:11:20.470
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to want to university CME.</v>

3749
02:11:20.810 --> 02:11:22.050
<v Speaker 6>And your lack of it.</v>

3750
02:11:22.060 --> 02:11:25.790
<v Speaker 6>Part of the reason why I decided to make my intended major neuroscience.</v>

3751
02:11:25.870 --> 02:11:26.180
<v Speaker 6>Yup.</v>

3752
02:11:26.180 --> 02:11:27.070
<v Speaker 6>Kind of in if it's under,</v>

3753
02:11:27.080 --> 02:11:27.480
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

3754
02:11:27.480 --> 02:11:27.880
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

3755
02:11:27.880 --> 02:11:32.600
<v Speaker 6>And I was just wondering in terms of what the Canyon and psychologically works,</v>

3756
02:11:32.660 --> 02:11:33.620
<v Speaker 6>you know Floyd Young,</v>

3757
02:11:34.550 --> 02:11:37.960
<v Speaker 6>does it matter which order you read the books in or finish kind of getting</v>

3758
02:11:38.240 --> 02:11:40.100
<v Speaker 6>started with Rogers Rogers.</v>

3759
02:11:41.870 --> 02:11:42.703
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3760
02:11:42.980 --> 02:11:45.930
<v Speaker 6>Rogers is a very useful thing practically.</v>

3761
02:11:46.260 --> 02:11:47.390
<v Speaker 6>So that's Carl Rogers,</v>

3762
02:11:47.400 --> 02:11:48.290
<v Speaker 6>the psychotherapist.</v>

3763
02:11:48.500 --> 02:11:50.030
<v Speaker 6>I'd recommend his writings.</v>

3764
02:11:50.270 --> 02:11:52.010
<v Speaker 6>He wrote a book called the way of being,</v>

3765
02:11:52.310 --> 02:11:53.750
<v Speaker 6>which is a really great book.</v>

3766
02:11:54.100 --> 02:11:58.170
<v Speaker 6>Gary Rogers was a very practical person and I think a good person,</v>

3767
02:11:58.690 --> 02:11:59.730
<v Speaker 6>but it's,</v>

3768
02:12:00.170 --> 02:12:01.370
<v Speaker 6>it's very clear.</v>

3769
02:12:01.880 --> 02:12:02.713
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3770
02:12:03.890 --> 02:12:05.750
<v Speaker 6>Freud is harder and Yeoman.</v>

3771
02:12:05.780 --> 02:12:06.613
<v Speaker 6>Is it possible?</v>

3772
02:12:09.700 --> 02:12:10.700
<v Speaker 6>Very terrible.</v>

3773
02:12:12.020 --> 02:12:12.853
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>

3774
02:12:13.010 --> 02:12:14.120
<v Speaker 6>You don't want to start with that.</v>

3775
02:12:15.530 --> 02:12:16.070
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3776
02:12:16.070 --> 02:12:16.270
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

3777
02:12:16.270 --> 02:12:16.470
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

3778
02:12:16.470 --> 02:12:17.290
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

3779
02:12:17.290 --> 02:12:18.123
<v Speaker 6>That's advanced.</v>

3780
02:12:18.200 --> 02:12:18.770
<v Speaker 6>This.</v>

3781
02:12:18.770 --> 02:12:20.630
<v Speaker 6>That's partly why he didn't publish it.</v>

3782
02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:21.833
<v Speaker 6>He didn't publish.</v>

3783
02:12:22.790 --> 02:12:24.210
<v Speaker 6>So here's a reading list on my,</v>

3784
02:12:24.300 --> 02:12:25.133
<v Speaker 6>on my website.</v>

3785
02:12:25.320 --> 02:12:25.610
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

3786
02:12:25.610 --> 02:12:26.241
<v Speaker 6>The best thing,</v>

3787
02:12:26.241 --> 02:12:29.240
<v Speaker 6>if you're interested in cycle in psychological theory,</v>

3788
02:12:29.300 --> 02:12:30.260
<v Speaker 6>I think the best book,</v>

3789
02:12:30.830 --> 02:12:32.810
<v Speaker 6>likely especially psychoanalytic theory,</v>

3790
02:12:32.811 --> 02:12:35.390
<v Speaker 6>is a book called the discovery of the unconscious.</v>

3791
02:12:35.960 --> 02:12:39.100
<v Speaker 6>And then we'll give you an introduction to Freud and Jung and Adler and also did</v>

3792
02:12:39.101 --> 02:12:40.440
<v Speaker 6>the history of psychoanalytic thought.</v>

3793
02:12:40.640 --> 02:12:41.680
<v Speaker 6>It's a brilliant book.</v>

3794
02:12:41.940 --> 02:12:44.690
<v Speaker 6>It's really quite any gross Greek as well.</v>

3795
02:12:44.691 --> 02:12:46.280
<v Speaker 6>So that's a really good place to start.</v>

3796
02:12:46.610 --> 02:12:47.443
<v Speaker 6>We have time for,</v>

3797
02:12:47.870 --> 02:12:48.441
<v Speaker 6>thank you very much.</v>

3798
02:12:48.441 --> 02:12:49.274
<v Speaker 6>We have time for one.</v>

3799
02:12:49.280 --> 02:12:50.330
<v Speaker 6>One last question.</v>

3800
02:12:50.420 --> 02:12:51.040
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

3801
02:12:51.040 --> 02:12:51.750
<v Speaker 6>I'm your girl.</v>

3802
02:12:51.750 --> 02:12:52.470
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

3803
02:12:52.470 --> 02:12:53.120
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

3804
02:12:53.120 --> 02:12:54.050
<v Speaker 6>Who's the girl who's there?</v>

3805
02:12:54.500 --> 02:12:55.333
<v Speaker 6>All right.</v>

3806
02:12:55.560 --> 02:12:57.030
<v Speaker 7>You said recently that uh,</v>

3807
02:12:57.750 --> 02:13:00.450
<v Speaker 7>you'll never grow up and tell you how your own children,</v>

3808
02:13:00.600 --> 02:13:01.433
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

3809
02:13:01.560 --> 02:13:06.560
<v Speaker 7>Coming from a woman who doesn't have any children but is trying to sort herself</v>

3810
02:13:07.050 --> 02:13:11.370
<v Speaker 7>out and has mental issues in their history,</v>

3811
02:13:11.700 --> 02:13:12.420
<v Speaker 7>is it,</v>

3812
02:13:12.420 --> 02:13:16.620
<v Speaker 7>is it more important to sort yourself out and do the best you can and try to get</v>

3813
02:13:16.621 --> 02:13:17.940
<v Speaker 7>to adulthood in that way?</v>

3814
02:13:18.150 --> 02:13:20.430
<v Speaker 7>Or is it really necessary to have kids?</v>

3815
02:13:21.720 --> 02:13:22.430
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3816
02:13:22.430 --> 02:13:24.980
<v Speaker 6>this is something Carl Young said about psychotherapy.</v>

3817
02:13:25.100 --> 02:13:30.020
<v Speaker 6>He said that it can be replaced by a supreme moral effort because young like</v>

3818
02:13:30.021 --> 02:13:35.021
<v Speaker 6>most of the great knew that a lot of what d ranges people in their life is</v>

3819
02:13:35.460 --> 02:13:36.293
<v Speaker 6>falsehood.</v>

3820
02:13:36.360 --> 02:13:36.601
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3821
02:13:36.601 --> 02:13:41.601
<v Speaker 6>Freud talked about repression and Alfred Adler talked about the lifeline and</v>

3822
02:13:41.850 --> 02:13:43.050
<v Speaker 6>Carl Rogers talked about,</v>

3823
02:13:43.051 --> 02:13:43.410
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3824
02:13:43.410 --> 02:13:46.230
<v Speaker 6>anticipate and sort of the existential psychotherapist,</v>

3825
02:13:46.231 --> 02:13:46.830
<v Speaker 6>they all,</v>

3826
02:13:46.830 --> 02:13:50.760
<v Speaker 6>they all had their finger on the idea that just straighten yourself out as a</v>

3827
02:13:50.761 --> 02:13:51.594
<v Speaker 6>moral effort.</v>

3828
02:13:52.020 --> 02:13:57.020
<v Speaker 6>The thing about having kids that's telling is that if you have a child then it's</v>

3829
02:13:59.131 --> 02:14:03.930
<v Speaker 6>almost inevitable that you will then come to regard someone else as more</v>

3830
02:14:03.931 --> 02:14:04.890
<v Speaker 6>important than you.</v>

3831
02:14:05.760 --> 02:14:07.980
<v Speaker 6>And like I think you can do that.</v>

3832
02:14:08.340 --> 02:14:08.940
<v Speaker 6>Other ones,</v>

3833
02:14:08.940 --> 02:14:10.260
<v Speaker 6>there's other routes to that,</v>

3834
02:14:10.590 --> 02:14:11.610
<v Speaker 6>but they're hard.</v>

3835
02:14:12.200 --> 02:14:12.540
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3836
02:14:12.540 --> 02:14:14.090
<v Speaker 6>because the reason to,</v>

3837
02:14:14.091 --> 02:14:18.270
<v Speaker 6>anything that's a bigger commitment are there very few things that are a bigger</v>

3838
02:14:18.271 --> 02:14:20.250
<v Speaker 6>commitment than having a child.</v>

3839
02:14:20.820 --> 02:14:22.160
<v Speaker 6>And so it forces,</v>

3840
02:14:22.170 --> 02:14:26.280
<v Speaker 6>it catalyzes a change in you that you're entirely prepared for it.</v>

3841
02:14:26.670 --> 02:14:30.780
<v Speaker 6>And I think there are ways of doing that for people who don't have children,</v>

3842
02:14:31.450 --> 02:14:32.180
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

3843
02:14:32.180 --> 02:14:33.013
<v Speaker 6>but it's,</v>

3844
02:14:33.480 --> 02:14:34.710
<v Speaker 6>it's tar.</v>

3845
02:14:34.920 --> 02:14:35.531
<v Speaker 6>That's right.</v>

3846
02:14:35.531 --> 02:14:35.660
<v Speaker 6>It,</v>

3847
02:14:35.660 --> 02:14:36.000
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

3848
02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:37.650
<v Speaker 6>it requires the same sort of effort.</v>

3849
02:14:37.680 --> 02:14:39.840
<v Speaker 6>I wouldn't say that having a child requires,</v>

3850
02:14:39.841 --> 02:14:42.900
<v Speaker 6>which is a lot of effort to do so,</v>

3851
02:14:43.560 --> 02:14:45.840
<v Speaker 6>but I'm going to make statements like that.</v>

3852
02:14:45.841 --> 02:14:46.674
<v Speaker 6>They have to be,</v>

3853
02:14:47.430 --> 02:14:47.641
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3854
02:14:47.641 --> 02:14:48.360
<v Speaker 6>they're,</v>

3855
02:14:48.360 --> 02:14:49.193
<v Speaker 6>they're,</v>

3856
02:14:49.710 --> 02:14:50.280
<v Speaker 6>what are they?</v>

3857
02:14:50.280 --> 02:14:52.100
<v Speaker 6>They're crunchy and generalized.</v>

3858
02:14:52.620 --> 02:14:56.160
<v Speaker 6>And it's not to say that there are no people who are mature that don't have</v>

3859
02:14:56.161 --> 02:14:56.994
<v Speaker 6>children,</v>

3860
02:14:57.090 --> 02:15:01.020
<v Speaker 6>but this fastest and most certain way to maturity for people is to have a</v>

3861
02:15:01.021 --> 02:15:01.710
<v Speaker 6>chocolate.</v>

3862
02:15:01.710 --> 02:15:04.590
<v Speaker 6>That also doesn't mean that everyone who has a child becomes mature.</v>

3863
02:15:05.080 --> 02:15:07.650
<v Speaker 6>So because they don't generally,</v>

3864
02:15:07.651 --> 02:15:09.990
<v Speaker 6>they at least become more mature than they were,</v>

3865
02:15:10.050 --> 02:15:10.883
<v Speaker 6>which is something</v>

3866
02:15:13.140 --> 02:15:15.430
<v Speaker 6>we have to abandon theater.</v>

3867
02:15:16.200 --> 02:15:21.200
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
