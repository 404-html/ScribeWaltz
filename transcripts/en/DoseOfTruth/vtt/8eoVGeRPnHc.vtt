00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.290
<v Speaker 1>Did you please offer advice for</v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals with high intelligence but</v>

2
00:00:10.291 --> 00:00:13.680
<v Speaker 1>low extroversion and low agreeableness</v>
<v Speaker 1>and making and maintaining social</v>

3
00:00:13.681 --> 00:00:17.870
<v Speaker 1>connections and friendships?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:18.890
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's Roger,</v>

5
00:00:18.891 --> 00:00:20.060
<v Speaker 1>Roger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say</v>

6
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.880
<v Speaker 1>make a plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

7
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.660
<v Speaker 1>spend some time on it weekly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go to things like meetups.</v>

8
00:00:30.661 --> 00:00:34.050
<v Speaker 1>There's a site called meetup.com that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good place to meet people.</v>

9
00:00:34.051 --> 00:00:35.640
<v Speaker 1>Do whatever you have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meet people,</v>

10
00:00:35.641 --> 00:00:38.220
<v Speaker 1>take a course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strike up a conversation,</v>

11
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

12
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.180
<v Speaker 1>and ask questions and listen that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's particularly good.</v>

13
00:00:42.181 --> 00:00:44.390
<v Speaker 1>If you're low in agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

14
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.840
<v Speaker 1>people really like to be listened to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

15
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.350
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to pester them with</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions too badly,</v>

16
00:00:49.351 --> 00:00:53.070
<v Speaker 1>but you can get an awful long ways by</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to people and asking them</v>

17
00:00:53.071 --> 00:00:54.050
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

18
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.850
<v Speaker 1>people hardly ever get listened to and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're so damn help,</v>

19
00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.460
<v Speaker 1>happy when you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

20
00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:59.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

21
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.570
<v Speaker 1>that they're likely to open themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>up to you very,</v>

22
00:01:03.571 --> 00:01:07.200
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So get them talking.</v>

23
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.850
<v Speaker 1>And when they say something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't quite catch your understand,</v>

24
00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.070
<v Speaker 1>ask them about it and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that can help you move forward.</v>

25
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.370
<v Speaker 1>But put some time into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you need to be going out at least</v>

26
00:01:17.371 --> 00:01:18.870
<v Speaker 1>once a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

27
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.440
<v Speaker 1>and find some social places that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to regularly.</v>

28
00:01:22.441 --> 00:01:23.880
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.630
<v Speaker 1>was the pick a couple of hangouts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a local bar or something like that</v>

30
00:01:27.631 --> 00:01:30.690
<v Speaker 1>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But go there regularly and say hi to the</v>

31
00:01:30.691 --> 00:01:32.940
<v Speaker 1>people who own it and run it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then,</v>

32
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually you'll be irregular and then</v>

33
00:01:35.671 --> 00:01:37.560
<v Speaker 1>you can start to meet people by doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

34
00:01:37.561 --> 00:01:38.221
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:01:38.221 --> 00:01:40.560
<v Speaker 1>it might take you two or three years to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get good at it.</v>

36
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen people go to go from being</v>

37
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.260
<v Speaker 1>afraid to strike up a two to have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation with a friend in a,</v>

38
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.850
<v Speaker 1>in a coffee shop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

39
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.760
<v Speaker 1>like have a panic attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thinking about that to actually doing</v>

40
00:01:53.761 --> 00:01:57.150
<v Speaker 1>stand up comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can really move yourself along</v>

41
00:01:57.151 --> 00:01:59.370
<v Speaker 1>ways if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you make a long time plan.</v>
