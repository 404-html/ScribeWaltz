1
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.180
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to do well in a class and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a bad grade.</v>

2
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're in this little frame.</v>

3
00:00:09.271 --> 00:00:11.010
<v Speaker 1>You want to get a good grade that isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

4
00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:12.720
<v Speaker 1>He got a bad grade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

5
00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:16.500
<v Speaker 1>what is it that's manifesting itself as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bad grade?</v>

6
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:17.700
<v Speaker 1>While you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

7
00:00:17.701 --> 00:00:19.980
<v Speaker 1>it's a c minus on a piece of paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

8
00:00:19.981 --> 00:00:20.600
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

9
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really know that that's the objective</v>

10
00:00:23.881 --> 00:00:26.400
<v Speaker 1>manifestation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got a piece of paper with a c</v>

11
00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:30.690
<v Speaker 1>minus the value free proposition is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been delivered a piece of paper</v>

12
00:00:30.691 --> 00:00:32.370
<v Speaker 1>with a curve on it and a little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.290
<v Speaker 1>negative side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

14
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.300
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's what that is.</v>

15
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know it's,</v>

16
00:00:37.611 --> 00:00:40.440
<v Speaker 1>it's as dopey is thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well here you got your failing grade.</v>

17
00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:43.080
<v Speaker 1>You go into the lab and you like weigh</v>
<v Speaker 1>it on a scale.</v>

18
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.300
<v Speaker 1>Then you burn it and see what it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>made of.</v>

19
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:45.871
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

20
00:00:45.871 --> 00:00:48.240
<v Speaker 1>why did I get so upset about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just paper.</v>

21
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

22
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.510
<v Speaker 1>that's not just paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an entity that exists in a web of</v>

23
00:00:54.511 --> 00:00:57.480
<v Speaker 1>connections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that it signified by paper is</v>

24
00:00:57.481 --> 00:00:59.340
<v Speaker 1>almost completely irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

25
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.600
<v Speaker 1>The answer is you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why when you pick it up,</v>

26
00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:07.530
<v Speaker 1>you get this paralyzed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sinking feeling because your limbic</v>

27
00:01:07.531 --> 00:01:10.500
<v Speaker 1>system is a lot smarter than your</v>
<v Speaker 1>perceptual systems.</v>

28
00:01:10.501 --> 00:01:12.600
<v Speaker 1>And your perceptual systems say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

29
00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:14.580
<v Speaker 1>that's a piece of paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your limbic system says,</v>

30
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.280
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure dragon.</v>

31
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.440
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

32
00:01:19.441 --> 00:01:23.010
<v Speaker 1>And so then you're sweating and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you put it away and you go play</v>

33
00:01:23.011 --> 00:01:27.090
<v Speaker 1>video games because you know better the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothetical dragon,</v>

34
00:01:27.091 --> 00:01:30.720
<v Speaker 1>then the real dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so instead you pull out the piece of</v>

35
00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:32.190
<v Speaker 1>paper maybe and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

36
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.220
<v Speaker 1>why did I get this c minus?</v>

37
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a hell of a question,</v>

38
00:01:37.531 --> 00:01:38.610
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

39
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.370
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

40
00:01:41.371 --> 00:01:43.500
<v Speaker 1>that could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least stupid compared to who you</v>

41
00:01:43.501 --> 00:01:44.610
<v Speaker 1>think you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's,</v>

42
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.470
<v Speaker 1>that's the real horror that's lurking</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

43
00:01:46.471 --> 00:01:46.851
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

44
00:01:46.851 --> 00:01:48.090
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was kind of smart.</v>

45
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.180
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a proposition of the highest</v>

46
00:01:51.181 --> 00:01:53.310
<v Speaker 1>order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was kind of smart.</v>

47
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.971
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

48
00:01:53.971 --> 00:01:55.890
<v Speaker 1>well what about this c minus?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

49
00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.500
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that God damn professor,</v>

50
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.030
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the first thing.</v>

51
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.030
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's I've been attacked by a predator.</v>

52
00:02:03.031 --> 00:02:04.680
<v Speaker 1>That's the first response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

53
00:02:04.681 --> 00:02:06.390
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a nonsensical message.</v>

54
00:02:06.391 --> 00:02:08.610
<v Speaker 1>It's just delivered by someone evil and</v>
<v Speaker 1>predatory.</v>

55
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.890
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

56
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.380
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I wouldn't go there.</v>

57
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.590
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't go there first necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

58
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.810
<v Speaker 1>but then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then say you don't go there.</v>

59
00:02:18.811 --> 00:02:19.321
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

60
00:02:19.321 --> 00:02:23.310
<v Speaker 1>so what is this exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you not know what you thought you</v>

61
00:02:23.311 --> 00:02:24.144
<v Speaker 1>knew?</v>

62
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.390
<v Speaker 1>Are you not who you think you are?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you don't work hard enough?</v>

63
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.290
<v Speaker 1>Are Your values not organized properly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you misuse your time?</v>

64
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.310
<v Speaker 1>Are you in the wrong field?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have is the way you're construing Your</v>

65
00:02:35.311 --> 00:02:38.310
<v Speaker 1>Life Completely Inappropriate?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you acting out what your parents</v>

66
00:02:38.311 --> 00:02:40.350
<v Speaker 1>wanted you to do it and you're pissed</v>
<v Speaker 1>off about it.</v>

67
00:02:40.351 --> 00:02:43.770
<v Speaker 1>So you're only running at 40% to spite</v>
<v Speaker 1>them despite the fact that they're</v>

68
00:02:43.771 --> 00:02:46.530
<v Speaker 1>paying $25,000 a year for your</v>
<v Speaker 1>education.</v>

69
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.630
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's a fun game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

70
00:02:48.631 --> 00:02:52.080
<v Speaker 1>I'll go do what you want me to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll fail at.</v>

71
00:02:52.081 --> 00:02:55.410
<v Speaker 1>But not completely because then that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would wouldn't cost you very much.</v>

72
00:02:55.411 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>I'll just fail a little bit so that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to spend all that money forcing me</v>

73
00:02:59.981 --> 00:03:03.070
<v Speaker 1>to do what I don't want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you'll never get to escape from it.</v>

74
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.430
<v Speaker 1>And then every time we interact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll stab you in various ways that you</v>

75
00:03:06.431 --> 00:03:07.510
<v Speaker 1>don't quite understand.</v>

76
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.740
<v Speaker 1>Just to show you how irritated I am that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I happened to be acting out the destiny</v>

77
00:03:11.741 --> 00:03:15.130
<v Speaker 1>that you've put forward for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe that's part of the Dragon,</v>

78
00:03:15.131 --> 00:03:17.470
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that pulls in the whole parent</v>

79
00:03:17.471 --> 00:03:19.410
<v Speaker 1>thing and you know it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

80
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.090
<v Speaker 1>these are bottomless pits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Often when you,</v>

81
00:03:22.091 --> 00:03:25.090
<v Speaker 1>when you're in the world and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>something objects to you,</v>

82
00:03:25.091 --> 00:03:28.090
<v Speaker 1>something that matters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>objects to you,</v>

83
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.080
<v Speaker 1>then the in the entire unrealized world</v>
<v Speaker 1>is in that thing that objects,</v>

84
00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:35.110
<v Speaker 1>it's all tangled up inside it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's the great dragon of</v>

85
00:03:35.111 --> 00:03:37.630
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's everything that's outside of your</v>

86
00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:41.860
<v Speaker 1>conceptual structure and what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's everything that lurks outside of</v>

87
00:03:41.861 --> 00:03:43.720
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your walled city.</v>

88
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.020
<v Speaker 1>And it's manifested itself like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>snake in the garden.</v>

89
00:03:47.021 --> 00:03:50.470
<v Speaker 1>And the easiest thing to do is say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not having anything to do with that.</v>

90
00:03:50.471 --> 00:03:53.500
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

91
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.900
<v Speaker 1>you get your c minus and you don't do</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything about it.</v>

92
00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.870
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're a little bitter and more</v>
<v Speaker 1>resentful and your study habits get a</v>

93
00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:01.570
<v Speaker 1>little worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the next time you get like a d plus</v>

94
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.930
<v Speaker 1>and then you collect a bunch of F's and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you stopped going to school,</v>

95
00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.390
<v Speaker 1>then he stopped showering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

96
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.140
<v Speaker 1>Then you end up jumping off the bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's uh,</v>

97
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.460
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how the dragon eats you when you</v>

98
00:04:12.461 --> 00:04:15.670
<v Speaker 1>don't pay attention to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's no bloody wonder that people</v>

99
00:04:15.671 --> 00:04:16.750
<v Speaker 1>avoid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

100
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:21.640
<v Speaker 1>it's really no wonder that they avoid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because error messages contain within</v>

101
00:04:21.641 --> 00:04:26.641
<v Speaker 1>them the implicit world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the upside of that is while they</v>

102
00:04:26.711 --> 00:04:30.550
<v Speaker 1>contain within them the implicit world</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the world isn't all negative,</v>

103
00:04:30.551 --> 00:04:33.970
<v Speaker 1>and so maybe you get your c minus and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually the best gift you ever</v>

104
00:04:33.971 --> 00:04:37.360
<v Speaker 1>got because somebody finally took you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and went whack,</v>

105
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clue in.</v>

106
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.050
<v Speaker 1>And so you take that apart and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

107
00:04:41.051 --> 00:04:42.100
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to write.</v>

108
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never read anything in my life.</v>

109
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.440
<v Speaker 1>My study habits are a Bismal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

110
00:04:47.441 --> 00:04:50.080
<v Speaker 1>like maybe I'm working at 2% efficiency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

111
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.880
<v Speaker 1>which is probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would suspect that,</v>

112
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of you aren't doing that,</v>

113
00:04:53.861 --> 00:04:58.780
<v Speaker 1>but I bet you that I bet there's 30 30</v>
<v Speaker 1>to 50% of the people in the room are</v>

114
00:04:58.781 --> 00:05:01.240
<v Speaker 1>working at 2% efficiency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you got it.</v>

115
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.140
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

116
