1
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.740
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to briefly review some of what I told you last time and then I'm</v>

2
00:00:11.841 --> 00:00:13.730
<v Speaker 1>going to walk through,</v>

3
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.751
<v Speaker 1>as I mentioned,</v>

4
00:00:14.751 --> 00:00:19.751
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to walk through the Disney Film Pinocchio and which I presume most of</v>

5
00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:20.834
<v Speaker 1>you have seen.</v>

6
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:22.400
<v Speaker 1>How many have you seen it?</v>

7
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:24.081
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

8
00:00:24.081 --> 00:00:24.740
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

9
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:25.190
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

10
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.410
<v Speaker 1>that's so as I think I mentioned,</v>

11
00:00:27.411 --> 00:00:28.760
<v Speaker 1>that's something in and of itself,</v>

12
00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:29.030
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

13
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:29.301
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

14
00:00:29.301 --> 00:00:33.200
<v Speaker 1>the fact that you've all seen it means that it's an production of cultural</v>

15
00:00:33.201 --> 00:00:36.200
<v Speaker 1>significance and because it's such a strange artifact,</v>

16
00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.520
<v Speaker 1>that's one way of looking at it.</v>

17
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.990
<v Speaker 1>It might be worth trying to take it apart to understand why it is,</v>

18
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.741
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

19
00:00:42.741 --> 00:00:44.180
<v Speaker 1>that you even understand it.</v>

20
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.140
<v Speaker 1>And so I offered you the proposition last week that we view the world</v>

21
00:00:50.931 --> 00:00:52.880
<v Speaker 1>essentially through a narrative lens.</v>

22
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.690
<v Speaker 1>And I believe that we view the world through a narrative lens because of the</v>

23
00:00:56.691 --> 00:01:01.160
<v Speaker 1>fundamental problem that we have to solve as living creatures is how we should</v>

24
00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:02.180
<v Speaker 1>act in the world.</v>

25
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.880
<v Speaker 1>And that means how we should act to maintain ourselves,</v>

26
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.040
<v Speaker 1>but also how we need to act in relationship to other people and in relationship</v>

27
00:01:13.041 --> 00:01:14.120
<v Speaker 1>to the broader world.</v>

28
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.210
<v Speaker 1>In order to maintain ourselves across time.</v>

29
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.580
<v Speaker 1>So that's a complicated problem,</v>

30
00:01:19.581 --> 00:01:19.821
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

31
00:01:19.821 --> 00:01:21.560
<v Speaker 1>It's not just how you survive,</v>

32
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.860
<v Speaker 1>it's how you survive now and next week and next month and next year and 50 years</v>

33
00:01:27.381 --> 00:01:28.580
<v Speaker 1>from now and maybe your,</v>

34
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.330
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

35
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

36
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.100
<v Speaker 1>your descendants as well if the culture is going to stabilize and then not only</v>

37
00:01:34.101 --> 00:01:37.820
<v Speaker 1>you across all those timeframes but you and everyone else across all those</v>

38
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.640
<v Speaker 1>timeframes to viciously difficult problem.</v>

39
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.450
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say that we have evolved mechanisms to solve that.</v>

40
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:47.210
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

41
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.420
<v Speaker 1>I think that's self evident in some sense because for example,</v>

42
00:01:50.421 --> 00:01:55.340
<v Speaker 1>one of the mechanisms that animals have evolved to deal with the problem of</v>

43
00:01:55.341 --> 00:01:56.570
<v Speaker 1>social being,</v>

44
00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.150
<v Speaker 1>even if they're not particularly social animals,</v>

45
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.950
<v Speaker 1>is the dominance hierarchy.</v>

46
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.341
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

47
00:02:01.341 --> 00:02:04.010
<v Speaker 1>Or You could call it a hierarchy of authority or power.</v>

48
00:02:04.011 --> 00:02:08.090
<v Speaker 1>Because I think considering human structures,</v>

49
00:02:08.091 --> 00:02:13.091
<v Speaker 1>social structures as mirror power structures is a terrible mistake.</v>

50
00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:15.950
<v Speaker 1>It's a terrible oversimplification</v>

51
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.220
<v Speaker 1>because power is by no means the only like force is what I mean.</v>

52
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.230
<v Speaker 1>Force is not a stable way of solving the problem of how to live together across</v>

53
00:02:27.591 --> 00:02:28.424
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

54
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.380
<v Speaker 1>The question is what is the stable way of solving how to live together across</v>

55
00:02:33.381 --> 00:02:33.711
<v Speaker 1>time?</v>

56
00:02:33.711 --> 00:02:37.640
<v Speaker 1>And that really is the question and it's part of the question that I'm trying to</v>

57
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.140
<v Speaker 1>answer partly because it's a perennial problem,</v>

58
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.500
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

59
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.830
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

60
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.830
<v Speaker 1>we faced the problem of how to organize ourselves in small social units without</v>

61
00:02:48.051 --> 00:02:49.010
<v Speaker 1>undue conflict.</v>

62
00:02:49.011 --> 00:02:53.000
<v Speaker 1>And then we faced the larger problem of how to organize ourselves into large</v>

63
00:02:53.001 --> 00:02:55.610
<v Speaker 1>social units without undue conflict.</v>

64
00:02:55.611 --> 00:02:59.450
<v Speaker 1>And that conflict can be absolutely devastating and,</v>

65
00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.810
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

66
00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.170
<v Speaker 1>and frequently is so.</v>

67
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.510
<v Speaker 1>So then I would also say that the first way of solving this problem isn't</v>

68
00:03:07.511 --> 00:03:08.350
<v Speaker 1>conscious.</v>

69
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.700
<v Speaker 1>You say not at all.</v>

70
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.290
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

71
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.530
<v Speaker 1>you may know and you may not know that there are,</v>

72
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.350
<v Speaker 1>there are different forms of memory,</v>

73
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:18.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

74
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.320
<v Speaker 1>Really technically different forms of memory.</v>

75
00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:21.250
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

76
00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.980
<v Speaker 1>there's short term working memory,</v>

77
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.840
<v Speaker 1>which is the memory that you use to hold things like telephone numbers in your</v>

78
00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:29.890
<v Speaker 1>act of imagination.</v>

79
00:03:29.891 --> 00:03:31.300
<v Speaker 1>It decays very rapidly.</v>

80
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.550
<v Speaker 1>It's only about four to seven bits,</v>

81
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.593
<v Speaker 1>which is why,</v>

82
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:35.201
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

83
00:03:35.201 --> 00:03:40.000
<v Speaker 1>it's white phone numbers or were at least seven digits long.</v>

84
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

85
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.080
<v Speaker 1>you can kind of manage that as a loop.</v>

86
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.040
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

87
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.990
<v Speaker 1>and then there's um,</v>

88
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.550
<v Speaker 1>episodic memory and that has two elements.</v>

89
00:03:51.551 --> 00:03:55.690
<v Speaker 1>One is semantic and the other is a episodic.</v>

90
00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:56.730
<v Speaker 1>It's a help.</v>

91
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.940
<v Speaker 1>What's the name of that?</v>

92
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.590
<v Speaker 1>Someone said something?</v>

93
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.751
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

94
00:04:04.751 --> 00:04:06.610
<v Speaker 1>Well there's procedural memory and then there's,</v>

95
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:07.840
<v Speaker 1>there's another,</v>

96
00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.910
<v Speaker 1>the kind of memory that you use to represent your experiences to yourself.</v>

97
00:04:12.911 --> 00:04:17.911
<v Speaker 1>So let's say it's image Laden and the other one is semantic and semantic is your</v>

98
00:04:17.951 --> 00:04:19.030
<v Speaker 1>memory for facts.</v>

99
00:04:19.031 --> 00:04:20.470
<v Speaker 1>And those are quite different.</v>

100
00:04:20.471 --> 00:04:21.430
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

101
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.230
<v Speaker 1>procedural memory,</v>

102
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.390
<v Speaker 1>that's how you ride a bike.</v>

103
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:26.710
<v Speaker 1>That's how you play the piano.</v>

104
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.330
<v Speaker 1>That's how you play jazz music.</v>

105
00:04:28.331 --> 00:04:29.440
<v Speaker 1>If you're in a combo,</v>

106
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:30.483
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

107
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.630
<v Speaker 1>it's the memory.</v>

108
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:32.360
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

109
00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.640
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

110
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.560
<v Speaker 1>it's a funny kind of memory cause it's actually built right into you.</v>

111
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.891
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

112
00:04:35.891 --> 00:04:40.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean so as so as the kind of memory that used to represent your life,</v>

113
00:04:40.751 --> 00:04:42.760
<v Speaker 1>but it's much more malleable in some sense.</v>

114
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.440
<v Speaker 1>So what that means is that in your procedures,</v>

115
00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:53.080
<v Speaker 1>there is information that you don't know about pattern information that you</v>

116
00:04:53.081 --> 00:04:53.914
<v Speaker 1>don't know about.</v>

117
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.390
<v Speaker 1>Part of that is how to act.</v>

118
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.961
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

119
00:04:55.961 --> 00:04:58.540
<v Speaker 1>like when you walk into a social gathering,</v>

120
00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.210
<v Speaker 1>you don't really think through how you're going to act.</v>

121
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.410
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

122
00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.920
<v Speaker 1>you know how to act and if someone asked you exactly what it is that you're</v>

123
00:05:05.921 --> 00:05:09.100
<v Speaker 1>doing and why you could formulate a story about it,</v>

124
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.140
<v Speaker 1>but the probability that that it's the existence of that story that enabled you</v>

125
00:05:14.141 --> 00:05:18.250
<v Speaker 1>to act that way as zero because you have to react way faster than that.</v>

126
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.761
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

127
00:05:18.761 --> 00:05:18.971
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

128
00:05:18.971 --> 00:05:23.470
<v Speaker 1>you have social knowledge built into your nervous system because you've</v>

129
00:05:23.471 --> 00:05:26.680
<v Speaker 1>practiced being a social being for a very long period of time.</v>

130
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:32.250
<v Speaker 1>And of course then that social being has been shaped for forever really.</v>

131
00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.120
<v Speaker 1>And it's the right way of thinking about it.</v>

132
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:34.750
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

133
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.750
<v Speaker 1>we know that animals organize themselves into hierarchies and we'll say of</v>

134
00:05:39.971 --> 00:05:41.170
<v Speaker 1>dominance because it's more,</v>

135
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.240
<v Speaker 1>more true the farther back you go in time,</v>

136
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.910
<v Speaker 1>at least since the time of the crustaceans.</v>

137
00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:46.271
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

138
00:05:46.271 --> 00:05:50.350
<v Speaker 1>when we split from our common ancestor 300 million years ago.</v>

139
00:05:50.351 --> 00:05:50.950
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

140
00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.680
<v Speaker 1>and it's true for social animals and non social animals.</v>

141
00:05:53.681 --> 00:05:58.681
<v Speaker 1>So even animals that don't live together in groups have to organize themselves</v>

142
00:05:58.851 --> 00:06:01.620
<v Speaker 1>into a hierarchy in the space they inhabit.</v>

143
00:06:01.621 --> 00:06:03.170
<v Speaker 1>Songbirds are a good example.</v>

144
00:06:03.171 --> 00:06:05.240
<v Speaker 1>And they have dominance disputes all the time.</v>

145
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:06.350
<v Speaker 1>Partly that's,</v>

146
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.800
<v Speaker 1>you can hear them having their little dominance disputes in the spring when</v>

147
00:06:09.801 --> 00:06:13.280
<v Speaker 1>they're singing because basically what they're singing is I'm pretty damn</v>

148
00:06:13.281 --> 00:06:14.810
<v Speaker 1>healthy and I'm ready to go.</v>

149
00:06:14.811 --> 00:06:16.310
<v Speaker 1>And if you're another bird like me,</v>

150
00:06:16.311 --> 00:06:17.960
<v Speaker 1>you better steer clear this tree.</v>

151
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:18.990
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

152
00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.823
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

153
00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:21.580
<v Speaker 1>the dominant song birds,</v>

154
00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:22.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

155
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.710
<v Speaker 1>they don't live together crozer social,</v>

156
00:06:24.711 --> 00:06:25.880
<v Speaker 1>but most songbirds aren't.</v>

157
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:31.280
<v Speaker 1>The dominant songbirds get the best nest and the best nest is the one that</v>

158
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:33.700
<v Speaker 1>doesn't get rained on isn't,</v>

159
00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.730
<v Speaker 1>it's not too windy and it's close to food sources and you know,</v>

160
00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:41.450
<v Speaker 1>and so then they have the healthiest chicks and they attract the best mates.</v>

161
00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.540
<v Speaker 1>And like it's really important where you're positioned in the hierarchy,</v>

162
00:06:44.541 --> 00:06:47.930
<v Speaker 1>even if you're not like a flock or herd creature.</v>

163
00:06:47.931 --> 00:06:49.610
<v Speaker 1>Now we're more like herd creatures.</v>

164
00:06:49.611 --> 00:06:50.600
<v Speaker 1>So it's even more,</v>

165
00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:51.580
<v Speaker 1>it's even,</v>

166
00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.030
<v Speaker 1>it's even more relevant to us,</v>

167
00:06:53.031 --> 00:06:58.031
<v Speaker 1>but there's just no escaping a hierarchical arrangement in social being that is</v>

168
00:06:59.661 --> 00:07:00.530
<v Speaker 1>social being.</v>

169
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:01.580
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

170
00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:02.180
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

171
00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:06.170
<v Speaker 1>and it's evolutionarily ancient beyond conception.</v>

172
00:07:06.171 --> 00:07:09.170
<v Speaker 1>So 300 million years ago there weren't trees,</v>

173
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:09.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

174
00:07:09.651 --> 00:07:09.921
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

175
00:07:09.921 --> 00:07:13.010
<v Speaker 1>so the dominance hierarchy is older than trees.</v>

176
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:15.140
<v Speaker 1>So that's really something to think about.</v>

177
00:07:15.141 --> 00:07:15.771
<v Speaker 1>And then you know,</v>

178
00:07:15.771 --> 00:07:20.570
<v Speaker 1>when you're thinking about the reality that shaped us say from an evolutionary</v>

179
00:07:20.571 --> 00:07:21.231
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

180
00:07:21.231 --> 00:07:23.000
<v Speaker 1>but also from a cultural perspective,</v>

181
00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:28.160
<v Speaker 1>what you have to understand is that the things that have shaped us most are the</v>

182
00:07:28.161 --> 00:07:30.320
<v Speaker 1>things that have been around the longest.</v>

183
00:07:30.321 --> 00:07:35.180
<v Speaker 1>And so you could say those are the most real things and you can't even see some</v>

184
00:07:35.181 --> 00:07:35.450
<v Speaker 1>of them.</v>

185
00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.130
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not like you can come in here.</v>

186
00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:38.690
<v Speaker 1>Well it's not exactly true.</v>

187
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:42.290
<v Speaker 1>You can't come in here and see the multiple dominance hierarchies that are at</v>

188
00:07:42.291 --> 00:07:42.770
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

189
00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:43.700
<v Speaker 1>You can in a way,</v>

190
00:07:43.701 --> 00:07:48.620
<v Speaker 1>because the chairs are set up to face this way and I'm facing that way.</v>

191
00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:52.730
<v Speaker 1>That gives you some clues about the social order here and you take the cues</v>

192
00:07:52.731 --> 00:07:53.331
<v Speaker 1>instantly,</v>

193
00:07:53.331 --> 00:07:53.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

194
00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:54.613
<v Speaker 1>You come down,</v>

195
00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.000
<v Speaker 1>you sit in the chairs,</v>

196
00:07:56.150 --> 00:08:00.290
<v Speaker 1>you organize yourselves according to mutual expectation and that's part of your</v>

197
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:04.130
<v Speaker 1>procedural knowledge about how to behave as a social creature.</v>

198
00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.890
<v Speaker 1>Now that knowledge is really,</v>

199
00:08:06.891 --> 00:08:07.551
<v Speaker 1>really deep.</v>

200
00:08:07.551 --> 00:08:12.050
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of it's coded in your behavior now and another people's behavior as</v>

201
00:08:12.051 --> 00:08:12.740
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

202
00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:13.101
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

203
00:08:13.101 --> 00:08:13.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

204
00:08:13.401 --> 00:08:13.910
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

205
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.340
<v Speaker 1>that's the expectations you have of other people,</v>

206
00:08:16.341 --> 00:08:17.270
<v Speaker 1>end of yourself.</v>

207
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:18.590
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of those are implicit,</v>

208
00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:19.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

209
00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:21.020
<v Speaker 1>So when we're interacting,</v>

210
00:08:21.021 --> 00:08:21.321
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

211
00:08:21.321 --> 00:08:21.820
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

212
00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:25.490
<v Speaker 1>there's a very large number of things that you just don't get to do.</v>

213
00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:27.110
<v Speaker 1>And you know that too,</v>

214
00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:28.340
<v Speaker 1>and you won't do them.</v>

215
00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:31.880
<v Speaker 1>And that way we can act as if we understand each other,</v>

216
00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:33.260
<v Speaker 1>even though we don't,</v>

217
00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:35.090
<v Speaker 1>because you're really complicated.</v>

218
00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:38.990
<v Speaker 1>And I'm really complicated and there's lots of situations where we might really</v>

219
00:08:38.991 --> 00:08:39.920
<v Speaker 1>be in conflict,</v>

220
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:43.850
<v Speaker 1>but because we share a map of the culture,</v>

221
00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.320
<v Speaker 1>the cultural expectations,</v>

222
00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:46.460
<v Speaker 1>it makes part of our,</v>

223
00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:48.470
<v Speaker 1>it's built right into our perception.</v>

224
00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:51.560
<v Speaker 1>You will act out that set of expectations.</v>

225
00:08:51.561 --> 00:08:52.640
<v Speaker 1>And so will I,</v>

226
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:55.430
<v Speaker 1>and if neither of us can do that,</v>

227
00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:56.750
<v Speaker 1>even if one of us can't,</v>

228
00:08:56.751 --> 00:08:57.560
<v Speaker 1>we're going to stay.</v>

229
00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:01.520
<v Speaker 1>We're either going to immediately devolve into conflict or we're going to avoid</v>

230
00:09:01.521 --> 00:09:02.720
<v Speaker 1>each other like the plague.</v>

231
00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:04.850
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly the right thing to do.</v>
