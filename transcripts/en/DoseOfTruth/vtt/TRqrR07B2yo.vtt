1
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.493
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.310
<v Speaker 1>we actually have it in Sweden.</v>

3
00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:12.380
<v Speaker 1>It's called the,</v>

4
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.250
<v Speaker 1>I think the translation is</v>

5
00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.300
<v Speaker 1>and gender mainstreaming in,</v>

6
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.190
<v Speaker 1>in English,</v>

7
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.220
<v Speaker 1>but it's basically you have to include gender scientific perspectives into all</v>

8
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.820
<v Speaker 1>this is happening within all Swedish universities right now.</v>

9
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.450
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

10
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.350
<v Speaker 1>so you have to include the perspective of gender,</v>

11
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.213
<v Speaker 1>gender,</v>

12
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.580
<v Speaker 1>gender,</v>

13
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:38.750
<v Speaker 1>scientific perspective,</v>

14
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.140
<v Speaker 1>all parts of the university.</v>

15
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.590
<v Speaker 1>So it's not just literature lists of courses,</v>

16
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.240
<v Speaker 1>it's also the who are you going to recruit?</v>

17
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.830
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

18
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:47.663
<v Speaker 1>the number,</v>

19
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.290
<v Speaker 1>and we have a goal in Sweden and,</v>

20
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.670
<v Speaker 1>from the government.</v>

22
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.580
<v Speaker 1>This is all the government's doing.</v>

23
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.993
<v Speaker 1>MMM.</v>

24
00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.840
<v Speaker 1>We have a goal that I think it's 40% of all the professors,</v>

25
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

26
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.750
<v Speaker 1>by 2020 should be women.</v>

27
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:04.151
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

28
00:01:04.151 --> 00:01:07.480
<v Speaker 1>Which means that if you're a young man who's entering academia,</v>

29
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.540
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you're going to get to job zero.</v>

30
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

31
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:12.120
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

32
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.400
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

33
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.581
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

34
00:01:12.581 --> 00:01:13.780
<v Speaker 1>the same thing's happening here.</v>

35
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:14.680
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

36
00:01:14.681 --> 00:01:14.980
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

37
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:15.191
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

38
00:01:15.191 --> 00:01:16.330
<v Speaker 1>our minister of science,</v>

39
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.150
<v Speaker 1>who was one of the people,</v>

40
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.731
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

41
00:01:20.731 --> 00:01:24.960
<v Speaker 1>selected because of Trudeau's insistence upon gender equity in his cabinet.</v>

42
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.353
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

43
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.503
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.430
<v Speaker 1>he could have picked a number of women that was proportionate to the number of</v>

45
00:01:32.431 --> 00:01:33.420
<v Speaker 1>women elected.</v>

46
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.990
<v Speaker 1>Like even that I wouldn't have agreed with because I think he should've gone on</v>

47
00:01:36.991 --> 00:01:38.080
<v Speaker 1>straight competence and,</v>

48
00:01:38.081 --> 00:01:38.370
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

49
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.760
<v Speaker 1>and taken on the heavy moral burden of trying to figure out what competence</v>

50
00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:44.230
<v Speaker 1>meant but just,</v>

51
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:45.171
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

52
00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:46.040
<v Speaker 1>it had to be 50,</v>

53
00:01:46.041 --> 00:01:46.461
<v Speaker 1>50,</v>

54
00:01:46.461 --> 00:01:47.690
<v Speaker 1>because I guess that was,</v>

55
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

56
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.550
<v Speaker 1>this is a very snide thing to say,</v>

57
00:01:49.551 --> 00:01:52.760
<v Speaker 1>but that seems to be at the level of arithmetic intelligence that he could</v>

58
00:01:52.761 --> 00:01:53.594
<v Speaker 1>manifest.</v>

59
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.531
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

60
00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:55.100
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

61
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.700
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

62
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.560
<v Speaker 1>and one of his ministers,</v>

63
00:01:57.561 --> 00:01:58.940
<v Speaker 1>our Minister of science has,</v>

64
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.550
<v Speaker 1>we have this program called camp.</v>

65
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.370
<v Speaker 1>The Canada research chairs and the Canada research chairs were set up so that</v>

66
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.630
<v Speaker 1>Canadian universities would have an additional amount of money to hire the most</v>

67
00:02:08.631 --> 00:02:13.490
<v Speaker 1>qualified people they possibly could for senior named chair positions.</v>

68
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.760
<v Speaker 1>And the idea was to attract international talent,</v>

69
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.253
<v Speaker 1>like high level.</v>

70
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.610
<v Speaker 1>Now what has happened,</v>

71
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.170
<v Speaker 1>because it wasn't very well designed,</v>

72
00:02:21.171 --> 00:02:25.070
<v Speaker 1>this program was that Canadian universities mostly ended up poaching from each</v>

73
00:02:25.071 --> 00:02:25.904
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

74
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:26.783
<v Speaker 1>which was,</v>

75
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:27.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

76
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.780
<v Speaker 1>relatively counterproductive because it just elevated the salaries of the</v>

77
00:02:30.781 --> 00:02:31.321
<v Speaker 1>professors,</v>

78
00:02:31.321 --> 00:02:35.070
<v Speaker 1>which maybe they deserve rather than bringing in a lot of international talent.</v>

79
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.480
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>

80
00:02:36.481 --> 00:02:40.650
<v Speaker 1>we're radically overrepresented in Canada research chairs now.</v>

81
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.860
<v Speaker 1>The Minister of science is very annoyed about this and thinks that that's a</v>

82
00:02:43.861 --> 00:02:45.210
<v Speaker 1>consequence of systemic.</v>

83
00:02:45.211 --> 00:02:45.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

84
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.960
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

85
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.480
<v Speaker 1>misogyny or some some bloody thing.</v>

86
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.280
<v Speaker 1>Failing to note entirely.</v>

87
00:02:50.281 --> 00:02:50.640
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

88
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.710
<v Speaker 1>if you look at scientific productivity,</v>

89
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.820
<v Speaker 1>it's very interesting because and gender,</v>

90
00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.700
<v Speaker 1>the median professor male and</v>

91
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.350
<v Speaker 1>publish approximately the same amount.</v>

92
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:03.700
<v Speaker 1>So the typical,</v>

93
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.013
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

94
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.410
<v Speaker 1>the exceptional professors are almost all men.</v>

95
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.820
<v Speaker 1>Even though the typical male and female can't really be distinguished in</v>

96
00:03:12.821 --> 00:03:13.390
<v Speaker 1>academia.</v>

97
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.900
<v Speaker 1>If you'd take that tiny subset of hyper productive professors,</v>

98
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:17.950
<v Speaker 1>they're almost all male.</v>

99
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.420
<v Speaker 1>Now why that is is my suspicions are that it's pretty straight forward.</v>

100
00:03:22.421 --> 00:03:27.070
<v Speaker 1>I suspect that the reason it is is because to be a hyper productive in any given</v>

101
00:03:27.071 --> 00:03:31.900
<v Speaker 1>field means you have to be absolutely single minded and obsessed about it as</v>

102
00:03:31.901 --> 00:03:33.430
<v Speaker 1>well as being very intelligent,</v>

103
00:03:33.431 --> 00:03:34.360
<v Speaker 1>conscientious.</v>

104
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.171
<v Speaker 1>So it's rare,</v>

105
00:03:35.171 --> 00:03:35.620
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

106
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.540
<v Speaker 1>You have to be intelligent,</v>

107
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.410
<v Speaker 1>say 99th percentile conscientious,</v>

108
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.060
<v Speaker 1>95th percentile.</v>

109
00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:43.661
<v Speaker 1>So that's hard.</v>

110
00:03:43.661 --> 00:03:44.830
<v Speaker 1>The anybody right there.</v>

111
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.040
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to have the time available to do nothing whatsoever,</v>

112
00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:51.790
<v Speaker 1>but concentrate on your work.</v>

113
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:53.141
<v Speaker 1>No family,</v>

114
00:03:53.141 --> 00:03:53.951
<v Speaker 1>no friends,</v>

115
00:03:53.951 --> 00:03:54.880
<v Speaker 1>nothing like that.</v>

116
00:03:54.881 --> 00:03:59.230
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to be at the very top of your profession because obviously</v>

117
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.120
<v Speaker 1>you'll get out competed otherwise.</v>

118
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.700
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a lot harder for women because,</v>

119
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.923
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

120
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.280
<v Speaker 1>for obvious reasons,</v>

121
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean so,</v>

122
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.110
<v Speaker 1>so the mere fact that most of these people were,</v>

123
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.030
<v Speaker 1>see the other thing people don't understand is that people can on average be</v>

124
00:04:16.031 --> 00:04:16.960
<v Speaker 1>very similar.</v>

125
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:19.090
<v Speaker 1>So their distributions,</v>

126
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.030
<v Speaker 1>but if you go way out on to the edges of the distribution,</v>

127
00:04:22.031 --> 00:04:26.260
<v Speaker 1>small differences in the middle can make massive differences at the edge.</v>

128
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.461
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

129
00:04:27.461 --> 00:04:30.790
<v Speaker 1>and that's the kind of phenomena you see where you are selecting the highest</v>

130
00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:31.720
<v Speaker 1>qualified people.</v>

131
00:04:31.721 --> 00:04:32.030
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

132
00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.390
<v Speaker 1>it's an edge of the distribution phenomena.</v>

133
00:04:34.391 --> 00:04:35.350
<v Speaker 1>So here's an example.</v>

134
00:04:35.351 --> 00:04:36.340
<v Speaker 1>This is really cool one.</v>

135
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.510
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at the overlap between male and female aggression,</v>

136
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:41.741
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty high.</v>

137
00:04:41.741 --> 00:04:46.030
<v Speaker 1>So if you randomly select a man and a woman from the general population,</v>

138
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.420
<v Speaker 1>and you bet that the woman was the more aggressive of the two,</v>

139
00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.670
<v Speaker 1>you'd be right 40% of the time,</v>

140
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.710
<v Speaker 1>which is actually pretty often.</v>

141
00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.113
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

142
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.940
<v Speaker 1>but if you go way the hell out to where,</v>

143
00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.980
<v Speaker 1>let's say you only imprisoned the one in 100 most aggressive people,</v>

144
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:04.713
<v Speaker 1>they're all men.</v>

145
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.530
<v Speaker 1>Even though on average it's 60 40 you'd go out to the 99th percentile.</v>

146
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:13.091
<v Speaker 1>It's all men,</v>

147
00:05:13.091 --> 00:05:16.390
<v Speaker 1>which is why almost all the people in prison are men now.</v>

148
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.670
<v Speaker 1>So people,</v>

149
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:19.371
<v Speaker 1>well it's,</v>

150
00:05:19.371 --> 00:05:20.204
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

151
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:21.130
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

152
00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.570
<v Speaker 1>What you're describing in Sweden,</v>

153
00:05:22.571 --> 00:05:24.070
<v Speaker 1>that's the death of the universities.</v>

154
00:05:24.071 --> 00:05:24.730
<v Speaker 1>It's another,</v>

155
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.110
<v Speaker 1>it's another sign of like,</v>

156
00:05:26.111 --> 00:05:27.670
<v Speaker 1>the universities are killing themselves.</v>

157
00:05:27.671 --> 00:05:30.850
<v Speaker 1>They're hiring adjunct professors and not faculty members.</v>

158
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.630
<v Speaker 1>Like I think it's up to 70% in some American universities.</v>

159
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:35.800
<v Speaker 1>They have no salary,</v>

160
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:36.610
<v Speaker 1>no power,</v>

161
00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:37.480
<v Speaker 1>no autonomy,</v>

162
00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.070
<v Speaker 1>no job security,</v>

163
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:39.680
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

164
00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.011
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

165
00:05:40.011 --> 00:05:40.271
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

166
00:05:40.271 --> 00:05:41.104
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

167
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

168
00:05:41.501 --> 00:05:45.340
<v Speaker 1>some of these adjuncts teach four or five courses a year and make $25,000.</v>

169
00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:46.510
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

170
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.970
<v Speaker 1>I read about one who lived in her car.</v>

171
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:51.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

172
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.611
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

173
00:05:51.611 --> 00:05:53.800
<v Speaker 1>So they've jacked up tuition,</v>

174
00:05:53.801 --> 00:05:55.750
<v Speaker 1>but you honorary proletariat.</v>

175
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.411
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

176
00:05:56.411 --> 00:05:56.960
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

177
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:57.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

178
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.921
<v Speaker 1>there you go.</v>

179
00:05:57.921 --> 00:05:58.754
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

180
00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:59.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

181
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.553
<v Speaker 1>they've jacked up too.</v>

182
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.980
<v Speaker 1>They've jacked up tuition to the point where it's unsustainable.</v>

183
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.660
<v Speaker 1>They've made it impossible for kids who rack up tuition debt to declare</v>

184
00:06:11.661 --> 00:06:14.780
<v Speaker 1>bankruptcy because they've taken that out of the bankruptcy laws.</v>

185
00:06:14.781 --> 00:06:17.780
<v Speaker 1>Now you can take away their driver's license if they don't pay their,</v>

186
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.591
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

187
00:06:18.591 --> 00:06:19.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

188
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.173
<v Speaker 1>their tuition,</v>

189
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.620
<v Speaker 1>their student loan bills.</v>

190
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.690
<v Speaker 1>So it's basically indentured servitude,</v>

191
00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:24.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

192
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.200
<v Speaker 1>The administration has become completely top heavy.</v>

193
00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:32.530
<v Speaker 1>The academy is completely infested by these terrible equity ideas that you're</v>

194
00:06:33.621 --> 00:06:34.310
<v Speaker 1>laying out.</v>

195
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.143
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

196
00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:36.093
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

197
00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:36.440
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

198
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.380
<v Speaker 1>and the people who are in the radical leftists disciplines,</v>

199
00:06:39.381 --> 00:06:43.670
<v Speaker 1>which increasingly are spreading their influence out through the entire</v>

200
00:06:43.671 --> 00:06:47.750
<v Speaker 1>universities are tenured and won't be moved for 25 years.</v>

201
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.190
<v Speaker 1>So as far as I can tell,</v>

202
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:51.230
<v Speaker 1>it's done.</v>
