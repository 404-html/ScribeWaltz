1
00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:07.660
<v Speaker 1>In the United States,</v>

2
00:00:07.661 --> 00:00:10.090
<v Speaker 1>we have about 330 million people.</v>

3
00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.510
<v Speaker 1>And because of the distribution,</v>

4
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.840
<v Speaker 1>relatively normal distribution of Iq scores,</v>

5
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.140
<v Speaker 1>about 16% have iqs of 85 or two means they're not going to graduate school.</v>

6
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.241
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

7
00:00:26.241 --> 00:00:27.170
<v Speaker 2>it means that from,</v>

8
00:00:27.171 --> 00:00:28.610
<v Speaker 2>from what I've read practically,</v>

9
00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:31.370
<v Speaker 2>it means the wonderlic company has actually done a really,</v>

10
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.830
<v Speaker 2>they have a nice I cute tennis from the commercial perspective,</v>

11
00:00:33.831 --> 00:00:34.011
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

12
00:00:34.011 --> 00:00:38.900
<v Speaker 2>it's actually psychometrically valid and they've linked Iq levels to,</v>

13
00:00:38.901 --> 00:00:39.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

14
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.900
<v Speaker 2>to job specifically the job categories,</v>

15
00:00:41.901 --> 00:00:42.734
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

16
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.610
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

17
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.510
<v Speaker 1>not a lot.</v>

18
00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:47.540
<v Speaker 1>I was going to say is they're not only not going to graduate school,</v>

19
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.900
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to find a stable job that pays a livable wage.</v>

20
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

21
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.351
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

22
00:00:56.351 --> 00:01:00.180
<v Speaker 2>especially even given that so many of the service jobs now require a fair high</v>

23
00:01:00.181 --> 00:01:03.220
<v Speaker 2>degree of computational savvy or leader built,</v>

24
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.780
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

25
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:04.620
<v Speaker 2>not computation,</v>

26
00:01:04.621 --> 00:01:09.390
<v Speaker 2>but ability to interact with complex computational technology loves the typical</v>

27
00:01:09.391 --> 00:01:14.391
<v Speaker 2>till Latta and a checkout market or the till at a Mcdonald's because Mcdonald's</v>

28
00:01:14.761 --> 00:01:16.080
<v Speaker 2>is actually very complicated,</v>

29
00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.010
<v Speaker 2>is often far beyond the ability of people who are on the low end of the</v>

30
00:01:20.011 --> 00:01:21.300
<v Speaker 2>intelligence distribution.</v>

31
00:01:21.301 --> 00:01:22.410
<v Speaker 2>And they claimed,</v>

32
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.940
<v Speaker 2>I think it was wonderlic,</v>

33
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.751
<v Speaker 2>although it might know,</v>

34
00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:25.470
<v Speaker 2>it might've been,</v>

35
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.180
<v Speaker 2>it might've been hunt.</v>

36
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.373
<v Speaker 2>What's his name?</v>

37
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.280
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

38
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.300
<v Speaker 2>Iq researcher.</v>

39
00:01:30.301 --> 00:01:31.140
<v Speaker 2>He said Earl haunt,</v>

40
00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:36.141
<v Speaker 2>I think possibly what he claimed that that if you have an Iq of below 90,</v>

41
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.790
<v Speaker 2>that it's,</v>

42
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:39.780
<v Speaker 2>it's difficult.</v>

43
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.250
<v Speaker 2>It's difficult for you to read well enough to translate what you're reading into</v>

44
00:01:44.251 --> 00:01:44.940
<v Speaker 2>action.</v>

45
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.580
<v Speaker 2>So you can't actually read instructions and follow them.</v>

46
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.320
<v Speaker 2>You don't have that level of literacy.</v>

47
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.363
<v Speaker 1>That's correct.</v>

48
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:51.413
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

49
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.740
<v Speaker 1>I was going to say that in,</v>

50
00:01:52.741 --> 00:01:54.030
<v Speaker 1>in the United States,</v>

51
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.900
<v Speaker 1>this bottom 16% translates into 51 million people.</v>

52
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.830
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

53
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.460
<v Speaker 1>Including 13 million children who are in school.</v>

54
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.450
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

55
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.520
<v Speaker 1>This is a very difficult problem.</v>

56
00:02:08.521 --> 00:02:08.731
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

57
00:02:08.731 --> 00:02:09.540
<v Speaker 1>I knew where Ohio,</v>

58
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.150
<v Speaker 1>he passed away when I knew him pretty well.</v>

59
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.300
<v Speaker 1>He also would say that there is this a cognitive segregation in society.</v>

60
00:02:21.031 --> 00:02:22.920
<v Speaker 1>This is a point that Charles Murray makes.</v>

61
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:23.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

62
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:24.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

63
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.640
<v Speaker 1>and Earl would often ask,</v>

64
00:02:25.641 --> 00:02:26.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

65
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

66
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.080
<v Speaker 1>when's the last time you had someone over for dinner who wasn't a college</v>

67
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.943
<v Speaker 1>graduate?</v>

68
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.491
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

69
00:02:32.491 --> 00:02:35.550
<v Speaker 2>that was something that Marie and her Bernstein wrote about in their book the</v>

70
00:02:35.551 --> 00:02:36.181
<v Speaker 2>bell curve,</v>

71
00:02:36.181 --> 00:02:38.310
<v Speaker 2>which really struck me because I read that book twice,</v>

72
00:02:38.311 --> 00:02:40.260
<v Speaker 2>unlike most of the people criticized it.</v>

73
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:41.880
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

74
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.670
<v Speaker 2>we're one of the things that they pointed out in there,</v>

75
00:02:44.671 --> 00:02:44.851
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

76
00:02:44.851 --> 00:02:45.530
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

77
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.920
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

78
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.753
<v Speaker 2>the typical,</v>

79
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.110
<v Speaker 2>the typical educated person thinks that someone isn't very bright if they have</v>

80
00:02:52.111 --> 00:02:55.250
<v Speaker 2>an Iq of 150 grand.</v>

81
00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.760
<v Speaker 2>How'd you at graduate level,</v>

82
00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.420
<v Speaker 2>Phd level research institutions cause 115 there's,</v>

83
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.560
<v Speaker 2>there's as many people at 115 above as there are at 85 and below.</v>

84
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.780
<v Speaker 2>And so it's a minority of the population and that's the top 15% and you know,</v>

85
00:03:10.781 --> 00:03:11.230
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

86
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.300
<v Speaker 2>that's the dollar undergraduate,</v>

87
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:14.171
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

88
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:15.004
<v Speaker 2>So why don't you just,</v>

89
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.731
<v Speaker 2>people have to see,</v>

90
00:03:15.731 --> 00:03:18.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm a clinical psychologist and I've dealt with people who,</v>

91
00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.450
<v Speaker 2>how do I ranges in the low eighties and tried to find them jobs and tried to</v>

92
00:03:22.451 --> 00:03:22.871
<v Speaker 2>train them.</v>

93
00:03:22.871 --> 00:03:27.871
<v Speaker 2>And I have some real knowledge about the stunning gap between people at the low</v>

94
00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:30.010
<v Speaker 2>end of the EICU distribution and the high end.</v>

95
00:03:30.011 --> 00:03:30.620
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

96
00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.600
<v Speaker 2>it's no bloody wonder.</v>

97
00:03:31.601 --> 00:03:35.950
<v Speaker 2>People hate Iq research and intelligence research because it reveals a set of</v>

98
00:03:35.951 --> 00:03:36.850
<v Speaker 2>seriously,</v>

99
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

100
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.900
<v Speaker 2>dismal facts about the incredible range of ability among human beings.</v>

101
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.500
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

102
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.333
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

103
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.170
<v Speaker 1>this is true.</v>

104
00:03:47.171 --> 00:03:48.280
<v Speaker 1>And Moreover,</v>

105
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.210
<v Speaker 1>I would add to this that people in universities,</v>

106
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.540
<v Speaker 1>professors and couple of graduate students,</v>

107
00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:56.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

108
00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.440
<v Speaker 1>have a hard time understanding what the,</v>

109
00:03:59.441 --> 00:04:01.450
<v Speaker 1>what everyday life is.</v>

110
00:04:01.451 --> 00:04:02.284
<v Speaker 1>Like.</v>

111
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.290
<v Speaker 1>If you have an Iq of 85 and we're making your way,</v>

112
00:04:07.451 --> 00:04:08.800
<v Speaker 1>you're living independently,</v>

113
00:04:08.801 --> 00:04:10.600
<v Speaker 1>you were making your way in the world,</v>

114
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.110
<v Speaker 1>but it is a challenge.</v>

115
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.240
<v Speaker 1>It is a really,</v>

116
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

117
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:17.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

118
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.910
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

119
00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.140
<v Speaker 2>just barely begins to describe it.</v>

120
00:04:20.141 --> 00:04:20.750
<v Speaker 2>I had a,</v>

121
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.750
<v Speaker 2>I had a client who he probably had an Iq of under 80 and nonverbal portion of it</v>

122
00:04:26.351 --> 00:04:26.771
<v Speaker 2>anyways.</v>

123
00:04:26.771 --> 00:04:27.500
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

124
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.970
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

125
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.490
<v Speaker 2>he was indistinguishable in physical appearance from,</v>

126
00:04:30.491 --> 00:04:31.900
<v Speaker 2>from let's say,</v>

127
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.300
<v Speaker 2>I hate to use the frame normal person,</v>

128
00:04:34.301 --> 00:04:36.940
<v Speaker 2>but there's nothing mark that mark Timm out about,</v>

129
00:04:36.941 --> 00:04:38.680
<v Speaker 2>particularly intellectually impaired,</v>

130
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:39.543
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

131
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:40.001
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

132
00:04:40.001 --> 00:04:40.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

133
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:41.770
<v Speaker 2>I tried at one point,</v>

134
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.940
<v Speaker 2>this is this,</v>

135
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:43.720
<v Speaker 2>this was so,</v>

136
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.160
<v Speaker 2>so telling to me.</v>

137
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.760
<v Speaker 2>I got him an inch,</v>

138
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:48.880
<v Speaker 2>a volunteer job,</v>

139
00:04:48.881 --> 00:04:49.421
<v Speaker 2>which by the way,</v>

140
00:04:49.421 --> 00:04:50.231
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult.</v>

141
00:04:50.231 --> 00:04:53.440
<v Speaker 2>It's harder to get a volunteer job in a real job because you have to do police</v>

142
00:04:53.441 --> 00:04:54.730
<v Speaker 2>screening and all sorts of things.</v>

143
00:04:54.731 --> 00:04:56.650
<v Speaker 2>And the selection process is just as extreme.</v>

144
00:04:56.651 --> 00:04:59.920
<v Speaker 2>But I eventually ended up getting him a job at a bike store,</v>

145
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.981
<v Speaker 2>bike,</v>

146
00:05:00.981 --> 00:05:01.361
<v Speaker 2>slash,</v>

147
00:05:01.361 --> 00:05:06.361
<v Speaker 2>bookstore and at that place couldn't hold him once the subsidy program had</v>

148
00:05:06.491 --> 00:05:06.970
<v Speaker 2>expired.</v>

149
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.970
<v Speaker 2>And then I got him a job at a charity and his job was to fold letters into three</v>

150
00:05:13.841 --> 00:05:15.670
<v Speaker 2>so that they can be put into envelopes.</v>

151
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:21.150
<v Speaker 2>Well that sounds easy except that he also had a bit of a motor tremor and you</v>

152
00:05:21.211 --> 00:05:21.970
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

153
00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.970
<v Speaker 2>it took me about 30 hours to train him to fold up a piece of paper with</v>

154
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.300
<v Speaker 2>sufficient precision so that it can be put in an envelope rapidly so that the</v>

155
00:05:31.301 --> 00:05:35.350
<v Speaker 2>envelope wasn't so mangled that it would get stuck in the automatic sorting</v>

156
00:05:35.351 --> 00:05:36.184
<v Speaker 2>machine.</v>

157
00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.590
<v Speaker 2>And another is high performance demands on him too.</v>

158
00:05:38.591 --> 00:05:43.390
<v Speaker 2>He had to whip through those letters pretty quickly and then sometimes the</v>

159
00:05:43.391 --> 00:05:48.160
<v Speaker 2>letters would have a photograph appended to them that was stapled on and they</v>

160
00:05:48.161 --> 00:05:50.200
<v Speaker 2>weren't always stapled on in the same place.</v>

161
00:05:50.201 --> 00:05:54.460
<v Speaker 2>So then he had to calculate how to fold the paper over the photograph without</v>

162
00:05:54.461 --> 00:05:59.030
<v Speaker 2>bending the photograph in precise third so that would still fit in the envelope.</v>

163
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:04.040
<v Speaker 2>And then he had to separate the French letters from the English letters and</v>

164
00:06:04.041 --> 00:06:08.120
<v Speaker 2>associate them with the proper envelopes and like that level of complexity just</v>

165
00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:08.960
<v Speaker 2>did him in.</v>

166
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:12.570
<v Speaker 1>Let me say two things about this.</v>

167
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:17.590
<v Speaker 1>One is I hope common sense and the other is pretty provocative but common sense</v>

168
00:06:18.831 --> 00:06:19.130
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

169
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:24.130
<v Speaker 1>We had to be very careful when we have these discussions not to devalue the</v>

170
00:06:24.771 --> 00:06:29.420
<v Speaker 1>human dignity of people who aren't in the upper end of the distribution.</v>

171
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:34.820
<v Speaker 1>And if there's one criticism that I think is fair as sometimes in these</v>

172
00:06:34.821 --> 00:06:35.780
<v Speaker 1>conversations,</v>

173
00:06:35.781 --> 00:06:40.781
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like we're devaluing people at the lower end and the distribution and</v>

174
00:06:42.111 --> 00:06:44.360
<v Speaker 1>we have to be very careful that we don't do that.</v>

175
00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:49.810
<v Speaker 1>A human life has dignity and Iq was not the most important thing that defines</v>

176
00:06:51.051 --> 00:06:52.610
<v Speaker 1>human gifts and beams.</v>

177
00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:53.410
<v Speaker 1>EAGAN,</v>

178
00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:53.560
<v Speaker 1>it's</v>

179
00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.150
<v Speaker 2>not associated with wisdom.</v>

180
00:06:55.151 --> 00:06:59.560
<v Speaker 2>It's not necessarily associated with truth or with courage or with many virtues</v>

181
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:00.523
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

182
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.310
<v Speaker 2>you like it at all with being likable there or on time.</v>

183
00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.070
<v Speaker 2>How many of all,</v>

184
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:09.590
<v Speaker 2>we know the psychometric test,</v>

185
00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.120
<v Speaker 2>the psychometric relationship between intelligence and conscientiousness is</v>

186
00:07:13.121 --> 00:07:13.954
<v Speaker 2>zero.</v>

187
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:14.793
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

188
00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.390
<v Speaker 2>We have to make that point.</v>

189
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.340
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

190
00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:18.010
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

191
00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:18.843
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

192
00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:22.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to make the point about how difficult it is for people who are on the</v>

193
00:07:22.691 --> 00:07:25.320
<v Speaker 2>low end of the cognitive spectrum to survive in a,</v>

194
00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:27.250
<v Speaker 2>in an increasingly complex,</v>

195
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:29.470
<v Speaker 2>cognitively sophisticated environment.</v>

196
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:30.101
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

197
00:07:30.101 --> 00:07:31.600
<v Speaker 2>Your obs are just disappearing.</v>
