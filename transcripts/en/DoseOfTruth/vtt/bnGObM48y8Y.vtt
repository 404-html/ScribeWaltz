1
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:06.931
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2
00:00:06.931 --> 00:00:10.640
<v Speaker 1>my entire schooling and all my professors were,</v>

3
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.110
<v Speaker 1>each one of them was,</v>

4
00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:13.620
<v Speaker 1>I would say we're radically left.</v>

5
00:00:13.621 --> 00:00:15.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I had a central professor.</v>

6
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.710
<v Speaker 1>All my supervisors and colleagues have been very strong leftist,</v>

7
00:00:19.711 --> 00:00:22.350
<v Speaker 1>social justice warrior types of radical feminists.</v>

8
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.700
<v Speaker 1>And I always say to people that it astonishes me when,</v>

9
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.960
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

10
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.320
<v Speaker 1>that Laurie a video came out and those professors called showing your video</v>

11
00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:34.681
<v Speaker 1>quote Hitler.</v>

12
00:00:34.681 --> 00:00:38.790
<v Speaker 1>Like I was absolutely astonished because out of every professor I've ever had,</v>

13
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.740
<v Speaker 1>almost every person I've ever met.</v>

14
00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:43.380
<v Speaker 1>And these are very leftist people who clean compassion.</v>

15
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.890
<v Speaker 1>You have taken the strongest stance that of everyone I've ever met on atrocities</v>

16
00:00:49.171 --> 00:00:51.240
<v Speaker 1>of the 20th century Nazi Germany,</v>

17
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:52.321
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:53.790
<v Speaker 1>Stalin's regime.</v>

19
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:54.570
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

20
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.980
<v Speaker 1>what happened in the Soviet Union.</v>

21
00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.630
<v Speaker 1>You are always warning people about the dangers of that path.</v>

22
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.490
<v Speaker 1>You are the one that writes about,</v>

23
00:01:02.491 --> 00:01:02.611
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

24
00:01:02.611 --> 00:01:03.421
<v Speaker 1>speaks about it,</v>

25
00:01:03.421 --> 00:01:04.201
<v Speaker 1>talks about it,</v>

26
00:01:04.201 --> 00:01:04.981
<v Speaker 1>tweets about it,</v>

27
00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:05.731
<v Speaker 1>emails about it,</v>

28
00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:09.090
<v Speaker 1>and yet you were referred to,</v>

29
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.960
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

30
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.500
<v Speaker 1>and compared to when most evil people in human history.</v>

31
00:01:13.501 --> 00:01:13.771
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

32
00:01:13.771 --> 00:01:14.604
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

33
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:15.000
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

34
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.571
<v Speaker 1>Einstein.</v>

35
00:01:15.571 --> 00:01:18.150
<v Speaker 1>But I'm wondering your feelings around that.</v>

36
00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.110
<v Speaker 2>Well at some point the accusations gets so absurd that it's just surreal.</v>

37
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.063
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

38
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.290
<v Speaker 2>You can't even take it personally because it's so crazy.</v>

39
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

40
00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:30.101
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

41
00:01:30.101 --> 00:01:35.101
<v Speaker 2>I've spent a lot of time talking to my students about and on videos about</v>

42
00:01:35.561 --> 00:01:36.101
<v Speaker 2>Stalin,</v>

43
00:01:36.101 --> 00:01:39.880
<v Speaker 2>but equal amounts of time talking about the Holocaust and Nazi Germany and</v>

44
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.090
<v Speaker 2>taking it apart and trying to indicate to people how lapses in personal</v>

45
00:01:46.121 --> 00:01:51.121
<v Speaker 2>responsibility paved the road for four totalitarian atrocity essentially.</v>

46
00:01:51.551 --> 00:01:52.361
<v Speaker 2>And yeah,</v>

47
00:01:52.361 --> 00:01:55.270
<v Speaker 2>it's really amazing to have done all that work.</v>

48
00:01:55.271 --> 00:01:59.410
<v Speaker 2>And then to be subject to that kind of,</v>

49
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.480
<v Speaker 2>what would you call it?</v>

50
00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.501
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

51
00:02:02.501 --> 00:02:03.880
<v Speaker 2>character assassination,</v>

52
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.740
<v Speaker 2>and it's even more amusing with,</v>

53
00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:06.603
<v Speaker 2>well the Wilford,</v>

54
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.220
<v Speaker 2>but what I've learned over the last year,</v>

55
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:10.390
<v Speaker 2>at least in part Serena,</v>

56
00:02:10.391 --> 00:02:13.150
<v Speaker 2>is that to be patient with this sort of thing,</v>

57
00:02:13.151 --> 00:02:16.690
<v Speaker 2>because what's happened so far is every time I've been attacked,</v>

58
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.480
<v Speaker 2>the attackers in validate themselves.</v>

59
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.771
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

60
00:02:20.771 --> 00:02:25.771
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I'm in a judo like position because I think it's in judo where your</v>

61
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.170
<v Speaker 2>attackers momentum against themselves,</v>

62
00:02:29.171 --> 00:02:30.670
<v Speaker 2>you just roll with the punches,</v>

63
00:02:30.671 --> 00:02:31.001
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

64
00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:33.340
<v Speaker 2>And that's worked out incredibly well.</v>

65
00:02:33.341 --> 00:02:38.320
<v Speaker 2>Wilfred Laurier is handling the Lindsay Shepherd affair so badly that you</v>

66
00:02:38.321 --> 00:02:40.060
<v Speaker 2>couldn't script it worse.</v>

67
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.070
<v Speaker 1>I was watching the agenda.</v>

68
00:02:43.071 --> 00:02:43.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

69
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.280
<v Speaker 1>I think you must have seen that episode where they had,</v>

70
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

71
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:47.820
<v Speaker 1>Janice Stein.</v>

72
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

73
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.430
<v Speaker 1>Professor Walcott.</v>

74
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.060
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

75
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.760
<v Speaker 1>of course your name came up and I was,</v>

76
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.580
<v Speaker 1>I was really hoping you were there to give your position,</v>

77
00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:56.803
<v Speaker 1>but I found</v>

78
00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm going on the agenda in January.</v>

79
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.221
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>

80
00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:02.080
<v Speaker 2>That's that they're going to grill me,</v>

81
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.000
<v Speaker 2>they're going to roast me over the coals.</v>

82
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.871
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

83
00:03:04.871 --> 00:03:06.220
<v Speaker 2>which is a good thing I think.</v>

84
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

85
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.900
<v Speaker 1>I was really surprised at the comment by Professor Walcott when he said,</v>

86
00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:15.901
<v Speaker 1>you're not an expert and you're not qualified to comment on the issues of gender</v>

87
00:03:16.841 --> 00:03:20.890
<v Speaker 1>or gender and sexual identities,</v>

88
00:03:20.891 --> 00:03:21.400
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

89
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.200
<v Speaker 1>But yet he is a black man,</v>

90
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.740
<v Speaker 1>is the director of the women's programs.</v>

91
00:03:25.741 --> 00:03:28.690
<v Speaker 1>So how is he qualified to be in that position as a male?</v>

92
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:29.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand that.</v>

93
00:03:29.921 --> 00:03:32.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand that inconsistent way of thinking.</v>

94
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:33.131
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

95
00:03:33.131 --> 00:03:33.964
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't,</v>

96
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.931
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

97
00:03:34.931 --> 00:03:38.560
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say that consistency is the hallmark of postmodern thinking.</v>

98
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.960
<v Speaker 2>It's whatever argument goes at the time.</v>

99
00:03:40.961 --> 00:03:41.441
<v Speaker 2>And Yeah,</v>

100
00:03:41.441 --> 00:03:45.670
<v Speaker 2>I thought w Walcott's performance on the agenda was absolutely reprehensible as</v>

101
00:03:45.671 --> 00:03:48.850
<v Speaker 2>well as his comments about the white Tas who were,</v>

102
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.590
<v Speaker 2>who were always oppressing,</v>

103
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

104
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.850
<v Speaker 2>professors of color to use those horrible,</v>

105
00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.860
<v Speaker 2>that horrible phrase ology that the radical left seems to insist upon.</v>

106
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.371
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

107
00:04:00.371 --> 00:04:04.630
<v Speaker 2>he described the University of Toronto was a white supremacist organization,</v>

108
00:04:04.631 --> 00:04:09.430
<v Speaker 2>I think four times failing to recognize entirely that he's hired in a very,</v>

109
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.300
<v Speaker 2>let's call it the privileged position at that university,</v>

110
00:04:13.301 --> 00:04:17.560
<v Speaker 2>and the mere fact of his positioning is indication for the fall.</v>

111
00:04:17.561 --> 00:04:18.670
<v Speaker 2>So of his claims.</v>

112
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.340
<v Speaker 2>Any sense would see</v>

113
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.540
<v Speaker 1>all you have to do is pick any building at u of t downtown and just go walk</v>

114
00:04:25.541 --> 00:04:26.380
<v Speaker 1>through the hallways.</v>

115
00:04:26.381 --> 00:04:30.200
<v Speaker 1>Anybody that suggests that it's a white supremacist institution is,</v>

116
00:04:30.201 --> 00:04:31.430
<v Speaker 1>is not thinking clearly.</v>

117
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.811
<v Speaker 1>They're out of there.</v>

118
00:04:31.811 --> 00:04:31.980
<v Speaker 1>Their</v>

119
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:32.401
<v Speaker 2>mind.</v>

120
00:04:32.401 --> 00:04:32.701
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

121
00:04:32.701 --> 00:04:37.701
<v Speaker 2>I was just at the university yesterday and I drove by a bunch of students who</v>

122
00:04:37.771 --> 00:04:41.910
<v Speaker 2>were standing outside waiting to take their exams and if anything,</v>

123
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.330
<v Speaker 2>the Caucasian kids were in the minority.</v>

124
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.770
<v Speaker 2>It's really true at the University of Toronto and increasingly true and very</v>

125
00:04:49.771 --> 00:04:50.670
<v Speaker 2>rapidly,</v>

126
00:04:50.671 --> 00:04:51.750
<v Speaker 2>increasingly true.</v>

127
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.160
<v Speaker 2>Certainly women or men are in the minority already out by a large margin,</v>

128
00:04:56.161 --> 00:04:58.590
<v Speaker 2>a dangerously large margin in my estimation,</v>

129
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.980
<v Speaker 2>but the idea that that that you could call it the University of Toronto,</v>

130
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.080
<v Speaker 2>which I think you'd have to think,</v>

131
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.550
<v Speaker 2>I really believe this,</v>

132
00:05:08.551 --> 00:05:13.551
<v Speaker 2>that you'd be hard pressed to go anywhere in the world and find an organization.</v>

133
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.240
<v Speaker 2>It's actually done a better job of integrating such a tremendously diverse range</v>

134
00:05:19.831 --> 00:05:23.520
<v Speaker 2>of people into a functioning unit in the University of Toronto.</v>

135
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.830
<v Speaker 2>I think you could just say some positive things about u of t two last year they</v>

136
00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.360
<v Speaker 2>wrote me a couple of letters asking me to keep my mouth shut basically,</v>

137
00:05:33.361 --> 00:05:36.300
<v Speaker 2>and which I think was a strategic error,</v>

138
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.670
<v Speaker 2>but they did host the debate afterwards,</v>

139
00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:40.620
<v Speaker 2>which was a good thing.</v>

140
00:05:40.621 --> 00:05:44.490
<v Speaker 2>And I would also say that the University of Toronto seems to have come down</v>

141
00:05:44.491 --> 00:05:47.190
<v Speaker 2>pretty firmly on the side of free speech since then.</v>

142
00:05:47.191 --> 00:05:52.020
<v Speaker 2>And I also feel that my position there as a professor is in no danger</v>

143
00:05:52.021 --> 00:05:52.740
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever,</v>

144
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:53.910
<v Speaker 2>despite the fact that,</v>

145
