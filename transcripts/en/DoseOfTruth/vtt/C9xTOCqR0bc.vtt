00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:06.921
<v Speaker 1>Here's a,</v>

2
00:00:06.921 --> 00:00:08.090
<v Speaker 1>here's a counter example.</v>

3
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.340
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you're trying to smoke,</v>

4
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:11.540
<v Speaker 1>trying to quit smoking,</v>

5
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.490
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to quit smoking.</v>

6
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.353
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

7
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:15.440
<v Speaker 1>And your friends smoke.</v>

8
00:00:15.441 --> 00:00:15.681
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

9
00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:19.880
<v Speaker 1>so what do they do it like do they offer you a cigarette at every possible</v>

10
00:00:19.881 --> 00:00:20.481
<v Speaker 1>opportunity?</v>

11
00:00:20.481 --> 00:00:21.500
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's very common.</v>

12
00:00:21.501 --> 00:00:22.790
<v Speaker 1>People do that very commonly.</v>

13
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.923
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

14
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.190
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe they're mad that maybe they're mad that they can put smoking or maybe</v>

15
00:00:28.191 --> 00:00:29.380
<v Speaker 1>if you quit and they didn't,</v>

16
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.660
<v Speaker 1>that would cast a bit them in a bad shadow.</v>

17
00:00:31.661 --> 00:00:35.450
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe they're just being malevolent or maybe it's a game or whatever.</v>

18
00:00:35.451 --> 00:00:39.920
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things it isn't is in the best interest of the person who's</v>

19
00:00:39.921 --> 00:00:44.160
<v Speaker 1>trying to quit smoking or drinking or eating or you know,</v>

20
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.470
<v Speaker 1>or behaving in any sort of dismal manner that's self defeating across time.</v>

21
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.330
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that,</v>

22
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.003
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.300
<v Speaker 1>I had a client just a while back and he was talking about an older sibling and</v>

24
00:00:58.911 --> 00:01:02.030
<v Speaker 1>he used to make these models very complicated,</v>

25
00:01:02.031 --> 00:01:03.890
<v Speaker 1>more so he was quite young at this time.</v>

26
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.230
<v Speaker 1>His sibling was like a decade and a half older.</v>

27
00:01:06.231 --> 00:01:08.150
<v Speaker 1>So he was like 10 or something like that.</v>

28
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.250
<v Speaker 1>Make these really complex models.</v>

29
00:01:10.251 --> 00:01:14.120
<v Speaker 1>He'd spend a couple of weeks building them and then when the older sibling came</v>

30
00:01:14.121 --> 00:01:15.470
<v Speaker 1>in and he just smashed them up,</v>

31
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.290
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

32
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.441
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

33
00:01:16.441 --> 00:01:19.010
<v Speaker 1>let's see what kind of stress this thing can take.</v>

34
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.371
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

35
00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:20.204
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

36
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.070
<v Speaker 1>what's going on there?</v>

37
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.791
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

38
00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:27.791
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say it's unconditional positive regard with the aim of encouraging</v>

39
00:01:27.981 --> 00:01:29.720
<v Speaker 1>the person and bringing them to fruition.</v>

40
00:01:29.721 --> 00:01:33.410
<v Speaker 1>It's quite the opposite and it's an instrumental use of action.</v>

41
00:01:33.411 --> 00:01:37.700
<v Speaker 1>It send the point is not to elevate me or you or both of us.</v>

42
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.720
<v Speaker 1>The point is I'm going to be the monster at the top of the hierarchy.</v>

43
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.730
<v Speaker 1>If you're all crunched up and lying at the bottom,</v>

44
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:44.870
<v Speaker 1>that's just fine.</v>

45
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.480
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very common set of motivations.</v>

46
00:01:47.481 --> 00:01:48.410
<v Speaker 1>And you might ask,</v>

47
00:01:48.411 --> 00:01:48.531
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

48
00:01:48.531 --> 00:01:50.030
<v Speaker 1>why isn't that okay?</v>

49
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:51.021
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

50
00:01:51.021 --> 00:01:51.920
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>

51
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.750
<v Speaker 1>I think the right answer to that is,</v>

52
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.030
<v Speaker 1>as a long run game,</v>

53
00:01:56.031 --> 00:01:57.050
<v Speaker 1>it's counterproductive.</v>

54
00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.360
<v Speaker 1>No one benefits.</v>

55
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.220
<v Speaker 1>So there's local benefits to you for the short in the short term.</v>

56
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.210
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
