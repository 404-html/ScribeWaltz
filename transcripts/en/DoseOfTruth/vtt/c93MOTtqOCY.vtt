1
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.110
<v Speaker 1>This is an interesting thing to know.</v>

2
00:00:04.111 --> 00:00:05.790
<v Speaker 1>It's called the binomial effect size.</v>

3
00:00:05.791 --> 00:00:09.240
<v Speaker 1>Display effect size is the magnitude of an effect,</v>

4
00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:09.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:09.920
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

6
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.110
<v Speaker 1>and it's not an easy thing to get a handle on all that you really need to if</v>

7
00:00:13.111 --> 00:00:17.460
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be a psychologist because in any study there's an effect size</v>

8
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.280
<v Speaker 1>indicator correlation off often r and r squared,</v>

9
00:00:20.281 --> 00:00:23.180
<v Speaker 1>which is the correlation squared or a Cohen's d which has uh,</v>

10
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.850
<v Speaker 1>the effect size expressed in standard deviation.</v>

11
00:00:25.851 --> 00:00:26.730
<v Speaker 1>So something like that,</v>

12
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.960
<v Speaker 1>but you kind of have to understand that at a basic level to understand what</v>

13
00:00:30.961 --> 00:00:32.130
<v Speaker 1>statistics actually do.</v>

14
00:00:32.131 --> 00:00:36.210
<v Speaker 1>And there's this phenomenon called the binomial effect size display that can</v>

15
00:00:36.211 --> 00:00:39.990
<v Speaker 1>help you understand what like an embodied sense,</v>

16
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.420
<v Speaker 1>what the magnitude of a correlation means.</v>

17
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.680
<v Speaker 1>So here's how it works.</v>

18
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.520
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that you have a predictor of 0.2.</v>

19
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.590
<v Speaker 1>So the correlation is r equals 0.2 between um,</v>

20
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.710
<v Speaker 1>phenomena one we'll say conscientiousness and phenomena two workplace</v>

21
00:00:55.711 --> 00:00:57.720
<v Speaker 1>performance 0.2 correlation.</v>

22
00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.100
<v Speaker 1>The question might be,</v>

23
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.263
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

24
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.970
<v Speaker 1>how much,</v>

25
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.750
<v Speaker 1>how much would you improve your predictive capacity over chance levels if you</v>

26
00:01:09.241 --> 00:01:10.560
<v Speaker 1>applied that predictor?</v>

27
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.760
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is that the ar is the difference between the odds ratio.</v>

28
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:15.870
<v Speaker 1>So let me explain that.</v>

29
00:01:15.871 --> 00:01:20.190
<v Speaker 1>So 0.5 0.5 if you subtract one from the another,</v>

30
00:01:20.191 --> 00:01:25.191
<v Speaker 1>you get zero so the predictive validity of selection by chance is 0.5 minus 0.5</v>

31
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.330
<v Speaker 1>equals zero that's the predictive validity of chance.</v>

32
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.800
<v Speaker 1>If you have a predictor of 0.2 which is approximately,</v>

33
00:01:34.801 --> 00:01:37.260
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of the low end estimate for conscientiousness,</v>

34
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.530
<v Speaker 1>then that would change your odds ratio from 0.5 0.5 right random 2.6 0.4 because</v>

35
00:01:45.601 --> 00:01:50.601
<v Speaker 1>0.6 minus 0.4 is 0.2 and so the correlation coefficient turns out to be the the</v>

36
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.020
<v Speaker 1>difference between the odds between the odds so and so it gives you a quick rule</v>

37
00:01:58.021 --> 00:01:58.381
<v Speaker 1>of thumb.</v>

38
00:01:58.381 --> 00:01:59.220
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

39
00:01:59.221 --> 00:02:04.221
<v Speaker 1>so if you have a 0.2 predictor that gives you a 60 40 you have a 0.3 predictor</v>

40
00:02:04.651 --> 00:02:09.651
<v Speaker 1>that gives you 65 35 because 0.65 minus 0.35 is 0.3 and if you have a 0.6</v>

41
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.253
<v Speaker 1>predictor,</v>

42
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.790
<v Speaker 1>which is really up on the high end,</v>

43
00:02:14.791 --> 00:02:15.001
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

44
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:17.750
<v Speaker 1>you're really starting to push your the limits of statistical prediction,</v>

45
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.830
<v Speaker 1>prediction validity at that point.</v>

46
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.580
<v Speaker 1>That gives you a 0.8 minus 0.2 and so what you've done,</v>

47
00:02:23.581 --> 00:02:24.690
<v Speaker 1>if you use a predictive,</v>

48
00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.880
<v Speaker 1>a predictor that has a correlation Coefficient of 0.6 which you could get for</v>

49
00:02:29.881 --> 00:02:30.301
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

50
00:02:30.301 --> 00:02:34.410
<v Speaker 1>if you took conscientiousness and combine that with a good test of Iq for</v>

51
00:02:34.411 --> 00:02:35.670
<v Speaker 1>predicting complex jobs,</v>

52
00:02:35.671 --> 00:02:39.480
<v Speaker 1>you might be able to get up to 0.6 that moves your odds ratio of selecting an</v>

53
00:02:39.481 --> 00:02:44.481
<v Speaker 1>above average person for the position from 0.5 0.5 to 0.8 0.2 so it cuts here</v>

54
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.350
<v Speaker 1>your failure rate by more than half,</v>

55
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.750
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

56
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.750
<v Speaker 1>It brings it down from 0.5 0.2 because 0.8 minus 0.2 0.6 so that's a really good</v>

57
00:02:56.521 --> 00:02:56.941
<v Speaker 1>thing to know.</v>

58
00:02:56.941 --> 00:02:58.800
<v Speaker 1>That's called the binomial effect size display.</v>

59
00:02:58.801 --> 00:03:00.310
<v Speaker 1>It's good thing to have in your mind.</v>

60
00:03:00.311 --> 00:03:01.061
<v Speaker 1>It's very simple.</v>

61
00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:01.894
<v Speaker 1>It's just a,</v>

62
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.680
<v Speaker 1>it's just subtraction and it gives you some sense of the power of,</v>

63
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.880
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

64
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.230
<v Speaker 1>of statistical prediction.</v>

65
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.450
<v Speaker 1>Now the question might be,</v>

66
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.811
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

67
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:13.900
<v Speaker 1>let's say you had a predictor of 0.2 the conscientiousness,</v>

68
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.651
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

69
00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:15.401
<v Speaker 1>well if you square,</v>

70
00:03:15.401 --> 00:03:16.234
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>

71
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.010
<v Speaker 1>that gives you 4% of the variance.</v>

72
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.970
<v Speaker 1>Like who the hell cares?</v>

73
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.560
<v Speaker 1>4% of the variance.</v>

74
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.800
<v Speaker 1>You've left 95% of the variability between people in terms of their performance</v>

75
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:27.323
<v Speaker 1>unexplained.</v>

76
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.031
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>

77
00:03:28.031 --> 00:03:28.181
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

78
00:03:28.181 --> 00:03:29.140
<v Speaker 1>why even bother?</v>

79
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.650
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

80
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.650
<v Speaker 1>the answer to that question is how much difference in productive output is there</v>

81
00:03:35.231 --> 00:03:36.064
<v Speaker 1>between people?</v>

82
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.130
<v Speaker 1>Because if there's a tremendous degree of productive,</v>

83
00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.680
<v Speaker 1>of difference in productive output between people,</v>

84
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.210
<v Speaker 1>then increasing your ability to predict someone's performance even by some</v>

85
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.260
<v Speaker 1>relatively small increment might have massive economic utility.</v>

86
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.831
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

87
00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:51.030
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

88
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.030
<v Speaker 1>if let's say the top 10% of your people are 50 times as productive as the bottom</v>

89
00:03:56.171 --> 00:03:57.340
<v Speaker 1>10% of your people,</v>

90
00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.820
<v Speaker 1>then shifting your ability to predict up so that you have more of those</v>

91
00:04:00.821 --> 00:04:04.470
<v Speaker 1>extremely high performing people or less of the extremely low performing PR</v>

92
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.940
<v Speaker 1>people might more than pay off,</v>

93
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.570
<v Speaker 1>might more than pay for itself from an economic perspective.</v>

94
00:04:10.571 --> 00:04:11.710
<v Speaker 1>Even though your prediction,</v>

95
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.030
<v Speaker 1>your predictor isn't,</v>

96
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.930
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have that massive amount of power when that actually happens to be</v>

97
00:04:16.931 --> 00:04:17.530
<v Speaker 1>the case.</v>

98
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.530
<v Speaker 1>So back in 1968 there was a guy named Walter Michelle,</v>

99
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:21.491
<v Speaker 1>he had reviewed,</v>

100
00:04:21.491 --> 00:04:22.600
<v Speaker 1>he's a social psychologist.</v>

101
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.710
<v Speaker 1>He reviewed the personality literature up to that point and concluded that the</v>

102
00:04:26.711 --> 00:04:31.711
<v Speaker 1>typical personality measure only predicted the typical performance measure at</v>

103
00:04:31.811 --> 00:04:34.870
<v Speaker 1>about 0.2 and that's actually remained relatively stable.</v>

104
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.290
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's a little higher than that.</v>

105
00:04:36.291 --> 00:04:40.000
<v Speaker 1>It's probably 0.25 especially if you do things like correct for measurement</v>

106
00:04:40.001 --> 00:04:40.870
<v Speaker 1>error and so forth.</v>

107
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.310
<v Speaker 1>And what Michelle said was,</v>

108
00:04:42.311 --> 00:04:45.760
<v Speaker 1>because it's only 0.25 let's say you square that,</v>

109
00:04:45.761 --> 00:04:47.350
<v Speaker 1>that's 5% of the variants.</v>

110
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.170
<v Speaker 1>You leave 95% of the phenomena unexplained,</v>

111
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.990
<v Speaker 1>you might as well not even bother measuring personality.</v>

112
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.830
<v Speaker 1>And so that actually killed the field of personality from a psychometric</v>

113
00:04:56.831 --> 00:05:01.330
<v Speaker 1>perspective for about 25 years really until about the early 1990s when people</v>

114
00:05:01.331 --> 00:05:02.170
<v Speaker 1>woke up and thought,</v>

115
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:03.063
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

116
00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.810
<v Speaker 1>what are the typical effect sizes in other domains of prediction?</v>

117
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.340
<v Speaker 1>And then they found out that,</v>

118
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.970
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

119
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.680
<v Speaker 1>the 0.2 correlation that was typical of personality prediction was actually</v>

120
00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:18.850
<v Speaker 1>pretty damn good by social sciences or health sciences standards.</v>

121
00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.720
<v Speaker 1>Like it doesn't sound good when you just think about it as an absolute measure</v>

122
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.900
<v Speaker 1>because it leaves 95% of the phenomena unexplained.</v>

123
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.620
<v Speaker 1>But when you compare it to other things that people consider of reasonable</v>

124
00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:33.910
<v Speaker 1>magnitude than it turns out that personality psychologists are doing just fine.</v>

125
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.160
<v Speaker 1>And then also in the 1990s and I'll show you some of this there,</v>

126
00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.250
<v Speaker 1>economic calculations done and the,</v>

127
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.750
<v Speaker 1>so one of the calculations would be,</v>

128
00:05:40.751 --> 00:05:42.700
<v Speaker 1>well imagine that you have,</v>

129
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:48.030
<v Speaker 1>maybe it took 20 companies and you did it a distribution of the productivity of</v>

130
00:05:48.221 --> 00:05:48.970
<v Speaker 1>their employees.</v>

131
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.340
<v Speaker 1>It's hard thing to do because you have to measure their productivity.</v>

132
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.720
<v Speaker 1>It's like how the hell do you do that?</v>

133
00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:53.230
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

134
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.981
<v Speaker 1>With salespeople,</v>

135
00:05:53.981 --> 00:05:55.150
<v Speaker 1>you can measure sales.</v>

136
00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.700
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty straight forward with you can measure hours billed.</v>

137
00:05:58.701 --> 00:05:59.534
<v Speaker 1>Like there are some,</v>

138
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.500
<v Speaker 1>there are some occupations where the performance measure is sort of built into</v>

139
00:06:03.501 --> 00:06:04.250
<v Speaker 1>the job.</v>

140
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.580
<v Speaker 1>But if you're a manager in the mid level of a large corporation,</v>

141
00:06:07.581 --> 00:06:09.560
<v Speaker 1>how the hell can you tell how productive you are?</v>

142
00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:14.360
<v Speaker 1>So there's a measurement problem on the productivity measurement and as well as</v>

143
00:06:14.361 --> 00:06:16.190
<v Speaker 1>the performance prediction and,</v>

144
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.701
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

145
00:06:16.701 --> 00:06:18.230
<v Speaker 1>it's a very intractable problem.</v>

146
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.750
<v Speaker 1>And the way that people often do that is by saying,</v>

147
00:06:20.751 --> 00:06:23.720
<v Speaker 1>well let's say you're a manager in the mid level of a corporation.</v>

148
00:06:23.721 --> 00:06:25.430
<v Speaker 1>How do we determine how productive we are?</v>

149
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:26.150
<v Speaker 1>You are,</v>

150
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.361
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

151
00:06:26.361 --> 00:06:30.890
<v Speaker 1>we might ask you to compare your work productivity with your peers,</v>

152
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.760
<v Speaker 1>maybe construct up a questionnaire asking about your efficient use of time and</v>

153
00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:35.594
<v Speaker 1>so forth.</v>

154
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.300
<v Speaker 1>And then we might get your peers to do the same thing to you.</v>

155
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.230
<v Speaker 1>We might get your supervisors to do the same thing to you and we might get your,</v>

156
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.800
<v Speaker 1>your subordinates to do the same thing to you and then aggregate across all</v>

157
00:06:45.801 --> 00:06:50.801
<v Speaker 1>those measures and infer that that aggregate opinion actually constitutes a</v>

158
00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:52.640
<v Speaker 1>valid measure of productivity.</v>

159
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.200
<v Speaker 1>You actually don't know,</v>

160
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:54.561
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

161
00:06:54.561 --> 00:06:58.610
<v Speaker 1>because that assumes that what you're doing that your peers and your supervisors</v>

162
00:06:58.611 --> 00:06:59.444
<v Speaker 1>and so forth,</v>

163
00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:03.980
<v Speaker 1>our rating is actually related in some positive manner to the bottom line of the</v>

164
00:07:03.981 --> 00:07:05.240
<v Speaker 1>company and you actually don't,</v>

165
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:06.830
<v Speaker 1>you actually can't figure that out.</v>

166
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:07.851
<v Speaker 1>This is actually,</v>

167
00:07:07.851 --> 00:07:12.290
<v Speaker 1>I think why why large companies start to become unstable is because if there's</v>

168
00:07:12.291 --> 00:07:16.700
<v Speaker 1>enough layers between the operations of the people in the tears of the</v>

169
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:19.970
<v Speaker 1>corporation and the real outcome measure,</v>

170
00:07:19.971 --> 00:07:22.730
<v Speaker 1>which is basically profit because that's what we've got.</v>

171
00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:24.230
<v Speaker 1>Then the,</v>

172
00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.790
<v Speaker 1>the relationship between your activity as a manager and the productivity of the</v>

173
00:07:28.791 --> 00:07:32.480
<v Speaker 1>company starts to become increasingly blurred and that might mean that you're</v>

174
00:07:32.481 --> 00:07:35.690
<v Speaker 1>working as hard as you can on something that's actually going to cost the</v>

175
00:07:35.691 --> 00:07:36.524
<v Speaker 1>company money.</v>

176
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:40.550
<v Speaker 1>So you would actually be much more productive from a profit perspective if he</v>

177
00:07:40.551 --> 00:07:44.480
<v Speaker 1>just didn't go to work at all and that that happens a lot in large corporations</v>

178
00:07:44.481 --> 00:07:45.770
<v Speaker 1>because you'd never know,</v>

179
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.910
<v Speaker 1>especially if there's a lot of steps that have to be undertaken in a process</v>

180
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.550
<v Speaker 1>before you can test the product in the market.</v>

181
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:56.570
<v Speaker 1>You have no idea if you're wasting time and resources you just can't tell.</v>

182
00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.240
<v Speaker 1>So the performance measurement issue is a very,</v>

183
00:07:59.241 --> 00:08:00.290
<v Speaker 1>very complicated one.</v>

184
00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:01.940
<v Speaker 1>We haven't talked about it that much,</v>

185
00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:04.130
<v Speaker 1>but I give you a kind of a brief overview of it.</v>

186
00:08:04.131 --> 00:08:08.510
<v Speaker 1>Now what you really want to do is have multiple sources of information about</v>

187
00:08:08.511 --> 00:08:12.110
<v Speaker 1>performance and aggregate across them and if you can use real world measures</v>

188
00:08:12.111 --> 00:08:14.780
<v Speaker 1>that are tied to two income generation,</v>

189
00:08:14.781 --> 00:08:18.050
<v Speaker 1>so much the better because you have to use something as your gold standard,</v>

190
00:08:18.051 --> 00:08:18.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

191
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:20.000
<v Speaker 1>You have to say at some point,</v>

192
00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:20.381
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

193
00:08:20.381 --> 00:08:24.560
<v Speaker 1>we're going to define this as reality when it comes to performance and in a free</v>

194
00:08:24.561 --> 00:08:25.371
<v Speaker 1>market economy,</v>

195
00:08:25.371 --> 00:08:29.000
<v Speaker 1>roughly what you do there is you say that what profit is the proxy for</v>

196
00:08:29.001 --> 00:08:29.834
<v Speaker 1>productivity,</v>

197
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:33.590
<v Speaker 1>and that isn't the same thing saying is that it isn't the same thing as saying</v>

198
00:08:33.591 --> 00:08:36.200
<v Speaker 1>that profit is productivity.</v>

199
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:37.640
<v Speaker 1>That's not the same thing.</v>

200
00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:41.780
<v Speaker 1>It's saying that at some point you have to decide what you're going to accept as</v>

201
00:08:41.781 --> 00:08:44.870
<v Speaker 1>a measure of productivity because otherwise there's no point in even talking</v>

202
00:08:44.871 --> 00:08:49.850
<v Speaker 1>about it and you can't just not talk about productivity if you're running an</v>

203
00:08:49.851 --> 00:08:54.140
<v Speaker 1>organization because the organization doesn't exist unless it produces something</v>

204
00:08:54.141 --> 00:08:55.220
<v Speaker 1>that we'll keep it going.</v>

205
00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:57.200
<v Speaker 1>And generally that happens to be money.</v>
