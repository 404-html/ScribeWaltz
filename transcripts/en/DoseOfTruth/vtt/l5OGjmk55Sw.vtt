00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:03.250
<v Speaker 1>My girlfriend is quite overweight,</v>

2
00:00:03.251 --> 00:00:04.120
<v Speaker 1>but I really love her.</v>

3
00:00:04.121 --> 00:00:06.070
<v Speaker 1>Should I try to encourage her to lose weight?</v>

4
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.810
<v Speaker 1>Aside from personal preference,</v>

5
00:00:07.811 --> 00:00:10.660
<v Speaker 1>is this likely to explode into a major issue down the road?</v>

6
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that you can fool yourself about what you're attracted to and yes,</v>

7
00:00:22.191 --> 00:00:25.250
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly likely to develop into a major issue down the road.</v>

8
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.593
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

9
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:27.830
<v Speaker 1>it's tough,</v>

10
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:28.693
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.400
<v Speaker 1>because it's so,</v>

13
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:33.903
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

14
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.350
<v Speaker 1>The devil's in the details,</v>

15
00:00:35.351 --> 00:00:35.621
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:35.621 --> 00:00:37.660
<v Speaker 1>should you try to encourage her to lose weight?</v>

17
00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.020
<v Speaker 1>I guess the question is how would you do that without disrupting the</v>

18
00:00:41.021 --> 00:00:41.854
<v Speaker 1>relationship?</v>

19
00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:43.263
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

20
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.950
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

21
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.290
<v Speaker 1>and without knowing more about the details of that,</v>

22
00:00:46.291 --> 00:00:50.700
<v Speaker 1>I would say that I don't know how to tell what to tell you to do about that.</v>

23
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.740
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's necessary to be truthful in a relationship period.</v>

24
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.740
<v Speaker 1>But I also think that you can't use the truth to hurt,</v>

25
00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:59.191
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:00:59.191 --> 00:01:01.260
<v Speaker 1>the truth is a very complicated thing and it's,</v>

27
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.580
<v Speaker 1>it's a sword and it cuts and you can't use it to hurt.</v>

28
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.750
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

29
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.081
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

30
00:01:07.081 --> 00:01:10.320
<v Speaker 1>maybe you would be subtle enough to figure out some way that you could both</v>

31
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.750
<v Speaker 1>embark on a health promoting endeavored together and that would work out.</v>

32
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

33
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:17.940
<v Speaker 1>but I would say,</v>

34
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.271
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:01:18.271 --> 00:01:19.104
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

36
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.290
<v Speaker 1>if you're in a stable long term relationship with someone,</v>

37
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.150
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty much necessary for both of you to address all the issues that are</v>

38
00:01:27.151 --> 00:01:29.430
<v Speaker 1>making you unhappy with each other.</v>

39
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

40
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:30.961
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:01:30.961 --> 00:01:35.310
<v Speaker 1>assuming there's some give and take on that because otherwise the relationship</v>

42
00:01:35.311 --> 00:01:37.350
<v Speaker 1>can easily come apart at the seams.</v>

43
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.580
<v Speaker 1>Like I would say my wife and I are both very hard on each other about our</v>

44
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.140
<v Speaker 1>physical appearance,</v>

45
00:01:43.141 --> 00:01:43.561
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

46
00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:47.730
<v Speaker 1>And I had gained a fair bit of weight from the time I was say 40 until the time</v>

47
00:01:47.731 --> 00:01:51.060
<v Speaker 1>I was 50 about probably because I was eating things that weren't good for me.</v>

48
00:01:51.061 --> 00:01:53.190
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that was primarily carbohydrates.</v>

49
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.930
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you if you want to lose weight,</v>

50
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.460
<v Speaker 1>you stop eating carbohydrates,</v>

51
00:01:56.461 --> 00:01:56.730
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

52
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:57.361
<v Speaker 1>you'll lose weight.</v>

53
00:01:57.361 --> 00:01:58.290
<v Speaker 1>Like you wouldn't believe.</v>

54
00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.021
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

55
00:01:59.021 --> 00:02:01.740
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't necessarily recommend it because it has some dangerous,</v>

56
00:02:01.741 --> 00:02:02.820
<v Speaker 1>but it certainly works.</v>

57
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.080
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

58
00:02:04.081 --> 00:02:04.914
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

59
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.810
<v Speaker 1>the alternative to protect to the alternative is to pretend that everything's</v>

60
00:02:09.811 --> 00:02:10.231
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

61
00:02:10.231 --> 00:02:13.410
<v Speaker 1>And all that means is that you're likely to get drunk sometimes and some day and</v>

62
00:02:13.411 --> 00:02:15.510
<v Speaker 1>have an affair out of bitterness and spite,</v>

63
00:02:15.511 --> 00:02:17.790
<v Speaker 1>and the fact that you're no longer attracted to your partner.</v>

64
00:02:17.791 --> 00:02:19.890
<v Speaker 1>So it's pretty rough.</v>

65
00:02:19.891 --> 00:02:22.200
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty rough way of thinking about things,</v>

66
00:02:22.201 --> 00:02:23.220
<v Speaker 1>but life's pretty rough.</v>

67
00:02:23.221 --> 00:02:23.550
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
