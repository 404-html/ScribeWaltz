1
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.870
<v Speaker 1>Nisha was a devastating critic of,</v>

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.200
<v Speaker 1>I would say dogmatic Christianity,</v>

3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.050
<v Speaker 1>Christianity as it was instantiated in institutions,</v>

4
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.160
<v Speaker 1>I suppose.</v>

5
00:00:11.161 --> 00:00:11.671
<v Speaker 1>Although he,</v>

6
00:00:11.671 --> 00:00:14.850
<v Speaker 1>he's a very paradoxical thinker because for example,</v>

7
00:00:14.851 --> 00:00:19.140
<v Speaker 1>one of the things neat just said was that he didn't believe that the scientific</v>

8
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.120
<v Speaker 1>revolution would have ever got off the ground if it hadn't been for Christianity</v>

9
00:00:24.121 --> 00:00:29.121
<v Speaker 1>and more specifically for Catholicism because he believed that over the course</v>

10
00:00:29.251 --> 00:00:32.370
<v Speaker 1>of really a thousand years,</v>

11
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.620
<v Speaker 1>the European mind,</v>

12
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.150
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

13
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.080
<v Speaker 1>had to train itself to interpret everything that was known within a single</v>

14
00:00:44.251 --> 00:00:45.720
<v Speaker 1>coherent framework,</v>

15
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.630
<v Speaker 1>coherent if you accept the initial axioms,</v>

16
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.040
<v Speaker 1>a single coherent framework and so neat,</v>

17
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.920
<v Speaker 1>you believe that that Catholicism Nation of,</v>

18
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.130
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

19
00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:00.130
<v Speaker 1>of the phenomena of life and of history produced the kind of mine that was then</v>

20
00:01:00.511 --> 00:01:05.511
<v Speaker 1>capable of transcending that it's dogmatic foundations and then concentrating on</v>

21
00:01:05.971 --> 00:01:06.571
<v Speaker 1>something else,</v>

22
00:01:06.571 --> 00:01:09.840
<v Speaker 1>which in this particular case happened to be the natural world.</v>

23
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:10.950
<v Speaker 1>And so Nietzsche,</v>

24
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.160
<v Speaker 1>you believe that in some sense Christianity died at its own hand.</v>

25
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.550
<v Speaker 1>It had spent a very long period of time trying to attune people to the necessity</v>

26
00:01:19.861 --> 00:01:20.700
<v Speaker 1>of the truth.</v>

27
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.051
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

28
00:01:22.051 --> 00:01:23.940
<v Speaker 1>absent the corruption and all of that,</v>

29
00:01:23.941 --> 00:01:26.130
<v Speaker 1>that's always part of any human endeavor.</v>

30
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.720
<v Speaker 1>And then the truth,</v>

31
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.800
<v Speaker 1>the spirit of the truth that was developed by Christianity turned on the roots</v>

32
00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:32.611
<v Speaker 1>of Christianity.</v>

33
00:01:32.611 --> 00:01:35.220
<v Speaker 1>And everyone woke up and said something like,</v>

34
00:01:35.221 --> 00:01:36.120
<v Speaker 1>or thought something like,</v>

35
00:01:36.121 --> 00:01:38.520
<v Speaker 1>well how is it that we came to believe any of this?</v>

36
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.273
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

37
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.200
<v Speaker 1>it's like waking up one day and noting,</v>

38
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.790
<v Speaker 1>noting that you really don't know why you put a Christmas tree up,</v>

39
00:01:44.791 --> 00:01:46.470
<v Speaker 1>but you've been doing it for a long time.</v>

40
00:01:46.471 --> 00:01:47.940
<v Speaker 1>And that's what people do.</v>

41
00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:49.080
<v Speaker 1>And in know,</v>

42
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.390
<v Speaker 1>there are reasons that Christmas trees came about,</v>

43
00:01:51.391 --> 00:01:53.580
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

44
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.601
<v Speaker 1>what would you say?</v>

45
00:01:54.601 --> 00:01:58.500
<v Speaker 1>The ritual lasts long after the reasons have been forgotten.</v>

46
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.550
<v Speaker 1>So now Nicha although he was a critic of Christianity and also a champion of,</v>

47
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.930
<v Speaker 1>of its disciplinary capacity,</v>

48
00:02:09.931 --> 00:02:10.531
<v Speaker 1>because you see,</v>

49
00:02:10.531 --> 00:02:14.070
<v Speaker 1>the other thing that needs you believed was that it was not possible to be free</v>

50
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.031
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>

51
00:02:15.031 --> 00:02:15.864
<v Speaker 1>unless you,</v>

52
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.270
<v Speaker 1>unless you had been a slave.</v>

53
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.740
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

54
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.740
<v Speaker 1>and by that he meant that you don't go from childhood to full fledged adult</v>

55
00:02:24.271 --> 00:02:25.470
<v Speaker 1>individuality.</v>

56
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.130
<v Speaker 1>You go from childhood to a state of discipline,</v>

57
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.310
<v Speaker 1>which you might think is akin to slavery,</v>

58
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.200
<v Speaker 1>to self imposed slavery,</v>

59
00:02:34.201 --> 00:02:38.790
<v Speaker 1>that that would be the best scenario where you have to discipline yourself to</v>

60
00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:43.791
<v Speaker 1>become something specific before you might be able to retain the generality that</v>

61
00:02:43.921 --> 00:02:45.870
<v Speaker 1>you had as a child.</v>

62
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.530
<v Speaker 1>And he believed that Christianity had played that role for Western civilization.</v>

63
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:53.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

64
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.720
<v Speaker 1>bought in the late 18 hundreds,</v>

65
00:02:54.721 --> 00:02:57.840
<v Speaker 1>he announced that God was dead.</v>

66
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.350
<v Speaker 1>And you often hear of that as something triumphant.</v>

67
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.440
<v Speaker 1>But for Nietzsche it wasn't because he was too nuanced.</v>

68
00:03:07.441 --> 00:03:09.400
<v Speaker 1>The thinker to be that simple minded,</v>

69
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.001
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

70
00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:10.261
<v Speaker 1>neat.</v>

71
00:03:10.261 --> 00:03:10.600
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

72
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.010
<v Speaker 1>Understood that this is something I'm going to try to make clear as that</v>

73
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:19.241
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

74
00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:19.521
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

75
00:03:19.521 --> 00:03:24.190
<v Speaker 1>there's a very large amount that we don't know about the structure of experience</v>

76
00:03:24.191 --> 00:03:29.191
<v Speaker 1>that we don't know about reality and we have our articulated representations of</v>

77
00:03:29.231 --> 00:03:29.980
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

78
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.930
<v Speaker 1>And then you can think of outside of that,</v>

79
00:03:31.931 --> 00:03:35.410
<v Speaker 1>there are things we know absolutely nothing about and there's a buffer between</v>

80
00:03:35.411 --> 00:03:36.070
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

81
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.370
<v Speaker 1>And those are the things we sort of know something about and we don't know them</v>

82
00:03:39.371 --> 00:03:40.780
<v Speaker 1>in an articulated way.</v>

83
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:41.770
<v Speaker 1>Here's an example.</v>

84
00:03:41.771 --> 00:03:42.011
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

85
00:03:42.011 --> 00:03:43.720
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you're arguing with one of your,</v>

86
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.730
<v Speaker 1>someone close to you and they're in a bad mood,</v>

87
00:03:45.731 --> 00:03:46.564
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

88
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:47.590
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

89
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.590
<v Speaker 1>they're being touchy and unreasonable and you keep the conversation up and maybe</v>

90
00:03:52.631 --> 00:03:53.620
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden they,</v>

91
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

92
00:03:53.921 --> 00:03:54.521
<v Speaker 1>they get angry.</v>

93
00:03:54.521 --> 00:03:57.730
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they cry and then when they cry they figure out what they're angry about.</v>

94
00:03:57.731 --> 00:04:00.760
<v Speaker 1>And it has nothing to do with you even though you might've been.</v>

95
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.260
<v Speaker 1>What precipitated the argument?</v>

96
00:04:02.261 --> 00:04:02.481
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

97
00:04:02.481 --> 00:04:05.770
<v Speaker 1>one that's an interesting phenomena as far as I'm concerned because it means</v>

98
00:04:05.771 --> 00:04:10.450
<v Speaker 1>that people can know things at one level without being able to speak what they</v>

99
00:04:10.451 --> 00:04:11.320
<v Speaker 1>know at another.</v>

100
00:04:11.321 --> 00:04:12.850
<v Speaker 1>And so in some sense,</v>

101
00:04:12.851 --> 00:04:17.430
<v Speaker 1>the thoughts rise up from the body and they do that in moods and they do that in</v>

102
00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.120
<v Speaker 1>images and they do that and actions.</v>

103
00:04:19.121 --> 00:04:24.121
<v Speaker 1>And we have all sorts of ways that we understand before we understand in a fully</v>

104
00:04:24.191 --> 00:04:25.420
<v Speaker 1>articulated manner.</v>

105
00:04:25.421 --> 00:04:29.650
<v Speaker 1>And so we have this articulated space that we can all discuss.</v>

106
00:04:29.651 --> 00:04:30.550
<v Speaker 1>And then outside of that,</v>

107
00:04:30.551 --> 00:04:34.160
<v Speaker 1>we have something that's more akin to a dream that we're embedded in.</v>

108
00:04:34.161 --> 00:04:36.730
<v Speaker 1>And it's an emotional dream that we're embedded in.</v>

109
00:04:36.731 --> 00:04:39.300
<v Speaker 1>And that's based at least in part on her actions.</v>

110
00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:40.480
<v Speaker 1>I'll describe that later.</v>

111
00:04:40.481 --> 00:04:43.600
<v Speaker 1>And then outside of that is what we don't know anything about at all.</v>

112
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.100
<v Speaker 1>And in that dream,</v>

113
00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.660
<v Speaker 1>that's where the mystics live and that's where the artists live and they're a</v>

114
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.530
<v Speaker 1>mediators between the absolute unknown and the things we know for sure.</v>

115
00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:54.703
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

116
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.883
<v Speaker 2>you see</v>

117
00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:02.140
<v Speaker 1>what that means in some sense is what we know is established on a form of</v>

118
00:05:02.391 --> 00:05:05.960
<v Speaker 1>knowledge that we don't really understand and that if those two things are out</v>

119
00:05:05.961 --> 00:05:06.501
<v Speaker 1>of sync,</v>

120
00:05:06.501 --> 00:05:10.430
<v Speaker 1>so you might say if our articulated knowledge is out of sync with our dream,</v>

121
00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.000
<v Speaker 1>then we become dissociated internally.</v>

122
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.860
<v Speaker 1>We think things we don't act out and we act out things we don't dream and that</v>

123
00:05:18.861 --> 00:05:23.861
<v Speaker 1>produces a kind of sickness of the spirit and and that sickness of the spirit it</v>

124
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:26.060
<v Speaker 1>see it.</v>

125
00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:31.060
<v Speaker 1>It's cure is something like an integrated system of belief and representation.</v>

126
00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.600
<v Speaker 1>And then people turn to things like ideologies,</v>

127
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.870
<v Speaker 1>which I regardless parasites on an underlying religious substructure to try to</v>

128
00:05:38.871 --> 00:05:41.390
<v Speaker 1>organize their thinking and then that's a catastrophe.</v>

129
00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:42.560
<v Speaker 1>And that's what Nisha,</v>

130
00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:43.840
<v Speaker 1>Nisha foresaw.</v>

131
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:44.211
<v Speaker 1>You see?</v>

132
00:05:44.211 --> 00:05:48.470
<v Speaker 1>He knew that when we knocked the slats out of the base of Western civilization</v>

133
00:05:48.471 --> 00:05:50.870
<v Speaker 1>by destroying this representation,</v>

134
00:05:50.871 --> 00:05:52.580
<v Speaker 1>this is God ideal,</v>

135
00:05:52.581 --> 00:05:53.414
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

136
00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.810
<v Speaker 1>that we would destabilize and move back and forth.</v>

137
00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.411
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

138
00:05:57.411 --> 00:05:58.430
<v Speaker 1>between nihilism,</v>

139
00:05:58.431 --> 00:06:00.290
<v Speaker 1>let's say in the extremes of videology,</v>

140
00:06:00.291 --> 00:06:05.291
<v Speaker 1>he was particularly concerned about radical left ideology and no one believed in</v>

141
00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.990
<v Speaker 1>it and predicted this in the late 18 hundreds which is really an absolute</v>

142
00:06:08.991 --> 00:06:09.920
