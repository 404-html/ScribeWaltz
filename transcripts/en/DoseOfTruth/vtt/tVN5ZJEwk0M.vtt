1
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.003
<v Speaker 1>So here we are.</v>

2
00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:09.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.390
<v Speaker 1>so I made a case tonight.</v>

4
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.890
<v Speaker 1>I'll go over it.</v>

5
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:12.760
<v Speaker 1>What's the case?</v>

6
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.290
<v Speaker 1>The postmodernist are wrong.</v>

7
00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.810
<v Speaker 1>They're philosophically naive.</v>

8
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.670
<v Speaker 1>They're right about an infinite number of interpretations and wrong about a</v>

9
00:00:25.671 --> 00:00:29.540
<v Speaker 1>finite number of viable interpretations and that's like that's,</v>

10
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:30.890
<v Speaker 1>that's death.</v>

11
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.310
<v Speaker 1>That's the end of postmodern is theory and that's not the only way in which</v>

12
00:00:34.311 --> 00:00:34.821
<v Speaker 1>they're wrong.</v>

13
00:00:34.821 --> 00:00:36.020
<v Speaker 1>They're wrong in a bunch of other ways,</v>

14
00:00:36.021 --> 00:00:37.250
<v Speaker 1>but they're more subsidiary.</v>

15
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:38.750
<v Speaker 1>The Marxists,</v>

16
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.140
<v Speaker 1>they're not just wrong,</v>

17
00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:44.660
<v Speaker 1>they're wrong and murderous or wrong,</v>

18
00:00:44.661 --> 00:00:46.190
<v Speaker 1>murderous and genocidal.</v>

19
00:00:46.191 --> 00:00:50.380
<v Speaker 1>Unless you think murderers and genocidal doesn't mean wrong and you,</v>

20
00:00:50.381 --> 00:00:53.960
<v Speaker 1>you can think that there's lots of would be revolutionaries who would be happy</v>

21
00:00:53.961 --> 00:00:57.980
<v Speaker 1>to have blood running in the street if they had their chance for revenge and the</v>

22
00:00:57.981 --> 00:01:01.790
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to move up the hierarchy of tyranny so you can,</v>

23
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.760
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to think that murder and genocide is wrong,</v>

24
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.320
<v Speaker 1>especially if the right people are murdered in genocide,</v>

25
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.581
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

26
00:01:07.581 --> 00:01:08.750
<v Speaker 1>That's actually part of it,</v>

27
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.610
<v Speaker 1>part of the whole equation.</v>

28
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.810
<v Speaker 1>But if you're willing to think that murder and genocide on a mass scale across</v>

29
00:01:14.811 --> 00:01:15.561
<v Speaker 1>many cultures,</v>

30
00:01:15.561 --> 00:01:17.900
<v Speaker 1>over many decades is wrong,</v>

31
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.570
<v Speaker 1>then Marxism is wrong.</v>

32
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.600
<v Speaker 1>And the postmodernist don't get to just come along.</v>

33
00:01:23.601 --> 00:01:28.550
<v Speaker 1>And a dog Marxism as a matter of sleight of hand because they're Marx's theory</v>

34
00:01:28.551 --> 00:01:30.830
<v Speaker 1>didn't work out and they figured out a rationalization.</v>

35
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.890
<v Speaker 1>They don't get to get away with that because it's too dangerous.</v>

36
00:01:33.891 --> 00:01:35.540
<v Speaker 1>It's too dangerous to the rest of us,</v>

37
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.340
<v Speaker 1>and we don't.</v>

38
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.720
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't necessary for us who are trying with the small part of our hearts</v>

39
00:01:46.331 --> 00:01:51.331
<v Speaker 1>that might be oriented towards the good to allow people who are manipulating us</v>

40
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.290
<v Speaker 1>with historical ignorance and philosophical sleight of hand to render us so God</v>

41
00:01:56.291 --> 00:01:59.560
<v Speaker 1>damn guilty about what our ancestors may or may not have done.</v>

42
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.380
<v Speaker 1>So that we allow our shame and our guilt to be,</v>

43
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.680
<v Speaker 1>to be used as tools to manipulate us into accepting a future that we do not want</v>

44
00:02:07.991 --> 00:02:08.824
<v Speaker 1>to have.</v>

45
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.720
<v Speaker 1>And that's that</v>

46
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.850
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
