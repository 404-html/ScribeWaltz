1
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.360
<v Speaker 1>Have you watched Rick and Morty?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.480
<v Speaker 1>I haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many people have told me to watch Rick</v>

3
00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:14.610
<v Speaker 1>and Morty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although they said it's very dark and</v>

4
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.860
<v Speaker 1>well that doesn't bother me so much I</v>
<v Speaker 1>suppose.</v>

5
00:00:16.861 --> 00:00:20.640
<v Speaker 1>Although I'm plenty dark perhaps without</v>
<v Speaker 1>adding too much.</v>

6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.020
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

7
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.420
<v Speaker 1>I would like to watch it and I probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>will.</v>

8
00:00:24.421 --> 00:00:27.990
<v Speaker 1>So I would love for you to do come and</v>
<v Speaker 1>do a talk in Montreal.</v>

9
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you never know what that might happen.</v>

10
00:00:29.521 --> 00:00:31.860
<v Speaker 1>I've been talking to God side of bolt</v>
<v Speaker 1>out a fair bit.</v>

11
00:00:31.861 --> 00:00:35.460
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's coming to Toronto November 11th so</v>

12
00:00:35.461 --> 00:00:38.760
<v Speaker 1>we can do the talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was shut down by Ryerson back in</v>

13
00:00:38.761 --> 00:00:40.950
<v Speaker 1>August.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm looking forward to that.</v>

14
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.353
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

15
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.250
<v Speaker 1>what's the best way to stop drinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol and start doing my best in my</v>

16
00:00:47.251 --> 00:00:49.740
<v Speaker 1>psychology degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's affecting my study,</v>

17
00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:53.040
<v Speaker 1>but I can do very well if I stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 26.</v>

18
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul,</v>

19
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.240
<v Speaker 1>what I would say is I think you should</v>
<v Speaker 1>do the future authoring program and you</v>

20
00:01:02.311 --> 00:01:05.760
<v Speaker 1>should really concentrate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a section in it that helps you</v>

21
00:01:05.761 --> 00:01:10.050
<v Speaker 1>determine what your positive view of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your future would be,</v>

22
00:01:10.051 --> 00:01:14.190
<v Speaker 1>but another section that helps you</v>
<v Speaker 1>determine what would happen in your life</v>

23
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.380
<v Speaker 1>if you're negative habits got out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

24
00:01:16.381 --> 00:01:20.730
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that can really</v>
<v Speaker 1>help you control your alcohol intake is</v>

25
00:01:20.731 --> 00:01:24.150
<v Speaker 1>to really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really think through what you're giving</v>

26
00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:27.420
<v Speaker 1>up and where you could be in five years</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't get it under control.</v>

27
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.580
<v Speaker 1>And proclivity to alcoholism can be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>really vicious thing.</v>

28
00:01:32.581 --> 00:01:35.010
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of people get dragged down into the</v>

29
00:01:35.011 --> 00:01:40.011
<v Speaker 1>mud by alcohol excess alcohol intake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're sensitive to the</v>

30
00:01:40.561 --> 00:01:42.840
<v Speaker 1>opiate response that alcohol can</v>
<v Speaker 1>produce.</v>

31
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.600
<v Speaker 1>You can tell that if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you drink,</v>

32
00:01:45.601 --> 00:01:47.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get alert and,</v>

33
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.360
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

34
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.930
<v Speaker 1>let's say more enthusiastic and</v>
<v Speaker 1>energetic and then you don't want to</v>

35
00:01:51.931 --> 00:01:53.410
<v Speaker 1>stop drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's uh,</v>

36
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.760
<v Speaker 1>that's definitely a bad sign with</v>
<v Speaker 1>regards to developing alcoholism.</v>

37
00:01:56.761 --> 00:02:00.340
<v Speaker 1>So I would say you need to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's,</v>

38
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.560
<v Speaker 1>that's more important to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that drinking and also think through</v>

39
00:02:04.561 --> 00:02:07.320
<v Speaker 1>very hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The negative consequences of continuing</v>

40
00:02:07.321 --> 00:02:07.681
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

41
00:02:07.681 --> 00:02:10.350
<v Speaker 1>you're at about the age 26 where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>should stop.</v>

42
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean guys who are going to stop</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally start slow down pretty,</v>

43
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.980
<v Speaker 1>pretty intensely around that age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

44
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get also treating your psychology,</v>

45
00:02:20.821 --> 00:02:23.490
<v Speaker 1>studying as a full time job can also be</v>
<v Speaker 1>helpful.</v>

46
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:24.540
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

47
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.600
<v Speaker 1>get up at eight in the morning or seven</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 in the morning and start hitting the</v>

48
00:02:27.601 --> 00:02:30.540
<v Speaker 1>books by nine and put in a six to eight</v>
<v Speaker 1>hour day.</v>

49
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.930
<v Speaker 1>And then even if you do keep drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least you're moving forward.</v>

50
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.300
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I can say about the APP.</v>

51
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.150
<v Speaker 1>Are you a science fiction fan?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You referenced timelines,</v>

52
00:02:42.151 --> 00:02:46.020
<v Speaker 1>starship troopers in a lecture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your ideas often remind me of Harry</v>

53
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.600
<v Speaker 1>Selden's plan from Asimov's foundation</v>
<v Speaker 1>series.</v>

54
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:49.321
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

55
00:02:49.321 --> 00:02:52.410
<v Speaker 1>when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is quite a long time ago now,</v>

56
00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lived in this town called Fairview,</v>

57
00:02:54.991 --> 00:02:58.140
<v Speaker 1>Alberta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was a town of about 3000 people</v>

58
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.370
<v Speaker 1>way the hell north 350 miles northwest</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Edmonton.</v>

59
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.540
<v Speaker 1>And I have this neighbor across the</v>
<v Speaker 1>street across the Ellie actually,</v>

60
00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:09.580
<v Speaker 1>and he had a huge science fiction</v>
<v Speaker 1>library.</v>

61
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.470
<v Speaker 1>It must've been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

62
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.590
<v Speaker 1>5,000 books there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1970s,</v>

63
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.750
<v Speaker 1>1960s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1970s classics,</v>

64
00:03:16.751 --> 00:03:20.470
<v Speaker 1>like Heinlein and Asimov.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he would let me go over there and</v>

65
00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:24.250
<v Speaker 1>take like 20 books at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was reading about a book a day at</v>

66
00:03:24.251 --> 00:03:26.830
<v Speaker 1>that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I read science fiction like mad</v>

67
00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:31.831
<v Speaker 1>probably till I was about 19 or so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe a little younger than that and</v>

68
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:34.940
<v Speaker 1>then turn more to classic literature</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I got to college.</v>

69
00:03:34.941 --> 00:03:36.130
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

70
00:03:36.131 --> 00:03:38.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also partly as a consequence of some</v>

71
00:03:38.471 --> 00:03:41.530
<v Speaker 1>lessons that the local library and</v>
<v Speaker 1>taught me about what to read.</v>

72
00:03:41.531 --> 00:03:44.670
<v Speaker 1>So I was a science fiction fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

73
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.380
<v Speaker 1>I haven't read science fiction for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very long time,</v>

74
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.930
<v Speaker 1>although I was pretty happy with it when</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a kid.</v>

75
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.980
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
