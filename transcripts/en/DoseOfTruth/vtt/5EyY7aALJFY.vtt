00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.200
<v Speaker 1>So niches idea was that human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have to create their own</v>

2
00:00:07.201 --> 00:00:10.770
<v Speaker 1>values essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he understood that we had bodies and</v>

3
00:00:10.771 --> 00:00:14.700
<v Speaker 1>that we had motivations and emotions</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he was a romantic thinker in some</v>

4
00:00:14.701 --> 00:00:16.800
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but way ahead of his time because he</v>

5
00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:20.940
<v Speaker 1>knew that our capacity to think wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>some free floating soul,</v>

6
00:00:20.941 --> 00:00:25.590
<v Speaker 1>but was embedded in our physiology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>constrained by our emotion,</v>

7
00:00:25.591 --> 00:00:27.780
<v Speaker 1>shaped by our motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shaped by our body.</v>

8
00:00:27.781 --> 00:00:31.020
<v Speaker 1>He understood that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he still believed that the only</v>

9
00:00:31.021 --> 00:00:35.850
<v Speaker 1>possible way out of the problem would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>for human beings themselves to become</v>

10
00:00:35.851 --> 00:00:39.210
<v Speaker 1>something akin to God and to create</v>
<v Speaker 1>their own values.</v>

11
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.730
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's and he thought that the person he</v>

12
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.570
<v Speaker 1>talked about the person who could create</v>
<v Speaker 1>their own values as the overmanned or</v>

13
00:00:45.571 --> 00:00:48.390
<v Speaker 1>the superman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was one of the parts of</v>

14
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.150
<v Speaker 1>Nietzschean philosophy that the Nazis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

15
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.160
<v Speaker 1>took out of context and used to fuel</v>
<v Speaker 1>their superior man ideology.</v>

16
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.920
<v Speaker 1>So we know what happened with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That didn't seem to turn out very well.</v>

17
00:01:01.921 --> 00:01:02.640
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>
