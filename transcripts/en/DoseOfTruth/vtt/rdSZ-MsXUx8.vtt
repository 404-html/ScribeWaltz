00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.010
<v Speaker 1>Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations.</v>

2
00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.480
<v Speaker 1>And Noah walked with God.</v>

3
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.320
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting line because if you remember back in the story of Adam and</v>

4
00:00:11.321 --> 00:00:12.040
<v Speaker 1>Eve,</v>

5
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.420
<v Speaker 1>what happens to Adam once he eats the fruit of the tree,</v>

6
00:00:16.421 --> 00:00:20.050
<v Speaker 1>of the knowledge of good and evil and wakes up the scales fall from his eyes,</v>

7
00:00:20.051 --> 00:00:21.220
<v Speaker 1>become self conscious,</v>

8
00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:24.940
<v Speaker 1>develops the knowledge of good and evil is he won't walk with God when God calls</v>

9
00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:25.774
<v Speaker 1>him in the garden.</v>

10
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.400
<v Speaker 1>And so Noah is Adam without the fall essentially.</v>

11
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.430
<v Speaker 1>And there's something that Noah is doing right that</v>

12
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.930
<v Speaker 1>motivates God to spare him or maybe to show him a pathway through the emergent</v>

13
00:00:40.931 --> 00:00:41.351
<v Speaker 1>chaos,</v>

14
00:00:41.351 --> 00:00:42.071
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

15
00:00:42.071 --> 00:00:47.071
<v Speaker 1>And that's worth thinking about a lot because there will be situations in your</v>

16
00:00:47.261 --> 00:00:50.320
<v Speaker 1>life where what you face is the emergent chaos.</v>

17
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.400
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that'll be some terrible catastrophe inside your family.</v>

18
00:00:54.401 --> 00:00:57.580
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe it'll be something that's occurring on a much broader social level.</v>

19
00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.850
<v Speaker 1>But the chaos is coming and what you're going to want to know unless you want to</v>

20
00:01:03.151 --> 00:01:05.910
<v Speaker 1>be a dentist and of the chaos or even a contributor to it.</v>

21
00:01:05.911 --> 00:01:09.360
<v Speaker 1>And perhaps that is what you want because many people under those circumstances</v>

22
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.470
<v Speaker 1>choose that.</v>

23
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.250
<v Speaker 1>What you want is to know</v>

24
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.310
<v Speaker 1>how you build an Ark and get through it.</v>

25
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.313
<v Speaker 1>That's what you,</v>

26
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.591
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

27
00:01:23.591 --> 00:01:25.060
<v Speaker 1>if you're interested in life,</v>

28
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.090
<v Speaker 1>if you're interested in proper being and you're disinclined to produce any more</v>

29
00:01:31.331 --> 00:01:31.781
<v Speaker 1>suffering,</v>

30
00:01:31.781 --> 00:01:32.561
<v Speaker 1>the necessary,</v>

31
00:01:32.561 --> 00:01:36.880
<v Speaker 1>then you want to know how to conduct yourself when the catastrophe comes so that</v>

32
00:01:36.881 --> 00:01:38.830
<v Speaker 1>you have a reasonable possibility of</v>

33
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:40.330
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

34
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.010
<v Speaker 1>of moving through it and,</v>

35
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.480
<v Speaker 1>and starting a new.</v>

36
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.040
<v Speaker 1>So when,</v>

37
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.010
<v Speaker 1>when this old story says,</v>

38
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:49.091
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

39
00:01:49.091 --> 00:01:51.310
<v Speaker 1>God's not happy and he's going to wipe everything out,</v>

40
00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:52.241
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

41
00:01:52.241 --> 00:01:52.421
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

42
00:01:52.421 --> 00:01:54.190
<v Speaker 1>you might want to take that seriously.</v>

43
00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.670
<v Speaker 1>And then when it says,</v>

44
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.570
<v Speaker 1>but there's one person who had a motive being that protected him from that.</v>

45
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.930
<v Speaker 1>That's also something you might want to take seriously because you might want to</v>

46
00:02:05.931 --> 00:02:09.050
<v Speaker 1>know what that mode of being is because you might need to use it.</v>

47
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.100
<v Speaker 1>And so these sorts of things are practical in the deepest possible sense.</v>

48
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.120
<v Speaker 1>They're real in the deepest possible sense and practical in the deepest possible</v>

49
00:02:17.121 --> 00:02:17.600
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
