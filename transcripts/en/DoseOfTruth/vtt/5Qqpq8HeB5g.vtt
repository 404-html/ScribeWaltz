1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:00.973
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

2
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.910
<v Speaker 1>there was one very important thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>had happened to me when I was 16 years</v>

3
00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:13.970
<v Speaker 1>old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though I was the popular kid in my</v>

4
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.380
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They voted me for two years in a row,</v>

5
00:00:16.381 --> 00:00:18.180
<v Speaker 1>the chairman of the programming</v>
<v Speaker 1>committee,</v>

6
00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:22.440
<v Speaker 1>which means I ran student assemblies</v>
<v Speaker 1>five days a week and I program to a</v>

7
00:00:22.441 --> 00:00:23.290
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

8
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.090
<v Speaker 1>so I was the emcee for these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one day the Jews.</v>

9
00:00:27.091 --> 00:00:30.150
<v Speaker 1>Did you manage that and simultaneously</v>
<v Speaker 1>be unpopular?</v>

10
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.070
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>

11
00:00:32.071 --> 00:00:35.220
<v Speaker 1>I think my school had very school was</v>
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>

12
00:00:35.221 --> 00:00:40.080
<v Speaker 1>was founded by an Acolyte of John Dewey</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was behind the scenes actually</v>

13
00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:42.590
<v Speaker 1>setting the school law and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.510
<v Speaker 1>schools have their popularity positions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>

15
00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:47.070
<v Speaker 1>vice president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>secretary,</v>

16
00:00:47.071 --> 00:00:48.420
<v Speaker 1>treasurer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>

17
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.720
<v Speaker 1>But my school was clever enough to start</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting functional team committees</v>

18
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.220
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In your very first days at school,</v>

19
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.550
<v Speaker 1>your very first day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

20
00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:58.480
<v Speaker 1>were a freshman year.</v>

21
00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.290
<v Speaker 1>Now when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have kids vote for president</v>

22
00:01:03.291 --> 00:01:06.470
<v Speaker 1>and vice president or an vote for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most popular kid in the school as the</v>

23
00:01:06.471 --> 00:01:08.870
<v Speaker 1>precedent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second most popular kid as vice</v>

24
00:01:08.871 --> 00:01:12.020
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most popular girl as secretary and</v>

25
00:01:12.021 --> 00:01:15.170
<v Speaker 1>the most popular Jewish treasurer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just the way it goes.</v>

26
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was never aligned for any of those</v>

27
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.750
<v Speaker 1>positions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had no popularity whatsoever.</v>

28
00:01:20.751 --> 00:01:23.750
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my classmates actually fired with</v>

29
00:01:23.751 --> 00:01:28.310
<v Speaker 1>remarkable accuracy from only 23 d way a</v>
<v Speaker 1>soccer ball directly into my face.</v>

30
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.690
<v Speaker 1>And believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has a lot of force distance of 20</v>

31
00:01:32.691 --> 00:01:33.760
<v Speaker 1>feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

32
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.710
<v Speaker 1>but when it comes to functional</v>
<v Speaker 1>positions,</v>

33
00:01:36.711 --> 00:01:39.230
<v Speaker 1>like how do we run these school</v>
<v Speaker 1>assemblies?</v>

34
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.700
<v Speaker 1>The popular kids don't have a clue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you bring them into a room,</v>

35
00:01:43.701 --> 00:01:45.410
<v Speaker 1>if there arbitrarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

36
00:01:45.411 --> 00:01:47.110
<v Speaker 1>assigned to a committee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

37
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.500
<v Speaker 1>they will all piss on there a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of territory.</v>

38
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.420
<v Speaker 1>They'll all stake out a position of some</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind just to establish their status in</v>

39
00:01:55.421 --> 00:01:57.490
<v Speaker 1>the room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And after 15 minutes.</v>

40
00:01:57.491 --> 00:01:59.960
<v Speaker 1>So this one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've all said their piece and it</v>

41
00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:02.690
<v Speaker 1>comes time to actually do something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are clueless,</v>

42
00:02:02.691 --> 00:02:04.700
<v Speaker 1>they're silent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know what to do.</v>

43
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.580
<v Speaker 1>And if there is an unpopular geek like</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

44
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.970
<v Speaker 1>who at that 20 minute mark all of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden has an idea,</v>

45
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.330
<v Speaker 1>they will glom around you even if they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't like you.</v>

46
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.640
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

47
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.060
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So competence can,</v>

48
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.870
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>

49
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.870
<v Speaker 1>can step in where we're popularity</v>
<v Speaker 1>cannot go.</v>

50
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.260
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very well put phrase.</v>

51
00:02:23.261 --> 00:02:26.000
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there I was the head of this</v>

52
00:02:26.001 --> 00:02:28.550
<v Speaker 1>programming committee and one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>kid,</v>

53
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.280
<v Speaker 1>one of the juniors came to me and said</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're doing a dance.</v>

54
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.570
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

55
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.810
<v Speaker 1>we're setting up a dance and could you</v>
<v Speaker 1>advertise it for us?</v>

56
00:02:35.811 --> 00:02:38.960
<v Speaker 1>And he didn't realize just how absurd</v>
<v Speaker 1>that statement was.</v>

57
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.470
<v Speaker 1>If there's a dance or a party of any</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind in buffalo,</v>

58
00:02:42.471 --> 00:02:44.210
<v Speaker 1>New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the first things you have to</v>

59
00:02:44.211 --> 00:02:48.020
<v Speaker 1>realize about it is I am not just</v>
<v Speaker 1>disinvited.</v>

60
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.590
<v Speaker 1>I haven't invited to stay as far away as</v>
<v Speaker 1>humanly possible and yet they want me to</v>

61
00:02:54.441 --> 00:02:56.570
<v Speaker 1>advertise this dance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Jordan,</v>

62
00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:57.800
<v Speaker 1>I can't dance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am,</v>

63
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.610
<v Speaker 1>I can't do a box step.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do a Fox trot,</v>

64
00:03:00.611 --> 00:03:02.920
<v Speaker 1>I can't do a waltz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do any of those things.</v>

65
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.330
<v Speaker 1>But I went onstage and put some music on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the turntable and danced,</v>

66
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.680
<v Speaker 1>and I saw the pupils dilating of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>

67
00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:15.040
<v Speaker 1>Three hundred 50 people who hated me and</v>
<v Speaker 1>hated me for two and a half years.</v>

68
00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:17.320
<v Speaker 1>At that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their pupils were dilating,</v>

69
00:03:17.321 --> 00:03:21.880
<v Speaker 1>their faces were melting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt that pseudopod at vantage coming</v>

70
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.310
<v Speaker 1>to me and through me as if I were a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pipe.</v>

71
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.610
<v Speaker 1>I felt it going up to something inside</v>
<v Speaker 1>of me more or less.</v>

72
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.610
<v Speaker 1>It had level that utterly transmogrified</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and I felt the energy being sent back</v>

73
00:03:32.681 --> 00:03:36.760
<v Speaker 1>through every move that I was making an</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had an outer body experience.</v>

74
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.730
<v Speaker 1>I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was on the ceiling.</v>

75
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.890
<v Speaker 1>I've watched all of this from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ceiling and it apparently it looked like</v>

76
00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:49.891
<v Speaker 1>a loony toon drawn on Lsd as if Chuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jones had been doing Tom and Jerry after</v>

77
00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:54.880
<v Speaker 1>taking a very big hit of acid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was one of the strangest,</v>

78
00:03:54.881 --> 00:03:57.910
<v Speaker 1>weirdest things you've ever seen and</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it was all over.</v>

79
00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.180
<v Speaker 1>So that was my ecstatic experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When it was all over,</v>

80
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.350
<v Speaker 1>the audience did something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It had never done in my days at school,</v>

81
00:04:04.351 --> 00:04:06.490
<v Speaker 1>I would never do again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so long as I was there,</v>

82
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.810
<v Speaker 1>it surged to the foot of the stage and</v>
<v Speaker 1>as if it had practice this act all its</v>

83
00:04:10.811 --> 00:04:12.970
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it picked me up off the stage,</v>

84
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.170
<v Speaker 1>it put me on his shoulders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it carried me out of the auditorium and</v>

85
00:04:17.171 --> 00:04:21.580
<v Speaker 1>it carried me up the pathway to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>building above where we had our classes.</v>

86
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.800
<v Speaker 1>So that was my introduction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

87
00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.130
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is a crazy story,</v>

88
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.030
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is three years after I'd gone</v>

89
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.240
<v Speaker 1>off after the ecstatic experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing that it was something vital.</v>

90
00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:35.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd heard at the age of 14,</v>

91
00:04:35.861 --> 00:04:38.530
<v Speaker 1>two years earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had heard that there was a book called</v>

92
00:04:38.531 --> 00:04:43.090
<v Speaker 1>the varieties of religious experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in those days we had no Amazon.</v>

93
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.650
<v Speaker 1>We had local bookstores and local</v>
<v Speaker 1>bookstores in Buffalo.</v>

94
00:04:47.651 --> 00:04:48.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give me a break.</v>

95
00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.900
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I finally found a copy at the</v>

96
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.600
<v Speaker 1>University of Buffalo Bookstore and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>felt as if William James had been laying</v>

97
00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.660
<v Speaker 1>out a series of examples of the ecstatic</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience with all of its delusions and</v>

98
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.610
<v Speaker 1>hallucinations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all the rest on the laboratory bench</v>

99
00:05:06.611 --> 00:05:08.770
<v Speaker 1>and then saying to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

100
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.040
<v Speaker 1>you're coming along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>70 years later you're going to have</v>

101
00:05:12.041 --> 00:05:16.030
<v Speaker 1>scientific tools that I did not have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is your job.</v>

102
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.670
<v Speaker 1>And it was my job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just because William James was</v>

103
00:05:18.671 --> 00:05:22.090
<v Speaker 1>giving it to me because something deep</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside of him he was crying out to</v>

104
00:05:22.091 --> 00:05:22.990
<v Speaker 1>understand it.</v>

105
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:28.230
<v Speaker 1>And it probably was that the privilege</v>
<v Speaker 1>of social disconnection,</v>

106
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.490
<v Speaker 1>the privilege of social deprivation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that privilege made me sensitive</v>

107
00:05:33.491 --> 00:05:35.950
<v Speaker 1>and it's always made me sensitive to</v>
<v Speaker 1>group behavior.</v>

108
00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:41.290
<v Speaker 1>So when I was in Moscow in 2005</v>
<v Speaker 1>lecturing a group of quantum physicists</v>

109
00:05:42.431 --> 00:05:45.580
<v Speaker 1>from all over the world on why</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything you know about quantum</v>

110
00:05:45.581 --> 00:05:48.340
<v Speaker 1>physics does wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because there is no such thing as</v>

111
00:05:48.341 --> 00:05:51.370
<v Speaker 1>an isolated particle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every particle is part of our herd,</v>

112
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.680
<v Speaker 1>a mob,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a group of some kind.</v>

113
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

114
00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.920
<v Speaker 1>a lot of quantum physicists on the idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>that when you,</v>

115
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.140
<v Speaker 1>when you treat a Photon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a single photon in a certain way,</v>

116
00:06:03.141 --> 00:06:05.760
<v Speaker 1>when you split it into here's how it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be,</v>

117
00:06:05.761 --> 00:06:08.480
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it's being measured,</v>

118
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.250
<v Speaker 1>that's not going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

119
00:06:10.251 --> 00:06:12.530
<v Speaker 1>guess what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're constantly taking each other's</v>

120
00:06:12.531 --> 00:06:15.110
<v Speaker 1>measure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Photons are constantly taking each</v>

121
00:06:15.111 --> 00:06:16.880
<v Speaker 1>other's measure because they move in</v>
<v Speaker 1>groups,</v>

122
00:06:16.881 --> 00:06:17.870
<v Speaker 1>crowds and herds.</v>

123
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.080
<v Speaker 1>That's why a beam of sunshine comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>through your window,</v>

124
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.610
<v Speaker 1>not a photon of sunshine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I finished the speech,</v>

125
00:06:25.611 --> 00:06:29.780
<v Speaker 1>I was sure they were gonna throw me out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the conference because these are all</v>

126
00:06:29.781 --> 00:06:33.860
<v Speaker 1>people committed deeply to quantum</v>
<v Speaker 1>physics and instead they sat there</v>

127
00:06:33.861 --> 00:06:38.330
<v Speaker 1>beaming like a proud uncles and I could</v>
<v Speaker 1>not figure out why.</v>

128
00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:43.331
<v Speaker 1>And three years later my collaborator in</v>
<v Speaker 1>quantum physics at the university at the</v>

129
00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.500
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] Institute of Applied</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mathematics,</v>

130
00:06:45.501 --> 00:06:49.340
<v Speaker 1>so the Russian Academy of Sciences in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moscow Senate email and he said,</v>

131
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.910
<v Speaker 1>Dr,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use your club who ran that conference</v>

132
00:06:52.911 --> 00:06:55.100
<v Speaker 1>and gave you such a hard time about your</v>
<v Speaker 1>credit card.</v>

133
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.460
<v Speaker 1>Has just published a book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a new approach to quantum physics.</v>

134
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.210
<v Speaker 1>It's called constructive of physics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to get it immediately.</v>

135
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:07.310
<v Speaker 1>So I downloaded it from arcserve org.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I listened to it that afternoon on my</v>

136
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:11.090
<v Speaker 1>hour and a half walk through the park on</v>
<v Speaker 1>my way to the cafe where I do all my</v>

137
00:07:11.091 --> 00:07:14.900
<v Speaker 1>work and I got all excited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every social concept.</v>

138
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:20.170
<v Speaker 1>That means every concept that I had</v>
<v Speaker 1>given in this talk was in this book.</v>

139
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.200
<v Speaker 1>So Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had the privilege of proceedings</v>

140
00:07:25.201 --> 00:07:29.360
<v Speaker 1>through life with this enormous</v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage social deprivation.</v>
