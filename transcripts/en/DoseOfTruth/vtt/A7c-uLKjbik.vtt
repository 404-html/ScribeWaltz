1
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.990
<v Speaker 1>It seems we you're bound to repeat history and what his old becomes new again.</v>

2
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.440
<v Speaker 1>Why is it that we can't seem to find equilibrium within a society?</v>

3
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.780
<v Speaker 1>Ideas begin with good intentions,</v>

4
00:00:16.781 --> 00:00:18.220
<v Speaker 1>but lead towards the extreme.</v>

5
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.061
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6
00:00:19.061 --> 00:00:19.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

7
00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.440
<v Speaker 1>the reason that we can't find equilibrium is because the environment that we</v>

8
00:00:23.441 --> 00:00:25.000
<v Speaker 1>live in isn't an equilibrium.</v>

9
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.193
<v Speaker 1>And so I,</v>

10
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.790
<v Speaker 1>I kind of imagine it this way.</v>

11
00:00:27.791 --> 00:00:28.870
<v Speaker 1>It's like we're,</v>

12
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.390
<v Speaker 1>we're traversing the back of a giant,</v>

13
00:00:31.391 --> 00:00:34.930
<v Speaker 1>this is obviously a symbolic reference of the giant serpent and it's,</v>

14
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.400
<v Speaker 1>and it weaves back and forth and you don't know at any moment which way it's</v>

15
00:00:39.401 --> 00:00:40.690
<v Speaker 1>going to curve and turn.</v>

16
00:00:40.691 --> 00:00:44.470
<v Speaker 1>And so sometimes it turns to the right and sometimes it turns to the left.</v>

17
00:00:44.471 --> 00:00:47.770
<v Speaker 1>And what that means politically is that sometime we have to turn to the right</v>

18
00:00:47.771 --> 00:00:49.600
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes we have to turn to the left.</v>

19
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.840
<v Speaker 1>And we don't know exactly when those,</v>

20
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:53.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

21
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:54.783
<v Speaker 1>what new call,</v>

22
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.190
<v Speaker 1>we don't know exactly how to time that.</v>

23
00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.790
<v Speaker 1>And so what we all have to do is keep our eyes open and tell the truth and</v>

24
00:01:00.791 --> 00:01:02.190
<v Speaker 1>discuss things with each other that are,</v>

25
00:01:02.191 --> 00:01:05.410
<v Speaker 1>especially with people who have political beliefs that are different than us,</v>

26
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.820
<v Speaker 1>so that we can ensure that we haven't tilted too far one way or the other.</v>

27
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.380
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I'm an advocate of free speech or one of the many reasons I'm an</v>

28
00:01:14.381 --> 00:01:18.910
<v Speaker 1>advocate of free speech is because it's the continual dialogue between people of</v>

29
00:01:18.911 --> 00:01:23.230
<v Speaker 1>different temperamental types that keeps us oriented as close as we can come to</v>

30
00:01:23.231 --> 00:01:25.180
<v Speaker 1>the center of the serpents back.</v>

31
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.490
<v Speaker 1>And so there is no permanent equilibrium.</v>

32
00:01:27.491 --> 00:01:31.450
<v Speaker 1>There's only the equilibrium that's produced by continual negotiation and a</v>

33
00:01:31.451 --> 00:01:34.270
<v Speaker 1>democracy is a formalized negotiation.</v>

34
00:01:34.271 --> 00:01:35.104
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

35
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.263
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

36
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.840
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

37
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.081
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

38
00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:39.610
<v Speaker 1>and it's free speech that keeps it healthy and alive.</v>

39
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.473
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

40
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.350
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

41
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.920
<v Speaker 1>there's no permanent equivalent equilibrium state except death,</v>

42
00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:45.341
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:01:45.341 --> 00:01:45.580
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

44
00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.730
<v Speaker 1>and it's always negotiation in relationships too.</v>

45
00:01:48.731 --> 00:01:52.600
<v Speaker 1>Like if you have an intimate relationship or a familial relationship or even a</v>

46
00:01:52.601 --> 00:01:53.434
<v Speaker 1>friendship,</v>

47
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.240
<v Speaker 1>there's no final equilibrium state.</v>

48
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.280
<v Speaker 1>You have to communicate with each other honestly,</v>

49
00:01:57.281 --> 00:01:58.114
<v Speaker 1>all the time,</v>

50
00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.800
<v Speaker 1>and keep the relationship moving to adjust the environment that the relationship</v>

51
00:02:02.801 --> 00:02:03.730
<v Speaker 1>is operating in.</v>

52
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.410
<v Speaker 1>That's how it stays alive.</v>

53
00:02:05.411 --> 00:02:06.520
<v Speaker 1>And in an intimate,</v>

54
00:02:06.521 --> 00:02:07.000
<v Speaker 1>longterm,</v>

55
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.020
<v Speaker 1>intimate relationship,</v>

56
00:02:08.021 --> 00:02:08.711
<v Speaker 1>like a marriage,</v>

57
00:02:08.711 --> 00:02:09.850
<v Speaker 1>it's a continual,</v>

58
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

59
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.190
<v Speaker 1>it takes continual effort.</v>

60
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.580
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

61
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.791
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

62
00:02:12.791 --> 00:02:14.020
<v Speaker 1>it's worthwhile effort and,</v>

63
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.501
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>

64
00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:18.280
<v Speaker 1>but you have to be conscious and awake to keep your relationship alive and you</v>

65
00:02:18.281 --> 00:02:19.930
<v Speaker 1>have to be communicating all the time.</v>

66
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.651
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

67
00:02:20.651 --> 00:02:23.440
<v Speaker 1>maybe not all the time because you can over communicate to,</v>

68
00:02:23.441 --> 00:02:24.274
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

69
00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.263
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

70
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.853
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

71
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.820
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

72
00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.660
<v Speaker 1>so that's why we can't reach a state of permanent equilibrium.</v>
