00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.770
<v Speaker 1>Taking your time to</v>

2
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.520
<v Speaker 1>do some ideas.</v>

3
00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:17.703
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:20.263
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

5
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.950
<v Speaker 1>it's great.</v>

6
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.410
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to Dave backstage.</v>

7
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.110
<v Speaker 1>We'd be trying to get our heads around some of this and we were talking about</v>

8
00:00:30.891 --> 00:00:34.640
<v Speaker 1>this idea that when scientists look forward,</v>

9
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.500
<v Speaker 1>the intellectual dark,</v>

10
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.670
<v Speaker 1>we were trying to figure out what it wants to do all them a in common,</v>

11
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.633
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.240
<v Speaker 1>people on that list ferry sometimes insight on</v>

13
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.653
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan,</v>

14
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.390
<v Speaker 1>Dave and me and the Weinstein brothers,</v>

15
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.100
<v Speaker 1>a handful of other people,</v>

16
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.820
<v Speaker 1>and then one thing I can really think of the United States is that we don't</v>

17
00:00:58.821 --> 00:00:59.680
<v Speaker 1>think you're stupid.</v>

18
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.760
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is</v>

19
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.960
<v Speaker 1>because there's no reason to treat</v>

20
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.300
<v Speaker 1>an audience attempted to assume.</v>

21
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.320
<v Speaker 1>Then that works to assume that people aren't capable of operating at a high</v>

22
00:01:22.161 --> 00:01:27.161
<v Speaker 1>intellectual level to be compelling as participate genuinely in soft,</v>

23
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.870
<v Speaker 1>simple discussion and perhaps discussion that even goes deeper than that.</v>

24
00:01:32.871 --> 00:01:37.390
<v Speaker 1>Then it looks like there's a real hunger for that in the real demand for it</v>

25
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.340
<v Speaker 1>because you know you're not stupid.</v>

26
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.750
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

27
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.150
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to talk to you about tonight,</v>

28
00:01:54.151 --> 00:01:58.620
<v Speaker 1>but not exactly because what I want to talk to you about is the thing is that</v>

29
00:01:58.621 --> 00:02:02.460
<v Speaker 1>I've been thinking about the same topics,</v>

30
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.930
<v Speaker 1>but since I wrote the book,</v>

31
00:02:03.931 --> 00:02:08.931
<v Speaker 1>because I'm always thinking about golf and I don't like to use sad because</v>

32
00:02:09.391 --> 00:02:11.370
<v Speaker 1>they're complex ideas,</v>

33
00:02:11.371 --> 00:02:13.650
<v Speaker 1>not because because it's the topics,</v>

34
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.430
<v Speaker 1>they be continual development,</v>

35
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.040
<v Speaker 1>continual articulation,</v>

36
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.530
<v Speaker 1>continual reformulation.</v>

37
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.451
<v Speaker 1>So we'll stop there.</v>

38
00:02:21.451 --> 00:02:23.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to walk from the rules one by one.</v>

39
00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:23.934
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many,</v>

40
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.433
<v Speaker 1>but enough</v>

41
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.100
<v Speaker 1>to stand up straight.</v>

42
00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.830
<v Speaker 1>Shoulders back.</v>

43
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.700
<v Speaker 1>In some sense.</v>

44
00:02:34.701 --> 00:02:38.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say to a limited degree on someone like me,</v>

45
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:39.653
<v Speaker 1>I suppose</v>

46
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.790
<v Speaker 1>I have heard about hierarchies.</v>

47
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.320
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that one of the things I was trying to point out,</v>

48
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.820
<v Speaker 1>which I believe to be</v>

49
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.580
<v Speaker 1>remarkably worth knowing.</v>

50
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.153
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

51
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.710
<v Speaker 1>hierarchical structures are extraordinary.</v>

52
00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:00.743
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

53
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.110
<v Speaker 1>if you looked at any critiques of Modern Society Inboxes,</v>

54
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.610
<v Speaker 1>critiques,</v>

55
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.140
<v Speaker 1>let's be more precise because the left has its purposes and all get to that</v>

56
00:03:11.141 --> 00:03:11.410
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>

57
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.780
<v Speaker 1>But mom,</v>

58
00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:12.730
<v Speaker 1>sister takes</v>

59
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:15.220
<v Speaker 1>the boxes,</v>

60
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.060
<v Speaker 1>are very much concerned about the detrimental consequences of hierarchies and</v>

61
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.120
<v Speaker 1>mostly what they're concerned about to give the devil his due,</v>

62
00:03:22.121 --> 00:03:22.954
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

63
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.100
<v Speaker 1>is the fact that if you have a hierarchy that people tend to stack up with the</v>

64
00:03:27.101 --> 00:03:29.470
<v Speaker 1>blog and that's true,</v>

65
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:30.850
<v Speaker 1>that that is what happens.</v>

66
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.400
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

67
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.350
<v Speaker 1>It's a well documented effect.</v>

68
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.570
<v Speaker 1>Success tends to become disproportionate and forth.</v>

69
00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.550
<v Speaker 1>People Stack up at zero and so there's a big price to be paid for hierarchies.</v>

70
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.660
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with the Marxist is that they placed it.</v>

71
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.080
<v Speaker 1>They attribute a causes of hierarchy to the wrong reasons and by doing that they</v>

72
00:03:54.521 --> 00:03:58.540
<v Speaker 1>do a disservice to the very people that they purport to help.</v>

73
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.550
<v Speaker 1>So if you lay the problem of hierarchy at the feet of western civilization,</v>

74
00:04:03.551 --> 00:04:06.240
<v Speaker 1>say or capitalism,</v>

75
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.210
<v Speaker 1>then you're way off the mark and Ashley dependable.</v>

76
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.350
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I wrote about lobsters in chapter one because the fact that</v>

77
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.400
<v Speaker 1>animals who are inclined to live in social groups spontaneously organize</v>

78
00:04:24.641 --> 00:04:26.060
<v Speaker 1>themselves into hierarchies,</v>

79
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.430
<v Speaker 1>doesn't justify the existence of hierarchies ethically.</v>

80
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.740
<v Speaker 1>And that wasn't the point I was trying to make,</v>

81
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.660
<v Speaker 1>but it certainly doesn't disprove the idea that there would be laid at the feet</v>

82
00:04:37.661 --> 00:04:42.661
<v Speaker 1>of western civilization or capitalism because monsters are not part of Western</v>

83
00:04:43.151 --> 00:04:45.720
<v Speaker 1>civilization and they're not capitalists.</v>

84
00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.290
<v Speaker 1>That was part of a point.</v>

85
00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.350
<v Speaker 1>It's actually really a problem when you construct a hierarchy that people stack</v>

86
00:04:53.351 --> 00:04:54.184
<v Speaker 1>up at the bar.</v>

87
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:55.400
<v Speaker 1>It's an issue.</v>

88
00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.400
<v Speaker 1>It's a serious problem and it's a serious enough submitted it repeatedly estabil</v>

89
00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.550
<v Speaker 1>destabilizes civilizations.</v>

90
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.393
<v Speaker 1>In the past,</v>

91
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.740
<v Speaker 1>even if you look back in the Old Testament,</v>

92
00:05:05.741 --> 00:05:09.960
<v Speaker 1>when the prophets announced their opposition to the Hebrew case,</v>

93
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.560
<v Speaker 1>one of the constant complaints about the kings who became Arabic was that they</v>

94
00:05:14.561 --> 00:05:17.320
<v Speaker 1>weren't paying enough attention to the windows and the children right to the</v>

95
00:05:17.321 --> 00:05:19.750
<v Speaker 1>dispossessed and so the profits would emerge and say,</v>

96
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:20.603
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

97
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.990
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

98
00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.060
<v Speaker 1>you don't get it.</v>

99
00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.740
<v Speaker 1>You're society is destabilizing in an unusual way.</v>

100
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.250
<v Speaker 1>And that's an indication that it's going to fall.</v>

101
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.290
<v Speaker 1>And then it actually happens to be the case.</v>

102
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.280
<v Speaker 1>And so the fact that people stack up at the bottom has to be contended with</v>

103
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:41.180
<v Speaker 1>because if the inequality distribution gets to steep than the whole society</v>

104
00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.780
<v Speaker 1>stabilizes and that was a very bad thing,</v>

105
00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:45.560
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that</v>

106
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:51.460
<v Speaker 1>that still doesn't mean that you could lay the issue of hierarchy at the feet of</v>

107
00:05:51.461 --> 00:05:53.170
<v Speaker 1>western civilization or capitalism.</v>

108
00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:56.920
<v Speaker 1>A good book that was published recently and somebody to be interviewing in the</v>

109
00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:57.753
<v Speaker 1>next.</v>

110
00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.960
<v Speaker 1>He wrote a book called the great leveler and he did it in technical analysis of</v>

111
00:06:04.311 --> 00:06:08.590
<v Speaker 1>inequality and so what are the things he did was mattress that you surveyed a</v>

112
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.810
<v Speaker 1>variety of left wing governments in a variety of what great we'd governments and</v>

113
00:06:11.811 --> 00:06:14.030
<v Speaker 1>you've calculated the need for warranty coefficients,</v>

114
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:15.670
<v Speaker 1>which you do often,</v>

115
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.840
<v Speaker 1>something called the Gini Coefficient tissues.</v>

116
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.100
<v Speaker 1>Then you can determine whether the left wing governments tend to produce</v>

117
00:06:22.101 --> 00:06:25.510
<v Speaker 1>societies that have more or less equal tonight Greek governments.</v>

118
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.400
<v Speaker 1>What shutting off from was that there was no effect whatsoever of political</v>

119
00:06:28.401 --> 00:06:33.401
<v Speaker 1>ideology on inequality was a zero and that's actually quite sad in some sense</v>

120
00:06:33.501 --> 00:06:35.180
<v Speaker 1>because given a left wing,</v>

121
00:06:35.181 --> 00:06:39.890
<v Speaker 1>governments are attempting to rectify inequality and inequality actually happens</v>

122
00:06:39.891 --> 00:06:40.760
<v Speaker 1>to be a problem.</v>

123
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.960
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't actually be optimistic at least to something intensive analysis if</v>

124
00:06:44.961 --> 00:06:47.810
<v Speaker 1>there were to be in a relationship so that the left wing governments work,</v>

125
00:06:47.811 --> 00:06:50.630
<v Speaker 1>in fact presentable for societies that kindness and equality,</v>

126
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:53.180
<v Speaker 1>but that's what happened and starting off analysis,</v>

127
00:06:53.181 --> 00:06:55.610
<v Speaker 1>which is quite striking,</v>

128
00:06:55.611 --> 00:06:56.091
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

129
00:06:56.091 --> 00:06:59.220
<v Speaker 1>is that the only thing that reliable reduces inequality.</v>

130
00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.370
<v Speaker 1>The only he got into fights or factors,</v>

131
00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:05.600
<v Speaker 1>but eating kind of boiled down to two more and the illness,</v>

132
00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:10.150
<v Speaker 1>so plagues and an outright warfare decrease inequality.</v>

133
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.280
<v Speaker 1>Why flapping everyone and there's no.</v>

134
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.500
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't detect any effect,</v>

135
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:16.730
<v Speaker 1>any real effective,</v>

136
00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:17.310
<v Speaker 1>viable,</v>

137
00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:18.980
<v Speaker 1>any viable political effect.</v>

138
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:24.400
<v Speaker 1>So that's quite striking and it's well known that system everywhere producing</v>

139
00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.080
<v Speaker 1>quality.</v>

140
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.140
<v Speaker 1>The thing that that I think makes the west remarkable or the free market,</v>

141
00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:33.620
<v Speaker 1>let's say remarkable is that a along with the producing inequality and also</v>

142
00:07:33.621 --> 00:07:38.470
<v Speaker 1>produces wealth because it's easy to set up the society that produces nothing</v>

143
00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:39.500
<v Speaker 1>but a new quality,</v>

144
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.460
<v Speaker 1>no wealth,</v>

145
00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:44.750
<v Speaker 1>and so maybe we should thank our lucky stars that although we still suffer from</v>

146
00:07:44.751 --> 00:07:46.220
<v Speaker 1>the consequences of the good quality,</v>

147
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:51.050
<v Speaker 1>we also live in a society with a system that old socio culture,</v>

148
00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:55.880
<v Speaker 1>let's say to also produce wealth and then we don't have to start and our</v>

149
00:07:55.881 --> 00:07:58.400
<v Speaker 1>children will have to start and increasingly around the world.</v>

150
00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.680
<v Speaker 1>People have to start with and that's the best.</v>

151
00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:04.220
<v Speaker 1>But I want to talk to you more about hierarchies because there's something</v>

152
00:08:04.221 --> 00:08:09.221
<v Speaker 1>really important apart from the fact that hierarchies can't be laid at the feet</v>

153
00:08:10.191 --> 00:08:11.600
<v Speaker 1>of political institution.</v>

154
00:08:11.601 --> 00:08:15.530
<v Speaker 1>Stand apart from the fact that there are no simple and easy political fix.</v>

155
00:08:15.531 --> 00:08:16.010
<v Speaker 1>This.</v>

156
00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:18.860
<v Speaker 1>There's something else that's really important to think about with regards to</v>

157
00:08:18.861 --> 00:08:19.341
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies.</v>

158
00:08:19.341 --> 00:08:19.941
<v Speaker 1>Because you might say,</v>

159
00:08:19.941 --> 00:08:20.150
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

160
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:21.920
<v Speaker 1>even if they are ubiquitous,</v>

161
00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:23.000
<v Speaker 1>even if they're everywhere,</v>

162
00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:26.840
<v Speaker 1>even if they're grounded in biology or already emergent properties of social</v>

163
00:08:26.841 --> 00:08:27.531
<v Speaker 1>interactions.</v>

164
00:08:27.531 --> 00:08:30.050
<v Speaker 1>Because either or both of those could be true,</v>

165
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:33.140
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't necessarily mean the tire or periods of good thing.</v>

166
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:37.130
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we should still just trying to bring up and down and I would say that's</v>

167
00:08:37.131 --> 00:08:38.570
<v Speaker 1>another trope of the left,</v>

168
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:41.090
<v Speaker 1>but I also think that that's an extraordinary bad idea.</v>

169
00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:43.850
<v Speaker 1>I think it's an impossible idea first of all,</v>

170
00:08:43.851 --> 00:08:44.610
<v Speaker 1>but north week,</v>

171
00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:45.770
<v Speaker 1>is it an impossible idea?</v>

172
00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:46.970
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a really,</v>

173
00:08:46.971 --> 00:08:47.990
<v Speaker 1>really bad idea.</v>

174
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:48.980
<v Speaker 1>Here's.</v>

175
00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:49.813
<v Speaker 1>Let me make sure.</v>

176
00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:50.560
<v Speaker 1>I think that.</v>

177
00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:51.890
<v Speaker 1>Can you see what you think about?</v>

178
00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.980
<v Speaker 1>So there's kind of two things that you want to</v>

179
00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:59.780
<v Speaker 1>speaking maybe more on me than anything else.</v>

180
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.860
<v Speaker 1>You want to limit your exposure to existential terror.</v>

181
00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:04.690
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

182
00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:07.500
<v Speaker 1>so you don't want to be too anxious and you have your resistance will be added</v>

183
00:09:07.501 --> 00:09:07.861
<v Speaker 1>to the center,</v>

184
00:09:07.861 --> 00:09:11.520
<v Speaker 1>but he hasn't listened to be anxious because of being so self conscious that our</v>

185
00:09:11.521 --> 00:09:15.720
<v Speaker 1>lives are or more when our lives are fragile and we have reason to be anxious</v>

186
00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:18.570
<v Speaker 1>and it's very difficult for us to keep our anxiety under control.</v>

187
00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:22.830
<v Speaker 1>So you don't want things to be too unstable because it destroys you</v>

188
00:09:22.831 --> 00:09:23.840
<v Speaker 1>psychophysiological.</v>

189
00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:25.700
<v Speaker 1>It's not just a psychological phenomenon,</v>

190
00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:28.910
<v Speaker 1>it destroys you physiologically as well as psychological help.</v>

191
00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.680
<v Speaker 1>Keep the complexity of those certainty under control,</v>

192
00:09:31.681 --> 00:09:36.090
<v Speaker 1>so that's like rule number one and rule number two is it's not so bad to have</v>

193
00:09:36.091 --> 00:09:38.420
<v Speaker 1>something to live for and that's.</v>

194
00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:40.420
<v Speaker 1>That's actually a positive emotion issue.</v>

195
00:09:40.421 --> 00:09:41.740
<v Speaker 1>So what the negative emotion.</v>

196
00:09:41.741 --> 00:09:45.030
<v Speaker 1>So you want me to get the motion control primary what?</v>

197
00:09:45.031 --> 00:09:45.811
<v Speaker 1>Painting for sure,</v>

198
00:09:45.811 --> 00:09:48.900
<v Speaker 1>but also anxiety and now the positive emotion side.</v>

199
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:54.290
<v Speaker 1>Well you want to be satisfied now and then they get what it is that you want and</v>

200
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:55.020
<v Speaker 1>need,</v>

201
00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:55.853
<v Speaker 1>but but.</v>

202
00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:58.110
<v Speaker 1>But that's a secondary consideration in some sense.</v>

203
00:09:58.111 --> 00:10:01.680
<v Speaker 1>Most of what you want is something to strive for,</v>

204
00:10:01.681 --> 00:10:03.220
<v Speaker 1>something to hope for somebody,</v>

205
00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.110
<v Speaker 1>a map,</v>

206
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:06.930
<v Speaker 1>something that makes getting out of bed in the morning worthwhile.</v>

207
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.310
<v Speaker 1>Let's call it a purpose.</v>

208
00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:09.450
<v Speaker 1>Something that's meaningful,</v>

209
00:10:09.451 --> 00:10:11.060
<v Speaker 1>something that you can engage with,</v>

210
00:10:11.061 --> 00:10:11.431
<v Speaker 1>you have.</v>

211
00:10:11.431 --> 00:10:15.540
<v Speaker 1>You don't even have a primary psychobiological system that is actually</v>

212
00:10:15.541 --> 00:10:17.040
<v Speaker 1>responsive to such space.</v>

213
00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.021
<v Speaker 1>It's this has been.</v>

214
00:10:18.021 --> 00:10:19.920
<v Speaker 1>It's activated by drugs like cocaine.</v>

215
00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.630
<v Speaker 1>It's a system that wrote to a dope beat.</v>

216
00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.020
<v Speaker 1>It had human being succeed,</v>

217
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:28.020
<v Speaker 1>particularly powerful because we seem to be more motivated to chase things that</v>

218
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.450
<v Speaker 1>we want than we are to actually get the.</v>

219
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:33.180
<v Speaker 1>Have you been kind of notice in your life because you don't.</v>

220
00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.890
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you've had a bowl for years.</v>

221
00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:35.281
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

222
00:10:35.281 --> 00:10:36.810
<v Speaker 1>graduation is a good example,</v>

223
00:10:36.811 --> 00:10:37.110
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

224
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:38.700
<v Speaker 1>You're in college here in high school.</v>

225
00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:41.460
<v Speaker 1>You're chasing this goal of graduation and then you graduate.</v>

226
00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:43.490
<v Speaker 1>Well then what?</v>

227
00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:44.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

228
00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:48.960
<v Speaker 1>then the game starts again the next day after you graduate your local band on</v>

229
00:10:48.961 --> 00:10:51.510
<v Speaker 1>the toilet bowl for the next big adventure,</v>

230
00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:55.830
<v Speaker 1>and so the fact that you attained your goal doesn't mean that you stop at any</v>

231
00:10:55.831 --> 00:10:56.161
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

232
00:10:56.161 --> 00:11:00.780
<v Speaker 1>What it means is that you need to do school and people need goals and so we can</v>

233
00:11:00.781 --> 00:11:01.410
<v Speaker 1>take a little bit of.</v>

234
00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:02.520
<v Speaker 1>You need more.</v>

235
00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:07.580
<v Speaker 1>We've absolutely you need it for way more than you think even and they can check</v>

236
00:11:08.521 --> 00:11:08.881
<v Speaker 1>your hand.</v>

237
00:11:08.881 --> 00:11:09.541
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

238
00:11:09.541 --> 00:11:12.280
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a chapter called be precise in your speech,</v>

239
00:11:12.281 --> 00:11:17.281
<v Speaker 1>in that chapter lays out the fact that this is a fact as far as I'm concerned,</v>

240
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:18.500
<v Speaker 1>that you can do that.</v>

241
00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:22.830
<v Speaker 1>Look at the world without a goal because your actual perceptions of the world</v>

242
00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:26.970
<v Speaker 1>are organized around your value structure and I don't even know if this</v>

243
00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:27.780
<v Speaker 1>electrical metal,</v>

244
00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:30.030
<v Speaker 1>the world's complicated to look at,</v>

245
00:11:30.031 --> 00:11:34.110
<v Speaker 1>which is why it's taken so long to produce machines that can see artificially.</v>

246
00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:37.480
<v Speaker 1>We thought we'd have that problem solved like 20 years ago or just getting there</v>

247
00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:38.190
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

248
00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:41.970
<v Speaker 1>You can't see the world with other cool and you can tell that because you point</v>

249
00:11:41.971 --> 00:11:45.330
<v Speaker 1>your eyes and things and you point your eyes to things that you're engaged with</v>

250
00:11:45.331 --> 00:11:46.110
<v Speaker 1>an interactive thing.</v>

251
00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:51.110
<v Speaker 1>So every single perceptual move you make is an act of valuing and so he can't</v>

252
00:11:51.721 --> 00:11:54.350
<v Speaker 1>even perceive the world without a okay,</v>

253
00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:58.420
<v Speaker 1>so equal to sustain you in life.</v>

254
00:11:58.421 --> 00:12:01.390
<v Speaker 1>And if people even to look at the world.</v>

255
00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:06.880
<v Speaker 1>So let's think about the consequences of having a goal.</v>

256
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:07.421
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

257
00:12:07.421 --> 00:12:09.700
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing is the thing.</v>

258
00:12:09.701 --> 00:12:11.830
<v Speaker 1>You're not actually be better than what you have,</v>

259
00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:12.581
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

260
00:12:12.581 --> 00:12:13.330
<v Speaker 1>Unless there's.</v>

261
00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:16.930
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're aiming down and that's not good,</v>

262
00:12:16.931 --> 00:12:17.591
<v Speaker 1>like people do it.</v>

263
00:12:17.591 --> 00:12:20.770
<v Speaker 1>The guy who just read over those people with the bat,</v>

264
00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:23.590
<v Speaker 1>he was aiming down like seriously?</v>

265
00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:27.760
<v Speaker 1>He was aiming to get out and so I would say aiming down as a bad sign.</v>

266
00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:29.590
<v Speaker 1>If you're aiming down,</v>

267
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:31.750
<v Speaker 1>you're in a bad way,</v>

268
00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:35.260
<v Speaker 1>you're on a path to promotion and maybe we'll take some people with you.</v>

269
00:12:35.261 --> 00:12:36.280
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good thing,</v>

270
00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:40.420
<v Speaker 1>so then you already know and you don't want to eat too high up because what the</v>

271
00:12:40.421 --> 00:12:41.254
<v Speaker 1>hell good are you,</v>

272
00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:42.103
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

273
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:42.660
<v Speaker 1>If it's.</v>

274
00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:44.080
<v Speaker 1>If your goal is to Boffi,</v>

275
00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:47.290
<v Speaker 1>then it's impossible it all you're going to do is frustrate yourself to death</v>

276
00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:48.460
<v Speaker 1>when we pursue it.</v>

277
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:49.870
<v Speaker 1>Not Thinking shouldn't be high,</v>

278
00:12:49.871 --> 00:12:50.704
<v Speaker 1>but you shouldn't.</v>

279
00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:54.280
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to punish yourself by constantly reaching for things that are</v>

280
00:12:54.281 --> 00:12:55.930
<v Speaker 1>continually beyond your grasp.</v>

281
00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.170
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't do that to a child if you cared for the child.</v>

282
00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.790
<v Speaker 1>We shouldn't do that to yourself.</v>

283
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:02.840
<v Speaker 1>I could say that you're a not.</v>

284
00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:03.251
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

285
00:13:03.251 --> 00:13:06.550
<v Speaker 1>so what that means is what you're aiming at is better than what you have.</v>

286
00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.380
<v Speaker 1>That's a value proposition,</v>

287
00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:08.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

288
00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:09.990
<v Speaker 1>There's value there.</v>

289
00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.433
<v Speaker 1>Here I am,</v>

290
00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:15.190
<v Speaker 1>but it's not where I want to stay awake to go to the next place.</v>

291
00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:16.480
<v Speaker 1>The next place is hypothetical.</v>

292
00:13:16.481 --> 00:13:17.080
<v Speaker 1>You better.</v>

293
00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:20.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sort of the basis of the idea of mythological quest,</v>

294
00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:23.830
<v Speaker 1>which is why the quest story is everywhere,</v>

295
00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:24.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

296
00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:29.340
<v Speaker 1>You've probably seen most of the pharmacy 20 movies in the last five years that</v>

297
00:13:29.591 --> 00:13:32.650
<v Speaker 1>our quest stories and it's because no one krasner.</v>

298
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:33.880
<v Speaker 1>You're after something,</v>

299
00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:34.540
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

300
00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:37.090
<v Speaker 1>You go after whatever it is that you're after.</v>

301
00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:41.110
<v Speaker 1>You collapse a bit the way and you fail and you fall apart and you put yourself</v>

302
00:13:41.111 --> 00:13:41.670
<v Speaker 1>back together.</v>

303
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:42.670
<v Speaker 1>You have your adventure,</v>

304
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:46.220
<v Speaker 1>you told your story and that's life and you have to have a question.</v>

305
00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:50.830
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully you have a quest that sub sufficient brand here so that it justifies</v>

306
00:13:50.831 --> 00:13:55.090
<v Speaker 1>your life because that's really what you want is you want to have a name that's</v>

307
00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:56.320
<v Speaker 1>profound enough,</v>

308
00:13:56.380 --> 00:14:01.380
<v Speaker 1>so the fact that you're finding and suffering is justifiable.</v>

309
00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:05.260
<v Speaker 1>You could get out of Gordon and think,</v>

310
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:05.741
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

311
00:14:05.741 --> 00:14:06.040
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

312
00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:06.873
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

313
00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:11.140
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of things about life than a rough and harsh,</v>

314
00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:16.710
<v Speaker 1>but I'm doing something that justifies and then then you've got that.</v>

315
00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:18.310
<v Speaker 1>You've got a meeting.</v>

316
00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:22.060
<v Speaker 1>You've got a purpose of thank God for that because otherwise it's bitterness and</v>

317
00:14:22.061 --> 00:14:25.440
<v Speaker 1>hail all the way down and so it's a good thing.</v>

318
00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:28.360
<v Speaker 1>Have so now you pause your value.</v>

319
00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:32.230
<v Speaker 1>You're ending up so now you've agreed that there is an app because otherwise,</v>

320
00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:36.640
<v Speaker 1>why would you put in an effort to attain your goal if you did it implicitly</v>

321
00:14:36.641 --> 00:14:40.120
<v Speaker 1>accept the fact that the you're aiming at is better than the that you have,</v>

322
00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:45.040
<v Speaker 1>so now you're also accepting a value Schema of good and bad and being the</v>

323
00:14:45.041 --> 00:14:48.680
<v Speaker 1>ultimate acceptance of the value Schema of good and bad isn't even good,</v>

324
00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:49.060
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>

325
00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:50.500
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's good and evil.</v>

326
00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:51.900
<v Speaker 1>If you talks about breakthrough,</v>

327
00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:55.790
<v Speaker 1>it's archetipal poles and you live in a landscape of good and evil.</v>

328
00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:58.250
<v Speaker 1>That's the landscape of the quest.</v>

329
00:14:58.850 --> 00:14:59.683
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

330
00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.660
<v Speaker 1>here's the problem with regards to hierarchy,</v>

331
00:15:02.661 --> 00:15:07.040
<v Speaker 1>so let's let's say that you assume that some things are worth pursuing and are</v>

332
00:15:07.041 --> 00:15:08.900
<v Speaker 1>you going to do that in a social space,</v>

333
00:15:08.901 --> 00:15:09.111
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

334
00:15:09.111 --> 00:15:09.760
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>

335
00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:09.900
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

336
00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:10.521
<v Speaker 1>hardly any.</v>

337
00:15:10.521 --> 00:15:12.980
<v Speaker 1>If you were ever going to do anything entirely alone,</v>

338
00:15:12.981 --> 00:15:13.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean now and then,</v>

339
00:15:13.821 --> 00:15:17.510
<v Speaker 1>but we're social right to the court were cooperating and competing with other</v>

340
00:15:17.511 --> 00:15:18.620
<v Speaker 1>people all the time,</v>

341
00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:22.340
<v Speaker 1>so you lay out your quest in a collective landscape.</v>

342
00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:26.330
<v Speaker 1>That means that as you're moving from point a to point b,</v>

343
00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.810
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to be cooperating and competing with other people.</v>

344
00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:34.980
<v Speaker 1>You will be instantly produce around your goal on organization of other people</v>

345
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:38.960
<v Speaker 1>and some of her peripherally involved in and so forth,</v>

346
00:15:38.961 --> 00:15:42.320
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter because the rop is this.</v>

347
00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:44.730
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you punch that something is worthwhile,</v>

348
00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:49.220
<v Speaker 1>you produce a hierarchy because as people cooperate and compete towards that</v>

349
00:15:49.221 --> 00:15:49.880
<v Speaker 1>end,</v>

350
00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:51.560
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter what the end is.</v>

351
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:56.380
<v Speaker 1>Some people are going to end up being way better at it than other people and</v>

352
00:15:56.390 --> 00:16:00.650
<v Speaker 1>some people are going to be heard data and so what will happen is that around</v>

353
00:16:00.651 --> 00:16:01.910
<v Speaker 1>your value hierarchy,</v>

354
00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:05.840
<v Speaker 1>you'll stack up pure middle hierarchical structure that is composed of the</v>

355
00:16:05.841 --> 00:16:10.070
<v Speaker 1>people who develop expertise in relationship to that goal and people who don't.</v>

356
00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:12.380
<v Speaker 1>Now hopefully for the people who don't,</v>

357
00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.420
<v Speaker 1>there are other games.</v>

358
00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:17.030
<v Speaker 1>There are other value propositions that they can play,</v>

359
00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:17.391
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

360
00:16:17.391 --> 00:16:20.000
<v Speaker 1>because that's what you want from a pluralistic society.</v>

361
00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:24.860
<v Speaker 1>If your options are limited because you're not good at one game and hopefully</v>

362
00:16:24.861 --> 00:16:27.050
<v Speaker 1>there's no desk games live around that,</v>

363
00:16:27.051 --> 00:16:28.700
<v Speaker 1>you can go participate in that.</v>

364
00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:33.720
<v Speaker 1>I think that's one of the real geniuses of modern society is that with any luck,</v>

365
00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:34.880
<v Speaker 1>there's.</v>

366
00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:38.050
<v Speaker 1>There's a critical place for almost everyone and there.</v>

367
00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:41.300
<v Speaker 1>Sure thing because if you can't find the credible place,</v>

368
00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.640
<v Speaker 1>well maybe that reflects badly on you,</v>

369
00:16:43.641 --> 00:16:46.640
<v Speaker 1>but it's also possible that reflects badly on the society.</v>

370
00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:49.340
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good thing because people need a critical place,</v>

371
00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:54.080
<v Speaker 1>but the point is that construction of a hierarchy is inevitable.</v>

372
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:57.650
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to accept the proposition that some things are more valuable</v>

373
00:16:57.651 --> 00:16:58.484
<v Speaker 1>than others,</v>

374
00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:01.790
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't accept the proposition that some things are more valuable than</v>

375
00:17:01.791 --> 00:17:02.250
<v Speaker 1>others,</v>

376
00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:05.210
<v Speaker 1>that is the reason to do anything and you might think,</v>

377
00:17:05.211 --> 00:17:05.451
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

378
00:17:05.451 --> 00:17:05.930
<v Speaker 1>who cares?</v>

379
00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:07.550
<v Speaker 1>If there's no reason to do anything,</v>

380
00:17:07.830 --> 00:17:11.300
<v Speaker 1>you know why you need a reason and the answer to that as far as I can tell us,</v>

381
00:17:11.301 --> 00:17:12.380
<v Speaker 1>because your life is very,</v>

382
00:17:12.381 --> 00:17:13.220
<v Speaker 1>very difficult.</v>

383
00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:17.330
<v Speaker 1>Like life is characterized intrinsically by ineradicable.</v>

384
00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:22.360
<v Speaker 1>Elbert are limited limitation and suffering and there's no escape from that.</v>

385
00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.530
<v Speaker 1>There's little rationalization of that.</v>

386
00:17:24.531 --> 00:17:25.364
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>

387
00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:28.100
<v Speaker 1>there's no denying that everyone knows that can sometimes,</v>

388
00:17:28.101 --> 00:17:28.311
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

389
00:17:28.311 --> 00:17:33.260
<v Speaker 1>it's so painful you can bury them because you know as social needs something to</v>

390
00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:38.180
<v Speaker 1>make that worthwhile and if you're going to play the game of making it</v>

391
00:17:38.181 --> 00:17:38.631
<v Speaker 1>worthwhile,</v>

392
00:17:38.631 --> 00:17:40.730
<v Speaker 1>they have to accept the value proposition.</v>

393
00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:43.310
<v Speaker 1>And then what comes along with that is the hierarchy.</v>

394
00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:45.380
<v Speaker 1>So why are you going to do.</v>

395
00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:47.340
<v Speaker 1>You're going to blow up the value hierarchy.</v>

396
00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:48.710
<v Speaker 1>So the value proposition.</v>

397
00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:53.250
<v Speaker 1>So there's no hierarchy or what do you leave people with that you really like to</v>

398
00:17:53.251 --> 00:17:54.900
<v Speaker 1>know a then no goal,</v>

399
00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:55.770
<v Speaker 1>no purpose,</v>

400
00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:56.603
<v Speaker 1>no meaning.</v>

401
00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:56.980
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

402
00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:58.350
<v Speaker 1>that's your cure map.</v>

403
00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:00.210
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to see what the disease is.</v>

404
00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:01.620
<v Speaker 1>It's not good.</v>

405
00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.920
<v Speaker 1>So now we'll put that aside.</v>

406
00:18:04.921 --> 00:18:05.754
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

407
00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:09.061
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>

408
00:18:09.061 --> 00:18:10.050
<v Speaker 1>well that's the hierarchy.</v>

409
00:18:10.051 --> 00:18:13.770
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't a terrible aspect of a hierarchy justified the value proposition?</v>

410
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:14.101
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

411
00:18:14.101 --> 00:18:15.150
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>

412
00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:16.300
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

413
00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:18.080
<v Speaker 1>I think we know what answered that too.</v>

414
00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:18.860
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

415
00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:19.693
<v Speaker 1>let's say you,</v>

416
00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.090
<v Speaker 1>you lay out the goal.</v>

417
00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:21.571
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>

418
00:18:21.571 --> 00:18:21.721
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

419
00:18:21.721 --> 00:18:23.070
<v Speaker 1>what's a good goal?</v>

420
00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:27.480
<v Speaker 1>And that's a good inquiry to the idea of what constitutes good,</v>

421
00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:32.190
<v Speaker 1>but I think we're sophisticated enough to have somewhat of a technical answer to</v>

422
00:18:32.191 --> 00:18:35.240
<v Speaker 1>that and you can even see this emerging unanimous cc.</v>

423
00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:37.150
<v Speaker 1>So this morality that I'm laying out,</v>

424
00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:38.720
<v Speaker 1>it's trends human.</v>

425
00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:39.050
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

426
00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:39.330
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

427
00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:39.900
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

428
00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:41.390
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of like the hierarchy issue.</v>

429
00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:43.170
<v Speaker 1>You know when you see hierarchies of human beings,</v>

430
00:18:43.171 --> 00:18:44.490
<v Speaker 1>but you also see them in animals.</v>

431
00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:47.040
<v Speaker 1>You see this immersion morality and human beings,</v>

432
00:18:47.041 --> 00:18:48.300
<v Speaker 1>but you also see it an Admin,</v>

433
00:18:48.301 --> 00:18:51.360
<v Speaker 1>so it's deeper and broader than human might say,</v>

434
00:18:51.361 --> 00:18:52.170
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

435
00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:54.450
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to pursue something that's good.</v>

436
00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.690
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to parameterize?</v>

437
00:18:57.691 --> 00:18:59.610
<v Speaker 1>What's good so that you know it's good.</v>

438
00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:00.653
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

439
00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:00.971
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

440
00:19:00.971 --> 00:19:04.740
<v Speaker 1>here's what the developmental psychologists job piaget came up with after</v>

441
00:19:04.741 --> 00:19:05.820
<v Speaker 1>thinking about this for many,</v>

442
00:19:05.821 --> 00:19:08.290
<v Speaker 1>many years of studying children at Piaget,</v>

443
00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:12.990
<v Speaker 1>the who was the most outstanding child psychologist or the 20th century was</v>

444
00:19:12.991 --> 00:19:16.170
<v Speaker 1>motivated to do what he did because he was turning to reconcile science and</v>

445
00:19:16.171 --> 00:19:16.980
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>

446
00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:18.390
<v Speaker 1>It's not something that people know about.</v>

447
00:19:18.391 --> 00:19:18.811
<v Speaker 1>Piaget,</v>

448
00:19:18.811 --> 00:19:19.644
<v Speaker 1>much ship isn't,</v>

449
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:23.970
<v Speaker 1>isn't really advertised in university courses dealing with fusion because it's</v>

450
00:19:23.971 --> 00:19:25.260
<v Speaker 1>such a strange issue,</v>

451
00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:29.520
<v Speaker 1>but he's a genius and he got offered to curatorship of a museum because of a</v>

452
00:19:29.521 --> 00:19:30.740
<v Speaker 1>paper we wrote on the Bolus.</v>

453
00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:34.470
<v Speaker 1>Swimming was 10 years old and his parents had been rejected.</v>

454
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:36.420
<v Speaker 1>They wrote back the people who asked them and said,</v>

455
00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:36.920
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

456
00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:37.201
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

457
00:19:37.201 --> 00:19:39.630
<v Speaker 1>that's all very well and but he's had</v>

458
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:46.390
<v Speaker 1>anger is a financial genius and he had this very interesting idea and so it's an</v>

459
00:19:46.511 --> 00:19:50.820
<v Speaker 1>elaboration on scientific elaboration of the,</v>

460
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:53.620
<v Speaker 1>the last for Daniel proposition.</v>

461
00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:58.640
<v Speaker 1>So concert ethical proposition was something like if you're going to act and</v>

462
00:19:59.821 --> 00:20:02.160
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to figure out whether what you're doing is good,</v>

463
00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:06.900
<v Speaker 1>you should imagine that everyone will do it and see if that would be a good</v>

464
00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:07.763
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

465
00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.040
<v Speaker 1>And so if it's universalized bubble,</v>

466
00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:12.000
<v Speaker 1>then perhaps it's ethical.</v>

467
00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:16.260
<v Speaker 1>So that's counts categorical imperative and it's an interesting way to think</v>

468
00:20:16.261 --> 00:20:16.980
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

469
00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:21.980
<v Speaker 1>I think there's some utility in Psj are the differentiated that quite nicely and</v>

470
00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:23.731
<v Speaker 1>tall.</v>

471
00:20:23.731 --> 00:20:24.810
<v Speaker 1>Articulate that a little bit.</v>

472
00:20:24.811 --> 00:20:26.340
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing is,</v>

473
00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:30.810
<v Speaker 1>so imagine you've got an aid now and you're pursuing it.</v>

474
00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:34.080
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to fix yourself.</v>

475
00:20:34.081 --> 00:20:36.000
<v Speaker 1>May Room yourself tomorrow.</v>

476
00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.370
<v Speaker 1>That'd be an impulsive and you know what that's like.</v>

477
00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:40.620
<v Speaker 1>That's like two bottles of wine at dinner.</v>

478
00:20:40.621 --> 00:20:41.140
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

479
00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:42.620
<v Speaker 1>that's great during Ganda,</v>

480
00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:45.550
<v Speaker 1>but it's not so good for you tomorrow anyway.</v>

481
00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.620
<v Speaker 1>I think the hell with it,</v>

482
00:20:46.621 --> 00:20:51.621
<v Speaker 1>it's worth tomorrow is that if you're going to put forward the goal you want to</v>

483
00:20:53.381 --> 00:20:53.921
<v Speaker 1>put forward,</v>

484
00:20:53.921 --> 00:20:55.990
<v Speaker 1>the goal that stood for you right now,</v>

485
00:20:55.991 --> 00:21:00.280
<v Speaker 1>but it's also good for moral but not just tomorrow because you're not just</v>

486
00:21:00.281 --> 00:21:01.114
<v Speaker 1>around tomorrow,</v>

487
00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.340
<v Speaker 1>next week,</v>

488
00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:02.990
<v Speaker 1>next month,</v>

489
00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:03.823
<v Speaker 1>next year,</v>

490
00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:08.940
<v Speaker 1>five years from now and so whatever it is the uranian for should be sue you now,</v>

491
00:21:09.851 --> 00:21:14.320
<v Speaker 1>but it should suit the array of future use that are likely to manifest</v>

492
00:21:14.321 --> 00:21:15.670
<v Speaker 1>themselves across time.</v>

493
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:18.800
<v Speaker 1>And so now the reason I'm telling you this,</v>

494
00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:20.320
<v Speaker 1>this is really important.</v>

495
00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:24.640
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to take a bit of a side detour and then come back.</v>

496
00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:29.700
<v Speaker 1>So the fundamental postpartum playing this something like there's a near</v>

497
00:21:30.521 --> 00:21:34.390
<v Speaker 1>infinite number of points to interpret the world and so it's very difficult to.</v>

498
00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:37.480
<v Speaker 1>Because of the number of wasted to interpret the world,</v>

499
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:39.040
<v Speaker 1>which happens to be true by the way,</v>

500
00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:39.970
<v Speaker 1>even technically,</v>

501
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.100
<v Speaker 1>which is why it's so difficult to build machines,</v>

502
00:21:42.101 --> 00:21:44.890
<v Speaker 1>to see the world because it's very hard to see the world.</v>

503
00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:50.070
<v Speaker 1>The fact that there's a number of ways to the world does not mean that there are</v>

504
00:21:51.101 --> 00:21:56.101
<v Speaker 1>a near infinite number of viable ways of looking at the world and that's.</v>

505
00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:59.200
<v Speaker 1>That's a crucial distinction because it could give.</v>

506
00:21:59.201 --> 00:22:01.150
<v Speaker 1>The postmodernist sister said,</v>

507
00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:01.421
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

508
00:22:01.421 --> 00:22:04.930
<v Speaker 1>he stumbled on the problem or multiple interpretations,</v>

509
00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:06.070
<v Speaker 1>but they left it there.</v>

510
00:22:06.071 --> 00:22:06.341
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

511
00:22:06.341 --> 00:22:06.940
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

512
00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:07.650
<v Speaker 1>that is the problem.</v>

513
00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:08.680
<v Speaker 1>Life is complicated.</v>

514
00:22:08.681 --> 00:22:10.470
<v Speaker 1>How the hell do you compute your way through?</v>

515
00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:11.201
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>

516
00:22:11.201 --> 00:22:12.220
<v Speaker 1>really difficult,</v>

517
00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:15.660
<v Speaker 1>but for lots of things that don't work like communism,</v>

518
00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:19.670
<v Speaker 1>communism off the track,</v>

519
00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:25.150
<v Speaker 1>thank [inaudible].</v>

520
00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:32.030
<v Speaker 1>There's only two excuses for still clinging to the idea of autonomy is works.</v>

521
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:37.070
<v Speaker 1>One is that you are historically ignorant beyond all possible ethical.</v>

522
00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:39.843
<v Speaker 1>What would you say?</v>

523
00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:41.470
<v Speaker 1>Ethical reason,</v>

524
00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:43.840
<v Speaker 1>or you're or you're willfully blind.</v>

525
00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:46.390
<v Speaker 1>Three reasons or if real from the glide or here,</v>

526
00:22:46.391 --> 00:22:49.780
<v Speaker 1>so God damn Arabic that you think if you wouldn't be standing that you invested</v>

527
00:22:49.781 --> 00:22:52.570
<v Speaker 1>in me and told me on the last point is very,</v>

528
00:22:52.571 --> 00:22:53.080
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

529
00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:54.940
<v Speaker 1>very much more common than people think.</v>

530
00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:55.331
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

531
00:22:55.331 --> 00:22:55.481
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

532
00:22:55.481 --> 00:22:57.910
<v Speaker 1>if I reverse the charge of implementing communism,</v>

533
00:22:57.970 --> 00:22:59.050
<v Speaker 1>it would have all gone well.</v>

534
00:22:59.051 --> 00:22:59.470
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

535
00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:01.600
<v Speaker 1>no and absolutely what?</v>

536
00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.360
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you're the sort of person who actually thinks that.</v>

537
00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:11.260
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

538
00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:14.390
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

539
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:15.980
<v Speaker 1>so from active liability,</v>

540
00:23:15.981 --> 00:23:18.540
<v Speaker 1>so here's the constraints and NDC.</v>

541
00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:19.570
<v Speaker 1>I think I could.</v>

542
00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:23.560
<v Speaker 1>The thing I was so striking to me about reading piaget and also a member of the</v>

543
00:23:23.561 --> 00:23:27.490
<v Speaker 1>ankle experimentalists that I read who are also interested in how morality built</v>

544
00:23:27.491 --> 00:23:30.210
<v Speaker 1>itself from people like friends who all.</v>

545
00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:35.190
<v Speaker 1>He studied chimpanzee behavior and he felt just who studied both back behavior</v>

546
00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:39.670
<v Speaker 1>and then complex social interactions between animals and General Jaak Panksepp</v>

547
00:23:39.671 --> 00:23:43.450
<v Speaker 1>who study the development of a complex platforms in racks,</v>

548
00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:44.970
<v Speaker 1>all pointed the same thing.</v>

549
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.480
<v Speaker 1>There's a morality,</v>

550
00:23:46.481 --> 00:23:48.640
<v Speaker 1>but he merges off from the bottom up,</v>

551
00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:49.730
<v Speaker 1>not from the top down.</v>

552
00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:50.510
<v Speaker 1>Not Rational.</v>

553
00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:54.830
<v Speaker 1>It's actually something that evolves and it characterizes all sorts of different</v>

554
00:23:54.831 --> 00:23:56.500
<v Speaker 1>species and players.</v>

555
00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:57.081
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

556
00:23:57.081 --> 00:23:57.914
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

557
00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:58.461
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

558
00:23:58.461 --> 00:24:00.320
<v Speaker 1>so here's what's the set of constraints,</v>

559
00:24:00.321 --> 00:24:00.561
<v Speaker 1>okay?</v>

560
00:24:00.561 --> 00:24:03.200
<v Speaker 1>Your first is this first constraint is constraints.</v>

561
00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:05.450
<v Speaker 1>You can't pursue what feels good.</v>

562
00:24:05.451 --> 00:24:05.990
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

563
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:07.280
<v Speaker 1>if it doesn't work leader,</v>

564
00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:09.530
<v Speaker 1>and that's really complicated,</v>

565
00:24:09.531 --> 00:24:09.711
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

566
00:24:09.711 --> 00:24:11.750
<v Speaker 1>Because it introduces behind into the equation.</v>

567
00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:13.130
<v Speaker 1>There's not just you,</v>

568
00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:17.150
<v Speaker 1>there's the array of future use that you have to take into account when you make</v>

569
00:24:17.151 --> 00:24:22.010
<v Speaker 1>your decisions and that's there's a multiplicity of the future use and you don't</v>

570
00:24:22.011 --> 00:24:25.400
<v Speaker 1>want to reduce that to two to a greater degree,</v>

571
00:24:25.401 --> 00:24:25.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

572
00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:28.670
<v Speaker 1>Because you don't want to set yourself up so you don't have any options.</v>

573
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.000
<v Speaker 1>So you can't gratify her impulses impulsively because if you do that,</v>

574
00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:38.690
<v Speaker 1>then what you do is you sacrifice your future self and if you want to be around</v>

575
00:24:38.691 --> 00:24:38.900
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

576
00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:39.980
<v Speaker 1>that's a bad idea.</v>

577
00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:44.150
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a major constraint because it has to work now to all next week,</v>

578
00:24:44.151 --> 00:24:44.720
<v Speaker 1>next month,</v>

579
00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:45.231
<v Speaker 1>next year,</v>

580
00:24:45.231 --> 00:24:47.150
<v Speaker 1>five years from now and so forth.</v>

581
00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:48.080
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

582
00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.110
<v Speaker 1>and you know that perfectly well in this part of taking care of yourself.</v>

583
00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:53.270
<v Speaker 1>So everyone has the sense of that,</v>

584
00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.390
<v Speaker 1>whether it's articulated,</v>

585
00:24:54.391 --> 00:24:55.210
<v Speaker 1>they're not.</v>

586
00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:58.340
<v Speaker 1>I think your instinctual sense of conscience,</v>

587
00:24:58.370 --> 00:25:02.180
<v Speaker 1>you know that that sense that you have with what's right and what's wrong is</v>

588
00:25:02.181 --> 00:25:06.530
<v Speaker 1>actually part of the evolve moral structure that guides you in a manner that</v>

589
00:25:06.531 --> 00:25:10.040
<v Speaker 1>helps you take care of your potential future self because otherwise you just</v>

590
00:25:10.041 --> 00:25:11.690
<v Speaker 1>died stupidly.</v>

591
00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:13.730
<v Speaker 1>You know at the more impulsive you are,</v>

592
00:25:13.731 --> 00:25:17.300
<v Speaker 1>the more likely to die stupidly and that you're getting.</v>

593
00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:18.230
<v Speaker 1>That's the end of that.</v>

594
00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:19.550
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

595
00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:20.320
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't,</v>

596
00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.010
<v Speaker 1>that isn't the only constraint.</v>

597
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:26.330
<v Speaker 1>Even though that's a serious distress in his note will be constrained because</v>

598
00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:30.220
<v Speaker 1>you also have to deal with other people and some of those people that are in</v>

599
00:25:30.221 --> 00:25:31.820
<v Speaker 1>immediate proximity to you.</v>

600
00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:32.620
<v Speaker 1>Let's say your,</v>

601
00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:32.830
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

602
00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:33.950
<v Speaker 1>your immediate family.</v>

603
00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:39.590
<v Speaker 1>You have to act in a way that works for them because otherwise they hate you and</v>

604
00:25:39.591 --> 00:25:44.360
<v Speaker 1>they torture you and they lead you or things get better and horrible around you.</v>

605
00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:45.770
<v Speaker 1>And so unless that's what you want,</v>

606
00:25:45.771 --> 00:25:47.450
<v Speaker 1>that seems like a bad idea.</v>

607
00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:50.420
<v Speaker 1>And so we have to foster their development and the president and you have to</v>

608
00:25:50.421 --> 00:25:52.070
<v Speaker 1>foster their future development.</v>

609
00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:55.760
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to do that with your family in a way that benefits</v>

610
00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:58.640
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically benefits to the community,</v>

611
00:25:58.760 --> 00:25:59.810
<v Speaker 1>the local community,</v>

612
00:25:59.811 --> 00:26:00.950
<v Speaker 1>and the broader community.</v>

613
00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:02.910
<v Speaker 1>And then again across almost talking pretty.</v>

614
00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:07.670
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like there's an infinite number of solutions to that set of problems</v>

615
00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:08.451
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

616
00:26:08.451 --> 00:26:08.880
<v Speaker 1>I think they,</v>

617
00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:12.450
<v Speaker 1>what we actually recognize as ethical behavior and which,</v>

618
00:26:12.451 --> 00:26:15.990
<v Speaker 1>which I think we do naturally recognize ethical behavior,</v>

619
00:26:15.991 --> 00:26:19.220
<v Speaker 1>is that behavior that's in alignment with that set of constraints.</v>

620
00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.920
<v Speaker 1>And it's not something that people discovered rationally.</v>

621
00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.680
<v Speaker 1>It's not a rational imposition invention.</v>

622
00:26:24.681 --> 00:26:26.810
<v Speaker 1>It's not a consequence of enlightenment.</v>

623
00:26:26.811 --> 00:26:27.411
<v Speaker 1>Morality,</v>

624
00:26:27.411 --> 00:26:28.244
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

625
00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:30.470
<v Speaker 1>technically speaking of the enlightenment,</v>

626
00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:31.850
<v Speaker 1>because lots of people,</v>

627
00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:32.793
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

628
00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:34.780
<v Speaker 1>who are enlightenment rationalist,</v>

629
00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:38.330
<v Speaker 1>believe that these propositions were set forth in an articulate manner,</v>

630
00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:39.370
<v Speaker 1>rationally be lightened.</v>

631
00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:41.030
<v Speaker 1>But to me they go.</v>

632
00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:45.680
<v Speaker 1>That was the gloss on top of something that was far deeper Panksepp.</v>

633
00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:46.231
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

634
00:26:46.231 --> 00:26:48.270
<v Speaker 1>some of you probably heard me talking about this before,</v>

635
00:26:48.271 --> 00:26:52.170
<v Speaker 1>but panksepp demonstrated that if you pair ras repeatedly,</v>

636
00:26:52.171 --> 00:26:55.920
<v Speaker 1>juvenile rats who loved to engage in rough and tumble play by the way,</v>

637
00:26:55.921 --> 00:26:58.440
<v Speaker 1>which is extremely good for developing rats.</v>

638
00:26:58.500 --> 00:26:59.870
<v Speaker 1>If you want to develop some wraps,</v>

639
00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:00.713
<v Speaker 1>that's how you do it,</v>

640
00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:05.160
<v Speaker 1>but it's also really good for developing little kids because they really like</v>

641
00:27:05.161 --> 00:27:07.920
<v Speaker 1>rough and tumble play and there's lots of complex reasons for that.</v>

642
00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:12.360
<v Speaker 1>What panksepp observed was that if you paired wrap dyads repeatedly,</v>

643
00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:16.260
<v Speaker 1>so not just one game and who played one game with someone,</v>

644
00:27:16.261 --> 00:27:16.471
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

645
00:27:16.471 --> 00:27:18.930
<v Speaker 1>You played a game and then you play the game again and again.</v>

646
00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:20.890
<v Speaker 1>That's what being married is in play.</v>

647
00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:24.840
<v Speaker 1>An infinite series of repeated Bill Gates.</v>

648
00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:28.170
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't play the property then it goes downhill very rapidly.</v>

649
00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:32.760
<v Speaker 1>So what Panksepp observed was that if you put it on Dale big,</v>

650
00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:33.890
<v Speaker 1>rapidly wrapped together,</v>

651
00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:37.200
<v Speaker 1>the pig gradlew stop a little rap in their first contest,</v>

652
00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:38.820
<v Speaker 1>but then if you parented repeatedly,</v>

653
00:27:38.821 --> 00:27:42.180
<v Speaker 1>unless the big route that deliberate when 30 percent of the time a little robin</v>

654
00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:46.860
<v Speaker 1>stop playing and so and it was up to the little rabbit to invite the play.</v>

655
00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:48.800
<v Speaker 1>So even among Ras,</v>

656
00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:50.610
<v Speaker 1>there's an immersive sense of fair play.</v>

657
00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.940
<v Speaker 1>Like literally there is divergence,</v>

658
00:27:52.941 --> 00:27:54.150
<v Speaker 1>sense of fair play.</v>

659
00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:57.510
<v Speaker 1>That's a consequence of having to repeat the game over and over.</v>

660
00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:01.110
<v Speaker 1>That's what so amazing discovery back.</v>

661
00:28:01.111 --> 00:28:01.561
<v Speaker 1>I read that.</v>

662
00:28:01.561 --> 00:28:02.010
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>

663
00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:03.060
<v Speaker 1>it just blows me away.</v>

664
00:28:03.061 --> 00:28:03.894
<v Speaker 1>I think it seeds.</v>

665
00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:04.670
<v Speaker 1>It's so funny.</v>

666
00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:05.700
<v Speaker 1>You never know where we'll bolt,</v>

667
00:28:05.701 --> 00:28:06.990
<v Speaker 1>which is going to come from because like,</v>

668
00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.330
<v Speaker 1>what's peg doing?</v>

669
00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:10.410
<v Speaker 1>He used to tickle rats with an eraser.</v>

670
00:28:10.810 --> 00:28:11.170
<v Speaker 1>There's no.</v>

671
00:28:11.170 --> 00:28:12.300
<v Speaker 1>What the hell is he doing?</v>

672
00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:14.251
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

673
00:28:14.251 --> 00:28:17.010
<v Speaker 1>it turns out that if you take rat pumps away from their mother,</v>

674
00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:21.750
<v Speaker 1>they got just like human infants to even if you feed them and give them enough</v>

675
00:28:21.751 --> 00:28:23.550
<v Speaker 1>liquid and keep them warm and everything,</v>

676
00:28:23.551 --> 00:28:25.080
<v Speaker 1>if they're not cared for,</v>

677
00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:26.290
<v Speaker 1>if they're not attached,</v>

678
00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.890
<v Speaker 1>their gastrointestinal system shut down in a dark,</v>

679
00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:29.970
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same thing,</v>

680
00:28:29.971 --> 00:28:31.230
<v Speaker 1>not to human babies.</v>

681
00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:34.200
<v Speaker 1>So touch touch is a primary need.</v>

682
00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:39.290
<v Speaker 1>So panksepp and people learn to massage little rats with the racist pencil races</v>

683
00:28:40.021 --> 00:28:43.230
<v Speaker 1>because they were gentle enough for the ranch would giggle ultrasonically</v>

684
00:28:43.231 --> 00:28:44.430
<v Speaker 1>because he recorded their,</v>

685
00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:44.890
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

686
00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:46.020
<v Speaker 1>their vocalizations,</v>

687
00:28:46.021 --> 00:28:47.610
<v Speaker 1>and they gave a little too sonically.</v>

688
00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:48.501
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't tell them,</v>

689
00:28:48.501 --> 00:28:49.260
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

690
00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:51.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to help you ever figured it out,</v>

691
00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:53.550
<v Speaker 1>but if you record them and then slow down the tape,</v>

692
00:28:53.551 --> 00:28:54.384
<v Speaker 1>you can hear them.</v>

693
00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:57.060
<v Speaker 1>And so that would entice them into life.</v>

694
00:28:57.540 --> 00:28:57.751
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

695
00:28:57.751 --> 00:28:58.411
<v Speaker 1>but the point is,</v>

696
00:28:58.411 --> 00:29:00.130
<v Speaker 1>is that even among rats,</v>

697
00:29:00.131 --> 00:29:02.010
<v Speaker 1>which are very social animals by the way,</v>

698
00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:02.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

699
00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:06.900
<v Speaker 1>there are serious constraints on interpersonal behavior that had ethical,</v>

700
00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:08.400
<v Speaker 1>essentially ethical nature.</v>

701
00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:12.020
<v Speaker 1>And so that's so cool because one of the things that's really hard on her</v>

702
00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:15.570
<v Speaker 1>culture is this emerging sense of moral relativism.</v>

703
00:29:15.571 --> 00:29:19.200
<v Speaker 1>That's it's a consequence of an excess of rational thinking,</v>

704
00:29:19.201 --> 00:29:24.201
<v Speaker 1>I think because rational thinker can optimize any step of propositions and if</v>

705
00:29:24.611 --> 00:29:25.680
<v Speaker 1>there's utility in that,</v>

706
00:29:25.681 --> 00:29:29.030
<v Speaker 1>because it's part of thinking to be critical and to be able to destroy things</v>

707
00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:29.873
<v Speaker 1>and rebuild them,</v>

708
00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:31.650
<v Speaker 1>but you don't want to destroy everything.</v>

709
00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:34.560
<v Speaker 1>And one of the issues that's immersed in the 20th century,</v>

710
00:29:34.561 --> 00:29:35.150
<v Speaker 1>the drugs,</v>

711
00:29:35.150 --> 00:29:38.070
<v Speaker 1>both nihilism and totalitarianism as far as I'm concerned,</v>

712
00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:42.340
<v Speaker 1>is the proposition that all value propositions are something arbitrary and</v>

713
00:29:42.341 --> 00:29:43.720
<v Speaker 1>equally print a sizable.</v>

714
00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:45.070
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think that there's any.</v>

715
00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:48.590
<v Speaker 1>I think we have enough evidence down from categorically state the best.</v>

716
00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:49.750
<v Speaker 1>That's just not true.</v>

717
00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:54.340
<v Speaker 1>That whatever ethics constitutes isn't arbitrary even though it's complex and</v>

718
00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:55.360
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated,</v>

719
00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:59.620
<v Speaker 1>but if there's any eradicable core and it's predicated on something like the</v>

720
00:29:59.621 --> 00:30:04.120
<v Speaker 1>necessity of iterating gates and all of that emergence of morality that we can</v>

721
00:30:04.121 --> 00:30:04.930
<v Speaker 1>then map.</v>

722
00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:06.350
<v Speaker 1>And you know what this like.</v>

723
00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:07.990
<v Speaker 1>Here's an example of this.</v>

724
00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:13.650
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that you have no fun going to get past the one actually magic pageant</v>

725
00:30:14.891 --> 00:30:15.724
<v Speaker 1>that you're even,</v>

726
00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:21.430
<v Speaker 1>let's say a talking to your son about playing hockey or your daughter playing</v>

727
00:30:21.641 --> 00:30:22.720
<v Speaker 1>soccer or whatever,</v>

728
00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:23.943
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

729
00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:24.311
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

730
00:30:24.311 --> 00:30:24.521
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

731
00:30:24.521 --> 00:30:27.780
<v Speaker 1>you see them all the field and they're kind of walking football,</v>

732
00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:28.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

733
00:30:28.511 --> 00:30:33.511
<v Speaker 1>and if you bring it back the way it made me think of your soccer player and she</v>

734
00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:33.791
<v Speaker 1>wins,</v>

735
00:30:33.791 --> 00:30:35.110
<v Speaker 1>maybe she scores the winning goal,</v>

736
00:30:35.111 --> 00:30:39.640
<v Speaker 1>but there's part of you this not too happy about that because you know,</v>

737
00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:42.160
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't any branded scan along with it.</v>

738
00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:45.840
<v Speaker 1>And so you're and off the field and you say,</v>

739
00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:46.860
<v Speaker 1>look Kiddo,</v>

740
00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:47.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

741
00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:48.640
<v Speaker 1>he did a great job in,</v>

742
00:30:48.650 --> 00:30:50.830
<v Speaker 1>or maybe you're even the best soccer player up there on the field,</v>

743
00:30:50.831 --> 00:30:51.850
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

744
00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:55.660
<v Speaker 1>you read the play fair and that's that idea.</v>

745
00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:56.553
<v Speaker 1>And she says,</v>

746
00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:57.890
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean I'm the best?</v>

747
00:30:57.900 --> 00:30:59.070
<v Speaker 1>They're up there and I won.</v>

748
00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:00.483
<v Speaker 1>And you're thinking,</v>

749
00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:02.073
<v Speaker 1>well that's true.</v>

750
00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:03.870
<v Speaker 1>And then you show up because what do you know?</v>

751
00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:05.110
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to say?</v>

752
00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:07.000
<v Speaker 1>Because you don't know how to explain it.</v>

753
00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:10.560
<v Speaker 1>You've gotten a sense that something went wrong and he said,</v>

754
00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:10.751
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

755
00:31:10.751 --> 00:31:10.931
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

756
00:31:10.931 --> 00:31:12.820
<v Speaker 1>you have to let other people have a chance.</v>

757
00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:13.481
<v Speaker 1>Maybe she says,</v>

758
00:31:13.481 --> 00:31:13.691
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

759
00:31:13.691 --> 00:31:13.901
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

760
00:31:13.901 --> 00:31:15.040
<v Speaker 1>but then we won't win.</v>

761
00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:16.233
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

762
00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:20.103
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

763
00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:22.330
<v Speaker 1>and you don't want to sleep.</v>

764
00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:25.090
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to teach your daughter to have Katie on the other players.</v>

765
00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:26.120
<v Speaker 1>That's not what you're saying,</v>

766
00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:27.131
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

767
00:31:27.131 --> 00:31:27.700
<v Speaker 1>but here's,</v>

768
00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:28.533
<v Speaker 1>here's what,</v>

769
00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:29.950
<v Speaker 1>here's what you know,</v>

770
00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:31.090
<v Speaker 1>and this is so cool.</v>

771
00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:32.620
<v Speaker 1>This is a good example of how it use the,</v>

772
00:31:32.621 --> 00:31:33.011
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

773
00:31:33.011 --> 00:31:34.270
<v Speaker 1>way more than you know,</v>

774
00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:37.450
<v Speaker 1>which is also something really worth knowing because you're really complicated.</v>

775
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:41.710
<v Speaker 1>You're way more complicated than you think and way more complicated than you</v>

776
00:31:41.711 --> 00:31:42.461
<v Speaker 1>even could know.</v>

777
00:31:42.461 --> 00:31:42.911
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

778
00:31:42.911 --> 00:31:45.370
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of things that you don't know that they'll have it.</v>

779
00:31:45.371 --> 00:31:50.371
<v Speaker 1>You can't say so as you're quieter than you are smart and some ways,</v>

780
00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:51.191
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

781
00:31:51.191 --> 00:31:51.880
<v Speaker 1>Because otherwise we,</v>

782
00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:52.960
<v Speaker 1>with Nita psychology,</v>

783
00:31:52.961 --> 00:31:56.130
<v Speaker 1>we would have to figure ourselves out and just be transparent to each other or</v>

784
00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:56.740
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>

785
00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:59.260
<v Speaker 1>So you have your daughter and you say,</v>

786
00:31:59.330 --> 00:32:00.980
<v Speaker 1>so you were this little Kiddo.</v>

787
00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:03.520
<v Speaker 1>There isn't a soccer game.</v>

788
00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:04.900
<v Speaker 1>It's an illusion.</v>

789
00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:07.120
<v Speaker 1>There's a sequence of soccer games.</v>

790
00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:09.970
<v Speaker 1>And so if you are trying to win the soccer game,</v>

791
00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:14.500
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to win the sec of soccer game and the rules for winning the</v>

792
00:32:14.501 --> 00:32:19.501
<v Speaker 1>surface soccer games in not exactly the same as winning what soccer game and you</v>

793
00:32:19.631 --> 00:32:22.540
<v Speaker 1>don't want a win one soccer game in a way that stops you from wanting to</v>

794
00:32:22.541 --> 00:32:22.990
<v Speaker 1>separate.</v>

795
00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:23.910
<v Speaker 1>Also forget.</v>

796
00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:26.380
<v Speaker 1>And if you're gonna to said of all soccer games,</v>

797
00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:28.710
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're going to play soccer for the next 10 years.</v>

798
00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:29.590
<v Speaker 1>So what does that mean?</v>

799
00:32:29.591 --> 00:32:34.120
<v Speaker 1>It means you have to learn how to develop your teammates because not every team</v>

800
00:32:34.121 --> 00:32:36.880
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be on as a winning team and sometimes you're not going to be the</v>

801
00:32:36.881 --> 00:32:37.750
<v Speaker 1>best player.</v>

802
00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:41.330
<v Speaker 1>And so you better figure out how to going to figure out how to bring those with</v>

803
00:32:41.331 --> 00:32:42.164
<v Speaker 1>you up,</v>

804
00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:44.180
<v Speaker 1>up in the developmental course.</v>

805
00:32:44.181 --> 00:32:47.540
<v Speaker 1>And you better learn how to treat your opponents with respect.</v>

806
00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:50.750
<v Speaker 1>You're going to learn how to play properly because then you'll be able to leave</v>

807
00:32:50.751 --> 00:32:52.530
<v Speaker 1>the second of all possible soccer games.</v>

808
00:32:52.531 --> 00:32:53.870
<v Speaker 1>So that's way better price.</v>

809
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:58.990
<v Speaker 1>And then you might start seeing more complicated than that because it is the set</v>

810
00:32:59.221 --> 00:33:00.190
<v Speaker 1>of all soccer games.</v>

811
00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:01.033
<v Speaker 1>That's the issue.</v>

812
00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:05.510
<v Speaker 1>It's the set of possible games and that's what they're trying to win.</v>

813
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:09.800
<v Speaker 1>And so how do you in the set of all possible games or that that's the real</v>

814
00:33:09.801 --> 00:33:10.670
<v Speaker 1>ethical question.</v>

815
00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:14.090
<v Speaker 1>How is it that you conduct yourself in life so that you maximize your</v>

816
00:33:14.091 --> 00:33:16.680
<v Speaker 1>probability of winning the set of possible gates?</v>

817
00:33:16.690 --> 00:33:18.830
<v Speaker 1>Because that means that wherever you're sat down,</v>

818
00:33:18.890 --> 00:33:20.480
<v Speaker 1>you're going to do well,</v>

819
00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.280
<v Speaker 1>and that's something that you want to know,</v>

820
00:33:22.281 --> 00:33:24.410
<v Speaker 1>that that's what it means to have character.</v>

821
00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:26.420
<v Speaker 1>That's what it means to be a good person.</v>

822
00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:29.270
<v Speaker 1>It's not that you don't do bad things because they're afraid of the</v>

823
00:33:29.271 --> 00:33:30.140
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>

824
00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:31.640
<v Speaker 1>That's not it at all.</v>

825
00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:34.310
<v Speaker 1>It's that no matter where you are in place,</v>

826
00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:39.860
<v Speaker 1>you're ready and that's because he's got a Cherokee as because to learn to play</v>

827
00:33:39.861 --> 00:33:40.760
<v Speaker 1>the property.</v>

828
00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:41.610
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you say,</v>

829
00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:41.751
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

830
00:33:41.751 --> 00:33:42.584
<v Speaker 1>what do you want?</v>

831
00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:44.150
<v Speaker 1>What do you want for your child?</v>

832
00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:48.350
<v Speaker 1>You want to teach them how to play so that everyone always invites them to play</v>

833
00:33:48.351 --> 00:33:49.184
<v Speaker 1>games.</v>

834
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:50.400
<v Speaker 1>Because Nicole,</v>

835
00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:51.320
<v Speaker 1>everyone says,</v>

836
00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:51.431
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

837
00:33:51.431 --> 00:33:52.280
<v Speaker 1>do you want to play?</v>

838
00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:56.600
<v Speaker 1>And then it wherever me know that's what they did to do and you know there's</v>

839
00:33:56.601 --> 00:34:00.020
<v Speaker 1>some of you in the audience who were extraordinarily successful perhaps as a</v>

840
00:34:00.021 --> 00:34:03.480
<v Speaker 1>consequences of your own marriage as well as let's say the grace of God.</v>

841
00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:04.471
<v Speaker 1>Part of that is,</v>

842
00:34:04.471 --> 00:34:08.330
<v Speaker 1>but you know you play well with others and so wherever you go,</v>

843
00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:10.190
<v Speaker 1>you drop a reputation around you.</v>

844
00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:12.920
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're a little more generous than you have to be.</v>

845
00:34:12.921 --> 00:34:17.210
<v Speaker 1>Even maybe share a little more credit that would be perfectly justifiable and</v>

846
00:34:17.211 --> 00:34:17.741
<v Speaker 1>you go off,</v>

847
00:34:17.741 --> 00:34:18.210
<v Speaker 1>you're waiting,</v>

848
00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:19.490
<v Speaker 1>develop other people,</v>

849
00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:19.950
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

850
00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:23.270
<v Speaker 1>and it's because you don't care if you planned right now,</v>

851
00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:27.710
<v Speaker 1>you're just trying to set yourself up and everyone else for something way,</v>

852
00:34:27.810 --> 00:34:28.520
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

853
00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:30.140
<v Speaker 1>way better than that,</v>

854
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:34.610
<v Speaker 1>and that's the purpose of the development of character and that's a real thing.</v>

855
00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:36.650
<v Speaker 1>It's not something statement.</v>

856
00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:40.640
<v Speaker 1>It's not some arbitrary statement for people who are easy going kind of finger</v>

857
00:34:40.641 --> 00:34:41.750
<v Speaker 1>wagging morality.</v>

858
00:34:41.970 --> 00:34:45.950
<v Speaker 1>It's not something that can easily dismiss by oral relative to say,</v>

859
00:34:45.951 --> 00:34:46.610
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

860
00:34:46.610 --> 00:34:48.890
<v Speaker 1>our culture is radically different everywhere.</v>

861
00:34:48.891 --> 00:34:49.440
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

862
00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:50.273
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

863
00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:52.910
<v Speaker 1>like the languages are radically different everywhere,</v>

864
00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:54.830
<v Speaker 1>but there's a core down there.</v>

865
00:34:54.890 --> 00:34:56.960
<v Speaker 1>Then we don't just share it with other human beings.</v>

866
00:34:56.961 --> 00:34:58.400
<v Speaker 1>We share them with other animals,</v>

867
00:34:58.490 --> 00:35:00.530
<v Speaker 1>which is why you can get along with the dog fruits,</v>

868
00:35:00.531 --> 00:35:01.130
<v Speaker 1>apple,</v>

869
00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:02.900
<v Speaker 1>because if you have a dog in the door,</v>

870
00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:07.760
<v Speaker 1>so it's at least in part because we're playing fair with the dog and if you're</v>

871
00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:09.570
<v Speaker 1>playing with a rope,</v>

872
00:35:09.571 --> 00:35:12.200
<v Speaker 1>but the adults pulling on it and he insulated dog,</v>

873
00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:17.210
<v Speaker 1>little horrible noisy dog and your political role is it sometimes let the dorm</v>

874
00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:19.740
<v Speaker 1>with enhance a little fit.</v>

875
00:35:19.741 --> 00:35:21.040
<v Speaker 1>That happiness rating sheets,</v>

876
00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:21.950
<v Speaker 1>the wrote back and forth,</v>

877
00:35:21.951 --> 00:35:23.030
<v Speaker 1>but he runs around in circles.</v>

878
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.720
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

879
00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:24.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

880
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:27.530
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to be top dog for a minute and then maybe he'll play with you</v>

881
00:35:27.531 --> 00:35:27.891
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

882
00:35:27.891 --> 00:35:30.740
<v Speaker 1>So you're smart after you it with dogs.</v>

883
00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:34.700
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that you know how to play therapy with dogs indicates that there's</v>

884
00:35:34.701 --> 00:35:38.820
<v Speaker 1>something about playing fairly transcends position.</v>

885
00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:41.190
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things I've learned,</v>

886
00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:42.560
<v Speaker 1>I think this is so cool.</v>

887
00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:46.110
<v Speaker 1>It's really what I'd be trying to express what I turned from express tonight</v>

888
00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:48.030
<v Speaker 1>because it's such an amazing idea.</v>

889
00:35:48.031 --> 00:35:51.180
<v Speaker 1>It's just ever since I realized this idea,</v>

890
00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:56.210
<v Speaker 1>just it's just I can't even think that are just absolutely blowing me away.</v>

891
00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:57.700
<v Speaker 1>So favorable,</v>

892
00:35:57.700 --> 00:35:59.100
<v Speaker 1>not feel about this.</v>

893
00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:03.450
<v Speaker 1>So imagine you have a game and there's a way to play the game to win.</v>

894
00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:04.790
<v Speaker 1>We already said why you need game,</v>

895
00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:05.011
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

896
00:36:05.011 --> 00:36:07.680
<v Speaker 1>Because you have your purpose in life.</v>

897
00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:10.590
<v Speaker 1>We'll call that an eight because there's a bunch of different ways you could do</v>

898
00:36:10.591 --> 00:36:10.740
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

899
00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:12.180
<v Speaker 1>So that's how you do it.</v>

900
00:36:12.181 --> 00:36:14.790
<v Speaker 1>Even in a game you play monopoly,</v>

901
00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:17.120
<v Speaker 1>you're goal is to fill the pool,</v>

902
00:36:17.121 --> 00:36:18.450
<v Speaker 1>the money and you're like,</v>

903
00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:20.520
<v Speaker 1>isn't the meaning to your life momentarily?</v>

904
00:36:20.521 --> 00:36:22.830
<v Speaker 1>Because it's a little microcosm of reality,</v>

905
00:36:22.831 --> 00:36:24.450
<v Speaker 1>which is why you play the game.</v>

906
00:36:24.451 --> 00:36:25.284
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

907
00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:26.131
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

908
00:36:26.131 --> 00:36:31.090
<v Speaker 1>so now imagine there's gain single game and there's a way to play it so that you</v>

909
00:36:31.091 --> 00:36:31.924
<v Speaker 1>can win,</v>

910
00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.060
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

911
00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:35.700
<v Speaker 1>But then we're gonna and that's why the pyramid,</v>

912
00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:36.420
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

913
00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:41.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm asking if there's a whole set of those pyramids and then you can imagine</v>

914
00:36:41.311 --> 00:36:45.120
<v Speaker 1>that each waiting to win in each of those games is slightly different,</v>

915
00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:46.340
<v Speaker 1>but there's.</v>

916
00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:50.610
<v Speaker 1>There's commonality across stuff that will be being a good sport plane fair or</v>

917
00:36:50.611 --> 00:36:51.271
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

918
00:36:51.271 --> 00:36:52.870
<v Speaker 1>There's commonality across the board.</v>

919
00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:53.731
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

920
00:36:53.731 --> 00:36:53.911
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

921
00:36:53.911 --> 00:36:54.721
<v Speaker 1>so imaginative.</v>

922
00:36:54.721 --> 00:36:59.220
<v Speaker 1>What you're trying to do is to set yourself up so you're the best player no</v>

923
00:36:59.221 --> 00:37:00.680
<v Speaker 1>matter what game comes up.</v>

924
00:37:01.290 --> 00:37:01.621
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

925
00:37:01.621 --> 00:37:02.690
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>

926
00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:04.230
<v Speaker 1>it's more complicated than that too,</v>

927
00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:05.660
<v Speaker 1>because then it has been.</v>

928
00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:10.050
<v Speaker 1>You were trying to figure out what that would look like because what you want to</v>

929
00:37:10.051 --> 00:37:13.600
<v Speaker 1>be able to grasp it and articulate it in representative because you.</v>

930
00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:16.680
<v Speaker 1>Because help you act it out and it would help you teach on people that acted</v>

931
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:17.150
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

932
00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:20.930
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what have been doing for thousands.</v>

933
00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:22.770
<v Speaker 1>Tens of thousands of years.</v>

934
00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:25.470
<v Speaker 1>We've been watching how things work,</v>

935
00:37:25.471 --> 00:37:26.251
<v Speaker 1>how people work.</v>

936
00:37:26.251 --> 00:37:29.370
<v Speaker 1>We'd be watching the fact that we wouldn't in hierarchies and that there's a set</v>

937
00:37:29.371 --> 00:37:30.280
<v Speaker 1>of hierarchies,</v>

938
00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:31.890
<v Speaker 1>and then we'd be watching and seeing,</v>

939
00:37:31.891 --> 00:37:32.640
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

940
00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:36.880
<v Speaker 1>some people are successful in moving up these hierarchies of going out hard</v>

941
00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:38.310
<v Speaker 1>because that's too limited.</v>

942
00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:39.530
<v Speaker 1>The second hierarchies.</v>

943
00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:43.180
<v Speaker 1>So then imagine that there's a pattern that characterize this.</v>

944
00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:47.550
<v Speaker 1>A person who tends to rise to the crop set at all hierarchies.</v>

945
00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:48.840
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

946
00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:50.220
<v Speaker 1>that's a mythological hero.</v>

947
00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:52.710
<v Speaker 1>That's what the logical hero is.</v>

948
00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:53.610
<v Speaker 1>And then pattern.</v>

949
00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:57.500
<v Speaker 1>There's a pattern to that and it's been recognized cross culturally,</v>

950
00:37:57.510 --> 00:38:00.540
<v Speaker 1>which is why continually pops up in mythology and popular culture.</v>

951
00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:01.740
<v Speaker 1>So part of that,</v>

952
00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:06.810
<v Speaker 1>part of that category is the willingness to confront that you don't know,</v>

953
00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:07.711
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

954
00:38:07.711 --> 00:38:08.281
<v Speaker 1>Because you think,</v>

955
00:38:08.281 --> 00:38:08.760
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

956
00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:10.780
<v Speaker 1>how do you expand your ability?</v>

957
00:38:11.070 --> 00:38:12.660
<v Speaker 1>You don't just hide and what you know,</v>

958
00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:14.100
<v Speaker 1>you don't just stay in one game.</v>

959
00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:18.200
<v Speaker 1>You don't think that's the total world because what's your name falls apart.</v>

960
00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:19.830
<v Speaker 1>We'll have you lost,</v>

961
00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:22.980
<v Speaker 1>or what if it's a perfect game and you went to Mexico catastrophe.</v>

962
00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:24.120
<v Speaker 1>None of that's good.</v>

963
00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:26.640
<v Speaker 1>You can't just be the pastor of a single game.</v>

964
00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:27.661
<v Speaker 1>You have to look.</v>

965
00:38:27.661 --> 00:38:30.330
<v Speaker 1>I'll try not to have to open yourself up to the unknown.</v>

966
00:38:30.331 --> 00:38:34.680
<v Speaker 1>You have to always understand that there's a bunch of things that you don't know</v>

967
00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:35.723
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

968
00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:37.723
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

969
00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:38.060
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

970
00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:41.860
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see her again in the knowledge center.</v>

971
00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:47.040
<v Speaker 1>If you could open yourself up so the white you don't know so you can interact</v>

972
00:38:47.201 --> 00:38:48.020
<v Speaker 1>and what you don't know,</v>

973
00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:52.340
<v Speaker 1>you can make yourself more than you are and so that's the stance to take,</v>

974
00:38:52.341 --> 00:38:55.610
<v Speaker 1>which is why in chapter one I ask people to stand up straight with your</v>

975
00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:58.690
<v Speaker 1>shoulders back because that's how you expose yourself to the world.</v>

976
00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:03.580
<v Speaker 1>It's a confident stance and it means that you're ready to take on that which is</v>

977
00:39:03.581 --> 00:39:04.600
<v Speaker 1>still beyond you,</v>

978
00:39:04.601 --> 00:39:07.840
<v Speaker 1>and so that's what the characteristics of the heroes that they hero voluntarily</v>

979
00:39:07.841 --> 00:39:10.180
<v Speaker 1>confronts the on your own and that's an old,</v>

980
00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:11.073
<v Speaker 1>old,</v>

981
00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:11.980
<v Speaker 1>old,</v>

982
00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:13.090
<v Speaker 1>old story.</v>

983
00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:15.280
<v Speaker 1>It might be the oldest story.</v>

984
00:39:15.281 --> 00:39:20.260
<v Speaker 1>It might be the story of matter of time and now that there's more to the story</v>

985
00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:23.110
<v Speaker 1>than not because the next question mark people,</v>

986
00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:25.210
<v Speaker 1>what happens if you do open yourself up to that?</v>

987
00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:26.083
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

988
00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:26.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

989
00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:29.280
<v Speaker 1>you all know that already you die,</v>

990
00:39:29.281 --> 00:39:30.100
<v Speaker 1>then you die.</v>

991
00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:34.100
<v Speaker 1>Multiple deaths do that so we know if when you,</v>

992
00:39:34.101 --> 00:39:36.970
<v Speaker 1>when you stumble across something you don't understand and it knocks you for a</v>

993
00:39:36.971 --> 00:39:37.750
<v Speaker 1>loop,</v>

994
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:39.100
<v Speaker 1>that's often very painful.</v>

995
00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:40.840
<v Speaker 1>Even if you've prepared yourself for it,</v>

996
00:39:40.841 --> 00:39:42.460
<v Speaker 1>you know so you know perfectly well,</v>

997
00:39:42.461 --> 00:39:47.461
<v Speaker 1>but those times in your life where you learn what you needed to learn,</v>

998
00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:48.820
<v Speaker 1>that didn't come up,</v>

999
00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:51.210
<v Speaker 1>that incompetence of blood right,</v>

1000
00:39:51.211 --> 00:39:54.310
<v Speaker 1>if that's when you have a crisis and maybe you heartbeat bloody well,</v>

1001
00:39:54.311 --> 00:39:59.311
<v Speaker 1>get through and and you're suffering from it and maybe doubting the validity of</v>

1002
00:39:59.441 --> 00:40:00.191
<v Speaker 1>your existence.</v>

1003
00:40:00.191 --> 00:40:02.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like the worst thing that ever happened to you and then you come out the</v>

1004
00:40:02.921 --> 00:40:03.754
<v Speaker 1>other end.</v>

1005
00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:05.051
<v Speaker 1>Saturday,</v>

1006
00:40:05.051 --> 00:40:06.060
<v Speaker 1>maybe budweiser,</v>

1007
00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.570
<v Speaker 1>but also more competent,</v>

1008
00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:08.860
<v Speaker 1>maybe more compassionate,</v>

1009
00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:09.830
<v Speaker 1>maybe wiser,</v>

1010
00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:10.960
<v Speaker 1>and you think whole path.</v>

1011
00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:15.010
<v Speaker 1>I went down into the underworld and I came back out with it and that's the</v>

1012
00:40:15.011 --> 00:40:16.030
<v Speaker 1>pathway through life.</v>

1013
00:40:16.031 --> 00:40:16.540
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1014
00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:17.620
<v Speaker 1>that's how you learn.</v>

1015
00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:21.280
<v Speaker 1>You're here and you're trying to get there and there is better,</v>

1016
00:40:21.281 --> 00:40:22.990
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't a linear pathway.</v>

1017
00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:24.650
<v Speaker 1>If you want to get from here to there,</v>

1018
00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:28.810
<v Speaker 1>we usually go down first and add up and so that's the best,</v>

1019
00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:30.340
<v Speaker 1>the hearables into the underworld,</v>

1020
00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:31.510
<v Speaker 1>to face the dragon,</v>

1021
00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:32.710
<v Speaker 1>to get the goal,</v>

1022
00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:35.020
<v Speaker 1>to emerge backup triathlete,</v>

1023
00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:39.400
<v Speaker 1>and to share that with the community and we know that the oldest written story</v>

1024
00:40:39.401 --> 00:40:44.220
<v Speaker 1>we have is exactly that story that stick a new dish or you do a image for me</v>

1025
00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:49.470
<v Speaker 1>from the Dantians is the Oxford story we have and it's the basis of all so much</v>

1026
00:40:49.751 --> 00:40:53.320
<v Speaker 1>with what you watch is the basis of the advantages and it's the basis of star</v>

1027
00:40:53.321 --> 00:40:57.280
<v Speaker 1>wars and it's the basis of star Trek and all this mythology that you see all the</v>

1028
00:40:57.281 --> 00:41:01.810
<v Speaker 1>screaming as plugged in to replace our religious preconceptions with the same</v>

1029
00:41:01.811 --> 00:41:02.710
<v Speaker 1>old material.</v>

1030
00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:03.970
<v Speaker 1>It's Harry Potter.</v>

1031
00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:04.751
<v Speaker 1>It's all of that.</v>

1032
00:41:04.751 --> 00:41:07.990
<v Speaker 1>I've been hearing partner dies in this reform to overcome evil.</v>

1033
00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:09.910
<v Speaker 1>If you ever heard that story before,</v>

1034
00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:11.530
<v Speaker 1>a chest bone with curiosity,</v>

1035
00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:15.430
<v Speaker 1>that is what happens is it is what happens.</v>

1036
00:41:15.431 --> 00:41:19.990
<v Speaker 1>Because like some of the times when you encounter something terrible in your</v>

1037
00:41:19.991 --> 00:41:20.280
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

1038
00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:22.450
<v Speaker 1>when you're moving forward towards the goal,</v>

1039
00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:26.790
<v Speaker 1>what you've encountered might be the terrible part of another person or maybe a</v>

1040
00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:29.340
<v Speaker 1>bb trade terribly by someone you trusted,</v>

1041
00:41:29.590 --> 00:41:30.060
<v Speaker 1>but they don't.</v>

1042
00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:33.070
<v Speaker 1>It's not not all that uncommon for that,</v>

1043
00:41:35.850 --> 00:41:36.980
<v Speaker 1>and that's even worse.</v>

1044
00:41:36.981 --> 00:41:37.221
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1045
00:41:37.221 --> 00:41:37.821
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

1046
00:41:37.821 --> 00:41:42.130
<v Speaker 1>very common for people who develop post traumatic stress disorder to develop</v>

1047
00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:44.300
<v Speaker 1>because they be trained themselves,</v>

1048
00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:44.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1049
00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:47.600
<v Speaker 1>They saw them develop posttraumatic stress disorder.</v>

1050
00:41:47.601 --> 00:41:51.290
<v Speaker 1>This happens in military and accomplish a lot the person who watched themselves</v>

1051
00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:53.430
<v Speaker 1>do something so fruit don't make your own.</v>

1052
00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:58.340
<v Speaker 1>Imagine how we put it possibly has done it and maybe they enjoy and then they're</v>

1053
00:41:58.341 --> 00:41:59.510
<v Speaker 1>never the same again.</v>

1054
00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:03.350
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is what made it had an encounter with malevolence.</v>

1055
00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:07.550
<v Speaker 1>They had an encounter with evil monster wave up to put and it's not in front of</v>

1056
00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:10.710
<v Speaker 1>and strong into that world and half destroyed them.</v>

1057
00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:12.290
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes you don't get out of that.</v>

1058
00:42:12.291 --> 00:42:14.210
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you do not recover from that.</v>

1059
00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:15.350
<v Speaker 1>This is real.</v>

1060
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.090
<v Speaker 1>It's a real place,</v>

1061
00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:17.933
<v Speaker 1>the underworld,</v>

1062
00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:19.610
<v Speaker 1>and you could easily get dropped it,</v>

1063
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:24.200
<v Speaker 1>but the mythological hero goes into the underworld and this recording comes out</v>

1064
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:26.570
<v Speaker 1>triumphant and that's the story of life.</v>

1065
00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:30.530
<v Speaker 1>And you'll do that on your way to developing this ability to move up the</v>

1066
00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:31.373
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>

1067
00:42:31.870 --> 00:42:32.703
<v Speaker 1>Know.</v>

1068
00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:34.940
<v Speaker 1>So maybe if I can hear something,</v>

1069
00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:37.070
<v Speaker 1>it's also extraordinarily cool.</v>

1070
00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:38.443
<v Speaker 1>So imagine</v>

1071
00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:42.710
<v Speaker 1>there's a hierarchy between soccer game.</v>

1072
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:45.830
<v Speaker 1>If you wait the game that you're at the top of the hierarchy,</v>

1073
00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:49.130
<v Speaker 1>everybody puts you off on their shoulders and they turn me around the field.</v>

1074
00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:51.790
<v Speaker 1>A field that's an indication that you're.</v>

1075
00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:55.010
<v Speaker 1>You're top boxster for a moment and then you think,</v>

1076
00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:55.581
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1077
00:42:55.581 --> 00:42:57.020
<v Speaker 1>is there anything about that?</v>

1078
00:42:57.080 --> 00:43:01.860
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything above the painful of the pyramid and raise different ideas?</v>

1079
00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:03.580
<v Speaker 1>It's about the pyramid that had been denied.</v>

1080
00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:06.260
<v Speaker 1>The idea that you go through the eye by a horus,</v>

1081
00:43:06.261 --> 00:43:06.861
<v Speaker 1>the Egyptian,</v>

1082
00:43:06.861 --> 00:43:11.861
<v Speaker 1>I find a bit of attention and it's above the pyramid because the first thing</v>

1083
00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:16.040
<v Speaker 1>winds to Senegal Games is the victor over the person who wins the single gay,</v>

1084
00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:19.610
<v Speaker 1>and that means there's something outside each parent that's above it and</v>

1085
00:43:19.611 --> 00:43:20.310
<v Speaker 1>transcendent.</v>

1086
00:43:20.310 --> 00:43:24.300
<v Speaker 1>That's the ultimate value and that's the idea of the king of all kings and</v>

1087
00:43:24.301 --> 00:43:28.180
<v Speaker 1>something like that and hero of all heroes and that's an image that you call it</v>

1088
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:32.920
<v Speaker 1>your imagination and you can identify with you see it and calls to forward.</v>

1089
00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:37.930
<v Speaker 1>Because this has been going on for so long while since rostered xbox $350</v>

1090
00:43:38.931 --> 00:43:39.710
<v Speaker 1>million years.</v>

1091
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:41.570
<v Speaker 1>It's really a long time.</v>

1092
00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:43.820
<v Speaker 1>It's longer than their whiskey trees.</v>

1093
00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:45.650
<v Speaker 1>It's really a long time.</v>

1094
00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:49.820
<v Speaker 1>This has been going on forever and we understand that.</v>

1095
00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:54.470
<v Speaker 1>We can recognize it even if we can't articulate it and when you spontaneously</v>

1096
00:43:54.471 --> 00:43:55.370
<v Speaker 1>admire someone,</v>

1097
00:43:55.371 --> 00:43:56.990
<v Speaker 1>especially for a long period of time.</v>

1098
00:43:57.050 --> 00:44:00.590
<v Speaker 1>The reason that you environment because they've manifested a fragment of the</v>

1099
00:44:00.591 --> 00:44:02.780
<v Speaker 1>behavior that makes a person a heroin.</v>

1100
00:44:02.781 --> 00:44:06.710
<v Speaker 1>Victor across sets of gates and that's the person who's courageous enough to</v>

1101
00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:10.650
<v Speaker 1>take on what they will get an understanding and let the part of the Mideast</v>

1102
00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:13.970
<v Speaker 1>worthy or sufficient parish as a consequence.</v>

1103
00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:16.940
<v Speaker 1>And that can be very painful and that's part of the.</v>

1104
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.420
<v Speaker 1>In the additional substrate which the idea of the desert,</v>

1105
00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:22.850
<v Speaker 1>the resurrected savior emergence.</v>

1106
00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:24.820
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the legacy.</v>

1107
00:44:25.330 --> 00:44:29.690
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea that our religious presuppositions are religious reconceptualize</v>

1108
00:44:29.691 --> 00:44:34.691
<v Speaker 1>say the ones in which western or on the superstitions is seriously wrong and we</v>

1109
00:44:36.871 --> 00:44:39.480
<v Speaker 1>don't really know the limit of that because you know,</v>

1110
00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:44.590
<v Speaker 1>we don't know how good we have some sense about how terrible and and Kevin Straw</v>

1111
00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:45.841
<v Speaker 1>person can be,</v>

1112
00:44:45.841 --> 00:44:48.990
<v Speaker 1>but we don't know how good nurses can be and we don't know what you wouldn't be</v>

1113
00:44:48.991 --> 00:44:53.730
<v Speaker 1>like if you adopted the pattern of the victor of the set of games that made that</v>

1114
00:44:53.731 --> 00:44:58.260
<v Speaker 1>your goal in life and you had the highest school you can possibly conceive of</v>

1115
00:44:58.261 --> 00:44:58.360
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1116
00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:00.930
<v Speaker 1>You made that your name would not be something.</v>

1117
00:45:01.170 --> 00:45:02.340
<v Speaker 1>And why not do it?</v>

1118
00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:04.130
<v Speaker 1>What the Hell's the alternative?</v>

1119
00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:04.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1120
00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:06.980
<v Speaker 1>some of it is that sort of bitterness and catastrophe.</v>

1121
00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:09.090
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that would be a good thing to avoid.</v>

1122
00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:11.610
<v Speaker 1>But who knows how far obvious.</v>

1123
00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:11.911
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1124
00:45:11.911 --> 00:45:14.070
<v Speaker 1>so wrong way up and you know,</v>

1125
00:45:14.071 --> 00:45:15.510
<v Speaker 1>you don't have anything better to do that,</v>

1126
00:45:15.550 --> 00:45:16.050
<v Speaker 1>David,</v>

1127
00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:16.590
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1128
00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:18.720
<v Speaker 1>And it's the adventure of your life.</v>

1129
00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:20.400
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about that.</v>

1130
00:45:20.490 --> 00:45:24.510
<v Speaker 1>And it's the only thing beyond the deeply pessimistic person that many ways,</v>

1131
00:45:24.511 --> 00:45:24.751
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1132
00:45:24.751 --> 00:45:29.751
<v Speaker 1>because I'm not naive about the depth of suffering that characterizes the</v>

1133
00:45:30.350 --> 00:45:32.130
<v Speaker 1>existence for all sorts of reasons,</v>

1134
00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:34.410
<v Speaker 1>partly because I woke as deeply as I could.</v>

1135
00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:38.790
<v Speaker 1>It took the atrocities that people are taking bullets big during war time,</v>

1136
00:45:38.791 --> 00:45:39.271
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1137
00:45:39.271 --> 00:45:43.140
<v Speaker 1>ordinary people to do things he can't imagine.</v>

1138
00:45:43.141 --> 00:45:44.280
<v Speaker 1>They can do things so terrible.</v>

1139
00:45:44.281 --> 00:45:48.120
<v Speaker 1>They're just reading about the will leave a mark on you that you can never</v>

1140
00:45:48.121 --> 00:45:48.954
<v Speaker 1>erase.</v>

1141
00:45:49.170 --> 00:45:51.680
<v Speaker 1>And then people suffered terribly and their you don't.</v>

1142
00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:52.930
<v Speaker 1>No matter how materially.</v>

1143
00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:56.820
<v Speaker 1>Fortunately our life is a very brutal business and there's no doubt that it's</v>

1144
00:45:56.821 --> 00:46:00.780
<v Speaker 1>painted seriously with malevolence and evil and that's the landscape.</v>

1145
00:46:00.781 --> 00:46:03.900
<v Speaker 1>But people were unbelievably</v>

1146
00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:09.270
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable sources of future potential.</v>

1147
00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:11.790
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it's different if it's some sentence in August,</v>

1148
00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:12.820
<v Speaker 1>I think about us.</v>

1149
00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:15.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't think of us as determined creatures,</v>

1150
00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:18.960
<v Speaker 1>deterministic creatures that money on our type like clockwork.</v>

1151
00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:24.060
<v Speaker 1>I look at a his creatures who face against the landscape of possibility of</v>

1152
00:46:24.061 --> 00:46:25.650
<v Speaker 1>potential that's in front of us.</v>

1153
00:46:25.830 --> 00:46:28.430
<v Speaker 1>And then we transform that intentional rejection.</v>

1154
00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:32.430
<v Speaker 1>All the partner of choice and our choices are between what stood at what is not</v>

1155
00:46:32.431 --> 00:46:33.030
<v Speaker 1>going to,</v>

1156
00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:36.930
<v Speaker 1>what's good and what's evil live as the choice we're making all the time in the</v>

1157
00:46:36.931 --> 00:46:40.980
<v Speaker 1>landscape of the quest and be making those choices when we confront,</v>

1158
00:46:40.990 --> 00:46:45.990
<v Speaker 1>potentially take the potential is very trump recently turned it into the reality</v>

1159
00:46:46.051 --> 00:46:49.470
<v Speaker 1>that we have and that we actually do that.</v>

1160
00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:51.330
<v Speaker 1>That's the consciousness ducks.</v>

1161
00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:53.010
<v Speaker 1>And I think that the idea,</v>

1162
00:46:53.011 --> 00:46:55.080
<v Speaker 1>and I made this up in my old lectures,</v>

1163
00:46:55.490 --> 00:46:56.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1164
00:46:56.070 --> 00:47:00.390
<v Speaker 1>I think the idea that human beings are made in the image of God,</v>

1165
00:47:00.450 --> 00:47:02.940
<v Speaker 1>God being that force of consciousness,</v>

1166
00:47:02.941 --> 00:47:07.941
<v Speaker 1>let's say that use this communication conscious communication structure</v>

1167
00:47:08.310 --> 00:47:09.143
<v Speaker 1>potential.</v>

1168
00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:13.200
<v Speaker 1>I do think that that's an accurate description of what human beings are.</v>

1169
00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:17.340
<v Speaker 1>I do think that's the role of consciousness and I think that not only do we</v>

1170
00:47:17.341 --> 00:47:20.970
<v Speaker 1>construct a landscape of infinite potential instream as we are,</v>

1171
00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:26.030
<v Speaker 1>but we also bring to that landscape are constrained infinite potential that we</v>

1172
00:47:26.041 --> 00:47:29.100
<v Speaker 1>can release if we have the courage to release it.</v>

1173
00:47:29.950 --> 00:47:34.300
<v Speaker 1>We released that by aiming as high as we care about having the courage to tell</v>

1174
00:47:34.301 --> 00:47:34.721
<v Speaker 1>the truth.</v>

1175
00:47:34.721 --> 00:47:35.410
<v Speaker 1>And to ask for,</v>

1176
00:47:35.410 --> 00:47:35.620
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1177
00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:38.080
<v Speaker 1>we have to conduct themselves properly in the world.</v>

1178
00:47:38.590 --> 00:47:39.400
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1179
00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:41.380
<v Speaker 1>deeply pessimistic as I.</v>

1180
00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:46.030
<v Speaker 1>I thought that idea more powerful than the pessimism.</v>

1181
00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:47.770
<v Speaker 1>I actually think it's.</v>

1182
00:47:47.890 --> 00:47:52.890
<v Speaker 1>I haven't found an idea that I think is more true than that and it's all taken</v>

1183
00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:57.730
<v Speaker 1>hamline tones to it because I wasn't looking for an idea that can be just taking</v>

1184
00:47:58.190 --> 00:48:00.520
<v Speaker 1>the first cohort comes along.</v>

1185
00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:01.483
<v Speaker 1>You need something.</v>

1186
00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:04.570
<v Speaker 1>You need a book that you can be in during a storm.</v>

1187
00:48:05.010 --> 00:48:05.730
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

1188
00:48:05.730 --> 00:48:08.230
<v Speaker 1>That's a boat and you can be during the storm.</v>

1189
00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:10.060
<v Speaker 1>Putting yourself together,</v>

1190
00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:11.980
<v Speaker 1>back to your own best interests,</v>

1191
00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:13.870
<v Speaker 1>put things together for your family,</v>

1192
00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:15.970
<v Speaker 1>put things together for your community.</v>

1193
00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:17.410
<v Speaker 1>A high take,</v>

1194
00:48:17.411 --> 00:48:22.120
<v Speaker 1>the potential that's in front of you and cast it to the world that you wish to</v>

1195
00:48:22.121 --> 00:48:23.560
<v Speaker 1>live in that dorm.</v>

1196
00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:25.390
<v Speaker 1>We have you do that.</v>

1197
00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:26.560
<v Speaker 1>That's what you do.</v>

1198
00:48:26.561 --> 00:48:28.090
<v Speaker 1>Whether you know it or not,</v>

1199
00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:30.820
<v Speaker 1>and that's why it's also true that the,</v>

1200
00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:34.900
<v Speaker 1>the destiny of the world and maybe more than the world rests on each of our</v>

1201
00:48:34.901 --> 00:48:35.800
<v Speaker 1>shoulders.</v>

1202
00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:37.120
<v Speaker 1>It's really the case.</v>

1203
00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:40.720
<v Speaker 1>It's because the individual is a very strange creature.</v>

1204
00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:41.080
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1205
00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:45.250
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to think of yourself as over 7 billion people in the that what the</v>

1206
00:48:45.251 --> 00:48:46.990
<v Speaker 1>hell difference does it make what you do?</v>

1207
00:48:47.290 --> 00:48:48.123
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1208
00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:49.721
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1209
00:48:49.721 --> 00:48:51.910
<v Speaker 1>you know that that's not a good way to think.</v>

1210
00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:53.263
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1211
00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:58.320
<v Speaker 1>You may not be able to think your way of thinking that because you can make a</v>

1212
00:48:59.291 --> 00:49:03.940
<v Speaker 1>logical and compelling case for the fact that you just the dust mote among 7</v>

1213
00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:08.300
<v Speaker 1>billion decimals in some corner of the galaxy and what the hell difference is</v>

1214
00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:10.200
<v Speaker 1>going to make it 100 million years anyway,</v>

1215
00:49:10.750 --> 00:49:12.880
<v Speaker 1>but there's a part of you that knows that.</v>

1216
00:49:12.881 --> 00:49:16.930
<v Speaker 1>That's no philosophy to sustain yourself with through life.</v>

1217
00:49:17.110 --> 00:49:19.720
<v Speaker 1>You know that and so you can't fake your way out of it,</v>

1218
00:49:19.770 --> 00:49:22.300
<v Speaker 1>but you know that isn't what a person is.</v>

1219
00:49:22.301 --> 00:49:23.230
<v Speaker 1>As far as I can tell.</v>

1220
00:49:23.230 --> 00:49:27.730
<v Speaker 1>You're a divine locus of consciousness and you are taking the process of</v>

1221
00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:32.760
<v Speaker 1>bringing order into Ba and you decided by your people decisions whether that</v>

1222
00:49:34.290 --> 00:49:37.870
<v Speaker 1>order is going to be tilted towards heaven or tilted towards health,</v>

1223
00:49:37.930 --> 00:49:42.160
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't believe that you should read your fair share of 20th century</v>

1224
00:49:42.161 --> 00:49:46.000
<v Speaker 1>history and the hundreds of billions of people who are who are killed and</v>

1225
00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:51.020
<v Speaker 1>destroyed the trade in prison can start brewed by people who were clearly aiming</v>

1226
00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:55.210
<v Speaker 1>down and then you ask yourself,</v>

1227
00:49:55.211 --> 00:49:55.361
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1228
00:49:55.361 --> 00:49:56.650
<v Speaker 1>do you just believe that?</v>

1229
00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:57.640
<v Speaker 1>You just believe that?</v>

1230
00:49:57.641 --> 00:50:02.590
<v Speaker 1>That's down to just believe that that's how it certainly close enough to help</v>

1231
00:50:02.591 --> 00:50:07.591
<v Speaker 1>for me and thinking if if it exists at that matter will then the opposite of</v>

1232
00:50:07.991 --> 00:50:12.730
<v Speaker 1>that exists dogs or whatever to the one from Auschwitz,</v>

1233
00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:13.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1234
00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:15.910
<v Speaker 1>That's where you're having wherever that is.</v>

1235
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:17.470
<v Speaker 1>It's not so easy to specify,</v>

1236
00:50:17.471 --> 00:50:18.090
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>

1237
00:50:18.090 --> 00:50:19.020
<v Speaker 1>It's at least we're.</v>

1238
00:50:19.021 --> 00:50:20.200
<v Speaker 1>That isn't term,</v>

1239
00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:23.950
<v Speaker 1>and you can start by making yourself into the sort of person who wouldn't take</v>

1240
00:50:23.951 --> 00:50:28.110
<v Speaker 1>that path that was put in front of the eye movement while you sure</v>

1241
00:50:32.370 --> 00:50:33.410
<v Speaker 1>people do.</v>

1242
00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:42.620
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

1243
00:50:49.690 --> 00:50:50.523
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1244
00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:55.613
<v Speaker 1>I'm</v>

1245
00:50:56.550 --> 00:50:57.383
<v Speaker 1>going</v>

1246
00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:05.410
<v Speaker 1>to tell you,</v>

1247
00:51:05.410 --> 00:51:08.440
<v Speaker 1>if you're interested in doing two things,</v>

1248
00:51:10.310 --> 00:51:11.143
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1249
00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:12.610
<v Speaker 1>in the upcoming weeks,</v>

1250
00:51:13.090 --> 00:51:16.440
<v Speaker 1>I just record the audio version of the</v>

1251
00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:28.700
<v Speaker 1>and 12 rules</v>

1252
00:51:30.830 --> 00:51:33.240
<v Speaker 1>for the work I did on that initial call.</v>

1253
00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:35.740
<v Speaker 1>I wrote in 1985 until 19.</v>

1254
00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:38.820
<v Speaker 1>I worked on it for about $3 a day just</v>

1255
00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:41.510
<v Speaker 1>to get the safe Taco.</v>

1256
00:51:41.511 --> 00:51:46.511
<v Speaker 1>It was very intense until I was trying to address the question that I kind of</v>

1257
00:51:47.211 --> 00:51:48.010
<v Speaker 1>started with debate,</v>

1258
00:51:48.010 --> 00:51:49.240
<v Speaker 1>which is</v>

1259
00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:55.400
<v Speaker 1>reasonable that there's such a thing as an epic universal.</v>

1260
00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:58.710
<v Speaker 1>Is that reasonable or is it just on?</v>

1261
00:52:00.290 --> 00:52:01.050
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1262
00:52:01.050 --> 00:52:01.280
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1263
00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:02.540
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know when I started working,</v>

1264
00:52:03.170 --> 00:52:06.750
<v Speaker 1>which can be the case because I'd say to me in the beginning,</v>

1265
00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:07.820
<v Speaker 1>and it was probably more like,</v>

1266
00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:09.610
<v Speaker 1>it was just a little arbitrary interpretation.</v>

1267
00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:12.650
<v Speaker 1>This is eastern 50 rationally know,</v>

1268
00:52:12.651 --> 00:52:15.200
<v Speaker 1>so it was a shock to me to just start with that.</v>

1269
00:52:15.201 --> 00:52:19.670
<v Speaker 1>That was wrong and was a real shock because it's really shocking to disturb</v>

1270
00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:24.120
<v Speaker 1>one thing when you're sort of at of evil.</v>

1271
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:28.370
<v Speaker 1>You think religious metaphor,</v>

1272
00:52:28.371 --> 00:52:29.980
<v Speaker 1>it's remote.</v>

1273
00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:30.291
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1274
00:52:30.291 --> 00:52:30.531
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1275
00:52:30.531 --> 00:52:32.120
<v Speaker 1>I actually just really real.</v>

1276
00:52:32.210 --> 00:52:34.070
<v Speaker 1>It's the most real thing.</v>

1277
00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:38.470
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievable to be real and I do think it manifested,</v>

1278
00:52:38.570 --> 00:52:43.010
<v Speaker 1>manifested itself in a terrible place in the 20th century as far as I'm</v>

1279
00:52:43.011 --> 00:52:43.700
<v Speaker 1>concerned.</v>

1280
00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:46.910
<v Speaker 1>It's no wonder people don't like this idea around me.</v>

1281
00:52:47.310 --> 00:52:49.560
<v Speaker 1>It means normally for rocking,</v>

1282
00:52:50.130 --> 00:52:53.810
<v Speaker 1>just a physical in the sense that he's done the ideas,</v>

1283
00:52:53.830 --> 00:52:54.650
<v Speaker 1>wanted to be involved,</v>

1284
00:52:54.650 --> 00:52:59.650
<v Speaker 1>but it's also existentially terrifying to understand that in some real sense,</v>

1285
00:52:59.661 --> 00:53:02.060
<v Speaker 1>the weight of the world is on your shoulders.</v>

1286
00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:04.960
<v Speaker 1>It reviews on your shoulders and that's a question burden.</v>

1287
00:53:04.990 --> 00:53:06.920
<v Speaker 1>It's no wonder people want to fly from that.</v>

1288
00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:09.390
<v Speaker 1>It's actually nice because people think,</v>

1289
00:53:09.391 --> 00:53:09.830
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1290
00:53:09.830 --> 00:53:11.480
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to have meaningful life,</v>

1291
00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:12.201
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1292
00:53:12.201 --> 00:53:13.360
<v Speaker 1>because what's the alternative?</v>

1293
00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:14.800
<v Speaker 1>A life that isn't.</v>

1294
00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:21.380
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to do anything.</v>

1295
00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:26.920
<v Speaker 1>That's the big payoff for being nihilistic and perhaps was just like it doesn't</v>

1296
00:53:27.570 --> 00:53:28.660
<v Speaker 1>even 100 million years.</v>

1297
00:53:28.661 --> 00:53:29.860
<v Speaker 1>It isn't that bad word,</v>

1298
00:53:29.861 --> 00:53:34.861
<v Speaker 1>is it a higher use that pretty much eliminates any responsibility from your</v>

1299
00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:36.653
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

1300
00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:42.440
<v Speaker 1>but if you're actually responsible for things or that natural whole different</v>

1301
00:53:42.541 --> 00:53:43.231
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>

1302
00:53:43.231 --> 00:53:45.900
<v Speaker 1>that means that it actually matters what you do.</v>

1303
00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:49.970
<v Speaker 1>It really that it doesn't just matter to you and Baxter,</v>

1304
00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:52.650
<v Speaker 1>everyone you know you're networked with other people.</v>

1305
00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:52.801
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1306
00:53:52.801 --> 00:53:53.670
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1307
00:53:54.090 --> 00:53:56.760
<v Speaker 1>I learned this partly a variety of different ways,</v>

1308
00:53:56.761 --> 00:54:00.000
<v Speaker 1>but I've learned a lot by reading about what happened in LLC,</v>

1309
00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:02.040
<v Speaker 1>Germany and in the Soviet Union.</v>

1310
00:54:02.130 --> 00:54:02.640
<v Speaker 1>Also.</v>

1311
00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:06.860
<v Speaker 1>I was trying all the other terrible totalitarian states because people debated.</v>

1312
00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:10.200
<v Speaker 1>Academics debated for a long time about why those things happened.</v>

1313
00:54:10.610 --> 00:54:11.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1314
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:11.731
<v Speaker 1>one theory is,</v>

1315
00:54:11.731 --> 00:54:12.210
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1316
00:54:12.210 --> 00:54:14.160
<v Speaker 1>people are bad and so you get corrupt.</v>

1317
00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:15.330
<v Speaker 1>Leaders have to talk board,</v>

1318
00:54:15.331 --> 00:54:20.000
<v Speaker 1>been emulating the masses and then the order perfectly good ordinary people to</v>

1319
00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:24.380
<v Speaker 1>do terrible things and that people are terrified and serving that are kind of</v>

1320
00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:27.790
<v Speaker 1>like sheep or they're terrified and then they go implement the malevolent to</v>

1321
00:54:27.930 --> 00:54:32.370
<v Speaker 1>dastardly plans of the leaders and that's a pretty credible idea,</v>

1322
00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:34.140
<v Speaker 1>but it's wrong.</v>

1323
00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:35.543
<v Speaker 1>It's wrong.</v>

1324
00:54:36.290 --> 00:54:40.660
<v Speaker 1>It's like in a totalitarian state like Nazi Germany or or,</v>

1325
00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:42.660
<v Speaker 1>or stokers Soviet Union.</v>

1326
00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:44.760
<v Speaker 1>Everyone was totalitarian.</v>

1327
00:54:45.210 --> 00:54:45.960
<v Speaker 1>Everyone.</v>

1328
00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:50.650
<v Speaker 1>It was bottom up and top down at the same time and so everybody in that society</v>

1329
00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:52.830
<v Speaker 1>was responsible for what the society was doing.</v>

1330
00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:56.750
<v Speaker 1>And I learned that by reading the people who really thought about those</v>

1331
00:54:56.751 --> 00:54:57.630
<v Speaker 1>societies.</v>

1332
00:54:57.690 --> 00:54:59.190
<v Speaker 1>If Viktor Frankl is a good example,</v>

1333
00:54:59.191 --> 00:55:00.870
<v Speaker 1>he wrote a book called Man's search for meaning,</v>

1334
00:55:00.871 --> 00:55:02.250
<v Speaker 1>which I highly recommend.</v>

1335
00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:04.230
<v Speaker 1>You know what Frankel's conclusions was,</v>

1336
00:55:04.231 --> 00:55:08.900
<v Speaker 1>that it was the proclivity of the normative person to lie and deceive the vent</v>

1337
00:55:08.901 --> 00:55:10.930
<v Speaker 1>to the excesses of the state.</v>

1338
00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:12.990
<v Speaker 1>The avoidance of responsibility.</v>

1339
00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:13.940
<v Speaker 1>As so as you said,</v>

1340
00:55:13.941 --> 00:55:17.970
<v Speaker 1>it's exactly the same thing about what happened in the Soviet Union in eastern</v>

1341
00:55:17.971 --> 00:55:18.510
<v Speaker 1>Germany.</v>

1342
00:55:18.510 --> 00:55:19.343
<v Speaker 1>Nice journey.</v>

1343
00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:22.310
<v Speaker 1>One third of people were government informants,</v>

1344
00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:25.060
<v Speaker 1>so you might number one,</v>

1345
00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:26.940
<v Speaker 1>it could have been convinced,</v>

1346
00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:27.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1347
00:55:27.770 --> 00:55:29.040
<v Speaker 1>Went back distance.</v>

1348
00:55:29.130 --> 00:55:30.690
<v Speaker 1>One out of three people.</v>

1349
00:55:30.930 --> 00:55:32.940
<v Speaker 1>So it means if you've got a family of six people,</v>

1350
00:55:32.941 --> 00:55:37.941
<v Speaker 1>two of your close family members were informing or you to a murderous machine,</v>

1351
00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:41.580
<v Speaker 1>and so that's the responsibility.</v>

1352
00:55:42.450 --> 00:55:45.060
<v Speaker 1>And so and so's netsuite and other people have said the same.</v>

1353
00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:48.930
<v Speaker 1>If you stand up and crib line that you can defeat a tyranny.</v>

1354
00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:49.621
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1355
00:55:49.621 --> 00:55:49.741
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1356
00:55:49.741 --> 00:55:51.110
<v Speaker 1>who the hell would ever get stopped?</v>

1357
00:55:51.150 --> 00:55:51.361
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1358
00:55:51.361 --> 00:55:53.580
<v Speaker 1>go under estimate the power of the truth.</v>

1359
00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:56.490
<v Speaker 1>You mean why is the term so powerful?</v>

1360
00:55:57.180 --> 00:55:58.460
<v Speaker 1>Because it's true.</v>

1361
00:55:58.490 --> 00:55:59.520
<v Speaker 1>It's reality,</v>

1362
00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:00.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1363
00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:01.350
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do?</v>

1364
00:56:01.350 --> 00:56:03.120
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have an argument with reality.</v>

1365
00:56:03.570 --> 00:56:04.740
<v Speaker 1>You think that's going work do,</v>

1366
00:56:04.741 --> 00:56:05.600
<v Speaker 1>yet you don't.</v>

1367
00:56:05.630 --> 00:56:08.230
<v Speaker 1>The only reason you ever think that is that you're.</v>

1368
00:56:08.290 --> 00:56:09.540
<v Speaker 1>You're willfully blind to get.</v>

1369
00:56:09.541 --> 00:56:14.500
<v Speaker 1>He refused to view the consequences of your actions or you think deep down in</v>

1370
00:56:14.501 --> 00:56:17.640
<v Speaker 1>your soul goes deep down at the theological level,</v>

1371
00:56:17.730 --> 00:56:19.830
<v Speaker 1>way below your conscious apprehensions.</v>

1372
00:56:19.831 --> 00:56:21.600
<v Speaker 1>Wave along your political sentiments.</v>

1373
00:56:21.650 --> 00:56:22.950
<v Speaker 1>When you blow your philosophy,</v>

1374
00:56:23.590 --> 00:56:26.190
<v Speaker 1>believe you can get away with it.</v>

1375
00:56:26.770 --> 00:56:29.920
<v Speaker 1>There's an arrogant beyond comprehension,</v>

1376
00:56:30.370 --> 00:56:34.300
<v Speaker 1>and you believe that you can tweak and twist the fabric of reality with your</v>

1377
00:56:34.301 --> 00:56:35.760
<v Speaker 1>thoughts and your actions at that.</v>

1378
00:56:35.790 --> 00:56:39.880
<v Speaker 1>Somehow you will be the beneficiary of that.</v>

1379
00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:40.601
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1380
00:56:40.601 --> 00:56:41.800
<v Speaker 1>good luck with that.</v>

1381
00:56:41.950 --> 00:56:42.610
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1382
00:56:42.610 --> 00:56:47.610
<v Speaker 1>That's all you have to think about that idea for about a year because it take</v>

1383
00:56:47.891 --> 00:56:52.150
<v Speaker 1>about a year to thinking through what is the possibility that that's true,</v>

1384
00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:57.600
<v Speaker 1>but you can take the structure of one is at twisted for your own purposes and</v>

1385
00:57:00.850 --> 00:57:03.160
<v Speaker 1>have that workout for you.</v>

1386
00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:04.930
<v Speaker 1>That's not,</v>

1387
00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:05.893
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1388
00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:06.940
<v Speaker 1>that's just not.</v>

1389
00:57:07.370 --> 00:57:08.500
<v Speaker 1>That's just not going anywhere.</v>

1390
00:57:08.501 --> 00:57:13.240
<v Speaker 1>That archaea all these people who go tangled up with you still tell it to her,</v>

1391
00:57:13.250 --> 00:57:13.960
<v Speaker 1>even jeans,</v>

1392
00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:14.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1393
00:57:14.530 --> 00:57:16.930
<v Speaker 1>they advocated through a little personal responsibility.</v>

1394
00:57:17.110 --> 00:57:20.080
<v Speaker 1>They thought their lives didn't matter or maybe they were willing to go along</v>

1395
00:57:20.110 --> 00:57:21.340
<v Speaker 1>for the sake of the vulnerability.</v>

1396
00:57:21.490 --> 00:57:24.230
<v Speaker 1>They have their reasons because these robots machines,</v>

1397
00:57:24.700 --> 00:57:25.650
<v Speaker 1>but the consequences,</v>

1398
00:57:25.651 --> 00:57:30.340
<v Speaker 1>but everything around with people did to hell blaming that on the leaders.</v>

1399
00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:33.100
<v Speaker 1>The leaders were manifestations of the,</v>

1400
00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:35.170
<v Speaker 1>of the metaphysical process,</v>

1401
00:57:35.250 --> 00:57:35.471
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1402
00:57:35.471 --> 00:57:37.660
<v Speaker 1>and they aren't spending along with the charisma.</v>

1403
00:57:37.661 --> 00:57:38.380
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1404
00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:42.790
<v Speaker 1>I read a lot about how Hitler figuring out how to talk to the crowd because</v>

1405
00:57:42.791 --> 00:57:46.630
<v Speaker 1>really interesting because Hitler was against the door door and you always want</v>

1406
00:57:46.631 --> 00:57:48.130
<v Speaker 1>to give the devil his due,</v>

1407
00:57:48.410 --> 00:57:48.730
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1408
00:57:48.730 --> 00:57:53.730
<v Speaker 1>So what he would do is he talk to the crowd and then he listened.</v>

1409
00:57:55.030 --> 00:58:00.030
<v Speaker 1>I've never said anything but the angry crowd was excited about that.</v>

1410
00:58:01.541 --> 00:58:06.541
<v Speaker 1>He kept that and sort of became a master app telling the angry crowd what they</v>

1411
00:58:07.811 --> 00:58:08.710
<v Speaker 1>wanted to hear.</v>

1412
00:58:08.970 --> 00:58:12.170
<v Speaker 1>What that meant in some sense was that he allowed the product,</v>

1413
00:58:12.210 --> 00:58:13.150
<v Speaker 1>produced him.</v>

1414
00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:16.660
<v Speaker 1>And the thing about an angry crowd is that an angry crowd,</v>

1415
00:58:16.661 --> 00:58:20.680
<v Speaker 1>he's made it individually so I can block your right when you're right,</v>

1416
00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:24.550
<v Speaker 1>you're right and you're not reading individually because not be held accountable</v>

1417
00:58:24.551 --> 00:58:25.384
<v Speaker 1>for your actions.</v>

1418
00:58:25.630 --> 00:58:26.710
<v Speaker 1>You can hide your path,</v>

1419
00:58:26.711 --> 00:58:31.410
<v Speaker 1>log into the group and some of your addressing on Bob and you want to rob you.</v>

1420
00:58:31.450 --> 00:58:34.800
<v Speaker 1>Then you have to tell the paintings wants to hear me.</v>

1421
00:58:34.810 --> 00:58:37.470
<v Speaker 1>Maybe if you do that for five years and you're really good at it,</v>

1422
00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:40.570
<v Speaker 1>you get it to be an absolute expert and telling me a remark what it wants to</v>

1423
00:58:40.571 --> 00:58:41.290
<v Speaker 1>hear,</v>

1424
00:58:41.290 --> 00:58:42.710
<v Speaker 1>and then maybe that's how Hitler,</v>

1425
00:58:42.820 --> 00:58:44.920
<v Speaker 1>the German people created each other.</v>

1426
00:58:45.470 --> 00:58:46.000
<v Speaker 1>Unextended.</v>

1427
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:47.680
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's participated in that.</v>

1428
00:58:47.681 --> 00:58:52.300
<v Speaker 1>It's not Hitler who somehow genius benches that does this all by itself.</v>

1429
00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:57.460
<v Speaker 1>It's the bitterness and resentment of badly lived rights that manifested itself</v>

1430
00:58:57.461 --> 00:58:59.530
<v Speaker 1>in the desire for a totalitarian leader,</v>

1431
00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:03.970
<v Speaker 1>finds a scapegoat that can be tortured and tormented so that everybody could get</v>

1432
00:59:03.971 --> 00:59:04.541
<v Speaker 1>the revenge.</v>

1433
00:59:04.541 --> 00:59:05.680
<v Speaker 1>He gets gone.</v>

1434
00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:07.780
<v Speaker 1>That's essentially the proposition.</v>

1435
00:59:09.790 --> 00:59:14.790
<v Speaker 1>Thank people can do terrible things intently in rule sets.</v>

1436
00:59:21.430 --> 00:59:22.740
<v Speaker 1>So now says</v>

1437
00:59:28.120 --> 00:59:32.840
<v Speaker 1>saying it's the perfect order before you criticize the world and it's a good</v>

1438
00:59:32.841 --> 00:59:35.390
<v Speaker 1>rule to talk about tonight because of what happened in Toronto.</v>

1439
00:59:35.391 --> 00:59:36.280
<v Speaker 1>So recently,</v>

1440
00:59:36.580 --> 00:59:38.300
<v Speaker 1>you know that I'm ready.</v>

1441
00:59:38.310 --> 00:59:39.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if this is correct.</v>

1442
00:59:39.890 --> 00:59:42.190
<v Speaker 1>Even if it is technically correct,</v>

1443
00:59:42.191 --> 00:59:43.370
<v Speaker 1>this metaphysical correct.</v>

1444
00:59:43.371 --> 00:59:44.660
<v Speaker 1>So it will give a of the trick,</v>

1445
00:59:45.140 --> 00:59:46.250
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>

1446
00:59:46.251 --> 00:59:48.970
<v Speaker 1>if I control that back and drove it for 12 blocks,</v>

1447
00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:50.240
<v Speaker 1>is that.</v>

1448
00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:51.073
<v Speaker 1>Is that correct?</v>

1449
00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:51.891
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1450
00:59:51.891 --> 00:59:55.250
<v Speaker 1>Now you to think about that even though you don't want to because who wants to</v>

1451
00:59:55.251 --> 00:59:56.150
<v Speaker 1>think about that?</v>

1452
00:59:57.500 --> 01:00:02.080
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're unstable and angry and see rick and now I'm going to see when</v>

1453
01:00:02.090 --> 01:00:02.960
<v Speaker 1>you're bitter,</v>

1454
01:00:03.050 --> 01:00:05.630
<v Speaker 1>you're driving your van and there was a crowd of people and you think,</v>

1455
01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:06.021
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1456
01:00:06.021 --> 01:00:06.721
<v Speaker 1>to hell with it.</v>

1457
01:00:06.721 --> 01:00:10.430
<v Speaker 1>And you step on the gas and the mold out of three people right in and that's</v>

1458
01:00:10.431 --> 01:00:11.264
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1459
01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:11.870
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1460
01:00:11.870 --> 01:00:12.490
<v Speaker 1>Less.</v>

1461
01:00:12.490 --> 01:00:15.230
<v Speaker 1>You have to be in a pretty damn dark place to do that,</v>

1462
01:00:15.830 --> 01:00:18.740
<v Speaker 1>but that is anything compared to the place that you're in.</v>

1463
01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:22.940
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to drive on the sidewalk for 12 blocks and you're going to take</v>

1464
01:00:22.941 --> 01:00:24.940
<v Speaker 1>people off one by one,</v>

1465
01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:29.210
<v Speaker 1>knowing full well what you're doing and what in reveling in it.</v>

1466
01:00:29.690 --> 01:00:33.340
<v Speaker 1>I've heard it reported the next day he called me up to talk about this.</v>

1467
01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:37.370
<v Speaker 1>She said she watched the young man who perpetrated this massacre,</v>

1468
01:00:37.530 --> 01:00:38.480
<v Speaker 1>walked into the clock,</v>

1469
01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:42.410
<v Speaker 1>into the courtroom and she said it looked like he was there to receive an award</v>

1470
01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:46.580
<v Speaker 1>and so that's something else that has to be factored in and we don't like to</v>

1471
01:00:46.581 --> 01:00:47.660
<v Speaker 1>think about these things.</v>

1472
01:00:47.661 --> 01:00:48.260
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1473
01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:48.531
<v Speaker 1>we don't,</v>

1474
01:00:48.531 --> 01:00:52.590
<v Speaker 1>we don't like because we might to think even maybe that the person was oppressed</v>

1475
01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:56.750
<v Speaker 1>to the predictive buys two subsets and that's why they turn and take what</v>

1476
01:00:56.751 --> 01:00:57.170
<v Speaker 1>beginners.</v>

1477
01:00:57.170 --> 01:01:01.670
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of old press people and very few of them take a 12 blocks and take</v>

1478
01:01:01.671 --> 01:01:03.380
<v Speaker 1>out the Mrs. April and then I knew,</v>

1479
01:01:03.381 --> 01:01:04.670
<v Speaker 1>we hear well he hated women.</v>

1480
01:01:04.671 --> 01:01:04.971
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1481
01:01:04.971 --> 01:01:06.320
<v Speaker 1>why you didn't just kill women.</v>

1482
01:01:06.850 --> 01:01:09.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean certainly getting killed mentor that had rejected him.</v>

1483
01:01:09.890 --> 01:01:14.200
<v Speaker 1>This was something far deeper and far darker and it's a cannon to certain</v>

1484
01:01:14.210 --> 01:01:16.670
<v Speaker 1>situation that can actually only be contemplated,</v>

1485
01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:19.490
<v Speaker 1>can only be understood using something like theological language,</v>

1486
01:01:19.491 --> 01:01:22.880
<v Speaker 1>which is why I think theological language actually exists because there are</v>

1487
01:01:22.881 --> 01:01:27.320
<v Speaker 1>things that are so terrible that there's no way you can understand them unless</v>

1488
01:01:27.321 --> 01:01:28.910
<v Speaker 1>you use the white ones with good and evil.</v>

1489
01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:32.480
<v Speaker 1>You're just not even anything in the right domain.</v>

1490
01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:37.670
<v Speaker 1>You have no idea where you have to go in your fantasies to months and months and</v>

1491
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:41.630
<v Speaker 1>months until you start thinking of renting a van and drive it down the sidewalk</v>

1492
01:01:41.690 --> 01:01:45.470
<v Speaker 1>for 12 blocks and taking out into some people is exactly what you should be</v>

1493
01:01:45.471 --> 01:01:46.640
<v Speaker 1>doing that day.</v>

1494
01:01:46.850 --> 01:01:48.240
<v Speaker 1>That's no wind band.</v>

1495
01:01:48.650 --> 01:01:53.270
<v Speaker 1>You've got some pretty damn dark places before you get there and God only knows</v>

1496
01:01:53.271 --> 01:01:55.130
<v Speaker 1>what you need to those dark places.</v>

1497
01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:57.800
<v Speaker 1>It's the same with high school shooters.</v>

1498
01:01:57.890 --> 01:02:02.890
<v Speaker 1>These people plan and dream and fantasize about the destruction that are going</v>

1499
01:02:03.291 --> 01:02:06.380
<v Speaker 1>to wreak right then and there and they're doing it.</v>

1500
01:02:06.530 --> 01:02:07.190
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>

1501
01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:07.500
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

1502
01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:07.621
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1503
01:02:07.621 --> 01:02:08.570
<v Speaker 1>why are they doing it?</v>

1504
01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:12.210
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's a mystery that the columbine kids that come from,</v>

1505
01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:15.290
<v Speaker 1>I remember correctly often for high school shooters killed themselves.</v>

1506
01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:17.540
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what happened with the columbine kids.</v>

1507
01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:19.453
<v Speaker 1>You might.</v>

1508
01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:21.420
<v Speaker 1>Why in the world when you go home,</v>

1509
01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:25.410
<v Speaker 1>the trouble when you say it was a hopeless thing,</v>

1510
01:02:25.411 --> 01:02:28.830
<v Speaker 1>you're suicidal and people get that way and you think,</v>

1511
01:02:28.831 --> 01:02:29.101
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1512
01:02:29.101 --> 01:02:30.180
<v Speaker 1>well you're so hopeless.</v>

1513
01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:31.830
<v Speaker 1>Maybe your bitterly resentful.</v>

1514
01:02:32.010 --> 01:02:34.020
<v Speaker 1>Wife has dealt bad cards.</v>

1515
01:02:34.090 --> 01:02:35.060
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it really has.</v>

1516
01:02:35.070 --> 01:02:35.760
<v Speaker 1>If you think,</v>

1517
01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:37.290
<v Speaker 1>I just can't stand this anymore,</v>

1518
01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:40.530
<v Speaker 1>you go down into the base took and you know you put a pistol under your hand,</v>

1519
01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:47.070
<v Speaker 1>but that's a whole different thing that going to to the school and shoot up a</v>

1520
01:02:47.071 --> 01:02:50.580
<v Speaker 1>bunch of people and authentic killing yourself because it's.</v>

1521
01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:53.760
<v Speaker 1>I call why bother with the whole murder?</v>

1522
01:02:54.330 --> 01:02:54.991
<v Speaker 1>What's the point?</v>

1523
01:02:54.991 --> 01:02:55.824
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1524
01:02:56.310 --> 01:02:58.020
<v Speaker 1>You know you're not there anymore.</v>

1525
01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:00.180
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you just do the world a favor so to speak,</v>

1526
01:03:00.181 --> 01:03:02.130
<v Speaker 1>and I skipped the first part.</v>

1527
01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:06.300
<v Speaker 1>The second part is the thing that you should be pursuing or you're trying to</v>

1528
01:03:06.301 --> 01:03:09.970
<v Speaker 1>make a point in trying to make some kind of point here.</v>

1529
01:03:09.971 --> 01:03:10.860
<v Speaker 1>Aiming at something.</v>

1530
01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:11.670
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1531
01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:14.340
<v Speaker 1>You never know what you're trying to make an appointment because they would give</v>

1532
01:03:14.341 --> 01:03:17.580
<v Speaker 1>you 100 million dollars for the free publicity the next day.</v>

1533
01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:21.030
<v Speaker 1>If you to effectively make your point on what's your point.</v>

1534
01:03:21.031 --> 01:03:21.864
<v Speaker 1>Exactly,</v>

1535
01:03:22.590 --> 01:03:25.050
<v Speaker 1>exactly what's exactly your point.</v>

1536
01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:28.740
<v Speaker 1>Why are you killing innocent people who like kicking?</v>

1537
01:03:28.750 --> 01:03:32.340
<v Speaker 1>The guy went into the elementary school in Connecticut and shot elementary</v>

1538
01:03:32.341 --> 01:03:33.270
<v Speaker 1>school kids.</v>

1539
01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:34.111
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>

1540
01:03:34.111 --> 01:03:34.321
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1541
01:03:34.321 --> 01:03:35.690
<v Speaker 1>why would you go back through them?</v>

1542
01:03:35.710 --> 01:03:36.543
<v Speaker 1>They're so innocent.</v>

1543
01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:37.110
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1544
01:03:37.110 --> 01:03:37.531
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1545
01:03:37.531 --> 01:03:38.490
<v Speaker 1>you don't get it.</v>

1546
01:03:39.350 --> 01:03:40.620
<v Speaker 1>That's why you go ask.</v>

1547
01:03:41.310 --> 01:03:42.930
<v Speaker 1>I felt that a mystery.</v>

1548
01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:44.550
<v Speaker 1>That's the reason.</v>

1549
01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:47.100
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to extract revenge,</v>

1550
01:03:47.130 --> 01:03:48.870
<v Speaker 1>why don't we go after the guilty?</v>

1551
01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:50.760
<v Speaker 1>They deserve it.</v>

1552
01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:53.250
<v Speaker 1>If you're really after revenge,</v>

1553
01:03:53.550 --> 01:03:58.390
<v Speaker 1>you go after the answer because it's more vengeful to punish the innocent.</v>

1554
01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.910
<v Speaker 1>That is to publish with guilty and then you might ask,</v>

1555
01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:01.081
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1556
01:04:01.081 --> 01:04:02.100
<v Speaker 1>why don't you want to punish?</v>

1557
01:04:02.101 --> 01:04:04.140
<v Speaker 1>The innocent told us</v>

1558
01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:12.320
<v Speaker 1>is because your bitterness knows no bonds is because you set yourself up as the</v>

1559
01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:16.290
<v Speaker 1>judge of existence.</v>

1560
01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:21.500
<v Speaker 1>The judge of being itself and the founding of wanting in your estimation of your</v>

1561
01:04:23.241 --> 01:04:27.230
<v Speaker 1>own for revenge as a consequence and the best way to conceptualize it.</v>

1562
01:04:27.690 --> 01:04:30.060
<v Speaker 1>It's revenge against God and you think,</v>

1563
01:04:30.090 --> 01:04:30.271
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1564
01:04:30.271 --> 01:04:35.271
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe when you are in a situation like the one we're describing what</v>

1565
01:04:37.321 --> 01:04:41.790
<v Speaker 1>you think you believe has almost no bearing on the situation at all.</v>

1566
01:04:42.350 --> 01:04:47.250
<v Speaker 1>You're acting on eternal little drama and it's contract with a person who shoots</v>

1567
01:04:47.251 --> 01:04:52.251
<v Speaker 1>his fist at the sky and says how comfortable beating of this nature possibly be</v>

1568
01:04:52.771 --> 01:04:53.820
<v Speaker 1>constituted.</v>

1569
01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:58.140
<v Speaker 1>Everything should suffer for the outrage of its existence and I'm just the</v>

1570
01:04:58.141 --> 01:05:02.490
<v Speaker 1>person to make it suffer and that's where we go with you want to shoot up the</v>

1571
01:05:02.491 --> 01:05:06.450
<v Speaker 1>high school and there's darker places than that to have no one wants to</v>

1572
01:05:06.451 --> 01:05:07.980
<v Speaker 1>understand that because of the park,</v>

1573
01:05:07.981 --> 01:05:10.050
<v Speaker 1>because that's a bit too close to the ball,</v>

1574
01:05:10.110 --> 01:05:11.400
<v Speaker 1>but also partly because it's.</v>

1575
01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:14.370
<v Speaker 1>It's a very terrible place to revenge unoccupied.</v>

1576
01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:16.910
<v Speaker 1>You'd kind of don't understand those.</v>

1577
01:05:17.470 --> 01:05:22.470
<v Speaker 1>You're willing to take yourself and to see the association would be people who</v>

1578
01:05:23.711 --> 01:05:27.280
<v Speaker 1>do not start at the darkest corners of your own psyche.</v>

1579
01:05:28.150 --> 01:05:28.983
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

1580
01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:33.010
<v Speaker 1>People had an unbelievable capacity for some people,</v>

1581
01:05:33.011 --> 01:05:37.000
<v Speaker 1>that's all of us and it comes out with all sorts of ways and most of us are</v>

1582
01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:41.800
<v Speaker 1>fortunate enough or well controlled enough or lucky enough or good enough not to</v>

1583
01:05:41.801 --> 01:05:46.360
<v Speaker 1>hold those terribly dark places because we're not capable of doing it and it</v>

1584
01:05:46.361 --> 01:05:49.750
<v Speaker 1>certainly the that could lead sound around us constantly.</v>

1585
01:05:54.730 --> 01:05:56.790
<v Speaker 1>So what's the alternative to that?</v>

1586
01:05:57.650 --> 01:05:59.560
<v Speaker 1>The guy did this apparently.</v>

1587
01:05:59.870 --> 01:06:01.910
<v Speaker 1>Was it in of I guess idea.</v>

1588
01:06:01.930 --> 01:06:05.770
<v Speaker 1>He was rejected by rejected by women.</v>

1589
01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:07.220
<v Speaker 1>I got him for man.</v>

1590
01:06:07.221 --> 01:06:08.380
<v Speaker 1>Generally speaking,</v>

1591
01:06:08.650 --> 01:06:10.420
<v Speaker 1>if all you've ever approached you,</v>

1592
01:06:10.421 --> 01:06:13.150
<v Speaker 1>do you have to do is ask him something wrong with you,</v>

1593
01:06:21.830 --> 01:06:22.663
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1594
01:06:24.410 --> 01:06:29.410
<v Speaker 1>If you're trying to jury of your peers and they find wanting is always the</v>

1595
01:06:30.921 --> 01:06:35.390
<v Speaker 1>possibility that you're just not quite up to scratch and then you might think,</v>

1596
01:06:35.391 --> 01:06:35.990
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1597
01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:37.520
<v Speaker 1>what should you do about that?</v>

1598
01:06:37.610 --> 01:06:37.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1599
01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:38.350
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

1600
01:06:38.350 --> 01:06:39.183
<v Speaker 1>You might think,</v>

1601
01:06:39.370 --> 01:06:39.740
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1602
01:06:39.740 --> 01:06:42.530
<v Speaker 1>there is some good grounds for revenge,</v>

1603
01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:43.070
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1604
01:06:43.070 --> 01:06:47.150
<v Speaker 1>I could refile half of the human race because they rejected me,</v>

1605
01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:48.590
<v Speaker 1>or the alternative is,</v>

1606
01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:49.070
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1607
01:06:49.070 --> 01:06:53.240
<v Speaker 1>maybe you might think about something about yourself that could be improved and</v>

1608
01:06:54.210 --> 01:06:59.180
<v Speaker 1>that's daunting obviously because if you have to accept that value that the</v>

1609
01:06:59.181 --> 01:07:03.520
<v Speaker 1>reason you're being rejected is that the reasons you're being rejected or coffee</v>

1610
01:07:03.530 --> 01:07:06.590
<v Speaker 1>pretty damn d and that's a bitter pill to swallow,</v>

1611
01:07:06.591 --> 01:07:08.750
<v Speaker 1>but what's the alternative?</v>

1612
01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:10.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1613
01:07:10.130 --> 01:07:11.290
<v Speaker 1>the alternative is if you.</v>

1614
01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:12.221
<v Speaker 1>It's failure,</v>

1615
01:07:12.221 --> 01:07:13.230
<v Speaker 1>it's abject failure.</v>

1616
01:07:13.231 --> 01:07:18.050
<v Speaker 1>You're constant existence to misery and resentment and brief and that just keeps</v>

1617
01:07:18.051 --> 01:07:18.831
<v Speaker 1>the ball rolling.</v>

1618
01:07:18.831 --> 01:07:19.370
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

1619
01:07:19.370 --> 01:07:23.060
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate endpoint of that kind of thought process is exactly what happened</v>

1620
01:07:23.061 --> 01:07:23.894
<v Speaker 1>in Toronto.</v>

1621
01:07:24.370 --> 01:07:28.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to have the courage to face the unknown because people are always</v>

1622
01:07:28.611 --> 01:07:29.960
<v Speaker 1>telling you what's wrong with you.</v>

1623
01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:33.980
<v Speaker 1>If you listen because everyone else is everyone else in homes that they can be</v>

1624
01:07:33.981 --> 01:07:37.040
<v Speaker 1>more than they are because everywhere you go you think,</v>

1625
01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:37.971
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't it be better?</v>

1626
01:07:37.971 --> 01:07:41.280
<v Speaker 1>Would it be good if I met someone who was born and they are and they're</v>

1627
01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:42.620
<v Speaker 1>disappointed when someone isn't.</v>

1628
01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:45.080
<v Speaker 1>Be Interesting to talk to her when they're jokes aren't funny or what?</v>

1629
01:07:45.090 --> 01:07:46.880
<v Speaker 1>They don't have anything intelligent to say.</v>

1630
01:07:47.150 --> 01:07:49.400
<v Speaker 1>What would they be turning a little bit cooperative.</v>

1631
01:07:49.401 --> 01:07:50.380
<v Speaker 1>You can't trust them.</v>

1632
01:07:50.540 --> 01:07:55.540
<v Speaker 1>You're deeply disappointing to me because he couldn't be and so take as long as</v>

1633
01:07:56.870 --> 01:08:00.050
<v Speaker 1>you pay attention to what people are talking and then they'll tell you what</v>

1634
01:08:00.170 --> 01:08:02.090
<v Speaker 1>about you and then if you listed the back,</v>

1635
01:08:02.270 --> 01:08:06.770
<v Speaker 1>you can start to fix what's not good about you and he'll be somewhat better and</v>

1636
01:08:06.771 --> 01:08:11.771
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot better than taking the murderous route to resentment and full you</v>

1637
01:08:13.310 --> 01:08:13.640
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

1638
01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:16.910
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I really admire the Old Testament Hebrews,</v>

1639
01:08:16.911 --> 01:08:18.800
<v Speaker 1>it's quite a remarkable thing.</v>

1640
01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:21.860
<v Speaker 1>I think this is one of the things that gives the biblical stories.</v>

1641
01:08:21.861 --> 01:08:23.150
<v Speaker 1>They're immense.</v>

1642
01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:28.580
<v Speaker 1>Archetypical power is flat so that all the time their societies fall apart</v>

1643
01:08:28.610 --> 01:08:30.530
<v Speaker 1>because they get very harsh wives,</v>

1644
01:08:30.770 --> 01:08:32.060
<v Speaker 1>very punished lives,</v>

1645
01:08:32.270 --> 01:08:33.620
<v Speaker 1>and often you know what they've done,</v>

1646
01:08:33.621 --> 01:08:36.830
<v Speaker 1>the things that would enable them to preserve that sort of faith,</v>

1647
01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:42.160
<v Speaker 1>but the point is is that the old testament is a rather brutal book and there's</v>

1648
01:08:43.310 --> 01:08:46.460
<v Speaker 1>no shortage of multigenerational failure,</v>

1649
01:08:46.850 --> 01:08:51.850
<v Speaker 1>but the one thing that he was constantly refuse to do is to reject the idea that</v>

1650
01:08:52.011 --> 01:08:56.210
<v Speaker 1>the structure of existence is five positive.</v>

1651
01:08:57.230 --> 01:08:58.580
<v Speaker 1>When they come to their senses,</v>

1652
01:08:58.581 --> 01:09:03.320
<v Speaker 1>they always think the reason that things are impossible for us is because we're</v>

1653
01:09:03.321 --> 01:09:07.490
<v Speaker 1>not able to think we could be and that's very much more,</v>

1654
01:09:08.660 --> 01:09:09.650
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>

1655
01:09:09.710 --> 01:09:12.050
<v Speaker 1>Productive Line of meditation,</v>

1656
01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:14.110
<v Speaker 1>and it's also much more optimistic.</v>

1657
01:09:14.130 --> 01:09:14.390
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

1658
01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:18.320
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I've really been struck about while talking to so many people</v>

1659
01:09:18.321 --> 01:09:19.154
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>

1660
01:09:19.370 --> 01:09:20.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1661
01:09:20.150 --> 01:09:25.150
<v Speaker 1>for 30 or 40 years we've had this idea that it's being promoted by psychologist,</v>

1662
01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:30.990
<v Speaker 1>the luxury good ones that you should feel good about yourself and should have</v>

1663
01:09:32.090 --> 01:09:33.140
<v Speaker 1>some self esteem.</v>

1664
01:09:33.141 --> 01:09:34.280
<v Speaker 1>You should feel good about yourself.</v>

1665
01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:36.200
<v Speaker 1>I think that's complete rubbish.</v>

1666
01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:40.100
<v Speaker 1>I also think that people don't know that that's rubbish and then it's actually a</v>

1667
01:09:40.101 --> 01:09:45.020
<v Speaker 1>really pessimistic thing to tell people because most people are not.</v>

1668
01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:46.153
<v Speaker 1>Not everyone.</v>

1669
01:09:46.310 --> 01:09:51.310
<v Speaker 1>Many people are not satisfied until they are or what their likes are and it's</v>

1670
01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:55.730
<v Speaker 1>painful and maybe it's because they're too judgmental about themselves to harm</v>

1671
01:09:55.790 --> 01:09:56.180
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

1672
01:09:56.180 --> 01:09:57.013
<v Speaker 1>That happens,</v>

1673
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:59.960
<v Speaker 1>but it's over because they know perfectly well that they're doing everything</v>

1674
01:09:59.961 --> 01:10:04.280
<v Speaker 1>they could be and IPO that they could be beckons and an ideal as a judge.</v>

1675
01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:05.180
<v Speaker 1>At the same time.</v>

1676
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:07.070
<v Speaker 1>One of the most brilliant things I've ever read.</v>

1677
01:10:07.071 --> 01:10:07.820
<v Speaker 1>This was quite fertile.</v>

1678
01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:08.360
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1679
01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:12.290
<v Speaker 1>he was very interested in why the book of revelation was appended to the end of</v>

1680
01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:16.590
<v Speaker 1>the new testament because it's this weird hallucinogenic psilocybin mushroom</v>

1681
01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:17.190
<v Speaker 1>trip.</v>

1682
01:10:17.190 --> 01:10:18.023
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1683
01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:19.340
<v Speaker 1>it's a crazy,</v>

1684
01:10:19.341 --> 01:10:24.341
<v Speaker 1>crazy book full of this saying it's saying imagery and in that book,</v>

1685
01:10:24.610 --> 01:10:28.250
<v Speaker 1>Christ comes back as the judge with a sword coming on this device.</v>

1686
01:10:28.830 --> 01:10:32.270
<v Speaker 1>People into the damp and the elected her not her many elect.</v>

1687
01:10:32.290 --> 01:10:32.900
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1688
01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:35.660
<v Speaker 1>as a hell of a thing for a failure of mercy to do.</v>

1689
01:10:36.290 --> 01:10:39.920
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things you have pointed out was that an ideal is always a judge</v>

1690
01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:44.020
<v Speaker 1>and are something that really struck me when I first read it because I thought,</v>

1691
01:10:44.021 --> 01:10:44.111
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1692
01:10:44.111 --> 01:10:45.250
<v Speaker 1>of course that's the case.</v>

1693
01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:46.580
<v Speaker 1>If you put something,</v>

1694
01:10:46.670 --> 01:10:48.890
<v Speaker 1>if you deposit stuff has nothing to do with,</v>

1695
01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:49.530
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

1696
01:10:49.530 --> 01:10:50.530
<v Speaker 1>with with the.</v>

1697
01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:52.670
<v Speaker 1>This is a psychological statement.</v>

1698
01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:54.620
<v Speaker 1>If you positive an ideal,</v>

1699
01:10:54.710 --> 01:10:55.470
<v Speaker 1>if your idea,</v>

1700
01:10:55.470 --> 01:10:58.910
<v Speaker 1>if you imagine who you could be if you were saying that you could make,</v>

1701
01:10:59.260 --> 01:10:59.600
<v Speaker 1>I'd say,</v>

1702
01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:03.380
<v Speaker 1>and that sort of starts to shade it to the idea of the mythological hero.</v>

1703
01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:06.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean that starts to shape me into the idea of the Messiah and the Savior.</v>

1704
01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:09.730
<v Speaker 1>You start to imagine everything that could be that you're not.</v>

1705
01:11:09.770 --> 01:11:13.410
<v Speaker 1>That's a terrible judge and that's why that image is up.</v>

1706
01:11:13.470 --> 01:11:18.470
<v Speaker 1>The empathy that series of books is because even if the ideal is all merciful,</v>

1707
01:11:18.790 --> 01:11:22.260
<v Speaker 1>just probably say how Christ is presented in the new testament the judge has</v>

1708
01:11:22.261 --> 01:11:26.820
<v Speaker 1>missing and something that's perfect as a judge and that we would come back.</v>

1709
01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.010
<v Speaker 1>And so that was extraordinarily useful,</v>

1710
01:11:29.070 --> 01:11:30.030
<v Speaker 1>but it also.</v>

1711
01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:30.913
<v Speaker 1>But he didn't let it take.</v>

1712
01:11:30.990 --> 01:11:34.690
<v Speaker 1>It's an indication to have the price he paid for participating in the value</v>

1713
01:11:35.140 --> 01:11:36.030
<v Speaker 1>because we can pause,</v>

1714
01:11:36.110 --> 01:11:37.200
<v Speaker 1>we could be.</v>

1715
01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:40.530
<v Speaker 1>Then you're instantly ashamed in front of your own ideal,</v>

1716
01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:42.330
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's appropriate.</v>

1717
01:11:42.450 --> 01:11:43.890
<v Speaker 1>I think that's exactly right.</v>

1718
01:11:43.980 --> 01:11:47.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean that people should crush themselves with guilt because I don't</v>

1719
01:11:47.491 --> 01:11:48.870
<v Speaker 1>think that's constructive,</v>

1720
01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:53.280
<v Speaker 1>but if you think you have a child that you turned to foster,</v>

1721
01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:55.770
<v Speaker 1>you don't tell the child everything they could be.</v>

1722
01:11:56.250 --> 01:11:57.090
<v Speaker 1>You don't ever do that.</v>

1723
01:11:57.091 --> 01:11:57.400
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

1724
01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:59.370
<v Speaker 1>look like you're on the right path,</v>

1725
01:11:59.400 --> 01:11:59.880
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1726
01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:01.410
<v Speaker 1>You're developing your.</v>

1727
01:12:01.470 --> 01:12:05.250
<v Speaker 1>You encourage them to expand themselves into the world and then say,</v>

1728
01:12:05.251 --> 01:12:05.760
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1729
01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:07.390
<v Speaker 1>you're not gonna compare to one.</v>

1730
01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:08.250
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be,</v>

1731
01:12:08.650 --> 01:12:10.200
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to be so great?</v>

1732
01:12:10.590 --> 01:12:11.450
<v Speaker 1>It's so great.</v>

1733
01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:13.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm lucky half laying in front of him dead.</v>

1734
01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:16.680
<v Speaker 1>The fact that you're insufficient in relationship to that is fine and then you</v>

1735
01:12:16.681 --> 01:12:20.940
<v Speaker 1>give them a destiny in the pathway and one of the things that struck me so much</v>

1736
01:12:21.210 --> 01:12:25.590
<v Speaker 1>since I've been talking to groups of about this size is how how captivated</v>

1737
01:12:25.591 --> 01:12:28.770
<v Speaker 1>people are by that idea because they actually don't want to be told,</v>

1738
01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:29.071
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1739
01:12:29.071 --> 01:12:30.090
<v Speaker 1>you're okay the way you are,</v>

1740
01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:32.030
<v Speaker 1>so I'm probably going to do go home and you know,</v>

1741
01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:32.750
<v Speaker 1>be in your film,</v>

1742
01:12:32.750 --> 01:12:37.310
<v Speaker 1>the bedroom and eventually your the bed in box with bitter and depressed and</v>

1743
01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:39.420
<v Speaker 1>take more self esteem.</v>

1744
01:12:41.870 --> 01:12:46.870
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

1745
01:12:53.010 --> 01:12:57.380
<v Speaker 1>Start with small things and not an works even starting permanently.</v>

1746
01:12:57.410 --> 01:12:57.990
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1747
01:12:57.990 --> 01:13:00.120
<v Speaker 1>so it's chapter four,</v>

1748
01:13:00.390 --> 01:13:03.420
<v Speaker 1>which is a chapter above the alternative.</v>

1749
01:13:03.430 --> 01:13:04.231
<v Speaker 1>DMV says,</v>

1750
01:13:04.231 --> 01:13:07.200
<v Speaker 1>you should prepare yourself and who you were yesterday instead of who someone</v>

1751
01:13:07.201 --> 01:13:08.280
<v Speaker 1>else's today.</v>

1752
01:13:08.460 --> 01:13:08.731
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1753
01:13:08.731 --> 01:13:08.851
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1754
01:13:08.851 --> 01:13:10.320
<v Speaker 1>who knows what your destiny is?</v>

1755
01:13:10.321 --> 01:13:11.010
<v Speaker 1>The onset.</v>

1756
01:13:11.010 --> 01:13:14.550
<v Speaker 1>It's a problem to comparing yourself to other people who are successful because</v>

1757
01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:18.000
<v Speaker 1>those other people aren't you and you're a peculiar thing.</v>

1758
01:13:18.150 --> 01:13:23.150
<v Speaker 1>I get a singular thing and what's good for you in the truest sense is going to</v>

1759
01:13:24.181 --> 01:13:27.420
<v Speaker 1>be in the category of what's good for other people,</v>

1760
01:13:27.421 --> 01:13:30.930
<v Speaker 1>but it's going to be an idiosyncratic mortgage and circle.</v>

1761
01:13:31.230 --> 01:13:32.640
<v Speaker 1>If you're going everything you could be,</v>

1762
01:13:32.641 --> 01:13:36.330
<v Speaker 1>you can be bitter about that because other people have more often the delusion</v>

1763
01:13:36.380 --> 01:13:36.781
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>

1764
01:13:36.781 --> 01:13:38.010
<v Speaker 1>although not always,</v>

1765
01:13:38.190 --> 01:13:40.230
<v Speaker 1>but you can get a tremendous way.</v>

1766
01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:42.480
<v Speaker 1>You can get a tremendous distance by thinking,</v>

1767
01:13:42.481 --> 01:13:42.781
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1768
01:13:42.781 --> 01:13:43.440
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1769
01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:44.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1770
01:13:44.070 --> 01:13:48.090
<v Speaker 1>here I am and here's a bunch of things that I know I'm doing wrong.</v>

1771
01:13:48.110 --> 01:13:50.850
<v Speaker 1>There is a good thing to think about that slight confession.</v>

1772
01:13:50.851 --> 01:13:53.130
<v Speaker 1>That's what the Catholics were trying to do.</v>

1773
01:13:53.250 --> 01:13:54.330
<v Speaker 1>You know it's brilliant.</v>

1774
01:13:54.331 --> 01:13:55.400
<v Speaker 1>We've lost that idea.</v>

1775
01:13:55.401 --> 01:14:00.401
<v Speaker 1>Ideas go somewhere once a week and tell someone why you're pathetic and</v>

1776
01:14:02.450 --> 01:14:03.283
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1777
01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:07.200
<v Speaker 1>it's not something that you think that you're pathetic and useless and so that</v>

1778
01:14:07.201 --> 01:14:11.070
<v Speaker 1>you can get one isn't so good about you right here in front of you</v>

1779
01:14:13.590 --> 01:14:14.423
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

1780
01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:19.370
<v Speaker 1>me and Brian and you know now otherwise empty.</v>

1781
01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:21.090
<v Speaker 1>You could have killed me.</v>

1782
01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:26.390
<v Speaker 1>Them some possibility that I could take attendance step towards setting in a</v>

1783
01:14:27.340 --> 01:14:27.610
<v Speaker 1>second.</v>

1784
01:14:27.610 --> 01:14:29.050
<v Speaker 1>That's a tome I'm right.</v>

1785
01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:30.430
<v Speaker 1>That's redemption,</v>

1786
01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:31.761
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1787
01:14:31.761 --> 01:14:32.290
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1788
01:14:32.290 --> 01:14:37.000
<v Speaker 1>that's the recreation of your spirit and the resurrection of your relationship</v>

1789
01:14:37.001 --> 01:14:39.520
<v Speaker 1>with divinity that it's part of,</v>

1790
01:14:39.521 --> 01:14:40.271
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1791
01:14:40.271 --> 01:14:40.610
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

1792
01:14:40.610 --> 01:14:41.590
<v Speaker 1>What that is.</v>

1793
01:14:41.710 --> 01:14:45.400
<v Speaker 1>It's the right way you're thinking about and you can get there by admission on</v>

1794
01:14:45.401 --> 01:14:49.530
<v Speaker 1>the hour and that's why humility is one of the fundamental religious virtues.</v>

1795
01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:52.330
<v Speaker 1>It took me a long time to figure that out because humility,</v>

1796
01:14:52.331 --> 01:14:55.730
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like such a wretched and pathetic virtual learning.</v>

1797
01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:56.590
<v Speaker 1>So humble.</v>

1798
01:14:56.680 --> 01:14:57.513
<v Speaker 1>It's like</v>

1799
01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:00.830
<v Speaker 1>that's my narratives but.</v>

1800
01:15:01.090 --> 01:15:02.480
<v Speaker 1>But that isn't it.</v>

1801
01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:03.990
<v Speaker 1>Like the humility is,</v>

1802
01:15:03.991 --> 01:15:08.991
<v Speaker 1>is that there's things you don't know and they're really important and you</v>

1803
01:15:09.250 --> 01:15:11.680
<v Speaker 1>should be doing is opening yourself up and thinking bad.</v>

1804
01:15:11.830 --> 01:15:16.830
<v Speaker 1>There was no learning is going to strip me as soon as strip me of all my bad</v>

1805
01:15:16.871 --> 01:15:17.231
<v Speaker 1>habits.</v>

1806
01:15:17.231 --> 01:15:17.410
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1807
01:15:17.410 --> 01:15:20.350
<v Speaker 1>My debt would it be like passing through a fire,</v>

1808
01:15:20.410 --> 01:15:21.910
<v Speaker 1>but I'm open to it as well.</v>

1809
01:15:21.911 --> 01:15:24.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm always locate to see what I don't know.</v>

1810
01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:25.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm always looking to see what's wrong with me.</v>

1811
01:15:25.991 --> 01:15:26.801
<v Speaker 1>That can be set,</v>

1812
01:15:26.801 --> 01:15:27.634
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1813
01:15:27.670 --> 01:15:27.821
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1814
01:15:27.821 --> 01:15:32.110
<v Speaker 1>that's humility and you know there's a lot more that you don't know that,</v>

1815
01:15:32.111 --> 01:15:34.680
<v Speaker 1>that you do know and you might also ask your questions,</v>

1816
01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:35.470
<v Speaker 1>ask yourself,</v>

1817
01:15:35.470 --> 01:15:35.800
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1818
01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:38.200
<v Speaker 1>how well is what you know working for you,</v>

1819
01:15:38.770 --> 01:15:38.950
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1820
01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:39.430
<v Speaker 1>If you can,</v>

1821
01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:40.840
<v Speaker 1>are you who you should be,</v>

1822
01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:42.790
<v Speaker 1>are you who you couldn't be happy,</v>

1823
01:15:42.791 --> 01:15:44.650
<v Speaker 1>you the world right around you?</v>

1824
01:15:44.730 --> 01:15:45.880
<v Speaker 1>Or if the answer is no,</v>

1825
01:15:45.881 --> 01:15:47.830
<v Speaker 1>then what you know is to not obviously,</v>

1826
01:15:47.831 --> 01:15:49.570
<v Speaker 1>because what are you doing?</v>

1827
01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:52.530
<v Speaker 1>There's always things that you couldn't be doing that you're not doing it,</v>

1828
01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:54.370
<v Speaker 1>so you have a lot to learn.</v>

1829
01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:00.000
<v Speaker 1>You know I wrote in chapter nine that you should assume that the person you're</v>

1830
01:16:00.971 --> 01:16:01.600
<v Speaker 1>listening to,</v>

1831
01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:03.010
<v Speaker 1>those something you build,</v>

1832
01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:05.050
<v Speaker 1>and this is a great thing.</v>

1833
01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:06.780
<v Speaker 1>This is a really intermarriage I can.</v>

1834
01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:07.900
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you this.</v>

1835
01:16:07.990 --> 01:16:09.100
<v Speaker 1>If you want to improve your parents,</v>

1836
01:16:09.101 --> 01:16:10.270
<v Speaker 1>your relationship with your kids,</v>

1837
01:16:10.271 --> 01:16:11.650
<v Speaker 1>any intimate relationship,</v>

1838
01:16:11.770 --> 01:16:13.430
<v Speaker 1>this is something really worth knowing.</v>

1839
01:16:13.940 --> 01:16:16.930
<v Speaker 1>You don't have your children or your wife and your husband,</v>

1840
01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:18.610
<v Speaker 1>her unbelievably annoying.</v>

1841
01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:20.540
<v Speaker 1>You have to live with her was wrong,</v>

1842
01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:20.740
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>

1843
01:16:20.740 --> 01:16:24.030
<v Speaker 1>Everything I saw them,</v>

1844
01:16:25.030 --> 01:16:30.030
<v Speaker 1>but here's the things that even if 90 percent of what they're telling you is</v>

1845
01:16:30.071 --> 01:16:30.904
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>

1846
01:16:31.390 --> 01:16:33.650
<v Speaker 1>10 percent of these right now,</v>

1847
01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:35.290
<v Speaker 1>if your wife was criticizing you,</v>

1848
01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:37.350
<v Speaker 1>which is a high probability of error,</v>

1849
01:16:38.580 --> 01:16:43.580
<v Speaker 1>you have to help her figure out her criticisms as accurate as possible and you</v>

1850
01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:46.960
<v Speaker 1>want to defend myself a go.</v>

1851
01:16:46.990 --> 01:16:49.370
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough assumption of innocence and all of that,</v>

1852
01:16:49.860 --> 01:16:51.040
<v Speaker 1>but that's not the point.</v>

1853
01:16:51.220 --> 01:16:55.150
<v Speaker 1>The point is you're going to have to play this game with her and hopefully you</v>

1854
01:16:55.151 --> 01:17:00.010
<v Speaker 1>would like again to approve across time and the probability that you're carrying</v>

1855
01:17:00.011 --> 01:17:02.580
<v Speaker 1>some baggage along that isn't babies.</v>

1856
01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:06.760
<v Speaker 1>It's three high earnings for percent.</v>

1857
01:17:10.210 --> 01:17:11.620
<v Speaker 1>Listen to her.</v>

1858
01:17:11.770 --> 01:17:15.890
<v Speaker 1>Someone around with her and criticisms</v>

1859
01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:19.380
<v Speaker 1>one one.</v>

1860
01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:20.690
<v Speaker 1>Are you on target?</v>

1861
01:17:20.691 --> 01:17:21.170
<v Speaker 1>Anything?</v>

1862
01:17:21.170 --> 01:17:21.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

1863
01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:22.220
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1864
01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:24.080
<v Speaker 1>I really stupid like that.</v>

1865
01:17:24.850 --> 01:17:29.850
<v Speaker 1>And then you favor because stupid people fall into a pit when they walk more and</v>

1866
01:17:30.711 --> 01:17:35.711
<v Speaker 1>so maybe not being hit that you could avoid and so well in mass and then it's a</v>

1867
01:17:36.711 --> 01:17:36.981
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1868
01:17:36.981 --> 01:17:37.730
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1869
01:17:37.730 --> 01:17:39.250
<v Speaker 1>so you.</v>

1870
01:17:39.770 --> 01:17:42.770
<v Speaker 1>You listened to people as if they might have something to tell you because</v>

1871
01:17:42.771 --> 01:17:45.920
<v Speaker 1>there's the off chance that they can provide you with a bit of information that</v>

1872
01:17:45.921 --> 01:17:50.921
<v Speaker 1>would be not be so stupid as your down and if you really understand that there's</v>

1873
01:17:51.321 --> 01:17:54.170
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of things that you have to go right and then you're not doing great at</v>

1874
01:17:54.171 --> 01:17:54.770
<v Speaker 1>that you're not.</v>

1875
01:17:54.770 --> 01:17:56.890
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't be or could be added.</v>

1876
01:17:56.930 --> 01:18:00.470
<v Speaker 1>That's actually important that you can come out and maybe you're desperate and</v>

1877
01:18:00.471 --> 01:18:03.610
<v Speaker 1>you're grasping every time you'd have a conversation with someone,</v>

1878
01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:08.370
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of truth that they might be struggling to articulate that so you</v>

1879
01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:11.140
<v Speaker 1>can walk away with the gold from the dragging.</v>

1880
01:18:11.870 --> 01:18:12.081
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1881
01:18:12.081 --> 01:18:14.390
<v Speaker 1>because it's still fun confronting and a response,</v>

1882
01:18:14.450 --> 01:18:15.091
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure,</v>

1883
01:18:15.091 --> 01:18:18.770
<v Speaker 1>but maybe they flannel in every direction and try to hack you into ribbons,</v>

1884
01:18:18.771 --> 01:18:19.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1885
01:18:19.070 --> 01:18:21.410
<v Speaker 1>because they're not very good at pointing their criticisms.</v>

1886
01:18:21.411 --> 01:18:23.900
<v Speaker 1>But it is possible that if you listened,</v>

1887
01:18:24.490 --> 01:18:26.090
<v Speaker 1>God made man.</v>

1888
01:18:26.430 --> 01:18:27.800
<v Speaker 1>I truly out and like,</v>

1889
01:18:27.801 --> 01:18:27.991
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1890
01:18:27.991 --> 01:18:29.080
<v Speaker 1>we're going to horrible itch,</v>

1891
01:18:29.090 --> 01:18:29.923
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

1892
01:18:33.770 --> 01:18:37.220
<v Speaker 1>definitely something that will make me slightly stupid that I have.</v>

1893
01:18:42.060 --> 01:18:47.060
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

1894
01:18:54.210 --> 01:18:57.460
<v Speaker 1>So to recap,</v>

1895
01:18:59.550 --> 01:19:02.180
<v Speaker 1>set forth a set of propositions.</v>

1896
01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:07.760
<v Speaker 1>The first proposition is that there is a very large number of ways of</v>

1897
01:19:07.761 --> 01:19:12.390
<v Speaker 1>interpreting the world and so that leads us into the domain of horrible belt</v>

1898
01:19:12.430 --> 01:19:13.263
<v Speaker 1>visit.</v>

1899
01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.980
<v Speaker 1>There's all sorts of horrors that lurk there,</v>

1900
01:19:17.390 --> 01:19:18.770
<v Speaker 1>but it's a powerful idea.</v>

1901
01:19:19.010 --> 01:19:21.980
<v Speaker 1>There's some truth to it because the world is very complex and there's lots of</v>

1902
01:19:21.981 --> 01:19:25.400
<v Speaker 1>ways of looking at and maybe but then,</v>

1903
01:19:25.450 --> 01:19:26.690
<v Speaker 1>but then that's constraint.</v>

1904
01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:28.640
<v Speaker 1>We talked about how it might be constraints.</v>

1905
01:19:28.641 --> 01:19:33.260
<v Speaker 1>Constraint is constrained by the SSS necessity of planning integrative social</v>

1906
01:19:33.261 --> 01:19:35.870
<v Speaker 1>gates and also being not only social games,</v>

1907
01:19:36.060 --> 01:19:40.250
<v Speaker 1>games that don't have the natural world kill you as well because there's always</v>

1908
01:19:40.251 --> 01:19:40.551
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1909
01:19:40.551 --> 01:19:40.970
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1910
01:19:40.970 --> 01:19:44.810
<v Speaker 1>You have to conduct yourself in a way that makes other people except you,</v>

1911
01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:46.130
<v Speaker 1>including your future self,</v>

1912
01:19:46.131 --> 01:19:50.570
<v Speaker 1>but you also have to not just die and so that's another set of very powerful</v>

1913
01:19:50.571 --> 01:19:52.480
<v Speaker 1>constraints and then be foreign law.</v>

1914
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:58.000
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's a pattern to the bones of being that fulfill those criteria and</v>

1915
01:19:58.311 --> 01:20:02.900
<v Speaker 1>maybe as human beings have observed themselves over centuries or millennia and</v>

1916
01:20:02.901 --> 01:20:07.100
<v Speaker 1>we've crafted stories about figures of good fingers of evil.</v>

1917
01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:11.100
<v Speaker 1>We be trying to do is to represent that pattern that allows us to sustain</v>

1918
01:20:11.101 --> 01:20:15.060
<v Speaker 1>ourselves to thrive across the multiple sets of ethical games that were played</v>

1919
01:20:15.420 --> 01:20:15.970
<v Speaker 1>and then it's not,</v>

1920
01:20:15.970 --> 01:20:17.880
<v Speaker 1>in fact the idea of the mental health,</v>

1921
01:20:17.970 --> 01:20:18.181
<v Speaker 1>human,</v>

1922
01:20:18.181 --> 01:20:19.140
<v Speaker 1>what we send out,</v>

1923
01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:24.980
<v Speaker 1>our deepest religious preconceptions emerge and their branded an accurate</v>

1924
01:20:25.051 --> 01:20:28.200
<v Speaker 1>reflection of the way that people conduct themselves in the world and that's the</v>

1925
01:20:28.201 --> 01:20:30.000
<v Speaker 1>ideal app which to me,</v>

1926
01:20:30.650 --> 01:20:32.880
<v Speaker 1>and that requires</v>

1927
01:20:36.140 --> 01:20:36.801
<v Speaker 1>and requirements.</v>

1928
01:20:36.801 --> 01:20:40.070
<v Speaker 1>The willingness to understand what that what you don't know is more important</v>

1929
01:20:40.071 --> 01:20:44.960
<v Speaker 1>than what you know and it requires the willingness to lay yourself open to the</v>

1930
01:20:44.961 --> 01:20:48.830
<v Speaker 1>fire that consumes it destroys a you and it's a very,</v>

1931
01:20:48.831 --> 01:20:50.180
<v Speaker 1>very difficult thing to.</v>

1932
01:20:50.950 --> 01:20:51.531
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>

1933
01:20:51.531 --> 01:20:52.940
<v Speaker 1>very difficult thing to submit to you,</v>

1934
01:20:52.941 --> 01:20:57.560
<v Speaker 1>which is where people don't submit to it and it's no wonder that the rewards are</v>

1935
01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:01.580
<v Speaker 1>tremendous and their punishments for not doing it as hell.</v>

1936
01:21:15.330 --> 01:21:16.680
<v Speaker 1>I think I'll stop with that.</v>

1937
01:21:18.550 --> 01:21:23.550
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

1938
01:21:37.470 --> 01:21:42.470
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

1939
01:21:43.390 --> 01:21:48.390
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

1940
01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:55.783
<v Speaker 1>After</v>

1941
01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.560
<v Speaker 1>number one,</v>

1942
01:22:01.820 --> 01:22:02.870
<v Speaker 1>thinking on your feet,</v>

1943
01:22:05.470 --> 01:22:06.850
<v Speaker 1>all these talks,</v>

1944
01:22:06.890 --> 01:22:11.890
<v Speaker 1>that gives me an opportunity to continue to develop thinking about and also to</v>

1945
01:22:12.381 --> 01:22:15.650
<v Speaker 1>see what the consequences of that are real time.</v>

1946
01:22:15.910 --> 01:22:17.650
<v Speaker 1>So I think that the BDC,</v>

1947
01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:18.900
<v Speaker 1>these talks,</v>

1948
01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:23.240
<v Speaker 1>they're not hear their conversations and you might think,</v>

1949
01:22:23.241 --> 01:22:26.760
<v Speaker 1>well they can be because I'm the only one talking</v>

1950
01:22:28.450 --> 01:22:29.283
<v Speaker 1>terms.</v>

1951
01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:34.500
<v Speaker 1>It's not true because people communicate box of what we communicate with words,</v>

1952
01:22:35.091 --> 01:22:40.040
<v Speaker 1>but we also communicate with our facial expressions and with our bodily posture</v>

1953
01:22:40.041 --> 01:22:41.710
<v Speaker 1>and with our our movements.</v>

1954
01:22:41.930 --> 01:22:42.220
<v Speaker 1>I can.</v>

1955
01:22:42.220 --> 01:22:45.710
<v Speaker 1>I can tell if I'm wanting to something that's working properly,</v>

1956
01:22:45.711 --> 01:22:50.711
<v Speaker 1>I can tell because no one in the audience moves and it's so cool.</v>

1957
01:22:50.751 --> 01:22:51.250
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

1958
01:22:51.250 --> 01:22:52.071
<v Speaker 1>It's the same reason to.</v>

1959
01:22:52.071 --> 01:22:53.930
<v Speaker 1>The rabbit doesn't move when it looks at a wolf.</v>

1960
01:22:54.810 --> 01:22:55.880
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing.</v>

1961
01:22:56.100 --> 01:22:59.600
<v Speaker 1>If it's the same cycle physiological systems and it's.</v>

1962
01:22:59.780 --> 01:23:03.550
<v Speaker 1>It's the art part of your brain that evolved to Dka predators.</v>

1963
01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:06.220
<v Speaker 1>These transfixed an idea</v>

1964
01:23:06.550 --> 01:23:10.470
<v Speaker 3>because the idea has the idea has something that's inspiring,</v>

1965
01:23:10.510 --> 01:23:11.620
<v Speaker 3>wrapped up inside of it,</v>

1966
01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:17.040
<v Speaker 3>and you can detect that and so you freeze and so I've known that I wanted to</v>

1967
01:23:17.291 --> 01:23:19.570
<v Speaker 3>something that has the same archetipal significance.</v>

1968
01:23:19.571 --> 01:23:22.570
<v Speaker 3>If everybody in the audience doesn't move and so,</v>

1969
01:23:22.660 --> 01:23:27.660
<v Speaker 3>but that's kind of what you want for the talk is to see to see how much the</v>

1970
01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:32.620
<v Speaker 3>dining and keep the audience transfixed in some sense and that transaction is so</v>

1971
01:23:32.621 --> 01:23:37.621
<v Speaker 3>interesting because it's a manifestation of their instinct for being held so</v>

1972
01:23:38.310 --> 01:23:39.190
<v Speaker 3>because when you're.</v>

1973
01:23:42.340 --> 01:23:42.970
<v Speaker 3>When you're,</v>

1974
01:23:42.970 --> 01:23:43.780
<v Speaker 3>when you're,</v>

1975
01:23:43.780 --> 01:23:46.570
<v Speaker 3>when you encounter something meaningful drugs to the encounter and what the</v>

1976
01:23:46.571 --> 01:23:47.570
<v Speaker 3>world is made up,</v>

1977
01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:48.540
<v Speaker 3>that's a very,</v>

1978
01:23:48.540 --> 01:23:49.180
<v Speaker 3>very concrete.</v>

1979
01:23:49.180 --> 01:23:51.640
<v Speaker 3>What matters in the world is made out of what matters.</v>

1980
01:23:51.820 --> 01:23:53.640
<v Speaker 3>It really is Beethoven for practice.</v>

1981
01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:55.153
<v Speaker 3>There's two.</v>

1982
01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:58.090
<v Speaker 3>There's two definitions for that.</v>

1983
01:23:58.530 --> 01:23:59.410
<v Speaker 3>For that word.</v>

1984
01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:03.790
<v Speaker 3>We act like the world is data and Madison and then when you encountered that,</v>

1985
01:24:03.791 --> 01:24:05.080
<v Speaker 3>that it transfixes you,</v>

1986
01:24:05.350 --> 01:24:09.130
<v Speaker 3>and so if you're speaking to an audience and you're paying attention by watching</v>

1987
01:24:09.131 --> 01:24:11.250
<v Speaker 3>the audience because you're not afraid of the audience,</v>

1988
01:24:11.251 --> 01:24:13.000
<v Speaker 3>let's say apprehensive of the audience,</v>

1989
01:24:13.001 --> 01:24:13.990
<v Speaker 3>but not afraid of it,</v>

1990
01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:17.920
<v Speaker 3>then you can tell when you're pursuing a pathway that has,</v>

1991
01:24:18.190 --> 01:24:23.190
<v Speaker 3>it has substance and so it's a great opportunity to to communicate in real time.</v>

1992
01:24:25.710 --> 01:24:26.770
<v Speaker 3>It's a good example.</v>

1993
01:24:26.890 --> 01:24:30.070
<v Speaker 3>I think it's the best example of a very good example of what free speech is so</v>

1994
01:24:30.071 --> 01:24:31.360
<v Speaker 3>important because see,</v>

1995
01:24:31.361 --> 01:24:33.980
<v Speaker 3>this is how you can fake because you can't think,</v>

1996
01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:34.310
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1997
01:24:34.310 --> 01:24:37.720
<v Speaker 3>because you're too stupid and bias and ignorant and curriculum,</v>

1998
01:24:37.810 --> 01:24:41.590
<v Speaker 3>narrow minded and unidimensional and so you can take a little bit,</v>

1999
01:24:41.591 --> 01:24:45.100
<v Speaker 3>but he can't really think to get your thoughts out there and other people can</v>

2000
01:24:45.101 --> 01:24:46.150
<v Speaker 3>kind of fall on them.</v>

2001
01:24:46.450 --> 01:24:47.201
<v Speaker 3>In some sense.</v>

2002
01:24:47.201 --> 01:24:50.360
<v Speaker 3>That's the free market of ideas that sharpens you up with your,</v>

2003
01:24:50.390 --> 01:24:51.040
<v Speaker 3>with your.</v>

2004
01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:56.040
<v Speaker 3>If you're willing and able to let that opinion habits the way we were thinking.</v>

2005
01:24:56.470 --> 01:24:57.010
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2006
01:24:57.010 --> 01:25:00.070
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't mean that you're blind follower if the crowd.</v>

2007
01:25:00.810 --> 01:25:03.370
<v Speaker 3>It's not the life that it has to be more sophisticated than that,</v>

2008
01:25:03.371 --> 01:25:03.980
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2009
01:25:03.980 --> 01:25:04.850
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

2010
01:25:06.580 --> 01:25:06.791
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

2011
01:25:06.791 --> 01:25:08.470
<v Speaker 3>so I don't care if I get through the rules,</v>

2012
01:25:08.490 --> 01:25:08.711
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2013
01:25:08.711 --> 01:25:11.830
<v Speaker 3>it's not because it's about the process that generates the rules.</v>

2014
01:25:11.950 --> 01:25:12.910
<v Speaker 3>That's what it's about.</v>

2015
01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.240
<v Speaker 3>And a good talk is,</v>

2016
01:25:14.390 --> 01:25:15.300
<v Speaker 3>is that it's,</v>

2017
01:25:15.580 --> 01:25:20.240
<v Speaker 3>it's active participation in the process that transforms potential into</v>

2018
01:25:20.270 --> 01:25:23.830
<v Speaker 3>actuality that African women last participated in that because that's,</v>

2019
01:25:24.130 --> 01:25:25.450
<v Speaker 3>that's the core of the world,</v>

2020
01:25:25.451 --> 01:25:25.960
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2021
01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:27.190
<v Speaker 3>that's the core of the work.</v>

2022
01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:28.713
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

2023
01:25:28.810 --> 01:25:29.643
<v Speaker 3>Well</v>

2024
01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:34.910
<v Speaker 3>thanks.</v>

2025
01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:36.160
<v Speaker 3>Have a great lesson</v>

2026
01:25:37.910 --> 01:25:38.390
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

2027
01:25:38.390 --> 01:25:39.970
<v Speaker 3>What I was saying about this week that I got.</v>

2028
01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:42.880
<v Speaker 3>Did you guys ever offered.</v>

2029
01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:43.460
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2030
01:25:43.460 --> 01:25:44.000
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

2031
01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:47.980
<v Speaker 3>so there's an affiliate that there will be picture that I think it's his</v>

2032
01:25:47.981 --> 01:25:50.690
<v Speaker 3>girlfriend and showed all the people in the audience.</v>

2033
01:25:52.830 --> 01:25:57.830
<v Speaker 3>It was so great to be here with so many peers in bed because he doesn't talk</v>

2034
01:25:58.001 --> 01:25:59.840
<v Speaker 3>about his daily life basically.</v>

2035
01:26:00.270 --> 01:26:01.103
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

2036
01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:03.933
<v Speaker 3>was</v>

2037
01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:12.380
<v Speaker 3>sort of a coming out coming out like I'm okay with listening to ideas that</v>

2038
01:26:13.661 --> 01:26:18.661
<v Speaker 3>that's fascinating to me that people in their regular life that Peterson got</v>

2039
01:26:19.540 --> 01:26:20.930
<v Speaker 3>that somehow controversial</v>

2040
01:26:26.140 --> 01:26:31.140
<v Speaker 3>thank in some ways because I think the reason that uncontroversial most quite</v>

2041
01:26:33.531 --> 01:26:34.590
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous because</v>

2042
01:26:37.060 --> 01:26:41.210
<v Speaker 3>being painted with this sort of Albright depressed from time to time because I</v>

2043
01:26:41.220 --> 01:26:46.220
<v Speaker 3>stood up against art stood up against I suppose what I regarded as some of the</v>

2044
01:26:46.551 --> 01:26:51.551
<v Speaker 3>excesses of the 11th and one was about the transgender program issue.</v>

2045
01:26:53.050 --> 01:26:56.720
<v Speaker 3>It's like I fought for a long time ever since I started teaching.</v>

2046
01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:02.060
<v Speaker 3>I started teaching him to gale and I went to Boston and then I came to Toronto.</v>

2047
01:27:02.210 --> 01:27:05.180
<v Speaker 3>I thought for years that if anybody ever actually figured out what I was</v>

2048
01:27:05.181 --> 01:27:06.680
<v Speaker 3>teaching about health debate,</v>

2049
01:27:07.860 --> 01:27:12.860
<v Speaker 3>because honestly radical until ridiculously rapid though,</v>

2050
01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:18.000
<v Speaker 3>the political radical part of it is just surface noise.</v>

2051
01:27:18.380 --> 01:27:23.380
<v Speaker 3>I would say there's things underneath editor way more than that because I really</v>

2052
01:27:24.651 --> 01:27:25.940
<v Speaker 3>do believe what I told him tonight.</v>

2053
01:27:25.941 --> 01:27:29.810
<v Speaker 3>I do believe that human beings are divine locus of consciousness and I do</v>

2054
01:27:29.811 --> 01:27:32.420
<v Speaker 3>believe that consciousness creates or from potential,</v>

2055
01:27:32.770 --> 01:27:36.080
<v Speaker 3>and I do believe that our wines are fundamentally ethical and then they make a</v>

2056
01:27:36.081 --> 01:27:38.390
<v Speaker 3>decision between heaven and hell every time we have.</v>

2057
01:27:38.630 --> 01:27:40.100
<v Speaker 3>I think those things are true.</v>

2058
01:27:40.340 --> 01:27:40.761
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

2059
01:27:40.761 --> 01:27:44.440
<v Speaker 3>I think the neurological evidence suggests that they're true of really</v>

2060
01:27:44.450 --> 01:27:46.810
<v Speaker 3>interesting conversation with the Ian Mcgilchrist,</v>

2061
01:27:46.811 --> 01:27:48.440
<v Speaker 3>which you guys might want to look up on that.</v>

2062
01:27:48.441 --> 01:27:49.940
<v Speaker 3>We're going to talk about that more.</v>

2063
01:27:50.690 --> 01:27:54.890
<v Speaker 3>I think these fundamental benefits of presuppositions are the truest things</v>

2064
01:27:54.891 --> 01:27:55.760
<v Speaker 3>there are,</v>

2065
01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:59.770
<v Speaker 3>and so that's crazy radical and so we probably shouldn't have listened to the</v>

2066
01:27:59.771 --> 01:28:00.270
<v Speaker 3>beach front.</v>

2067
01:28:00.270 --> 01:28:04.790
<v Speaker 3>Just go home and hide under your bed longer than out here.</v>

2068
01:28:04.850 --> 01:28:08.960
<v Speaker 3>I guess we'll do a couple of questions to asked me all the time.</v>

2069
01:28:08.961 --> 01:28:11.950
<v Speaker 3>What is Jordan like La Capra,</v>

2070
01:28:12.540 --> 01:28:13.180
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

2071
01:28:13.180 --> 01:28:16.140
<v Speaker 3>this is the bad all the time by sharing.</v>

2072
01:28:16.150 --> 01:28:17.030
<v Speaker 3>This is the real deal.</v>

2073
01:28:17.290 --> 01:28:18.650
<v Speaker 3>There's a ton of great stuff here.</v>

2074
01:28:18.700 --> 01:28:18.890
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2075
01:28:18.890 --> 01:28:19.820
<v Speaker 3>so first off,</v>

2076
01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:23.650
<v Speaker 3>will you consider doing a guest appearance on kind of these new album</v>

2077
01:28:28.060 --> 01:28:32.670
<v Speaker 3>trying lot of weird things that the penalty in the last year and that's</v>

2078
01:28:32.690 --> 01:28:34.690
<v Speaker 3>certainly up there with the weirdness.</v>

2079
01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:42.740
<v Speaker 3>There's lots of things that have happened to make it very difficult for me to</v>

2080
01:28:42.741 --> 01:28:44.810
<v Speaker 3>say anything and believe it or not.</v>

2081
01:28:45.170 --> 01:28:49.970
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of them and just I can see you with a little blade.</v>

2082
01:28:52.670 --> 01:28:53.660
<v Speaker 3>I like this one.</v>

2083
01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:58.170
<v Speaker 3>How do you know when you give up on something when it's not worth pursuing</v>

2084
01:28:58.230 --> 01:28:59.063
<v Speaker 3>anymore?</v>

2085
01:28:59.570 --> 01:29:00.710
<v Speaker 3>That's a great question.</v>

2086
01:29:02.210 --> 01:29:02.430
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2087
01:29:02.430 --> 01:29:03.500
<v Speaker 3>I would say one,</v>

2088
01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:07.980
<v Speaker 3>one way of going to have a viable alternative,</v>

2089
01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:09.450
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2090
01:29:09.450 --> 01:29:09.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2091
01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:11.450
<v Speaker 3>so let's say you know,</v>

2092
01:29:11.610 --> 01:29:14.430
<v Speaker 3>you've dealt with the pathway and you might take well shit</v>

2093
01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:17.460
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

2094
01:29:17.460 --> 01:29:17.911
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2095
01:29:17.911 --> 01:29:18.180
<v Speaker 3>maybe,</v>

2096
01:29:18.180 --> 01:29:18.970
<v Speaker 3>maybe if you just,</v>

2097
01:29:18.970 --> 01:29:23.700
<v Speaker 3>persistence will pay off not just one of the real complicated things about life</v>

2098
01:29:23.701 --> 01:29:26.280
<v Speaker 3>because it's harder to tell the difference between</v>

2099
01:29:28.380 --> 01:29:33.380
<v Speaker 3>persistence and blind stupidity because you should obviously steve versus the</v>

2100
01:29:34.450 --> 01:29:38.960
<v Speaker 3>things that are due to failure of the is you can't predict what comes one of the</v>

2101
01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:44.570
<v Speaker 3>clinical practices and people were doubtful about what they were doing.</v>

2102
01:29:45.060 --> 01:29:50.060
<v Speaker 3>We would look at their fantasies and dreams because technically I think the</v>

2103
01:29:50.430 --> 01:29:52.520
<v Speaker 3>neurological evidence for this is quite clear.</v>

2104
01:29:53.130 --> 01:29:57.210
<v Speaker 3>Your left hemisphere tends to impose on the world a structured and predictable</v>

2105
01:29:57.211 --> 01:30:02.211
<v Speaker 3>wall and your right hemisphere looks for exceptions out the normal ones and all</v>

2106
01:30:02.690 --> 01:30:06.290
<v Speaker 3>of those exceptions and anomalies attempts to generate fantasies.</v>

2107
01:30:06.390 --> 01:30:09.630
<v Speaker 3>All my clients and you're having a relationship that you're trying to maintain</v>

2108
01:30:09.631 --> 01:30:11.010
<v Speaker 3>it when it's not very satisfying.</v>

2109
01:30:11.011 --> 01:30:13.290
<v Speaker 3>So we start having fantasies about other people.</v>

2110
01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:13.561
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2111
01:30:13.561 --> 01:30:16.530
<v Speaker 3>what's happening in your right hemisphere?</v>

2112
01:30:16.590 --> 01:30:17.900
<v Speaker 3>This is broadly speaking,</v>

2113
01:30:17.901 --> 01:30:18.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2114
01:30:18.710 --> 01:30:20.460
<v Speaker 3>so forgive me for that.</v>

2115
01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:24.600
<v Speaker 3>For the oversimplification of your right hemisphere is starting to tentatively</v>

2116
01:30:24.601 --> 01:30:29.190
<v Speaker 3>lay on alternative pathways that you might pursue and so if you're wondering</v>

2117
01:30:29.191 --> 01:30:32.250
<v Speaker 3>about whether what you're doing is worth doing and then what you might want to</v>

2118
01:30:32.251 --> 01:30:36.510
<v Speaker 3>do is sit down and make about three plans and talk to someone who you can trust</v>

2119
01:30:36.511 --> 01:30:36.691
<v Speaker 3>and say,</v>

2120
01:30:36.691 --> 01:30:36.931
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2121
01:30:36.931 --> 01:30:38.670
<v Speaker 3>if I wasn't doing this,</v>

2122
01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:43.050
<v Speaker 3>what else could I be doing that would be approximately is difficult because you</v>

2123
01:30:43.051 --> 01:30:47.190
<v Speaker 3>don't want to fool yourself into thinking you should stop just because what</v>

2124
01:30:47.220 --> 01:30:50.830
<v Speaker 3>you're doing these car and pretend that that was because you failed.</v>

2125
01:30:51.150 --> 01:30:53.100
<v Speaker 3>You have to be careful so you don't fool yourself.</v>

2126
01:30:53.101 --> 01:30:53.371
<v Speaker 3>You say,</v>

2127
01:30:53.371 --> 01:30:53.761
<v Speaker 3>well look,</v>

2128
01:30:53.761 --> 01:30:57.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm giving lay out three alternative paths that are just as difficult.</v>

2129
01:30:57.810 --> 01:31:00.710
<v Speaker 3>They would also be worthwhile and then I have some options.</v>

2130
01:31:00.740 --> 01:31:03.840
<v Speaker 3>Then you have to do the difficult things necessary to ensure that those will be</v>

2131
01:31:03.860 --> 01:31:07.800
<v Speaker 3>launched and actually have what might constitute a genuine choice,</v>

2132
01:31:08.250 --> 01:31:10.800
<v Speaker 3>and so that's how I would deal with that.</v>

2133
01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:15.160
<v Speaker 3>I love this one because someone is clearly paying attention.</v>

2134
01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:16.160
<v Speaker 3>What's going on?</v>

2135
01:31:16.310 --> 01:31:17.480
<v Speaker 3>Just at the moment,</v>

2136
01:31:17.780 --> 01:31:19.780
<v Speaker 3>our friend Eric Weinstein coined a phrase,</v>

2137
01:31:19.820 --> 01:31:24.820
<v Speaker 3>the phrase this morning that I really love all of our I he say is his selection</v>

2138
01:31:26.841 --> 01:31:30.110
<v Speaker 3>of writers who are constantly feeding.</v>

2139
01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:32.660
<v Speaker 3>So the question is what,</v>

2140
01:31:32.661 --> 01:31:35.540
<v Speaker 3>if anything should we do about the w,</v>

2141
01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:38.020
<v Speaker 3>r I t continuing to spirit?</v>

2142
01:31:38.060 --> 01:31:40.700
<v Speaker 3>You and your supporters as all right.</v>

2143
01:31:40.770 --> 01:31:41.490
<v Speaker 3>We talked a little.</v>

2144
01:31:41.490 --> 01:31:44.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't really think I should do anything about it.</v>

2145
01:31:45.230 --> 01:31:50.230
<v Speaker 3>I think that the time for me to be taken down except by my own stupidity is</v>

2146
01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:53.200
<v Speaker 3>maybe gone and so</v>

2147
01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:03.673
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2148
01:32:03.820 --> 01:32:04.653
<v Speaker 3>I'm</v>

2149
01:32:09.260 --> 01:32:14.260
<v Speaker 3>perfectly aware of how on all decisions with how easy it would be for me too.</v>

2150
01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:20.150
<v Speaker 3>You've made a major error and to suffer the consequences later,</v>

2151
01:32:20.710 --> 01:32:22.890
<v Speaker 3>but right now what's happened and that's it.</v>

2152
01:32:22.891 --> 01:32:24.000
<v Speaker 3>This has been the case,</v>

2153
01:32:24.060 --> 01:32:26.430
<v Speaker 3>probably six that Catholic newman interviewed,</v>

2154
01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:27.890
<v Speaker 3>but maybe a little bit before that</v>

2155
01:32:29.470 --> 01:32:30.750
<v Speaker 3>I can keep.</v>

2156
01:32:31.100 --> 01:32:31.920
<v Speaker 3>This isn't.</v>

2157
01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:34.020
<v Speaker 3>These criticisms aren't hurting me.</v>

2158
01:32:34.530 --> 01:32:39.530
<v Speaker 3>All these seem to be doing is drawing more attention to what I'm doing and then</v>

2159
01:32:40.140 --> 01:32:40.591
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2160
01:32:40.591 --> 01:32:44.070
<v Speaker 3>that's just fine as far as I'm concerned because I've asked myself,</v>

2161
01:32:44.071 --> 01:32:44.181
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2162
01:32:44.181 --> 01:32:45.090
<v Speaker 3>what am I doing?</v>

2163
01:32:45.480 --> 01:32:46.570
<v Speaker 3>Hell No.</v>

2164
01:32:48.870 --> 01:32:49.703
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

2165
01:32:50.100 --> 01:32:51.940
<v Speaker 3>What I'm doing is what we're doing here.</v>

2166
01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:57.510
<v Speaker 3>You know what I find most gratifying is autonomous story.</v>

2167
01:32:57.540 --> 01:32:57.820
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2168
01:32:57.820 --> 01:32:58.630
<v Speaker 3>Because,</v>

2169
01:32:58.630 --> 01:32:59.463
<v Speaker 3>because Mrs.</v>

2170
01:33:01.110 --> 01:33:01.943
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

2171
01:33:04.020 --> 01:33:04.980
<v Speaker 3>you were a.</v>

2172
01:33:05.650 --> 01:33:10.650
<v Speaker 3>It became a New York.</v>

2173
01:33:15.740 --> 01:33:17.420
<v Speaker 3>Downtown colleagues is pretty rough.</v>

2174
01:33:17.490 --> 01:33:18.740
<v Speaker 3>There's places you don't want to go.</v>

2175
01:33:18.820 --> 01:33:20.380
<v Speaker 3>And I went to some of them.</v>

2176
01:33:20.840 --> 01:33:21.673
<v Speaker 3>I'm</v>

2177
01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:25.640
<v Speaker 3>walking around with my wife.</v>

2178
01:33:26.340 --> 01:33:28.760
<v Speaker 3>We were walking down the street car pulled up,</v>

2179
01:33:28.761 --> 01:33:33.290
<v Speaker 3>you started this and this kid walked out the stylish 21,</v>

2180
01:33:33.291 --> 01:33:37.790
<v Speaker 3>22 year old and he came running up and you joined pinterest.</v>

2181
01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:38.633
<v Speaker 3>And I said yes.</v>

2182
01:33:38.660 --> 01:33:39.170
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

2183
01:33:39.170 --> 01:33:39.351
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2184
01:33:39.351 --> 01:33:40.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm so happy to meet you.</v>

2185
01:33:40.671 --> 01:33:42.280
<v Speaker 3>And he shook my hand and he said,</v>

2186
01:33:42.310 --> 01:33:45.960
<v Speaker 3>I've been watching your lectures and they really helped me get my life together,</v>

2187
01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:46.760
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2188
01:33:46.760 --> 01:33:47.181
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

2189
01:33:47.181 --> 01:33:49.320
<v Speaker 3>oh that's great because I do think that's crazy.</v>

2190
01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:50.720
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

2191
01:33:51.990 --> 01:33:53.510
<v Speaker 3>How far would you like them?</v>

2192
01:33:53.511 --> 01:33:57.050
<v Speaker 3>And then to go to some city that you haven't been to in a rough neighborhood in</v>

2193
01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:03.010
<v Speaker 3>the car comes running up to you and telling you that their license because they</v>

2194
01:34:03.140 --> 01:34:05.570
<v Speaker 3>want to be popped</v>

2195
01:34:13.010 --> 01:34:13.970
<v Speaker 2>store.</v>

2196
01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:18.340
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>

2197
01:34:18.340 --> 01:34:19.173
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

2198
01:34:20.260 --> 01:34:21.093
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute.</v>

2199
01:34:21.910 --> 01:34:23.550
<v Speaker 3>Just stay here a minute.</v>

2200
01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:24.720
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

2201
01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:25.553
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

2202
01:34:26.690 --> 01:34:31.040
<v Speaker 3>And he came home with his father and mother.</v>

2203
01:34:31.420 --> 01:34:32.300
<v Speaker 3>They were both smart,</v>

2204
01:34:32.790 --> 01:34:33.800
<v Speaker 3>really smart,</v>

2205
01:34:33.830 --> 01:34:34.061
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2206
01:34:34.061 --> 01:34:35.420
<v Speaker 3>like that kind of smiling,</v>

2207
01:34:35.620 --> 01:34:36.453
<v Speaker 3>just sort of car.</v>

2208
01:34:36.700 --> 01:34:41.110
<v Speaker 3>That's the Duchenne smile technically by the way that you do with your eyes and</v>

2209
01:34:42.130 --> 01:34:42.963
<v Speaker 3>you're</v>

2210
01:34:47.410 --> 01:34:50.180
<v Speaker 3>looking for all place with each other.</v>

2211
01:34:50.181 --> 01:34:51.180
<v Speaker 3>With the kids.</v>

2212
01:34:52.820 --> 01:34:56.570
<v Speaker 3>I've been rescuing my father from the belly of the beast basically.</v>

2213
01:34:58.150 --> 01:34:59.720
<v Speaker 3>Well now</v>

2214
01:35:12.380 --> 01:35:17.190
<v Speaker 3>he will come running up to me and they tell me stories like slaves.</v>

2215
01:35:18.700 --> 01:35:22.150
<v Speaker 3>If if the balloon size,</v>

2216
01:35:24.650 --> 01:35:28.450
<v Speaker 3>you don't jump up and down about what I'm doing and ignore all that,</v>

2217
01:35:28.570 --> 01:35:29.210
<v Speaker 3>that's fine.</v>

2218
01:35:29.210 --> 01:35:30.710
<v Speaker 3>Because I'm a psychologist.</v>

2219
01:35:31.410 --> 01:35:32.840
<v Speaker 3>I kind of just started a long time ago.</v>

2220
01:35:32.870 --> 01:35:35.390
<v Speaker 3>The locus of concern was individuals,</v>

2221
01:35:35.630 --> 01:35:37.940
<v Speaker 3>and I do believe what I told you tonight.</v>

2222
01:35:37.941 --> 01:35:42.941
<v Speaker 3>I believe that each person is a divided focus of consciousness and that any step</v>

2223
01:35:44.420 --> 01:35:47.710
<v Speaker 3>forward to making someone's life trauma better.</v>

2224
01:35:47.910 --> 01:35:49.040
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean easier.</v>

2225
01:35:49.130 --> 01:35:51.380
<v Speaker 3>I do not mean that to making it better.</v>

2226
01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:55.220
<v Speaker 3>Making them more responsible and more awake and more attentive and more truthful</v>

2227
01:35:55.221 --> 01:35:56.100
<v Speaker 3>and more properly,</v>

2228
01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:57.770
<v Speaker 3>even farther away from hell.</v>

2229
01:35:57.800 --> 01:35:58.610
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2230
01:35:58.610 --> 01:35:59.710
<v Speaker 3>that's a great thing,</v>

2231
01:35:59.711 --> 01:36:00.470
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2232
01:36:00.470 --> 01:36:02.960
<v Speaker 3>So I don't care about the rest of it,</v>

2233
01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:03.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's a pain,</v>

2234
01:36:03.981 --> 01:36:04.151
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2235
01:36:04.151 --> 01:36:05.780
<v Speaker 3>and it hurts I suppose,</v>

2236
01:36:06.380 --> 01:36:07.213
<v Speaker 3>I suppose</v>

2237
01:36:08.690 --> 01:36:13.690
<v Speaker 3>entertaining to be pilloried say the national press on many journalists and</v>

2238
01:36:13.741 --> 01:36:16.270
<v Speaker 3>supportive to me and so I've got nothing to complain about,</v>

2239
01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:18.800
<v Speaker 3>but whatever,</v>

2240
01:36:19.100 --> 01:36:21.150
<v Speaker 3>nothing worth doing is you see,</v>

2241
01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:23.990
<v Speaker 3>it wouldn't be any interesting if it wasn't,</v>

2242
01:36:24.340 --> 01:36:29.270
<v Speaker 3>so I think I can just ignore it and just try to do what I'm doing with these</v>

2243
01:36:29.271 --> 01:36:29.960
<v Speaker 3>talks.</v>

2244
01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:31.580
<v Speaker 3>So we'll see.</v>

2245
01:36:35.860 --> 01:36:40.860
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

2246
01:36:41.730 --> 01:36:46.270
<v Speaker 3>A school teacher and I'm seeing more and more ideologies push on the students.</v>

2247
01:36:46.340 --> 01:36:50.420
<v Speaker 3>How do I navigate this landscape and not jeopardize my job?</v>

2248
01:36:50.630 --> 01:36:51.463
<v Speaker 3>I get this.</v>

2249
01:36:52.770 --> 01:36:53.970
<v Speaker 3>How do you speak up?</v>

2250
01:36:54.590 --> 01:36:57.170
<v Speaker 3>The first thing that you going to figure out your job's in jeopardy</v>

2251
01:36:58.670 --> 01:37:03.520
<v Speaker 3>because on the one hand it's jeopardy because you might lose it and the other</v>

2252
01:37:03.530 --> 01:37:05.960
<v Speaker 3>habits in jeopardy because you might have to keep it</v>

2253
01:37:08.270 --> 01:37:10.250
<v Speaker 3>five years of selling your soul.</v>

2254
01:37:10.251 --> 01:37:11.490
<v Speaker 3>As a teacher,</v>

2255
01:37:11.570 --> 01:37:15.020
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be one story character and are going to see that with trump.</v>

2256
01:37:15.021 --> 01:37:17.750
<v Speaker 3>Sympathy like I'm not trying to be high.</v>

2257
01:37:18.700 --> 01:37:20.720
<v Speaker 3>You're prescribed both ways.</v>

2258
01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:25.760
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it's useful to know that because the problem is people often</v>

2259
01:37:25.761 --> 01:37:29.900
<v Speaker 3>overestimate the degree of security that they currently have and so you might</v>

2260
01:37:29.901 --> 01:37:30.561
<v Speaker 3>ask yourself,</v>

2261
01:37:30.561 --> 01:37:31.394
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2262
01:37:32.150 --> 01:37:33.690
<v Speaker 3>what are you going to look like in five years?</v>

2263
01:37:33.700 --> 01:37:35.090
<v Speaker 3>If you have to swallow that,</v>

2264
01:37:35.690 --> 01:37:38.050
<v Speaker 3>you have to teach it because you don't oppose it.</v>

2265
01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:39.290
<v Speaker 3>Believe me,</v>

2266
01:37:39.290 --> 01:37:43.100
<v Speaker 3>there'll be no end to it because those sorts of things don't stop until someone</v>

2267
01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:47.830
<v Speaker 3>stops because the people who are pushing the limit and then he'll just push them</v>

2268
01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.240
<v Speaker 3>to go take another little piece of your soul,</v>

2269
01:37:50.420 --> 01:37:51.570
<v Speaker 3>and so sometimes you think,</v>

2270
01:37:52.290 --> 01:37:53.123
<v Speaker 3>oh good.</v>

2271
01:37:53.630 --> 01:37:55.130
<v Speaker 3>That means I can do what I want.</v>

2272
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:56.281
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

2273
01:37:56.281 --> 01:37:58.060
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't mean you shouldn't be stupid about it.</v>

2274
01:37:58.530 --> 01:37:58.721
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2275
01:37:58.721 --> 01:38:00.350
<v Speaker 3>and lots of people have asked me this question.</v>

2276
01:38:00.351 --> 01:38:00.570
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2277
01:38:00.570 --> 01:38:00.850
<v Speaker 3>well sure,</v>

2278
01:38:00.850 --> 01:38:04.860
<v Speaker 3>I stand up against the creeping in theology in high school as a teacher.</v>

2279
01:38:04.861 --> 01:38:05.190
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2280
01:38:05.190 --> 01:38:06.023
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2281
01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:06.930
<v Speaker 3>you have family,</v>

2282
01:38:06.931 --> 01:38:07.711
<v Speaker 3>you have kids.</v>

2283
01:38:07.711 --> 01:38:09.270
<v Speaker 3>Do you have people who are relying on you?</v>

2284
01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:14.150
<v Speaker 3>You can't just let yourself on fiber protests and the little pile bash and</v>

2285
01:38:14.220 --> 01:38:14.361
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2286
01:38:14.361 --> 01:38:17.430
<v Speaker 3>Although it is true that start with a good plan.</v>

2287
01:38:17.940 --> 01:38:21.830
<v Speaker 3>So what do you need to do with your secretary kind of smart and how often you go</v>

2288
01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:22.430
<v Speaker 3>to figure out,</v>

2289
01:38:22.430 --> 01:38:22.891
<v Speaker 3>you've got to think,</v>

2290
01:38:22.891 --> 01:38:23.191
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2291
01:38:23.191 --> 01:38:23.730
<v Speaker 3>well I'm,</v>

2292
01:38:23.730 --> 01:38:28.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm in a war and a war is a sequence of balanced and the smaller the battle of</v>

2293
01:38:28.691 --> 01:38:31.980
<v Speaker 3>the better and they're starting to think strategically and you lay out your</v>

2294
01:38:31.981 --> 01:38:36.690
<v Speaker 3>options and have you had you fortify your territory and shove it the tongue and</v>

2295
01:38:36.691 --> 01:38:38.800
<v Speaker 3>you decided that you're going to do something about you.</v>

2296
01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:42.210
<v Speaker 3>Don't get all the impulsive that can stand back and yelling at the principal</v>

2297
01:38:42.211 --> 01:38:43.440
<v Speaker 3>because he's maybe logical,</v>

2298
01:38:43.450 --> 01:38:45.870
<v Speaker 3>moral because you're just done.</v>

2299
01:38:45.900 --> 01:38:47.250
<v Speaker 3>What the hell good is that?</v>

2300
01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:51.690
<v Speaker 3>So if you know that your soul is being corrupted by the logs,</v>

2301
01:38:51.691 --> 01:38:55.800
<v Speaker 3>then it's time to wake the hell up and to start thinking and acting</v>

2302
01:38:55.801 --> 01:38:56.634
<v Speaker 3>strategically.</v>

2303
01:38:56.760 --> 01:38:57.211
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

2304
01:38:57.211 --> 01:39:02.211
<v Speaker 3>you might want to lay out three options for other employment so you know that if</v>

2305
01:39:02.581 --> 01:39:06.060
<v Speaker 3>he could come off at the nice to have options because otherwise you've got so</v>

2306
01:39:06.061 --> 01:39:08.370
<v Speaker 3>much at stake and won't be able to be courageous.</v>

2307
01:39:08.910 --> 01:39:12.570
<v Speaker 3>So when you notice that you stand back.</v>

2308
01:39:12.660 --> 01:39:14.230
<v Speaker 3>We up with these types of things,</v>

2309
01:39:14.610 --> 01:39:17.280
<v Speaker 3>it maybe you're into the adventure of your life at that point.</v>

2310
01:39:17.550 --> 01:39:22.440
<v Speaker 3>It only ever know so they won't do it impulsively or careless with the customer.</v>

2311
01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:26.670
<v Speaker 3>It's just not as useful as feeding the cattle,</v>

2312
01:39:26.730 --> 01:39:31.730
<v Speaker 3>the snake in the snake like and windows in an informed way and with some humor</v>

2313
01:39:34.651 --> 01:39:37.860
<v Speaker 3>and some detachment and and some care.</v>

2314
01:39:38.160 --> 01:39:41.120
<v Speaker 3>So it's a war going on and you don't want to lose the warmth.</v>

2315
01:39:41.150 --> 01:39:46.150
<v Speaker 3>The first vowel is not helpful so I like thank you.</v>

2316
01:39:52.420 --> 01:39:53.253
<v Speaker 3>Ready.</v>

2317
01:39:54.150 --> 01:39:59.150
<v Speaker 3>Would you please reconsider your decision not to run for Prime Minister</v>

2318
01:40:02.180 --> 01:40:07.180
<v Speaker 3>Thatcher?</v>

2319
01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:14.880
<v Speaker 3>Like I've thought about political career since I was 14.</v>

2320
01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:20.120
<v Speaker 3>I ran for vice president for the Elbert met Peter and Stuart teeth are lost by</v>

2321
01:40:20.510 --> 01:40:22.340
<v Speaker 3>nine votes at 800.</v>

2322
01:40:22.350 --> 01:40:26.970
<v Speaker 3>So that was the first time I spoke in front of a group and the first time the</v>

2323
01:40:26.971 --> 01:40:27.804
<v Speaker 3>press line,</v>

2324
01:40:28.170 --> 01:40:29.110
<v Speaker 3>which is</v>

2325
01:40:33.790 --> 01:40:34.810
<v Speaker 3>so fun.</v>

2326
01:40:37.590 --> 01:40:42.590
<v Speaker 3>I've always decided not to do it because it's not perfect enough for.</v>

2327
01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:43.810
<v Speaker 3>Don't fake.</v>

2328
01:40:43.810 --> 01:40:47.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean I found repeatedly throughout my life but.</v>

2329
01:40:47.970 --> 01:40:50.820
<v Speaker 3>But first of all,</v>

2330
01:40:50.850 --> 01:40:52.830
<v Speaker 3>it's not obvious to me that I know enough.</v>

2331
01:40:54.220 --> 01:40:54.480
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2332
01:40:54.480 --> 01:40:56.390
<v Speaker 3>Like are trained as a psychologist,</v>

2333
01:40:56.680 --> 01:41:00.830
<v Speaker 3>I know all this arcade material that I've been talking to you about tonight and</v>

2334
01:41:00.910 --> 01:41:02.680
<v Speaker 3>I have a bit of practical knowledge,</v>

2335
01:41:02.681 --> 01:41:04.450
<v Speaker 3>but go out and you know,</v>

2336
01:41:04.550 --> 01:41:09.550
<v Speaker 3>being being a politician and running something as complicated saves Ontario and</v>

2337
01:41:11.610 --> 01:41:11.920
<v Speaker 3>not much.</v>

2338
01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:15.400
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to study in order to be really good at that.</v>

2339
01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:17.430
<v Speaker 3>We look at what's happened to her,</v>

2340
01:41:17.550 --> 01:41:18.383
<v Speaker 3>like our,</v>

2341
01:41:18.420 --> 01:41:23.290
<v Speaker 3>our hydro power grid and the utilities don't target people that are going to</v>

2342
01:41:23.291 --> 01:41:26.070
<v Speaker 3>what the hell are you doing running them and it's just a bloody catastrophe and</v>

2343
01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:27.780
<v Speaker 3>that's just a training every</v>

2344
01:41:29.830 --> 01:41:34.330
<v Speaker 3>thank.</v>

2345
01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:35.950
<v Speaker 3>I've talked to my wife about 30.</v>

2346
01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:39.010
<v Speaker 3>We had talked about it from the Conservative Party.</v>

2347
01:41:39.010 --> 01:41:42.190
<v Speaker 3>Started moving closer to your neck in Ontario three months ago.</v>

2348
01:41:42.191 --> 01:41:42.551
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>

2349
01:41:42.551 --> 01:41:43.384
<v Speaker 3>well you know,</v>

2350
01:41:44.340 --> 01:41:46.720
<v Speaker 3>particularly there are supposed to take it.</v>

2351
01:41:46.721 --> 01:41:47.141
<v Speaker 3>And I thought,</v>

2352
01:41:47.141 --> 01:41:47.531
<v Speaker 3>Jesus,</v>

2353
01:41:47.531 --> 01:41:52.531
<v Speaker 3>I have to sit in my house and study economics intensely for like 16 hours a day</v>

2354
01:41:56.171 --> 01:42:01.000
<v Speaker 3>for a whole year before I could even be ready to even contemplate the idea that</v>

2355
01:42:01.001 --> 01:42:04.780
<v Speaker 3>I could be safety competent to deal with the sorts of things that have to be</v>

2356
01:42:04.781 --> 01:42:05.614
<v Speaker 3>dealt with them.</v>

2357
01:42:05.900 --> 01:42:07.410
<v Speaker 3>Is just so of,</v>

2358
01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:12.040
<v Speaker 3>and then the other part is I don't think there's anything wrong with what I</v>

2359
01:42:12.041 --> 01:42:13.120
<v Speaker 3>currently do it.</v>

2360
01:42:17.530 --> 01:42:21.560
<v Speaker 3>Thanks.</v>

2361
01:42:21.990 --> 01:42:23.220
<v Speaker 3>I think we</v>

2362
01:42:25.030 --> 01:42:27.130
<v Speaker 3>took a detour to the political agreement.</v>

2363
01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:32.890
<v Speaker 3>See what I thought about with the parents to the conservative government.</v>

2364
01:42:32.900 --> 01:42:34.620
<v Speaker 3>In turn it was,</v>

2365
01:42:34.630 --> 01:42:35.650
<v Speaker 3>here's the worst case</v>

2366
01:42:38.290 --> 01:42:38.761
<v Speaker 3>I run,</v>

2367
01:42:38.761 --> 01:42:39.594
<v Speaker 3>I win,</v>

2368
01:42:39.910 --> 01:42:42.880
<v Speaker 3>I win the election that I got off the premium.</v>

2369
01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:44.700
<v Speaker 3>It's like what they.</v>

2370
01:42:44.700 --> 01:42:46.410
<v Speaker 3>That's not a lab,</v>

2371
01:42:47.370 --> 01:42:49.190
<v Speaker 3>a stupid plan,</v>

2372
01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:52.110
<v Speaker 3>so don't go in there.</v>

2373
01:42:52.310 --> 01:42:53.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm just not prepared for it,</v>

2374
01:42:53.480 --> 01:42:54.670
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>

2375
01:42:54.890 --> 01:42:56.420
<v Speaker 3>like the risk of repeating myself,</v>

2376
01:42:58.370 --> 01:43:02.590
<v Speaker 3>I'm interested in something that's deeper than that.</v>

2377
01:43:02.620 --> 01:43:05.770
<v Speaker 3>Not that I don't need more important,</v>

2378
01:43:05.771 --> 01:43:08.980
<v Speaker 3>but I mean more fundamentally in a hierarchical way.</v>

2379
01:43:09.220 --> 01:43:11.590
<v Speaker 3>I really do believe that our culture,</v>

2380
01:43:12.330 --> 01:43:13.300
<v Speaker 3>a modern culture,</v>

2381
01:43:13.301 --> 01:43:18.301
<v Speaker 3>but particularly the modern Western culture is fractured and that weren't in</v>

2382
01:43:18.401 --> 01:43:23.401
<v Speaker 3>danger because of that tractor and that things need to be so back together and</v>

2383
01:43:24.730 --> 01:43:26.830
<v Speaker 3>that's a better.</v>

2384
01:43:27.700 --> 01:43:28.421
<v Speaker 3>That's for me,</v>

2385
01:43:28.421 --> 01:43:32.620
<v Speaker 3>that's a better thing to a map and I'm more qualified to do it and so that's</v>

2386
01:43:32.621 --> 01:43:33.490
<v Speaker 3>where I should be doing,</v>

2387
01:43:33.750 --> 01:43:38.750
<v Speaker 3>so that's thank pretty sure if Justin Trudeau can do it.</v>

2388
01:43:56.100 --> 01:44:01.100
<v Speaker 3>How much longer will initiate the left to come back to center?</v>

2389
01:44:09.780 --> 01:44:11.820
<v Speaker 3>This as far as I can tell,</v>

2390
01:44:14.540 --> 01:44:16.240
<v Speaker 3>we set up a system,</v>

2391
01:44:16.241 --> 01:44:21.241
<v Speaker 3>particularly when universities were insane radical leftists and those are people</v>

2392
01:44:22.401 --> 01:44:25.450
<v Speaker 3>who still harbor the suspicion,</v>

2393
01:44:25.590 --> 01:44:27.630
<v Speaker 3>real communism as the tribe.</v>

2394
01:44:27.690 --> 01:44:32.520
<v Speaker 3>Let's say that there are some stuff like they figured out about a gender in the</v>

2395
01:44:32.521 --> 01:44:36.320
<v Speaker 3>subsidy for your activism and as long as that continues to happen,</v>

2396
01:44:37.070 --> 01:44:40.510
<v Speaker 3>there's no possibility that things are going to become more saying,</v>

2397
01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:40.900
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2398
01:44:40.900 --> 01:44:44.270
<v Speaker 3>I think what will probably happen in the next 50 years.</v>

2399
01:44:44.390 --> 01:44:45.970
<v Speaker 3>This isn't the only mind projection,</v>

2400
01:44:45.971 --> 01:44:49.010
<v Speaker 3>so there's lots of economists have been working on this idea.</v>

2401
01:44:49.570 --> 01:44:54.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna say 30 to 40 percent higher educational institutes in the US and</v>

2402
01:44:54.891 --> 01:44:57.980
<v Speaker 3>probably go bankrupt in the next 10 years and that'll.</v>

2403
01:44:58.070 --> 01:45:01.520
<v Speaker 3>That'll happen because there just isn't sustainable.</v>

2404
01:45:01.930 --> 01:45:02.763
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2405
01:45:03.080 --> 01:45:08.080
<v Speaker 3>and so that's what I see as the most likely outcome.</v>

2406
01:45:08.330 --> 01:45:11.820
<v Speaker 3>Assuming there is a likelihood that he stays on this,</v>

2407
01:45:12.470 --> 01:45:14.810
<v Speaker 3>run themselves out to the audit conclusion.</v>

2408
01:45:14.900 --> 01:45:19.220
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm not necessarily all that confident about that because one of the things</v>

2409
01:45:19.221 --> 01:45:20.650
<v Speaker 3>I do see that now</v>

2410
01:45:22.370 --> 01:45:25.450
<v Speaker 3>is the same identity all takes.</v>

2411
01:45:25.460 --> 01:45:27.890
<v Speaker 3>Insanity is fading in the corporate world,</v>

2412
01:45:28.130 --> 01:45:31.850
<v Speaker 3>which is really a shock to me because you think they're greedy capitalists who</v>

2413
01:45:31.870 --> 01:45:36.870
<v Speaker 3>have enough sense not to lead fifth called radical leftist organizations,</v>

2414
01:45:37.340 --> 01:45:39.940
<v Speaker 3>but they don't seem to have that much sense.</v>

2415
01:45:39.980 --> 01:45:42.010
<v Speaker 3>Just shows you that they're not as malevolent,</v>

2416
01:45:42.050 --> 01:45:44.180
<v Speaker 3>as tiny as you might hope that it would be.</v>

2417
01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:51.520
<v Speaker 3>So I think I don't think there's any predictably charting the course of the</v>

2418
01:45:52.971 --> 01:45:54.200
<v Speaker 3>future for us right now.</v>

2419
01:45:54.201 --> 01:45:59.090
<v Speaker 3>I think that we're in a time of strange crisis and the what will determine the</v>

2420
01:45:59.091 --> 01:46:02.870
<v Speaker 3>direction and the decisions that all human people make me go back out into the</v>

2421
01:46:02.871 --> 01:46:03.350
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

2422
01:46:03.350 --> 01:46:08.320
<v Speaker 3>You're already going to be sensible and articulate and responsible and we're</v>

2423
01:46:08.321 --> 01:46:13.321
<v Speaker 3>awake and attentive or able to contribute to the idiot chaos of polarization,</v>

2424
01:46:15.770 --> 01:46:20.770
<v Speaker 3>and if enough people decided that the going to me awake then</v>

2425
01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:24.950
<v Speaker 3>knows can be,</v>

2426
01:46:25.250 --> 01:46:29.420
<v Speaker 3>but we get rid of the whole thing gone wrong ourselves and have done that many</v>

2427
01:46:29.421 --> 01:46:30.410
<v Speaker 3>times in the past.</v>

2428
01:46:31.100 --> 01:46:31.933
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

2429
01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:36.193
<v Speaker 3>let's see.</v>

2430
01:46:37.620 --> 01:46:42.380
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

2431
01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:46.590
<v Speaker 3>How do you help someone who's too afraid and a,</v>

2432
01:46:46.820 --> 01:46:48.210
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

2433
01:46:51.590 --> 01:46:54.840
<v Speaker 3>it's the same people ask me to help someone.</v>

2434
01:46:56.670 --> 01:46:57.503
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2435
01:46:57.540 --> 01:47:01.350
<v Speaker 3>first of quit helping them because you're working,</v>

2436
01:47:01.351 --> 01:47:06.180
<v Speaker 3>so you have to launch and see it in the viewer attempts to help are not working.</v>

2437
01:47:06.180 --> 01:47:07.400
<v Speaker 3>Then the not wanting to do this,</v>

2438
01:47:07.570 --> 01:47:12.570
<v Speaker 3>the right time for her to get her to detached yourself with grace and with</v>

2439
01:47:12.931 --> 01:47:14.250
<v Speaker 3>compassion with the tennis.</v>

2440
01:47:14.390 --> 01:47:15.480
<v Speaker 3>But then you sit back,</v>

2441
01:47:15.570 --> 01:47:20.340
<v Speaker 3>watch all watched and merge the patient.</v>

2442
01:47:20.790 --> 01:47:21.650
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2443
01:47:22.110 --> 01:47:24.750
<v Speaker 3>but in the meantime was definitely more powerful.</v>

2444
01:47:24.751 --> 01:47:25.584
<v Speaker 3>An example,</v>

2445
01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:29.940
<v Speaker 3>if you want to change someone who doesn't want to be changed the best way to do</v>

2446
01:47:30.330 --> 01:47:31.163
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>

2447
01:47:31.590 --> 01:47:33.990
<v Speaker 3>here's the better way to do anything by example.</v>

2448
01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:36.540
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>

2449
01:47:38.020 --> 01:47:39.960
<v Speaker 3>you want to be an example to yourself too.</v>

2450
01:47:40.010 --> 01:47:40.830
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2451
01:47:40.830 --> 01:47:41.850
<v Speaker 3>because why not?</v>

2452
01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:46.440
<v Speaker 3>So the thing that I've learned about me and good person,</v>

2453
01:47:46.441 --> 01:47:46.831
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

2454
01:47:46.831 --> 01:47:48.840
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not claiming that I'm a good person,</v>

2455
01:47:48.841 --> 01:47:49.674
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

2456
01:47:51.150 --> 01:47:52.260
<v Speaker 3>there isn't a banner,</v>

2457
01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:53.730
<v Speaker 3>there is better England.</v>

2458
01:47:54.270 --> 01:47:57.120
<v Speaker 3>There isn't anything that's more adventurous than you possibly do,</v>

2459
01:47:57.121 --> 01:48:01.240
<v Speaker 3>that it really gives your life a depth.</v>

2460
01:48:01.510 --> 01:48:02.690
<v Speaker 3>It's almost,</v>

2461
01:48:02.890 --> 01:48:04.690
<v Speaker 3>it's an exhaustible and reuse things.</v>

2462
01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:08.880
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's a lot of things out there that can be putting in an order and</v>

2463
01:48:08.910 --> 01:48:10.230
<v Speaker 3>you can put some of them in order.</v>

2464
01:48:10.231 --> 01:48:10.740
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2465
01:48:10.740 --> 01:48:11.550
<v Speaker 3>how much is that?</v>

2466
01:48:11.550 --> 01:48:12.383
<v Speaker 3>Can you do?</v>

2467
01:48:12.660 --> 01:48:13.493
<v Speaker 3>Who knows what?</v>

2468
01:48:13.560 --> 01:48:15.270
<v Speaker 3>What you can do if you put your mind into it.</v>

2469
01:48:15.420 --> 01:48:20.010
<v Speaker 3>It's so fun because I see these young young people come up to me and they said,</v>

2470
01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:20.251
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2471
01:48:20.251 --> 01:48:25.040
<v Speaker 3>I've really started to apply myself state university and I are going to need it</v>

2472
01:48:25.410 --> 01:48:26.920
<v Speaker 3>and I'm starting to apply myself.</v>

2473
01:48:26.940 --> 01:48:30.330
<v Speaker 3>I think tell them it's like great and guard yourself.</v>

2474
01:48:30.450 --> 01:48:31.360
<v Speaker 3>Half put together.</v>

2475
01:48:31.361 --> 01:48:31.981
<v Speaker 3>You're 21.</v>

2476
01:48:31.981 --> 01:48:34.350
<v Speaker 3>It's like he could be dead by the time you're 30.</v>

2477
01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:36.740
<v Speaker 3>You can just be fixing things like map.</v>

2478
01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:38.970
<v Speaker 3>You can be competent in 10 different domains.</v>

2479
01:48:39.390 --> 01:48:39.870
<v Speaker 3>BBS,</v>

2480
01:48:39.870 --> 01:48:41.040
<v Speaker 3>force of nature.</v>

2481
01:48:41.280 --> 01:48:41.960
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2482
01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:42.650
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2483
01:48:42.650 --> 01:48:43.920
<v Speaker 3>there is an ambition.</v>

2484
01:48:43.980 --> 01:48:46.170
<v Speaker 3>That's what we should be teaching our young people.</v>

2485
01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:49.820
<v Speaker 3>It's like make yourself so competent that you would just terrify,</v>

2486
01:48:50.130 --> 01:48:54.270
<v Speaker 3>get the hell out there doing everything you possibly can to make things better</v>

2487
01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:56.820
<v Speaker 3>before the complain about the structure for world.</v>

2488
01:48:57.330 --> 01:48:57.541
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

2489
01:48:57.541 --> 01:48:58.500
<v Speaker 3>and they're so happy.</v>

2490
01:48:58.501 --> 01:49:03.501
<v Speaker 3>You tell the kids that they just smiling away site because that's what they want</v>

2491
01:49:03.841 --> 01:49:04.674
<v Speaker 3>to hear this.</v>

2492
01:49:05.010 --> 01:49:06.150
<v Speaker 3>They want a pat on the back,</v>

2493
01:49:06.180 --> 01:49:09.060
<v Speaker 3>not because of what they've already accomplished with because they're on the</v>

2494
01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:13.090
<v Speaker 3>path to something greater and it's just vigorous.</v>

2495
01:49:13.690 --> 01:49:14.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm wondering,</v>

2496
01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:17.140
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that's so fun about all this is on the lead executive for</v>

2497
01:49:17.141 --> 01:49:20.060
<v Speaker 3>people because there's thousands and thousands of letting you know,</v>

2498
01:49:20.070 --> 01:49:21.210
<v Speaker 3>they say the same thing.</v>

2499
01:49:21.211 --> 01:49:23.330
<v Speaker 3>It's like doing my best said,</v>

2500
01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:29.000
<v Speaker 3>put my foot forward and to step forth into the world and to tell the truth and</v>

2501
01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:35.790
<v Speaker 3>reporting in on getting along with my girlfriend or my boyfriend.</v>

2502
01:49:35.800 --> 01:49:37.560
<v Speaker 3>The getting along better with my parents.</v>

2503
01:49:37.561 --> 01:49:41.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing good at school and you know,</v>

2504
01:49:41.100 --> 01:49:41.890
<v Speaker 3>here's a bunch of.</v>

2505
01:49:41.890 --> 01:49:42.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm excited.</v>

2506
01:49:42.610 --> 01:49:44.850
<v Speaker 3>Dropped and cycling man.</v>

2507
01:49:45.270 --> 01:49:47.010
<v Speaker 3>Come forward and see what.</v>

2508
01:49:47.290 --> 01:49:48.123
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2509
01:49:48.250 --> 01:49:49.420
<v Speaker 3>it's so good.</v>

2510
01:49:49.870 --> 01:49:50.703
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

2511
01:49:53.280 --> 01:49:58.280
<v Speaker 3>thank</v>

2512
01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:05.460
<v Speaker 3>stress surrounding the problem that is out of your control</v>

2513
01:50:12.700 --> 01:50:13.490
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

2514
01:50:13.490 --> 01:50:18.490
<v Speaker 3>I've had problems for a long time now for the last 10 years and my daughter is</v>

2515
01:50:19.481 --> 01:50:21.550
<v Speaker 3>just unbelievably sick.</v>

2516
01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:23.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm worried about that.</v>

2517
01:50:23.201 --> 01:50:24.070
<v Speaker 3>Chapter 12,</v>

2518
01:50:24.100 --> 01:50:24.933
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2519
01:50:26.680 --> 01:50:28.030
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you just don't,</v>

2520
01:50:28.060 --> 01:50:28.893
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2521
01:50:29.270 --> 01:50:31.600
<v Speaker 3>and that's part of the catastrophe in life.</v>

2522
01:50:32.090 --> 01:50:32.380
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2523
01:50:32.380 --> 01:50:35.500
<v Speaker 3>some people get panchromatic counselor and they're done.</v>

2524
01:50:35.501 --> 01:50:36.580
<v Speaker 3>They're done in six months.</v>

2525
01:50:36.581 --> 01:50:41.581
<v Speaker 3>Then all the heroes in the world is going to save them from a particular faith</v>

2526
01:50:43.130 --> 01:50:44.260
<v Speaker 3>is heroic idea,</v>

2527
01:50:44.261 --> 01:50:45.094
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2528
01:50:45.230 --> 01:50:45.670
<v Speaker 3>need,</v>

2529
01:50:45.670 --> 01:50:47.440
<v Speaker 3>despite the best of your life,</v>

2530
01:50:47.760 --> 01:50:50.920
<v Speaker 3>it's your best back by any stretch of the imagination.</v>

2531
01:50:50.921 --> 01:50:55.600
<v Speaker 3>It's also the best approach you how to actually fixing the catastrophe,</v>

2532
01:50:55.660 --> 01:50:57.250
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2533
01:50:57.650 --> 01:51:01.750
<v Speaker 3>still bounded by your mortality and your and your insufficiency.</v>

2534
01:51:03.190 --> 01:51:05.700
<v Speaker 3>If you really take care of your sick.</v>

2535
01:51:05.900 --> 01:51:08.410
<v Speaker 3>Part of what you have to do is shrink your timeframe.</v>

2536
01:51:10.090 --> 01:51:15.090
<v Speaker 3>When we were dealing with landowners and she was well on the way to parishes and</v>

2537
01:51:16.330 --> 01:51:17.680
<v Speaker 3>in the very painful manner,</v>

2538
01:51:18.050 --> 01:51:18.883
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2539
01:51:19.980 --> 01:51:22.140
<v Speaker 3>you don't think about a week from now,</v>

2540
01:51:22.170 --> 01:51:23.610
<v Speaker 3>a month from now or a year from now,</v>

2541
01:51:23.630 --> 01:51:26.420
<v Speaker 3>you think about today and you think,</v>

2542
01:51:26.440 --> 01:51:26.741
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2543
01:51:26.741 --> 01:51:26.951
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2544
01:51:26.951 --> 01:51:28.840
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to make today's lit as I can make.</v>

2545
01:51:29.380 --> 01:51:31.110
<v Speaker 3>And then sometimes you don't think about today.</v>

2546
01:51:31.111 --> 01:51:35.980
<v Speaker 3>You think about the next morning and sometimes you can lead you to think about</v>

2547
01:51:35.981 --> 01:51:36.300
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2548
01:51:36.300 --> 01:51:39.040
<v Speaker 3>You get to the next hour or maybe the next minute,</v>

2549
01:51:40.060 --> 01:51:41.240
<v Speaker 3>someone's deathbed,</v>

2550
01:51:41.970 --> 01:51:42.970
<v Speaker 3>it's the next minute,</v>

2551
01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:43.833
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2552
01:51:43.870 --> 01:51:47.710
<v Speaker 3>and what you do is try to make that the least amount of horrible it can possibly</v>

2553
01:51:47.711 --> 01:51:49.720
<v Speaker 3>be and that this really matters.</v>

2554
01:51:50.410 --> 01:51:51.670
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that struck me,</v>

2555
01:51:51.671 --> 01:51:52.504
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

2556
01:51:52.660 --> 01:51:54.460
<v Speaker 3>I was around,</v>

2557
01:51:55.060 --> 01:51:58.090
<v Speaker 3>my mother belonged to Steph and she had,</v>

2558
01:51:58.180 --> 01:51:58.691
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

2559
01:51:58.691 --> 01:51:59.201
<v Speaker 3>dimension,</v>

2560
01:51:59.201 --> 01:52:04.201
<v Speaker 3>which is a particularly nasty way to go and it took her quite a long time to in</v>

2561
01:52:05.620 --> 01:52:06.830
<v Speaker 3>the final throws,</v>

2562
01:52:06.890 --> 01:52:07.723
<v Speaker 3>the realness.</v>

2563
01:52:08.940 --> 01:52:11.770
<v Speaker 3>It's rough to be in a situation like that.</v>

2564
01:52:11.970 --> 01:52:16.060
<v Speaker 3>I guess the person that everyone loves us to Sharon with the former self and a</v>

2565
01:52:16.061 --> 01:52:18.850
<v Speaker 3>skeletal without the family old,</v>

2566
01:52:18.851 --> 01:52:19.684
<v Speaker 3>their.</v>

2567
01:52:19.750 --> 01:52:21.450
<v Speaker 3>The person's in an agony,</v>

2568
01:52:21.451 --> 01:52:21.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2569
01:52:21.700 --> 01:52:23.620
<v Speaker 3>because dieting a snuff for the week,</v>

2570
01:52:23.621 --> 01:52:24.520
<v Speaker 3>that's for sure.</v>

2571
01:52:25.950 --> 01:52:27.880
<v Speaker 3>But my sisters,</v>

2572
01:52:28.260 --> 01:52:31.010
<v Speaker 3>my wife's family are quite an admirable law.</v>

2573
01:52:31.690 --> 01:52:35.140
<v Speaker 3>My wife was statistic value term work and his work as a social therapist and</v>

2574
01:52:35.141 --> 01:52:39.940
<v Speaker 3>she's a tough cookie and her sister is a palliative care nurse and her other</v>

2575
01:52:39.941 --> 01:52:44.540
<v Speaker 3>sister was a pharmacist and they're pretty sensible as a family and you know,</v>

2576
01:52:44.590 --> 01:52:49.590
<v Speaker 3>they all around the monitors with their father.</v>

2577
01:52:51.990 --> 01:52:53.000
<v Speaker 3>The beginning,</v>

2578
01:52:53.090 --> 01:52:53.530
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

2579
01:52:53.530 --> 01:52:54.740
<v Speaker 3>it only pulled together.</v>

2580
01:52:55.220 --> 01:52:58.730
<v Speaker 3>They didn't fight when she was dying.</v>

2581
01:52:59.510 --> 01:53:03.770
<v Speaker 3>They called together and when I saw half,</v>

2582
01:53:03.790 --> 01:53:05.320
<v Speaker 3>of course it turned.</v>

2583
01:53:05.321 --> 01:53:10.321
<v Speaker 3>The situation that was determining tragic into was it had something knowable,</v>

2584
01:53:11.170 --> 01:53:15.470
<v Speaker 3>love it to spray this catastrophe and certainly didn't deep generated into a</v>

2585
01:53:15.471 --> 01:53:17.060
<v Speaker 3>squabbling hell,</v>

2586
01:53:17.061 --> 01:53:18.430
<v Speaker 3>which could have easily happened.</v>

2587
01:53:19.310 --> 01:53:21.050
<v Speaker 3>They actually gained something from it.</v>

2588
01:53:21.540 --> 01:53:26.540
<v Speaker 3>I think the family became closer afterwards because of what they had gone</v>

2589
01:53:27.411 --> 01:53:29.410
<v Speaker 3>through and their mother was closed,</v>

2590
01:53:29.411 --> 01:53:32.710
<v Speaker 3>but they all know along better after that,</v>

2591
01:53:33.020 --> 01:53:38.020
<v Speaker 3>and they were all closer to the father was an absolute star during his wife</v>

2592
01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:39.130
<v Speaker 3>sale.</v>

2593
01:53:39.130 --> 01:53:40.740
<v Speaker 3>He was isn't interest to God.</v>

2594
01:53:40.741 --> 01:53:41.574
<v Speaker 3>He's still alive.</v>

2595
01:53:41.690 --> 01:53:42.080
<v Speaker 3>Stickiness.</v>

2596
01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:47.080
<v Speaker 3>Tell Robertson he was he money knew of in this little town I grew up in is</v>

2597
01:53:47.870 --> 01:53:50.420
<v Speaker 3>unbelievably extroverted in a comical guy.</v>

2598
01:53:50.510 --> 01:53:53.120
<v Speaker 3>Tended to drink too much and he was the wife of the party.</v>

2599
01:53:53.390 --> 01:53:54.410
<v Speaker 3>Loud guy.</v>

2600
01:53:54.470 --> 01:53:59.430
<v Speaker 3>I gave a far more labor t shirt for Christmas one year and she proudly.</v>

2601
01:54:00.070 --> 01:54:01.790
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of a party animal,</v>

2602
01:54:01.940 --> 01:54:03.820
<v Speaker 3>but I'm also very solid manner.</v>

2603
01:54:03.860 --> 01:54:05.470
<v Speaker 3>I really liked him and respected him.</v>

2604
01:54:05.900 --> 01:54:07.310
<v Speaker 3>God and his wife got sick.</v>

2605
01:54:07.311 --> 01:54:07.910
<v Speaker 3>He was.</v>

2606
01:54:07.910 --> 01:54:12.910
<v Speaker 3>He was something else that he took care of her like patiently and every time</v>

2607
01:54:13.401 --> 01:54:14.490
<v Speaker 3>someone offered to help them,</v>

2608
01:54:14.491 --> 01:54:15.360
<v Speaker 3>he thought it would help me,</v>

2609
01:54:15.370 --> 01:54:20.370
<v Speaker 3>took the hill and he was happy that he garnered the respect of his children in a</v>

2610
01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:24.860
<v Speaker 3>really profound way and so well.</v>

2611
01:54:24.861 --> 01:54:27.170
<v Speaker 3>So what can you do in a terrible situation?</v>

2612
01:54:27.171 --> 01:54:28.004
<v Speaker 3>This you can.</v>

2613
01:54:28.190 --> 01:54:29.740
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to say it lightly,</v>

2614
01:54:29.780 --> 01:54:30.830
<v Speaker 3>to make the best of it.</v>

2615
01:54:30.860 --> 01:54:34.940
<v Speaker 3>You know you could stop it from degenerating into absolute hell.</v>

2616
01:54:35.210 --> 01:54:37.600
<v Speaker 3>You can do everything he can to stave that off the partner.</v>

2617
01:54:37.601 --> 01:54:39.470
<v Speaker 3>You do that by narrowing your timeframe.</v>

2618
01:54:39.770 --> 01:54:40.603
<v Speaker 3>It's like if,</v>

2619
01:54:40.670 --> 01:54:44.170
<v Speaker 3>if the week is too much that it's today and if the day is too much debt is to</v>

2620
01:54:44.171 --> 01:54:45.800
<v Speaker 3>our hours too much,</v>

2621
01:54:46.070 --> 01:54:48.200
<v Speaker 3>then it's the minute you think,</v>

2622
01:54:48.380 --> 01:54:48.651
<v Speaker 3>well hell,</v>

2623
01:54:48.651 --> 01:54:50.210
<v Speaker 3>I have to get through this next minute.</v>

2624
01:54:50.211 --> 01:54:52.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do it the best I can,</v>

2625
01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:56.570
<v Speaker 3>and then it's the next minute that sometimes that's going to go up that shoulder</v>

2626
01:54:56.571 --> 01:54:57.590
<v Speaker 3>against the wheel.</v>

2627
01:54:57.640 --> 01:55:02.640
<v Speaker 3>Brutal uphill struggle and hopefully you can do it as normally as you can manage</v>

2628
01:55:05.990 --> 01:55:06.823
<v Speaker 3>and that's.</v>

2629
01:55:07.030 --> 01:55:10.400
<v Speaker 3>That's the best you have in some situations and it's a hell of a lot better than</v>

2630
01:55:10.401 --> 01:55:11.234
<v Speaker 3>the alternative.</v>

2631
01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:18.160
<v Speaker 3>Thanks a ton of great stuff here.</v>

2632
01:55:22.051 --> 01:55:24.020
<v Speaker 3>So I'm just sort of randomly jumping around.</v>

2633
01:55:24.260 --> 01:55:25.093
<v Speaker 3>I love this one.</v>

2634
01:55:25.240 --> 01:55:27.080
<v Speaker 3>How you find your passion.</v>

2635
01:55:37.340 --> 01:55:38.930
<v Speaker 3>Well look,</v>

2636
01:55:39.800 --> 01:55:40.101
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2637
01:55:40.101 --> 01:55:42.890
<v Speaker 3>everybody has a problem and you might.</v>

2638
01:55:43.500 --> 01:55:44.370
<v Speaker 3>That's terrible.</v>

2639
01:55:47.990 --> 01:55:48.420
<v Speaker 3>You don't.</v>

2640
01:55:48.420 --> 01:55:50.340
<v Speaker 3>When you think about all the problems in the world,</v>

2641
01:55:50.670 --> 01:55:55.670
<v Speaker 3>there's walkable kind of all your problems and then we can tell that some of</v>

2642
01:55:56.291 --> 01:55:57.124
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

2643
01:55:57.890 --> 01:55:59.190
<v Speaker 3>even though there are problems,</v>

2644
01:55:59.220 --> 01:55:59.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2645
01:55:59.820 --> 01:56:03.720
<v Speaker 3>maybe their problem if you work with other people are politically,</v>

2646
01:56:03.810 --> 01:56:05.940
<v Speaker 3>they don't bug you have some problems,</v>

2647
01:56:05.941 --> 01:56:06.774
<v Speaker 3>but you.</v>

2648
01:56:07.400 --> 01:56:11.640
<v Speaker 3>And if those are your problems and so you sort of find your destiny in your</v>

2649
01:56:11.641 --> 01:56:12.211
<v Speaker 3>problems,</v>

2650
01:56:12.211 --> 01:56:13.980
<v Speaker 3>I would say something bought you,</v>

2651
01:56:14.970 --> 01:56:15.803
<v Speaker 3>fix it.</v>

2652
01:56:16.490 --> 01:56:17.520
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2653
01:56:17.750 --> 01:56:20.040
<v Speaker 3>maybe you want to pick the right sized problem.</v>

2654
01:56:20.190 --> 01:56:20.730
<v Speaker 3>Don't,</v>

2655
01:56:20.730 --> 01:56:24.720
<v Speaker 3>don't get all Arabic trying to fix something you don't know how to fix.</v>

2656
01:56:25.140 --> 01:56:27.190
<v Speaker 3>But if something's been see you,</v>

2657
01:56:27.370 --> 01:56:29.130
<v Speaker 3>well that's your problem.</v>

2658
01:56:29.220 --> 01:56:30.280
<v Speaker 3>And then there's,</v>

2659
01:56:30.390 --> 01:56:32.490
<v Speaker 3>that's your destiny will fix that problem.</v>

2660
01:56:32.670 --> 01:56:35.600
<v Speaker 3>And we can do this in local environments.</v>

2661
01:56:36.150 --> 01:56:37.410
<v Speaker 3>You can go to the room.</v>

2662
01:56:38.580 --> 01:56:41.400
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of funny that this whole clean your room thing is become a thing.</v>

2663
01:56:41.401 --> 01:56:42.234
<v Speaker 3>I mean</v>

2664
01:56:43.530 --> 01:56:45.060
<v Speaker 3>there's a reason for that is because it's.</v>

2665
01:56:45.080 --> 01:56:45.280
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2666
01:56:45.280 --> 01:56:48.700
<v Speaker 3>it's humbled in the right way that he's not that easy to clean around matching,</v>

2667
01:56:48.720 --> 01:56:52.680
<v Speaker 3>especially if you live in a really dysfunctional family because if you live in a</v>

2668
01:56:52.681 --> 01:56:54.060
<v Speaker 3>really dysfunctional family,</v>

2669
01:56:54.360 --> 01:56:58.980
<v Speaker 3>they will get really angry at you when you start to do things right and then</v>

2670
01:56:59.030 --> 01:57:00.390
<v Speaker 3>then you're in a battle that,</v>

2671
01:57:00.450 --> 01:57:02.170
<v Speaker 3>and that might be as simple as male.</v>

2672
01:57:02.250 --> 01:57:06.900
<v Speaker 3>Do you think you are when you're doing something like trying to remove some of</v>

2673
01:57:06.901 --> 01:57:10.680
<v Speaker 3>the grime and the catastrophe that happens to be part of your living space?</v>

2674
01:57:10.681 --> 01:57:10.870
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2675
01:57:10.870 --> 01:57:13.470
<v Speaker 3>because just by taking a step in the right direction,</v>

2676
01:57:13.471 --> 01:57:17.430
<v Speaker 3>you shoved in dim light on everyone who's groping around in the dirt,</v>

2677
01:57:17.460 --> 01:57:18.720
<v Speaker 3>trying to make things worse,</v>

2678
01:57:18.721 --> 01:57:22.230
<v Speaker 3>and so trying to clean up the room to be a real metaphysical battle.</v>

2679
01:57:22.310 --> 01:57:23.101
<v Speaker 3>The camp,</v>

2680
01:57:23.101 --> 01:57:25.170
<v Speaker 3>because the room is a microcosm,</v>

2681
01:57:25.230 --> 01:57:26.063
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2682
01:57:26.110 --> 01:57:26.821
<v Speaker 3>it's also,</v>

2683
01:57:26.821 --> 01:57:30.420
<v Speaker 3>they're part of reality that you have a grip on that you could set,</v>

2684
01:57:30.430 --> 01:57:30.850
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2685
01:57:30.850 --> 01:57:35.330
<v Speaker 3>You could learn how to live with him and it's the right level of humility that</v>

2686
01:57:35.640 --> 01:57:37.300
<v Speaker 3>you might be able to clean up your room.</v>

2687
01:57:37.330 --> 01:57:38.610
<v Speaker 3>You might be able to send in an order.</v>

2688
01:57:38.611 --> 01:57:40.470
<v Speaker 3>You might even be able to make it beautiful.</v>

2689
01:57:40.710 --> 01:57:42.030
<v Speaker 3>If you've got an ambitious,</v>

2690
01:57:42.120 --> 01:57:44.700
<v Speaker 3>you know you can make the little place that you have control over.</v>

2691
01:57:44.760 --> 01:57:45.450
<v Speaker 3>Beautiful.</v>

2692
01:57:45.450 --> 01:57:50.450
<v Speaker 3>That's a real difficult thing to manage and so now I've got an question.</v>

2693
01:57:53.220 --> 01:57:54.053
<v Speaker 3>That question</v>

2694
01:57:57.960 --> 01:58:00.490
<v Speaker 3>that you should take,</v>

2695
01:58:01.930 --> 01:58:02.763
<v Speaker 3>you should take.</v>

2696
01:58:02.880 --> 01:58:06.290
<v Speaker 3>You should take your problem with seriously because you know me.</v>

2697
01:58:06.340 --> 01:58:07.600
<v Speaker 3>Branded stories.</v>

2698
01:58:08.880 --> 01:58:13.000
<v Speaker 3>Abraham in particular is called by the adventure of his life.</v>

2699
01:58:13.001 --> 01:58:17.360
<v Speaker 3>Not only does encounter trouble like storage are so comical because garden</v>

2700
01:58:17.361 --> 01:58:21.640
<v Speaker 3>basically tells him to get up entrepreneurs gas in it and he's been hanging</v>

2701
01:58:21.660 --> 01:58:25.230
<v Speaker 3>around as far as camp for way too long goes out into the world and there's</v>

2702
01:58:25.231 --> 01:58:26.480
<v Speaker 3>nothing about a catastrophe.</v>

2703
01:58:26.490 --> 01:58:30.810
<v Speaker 3>The younger parents like would it be better to stay at home and the 10th that's,</v>

2704
01:58:30.870 --> 01:58:31.703
<v Speaker 3>that's not.</v>

2705
01:58:31.710 --> 01:58:35.130
<v Speaker 3>It's not right because it's like the problems in your life or here are the</v>

2706
01:58:35.131 --> 01:58:39.180
<v Speaker 3>portal to your great advantage of like the question with the high school teacher</v>

2707
01:58:39.590 --> 01:58:40.410
<v Speaker 3>after a cycle,</v>

2708
01:58:40.410 --> 01:58:41.660
<v Speaker 3>how do I stand up against?</v>

2709
01:58:41.700 --> 01:58:43.070
<v Speaker 3>It's just like exactly.</v>

2710
01:58:43.920 --> 01:58:48.920
<v Speaker 3>You're in position of the potential mythological hero who has handled through</v>

2711
01:58:48.970 --> 01:58:50.770
<v Speaker 3>the tire was sea of clay.</v>

2712
01:58:51.130 --> 01:58:51.401
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2713
01:58:51.401 --> 01:58:52.480
<v Speaker 3>how do you do that?</v>

2714
01:58:52.540 --> 01:58:55.390
<v Speaker 3>You transform yourself into warrior.</v>

2715
01:58:55.720 --> 01:58:56.720
<v Speaker 3>That's how you do it,</v>

2716
01:58:56.950 --> 01:58:58.960
<v Speaker 3>and then that changes everything about you.</v>

2717
01:58:58.961 --> 01:58:59.321
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2718
01:58:59.321 --> 01:58:59.501
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2719
01:58:59.501 --> 01:59:01.030
<v Speaker 3>it's terrible that I have this wrong.</v>

2720
01:59:01.050 --> 01:59:01.660
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2721
01:59:01.660 --> 01:59:02.021
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2722
01:59:02.021 --> 01:59:02.851
<v Speaker 3>it is terrible,</v>

2723
01:59:02.851 --> 01:59:07.851
<v Speaker 3>but it's also the greatest thing that can happen to you and so look and see what</v>

2724
01:59:08.681 --> 01:59:13.681
<v Speaker 3>your problems are and then off that set of things that manifest themselves as</v>

2725
01:59:13.840 --> 01:59:14.920
<v Speaker 3>your promos.</v>

2726
01:59:15.160 --> 01:59:20.160
<v Speaker 3>Look for the smaller subset of things that you can fix and start fixing them and</v>

2727
01:59:20.550 --> 01:59:24.130
<v Speaker 3>you'll get better and better and better app and then who knows where you'll end</v>

2728
01:59:24.131 --> 01:59:26.560
<v Speaker 3>up and then you will find yourself that way.</v>

2729
01:59:27.150 --> 01:59:29.530
<v Speaker 3>And so it's kind of painful,</v>

2730
01:59:29.531 --> 01:59:29.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2731
01:59:29.860 --> 01:59:31.750
<v Speaker 3>because you have to pick up the problems,</v>

2732
01:59:31.751 --> 01:59:33.790
<v Speaker 3>but don't be so sure if you want to have.</v>

2733
01:59:33.970 --> 01:59:36.490
<v Speaker 3>Get almost like that would be very interesting.</v>

2734
01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:41.230
<v Speaker 3>So maybe whatever compelling problem that grips you completely.</v>

2735
01:59:41.750 --> 01:59:42.400
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2736
01:59:42.400 --> 01:59:43.960
<v Speaker 3>you could probably find one of those,</v>

2737
01:59:44.290 --> 01:59:46.420
<v Speaker 3>so that's what I would recommend</v>

2738
01:59:48.270 --> 01:59:48.991
<v Speaker 3>and be humble.</v>

2739
01:59:48.991 --> 01:59:52.390
<v Speaker 3>Like you don't maybe want me some little trivial things you can fix.</v>

2740
01:59:52.480 --> 01:59:53.890
<v Speaker 3>Well that's probably all you're good for.</v>

2741
01:59:53.891 --> 01:59:54.724
<v Speaker 3>Anyways.</v>

2742
01:59:58.300 --> 01:59:59.920
<v Speaker 3>Your job go well,</v>

2743
01:59:59.980 --> 02:00:00.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm fine.</v>

2744
02:00:00.800 --> 02:00:04.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm a little better at this than I might've made it so that maybe you could try</v>

2745
02:00:04.760 --> 02:00:05.700
<v Speaker 3>like a medium sized,</v>

2746
02:00:06.740 --> 02:00:08.490
<v Speaker 3>but Carl Jung said,</v>

2747
02:00:08.500 --> 02:00:09.490
<v Speaker 3>monitor people don't see,</v>

2748
02:00:10.110 --> 02:00:11.320
<v Speaker 3>don't look low enough.</v>

2749
02:00:11.740 --> 02:00:12.580
<v Speaker 3>I love that.</v>

2750
02:00:12.610 --> 02:00:13.690
<v Speaker 3>He's so smart.</v>

2751
02:00:13.870 --> 02:00:14.550
<v Speaker 3>Terrifying,</v>

2752
02:00:14.550 --> 02:00:15.383
<v Speaker 3>but smart.</v>

2753
02:00:15.670 --> 02:00:17.020
<v Speaker 3>But that's a lovely idea.</v>

2754
02:00:17.021 --> 02:00:19.420
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's something out there going for you.</v>

2755
02:00:19.460 --> 02:00:22.570
<v Speaker 3>You're too damn hurricane to bargain with it because you think you're above it.</v>

2756
02:00:22.780 --> 02:00:24.880
<v Speaker 3>You're not humble,</v>

2757
02:00:25.210 --> 02:00:27.160
<v Speaker 3>so down on your knees,</v>

2758
02:00:27.161 --> 02:00:27.851
<v Speaker 3>so to speak.</v>

2759
02:00:27.851 --> 02:00:32.710
<v Speaker 3>He looked for the parole is small enough so that you're the right size warrior.</v>

2760
02:00:32.770 --> 02:00:35.500
<v Speaker 3>Combat that particular tiny dragons and you think,</v>

2761
02:00:35.501 --> 02:00:36.550
<v Speaker 3>well that was pretty pathetic.</v>

2762
02:00:36.551 --> 02:00:36.881
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2763
02:00:36.881 --> 02:00:37.170
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2764
02:00:37.170 --> 02:00:38.040
<v Speaker 3>it was to begin with,</v>

2765
02:00:38.110 --> 02:00:39.220
<v Speaker 3>but not for all.</v>

2766
02:00:39.730 --> 02:00:40.563
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

2767
02:00:42.260 --> 02:00:47.260
<v Speaker 3>thank you.</v>

2768
02:00:49.750 --> 02:00:50.583
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

2769
02:00:51.140 --> 02:00:53.230
<v Speaker 3>what would you say were streaming?</v>

2770
02:00:57.130 --> 02:00:58.400
<v Speaker 3>What would I say that Arla?</v>

2771
02:00:58.750 --> 02:00:59.050
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2772
02:00:59.050 --> 02:01:00.350
<v Speaker 3>if you say to them,</v>

2773
02:01:00.520 --> 02:01:01.353
<v Speaker 3>if they,</v>

2774
02:01:01.640 --> 02:01:04.020
<v Speaker 3>you have some followers that believe in things,</v>

2775
02:01:04.470 --> 02:01:06.480
<v Speaker 3>you don't believe that extremism.</v>

2776
02:01:06.870 --> 02:01:08.830
<v Speaker 3>So I think if there are people,</v>

2777
02:01:09.370 --> 02:01:10.580
<v Speaker 3>there are people with like,</v>

2778
02:01:11.430 --> 02:01:12.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2779
02:01:12.010 --> 02:01:12.843
<v Speaker 3>the search</v>

2780
02:01:14.850 --> 02:01:16.720
<v Speaker 3>that we find old reasonably regardless,</v>

2781
02:01:16.721 --> 02:01:19.810
<v Speaker 3>recognizable thing that I have an Avatar for their viewpoint.</v>

2782
02:01:19.811 --> 02:01:20.860
<v Speaker 3>They're not my followers.</v>

2783
02:01:20.861 --> 02:01:24.750
<v Speaker 3>They just repeat to take the paid understand why it might be because we have</v>

2784
02:01:24.760 --> 02:01:28.690
<v Speaker 3>some casual acquaintance with the fact that I've criticized the radical left.</v>

2785
02:01:29.110 --> 02:01:29.943
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2786
02:01:30.780 --> 02:01:31.613
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2787
02:01:33.690 --> 02:01:36.310
<v Speaker 3>I'd be lecturing about the same things for 30 years.</v>

2788
02:01:37.410 --> 02:01:38.330
<v Speaker 3>One hundred one.</v>

2789
02:01:38.350 --> 02:01:40.500
<v Speaker 3>Have I been telling if you want to,</v>

2790
02:01:40.501 --> 02:01:42.840
<v Speaker 3>Nazi Germany can probably be anoxic.</v>

2791
02:01:44.290 --> 02:01:44.700
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2792
02:01:44.700 --> 02:01:48.260
<v Speaker 3>I spend about 30 hours trying to convince my students that that's the truth.</v>

2793
02:01:48.450 --> 02:01:50.000
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's a bitter bloody truth.</v>

2794
02:01:50.550 --> 02:01:51.220
<v Speaker 3>What are you going to do?</v>

2795
02:01:51.220 --> 02:01:54.950
<v Speaker 3>You're going to take that as a message to transform that into some political</v>

2796
02:01:54.951 --> 02:01:57.380
<v Speaker 3>crusade that's going to make you feel like it all right?</v>

2797
02:01:57.380 --> 02:01:58.213
<v Speaker 3>If your own.</v>

2798
02:01:58.460 --> 02:02:00.940
<v Speaker 3>Because he admitted that and you understand what that means.</v>

2799
02:02:00.950 --> 02:02:05.950
<v Speaker 3>To admit that if he would have been announcing it's occurring in a phone me and</v>

2800
02:02:06.080 --> 02:02:11.080
<v Speaker 3>have that as the best can make that some sort of political tribalism and if you</v>

2801
02:02:11.151 --> 02:02:11.984
<v Speaker 3>don't get,</v>

2802
02:02:12.550 --> 02:02:14.690
<v Speaker 3>if you don't get that core message,</v>

2803
02:02:14.780 --> 02:02:17.260
<v Speaker 3>you know that the evil of the world resides with the video.</v>

2804
02:02:17.500 --> 02:02:19.010
<v Speaker 3>If you don't get that core message,</v>

2805
02:02:19.070 --> 02:02:23.270
<v Speaker 3>you haven't missed anything that are saying because that's certainly what I've</v>

2806
02:02:23.271 --> 02:02:24.104
<v Speaker 3>been saying.</v>

2807
02:02:24.140 --> 02:02:24.973
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2808
02:02:25.490 --> 02:02:27.610
<v Speaker 3>take on the burden of malevolence.</v>

2809
02:02:28.010 --> 02:02:33.010
<v Speaker 3>Don't project it on work and straighten yourself up because the world depends on</v>

2810
02:02:33.501 --> 02:02:34.334
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2811
02:02:34.390 --> 02:02:38.660
<v Speaker 3>It's like people can turn to make political hay out about the good luck man,</v>

2812
02:02:38.780 --> 02:02:39.700
<v Speaker 3>because that's just,</v>

2813
02:02:39.850 --> 02:02:43.560
<v Speaker 3>it's just not a story that transforms itself into the ideological wether easily.</v>

2814
02:02:44.540 --> 02:02:46.670
<v Speaker 3>So go back to those people.</v>

2815
02:02:46.671 --> 02:02:48.390
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I have followers on,</v>

2816
02:02:48.490 --> 02:02:48.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2817
02:02:48.800 --> 02:02:49.940
<v Speaker 3>I don't like that idea.</v>

2818
02:02:50.380 --> 02:02:51.560
<v Speaker 3>Never have followers.</v>

2819
02:02:51.561 --> 02:02:53.810
<v Speaker 3>It's like you don't have followers.</v>

2820
02:02:53.820 --> 02:02:55.120
<v Speaker 3>Please pick up your guard,</v>

2821
02:02:55.121 --> 02:02:56.930
<v Speaker 3>their burden and struggle up the hill.</v>

2822
02:02:57.770 --> 02:02:59.550
<v Speaker 3>I saw something that you have fall restore,</v>

2823
02:02:59.620 --> 02:03:00.453
<v Speaker 3>that's a cold.</v>

2824
02:03:00.540 --> 02:03:02.270
<v Speaker 3>Each person's individual destiny.</v>

2825
02:03:03.500 --> 02:03:04.360
<v Speaker 3>And that's not.</v>

2826
02:03:05.150 --> 02:03:07.210
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing in that for followers.</v>

2827
02:03:08.160 --> 02:03:08.993
<v Speaker 3>Like</v>

2828
02:03:12.790 --> 02:03:17.790
<v Speaker 3>thats last important.</v>

2829
02:03:20.840 --> 02:03:21.673
<v Speaker 3>Zach.</v>

2830
02:03:24.200 --> 02:03:24.650
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2831
02:03:24.650 --> 02:03:26.300
<v Speaker 3>but we achieve it.</v>

2832
02:03:26.750 --> 02:03:29.420
<v Speaker 3>You should forgive those who trespass against you.</v>

2833
02:03:29.550 --> 02:03:31.260
<v Speaker 3>It's like you haven't.</v>

2834
02:03:31.270 --> 02:03:32.600
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty hard to do that.</v>

2835
02:03:33.410 --> 02:03:35.980
<v Speaker 3>You don't do that just by waking up one morning and say,</v>

2836
02:03:35.990 --> 02:03:36.823
<v Speaker 3>I forgive you.</v>

2837
02:03:37.060 --> 02:03:37.893
<v Speaker 3>I forgive you.</v>

2838
02:03:41.030 --> 02:03:41.660
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>

2839
02:03:41.660 --> 02:03:43.590
<v Speaker 3>That's the part that hasn't</v>

2840
02:03:45.170 --> 02:03:46.150
<v Speaker 3>forgiven at all.</v>

2841
02:03:46.200 --> 02:03:47.033
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2842
02:03:47.210 --> 02:03:47.691
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

2843
02:03:47.691 --> 02:03:49.850
<v Speaker 3>you want to ask when you should forgive someone,</v>

2844
02:03:51.620 --> 02:03:52.453
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2845
02:03:54.590 --> 02:03:57.200
<v Speaker 3>Forgiveness is associated with repentance.</v>

2846
02:03:58.040 --> 02:04:00.470
<v Speaker 3>Now let's say that someone will be traded and seriously,</v>

2847
02:04:00.471 --> 02:04:02.090
<v Speaker 3>or even you'd be treated yourself.</v>

2848
02:04:02.091 --> 02:04:02.850
<v Speaker 3>Let's do that.</v>

2849
02:04:02.850 --> 02:04:03.860
<v Speaker 3>You betrayed yourself.</v>

2850
02:04:03.890 --> 02:04:04.723
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2851
02:04:05.120 --> 02:04:05.451
<v Speaker 3>you think,</v>

2852
02:04:05.451 --> 02:04:05.601
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2853
02:04:05.601 --> 02:04:06.740
<v Speaker 3>she'd be forgiving yourself.</v>

2854
02:04:06.750 --> 02:04:07.070
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

2855
02:04:07.070 --> 02:04:07.550
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you,</v>

2856
02:04:07.550 --> 02:04:11.530
<v Speaker 3>learned your goddamn lesson now until you come to your cell phone in your hands</v>

2857
02:04:11.540 --> 02:04:12.111
<v Speaker 3>nice and say,</v>

2858
02:04:12.111 --> 02:04:12.740
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2859
02:04:12.740 --> 02:04:16.400
<v Speaker 3>here's the periodic ways that was foolish.</v>

2860
02:04:16.670 --> 02:04:19.500
<v Speaker 3>Blind like an exhaustive accommodated,</v>

2861
02:04:19.640 --> 02:04:21.080
<v Speaker 3>and here's what I'm going to do.</v>

2862
02:04:21.140 --> 02:04:25.430
<v Speaker 3>Here's what I've already started to do to put it right or do you allow me</v>

2863
02:04:25.460 --> 02:04:26.660
<v Speaker 3>another chance?</v>

2864
02:04:27.110 --> 02:04:32.110
<v Speaker 3>That's and then that forgiveness is because this justice to right.</v>

2865
02:04:33.180 --> 02:04:34.250
<v Speaker 3>There's not just mercy.</v>

2866
02:04:34.251 --> 02:04:35.570
<v Speaker 3>There's also justice.</v>

2867
02:04:35.720 --> 02:04:37.040
<v Speaker 3>You can throw a whole justice,</v>

2868
02:04:37.120 --> 02:04:38.220
<v Speaker 3>no proceeded mercy.</v>

2869
02:04:38.430 --> 02:04:43.430
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't work that way and so you want to forgive if you can because why?</v>

2870
02:04:43.891 --> 02:04:46.020
<v Speaker 3>Carrying with you if you don't have to,</v>

2871
02:04:47.160 --> 02:04:52.160
<v Speaker 3>but forgiveness requires repentance clearly.</v>

2872
02:04:53.430 --> 02:04:55.750
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise it's just application of responsibility.</v>

2873
02:04:56.310 --> 02:05:01.040
<v Speaker 3>You don't forgive your job for doing something stupid so easily because all you</v>

2874
02:05:01.041 --> 02:05:02.700
<v Speaker 3>do is encourage them to do stupid things.</v>

2875
02:05:02.701 --> 02:05:02.951
<v Speaker 3>He say,</v>

2876
02:05:02.951 --> 02:05:03.271
<v Speaker 3>well look,</v>

2877
02:05:03.271 --> 02:05:04.740
<v Speaker 3>you did something stupid like,</v>

2878
02:05:04.741 --> 02:05:04.891
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2879
02:05:04.891 --> 02:05:05.551
<v Speaker 3>can you forgive me?</v>

2880
02:05:05.551 --> 02:05:05.851
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2881
02:05:05.851 --> 02:05:06.684
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2882
02:05:07.140 --> 02:05:08.640
<v Speaker 3>what can you do those stupid.</v>

2883
02:05:09.450 --> 02:05:10.283
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2884
02:05:10.560 --> 02:05:11.700
<v Speaker 3>Why didn't you do it?</v>

2885
02:05:12.810 --> 02:05:16.920
<v Speaker 3>How is it likely that you're not going to do it again in the future?</v>

2886
02:05:17.190 --> 02:05:18.900
<v Speaker 3>Can you convince me of that?</v>

2887
02:05:18.960 --> 02:05:22.320
<v Speaker 3>And he don't want to let your kid off easily with that because you don't want</v>

2888
02:05:22.321 --> 02:05:24.120
<v Speaker 3>them to them the same stupid thing to feature.</v>

2889
02:05:24.150 --> 02:05:25.460
<v Speaker 3>So if they don't understand it,</v>

2890
02:05:25.470 --> 02:05:28.560
<v Speaker 3>they don't have an alternative plan and they haven't repented,</v>

2891
02:05:28.660 --> 02:05:32.490
<v Speaker 3>then what the hell is what good is it to forgive them so I get it?</v>

2892
02:05:32.491 --> 02:05:32.731
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2893
02:05:32.731 --> 02:05:33.250
<v Speaker 3>no problem.</v>

2894
02:05:33.250 --> 02:05:35.760
<v Speaker 3>Can go do it again so that to you,</v>

2895
02:05:35.790 --> 02:05:36.750
<v Speaker 3>that's not love,</v>

2896
02:05:37.890 --> 02:05:42.000
<v Speaker 3>that's not locked office turned to help the person not doing the same stupid</v>

2897
02:05:42.001 --> 02:05:42.810
<v Speaker 3>thing again.</v>

2898
02:05:42.810 --> 02:05:45.480
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you have to hold someone's foot to the cold,</v>

2899
02:05:45.481 --> 02:05:46.350
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>

2900
02:05:46.680 --> 02:05:46.951
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2901
02:05:46.951 --> 02:05:47.281
<v Speaker 3>and say,</v>

2902
02:05:47.281 --> 02:05:47.551
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2903
02:05:47.551 --> 02:05:50.520
<v Speaker 3>I see what you're doing and you're not going to get away with it because it's</v>

2904
02:05:50.521 --> 02:05:51.540
<v Speaker 3>not good for you.</v>

2905
02:05:52.640 --> 02:05:53.520
<v Speaker 3>That's</v>

2906
02:05:56.220 --> 02:05:58.440
<v Speaker 3>forgiveness is not the only moral virtue.</v>

2907
02:05:59.900 --> 02:06:01.170
<v Speaker 3>Stretch to the imagination.</v>

2908
02:06:01.171 --> 02:06:03.870
<v Speaker 3>Just like compassion is not the only moral virtue.</v>

2909
02:06:04.610 --> 02:06:06.180
<v Speaker 3>So all.</v>

2910
02:06:06.250 --> 02:06:06.810
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2911
02:06:06.810 --> 02:06:08.460
<v Speaker 3>we've got time for one more.</v>

2912
02:06:08.970 --> 02:06:10.560
<v Speaker 3>This is probably the appropriate,</v>

2913
02:06:10.561 --> 02:06:11.910
<v Speaker 3>what you mentioned,</v>

2914
02:06:11.911 --> 02:06:16.911
<v Speaker 3>consistency consistently had a goal in life and when you say that yours has</v>

2915
02:06:17.281 --> 02:06:19.440
<v Speaker 3>changed after you released your book,</v>

2916
02:06:19.520 --> 02:06:21.900
<v Speaker 3>so right now as we begin this tour,</v>

2917
02:06:22.310 --> 02:06:24.810
<v Speaker 3>is your job,</v>

2918
02:06:25.260 --> 02:06:26.093
<v Speaker 3>your goal.</v>

2919
02:06:26.310 --> 02:06:27.400
<v Speaker 3>I want to do a good job,</v>

2920
02:06:27.410 --> 02:06:28.260
<v Speaker 3>a snore.</v>

2921
02:06:28.850 --> 02:06:31.520
<v Speaker 3>That's my whole flipping out about six months later.</v>

2922
02:06:32.130 --> 02:06:36.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I can look any farther than that because the landscape is changing</v>

2923
02:06:36.691 --> 02:06:39.720
<v Speaker 3>very rapidly and I don't know what to make of it all.</v>

2924
02:06:40.110 --> 02:06:41.060
<v Speaker 3>Not even a bit,</v>

2925
02:06:41.820 --> 02:06:44.750
<v Speaker 3>but I know why you would have some touchstones.</v>

2926
02:06:45.060 --> 02:06:46.620
<v Speaker 3>This seems worthwhile.</v>

2927
02:06:47.080 --> 02:06:47.400
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2928
02:06:47.400 --> 02:06:48.420
<v Speaker 3>I enjoyed doing it.</v>

2929
02:06:48.421 --> 02:06:49.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm extraordinarily pleased.</v>

2930
02:06:52.220 --> 02:06:57.220
<v Speaker 3>Thanks.</v>

2931
02:07:00.190 --> 02:07:05.190
<v Speaker 3>We'll talk to 100,000 people live in the next two months,</v>

2932
02:07:05.941 --> 02:07:07.050
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>

2933
02:07:07.200 --> 02:07:11.820
<v Speaker 3>and so I'll try to concentrate on making this is part of shrinking the</v>

2934
02:07:11.821 --> 02:07:12.420
<v Speaker 3>timeframe.</v>

2935
02:07:12.420 --> 02:07:13.250
<v Speaker 3>Do you know?</v>

2936
02:07:13.250 --> 02:07:14.100
<v Speaker 3>It's very busy.</v>

2937
02:07:14.101 --> 02:07:19.101
<v Speaker 3>I try to concentrate on the property as the big has sufficient people.</v>

2938
02:07:19.291 --> 02:07:19.880
<v Speaker 3>They're off,</v>

2939
02:07:19.880 --> 02:07:20.713
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

2940
02:07:21.090 --> 02:07:26.090
<v Speaker 3>and then I can come and talk to audiences like audiences have individuals like</v>

2941
02:07:26.371 --> 02:07:29.310
<v Speaker 3>you and we can make a little progress to say to kids,</v>

2942
02:07:29.311 --> 02:07:30.144
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2943
02:07:30.510 --> 02:07:32.130
<v Speaker 3>That's great.</v>

2944
02:07:32.220 --> 02:07:33.240
<v Speaker 3>As far as I'm concerned,</v>

2945
02:07:33.241 --> 02:07:38.241
<v Speaker 3>like I can't think of anything that could more worth doing than that and so and</v>

2946
02:07:39.461 --> 02:07:43.180
<v Speaker 3>hopefully I can do that credibly over the next six months that I've been</v>

2947
02:07:43.181 --> 02:07:48.181
<v Speaker 3>building a kind of structural infrastructure underneath vs because this is God,</v>

2948
02:07:48.900 --> 02:07:53.900
<v Speaker 3>this is whatever this is has taken on kind of a life of its own and I've had to</v>

2949
02:07:55.031 --> 02:07:58.540
<v Speaker 3>build a management structure underneath it to make sure that it works properly.</v>

2950
02:07:58.950 --> 02:08:00.040
<v Speaker 3>As a creative artist,</v>

2951
02:08:00.100 --> 02:08:00.933
<v Speaker 3>agents,</v>

2952
02:08:00.980 --> 02:08:01.331
<v Speaker 3>artist,</v>

2953
02:08:01.331 --> 02:08:02.560
<v Speaker 3>agency in La,</v>

2954
02:08:02.650 --> 02:08:04.450
<v Speaker 3>it's been helping me set up this tour.</v>

2955
02:08:04.451 --> 02:08:05.980
<v Speaker 3>They've been unbelievably helpful.</v>

2956
02:08:05.981 --> 02:08:06.900
<v Speaker 3>They're so competent,</v>

2957
02:08:06.920 --> 02:08:09.640
<v Speaker 3>but just a pleasure to work with is thinking.</v>

2958
02:08:09.700 --> 02:08:11.190
<v Speaker 3>It's just going so smoothly,</v>

2959
02:08:11.340 --> 02:08:11.591
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2960
02:08:11.591 --> 02:08:13.930
<v Speaker 3>Dave's been given me a hand and I think that's great.</v>

2961
02:08:13.931 --> 02:08:14.780
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2962
02:08:15.280 --> 02:08:20.280
<v Speaker 3>so I'm concentrating on making sure that these folks are alive and real and then</v>

2963
02:08:21.971 --> 02:08:25.510
<v Speaker 3>building the technical infrastructure around all this to make sure that it goes</v>

2964
02:08:25.570 --> 02:08:30.400
<v Speaker 3>smoothly as possible and hoping that I can concentrate on getting that property</v>

2965
02:08:30.700 --> 02:08:35.200
<v Speaker 3>at the highest level that I'm incapable over the next six months and we'll see</v>

2966
02:08:35.201 --> 02:08:35.950
<v Speaker 3>what happens.</v>

2967
02:08:35.950 --> 02:08:37.420
<v Speaker 3>This is another thing that's cool.</v>

2968
02:08:37.450 --> 02:08:39.160
<v Speaker 3>This is something to really think about.</v>

2969
02:08:39.370 --> 02:08:41.370
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the best things that I've ever learned.</v>

2970
02:08:42.340 --> 02:08:45.070
<v Speaker 3>There's some real is something about telling the truth,</v>

2971
02:08:45.700 --> 02:08:48.160
<v Speaker 3>which is rule eight,</v>

2972
02:08:48.220 --> 02:08:49.420
<v Speaker 3>if I remember correctly,</v>

2973
02:08:50.850 --> 02:08:53.470
<v Speaker 3>the rule is to tell the truth or at least to apply,</v>

2974
02:08:54.880 --> 02:08:55.713
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2975
02:08:56.290 --> 02:08:59.770
<v Speaker 3>if you say what you think and you have to do this carefully and you have to know</v>

2976
02:08:59.771 --> 02:09:01.320
<v Speaker 3>what you think and you have to watch it.</v>

2977
02:09:01.390 --> 02:09:02.620
<v Speaker 3>So it's not an easy thing,</v>

2978
02:09:02.950 --> 02:09:05.830
<v Speaker 3>but it's so incredibly adventurous.</v>

2979
02:09:06.150 --> 02:09:07.240
<v Speaker 3>It never bored.</v>

2980
02:09:07.770 --> 02:09:07.960
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2981
02:09:07.960 --> 02:09:08.950
<v Speaker 3>Because if you say,</v>

2982
02:09:08.951 --> 02:09:09.461
<v Speaker 3>what do you think?</v>

2983
02:09:09.461 --> 02:09:10.640
<v Speaker 3>You don't know what's going to happen.</v>

2984
02:09:11.830 --> 02:09:13.270
<v Speaker 3>God knows what happened,</v>

2985
02:09:13.271 --> 02:09:16.630
<v Speaker 3>like all sorts of weird things will happen that you might not cope with them,</v>

2986
02:09:16.631 --> 02:09:17.330
<v Speaker 3>but I'll tell you,</v>

2987
02:09:17.330 --> 02:09:18.200
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to find.</v>

2988
02:09:18.220 --> 02:09:21.190
<v Speaker 3>You can see this white.</v>

2989
02:09:21.340 --> 02:09:25.210
<v Speaker 3>The idea though of telling the truth is associated with the idea of faith</v>

2990
02:09:25.420 --> 02:09:29.320
<v Speaker 3>because there's a proposition and it's laid out in the first chapter of genesis</v>

2991
02:09:29.321 --> 02:09:32.200
<v Speaker 3>and the proposition basically if something like this,</v>

2992
02:09:32.201 --> 02:09:37.090
<v Speaker 3>if you wanted to express it sort of psychological language that the being that</v>

2993
02:09:37.091 --> 02:09:42.091
<v Speaker 3>you bring into mediating by telling them the truth is the being that is good,</v>

2994
02:09:42.850 --> 02:09:44.230
<v Speaker 3>so that's a proposition.</v>

2995
02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:46.000
<v Speaker 3>It's like an axiom of faith.</v>

2996
02:09:46.030 --> 02:09:46.321
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

2997
02:09:46.321 --> 02:09:47.154
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2998
02:09:47.320 --> 02:09:51.460
<v Speaker 3>that the universe is constituted so that whatever you bring into being by</v>

2999
02:09:51.461 --> 02:09:53.830
<v Speaker 3>telling the truth is is good,</v>

3000
02:09:54.700 --> 02:09:58.000
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't necessarily manifest itself that way in the moment.</v>

3001
02:09:58.450 --> 02:09:58.780
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3002
02:09:58.780 --> 02:10:00.460
<v Speaker 3>because good is really complicated,</v>

3003
02:10:00.520 --> 02:10:01.000
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3004
02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.970
<v Speaker 3>Something can be terrible at the moment and then turn out to be pretty damn</v>

3005
02:10:03.971 --> 02:10:04.480
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

3006
02:10:04.480 --> 02:10:09.010
<v Speaker 3>That's happening with a lot of these protests which were unbelievably painful in</v>

3007
02:10:09.011 --> 02:10:09.401
<v Speaker 3>the moment,</v>

3008
02:10:09.401 --> 02:10:10.420
<v Speaker 3>like the one I'm queens,</v>

3009
02:10:10.421 --> 02:10:15.370
<v Speaker 3>which was just an absolute Zombie nightmare.</v>

3010
02:10:16.840 --> 02:10:17.501
<v Speaker 3>Talk about,</v>

3011
02:10:17.501 --> 02:10:18.880
<v Speaker 3>we'll get an audience,</v>

3012
02:10:18.881 --> 02:10:22.110
<v Speaker 3>we're afraid it this really uncanny but,</v>

3013
02:10:22.820 --> 02:10:27.820
<v Speaker 3>but it unfolded well as progressed and so I decided a long time ago,</v>

3014
02:10:29.830 --> 02:10:34.830
<v Speaker 3>probably 30 years ago that I was going to be fairly careful with what I said I</v>

3015
02:10:35.100 --> 02:10:38.330
<v Speaker 3>was going to watch every word I said and every word that I wrote and see if the</v>

3016
02:10:38.331 --> 02:10:42.980
<v Speaker 3>words maverick as if they really mattered and now I'm supposed to say what I</v>

3017
02:10:43.010 --> 02:10:48.010
<v Speaker 3>thought carefully and let whatever happened happen no matter what it was.</v>

3018
02:10:48.980 --> 02:10:49.813
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

3019
02:10:52.460 --> 02:10:55.150
<v Speaker 3>if you're looking for an adventure man,</v>

3020
02:10:55.910 --> 02:10:56.760
<v Speaker 3>you do that,</v>

3021
02:10:56.790 --> 02:10:57.920
<v Speaker 3>you'll have your adventure.</v>

3022
02:10:58.130 --> 02:10:58.963
<v Speaker 3>That's for sure.</v>

3023
02:10:59.540 --> 02:11:00.373
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

3024
02:11:04.330 --> 02:11:07.150
<v Speaker 3>well that's what I'm trying to see the limits of that I guess.</v>

3025
02:11:07.160 --> 02:11:07.570
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3026
02:11:07.570 --> 02:11:12.570
<v Speaker 3>it's like I wrote that whole being and that'd be lectured them on time and</v>

3027
02:11:13.280 --> 02:11:14.051
<v Speaker 3>successfully,</v>

3028
02:11:14.051 --> 02:11:14.331
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3029
02:11:14.331 --> 02:11:16.280
<v Speaker 3>the students have really responded to it.</v>

3030
02:11:16.281 --> 02:11:19.450
<v Speaker 3>Then for whatever reason,</v>

3031
02:11:20.060 --> 02:11:25.060
<v Speaker 3>now it's very crazily distributed.</v>

3032
02:11:26.390 --> 02:11:28.940
<v Speaker 3>You know right now on youtube,</v>

3033
02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:34.840
<v Speaker 3>people are making 4,000 videos go week about my videos.</v>

3034
02:11:36.800 --> 02:11:38.020
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

3035
02:11:38.190 --> 02:11:40.310
<v Speaker 3>it's absolutely.</v>

3036
02:11:40.490 --> 02:11:43.300
<v Speaker 3>I'd have to say what to make of it,</v>

3037
02:11:43.310 --> 02:11:44.143
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

3038
02:11:46.430 --> 02:11:47.990
<v Speaker 3>we'll see how it plays out.</v>

3039
02:11:49.050 --> 02:11:54.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna try to do it as well as I can and watch what happens because I'll tell</v>

3040
02:11:54.290 --> 02:11:55.123
<v Speaker 3>you it's,</v>

3041
02:11:55.130 --> 02:11:56.510
<v Speaker 3>it's not dog.</v>

3042
02:11:59.080 --> 02:12:04.080
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

3043
02:12:12.970 --> 02:12:16.380
<v Speaker 3>I just want to thank you for letting me be part of this role,</v>

3044
02:12:16.570 --> 02:12:17.403
<v Speaker 3>but more importantly,</v>

3045
02:12:17.620 --> 02:12:18.250
<v Speaker 3>it's an honor.</v>

3046
02:12:18.250 --> 02:12:20.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean the things they eat better.</v>

3047
02:12:21.060 --> 02:12:22.510
<v Speaker 3>It's still a work in progress,</v>

3048
02:12:22.860 --> 02:12:26.170
<v Speaker 3>but I'm honored to be part of this and I can't wait to see what the next two</v>

3049
02:12:26.171 --> 02:12:28.360
<v Speaker 3>months brand for all of us.</v>

3050
02:12:28.361 --> 02:12:28.691
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3051
02:12:28.691 --> 02:12:29.480
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3052
02:12:29.480 --> 02:12:30.313
<v Speaker 3>give it up.</v>

3053
02:12:30.900 --> 02:12:35.900
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

3054
02:12:36.930 --> 02:12:37.231
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

3055
02:12:37.231 --> 02:12:38.100
<v Speaker 4>congratulations.</v>

3056
02:12:38.101 --> 02:12:38.970
<v Speaker 4>You made it to the end.</v>

3057
02:12:39.180 --> 02:12:40.013
<v Speaker 4>Thanks for listening.</v>

3058
02:12:40.270 --> 02:12:41.430
<v Speaker 4>Hope you enjoyed the talk.</v>

3059
02:12:41.580 --> 02:12:41.911
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

3060
02:12:41.911 --> 02:12:42.744
<v Speaker 4>I really did.</v>

3061
02:12:42.780 --> 02:12:45.720
<v Speaker 4>At some points I felt like Peterson was speaking directly to me.</v>

3062
02:12:45.810 --> 02:12:48.750
<v Speaker 4>Like when he says you've got yourself half put together,</v>

3063
02:12:48.810 --> 02:12:49.650
<v Speaker 4>you're 21,</v>

3064
02:12:50.050 --> 02:12:51.690
<v Speaker 4>it can be deadly by the time you're 30.</v>

3065
02:12:52.110 --> 02:12:55.230
<v Speaker 4>I'm 21 myself and I feel like that's incredibly encouraging for me.</v>

3066
02:12:55.560 --> 02:12:58.230
<v Speaker 4>I felt like I've been a mess for the last 20 years at least,</v>

3067
02:12:58.231 --> 02:13:01.320
<v Speaker 4>and it's only been this past year that I've been trying to improve myself for</v>

3068
02:13:01.321 --> 02:13:02.154
<v Speaker 4>the better.</v>

3069
02:13:02.240 --> 02:13:05.300
<v Speaker 4>Here's some of the other inspiring things that he said that I especially took</v>

3070
02:13:05.301 --> 02:13:06.134
<v Speaker 4>note of.</v>

3071
02:13:06.140 --> 02:13:07.850
<v Speaker 4>You want to be an example to yourself.</v>

3072
02:13:08.480 --> 02:13:10.490
<v Speaker 4>You can be competent in 10 different domains.</v>

3073
02:13:10.491 --> 02:13:12.110
<v Speaker 4>You can be a force of nature.</v>

3074
02:13:12.500 --> 02:13:15.530
<v Speaker 4>Make yourself so competent that you're just terrifying.</v>

3075
02:13:16.010 --> 02:13:19.370
<v Speaker 4>Another thing I particularly enjoyed was when he was talking about people such</v>

3076
02:13:19.371 --> 02:13:20.204
<v Speaker 4>as myself,</v>

3077
02:13:20.270 --> 02:13:22.880
<v Speaker 4>people who have been inspired by what he's been saying,</v>

3078
02:13:23.040 --> 02:13:23.540
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3079
02:13:23.540 --> 02:13:26.240
<v Speaker 4>he said that referring to people such as myself,</v>

3080
02:13:26.420 --> 02:13:27.680
<v Speaker 4>they want a pat on the back,</v>

3081
02:13:28.160 --> 02:13:29.210
<v Speaker 4>not for what they've done,</v>

3082
02:13:29.540 --> 02:13:31.440
<v Speaker 4>but because they're on the path to something greater.</v>

3083
02:13:31.740 --> 02:13:36.740
<v Speaker 4>And I felt like for most of my life I've been told to be myself and to accept</v>

3084
02:13:36.931 --> 02:13:41.931
<v Speaker 4>myself for who I am and I could never really take that advice because I didn't</v>

3085
02:13:42.121 --> 02:13:44.940
<v Speaker 4>really like myself and I didn't really know who I was,</v>

3086
02:13:44.941 --> 02:13:46.530
<v Speaker 4>who this person was.</v>

3087
02:13:46.531 --> 02:13:49.080
<v Speaker 4>So I felt like that advice was just lost on me.</v>

3088
02:13:49.260 --> 02:13:52.260
<v Speaker 4>But I think it's great to hear that you can transform.</v>

3089
02:13:52.261 --> 02:13:53.610
<v Speaker 4>If you don't like what you are,</v>

3090
02:13:53.611 --> 02:13:55.290
<v Speaker 4>you can become better.</v>

3091
02:13:55.291 --> 02:13:58.050
<v Speaker 4>You can transform into a warrior.</v>

3092
02:13:58.260 --> 02:13:59.880
<v Speaker 4>That's another thing I really liked that he said,</v>

3093
02:13:59.881 --> 02:14:02.460
<v Speaker 4>transform yourself into a warrior.</v>

3094
02:14:03.040 --> 02:14:04.410
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly what I want to do,</v>

3095
02:14:04.411 --> 02:14:05.244
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

3096
02:14:05.280 --> 02:14:06.113
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>

3097
02:14:06.120 --> 02:14:08.550
<v Speaker 4>I know you clicked on this video to hear Dr Pearson speak,</v>

3098
02:14:08.551 --> 02:14:09.930
<v Speaker 4>but if you like what I've been saying,</v>

3099
02:14:10.170 --> 02:14:14.460
<v Speaker 4>please consider subscribing for more Jordan Peterson psychology and philosophy</v>

3101
02:14:15.360 --> 02:14:16.193
<v Speaker 4>Thanks for listening.</v>

02:14:16.320 --> 02:14:17.100
<v Speaker 4>Have a beautiful day.</v>
