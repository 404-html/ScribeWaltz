1
00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:06.881
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2
00:00:06.881 --> 00:00:09.280
<v Speaker 1>what I'm worried about also in this age of social media,</v>

3
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:10.541
<v Speaker 1>I've noticed as a,</v>

4
00:00:10.541 --> 00:00:12.220
<v Speaker 1>as a teacher in the classroom,</v>

5
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.870
<v Speaker 1>that the young people are so used to communicating now by cell phone,</v>

6
00:00:16.871 --> 00:00:17.081
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

7
00:00:17.081 --> 00:00:17.914
<v Speaker 1>Buy iPhone,</v>

8
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.840
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

9
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.290
<v Speaker 1>that they're losing body language and facial expressions.</v>

10
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.590
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

11
00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.340
<v Speaker 1>Which I think is going to compound the problem with these dating encounters.</v>

12
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.601
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

13
00:00:28.601 --> 00:00:32.770
<v Speaker 1>Because the ability to read the human face and into,</v>

14
00:00:32.771 --> 00:00:33.071
<v Speaker 1>into,</v>

15
00:00:33.071 --> 00:00:35.860
<v Speaker 1>into read little tiny inflections of emotion.</v>

16
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.000
<v Speaker 1>I think my generation got that from looking at great foreign films with,</v>

17
00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:40.301
<v Speaker 1>with our,</v>

18
00:00:40.301 --> 00:00:41.530
<v Speaker 1>with our long takes,</v>

19
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.900
<v Speaker 1>cause you'd have drawn Moreau and FM to nerves.</v>

20
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:44.440
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

21
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.360
<v Speaker 1>And like a potential romantic encounters.</v>

22
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.510
<v Speaker 1>And you could usually see the tiniest little little inflections that signal</v>

23
00:00:51.851 --> 00:00:53.910
<v Speaker 1>communication or sexual readiness or,</v>

24
00:00:53.911 --> 00:00:56.590
<v Speaker 1>or irony or skepticism or distance or whatever.</v>

25
00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:02.060
<v Speaker 1>But the inability to read the other people's intentions that I think this is</v>

26
00:01:02.141 --> 00:01:02.951
<v Speaker 1>going to be a disaster.</v>

27
00:01:02.951 --> 00:01:04.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean I just noticed that,</v>

28
00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:05.440
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

29
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.850
<v Speaker 1>how year by year.</v>

30
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.260
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

31
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.330
<v Speaker 1>The students are becoming much more flat affect.</v>

32
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.020
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

33
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.750
<v Speaker 1>And they themselves complained that they'll sit in the same room with someone</v>

34
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.760
<v Speaker 1>and be texting to each other.</v>

35
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:16.150
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

36
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

37
00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:17.051
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

38
00:01:17.051 --> 00:01:17.650
<v Speaker 2>Well there's a,</v>

39
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.440
<v Speaker 2>there's a piece of evidence to that supports that to some degree.</v>

40
00:01:20.441 --> 00:01:23.860
<v Speaker 2>So women with brothers are less likely to get raped.</v>

41
00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.140
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is that they've learned that nonverbal language deeply.</v>

42
00:01:29.141 --> 00:01:29.411
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

43
00:01:29.411 --> 00:01:29.860
<v Speaker 2>And they can,</v>

44
00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:30.280
<v Speaker 2>they can,</v>

45
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.510
<v Speaker 2>they can spot the,</v>

46
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.850
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

47
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:33.800
<v Speaker 1>I have noticed,</v>

48
00:01:33.801 --> 00:01:34.520
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

49
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.701
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

50
00:01:34.701 --> 00:01:35.210
<v Speaker 1>in my,</v>

51
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.110
<v Speaker 1>in my career,</v>

52
00:01:36.111 --> 00:01:36.291
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

53
00:01:36.291 --> 00:01:36.631
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

54
00:01:36.631 --> 00:01:39.660
<v Speaker 1>that women who have many brothers okay.</v>

55
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.840
<v Speaker 1>Are very good.</v>

56
00:01:41.841 --> 00:01:42.291
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

57
00:01:42.291 --> 00:01:45.080
<v Speaker 1>As administrators and as business people.</v>

58
00:01:45.081 --> 00:01:45.440
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

59
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.860
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

60
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.530
<v Speaker 1>Because they don't take men seriously.</v>

61
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.100
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

62
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.930
<v Speaker 1>They regard,</v>

63
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:50.420
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

64
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.680
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

65
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.590
<v Speaker 1>they saw their brothers,</v>

66
00:01:51.591 --> 00:01:52.760
<v Speaker 1>they think they're brothers aren't jokes.</v>

67
00:01:52.761 --> 00:01:53.180
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

68
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.590
<v Speaker 1>But they know how to control men.</v>

69
00:01:54.591 --> 00:01:55.070
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

70
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.580
<v Speaker 1>While it,</v>

71
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.020
<v Speaker 1>while they still like men.</v>

72
00:01:57.021 --> 00:01:57.360
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

73
00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.340
<v Speaker 1>They admire men.</v>

74
00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.830
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

75
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.590
<v Speaker 1>So this is something I have seen repeatedly.</v>

76
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.080
<v Speaker 2>There will be also reflective of the problem of fewer and fewer siblings.</v>

77
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.810
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

78
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:07.570
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

79
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

80
00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

81
00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:10.380
<v Speaker 1>And I've noticed this in publishing.</v>

82
00:02:10.381 --> 00:02:10.580
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

83
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.980
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

84
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:11.590
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>

85
00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.200
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

86
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.410
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

87
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:13.580
<v Speaker 1>the women who have job,</v>

88
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.880
<v Speaker 1>the job of publicist,</v>

89
00:02:14.881 --> 00:02:15.181
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

90
00:02:15.181 --> 00:02:17.490
<v Speaker 1>And writes the Topis as manager of publicity.</v>

91
00:02:17.491 --> 00:02:18.000
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

92
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.420
<v Speaker 1>Their ability to take charge of men and,</v>

93
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.760
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

94
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.960
<v Speaker 1>and their humor at men,</v>

95
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.390
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

96
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.630
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

97
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:23.030
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

98
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.650
<v Speaker 1>and in,</v>

99
00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.450
<v Speaker 1>and they have great relationships with men because they don't have the sense of</v>

100
00:02:27.451 --> 00:02:28.440
<v Speaker 1>resentment in an,</v>

101
00:02:28.441 --> 00:02:28.600
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

102
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.711
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

103
00:02:28.711 --> 00:02:30.240
<v Speaker 1>in worry and anxiety.</v>

104
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.190
<v Speaker 1>And so they don't see men as aggressors.</v>

105
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.053
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

106
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.230
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's another thing too,</v>

107
00:02:34.231 --> 00:02:36.300
<v Speaker 1>is that as feminism,</v>

108
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

109
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.321
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

110
00:02:37.321 --> 00:02:37.441
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

111
00:02:37.441 --> 00:02:38.860
<v Speaker 1>moved into his presence,</v>

112
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.440
<v Speaker 1>it's a system of videology.</v>

113
00:02:40.441 --> 00:02:40.980
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

114
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.450
<v Speaker 1>It has tended to,</v>

115
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

116
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.770
<v Speaker 1>denigrate motherhood.</v>

117
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.470
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

118
00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.300
<v Speaker 1>As a lesser order of human experience and to enshrine,</v>

119
00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:48.601
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

120
00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:49.090
<v Speaker 1>abortion.</v>

121
00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.150
<v Speaker 1>I am 100% of abortion rights.</v>

122
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.421
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

123
00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:54.650
<v Speaker 1>I belong to planned parenthood for years until I finally rejected it as on</v>

124
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.010
<v Speaker 1>branch or the Democratic Party,</v>

125
00:02:56.011 --> 00:02:57.210
<v Speaker 1>my own party and so on.</v>

126
00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

127
00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.070
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

128
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.620
<v Speaker 1>but as became excluded as s feminists and became obsessed okay.</v>

129
00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:03.370
<v Speaker 1>With the,</v>

130
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.641
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

131
00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:05.290
<v Speaker 1>with the work with a professional woman.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

133
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.060
<v Speaker 1>I feel that the lessons are that mothers learn had been lost.</v>

134
00:03:10.061 --> 00:03:10.480
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

135

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

142
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.040
<v Speaker 1>Which is okay if the,</v>

143
00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.883
<v Speaker 1>the mothers who,</v>

144
00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.410
<v Speaker 1>who bear boy children.</v>

145

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Understand the fragility of men,</v>

147
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.820
<v Speaker 1>the fragility and boys,</v>

148
00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:22.750
<v Speaker 1>they understand it.</v>

149
00:03:22.751 --> 00:03:23.051
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>

150
00:03:23.051 --> 00:03:23.884
<v Speaker 1>they don't seem them.</v>

151
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:24.560
<v Speaker 1>Men,</v>

152
00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.860
<v Speaker 1>boys and men as a menace.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

155
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.380
<v Speaker 1>So there's this tenderness and connectedness between the,</v>

156
00:03:32.381 --> 00:03:35.230
<v Speaker 1>between the mother and the boy child.</v>

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.730
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

163
00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.140
<v Speaker 1>The LG has risen up on campuses where we're all,</v>

164
00:03:47.141 --> 00:03:47.650
<v Speaker 1>none of the,</v>

165
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:48.460
<v Speaker 1>none of the girls know.</v>

166
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:49.540
<v Speaker 1>The students have married,</v>

167
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:50.830

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

180
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.850
<v Speaker 1>The fringes,</v>

181
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.040
<v Speaker 1>they don't understand this hypersensitivity of boys.</v>

182
00:04:09.041 --> 00:04:09.870
<v Speaker 1>It's not understood.</v>

183

193
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:19.570
<v Speaker 1>is interpreted as aggression.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

195
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:21.760
<v Speaker 1>Potential violence and so on.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

202
00:04:26.981 --> 00:04:27.910
<v Speaker 1>If we would have,</v>

203
00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:28.900
<v Speaker 1>I have proposed,</v>

204
00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:29.470
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

205
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.700
<v Speaker 1>That colleges should allow when the moment a woman has entered has entered.</v>

206
00:04:33.701 --> 00:04:34.240
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.370
<v Speaker 1>She has entrusted in that college for life.</v>

208
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.940
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

209
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:37.870
<v Speaker 1>And that she,</v>

210
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.110
<v Speaker 1>that she should be free to leave.</v>

211
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.471
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

212
00:04:41.471 --> 00:04:42.760
<v Speaker 1>To have babies when she,</v>

213
00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:44.080
<v Speaker 1>when her body wants them babies,</v>

214
00:04:44.081 --> 00:04:45.100
<v Speaker 1>when it's healthy to have no.</v>

215
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.850
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

216
00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.230
<v Speaker 1>And then return have,</v>

217
00:04:47.231 --> 00:04:50.560
<v Speaker 1>haven't had the occasional course so it can build up credits and father's going</v>

218
00:04:50.561 --> 00:04:50.711
<v Speaker 1>to be,</v>

219
00:04:50.711 --> 00:04:54.430
<v Speaker 1>you might be able to do it as it as well and so on to get married women,</v>

220
00:04:54.431 --> 00:04:56.320
<v Speaker 1>women with children into the classroom.</v>

221
00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.100
<v Speaker 1>The moment that happens and it's happened after World War Two.</v>

222
00:05:00.101 --> 00:05:00.311
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

223
00:05:00.311 --> 00:05:00.651
<v Speaker 1>We've had,</v>

224
00:05:00.651 --> 00:05:03.910
<v Speaker 1>he had a lot of married you guys in the classroom and so on.</v>

225
00:05:03.911 --> 00:05:04.241
<v Speaker 1>Not yet.</v>

226
00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:05.260
<v Speaker 1>And it's not that many women,</v>

227
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.290
<v Speaker 1>the experience of a married person with a family.</v>

228
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.830
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

229
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.150
<v Speaker 1>Talking about gender,</v>

230
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.150
<v Speaker 1>but most of the gender stuff would be laughed out of the room.</v>

231
00:05:13.151 --> 00:05:13.331
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

232
00:05:13.331 --> 00:05:16.930
<v Speaker 1>If you had a real mother in there who had experienced in child birth and had it</v>

233
00:05:16.931 --> 00:05:19.230
<v Speaker 1>had rained and it was raising boys and so on.</v>

234
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:20.850
<v Speaker 1>So I think that that's also,</v>

235
00:05:20.851 --> 00:05:21.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

236

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

237
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.500
<v Speaker 1>something that has led to this,</v>

238
00:05:23.501 --> 00:05:23.741
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

239
00:05:23.741 --> 00:05:25.110
<v Speaker 1>this incredible art,</v>

240
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

241
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.010
<v Speaker 1>artificiality and,</v>

242
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

243
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:28.210
<v Speaker 1>and hysteria.</v>

244
00:05:28.211 --> 00:05:28.780
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

245
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:29.530
<v Speaker 1>Feminist rhetoric.</v>
