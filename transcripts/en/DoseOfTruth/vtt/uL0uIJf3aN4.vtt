00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.080
<v Speaker 1>So we should think about the hypothalamus forget,</v>

2
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.090
<v Speaker 1>because it seems to be pretty damn important.</v>

3
00:00:15.091 --> 00:00:15.924
<v Speaker 1>Consult,</v>

4
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.890
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

5
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.490
<v Speaker 1>people have wondered sometimes when they've asked me,</v>

7
00:00:20.491 --> 00:00:20.701
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8
00:00:20.701 --> 00:00:24.420
<v Speaker 1>where's the Super Ego and the ego and the Ed located in the brain.</v>

9
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.470
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

10
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.520
<v Speaker 1>it's a stupid question and it's not a stupid question.</v>

11
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:30.510
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

12
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:31.663
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

13
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.520
<v Speaker 1>it's actually a useful question at one level of analysis because you could say,</v>

14
00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:36.120
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

15
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.070
<v Speaker 1>the end from the [inaudible] perspective is sort of the,</v>

16
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.840
<v Speaker 1>the natural force that propels motivation.</v>

17
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:43.620
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

18
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.190
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

19
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.000
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

20
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.320
<v Speaker 1>when we say motivation,</v>

21
00:00:46.321 --> 00:00:49.650
<v Speaker 1>we're not saying much different than saying in,</v>

22
00:00:49.651 --> 00:00:50.250
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

23
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.461
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:00:50.461 --> 00:00:53.250
<v Speaker 1>it's the same kind of low resolution work.</v>

25
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.910
<v Speaker 1>And it's clearly the case that we have fundamental motivational systems and that</v>

26
00:00:56.911 --> 00:01:00.600
<v Speaker 1>we do share them with animals and that they do drive our behavior.</v>

27
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.160
<v Speaker 1>But they also drive our perceptions in all the ways that Freud thought about,</v>

28
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.581
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:05.581 --> 00:01:09.800
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things I really like about the psychoanalysts is that they,</v>

30
00:01:09.801 --> 00:01:10.500
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

31
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.000
<v Speaker 1>they never make the mistake of assuming that a motivational system or an</v>

32
00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:20.001
<v Speaker 1>emotional system is a mechanical system that reacts to deterministically.</v>

33
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.841
<v Speaker 1>They say no,</v>

34
00:01:21.841 --> 00:01:23.700
<v Speaker 1>those things are like personalities.</v>

35
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:24.330
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

36
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.920
<v Speaker 1>that's much more sophisticated viewpoint than the typical behaviorist or the</v>

37
00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:31.080
<v Speaker 1>typical cognitive psychologist,</v>

38
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

39
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.330
<v Speaker 1>because they tend to think of the computer in either stimulus response terms.</v>

40
00:01:36.331 --> 00:01:40.380
<v Speaker 1>So it's basically deterministic chains or as if the,</v>

41
00:01:40.381 --> 00:01:40.760
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

42
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.390
<v Speaker 1>the information processing system is a computational apparatus,</v>

43
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.500
<v Speaker 1>which it is.</v>

44
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.090
<v Speaker 1>But it's not only that,</v>

45
00:01:48.091 --> 00:01:48.331
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

46
00:01:48.331 --> 00:01:53.070
<v Speaker 1>it's an embodied computational apparatus and the body is a very sophisticated</v>

47
00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:53.790
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

48
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:54.001
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

49
00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:54.211
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

50
00:01:54.211 --> 00:01:56.880
<v Speaker 1>it's been very difficult for us to build embodied robots.</v>

51
00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.270
<v Speaker 1>And it's also the case that until you build in body robots,</v>

52
00:02:00.271 --> 00:02:01.980
<v Speaker 1>the things don't really get smart,</v>

53
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.910
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

54
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:03.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

55
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.540
<v Speaker 1>You have to have a body for the thing to actually have any intelligence.</v>

56
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.020
<v Speaker 1>And that was actually figured out by a robotics engineer named Rodney Brooks</v>

57
00:02:10.021 --> 00:02:14.490
<v Speaker 1>back in the 1990s 92 93 published a couple of papers on that saying,</v>

58
00:02:14.491 --> 00:02:14.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

59
00:02:14.731 --> 00:02:16.920
<v Speaker 1>that if we were going to build artificial intelligence,</v>

60
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.350
<v Speaker 1>we shouldn't start from the top down.</v>

61
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.590
<v Speaker 1>We shouldn't build a world modeling machine.</v>

62
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.320
<v Speaker 1>And then embedded in something that moves around,</v>

63
00:02:25.321 --> 00:02:28.440
<v Speaker 1>we should build something that sort of moves around semi autonomously,</v>

64
00:02:28.441 --> 00:02:29.790
<v Speaker 1>like a stupid insect.</v>

65
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.530
<v Speaker 1>Insects aren't stupid.</v>

66
00:02:31.531 --> 00:02:35.250
<v Speaker 1>So I do mean as stupid insect and if we could manage that,</v>

67
00:02:35.251 --> 00:02:36.720
<v Speaker 1>we'd really be doing something,</v>

68
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.381
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

69
00:02:37.381 --> 00:02:38.214
<v Speaker 1>and I think we've,</v>

70
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.100
<v Speaker 1>we might've gotten beyond the stupid insect level of,</v>

71
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.540
<v Speaker 1>of robots so far.</v>

72
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.680
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

73
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.281
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

74
00:02:44.281 --> 00:02:45.960
<v Speaker 1>it's starting to ramp up really fast,</v>

75
00:02:45.961 --> 00:02:48.360
<v Speaker 1>but it's in large part because the things are embodied.</v>

76
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.040
<v Speaker 1>And so because it is the case as,</v>

77
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.080
<v Speaker 1>as we've discussed,</v>

78
00:02:52.081 --> 00:02:53.250
<v Speaker 1>that your,</v>

79
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:54.780
<v Speaker 1>your perceptual,</v>

80
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.810
<v Speaker 1>your cognitive perceptual motor systems have to be embedded in an output system</v>

81
00:02:59.971 --> 00:03:03.660
<v Speaker 1>that can interact with the world in order for them to be doing anything that's</v>

82
00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:04.920
<v Speaker 1>actual or real.</v>
