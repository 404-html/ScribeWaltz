00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.590
<v Speaker 1>Speaking of white privilege,</v>

2
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.690
<v Speaker 1>I have to share with you this because I,</v>

3
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm still in shock even though it happened a few years ago.</v>

5
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.880
<v Speaker 1>So when I was supervising students in my last position as a counselor to a</v>

6
00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:18.720
<v Speaker 1>women's shelter,</v>

7
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.460
<v Speaker 1>we had a few students every year you always get students from George Brown</v>

8
00:00:23.461 --> 00:00:25.680
<v Speaker 1>because they have that very specialized program.</v>

9
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.270
<v Speaker 1>It's basically specializing in being a counselor for assaulted women and</v>

10
00:00:30.271 --> 00:00:31.110
<v Speaker 1>children advocate.</v>

11
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:37.030
<v Speaker 1>My students told me that within the first week of class and the,</v>

12
00:00:37.341 --> 00:00:40.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if this is being done in all their classes,</v>

13
00:00:40.591 --> 00:00:42.150
<v Speaker 1>but certainly one or two of their classes,</v>

14
00:00:42.151 --> 00:00:45.780
<v Speaker 1>all the white students were asked to stand against the left side of the wall and</v>

15
00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:48.660
<v Speaker 1>all the students of color rosters and on the right side of the wall.</v>

16
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.490
<v Speaker 1>And then each and every white student had to basically take a step forward and</v>

17
00:00:53.491 --> 00:00:54.720
<v Speaker 1>talk about a,</v>

18
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.960
<v Speaker 1>how they benefited from white privilege and be almost like groveling and</v>

19
00:01:01.501 --> 00:01:02.880
<v Speaker 1>apologizing for what they,</v>

20
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.190
<v Speaker 1>for all the people of color.</v>

21
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.200
<v Speaker 1>That assistance.</v>

22
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.541
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

23
00:01:06.541 --> 00:01:06.991
<v Speaker 1>I have to get it.</v>

24
00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:08.610
<v Speaker 1>And I kept saying to them like,</v>

25
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.511
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

26
00:01:09.511 --> 00:01:13.620
<v Speaker 1>Like I was so shocked and stunned when I heard this and these are 17,</v>

27
00:01:13.621 --> 00:01:15.760
<v Speaker 1>18 year olds coming into you.</v>

28
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.530
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

29
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.650
<v Speaker 1>many of them were actually sort of coming in from the suburbs.</v>

30
00:01:19.651 --> 00:01:23.430
<v Speaker 1>They were very sheltered and they weren't even exposed to urban life and in</v>

31
00:01:23.431 --> 00:01:26.220
<v Speaker 1>their first week of college to be exposed to this.</v>

32
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.420
<v Speaker 1>I found it reprehensible and I was telling my friend about it,</v>

33
00:01:30.421 --> 00:01:31.710
<v Speaker 1>who's also a social worker.</v>

34
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.970
<v Speaker 1>She told me she went to George Brown and while she was waiting for the professor</v>

35
00:01:38.011 --> 00:01:41.250
<v Speaker 1>to finish with her lesson before she was going to speak to the class,</v>

36
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.810
<v Speaker 1>the professor reprimanded the class and said that even if Xiang Ghomeshi was</v>

37
00:01:45.811 --> 00:01:46.680
<v Speaker 1>found innocent,</v>

38
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.020
<v Speaker 1>we believe women period,</v>

39
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.800
<v Speaker 1>that that's,</v>

40
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.560
<v Speaker 1>that's her position and that should be the classes position,</v>

41
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.870
<v Speaker 1>so no respect for the law whatsoever.</v>

42
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.430
<v Speaker 2>What do you see that with the Ontario Human Rights Commission to which has</v>

43
00:01:58.431 --> 00:02:03.431
<v Speaker 2>placed itself outside normal jurisprudential practice because the people who run</v>

44
00:02:03.561 --> 00:02:07.880
<v Speaker 2>those organizations are convinced that English common law is nothing but an</v>

45
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.830
<v Speaker 2>oppressive patriarchal institution,</v>

46
00:02:09.831 --> 00:02:13.820
<v Speaker 2>which is exactly count runs exactly counter to the,</v>

47
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.470
<v Speaker 2>to the reality of the situation.</v>

48
00:02:15.471 --> 00:02:19.250
<v Speaker 2>English common law is an amazingly humane,</v>

49
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.280
<v Speaker 2>amazingly humane,</v>

50
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.660
<v Speaker 2>evolved system.</v>

51
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.990
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

52
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.471
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

53
00:02:24.471 --> 00:02:26.930
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the world's great achievements.</v>

54
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.910
<v Speaker 2>To think of it as a tool of patriarchal oppression is absurd.</v>

55
00:02:31.911 --> 00:02:33.020
<v Speaker 2>Beyond comprehension.</v>

56
00:02:33.021 --> 00:02:33.141
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

57
00:02:33.141 --> 00:02:33.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

58
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.950
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

59
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:34.700
<v Speaker 1>but then,</v>

60
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.810
<v Speaker 1>but Dr. Peterson,</v>

61
00:02:35.811 --> 00:02:38.330
<v Speaker 1>so then what happened is when a couple of students put up their hand,</v>

62
00:02:38.331 --> 00:02:38.541
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

63
00:02:38.541 --> 00:02:39.620
<v Speaker 1>this is a bloody college,</v>

64
00:02:39.621 --> 00:02:40.820
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to engage in dialogue,</v>

65
00:02:40.821 --> 00:02:43.130
<v Speaker 1>in rigorous debate and sort of said,</v>

66
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.491
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

67
00:02:43.491 --> 00:02:44.271
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

68
00:02:44.271 --> 00:02:45.670
<v Speaker 1>this man was found,</v>

69
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:46.670
<v Speaker 1>he was acquitted,</v>

70
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.130
<v Speaker 1>and we kind of have a legal system with a,</v>

71
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.000
<v Speaker 1>once you're acquitted and the professor just blasted them and said,</v>

72
00:02:53.001 --> 00:02:53.834
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

73
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.140
<v Speaker 1>regardless of the decisions made by the court,</v>

74
00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.560
<v Speaker 1>it is her position and she wants it to be the classes position that he is</v>

75
00:03:03.731 --> 00:03:04.240
<v Speaker 1>guilty.</v>

76
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.890
<v Speaker 1>The verdict has no relevance.</v>

77
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:06.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

78
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.701
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

79
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:10.630
<v Speaker 1>That is terrifying to me because it also speaks to the whole title nine what's</v>

80
00:03:10.631 --> 00:03:12.280
<v Speaker 1>happening in the u s and other like,</v>

81
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.593
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

82
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.430
<v Speaker 1>this is very terrifying.</v>

83
00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:17.140
<v Speaker 1>This is absolute indoctrination.</v>

84
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

85
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.620
<v Speaker 2>Well you ran,</v>

86
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.550
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that you have to add to this sort of debate as,</v>

87
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.541
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

88
00:03:24.541 --> 00:03:27.420
<v Speaker 2>I know that your family's experience in Canada,</v>

89
00:03:27.421 --> 00:03:28.860
<v Speaker 2>it was really pretty damn harsh.</v>

90
00:03:28.861 --> 00:03:29.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

91
00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.540
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly,</v>

92
00:03:30.541 --> 00:03:33.600
<v Speaker 2>your dad was one of the first people to wear a turban in Toronto and it was,</v>

93
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.480
<v Speaker 2>you guys had the misfortune of moving into a pretty rough,</v>

94
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

95
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.210
<v Speaker 2>working class neighborhood where there was some thugs after you won a fairly</v>

96
00:03:42.211 --> 00:03:43.140
<v Speaker 2>regular basis.</v>

97
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.000
<v Speaker 2>I know that you were featured in Macleans magazine on the cover consequence of</v>

98
00:03:48.001 --> 00:03:48.834
<v Speaker 2>all the,</v>

99
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.921
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

100
00:03:49.921 --> 00:03:53.060
<v Speaker 2>persecution that you endured and you were just a kid when that was happening.</v>

101
00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.750
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

102
00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.750
<v Speaker 1>My Dad was one of five men in a turban and this was 1970s,</v>

103
00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.540
<v Speaker 1>Toronto and we were living in sort of east Toronto at the time,</v>

104
00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.160
<v Speaker 1>the pape and Danforth area,</v>

105
00:04:01.161 --> 00:04:01.994
<v Speaker 1>but south of there.</v>

106
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:03.030
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

107
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.220
<v Speaker 1>and our home was vandalized and cars trashed and we were constantly bullied and</v>

108
00:04:07.221 --> 00:04:07.790
<v Speaker 1>attacked.</v>

109
00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.080
<v Speaker 1>And my dad was denied a job as a security guard at George Square because,</v>

110
00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:13.790
<v Speaker 1>because he wore a turban.</v>

111
00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.193
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

112
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.130
<v Speaker 1>but here's the thing,</v>

113
00:04:16.131 --> 00:04:16.911
<v Speaker 1>like my dad,</v>

114
00:04:16.911 --> 00:04:19.280
<v Speaker 1>my family that happened in the seventies and eighties,</v>

115
00:04:19.281 --> 00:04:23.060
<v Speaker 1>but we have never ever had a problem in the last 25 years.</v>

116
00:04:23.061 --> 00:04:24.770
<v Speaker 1>We have equal access to everything.</v>

117
00:04:24.771 --> 00:04:24.981
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

118
00:04:24.981 --> 00:04:28.400
<v Speaker 1>Jag meets thing is wearing a turban and he's the leader of the NDP.</v>

119
00:04:28.401 --> 00:04:31.880
<v Speaker 1>So Canada has changed drastically.</v>

120
00:04:31.881 --> 00:04:34.340
<v Speaker 1>And if I had to choose another country in the world to live in,</v>

121
00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.360
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't choose one.</v>

122
00:04:35.361 --> 00:04:37.310
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine a better place to live.</v>

123
00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:38.481
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>

124
00:04:38.481 --> 00:04:42.200
<v Speaker 1>horrible things happened and we were in Maclean's and we suffered immensely,</v>

125
00:04:42.201 --> 00:04:43.190
<v Speaker 1>especially my dad.</v>

126
00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:44.593
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

127
00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.950
<v Speaker 1>but this is what's amazing is Canada is now,</v>

128
00:04:48.951 --> 00:04:52.370
<v Speaker 1>I'd say like probably the least racist place on earth.</v>

129
00:04:52.371 --> 00:04:57.371
<v Speaker 1>Yet there are some people who are adamant that we are still living back in the</v>

130
00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.030
<v Speaker 1>fifties or sixties when things were unbearable for people of color.</v>

131
00:05:02.031 --> 00:05:03.080
<v Speaker 1>And that's just not true.</v>

132
00:05:03.081 --> 00:05:06.440
<v Speaker 1>And when I pointed out it's just not true and I know it because I've lived it.</v>

133
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm told I suffer from internalized colonialism and internalized racism.</v>

134
00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.670
<v Speaker 2>That's the classic leftist argument to anybody who fits one of their</v>

135
00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.000
<v Speaker 2>hypothetically victimized groups who dares to stand up and say,</v>

136
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.660
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

137
00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:21.261
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>

138
00:05:21.261 --> 00:05:25.250
<v Speaker 2>That's actually not been my experience and I'm really happy to be living here.</v>
