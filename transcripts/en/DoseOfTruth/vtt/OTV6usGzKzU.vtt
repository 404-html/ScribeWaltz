1
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.320
<v Speaker 1>There's this neuroscientist,</v>

2
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.790
<v Speaker 1>you're a psychologist named El Conan Goldberg,</v>

3
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.520
<v Speaker 1>and Goldberg was a student of Alexander Luria and Alexander Luria was a Russian</v>

4
00:00:17.521 --> 00:00:18.600
<v Speaker 1>neuropsychologist,</v>

5
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.000
<v Speaker 1>perhaps the foremost neuro psychologist of the mid to late 20th century.</v>

6
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.510
<v Speaker 1>And he had students Sokolov in vinegar Dova who discovered the orienting reflex.</v>

7
00:00:30.781 --> 00:00:31.351
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

8
00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:34.950
<v Speaker 1>the orienting reflects is the reflex that orients you win something anomalous,</v>

9
00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:37.230
<v Speaker 1>interferes with your goal directed behavior.</v>

10
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.850
<v Speaker 1>It's a major discovery,</v>

11
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.010
<v Speaker 1>like one of the,</v>

12
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.280
<v Speaker 1>one of the four or five most important discoveries that have ever been made in,</v>

13
00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:45.060
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

14
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.720
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

15
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.531
<v Speaker 1>in psychology,</v>

16
00:00:46.531 --> 00:00:46.861
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

17
00:00:46.861 --> 00:00:47.970
<v Speaker 1>certainly in neuroscience.</v>

18
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.150
<v Speaker 1>So Luria was a big deal and he was the first person who really established the</v>

19
00:00:53.311 --> 00:00:55.740
<v Speaker 1>functional role of the prefrontal Cortex as well.</v>

20
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.933
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

21
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.600
<v Speaker 1>and had it very nice overall view of how the brain functioned.</v>

22
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.050
<v Speaker 1>His book was written in 1980 and it's still,</v>

23
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.430
<v Speaker 1>there's still lost in it.</v>

24
00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:06.720
<v Speaker 1>That's really useful,</v>

25
00:01:06.721 --> 00:01:09.540
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty strange for a science that's advanced that quickly.</v>

26
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.823
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

27
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.830
<v Speaker 1>so Goldberg came from a great pedigree,</v>

28
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.000
<v Speaker 1>I believe Larry,</v>

29
00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:18.270
<v Speaker 1>his teacher was Pavlov,</v>

30
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.770
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly.</v>

31
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.540
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

32
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.883
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

33
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:27.910
<v Speaker 2>Goldberg,</v>

34
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.421
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:29.470
<v Speaker 1>you hear,</v>

36
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.920
<v Speaker 1>some of you may have heard the idea that the left hemisphere is more linguistic</v>

37
00:01:36.431 --> 00:01:39.730
<v Speaker 1>than the right hemisphere is that left hemisphere is specialized for language</v>

38
00:01:39.731 --> 00:01:44.170
<v Speaker 1>and the right hemisphere is specialized for nonverbal images,</v>

39
00:01:44.171 --> 00:01:45.190
<v Speaker 1>stick communication.</v>

40
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.960
<v Speaker 1>The left hemisphere has a pretty</v>

41
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.750
<v Speaker 1>well organized micro structure and the right hemisphere is more diffuse as well.</v>

42
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.213
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

43
00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.940
<v Speaker 1>that's true in lefthanded males in particular.</v>

44
00:01:57.941 --> 00:02:00.430
<v Speaker 1>So the circuitry can be switched around a bit,</v>

45
00:02:00.431 --> 00:02:01.480
<v Speaker 1>but it's okay.</v>

46
00:02:01.481 --> 00:02:03.310
<v Speaker 1>The modules are basically the same,</v>

47
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.840
<v Speaker 1>although they can be moved a little bit,</v>

48
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.920
<v Speaker 1>but Goldberg thought that it isn't language versus non language,</v>

49
00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.890
<v Speaker 1>it's routine versus novelty.</v>

50
00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.640
<v Speaker 1>And so the left hemisphere and there's a neuropsychologist physician named Roman</v>

51
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.410
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] who's done some very interesting work,</v>

52
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:21.743
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

53
00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.620
<v Speaker 1>that's pertinent to this.</v>

54
00:02:23.621 --> 00:02:25.180
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'll tell you a story about him.</v>

55
00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:26.643
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

56
00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.260
<v Speaker 1>Goldberg believed that the Right Hemisphere,</v>

57
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.690
<v Speaker 1>let's say you have very old systems underneath,</v>

58
00:02:34.691 --> 00:02:39.400
<v Speaker 1>boast both cortical hemispheres that do things like respond to anomaly to the</v>

59
00:02:39.401 --> 00:02:42.490
<v Speaker 1>thing that doesn't fit to the Predator in the distance.</v>

60
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.190
<v Speaker 1>Some of that's extraordinarily fast.</v>

61
00:02:45.191 --> 00:02:48.940
<v Speaker 1>So that would be like a snake reflects that can move you away from a snake in</v>

62
00:02:48.941 --> 00:02:50.710
<v Speaker 1>less time than it takes the snake to bite.</v>

63
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:51.880
<v Speaker 1>And it's really a reflex.</v>

64
00:02:51.881 --> 00:02:53.140
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even hit your brain.</v>

65
00:02:53.141 --> 00:02:54.580
<v Speaker 1>It's really super fast.</v>

66
00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.300
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a defensive crouch that's,</v>

67
00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.850
<v Speaker 1>that's instantiated higher up in the nervous system.</v>

68
00:03:00.851 --> 00:03:02.740
<v Speaker 1>But that's still remarkably fast.</v>

69
00:03:02.741 --> 00:03:05.190
<v Speaker 1>And then there's fear as an emotion and,</v>

70
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.450
<v Speaker 1>and the orientation of attention.</v>

71
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.380
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the cognitive processing and that all streams out across a</v>

72
00:03:11.381 --> 00:03:12.190
<v Speaker 1>timespan,</v>

73
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.401
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

74
00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:14.320
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that time span is half a second.</v>

75
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.100
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

76
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.500
<v Speaker 1>and that's really a long time if something is attacking you.</v>

77
00:03:17.501 --> 00:03:21.130
<v Speaker 1>So you got those initial responses are quite primitive,</v>

78
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.960
<v Speaker 1>but they're extraordinarily fast.</v>

79
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.041
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>

80
00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:28.870
<v Speaker 1>So there's subcortical structures that orient you towards novelty and prepare</v>

81
00:03:28.871 --> 00:03:30.070
<v Speaker 1>you for,</v>

82
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.320
<v Speaker 1>for freezing or for attending.</v>

83
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.280
<v Speaker 1>And the right hemisphere seems to be dominated by those systems.</v>

84
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.080
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that what happens is that something threatens you.</v>

85
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.310
<v Speaker 1>You Orient towards it.</v>

86
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.700
<v Speaker 1>The right hemisphere produces a bunch of images about what it might be.</v>

87
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.910
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that's what happens when a child is afraid of the dark.</v>

88
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.440
<v Speaker 1>The child's on the bed,</v>

89
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.580
<v Speaker 1>they're afraid of the dark,</v>

90
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.070
<v Speaker 1>they're crouched cause they're frozen like a prey animal.</v>

91
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.280
<v Speaker 1>And their right hemisphere is producing monsters to inhabit the darkness that</v>

92
00:04:00.011 --> 00:04:03.640
<v Speaker 1>are the child's hypotheses about what might be out there.</v>

93
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.103
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

94
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.670
<v Speaker 1>Because that's what you want to know,</v>

95
00:04:06.671 --> 00:04:07.504
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

96
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.560
<v Speaker 1>You want to know what's out there and then you want to know what to do about it.</v>

97
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.220
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you two kids' dreams that are sort of relevant to that.</v>

98
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.610
<v Speaker 1>So when my daughter was about three,</v>

99
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.910
<v Speaker 1>she came into the bedroom that my wife and I had and she was crying,</v>

100
00:04:24.611 --> 00:04:25.600
<v Speaker 1>she'd had a nightmare.</v>

101
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.900
<v Speaker 1>And she said that she saw a stream and there was garbage all over the street.</v>

102
00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.130
<v Speaker 1>And she didn't like that.</v>

103
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.540
<v Speaker 1>And so I sat her down and I said,</v>

104
00:04:34.541 --> 00:04:34.811
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

105
00:04:34.811 --> 00:04:37.930
<v Speaker 1>so imagine the stream with the garbage in it.</v>

106
00:04:37.931 --> 00:04:40.810
<v Speaker 1>Now imagine that you're taking the garbage out and throwing it in the garbage</v>

107
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.213
<v Speaker 1>bin.</v>

108
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.000
<v Speaker 1>And so she,</v>

109
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.480
<v Speaker 1>and I got her to like visualize that because that kind of puts her back in the</v>

110
00:04:46.481 --> 00:04:47.590
<v Speaker 1>semi dream state.</v>

111
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.710
<v Speaker 1>And then she cleaned up the mess and then she could go off to sleep.</v>

112
00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:51.490
<v Speaker 1>Now you,</v>

113
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:52.480
<v Speaker 1>you could tell the child,</v>

114
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.190
<v Speaker 1>don't worry about the dream isn't real.</v>

115
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.240
<v Speaker 1>But that's not,</v>

116
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.770
<v Speaker 1>that's true because it's not real.</v>

117
00:04:56.771 --> 00:04:59.140
<v Speaker 1>Like other day time things are,</v>

118
00:04:59.141 --> 00:05:01.120
<v Speaker 1>but it's not like it's not real.</v>

119
00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:02.283
<v Speaker 1>It's a dream.</v>

120
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.850
<v Speaker 1>Like a dream is real.</v>

121
00:05:03.851 --> 00:05:05.590
<v Speaker 1>It's just not the same kind of real.</v>

122
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.950
<v Speaker 1>And so what I did with her was to indicate to her practically that if she saw</v>

123
00:05:12.551 --> 00:05:13.630
<v Speaker 1>something anomalous,</v>

124
00:05:13.631 --> 00:05:15.310
<v Speaker 1>something that was out of place,</v>

125
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

126
00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:16.840
<v Speaker 1>Something that was a mass,</v>

127
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.720
<v Speaker 1>that it was within her capacity to set it.</v>

128
00:05:19.721 --> 00:05:20.554
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

129
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.521
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

130
00:05:21.521 --> 00:05:21.911
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

131
00:05:21.911 --> 00:05:22.211
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

132
00:05:22.211 --> 00:05:26.710
<v Speaker 1>so now your right hemisphere tells you what monster's might inhabit.</v>

133
00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:27.573
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

134
00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:28.720
<v Speaker 1>the darkness.</v>

135
00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.090
<v Speaker 1>Now what you have to do is figure out,</v>

136
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.680
<v Speaker 1>there's two things you have to figure out.</v>

137
00:05:32.681 --> 00:05:37.681
<v Speaker 1>One is what to do about it given monster and other is to do,</v>

138
00:05:38.351 --> 00:05:42.910
<v Speaker 1>what about is to figure out what to do about the class of all possible monsters,</v>

139
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.823
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

140
00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:45.940
<v Speaker 1>That's a whole different thing.</v>

141
00:05:45.941 --> 00:05:48.160
<v Speaker 1>That's something that only human beings are capable of.</v>

142
00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:49.660
<v Speaker 1>That level of abstraction.</v>

143
00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.591
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

144
00:05:50.591 --> 00:05:55.450
<v Speaker 1>And so what you might do about a particular monster is hide or go out and get</v>

145
00:05:55.451 --> 00:05:58.370
<v Speaker 1>rid of it if was just an actual animal.</v>

146
00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.233
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

147
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.390
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't help because they're sold the other potential predators that</v>

148
00:06:02.391 --> 00:06:03.224
<v Speaker 1>are still there.</v>

149
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:04.580
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe you can go hunt,</v>

150
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:05.540
<v Speaker 1>hold them down.</v>

151
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.450
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't help either because you can't hunt them all down.</v>

152
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.471
<v Speaker 1>It's not our,</v>

153
00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:10.700
<v Speaker 1>it's not very likely anyways.</v>

154
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.570
<v Speaker 1>So instead what you have to do is figure out how to configure yourself so that</v>

155
00:06:14.571 --> 00:06:18.200
<v Speaker 1>you're in the best possible position to fight off the monsters when they come.</v>

156
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:19.940
<v Speaker 1>That's your best bet.</v>
