1
00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:07.543
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.500
<v Speaker 1>Turns out to be true of chimpanzee.</v>

3
00:00:09.501 --> 00:00:10.650
<v Speaker 1>So Frans de Waal,</v>

4
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.340
<v Speaker 1>who is a Dutch primatologist,</v>

5
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.370
<v Speaker 1>very smart one too.</v>

6
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.580
<v Speaker 1>He's been interested in the biological basis of morality as well.</v>

7
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:18.210
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

8
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.560
<v Speaker 1>and he,</v>

9
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.020
<v Speaker 1>he's written a lot of good books on,</v>

10
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.450
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

11
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:21.450
<v Speaker 1>on primate behavior.</v>

12
00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:22.350
<v Speaker 1>Chimps in particular,</v>

13
00:00:22.351 --> 00:00:23.850
<v Speaker 1>chimps are brutal creatures,</v>

14
00:00:23.851 --> 00:00:24.684
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

15
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.890
<v Speaker 1>Like they go to war a.</v>

16
00:00:25.891 --> 00:00:29.880
<v Speaker 1>And so if you have a chimp territory out in the jungle,</v>

17
00:00:29.881 --> 00:00:30.330
<v Speaker 1>then the,</v>

18
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.250
<v Speaker 1>the juveniles will,</v>

19
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.400
<v Speaker 1>the males in particular the band together in groups of four or five.</v>

20
00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:38.100
<v Speaker 1>There's often but not always a female or two with them.</v>

21
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.520
<v Speaker 1>And if they come across chimps from another truth that aren't within their</v>

22
00:00:43.621 --> 00:00:44.221
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

23
00:00:44.221 --> 00:00:45.390
<v Speaker 1>let's say they will,</v>

24
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.811
<v Speaker 1>if they're,</v>

25
00:00:45.811 --> 00:00:46.780
<v Speaker 1>if they outnumber them,</v>

26
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.240
<v Speaker 1>cause they can't really count,</v>

27
00:00:48.241 --> 00:00:50.550
<v Speaker 1>but they can estimate magnitude visually.</v>

28
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.900
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same as counting.</v>

29
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.070
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

30
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.940
<v Speaker 1>but if they outnumber them,</v>

31
00:00:53.941 --> 00:00:55.770
<v Speaker 1>they will tear them to pieces.</v>

32
00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.270
<v Speaker 1>And chimps serve at least twice as strong as a really well developed human male.</v>

33
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.400
<v Speaker 1>And so they can tear you up pretty good.</v>

34
00:01:02.401 --> 00:01:04.230
<v Speaker 1>And chimps are perfectly capable.</v>

35
00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:05.350
<v Speaker 1>They hunt there,</v>

36
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.223
<v Speaker 1>they're carnivorous.</v>

37
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.670
<v Speaker 1>I like human beings and they hunt.</v>

38
00:01:08.671 --> 00:01:12.300
<v Speaker 1>They hunt colobus monkeys often they weigh about 40 pounds and they'll basically</v>

39
00:01:12.301 --> 00:01:17.301
<v Speaker 1>eat them alive at monkeys screaming away like mad cause you know it's in pain</v>

40
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.480
<v Speaker 1>cause it's being eaten.</v>

41
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:19.890
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

42
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.840
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't slow the chimps down a bit.</v>

43
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.410
<v Speaker 1>There's no cross species empathy stopping them from having their snack.</v>

44
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.700
<v Speaker 1>And so chimps are very brutal creatures and uh,</v>

45
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.810
<v Speaker 1>it isn't obvious they have a lot of internal inhibition of their aggression at</v>

46
00:01:33.811 --> 00:01:34.051
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

47
00:01:34.051 --> 00:01:36.750
<v Speaker 1>Most of the inhibition is sociological.</v>

48
00:01:36.751 --> 00:01:38.190
<v Speaker 1>It's out in the hierarchy.</v>

49
00:01:38.191 --> 00:01:41.580
<v Speaker 1>And so the reason chimps aren't always aggressive with one another is because</v>

50
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.200
<v Speaker 1>they know who can pound them and,</v>

51
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.200
<v Speaker 1>and who will gang up on them and who won't.</v>

52
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.530
<v Speaker 1>They establish their hierarchy.</v>

53
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:47.753
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>

54
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:49.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

55
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.970
<v Speaker 1>you think about a champ hierarchy and you're talking about a fairly strong and</v>

56
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:54.210
<v Speaker 1>aggressive creature.</v>

57
00:01:54.211 --> 00:01:55.260
<v Speaker 1>You might think it's biggest,</v>

58
00:01:55.261 --> 00:01:56.010
<v Speaker 1>ugliest,</v>

59
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.850
<v Speaker 1>meanest,</v>

60
00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.010
<v Speaker 1>most vicious,</v>

61
00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.940
<v Speaker 1>irritable,</v>

62
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.700
<v Speaker 1>unpleasant chimp that rises to the top.</v>

63
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.730
<v Speaker 1>While that's kind of the postmodernist view of human society,</v>

64
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.170
<v Speaker 1>but that's not the case.</v>

65
00:02:07.171 --> 00:02:08.310
<v Speaker 1>It happens sometimes.</v>

66
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.720
<v Speaker 1>But what happens,</v>

67
00:02:09.721 --> 00:02:11.610
<v Speaker 1>and dwell has documented this quite nicely,</v>

68
00:02:11.611 --> 00:02:13.110
<v Speaker 1>is that tyrant,</v>

69
00:02:13.111 --> 00:02:16.080
<v Speaker 1>chimps lead unstable regimes.</v>

70
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.681
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

71
00:02:16.681 --> 00:02:17.514
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

72
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.160
<v Speaker 1>that might sound familiar because the same thing,</v>

73
00:02:20.161 --> 00:02:21.720
<v Speaker 1>of course it's true human beings.</v>

74
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:22.681
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>

75
00:02:22.681 --> 00:02:22.831
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

76
00:02:22.831 --> 00:02:23.910
<v Speaker 1>it's because you know,</v>

77
00:02:23.911 --> 00:02:27.090
<v Speaker 1>people don't like tyrants and chimps don't like them that much either.</v>

78
00:02:27.091 --> 00:02:30.390
<v Speaker 1>And chimps are actually quite reciprocal in their social interactions.</v>

79
00:02:30.391 --> 00:02:32.130
<v Speaker 1>So they don't just dominate each other.</v>

80
00:02:32.131 --> 00:02:33.090
<v Speaker 1>They groom each other,</v>

81
00:02:33.091 --> 00:02:34.230
<v Speaker 1>they have friendships,</v>

82
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.500
<v Speaker 1>they can track social relationships over very long periods of time.</v>

83
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.400
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

84
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.540
<v Speaker 1>and they do that.</v>

85
00:02:39.541 --> 00:02:43.500
<v Speaker 1>And so they engage in reciprocal interactions,</v>

86
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.350
<v Speaker 1>let's say prosocial reciprocal interactions.</v>

87
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:47.431
<v Speaker 1>And you might think,</v>

88
00:02:47.431 --> 00:02:48.000
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

89
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.990
<v Speaker 1>what's the,</v>

90
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.420
<v Speaker 1>what's the weak point of the biggest,</v>

91
00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:51.901
<v Speaker 1>ugliest,</v>

92
00:02:51.901 --> 00:02:53.580
<v Speaker 1>toughest chimp in the troop?</v>

93
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:54.211
<v Speaker 1>And that is,</v>

94
00:02:54.211 --> 00:02:55.650
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't have any friends.</v>

95
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.731
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

96
00:02:56.731 --> 00:02:57.031
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

97
00:02:57.031 --> 00:02:58.740
<v Speaker 1>maybe has a bad day,</v>

98
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.830
<v Speaker 1>he's a little hung over or whatever for meat and fermented bananas or whatever</v>

99
00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:04.300
<v Speaker 1>he is partying with.</v>

100
00:03:04.301 --> 00:03:06.590
<v Speaker 1>And two of the slightly less ugly,</v>

101
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.290
<v Speaker 1>less slightly less mean,</v>

102
00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:09.071
<v Speaker 1>chimps decide,</v>

103
00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:10.870
<v Speaker 1>well this is a good time to take 'em out.</v>

104
00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:12.220
<v Speaker 1>And they tear him to pieces.</v>

105
00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.720
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

106
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.390
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things do all his pointed out quite nicely,</v>

107
00:03:16.391 --> 00:03:20.010
<v Speaker 1>is that if you want to have a stable chimp dominance hierarchy,</v>

108
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.430
<v Speaker 1>let's call it a regime,</v>

109
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.260
<v Speaker 1>the stable ones aren't ruled by the tyrants because the tyrants get taken out</v>

110
00:03:26.261 --> 00:03:27.094
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>

111
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.410
<v Speaker 1>by paired up friendship dyad,</v>

112
00:03:30.411 --> 00:03:31.600
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

113
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.580
<v Speaker 1>So that's really worth thinking about too,</v>

114
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:34.443
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

115
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:35.343
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

116
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.300
<v Speaker 1>because it indicates that even in creatures that have less complex sociological</v>

117
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:45.653
<v Speaker 1>orders,</v>

118
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.531
<v Speaker 1>and they do,</v>

119
00:03:46.531 --> 00:03:49.950
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things that predicts how complex your social order is,</v>

120
00:03:49.951 --> 00:03:52.110
<v Speaker 1>is how big your brain is compared to your body.</v>

121
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.910
<v Speaker 1>It's encephalization essentially.</v>

122
00:03:53.911 --> 00:03:55.770
<v Speaker 1>And the more encephalitis to creature,</v>

123
00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.110
<v Speaker 1>the larger the social groups it can track.</v>

124
00:03:58.111 --> 00:03:58.561
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>

125
00:03:58.561 --> 00:04:00.240
<v Speaker 1>human beings are very highly encephalite.</v>

126
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.830
<v Speaker 1>So we have quite complicated group.</v>

127
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

128
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.430
<v Speaker 1>we have quite complicated group organizations,</v>

129
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.940
<v Speaker 1>but even in simpler group organizations like the chimps,</v>

130
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.870
<v Speaker 1>it isn't the tyrant who rules stabling.</v>

131
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.510
<v Speaker 1>And that turns out to be also incredibly important.</v>
