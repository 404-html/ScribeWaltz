00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.640
<v Speaker 1>99 I started at Queens University taught,</v>

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:05.840
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.840
<v Speaker 1>you were protested or testers interrupted your talk at the beginning.</v>

4
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.960
<v Speaker 1>I believe you were spurred to them as narcissistic for infringing upon the</v>

5
00:00:15.961 --> 00:00:18.900
<v Speaker 1>rights of the people that were there to hear you speak.</v>

6
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.520
<v Speaker 1>They were taking that away from them.</v>

7
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:21.660
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

8
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.440
<v Speaker 1>in our country.</v>

9
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.221
<v Speaker 1>Just recently,</v>

10
00:00:23.221 --> 00:00:26.100
<v Speaker 1>we had an unarmed man shot in his back yard.</v>

11
00:00:26.101 --> 00:00:27.120
<v Speaker 1>20 Times.</v>

12
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.570
<v Speaker 1>People protested that they shut down highways,</v>

13
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.170
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

14
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.740
<v Speaker 1>being infringed on the rights of people to use those highways because they</v>

15
00:00:34.741 --> 00:00:38.250
<v Speaker 1>wanted to draw attention to this really horrible incident.</v>

16
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm asking you when is it okay to protest and in your own mind,</v>

17
00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:47.070
<v Speaker 1>how do you see a successful protest?</v>

18
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.810
<v Speaker 1>You protest</v>

19
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.230
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

20
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.030
<v Speaker 1>it's okay to protest when you're wanting to take responsibility for the</v>

21
00:01:03.031 --> 00:01:04.020
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>

22
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.670
<v Speaker 1>No one [inaudible]</v>

23
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.510
<v Speaker 1>protests.</v>

24
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.280
<v Speaker 1>Dave take absolutely no responsibility whatsoever for the consequences of the</v>

25
00:01:17.281 --> 00:01:18.114
<v Speaker 1>Raj.</v>

26
00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.340
<v Speaker 1>And so I think it's mostly cheap virtually.</v>

27
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.211
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

28
00:01:22.211 --> 00:01:25.210
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean that there isn't time diamond protest.</v>

29
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

30
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.400
<v Speaker 1>I protested,</v>

31
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.240
<v Speaker 1>I suppose the one nine,</v>

32
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.761
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>

33
00:01:27.761 --> 00:01:28.594
<v Speaker 1>nine video.</v>

34
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

35
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.610
<v Speaker 1>I was a form of protest.</v>

36
00:01:30.611 --> 00:01:31.810
<v Speaker 1>It was more of a refusal,</v>

37
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.050
<v Speaker 1>but I was perfectly willing to take the consequences of what I did.</v>

38
00:01:35.051 --> 00:01:37.310
<v Speaker 1>And I put myself in a situation where that was high,</v>

39
00:01:37.311 --> 00:01:38.144
<v Speaker 1>no problem.</v>

40
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:39.790
<v Speaker 1>So let's see if you tell,</v>

41
00:01:39.791 --> 00:01:41.710
<v Speaker 1>it was just with the book called skin,</v>

42
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.150
<v Speaker 1>skin in the game,</v>

43
00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.111
<v Speaker 1>we're helping clients,</v>

44
00:01:44.111 --> 00:01:45.340
<v Speaker 1>this is some detail,</v>

45
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.930
<v Speaker 1>you should only trust people who are putting themselves on the line when they,</v>

46
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.820
<v Speaker 1>when they make a recommendation.</v>

47
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.180
<v Speaker 1>And so the problem with protests that if there is anything invalid,</v>

48
00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.330
<v Speaker 1>the moment protest,</v>

49
00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.120
<v Speaker 1>the problem with protest as far as I can tell,</v>

50
00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:05.890
<v Speaker 1>is that it's become the only avenue to public virtue that seems to be acceptable</v>

51
00:02:05.891 --> 00:02:07.000
<v Speaker 1>in our society.</v>

52
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.110
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's [inaudible].</v>

53
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.851
<v Speaker 1>I hate to lose.</v>

54
00:02:18.851 --> 00:02:22.840
<v Speaker 1>The students are taught by their professors to be activists.</v>

55
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.980
<v Speaker 1>It's like when did the activists become like a profession?</v>

56
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.860
<v Speaker 1>As long as it's,</v>

57
00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to say about it either.</v>

58
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:34.723
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>

59
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.220
<v Speaker 1>pathological hanging from the 1960s is really</v>

60
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.930
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

61
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.900
<v Speaker 1>Under that you have a tremendous amount of breath.</v>

62
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:50.683
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>

63
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.140
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

64
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.973
<v Speaker 1>That was already</v>

65
00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.830
<v Speaker 1>your whole life.</v>

66
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.340
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

67
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.910
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

68
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:01.240
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

69
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.870
<v Speaker 1>we have,</v>

70
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.470
<v Speaker 1>I guess what I'll be charitable and call a dialogue going on about guns right</v>

71
00:03:05.471 --> 00:03:05.980
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

72
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:06.813
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

73
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.170
<v Speaker 1>and mental health,</v>

74
00:03:08.171 --> 00:03:09.520
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's also tied in with it.</v>

75
00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:11.170
<v Speaker 1>And you mentioned that,</v>

76
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.710
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

77
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.070
<v Speaker 1>essentially that the people that commit these kind of massacres that we're</v>

78
00:03:15.071 --> 00:03:16.330
<v Speaker 1>seeing are,</v>

79
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.740
<v Speaker 1>it's addapp determined malevolence um,</v>

80
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:19.990
<v Speaker 1>and it seems to me that,</v>

81
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.201
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

82
00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:22.510
<v Speaker 1>we're looking for simple answers to simple questions.</v>

83
00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:23.683
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

84
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.180
<v Speaker 1>and what I'm seeing,</v>

85
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.540
<v Speaker 1>and I guess kind of the preface a little bit is I believe that the second</v>

86
00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:32.080
<v Speaker 1>amendment is not just to help us protect ourselves against those kinds of people</v>

87
00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:33.130
<v Speaker 1>who would do us harm,</v>

88
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.200
<v Speaker 1>but also to protect against tyranny.</v>

89
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.390
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

90
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.430
<v Speaker 1>hospital could get the simple answers to simple questions if these people are</v>

91
00:03:49.431 --> 00:03:52.640
<v Speaker 1>determined to be 11 on tend to commit acts of destruction.</v>

92
00:03:52.641 --> 00:03:57.641
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think that we can realistically do about the situation?</v>

93
00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

94
00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:02.360
<v Speaker 1>Well the first thing is,</v>

95
00:04:02.361 --> 00:04:05.660
<v Speaker 1>is that I think it's just a state to set up a society where the only people that</v>

96
00:04:05.661 --> 00:04:06.860
<v Speaker 1>get to be dangerous,</v>

97
00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:07.371
<v Speaker 1>perpendicular,</v>

98
00:04:07.371 --> 00:04:08.420
<v Speaker 1>who worked for the government</v>

99
00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.990
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

100
00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.980
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the reason I say to is because I think that was more dangerous.</v>

101
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.873
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>

102
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.220
<v Speaker 1>Now what can we do about it?</v>

103
00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.083
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

104
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.380
<v Speaker 1>I see the bounce shootings as a psychological trauma.</v>

105
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.850
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally it's a multifaceted problem.</v>

106
00:04:37.851 --> 00:04:38.111
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

107
00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:38.891
<v Speaker 1>the first thing is,</v>

108
00:04:38.891 --> 00:04:43.370
<v Speaker 1>is that there's a fair bit of narcissism driving into like pathological</v>

109
00:04:43.371 --> 00:04:46.080
<v Speaker 1>narcissism because the people who do the amount of shootings,</v>

110
00:04:46.081 --> 00:04:49.200
<v Speaker 1>they're all aware of one another and it's a competition which established</v>

111
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.970
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>

112
00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.750
<v Speaker 1>Each one tries to outdo the last one and it's not like they're aching or,</v>

113
00:04:53.751 --> 00:04:54.690
<v Speaker 1>and they follow,</v>

114
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.180
<v Speaker 1>they follow,</v>

115
00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.510
<v Speaker 1>they're informed about such things.</v>

116
00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:00.980
<v Speaker 1>They're dwelling on it.</v>

117
00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.760
<v Speaker 1>And so they found a loophole in the press essentially ranked because they found</v>

118
00:05:07.911 --> 00:05:09.950
<v Speaker 1>a pathway to easy notoriety.</v>

119
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.470
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of the fantasizing that goes on,</v>

120
00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.970
<v Speaker 1>it's like the fantasizing that the proceeds out of the level of suicide.</v>

121
00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.730
<v Speaker 1>So on 11,</v>

122
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.440
<v Speaker 1>suicide is one that you commit when you're trying to take revenge on people that</v>

123
00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:22.430
<v Speaker 1>you think of wrongdoing,</v>

124
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:23.420
<v Speaker 1>like your family.</v>

125
00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.400
<v Speaker 1>And then you have a fantasy about you at the funeral in your coffin.</v>

126
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.881
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

127
00:05:28.881 --> 00:05:31.880
<v Speaker 1>looking so pure white and everyone that's ever wrong view,</v>

128
00:05:31.881 --> 00:05:34.210
<v Speaker 1>crying their eyes out and be uh,</v>

129
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

130
00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.030
<v Speaker 1>feeling deep regretted how they groaned you.</v>

131
00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:38.031
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

132
00:05:38.031 --> 00:05:39.200
<v Speaker 1>So that's a,</v>

133
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.210
<v Speaker 1>there's a fantasy that goes along with that.</v>

134
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.720
<v Speaker 1>There's anything,</v>

135
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:41.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

136
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.560
<v Speaker 1>fantasies it's a kid without that goes along with the school shooter types.</v>

137
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:46.161
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

138
00:05:46.161 --> 00:05:46.781
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

139
00:05:46.781 --> 00:05:50.990
<v Speaker 1>they think about their post death cells cause they usually shoot themselves</v>

140
00:05:50.991 --> 00:05:53.750
<v Speaker 1>because that's another way of showing cause he fake here.</v>

141
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.111
<v Speaker 1>Here's a,</v>

142
00:05:54.111 --> 00:05:54.944
<v Speaker 1>here's a mystery.</v>

143
00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:56.810
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to shoot yourself,</v>

144
00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.990
<v Speaker 1>why don't you do that before you shoot?</v>

145
00:05:59.991 --> 00:06:03.240
<v Speaker 1>Because they see other people and just say if everyone that trouble right,</v>

146
00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:06.500
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

147
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.810
<v Speaker 1>if you're out for your own demise,</v>

148
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.020
<v Speaker 1>why go other dragging me some other people loan with you?</v>

149
00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:13.580
<v Speaker 1>You have to contend with them.</v>

150
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.911
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

151
00:06:13.911 --> 00:06:16.090
<v Speaker 1>it's more dramatic because you're,</v>

152
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:16.731
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

153
00:06:16.731 --> 00:06:21.350
<v Speaker 1>what you're trying to manifest in the world is that proclamation that life</v>

154
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.670
<v Speaker 1>itself is contemptible even yours.</v>

155
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.421
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

156
00:06:26.421 --> 00:06:29.540
<v Speaker 1>And so you shoot about general other people to make them a whole contemptible</v>

157
00:06:29.541 --> 00:06:29.901
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>

158
00:06:29.901 --> 00:06:31.340
<v Speaker 1>but they do it off.</v>

159
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:35.900
<v Speaker 1>But then what's underlying that is this post death fantasy about how now you've</v>

160
00:06:35.901 --> 00:06:36.581
<v Speaker 1>meet Cory,</v>

161
00:06:36.581 --> 00:06:39.920
<v Speaker 1>it's you have $100 million worth of free publicity.</v>

162
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.900
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knows your name if you're at the peak of the evil hierarchy,</v>

163
00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:44.990
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

164
00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:47.300
<v Speaker 1>And the press plays right into that.</v>

165
00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.550
<v Speaker 1>And I'm shaking my finger at the press.</v>

166
00:06:49.551 --> 00:06:53.210
<v Speaker 1>It's a very complicated problem because even if the main street press decided</v>

167
00:06:53.211 --> 00:06:56.540
<v Speaker 1>that they weren't going to save the names of the shooters,</v>

168
00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.190
<v Speaker 1>which would be a very good idea,</v>

169
00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that would stop the damage from being pumped facades.</v>

170
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:02.721
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

171
00:07:02.721 --> 00:07:05.330
<v Speaker 1>So it's a complicated technical problem.</v>

172
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:09.980
<v Speaker 1>I would say off the psychological front 12 that's the sort of discussion we're</v>

173
00:07:09.981 --> 00:07:10.814
<v Speaker 1>having tonight.</v>

174
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:16.270
<v Speaker 1>We need to have a discussion about why it's wrong to take malevolent revenge</v>

175
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:20.780
<v Speaker 1>because there's reasons for it,</v>

176
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.690
<v Speaker 1>but it's wrong.</v>

177
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can understand it.</v>

178
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:25.881
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

179
00:07:25.881 --> 00:07:29.530
<v Speaker 1>you see there's outpourings of sympathy often for the school shooter types.</v>

180
00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:29.751
<v Speaker 1>All,</v>

181
00:07:29.751 --> 00:07:31.730
<v Speaker 1>they must have been terribly bullied.</v>

182
00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:32.301
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

183
00:07:32.301 --> 00:07:32.630
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

184
00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:36.770
<v Speaker 1>how many of you were terribly bullied when it's like 50% of you?</v>

185
00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:37.611
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

186
00:07:37.611 --> 00:07:40.250
<v Speaker 1>it's like you don't go out and shoot up a high school,</v>

187
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:41.970
<v Speaker 1>you know who sold it.</v>

188
00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:42.770
<v Speaker 1>It's it.</v>

189
00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:43.910
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

190
00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:45.800
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

191
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.240
<v Speaker 1>perhaps they were bullied,</v>

192
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:49.370
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't justify the actions.</v>

193
00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:53.720
<v Speaker 1>We need to have a serious discussion about why it doesn't justify their actions.</v>

194
00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:58.960
<v Speaker 1>And it's something like you don't get to multiply your misery and inflicted on</v>

195
00:07:59.631 --> 00:08:00.530
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

196
00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:03.500
<v Speaker 1>That's wrong even though it's understandable,</v>

197
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.360
<v Speaker 1>it's wrong.</v>

198
00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:06.021
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

199
00:08:06.021 --> 00:08:09.110
<v Speaker 1>you'd think that maybe we could have a serious discussion about this is the</v>

200
00:08:09.111 --> 00:08:09.621
<v Speaker 1>schools,</v>

201
00:08:09.621 --> 00:08:10.161
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>

202
00:08:10.161 --> 00:08:10.460
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

203
00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:10.790
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

204
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:14.000
<v Speaker 1>The problem that would happen is like zero but don't.</v>

205
00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:15.980
<v Speaker 1>But online you can have the discussion.</v>

206
00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:16.401
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

207
00:08:16.401 --> 00:08:18.170
<v Speaker 1>part of the reasons that people had been.</v>

208
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:19.040
<v Speaker 1>Please,</v>

209
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.570
<v Speaker 1>I suppose with my lectures.</v>

210
00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:20.900
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

211
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:24.560
<v Speaker 1>they're very strange things to be pleased about this because I do address these</v>

212
00:08:24.561 --> 00:08:26.060
<v Speaker 1>things rather bluntly.</v>

213
00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:31.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like life is hard and people have a massive capacity for evil,</v>

214
00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:34.910
<v Speaker 1>and it's no wonder that everyone's angry.</v>

215
00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:36.440
<v Speaker 1>What's your point?</v>

216
00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.240
<v Speaker 1>And to make it worse,</v>

217
00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:39.530
<v Speaker 1>that's your plan.</v>

218
00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:40.131
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

219
00:08:40.131 --> 00:08:41.150
<v Speaker 1>that's just not a year.</v>

220
00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:43.370
<v Speaker 1>That's his weak and the pathological.</v>

221
00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:44.630
<v Speaker 1>It's pathetic.</v>

222
00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:45.710
<v Speaker 1>It's cowardly.</v>

223
00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:47.510
<v Speaker 1>It's not to be countenanced.</v>

224
00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.361
<v Speaker 1>It's nothing too.</v>

225
00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:49.190
<v Speaker 1>Amen.</v>

226
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:50.950
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing heroic about,</v>

227
00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:52.730
<v Speaker 1>it's wrong.</v>

228
00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:53.451
<v Speaker 1>It's wrong,</v>

229
00:08:53.451 --> 00:08:55.560
<v Speaker 1>because it makes everything into hell.</v>

230
00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:00.630
<v Speaker 1>And so you need to have serious conversation about that.</v>

231
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:03.390
<v Speaker 1>Tonight is a serious conversation about that.</v>

232
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:04.610
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

233
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:10.100
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
