1
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.750
<v Speaker 1>What happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the academy has,</v>

2
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.360
<v Speaker 1>has always leaned left in the 20th</v>
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>

3
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.780
<v Speaker 1>but leaning isn't the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people think,</v>

4
00:00:17.781 --> 00:00:19.640
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>viewpoint diversity we need,</v>

5
00:00:19.641 --> 00:00:21.230
<v Speaker 1>we need everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need Nazis.</v>

6
00:00:21.231 --> 00:00:22.280
<v Speaker 1>We need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

7
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.880
<v Speaker 1>we don't need everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we need is no orthodoxy.</v>

8
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.880
<v Speaker 1>That's what's fatal orthodoxy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you have a,</v>

9
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.040
<v Speaker 1>if you have a field like sociology or</v>
<v Speaker 1>social psychology in which it's two or</v>

10
00:00:34.041 --> 00:00:36.650
<v Speaker 1>three to one left to right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's totally fine with me.</v>

11
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.210
<v Speaker 1>That's totally fine because if someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes some claim that's just like</v>

12
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.420
<v Speaker 1>ideologically blind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone will say,</v>

13
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:45.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.290
<v Speaker 1>common sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other evidence that you've missed and</v>

15
00:00:48.291 --> 00:00:51.950
<v Speaker 1>then the system works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what I learned when I started down</v>

16
00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:55.310
<v Speaker 1>this road in 2011,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gave a talk at the big conference with</v>

17
00:00:55.311 --> 00:00:58.400
<v Speaker 1>social psychologists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gave a talk about this problem that</v>

18
00:00:58.401 --> 00:01:02.510
<v Speaker 1>we're losing our diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I could only find one conservative</v>

19
00:01:02.511 --> 00:01:03.530
<v Speaker 1>in the entire field.</v>

20
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.710
<v Speaker 1>And I gave a talk on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

21
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.770
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

22
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.080
<v Speaker 1>and so what I've learned since then is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the ratio in psychology was between</v>

23
00:01:15.801 --> 00:01:17.450
<v Speaker 1>two to one and four to one left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

24
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.590
<v Speaker 1>All the way up to the early nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've gathered together all of the</v>

25
00:01:20.591 --> 00:01:22.790
<v Speaker 1>studies we could find.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all the up to the early nineties,</v>

26
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.530
<v Speaker 1>it's only three or four to one left to</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

27
00:01:24.531 --> 00:01:26.300
<v Speaker 1>which would be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

28
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.360
<v Speaker 1>but then between 1995 or four and 2010,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes to a 14 to one.</v>

29
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.350
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any idea why and why that</v>
<v Speaker 1>time?</v>

30
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.060
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

31
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.490
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you get the same story whether you</v>

32
00:01:40.491 --> 00:01:43.640
<v Speaker 1>look at Republican,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Democrat ratios or liberal conservative</v>

33
00:01:43.641 --> 00:01:44.810
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tell the same story.</v>

34
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.370
<v Speaker 1>So the two of the big things going on</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are one is that the greatest</v>

35
00:01:49.371 --> 00:01:51.350
<v Speaker 1>generation which had a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Republicans,</v>

36
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.350
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a lot of men go off to World War II.</v>

37
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.590
<v Speaker 1>They are there on the Gi bill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They entered the academy in the 19</v>

38
00:01:57.591 --> 00:02:00.020
<v Speaker 1>fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them are conservative or</v>

39
00:02:00.021 --> 00:02:02.420
<v Speaker 1>Republican and so you have a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

40
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.930
<v Speaker 1>but in the sixties and seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the main reasons to go to Grad</v>

41
00:02:05.931 --> 00:02:10.931
<v Speaker 1>school and the social sciences is either</v>
<v Speaker 1>a to stay in school to escape the</v>

42
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.480
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam war draft or be to fight for</v>
<v Speaker 1>social justice and against racism.</v>

43
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.170
<v Speaker 1>So in sociology and psychology in</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular and political science maybe</v>

44
00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:21.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get a huge influx of left leaning</v>

45
00:02:21.081 --> 00:02:26.081
<v Speaker 1>people who are there to pursue social</v>
<v Speaker 1>justice so you know the motives are fine</v>

46
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.850
<v Speaker 1>and if it was balanced to be totally</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>

47
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.620
<v Speaker 1>but as you get these young junior people</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the left come in in the seventies and</v>

48
00:02:33.621 --> 00:02:36.440
<v Speaker 1>eighties and then you get the older</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are more politically</v>

49
00:02:36.441 --> 00:02:38.210
<v Speaker 1>balanced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>retiring of the eighties and nineties.</v>

50
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.980
<v Speaker 1>By the time you get to the late nineties</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all baby boomers and so do you get</v>

51
00:02:42.981 --> 00:02:44.840
<v Speaker 1>a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get a positive feedback loop</v>

52
00:02:44.841 --> 00:02:46.280
<v Speaker 1>developing their.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you said,</v>

53
00:02:46.281 --> 00:02:47.930
<v Speaker 1>if it's like three to one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's okay,</v>

54
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.140
<v Speaker 1>but maybe when it hits four to one it</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes to like 20 to one.</v>

55
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.100
<v Speaker 1>Then you stick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

56
00:02:52.101 --> 00:02:54.440
<v Speaker 1>So then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then you start getting hostile</v>

57
00:02:54.441 --> 00:02:57.080
<v Speaker 1>climate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I wrote a review paper on this with</v>

58
00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.120
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Joe Duarte and Phil and lead Justin</v>

59
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.830
<v Speaker 1>Jarrett,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crawford,</v>

60
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.130
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

61
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.730
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

62
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.160
<v Speaker 1>and we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

63
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.360
<v Speaker 1>we reviewed everything that we could</v>
<v Speaker 1>find and we concluded that most of</v>

64
00:03:10.361 --> 00:03:13.990
<v Speaker 1>what's going on is self selection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is people on the left are more open</v>

65
00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:16.180
<v Speaker 1>to experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're always going to get self</v>

66
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:18.850
<v Speaker 1>selection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there's really good evidence</v>

67
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.500
<v Speaker 1>that there's also hostile climate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

68
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.820
<v Speaker 1>it's undeniable now that if you are not</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the left in a Grad program,</v>

69
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.810
<v Speaker 1>there's just constant little subtle or</v>
<v Speaker 1>not so subtle reminders that you don't</v>

70
00:03:28.811 --> 00:03:29.520
<v Speaker 1>belong.</v>

71
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.900
<v Speaker 1>And in the academy we're all about</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

72
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.360
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there are subtle hints here and</v>

73
00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:35.530
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't succeed.</v>

74
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.101
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

75
00:03:36.101 --> 00:03:39.070
<v Speaker 1>that's what we do for a living is when</v>
<v Speaker 1>we say that little things will stop</v>

76
00:03:39.071 --> 00:03:40.380
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

77
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.740
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little things are put in the way of</v>

78
00:03:41.741 --> 00:03:44.170
<v Speaker 1>anyone who doesn't fit politically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

79
00:03:44.171 --> 00:03:46.990
<v Speaker 1>and so you do get hostile climate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do get over discrimination.</v>

80
00:03:46.991 --> 00:03:49.510
<v Speaker 1>There's evidence of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there is also,</v>

81
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.500
<v Speaker 1>it is part of the story here that what</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means to be a conservative in the</v>

82
00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:55.510
<v Speaker 1>nineties and especially 2000 has</v>
<v Speaker 1>changed.</v>

83
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.410
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

84
00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.780
<v Speaker 1>it is true that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

85
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.010
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conservative,</v>

86
00:04:00.011 --> 00:04:02.700
<v Speaker 1>we're not in any way anti-science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

87
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.450
<v Speaker 1>until much more recent times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now actually both sides are anti-science</v>

88
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.910
<v Speaker 1>about different sciences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm in America,</v>

89
00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.940
<v Speaker 1>the right wing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Republican Party has,</v>

90
00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.330
<v Speaker 1>it's controversial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do believe that the polarization</v>

91
00:04:16.331 --> 00:04:18.100
<v Speaker 1>starts with the right moving further</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

92
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.880
<v Speaker 1>So what it means to be conservative to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the anti anti evolutionary,</v>

93
00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.700
<v Speaker 1>which is actually what's happening on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the left now to exactly.</v>

94
00:04:23.701 --> 00:04:24.010
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

95
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.460
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well as modern laptop to Bret Weinstein</v>

96
00:04:26.461 --> 00:04:27.750
<v Speaker 1>the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

97
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.320
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

98
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.850
<v Speaker 1>one of his claims is that evolutionary</v>
<v Speaker 1>biology has something in it to offend</v>

99
00:04:32.851 --> 00:04:34.640
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a,</v>

100
00:04:34.641 --> 00:04:37.950
<v Speaker 1>it's a science that's very likely to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>targeted by extremists.</v>

101
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.090
<v Speaker 1>You also brought up something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually touches on the site on the</v>

102
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.320
<v Speaker 1>difficult problem of how it is that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>might define someone who is</v>

103
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.240
<v Speaker 1>ideologically possessed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

104
00:04:48.241 --> 00:04:52.800
<v Speaker 1>or ideologically rigid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the idea was that you can make a</v>

105
00:04:52.801 --> 00:04:57.780
<v Speaker 1>valid case for the utility of free</v>
<v Speaker 1>information flow and the free flow of</v>

106
00:04:57.781 --> 00:05:00.720
<v Speaker 1>people that would go along with that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could make a good case for the</v>

107
00:05:00.721 --> 00:05:03.690
<v Speaker 1>danger of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea might be that if you're</v>

108
00:05:03.691 --> 00:05:06.000
<v Speaker 1>only making a case for the danger of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

109
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.890
<v Speaker 1>then you're tilted too far to the right.</v>

110
00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.500
<v Speaker 1>And if you're only making a case for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>utility of that,</v>

111
00:05:10.501 --> 00:05:12.490
<v Speaker 1>then you're tilted too far to the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

112
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.010
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we can look at immigration as a</v>

113
00:05:15.011 --> 00:05:16.810
<v Speaker 1>nice example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a recent essay in the</v>

114
00:05:16.811 --> 00:05:18.760
<v Speaker 1>Atlantic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was by Peter Beinart,</v>

115
00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.550
<v Speaker 1>where he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

116
00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.820
<v Speaker 1>he reviews.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had started with a lot of quotes that</v>

117
00:05:24.821 --> 00:05:28.150
<v Speaker 1>are pretty nuanced positions about</v>
<v Speaker 1>immigration from Barack Obama.</v>

118
00:05:28.151 --> 00:05:30.820
<v Speaker 1>Paul Krugman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of other people on the left who</v>

119
00:05:30.821 --> 00:05:32.770
<v Speaker 1>used to be able to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the one hand,</v>

120
00:05:32.771 --> 00:05:34.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compassion,</v>

121
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.620
<v Speaker 1>economic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand,</v>

122
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to have a legal process and</v>

123
00:05:38.441 --> 00:05:41.890
<v Speaker 1>there's a threat to low wage workers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so people on the left,</v>

124
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.070
<v Speaker 1>you still have to talk about immigration</v>
<v Speaker 1>and talk about the pros and cons,</v>

125
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.040
<v Speaker 1>pluses and minuses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but beinart shows how in the last four</v>

126
00:05:48.041 --> 00:05:53.041
<v Speaker 1>or five years you can't if you so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>as suggest that will maybe immigration</v>

127
00:05:53.261 --> 00:05:56.620
<v Speaker 1>is a net good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it might have some deleterious</v>

128
00:05:56.621 --> 00:05:59.900
<v Speaker 1>effects on certain classes of of low</v>
<v Speaker 1>wage American workers.</v>

129
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.150
<v Speaker 1>You could get in big trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

130
00:06:02.151 --> 00:06:06.410
<v Speaker 1>Because that's instantly prejudicial</v>
<v Speaker 1>because immigration has become a sacred</v>

131
00:06:06.411 --> 00:06:08.330
<v Speaker 1>topic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is the key thing that I want</v>

132
00:06:08.331 --> 00:06:12.290
<v Speaker 1>everyone to keep in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are fundamentally religious creatures</v>

133
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.610
<v Speaker 1>were built for religion and it's a great</v>
<v Speaker 1>achievement to create a scientific</v>

134
00:06:16.611 --> 00:06:19.910
<v Speaker 1>establishment and an academic</v>
<v Speaker 1>establishment that keeps that way of</v>

135
00:06:19.911 --> 00:06:22.730
<v Speaker 1>thinking out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scientific thinking is not natural</v>

136
00:06:22.731 --> 00:06:24.920
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Religious thinking is natural thinking</v>

137
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:29.660
<v Speaker 1>and what's happening to us in the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>few years especially is a flooding in of</v>

138
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.770
<v Speaker 1>religious thinking and so let's get a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of social scientists talk about</v>

139
00:06:33.771 --> 00:06:35.390
<v Speaker 1>immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are they going to do?</v>

140
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.920
<v Speaker 1>Look at the data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way up.</v>

141
00:06:36.921 --> 00:06:38.660
<v Speaker 1>The pluses and minuses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

142
00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.740
<v Speaker 1>they're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of them feel they're on a team and</v>

143
00:06:42.741 --> 00:06:45.640
<v Speaker 1>that team is fighting the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The right is anti-immigrant.</v>

144
00:06:45.641 --> 00:06:50.420
<v Speaker 1>It includes racist elements there for</v>
<v Speaker 1>that justifies us in being pro.</v>

145
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.420
<v Speaker 1>Immigration and social sciences are</v>
<v Speaker 1>always.</v>

146
00:06:53.421 --> 00:06:56.240
<v Speaker 1>There's always ambiguity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always conflicting stories,</v>

147
00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.810
<v Speaker 1>multiple causal factors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that always in the social science</v>

148
00:06:59.811 --> 00:07:00.770
<v Speaker 1>study?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

149
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:05.510
<v Speaker 1>So [inaudible] point was that the left</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to be able to think straight about</v>

150
00:07:05.511 --> 00:07:06.860
<v Speaker 1>immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clearly it had a,</v>

151
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:08.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was generally pro immigration,</v>

152
00:07:08.541 --> 00:07:09.890
<v Speaker 1>but it used to be able to think</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight,</v>

153
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:14.480
<v Speaker 1>but in the last few years a religious</v>
<v Speaker 1>orthodox mindset has overtaken it.</v>

154
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:16.400
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we might as well also pointed out</v>

155
00:07:16.401 --> 00:07:18.770
<v Speaker 1>that it's a primordial religious</v>
<v Speaker 1>mindset,</v>

156
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.950
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I mean there are definitely</v>

157
00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:24.110
<v Speaker 1>Christian or Jewish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean ancient tribal,</v>

158
00:07:24.111 --> 00:07:25.970
<v Speaker 1>small scale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of gods.</v>

159
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:26.601
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

160
00:07:26.601 --> 00:07:28.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then one of the things that you might</v>

161
00:07:28.311 --> 00:07:33.040
<v Speaker 1>suggest is that when you throw out a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated religious structure in</v>

162
00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:36.920
<v Speaker 1>unsophisticated religious structure</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes in to fill the gap.</v>

163
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:37.880
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's true.</v>

164
00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.120
<v Speaker 1>That's definitely worth thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's right.</v>

165
00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.610
<v Speaker 1>So that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing with religions,</v>

166
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:46.520
<v Speaker 1>we have to clarify,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentalism is the problem,</v>

167
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:49.550
<v Speaker 1>not religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you close tribalism,</v>

168
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:52.160
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get a fundamentalist,</v>

169
00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:53.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy to say,</v>

170
00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:57.230
<v Speaker 1>and if you have people applying to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grad program in psychology and I find</v>

171
00:07:57.231 --> 00:07:59.510
<v Speaker 1>out that they're Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

172
00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.600
<v Speaker 1>There's no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if they're fundamentalist Christian,</v>

173
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:04.550
<v Speaker 1>I would think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let's say let's say it's not</v>

174
00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:07.130
<v Speaker 1>psychologists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a geology.</v>

175
00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:09.500
<v Speaker 1>So somewhat applies to a geology</v>
<v Speaker 1>program.</v>

176
00:08:09.501 --> 00:08:11.360
<v Speaker 1>There are fundamentalists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young,</v>

177
00:08:11.361 --> 00:08:14.150
<v Speaker 1>earth creationist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you gonna admit them?</v>

178
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:15.920
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you should.</v>

179
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:20.950
<v Speaker 1>They're not able to do the right kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking based on what we know to be the</v>

180
00:08:21.381 --> 00:08:23.800
<v Speaker 1>case there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not in the scientific paradigm,</v>

181
00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:24.710
<v Speaker 1>not in the sand type.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

182
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:27.740
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if we wouldn't admit a fundamentalist</v>

183
00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:32.390
<v Speaker 1>Christian to a geology program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would we admit someone who is just</v>

184
00:08:32.391 --> 00:08:35.780
<v Speaker 1>as fundamentalist about certain moral</v>
<v Speaker 1>and political issues into a sociology</v>

185
00:08:35.781 --> 00:08:40.070
<v Speaker 1>program or into a psychology program if</v>
<v Speaker 1>they come in knowing what the right</v>

186
00:08:40.071 --> 00:08:42.230
<v Speaker 1>answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>committed to that right answer,</v>

187
00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:46.700
<v Speaker 1>likely to get angry at anyone who</v>
<v Speaker 1>contravenes that right answer.</v>

188
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:48.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

189
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:52.940
<v Speaker 1>and showing signs of close mindedness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they belong in the.</v>

190
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.330
<v Speaker 1>I guess the question is how in the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you set up mechanisms to ensure that</v>

191
00:08:57.331 --> 00:09:00.960
<v Speaker 1>you're not swamped by fundamentalists of</v>
<v Speaker 1>any sort?</v>

192
00:09:00.961 --> 00:09:03.870
<v Speaker 1>So those are people who are reducing</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything to a single cause.</v>

193
00:09:03.871 --> 00:09:07.290
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can you implement a structure that</v>

194
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:11.490
<v Speaker 1>protects the organization against that</v>
<v Speaker 1>without the structure itself becoming</v>

195
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:14.010
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because these things,</v>

196
00:09:14.011 --> 00:09:15.990
<v Speaker 1>these things spin out of control so</v>
<v Speaker 1>fast.</v>

197
00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:17.280
<v Speaker 1>But so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

198
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:21.210
<v Speaker 1>I think what we have to realize in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>academy is that we face,</v>

199
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.860
<v Speaker 1>I think we face an existential crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

200
00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:28.080
<v Speaker 1>we rely on an enormous amount of public</v>
<v Speaker 1>goodwill.</v>

201
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:33.230
<v Speaker 1>We get enormous tax subsidies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a direct research support and recent</v>

202
00:09:34.111 --> 00:09:38.010
<v Speaker 1>polling shows that while Democrats have</v>
<v Speaker 1>always had a higher opinion of the</v>

203
00:09:38.011 --> 00:09:40.380
<v Speaker 1>universities and Republicans until two</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

204
00:09:40.381 --> 00:09:42.540
<v Speaker 1>everybody thought universities are a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good thing.</v>

205
00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.420
<v Speaker 1>They make life better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Americans have been very supportive</v>

206
00:09:45.421 --> 00:09:47.760
<v Speaker 1>of higher education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There have been rising gripes on the</v>

207
00:09:47.761 --> 00:09:51.540
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's only between 2015 and 2017 that</v>

208
00:09:51.541 --> 00:09:55.710
<v Speaker 1>now republicans go from saying mostly</v>
<v Speaker 1>universities are good things in two</v>

209
00:09:55.711 --> 00:09:57.470
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go way down and say universities</v>

210
00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.190
<v Speaker 1>are bad things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're making things worse.</v>

211
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:01.380
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is this news greeted?</v>

212
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.740
<v Speaker 1>Pundits on the left are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

213
00:10:04.741 --> 00:10:08.820
<v Speaker 1>those republicans are so anti science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look how ignorant they are.</v>

214
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:12.240
<v Speaker 1>They now hate universities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

215
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:15.780
<v Speaker 1>Anybody who's been watching the news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody who's seen the mobs,</v>

216
00:10:15.781 --> 00:10:18.300
<v Speaker 1>the shout downs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the illiberal behavior,</v>

217
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the metaphor I use is like,</v>

218
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans on the right and left are</v>

219
00:10:22.261 --> 00:10:24.010
<v Speaker 1>really supportive of the military.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have.</v>

220
00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:26.970
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the few institutions that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>still hold in highest team on both</v>

221
00:10:26.971 --> 00:10:29.370
<v Speaker 1>sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the Republicans more than</v>

222
00:10:29.371 --> 00:10:29.970
<v Speaker 1>Democrats.</v>

223
00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:31.900
<v Speaker 1>So suppose you had Gallup poll and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

224
00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.530
<v Speaker 1>showing Republicans liked the military</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than Democrats,</v>

225
00:10:34.531 --> 00:10:39.420
<v Speaker 1>but both really liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then suddenly in 2015 we started seeing</v>

226
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:44.600
<v Speaker 1>video from all over military bases and</v>
<v Speaker 1>military academies in which the,</v>

227
00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:47.760
<v Speaker 1>the military leaders are overtly right</v>
<v Speaker 1>wing.</v>

228
00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.610
<v Speaker 1>They're there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're saying terrible things about</v>

229
00:10:50.611 --> 00:10:54.900
<v Speaker 1>leftists and progressives and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>midshipmen and the cadets and everybody</v>

230
00:10:54.901 --> 00:10:58.710
<v Speaker 1>is mobbing the occasional liberal and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>behaving in a really despicable,</v>

231
00:10:58.711 --> 00:11:02.430
<v Speaker 1>scary and intimidating way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think the left would now</v>

232
00:11:02.431 --> 00:11:05.130
<v Speaker 1>think about the military?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously support for the military would</v>

233
00:11:05.131 --> 00:11:08.370
<v Speaker 1>plummet and that's what's happening in</v>
<v Speaker 1>America with universities.</v>

234
00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:11.130
<v Speaker 1>We are losing the support of half the</v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

235
00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:14.550
<v Speaker 1>This is unsustainable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in red states where,</v>

236
00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:16.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they control the purse strings.</v>

237
00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:21.060
<v Speaker 1>So I think we have a major crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we've got to go into crisis mode</v>

238
00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:24.480
<v Speaker 1>and we've got to clean up our act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just as we're doing in psychology</v>

239
00:11:24.481 --> 00:11:28.050
<v Speaker 1>with replication project where we</v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize that our methods weren't good</v>

240
00:11:28.051 --> 00:11:32.160
<v Speaker 1>enough and we're doing a crash course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thanks to Brian Nosek and others,</v>

241
00:11:32.161 --> 00:11:35.130
<v Speaker 1>the open science project,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're really trying to improve our game.</v>

242
00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:38.100
<v Speaker 1>Thank God we need to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we have to do the exact same</v>

243
00:11:38.101 --> 00:11:41.460
<v Speaker 1>thing about partisanship and our on our</v>
<v Speaker 1>duty.</v>
