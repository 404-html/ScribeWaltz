1
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.760
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jacob and Esau are,</v>

2
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.490
<v Speaker 1>are hostile brothers there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like Cain and Abel except the</v>

3
00:00:15.491 --> 00:00:17.310
<v Speaker 1>mixture of Cain and Abel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're very different.</v>

4
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.720
<v Speaker 1>Esau was red and covered with hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a hunter and a man of the field.</v>

5
00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:23.550
<v Speaker 1>So he's like your basic joc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

6
00:00:23.551 --> 00:00:25.020
<v Speaker 1>He's extroverted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's outgoing,</v>

7
00:00:25.021 --> 00:00:28.380
<v Speaker 1>he's really tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's extraordinarily masculine,</v>

8
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.230
<v Speaker 1>he hunts and he's a real favorite of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>

9
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.610
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

10
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.150
<v Speaker 1>and Jacob isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a dweller intense and um,</v>

11
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:37.951
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

12
00:00:37.951 --> 00:00:39.630
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

13
00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:42.870
<v Speaker 1>Exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it says Isaac loved Esau,</v>

14
00:00:42.871 --> 00:00:45.540
<v Speaker 1>but Rebecca loved Jacob.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a problem,</v>

15
00:00:45.541 --> 00:00:46.950
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That that's a big problem.</v>

16
00:00:46.951 --> 00:00:48.660
<v Speaker 1>And that there's a Friday in element to</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

17
00:00:48.661 --> 00:00:52.770
<v Speaker 1>It's like this family is now divided</v>
<v Speaker 1>because one child is the favorite of the</v>

18
00:00:52.771 --> 00:00:56.250
<v Speaker 1>mother and that's Jacob.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one child is the favorite of the</v>

19
00:00:56.251 --> 00:00:59.370
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so Jacob is kind of a mother's boy,</v>

20
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.460
<v Speaker 1>I guess to use an arc or rather archaic</v>
<v Speaker 1>phrase and certainly not as admirable</v>

21
00:01:05.341 --> 00:01:09.390
<v Speaker 1>from his father's perspective as Esau,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who a tough guy who goes out with a bow</v>

22
00:01:09.391 --> 00:01:10.710
<v Speaker 1>and Arrow and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:01:10.711 --> 00:01:13.180
<v Speaker 1>wanders around in the plains and brings</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals home.</v>

24
00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.880
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's tough.</v>

25
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.190
<v Speaker 1>He's a tough guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

26
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.390
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

27
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.130
<v Speaker 1>but there's this discord in the family</v>
<v Speaker 1>because one parent prefers one child and</v>

28
00:01:23.131 --> 00:01:26.760
<v Speaker 1>the other parent prefers the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's obvious from the story that the</v>

29
00:01:26.761 --> 00:01:30.210
<v Speaker 1>parents do not communicate about this</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they really take sides.</v>

30
00:01:30.211 --> 00:01:34.680
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a split in the family and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's I think very realistic because</v>

31
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.350
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that you do learn if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a family,</v>

32
00:01:37.351 --> 00:01:40.290
<v Speaker 1>and of course most of you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you also think about families is</v>

33
00:01:40.291 --> 00:01:43.890
<v Speaker 1>that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's deep divisions within families</v>

34
00:01:43.891 --> 00:01:46.050
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very frequently that no one will ever</v>

35
00:01:46.051 --> 00:01:49.920
<v Speaker 1>talk about and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even think about often because it's</v>

36
00:01:49.921 --> 00:01:51.640
<v Speaker 1>too painful to think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

37
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.980
<v Speaker 1>Freud himself said Freud was clearly his</v>
<v Speaker 1>mother's favorite and the family</v>

38
00:01:55.981 --> 00:01:59.040
<v Speaker 1>sacrificed a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including some of the potential</v>

39
00:01:59.041 --> 00:02:02.640
<v Speaker 1>ambitions of the other children in order</v>
<v Speaker 1>to kind of put Sigmund Freud up on a</v>

40
00:02:02.641 --> 00:02:05.010
<v Speaker 1>pedestal and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and advanced is education.</v>

41
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.030
<v Speaker 1>And it worked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

42
00:02:06.031 --> 00:02:06.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

43
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.070
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he turned into a great man,</v>

44
00:02:08.071 --> 00:02:11.700
<v Speaker 1>but there was a cost to his siblings and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud himself said that there was</v>

45
00:02:11.701 --> 00:02:16.701
<v Speaker 1>something about being the favorite of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mother that gave a person additional</v>

46
00:02:17.731 --> 00:02:20.490
<v Speaker 1>confidence throughout their life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

47
00:02:20.491 --> 00:02:22.650
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something to be said about that</v>

48
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.480
<v Speaker 1>is when someone like Eric Erikson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:02:24.481 --> 00:02:27.150
<v Speaker 1>he noted that very interested in child</v>
<v Speaker 1>development,</v>

50
00:02:27.151 --> 00:02:29.880
<v Speaker 1>that that first bonding with the mother</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the,</v>

51
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.310
<v Speaker 1>was it the place where trust was</v>
<v Speaker 1>established,</v>

52
00:02:32.311 --> 00:02:35.550
<v Speaker 1>maybe trust even in the goodness of</v>
<v Speaker 1>existence was established.</v>

53
00:02:35.551 --> 00:02:39.920
<v Speaker 1>And so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jacob is Rachel's favorite and uh,</v>

54
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.740
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

55
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.090
<v Speaker 1>Esau is Isaac's favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

56
00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.280
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

57
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.280
<v Speaker 1>Now eso being extroverted let's say is</v>
<v Speaker 1>also a bit impulsive and maybe he's not,</v>

58
00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.580
<v Speaker 1>he's a man of action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not a forward thinker,</v>

59
00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.260
<v Speaker 1>but he's also doing hard work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

60
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes out and he's hunting and he's</v>

61
00:03:01.091 --> 00:03:04.330
<v Speaker 1>worn out and he comes home and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>faint with hunger.</v>

62
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.630
<v Speaker 1>And</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jacob is at home,</v>

63
00:03:07.631 --> 00:03:09.430
<v Speaker 1>cooking is boiling up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lentils,</v>

64
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.540
<v Speaker 1>red lentils,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

65
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.920
<v Speaker 1>Esau comes in from the haunt and eats</v>
<v Speaker 1>like half starved to death.</v>

66
00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:19.921
<v Speaker 1>And he's sitting there and the aroma of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these red lentils reaches them and he's</v>

67
00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:22.060
<v Speaker 1>exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

68
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.980
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he tells Jacob that he wants some of</v>

69
00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:31.960
<v Speaker 1>this stew and Jacob who's being a pain</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the neck,</v>

70
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.720
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have basically says,</v>

71
00:03:34.721 --> 00:03:35.441
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

72
00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:38.290
<v Speaker 1>there's a teasing thing going on here</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

73
00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.650
<v Speaker 1>and won't give him any.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

74
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.140
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's,</v>

75
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.620
<v Speaker 1>you have to imagine this because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not laid out explicitly in the story,</v>

76
00:03:44.621 --> 00:03:49.621
<v Speaker 1>but there's some dispute about whether</v>
<v Speaker 1>Esau gets to have lunch.</v>

77
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.490
<v Speaker 1>And Jacob finally says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

78
00:03:51.491 --> 00:03:53.860
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to s you have to give me</v>

79
00:03:53.861 --> 00:03:57.060
<v Speaker 1>your birthright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you saw,</v>

80
00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.200
<v Speaker 1>you think he might say something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

81
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.090
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to hell with it,</v>

82
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.290
<v Speaker 1>take it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

83
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.270
<v Speaker 1>you son of a bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take it.</v>

84
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.330
<v Speaker 1>Just give me some damn stew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

85
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.250
<v Speaker 1>So that's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

86
00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:11.980
<v Speaker 1>with these archaic people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once he made a statement like that,</v>

87
00:04:11.981 --> 00:04:12.880
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were done.</v>

88
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.890
<v Speaker 1>That was it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

89
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.000
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>east south sells his birthright and this</v>

90
00:04:19.001 --> 00:04:24.001
<v Speaker 1>turns out to be incredibly significant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Benson who wrote Biblical commentary</v>

91
00:04:24.971 --> 00:04:26.140
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

92
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.120
<v Speaker 1>there's a bit of a twist to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Esau eats the,</v>

93
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.680
<v Speaker 1>the red lentils and then from then on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his name is red.</v>

94
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.440
<v Speaker 1>And you've got to use your imagination a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

95
00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:37.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are making fun of him,</v>

96
00:04:37.751 --> 00:04:38.020
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

97
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.550
<v Speaker 1>That's why they're calling them red.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

98
00:04:39.551 --> 00:04:41.920
<v Speaker 1>he's already read because we established</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

99
00:04:41.921 --> 00:04:43.720
<v Speaker 1>but no one was calling him read before</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

100
00:04:43.721 --> 00:04:46.510
<v Speaker 1>And so for the rest of his life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

101
00:04:46.511 --> 00:04:49.030
<v Speaker 1>every time he goes out amongst his</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends and family,</v>

102
00:04:49.031 --> 00:04:51.520
<v Speaker 1>they call them red and sort of snicker</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's the,</v>

103
00:04:51.521 --> 00:04:53.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half famished idiot who sold his</v>

104
00:04:53.771 --> 00:04:56.470
<v Speaker 1>birthright for a bowl of lentils.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's,</v>

105
00:04:56.471 --> 00:04:59.410
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that funny actually.</v>

106
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.140
<v Speaker 1>And so Esau is not happy about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

107
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.600
<v Speaker 1>and it actually turns out that this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what does it mean?</v>

108
00:05:04.601 --> 00:05:08.350
<v Speaker 1>It means don't sell the future for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>desires of the present and don't be</v>

109
00:05:08.351 --> 00:05:11.620
<v Speaker 1>casual about what you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's an archetype element to</v>

110
00:05:11.621 --> 00:05:13.330
<v Speaker 1>this too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Benson says,</v>

111
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.970
<v Speaker 1>various have been the opinions what this</v>
<v Speaker 1>birthright was,</v>

112
00:05:15.971 --> 00:05:19.840
<v Speaker 1>which Esau sold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the most probable is that together</v>

113
00:05:19.841 --> 00:05:23.560
<v Speaker 1>with the right of sacrificing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so determining what should be sacrificed</v>

114
00:05:23.561 --> 00:05:26.080
<v Speaker 1>and win and being the priest of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>

115
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.220
<v Speaker 1>it included the peculiar blessing</v>
<v Speaker 1>promised to the seed of Abraham,</v>

116
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.570
<v Speaker 1>that of being the progenitor of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Messiah and the error of the special</v>

117
00:05:34.571 --> 00:05:37.210
<v Speaker 1>promises of God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>respecting Christ's kingdom.</v>

118
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.330
<v Speaker 1>It was at least typical of spiritual</v>
<v Speaker 1>privileges.</v>

119
00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.240
<v Speaker 1>Those of the firstborn that are written</v>
<v Speaker 1>in heaven.</v>

120
00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot harsher than meets the eye</v>

121
00:05:50.261 --> 00:05:54.730
<v Speaker 1>to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a very interesting deep</v>

122
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.200
<v Speaker 1>moral story there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

123
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.970
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of Esau does the opposite of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice.</v>

124
00:06:01.971 --> 00:06:03.140
<v Speaker 1>It's the reverse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

125
00:06:03.141 --> 00:06:05.330
<v Speaker 1>He sacrifices the future for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>present.</v>

126
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.060
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

127
00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.640
<v Speaker 1>the story basically says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way it's laid out across stories is</v>

128
00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:15.641
<v Speaker 1>that if you're the sort of person that</v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifices the future to the present,</v>

129
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:21.040
<v Speaker 1>then that eradicates the possibility</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you will bring the most noble being</v>

130
00:06:22.461 --> 00:06:24.590
<v Speaker 1>into existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it means.</v>

131
00:06:24.591 --> 00:06:26.000
<v Speaker 1>And you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

132
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.370
<v Speaker 1>this is the psychological significance</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the biblical story.</v>

133
00:06:29.371 --> 00:06:34.070
<v Speaker 1>So that's a bad thing to do if you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to realize your potential.</v>

134
00:06:34.071 --> 00:06:36.860
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you don't do reverse</v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifices.</v>

135
00:06:36.861 --> 00:06:38.120
<v Speaker 1>That's a very bad idea.</v>

136
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:42.620
<v Speaker 1>And so east,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so really did himself in by being too</v>

137
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.310
<v Speaker 1>attached to the present without a vision</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the future.</v>

138
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:48.020
<v Speaker 1>So he's too in the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

139
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.080
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he pays a heavy price for it.</v>

140
00:06:51.081 --> 00:06:51.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the,</v>

141
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:55.190
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he loses his birthright and has double</v>

142
00:06:55.191 --> 00:06:57.210
<v Speaker 1>inheritance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a practical consequence.</v>

143
00:06:57.211 --> 00:06:58.700
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a spiritual</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence.</v>

144
00:06:58.701 --> 00:07:02.330
<v Speaker 1>And then he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while he's being made a fool of by his</v>

145
00:07:02.331 --> 00:07:05.930
<v Speaker 1>brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jacob means supplanter by the way,</v>

146
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:09.650
<v Speaker 1>that's what the name means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Jacob has always trying to usurp</v>

147
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.030
<v Speaker 1>Esau as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we see.</v>

148
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.640
<v Speaker 1>And so Jacob gets one over on him and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

149
00:07:13.641 --> 00:07:16.010
<v Speaker 1>that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't make an older brother happy when</v>

150
00:07:16.011 --> 00:07:17.630
<v Speaker 1>a younger brother gets something over on</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

151
00:07:17.631 --> 00:07:20.420
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he loses the opportunity to be</v>

152
00:07:20.421 --> 00:07:22.550
<v Speaker 1>the progenitor of the Messiah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like,</v>

153
00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.710
<v Speaker 1>he probably didn't realize that</v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely,</v>

154
00:07:24.711 --> 00:07:25.850
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

155
00:07:25.851 --> 00:07:27.260
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of rough that so.</v>
