00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.870
<v Speaker 1>Even if there's a minority of good in a place that isn't good,</v>

2
00:00:03.871 --> 00:00:05.610
<v Speaker 1>it won't be slated for destruction.</v>

3
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.290
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of a good thing.</v>

4
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.950
<v Speaker 1>And the third is a minority of good in a place can keep it from being destroyed.</v>

5
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.050
<v Speaker 1>And that's a really good thing too.</v>

6
00:00:16.051 --> 00:00:17.670
<v Speaker 1>And I believe that as well.</v>

7
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.660
<v Speaker 1>I think that good is more powerful than evil.</v>

8
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.010
<v Speaker 1>Naivety isn't.</v>

9
00:00:23.011 --> 00:00:24.390
<v Speaker 1>But I think that good is,</v>

10
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.690
<v Speaker 1>and I think that in a place that's corrupt,</v>

11
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.280
<v Speaker 1>a minority of people who stand forth against the corruption can prevail.</v>

12
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.463
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

13
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:39.941
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:00:39.941 --> 00:00:40.321
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

15
00:00:40.321 --> 00:00:42.700
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the best examples of that again,</v>

16
00:00:42.701 --> 00:00:47.560
<v Speaker 1>was all Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn because he was in the terrible work camps when he</v>

17
00:00:47.561 --> 00:00:48.191
<v Speaker 1>wrote his book.</v>

18
00:00:48.191 --> 00:00:49.480
<v Speaker 1>He memorized most of it,</v>

19
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.350
<v Speaker 1>which is not an easy thing to do when it's 2100 pages long and set in very tiny</v>

20
00:00:53.351 --> 00:00:54.184
<v Speaker 1>font.</v>

21
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.510
<v Speaker 1>And he memorized most of it.</v>

22
00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.050
<v Speaker 1>And then he wrote it and it was one of the things that brought down the Soviet</v>

23
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.950
<v Speaker 1>Union.</v>

24
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:02.170
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

25
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.400
<v Speaker 1>it was published in the 1970s first of all in Wa in the West.</v>

26
00:01:06.401 --> 00:01:08.650
<v Speaker 1>And the first thing that happened,</v>

27
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.230
<v Speaker 1>at least initially was that</v>

28
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.093
<v Speaker 2>the</v>

29
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.630
<v Speaker 1>communism as an ethical system lost absolutely all credibility whatsoever among</v>

30
00:01:18.631 --> 00:01:20.520
<v Speaker 1>anyone who is even vaguely educated.</v>

31
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.490
<v Speaker 1>Immediately upon the publication of the Gulag archipelago,</v>

32
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.400
<v Speaker 1>he pulled the moral slots out from underneath it.</v>

33
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.520
<v Speaker 1>And the book was definitely one of the reasons there were many,</v>

34
00:01:29.521 --> 00:01:34.440
<v Speaker 1>but was definitely one of the reasons why the rotten system crumbled and fell</v>

35
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.520
<v Speaker 1>without a war.</v>

36
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.880
<v Speaker 1>And that's a great example of how one person can take on a tyranny and prevail.</v>

37
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.103
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

38
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.540
<v Speaker 1>and he's not the only person who did that sort of thing.</v>

39
00:01:45.541 --> 00:01:47.010
<v Speaker 1>Cause what Gandhi did the same thing.</v>

40
00:01:47.011 --> 00:01:47.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

41
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the English were the Russians,</v>

42
00:01:50.071 --> 00:01:50.910
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

43
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.710
<v Speaker 1>things were not so good in India.</v>

44
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.390
<v Speaker 1>And what Gandhi did in India under the influence by the way of Leo Tolstoy,</v>

45
00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.793
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

46
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.410
<v Speaker 1>was also a remarkable example of a single person intervening in a catastrophe</v>

47
00:02:05.411 --> 00:02:06.130
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

48
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.670
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

49
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.010
<v Speaker 1>and setting it far more right than it could be.</v>
