1
00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.690
<v Speaker 1>So here's,</v>

2
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:09.880
<v Speaker 1>here's part of the issue.</v>

3
00:00:09.881 --> 00:00:11.800
<v Speaker 1>So let's say that you're,</v>

4
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:13.180
<v Speaker 1>you have a computer.</v>

5
00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:14.763
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.630
<v Speaker 1>I have a story for this.</v>

7
00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:17.523
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

8
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:18.783
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

9
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.010
<v Speaker 1>one time when I was in Montreal,</v>

10
00:00:21.011 --> 00:00:22.330
<v Speaker 1>I was using my computer,</v>

11
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.790
<v Speaker 1>it's in my apartment and I was typing out an essay and it crashed.</v>

12
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.710
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens when your computer crashes?</v>

13
00:00:32.711 --> 00:00:32.981
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

14
00:00:32.981 --> 00:00:33.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:00:33.251 --> 00:00:35.500
<v Speaker 1>usually you add here some sort of curse.</v>

16
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.840
<v Speaker 1>And it's interesting that you do that because the circuit that you use to curse</v>

17
00:00:40.841 --> 00:00:45.841
<v Speaker 1>with is the same circuit that monkeys used to detect eagles or leopards or</v>

18
00:00:46.091 --> 00:00:46.924
<v Speaker 1>snakes.</v>

19
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.400
<v Speaker 1>And so when,</v>

20
00:00:48.401 --> 00:00:50.050
<v Speaker 1>when there's a bunch of monkeys together,</v>

21
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.591
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:00:50.591 --> 00:00:52.990
<v Speaker 1>they're not all preyed on by eagles and leopards and snakes,</v>

23
00:00:52.991 --> 00:00:53.950
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

24
00:00:53.951 --> 00:00:56.950
<v Speaker 1>there's usually you have Predator in that category for every single monkey</v>

25
00:00:56.951 --> 00:00:57.641
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>

26
00:00:57.641 --> 00:00:59.230
<v Speaker 1>And so when the monkeys are watching,</v>

27
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:00.240
<v Speaker 1>they have an,</v>

28
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.020
<v Speaker 1>an emotional adherents that the most nervous monkey might utter first that</v>

29
00:01:05.021 --> 00:01:05.950
<v Speaker 1>basically says,</v>

30
00:01:05.951 --> 00:01:06.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

31
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:07.750
<v Speaker 1>hide from the Eagle,</v>

32
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.560
<v Speaker 1>get out on the thin branch so the cougar can't eat you and look the hell out for</v>

33
00:01:11.561 --> 00:01:12.394
<v Speaker 1>the snake.</v>

34
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.780
<v Speaker 1>But there's a circuit that's linked to emotions that produces that instinct,</v>

35
00:01:16.781 --> 00:01:19.150
<v Speaker 1>instinctive audience that represents that category.</v>

36
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.050
<v Speaker 1>And that's the same circuit that you use when you curse.</v>

37
00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.620
<v Speaker 1>And it's not the same circuit that used for normal language.</v>

38
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.890
<v Speaker 1>And we know that because that circuit is activated and people who have</v>

39
00:01:29.891 --> 00:01:33.190
<v Speaker 1>Tourette's syndrome because they preferentially swear,</v>

40
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.791
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

41
00:01:33.791 --> 00:01:34.211
<v Speaker 1>well how,</v>

42
00:01:34.211 --> 00:01:37.060
<v Speaker 1>why in the world would you have a neurological condition that makes you</v>

43
00:01:37.061 --> 00:01:38.350
<v Speaker 1>preferentially curse?</v>

44
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.620
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the reason why you don't just have one linguistic circuit.</v>

45
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.120
<v Speaker 1>You have one for,</v>

46
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.961
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

47
00:01:43.961 --> 00:01:48.961
<v Speaker 1>there's a Predator and that's the one that will get activated when something</v>

48
00:01:49.481 --> 00:01:49.871
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

49
00:01:49.871 --> 00:01:53.530
<v Speaker 1>Like your computer crashing because you know you're an evolved creature.</v>

50
00:01:53.531 --> 00:01:58.531
<v Speaker 1>And so those old circuits that were there say 30 million years ago to deal with</v>

51
00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.830
<v Speaker 1>exceptions are the same circuits you're using now to deal with your computer.</v>

52
00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.390
<v Speaker 1>Why else would you want to hit it?</v>

53
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.411
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

54
00:02:05.411 --> 00:02:07.180
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's what you want to give it a whack.</v>

55
00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.870
<v Speaker 1>It's like it doesn't behave whack aggression right away.</v>

56
00:02:10.871 --> 00:02:13.170
<v Speaker 1>Well that's some clue as to the categorize,</v>

57
00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.480
<v Speaker 1>categorize category system that you're automatically using to encapsulate the</v>

58
00:02:18.581 --> 00:02:19.414
<v Speaker 1>event.</v>

59
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.501
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

60
00:02:20.501 --> 00:02:21.340
<v Speaker 1>so fine.</v>

61
00:02:21.341 --> 00:02:22.880
<v Speaker 1>What do you do when your computer crashes?</v>

62
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:23.081
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

63
00:02:23.081 --> 00:02:26.380
<v Speaker 1>first you curse and then you do the stupid things that idiot primates do when</v>

64
00:02:26.381 --> 00:02:30.070
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to deal with something that's way too complex and maybe you turn</v>

65
00:02:30.071 --> 00:02:31.030
<v Speaker 1>it on and off,</v>

66
00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.750
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

67
00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:32.650
<v Speaker 1>And that doesn't work.</v>

68
00:02:32.651 --> 00:02:33.221
<v Speaker 1>It didn't work.</v>

69
00:02:33.221 --> 00:02:34.001
<v Speaker 1>And so then I thought,</v>

70
00:02:34.001 --> 00:02:34.211
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

71
00:02:34.211 --> 00:02:35.260
<v Speaker 1>maybe the powerbar went.</v>

72
00:02:35.261 --> 00:02:37.390
<v Speaker 1>So I checked the power bar and it,</v>

73
00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.560
<v Speaker 1>I turned it on and off and nothing happened.</v>

74
00:02:39.561 --> 00:02:41.320
<v Speaker 1>And so I brought a light behind the computer.</v>

75
00:02:41.321 --> 00:02:42.230
<v Speaker 1>The light wouldn't go on.</v>

76
00:02:42.231 --> 00:02:42.791
<v Speaker 1>And so I thought,</v>

77
00:02:42.791 --> 00:02:43.624
<v Speaker 1>Aha,</v>

78
00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.190
<v Speaker 1>I must have blown a fuse.</v>

79
00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.190
<v Speaker 1>So I went to the fuse box and took a,</v>

80
00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.011
<v Speaker 1>took a look,</v>

81
00:02:48.011 --> 00:02:49.360
<v Speaker 1>but the fuses were fine.</v>

82
00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.493
<v Speaker 1>And so I thought,</v>

83
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:51.011
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

84
00:02:51.011 --> 00:02:51.940
<v Speaker 1>the power's gone out.</v>

85
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.400
<v Speaker 1>So then I went outside and the power was out.</v>

86
00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.770
<v Speaker 1>None of the street lights were working,</v>

87
00:02:56.771 --> 00:02:58.120
<v Speaker 1>the power was out everywhere.</v>

88
00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.230
<v Speaker 1>And it was seriously,</v>

89
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.500
<v Speaker 1>because this was the time that the almost the entire northeast power grid in,</v>

90
00:03:04.501 --> 00:03:06.880
<v Speaker 1>in Quebec collapsed.</v>

91
00:03:06.881 --> 00:03:10.420
<v Speaker 1>And the reason it collapsed is because there was a solar flare that happens</v>

92
00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.410
<v Speaker 1>reasonably often.</v>

93
00:03:11.411 --> 00:03:15.850
<v Speaker 1>And the solar flare produced a huge electromagnetic pulse because it's basically</v>

94
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.290
<v Speaker 1>like a billion high million hydrogen bombs going off at the same time.</v>

95
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.240
<v Speaker 1>93 million miles away,</v>

96
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.360
<v Speaker 1>produces this tremendous electromagnetic pulse,</v>

97
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.490
<v Speaker 1>passes through the Earth's atmosphere,</v>

98
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.070
<v Speaker 1>produces a spike and current in the main power lines and blows the whole system.</v>

99
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.020
<v Speaker 1>And so just so you know,</v>

100
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.970
<v Speaker 1>assist,</v>

101
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:36.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

102
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.020
<v Speaker 1>an event like that happens about every hundred and 50 years.</v>

103
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.310
<v Speaker 1>And if we had one now,</v>

104
00:03:42.311 --> 00:03:44.080
<v Speaker 1>it would take out all of our electronics.</v>

105
00:03:44.081 --> 00:03:44.950
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the big ones.</v>

106
00:03:44.951 --> 00:03:46.750
<v Speaker 1>There was a big one back in the late 18 hundreds.</v>

107
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:47.351
<v Speaker 1>Everything,</v>

108
00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:47.951
<v Speaker 1>satellites,</v>

109
00:03:47.951 --> 00:03:48.521
<v Speaker 1>computers,</v>

110
00:03:48.521 --> 00:03:49.270
<v Speaker 1>cars,</v>

111
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.710
<v Speaker 1>everything gone.</v>

112
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.160
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a big problem and no one knows what to do about it.</v>

113
00:03:54.161 --> 00:03:56.140
<v Speaker 1>One missed us by about nine minutes,</v>

114
00:03:56.141 --> 00:03:56.501
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

115
00:03:56.501 --> 00:03:57.340
<v Speaker 1>two years ago.</v>

116
00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:58.573
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

117
00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.420
<v Speaker 1>so that's something else to worry about if you're inclined to worry about those</v>

118
00:04:01.421 --> 00:04:02.254
<v Speaker 1>sorts of things.</v>

119
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.453
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

120
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:04.211
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

121
00:04:04.211 --> 00:04:04.611
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>

122
00:04:04.611 --> 00:04:05.920
<v Speaker 1>what did I conclude from that?</v>

123
00:04:05.921 --> 00:04:06.754
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

124
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.700
<v Speaker 1>the function of my computer was dependent on the stability of the sun.</v>

125
00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.180
<v Speaker 1>It's not the first thing you check out when your computer crashes,</v>

126
00:04:16.181 --> 00:04:16.361
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

127
00:04:16.361 --> 00:04:17.021
<v Speaker 1>You don't run out and go,</v>

128
00:04:17.021 --> 00:04:17.560
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

129
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.041
<v Speaker 1>well yeah,</v>

130
00:04:18.041 --> 00:04:20.320
<v Speaker 1>the sun's still son's still there.</v>

131
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.211
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>

132
00:04:21.211 --> 00:04:21.391
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

133
00:04:21.391 --> 00:04:22.780
<v Speaker 1>can cross that off the list.</v>

134
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.530
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

135
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:24.280
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>

136
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.610
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

137
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:25.443
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

138
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.040
<v Speaker 1>it's an extraordinarily interesting example of the invisible interdependence of</v>

139
00:04:30.041 --> 00:04:30.550
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

140
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

141
00:04:30.821 --> 00:04:32.560
<v Speaker 1>and our tendency to fragment,</v>

142
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.330
<v Speaker 1>what we seem to do is to look at things at the simplest level of analysis that</v>

143
00:04:37.331 --> 00:04:38.620
<v Speaker 1>actually functions.</v>

144
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.120
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

145
00:04:40.121 --> 00:04:41.800
<v Speaker 1>when you're interacting with your computer,</v>

146
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.980
<v Speaker 1>you're not interacting with your computer at all really.</v>

147
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.630
<v Speaker 1>You're interacting with the keyboard sort of one key at a time and you're</v>

148
00:04:49.631 --> 00:04:52.180
<v Speaker 1>interacting with the symbols on the screen.</v>

149
00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.060
<v Speaker 1>But as long as the computer is working,</v>

150
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.040
<v Speaker 1>you don't care about it at all.</v>

151
00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.321
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

152
00:04:57.321 --> 00:05:01.600
<v Speaker 1>give it a second thought and you certainly don't care about the fact that it's</v>

153
00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:02.590
<v Speaker 1>dependent on,</v>

154
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.570
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

155
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.110
<v Speaker 1>the electrical power for example,</v>

156
00:05:05.111 --> 00:05:07.000
<v Speaker 1>and the electrical power is dependent on,</v>

157
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:09.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

158
00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many men are out there right now,</v>

159
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.380
<v Speaker 1>or we're out there last night when it was freezing rain,</v>

160
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.730
<v Speaker 1>fixing power lines and freezing to death while they're doing it so that your</v>

161
00:05:18.731 --> 00:05:21.370
<v Speaker 1>stupid computer doesn't malfunction while you're watching.</v>

162
00:05:21.371 --> 00:05:22.240
<v Speaker 1>Cat Videos,</v>

163
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.631
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

164
00:05:22.631 --> 00:05:27.631
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's this incredibly dynamic living system that social and economic</v>

165
00:05:28.451 --> 00:05:33.430
<v Speaker 1>and political that has to remain dead stable in order for us to have access to</v>

166
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:38.670
<v Speaker 1>functional and like pure non fluctuating electricity 100% of the time.</v>

167
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.650
<v Speaker 1>Cause you also don't think,</v>

168
00:05:41.651 --> 00:05:44.710
<v Speaker 1>well the stability of your computer is dependent on the stability of the</v>

169
00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:45.491
<v Speaker 1>political system.</v>

170
00:05:45.491 --> 00:05:49.450
<v Speaker 1>But of course it is because if the political system mucks up in the economic</v>

171
00:05:49.451 --> 00:05:50.171
<v Speaker 1>system goes,</v>

172
00:05:50.171 --> 00:05:54.550
<v Speaker 1>then people don't go out and work to fix things and things are breaking all the</v>

173
00:05:54.551 --> 00:05:55.384
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

174
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.590
<v Speaker 1>That's their normal state is broken,</v>

175
00:05:57.591 --> 00:05:57.891
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

176
00:05:57.891 --> 00:05:58.724
<v Speaker 1>not working.</v>

177
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.013
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

178
00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:05.640
<v Speaker 1>and that's all in some sense folded up not only inside your computer but</v>

179
00:06:06.261 --> 00:06:08.630
<v Speaker 1>actually inside your conceptions of,</v>

180
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.860
<v Speaker 1>of the your tiny conceptions of the computer while you're using it and you only</v>

181
00:06:12.861 --> 00:06:15.320
<v Speaker 1>get a glimpse of what the computer is really like.</v>

182
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:16.400
<v Speaker 1>When it doesn't work,</v>

183
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.580
<v Speaker 1>then it's when it becomes a complex object,</v>

184
00:06:19.581 --> 00:06:19.761
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

185
00:06:19.761 --> 00:06:20.930
<v Speaker 1>As long as it's working,</v>

186
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.180
<v Speaker 1>then you're stupid.</v>

187
00:06:23.181 --> 00:06:24.010
<v Speaker 1>Perceptions are,</v>

188
00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:27.800
<v Speaker 1>are perfectly fine to get the job done.</v>

189
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.510
<v Speaker 1>And that's another indication that what you're using your perceptions for is to</v>

190
00:06:32.511 --> 00:06:37.511
<v Speaker 1>get the job done and how you specify exactly the level of resolution that you</v>

191
00:06:38.181 --> 00:06:39.230
<v Speaker 1>should be operating at.</v>

192
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.810
<v Speaker 1>I haven't sorted that out,</v>

193
00:06:41.811 --> 00:06:45.350
<v Speaker 1>but it's something like you default to the simplest level that moves you to the</v>

194
00:06:45.351 --> 00:06:46.184
<v Speaker 1>next step,</v>

195
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:46.881
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

196
00:06:46.881 --> 00:06:47.691
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

197
00:06:47.691 --> 00:06:49.430
<v Speaker 1>and generally that is what you should do with,</v>

198
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:52.670
<v Speaker 1>if you're having an argument with someone that you have a longterm relationship</v>

199
00:06:52.671 --> 00:06:53.504
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

200
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.380
<v Speaker 1>you can start by arguing about what the little argument is about or you can</v>

201
00:06:57.381 --> 00:07:01.370
<v Speaker 1>immediately cascade into whether or not you should have a relationship with this</v>

202
00:07:01.371 --> 00:07:05.720
<v Speaker 1>person at all or even into whether or not you should even bother with</v>

203
00:07:05.721 --> 00:07:06.800
<v Speaker 1>relationships,</v>

204
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:08.143
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

205
00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:08.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

206
00:07:08.691 --> 00:07:10.040
<v Speaker 1>every time there's an argument,</v>

207
00:07:10.041 --> 00:07:14.030
<v Speaker 1>that question is a reasonable question to have emerged.</v>

208
00:07:14.031 --> 00:07:16.760
<v Speaker 1>Or at least it's in the realm of potential reasonable questions.</v>

209
00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:22.030
<v Speaker 1>But it doesn't seem useful to jump to the most catastrophic possible explanation</v>

210
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.710
<v Speaker 1>every time some minor thing goes wrong.</v>

211
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.260
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens to people that have an anxiety disorder.</v>

212
00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:29.780
<v Speaker 1>And that's what happens to people who are depressed,</v>

213
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:30.081
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

214
00:07:30.081 --> 00:07:32.120
<v Speaker 1>They can't bind the anomaly.</v>

215
00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:36.590
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens is it tends to propagate up the entire system until it takes</v>

216
00:07:36.591 --> 00:07:38.780
<v Speaker 1>out their highest order conceptualizations.</v>

217
00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:39.411
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

218
00:07:39.411 --> 00:07:41.210
<v Speaker 1>So if you're seriously depressed,</v>

219
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:44.180
<v Speaker 1>maybe you'll watch a news article about something stupid and you'll think,</v>

220
00:07:44.181 --> 00:07:44.541
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

221
00:07:44.541 --> 00:07:45.800
<v Speaker 1>why should I even be alive?</v>

222
00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:46.451
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

223
00:07:46.451 --> 00:07:46.691
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

224
00:07:46.691 --> 00:07:47.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm dead serious about that.</v>

225
00:07:47.991 --> 00:07:51.140
<v Speaker 1>If you score like 60 on the beck depression inventory,</v>

226
00:07:51.141 --> 00:07:53.150
<v Speaker 1>which puts you way the hell up and the depressed rage,</v>

227
00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:58.220
<v Speaker 1>anything that happens to you that's negative will trigger suicidal thoughts,</v>

228
00:07:58.221 --> 00:07:59.031
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>

229
00:07:59.031 --> 00:08:00.770
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes even positive things,</v>

230
00:08:00.771 --> 00:08:04.790
<v Speaker 1>we'll do it because there are very few positive things that happen that don't</v>

231
00:08:04.791 --> 00:08:05.624
<v Speaker 1>carry with them.</v>

232
00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.300
<v Speaker 1>Some threat of change or transformation.</v>

233
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:10.610
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

234
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:11.750
<v Speaker 1>one mystery,</v>

235
00:08:11.751 --> 00:08:16.280
<v Speaker 1>it's a big mystery is why don't you fall into a catastrophic depression every</v>

236
00:08:16.281 --> 00:08:17.840
<v Speaker 1>time something little goes wrong,</v>

237
00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:19.850
<v Speaker 1>because it's not.</v>

238
00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:22.310
<v Speaker 1>That level of analysis is not self evident.</v>

239
00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.400
<v Speaker 1>And you'll see this with people who are high in neuroticism too.</v>

240
00:08:25.401 --> 00:08:26.234
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

241
00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:28.310
<v Speaker 1>they're trivial</v>

242
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:35.060
<v Speaker 1>fluctuations at their workplace or in their relationships are in their health,</v>

243
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:39.500
<v Speaker 1>will produce a disproportionate negative emotional response.</v>

244
00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:39.890
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

245
00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:42.590
<v Speaker 1>it's part of the range of normal emotional responses.</v>

246
00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:43.730
<v Speaker 1>Some people are very,</v>

247
00:08:43.731 --> 00:08:44.840
<v Speaker 1>very high in neuroticism,</v>

248
00:08:44.841 --> 00:08:46.130
<v Speaker 1>so everything upsets them.</v>

249
00:08:46.131 --> 00:08:47.360
<v Speaker 1>Some people are very low.</v>

250
00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:51.320
<v Speaker 1>And the reason that whole range exists is because sometimes you should get upset</v>

251
00:08:51.321 --> 00:08:54.650
<v Speaker 1>when some little thing happens to you because it's an indication that the whole</v>

252
00:08:54.651 --> 00:08:56.580
<v Speaker 1>damn environment has got dangerous on you.</v>

253
00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:00.260
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes you should just brush it off because you know it's,</v>

254
00:09:00.261 --> 00:09:02.850
<v Speaker 1>it's net consequence is low.</v>

255
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.160
<v Speaker 1>But how do you calculate that?</v>

256
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:05.821
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

257
00:09:05.821 --> 00:09:06.960
<v Speaker 1>very difficult question.</v>

258
00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:08.401
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

259
00:09:08.401 --> 00:09:09.900
<v Speaker 1>when your computer goes wrong,</v>

260
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:14.550
<v Speaker 1>well you have to pick the proper level of analysis to fix it.</v>

261
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:15.720
<v Speaker 1>And you could say,</v>

262
00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:16.410
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

263
00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:18.540
<v Speaker 1>there's something wrong with the circuit board and maybe,</v>

264
00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:18.871
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

265
00:09:18.871 --> 00:09:20.160
<v Speaker 1>there's a crack in one of the,</v>

266
00:09:20.161 --> 00:09:20.994
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

267
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:26.150
<v Speaker 1>and one of the US somewhere that it's soldered or you know,</v>

268
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:29.730
<v Speaker 1>sometimes now when people are building</v>

269
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:32.220
<v Speaker 1>microchips,</v>

270
00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:34.890
<v Speaker 1>they've run into a crazy problem.</v>

271
00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:37.800
<v Speaker 1>No microchips keep getting smaller and smaller and smaller.</v>

272
00:09:37.801 --> 00:09:37.981
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

273
00:09:37.981 --> 00:09:39.300
<v Speaker 1>And so the little wires,</v>

274
00:09:39.301 --> 00:09:42.720
<v Speaker 1>now we're down to atomic width or you know,</v>

275
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.760
<v Speaker 1>the width of maybe 20 items or something like that.</v>

276
00:09:44.761 --> 00:09:45.361
<v Speaker 1>But really,</v>

277
00:09:45.361 --> 00:09:47.280
<v Speaker 1>really they're really getting thin.</v>

278
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.460
<v Speaker 1>And so that produces another problem,</v>

279
00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.590
<v Speaker 1>which no one would have ever.</v>

280
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:53.370
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

281
00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:53.581
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

282
00:09:53.581 --> 00:09:54.690
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't expect.</v>

283
00:09:54.691 --> 00:09:55.111
<v Speaker 1>And that is,</v>

284
00:09:55.111 --> 00:10:00.030
<v Speaker 1>you know that at the quantum level there's uncertainty about where electrons</v>

285
00:10:00.031 --> 00:10:01.750
<v Speaker 1>might be normally out,</v>

286
00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:02.593
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter.</v>

287
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:06.630
<v Speaker 1>The degree of uncertainty about where your electrons are is small enough at your</v>

288
00:10:06.631 --> 00:10:08.520
<v Speaker 1>size so that it's basically irrelevant.</v>

289
00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:12.510
<v Speaker 1>But down at the subatomic level where these microchips are starting to be</v>

290
00:10:12.511 --> 00:10:13.290
<v Speaker 1>produced,</v>

291
00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:15.810
<v Speaker 1>sometimes the electrons will be outside the wires.</v>

292
00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:18.930
<v Speaker 1>And that means that they're getting Sadam small that they'll short circuit by</v>

293
00:10:18.931 --> 00:10:22.380
<v Speaker 1>themselves because the electrons aren't stable enough to be where they're</v>

294
00:10:22.381 --> 00:10:23.610
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be in the wires.</v>

295
00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:24.903
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

296
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:30.500
<v Speaker 1>well the reason I'm pointing that out is because a problem that exists in the</v>

297
00:10:30.961 --> 00:10:34.650
<v Speaker 1>system can exist at any of the multiple levels of that system.</v>

298
00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:36.540
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't obvious where to start.</v>

299
00:10:36.541 --> 00:10:38.040
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of political arguments are,</v>

300
00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:38.880
<v Speaker 1>are like that.</v>

301
00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:39.630
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

302
00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:44.610
<v Speaker 1>it's like maybe a company goes bankrupt and its shareholders get,</v>

303
00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.240
<v Speaker 1>maybe a bank fails and so people can't withdraw their money.</v>

304
00:10:48.241 --> 00:10:49.780
<v Speaker 1>And one response is,</v>

305
00:10:49.781 --> 00:10:52.620
<v Speaker 1>well that just shows you how rotten the capitalist system is.</v>

306
00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:53.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

307
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:55.770
<v Speaker 1>well maybe that is what it shows.</v>

308
00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:58.260
<v Speaker 1>But it seems there's,</v>

309
00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:01.860
<v Speaker 1>it seems like that might not be the most appropriate level to start.</v>

310
00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:03.241
<v Speaker 1>And so again,</v>

311
00:11:03.241 --> 00:11:03.421
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

312
00:11:03.421 --> 00:11:05.880
<v Speaker 1>it's like Ockham's razor in the scientific world,</v>

313
00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:06.660
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

314
00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:11.580
<v Speaker 1>You want to use the simplest explanation that it's not that fits the facts</v>

315
00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:14.250
<v Speaker 1>because you don't organize your perceptions by facts.</v>

316
00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.820
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like you want to use the simplest tool you can possibly manage to</v>

317
00:11:17.821 --> 00:11:19.830
<v Speaker 1>fix the problem so you don't,</v>

318
00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:21.750
<v Speaker 1>when your car has a flat tire,</v>

319
00:11:21.751 --> 00:11:22.890
<v Speaker 1>you don't buy a new car,</v>

320
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:26.580
<v Speaker 1>you fix the flat tire if you can figure out how to do it.</v>

321
00:11:26.581 --> 00:11:28.280
<v Speaker 1>And so you go for the salon,</v>

322
00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:33.330
<v Speaker 1>the thing that will put the tool back together with the minimum involvement of</v>

323
00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:34.223
<v Speaker 1>time and effort.</v>

324
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:35.220
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

325
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:40.050
<v Speaker 1>And you care about that because you have limited time and you have limited</v>

326
00:11:40.051 --> 00:11:44.880
<v Speaker 1>resources and so it makes sense for you to conserve them.</v>

327
00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:50.010
<v Speaker 1>And I'm telling you that partly for practical reasons too because this is a very</v>

328
00:11:50.011 --> 00:11:51.000
<v Speaker 1>useful thing to know.</v>

329
00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:52.800
<v Speaker 1>If you're arguing with someone,</v>

330
00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:57.040
<v Speaker 1>you want to argue about the smallest possible thing that you could argue about</v>

331
00:11:57.041 --> 00:11:58.240
<v Speaker 1>that might fix the problem.</v>

332
00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:00.490
<v Speaker 1>You want to really specify it.</v>

333
00:12:00.491 --> 00:12:05.491
<v Speaker 1>It's like what's going on at a micro level and what's the minimum that I would</v>

334
00:12:05.531 --> 00:12:07.930
<v Speaker 1>require to be satisfied with outcome?</v>

335
00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:09.580
<v Speaker 1>And if you're,</v>

336
00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:12.160
<v Speaker 1>this is especially true in intimate relationships,</v>

337
00:12:12.161 --> 00:12:15.520
<v Speaker 1>it's like if someone's bugging you and you want them to change,</v>

338
00:12:15.521 --> 00:12:15.941
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

339
00:12:15.941 --> 00:12:18.250
<v Speaker 1>well how can I be minimally bothered by this?</v>

340
00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:23.350
<v Speaker 1>And what's the tiniest amount of change I could request that might satisfy me?</v>

341
00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:26.770
<v Speaker 1>Because otherwise the argument will come unglued.</v>

342
00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.380
<v Speaker 1>And every time you guys try to discuss a problem,</v>

343
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.620
<v Speaker 1>you'll start talking about whether you should even be together and then you're</v>

344
00:12:32.621 --> 00:12:33.010
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

345
00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:36.180
<v Speaker 1>Cause you'll never solve a problem and then you won't be together cause you'll</v>

346
00:12:36.181 --> 00:12:37.180
<v Speaker 1>never solve a problem.</v>
