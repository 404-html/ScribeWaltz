00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.770
<v Speaker 1>Could you please discuss freewill and Sam Harris's and others' ideas of its</v>

2
00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:05.760
<v Speaker 1>non-existence?</v>

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:06.331
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4
00:00:06.331 --> 00:00:08.610
<v Speaker 1>that's a good complicated question to kick things off.</v>

5
00:00:08.611 --> 00:00:12.840
<v Speaker 1>So I want to tell you a little bit about how to conceptualize freewill.</v>

6
00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:17.841
<v Speaker 1>I think first because it's obvious that we don't have infinite free will are our</v>

7
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:18.923
<v Speaker 1>choice.</v>

8
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.540
<v Speaker 1>Our choices are constrained in all sorts of ways.</v>

9
00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:23.500
<v Speaker 1>And I think part of the reason that there's a,</v>

10
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.010
<v Speaker 1>a continual discussion about freewill and the philosophical and the</v>

11
00:00:29.011 --> 00:00:30.810
<v Speaker 1>philosophical literature is because</v>

12
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.510
<v Speaker 1>just conceptualizing the issue properly is extraordinarily difficult.</v>

13
00:00:36.511 --> 00:00:38.220
<v Speaker 1>So I like to think about it,</v>

14
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:39.750
<v Speaker 1>at least in part,</v>

15
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.520
<v Speaker 1>the way that you think about a game.</v>

16
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

17
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.920
<v Speaker 1>if you're playing a game,</v>

18
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.420
<v Speaker 1>obviously the game has rules.</v>

19
00:00:45.421 --> 00:00:47.700
<v Speaker 1>So if it's a chess game or a basketball game,</v>

20
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.540
<v Speaker 1>then there are things that you can do in and things that you can't do.</v>

21
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.370
<v Speaker 1>And but,</v>

22
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.171
<v Speaker 1>and so it's,</v>

23
00:00:54.171 --> 00:00:54.451
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

24
00:00:54.451 --> 00:00:55.260
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

25
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.720
<v Speaker 1>it's a closed world in some sense.</v>

26
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.700
<v Speaker 1>But the fact that there are things you can't do when you play a game also seemed</v>

27
00:01:02.701 --> 00:01:05.790
<v Speaker 1>to open up a universe of possibilities for things that you can do.</v>

28
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.090
<v Speaker 1>So chess obviously constraints you to a board and to a certain number of men and</v>

29
00:01:11.461 --> 00:01:13.050
<v Speaker 1>to a certain pattern of rules.</v>

30
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.430
<v Speaker 1>But the strange thing is,</v>

31
00:01:14.431 --> 00:01:16.470
<v Speaker 1>is that when you put in those rules,</v>

32
00:01:16.471 --> 00:01:17.850
<v Speaker 1>because rules sound like limits,</v>

33
00:01:17.851 --> 00:01:19.830
<v Speaker 1>they sound always like things you can't do.</v>

34
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.050
<v Speaker 1>But when you set up a constrained world like that and you lay out a system of</v>

35
00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:25.471
<v Speaker 1>rules,</v>

36
00:01:25.471 --> 00:01:27.480
<v Speaker 1>what you do is open up an infinity of,</v>

37
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.940
<v Speaker 1>of a near infinity of possibilities.</v>

38
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.080
<v Speaker 1>Same with music.</v>

39
00:01:31.081 --> 00:01:31.291
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

40
00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:32.880
<v Speaker 1>music has rules obviously,</v>

41
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.050
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

42
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.160
<v Speaker 1>and if you follow the rules,</v>

43
00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:37.800
<v Speaker 1>then you can make an infinite variety of music.</v>

44
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.233
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

45
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.711
<v Speaker 1>and so there's a,</v>

46
00:01:40.711 --> 00:01:45.120
<v Speaker 1>there's a very interesting dynamic that's hard to understand between constraint</v>

47
00:01:45.121 --> 00:01:46.050
<v Speaker 1>and possibility.</v>

48
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.400
<v Speaker 1>And there's a deep idea that's associated with that that I read in some Jewish</v>

49
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:51.470
<v Speaker 1>commentary on,</v>

50
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.070
<v Speaker 1>on the biblical stories that I,</v>

51
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.930
<v Speaker 1>I read a long time ago.</v>

52
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about the relationship between God and man.</v>

53
00:01:58.921 --> 00:02:01.680
<v Speaker 1>And the idea was that God,</v>

54
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:03.331
<v Speaker 1>imagine,</v>

55
00:02:03.331 --> 00:02:03.431
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

56
00:02:03.431 --> 00:02:06.000
<v Speaker 1>being with the classical attributes of God,</v>

57
00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:06.601
<v Speaker 1>omniscience,</v>

58
00:02:06.601 --> 00:02:08.250
<v Speaker 1>omnipotence and omnipresence,</v>

59
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:09.151
<v Speaker 1>all seeing,</v>

60
00:02:09.151 --> 00:02:10.560
<v Speaker 1>all knowing and all powerful.</v>

61
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.600
<v Speaker 1>What is it being like that lack,</v>

62
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.940
<v Speaker 1>and obviously the answer is nothing,</v>

63
00:02:14.941 --> 00:02:15.241
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

64
00:02:15.241 --> 00:02:20.241
<v Speaker 1>Because by definition those three traits provide for absence of limitation.</v>

65
00:02:22.021 --> 00:02:24.540
<v Speaker 1>But then that's exactly what's lacking is limitation.</v>

66
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.350
<v Speaker 1>And there's some strange connection between limitation.</v>

67
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.620
<v Speaker 1>And I was saying say limitation that that's rule governed as I mentioned before,</v>

68
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.850
<v Speaker 1>and the opening up of possibility.</v>

69
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.270
<v Speaker 1>So it isn't necessarily the case that now determine determinism and limitation</v>

70
00:02:41.431 --> 00:02:42.600
<v Speaker 1>aren't exactly the same thing,</v>

71
00:02:42.601 --> 00:02:44.910
<v Speaker 1>but they're analogous than they need to be discussed together.</v>

72
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.451
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

73
00:02:45.451 --> 00:02:46.140
<v Speaker 1>so now,</v>

74
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.940
<v Speaker 1>so that's the first thing is that our,</v>

75
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.260
<v Speaker 1>whatever our free choice is,</v>

76
00:02:49.261 --> 00:02:50.190
<v Speaker 1>it isn't limited.</v>

77
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.470
<v Speaker 1>It's limited,</v>

78
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.880
<v Speaker 1>it's deeply limited.</v>

79
00:02:53.881 --> 00:02:55.260
<v Speaker 1>Now here's another thing.</v>

80
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.170
<v Speaker 1>If I take my arm and I go like this,</v>

81
00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.470
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

82
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.303
<v Speaker 1>I'll do that again.</v>

83
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.500
<v Speaker 1>Now you see there's a movement like that and then my hands stopped just before</v>

84
00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:06.130
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

85
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 1>my other hand.</v>

86
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.010
<v Speaker 1>Now it takes a certain amount of time for the neural messages to go from my</v>

87
00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:17.011
<v Speaker 1>brain to my arm and back and the time it takes my hand to go like this and stop</v>

88
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.760
<v Speaker 1>is actually shorter than the time it takes a message to get to my brain.</v>

89
00:03:21.761 --> 00:03:22.540
<v Speaker 1>And back.</v>

90
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.190
<v Speaker 1>So what that means is that when I,</v>

91
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:26.590
<v Speaker 1>when I planned this movement,</v>

92
00:03:26.591 --> 00:03:28.330
<v Speaker 1>which is called a ballistic movement,</v>

93
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.610
<v Speaker 1>it's called a ballistic movement because it's like a bullet.</v>

94
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.660
<v Speaker 1>Once you let it go,</v>

95
00:03:31.661 --> 00:03:32.200
<v Speaker 1>it's gone.</v>

96
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.250
<v Speaker 1>There's no calling back.</v>

97
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.230
<v Speaker 1>I've actually organized the neurological and muscular sequences that enable that</v>

98
00:03:38.231 --> 00:03:40.540
<v Speaker 1>action before it's implemented.</v>

99
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.980
<v Speaker 1>I set all that up and then it's released and the whole thing cascades.</v>

100
00:03:44.981 --> 00:03:49.300
<v Speaker 1>And so once the action has been released,</v>

101
00:03:49.301 --> 00:03:50.134
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

102
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.830
<v Speaker 1>then I don't really have any free will because I can't stop it now.</v>

103
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.460
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

104
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.720
<v Speaker 1>so you think about that,</v>

105
00:03:55.721 --> 00:03:58.640
<v Speaker 1>it looks like there's a temporal gradient with regards to freewill.</v>

106
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.660
<v Speaker 1>Is that as you look out into the future meet perhaps the farther out you look</v>

107
00:04:03.671 --> 00:04:04.510
<v Speaker 1>into the future?</v>

108
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.830
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

109
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:06.970
<v Speaker 1>the farther down the road,</v>

110
00:04:06.971 --> 00:04:07.804
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

111
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.030
<v Speaker 1>the more free your choices are,</v>

112
00:04:10.031 --> 00:04:12.010
<v Speaker 1>but the closer they get to implementation,</v>

113
00:04:12.011 --> 00:04:17.011
<v Speaker 1>the more they become deterministic governed by standard cause a processes.</v>

114
00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:22.060
<v Speaker 1>And there's some transition point where they change from being what we would</v>

115
00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:24.790
<v Speaker 1>describe as choice that we haven't got to free choice yet,</v>

116
00:04:24.791 --> 00:04:25.810
<v Speaker 1>but at least to choice.</v>

117
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.110
<v Speaker 1>There's some transition point between now and ballistic movement.</v>

118
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:30.610
<v Speaker 1>Here's another way of thinking about it.</v>

119
00:04:30.611 --> 00:04:31.720
<v Speaker 1>Like we know for example,</v>

120
00:04:31.721 --> 00:04:36.130
<v Speaker 1>that people who are expert at playing the piano look ahead of where they're</v>

121
00:04:36.131 --> 00:04:38.320
<v Speaker 1>playing and,</v>

122
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.760
<v Speaker 1>and they're doing the same thing.</v>

123
00:04:39.761 --> 00:04:40.810
<v Speaker 1>They're watching the notes,</v>

124
00:04:40.811 --> 00:04:42.190
<v Speaker 1>they're seeing where they're going,</v>

125
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.920
<v Speaker 1>but and then their disinhibiting,</v>

126
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.180
<v Speaker 1>the automated structures that enabled them to play what they've practiced so</v>

127
00:04:49.181 --> 00:04:49.870
<v Speaker 1>thoroughly.</v>

128
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:50.980
<v Speaker 1>They're disinhibited.</v>

129
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.910
<v Speaker 1>Those structures,</v>

130
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.780
<v Speaker 1>and then they go automatically and then what happens if you make a mistake is</v>

131
00:04:55.781 --> 00:05:00.781
<v Speaker 1>that consciousness notes the error and then unpacks the motor sequences that</v>

132
00:05:01.181 --> 00:05:02.740
<v Speaker 1>have been practiced and then you read,</v>

133
00:05:02.741 --> 00:05:05.770
<v Speaker 1>practice them and sequenced them again until they become automatic and</v>

134
00:05:05.771 --> 00:05:06.610
<v Speaker 1>deterministic.</v>

135
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.800
<v Speaker 1>So there's choice in that.</v>

136
00:05:08.801 --> 00:05:10.150
<v Speaker 1>You're reading ahead,</v>

137
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.710
<v Speaker 1>but there's no choice in that.</v>

138
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.170
<v Speaker 1>Once you've read ahead and disinhibited the actions,</v>

139
00:05:14.171 --> 00:05:17.650
<v Speaker 1>then they run ballistically and then you can think about the same thing that's</v>

140
00:05:17.651 --> 00:05:19.330
<v Speaker 1>happening when you're driving in a car.</v>

141
00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.740
<v Speaker 1>You don't look right in front of you when you're driving a car because whatever</v>

142
00:05:23.741 --> 00:05:24.670
<v Speaker 1>is right in front of you,</v>

143
00:05:24.671 --> 00:05:26.020
<v Speaker 1>if you're going 40 miles an hour,</v>

144
00:05:26.021 --> 00:05:27.850
<v Speaker 1>whatever you've already run over,</v>

145
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.490
<v Speaker 1>you look a quarter of a mile down the road.</v>

146
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.490
<v Speaker 1>And that gives you the opportunity to see what's coming.</v>

147
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.880
<v Speaker 1>And to set up a sequence of increasingly automated movements that culminate in</v>

148
00:05:39.131 --> 00:05:41.080
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is that you're doing while you're driving.</v>

149
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.980
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a gradation from choice to determinism,</v>

150
00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.450
<v Speaker 1>a temporal gradation.</v>

151
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:47.150
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

152
00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.760
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

153
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't often see that addressed when people talk about will and now Sam's issue</v>

154
00:05:53.021 --> 00:05:58.021
<v Speaker 1>with freewill is that if you get someone to do something like lift their finger</v>

155
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:00.560
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>

156
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.950
<v Speaker 1>and you scan their brains using a variety of techniques while they're doing</v>

157
00:06:03.951 --> 00:06:04.430
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

158
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.900
<v Speaker 1>what you'll see is that there's an action potential that emerge and you ask them</v>

159
00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:10.270
<v Speaker 1>to voluntarily move their fingers.</v>

160
00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:11.103
<v Speaker 1>So they're doing it,</v>

161
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.440
<v Speaker 1>let's say by free choice,</v>

162
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.290
<v Speaker 1>there's an action potential that you can,</v>

163
00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.270
<v Speaker 1>that you can read off the brain that occurs before the person either moves their</v>

164
00:06:20.271 --> 00:06:23.090
<v Speaker 1>finger or let's say decides to move their finger.</v>

165
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:28.190
<v Speaker 1>And that occurs quite a bit before the feeling of volunteerism or that voluntary</v>

166
00:06:28.191 --> 00:06:28.521
<v Speaker 1>act.</v>

167
00:06:28.521 --> 00:06:32.360
<v Speaker 1>And so that's been read by Benjamin Libet who did the experiments,</v>

168
00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:33.530
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

169
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:38.000
<v Speaker 1>as indication that even the feeling of voluntary choices determined.</v>

170
00:06:38.001 --> 00:06:43.001
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think that that's a very useful way of addressing the issue because</v>

171
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:50.050
<v Speaker 1>the issue of when you lift your finger up again is it requires pre-programming</v>

172
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:51.621
<v Speaker 1>to disinhibit.</v>

173
00:06:51.621 --> 00:06:52.970
<v Speaker 1>Like you know how to do this right.</v>

174
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:54.740
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to learn to do that.</v>

175
00:06:54.741 --> 00:06:57.410
<v Speaker 1>So you have a little automated circuit that does this sort of thing.</v>

176
00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.090
<v Speaker 1>All these finger movements and everything,</v>

177
00:06:59.091 --> 00:07:02.780
<v Speaker 1>you can see babies practicing them and they develop automated circuitry that</v>

178
00:07:02.781 --> 00:07:07.250
<v Speaker 1>tends to be posterior left hemisphere in order to run those,</v>

179
00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:08.960
<v Speaker 1>those automated processes out.</v>

180
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:13.580
<v Speaker 1>And what you're basically doing when you decide to do something that's a routine</v>

181
00:07:13.581 --> 00:07:15.080
<v Speaker 1>that you've already practiced or,</v>

182
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.440
<v Speaker 1>or made out of sub routines that you've already practiced is disinhibiting them.</v>

183
00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.130
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

184
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.790
<v Speaker 1>the degree to which you might regard that as free.</v>

185
00:07:22.791 --> 00:07:26.150
<v Speaker 1>Exactly is unclear as are the temporal limitations.</v>

186
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:30.560
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think that Liberty's experiments demonstrate conclusively that</v>

187
00:07:30.561 --> 00:07:31.970
<v Speaker 1>there's no such thing as free will,</v>

188
00:07:31.971 --> 00:07:35.990
<v Speaker 1>even though there are action potentials that indicate that there is brain</v>

189
00:07:35.991 --> 00:07:37.220
<v Speaker 1>activity signaling,</v>

190
00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:39.290
<v Speaker 1>even the onset of a voluntary choice,</v>

191
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.393
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

192
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:42.530
<v Speaker 1>voluntary choice early.</v>

193
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:44.263
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

194
00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:45.110
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

195
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:48.470
<v Speaker 1>another thing that we might look at in relationship to that is,</v>

196
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:49.363
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

197
00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:50.443
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

198
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:54.710
<v Speaker 1>so we can look at it phenomenologically and we could also look at it in,</v>

199
00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:55.280
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

200
00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.500
<v Speaker 1>in relationship to how people treat one another.</v>

201
00:07:57.501 --> 00:08:02.501
<v Speaker 1>So phenomenologically it seems clear that we have free choice and it isn't</v>

202
00:08:02.661 --> 00:08:06.620
<v Speaker 1>obvious to me why we have consciousness if free choice isn't real because</v>

203
00:08:06.621 --> 00:08:11.300
<v Speaker 1>consciousness looks to me like a mechanism that deals with potential before it's</v>

204
00:08:11.301 --> 00:08:13.010
<v Speaker 1>transformed into actuality,</v>

205
00:08:13.011 --> 00:08:13.844
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

206
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.380
<v Speaker 1>And I think consciousness is also that the faculty,</v>

207
00:08:18.381 --> 00:08:19.161
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

208
00:08:19.161 --> 00:08:23.870
<v Speaker 1>or a manifestation of the faculty that enables us to preprogram deterministic</v>

209
00:08:23.871 --> 00:08:24.470
<v Speaker 1>actions.</v>

210
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:24.951
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>

211
00:08:24.951 --> 00:08:26.600
<v Speaker 1>let's think about someone playing the piano.</v>

212
00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:27.830
<v Speaker 1>They're practicing,</v>

213
00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:28.161
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

214
00:08:28.161 --> 00:08:30.840
<v Speaker 1>after you repeat and you repeat your,</v>

215
00:08:30.841 --> 00:08:32.540
<v Speaker 1>your finger movements if you're playing the piano,</v>

216
00:08:32.541 --> 00:08:34.250
<v Speaker 1>any complex motor skill is like that.</v>

217
00:08:34.251 --> 00:08:36.440
<v Speaker 1>You have to repeat it and repeat it and repeat it and repeat it.</v>

218
00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:39.500
<v Speaker 1>And you're using consciousness to program it,</v>

219
00:08:39.501 --> 00:08:42.530
<v Speaker 1>to sequence the motor movements and to pay attention to them.</v>

220
00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:46.910
<v Speaker 1>That all seems voluntary and it involves the activation of a tremendous amount</v>

221
00:08:46.911 --> 00:08:48.860
<v Speaker 1>of your brain because if you're doing something new,</v>

222
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:52.460
<v Speaker 1>a lot of your brain is activated and then as you practice it,</v>

223
00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:56.490
<v Speaker 1>the amount of brain that's activated decreases.</v>

224
00:08:56.491 --> 00:09:01.491
<v Speaker 1>It shifts from right to left and then it shifts from frontal to posterior and a</v>

225
00:09:02.551 --> 00:09:03.780
<v Speaker 1>smaller and smaller area.</v>

226
00:09:03.781 --> 00:09:07.590
<v Speaker 1>So what's happening is that consciousness is creating little machines in the</v>

227
00:09:07.591 --> 00:09:10.650
<v Speaker 1>back of your head that do things in an automated manner.</v>

228
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:11.963
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

229
00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:16.960
<v Speaker 1>the the,</v>

230
00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:21.850
<v Speaker 1>the volume that consciousness looks like consciousness appears and feels that</v>

231
00:09:21.851 --> 00:09:25.270
<v Speaker 1>would be the phenomenal logical land as if it's doing that voluntarily and it is</v>

232
00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:27.850
<v Speaker 1>associated with a different pattern of brain activity.</v>

233
00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.193
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

234
00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:29.951
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

235
00:09:29.951 --> 00:09:30.611
<v Speaker 1>so there's that,</v>

236
00:09:30.611 --> 00:09:35.611
<v Speaker 1>there's the long phenomenological reality of voluntary choice and effort as</v>

237
00:09:35.711 --> 00:09:35.951
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

238
00:09:35.951 --> 00:09:38.650
<v Speaker 1>Cause conscious programming of that sort is also effortful.</v>

239
00:09:38.651 --> 00:09:41.440
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem to run deterministically like a clock does.</v>

240
00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:43.330
<v Speaker 1>And then finally,</v>

241
00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.040
<v Speaker 1>there's also,</v>

242
00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:49.180
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know what you think about this with regards to evidence,</v>

243
00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:53.500
<v Speaker 1>but what constitutes evidence is not always that easy to determine even in in</v>

244
00:09:53.501 --> 00:09:54.430
<v Speaker 1>the scientific domain.</v>

245
00:09:54.431 --> 00:09:56.330
<v Speaker 1>So imagine,</v>

246
00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:00.190
<v Speaker 1>think about how we think about ourselves and other people and how we treat</v>

247
00:10:00.191 --> 00:10:01.330
<v Speaker 1>ourselves and other people.</v>

248
00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:06.040
<v Speaker 1>You could imagine that you're like a clock running down and that's like a</v>

249
00:10:06.041 --> 00:10:07.090
<v Speaker 1>deterministic model,</v>

250
00:10:07.091 --> 00:10:07.781
<v Speaker 1>but people aren't,</v>

251
00:10:07.781 --> 00:10:09.520
<v Speaker 1>clocks were dissipative structures.</v>

252
00:10:09.521 --> 00:10:12.070
<v Speaker 1>A clock is something that runs downhill.</v>

253
00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:13.150
<v Speaker 1>But human beings,</v>

254
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:15.820
<v Speaker 1>you can look up dissipative structure.</v>

255
00:10:15.821 --> 00:10:19.990
<v Speaker 1>I think that was an idea that was first formulated by the physicist Schrodinger</v>

256
00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:21.813
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

257
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:23.551
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

258
00:10:23.551 --> 00:10:23.911
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

259
00:10:23.911 --> 00:10:24.420
<v Speaker 1>we're not,</v>

260
00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:27.000
<v Speaker 1>we're not clocks by any stretch of the imagination.</v>

261
00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:31.080
<v Speaker 1>And we take energy in and we disperse energy and,</v>

262
00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:35.220
<v Speaker 1>and we were anti entropic in an in a temporary sense.</v>

263
00:10:35.221 --> 00:10:35.851
<v Speaker 1>So that makes us,</v>

264
00:10:35.851 --> 00:10:35.991
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

265
00:10:35.991 --> 00:10:36.421
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

266
00:10:36.421 --> 00:10:40.020
<v Speaker 1>and life is as well shorting a wrote about that in a book called what is life?</v>

267
00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:41.663
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

268
00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:43.290
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

269
00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:45.150
<v Speaker 1>we don't what we seem to do,</v>

270
00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.530
<v Speaker 1>this is how it looks to me.</v>

271
00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:51.240
<v Speaker 1>We don't contend with the present and we're not driven by the past.</v>

272
00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:52.021
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

273
00:10:52.021 --> 00:10:55.680
<v Speaker 1>what we see in front of us is a landscape of possibility.</v>

274
00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.170
<v Speaker 1>And my wilder moments,</v>

275
00:10:58.171 --> 00:11:01.590
<v Speaker 1>I think that's associated with the physical idea of multiple universes.</v>

276
00:11:01.591 --> 00:11:03.720
<v Speaker 1>But that's in my wilder moments.</v>

277
00:11:03.721 --> 00:11:04.980
<v Speaker 1>It's just a speculation.</v>

278
00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:06.960
<v Speaker 1>And so what we see in front of us is,</v>

279
00:11:06.961 --> 00:11:07.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

280
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:09.450
<v Speaker 1>an array of potential universes.</v>

281
00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:12.810
<v Speaker 1>And those are the universes that we could bring about as a consequence of our</v>

282
00:11:12.811 --> 00:11:14.460
<v Speaker 1>actions and it,</v>

283
00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.010
<v Speaker 1>and we make choices to the right or the left.</v>

284
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.880
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of mythological speculation about that sort of idea to in an</v>

285
00:11:20.881 --> 00:11:21.571
<v Speaker 1>ethical sense,</v>

286
00:11:21.571 --> 00:11:25.530
<v Speaker 1>cause we decide what sort of reality that we want to bring into being.</v>

287
00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:30.800
<v Speaker 1>And so we encounter potential like God did at the beginning of time when he made</v>

288
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:33.390
<v Speaker 1>order out of chaos.</v>

289
00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:35.100
<v Speaker 1>Chaos is this chaotic potential.</v>

290
00:11:35.101 --> 00:11:38.970
<v Speaker 1>We confront chaotic potential with our consciousness and we cast that into</v>

291
00:11:38.971 --> 00:11:42.570
<v Speaker 1>reality and that now then you think,</v>

292
00:11:42.571 --> 00:11:43.260
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

293
00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:44.550
<v Speaker 1>is that really the case?</v>

294
00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:45.893
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

295
00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.650
<v Speaker 1>that's hard to say because there are limits to our knowledge about consciousness</v>

296
00:11:49.651 --> 00:11:50.401
<v Speaker 1>and about reality.</v>

297
00:11:50.401 --> 00:11:55.090
<v Speaker 1>But if you treat yourself like you're a free moral agent with choice and that</v>

298
00:11:55.091 --> 00:11:57.460
<v Speaker 1>you can determine the course of your life,</v>

299
00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:01.540
<v Speaker 1>then you seem to get along better with yourself and to be less anxious and to be</v>

300
00:12:01.541 --> 00:12:02.374
<v Speaker 1>more productive.</v>

301
00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:04.840
<v Speaker 1>And if you treat other people like that,</v>

302
00:12:04.841 --> 00:12:08.380
<v Speaker 1>that they're free agents that are making voluntary choices about how reality is</v>

303
00:12:08.381 --> 00:12:12.340
<v Speaker 1>going to come into being and you reward them when they do it properly and you</v>

304
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:13.383
<v Speaker 1>punish them,</v>

305
00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:13.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

306
00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.330
<v Speaker 1>or otherwise discipline them when they don't,</v>

307
00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:17.410
<v Speaker 1>when they do it badly,</v>

308
00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:20.680
<v Speaker 1>then your relationships with them seem to work.</v>

309
00:12:20.681 --> 00:12:25.681
<v Speaker 1>And then if we predicate our society on the presupposition that each individual</v>

310
00:12:26.381 --> 00:12:28.780
<v Speaker 1>human being is capable of doing just that,</v>

311
00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:31.720
<v Speaker 1>then we seem to have extremely functional societies.</v>

312
00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:32.830
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

313
00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:36.520
<v Speaker 1>and this is something that Sam Harris has been taken to task for many times,</v>

314
00:12:36.521 --> 00:12:39.070
<v Speaker 1>is if you dispense with the idea of free will,</v>

315
00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:43.000
<v Speaker 1>how is it you organize your relationship to yourself,</v>

316
00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.600
<v Speaker 1>your interactions with your family and your relationships with the broader</v>

317
00:12:46.601 --> 00:12:47.830
<v Speaker 1>social community?</v>

318
00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.360
<v Speaker 1>It's a very complicated issue.</v>

319
00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:54.720
<v Speaker 1>So I believe strongly that we have freewill,</v>

320
00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:56.800
<v Speaker 1>that we're responsible for our choices.</v>

321
00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:59.170
<v Speaker 1>Those choices are constrained in many,</v>

322
00:12:59.171 --> 00:13:00.004
<v Speaker 1>many ways.</v>

323
00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:05.340
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a gradient of freewill from free out into the future to</v>

324
00:13:05.981 --> 00:13:10.570
<v Speaker 1>increasingly constrained as the present manifest itself to deterministic in the</v>

325
00:13:10.571 --> 00:13:11.380
<v Speaker 1>moment when,</v>

326
00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:14.290
<v Speaker 1>when in the moment of action we,</v>

327
00:13:14.291 --> 00:13:18.280
<v Speaker 1>and you might think that we entered the realm of deterministic causality at the</v>

328
00:13:18.281 --> 00:13:19.061
<v Speaker 1>moment of action,</v>

329
00:13:19.061 --> 00:13:19.900
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

330
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.400
<v Speaker 1>That's how it looks to me.</v>

331
00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:22.773
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

332
00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:23.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

333
00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:24.910
<v Speaker 1>so at this rate,</v>

334
00:13:24.911 --> 00:13:26.790
<v Speaker 1>we're going to answer about five questions so that,</v>

335
00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:27.551
<v Speaker 1>but that was a very,</v>

336
00:13:27.551 --> 00:13:28.241
<v Speaker 1>very hard one.</v>

337
00:13:28.241 --> 00:13:29.080
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

338
00:13:29.081 --> 00:13:30.070
<v Speaker 1>I hope that's helpful.</v>
