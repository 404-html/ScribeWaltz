00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.430
<v Speaker 1>No young was a student of niches you see.</v>

2
00:00:11.431 --> 00:00:13.260
<v Speaker 1>And he was also,</v>

3
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.780
<v Speaker 1>I would say at the very astute critic of nature,</v>

4
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.050
<v Speaker 1>he was educated by Freud and Freud.</v>

5
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:20.760
<v Speaker 1>Freud,</v>

6
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.340
<v Speaker 1>I suppose in some sense started to collate,</v>

7
00:00:23.341 --> 00:00:27.750
<v Speaker 1>collate the information that we had pertaining to the notion that people lived</v>

8
00:00:27.751 --> 00:00:28.680
<v Speaker 1>inside a dream.</v>

9
00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:28.891
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

10
00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:32.870
<v Speaker 1>it was Freud who really popularized the idea of the unconscious mind.</v>

11
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.740
<v Speaker 1>And we take this for granted to such a degree today that we don't understand how</v>

12
00:00:37.741 --> 00:00:39.180
<v Speaker 1>revolutionary the idea was.</v>

13
00:00:39.181 --> 00:00:42.930
<v Speaker 1>Like with what's happened with Freud is that we've taken all the marrow out of</v>

14
00:00:42.931 --> 00:00:44.310
<v Speaker 1>his bones so to speak,</v>

15
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.990
<v Speaker 1>less the husk behind.</v>

16
00:00:45.991 --> 00:00:46.910
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

17
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.270
<v Speaker 1>now when we think about Freud,</v>

18
00:00:48.271 --> 00:00:51.750
<v Speaker 1>we just think about the husk because that's everything that's been discarded.</v>

19
00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:55.050
<v Speaker 1>But so much of what he discovered as part of our popular conception now</v>

20
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.280
<v Speaker 1>including the idea that your perceptions and your actions and your thoughts are</v>

21
00:00:59.281 --> 00:01:00.114
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

22
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

23
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.620
<v Speaker 1>what would you say?</v>

24
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.620
<v Speaker 1>Informed and shaped by unconscious motivations that are not part of your</v>

25
00:01:06.931 --> 00:01:07.950
<v Speaker 1>voluntary control.</v>

26
00:01:07.951 --> 00:01:08.880
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very,</v>

27
00:01:08.881 --> 00:01:09.990
<v Speaker 1>very strange thing.</v>

28
00:01:09.991 --> 00:01:14.340
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the most unsettling things about the psychoanalytic theories.</v>

29
00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:18.810
<v Speaker 1>Cause the psychoanalytic theories or something like you're a loose collection of</v>

30
00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:23.760
<v Speaker 1>living sub personalities each with its own set of motivations and perceptions</v>

31
00:01:23.761 --> 00:01:25.260
<v Speaker 1>and emotions and rationales,</v>

32
00:01:25.261 --> 00:01:26.220
<v Speaker 1>all of that,</v>

33
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.590
<v Speaker 1>and you have limited control over that.</v>

34
00:01:28.591 --> 00:01:30.270
<v Speaker 1>So you're like a plurality of,</v>

35
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.960
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

36
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.320
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

37
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.130
<v Speaker 1>of internal personalities that's loosely late into a unity.</v>

38
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.180
<v Speaker 1>You know that because you can't control yourself very well,</v>

39
00:01:39.181 --> 00:01:43.080
<v Speaker 1>which is one of Hume's objections to Nietzsche's idea that we could create our</v>

40
00:01:43.081 --> 00:01:43.890
<v Speaker 1>own values.</v>

41
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.330
<v Speaker 1>So young didn't believe that,</v>

42
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.380
<v Speaker 1>especially not after interacting with Freud because he saw that human beings</v>

43
00:01:49.381 --> 00:01:51.840
<v Speaker 1>were affected by things that were deeply,</v>

44
00:01:51.841 --> 00:01:54.990
<v Speaker 1>deeply effected by things that were beyond their conscious control.</v>

45
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.780
<v Speaker 1>And no one really knows how to conceptualize those things.</v>

46
00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.291
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

47
00:01:58.291 --> 00:02:00.900
<v Speaker 1>the cognitive psychologists think about them in some senses,</v>

48
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.990
<v Speaker 1>computational machines and the ancient people,</v>

49
00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:05.490
<v Speaker 1>I think thought of them as God's,</v>

50
00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:07.050
<v Speaker 1>although it's more complex than that,</v>

51
00:02:07.051 --> 00:02:08.610
<v Speaker 1>like rage would be a god.</v>

52
00:02:08.611 --> 00:02:09.444
<v Speaker 1>Mars,</v>

53
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.800
<v Speaker 1>the god of rage.</v>

54
00:02:10.801 --> 00:02:13.080
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing that possesses you when you're angry,</v>

55
00:02:13.081 --> 00:02:13.291
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

56
00:02:13.291 --> 00:02:14.540
<v Speaker 1>it has a viewpoint and it,</v>

57
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:15.110
<v Speaker 1>it it,</v>

58
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.190
<v Speaker 1>it says what it wants to say.</v>

59
00:02:17.191 --> 00:02:20.070
<v Speaker 1>And that might have very little to do with what you want to say when you're</v>

60
00:02:20.071 --> 00:02:22.530
<v Speaker 1>being sensible and it doesn't just inhabit.</v>

61
00:02:22.531 --> 00:02:26.910
<v Speaker 1>You had inhabits everyone and it lives forever and it even inhabits animals.</v>

62
00:02:26.911 --> 00:02:31.911
<v Speaker 1>And so it's this transcendent psychological entity that inhabits the body</v>

63
00:02:34.021 --> 00:02:34.990
<v Speaker 1>politic light,</v>

64
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.450
<v Speaker 1>like a thought in habits,</v>

65
00:02:36.451 --> 00:02:37.051
<v Speaker 1>the brain.</v>

66
00:02:37.051 --> 00:02:38.520
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>

67
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.260
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange way of thinking,</v>

68
00:02:40.261 --> 00:02:41.130
<v Speaker 1>but it certainly,</v>

69
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.280
<v Speaker 1>it certainly has its merits and so,</v>

70
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.031
<v Speaker 1>and those things,</v>

71
00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:45.990
<v Speaker 1>well in some sense,</v>

72
00:02:45.991 --> 00:02:46.710
<v Speaker 1>those are daddies.</v>
