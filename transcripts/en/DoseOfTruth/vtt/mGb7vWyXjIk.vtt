1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another thing that struck me about your</v>

2
00:00:01.921 --> 00:00:06.510
<v Speaker 1>book that was quite interesting I</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought was that you list the names of a</v>

3
00:00:06.511 --> 00:00:09.630
<v Speaker 1>very large number of totally unsung</v>
<v Speaker 1>heroes,</v>

4
00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are people and we have a very</v>

5
00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:15.150
<v Speaker 1>interesting table near the beginning</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you list,</v>

6
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.180
<v Speaker 1>I think about 10 names,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe 12 of people who've saved between</v>

7
00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:23.880
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of billions and billions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives with their scientific,</v>

8
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.310
<v Speaker 1>with their incremental scientific</v>
<v Speaker 1>productivity.</v>

9
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.820
<v Speaker 1>And yet those are people that are by no</v>
<v Speaker 1>means household names.</v>

10
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.430
<v Speaker 1>That's another place where things don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>make the news.</v>

11
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:33.830
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

12
00:00:33.831 --> 00:00:36.800
<v Speaker 2>And it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny how our</v>

13
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.690
<v Speaker 2>moral,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a crediting our moral,</v>

14
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.640
<v Speaker 2>our awarding of World Brownie points</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't quite correlate with how much</v>

15
00:00:46.641 --> 00:00:49.340
<v Speaker 2>good people often doesn't at all</v>
<v Speaker 2>correlate.</v>

16
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.010
<v Speaker 2>And the case of the inventors of</v>
<v Speaker 2>synthetic fertilizer,</v>

17
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.850
<v Speaker 2>of vaccines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of chlorination,</v>

18
00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.710
<v Speaker 2>of public water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>supplies of the green revolution in</v>

19
00:01:00.711 --> 00:01:03.410
<v Speaker 2>agriculture are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are pretty much unknown.</v>

20
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.440
<v Speaker 2>And they literally say billions of lives</v>
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>

21
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.930
<v Speaker 2>whereas various reformers and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

22
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:10.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

23
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.400
<v Speaker 2>profits and agitators are a pretty well</v>
<v Speaker 2>known.</v>

24
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.640
<v Speaker 2>A number of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

25
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly people who are painted by the</v>

26
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.080
<v Speaker 2>Roman Catholic Church who have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>perform a miracle that might resolve</v>

27
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.220
<v Speaker 2>resulted saving one life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course in fact did not because</v>

28
00:01:25.221 --> 00:01:29.000
<v Speaker 2>miracles don't happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that that definition of</v>

29
00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:34.001
<v Speaker 2>saint has nothing to do with saving</v>
<v Speaker 2>lives on scales of millions or billions</v>

30
00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.670
<v Speaker 2>to shows like human moral sense is not</v>
<v Speaker 2>really well calibrated to morality as we</v>

31
00:01:40.671 --> 00:01:41.970
<v Speaker 2>would have defended myself.</v>

32
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.700
<v Speaker 1>I think it was stolen who said something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a single death is a tragedy,</v>

33
00:01:47.781 --> 00:01:52.670
<v Speaker 1>but a million deaths is a statistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe didn't say it,</v>

34
00:01:52.671 --> 00:01:53.060
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.850
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a conventionally attributed to him.</v>

36
00:01:55.851 --> 00:01:58.760
<v Speaker 1>So let's say for good reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

37
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.360
<v Speaker 1>I suppose I could have said it to or I</v>
<v Speaker 1>guess maybe the same thing plays in</v>

38
00:02:04.431 --> 00:02:07.370
<v Speaker 1>reverse say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the saving of a single life has</v>

39
00:02:07.371 --> 00:02:12.260
<v Speaker 1>a narrative punch and the incremental</v>
<v Speaker 1>savings of 100 million lives,</v>

40
00:02:12.261 --> 00:02:14.960
<v Speaker 1>especially through prevention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another problem,</v>

41
00:02:14.961 --> 00:02:16.730
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because prevention isn't dramatic</v>

42
00:02:16.731 --> 00:02:19.100
<v Speaker 1>because the terrible thing merely</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't happen.</v>

43
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.330
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

44
00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.840
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I rather cheekily wrote an article on</v>

45
00:02:24.841 --> 00:02:27.950
<v Speaker 2>the human moral sense that began with a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who do you,</v>

46
00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.840
<v Speaker 2>who do you think is most a morally</v>
<v Speaker 2>Praiseworthy Mother Teresa or Bill Gates</v>

47
00:02:32.841 --> 00:02:37.280
<v Speaker 2>or Norman Borlaug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this was before a gates is pivot</v>

48
00:02:37.281 --> 00:02:40.770
<v Speaker 2>from a computer technology to</v>
<v Speaker 2>philanthropy was,</v>

49
00:02:40.771 --> 00:02:42.500
<v Speaker 2>was well known.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was about 10 years ago.</v>

50
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.680
<v Speaker 2>And I set it up as a bit of a trick</v>
<v Speaker 2>question because of course everyone</v>

51
00:02:45.681 --> 00:02:48.770
<v Speaker 2>would say mother Teresa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even in our field and in discussions</v>

52
00:02:48.771 --> 00:02:52.070
<v Speaker 2>with moral psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever a speaker has to pull out of</v>

53
00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:55.400
<v Speaker 2>the air and example of a particularly</v>
<v Speaker 2>moral person,</v>

54
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.580
<v Speaker 2>Mother Teresa is the stereotype.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though if you ask people,</v>

55
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.610
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did she accomplish?</v>

56
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.470
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many lives did she save?</v>

57
00:03:02.471 --> 00:03:05.440
<v Speaker 2>How many sick people did she actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>cure?</v>

58
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.960
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very hard to come up with,</v>

59
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.320
<v Speaker 2>for actual accomplishment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does Bill Gates has already been</v>

60
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.040
<v Speaker 2>credited with saving perhaps $100</v>
<v Speaker 2>million lives through his efforts to</v>

61
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.430
<v Speaker 2>eliminate affection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>infectious disease living world.</v>

62
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.500
<v Speaker 2>And Norman Borlaug won the Nobel Peace</v>
<v Speaker 2>Prize in 1970 for his role in a</v>

63
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.320
<v Speaker 2>fermenting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The green revolution probably saved a</v>

64
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.100
<v Speaker 2>billion lives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>selective breeding of hybrid crops that</v>

65
00:03:30.101 --> 00:03:34.420
<v Speaker 2>required less fertilizer that could be</v>
<v Speaker 2>grown twice a year,</v>

66
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.820
<v Speaker 2>less water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>higher yields,</v>

67
00:03:36.821 --> 00:03:41.821
<v Speaker 2>less susceptibility to disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which countries like Mexico and India</v>

68
00:03:41.861 --> 00:03:45.770
<v Speaker 2>from a from basket cases to exporters of</v>
<v Speaker 2>food in,</v>

69
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.290
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in less than a decade.</v>

70
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.390
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that would be a story that</v>

71
00:03:49.391 --> 00:03:53.200
<v Speaker 1>everyone in in elementary and junior</v>
<v Speaker 1>high school would learn because it's</v>

72
00:03:53.201 --> 00:03:56.560
<v Speaker 1>such a remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an absolutely remarkable story and</v>

73
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:57.920
<v Speaker 1>no one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

74
00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what percentage of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>would know his name,</v>

75
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.140
<v Speaker 1>his name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't imagine it's.</v>

76
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.100
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suspect it's in the low percentages if</v>

77
00:04:06.101 --> 00:04:06.934
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

78
00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.790
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

79
00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there may have been a change.</v>

80
00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:14.440
<v Speaker 2>I seem to recall a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although I hate to begin any sentence</v>

81
00:04:14.441 --> 00:04:18.480
<v Speaker 2>with when I was young a day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we,</v>

82
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.760
<v Speaker 2>we did read heroic biographies of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Medical Pioneers like annotating the</v>

83
00:04:24.761 --> 00:04:28.570
<v Speaker 2>discover of sewage and that Thomas</v>
<v Speaker 2>Edison,</v>

84
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.840
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know if that kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>heroic biography of the innovator of the</v>

85
00:04:34.251 --> 00:04:38.200
<v Speaker 2>inventor a scientist is as common at</v>
<v Speaker 2>children's education.</v>

86
00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:39.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suspect,</v>

87
00:04:39.591 --> 00:04:42.860
<v Speaker 1>I strongly suspect not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It certainly wouldn't be in Canada given</v>

88
00:04:42.861 --> 00:04:45.140
<v Speaker 1>the tilt that our education system has</v>
<v Speaker 1>taken.</v>
