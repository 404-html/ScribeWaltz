1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you guys know about the,</v>

2
00:00:02.161 --> 00:00:02.994
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.780
<v Speaker 1>the daycare scandals that,</v>

4
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:07.621
<v Speaker 1>that were very,</v>

5
00:00:07.621 --> 00:00:12.090
<v Speaker 1>very common in the 1980s so horribly common,</v>

6
00:00:12.091 --> 00:00:13.710
<v Speaker 1>actually this infested many towns.</v>

7
00:00:13.711 --> 00:00:17.550
<v Speaker 1>And usually what would happen is somebody who is a little on the paranoid side</v>

8
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.600
<v Speaker 1>or maybe a lot of on the paranoid side would send their children off to daycare.</v>

9
00:00:21.601 --> 00:00:23.130
<v Speaker 1>And that was a whole new thing in the 80s,</v>

10
00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:23.341
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

11
00:00:23.341 --> 00:00:24.174
<v Speaker 1>Because women were,</v>

12
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.571
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:24.571 --> 00:00:28.050
<v Speaker 1>moving into the workforce like mad and so they were handing over there often</v>

14
00:00:28.051 --> 00:00:31.410
<v Speaker 1>their infants kids below three say two total strangers.</v>

15
00:00:31.411 --> 00:00:32.070
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

16
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.320
<v Speaker 1>for some of them that set up a fair bit of worry.</v>

17
00:00:34.321 --> 00:00:35.250
<v Speaker 1>Like it still does.</v>

18
00:00:35.251 --> 00:00:37.080
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes that word got out of hand,</v>

19
00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:40.290
<v Speaker 1>especially among the people who are a little on the little predisposed to</v>

20
00:00:40.291 --> 00:00:41.490
<v Speaker 1>paranoid schizophrenia.</v>

21
00:00:41.491 --> 00:00:44.430
<v Speaker 1>And maybe even had had some previous episodes.</v>

22
00:00:44.431 --> 00:00:45.090
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

23
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.421
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:00:45.421 --> 00:00:49.740
<v Speaker 1>the kid would come home and the mother would observe or not something kind of</v>

25
00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:51.300
<v Speaker 1>peculiar about their behavior.</v>

26
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.790
<v Speaker 1>And then she'd fantasize about maybe what that was.</v>

27
00:00:53.791 --> 00:00:54.460
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

28
00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.440
<v Speaker 1>she started asking the child if the child had been touched in any particular way</v>

30
00:00:58.441 --> 00:00:59.370
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

31
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.800
<v Speaker 1>and she keep this up for a good length of time.</v>

32
00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:05.550
<v Speaker 1>And then the child would start to have nightmares and then the child would tell</v>

33
00:01:05.551 --> 00:01:08.760
<v Speaker 1>the mother about what the nightmares were and then that would freak her out.</v>

34
00:01:08.761 --> 00:01:11.040
<v Speaker 1>And so she'd ask even deeper questions and soon,</v>

35
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.970
<v Speaker 1>her children were telling her that horrible things were happening to them at</v>

37
00:01:14.971 --> 00:01:15.780
<v Speaker 1>daycare.</v>

38
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.930
<v Speaker 1>And so then she'd go to the police and they wouldn't look into recycling Patrick</v>

39
00:01:18.931 --> 00:01:19.764
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>

40
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.980
<v Speaker 1>And then the police would go out and they'd start to interview other children.</v>

41
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.020
<v Speaker 1>And if they interviewed them properly,</v>

42
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.860
<v Speaker 1>then the other children would start to produce all these stories as well because</v>

43
00:01:28.861 --> 00:01:30.570
<v Speaker 1>the now how did that happen?</v>

44
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

45
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.160
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of ways.</v>

46
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.993
<v Speaker 1>The first is</v>

47
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.240
<v Speaker 1>the police would ask leading questions like,</v>

48
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.010
<v Speaker 1>did anyone touch you?</v>

49
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.933
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

50
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.620
<v Speaker 1>of course I'm going to touch the cans.</v>

51
00:01:43.621 --> 00:01:43.921
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

52
00:01:43.921 --> 00:01:44.880
<v Speaker 1>people touch kids.</v>

53
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.980
<v Speaker 1>Did anybody touch you there?</v>

54
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

55
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.110
<v Speaker 1>that's not a question.</v>

56
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.300
<v Speaker 1>That's a piece of information.</v>

57
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.570
<v Speaker 1>The piece of information is if someone touched me there and adult would be very</v>

58
00:01:57.091 --> 00:01:58.440
<v Speaker 1>interested in that,</v>

59
00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:59.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

60
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:00.150
<v Speaker 1>So what now,</v>

61
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.820
<v Speaker 1>what's a child doing when he's answering and adults questions?</v>

62
00:02:02.821 --> 00:02:05.370
<v Speaker 1>Wealth child doesn't bloody well know what the hell do they know?</v>

63
00:02:05.371 --> 00:02:06.360
<v Speaker 1>They're like three.</v>

64
00:02:06.361 --> 00:02:07.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

65
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.270
<v Speaker 1>they can't hardly organize their story.</v>

66
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.841
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

67
00:02:09.841 --> 00:02:11.760
<v Speaker 1>if you're talking to a kid and you want to give,</v>

68
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.160
<v Speaker 1>get them to give you an account of their day,</v>

69
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.570
<v Speaker 1>you have to really guide them through the Organization of their memory.</v>

70
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.750
<v Speaker 1>And partly what they're doing when you're doing that is they're looking at you</v>

71
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.500
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out if they're telling you the right things,</v>

72
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.880
<v Speaker 1>which is what they should be doing.</v>

73
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.630
<v Speaker 1>Because what they're trying to learn to do is to tell people things in a way</v>

74
00:02:30.631 --> 00:02:31.710
<v Speaker 1>that they'll understand them.</v>

75
00:02:31.711 --> 00:02:33.030
<v Speaker 1>But that makes the child very,</v>

76
00:02:33.031 --> 00:02:37.650
<v Speaker 1>very responsive to the nonverbal and verbal cues of the adult.</v>

77
00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.010
<v Speaker 1>You think about how fast those little rats learn how to pick up language.</v>

78
00:02:41.011 --> 00:02:41.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

79
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.130
<v Speaker 1>it's really very fast and no one really teaches them.</v>

80
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.080
<v Speaker 1>They're just paying attention like mad.</v>

81
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.610
<v Speaker 1>So you get a bunch of cops who were on how like a half cocked adventure and they</v>

82
00:02:50.611 --> 00:02:54.750
<v Speaker 1>think there's some serial sexual pervert in their midst and they go interview,</v>

83
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:55.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

84
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.650
<v Speaker 1>1520 kids and they do do,</v>

85
00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:58.140
<v Speaker 1>do it,</v>

86
00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.910
<v Speaker 1>do it a lot.</v>

87
00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.230
<v Speaker 1>They use the little dolls and they do it a lot and they do it a lot and they do</v>

88
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.970
<v Speaker 1>a lot and sooner or later all the kids start having nightmares and then they</v>

89
00:03:06.971 --> 00:03:07.960
<v Speaker 1>start telling the carbs.</v>

90
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.910
<v Speaker 1>There's all these terrible things happen,</v>

91
00:03:09.911 --> 00:03:13.090
<v Speaker 1>like they're taking into underground caverns and they're stripped naked and</v>

92
00:03:13.091 --> 00:03:17.650
<v Speaker 1>they're forced to like leap frog over each other and like you just can't believe</v>

93
00:03:17.651 --> 00:03:17.771
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

94
00:03:17.771 --> 00:03:18.341
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

95
00:03:18.341 --> 00:03:19.190
<v Speaker 1>You can't believe it.</v>

96
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.000
<v Speaker 1>It's all documented in a book called Satan's silence,</v>

97
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.280
<v Speaker 1>which was written by a social worker and a lawyer.</v>

98
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.810
<v Speaker 1>It's mind boggling.</v>

99
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.170
<v Speaker 1>The longest prison sentence is in American history were handed out to it to a</v>

100
00:03:31.241 --> 00:03:36.241
<v Speaker 1>series of middle aged women who are taking care of little kids and the FBI even</v>

101
00:03:36.281 --> 00:03:38.290
<v Speaker 1>came up with a whole new criminal category,</v>

102
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.970
<v Speaker 1>late onset,</v>

103
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.890
<v Speaker 1>female sexual offender.</v>

104
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.401
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

105
00:03:42.401 --> 00:03:44.500
<v Speaker 1>why didn't that category exist before?</v>

106
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:45.730
<v Speaker 1>It's simple.</v>

107
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.740
<v Speaker 1>There are no late onset,</v>

108
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.110
<v Speaker 1>middle aged female sexual offenders.</v>

109
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.150
<v Speaker 1>That's why we didn't need the category.</v>

110
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.400
<v Speaker 1>But once all these accusations came up,</v>

111
00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:55.061
<v Speaker 1>well poof,</v>

112
00:03:55.061 --> 00:03:55.301
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

113
00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:57.610
<v Speaker 1>you had to have some damn category for these poor women.</v>

114
00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.000
<v Speaker 1>Some of them were put in jail for 350 years,</v>

115
00:04:01.001 --> 00:04:04.780
<v Speaker 1>which seems a bit excessive given that they're only going to last about 40,</v>

116
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:05.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

117
00:04:05.231 --> 00:04:08.080
<v Speaker 1>they get 12 consecutive life sentences.</v>

118
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.800
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>

119
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.341
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

120
00:04:09.341 --> 00:04:14.341
<v Speaker 1>there was actually a situation where one town went so far as to start digging</v>

121
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.370
<v Speaker 1>underneath the town to find these underground,</v>

122
00:04:18.371 --> 00:04:22.090
<v Speaker 1>say tannic layers where all these weird ritual things were going on,</v>

123
00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.751
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

124
00:04:22.751 --> 00:04:27.751
<v Speaker 1>and along with this was not one shred of Collab of concrete evidence,</v>

125
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.421
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

126
00:04:28.421 --> 00:04:32.710
<v Speaker 1>on the eventual conclusions and disaffected thousands of people.</v>

127
00:04:32.711 --> 00:04:34.240
<v Speaker 1>The eventual conclusions was,</v>

128
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.991
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

129
00:04:34.991 --> 00:04:35.270
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

130
00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.030
<v Speaker 1>there actually isn't anybody who's,</v>

131
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

132
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.010
<v Speaker 1>saint technically,</v>

133
00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

134
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.010
<v Speaker 1>torturing children in daycare centers.</v>
