00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:07.990
<v Speaker 1>A Washington Post article,</v>

2
00:00:07.991 --> 00:00:09.850
<v Speaker 1>November,</v>

3
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.850
<v Speaker 1>2016 and it said out of the 700 counties in Pennsylvania,</v>

4
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.640
<v Speaker 1>Ohio,</v>

5
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:18.783
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.090
<v Speaker 1>Wisconsin that voted for Obama twice,</v>

7
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.910
<v Speaker 1>predominantly white counties,</v>

8
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.080
<v Speaker 1>a third of them flipped and voted for president Trump.</v>

9
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:34.290
<v Speaker 1>So the racism argument just doesn't wash because if you vote in a black man</v>

10
00:00:34.331 --> 00:00:36.160
<v Speaker 1>twice for president,</v>

11
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:37.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.990
<v Speaker 1>especially in Ohio,</v>

13
00:00:37.991 --> 00:00:40.150
<v Speaker 1>I think where there was 37 counties that voted,</v>

14
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:40.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

15
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:41.860
<v Speaker 1>predominantly white,</v>

16
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.330
<v Speaker 1>predominantly white,</v>

17
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.880
<v Speaker 1>that voted President Obama in twice.</v>

18
00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.010
<v Speaker 1>And then they flipped and turned to Ohio.</v>

19
00:00:48.011 --> 00:00:51.280
<v Speaker 1>And I've been raising the red flag on this for a long time.</v>

20
00:00:51.281 --> 00:00:54.970
<v Speaker 1>I've been saying to people that I really believe that president Trump's victory,</v>

21
00:00:54.971 --> 00:00:56.500
<v Speaker 1>he's ill equipped to be president.</v>

22
00:00:56.501 --> 00:00:57.300
<v Speaker 1>We all know that.</v>

23
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.300
<v Speaker 1>He has no clue what he's doing was an absolute a signal that the regressive</v>

24
00:01:05.471 --> 00:01:05.811
<v Speaker 1>left.</v>

25
00:01:05.811 --> 00:01:10.540
<v Speaker 1>This had driven people crazy and insane and they were frustrated and fed up,</v>

26
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

27
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:12.970
<v Speaker 1>for being called bigoted.</v>

28
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.390
<v Speaker 1>They were sick of being talked down to and then</v>

29
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.270
<v Speaker 2>still being talked down to like the,</v>

30
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.050
<v Speaker 2>the classic response of the mainstream media to,</v>

31
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.670
<v Speaker 2>to the existence of Trump is to basically assume 50% of the American electorate</v>

32
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.420
<v Speaker 2>are stupid racist bigots.</v>

33
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.300
<v Speaker 1>Like Hillary called them deplorables.</v>

34
00:01:32.301 --> 00:01:33.830
<v Speaker 1>The basket of deplorables.</v>

35
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:34.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

36
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.450
<v Speaker 1>But you know what,</v>

37
00:01:35.451 --> 00:01:38.660
<v Speaker 1>I've been actually kind of looking at what the grievances are and what the</v>

38
00:01:38.661 --> 00:01:42.030
<v Speaker 1>concerns are and do you sound like really decent people to me would,</v>

39
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.080
<v Speaker 1>they're asking real questions about unvetted immigration,</v>

40
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.510
<v Speaker 1>large amounts of immigration to the country,</v>

41
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.220
<v Speaker 1>border security,</v>

42
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

43
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.740
<v Speaker 1>millions of illegal immigrants.</v>

44
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.510
<v Speaker 1>They're asking very real questions that would concern anybody and for that</v>

45
00:01:56.511 --> 00:01:58.550
<v Speaker 1>they're being labeled bigoted and racist.</v>

46
00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

47
00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.710
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

48
00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:00.580
<v Speaker 2>Well it is in it.</v>

49
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.030
<v Speaker 2>That's the sort of thing that's driving this dangerous polarization and it's,</v>

50
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.923
<v Speaker 2>it's really,</v>

51
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.520
<v Speaker 2>it's really unfortunate.</v>

52
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.863
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

53
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.590
<v Speaker 1>And my concern is,</v>

54
00:02:09.591 --> 00:02:14.591
<v Speaker 1>and my concern ever since Trump has been elected is that we're going to create a</v>

55
00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:18.980
<v Speaker 1>toxic environment in Canada because from the universities and colleges we can</v>

56
00:02:18.981 --> 00:02:23.540
<v Speaker 1>already see it's there that we are going to drive people in Canada to very</v>

57
00:02:23.541 --> 00:02:25.310
<v Speaker 1>radical fringe positions.</v>

58
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:26.570
<v Speaker 1>And that's my worry.</v>

59
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.951
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

60
00:02:26.951 --> 00:02:30.340
<v Speaker 2>if we elect wouldn't again then we'll certainly be well on the road to doing</v>

61
00:02:30.341 --> 00:02:30.551
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

62
00:02:30.551 --> 00:02:34.270
<v Speaker 2>And I also think that the Trudeau government is far to the left of where people</v>

63
00:02:34.271 --> 00:02:35.740
<v Speaker 2>originally assumed it would be.</v>

64
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.551
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

65
00:02:36.551 --> 00:02:41.551
<v Speaker 2>I think that his decision to put 50% women in the cabinet was an abdication of</v>

66
00:02:42.161 --> 00:02:44.260
<v Speaker 2>responsibility on the magnitude that,</v>

67
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.560
<v Speaker 2>that we haven't seen before in Canadian political history.</v>

68
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.770
<v Speaker 2>Only 26% of the of the MPs elected were female and that should have been</v>

69
00:02:52.961 --> 00:02:55.330
<v Speaker 2>approximately the proportion of cabinet members.</v>

70
00:02:55.331 --> 00:02:59.110
<v Speaker 2>But to say this is 2015 or whatever the hell the year.</v>

71
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.670
<v Speaker 2>And then to abdicate his responsibility for selecting the most competent people</v>

72
00:03:03.671 --> 00:03:07.000
<v Speaker 2>was an an indication of exactly how,</v>

73
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

74
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.460
<v Speaker 2>what would you say how suited he is to be prime minister and people just didn't</v>

75
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:16.090
<v Speaker 2>make much of an issue of that because of their attempts to be tolerant.</v>

76
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.960
<v Speaker 2>But I think that what he did was re,</v>

77
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.461
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

78
00:03:18.461 --> 00:03:22.540
<v Speaker 2>I thought the fact that he ran to begin with was reprehensible because he ran</v>

79
00:03:22.541 --> 00:03:27.010
<v Speaker 2>entirely on the name brand recognition that he had derived from his father.</v>

80
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.760
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's the mark of someone who's narcissistic.</v>

81
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.430
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't have done that</v>

82
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.860
<v Speaker 2>for him.</v>

83
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.540
<v Speaker 2>Very charismatic and attractive,</v>

84
00:03:37.541 --> 00:03:39.130
<v Speaker 2>and he knows how to behave in public.</v>

85
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.140
<v Speaker 2>And so Andy had a very,</v>

86
00:03:41.141 --> 00:03:42.850
<v Speaker 2>very famous name and,</v>

87
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.650
<v Speaker 2>but I believe that it was immoral of him to run because the,</v>

88
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.090
<v Speaker 2>we're not dynasties,</v>

89
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.770
<v Speaker 2>democracies aren't dynasties,</v>

90
00:03:50.771 --> 00:03:52.540
<v Speaker 2>and he hadn't the,</v>

91
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.973
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

92
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.271
<v Speaker 2>the CV,</v>

93
00:03:55.271 --> 00:03:55.900
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

94
00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.370
<v Speaker 2>the record of success that you would need as an independent individual to</v>

95
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.400
<v Speaker 2>justify himself as a qualified candidate for prime minister.</v>

96
00:04:04.401 --> 00:04:09.190
<v Speaker 2>So I thought that is his candidacy right from the start was ethically flawed</v>

97
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:10.533
<v Speaker 2>then to,</v>

98
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.800
<v Speaker 2>to multiply that error with these,</v>

99
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.903
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

100
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:17.103
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

101
00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

102
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.860
<v Speaker 2>shallow attempts at broadcasting tolerance,</v>

103
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.750
<v Speaker 2>especially at the expense of competence and the capacity to truly evaluate is</v>

104
00:04:25.751 --> 00:04:28.300
<v Speaker 2>just inexcusable.</v>

105
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:29.380
<v Speaker 2>Inexcusable.</v>
