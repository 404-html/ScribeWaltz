00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.500
<v Speaker 1>The fundamental story of genesis is something like this.</v>

2
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:11.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.860
<v Speaker 1>and it's perhaps the most brilliant contribution of Judeo Christian thought to</v>

4
00:00:15.861 --> 00:00:16.730
<v Speaker 1>world history.</v>

5
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.953
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

6
00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.440
<v Speaker 1>it's total impact is virtually in calculable.</v>

7
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.050
<v Speaker 1>The idea is this,</v>

8
00:00:24.051 --> 00:00:28.190
<v Speaker 1>that chaos can be conceptualized as something that has an essentially feminine</v>

9
00:00:28.191 --> 00:00:32.540
<v Speaker 1>aspect as a matrix and a matrix is a structure from which other structures</v>

10
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.340
<v Speaker 1>emerge and the story of genesis makes the hypothesis that logos,</v>

11
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.780
<v Speaker 1>which is the word of God,</v>

12
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.500
<v Speaker 1>a phenomenon associated with speech and communication and logic,</v>

13
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.620
<v Speaker 1>logos,</v>

14
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.453
<v Speaker 1>logic,</v>

15
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.750
<v Speaker 1>rationality,</v>

16
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:49.430
<v Speaker 1>courage,</v>

17
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:50.450
<v Speaker 1>exploration,</v>

18
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.830
<v Speaker 1>all combined into a single entity or trait logos.</v>

19
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.100
<v Speaker 1>The combination of logos and chaos is what brings order into being.</v>

20
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.170
<v Speaker 1>That's what the story in genesis means.</v>

21
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.540
<v Speaker 1>It's not a empirical description of the origin of objects.</v>

22
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.320
<v Speaker 1>It's a phenomenological description of the origin of experience.</v>

23
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.680
<v Speaker 1>The idea of being that without the piercing glance of whatever consciousness is,</v>

24
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.820
<v Speaker 1>whatever the background of experience is,</v>

25
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.590
<v Speaker 1>the matrix chaos cannot be conceptualized as real.</v>

26
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.400
<v Speaker 1>It takes the interplay between the feminine principle chaos and the masculine</v>

27
00:01:28.401 --> 00:01:31.520
<v Speaker 1>principle logos in order to produce being</v>

28
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.550
<v Speaker 1>now thoughts of substantial importance when you give some consideration to the</v>

29
00:01:37.551 --> 00:01:39.710
<v Speaker 1>fact that immediately in genesis,</v>

30
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.700
<v Speaker 1>after the establishment of livable order,</v>

31
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.510
<v Speaker 1>the day of the Yahuah identifies as the individual human being with logos,</v>

32
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.280
<v Speaker 1>right made in God's image.</v>

33
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.860
<v Speaker 1>That's the essential characteristic of the human being.</v>

34
00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.630
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that the logos that operates in human beings,</v>

35
00:02:00.631 --> 00:02:03.180
<v Speaker 1>which is this capacity to make order out of chaos,</v>

36
00:02:03.181 --> 00:02:07.230
<v Speaker 1>is identical to the principal that gives rise to the cosmos from a mythological</v>

37
00:02:07.231 --> 00:02:08.064
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

38
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.840
<v Speaker 1>So it partakes of the day.</v>

39
00:02:09.841 --> 00:02:10.080
<v Speaker 1>Eddie,</v>

40
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.080
<v Speaker 1>in a very direct sense in so far as being itself is dependent on its operation.</v>

41
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.150
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

42
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.790
<v Speaker 1>Now it's still possible to claim,</v>

43
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.150
<v Speaker 1>given that perspective that a story with that sort of structure is superstitious</v>

44
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.470
<v Speaker 1>and then it doesn't bear any relationship to what actually constitutes reality.</v>

45
00:02:31.471 --> 00:02:34.950
<v Speaker 1>But you have to understand that that story old as it is,</v>

46
00:02:34.951 --> 00:02:39.951
<v Speaker 1>it's predicated on older stories and it's on the ground that those older stories</v>

47
00:02:40.051 --> 00:02:43.500
<v Speaker 1>established that our entire concept of natural rights rests.</v>

48
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.950
<v Speaker 1>So if you believe that natural rights have an existence that's more than merely</v>

49
00:02:49.171 --> 00:02:50.004
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary,</v>

50
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.920
<v Speaker 1>the reason you believe that is because they're predicate.</v>

51
00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.920
<v Speaker 1>Those rights are predicated on the ideas that are expressed in these myths.</v>
