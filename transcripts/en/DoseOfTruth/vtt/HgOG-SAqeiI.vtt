00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.830
<v Speaker 1>Here's a good one self that's in Saint Peter's.</v>

2
00:00:09.831 --> 00:00:14.831
<v Speaker 1>And I really liked this one because you can see the echoes of Jacob's vision for</v>

3
00:00:17.571 --> 00:00:19.280
<v Speaker 1>the establishment of a territory there,</v>

4
00:00:19.281 --> 00:00:19.491
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5
00:00:19.491 --> 00:00:23.000
<v Speaker 1>You've got the obelisk in the middle and then you've got the directions</v>

6
00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:24.770
<v Speaker 1>radiating from the center.</v>

7
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.930
<v Speaker 1>And of course Saint Peters,</v>

8
00:00:26.931 --> 00:00:29.600
<v Speaker 1>this is St Peter's Basilica in Rome,</v>

9
00:00:29.601 --> 00:00:32.210
<v Speaker 1>which is an absolutely unbelievable place.</v>

10
00:00:32.211 --> 00:00:33.830
<v Speaker 1>It's just jaw dropping.</v>

11
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.230
<v Speaker 1>And so there's the cathedral at the back of it and then there's this circle of</v>

12
00:00:39.231 --> 00:00:40.670
<v Speaker 1>pillars that surrounds it.</v>

13
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.500
<v Speaker 1>You can just see them a little bit on the,</v>

14
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.960
<v Speaker 1>on the middle left there.</v>

15
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.750
<v Speaker 1>That goes all the way around that entire enclosure.</v>

16
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.033
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

17
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.611
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

18
00:00:49.611 --> 00:00:51.680
<v Speaker 1>very large number of people can gather there.</v>

19
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.113
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

20
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.140
<v Speaker 1>so that pillar marks the center and that'd be the center of Catholicism</v>

21
00:00:57.141 --> 00:00:57.681
<v Speaker 1>essentially.</v>

22
00:00:57.681 --> 00:00:58.940
<v Speaker 1>That's what that represents,</v>

23
00:00:58.941 --> 00:00:59.171
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

24
00:00:59.171 --> 00:00:59.600
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

25
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.610
<v Speaker 1>the symbolic center of Catholicism.</v>

26
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.730
<v Speaker 1>Although you could make the case that the cathedral is the center,</v>

27
00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:05.541
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really matter.</v>

28
00:01:05.541 --> 00:01:07.550
<v Speaker 1>They're very close together and it's,</v>

29
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.040
<v Speaker 1>it's half a dozen of one and six or the other.</v>

30
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.300
<v Speaker 1>And then here's another representation of the same idea,</v>

31
00:01:14.301 --> 00:01:14.571
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

32
00:01:14.571 --> 00:01:17.810
<v Speaker 1>Is that this is why people don't like the flag to be burned,</v>

33
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.471
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:01:18.471 --> 00:01:23.210
<v Speaker 1>because conservative people see the flag as the sacred thing that binds people</v>

35
00:01:23.211 --> 00:01:24.044
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

36
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.010
<v Speaker 1>And so they're not happy when that sacred thing is destroyed,</v>

37
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.410
<v Speaker 1>even if it's destroyed in the name of protest.</v>

38
00:01:30.411 --> 00:01:32.030
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the people who burn flags think,</v>

39
00:01:32.031 --> 00:01:32.211
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

40
00:01:32.211 --> 00:01:37.211
<v Speaker 1>there are times to dramatize the idea that the center has been corrupt and you</v>

41
00:01:37.551 --> 00:01:42.350
<v Speaker 1>can demonstrate that by putting it to the torch in who has a representation</v>

42
00:01:42.351 --> 00:01:43.184
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

43
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.210
<v Speaker 1>that this,</v>

44
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.210
<v Speaker 1>that the corrupt center now has to be burned and transformed.</v>

45
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.650
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is they're both right.</v>

46
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.640
<v Speaker 1>They're both right all the time because the center is absolutely necessary and</v>

47
00:01:55.641 --> 00:02:00.641
<v Speaker 1>is sacred and is almost always also corrupt and in need of reparation.</v>

48
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.810
<v Speaker 1>That's also an archetipal idea.</v>

49
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.711
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

50
00:02:03.711 --> 00:02:05.600
<v Speaker 1>and that's a useful thing to know because you know,</v>

51
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.900
<v Speaker 1>it's easy for young people in particular to think that,</v>

52
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.831
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

53
00:02:09.831 --> 00:02:13.820
<v Speaker 1>the world's going to hell in a handbasket and it's the fault of the last</v>

54
00:02:13.821 --> 00:02:14.451
<v Speaker 1>generation.</v>

55
00:02:14.451 --> 00:02:16.040
<v Speaker 1>They've left us this terrible mass.</v>

56
00:02:16.041 --> 00:02:16.731
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

57
00:02:16.731 --> 00:02:18.620
<v Speaker 1>we've feeling pretty betrayed about that.</v>

58
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.880
<v Speaker 1>Now we have to clean it up.</v>

59
00:02:19.881 --> 00:02:20.241
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

60
00:02:20.241 --> 00:02:20.421
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

61
00:02:20.421 --> 00:02:20.691
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

62
00:02:20.691 --> 00:02:23.930
<v Speaker 1>People have been thinking that for like 35,000 years.</v>

63
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.160
<v Speaker 1>It's not new.</v>

64
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.630
<v Speaker 1>And the reason it's not new,</v>

65
00:02:26.631 --> 00:02:27.980
<v Speaker 1>it's cause it's always true.</v>

66
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.390
<v Speaker 1>You know what you're handed is a sacred center with flaws.</v>

67
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:33.111
<v Speaker 1>Always.</v>

68
00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:33.944
<v Speaker 1>Always.</v>

69
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.500
<v Speaker 1>And it's partly because it's the creation of the dead,</v>

70
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:37.880
<v Speaker 1>right in the dead.</v>

71
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:38.571
<v Speaker 1>Can't see,</v>

72
00:02:38.571 --> 00:02:39.680
<v Speaker 1>and they can't communicate.</v>

73
00:02:39.681 --> 00:02:41.600
<v Speaker 1>And so they're not in touch with the present.</v>

74
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.760
<v Speaker 1>And so what they've bequeath to you,</v>

75
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.610
<v Speaker 1>apart from the fact that it might actually be corrupt,</v>

76
00:02:46.611 --> 00:02:47.930
<v Speaker 1>which is a slightly different thing,</v>

77
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.150
<v Speaker 1>is it least blind in dead.</v>

78
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.630
<v Speaker 1>And so what the hell can you expect from something that's blind and dead?</v>

79
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.231
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

80
00:02:54.231 --> 00:02:56.870
<v Speaker 1>you're lucky if it just doesn't stomp you out of existence.</v>
