2
00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.670
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] just turn around and</v>

3
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.350
<v Speaker 1>you're all ready to go.</v>

4
00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:04.620
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

5
00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:05.420
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

6
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.070
<v Speaker 1>Next two minutes we'll start</v>

7
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:22.483
<v Speaker 1>off</v>

8
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.300
<v Speaker 1>by</v>

9
00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.560
<v Speaker 1>the presence of the free speech busters</v>

10
00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.540
<v Speaker 1>activism and advocacy on campus.</v>

11
00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:41.820
<v Speaker 1>Know he was thrust into the spotlight a couple years ago</v>

12
00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.390
<v Speaker 1>and since then</v>

13
00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:53.303
<v Speaker 1>she</v>

14
00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:58.013
<v Speaker 1>leaves</v>

15
00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.353
<v Speaker 1>the</v>

16
00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.093
<v Speaker 1>stage</v>

17
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:25.270
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

18
00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:58.643
<v Speaker 2>thank you very much.</v>

19
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:10.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get right into it.</v>

20
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:13.190
<v Speaker 2>I signed those costs.</v>

21
00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.740
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

22
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:37.310
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] so I'm going to walk through my talk.</v>

23
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:49.510
<v Speaker 2>I'll see if I can touch on it probably won't happen cause I usually get</v>

24
00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.010
<v Speaker 2>partway through</v>

25
00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:57.930
<v Speaker 2>and I'll start with rule one</v>

26
00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:01.680
<v Speaker 2>which is stand up straight and your shoulders back.</v>

27
00:10:01.681 --> 00:10:06.681
<v Speaker 2>And I'm actually just start by talking about a different book in the last couple</v>

28
00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:11.190
<v Speaker 2>of weeks by Walter shy daily as degree level.</v>

29
00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.290
<v Speaker 2>I would really recommend this book by the way,</v>

30
00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:15.133
<v Speaker 2>Mine,</v>

31
00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:16.620
<v Speaker 2>I can recommend another one.</v>

32
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:23.720
<v Speaker 2>The reason I bought this book was because I had this client in my clinical</v>

33
00:10:23.821 --> 00:10:24.211
<v Speaker 2>practice.</v>

34
00:10:24.211 --> 00:10:25.440
<v Speaker 2>He was a fascinating guy.</v>

35
00:10:25.441 --> 00:10:30.240
<v Speaker 2>He's an old guy and he comes to me because he was thinking you're obsessed with</v>

36
00:10:30.241 --> 00:10:30.861
<v Speaker 2>mathematics,</v>

37
00:10:30.861 --> 00:10:32.090
<v Speaker 2>that you couldn't get it out of his mind.</v>

38
00:10:32.091 --> 00:10:34.380
<v Speaker 2>And he had some other issues as well.</v>

39
00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:35.363
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

40
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:35.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

41
00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.170
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of interesting things.</v>

42
00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:41.310
<v Speaker 2>He made these little gold pennies out of the world's most beautiful equation</v>

43
00:10:41.311 --> 00:10:42.144
<v Speaker 2>that needs to happen.</v>

44
00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:44.140
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

45
00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:47.070
<v Speaker 2>and he had studied psychology and he was studying finance.</v>

46
00:10:47.071 --> 00:10:48.210
<v Speaker 2>And I learned,</v>

47
00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:53.300
<v Speaker 2>I think I learned more from him in my dealings with him in the therapeutic</v>

48
00:10:53.461 --> 00:10:55.440
<v Speaker 2>context that he learned from me.</v>

49
00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:58.280
<v Speaker 2>That's not that rare if you're clinical psychologist,</v>

50
00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:00.123
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

51
00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:03.930
<v Speaker 2>if you're talking to people need to leave the probability that you're going to</v>

52
00:11:03.931 --> 00:11:05.830
<v Speaker 2>learn something from an unbelievable.</v>

53
00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:11.220
<v Speaker 2>And so I think probably if you're not learning something from the clients every</v>

54
00:11:11.221 --> 00:11:12.210
<v Speaker 2>time we talk to them,</v>

55
00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:16.830
<v Speaker 2>then you're probably not on the right track from a therapeutic perspective.</v>

56
00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:22.460
<v Speaker 2>And I kind of alluded to that in rural rule nine,</v>

57
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:25.440
<v Speaker 2>which is assumed that the person that you're listening to know something you</v>

58
00:11:25.441 --> 00:11:25.801
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

59
00:11:25.801 --> 00:11:26.910
<v Speaker 2>which is a very good rule.</v>

60
00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:28.050
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

61
00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:32.010
<v Speaker 2>he introduced me to this thing I've talked about an awful lot,</v>

62
00:11:32.011 --> 00:11:36.230
<v Speaker 2>which was a principal derived choir telling economists can feel afraid of</v>

63
00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:36.781
<v Speaker 2>Horatio.</v>

64
00:11:36.781 --> 00:11:41.781
<v Speaker 2>And Creator was the person who formulated the Credo principle,</v>

65
00:11:42.211 --> 00:11:43.980
<v Speaker 2>which is that it's a very,</v>

66
00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:45.540
<v Speaker 2>it's a very terrible principal,</v>

67
00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:51.010
<v Speaker 2>the principal about tough cause you have 10 employees,</v>

68
00:11:51.011 --> 00:11:53.760
<v Speaker 2>ten three of them do have to work with principal.</v>

69
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:54.633
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentally,</v>

70
00:11:55.060 --> 00:12:00.060
<v Speaker 3>the square root reason will seems to apply every single domain where there's</v>

71
00:12:00.251 --> 00:12:03.020
<v Speaker 3>creative variability in human endeavor,</v>

72
00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:07.090
<v Speaker 3>but also seems also to apply to domains outside of human endeavor.</v>

73
00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:12.150
<v Speaker 3>And even even living in general together can applies to the occupation of cities</v>

74
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.350
<v Speaker 3>and the massive stars for example,</v>

75
00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:19.720
<v Speaker 3>which means it seems to make it a principle that goes beyond well,</v>

76
00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.750
<v Speaker 3>certainly be on the sociological beyond the biological.</v>

77
00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.490
<v Speaker 3>It's grounded deeply into the,</v>

78
00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:26.080
<v Speaker 3>into the physical.</v>

79
00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:27.870
<v Speaker 3>And anyways,</v>

80
00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:29.590
<v Speaker 3>the square root dog goes something like this.</v>

81
00:12:29.591 --> 00:12:33.400
<v Speaker 3>So the square root of the number of people in a given domain who half the</v>

82
00:12:33.401 --> 00:12:34.234
<v Speaker 3>productive work.</v>

83
00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:38.450
<v Speaker 3>And so our Repatha Repatha think,</v>

84
00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:39.100
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

85
00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:39.371
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

86
00:12:39.371 --> 00:12:40.300
<v Speaker 3>if you have 10 employees,</v>

87
00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:41.121
<v Speaker 3>then three of them who have,</v>

88
00:12:41.121 --> 00:12:41.770
<v Speaker 3>who works,</v>

89
00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:42.790
<v Speaker 3>that's not that surprising.</v>

90
00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:43.930
<v Speaker 3>You have 10 employees.</v>

91
00:12:43.931 --> 00:12:46.130
<v Speaker 3>One of them is probably not doing that well.</v>

92
00:12:46.131 --> 00:12:47.500
<v Speaker 3>And now the two are sort of,</v>

93
00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:48.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

94
00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:49.150
<v Speaker 3>dragging their feet.</v>

95
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:52.960
<v Speaker 3>Number three might be making enough money to pay their wages and then you have</v>

96
00:12:52.961 --> 00:12:53.794
<v Speaker 3>three that are</v>

97
00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:57.820
<v Speaker 3>productive enough so that they're pretty running the entire enterprise.</v>

98
00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.160
<v Speaker 3>So three out of 10 that's not too bad.</v>

99
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:05.430
<v Speaker 3>That's not that much less than 50% but if it's 10 of them do have the doctor</v>

100
00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:07.990
<v Speaker 3>Bergman thousand days,</v>

101
00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:08.691
<v Speaker 3>30 minutes,</v>

102
00:13:08.691 --> 00:13:09.461
<v Speaker 3>it's 10,000 dead.</v>

103
00:13:09.461 --> 00:13:10.294
<v Speaker 3>It's a heightened,</v>

104
00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:11.231
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's,</v>

105
00:13:11.231 --> 00:13:16.231
<v Speaker 3>so what happens is an enterprise is competence grows linearly and in competence</v>

106
00:13:18.261 --> 00:13:19.390
<v Speaker 3>grows exponentially.</v>

107
00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:21.731
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

108
00:13:21.731 --> 00:13:22.031
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

109
00:13:22.031 --> 00:13:22.864
<v Speaker 3>And this is like,</v>

110
00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.870
<v Speaker 3>you just cannot overstate the seriousness of this.</v>

111
00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:27.520
<v Speaker 3>It's absolutely,</v>

112
00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:32.440
<v Speaker 3>it's all why I think that starting tower of Babel exists in the end of the,</v>

113
00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:33.301
<v Speaker 3>of chapter one,</v>

114
00:13:33.301 --> 00:13:35.170
<v Speaker 3>that the first part of genesis,</v>

115
00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.810
<v Speaker 3>if something gets too big and will absolutely collapse,</v>

116
00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.920
<v Speaker 3>and the reason for that is that competence grows linearly,</v>

117
00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.480
<v Speaker 3>incompetence grows exponentially.</v>

118
00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:45.630
<v Speaker 3>So your member in 2008 everyone said,</v>

119
00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:46.510
<v Speaker 3>too big to fail.</v>

120
00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:47.343
<v Speaker 3>It's like no.</v>

121
00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:50.410
<v Speaker 3>So big it must fail.</v>

122
00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:54.300
<v Speaker 3>And I think this is actually a place where the right and the left could agree.</v>

123
00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.080
<v Speaker 3>If they got the owner partisan differences,</v>

124
00:13:56.081 --> 00:13:57.820
<v Speaker 3>because of course the right is very,</v>

125
00:13:57.821 --> 00:14:01.480
<v Speaker 3>very suspicious of big government and the left is very,</v>

126
00:14:01.481 --> 00:14:04.480
<v Speaker 3>very suspicious of big government and you might think,</v>

127
00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:04.870
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

128
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:05.290
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>

129
00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:07.930
<v Speaker 3>big business and you might think someone can,</v>

130
00:14:07.931 --> 00:14:09.010
<v Speaker 3>he would stand back and say,</v>

131
00:14:09.011 --> 00:14:09.410
<v Speaker 3>well look,</v>

132
00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:12.410
<v Speaker 3>the common denominator there seems to be big.</v>

133
00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:16.030
<v Speaker 3>That's very much worth 20 and up.</v>

134
00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:17.350
<v Speaker 3>Now this old guy,</v>

135
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:21.010
<v Speaker 3>he told me about the credo prints going if it solve the problem that I</v>

136
00:14:21.011 --> 00:14:22.330
<v Speaker 3>encountered in my research,</v>

137
00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:25.540
<v Speaker 3>I was doing research with Shelly Carson and Daniel Higgins.</v>

138
00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:26.530
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

139
00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:29.980
<v Speaker 3>we started this research at Harvard in the 90s and we were very interested in</v>

140
00:14:29.981 --> 00:14:33.370
<v Speaker 3>the measure of creative on creativity and creativity.</v>

141
00:14:33.371 --> 00:14:38.080
<v Speaker 3>Like many what commonly you lies descriptive terms.</v>

142
00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:41.710
<v Speaker 3>It's very difficult to nail down from a scientific perspective because to nail</v>

143
00:14:41.711 --> 00:14:43.750
<v Speaker 3>down something from a scientific perspective,</v>

144
00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:46.480
<v Speaker 3>you really have to put it in a categorical box,</v>

145
00:14:46.481 --> 00:14:46.691
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

146
00:14:46.691 --> 00:14:47.410
<v Speaker 3>You can't,</v>

147
00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:48.850
<v Speaker 3>if I use the word creativity,</v>

148
00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.950
<v Speaker 3>creativity in normal conversation,</v>

149
00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:54.350
<v Speaker 3>you can pick up what I mean from the context of the conversation.</v>

150
00:14:54.351 --> 00:14:56.630
<v Speaker 3>But if I make a measure of creativity,</v>

151
00:14:56.631 --> 00:14:57.411
<v Speaker 3>then it has to be very,</v>

152
00:14:57.411 --> 00:14:59.010
<v Speaker 3>very tightly defined.</v>

153
00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.650
<v Speaker 3>And it turns out if I'm in something like creativity,</v>

154
00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:03.200
<v Speaker 3>it's a little more difficult than you might think.</v>

155
00:15:03.201 --> 00:15:03.770
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

156
00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:05.930
<v Speaker 3>because one of the things you could say as well,</v>

157
00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:07.790
<v Speaker 3>people think creatively,</v>

158
00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:09.560
<v Speaker 3>maybe you're a creative thing.</v>

159
00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:11.120
<v Speaker 3>Is that creativity?</v>

160
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:12.111
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

161
00:15:12.111 --> 00:15:12.651
<v Speaker 3>are you ready to take?</v>

162
00:15:12.651 --> 00:15:12.771
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

163
00:15:12.771 --> 00:15:13.041
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

164
00:15:13.041 --> 00:15:14.030
<v Speaker 3>that's not enough.</v>

165
00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:17.390
<v Speaker 3>Creativity isn't merely the ability to think creatively.</v>

166
00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:22.190
<v Speaker 3>You have to produce something that's novel and useful,</v>

167
00:15:22.191 --> 00:15:22.600
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

168
00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.200
<v Speaker 3>which is a fairly common definition.</v>

169
00:15:24.201 --> 00:15:24.681
<v Speaker 3>Creative,</v>

170
00:15:24.681 --> 00:15:26.900
<v Speaker 3>creative people produce things that are novel and useful.</v>

171
00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:30.620
<v Speaker 3>There were quite a few measures of creative thinking already established in the</v>

172
00:15:30.621 --> 00:15:31.730
<v Speaker 3>psychometric literature.</v>

173
00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:37.220
<v Speaker 3>One of them is the Torrance creativity test is pretty widely used.</v>

174
00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:38.473
<v Speaker 3>It's actually a pretty,</v>

175
00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:39.570
<v Speaker 3>pretty good predictor of,</v>

176
00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:41.510
<v Speaker 3>of creative endeavor as it turns out.</v>

177
00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.430
<v Speaker 3>So with the Torrance tests,</v>

178
00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:44.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

179
00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:45.260
<v Speaker 3>you're asked for example,</v>

180
00:15:45.261 --> 00:15:48.920
<v Speaker 3>to write down as many uses as you can think of for a brick.</v>

181
00:15:48.921 --> 00:15:50.240
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's five minutes.</v>

182
00:15:50.241 --> 00:15:51.860
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember the exact amount of time.</v>

183
00:15:51.861 --> 00:15:55.280
<v Speaker 3>And then your score for absolute number of responses,</v>

184
00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:56.480
<v Speaker 3>the more the better.</v>

185
00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:58.190
<v Speaker 3>That's a straight fluency measure.</v>

186
00:15:58.191 --> 00:15:59.420
<v Speaker 3>That's called a fluency measure.</v>

187
00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:04.070
<v Speaker 3>And then the other thing that you're scored on is relative rarity of your</v>

188
00:16:04.071 --> 00:16:05.120
<v Speaker 3>response.</v>

189
00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:09.050
<v Speaker 3>As long as it still fits within the domain of both novel and useful.</v>

190
00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.930
<v Speaker 3>And so that would be creative thinking.</v>

191
00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:17.210
<v Speaker 3>Fluency measures are also visions of extraversion and trade openness from the</v>

192
00:16:17.211 --> 00:16:18.170
<v Speaker 3>big five perspective.</v>

193
00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:20.240
<v Speaker 3>And so you can tell like if you go,</v>

194
00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:21.980
<v Speaker 3>if I got all four folks,</v>

195
00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:22.940
<v Speaker 3>400 of you here,</v>

196
00:16:22.941 --> 00:16:26.810
<v Speaker 3>if I all had you write down as many words as you can that begin with the letter</v>

197
00:16:26.811 --> 00:16:28.810
<v Speaker 3>s in 90 seconds and we write orders,</v>

198
00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.380
<v Speaker 3>you buy how many words you generated,</v>

199
00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:34.790
<v Speaker 3>you get a rough rank order of your creativity as well and some estimation of</v>

200
00:16:34.791 --> 00:16:35.810
<v Speaker 3>your verbal intelligence.</v>

201
00:16:35.811 --> 00:16:37.640
<v Speaker 3>But it would be a better measure of creativity,</v>

202
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:42.380
<v Speaker 3>at least creative thinking and creative creative thinkers think laterally.</v>

203
00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:45.960
<v Speaker 3>And so what happens is you're afraid thinker is you'll have an idea and then it</v>

204
00:16:45.961 --> 00:16:47.750
<v Speaker 3>will give rise to a bunch of other ideas.</v>

205
00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:49.940
<v Speaker 3>So you have loose association networks.</v>

206
00:16:49.941 --> 00:16:51.290
<v Speaker 3>That's another way of thinking about,</v>

207
00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:51.861
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

208
00:16:51.861 --> 00:16:53.000
<v Speaker 3>someone who is not creative.</v>

209
00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:55.130
<v Speaker 3>If you've tossed them an idea,</v>

210
00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:58.250
<v Speaker 3>another idea will rapidly spring to mind.</v>

211
00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:59.330
<v Speaker 3>Or if it does,</v>

212
00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:03.050
<v Speaker 3>it'll be an idea that's quite close semantically to the original idea.</v>

213
00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:04.760
<v Speaker 3>Whereas if you're a creative person,</v>

214
00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:06.530
<v Speaker 3>you'll hit hit hidden idea,</v>

215
00:17:06.531 --> 00:17:09.680
<v Speaker 3>new junk way over here and that will remind you something way over here and</v>

216
00:17:09.681 --> 00:17:11.450
<v Speaker 3>that'll remind you of something way over here.</v>

217
00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:12.460
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

218
00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:14.630
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of creative thinking is bad thinking.</v>

219
00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:15.873
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

220
00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:18.483
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

221
00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:22.070
<v Speaker 3>it's an important thing to know if you're a creative person because it's really</v>

222
00:17:22.071 --> 00:17:23.480
<v Speaker 3>hard to monetize creativity,</v>

223
00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:23.900
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

224
00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:24.250
<v Speaker 3>If it's the,</v>

225
00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:24.621
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

226
00:17:24.621 --> 00:17:26.410
<v Speaker 3>most of your ideas are back there.</v>

227
00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:30.950
<v Speaker 3>You haven't criticized come even if they're good ideas,</v>

228
00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:34.880
<v Speaker 3>the probability that there's a market for them is quite low at that time and in</v>

229
00:17:34.881 --> 00:17:35.714
<v Speaker 3>that place.</v>

230
00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:36.231
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>

231
00:17:36.231 --> 00:17:37.760
<v Speaker 3>what do you know about marketing anyways?</v>

232
00:17:37.761 --> 00:17:39.180
<v Speaker 3>And then you have to communicate with them.</v>

233
00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:44.430
<v Speaker 3>Like it's really the pathway from creative idea to profitable creative product</v>

234
00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:49.440
<v Speaker 3>is so long that it's almost never that the originator of a creative idea</v>

235
00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:50.520
<v Speaker 3>monetize it.</v>

236
00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:54.300
<v Speaker 3>And so that's a very dismal proposition for people who are creative.</v>

237
00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:55.020
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

238
00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:58.740
<v Speaker 3>it's very like creative people generate all the new ideas.</v>

239
00:17:58.770 --> 00:17:58.981
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

240
00:17:58.981 --> 00:18:01.590
<v Speaker 3>But they hardly ever monetized other people monetize.</v>

241
00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:02.170
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

242
00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:02.581
<v Speaker 3>it's a real,</v>

243
00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:03.331
<v Speaker 3>it's a hell of a thing.</v>

244
00:18:03.331 --> 00:18:05.700
<v Speaker 3>Can be a creative person except that it's interesting.</v>

245
00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:06.670
<v Speaker 3>Anyways.</v>

246
00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:10.220
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

247
00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:13.050
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting if you'd have an interesting life if you're a creative for</v>

248
00:18:13.051 --> 00:18:13.471
<v Speaker 3>maybe two.</v>

249
00:18:13.471 --> 00:18:14.304
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>

250
00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:16.723
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

251
00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:17.131
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

252
00:18:17.131 --> 00:18:19.440
<v Speaker 3>So when we have new studied,</v>

253
00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:21.480
<v Speaker 3>so we decided to study creative achievement.</v>

254
00:18:21.481 --> 00:18:22.740
<v Speaker 3>We put together this questionnaire,</v>

255
00:18:22.741 --> 00:18:25.680
<v Speaker 3>it's called the creative achievement questionnaire.</v>

256
00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.033
<v Speaker 3>And we got,</v>

257
00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:32.330
<v Speaker 3>what we did was we identified 13 dimensions of potential creative production and</v>

258
00:18:32.641 --> 00:18:34.230
<v Speaker 3>things like a culinary,</v>

259
00:18:34.231 --> 00:18:35.220
<v Speaker 3>architectural,</v>

260
00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:36.271
<v Speaker 3>entrepreneurial,</v>

261
00:18:36.271 --> 00:18:38.040
<v Speaker 3>financial dance,</v>

262
00:18:38.041 --> 00:18:38.820
<v Speaker 3>drama,</v>

263
00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:40.110
<v Speaker 3>Art Literature,</v>

264
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:41.520
<v Speaker 3>etc. Um,</v>

265
00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.860
<v Speaker 3>I think there was an intention category.</v>

266
00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:45.053
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>

267
00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:47.640
<v Speaker 3>we've covered the creative domains pretty,</v>

268
00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:48.241
<v Speaker 3>pretty well.</v>

269
00:18:48.241 --> 00:18:49.560
<v Speaker 3>And then we had experts,</v>

270
00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.430
<v Speaker 3>we ran different,</v>

271
00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:52.800
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

272
00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:53.401
<v Speaker 3>what would you call it?</v>

273
00:18:53.401 --> 00:18:54.820
<v Speaker 3>Strata of accomplishment.</v>

274
00:18:54.821 --> 00:18:56.100
<v Speaker 3>So zero would be,</v>

275
00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:59.220
<v Speaker 3>I have no training or recognized talent in this area.</v>

276
00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.480
<v Speaker 3>And like 10,</v>

277
00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.240
<v Speaker 3>I think it was up 10 point scale would be,</v>

278
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:03.541
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

279
00:19:03.541 --> 00:19:07.170
<v Speaker 3>I won an international prize for my find work in this area.</v>

280
00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:09.840
<v Speaker 3>And then we gave it to many,</v>

281
00:19:09.841 --> 00:19:10.171
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>

282
00:19:10.171 --> 00:19:10.860
<v Speaker 3>many people.</v>

283
00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:12.840
<v Speaker 3>And look at Iq as a predictor.</v>

284
00:19:12.841 --> 00:19:14.460
<v Speaker 3>Iq is a very good predictor by the way,</v>

285
00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:17.790
<v Speaker 3>Iq predicts almost everything that involves complex,</v>

286
00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:23.280
<v Speaker 3>complex cognitive operations and Iq is the most powerful predictor of social</v>

287
00:19:23.281 --> 00:19:24.930
<v Speaker 3>scientists have ever found.</v>

288
00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:29.760
<v Speaker 3>40 anything period by a factor of the vote for there's one exception,</v>

289
00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:35.150
<v Speaker 3>the correlation between inequality and male homicide is about 0.9 and that's the</v>

290
00:19:35.911 --> 00:19:38.190
<v Speaker 3>highest correlation we can do things I've ever seen.</v>

291
00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:39.930
<v Speaker 3>But other than that it's Iq.</v>

292
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:42.950
<v Speaker 3>And so I came as a good predictor trait.</v>

293
00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:46.020
<v Speaker 3>Openness and the big 5 cents was a good predictor of creative ability.</v>

294
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:50.700
<v Speaker 3>But one of the things we found was that the distribution of creative achievement</v>

295
00:19:50.701 --> 00:19:51.750
<v Speaker 3>was not normal.</v>

296
00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:55.530
<v Speaker 3>You know how a normal distribution works is most people are at the average and</v>

297
00:19:55.531 --> 00:19:57.000
<v Speaker 3>then a few people were at the tails.</v>

298
00:19:57.001 --> 00:19:59.140
<v Speaker 3>And that applies to Iq with a place to hike.</v>

299
00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:03.060
<v Speaker 3>It applies to weight and it applies to the big five traits.</v>

300
00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:07.230
<v Speaker 3>And there's a truism in psychology that most phenomena are normally distributed.</v>

301
00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:09.210
<v Speaker 3>A truism in statistics auction,</v>

302
00:20:09.211 --> 00:20:11.520
<v Speaker 3>but most most phenomena are normally distributed.</v>

303
00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:16.670
<v Speaker 3>But creative achievement is not normally distributed and neither are any of the</v>

304
00:20:16.861 --> 00:20:19.500
<v Speaker 3>phenomena that are associated with creative production in general,</v>

305
00:20:19.501 --> 00:20:21.270
<v Speaker 3>including the distribution of money.</v>

306
00:20:21.271 --> 00:20:22.104
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>

307
00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:27.320
<v Speaker 3>you know the one for Sam has tremendous w the 1% has a disproportionate amount</v>

308
00:20:28.021 --> 00:20:33.021
<v Speaker 3>of wealth and then if you take a 1% of the 1% they have a disproportionate</v>

309
00:20:33.091 --> 00:20:37.740
<v Speaker 3>amount of the wealth that the 1% has so that it's something like 85 people have</v>

310
00:20:37.741 --> 00:20:39.810
<v Speaker 3>as much money as blogging for two and a half billion.</v>

311
00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:41.520
<v Speaker 3>It's something like that and you think,</v>

312
00:20:41.521 --> 00:20:45.700
<v Speaker 3>well that's a terrible indictment of the capitalist system and no it's not by</v>

313
00:20:45.701 --> 00:20:46.230
<v Speaker 3>the way,</v>

314
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:47.740
<v Speaker 3>because the problem of inequality,</v>

315
00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:48.640
<v Speaker 3>which is a real problem,</v>

316
00:20:48.641 --> 00:20:52.300
<v Speaker 3>was way more serious and difficult.</v>

317
00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:57.450
<v Speaker 3>Then the problem of capitalism because any quality is a much more fundamental</v>

318
00:20:57.821 --> 00:21:01.780
<v Speaker 3>phenomenon because it manifests itself in all sorts of areas that have nothing</v>

319
00:21:01.781 --> 00:21:06.100
<v Speaker 3>to do with sociology or politics or economics manifest itself all everywhere</v>

320
00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:07.090
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

321
00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:09.600
<v Speaker 3>and what we found with the creative achievement questionnaire was everyone's</v>

322
00:21:09.601 --> 00:21:10.570
<v Speaker 3>stacked up at zero.</v>

323
00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:13.810
<v Speaker 3>It's like across the 13 dimension is 70%</v>

324
00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:20.490
<v Speaker 3>70% of people scored zero and about 10% scored one and with,</v>

325
00:21:20.491 --> 00:21:21.324
<v Speaker 3>with uh,</v>

326
00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:25.570
<v Speaker 3>and you can easily score like 60 people scored 60 on the creative achievement</v>

327
00:21:25.571 --> 00:21:25.761
<v Speaker 3>test.</v>

328
00:21:25.761 --> 00:21:26.120
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

329
00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:27.820
<v Speaker 3>but distribution look like this,</v>

330
00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:31.870
<v Speaker 3>everybody's stuck up at zero and there's a few people out here and they were,</v>

331
00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:32.880
<v Speaker 3>we never did.</v>

332
00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.030
<v Speaker 3>And that you see,</v>

333
00:21:34.031 --> 00:21:35.650
<v Speaker 3>you see that the scientific applications,</v>

334
00:21:35.651 --> 00:21:39.490
<v Speaker 3>you see it in hockey goals for number of compositions written,</v>

335
00:21:39.491 --> 00:21:40.300
<v Speaker 3>like how many of,</v>

336
00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:43.120
<v Speaker 3>how many classical compositions have you written?</v>

337
00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:44.021
<v Speaker 3>Zero,</v>

338
00:21:44.021 --> 00:21:44.854
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

339
00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:48.370
<v Speaker 3>And then you have chaos js,</v>

340
00:21:48.371 --> 00:21:53.371
<v Speaker 3>Bach who wrote so many classical compositions than if you hired a cop,</v>

341
00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:58.690
<v Speaker 3>competent copyist just to copy what he composed,</v>

342
00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:01.330
<v Speaker 3>it would take them 40 years of eight hour days.</v>

343
00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:02.960
<v Speaker 3>So that's what Jay was talking.</v>

344
00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:03.880
<v Speaker 3>And then castle,</v>

345
00:22:03.881 --> 00:22:04.300
<v Speaker 3>here's a,</v>

346
00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:05.260
<v Speaker 3>here's an example.</v>

347
00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:06.310
<v Speaker 3>So the castle,</v>

348
00:22:06.311 --> 00:22:07.310
<v Speaker 3>you're no potassium.</v>

349
00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:08.140
<v Speaker 3>Well that's for sure.</v>

350
00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:08.973
<v Speaker 3>How many payments?</v>

351
00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:10.300
<v Speaker 3>Zero.</v>

352
00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:13.210
<v Speaker 3>How many paintings did Picasso Painting say artworks?</v>

353
00:22:13.211 --> 00:22:13.841
<v Speaker 3>How many art first?</v>

354
00:22:13.841 --> 00:22:18.630
<v Speaker 3>Who could counsel produce 65,000 right?</v>

355
00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:19.810
<v Speaker 3>So three a day.</v>

356
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:22.030
<v Speaker 3>Every day for 65 years.</v>

357
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:23.260
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

358
00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:23.981
<v Speaker 3>And think about this,</v>

359
00:22:23.981 --> 00:22:25.900
<v Speaker 3>just absolutely feel income.</v>

360
00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:30.930
<v Speaker 3>And these were the castle's right [inaudible] he's whipping off some sketches.</v>

361
00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:33.641
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

362
00:22:33.641 --> 00:22:36.190
<v Speaker 3>no [inaudible] go online.</v>

363
00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:36.971
<v Speaker 3>You can go online,</v>

364
00:22:36.971 --> 00:22:41.740
<v Speaker 3>you can find me online and capacity archive and there's 15,000 of his pieces of</v>

365
00:22:41.741 --> 00:22:42.100
<v Speaker 3>art.</v>

366
00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:42.933
<v Speaker 3>Last I checked,</v>

367
00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:43.900
<v Speaker 3>which was a couple of years ago,</v>

368
00:22:43.901 --> 00:22:45.450
<v Speaker 3>it was probably like 20,000 hours.</v>

369
00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:46.960
<v Speaker 3>And it's just staggering.</v>

370
00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:47.221
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

371
00:22:47.221 --> 00:22:50.140
<v Speaker 3>you just cannot believe that someone could possibly do that.</v>

372
00:22:50.141 --> 00:22:52.090
<v Speaker 3>And really that's the way of the world.</v>

373
00:22:52.091 --> 00:22:53.620
<v Speaker 3>And so this old guy,</v>

374
00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:58.460
<v Speaker 3>he told me about the premium distribution and that blew me away,</v>

375
00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:01.910
<v Speaker 3>get so many bad explained the creative achievement questionnaire distribution</v>

376
00:23:01.911 --> 00:23:04.540
<v Speaker 3>because we didn't know like what the hell this is supposed to be normally</v>

377
00:23:04.541 --> 00:23:05.374
<v Speaker 3>distributed.</v>

378
00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:06.343
<v Speaker 3>It's not even,</v>

379
00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:07.330
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't,</v>

380
00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:08.910
<v Speaker 3>it's not normally distributed.</v>

381
00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:09.311
<v Speaker 3>It all.</v>

382
00:23:09.311 --> 00:23:10.970
<v Speaker 3>Everybody stacks up at Xerox,</v>

383
00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:11.980
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

384
00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:16.980
<v Speaker 3>which is like a rule to remember is the proclivity is for everyone to stack up</v>

385
00:23:17.021 --> 00:23:18.810
<v Speaker 3>at zero spree and well,</v>

386
00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:19.350
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

387
00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:19.470
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

388
00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:20.201
<v Speaker 3>zero is easy,</v>

389
00:23:20.201 --> 00:23:21.034
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

390
00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:22.090
<v Speaker 3>You just don't have anything.</v>

391
00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:25.240
<v Speaker 3>But that's the natural state of things is we don't have anything.</v>

392
00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:27.080
<v Speaker 3>And so it's not surprising,</v>

393
00:23:27.081 --> 00:23:28.330
<v Speaker 3>just people that have like zero.</v>

394
00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:30.970
<v Speaker 3>What's surprising is that some people don't.</v>

395
00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:35.500
<v Speaker 3>And then what else is surprising is how unbelievably hyper productive type of</v>

396
00:23:35.501 --> 00:23:36.640
<v Speaker 3>productive people are.</v>

397
00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:38.950
<v Speaker 3>It's just beyond belief.</v>

398
00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:39.880
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

399
00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:40.713
<v Speaker 3>Nikolai,</v>

400
00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:43.211
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

401
00:23:43.211 --> 00:23:47.660
<v Speaker 3>make light cast off and we get to the alternating who invented alternating</v>

402
00:23:47.661 --> 00:23:52.100
<v Speaker 3>current that African [inaudible] invented the electric motor and the electric</v>

403
00:23:52.101 --> 00:23:52.790
<v Speaker 3>generator.</v>

404
00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:54.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm not on any lists,</v>

405
00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:55.400
<v Speaker 3>other inventions.</v>

406
00:23:55.820 --> 00:24:00.820
<v Speaker 3>He said that whole inventions would pop into his mind in one burst,</v>

407
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.520
<v Speaker 3>right down to the angle of the screws,</v>

408
00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:07.010
<v Speaker 3>the screws that held the mechanisms together.</v>

409
00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:11.570
<v Speaker 3>And sometimes he would invent things so quickly that he couldn't get one written</v>

410
00:24:11.571 --> 00:24:14.690
<v Speaker 3>down before another coffee into his head and the win rate,</v>

411
00:24:14.691 --> 00:24:17.330
<v Speaker 3>the previous one and Mozart as well,</v>

412
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:18.223
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

413
00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:22.190
<v Speaker 3>quiet and Mozart was a little more understandable because he was unbelievably</v>

414
00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:24.740
<v Speaker 3>highly trained by his father as well as people prodigy.</v>

415
00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:28.400
<v Speaker 3>But he said whole symphonies would talking to these head at once and it was just</v>

416
00:24:28.401 --> 00:24:29.450
<v Speaker 3>a matter of writing it down,</v>

417
00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:30.211
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

418
00:24:30.211 --> 00:24:31.044
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

419
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:33.200
<v Speaker 3>so great achievement is really something,</v>

420
00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:34.580
<v Speaker 3>it's not like we understand it,</v>

421
00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:36.320
<v Speaker 3>but it's rare.</v>

422
00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:40.070
<v Speaker 3>And the people who are really good at it are prolific beyond belief.</v>

423
00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:40.730
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

424
00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:43.160
<v Speaker 3>So when you hear about the 1% coming on the money,</v>

425
00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:44.271
<v Speaker 3>you think,</v>

426
00:24:44.271 --> 00:24:46.770
<v Speaker 3>well that's a side effect of some pathological system.</v>

427
00:24:46.771 --> 00:24:47.031
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

428
00:24:47.031 --> 00:24:47.390
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

429
00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:47.571
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

430
00:24:47.571 --> 00:24:48.404
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

431
00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:49.370
<v Speaker 3>don't get,</v>

432
00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:52.070
<v Speaker 3>don't get over simplified about yes it's a big problem now.</v>

433
00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:53.320
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>

434
00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:54.081
<v Speaker 3>so this old guy,</v>

435
00:24:54.081 --> 00:24:54.590
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

436
00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:55.111
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

437
00:24:55.111 --> 00:24:55.944
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

438
00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:59.210
<v Speaker 3>he explained to me part of the reason staff,</v>

439
00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:00.523
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

440
00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:04.390
<v Speaker 3>the freedom distribution emerged stay with regards to money.</v>

441
00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:05.450
<v Speaker 3>And so it's,</v>

442
00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:09.290
<v Speaker 3>it's complicated and this is why Walter Chandelle is a book is also extremely</v>

443
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:10.150
<v Speaker 3>useful.</v>

444
00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:10.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

445
00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:15.650
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that seems to happen is that Iq has nonlinear effects.</v>

446
00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:18.440
<v Speaker 3>So as you can imagine why that might be,</v>

447
00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:21.950
<v Speaker 3>because if you're the first person to get somewhere then,</v>

448
00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:23.690
<v Speaker 3>except if you're creative,</v>

449
00:25:23.691 --> 00:25:26.240
<v Speaker 3>but if you're the first person to get somewhere,</v>

450
00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:30.260
<v Speaker 3>then you're more likely to benefit disproportionately from getting cause you're</v>

451
00:25:30.261 --> 00:25:31.250
<v Speaker 3>the first person.</v>

452
00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:33.140
<v Speaker 3>And so if you're there,</v>

453
00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:34.370
<v Speaker 3>if you have a high Iq,</v>

454
00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:36.290
<v Speaker 3>then you're faster than everyone else.</v>

455
00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:40.040
<v Speaker 3>And then if you align that also with the fact that you're going to network with</v>

456
00:25:40.041 --> 00:25:41.150
<v Speaker 3>other high Iq people,</v>

457
00:25:41.151 --> 00:25:43.580
<v Speaker 3>which is exactly what's happening in Silicon Valley for example,</v>

458
00:25:43.581 --> 00:25:47.210
<v Speaker 3>then that starts to become exponentially more worthwhile.</v>

459
00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:51.450
<v Speaker 3>And that's the thing too is that this is also associated with the premium</v>

460
00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:51.981
<v Speaker 3>distribution.</v>

461
00:25:51.981 --> 00:25:54.530
<v Speaker 3>There's another kind of iron law of economics,</v>

462
00:25:54.531 --> 00:25:56.330
<v Speaker 3>which is very sad law.</v>

463
00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:57.403
<v Speaker 3>They often,</v>

464
00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:00.260
<v Speaker 3>they called the Matthew principal often,</v>

465
00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:01.880
<v Speaker 3>which is an illusion,</v>

466
00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:04.040
<v Speaker 3>oddly enough to a new testament statement.</v>

467
00:26:04.041 --> 00:26:07.580
<v Speaker 3>And the New Testament statement is to those who have everything more will be</v>

468
00:26:07.581 --> 00:26:10.400
<v Speaker 3>given and from those who have nothing,</v>

469
00:26:10.401 --> 00:26:11.390
<v Speaker 3>everything will be taken.</v>

470
00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:14.570
<v Speaker 3>And that sort of aligned with another new testament statement,</v>

471
00:26:14.571 --> 00:26:17.270
<v Speaker 3>which is the poor will be with us always.</v>

472
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:18.583
<v Speaker 3>And for those are,</v>

473
00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:19.633
<v Speaker 3>those are pretty,</v>

474
00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:21.680
<v Speaker 3>those are pretty strange statements for,</v>

475
00:26:21.681 --> 00:26:24.020
<v Speaker 3>for for what purports to be an ethical document.</v>

476
00:26:24.021 --> 00:26:24.670
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

477
00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:27.530
<v Speaker 3>but I think what they do is to point to something that's very,</v>

478
00:26:27.531 --> 00:26:31.640
<v Speaker 3>very deep about the way that wealth is folk generate that distributed.</v>

479
00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:37.040
<v Speaker 3>And so there's nonlinear advantages to say having a higher Iq,</v>

480
00:26:37.041 --> 00:26:40.760
<v Speaker 3>there's potentially nonlinear advantages to having higher rates of</v>

481
00:26:40.761 --> 00:26:41.720
<v Speaker 3>conscientiousness.</v>

482
00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:45.750
<v Speaker 3>There's potentially nonlinear effects to being creative thinker,</v>

483
00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:48.630
<v Speaker 3>but then once you start being successful,</v>

484
00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:51.020
<v Speaker 3>you might think you start being successful at,</v>

485
00:26:51.021 --> 00:26:54.180
<v Speaker 3>and then it's a linear trend upwards or you start failing.</v>

486
00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:55.530
<v Speaker 3>It's a linear trend downwards,</v>

487
00:26:55.531 --> 00:26:56.310
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't,</v>

488
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:57.061
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't look like it.</v>

489
00:26:57.061 --> 00:27:00.360
<v Speaker 3>Graphs that with it looks like as you started being successful,</v>

490
00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:03.330
<v Speaker 3>each success makes the next success more probable.</v>

491
00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:06.780
<v Speaker 3>So it looks like this and there's your fail.</v>

492
00:27:06.781 --> 00:27:09.330
<v Speaker 3>Each failure makes the next family or more probable.</v>

493
00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:10.560
<v Speaker 3>So it looks like this.</v>

494
00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:11.453
<v Speaker 3>So there's,</v>

495
00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:12.300
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

496
00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:16.680
<v Speaker 3>there's scaling up on one side rapid if there's falling off a cliff on the other</v>

497
00:27:16.681 --> 00:27:17.400
<v Speaker 3>side,</v>

498
00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:19.230
<v Speaker 3>equally rapid and so,</v>

499
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:20.310
<v Speaker 3>and so that's,</v>

500
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:21.060
<v Speaker 3>that's the magic.</v>

501
00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:24.930
<v Speaker 3>That's discipline and those things offering together seem to produce this Prieto</v>

502
00:27:24.931 --> 00:27:25.591
<v Speaker 3>distribution.</v>

503
00:27:25.591 --> 00:27:27.270
<v Speaker 3>And the problem with the Credo distribution,</v>

504
00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:30.540
<v Speaker 3>as mark pointed out 120 years ago,</v>

505
00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:34.230
<v Speaker 3>he thought it was attributable to capitalism is the capital say hence to</v>

506
00:27:34.231 --> 00:27:37.290
<v Speaker 3>accumulate in the hands of fewer and fewer individuals.</v>

507
00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:39.660
<v Speaker 3>Now march was right about that.</v>

508
00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:40.920
<v Speaker 3>Frito had already figured that out.</v>

509
00:27:40.921 --> 00:27:43.080
<v Speaker 3>I think predo predated marks,</v>

510
00:27:43.081 --> 00:27:44.760
<v Speaker 3>although I'm not absolutely certain of that.</v>

511
00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:45.541
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

512
00:27:45.541 --> 00:27:47.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm hoping that it's true many reasons,</v>

513
00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:49.513
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

514
00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:52.620
<v Speaker 3>but march wasn't pessimistic and come on and they left.</v>

515
00:27:52.621 --> 00:27:56.100
<v Speaker 3>Wingers aren't pessimistic enough theaters because of course what drives</v>

516
00:27:56.101 --> 00:27:58.630
<v Speaker 3>politics on the left is the observation.</v>

517
00:27:58.631 --> 00:28:03.300
<v Speaker 3>So inequality and a potentially catastrophic if texted inequality and there are</v>

518
00:28:03.301 --> 00:28:05.850
<v Speaker 3>potentially catastrophic effects of inequality.</v>

519
00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:08.640
<v Speaker 3>That's the date that's also well documented.</v>

520
00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:10.590
<v Speaker 3>So if you're a good social scientist,</v>

521
00:28:10.591 --> 00:28:12.520
<v Speaker 3>you should know something about the credo distribution.</v>

522
00:28:12.521 --> 00:28:15.840
<v Speaker 3>You need to know something about the fact that creative achievement is a</v>

523
00:28:15.841 --> 00:28:16.980
<v Speaker 3>nonlinear process,</v>

524
00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:18.030
<v Speaker 3>will success.</v>

525
00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:21.480
<v Speaker 3>You should know something about the fact that Iq predicts lifetime performance</v>

526
00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:22.890
<v Speaker 3>as does conscientiousness,</v>

527
00:28:22.891 --> 00:28:24.210
<v Speaker 3>although not nearly as well.</v>

528
00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:25.443
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

529
00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:29.070
<v Speaker 3>and then there's this proclivity for success to Cascadian for failure to</v>

530
00:28:29.071 --> 00:28:29.820
<v Speaker 3>cascade.</v>

531
00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:31.140
<v Speaker 3>But you should also know that.</v>

532
00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:36.240
<v Speaker 3>And I think this is credible evidence that as inequality increases,</v>

533
00:28:36.241 --> 00:28:37.110
<v Speaker 3>as it seems to do,</v>

534
00:28:37.111 --> 00:28:40.380
<v Speaker 3>getting Zuora societies themselves to stabilize.</v>

535
00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:45.420
<v Speaker 3>So I mentioned earlier the two correlations that I know of that are very large.</v>

536
00:28:45.421 --> 00:28:48.300
<v Speaker 3>What is Iq predicting life success and the other ways,</v>

537
00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:49.733
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

538
00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:52.740
<v Speaker 3>Martha Wilson and Mark Daley.</v>

539
00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:53.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

540
00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:54.450
<v Speaker 3>Have your master university.</v>

541
00:28:54.451 --> 00:28:58.420
<v Speaker 3>These are the first people who discovered this is shocking research when it's on</v>

542
00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:01.890
<v Speaker 3>it because I'd never seen anything that was this powerful and in the social</v>

543
00:29:01.891 --> 00:29:02.670
<v Speaker 3>sciences.</v>

544
00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:04.820
<v Speaker 3>So they were interested in electronic mail on the song,</v>

545
00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:07.560
<v Speaker 3>and I had studied aggression.</v>

546
00:29:07.561 --> 00:29:09.690
<v Speaker 3>Males will make me also more aggressive,</v>

547
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:10.710
<v Speaker 3>aggressive than females.</v>

548
00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:12.930
<v Speaker 3>And I'll talk about that a little while.</v>

549
00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:15.210
<v Speaker 3>It's not a huge difference by the way.</v>

550
00:29:15.211 --> 00:29:18.870
<v Speaker 3>So if you picked a random woman at Orenda man of the population and you had to</v>

551
00:29:18.871 --> 00:29:21.590
<v Speaker 3>bet on who is more aggressive and you've bet on the band,</v>

552
00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:23.220
<v Speaker 3>you'd be right 60% of the time.</v>

553
00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:26.640
<v Speaker 3>So there's a huge amount of overlap between men and women with regards to</v>

554
00:29:26.641 --> 00:29:27.474
<v Speaker 3>depression.</v>

555
00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:29.640
<v Speaker 3>And this is another thing you might want to understand.</v>

556
00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:31.310
<v Speaker 3>It's really important to understand this,</v>

557
00:29:31.311 --> 00:29:31.471
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

558
00:29:31.471 --> 00:29:36.130
<v Speaker 3>the two groups can be very similar with walking differences at the tails.</v>

559
00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:36.991
<v Speaker 3>So here,</v>

560
00:29:36.991 --> 00:29:37.830
<v Speaker 3>here's an example.</v>

561
00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:39.390
<v Speaker 3>So let's say</v>

562
00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:42.520
<v Speaker 3>the overlap between men and women.</v>

563
00:29:42.521 --> 00:29:44.860
<v Speaker 3>This is substantial with regards to depression.</v>

564
00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:48.490
<v Speaker 3>But let's say we don't care about aggression except when we're talking about the</v>

565
00:29:48.491 --> 00:29:51.930
<v Speaker 3>person who's the most aggressive out of 100 can.</v>

566
00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:54.220
<v Speaker 3>You can imagine that would be the case because you don't really care if</v>

567
00:29:54.221 --> 00:29:57.070
<v Speaker 3>someone's aggressive as long as they don't come into your house with the gun,</v>

568
00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:57.701
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

569
00:29:57.701 --> 00:29:59.080
<v Speaker 3>They can be pretty damn aggressive,</v>

570
00:29:59.081 --> 00:30:03.610
<v Speaker 3>but when they cross that line into outright aggressive criminality,</v>

571
00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:07.690
<v Speaker 3>then they'd hit a threshold and that threshold essentially means incarceration.</v>

572
00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:08.591
<v Speaker 3>So you might say,</v>

573
00:30:08.591 --> 00:30:09.220
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

574
00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:12.970
<v Speaker 3>what proportion of men are the most aggressive people?</v>

575
00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:15.880
<v Speaker 3>And then after that it's something like nine out of 10 it depends on how you</v>

576
00:30:15.881 --> 00:30:16.770
<v Speaker 3>slice it August thing,</v>

577
00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:19.240
<v Speaker 3>but the more aggressive the slice,</v>

578
00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:23.530
<v Speaker 3>the higher the proportion of men and that's why 910 people in prison are manner.</v>

579
00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:26.740
<v Speaker 3>Even though on average men and women don't give her that much aggression.</v>

580
00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:28.750
<v Speaker 3>And so it's really important as well.</v>

581
00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:32.200
<v Speaker 3>It should be taught basic statistics,</v>

582
00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:34.270
<v Speaker 3>somewhat sophisticated I would say,</v>

583
00:30:34.271 --> 00:30:34.810
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

584
00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:38.500
<v Speaker 3>but that kind of statistics needs to be taught to people that junior high and</v>

585
00:30:38.501 --> 00:30:41.770
<v Speaker 3>high school because otherwise you can't understand easily the way the world</v>

586
00:30:41.771 --> 00:30:42.041
<v Speaker 3>works.</v>

587
00:30:42.041 --> 00:30:45.340
<v Speaker 3>You can't understand how men and women can be mostly the same,</v>

588
00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:49.270
<v Speaker 3>but they can still be really different to the extreme than a lot of activity</v>

589
00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.500
<v Speaker 3>occurs at the extremes.</v>

590
00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:54.850
<v Speaker 3>You can say the same thing about men in engineering and women in nursing.</v>

591
00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:58.390
<v Speaker 3>So the evidence on this is becoming increasingly clear.</v>

592
00:30:58.510 --> 00:30:59.343
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

593
00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:00.863
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

594
00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:04.360
<v Speaker 3>the more gender equal the state,</v>

595
00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:08.170
<v Speaker 3>the bigger the difference in interest between men and women.</v>

596
00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:12.790
<v Speaker 3>Now it's exactly the opposite of what social scientists assume they talking 25</v>

597
00:31:12.791 --> 00:31:13.181
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

598
00:31:13.181 --> 00:31:15.730
<v Speaker 3>Cause we assume everyone assumed that whole,</v>

599
00:31:15.731 --> 00:31:20.210
<v Speaker 3>perhaps as you made societies more gender neutral in their sociological</v>

600
00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:21.063
<v Speaker 3>structures,</v>

601
00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:24.010
<v Speaker 3>that personality differences between them,</v>

602
00:31:24.011 --> 00:31:25.090
<v Speaker 3>the women's would be creased.</v>

603
00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:25.990
<v Speaker 3>That's over happened.</v>

604
00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:26.230
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

605
00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:27.063
<v Speaker 3>Maximize.</v>

606
00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:30.910
<v Speaker 3>And it's because you take all the environmental variability out of the equation,</v>

607
00:31:30.911 --> 00:31:33.830
<v Speaker 3>you're left with nothing about biological variability and maximizers.</v>

608
00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:39.270
<v Speaker 3>And so there's new paper that was just posted today on exactly this topic</v>

609
00:31:39.401 --> 00:31:43.540
<v Speaker 3>showing them the most general neutral countries have the biggest differences in</v>

610
00:31:43.541 --> 00:31:44.560
<v Speaker 3>educational choice.</v>

611
00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:49.210
<v Speaker 3>And so it's really interesting and UCR damn government keeps rattling the cage</v>

612
00:31:49.211 --> 00:31:53.050
<v Speaker 3>votes stem fields and about how the fact that women are underrepresented in stem</v>

613
00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:54.950
<v Speaker 3>means that there's sociological bias.</v>

614
00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:55.660
<v Speaker 3>All the wives,</v>

615
00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:57.430
<v Speaker 3>by the way in terms of hiring the freezers,</v>

616
00:31:57.431 --> 00:31:59.380
<v Speaker 3>dispatch deals is in favor of women.</v>

617
00:31:59.381 --> 00:32:04.381
<v Speaker 3>Now the empirical data on that is absolutely crystal clear and so whatever is</v>

618
00:32:04.601 --> 00:32:08.920
<v Speaker 3>driving the difference in hiring and theirs isn't undergraduate rates of</v>

619
00:32:08.921 --> 00:32:13.720
<v Speaker 3>graduation item and it's not proficiency because if you look at proficiency in</v>

620
00:32:13.721 --> 00:32:16.480
<v Speaker 3>mathematical reasoning and scientific ability,</v>

621
00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:19.330
<v Speaker 3>mathematical reason in particular among junior high kids,</v>

622
00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:20.400
<v Speaker 3>women and manner,</v>

623
00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:24.910
<v Speaker 3>there are girls and boys basically indistinguishable and if you follow up high</v>

624
00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:27.910
<v Speaker 3>achieving women from junior high who have,</v>

625
00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:30.940
<v Speaker 3>who are disproportionately intelligent mathematics,</v>

626
00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:34.050
<v Speaker 3>what happens is they don't go into mathematics or into the stem fields because</v>

627
00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:34.903
<v Speaker 3>the known interested in it.</v>

628
00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:38.410
<v Speaker 3>It's not because they are pretty important thing to know,</v>

629
00:32:38.411 --> 00:32:38.760
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

630
00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:41.100
<v Speaker 3>It differences in ability that's driving this,</v>

631
00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:44.090
<v Speaker 3>it's difference in interest and the difference in interests between men and</v>

632
00:32:44.091 --> 00:32:48.470
<v Speaker 3>women are the biggest psychometric differences that we know of between the</v>

633
00:32:48.471 --> 00:32:49.250
<v Speaker 3>genders,</v>

634
00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:50.330
<v Speaker 3>bigger than personality,</v>

635
00:32:50.331 --> 00:32:50.810
<v Speaker 3>different stuff.</v>

636
00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:51.291
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>

637
00:32:51.291 --> 00:32:56.291
<v Speaker 3>which are also big enough to have walloping affects FFA also going off after you</v>

638
00:32:56.331 --> 00:32:57.500
<v Speaker 3>get the average.</v>

639
00:32:57.860 --> 00:32:58.460
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>

640
00:32:58.460 --> 00:32:59.420
<v Speaker 3>back to this old guy,</v>

641
00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:00.663
<v Speaker 3>he um,</v>

642
00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:02.420
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

643
00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:05.960
<v Speaker 3>he said to me he'd been thinking a lot about the previous just reaching in.</v>

644
00:33:05.961 --> 00:33:06.920
<v Speaker 3>His theory was</v>

645
00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:11.710
<v Speaker 3>there are a lot of factors that drive the,</v>

646
00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:14.780
<v Speaker 3>the distribution of wealth because he was most concerned about well,</v>

647
00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:20.040
<v Speaker 3>but what happens is that as a society ratchets forward the proclivity for wealth</v>

648
00:33:21.081 --> 00:33:25.610
<v Speaker 3>distributed self on equally nonce and mounts and mounts and mounts until there's</v>

649
00:33:25.611 --> 00:33:30.611
<v Speaker 3>so many people stacked up at zero that they flip the board over because zero is</v>

650
00:33:32.271 --> 00:33:34.670
<v Speaker 3>a very difficult place to escape from.</v>

651
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:35.301
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

652
00:33:35.301 --> 00:33:38.930
<v Speaker 3>you can fall into a poverty trap where you're so poor that nothing you do gets</v>

653
00:33:38.931 --> 00:33:39.560
<v Speaker 3>you going,</v>

654
00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:40.850
<v Speaker 3>it can't get any traction.</v>

655
00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:44.660
<v Speaker 3>You kind of know that if you had just tried to start a business because the</v>

656
00:33:44.661 --> 00:33:45.320
<v Speaker 3>hardest,</v>

657
00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:47.750
<v Speaker 3>the most difficult customer to find for your businesses,</v>

658
00:33:47.751 --> 00:33:50.900
<v Speaker 3>the first customer is disproportionately difficult.</v>

659
00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:51.920
<v Speaker 3>Once you find one,</v>

660
00:33:51.921 --> 00:33:53.030
<v Speaker 3>the second one is way easier.</v>

661
00:33:53.031 --> 00:33:56.360
<v Speaker 3>And once you have a hundred it's like all of the hundred and first is relatively</v>

662
00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:57.050
<v Speaker 3>simple.</v>

663
00:33:57.050 --> 00:33:59.060
<v Speaker 3>But that first paying customer,</v>

664
00:33:59.450 --> 00:33:59.751
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

665
00:33:59.751 --> 00:34:00.740
<v Speaker 3>good luck with that.</v>

666
00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.150
<v Speaker 3>It's virtually impossible.</v>

667
00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:04.040
<v Speaker 3>So his idea was that</v>

668
00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:06.270
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

669
00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:07.990
<v Speaker 3>Oh and I can tell you other,</v>

670
00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:09.890
<v Speaker 3>some other interesting things about this too,</v>

671
00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:13.730
<v Speaker 3>he turned me on to the work of a group of people called economy physicists.</v>

672
00:34:13.731 --> 00:34:16.230
<v Speaker 3>And I talking to what quantum physicists is,</v>

673
00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:17.360
<v Speaker 3>those people don't exist.</v>

674
00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:20.570
<v Speaker 3>You can go look on,</v>

675
00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:23.990
<v Speaker 3>you can go look online and they have interesting animations to be a quantum</v>

676
00:34:23.991 --> 00:34:24.531
<v Speaker 3>physicist.</v>

677
00:34:24.531 --> 00:34:26.210
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things they do here,</v>

678
00:34:26.211 --> 00:34:27.044
<v Speaker 3>and here's a way of,</v>

679
00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:29.870
<v Speaker 3>of imagining how wealth distributes itself.</v>

680
00:34:30.410 --> 00:34:34.060
<v Speaker 3>So imagine that I gave everybody in the room $10 okay,</v>

681
00:34:34.061 --> 00:34:37.550
<v Speaker 3>so you all have $10 and so you're at a state of maximum equality,</v>

682
00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:38.220
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

683
00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:42.170
<v Speaker 3>And now you start to engage in a trading game and it's a simple trading game.</v>

684
00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:43.340
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

685
00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:43.650
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

686
00:34:43.650 --> 00:34:45.790
<v Speaker 3>you just go up to someone and you flip a coin.</v>

687
00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:47.270
<v Speaker 3>If it's heads,</v>

688
00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:52.360
<v Speaker 3>then you buy a fictitional banana from them and eat it and you give them adult.</v>

689
00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:56.220
<v Speaker 3>And so you walk away with nine and they walk away,</v>

690
00:34:56.290 --> 00:34:58.190
<v Speaker 3>let them and you just keep trading.</v>

691
00:34:58.760 --> 00:34:59.001
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

692
00:34:59.001 --> 00:35:03.930
<v Speaker 3>So what happens first is that there are a stack managing the Grep.</v>

693
00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:08.960
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's stacked up a $10 now he's starting to trade just as many people when</v>

694
00:35:08.961 --> 00:35:09.794
<v Speaker 3>as lose.</v>

695
00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:11.740
<v Speaker 3>So you get a normal distribution first.</v>

696
00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:14.840
<v Speaker 3>But then after 10 bad trades,</v>

697
00:35:14.841 --> 00:35:19.250
<v Speaker 3>some poor sucker has 10 tales in row and then they hit zero.</v>

698
00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:21.290
<v Speaker 3>But what happens when you hit zero,</v>

699
00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:22.911
<v Speaker 3>you're own the game,</v>

700
00:35:22.911 --> 00:35:23.270
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

701
00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:24.103
<v Speaker 3>you're done.</v>

702
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:26.330
<v Speaker 3>And so then everyone keeps trading.</v>

703
00:35:26.331 --> 00:35:27.051
<v Speaker 3>So what happens?</v>

704
00:35:27.051 --> 00:35:27.231
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

705
00:35:27.231 --> 00:35:30.680
<v Speaker 3>that distribution starts to turn it from a normal distribution of this tail</v>

706
00:35:30.681 --> 00:35:34.760
<v Speaker 3>starts to stack up as people stack up at zero zero was mom,</v>

707
00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:38.430
<v Speaker 3>and then the number of people who are winning the get smaller and smaller and</v>

708
00:35:38.431 --> 00:35:39.090
<v Speaker 3>smaller,</v>

709
00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:40.300
<v Speaker 3>the one person has all the mind.</v>

710
00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.840
<v Speaker 3>Now you know that because you've played an awful</v>

711
00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:44.700
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

712
00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:46.140
<v Speaker 3>That's what happens to monopoly game.</v>

713
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:49.860
<v Speaker 3>If the game is over when one person wins everything.</v>

714
00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:51.400
<v Speaker 3>And so you can mark,</v>

715
00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:54.330
<v Speaker 3>this is such a robust phenomenon that you've been put online,</v>

716
00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:55.900
<v Speaker 3>but you can get along with them.</v>

717
00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:56.993
<v Speaker 3>Monopoly game.</v>

718
00:35:57.210 --> 00:35:58.920
<v Speaker 3>And so we really do understand this now.</v>

719
00:35:58.921 --> 00:35:59.754
<v Speaker 3>The problem is,</v>

720
00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:02.260
<v Speaker 3>or the problem that my old clients,</v>

721
00:36:02.261 --> 00:36:07.261
<v Speaker 3>they bought the problem with regards to the proclivity of money to distribute</v>

722
00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:10.590
<v Speaker 3>itself in that manner with reverse feed on a physicist.</v>

723
00:36:10.591 --> 00:36:12.120
<v Speaker 3>So that was one of the graphs they produced.</v>

724
00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:16.260
<v Speaker 3>They also showed that money tends to distribute itself and the society and can</v>

725
00:36:16.261 --> 00:36:20.190
<v Speaker 3>be worn by the same equations as gas distributing itself into a vacuum.</v>

726
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:23.730
<v Speaker 3>That's another example of how fundamental a problem this is.</v>

727
00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:28.880
<v Speaker 3>This is a fundamental problem and it can't be wait hand waved away with some</v>

728
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.180
<v Speaker 3>reference to the vagaries and political systems.</v>

729
00:36:33.570 --> 00:36:34.403
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

730
00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:35.880
<v Speaker 3>so that was his,</v>

731
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.920
<v Speaker 3>his hypothesis is that all the game kept going until two few people won</v>

732
00:36:40.921 --> 00:36:41.401
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

733
00:36:41.401 --> 00:36:44.550
<v Speaker 3>And then there'd be a revolution because the people at the bottom,</v>

734
00:36:44.551 --> 00:36:46.710
<v Speaker 3>especially the angry young males,</v>

735
00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:50.370
<v Speaker 3>because they're very status conscious and if they can't live themselves off the</v>

736
00:36:50.371 --> 00:36:54.720
<v Speaker 3>bottom rung and they're not interesting to women and so they're not in the</v>

737
00:36:54.721 --> 00:36:55.371
<v Speaker 3>dating game,</v>

738
00:36:55.371 --> 00:36:56.340
<v Speaker 3>the main game at all.</v>

739
00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:57.990
<v Speaker 3>And that makes them hyper aggressive.</v>

740
00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:01.740
<v Speaker 3>And that's what's driving the correlation between male homicide and inequality.</v>

741
00:37:01.741 --> 00:37:02.760
<v Speaker 3>Which is about 0.9,</v>

742
00:37:02.761 --> 00:37:03.241
<v Speaker 3>as I said.</v>

743
00:37:03.241 --> 00:37:04.720
<v Speaker 3>So if you go to counties across,</v>

744
00:37:04.890 --> 00:37:07.710
<v Speaker 3>this is between countries and within countries by the waist.</v>

745
00:37:07.711 --> 00:37:09.060
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely robust data.</v>

746
00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:12.450
<v Speaker 3>And so what you find is if you go places where everyone's pouring,</v>

747
00:37:12.451 --> 00:37:13.260
<v Speaker 3>the men are quiet.</v>

748
00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:15.660
<v Speaker 3>And if you go places where everyone's rich but then aren't fine.</v>

749
00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:19.270
<v Speaker 3>But if you both places where there's this steep gradient between rich and poor,</v>

750
00:37:19.271 --> 00:37:21.630
<v Speaker 3>so neighborhoods that are mixed economic with that say,</v>

751
00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:23.910
<v Speaker 3>then the male homicide rates starts to ratchet up.</v>

752
00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:29.100
<v Speaker 3>And you can imagine that it's the most aggressive males by temperament that get</v>

753
00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:32.800
<v Speaker 3>most aggressive soonest as inequality gets crazy.</v>

754
00:37:32.801 --> 00:37:34.590
<v Speaker 3>So there's still the psychological component,</v>

755
00:37:34.591 --> 00:37:37.170
<v Speaker 3>but what's driving it fundamentally is inequality.</v>

756
00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:40.080
<v Speaker 3>And so the reason we're not,</v>

757
00:37:40.081 --> 00:37:40.590
<v Speaker 3>when I first,</v>

758
00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:42.810
<v Speaker 3>that was Martin Daly and Marco Wilson's work,</v>

759
00:37:42.811 --> 00:37:45.540
<v Speaker 3>they're both Canadian traffic McMaster and brilliant,</v>

760
00:37:45.541 --> 00:37:46.080
<v Speaker 3>brilliant,</v>

761
00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:46.913
<v Speaker 3>brilliant work.</v>

762
00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:48.000
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

763
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.210
<v Speaker 3>they also demonstrated because they studied homicides in Chicago,</v>

764
00:37:51.211 --> 00:37:52.000
<v Speaker 3>in the inner cities,</v>

765
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.820
<v Speaker 3>and they concluded that for a typical inner city dweller in Chicago,</v>

766
00:37:56.970 --> 00:38:01.200
<v Speaker 3>homicide wasn't effective status move with regards to moving yourself up the</v>

767
00:38:01.201 --> 00:38:02.920
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy because you,</v>

768
00:38:02.921 --> 00:38:03.180
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

769
00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:04.013
<v Speaker 3>you be in a,</v>

770
00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:06.180
<v Speaker 3>within race competition,</v>

771
00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:10.020
<v Speaker 3>first of all because most murders occurred within race and so most of that was</v>

772
00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:12.590
<v Speaker 3>dominance dispute and you plea bargain.</v>

773
00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:13.541
<v Speaker 3>And then if it,</v>

774
00:38:13.541 --> 00:38:14.374
<v Speaker 3>if it was our,</v>

775
00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:16.060
<v Speaker 3>it was the sort of fight to turned into a murder,</v>

776
00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:17.850
<v Speaker 3>this sort of dispute that turned into a murder.</v>

777
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.670
<v Speaker 3>You could claim self defense,</v>

778
00:38:20.671 --> 00:38:20.881
<v Speaker 3>plea,</v>

779
00:38:20.881 --> 00:38:23.400
<v Speaker 3>bargain it down to manslaughter,</v>

780
00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:25.710
<v Speaker 3>be in jail hypothetically for three years,</v>

781
00:38:25.711 --> 00:38:29.100
<v Speaker 3>but you give them after 18 months and your street pregnant guys enough so that</v>

782
00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:31.190
<v Speaker 3>it was actually a viable economic decisions.</v>

783
00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:32.640
<v Speaker 3>It's harsh modeling,</v>

784
00:38:32.641 --> 00:38:32.860
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

785
00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:35.710
<v Speaker 3>Like real social science produces results and if no one likes</v>

786
00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:41.200
<v Speaker 3>the findings are real social scientists and you go home.</v>

787
00:38:41.201 --> 00:38:42.034
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

788
00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:49.750
<v Speaker 3>that's why I think you've been trust in gender data on personality by the way,</v>

789
00:38:49.751 --> 00:38:50.770
<v Speaker 3>because you know,</v>

790
00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:55.150
<v Speaker 3>it's a truism that the social sciences or are left leaning as to say the least.</v>

791
00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:55.841
<v Speaker 3>They're left leaning.</v>

792
00:38:55.841 --> 00:39:00.841
<v Speaker 3>And so the fact that social scientists have found and gender differences in</v>

793
00:39:00.941 --> 00:39:04.270
<v Speaker 3>personality maximize any Galitary and societies,</v>

794
00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:05.770
<v Speaker 3>but that's rock solid data.</v>

795
00:39:05.830 --> 00:39:08.980
<v Speaker 3>There's no one was like having a party when they discovered that no one was</v>

796
00:39:08.981 --> 00:39:09.430
<v Speaker 3>going to,</v>

797
00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:09.701
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

798
00:39:09.701 --> 00:39:11.170
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly what we're hoping.</v>

799
00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:13.130
<v Speaker 3>He isn't it good to like no,</v>

800
00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:14.350
<v Speaker 3>it's like no,</v>

801
00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:15.400
<v Speaker 3>that can't be right.</v>

802
00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:19.810
<v Speaker 3>We bet in like quadrupled our sample size and do 10 more analysis.</v>

803
00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:21.340
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

804
00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:22.240
<v Speaker 3>here it is again.</v>

805
00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:25.630
<v Speaker 3>I guess we have to publish this.</v>

806
00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:27.050
<v Speaker 3>That's the lines of thing.</v>

807
00:39:27.110 --> 00:39:27.830
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

808
00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:30.350
<v Speaker 3>so another example of that,</v>

809
00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:31.193
<v Speaker 3>I can say this,</v>

810
00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:31.870
<v Speaker 3>there was,</v>

811
00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:34.450
<v Speaker 3>this is also with regards to the inequality is that,</v>

812
00:39:34.490 --> 00:39:35.323
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

813
00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:38.650
<v Speaker 3>I spent a lot of time reading the ICU literature.</v>

814
00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:41.680
<v Speaker 3>I started that about 20 years ago and I was,</v>

815
00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:45.190
<v Speaker 3>I was reading out because while I was interested in what predicts human</v>

816
00:39:45.191 --> 00:39:49.390
<v Speaker 3>performance across time and a ton of Iq definitely does.</v>

817
00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.640
<v Speaker 3>And I keep it by the way,</v>

818
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.760
<v Speaker 3>they're very easy to design.</v>

819
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:56.860
<v Speaker 3>So I'll kind you how to make an Iq test.</v>

820
00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:57.873
<v Speaker 3>It's real simple.</v>

821
00:39:57.970 --> 00:40:01.840
<v Speaker 3>So imagine that you have that Universal Library of questions.</v>

822
00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:04.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't care what type of questions they are.</v>

823
00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:05.770
<v Speaker 3>Mathematical Puzzles,</v>

824
00:40:05.771 --> 00:40:06.640
<v Speaker 3>verbal puzzles,</v>

825
00:40:06.641 --> 00:40:07.540
<v Speaker 3>general knowledge,</v>

826
00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:08.330
<v Speaker 3>vocabulary,</v>

827
00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:12.630
<v Speaker 3>like any sort of question that someone could answer and that,</v>

828
00:40:12.631 --> 00:40:13.900
<v Speaker 3>so maybe some people couldn't.</v>

829
00:40:13.901 --> 00:40:16.930
<v Speaker 3>So then they'd have to be questions with a certain degree of difficulty.</v>

830
00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:20.320
<v Speaker 3>So imagine you have 100,000 questions like that.</v>

831
00:40:20.321 --> 00:40:25.321
<v Speaker 3>You just throw them in a pile and then you randomly select a hundred of them and</v>

832
00:40:25.541 --> 00:40:30.190
<v Speaker 3>then you give them to 400 people and you tell me up their scores and you rank</v>

833
00:40:30.191 --> 00:40:31.180
<v Speaker 3>order the scores.</v>

834
00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:34.331
<v Speaker 3>Not Exactly.</v>

835
00:40:34.331 --> 00:40:35.500
<v Speaker 3>You should correct for age,</v>

836
00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:36.730
<v Speaker 3>but forget about that.</v>

837
00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:37.780
<v Speaker 3>Fundamentally.</v>

838
00:40:37.781 --> 00:40:39.620
<v Speaker 3>That's how I view and then can find.</v>

839
00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:43.210
<v Speaker 3>So you took those hundred vendors questions and you gave him never,</v>

840
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:44.350
<v Speaker 3>when you rank ordered their,</v>

841
00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:45.010
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>

842
00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:45.843
<v Speaker 3>their performance.</v>

843
00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:51.180
<v Speaker 3>Let's say you pull up another 100 and you give them to the same 400 people and</v>

844
00:40:51.431 --> 00:40:53.140
<v Speaker 3>you produced another rank order,</v>

845
00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:54.143
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

846
00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:56.140
<v Speaker 3>And you correlated the two rank orders,</v>

847
00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:59.770
<v Speaker 3>you'd find that the correlation was about [inaudible] 93 something like that.</v>

848
00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:03.340
<v Speaker 3>So the people who did really well on the first hundred set of questions are</v>

849
00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:07.010
<v Speaker 3>overwhelmingly likely to be the people to do very well with the second set of a</v>

850
00:41:07.011 --> 00:41:07.810
<v Speaker 3>hundred questions.</v>

851
00:41:07.810 --> 00:41:09.520
<v Speaker 3>And that's all there is to Iq.</v>

852
00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:11.560
<v Speaker 3>That's the whole damn picture now.</v>

853
00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:16.720
<v Speaker 3>And then that predicts longterm life success with enough potency.</v>

854
00:41:16.721 --> 00:41:21.250
<v Speaker 3>So imagine you were picking people for a job and used an Iq test to pick them,</v>

855
00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:22.510
<v Speaker 3>or you chose the randomly.</v>

856
00:41:22.810 --> 00:41:24.250
<v Speaker 3>So if you didn't chose the randomly,</v>

857
00:41:24.251 --> 00:41:28.530
<v Speaker 3>it would be a 50% failure rate if he chose them with Iq test to be a 25% failure</v>

858
00:41:28.531 --> 00:41:29.260
<v Speaker 3>rate.</v>

859
00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:33.500
<v Speaker 3>And so it's a walloping effect and everyone knows that really,</v>

860
00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:34.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

861
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:36.070
<v Speaker 3>you know perfectly well that</v>

862
00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:41.570
<v Speaker 3>complex cognitive operations are easier for smart people.</v>

863
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:45.250
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's just not that stag when your realization never,</v>

864
00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:49.670
<v Speaker 3>we're not so happy about the corollary,</v>

865
00:41:49.671 --> 00:41:52.610
<v Speaker 3>which is the complex cognitive operations are very,</v>

866
00:41:52.611 --> 00:41:54.140
<v Speaker 3>very difficult for people.</v>

867
00:41:54.141 --> 00:41:54.974
<v Speaker 3>Learn smart.</v>

868
00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:56.300
<v Speaker 3>We don't like that.</v>

869
00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:57.530
<v Speaker 3>No wonder,</v>

870
00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:59.450
<v Speaker 3>no wonder because it's a terrible thing.</v>

871
00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:00.860
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>

872
00:42:00.861 --> 00:42:05.180
<v Speaker 3>the US military has it been doing Iq testing since like 19,</v>

873
00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:05.931
<v Speaker 3>I think 19,</v>

874
00:42:05.931 --> 00:42:07.190
<v Speaker 3>19 really,</v>

875
00:42:07.191 --> 00:42:08.024
<v Speaker 3>really early.</v>

876
00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:08.991
<v Speaker 3>And you think,</v>

877
00:42:08.991 --> 00:42:09.710
<v Speaker 3>well why?</v>

878
00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:10.543
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

879
00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:13.190
<v Speaker 3>partly because during times of emergency,</v>

880
00:42:13.191 --> 00:42:14.024
<v Speaker 3>like work on</v>

881
00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:21.790
<v Speaker 3>when you have to ramp up or else then maybe you want to figure out a way to</v>

882
00:42:22.491 --> 00:42:25.550
<v Speaker 3>select people rapidly so you can figure out who should be officers from,</v>

883
00:42:25.551 --> 00:42:27.140
<v Speaker 3>who should be soldiers critically.</v>

884
00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:28.910
<v Speaker 3>So like you don't lose the war.</v>

885
00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:30.350
<v Speaker 3>It's actually very important.</v>

886
00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:32.210
<v Speaker 3>And so the army,</v>

887
00:42:32.211 --> 00:42:36.260
<v Speaker 3>the armed forces in the US get a lot of Iq research and established a lot of the</v>

888
00:42:36.261 --> 00:42:37.061
<v Speaker 3>basic segment.</v>

889
00:42:37.061 --> 00:42:37.331
<v Speaker 3>You're coming,</v>

890
00:42:37.331 --> 00:42:38.530
<v Speaker 3>you're standing of Iq Cuban,</v>

891
00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:39.853
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

892
00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:43.280
<v Speaker 3>about 20 years ago might be longer than that.</v>

893
00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:45.140
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

894
00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:46.040
<v Speaker 3>there was a legal,</v>

895
00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:51.240
<v Speaker 3>there's a new law passed in the United States with regards to investing in</v>

896
00:42:51.241 --> 00:42:52.490
<v Speaker 3>people into the armed forces.</v>

897
00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:54.950
<v Speaker 3>So imagine first,</v>

898
00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:56.570
<v Speaker 3>there's another example.</v>

899
00:42:56.810 --> 00:42:58.720
<v Speaker 3>Reliable social satire that hit.</v>

900
00:42:58.730 --> 00:43:00.470
<v Speaker 3>So now you run the armed forces.</v>

901
00:43:00.830 --> 00:43:01.750
<v Speaker 3>So what's your problem?</v>

902
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:04.280
<v Speaker 3>First problem is manpower shortage,</v>

903
00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:05.910
<v Speaker 3>especially if it's wartime.</v>

904
00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:06.920
<v Speaker 3>But even in these times,</v>

905
00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:09.080
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to get enough people into the military.</v>

906
00:43:09.590 --> 00:43:10.820
<v Speaker 3>So what's your goal?</v>

907
00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:13.670
<v Speaker 3>Take everyone you possibly can.</v>

908
00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:14.960
<v Speaker 3>That's your goal,</v>

909
00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:15.590
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

910
00:43:15.590 --> 00:43:17.030
<v Speaker 3>And let's say it's splots war type,</v>

911
00:43:17.031 --> 00:43:18.020
<v Speaker 3>that's bloody obvious.</v>

912
00:43:18.021 --> 00:43:19.160
<v Speaker 3>You want to take everyone you can.</v>

913
00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:20.420
<v Speaker 3>But then there's another layer,</v>

914
00:43:20.421 --> 00:43:20.751
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

915
00:43:20.751 --> 00:43:24.890
<v Speaker 3>let's say it's peace time and you want to keep the armed forces functional,</v>

916
00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:28.400
<v Speaker 3>but you also want the armed forces to play another rule which they couldn't</v>

917
00:43:28.401 --> 00:43:28.700
<v Speaker 3>play,</v>

918
00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:30.600
<v Speaker 3>which would be to take people from the underpass,</v>

919
00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:30.920
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

920
00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:35.420
<v Speaker 3>Things stack up at zero and trained them to do something useful and move them</v>

921
00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:39.380
<v Speaker 3>into the working class or maybe in the middle cloud because the armed forces for</v>

922
00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:43.670
<v Speaker 3>compared to the u s that the news doesn't ave with social mobility and logically</v>

923
00:43:43.671 --> 00:43:44.420
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

924
00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:44.721
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

925
00:43:44.721 --> 00:43:46.640
<v Speaker 3>so then you have people who are doing the research,</v>

926
00:43:46.641 --> 00:43:48.680
<v Speaker 3>who are damn motivated to take.</v>

927
00:43:48.681 --> 00:43:53.681
<v Speaker 3>Everyone may can and also to believe that training will work because that's what</v>

928
00:43:53.841 --> 00:43:54.261
<v Speaker 3>you'd hope.</v>

929
00:43:54.261 --> 00:43:55.370
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to take every one,</v>

930
00:43:55.371 --> 00:43:57.620
<v Speaker 3>you're going to hope that training will work.</v>

931
00:43:57.710 --> 00:44:01.100
<v Speaker 3>Obviously one of the armed forces conclude,</v>

932
00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:07.690
<v Speaker 3>do you have an Iq of less than 83 it's illegal to induct you into the armed</v>

933
00:44:08.031 --> 00:44:08.864
<v Speaker 3>forces.</v>

934
00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:09.260
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

935
00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:09.531
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

936
00:44:09.531 --> 00:44:10.280
<v Speaker 3>so what?</v>

937
00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:10.521
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

938
00:44:10.521 --> 00:44:12.010
<v Speaker 3>So what one in camp,</v>

939
00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:14.690
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

940
00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:15.680
<v Speaker 3>So you think about that</v>

941
00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:21.800
<v Speaker 3>among the most desperate employers in the United States,</v>

942
00:44:22.310 --> 00:44:27.310
<v Speaker 3>the conclusion has been that 10% of the population is without sufficient</v>

943
00:44:27.681 --> 00:44:32.570
<v Speaker 3>cognitive resources to do anything in a reasonably complex cognitive department</v>

944
00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:35.310
<v Speaker 3>that isn't positively counter productive</v>

945
00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:38.690
<v Speaker 3>pasture fate.</v>

946
00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:40.740
<v Speaker 3>It's a catastrophe because you know the liberal thing,</v>

947
00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:43.680
<v Speaker 3>well we're all equal.</v>

948
00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:46.110
<v Speaker 3>You can train someone to do anything.</v>

949
00:44:46.111 --> 00:44:46.381
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

950
00:44:46.381 --> 00:44:47.040
<v Speaker 3>no you can't.</v>

951
00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:47.873
<v Speaker 3>That's wrong.</v>

952
00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:48.810
<v Speaker 3>It's known is just wrong.</v>

953
00:44:49.050 --> 00:44:50.570
<v Speaker 3>It's a tongue believe want,</v>

954
00:44:50.690 --> 00:44:51.390
<v Speaker 3>want serious,</v>

955
00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:51.641
<v Speaker 3>serious,</v>

956
00:44:51.641 --> 00:44:52.170
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>

957
00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:53.440
<v Speaker 3>And then the conservative say,</v>

958
00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:56.640
<v Speaker 3>well there's a job for everybody and they just get off your lazy ass and do it.</v>

959
00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:57.370
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

960
00:44:57.370 --> 00:44:58.203
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

961
00:44:58.310 --> 00:44:58.671
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

962
00:44:58.671 --> 00:45:00.020
<v Speaker 3>that's no.</v>

963
00:45:00.021 --> 00:45:04.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you were are in the lower quintile and cognitive ability and you're</v>

964
00:45:04.831 --> 00:45:05.910
<v Speaker 3>highly conscientious,</v>

965
00:45:05.911 --> 00:45:06.744
<v Speaker 3>you work hard,</v>

966
00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:09.690
<v Speaker 3>that does increase your chances of gainful employment.</v>

967
00:45:10.170 --> 00:45:12.170
<v Speaker 3>But there's a lot,</v>

968
00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:13.380
<v Speaker 3>here's the data,</v>

969
00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:18.440
<v Speaker 3>basically people with an Iq of 90 or less and that's more like one,</v>

970
00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:20.040
<v Speaker 3>four,</v>

971
00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:21.000
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

972
00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:23.093
<v Speaker 3>They'd be more,</v>

973
00:45:23.490 --> 00:45:24.330
<v Speaker 3>probably more,</v>

974
00:45:25.490 --> 00:45:27.990
<v Speaker 3>can't read well enough to follow instructions.</v>

975
00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:30.533
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

976
00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:32.190
<v Speaker 3>I think about that cause it was like,</v>

977
00:45:32.191 --> 00:45:33.960
<v Speaker 3>I know what your definition of literacy is.</v>

978
00:45:34.170 --> 00:45:36.330
<v Speaker 3>Literacy isn't puzzling of words,</v>

979
00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:37.260
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

980
00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:40.740
<v Speaker 3>You're not literate until you're not a puzzling out words at all.</v>

981
00:45:40.741 --> 00:45:42.530
<v Speaker 3>You don't even puzzling on phrases,</v>

982
00:45:42.570 --> 00:45:42.781
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

983
00:45:42.781 --> 00:45:47.540
<v Speaker 3>You've automatized your reading ability to the point where you look at a word</v>

984
00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:48.630
<v Speaker 3>instantly read him.</v>

985
00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:53.720
<v Speaker 3>But even more so you glance at a phrase and you're not fingering hook what the</v>

986
00:45:53.761 --> 00:45:54.840
<v Speaker 3>words are.</v>

987
00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:55.860
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

988
00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:58.410
<v Speaker 3>you're interacting with the meaning of the words.</v>

989
00:45:58.620 --> 00:45:58.831
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

990
00:45:58.831 --> 00:46:00.090
<v Speaker 3>let's call that literacy.</v>

991
00:46:00.270 --> 00:46:00.870
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

992
00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:02.430
<v Speaker 3>90 Iq and below.</v>

993
00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:03.473
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

994
00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:04.830
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

995
00:46:04.830 --> 00:46:05.663
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>

996
00:46:05.810 --> 00:46:07.360
<v Speaker 3>and this is something we're point,</v>

997
00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:11.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm dwelling on this book because I'm obsessed with the idea of inequality and</v>

998
00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:14.760
<v Speaker 3>the unequal district 12 the m Mv unequal,</v>

999
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:15.601
<v Speaker 3>what we call it,</v>

1000
00:46:15.601 --> 00:46:17.190
<v Speaker 3>a distribution of creative ability.</v>

1001
00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:19.350
<v Speaker 3>It's an obsession because it's so important.</v>

1002
00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:20.250
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

1003
00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:24.060
<v Speaker 3>the thing is just the word producing a landscape around us cause increased rate</v>

1004
00:46:24.061 --> 00:46:25.290
<v Speaker 3>cognitively complex,</v>

1005
00:46:25.530 --> 00:46:25.741
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1006
00:46:25.741 --> 00:46:29.760
<v Speaker 3>Like how well are you going to do with your damn job if you can't use you or</v>

1007
00:46:29.770 --> 00:46:30.510
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>

1008
00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:33.090
<v Speaker 3>it's like using a computer that's not that easy.</v>

1009
00:46:33.091 --> 00:46:33.391
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1010
00:46:33.391 --> 00:46:34.800
<v Speaker 3>it's not a simple thing.</v>

1011
00:46:35.010 --> 00:46:36.480
<v Speaker 3>And if you're not literate,</v>

1012
00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:39.570
<v Speaker 3>then good luck to you and using your damn computer.</v>

1013
00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:42.860
<v Speaker 3>I had another client who he must have had an Iq of about,</v>

1014
00:46:43.290 --> 00:46:45.150
<v Speaker 3>I would think somewhere between 70 and 80,</v>

1015
00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:46.620
<v Speaker 3>and it was just one of many,</v>

1016
00:46:46.621 --> 00:46:47.910
<v Speaker 3>many problems he had.</v>

1017
00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:48.840
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1018
00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:53.840
<v Speaker 3>and I tried to teach him to fold up paper and put it in an envelope.</v>

1019
00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:57.300
<v Speaker 3>And I guess he had a job that required down.</v>

1020
00:46:57.310 --> 00:46:59.240
<v Speaker 3>And I watched him do that.</v>

1021
00:46:59.310 --> 00:47:02.040
<v Speaker 3>Like it's really hard to fold the paper in three and put it into an envelope</v>

1022
00:47:02.370 --> 00:47:06.470
<v Speaker 3>because the envelope is exactly the same size as the pain with walks.</v>

1023
00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:07.313
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1024
00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:08.740
<v Speaker 3>It's exactly the same size.</v>

1025
00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:10.440
<v Speaker 3>So if you have a cool twice,</v>

1026
00:47:10.441 --> 00:47:12.680
<v Speaker 3>and so if you're out by two millimeters on each fold,</v>

1027
00:47:12.681 --> 00:47:14.130
<v Speaker 3>the paper won't fit into the envelope.</v>

1028
00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:15.420
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

1029
00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:16.030
<v Speaker 3>that's not,</v>

1030
00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:17.290
<v Speaker 3>it's the same in terms of,</v>

1031
00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:19.560
<v Speaker 3>of the width of the folded paper.</v>

1032
00:47:19.561 --> 00:47:19.771
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1033
00:47:19.771 --> 00:47:22.650
<v Speaker 3>Do you have to follow exactly in three for it to fit in the envelope?</v>

1034
00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:28.100
<v Speaker 3>And if you have for what you call a volunteer job where your job is to fold</v>

1035
00:47:29.290 --> 00:47:29.730
<v Speaker 3>letters,</v>

1036
00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:30.760
<v Speaker 3>put them in envelopes,</v>

1037
00:47:31.090 --> 00:47:34.240
<v Speaker 3>you have to do that precisely and accurately at high speed.</v>

1038
00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:34.550
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1039
00:47:34.550 --> 00:47:35.383
<v Speaker 3>he couldn't do it.</v>

1040
00:47:35.650 --> 00:47:37.210
<v Speaker 3>I trained him for like 26 hours,</v>

1041
00:47:37.211 --> 00:47:40.480
<v Speaker 3>something like that and just made me sweat like really,</v>

1042
00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:41.373
<v Speaker 3>really hard on him.</v>

1043
00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:42.210
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>

1044
00:47:42.210 --> 00:47:43.730
<v Speaker 3>I mean he know he had a bit of a tremor.</v>

1045
00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:44.220
<v Speaker 3>You yeah.</v>

1046
00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:45.370
<v Speaker 3>Other problems as well.</v>

1047
00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:46.600
<v Speaker 3>And then it was so funny,</v>

1048
00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:47.530
<v Speaker 3>funny.</v>

1049
00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:51.220
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was impossible to find them a job and trying to find someone to</v>

1050
00:47:51.221 --> 00:47:51.970
<v Speaker 3>volunteer job.</v>

1051
00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:54.460
<v Speaker 3>You think so try to find someone a real job as hard.</v>

1052
00:47:54.850 --> 00:47:55.780
<v Speaker 3>You just try finding,</v>

1053
00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:57.190
<v Speaker 3>getting them on a volunteer job,</v>

1054
00:47:57.460 --> 00:47:59.590
<v Speaker 3>you have to do a police screen for example.</v>

1055
00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:01.600
<v Speaker 3>And then we have to do the paperwork for that.</v>

1056
00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:02.711
<v Speaker 3>So it was like,</v>

1057
00:48:02.711 --> 00:48:04.150
<v Speaker 3>forget that that wasn't happening.</v>

1058
00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:05.920
<v Speaker 3>And I sent them off.</v>

1059
00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:07.760
<v Speaker 3>This was an Ontario I sent them off to.</v>

1060
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.320
<v Speaker 3>There are some government agencies would be set up under the last conservative</v>

1061
00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:13.030
<v Speaker 3>already can help people do,</v>

1062
00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:13.541
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1063
00:48:13.541 --> 00:48:18.541
<v Speaker 3>we're looking for work and they have specialists hired and he told him to Oh,</v>

1064
00:48:18.610 --> 00:48:18.881
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1065
00:48:18.881 --> 00:48:20.890
<v Speaker 3>type up your resume and distributed.</v>

1066
00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:22.031
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1067
00:48:22.031 --> 00:48:22.864
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1068
00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:27.760
<v Speaker 3>That was not helpful.</v>

1069
00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:30.273
<v Speaker 3>No Tie,</v>

1070
00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:31.673
<v Speaker 3>no resume.</v>

1071
00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:33.160
<v Speaker 3>That's a big problem.</v>

1072
00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:37.090
<v Speaker 3>And so there are way more people up there like that that you think way more and</v>

1073
00:48:37.091 --> 00:48:38.770
<v Speaker 3>we do not know what to do about that.</v>

1074
00:48:39.130 --> 00:48:43.180
<v Speaker 3>And blaming it on capitalism isn't going to help because it's not the fault of</v>

1075
00:48:43.181 --> 00:48:44.014
<v Speaker 3>capitalism,</v>

1076
00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:48.600
<v Speaker 3>but also ignoring the fact that inequality exists and that people tend to stack</v>

1077
00:48:48.601 --> 00:48:53.280
<v Speaker 3>up at zero and that there are massive differences in individual productivity and</v>

1078
00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:56.830
<v Speaker 3>people don't reward it disproportionately ignoring all of that.</v>

1079
00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:58.450
<v Speaker 3>That's not gonna help either.</v>

1080
00:48:58.990 --> 00:48:59.823
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1081
00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:00.191
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1082
00:49:00.191 --> 00:49:00.360
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1083
00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:01.180
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1084
00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:02.020
<v Speaker 3>so anyway,</v>

1085
00:49:02.021 --> 00:49:04.750
<v Speaker 3>so the oldness this old guy in this world,</v>

1086
00:49:04.751 --> 00:49:05.710
<v Speaker 3>and I talked to on that,</v>

1087
00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:06.671
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

1088
00:49:06.671 --> 00:49:11.671
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't believe that I had been trained as a psychologist for like 25 years,</v>

1089
00:49:11.711 --> 00:49:12.544
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

1090
00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:15.530
<v Speaker 3>It's only 15 anyways,</v>

1091
00:49:15.690 --> 00:49:16.720
<v Speaker 3>plenty long enough.</v>

1092
00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:19.120
<v Speaker 3>And I've never heard of a premium distribution.</v>

1093
00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:21.040
<v Speaker 3>And I thought that those things were normally distributed.</v>

1094
00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:21.420
<v Speaker 3>It's an APP.</v>

1095
00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:22.960
<v Speaker 3>It's just like a seriously wrong,</v>

1096
00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:24.310
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't believe that.</v>

1097
00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:26.440
<v Speaker 3>I haven't encountered that somewhere.</v>

1098
00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:30.220
<v Speaker 3>It's still the standard speed because it's such a fundamental phenomenon.</v>

1099
00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:31.450
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1100
00:49:31.450 --> 00:49:32.021
<v Speaker 3>and his,</v>

1101
00:49:32.021 --> 00:49:32.980
<v Speaker 3>his idea was,</v>

1102
00:49:32.981 --> 00:49:33.580
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1103
00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:34.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1104
00:49:34.330 --> 00:49:37.570
<v Speaker 3>inequality amounts up and then there's revolution so well,</v>

1105
00:49:37.571 --> 00:49:38.404
<v Speaker 3>so then</v>

1106
00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:42.070
<v Speaker 3>because if you stack up at zero,</v>

1107
00:49:42.071 --> 00:49:43.070
<v Speaker 3>why not flip the board?</v>

1108
00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:43.601
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1109
00:49:43.601 --> 00:49:46.390
<v Speaker 3>if you're down to your last $10 in your playing monopoly and you're going to get</v>

1110
00:49:46.391 --> 00:49:50.900
<v Speaker 3>shocked when you lose many minds moreover and starting to games,</v>

1111
00:49:52.290 --> 00:49:54.910
<v Speaker 3>there's just no reason to participate when you're stuck at zero.</v>

1112
00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:58.990
<v Speaker 3>Even if there's a high chance of mortality by playing a new game,</v>

1113
00:49:59.230 --> 00:50:00.063
<v Speaker 3>you might as well risk,</v>

1114
00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:01.210
<v Speaker 3>especially through mail.</v>

1115
00:50:01.330 --> 00:50:05.530
<v Speaker 3>And that is exactly what characterizes the history of the human race.</v>

1116
00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:10.710
<v Speaker 3>So Chanel just book the great leveler and I've just been working my way through</v>

1117
00:50:11.321 --> 00:50:16.060
<v Speaker 3>it and I read a description and he basically came up with the same theory that</v>

1118
00:50:16.061 --> 00:50:19.420
<v Speaker 3>this whole plan of mine and come up with that inequality,</v>

1119
00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:20.390
<v Speaker 3>mountain disorderly.</v>

1120
00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:21.580
<v Speaker 3>And then there's revolutions.</v>

1121
00:50:21.581 --> 00:50:26.581
<v Speaker 3>And so Chanelle went through the data going back well as far back as you can,</v>

1122
00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:28.760
<v Speaker 3>15,000 years.</v>

1123
00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:33.440
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes even if you go back into Neolithic burial cemeteries,</v>

1124
00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:38.240
<v Speaker 3>you can get an estimate of the dollar value of the artifacts that are burdened</v>

1125
00:50:38.241 --> 00:50:42.530
<v Speaker 3>with people and then you can graph the dollar value of the artifacts and you can</v>

1126
00:50:42.531 --> 00:50:45.890
<v Speaker 3>see what sort of distribution there is and there's a pretty low distribution</v>

1127
00:50:45.891 --> 00:50:46.724
<v Speaker 3>right there.</v>

1128
00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:50.750
<v Speaker 3>You guys are like gold,</v>

1129
00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:55.040
<v Speaker 3>she think and there's like one of them in the cemetery and then there's,</v>

1130
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:55.491
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1131
00:50:55.491 --> 00:50:56.700
<v Speaker 3>a hundred people who were very good,</v>

1132
00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:58.490
<v Speaker 3>absolutely nothing and so you can,</v>

1133
00:50:58.610 --> 00:50:59.710
<v Speaker 3>you can track it there.</v>

1134
00:50:59.870 --> 00:51:02.090
<v Speaker 3>He tracked it and Quality Mark Hunter gatherers.</v>

1135
00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:03.800
<v Speaker 3>If there's no surplus,</v>

1136
00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:06.170
<v Speaker 3>there's no hunch in the pool.</v>

1137
00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:07.851
<v Speaker 3>There's still,</v>

1138
00:51:07.851 --> 00:51:11.300
<v Speaker 3>I think what would be his health was inequality of social contacts and there's</v>

1139
00:51:11.301 --> 00:51:15.410
<v Speaker 3>any quality of sexual success even when there's no surplus of material wealth,</v>

1140
00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:19.580
<v Speaker 3>so you can't get rid of inequality even if you get rid of surplus material</v>

1141
00:51:19.581 --> 00:51:20.210
<v Speaker 3>wealth.</v>

1142
00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:22.460
<v Speaker 3>Once you introduce surface material wealth,</v>

1143
00:51:22.461 --> 00:51:25.670
<v Speaker 3>which you probably want to do because otherwise everyone's living chem tomorrow.</v>

1144
00:51:25.970 --> 00:51:28.670
<v Speaker 3>Then inequality starts wrapping up in exhort.</v>

1145
00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:29.871
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1146
00:51:29.871 --> 00:51:30.680
<v Speaker 3>and that's true.</v>

1147
00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:31.513
<v Speaker 3>Now if he did it,</v>

1148
00:51:31.550 --> 00:51:33.380
<v Speaker 3>a number of very interesting analysis,</v>

1149
00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:34.670
<v Speaker 3>one question was,</v>

1150
00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:36.463
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1151
00:51:36.890 --> 00:51:40.910
<v Speaker 3>there are continuous with tends to ameliorate inequality across the centuries</v>

1152
00:51:40.911 --> 00:51:41.860
<v Speaker 3>across the IELTS,</v>

1153
00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:42.560
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1154
00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:44.390
<v Speaker 3>Because it's a fundamental problem.</v>

1155
00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:50.260
<v Speaker 3>If you analyze the relationship between the position of a government on the</v>

1156
00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:54.650
<v Speaker 3>ideological spectrum and inequality,</v>

1157
00:51:55.010 --> 00:51:56.630
<v Speaker 3>do you find any relationship?</v>

1158
00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:57.860
<v Speaker 3>And that answer is no.</v>

1159
00:51:58.490 --> 00:52:00.570
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter if it's electric government or raping.</v>

1160
00:52:00.590 --> 00:52:03.020
<v Speaker 3>Government has no effect whatsoever on inequality.</v>

1161
00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:04.910
<v Speaker 3>No one knows what to do about.</v>

1162
00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:08.750
<v Speaker 3>And so the only thing that Chanel on health,</v>

1163
00:52:08.751 --> 00:52:09.500
<v Speaker 3>we're four things,</v>

1164
00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:10.720
<v Speaker 3>and I don't know for rememberable,</v>

1165
00:52:11.290 --> 00:52:12.500
<v Speaker 3>he called them the four horsemen.</v>

1166
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:14.090
<v Speaker 3>So you can imagine what they are,</v>

1167
00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:14.900
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1168
00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:15.733
<v Speaker 3>epidemics,</v>

1169
00:52:17.290 --> 00:52:20.360
<v Speaker 3>a violent revolution war.</v>

1170
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:22.790
<v Speaker 3>And there's one other equally terrible.</v>

1171
00:52:23.210 --> 00:52:24.750
<v Speaker 3>So basically what Chanel farm goes,</v>

1172
00:52:24.780 --> 00:52:26.600
<v Speaker 3>but if you flattened everyone,</v>

1173
00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:29.510
<v Speaker 3>then you flat note,</v>

1174
00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:31.010
<v Speaker 3>I didn't put distribution.</v>

1175
00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:32.990
<v Speaker 3>But then if you start mounting up again,</v>

1176
00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:38.260
<v Speaker 3>no evidence whatsoever that any nonviolent or non catastrophic interventions</v>

1177
00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:42.110
<v Speaker 3>ameliorating inequality to any measurable degree.</v>

1178
00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:43.933
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1179
00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:44.721
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1180
00:52:44.721 --> 00:52:46.430
<v Speaker 3>so that's what Google one is about.</v>

1181
00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:47.563
<v Speaker 3>Essentially.</v>

1182
00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:54.860
<v Speaker 3>I a lot of [inaudible] things I didn't tell you are um,</v>

1183
00:52:58.460 --> 00:53:03.320
<v Speaker 3>part of the reason that I wrote it and taking some humorous flack and some not</v>

1184
00:53:03.321 --> 00:53:07.280
<v Speaker 3>so humorous flack about the claims that may not go to one because I talk about</v>

1185
00:53:07.281 --> 00:53:08.114
<v Speaker 3>lobsters and</v>

1186
00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:13.790
<v Speaker 3>the reason that I talk about lobsters this cause I was reading,</v>

1187
00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:17.030
<v Speaker 3>I read a lot of animal experimental psychology,</v>

1188
00:53:17.031 --> 00:53:17.864
<v Speaker 3>neuroscience,</v>

1189
00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:18.710
<v Speaker 3>that sort of thing,</v>

1190
00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:20.770
<v Speaker 3>basic neuroanatomy and functional neuroanatomy,</v>

1191
00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:22.783
<v Speaker 3>brain chemistry.</v>

1192
00:53:23.110 --> 00:53:28.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm very interested in the really solid biological end of psychology as well as</v>

1193
00:53:28.650 --> 00:53:32.010
<v Speaker 3>the more abstract clinical psychological theory stuff.</v>

1194
00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:35.070
<v Speaker 3>Sort of two places I've drawn the most of what I do from.</v>

1195
00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:36.113
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1196
00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:41.660
<v Speaker 3>I was reading some great papers about crustacean nervous systems 15 years ago or</v>

1197
00:53:41.671 --> 00:53:42.270
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>

1198
00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:45.190
<v Speaker 3>And crustaceans have a pretty simple nervous system compared to ours.</v>

1199
00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:49.080
<v Speaker 3>Fairly large neurons and so you can back them up pretty well.</v>

1200
00:53:49.090 --> 00:53:50.910
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like a crustacean lobster.</v>

1201
00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:53.680
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot simpler than a person neurologically speaking.</v>

1202
00:53:53.681 --> 00:53:55.740
<v Speaker 3>That's a pretty still pretty damn complicated thing.</v>

1203
00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:56.490
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1204
00:53:56.490 --> 00:54:01.010
<v Speaker 3>It believes autonomously and Hans it can recognize friend and foe.</v>

1205
00:54:01.011 --> 00:54:01.770
<v Speaker 3>It can,</v>

1206
00:54:01.770 --> 00:54:03.240
<v Speaker 3>it knows where its burrow is.</v>

1207
00:54:03.241 --> 00:54:03.770
<v Speaker 3>Like it's,</v>

1208
00:54:03.770 --> 00:54:07.290
<v Speaker 3>it's got a very wide range of complicated behaviors.</v>

1209
00:54:07.291 --> 00:54:09.780
<v Speaker 3>So you don't want to think that that officers too simple.</v>

1210
00:54:09.781 --> 00:54:10.021
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1211
00:54:10.021 --> 00:54:13.800
<v Speaker 3>they've been around for somewhere between 300 and 600 million years,</v>

1212
00:54:13.801 --> 00:54:14.300
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1213
00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:14.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1214
00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:15.690
<v Speaker 3>in one form or another.</v>

1215
00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:17.220
<v Speaker 3>So they're doing just fine.</v>

1216
00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:18.600
<v Speaker 3>Anything that lasts that long,</v>

1217
00:54:18.601 --> 00:54:19.500
<v Speaker 3>he's not stupid</v>

1218
00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:26.100
<v Speaker 3>but monsters or organize themselves into Iraq and while hierarchies,</v>

1219
00:54:26.910 --> 00:54:29.880
<v Speaker 3>the consequence of unequal distribution of resources and essentially there's no</v>

1220
00:54:29.890 --> 00:54:31.170
<v Speaker 3>difference between those two things.</v>

1221
00:54:31.171 --> 00:54:31.980
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1222
00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:33.630
<v Speaker 3>I was really interested in that because,</v>

1223
00:54:34.530 --> 00:54:34.711
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1224
00:54:34.711 --> 00:54:37.680
<v Speaker 3>because of the problem of hierarchy with problem with inequality and the problem</v>

1225
00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:40.290
<v Speaker 3>just proportionate of production and all of that and the fact that,</v>

1226
00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:45.710
<v Speaker 3>so I started to study the neurology and the neuropsychology and the neuro</v>

1227
00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:51.420
<v Speaker 3>pharmacology of the systems in our brains that govern our responses to</v>

1228
00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:52.220
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy.</v>

1229
00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:56.640
<v Speaker 3>And so this is another piece of evidence that we can't lay hierarchy or</v>

1230
00:54:56.641 --> 00:55:01.470
<v Speaker 3>inequality or disproportionality apathy of the political system because your</v>

1231
00:55:01.471 --> 00:55:05.040
<v Speaker 3>brain is so adaptive to hierarchy,</v>

1232
00:55:05.250 --> 00:55:06.630
<v Speaker 3>you cannot believe it.</v>

1233
00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:09.210
<v Speaker 3>So there are modules in your brain.</v>

1234
00:55:09.930 --> 00:55:11.100
<v Speaker 3>That's a good way of thinking about it.</v>

1235
00:55:11.250 --> 00:55:14.620
<v Speaker 3>Or more like the underlying some structure,</v>

1236
00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:19.950
<v Speaker 3>like there's the foundational substructure that's a third of a billion years</v>

1237
00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:19.951
<v Speaker 3>old,</v>

1238
00:55:19.951 --> 00:55:21.710
<v Speaker 3>which by the way is way older than treats,</v>

1239
00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:22.650
<v Speaker 3>but that's old.</v>

1240
00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:24.960
<v Speaker 3>You basically share it to the crustaceans.</v>

1241
00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:27.480
<v Speaker 3>So crustaceans have a counter in their brain,</v>

1242
00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:29.500
<v Speaker 3>you know that's an oversimplification,</v>

1243
00:55:29.610 --> 00:55:32.730
<v Speaker 3>but it will do to have a counter in their brain that tells them where they are</v>

1244
00:55:32.731 --> 00:55:33.810
<v Speaker 3>in the lobster higher.</v>

1245
00:55:34.290 --> 00:55:35.160
<v Speaker 3>And if there are one,</v>

1246
00:55:35.161 --> 00:55:37.980
<v Speaker 3>which means they're very like low level lobsters,</v>

1247
00:55:38.330 --> 00:55:42.840
<v Speaker 3>then they're kind of timid and they crunched down and they sneak around and they</v>

1248
00:55:42.841 --> 00:55:45.630
<v Speaker 3>don't buy to draw much attention to itself and they're easily startled.</v>

1249
00:55:45.810 --> 00:55:49.580
<v Speaker 3>And if they come up to another was to don't tell fuck the hell out was their,</v>

1250
00:55:49.790 --> 00:55:50.061
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>

1251
00:55:50.061 --> 00:55:55.061
<v Speaker 3>their manager is better ignored and at the bottom then dismembered and dead</v>

1252
00:55:57.220 --> 00:55:59.100
<v Speaker 3>natural cheese in general.</v>

1253
00:55:59.130 --> 00:56:01.410
<v Speaker 3>And then the lobsters as they move up,</v>

1254
00:56:01.411 --> 00:56:01.801
<v Speaker 3>say 10,</v>

1255
00:56:01.801 --> 00:56:02.521
<v Speaker 3>10 strata,</v>

1256
00:56:02.521 --> 00:56:05.250
<v Speaker 3>lost your hierarchy to get stretch out.</v>

1257
00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:06.810
<v Speaker 3>And they all cry more and more space.</v>

1258
00:56:06.811 --> 00:56:09.840
<v Speaker 3>So like two lobsters of equivalent size,</v>

1259
00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:12.190
<v Speaker 3>one who's a number one law one,</v>

1260
00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:13.290
<v Speaker 3>he's number 10 in Gloucester,</v>

1261
00:56:13.530 --> 00:56:17.030
<v Speaker 3>will occupy different amounts of area because the number one Gloucester</v>

1262
00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:17.661
<v Speaker 3>stretches out.</v>

1263
00:56:17.661 --> 00:56:18.930
<v Speaker 3>It looks bigger than he is,</v>

1264
00:56:18.931 --> 00:56:19.680
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

1265
00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:21.780
<v Speaker 3>because he's confident because he's won all the time.</v>

1266
00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:23.010
<v Speaker 3>Whereas the number 10 blogs,</v>

1267
00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:24.070
<v Speaker 3>his French is down.</v>

1268
00:56:24.550 --> 00:56:28.990
<v Speaker 3>And so I thought that was very interesting because I knew that there's an</v>

1269
00:56:28.991 --> 00:56:33.991
<v Speaker 3>analogy between human depression and low physician in primary dominant car</v>

1270
00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:35.313
<v Speaker 3>instructors.</v>

1271
00:56:35.770 --> 00:56:36.131
<v Speaker 3>So on.</v>

1272
00:56:36.131 --> 00:56:40.690
<v Speaker 3>The analogy seems to be that what happens when you get depressed?</v>

1273
00:56:40.990 --> 00:56:41.823
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1274
00:56:41.860 --> 00:56:43.410
<v Speaker 3>sometimes if you're both status,</v>

1275
00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:44.263
<v Speaker 3>you're depressed.</v>

1276
00:56:44.620 --> 00:56:49.620
<v Speaker 3>But sometimes if you're depressed you act like the low status even though you're</v>

1277
00:56:49.841 --> 00:56:50.470
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>

1278
00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:52.480
<v Speaker 3>And that's not a bad definition of depression.</v>

1279
00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:56.710
<v Speaker 3>And it's actually a good way of thinking about what's happening functionally in</v>

1280
00:56:57.040 --> 00:56:57.873
<v Speaker 3>a neuro chemically.</v>

1281
00:56:58.330 --> 00:56:59.080
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1282
00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:02.580
<v Speaker 3>and then I was more so that was interesting and I found out.</v>

1283
00:57:02.581 --> 00:57:04.810
<v Speaker 3>But at the same time that in the lobster,</v>

1284
00:57:04.811 --> 00:57:08.140
<v Speaker 3>the neurochemical Serotonin is a fundamental chemical.</v>

1285
00:57:08.350 --> 00:57:09.730
<v Speaker 3>The serotonergic system is very,</v>

1286
00:57:09.731 --> 00:57:10.361
<v Speaker 3>very ancient.</v>

1287
00:57:10.361 --> 00:57:11.620
<v Speaker 3>And when you're in Utero,</v>

1288
00:57:11.621 --> 00:57:12.850
<v Speaker 3>when your brain is getting set up,</v>

1289
00:57:12.851 --> 00:57:17.410
<v Speaker 3>the serotonin system sets it up and it regulates your Hoshin Serotonin.</v>

1290
00:57:17.411 --> 00:57:22.120
<v Speaker 3>So in some sense what it does is determine how much positive emotion you feel</v>

1291
00:57:22.121 --> 00:57:24.310
<v Speaker 3>compared to how much negative emotions and no,</v>

1292
00:57:24.311 --> 00:57:25.720
<v Speaker 3>those are separate systems by the way.</v>

1293
00:57:25.721 --> 00:57:28.780
<v Speaker 3>So happiness is not the opposite of sadness.</v>

1294
00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:33.520
<v Speaker 3>There's a system for happiness and there's a system for sadness and they inhibit</v>

1295
00:57:33.521 --> 00:57:33.851
<v Speaker 3>each other,</v>

1296
00:57:33.851 --> 00:57:35.140
<v Speaker 3>but it's not one system.</v>

1297
00:57:35.140 --> 00:57:39.190
<v Speaker 3>So you can have very high levels of negative emotion and very high levels of</v>

1298
00:57:39.191 --> 00:57:39.881
<v Speaker 3>positive emotion.</v>

1299
00:57:39.881 --> 00:57:43.700
<v Speaker 3>So if you pick a big tribe and you read behind neuroticism and you're really</v>

1300
00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:44.620
<v Speaker 3>high in extroversion,</v>

1301
00:57:44.890 --> 00:57:47.680
<v Speaker 3>that you're someone who has very high levels of big and promotion and very high</v>

1302
00:57:47.681 --> 00:57:48.680
<v Speaker 3>end up with a positive voltage.</v>

1303
00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:49.600
<v Speaker 3>So that the APP,</v>

1304
00:57:49.930 --> 00:57:54.410
<v Speaker 3>what what Serotonin does is that as your serotonin levels increase,</v>

1305
00:57:54.970 --> 00:57:59.670
<v Speaker 3>your sensitivity to negative emotion increases and your sensitivity deposit</v>

1306
00:57:59.710 --> 00:58:01.690
<v Speaker 3>emotion decreases.</v>

1307
00:58:02.110 --> 00:58:04.470
<v Speaker 3>And so people hate that and no wonder,</v>

1308
00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:04.720
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1309
00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:09.190
<v Speaker 3>Like person hate that because all the pleasure and hope goes away and all the</v>

1310
00:58:09.191 --> 00:58:10.720
<v Speaker 3>pain and the anxiety is magnified.</v>

1311
00:58:10.990 --> 00:58:14.500
<v Speaker 3>And that's proportionate to your position and the dominance harder.</v>

1312
00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:16.810
<v Speaker 3>So as you move up your serotonin levels,</v>

1313
00:58:16.811 --> 00:58:17.930
<v Speaker 3>increasing stress out,</v>

1314
00:58:17.931 --> 00:58:22.710
<v Speaker 3>can you stand tall and proud of to say and you're more susceptible deposit</v>

1315
00:58:22.730 --> 00:58:25.090
<v Speaker 3>motion hope and less susceptible to negative emotion.</v>

1316
00:58:25.300 --> 00:58:27.580
<v Speaker 3>And as you plummet down the dominance hierarchy,</v>

1317
00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:32.760
<v Speaker 3>which happens if you're defeated or humiliated or embarrassed or or promotion</v>

1318
00:58:32.810 --> 00:58:35.110
<v Speaker 3>work that you were expecting our work,</v>

1319
00:58:35.230 --> 00:58:39.130
<v Speaker 3>well you've run into one of those situations who life where things fall apart on</v>

1320
00:58:39.131 --> 00:58:44.050
<v Speaker 3>you serve who levels fall through droops and your negative emotion starts to get</v>

1321
00:58:44.051 --> 00:58:44.884
<v Speaker 3>out of control.</v>

1322
00:58:45.220 --> 00:58:46.053
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1323
00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:51.440
<v Speaker 3>and the fact that that it's a staggering thing that that physio chemical</v>

1324
00:58:52.721 --> 00:58:56.690
<v Speaker 3>response has be maintained for third of appealing ears.</v>

1325
00:58:57.780 --> 00:58:57.971
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1326
00:58:57.971 --> 00:58:58.804
<v Speaker 3>And I'm sure as you,</v>

1327
00:58:58.830 --> 00:59:02.970
<v Speaker 3>and also see it also helps you understand why people don't like humiliation and</v>

1328
00:59:02.980 --> 00:59:04.540
<v Speaker 3>lots of people don't like to public speak.</v>

1329
00:59:04.541 --> 00:59:08.310
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the most common fears work on then the fear of death by the way.</v>

1330
00:59:08.650 --> 00:59:11.690
<v Speaker 3>And the reason that we don't like to public speak is because while you're,</v>

1331
00:59:11.740 --> 00:59:16.740
<v Speaker 3>you're in front of a hierarchical group and exposed to the evaluation of the</v>

1332
00:59:16.781 --> 00:59:21.740
<v Speaker 3>group and people don't like that and well just explained why people don't like</v>

1333
00:59:21.741 --> 00:59:23.960
<v Speaker 3>it when your belief systems are challenged either.</v>

1334
00:59:24.450 --> 00:59:26.450
<v Speaker 3>And I thought about that for a long,</v>

1335
00:59:26.451 --> 00:59:26.841
<v Speaker 3>long,</v>

1336
00:59:26.841 --> 00:59:27.674
<v Speaker 3>long time.</v>

1337
00:59:28.070 --> 00:59:31.460
<v Speaker 3>And there's one second logical theory that's called terror management theory.</v>

1338
00:59:31.461 --> 00:59:36.170
<v Speaker 3>The idea is that you have a belief system to make sense of things in the world</v>

1339
00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:38.600
<v Speaker 3>and as long as it remains intact,</v>

1340
00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:40.840
<v Speaker 3>then Andrew can make sense of things in the rules,</v>

1341
00:59:40.841 --> 00:59:44.710
<v Speaker 3>then you don't feel an overwhelming sense of existential anxiety.</v>

1342
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:46.760
<v Speaker 3>Some one comes along Marcus,</v>

1343
00:59:46.761 --> 00:59:50.570
<v Speaker 3>about the accidents of your belief system and you don't have an explanation for</v>

1344
00:59:50.571 --> 00:59:52.430
<v Speaker 3>things that you get overwhelmed by anxiety.</v>

1345
00:59:52.610 --> 00:59:55.080
<v Speaker 3>And that's why people play for the belief systems.</v>

1346
00:59:55.100 --> 00:59:56.060
<v Speaker 3>But I have a,</v>

1347
00:59:56.760 --> 00:59:59.040
<v Speaker 3>and that is that um,</v>

1348
00:59:59.690 --> 01:00:00.523
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

1349
01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:02.840
<v Speaker 3>your competence like okay,</v>

1350
01:00:02.841 --> 01:00:07.710
<v Speaker 3>so let's say by we university professor hypothetically that means on the slotted</v>

1351
01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:10.340
<v Speaker 3>into a dominant hierarchy ended up pretty high levels.</v>

1352
01:00:10.370 --> 01:00:12.200
<v Speaker 3>Like being a university professors.</v>

1353
01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:12.770
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

1354
01:00:12.770 --> 01:00:13.300
<v Speaker 3>good job.</v>

1355
01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:13.530
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1356
01:00:13.530 --> 01:00:15.170
<v Speaker 3>because it's very secure,</v>

1357
01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:18.020
<v Speaker 3>which is a good thing and it's very prestigious.</v>

1358
01:00:18.110 --> 01:00:22.490
<v Speaker 3>So that's also a good thing now so I can see myself in that hierarchy.</v>

1359
01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:24.260
<v Speaker 3>And was your number two or number three position,</v>

1360
01:00:24.261 --> 01:00:27.470
<v Speaker 3>whatever it happens to be somewhere approximately close to the top.</v>

1361
01:00:27.770 --> 01:00:32.770
<v Speaker 3>And I have a claim hold that position now I'm a moral claim on that position and</v>

1362
01:00:34.310 --> 01:00:35.143
<v Speaker 3>hypothetically,</v>

1363
01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:36.740
<v Speaker 3>and it's a position that other people want.</v>

1364
01:00:36.741 --> 01:00:37.700
<v Speaker 3>So it's very competitive.</v>

1365
01:00:37.870 --> 01:00:42.500
<v Speaker 3>It's any attempt to find a high status job.</v>

1366
01:00:42.530 --> 01:00:46.970
<v Speaker 3>It's extraordinarily competitive and it's not surprising because the prestigious</v>

1367
01:00:46.971 --> 01:00:47.804
<v Speaker 3>positions,</v>

1368
01:00:47.870 --> 01:00:51.550
<v Speaker 3>they're secure and they're economically advantageous so and they're scarce.</v>

1369
01:00:51.551 --> 01:00:52.790
<v Speaker 3>So of course there's competition.</v>

1370
01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:58.420
<v Speaker 3>So hypothetically you win some sort of contest in order to deal with that</v>

1371
01:00:58.701 --> 01:01:00.060
<v Speaker 3>position also.</v>

1372
01:01:00.070 --> 01:01:01.370
<v Speaker 3>What would the content be?</v>

1373
01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:02.420
<v Speaker 3>It might be,</v>

1374
01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:07.600
<v Speaker 3>well I know enough to justify being put in that position when someone stands up</v>

1375
01:01:08.841 --> 01:01:13.190
<v Speaker 3>and the question period say it puts me on the spot and indicates that my</v>

1376
01:01:13.191 --> 01:01:17.210
<v Speaker 3>knowledge about something is less thorough than I might have been claiming.</v>

1377
01:01:17.450 --> 01:01:18.021
<v Speaker 3>You might say,</v>

1378
01:01:18.021 --> 01:01:19.970
<v Speaker 3>well that's shaking.</v>

1379
01:01:19.971 --> 01:01:22.490
<v Speaker 3>My belief structure could more accurately.</v>

1380
01:01:22.491 --> 01:01:24.260
<v Speaker 3>I think Britney saves that.</v>

1381
01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:29.380
<v Speaker 3>We can my moral claim to the position in the actual hierarchy that actually</v>

1382
01:01:31.641 --> 01:01:35.300
<v Speaker 3>protects me rather than the belief system that I use to construe the world.</v>

1383
01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:35.691
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1384
01:01:35.691 --> 01:01:38.480
<v Speaker 3>like being in an actual hierarchy,</v>

1385
01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:42.670
<v Speaker 3>slotted near the talk isn't only psychologically adventageous,</v>

1386
01:01:42.671 --> 01:01:43.100
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1387
01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:44.810
<v Speaker 3>It's actually advantageous.</v>

1388
01:01:45.110 --> 01:01:46.730
<v Speaker 3>It actually is more secure.</v>

1389
01:01:46.731 --> 01:01:50.120
<v Speaker 3>It actually is Bernard's economic benefits that come along with it.</v>

1390
01:01:50.270 --> 01:01:51.770
<v Speaker 3>It is a prestigious position.</v>

1391
01:01:51.950 --> 01:01:53.750
<v Speaker 3>None of that's merely psychological.</v>

1392
01:01:54.590 --> 01:01:57.350
<v Speaker 3>And so people don't like having their competence,</v>

1393
01:01:57.410 --> 01:02:02.410
<v Speaker 3>their incompetence displayed in public before their peers because it threatens</v>

1394
01:02:02.731 --> 01:02:06.380
<v Speaker 3>their [inaudible] to their position in the hierarchy and that position</v>

1395
01:02:06.410 --> 01:02:07.820
<v Speaker 3>stabilizes their emotions.</v>

1396
01:02:08.770 --> 01:02:11.450
<v Speaker 3>And so that took about 25 years to figure out</v>

1397
01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:15.950
<v Speaker 3>a moral,</v>

1398
01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:19.800
<v Speaker 3>I guess the moral of the story is the point of the story and point of the story</v>

1399
01:02:19.801 --> 01:02:23.820
<v Speaker 3>is the direction of the story and the direction of the story has a moral</v>

1400
01:02:23.821 --> 01:02:28.130
<v Speaker 3>injunction because I'm more on junction is go back way instead of that one.</v>

1401
01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:28.380
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1402
01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:29.220
<v Speaker 3>Or maybe it's,</v>

1403
01:02:29.550 --> 01:02:31.650
<v Speaker 3>well it turns out that way is up.</v>

1404
01:02:31.830 --> 01:02:35.250
<v Speaker 3>That's actually more of a moral of junk because my big ball and you'd like to</v>

1405
01:02:35.251 --> 01:02:36.084
<v Speaker 3>move up.</v>

1406
01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:36.780
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1407
01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:38.020
<v Speaker 3>maybe you want to move down or who?</v>

1408
01:02:38.021 --> 01:02:39.030
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't recommend that.</v>

1409
01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:43.120
<v Speaker 3>But when people do a mic down sometimes like the kid in Florida yesterday,</v>

1410
01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:44.700
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1411
01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:48.990
<v Speaker 3>who was eating very seriously at doubt and so people doing it down,</v>

1412
01:02:48.991 --> 01:02:51.090
<v Speaker 3>but you might think that aiming it up is better,</v>

1413
01:02:51.270 --> 01:02:52.920
<v Speaker 3>but you might not know which way up there.</v>

1414
01:02:52.930 --> 01:02:57.750
<v Speaker 3>I said the moral of the story is a point or two which way is up and each of the</v>

1415
01:02:57.810 --> 01:03:02.100
<v Speaker 3>rules in my book is a pointer to which way is up and you know they're,</v>

1416
01:03:02.550 --> 01:03:04.020
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't say the rules themselves,</v>

1417
01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:05.063
<v Speaker 3>particularly</v>

1418
01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:08.100
<v Speaker 3>unique or original.</v>

1419
01:03:08.190 --> 01:03:09.810
<v Speaker 3>I actually try to make them,</v>

1420
01:03:09.870 --> 01:03:10.540
<v Speaker 3>I know unique,</v>

1421
01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:15.540
<v Speaker 3>original and tried to make them rock solid and obvious and then explain why they</v>

1422
01:03:16.561 --> 01:03:20.850
<v Speaker 3>were so necessary because well generally speaking,</v>

1423
01:03:20.851 --> 01:03:24.000
<v Speaker 3>if something sort of self care then you don't have much of a rationale for it.</v>

1424
01:03:24.030 --> 01:03:24.631
<v Speaker 3>You don't need it.</v>

1425
01:03:24.631 --> 01:03:24.961
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1426
01:03:24.961 --> 01:03:29.490
<v Speaker 3>well everyone knows that like well it turns out you don't really know what you</v>

1427
01:03:29.491 --> 01:03:31.140
<v Speaker 3>just accept it because everyone else does.</v>

1428
01:03:31.141 --> 01:03:32.310
<v Speaker 3>And that's usually good enough.</v>

1429
01:03:33.210 --> 01:03:35.130
<v Speaker 3>So when in in 12 rules,</v>

1430
01:03:35.131 --> 01:03:36.640
<v Speaker 3>one of the things I suggested plus,</v>

1431
01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:40.440
<v Speaker 3>well you've got this problem of hierarchy,</v>

1432
01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:44.460
<v Speaker 3>right and the really catastrophic consequences of failure and the</v>

1433
01:03:44.461 --> 01:03:48.870
<v Speaker 3>disproportionate advantages of success and the stress that that puts on social</v>

1434
01:03:48.871 --> 01:03:50.070
<v Speaker 3>systems might say,</v>

1435
01:03:50.071 --> 01:03:53.940
<v Speaker 3>well we'll go for radical egalitarianism but there's no evidence that that works</v>

1436
01:03:53.941 --> 01:03:56.580
<v Speaker 3>and plenty of evidence that it has catastrophic outcomes.</v>

1437
01:03:56.910 --> 01:04:00.390
<v Speaker 3>And plus if you get rid of hierarchies that you don't have any op cause one of</v>

1438
01:04:00.391 --> 01:04:02.220
<v Speaker 3>the advantages of a hierarchy as it says,</v>

1439
01:04:02.221 --> 01:04:05.190
<v Speaker 3>well a is better than B and you might say,</v>

1440
01:04:05.191 --> 01:04:06.590
<v Speaker 3>well if a is better than me,</v>

1441
01:04:06.591 --> 01:04:10.170
<v Speaker 3>then some people are better at a then at the end then you get into quality.</v>

1442
01:04:10.410 --> 01:04:13.080
<v Speaker 3>But if nothing is better than anything else than what the hell,</v>

1443
01:04:13.081 --> 01:04:13.470
<v Speaker 3>what do you,</v>

1444
01:04:13.470 --> 01:04:14.303
<v Speaker 3>why live,</v>

1445
01:04:15.270 --> 01:04:15.990
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1446
01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:17.590
<v Speaker 3>You've got to know you the way in.</v>

1447
01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:20.400
<v Speaker 3>If one thing is new better than another,</v>

1448
01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:24.150
<v Speaker 3>then you're not mistaking depressed because he wants to just sit there and age.</v>

1449
01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:25.543
<v Speaker 3>You know</v>

1450
01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:27.930
<v Speaker 3>what the Hell's the difference?</v>

1451
01:04:28.510 --> 01:04:29.850
<v Speaker 3>If everything is equal,</v>

1452
01:04:29.851 --> 01:04:32.580
<v Speaker 3>then there's no impetus for action.</v>

1453
01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:34.770
<v Speaker 3>This is actually a technical truth by the way,</v>

1454
01:04:34.771 --> 01:04:38.730
<v Speaker 3>because we know how positive emotion systems work.</v>

1455
01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:40.110
<v Speaker 3>We know a lot about them.</v>

1456
01:04:40.111 --> 01:04:43.260
<v Speaker 3>And I think the person who did the best work on that was Jeffrey Gray who wrote</v>

1457
01:04:43.261 --> 01:04:44.470
<v Speaker 3>a book called the neuro psychology.</v>

1458
01:04:44.471 --> 01:04:45.031
<v Speaker 3>My anxiety,</v>

1459
01:04:45.031 --> 01:04:46.740
<v Speaker 3>which is on my reading list on my website,</v>

1460
01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:47.910
<v Speaker 3>but brilliant book,</v>

1461
01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:50.400
<v Speaker 3>it only take you about six months,</v>

1462
01:04:50.401 --> 01:04:52.140
<v Speaker 3>a four hour days to read.</v>

1463
01:04:53.850 --> 01:04:58.850
<v Speaker 3>He must've read 3000 scientific papers to write that book.</v>

1464
01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:00.480
<v Speaker 3>And not only can he read them,</v>

1465
01:05:00.570 --> 01:05:03.810
<v Speaker 3>he actually read them and the understood them.</v>

1466
01:05:04.540 --> 01:05:08.850
<v Speaker 3>You actually took the time to understand that many synthesize them and then he</v>

1467
01:05:08.851 --> 01:05:10.470
<v Speaker 3>did an accurately and that's like,</v>

1468
01:05:10.471 --> 01:05:11.520
<v Speaker 3>that just never happens.</v>

1469
01:05:11.790 --> 01:05:14.130
<v Speaker 3>And so you just,</v>

1470
01:05:14.131 --> 01:05:19.131
<v Speaker 3>neuropsychology of anxiety has 20 years of off rate geniuses work condensed into</v>

1471
01:05:19.781 --> 01:05:23.740
<v Speaker 3>300 pages and it's not something you can just pick up and scan through because</v>

1472
01:05:23.950 --> 01:05:26.260
<v Speaker 3>every sentence is a learning experience.</v>

1473
01:05:26.261 --> 01:05:29.770
<v Speaker 3>But Ray did a really nice job back in 1982.</v>

1474
01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:30.910
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1475
01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:32.920
<v Speaker 3>and things have changed to some degree since then,</v>

1476
01:05:32.921 --> 01:05:36.370
<v Speaker 3>but no law in laying out what the function of the positive emotional system</v>

1477
01:05:36.371 --> 01:05:39.490
<v Speaker 3>while he was discussing the neurological basis of anxiety.</v>

1478
01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:44.820
<v Speaker 3>It turns out that most of the positive emotion that people experience is not as</v>

1479
01:05:44.861 --> 01:05:47.260
<v Speaker 3>a consequence of attaining a goal.</v>

1480
01:05:48.250 --> 01:05:50.350
<v Speaker 3>It's more a consequence of looking.</v>

1481
01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:54.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm noticing that you're moving forward towards your goal that you desire.</v>

1482
01:05:54.730 --> 01:05:55.720
<v Speaker 3>So we have a system,</v>

1483
01:05:56.490 --> 01:06:00.280
<v Speaker 3>it's called Conservatory reward system that makes you feel good when you get</v>

1484
01:06:00.281 --> 01:06:00.970
<v Speaker 3>something you want.</v>

1485
01:06:00.970 --> 01:06:02.050
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

1486
01:06:02.051 --> 01:06:05.170
<v Speaker 3>if you sit down at Thanksgiving and you eat the Turkey afterwards,</v>

1487
01:06:05.171 --> 01:06:07.000
<v Speaker 3>you're feeling satisfied.</v>

1488
01:06:07.270 --> 01:06:08.650
<v Speaker 3>So it's the satisfaction system.</v>

1489
01:06:08.830 --> 01:06:11.650
<v Speaker 3>You're fitting satisfied and that's a kind of good,</v>

1490
01:06:12.130 --> 01:06:13.540
<v Speaker 3>but it's not excited,</v>

1491
01:06:13.541 --> 01:06:14.261
<v Speaker 3>hopeful ending,</v>

1492
01:06:14.261 --> 01:06:15.100
<v Speaker 3>engaged.</v>

1493
01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:17.600
<v Speaker 3>That's a whole different car and that's a better seventh.</v>

1494
01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:18.850
<v Speaker 3>One of the motivations,</v>

1495
01:06:19.030 --> 01:06:22.510
<v Speaker 3>and we know about because people preferentially like drugs that these,</v>

1496
01:06:22.511 --> 01:06:26.310
<v Speaker 3>that effect cocaine and amphetamine methamphetamine does that.</v>

1497
01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:27.400
<v Speaker 3>Alcohol does that.</v>

1498
01:06:27.401 --> 01:06:28.960
<v Speaker 3>If you're predisposed to alcoholism,</v>

1499
01:06:29.350 --> 01:06:32.380
<v Speaker 3>it activates the second motor exploratory system.</v>

1500
01:06:32.381 --> 01:06:34.450
<v Speaker 3>It's dope and dope at the near GP medium.</v>

1501
01:06:34.510 --> 01:06:39.010
<v Speaker 3>That's the dopamine system and the drugs that people really like don't make you</v>

1502
01:06:39.011 --> 01:06:40.120
<v Speaker 3>feel satisfied.</v>

1503
01:06:40.121 --> 01:06:42.520
<v Speaker 3>So like do you sit around after you've had a giant Turkey?</v>

1504
01:06:42.790 --> 01:06:46.480
<v Speaker 3>It make you feel like you're doing something that makes like life worth living.</v>

1505
01:06:46.690 --> 01:06:50.010
<v Speaker 3>And that's what cocaine does even know cooking doesn't make like worthy of</v>

1506
01:06:51.180 --> 01:06:53.070
<v Speaker 3>provides that the simulation.</v>

1507
01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:54.650
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1508
01:06:54.650 --> 01:06:56.980
<v Speaker 3>so the upshot of that is,</v>

1509
01:06:57.130 --> 01:07:00.520
<v Speaker 3>and this is a theme that is woven throat 12 rules for life,</v>

1510
01:07:00.521 --> 01:07:02.500
<v Speaker 3>is that no goal,</v>

1511
01:07:02.530 --> 01:07:03.220
<v Speaker 3>no aim,</v>

1512
01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:03.970
<v Speaker 3>no op,</v>

1513
01:07:03.970 --> 01:07:04.960
<v Speaker 3>no hierarchy,</v>

1514
01:07:05.170 --> 01:07:06.160
<v Speaker 3>no positive emotion.</v>

1515
01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:08.080
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>

1516
01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:10.860
<v Speaker 3>that's something that we also were just need to keep in mind cause hierarchies</v>

1517
01:07:10.861 --> 01:07:12.190
<v Speaker 3>have this terrible price strength,</v>

1518
01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:14.770
<v Speaker 3>which is the people stock up with water by.</v>

1519
01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:16.660
<v Speaker 3>If there isn't a hierarchy of value,</v>

1520
01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:18.490
<v Speaker 3>so that one thing is better than another.</v>

1521
01:07:18.970 --> 01:07:21.390
<v Speaker 3>Well what the hell is all your striking the floor?</v>

1522
01:07:21.970 --> 01:07:24.430
<v Speaker 3>And I think that it's actually even worse than that.</v>

1523
01:07:24.490 --> 01:07:26.710
<v Speaker 3>And this is another motif that could go to,</v>

1524
01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:29.020
<v Speaker 3>like people often ask,</v>

1525
01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:31.090
<v Speaker 3>does life have a meaning?</v>

1526
01:07:31.690 --> 01:07:33.130
<v Speaker 3>And that's actually a fairly chill,</v>

1527
01:07:33.131 --> 01:07:38.131
<v Speaker 3>formulated question because the answer to that is self evidently yes.</v>

1528
01:07:39.370 --> 01:07:40.210
<v Speaker 3>What's the meaning?</v>

1529
01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:42.490
<v Speaker 3>Pain and anxiety.</v>

1530
01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:44.313
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1531
01:07:44.350 --> 01:07:46.610
<v Speaker 3>And the reason I use those to self evidence,</v>

1532
01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:49.900
<v Speaker 3>because even if you're a cynic,</v>

1533
01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:51.430
<v Speaker 3>like a nihilistic,</v>

1534
01:07:51.431 --> 01:07:55.720
<v Speaker 3>sending a hopeless nihilistic Sinek that life has no meaning,</v>

1535
01:07:56.220 --> 01:08:01.120
<v Speaker 3>it's like you're wrong because hold as you will to that theory,</v>

1536
01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:05.830
<v Speaker 3>you will still be in pain and anxious and he might say,</v>

1537
01:08:05.831 --> 01:08:06.760
<v Speaker 3>well that's not a meaning.</v>

1538
01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:11.260
<v Speaker 3>It's like yeah actually it is just happens to be negative,</v>

1539
01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:12.970
<v Speaker 3>but it's not neutral.</v>

1540
01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:14.493
<v Speaker 3>It's a meaning.</v>

1541
01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:20.140
<v Speaker 3>And so the question life meaning is more like does life have meaning in spite of</v>

1542
01:08:23.001 --> 01:08:23.834
<v Speaker 3>its suffering?</v>

1543
01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:27.020
<v Speaker 3>And the answer that seems to be,</v>

1544
01:08:29.030 --> 01:08:30.320
<v Speaker 3>well it depends what you aim at</v>

1545
01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:34.430
<v Speaker 3>and if you don't need anything then no is the answer.</v>

1546
01:08:35.450 --> 01:08:38.440
<v Speaker 3>And then the next dance was something like you have to him.</v>

1547
01:08:38.441 --> 01:08:43.441
<v Speaker 3>And something that's so valuable that the pursuit of it justifies the suffering</v>

1548
01:08:46.131 --> 01:08:46.964
<v Speaker 3>and the anxiety.</v>

1549
01:08:47.750 --> 01:08:50.780
<v Speaker 3>And so that actually means you need a pretty damn steep hierarchy of values.</v>

1550
01:08:50.990 --> 01:08:54.350
<v Speaker 3>Some things have to be way better than other things because otherwise there's</v>

1551
01:08:54.351 --> 01:08:59.351
<v Speaker 3>not enough force in their pursuit to produce enough engagement in life to</v>

1552
01:09:00.141 --> 01:09:02.900
<v Speaker 3>overcome dot catastrophe of life.</v>

1553
01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:04.281
<v Speaker 3>And you might say,</v>

1554
01:09:04.281 --> 01:09:06.530
<v Speaker 3>well why we're coming to catastrophe your life?</v>

1555
01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:08.360
<v Speaker 3>Well there's a bunch of answers to that.</v>

1556
01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:13.390
<v Speaker 3>One is well you'll be in your own little hell if you don't and so unless that's</v>

1557
01:09:13.581 --> 01:09:16.430
<v Speaker 3>what you want and then I wouldn't recommend it,</v>

1558
01:09:16.670 --> 01:09:20.690
<v Speaker 3>but that's only the beginning of things and this is something 12 was like cause</v>

1559
01:09:20.691 --> 01:09:21.560
<v Speaker 3>in some way a very,</v>

1560
01:09:21.561 --> 01:09:22.740
<v Speaker 3>very dark book.</v>

1561
01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:25.730
<v Speaker 3>Like I make a very chapter six for example,</v>

1562
01:09:25.731 --> 01:09:27.770
<v Speaker 3>which is put your house in perfect order before you,</v>

1563
01:09:27.870 --> 01:09:28.703
<v Speaker 3>the size of the world.</v>

1564
01:09:28.910 --> 01:09:31.940
<v Speaker 3>There's a full explanation of what happened yesterday in Florida.</v>

1565
01:09:33.130 --> 01:09:33.380
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1566
01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:37.490
<v Speaker 3>because I spend a lot of time to try to figure out just exactly how is it that</v>

1567
01:09:37.491 --> 01:09:42.491
<v Speaker 3>you have to think for several months or years in your Bruning obsession about</v>

1568
01:09:43.251 --> 01:09:46.880
<v Speaker 3>the structure of the world before you decided that it's really a good idea to</v>

1569
01:09:46.881 --> 01:09:48.260
<v Speaker 3>pick up a 70 on a rifle,</v>

1570
01:09:48.290 --> 01:09:51.710
<v Speaker 3>semi automatic rifle and going into high school and shoot a bunch of innocent</v>

1571
01:09:51.711 --> 01:09:53.120
<v Speaker 3>people or maybe worse.</v>

1572
01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:55.790
<v Speaker 3>You'd go in Connecticut and it in high school.</v>

1573
01:09:55.791 --> 01:10:00.000
<v Speaker 3>Kids who shoot it's elementary school kids just to put that extra Marin.</v>

1574
01:10:00.001 --> 01:10:03.680
<v Speaker 3>She Cherry on top of your delightful confection of evil,</v>

1575
01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:04.221
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1576
01:10:04.221 --> 01:10:05.630
<v Speaker 3>Because high school kids,</v>

1577
01:10:05.631 --> 01:10:07.760
<v Speaker 3>but they'd probably done at least something wrong.</v>

1578
01:10:08.030 --> 01:10:09.320
<v Speaker 3>It was elementary school kids,</v>

1579
01:10:09.321 --> 01:10:12.050
<v Speaker 3>they're getting as close the innocence as you could cost cause damage.</v>

1580
01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:17.350
<v Speaker 3>And so if you're particularly negatively inclined and you have your reasons,</v>

1581
01:10:18.311 --> 01:10:21.110
<v Speaker 3>then the most innocent target is the most attractive.</v>

1582
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:23.240
<v Speaker 3>And so if you want to understand that,</v>

1583
01:10:23.390 --> 01:10:24.440
<v Speaker 3>and you probably should,</v>

1584
01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:25.820
<v Speaker 3>even though you really don't want it,</v>

1585
01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:30.060
<v Speaker 3>then you can read chapter six because I've tried very hard to put myself in hand</v>

1586
01:10:30.061 --> 01:10:31.490
<v Speaker 3>and people who do that sort of thing,</v>

1587
01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:33.330
<v Speaker 3>and I understand why they do it.</v>

1588
01:10:33.370 --> 01:10:38.060
<v Speaker 3>And part of it is a live lives that are nothing but pain and anxiety.</v>

1589
01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:40.340
<v Speaker 3>And there's all sorts of reasons for that.</v>

1590
01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:41.690
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it's bad luck,</v>

1591
01:10:41.691 --> 01:10:44.030
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it's neural chemical accidents,</v>

1592
01:10:44.031 --> 01:10:48.880
<v Speaker 3>sometimes until health is often tied up with a fair edit,</v>

1593
01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:51.920
<v Speaker 3>let's call it moral psychopathology.</v>

1594
01:10:52.190 --> 01:10:55.700
<v Speaker 3>They don't see any positive meaning in life that outweighs the catastrophe of</v>

1595
01:10:55.701 --> 01:10:59.420
<v Speaker 3>life and then become normally immersed in their own little hell,</v>

1596
01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:00.560
<v Speaker 3>which is bad enough.</v>

1597
01:11:00.890 --> 01:11:05.840
<v Speaker 3>But eventually stewing in that hell leads them to the inevitable conclusion that</v>

1598
01:11:05.841 --> 01:11:10.700
<v Speaker 3>distributing it as widely as possible with as much may have as possible with as</v>

1599
01:11:10.701 --> 01:11:15.180
<v Speaker 3>much evil intent as can be managed in the shortest possible period of time is</v>

1600
01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:20.160
<v Speaker 3>definitely the right thing to do and so the thing is is that your food doesn't</v>

1601
01:11:20.161 --> 01:11:22.190
<v Speaker 3>collapse in the hierarchy of values.</v>

1602
01:11:23.490 --> 01:11:25.370
<v Speaker 3>Extract out what might be deposited,</v>

1603
01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:26.490
<v Speaker 3>meaning from your life,</v>

1604
01:11:26.491 --> 01:11:27.390
<v Speaker 3>which is bad enough.</v>

1605
01:11:27.630 --> 01:11:29.010
<v Speaker 3>It's sex you on the road,</v>

1606
01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:31.820
<v Speaker 3>it sets you on the road to hell.</v>

1607
01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:32.850
<v Speaker 3>That's the right way.</v>

1608
01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:34.190
<v Speaker 3>There isn't a prop.</v>

1609
01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:39.200
<v Speaker 3>There isn't a more accurate way of using metaphorical language to describe that</v>

1610
01:11:40.261 --> 01:11:45.261
<v Speaker 3>pathway then that and that's why it's part of what would you say the realization</v>

1611
01:11:47.341 --> 01:11:51.450
<v Speaker 3>that at the bottom of belief systems at the bottom of the way that people</v>

1612
01:11:51.451 --> 01:11:52.410
<v Speaker 3>construe the world,</v>

1613
01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:55.340
<v Speaker 3>there are religious metaphors at some,</v>

1614
01:11:55.410 --> 01:11:57.450
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you need a level of analysis,</v>

1615
01:11:57.451 --> 01:12:02.010
<v Speaker 3>but it's so deep that there isn't anything that suffices for the analysis except</v>

1616
01:12:02.011 --> 01:12:03.600
<v Speaker 3>that level of metaphorical language.</v>

1617
01:12:03.870 --> 01:12:05.970
<v Speaker 3>I certainly the case when you're dealing with people like,</v>

1618
01:12:06.450 --> 01:12:07.470
<v Speaker 3>like mass shooters,</v>

1619
01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:09.390
<v Speaker 3>especially the ones that commit suicide</v>

1620
01:12:11.870 --> 01:12:12.461
<v Speaker 3>because that's what,</v>

1621
01:12:12.461 --> 01:12:13.410
<v Speaker 3>these are the floors too,</v>

1622
01:12:13.411 --> 01:12:13.980
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1623
01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:14.813
<v Speaker 3>Cause my take,</v>

1624
01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:17.880
<v Speaker 3>why not just shoot yourself at home and save the rest of us all the God damn</v>

1625
01:12:17.881 --> 01:12:18.714
<v Speaker 3>trouble.</v>

1626
01:12:18.990 --> 01:12:19.290
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1627
01:12:19.290 --> 01:12:20.071
<v Speaker 3>No seriously.</v>

1628
01:12:20.071 --> 01:12:21.240
<v Speaker 3>That's an important question.</v>

1629
01:12:21.570 --> 01:12:22.650
<v Speaker 3>That's a crucial question.</v>

1630
01:12:23.070 --> 01:12:23.671
<v Speaker 3>So like if you're,</v>

1631
01:12:23.671 --> 01:12:24.121
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>

1632
01:12:24.121 --> 01:12:25.320
<v Speaker 3>if you're done with your life,</v>

1633
01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:28.110
<v Speaker 3>why bother with the big display?</v>

1634
01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:30.750
<v Speaker 3>Who exactly are you trying to convince?</v>

1635
01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:32.610
<v Speaker 3>And a what now?</v>

1636
01:12:32.611 --> 01:12:36.150
<v Speaker 3>Some of it is that desire for post-talk notoriety because there's a lot of</v>

1637
01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:37.200
<v Speaker 3>fantasizing can try.</v>

1638
01:12:37.201 --> 01:12:37.560
<v Speaker 3>It's that.</v>

1639
01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:38.130
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1640
01:12:38.130 --> 01:12:42.930
<v Speaker 3>well don't be sorry when this common theme in suicidal fantasies,</v>

1641
01:12:42.931 --> 01:12:46.770
<v Speaker 3>especially if on adolescents there'll be sorry they did acts to be witnessed,</v>

1642
01:12:46.771 --> 01:12:47.940
<v Speaker 3>happens when they see my,</v>

1643
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:48.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1644
01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:49.690
<v Speaker 3>cold body in the coffin or,</v>

1645
01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:52.620
<v Speaker 3>or when they see the mayhem that I produced.</v>

1646
01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:53.351
<v Speaker 3>But more it's,</v>

1647
01:12:53.351 --> 01:12:53.651
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1648
01:12:53.651 --> 01:12:54.120
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

1649
01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:58.080
<v Speaker 3>it's a quick group to notoriety status as we've already discovered this very</v>

1650
01:12:58.081 --> 01:12:58.911
<v Speaker 3>important to people.</v>

1651
01:12:58.911 --> 01:13:01.350
<v Speaker 3>And if you can't get into in a positive way,</v>

1652
01:13:02.010 --> 01:13:05.700
<v Speaker 3>then well you know what was given to me a negative way.</v>

1653
01:13:06.810 --> 01:13:07.760
<v Speaker 3>And so you know,</v>

1654
01:13:07.770 --> 01:13:11.010
<v Speaker 3>when we do ourselves a great disservice by publishing the names of the shooters</v>

1655
01:13:11.670 --> 01:13:16.080
<v Speaker 3>and maybe at some point we become mature enough not to do that.</v>

1656
01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:18.450
<v Speaker 3>But it doesn't look like that time is now.</v>

1657
01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:20.400
<v Speaker 3>And sort of these people are also very competitive.</v>

1658
01:13:20.990 --> 01:13:21.361
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1659
01:13:21.361 --> 01:13:23.790
<v Speaker 3>it's not like one shooter doesn't know what the previous one was.</v>

1660
01:13:23.791 --> 01:13:24.624
<v Speaker 3>Knockin</v>

1661
01:13:27.180 --> 01:13:32.180
<v Speaker 3>so in rural one I also talk about how to deal with this on equal landscapes.</v>

1662
01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:34.930
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1663
01:13:34.930 --> 01:13:39.840
<v Speaker 3>and I make a case about maybe you'd be bullied when you were a kid,</v>

1664
01:13:40.230 --> 01:13:41.360
<v Speaker 3>but some high you're liking,</v>

1665
01:13:41.370 --> 01:13:42.660
<v Speaker 3>cause everyone's pulling me as a kid,</v>

1666
01:13:42.661 --> 01:13:45.300
<v Speaker 3>but maybe boy more than normal.</v>

1667
01:13:45.330 --> 01:13:46.163
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1668
01:13:46.220 --> 01:13:51.220
<v Speaker 3>you are a continual part of the employee that's kind of traumatized students.</v>

1669
01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:55.740
<v Speaker 3>So you're not as upward with it as you might think.</v>

1670
01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:56.521
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1671
01:13:56.521 --> 01:13:57.990
<v Speaker 3>well what do you do about that?</v>

1672
01:13:58.780 --> 01:14:03.240
<v Speaker 3>Well hopefully you can remove yourself from the circumstances that obtained when</v>

1673
01:14:03.241 --> 01:14:04.074
<v Speaker 3>you were being bullied.</v>

1674
01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:07.080
<v Speaker 3>That happens often to people as they mature because you're much more likely to</v>

1675
01:14:07.081 --> 01:14:08.940
<v Speaker 3>be bullied as a kid that you are as an adult,</v>

1676
01:14:09.390 --> 01:14:09.630
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1677
01:14:09.630 --> 01:14:11.190
<v Speaker 3>So sometimes it just maturation.</v>

1678
01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:11.650
<v Speaker 3>We'll get that.</v>

1679
01:14:11.650 --> 01:14:15.520
<v Speaker 3>But you still might carry the scars of your,</v>

1680
01:14:15.670 --> 01:14:16.503
<v Speaker 3>of your</v>

1681
01:14:18.070 --> 01:14:23.070
<v Speaker 3>experiences with being unfair and Goldman or why you stretch yourself back up.</v>

1682
01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:27.520
<v Speaker 3>You do that physically and physically and then a physical element is something</v>

1683
01:14:27.521 --> 01:14:28.354
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1684
01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:36.660
<v Speaker 3>well first it's a recognition that see the kids who do these terrible things,</v>

1685
01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:43.160
<v Speaker 3>a very annoyed yet the way the world is structured because the world contains a</v>

1686
01:14:43.331 --> 01:14:48.331
<v Speaker 3>tremendous amount of suffering and they often regard themselves as hopefully you</v>

1687
01:14:49.121 --> 01:14:54.121
<v Speaker 3>call rebellious advocates of protest against the suffering of the world.</v>

1688
01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:56.370
<v Speaker 3>If you read the by your kids notes,</v>

1689
01:14:56.390 --> 01:14:58.810
<v Speaker 3>you'll see that jump the judges of being,</v>

1690
01:14:58.811 --> 01:15:01.470
<v Speaker 3>I think that because being is contaminated with suffering,</v>

1691
01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:03.500
<v Speaker 3>if 11 months that it should be eradicated,</v>

1692
01:15:03.550 --> 01:15:04.750
<v Speaker 3>that's the central theory.</v>

1693
01:15:05.310 --> 01:15:06.143
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1694
01:15:06.310 --> 01:15:07.143
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1695
01:15:08.850 --> 01:15:12.040
<v Speaker 3>we allow their own suffering to embetter them.</v>

1696
01:15:12.670 --> 01:15:14.290
<v Speaker 3>I guess that's the right way thinking about it.</v>

1697
01:15:14.290 --> 01:15:15.310
<v Speaker 3>And it's understandable,</v>

1698
01:15:15.340 --> 01:15:15.610
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1699
01:15:15.610 --> 01:15:20.080
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing is that because life is hard and some people really have heart</v>

1700
01:15:20.081 --> 01:15:20.381
<v Speaker 3>bucks,</v>

1701
01:15:20.381 --> 01:15:20.651
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1702
01:15:20.651 --> 01:15:22.900
<v Speaker 3>like almost everyone has a pretty hard life.</v>

1703
01:15:23.170 --> 01:15:24.003
<v Speaker 3>You get right down.</v>

1704
01:15:24.100 --> 01:15:24.933
<v Speaker 3>I'm ready to talk.</v>

1705
01:15:26.140 --> 01:15:27.120
<v Speaker 3>People have hard lives.</v>

1706
01:15:27.140 --> 01:15:29.200
<v Speaker 3>You know you have $100 million,</v>

1707
01:15:29.201 --> 01:15:30.090
<v Speaker 3>but your father's dying.</v>

1708
01:15:30.810 --> 01:15:33.190
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's great that you're rich,</v>

1709
01:15:33.191 --> 01:15:35.520
<v Speaker 3>but you know your father's going to hell.</v>

1710
01:15:35.521 --> 01:15:36.040
<v Speaker 3>It's fine.</v>

1711
01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:40.930
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing to do with almost everyone has gotten an ongoing tragedy in</v>

1712
01:15:40.931 --> 01:15:45.160
<v Speaker 3>their own personal life as an individual or is typing associated with someone</v>

1713
01:15:45.161 --> 01:15:48.880
<v Speaker 3>who does and there's not much we can do in some ways to protect ourselves</v>

1714
01:15:48.881 --> 01:15:50.590
<v Speaker 3>against that material.</v>

1715
01:15:50.591 --> 01:15:51.201
<v Speaker 3>Wealth alone,</v>

1716
01:15:51.201 --> 01:15:53.440
<v Speaker 3>just like it's better than poverty,</v>

1717
01:15:53.470 --> 01:15:55.180
<v Speaker 3>but there's many things.</v>

1718
01:15:55.181 --> 01:15:58.210
<v Speaker 3>It just doesn't address many of the most fundamental things.</v>

1719
01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:00.100
<v Speaker 3>There's every reason to become admitted,</v>

1720
01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:02.970
<v Speaker 3>but the problem is is if you becoming better to them,</v>

1721
01:16:03.310 --> 01:16:07.780
<v Speaker 3>everything that makes you bitter gets worth that seems to be able to bad</v>

1722
01:16:07.781 --> 01:16:08.590
<v Speaker 3>solution.</v>

1723
01:16:08.590 --> 01:16:09.630
<v Speaker 3>I spent a lot of times,</v>

1724
01:16:09.631 --> 01:16:13.360
<v Speaker 3>some of you might have listened to my biblical lectures on cane enabled because</v>

1725
01:16:13.361 --> 01:16:14.650
<v Speaker 3>that's the story of Cain and Abel.</v>

1726
01:16:14.860 --> 01:16:19.130
<v Speaker 3>Cain gets bitter and he's angry at God because of the structure of the universe.</v>

1727
01:16:19.570 --> 01:16:20.200
<v Speaker 3>No mongers,</v>

1728
01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:21.033
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1729
01:16:21.230 --> 01:16:24.870
<v Speaker 3>less time up as having none of us basically tells Kane.</v>

1730
01:16:24.871 --> 01:16:29.871
<v Speaker 3>Then if he used everything that was in front of him to its proper advantage,</v>

1731
01:16:31.090 --> 01:16:33.880
<v Speaker 3>then the world that he wouldn't have,</v>

1732
01:16:33.881 --> 01:16:37.480
<v Speaker 3>it would no longer be characterized by an unbearable suffering.</v>

1733
01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:39.100
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1734
01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:42.850
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that I've learned from reading the biblical stories among</v>

1735
01:16:42.851 --> 01:16:43.710
<v Speaker 3>other things and,</v>

1736
01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:44.920
<v Speaker 3>and the clinical literature,</v>

1737
01:16:44.921 --> 01:16:45.754
<v Speaker 3>I would say,</v>

1738
01:16:45.820 --> 01:16:48.010
<v Speaker 3>is that there's really something to that idea.</v>

1739
01:16:48.730 --> 01:16:49.080
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1740
01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:51.550
<v Speaker 3>and I said the 12 rules for life is a very dark book.</v>

1741
01:16:52.010 --> 01:16:52.270
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1742
01:16:52.270 --> 01:16:55.510
<v Speaker 3>because plays up in no uncertain terms.</v>

1743
01:16:55.511 --> 01:16:56.181
<v Speaker 3>The idea of a,</v>

1744
01:16:56.181 --> 01:16:57.800
<v Speaker 3>that life is characterized by suffering,</v>

1745
01:16:57.830 --> 01:16:58.870
<v Speaker 3>that's a universal truth,</v>

1746
01:16:58.990 --> 01:16:59.530
<v Speaker 3>suffering,</v>

1747
01:16:59.530 --> 01:17:00.550
<v Speaker 3>pain and anxiety.</v>

1748
01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:04.500
<v Speaker 3>To put it more in a more differentiated manner.</v>

1749
01:17:04.930 --> 01:17:05.890
<v Speaker 3>And at that painting,</v>

1750
01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:07.620
<v Speaker 3>suffering is enough to embitter you.</v>

1751
01:17:08.170 --> 01:17:09.860
<v Speaker 3>And understandably so.</v>

1752
01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:12.710
<v Speaker 3>So that's the dark status quo,</v>

1753
01:17:12.711 --> 01:17:13.520
<v Speaker 3>let's say.</v>

1754
01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:14.990
<v Speaker 3>But then the next question would be,</v>

1755
01:17:14.991 --> 01:17:17.090
<v Speaker 3>what do you have any arm movements against that?</v>

1756
01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:17.390
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1757
01:17:17.390 --> 01:17:21.890
<v Speaker 3>What do you use in your struggle against tragedy and evil?</v>

1758
01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:23.393
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

1759
01:17:24.590 --> 01:17:28.040
<v Speaker 3>while that's courage and truth and courage,</v>

1760
01:17:28.050 --> 01:17:29.250
<v Speaker 3>that's partly posture.</v>

1761
01:17:30.130 --> 01:17:30.440
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1762
01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:34.760
<v Speaker 3>cause when you stand up and expose yourself and you've exposed the parts of you</v>

1763
01:17:34.761 --> 01:17:36.800
<v Speaker 3>that you're most vulnerable to confidence stamps,</v>

1764
01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:39.140
<v Speaker 3>it's like how bad or you know,</v>

1765
01:17:39.980 --> 01:17:40.813
<v Speaker 3>come acne.</v>

1766
01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.500
<v Speaker 3>And that's the attitude to the world.</v>

1767
01:17:42.501 --> 01:17:43.041
<v Speaker 3>It's combat,</v>

1768
01:17:43.041 --> 01:17:43.461
<v Speaker 3>it's downs,</v>

1769
01:17:43.461 --> 01:17:44.241
<v Speaker 3>but not just that.</v>

1770
01:17:44.241 --> 01:17:46.400
<v Speaker 3>It's also a trusting stance in some sense,</v>

1771
01:17:46.420 --> 01:17:46.890
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1772
01:17:46.890 --> 01:17:49.900
<v Speaker 3>Cause the Hydra people means that you don't trust them on,</v>

1773
01:17:50.020 --> 01:17:50.853
<v Speaker 3>I've learned something,</v>

1774
01:17:51.140 --> 01:17:55.970
<v Speaker 3>something too about the difference between nine eva take now you've trust and</v>

1775
01:17:55.971 --> 01:17:56.804
<v Speaker 3>trust.</v>

1776
01:17:57.080 --> 01:18:01.710
<v Speaker 3>So like a child who's naive thinks everyone is good and then maybe we'll become,</v>

1777
01:18:01.730 --> 01:18:02.650
<v Speaker 3>be traded her guest.</v>

1778
01:18:02.651 --> 01:18:05.720
<v Speaker 3>The consequences of naive and everyone was good and so trust,</v>

1779
01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:06.860
<v Speaker 3>but that's not trust.</v>

1780
01:18:06.861 --> 01:18:07.780
<v Speaker 3>That's just naive.</v>

1781
01:18:08.270 --> 01:18:09.200
<v Speaker 3>And it's not a virtue.</v>

1782
01:18:09.740 --> 01:18:11.750
<v Speaker 3>Even though it trusting child was a lovely thing.</v>

1783
01:18:11.930 --> 01:18:12.763
<v Speaker 3>It's not a virtue.</v>

1784
01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:17.000
<v Speaker 3>It's just the absence of experience with betrayal.</v>

1785
01:18:17.170 --> 01:18:17.781
<v Speaker 3>So we'll like,</v>

1786
01:18:17.781 --> 01:18:19.370
<v Speaker 3>once you're an adult teenager,</v>

1787
01:18:19.371 --> 01:18:20.660
<v Speaker 3>like say you've been hurt,</v>

1788
01:18:20.661 --> 01:18:21.560
<v Speaker 3>you've been betrayed,</v>

1789
01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:25.520
<v Speaker 3>why should you trust and answer is never because people are trustworthy.</v>

1790
01:18:25.970 --> 01:18:26.930
<v Speaker 3>That's the wrong answer.</v>

1791
01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:29.480
<v Speaker 3>The right answer is because you're a courageous.</v>

1792
01:18:30.170 --> 01:18:31.160
<v Speaker 3>That's the right answer.</v>

1793
01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:33.950
<v Speaker 3>And so you meet people with an attitude of trust,</v>

1794
01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:37.310
<v Speaker 3>knowing what can go wrong,</v>

1795
01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:42.880
<v Speaker 3>but the willing to take that as a necessary cost of potentially bringing out the</v>

1796
01:18:42.891 --> 01:18:44.810
<v Speaker 3>best in the other person and in you.</v>

1797
01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:46.700
<v Speaker 3>And I would say,</v>

1798
01:18:47.210 --> 01:18:50.690
<v Speaker 3>I would also say that the empirical data on the utility of that as an approach</v>

1799
01:18:50.691 --> 01:18:52.190
<v Speaker 3>is also quite staggering with the high,</v>

1800
01:18:52.490 --> 01:18:56.990
<v Speaker 3>some of the best analysis of what makes countries rich versus poor,</v>

1801
01:18:57.230 --> 01:19:01.700
<v Speaker 3>but indicated that the level of interpersonal trust and the country is a great</v>

1802
01:19:01.701 --> 01:19:05.870
<v Speaker 3>predictor of economic don't believe economic success but probability of economic</v>

1803
01:19:05.871 --> 01:19:06.704
<v Speaker 3>growth.</v>

1804
01:19:06.890 --> 01:19:09.470
<v Speaker 3>And you can understand why that is is like how the hell are you going to train</v>

1805
01:19:09.471 --> 01:19:14.471
<v Speaker 3>with someone without accruing enforced and costs that will completely obliterate</v>

1806
01:19:15.081 --> 01:19:17.510
<v Speaker 3>the utility of the train unless you trust them.</v>

1807
01:19:17.511 --> 01:19:18.650
<v Speaker 3>Like if I can trust you,</v>

1808
01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:20.000
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to know anything about you.</v>

1809
01:19:20.140 --> 01:19:22.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to know how full snakes you actually are.</v>

1810
01:19:22.970 --> 01:19:27.020
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter cause you simplify yourself down with your word and then we</v>

1811
01:19:27.021 --> 01:19:29.000
<v Speaker 3>can interact cooperative.</v>

1812
01:19:29.060 --> 01:19:33.350
<v Speaker 3>And so I really think that the only natural resource,</v>

1813
01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:34.910
<v Speaker 3>apart from intelligence,</v>

1814
01:19:34.911 --> 01:19:39.250
<v Speaker 3>perhaps his trucks and the trust is actually a consequence of courage and not of</v>

1815
01:19:39.260 --> 01:19:40.610
<v Speaker 3>naivety when it's matured.</v>

1816
01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.850
<v Speaker 3>And I help my clients with that idea a lot.</v>

1817
01:19:43.970 --> 01:19:45.130
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's not exactly,</v>

1818
01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:50.280
<v Speaker 3>I read the works of most of the brake conditions of the 20th century.</v>

1819
01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:52.040
<v Speaker 3>So I've learned a tremendous amount from,</v>

1820
01:19:52.430 --> 01:19:52.671
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1821
01:19:52.671 --> 01:19:53.870
<v Speaker 3>from reading what they have to say.</v>

1822
01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:56.600
<v Speaker 3>And that idea of courageous trust is a really,</v>

1823
01:19:56.690 --> 01:19:58.100
<v Speaker 3>that's an unbelievably powerful,</v>

1824
01:19:58.940 --> 01:19:59.850
<v Speaker 3>especially when you're doing,</v>

1825
01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:00.750
<v Speaker 3>he might think behind,</v>

1826
01:20:00.750 --> 01:20:01.220
<v Speaker 3>not neat,</v>

1827
01:20:01.220 --> 01:20:01.551
<v Speaker 3>naive,</v>

1828
01:20:01.551 --> 01:20:02.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to trust people.</v>

1829
01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:03.351
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1830
01:20:03.351 --> 01:20:03.681
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1831
01:20:03.681 --> 01:20:04.221
<v Speaker 3>fair enough.</v>

1832
01:20:04.221 --> 01:20:05.330
<v Speaker 3>That makes you not naive.</v>

1833
01:20:05.390 --> 01:20:06.223
<v Speaker 3>That's step one.</v>

1834
01:20:06.420 --> 01:20:07.500
<v Speaker 3>Now you step one,</v>

1835
01:20:07.620 --> 01:20:08.610
<v Speaker 3>not naive,</v>

1836
01:20:09.030 --> 01:20:10.660
<v Speaker 3>that step to not,</v>

1837
01:20:10.930 --> 01:20:12.450
<v Speaker 3>not even willing to trust,</v>

1838
01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:13.830
<v Speaker 3>that's day three.</v>

1839
01:20:14.330 --> 01:20:15.060
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1840
01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:15.990
<v Speaker 3>And that opens the world.</v>

1841
01:20:15.991 --> 01:20:17.250
<v Speaker 3>That's to Q again say,</v>

1842
01:20:17.260 --> 01:20:20.940
<v Speaker 3>will you voluntarily take on the fact that you're vulnerable and that life is</v>

1843
01:20:20.941 --> 01:20:22.890
<v Speaker 3>tragic and that it's tainted by malevolence.</v>

1844
01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:27.900
<v Speaker 3>You accept that and then you decided to move forward and do good despite that.</v>

1845
01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:30.330
<v Speaker 3>And well I don't.</v>

1846
01:20:30.530 --> 01:20:30.821
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1847
01:20:30.821 --> 01:20:33.480
<v Speaker 3>and so part of the conclusion in 12 rules for life,</v>

1848
01:20:33.481 --> 01:20:36.120
<v Speaker 3>although not stated no as a formal conclusion,</v>

1849
01:20:36.121 --> 01:20:41.121
<v Speaker 3>is that terrible as tragedy is and tainted by malevolence as life is truth and</v>

1850
01:20:44.631 --> 01:20:47.370
<v Speaker 3>courage are stronger than pain and despair.</v>

1851
01:20:47.740 --> 01:20:48.990
<v Speaker 3>And I actually think that's true.</v>

1852
01:20:49.530 --> 01:20:50.131
<v Speaker 3>I think it's true.</v>

1853
01:20:50.131 --> 01:20:51.750
<v Speaker 3>Literally you see,</v>

1854
01:20:51.751 --> 01:20:53.450
<v Speaker 3>you see this in psychotherapy.</v>

1855
01:20:54.030 --> 01:20:58.500
<v Speaker 3>So if someone comes to you and they have like paralyzing levels of anxiety,</v>

1856
01:20:58.720 --> 01:20:59.570
<v Speaker 3>you cannot give you the house.</v>

1857
01:20:59.620 --> 01:21:00.453
<v Speaker 3>They're agoraphobic.</v>

1858
01:21:00.930 --> 01:21:04.050
<v Speaker 3>So they're terrified of being in an elevator and getting stuck.</v>

1859
01:21:04.051 --> 01:21:04.590
<v Speaker 3>They're afraid.</v>

1860
01:21:04.590 --> 01:21:06.640
<v Speaker 3>What the really afraid of and an elevator is,</v>

1861
01:21:06.641 --> 01:21:07.650
<v Speaker 3>they'll often,</v>

1862
01:21:07.651 --> 01:21:11.790
<v Speaker 3>people who have anger phobia are afraid that they'll have a heart attack</v>

1863
01:21:11.791 --> 01:21:12.181
<v Speaker 3>somewhere.</v>

1864
01:21:12.181 --> 01:21:13.350
<v Speaker 3>They can't get to the hospital.</v>

1865
01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:16.080
<v Speaker 3>So then they get afraid of anywhere that they might go away,</v>

1866
01:21:16.090 --> 01:21:17.490
<v Speaker 3>they couldn't get to the hospital quickly.</v>

1867
01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:19.800
<v Speaker 3>And so that will be taxis,</v>

1868
01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:21.510
<v Speaker 3>especially in a busy street.</v>

1869
01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:22.770
<v Speaker 3>Subways,</v>

1870
01:21:22.860 --> 01:21:27.510
<v Speaker 3>theaters telemeers getting in places where they might get trapped and their</v>

1871
01:21:27.511 --> 01:21:31.830
<v Speaker 3>thoughts are if often having heart palpitations or someone close to them died of</v>

1872
01:21:31.831 --> 01:21:35.670
<v Speaker 3>a heart attack or they have to have any history of heart disease or they've</v>

1873
01:21:35.671 --> 01:21:38.640
<v Speaker 3>recently been through a divorce and being very anxious because of that and are</v>

1874
01:21:38.641 --> 01:21:40.920
<v Speaker 3>more cognizant that the hotel anyway,</v>

1875
01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:44.850
<v Speaker 3>they have got reasons to start becoming anxious and then being avoid places that</v>

1876
01:21:44.851 --> 01:21:47.460
<v Speaker 3>they might get trapped in that they get more and more anxious and fighting.</v>

1877
01:21:47.460 --> 01:21:48.630
<v Speaker 3>They can't even leave their house.</v>

1878
01:21:48.990 --> 01:21:52.020
<v Speaker 3>And so when you treat someone like that,</v>

1879
01:21:52.190 --> 01:21:56.160
<v Speaker 3>you don't make them less afraid because it's too damn late for that,</v>

1880
01:21:56.730 --> 01:21:57.563
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1881
01:21:58.260 --> 01:21:59.460
<v Speaker 3>they're naive to begin with.</v>

1882
01:21:59.461 --> 01:22:00.540
<v Speaker 3>This is often the case with,</v>

1883
01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:02.280
<v Speaker 3>it's usually women who felt anger phobia.</v>

1884
01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:07.050
<v Speaker 3>They've often be over protected by the fondant or the boyfriend or the husband</v>

1885
01:22:07.051 --> 01:22:08.310
<v Speaker 3>or whatever have you,</v>

1886
01:22:08.311 --> 01:22:12.450
<v Speaker 3>and then something comes along that they can't be protected from like some hint</v>

1887
01:22:12.451 --> 01:22:17.400
<v Speaker 3>of mortality or the possibility of divorce and they become extraordinarily</v>

1888
01:22:17.401 --> 01:22:18.920
<v Speaker 3>anxious to come see a therapist.</v>

1889
01:22:19.260 --> 01:22:20.370
<v Speaker 3>Therapist has any sense.</v>

1890
01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:21.233
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't say,</v>

1891
01:22:21.330 --> 01:22:21.671
<v Speaker 3>why don't we,</v>

1892
01:22:21.671 --> 01:22:22.740
<v Speaker 3>what you're anxious about?</v>

1893
01:22:23.150 --> 01:22:23.491
<v Speaker 3>It says,</v>

1894
01:22:23.491 --> 01:22:23.701
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1895
01:22:23.701 --> 01:22:24.710
<v Speaker 3>of course you're anxious,</v>

1896
01:22:24.780 --> 01:22:27.710
<v Speaker 3>so I could s what are you staggering that everyone is terrified?</v>

1897
01:22:28.060 --> 01:22:29.850
<v Speaker 3>One scholar was open the time,</v>

1898
01:22:30.500 --> 01:22:32.270
<v Speaker 3>like why are people anxious?</v>

1899
01:22:32.610 --> 01:22:37.000
<v Speaker 3>What a stupid question that like really wanting phalanges.</v>

1900
01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:38.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1901
01:22:38.110 --> 01:22:39.420
<v Speaker 3>One of the people drink.</v>

1902
01:22:39.570 --> 01:22:40.920
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I can answer for that.</v>

1903
01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:41.890
<v Speaker 3>Why don't people take,</v>

1904
01:22:41.890 --> 01:22:42.630
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1905
01:22:42.630 --> 01:22:43.650
<v Speaker 3>no wrong question,</v>

1906
01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:44.131
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1907
01:22:44.131 --> 01:22:47.770
<v Speaker 3>Question is why don't they take it all the time to the exclusion of all else?</v>

1908
01:22:50.970 --> 01:22:52.350
<v Speaker 3>It's like we know why people take,</v>

1909
01:22:52.370 --> 01:22:52.770
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1910
01:22:52.770 --> 01:22:53.840
<v Speaker 3>It's perfectly all of this.</v>

1911
01:22:53.841 --> 01:22:56.190
<v Speaker 3>And so the question with anxieties,</v>

1912
01:22:56.430 --> 01:23:00.510
<v Speaker 3>how is it that some people aren't anxious some of the time and with the</v>

1913
01:23:00.511 --> 01:23:01.220
<v Speaker 3>agoraphobic,</v>

1914
01:23:01.220 --> 01:23:01.771
<v Speaker 3>the issue is,</v>

1915
01:23:01.771 --> 01:23:01.861
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1916
01:23:01.861 --> 01:23:06.220
<v Speaker 3>how do you bring in state that now that they've come to confrontation with their</v>

1917
01:23:06.221 --> 01:23:07.780
<v Speaker 3>own vulnerability is mortality.</v>

1918
01:23:07.810 --> 01:23:08.860
<v Speaker 3>That's basically the issue.</v>

1919
01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:10.180
<v Speaker 3>There's no holding back.</v>

1920
01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:11.380
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1921
01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:12.400
<v Speaker 3>maybe the person who says,</v>

1922
01:23:12.401 --> 01:23:12.521
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1923
01:23:12.521 --> 01:23:13.690
<v Speaker 3>I've got her qualifications.</v>

1924
01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:15.250
<v Speaker 3>I have a family history of heart disease.</v>

1925
01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:17.100
<v Speaker 3>It's like I'm sure a terrified.</v>

1926
01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:17.680
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1927
01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:18.460
<v Speaker 3>how does nothing,</v>

1928
01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:20.050
<v Speaker 3>you probably won't have a heart attack.</v>

1929
01:23:20.980 --> 01:23:21.813
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1930
01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:22.601
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1931
01:23:22.601 --> 01:23:23.230
<v Speaker 3>thanks.</v>

1932
01:23:23.230 --> 01:23:25.010
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>

1933
01:23:27.130 --> 01:23:28.810
<v Speaker 3>Once that specter of here,</v>

1934
01:23:28.811 --> 01:23:29.920
<v Speaker 3>this in front of you,</v>

1935
01:23:30.670 --> 01:23:32.920
<v Speaker 3>probability is irrelevant.</v>

1936
01:23:34.060 --> 01:23:36.720
<v Speaker 3>Most of what did you do is you teach people to live in spite of them.</v>

1937
01:23:37.630 --> 01:23:39.340
<v Speaker 3>You teach them to be courageous,</v>

1938
01:23:39.341 --> 01:23:40.174
<v Speaker 3>not to be,</v>

1939
01:23:40.660 --> 01:23:41.493
<v Speaker 3>not afraid.</v>

1940
01:23:42.010 --> 01:23:43.180
<v Speaker 3>You teach them to be brave.</v>

1941
01:23:43.181 --> 01:23:46.390
<v Speaker 3>And the way you do that is you show them that there's more to them than they</v>

1942
01:23:46.391 --> 01:23:47.224
<v Speaker 3>thought.</v>

1943
01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:49.690
<v Speaker 3>So you know when you do this with behavioral exposure,</v>

1944
01:23:49.691 --> 01:23:50.201
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1945
01:23:50.201 --> 01:23:54.250
<v Speaker 3>so let's say you want to take an agoraphobic doesn't mean an elevator for three</v>

1946
01:23:54.251 --> 01:23:55.084
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

1947
01:23:55.090 --> 01:23:56.140
<v Speaker 3>And so you know,</v>

1948
01:23:56.170 --> 01:23:57.910
<v Speaker 3>maybe they work on the 15th floor.</v>

1949
01:23:57.911 --> 01:23:58.631
<v Speaker 3>This is actually an,</v>

1950
01:23:58.631 --> 01:23:59.321
<v Speaker 3>they're getting older.</v>

1951
01:23:59.321 --> 01:24:00.430
<v Speaker 3>It's actually a problem,</v>

1952
01:24:00.431 --> 01:24:00.630
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1953
01:24:00.630 --> 01:24:05.050
<v Speaker 3>You got to take the down elevator and there's a whole complex of fears</v>

1954
01:24:05.051 --> 01:24:06.310
<v Speaker 3>associated with the elevator.</v>

1955
01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:07.630
<v Speaker 3>So you say,</v>

1956
01:24:07.631 --> 01:24:08.464
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1957
01:24:08.790 --> 01:24:09.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1958
01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:09.770
<v Speaker 3>what are you afraid of?</v>

1959
01:24:09.770 --> 01:24:10.180
<v Speaker 3>And they say,</v>

1960
01:24:10.180 --> 01:24:10.551
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1961
01:24:10.551 --> 01:24:11.384
<v Speaker 3>I'll have a heart attack.</v>

1962
01:24:11.430 --> 01:24:13.110
<v Speaker 3>That elevator stop all get stuck,</v>

1963
01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:17.110
<v Speaker 3>all panic on a heart attack and die and there'll be 300 people in the elevator</v>

1964
01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:19.210
<v Speaker 3>and they'll make a fool of myself while I'm dying.</v>

1965
01:24:19.211 --> 01:24:21.020
<v Speaker 3>And no point in being black</v>

1966
01:24:24.230 --> 01:24:26.680
<v Speaker 3>because it's social humiliation.</v>

1967
01:24:26.820 --> 01:24:28.330
<v Speaker 3>If people hate plus death.</v>

1968
01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:30.010
<v Speaker 3>And so you get those two together,</v>

1969
01:24:30.011 --> 01:24:32.800
<v Speaker 3>you ever read walloping fear of complex going,</v>

1970
01:24:32.801 --> 01:24:35.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to die slowly and stupidly.</v>

1971
01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:36.041
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1972
01:24:36.041 --> 01:24:38.160
<v Speaker 3>lots of people are gathered around watching it.</v>

1973
01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:41.333
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1974
01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:42.370
<v Speaker 3>so I,</v>

1975
01:24:42.370 --> 01:24:44.170
<v Speaker 3>I had for agoraphobic client.</v>

1976
01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:47.500
<v Speaker 3>So the way you treat someone like that and you say,</v>

1977
01:24:47.501 --> 01:24:47.681
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1978
01:24:47.681 --> 01:24:48.011
<v Speaker 3>well let's,</v>

1979
01:24:48.011 --> 01:24:48.844
<v Speaker 3>let's pick some,</v>

1980
01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:52.550
<v Speaker 3>write down the 10 things you're really afraid of with number one being the thing</v>

1981
01:24:52.551 --> 01:24:53.291
<v Speaker 3>you're most afraid of,</v>

1982
01:24:53.291 --> 01:24:54.160
<v Speaker 3>a number 10 minutes,</v>

1983
01:24:54.161 --> 01:24:55.300
<v Speaker 3>something you're pretty afraid of.</v>

1984
01:24:55.301 --> 01:24:57.330
<v Speaker 3>And so let's say they list elevators.</v>

1985
01:24:57.340 --> 01:24:58.650
<v Speaker 3>His numbers would say,</v>

1986
01:24:58.700 --> 01:24:58.901
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1987
01:24:58.901 --> 01:25:02.890
<v Speaker 3>we're going to start with number 10 because we're not going to make this any</v>

1988
01:25:02.891 --> 01:25:03.790
<v Speaker 3>more difficult for you.</v>

1989
01:25:03.791 --> 01:25:04.950
<v Speaker 3>Then that's,</v>

1990
01:25:05.530 --> 01:25:05.951
<v Speaker 3>then you say,</v>

1991
01:25:05.951 --> 01:25:06.191
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1992
01:25:06.191 --> 01:25:06.610
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

1993
01:25:06.610 --> 01:25:08.080
<v Speaker 3>there's no tricks to this.</v>

1994
01:25:08.350 --> 01:25:09.760
<v Speaker 3>You've done it in the first guys to trust you.</v>

1995
01:25:10.030 --> 01:25:14.180
<v Speaker 3>I treated some of them with a needle phobia while bathroom and this person has</v>

1996
01:25:14.470 --> 01:25:17.680
<v Speaker 3>needle phobia that was so intense that he would have dental surgery without</v>

1997
01:25:17.770 --> 01:25:18.603
<v Speaker 3>anesthesia.</v>

1998
01:25:18.820 --> 01:25:19.653
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1999
01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:20.111
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

2000
01:25:20.111 --> 01:25:20.471
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2001
01:25:20.471 --> 01:25:24.940
<v Speaker 3>So we know that's the definition of whether not,</v>

2002
01:25:27.620 --> 01:25:28.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2003
01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:33.200
<v Speaker 3>I brought a needle into the office and I told him a week before I'm going to</v>

2004
01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:36.220
<v Speaker 3>bring an evening into the office and it's going to be sitting on the shelf right</v>

2005
01:25:36.221 --> 01:25:40.340
<v Speaker 3>there and when you come in next week I'll show it to you and you'll know where</v>

2006
01:25:40.341 --> 01:25:42.730
<v Speaker 3>it gets cause you don't muck about with your clients.</v>

2007
01:25:42.730 --> 01:25:44.290
<v Speaker 3>They have to know exactly what's going on.</v>

2008
01:25:44.590 --> 01:25:46.840
<v Speaker 3>And then when I did the cameras practice,</v>

2009
01:25:47.110 --> 01:25:48.550
<v Speaker 3>I let him practice leaving.</v>

2010
01:25:49.390 --> 01:25:50.620
<v Speaker 3>I said because I want you to,</v>

2011
01:25:50.621 --> 01:25:51.790
<v Speaker 3>if you're a neutral with this,</v>

2012
01:25:51.820 --> 01:25:53.470
<v Speaker 3>that was the rule and you're in control this,</v>

2013
01:25:53.860 --> 01:25:57.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to pick up that Amigo but not until I tell you and if you want me to</v>

2014
01:25:57.041 --> 01:26:00.970
<v Speaker 3>stop at any time I will stop and if you want to leave at anytime you can just</v>

2015
01:26:00.971 --> 01:26:01.241
<v Speaker 3>leave it.</v>

2016
01:26:01.241 --> 01:26:02.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get your fear if you leave it.</v>

2017
01:26:02.990 --> 01:26:06.200
<v Speaker 3>And so I haven't practiced like 10 times how,</v>

2018
01:26:06.201 --> 01:26:09.200
<v Speaker 3>let me just stop and leave it because just telling me,</v>

2019
01:26:09.230 --> 01:26:10.520
<v Speaker 3>telling him that it wasn't enough.</v>

2020
01:26:10.860 --> 01:26:14.990
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of like practicing something with pretending to play with the child,</v>

2021
01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:15.853
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2022
01:26:15.860 --> 01:26:16.940
<v Speaker 3>To act it out with them.</v>

2023
01:26:16.941 --> 01:26:18.200
<v Speaker 3>It's better than just to tell them,</v>

2024
01:26:18.380 --> 01:26:20.180
<v Speaker 3>because you get to know if you have children by the way.</v>

2025
01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:22.110
<v Speaker 3>So I let them practice that,</v>

2026
01:26:22.111 --> 01:26:23.010
<v Speaker 3>like tender,</v>

2027
01:26:23.060 --> 01:26:24.200
<v Speaker 3>tell him he was bored with it,</v>

2028
01:26:24.330 --> 01:26:26.280
<v Speaker 3>no new drill was right.</v>

2029
01:26:26.780 --> 01:26:27.613
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

2030
01:26:27.650 --> 01:26:27.891
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2031
01:26:27.891 --> 01:26:28.221
<v Speaker 3>I'd say,</v>

2032
01:26:28.221 --> 01:26:28.341
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2033
01:26:28.341 --> 01:26:30.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to pick up this needle now I'm going to four inches.</v>

2034
01:26:31.370 --> 01:26:32.700
<v Speaker 3>And Norman one kind.</v>

2035
01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:33.853
<v Speaker 3>You go look at it,</v>

2036
01:26:34.290 --> 01:26:35.123
<v Speaker 3>you have to look at it.</v>

2037
01:26:35.180 --> 01:26:36.890
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing that you got to look terrible,</v>

2038
01:26:37.210 --> 01:26:38.043
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2039
01:26:38.140 --> 01:26:41.870
<v Speaker 3>And then you dissociated from all the terrible things you imagine if my feet,</v>

2040
01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:44.270
<v Speaker 3>and so it took about six sessions,</v>

2041
01:26:44.271 --> 01:26:47.150
<v Speaker 3>something like that before he could go to the hospital and had a needle,</v>

2042
01:26:47.540 --> 01:26:48.300
<v Speaker 3>you feel,</v>

2043
01:26:48.300 --> 01:26:49.370
<v Speaker 3>but okay.</v>

2044
01:26:49.690 --> 01:26:50.810
<v Speaker 3>But what happened,</v>

2045
01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:51.141
<v Speaker 3>you see,</v>

2046
01:26:51.141 --> 01:26:54.060
<v Speaker 3>wasn't that he got less afraid of needles is that he got braver about,</v>

2047
01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:55.113
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2048
01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:56.990
<v Speaker 3>So now,</v>

2049
01:26:57.020 --> 01:26:58.050
<v Speaker 3>so the first one,</v>

2050
01:26:58.051 --> 01:26:59.290
<v Speaker 3>we have to be elevated problems.</v>

2051
01:26:59.300 --> 01:27:00.210
<v Speaker 3>So this is what happens.</v>

2052
01:27:01.090 --> 01:27:01.551
<v Speaker 3>So you say,</v>

2053
01:27:01.551 --> 01:27:02.384
<v Speaker 3>well look,</v>

2054
01:27:02.750 --> 01:27:05.840
<v Speaker 3>how about looking at some pictures of elevators and they say,</v>

2055
01:27:05.841 --> 01:27:06.051
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2056
01:27:06.051 --> 01:27:07.100
<v Speaker 3>I think I can handle that.</v>

2057
01:27:07.250 --> 01:27:08.210
<v Speaker 3>Or maybe they don't.</v>

2058
01:27:08.510 --> 01:27:09.530
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's enough to say,</v>

2059
01:27:09.531 --> 01:27:09.741
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2060
01:27:09.741 --> 01:27:11.420
<v Speaker 3>well let's look at a hundred pictures of elevators.</v>

2061
01:27:11.870 --> 01:27:14.170
<v Speaker 3>You'll get bored of it sooner or later and so,</v>

2062
01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:17.120
<v Speaker 3>and you want to get bored of it because if you're bored or something,</v>

2063
01:27:17.121 --> 01:27:18.050
<v Speaker 3>you're not anxious about it.</v>

2064
01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:18.590
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>

2065
01:27:18.590 --> 01:27:19.423
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2066
01:27:19.610 --> 01:27:20.780
<v Speaker 3>here's a picture of an elevator.</v>

2067
01:27:21.170 --> 01:27:22.200
<v Speaker 3>How are you feeling when all,</v>

2068
01:27:22.210 --> 01:27:22.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2069
01:27:22.580 --> 01:27:25.130
<v Speaker 3>I can feel my heart rate accelerating and I'm breathing more heavily.</v>

2070
01:27:25.131 --> 01:27:25.401
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2071
01:27:25.401 --> 01:27:25.611
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2072
01:27:25.611 --> 01:27:29.390
<v Speaker 3>we'll just keep looking at it until that stops it stop.</v>

2073
01:27:29.570 --> 01:27:30.830
<v Speaker 3>If the person doesn't run away,</v>

2074
01:27:31.100 --> 01:27:36.060
<v Speaker 3>that was talk in five minutes or so because anxiety system sees the logic,</v>

2075
01:27:36.170 --> 01:27:41.170
<v Speaker 3>it makes all and it scans to see if anything additionally terrible happens and</v>

2076
01:27:42.441 --> 01:27:43.640
<v Speaker 3>if answer is no,</v>

2077
01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:44.750
<v Speaker 3>then shuts down.</v>

2078
01:27:45.470 --> 01:27:48.920
<v Speaker 3>But if the answer is you run away and the anxiety assistant things,</v>

2079
01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:51.770
<v Speaker 3>well that must be a Predator of some sort because otherwise why would you run</v>

2080
01:27:51.771 --> 01:27:52.550
<v Speaker 3>away?</v>

2081
01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:55.520
<v Speaker 3>And so it gets a creditor then you're afraid of it and running away.</v>

2082
01:27:55.521 --> 01:27:56.510
<v Speaker 3>And makes you more afraid.</v>

2083
01:27:56.750 --> 01:27:58.490
<v Speaker 3>So just wait it out.</v>

2084
01:27:58.700 --> 01:27:59.910
<v Speaker 3>Then you're making an event,</v>

2085
01:27:59.940 --> 01:28:00.830
<v Speaker 3>the thing you were afraid of,</v>

2086
01:28:00.890 --> 01:28:02.090
<v Speaker 3>that's what you're teaching yourself.</v>

2087
01:28:02.650 --> 01:28:05.050
<v Speaker 3>And so then maybe we'll take pictures and then you take them in the hallway and</v>

2088
01:28:05.051 --> 01:28:05.340
<v Speaker 3>you say,</v>

2089
01:28:05.340 --> 01:28:06.590
<v Speaker 3>see that elevator over there?</v>

2090
01:28:08.090 --> 01:28:11.540
<v Speaker 3>Can you stand me this close to it and say no or yes.</v>

2091
01:28:11.541 --> 01:28:12.200
<v Speaker 3>And if it's knowing,</v>

2092
01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:14.090
<v Speaker 3>say well we'll 10 feet farther back,</v>

2093
01:28:14.091 --> 01:28:14.924
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

2094
01:28:14.990 --> 01:28:17.630
<v Speaker 3>You stand there watching the and close for awhile.</v>

2095
01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:20.350
<v Speaker 3>Just imagine that you're near watching.</v>

2096
01:28:20.690 --> 01:28:22.460
<v Speaker 3>It's like you have to want to do that.</v>

2097
01:28:23.090 --> 01:28:24.890
<v Speaker 3>Keep your eyes focused on it,</v>

2098
01:28:25.220 --> 01:28:26.053
<v Speaker 3>going to look at,</v>

2099
01:28:26.570 --> 01:28:28.250
<v Speaker 3>we'll just feed that to your board.</v>

2100
01:28:28.300 --> 01:28:29.240
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't take very long.</v>

2101
01:28:29.241 --> 01:28:32.100
<v Speaker 3>Then you move closer to nine five posts and then fly.</v>

2102
01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:34.910
<v Speaker 3>Keep closer to sooner than they think.</v>

2103
01:28:35.030 --> 01:28:39.080
<v Speaker 3>Almost inevitably they're like right up on the elevator and you say,</v>

2104
01:28:39.081 --> 01:28:40.670
<v Speaker 3>well we'll let the doors open.</v>

2105
01:28:41.190 --> 01:28:42.360
<v Speaker 3>You would give you a quick look inside.</v>

2106
01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:43.230
<v Speaker 3>That would be enough for the day,</v>

2107
01:28:43.850 --> 01:28:45.350
<v Speaker 3>so it's fine.</v>

2108
01:28:45.410 --> 01:28:48.830
<v Speaker 3>So then they come back the next time and maybe the next time you say,</v>

2109
01:28:48.831 --> 01:28:49.041
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2110
01:28:49.041 --> 01:28:49.341
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2111
01:28:49.341 --> 01:28:51.800
<v Speaker 3>we're going to start a little back from where we were.</v>

2112
01:28:52.190 --> 01:28:53.130
<v Speaker 3>They have to be on here.</v>

2113
01:28:53.270 --> 01:28:54.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm in a hole,</v>

2114
01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:55.340
<v Speaker 3>opened the door,</v>

2115
01:28:56.060 --> 01:28:58.010
<v Speaker 3>and you just put your head inside and look around.</v>

2116
01:28:58.090 --> 01:28:58.750
<v Speaker 3>Look at,</v>

2117
01:28:58.750 --> 01:28:59.481
<v Speaker 3>look at the corners,</v>

2118
01:28:59.481 --> 01:29:00.314
<v Speaker 3>look at the numbers,</v>

2119
01:29:00.380 --> 01:29:02.280
<v Speaker 3>make sure you're bloody know it where you are.</v>

2120
01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:04.380
<v Speaker 3>Is it an elevated Kenny do that?</v>

2121
01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:05.490
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2122
01:29:05.490 --> 01:29:06.930
<v Speaker 3>And he's like three sessions,</v>

2123
01:29:06.931 --> 01:29:07.711
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

2124
01:29:07.711 --> 01:29:08.790
<v Speaker 3>You can get the person going down.</v>

2125
01:29:08.810 --> 01:29:10.580
<v Speaker 3>Wonderful Gentlemen speaking.</v>

2126
01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:16.450
<v Speaker 3>Now the cycle of analysts believe that if you get behavioral treatment of a</v>

2127
01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:17.390
<v Speaker 3>phobia like that,</v>

2128
01:29:17.390 --> 01:29:20.460
<v Speaker 3>the phobia would just reappear somewhere else because they thought the full view</v>

2129
01:29:20.461 --> 01:29:21.720
<v Speaker 3>of represented something deeper,</v>

2130
01:29:21.721 --> 01:29:22.830
<v Speaker 3>like fear of death,</v>

2131
01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:24.300
<v Speaker 3>which it actually does.</v>

2132
01:29:24.750 --> 01:29:27.870
<v Speaker 3>But it turns out that if you do behavioral exposure like that,</v>

2133
01:29:27.930 --> 01:29:28.763
<v Speaker 3>people</v>

2134
01:29:30.770 --> 01:29:35.770
<v Speaker 3>bravery generalizes the the doesn't bravery generalizes.</v>

2135
01:29:36.031 --> 01:29:40.960
<v Speaker 3>So one of the things that's commonly reported among women who are treated track</v>

2136
01:29:40.961 --> 01:29:43.740
<v Speaker 3>your whole game is that they start to fight with their husbands.</v>

2137
01:29:46.060 --> 01:29:48.600
<v Speaker 3>We convert the tendon right there dependent.</v>

2138
01:29:48.970 --> 01:29:51.150
<v Speaker 3>They don't want their husband to leave because they're afraid.</v>

2139
01:29:51.300 --> 01:29:53.130
<v Speaker 3>And so because they're dependent and afraid,</v>

2140
01:29:53.310 --> 01:29:54.840
<v Speaker 3>they won't put forward what they want.</v>

2141
01:29:55.350 --> 01:29:58.890
<v Speaker 3>So then if you teach them that they're actually tough enough to go into an</v>

2142
01:29:58.891 --> 01:30:02.160
<v Speaker 3>elevator despite being terrified of dying,</v>

2143
01:30:02.310 --> 01:30:04.350
<v Speaker 3>which is actually a pretty good thing to learn about yourself,</v>

2144
01:30:04.380 --> 01:30:04.531
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2145
01:30:04.531 --> 01:30:04.830
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2146
01:30:04.830 --> 01:30:05.160
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2147
01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:05.640
<v Speaker 3>the professor,</v>

2148
01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:06.450
<v Speaker 3>I can move forward,</v>

2149
01:30:06.450 --> 01:30:07.480
<v Speaker 3>just write the faculty chair.</v>

2150
01:30:07.481 --> 01:30:09.930
<v Speaker 3>Point of dying can actually still move forward.</v>

2151
01:30:10.110 --> 01:30:12.240
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's a hell of a lot more to me than I thought.</v>

2152
01:30:12.650 --> 01:30:13.530
<v Speaker 3>Once you know that,</v>

2153
01:30:13.531 --> 01:30:17.730
<v Speaker 3>then you can give in the taxi and you can take the bus and you can tell your</v>

2154
01:30:17.731 --> 01:30:20.400
<v Speaker 3>husband what the hell you wanted to tell him for the last 15 years.</v>

2155
01:30:23.010 --> 01:30:26.190
<v Speaker 3>Disruptions are secondary to the treatment,</v>

2156
01:30:26.610 --> 01:30:27.120
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2157
01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:31.410
<v Speaker 3>So the thing is is that courage generalizes and people can be unbelievably</v>

2158
01:30:31.411 --> 01:30:32.120
<v Speaker 3>courageous.</v>

2159
01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:33.120
<v Speaker 3>And funny thing is,</v>

2160
01:30:33.121 --> 01:30:36.150
<v Speaker 3>is you don't know that until you put yourself in a situation where it's demanded</v>

2161
01:30:36.151 --> 01:30:36.984
<v Speaker 3>of me.</v>

2162
01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:40.260
<v Speaker 3>And so I had another client who I,</v>

2163
01:30:40.570 --> 01:30:41.910
<v Speaker 3>who was afraid of life,</v>

2164
01:30:42.540 --> 01:30:43.770
<v Speaker 3>that's really the truth.</v>

2165
01:30:44.020 --> 01:30:45.630
<v Speaker 3>And I took her to an embalming.</v>

2166
01:30:46.570 --> 01:30:46.850
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2167
01:30:46.850 --> 01:30:49.800
<v Speaker 3>And she was so afraid of death that she couldn't go into a butcher store.</v>

2168
01:30:50.430 --> 01:30:51.320
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

2169
01:30:51.321 --> 01:30:52.154
<v Speaker 3>in a bunch of store,</v>

2170
01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:53.080
<v Speaker 3>well you think that's pretty,</v>

2171
01:30:53.390 --> 01:30:54.280
<v Speaker 3>if you really take them out,</v>

2172
01:30:54.330 --> 01:30:55.970
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty damn protest place.</v>

2173
01:30:56.190 --> 01:30:56.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

2174
01:30:56.900 --> 01:30:58.080
<v Speaker 3>it's a place of death.</v>

2175
01:30:58.081 --> 01:31:01.560
<v Speaker 3>Obviously you're blind to them or be put in the reason.</v>

2176
01:31:01.561 --> 01:31:02.540
<v Speaker 3>But she wasn't too,</v>

2177
01:31:02.910 --> 01:31:04.230
<v Speaker 3>this is a place of death.</v>

2178
01:31:04.231 --> 01:31:05.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going there.</v>

2179
01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:07.313
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

2180
01:31:08.370 --> 01:31:10.170
<v Speaker 3>the consequences of that fear,</v>

2181
01:31:10.171 --> 01:31:12.300
<v Speaker 3>we're radically and destroyed her life.</v>

2182
01:31:12.690 --> 01:31:16.190
<v Speaker 3>And she had a dream that indicated that if she didn't learn to live in the</v>

2183
01:31:16.191 --> 01:31:16.801
<v Speaker 3>slaughter house,</v>

2184
01:31:16.801 --> 01:31:17.634
<v Speaker 3>she would,</v>

2185
01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:18.930
<v Speaker 3>she wouldn't survive.</v>

2186
01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:20.260
<v Speaker 3>That's basically the shows,</v>

2187
01:31:20.300 --> 01:31:22.860
<v Speaker 3>the grievant we've boiled that down to,</v>

2188
01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:23.780
<v Speaker 3>I asked her what,</v>

2189
01:31:23.781 --> 01:31:28.781
<v Speaker 3>what could we do that would be equivalent in some sense to visiting a</v>

2190
01:31:28.801 --> 01:31:29.350
<v Speaker 3>slaughterhouse?</v>

2191
01:31:29.350 --> 01:31:30.780
<v Speaker 3>Cause that seemed to be on the question.</v>

2192
01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:31.651
<v Speaker 3>She said,</v>

2193
01:31:31.651 --> 01:31:33.090
<v Speaker 3>well I'd like to see him in bombing</v>

2194
01:31:35.610 --> 01:31:37.560
<v Speaker 3>the hell it was going to arrange that.</v>

2195
01:31:37.561 --> 01:31:42.210
<v Speaker 3>But it turns [inaudible] partner and you tell the people there and if you have</v>

2196
01:31:42.211 --> 01:31:45.660
<v Speaker 3>someone who's terrified of death and that they need to do something about that,</v>

2197
01:31:45.661 --> 01:31:49.860
<v Speaker 3>that people who work in the funeral parlor fraction point dealing with that and</v>

2198
01:31:49.861 --> 01:31:52.470
<v Speaker 3>then people would work there in incredible they do.</v>

2199
01:31:53.420 --> 01:31:55.230
<v Speaker 3>They deal with death all the time,</v>

2200
01:31:55.490 --> 01:31:55.770
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2201
01:31:55.770 --> 01:31:56.401
<v Speaker 3>All the time.</v>

2202
01:31:56.401 --> 01:32:00.880
<v Speaker 3>They deal with death and grief all the time and they do it.</v>

2203
01:32:02.940 --> 01:32:05.880
<v Speaker 3>It's unbelievable what they can do that and people who will tell you a terrible</v>

2204
01:32:05.890 --> 01:32:09.010
<v Speaker 3>words do that for people who work in emergency words and people who are</v>

2205
01:32:09.011 --> 01:32:11.210
<v Speaker 3>paramedics there like facing this,</v>

2206
01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:16.280
<v Speaker 3>why do you castrophe just never now in a never ending parade calamity.</v>

2207
01:32:17.590 --> 01:32:18.423
<v Speaker 3>And they do it.</v>

2208
01:32:18.940 --> 01:32:20.680
<v Speaker 3>It's like people are pretty damn tough.</v>

2209
01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:21.670
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2210
01:32:21.670 --> 01:32:22.503
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

2211
01:32:23.420 --> 01:32:24.910
<v Speaker 3>so that's a pretty remarkable thing.</v>

2212
01:32:25.210 --> 01:32:26.150
<v Speaker 3>And so see,</v>

2213
01:32:26.170 --> 01:32:27.650
<v Speaker 3>I need to get past with one tonight.</v>

2214
01:32:31.460 --> 01:32:32.293
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

2215
01:32:35.470 --> 01:32:37.060
<v Speaker 3>I guess each of the rules in the booker,</v>

2216
01:32:37.700 --> 01:32:38.800
<v Speaker 3>the time contain each other,</v>

2217
01:32:38.980 --> 01:32:39.950
<v Speaker 3>each other rules.</v>

2218
01:32:40.180 --> 01:32:43.270
<v Speaker 3>That's one way of thinking about the motifs are quite similar as we worked in</v>

2219
01:32:43.271 --> 01:32:48.090
<v Speaker 3>the choppers and the fundamental motif of the book is something might go wrong.</v>

2220
01:32:48.180 --> 01:32:52.450
<v Speaker 3>What I just laid out is that this is a message of optimism.</v>

2221
01:32:52.451 --> 01:32:55.060
<v Speaker 3>And I actually think this is why so many people are watching my lectures.</v>

2222
01:32:55.060 --> 01:32:55.930
<v Speaker 3>As far as I can tell,</v>

2223
01:32:57.100 --> 01:32:58.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm a dark guy,</v>

2224
01:32:58.120 --> 01:32:58.450
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2225
01:32:58.450 --> 01:33:00.580
<v Speaker 3>and I have a really optimistic idea,</v>

2226
01:33:01.180 --> 01:33:01.421
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2227
01:33:01.421 --> 01:33:02.740
<v Speaker 3>because I've spent my whole,</v>

2228
01:33:02.741 --> 01:33:06.010
<v Speaker 3>life's got in the worst possible things that people can do to each other.</v>

2229
01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:09.310
<v Speaker 3>And you're are things that people do meet each other that are so bad that you</v>

2230
01:33:09.311 --> 01:33:10.060
<v Speaker 3>just cannot,</v>

2231
01:33:10.060 --> 01:33:11.250
<v Speaker 3>you can't even imagine it.</v>

2232
01:33:11.620 --> 01:33:14.320
<v Speaker 3>And that's a rough thing to say because like we have kind of a logical</v>

2233
01:33:14.321 --> 01:33:15.154
<v Speaker 3>imaginations.</v>

2234
01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:17.050
<v Speaker 3>And if you let those some things cycle,</v>

2235
01:33:17.140 --> 01:33:19.030
<v Speaker 3>you can imagine it's a pretty dreadful things.</v>

2236
01:33:19.330 --> 01:33:20.081
<v Speaker 3>But believe me,</v>

2237
01:33:20.081 --> 01:33:22.090
<v Speaker 3>there are things that people have done to each other that,</v>

2238
01:33:22.710 --> 01:33:25.570
<v Speaker 3>that a normal person could not imagine do it.</v>

2239
01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:27.180
<v Speaker 3>And there are things I've read,</v>

2240
01:33:27.190 --> 01:33:31.120
<v Speaker 3>especially about what happened when the Japanese invaded China in World War Two</v>

2241
01:33:31.121 --> 01:33:36.121
<v Speaker 3>because are so dark that you can't read them without being permanently affected</v>

2242
01:33:36.131 --> 01:33:36.964
<v Speaker 3>by it.</v>

2243
01:33:37.030 --> 01:33:37.781
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2244
01:33:37.781 --> 01:33:40.810
<v Speaker 3>I've helped lots of people through very difficult periods of their lives and</v>

2245
01:33:41.350 --> 01:33:45.750
<v Speaker 3>spend a lot of time studying totalitarian atrocity on the right and the left,</v>

2246
01:33:45.751 --> 01:33:46.510
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

2247
01:33:46.510 --> 01:33:48.130
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty damn harsh,</v>

2248
01:33:48.670 --> 01:33:49.300
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2249
01:33:49.300 --> 01:33:53.950
<v Speaker 3>But what I've come out and from that [inaudible] Carl Young,</v>

2250
01:33:53.951 --> 01:33:54.784
<v Speaker 3>new something,</v>

2251
01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:55.750
<v Speaker 3>his Motif,</v>

2252
01:33:55.751 --> 01:33:56.790
<v Speaker 3>it was an l chemical,</v>

2253
01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:59.150
<v Speaker 3>a little team fee derived from the study about him helping me.</v>

2254
01:33:59.151 --> 01:34:00.480
<v Speaker 3>I was up lacked.</v>

2255
01:34:00.481 --> 01:34:03.520
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot to move teeth instruct William has been given a tour,</v>

2256
01:34:03.820 --> 01:34:08.080
<v Speaker 3>which means that which you most need will be filed where you least want to look.</v>

2257
01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:10.360
<v Speaker 3>And that's a hell of a tank.</v>

2258
01:34:10.570 --> 01:34:13.330
<v Speaker 3>That's the barrier to enlightenment because they think,</v>

2259
01:34:13.331 --> 01:34:15.300
<v Speaker 3>well perhaps even could be enlightened.</v>

2260
01:34:15.910 --> 01:34:16.061
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2261
01:34:16.061 --> 01:34:20.260
<v Speaker 3>what stopped me following your bliss as Joseph Campbell said,</v>

2262
01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:20.950
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2263
01:34:20.950 --> 01:34:21.970
<v Speaker 3>I guess he revised that.</v>

2264
01:34:21.971 --> 01:34:22.920
<v Speaker 3>I've heard that the other day.</v>

2265
01:34:22.921 --> 01:34:27.921
<v Speaker 3>Who a follow your blisters just actually said that knowing that you may be</v>

2266
01:34:28.031 --> 01:34:30.020
<v Speaker 3>glossed over the problem a bit too Glib,</v>

2267
01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:32.080
<v Speaker 3>but that wasn't the Carl,</v>

2268
01:34:32.081 --> 01:34:32.620
<v Speaker 3>you don't it.</v>

2269
01:34:32.620 --> 01:34:34.360
<v Speaker 3>Our idea was even new thing.</v>

2270
01:34:34.510 --> 01:34:35.350
<v Speaker 3>Do what's meaningful.</v>

2271
01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:37.360
<v Speaker 3>And truthfully we'll take him to do some really,</v>

2272
01:34:37.361 --> 01:34:40.700
<v Speaker 3>really dark places and that was straightened you the hell out.</v>

2273
01:34:41.350 --> 01:34:42.340
<v Speaker 3>And that's about right.</v>

2274
01:34:42.460 --> 01:34:47.460
<v Speaker 3>And so what I found by investigating the darkness was that it clarified the</v>

2275
01:34:47.951 --> 01:34:49.030
<v Speaker 3>light at the same time.</v>

2276
01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:50.171
<v Speaker 3>It makes sense,</v>

2277
01:34:50.171 --> 01:34:50.441
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2278
01:34:50.441 --> 01:34:51.760
<v Speaker 3>Because it makes sense.</v>

2279
01:34:52.060 --> 01:34:54.610
<v Speaker 3>How could you understand good and you've got to understand that evil.</v>

2280
01:34:55.270 --> 01:35:00.270
<v Speaker 3>And if you don't think there's evil though and God help you because one day and</v>

2281
01:35:02.180 --> 01:35:03.680
<v Speaker 3>they will tear you into pieces.</v>

2282
01:35:04.070 --> 01:35:06.620
<v Speaker 3>And that happens to people far more frequently than you think.</v>

2283
01:35:06.830 --> 01:35:08.060
<v Speaker 3>In my clinical experience,</v>

2284
01:35:08.061 --> 01:35:13.061
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen someone with posttraumatic stress post traumatic stress disorder</v>

2285
01:35:13.790 --> 01:35:15.430
<v Speaker 3>who hadn't encountered people.</v>

2286
01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:20.540
<v Speaker 3>That's what causes post traumatic stress disorder is a trauma.</v>

2287
01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:23.000
<v Speaker 3>Kids fall and break the makes.</v>

2288
01:35:23.001 --> 01:35:24.860
<v Speaker 3>They don't get post traumatic stress disorder.</v>

2289
01:35:25.340 --> 01:35:25.730
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

2290
01:35:25.730 --> 01:35:26.150
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2291
01:35:26.150 --> 01:35:29.660
<v Speaker 3>you're naive on some part of your life and you hit someone who's MLevel.</v>

2292
01:35:29.810 --> 01:35:30.800
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's you,</v>

2293
01:35:31.310 --> 01:35:34.940
<v Speaker 3>because that's often across a posttraumatic stress disorder to among soldiers in</v>

2294
01:35:34.941 --> 01:35:35.720
<v Speaker 3>particular,</v>

2295
01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:39.590
<v Speaker 3>they watched themselves to a sub doing something they cannot imagine that they</v>

2296
01:35:39.591 --> 01:35:41.410
<v Speaker 3>could do and they do it.</v>

2297
01:35:42.290 --> 01:35:43.400
<v Speaker 3>They never recovered from that.</v>

2298
01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:44.953
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2299
01:35:46.370 --> 01:35:51.290
<v Speaker 3>so we know the world is a tragic place and it's a level of place and we each</v>

2300
01:35:51.291 --> 01:35:54.980
<v Speaker 3>have our personal tragedy in our family tragedy and reach carriers of</v>

2301
01:35:54.981 --> 01:35:55.820
<v Speaker 3>malevolence and,</v>

2302
01:35:56.110 --> 01:35:56.900
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2303
01:35:56.900 --> 01:35:57.710
<v Speaker 3>and recipients,</v>

2304
01:35:57.710 --> 01:35:58.010
<v Speaker 3>Sukkot.</v>

2305
01:35:58.010 --> 01:36:00.240
<v Speaker 3>And that's the landscape of reality in a sense.</v>

2306
01:36:00.470 --> 01:36:01.700
<v Speaker 3>But there are,</v>

2307
01:36:02.420 --> 01:36:07.420
<v Speaker 3>there are modes of conducting yourself in the world that are more powerful then</v>

2308
01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:13.370
<v Speaker 3>tragedy and evil and those involved courage.</v>

2309
01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:16.460
<v Speaker 3>So that's the first thing that the courage is something like the willingness to</v>

2310
01:36:17.090 --> 01:36:21.890
<v Speaker 3>voluntarily take on the burden of the tragedy and the level to accept it rather</v>

2311
01:36:21.891 --> 01:36:22.730
<v Speaker 3>than to fight it,</v>

2312
01:36:23.340 --> 01:36:25.100
<v Speaker 3>except as a condition of being.</v>

2313
01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:26.000
<v Speaker 3>It's something like that.</v>

2314
01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:28.080
<v Speaker 3>You have to accept it as a condition of being.</v>

2315
01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:29.750
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2316
01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:34.750
<v Speaker 3>I read this really interesting old Jewish all monetary years ago.</v>

2317
01:36:35.571 --> 01:36:36.710
<v Speaker 3>I don't even remember the source,</v>

2318
01:36:36.711 --> 01:36:40.700
<v Speaker 3>but it was one of the most brilliant things I've ever read that the commentator</v>

2319
01:36:41.390 --> 01:36:42.171
<v Speaker 3>was discussing.</v>

2320
01:36:42.171 --> 01:36:43.790
<v Speaker 3>The classical attributes of God,</v>

2321
01:36:44.030 --> 01:36:44.721
<v Speaker 3>omniscience,</v>

2322
01:36:44.721 --> 01:36:45.554
<v Speaker 3>omnipotence,</v>

2323
01:36:45.860 --> 01:36:46.693
<v Speaker 3>omnipresence,</v>

2324
01:36:47.050 --> 01:36:47.990
<v Speaker 3>so that's everything.</v>

2325
01:36:47.991 --> 01:36:48.824
<v Speaker 3>Fundamentally,</v>

2326
01:36:48.870 --> 01:36:51.500
<v Speaker 3>the question was what does it being,</v>

2327
01:36:51.501 --> 01:36:52.310
<v Speaker 3>it's omniscient,</v>

2328
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:53.143
<v Speaker 3>omnipresent,</v>

2329
01:36:53.570 --> 01:36:54.980
<v Speaker 3>and omniscient.</v>

2330
01:36:55.310 --> 01:36:57.860
<v Speaker 3>Black and obvious answers.</v>

2331
01:36:58.640 --> 01:36:59.473
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>

2332
01:37:00.170 --> 01:37:01.250
<v Speaker 3>That's not the correct answer.</v>

2333
01:37:01.251 --> 01:37:02.660
<v Speaker 3>The correct answer is a limitation.</v>

2334
01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:05.600
<v Speaker 3>That's so amazing.</v>

2335
01:37:05.690 --> 01:37:10.670
<v Speaker 3>That's an amazing thing is that limitation has advantages that totality lacks</v>

2336
01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:12.760
<v Speaker 3>limitation in,</v>

2337
01:37:12.761 --> 01:37:14.120
<v Speaker 3>so something to struggle against.</v>

2338
01:37:14.121 --> 01:37:14.980
<v Speaker 3>Limitation Needs.</v>

2339
01:37:15.010 --> 01:37:16.220
<v Speaker 3>There's a place to go.</v>

2340
01:37:16.670 --> 01:37:17.503
<v Speaker 3>There's an op,</v>

2341
01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:18.560
<v Speaker 3>there's a story,</v>

2342
01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:19.520
<v Speaker 3>here's an adventure.</v>

2343
01:37:19.550 --> 01:37:21.050
<v Speaker 3>All of that requires an invitation,</v>

2344
01:37:21.290 --> 01:37:22.000
<v Speaker 3>not it's life.</v>

2345
01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:22.730
<v Speaker 3>It's an,</v>

2346
01:37:22.730 --> 01:37:26.100
<v Speaker 3>it's an adventure of sorts and it's like it's a terrible venture.</v>

2347
01:37:26.101 --> 01:37:29.780
<v Speaker 3>It's a high stakes adventure because you're all in and down whether you like it</v>

2348
01:37:29.781 --> 01:37:30.320
<v Speaker 3>or not.</v>

2349
01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:31.153
<v Speaker 3>You're all in.</v>

2350
01:37:32.090 --> 01:37:32.990
<v Speaker 3>That's the adventure.</v>

2351
01:37:33.130 --> 01:37:33.831
<v Speaker 3>Then the question is,</v>

2352
01:37:33.831 --> 01:37:35.900
<v Speaker 3>what is it worth it and then the crest,</v>

2353
01:37:35.990 --> 01:37:37.900
<v Speaker 3>the answer that might be looked depends on the quest,</v>

2354
01:37:38.750 --> 01:37:39.020
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2355
01:37:39.020 --> 01:37:39.920
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's the answer.</v>

2356
01:37:39.921 --> 01:37:41.570
<v Speaker 3>It's like if the quest is sufficient,</v>

2357
01:37:41.571 --> 01:37:43.340
<v Speaker 3>then the adventure is worth it.</v>

2358
01:37:44.030 --> 01:37:47.120
<v Speaker 3>And so that's the only optimistic talk that I've ever come across that actually</v>

2359
01:37:47.121 --> 01:37:47.954
<v Speaker 3>believe</v>

2360
01:37:49.180 --> 01:37:50.120
<v Speaker 3>that could be true.</v>

2361
01:37:50.470 --> 01:37:51.710
<v Speaker 3>It seems like that if,</v>

2362
01:37:51.860 --> 01:37:52.640
<v Speaker 3>if you live that out,</v>

2363
01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:52.991
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

2364
01:37:52.991 --> 01:37:53.261
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2365
01:37:53.261 --> 01:37:56.000
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you have these where you pick off was really worthwhile.</v>

2366
01:37:56.720 --> 01:37:57.070
<v Speaker 3>Anything.</v>

2367
01:37:57.070 --> 01:37:58.080
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>

2368
01:37:58.570 --> 01:37:58.800
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2369
01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:02.640
<v Speaker 3>despite the terrible preconditions of Ba,</v>

2370
01:38:03.810 --> 01:38:06.180
<v Speaker 3>that seemed to announce itself as valuable.</v>

2371
01:38:06.450 --> 01:38:06.721
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2372
01:38:06.721 --> 01:38:09.150
<v Speaker 3>well what if that was your pursuit periods you can file.</v>

2373
01:38:09.151 --> 01:38:13.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to pursue what I regard as the most valuable thing,</v>

2374
01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:17.670
<v Speaker 3>going to dedicate myself towards that so that I have the adventure of my life</v>

2375
01:38:17.790 --> 01:38:21.360
<v Speaker 3>that justifies the suffering of my life and the malevolence.</v>

2376
01:38:21.361 --> 01:38:26.040
<v Speaker 3>That's part and parcel of part and parcel of the discuss the aim so far up that</v>

2377
01:38:26.041 --> 01:38:27.210
<v Speaker 3>the trip is worthwhile.</v>

2378
01:38:29.390 --> 01:38:34.390
<v Speaker 3>There's absolutely every reason to believe that that's a proper answer like it</v>

2379
01:38:37.471 --> 01:38:38.400
<v Speaker 3>looks like it is.</v>

2380
01:38:38.510 --> 01:38:40.050
<v Speaker 3>What would be great stories say,</v>

2381
01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:41.191
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2382
01:38:41.191 --> 01:38:42.720
<v Speaker 3>that's what the great efforts to say.</v>

2383
01:38:43.230 --> 01:38:46.920
<v Speaker 3>That's what the archetypes demonstrate.</v>

2384
01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:49.560
<v Speaker 3>That's what the neurobiology suggests.</v>

2385
01:38:49.890 --> 01:38:51.420
<v Speaker 3>That's what our agenda is,</v>

2386
01:38:51.421 --> 01:38:56.280
<v Speaker 3>to produce political structures that are stable and relationships that work</v>

2387
01:38:56.400 --> 01:38:59.010
<v Speaker 3>suggested because you treat each other in a relationship.</v>

2388
01:38:59.011 --> 01:38:59.844
<v Speaker 3>Because if,</v>

2389
01:38:59.850 --> 01:39:00.720
<v Speaker 3>if you love someone,</v>

2390
01:39:00.721 --> 01:39:04.060
<v Speaker 3>you treat that person as if the adventure of their life is worthwhile.</v>

2391
01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:05.011
<v Speaker 3>If something like that,</v>

2392
01:39:05.011 --> 01:39:05.711
<v Speaker 3>he wouldn't love him.</v>

2393
01:39:05.711 --> 01:39:07.530
<v Speaker 3>If he didn't think that would do,</v>

2394
01:39:07.550 --> 01:39:07.860
<v Speaker 3>you would,</v>

2395
01:39:07.860 --> 01:39:10.590
<v Speaker 3>if you didn't think it was worthwhile for them to be,</v>

2396
01:39:10.620 --> 01:39:11.530
<v Speaker 3>you would love them.</v>

2397
01:39:11.531 --> 01:39:12.820
<v Speaker 3>And so it's,</v>

2398
01:39:13.030 --> 01:39:14.760
<v Speaker 3>it's a judgment call you make.</v>

2399
01:39:15.030 --> 01:39:15.361
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2400
01:39:15.361 --> 01:39:17.510
<v Speaker 3>well it seems to me that it's a big time for everybody.</v>

2401
01:39:17.530 --> 01:39:22.290
<v Speaker 3>Wake up and realize that life is terrible and worse than you can possibly</v>

2402
01:39:22.291 --> 01:39:22.700
<v Speaker 3>imagine.</v>

2403
01:39:22.700 --> 01:39:23.510
<v Speaker 3>The history,</v>

2404
01:39:23.510 --> 01:39:25.710
<v Speaker 3>absolutely mad house tasks,</v>

2405
01:39:26.580 --> 01:39:31.580
<v Speaker 3>but the nobility of the human spirit and the power of courage and truth is</v>

2406
01:39:32.791 --> 01:39:36.390
<v Speaker 3>sufficient to to transcend all of that.</v>

2407
01:39:36.450 --> 01:39:38.460
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's true individually,</v>

2408
01:39:38.461 --> 01:39:39.870
<v Speaker 3>like in the confines of your own life.</v>

2409
01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:43.740
<v Speaker 3>I think it's true for your family because you can have a beneficial effect on</v>

2410
01:39:43.741 --> 01:39:44.520
<v Speaker 3>your family.</v>

2411
01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:47.730
<v Speaker 3>I think it's true for you in relationship to the community.</v>

2412
01:39:47.910 --> 01:39:52.910
<v Speaker 3>And I have a sneaking suspicion now and this is when my thought goes beyond its</v>

2413
01:39:52.951 --> 01:39:57.500
<v Speaker 3>ability to justify itself because it's more of an intermission or founded</v>

2414
01:39:57.501 --> 01:39:58.320
<v Speaker 3>tuition,</v>

2415
01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:02.520
<v Speaker 3>but you can set yourself together so well and if you start pulling other things</v>

2416
01:40:02.730 --> 01:40:06.700
<v Speaker 3>outside of the family and the community together properly around it.</v>

2417
01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:09.340
<v Speaker 3>So they started to line up so that everything starts to alignment,</v>

2418
01:40:09.350 --> 01:40:12.540
<v Speaker 3>Blaine up and come together like something symphonic.</v>

2419
01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:17.220
<v Speaker 3>And we don't understand the relationship between consciousness and reality very</v>

2420
01:40:17.221 --> 01:40:17.450
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

2421
01:40:17.450 --> 01:40:20.940
<v Speaker 3>Cause obviously you're a reciprocal relationship and it's possible that each of</v>

2422
01:40:20.941 --> 01:40:24.960
<v Speaker 3>us play a much more fundamental role in the structure of being than any of us</v>

2423
01:40:24.961 --> 01:40:26.130
<v Speaker 3>really realize.</v>

2424
01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:27.353
<v Speaker 3>We're certainly,</v>

2425
01:40:28.020 --> 01:40:30.990
<v Speaker 3>we certainly are far more than we can understand.</v>

2426
01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:33.030
<v Speaker 3>What the hell do we know about themselves?</v>

2427
01:40:33.050 --> 01:40:34.140
<v Speaker 3>What's important help to get?</v>

2428
01:40:34.141 --> 01:40:35.900
<v Speaker 3>It's just like,</v>

2429
01:40:35.910 --> 01:40:36.930
<v Speaker 3>what are we exactly.</v>

2430
01:40:37.950 --> 01:40:42.950
<v Speaker 3>Well I'd be fun to find out and the alternative seems to be some bit of Kale and</v>

2431
01:40:44.431 --> 01:40:46.130
<v Speaker 3>so you know why not a,</v>

2432
01:40:48.300 --> 01:40:50.640
<v Speaker 3>so it's probably a good place to stop.</v>

2433
01:40:50.690 --> 01:40:51.061
<v Speaker 3>And we say,</v>

2434
01:40:51.061 --> 01:40:52.380
<v Speaker 3>well why the hell not eight months?</v>

2435
01:40:53.910 --> 01:40:54.060
<v Speaker 3>That</v>

2436
01:40:54.060 --> 01:40:54.670
<v Speaker 1>would be really good.</v>

2437
01:40:54.670 --> 01:40:56.050
<v Speaker 1>And I think everybody's ready for it.</v>

2438
01:40:56.051 --> 01:40:58.240
<v Speaker 1>So let's let you go do it.</v>

2439
01:40:58.390 --> 01:40:59.350
<v Speaker 1>Truth and courage.</v>

2440
01:40:59.540 --> 01:41:00.550
<v Speaker 1>That would be a good thing.</v>

2441
01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:01.793
<v Speaker 1>So thank you.</v>

2442
01:41:02.650 --> 01:41:07.650
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2443
01:42:58.950 --> 01:43:00.780
<v Speaker 1>never talked your mom.</v>

2444
01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:08.280
<v Speaker 1>So when you go in front of a crowd in silence until everyone from little bit</v>

2445
01:43:09.730 --> 01:43:10.563
<v Speaker 1>wondering,</v>

2446
01:43:15.270 --> 01:43:15.870
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2447
01:43:15.870 --> 01:43:16.703
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

2448
01:43:20.020 --> 01:43:22.980
<v Speaker 1>you won't know whether it be</v>

2449
01:43:25.070 --> 01:43:26.010
<v Speaker 1>do to the questions.</v>

2450
01:43:26.030 --> 01:43:26.863
<v Speaker 1>We can have more room.</v>

2451
01:43:48.950 --> 01:43:49.930
<v Speaker 1>That's where you have to drink.</v>

2452
01:43:49.940 --> 01:43:50.910
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2453
01:44:03.130 --> 01:44:07.200
<v Speaker 1>there have been moments where I've had brief spells,</v>

2454
01:44:07.980 --> 01:44:09.100
<v Speaker 1>sort of bliss</v>

2455
01:44:10.660 --> 01:44:14.210
<v Speaker 1>and it's really easy for me to be cynical because when I'm there I'm always</v>

2456
01:44:14.211 --> 01:44:15.100
<v Speaker 1>looking at people and think,</v>

2457
01:44:16.450 --> 01:44:17.283
<v Speaker 1>oh it's just switching.</v>

2458
01:44:17.380 --> 01:44:18.730
<v Speaker 1>It's found a good wave or</v>

2459
01:44:20.930 --> 01:44:21.521
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

2460
01:44:21.521 --> 01:44:25.670
<v Speaker 1>But there might be something where it's like,</v>

2461
01:44:26.170 --> 01:44:27.880
<v Speaker 1>it's like a dark spot on the map.</v>

2462
01:44:28.940 --> 01:44:31.490
<v Speaker 1>And so I was wondering more generally,</v>

2463
01:44:31.491 --> 01:44:35.860
<v Speaker 1>how can you distinguish between a cave that's empty and became the head of the</v>

2464
01:44:35.861 --> 01:44:40.861
<v Speaker 1>dragon in it and also what you've generally three to buy my books [inaudible]</v>

2465
01:44:49.861 --> 01:44:50.694
<v Speaker 1>books,</v>

2466
01:44:51.010 --> 01:44:52.230
<v Speaker 1>they're more of a microcosm,</v>

2467
01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:08.190
<v Speaker 1>probably generally in favor of the</v>

2468
01:45:11.460 --> 01:45:16.460
<v Speaker 1>dangerous mean alcohol is dangerous and sex is dangerous and all of that,</v>

2469
01:45:16.791 --> 01:45:20.650
<v Speaker 1>but we can't regulate any of that too tightly because pending regulation it's be</v>

2470
01:45:20.660 --> 01:45:22.030
<v Speaker 1>more dangerous than the danger.</v>

2471
01:45:22.900 --> 01:45:24.050
<v Speaker 1>That's the big girl.</v>

2472
01:45:27.680 --> 01:45:30.120
<v Speaker 1>One possible solution to that</v>

2473
01:45:32.210 --> 01:45:33.043
<v Speaker 1>is</v>

2474
01:45:34.590 --> 01:45:36.300
<v Speaker 1>there's a chapter in this book,</v>

2475
01:45:36.870 --> 01:45:39.620
<v Speaker 1>this chapter can be precise in your speech,</v>

2476
01:45:40.420 --> 01:45:41.390
<v Speaker 1>and it was a fun chapter,</v>

2477
01:45:41.391 --> 01:45:41.781
<v Speaker 1>Greg,</v>

2478
01:45:41.781 --> 01:45:42.950
<v Speaker 1>because it's a</v>

2479
01:45:44.630 --> 01:45:49.630
<v Speaker 1>description of how what you're aiming app determines your world and I didn't</v>

2480
01:45:53.361 --> 01:45:54.194
<v Speaker 1>want me,</v>

2481
01:45:54.220 --> 01:45:55.730
<v Speaker 1>and that's kind of a metaphor you know,</v>

2482
01:45:56.200 --> 01:45:57.033
<v Speaker 1>is to lead,</v>

2483
01:45:57.230 --> 01:45:58.063
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

2484
01:45:58.820 --> 01:46:02.270
<v Speaker 1>the reality that you wouldn't have heard is Maya or illusion that you're</v>

2485
01:46:02.271 --> 01:46:05.270
<v Speaker 1>suffering as a consequence of being mired in that illusion.</v>

2486
01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:08.510
<v Speaker 1>And there's some real truth to that because</v>

2487
01:46:10.430 --> 01:46:12.920
<v Speaker 1>one does determine how the world manifest itself.</v>

2488
01:46:14.070 --> 01:46:14.870
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2489
01:46:14.870 --> 01:46:16.120
<v Speaker 1>it's not the only determinant,</v>

2490
01:46:16.350 --> 01:46:16.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2491
01:46:16.590 --> 01:46:18.450
<v Speaker 1>because we really are limited in some ways,</v>

2492
01:46:18.470 --> 01:46:19.303
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2493
01:46:19.790 --> 01:46:20.690
<v Speaker 1>We can bouncing along.</v>

2494
01:46:20.691 --> 01:46:21.890
<v Speaker 1>Quite happy with leaving everything,</v>

2495
01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:22.753
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2496
01:46:22.980 --> 01:46:23.330
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2497
01:46:23.330 --> 01:46:25.550
<v Speaker 1>there's an earthquake in that telling falls on you.</v>

2498
01:46:25.551 --> 01:46:26.470
<v Speaker 1>And that's the exact,</v>

2499
01:46:26.900 --> 01:46:29.450
<v Speaker 1>so what can you founded by your mortality of,</v>

2500
01:46:29.451 --> 01:46:30.560
<v Speaker 1>within that you have,</v>

2501
01:46:32.190 --> 01:46:33.023
<v Speaker 1>what would you say?</v>

2502
01:46:33.620 --> 01:46:38.620
<v Speaker 1>You have a landscape shorts and then the way that landscape manifests itself</v>

2503
01:46:40.890 --> 01:46:45.170
<v Speaker 1>isn't no trivial manner determined what you're aiming at.</v>

2504
01:46:46.190 --> 01:46:47.720
<v Speaker 1>So there's a story in that chapter,</v>

2505
01:46:47.721 --> 01:46:48.554
<v Speaker 1>but this woman,</v>

2506
01:46:49.620 --> 01:46:49.980
<v Speaker 1>she needs</v>

2507
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:51.610
<v Speaker 2>a psychiatrist at a party,</v>

2508
01:46:51.860 --> 01:46:55.700
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly from a play called the car feel party by DSL.</v>

2509
01:46:55.760 --> 01:46:56.593
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2510
01:46:57.030 --> 01:46:59.770
<v Speaker 2>She tells the psychiatrist that her life is going very well,</v>

2511
01:46:59.771 --> 01:47:01.770
<v Speaker 2>but she's suffering and you know,</v>

2512
01:47:01.771 --> 01:47:06.480
<v Speaker 2>thinking dark thoughts about how terrible things are and she's hoping that he</v>

2513
01:47:06.481 --> 01:47:07.081
<v Speaker 2>could help her.</v>

2514
01:47:07.081 --> 01:47:08.130
<v Speaker 2>But before</v>

2515
01:47:09.630 --> 01:47:10.411
<v Speaker 2>she gets to that,</v>

2516
01:47:10.411 --> 01:47:11.244
<v Speaker 2>she says,</v>

2517
01:47:11.940 --> 01:47:15.510
<v Speaker 2>I really hope there's something wrong with 10 the sidecar just says,</v>

2518
01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:15.990
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2519
01:47:15.990 --> 01:47:16.823
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean?</v>

2520
01:47:16.830 --> 01:47:17.130
<v Speaker 2>What do you,</v>

2521
01:47:17.130 --> 01:47:18.460
<v Speaker 2>why do you hope there's something wrong with him?</v>

2522
01:47:18.470 --> 01:47:19.410
<v Speaker 2>Because she says,</v>

2523
01:47:19.411 --> 01:47:19.801
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>

2524
01:47:19.801 --> 01:47:21.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm suffering badly.</v>

2525
01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:23.670
<v Speaker 2>And as far as I can tell,</v>

2526
01:47:23.671 --> 01:47:25.230
<v Speaker 2>there's only two possible reasons for that.</v>

2527
01:47:25.231 --> 01:47:27.390
<v Speaker 2>One is something wrong with the world.</v>

2528
01:47:27.391 --> 01:47:29.940
<v Speaker 2>And I'm just stuck with that and hence the suffering.</v>

2529
01:47:29.970 --> 01:47:33.450
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe there's something wrong with me and that would be way better because</v>

2530
01:47:33.451 --> 01:47:34.284
<v Speaker 2>then I get both.</v>

2531
01:47:34.380 --> 01:47:35.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to fix the world.</v>

2532
01:47:35.720 --> 01:47:36.400
<v Speaker 2>I can pull cash.</v>

2533
01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:37.440
<v Speaker 2>We fixed me.</v>

2534
01:47:37.441 --> 01:47:39.180
<v Speaker 2>And in some of the suffering that go away,</v>

2535
01:47:39.690 --> 01:47:40.290
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2536
01:47:40.290 --> 01:47:41.670
<v Speaker 2>and then when I read that,</v>

2537
01:47:41.730 --> 01:47:45.780
<v Speaker 2>I also thought about what happened repeatedly in the old testament because what</v>

2538
01:47:45.781 --> 01:47:49.170
<v Speaker 2>happened to the old testament repeatedly is that the Israelites kind of get</v>

2539
01:47:49.171 --> 01:47:50.004
<v Speaker 2>their act together.</v>

2540
01:47:50.370 --> 01:47:50.830
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2541
01:47:50.830 --> 01:47:51.900
<v Speaker 2>we sort of get things going.</v>

2542
01:47:51.910 --> 01:47:52.920
<v Speaker 2>Then they get all arrogant,</v>

2543
01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:54.350
<v Speaker 2>started breaking roles,</v>

2544
01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:59.400
<v Speaker 2>and then God comes along and just walks them centuries lacking.</v>

2545
01:47:59.830 --> 01:48:03.190
<v Speaker 2>Then they gonna slowly get themselves off the floor,</v>

2546
01:48:03.810 --> 01:48:04.650
<v Speaker 2>climb up again,</v>

2547
01:48:04.670 --> 01:48:05.650
<v Speaker 2>and then they get all arrogant.</v>

2548
01:48:06.150 --> 01:48:07.380
<v Speaker 2>They're flat and again.</v>

2549
01:48:07.470 --> 01:48:10.660
<v Speaker 2>But what's really interesting is for the rise in the flatmates,</v>

2550
01:48:10.680 --> 01:48:12.810
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of part and parcel of life,</v>

2551
01:48:12.811 --> 01:48:14.700
<v Speaker 2>but the Israelites to response to that,</v>

2552
01:48:14.730 --> 01:48:16.800
<v Speaker 2>which is always to blame themselves and not go up.</v>

2553
01:48:17.630 --> 01:48:20.820
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the things that makes that book so unbelievably rock solid as the</v>

2554
01:48:20.830 --> 01:48:25.800
<v Speaker 2>hazard lights always think no catastrophe because we didn't do things great</v>

2555
01:48:26.700 --> 01:48:28.710
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe because we didn't do things right.</v>

2556
01:48:28.770 --> 01:48:30.750
<v Speaker 2>It's like even if that's not true,</v>

2557
01:48:31.550 --> 01:48:32.910
<v Speaker 2>yes it is true,</v>

2558
01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:34.470
<v Speaker 2>but even if it's not true,</v>

2559
01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:36.060
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's pretty good attitude.</v>

2560
01:48:36.860 --> 01:48:38.250
<v Speaker 2>It's a pretty good attitude to have.</v>

2561
01:48:38.251 --> 01:48:38.600
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2562
01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:42.430
<v Speaker 2>well you know even I have noticed this when people are negotiating with their</v>

2563
01:48:42.930 --> 01:48:46.650
<v Speaker 2>partner to say it's like if you're having a real dispute with your partner,</v>

2564
01:48:46.860 --> 01:48:50.610
<v Speaker 2>one really effective technique is to separate cause like you have this dispute,</v>

2565
01:48:50.670 --> 01:48:53.190
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to hammer each other's like separate,</v>

2566
01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:54.930
<v Speaker 2>go sit on a bed somewhere and think,</v>

2567
01:48:54.931 --> 01:48:55.764
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2568
01:48:56.880 --> 01:49:00.470
<v Speaker 2>despite the fact that I'm married to the most annoying person in the world and</v>

2569
01:49:02.940 --> 01:49:03.900
<v Speaker 2>in this instance,</v>

2570
01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:08.610
<v Speaker 2>is there anything that I've done no matter how trivial in the last months that</v>

2571
01:49:08.850 --> 01:49:12.060
<v Speaker 2>have made this stupid situation or probable.</v>

2572
01:49:12.750 --> 01:49:14.700
<v Speaker 2>And like if you ask yourself that question,</v>

2573
01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:19.760
<v Speaker 2>take about 15 seconds to figure out other dumb things you've done the optimum,</v>

2574
01:49:20.340 --> 01:49:24.180
<v Speaker 2>they'll come forward pretty much in a never ending stream.</v>

2575
01:49:25.100 --> 01:49:27.300
<v Speaker 2>If people tell your partner,</v>

2576
01:49:27.510 --> 01:49:27.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2577
01:49:27.960 --> 01:49:28.793
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2578
01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:31.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm not very far with you at the moment and for sure you're wrong,</v>

2579
01:49:31.561 --> 01:49:34.710
<v Speaker 2>but here's some really stupid things I've done.</v>

2580
01:49:35.010 --> 01:49:35.610
<v Speaker 2>Then they're,</v>

2581
01:49:35.610 --> 01:49:39.260
<v Speaker 2>they tend to be a lot happier with you if you do the same thing.</v>

2582
01:49:39.410 --> 01:49:41.130
<v Speaker 2>We tend to be a lot happier with them.</v>

2583
01:49:41.340 --> 01:49:45.660
<v Speaker 2>So there's some utility in figuring out what it is that you're doing to muck up</v>

2584
01:49:45.661 --> 01:49:46.291
<v Speaker 2>the situation.</v>

2585
01:49:46.291 --> 01:49:49.770
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things I would say with regards to the nightclub situations,</v>

2586
01:49:50.260 --> 01:49:55.060
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's miserable because what you want when you go there isn't right.</v>

2587
01:49:56.080 --> 01:49:57.430
<v Speaker 2>And so what I would say like,</v>

2588
01:49:57.431 --> 01:49:59.710
<v Speaker 2>and if we were talking about this in a therapy session,</v>

2589
01:49:59.740 --> 01:50:00.341
<v Speaker 2>like I would say,</v>

2590
01:50:00.341 --> 01:50:01.150
<v Speaker 2>well let's,</v>

2591
01:50:01.150 --> 01:50:03.910
<v Speaker 2>let's lay out what it is that you're searching for.</v>

2592
01:50:03.911 --> 01:50:05.740
<v Speaker 2>When you go there and you could write,</v>

2593
01:50:05.741 --> 01:50:08.710
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to kind of write approximations because you might not actually know.</v>

2594
01:50:08.740 --> 01:50:09.820
<v Speaker 2>You kind of have some idea,</v>

2595
01:50:09.821 --> 01:50:10.810
<v Speaker 2>but you wouldn't exactly know.</v>

2596
01:50:10.811 --> 01:50:11.171
<v Speaker 2>It's okay,</v>

2597
01:50:11.171 --> 01:50:13.180
<v Speaker 2>let's figure out what it is that you're after.</v>

2598
01:50:14.100 --> 01:50:14.481
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>

2599
01:50:14.481 --> 01:50:16.690
<v Speaker 2>You got a bunch of things that you could be after otherwise.</v>

2600
01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:20.800
<v Speaker 2>And then let's send you to the nightclub and 10 times and with these different</v>

2601
01:50:20.801 --> 01:50:22.540
<v Speaker 2>attitudes in mind and see what happens.</v>

2602
01:50:22.690 --> 01:50:24.820
<v Speaker 2>That's called collaborative empiricism by the way.</v>

2603
01:50:24.821 --> 01:50:26.770
<v Speaker 2>It's a behavioral technique and it's a good one.</v>

2604
01:50:27.130 --> 01:50:27.850
<v Speaker 2>So I would say,</v>

2605
01:50:27.850 --> 01:50:30.370
<v Speaker 2>well vary your approach.</v>

2606
01:50:31.510 --> 01:50:31.721
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2607
01:50:31.721 --> 01:50:32.680
<v Speaker 2>maybe your approach wasn't,</v>

2608
01:50:32.690 --> 01:50:34.900
<v Speaker 2>I could meet to well to,</v>

2609
01:50:34.901 --> 01:50:36.100
<v Speaker 2>to you know,</v>

2610
01:50:36.101 --> 01:50:38.560
<v Speaker 2>to dance 30% more than you usually would.</v>

2611
01:50:39.130 --> 01:50:40.690
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to leave everything out of it.</v>

2612
01:50:40.990 --> 01:50:41.900
<v Speaker 2>Everything else out of it,</v>

2613
01:50:41.901 --> 01:50:42.340
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2614
01:50:42.340 --> 01:50:42.881
<v Speaker 2>It can't be,</v>

2615
01:50:42.881 --> 01:50:43.714
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2616
01:50:43.780 --> 01:50:47.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to find a partner for casual sex and that's really my end,</v>

2617
01:50:48.010 --> 01:50:53.010
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to pretend that my aim is to dance like 30% no wrong jack,</v>

2618
01:50:53.950 --> 01:50:57.450
<v Speaker 2>you haven't played the game strength or maybe it's to have three engaging</v>

2619
01:50:57.460 --> 01:50:58.150
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>

2620
01:50:58.150 --> 01:51:01.720
<v Speaker 2>So if you could quantify it like that and it's kind of trait in some sense,</v>

2621
01:51:01.721 --> 01:51:05.500
<v Speaker 2>but you're obviously not a pro at the nightclub while you're on this mission</v>

2622
01:51:05.530 --> 01:51:07.510
<v Speaker 2>because it's not working out for you the way and didn't mind.</v>

2623
01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:12.130
<v Speaker 2>So are you're saying change your goals and see what happens.</v>

2624
01:51:12.910 --> 01:51:17.410
<v Speaker 2>So because perhaps what to pursuing there isn't the right thing to pursue.</v>

2625
01:51:18.280 --> 01:51:19.290
<v Speaker 2>It's highly grown,</v>

2626
01:51:19.560 --> 01:51:20.070
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2627
01:51:20.070 --> 01:51:25.070
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

2628
01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:28.691
<v Speaker 2>I'd like,</v>

2629
01:51:28.691 --> 01:51:31.030
<v Speaker 2>it isn't obvious what you should be pursuing them,</v>

2630
01:51:31.540 --> 01:51:32.720
<v Speaker 2>but then I would say it's true.</v>

2631
01:51:32.920 --> 01:51:33.830
<v Speaker 2>It's because,</v>

2632
01:51:34.030 --> 01:51:35.830
<v Speaker 2>and I was very complex landscape,</v>

2633
01:51:35.910 --> 01:51:36.131
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2634
01:51:36.131 --> 01:51:36.820
<v Speaker 2>It's uh,</v>

2635
01:51:36.820 --> 01:51:39.940
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing the mark and it's,</v>

2636
01:51:39.941 --> 01:51:40.900
<v Speaker 2>it's accelerating.</v>

2637
01:51:40.901 --> 01:51:42.300
<v Speaker 2>Maybe market some sense.</v>

2638
01:51:42.380 --> 01:51:42.731
<v Speaker 2>You might say,</v>

2639
01:51:42.731 --> 01:51:42.851
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2640
01:51:42.851 --> 01:51:46.090
<v Speaker 2>what's on the optimal behavior and the landscape that's an accelerator mating</v>

2641
01:51:46.091 --> 01:51:46.924
<v Speaker 2>market.</v>

2642
01:51:47.410 --> 01:51:48.660
<v Speaker 2>Well that's,</v>

2643
01:51:48.970 --> 01:51:50.710
<v Speaker 2>you can think about that for five years.</v>

2644
01:51:51.250 --> 01:51:53.530
<v Speaker 2>The pickup harvest types are trying to figure that out too,</v>

2645
01:51:53.531 --> 01:51:58.360
<v Speaker 2>but because they felt they knew is manifesting a persona that's associated with</v>

2646
01:51:58.361 --> 01:52:01.750
<v Speaker 2>success in a rapidly accelerated meaty market,</v>

2647
01:52:02.140 --> 01:52:03.370
<v Speaker 2>but they're not doing the real thing.</v>

2648
01:52:03.371 --> 01:52:03.491
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2649
01:52:03.491 --> 01:52:06.160
<v Speaker 2>basically dance Lou more complicated than that,</v>

2650
01:52:06.580 --> 01:52:07.413
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

2651
01:52:09.760 --> 01:52:13.570
<v Speaker 2>they're probably pursuing your goal that's higher than like covering at home in</v>

2652
01:52:13.571 --> 01:52:18.571
<v Speaker 2>your basement covered the cheeto dust [inaudible] suspicion for it.</v>

2653
01:52:20.270 --> 01:52:22.360
<v Speaker 2>It's still a sub optimal ethical pursuit.</v>

2654
01:52:22.900 --> 01:52:27.900
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

2655
01:52:36.400 --> 01:52:37.520
<v Speaker 2>as you can see,</v>

2656
01:52:37.560 --> 01:52:37.701
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2657
01:52:37.701 --> 01:52:39.360
<v Speaker 2>this might work doesn't sound like,</v>

2658
01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:42.071
<v Speaker 2>as you can see,</v>

2659
01:52:42.071 --> 01:52:44.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm President Donald J.</v>

2660
01:52:44.020 --> 01:52:46.400
<v Speaker 2>Trump or as you might not know,</v>

2661
01:52:46.401 --> 01:52:47.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm Trump fake epi.</v>

2662
01:52:48.260 --> 01:52:50.790
<v Speaker 2>So I was born in 1946 older than you.</v>

2663
01:52:51.140 --> 01:52:51.530
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2664
01:52:51.530 --> 01:52:52.790
<v Speaker 2>but you might be able to help.</v>

2665
01:52:53.150 --> 01:52:54.020
<v Speaker 2>In my quest,</v>

2666
01:52:54.050 --> 01:52:54.883
<v Speaker 2>in my book,</v>

2667
01:52:54.950 --> 01:52:55.940
<v Speaker 2>the art of the deal,</v>

2668
01:52:56.660 --> 01:53:00.050
<v Speaker 2>I talked about how I'm not just talking to him,</v>

2669
01:53:00.170 --> 01:53:04.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to bring people together from where they are.</v>

2670
01:53:04.850 --> 01:53:06.570
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like you've done that in your packets.</v>

2671
01:53:06.950 --> 01:53:08.190
<v Speaker 2>So here's our big challenge.</v>

2672
01:53:08.270 --> 01:53:09.170
<v Speaker 2>If you could help me with that,</v>

2673
01:53:09.350 --> 01:53:13.910
<v Speaker 2>how are we going to end the war between the sexes?</v>

2674
01:53:15.130 --> 01:53:19.460
<v Speaker 2>I have an idea how to start off because you did mention breastfeeding and one of</v>

2675
01:53:19.461 --> 01:53:22.470
<v Speaker 2>your speeches I saw in,</v>

2676
01:53:23.720 --> 01:53:25.940
<v Speaker 2>and right now that's an unpaid labor,</v>

2677
01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:31.960
<v Speaker 2>so [inaudible] paid to breastfeed for a start I think would be so angry at us,</v>

2678
01:53:41.091 --> 01:53:41.580
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2679
01:53:41.580 --> 01:53:46.580
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

2680
01:53:55.350 --> 01:53:56.183
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

2681
01:53:56.550 --> 01:54:00.460
<v Speaker 2>and that's for native to the sexual harassment question and that's what I've</v>

2682
01:54:00.470 --> 01:54:01.303
<v Speaker 2>seen in question.</v>

2683
01:54:01.320 --> 01:54:02.660
<v Speaker 2>Then it does.</v>

2684
01:54:03.260 --> 01:54:04.580
<v Speaker 2>Looking at all of this,</v>

2685
01:54:04.581 --> 01:54:05.414
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

2686
01:54:05.810 --> 01:54:06.021
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2687
01:54:06.021 --> 01:54:10.940
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to pull everyone's talents into the general marketplace,</v>

2688
01:54:10.970 --> 01:54:14.720
<v Speaker 2>let's say flux and there's some real utility in mountain.</v>

2689
01:54:14.960 --> 01:54:19.220
<v Speaker 2>It seems stupid to not use intelligence of half the population.</v>

2690
01:54:19.221 --> 01:54:22.810
<v Speaker 2>And I guess that's kind of what we decided with the invention of reliable on</v>

2691
01:54:22.820 --> 01:54:23.653
<v Speaker 2>birth control.</v>

2692
01:54:23.750 --> 01:54:27.290
<v Speaker 2>It was sort of a collective decision that if we could free women from the</v>

2693
01:54:27.291 --> 01:54:32.291
<v Speaker 2>inevitability of nonstop magic maternity,</v>

2694
01:54:33.620 --> 01:54:36.200
<v Speaker 2>that that might be a net benefit to everyone.</v>

2695
01:54:36.380 --> 01:54:38.600
<v Speaker 2>Now women is true.</v>

2696
01:54:38.601 --> 01:54:41.780
<v Speaker 2>We don't know because the experiments only me running for 40 years.</v>

2697
01:54:41.781 --> 01:54:42.830
<v Speaker 2>But you might think,</v>

2698
01:54:42.831 --> 01:54:47.831
<v Speaker 2>well it was an experiment with running and then the sexual revolution on that.</v>

2699
01:54:48.830 --> 01:54:50.270
<v Speaker 2>We're still in the throes of that.</v>

2700
01:54:50.300 --> 01:54:52.260
<v Speaker 2>Is it consequence as far as I'm concerned,</v>

2701
01:54:52.390 --> 01:54:55.120
<v Speaker 2>the introduction of the birth control pill because that's a biological</v>

2702
01:54:55.130 --> 01:54:55.963
<v Speaker 2>revolution of,</v>

2703
01:54:56.530 --> 01:54:56.741
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2704
01:54:56.741 --> 01:55:00.500
<v Speaker 2>I think the 20th century will be remembered for hydrogen bomb.</v>

2705
01:55:01.800 --> 01:55:03.800
<v Speaker 2>The microprocessor</v>

2706
01:55:05.300 --> 01:55:08.990
<v Speaker 2>and the birth control for those are the three big technological revolutions.</v>

2707
01:55:09.870 --> 01:55:10.401
<v Speaker 2>The question is,</v>

2708
01:55:10.401 --> 01:55:10.521
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2709
01:55:10.521 --> 01:55:13.670
<v Speaker 2>how should men and women act towards each other in the workplace?</v>

2710
01:55:13.671 --> 01:55:14.660
<v Speaker 2>And answer that as well.</v>

2711
01:55:14.661 --> 01:55:15.494
<v Speaker 2>We don't,</v>

2712
01:55:16.140 --> 01:55:16.973
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2713
01:55:17.250 --> 01:55:18.083
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2714
01:55:18.560 --> 01:55:19.393
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2715
01:55:19.880 --> 01:55:20.310
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2716
01:55:20.310 --> 01:55:23.060
<v Speaker 2>How to regulate our sexual behavior in the workplace.</v>

2717
01:55:23.550 --> 01:55:24.383
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2718
01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:25.580
<v Speaker 2>I think it has,</v>

2719
01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:27.441
<v Speaker 2>these are,</v>

2720
01:55:27.441 --> 01:55:29.450
<v Speaker 2>these are deeply ethical questions,</v>

2721
01:55:29.810 --> 01:55:32.350
<v Speaker 2>big ethical question of what were you doing when you go to the nightclub?</v>

2722
01:55:32.351 --> 01:55:32.631
<v Speaker 2>They think,</v>

2723
01:55:32.631 --> 01:55:34.130
<v Speaker 2>well that's not a deep ethical question.</v>

2724
01:55:34.131 --> 01:55:34.401
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2725
01:55:34.401 --> 01:55:34.821
<v Speaker 2>yeah and it's,</v>

2726
01:55:34.821 --> 01:55:37.930
<v Speaker 2>it's cause they get actually cause you're asking them,</v>

2727
01:55:37.931 --> 01:55:38.800
<v Speaker 2>well how should I repeat it?</v>

2728
01:55:38.810 --> 01:55:40.870
<v Speaker 2>My sexual behavior when I have choices matter.</v>

2729
01:55:41.490 --> 01:55:42.950
<v Speaker 2>And it's the same thing in the workplace.</v>

2730
01:55:43.290 --> 01:55:46.470
<v Speaker 2>You miss most in most situations like this.</v>

2731
01:55:46.471 --> 01:55:51.471
<v Speaker 2>I'm a traditionalist because I actually think that the best solution to the</v>

2732
01:55:51.961 --> 01:55:56.961
<v Speaker 2>problem about to the multiple problems that life throws at you is a stable</v>

2733
01:55:58.201 --> 01:55:59.034
<v Speaker 2>monogamy.</v>

2734
01:55:59.310 --> 01:56:00.450
<v Speaker 2>I think the evidence for that,</v>

2735
01:56:00.451 --> 01:56:02.130
<v Speaker 2>it's overwhelming now.</v>

2736
01:56:02.160 --> 01:56:04.050
<v Speaker 2>Exactly how you parameterize that.</v>

2737
01:56:05.020 --> 01:56:08.070
<v Speaker 2>What leeway you allow people within that framework.</v>

2738
01:56:08.280 --> 01:56:10.430
<v Speaker 2>Well enough wise enough to know.</v>

2739
01:56:11.370 --> 01:56:15.390
<v Speaker 2>I think you deviate from that path at your peril and that we deviate from that</v>

2740
01:56:15.391 --> 01:56:17.760
<v Speaker 2>path as a society apparel as well.</v>

2741
01:56:18.270 --> 01:56:19.103
<v Speaker 2>And so</v>

2742
01:56:21.390 --> 01:56:25.200
<v Speaker 2>I just would say if you're looking for a cheap thrill</v>

2743
01:56:26.700 --> 01:56:31.700
<v Speaker 2>and do you think that you could find that insects that you're sadly mistaken.</v>

2744
01:56:32.850 --> 01:56:34.080
<v Speaker 2>That's what it looks like to me.</v>

2745
01:56:34.770 --> 01:56:39.770
<v Speaker 2>And I think that if people were willing to accept that idea and I can certainly</v>

2746
01:56:40.201 --> 01:56:42.210
<v Speaker 2>understand why no one wants to</v>

2747
01:56:45.110 --> 01:56:46.190
<v Speaker 2>proceed in the workplace,</v>

2748
01:56:46.191 --> 01:56:51.191
<v Speaker 2>can start to tap themselves down quick about one of the things I tell my younger</v>

2749
01:56:51.871 --> 01:56:52.920
<v Speaker 2>clients in particular,</v>

2750
01:56:52.921 --> 01:56:56.910
<v Speaker 2>cause you know back in the 1950s I wasn't around him,</v>

2751
01:56:56.911 --> 01:56:59.040
<v Speaker 2>but let's say the 1960s,</v>

2752
01:56:59.540 --> 01:57:00.373
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2753
01:57:01.200 --> 01:57:04.350
<v Speaker 2>the default answer to the question,</v>

2754
01:57:04.990 --> 01:57:09.450
<v Speaker 2>will you sleep with animals and know and that's pretty good default.</v>

2755
01:57:09.750 --> 01:57:12.180
<v Speaker 2>And now it's not so obvious that that is the deep,</v>

2756
01:57:12.870 --> 01:57:14.160
<v Speaker 2>even though I think it shouldn't be.</v>

2757
01:57:14.580 --> 01:57:15.780
<v Speaker 2>But here's a rule of thumb.</v>

2758
01:57:16.140 --> 01:57:17.280
<v Speaker 2>Is it useful one,</v>

2759
01:57:17.281 --> 01:57:19.230
<v Speaker 2>when you're trying to figure out how the events,</v>

2760
01:57:19.231 --> 01:57:22.770
<v Speaker 2>your sexual interaction with frozen new relationship,</v>

2761
01:57:23.310 --> 01:57:26.730
<v Speaker 2>how about you don't do anything physically with anyone that you wouldn't talk to</v>

2762
01:57:26.731 --> 01:57:28.130
<v Speaker 2>them about it first.</v>

2763
01:57:29.010 --> 01:57:31.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean active consent.</v>

2764
01:57:31.530 --> 01:57:36.530
<v Speaker 2>I think that whole idea is a fabrication of delusional 13 year old girl</v>

2765
01:57:38.310 --> 01:57:43.310
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] because Mike is a lot more stuff.</v>

2766
01:57:47.340 --> 01:57:52.340
<v Speaker 2>But I do think that a good rule because something like no physical intimacy or</v>

2767
01:57:52.950 --> 01:57:54.750
<v Speaker 2>the corresponding emotional intimacy.</v>

2768
01:57:55.110 --> 01:57:57.520
<v Speaker 2>And I think the reason for that is because you just can't traction.</v>

2769
01:57:58.170 --> 01:58:00.610
<v Speaker 2>If I could come as a package and I,</v>

2770
01:58:00.611 --> 01:58:04.280
<v Speaker 2>I think that you've been fractionated off your functions,</v>

2771
01:58:04.590 --> 01:58:07.830
<v Speaker 2>let's say at your psychological peril.</v>

2772
01:58:08.730 --> 01:58:09.563
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

2773
01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:13.980
<v Speaker 2>now that's a pretty vague answer,</v>

2774
01:58:14.020 --> 01:58:14.853
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately,</v>

2775
01:58:16.100 --> 01:58:17.430
<v Speaker 2>all encompassing question,</v>

2776
01:58:17.431 --> 01:58:17.641
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2777
01:58:17.641 --> 01:58:20.320
<v Speaker 2>So you're going to get a vague answer to an all encompassing question.</v>

2778
01:58:22.410 --> 01:58:25.680
<v Speaker 2>I also wrote a little bit about that at the end of the 12 rules for life.</v>

2779
01:58:25.681 --> 01:58:27.110
<v Speaker 2>When I'm talking about the architect,</v>

2780
01:58:28.250 --> 01:58:29.850
<v Speaker 2>the architectural know,</v>

2781
01:58:30.270 --> 01:58:34.410
<v Speaker 2>the architectural representations of human beings in the Christian domain,</v>

2782
01:58:34.770 --> 01:58:39.180
<v Speaker 2>the archetypal representation of a woman is a virgin with the chocolate and the</v>

2783
01:58:39.190 --> 01:58:40.800
<v Speaker 2>archetypal representation of a man.</v>

2784
01:58:40.801 --> 01:58:42.070
<v Speaker 2>It's a crucified heal.</v>

2785
01:58:42.880 --> 01:58:44.960
<v Speaker 2>And those are all some pretty decent representation.</v>

2786
01:58:45.150 --> 01:58:46.120
<v Speaker 2>They're overwhelming,</v>

2787
01:58:46.210 --> 01:58:46.930
<v Speaker 2>powerful,</v>

2788
01:58:46.930 --> 01:58:50.740
<v Speaker 2>you know that because they wouldn't last several thousand years.</v>

2789
01:58:50.750 --> 01:58:51.500
<v Speaker 2>The code heavy wonder,</v>

2790
01:58:51.500 --> 01:58:56.500
<v Speaker 2>well how well globally the crucifixion image is an image of the voluntary except</v>

2791
01:58:57.851 --> 01:59:01.420
<v Speaker 2>as the suffering and death and the possibility that's transcendent and the</v>

2792
01:59:01.421 --> 01:59:03.450
<v Speaker 2>virgin mother is something like that.</v>

2793
01:59:04.060 --> 01:59:09.060
<v Speaker 2>The pristine totality of the feminine and the and the and the feminine in</v>

2794
01:59:10.421 --> 01:59:11.590
<v Speaker 2>conjunction with the infant.</v>

2795
01:59:11.980 --> 01:59:13.330
<v Speaker 2>And those are holding images.</v>

2796
01:59:13.331 --> 01:59:17.050
<v Speaker 2>And then I would say that if you're not treating each other like you're a</v>

2797
01:59:17.051 --> 01:59:19.150
<v Speaker 2>manifestation of that whole the image,</v>

2798
01:59:19.151 --> 01:59:21.910
<v Speaker 2>then you're not treating each other property might say,</v>

2799
01:59:21.911 --> 01:59:22.900
<v Speaker 2>well that's a pretty high,</v>

2800
01:59:23.940 --> 01:59:24.773
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2801
01:59:27.260 --> 01:59:29.760
<v Speaker 2>that's an extreme demands.</v>

2802
01:59:29.770 --> 01:59:30.700
<v Speaker 2>Like well that's okay.</v>

2803
01:59:30.790 --> 01:59:31.850
<v Speaker 2>Life makes experience.</v>

2804
01:59:32.650 --> 01:59:34.410
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing about 20 extremes of</v>

2805
01:59:36.190 --> 01:59:40.540
<v Speaker 2>the reason that those are images exist is because they reflect a reality that</v>

2806
01:59:40.541 --> 01:59:41.680
<v Speaker 2>can't be transcendent,</v>

2807
01:59:42.130 --> 01:59:43.000
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

2808
01:59:43.001 --> 01:59:45.070
<v Speaker 2>And so you violate them at your peril.</v>

2809
01:59:46.810 --> 01:59:47.643
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

2810
01:59:49.780 --> 01:59:51.060
<v Speaker 2>it's a little rough that</v>

2811
01:59:52.660 --> 01:59:53.493
<v Speaker 2>have to do,</v>

2812
01:59:55.380 --> 01:59:56.320
<v Speaker 2>here's some big band.</v>

2813
01:59:57.250 --> 01:59:59.580
<v Speaker 2>I am doing research on plasticity.</v>

2814
02:00:00.880 --> 02:00:02.290
<v Speaker 2>I read normally</v>

2815
02:00:04.240 --> 02:00:09.240
<v Speaker 2>if you're forward vocals and I was just wondering why your costs,</v>

2816
02:00:10.600 --> 02:00:13.030
<v Speaker 2>the CV search as it got me the streaming engine,</v>

2817
02:00:13.050 --> 02:00:14.920
<v Speaker 2>that sense of</v>

2818
02:00:16.910 --> 02:00:18.800
<v Speaker 2>psychologists boxes.</v>

2819
02:00:20.810 --> 02:00:21.643
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2820
02:00:22.060 --> 02:00:27.060
<v Speaker 2>well I think that it is talked about but I would say it's talked about more on</v>

2821
02:00:27.071 --> 02:00:28.650
<v Speaker 2>the biological end of the spectrum,</v>

2822
02:00:28.660 --> 02:00:30.870
<v Speaker 2>like convinced studies of neuroplasticity,</v>

2823
02:00:30.940 --> 02:00:31.620
<v Speaker 2>especially at the,</v>

2824
02:00:31.620 --> 02:00:33.820
<v Speaker 2>the capital level for a very long period of time.</v>

2825
02:00:34.270 --> 02:00:38.080
<v Speaker 2>But then I would also say probably because it's more of a medical concern that</v>

2826
02:00:38.081 --> 02:00:39.990
<v Speaker 2>it is a psychology concerns specifically.</v>

2827
02:00:40.900 --> 02:00:42.500
<v Speaker 2>So that was about,</v>

2828
02:00:44.200 --> 02:00:45.920
<v Speaker 2>it's also very complicated field,</v>

2829
02:00:48.750 --> 02:00:51.850
<v Speaker 2>but it's more psychologists.</v>

2830
02:00:52.990 --> 02:00:54.580
<v Speaker 2>Unless you go to a clinical school,</v>

2831
02:00:54.970 --> 02:00:58.300
<v Speaker 2>most of the psychology you take is direct from the experimental realm.</v>

2832
02:00:58.420 --> 02:01:01.180
<v Speaker 2>So it's not concerned with medical issues to such a great degree.</v>

2833
02:01:02.710 --> 02:01:04.420
<v Speaker 2>There is plenty of study done on,</v>

2834
02:01:04.770 --> 02:01:08.950
<v Speaker 2>on neuro transformations that occur as a consequence of learning.</v>

2835
02:01:09.470 --> 02:01:10.150
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2836
02:01:10.150 --> 02:01:15.150
<v Speaker 2>but not so much with regards to neural plasticity as a treatment that just or</v>

2837
02:01:15.640 --> 02:01:17.890
<v Speaker 2>exploitation of neuroplasticity as a treatment,</v>

2838
02:01:17.891 --> 02:01:20.040
<v Speaker 2>which is what Norman was concentrating on.</v>

2839
02:01:20.890 --> 02:01:24.730
<v Speaker 2>So I think it is more at a micro level among psychologist,</v>

2840
02:01:24.731 --> 02:01:25.321
<v Speaker 2>but it's very,</v>

2841
02:01:25.321 --> 02:01:29.830
<v Speaker 2>you just have to look into more of the physiological end of the literature</v>

2842
02:01:29.860 --> 02:01:32.220
<v Speaker 2>rather than straight forward.</v>

2843
02:01:32.260 --> 02:01:33.093
<v Speaker 2>Second logical,</v>

2844
02:01:39.440 --> 02:01:40.880
<v Speaker 2>this isn't much of a question.</v>

2845
02:01:41.030 --> 02:01:41.863
<v Speaker 2>More of a thank you.</v>

2846
02:01:41.950 --> 02:01:42.230
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2847
02:01:42.230 --> 02:01:46.380
<v Speaker 2>two weeks ago I wouldn't be able changing when I walked in the Nasdaq and 25 to</v>

2848
02:01:46.381 --> 02:01:47.070
<v Speaker 2>your diverse,</v>

2849
02:01:47.070 --> 02:01:50.440
<v Speaker 2>we're sitting around and watching the electric line equity base politics and</v>

2850
02:01:50.730 --> 02:01:52.100
<v Speaker 2>what we're facing right now.</v>

2851
02:01:52.350 --> 02:01:53.390
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2852
02:01:54.710 --> 02:01:56.390
<v Speaker 2>and additionally,</v>

2853
02:01:57.530 --> 02:01:58.820
<v Speaker 2>first by from unit,</v>

2854
02:01:59.000 --> 02:01:59.540
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2855
02:01:59.540 --> 02:02:04.540
<v Speaker 2>your explanation archetypes and most amount of stress disorder for a number of</v>

2856
02:02:04.640 --> 02:02:05.210
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2857
02:02:05.210 --> 02:02:06.043
<v Speaker 2>You're not from.</v>

2858
02:02:06.690 --> 02:02:08.070
<v Speaker 2>I just like the Pantry for that.</v>

2859
02:02:08.180 --> 02:02:10.250
<v Speaker 2>If then you a small token to clarify.</v>

2860
02:02:11.670 --> 02:02:12.210
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

2861
02:02:12.210 --> 02:02:17.210
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2862
02:02:28.810 --> 02:02:31.440
<v Speaker 2>I want to make a comment about that because one of the things that's happened</v>

2863
02:02:31.500 --> 02:02:32.430
<v Speaker 2>very frequently</v>

2864
02:02:34.110 --> 02:02:36.390
<v Speaker 2>over the last 18 months or so has been,</v>

2865
02:02:36.480 --> 02:02:37.410
<v Speaker 2>I've had letters</v>

2866
02:02:39.330 --> 02:02:44.330
<v Speaker 2>members come up to me during my talks and said that they'd be suffering from</v>

2867
02:02:44.971 --> 02:02:49.971
<v Speaker 2>post traumatic stress disorder and listening to my lectures on health and you</v>

2868
02:02:52.460 --> 02:02:52.621
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

2869
02:02:52.621 --> 02:02:53.570
<v Speaker 2>what's the right thing here?</v>

2870
02:02:53.610 --> 02:02:55.140
<v Speaker 2>Because supposed to be an express disorders.</v>

2871
02:02:55.500 --> 02:02:56.333
<v Speaker 2>That's</v>

2872
02:02:59.040 --> 02:03:01.860
<v Speaker 2>horrible condition and you know,</v>

2873
02:03:01.920 --> 02:03:06.720
<v Speaker 2>it's so interesting because I treated a number of people stress disorder who</v>

2874
02:03:06.721 --> 02:03:08.790
<v Speaker 2>aren't military people can find where it doesn't.</v>

2875
02:03:08.910 --> 02:03:12.600
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't really matter in some sense of what I had gathered from now.</v>

2876
02:03:12.640 --> 02:03:12.970
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

2877
02:03:12.970 --> 02:03:16.350
<v Speaker 2>but from reading you on as well was that people need to,</v>

2878
02:03:16.740 --> 02:03:19.290
<v Speaker 2>if something terrible has happened to you,</v>

2879
02:03:19.920 --> 02:03:21.240
<v Speaker 2>it's more than just trap.</v>

2880
02:03:21.510 --> 02:03:22.201
<v Speaker 2>That's on Fab,</v>

2881
02:03:22.201 --> 02:03:23.530
<v Speaker 2>not crunching travel fees,</v>

2882
02:03:23.531 --> 02:03:25.620
<v Speaker 2>backtrack traffic weeks when your mother dies of cancer.</v>

2883
02:03:25.621 --> 02:03:26.550
<v Speaker 2>That's a terrible thing.</v>

2884
02:03:28.740 --> 02:03:33.740
<v Speaker 2>Malevolence is when someone destroys your life on purpose or destroy someone</v>

2885
02:03:33.961 --> 02:03:34.571
<v Speaker 2>else's life.</v>

2886
02:03:34.571 --> 02:03:39.460
<v Speaker 2>That brings pain movies necessarily with all sorts of circumstances where the</v>

2887
02:03:39.530 --> 02:03:44.490
<v Speaker 2>spring forward not really hurts people and if you have post traumatic stress</v>

2888
02:03:44.491 --> 02:03:45.030
<v Speaker 2>disorder,</v>

2889
02:03:45.030 --> 02:03:46.020
<v Speaker 2>as far as I can tell,</v>

2890
02:03:46.021 --> 02:03:48.750
<v Speaker 2>the only thing that can bring you back,</v>

2891
02:03:48.790 --> 02:03:53.430
<v Speaker 2>it's to develop a religious level philosophy of avid between good and evil.</v>

2892
02:03:54.120 --> 02:03:58.260
<v Speaker 2>I've seen anything I've ever seen because first of all if you listen to someone</v>

2893
02:03:58.261 --> 02:03:59.880
<v Speaker 2>who have post traumatic stress disorder,</v>

2894
02:04:00.210 --> 02:04:01.120
<v Speaker 2>I gotta I declined.</v>

2895
02:04:01.400 --> 02:04:05.010
<v Speaker 2>I talk about her a little bit in this book though I tried to disguise your</v>

2896
02:04:05.011 --> 02:04:10.011
<v Speaker 2>identity who was frightened into three years of four hour long Gayley</v>

2897
02:04:10.331 --> 02:04:12.910
<v Speaker 2>concussions by will invoke on her boyfriends.</v>

2898
02:04:14.280 --> 02:04:15.360
<v Speaker 2>That actually happened now.</v>

2899
02:04:15.361 --> 02:04:20.361
<v Speaker 2>She was a very naive person who thanks to the parents and she saw a look that</v>

2900
02:04:21.781 --> 02:04:22.110
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2901
02:04:22.110 --> 02:04:24.850
<v Speaker 2>I am going to do everything I possibly can to her.</v>

2902
02:04:25.650 --> 02:04:30.360
<v Speaker 2>And she didn't believe that such a low awesome being very naive and that was</v>

2903
02:04:30.361 --> 02:04:31.194
<v Speaker 2>enough to,</v>

2904
02:04:32.790 --> 02:04:33.300
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2905
02:04:33.300 --> 02:04:36.810
<v Speaker 2>when she first came to be the last diagnosis she had with,</v>

2906
02:04:38.230 --> 02:04:43.230
<v Speaker 2>that's what all about you fragment and we worked through that in about a year,</v>

2907
02:04:44.120 --> 02:04:47.850
<v Speaker 2>about a year and she was a lot less naive by the end of that year.</v>

2908
02:04:47.980 --> 02:04:48.813
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>

2909
02:04:49.060 --> 02:04:49.893
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2910
02:04:51.310 --> 02:04:52.290
<v Speaker 2>but that was,</v>

2911
02:04:52.590 --> 02:04:54.300
<v Speaker 2>that's been so striking to me because</v>

2912
02:04:56.910 --> 02:04:57.181
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2913
02:04:57.181 --> 02:05:00.120
<v Speaker 2>when you're treating someone with a very serious psychiatric condition,</v>

2914
02:05:01.620 --> 02:05:04.710
<v Speaker 2>they'd be exposed to something brutally terrible.</v>

2915
02:05:06.470 --> 02:05:10.890
<v Speaker 2>That there's a philosophical cure for that or get a theological pure in some</v>

2916
02:05:10.891 --> 02:05:12.540
<v Speaker 2>sense of whatever.</v>

2917
02:05:13.100 --> 02:05:14.010
<v Speaker 2>It's really remarkable.</v>

2918
02:05:14.070 --> 02:05:15.180
<v Speaker 2>That can be the case.</v>

2919
02:05:15.870 --> 02:05:20.460
<v Speaker 2>But just for people to know that that evil does exist in the world is a great</v>

2920
02:05:20.461 --> 02:05:24.090
<v Speaker 2>relief in front of buy it and have no language to describe it.</v>

2921
02:05:24.660 --> 02:05:24.941
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2922
02:05:24.941 --> 02:05:29.250
<v Speaker 2>I believe people exist exists and you this and you real.</v>

2923
02:05:29.550 --> 02:05:30.750
<v Speaker 2>It's really real.</v>

2924
02:05:30.960 --> 02:05:32.490
<v Speaker 2>It's more real than anything else.</v>

2925
02:05:32.730 --> 02:05:35.490
<v Speaker 2>Almost except maybe then good.</v>

2926
02:05:36.180 --> 02:05:37.950
<v Speaker 2>And it's a relief to people to know that,</v>

2927
02:05:38.850 --> 02:05:42.030
<v Speaker 2>to know that that's actually the case because then it takes them out with their</v>

2928
02:05:42.031 --> 02:05:43.020
<v Speaker 2>terrible isolation.</v>

2929
02:05:44.070 --> 02:05:46.890
<v Speaker 2>What's the vacuum and the common realm of humanity,</v>

2930
02:05:47.720 --> 02:05:47.881
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2931
02:05:47.881 --> 02:05:48.631
<v Speaker 2>And also to say,</v>

2932
02:05:48.631 --> 02:05:52.980
<v Speaker 2>well Tony does evil exist but it exists in you and in each of us.</v>

2933
02:05:53.040 --> 02:05:57.750
<v Speaker 2>And the mere fact that it manifested itself does not necessarily mean that</v>

2934
02:05:57.751 --> 02:05:59.370
<v Speaker 2>you're damned for all time,</v>

2935
02:05:59.610 --> 02:06:01.890
<v Speaker 2>which is really how you feel if you have post traumatic stress.</v>

2936
02:06:04.100 --> 02:06:08.080
<v Speaker 2>So that's been extremely interested in him and also great.</v>

2937
02:06:08.190 --> 02:06:12.930
<v Speaker 2>It's wonderful thing to have people being hurt so badly and we can't find any</v>

2938
02:06:13.230 --> 02:06:14.063
<v Speaker 2>respite.</v>

2939
02:06:14.280 --> 02:06:14.850
<v Speaker 2>How would you say?</v>

2940
02:06:14.850 --> 02:06:18.870
<v Speaker 2>Well I listen to lectures about versus tragic,</v>

2941
02:06:19.560 --> 02:06:24.540
<v Speaker 2>which are key lecture problem that it's to help put you back together.</v>

2942
02:06:24.930 --> 02:06:26.970
<v Speaker 2>So that's good news man.</v>

2943
02:06:27.750 --> 02:06:28.583
<v Speaker 2>Thank you very much.</v>

2944
02:06:29.470 --> 02:06:30.660
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

2945
02:06:32.760 --> 02:06:36.590
<v Speaker 2>thank you for joining us again in May cover and I just want to thank you.</v>

2946
02:06:38.810 --> 02:06:39.730
<v Speaker 2>I'll get to my question.</v>

2947
02:06:40.580 --> 02:06:45.090
<v Speaker 2>You had an interview recently with a place to place news and there was like</v>

2948
02:06:52.610 --> 02:06:57.610
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] [inaudible] the sort of reaction that people haven't seen this,</v>

2949
02:06:59.791 --> 02:07:04.791
<v Speaker 2>but the reaction to the people who did get or sort of some combination of anger</v>

2950
02:07:05.071 --> 02:07:07.890
<v Speaker 2>and confusion at that little excerpt that they were meeting.</v>

2951
02:07:08.180 --> 02:07:08.820
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2952
02:07:08.820 --> 02:07:13.350
<v Speaker 2>and you were talking about what sort of rules like Hubbard men and women working</v>

2953
02:07:13.351 --> 02:07:15.740
<v Speaker 2>together in the workplace and the number of related division.</v>

2954
02:07:15.960 --> 02:07:18.480
<v Speaker 2>Cause I wanted to ask you about that interview,</v>

2955
02:07:18.710 --> 02:07:18.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2956
02:07:18.870 --> 02:07:20.220
<v Speaker 2>what happened in that interview,</v>

2957
02:07:20.221 --> 02:07:24.030
<v Speaker 2>in what happened in that exchange and maybe give some context to,</v>

2958
02:07:24.380 --> 02:07:25.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2959
02:07:25.080 --> 02:07:27.130
<v Speaker 2>what was going on in that particular exchange that,</v>

2960
02:07:28.350 --> 02:07:28.670
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2961
02:07:28.670 --> 02:07:32.820
<v Speaker 2>I think what happened in the interview is what's happening as the traditional</v>

2962
02:07:32.850 --> 02:07:33.850
<v Speaker 2>media folds,</v>

2963
02:07:33.880 --> 02:07:35.220
<v Speaker 2>boobies and parish,</v>

2964
02:07:35.740 --> 02:07:39.310
<v Speaker 2>which is happening to the extraordinary community newspapers.</v>

2965
02:07:39.311 --> 02:07:42.610
<v Speaker 2>And you go on cabinet government for their subsequent,</v>

2966
02:07:42.611 --> 02:07:42.851
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2967
02:07:42.851 --> 02:07:46.120
<v Speaker 2>that CDC and 145,000 youtube subscribers.</v>

2968
02:07:46.540 --> 02:07:48.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember what their budget is,</v>

2969
02:07:48.691 --> 02:07:49.360
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

2970
02:07:49.360 --> 02:07:50.193
<v Speaker 2>it's in there,</v>

2971
02:07:50.500 --> 02:07:51.760
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly,</v>

2972
02:07:51.761 --> 02:07:52.750
<v Speaker 2>it's $1 billion,</v>

2973
02:07:52.751 --> 02:07:53.890
<v Speaker 2>but that might be wrong,</v>

2974
02:07:54.040 --> 02:07:54.873
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't matter.</v>

2975
02:07:55.110 --> 02:07:56.110
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot.</v>

2976
02:07:56.350 --> 02:08:00.400
<v Speaker 2>And all the finish degenerate on youtube does under 45,000 subscribers.</v>

2977
02:08:00.401 --> 02:08:00.700
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2978
02:08:00.700 --> 02:08:05.500
<v Speaker 2>which is absolute abject 100% catastrophic failures.</v>

2979
02:08:07.750 --> 02:08:09.580
<v Speaker 2>I think that there's a bunch of reasons for that.</v>

2980
02:08:09.610 --> 02:08:12.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean one of them is that there is a technological transformation of current,</v>

2981
02:08:13.390 --> 02:08:13.631
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2982
02:08:13.631 --> 02:08:18.631
<v Speaker 2>Because one of the things about youtube offers everything that TV offers and a</v>

2983
02:08:18.941 --> 02:08:20.200
<v Speaker 2>bunch of things it doesn't offer,</v>

2984
02:08:20.320 --> 02:08:21.430
<v Speaker 2>so it's going to win.</v>

2985
02:08:21.880 --> 02:08:24.460
<v Speaker 2>It's clearly winning already and so,</v>

2986
02:08:25.080 --> 02:08:28.930
<v Speaker 2>and then I think that what's happening as the classic broadcast media starts to</v>

2987
02:08:28.931 --> 02:08:30.160
<v Speaker 2>spiral has been good.</v>

2988
02:08:30.161 --> 02:08:31.090
<v Speaker 2>People start to leave.</v>

2989
02:08:31.091 --> 02:08:32.470
<v Speaker 2>It's a premium distribution issue.</v>

2990
02:08:32.710 --> 02:08:36.790
<v Speaker 2>They're good people start to leave because they can and then those that remain</v>

2991
02:08:36.791 --> 02:08:41.530
<v Speaker 2>are less competent and they get more desperate and they broadcast more and more</v>

2992
02:08:41.531 --> 02:08:46.531
<v Speaker 2>opinionated and Polaroids pieces to attract the remaining audience as they</v>

2993
02:08:47.351 --> 02:08:49.330
<v Speaker 2>spiral towards zero</v>

2994
02:08:51.490 --> 02:08:54.790
<v Speaker 2>is how companies like I know how it works.</v>

2995
02:08:55.330 --> 02:08:56.200
<v Speaker 2>That's how it works.</v>

2996
02:08:56.201 --> 02:09:00.620
<v Speaker 2>And so I think the vice interview as part of that and the injured,</v>

2997
02:09:00.680 --> 02:09:00.990
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

2998
02:09:00.990 --> 02:09:02.680
<v Speaker 2>there's other things that are feeding into that.</v>

2999
02:09:02.680 --> 02:09:03.513
<v Speaker 2>But I think,</v>

3000
02:09:03.850 --> 02:09:06.740
<v Speaker 2>and maybe this is also a consequence of the broadcast medium,</v>

3001
02:09:06.760 --> 02:09:11.170
<v Speaker 2>is that because broadcast television had a very narrow time,</v>

3002
02:09:11.500 --> 02:09:12.790
<v Speaker 2>heavy crown contracts,</v>

3003
02:09:12.791 --> 02:09:14.830
<v Speaker 2>things in the small periods of time too.</v>

3004
02:09:14.831 --> 02:09:19.831
<v Speaker 2>It was very pronounced tendency for journalists to do all the interpretation and</v>

3005
02:09:20.081 --> 02:09:23.770
<v Speaker 2>then that turned into a pronounced tendency for journalists to describe what</v>

3006
02:09:23.771 --> 02:09:25.750
<v Speaker 2>they thought and what the news was.</v>

3007
02:09:26.020 --> 02:09:26.261
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

3008
02:09:26.261 --> 02:09:29.430
<v Speaker 2>so that they were now the the news rubbers,</v>

3009
02:09:29.640 --> 02:09:31.980
<v Speaker 2>I started noticing this about 25 years ago with,</v>

3010
02:09:32.390 --> 02:09:33.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3011
02:09:33.190 --> 02:09:35.290
<v Speaker 2>the news would show a politician talking,</v>

3012
02:09:36.460 --> 02:09:39.300
<v Speaker 2>but the newscaster would be saying what the person said.</v>

3013
02:09:39.310 --> 02:09:40.143
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3014
02:09:40.480 --> 02:09:40.661
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3015
02:09:40.661 --> 02:09:44.800
<v Speaker 2>why have the volume missionary at all humans have the newscast?</v>

3016
02:09:45.370 --> 02:09:49.630
<v Speaker 2>And that's when I stopped watching television news and that was reading about 25</v>

3017
02:09:49.631 --> 02:09:50.464
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

3018
02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:52.030
<v Speaker 2>The vice interview was,</v>

3019
02:09:52.270 --> 02:09:54.220
<v Speaker 2>was that sort of taken to its extreme?</v>

3020
02:09:54.270 --> 02:09:55.810
<v Speaker 2>It's like he had enough,</v>

3021
02:09:56.530 --> 02:10:01.300
<v Speaker 2>he had an idea of what the situation was and he was doing,</v>

3022
02:10:01.780 --> 02:10:04.800
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't as aggressive about it as Kathy Newman.</v>

3023
02:10:06.410 --> 02:10:08.350
<v Speaker 2>It was the same sort of thing.</v>

3024
02:10:08.390 --> 02:10:13.260
<v Speaker 2>It's like he was not cashed me out one way or another and not have it for about</v>

3025
02:10:13.261 --> 02:10:13.751
<v Speaker 2>two hours.</v>

3026
02:10:13.751 --> 02:10:16.340
<v Speaker 2>And he had kind of a supercilious attitude,</v>

3027
02:10:16.980 --> 02:10:17.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3028
02:10:17.770 --> 02:10:21.750
<v Speaker 2>which is not uncommon among let's say New York journalists and you don't,</v>

3029
02:10:22.090 --> 02:10:27.090
<v Speaker 2>and we talked for about two hours and I said something that was provocative.</v>

3030
02:10:28.511 --> 02:10:31.240
<v Speaker 2>I would say that I said,</v>

3031
02:10:31.241 --> 02:10:31.391
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3032
02:10:31.391 --> 02:10:34.460
<v Speaker 2>we don't know what the rules governing men and women's behavior,</v>

3033
02:10:34.520 --> 02:10:36.800
<v Speaker 2>sexual behavior in the workplace should be.</v>

3034
02:10:36.801 --> 02:10:37.071
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

3035
02:10:37.071 --> 02:10:37.221
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3036
02:10:37.221 --> 02:10:39.410
<v Speaker 2>let's take makeup high heels for examples.</v>

3037
02:10:39.411 --> 02:10:41.270
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe they shouldn't be allowed.</v>

3038
02:10:41.690 --> 02:10:44.000
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say they shouldn't be allowed.</v>

3039
02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:45.200
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

3040
02:10:45.200 --> 02:10:46.330
<v Speaker 2>maybe they shouldn't be allowed.</v>

3041
02:10:46.580 --> 02:10:49.350
<v Speaker 2>That was actually what you do when you try to think about something.</v>

3042
02:10:49.490 --> 02:10:54.490
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

3043
02:10:55.130 --> 02:10:56.090
<v Speaker 2>my clinical practice.</v>

3044
02:10:56.100 --> 02:10:59.150
<v Speaker 2>So let's say I'm dealing with someone and I say,</v>

3045
02:10:59.151 --> 02:10:59.271
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3046
02:10:59.271 --> 02:11:03.020
<v Speaker 2>let's think of some options for your future and for their reading.</v>

3047
02:11:03.021 --> 02:11:04.370
<v Speaker 2>Nervous like right away it's like,</v>

3048
02:11:04.371 --> 02:11:04.581
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3049
02:11:04.581 --> 02:11:05.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do that.</v>

3050
02:11:05.510 --> 02:11:05.800
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3051
02:11:05.800 --> 02:11:06.890
<v Speaker 2>well relax.</v>

3052
02:11:07.670 --> 02:11:09.440
<v Speaker 2>We can talk about a bunch of things.</v>

3053
02:11:09.670 --> 02:11:14.670
<v Speaker 2>And that doesn't mean they have to have these life is like</v>

3054
02:11:17.390 --> 02:11:20.270
<v Speaker 2>for people to make out when you get all nervous.</v>

3055
02:11:20.271 --> 02:11:20.561
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

3056
02:11:20.561 --> 02:11:22.580
<v Speaker 2>well I'd want to talk about with that.</v>

3057
02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.280
<v Speaker 2>We're not really make a rule.</v>

3058
02:11:25.370 --> 02:11:27.050
<v Speaker 2>We're going to talk about 10 things to make.</v>

3059
02:11:27.051 --> 02:11:29.190
<v Speaker 2>It might happen and none of them are going to help.</v>

3060
02:11:30.570 --> 02:11:32.240
<v Speaker 2>People can finally have a bit of courage.</v>

3061
02:11:32.241 --> 02:11:36.620
<v Speaker 2>And maybe what we'll do when you think is you throw out an idea and you think</v>

3062
02:11:36.621 --> 02:11:37.460
<v Speaker 2>about going to talk.</v>

3063
02:11:37.461 --> 02:11:40.250
<v Speaker 2>Well you know it's been common practice.</v>

3064
02:11:40.280 --> 02:11:41.930
<v Speaker 2>Men wear uniforms at work,</v>

3065
02:11:43.080 --> 02:11:43.970
<v Speaker 2>wear suits,</v>

3066
02:11:44.220 --> 02:11:46.340
<v Speaker 2>the suits a derivation of a military uniform.</v>

3067
02:11:46.670 --> 02:11:48.020
<v Speaker 2>Why did men wear suits?</v>

3068
02:11:48.290 --> 02:11:50.450
<v Speaker 2>So they're all the same.</v>

3069
02:11:50.930 --> 02:11:52.490
<v Speaker 2>Why should they all be all the same?</v>

3070
02:11:52.790 --> 02:11:57.790
<v Speaker 2>So that unnecessary individual variability doesn't interfere with the</v>

3071
02:11:57.981 --> 02:11:59.810
<v Speaker 2>functionality of the business.</v>

3072
02:11:59.930 --> 02:12:01.190
<v Speaker 2>Now you can argue about that.</v>

3073
02:12:01.191 --> 02:12:01.641
<v Speaker 2>You might say,</v>

3074
02:12:01.641 --> 02:12:05.380
<v Speaker 2>well he didn't want to make everyone wear the same damn soon cause you get</v>

3075
02:12:05.470 --> 02:12:07.790
<v Speaker 2>involved with creativity and fair enough,</v>

3076
02:12:07.791 --> 02:12:08.840
<v Speaker 2>that's a reasonable argument.</v>

3077
02:12:08.841 --> 02:12:10.820
<v Speaker 2>But that's why the uniform,</v>

3078
02:12:10.821 --> 02:12:11.990
<v Speaker 2>the suit evolve.</v>

3079
02:12:12.230 --> 02:12:15.530
<v Speaker 2>And so if you wear a suit and I wear a suit and go to a business meeting and the</v>

3080
02:12:15.531 --> 02:12:17.150
<v Speaker 2>first thing we can figure out as well,</v>

3081
02:12:17.270 --> 02:12:19.460
<v Speaker 2>you're at least playing the same game.</v>

3082
02:12:19.461 --> 02:12:20.390
<v Speaker 2>I am enough.</v>

3083
02:12:20.391 --> 02:12:24.080
<v Speaker 2>So that you're wearing a suit and it's like that's not everything,</v>

3084
02:12:24.081 --> 02:12:25.190
<v Speaker 2>but it's not nothing.</v>

3085
02:12:25.400 --> 02:12:26.090
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3086
02:12:26.090 --> 02:12:26.923
<v Speaker 2>And so well,</v>

3087
02:12:26.990 --> 02:12:28.300
<v Speaker 2>and then when the mine was,</v>

3088
02:12:28.400 --> 02:12:28.671
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3089
02:12:28.671 --> 02:12:31.370
<v Speaker 2>with the mouth made their advances in China,</v>

3090
02:12:32.090 --> 02:12:34.010
<v Speaker 2>men and women wore the same uniform.</v>

3091
02:12:34.150 --> 02:12:34.983
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

3092
02:12:35.050 --> 02:12:35.171
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3093
02:12:35.171 --> 02:12:36.240
<v Speaker 2>it was for the same reason.</v>

3094
02:12:36.241 --> 02:12:39.200
<v Speaker 2>That was to eliminate unnecessary individual variability.</v>

3095
02:12:39.650 --> 02:12:40.460
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3096
02:12:40.460 --> 02:12:42.530
<v Speaker 2>if you don't want sexual behavior at work,</v>

3097
02:12:43.280 --> 02:12:43.701
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

3098
02:12:43.701 --> 02:12:44.610
<v Speaker 2>you've got to decide that.</v>

3099
02:12:44.960 --> 02:12:47.780
<v Speaker 2>Do you not want sexual behavior at work?</v>

3100
02:12:47.990 --> 02:12:49.850
<v Speaker 2>Cause the answer to that might not be,</v>

3101
02:12:50.060 --> 02:12:52.070
<v Speaker 2>we don't want sexual behavior at work.</v>

3102
02:12:52.310 --> 02:12:52.891
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to live?</v>

3103
02:12:52.891 --> 02:12:55.940
<v Speaker 2>If you want to work in an environment where romantic entanglements are</v>

3104
02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:56.990
<v Speaker 2>essentially illegal,</v>

3105
02:12:57.680 --> 02:12:59.030
<v Speaker 2>that's what NBC has done,</v>

3106
02:12:59.660 --> 02:12:59.991
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3107
02:12:59.991 --> 02:13:02.420
<v Speaker 2>That's their new policy is like if there,</v>

3108
02:13:02.480 --> 02:13:04.520
<v Speaker 2>if you work at NBC and you know,</v>

3109
02:13:04.521 --> 02:13:08.870
<v Speaker 2>have coworkers who are having a romantic engagement with another coworker,</v>

3110
02:13:08.990 --> 02:13:11.330
<v Speaker 2>you're obligated to report them to HR.</v>

3111
02:13:11.840 --> 02:13:12.500
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3112
02:13:12.500 --> 02:13:14.450
<v Speaker 2>well you might say no affairs at work.</v>

3113
02:13:14.520 --> 02:13:15.353
<v Speaker 2>Like okay,</v>

3114
02:13:15.650 --> 02:13:18.440
<v Speaker 2>you want to put an informer culture in place to impose that,</v>

3115
02:13:18.441 --> 02:13:19.274
<v Speaker 2>do you?</v>

3116
02:13:19.460 --> 02:13:19.611
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3117
02:13:19.611 --> 02:13:20.444
<v Speaker 2>maybe you do,</v>

3118
02:13:21.140 --> 02:13:25.070
<v Speaker 2>but maybe you should think about it because the cure might be worse than the</v>

3119
02:13:25.071 --> 02:13:25.904
<v Speaker 2>disease.</v>

3120
02:13:26.030 --> 02:13:26.361
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3121
02:13:26.361 --> 02:13:27.194
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3122
02:13:27.260 --> 02:13:31.260
<v Speaker 2>like the evolutionary psychology and biology of makeup at ideal,</v>

3123
02:13:31.261 --> 02:13:32.490
<v Speaker 2>if it's crystal clear,</v>

3124
02:13:32.660 --> 02:13:34.200
<v Speaker 2>you people dispute it that it's like,</v>

3125
02:13:34.201 --> 02:13:39.201
<v Speaker 2>well read the God damn literature more on [inaudible] get so sick of this.</v>

3126
02:13:39.781 --> 02:13:42.630
<v Speaker 2>It's like these aren't opinions that I'm just trying out.</v>

3127
02:13:43.410 --> 02:13:43.950
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3128
02:13:43.950 --> 02:13:45.300
<v Speaker 2>why don't women were rude.</v>

3129
02:13:45.350 --> 02:13:47.130
<v Speaker 2>It's to make the cheeks look like fruit.</v>

3130
02:13:47.310 --> 02:13:49.650
<v Speaker 2>That's why were derived from fruit,</v>

3131
02:13:50.220 --> 02:13:50.641
<v Speaker 2>fruit,</v>

3132
02:13:50.641 --> 02:13:51.600
<v Speaker 2>eating primates.</v>

3133
02:13:51.601 --> 02:13:52.470
<v Speaker 2>We have color vision.</v>

3134
02:13:52.471 --> 02:13:53.370
<v Speaker 2>It's tricor man.</v>

3135
02:13:53.700 --> 02:13:54.750
<v Speaker 2>We pick out fruits,</v>

3136
02:13:54.751 --> 02:13:55.200
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3137
02:13:55.200 --> 02:13:56.640
<v Speaker 2>It's of the lipstick does.</v>

3138
02:13:56.670 --> 02:13:59.080
<v Speaker 2>It also indicates a sexual flush.</v>

3139
02:13:59.430 --> 02:14:00.241
<v Speaker 2>If you don't like that,</v>

3140
02:14:00.241 --> 02:14:01.410
<v Speaker 2>well tough luck for you.</v>

3141
02:14:01.570 --> 02:14:02.390
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>

3142
02:14:02.390 --> 02:14:05.240
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

3143
02:14:05.870 --> 02:14:06.121
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

3144
02:14:06.121 --> 02:14:07.800
<v Speaker 2>in case you and the swell and youthful glow,</v>

3145
02:14:07.801 --> 02:14:09.870
<v Speaker 2>but that's also associated with sexual attraction.</v>

3146
02:14:09.871 --> 02:14:12.930
<v Speaker 2>Just cause that was one of the prime determinants of sexual attractiveness for</v>

3147
02:14:12.931 --> 02:14:13.920
<v Speaker 2>women among men.</v>

3148
02:14:14.640 --> 02:14:18.060
<v Speaker 2>So now I'm not saying that that shouldn't happen at work.</v>

3149
02:14:18.061 --> 02:14:18.900
<v Speaker 2>And then high heels.</v>

3150
02:14:18.901 --> 02:14:19.111
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3151
02:14:19.111 --> 02:14:20.220
<v Speaker 2>Why do you wear high heels?</v>

3152
02:14:20.570 --> 02:14:20.740
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3153
02:14:20.740 --> 02:14:21.810
<v Speaker 2>it's because it's accepted.</v>

3154
02:14:21.840 --> 02:14:26.840
<v Speaker 2>It tilts your hips so that your [inaudible] is that acceptable at work?</v>

3155
02:14:36.010 --> 02:14:36.843
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3156
02:14:37.080 --> 02:14:37.321
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3157
02:14:37.321 --> 02:14:38.460
<v Speaker 2>not of course,</v>

3158
02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:39.340
<v Speaker 2>no one,</v>

3159
02:14:39.340 --> 02:14:41.610
<v Speaker 2>of course perhaps,</v>

3160
02:14:42.240 --> 02:14:45.600
<v Speaker 2>but we can't have a serious discussion on what's acceptable work and what isn't</v>

3161
02:14:45.601 --> 02:14:47.640
<v Speaker 2>because we're to Gambia mature to have the discussion.</v>

3162
02:14:47.641 --> 02:14:50.250
<v Speaker 2>You get to the throw things over the table like that.</v>

3163
02:14:50.550 --> 02:14:53.390
<v Speaker 2>It's like I don't know what the rules should be at my workplace,</v>

3164
02:14:53.430 --> 02:14:54.091
<v Speaker 2>at the university,</v>

3165
02:14:54.091 --> 02:14:59.091
<v Speaker 2>I have been worn in numerable times not to have a discussion with the student,</v>

3166
02:14:59.250 --> 02:15:00.061
<v Speaker 2>male or female,</v>

3167
02:15:00.061 --> 02:15:04.320
<v Speaker 2>but it's the females that are off concerning this particular room with the door</v>

3168
02:15:04.321 --> 02:15:06.210
<v Speaker 2>shut and that's it.</v>

3169
02:15:06.210 --> 02:15:07.620
<v Speaker 2>That's not like six months ago.</v>

3170
02:15:07.621 --> 02:15:08.454
<v Speaker 2>That's not like a free,</v>

3171
02:15:09.080 --> 02:15:11.430
<v Speaker 2>that's like advice from the last 50 years.</v>

3172
02:15:11.580 --> 02:15:13.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't listen to that because I think,</v>

3173
02:15:13.440 --> 02:15:14.100
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

3174
02:15:14.100 --> 02:15:15.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm not living that way,</v>

3175
02:15:16.020 --> 02:15:18.690
<v Speaker 2>but these things are tense.</v>

3176
02:15:18.750 --> 02:15:22.860
<v Speaker 2>They're tense and we won't talk about them intelligently and mature.</v>

3177
02:15:23.310 --> 02:15:23.521
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

3178
02:15:23.521 --> 02:15:28.521
<v Speaker 2>I've also been accused three times in my career of sexual impropriety,</v>

3179
02:15:29.040 --> 02:15:30.600
<v Speaker 2>baseless accusations,</v>

3180
02:15:30.840 --> 02:15:34.380
<v Speaker 2>and the last one really tangled me up for a whole year.</v>

3181
02:15:34.650 --> 02:15:36.900
<v Speaker 2>It's not entertaining,</v>

3182
02:15:37.650 --> 02:15:39.540
<v Speaker 2>so there's plenty to be sorted out.</v>

3183
02:15:39.541 --> 02:15:41.910
<v Speaker 2>But like I said already,</v>

3184
02:15:42.120 --> 02:15:45.240
<v Speaker 2>we live in the delusion of a 13 year old adolescent girl.</v>

3185
02:15:46.610 --> 02:15:49.350
<v Speaker 2>Maintain that level of sophistication.</v>

3186
02:15:49.580 --> 02:15:52.770
<v Speaker 2>We're not to have a real conversation about what rules should govern men and</v>

3187
02:15:52.771 --> 02:15:53.820
<v Speaker 2>women in the workplace.</v>

3188
02:15:54.330 --> 02:15:58.490
<v Speaker 2>So you can't even open the damn discussion of the jumped on like,</v>

3189
02:15:58.700 --> 02:15:59.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3190
02:15:59.420 --> 02:16:04.420
<v Speaker 2>a ray of like rather than heartbeat [inaudible] boots.</v>

3191
02:16:06.401 --> 02:16:09.930
<v Speaker 2>Like it's no bloody wonder the media is dying if you're doing everything they</v>

3192
02:16:09.931 --> 02:16:14.931
<v Speaker 2>possibly can to cut their throats and bleed out as fast [inaudible] performance</v>

3193
02:16:16.800 --> 02:16:17.760
<v Speaker 2>on device devices.</v>

3194
02:16:18.240 --> 02:16:23.240
<v Speaker 2>Some of them are irritated at me about the makeup and ideal thing is I knew</v>

3195
02:16:23.641 --> 02:16:25.060
<v Speaker 2>perfectly well when I said that.</v>

3196
02:16:25.061 --> 02:16:25.351
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

3197
02:16:25.351 --> 02:16:26.090
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

3198
02:16:26.090 --> 02:16:29.150
<v Speaker 2>I'll say this and it's the only Goddamn [inaudible].</v>

3199
02:16:31.200 --> 02:16:32.033
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3200
02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:37.600
<v Speaker 2>but most of the comments that I've written so far have been,</v>

3201
02:16:37.900 --> 02:16:38.261
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3202
02:16:38.261 --> 02:16:38.951
<v Speaker 2>vice guys,</v>

3203
02:16:38.951 --> 02:16:40.840
<v Speaker 2>we know what you're up to him pretty much sick of it.</v>

3204
02:16:41.290 --> 02:16:43.060
<v Speaker 2>And I know that people like Ben Shapiro's,</v>

3205
02:16:43.090 --> 02:16:45.430
<v Speaker 2>he won't repair it now cause it doesn't lie.</v>

3206
02:16:46.180 --> 02:16:48.170
<v Speaker 2>And that's how it pretty damn reason next day.</v>

3207
02:16:48.220 --> 02:16:49.053
<v Speaker 2>I was sure.</v>

3208
02:16:49.060 --> 02:16:52.210
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that really shocked me about channel four in Britain.</v>

3209
02:16:52.360 --> 02:16:53.590
<v Speaker 2>That was the Catholic Newman thing.</v>

3210
02:16:53.920 --> 02:16:58.870
<v Speaker 2>So I walked into that after I had a busy morning doing some other things at the</v>

3211
02:16:58.871 --> 02:16:59.704
<v Speaker 2>studio there.</v>

3212
02:16:59.800 --> 02:17:00.631
<v Speaker 2>I want to get to that.</v>

3213
02:17:00.631 --> 02:17:05.530
<v Speaker 2>And we met Kathy in the green room and she was getting all steamed and crimped</v>

3214
02:17:05.531 --> 02:17:10.531
<v Speaker 2>up and [inaudible] well,</v>

3215
02:17:28.990 --> 02:17:30.220
<v Speaker 2>it's funny when you're on those,</v>

3216
02:17:30.370 --> 02:17:31.210
<v Speaker 2>those new shows,</v>

3217
02:17:31.360 --> 02:17:34.930
<v Speaker 2>because there's always a cloud with people around the hosts and fixing up the</v>

3218
02:17:34.931 --> 02:17:37.330
<v Speaker 2>name nup it's like they're surrounded by bees,</v>

3219
02:17:39.820 --> 02:17:41.380
<v Speaker 2>so it's quite comical for wash.</v>

3220
02:17:41.680 --> 02:17:42.700
<v Speaker 2>And so anyways,</v>

3221
02:17:42.701 --> 02:17:44.510
<v Speaker 2>we went out in front of the cameras were happening,</v>

3222
02:17:44.580 --> 02:17:46.030
<v Speaker 2>perfectly friendly and discussion.</v>

3223
02:17:46.300 --> 02:17:46.600
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3224
02:17:46.600 --> 02:17:50.800
<v Speaker 2>she was all chipper and extroverted and having to find time.</v>

3225
02:17:51.580 --> 02:17:54.810
<v Speaker 2>Then he sat down and we chatted for two minutes and then the cameras went from,</v>

3226
02:17:54.820 --> 02:17:56.410
<v Speaker 2>it was like different person.</v>

3227
02:17:57.150 --> 02:17:57.820
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3228
02:17:57.820 --> 02:17:58.653
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

3229
02:17:58.870 --> 02:18:00.070
<v Speaker 2>I see what's going on here.</v>

3230
02:18:00.540 --> 02:18:01.020
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3231
02:18:01.020 --> 02:18:02.830
<v Speaker 2>but it's this,</v>

3232
02:18:02.980 --> 02:18:03.813
<v Speaker 2>it's this,</v>

3233
02:18:07.360 --> 02:18:10.240
<v Speaker 2>it's a different mode of communication.</v>

3234
02:18:10.960 --> 02:18:14.530
<v Speaker 2>I think noogler gravitating towards youtube because it's rough and ready.</v>

3235
02:18:14.980 --> 02:18:15.281
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3236
02:18:15.281 --> 02:18:16.420
<v Speaker 2>this is why Joe Rogan works.</v>

3237
02:18:16.450 --> 02:18:18.460
<v Speaker 2>It's like chosen are all made up.</v>

3238
02:18:18.461 --> 02:18:21.520
<v Speaker 2>These [inaudible] rear ended,</v>

3239
02:18:21.521 --> 02:18:26.521
<v Speaker 2>the smashed up truck [inaudible] there's no printing the landscape up.</v>

3240
02:18:38.260 --> 02:18:41.500
<v Speaker 2>It's like here's the devotees discussion in this three hours of it.</v>

3241
02:18:41.501 --> 02:18:43.730
<v Speaker 2>If you want to listen less than if you don't,</v>

3242
02:18:43.740 --> 02:18:48.740
<v Speaker 2>then go hell [inaudible] states.</v>

3243
02:18:50.410 --> 02:18:53.290
<v Speaker 2>And it's also something that that's so cool about youtube too is you hear this</v>

3244
02:18:53.291 --> 02:18:56.890
<v Speaker 2>idea that young people have short attention spans.</v>

3245
02:18:57.080 --> 02:18:57.401
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3246
02:18:57.401 --> 02:18:57.820
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3247
02:18:57.820 --> 02:19:01.290
<v Speaker 2>except when it comes to [inaudible].</v>

3248
02:19:01.290 --> 02:19:02.920
<v Speaker 2>So it's very cool to see the shift.</v>

3249
02:19:02.921 --> 02:19:05.410
<v Speaker 2>But a lot of it is that it's a death spiral.</v>

3250
02:19:05.920 --> 02:19:09.490
<v Speaker 2>And I think a lot of the polarization in our society is actually a secondary</v>

3251
02:19:09.491 --> 02:19:09.841
<v Speaker 2>consequence.</v>

3252
02:19:09.841 --> 02:19:10.674
<v Speaker 2>Consequences.</v>

3253
02:19:11.520 --> 02:19:14.380
<v Speaker 2>It's like because the journalists are more than one yesterday and so they're</v>

3254
02:19:14.381 --> 02:19:19.381
<v Speaker 2>just generating clickbait and that's polarizing and hopefully that will stop</v>

3255
02:19:20.320 --> 02:19:25.320
<v Speaker 2>when the doc [inaudible] of junk.</v>

3256
02:19:29.840 --> 02:19:32.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to see the high quality journalists was just fear.</v>

3257
02:19:32.690 --> 02:19:36.140
<v Speaker 2>But I don't think the high quality journalists will dissipated because I think</v>

3258
02:19:36.141 --> 02:19:39.500
<v Speaker 2>their message can move across mediums.</v>

3259
02:19:40.150 --> 02:19:40.641
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>

3260
02:19:40.641 --> 02:19:41.840
<v Speaker 2>when I see CDC,</v>

3261
02:19:42.440 --> 02:19:44.360
<v Speaker 2>I got to watch CNBC struggle on youtube.</v>

3262
02:19:44.361 --> 02:19:45.194
<v Speaker 2>It's so comical.</v>

3263
02:19:46.350 --> 02:19:47.183
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3264
02:19:47.300 --> 02:19:49.760
<v Speaker 2>so I saw somebody with CPC put it on Youtube,</v>

3265
02:19:49.761 --> 02:19:51.950
<v Speaker 2>it was 10 minutes long and I want it to watch it.</v>

3266
02:19:52.820 --> 02:19:57.550
<v Speaker 2>And so I sat down to watch it for three 32nd acts and I taught</v>

3267
02:20:00.110 --> 02:20:02.180
<v Speaker 2>for 10 minutes and you're damn content,</v>

3268
02:20:02.210 --> 02:20:06.470
<v Speaker 2>you really think I should pay a minute and a half of my time to watch 10 minutes</v>

3269
02:20:06.471 --> 02:20:07.280
<v Speaker 2>of your condoms.</v>

3270
02:20:07.280 --> 02:20:08.970
<v Speaker 2>Then I couldn't click through the outs.</v>

3271
02:20:09.260 --> 02:20:10.093
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3272
02:20:10.100 --> 02:20:11.240
<v Speaker 2>so rule number one,</v>

3273
02:20:11.330 --> 02:20:12.050
<v Speaker 2>one app,</v>

3274
02:20:12.050 --> 02:20:13.130
<v Speaker 2>15 seconds long,</v>

3275
02:20:13.190 --> 02:20:14.490
<v Speaker 2>you can click through it for SAP.</v>

3276
02:20:14.780 --> 02:20:15.470
<v Speaker 2>That's the rule.</v>

3277
02:20:15.470 --> 02:20:18.700
<v Speaker 2>Not Three 32nd ads that you have to sit through.</v>

3278
02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.200
<v Speaker 2>It's like have a little respect for the media.</v>

3279
02:20:21.470 --> 02:20:22.190
<v Speaker 2>It's like no,</v>

3280
02:20:22.190 --> 02:20:23.023
<v Speaker 2>no respect.</v>

3281
02:20:23.510 --> 02:20:25.910
<v Speaker 2>Then upon comments were um,</v>

3282
02:20:26.760 --> 02:20:27.500
<v Speaker 2>no one lot,</v>

3283
02:20:27.500 --> 02:20:32.500
<v Speaker 2>just a lot to do that because your viewers actually get to the comments and if</v>

3284
02:20:33.441 --> 02:20:35.810
<v Speaker 2>you can't hire someone to vet them,</v>

3285
02:20:35.820 --> 02:20:37.610
<v Speaker 2>you can just leaving the down and comments alone.</v>

3286
02:20:37.611 --> 02:20:38.470
<v Speaker 2>That would be one thing.</v>

3287
02:20:38.510 --> 02:20:39.530
<v Speaker 2>Just let them happen.</v>

3288
02:20:39.890 --> 02:20:40.570
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3289
02:20:40.570 --> 02:20:44.240
<v Speaker 2>maybe you need someone to weed out the ones that are like so wretched that you</v>

3290
02:20:44.241 --> 02:20:44.370
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

3291
02:20:44.370 --> 02:20:47.380
<v Speaker 2>we need to tell that you know what's up.</v>

3292
02:20:47.960 --> 02:20:50.320
<v Speaker 2>What would you call some demented troll,</v>

3293
02:20:51.600 --> 02:20:52.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3294
02:20:52.200 --> 02:20:53.690
<v Speaker 2>but maybe you can just leave them alone.</v>

3295
02:20:54.130 --> 02:20:55.670
<v Speaker 2>They won't pay any attention to the media.</v>

3296
02:20:56.150 --> 02:20:57.470
<v Speaker 2>And so I look at that.</v>

3297
02:20:57.471 --> 02:20:58.580
<v Speaker 2>I think it's no bunny wonder,</v>

3298
02:20:58.610 --> 02:20:59.930
<v Speaker 2>you guys can't get any traction.</v>

3299
02:20:59.960 --> 02:21:02.000
<v Speaker 2>You've got no respect for the medium whatsoever.</v>

3300
02:21:02.450 --> 02:21:03.830
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to make the transition.</v>

3301
02:21:04.370 --> 02:21:07.730
<v Speaker 2>So I'm irritated that CDC and that's kind of good reason to,</v>

3302
02:21:08.210 --> 02:21:09.870
<v Speaker 2>and that sort of like,</v>

3303
02:21:09.900 --> 02:21:13.280
<v Speaker 2>it's coming towards the media in general,</v>

3304
02:21:13.310 --> 02:21:14.540
<v Speaker 2>but they're in serious trouble.</v>

3305
02:21:14.870 --> 02:21:15.703
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3306
02:21:15.800 --> 02:21:17.600
<v Speaker 2>so vice was a perfect example of that.</v>

3307
02:21:17.601 --> 02:21:19.460
<v Speaker 2>It's like you talk for two hours.</v>

3308
02:21:19.461 --> 02:21:20.294
<v Speaker 2>When they do,</v>

3309
02:21:20.390 --> 02:21:23.980
<v Speaker 2>they take the most contentious part of it just to show how damn smart they are.</v>

3310
02:21:23.981 --> 02:21:26.580
<v Speaker 2>And you'll pick the people who are watching it to see through it,</v>

3311
02:21:26.600 --> 02:21:27.433
<v Speaker 2>which they could.</v>

3312
02:21:27.740 --> 02:21:29.300
<v Speaker 2>It's like to hell with you guys.</v>

3313
02:21:29.301 --> 02:21:29.750
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3314
02:21:29.750 --> 02:21:31.130
<v Speaker 2>that's so cheap and wretched.</v>

3315
02:21:31.450 --> 02:21:32.283
<v Speaker 2>It's pathetic.</v>

3316
02:21:32.450 --> 02:21:33.650
<v Speaker 2>It's absolutely pathetic.</v>

3317
02:21:33.920 --> 02:21:35.740
<v Speaker 2>All you're doing is making things worse.</v>

3318
02:21:36.040 --> 02:21:38.830
<v Speaker 2>In in Lindsay shepherd situations,</v>

3319
02:21:38.831 --> 02:21:43.831
<v Speaker 2>she was recording her own side just as insurance fraud and dishonesty from the</v>

3320
02:21:43.851 --> 02:21:44.600
<v Speaker 2>other side.</v>

3321
02:21:44.600 --> 02:21:44.871
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3322
02:21:44.871 --> 02:21:45.051
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3323
02:21:45.051 --> 02:21:47.960
<v Speaker 2>that's another thing that I've often thought about it is just to record the</v>

3324
02:21:47.961 --> 02:21:48.794
<v Speaker 2>whole interview,</v>

3325
02:21:48.830 --> 02:21:52.310
<v Speaker 2>but I'm more or less willing at the moment to let the chips fall where they</v>

3326
02:21:52.311 --> 02:21:52.910
<v Speaker 2>will.</v>

3327
02:21:52.910 --> 02:21:53.721
<v Speaker 2>And most of the time,</v>

3328
02:21:53.721 --> 02:21:53.961
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3329
02:21:53.961 --> 02:21:58.961
<v Speaker 2>most of the time there are many people with whom I've sat down and had</v>

3330
02:21:59.331 --> 02:22:02.450
<v Speaker 2>discussions where things were played straight.</v>

3331
02:22:02.510 --> 02:22:04.580
<v Speaker 2>And I would say it's actually the majority,</v>

3332
02:22:05.240 --> 02:22:09.260
<v Speaker 2>but there's a pretty pernicious minority that does what?</v>

3333
02:22:09.261 --> 02:22:09.920
<v Speaker 2>Vice,</v>

3334
02:22:09.920 --> 02:22:10.753
<v Speaker 2>it's like</v>

3335
02:22:11.840 --> 02:22:12.830
<v Speaker 2>there's no excuse for them.</v>

3336
02:22:13.550 --> 02:22:14.420
<v Speaker 2>There's no excuse for it.</v>

3337
02:22:15.200 --> 02:22:16.033
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3338
02:22:16.690 --> 02:22:17.700
<v Speaker 2>you've got no principles.</v>

3339
02:22:18.920 --> 02:22:20.330
<v Speaker 2>Let's make this salacious.</v>

3340
02:22:20.390 --> 02:22:20.691
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3341
02:22:20.691 --> 02:22:21.590
<v Speaker 2>these things are important.</v>

3342
02:22:21.591 --> 02:22:22.424
<v Speaker 2>You Morons.</v>

3343
02:22:22.660 --> 02:22:22.941
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3344
02:22:22.941 --> 02:22:23.774
<v Speaker 2>get it together.</v>

3345
02:22:24.050 --> 02:22:25.830
<v Speaker 2>Don't muck about hell.</v>

3346
02:22:25.840 --> 02:22:25.980
<v Speaker 2>You</v>
