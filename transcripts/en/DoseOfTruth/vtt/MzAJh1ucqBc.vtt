00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.280
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to the Hypothalamus,</v>

2
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.810
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm no expert on hypothalamic</v>

3
00:00:15.811 --> 00:00:18.780
<v Speaker 1>function and I had to pound by way</v>
<v Speaker 1>through Swanson's paper because it's</v>

4
00:00:18.781 --> 00:00:22.500
<v Speaker 1>quite complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the hypothalamus is sort of the</v>

5
00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:25.830
<v Speaker 1>nexus between the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mind and the body.</v>

6
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.670
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking about it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very good at monitoring your body,</v>

7
00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:33.420
<v Speaker 1>the states of your body and it can</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out basically when your blood</v>

8
00:00:33.421 --> 00:00:36.810
<v Speaker 1>sugar's too low and when you need water</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you don't.</v>

9
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.740
<v Speaker 1>Exactly remember how it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.270
<v Speaker 1>associated with the regulation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>breathing because I suspect that that's</v>

11
00:00:42.271 --> 00:00:44.940
<v Speaker 1>a different system and I don't remember</v>
<v Speaker 1>that being a subcomponent of the</v>

12
00:00:44.941 --> 00:00:48.090
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does also regulate things like</v>

13
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.990
<v Speaker 1>sexual behavior and sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual attraction and temperature</v>

14
00:00:51.991 --> 00:00:54.780
<v Speaker 1>regulation and excretion and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

15
00:00:54.781 --> 00:00:59.250
<v Speaker 1>all the things that you would associate</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the basic biological functions that</v>

16
00:00:59.251 --> 00:01:01.440
<v Speaker 1>come along with being a complex animal.</v>

17
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.740
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we share those functions way down the</v>

18
00:01:04.741 --> 00:01:06.690
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary chain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

19
00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:09.600
<v Speaker 1>we share a lot of the functions with</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that moves,</v>

20
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.510
<v Speaker 1>approach and avoidance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We share with pretty much everything</v>

21
00:01:12.511 --> 00:01:15.450
<v Speaker 1>that moves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the time you get to the higher</v>

22
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.550
<v Speaker 1>mammalian functions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.760
<v Speaker 1>we share those with pretty much all</v>
<v Speaker 1>mammals.</v>

24
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.430
<v Speaker 1>That's partly why we can understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>mammals pretty well.</v>

25
00:01:23.431 --> 00:01:25.620
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you can kind of have a lizard as a</v>

26
00:01:25.621 --> 00:01:28.410
<v Speaker 1>pet and some of them are more social</v>
<v Speaker 1>than others,</v>

27
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.300
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to really have a pad,</v>

28
00:01:30.301 --> 00:01:34.050
<v Speaker 1>it has to be a mammal and it's even</v>
<v Speaker 1>better if it's a social mammal like a,</v>

29
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.950
<v Speaker 1>like a dog because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can understand dogs and they can</v>

30
00:01:37.951 --> 00:01:41.040
<v Speaker 1>understand you because they are</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchical animals and they have the</v>

31
00:01:41.041 --> 00:01:45.180
<v Speaker 1>same roughly the same set of biological</v>
<v Speaker 1>functions that you do.</v>

32
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their brains are organized around smell</v>

33
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.170
<v Speaker 1>and not around vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And almost all animals are like that</v>

34
00:01:52.171 --> 00:01:54.510
<v Speaker 1>except for people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe hunting birds,</v>

35
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.430
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's one thing that really</v>

36
00:01:56.431 --> 00:02:01.431
<v Speaker 1>distinguishes us from dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're similar enough in neuron body</v>

37
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.830
<v Speaker 1>behavior so that we can directly relate</v>
<v Speaker 1>to dogs.</v>

38
00:02:04.831 --> 00:02:06.360
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can even play.</v>
