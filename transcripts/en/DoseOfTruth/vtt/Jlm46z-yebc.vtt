1
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh sent and called Joseph because he had talked to his,</v>

2
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.760
<v Speaker 1>his Butler and they brought him hastily out of the Dungeon and Joseph shaved</v>

3
00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:17.820
<v Speaker 1>himself and changed his clothes and came in unto Pharaoh.</v>

4
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.110
<v Speaker 1>I guess he didn't want to shock pharaoh with how people dressed in the prison.</v>

5
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.000
<v Speaker 1>And Pharaoh said Unto Joseph,</v>

6
00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:26.280
<v Speaker 1>I've dreamed a dream and there is none that can interpret it.</v>

7
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.160
<v Speaker 1>And I've heard say if d that you can understand the dream to interpret it.</v>

8
00:00:29.161 --> 00:00:29.994
<v Speaker 1>And Joseph said,</v>

9
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.990
<v Speaker 1>it's not me.</v>

10
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.860
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

11
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.770
<v Speaker 1>God will give Pharaoh and answer of peace.</v>

12
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.420
<v Speaker 1>It's so Jacob isn't taking credit for his ability to interpret dreams,</v>

13
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.490
<v Speaker 1>which also indicates quite interestingly,</v>

14
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.090
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

15
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.050
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing that despite the fact that he's successful and competent,</v>

16
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.430
<v Speaker 1>he's not narcissistic.</v>

17
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.320
<v Speaker 1>Like if he happens to have this gift,</v>

18
00:00:49.321 --> 00:00:52.410
<v Speaker 1>he regards it as a gift and not as something that,</v>

19
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:53.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

20
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.390
<v Speaker 1>redounds his favor.</v>

21
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.490
<v Speaker 1>It's just something that he happens to be able to do.</v>

22
00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:57.510
<v Speaker 1>And so that's,</v>

23
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.680
<v Speaker 1>that's a hallmark of someone who's got a pretty well put together personality as</v>

24
00:01:01.681 --> 00:01:04.140
<v Speaker 1>far as I'm concerned because you know,</v>

25
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.800
<v Speaker 1>people have gifts that they didn't really earn.</v>

26
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.970
<v Speaker 1>Those would be your talents,</v>

27
00:01:08.971 --> 00:01:09.751
<v Speaker 1>your intelligence,</v>

28
00:01:09.751 --> 00:01:12.090
<v Speaker 1>your good looks if you happen to have good looks,</v>

29
00:01:12.091 --> 00:01:12.924
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

30
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.720
<v Speaker 1>and they're not,</v>

31
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.830
<v Speaker 1>there's no sense being all puffed up about that because it's,</v>

32
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.741
<v Speaker 1>it's great.</v>

33
00:01:18.741 --> 00:01:23.060
<v Speaker 1>It's luck of the draw though and the proper attitude is to note that it's luck</v>

34
00:01:23.061 --> 00:01:24.470
<v Speaker 1>of the draw and to be grateful for it.</v>

35
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.463
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

36
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.180
<v Speaker 1>it's quite a fine painting.</v>

37
00:01:32.181 --> 00:01:33.014
<v Speaker 1>That one</v>

38
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.420
<v Speaker 1>hold their come seven years of great,</v>

39
00:01:38.421 --> 00:01:41.720
<v Speaker 1>plenty throughout the land of Egypt and then there shall arise after them seven</v>

40
00:01:41.721 --> 00:01:44.780
<v Speaker 1>years of famine and all the Plenti shall be forgotten and the famine shall</v>

41
00:01:44.781 --> 00:01:48.170
<v Speaker 1>consume the land and the Plenti shall not be known in the land.</v>

42
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.080
<v Speaker 1>I reason of that famine following sh fort Shelby,</v>

43
00:01:51.081 --> 00:01:51.920
<v Speaker 1>very grievous.</v>

44
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.320
<v Speaker 1>So now we see to that Jacob,</v>

45
00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.420
<v Speaker 1>he can interpret dreams,</v>

46
00:01:57.421 --> 00:02:01.230
<v Speaker 1>but he's also the sort of person who can look into the future and think this is</v>

47
00:02:01.231 --> 00:02:05.850
<v Speaker 1>sort of what Adam was called on to do when he got kicked out of the garden of</v>

48
00:02:05.851 --> 00:02:09.480
<v Speaker 1>Paradise is you're going to be able to conceptualize that even if things are</v>

49
00:02:09.481 --> 00:02:10.560
<v Speaker 1>going well now,</v>

50
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.500
<v Speaker 1>that that doesn't mean that they're going to go well into the future.</v>

51
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.070
<v Speaker 1>And so he's the aunt and not the grasshopper,</v>

52
00:02:17.071 --> 00:02:19.020
<v Speaker 1>right in the grasshopper and the ants story,</v>

53
00:02:19.021 --> 00:02:20.310
<v Speaker 1>it's like everything's good,</v>

54
00:02:20.311 --> 00:02:24.450
<v Speaker 1>but you should wake the hell up and you should test to see how things can go</v>

55
00:02:24.451 --> 00:02:28.640
<v Speaker 1>wrong and you can see if your systems can survive them.</v>

56
00:02:28.641 --> 00:02:33.641
<v Speaker 1>Things going wrong and which is something that I think we could all Harken to</v>

57
00:02:33.891 --> 00:02:37.310
<v Speaker 1>because I think we do a very bad job in the modern world of testing to see if</v>

58
00:02:37.311 --> 00:02:38.540
<v Speaker 1>our systems can go wrong.</v>
