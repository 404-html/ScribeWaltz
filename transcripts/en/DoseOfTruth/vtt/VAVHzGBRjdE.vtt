1
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.400
<v Speaker 1>Field when he was,</v>

2
00:00:08.401 --> 00:00:12.630
<v Speaker 1>he did some of the early cycle surgery for epilepsy because it intractable</v>

3
00:00:12.631 --> 00:00:13.231
<v Speaker 1>epilepsy.</v>

4
00:00:13.231 --> 00:00:15.420
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes the only thing to do is radical surgery,</v>

5
00:00:15.421 --> 00:00:16.254
<v Speaker 1>like a corpus.</v>

6
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.240
<v Speaker 1>He caught the Corpus callosum for example.</v>

7
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.283
<v Speaker 1>So that the,</v>

8
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:20.191
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

10
00:00:20.191 --> 00:00:21.960
<v Speaker 1>the electrical storm so to speak,</v>

11
00:00:21.961 --> 00:00:25.480
<v Speaker 1>can't transmit across the hemispheres and the whole brain won't be effective.</v>

12
00:00:25.481 --> 00:00:26.250
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

13
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.570
<v Speaker 1>but while he was doing that,</v>

14
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.220
<v Speaker 1>he used a little electrode to map out the surface of the brain and he mapped out</v>

15
00:00:32.221 --> 00:00:32.971
<v Speaker 1>the motor strip,</v>

16
00:00:32.971 --> 00:00:35.490
<v Speaker 1>which is just behind the prefrontal cortex.</v>

17
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.930
<v Speaker 1>And then the sensory strip,</v>

18
00:00:36.931 --> 00:00:41.560
<v Speaker 1>which is just behind that to find out how the body representatives are,</v>

19
00:00:41.561 --> 00:00:43.080
<v Speaker 1>the brain represents the body.</v>

20
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.740
<v Speaker 1>And basically what he showed was that on the motor strip,</v>

21
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.353
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

23
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.410
<v Speaker 1>the thumb has as much representation as your whole trunk.</v>

24
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.910
<v Speaker 1>So basically your thumb is as smart from a motoric perspective,</v>

25
00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.580
<v Speaker 1>smarter than you from here to here,</v>

26
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:00.151
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

27
00:01:00.151 --> 00:01:03.180
<v Speaker 1>well try picking up something with your back,</v>

28
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.760
<v Speaker 1>and you'll figure out exactly why that is.</v>

30
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.720
<v Speaker 1>And the thumb basically has almost as much representation as the rest of the</v>

31
00:01:09.721 --> 00:01:10.081
<v Speaker 1>hand.</v>

32
00:01:10.081 --> 00:01:12.780
<v Speaker 1>But the hands are like gigantic balloons,</v>

33
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:01:13.511 --> 00:01:15.780
<v Speaker 1>and the arms are a little skinny sticks here,</v>

35
00:01:15.781 --> 00:01:16.370
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

36
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:17.880
<v Speaker 1>theater fairly highly</v>

37
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.671
<v Speaker 1>represented,</v>

38
00:01:20.671 --> 00:01:23.400
<v Speaker 1>especially in the sensory cortex because you know,</v>

39
00:01:23.401 --> 00:01:24.870
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be careful about what you,</v>

40
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.130
<v Speaker 1>what you step on.</v>

41
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.180
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that's very interesting about the representation of the</v>

42
00:01:30.181 --> 00:01:33.900
<v Speaker 1>feet on the sensory strip is that it's right beside the representation of the</v>

43
00:01:33.901 --> 00:01:34.770
<v Speaker 1>Genitalia.</v>

44
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.600
<v Speaker 1>And so there's cross costs.</v>

45
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.380
<v Speaker 1>And so some of you are pretty into foot massages and that's why,</v>

46
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.191
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

47
00:01:41.191 --> 00:01:41.681
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>

48
00:01:41.681 --> 00:01:41.921
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

49
00:01:41.921 --> 00:01:43.590
<v Speaker 1>it's a consequence of the overlap.</v>

50
00:01:43.591 --> 00:01:45.300
<v Speaker 1>Now why that overlap is there,</v>

51
00:01:45.301 --> 00:01:46.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly,</v>

52
00:01:46.501 --> 00:01:46.681
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:01:46.681 --> 00:01:49.920
<v Speaker 1>maybe maybe the brain had organized itself.</v>

54
00:01:49.921 --> 00:01:52.140
<v Speaker 1>So particularly sensitive surfaces.</v>

55
00:01:52.141 --> 00:01:54.210
<v Speaker 1>We're taking advantage of the same tissue,</v>

56
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.380
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

57
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.311
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

58
00:01:56.311 --> 00:01:57.720
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting case of,</v>

59
00:01:57.721 --> 00:02:00.060
<v Speaker 1>it's like synesthesia and sent in a sense,</v>

60
00:02:00.061 --> 00:02:01.560
<v Speaker 1>it's like sensory synesthesia.</v>

61
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:02.401
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

62
00:02:02.401 --> 00:02:03.234
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

63
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.070
<v Speaker 1>as far as your brain's concerned,</v>

64
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.720
<v Speaker 1>your all hands and your hands are almost all thumb and you're quite a bit of</v>

65
00:02:09.721 --> 00:02:13.380
<v Speaker 1>feet and your lips are massive and so is your tongue.</v>

66
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.990
<v Speaker 1>And your face is very highly represented too.</v>

67
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.610
<v Speaker 1>So basically as far as your brain is concerned with regards to sensory input and</v>

68
00:02:20.611 --> 00:02:21.444
<v Speaker 1>motor output,</v>

69
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.890
<v Speaker 1>you're this huge face with great big lips and tongue and you have massive</v>

70
00:02:25.891 --> 00:02:28.560
<v Speaker 1>balloon like hands and your feet are pretty big too.</v>

71
00:02:28.561 --> 00:02:32.940
<v Speaker 1>And there's a fair bit of sensory representation for the Genitalia as well.</v>

72
00:02:32.941 --> 00:02:34.770
<v Speaker 1>And then the body's hardly there at all.</v>

73
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.960
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

74
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.680
<v Speaker 1>so that's kind of what a human being is like,</v>

75
00:02:37.681 --> 00:02:37.950
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

76
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.220
<v Speaker 1>We're all thumbs in hands and we talk about what we do with our thumbs and hands</v>

77
00:02:41.221 --> 00:02:44.700
<v Speaker 1>all the time when we take things apart with them and we put them together and</v>

78
00:02:44.701 --> 00:02:46.500
<v Speaker 1>then we tell everybody else how we're doing that.</v>

79
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.510
<v Speaker 1>And that's basically a human being.</v>

80
00:02:48.511 --> 00:02:52.800
<v Speaker 1>And when you're thinking about the difference between human beings and highly</v>

81
00:02:52.801 --> 00:02:56.490
<v Speaker 1>encephalitis mammals like dolphins and whales,</v>

82
00:02:56.491 --> 00:03:00.280
<v Speaker 1>because people have claimed that dolphins and whales are extraordinarily</v>

83
00:03:00.281 --> 00:03:01.114
<v Speaker 1>intelligent.</v>

84
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.601
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

85
00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:04.990
<v Speaker 1>dolphins don't seem particularly simple minded,</v>

86
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.490
<v Speaker 1>but look at the things they're in.</v>

87
00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:08.890
<v Speaker 1>Like if they're in these test tube shaped bodies,</v>

88
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:09.753
<v Speaker 1>what are they gonna do?</v>

89
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.620
<v Speaker 1>Flip sand up into buildings?</v>

90
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.510
<v Speaker 1>It's like they can't manage that.</v>

91
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.040
<v Speaker 1>And so the embodied the,</v>

92
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.870
<v Speaker 1>the manner in which their nervous system is embodied turns out to be</v>

93
00:03:19.871 --> 00:03:22.960
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily important when you're trying to understand something like the</v>

94
00:03:22.961 --> 00:03:24.730
<v Speaker 1>relationship between cortical tissue,</v>

95
00:03:24.731 --> 00:03:26.440
<v Speaker 1>mass and intelligence,</v>

96
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.630
<v Speaker 1>you can't just think about mind as something that's floating like a soul in</v>

97
00:03:31.631 --> 00:03:32.464
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>

98
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.320
<v Speaker 1>If it isn't stuck in something that you can use,</v>

99
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.120
<v Speaker 1>it's not particularly good for anything or anything that human beings would</v>

100
00:03:40.121 --> 00:03:42.320
<v Speaker 1>regard as particularly intelligence.</v>
