00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.180
<v Speaker 1>How can women who waited too long to have children find meaning in their lives</v>

2
00:00:05.181 --> 00:00:06.680
<v Speaker 1>once they realized their mistake?</v>

3
00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.660
<v Speaker 1>How can we cope with the regret?</v>

4
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.571
<v Speaker 1>Jesus?</v>

5
00:00:11.571 --> 00:00:12.560
<v Speaker 1>That's a hard question.</v>

6
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:16.341
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

7
00:00:16.341 --> 00:00:17.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.400
<v Speaker 1>there are other avenues to meaning,</v>

9
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:20.660
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

10
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.493
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

11
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:23.000
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

12
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.390
<v Speaker 1>that's the first thing to realize is that there are,</v>

13
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:27.800
<v Speaker 1>there's intimate relationship,</v>

14
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.630
<v Speaker 1>there's familial relationships that aren't in accordance with children.</v>

15
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.570
<v Speaker 1>There's other people that you can serve.</v>

16
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.670
<v Speaker 1>There are other children that you can serve.</v>

17
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.380
<v Speaker 1>So what you have to do,</v>

18
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.070
<v Speaker 1>because intimate relationships are so important,</v>

19
00:00:43.071 --> 00:00:45.410
<v Speaker 1>and I'm including that close familial,</v>

20
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about sexual relationships.</v>

21
00:00:47.151 --> 00:00:49.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about very close social relationships.</v>

22
00:00:49.011 --> 00:00:50.750
<v Speaker 1>The thing about having children,</v>

23
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.310
<v Speaker 1>if you're lucky,</v>

24
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.510
<v Speaker 1>is that you have a relationship there of a depth that you don't get anywhere</v>

25
00:00:56.511 --> 00:01:00.500
<v Speaker 1>else with the possible exception of your parents and siblings and your partner.</v>

26
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.150
<v Speaker 1>But there's something about the child relationship that's even more fundamental</v>

27
00:01:05.151 --> 00:01:09.200
<v Speaker 1>because the thing about having a child is that if you have any sense,</v>

28
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:10.460
<v Speaker 1>as soon as you have a child,</v>

29
00:01:10.461 --> 00:01:12.320
<v Speaker 1>you are no longer the most important person,</v>

30
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:13.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

31
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.920
<v Speaker 1>You're no longer the person that you have primary responsibility for.</v>

32
00:01:15.921 --> 00:01:16.820
<v Speaker 1>It's now your child.</v>

33
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.870
<v Speaker 1>And that produces a psychological transformation and it produces a relationship</v>

34
00:01:20.871 --> 00:01:23.210
<v Speaker 1>of a depth that can't be easily duplicated elsewhere.</v>

35
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.660
<v Speaker 1>But it's not like that's the only thing that there is to do in life.</v>

36
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.411
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

37
00:01:27.411 --> 00:01:28.244
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

38
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.960
<v Speaker 1>there are other relationships and I would say what you do is you foster them to</v>

39
00:01:32.961 --> 00:01:34.280
<v Speaker 1>the degree that that's possible.</v>

40
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.440
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you could find other kids to serve.</v>

41
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:37.041
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

42
00:01:37.041 --> 00:01:39.680
<v Speaker 1>there's always the possibility of volunteering for hospitals or,</v>

43
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:40.400
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

44
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.180
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

45
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.030
<v Speaker 1>or working in places where children need service.</v>

46
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.770
<v Speaker 1>So that's a possibility as well.</v>

47
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.380
<v Speaker 1>And so you've,</v>

48
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.190
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>

50
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.820
<v Speaker 1>there are a variety of sources of meaning in people's lives and they're,</v>

51
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:53.870
<v Speaker 1>they're not unlimited.</v>

52
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.321
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

53
00:01:54.321 --> 00:01:55.011
<v Speaker 1>there's career,</v>

54
00:01:55.011 --> 00:01:55.850
<v Speaker 1>there's education,</v>

55
00:01:55.851 --> 00:01:57.650
<v Speaker 1>there's what you do that's meaningful,</v>

56
00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.570
<v Speaker 1>meaningfully engages you outside of work.</v>

57
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.010
<v Speaker 1>There's your social relations,</v>

58
00:02:01.011 --> 00:02:02.690
<v Speaker 1>your friends and so forth.</v>

59
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.950
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe you have five lakes lakes to stand on and you missed one cause he</v>

60
00:02:06.951 --> 00:02:07.611
<v Speaker 1>didn't have kids.</v>

61
00:02:07.611 --> 00:02:09.980
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe you miss too because kids are a big deal.</v>

62
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.620
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't mean the rest of them aren't accessible to you.</v>

63
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.760
<v Speaker 1>And so you optimize your functioning along the dimensions that are left to you.</v>

64
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.440
<v Speaker 1>And then I would also say maybe you tried to forgive yourself a little bit.</v>

65
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.311
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

66
00:02:22.311 --> 00:02:24.890
<v Speaker 1>like it's very difficult to go through life without</v>

67
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.450
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

68
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.410
<v Speaker 1>Without regrets,</v>

69
00:02:27.411 --> 00:02:28.700
<v Speaker 1>without making mistakes.</v>

70
00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:29.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

71
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.940
<v Speaker 1>when you can't beat yourself to death for it because then everyone would beat</v>

72
00:02:31.941 --> 00:02:33.290
<v Speaker 1>themselves to death all the time.</v>

73
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.030
<v Speaker 1>And so you think,</v>

74
00:02:35.031 --> 00:02:36.170
<v Speaker 1>well that's,</v>

75
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:37.700
<v Speaker 1>that's I've,</v>

76
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

77
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm too soon old and too late wise to use an old cliche and you think,</v>

78
00:02:44.151 --> 00:02:45.710
<v Speaker 1>well that's the law of mankind.</v>

79
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.680
<v Speaker 1>We learn things too late often and that's too bad.</v>

80
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.890
<v Speaker 1>And you forgive yourself because you're stupid and you don't know what you're</v>

81
00:02:51.891 --> 00:02:53.990
<v Speaker 1>doing and you're unwise just like everyone else.</v>

82
00:02:53.991 --> 00:02:56.630
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you're somewhat capable of learning if you're careful.</v>

83
00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.540
<v Speaker 1>And then you go out and you try to foster and do good in the world to the degree</v>

84
00:03:01.541 --> 00:03:04.480
<v Speaker 1>that you can outside of the necessity of,</v>

85
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.063
<v Speaker 1>of children.</v>

86
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.650
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you have nephews,</v>

87
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.141
<v Speaker 1>nieces,</v>

88
00:03:08.141 --> 00:03:12.250
<v Speaker 1>and you can lavish some attention on them and find your substitute where you</v>

89
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:13.084
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>

90
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.820
<v Speaker 1>But I would say to forgive yourself is a big part of that.</v>

91
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.230
<v Speaker 1>It's like people make mistakes,</v>

92
00:03:17.231 --> 00:03:18.610
<v Speaker 1>mad big mistakes.</v>

93
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.300
<v Speaker 1>And the people that I've watched through life that have been successful,</v>

94
00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:25.570
<v Speaker 1>it's not like they didn't make mistakes because everyone makes mistakes and they</v>

95
00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:29.350
<v Speaker 1>do things they regret and they miss opportunities and it's a bloody catastrophe,</v>

96
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.750
<v Speaker 1>but they treat themselves with some degree of mercy along with the justice.</v>

97
00:03:34.751 --> 00:03:35.081
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

98
00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:35.351
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

99
00:03:35.351 --> 00:03:38.740
<v Speaker 1>well I screwed up there and I'm going to try to learn and I'm not going to do it</v>

100
00:03:38.741 --> 00:03:39.280
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

101
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.520
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not going to beat myself to death so that I can't get up again.</v>

102
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.670
<v Speaker 1>And so you do what you can to forgive yourself.</v>

103
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.361
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

104
00:03:46.361 --> 00:03:50.260
<v Speaker 1>it's a confusing time to live in in many ways because we have the birth control</v>

105
00:03:50.261 --> 00:03:54.310
<v Speaker 1>pill now and that means reproduction has now become voluntary.</v>

106
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:55.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

107
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.010
<v Speaker 1>when's a good time to reproduce?</v>

108
00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.491
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

109
00:03:57.491 --> 00:03:58.300
<v Speaker 1>never,</v>

110
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.970
<v Speaker 1>because who would ever think about doing that?</v>

111
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.970
<v Speaker 1>It's so ridiculously irrational and complicated and the burden of responsibility</v>

112
00:04:06.341 --> 00:04:09.280
<v Speaker 1>is so insanely high and you never secure enough to,</v>

113
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.280
<v Speaker 1>to have the proper place to bring children into the world.</v>

114
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.440
<v Speaker 1>And you have to get your career going and your,</v>

115
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.690
<v Speaker 1>and your intimate relationship.</v>

116
00:04:16.691 --> 00:04:19.540
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you have some struggle doing that and one day you wake up and it's a</v>

117
00:04:19.541 --> 00:04:20.374
<v Speaker 1>bit late.</v>

118
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.831
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

119
00:04:20.831 --> 00:04:21.101
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

120
00:04:21.101 --> 00:04:24.220
<v Speaker 1>well you're a product of your time.</v>

121
00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:30.420
<v Speaker 1>And one of the prices that we're going to pay for having birth control for</v>

122
00:04:30.521 --> 00:04:35.521
<v Speaker 1>having reliable contraception is that some people are going to make the wrong</v>

123
00:04:35.741 --> 00:04:37.480
<v Speaker 1>decision with regards to having children.</v>

124
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.210
<v Speaker 1>And then you view yourself as a product of your time.</v>

125
00:04:40.211 --> 00:04:41.350
<v Speaker 1>And that's a catastrophe,</v>

126
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

127
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.890
<v Speaker 1>because to be a product of your time is in some ways a catastrophe.</v>

128
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.353
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

129
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.800
<v Speaker 1>but there's other things to do in life and,</v>

130
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.590
<v Speaker 1>and augering yourself into the ground with regret and,</v>

131
00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:54.370
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

132
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:55.203
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

133
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.750
<v Speaker 1>and self recrimination is not useful.</v>

134
00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.650
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

135
00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.921
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

136
00:04:59.921 --> 00:05:01.000
<v Speaker 1>you have to learn your lesson,</v>

137
00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:01.900
<v Speaker 1>you have to take your lumps,</v>

138
00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:02.734
<v Speaker 1>all of that,</v>

139
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.620
<v Speaker 1>but have some mercy.</v>

140
00:05:05.621 --> 00:05:06.454
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

141
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.261
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

142
00:05:08.261 --> 00:05:08.470
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
