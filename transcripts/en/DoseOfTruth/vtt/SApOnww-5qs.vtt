1
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.630
<v Speaker 1>Were these differences in belief systems?</v>

2
00:00:09.631 --> 00:00:10.680
<v Speaker 1>Just arbitrary.</v>

3
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.900
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually a postmodern question.</v>

4
00:00:12.901 --> 00:00:14.100
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that at the time.</v>

5
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.180
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

6
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.720
<v Speaker 1>because you might say the postmodernists do say there's a very large number of</v>

7
00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:23.721
<v Speaker 1>ways of interpreting the world and it isn't obvious how you determine which of</v>

8
00:00:24.181 --> 00:00:28.170
<v Speaker 1>those ways are correct and so perhaps you can't determine that any of them are</v>

9
00:00:28.171 --> 00:00:28.980
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>

10
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.000
<v Speaker 1>And then as a consequence of your inability to determine if any of them are</v>

11
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:33.451
<v Speaker 1>correct,</v>

12
00:00:33.451 --> 00:00:38.451
<v Speaker 1>then you have to turn to something like power dispute to establish which</v>

13
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.770
<v Speaker 1>interpretation is going to take precedence.</v>

14
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.920
<v Speaker 1>I would say in a nutshell,</v>

15
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.660
<v Speaker 1>that's a postmodern is theory.</v>

16
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.140
<v Speaker 1>Now that's tainted to some degree with Marxist preconceptions,</v>

17
00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:50.280
<v Speaker 1>but we won't get into that.</v>

18
00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:53.880
<v Speaker 1>But that's basically the idea and it's an idea with a certain amount of</v>

19
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.470
<v Speaker 1>justification.</v>

20
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.980
<v Speaker 1>There is a very large number of ways of interpreting the world and it isn't</v>

21
00:00:58.981 --> 00:01:03.981
<v Speaker 1>obvious which way or ways are right or why they're right.</v>

22
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.630
<v Speaker 1>So it's a complicated problem.</v>

23
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.830
<v Speaker 1>And so I was curious,</v>

24
00:01:07.831 --> 00:01:08.430
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

25
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.340
<v Speaker 1>was this merely a difference of opinion?</v>

26
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.850
<v Speaker 1>The West had a certain set of axioms that it was acting out in the world and the</v>

27
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.820
<v Speaker 1>Soviet bloc and the rest of the communist countries had another set of axioms</v>

28
00:01:20.821 --> 00:01:25.821
<v Speaker 1>and they were both arbitrary and it was a matter of power or was there something</v>

29
00:01:27.121 --> 00:01:28.200
<v Speaker 1>deeper at stake?</v>

30
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.760
<v Speaker 1>So that was question number two.</v>

31
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.260
<v Speaker 1>Question number three was</v>

32
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.730
<v Speaker 1>was there an alternative to brutal combat?</v>

33
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.190
<v Speaker 1>Was there an alternative way of solving the dispute too brutal group combat,</v>

34
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.300
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

35
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.100
<v Speaker 1>And so cause I always believed that if you understood the problem that you could</v>

36
00:01:50.101 --> 00:01:50.910
<v Speaker 1>solve it.</v>

37
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.220
<v Speaker 1>In fact that if,</v>

38
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.240
<v Speaker 1>if when you analyze the problem,</v>

39
00:01:54.241 --> 00:01:56.430
<v Speaker 1>a solution didn't emerge from the analysis,</v>

40
00:01:56.431 --> 00:01:58.830
<v Speaker 1>then you actually didn't understand the problem.</v>

41
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.200
<v Speaker 1>And so I thought if I</v>

42
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.920
<v Speaker 1>delved into the problem deeply enough,</v>

43
00:02:04.921 --> 00:02:07.850
<v Speaker 1>then maybe I could figure out what might constitute a solution.</v>

44
00:02:07.851 --> 00:02:10.940
<v Speaker 1>And assuming there was such a thing because I couldn't,</v>

45
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.700
<v Speaker 1>I knew after writing a fair bit of it that we were,</v>

46
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.320
<v Speaker 1>that there was a real problem because</v>

47
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.850
<v Speaker 1>you can get belief systems that are locked in combat and then obviously the</v>

48
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.710
<v Speaker 1>terrible consequence of that is the combat.</v>

49
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.750
<v Speaker 1>But then I also knew,</v>

50
00:02:27.751 --> 00:02:30.360
<v Speaker 1>and this was probably more from reading nature than anything else,</v>

51
00:02:30.361 --> 00:02:32.520
<v Speaker 1>that if your belief system collapses,</v>

52
00:02:32.521 --> 00:02:32.941
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

53
00:02:32.941 --> 00:02:33.121
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

54
00:02:33.121 --> 00:02:37.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to fight with you about whose belief system is correct.</v>

55
00:02:37.051 --> 00:02:39.060
<v Speaker 1>I'll just let my mind go.</v>

56
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.790
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is if you let your belief system go,</v>

57
00:02:41.791 --> 00:02:45.950
<v Speaker 1>then you're swamped by nihilism and hopelessness and,</v>

58
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.370
<v Speaker 1>and that's not helpful.</v>

59
00:02:47.371 --> 00:02:47.851
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

60
00:02:47.851 --> 00:02:48.450
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

61
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.300
<v Speaker 1>it's not helpful psychologically because it produces emotional pain and anxiety</v>

62
00:02:53.301 --> 00:02:56.880
<v Speaker 1>and maybe at unbearable levels you can't have a pointless life.</v>

63
00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:57.460
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

64
00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.810
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

65
00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:58.290
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

66
00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.340
<v Speaker 1>it's a suffering,</v>

67
00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.210
<v Speaker 1>a pointless life is pointless suffering and people can't sustain that without</v>

68
00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:06.400
<v Speaker 1>becoming demoralized.</v>

69
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.380
<v Speaker 1>That's only where they start demoralized,</v>

70
00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:08.861
<v Speaker 1>bitter,</v>

71
00:03:08.861 --> 00:03:09.371
<v Speaker 1>cruel,</v>

72
00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:10.204
<v Speaker 1>resentful,</v>

73
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.961
<v Speaker 1>angry,</v>

74
00:03:10.961 --> 00:03:11.711
<v Speaker 1>hostile,</v>

75
00:03:11.711 --> 00:03:12.371
<v Speaker 1>murderous,</v>

76
00:03:12.371 --> 00:03:13.181
<v Speaker 1>genocidal.</v>

77
00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:16.150
<v Speaker 1>Like all those things follow one from another if,</v>

78
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.190
<v Speaker 1>if things are sufficiently hopeless.</v>

79
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.590
<v Speaker 1>So you can't just let your belief system go,</v>

80
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.180
<v Speaker 1>but if you're locked into it and there's another one that you're competing with,</v>

81
00:03:25.181 --> 00:03:26.040
<v Speaker 1>then the,</v>

82
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.420
<v Speaker 1>the consequences war.</v>

83
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.841
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

84
00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:32.410
<v Speaker 1>so what is it nihilism on the one hand and war on the other that didn't seem</v>

85
00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:33.130
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

86
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.580
<v Speaker 1>especially given outcome of like say it the Third World War,</v>

87
00:03:36.581 --> 00:03:40.120
<v Speaker 1>that neither of those seemed like acceptable alternatives,</v>

88
00:03:40.121 --> 00:03:41.500
<v Speaker 1>but I couldn't see any other,</v>

89
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.970
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't see that there was anything else other than those two alternatives.</v>

90
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.050
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what I tried to lay out in this book.</v>

91
00:03:50.051 --> 00:03:54.010
<v Speaker 1>Maps of meaning most of the thoughts that I expressed in 12 rules for life,</v>

92
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.023
<v Speaker 1>not all of them,</v>

93
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.210
<v Speaker 1>and in the lectures that I've done that have become popular on Youtube,</v>

94
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.410
<v Speaker 1>were all developed during the 15 year period that I worked on that book and I</v>

95
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.273
<v Speaker 1>worked on it.</v>

96
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.100
<v Speaker 1>I would say obsessively really.</v>

97
00:04:06.101 --> 00:04:11.101
<v Speaker 1>I wrote about three hours a day and I thought about it for pretty much 12 other</v>

98
00:04:11.891 --> 00:04:12.724
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>

99
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.070
<v Speaker 1>And so I was thinking constantly.</v>

100
00:04:15.071 --> 00:04:15.700
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

101
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.200
<v Speaker 1>it's not an obvious why,</v>

102
00:04:17.201 --> 00:04:17.560
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

103
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.771
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

104
00:04:17.771 --> 00:04:22.330
<v Speaker 1>I told you why for some reason all that manifested itself to me as a cardinal</v>

105
00:04:22.331 --> 00:04:23.164
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>

106
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.530
<v Speaker 1>but I concluded and tried to lay out the rationale for this,</v>

107
00:04:29.531 --> 00:04:30.364
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

108
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.273
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

109
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.930
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

110
00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.590
<v Speaker 1>the fight between these two belief systems,</v>

111
00:04:35.591 --> 00:04:36.191
<v Speaker 1>but let's,</v>

112
00:04:36.191 --> 00:04:37.450
<v Speaker 1>let's look at the belief systems.</v>

113
00:04:37.451 --> 00:04:39.340
<v Speaker 1>It's not communism versus the West.</v>

114
00:04:39.341 --> 00:04:41.380
<v Speaker 1>It's not communism versus the free market.</v>

115
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:41.910
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

116
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:42.760
<v Speaker 1>it's different than that.</v>

117
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.600
<v Speaker 1>It's collectivism in it's far right form,</v>

118
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.250
<v Speaker 1>let's say the far right form of the Nazis and the far left form of the radical</v>

119
00:04:51.251 --> 00:04:51.751
<v Speaker 1>leftist,</v>

120
00:04:51.751 --> 00:04:55.870
<v Speaker 1>the communists that's collectivism versus individualism.</v>

121
00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.390
<v Speaker 1>That's the fundamental conflict.</v>

122
00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.080
<v Speaker 1>And there are variants of the collectivist viewpoint,</v>

123
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.870
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter.</v>

124
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.120
<v Speaker 1>They can be grouped under the rubric of Collectivism.</v>

125
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.560
<v Speaker 1>There's important differences,</v>

126
00:05:05.561 --> 00:05:06.730
<v Speaker 1>but we don't have to get into that.</v>

127
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.580
<v Speaker 1>But the western take wasn't collectivist.</v>

128
00:05:09.581 --> 00:05:14.581
<v Speaker 1>It was individualist and the central idea of the West was that although people</v>

129
00:05:15.191 --> 00:05:20.191
<v Speaker 1>are obviously obviously aggregate into groups and many different groups,</v>

130
00:05:20.801 --> 00:05:24.190
<v Speaker 1>cause all of you are members of very of many different groups,</v>

131
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.203
<v Speaker 1>ethnicities,</v>

132
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.110
<v Speaker 1>genders,</v>

133
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.890
<v Speaker 1>sexes,</v>

134
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:27.723
<v Speaker 1>races,</v>

135
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:28.720
<v Speaker 1>family groups,</v>

136
00:05:28.721 --> 00:05:29.740
<v Speaker 1>community groups.</v>

137
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.290
<v Speaker 1>You can be grouped a very large number of ways and you tend towards the adoption</v>

138
00:05:35.291 --> 00:05:38.230
<v Speaker 1>of something approximating a group identity because you know,</v>

139
00:05:38.231 --> 00:05:41.920
<v Speaker 1>you take care of your family and you're a member of your community and you have</v>

140
00:05:41.921 --> 00:05:46.420
<v Speaker 1>a certain amount of justifiable patriotism in relationship to your state.</v>

141
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.180
<v Speaker 1>The group identity is definitely part of who you are.</v>

142
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:55.380
<v Speaker 1>The question is what the fundamental defining characteristic of who you are and</v>

143
00:05:56.201 --> 00:06:01.201
<v Speaker 1>the collectivists is that you are the Avatar of a collective.</v>

144
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.460
<v Speaker 1>And that's fundamentally who you are.</v>

145
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:06.770
<v Speaker 1>But the western perspective is not that.</v>

146
00:06:06.771 --> 00:06:11.390
<v Speaker 1>The Western perspective is that despite the fact that people have an individual</v>

147
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.280
<v Speaker 1>level and a collective level,</v>

148
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.970
<v Speaker 1>the individual level is to be regarded as paramount.</v>

149
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:21.710
<v Speaker 1>You're to be treated above all else above all as an individual.</v>

150
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:23.443
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

151
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.870
<v Speaker 1>and I looked into that very deeply and I thought that isn't arbitrary.</v>

152
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.150
<v Speaker 1>It's actually correct.</v>

153
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:31.820
<v Speaker 1>That's the right way of looking at the world.</v>

154
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.171
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>

155
00:06:33.171 --> 00:06:33.321
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

156
00:06:33.321 --> 00:06:34.760
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean the right way?</v>

157
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.120
<v Speaker 1>And of course that's the right question because that is the question.</v>

158
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.880
<v Speaker 1>If something's the right way of looking at something,</v>

159
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.370
<v Speaker 1>well why is it the right way of looking at it?</v>

160
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:49.300
<v Speaker 1>But I want to put a little spin on that too because usually when we talk about</v>

161
00:06:49.461 --> 00:06:50.960
<v Speaker 1>individualism in the West,</v>

162
00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.210
<v Speaker 1>at least in the modern world,</v>

163
00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:56.750
<v Speaker 1>maybe let's say for the last 50 years or something like that,</v>

164
00:06:56.751 --> 00:06:58.190
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's after World War II,</v>

165
00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly the parameters.</v>

166
00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.321
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

167
00:07:00.321 --> 00:07:05.321
<v Speaker 1>Certainly since the 1960s when we think about the tradition of individuality in</v>

168
00:07:05.331 --> 00:07:06.110
<v Speaker 1>the west,</v>

169
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:11.030
<v Speaker 1>we think about the tradition of individual rights and there's a problem with</v>

170
00:07:11.031 --> 00:07:11.864
<v Speaker 1>that because</v>

171
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:18.610
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental individual tradition of the West is not individual rights and</v>

172
00:07:19.071 --> 00:07:20.390
<v Speaker 1>rights have a problem.</v>

173
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.080
<v Speaker 1>Rights are sort of like you're privileged compared to other people.</v>

174
00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:29.140
<v Speaker 1>I have these rights and don't tread on them that that wall's me off and makes me</v>

175
00:07:30.981 --> 00:07:33.260
<v Speaker 1>privileged in some sense.</v>

176
00:07:33.261 --> 00:07:35.500
<v Speaker 1>It means that I have the right to do things.</v>

177
00:07:35.501 --> 00:07:37.910
<v Speaker 1>I have the right to pursue my own interests.</v>

178
00:07:37.911 --> 00:07:39.950
<v Speaker 1>I have the right to pursue happiness,</v>

179
00:07:39.951 --> 00:07:40.784
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

180
00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:43.580
<v Speaker 1>that's explicitly laid out in the American system.</v>

181
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:46.880
<v Speaker 1>The rights or what is special about me?</v>

182
00:07:46.881 --> 00:07:50.870
<v Speaker 1>And so when you look at individuality or individualism from that perspective,</v>

183
00:07:50.871 --> 00:07:53.780
<v Speaker 1>you can think about it as a selfish idea.</v>

184
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:58.460
<v Speaker 1>And it's often criticized by collectivists precisely for that selfishness.</v>

185
00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:02.720
<v Speaker 1>But the fundamental idea of the individual in the West isn't predicated on</v>

186
00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:03.733
<v Speaker 1>rights.</v>

187
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:04.970
<v Speaker 1>Even though that's important,</v>

188
00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.520
<v Speaker 1>it's predicated on responsibility,</v>

189
00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:08.991
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

190
00:08:08.991 --> 00:08:13.991
<v Speaker 1>So your role as an individual in the West isn't to be the bearer of rights of</v>

191
00:08:16.251 --> 00:08:17.330
<v Speaker 1>intrinsic rights.</v>

192
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:18.770
<v Speaker 1>Even though those are important,</v>

193
00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:24.730
<v Speaker 1>your responsibility as an individual in the west is to bear the responsibility</v>

194
00:08:25.371 --> 00:08:26.240
<v Speaker 1>of an individual.</v>

195
00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:31.700
<v Speaker 1>And it's in bearing that responsibility that you set yourself,</v>

196
00:08:31.701 --> 00:08:32.061
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

197
00:08:32.061 --> 00:08:32.811
<v Speaker 1>and your family,</v>

198
00:08:32.811 --> 00:08:33.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

199
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.480
<v Speaker 1>And You keep the state on track.</v>

200
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:37.940
<v Speaker 1>It's not from expressing your rights,</v>

201
00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:40.970
<v Speaker 1>it's from shouldering your responsibility.</v>

202
00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:46.390
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that the reason that you have rights in the West is so that you</v>

203
00:08:46.911 --> 00:08:48.710
<v Speaker 1>can shoulder your responsibility.</v>

204
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:50.330
<v Speaker 1>It's not the other way around.</v>

205
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:55.070
<v Speaker 1>It's so that you can do what's best on your behalf and in that manner,</v>

206
00:08:55.230 --> 00:09:00.090
<v Speaker 1>what's best on your family's behalf and in that manner contribute to the degree</v>

207
00:09:00.091 --> 00:09:02.010
<v Speaker 1>that you can to the community.</v>

208
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.040
<v Speaker 1>And that if you do all those things simultaneously,</v>

209
00:09:05.041 --> 00:09:07.980
<v Speaker 1>which means to accept the responsibility for that,</v>

210
00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:12.990
<v Speaker 1>then things move ahead as well as they can move ahead,</v>

211
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:18.260
<v Speaker 1>which doesn't necessarily mean well because life is very difficult and there's</v>

212
00:09:18.331 --> 00:09:20.610
<v Speaker 1>no sure way through it.</v>

213
00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:25.020
<v Speaker 1>There's only less bad approaches.</v>

214
00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:26.760
<v Speaker 1>That might be a way of thinking about it,</v>

215
00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:32.090
<v Speaker 1>and the least bad approach you can manage is to shoulder your responsibility as</v>

216
00:09:33.001 --> 00:09:33.780
<v Speaker 1>an individual.</v>
