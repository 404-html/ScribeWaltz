1
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.820
<v Speaker 1>How can a very,</v>

2
00:00:08.821 --> 00:00:09.631
<v Speaker 1>very interesting issue.</v>

3
00:00:09.631 --> 00:00:11.030
<v Speaker 1>So this try and pick a couple of,</v>

4
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.113
<v Speaker 1>but the fact</v>

5
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.730
<v Speaker 1>it's evident to me,</v>

6
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.150
<v Speaker 1>and I'm enormously encouraged by this because I'm a passionate of Australia and</v>

7
00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:22.230
<v Speaker 1>I'd want this country to be the sort of place that offers opportunities of the</v>

8
00:00:22.231 --> 00:00:23.670
<v Speaker 1>salt that I had when I was young.</v>

9
00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.630
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

10
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.740
<v Speaker 1>I've had my opportunities,</v>

11
00:00:25.741 --> 00:00:27.360
<v Speaker 1>but I look at my kids' generation,</v>

12
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.870
<v Speaker 1>what's going to be there for them if we keep feeding the sort of scene grew in</v>

13
00:00:34.231 --> 00:00:35.064
<v Speaker 1>reality,</v>

14
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.410
<v Speaker 1>the people turning out in vast numbers.</v>

15
00:00:37.411 --> 00:00:41.160
<v Speaker 1>Every one of your talks in Australia's been oversubscribed massively.</v>

16
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.700
<v Speaker 1>It tells you that kind of get those more to this new way of being tall.</v>

17
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.980
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

18
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:48.340
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

19
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.100
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the things that's so interesting about dealing with archetypal</v>

20
00:00:51.101 --> 00:00:55.720
<v Speaker 2>themes know architectural themes are archetypal because they actually speak of</v>

21
00:00:55.721 --> 00:00:57.610
<v Speaker 2>the structure of human experience.</v>

22
00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.110
<v Speaker 2>That's why they last.</v>

23
00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.460
<v Speaker 2>And so it's human nature and human experience has a pattern.</v>

24
00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.990
<v Speaker 2>You don't have the capacity to do articulate that pattern as an individual in</v>

25
00:01:07.991 --> 00:01:09.490
<v Speaker 2>part because your life is too short.</v>

26
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.080
<v Speaker 2>You just can't figure it out.</v>

27
00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:12.270
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

28
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.630
<v Speaker 2>the ancient representations of those patterns are everywhere around you and you,</v>

29
00:01:16.631 --> 00:01:17.081
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

30
00:01:17.081 --> 00:01:18.070
<v Speaker 2>some of them at the image,</v>

31
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.590
<v Speaker 2>you caught on to them automatically you,</v>

32
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.960
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

33
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:21.761
<v Speaker 2>you fall into them.</v>

34
00:01:21.761 --> 00:01:23.170
<v Speaker 2>If you go to a movie for example,</v>

35
00:01:23.171 --> 00:01:25.240
<v Speaker 2>because movies always express archetipal themes.</v>

36
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.700
<v Speaker 2>If you hear them articulate it,</v>

37
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:28.450
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>

38
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.320
<v Speaker 2>I knew that,</v>

39
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.071
<v Speaker 2>I knew that.</v>

40
00:01:30.071 --> 00:01:31.420
<v Speaker 2>I just didn't know how to say it.</v>

41
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.841
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

42
00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:33.490
<v Speaker 2>that's the platonic idea of,</v>

43
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.091
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

44
00:01:34.091 --> 00:01:34.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

45
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.080
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

46
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.850
<v Speaker 2>of learning as remembering your,</v>

47
00:01:36.851 --> 00:01:38.350
<v Speaker 2>your soul already knows,</v>

48
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.150
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't have the words.</v>

49
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.160
<v Speaker 2>And so when people talk to me about watching my lectures,</v>

50
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.020
<v Speaker 2>let's say they say,</v>

51
00:01:47.021 --> 00:01:48.670
<v Speaker 2>they basically say one of two things.</v>

52
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.840
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

53
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.240
<v Speaker 2>if it,</v>

54
00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.830
<v Speaker 2>if it's not just a simple thank you.</v>

55
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.150
<v Speaker 2>They say one of two things.</v>

56
00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:53.620
<v Speaker 2>A third of them say,</v>

57
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.120
<v Speaker 2>quarter of them say,</v>

58
00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.160
<v Speaker 2>when I listen to you talk,</v>

59
00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.010
<v Speaker 2>it's as if you're telling me things that I already know.</v>

60
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:01.001
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

61
00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:01.151
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

62
00:02:01.151 --> 00:02:04.390
<v Speaker 2>well that's exactly right because that's what archetipal stories are there.</v>

63
00:02:04.391 --> 00:02:06.130
<v Speaker 2>The description of what you already know,</v>

64
00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.290
<v Speaker 2>but that can be articulated.</v>

65
00:02:08.291 --> 00:02:13.000
<v Speaker 2>And then who you are and how you see yourself and the way you described yourself</v>

66
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.890
<v Speaker 2>all become the same thing.</v>

67
00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.060
<v Speaker 2>So that's wonderful.</v>

68
00:02:16.061 --> 00:02:17.530
<v Speaker 2>Then you're not at odds with yourself,</v>

69
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

70
00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:18.760
<v Speaker 2>and then you have,</v>

71
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.580
<v Speaker 2>then you're a functioning unity and that makes you much stronger and more</v>

72
00:02:21.581 --> 00:02:23.110
<v Speaker 2>indomitable than you would otherwise be.</v>

73
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.030
<v Speaker 2>And then the other thing that people say,</v>

74
00:02:25.031 --> 00:02:26.680
<v Speaker 2>and this is more like three quarters of them,</v>

75
00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.450
<v Speaker 2>is that they say,</v>

76
00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.310
<v Speaker 2>I was in a very dark place.</v>

77
00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.091
<v Speaker 2>I was addicted,</v>

78
00:02:31.091 --> 00:02:31.570
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

79
00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:32.800
<v Speaker 2>I was drinking too much.</v>

80
00:02:32.801 --> 00:02:33.700
<v Speaker 2>I had a fragment,</v>

81
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.850
<v Speaker 2>did relationship with my fiance and I wasn't getting married.</v>

82
00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.331
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

83
00:02:37.331 --> 00:02:39.280
<v Speaker 2>things weren't going very well with my family.</v>

84
00:02:39.281 --> 00:02:41.320
<v Speaker 2>My relationship with my father was damaged.</v>

85
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.760
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have any AME.</v>

86
00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.140
<v Speaker 2>I was wasting my time.</v>

87
00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.460
<v Speaker 2>Some variant of that,</v>

88
00:02:45.461 --> 00:02:46.960
<v Speaker 2>some combination of those.</v>

89
00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.190
<v Speaker 2>And they say,</v>

90
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.023
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

91
00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.430
<v Speaker 2>I've been watching your lectures.</v>

92
00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.620
<v Speaker 2>I've decided to establish a purpose.</v>

93
00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to tell the truth and things are way better.</v>

94
00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:58.300
<v Speaker 2>And I've,</v>

95
00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.710
<v Speaker 2>and so let's say I've done maybe eight or nine large scale public talks in the</v>

96
00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:03.431
<v Speaker 2>last two months.</v>

97
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:05.590
<v Speaker 2>So that's probably 20,000 people.</v>

98
00:03:05.591 --> 00:03:07.210
<v Speaker 2>And about half of them,</v>

99
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.520
<v Speaker 2>a third to half of the misstate afterwards to talk to me.</v>

100
00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:12.370
<v Speaker 2>So that's about 7,000 people who have said that to me.</v>

101
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.680
<v Speaker 2>And then people stop me on the street all the time.</v>

102
00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:16.180
<v Speaker 2>And tell me exactly that story,</v>

103
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:17.380
<v Speaker 2>which is just wonderful.</v>

104
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.280
<v Speaker 2>Like you can't imagine how good it is to be able to go to places you've never</v>

105
00:03:21.281 --> 00:03:22.090
<v Speaker 2>been.</v>

106
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.150
<v Speaker 2>And to have people start people on the streets spontaneously and say,</v>

107
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.990
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

108
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.940
<v Speaker 2>my life is way better than it was.</v>

109
00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:28.774
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

110
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:29.890
<v Speaker 2>it's so good.</v>

111
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.910
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

112
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:31.780
<v Speaker 2>and I've got like,</v>

113
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

114
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.320
<v Speaker 2>35,000 letters from people since last August.</v>

115
00:03:35.321 --> 00:03:36.041
<v Speaker 2>It's more than that.</v>

116
00:03:36.041 --> 00:03:37.060
<v Speaker 2>I can't keep track of them.</v>

117
00:03:37.061 --> 00:03:38.470
<v Speaker 2>And it's exactly the same thing,</v>

118
00:03:38.471 --> 00:03:39.304
<v Speaker 2>like three quarters,</v>

119
00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:40.510
<v Speaker 2>quarter of them say,</v>

120
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.931
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

121
00:03:40.931 --> 00:03:43.450
<v Speaker 2>you've given me the words to say what I already knew it was true.</v>

122
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.710
<v Speaker 2>And thank you for that.</v>

123
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.150
<v Speaker 2>I can see that in the audience.</v>

124
00:03:46.151 --> 00:03:48.670
<v Speaker 2>It's so interesting because I can lay out a story.</v>

125
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.220
<v Speaker 2>People go like this and say they're doing that all the time.</v>

126
00:03:51.221 --> 00:03:52.630
<v Speaker 2>It's like the lights are going on.</v>

127
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.590
<v Speaker 2>And that's a really,</v>

128
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:54.440
<v Speaker 2>while there's no,</v>

129
00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.520
<v Speaker 2>almost nothing better than that to watch lights go on when you're talking to</v>

130
00:03:57.521 --> 00:03:57.851
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

131
00:03:57.851 --> 00:04:00.610
<v Speaker 2>it's like that's just absolutely fantastic.</v>

132
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.400
<v Speaker 2>But to get this response from people,</v>

133
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.293
<v Speaker 2>my father,</v>

134
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.920
<v Speaker 2>I have my father's about 80,</v>

135
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:07.990
<v Speaker 2>80 is 83,</v>

136
00:04:07.991 --> 00:04:10.930
<v Speaker 2>I think 81 he's 81.</v>

137
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.130
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

138
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.170
<v Speaker 2>I put it in charge of,</v>

139
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.310
<v Speaker 2>of going through my viewer email,</v>

140
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:16.283
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

141
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:17.860
<v Speaker 2>which is an overwhelming job.</v>

142
00:04:17.861 --> 00:04:19.040
<v Speaker 2>But now he,</v>

143
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.800
<v Speaker 2>we've had discussions about this constantly.</v>

144
00:04:20.801 --> 00:04:24.760
<v Speaker 2>He's overwhelmed by the fact that so many people are writing and saying the same</v>

145
00:04:24.761 --> 00:04:25.061
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

146
00:04:25.061 --> 00:04:25.421
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

147
00:04:25.421 --> 00:04:26.254
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

148
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.260
<v Speaker 2>I have a purpose in my life actually matters.</v>

149
00:04:29.261 --> 00:04:32.860
<v Speaker 2>I finally realized that and I'm putting it into practice and I'm bearing up</v>

150
00:04:32.861 --> 00:04:34.570
<v Speaker 2>under the heaviest load I can imagine.</v>

151
00:04:34.571 --> 00:04:36.130
<v Speaker 2>And it's really helping.</v>

152
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.143
<v Speaker 2>It's like God,</v>

153
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.270
<v Speaker 2>and that's tens of thousands of responses now.</v>

154
00:04:40.271 --> 00:04:41.230
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

155
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.400
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

156
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.360
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't hope for anything better than that.</v>

157
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:47.920
<v Speaker 2>There's zero harm in it,</v>

158
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:48.161
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

159
00:04:48.161 --> 00:04:49.840
<v Speaker 2>It's just people putting their lives together,</v>

160
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.770
<v Speaker 2>they're not mucking about with other people and are trying to make broad scale</v>

161
00:04:53.771 --> 00:04:56.380
<v Speaker 2>social transformations about which they have no idea.</v>

162
00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.000
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to make their immediate environment better and it's working.</v>

163
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.050
<v Speaker 2>It's like great,</v>

164
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:03.593
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

165
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.190
<v Speaker 2>You say the zero harm in it.</v>

166
00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.790
<v Speaker 2>I would say as a former legislator that there's an enormous amount of good in a</v>

167
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.581
<v Speaker 2>country is only,</v>

168
00:05:09.581 --> 00:05:11.100
<v Speaker 2>there's some title of the people would make it.</v>

169
00:05:11.101 --> 00:05:11.860
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

170
00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.110
<v Speaker 2>to the extent that they put together resilient,</v>

171
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.220
<v Speaker 2>I would only contribute,</v>

172
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.460
<v Speaker 2>don't have to ask others to help them.</v>

173
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.590
<v Speaker 2>The stronger the nation.</v>

174
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.820
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

175
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.110
<v Speaker 2>And rapidly like,</v>

176
00:05:23.111 --> 00:05:25.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think I was thinking the other day some,</v>

177
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.610
<v Speaker 2>a journalist asked me why the audience,</v>

178
00:05:27.611 --> 00:05:30.280
<v Speaker 2>why people are responding so positively to what I'm saying,</v>

179
00:05:30.281 --> 00:05:31.420
<v Speaker 2>the young men for example.</v>

180
00:05:31.421 --> 00:05:32.254
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>

181
00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:32.680
<v Speaker 2>hmm,</v>

182
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.870
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>

183
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:33.131
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

184
00:05:33.131 --> 00:05:33.341
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

185
00:05:33.341 --> 00:05:34.180
<v Speaker 2>that's a good question.</v>

186
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.781
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

187
00:05:34.781 --> 00:05:36.610
<v Speaker 2>well I'm actually on their side.</v>

188
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty happy that I'm really happy that they're not wasting their lives.</v>

189
00:05:41.891 --> 00:05:46.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm really sad to see that people are disenchanted and nihilistic and depressed</v>

190
00:05:46.031 --> 00:05:47.570
<v Speaker 2>and anxious and aimless and,</v>

191
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.690
<v Speaker 2>and perverse and vengeful and,</v>

192
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:50.860
<v Speaker 2>and all of those things.</v>

193
00:05:50.861 --> 00:05:51.671
<v Speaker 2>It's terrible.</v>

194
00:05:51.671 --> 00:05:56.671
<v Speaker 2>And then to see people question whether that's necessary and then to start to</v>

195
00:05:57.111 --> 00:05:57.861
<v Speaker 2>rise out of it,</v>

196
00:05:57.861 --> 00:05:58.520
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

197
00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.211
<v Speaker 2>it's so fun.</v>

198
00:05:59.211 --> 00:06:02.150
<v Speaker 2>Like last night I was at after my talk.</v>

199
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:03.103
<v Speaker 2>It's overwhelming.</v>

200
00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.313
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

201
00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't usually think about these things,</v>

202
00:06:09.971 --> 00:06:10.661
<v Speaker 2>but I was,</v>

203
00:06:10.661 --> 00:06:12.090
<v Speaker 2>I was after my talk last night,</v>

204
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.311
<v Speaker 2>didn't.</v>

205
00:06:12.311 --> 00:06:14.170
<v Speaker 2>So all these people line up and you know,</v>

206
00:06:14.171 --> 00:06:17.680
<v Speaker 2>they have their fifteens 15 seconds with me and they're kind of tentative.</v>

207
00:06:17.681 --> 00:06:20.200
<v Speaker 2>They're excited and attentive when they come up to talk to me and then they</v>

208
00:06:20.201 --> 00:06:20.470
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>

209
00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:20.741
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

210
00:06:20.741 --> 00:06:22.510
<v Speaker 2>15 seconds of time to tell me something.</v>

211
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm really listening to them and they're hesitant about whether or not to share</v>

212
00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.480
<v Speaker 2>the good news about their life.</v>

213
00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:28.721
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

214
00:06:28.721 --> 00:06:30.370
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's often because,</v>

215
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:31.870
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

216
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.510
<v Speaker 2>when people share good news about their life,</v>

217
00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.260
<v Speaker 2>people don't necessarily respond positively.</v>

218
00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:39.101
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

219
00:06:39.101 --> 00:06:43.360
<v Speaker 2>they don't get encouragement and people need so little encouragement.</v>

220
00:06:43.361 --> 00:06:44.920
<v Speaker 2>It's just unbelievable.</v>

221
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:46.980
<v Speaker 2>And so they'll tell me something good and nothing,</v>

222
00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:47.321
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

223
00:06:47.321 --> 00:06:47.951
<v Speaker 2>that's so good.</v>

224
00:06:47.951 --> 00:06:48.221
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

225
00:06:48.221 --> 00:06:48.900
<v Speaker 2>somebody says,</v>

226
00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:49.300
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

227
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:50.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting along way better with my father.</v>

228
00:06:50.921 --> 00:06:53.020
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen him for 10 years and now we get along.</v>

229
00:06:53.021 --> 00:06:54.970
<v Speaker 2>It's like crate.</v>

230
00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:55.571
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>

231
00:06:55.571 --> 00:06:55.990
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

232
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.890
<v Speaker 2>the power of that,</v>

233
00:06:56.891 --> 00:07:01.270
<v Speaker 2>you can't overstate the power of that for individuals to get their life</v>

234
00:07:01.271 --> 00:07:01.631
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

235
00:07:01.631 --> 00:07:04.600
<v Speaker 2>They individuals an unbelievably powerful force.</v>

236
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.560
<v Speaker 2>And every single person who gets their act together a little bit has the</v>

237
00:07:08.561 --> 00:07:10.510
<v Speaker 2>capacity to spread that around them.</v>

238
00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:11.613
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

239
00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.030
<v Speaker 2>it's a chain reaction.</v>

240
00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.990
<v Speaker 2>And so it's a lovely thing to see and that's fantastic.</v>
