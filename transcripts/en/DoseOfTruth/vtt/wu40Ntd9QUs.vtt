00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.500
<v Speaker 1>How do you define reality?</v>

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.110
<v Speaker 1>That's a tough one.</v>

3
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.770
<v Speaker 1>So I would say most of you define reality like you're Isaac Newton or maybe like</v>

4
00:00:10.681 --> 00:00:14.670
<v Speaker 1>your Democritus who was the first person who hypothesized Adams.</v>

5
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.770
<v Speaker 1>And so in the Newtonian world,</v>

6
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.360
<v Speaker 1>it's like billiard ball world,</v>

7
00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:19.110
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

8
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.740
<v Speaker 1>Everything is made out of little billiard balls and they bang together in a</v>

9
00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:26.190
<v Speaker 1>causal way and you can predict the consequences of their banging together.</v>

10
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.690
<v Speaker 1>And if you extend it enough,</v>

11
00:00:27.691 --> 00:00:30.510
<v Speaker 1>you can conjure up an entirely deterministic world.</v>

12
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.300
<v Speaker 1>A happens causes B,</v>

13
00:00:32.301 --> 00:00:37.301
<v Speaker 1>B causes c always the same way and everything runs like a giant clock.</v>

14
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.150
<v Speaker 1>That's Newton's model.</v>

15
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.620
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

16
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.430
<v Speaker 1>and it was a clock model because you know,</v>

17
00:00:41.431 --> 00:00:42.270
<v Speaker 1>back at that time,</v>

18
00:00:42.271 --> 00:00:42.781
<v Speaker 1>clocks,</v>

19
00:00:42.781 --> 00:00:43.051
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

20
00:00:43.051 --> 00:00:44.850
<v Speaker 1>those things were pretty damn impressive.</v>

21
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.360
<v Speaker 1>Clocks got the whole industrial revolution underway and you know,</v>

22
00:00:48.361 --> 00:00:52.140
<v Speaker 1>medieval cities would put an awful lot of time and work into their clocks and</v>

23
00:00:52.141 --> 00:00:54.210
<v Speaker 1>they thought those damn things were really cool.</v>

24
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.690
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

25
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.180
<v Speaker 1>they could keep track of where the planets were moving.</v>

26
00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.370
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's a big deal at Clark.</v>

27
00:00:59.371 --> 00:01:02.040
<v Speaker 1>And then if you want to think about an invention that changed the world,</v>

28
00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:03.630
<v Speaker 1>it's like the clock's a big one.</v>

29
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.660
<v Speaker 1>Now we can measure time in the same way.</v>

30
00:01:06.661 --> 00:01:08.100
<v Speaker 1>Everyone can measure time.</v>

31
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.270
<v Speaker 1>It's a big deal.</v>

32
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.700
<v Speaker 1>So the idea that the universe is like a clock,</v>

33
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.850
<v Speaker 1>given that the clock can predict the universe,</v>

34
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.710
<v Speaker 1>it's a pretty damn powerful idea.</v>

35
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.770
<v Speaker 1>It turns out that it's wrong because you know,</v>

36
00:01:19.771 --> 00:01:21.060
<v Speaker 1>causalities a mass,</v>

37
00:01:21.061 --> 00:01:22.350
<v Speaker 1>no one really understands it.</v>

38
00:01:22.351 --> 00:01:26.280
<v Speaker 1>And there are levels of analysis that which causality just in the way we</v>

39
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.830
<v Speaker 1>experience it doesn't seem to imply it apply at all.</v>

40
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.720
<v Speaker 1>You go down to the subatomic level,</v>

41
00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:31.800
<v Speaker 1>it's probabilistic.</v>

42
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.750
<v Speaker 1>You can't predict single events.</v>

43
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.180
<v Speaker 1>And I don't believe that you can predict the future.</v>

44
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.990
<v Speaker 1>You can predict parts of the future in an extremely limited way for some</v>

45
00:01:39.991 --> 00:01:40.710
<v Speaker 1>purposes,</v>

46
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.170
<v Speaker 1>for some span of time that,</v>

47
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.380
<v Speaker 1>and you can't even predict how long that span of time is going to last.</v>

48
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:47.051
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

49
00:01:47.051 --> 00:01:51.540
<v Speaker 1>And some things seem to be more stable across more situations and more times</v>

50
00:01:51.541 --> 00:01:52.374
<v Speaker 1>than others,</v>

51
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.610
<v Speaker 1>but there's still,</v>

52
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.940
<v Speaker 1>there's instability everywhere and it makes it predicting things a very</v>

53
00:01:56.941 --> 00:01:58.080
<v Speaker 1>difficult thing to do.</v>

54
00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:59.610
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

55
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.180
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

56
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.820
<v Speaker 1>so that's one idea about reality.</v>

57
00:02:02.821 --> 00:02:04.050
<v Speaker 1>That's the idea really,</v>

58
00:02:04.051 --> 00:02:04.890
<v Speaker 1>that you have,</v>

59
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.470
<v Speaker 1>and that's the reality that you've been educated to have.</v>
