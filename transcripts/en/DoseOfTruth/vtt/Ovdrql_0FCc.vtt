00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.923
<v Speaker 1>Each year is,</v>

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.000
<v Speaker 1>is very interested in the problem of value.</v>

3
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.810
<v Speaker 1>And the problem of value fundamentally is not the problem of what is the world</v>

4
00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:18.840
<v Speaker 1>made up or even how does the world function,</v>

5
00:00:18.841 --> 00:00:23.700
<v Speaker 1>which are more in some sense more specifically scientific questions.</v>

6
00:00:23.701 --> 00:00:27.120
<v Speaker 1>But how is it that you should conduct yourself in the world?</v>

7
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:28.740
<v Speaker 1>How should you act?</v>

8
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.690
<v Speaker 1>And people act towards aims in a sense,</v>

9
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.170
<v Speaker 1>because we're active creatures and we're moving from one point to another.</v>

10
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.770
<v Speaker 1>We're moving towards things that we want.</v>

11
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.080
<v Speaker 1>And that means that we're guided by our desires and we're not only guided by</v>

12
00:00:46.081 --> 00:00:49.470
<v Speaker 1>desires insofar as we have individual desires,</v>

13
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.860
<v Speaker 1>we're guided by the structure that consists of how those desires are related to</v>

14
00:00:57.361 --> 00:00:58.194
<v Speaker 1>one another.</v>

15
00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:59.820
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

16
00:00:59.821 --> 00:01:01.470
<v Speaker 1>if you have a room full of people,</v>

17
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.350
<v Speaker 1>say a room full of children,</v>

18
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.810
<v Speaker 1>they're active and they're each pursuing their individual desires.</v>

19
00:01:09.811 --> 00:01:13.680
<v Speaker 1>But at some point they may choose to organize themselves into a game.</v>

20
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.590
<v Speaker 1>And if they organize themselves into a game,</v>

21
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.670
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing,</v>

22
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.180
<v Speaker 1>for all intents and purposes is producing a little society,</v>

23
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.620
<v Speaker 1>a little micro society.</v>

24
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.480
<v Speaker 1>And within that micro society,</v>

25
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.490
<v Speaker 1>they're deciding what desires will be currently expressed and how they'll exist</v>

26
00:01:29.491 --> 00:01:30.930
<v Speaker 1>in relationship to one another.</v>

27
00:01:30.931 --> 00:01:35.931
<v Speaker 1>And that means that they can cooperate without too much conflict and that they</v>

28
00:01:36.691 --> 00:01:39.630
<v Speaker 1>can jointly move towards,</v>

29
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:40.620
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

30
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.380
<v Speaker 1>a joint AME without</v>

31
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.990
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

32
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.560
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

33
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.870
<v Speaker 1>and gather all the benefits that might be associated with that.</v>

34
00:01:49.871 --> 00:01:52.350
<v Speaker 1>And that might be the accomplishment of the Ame,</v>

35
00:01:52.351 --> 00:01:52.951
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>

36
00:01:52.951 --> 00:01:56.670
<v Speaker 1>But it also might be just the enjoyment that's to be had in the pursuit of that</v>

37
00:01:56.671 --> 00:01:57.504
<v Speaker 1>activity.</v>

38
00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.760
<v Speaker 1>Now people do that</v>

39
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.950
<v Speaker 1>socially because we have to do that in order to get along with other people</v>

40
00:02:06.951 --> 00:02:10.010
<v Speaker 1>because our designers have to be melded with those of other people.</v>

41
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.200
<v Speaker 1>But we also do it psychologically.</v>

42
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.600
<v Speaker 1>And those two things exist in a dance because as I'm interacting with other</v>

43
00:02:17.601 --> 00:02:18.434
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

44
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.010
<v Speaker 1>the demands of the fact that we're interacting make,</v>

45
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.220
<v Speaker 1>require each of us to arrange our desires in a way that's acceptable to everyone</v>

46
00:02:30.231 --> 00:02:31.064
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

47
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:32.780
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time,</v>

48
00:02:32.781 --> 00:02:33.531
<v Speaker 1>while we're doing that,</v>

49
00:02:33.531 --> 00:02:37.970
<v Speaker 1>we're also observing the process by which those desires are ordered.</v>

50
00:02:37.971 --> 00:02:41.840
<v Speaker 1>And then we internalize that process and use that to order our own desires.</v>

51
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.490
<v Speaker 1>And then so there's a constant</v>

52
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.950
<v Speaker 1>mutually informative dance between the individual and the group.</v>

53
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.030
<v Speaker 1>And the culmination of that is the organization of society and the simultaneous</v>

54
00:02:53.031 --> 00:02:54.440
<v Speaker 1>organization of the psyche.</v>

55
00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.250
<v Speaker 1>And it's that process that needs you is talking in these paragraphs.</v>

56
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.430
<v Speaker 1>Now you might ask yourself,</v>

57
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.721
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

58
00:03:04.721 --> 00:03:09.721
<v Speaker 1>what's the utility of articulating such things and conceptualizing them and</v>

59
00:03:10.091 --> 00:03:10.940
<v Speaker 1>understanding them.</v>

60
00:03:10.941 --> 00:03:14.470
<v Speaker 1>And the answer in some ways,</v>

61
00:03:14.471 --> 00:03:15.460
<v Speaker 1>it's straight forward.</v>

62
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.590
<v Speaker 1>If you don't want to run a foul of the your own desires,</v>

63
00:03:20.591 --> 00:03:21.820
<v Speaker 1>you have to organize them</v>

64
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.890
<v Speaker 1>because some of them are short term and some of them are medium term and some of</v>

65
00:03:26.891 --> 00:03:27.760
<v Speaker 1>them are long term.</v>

66
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.030
<v Speaker 1>And some of the main meant this and some of the main that.</v>

67
00:03:31.031 --> 00:03:36.031
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't necessarily the case that those desires allow for mutual</v>

68
00:03:36.251 --> 00:03:36.881
<v Speaker 1>fulfillment.</v>

69
00:03:36.881 --> 00:03:37.870
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

70
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.010
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're very interested in pursuing a sexual relationship with someone,</v>

71
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.850
<v Speaker 1>but you're also very interested in having a family and some stability in your</v>

72
00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:46.684
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

73
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.590
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe you're interested in pursuing a sexual relationship with a whole</v>

74
00:03:50.591 --> 00:03:51.640
<v Speaker 1>sequence of people,</v>

75
00:03:51.641 --> 00:03:54.910
<v Speaker 1>but you're also interested in having a family of stabilizing your life.</v>

76
00:03:54.911 --> 00:03:59.911
<v Speaker 1>It's not obvious that those desires can exist in the same universe without</v>

77
00:04:00.851 --> 00:04:05.320
<v Speaker 1>producing what you might think about as a war and some of that might be a</v>

78
00:04:05.321 --> 00:04:06.460
<v Speaker 1>psychological war,</v>

79
00:04:06.461 --> 00:04:11.461
<v Speaker 1>but some of it's also going to be a war that actually occurs in the existence.</v>

80
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:13.151
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

81
00:04:13.151 --> 00:04:17.260
<v Speaker 1>you're fighting through the contradictory consequences of wanting to pursue many</v>

82
00:04:17.261 --> 00:04:20.200
<v Speaker 1>people and formulate a stable relationship with one person.</v>

83
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.530
<v Speaker 1>Well part of the reason that you want to think about these sorts of things is</v>

84
00:04:26.531 --> 00:04:31.531
<v Speaker 1>because if you think about them and get your thoughts and your value system</v>

85
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.890
<v Speaker 1>intelligently and coherently and cogently laid out,</v>

86
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.360
<v Speaker 1>then when you act out that value system in the world,</v>

87
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.620
<v Speaker 1>you're going to run into less conflict and less uncertainty and less misery and</v>

88
00:04:47.621 --> 00:04:51.790
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have a higher probability of getting what it is that you want.</v>

89
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.110
<v Speaker 1>But you're also going to have a higher probability of getting what you want in a</v>

90
00:04:56.111 --> 00:05:01.111
<v Speaker 1>way that allows you to cooperate with other people without entering into too</v>

91
00:05:01.271 --> 00:05:02.530
<v Speaker 1>much conflict with them.</v>

92
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.880
<v Speaker 1>And so in some sense the purpose that you think,</v>

93
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.620
<v Speaker 1>the reason that you think are the purpose of thinking is so that you can sort</v>

94
00:05:11.621 --> 00:05:16.621
<v Speaker 1>out how you're going to move forward in the world without having to directly run</v>

95
00:05:19.331 --> 00:05:23.020
<v Speaker 1>headlong into all the obstacles that you might run into if you were doing such a</v>

96
00:05:23.021 --> 00:05:23.854
<v Speaker 1>thing blindly.</v>

97
00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.510
<v Speaker 1>And so then you might ask yourself,</v>

98
00:05:25.511 --> 00:05:25.631
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

99
00:05:25.631 --> 00:05:29.020
<v Speaker 1>why would you bother reading philosophy?</v>

100
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.020
<v Speaker 1>The philosophy written by someone who's great.</v>

101
00:05:32.021 --> 00:05:33.010
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is,</v>

102
00:05:33.011 --> 00:05:38.011
<v Speaker 1>is that they can help you think these things through in a manner that you would</v>

103
00:05:39.071 --> 00:05:41.230
<v Speaker 1>not be capable of doing on your own.</v>

104
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.891
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

105
00:05:41.891 --> 00:05:43.920
<v Speaker 1>because Nisha,</v>

106
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

107
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.650
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult to estimate how intelligent needs you wise,</v>

108
00:05:47.651 --> 00:05:51.730
<v Speaker 1>but I suspect he was perhaps one in a billion,</v>

109
00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:56.800
<v Speaker 1>which would put him far beyond the 99.99 ninth percentile.</v>

110
00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:02.470
<v Speaker 1>And there's a massive difference between the ability of people to think as you</v>

111
00:06:03.891 --> 00:06:07.910
<v Speaker 1>move farther and farther out into the extremes of intelligence.</v>

112
00:06:07.911 --> 00:06:12.911
<v Speaker 1>And when you have the writings of someone who's one in a billion,</v>

113
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.840
<v Speaker 1>then you can interact with those writings in a way that enables you,</v>

114
00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:19.550
<v Speaker 1>if you'll put the time into</v>

115
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:24.920
<v Speaker 1>benefit from the spectacular fact of that intelligence.</v>
