1
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:07.250
<v Speaker 1>We also have</v>

2
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.170
<v Speaker 1>discount by the way,</v>

3
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.750
<v Speaker 1>my partners and I decided to,</v>

4
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:15.163
<v Speaker 2>mmm.</v>

5
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.920
<v Speaker 1>Encourage everybody to</v>

6
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.720
<v Speaker 2>make a,</v>

7
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.750
<v Speaker 1>their new year's resolutions in a sophisticated and comprehensive way.</v>

8
00:00:24.751 --> 00:00:26.400
<v Speaker 1>And so we have this program.</v>

9
00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:31.401
<v Speaker 1>Some of you have heard about this@selfauthoring.com called future authoring.</v>

10
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.990
<v Speaker 1>And the future authoring program helps you write out a vision for the future to</v>

11
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.430
<v Speaker 1>think through what you'd like your life to be like if you were taking care of</v>

12
00:00:41.431 --> 00:00:42.510
<v Speaker 1>yourself properly,</v>

13
00:00:42.511 --> 00:00:47.070
<v Speaker 1>to consider your friends and your family and your career and your education and</v>

14
00:00:47.071 --> 00:00:51.660
<v Speaker 1>your use of time outside of work and your ability to resist temptation,</v>

15
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.350
<v Speaker 1>the kind of temptation that might drag you down and,</v>

16
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.213
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

17
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.890
<v Speaker 1>and how you might take care of yourself mentally and physically.</v>

18
00:00:59.891 --> 00:01:02.410
<v Speaker 1>And to write about that and then to write a counter,</v>

19
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:04.041
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>

21
00:01:04.041 --> 00:01:07.250
<v Speaker 1>which was where you might be three to five years down the road if you let all</v>

22
00:01:07.251 --> 00:01:11.450
<v Speaker 1>your bad habits get out of control and then to write a strategic plan.</v>

23
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.280
<v Speaker 1>It's a very useful program.</v>

24
00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:16.040
<v Speaker 1>We've used it with lots of university students in particular,</v>

25
00:01:16.041 --> 00:01:16.820
<v Speaker 1>although it's for,</v>

26
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.350
<v Speaker 1>for adults of all ages.</v>

27
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:19.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

28
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.640
<v Speaker 1>and if you're a university student and you complete the program,</v>

29
00:01:22.641 --> 00:01:27.290
<v Speaker 1>it seems to increase the probability that you'll stay in university by about 25%</v>

30
00:01:27.291 --> 00:01:28.220
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

31
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.210
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

32
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.100
<v Speaker 1>it seems particularly useful by the way,</v>

33
00:01:31.101 --> 00:01:31.701
<v Speaker 1>for men,</v>

34
00:01:31.701 --> 00:01:34.400
<v Speaker 1>for reasons that we don't exactly understand,</v>

35
00:01:34.401 --> 00:01:39.080
<v Speaker 1>maybe because they're underperforming women academically and it also improves</v>

36
00:01:39.081 --> 00:01:39.891
<v Speaker 1>people's grades.</v>

37
00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:44.090
<v Speaker 1>But there's a large literature in the industrial organizational area also</v>

38
00:01:44.091 --> 00:01:47.300
<v Speaker 1>indicating that if you're like,</v>

39
00:01:47.301 --> 00:01:51.890
<v Speaker 1>if you're working and you make a personal plan of this sort,</v>

40
00:01:51.891 --> 00:01:56.690
<v Speaker 1>then your overall productivity increases by about 10% which is a lot.</v>

41
00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.950
<v Speaker 1>And you're,</v>

42
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.650
<v Speaker 1>you're more likely to be physically and mentally healthy.</v>

43
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.890
<v Speaker 1>And so I would really recommend trying this.</v>

44
00:02:03.891 --> 00:02:05.600
<v Speaker 1>Even you can try the program,</v>

45
00:02:05.601 --> 00:02:07.220
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to do a perfect job at it.</v>

46
00:02:07.221 --> 00:02:10.610
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't really matter because it turned to set out a bit of a vision and a</v>

47
00:02:10.611 --> 00:02:11.570
<v Speaker 1>plan for your life.</v>

48
00:02:11.571 --> 00:02:15.920
<v Speaker 1>And you need that because you need direction and you need purpose and you need</v>

49
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.790
<v Speaker 1>the constraints of a vision to help you be less anxious and uncertain.</v>

50
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.751
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

51
00:02:20.751 --> 00:02:21.830
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>

52
00:02:21.831 --> 00:02:26.831
<v Speaker 1>you have that anxiety and uncertainty reduction does occur if you have a decent</v>

53
00:02:26.931 --> 00:02:28.910
<v Speaker 1>map of where it is that you're headed.</v>

54
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.270
<v Speaker 1>The coupon code is n y 2019 New Year's 2019 and why 2019 and if you go to the</v>

55
00:02:37.341 --> 00:02:41.960
<v Speaker 1>self authoring site and click on the products menu,</v>

56
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

57
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.083
<v Speaker 2>item</v>

58
00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.380
<v Speaker 1>and go to a future author and you could just enter in that coupon code and it's</v>

59
00:02:47.381 --> 00:02:48.340
<v Speaker 1>50% off.</v>

60
00:02:48.341 --> 00:02:51.550
<v Speaker 1>So I think the total price is $7 and 45 cents,</v>

61
00:02:51.551 --> 00:02:54.130
<v Speaker 1>which is actually pretty damn cheap.</v>

62
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.430
<v Speaker 1>If what it does is help structure your future.</v>

63
00:02:57.431 --> 00:02:59.110
<v Speaker 1>And I really do think this is a helpful,</v>

64
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.590
<v Speaker 1>we've worked on it a lot and tested a lot and it's based on solid behavioral</v>

65
00:03:04.661 --> 00:03:06.040
<v Speaker 1>psychological principles,</v>

66
00:03:06.041 --> 00:03:06.874
<v Speaker 1>Lli with,</v>

67
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.620
<v Speaker 1>I would say a certain degree of,</v>

68
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.100
<v Speaker 1>of optimistic philosophy and um,</v>

69
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.413
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

70
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:14.643
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

71
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:17.950
<v Speaker 1>it's a good thing to do</v>

72
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.460
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

73
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:21.970
<v Speaker 1>this is a good time to do it.</v>

74
00:03:21.971 --> 00:03:22.930
<v Speaker 1>So if you're interested,</v>

75
00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.870
<v Speaker 1>all that information will be in the description of the video as well.</v>
