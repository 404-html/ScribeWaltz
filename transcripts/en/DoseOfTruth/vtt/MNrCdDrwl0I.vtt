00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.140
<v Speaker 1>Consciousness is something like an error detection and rectification system,</v>

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.063
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

3
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:06.870
<v Speaker 1>And so you can say,</v>

4
00:00:06.871 --> 00:00:07.021
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

5
00:00:07.021 --> 00:00:10.590
<v Speaker 1>you can practice being conscious because what that means in some sense is you're</v>

6
00:00:10.591 --> 00:00:12.060
<v Speaker 1>always attending to your errors.</v>

7
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.330
<v Speaker 1>Not seems to be a really intelligent thing to do if you don't take it too far</v>

8
00:00:16.331 --> 00:00:17.730
<v Speaker 1>and collapse yourself.</v>

9
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.010
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're always attending to your errors,</v>

10
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.730
<v Speaker 1>you're always improving your automated adaptability,</v>

11
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.073
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

12
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

13
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.183
<v Speaker 1>Pay Attention,</v>

14
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.950
<v Speaker 1>see if things are working out the way that you want them to.</v>

15
00:00:28.951 --> 00:00:29.784
<v Speaker 1>And if they're not,</v>

16
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.620
<v Speaker 1>modify your,</v>

17
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.310
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

18
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:33.091
<v Speaker 1>your approach,</v>

19
00:00:33.091 --> 00:00:33.870
<v Speaker 1>your perceptions.</v>

20
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:34.111
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

21
00:00:34.111 --> 00:00:39.111
<v Speaker 1>So you've conserved the systems and the systems emerged to,</v>

22
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.740
<v Speaker 1>to solve the problems of the emergent complexity and you end up at birth with</v>

23
00:00:43.741 --> 00:00:45.180
<v Speaker 1>all of these conserved systems.</v>

24
00:00:45.181 --> 00:00:48.540
<v Speaker 1>And so those would be proclivities that would enable you to</v>

25
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.150
<v Speaker 1>manifest necessary realm of behaviors in the social,</v>

26
00:00:54.151 --> 00:00:54.721
<v Speaker 1>natural,</v>

27
00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:55.650
<v Speaker 1>human environment,</v>

28
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:56.580
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

29
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.560
<v Speaker 1>So you're basically prepared for that.</v>

30
00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:59.011
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

31
00:00:59.011 --> 00:01:02.610
<v Speaker 1>I told you I went through what those were last time and you can break them down</v>

32
00:01:02.611 --> 00:01:03.770
<v Speaker 1>into um,</v>

33
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.400
<v Speaker 1>self-maintenance motivations and self propagation motivations,</v>

34
00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:08.234
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

35
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.533
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

36
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:10.231
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

37
00:01:10.231 --> 00:01:12.960
<v Speaker 1>now the question is how did those manifest themselves?</v>

38
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.850
<v Speaker 1>And that's where we get,</v>

39
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.400
<v Speaker 1>that's where we can make a shift,</v>

40
00:01:17.401 --> 00:01:22.401
<v Speaker 1>say from evolutionary ideas and biological ideas to narrative ideas.</v>

41
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.040
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

42
00:01:25.041 --> 00:01:27.720
<v Speaker 1>I've made the case for you that you exist within,</v>

43
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.620
<v Speaker 1>within this thing.</v>

44
00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:31.740
<v Speaker 1>I've never figured out exactly what to call it because you can call it a game or</v>

45
00:01:31.741 --> 00:01:33.330
<v Speaker 1>you can call it a frame of reference,</v>

46
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.410
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty good one.</v>

47
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.420
<v Speaker 1>Or you can call it a story.</v>

48
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:37.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

49
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.350
<v Speaker 1>or you can call it a unit of perception.</v>

50
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.780
<v Speaker 1>But it,</v>

51
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.120
<v Speaker 1>that's not exactly right cause it's more than perception.</v>

52
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.043
<v Speaker 1>It's really this,</v>

53
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.230
<v Speaker 1>it's a really what it is is a micro personality.</v>

54
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:47.281
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

55
00:01:47.281 --> 00:01:48.210
<v Speaker 1>it's your,</v>

56
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.570
<v Speaker 1>it's your personality as it manifests itself at it,</v>

57
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.460
<v Speaker 1>at the highest possible resolution.</v>

58
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.323
<v Speaker 1>That's what this is.</v>

59
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.830
<v Speaker 1>And so if I'm,</v>

60
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

61
00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.960
<v Speaker 1>let's say I set myself the task of moving those keys from there to here.</v>

62
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.450
<v Speaker 1>So my perceptual frame is,</v>

63
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.543
<v Speaker 1>it's this thing,</v>

64
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.120
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

65
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.230
<v Speaker 1>well what's the world?</v>

66
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.750
<v Speaker 1>Everything else can be ignored.</v>

67
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.710
<v Speaker 1>I need to make an object out of my hand,</v>

68
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.110
<v Speaker 1>these keys,</v>

69
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.450
<v Speaker 1>that tiny spot on the table.</v>

70
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:22.171
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

71
00:02:22.171 --> 00:02:27.171
<v Speaker 1>and my goal is to transform this pattern into that pattern.</v>

72
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.340
<v Speaker 1>And it's a pattern because it maintains itself across time,</v>

73
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:33.151
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

74
00:02:33.151 --> 00:02:34.980
<v Speaker 1>It's not like smoke or cloud.</v>

75
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.060
<v Speaker 1>It persists.</v>

76
00:02:36.061 --> 00:02:37.440
<v Speaker 1>So there it is.</v>

77
00:02:37.441 --> 00:02:37.981
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>

78
00:02:37.981 --> 00:02:38.521
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>

79
00:02:38.521 --> 00:02:39.300
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>

80
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.400
<v Speaker 1>That's a pattern that's extending across time.</v>

81
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.040
<v Speaker 1>So I have this goal,</v>

82
00:02:44.041 --> 00:02:47.490
<v Speaker 1>which is the transformation of this into that and that goal.</v>

83
00:02:47.491 --> 00:02:49.320
<v Speaker 1>So that would be roughly speaking,</v>

84
00:02:49.321 --> 00:02:50.520
<v Speaker 1>the goal is point B.</v>

85
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.630
<v Speaker 1>But you can't just think about this as something that's a goal because it isn't</v>

86
00:02:54.631 --> 00:02:55.464
<v Speaker 1>just a goal.</v>

87
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.540
<v Speaker 1>There's a goal,</v>

88
00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.070
<v Speaker 1>which is the end,</v>

89
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.640
<v Speaker 1>which is the end state</v>

90
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.630
<v Speaker 1>of this entire process.</v>

91
00:03:03.631 --> 00:03:04.830
<v Speaker 1>The End State is,</v>

92
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.620
<v Speaker 1>I've moved the thing from here to here.</v>

93
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.760
<v Speaker 1>I've transformed this into this and I've done it using action.</v>

94
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:13.660
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

95
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.370
<v Speaker 1>so that's a useful thing to know too.</v>

96
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.010
<v Speaker 1>I have an abstract notion.</v>

97
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.700
<v Speaker 1>That's my decision that I'm going to get the world to manifest this pattern</v>

98
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.290
<v Speaker 1>instead of this one.</v>

99
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.491
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

100
00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:28.810
<v Speaker 1>So that gives me my target.</v>

101
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.243
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

102
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.050
<v Speaker 1>that's an abstraction.</v>

103
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.461
<v Speaker 1>Good,</v>

104
00:03:32.461 --> 00:03:33.294
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

105
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.890
<v Speaker 1>But when I actually do the transformation,</v>

106
00:03:35.891 --> 00:03:39.940
<v Speaker 1>that's not an abstraction because now I'm using actual action,</v>

107
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.170
<v Speaker 1>actual behavior.</v>

108
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.380
<v Speaker 1>And so I take this abstract micro personality.</v>

109
00:03:44.381 --> 00:03:48.100
<v Speaker 1>This is the part that's operating on this tiny little section of the world.</v>

110
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.070
<v Speaker 1>I make the transformation and as soon as I do that,</v>

111
00:03:51.071 --> 00:03:51.910
<v Speaker 1>another thing happens,</v>

112
00:03:51.911 --> 00:03:53.620
<v Speaker 1>which is I don't need that anymore.</v>

113
00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.220
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

114
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.690
<v Speaker 1>I moved to the next one of those,</v>

115
00:03:55.691 --> 00:03:56.890
<v Speaker 1>whatever it happens to be.</v>

116
00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.130
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things we're going to have to figure out is what is the</v>

117
00:04:00.131 --> 00:04:01.930
<v Speaker 1>relationship between these things?</v>

118
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.750
<v Speaker 1>Because you're always in one of them and they're scalable.</v>

119
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.120
<v Speaker 1>So like when you're doing a specific action,</v>

120
00:04:07.121 --> 00:04:11.050
<v Speaker 1>it's really high resolution and that's kind of where you want to be operating.</v>

121
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.210
<v Speaker 1>When you know what you're doing,</v>

122
00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:14.530
<v Speaker 1>that's where you want to be operating,</v>

123
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:15.483
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

124
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:17.800
<v Speaker 1>when you're trying to do something new,</v>

125
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.000
<v Speaker 1>but it's scalable.</v>

126
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:24.330
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the framework which is constructed in part from these motivational</v>

127
00:04:25.241 --> 00:04:26.710
<v Speaker 1>systems that he merged over.</v>

128
00:04:26.711 --> 00:04:27.910
<v Speaker 1>Evolutionary history.</v>

129
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.760
<v Speaker 1>The framework specifies the current condition,</v>

130
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.350
<v Speaker 1>the desired condition,</v>

131
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.100
<v Speaker 1>and am the behavioral manifestations that are necessary to make the</v>

132
00:04:36.101 --> 00:04:36.934
<v Speaker 1>transformation.</v>

133
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.500
<v Speaker 1>And so you can't think about it as a drive cause its instincts are often thought</v>

134
00:04:41.501 --> 00:04:43.330
<v Speaker 1>about is drives or as a goal.</v>

135
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.750
<v Speaker 1>It's not correct because the thing actually determines your perceptions.</v>

136
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.740
<v Speaker 1>It determines what objects manifest themselves to you in the world or,</v>

137
00:04:52.741 --> 00:04:53.590
<v Speaker 1>or what patterns.</v>

138
00:04:53.591 --> 00:04:54.790
<v Speaker 1>That's another way of thinking about it.</v>

139
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.350
<v Speaker 1>Cause like when I'm looking at this,</v>

140
00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.130
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

141
00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.290
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to watch your own perceptions.</v>

142
00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:00.580
<v Speaker 1>But when I'm looking at this,</v>

143
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:02.523
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>

144
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.640
<v Speaker 1>I can see that chair.</v>

145
00:05:03.641 --> 00:05:04.810
<v Speaker 1>But if I didn't know it was a chair,</v>

146
00:05:04.811 --> 00:05:06.360
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be able to tell by looking by,</v>

147
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.720
<v Speaker 1>by my visual input,</v>

148
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.430
<v Speaker 1>I can kind of see this one.</v>

149
00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.960
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

150
00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.790
<v Speaker 1>Although I really can't tell what color it is.</v>

151
00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.190
<v Speaker 1>That one slightly clearer.</v>

152
00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.840
<v Speaker 1>This is pretty blurry here.</v>

153
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.400
<v Speaker 1>Like I can't see my fingers.</v>

154
00:05:19.401 --> 00:05:20.480
<v Speaker 1>If I'm looking at the keys,</v>

155
00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.150
<v Speaker 1>I can't see my fingers unless they move.</v>

156
00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.861
<v Speaker 1>And I'm very,</v>

157
00:05:24.861 --> 00:05:25.820
<v Speaker 1>very focused on that.</v>

158
00:05:25.821 --> 00:05:29.810
<v Speaker 1>So what happens is that all the rest of the world turns into a low resolution</v>

159
00:05:29.811 --> 00:05:32.360
<v Speaker 1>representations that vanishes on its periphery.</v>

160
00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.860
<v Speaker 1>The resolution increases as uh,</v>

161
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.730
<v Speaker 1>as I moved towards the central part of my visual field.</v>

162
00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.420
<v Speaker 1>And here it's sharp enough so that I can actually see the letters on that key.</v>

163
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:43.783
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

164
00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.230
<v Speaker 1>so my desire,</v>

165
00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.870
<v Speaker 1>which I am indicating by the point of my eyes,</v>

166
00:05:47.871 --> 00:05:52.070
<v Speaker 1>is specifying the objects that I see and specifying their level of resolution.</v>

167
00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.040
<v Speaker 1>So you can't just call that a drive or a goal.</v>

168
00:05:55.041 --> 00:05:55.321
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

169
00:05:55.321 --> 00:05:55.610
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

170
00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:56.443
<v Speaker 1>that's not right.</v>

171
00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:57.320
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

172
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.680
<v Speaker 1>it's the mechanism that makes the world manifest itself to you.</v>

173
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.880
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

174
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:02.211
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

175
00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:02.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

176
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.500
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably crazy thing is that the world manifest itself to you in keeping</v>

177
00:06:06.501 --> 00:06:07.334
<v Speaker 1>with your goals.</v>

178
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:07.911
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

179
00:06:07.911 --> 00:06:12.650
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean that you can make the world do any old thing because it pushes</v>

180
00:06:12.651 --> 00:06:13.071
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

181
00:06:13.071 --> 00:06:13.281
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

182
00:06:13.281 --> 00:06:14.510
<v Speaker 1>It objects to you.</v>

183
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.441
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

184
00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:16.101
<v Speaker 1>but still,</v>

185
00:06:16.101 --> 00:06:16.600
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

186
00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.190
<v Speaker 1>it's very strange thing that,</v>

187
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.633
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

188
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:21.231
<v Speaker 1>so fine.</v>

189
00:06:21.231 --> 00:06:24.320
<v Speaker 1>So it specifies your perceptions,</v>

190
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.393
<v Speaker 1>your target,</v>

191
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:30.320
<v Speaker 1>the current reality and the likely procedure that you're going to use to make</v>

192
00:06:30.321 --> 00:06:31.370
<v Speaker 1>all of that interrelated.</v>

193
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:32.690
<v Speaker 1>But it does more than that.</v>

194
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.950
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>

195
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:34.310
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna,</v>

196
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.470
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna look at it from a couple of different perspectives.</v>

197
00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:37.820
<v Speaker 1>So the classic</v>

198
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:44.060
<v Speaker 1>and archaic way of thinking about perception has the world's full of objects.</v>

199
00:06:44.061 --> 00:06:44.871
<v Speaker 1>You see the objects,</v>

200
00:06:44.871 --> 00:06:45.531
<v Speaker 1>you think about them,</v>

201
00:06:45.531 --> 00:06:46.351
<v Speaker 1>you evaluate them.</v>

202
00:06:46.351 --> 00:06:47.210
<v Speaker 1>And then you act on them.</v>

203
00:06:47.211 --> 00:06:47.511
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

204
00:06:47.511 --> 00:06:47.781
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

205
00:06:47.781 --> 00:06:48.740
<v Speaker 1>that isn't how it works.</v>

206
00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:49.191
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

207
00:06:49.191 --> 00:06:50.780
<v Speaker 1>the world is not made out of objects.</v>

208
00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.310
<v Speaker 1>The world is made out of.</v>

209
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:57.410
<v Speaker 1>I think the world is made out of tools and obstacles and it's because you can't</v>

210
00:06:57.411 --> 00:07:01.280
<v Speaker 1>not perceive the world in relationship to you and what you perceive actually or</v>

211
00:07:01.281 --> 00:07:04.650
<v Speaker 1>the meaning of objects you perceive the patterns.</v>

212
00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:09.710
<v Speaker 1>A tool is something like a meaningful pattern or useful pattern in something</v>

213
00:07:09.711 --> 00:07:10.131
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

214
00:07:10.131 --> 00:07:10.850
<v Speaker 1>And so look,</v>

215
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:12.200
<v Speaker 1>look again,</v>

216
00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.273
<v Speaker 1>you look at,</v>

217
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.600
<v Speaker 1>I might say to someone described this room,</v>

218
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.060
<v Speaker 1>now you're going to pick,</v>

219
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.320
<v Speaker 1>you're going to pick a level of description that's very particular.</v>

220
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.170
<v Speaker 1>You're going to pick one that other human beings could understand.</v>

221
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:29.870
<v Speaker 1>So it's going to be predicated on an on your size,</v>

222
00:07:29.871 --> 00:07:30.471
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

223
00:07:30.471 --> 00:07:33.410
<v Speaker 1>And so you're going to be predicated on your knowledge that that other person is</v>

224
00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:38.330
<v Speaker 1>a lot like you and has a lot of the same underlying structures and motivations.</v>

225
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:38.860
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

226
00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.030
<v Speaker 1>and that's an implicit predicate of your description.</v>

227
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:41.811
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to say,</v>

228
00:07:41.811 --> 00:07:42.231
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

229
00:07:42.231 --> 00:07:43.940
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of an ordinary classroom.</v>

230
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:49.150
<v Speaker 1>It's got 20 rows of tables that each have five chairs at it and each of them</v>

231
00:07:50.421 --> 00:07:50.691
<v Speaker 1>does,</v>

232
00:07:50.691 --> 00:07:51.590
<v Speaker 1>has five chairs.</v>

233
00:07:51.591 --> 00:07:53.180
<v Speaker 1>There's some posts that hold them up.</v>

234
00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:54.170
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

235
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:55.490
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple of speakers.</v>

236
00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:56.540
<v Speaker 1>There's a podium,</v>

237
00:07:56.541 --> 00:07:57.560
<v Speaker 1>there's a screen,</v>

238
00:07:57.561 --> 00:07:59.270
<v Speaker 1>there's some additional chairs,</v>

239
00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:00.800
<v Speaker 1>there's a scattering of people.</v>

240
00:08:00.801 --> 00:08:02.360
<v Speaker 1>There are some electronic equipment.</v>

241
00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:04.400
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>

242
00:08:04.401 --> 00:08:07.100
<v Speaker 1>of course that there's an infinite number of things I could be describing in</v>

243
00:08:07.101 --> 00:08:07.934
<v Speaker 1>this room.</v>

244
00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:08.481
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

245
00:08:08.481 --> 00:08:09.680
<v Speaker 1>Like I could be describing,</v>

246
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:12.800
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of color variation in that tile.</v>

247
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:14.000
<v Speaker 1>So if I look at it,</v>

248
00:08:14.001 --> 00:08:18.350
<v Speaker 1>I can see that it's unlike the other tiles because the light is reflecting off</v>

249
00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:18.800
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

250
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.570
<v Speaker 1>So it's got a shiny white element.</v>

251
00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:21.583
<v Speaker 1>There's about,</v>

252
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:26.000
<v Speaker 1>God only knows a million different scratches in it each which are unique.</v>

253
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.490
<v Speaker 1>I can't even really tell what color it is.</v>

254
00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:31.010
<v Speaker 1>It kind of looks like an off grayish green.</v>

255
00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:35.120
<v Speaker 1>But if I was painting it to get a reasonable representation,</v>

256
00:08:35.121 --> 00:08:40.121
<v Speaker 1>I'd had to have to have at least six or seven shades of green ranging from quite</v>

257
00:08:41.841 --> 00:08:43.160
<v Speaker 1>dark to almost white.</v>

258
00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:46.100
<v Speaker 1>And that's only if I look at it from here.</v>

259
00:08:46.101 --> 00:08:47.420
<v Speaker 1>If I look at it from here,</v>

260
00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:49.580
<v Speaker 1>well then you get the point,</v>

261
00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:49.881
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

262
00:08:49.881 --> 00:08:53.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean there is an infinite number of details in this room.</v>

263
00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:55.650
<v Speaker 1>There's an infinite number of facts in this room.</v>

264
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.460
<v Speaker 1>That's also why I don't believe that you can derive an art form.</v>

265
00:08:59.461 --> 00:09:00.294
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

266
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:01.340
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

267
00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:01.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

268
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:03.060
<v Speaker 1>that's the old humean issue,</v>

269
00:09:03.061 --> 00:09:03.301
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

270
00:09:03.301 --> 00:09:06.570
<v Speaker 1>You cannot derive ethical guidelines from factual knowledge.</v>

271
00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.900
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reason for that is which facts are going to pick?</v>

272
00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:13.660
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to select them?</v>

273
00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:14.710
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

274
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:16.420
<v Speaker 1>there's an infinite number of them,</v>

275
00:09:16.421 --> 00:09:18.070
<v Speaker 1>even in a constrained situation.</v>

276
00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:23.290
<v Speaker 1>So merely by attending to some and not attending to others,</v>

277
00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:28.380
<v Speaker 1>you're already using an ethic because you can't attend to one thing and not</v>

278
00:09:28.691 --> 00:09:32.110
<v Speaker 1>another without being ensconced in one of these value structures.</v>

279
00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:35.380
<v Speaker 1>Because the value structure is what determines the direction of your attention.</v>

280
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:39.460
<v Speaker 1>And so you can't make the argument that you're using the,</v>

281
00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:44.620
<v Speaker 1>the infinite number of facts that are available at your disposal to govern how</v>

282
00:09:44.621 --> 00:09:45.850
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at the facts.</v>

283
00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:46.600
<v Speaker 1>You're not,</v>

284
00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:47.530
<v Speaker 1>that isn't what you're doing.</v>

285
00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.060
<v Speaker 1>It's not possible to do that.</v>

286
00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:50.410
<v Speaker 1>So what do you do?</v>

287
00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:51.723
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

288
00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:56.080
<v Speaker 1>you described the things in the room that would be relevant to other people.</v>

289
00:09:56.081 --> 00:09:58.420
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise you're going to bore them to death or they're going to think you're</v>

290
00:09:58.421 --> 00:09:59.254
<v Speaker 1>insane,</v>

291
00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:00.071
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

292
00:10:00.071 --> 00:10:00.850
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

293
00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:04.240
<v Speaker 1>or an artist maybe because an artist might do the kind of concentration on a</v>

294
00:10:04.241 --> 00:10:05.590
<v Speaker 1>detail that I just described,</v>

295
00:10:05.591 --> 00:10:06.610
<v Speaker 1>but he's obviously,</v>

296
00:10:06.611 --> 00:10:09.850
<v Speaker 1>or she's obviously trying to paint the thing are represented somehow.</v>

297
00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:11.380
<v Speaker 1>So it's still tool like,</v>

298
00:10:11.381 --> 00:10:14.440
<v Speaker 1>well why do you want to know that there are tables while,</v>

299
00:10:14.441 --> 00:10:15.274
<v Speaker 1>cause you said at the,</v>

300
00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:16.750
<v Speaker 1>why do you want to know if there are chairs?</v>

301
00:10:16.751 --> 00:10:18.070
<v Speaker 1>Because you sit in them.</v>

302
00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:18.850
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

303
00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:22.990
<v Speaker 1>what about the screen or the camera equipment while they're all usable tools.</v>

304
00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:24.970
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what you described.</v>

305
00:10:24.971 --> 00:10:29.140
<v Speaker 1>You described the world at the level of usable tool or you might also say,</v>

306
00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:30.413
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

307
00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:30.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

308
00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:33.520
<v Speaker 1>look out for that girl who's third in the third row,</v>

309
00:10:33.521 --> 00:10:34.354
<v Speaker 1>she's trouble.</v>

310
00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:39.800
<v Speaker 1>And so you might call out someone if you're describing the room because there is</v>

311
00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:42.700
<v Speaker 1>somewhere in that room that if you go,</v>

312
00:10:42.701 --> 00:10:44.110
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get into trouble.</v>

313
00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:45.520
<v Speaker 1>And so and so.</v>

314
00:10:45.521 --> 00:10:47.920
<v Speaker 1>Those are sort of the things that seem to me to be relevant.</v>

315
00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:50.500
<v Speaker 1>There are tools that move you along your way.</v>

316
00:10:50.501 --> 00:10:51.430
<v Speaker 1>Facilitators,</v>

317
00:10:51.431 --> 00:10:54.700
<v Speaker 1>that's another way of thinking about that and there are obstacles that get in</v>

318
00:10:54.701 --> 00:10:58.180
<v Speaker 1>your way and there's a tiny set of those.</v>

319
00:10:58.420 --> 00:10:59.620
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise you get overwhelmed.</v>

320
00:10:59.621 --> 00:11:02.290
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to go anywhere where it's all obstacles,</v>

321
00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:02.950
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

322
00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:03.783
<v Speaker 1>You don't even mind.</v>

323
00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:05.800
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to be in that place.</v>

324
00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:08.890
<v Speaker 1>You want to be at a place where it's mostly this and then,</v>

325
00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:09.970
<v Speaker 1>then there's a,</v>

326
00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:11.320
<v Speaker 1>the biggest category though,</v>

327
00:11:11.321 --> 00:11:12.490
<v Speaker 1>this is what's cool,</v>

328
00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:13.241
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

329
00:11:13.241 --> 00:11:14.440
<v Speaker 1>and this is so important,</v>

330
00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:19.960
<v Speaker 1>is the biggest perceptual category is that which is not relevant at this time</v>

331
00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:22.120
<v Speaker 1>because it contains everything.</v>

332
00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:22.691
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

333
00:11:22.691 --> 00:11:23.350
<v Speaker 1>like when you're,</v>

334
00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:24.400
<v Speaker 1>when you're writing on this,</v>

335
00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:25.360
<v Speaker 1>on this pad,</v>

336
00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:31.300
<v Speaker 1>you assumed the entire world around you is constant and therefore you can ignore</v>

337
00:11:31.301 --> 00:11:31.660
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

338
00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:33.250
<v Speaker 1>It's everything out there.</v>

339
00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:35.560
<v Speaker 1>All the transformations that are taking place,</v>

340
00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:40.800
<v Speaker 1>you turned to zero and you just focus on maybe the space that's occupied by a</v>

341
00:11:41.561 --> 00:11:42.520
<v Speaker 1>single letter.</v>

342
00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:46.420
<v Speaker 1>The whole world Trinks down to just that single letter and everything else is</v>

343
00:11:46.421 --> 00:11:47.254
<v Speaker 1>ignored.</v>

344
00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:47.711
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

345
00:11:47.711 --> 00:11:49.360
<v Speaker 1>what happens if something goes wrong?</v>

346
00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:50.350
<v Speaker 1>This is the thing.</v>

347
00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:51.730
<v Speaker 1>This is why this is important.</v>

348
00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:53.590
<v Speaker 1>What happens if something goes wrong?</v>

349
00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:59.530
<v Speaker 1>An indeterminate set of those irrelevant entities has now become relevant.</v>

350
00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:04.270
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem is the invisibility disappears.</v>

351
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:05.201
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

352
00:12:05.201 --> 00:12:05.980
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>
