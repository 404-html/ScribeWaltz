1
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.150
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I've thought,</v>

2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.670
<v Speaker 1>this is a bit of a tangent,</v>

3
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.520
<v Speaker 1>but I'll move back to the mortal afterwards.</v>

4
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:10.200
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

5
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.340
<v Speaker 1>I really liked the psycho analyst and I liked the idea that you have a psyche</v>

6
00:00:14.341 --> 00:00:18.270
<v Speaker 1>that's inside of you and that that is structured in partly consciously and in</v>

7
00:00:18.271 --> 00:00:19.770
<v Speaker 1>part unconsciously.</v>

8
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.370
<v Speaker 1>There's something about that that's really cool and I've learned a lot from the</v>

9
00:00:23.371 --> 00:00:24.270
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalyst,</v>

10
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.201
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

11
00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:30.201
<v Speaker 1>there is a funny consequence of thinking the way they think and you do think the</v>

12
00:00:30.331 --> 00:00:30.931
<v Speaker 1>way they think,</v>

13
00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:31.950
<v Speaker 1>even if you don't know it.</v>

14
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.520
<v Speaker 1>Like we tend to think that a lot of us has inside our head.</v>

15
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:36.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

16
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.370
<v Speaker 1>that's the psyche model basically.</v>

17
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.760
<v Speaker 1>But the more I've practiced as a clinical psychologist,</v>

18
00:00:41.761 --> 00:00:42.241
<v Speaker 1>the last,</v>

19
00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:44.220
<v Speaker 1>I've actually been convinced that that's true.</v>

20
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.751
<v Speaker 1>So I could say,</v>

21
00:00:45.751 --> 00:00:46.110
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

22
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.570
<v Speaker 1>let's say I want to know about your personality.</v>

23
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.471
<v Speaker 1>We think,</v>

24
00:00:49.471 --> 00:00:49.621
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

25
00:00:49.621 --> 00:00:50.490
<v Speaker 1>I want to know you.</v>

26
00:00:50.491 --> 00:00:52.980
<v Speaker 1>I want to know about your subjectivity.</v>

27
00:00:52.981 --> 00:00:54.450
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to know what's inside of you,</v>

28
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.040
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't actually what you do.</v>

29
00:00:56.041 --> 00:00:56.650
<v Speaker 1>Want to know if,</v>

30
00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.950
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

31
00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.080
<v Speaker 1>if you're doing clinical work,</v>

32
00:00:58.081 --> 00:01:00.210
<v Speaker 1>say with someone you want to know,</v>

33
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.730
<v Speaker 1>did they have any friends?</v>

34
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.280
<v Speaker 1>That's really important because if you're miserable and anxious and badly placed</v>

35
00:01:08.281 --> 00:01:10.290
<v Speaker 1>in life and misbehaving,</v>

36
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.100
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons that all of that can occur is because you don't have any</v>

37
00:01:14.101 --> 00:01:14.401
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>

38
00:01:14.401 --> 00:01:15.240
<v Speaker 1>You don't know anyone.</v>

39
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.880
<v Speaker 1>And that's not something that's inside you.</v>

40
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.951
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

41
00:01:18.951 --> 00:01:22.650
<v Speaker 1>it's you localized in a broader sphere.</v>

42
00:01:22.651 --> 00:01:23.371
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>

43
00:01:23.371 --> 00:01:23.641
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

44
00:01:23.641 --> 00:01:25.890
<v Speaker 1>do you have job and well,</v>

45
00:01:25.891 --> 00:01:26.910
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about the job.</v>

46
00:01:26.911 --> 00:01:28.770
<v Speaker 1>Do you actually make enough money with your job?</v>

47
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.140
<v Speaker 1>Is it satisfying for you in any way?</v>

48
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.430
<v Speaker 1>Are you bullied all the time?</v>

49
00:01:32.431 --> 00:01:33.264
<v Speaker 1>When you're at work?</v>

50
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.740
<v Speaker 1>Does it provoke anxiety?</v>

51
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.530
<v Speaker 1>Is it a career that allows you to go somewhere?</v>

52
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:38.820
<v Speaker 1>Are you overworked?</v>

53
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

54
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.340
<v Speaker 1>but let's start with just the first question.</v>

55
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.840
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a job?</v>

56
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.201
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

57
00:01:43.201 --> 00:01:44.820
<v Speaker 1>if the answer to that is no,</v>

58
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.620
<v Speaker 1>you have a serious problem and that would enough might be to depress you and</v>

59
00:01:49.621 --> 00:01:52.710
<v Speaker 1>make you anxious and hopeless and nihilistic and all of those things.</v>

60
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.821
<v Speaker 1>And you could say,</v>

61
00:01:53.821 --> 00:01:54.001
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

62
00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:56.730
<v Speaker 1>you're not reacting very well to not having a job.</v>

63
00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.040
<v Speaker 1>But that's kind of a foolish objection,</v>

64
00:01:59.041 --> 00:02:00.600
<v Speaker 1>even though some of it might be true.</v>

65
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.770
<v Speaker 1>One problem is,</v>

66
00:02:01.771 --> 00:02:04.260
<v Speaker 1>is that you're not reacting very well to not having a job.</v>

67
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.130
<v Speaker 1>But another problem is that you don't have a job and that actually constitutes a</v>

68
00:02:08.131 --> 00:02:08.964
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>

69
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.510
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

70
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:10.530
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to eat.</v>

71
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.970
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a place to live.</v>

72
00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.670
<v Speaker 1>Those aren't psychological problems precisely,</v>

73
00:02:14.671 --> 00:02:17.520
<v Speaker 1>even though a psychological problem could make it worse.</v>

74
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

75
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.610
<v Speaker 1>are you as educated as you should be?</v>

76
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.780
<v Speaker 1>That's another question.</v>

77
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.610
<v Speaker 1>How do you handle drugs and alcohol?</v>

78
00:02:23.611 --> 00:02:25.440
<v Speaker 1>Are they taking you down a bad pathway?</v>

79
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:26.603
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

80
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:27.503
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

81
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.880
<v Speaker 1>what about intimate relationships?</v>

82
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:30.750
<v Speaker 1>Do you have one?</v>

83
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.450
<v Speaker 1>You have a plan for one or they,</v>

84
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.730
<v Speaker 1>is that a never ending series of catastrophes or something that you avoid</v>

85
00:02:35.731 --> 00:02:36.564
<v Speaker 1>completely.</v>

86
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.740
<v Speaker 1>That's a big problem.</v>

87
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.270
<v Speaker 1>And maybe people don't,</v>

88
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.550
<v Speaker 1>aren't attracted to you for one reason or another.</v>

89
00:02:41.551 --> 00:02:43.920
<v Speaker 1>And you can think about that as a psychological problem,</v>

90
00:02:43.921 --> 00:02:46.050
<v Speaker 1>but it's an interpersonal problem.</v>

91
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.560
<v Speaker 1>And the degree to which that's a psychological problem is,</v>

92
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.320
<v Speaker 1>is certainly an unspecified.</v>

93
00:02:52.321 --> 00:02:53.820
<v Speaker 1>When you first begin to talk to somebody,</v>

94
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.050
<v Speaker 1>what about your family?</v>

95
00:02:55.051 --> 00:02:56.100
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a family?</v>

96
00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.830
<v Speaker 1>Because it's hard to be in the world all by yourself.</v>

97
00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:59.710
<v Speaker 1>That's sure.</v>

98
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.630
<v Speaker 1>It makes things a lot more stressful.</v>

99
00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:04.900
<v Speaker 1>Even though having a family can also be extraordinarily stressful,</v>

100
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

101
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.420
<v Speaker 1>do you have plans to have children?</v>

102
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.920
<v Speaker 1>How are you doing with your parents?</v>

103
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.660
<v Speaker 1>Do you get along with your siblings?</v>

104
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.321
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

105
00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:12.070
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>

106
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.700
<v Speaker 1>All of that to me is more fundamental and it's outside of you.</v>

107
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.090
<v Speaker 1>Those are elements of your experience more broadly conceptualized more than they</v>

108
00:03:21.311 --> 00:03:25.090
<v Speaker 1>are objects of your psychology or of your internal experience.</v>

109
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.930
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

110
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:26.763
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of like</v>

111
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.581
<v Speaker 1>while a person is,</v>

112
00:03:31.581 --> 00:03:32.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

113
00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.510
<v Speaker 1>is it is a creature that exists at multiple levels of analysis,</v>

114
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.860
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

115
00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.410
<v Speaker 1>Something might go wrong with you at a cellular level,</v>

116
00:03:39.411 --> 00:03:41.810
<v Speaker 1>so maybe you're born with a genetic abnormality,</v>

117
00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.890
<v Speaker 1>so something's wrong with you molecularly or you have something wrong with a</v>

118
00:03:45.891 --> 00:03:46.730
<v Speaker 1>major organ.</v>

119
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.430
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe there's something wrong with you psychologically,</v>

120
00:03:49.431 --> 00:03:53.780
<v Speaker 1>or maybe you're in a pathological family or maybe you're stuck in a pathological</v>

121
00:03:53.781 --> 00:03:55.540
<v Speaker 1>social system and,</v>

122
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.140
<v Speaker 1>and figuring out what's,</v>

123
00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.310
<v Speaker 1>why you're suffering means going up and down those different levels.</v>

124
00:04:01.311 --> 00:04:04.280
<v Speaker 1>Trying to specify the appropriate level for analysis.</v>

125
00:04:04.281 --> 00:04:06.350
<v Speaker 1>And also the appropriate level for intervention.</v>

126
00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:07.940
<v Speaker 1>And for me as a,</v>

127
00:04:07.941 --> 00:04:08.541
<v Speaker 1>as I've said,</v>

128
00:04:08.541 --> 00:04:12.050
<v Speaker 1>even though I'm a great admirer of the psychoanalysts and I do things like dream</v>

129
00:04:12.051 --> 00:04:12.531
<v Speaker 1>analysis,</v>

130
00:04:12.531 --> 00:04:17.330
<v Speaker 1>which I really find you an incredibly useful and enlightening the first,</v>

131
00:04:17.331 --> 00:04:18.950
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental level of analysis is,</v>

132
00:04:18.951 --> 00:04:20.810
<v Speaker 1>well what's your experience structured like?</v>

133
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.033
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

134
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.810
<v Speaker 1>And that isn't localized in you.</v>

135
00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.890
<v Speaker 1>Now the behaviorists do that too because it's one of the things I really liked</v>

136
00:04:27.891 --> 00:04:29.750
<v Speaker 1>about the behavioral approach to psychotherapy.</v>

137
00:04:29.751 --> 00:04:30.171
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

138
00:04:30.171 --> 00:04:31.460
<v Speaker 1>very concrete and practical.</v>

139
00:04:31.461 --> 00:04:32.780
<v Speaker 1>It's like they'll say,</v>

140
00:04:32.781 --> 00:04:33.614
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

141
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.890
<v Speaker 1>there are certain things that you need to have in order to live properly and</v>

142
00:04:36.891 --> 00:04:40.520
<v Speaker 1>maybe you don't have the skills or the wherewithal where with all to accumulate</v>

143
00:04:40.521 --> 00:04:43.610
<v Speaker 1>them and we'll break them down into tiny little pieces and you'll practice.</v>

144
00:04:43.611 --> 00:04:44.510
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

145
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.490
<v Speaker 1>with someone who doesn't have any friends,</v>

146
00:04:46.491 --> 00:04:49.910
<v Speaker 1>then you do a micro analysis of their social skills,</v>

147
00:04:49.911 --> 00:04:54.170
<v Speaker 1>say and maybe an analysis of the kinds of anxiety that are stopping them from</v>

148
00:04:54.171 --> 00:04:55.610
<v Speaker 1>going out and meeting people.</v>

149
00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.520
<v Speaker 1>And then you address those things practically one by one.</v>

150
00:04:58.521 --> 00:05:00.320
<v Speaker 1>You try to get the person to have some friends,</v>

151
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.710
<v Speaker 1>he tried to figure out how they can establish an intimate relationship.</v>

152
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.170
<v Speaker 1>You see if you can help them sort out their family,</v>

153
00:05:06.171 --> 00:05:08.060
<v Speaker 1>you do what you can about their employment.</v>

154
00:05:08.061 --> 00:05:12.380
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of that's only tangentially related to really in some sense to the</v>

155
00:05:12.381 --> 00:05:13.550
<v Speaker 1>structure of their psyche.</v>

156
00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.440
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things you'll see if you work as a clinician or as a counselor is</v>

157
00:05:18.441 --> 00:05:21.470
<v Speaker 1>that most of the time people come and see you because they have problems,</v>

158
00:05:21.471 --> 00:05:25.640
<v Speaker 1>not because they have psychological problems and those things are not that easy</v>

159
00:05:25.641 --> 00:05:26.540
<v Speaker 1>to distinguish.</v>

160
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:27.231
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

161
00:05:27.231 --> 00:05:28.880
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of the psychoanalytic idea,</v>

162
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:29.331
<v Speaker 1>sort of like,</v>

163
00:05:29.331 --> 00:05:30.920
<v Speaker 1>well if you just start your act together,</v>

164
00:05:30.921 --> 00:05:32.360
<v Speaker 1>everything would work out for you.</v>

165
00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:33.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

166
00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:34.243
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

167
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.963
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

168
00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:38.480
<v Speaker 1>there's some truth in that,</v>

169
00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:40.213
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

170
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.651
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

171
00:05:43.651 --> 00:05:46.650
<v Speaker 1>if you're 55 years old and you've just been laid off work</v>

172
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.990
<v Speaker 1>and maybe through no fault of your own,</v>

173
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.160
<v Speaker 1>it isn't obvious how much getting your act together,</v>

174
00:05:54.161 --> 00:05:56.670
<v Speaker 1>it's going to help you find another job because the,</v>

175
00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.940
<v Speaker 1>the actual problem that you're facing may have relatively little to do with you.</v>

176
00:06:01.941 --> 00:06:06.170
<v Speaker 1>And that would especially be the case if you're maybe on the bottom half of the</v>

177
00:06:06.171 --> 00:06:07.520
<v Speaker 1>intelligence distribution,</v>

178
00:06:07.521 --> 00:06:08.211
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

179
00:06:08.211 --> 00:06:12.980
<v Speaker 1>And so it isn't as easy for you just to go out and pick up new skills at the</v>

180
00:06:12.981 --> 00:06:13.880
<v Speaker 1>drop of a hat.</v>

181
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.850
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

182
00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:15.051
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

183
00:06:15.051 --> 00:06:18.110
<v Speaker 1>that gets harder as you get older because your Iq actually declines quite</v>

184
00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:19.550
<v Speaker 1>substantially as you get older.</v>

185
00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.420
<v Speaker 1>That that working or the the fluid intelligence part anyways,</v>

186
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.550
<v Speaker 1>exercise can keep that at bay.</v>

187
00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:25.971
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

188
00:06:25.971 --> 00:06:27.410
<v Speaker 1>it's the best way to keep that at bay.</v>
