1
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.280
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's take a look at the stories and</v>

2
00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:09.790
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look at the leading</v>
<v Speaker 1>figures.</v>

3
00:00:09.791 --> 00:00:10.870
<v Speaker 1>So we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

4
00:00:10.871 --> 00:00:14.500
<v Speaker 1>that the figure of Satan and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity is associated with a number</v>

5
00:00:14.501 --> 00:00:15.940
<v Speaker 1>of strange forms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

6
00:00:15.941 --> 00:00:20.260
<v Speaker 1>The first association we know of is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's associated with the,</v>

7
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.100
<v Speaker 1>with the dragon and in the garden of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eden,</v>

8
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.330
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a,</v>

9
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.600
<v Speaker 1>and so that there's a profound</v>
<v Speaker 1>ambivalence and Christianity about the</v>

10
00:00:28.601 --> 00:00:32.110
<v Speaker 1>meaning of the opening act of genesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because on the one hand you have,</v>

11
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.660
<v Speaker 1>when Adam and eve are still profoundly</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious,</v>

12
00:00:34.661 --> 00:00:38.590
<v Speaker 1>they don't suffer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're profoundly unconscious,</v>

13
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not self conscious,</v>

14
00:00:39.821 --> 00:00:42.610
<v Speaker 1>they're not aware of themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in many ways there's still animals.</v>

15
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.820
<v Speaker 1>So there's a gnostic line of</v>
<v Speaker 1>speculation.</v>

16
00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.890
<v Speaker 1>The gnostics were a Christian sect that</v>
<v Speaker 1>believed that a redemption could at</v>

17
00:00:50.891 --> 00:00:54.640
<v Speaker 1>least partly be attained by</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding rather than just faith.</v>

18
00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.020
<v Speaker 1>The gnostics believed that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the serpent that tempted Adam and eve</v>

19
00:00:59.021 --> 00:01:04.021
<v Speaker 1>towards self consciousness was a more</v>
<v Speaker 1>developed aspect of God than the God</v>

20
00:01:04.331 --> 00:01:06.130
<v Speaker 1>that had created Adam and Eve to begin</v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

21
00:01:06.131 --> 00:01:09.790
<v Speaker 1>Because the unconsciousness that</v>
<v Speaker 1>characterized Adam and eve was to</v>

22
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.690
<v Speaker 1>underdeveloped to be perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they had to be tempted forward</v>

23
00:01:13.691 --> 00:01:15.760
<v Speaker 1>into a more fully developed</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

24
00:01:15.761 --> 00:01:20.170
<v Speaker 1>And so although classical Christianity</v>
<v Speaker 1>associated the serpent in the tree with</v>

25
00:01:20.171 --> 00:01:21.790
<v Speaker 1>Lucifer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the bringer of light,</v>

26
00:01:21.791 --> 00:01:25.810
<v Speaker 1>who Satan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gnostic thread of reasoning said,</v>

27
00:01:25.811 --> 00:01:26.441
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

28
00:01:26.441 --> 00:01:29.650
<v Speaker 1>It's not that simple because yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>selfconsciousness makes you aware of</v>

29
00:01:29.651 --> 00:01:33.220
<v Speaker 1>death and vulnerability and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and knocks you out into the profane</v>

30
00:01:33.221 --> 00:01:34.780
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's an aspect of it,</v>

31
00:01:34.781 --> 00:01:38.080
<v Speaker 1>the kind of looks like enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know this already in your own</v>

32
00:01:38.081 --> 00:01:42.070
<v Speaker 1>lives because often when you believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>something and you're unconsciously</v>

33
00:01:42.071 --> 00:01:45.940
<v Speaker 1>convinced of the adequacy of that model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you find that it's not</v>

34
00:01:45.941 --> 00:01:47.020
<v Speaker 1>sufficient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

35
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.890
<v Speaker 1>And so you crumble in disappointment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put your trust in someone and you</v>

36
00:01:50.891 --> 00:01:53.380
<v Speaker 1>find out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say they're not worthy of that trust.</v>

37
00:01:53.381 --> 00:01:57.250
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the evidence that enlightens you</v>

38
00:01:57.251 --> 00:02:00.040
<v Speaker 1>breaks that frame of reference and makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>you collapse.</v>

39
00:02:00.041 --> 00:02:04.000
<v Speaker 1>You think that's a terrible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't help but feel that as a real</v>

40
00:02:04.001 --> 00:02:07.360
<v Speaker 1>betrayal and as an act even of evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then a year later,</v>

41
00:02:07.361 --> 00:02:09.040
<v Speaker 1>two years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might look back and think,</v>

42
00:02:09.041 --> 00:02:09.850
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.420
<v Speaker 1>I really needed that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really needed that lesson because as a</v>

44
00:02:13.421 --> 00:02:17.260
<v Speaker 1>consequence of learning that I'm much</v>
<v Speaker 1>more mature and much more likely to</v>

45
00:02:17.261 --> 00:02:21.850
<v Speaker 1>establish stable relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's easy to see that from one</v>

46
00:02:21.851 --> 00:02:24.280
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something can be terrible and then from</v>

47
00:02:24.281 --> 00:02:26.410
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might not be terrible at all.</v>

48
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.040
<v Speaker 1>And even in classic Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get this strange ambivalence about</v>

49
00:02:30.041 --> 00:02:33.010
<v Speaker 1>the events in genesis that runs</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like this.</v>

50
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.511
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

51
00:02:34.511 --> 00:02:37.810
<v Speaker 1>it was an act of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the most evil spirit,</v>

52
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.450
<v Speaker 1>the spirit of enlightenment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the spirit of rationality,</v>

53
00:02:40.451 --> 00:02:43.840
<v Speaker 1>or the bringer of light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lucifer to knock Adam and eve out of</v>

54
00:02:43.841 --> 00:02:47.500
<v Speaker 1>their transcendental unconsciousness and</v>
<v Speaker 1>to start history,</v>

55
00:02:47.501 --> 00:02:50.620
<v Speaker 1>it was an evil act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on the other hand,</v>

56
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.670
<v Speaker 1>it was also the precondition for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>later emergence of Christ.</v>

57
00:02:54.671 --> 00:02:56.350
<v Speaker 1>And as far as the Christians are</v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned,</v>

58
00:02:56.351 --> 00:03:00.490
<v Speaker 1>that's the greatest event in history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So without this initial opening act,</v>

59
00:03:00.491 --> 00:03:01.960
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this tragic opening act,</v>

60
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.220
<v Speaker 1>there'd be no reason for the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>redemptive story and therefore</v>

61
00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:09.250
<v Speaker 1>considered from the perspective of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>total story.</v>

62
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.810
<v Speaker 1>The opening tragedy cannot purely be</v>
<v Speaker 1>considered evil.</v>

63
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.440
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very complicated line of reasoning.</v>

64
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.750
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing you see here,</v>

65
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.040
<v Speaker 1>and I think this relates back to our</v>
<v Speaker 1>initial map is,</v>

66
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.980
<v Speaker 1>and this also helps you understand the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way people think.</v>

67
00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:31.981
<v Speaker 1>Now I said already that it's real easy</v>
<v Speaker 1>to confuse tragedy and evil,</v>

68
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

69
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.840
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what that means is that it's real</v>

70
00:03:34.841 --> 00:03:39.280
<v Speaker 1>easy to confuse the negative aspect of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unknown with evil and likewise it's</v>

71
00:03:39.281 --> 00:03:42.340
<v Speaker 1>very easy to confuse the negative aspect</v>
<v Speaker 1>of culture with evil,</v>

72
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.640
<v Speaker 1>your own culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tear radical aspect of it or the</v>

73
00:03:45.641 --> 00:03:48.340
<v Speaker 1>culture of other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's very easy for,</v>

74
00:03:48.341 --> 00:03:51.130
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for us to demonize the foreigner and</v>

75
00:03:51.131 --> 00:03:55.330
<v Speaker 1>that's basically because there's a part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of our mind that presumes that all</v>

76
00:03:55.331 --> 00:03:59.440
<v Speaker 1>things that strike us negatively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all things that produce negative emotion</v>

77
00:03:59.441 --> 00:04:02.620
<v Speaker 1>on our part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like fear are the same thing.</v>

78
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.010
<v Speaker 1>So there's a a blurry category of evil</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all terrible natural things,</v>

79
00:04:08.351 --> 00:04:11.950
<v Speaker 1>all terrible social things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then whatever nastiness the</v>

80
00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:14.890
<v Speaker 1>individual can generate among</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>

81
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.040
<v Speaker 1>it's much more useful to draw a clear</v>
<v Speaker 1>distinction between these different</v>

82
00:04:21.041 --> 00:04:25.750
<v Speaker 1>categories because that clarity of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought can help you,</v>

83
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.210
<v Speaker 1>can help you focus in most specifically</v>
<v Speaker 1>on those things that the individual is</v>

84
00:04:31.211 --> 00:04:34.840
<v Speaker 1>responsible for in terms of turning the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world to waste.</v>

85
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.640
<v Speaker 1>So Milton says this figure of Satan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lucifer,</v>

86
00:04:39.641 --> 00:04:42.400
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the light bringer always associated with</v>

87
00:04:42.401 --> 00:04:45.310
<v Speaker 1>rationality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Milton presents him as a remarkable</v>

88
00:04:45.311 --> 00:04:46.031
<v Speaker 1>creature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

89
00:04:46.031 --> 00:04:49.720
<v Speaker 1>He's the head highest angel in God's</v>
<v Speaker 1>heavenly hierarchy.</v>

90
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.820
<v Speaker 1>He's Christ elder brother in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

91
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.350
<v Speaker 1>in a similar mythological vein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the most powerful angel that ever</v>

92
00:04:56.351 --> 00:04:58.930
<v Speaker 1>lived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at least in the opening stages of</v>

93
00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:01.330
<v Speaker 1>this act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Satan is presented as something</v>

94
00:05:01.331 --> 00:05:03.370
<v Speaker 1>absolutely remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

95
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.880
<v Speaker 1>the problem is here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his very remarkable illness starts to</v>

96
00:05:06.881 --> 00:05:11.380
<v Speaker 1>work against him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what happens is that as he grows in</v>

97
00:05:11.381 --> 00:05:15.580
<v Speaker 1>power and strength in this heavenly</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy starts to become convinced</v>

98
00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:20.020
<v Speaker 1>that the omniscient himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

99
00:05:20.021 --> 00:05:23.350
<v Speaker 1>that transcendent figure is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is unnecessary.</v>

100
00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.650
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is that whatever Satan</v>
<v Speaker 1>represents decides because of his own</v>

101
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.830
<v Speaker 1>pride,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his own belief in his own sufficiency,</v>

102
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:38.100
<v Speaker 1>that the transcendent can be eradicated</v>
<v Speaker 1>from consideration the way Milton</v>

103
00:05:38.651 --> 00:05:41.560
<v Speaker 1>presents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is as a revolution in heaven,</v>

104
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:42.453
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally.</v>

105
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.600
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that the story is something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>

106
00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Kelley,</v>

107
00:05:49.331 --> 00:05:54.331
<v Speaker 1>way back in like 1955 noted that what</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings like more than anything</v>

108
00:05:54.401 --> 00:05:57.960
<v Speaker 1>else really when you get right down to</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is to be right.</v>

109
00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.060
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

110
00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:01.650
<v Speaker 1>it's a pain to be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

111
00:06:01.651 --> 00:06:04.170
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the little structure that you're</v>

112
00:06:04.171 --> 00:06:09.171
<v Speaker 1>using to conjure up the world has to</v>
<v Speaker 1>dissolve and then you have to do a lot</v>

113
00:06:09.601 --> 00:06:13.500
<v Speaker 1>of really aggravating work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exploratory work and creative work to</v>

114
00:06:13.501 --> 00:06:16.140
<v Speaker 1>put it back together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And during the time,</v>

115
00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.620
<v Speaker 1>before you put it back together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're flooded with negative</v>

116
00:06:19.621 --> 00:06:20.910
<v Speaker 1>motivational states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

117
00:06:20.911 --> 00:06:23.850
<v Speaker 1>You don't know which way is up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphorically speaking.</v>

118
00:06:23.851 --> 00:06:27.090
<v Speaker 1>So we don't like to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't like not to be.</v>

119
00:06:27.091 --> 00:06:27.720
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

120
00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.190
<v Speaker 1>and so what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

121
00:06:29.191 --> 00:06:33.000
<v Speaker 1>psychologists know that people have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very strong confirmatory bias,</v>

122
00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.420
<v Speaker 1>which basically means that if you bring</v>
<v Speaker 1>a frame of reference to bear on the</v>

123
00:06:36.421 --> 00:06:39.000
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability is very high,</v>

124
00:06:39.001 --> 00:06:43.650
<v Speaker 1>that you will look for confirming</v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence and you will discount</v>

125
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.640
<v Speaker 1>disconfirming evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the other thing that is</v>

126
00:06:47.641 --> 00:06:51.690
<v Speaker 1>characteristic of great figures of evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Satan is their tendency to lie,</v>

127
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Satan is prince of the lie.</v>

128
00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:54.990
<v Speaker 1>Now what does that mean exactly?</v>

129
00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:58.713
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

130
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:05.070
<v Speaker 1>So Tsl Eliot wrote this poem called the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cocktail hour.</v>

131
00:07:05.411 --> 00:07:07.660
<v Speaker 1>He talks about this woman goes in for</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychiatric treatment.</v>

132
00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:10.150
<v Speaker 1>The woman says to the psychiatrist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling Ya,</v>

133
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.580
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really hope there's something wrong with</v>

134
00:07:12.581 --> 00:07:15.040
<v Speaker 1>me because I'm having a miserable time</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

135
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.800
<v Speaker 1>And as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's only two options here.</v>

136
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.370
<v Speaker 1>Either I'm okay and I'm having a</v>
<v Speaker 1>miserable time because the world is</v>

137
00:07:21.371 --> 00:07:24.490
<v Speaker 1>terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which case there's nothing I can do</v>

138
00:07:24.491 --> 00:07:27.070
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or there's something wrong with me at</v>

139
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.100
<v Speaker 1>some level of analysis that I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>really comprehend.</v>

140
00:07:30.101 --> 00:07:34.690
<v Speaker 1>And although that's a painful option,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really hoping it's true because if</v>

141
00:07:34.691 --> 00:07:37.810
<v Speaker 1>there's something wrong with me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly I can fix it and if there's</v>

142
00:07:37.811 --> 00:07:39.340
<v Speaker 1>something wrong with the structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

143
00:07:39.341 --> 00:07:41.890
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's there to do about that?</v>

144
00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:45.080
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

145
00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.590
<v Speaker 1>Often what you see in psychotherapy is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>battle between those two perspectives</v>

146
00:07:48.591 --> 00:07:52.760
<v Speaker 1>going on in the minds of the client that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the client is in a situation where</v>

147
00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:58.300
<v Speaker 1>they're repetitively facing tragedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a specific viewpoint about the</v>

148
00:07:58.941 --> 00:08:00.170
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like their viewpoint might be,</v>

149
00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:01.940
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes right down to it,</v>

150
00:08:01.941 --> 00:08:05.060
<v Speaker 1>you really can't trust other people and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have all sorts of reasons for</v>

151
00:08:05.061 --> 00:08:07.700
<v Speaker 1>believing that they were abused as</v>
<v Speaker 1>children or they've had a bad</v>

152
00:08:07.701 --> 00:08:10.340
<v Speaker 1>developmental history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a number of relationships that haven't</v>

153
00:08:10.341 --> 00:08:12.770
<v Speaker 1>gone well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have all the facts at their</v>

154
00:08:12.771 --> 00:08:15.140
<v Speaker 1>disposal to justify that particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

155
00:08:15.141 --> 00:08:19.130
<v Speaker 1>but the truth of the matter is is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as they hold on to that belief</v>

156
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:21.860
<v Speaker 1>and won't let it go and and no wonder</v>
<v Speaker 1>they won't,</v>

157
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.490
<v Speaker 1>they're going to continue to suffer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of what you're always doing to</v>

158
00:08:25.491 --> 00:08:26.720
<v Speaker 1>someone in therapy saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

159
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:28.850
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got a pretty coherent view of the</v>

160
00:08:28.851 --> 00:08:31.760
<v Speaker 1>world and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I can understand why you'd like to</v>

161
00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:34.700
<v Speaker 1>cram the whole world into that coherent</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

162
00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.580
<v Speaker 1>But the truth of the matter is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as you hold onto that and won't</v>

163
00:08:37.581 --> 00:08:38.750
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

164
00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:41.390
<v Speaker 1>we'll go through this terrible period of</v>
<v Speaker 1>disillusion.</v>

165
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:45.950
<v Speaker 1>It's always going to produce the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>tragic consequences.</v>

166
00:08:45.951 --> 00:08:48.380
<v Speaker 1>So as long as you hold onto your belief</v>
<v Speaker 1>rigidly,</v>

167
00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.350
<v Speaker 1>everything around you is going to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>from bad to worse.</v>
