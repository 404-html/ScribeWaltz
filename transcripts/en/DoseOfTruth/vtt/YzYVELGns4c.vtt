1
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.540
<v Speaker 1>Deals with alcoholism and at the biological level,</v>

2
00:00:11.541 --> 00:00:15.800
<v Speaker 1>that's what I did my phd thesis on and much of my early published papers where I</v>

3
00:00:15.801 --> 00:00:19.580
<v Speaker 1>learned about brain function because alcohol affects every part of the brain.</v>

4
00:00:19.581 --> 00:00:21.140
<v Speaker 1>So I learned a lot about the brain.</v>

5
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.570
<v Speaker 1>What prompted my interest in that area.</v>

6
00:00:23.571 --> 00:00:24.590
<v Speaker 1>And you're a parent shift,</v>

7
00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:26.360
<v Speaker 1>two issues clustered around personality.</v>

8
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.710
<v Speaker 1>While I was always interested in motivation for drug and alcohol abuse,</v>

9
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.650
<v Speaker 1>you know what it was the drove people to use drugs of,</v>

10
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.200
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

11
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.410
<v Speaker 1>of abuse,</v>

12
00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:37.244
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

13
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.233
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

14
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.720
<v Speaker 1>I got the opportunity to study at Miguel under Dr Robert Peel,</v>

15
00:00:41.721 --> 00:00:45.830
<v Speaker 1>who was an excellent supervisor and he was deeply involved with,</v>

16
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.640
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

17
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.890
<v Speaker 1>drug and alcohol abuse research,</v>

18
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.140
<v Speaker 1>looking at motivation for alcoholism.</v>

19
00:00:51.141 --> 00:00:53.150
<v Speaker 1>And he offered me a position in his lab and,</v>

20
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.100
<v Speaker 1>and that was what he was working on.</v>

21
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:55.581
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

22
00:00:55.581 --> 00:00:55.761
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

23
00:00:55.761 --> 00:00:58.100
<v Speaker 1>that was one of my cardinal interests,</v>

24
00:00:58.101 --> 00:00:59.690
<v Speaker 1>although perhaps not my,</v>

25
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.060
<v Speaker 1>my fundamental interest,</v>

26
00:01:02.061 --> 00:01:06.440
<v Speaker 1>which even at that point had to do with motivation for totalitarianism and the</v>

27
00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:08.330
<v Speaker 1>Commission of atrocity in the service of,</v>

28
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.920
<v Speaker 1>of group belief.</v>

29
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.203
<v Speaker 1>But I thought,</v>

30
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.601
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

31
00:01:11.601 --> 00:01:16.601
<v Speaker 1>it's a broad topic and I could learn a lot about biology and neurobiology as a</v>

32
00:01:16.671 --> 00:01:19.130
<v Speaker 1>consequence of working on something that was so biological.</v>

33
00:01:19.131 --> 00:01:19.910
<v Speaker 1>So my,</v>

34
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.510
<v Speaker 1>my early work in psychology was extremely biologically oriented and it was</v>

35
00:01:23.511 --> 00:01:24.740
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably useful.</v>

36
00:01:24.741 --> 00:01:28.250
<v Speaker 1>I learned a lot from the animal experimentalists in particular people like</v>

37
00:01:28.251 --> 00:01:30.830
<v Speaker 1>Jeffrey Gray and later Jaak Panksepp.</v>

38
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

39
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.950
<v Speaker 1>I have a reading list at Jordan B.</v>

40
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.340
<v Speaker 1>Peterson Dotcom that outlines some of those emotional,</v>

41
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.320
<v Speaker 1>so those books on emotional neuroscience.</v>

42
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.633
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

43
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.830
<v Speaker 1>what was my,</v>

44
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.090
<v Speaker 1>why did I shift?</v>

45
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.190
<v Speaker 1>Well there was a variety of reasons.</v>

46
00:01:46.191 --> 00:01:51.191
<v Speaker 1>One was that the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and alcoholism and I AAA,</v>

47
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.770
<v Speaker 1>which funded grant research in the United States essentially made the corn of</v>

48
00:01:56.871 --> 00:01:58.550
<v Speaker 1>research I was doing with Robert Peale.</v>

49
00:01:58.551 --> 00:01:59.384
<v Speaker 1>Impossible.</v>

50
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.670
<v Speaker 1>And it's part of the consequence.</v>

51
00:02:01.671 --> 00:02:04.490
<v Speaker 1>I think this is one of the things that the universities are doing so terribly</v>

52
00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:04.821
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>

53
00:02:04.821 --> 00:02:09.821
<v Speaker 1>is the ethics committees made our research impossible both to fund and to</v>

54
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:11.180
<v Speaker 1>implement.</v>

55
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.013
<v Speaker 1>So here's why.</v>

56
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.300
<v Speaker 1>So we were bringing people into the lab.</v>

57
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.120
<v Speaker 1>So here's who we pick for subjects.</v>

58
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.730
<v Speaker 1>If you are going to be a subject in one of our experiments,</v>

59
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.910
<v Speaker 1>you had to be a young man and you had to have an alcoholic father and an</v>

60
00:02:25.971 --> 00:02:30.380
<v Speaker 1>alcoholic grandfather and at least one other first or second degree male</v>

61
00:02:30.381 --> 00:02:31.640
<v Speaker 1>alcoholic relative.</v>

62
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.213
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

63
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.480
<v Speaker 1>I hope I'm back again.</v>

64
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:37.071
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

65
00:02:37.071 --> 00:02:40.430
<v Speaker 1>my software updated and obviously the update has a bug,</v>

66
00:02:40.431 --> 00:02:41.750
<v Speaker 1>so that's rather annoying.</v>

67
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.833
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

68
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:44.720
<v Speaker 1>apologies for that.</v>

69
00:02:44.721 --> 00:02:45.554
<v Speaker 1>Once again.</v>

70
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.740
<v Speaker 1>So back to the alcoholism discussion.</v>

71
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.353
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

72
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.553
<v Speaker 1>where was I?</v>

73
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:52.423
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>

74
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.090
<v Speaker 1>So we would get these subjects.</v>

75
00:02:56.091 --> 00:02:56.301
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

76
00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:57.320
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned who they were,</v>

77
00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.270
<v Speaker 1>they were young men who weren't alcoholic,</v>

78
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.790
<v Speaker 1>but who drank socially,</v>

79
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.890
<v Speaker 1>who had an alcoholic father,</v>

80
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.900
<v Speaker 1>an alcoholic grandfather,</v>

81
00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:07.390
<v Speaker 1>and at least one other male alcoholic relative.</v>

82
00:03:07.391 --> 00:03:09.100
<v Speaker 1>Now why did we pick subjects like that?</v>

83
00:03:09.101 --> 00:03:09.251
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

84
00:03:09.251 --> 00:03:13.360
<v Speaker 1>we knew alcoholism ran in families and we couldn't really study its transmission</v>

85
00:03:13.361 --> 00:03:17.620
<v Speaker 1>and women because if you're a female alcoholic and you drink when you have a</v>

86
00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:18.490
<v Speaker 1>child in Utero,</v>

87
00:03:18.491 --> 00:03:23.320
<v Speaker 1>then the child can have fetal alcohol syndrome and whatever abnormalities in</v>

88
00:03:23.321 --> 00:03:28.321
<v Speaker 1>psychophysiological response or psychopathologies might be associated with,</v>

89
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:29.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

90
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.850
<v Speaker 1>their alcoholism can easily be masked by the presence of fetal alcohol syndrome.</v>

91
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.570
<v Speaker 1>So we couldn't use women and besides alcoholism is a problem that fundamentally</v>

92
00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:40.810
<v Speaker 1>characterized as men.</v>

93
00:03:40.811 --> 00:03:42.220
<v Speaker 1>Although there are female alcoholics,</v>

94
00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:45.700
<v Speaker 1>I think it's four to one if I remember correctly from from those days,</v>

95
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.410
<v Speaker 1>it's four to one male to female,</v>

96
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.393
<v Speaker 1>so it was,</v>

97
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.550
<v Speaker 1>we know when we thought if we concentrated on those who had the highest</v>

98
00:03:51.551 --> 00:03:55.150
<v Speaker 1>probability of developing alcoholism because of their loaded family history that</v>

99
00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:58.900
<v Speaker 1>we could shed some light on the mechanisms associated with alcoholism and that</v>

100
00:03:58.901 --> 00:04:00.400
<v Speaker 1>would be useful for men and for women.</v>

101
00:04:00.401 --> 00:04:02.470
<v Speaker 1>So we studied sons of male alcoholics,</v>

102
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.140
<v Speaker 1>sons of multigenerational male alcoholics.</v>

103
00:04:05.141 --> 00:04:06.160
<v Speaker 1>Those were our target group,</v>

104
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.050
<v Speaker 1>very hard populations to find.</v>

105
00:04:08.051 --> 00:04:12.340
<v Speaker 1>We have people hired full time to do nothing but find us research subjects and</v>

106
00:04:12.341 --> 00:04:16.780
<v Speaker 1>so we did relatively small end studies because we were lucky if we could gather</v>

107
00:04:16.781 --> 00:04:20.500
<v Speaker 1>four or five subjects a month in the Montreal urban area.</v>

108
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.761
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

109
00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:23.740
<v Speaker 1>we did discover a lot about alcoholism.</v>

110
00:04:23.741 --> 00:04:24.970
<v Speaker 1>We discovered for example,</v>

111
00:04:24.971 --> 00:04:29.080
<v Speaker 1>that if people with this multigenerational history,</v>

112
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.000
<v Speaker 1>a substantial proportion of them,</v>

113
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.280
<v Speaker 1>if they drank enough alcohol to move their blood level up above 0.08 which is</v>

114
00:04:36.281 --> 00:04:37.750
<v Speaker 1>legal intoxication level.</v>

115
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.810
<v Speaker 1>And if they did that relatively short period of time,</v>

116
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.750
<v Speaker 1>then their heart rate would increase above,</v>

117
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.710
<v Speaker 1>I think the average was about 12 beats per minute compared to the standard</v>

118
00:04:47.711 --> 00:04:48.490
<v Speaker 1>control of,</v>

119
00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.370
<v Speaker 1>of zero zero or one or two.</v>

120
00:04:51.371 --> 00:04:52.420
<v Speaker 1>It was is very low.</v>

121
00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:53.351
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

122
00:04:53.351 --> 00:04:57.130
<v Speaker 1>and then we did figure out over time our whole team that that seemed to be a</v>

123
00:04:57.131 --> 00:05:02.131
<v Speaker 1>consequence of susceptibility to alcohol's effect on opioid production in the</v>

124
00:05:02.321 --> 00:05:02.651
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

125
00:05:02.651 --> 00:05:03.640
<v Speaker 1>And Secondary,</v>

126
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:04.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

127
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.250
<v Speaker 1>opioid effects on dopamine,</v>

128
00:05:06.251 --> 00:05:10.570
<v Speaker 1>which is both opiates and dopamine are primarily primary reward chemical.</v>

129
00:05:10.571 --> 00:05:14.140
<v Speaker 1>So it looked to us like people with multigenerational family histories of</v>

130
00:05:14.141 --> 00:05:16.750
<v Speaker 1>alcoholism got an opiate response from alcohol.</v>

131
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.890
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

132
00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:22.060
<v Speaker 1>but we had to get people drunk in order to find this response.</v>

133
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.800
<v Speaker 1>And it turned out that 0.08,</v>

134
00:05:23.801 --> 00:05:27.430
<v Speaker 1>which was the legal limit at that time for driving was approximately the place</v>

135
00:05:27.431 --> 00:05:31.570
<v Speaker 1>where we saw the psychophysiological effects and also saw fairly pronounced</v>

136
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.590
<v Speaker 1>cognitive and motor effects of alcohol because we also studied that.</v>

137
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.690
<v Speaker 1>So now to bring,</v>

138
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.380
<v Speaker 1>we bring people into the lab and we'd give them three large shots of alcohol</v>

139
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.910
<v Speaker 1>that they consumed in 10 minutes.</v>

140
00:05:42.911 --> 00:05:44.440
<v Speaker 1>We use laboratory alcohol,</v>

141
00:05:44.441 --> 00:05:46.880
<v Speaker 1>which was I think 95% pure alcohol,</v>

142
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.190
<v Speaker 1>usually put it in orange juice.</v>

143
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.553
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

144
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.220
<v Speaker 1>and so people would be,</v>

145
00:05:51.221 --> 00:05:51.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

146
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:52.780
<v Speaker 1>reasonably intoxicated.</v>

147
00:05:52.781 --> 00:05:56.500
<v Speaker 1>And then we would let them sober up until they were at 0.04,</v>

148
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.460
<v Speaker 1>which is half legal intoxication,</v>

149
00:05:58.461 --> 00:05:59.450
<v Speaker 1>which we thought was useful.</v>

150
00:05:59.451 --> 00:06:02.090
<v Speaker 1>And then we put them in a cabin and they'd go home and we,</v>

151
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.661
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

152
00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:06.980
<v Speaker 1>we had our odd mishap now and then someone would throw up and that was,</v>

153
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.750
<v Speaker 1>well I'm at least getting better at fixing it when it screws up now.</v>

154
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.310
<v Speaker 1>So um,</v>

155
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.620
<v Speaker 1>you know when it anyways,</v>

156
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:22.130
<v Speaker 1>now and then we would have somebody who would be becoming all in the lab and</v>

157
00:06:22.131 --> 00:06:23.150
<v Speaker 1>that was always unpleasant.</v>

158
00:06:23.151 --> 00:06:27.140
<v Speaker 1>But then we also let people sober up and it actually takes quite a long time to</v>

159
00:06:27.141 --> 00:06:28.790
<v Speaker 1>go from point a to 0.04,</v>

160
00:06:28.791 --> 00:06:30.980
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're a big guy cause your,</v>

161
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.500
<v Speaker 1>your dose of alcohol is proportionate to your body weight.</v>

162
00:06:33.501 --> 00:06:36.260
<v Speaker 1>And so we used to have people wait in the lab for a couple of hours.</v>

163
00:06:36.261 --> 00:06:36.591
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

164
00:06:36.591 --> 00:06:41.120
<v Speaker 1>and they were not very happy necessarily about having to wait before we paid</v>

165
00:06:41.121 --> 00:06:41.954
<v Speaker 1>them and so forth.</v>

166
00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:42.910
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

167
00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.800
<v Speaker 1>and if we didn't treat them extraordinarily well,</v>

168
00:06:45.801 --> 00:06:46.611
<v Speaker 1>which we tried to do,</v>

169
00:06:46.611 --> 00:06:49.550
<v Speaker 1>then of course they were much less likely to come back and participate in</v>

170
00:06:49.551 --> 00:06:50.384
<v Speaker 1>another study.</v>

171
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.330
<v Speaker 1>And since it was very difficult to get research subjects,</v>

172
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.020
<v Speaker 1>then we wanted to treat them very well apart from the fact that we would have</v>

173
00:06:57.021 --> 00:06:57.920
<v Speaker 1>done that anyways.</v>

174
00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:59.143
<v Speaker 1>But then,</v>

175
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:00.260
<v Speaker 1>and I AAA said,</v>

176
00:07:00.261 --> 00:07:00.381
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

177
00:07:00.381 --> 00:07:04.070
<v Speaker 1>you can't let your research subjects go home until they have a blood alcohol</v>

178
00:07:04.071 --> 00:07:04.821
<v Speaker 1>level of point.</v>

179
00:07:04.821 --> 00:07:06.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh two was like,</v>

180
00:07:06.231 --> 00:07:08.090
<v Speaker 1>we would have had to have people in our lab,</v>

181
00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:08.781
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

182
00:07:08.781 --> 00:07:09.810
<v Speaker 1>sobering up for</v>

183
00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:15.040
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

184
00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.450
<v Speaker 1>For six to eight hours.</v>

185
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.440
<v Speaker 1>This keeps happening.</v>

186
00:07:17.441 --> 00:07:18.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm very sorry about this,</v>

187
00:07:18.701 --> 00:07:19.534
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>

188
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:22.453
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

189
00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to say about it except that that's a consequence of software</v>

190
00:07:26.381 --> 00:07:27.430
<v Speaker 1>updates I suppose.</v>

191
00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:28.923
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

192
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:33.903
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>

193
00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:37.930
<v Speaker 1>so that made it impossible because we just couldn't keep people in the lab for</v>

194
00:07:37.931 --> 00:07:38.351
<v Speaker 1>that long.</v>

195
00:07:38.351 --> 00:07:41.050
<v Speaker 1>All it did was annoyed them to death and then they hated us and they,</v>

196
00:07:41.051 --> 00:07:41.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

197
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.590
<v Speaker 1>people would get quite irritable and upset and no bloody wonder.</v>

198
00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:46.270
<v Speaker 1>So then also,</v>

199
00:07:46.271 --> 00:07:50.230
<v Speaker 1>and I AAA decided that half our subjects had to be women or we couldn't get</v>

200
00:07:50.231 --> 00:07:51.064
<v Speaker 1>funding.</v>

201
00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:52.293
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

202
00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:52.661
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

203
00:07:52.661 --> 00:07:53.860
<v Speaker 1>our subjects couldn't be women.</v>

204
00:07:53.861 --> 00:07:58.420
<v Speaker 1>It was impossible to do the kind of research that we were doing with women for</v>

205
00:07:58.421 --> 00:07:59.740
<v Speaker 1>the reasons that I just don't like.</v>

206
00:07:59.741 --> 00:07:59.891
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

207
00:07:59.891 --> 00:08:00.724
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

208
00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:01.893
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

209
00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:05.860
<v Speaker 1>alcoholism doesn't affect women as much as it affects men.</v>

210
00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:09.850
<v Speaker 1>Depression and anxiety tend to affect women more than it's perfectly reasonable</v>

211
00:08:09.851 --> 00:08:10.661
<v Speaker 1>to study those things.</v>

212
00:08:10.661 --> 00:08:11.920
<v Speaker 1>But that isn't what we were doing.</v>

213
00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:12.821
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

214
00:08:12.821 --> 00:08:13.654
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

215
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.440
<v Speaker 1>and then we couldn't do multigenerational studies for,</v>

216
00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:22.520
<v Speaker 1>for genetic predisposition with women because of the fetal alcohol syndrome</v>

217
00:08:22.521 --> 00:08:23.354
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

218
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:24.201
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

219
00:08:24.201 --> 00:08:24.861
<v Speaker 1>this was something,</v>

220
00:08:24.861 --> 00:08:26.540
<v Speaker 1>I think this came in under the Clintons,</v>

221
00:08:26.541 --> 00:08:31.541
<v Speaker 1>this re requirement for absolute gender equality in,</v>

222
00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:33.140
<v Speaker 1>in subject selection.</v>

223
00:08:33.141 --> 00:08:36.080
<v Speaker 1>And they didn't give a damn if that meant that there were certain kinds of</v>

224
00:08:36.081 --> 00:08:38.120
<v Speaker 1>research that just couldn't be done anymore.</v>

225
00:08:38.121 --> 00:08:39.950
<v Speaker 1>And so I had to stop doing it.</v>

226
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:44.000
<v Speaker 1>And no one's really doing that kind of research anymore because it's just too</v>

227
00:08:44.001 --> 00:08:44.834
<v Speaker 1>difficult.</v>

228
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:47.780
<v Speaker 1>It's like it was always a pain because it was really hard to get the subjects</v>

229
00:08:47.781 --> 00:08:51.560
<v Speaker 1>and then you had to get people quite intoxicated and then you had to deal with</v>

230
00:08:51.561 --> 00:08:54.500
<v Speaker 1>them when they were drunk and you had to do your psychophysiological recording</v>

231
00:08:54.501 --> 00:08:55.410
<v Speaker 1>and all that of thing.</v>

232
00:08:55.411 --> 00:08:57.390
<v Speaker 1>And then they had to sober up and you know,</v>

233
00:08:57.391 --> 00:08:58.530
<v Speaker 1>it was complicated.</v>

234
00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:00.720
<v Speaker 1>Clinical research is unbelievably,</v>

235
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:02.730
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably complicated and difficult.</v>

236
00:09:02.731 --> 00:09:03.451
<v Speaker 1>And then yeah,</v>

237
00:09:03.451 --> 00:09:05.610
<v Speaker 1>I would like to more restrictions to it and people just go,</v>

238
00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:06.001
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

239
00:09:06.001 --> 00:09:06.361
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

240
00:09:06.361 --> 00:09:07.081
<v Speaker 1>well we,</v>

241
00:09:07.081 --> 00:09:11.190
<v Speaker 1>I guess we won't study the psychophysiological consequences of alcohol anymore</v>

242
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.200
<v Speaker 1>or so people would use low doses,</v>

243
00:09:13.201 --> 00:09:13.441
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

244
00:09:13.441 --> 00:09:17.490
<v Speaker 1>and only get their subject's blood alcohol level up to like 0.02 or 0.03 but</v>

245
00:09:17.491 --> 00:09:21.090
<v Speaker 1>that's completely irrelevant because alcohol doesn't have much of a</v>

246
00:09:21.091 --> 00:09:22.130
<v Speaker 1>physiological effect.</v>

247
00:09:22.131 --> 00:09:22.231
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

248
00:09:22.231 --> 00:09:23.190
<v Speaker 1>those low doses.</v>

249
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:27.990
<v Speaker 1>And so while this is one of the things that made me absolutely despise ethics</v>

250
00:09:27.991 --> 00:09:28.411
<v Speaker 1>committees,</v>

251
00:09:28.411 --> 00:09:31.620
<v Speaker 1>and I believe that the proliferation of ethics committees is one of the reasons</v>

252
00:09:31.621 --> 00:09:34.380
<v Speaker 1>that university research human research is,</v>

253
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.190
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

254
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:36.240
<v Speaker 1>is doing badly.</v>

255
00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:38.280
<v Speaker 1>Psychological research is doing badly.</v>

256
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:39.420
<v Speaker 1>There's a variety of reasons,</v>

257
00:09:39.421 --> 00:09:40.530
<v Speaker 1>but that's certainly one of them.</v>

258
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.480
<v Speaker 1>So I was interested,</v>

259
00:09:42.481 --> 00:09:43.830
<v Speaker 1>sorry this is a very long answer,</v>

260
00:09:43.831 --> 00:09:45.900
<v Speaker 1>but I was interested in personality as well.</v>

261
00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:46.320
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

262
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.700
<v Speaker 1>because I was a clinical psychologist and I'd read Freud and Jung and Adler and</v>

263
00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:53.010
<v Speaker 1>all the great clinicians of the 20th century.</v>

264
00:09:53.011 --> 00:09:55.950
<v Speaker 1>And when I went to Harvard I was offered,</v>

265
00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:56.851
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

266
00:09:56.851 --> 00:09:57.061
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

267
00:09:57.061 --> 00:09:57.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

268
00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:58.800
<v Speaker 1>when you're a new faculty member,</v>

269
00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:02.610
<v Speaker 1>there's usually a set course that they require you to teach.</v>

270
00:10:02.611 --> 00:10:03.810
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the core courses.</v>

271
00:10:03.811 --> 00:10:05.760
<v Speaker 1>And then you have some freedom with your other courses.</v>

272
00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:10.860
<v Speaker 1>And so I said I'd teach personality and then I got more and more and we were</v>

273
00:10:10.861 --> 00:10:14.580
<v Speaker 1>looking at personality models with the alcoholism research too.</v>

274
00:10:14.581 --> 00:10:15.211
<v Speaker 1>At that point,</v>

275
00:10:15.211 --> 00:10:17.160
<v Speaker 1>the big five was starting to establish itself.</v>

276
00:10:17.161 --> 00:10:19.980
<v Speaker 1>And I wasn't much of an admirer of the big five because I like,</v>

277
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.740
<v Speaker 1>while I like theories as well as empirical research.</v>

278
00:10:22.741 --> 00:10:24.000
<v Speaker 1>And I thought the big five,</v>

279
00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:25.650
<v Speaker 1>while there was just no theory at all,</v>

280
00:10:25.651 --> 00:10:27.300
<v Speaker 1>it was just brute force empiricism,</v>

281
00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:29.820
<v Speaker 1>but well,</v>

282
00:10:29.821 --> 00:10:31.140
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

283
00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:33.240
<v Speaker 1>that data eventually became convincing.</v>

284
00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.070
<v Speaker 1>And as I got more and more interested in,</v>

285
00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:36.413
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

286
00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:39.210
<v Speaker 1>in personality,</v>

287
00:10:39.211 --> 00:10:44.010
<v Speaker 1>I got more and more interested in the use of personality and other psychometric</v>

288
00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:48.900
<v Speaker 1>technologies to predict things like academic and creative success.</v>

289
00:10:48.901 --> 00:10:51.570
<v Speaker 1>You see it at McGill,</v>

290
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:55.860
<v Speaker 1>my Bob and I and a variety of other people were using,</v>

291
00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:57.000
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

292
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.780
<v Speaker 1>psychological tests of various sorts to predict things like alcoholism and</v>

293
00:11:00.781 --> 00:11:02.050
<v Speaker 1>antisocial personality.</v>

294
00:11:02.051 --> 00:11:05.760
<v Speaker 1>So we could use the big five and neuropsychological tests,</v>

295
00:11:05.761 --> 00:11:07.830
<v Speaker 1>tests of Dorsolateral prefrontal function,</v>

296
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:09.330
<v Speaker 1>at least in principle,</v>

297
00:11:09.331 --> 00:11:12.840
<v Speaker 1>to predict to some degree who might be susceptible to the development of</v>

298
00:11:12.841 --> 00:11:14.070
<v Speaker 1>antisocial personality.</v>

299
00:11:14.071 --> 00:11:15.000
<v Speaker 1>And then when I went to Harvard,</v>

300
00:11:15.001 --> 00:11:15.301
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

301
00:11:15.301 --> 00:11:15.481
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

302
00:11:15.481 --> 00:11:15.661
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

303
00:11:15.661 --> 00:11:20.661
<v Speaker 1>maybe we could use those tests to predict who was going to be good at things as</v>

304
00:11:20.671 --> 00:11:22.080
<v Speaker 1>well as who was going to be bad.</v>

305
00:11:22.081 --> 00:11:22.321
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

306
00:11:22.321 --> 00:11:24.570
<v Speaker 1>the people who are creative are the people who were,</v>

307
00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:25.530
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

308
00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:26.490
<v Speaker 1>academically,</v>

309
00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:27.210
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

310
00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:30.570
<v Speaker 1>outstanding or people who did well as managers and administrators and</v>

311
00:11:30.571 --> 00:11:33.730
<v Speaker 1>corporations might do well on personality tests and,</v>

312
00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:38.580
<v Speaker 1>and neuropsychological tests that assess dorsolateral prefrontal functions.</v>

313
00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:39.810
<v Speaker 1>That's higher order cognition.</v>

314
00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:44.370
<v Speaker 1>So we started to put together test batteries that assessed that and that was</v>

315
00:11:44.371 --> 00:11:45.360
<v Speaker 1>fascinating research.</v>

316
00:11:45.361 --> 00:11:46.740
<v Speaker 1>I did that with Daniel Higgins,</v>

317
00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:47.880
<v Speaker 1>who's the partner,</v>

318
00:11:47.881 --> 00:11:51.210
<v Speaker 1>my partner in the development of the self authoring program and understand</v>

319
00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:55.090
<v Speaker 1>myself that things that he's labored for years on before they really became</v>

320
00:11:55.091 --> 00:11:55.924
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>

321
00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:57.093
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

322
00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:59.200
<v Speaker 1>and he wrote a bang up thesis.</v>

323
00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:00.093
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

324
00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:02.770
<v Speaker 1>I think it was the best thing ever written on this,</v>

325
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.360
<v Speaker 1>on the topic of intelligence.</v>

326
00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:05.180
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

327
00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:07.480
<v Speaker 1>and launched that he started working on in,</v>

328
00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:08.680
<v Speaker 1>in 1993,</v>

329
00:12:08.681 --> 00:12:10.960
<v Speaker 1>which is about the same time that the bell curve came out.</v>

330
00:12:10.961 --> 00:12:14.950
<v Speaker 1>And so his research actually became row relatively politically contentious,</v>

331
00:12:14.951 --> 00:12:19.951
<v Speaker 1>even though all we were trying to do was trying to determine what attributes</v>

332
00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:26.070
<v Speaker 1>predicted success among creative people and among managers and administrators</v>

333
00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.313
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

334
00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:28.870
<v Speaker 1>and academia and so forth,</v>

335
00:12:28.871 --> 00:12:30.190
<v Speaker 1>pure empirical research.</v>

336
00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:31.381
<v Speaker 1>But it became real,</v>

337
00:12:31.381 --> 00:12:33.840
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly politicized anyways.</v>

338
00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.310
<v Speaker 1>So I just got more and more interested in psychometrics,</v>

339
00:12:36.311 --> 00:12:40.450
<v Speaker 1>partly because I realized way back when in 1993 that almost nothing that's</v>

340
00:12:40.451 --> 00:12:42.610
<v Speaker 1>psychologists measured was actually real.</v>

341
00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:44.770
<v Speaker 1>And so we were interested in what was real.</v>

342
00:12:44.771 --> 00:12:47.020
<v Speaker 1>And Daniel is an engineer trained at Mit.</v>

343
00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:48.550
<v Speaker 1>And so he was very,</v>

344
00:12:48.551 --> 00:12:50.560
<v Speaker 1>very method method,</v>

345
00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:52.030
<v Speaker 1>a methodical person.</v>

346
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:55.210
<v Speaker 1>And he didn't like to move ahead with his research at all,</v>

347
00:12:55.211 --> 00:12:59.890
<v Speaker 1>unless he had nailed absolutely everything down in a way that only an engineer</v>

348
00:12:59.891 --> 00:13:01.330
<v Speaker 1>and a software coder would.</v>

349
00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:06.340
<v Speaker 1>And so we started working on personality models and I've been doing that and</v>

350
00:13:06.341 --> 00:13:08.800
<v Speaker 1>concentrating on that more specifically ever since,</v>

351
00:13:08.801 --> 00:13:12.130
<v Speaker 1>as well as writing the more theoretical material that was associated,</v>

352
00:13:12.131 --> 00:13:14.110
<v Speaker 1>say with 12 rules for life in maps of meaning.</v>
