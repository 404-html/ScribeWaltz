00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.930
<v Speaker 1>Would you consider having a discussion with Thomas Soul that Sam Dugan Dougan</v>

2
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:13.531
<v Speaker 1>deal getting?</v>

3
00:00:13.531 --> 00:00:14.580
<v Speaker 1>Probably a,</v>

4
00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:14.911
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

5
00:00:14.911 --> 00:00:15.870
<v Speaker 1>I definitely considered,</v>

6
00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:16.090
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

7
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking hard about reaching out to them.</v>

8
00:00:17.931 --> 00:00:18.360
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

9
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.330
<v Speaker 1>I have some discussions coming up that you might be interested in.</v>

10
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:22.530
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

11
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:23.363
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

12
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to talk on Jocko Willink,</v>

13
00:00:25.731 --> 00:00:26.491
<v Speaker 1>his podcast,</v>

14
00:00:26.491 --> 00:00:31.491
<v Speaker 1>and he was the leader of the Navy seals team in Ramadan and he's quite the tough</v>

15
00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:35.640
<v Speaker 1>character and met him down in San Diego a while back,</v>

16
00:00:35.641 --> 00:00:36.630
<v Speaker 1>a month ago or so.</v>

17
00:00:36.631 --> 00:00:38.100
<v Speaker 1>And that was very interesting.</v>

18
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.220
<v Speaker 1>I have a video already prepared.</v>

19
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.790
<v Speaker 1>That's an interview with [inaudible] out in Herzliya Lee.</v>

20
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.953
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

21
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.680
<v Speaker 1>it was done by Skype and need some editing and so that's been a bit delayed.</v>

22
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.080
<v Speaker 1>I interviewed or discussed,</v>

23
00:00:52.081 --> 00:00:54.870
<v Speaker 1>I had a discussion with Nina Paley who was a great animator.</v>

24
00:00:54.871 --> 00:00:55.950
<v Speaker 1>You guys should look her up.</v>

25
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:57.900
<v Speaker 1>That's Nina Paley.</v>

26
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.260
<v Speaker 1>She animated a lot of the Old Testament and set it to music and I think her</v>

27
00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:07.680
<v Speaker 1>animations are unbelievably beautiful and she has great musical tastes.</v>

28
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.090
<v Speaker 1>They're illegal videos.</v>

29
00:01:09.091 --> 00:01:09.691
<v Speaker 1>Basically.</v>

30
00:01:09.691 --> 00:01:11.220
<v Speaker 1>She's making a knee legal movie.</v>

31
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:12.270
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

32
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.920
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>

33
00:01:13.921 --> 00:01:15.250
<v Speaker 1>I really liked your stuff.</v>

34
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.660
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

35
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.310
<v Speaker 1>I also had a discussion with Claire Lehmann who runs [inaudible],</v>

36
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.960
<v Speaker 1>which is a new news magazine online,</v>

37
00:01:21.961 --> 00:01:24.870
<v Speaker 1>which I think has got real promise and we had a good discussion.</v>

38
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.130
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

39
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.963
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

40
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.391
<v Speaker 1>let's see,</v>

41
00:01:27.391 --> 00:01:28.090
<v Speaker 1>is that a to habitat?</v>

42
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.010
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the how to,</v>

43
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.260
<v Speaker 1>and you probably know or maybe you don't.</v>

44
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:32.563
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

45
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.900
<v Speaker 1>I just finished a discussion with Camille Paglia and we went down there.</v>

46
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.030
<v Speaker 1>I took a film crew down there to Philadelphia and met her at her university.</v>

47
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.391
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

48
00:01:42.391 --> 00:01:42.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

49
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.450
<v Speaker 1>we talked for a couple of hours and that was really interesting.</v>

50
00:01:45.451 --> 00:01:46.650
<v Speaker 1>She's quite the fireball,</v>

51
00:01:46.651 --> 00:01:51.210
<v Speaker 1>that woman and unbelievably verbally fluent and sharp.</v>

52
00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:55.240
<v Speaker 1>And so I finally met someone who can talk more than me and,</v>

53
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.413
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

54
00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.360
<v Speaker 1>that's probably good.</v>

55
00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.111
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

56
00:01:58.111 --> 00:02:01.380
<v Speaker 1>but I really enjoyed speaking with her and I think about a hundred thousand</v>

57
00:02:01.381 --> 00:02:03.030
<v Speaker 1>people have watched that now in a day.</v>

58
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.990
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty good.</v>

59
00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:04.431
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

60
00:02:04.431 --> 00:02:04.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

61
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.790
<v Speaker 1>we talked about postmodernism and the malaise that confronts the modern</v>

62
00:02:08.791 --> 00:02:11.310
<v Speaker 1>university and all of those sorts of things.</v>

63
00:02:11.311 --> 00:02:13.530
<v Speaker 1>So Robin Dion says,</v>

64
00:02:13.531 --> 00:02:14.670
<v Speaker 1>do you ever Miss Montreal?</v>

65
00:02:14.671 --> 00:02:14.851
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

66
00:02:14.851 --> 00:02:16.050
<v Speaker 1>I was just in Montreal.</v>

67
00:02:16.051 --> 00:02:17.060
<v Speaker 1>I went there to sub,</v>

68
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.050
<v Speaker 1>saw a band called half moon run,</v>

69
00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:19.950
<v Speaker 1>which are bound.</v>

70
00:02:19.951 --> 00:02:23.040
<v Speaker 1>I would highly recommend they were playing with the Montreal Symphony Orchestra</v>

71
00:02:23.041 --> 00:02:27.900
<v Speaker 1>and I got invited to meet one of the singers and also going out and,</v>

72
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:28.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

73
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.310
<v Speaker 1>see the concert,</v>

74
00:02:29.311 --> 00:02:30.061
<v Speaker 1>which was excellent.</v>

75
00:02:30.061 --> 00:02:30.391
<v Speaker 1>And Yeah,</v>

76
00:02:30.391 --> 00:02:31.201
<v Speaker 1>I'd Miss Montreal.</v>

77
00:02:31.201 --> 00:02:32.610
<v Speaker 1>Montreal is a great city for you.</v>

78
00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:35.550
<v Speaker 1>Americans who are listening should go visit Montreal.</v>

79
00:02:35.551 --> 00:02:35.791
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

80
00:02:35.791 --> 00:02:36.750
<v Speaker 1>it's a cool place.</v>

81
00:02:36.751 --> 00:02:38.550
<v Speaker 1>And spend a week there in the summer.</v>

82
00:02:38.551 --> 00:02:39.270
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

83
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.660
<v Speaker 1>it's a really good city in,</v>

84
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.513
<v Speaker 1>in every way.</v>

85
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:42.240
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
