1
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.340
<v Speaker 1>Assuming a minimal mutual willingness to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be any contact and to receive</v>

2
00:00:13.311 --> 00:00:16.010
<v Speaker 1>communications,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we may say that the greater the</v>

3
00:00:16.011 --> 00:00:20.120
<v Speaker 1>communicated congruence of experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>awareness and behavior on the part of</v>

4
00:00:20.121 --> 00:00:22.970
<v Speaker 1>one individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more the ensuing relationship will</v>

5
00:00:22.971 --> 00:00:27.140
<v Speaker 1>involve a tendency towards reciprocal</v>
<v Speaker 1>communication with the same qualities,</v>

6
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.040
<v Speaker 1>mutually accurate understanding of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>communications.</v>

7
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.220
<v Speaker 1>It probed psychological adjustment and</v>
<v Speaker 1>functioning in both parties and mutual</v>

8
00:00:34.221 --> 00:00:37.380
<v Speaker 1>satisfaction in the relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty good hypotheses.</v>

9
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.890
<v Speaker 1>So basically what he's saying is that,</v>

10
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.050
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

11
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.580
<v Speaker 1>if we're communicating and I tell you</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's actually going on with me the</v>

12
00:00:46.581 --> 00:00:50.210
<v Speaker 1>best I possibly can and try to get rid</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all of the motives that have nothing</v>

13
00:00:50.211 --> 00:00:55.010
<v Speaker 1>to do with communication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that's going to work out quite</v>

14
00:00:55.011 --> 00:00:58.310
<v Speaker 1>nicely in the long run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna work out for both of us and</v>

15
00:00:58.311 --> 00:01:01.160
<v Speaker 1>for the relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like it's good.</v>

16
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.020
<v Speaker 1>It's an interesting hypothesis.</v>

17
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.240
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you that people don't do</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

18
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.790
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I showed you that Gottman,</v>

19
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many of you looked at</v>
<v Speaker 1>that blame the Godman studies on marital</v>

20
00:01:15.391 --> 00:01:16.290
<v Speaker 1>satisfaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

21
00:01:16.291 --> 00:01:18.840
<v Speaker 1>But I thought that was really</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting because I've seen people</v>

22
00:01:18.841 --> 00:01:20.010
<v Speaker 1>like that lots of times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:01:20.011 --> 00:01:23.220
<v Speaker 1>they're on the surface,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's fine,</v>

24
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.640
<v Speaker 1>but well sometimes the tension is so</v>
<v Speaker 1>high,</v>

25
00:01:26.641 --> 00:01:29.100
<v Speaker 1>you can hardly even stand to be in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>room with the people you know,</v>

26
00:01:29.101 --> 00:01:30.850
<v Speaker 1>because you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can just add,</v>

27
00:01:30.851 --> 00:01:31.490
<v Speaker 1>add,</v>
<v Speaker 1>add,</v>

28
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.520
<v Speaker 1>add an embodied level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're mirroring the distress,</v>

29
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get a pit in your stomach,</v>

30
00:01:36.961 --> 00:01:39.870
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to breathe and you just know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably smell,</v>

31
00:01:39.871 --> 00:01:42.960
<v Speaker 1>I think is what it's trans as what it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>communicated by,</v>

32
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smell affects us and all sorts of ways</v>

33
00:01:47.131 --> 00:01:48.500
<v Speaker 1>we don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here,</v>

34
00:01:48.501 --> 00:01:51.810
<v Speaker 1>here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women like the smell of tee shirts that</v>

35
00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:55.080
<v Speaker 1>men wore if the men are symmetrical</v>
<v Speaker 1>better than if the men aren't</v>

36
00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:58.710
<v Speaker 1>symmetrical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a good example of how smell</v>

37
00:01:58.711 --> 00:02:00.570
<v Speaker 1>affects you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It affects you in lots of ways.</v>

38
00:02:00.571 --> 00:02:01.404
<v Speaker 1>So anyways.</v>

39
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:02.763
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

40
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.500
<v Speaker 1>What godman observed was that basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the capitals that weren't getting</v>

41
00:02:09.501 --> 00:02:11.120
<v Speaker 1>along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just lying to each other all the</v>

42
00:02:11.121 --> 00:02:11.960
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

43
00:02:11.961 --> 00:02:15.110
<v Speaker 1>Because they were pretending that</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything was all right.</v>

44
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.760
<v Speaker 1>When in fact nothing was all right at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

45
00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:20.280
<v Speaker 1>Their bodies were going haywire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a technical term haywire.</v>

46
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.980
<v Speaker 1>So it was way too stressful for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>

47
00:02:23.981 --> 00:02:24.621
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

48
00:02:24.621 --> 00:02:27.380
<v Speaker 1>why is that bad?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why shouldn't you be like that?</v>

49
00:02:27.381 --> 00:02:29.330
<v Speaker 1>Because that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

50
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.510
<v Speaker 1>one is if your stress responses are to</v>
<v Speaker 1>elevated,</v>

51
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.060
<v Speaker 1>we know what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the general I stress response.</v>

52
00:02:35.061 --> 00:02:38.900
<v Speaker 1>Your cortisol levels go up and then well</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you age the fast.</v>

53
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.140
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to age fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very good way of doing it.</v>

54
00:02:42.141 --> 00:02:46.430
<v Speaker 1>But if that's not your goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your goal is peace and harmony.</v>

55
00:02:46.431 --> 00:02:51.170
<v Speaker 1>Then pretending that everything's all</v>
<v Speaker 1>right without communicating isn't going</v>

56
00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:54.020
<v Speaker 1>to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the couples aren't saying things</v>

57
00:02:54.021 --> 00:02:57.110
<v Speaker 1>like</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something about the way we're</v>

58
00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.150
<v Speaker 1>talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's making me extremely nervous,</v>

59
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.080
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then actually tried to figure that</v>

60
00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:02.771
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

61
00:03:02.771 --> 00:03:03.431
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

62
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:05.290
<v Speaker 1>you're making me nervous because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

63
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:06.640
<v Speaker 1>maybe you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe not.</v>

64
00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:08.950
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'm just a nervous type.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God only knows.</v>

65
00:03:08.951 --> 00:03:11.800
<v Speaker 1>Let's see if we can sort this out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe I'm nervous about something</v>

66
00:03:11.801 --> 00:03:14.010
<v Speaker 1>else completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

67
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.460
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm nervous about women.</v>

68
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.100
<v Speaker 1>So there's lots of digging to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

69
00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:23.020
<v Speaker 1>So you can think about that and think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

70
00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:26.140
<v Speaker 1>is that a reasonable proposition now?</v>

71
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.900
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

72
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.520
<v Speaker 1>you can try this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an excellent,</v>

73
00:03:30.521 --> 00:03:32.950
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to t tell you many</v>

74
00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:37.000
<v Speaker 1>specific psychological exercises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is a really good one.</v>

75
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:38.523
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to,</v>

76
00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.870
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

77
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.980
<v Speaker 1>Rio communicational curves and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>evaluative tendency avoided when we</v>

78
00:03:44.981 --> 00:03:49.870
<v Speaker 1>listen with understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the evaluated Roger's theory is,</v>

79
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.320
<v Speaker 1>is difficult to understand with regards</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the relationship between the</v>

80
00:03:53.321 --> 00:03:57.520
<v Speaker 1>evaluation and unconditional positive</v>
<v Speaker 1>regard because he tends to speak as if</v>

81
00:03:57.521 --> 00:04:01.150
<v Speaker 1>the valuation is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But really what he means is hierarchical</v>

82
00:04:01.151 --> 00:04:04.810
<v Speaker 1>elevate evaluation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is you're worse than me or I'm</v>

83
00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:07.780
<v Speaker 1>better than you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like those things might even be</v>

84
00:04:07.781 --> 00:04:10.270
<v Speaker 1>true in any given case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not relevant to what we're</v>

85
00:04:10.271 --> 00:04:11.320
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

86
00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.030
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to do something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it than that.</v>

87
00:04:13.031 --> 00:04:15.610
<v Speaker 1>So when that creeps in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think of that as dominance,</v>

88
00:04:15.611 --> 00:04:16.660
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maneuvering,</v>

89
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.940
<v Speaker 1>not Africans all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When people are talking,</v>

90
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just maneuvering around in a</v>

91
00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:22.870
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not trying to communicate.</v>

92
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.310
<v Speaker 1>So that's the evaluative tendency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does this mean?</v>

93
00:04:27.311 --> 00:04:29.080
<v Speaker 1>It means to see the expressed idea.</v>

94
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.590
<v Speaker 1>And attitude from the other person's</v>
<v Speaker 1>point of view to sense how it feels to</v>

95
00:04:32.591 --> 00:04:36.550
<v Speaker 1>him to achieve his frame of reference in</v>
<v Speaker 1>regard to the thing he is talking about</v>

96
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.900
<v Speaker 1>stated so briefly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This may sound absurdly simple,</v>

97
00:04:40.901 --> 00:04:43.900
<v Speaker 1>but it is not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an approach which we have found</v>

98
00:04:43.901 --> 00:04:46.120
<v Speaker 1>extremely potent in the field of</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy.</v>

99
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.690
<v Speaker 1>It's the most effective agent we know</v>
<v Speaker 1>for altering the basic personality</v>

100
00:04:49.691 --> 00:04:53.470
<v Speaker 1>structure of an individual and improving</v>
<v Speaker 1>his relationships and his communications</v>

101
00:04:53.471 --> 00:04:56.320
<v Speaker 1>with others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a quite the statement.</v>

102
00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.980
<v Speaker 1>You know</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most effective agent we know for</v>

103
00:04:59.981 --> 00:05:02.440
<v Speaker 1>altering the basic personality structure</v>
<v Speaker 1>of an individual.</v>

104
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.030
<v Speaker 1>If I can listen to what he tells me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I can understand how it seems to him,</v>

105
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.220
<v Speaker 1>if I can see it's personal meaning for</v>
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

106
00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.970
<v Speaker 1>if I can sense the emotional flavor</v>
<v Speaker 1>which it has for him,</v>

107
00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.270
<v Speaker 1>then I will be releasing potent forces</v>
<v Speaker 1>of change in him.</v>

108
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.220
<v Speaker 1>If I can really understand how he hates</v>
<v Speaker 1>his father or the university or</v>

109
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.050
<v Speaker 1>columnists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I can catch the flavor of this sphere</v>

110
00:05:23.051 --> 00:05:26.350
<v Speaker 1>of insanity or his fear of atom bombs or</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Russia,</v>

111
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.520
<v Speaker 1>it will be of the greatest help to him</v>
<v Speaker 1>in altering those very hatreds and fears</v>

112
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.060
<v Speaker 1>and in establishing realistic and</v>
<v Speaker 1>harmonious relationships with the very</v>

113
00:05:34.061 --> 00:05:37.810
<v Speaker 1>people and situations towards which he</v>
<v Speaker 1>has felt hatred and fear.</v>

114
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.260
<v Speaker 1>We know from our research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

115
00:05:41.261 --> 00:05:46.261
<v Speaker 1>Rogers was one of the first clinicians</v>
<v Speaker 1>who empirically evaluated the outcome of</v>

116
00:05:46.391 --> 00:05:51.391
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy and so he actually more or</v>
<v Speaker 1>less established the idea that therapy</v>

117
00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.590
<v Speaker 1>outcomes should be measured</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientifically.</v>

118
00:05:53.591 --> 00:05:55.090
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in doing that,</v>

119
00:05:55.091 --> 00:05:55.901
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>

120
00:05:55.901 --> 00:06:00.901
<v Speaker 1>he set down one element of the standards</v>
<v Speaker 1>by which modern clinical psychologists</v>

121
00:06:01.251 --> 00:06:06.251
<v Speaker 1>are actually trained in practice because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the modern clinical psychologist is a</v>

122
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.890
<v Speaker 1>scientist practitioner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is that you should be</v>

123
00:06:09.891 --> 00:06:14.000
<v Speaker 1>trained as a researcher and as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>practitioner and that's quite unique.</v>

124
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.860
<v Speaker 1>Doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>medical doctors for example,</v>

125
00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:18.530
<v Speaker 1>are not trained that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although you could make a very strong</v>

126
00:06:18.531 --> 00:06:22.940
<v Speaker 1>case that they should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know from our research that such</v>

127
00:06:22.941 --> 00:06:25.790
<v Speaker 1>empathic understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding with a person,</v>

128
00:06:25.791 --> 00:06:27.950
<v Speaker 1>not about him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such an effective approach that it</v>

129
00:06:27.951 --> 00:06:30.020
<v Speaker 1>can bring about major changes in</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>

130
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.800
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of you may be feeling that you</v>

131
00:06:33.801 --> 00:06:36.830
<v Speaker 1>listen well to people and that you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>never seen such results.</v>

132
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.420
<v Speaker 1>The chances are very great indeed that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're listening has not been of the</v>

133
00:06:41.421 --> 00:06:44.090
<v Speaker 1>type I have described.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fortunately,</v>

134
00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.610
<v Speaker 1>I can suggest a little laboratory</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiment,</v>

135
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.430
<v Speaker 1>which you could try to test the quality</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your understand.</v>

136
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.380
<v Speaker 1>The next time you get into an argument</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your wife or your friend or with a</v>

137
00:06:54.381 --> 00:06:58.820
<v Speaker 1>small group of friends to stop the</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion for a moment and for an</v>

138
00:06:58.821 --> 00:07:03.320
<v Speaker 1>experiment institute this rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each person can only speak up for</v>

139
00:07:03.321 --> 00:07:08.000
<v Speaker 1>himself once he has first restated the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas and feelings of the previous</v>

140
00:07:08.001 --> 00:07:13.001
<v Speaker 1>speaker accurately and to that speaker</v>
<v Speaker 1>satisfaction.</v>

141
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.680
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the annoying part,</v>

142
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.170
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're in an argument,</v>

143
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:22.340
<v Speaker 1>you're going to use all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>rhetorical devices in order to win.</v>

144
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:26.840
<v Speaker 1>One of the most obvious of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>rhetorical devices is that you make your</v>

145
00:07:26.841 --> 00:07:29.270
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I only half listen cause I'm</v>

146
00:07:29.271 --> 00:07:31.280
<v Speaker 1>formulating what I'm going to say to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>next.</v>

147
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:36.670
<v Speaker 1>And then I pro I impose a bias in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>processing of your argument.</v>

148
00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:42.350
<v Speaker 1>And so that what I address when I talked</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you is the sort of argument that</v>

149
00:07:42.351 --> 00:07:46.070
<v Speaker 1>you'd make if you were weak and stupid</v>
<v Speaker 1>and contemptible and then I go after</v>

150
00:07:46.071 --> 00:07:48.080
<v Speaker 1>that and that's basically a straw man</v>
<v Speaker 1>approach,</v>

151
00:07:48.081 --> 00:07:49.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take your,</v>

152
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:53.810
<v Speaker 1>I take your position and I try to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>it into the scrawny as little ratty ass</v>

153
00:07:53.811 --> 00:07:58.370
<v Speaker 1>thing I can possibly manage illustrating</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it needs to be rubbed out and then</v>

154
00:07:58.371 --> 00:08:01.250
<v Speaker 1>I'd rub it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the rigid approaches are</v>

155
00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:02.650
<v Speaker 1>actually exactly the officer.</v>
