00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.120
<v Speaker 1>How effectively is the Chicago statement on,</v>

2
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.350
<v Speaker 1>on how effectively is the Chicago statement being disseminated?</v>

3
00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.930
<v Speaker 1>How rapidly our universities signing up or,</v>

4
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:17.620
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

5
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:18.400
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.100
<v Speaker 1>you signed on early in this whole crisis,</v>

7
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:22.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:23.263
<v Speaker 1>Purdue,</v>

10
00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.370
<v Speaker 1>they're about 10 or 15 that have,</v>

11
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.260
<v Speaker 1>that have endorsed it or something like it.</v>

12
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:27.040
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

13
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.720
<v Speaker 1>it's not enough to just endorse something,</v>

14
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.750
<v Speaker 1>but if you have leadership that is committed to creating an open platform in</v>

15
00:00:33.971 --> 00:00:35.320
<v Speaker 1>which people can disagree.</v>

16
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:36.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

17
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.330
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

18
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.030
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

19
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.450
<v Speaker 1>one tense,</v>

20
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:38.283
<v Speaker 1>very encouraging.</v>

21
00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.650
<v Speaker 1>I've been invited by number of university presidents to come speak.</v>

22
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.460
<v Speaker 1>We have all kinds of innovations to heterodox academy to foster a more inclusive</v>

23
00:00:47.711 --> 00:00:51.310
<v Speaker 1>climate in which people can actually engage with difference.</v>

24
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.720
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of interests.</v>

25
00:00:52.721 --> 00:00:56.620
<v Speaker 1>So I think the university leaders were very slow to react.</v>

26
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.320
<v Speaker 1>They didn't want to alienate certain factions of students,</v>

27
00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.350
<v Speaker 1>but they're almost all these noble people,</v>

28
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.180
<v Speaker 1>they're almost all liberal left,</v>

29
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:05.703
<v Speaker 1>not a liberal.</v>

30
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.450
<v Speaker 1>They're horrified by what's going on.</v>

31
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.460
<v Speaker 1>They know they're sitting a top of a powder keg.</v>

32
00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.450
<v Speaker 1>They don't want things to blow up in their face has happened at Evergreen.</v>

33
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.360
<v Speaker 1>So this brings us to our,</v>

34
00:01:15.361 --> 00:01:15.670
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

35
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.030
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

36
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.721
<v Speaker 1>another product.</v>

37
00:01:16.721 --> 00:01:18.130
<v Speaker 1>The one that we're most excited by.</v>

38
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.650
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

39
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.110
<v Speaker 1>so we just went online,</v>

40
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.351
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

41
00:01:20.351 --> 00:01:20.890
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

42
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:21.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

43
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.023
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

44
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.211
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

45
00:01:22.211 --> 00:01:24.430
<v Speaker 1>it's called the open mind platform.</v>

46
00:01:24.431 --> 00:01:27.770
<v Speaker 1>If you go to open mind a platform.org,</v>

47
00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.090
<v Speaker 1>you can find we've developed an APP.</v>

48
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.390
<v Speaker 1>We have a whole library of readings and videos.</v>

49
00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.760
<v Speaker 1>We do have an APP that guides you through.</v>

50
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.030
<v Speaker 1>We don't just say here's how to engage with different viewpoints.</v>

51
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.290
<v Speaker 1>We start by saying,</v>

52
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.800
<v Speaker 1>why is it good and we make the case that you need this.</v>

53
00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:45.850
<v Speaker 1>Everybody needs this.</v>

54
00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.193
<v Speaker 1>And to,</v>

55
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.303
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

56
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.180
<v Speaker 1>we remind people that we're all basically self righteous hypocrites.</v>

57
00:01:52.181 --> 00:01:55.870
<v Speaker 1>We have quotes from wisdom traditions around the world and we've all heard this.</v>

58
00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.070
<v Speaker 1>So just a little bit of,</v>

59
00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.581
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

60
00:01:57.581 --> 00:01:59.380
<v Speaker 1>you can call it emotional manipulation if you like,</v>

61
00:01:59.381 --> 00:02:03.550
<v Speaker 1>but just get people into a mindset in which they're willing to say,</v>

62
00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.413
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

63
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.800
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

64
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:05.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

65
00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.801
<v Speaker 1>calm down.</v>

66
00:02:05.801 --> 00:02:06.580
<v Speaker 1>We're all,</v>

67
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.413
<v Speaker 1>we're all uh,</v>

68
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:08.830
<v Speaker 1>and too self righteous here.</v>

69
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.800
<v Speaker 1>And then we,</v>

70
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.140
<v Speaker 1>then we teach them some psychology,</v>

71
00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.980
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

72
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.150
<v Speaker 1>about motivated reasoning.</v>

73
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.450
<v Speaker 1>And only then do we teach them to engage with views that are not their own.</v>

74
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.530
<v Speaker 1>So we've already run this in about 15 or 20 classes.</v>

75
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

76
00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.350
<v Speaker 1>the results so far look promising that at the end of it,</v>

77
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.840
<v Speaker 1>the measures showed that students are more open to other ideas.</v>

78
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.170
<v Speaker 1>So the open mind platform we think is a tool that we think a lot of universities</v>

79
00:02:31.361 --> 00:02:32.340
<v Speaker 1>are going to adopt their,</v>

80
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.430
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of interest in it.</v>

81
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.950
<v Speaker 1>And if there's leadership,</v>

82
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.330
<v Speaker 1>if the professors generally do support viewpoint diversity and open inquiry,</v>

83
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.350
<v Speaker 1>if we change freshman orientation so that students are trained first and</v>

84
00:02:44.351 --> 00:02:47.320
<v Speaker 1>foremost in how to step back,</v>

85
00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.970
<v Speaker 1>give people the benefit of the doubt,</v>

86
00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.770
<v Speaker 1>be open minded.</v>

87
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.250
<v Speaker 1>If we do that first,</v>

88
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

89
00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:52.960
<v Speaker 1>that's like behavioral,</v>

90
00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.410
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

91
00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.790
<v Speaker 1>exposure to some degree,</v>

92
00:02:54.791 --> 00:02:55.061
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

93
00:02:55.061 --> 00:02:57.100
<v Speaker 1>The idea would be that if you're,</v>

94
00:02:57.101 --> 00:03:02.101
<v Speaker 1>if you're afraid or by something that you don't understand the appropriate first</v>

95
00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:03.071
<v Speaker 1>treatment,</v>

96
00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:03.641
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

97
00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:05.680
<v Speaker 1>the treatment is necessary because otherwise the old,</v>

98
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.350
<v Speaker 1>you'll isolate yourself in the ways that you already described.</v>

99
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:09.221
<v Speaker 1>And second,</v>

100
00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:10.690
<v Speaker 1>that brief exposure,</v>

101
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.510
<v Speaker 1>voluntary exposure is going to be the best curative.</v>

102
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.750
<v Speaker 1>Now it's the opposite of the safe space idea is that you need to be protected.</v>

103
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:18.371
<v Speaker 1>Safe space.</v>

104
00:03:18.371 --> 00:03:21.580
<v Speaker 1>The safe space idea is the worst thing you could possibly do for the very people</v>

105
00:03:21.581 --> 00:03:21.960
<v Speaker 1>you're trying.</v>

106
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:22.540
<v Speaker 1>Exactly,</v>

107
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.140
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

108
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.861
<v Speaker 1>I mean the psychology,</v>

109
00:03:23.861 --> 00:03:24.694
<v Speaker 1>what you know,</v>

110
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.690
<v Speaker 1>the psychology behind safe spaces and microaggressions is just the exact</v>

111
00:03:28.691 --> 00:03:29.950
<v Speaker 1>opposite of what we should be doing.</v>

112
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.690
<v Speaker 1>If we want to create kids,</v>

113
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.430
<v Speaker 1>especially black kids,</v>

114
00:03:33.431 --> 00:03:34.264
<v Speaker 1>gay kids,</v>

115
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:35.410
<v Speaker 1>we made whatever.</v>

116
00:03:35.411 --> 00:03:38.440
<v Speaker 1>If you think that they are vulnerable to more stigma,</v>

117
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:39.490
<v Speaker 1>more conflict,</v>

118
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.990
<v Speaker 1>if you think that they are vulnerable,</v>

119
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.050
<v Speaker 1>that's especially when a safe space will be temporarily pleasant,</v>

120
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.480
<v Speaker 1>but in the long run bad course.</v>

121
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.761
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

122
00:03:47.761 --> 00:03:51.670
<v Speaker 1>And that's the critical issue too with regards to safe spaces is that they're</v>

123
00:03:51.671 --> 00:03:55.810
<v Speaker 1>sacrificing the medium and longterm of the students' wellbeing,</v>

124
00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.730
<v Speaker 1>let's say to the short term,</v>

125
00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.120
<v Speaker 1>lack of fear and conflict there.</v>

126
00:04:00.121 --> 00:04:01.630
<v Speaker 1>Infant dialyzing them essentially.</v>

127
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.010
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

128
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.850
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

129
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:04.930
<v Speaker 1>So all right,</v>

130
00:04:04.931 --> 00:04:05.820
<v Speaker 1>so are,</v>

131
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.390
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about the,</v>

132
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.560
<v Speaker 1>the discussion idea.</v>

133
00:04:08.561 --> 00:04:13.000
<v Speaker 1>I've got a personality test online now that's based on this big five aspect</v>

134
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:13.301
<v Speaker 1>scale.</v>

135
00:04:13.301 --> 00:04:15.150
<v Speaker 1>But it might be interesting as something for,</v>

136
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.330
<v Speaker 1>for us to think about too,</v>

137
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.080
<v Speaker 1>to find people who are high in openness and low in conscientiousness or</v>

138
00:04:20.081 --> 00:04:24.850
<v Speaker 1>orderliness and offer them the opportunity to engage in dialogue with people who</v>

139
00:04:24.851 --> 00:04:26.650
<v Speaker 1>have the opposite personality traits,</v>

140
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.311
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

141
00:04:27.311 --> 00:04:28.144
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

142
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.541
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

143
00:04:28.541 --> 00:04:28.991
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

144
00:04:28.991 --> 00:04:31.210
<v Speaker 1>because they're going to run into people like that always,</v>

145
00:04:31.211 --> 00:04:32.030
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

146
00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.490
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

147
00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.760
