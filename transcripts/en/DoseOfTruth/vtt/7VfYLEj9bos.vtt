<v Speaker 1>I have her friend lives in Montreal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his name is James.</v>

2
00:00:03.781 --> 00:00:07.080
<v Speaker 1>Simon is a great painter and he's taught</v>
<v Speaker 1>me a lot of things,</v>

3
00:00:07.081 --> 00:00:08.880
<v Speaker 1>helped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's helped me design my house and</v>

4
00:00:08.881 --> 00:00:13.881
<v Speaker 1>beautify it and I bought some paintings</v>
<v Speaker 1>from him a couple of years ago and he</v>

5
00:00:14.551 --> 00:00:18.720
<v Speaker 1>did this series of paintings where he</v>
<v Speaker 1>went around North America and stood in</v>

6
00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:23.721
<v Speaker 1>different places and then he painted the</v>
<v Speaker 1>view from here down and so it's his feet</v>

7
00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:28.320
<v Speaker 1>planted in different places on roads in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the desert on the ocean.</v>

8
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.540
<v Speaker 1>I have one actually hanging over my</v>
<v Speaker 1>toilet,</v>

9
00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:34.100
<v Speaker 1>which is him standing at a urinal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.190
<v Speaker 1>he was trying to make a point and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>point was that wherever you are,</v>

12
00:00:38.191 --> 00:00:40.680
<v Speaker 1>it's worth paying attention and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

13
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.210
<v Speaker 1>so all these places that he visited,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he looked exactly where he was standing</v>

14
00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:48.570
<v Speaker 1>by the side of the road and the desert</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of mundane in some sense,</v>

15
00:00:48.571 --> 00:00:51.390
<v Speaker 1>but then maybe he put 40 hours into that</v>
<v Speaker 1>painting.</v>

16
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it's very,</v>

17
00:00:52.351 --> 00:00:54.450
<v Speaker 1>very realistic painting with really good</v>
<v Speaker 1>light.</v>

18
00:00:54.451 --> 00:00:58.950
<v Speaker 1>And what he's telling you as a painter</v>
<v Speaker 1>is everything is worth paying attention</v>

19
00:00:58.951 --> 00:01:00.570
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>An infinite amount,</v>

20
00:01:00.571 --> 00:01:03.600
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have enough time and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>the artists does that for you,</v>

21
00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:05.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The artist looks and looks and looks and</v>

22
00:01:05.551 --> 00:01:09.000
<v Speaker 1>locks and locks and then gives you that</v>
<v Speaker 1>vision and so then you can look at the</v>

23
00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:13.530
<v Speaker 1>painting and it reminds you that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right where you are is there's every.</v>

24
00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:16.950
<v Speaker 1>Everything that there is is right where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are and that's a hard thing to</v>

25
00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:18.450
<v Speaker 1>realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's actually true.</v>
