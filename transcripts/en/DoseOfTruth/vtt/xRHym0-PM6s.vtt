00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.650
<v Speaker 1>The first rule in 12 rules for life is stand up straight with your shoulders</v>

2
00:00:11.651 --> 00:00:12.430
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

3
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.110
<v Speaker 1>And I want to tell you a little bit about the world in which that rule applies.</v>

4
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.071
<v Speaker 1>And it's our world.</v>

5
00:00:18.071 --> 00:00:22.780
<v Speaker 1>But it isn't necessarily the world that you think of when you think of our</v>

6
00:00:22.781 --> 00:00:23.590
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

7
00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:24.401
<v Speaker 1>Although it's the world,</v>

8
00:00:24.401 --> 00:00:25.234
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.070
<v Speaker 1>it's funny cause it's a world you know,</v>

10
00:00:27.071 --> 00:00:27.731
<v Speaker 1>but you don't know.</v>

11
00:00:27.731 --> 00:00:28.564
<v Speaker 1>You know it.</v>

12
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.620
<v Speaker 1>It's a world that presents itself to you in literary form and in mythological</v>

13
00:00:32.621 --> 00:00:34.600
<v Speaker 1>foreman and symbolic form.</v>

14
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.040
<v Speaker 1>And you all understand it,</v>

15
00:00:36.041 --> 00:00:36.370
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>

16
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.810
<v Speaker 1>you can't articulate it.</v>

17
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

18
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.390
<v Speaker 1>but I can articulate some of it.</v>

19
00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.340
<v Speaker 1>How many of you have seen the lion king?</v>

20
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:44.410
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

21
00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.520
<v Speaker 1>how many of you haven't?</v>

22
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.781
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

23
00:00:46.781 --> 00:00:47.680
<v Speaker 1>so that's a better question.</v>

24
00:00:47.681 --> 00:00:50.410
<v Speaker 1>Hardly you guys should see the lion king because obviously there's something</v>

25
00:00:50.411 --> 00:00:51.244
<v Speaker 1>wrong with you.</v>

26
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.263
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

27
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.070
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

28
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.861
<v Speaker 1>and in any ways,</v>

29
00:00:53.861 --> 00:00:55.990
<v Speaker 1>I want to tell you about the world of the lion king.</v>

30
00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.290
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

31
00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.100
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I want you to notice is that when you go see that movie or</v>

32
00:01:00.101 --> 00:01:01.120
<v Speaker 1>when you show it to your kids,</v>

33
00:01:01.121 --> 00:01:02.020
<v Speaker 1>when you watch it at home,</v>

34
00:01:02.021 --> 00:01:04.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what you fall into it.</v>

35
00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.700
<v Speaker 1>And that's very strange because first of all,</v>

36
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:07.421
<v Speaker 1>it's not a world,</v>

37
00:01:07.421 --> 00:01:08.500
<v Speaker 1>it's drawings,</v>

38
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:09.071
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

39
00:01:09.071 --> 00:01:10.690
<v Speaker 1>It's animated drawings of a world.</v>

40
00:01:10.691 --> 00:01:13.420
<v Speaker 1>It's very low resolution and the creatures aren't human.</v>

41
00:01:13.421 --> 00:01:14.201
<v Speaker 1>They're animals.</v>

42
00:01:14.201 --> 00:01:15.730
<v Speaker 1>You've all noticed that no doubt.</v>

43
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.060
<v Speaker 1>And the world is magical because things happen in it that aren't the sorts of</v>

44
00:01:21.101 --> 00:01:23.020
<v Speaker 1>things that obviously happened in the real world.</v>

45
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.700
<v Speaker 1>But you don't care about any of that.</v>

46
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.470
<v Speaker 1>You don't care that the animals talk.</v>

47
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.540
<v Speaker 1>You don't care that the lions are kings.</v>

48
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.120
<v Speaker 1>All of that makes perfect sense to you.</v>

49
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.670
<v Speaker 1>And that means that which is a very strange thing,</v>

50
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.830
<v Speaker 1>which it means that the manner in which the characters are represented and the</v>

51
00:01:38.831 --> 00:01:42.790
<v Speaker 1>world that they inhabit is somehow familiar to you because otherwise you</v>

52
00:01:42.791 --> 00:01:45.280
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't fall into it and you wouldn't even.</v>

53
00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.730
<v Speaker 1>And you'd notice that what you're doing is so strange because it really is so</v>

54
00:01:48.731 --> 00:01:49.091
<v Speaker 1>strange.</v>

55
00:01:49.091 --> 00:01:50.830
<v Speaker 1>So imagine the opening of the lion king.</v>

56
00:01:50.831 --> 00:01:55.831
<v Speaker 1>So what happens is that the camera pans over the Great African plain and you see</v>

57
00:01:56.591 --> 00:01:57.790
<v Speaker 1>all the animals gathering,</v>

58
00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:58.041
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

59
00:01:58.041 --> 00:02:01.870
<v Speaker 1>And they're all coming together and there's this kind of thrilling Black Gospel</v>

60
00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:04.990
<v Speaker 1>music going on in the background with an African beat.</v>

61
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.041
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

62
00:02:06.041 --> 00:02:06.970
<v Speaker 1>and it's really well done.</v>

63
00:02:06.971 --> 00:02:11.971
<v Speaker 1>The opening of that movie and then the camera pans up like,</v>

64
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.080
<v Speaker 1>like it's revealing something.</v>

65
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.340
<v Speaker 1>And you see this structure that's known in the movie as pride rock.</v>

66
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.210
<v Speaker 1>And so it's this structure that rises up above the plane and it's,</v>

67
00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.060
<v Speaker 1>it's shaped like it's a mountain essentially,</v>

68
00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:25.631
<v Speaker 1>although it's not,</v>

69
00:02:25.631 --> 00:02:26.351
<v Speaker 1>it's just a rock,</v>

70
00:02:26.351 --> 00:02:26.770
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

71
00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:27.910
<v Speaker 1>it's a high place.</v>

72
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.590
<v Speaker 1>It's a place that you can,</v>

73
00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.660
<v Speaker 1>that you can view everything from.</v>

74
00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.991
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

75
00:02:31.991 --> 00:02:32.824
<v Speaker 1>So it's a place that,</v>

76
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.110
<v Speaker 1>it's a place from which you can get an overview.</v>

77
00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.670
<v Speaker 1>It's a place from which you can see.</v>

78
00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.140
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

79
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.890
<v Speaker 1>you're introduced to the king's little bird whose name I don't remember at the</v>

80
00:02:41.891 --> 00:02:42.610
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>

81
00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.110
<v Speaker 1>and he's the eyes of the king.</v>

82
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.190
<v Speaker 1>And so the king is obviously something that has eyes because he has a bird and</v>

83
00:02:48.191 --> 00:02:51.970
<v Speaker 1>the bird can fly around from up above and see everything and report to him.</v>

84
00:02:51.971 --> 00:02:54.730
<v Speaker 1>So whatever the king is is associated with the bird.</v>

85
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.910
<v Speaker 1>Just like Horus,</v>

86
00:02:56.911 --> 00:02:59.350
<v Speaker 1>the ancient Egyptian God was associated with fall,</v>

87
00:02:59.351 --> 00:03:01.720
<v Speaker 1>could in fact for exactly that reason,</v>

88
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.300
<v Speaker 1>fall cans can see better than any other creature by the way,</v>

89
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.010
<v Speaker 1>better even than human beings.</v>

90
00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:07.300
<v Speaker 1>And we have very good eyesight.</v>

91
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.990
<v Speaker 1>So the king is the creature who can see and the king is a lion.</v>

92
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.620
<v Speaker 1>And the reason the lions are king is because the lines at the top of the food</v>

93
00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:14.951
<v Speaker 1>chain.</v>

94
00:03:14.951 --> 00:03:15.784
<v Speaker 1>That's part of it.</v>

95
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:16.930
<v Speaker 1>But the line is a solar.</v>

96
00:03:16.931 --> 00:03:18.190
<v Speaker 1>Beastie has a main,</v>

97
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.750
<v Speaker 1>he's associated with the sun.</v>

98
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.710
<v Speaker 1>He's associated with the daytime is associated with power and majesty and</v>

99
00:03:23.711 --> 00:03:24.091
<v Speaker 1>strength.</v>

100
00:03:24.091 --> 00:03:26.230
<v Speaker 1>And it's not a mouse that's king,</v>

101
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.070
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

102
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.940
<v Speaker 1>It's not a rat.</v>

103
00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.250
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

104
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.071
<v Speaker 1>it's a lion.</v>

105
00:03:30.071 --> 00:03:30.521
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>

106
00:03:30.521 --> 00:03:32.530
<v Speaker 1>well obviously the lion is king.</v>

107
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:33.131
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

108
00:03:33.131 --> 00:03:36.700
<v Speaker 1>everyone knows that even though animals don't have kings in case you didn't</v>

109
00:03:36.701 --> 00:03:37.330
<v Speaker 1>notice.</v>

110
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.670
<v Speaker 1>So it's not self evident that it should be the lion.</v>

111
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.240
<v Speaker 1>And the lion is on the rock in the sun,</v>

112
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.411
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

113
00:03:44.411 --> 00:03:48.220
<v Speaker 1>So the rock sticks up above everything else and the lion is there and the lion</v>

114
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.280
<v Speaker 1>is paternal lion and he has a mate and the scene opens with them giving birth.</v>

115
00:03:54.971 --> 00:03:56.740
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a nativity scene.</v>

116
00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.701
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

117
00:03:57.701 --> 00:04:01.990
<v Speaker 1>and that's painfully obvious if you watch it with a little bit of detachment,</v>

118
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.350
<v Speaker 1>it's an activity scene and Rafiki who's the Shaman priest lifts up the new</v>

119
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.530
<v Speaker 1>Messiah to the Sun.</v>

120
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.970
<v Speaker 1>And when that happens,</v>

121
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.780
<v Speaker 1>the music swells and all of the animals go down on their knees.</v>

122
00:04:16.781 --> 00:04:17.770
<v Speaker 1>And it's a very,</v>

123
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.360
<v Speaker 1>and then the,</v>

124
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.970
<v Speaker 1>there's a drum beat and the,</v>

125
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.750
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

126
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.590
<v Speaker 1>the words the lion king come up on stage and it's beautifully done.</v>

127
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:27.790
<v Speaker 1>It's beautifully done.</v>

128
00:04:27.791 --> 00:04:28.090
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

129
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.090
<v Speaker 1>they pan up to the revelation of the lion cub to the son two or three times.</v>

130
00:04:33.461 --> 00:04:34.330
<v Speaker 1>And it's really,</v>

131
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.580
<v Speaker 1>it's really emotional moment.</v>

132
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.290
<v Speaker 1>And it's because all of these levels of symbolism lock in at the same time you</v>

133
00:04:41.291 --> 00:04:42.124
<v Speaker 1>have the,</v>

134
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.270
<v Speaker 1>the environment,</v>

135
00:04:43.271 --> 00:04:45.250
<v Speaker 1>the field where all the animals gather.</v>

136
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.820
<v Speaker 1>So all the animals are gathering to review the revelation of something</v>

137
00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:53.821
<v Speaker 1>transcendent and the revelation of what's transcendent is the birth of the new</v>

138
00:04:55.271 --> 00:04:58.810
<v Speaker 1>hero to the king and Queen on the rock above the plane.</v>

139
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.360
<v Speaker 1>And there's a universal truth in that,</v>

140
00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:06.420
<v Speaker 1>which is why the animators worked as hard as they did to make that scene and why</v>

141
00:05:06.791 --> 00:05:10.780
<v Speaker 1>it opens what was one of the most spectacularly successful movies of all time.</v>

142
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:12.483
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

143
00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.970
<v Speaker 1>the way the film makers do it is when Rafiq he holds up the,</v>

144
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.250
<v Speaker 1>the infant Simba,</v>

145
00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.670
<v Speaker 1>the clouds break and the sun shines on it.</v>

146
00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:23.620
<v Speaker 1>And that's the culminating moment.</v>

147
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.390
<v Speaker 1>And that's the revelation of the identity of the newborn hero with the</v>

148
00:05:28.391 --> 00:05:29.980
<v Speaker 1>consciousness of the sun.</v>

149
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.980
<v Speaker 1>And so we're light creatures.</v>

150
00:05:32.981 --> 00:05:34.180
<v Speaker 1>We're daytime creatures.</v>

151
00:05:34.181 --> 00:05:35.350
<v Speaker 1>We're visual creatures,</v>

152
00:05:35.351 --> 00:05:35.870
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

153
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:36.120
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>

154
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.580
<v Speaker 1>we're not,</v>

155
00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:37.001
<v Speaker 1>we don't,</v>

156
00:05:37.001 --> 00:05:38.020
<v Speaker 1>we're not nocturnal.</v>

157
00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.000
<v Speaker 1>The night is when we're unconscious.</v>

158
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:45.090
<v Speaker 1>The day is when we're conscious and the terminology that we use that's</v>

159
00:05:45.401 --> 00:05:49.960
<v Speaker 1>associated with the furtherance of our consciousness is illumination and</v>

160
00:05:49.961 --> 00:05:50.794
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment.</v>

161
00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:55.660
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a tight relationship between waking up and letting the light</v>

162
00:05:55.661 --> 00:06:00.661
<v Speaker 1>shine in and in consciousness and the association between the rays of the sun</v>

163
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.450
<v Speaker 1>and the lifting up of the infant is the association,</v>

164
00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:13.220
<v Speaker 1>the ancient association between the hero who defeats the forces of darkness and</v>

165
00:06:13.221 --> 00:06:14.240
<v Speaker 1>the Sun itself.</v>

166
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.400
<v Speaker 1>And you all know all of that,</v>

167
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.290
<v Speaker 1>which is why that opening works and why it sets the scene for the rest of the</v>

168
00:06:21.291 --> 00:06:22.124
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

169
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:23.960
<v Speaker 1>And what's the rest of the movie?</v>

170
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.973
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

171
00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:26.660
<v Speaker 1>we could think about the landscape.</v>

172
00:06:26.661 --> 00:06:27.141
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

173
00:06:27.141 --> 00:06:29.400
<v Speaker 1>there's a scene where Sam,</v>

174
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:33.500
<v Speaker 1>his father takes him up on top of pride rock and tells him that his kingdom,</v>

175
00:06:33.501 --> 00:06:37.850
<v Speaker 1>that he's the king and his kingdom extends as far as the light touches.</v>

176
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.780
<v Speaker 1>So the landscape is a place with a pyramid in it.</v>

177
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:46.400
<v Speaker 1>They're at the top of the pyramid on a plane that's circumscribed by the light</v>

178
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:48.290
<v Speaker 1>and outside the light is darkness.</v>

179
00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:49.363
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>

180
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:54.490
<v Speaker 1>the mythological landscape in which this story reveals itself is light versus</v>

181
00:06:55.851 --> 00:06:58.220
<v Speaker 1>darkness or order versus chaos.</v>

182
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.880
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is because that is our landscape.</v>

183
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.730
<v Speaker 1>We inhabit peer middle structures.</v>

184
00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.520
<v Speaker 1>Those are hierarchies of other hierarchies.</v>

185
00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:09.080
<v Speaker 1>I think in our society,</v>

186
00:07:09.081 --> 00:07:10.910
<v Speaker 1>those are mostly hierarchies of competence.</v>

187
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.800
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

188
00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.340
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

189
00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:17.150
<v Speaker 1>we inhabit hierarchical structures on a plane that's defined,</v>

190
00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:18.950
<v Speaker 1>defined by our understanding,</v>

191
00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.070
<v Speaker 1>surrounded by what we do not comprehend,</v>

192
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:25.310
<v Speaker 1>and that's the universal human world.</v>

193
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:31.330
<v Speaker 1>And that hierarchy itself is a cooperative structure that enables us to live</v>

194
00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:36.350
<v Speaker 1>with a certain amount of peace and productivity together.</v>

195
00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:41.860
<v Speaker 1>And also to establish a value system with whatever is at the pinnacle of the</v>

196
00:07:43.761 --> 00:07:47.180
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy regarded as whatever's most valuable.</v>

197
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.730
<v Speaker 1>Now think about what happens in the lion king.</v>

198
00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:51.470
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

199
00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:54.020
<v Speaker 1>it's a voyage into what's most valuable.</v>

200
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:56.240
<v Speaker 1>It's an examination of what's most valuable.</v>
