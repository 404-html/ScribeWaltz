1
00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:09.740
<v Speaker 1>So there's no easy way out.</v>

2
00:00:09.741 --> 00:00:10.880
<v Speaker 1>It's not an easy out,</v>

3
00:00:10.881 --> 00:00:14.260
<v Speaker 1>it's just pure cynicism to associate that idea with,</v>

4
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.020
<v Speaker 1>with an easy out,</v>

5
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.853
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

6
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.040
<v Speaker 1>But there is that positive idea that it's continually represented is that the</v>

7
00:00:21.351 --> 00:00:22.011
<v Speaker 1>individuals,</v>

8
00:00:22.011 --> 00:00:27.011
<v Speaker 1>the source of moral choice and the individual is prone to genuine error and</v>

9
00:00:30.411 --> 00:00:33.200
<v Speaker 1>temptation in a believable and realistic way.</v>

10
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.880
<v Speaker 1>But that that doesn't sever the relationship between the individual and the</v>

11
00:00:37.881 --> 00:00:40.370
<v Speaker 1>divine and the possibility of further growth.</v>

12
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.421
<v Speaker 1>And then I would say,</v>

13
00:00:41.421 --> 00:00:43.460
<v Speaker 1>well thank God for that because without that,</v>

14
00:00:43.461 --> 00:00:44.900
<v Speaker 1>like who would have a chance?</v>

15
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:45.231
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

16
00:00:45.231 --> 00:00:46.190
<v Speaker 1>Who would have a chance.</v>

17
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.730
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea that the day that he has presented the infinite,</v>

18
00:00:52.311 --> 00:00:55.910
<v Speaker 1>let's say as presented in the Old Testament is merely judgmental is definitely</v>

19
00:00:55.911 --> 00:01:00.830
<v Speaker 1>wrong and is in fact something that you can contend with and Argen with.</v>

20
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.191
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

21
00:01:01.191 --> 00:01:02.390
<v Speaker 1>I'll close with one thing.</v>

22
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.860
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I learned while I was going through this was the meaning</v>

23
00:01:06.861 --> 00:01:07.760
<v Speaker 1>of the name Israel.</v>

24
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.130
<v Speaker 1>Cause Jacob eventually gets named Israel.</v>

25
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.130
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

26
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.130
<v Speaker 1>and I'm jumping ahead a little bit to the,</v>

27
00:01:13.131 --> 00:01:13.970
<v Speaker 1>to the next lecture,</v>

28
00:01:13.971 --> 00:01:18.971
<v Speaker 1>but Israel and so he's also the father of Israel and the father of the 12 sons</v>

29
00:01:19.461 --> 00:01:21.140
<v Speaker 1>who make up the 12 tribes of Israel.</v>

30
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.290
<v Speaker 1>But what Israel means is he who struggles with God.</v>

31
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.010
<v Speaker 1>And that's such an interesting idea because it's again,</v>

32
00:01:28.011 --> 00:01:29.150
<v Speaker 1>a psychological idea.</v>

33
00:01:29.151 --> 00:01:33.350
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I said earlier that it isn't obvious in the old testament what it</v>

34
00:01:33.351 --> 00:01:35.590
<v Speaker 1>means to believe in God because what Jacob does,</v>

35
00:01:35.591 --> 00:01:36.920
<v Speaker 1>his struggle with God.</v>

36
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.870
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's a really good characterization of an ethical life</v>

37
00:01:41.871 --> 00:01:44.090
<v Speaker 1>because if you're trying to lead an ethical life,</v>

38
00:01:44.091 --> 00:01:45.350
<v Speaker 1>that's what you're doing is you're,</v>

39
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:46.610
<v Speaker 1>you're struggling.</v>

40
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.630
<v Speaker 1>Like blind belief isn't helpful because you don't know what you're believing in.</v>

41
00:01:50.631 --> 00:01:52.310
<v Speaker 1>Like it's just not that helpful.</v>

42
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.380
<v Speaker 1>But if you're possessed by,</v>

43
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.440
<v Speaker 1>by the desire to orient yourself properly,</v>

44
00:01:57.441 --> 00:01:59.150
<v Speaker 1>but also confused by the,</v>

45
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.280
<v Speaker 1>by the existential structure of the world,</v>

46
00:02:01.281 --> 00:02:02.360
<v Speaker 1>which we all are then,</v>

47
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.140
<v Speaker 1>then what you're doing when you're trying to orient yourself properly in life is</v>

48
00:02:06.141 --> 00:02:07.730
<v Speaker 1>struggling ethically.</v>

49
00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.400
<v Speaker 1>And Jacob actually gets quite hurt.</v>

50
00:02:10.401 --> 00:02:11.950
<v Speaker 1>He wrestles with God literally,</v>

51
00:02:11.951 --> 00:02:14.000
<v Speaker 1>and God dislocates his,</v>

52
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.690
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

53
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:15.441
<v Speaker 1>his thigh.</v>

54
00:02:15.441 --> 00:02:15.861
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

55
00:02:15.861 --> 00:02:16.101
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

56
00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:18.650
<v Speaker 1>the idea there is watch the hell out,</v>

57
00:02:18.651 --> 00:02:18.921
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

58
00:02:18.921 --> 00:02:22.160
<v Speaker 1>The thing that you're contending with is powerful,</v>

59
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.840
<v Speaker 1>although you can contend with it.</v>

60
00:02:23.841 --> 00:02:25.220
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing that's so interesting,</v>

61
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.851
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

62
00:02:25.851 --> 00:02:27.710
<v Speaker 1>you do it at some genuine peril,</v>

63
00:02:27.711 --> 00:02:29.540
<v Speaker 1>which I think is exactly right.</v>

64
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.040
<v Speaker 1>But the idea that Israel,</v>

65
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.660
<v Speaker 1>so there's Israel,</v>

66
00:02:32.661 --> 00:02:33.201
<v Speaker 1>the state,</v>

67
00:02:33.201 --> 00:02:34.034
<v Speaker 1>let's say in Israel,</v>

68
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.270
<v Speaker 1>the promised land and all of that.</v>

69
00:02:35.271 --> 00:02:36.800
<v Speaker 1>But there's this more important idea,</v>

70
00:02:36.801 --> 00:02:37.634
<v Speaker 1>which is again,</v>

71
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.780
<v Speaker 1>a psychological idea,</v>

72
00:02:38.781 --> 00:02:40.490
<v Speaker 1>which is the state of Israel,</v>

73
00:02:40.491 --> 00:02:45.230
<v Speaker 1>which is the promised land is the state that everyone who wrestles with God</v>

74
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:46.380
<v Speaker 1>exists in.</v>

75
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.880
<v Speaker 1>And that's not happy,</v>

76
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.640
<v Speaker 1>naive belief in,</v>

77
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:53.361
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

78
00:02:53.361 --> 00:02:53.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

79
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.880
<v Speaker 1>an eternally blessed afterlife.</v>

80
00:02:55.881 --> 00:02:58.100
<v Speaker 1>It's not that it's not a wish fulfillment,</v>

81
00:02:58.101 --> 00:02:58.810
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

82
00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:59.230
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

83
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.850
<v Speaker 1>it's to be actively engaged in life and the difficulties of life,</v>

84
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:04.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

85
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.620
<v Speaker 1>And trying to find the path because that's what wrestling with God is,</v>

86
00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:10.450
<v Speaker 1>is trying to find the path.</v>

87
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.310
<v Speaker 1>And that seems to me what belief means fundamentally in the Old Testament,</v>

88
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.810
<v Speaker 1>perhaps in the new testament as well,</v>

89
00:03:16.811 --> 00:03:21.430
<v Speaker 1>is that belief is expressed in trying to find the path.</v>

90
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.290
<v Speaker 1>And that's an ethical struggle.</v>

91
00:03:23.291 --> 00:03:24.310
<v Speaker 1>And it's a real struggle.</v>

92
00:03:24.311 --> 00:03:25.450
<v Speaker 1>It's the struggle of life.</v>

93
00:03:25.451 --> 00:03:28.270
<v Speaker 1>So as long as you're willing to engage in that struggle,</v>

94
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.170
<v Speaker 1>then hypothetically you have the divine behind you.</v>

95
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.903
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

96
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:36.483
<v Speaker 1>I believe that.</v>

97
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.910
<v Speaker 1>I think that's true because the other thing I see is that the people who set</v>

98
00:03:42.281 --> 00:03:45.000
<v Speaker 1>things right so that the,</v>

99
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.203
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

100
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.370
<v Speaker 1>the horrible forces of cosmic destruction don't do us in the people who are</v>

101
00:03:51.371 --> 00:03:55.780
<v Speaker 1>trying to set things right are the ones that are struggling ethically and so,</v>

102
00:03:55.781 --> 00:03:58.090
<v Speaker 1>and that there is a redemptive element to that.</v>

103
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.240
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think there's any way of being cynical about that.</v>

104
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.003
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

105
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.811
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

106
00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:05.380
<v Speaker 1>so thank you.</v>
