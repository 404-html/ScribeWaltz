1
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:08.410
<v Speaker 1>That's an old painting by,</v>

2
00:00:08.411 --> 00:00:09.760
<v Speaker 1>I think it's Hieronymus Bosch,</v>

3
00:00:09.761 --> 00:00:10.900
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly.</v>

4
00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:12.520
<v Speaker 1>I really liked that because it's,</v>

5
00:00:12.521 --> 00:00:16.390
<v Speaker 1>it's reminiscent of the near death experiences that you hear people describing.</v>

6
00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:17.530
<v Speaker 1>They're quite common as well.</v>

7
00:00:17.531 --> 00:00:18.364
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

8
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:19.203
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

9
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.060
<v Speaker 1>I had it very weird experience once.</v>

10
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:23.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I've told you this story.</v>

11
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.963
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

12
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.260
<v Speaker 1>I was assessing someone who had gone through a car windshield and he was very</v>

13
00:00:29.261 --> 00:00:30.010
<v Speaker 1>depressed.</v>

14
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.540
<v Speaker 1>It had happened a long time before,</v>

15
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.320
<v Speaker 1>but he was very depressed and the insurance company was basically accusing him</v>

16
00:00:35.321 --> 00:00:39.180
<v Speaker 1>of a malingering cause he'd been depressed for so long and you know,</v>

17
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.480
<v Speaker 1>he'd sort of healed up and everything.</v>

18
00:00:40.481 --> 00:00:42.670
<v Speaker 1>But if your left hemisphere is damaged,</v>

19
00:00:42.671 --> 00:00:44.620
<v Speaker 1>especially the frontal part of your left hemisphere,</v>

20
00:00:44.621 --> 00:00:48.190
<v Speaker 1>then you can be in a chronic state of depression because the left hemisphere,</v>

21
00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.390
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking,</v>

22
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.610
<v Speaker 1>is responsible for positive emotion.</v>

23
00:00:51.611 --> 00:00:52.630
<v Speaker 1>And so if it isn't there,</v>

24
00:00:52.631 --> 00:00:54.580
<v Speaker 1>then it's like negative emotion for you.</v>

25
00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.090
<v Speaker 1>And so I went and assessed him and I was giving him this,</v>

26
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.250
<v Speaker 1>I think it was called the MMPI,</v>

27
00:01:00.251 --> 00:01:02.710
<v Speaker 1>the Minnesota multiphasic personality inventory,</v>

28
00:01:02.711 --> 00:01:04.270
<v Speaker 1>which is a kind of a standard,</v>

29
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

30
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.330
<v Speaker 1>path personality test,</v>

31
00:01:07.331 --> 00:01:09.040
<v Speaker 1>half psychopathology test.</v>

32
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.233
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

33
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.730
<v Speaker 1>he was filling it out.</v>

34
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:12.790
<v Speaker 1>He was a very serious guy,</v>

35
00:01:12.791 --> 00:01:13.660
<v Speaker 1>middle aged guy,</v>

36
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.150
<v Speaker 1>nothing about them was new agey in the least.</v>

37
00:01:17.151 --> 00:01:18.730
<v Speaker 1>He was like an accountant I think.</v>

38
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.350
<v Speaker 1>I think in fact he was an accountant,</v>

39
00:01:20.351 --> 00:01:21.340
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly.</v>

40
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:22.713
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

41
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.970
<v Speaker 1>and there's one question and it said,</v>

42
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.300
<v Speaker 1>my spirit has left my body.</v>

43
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.071
<v Speaker 1>I think that's right.</v>

44
00:01:30.071 --> 00:01:30.821
<v Speaker 1>It's very close.</v>

45
00:01:30.821 --> 00:01:33.710
<v Speaker 1>And he stopped and he asked me what,</v>

46
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.480
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

47
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.960
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

48
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure how to answer this.</v>

49
00:01:36.191 --> 00:01:38.290
<v Speaker 1>And so I said,</v>

50
00:01:38.291 --> 00:01:38.411
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

51
00:01:38.411 --> 00:01:38.741
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

52
00:01:38.741 --> 00:01:39.131
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

53
00:01:39.131 --> 00:01:39.790
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

54
00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.380
<v Speaker 1>after I went through the car windshield,</v>

55
00:01:41.381 --> 00:01:43.510
<v Speaker 1>I was in a coma for three weeks,</v>

56
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:44.530
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

57
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:45.370
<v Speaker 1>And I died.</v>

58
00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:50.170
<v Speaker 1>I think he said he died three times and he said that he could remember,</v>

59
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.140
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't remember anything during that period of time and he couldn't</v>

60
00:01:53.141 --> 00:01:54.160
<v Speaker 1>remember the car accident.</v>

61
00:01:54.161 --> 00:01:55.360
<v Speaker 1>That's retrograde amnesia.</v>

62
00:01:55.361 --> 00:01:57.250
<v Speaker 1>It's quite con common with head injuries.</v>

63
00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.760
<v Speaker 1>And he said that during one of those experiences,</v>

64
00:02:00.761 --> 00:02:02.470
<v Speaker 1>and this is all he remembered from the hospital,</v>

65
00:02:02.471 --> 00:02:07.471
<v Speaker 1>was that he came out of his body and went down the long tunnel of light.</v>

66
00:02:08.531 --> 00:02:12.040
<v Speaker 1>You've heard these near death experiences and then saw his family members there</v>

67
00:02:12.041 --> 00:02:17.041
<v Speaker 1>and so other heavenly light and then realized that it wasn't his time and came</v>

68
00:02:17.261 --> 00:02:18.280
<v Speaker 1>back to his body.</v>

69
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.070
<v Speaker 1>Now what was interesting about this guy was that,</v>

70
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.120
<v Speaker 1>well first of all,</v>

71
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.100
<v Speaker 1>I didn't ask him about this,</v>

72
00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.551
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

73
00:02:24.551 --> 00:02:29.551
<v Speaker 1>He basically volunteered this story and it was instigated by this question and,</v>

74
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.370
<v Speaker 1>and he didn't know that anybody else had any,</v>

75
00:02:34.371 --> 00:02:35.880
<v Speaker 1>he ever had an experience like that.</v>

76
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.400
<v Speaker 1>Cause I asked him if he'd ever heard anything about like that and he said no.</v>

77
00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:40.540
<v Speaker 1>So that was interesting.</v>

78
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.290
<v Speaker 1>But what really was interesting is how the hell did he remember that?</v>

79
00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.581
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

80
00:02:45.581 --> 00:02:48.310
<v Speaker 1>Because he had amnesia during that entire period of time.</v>

81
00:02:48.311 --> 00:02:49.660
<v Speaker 1>He was in a bloody coma.</v>

82
00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like he didn't remember anything.</v>

83
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.780
<v Speaker 1>He remembered that.</v>

84
00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:54.423
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

85
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.630
<v Speaker 1>well those experiences are more common than you think.</v>

86
00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.930
<v Speaker 1>And then there's,</v>

87
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:00.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

88
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.270
<v Speaker 1>there's a painting of one,</v>

89
00:03:01.271 --> 00:03:02.360
<v Speaker 1>which is quite interesting,</v>

90
00:03:02.361 --> 00:03:03.970
<v Speaker 1>and that's like a tunnel to heaven.</v>

91
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.800
<v Speaker 1>It's the same basic idea.</v>

92
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.930
<v Speaker 1>It's a little bit more suffering going on in this one,</v>

93
00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:08.321
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

94
00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:10.840
<v Speaker 1>But that's pretty much typical of Hieronymus Bosch.</v>

95
00:03:10.841 --> 00:03:11.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

96
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what was up with that guy,</v>

97
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:14.020
<v Speaker 1>but he was,</v>

98
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.640
<v Speaker 1>he was one strange character.</v>
