1
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.650
<v Speaker 1>Present only nature.</v>

2
00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:08.860
<v Speaker 1>He came to that conclusion.</v>

3
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.990
<v Speaker 1>It was many people have come to that conclusion,</v>

4
00:00:10.991 --> 00:00:14.920
<v Speaker 1>but I think the two who've outlined it most spectacularly,</v>

5
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.220
<v Speaker 1>we're Nietzsche and Dostoevsky had niche is an unbelievably influential</v>

6
00:00:20.291 --> 00:00:20.981
<v Speaker 1>philosopher.</v>

7
00:00:20.981 --> 00:00:21.281
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

8
00:00:21.281 --> 00:00:23.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there was anyone that was more influential</v>

9
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.570
<v Speaker 1>during the entire course of the 20th century accepting a very,</v>

10
00:00:30.571 --> 00:00:33.990
<v Speaker 1>very tiny handful of other people accepting the scientists.</v>

11
00:00:33.991 --> 00:00:35.160
<v Speaker 1>We won't bother with their,</v>

12
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.001
<v Speaker 1>where their discussion,</v>

13
00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:37.530
<v Speaker 1>you could put marks in that category,</v>

14
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.990
<v Speaker 1>you could put Freud in that category partly,</v>

15
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.590
<v Speaker 1>but after that the list starts to get a lot thinner,</v>

16
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.160
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

17
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.810
<v Speaker 1>So maybe there's 10 people up and out level and Dostoyevsky of course,</v>

18
00:00:48.811 --> 00:00:49.320
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

19
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:49.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

20
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.240
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

21
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.150
<v Speaker 1>if you ever,</v>

22
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.460
<v Speaker 1>if anybody ever prepares a list of the top 10 greatest literary figures in the</v>

23
00:00:56.461 --> 00:00:56.821
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

24
00:00:56.821 --> 00:00:58.590
<v Speaker 1>he would be in the top 10 list.</v>

25
00:00:58.591 --> 00:00:58.830
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

26
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.210
<v Speaker 1>I think he's perhaps second to Shakespeare and may be above Shakespeare in my</v>

27
00:01:03.211 --> 00:01:04.044
<v Speaker 1>estimation.</v>

28
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.130
<v Speaker 1>So these aren't trivial people were talking about and they weren't dealing with</v>

29
00:01:08.131 --> 00:01:09.120
<v Speaker 1>trivial issues.</v>

30
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.541
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

31
00:01:12.541 --> 00:01:13.890
<v Speaker 1>So then the question might be,</v>

32
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.450
<v Speaker 1>what's at the bottom of the idea of a transcendent value?</v>

33
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.360
<v Speaker 1>And I want to want it to approach that</v>

34
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.600
<v Speaker 1>staying out of the metaphysical domain as much as possible because you can claim</v>

35
00:01:28.601 --> 00:01:31.990
<v Speaker 1>anything you want from a metaphysical perspective and that's a big problem.</v>

36
00:01:31.991 --> 00:01:33.340
<v Speaker 1>And so people will say,</v>

37
00:01:33.341 --> 00:01:33.521
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

38
00:01:33.521 --> 00:01:35.710
<v Speaker 1>why come up with a hypothesis of God?</v>

39
00:01:35.711 --> 00:01:36.544
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

40
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:37.660
<v Speaker 1>God could be anything.</v>

41
00:01:37.661 --> 00:01:38.680
<v Speaker 1>There's a satire,</v>

42
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:39.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

43
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.930
<v Speaker 1>the flying Spaghetti Monster,</v>

44
00:01:40.931 --> 00:01:41.180
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

45
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.180
<v Speaker 1>is classic satirical representation of a day at that the atheist types used to</v>

46
00:01:46.301 --> 00:01:48.340
<v Speaker 1>buttress their arguments and fair enough,</v>

47
00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:48.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.020
<v Speaker 1>as a satirical idea,</v>

49
00:01:50.021 --> 00:01:51.130
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty damn funny,</v>

50
00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.580
<v Speaker 1>but there's things about this that aren't the least bit of music.</v>

51
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.860
<v Speaker 1>And the thing that's not amusing as well.</v>

52
00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.460
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

53
00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.600
<v Speaker 1>if anything,</v>

54
00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.430
<v Speaker 1>is our culture predicated on,</v>

55
00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.391
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

56
00:02:01.391 --> 00:02:02.224
<v Speaker 1>so what happened?</v>

57
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

58
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.870
<v Speaker 1>Nietzsche and Dostoevsky put this forth,</v>

59
00:02:04.871 --> 00:02:09.871
<v Speaker 1>this set of propositions and out of Dostoyevsky's line of thinking to some</v>

60
00:02:10.301 --> 00:02:11.260
<v Speaker 1>degree grew soldier,</v>

61
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.900
<v Speaker 1>netsuite,</v>

62
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.780
<v Speaker 1>and so as units and documented the absolute horrors of equity predicated Soviet</v>

63
00:02:16.781 --> 00:02:17.441
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>

64
00:02:17.441 --> 00:02:17.741
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

65
00:02:17.741 --> 00:02:19.000
<v Speaker 1>and we don't teach,</v>

66
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.410
<v Speaker 1>we don't learn about that,</v>

67
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:21.490
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

68
00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.761
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

69
00:02:21.761 --> 00:02:26.761
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand is that what happened in the 20th century on the radical left</v>

70
00:02:26.771 --> 00:02:28.900
<v Speaker 1>end of the spectrum is not well documented.</v>

71
00:02:28.901 --> 00:02:30.190
<v Speaker 1>Students don't learn about it.</v>

72
00:02:30.191 --> 00:02:31.270
<v Speaker 1>Why the hell is that?</v>

73
00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:32.980
<v Speaker 1>We learned about World War II,</v>

74
00:02:32.981 --> 00:02:35.350
<v Speaker 1>we learned about what happened in the Holocaust and fair enough,</v>

75
00:02:35.351 --> 00:02:36.490
<v Speaker 1>we absolutely should,</v>

76
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:38.530
<v Speaker 1>but nobody knows.</v>

77
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.070
<v Speaker 1>It's a mystery to everyone when,</v>

78
00:02:40.071 --> 00:02:43.270
<v Speaker 1>when I talk about what happened in the Soviet Union and that's absolutely</v>

79
00:02:43.271 --> 00:02:46.360
<v Speaker 1>appalling and that's to say nothing about what happened in China,</v>

80
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:47.890
<v Speaker 1>which was equally horrible.</v>

81
00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.113
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

82
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.270
<v Speaker 1>the system didn't work.</v>

83
00:02:54.271 --> 00:02:56.190
<v Speaker 1>It was predicated on the wrong values.</v>

84
00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.010
<v Speaker 1>Unless you think that that sort of thing means work,</v>

85
00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.771
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

86
00:02:59.771 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 1>cause you,</v>

87
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.750
<v Speaker 1>you have to define that as well.</v>

88
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.560
<v Speaker 1>But it collapsed under its own weight after it killed tens of millions of</v>

89
00:03:05.561 --> 00:03:05.921
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

90
00:03:05.921 --> 00:03:07.190
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't really instill Ritz.</v>

91
00:03:07.191 --> 00:03:08.710
<v Speaker 1>Not like Russia has recovered.</v>

92
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.190
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem to me like that's a very good definition of worked.</v>

93
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.600
<v Speaker 1>Now whatever we're doing in the West seems to work for all of its flaws.</v>

94
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.861
<v Speaker 1>And the question is,</v>

95
00:03:17.861 --> 00:03:19.300
<v Speaker 1>are we just deceiving ourselves?</v>

96
00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:20.740
<v Speaker 1>Is it just arbitrary power,</v>

97
00:03:20.741 --> 00:03:21.940
<v Speaker 1>politics and opinion,</v>

98
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.710
<v Speaker 1>or is there something at the bottom of it?</v>

99
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:28.623
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

100
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.960
<v Speaker 1>so when Soulja knits and wrote the Gulag archipelago,</v>

101
00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:35.100
<v Speaker 1>he believed that the Russians would have to return to Orthodox Christianity to</v>

102
00:03:35.101 --> 00:03:36.340
<v Speaker 1>find their pathway forward.</v>

103
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.850
<v Speaker 1>And that's of course has made him into a reactionary in the eyes of many of his</v>

104
00:03:39.851 --> 00:03:40.360
<v Speaker 1>critics.</v>

105
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.850
<v Speaker 1>But that is perhaps what is happening in Russia.</v>

106
00:03:42.851 --> 00:03:46.600
<v Speaker 1>Although it's very difficult to tell because Putin also seems to be using his</v>

107
00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:50.980
<v Speaker 1>affiliation with the Orthodox Christian Church as as it means to consolidate</v>

108
00:03:50.981 --> 00:03:51.700
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

109
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.220
<v Speaker 1>So the situation in Russia is unclear,</v>

110
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.750
<v Speaker 1>but a religious revival,</v>

111
00:03:55.751 --> 00:03:57.040
<v Speaker 1>if that's happening in Russia,</v>

112
00:03:57.041 --> 00:03:58.030
<v Speaker 1>and perhaps it isn't,</v>

113
00:03:58.031 --> 00:03:59.020
<v Speaker 1>but if it is happening,</v>

114
00:03:59.021 --> 00:04:01.570
<v Speaker 1>is something that unfolds over decades and even centuries.</v>

115
00:04:01.571 --> 00:04:05.050
<v Speaker 1>So it's not an easy thing to evaluate when it first starts to happen.</v>

116
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.500
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

117
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.350
<v Speaker 1>But soldier knits and drew the same conclusions that Dostoyevsky did.</v>

118
00:04:10.351 --> 00:04:11.101
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally.</v>

119
00:04:11.101 --> 00:04:11.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

120
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.170
<v Speaker 1>not in exactly the same way,</v>

121
00:04:13.171 --> 00:04:13.591
<v Speaker 1>but very,</v>

122
00:04:13.591 --> 00:04:14.251
<v Speaker 1>very close.</v>

123
00:04:14.251 --> 00:04:14.430
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

124
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.020
<v Speaker 1>he believed as far as I could tell that unless people were willing to adhere to</v>

125
00:04:19.021 --> 00:04:20.670
<v Speaker 1>some sort of transcendent value,</v>

126
00:04:20.671 --> 00:04:25.230
<v Speaker 1>that they had no protection against pathological ideologies and no protection</v>

127
00:04:25.231 --> 00:04:27.450
<v Speaker 1>against the murderous impulses that came along with them.</v>

128
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.560
<v Speaker 1>And I found his work in unbelievably,</v>

129
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:32.481
<v Speaker 1>I found his right.</v>

130
00:04:32.481 --> 00:04:33.270
<v Speaker 1>Incredible,</v>

131
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.841
<v Speaker 1>powerful,</v>

132
00:04:33.841 --> 00:04:34.674
<v Speaker 1>incredible.</v>

133
00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how you can read that book and not draw that kind of conclusion.</v>

134
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.030
<v Speaker 1>I think people who criticize soldier nets and have never read the damn book</v>

135
00:04:42.031 --> 00:04:43.200
<v Speaker 1>because that book is like,</v>

136
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.890
<v Speaker 1>it's like going into the ring with Mohammed Ali and being pummeled to death for</v>

137
00:04:46.891 --> 00:04:47.724
<v Speaker 1>half an hour.</v>

138
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:48.151
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

139
00:04:48.151 --> 00:04:49.830
<v Speaker 1>you don't recover from it that easily.</v>

140
00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.113
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

141
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.860
<v Speaker 1>then young branched off of nature.</v>

142
00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.160
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

143
00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.661
<v Speaker 1>And so niche,</v>

144
00:04:58.661 --> 00:05:01.230
<v Speaker 1>his idea was that people would have to create their own values,</v>

145
00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.220
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>

146
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:03.990
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's where niches is.</v>

147
00:05:03.991 --> 00:05:04.261
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

148
00:05:04.261 --> 00:05:04.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

149
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.500
<v Speaker 1>is his weakest because it isn't obvious to me that people can create their own</v>

150
00:05:09.631 --> 00:05:10.171
<v Speaker 1>values.</v>

151
00:05:10.171 --> 00:05:11.820
<v Speaker 1>And I think he fell into,</v>

152
00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be a casual critic of nature because that's always dangerous</v>

153
00:05:16.021 --> 00:05:18.480
<v Speaker 1>given that he probably had an Iq of 260,</v>

154
00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:19.201
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

155
00:05:19.201 --> 00:05:19.441
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

156
00:05:19.441 --> 00:05:21.420
<v Speaker 1>he was way the hell out there in the stratosphere.</v>

157
00:05:21.421 --> 00:05:23.760
<v Speaker 1>And just when you think you've understood what he was talking about,</v>

158
00:05:23.761 --> 00:05:25.500
<v Speaker 1>you can be bloody well sure that you didn't.</v>

159
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.090
<v Speaker 1>But it does seem to me,</v>

160
00:05:27.091 --> 00:05:28.170
<v Speaker 1>and he was running out of time,</v>

161
00:05:28.171 --> 00:05:28.981
<v Speaker 1>he died young,</v>

162
00:05:28.981 --> 00:05:29.201
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

163
00:05:29.201 --> 00:05:31.140
<v Speaker 1>when he was trying to solve this problem in a rush,</v>

164
00:05:31.141 --> 00:05:31.974
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

165
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:37.370
<v Speaker 1>And he hypothesized that people would have to become superman over men,</v>

166
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.410
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking in order to deal with the death of God.</v>

167
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.640
<v Speaker 1>And that idea sort of branched off into Nazi propaganda because that's in some</v>

168
00:05:44.641 --> 00:05:47.700
<v Speaker 1>sense with the Nazis were trying to do with their promotion of the,</v>

169
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.200
<v Speaker 1>of the perfect area.</v>

170
00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.501
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

171
00:05:49.501 --> 00:05:50.334
<v Speaker 1>now it's a mist.</v>

172
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.400
<v Speaker 1>It's a misappropriation of nature in my estimation.</v>

173
00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:57.210
<v Speaker 1>And it was partly because his sister who was a perverse creature,</v>

174
00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:58.693
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

175
00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:59.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

176
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.921
<v Speaker 1>what would you say?</v>

177
00:06:00.921 --> 00:06:05.900
<v Speaker 1>Doctored his work in such a way so that it was more easily appropriated by the</v>

178
00:06:05.901 --> 00:06:06.680
<v Speaker 1>Nazis.</v>

179
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.690
<v Speaker 1>But there is some danger in what he said too.</v>

180
00:06:08.691 --> 00:06:09.650
<v Speaker 1>Because you know the,</v>

181
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:10.431
<v Speaker 1>the question is,</v>

182
00:06:10.431 --> 00:06:10.581
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

183
00:06:10.581 --> 00:06:12.800
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to transform yourself into the,</v>

184
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:14.660
<v Speaker 1>into the giver of values,</v>

185
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:19.310
<v Speaker 1>what stops you from inflating yourself into something like a demigod and just</v>

186
00:06:19.311 --> 00:06:21.860
<v Speaker 1>pronouncing what the values are going to be.</v>

187
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.750
<v Speaker 1>So that's a problem.</v>

188
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:26.040
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

189
00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:30.800
<v Speaker 1>you're going to replace tradition with yourself.</v>

190
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.953
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

191
00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.490
<v Speaker 1>there's dangers in that because there's nothing to keep you humble.</v>

192
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:37.910
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

193
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:39.650
<v Speaker 1>that's the most appropriate objection.</v>

194
00:06:39.651 --> 00:06:40.940
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing to keep you humble.</v>

195
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.880
<v Speaker 1>And those things can spiral out of control very rapidly.</v>

196
00:06:43.881 --> 00:06:45.920
<v Speaker 1>And they did say in the case of Hitler,</v>

197
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's easy to blame what happened in Germany on Hitler,</v>

198
00:06:48.621 --> 00:06:49.100
<v Speaker 1>but that's a,</v>

199
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.880
<v Speaker 1>that's a big mistake because it was a dialogue between Hitler and the German</v>

200
00:06:52.881 --> 00:06:53.690
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

201
00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:53.901
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

202
00:06:53.901 --> 00:06:55.370
<v Speaker 1>Hitler didn't create himself.</v>

203
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:56.720
<v Speaker 1>It was cocreation.</v>

204
00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:00.620
<v Speaker 1>He said things people listened and told him back what to say.</v>

205
00:07:00.621 --> 00:07:04.100
<v Speaker 1>And then he said them and they listened and they told him back what to say.</v>

206
00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:08.840
<v Speaker 1>And it looped until he was the mouthpiece of their darkest desires.</v>

207
00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:09.860
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a good,</v>

208
00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.600
<v Speaker 1>that's a game he was willing to play.</v>

209
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.550
<v Speaker 1>But you can't think about that as it isn't like Hitler created Nazi Germany,</v>

210
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.840
<v Speaker 1>Hitler and the Germans cocreated Nazi Germany now.</v>

211
00:07:20.841 --> 00:07:25.841
<v Speaker 1>And a leader gives our articulation to the imagination of the population.</v>

212
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:27.410
<v Speaker 1>That's what a leader does.</v>

213
00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:29.180
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

214
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:29.931
<v Speaker 1>you could say that,</v>

215
00:07:29.931 --> 00:07:30.111
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

216
00:07:30.111 --> 00:07:33.770
<v Speaker 1>Hitler may be Hitler filtered what the Germans were telling him through a</v>

217
00:07:33.771 --> 00:07:37.580
<v Speaker 1>particular lens because he had no shortage of resentment and desire for revenge</v>

218
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:38.720
<v Speaker 1>in his own heart.</v>

219
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:39.580
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

220
00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:40.413
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

221
00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:45.350
<v Speaker 1>it's not like his life was his spectacular success be before he became a</v>

222
00:07:45.351 --> 00:07:46.310
<v Speaker 1>political activist.</v>

223
00:07:46.311 --> 00:07:48.650
<v Speaker 1>And he was brutalized very badly in world war one.</v>

224
00:07:48.651 --> 00:07:51.230
<v Speaker 1>And he didn't get to pursue his primary dream,</v>

225
00:07:51.231 --> 00:07:54.050
<v Speaker 1>which was to be an art student in Vienna.</v>

226
00:07:54.051 --> 00:07:57.140
<v Speaker 1>And he had applied three times and got rejected all three times.</v>

227
00:07:57.141 --> 00:07:58.640
<v Speaker 1>And so he was bitter about that.</v>

228
00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:01.700
<v Speaker 1>He was basically living on the streets after World War One.</v>

229
00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.680
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't the world's happiest person,</v>

230
00:08:03.681 --> 00:08:07.520
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sure he carried a fair bit of resentment in his heart when he was in the</v>

231
00:08:07.521 --> 00:08:09.950
<v Speaker 1>trenches in world war war one at,</v>

232
00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.810
<v Speaker 1>at in one experience that he had,</v>

233
00:08:11.811 --> 00:08:15.740
<v Speaker 1>all of his friends were killed by a mortar when he had wandered off to go do</v>

234
00:08:15.741 --> 00:08:16.574
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>

235
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:17.713
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

236
00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:18.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

237
00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.780
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to even imagine what something like that would do to you,</v>

238
00:08:20.781 --> 00:08:24.230
<v Speaker 1>but I can tell you when you're the only survivor out of 20 people,</v>

239
00:08:24.231 --> 00:08:28.190
<v Speaker 1>that's also going to give you an enhanced sense of your own specialists.</v>

240
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.580
<v Speaker 1>Because the alternative is just to think about how God damn arbitrary the</v>

241
00:08:31.581 --> 00:08:32.750
<v Speaker 1>universe really is.</v>
