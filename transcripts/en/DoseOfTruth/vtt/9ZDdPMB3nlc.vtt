1
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.520
<v Speaker 1>So that what we see here is an echo in some sense of what happens in the</v>

2
00:00:11.521 --> 00:00:13.080
<v Speaker 1>Mesopotamian creation story.</v>

3
00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:13.914
<v Speaker 1>When [inaudible]</v>

4
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.410
<v Speaker 1>in the Mesopotamian creation story,</v>

5
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.050
<v Speaker 1>there's the dragon of chaos tie amat and her consort.</v>

6
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.283
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

7
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.093
<v Speaker 1>absolutely</v>

8
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.120
<v Speaker 1>freshwater and saltwater respectively in they're mingled together.</v>

9
00:00:29.121 --> 00:00:29.954
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

10
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.780
<v Speaker 1>and that combination of chaos and order gives rise to the first assembly of the</v>

11
00:00:34.781 --> 00:00:35.680
<v Speaker 1>ancient gods.</v>

12
00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:40.681
<v Speaker 1>And then the ancient gods kill Appsu casually and foolishly and enrage tie a mat</v>

13
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.340
<v Speaker 1>with their foolishness and ignorance.</v>

14
00:00:45.341 --> 00:00:47.230
<v Speaker 1>And she comes back with a vengeance</v>

15
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.400
<v Speaker 1>in the meantime.</v>

16
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.390
<v Speaker 1>And then she produces this huge army of monsters and puts Kingu the worst of the</v>

17
00:00:54.391 --> 00:00:57.600
<v Speaker 1>monsters out its head and the decide she's going to take out her creation.</v>

18
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.100
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a little warning from 3000 years ago about foolishly undermining</v>

19
00:01:03.991 --> 00:01:04.830
<v Speaker 1>your tradition.</v>

20
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.090
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

21
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.660
<v Speaker 1>the gods in their friends,</v>

22
00:01:09.661 --> 00:01:11.580
<v Speaker 1>they go out and try to fight against tie mountain.</v>

23
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.850
<v Speaker 1>They come back with their tails between their legs continually,</v>

24
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.940
<v Speaker 1>but then a new God appears on the scene and that's Marduk.</v>

25
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.510
<v Speaker 1>And he's got eyes all the way around his head and he can speak words of magic.</v>

26
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.970
<v Speaker 1>And they know that there's something new about this newest God.</v>

27
00:01:27.971 --> 00:01:31.450
<v Speaker 1>It's his capacity for vision in this capacity for articulate speech.</v>

28
00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:32.471
<v Speaker 1>And so they say,</v>

29
00:01:32.471 --> 00:01:32.591
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

30
00:01:32.591 --> 00:01:35.620
<v Speaker 1>why don't you go out and try to deal with the chaos?</v>

31
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.030
<v Speaker 1>And Martech says,</v>

32
00:01:37.031 --> 00:01:37.331
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

33
00:01:37.331 --> 00:01:37.691
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

34
00:01:37.691 --> 00:01:38.231
<v Speaker 1>no problem,</v>

35
00:01:38.231 --> 00:01:39.160
<v Speaker 1>but here's the deal.</v>

36
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.870
<v Speaker 1>You elect me talk God,</v>

37
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.810
<v Speaker 1>and now I determine the destiny of the world.</v>

38
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.040
<v Speaker 1>And so they're desperate because like ty,</v>

39
00:01:47.041 --> 00:01:48.130
<v Speaker 1>Matt is coming to get them.</v>

40
00:01:48.131 --> 00:01:50.710
<v Speaker 1>That's chaos with the worst of all possible monsters.</v>

41
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.930
<v Speaker 1>They're probably thinking he's not going to win anyways.</v>

42
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.760
<v Speaker 1>And so they agree and out he goes and he confronts timeout,</v>

43
00:01:57.761 --> 00:02:02.110
<v Speaker 1>who's the goddess of chaos and he cuts her into pieces and he makes the world</v>

44
00:02:02.111 --> 00:02:03.280
<v Speaker 1>out of her pieces.</v>

45
00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.540
<v Speaker 1>And one of his names is he who makes ingenious things out of the combat with</v>

46
00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:08.583
<v Speaker 1>tire math,</v>

47
00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:09.940
<v Speaker 1>which is so interesting.</v>

48
00:02:09.941 --> 00:02:11.380
<v Speaker 1>That's such a remarkable,</v>

49
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.000
<v Speaker 1>that's a remarkable bit of nomenclature.</v>

50
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:17.340
<v Speaker 1>So who's should be at the pinnacle?</v>

51
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.650
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

52
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.850
<v Speaker 1>The forest that sees and speaks and goes out to confront chaos voluntarily.</v>

53
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.190
<v Speaker 1>You know how many years it took people to figure that out.</v>

54
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.020
<v Speaker 1>That's like the pinnacle discovery of humanity.</v>

55
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.920
<v Speaker 1>That's what that is.</v>

56
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.090
<v Speaker 1>And it's echoed here.</v>

57
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.811
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

58
00:02:32.811 --> 00:02:34.310
<v Speaker 1>you see Simeon and Levi,</v>

59
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.210
<v Speaker 1>they're too angry.</v>

60
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:36.661
<v Speaker 1>The other brothers,</v>

61
00:02:36.661 --> 00:02:41.310
<v Speaker 1>they all have flaws and faults of various sorts and so they're not elevated to</v>

62
00:02:41.311 --> 00:02:42.210
<v Speaker 1>the highest place.</v>

63
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.231
<v Speaker 1>But Joseph,</v>

64
00:02:43.231 --> 00:02:46.260
<v Speaker 1>because he has his coat of many colors and because he lands on his feet,</v>

65
00:02:46.261 --> 00:02:47.340
<v Speaker 1>no matter where he goes,</v>

66
00:02:47.341 --> 00:02:52.341
<v Speaker 1>and because he's not resentful and bitter and malevolent and genocidal and,</v>

67
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.800
<v Speaker 1>and he's not shaking his fist at the sky or yelling at God because of Trump.</v>

68
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Speaker 1>Let's say Dan,</v>

69
00:03:00.191 --> 00:03:01.000
<v Speaker 1>he's the,</v>

70
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.050
<v Speaker 1>he's the right,</v>

71
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.560
<v Speaker 1>he's the right representative of the 12 tribes.</v>

72
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.540
<v Speaker 1>And so that's brilliant.</v>

73
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:08.680
<v Speaker 1>It's a brilliant story.</v>

74
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.330
<v Speaker 1>All these are the 12 tribes of Israel and this is it.</v>

75
00:03:13.331 --> 00:03:15.220
<v Speaker 1>That their farther spake unto them and blessed them.</v>

76
00:03:15.221 --> 00:03:16.690
<v Speaker 1>Everyone according to his blessing,</v>

77
00:03:16.691 --> 00:03:17.524
<v Speaker 1>he blessed them</v>

78
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.490
<v Speaker 1>when Jake had been made an end of commanding his son.</v>

79
00:03:21.491 --> 00:03:23.890
<v Speaker 1>So it's the last thing he does to state.</v>

80
00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:26.560
<v Speaker 1>He knows that these are the 12 tribes that will</v>

81
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.250
<v Speaker 1>progress into the future of this people and now he's trying it.</v>

82
00:03:33.251 --> 00:03:37.870
<v Speaker 1>The last thing he does is to try to hierarchically organize their relative</v>

83
00:03:37.871 --> 00:03:41.680
<v Speaker 1>virtues as an indication of what has been learned.</v>

84
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.190
<v Speaker 1>And when Jacob has made an end of commanding his sons,</v>

85
00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:48.640
<v Speaker 1>he gathered up his feet into the bed and yielded up the ghost and was gathered</v>

86
00:03:48.641 --> 00:03:49.474
<v Speaker 1>unto his people.</v>

87
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.020
<v Speaker 1>And Joseph fell upon his father's face and wept upon him and kissed him.</v>

88
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.610
<v Speaker 1>And Joseph commanded his servants to the physicians to embalm his father and the</v>

89
00:03:57.611 --> 00:03:59.020
<v Speaker 1>physicians embalmed Israel.</v>

90
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.380
<v Speaker 1>And when the days of his morning we're past,</v>

91
00:04:02.381 --> 00:04:04.510
<v Speaker 1>Joseph's spake unto the house of Pharaoh saying,</v>

92
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.690
<v Speaker 1>if now I have found grace in your eyes,</v>

93
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.441
<v Speaker 1>speak,</v>

94
00:04:08.441 --> 00:04:10.510
<v Speaker 1>I pray you in the ears of Pharaoh saying,</v>

95
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.910
<v Speaker 1>my father made me swear a saying low.</v>

96
00:04:12.911 --> 00:04:14.080
<v Speaker 1>I die in my grave,</v>

97
00:04:14.081 --> 00:04:16.060
<v Speaker 1>which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan,</v>

98
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:17.051
<v Speaker 1>their shelter,</v>

99
00:04:17.051 --> 00:04:18.310
<v Speaker 1>I'll bury me now.</v>

100
00:04:18.311 --> 00:04:19.390
<v Speaker 1>Therefore let me go up.</v>

101
00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:21.760
<v Speaker 1>I pray thee and bury my father and I will come again.</v>

102
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.931
<v Speaker 1>And Pharaoh said,</v>

103
00:04:22.931 --> 00:04:24.280
<v Speaker 1>go up and burry thy father.</v>

104
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.810
<v Speaker 1>According as he made the swear for her,</v>

105
00:04:27.811 --> 00:04:31.150
<v Speaker 1>son's carried him into the land of Canaan and bury them in the cave of the field</v>

106
00:04:31.151 --> 00:04:32.050
<v Speaker 1>of Mac,</v>

107
00:04:32.051 --> 00:04:32.500
<v Speaker 1>Pella,</v>

108
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.970
<v Speaker 1>which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of the,</v>

109
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.970
<v Speaker 1>of burying place of effort on the Hittite before mammary and Joseph returned</v>

110
00:04:39.971 --> 00:04:40.601
<v Speaker 1>into Egypt,</v>

111
00:04:40.601 --> 00:04:45.601
<v Speaker 1>he and his brother and all that went up to him and that all and all that went up</v>

112
00:04:45.971 --> 00:04:48.030
<v Speaker 1>with him to bury his father after he is brewed,</v>

113
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.540
<v Speaker 1>after he had buried his father.</v>

114
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.440
<v Speaker 1>And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead,</v>

115
00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:54.693
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>

116
00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.330
<v Speaker 1>Joseph will now hate us and we'll certainly pay back to us all the evil which we</v>

117
00:05:00.881 --> 00:05:01.714
<v Speaker 1>did unto him.</v>

118
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.400
<v Speaker 1>And they sent a messenger saying they father did command before he died,</v>

119
00:05:06.401 --> 00:05:09.250
<v Speaker 1>saying four shall ye say unto Joseph,</v>

120
00:05:09.251 --> 00:05:09.761
<v Speaker 1>forgive.</v>

121
00:05:09.761 --> 00:05:13.690
<v Speaker 1>I pray thee now the trespass of thy Brethren and their sin pretty sniffily,</v>

122
00:05:13.691 --> 00:05:14.524
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

123
00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:15.970
<v Speaker 1>for they did unto thee evil.</v>

124
00:05:15.971 --> 00:05:16.900
<v Speaker 1>And now we pray thee.</v>

125
00:05:16.901 --> 00:05:20.740
<v Speaker 1>Forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy Father.</v>

126
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.840
<v Speaker 1>And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.</v>

127
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.930
<v Speaker 1>And his brethren also went and fell down before his face.</v>

128
00:05:25.931 --> 00:05:26.441
<v Speaker 1>And they said,</v>

129
00:05:26.441 --> 00:05:26.921
<v Speaker 1>behold,</v>

130
00:05:26.921 --> 00:05:28.030
<v Speaker 1>we be thy servants.</v>

131
00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.000
<v Speaker 1>And Joseph said unto them,</v>

132
00:05:31.001 --> 00:05:34.510
<v Speaker 1>fear not for am I in the place of God,</v>

133
00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:35.351
<v Speaker 1>but as for you,</v>

134
00:05:35.351 --> 00:05:36.820
<v Speaker 1>you thought evil against me.</v>

135
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.010
<v Speaker 1>But God meant it unto good to bring,</v>

136
00:05:39.011 --> 00:05:39.844
<v Speaker 1>to pass,</v>

137
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.020
<v Speaker 1>as it is this day,</v>

138
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.790
<v Speaker 1>to save much people alive</v>

139
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.601
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

140
00:05:46.601 --> 00:05:46.961
<v Speaker 1>therefore,</v>

141
00:05:46.961 --> 00:05:47.621
<v Speaker 1>fear you not,</v>

142
00:05:47.621 --> 00:05:49.060
<v Speaker 1>I will nourish you and your little ones.</v>

143
00:05:49.061 --> 00:05:51.130
<v Speaker 1>And he comforted them and spake kindly unto them.</v>

144
00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.053
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

145
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.100
<v Speaker 1>the idea there is that</v>

146
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.020
<v Speaker 1>there is no evil,</v>

147
00:06:06.021 --> 00:06:08.550
<v Speaker 1>so evil that good cannot triumph over it.</v>

148
00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.950
<v Speaker 1>And Joseph dwelt in Egypt.</v>

149
00:06:12.951 --> 00:06:13.970
<v Speaker 1>He and his father's house,</v>

150
00:06:13.971 --> 00:06:15.740
<v Speaker 1>and Joseph lived 110 years,</v>

151
00:06:15.741 --> 00:06:18.770
<v Speaker 1>and Joseph saw frms children of the third generation,</v>

152
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.570
<v Speaker 1>the children also of Makir,</v>

153
00:06:20.571 --> 00:06:23.510
<v Speaker 1>the son of Manhasset were brought up upon Joseph's knees.</v>

154
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.360
<v Speaker 1>And Joseph said unto his brethren,</v>

155
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:27.673
<v Speaker 1>I die,</v>

156
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:31.640
<v Speaker 1>and God will surely visit you and bring you out of this land unto the land where</v>

157
00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:32.720
<v Speaker 1>he swear to Abraham,</v>

158
00:06:32.721 --> 00:06:33.261
<v Speaker 1>to Isaac,</v>

159
00:06:33.261 --> 00:06:37.160
<v Speaker 1>and Jacob and Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel saying,</v>

160
00:06:37.161 --> 00:06:38.970
<v Speaker 1>God will surely visit you and she'll end.</v>

161
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.030
<v Speaker 1>You shall carry my bones from hence.</v>

162
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.060
<v Speaker 1>So Joseph died being a 110 years old,</v>

163
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:49.450
<v Speaker 1>and they embalmed him and he was put into a coffin in Egypt.</v>

164
00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:52.280
<v Speaker 1>And that's genesis.</v>
