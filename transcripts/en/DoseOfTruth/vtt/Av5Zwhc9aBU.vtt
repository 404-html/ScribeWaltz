1
00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.013
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2
00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.550
<v Speaker 1>Speaking of the universities though,</v>

3
00:00:12.551 --> 00:00:16.390
<v Speaker 1>I have to talk about high schools for a minute because following her event,</v>

4
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.320
<v Speaker 1>I find it interesting actually before the event and post the event,</v>

5
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.860
<v Speaker 1>the most emails I've gotten are all from high school teachers,</v>

6
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.420
<v Speaker 1>couple from elementary,</v>

7
00:00:25.421 --> 00:00:26.650
<v Speaker 1>but mostly high school teachers.</v>

8
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.570
<v Speaker 1>And the tone of these emails is borderline desperate.</v>

9
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.650
<v Speaker 1>They are absolutely losing their minds because they feel that they are being</v>

10
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
<v Speaker 1>compelled to indoctrinate a youth into this type of radical Marxist</v>

11
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.110
<v Speaker 1>postmodernist thinking.</v>

12
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.750
<v Speaker 1>And even though they don't agree with it,</v>

13
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.630
<v Speaker 1>they see the flaws in it and many flaws in it.</v>

14
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.850
<v Speaker 1>They don't feel they have a voice.</v>

15
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.360
<v Speaker 1>We just are afraid to speak up the letters from teachers too.</v>

16
00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:56.400
<v Speaker 1>They're unionized,</v>

17
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.450
<v Speaker 1>which is interesting why they feel so terrified,</v>

18
00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.550
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>

19
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.850
<v Speaker 1>they really feel,</v>

20
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.630
<v Speaker 1>they're sort of feeling like this horrible guilt that you're teaching students</v>

21
00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:05.021
<v Speaker 1>what they know.</v>

22
00:01:05.021 --> 00:01:05.920
<v Speaker 1>They shouldn't be teaching them,</v>

23
00:01:05.921 --> 00:01:09.430
<v Speaker 1>but they don't have any choice but to teach it and they think that it's gotten</v>

24
00:01:09.431 --> 00:01:10.750
<v Speaker 1>worse with the wind government.</v>

25
00:01:10.751 --> 00:01:11.620
<v Speaker 1>What's your sense?</v>

26
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:12.121
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

27
00:01:12.121 --> 00:01:12.601
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

28
00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:13.830
<v Speaker 2>you always have a choice,</v>

29
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.873
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

30
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.600
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

31
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

32
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.320
<v Speaker 2>and the choice might be to stick your neck out and risk and risk being targeted.</v>

33
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.000
<v Speaker 2>My experience has basically been as if you could withstand that and not</v>

34
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:27.930
<v Speaker 2>apologize,</v>

35
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

36
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:30.900
<v Speaker 2>and not backtrack,</v>

37
00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:31.734
<v Speaker 2>then you can,</v>

38
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:32.940
<v Speaker 2>you can weather the storm.</v>

39
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.060
<v Speaker 2>So that's a good thing that people should know.</v>

40
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.130
<v Speaker 2>I think the wind government isn't absolutely reprehensible administration.</v>

41
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.100
<v Speaker 2>It's my fervent with wish that there isn't a single provincial liberal left in</v>

42
00:01:47.101 --> 00:01:48.810
<v Speaker 2>office after the next election.</v>

43
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.950
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

44
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't think she's a liberal at all.</v>

45
00:01:51.481 --> 00:01:54.270
<v Speaker 2>I think she's far left of where the NDP was,</v>

46
00:01:54.271 --> 00:01:55.710
<v Speaker 2>say back in the 1970s.</v>

47
00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:56.160
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

48
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.570
<v Speaker 2>Working Class Organization,</v>

49
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.940
<v Speaker 2>I think she's apart from financially reckless.</v>

50
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.870
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

51
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:04.703
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>

52
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.693
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>

53
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.670
<v Speaker 2>she's dangerous in about six different dimensions.</v>

54
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.580
<v Speaker 2>I think the Ontario human rights commission should be strapped.</v>

55
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.590
<v Speaker 2>Scrapped along with all of strapped.</v>

56
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

57
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:14.803
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

58
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.930
<v Speaker 2>Scrapped along with the social justice tribunals.</v>

59
00:02:18.931 --> 00:02:19.764
<v Speaker 2>There's all sorts of,</v>

60
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.980
<v Speaker 2>I think the legislation that forced the universities to put these quasi judicial</v>

61
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.790
<v Speaker 2>inquisitions in place.</v>

62
00:02:26.791 --> 00:02:30.450
<v Speaker 2>Like the one that raped Lizzy shepherd over the coal should be,</v>

63
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.750
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

64
00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:32.880
<v Speaker 2>should be rescinded.</v>

65
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.283
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

66
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.370
<v Speaker 2>and I do also agree with your initial proposition,</v>

67
00:02:38.371 --> 00:02:43.371
<v Speaker 2>which is that the l the public school system is actually in worse shape than the</v>

68
00:02:43.561 --> 00:02:45.420
<v Speaker 2>universities and it's getting worse.</v>

69
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.510
<v Speaker 2>It's getting worse than it is extraordinarily rapidly.</v>

70
00:02:48.511 --> 00:02:53.511
<v Speaker 2>If you go online to the Elementary Teachers Federation of Ontario website and</v>

71
00:02:54.151 --> 00:02:58.740
<v Speaker 2>read their plans for curriculum development there basically they basically state</v>

72
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.400
<v Speaker 2>forthrightly,</v>

73
00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.600
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

74
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.050
<v Speaker 2>that they're attempting to indoctrinate.</v>

75
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.400
<v Speaker 2>They don't use that word.</v>

76
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.320
<v Speaker 2>Students from kindergarten to grade eight into the social justice ideology.</v>

77
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.980
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

78
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.420
<v Speaker 2>that's the purpose of education as far as they're concerned to rectify the sins</v>

79
00:03:16.421 --> 00:03:18.490
<v Speaker 2>of the past and to bring about equity,</v>

80
00:03:18.491 --> 00:03:21.720
<v Speaker 2>which is of course equity is a,</v>

81
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.470
<v Speaker 2>anybody who talks to you about equity,</v>

82
00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:26.740
<v Speaker 2>you should immediately run away from because they're very dangerous,</v>

83
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.670
<v Speaker 2>ignorant,</v>

84
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.710
<v Speaker 2>historically ignorant and dangerous people.</v>

85
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.981
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

86
00:03:29.981 --> 00:03:30.580
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

87
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:31.413
<v Speaker 2>it's appalling.</v>

88
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make a video for high school kids.</v>

89
00:03:33.341 --> 00:03:36.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to tell them one of the things I would recommend to high school kids</v>

90
00:03:36.821 --> 00:03:39.640
<v Speaker 2>is that as soon as the teacher talks to them about diversity,</v>

91
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.620
<v Speaker 2>equity and inclusiveness,</v>

92
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.911
<v Speaker 2>diversity,</v>

93
00:03:42.911 --> 00:03:44.110
<v Speaker 2>inclusiveness and equity.</v>

94
00:03:44.111 --> 00:03:49.111
<v Speaker 2>So that's an acronym that spells die or white privilege that they should</v>

95
00:03:49.571 --> 00:03:50.950
<v Speaker 2>immediately leave the room.</v>
