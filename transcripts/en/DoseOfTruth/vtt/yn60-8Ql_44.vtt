1
00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:00.350
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

2
00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:00.950
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3
00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:02.840
<v Speaker 1>so the question is,</v>

4
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.200
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean by in forced monogamy?</v>

5
00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.951
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6
00:00:06.951 --> 00:00:07.910
<v Speaker 1>we could start by what?</v>

7
00:00:07.911 --> 00:00:08.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean.</v>

8
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean taking innocent women at gunpoint and handing them over to useless</v>

9
00:00:14.391 --> 00:00:15.224
<v Speaker 1>men,</v>

10
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.170
<v Speaker 1>which is essentially the accusation.</v>

11
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:19.220
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

12
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.380
<v Speaker 1>it was really interesting to watch that on full.</v>

13
00:00:21.381 --> 00:00:25.410
<v Speaker 1>What I meant was that monogamy as,</v>

14
00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.780
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

15
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.590
<v Speaker 1>as something that's socially,</v>

16
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

17
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.020
<v Speaker 1>value is,</v>

18
00:00:30.021 --> 00:00:33.080
<v Speaker 1>it appears to be essentially a human universal.</v>

19
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.500
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean that human beings are universally monogamous because obviously</v>

20
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.291
<v Speaker 1>we're not,</v>

21
00:00:39.291 --> 00:00:43.310
<v Speaker 1>we could be serially monogamous and some people are players and have multiple</v>

22
00:00:43.311 --> 00:00:44.240
<v Speaker 1>partners and all of that,</v>

23
00:00:44.241 --> 00:00:49.241
<v Speaker 1>but there's a strong proclivity across no societies to tilt towards monogamy.</v>

24
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.420
<v Speaker 1>And the enforcement is social norms.</v>

25
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.081
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

26
00:00:57.081 --> 00:00:57.171
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

27
00:00:57.171 --> 00:00:57.891
<v Speaker 1>think about it.</v>

28
00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:58.190
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

29
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.320
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe that I even have to say this.</v>

30
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.490
<v Speaker 1>Your son just gets married and he comes home and he says,</v>

31
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.630
<v Speaker 1>Guess What Dad?</v>

32
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.430
<v Speaker 1>I've been screwing around.</v>

33
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.361
<v Speaker 1>And what do you do with you?</v>

34
00:01:08.361 --> 00:01:09.920
<v Speaker 1>Pat Them on the head when you say,</v>

35
00:01:09.921 --> 00:01:10.251
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

36
00:01:10.251 --> 00:01:11.084
<v Speaker 1>good work kid.</v>

37
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.720
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

38
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.080
<v Speaker 1>that's my young man.</v>

39
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

40
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:15.463
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

41
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.210
<v Speaker 1>you're not happy about that.</v>

42
00:01:17.211 --> 00:01:20.120
<v Speaker 1>And he doesn't tell you because he knows you're not going to be happy about it</v>

43
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.490
<v Speaker 1>and that's in forest monogamy.</v>

44
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.050
<v Speaker 1>It's part of the social structure.</v>

45
00:01:24.051 --> 00:01:25.950
<v Speaker 1>It's like what and what else is enforced?</v>

46
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.551
<v Speaker 1>Monogamy.</v>

47
00:01:26.551 --> 00:01:26.901
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

48
00:01:26.901 --> 00:01:27.061
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

49
00:01:27.061 --> 00:01:31.250
<v Speaker 1>most people want a monogamous relationship and if they enter into a relationship</v>

50
00:01:31.251 --> 00:01:31.670
<v Speaker 1>with someone,</v>

51
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.760
<v Speaker 1>they're not happy if that person goes and sleeps around.</v>

52
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:35.150
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

53
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.831
<v Speaker 1>Most of you do.</v>

54
00:01:35.831 --> 00:01:37.280
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't be happy if that happened.</v>

55
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like not being happy.</v>

56
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.900
<v Speaker 1>That's part of enforced monogamy.</v>

57
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.003
<v Speaker 1>It's part of this.</v>

58
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.340
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

59
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.540
<v Speaker 1>and you might've noticed,</v>

60
00:01:44.541 --> 00:01:45.350
<v Speaker 1>you probably did.</v>

61
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.870
<v Speaker 1>Polygamy is actually illegal.</v>

62
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.180
<v Speaker 1>You can't have multiple America partners,</v>

63
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.120
<v Speaker 1>similar caneously that's enforced monogamy.</v>

64
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.140
<v Speaker 1>That's like in,</v>

65
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.980
<v Speaker 1>and it's an anthropological term.</v>

66
00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.210
<v Speaker 1>It's been known for a hundred years by anthropologists,</v>

67
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.400
<v Speaker 1>most of whom are left bleeding by the way,</v>

68
00:02:01.401 --> 00:02:02.750
<v Speaker 1>because that's how it goes.</v>

69
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.860
<v Speaker 1>Monogamous social structures are one of the ways that you keep children</v>

70
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.780
<v Speaker 1>raised properly so that they have a relatively stable environment and that you</v>

71
00:02:14.781 --> 00:02:16.520
<v Speaker 1>keep male aggression,</v>

72
00:02:16.521 --> 00:02:20.870
<v Speaker 1>especially the aggression of young men under some degree of social control.</v>

73
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.800
<v Speaker 1>It's not a mystery in the fact that I got in trouble for that.</v>

74
00:02:24.801 --> 00:02:24.931
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

75
00:02:24.931 --> 00:02:26.120
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a miracle.</v>

76
00:02:26.121 --> 00:02:26.954
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

77
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.990
<v Speaker 1>don't you notice that we enforce monogamy in like almost every way?</v>

78
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.570
<v Speaker 1>And that the same thing happens all over the world in all sorts of diverse</v>

79
00:02:38.571 --> 00:02:39.404
<v Speaker 1>societies.</v>

80
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.360
<v Speaker 1>And then when we deviate from that,</v>

81
00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:44.990
<v Speaker 1>that there's a price to be paid so and so.</v>

82
00:02:44.991 --> 00:02:49.991
<v Speaker 1>That's why like I'm a New York Times pariah is because I think that monogamy,</v>

83
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.660
<v Speaker 1>all things considered is a good idea.</v>

84
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
