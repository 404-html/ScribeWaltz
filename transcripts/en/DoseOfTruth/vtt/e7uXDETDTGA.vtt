1
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.070
<v Speaker 1>The psychological significance of the biblical stories they've been sold out and</v>

2
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.560
<v Speaker 1>a crazy thing,</v>

3
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.210
<v Speaker 1>the question and answer period at the end has been so sophisticated,</v>

4
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.890
<v Speaker 1>really in depth questions and the audience is really tuned in and very,</v>

5
00:00:22.891 --> 00:00:27.360
<v Speaker 1>very mature and there's so much respect and silence during the entire lecture.</v>

6
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you're very pleased,</v>

7
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.180
<v Speaker 1>but it's amazing.</v>

8
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

9
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm really pleased about it and I've learned a tremendous amount.</v>

10
00:00:33.181 --> 00:00:33.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

11
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.680
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason I wanted to do a series on the psychological significance of</v>

12
00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:39.960
<v Speaker 1>the biblical stories for a long time,</v>

13
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.060
<v Speaker 1>15 years probably,</v>

14
00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:45.770
<v Speaker 1>and never had the opportunity.</v>

15
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.460
<v Speaker 1>You never set itself up properly.</v>

16
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.181
<v Speaker 1>And I've,</v>

17
00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:51.690
<v Speaker 1>I've learned a ridiculous about doing it then I'm really looking forward to</v>

18
00:00:51.691 --> 00:00:52.560
<v Speaker 1>starting it up again.</v>

19
00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:55.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try to do it to go through exodus next year.</v>

20
00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:56.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

21
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.270
<v Speaker 1>I really liked [inaudible] stories and I know the better than I did the</v>

22
00:01:00.271 --> 00:01:01.230
<v Speaker 1>Abrahamic stories,</v>

23
00:01:01.231 --> 00:01:02.064
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

24
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.600
<v Speaker 1>if I had to do a lot of learning,</v>

25
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:04.620
<v Speaker 1>but that's okay.</v>

26
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:05.520
<v Speaker 1>It's often,</v>

27
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.500
<v Speaker 1>it's a funny thing when you're lecturing.</v>

28
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.970
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's,</v>

29
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.691
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

30
00:01:09.691 --> 00:01:14.160
<v Speaker 1>you need to have a fairly wide background of knowledge.</v>

31
00:01:14.161 --> 00:01:15.240
<v Speaker 1>Say that you can draw from,</v>

32
00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:16.074
<v Speaker 1>but in,</v>

33
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.590
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

34
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.950
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

35
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.180
<v Speaker 1>in a more specific way.</v>

36
00:01:18.181 --> 00:01:22.560
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's not bad to be just one step ahead of the audience and be learning</v>

37
00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:25.260
<v Speaker 1>along with them because it keeps the material really fresh.</v>

38
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:26.341
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

39
00:01:26.341 --> 00:01:27.174
<v Speaker 1>that's been,</v>

40
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.650
<v Speaker 1>that's been an amazing thing.</v>

41
00:01:28.651 --> 00:01:31.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many people have watched those biblical lectures now,</v>

42
00:01:31.501 --> 00:01:33.750
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's something upwards of 5 million.</v>

43
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:34.663
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

44
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.580
<v Speaker 1>that's remarkable.</v>

45
00:01:35.581 --> 00:01:36.414
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

46
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.320
<v Speaker 1>what's even more remarkable to me is when I attend is the number of young people</v>

47
00:01:40.321 --> 00:01:41.160
<v Speaker 1>in the audience.</v>

48
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.840
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

49
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.560
<v Speaker 1>that's been really encouraging because I think statistically if we look at</v>

50
00:01:46.561 --> 00:01:47.394
<v Speaker 1>across the board,</v>

51
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.250
<v Speaker 1>I know that young people show not a very strong interest in religion or</v>

52
00:01:53.251 --> 00:01:54.120
<v Speaker 1>religious stories,</v>

53
00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.340
<v Speaker 1>but they certainly don't attend church.</v>

54
00:01:56.341 --> 00:01:58.050
<v Speaker 1>And that's true for young men.</v>

55
00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:02.640
<v Speaker 1>And I know it's really funny because I'm talking to young men about religion and</v>

56
00:02:02.641 --> 00:02:06.510
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and there there's a huge market for it,</v>

57
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.583
<v Speaker 1>which is</v>

58
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:09.773
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>

59
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.040
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me.</v>

60
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.180
<v Speaker 1>It's just amazing.</v>

61
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.510
<v Speaker 1>Unpredictable,</v>

62
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.280
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

63
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.320
<v Speaker 1>A part of me is not surprised because as you know,</v>

64
00:02:19.321 --> 00:02:23.550
<v Speaker 1>I've spent the last 22 years kind of in various types of social services from</v>

65
00:02:23.551 --> 00:02:25.140
<v Speaker 1>child protection to young offenders.</v>

66
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.830
<v Speaker 1>And the one thing I noticed is that people were like starving for some type of</v>

67
00:02:31.531 --> 00:02:35.200
<v Speaker 1>structure and morality and some type of um,</v>

68
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:36.383
<v Speaker 1>sort of,</v>

69
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

70
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.810
<v Speaker 1>way to live their lives in a very meaningful way.</v>

71
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.690
<v Speaker 1>And that hunger was very apparent to me.</v>

72
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.850
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize it was that strong until actually you came along and I saw the</v>

73
00:02:47.851 --> 00:02:50.670
<v Speaker 1>response to worldwide has been phenomenal.</v>

74
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:53.311
<v Speaker 1>It was something,</v>

75
00:02:53.311 --> 00:02:54.240
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to the,</v>

76
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.420
<v Speaker 1>I call them the penguin people because that's actually quite funny.</v>

77
00:02:57.421 --> 00:03:02.421
<v Speaker 1>But I was talking to the penguin people today and David asked me how I can</v>

78
00:03:02.921 --> 00:03:05.610
<v Speaker 1>account for what's happened over the last year,</v>

79
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.453
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

80
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:07.360
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

81
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.550
<v Speaker 1>my sense essentially is that young people haven't been talked intelligently to</v>

82
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.760
<v Speaker 1>about responsibility and tradition since like 1965 and that's three generations.</v>

83
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.320
<v Speaker 1>It's way too long.</v>

84
00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:24.070
<v Speaker 1>And so they are starving for it because we've missed half the story.</v>

85
00:03:24.071 --> 00:03:24.904
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

86
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:25.330
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

87
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.400
<v Speaker 1>they've been fed a diet of nothing but sugar,</v>

88
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.040
<v Speaker 1>freedom and impulsive pleasure and,</v>

89
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:31.413
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

90
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.070
<v Speaker 1>and cynicism about,</v>

91
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.840
<v Speaker 1>about structure and tradition.</v>

92
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.260
<v Speaker 1>And you just can't live like that because freedom and novelty and the unexpected</v>

93
00:03:41.651 --> 00:03:42.520
<v Speaker 1>is half the story.</v>

94
00:03:42.521 --> 00:03:44.980
<v Speaker 1>But structure and predictability and responsibilities,</v>

95
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.701
<v Speaker 1>the other half.</v>

96
00:03:45.701 --> 00:03:46.470
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>

97
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.620
<v Speaker 1>you have to have both,</v>

98
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.940
<v Speaker 1>both halves of the story told no,</v>

99
00:03:49.941 --> 00:03:54.941
<v Speaker 1>your detractors are saying that 90% of your audience is male and most of them</v>

100
00:03:56.141 --> 00:03:57.130
<v Speaker 1>are white male.</v>

101
00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.440
<v Speaker 1>I really don't understand why that's an issue or a private room.</v>

102
00:04:00.441 --> 00:04:01.720
<v Speaker 1>So don't think it's true.</v>

103
00:04:01.721 --> 00:04:02.554
<v Speaker 1>It's funny.</v>

104
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:03.340
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

105
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

106
00:04:03.641 --> 00:04:07.060
<v Speaker 1>I was going through my Twitter followers yesterday because I,</v>

107
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm sending some of the books and I used a program that helped me identify the</v>

108
00:04:13.271 --> 00:04:14.104
<v Speaker 1>most,</v>

109
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.580
<v Speaker 1>sort of a combination of my most influential Twitter followers and also those</v>

110
00:04:18.581 --> 00:04:22.330
<v Speaker 1>who are most likely to be engaged with my material.</v>

111
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.780
<v Speaker 1>And so I identified about 200 of them and you know,</v>

112
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.080
<v Speaker 1>there was some pretty right wing types in there.</v>

113
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:30.183
<v Speaker 1>Three or four of them,</v>

114
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.060
<v Speaker 1>pretty right wing.</v>

115
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:32.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

116
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.220
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

117
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.540
<v Speaker 1>three of them were a transsexual porn stars.</v>

118
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:39.100
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

119
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.620
<v Speaker 1>really interesting because you know,</v>

120
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.470
<v Speaker 1>if you looked at the three kind of radical right wingers,</v>

121
00:04:44.471 --> 00:04:44.891
<v Speaker 1>you'd say,</v>

122
00:04:44.891 --> 00:04:45.370
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

123
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.580
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Peterson attracts radical right wing and followers.</v>

124
00:04:48.581 --> 00:04:49.540
<v Speaker 1>But then,</v>

125
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.961
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

126
00:04:49.961 --> 00:04:50.351
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

127
00:04:50.351 --> 00:04:53.770
<v Speaker 1>what you're going to say about the transsexual porn stars,</v>

128
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.140
<v Speaker 1>literally there were three of them thought,</v>

129
00:04:56.141 --> 00:04:56.740
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

130
00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:57.280
<v Speaker 1>what do I,</v>

131
00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.070
<v Speaker 1>what am I like tarred with the,</v>

132
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.850
<v Speaker 1>with the association transsexual Porn Stars?</v>

133
00:05:03.851 --> 00:05:06.880
<v Speaker 1>Because that seems to be just as as big a group.</v>

134
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:08.223
<v Speaker 1>So it's just,</v>

135
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.160
<v Speaker 1>I think Serina part of what it is is that if you stand up against the radical</v>

136
00:05:12.161 --> 00:05:12.880
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>

137
00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:13.713
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

138
00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.700
<v Speaker 1>then it isn't obvious where you're positioned on the political spectrum because</v>

139
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.300
<v Speaker 1>everybody to the right of the radical left is going to agree with you.</v>

140
00:05:22.301 --> 00:05:24.400
<v Speaker 1>And that'll include people on the radical,</v>

141
00:05:24.401 --> 00:05:25.234
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

142
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.070
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

143
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.360
<v Speaker 1>And then people say,</v>

144
00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:28.481
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

145
00:05:28.481 --> 00:05:28.931
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>

146
00:05:28.931 --> 00:05:30.740
<v Speaker 1>you've got people on the radical right.</v>

147
00:05:30.741 --> 00:05:31.481
<v Speaker 1>Supporting you.</v>

148
00:05:31.481 --> 00:05:32.650
<v Speaker 1>You must be radical.</v>

149
00:05:32.651 --> 00:05:33.011
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

150
00:05:33.011 --> 00:05:34.750
<v Speaker 1>And it's a reasonable question,</v>

151
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:35.613
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

152
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.150
<v Speaker 1>but it's generally not posed in a reasonable way.</v>

153
00:05:38.151 --> 00:05:38.771
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

154
00:05:38.771 --> 00:05:41.410
<v Speaker 1>you obviously you were at the free speech rally.</v>

155
00:05:41.411 --> 00:05:42.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>

156
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:48.100
<v Speaker 1>there was no evidence whatsoever that the crowd we attracted was anything other</v>

157
00:05:48.101 --> 00:05:52.720
<v Speaker 1>than pretty damn stable center of the road.</v>

158
00:05:52.721 --> 00:05:53.290
<v Speaker 1>Citizens.</v>
