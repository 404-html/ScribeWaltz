1
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.530
<v Speaker 1>Don't do the Marxists,</v>

2
00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.980
<v Speaker 1>have sympathy for the working class.</v>

3
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:14.350
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.790
<v Speaker 1>George Orwell was interested in this question and so he wrote this book called</v>

5
00:00:18.791 --> 00:00:20.410
<v Speaker 1>Wagon Road to Wigan pier,</v>

6
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.480
<v Speaker 1>which I would highly recommend it.</v>

7
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.160
<v Speaker 1>It's on a reading list I made.</v>

8
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.300
<v Speaker 1>It's on my website.</v>

9
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:26.440
<v Speaker 1>You can check that out.</v>

10
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.960
<v Speaker 1>Those are books that have been particularly influential to me.</v>

11
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.243
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

12
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.610
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

13
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:31.780
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

14
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:32.980
<v Speaker 1>it was a socialist.</v>

15
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.160
<v Speaker 1>He wrote the book for the Left Book Club,</v>

16
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.810
<v Speaker 1>which published a kind of a socialist book once a month or,</v>

17
00:00:40.811 --> 00:00:41.021
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

18
00:00:41.021 --> 00:00:42.250
<v Speaker 1>by the time he wrote this book,</v>

19
00:00:42.251 --> 00:00:43.990
<v Speaker 1>he was already awake.</v>

20
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.910
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

21
00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:46.200
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

22
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.381
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>

23
00:00:46.381 --> 00:00:50.190
<v Speaker 1>in the 1920s after the Russian revolution,</v>

24
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.780
<v Speaker 1>no one really knew what to make of what was happening in what would become the</v>

25
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.781
<v Speaker 1>Soviet Union.</v>

26
00:00:54.781 --> 00:00:55.300
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

27
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:55.770
<v Speaker 1>Be,</v>

28
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.190
<v Speaker 1>it was after World War One planet was in ashes.</v>

29
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.110
<v Speaker 1>For all intents and purposes,</v>

30
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.680
<v Speaker 1>the old aristocratic order was crumbling.</v>

31
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:06.643
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

32
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.800
<v Speaker 1>It was a horror show.</v>

33
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.460
<v Speaker 1>And these revolutionaries came out with these new ideas and tried to give the in</v>

34
00:01:14.191 --> 00:01:14.850
<v Speaker 1>principle,</v>

35
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.280
<v Speaker 1>give the working class a break and everybody watched to see what would happen</v>

36
00:01:18.281 --> 00:01:19.114
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

37
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.393
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

38
00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.570
<v Speaker 1>The honest people and the intellectuals watched and I separate them for a</v>

39
00:01:25.571 --> 00:01:26.404
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>

40
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.190
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

41
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.590
<v Speaker 1>but by 19 2021,</v>

42
00:01:29.591 --> 00:01:30.071
<v Speaker 1>22,</v>

43
00:01:30.071 --> 00:01:31.150
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

44
00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.020
<v Speaker 1>it was obvious already that something was rotten in the state of Denmark.</v>

45
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.470
<v Speaker 1>Malcolm Muggeridge went over to the Soviet Union to check out how the</v>

46
00:01:38.471 --> 00:01:42.190
<v Speaker 1>collectivization of the farms was going and he found out it was actually pretty</v>

47
00:01:42.191 --> 00:01:43.024
<v Speaker 1>murderous,</v>

48
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.381
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

49
00:01:44.381 --> 00:01:45.130
<v Speaker 1>Because what this,</v>

50
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.610
<v Speaker 1>what the Communists did was round up all the successful farmers and rape them</v>

51
00:01:48.611 --> 00:01:51.610
<v Speaker 1>and kill them and steal everything they had and send them off to Siberia,</v>

52
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.460
<v Speaker 1>which turned out actually to be a pretty bad idea.</v>

53
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.010
<v Speaker 1>Now you think you think about it,</v>

54
00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.100
<v Speaker 1>those people were serfs not very long before,</v>

55
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.810
<v Speaker 1>a couple of generations at most.</v>

56
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.940
<v Speaker 1>And they were so not much more than slaves.</v>

57
00:02:03.941 --> 00:02:07.540
<v Speaker 1>And some of them had risen up to the point where to me it had a nice brick house</v>

58
00:02:07.541 --> 00:02:10.210
<v Speaker 1>and a couple of cows and maybe a person working for them or too,</v>

59
00:02:10.211 --> 00:02:15.160
<v Speaker 1>and there was a small proportion of the agriculturalists in the Soviet Union</v>

60
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.320
<v Speaker 1>that we're producing most of the food.</v>

61
00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.520
<v Speaker 1>And that's just how it goes.</v>

62
00:02:18.521 --> 00:02:20.710
<v Speaker 1>Because that's a Prieto distribution issue.</v>

63
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.280
<v Speaker 1>In any field where there's human productivity,</v>

64
00:02:24.281 --> 00:02:27.280
<v Speaker 1>a small proportion of the people produce almost all of the output.</v>

65
00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.910
<v Speaker 1>It's actually the square root of the number of people in the field produce half</v>

66
00:02:30.911 --> 00:02:31.630
<v Speaker 1>the output.</v>

67
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.770
<v Speaker 1>So if you have a hundred farmers,</v>

68
00:02:32.771 --> 00:02:34.270
<v Speaker 1>10 of them produce half the food.</v>

69
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.100
<v Speaker 1>But if you have 10,000 to a hundred of them,</v>

70
00:02:36.101 --> 00:02:37.150
<v Speaker 1>produce half the food.</v>

71
00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.441
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

72
00:02:38.441 --> 00:02:41.170
<v Speaker 1>So what happens when you kill all the good farmers,</v>

73
00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.180
<v Speaker 1>you starve 6 million Ukrainians to death in the 1930s.</v>

74
00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:47.321
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

75
00:02:47.321 --> 00:02:49.450
<v Speaker 1>that's not something that's all that widely known.</v>

76
00:02:49.451 --> 00:02:50.650
<v Speaker 1>But if you want to,</v>

77
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.003
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

78
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.150
<v Speaker 1>provide some additional fodder for your nightmares,</v>

79
00:02:55.151 --> 00:02:59.080
<v Speaker 1>you could go online and read about what happened to the Ukrainians in the 1930s</v>

80
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.320
<v Speaker 1>so that underneath the,</v>

81
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.670
<v Speaker 1>under the collectivization principles,</v>

82
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.150
<v Speaker 1>so let's say you were a mother and you were starving to death and so are your</v>

83
00:03:07.151 --> 00:03:07.631
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>

84
00:03:07.631 --> 00:03:08.800
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

85
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.890
<v Speaker 1>the communists had come in and forcibly collectivized you.</v>

86
00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:15.340
<v Speaker 1>And then they took all the grain that your collective farm had produced and they</v>

87
00:03:15.341 --> 00:03:16.430
<v Speaker 1>shipped it all to the city,</v>

88
00:03:16.431 --> 00:03:16.711
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

89
00:03:16.711 --> 00:03:17.980
<v Speaker 1>and so that's all done.</v>

90
00:03:17.981 --> 00:03:18.491
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>

91
00:03:18.491 --> 00:03:18.911
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

92
00:03:18.911 --> 00:03:23.911
<v Speaker 1>you know the city's got eat and so then you go out in the field to pick up the</v>

93
00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:26.800
<v Speaker 1>grains that the harvesters missed so that you can,</v>

94
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:27.131
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

95
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:28.780
<v Speaker 1>the ones that they'd been lying there,</v>

96
00:03:28.781 --> 00:03:29.770
<v Speaker 1>they're not so good.</v>

97
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.940
<v Speaker 1>There's not that many of them.</v>

98
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.170
<v Speaker 1>You go out and glean,</v>

99
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.570
<v Speaker 1>you pick up the seeds that weren't picked up.</v>

100
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.740
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

101
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.900
<v Speaker 1>so you can feed your kids so they don't die.</v>

102
00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.810
<v Speaker 1>And so what's the punishment for that death?</v>

103
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.210
<v Speaker 1>Because you were obliged under the collectivization orders to turn in any</v>

104
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.710
<v Speaker 1>additional grains that you happen to pick off the ground to the authorities so</v>

105
00:03:50.711 --> 00:03:51.670
<v Speaker 1>that they could be,</v>

106
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.020
<v Speaker 1>well who knows,</v>

107
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.393
<v Speaker 1>but at least so you,</v>

108
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.020
<v Speaker 1>so they could be shipped to the cities,</v>

109
00:03:56.021 --> 00:03:56.621
<v Speaker 1>I suppose,</v>

110
00:03:56.621 --> 00:03:59.560
<v Speaker 1>which is of course absurd because of course that would never happen,</v>

111
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.680
<v Speaker 1>but it was mostly so that you could just actually die.</v>

112
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:04.271
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

113
00:04:04.271 --> 00:04:05.104
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

114
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.131
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

115
00:04:06.131 --> 00:04:08.140
<v Speaker 1>back to the road to Wigan pier now.</v>

116
00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:12.520
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

117
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to read you a little bit about,</v>

118
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.400
<v Speaker 1>about from the book.</v>

119
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.430
<v Speaker 1>So or well went out to this mining town in the northern UK and coal miners.</v>

120
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.780
<v Speaker 1>Orwell had sympathy for the working class.</v>

121
00:04:25.781 --> 00:04:29.380
<v Speaker 1>He really worked on that his whole life cause he was a middle class,</v>

122
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.420
<v Speaker 1>upper middle class,</v>

123
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.640
<v Speaker 1>snobby type Englishman.</v>

124
00:04:33.641 --> 00:04:34.480
<v Speaker 1>And he knew it.</v>

125
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

126
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.690
<v Speaker 1>and he tried really hard to overcome that.</v>

127
00:04:37.691 --> 00:04:38.160
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

128
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.860
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

129
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.050
<v Speaker 1>he served in the Spanish civil war.</v>

130
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.060
<v Speaker 1>He wandered around as a tramp.</v>

131
00:04:43.061 --> 00:04:43.860
<v Speaker 1>He worked in,</v>

132
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:44.090
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

133
00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.340
<v Speaker 1>in low end restaurant.</v>

134
00:04:45.341 --> 00:04:48.850
<v Speaker 1>He worked as a low end worker in restaurants in Paris and in London.</v>

135
00:04:48.851 --> 00:04:50.500
<v Speaker 1>He has a very good book,</v>

136
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.400
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called down and out in Paris and London that describes that he was</v>

137
00:04:54.401 --> 00:04:57.460
<v Speaker 1>seriously committed dude and really a smart guy.</v>

138
00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.330
<v Speaker 1>And so he's going up to these terrible towns in the northern UK where the coal</v>

139
00:05:03.671 --> 00:05:06.280
<v Speaker 1>miners worked and have their families and you know,</v>

140
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.720
<v Speaker 1>they had hard lives.</v>

141
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.190
<v Speaker 1>They had hard lives.</v>

142
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.780
<v Speaker 1>And that's just saying nothing.</v>

143
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.770
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

144
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.690
<v Speaker 1>the coal miners that he met,</v>

145
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.210
<v Speaker 1>they didn't have any teeth by the time they were 30.</v>

146
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.440
<v Speaker 1>He said the women he talked to said teeth or just a misery.</v>

147
00:05:20.441 --> 00:05:22.660
<v Speaker 1>It's better to get rid of them as soon as you can.</v>

148
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:24.003
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

149
00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.551
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

150
00:05:24.551 --> 00:05:24.941
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

151
00:05:24.941 --> 00:05:28.390
<v Speaker 1>and they went and the man went and mined coal and that was rough.</v>

152
00:05:28.391 --> 00:05:28.631
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

153
00:05:28.631 --> 00:05:31.630
<v Speaker 1>they all have black lung by the time they were 40 and they were,</v>

154
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.220
<v Speaker 1>they were done fundamentally.</v>

155
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.200
<v Speaker 1>But here's a,</v>

156
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.000
<v Speaker 1>just a bit,</v>

157
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.990
<v Speaker 1>a bit of a story about how hard their lives were.</v>

158
00:05:37.991 --> 00:05:42.991
<v Speaker 1>So they had to go in the minds during the day so that they never saw the day.</v>

159
00:05:43.571 --> 00:05:44.440
<v Speaker 1>So that's one thing.</v>

160
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.700
<v Speaker 1>They had to go to the mines and then they have,</v>

161
00:05:45.701 --> 00:05:48.400
<v Speaker 1>they'd like narc coal off the walls.</v>

162
00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:52.300
<v Speaker 1>That's hard with hammers and picks and all of that and they had to move it.</v>

163
00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:53.613
<v Speaker 1>But that was,</v>

164
00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:54.670
<v Speaker 1>that was their job.</v>

165
00:05:54.671 --> 00:05:56.170
<v Speaker 1>But there was the commute.</v>

166
00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:57.560
<v Speaker 1>So here was the commute.</v>

167
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.290
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that the typical tunnel was about that high,</v>

168
00:06:00.291 --> 00:06:01.310
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

169
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.710
<v Speaker 1>And the typical coal miner was about that high.</v>

170
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.970
<v Speaker 1>Lots of problem.</v>

171
00:06:04.971 --> 00:06:05.091
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>

172
00:06:05.091 --> 00:06:07.280
<v Speaker 1>because you've got to walk through those titles to get to work.</v>

173
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:08.780
<v Speaker 1>So you have to walk like this.</v>

174
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.190
<v Speaker 1>Then the question might be,</v>

175
00:06:10.191 --> 00:06:12.620
<v Speaker 1>well how far do you have to walk to work?</v>

176
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.720
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is three and a half miles.</v>

177
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:19.130
<v Speaker 1>And that's how far you have to walk back from work after you've put your eight</v>

178
00:06:19.131 --> 00:06:23.240
<v Speaker 1>hour shift and at the coal mine and the you don't get paid for the commute.</v>

179
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:28.570
<v Speaker 1>And so or well said that was more or less like climbing a small mountain in the</v>

180
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:32.780
<v Speaker 1>morning before you went to work and then climbing another one at night before</v>

181
00:06:32.781 --> 00:06:33.614
<v Speaker 1>you went home.</v>

182
00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.330
<v Speaker 1>And so that was just,</v>

183
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

184
00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.801
<v Speaker 1>believe me,</v>

185
00:06:36.801 --> 00:06:39.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you very little about how tough their lives were,</v>

186
00:06:39.501 --> 00:06:41.000
<v Speaker 1>but that gives you a little flavor.</v>

187
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.220
<v Speaker 1>I said one day like that for a modern person,</v>

188
00:06:43.221 --> 00:06:46.160
<v Speaker 1>you're just your dad k or you wish you were dead anyways.</v>

189
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:51.760
<v Speaker 1>And so Orwell talks about going up there to stay and terrible places he lived in</v>

190
00:06:52.971 --> 00:06:55.010
<v Speaker 1>while he was up there and the terrible food he ate and,</v>

191
00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.710
<v Speaker 1>and the miserable and wretched scenes that he saw.</v>

192
00:06:57.711 --> 00:06:59.870
<v Speaker 1>And here's one of the miserable wretched scenes.</v>

193
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.140
<v Speaker 1>He's on a train through the neighborhoods.</v>

194
00:07:03.141 --> 00:07:03.441
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

195
00:07:03.441 --> 00:07:07.700
<v Speaker 1>the train bore me away through the monster scenery of slag heaps,</v>

196
00:07:07.701 --> 00:07:10.490
<v Speaker 1>chimneys piled scrap iron follow of canals,</v>

197
00:07:10.491 --> 00:07:12.110
<v Speaker 1>paths of cindery mud,</v>

198
00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:14.300
<v Speaker 1>criss cross by the Prince of clogs.</v>

199
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:15.380
<v Speaker 1>This was march,</v>

200
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:20.140
<v Speaker 1>but the weather had been horribly cold and everywhere there were mounds of black</v>

201
00:07:20.141 --> 00:07:21.350
<v Speaker 1>and snow.</v>

202
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:24.170
<v Speaker 1>As we move slowly through the outskirts of the town,</v>

203
00:07:24.171 --> 00:07:29.171
<v Speaker 1>we passed row after row of little gray slum houses running at right angles to</v>

204
00:07:29.181 --> 00:07:32.590
<v Speaker 1>the embankment at the back of one of the houses.</v>

205
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.680
<v Speaker 1>A young woman was kneeling on the stones poking a stick up the lead and waste</v>

206
00:07:36.681 --> 00:07:38.900
<v Speaker 1>pipe which ran from the sink inside,</v>

207
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:40.760
<v Speaker 1>which I suppose was blocked.</v>

208
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:43.370
<v Speaker 1>I had time to see everything about her.</v>

209
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.610
<v Speaker 1>Her sack apron or clumsy clogs her arms.</v>

210
00:07:46.611 --> 00:07:47.960
<v Speaker 1>Reddened by the cold.</v>

211
00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:52.760
<v Speaker 1>She looked up as the train passed and I was almost near enough to catch your</v>

212
00:07:52.761 --> 00:07:53.594
<v Speaker 1>eye.</v>

213
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:55.760
<v Speaker 1>She had around Pale face,</v>

214
00:07:55.950 --> 00:08:00.500
<v Speaker 1>the usual exhausted face of the slum girl who's 25 and looks 40 thanks to</v>

215
00:08:00.501 --> 00:08:05.480
<v Speaker 1>miscarriages and drudgery and at war for the second in which I sought the most</v>

216
00:08:05.481 --> 00:08:06.081
<v Speaker 1>desolate,</v>

217
00:08:06.081 --> 00:08:08.330
<v Speaker 1>hopeless expression I've ever seen.</v>

218
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:10.371
<v Speaker 1>It struck me.</v>

219
00:08:10.371 --> 00:08:13.460
<v Speaker 1>Then we meaning the middle class at that time,</v>

220
00:08:13.461 --> 00:08:14.041
<v Speaker 1>our mistake,</v>

221
00:08:14.041 --> 00:08:18.510
<v Speaker 1>and when we say that it isn't the same for them as it would be for us and the</v>

222
00:08:18.511 --> 00:08:22.700
<v Speaker 1>people bread in the slums can imagine nothing but the slums for what I saw on</v>

223
00:08:22.701 --> 00:08:25.850
<v Speaker 1>her face was by no means the ignorant suffering of an animal.</v>

224
00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:28.160
<v Speaker 1>She knew well enough what was happening to her,</v>

225
00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.110
<v Speaker 1>understood as well as I did,</v>

226
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:33.810
<v Speaker 1>how dreadful a destiny it was to be kneeling there in the bitter cold on the</v>

227
00:08:33.811 --> 00:08:38.811
<v Speaker 1>slimy stones of a slum backyard poking a stick up of followed drain pipe.</v>

228
00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.113
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

229
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:43.383
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

230
00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:48.950
<v Speaker 1>Orwell rates the first part of the book and it details the lives of these people</v>

231
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:51.140
<v Speaker 1>and then he makes an argument,</v>

232
00:08:51.141 --> 00:08:51.771
<v Speaker 1>he says like,</v>

233
00:08:51.771 --> 00:08:52.910
<v Speaker 1>how can you read about this?</v>

234
00:08:52.911 --> 00:08:56.610
<v Speaker 1>How can you know about this without having sympathy for</v>

235
00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:02.410
<v Speaker 1>redistribution schemes and social and socialist ideas?</v>

236
00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:05.620
<v Speaker 1>And so he's actually asking himself this question.</v>

237
00:09:05.621 --> 00:09:07.330
<v Speaker 1>It's not just a rhetorical question.</v>

238
00:09:07.331 --> 00:09:08.140
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

239
00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:08.321
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

240
00:09:08.321 --> 00:09:09.310
<v Speaker 1>he's a serious guy,</v>

241
00:09:09.311 --> 00:09:09.551
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

242
00:09:09.551 --> 00:09:09.850
<v Speaker 1>He went,</v>

243
00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:13.810
<v Speaker 1>he goes up there and he tells you a story that you have to have a heart of</v>

244
00:09:13.811 --> 00:09:14.531
<v Speaker 1>stone.</v>

245
00:09:14.531 --> 00:09:14.861
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

246
00:09:14.861 --> 00:09:15.401
<v Speaker 1>if you don't,</v>

247
00:09:15.401 --> 00:09:15.971
<v Speaker 1>if you read that,</v>

248
00:09:15.971 --> 00:09:16.541
<v Speaker 1>you don't think,</v>

249
00:09:16.541 --> 00:09:16.841
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

250
00:09:16.841 --> 00:09:18.040
<v Speaker 1>something should be done about this.</v>

251
00:09:18.041 --> 00:09:19.150
<v Speaker 1>It's really awful.</v>

252
00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:24.360
<v Speaker 1>So he set up this situation where your sympathies are completely with the people</v>

253
00:09:25.991 --> 00:09:27.070
<v Speaker 1>that he's describing.</v>

254
00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:32.000
<v Speaker 1>But socialism wasn't all that popular in Britain at that time.</v>

255
00:09:32.001 --> 00:09:32.630
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

256
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:33.470
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

257
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:37.040
<v Speaker 1>and socialists weren't all that popular with Orwell.</v>

258
00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:40.520
<v Speaker 1>He didn't really like them that much and he was trying to figure out why that</v>

259
00:09:40.521 --> 00:09:41.354
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

260
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:44.513
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

261
00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:46.760
<v Speaker 1>So this is what he wrote in the second part of the book.</v>

262
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:47.361
<v Speaker 1>Now this God,</v>

263
00:09:47.361 --> 00:09:48.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm in a lot of trouble.</v>

264
00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:52.370
<v Speaker 1>They didn't want to publish this damn book after we wrote the second part.</v>

265
00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.153
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

266
00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:58.690
<v Speaker 1>but he fought with him and he got it published and it's a classic and people</v>

267
00:09:58.691 --> 00:10:02.130
<v Speaker 1>still read it and you should read it because it's a great book and Orwell's a</v>

268
00:10:02.131 --> 00:10:03.040
<v Speaker 1>great writer.</v>

269
00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:07.540
<v Speaker 1>And we're well as another one of those people and intellectuals who woke up</v>

270
00:10:07.541 --> 00:10:08.141
<v Speaker 1>pretty early,</v>

271
00:10:08.141 --> 00:10:08.471
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

272
00:10:08.471 --> 00:10:13.471
<v Speaker 1>or well wrote animal farm in 1984 he wrote in 1984 in 1948 wrote animal farm</v>

273
00:10:15.491 --> 00:10:17.230
<v Speaker 1>approximately around the same time.</v>

274
00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:19.720
<v Speaker 1>He knew what was happening under Stalin.</v>

275
00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:21.760
<v Speaker 1>And he wasn't afraid to say it,</v>

276
00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:26.140
<v Speaker 1>but it was a message that in some sense fell on deaf ears,</v>

277
00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:28.270
<v Speaker 1>especially among the intelligentsia.</v>

278
00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.160
<v Speaker 1>And there's complicated reasons for that.</v>

279
00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:30.821
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

280
00:10:30.821 --> 00:10:31.654
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

281
00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:35.230
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't like the facts weren't there for people to see them if they wanted</v>

282
00:10:35.231 --> 00:10:35.650
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

283
00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:39.070
<v Speaker 1>And has already said Muggeridge Malcolm Muggeridge had made it pretty clear in</v>

284
00:10:39.071 --> 00:10:41.860
