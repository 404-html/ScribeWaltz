00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:02.323
<v Speaker 1>Are you,</v>

2
00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:06.150
<v Speaker 1>I did a lot of counseling work with people who were coaching work,</v>

3
00:00:06.151 --> 00:00:10.290
<v Speaker 1>I guess with people who were fairly spectacularly successful and they were</v>

4
00:00:10.291 --> 00:00:11.780
<v Speaker 1>usually workaholics,</v>

5
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:11.971
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6
00:00:11.971 --> 00:00:13.350
<v Speaker 1>they're the sort of people that were like,</v>

7
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.570
<v Speaker 1>they'd work 80 hours a week just nonstop.</v>

8
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:16.770
<v Speaker 1>That's just what they were like.</v>

9
00:00:16.771 --> 00:00:19.230
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things we were always trying to figure out was,</v>

10
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:19.591
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

11
00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:20.730
<v Speaker 1>how much should you work?</v>

12
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.790
<v Speaker 1>Because one answers you'd just work til you die,</v>

13
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:24.091
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

14
00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:25.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean he just exhaust yourself.</v>

15
00:00:25.861 --> 00:00:27.090
<v Speaker 1>And while that's not,</v>

16
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.620
<v Speaker 1>that's not a good idea.</v>

17
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.440
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to figure out why that isn't a good idea.</v>

18
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.700
<v Speaker 1>It's gotta be something like this is that you don't want to do so much work that</v>

19
00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:38.520
<v Speaker 1>the amount of work you do interferes with the amount of work that you could</v>

20
00:00:38.521 --> 00:00:39.570
<v Speaker 1>still do.</v>

21
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:40.950
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

22
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.540
<v Speaker 1>Because if you work like mad for two weeks and then you,</v>

23
00:00:43.541 --> 00:00:43.820
<v Speaker 1>you like,</v>

24
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.290
<v Speaker 1>you have to lie in a hospital bed for a month,</v>

25
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.120
<v Speaker 1>that obviously isn't very productive.</v>

26
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.740
<v Speaker 1>So you have to figure out how much you can work diligently and then how much you</v>

27
00:00:52.741 --> 00:00:55.890
<v Speaker 1>have to recuperate so that you can get back up and work again.</v>

28
00:00:55.891 --> 00:00:56.400
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

29
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.821
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

30
00:00:56.821 --> 00:01:00.690
<v Speaker 1>people have basically settled on something like this and given it the divine</v>

31
00:01:00.691 --> 00:01:02.820
<v Speaker 1>imprimatur that that's one way of thinking about it,</v>

32
00:01:02.821 --> 00:01:03.810
<v Speaker 1>which is well,</v>

33
00:01:03.811 --> 00:01:06.960
<v Speaker 1>you can toil away for six days and no wonder because you have to work,</v>

34
00:01:06.961 --> 00:01:10.410
<v Speaker 1>but you should rest at least one day out of seven because otherwise,</v>

35
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.630
<v Speaker 1>well you don't appreciate life.</v>

36
00:01:12.631 --> 00:01:13.750
<v Speaker 1>That might be part of it.</v>

37
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.520
<v Speaker 1>And plus I think it's more a matter of iterative interability you know,</v>

38
00:01:17.521 --> 00:01:21.540
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things that defines morality is the capacity to repeat</v>

39
00:01:21.541 --> 00:01:22.374
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

40
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.801
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

41
00:01:22.801 --> 00:01:25.920
<v Speaker 1>So if something is properly structured in a moral manner,</v>

42
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.220
<v Speaker 1>then you can do it over and over and over again without any degeneration.</v>

43
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.380
<v Speaker 1>And so that's kind of like a relationship.</v>

44
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.270
<v Speaker 1>If your relationship isn't negotiated,</v>

45
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.810
<v Speaker 1>you can continue to negotiate it and then you can have a relationship that lasts</v>

46
00:01:36.811 --> 00:01:37.441
<v Speaker 1>for a long time.</v>

47
00:01:37.441 --> 00:01:40.090
<v Speaker 1>You can do it today and next week and next month,</v>

48
00:01:40.091 --> 00:01:40.860
<v Speaker 1>the next year.</v>

49
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.720
<v Speaker 1>You could maintain it across time.</v>

50
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.381
<v Speaker 1>And this,</v>

51
00:01:43.381 --> 00:01:47.940
<v Speaker 1>I would say is the wisdom that's been associate that's been garnered over God</v>

52
00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:50.070
<v Speaker 1>only knows what period of time to say,</v>

53
00:01:50.071 --> 00:01:50.400
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

54
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.701
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

55
00:01:50.701 --> 00:01:51.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

56
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.720
<v Speaker 1>even God needed to take a break and appreciate what was going on and it's not</v>

57
00:01:54.721 --> 00:01:56.510
<v Speaker 1>such a bad thing for people to follow that,</v>

58
00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:57.690
<v Speaker 1>that pattern.</v>

59
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.780
<v Speaker 1>That's a good thing for modern people to know because we seem to be,</v>

60
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.400
<v Speaker 1>even though you know,</v>

61
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.310
<v Speaker 1>we're very wealthy by historical standards,</v>

62
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.190
<v Speaker 1>our capacity to relax isn't exactly what it could be.</v>

63
00:02:08.191 --> 00:02:09.780
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's really hard on people.</v>
