1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.700
<v Speaker 1>People turn to possession by very,</v>

2
00:00:02.701 --> 00:00:04.800
<v Speaker 1>very strict ideological ideas.</v>

3
00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:05.460
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

4
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.450
<v Speaker 1>they were willing to be possessed by those ideas to the point where they would</v>

5
00:00:09.451 --> 00:00:13.410
<v Speaker 1>undertake actions that you'd think would be completely impossible for</v>

6
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.660
<v Speaker 1>theoretically civilized people.</v>

7
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:16.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

8
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.210
<v Speaker 1>it turned out that those actions,</v>

9
00:00:18.211 --> 00:00:18.661
<v Speaker 1>not only,</v>

10
00:00:18.661 --> 00:00:21.390
<v Speaker 1>we're not impossible for civilized people,</v>

11
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.880
<v Speaker 1>but that the people themselves,</v>

12
00:00:23.881 --> 00:00:24.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.650
<v Speaker 1>especially in Nazi Germany,</v>

14
00:00:25.651 --> 00:00:27.690
<v Speaker 1>they pretty much knew what the hell was going on.</v>

15
00:00:27.691 --> 00:00:28.230
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

16
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.980
<v Speaker 1>you don't take several million people out of your population without rumors</v>

17
00:00:31.981 --> 00:00:32.611
<v Speaker 1>spreading,</v>

18
00:00:32.611 --> 00:00:33.444
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

19
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:34.171
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

20
00:00:34.171 --> 00:00:34.411
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:00:34.411 --> 00:00:36.510
<v Speaker 1>we should never forget that Hitler was elected,</v>

22
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.991
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:00:36.991 --> 00:00:39.420
<v Speaker 1>and he was elected by a large margin majority too.</v>

24
00:00:39.421 --> 00:00:40.680
<v Speaker 1>It was a landslide vote.</v>

25
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.190
<v Speaker 1>The kind of vote that no modern democratic leader ever gets.</v>

26
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.593
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

27
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.741
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

28
00:00:46.741 --> 00:00:48.210
<v Speaker 1>although it's difficult to,</v>

29
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.460
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult for people to swallow.</v>

30
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.593
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

31
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.320
<v Speaker 1>it's hard not to assign culpability for what happened in Germany to the society</v>

32
00:00:59.671 --> 00:01:00.990
<v Speaker 1>at every strata.</v>

33
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.240
<v Speaker 1>You can't just dump it on the leaders.</v>

34
00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.293
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>

35
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:05.880
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that,</v>

36
00:01:05.881 --> 00:01:06.421
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>

37
00:01:06.421 --> 00:01:08.550
<v Speaker 1>here's something to think about with regards to Hitler.</v>

38
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:09.121
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

39
00:01:09.121 --> 00:01:10.800
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things you might ask is,</v>

40
00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:12.360
<v Speaker 1>how the hell could he be so,</v>

41
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.830
<v Speaker 1>so absolutely compelling to his audiences.</v>

42
00:01:16.831 --> 00:01:17.220
<v Speaker 1>But here,</v>

43
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:17.311
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

44
00:01:17.311 --> 00:01:18.630
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you an explanation.</v>

45
00:01:18.631 --> 00:01:19.590
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>

46
00:01:19.591 --> 00:01:20.424
<v Speaker 1>let's make the,</v>

47
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.840
<v Speaker 1>let's make a few assumptions.</v>

48
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.430
<v Speaker 1>The first assumption is there are a lot of resentful Germans kicking around.</v>

49
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:27.713
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

50
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

51
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.970
<v Speaker 1>they lost the first world war.</v>

52
00:01:29.971 --> 00:01:30.870
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't so good.</v>

53
00:01:30.871 --> 00:01:34.680
<v Speaker 1>And then there were a lot of brutal man left because they'd been in the trenches</v>

54
00:01:34.681 --> 00:01:35.514
<v Speaker 1>and they'd been shooting,</v>

55
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.520
<v Speaker 1>fighting and shooting at each other under absolutely a Borat conditions for like</v>

56
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.921
<v Speaker 1>years and years.</v>

57
00:01:40.921 --> 00:01:43.050
<v Speaker 1>And so there were plenty of brutalized men around.</v>

58
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.453
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

59
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.210
<v Speaker 1>and then their whole damned economy collapsed because they were forced into</v>

60
00:01:48.211 --> 00:01:51.990
<v Speaker 1>signing what historians regard is a very punitive peace treaty.</v>

61
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.651
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

62
00:01:52.651 --> 00:01:53.430
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

63
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.480
<v Speaker 1>everything had fallen apart to a degree that we can't even begin to imagine.</v>

64
00:01:57.481 --> 00:01:58.290
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

65
00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

66
00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:59.880
<v Speaker 1>in the 1930s,</v>

67
00:01:59.881 --> 00:02:02.130
<v Speaker 1>the Germans were starting to get back on their feet and,</v>

68
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.940
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

69
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:03.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

70
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.560
<v Speaker 1>when Hitler came to power,</v>

71
00:02:04.561 --> 00:02:07.980
<v Speaker 1>he started not only to rearm but to reindustrialization the economy.</v>

72
00:02:07.981 --> 00:02:09.600
<v Speaker 1>And he was actually pretty damn good at that.</v>

73
00:02:09.601 --> 00:02:12.270
<v Speaker 1>So now Hitler was a good orator,</v>

74
00:02:12.271 --> 00:02:13.020
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

75
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.853
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

76
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.500
<v Speaker 1>it isn't exactly clear that he was a,</v>

77
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.980
<v Speaker 1>a coherent philosophical fear riser.</v>

78
00:02:19.981 --> 00:02:23.520
<v Speaker 1>Although to think of him as stupid as it is completely missing the point,</v>

79
00:02:23.521 --> 00:02:24.870
<v Speaker 1>he was by no means stupid.</v>

80
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

81
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.410
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say that he was particularly educated,</v>

82
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.000
<v Speaker 1>but he had a very powerfully developed aesthetic sense and he spent a lot of his</v>

83
00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:36.900
<v Speaker 1>time designing the cities that would be built after World War II was over in</v>

84
00:02:36.901 --> 00:02:39.630
<v Speaker 1>those cities were generally conceptualized by him,</v>

85
00:02:39.631 --> 00:02:41.550
<v Speaker 1>has places where the arts,</v>

86
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.580
<v Speaker 1>or at least the Nazi version of the arts could flourish.</v>

87
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:45.211
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

88
00:02:45.211 --> 00:02:49.320
<v Speaker 1>so there's no real evidence that what was wrong with the Nazis was that they</v>

89
00:02:49.321 --> 00:02:50.520
<v Speaker 1>were civilized.</v>

90
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:51.750
<v Speaker 1>There's more evidence,</v>

91
00:02:51.751 --> 00:02:52.141
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

92
00:02:52.141 --> 00:02:53.700
<v Speaker 1>I think that they were two civil civilized.</v>
