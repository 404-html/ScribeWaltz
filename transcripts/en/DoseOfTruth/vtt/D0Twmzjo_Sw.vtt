1
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.120
<v Speaker 1>And the sons of Noah that went forth of the Ark were Shem and ham and Japheth.</v>

2
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.980
<v Speaker 1>And Ham is the father of Canaan.</v>

3
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.780
<v Speaker 1>These are the three sons of Noah and of them was the whole earth.</v>

4
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.020
<v Speaker 1>Overspread and Noah began to be a HUD husbands men.</v>

5
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.940
<v Speaker 1>And he planted a vineyard and he drank of the wine and was drunk.</v>

6
00:00:25.941 --> 00:00:26.090
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

7
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.240
<v Speaker 1>and he was uncovered within his tent and Ham.</v>

8
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.890
<v Speaker 1>The father of Canaan saw the nakedness of his father and told his two brethren</v>

9
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.023
<v Speaker 1>without,</v>

10
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.441
<v Speaker 1>and Shem,</v>

11
00:00:36.441 --> 00:00:40.070
<v Speaker 1>and Japheth took a garment and laid upon both their shoulders and went backward</v>

12
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.990
<v Speaker 1>and covered the nakedness of their father.</v>

13
00:00:41.991 --> 00:00:43.220
<v Speaker 1>And their faces were backward,</v>

14
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.860
<v Speaker 1>and they saw not their father's nakedness.</v>

15
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.910
<v Speaker 1>And Noah awoke from his wine and knew what his younger son had done unto him.</v>

16
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:51.283
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

17
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.670
<v Speaker 1>curse had to be Canaan,</v>

18
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.000
<v Speaker 1>a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.</v>

19
00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:58.451
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

20
00:00:58.451 --> 00:01:00.870
<v Speaker 1>blessed shall be the Lord God of Shaman.</v>

21
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.170
<v Speaker 1>Canaan shall be his servant,</v>

22
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.360
<v Speaker 1>and God shall enlarge Japheth.</v>

23
00:01:04.361 --> 00:01:06.280
<v Speaker 1>And he shall dwell in the tents of Shem.</v>

24
00:01:06.281 --> 00:01:07.720
<v Speaker 1>And Canaan shall be his servant.</v>

25
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.210
<v Speaker 1>And Noah lived after the flood,</v>

26
00:01:10.211 --> 00:01:14.560
<v Speaker 1>350 years and all the days of Noah were 950 years and he died</v>

27
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.950
<v Speaker 1>and the whole earth was of one language and of one speech.</v>

28
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.431
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

29
00:01:19.431 --> 00:01:20.264
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

30
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.500
<v Speaker 1>I remember thinking about this story,</v>

31
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.800
<v Speaker 1>it's gotta be 30 years ago</v>

32
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.270
<v Speaker 1>and I think the meaning of the story stood out for me.</v>

33
00:01:34.271 --> 00:01:38.080
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes when you read complicated materials,</v>

34
00:01:38.081 --> 00:01:39.850
<v Speaker 1>sometimes a piece of it will stand out.</v>

35
00:01:39.851 --> 00:01:42.550
<v Speaker 1>It's for some reason it's like it glitters.</v>

36
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.530
<v Speaker 1>I suppose that might be one way of thinking about it.</v>

37
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.690
<v Speaker 1>It's it,</v>

38
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.300
<v Speaker 1>you're in sync with it and you can understand what it means.</v>

39
00:01:49.301 --> 00:01:51.580
<v Speaker 1>I've really experienced that reading the Tao Te Ching,</v>

40
00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.080
<v Speaker 1>which is document I would really like to do a lecture on at some point because</v>

41
00:01:56.081 --> 00:01:57.490
<v Speaker 1>some of the verses I don't understand,</v>

42
00:01:57.491 --> 00:01:59.650
<v Speaker 1>but others stand right out and I can understand them.</v>

43
00:01:59.651 --> 00:02:02.440
<v Speaker 1>And I think I understood what this part of the story of Noah meant.</v>

44
00:02:02.441 --> 00:02:03.940
<v Speaker 1>And I think it means,</v>

45
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:04.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

46
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.230
<v Speaker 1>we talked a little bit about what nakedness meant in the story of Adam and eve.</v>

47
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.560
<v Speaker 1>And the idea essentially was that to know yourself naked is to become aware of</v>

48
00:02:14.291 --> 00:02:15.370
<v Speaker 1>your vulnerability,</v>

49
00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:16.810
<v Speaker 1>the physical,</v>

50
00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.800
<v Speaker 1>your physical boundaries in time and space and your,</v>

51
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:21.813
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

52
00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.070
<v Speaker 1>your physiological,</v>

53
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.960
<v Speaker 1>your fundamental physiological insufficiencies as they meet might be judged by</v>

54
00:02:28.961 --> 00:02:29.320
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>

55
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.860
<v Speaker 1>So there's biological insufficiency that sort of built into you because you're a</v>

56
00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:33.880
<v Speaker 1>fragile mortal,</v>

57
00:02:33.881 --> 00:02:36.160
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable half insane creature.</v>

58
00:02:36.161 --> 00:02:36.771
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

59
00:02:36.771 --> 00:02:38.800
<v Speaker 1>that's just an existential truth.</v>

60
00:02:38.801 --> 00:02:39.634
<v Speaker 1>And then of course,</v>

61
00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.090
<v Speaker 1>even merely as a human being,</v>

62
00:02:43.091 --> 00:02:44.230
<v Speaker 1>even with all those faults,</v>

63
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.520
<v Speaker 1>there are faults that you have that are particular to you that might be judged</v>

64
00:02:48.521 --> 00:02:50.200
<v Speaker 1>harshly by the group while might be,</v>

65
00:02:50.201 --> 00:02:52.900
<v Speaker 1>we'll definitely be judged harshly by the group.</v>

66
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.280
<v Speaker 1>And so to become aware of your nakedness is to become self conscious and to,</v>

67
00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.730
<v Speaker 1>and to,</v>

68
00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.680
<v Speaker 1>to know your limits and to know vulnerability.</v>

69
00:02:59.681 --> 00:03:04.681
<v Speaker 1>And that's what is revealed to him when he comes across as farther naked.</v>

70
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:11.230
<v Speaker 1>It's so the question is what does it mean to see your father naked?</v>

71
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.030
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to me,</v>

72
00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:15.280
<v Speaker 1>and especially in an inappropriate manner like this,</v>

73
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.480
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

74
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.110
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

75
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.943
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

76
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.470
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

77
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.950
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

78
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.290
<v Speaker 1>it's as if ham,</v>

79
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.780
<v Speaker 1>he does the same thing that happens in the Mesopotamian creation myth.</v>

80
00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.360
<v Speaker 1>When when tie him out an absolute give rise to the first God's there,</v>

81
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.190
<v Speaker 1>they're the father of the eventual day of redemption.</v>

82
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.490
<v Speaker 1>Marduk they're very careless and noisy and the kill appsu their father and</v>

83
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.690
<v Speaker 1>attempt to inhabit his corpse.</v>

84
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.780
<v Speaker 1>And that makes timeout enraged.</v>

85
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.970
<v Speaker 1>And so she bursts forth from the darkness to,</v>

86
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.111
<v Speaker 1>to do the men.</v>

87
00:03:50.111 --> 00:03:54.070
<v Speaker 1>It's like a precursor to the flood story or an analog to the flood story.</v>

88
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.970
<v Speaker 1>And I see the same thing happening here with him is that he's,</v>

89
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.970
<v Speaker 1>he's insufficiently respectful of his father.</v>

90
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.360
<v Speaker 1>And the question is exactly what does the farther represent.</v>

91
00:04:04.361 --> 00:04:04.841
<v Speaker 1>And you could say,</v>

92
00:04:04.841 --> 00:04:05.021
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

93
00:04:05.021 --> 00:04:05.590
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

94
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:06.423
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

95
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.670
<v Speaker 1>there's the father that you have and that's a human being.</v>

96
00:04:09.671 --> 00:04:09.931
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

97
00:04:09.931 --> 00:04:11.140
<v Speaker 1>that's a man like other men,</v>

98
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:12.340
<v Speaker 1>a man among men.</v>

99
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.230
<v Speaker 1>But then there's the farther as such.</v>

100
00:04:14.231 --> 00:04:15.820
<v Speaker 1>And that's the spirit of the father.</v>

101
00:04:15.821 --> 00:04:18.250
<v Speaker 1>And insofar as you have a father,</v>

102
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.840
<v Speaker 1>you have both at the same time.</v>

103
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.840
<v Speaker 1>You have the personal father that's a man among other men just like anyone else</v>

104
00:04:25.521 --> 00:04:25.991
<v Speaker 1>who's father.</v>

105
00:04:25.991 --> 00:04:28.900
<v Speaker 1>But insofar as that man is your father,</v>

106
00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:31.600
<v Speaker 1>that means that he's something different than just another person.</v>

107
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.910
<v Speaker 1>And what he is is the incarnation of the spirit of the father.</v>

108
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.310
<v Speaker 1>And to see that,</v>

109
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.780
<v Speaker 1>to take it to what,</v>

110
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.360
<v Speaker 1>to disrespect that carelessly,</v>

111
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:44.680
<v Speaker 1>maybe even he like,</v>

112
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:45.041
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

113
00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:45.821
<v Speaker 1>it makes a mistake,</v>

114
00:04:45.821 --> 00:04:46.070
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

115
00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.903
<v Speaker 1>He</v>

116
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.840
<v Speaker 1>produces wine and gets himself drunk.</v>

117
00:04:49.841 --> 00:04:50.561
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>

118
00:04:50.561 --> 00:04:50.980
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

119
00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:51.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

120
00:04:51.251 --> 00:04:53.830
<v Speaker 1>if he's sprawled out there for everyone to see,</v>

121
00:04:53.831 --> 00:04:55.990
<v Speaker 1>it's hardly hams fault if he stumbles across him.</v>

122
00:04:55.991 --> 00:05:00.991
<v Speaker 1>But the book is laying out a danger and the danger is that,</v>

123
00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.430
<v Speaker 1>well maybe you catch your father at his most vulnerable moment and if you're</v>

124
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:11.670
<v Speaker 1>disrespectful then you transgress against the spirit of the father.</v>

125
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.520
<v Speaker 1>And if you transgress against the spirit of farther and Louis Spirit of the</v>

126
00:05:15.521 --> 00:05:18.100
<v Speaker 1>father and lose respect for the spirit of the father,</v>

127
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.450
<v Speaker 1>then that is likely to transform you into a slave.</v>

128
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.620
<v Speaker 1>That's a very interesting idea and I think it's particularly interesting.</v>

129
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.480
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not particularly interesting,</v>

130
00:05:28.481 --> 00:05:29.500
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

131
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.240
<v Speaker 1>it's particularly Germane,</v>

132
00:05:31.241 --> 00:05:31.631
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

133
00:05:31.631 --> 00:05:36.631
<v Speaker 1>to our current cultural situation because I think that we're pushed constantly</v>

134
00:05:37.211 --> 00:05:38.950
<v Speaker 1>to see the nakedness of our father,</v>

135
00:05:38.951 --> 00:05:39.784
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

136
00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:46.020
<v Speaker 1>because of the intense criticism that's directed towards our culture and the</v>

137
00:05:47.591 --> 00:05:48.640
<v Speaker 1>patriarchal culture,</v>

138
00:05:48.641 --> 00:05:49.474
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

139
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.710
<v Speaker 1>We're constantly exposing its weaknesses and vulnerabilities and let's say</v>

140
00:05:53.711 --> 00:05:54.544
<v Speaker 1>nakedness,</v>

141
00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:55.683
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

142
00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.080
<v Speaker 1>there's wrong with criticism,</v>

143
00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.070
<v Speaker 1>but the thing about criticism is the purpose of criticism is to separate the</v>

144
00:06:02.071 --> 00:06:03.090
<v Speaker 1>wheat from the chaff.</v>

145
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.430
<v Speaker 1>It's not the burn everything to the ground,</v>

146
00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:06.181
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

147
00:06:06.181 --> 00:06:06.691
<v Speaker 1>It's to say,</v>

148
00:06:06.691 --> 00:06:07.524
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

149
00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.360
<v Speaker 1>we're going to carefully look at this.</v>

150
00:06:09.361 --> 00:06:10.740
<v Speaker 1>We're going to carefully differentiate.</v>

151
00:06:10.741 --> 00:06:13.560
<v Speaker 1>We're going to keep what's good and we're going to move away from what's bad,</v>

152
00:06:13.561 --> 00:06:17.400
<v Speaker 1>but the point of the criticism isn't to identify everything is bad.</v>

153
00:06:17.401 --> 00:06:18.930
<v Speaker 1>It's two separate.</v>

154
00:06:18.931 --> 00:06:23.100
<v Speaker 1>What's good from what's bad so that you can retain what's good and move towards</v>

155
00:06:23.101 --> 00:06:23.934
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

156
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:29.260
<v Speaker 1>and to be careless at that is is deadly because you're inhabited by the spirit</v>

157
00:06:29.521 --> 00:06:30.240
<v Speaker 1>of the father,</v>

158
00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:30.451
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

159
00:06:30.451 --> 00:06:32.790
<v Speaker 1>In so far as you're a cultural construction,</v>

160
00:06:32.791 --> 00:06:34.170
<v Speaker 1>which of course is something that the,</v>

161
00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:35.790
<v Speaker 1>that the postmodern,</v>

162
00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:38.940
<v Speaker 1>Neo Marxists are absolutely enthusiastic about.</v>

163
00:06:38.941 --> 00:06:42.450
<v Speaker 1>You're a cultural construction in so far as you're a cultural construction,</v>

164
00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.700
<v Speaker 1>then your inhabited by the spirit of the father.</v>

165
00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:49.700
<v Speaker 1>And to be disrespectful towards that means to undermine the very structure that</v>

166
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.500
<v Speaker 1>makes you not all of what you are.</v>

167
00:06:52.501 --> 00:06:54.630
<v Speaker 1>Certainly certainly not all of what you are,</v>

168
00:06:54.631 --> 00:06:56.820
<v Speaker 1>but a good portion of what you are in,</v>

169
00:06:56.821 --> 00:06:59.670
<v Speaker 1>in so far as you're a socialized cultural entity.</v>

170
00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:01.740
<v Speaker 1>And if you pull out the,</v>

171
00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.040
<v Speaker 1>if you pull the foundation out from underneath that,</v>

172
00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.090
<v Speaker 1>what do you have left it,</v>

173
00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:08.760
<v Speaker 1>you can hardly manage on your own.</v>

174
00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:09.840
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

175
00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.100
<v Speaker 1>it's just not possible.</v>

176
00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.380
<v Speaker 1>You're a cultural creation.</v>

177
00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:19.280
<v Speaker 1>And so Hamm makes this desperate error and is careless about exposing himself to</v>

178
00:07:22.651 --> 00:07:24.840
<v Speaker 1>the vulnerability of his father or something like that.</v>

179
00:07:24.841 --> 00:07:26.610
<v Speaker 1>He does it without sufficient respect.</v>

180
00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.690
<v Speaker 1>And the judgment is that not only will he be asleep,</v>

181
00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:35.340
<v Speaker 1>but so all of his descendants and he's contracted with the other two sons who</v>

182
00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.810
<v Speaker 1>I suppose are willing to give their father the benefit of the doubt,</v>

183
00:07:39.811 --> 00:07:40.740
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

184
00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:43.620
<v Speaker 1>And so when they see him in a compromising position,</v>

185
00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.470
<v Speaker 1>they handle it with respect and,</v>

186
00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:47.603
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

187
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:49.800
<v Speaker 1>and don't capitalize on it.</v>

188
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:50.810
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

189
00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:52.500
<v Speaker 1>and maybe that makes them strong.</v>

190
00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.210
<v Speaker 1>That's what it seems to me.</v>

191
00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.910
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that's what that story means.</v>

192
00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:01.560
<v Speaker 1>It has something to do with respect.</v>

193
00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:03.091
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

194
00:08:03.091 --> 00:08:06.090
<v Speaker 1>And the funny thing about having respect for your culture,</v>

195
00:08:06.091 --> 00:08:08.430
<v Speaker 1>and I suppose that's partly why I'm doing the biblical stories,</v>

196
00:08:08.431 --> 00:08:10.150
<v Speaker 1>is because they're part of,</v>

197
00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:11.610
<v Speaker 1>they're part of my culture.</v>

198
00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:14.310
<v Speaker 1>They're part of our culture perhaps.</v>

199
00:08:14.311 --> 00:08:19.110
<v Speaker 1>But there they're certainly part of my culture and it seems to me that</v>

200
00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:24.620
<v Speaker 1>it's worthwhile to treat that with respect to see what you can glean from it</v>

201
00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.353
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

202
00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:28.370
<v Speaker 1>and not kick it when it's down,</v>

203
00:08:28.371 --> 00:08:29.204
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

204
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:31.183
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

205
00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:40.010
<v Speaker 1>And so that's how the story of no ends,</v>

206
00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:40.311
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

207
00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:45.311
<v Speaker 1>And the thing too is Noah is actually a pretty decent incarnation of the spirit</v>

208
00:08:46.941 --> 00:08:47.511
<v Speaker 1>of the father.</v>

209
00:08:47.511 --> 00:08:47.930
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

210
00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:52.930
<v Speaker 1>which I suppose is one of the things that makes Hams misstep more egregious is</v>

211
00:08:54.261 --> 00:08:54.920
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

212
00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:55.171
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

213
00:08:55.171 --> 00:08:57.690
<v Speaker 1>Noah just built an ark and got everybody through the flood.</v>

214
00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.081
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

215
00:08:58.081 --> 00:08:58.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

216
00:08:58.650 --> 00:08:59.710
<v Speaker 1>it's not so bad in.</v>

217
00:08:59.711 --> 00:09:04.440
<v Speaker 1>So maybe the fact that he happened to drink too much wine one day wasn't enough</v>

218
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.480
<v Speaker 1>to justify humiliating him.</v>

219
00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:08.483
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

220
00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:13.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's pushing the limits of symbolic interpretation to note on a</v>

221
00:09:13.351 --> 00:09:15.900
<v Speaker 1>daily basis that were all contained in an arc.</v>

222
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:16.951
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

223
00:09:16.951 --> 00:09:20.340
<v Speaker 1>And that's the arc that you could think about that as the arc that's been</v>

224
00:09:20.341 --> 00:09:22.320
<v Speaker 1>bequeathed to us by our forefathers.</v>

225
00:09:22.321 --> 00:09:26.130
<v Speaker 1>That's the tremendous infrastructure that we inhabit,</v>

226
00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:31.500
<v Speaker 1>that we take for granted because it works so well that protects us from things</v>

227
00:09:31.501 --> 00:09:33.210
<v Speaker 1>that we can't even imagine.</v>

228
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:35.790
<v Speaker 1>And we don't have to imagine because we're so well protected.</v>

229
00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:39.270
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that's really struck me hard,</v>

230
00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:44.400
<v Speaker 1>I would say about the disintegration and corruption of the universities is the</v>

231
00:09:44.401 --> 00:09:46.690
<v Speaker 1>absolute in gratitude that goes along with that.</v>

232
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:49.231
<v Speaker 1>Criticism,</v>

233
00:09:49.231 --> 00:09:49.741
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

234
00:09:49.741 --> 00:09:50.700
<v Speaker 1>is for fine thing,</v>

235
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:54.330
<v Speaker 1>if it's done in the spirit in a proper spirit,</v>

236
00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.060
<v Speaker 1>and that's the spirit of separating the wheat from the chaff.</v>

237
00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:59.400
<v Speaker 1>But it needs to be accompanied by gratitude.</v>

238
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:03.960
<v Speaker 1>And it does seem to me that anyone who lives in the west,</v>

239
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:06.840
<v Speaker 1>in the western culture at this time,</v>

240
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:12.800
<v Speaker 1>in history and in this place and who isn't simultaneously grateful for that is,</v>

241
00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:15.200
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

242
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:19.830
<v Speaker 1>is half blind at least because it's never been better than this.</v>

243
00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:24.750
<v Speaker 1>And it could be so much worse and it's highly likely that it will be so much</v>

244
00:10:24.751 --> 00:10:26.970
<v Speaker 1>worse because for most of human history,</v>

245
00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.430
<v Speaker 1>so much worse is the norm.</v>
