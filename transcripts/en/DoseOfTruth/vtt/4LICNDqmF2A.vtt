1
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.230
<v Speaker 1>Success breeds success and failure</v>
<v Speaker 1>breeds failure.</v>

2
00:00:10.231 --> 00:00:14.280
<v Speaker 1>And it's not necessarily linear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a really difficult thing to</v>

3
00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:18.630
<v Speaker 1>deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's hard on societies because one</v>

4
00:00:18.631 --> 00:00:21.840
<v Speaker 1>of the things we do know is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.260
<v Speaker 1>as you stretch out the inequality you</v>
<v Speaker 1>make men particularly on the lower end</v>

6
00:00:28.351 --> 00:00:31.920
<v Speaker 1>of the distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more and more likely to be aggressive.</v>

7
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.680
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine every man has a threshold for</v>

8
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.340
<v Speaker 1>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

9
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.230
<v Speaker 1>and status is important to men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knocked that it's not important to</v>

10
00:00:40.231 --> 00:00:42.240
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's different.</v>

11
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.990
<v Speaker 1>It's a different kind of status.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's status is important to men because</v>

12
00:00:45.991 --> 00:00:49.870
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the things that makes them</v>
<v Speaker 1>marketable as partners to women.</v>

13
00:00:49.871 --> 00:00:52.170
<v Speaker 1>So it actually turns out to be quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>important to man them.</v>

14
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.890
<v Speaker 1>Men tend to compete with one another for</v>
<v Speaker 1>status,</v>

15
00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.180
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy position and in a really</v>
<v Speaker 1>unequal society.</v>

16
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.720
<v Speaker 1>If you're like a low rung guy then and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have any opportunity to rise</v>

17
00:01:06.451 --> 00:01:11.100
<v Speaker 1>because the society isn't structured so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's mobility,</v>

18
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.490
<v Speaker 1>then the more aggressive guys tend to</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn into criminality and you know,</v>

19
00:01:17.371 --> 00:01:22.371
<v Speaker 1>and so you could say there's a threshold</v>
<v Speaker 1>for criminality and the more inequality</v>

20
00:01:23.101 --> 00:01:28.101
<v Speaker 1>pressure you put on a particular area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>geographic or political area,</v>

21
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.870
<v Speaker 1>the more inequality pressure you put on</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

22
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.120
<v Speaker 1>the more men slip past that threshold</v>
<v Speaker 1>and into criminality.</v>

23
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.610
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been pretty good studies done of</v>

24
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.940
<v Speaker 1>drug gang in Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the best one.</v>

25
00:01:42.941 --> 00:01:45.780
<v Speaker 1>It's sociologist actually went and hung</v>
<v Speaker 1>out with a drug gang for,</v>

26
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.140
<v Speaker 1>he got into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess the drug gang leader was,</v>

27
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say necessarily narcissistic,</v>

28
00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:57.060
<v Speaker 1>but that might be a reasonable way of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it.</v>

29
00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.690
<v Speaker 1>And he was kind of happy with the idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>of maybe being a subject of a book and,</v>

30
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.910
<v Speaker 1>and so this guy was able to associate</v>
<v Speaker 1>with them,</v>

31
00:02:08.911 --> 00:02:12.750
<v Speaker 1>got to know them quite well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the housing project in which</v>

32
00:02:12.751 --> 00:02:16.380
<v Speaker 1>the gang was housed was slated for</v>
<v Speaker 1>demolition.</v>

33
00:02:16.381 --> 00:02:21.150
<v Speaker 1>And the gang broke up and he got the</v>
<v Speaker 1>books because they kept books.</v>

34
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.360
<v Speaker 1>And what he found was the average street</v>
<v Speaker 1>drug dealer,</v>

35
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.390
<v Speaker 1>first of all was employed in another job</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well and was making far less than</v>

36
00:02:30.691 --> 00:02:33.840
<v Speaker 1>minimum wage now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the guy is,</v>

37
00:02:33.841 --> 00:02:37.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>further up the chain of course followed</v>

38
00:02:37.051 --> 00:02:39.810
<v Speaker 1>the Prieto distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there was a tiny minority of them</v>

39
00:02:39.811 --> 00:02:41.790
<v Speaker 1>who were raking in a tremendous amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>of loot.</v>

40
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.350
<v Speaker 1>And the guys at the bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just waiting around for the</v>

41
00:02:46.351 --> 00:02:49.800
<v Speaker 1>possibility that they could rise up the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy and you know,</v>

42
00:02:49.801 --> 00:02:53.580
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty violent game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the chances that someone is going to</v>

43
00:02:53.581 --> 00:02:58.350
<v Speaker 1>be</v>
<v Speaker 1>taken out is pretty high and then a</v>

44
00:02:58.351 --> 00:03:03.351
<v Speaker 1>little slot up for some opportunistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>second rater and perhaps he can move up</v>

45
00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:05.734
<v Speaker 1>the hierarchy.</v>

46
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:10.653
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

47
00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.660
<v Speaker 1>So the burrito distribution governs all</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of other things too.</v>

48
00:03:14.661 --> 00:03:19.190
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned</v>
<v Speaker 1>it governs the popularity of box,</v>

49
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.530
<v Speaker 1>the sales of books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also,</v>

50
00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.010
<v Speaker 1>it also characterizes the distribution</v>
<v Speaker 1>of everything that people produce.</v>

51
00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.900
<v Speaker 1>So if you think of creative production</v>
<v Speaker 1>of any sort of artistic production,</v>

52
00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.180
<v Speaker 1>industrial production,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>

53
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.540
<v Speaker 1>Almost everything fails.</v>

54
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

55
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.480
<v Speaker 1>And a few things succeed beyond anyone's</v>
<v Speaker 1>wildest imagination.</v>

56
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.850
<v Speaker 1>Apple's a good example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

57
00:03:47.851 --> 00:03:51.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean the iPhone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have their competitors,</v>

58
00:03:51.361 --> 00:03:55.860
<v Speaker 1>but it's an extraordinarily dominant</v>
<v Speaker 1>product and they rake in billions of</v>

59
00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:56.693
<v Speaker 1>dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

60
00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if apple is valued at $1</v>
<v Speaker 1>trillion,</v>

61
00:03:59.581 --> 00:04:03.750
<v Speaker 1>but it's close to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a lot of money.</v>

62
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.380
<v Speaker 1>And I think if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something like this,</v>

63
00:04:07.381 --> 00:04:10.290
<v Speaker 1>I probably have the figures wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like the top 40 people,</v>

64
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.950
<v Speaker 1>the richest 40 people in the world have</v>
<v Speaker 1>as much money as the bottom 2 billion</v>

65
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.960
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

66
00:04:15.961 --> 00:04:19.530
<v Speaker 1>it's not like they're stuffing their</v>
<v Speaker 1>mattresses with that money or they have</v>

67
00:04:19.531 --> 00:04:24.531
<v Speaker 1>a skyscraper full of cash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That money is out in the economy doing</v>

68
00:04:24.601 --> 00:04:28.200
<v Speaker 1>whatever money does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

69
00:04:28.201 --> 00:04:31.890
<v Speaker 1>you can't spend $28 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

70
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.870
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes you can even do some good</v>
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>

71
00:04:33.871 --> 00:04:36.960
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Gates seems to be doing something</v>

72
00:04:36.961 --> 00:04:40.350
<v Speaker 1>reasonable with his money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the reason I'm telling you this is</v>

73
00:04:40.351 --> 00:04:45.351
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things you should</v>
<v Speaker 1>know is that this proclivity for</v>

74
00:04:45.931 --> 00:04:50.931
<v Speaker 1>inequality is pervasive among the</v>
<v Speaker 1>creative products of human beings.</v>

75
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.690
<v Speaker 1>It's the case with with goals scored in</v>
<v Speaker 1>hockey.</v>

76
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.200
<v Speaker 1>My son told me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's a reliable source on hockey</v>

77
00:04:58.201 --> 00:04:59.160
<v Speaker 1>statistics that,</v>

78
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.770
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

79
00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.200
<v Speaker 1>if Wayne Gretzky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't count any of the points</v>

80
00:05:03.201 --> 00:05:08.201
<v Speaker 1>that Wayne Gretzky managed with scoring</v>
<v Speaker 1>is still had enough points just with</v>

81
00:05:08.361 --> 00:05:11.480
<v Speaker 1>assistance to have more points than any</v>
<v Speaker 1>hockey player that ever played.</v>

82
00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.760
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you even at the upper end of of of the</v>

83
00:05:16.761 --> 00:05:20.130
<v Speaker 1>distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some person who's ha there are</v>

84
00:05:20.131 --> 00:05:23.900
<v Speaker 1>so good at what they do and then there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>another person that's so much better</v>

85
00:05:23.901 --> 00:05:27.470
<v Speaker 1>than them that it's not even comparable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

86
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.440
<v Speaker 1>and the benefits flow to people who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that position.</v>

87
00:05:31.441 --> 00:05:33.290
<v Speaker 1>And you can understand why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

88
00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.190
<v Speaker 1>because I all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you start writing and you get</v>

89
00:05:37.191 --> 00:05:42.150
<v Speaker 1>a book and a rare things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rare things to have happen.</v>

90
00:05:42.151 --> 00:05:43.790
<v Speaker 1>And then some people read it and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it.</v>

91
00:05:43.791 --> 00:05:46.760
<v Speaker 1>And then of course it's much more likely</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you'll get a next book.</v>

92
00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.760
<v Speaker 1>And if people like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while it's even more likely that you'll</v>

93
00:05:49.761 --> 00:05:53.060
<v Speaker 1>get a third book and then people start</v>
<v Speaker 1>to know who you are and then because</v>

94
00:05:53.061 --> 00:05:55.040
<v Speaker 1>they know who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they phone you up on offer you</v>

95
00:05:55.041 --> 00:05:56.900
<v Speaker 1>opportunities and your network grows.</v>

96
00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.900
<v Speaker 1>And it's like this exponential increase</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your reach and your capacity for</v>

97
00:06:03.111 --> 00:06:06.560
<v Speaker 1>production and more and more flows to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

98
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.920
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then on the other hand,</v>

99
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.300
<v Speaker 1>if you start to fail and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would someone fail?</v>

100
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:15.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

101
00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one idea that's very common in our</v>

102
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.070
<v Speaker 1>culture is that poverty is caused by</v>
<v Speaker 1>lack of money.</v>

103
00:06:22.071 --> 00:06:27.071
<v Speaker 1>And that's a really stupid idea because</v>
<v Speaker 1>money is very difficult to handle.</v>

104
00:06:27.081 --> 00:06:32.081
<v Speaker 1>I have clients who were drug addicts and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the worst possible thing that could</v>

105
00:06:32.571 --> 00:06:34.460
<v Speaker 1>happen to them was that they got some</v>
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

106
00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:36.800
<v Speaker 1>but they're just done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

107
00:06:36.801 --> 00:06:39.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were hanging around with people who</v>

108
00:06:39.051 --> 00:06:42.530
<v Speaker 1>were little on the sociopathic side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

109
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.730
<v Speaker 1>especially if they weren't that bright</v>
<v Speaker 1>and couldn't defend themselves very</v>

110
00:06:46.731 --> 00:06:49.310
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as they got money while it was</v>

111
00:06:49.311 --> 00:06:52.130
<v Speaker 1>off to the bar with all the friends and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

112
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:55.130
<v Speaker 1>one guy I remember in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

113
00:06:55.131 --> 00:06:58.940
<v Speaker 1>every time he got his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his disability check,</v>

114
00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:02.750
<v Speaker 1>he was gone for five days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually found him in a ditch.</v>

115
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:05.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause he just go to the bar,</v>

116
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:10.930
<v Speaker 1>spent every sandy had on alcohol and</v>
<v Speaker 1>cocaine and wake up in a ditch,</v>

117
00:07:12.381 --> 00:07:14.120
<v Speaker 1>three quarters dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

118
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:18.100
<v Speaker 1>eventually completely dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

119
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:23.230
<v Speaker 1>then he was ashamed and horrified and</v>
<v Speaker 1>repentant and he'd straightened himself</v>

120
00:07:24.381 --> 00:07:26.540
<v Speaker 1>out again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that was all well and good</v>

121
00:07:26.541 --> 00:07:29.900
<v Speaker 1>until,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as he was broke until the next</v>

122
00:07:29.901 --> 00:07:31.940
<v Speaker 1>check showed up and then bang the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

123
00:07:31.941 --> 00:07:32.930
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

124
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:37.580
<v Speaker 1>it's not like money is necessarily a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good for everyone.</v>

125
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:40.640
<v Speaker 1>It's hard manage money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really easy for it to disappear.</v>

126
00:07:40.641 --> 00:07:42.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>elderly people have a hell of a time now</v>

127
00:07:42.831 --> 00:07:46.040
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crooks are contacting them all on the</v>

128
00:07:46.041 --> 00:07:50.210
<v Speaker 1>Internet nonstop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so just giving people money,</v>

129
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:53.720
<v Speaker 1>money's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like pouring water in their hands</v>

130
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:56.540
<v Speaker 1>is not that helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not necessarily that helpful.</v>

131
00:07:56.541 --> 00:07:59.870
<v Speaker 1>And then of course contributors to</v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty are,</v>

132
00:07:59.871 --> 00:08:01.940
<v Speaker 1>well it's not so good to have a low Iq.</v>

133
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:06.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't like the idea of Iq because</v>

134
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:10.010
<v Speaker 1>it seems so arbitrary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you have a high Iq.</v>

135
00:08:10.011 --> 00:08:12.470
<v Speaker 1>Well it's not like you deserve that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

136
00:08:12.471 --> 00:08:15.560
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you set up that way pretty much right</v>

137
00:08:15.561 --> 00:08:16.880
<v Speaker 1>from the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

138
00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:18.020
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

139
00:08:18.021 --> 00:08:21.770
<v Speaker 1>very stable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can make a high Iq person stupider</v>

140
00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.620
<v Speaker 1>by you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not educating them up to the level of</v>

141
00:08:24.621 --> 00:08:28.850
<v Speaker 1>their possibility but taking someone who</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a low Iq and trying to raise that.</v>

142
00:08:28.851 --> 00:08:30.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you can figure out how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that,</v>

143
00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:36.160
<v Speaker 1>well you know it's Nobel prize time for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you because people have tried that a lot</v>

144
00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:40.040
<v Speaker 1>and most recently with those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know Luminol Lumosity games and that</v>

145
00:08:40.041 --> 00:08:42.560
<v Speaker 1>sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the evidence that those produce</v>

146
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:48.700
<v Speaker 1>anything other than brilliant</v>
<v Speaker 1>performances on the Lumosity game itself</v>

147
00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.460
<v Speaker 1>is basically zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We haven't been able to figure out how</v>

148
00:08:52.461 --> 00:08:57.461
<v Speaker 1>to see cause I intelligence a cross</v>
<v Speaker 1>domain phenomena and you can get really</v>

149
00:08:58.591 --> 00:09:02.910
<v Speaker 1>good in a single domain by practicing</v>
<v Speaker 1>like mad and what you'd want is to</v>

150
00:09:02.911 --> 00:09:06.570
<v Speaker 1>practice like mad in a single domain and</v>
<v Speaker 1>hope that it generalize to other</v>

151
00:09:06.571 --> 00:09:09.630
<v Speaker 1>domains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the holy grail of intelligence</v>

152
00:09:09.631 --> 00:09:10.560
<v Speaker 1>increase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

153
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.140
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one's done it.</v>

154
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:16.380
<v Speaker 1>People claim it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the claims never hold up and people</v>

155
00:09:16.381 --> 00:09:20.460
<v Speaker 1>have been trying for a long time to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and they haven't been able to do it.</v>

156
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:21.563
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

157
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.290
<v Speaker 1>differences in Iq really make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>

158
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.870
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you guys,</v>

159
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:35.930
<v Speaker 1>average Iq is probably one 25 one 30</v>
<v Speaker 1>at one 15 you're at the 85th percentile</v>

160
00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:43.130
<v Speaker 1>and one 15 would barely get you going</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

161
00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:48.490
<v Speaker 1>for Harvard University one 30 you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably graduate school and material,</v>

162
00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:54.410
<v Speaker 1>you know one 45 you're up there</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the range where you can probably do</v>

163
00:09:55.921 --> 00:09:58.650
<v Speaker 1>pretty much whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although as you get smarter,</v>

164
00:09:58.651 --> 00:10:01.160
<v Speaker 1>the scatter between your abilities</v>
<v Speaker 1>increase it.</v>

165
00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:04.860
<v Speaker 1>So you might have a very high verbal Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not be so good at mathematics or the</v>

166
00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:08.010
<v Speaker 1>other way around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's a massive contributor to</v>

167
00:10:08.011 --> 00:10:13.011
<v Speaker 1>lifetime success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know what to do about that.</v>

168
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:16.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do smart people make more money?</v>

169
00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:21.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get to where the edge of production</v>

170
00:10:21.691 --> 00:10:25.380
<v Speaker 1>is faster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you have a thousand people and you</v>

171
00:10:25.381 --> 00:10:27.810
<v Speaker 1>rank order them by Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the smart people are going to come up</v>

172
00:10:27.811 --> 00:10:31.840
<v Speaker 1>with a new ideas first and they're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have more ideas and they're going to</v>

173
00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:35.370
<v Speaker 1>strategize better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

174
00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:40.490
<v Speaker 1>with an Iq of 90 which is</v>
<v Speaker 1>15% of the population,</v>

175
00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.390
<v Speaker 1>you think about that 15% of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>

176
00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:50.190
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty much the threshold for</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading instructions and being able to</v>

177
00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:50.700
<v Speaker 1>follow them.</v>
