<v Speaker 1>you can hear me.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Let me turn off.</v>

8
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.480
<v Speaker 1>Turn on music.</v>

9
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:53.443
<v Speaker 1>All Right,</v>

<v Speaker 1>nice.</v>

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.333
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

12
00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Speaker 1>What I was trying to do</v>

13
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.023
<v Speaker 2>is</v>

14
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.810
<v Speaker 2>instead of using the laptop</v>

15
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.820
<v Speaker 2>video source was trying to hook up my dslr camera</v>

16
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.270
<v Speaker 2>is a canon add.</v>

17
00:03:13.271 --> 00:03:13.511
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

18
00:03:13.511 --> 00:03:15.520
<v Speaker 2>And I have that one of those Yeti mic hooked up.</v>

19
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.880
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>

20
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:19.713
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>

21
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.120
<v Speaker 2>So I know you guys have probably seen it.</v>

22
00:03:24.121 --> 00:03:26.400
<v Speaker 2>There's a whole lot of people that post,</v>

23
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

24
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:27.960
<v Speaker 2>Jordan Peterson stuff.</v>

25
00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.293
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

26
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.270
<v Speaker 2>the only reason I stopped is because in September,</v>

27
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.713
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

28
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.120
<v Speaker 2>I think it was mid September,</v>

29
00:03:36.121 --> 00:03:40.830
<v Speaker 2>I received a message from youtube saying that my channel was going to be</v>

30
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.440
<v Speaker 2>demonetized a produce allocation.</v>

31
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.150
<v Speaker 2>There were other channels that got demonetized to like voltaire.</v>

32
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.090
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

33
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.731
<v Speaker 2>I'm drawing a blank,</v>

34
00:03:54.731 --> 00:03:57.520
<v Speaker 2>but there were a few of the channels that would cut clips.</v>

35
00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:00.253
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

36
00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.640
<v Speaker 2>I was kind of surprised that it happened.</v>

37
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.183
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

38
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.290
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

39
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.123
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

40
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.003
<v Speaker 2>that's what happens.</v>

41
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.833
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

42
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.980
<v Speaker 2>so I'm not really sure what to do now.</v>

43
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:16.713
<v Speaker 2>I didn't stop.</v>

44
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.320
<v Speaker 2>I didn't stop posting Jordan's content because anything with the cabinet thing</v>

45
00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:23.693
<v Speaker 2>seat,</v>

46
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.790
<v Speaker 2>the most amazing thing to me because I've listened to,</v>

47
00:04:27.791 --> 00:04:29.280
<v Speaker 2>not all of his university lectures,</v>

48
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.580
<v Speaker 2>but all the Bible lectures,</v>

49
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.150
<v Speaker 2>probably each one at least two or three times,</v>

50
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.800
<v Speaker 2>not because I want to listen to it,</v>

51
00:04:35.801 --> 00:04:36.220
<v Speaker 2>to her.</v>

52
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.750
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

53
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:37.300
<v Speaker 2>I liked,</v>

54
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.280
<v Speaker 2>I liked listening to them,</v>

55
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.440
<v Speaker 2>but the whole thing was,</v>

56
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:44.800
<v Speaker 2>the idea was I was editing,</v>

57
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.770
<v Speaker 2>so I was listening to segments over and over.</v>

58
00:04:47.771 --> 00:04:49.020
<v Speaker 2>And as soon as I read the cabin,</v>

59
00:04:49.021 --> 00:04:50.650
<v Speaker 2>I think I thought to myself,</v>

60
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.071
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

61
00:04:51.071 --> 00:04:51.840
<v Speaker 2>I know what he's,</v>

62
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.541
<v Speaker 2>what he's getting at.</v>

63
00:04:52.541 --> 00:04:53.140
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

64
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.760
<v Speaker 2>even though he didn't explain it to later,</v>

65
00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:55.060
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

66
00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.980
<v Speaker 2>I instantly knew probably be because,</v>

67
00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.971
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

68
00:04:57.971 --> 00:05:02.260
<v Speaker 2>if all the stuff he says on youtube is any indication of his personality,</v>

69
00:05:02.261 --> 00:05:05.140
<v Speaker 2>which you would imagine it would be.</v>

70
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:06.423
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

71
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.290
<v Speaker 2>the idea was that,</v>

72
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:09.703
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

73
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.923
<v Speaker 2>maybe we should,</v>

74
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.771
<v Speaker 2>maybe Kevin,</v>

75
00:05:11.771 --> 00:05:16.570
<v Speaker 2>how should back off and let there be peace rather than</v>

76
00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:20.840
<v Speaker 2>rather than,</v>

77
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.093
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

78
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.010
<v Speaker 2>so much turmoil.</v>

79
00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.731
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

80
00:05:26.731 --> 00:05:27.240
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>

81
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't really care.</v>

82
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:33.890
<v Speaker 2>I consider most of what's in what you see on the mainstream news to be.</v>

83
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:38.673
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

84
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:40.240
<v Speaker 2>basically the,</v>

85
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.660
<v Speaker 2>the pr arm for the state,</v>

86
00:05:42.661 --> 00:05:46.380
<v Speaker 2>that's what I consider politics basically the public relations arm for the</v>

87
00:05:46.381 --> 00:05:47.214
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>

88
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:48.323
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

89
00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.360
<v Speaker 2>So it doesn't matter.</v>

90
00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.830
<v Speaker 2>Kevin gets elected Kevin and doesn't get elected.</v>

91
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.000
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter.</v>

92
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.170
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

93
00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.280
<v Speaker 2>Kevin was definitely a status as much,</v>

94
00:05:58.281 --> 00:06:00.860
<v Speaker 2>as much as he could be one,</v>

95
00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:04.683
<v Speaker 5>but.</v>

96
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.961
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

97
00:06:05.961 --> 00:06:06.710
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

98
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.570
<v Speaker 2>but there is one thing that I,</v>

99
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:13.690
<v Speaker 2>that I came across recently and that was a Peterson's.</v>

100
00:06:14.661 --> 00:06:15.494
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking,</v>

101
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:21.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking how to thank you.</v>

102
00:06:21.201 --> 00:06:22.034
<v Speaker 2>You need help here.</v>

103
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:24.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what that means,</v>

104
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.510
<v Speaker 2>what kind of help do I need?</v>

105
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.893
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

106
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:31.063
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

107
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:35.960
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

108
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:36.860
<v Speaker 2>but the odd thing that,</v>

109
00:06:36.861 --> 00:06:41.861
<v Speaker 2>that Peterson had tweeted out was the whole Holocaust denier being synonymous</v>

110
00:06:46.611 --> 00:06:47.780
<v Speaker 2>with climate change.</v>

111
00:06:47.781 --> 00:06:48.830
<v Speaker 2>Denial is that,</v>

112
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:50.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I'm getting it right.</v>

113
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.130
<v Speaker 2>You guys remember that tweet.</v>

114
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:53.593
<v Speaker 2>I don't fall,</v>

115
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:55.063
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

116
00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.590
<v Speaker 2>Jordan Peterson's twitter that often.</v>

117
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.760
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

118
00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:03.760
<v Speaker 2>but I've tried to get in contact with a publicist to ask for permission to.</v>

119
00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:11.410
<v Speaker 2>We broadcast this stuff so I could forward an email to youtube and hopefully get</v>

120
00:07:11.411 --> 00:07:12.340
<v Speaker 2>re monetized.</v>

121
00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:17.510
<v Speaker 5>I don't know that that's going to happen,</v>

122
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:18.883
<v Speaker 5>but.</v>

123
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:21.470
<v Speaker 5>So yeah.</v>

124
00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:24.710
<v Speaker 1>Mm,</v>

125
00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:26.693
<v Speaker 1>mm</v>

126
00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:31.793
<v Speaker 1>mm.</v>

127
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:33.201
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

128
00:07:33.201 --> 00:07:35.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't have anything with Peterson today.</v>

129
00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:50.630
<v Speaker 2>Penguins are upside down.</v>

130
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.033
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

131
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:52.933
<v Speaker 2>Well</v>

132
00:07:58.820 --> 00:07:59.720
<v Speaker 2>that's fine with me.</v>

133
00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:07.051
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

134
00:08:07.051 --> 00:08:07.920
<v Speaker 2>it should be clear.</v>

135
00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:11.940
<v Speaker 2>Is it looking like it's pretty clear.</v>

136
00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.580
<v Speaker 2>I think that if I had a.</v>

137
00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.090
<v Speaker 2>How about I pay pal you?</v>

138
00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:23.241
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

139
00:08:23.241 --> 00:08:27.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I can turn on super chat because I'm no longer a part of the</v>

140
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:29.630
<v Speaker 2>youtube part or program.</v>

141
00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:32.493
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

142
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.141
<v Speaker 2>well that's good.</v>

143
00:08:39.141 --> 00:08:42.440
<v Speaker 2>I think the video would probably be even clear if I had a,</v>

144
00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:43.283
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

145
00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:46.240
<v Speaker 2>a lens with a lower stop.</v>

146
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.550
<v Speaker 2>You can start posting about your own ideas since he might've taken some</v>

147
00:08:52.551 --> 00:08:53.510
<v Speaker 2>influence from Latinos.</v>

148
00:08:53.511 --> 00:08:54.344
<v Speaker 2>Peterson lectures.</v>

149
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:55.883
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

150
00:08:58.650 --> 00:08:59.610
<v Speaker 2>funny enough.</v>

151
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:03.413
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

152
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:04.340
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

153
00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:05.130
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

154
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:07.320
<v Speaker 2>I've thought quite a bit more.</v>

155
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:09.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of looking at streaming options here.</v>

156
00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:11.893
<v Speaker 5>Do</v>

157
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:19.650
<v Speaker 5>you have a son?</v>

158
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:30.610
<v Speaker 2>I go into the CEO Volusia Pako</v>

159
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:37.070
<v Speaker 2>was Spanish and I don't know that song.</v>

160
00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:40.103
<v Speaker 2>What's the topic?</v>

161
00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:41.640
<v Speaker 2>Or May I suggest one?</v>

162
00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:42.803
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

163
00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:43.561
<v Speaker 2>Your own ideas.</v>

164
00:09:43.561 --> 00:09:44.394
<v Speaker 2>Give us some.</v>

165
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:45.360
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

166
00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

167
00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:48.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that I'm,</v>

168
00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:56.250
<v Speaker 2>well I'm still kind of trying to learn a little bit more about history.</v>

169
00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:57.600
<v Speaker 2>Like for instance,</v>

170
00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:58.020

176
00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:14.390
<v Speaker 2>One of the more interesting books is a book of his called a war force that gives</v>

177
00:10:17.401 --> 00:10:18.234
<v Speaker 2>us meaning</v>

178

<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

179

<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:28.720
<v Speaker 2>I start to want to read the chat.</v>

183
00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:30.170
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

184
00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:32.050
<v Speaker 2>Chris Hedges book is basically about,</v>

185
00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:33.183
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

186
00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:34.420
<v Speaker 2>I haven't,</v>

187
00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:35.253
<v Speaker 2>I haven't read it.</v>

188
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:36.241
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

189
00:10:36.241 --> 00:10:36.520
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

190
00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.353
<v Speaker 2>I've got hedge,</v>

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:39.230
<v Speaker 2>his newest book America,</v>

192
00:10:39.231 --> 00:10:39.850
<v Speaker 2>the fell,</v>

193
00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:40.510
<v Speaker 2>fell,</v>

194
00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:43.000
<v Speaker 2>fell where the farewell tour,</v>

195
00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:43.751
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

196
00:10:43.751 --> 00:10:45.550
<v Speaker 2>it's a bit dyslexic but not his,</v>

197
00:10:45.551 --> 00:10:46.384
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

198
00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:48.040
<v Speaker 2>as far as I know his first book,</v>

199
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:50.500
<v Speaker 2>a force to gives us meaning,</v>

200
00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:51.670
<v Speaker 2>but it's about basically,</v>

201
00:10:51.671 --> 00:10:52.504
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

202
00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:53.980
<v Speaker 2>that soldiers,</v>

203
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:55.710
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

204
00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:56.830
<v Speaker 2>people in combat,</v>

205
00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.060
<v Speaker 2>you don't have a lot to relate to a,</v>

206
00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:01.870
<v Speaker 2>especially when they start,</v>

207
00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:02.733
<v Speaker 2>when they make,</v>

208
00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:04.240
<v Speaker 2>when they make contact.</v>

209
00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:06.603
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

210
00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:08.111
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

211
00:11:08.111 --> 00:11:10.630
<v Speaker 2>they develop this,</v>

212
00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:19.330
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

213
00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:19.490
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

214
00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:23.140
<v Speaker 2>it just gives soldiers meaning combat gives soldiers meaning and when they come</v>

215
00:11:23.141 --> 00:11:28.141
<v Speaker 2>home it becomes a whole lot more difficult to assimilate to something that</v>

216
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:32.290
<v Speaker 2>doesn't recognize combat at all.</v>

217
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.581
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

218
00:11:33.581 --> 00:11:34.150
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

219
00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:34.690
<v Speaker 2>but I was,</v>

220
00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:35.523
<v Speaker 2>someone asked me,</v>

221
00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:35.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

222
00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:36.910
<v Speaker 2>some of your own ideas.</v>

223
00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:37.480
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

224
00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.520
<v Speaker 2>I've recently found out that,</v>

225
00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.553
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

226
00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:42.670
<v Speaker 2>some of the</v>

227
00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:45.820
<v Speaker 2>people that brought us,</v>

228
00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:48.790
<v Speaker 2>if you're an employee in the United States</v>

229
00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:51.820
<v Speaker 2>in the early,</v>

230
00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:53.020
<v Speaker 2>early 20th century,</v>

231
00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.880
<v Speaker 2>the early 20th century</v>

232
00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.220
<v Speaker 2>workers had a lot to be</v>

233
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:03.310
<v Speaker 2>upset about.</v>

234
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:04.840
<v Speaker 2>Their living conditions were bad.</v>

235
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:10.200
<v Speaker 2>They worked a tremendous amount of hours for little pay for as far as I know,</v>

236
00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:16.720
<v Speaker 2>next to no ability to advance at all in society.</v>

237
00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:19.300
<v Speaker 2>That's the majority,</v>

238
00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:20.530
<v Speaker 2>not just a generalization,</v>

239
00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:26.130
<v Speaker 2>so no workers started to strike and a lot of,</v>

240
00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:28.810
<v Speaker 2>not a lot of,</v>

241
00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.040
<v Speaker 2>but an organization,</v>

242
00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:31.750
<v Speaker 2>the industrial workers of the world,</v>

243
00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:35.980
<v Speaker 2>which was a socialist organization which had both socialists and communists in</v>

244
00:12:35.981 --> 00:12:36.814
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

245
00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:38.993
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

246
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:42.980
<v Speaker 2>advocated on behalf of American workers to strike.</v>

247
00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:44.270
<v Speaker 2>And from what I've read,</v>

248
00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.410
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

249
00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:45.950
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

250
00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:46.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

251
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:49.490
<v Speaker 2>the beginning of the strikes,</v>

252
00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:55.190
<v Speaker 2>the beginning of the strikes were a</v>

253
00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:57.530
<v Speaker 2>peaceful,</v>

254
00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:58.363
<v Speaker 2>nonviolent,</v>

255
00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.440
<v Speaker 2>and the state,</v>

256
00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:02.401
<v Speaker 2>not just the state,</v>

257
00:13:02.401 --> 00:13:02.630
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

258
00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:03.860
<v Speaker 2>not the state that first.</v>

259
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:06.350
<v Speaker 2>But first corporations were,</v>

260
00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:07.923
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

261
00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:13.540
<v Speaker 2>became very apprehensive to the idea of strike from what I've read.</v>

262
00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:19.360
<v Speaker 2>And so they started to hire a militias in local organizations to try and police</v>

263
00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:25.490
<v Speaker 2>and intimidate,</v>

264
00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:31.630
<v Speaker 2>and I use violence against the peaceful protests to the point where when the</v>

265
00:13:35.601 --> 00:13:37.490
<v Speaker 2>protests became so out of hand,</v>

266
00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:38.750
<v Speaker 2>the companies would,</v>

267
00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:40.200
<v Speaker 2>would petition the state,</v>

268
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:41.960
<v Speaker 2>the state would petition the federal government,</v>

269
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:44.120
<v Speaker 2>and then they would bring in the military,</v>

270
00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:45.593
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

271
00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.540
<v Speaker 2>to put down strikes.</v>

272
00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:48.580
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

273
00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:48.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

274
00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:49.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

275
00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:51.853
<v Speaker 2>I'm not that,</v>

276
00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.153
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

277
00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:56.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that much about history,</v>

278
00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:56.931
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

279
00:13:56.931 --> 00:13:57.081
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

280
00:13:57.081 --> 00:14:00.080
<v Speaker 2>I try and look at parallels that are happening.</v>

281
00:14:00.081 --> 00:14:00.710
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

282
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:00.981
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

283
00:14:00.981 --> 00:14:02.130
<v Speaker 2>one thing that I saw you,</v>

284
00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:04.783
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

285
00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.790
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

286
00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.240
<v Speaker 2>one thing that I saw was around the same time,</v>

287
00:14:15.241 --> 00:14:15.511
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

288
00:14:15.511 --> 00:14:16.344
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

289
00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:18.180
<v Speaker 2>revolutions in Russia we're going on.</v>

290
00:14:18.181 --> 00:14:18.840
<v Speaker 2>So maybe the,</v>

291
00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:19.673
<v Speaker 2>maybe the state</v>

292
00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:25.180
<v Speaker 2>basic to understanding history,</v>

293
00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:26.920
<v Speaker 2>understanding human nature,</v>

294
00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:28.703
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

295
00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:32.443
<v Speaker 4>but the,</v>

296
00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:43.060
<v Speaker 2>so maybe the state thought that what was happening in eastern Europe was going</v>

297
00:14:43.671 --> 00:14:45.980
<v Speaker 2>to happen in the United States.</v>

298
00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:47.120
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

299
00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:49.400
<v Speaker 2>so I could see why there would,</v>

300
00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:50.900
<v Speaker 2>there there were legitimate.</v>

301
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:55.430
<v Speaker 2>Although I don't think that that's really,</v>

302
00:14:58.720 --> 00:14:59.740
<v Speaker 2>that's the truth.</v>

303
00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:02.230
<v Speaker 2>That's just one possibility.</v>

304
00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:04.163
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

305
00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:11.540
<v Speaker 2>so I find it very interesting that socialists and communists are the ones that</v>

306
00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:17.730
<v Speaker 2>advocate it and eventually got to giving,</v>

307
00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:19.123
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

308
00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:22.280
<v Speaker 2>the better living standard of the</v>

309
00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:24.920
<v Speaker 2>American employee.</v>

310
00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:27.070
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

311
00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:27.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

312
00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:28.430
<v Speaker 2>if you're self employed,</v>

313
00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:29.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

314
00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:30.830
<v Speaker 2>you don't follow the same guidelines.</v>

315
00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:33.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm lucky now because I'm self employed.</v>

316
00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:37.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm a cabinet installer,</v>

317
00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:41.200
<v Speaker 2>matures carpenter,</v>

318
00:15:41.201 --> 00:15:44.980
<v Speaker 2>but much better and finished carpentry then rough carpentry.</v>

319
00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:46.143
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

320
00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:48.940
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not an employee so,</v>

321
00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:49.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

322
00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:49.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

323
00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:52.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm lucky a lot of ways and you know,</v>

324
00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.540
<v Speaker 2>people I've left comments and comment sections.</v>

325
00:15:55.541 --> 00:15:56.530
<v Speaker 2>This guy is boring.</v>

326
00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:00.753
<v Speaker 2>Nice,</v>

327
00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:01.803
<v Speaker 2>low key.</v>

328
00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:06.490
<v Speaker 4>Well I'm,</v>

329
00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:14.100
<v Speaker 2>I forgot I was going to say,</v>

330
00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:18.180
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

331
00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:19.050
<v Speaker 2>people have said to me,</v>

332
00:16:19.051 --> 00:16:19.231
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

333
00:16:19.231 --> 00:16:20.340
<v Speaker 2>what if I don't want to work?</v>

334
00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:21.773
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

335
00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:24.540
<v Speaker 2>all those socialist movements,</v>

336
00:16:24.541 --> 00:16:25.680
<v Speaker 2>the communist movements,</v>

337
00:16:25.681 --> 00:16:30.681
<v Speaker 2>the strikes basically gave you the American worker like an eight hour working</v>

338
00:16:31.621 --> 00:16:32.070
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>

339
00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:33.010
<v Speaker 2>weekends,</v>

340
00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:33.993
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

341
00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.670
<v Speaker 2>a better standard of living.</v>

342
00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.260
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

343
00:16:37.261 --> 00:16:41.270
<v Speaker 2>where that contrasts with Peterson's idea that you know,</v>

344
00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.113
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't,</v>

345
00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:44.420
<v Speaker 2>it's not a good idea to,</v>

346
00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:50.640
<v Speaker 2>to place a group above you,</v>

347
00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:51.691
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

348
00:16:51.691 --> 00:16:52.740
<v Speaker 2>if I'm saying it correctly,</v>

349
00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:52.891
<v Speaker 2>will,</v>

350
00:16:52.891 --> 00:16:54.270
<v Speaker 2>the idea is that they're not,</v>

351
00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:55.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

352
00:16:55.230 --> 00:17:00.060
<v Speaker 2>these people are not only advocating for everyone for a better living standard</v>

353
00:17:00.061 --> 00:17:00.990
<v Speaker 2>for everybody else,</v>

354
00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:03.120
<v Speaker 2>but also for themselves.</v>

355
00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.040
<v Speaker 2>So a,</v>

356
00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:09.120
<v Speaker 2>and people have tried to rebut the idea of,</v>

357
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:09.511
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

358
00:17:09.511 --> 00:17:11.160
<v Speaker 2>what if I don't want to work eight hours,</v>

359
00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:12.263
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

360
00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:15.300
<v Speaker 2>what if I want to work 12 hours or 14 hours?</v>

361
00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:16.320
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

362
00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:17.040
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

363
00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.340
<v Speaker 2>but what if you weren't making even minimum wage?</v>

364
00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:21.300
<v Speaker 2>What if you were making</v>

365
00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:23.913
<v Speaker 2>a dollar,</v>

366
00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:25.920
<v Speaker 2>$2 to $3 an hour?</v>

367
00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:27.253
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

368
00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:28.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

369
00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:32.840
<v Speaker 2>working a 16 hour days for $3 an hour would be a,</v>

370
00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.830
<v Speaker 2>would be really rough.</v>

371
00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:39.150
<v Speaker 2>And something that I've recently learned about,</v>

372
00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:40.393
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

373
00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:45.080
<v Speaker 2>in the libertarian camp was a little big on me.</v>

374
00:17:45.081 --> 00:17:50.081
<v Speaker 2>So this was actually advocating for workers across the world so that trade could</v>

375
00:17:55.681 --> 00:17:57.030
<v Speaker 2>flow freely.</v>

376
00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:59.100
<v Speaker 2>That worker is,</v>

377
00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:00.991
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

378
00:18:00.991 --> 00:18:03.030
<v Speaker 2>across the world would be paid the same,</v>

379
00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:06.330
<v Speaker 2>so the migrant workers would be paid well.</v>

380
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:11.070
<v Speaker 2>So what that would do was basically reduced the American living standard and</v>

381
00:18:11.071 --> 00:18:12.870
<v Speaker 2>European living standard down to that,</v>

382
00:18:12.871 --> 00:18:13.621
<v Speaker 2>of the migrants,</v>

383
00:18:13.621 --> 00:18:17.370
<v Speaker 2>which at that time I think we're Chinese and black workers.</v>

384
00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:18.540
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

385
00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:21.510
<v Speaker 2>so a lot of people don't know that about me,</v>

386
00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:22.010
<v Speaker 2>sis.</v>

387
00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:22.843
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

388
00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:23.471
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

389
00:18:23.471 --> 00:18:24.304
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

390
00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:26.173
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

391
00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:29.700
<v Speaker 2>it just doesn't sound like a very good idea that,</v>

392
00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:34.760
<v Speaker 2>that means that you and probably all 33 people watching right now wouldn't ever</v>

393
00:18:36.961 --> 00:18:39.270
<v Speaker 2>have been able to get out of</v>

394
00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:43.470
<v Speaker 2>what would be far below poverty in the,</v>

395
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:44.670
<v Speaker 2>in the West now.</v>

396
00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:46.693
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

397
00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:49.733
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

398
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:51.301
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

399
00:18:51.301 --> 00:18:52.134
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

400
00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:55.320
<v Speaker 2>it's just weird that that's kind of stamped,</v>

401
00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:59.100
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of stamped out of history in a lot of people don't know that.</v>

402
00:18:59.101 --> 00:18:59.840
<v Speaker 2>I certainly did.</v>

403
00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:00.080
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

404
00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.430
<v Speaker 4>that I'm,</v>

405
00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:04.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

406
00:19:04.511 --> 00:19:05.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm definitely</v>

407
00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:10.450
<v Speaker 2>don't have any type of ideology,</v>

408
00:19:10.451 --> 00:19:11.980
<v Speaker 2>I believe that will fix anything.</v>

409
00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:17.370
<v Speaker 2>I personally like a Karl Popper's idea of open society.</v>

410
00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:20.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know that much about Karl Popper,</v>

411
00:19:20.921 --> 00:19:21.671
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

412
00:19:21.671 --> 00:19:21.851
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

413
00:19:21.851 --> 00:19:26.851
<v Speaker 2>the concept of open society is that in order to,</v>

414
00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:28.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

415
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
<v Speaker 2>it's not George Soros Open society though he may have grabbed ideas from it for</v>

416
00:19:36.221 --> 00:19:37.270
<v Speaker 2>his organization,</v>

417
00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:42.330
<v Speaker 2>Karl Popper philosophers idea of an open society was that,</v>

418
00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:52.400
<v Speaker 2>that everything is in flux and ideas are dynamic and times change and that you</v>

419
00:19:52.401 --> 00:19:57.401
<v Speaker 2>constantly have to figure out what's going to work and if that means</v>

420
00:19:57.801 --> 00:19:59.000
<v Speaker 2>experimenting with,</v>

421
00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:00.363
<v Speaker 2>with different</v>

422
00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:04.190
<v Speaker 2>social ideas or</v>

423
00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:11.120
<v Speaker 2>it's just the idea that there's never any one set of ideas.</v>

424
00:20:11.991 --> 00:20:13.250
<v Speaker 2>Nothing's ever final.</v>

425
00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:15.710
<v Speaker 2>Everything has to be under constant scrutiny,</v>

426
00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:16.520
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

427
00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:16.791
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

428
00:20:16.791 --> 00:20:19.130
<v Speaker 2>if you extrapolate that out to the individual,</v>

429
00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:20.233
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

430
00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:23.810
<v Speaker 2>if you are constantly policing,</v>

431
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:25.130
<v Speaker 2>policing is a good word.</v>

432
00:20:25.131 --> 00:20:26.750
<v Speaker 2>But being mindful of yourself,</v>

433
00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:29.003
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

434
00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:30.223
<v Speaker 5>then</v>

435
00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:34.740
<v Speaker 2>and taking action to do what's best for you,</v>

436
00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:36.530
<v Speaker 2>then you know,</v>

437
00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:37.643
<v Speaker 2>you'll probably</v>

438
00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:39.451
<v Speaker 2>come out.</v>

439
00:20:39.451 --> 00:20:40.284
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

440
00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:43.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that the future is going to be.</v>

441
00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:51.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that Americans,</v>

442
00:20:51.091 --> 00:20:52.000
<v Speaker 2>especially in the future,</v>

443
00:20:52.001 --> 00:20:56.100
<v Speaker 2>are going to survive in the exact same system that they have now.</v>

444
00:20:57.010 --> 00:20:57.843
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

445
00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:04.100
<v Speaker 2>basically the whole idea of profit being the bottom line.</v>

446
00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:07.831
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

447
00:21:07.831 --> 00:21:08.664
<v Speaker 2>you hear people</v>

448
00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:11.950
<v Speaker 2>every once in awhile I'll,</v>

449
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.070
<v Speaker 2>I'll see something on Fox News and</v>

450
00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:18.973
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

451
00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:24.730
<v Speaker 2>and there was a segment,</v>

452
00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:30.030
<v Speaker 2>I think it was on Fox business news and this guy was saying,</v>

453
00:21:30.431 --> 00:21:30.551
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

454
00:21:30.551 --> 00:21:32.410
<v Speaker 2>how do you know what,</v>

455
00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:37.150
<v Speaker 2>what arguments do you use against people who claim that socialism the answer?</v>

456
00:21:37.151 --> 00:21:37.601
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

457
00:21:37.601 --> 00:21:37.721
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

458
00:21:37.721 --> 00:21:38.740
<v Speaker 2>just look at the Internet.</v>

459
00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:40.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

460
00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:40.421
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

461
00:21:40.421 --> 00:21:41.440
<v Speaker 2>that's another thing that you,</v>

462
00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:46.600
<v Speaker 2>you have to know something about and you know,</v>

463
00:21:46.601 --> 00:21:47.530
<v Speaker 2>whereas,</v>

464
00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:49.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

465
00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:52.960
<v Speaker 2>Ebay was the perfect example of a free market to begin with.</v>

466
00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:55.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that it's still like that.</v>

467
00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:58.150
<v Speaker 2>Free markets existed on the Internet,</v>

468
00:21:58.151 --> 00:22:02.950
<v Speaker 2>but the Internet itself is the product of a socialist institution,</v>

469
00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:04.960
<v Speaker 2>a centralized institution.</v>

470
00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:08.500
<v Speaker 2>The United States military and the Department of Defense,</v>

471
00:22:08.501 --> 00:22:09.520
<v Speaker 2>Advanced Research,</v>

472
00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:10.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

473
00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:10.621
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

474
00:22:10.621 --> 00:22:12.910
<v Speaker 2>it was arpanet before it became the Internet.</v>

475
00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:14.373
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

476
00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:16.780
<v Speaker 2>so no socialism gave you the Internet,</v>

477
00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:17.710
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

478
00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:18.543
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

479
00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:23.260
<v Speaker 2>tax dollars gave you,</v>

480
00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:24.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

481
00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:25.640
<v Speaker 2>what we enjoy today.</v>

482
00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:27.123
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

483
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:30.080
<v Speaker 2>and something that I've,</v>

484
00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:32.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that much about.</v>

485
00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:32.740
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

486
00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:33.573
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

487
00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.100
<v Speaker 2>as far as I know,</v>

488
00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:38.800
<v Speaker 2>Marxism is a critique,</v>

489
00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:39.941
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

490
00:22:39.941 --> 00:22:42.250
<v Speaker 2>it's like saying that,</v>

491
00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:43.113
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

492
00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:46.090
<v Speaker 2>I guess I'm trying to say that</v>

493
00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:49.060
<v Speaker 2>Marxism didn't kill</v>

494
00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:52.650
<v Speaker 2>however many people in,</v>

495
00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:54.883
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

496
00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:55.620
<v Speaker 2>in Europe.</v>

497
00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:56.070
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

498
00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:56.903
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

499
00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:59.910
<v Speaker 2>Stalin was in eastern Europe.</v>

500
00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:01.770
<v Speaker 2>Stalin was basically a thug.</v>

501
00:23:01.771 --> 00:23:05.880
<v Speaker 2>He was a lot like the United States organized criminals,</v>

502
00:23:05.881 --> 00:23:06.091
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

503
00:23:06.091 --> 00:23:06.810
<v Speaker 2>he was just a,</v>

504
00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:10.890
<v Speaker 2>he was basically just a gangster who rose to the head of the state.</v>

505
00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:14.430
<v Speaker 2>But Marxism is a critique of,</v>

506
00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:15.623
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

507
00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:21.380
<v Speaker 2>financial institutions or I get.</v>

508
00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:21.701
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>

509
00:23:21.701 --> 00:23:22.660
<v Speaker 2>economics.</v>

510
00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:23.610
<v Speaker 2>Marxism is,</v>

511
00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:24.970
<v Speaker 2>is a critique of economics.</v>

512
00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:26.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that much about Marxism,</v>

513
00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:28.540
<v Speaker 2>but like I said,</v>

514
00:23:28.541 --> 00:23:32.480
<v Speaker 2>the idea would be that Marxism didn't kill 'em.</v>

515
00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:37.920
<v Speaker 2>However many people that would be like saying that Algebra killed the people in</v>

516
00:23:39.011 --> 00:23:40.540
<v Speaker 2>Nagasaki and Hiroshima,</v>

517
00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:40.841
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

518
00:23:40.841 --> 00:23:41.674
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

519
00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:43.690
<v Speaker 2>you can't make that distinction,</v>

520
00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:45.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

521
00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:49.730
<v Speaker 2>as much as Peterson says that Marxism is a,</v>

522
00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:53.730
<v Speaker 2>it's a philosophy of resentment.</v>

523
00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:54.593
<v Speaker 2>That may be true,</v>

524
00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:55.081
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

525
00:23:55.081 --> 00:23:57.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that much about marks.</v>

526
00:23:58.230 --> 00:23:58.560
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

527
00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:03.060
<v Speaker 2>one thing that I've heard from people who have read mark's more that's</v>

528
00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:08.150
<v Speaker 2>interesting is that mark spoke out against a financial speculation.</v>

529
00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:10.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

530
00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:15.710
<v Speaker 2>much of what gave you much of what gives a Western societies the bubbles that</v>

531
00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:19.673
<v Speaker 2>are created,</v>

532
00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:22.260
<v Speaker 2>the housing bubble,</v>

533
00:24:22.261 --> 00:24:22.531
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

534
00:24:22.531 --> 00:24:23.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

535
00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:24.450
<v Speaker 2>securities bubble,</v>

536
00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:28.200
<v Speaker 2>the bubble that we have now that's,</v>

537
00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:29.903
<v Speaker 2>that's bursting.</v>

538
00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:33.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm not only is it bad for,</v>

539
00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:35.100
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

540
00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:37.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why it would be bad for people on the way up,</v>

541
00:24:37.501 --> 00:24:39.450
<v Speaker 2>but on the way down when the bubble bursts,</v>

542
00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:41.333
<v Speaker 2>you have the,</v>

543
00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:42.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

544
00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:44.250
<v Speaker 2>finance financial institutions,</v>

545
00:24:44.251 --> 00:24:47.340
<v Speaker 2>the banks that just go ahead and buy up all the assets of the people that can no</v>

546
00:24:47.341 --> 00:24:48.540
<v Speaker 2>longer afford things.</v>

547
00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:50.963
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

548
00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:52.613
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

549
00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:52.861
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

550
00:24:52.861 --> 00:24:53.031
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

551
00:24:53.031 --> 00:24:57.090
<v Speaker 2>it would seem that mark's had some good ideas though.</v>

552
00:24:57.091 --> 00:24:58.110
<v Speaker 2>His character,</v>

553
00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:03.090
<v Speaker 2>the character of his person wasn't</v>

554
00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:05.560
<v Speaker 2>an marble,</v>

555
00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:06.450
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

556
00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:06.661
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

557
00:25:06.661 --> 00:25:08.220
<v Speaker 2>maybe some of his ideas,</v>

558
00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:13.250
<v Speaker 2>maybe some ideas of Marxism are worth noting.</v>

559
00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:16.283
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

560
00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:18.151
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

561
00:25:18.151 --> 00:25:22.650
<v Speaker 2>obviously private property seems like a pretty good thing to me.</v>

562
00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:24.203
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

563
00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:25.381
<v Speaker 2>but like I said,</v>

564
00:25:25.381 --> 00:25:29.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm much more towards Karl Popper's idea of an open society.</v>

565
00:25:29.431 --> 00:25:31.620
<v Speaker 2>So it shouldn't just be,</v>

566
00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:33.363
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

567
00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:34.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

568
00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:36.660
<v Speaker 2>straight capitalism or straight socialism,</v>

569
00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:37.441
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

570
00:25:37.441 --> 00:25:38.910
<v Speaker 2>it should be basically,</v>

571
00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:42.840
<v Speaker 2>there should be little experiments in the economy.</v>

572
00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:44.310
<v Speaker 2>A company's,</v>

573
00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:47.351
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

574
00:25:47.351 --> 00:25:47.981
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>

575
00:25:47.981 --> 00:25:48.280
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

576
00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:53.280
<v Speaker 2>as far as I know in Germany for corporations that have over a thousand for</v>

577
00:25:55.901 --> 00:25:58.540
<v Speaker 2>corporations that have over a thousand or so people</v>

578
00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:07.590
<v Speaker 2>for corporations and what the hell is up in this chat for corporations that have</v>

579
00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:09.450
<v Speaker 2>more than a thousand or so people.</v>

580
00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:14.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm the executives are actually voted on by the workers.</v>

581
00:26:14.851 --> 00:26:16.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's true.</v>

582
00:26:16.051 --> 00:26:18.410
<v Speaker 2>I've heard that a,</v>

583
00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:19.530
<v Speaker 2>if that is true,</v>

584
00:26:19.531 --> 00:26:19.831
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

585
00:26:19.831 --> 00:26:20.664
<v Speaker 2>that's</v>

586
00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:22.023
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

587
00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:25.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean these are just little things that,</v>

588
00:26:25.381 --> 00:26:26.214
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

589
00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:27.780
<v Speaker 2>why isn't,</v>

590
00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:29.550
<v Speaker 2>why isn't anything?</v>

591
00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:31.230
<v Speaker 2>Why doesn't anything ever change?</v>

592
00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:31.531
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

593
00:26:31.531 --> 00:26:32.364
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

594
00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:32.671
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

595
00:26:32.671 --> 00:26:37.260
<v Speaker 2>there's always unintended consequences and you go ahead and you solve one</v>

596
00:26:37.261 --> 00:26:39.840
<v Speaker 2>problem and you create a whole bunch of others,</v>

597
00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:43.800
<v Speaker 2>which is true.</v>

598
00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:45.950
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

599
00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:47.840
<v Speaker 2>but there's no,</v>

600
00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:52.570
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't seem like there's enough innovation and economics.</v>

601
00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:53.813
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

602
00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:56.870
<v Speaker 2>not that I know that much,</v>

603
00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:00.830
<v Speaker 2>but it seems like we're reaching a pretty bad</v>

604
00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:04.273
<v Speaker 2>time now.</v>

605
00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:08.150
<v Speaker 2>And there's other one point of contention they have with Peterson,</v>

606
00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:08.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

607
00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:09.320
<v Speaker 2>where is he says,</v>

608
00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:10.131
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

609
00:27:10.131 --> 00:27:11.330
<v Speaker 2>people in the West</v>

610
00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:14.730
<v Speaker 5>are the,</v>

611
00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:18.780
<v Speaker 2>the people who are the poorest are still among the one percent of the world.</v>

612
00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:20.183
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

613
00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:21.173
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

614
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:22.590
<v Speaker 2>I kinda like to</v>

615
00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:25.291
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

616
00:27:25.291 --> 00:27:25.831
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

617
00:27:25.831 --> 00:27:27.540
<v Speaker 2>always know if it's appropriate.</v>

618
00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:34.100
<v Speaker 2>Basically go from micro to macro and by that I mean that maybe we shouldn't</v>

619
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:41.520
<v Speaker 2>judge the western countries shouldn't judge themselves based on,</v>

620
00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:43.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

621
00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:44.280
<v Speaker 2>the other countries of the world.</v>

622
00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:47.790
<v Speaker 2>We shouldn't judge ourselves based on poor countries,</v>

623
00:27:47.791 --> 00:27:50.610
<v Speaker 2>but by where we were at,</v>

624
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:53.670
<v Speaker 2>where we are at,</v>

625
00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:55.710
<v Speaker 2>I think that if we,</v>

626
00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:57.211
<v Speaker 2>we did that,</v>

627
00:27:57.211 --> 00:27:57.391
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

628
00:27:57.391 --> 00:27:58.224
<v Speaker 2>maybe we would,</v>

629
00:27:58.270 --> 00:27:59.103
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

630
00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:02.431
<v Speaker 2>move forward.</v>

631
00:28:02.431 --> 00:28:03.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the hell that means.</v>

632
00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:05.423
<v Speaker 2>I mean if I was,</v>

633
00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:05.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

634
00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:06.780
<v Speaker 2>an executive,</v>

635
00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:10.320
<v Speaker 2>a making a whole lot of money,</v>

636
00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:13.080
<v Speaker 2>it would basically just be the status quo for me.</v>

637
00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:17.040
<v Speaker 2>So I can understand why things don't change or they change very slowly.</v>

638
00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:20.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm just kinda rambling.</v>

639
00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:25.130
<v Speaker 2>What are your thoughts on the reason behind almost everyone in the photo is her.</v>

640
00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:26.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anything about that.</v>

641
00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:35.730
<v Speaker 2>You guys have any questions?</v>

642
00:28:36.790 --> 00:28:38.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I can answer anything.</v>

643
00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:48.760
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

644
00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:56.153
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

645
00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:57.663
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>

646
00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:00.450
<v Speaker 2>Ideas I have are still being formulated,</v>

647
00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:01.313
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

648
00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:05.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's ever a good idea to just write off</v>

649
00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:10.340
<v Speaker 2>right off all that's something.</v>

650
00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:11.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean financial speculation,</v>

651
00:29:11.931 --> 00:29:12.764
<v Speaker 2>gambling,</v>

652
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:13.641
<v Speaker 2>financial,</v>

653
00:29:13.641 --> 00:29:14.430
<v Speaker 2>gambling use.</v>

654
00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:17.480
<v Speaker 2>It used to be illegal and now it's not,</v>

655
00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:19.600
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

656
00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:21.111
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

657
00:29:21.111 --> 00:29:24.470
<v Speaker 2>the idea that speculation is a good thing because,</v>

658
00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:24.861
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

659
00:29:24.861 --> 00:29:28.700
<v Speaker 2>speculation can be a good thing because then it allows banks to lend more money</v>

660
00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:30.950
<v Speaker 2>so an economy can be more productive.</v>

661
00:29:30.951 --> 00:29:34.070
<v Speaker 2>I've read that in some article that was probably,</v>

662
00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:35.813
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

663
00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:41.560
<v Speaker 2>some bank funded article or somebody that paying</v>

664
00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:45.370
<v Speaker 6>for those views to be me put out,</v>

665
00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:47.453
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

666
00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:48.221
<v Speaker 6>But you know,</v>

667
00:29:48.221 --> 00:29:50.050
<v Speaker 6>Karl Popper's open society,</v>

668
00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:54.340
<v Speaker 6>the philosopher Karl Popper and the idea of open society now.</v>

669
00:29:54.341 --> 00:29:56.060
<v Speaker 6>That's not as far as I know,</v>

670
00:29:56.061 --> 00:29:57.370
<v Speaker 6>that's not open borders.</v>

671
00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:58.353
<v Speaker 6>That's not,</v>

672
00:29:58.680 --> 00:29:59.080
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

673
00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:02.340
<v Speaker 6>what all migrants in that's</v>

674
00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:07.240
<v Speaker 6>more of a way I think to organize,</v>

675
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:09.400
<v Speaker 6>organize a state.</v>

676
00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:11.553
<v Speaker 1>Mm.</v>

677
00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:15.243
<v Speaker 1>Mm.</v>

678
00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.910
<v Speaker 6>I'm not really too concerned with</v>

679
00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:29.650
<v Speaker 6>the Jews so much.</v>

680
00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:32.680
<v Speaker 6>Don't really understand why.</v>

681
00:30:32.681 --> 00:30:34.600
<v Speaker 6>That's why is that such a big thing in the</v>

682
00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:43.013
<v Speaker 1>hmm?</v>

683
00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:44.450
<v Speaker 1>Mm,</v>

684
00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:47.180
<v Speaker 1>mm,</v>

685
00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:50.180
<v Speaker 1>mm,</v>

686
00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:52.170
<v Speaker 1>mm,</v>

687
00:30:57.630 --> 00:31:00.080
<v Speaker 1>mm,</v>

<v Speaker 1>mm,</v>

689
00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.030
<v Speaker 1>mm,</v>

690

<v Speaker 1>mm,</v>

693
00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:29.553
<v Speaker 1>mm,</v>

694
00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:30.403
<v Speaker 1>mm,</v>

695
00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:31.353
<v Speaker 1>mm,</v>

696
00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:33.460
<v Speaker 1>mm,</v>

697
00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:36.643
<v Speaker 1>mm,</v>

698
00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:38.853
<v Speaker 1>mm.</v>

699
00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:46.570
<v Speaker 6>As little Sunday night rather than a few days ago.</v>

700
00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:49.360
<v Speaker 6>Just simple stupid shit.</v>

701
00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:54.830
<v Speaker 1>Mm MM.</v>

702
00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:16.230
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

703
00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:18.210
<v Speaker 6>There was a comment that was held for review.</v>

704
00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:20.280
<v Speaker 6>It's interesting.</v>

705
00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:21.540
<v Speaker 6>I don't understand why that's.</v>

706
00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:30.440
<v Speaker 6>I don't pay a whole lot of attention to,</v>

707
00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:34.933
<v Speaker 1>to a</v>

708
00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:38.440
<v Speaker 1>Jewish conspiracy theories.</v>

709
00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:40.240
<v Speaker 1>Mm.</v>

710
00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:42.490
<v Speaker 3>I really don't make too much sense to me.</v>

711
00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:43.483
<v Speaker 3>Mm,</v>

712
00:32:43.810 --> 00:32:44.643
<v Speaker 3>mm,</v>

713
00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:45.703
<v Speaker 3>mm,</v>

714
00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:51.263
<v Speaker 1>mm,</v>

715
00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:57.920
<v Speaker 3>mm,</v>

716
00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:58.770
<v Speaker 3>mm,</v>

717
00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:04.770
<v Speaker 3>mm.</v>

718
00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:14.840
<v Speaker 2>The idea that</v>

719
00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:19.240
<v Speaker 2>Jews are behind</v>

720
00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:23.710
<v Speaker 2>most of the ills of the world,</v>

721
00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:29.700
<v Speaker 2>I think most of the ills of a world can be chalked up to people,</v>

722
00:33:29.921 --> 00:33:30.754
<v Speaker 2>not a</v>

723
00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:34.840
<v Speaker 2>first a degradation in the family.</v>

724
00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:42.060
<v Speaker 2>That's the primary reason in the West for the breakdown of everything.</v>

725
00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:44.581
<v Speaker 2>The breakdown.</v>

726
00:33:44.581 --> 00:33:45.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what that means.</v>

727
00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:49.361
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

728
00:33:49.361 --> 00:33:54.361
<v Speaker 2>the thing is if people wanted to get up and start making noise like is being</v>

729
00:33:55.421 --> 00:33:56.560
<v Speaker 2>done in France,</v>

730
00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:58.213
<v Speaker 1>then</v>

731
00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:00.740
<v Speaker 2>things would change.</v>

732
00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:02.360
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

733
00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:07.360
<v Speaker 2>Frank Douglas has a famous quote that power concedes nothing unless people</v>

734
00:34:08.091 --> 00:34:08.924
<v Speaker 2>demand of it,</v>

735
00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:09.950
<v Speaker 2>and that's the truth.</v>

736
00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:12.020
<v Speaker 2>If people don't get out in the streets,</v>

737
00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:14.330
<v Speaker 2>then nothing happens.</v>

738
00:34:54.910 --> 00:34:55.743
<v Speaker 3>Mm</v>

739
00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:02.103
<v Speaker 3>minimalism</v>

740
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:31.030
<v Speaker 3>or anything?</v>

741
00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:37.743
<v Speaker 3>Mm.</v>

742
00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:39.050
<v Speaker 3>Mm,</v>

759
00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:35.200
<v Speaker 2>and that was only at one of his lectures.</v>

00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:43.740
<v Speaker 2>I felt kind of obligated to give back a little bit.</v>

762
00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:45.060
<v Speaker 2>How dare you resent your,</v>

772
00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:13.673
<v Speaker 5>know</v>

773
00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:21.030
<v Speaker 2>that van would have to be fairly nice size having one plate.</v>

774
00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:21.211
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

775

779
00:37:33.241 --> 00:37:35.550
<v Speaker 2>but it's a bunch of people you don't know.</v>

780
00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:40.390
<v Speaker 2>Not Everybody's going to want to eat off that one plate and use the same floor</v>

781
00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:41.243
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

782
00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:54.820
<v Speaker 2>Living in a van.</v>

783
00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:58.390
<v Speaker 2>There's a whole lot of people who live in vans now.</v>

784
00:37:58.391 --> 00:37:59.350
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of a big thing</v>

785
00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:02.181
<v Speaker 2>living in an rv.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He's living in vans.</v>

787
00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:04.820
<v Speaker 2>I guess in San Francisco.</v>

788
00:38:04.821 --> 00:38:08.240
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people have to live in their vehicles because they can't afford</v>

789
00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:10.240
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

790
00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:12.380
<v Speaker 2>Can't afford the real estate prices,</v>

791
00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:15.150
<v Speaker 5>whether it be renting or owning</v>

792
00:38:18.350 --> 00:38:20.630
<v Speaker 2>adjunct professors have to live in vans.</v>

793
00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:24.410
<v Speaker 2>People involved in Silicon Valley and live in vans.</v>

794
00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:25.823
<v Speaker 2>That kind of sucks.</v>

795
00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:28.533
<v Speaker 5>Hm,</v>

796
00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:32.023
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

797
00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:35.940
<v Speaker 3>Mm.</v>

798
00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:48.370
<v Speaker 2>I think that if a,</v>

799
00:38:52.050 --> 00:38:52.920
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to travel,</v>

800
00:38:52.921 --> 00:38:55.560
<v Speaker 2>maybe living in a van would be a cool thing,</v>

801
00:38:55.561 --> 00:38:56.394
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

802
00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:02.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm not interested that interested in traveling around the United States right</v>

803
00:39:02.761 --> 00:39:03.594
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

804
00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:20.220
<v Speaker 2>Minimal things anti-capitalism.</v>

805
00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:22.850
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

806
00:39:22.850 --> 00:39:24.350
<v Speaker 2>I got another little rant for you.</v>

807
00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:25.550
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

808
00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:30.550
<v Speaker 2>trump's whole thing with food chain and blaming China</v>

809
00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:32.573
<v Speaker 5>four.</v>

810
00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:37.211
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

811
00:39:37.211 --> 00:39:38.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't know exactly what he's blaming China for,</v>

812
00:39:38.951 --> 00:39:39.784
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

813
00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:44.880
<v Speaker 2>United States companies moved to China and though Chinese work in them,</v>

814
00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:50.260
<v Speaker 2>there's still a lot of American corporations that</v>

815
00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:53.521
<v Speaker 2>basically,</v>

816
00:39:53.521 --> 00:39:54.750
<v Speaker 2>or making things</v>

817
00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:01.390
<v Speaker 2>and the reason that a lot of the things that are made cheaply is because the</v>

818
00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:03.050
<v Speaker 2>bids are so low,</v>

819
00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:04.321
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

820
00:40:04.321 --> 00:40:05.154
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

821
00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:06.770
<v Speaker 2>you can only do,</v>

822
00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:10.370
<v Speaker 2>you can only make so much of something.</v>

823
00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:15.440
<v Speaker 2>You can only keep the quality of something so high when you're being paid so</v>

824
00:40:15.441 --> 00:40:16.274
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>

825
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.863
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

826
00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:19.040
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

827
00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:19.873
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

828
00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:22.910
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

829
00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:23.743
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

830
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:27.543
<v Speaker 5>that's what I've heard.</v>

831
00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:31.640
<v Speaker 2>But they probably do steel.</v>

832
00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:32.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

833
00:40:32.350 --> 00:40:33.183
<v Speaker 2>China is not good.</v>

834
00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:37.790
<v Speaker 2>That's not a good place in that they steal a lot of the,</v>

835
00:40:37.791 --> 00:40:38.624
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

836
00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:41.230
<v Speaker 5>a lot of,</v>

837
00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:42.063
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

838
00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:43.970
<v Speaker 2>technology when they can.</v>

839
00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:49.950
<v Speaker 2>But I've kind of find it interesting that people would think that a state would</v>

840
00:40:49.951 --> 00:40:52.650
<v Speaker 2>not mean a state is ruthless.</v>

841
00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:53.633
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

842
00:40:53.850 --> 00:40:55.710
<v Speaker 2>Our federal government is ruthless.</v>

843
00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:57.303
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

844
00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:00.831
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

845
00:41:00.831 --> 00:41:02.540
<v Speaker 2>when you're in the Geo political game,</v>

846
00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:05.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that there are any rules.</v>

847
00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:08.540
<v Speaker 2>I think it's basically what you can get away with.</v>

848
00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:10.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

849
00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:11.113
<v Speaker 2>and that's it.</v>

850
00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:13.263
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

851
00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:16.680
<v Speaker 2>When there's egg on your face when you take a step back,</v>

852
00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:17.543
<v Speaker 2>but it's</v>

853
00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:19.723
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

854
00:41:20.830 --> 00:41:21.663
<v Speaker 2>it's a different</v>

855
00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:25.270
<v Speaker 2>set of arrangements.</v>

856
00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:29.143
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

857
00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:32.500
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] you have any questions?</v>

858
00:41:32.501 --> 00:41:33.350

00:43:32.890 --> 00:43:33.723
<v Speaker 6>but</v>

891
00:43:34.770 --> 00:43:36.150
<v Speaker 5>where is all this going?</v>

892
00:43:39.690 --> 00:43:40.523
<v Speaker 5>Probably</v>

893
00:43:44.970 --> 00:43:46.470
<v Speaker 5>probably just more division.</v>

894
00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:49.410
<v Speaker 6>I couldn't see it going.</v>

895
00:43:49.411 --> 00:43:54.411
<v Speaker 6>I couldn't really see it going anywhere else besides that right now is social</v>

896
00:43:56.541 --> 00:43:57.620
<v Speaker 6>media to blame?</v>

897
00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:00.373
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

898
00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:06.710
<v Speaker 6>I believe that with Youtube and all specifically youtube,</v>

899
00:44:06.901 --> 00:44:07.980
<v Speaker 6>you have the comments section,</v>

900
00:44:07.981 --> 00:44:08.814
<v Speaker 6>you have a video,</v>

901
00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:10.210
<v Speaker 6>you watch something,</v>

902
00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:11.520
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

903
00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:12.990
<v Speaker 6>you got an idea or something,</v>

904
00:44:12.991 --> 00:44:14.850
<v Speaker 6>so you want to jot it down on the,</v>

905
00:44:14.851 --> 00:44:15.684
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

906
00:44:15.850 --> 00:44:16.683
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

907
00:44:16.770 --> 00:44:20.270
<v Speaker 6>in the comments section and then you think that you're,</v>

908
00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:20.791
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

909
00:44:20.791 --> 00:44:22.410
<v Speaker 6>you're responding to somebody.</v>

910
00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:24.630
<v Speaker 6>I think I've heard Sam Harris say something about this.</v>

911
00:44:24.930 --> 00:44:28.560
<v Speaker 6>It might've been somebody else and you think that you're,</v>

912
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:31.660
<v Speaker 5>you're</v>

913
00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:33.820
<v Speaker 6>entering into a conversation with somebody,</v>

914
00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:34.900
<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean?</v>

915
00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:35.291
<v Speaker 6>Like there's,</v>

916
00:44:35.291 --> 00:44:37.420
<v Speaker 6>this dialogue is being opened up and there's not,</v>

917
00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:38.441
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

918
00:44:38.441 --> 00:44:39.260
<v Speaker 6>it's basically,</v>

919
00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:39.551
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

920
00:44:39.551 --> 00:44:42.490
<v Speaker 6>I think it was Shapiro at some point you said something about that.</v>

921
00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:43.851
<v Speaker 6>The idea is,</v>

922
00:44:43.851 --> 00:44:46.960
<v Speaker 6>is that somebody posts a comment and you post a comment and somebody has already</v>

923
00:44:46.961 --> 00:44:47.890
<v Speaker 6>moved on,</v>

924
00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:48.820
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

925
00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:49.653
<v Speaker 6>their,</v>

926
00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:50.773
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

927
00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:53.493
<v Speaker 6>the uh,</v>

928
00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:55.630
<v Speaker 6>the context isn't</v>

929
00:44:58.090 --> 00:44:58.923
<v Speaker 6>there anymore,</v>

930
00:44:59.170 --> 00:45:00.003
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>

931
00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:02.110
<v Speaker 6>but social media to blame,</v>

932
00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:03.460
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

933
00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:07.480
<v Speaker 6>people face to face and people in the comments section or two entirely different</v>

934
00:45:07.481 --> 00:45:08.314
<v Speaker 6>things</v>

935
00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:12.580
<v Speaker 6>and people get really upset and</v>

936
00:45:14.830 --> 00:45:15.663
<v Speaker 5>about her</v>

937
00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:17.160
<v Speaker 6>in comment sections.</v>

938
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:18.720
<v Speaker 6>That probably wouldn't happen</v>

939
00:45:18.970 --> 00:45:20.400
<v Speaker 5>then I'm</v>

940
00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:25.760
<v Speaker 5>probably wouldn't happen in real life in reality.</v>

941
00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:31.633
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

942
00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:34.790
<v Speaker 6>I don't know where it's gone.</v>

943
00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:35.811
<v Speaker 6>Like I said,</v>

944
00:45:35.811 --> 00:45:36.644
<v Speaker 6>more division.</v>

945
00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:38.960
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

946
00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:44.721
<v Speaker 6>put the guitar down.</v>

947
00:45:44.721 --> 00:45:45.271
<v Speaker 6>When you speak,</v>

948
00:45:45.271 --> 00:45:46.970
<v Speaker 6>he's use your hands to emphasize points.</v>

949
00:45:46.971 --> 00:45:48.590
<v Speaker 6>You'll be a much stronger speaker.</v>

950
00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:49.463
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

951

956
00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:07.900

1041
00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:18.921
<v Speaker 6>What do you think?</v>

1042
00:51:18.921 --> 00:51:20.420
<v Speaker 6>Jesus Christ came to divide.</v>

1043
00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:21.980
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

1044
00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:23.230
<v Speaker 6>is that what that is about?</v>

1045
00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:24.620
<v Speaker 6>The Salvation Army band.</v>

1046
00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:29.120
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if somebody was blasting some music.</v>

1047
00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:30.710
<v Speaker 6>I heard a uh.</v>

1048
00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:30.951
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

1049
00:51:30.951 --> 00:51:31.191
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1050
00:51:31.191 --> 00:51:31.551
<v Speaker 6>you're right.</v>

1051
00:51:31.551 --> 00:51:32.181
<v Speaker 6>That's what it is.</v>

1052
00:51:32.181 --> 00:51:32.711
<v Speaker 6>It's the,</v>

1053
00:51:32.711 --> 00:51:33.450
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1054
00:51:33.450 --> 00:51:35.870
<v Speaker 6>the subdivision that I live in,</v>

1055
00:51:35.871 --> 00:51:39.020
<v Speaker 6>the homeowner's association is really involved,</v>

1056
00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:42.460
<v Speaker 6>so there's a,</v>

1057
00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:45.320
<v Speaker 6>a it bring the firetrucks around.</v>

1058
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:49.850
<v Speaker 5>I'll have music playing</v>

1059
00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:01.260
<v Speaker 5>this Christmas will be a little bit more difficult.</v>

1060
00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:06.510
<v Speaker 5>Well this whole past few months have been difficult because my father died in</v>

1061
00:52:06.511 --> 00:52:07.344
<v Speaker 5>July,</v>

1062
00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:11.250
<v Speaker 5>has been tough.</v>

1063
00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:35.790
<v Speaker 5>Mm MM.</v>

1064
00:52:40.570 --> 00:52:40.841
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1065
00:52:40.841 --> 00:52:41.674
<v Speaker 5>I don't really</v>

1066
00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:46.030
<v Speaker 5>have that much more to,</v>

1067
00:52:50.790 --> 00:52:53.910
<v Speaker 6>and they contribute and lost the dashboard.</v>

1068
00:52:59.750 --> 00:53:00.800
<v Speaker 6>How did he pass?</v>

1069
00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:10.893
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1070
00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:15.613
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

1071
00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:17.300
<v Speaker 6>didn't have cancer.</v>

1072
00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:19.820
<v Speaker 6>The cancers would kill them.</v>

1073
00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:23.920
<v Speaker 6>I think an infection in his money</v>

1074
00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:27.193
<v Speaker 6>and infection,</v>

1075
00:53:27.460 --> 00:53:28.600
<v Speaker 6>I believe killed him.</v>

1076
00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:40.653
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1077
00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:47.820
<v Speaker 6>He had a soft Gel,</v>

1078
00:53:47.821 --> 00:53:50.940
<v Speaker 6>cancer in 2004.</v>

1079
00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:52.980
<v Speaker 6>He was involved in an auto accident,</v>

1080
00:53:53.010 --> 00:53:53.843
<v Speaker 6>which he,</v>

1081
00:53:53.950 --> 00:53:54.800
<v Speaker 6>it was a not,</v>

1082
00:53:55.380 --> 00:53:56.340
<v Speaker 6>he wasn't at fault.</v>

1083
00:53:56.341 --> 00:53:56.671
<v Speaker 6>Basically.</v>

1084
00:53:56.671 --> 00:53:59.220
<v Speaker 6>He was at a red light and a guy driving a vehicle</v>

1085
00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:06.280
<v Speaker 6>dropped his phone when I had a to go grab his phone and instead of hitting the</v>

1086
00:54:07.221 --> 00:54:12.221
<v Speaker 6>brake pedal the gas pedal and accelerated into my dad sitting at a red light.</v>

1087
00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:15.440
<v Speaker 6>And of course you know,</v>

1088
00:54:15.441 --> 00:54:16.520
<v Speaker 6>is a domino effect.</v>

1089
00:54:16.521 --> 00:54:18.390
<v Speaker 6>My Dad went ahead and hit another car,</v>

1090
00:54:18.391 --> 00:54:19.760
<v Speaker 6>so it was a bad accident for him.</v>

1091
00:54:19.761 --> 00:54:22.250
<v Speaker 6>And a few other people in my dad had some</v>

1092
00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:24.920
<v Speaker 6>extremely bad headaches.</v>

1093
00:54:24.921 --> 00:54:26.030
<v Speaker 6>So he would take it,</v>

1094
00:54:26.210 --> 00:54:30.520
<v Speaker 6>be popping tylenol three or four a day and a</v>

1095
00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:33.770
<v Speaker 5>sure enough,</v>

1096
00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:35.793
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1097
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:41.580
<v Speaker 6>once his cancer was diagnosed and we were surprised that it,</v>

1098
00:54:42.770 --> 00:54:47.770
<v Speaker 6>that it wasn't as far as we could tell primarily in his lungs.</v>

1099
00:54:48.830 --> 00:54:51.020
<v Speaker 6>That is a soften that,</v>

1100
00:54:52.070 --> 00:54:53.870
<v Speaker 6>so there's a correlation that's been found,</v>

1101
00:54:53.930 --> 00:54:54.763
<v Speaker 6>a,</v>

1102
00:54:54.980 --> 00:54:59.980
<v Speaker 6>there's medical articles that found a correlation between asset ace and</v>

1103
00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:00.873
<v Speaker 6>medicine,</v>

1104
00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:06.020
<v Speaker 6>which is something that allows the medication to be absorbed quicker.</v>

1105
00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:08.430
<v Speaker 6>I believe as a metaphor,</v>

1106
00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:09.230
<v Speaker 6>a metaphor.</v>

1107
00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:11.330
<v Speaker 6>It's like tylenol and asymmetric when,</v>

1108
00:55:11.331 --> 00:55:13.250
<v Speaker 6>like when you get a hydrocodone,</v>

1109
00:55:13.370 --> 00:55:15.480
<v Speaker 6>hydrocodone for pain reliever,</v>

1110
00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:17.660
<v Speaker 6>like when you have your wisdom tooth pulled out,</v>

1111
00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:20.390
<v Speaker 6>which I just had recently,</v>

1112
00:55:20.391 --> 00:55:21.890
<v Speaker 6>you probably can't see it on the screen,</v>

1113
00:55:22.580 --> 00:55:23.600
<v Speaker 6>but um,</v>

1114
00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:29.450
<v Speaker 6>I believe that allows your body to absorb the pain reliever,</v>

1115
00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:30.650
<v Speaker 6>the hydrocodone,</v>

1116
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:32.450
<v Speaker 6>the opioid more effectively.</v>

1117
00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:33.110
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1118
00:55:33.110 --> 00:55:34.450
<v Speaker 6>but uh,</v>

1119
00:55:35.110 --> 00:55:36.770
<v Speaker 6>as a matter of fin is also correlated</v>

1120
00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:38.550
<v Speaker 5>with a,</v>

1121
00:55:38.550 --> 00:55:39.383
<v Speaker 5>like an</v>

1122
00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:43.460
<v Speaker 6>longterm use is correlated with esophageal cancer.</v>

1123
00:55:45.690 --> 00:55:46.523
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

1124
00:55:48.450 --> 00:55:51.390
<v Speaker 6>for awhile I thought that's what Gildan tylenol and not cigarettes.</v>

1125
00:55:51.391 --> 00:55:53.070
<v Speaker 6>He smoked cigarettes quite a bit,</v>

1126
00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:55.830
<v Speaker 6>but I don't think it was cigarettes,</v>

1127
00:55:56.250 --> 00:55:56.401
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1128
00:55:56.401 --> 00:55:59.040
<v Speaker 6>some people have the genes for it and some people don't and I don't think the</v>

1129
00:55:59.041 --> 00:56:00.060
<v Speaker 6>cigarettes when we've got them.</v>

1130
00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:03.173
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1131
00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:10.413
<v Speaker 6>so</v>

1132
00:56:11.380 --> 00:56:12.213
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1133
00:56:12.930 --> 00:56:14.760
<v Speaker 6>open up a bit about yourself.</v>

1134
00:56:17.580 --> 00:56:17.761
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1135
00:56:17.761 --> 00:56:18.660
<v Speaker 6>my mind's gone blank.</v>

1136
00:56:18.661 --> 00:56:19.494
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

1137
00:56:20.790 --> 00:56:21.623
<v Speaker 6>What do you want to know?</v>

1138
00:56:22.350 --> 00:56:23.020
<v Speaker 6>I didn't know that.</v>

1139
00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:24.310
<v Speaker 6>It's made from the poison</v>

1140
00:56:24.370 --> 00:56:25.390
<v Speaker 2>from apricots,</v>

1141
00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:29.170
<v Speaker 2>like what does it synthesized from the Afrikaans or something?</v>

1142
00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:31.313
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1143
00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:34.610
<v Speaker 2>Cancer is a rebellion within the body.</v>

1144
00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:38.173
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1145
00:56:45.090 --> 00:56:45.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1146
00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:45.831
<v Speaker 2>Well I'm,</v>

1147
00:56:45.831 --> 00:56:46.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm upset.</v>

1148
00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:51.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm the ad revenue that I was getting from Peterson's reposting things pretty</v>

1149
00:56:53.241 --> 00:56:54.340
<v Speaker 2>substantial for awhile</v>

1150
00:56:56.290 --> 00:56:57.660
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1151
00:56:57.710 --> 00:56:59.360
<v Speaker 2>Youtube sent me a letter saying,</v>

1152
00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:05.500
<v Speaker 2>sent me a letter saying that I need permission.</v>

1153
00:57:05.501 --> 00:57:10.501
<v Speaker 2>I went ahead and looked for an email and of course I think it's Peterson's</v>

1154
00:57:10.751 --> 00:57:11.351
<v Speaker 2>publicist.</v>

1155
00:57:11.351 --> 00:57:12.520
<v Speaker 2>The handle is emails,</v>

1156
00:57:14.140 --> 00:57:17.740
<v Speaker 2>but I was hoping to maybe get and eat,</v>

1157
00:57:18.030 --> 00:57:18.863
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1158
00:57:18.970 --> 00:57:20.710
<v Speaker 2>an email from him or somebody</v>

1159
00:57:22.310 --> 00:57:26.410
<v Speaker 2>so that I could go ahead and forward that to youtube and maybe get my channelry</v>

1160
00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:27.280
<v Speaker 2>monetized.</v>

1161
00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:30.473
<v Speaker 5>I</v>

1162
00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:32.353
<v Speaker 5>mean like,</v>

1163
00:57:32.550 --> 00:57:33.383
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1164
00:57:37.010 --> 00:57:37.843
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1165
00:57:44.990 --> 00:57:47.030
<v Speaker 2>So that may not happen</v>

1166
00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:48.613
<v Speaker 5>and</v>

1167
00:57:50.410 --> 00:57:53.020
<v Speaker 2>if it doesn't then I should find something else to do with this.</v>

1168
00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:55.450
<v Speaker 2>With this channel.</v>

1169
00:57:55.450 --> 00:57:57.400
<v Speaker 2>Your commentary on Peterson is permissible.</v>

1170
00:58:00.590 --> 00:58:00.771
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1171
00:58:00.771 --> 00:58:02.030
<v Speaker 2>But is it monetizeable?</v>

1172
00:58:04.020 --> 00:58:05.030
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1173
00:58:07.580 --> 00:58:09.860
<v Speaker 2>I didn't start doing the clip thing for the money,</v>

1174
00:58:09.861 --> 00:58:13.640
<v Speaker 2>but when the money started rolling it was kind of Nice and I thought,</v>

1175
00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:13.791
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1176
00:58:13.791 --> 00:58:14.870
<v Speaker 2>this is decent,</v>

1177
00:58:14.871 --> 00:58:15.561
<v Speaker 2>this is decent.</v>

1178
00:58:15.561 --> 00:58:17.960
<v Speaker 2>And they're just like hockey sticked</v>

1179
00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:19.733
<v Speaker 5>and then,</v>

1180
00:58:21.710 --> 00:58:23.720
<v Speaker 2>and then when I,</v>

1181
00:58:23.930 --> 00:58:28.930
<v Speaker 2>the the video that I uploaded that get the most views and the shortest amount of</v>

1182
00:58:29.511 --> 00:58:32.660
<v Speaker 2>time was an accident because I was clipping like five minute,</v>

1183
00:58:33.170 --> 00:58:34.640
<v Speaker 2>five minute long clips.</v>

1184
00:58:35.450 --> 00:58:36.283
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1185
00:58:36.650 --> 00:58:37.483
<v Speaker 5>And</v>

1186
00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:43.640
<v Speaker 2>I accidentally put a posted because I had ripped the video and then I went ahead</v>

1187
00:58:44.461 --> 00:58:47.580
<v Speaker 2>and clicked it like I had like three clips done.</v>

1188
00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:50.940
<v Speaker 2>And then I excellent closed one of the folders.</v>

1189
00:58:50.941 --> 00:58:52.500
<v Speaker 2>So I went pack open the folder,</v>

1190
00:58:52.501 --> 00:58:53.430
<v Speaker 2>drag it over to the,</v>

1191
00:58:53.490 --> 00:58:54.300
<v Speaker 2>to the uh,</v>

1192
00:58:54.300 --> 00:58:59.300
<v Speaker 2>upload thing and I'm uploaded it and I'm thinking I'm looking at it thinking</v>

1193
00:59:03.121 --> 00:59:03.751
<v Speaker 2>what the hell?</v>

1194
00:59:03.751 --> 00:59:06.930
<v Speaker 2>And it took 15 minutes to upload and it was getting stock interview right after</v>

1195
00:59:06.931 --> 00:59:07.500
<v Speaker 2>the cat,</v>

1196
00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:08.333
<v Speaker 2>Kathy Newman.</v>

1197
00:59:08.910 --> 00:59:09.721
<v Speaker 2>And I'm sitting here like,</v>

1198
00:59:09.721 --> 00:59:10.381
<v Speaker 2>what the hell?</v>

1199
00:59:10.381 --> 00:59:11.940
<v Speaker 2>Why did this video take so long?</v>

1200
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:13.320
<v Speaker 2>Why is it taking so long to upload?</v>

1201
00:59:13.530 --> 00:59:15.510
<v Speaker 2>And of course I'm doing something else,</v>

1202
00:59:15.511 --> 00:59:16.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1203
00:59:16.010 --> 00:59:17.610
<v Speaker 2>I have a desktop computer.</v>

1204
00:59:17.611 --> 00:59:20.940
<v Speaker 2>I was doing something talking to my friends and I go back and look at my.</v>

1205
00:59:21.530 --> 00:59:22.840
<v Speaker 2>And I go back and I'm,</v>

1206
00:59:22.850 --> 00:59:24.110
<v Speaker 2>what the hell is taken so long?</v>

1207
00:59:24.111 --> 00:59:24.711
<v Speaker 2>And sure enough,</v>

1208
00:59:24.711 --> 00:59:26.330
<v Speaker 2>I have uploaded the full,</v>

1209
00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:28.970
<v Speaker 2>the full video and out of sheer laziness,</v>

1210
00:59:28.971 --> 00:59:29.900
<v Speaker 2>I just thought to myself,</v>

1211
00:59:30.260 --> 00:59:31.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even gonna worry about it.</v>

1212
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:33.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm just gonna Hey Joe,</v>

1213
00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:37.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to let it hang out and whatever.</v>

1214
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:39.220
<v Speaker 2>I'll just get up Rhonda,</v>

1215
00:59:39.250 --> 00:59:42.620
<v Speaker 2>load another video and then sure enough,</v>

1216
00:59:42.621 --> 00:59:44.690
<v Speaker 2>20 minutes go by and you know,</v>

1217
00:59:44.691 --> 00:59:45.381
<v Speaker 2>I would check,</v>

1218
00:59:45.381 --> 00:59:46.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1219
00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:50.240
<v Speaker 2>I would check the analytics and I'm looking at it and you know,</v>

1220
00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:51.113
<v Speaker 2>I'm</v>

1221
00:59:52.430 --> 00:59:54.410
<v Speaker 2>pretty good about</v>

1222
00:59:57.050 --> 00:59:59.060
<v Speaker 2>what statistics I should be following on.</v>

1223
00:59:59.810 --> 01:00:01.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm not good with statistics,</v>

1224
01:00:01.071 --> 01:00:04.040
<v Speaker 2>but average is I should be following.</v>

1225
01:00:04.041 --> 01:00:04.461
<v Speaker 2>And it was like,</v>

1226
01:00:04.461 --> 01:00:04.671
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1227
01:00:04.671 --> 01:00:05.600
<v Speaker 2>this is like way,</v>

1228
01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:11.540
<v Speaker 2>way beyond what I thought and then then I just kinda got greedy at that point.</v>

1229
01:00:11.541 --> 01:00:14.150
<v Speaker 2>I just started just what the hell.</v>

1230
01:00:14.330 --> 01:00:19.250
<v Speaker 2>And just start like taking until you hand gets slapped.</v>

1231
01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:21.441
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1232
01:00:21.441 --> 01:00:22.274
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1233
01:00:22.790 --> 01:00:23.091
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1234
01:00:23.091 --> 01:00:23.960
<v Speaker 2>it's just like,</v>

1235
01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:28.850
<v Speaker 2>you wonder why things don't change in the states,</v>

1236
01:00:28.851 --> 01:00:29.151
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1237
01:00:29.151 --> 01:00:32.660
<v Speaker 2>why you have a for profit healthcare system that the insurance companies own</v>

1238
01:00:32.661 --> 01:00:34.370
<v Speaker 2>everything and you know,</v>

1239
01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:34.940
<v Speaker 2>everyone's,</v>

1240
01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:36.350
<v Speaker 2>everyone wants to make it out.</v>

1241
01:00:36.351 --> 01:00:36.591
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1242
01:00:36.591 --> 01:00:37.220
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1243
01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:38.060
<v Speaker 2>can't change.</v>

1244
01:00:38.061 --> 01:00:39.230
<v Speaker 2>And it's for the better.</v>

1245
01:00:39.231 --> 01:00:40.064
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

1246
01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:42.560
<v Speaker 2>that's bullshit.</v>

1247
01:00:43.490 --> 01:00:44.550
<v Speaker 2>The only reason it doesn't change,</v>

1248
01:00:44.551 --> 01:00:45.950
<v Speaker 2>just because you don't see people out in the street,</v>

1249
01:00:45.951 --> 01:00:46.784
<v Speaker 2>like in France,</v>

1250
01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:49.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's so bad in the states that,</v>

1251
01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:54.240
<v Speaker 2>that doctors make mistakes and people die and people aren't accountable.</v>

1252
01:00:56.330 --> 01:00:57.740
<v Speaker 2>And in Europe there</v>

1253
01:00:59.440 --> 01:00:59.921
<v Speaker 2>they're uh,</v>

1254
01:00:59.921 --> 01:01:00.581
<v Speaker 2>in France,</v>

1255
01:01:00.581 --> 01:01:01.414
<v Speaker 2>they're a,</v>

1256
01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:03.783
<v Speaker 4>there a,</v>

1257
01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:08.193
<v Speaker 4>what do you call it,</v>

1258
01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:09.873
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

1259
01:01:10.550 --> 01:01:15.550
<v Speaker 2>they're protesting over diesel tax and people are dying in the states because of</v>

1260
01:01:16.131 --> 01:01:20.390
<v Speaker 2>malpractice because they're not valuable enough because they can't,</v>

1261
01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:22.280
<v Speaker 2>they don't have as much money,</v>

1262
01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:23.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1263
01:01:23.330 --> 01:01:27.050
<v Speaker 2>their insurance company is not the company that is not the type of insurance</v>

1264
01:01:27.051 --> 01:01:28.460
<v Speaker 2>that your doctor will take.</v>

1265
01:01:28.461 --> 01:01:32.180
<v Speaker 2>Lucky for me at the few things that I've had recently,</v>

1266
01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:34.160
<v Speaker 2>I've just been able to pay with cash,</v>

1267
01:01:34.161 --> 01:01:35.190
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1268
01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:36.640
<v Speaker 2>that's not the case with a,</v>

1269
01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:38.030
<v Speaker 2>with a lot of people.</v>

1270
01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:41.083
<v Speaker 2>Hey Adam.</v>

1271
01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:45.050
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

1272
01:01:45.050 --> 01:01:47.060
<v Speaker 2>things won't change in the states until people</v>

1273
01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:50.630
<v Speaker 2>get up.</v>

1274
01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:52.100
<v Speaker 2>Which now,</v>

1275
01:01:52.170 --> 01:01:53.003
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1276
01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:57.560
<v Speaker 2>The states seemed like the most isolated nation on planet earth.</v>

1277
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:02.410
<v Speaker 2>Cash is king.</v>

1278
01:02:02.411 --> 01:02:03.244
<v Speaker 2>Who is the Queen?</v>

1279
01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:07.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1280
01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:08.773
<v Speaker 2>How old are you?</v>

1281
01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:11.213
<v Speaker 4>Really old?</v>

1282
01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:15.160
<v Speaker 2>Let me guess.</v>

1283
01:02:15.370 --> 01:02:16.203
<v Speaker 2>Credit.</v>

1284
01:02:18.370 --> 01:02:18.581
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1285
01:02:18.581 --> 01:02:19.020
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

1286
01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:19.320
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

1287
01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:20.070
<v Speaker 2>I've heard that the</v>

1288
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:25.070
<v Speaker 5>average person has $60,000 in credit card debt.</v>

1289
01:02:28.130 --> 01:02:28.963
<v Speaker 2>That's unreal.</v>

1290
01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:33.090
<v Speaker 2>I just use my,</v>

1291
01:02:33.090 --> 01:02:33.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1292
01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:38.020
<v Speaker 2>I just use my credit card to build credit,</v>

1293
01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:38.860
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1294
01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:41.710
<v Speaker 2>Keeping the account open for six months to a year.</v>

1295
01:02:42.370 --> 01:02:43.390
<v Speaker 2>Close it open.</v>

1296
01:02:43.391 --> 01:02:44.224
<v Speaker 2>Another one.</v>

1297
01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:47.450
<v Speaker 2>We're ruled by Queen.</v>

1298
01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:48.441
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing good.</v>

1299
01:02:48.441 --> 01:02:50.470
<v Speaker 2>I only have 59,000.</v>

1300
01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:55.311
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1301
01:02:55.311 --> 01:02:55.411
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1302
01:02:55.411 --> 01:02:56.244
<v Speaker 2>I'm 31.</v>

1303
01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:02.310
<v Speaker 2>We are ruled by Queen.</v>

1304
01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:03.450
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1305
01:03:03.450 --> 01:03:04.283
<v Speaker 2>that means.</v>

1306
01:03:10.230 --> 01:03:10.411
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1307
01:03:10.411 --> 01:03:11.244
<v Speaker 2>there's not a whole lot.</v>

1308
01:03:14.140 --> 01:03:16.120
<v Speaker 2>I never enter into these with really anything to</v>

1309
01:03:18.490 --> 01:03:18.911
<v Speaker 2>say.</v>

1310
01:03:18.911 --> 01:03:19.744
<v Speaker 2>Partly because I'm</v>

1311
01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:21.993
<v Speaker 2>lazy.</v>

1312
01:03:22.510 --> 01:03:22.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean this,</v>

1313
01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:25.810
<v Speaker 2>this entire thing was a test to see if my dslr would</v>

1314
01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:28.600
<v Speaker 2>with handled the</v>

1315
01:03:33.030 --> 01:03:33.863
<v Speaker 2>would handle</v>

1316
01:03:35.370 --> 01:03:36.203
<v Speaker 2>will be functional.</v>

1317
01:03:39.650 --> 01:03:40.483
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

1318
01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:44.220
<v Speaker 2>I think next time we'll change the lenses so I get a bit of f stop so I don't</v>

1319
01:03:44.221 --> 01:03:45.060
<v Speaker 2>have to use this.</v>

1320
01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:48.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to use this light.</v>

1321
01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.070
<v Speaker 2>I turned it down.</v>

1322
01:03:52.260 --> 01:03:55.740
<v Speaker 2>Delays so much on the computer that I can immediately tell.</v>

1323
01:03:55.741 --> 01:03:56.574
<v Speaker 2>What</v>

1324
01:03:57.540 --> 01:03:59.010
<v Speaker 2>did we pass your test?</v>

1325
01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:09.273
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1326
01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:10.480
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1327
01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:11.313
<v Speaker 2>Adam,</v>

1328
01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:13.540
<v Speaker 2>if you're still here.</v>

1329
01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:15.513
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1330
01:04:15.850 --> 01:04:16.301
<v Speaker 2>funny enough.</v>

1331
01:04:16.301 --> 01:04:18.550
<v Speaker 2>Before you posted that Richard Wolf,</v>

1332
01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:20.860
<v Speaker 2>that video on Richard Wolff,</v>

1333
01:04:21.070 --> 01:04:22.270
<v Speaker 2>I had actually been watching,</v>

1334
01:04:23.420 --> 01:04:24.253
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1335
01:04:28.070 --> 01:04:29.900
<v Speaker 2>I had been watching things on like Russia,</v>

1336
01:04:29.901 --> 01:04:30.734
<v Speaker 2>TV,</v>

1337
01:04:31.230 --> 01:04:31.700
<v Speaker 2>Russia,</v>

1338
01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:32.151
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>

1339
01:04:32.151 --> 01:04:37.151
<v Speaker 2>that channel and along with Chris Hedges on contact,</v>

1340
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:41.800
<v Speaker 2>I had seen Richard Wolf and not,</v>

1341
01:04:41.810 --> 01:04:43.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't really know so much about the.</v>

1342
01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:47.193
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1343
01:04:58.720 --> 01:04:59.553
<v Speaker 5>hold on.</v>

1344
01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:03.240
<v Speaker 2>The camera died.</v>

1345
01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:05.370
<v Speaker 2>Let me replace the battery.</v>

1346
01:05:25.140 --> 01:05:25.261
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1347
01:05:25.261 --> 01:05:25.590
<v Speaker 2>we got.</v>

1348
01:05:25.590 --> 01:05:26.423
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1349
01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:31.060
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1350
01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:32.160
<v Speaker 2>that's the battery's dead.</v>

1351
01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:35.080
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1352
01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:36.953
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1353
01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:44.503
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1354
01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:47.180
<v Speaker 2>Sounds like he's wrestling liberals.</v>

1355
01:05:49.690 --> 01:05:54.690
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1356
01:06:12.070 --> 01:06:13.010
<v Speaker 2>and this is a,</v>

1357
01:06:14.410 --> 01:06:15.500
<v Speaker 2>this is kind of difficult.</v>

1358
01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:25.430
<v Speaker 2>Oh Damn.</v>

1359
01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:27.320
<v Speaker 2>Delay is so bad on the computer that I can't.</v>

1360
01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:06.951
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1361
01:07:06.951 --> 01:07:07.784
<v Speaker 2>nice.</v>

1362
01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:08.650
<v Speaker 2>Should,</v>

1363
01:07:08.650 --> 01:07:09.590
<v Speaker 2>should be able to see me now.</v>

1364
01:07:17.190 --> 01:07:17.431
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1365
01:07:17.431 --> 01:07:18.264
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1366
01:07:23.790 --> 01:07:27.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't really like the whole idea of hating liberals.</v>

1367
01:07:28.730 --> 01:07:29.460
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1368
01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:30.540
<v Speaker 2>the whole idea was that</v>

1369
01:07:32.190 --> 01:07:32.970
<v Speaker 2>there again,</v>

1370
01:07:32.970 --> 01:07:36.000
<v Speaker 2>the same people that bought the better living standards of the American employee</v>

1371
01:07:36.450 --> 01:07:38.490
<v Speaker 2>were socialists and communists,</v>

1372
01:07:39.030 --> 01:07:42.300
<v Speaker 2>the industrial workers of the world marching in the early 20th century,</v>

1373
01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:45.900
<v Speaker 2>striking alongside workers as they could have a better living standard.</v>

1374
01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:48.780
<v Speaker 2>Those people were liberals and there again,</v>

1375
01:07:48.781 --> 01:07:51.990
<v Speaker 2>if they hadn't existed that,</v>

1376
01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:52.411
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1377
01:07:52.411 --> 01:07:53.910
<v Speaker 2>the majority of us would,</v>

1378
01:07:54.490 --> 01:07:55.323
<v Speaker 2>uh.</v>

1379
01:07:55.950 --> 01:07:56.101
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1380
01:07:56.101 --> 01:07:57.900
<v Speaker 2>I can understand your thing with abortion there,</v>

1381
01:07:57.901 --> 01:07:58.530
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

1382
01:07:58.530 --> 01:08:03.530
<v Speaker 2>but the whole idea that if they hadn't existed that the American worker would be</v>

1383
01:08:04.830 --> 01:08:07.860
<v Speaker 2>paid probably as much as the Chinese worker,</v>

1384
01:08:07.861 --> 01:08:08.694
<v Speaker 2>if not less.</v>

1385
01:08:09.150 --> 01:08:09.983
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1386
01:08:10.530 --> 01:08:11.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1387
01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:12.450
<v Speaker 2>the American living standard,</v>

1388
01:08:12.540 --> 01:08:14.040
<v Speaker 2>we owe unfold,</v>

1389
01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:15.290
<v Speaker 2>but unfortunately,</v>

1390
01:08:15.290 --> 01:08:16.130
<v Speaker 2>but we owe</v>

1391
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:20.390
<v Speaker 6>to people who were self-described communists and socialists in a large,</v>

1392
01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:21.253
<v Speaker 6>in large part</v>

1393
01:08:23.570 --> 01:08:25.490
<v Speaker 6>had the strikes occurred without them,</v>

1394
01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:26.271
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>

1395
01:08:26.271 --> 01:08:27.170
<v Speaker 6>but they were the,</v>

1396
01:08:27.490 --> 01:08:28.323
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1397
01:08:28.930 --> 01:08:30.200
<v Speaker 6>the industrial workers of the world.</v>

1398
01:08:30.201 --> 01:08:32.720
<v Speaker 6>The wobblies were the ones that get the credit.</v>

1399
01:08:34.610 --> 01:08:37.790
<v Speaker 6>You don't learn that in school that much.</v>

1400
01:08:37.820 --> 01:08:39.530
<v Speaker 6>So I don't like the idea of really hating</v>

1401
01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:41.611
<v Speaker 5>liberals,</v>

1402
01:08:41.611 --> 01:08:42.444
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

1403
01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:46.010
<v Speaker 6>I guess I guess the whole thing is that,</v>

1404
01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:46.401
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1405
01:08:46.401 --> 01:08:46.601
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

1406
01:08:46.601 --> 01:08:47.840
<v Speaker 6>it's a catchall term</v>

1407
01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:51.271
<v Speaker 6>in a lot of ways.</v>

1408
01:08:51.271 --> 01:08:52.480
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of catch all terms,</v>

1409
01:08:52.481 --> 01:08:53.314
<v Speaker 6>like</v>

1410
01:08:55.420 --> 01:08:58.180
<v Speaker 6>neoliberalism is a catchall,</v>

1411
01:09:07.730 --> 01:09:08.370
<v Speaker 6>but I guess yeah,</v>

1412
01:09:08.370 --> 01:09:09.290
<v Speaker 6>I could see what you mean.</v>

1413
01:09:09.370 --> 01:09:09.650
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1414
01:09:09.650 --> 01:09:11.970
<v Speaker 6>I don't even consider kids out in the street and colleges,</v>

1415
01:09:11.980 --> 01:09:12.481
<v Speaker 6>liberals,</v>

1416
01:09:12.481 --> 01:09:13.170
<v Speaker 6>they're just,</v>

1417
01:09:13.170 --> 01:09:16.070
<v Speaker 6>they're just kids doing stupid shit.</v>

1418
01:09:16.130 --> 01:09:18.800
<v Speaker 6>Maybe they didn't get the anchor of their system when they were young,</v>

1419
01:09:19.890 --> 01:09:20.723
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1420
01:09:22.260 --> 01:09:23.093
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1421
01:09:36.820 --> 01:09:37.653
<v Speaker 6>So yeah,</v>

1422
01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:46.210
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>

1423
01:09:46.210 --> 01:09:47.043
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1424
01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.400
<v Speaker 6>I don't really want to play any,</v>

1425
01:09:53.401 --> 01:09:54.234
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1426
01:09:55.590 --> 01:10:00.590
<v Speaker 6>any youtube videos because like playing on the screen because if I do that I</v>

1427
01:10:04.441 --> 01:10:06.360
<v Speaker 6>could get a copy struck,</v>

1428
01:10:07.930 --> 01:10:08.880
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

1429
01:10:09.870 --> 01:10:10.710
<v Speaker 5>Don't want that.</v>

1430
01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:16.310
<v Speaker 6>That's the one thing I'm happy about is that I only have to deal with copyright</v>

1431
01:10:16.311 --> 01:10:17.210
<v Speaker 6>strikes right now.</v>

1432
01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:22.910
<v Speaker 6>Jordan Peterson's maps.</v>

1433
01:10:22.911 --> 01:10:23.271
<v Speaker 6>A meeting.</v>

1434
01:10:23.271 --> 01:10:24.560
<v Speaker 6>That's not a good title.</v>

1435
01:10:31.870 --> 01:10:32.880
<v Speaker 6>Does the truth hang out?</v>

1436
01:10:32.890 --> 01:10:33.723
<v Speaker 6>That's a better.</v>

1437
01:10:45.180 --> 01:10:46.013
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1438
01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:52.030
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1439
01:10:52.030 --> 01:10:54.220
<v Speaker 6>I don't have anybody on here to talk with,</v>

1440
01:10:54.221 --> 01:10:55.054
<v Speaker 6>so</v>

1441
01:11:09.990 --> 01:11:11.240
<v Speaker 6>my face has a box on it.</v>

1442
01:11:11.241 --> 01:11:12.074
<v Speaker 6>I'll fix that.</v>

1443
01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:27.090
<v Speaker 2>It's a leveling function.</v>

1444
01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:31.651
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

1445
01:11:31.651 --> 01:11:32.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm upside down.</v>

1446
01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:34.270
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1447
01:11:36.110 --> 01:11:36.290
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1448
01:11:36.290 --> 01:11:37.250
<v Speaker 2>just like the penguins,</v>

1449
01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:37.821
<v Speaker 2>the penguins are.</v>

1450
01:11:37.821 --> 01:11:38.654
<v Speaker 2>Writes that up.</v>

1451
01:11:41.330 --> 01:11:41.541
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1452
01:11:41.541 --> 01:11:42.374
<v Speaker 2>it's better now.</v>

1453
01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:51.080
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

1454
01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:51.913
<v Speaker 2>And I am.</v>

1455
01:11:56.970 --> 01:11:58.460
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>

1456
01:11:59.860 --> 01:12:01.480
<v Speaker 2>What's more enjoyable for the penguins?</v>

1457
01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:04.330
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know what to do.</v>

1458
01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:09.010
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I should bring the camera with me and film me installing a kitchen.</v>

1459
01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:12.790
<v Speaker 2>Maybe overlay it with some commentary.</v>

1460
01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:15.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how fitting it would be for this channel.</v>

1461
01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:24.120
<v Speaker 2>I have the idea of going back and actually taking every single one of the videos</v>

1462
01:12:25.361 --> 01:12:25.931
<v Speaker 2>that I've put out,</v>

1463
01:12:25.931 --> 01:12:28.180
<v Speaker 2>which is probably an 800 now</v>

1464
01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:32.590
<v Speaker 2>every single video and basically</v>

1465
01:12:35.170 --> 01:12:40.030
<v Speaker 2>cutting it up and putting commentary over every single one so I can.</v>

1466
01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:41.853
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1467
01:12:42.490 --> 01:12:44.020
<v Speaker 5>that might not be such a bad idea.</v>

1468
01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:46.593
<v Speaker 5>That would</v>

1469
01:12:46.980 --> 01:12:48.270
<v Speaker 2>potentially qualify,</v>

1470
01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:49.711
<v Speaker 2>but then you know,</v>

1471
01:12:49.711 --> 01:12:49.901
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1472
01:12:49.901 --> 01:12:50.790
<v Speaker 2>you get 100,</v>

1473

01:12:56.710 --> 01:13:01.480
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you get 60 videos in and don't even know if you don't even know if you're</v>

1476
01:13:01.481 --> 01:13:02.500

<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't let anybody fully it.</v>

1480
01:13:09.121 --> 01:13:10.740
<v Speaker 2>Most people do this</v>

1481
01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:14.093
<v Speaker 5>for the money.</v>

1482

<v Speaker 5>I certainly did.</v>

1484
01:13:17.730 --> 01:13:18.720
<v Speaker 5>Not to begin with,</v>

1485
01:13:18.810 --> 01:13:19.643
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

1496
01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:50.760
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1497
01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:51.930
<v Speaker 2>For years for me,</v>

1498
01:13:52.190 --> 01:13:54.090
<v Speaker 2>they were basically a staple and I put them in everything.</v>

<v Speaker 5>played it and</v>

1506
01:14:28.730 --> 01:14:32.070
<v Speaker 6>about a ps four just to play that stupid game and the only reason I'm going to.</v>

1507
01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:35.980
<v Speaker 6>The only reason I've kept the PS four is to play final fantasy seven remake</v>

1508
01:14:36.010 --> 01:14:37.830
<v Speaker 6>comes out and then I'm going to ditch the playstation</v>

<v Speaker 6>Well I guess since the 14th amendment.</v>

1620
01:23:08.741 --> 01:23:09.880
<v Speaker 6>The blackboard screen now?</v>

1621
01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:40.513
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1622
01:23:42.740 --> 01:23:44.290
<v Speaker 6>Fair to say burden of color.</v>

1623
01:23:57.910 --> 01:23:58.181
<v Speaker 6>Yo.</v>

1624
01:23:58.181 --> 01:24:01.150
<v Speaker 6>Why won't Jordan Peterson say he believes in God?</v>

1625
01:24:12.540 --> 01:24:14.060
<v Speaker 5>I think he talks about them enough.</v>

1626
01:24:16.950 --> 01:24:17.783
<v Speaker 5>I mean come on.</v>

1627
01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:20.330
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1628
01:24:20.330 --> 01:24:23.300
<v Speaker 6>he does these frigging biblical lectures.</v>

1629
01:24:27.170 --> 01:24:28.460
<v Speaker 6>I don't have to ask somebody.</v>

1630
01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:31.070
<v Speaker 5>Do you believe in God?</v>

1631
01:24:32.630 --> 01:24:33.463
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1632
01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:34.461
<v Speaker 6>I could care less.</v>

1633
01:24:34.461 --> 01:24:35.300
<v Speaker 6>What your beliefs are</v>

1634
01:24:42.700 --> 01:24:43.870
<v Speaker 6>it just get back to real talk.</v>

1635
01:24:43.871 --> 01:24:44.191
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>

1636
01:24:44.191 --> 01:24:44.590
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

1637
01:24:44.590 --> 01:24:45.423
<v Speaker 6>Oh I'm sorry.</v>

1638
01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:45.970
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1639
01:24:45.970 --> 01:24:46.803
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1640
01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:47.993
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1641
01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:53.280
<v Speaker 6>I was seeing a Owen Owen Benjamin's livestream</v>

1642
01:24:54.860 --> 01:24:55.201
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

1643
01:24:55.201 --> 01:24:57.440
<v Speaker 5>they bring on,</v>

1644
01:24:57.450 --> 01:24:59.760
<v Speaker 5>brings it up quite a bit.</v>

1645
01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:01.253
<v Speaker 5>The</v>

1646
01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:04.520
<v Speaker 5>thing with a.</v>

1647
01:25:05.620 --> 01:25:07.480
<v Speaker 6>Why would he answer a simple question?</v>

1648
01:25:09.510 --> 01:25:12.270
<v Speaker 6>I mean he tells you because he doesn't want to be reduced to a soundbite.</v>

1649
01:25:14.370 --> 01:25:15.031
<v Speaker 6>And the thing is,</v>

1650
01:25:15.031 --> 01:25:15.601
<v Speaker 6>in his lecture,</v>

1651
01:25:15.601 --> 01:25:19.080
<v Speaker 6>nobody's asking him questions and his two hour long lectures,</v>

1652
01:25:19.530 --> 01:25:24.530
<v Speaker 6>nobody's asking him questions if people continuously grinded him,</v>

1653
01:25:25.830 --> 01:25:29.640
<v Speaker 6>if everybody in a q and a period just got together and said,</v>

1654
01:25:29.641 --> 01:25:29.821
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

1655
01:25:29.821 --> 01:25:32.370
<v Speaker 6>we're just gonna keep asking him the same question over and over,</v>

1656
01:25:32.770 --> 01:25:32.970
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1657
01:25:32.970 --> 01:25:34.740
<v Speaker 6>you might get some more information out of him,</v>

1658
01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:35.753
<v Speaker 6>but</v>

1659
01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:47.060
<v Speaker 6>it's fine with me.</v>

1660
01:25:47.061 --> 01:25:48.920
<v Speaker 6>I don't expect a bunch of</v>

1661
01:25:50.900 --> 01:25:52.550
<v Speaker 6>new information to come out of him.</v>

1662
01:26:03.690 --> 01:26:04.470
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1663
01:26:04.470 --> 01:26:06.210
<v Speaker 4>what I found most interesting</v>

1664
01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:13.400
<v Speaker 4>was that he was putting biblical stories into perspective to the point where</v>

1665
01:26:15.060 --> 01:26:16.260
<v Speaker 4>a mechanic friend of mine,</v>

1666
01:26:16.261 --> 01:26:17.940
<v Speaker 4>who I had come out and do the struts,</v>

1667
01:26:18.030 --> 01:26:20.730
<v Speaker 4>the rear struts on my car,</v>

1668
01:26:21.540 --> 01:26:21.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1669
01:26:21.900 --> 01:26:26.070
<v Speaker 4>he goes to ease really religious guy and we're sitting down and I was talking</v>

1670
01:26:26.071 --> 01:26:26.904
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>

1671
01:26:27.420 --> 01:26:27.691
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1672
01:26:27.691 --> 01:26:27.991
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1673
01:26:27.991 --> 01:26:29.040
<v Speaker 4>I do this thing on youtube.</v>

1674
01:26:29.041 --> 01:26:29.731
<v Speaker 4>I cut clips.</v>

1675
01:26:29.731 --> 01:26:29.971
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

1676
01:26:29.971 --> 01:26:30.301
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

1677
01:26:30.301 --> 01:26:30.661
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1678
01:26:30.661 --> 01:26:30.781
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1679
01:26:30.781 --> 01:26:30.991
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1680
01:26:30.991 --> 01:26:31.824
<v Speaker 4>what do you do?</v>

1681
01:26:32.430 --> 01:26:33.700
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>

1682
01:26:33.740 --> 01:26:33.911
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1683
01:26:33.911 --> 01:26:34.890
<v Speaker 4>well there's this,</v>

1684
01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:39.920
<v Speaker 4>a clinical psychologist out of Toronto University professor.</v>

1685
01:26:41.370 --> 01:26:42.960
<v Speaker 4>He ran a private practice,</v>

1686
01:26:42.990 --> 01:26:43.801
<v Speaker 4>all this Yada,</v>

1687
01:26:43.801 --> 01:26:43.981
<v Speaker 4>Yada,</v>

1688
01:26:43.981 --> 01:26:44.600
<v Speaker 4>Yada.</v>

1689
01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:45.450
<v Speaker 4>I still talking about the,</v>

1690
01:26:45.451 --> 01:26:46.650
<v Speaker 4>a biblical lectures.</v>

1691
01:26:46.651 --> 01:26:47.484
<v Speaker 4>So I start,</v>

1692
01:26:48.410 --> 01:26:49.243
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1693
01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:54.000
<v Speaker 6>so I started telling him about the,</v>

1694
01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:02.290
<v Speaker 6>I'm having trouble remembering it now.</v>

1695
01:27:05.070 --> 01:27:05.903
<v Speaker 4>I think</v>

1696
01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:07.233
<v Speaker 6>with Jacob,</v>

1697
01:27:07.300 --> 01:27:08.470
<v Speaker 6>you had the idea of</v>

1698
01:27:10.260 --> 01:27:11.093
<v Speaker 4>like a,</v>

1699
01:27:12.570 --> 01:27:15.060
<v Speaker 6>the idea of permanence and the plate placing,</v>

1700
01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:22.050
<v Speaker 6>placing something down and basically centering around that one thing.</v>

1701
01:27:23.150 --> 01:27:23.983
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1702
01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:29.910
<v Speaker 6>I'm terrible at being able to explain things but not with John Height that would</v>

1703
01:27:29.911 --> 01:27:30.960
<v Speaker 6>be like circling,</v>

1704
01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:31.801
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1705
01:27:31.801 --> 01:27:36.801
<v Speaker 6>the one thing being able to get around this one state of permanence,</v>

1706
01:27:39.050 --> 01:27:39.990
<v Speaker 6>state of permanence,</v>

1707
01:27:39.991 --> 01:27:41.850
<v Speaker 6>this object permanence,</v>

1708
01:27:42.260 --> 01:27:42.660
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1709
01:27:42.660 --> 01:27:47.660
<v Speaker 6>it could probably be anything in eminent inanimate object or a person that's</v>

1710
01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:51.270
<v Speaker 6>probably what people do with clergy,</v>

1711
01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:53.340
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

1712
01:27:53.340 --> 01:27:53.581
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1713
01:27:53.581 --> 01:27:56.580
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot of benefits I think to,</v>

1714
01:27:56.581 --> 01:27:57.414
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1715
01:27:57.810 --> 01:27:59.400
<v Speaker 6>to Jordan Peterson's lectures.</v>

1716
01:27:59.401 --> 01:28:00.520
<v Speaker 6>And um,</v>

1717
01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:05.550
<v Speaker 6>one thing that I've found interesting was Fox day mentioned that,</v>

1718
01:28:06.270 --> 01:28:06.481
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

1719
01:28:06.481 --> 01:28:06.721
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1720
01:28:06.721 --> 01:28:08.100
<v Speaker 6>if you listen to Jordan Peterson,</v>

1721
01:28:08.101 --> 01:28:11.820
<v Speaker 6>then you're probably already pretty messed up already and there's probably</v>

1722
01:28:11.821 --> 01:28:12.720
<v Speaker 6>something wrong with you.</v>

1723
01:28:13.110 --> 01:28:13.261
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1724
01:28:13.261 --> 01:28:14.460
<v Speaker 6>I was listening to his,</v>

1725
01:28:15.130 --> 01:28:15.963
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1726
01:28:16.870 --> 01:28:20.740
<v Speaker 6>to his lectures and they seemed pretty interesting,</v>

1727
01:28:20.741 --> 01:28:20.951
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1728
01:28:20.951 --> 01:28:24.130
<v Speaker 6>he was putting a different perspective</v>

1729
01:28:25.270 --> 01:28:26.103
<v Speaker 4>on</v>

1730
01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:29.760
<v Speaker 6>stories and</v>

1731
01:28:32.410 --> 01:28:33.850
<v Speaker 6>I just don't think that's the case.</v>

1732
01:28:33.910 --> 01:28:34.121
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1733
01:28:34.121 --> 01:28:35.140
<v Speaker 6>I worked in a Woodshop,</v>

1734
01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:39.970
<v Speaker 6>I worked in a cabinet shop where I would put furniture together,</v>

1735
01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:45.640
<v Speaker 6>either I worked in tandem with people or I worked by myself and I mean this is a</v>

1736
01:28:45.641 --> 01:28:47.140
<v Speaker 6>high end accustomed wood shop,</v>

1737
01:28:47.141 --> 01:28:47.321
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1738
01:28:47.321 --> 01:28:49.990
<v Speaker 6>doing $60,000 to a million dollar houses.</v>

1739
01:28:50.310 --> 01:28:51.143
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1740
01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:52.270
<v Speaker 6>and I basically,</v>

1741
01:28:52.271 --> 01:28:52.780
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1742
01:28:52.780 --> 01:28:53.561
<v Speaker 6>in the beginning of the day,</v>

1743
01:28:53.561 --> 01:28:54.590
<v Speaker 6>you just get a clipboard,</v>

1744
01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:57.310
<v Speaker 6>fair out what you're going to do and you start doing it.</v>

1745
01:28:57.790 --> 01:29:01.180
<v Speaker 6>So I would put on headphones and just listen.</v>

1746
01:29:02.550 --> 01:29:04.290
<v Speaker 2>And I found Peterson and I was like,</v>

1747
01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:04.531
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1748
01:29:04.531 --> 01:29:04.951
<v Speaker 2>hell yeah,</v>

1749
01:29:04.951 --> 01:29:05.810
<v Speaker 2>I'll listen to some of these.</v>

1750
01:29:05.870 --> 01:29:06.390
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1751
01:29:06.390 --> 01:29:06.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1752
01:29:06.620 --> 01:29:08.330
<v Speaker 2>he uh,</v>

1753
01:29:08.700 --> 01:29:09.780
<v Speaker 2>through him I,</v>

1754
01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:10.981
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1755
01:29:10.981 --> 01:29:15.981
<v Speaker 2>I knew about but didn't know the extent to which it would be interesting,</v>

1756
01:29:17.130 --> 01:29:18.450
<v Speaker 2>the Gulag archipelago.</v>

1757
01:29:18.451 --> 01:29:23.160
<v Speaker 2>So I listened to probably five or six hours of that and Holy Shit.</v>

1758
01:29:23.161 --> 01:29:23.561
<v Speaker 2>Like when,</v>

1759
01:29:23.561 --> 01:29:24.870
<v Speaker 2>when they start talking about,</v>

1760
01:29:25.250 --> 01:29:25.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1761
01:29:25.830 --> 01:29:30.300
<v Speaker 2>the torture that the soldiers would engage in with people basically setting you</v>

1762
01:29:30.301 --> 01:29:32.460
<v Speaker 2>up on a bench and not letting you go to sleep.</v>

1763
01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:33.993
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1764
01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:34.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1765
01:29:34.980 --> 01:29:38.250
<v Speaker 2>kicking dudes in the balls over and over.</v>

1766
01:29:38.251 --> 01:29:39.850
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1767
01:29:40.350 --> 01:29:40.981
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

1768
01:29:40.981 --> 01:29:44.280
<v Speaker 2>like it gets really graphic and specific that book.</v>

1769
01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:46.193
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1770
01:29:48.690 --> 01:29:49.840
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1771
01:29:50.630 --> 01:29:51.463
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1772
01:29:52.550 --> 01:29:55.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that I had ever read any Dostoevsky.</v>

1773
01:29:57.030 --> 01:30:00.120
<v Speaker 2>I haven't finished any dust he asked me,</v>

1774
01:30:00.121 --> 01:30:04.380
<v Speaker 2>but I started to read crime and punishment and</v>

1775
01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:06.780
<v Speaker 2>something else.</v>

1776
01:30:08.790 --> 01:30:09.623
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>

1777
01:30:10.740 --> 01:30:11.573
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1778
01:30:15.220 --> 01:30:16.030
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1779
01:30:16.030 --> 01:30:16.361
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1780
01:30:16.361 --> 01:30:17.194
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1781
01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:19.810
<v Speaker 2>what vox is biggest issue is that,</v>

1782
01:30:20.450 --> 01:30:20.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1783
01:30:20.710 --> 01:30:22.500
<v Speaker 2>he's Devoxx.</v>

1784
01:30:22.660 --> 01:30:24.190
<v Speaker 2>He seems to be taking away</v>

1785
01:30:26.710 --> 01:30:27.910
<v Speaker 2>western men</v>

1786
01:30:29.670 --> 01:30:30.503
<v Speaker 5>from</v>

1787
01:30:36.270 --> 01:30:37.230
<v Speaker 2>wanting to</v>

1788
01:30:39.390 --> 01:30:42.960
<v Speaker 2>group up to be able to fight the migrant crisis.</v>

1789
01:30:42.961 --> 01:30:44.130
<v Speaker 2>That and that,</v>

1790
01:30:44.370 --> 01:30:44.581
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1791
01:30:44.581 --> 01:30:45.720
<v Speaker 2>vox would say that,</v>

1792
01:30:47.500 --> 01:30:47.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1793
01:30:47.970 --> 01:30:50.100
<v Speaker 2>he's not an intellectual.</v>

1794
01:31:00.590 --> 01:31:00.750
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1795
01:31:00.750 --> 01:31:04.210
<v Speaker 2>who is the most interesting intellectual use subscribe to.</v>

1796
01:31:10.390 --> 01:31:11.223
<v Speaker 5>I Dunno,</v>

1797
01:31:13.980 --> 01:31:15.450
<v Speaker 2>I like Ralph Nader a lot.</v>

1798
01:31:15.930 --> 01:31:20.100
<v Speaker 2>I like his idea that the way that you're going to change things in the states is</v>

1799
01:31:20.101 --> 01:31:21.060
<v Speaker 2>through congress.</v>

1800
01:31:22.070 --> 01:31:22.903
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1801
01:31:25.060 --> 01:31:25.301
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1802
01:31:25.301 --> 01:31:28.990
<v Speaker 2>unless you have people that get out in the street basically,</v>

1803
01:31:28.991 --> 01:31:31.270
<v Speaker 2>if you can overtake Congress,</v>

1804
01:31:32.290 --> 01:31:32.920
<v Speaker 2>then you can,</v>

1805
01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:33.753
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1806
01:31:34.120 --> 01:31:35.770
<v Speaker 2>you can get work done,</v>

1807
01:31:38.620 --> 01:31:39.460
<v Speaker 2>good things done.</v>

1808
01:31:40.360 --> 01:31:40.571
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1809
01:31:40.571 --> 01:31:41.470
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that,</v>

1810
01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:43.713
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

1811
01:31:44.850 --> 01:31:45.311
<v Speaker 2>the Aaron,</v>

1812
01:31:45.311 --> 01:31:48.430
<v Speaker 2>what the clean air and Water Act,</v>

1813
01:31:49.540 --> 01:31:50.373
<v Speaker 2>Osha</v>

1814
01:31:52.050 --> 01:31:55.660
<v Speaker 2>and I think seat belts were laws that were drafted by Ralph Nader.</v>

1815
01:32:01.640 --> 01:32:02.473
<v Speaker 5>That's</v>

1816
01:32:05.060 --> 01:32:05.893
<v Speaker 5>pretty interesting.</v>

1817
01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:12.300
<v Speaker 5>I don't know Chris Hedges.</v>

1818
01:32:14.110 --> 01:32:15.040
<v Speaker 5>It's interesting to.</v>

1819
01:32:17.100 --> 01:32:17.251
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1820
01:32:17.251 --> 01:32:18.720
<v Speaker 6>he's definitely a darker.</v>

1821
01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:21.570
<v Speaker 6>He's got to be way darker than most people.</v>

1822
01:32:21.571 --> 01:32:21.841
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1823
01:32:21.841 --> 01:32:25.500
<v Speaker 6>he was a war correspondent who's was captured by the Iraqi,</v>

1824
01:32:25.950 --> 01:32:27.750
<v Speaker 6>I think they were called the Republican Guard,</v>

1825
01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:32.010
<v Speaker 6>believe he thought he said he's going to be murdered,</v>

1826
01:32:33.090 --> 01:32:34.590
<v Speaker 6>but he ended up being turned over.</v>

1827
01:32:37.300 --> 01:32:40.480
<v Speaker 6>He's been in so many different war torn environments.</v>

1828
01:32:42.320 --> 01:32:42.620
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1829
01:32:42.620 --> 01:32:44.510
<v Speaker 6>Peterson can be dark and he's,</v>

1830
01:32:44.570 --> 01:32:44.841
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1831
01:32:44.841 --> 01:32:45.320
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>

1832
01:32:45.320 --> 01:32:47.450
<v Speaker 6>he recommends reading a lot of dark literature,</v>

1833
01:32:47.451 --> 01:32:48.290
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>

1834
01:32:48.530 --> 01:32:52.160
<v Speaker 6>Chris hedges is a dark person.</v>

1835
01:32:52.790 --> 01:32:53.623
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>

1836
01:32:53.900 --> 01:32:54.260
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1837
01:32:54.260 --> 01:32:55.280
<v Speaker 6>you got people like,</v>

1838
01:32:57.780 --> 01:32:58.613
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1839
01:32:58.620 --> 01:33:02.670
<v Speaker 6>Jocko willink and other people who are trained in the military,</v>

1840
01:33:03.590 --> 01:33:04.423
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

1841
01:33:06.460 --> 01:33:06.850
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1842
01:33:06.850 --> 01:33:08.980
<v Speaker 6>hedges is a lot closer to what,</v>

1843
01:33:09.430 --> 01:33:12.760
<v Speaker 6>at least probably in the beginning of his career as being a bureau chief is a</v>

1844
01:33:12.761 --> 01:33:16.060
<v Speaker 6>lot closer to what a US citizen</v>

1845
01:33:18.630 --> 01:33:23.630
<v Speaker 6>isn't that close to how US citizen would react if I'm there to see war.</v>

1846
01:33:25.170 --> 01:33:26.910
<v Speaker 6>Can you recommend some dark literature?</v>

1847
01:33:33.180 --> 01:33:33.391
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1848
01:33:33.391 --> 01:33:33.960
<v Speaker 6>go read,</v>

1849
01:33:33.960 --> 01:33:35.430
<v Speaker 6>go read the Gulag archipelago.</v>

1850
01:33:35.790 --> 01:33:37.590
<v Speaker 6>If you want to feel sick to your stomach,</v>

1851
01:33:40.410 --> 01:33:41.243
<v Speaker 6>maybe you won't be.</v>

1852
01:33:43.570 --> 01:33:47.250
<v Speaker 6>I probably felt sick to my stomach because I was listening for five hours one</v>

1853
01:33:47.251 --> 01:33:50.370
<v Speaker 6>day I was ripping stuff through a table saw</v>

1854
01:33:53.010 --> 01:33:58.010
<v Speaker 6>probably for three hours of that day building face frames for cabinets and it</v>

1855
01:33:59.221 --> 01:33:59.730
<v Speaker 6>just,</v>

1856
01:33:59.730 --> 01:34:04.260
<v Speaker 6>it just kept going on and on about the specifics of torture</v>

1857
01:34:07.070 --> 01:34:07.940
<v Speaker 6>in eastern Europe.</v>

1858
01:34:28.070 --> 01:34:28.903
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1859
01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:48.993
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

1860
01:34:49.330 --> 01:34:50.163
<v Speaker 6>Well</v>

1861
01:34:54.270 --> 01:34:55.440
<v Speaker 6>I'm kind of interested.</v>

1862
01:34:55.650 --> 01:34:56.930
<v Speaker 6>They have the audiobook for dog.</v>

1863
01:34:57.080 --> 01:34:59.030
<v Speaker 6>Is it unabridged?</v>

1864
01:34:59.150 --> 01:34:59.361
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1865
01:34:59.361 --> 01:35:02.810
<v Speaker 6>Cause that's the thing is you got to read the unabridged version,</v>

1866
01:35:02.811 --> 01:35:03.320
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1867
01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:05.210
<v Speaker 6>You get to read every single word of</v>

1868
01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:09.600
<v Speaker 6>social needs in this work.</v>

1869
01:35:10.740 --> 01:35:10.981
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1870
01:35:10.981 --> 01:35:12.810
<v Speaker 6>I've thought of the perfect screenplay,</v>

1871
01:35:14.130 --> 01:35:14.963
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1872
01:35:15.100 --> 01:35:15.450
<v Speaker 6>ice,</v>

1873
01:35:15.450 --> 01:35:16.440
<v Speaker 6>I call it perfect,</v>

1874
01:35:16.441 --> 01:35:21.441
<v Speaker 6>but basically would open up with social since Harvard speech basically talking</v>

1875
01:35:22.501 --> 01:35:25.330
<v Speaker 6>to the individuals and then slowly it would like,</v>

1876
01:35:26.730 --> 01:35:29.470
<v Speaker 6>like transition to social needs and being in a cell</v>

1877
01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:34.490
<v Speaker 6>and it would basically the story,</v>

1878
01:35:34.850 --> 01:35:36.890
<v Speaker 6>the film would revolve around,</v>

1879
01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:38.750
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1880
01:35:38.750 --> 01:35:41.240
<v Speaker 6>different people who had told him different stories.</v>

1881
01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:43.400
<v Speaker 6>I don't know that much about social needs in our,</v>

1882
01:35:43.401 --> 01:35:48.030
<v Speaker 6>how he collected a lot of those stories for that,</v>

1883
01:35:48.670 --> 01:35:50.030
<v Speaker 6>a piece of work.</v>

1884
01:35:50.060 --> 01:35:52.430
<v Speaker 6>But I think it would be a really interesting movie.</v>

1885
01:35:53.270 --> 01:35:56.180
<v Speaker 6>It could be really interesting film if created correctly,</v>

1886
01:35:57.830 --> 01:35:58.790
<v Speaker 6>probably better than</v>

1887
01:36:06.780 --> 01:36:07.613
<v Speaker 6>it could be on the,</v>

1888
01:36:09.150 --> 01:36:10.860
<v Speaker 6>it could be in the realm of</v>

1889
01:36:13.070 --> 01:36:15.540
<v Speaker 6>like a Schindler's list.</v>

1890
01:36:19.150 --> 01:36:22.800
<v Speaker 6>So if you can't use Liam Neeson line anymore because of his,</v>

1891
01:36:22.801 --> 01:36:23.634
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1892
01:36:25.210 --> 01:36:25.540
<v Speaker 6>God,</v>

1893
01:36:25.540 --> 01:36:29.590
<v Speaker 6>Hollywood's obsession with him and taken to like everything has been reduced to</v>

1894
01:36:29.591 --> 01:36:29.771
<v Speaker 6>a,</v>

1895
01:36:29.771 --> 01:36:30.130
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1896
01:36:30.130 --> 01:36:30.963
<v Speaker 6>to a meme.</v>

1897
01:36:32.020 --> 01:36:33.390
<v Speaker 6>And his is the taken meme,</v>

1898
01:36:33.640 --> 01:36:34.473
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1899
01:36:37.150 --> 01:36:39.940
<v Speaker 6>So you'd have to find somebody else to play social needs,</v>

1900
01:36:40.500 --> 01:36:41.380
<v Speaker 6>but it would be a good,</v>

1901
01:36:42.130 --> 01:36:42.701
<v Speaker 6>good story.</v>

1902
01:36:42.701 --> 01:36:43.534
<v Speaker 6>Good film.</v>

1903
01:36:46.310 --> 01:36:47.500
<v Speaker 6>Could be a Hollywood film too.</v>

1904
01:36:57.840 --> 01:36:58.710
<v Speaker 6>That was my thought.</v>

1905
01:36:58.980 --> 01:37:00.420
<v Speaker 6>I've done some videography work.</v>

1906
01:37:01.180 --> 01:37:05.310
<v Speaker 6>I do some videography work now for company out of Rochester,</v>

1907
01:37:05.311 --> 01:37:06.144
<v Speaker 6>New York,</v>

1908
01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:07.433
<v Speaker 6>CGI.</v>

1909
01:37:08.540 --> 01:37:12.680
<v Speaker 6>Basically I just shoot the raw content and send it off and they.</v>

1910
01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.000
<v Speaker 6>They edited down.</v>

1911
01:37:17.030 --> 01:37:18.200
<v Speaker 6>I do that in the carpentry.</v>

1912
01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:28.753
<v Speaker 6>What else?</v>

1913
01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:32.850
<v Speaker 6>Soon as they listened to jpl,</v>

1914
01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:35.560
<v Speaker 6>the symbols and he talks about no jumps at me when I watch movies.</v>

1915
01:37:38.870 --> 01:37:39.703
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

1916
01:37:57.780 --> 01:37:58.141
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>

1917
01:37:58.141 --> 01:38:00.090
<v Speaker 6>I know he does a lot about Harry potter.</v>

1918
01:38:01.060 --> 01:38:02.050
<v Speaker 5>Remember the Lion King?</v>

1919
01:38:03.470 --> 01:38:04.303
<v Speaker 5>Harry Potter.</v>

1920
01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:06.153
<v Speaker 5>Pinocchio.</v>

1921
01:38:17.830 --> 01:38:20.500
<v Speaker 6>The snake stands for evil.</v>

1922
01:38:26.530 --> 01:38:29.050
<v Speaker 6>I thought that this snake.</v>

1923
01:38:31.210 --> 01:38:31.820
<v Speaker 6>Awesome.</v>

1924
01:38:31.820 --> 01:38:31.960
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1925
01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:32.793
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

1926
01:38:36.940 --> 01:38:39.520
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if that's the only thing that the snake symbolizes,</v>

1927
01:38:41.660 --> 01:38:46.660
<v Speaker 6>but that which man the predators are that which man has to pay attention to.</v>

1928
01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:49.460
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1929
01:38:49.460 --> 01:38:49.790
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

1930
01:38:49.790 --> 01:38:49.971
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

1931
01:38:49.971 --> 01:38:50.430
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

1932
01:38:50.430 --> 01:38:51.263
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

1933
01:39:00.350 --> 01:39:02.240
<v Speaker 6>Despite what everybody else has said,</v>

1934
01:39:04.550 --> 01:39:06.080
<v Speaker 6>despite what everybody else said,</v>

1935
01:39:06.081 --> 01:39:06.914
<v Speaker 6>I don't.</v>

1936
01:39:09.260 --> 01:39:10.040
<v Speaker 6>I think he was.</v>

1937
01:39:10.040 --> 01:39:13.310
<v Speaker 6>I think Peterson has been a net benefit.</v>

1938
01:39:15.590 --> 01:39:16.423
<v Speaker 5>Two people.</v>

1939
01:39:17.110 --> 01:39:17.943
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1940
01:39:18.080 --> 01:39:18.980
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what that means.</v>

1941
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:34.050
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

1942
01:39:34.050 --> 01:39:36.380
<v Speaker 6>It might also be that you just didn't look for symbolism.</v>

1943
01:39:37.290 --> 01:39:38.340
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1944
01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:47.833
<v Speaker 6>a director</v>

1945
01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:50.913
<v Speaker 5>director</v>

1946
01:39:53.210 --> 01:39:54.043
<v Speaker 5>will,</v>

1947
01:39:57.280 --> 01:39:59.890
<v Speaker 6>depending in which capacity the director is acting in,</v>

1948
01:39:59.891 --> 01:40:01.480
<v Speaker 6>but let's say somebody wrote a screenplay,</v>

1949
01:40:01.510 --> 01:40:06.510
<v Speaker 6>he'll go ahead and he'll take that screenplay and he'll pick out what he wants</v>

1950
01:40:08.111 --> 01:40:08.944
<v Speaker 6>to.</v>

1951
01:40:09.550 --> 01:40:10.720
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1952
01:40:13.350 --> 01:40:17.280
<v Speaker 6>he'll pick out exactly the symbolism that he wants to,</v>

1953
01:40:17.800 --> 01:40:18.633
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1954
01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:20.273
<v Speaker 6>highlight.</v>

1955
01:40:20.550 --> 01:40:21.940
<v Speaker 6>And if you read the reading,</v>

1956
01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:23.970
<v Speaker 6>but if you listen to the commentary of a movie,</v>

1957
01:40:23.971 --> 01:40:24.151
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1958
01:40:24.151 --> 01:40:26.490
<v Speaker 6>you can listen to a director talking about,</v>

1959
01:40:26.910 --> 01:40:27.181
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

1960
01:40:27.181 --> 01:40:28.230
<v Speaker 6>I love this this way,</v>

1961
01:40:28.231 --> 01:40:29.970
<v Speaker 6>and I framed this shot this way,</v>

1962
01:40:30.450 --> 01:40:30.730
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1963
01:40:30.730 --> 01:40:32.460
<v Speaker 6>and I let the flower,</v>

1964
01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:37.760
<v Speaker 6>I let the vas stay in the left part of the shot to symbolize the,</v>

1965
01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:39.060
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1966
01:40:39.060 --> 01:40:40.620
<v Speaker 6>person passed the.</v>

1967
01:40:44.590 --> 01:40:45.670
<v Speaker 6>When you hear these things,</v>

1968
01:40:45.671 --> 01:40:46.181
<v Speaker 6>you think like,</v>

1969
01:40:46.181 --> 01:40:49.690
<v Speaker 6>how the hell would I ever get that?</v>

1970
01:40:50.470 --> 01:40:54.010
<v Speaker 6>Why would I think that the light in the back being left on</v>

1971
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:57.130
<v Speaker 2>back there would mean something.</v>

1972
01:40:57.220 --> 01:40:58.053
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1973
01:40:58.690 --> 01:41:00.430
<v Speaker 2>And it could just be that they watched,</v>

1974
01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:02.380
<v Speaker 2>they watched these shots,</v>

1975
01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:04.091
<v Speaker 2>they see these,</v>

1976
01:41:04.091 --> 01:41:04.924
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1977
01:41:05.230 --> 01:41:07.000
<v Speaker 2>scenes afterward and they come up with it.</v>

1978
01:41:10.770 --> 01:41:12.810
<v Speaker 2>People love Peterson for his suggesting that,</v>

1979
01:41:13.110 --> 01:41:13.540
<v Speaker 2>Kevin,</v>

1980
01:41:13.540 --> 01:41:14.640
<v Speaker 2>I quit after winning.</v>

1981
01:41:15.180 --> 01:41:15.781
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

1982
01:41:15.781 --> 01:41:17.190
<v Speaker 2>I knew exactly what Peterson meant,</v>

1983
01:41:18.030 --> 01:41:18.301
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1984
01:41:18.301 --> 01:41:23.301
<v Speaker 2>Peterson's message has been consistently that sometimes it's better to go for</v>

1985
01:41:24.091 --> 01:41:29.091
<v Speaker 2>peace than it is to go for a war and as soon as I read that,</v>

1986
01:41:29.461 --> 01:41:30.390
<v Speaker 2>it took me less than,</v>

1987
01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:32.670
<v Speaker 2>less than 10 seconds.</v>

1988
01:41:32.671 --> 01:41:33.420
<v Speaker 2>And I went,</v>

1989
01:41:33.420 --> 01:41:33.541
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1990
01:41:33.541 --> 01:41:35.100
<v Speaker 2>that's the whole piece.</v>

1991
01:41:35.101 --> 01:41:38.970
<v Speaker 2>And then he said that he said it days later and I thought,</v>

1992
01:41:39.810 --> 01:41:40.111
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1993
01:41:40.111 --> 01:41:41.130
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>

1994
01:41:41.870 --> 01:41:43.020
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't really care.</v>

1995
01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:43.873
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1996
01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:47.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if Cavanaugh's is put in,</v>

1997
01:41:47.790 --> 01:41:48.623
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1998
01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:50.940
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm not for.</v>

1999
01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:56.640
<v Speaker 2>I've not been a part of the state,</v>

2000
01:41:56.641 --> 01:41:57.900
<v Speaker 2>so I'm not for this state.</v>

2001
01:41:58.260 --> 01:41:58.830
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2002
01:41:58.830 --> 01:42:00.150
<v Speaker 2>if I was in Kevin's shoes,</v>

2003
01:42:00.151 --> 01:42:00.751
<v Speaker 2>it'd be different.</v>

2004
01:42:00.751 --> 01:42:03.270
<v Speaker 2>Or if I was a person who</v>

2005
01:42:05.220 --> 01:42:06.060
<v Speaker 2>it would be different,</v>

2006
01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:07.073
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

2007
01:42:07.940 --> 01:42:08.773
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2008
01:42:09.660 --> 01:42:10.530
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

2009
01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:18.010
<v Speaker 2>That if I was part of like a bushes era,</v>

2010
01:42:18.520 --> 01:42:19.420
<v Speaker 2>if I was,</v>

2011
01:42:20.170 --> 01:42:25.170
<v Speaker 2>if I was one of the people involved in drafting the Patriot Act where Kevin,</v>

2012
01:42:27.161 --> 01:42:28.570
<v Speaker 2>I would go ahead and copyright it</v>

2013
01:42:29.580 --> 01:42:30.413
<v Speaker 5>into law.</v>

2014
01:42:33.410 --> 01:42:38.410
<v Speaker 2>See I the whole thing with Kevin or is everybody was watching the spectacle</v>

2015
01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:42.033
<v Speaker 5>and</v>

2016
01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:43.661
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2017
01:42:43.661 --> 01:42:44.590
<v Speaker 2>to me it's like</v>

2018
01:42:46.670 --> 01:42:48.700
<v Speaker 2>this is not what you should be paying attention to.</v>

2019
01:42:49.730 --> 01:42:50.630
<v Speaker 2>Who is Kevin on?</v>

2020
01:42:50.631 --> 01:42:51.650
<v Speaker 2>What did he vote on?</v>

2021
01:42:57.720 --> 01:42:57.901
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2022
01:42:57.901 --> 01:42:59.310
<v Speaker 2>you're just not going to get a.</v>

2023
01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:05.661
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2024
01:43:05.661 --> 01:43:07.190
<v Speaker 2>I think you should listen to everybody.</v>

2025
01:43:07.430 --> 01:43:07.910
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2026
01:43:07.910 --> 01:43:11.420
<v Speaker 2>I think I like Owen Benjamin and I think he should be.</v>

2027
01:43:13.100 --> 01:43:15.050
<v Speaker 2>I think everybody can have something.</v>

2028
01:43:16.610 --> 01:43:19.070
<v Speaker 2>Everybody can have something worse.</v>

2029
01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:20.833
<v Speaker 2>Communicating.</v>

2030
01:43:25.470 --> 01:43:25.950
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2031
01:43:25.950 --> 01:43:29.640
<v Speaker 2>Everybody has the potential to communicate something to a.</v>

2032
01:43:33.430 --> 01:43:34.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2033
01:43:34.210 --> 01:43:35.710
<v Speaker 2>Everybody has the potential to</v>

2034
01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:38.680
<v Speaker 2>something worth communicating.</v>

2035
01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:39.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2036
01:43:39.260 --> 01:43:40.093
<v Speaker 2>Constrict.</v>

2037
01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:41.153
<v Speaker 2>Just criticism,</v>

2038
01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:42.513
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2039
01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:48.600
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm totally for the idea that if you hate somebody though,</v>

2040
01:43:52.810 --> 01:43:53.581
<v Speaker 6>why don't you hate them?</v>

2041
01:43:53.581 --> 01:43:54.140
<v Speaker 6>But I get it.</v>

2042
01:43:54.140 --> 01:43:55.460
<v Speaker 6>I guess there's probably reasons,</v>

2043
01:43:55.730 --> 01:43:58.060
<v Speaker 6>but if you don't like somebody you should listen.</v>

2044
01:43:58.080 --> 01:43:59.270
<v Speaker 6>Especially to those people</v>

2045
01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:06.760
<v Speaker 6>because they're going to be the ones who may have a grain of truth that they're</v>

2046
01:44:08.961 --> 01:44:11.540
<v Speaker 6>willing to share with you.</v>

2047
01:44:11.810 --> 01:44:16.250
<v Speaker 6>Whereas I like Owen Benjamin on Jordan Peterson.</v>

2048
01:44:19.270 --> 01:44:20.440
<v Speaker 6>I like box day,</v>

2049
01:44:20.441 --> 01:44:21.730
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>

2050
01:44:21.731 --> 01:44:22.564
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>

2051
01:44:24.580 --> 01:44:26.680

2061
01:44:46.430 --> 01:44:49.280
<v Speaker 6>I didn't watch it from the beginning,</v>

2062
01:44:49.281 --> 01:44:52.160
<v Speaker 6>but in own Benjamin's livestream with Fox day,</v>

2063
01:44:53.270 --> 01:44:54.320
<v Speaker 6>he comes up to the own.</v>

2064
01:44:54.321 --> 01:44:55.130
<v Speaker 6>Ben's was like,</v>

<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

2066
01:44:55.401 --> 01:44:58.820
<v Speaker 6>didn't he do something with a agenda 21?</v>

2067
01:44:59.570 --> 01:45:00.740
<v Speaker 6>And Vox is like,</v>

2068
01:45:00.741 --> 01:45:01.131
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2069
01:45:01.131 --> 01:45:06.131
<v Speaker 6>it was a basically as far as I can understand what it was,</v>

2070
01:45:06.561 --> 01:45:08.690
<v Speaker 6>he was invited to,</v>

<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2072

<v Speaker 6>to participate in the.</v>

2073
01:45:14.570 --> 01:45:16.400
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if it was the writing of any type.</v>

2074
01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:19.010
<v Speaker 6>I believe it was in the drafting of a,</v>

2075
01:45:21.080 --> 01:45:22.370
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what you would consider it,</v>

2076
01:45:22.700 --> 01:45:27.050
<v Speaker 6>but Peterson even has peter even talks about it as being something where,</v>

2077
01:45:27.470 --> 01:45:27.710
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2078
01:45:27.710 --> 01:45:32.330
<v Speaker 6>he came into this and everybody's not predictions but there.</v>

2079
01:45:32.690 --> 01:45:33.523
<v Speaker 4>Uh</v>

01:45:34.940 --> 01:45:35.773
<v Speaker 4>Huh.</v>

2081
01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:39.851
<v Speaker 6>Estimates,</v>

2082
01:45:39.851 --> 01:45:40.360
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2083
01:45:40.360 --> 01:45:41.740
<v Speaker 6>I don't know their projections,</v>

2084
01:45:41.741 --> 01:45:45.340
<v Speaker 6>everybody's projections where I very dark,</v>

2085
01:45:45.490 --> 01:45:45.830
<v Speaker 6>you know.</v>

2086
01:45:45.830 --> 01:45:48.340
<v Speaker 6>And as far as what he said,</v>

2087
01:45:48.341 --> 01:45:49.510
<v Speaker 6>he came out and he said that it,</v>

2088
01:45:49.930 --> 01:45:50.650
<v Speaker 6>it was different.</v>

2089
01:45:50.650 --> 01:45:52.720
<v Speaker 6>Now vox probably read that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2247
01:52:09.381 --> 01:52:10.250
<v Speaker 2>because I think they were,</v>

2248
01:52:11.720 --> 01:52:15.260
<v Speaker 2>they were looking for a way to be able to make money.</v>

2249
01:52:15.261 --> 01:52:15.891
<v Speaker 2>And then of course,</v>

01:52:15.891 --> 01:52:16.071
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2251

2275
01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:18.940
<v Speaker 6>I didn't start clipping the content for the money when I started making quite a</v>

2276
01:53:18.941 --> 01:53:19.511
<v Speaker 6>bit of money.</v>

2281
01:53:27.750 --> 01:53:27.950
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2282
01:53:27.950 --> 01:53:31.150
<v Speaker 6>well I save for a long time for about six months.</v>

2283
01:53:31.900 --> 01:53:32.733
<v Speaker 6>I mean I didn't,</v>

2284
01:53:33.390 --> 01:53:36.110
<v Speaker 6>I mean I still clipping clips but you know,</v>

2285
01:53:36.160 --> 01:53:37.180
<v Speaker 6>when I realized that,</v>

2286
01:53:38.690 --> 01:53:39.523
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2287
01:53:40.900 --> 01:53:43.030
<v Speaker 6>that I could make money at it.</v>

2288
01:53:43.120 --> 01:53:43.953
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2289
01:53:44.970 --> 01:53:49.810
<v Speaker 6>I don't make any money on this channel now youtube is demonetized this channel.</v>

2290
01:53:50.690 --> 01:53:52.780
<v Speaker 6>I have a possibility of getting re monetized.</v>

2291
01:53:52.800 --> 01:53:53.633
<v Speaker 6>But</v>

2292
01:53:55.620 --> 01:53:56.453
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2293
01:53:56.850 --> 01:54:01.850
<v Speaker 6>there's no guarantee that a youtube is going to allow me to enter the Youtube</v>

2294
01:54:02.731 --> 01:54:03.810
<v Speaker 6>partnership program again.</v>

2295
01:54:13.140 --> 01:54:13.740
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2296
01:54:13.740 --> 01:54:14.573
<v Speaker 6>I dunno,</v>

2297
01:54:14.820 --> 01:54:16.050
<v Speaker 6>I don't really have that much.</v>

2298
01:54:18.350 --> 01:54:19.980
<v Speaker 6>The oppression will end one day.</v>

2299
01:54:20.860 --> 01:54:22.710
<v Speaker 6>I don't think that's true.</v>

2300
01:54:26.200 --> 01:54:27.760
<v Speaker 6>I don't think depression will ever end.</v>

2301
01:54:28.350 --> 01:54:30.190
<v Speaker 6>It will just be different forms of oppression.</v>

2302
01:54:30.250 --> 01:54:31.450
<v Speaker 6>You can't get rid of oppression</v>

2303
01:54:35.390 --> 01:54:36.223
<v Speaker 6>and if you get.</v>

2304
01:54:36.710 --> 01:54:39.140
<v Speaker 6>If you were to be able to get rid of oppression,</v>

2305
01:54:39.141 --> 01:54:43.880
<v Speaker 6>you wouldn't even recognize the paradigm that humans would live in because</v>

2306
01:54:43.881 --> 01:54:45.410
<v Speaker 6>humans wouldn't even resemble there.</v>

2307
01:54:45.411 --> 01:54:46.244
<v Speaker 6>Today.</v>

2308
01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:58.550
<v Speaker 6>The prophecy speaks of a new website that will from the ashes of Youtube.</v>

2309
01:54:59.810 --> 01:55:00.021
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2310
01:55:00.021 --> 01:55:00.854
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

2311
01:55:01.460 --> 01:55:03.620
<v Speaker 6>Google is like in bed with the state.</v>

2312
01:55:03.621 --> 01:55:04.454
<v Speaker 6>So</v>

2313
01:55:05.570 --> 01:55:07.850
<v Speaker 6>you think you that</v>

2314
01:55:10.730 --> 01:55:13.190
<v Speaker 6>you think that youtube is going to be replaced.</v>

2315
01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:15.313
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>

2316
01:55:20.330 --> 01:55:21.500
<v Speaker 6>You don't see that happening.</v>

2317
01:55:24.700 --> 01:55:28.150
<v Speaker 6>It's in bed with Google is in bed with the state.</v>

2318
01:55:30.410 --> 01:55:31.580
<v Speaker 6>If it keeps this up.</v>

2319
01:55:34.600 --> 01:55:35.440
<v Speaker 6>I don't think so.</v>

2320
01:55:35.470 --> 01:55:36.910
<v Speaker 6>They hold all the cards</v>

2321
01:55:38.620 --> 01:55:39.220
<v Speaker 6>now.</v>

2322
01:55:39.220 --> 01:55:41.370
<v Speaker 6>Now if they piss the state offer,</v>

2323
01:55:41.390 --> 01:55:42.760
<v Speaker 6>they piss politicians off.</v>

2324
01:55:42.880 --> 01:55:44.250
<v Speaker 6>I even know what that means.</v>

2325
01:55:45.180 --> 01:55:47.970
<v Speaker 2>If they piss people off the people that matter,</v>

2326
01:55:48.300 --> 01:55:51.630
<v Speaker 2>then you might have some antitrust issues</v>

2327
01:55:54.610 --> 01:55:56.680
<v Speaker 2>if we have weaponized autism on our side.</v>

2328
01:56:00.880 --> 01:56:01.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2329
01:56:01.390 --> 01:56:03.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's kind of what I'm doing right now.</v>

2330
01:56:03.020 --> 01:56:04.180
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of an autistic thing.</v>

2331
01:56:04.181 --> 01:56:05.260
<v Speaker 2>Sit in front of a camera.</v>

2332
01:56:12.250 --> 01:56:12.551
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2333
01:56:12.551 --> 01:56:13.060
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2334
01:56:13.060 --> 01:56:13.301
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2335
01:56:13.301 --> 01:56:14.710
<v Speaker 2>we're working towards a positive.</v>

2336
01:56:16.580 --> 01:56:18.170
<v Speaker 2>We are far beyond the antitrust.</v>

2337
01:56:23.370 --> 01:56:25.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't like the idea that Obama was a liberal,</v>

2338
01:56:25.700 --> 01:56:26.533
<v Speaker 2>cause he wasn't,</v>

2339
01:56:26.640 --> 01:56:27.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2340
01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:29.190
<v Speaker 2>Obama was as right wing as Bush.</v>

2341
01:56:29.910 --> 01:56:30.750
<v Speaker 2>Clinton was,</v>

2342
01:56:30.751 --> 01:56:32.880
<v Speaker 2>as right wing as Bush,</v>

2343
01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:34.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2344
01:56:34.080 --> 01:56:35.190
<v Speaker 2>you haven't had,</v>

2345
01:56:35.610 --> 01:56:40.610
<v Speaker 2>you haven't had liberal since Nixon and the only reason Nixon gave him the</v>

2346
01:56:41.371 --> 01:56:43.080
<v Speaker 2>liberal policies because he was afraid.</v>

2347
01:56:43.110 --> 01:56:43.230
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2348
01:56:43.230 --> 01:56:43.861
<v Speaker 2>that's the truth.</v>

2349
01:56:43.861 --> 01:56:48.861
<v Speaker 2>And I can tell you exactly why obamacare was Romney care and Romney care,</v>

2350
01:56:49.081 --> 01:56:50.190
<v Speaker 2>I believe was,</v>

2351
01:56:51.500 --> 01:56:52.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2352
01:56:52.220 --> 01:56:53.053
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

2353
01:56:53.310 --> 01:56:54.870
<v Speaker 2>Obama is a globalist Marxist.</v>

2354
01:56:55.200 --> 01:56:55.890
<v Speaker 2>See that?</v>

2355
01:56:55.890 --> 01:56:57.240
<v Speaker 2>You have to think about it differently.</v>

2356
01:56:57.510 --> 01:57:00.390
<v Speaker 2>That's not exactly true.</v>

2357
01:57:00.510 --> 01:57:01.110
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2358
01:57:01.110 --> 01:57:01.381
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2359
01:57:01.381 --> 01:57:01.561
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

2360
01:57:01.561 --> 01:57:01.910
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

2361
01:57:01.910 --> 01:57:03.450
<v Speaker 2>there is some truth to that.</v>

2362
01:57:03.510 --> 01:57:04.343
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

2363
01:57:06.620 --> 01:57:11.620
<v Speaker 2>Obama I believe really liked control and he liked being able to control</v>

2364
01:57:15.820 --> 01:57:18.140
<v Speaker 2>geopolitics and the TPP.</v>

2365
01:57:18.260 --> 01:57:19.250
<v Speaker 2>I believe</v>

2366
01:57:21.330 --> 01:57:24.810
<v Speaker 2>the TPP was meant to help cripple China.</v>

2367
01:57:26.070 --> 01:57:26.903
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2368
01:57:30.150 --> 01:57:32.250
<v Speaker 2>and we didn't go through with it.</v>

2369
01:57:32.251 --> 01:57:33.690
<v Speaker 2>Of course it's bad for America,</v>

2370
01:57:33.900 --> 01:57:34.733
<v Speaker 2>but it was supposed to be,</v>

2371
01:57:35.190 --> 01:57:36.840
<v Speaker 2>as far as I've read,</v>

2372
01:57:36.900 --> 01:57:39.540
<v Speaker 2>it's supposed to be very bad for China.</v>

2373
01:57:43.870 --> 01:57:46.450
<v Speaker 2>Control doesn't care about your idealisms.</v>

2374
01:57:51.510 --> 01:57:52.380
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

2375
01:57:52.381 --> 01:57:53.220
<v Speaker 2>a Bama liked,</v>

2376
01:57:55.890 --> 01:57:56.081
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2377
01:57:56.081 --> 01:57:56.914
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>

2378
01:57:57.100 --> 01:57:58.090
<v Speaker 2>he's a bad dude.</v>

2379
01:58:01.250 --> 01:58:02.630
<v Speaker 2>Obama sought to deconstruct,</v>

2380
01:58:02.690 --> 01:58:03.170
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

2381
01:58:03.170 --> 01:58:04.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't think Obama gave me shit.</v>

2382
01:58:05.180 --> 01:58:06.013
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2383
01:58:06.380 --> 01:58:09.470
<v Speaker 2>Obama was doing what was going to make him money just like Clinton.</v>

2384
01:58:10.160 --> 01:58:10.993
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

2385
01:58:12.050 --> 01:58:13.310
<v Speaker 2>You think those guys care,</v>

2386
01:58:13.370 --> 01:58:14.031
<v Speaker 2>you think they have?</v>

2387
01:58:14.031 --> 01:58:17.810
<v Speaker 2>I think they have some ideology.</v>

2388
01:58:18.860 --> 01:58:19.670
<v Speaker 2>Hell No.</v>

2389
01:58:19.670 --> 01:58:21.710
<v Speaker 2>You have to to get to where you are.</v>

2390
01:58:21.711 --> 01:58:26.711
<v Speaker 2>Then you have to kiss ass here and kiss ass there and you know and huddle up</v>

2391
01:58:27.111 --> 01:58:29.550
<v Speaker 2>here and huddle up there and you know,</v>

2392
01:58:29.620 --> 01:58:31.010
<v Speaker 2>you have to play the game.</v>

2393
01:58:31.011 --> 01:58:34.550
<v Speaker 2>You play the game and then once you're the lead chief</v>

2394
01:58:36.320 --> 01:58:41.320
<v Speaker 2>then it's just about now I can do favors for people that secure me in</v>

2395
01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:44.800
<v Speaker 6>the future because I've only got four to eight years here.</v>

2396
01:58:45.130 --> 01:58:48.370
<v Speaker 6>But once I'm out I don't want to ever have to work again.</v>

2397
01:58:48.371 --> 01:58:49.420
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to have to do anything.</v>

2398
01:58:49.421 --> 01:58:52.210
<v Speaker 6>Not that they would if they didn't cozy up to.</v>

2399
01:58:53.880 --> 01:58:54.900
<v Speaker 6>You have to be a lizard.</v>

2400
01:59:02.850 --> 01:59:05.310
<v Speaker 6>Obama's ideology is Satan and it's divas part.</v>

2401
01:59:05.340 --> 01:59:08.340
<v Speaker 6>He sold out the US like the last four presidents.</v>

2402
01:59:17.630 --> 01:59:19.580
<v Speaker 6>It goes back more than four.</v>

2403
01:59:20.390 --> 01:59:20.661
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2404
01:59:20.661 --> 01:59:20.810
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

2405
01:59:20.810 --> 01:59:25.640
<v Speaker 6>I certainly think that Reagan cutting the taxes on the wealthy was a terrible</v>

2406
01:59:25.641 --> 01:59:26.474
<v Speaker 6>idea.</v>

2407
01:59:28.500 --> 01:59:29.333
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2408
01:59:30.180 --> 01:59:35.010
<v Speaker 6>the idea that the super rich or anything like</v>

2409
01:59:36.570 --> 01:59:37.420
<v Speaker 6>you and I are,</v>

2410
01:59:37.590 --> 01:59:38.423
<v Speaker 6>are not true.</v>

2411
01:59:38.640 --> 01:59:38.881
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2412
01:59:38.881 --> 01:59:39.714
<v Speaker 6>first off,</v>

2413
01:59:39.870 --> 01:59:44.670
<v Speaker 6>a lot of very wealthy people get to where they're at by working extremely hard.</v>

2414
01:59:45.210 --> 01:59:45.840
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2415
01:59:45.840 --> 01:59:50.700
<v Speaker 6>So they're very driven and that already disqualifies them from being like most</v>

2416
01:59:50.701 --> 01:59:51.534
<v Speaker 6>people.</v>

2417
02:00:02.910 --> 02:00:03.121
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

2418
02:00:03.121 --> 02:00:04.470
<v Speaker 6>Reagan had a lot of things that weren't</v>

2419
02:00:06.890 --> 02:00:07.723
<v Speaker 1>very good.</v>

2420
02:00:21.070 --> 02:00:22.240
<v Speaker 6>No wealthy people aren't bad.</v>

2421
02:00:30.550 --> 02:00:31.383
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2422
02:00:39.580 --> 02:00:39.940
<v Speaker 6>Can you.</v>

2423
02:00:39.940 --> 02:00:41.800
<v Speaker 6>The bleed is going on for two hours.</v>

2424
02:00:53.830 --> 02:00:57.010
<v Speaker 6>Is it true that people who tend to be assholes become either criminals or</v>

2425
02:00:57.011 --> 02:00:57.844
<v Speaker 6>politicians?</v>

2426
02:00:58.320 --> 02:00:59.170
<v Speaker 6>I don't know about that,</v>

2427
02:00:59.171 --> 02:01:01.480
<v Speaker 6>but if the person's an asshole and they just stay in ass</v>

2428
02:01:04.100 --> 02:01:07.070
<v Speaker 6>and what may be an asshole to somebody else may not be to other people.</v>

2429
02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:08.851
<v Speaker 6>Like if you're a disc,</v>

2430
02:01:08.851 --> 02:01:10.340
<v Speaker 6>a disagreeable person,</v>

2431
02:01:10.341 --> 02:01:10.491
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2432
02:01:10.491 --> 02:01:11.930
<v Speaker 6>maybe people see that as</v>

2433
02:01:14.090 --> 02:01:15.830
<v Speaker 6>having asshole tendencies.</v>

2434
02:01:20.920 --> 02:01:21.910
<v Speaker 6>What is wealth?</v>

2435
02:01:26.100 --> 02:01:28.350
<v Speaker 6>Wealth is money assets</v>

2436
02:01:31.730 --> 02:01:33.500
<v Speaker 6>that span over generations.</v>

2437
02:01:40.670 --> 02:01:44.090
<v Speaker 6>I mean if you have enough wealth and it's the first generation of it,</v>

2438
02:01:44.091 --> 02:01:44.690
<v Speaker 6>then that's.</v>

2439
02:01:44.690 --> 02:01:46.700
<v Speaker 6>You can still at wealth and being the first generation.</v>

2440
02:02:07.950 --> 02:02:09.990
<v Speaker 6>Do you have thoughts on psychedelics?</v>

2441
02:02:13.810 --> 02:02:14.643
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

2442
02:02:16.780 --> 02:02:18.310
<v Speaker 6>like what Jonathan?</v>

2443
02:02:38.830 --> 02:02:39.071
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2444
02:02:39.071 --> 02:02:44.071
<v Speaker 6>I think cannabis can make cancer cells destroy themselves in mice.</v>

2445
02:02:49.900 --> 02:02:50.733
<v Speaker 6>I think high,</v>

2446
02:02:51.490 --> 02:02:53.070
<v Speaker 6>high doses of A.</v>

2447
02:02:53.170 --> 02:02:58.170
<v Speaker 6>I think there's a medical article of a single girl being,</v>

2448
02:02:59.290 --> 02:03:00.123
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2449
02:03:01.380 --> 02:03:04.630
<v Speaker 6>that when there were low doses of thc and cannabinoids,</v>

2450
02:03:05.570 --> 02:03:08.980
<v Speaker 6>there was no effect and actually exacerbates,</v>

2451
02:03:09.070 --> 02:03:11.290
<v Speaker 6>exacerbated the cancer cells,</v>

2452
02:03:11.590 --> 02:03:15.820
<v Speaker 6>but when she started taking extremely high doses that her cancer cells,</v>

2453
02:03:15.950 --> 02:03:16.783
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2454
02:03:18.760 --> 02:03:19.720
<v Speaker 6>pretty much wiped out.</v>

2455
02:03:20.500 --> 02:03:21.110
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>

2456
02:03:21.110 --> 02:03:21.943
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2457
02:03:23.690 --> 02:03:25.520
<v Speaker 6>I don't know how much further research has been done.</v>

2458
02:04:02.950 --> 02:04:03.783
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

2459
02:04:10.270 --> 02:04:11.103
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2460
02:04:19.690 --> 02:04:20.130
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>

2461
02:04:20.130 --> 02:04:21.060
<v Speaker 6>I don't think so.</v>

2462
02:04:21.160 --> 02:04:21.760
<v Speaker 6>That's true.</v>

2463
02:04:21.760 --> 02:04:22.211
<v Speaker 6>Chris.</v>

2464
02:04:22.211 --> 02:04:23.200
<v Speaker 6>I think that's a good general.</v>

2465
02:04:23.201 --> 02:04:24.034
<v Speaker 6>I think that's.</v>

2466
02:04:24.670 --> 02:04:26.080
<v Speaker 6>Well the did the generalization.</v>

2467
02:04:26.081 --> 02:04:26.914
<v Speaker 6>I think it's true,</v>

2468
02:04:27.820 --> 02:04:29.380
<v Speaker 6>but it's not true in all cases.</v>

2469
02:04:36.400 --> 02:04:38.100
<v Speaker 6>What do you think about the moon landing</v>

2470
02:04:38.220 --> 02:04:39.210
<v Speaker 1>being a hoax?</v>

2471
02:04:41.550 --> 02:04:43.420
<v Speaker 1>It's hard for me to imagine it being a hope.</v>

2472
02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:45.241
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2473
02:04:45.241 --> 02:04:45.820
<v Speaker 1>there were a certain,</v>

2474
02:04:45.820 --> 02:04:46.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2475
02:04:46.560 --> 02:04:47.670
<v Speaker 1>there were quite a few</v>

2476
02:04:49.520 --> 02:04:53.510
<v Speaker 6>apollo missions that we're gearing up to be able to go to the moon before they</v>

2477
02:04:53.511 --> 02:04:54.470
<v Speaker 6>actually went to the moon.</v>

2478
02:04:56.570 --> 02:04:57.403
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2479
02:04:59.010 --> 02:04:59.251
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2480
02:04:59.251 --> 02:05:04.251
<v Speaker 6>if people think about the moon landing is being a hoax or that single moon</v>

2481
02:05:04.381 --> 02:05:05.214
<v Speaker 6>mission,</v>

2482
02:05:05.790 --> 02:05:06.623
<v Speaker 6>there were other</v>

2483
02:05:08.490 --> 02:05:09.570
<v Speaker 6>missions that were,</v>

2484
02:05:09.571 --> 02:05:10.404
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2485
02:05:10.680 --> 02:05:13.290
<v Speaker 6>that were vital to be able to get to the moon.</v>

2486
02:05:17.370 --> 02:05:18.203
<v Speaker 6>I believe,</v>

2487
02:05:18.300 --> 02:05:19.380
<v Speaker 6>if I'm remembering correctly,</v>

2488
02:06:04.830 --> 02:06:05.221
<v Speaker 6>Sophia,</v>

2489
02:06:05.221 --> 02:06:06.011
<v Speaker 6>all I'd say is like,</v>

2490
02:06:06.011 --> 02:06:07.960
<v Speaker 6>how do we know that we can't get through the van Allen Belt?</v>

2491
02:06:12.570 --> 02:06:13.403

2492
02:06:41.430 --> 02:06:42.600
<v Speaker 6>time and pressure</v>

02:06:55.560 --> 02:06:56.980
<v Speaker 6>what is a podcast about?</v>

2495
02:06:56.981 --> 02:06:57.520
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

2496
02:06:57.520 --> 02:06:58.360
<v Speaker 6>Ask Me your question.</v>

2497
02:07:12.370 --> 02:07:15.710
<v Speaker 6>I have sophia probably 10 years ago.</v>

2498
02:07:19.680 --> 02:07:20.513
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2499
02:07:49.300 --> 02:07:50.133
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2500
02:07:51.460 --> 02:07:53.020
<v Speaker 1>I haven't had a girlfriend before.</v>

02:08:30.330 --> 02:08:31.560
<v Speaker 6>Netflix all that much.</v>

2505
02:08:32.470 --> 02:08:33.510
<v Speaker 6>I watched mine hunter.</v>

2508
02:08:42.840 --> 02:08:45.330
<v Speaker 6>I think it was called blood something.</v>

2509
02:08:49.330 --> 02:08:50.163
<v Speaker 6>I'm from Chicago</v>

2510
02:08:53.050 --> 02:08:53.883
<v Speaker 6>in my thirties,</v>

02:09:03.350 --> 02:09:04.183
<v Speaker 1>who</v>

2512
02:09:06.340 --> 02:09:07.430
<v Speaker 6>I watched a lot of youtube.</v>

2513
02:09:14.140 --> 02:09:18.340
<v Speaker 6>I've been trying to pay them more and more attention to climate change.</v>

2514
02:09:20.650 --> 02:09:22.000
<v Speaker 6>Anthropogenic climate change.</v>

2515
02:09:25.760 --> 02:09:26.930
<v Speaker 6>What do you watch on Youtube?</v>

2516

2519
02:09:41.820 --> 02:09:42.653
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2520
02:09:45.810 --> 02:09:46.800
<v Speaker 6>a lot of different stuff.</v>

2521
02:09:50.890 --> 02:09:51.190
<v Speaker 6>So you,</v>

2522

<v Speaker 6>just graduated boot camp near Chicago?</v>

2524
02:09:57.710 --> 02:09:57.920
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2525
02:09:57.920 --> 02:09:58.110
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

2526
02:09:58.110 --> 02:09:59.130
<v Speaker 6>What branch of the service?</v>

2527
02:10:24.780 --> 02:10:26.790
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what they call career paths in the navy.</v>

2528
02:10:27.430 --> 02:10:28.091
<v Speaker 6>But what's your,</v>

2529
02:10:28.091 --> 02:10:28.480
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2530
02:10:28.480 --> 02:10:29.370
<v Speaker 6>what's the field that you're in?</v>

2531
02:10:31.600 --> 02:10:31.871
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2532
02:10:31.871 --> 02:10:32.704
<v Speaker 6>it's not Chris.</v>

2533
02:10:34.560 --> 02:10:35.550
<v Speaker 6>I'm not there right now.</v>

2534
02:10:35.940 --> 02:10:36.773
<v Speaker 6>I've moved.</v>

2535
02:10:38.450 --> 02:10:39.810
<v Speaker 6>It depends on where you're in Chicago,</v>

2536
02:10:39.811 --> 02:10:40.081
<v Speaker 6>but no,</v>

2537
02:10:40.081 --> 02:10:40.914
<v Speaker 6>it's not that bad</v>

2538
02:10:44.740 --> 02:10:45.573
<v Speaker 6>if you're,</v>

2539
02:10:46.330 --> 02:10:50.350
<v Speaker 6>if you're unfortunately unfortunate enough to be in a certain situation in a</v>

2540
02:10:50.351 --> 02:10:51.550
<v Speaker 6>certain tire in place,</v>

2541
02:10:51.551 --> 02:10:52.780
<v Speaker 6>then yeah,</v>

2542
02:10:52.781 --> 02:10:54.190
<v Speaker 6>then it can be bad.</v>

2543
02:10:56.170 --> 02:11:01.170
<v Speaker 6>My father was a union carpenter in Chicago and he worked on the west side and he</v>

2544
02:11:01.871 --> 02:11:05.750
<v Speaker 6>had been in multiple shootouts,</v>

2545
02:11:07.030 --> 02:11:09.910
<v Speaker 6>basically gang rival gangs shooting at each other</v>

2546
02:11:13.370 --> 02:11:13.610
<v Speaker 6>instead.</v>

2547
02:11:13.610 --> 02:11:15.320
<v Speaker 6>It was the most ridiculous stuff they ever saw.</v>

2548
02:11:15.590 --> 02:11:16.820
<v Speaker 6>Of course they'd go for cover,</v>

2549
02:11:16.821 --> 02:11:17.654
<v Speaker 6>but</v>

2550
02:11:18.860 --> 02:11:20.420
<v Speaker 6>basically a vehicle would roll up</v>

2551
02:11:22.010 --> 02:11:24.050
<v Speaker 6>and would just start shooting at a house.</v>

2552
02:11:26.850 --> 02:11:27.560
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2553
02:11:27.560 --> 02:11:28.460
<v Speaker 6>not really aiming.</v>

2554
02:11:42.040 --> 02:11:43.000
<v Speaker 6>You're in tech school.</v>

2555
02:12:00.090 --> 02:12:01.050
<v Speaker 6>You a feminist?</v>

2556
02:12:05.740 --> 02:12:07.060
<v Speaker 6>Sounds like a loaded question.</v>

2557
02:12:08.680 --> 02:12:11.890
<v Speaker 6>Do you think Americans are stupid or more stupid?</v>

2558
02:12:11.891 --> 02:12:12.724
<v Speaker 6>You mean</v>

2559
02:12:15.380 --> 02:12:16.213
<v Speaker 6>it's like a.</v>

2560
02:12:17.420 --> 02:12:19.240
<v Speaker 6>You asking that question is a.</v>

2561
02:12:24.690 --> 02:12:26.700
<v Speaker 6>What do you mean by more stupid?</v>

2562
02:12:29.030 --> 02:12:29.863
<v Speaker 1>As far as what?</v>

2563
02:12:35.920 --> 02:12:36.753
<v Speaker 6>Ooh,</v>

2564
02:12:51.840 --> 02:12:54.780
<v Speaker 6>I think Americans more isolated than other people in other countries.</v>

2565
02:12:58.100 --> 02:13:00.860
<v Speaker 6>I think America is lucky because it's southern border of Mexico,</v>

2566
02:13:01.220 --> 02:13:01.851
<v Speaker 6>whereas Europe,</v>

2567
02:13:01.851 --> 02:13:03.470
<v Speaker 6>southern border is Africa.</v>

2568
02:13:06.120 --> 02:13:11.120
<v Speaker 6>America would look like Europe if you flipped Mexico and Africa or it wouldn't.</v>

2569
02:13:15.540 --> 02:13:17.190
<v Speaker 6>You'd have a pretty authoritarian</v>

2570
02:13:18.770 --> 02:13:20.180
<v Speaker 6>element in the south</v>

2571
02:13:28.940 --> 02:13:30.860
<v Speaker 6>everywhere as people from all over the world.</v>

2572
02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:33.420
<v Speaker 6>Maybe less so and</v>

2573
02:13:36.470 --> 02:13:37.370
<v Speaker 6>some countries.</v>

2574
02:13:45.760 --> 02:13:45.891
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

2575
02:13:45.891 --> 02:13:46.271
<v Speaker 6>America.</v>

2576
02:13:46.271 --> 02:13:50.830
<v Speaker 6>Certainly as more people who probably migrated here from other countries,</v>

2577
02:13:52.840 --> 02:13:54.380
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

2578
02:14:19.920 --> 02:14:20.753
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

2579
02:14:22.930 --> 02:14:23.860
<v Speaker 6>Well this is getting.</v>

2580
02:14:30.320 --> 02:14:32.260
<v Speaker 6>It's been two hours and 15 minutes now.</v>

2581
02:14:46.230 --> 02:14:46.980
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2582
02:14:46.980 --> 02:14:48.870
<v Speaker 6>Well it's always fun to run on some people.</v>

2583
02:14:49.710 --> 02:14:50.131
<v Speaker 6>Alright guys.</v>

2584
02:14:50.131 --> 02:14:50.964
<v Speaker 6>I'm gonna.</v>

2585
02:14:52.400 --> 02:14:52.601
<v Speaker 6>I'm gonna.</v>

2586
02:14:52.601 --> 02:14:53.434
<v Speaker 6>Get going</v>

2587
02:14:55.280 --> 02:14:58.500
<v Speaker 6>some dinner and do whatever I do.</v>

2588
02:15:03.510 --> 02:15:04.343
<v Speaker 6>You're welcome.</v>

2589
02:15:05.990 --> 02:15:10.700
<v Speaker 6>Hopefully I can figure something out at some other point and maybe get monetized</v>

2590
02:15:10.701 --> 02:15:11.534
<v Speaker 6>and</v>

2591
02:15:12.470 --> 02:15:13.790
<v Speaker 6>we'll see if I can eventually ever</v>

2592
02:15:16.040 --> 02:15:17.930
<v Speaker 6>make it back on here permanently again</v>

2593
02:15:20.650 --> 02:15:20.861
<v Speaker 6>later.</v>

2594
02:15:20.861 --> 02:15:21.130
<v Speaker 6>Guys.</v>
