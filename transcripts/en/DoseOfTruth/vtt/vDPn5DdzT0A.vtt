00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.300
<v Speaker 1>So here's something to think about.</v>

2
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.830
<v Speaker 1>This is a way of approaching what Rogers was up to.</v>

3
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.070
<v Speaker 1>Imagine how you use words.</v>

4
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.991
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5
00:00:19.991 --> 00:00:21.790
<v Speaker 1>you could use words instrumentally.</v>

6
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:24.520
<v Speaker 1>Let's start with that.</v>

7
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.630
<v Speaker 1>If imagine that you want something from someone and then you might think,</v>

8
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.093
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

9
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.630
<v Speaker 1>how can I phrase my argument so that I'm going to get that from this person?</v>

10
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.400
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>

11
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.761
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

12
00:00:36.761 --> 00:00:40.180
<v Speaker 1>what sort of argument would appeal to that person and what buttons can I push</v>

13
00:00:40.181 --> 00:00:42.040
<v Speaker 1>and how can I get what I want?</v>

14
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.120
<v Speaker 1>And then you're using words in an instrumental way.</v>

15
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.890
<v Speaker 1>You're using them as tools to obtain what you desire from other people.</v>

16
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.731
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

17
00:00:51.731 --> 00:00:53.860
<v Speaker 1>I think if you do that completely,</v>

18
00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.210
<v Speaker 1>you're a psychopath.</v>

19
00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean that because a psychopath has no room for you at all.</v>

20
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.160
<v Speaker 1>It's about him or her and you're there to be used as an instrumental target.</v>

21
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:09.071
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

22
00:01:09.071 --> 00:01:12.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that every time someone uses language instrumentally,</v>

23
00:01:12.851 --> 00:01:15.280
<v Speaker 1>they're acting like a psychopath,</v>

24
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.473
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

25
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.520
<v Speaker 1>that's the logical conclusion to that form of language use.</v>

26
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.340
<v Speaker 1>Now then you might think,</v>

27
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.253
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

28
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.740
<v Speaker 1>you can ask little kids tried to do that to their parents,</v>

29
00:01:30.741 --> 00:01:31.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

30
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.140
<v Speaker 1>Siblings will often collude,</v>

31
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.330
<v Speaker 1>we'll have a little conspiratorial conversation about how to approach one parent</v>

32
00:01:38.331 --> 00:01:38.990
<v Speaker 1>or the other.</v>

33
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.940
<v Speaker 1>Usually by isolating the parents,</v>

34
00:01:40.941 --> 00:01:42.020
<v Speaker 1>that's a good strategy.</v>

35
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.380
<v Speaker 1>And then they'll phrase their requests so that they can extract out the desired</v>

36
00:01:47.481 --> 00:01:48.314
<v Speaker 1>benefit.</v>

37
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.533
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

38
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.760
<v Speaker 1>I follow these pickup artists online,</v>

39
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:54.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

40
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.840
<v Speaker 1>being very interested in their use of psychology.</v>

41
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.390
<v Speaker 1>And they are instrumental language users,</v>

42
00:01:59.391 --> 00:01:59.661
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

43
00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:04.430
<v Speaker 1>So their trick is they're developing a whole little hope,</v>

44
00:02:04.431 --> 00:02:09.410
<v Speaker 1>hurry of verbal tricks that they use in attempts to seduce.</v>

45
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.820
<v Speaker 1>It's a very narrow focus and it's instrumental language.</v>

46
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.730
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

47
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.990
<v Speaker 1>it's as if that the personhood of the,</v>

48
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.950
<v Speaker 1>of the target is irrelevant fundamentally.</v>

49
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.290
<v Speaker 1>So it's a fairly pathological,</v>

50
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.670
<v Speaker 1>it can become pathological,</v>

51
00:02:25.671 --> 00:02:26.504
<v Speaker 1>very easy.</v>

52
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:27.681
<v Speaker 1>So then you might say,</v>

53
00:02:27.681 --> 00:02:28.430
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

54
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.250
<v Speaker 1>how would you use language if you weren't using instrumentally?</v>

55
00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:31.711
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>

56
00:02:31.711 --> 00:02:34.370
<v Speaker 1>you have to have a career and you have to be goal oriented.</v>

57
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.870
<v Speaker 1>You have to be aimed towards things.</v>

58
00:02:35.871 --> 00:02:38.210
<v Speaker 1>And so since you have to be goal oriented,</v>

59
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.470
<v Speaker 1>how can it be other than that,</v>

60
00:02:42.471 --> 00:02:44.180
<v Speaker 1>you would use language instrumental.</v>
