1
00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.380
<v Speaker 1>You just don't want someone acting radically around you like and you know that.</v>

2
00:00:08.381 --> 00:00:09.670
<v Speaker 1>So he walked down Bluer.</v>

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.510
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4
00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.210
<v Speaker 1>And there's people there that should really be institutionalized,</v>

5
00:00:14.211 --> 00:00:19.010
<v Speaker 1>but we deinstitutionalized them all so they could be free and free to be,</v>

6
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.173
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.810
<v Speaker 1>suffering and malfunctioning out on the street.</v>

8
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.370
<v Speaker 1>That's what the freedom ended up being.</v>

9
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.911
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

10
00:00:25.911 --> 00:00:28.220
<v Speaker 1>when you walk by someone like that who's</v>

11
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.960
<v Speaker 1>moderating away to the voices in his head and you know,</v>

12
00:00:32.961 --> 00:00:33.794
<v Speaker 1>maybe</v>

13
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.600
<v Speaker 1>striking out against whatever it is that's plaguing him and you will make eye</v>

14
00:00:40.851 --> 00:00:41.684
<v Speaker 1>contact.</v>

15
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.420
<v Speaker 1>You might even go across the street,</v>

16
00:00:44.421 --> 00:00:46.310
<v Speaker 1>you're certainly going to give him a wide berth.</v>

17
00:00:46.311 --> 00:00:51.311
<v Speaker 1>You're going to keep a distance between him and you and you're going to hope</v>

18
00:00:51.321 --> 00:00:56.180
<v Speaker 1>that you don't attract his attention because he's not in the dominance hierarchy</v>

19
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.640
<v Speaker 1>and you don't know what the hell he might do.</v>

20
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.490
<v Speaker 1>And that's unexplored territory too.</v>

21
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.470
<v Speaker 1>That's another way of thinking about it.</v>

22
00:01:03.471 --> 00:01:04.304
<v Speaker 1>Like</v>

23
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.340
<v Speaker 1>we inhabit time and space,</v>

24
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.380
<v Speaker 1>not just space and not just time.</v>

25
00:01:09.381 --> 00:01:14.000
<v Speaker 1>We didn't have it time and space and our territory's our spacial temporal.</v>

26
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.240
<v Speaker 1>We're here now and this is safe now and it's safe partly because of the physical</v>

27
00:01:20.301 --> 00:01:21.590
<v Speaker 1>structure and it's working,</v>

28
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.420
<v Speaker 1>but it's also safe because none of you are manifesting peculiar behavior.</v>

29
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.410
<v Speaker 1>But if you started to manifest peculiar behavior,</v>

30
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.160
<v Speaker 1>if you stood up and started muttering or yelling or maybe attacking someone next</v>

31
00:01:36.171 --> 00:01:37.004
<v Speaker 1>to you,</v>

32
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.270
<v Speaker 1>all the rest of you would freeze first because then all of a sudden this would</v>

33
00:01:41.271 --> 00:01:42.650
<v Speaker 1>be unexplored territory.</v>

34
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.500
<v Speaker 1>The match between what you want,</v>

35
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.500
<v Speaker 1>which is a peaceful lecture that you hope has some content.</v>

36
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.050
<v Speaker 1>The match between what you want and what's happening has vanished.</v>

37
00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.060
<v Speaker 1>And so then you're not,</v>

38
00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:58.470
<v Speaker 1>you don't know where you are.</v>

39
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.920
<v Speaker 1>And so then what do you do when you don't know where you are?</v>

40
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.470
<v Speaker 1>What do you do when you don't know what to do?</v>

41
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.491
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

42
00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:06.241
<v Speaker 1>if your computer,</v>

43
00:02:06.241 --> 00:02:07.200
<v Speaker 1>you just crash,</v>

44
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.370
<v Speaker 1>but you know what good is that to you?</v>

45
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.570
<v Speaker 1>You're just going to die.</v>

46
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.860
<v Speaker 1>That isn't helpful.</v>

47
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.850
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

48
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.850
<v Speaker 1>You freeze first and then maybe you cautiously cautiously attend or maybe you</v>

49
00:02:21.431 --> 00:02:21.700
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

50
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.940
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you just keep your damn eyes averted and you sit there and you hope that</v>

51
00:02:24.941 --> 00:02:25.900
<v Speaker 1>no one notices you.</v>

52
00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.093
<v Speaker 1>That's a predator.</v>

53
00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.450
<v Speaker 1>That's a prey response,</v>

54
00:02:28.451 --> 00:02:28.661
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

55
00:02:28.661 --> 00:02:31.810
<v Speaker 1>That's like a rabbit frozen when it thinks that Fox is looking at it.</v>

56
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.910
<v Speaker 1>And we were prey animals for a long time.</v>

57
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.720
<v Speaker 1>There was a cat that they recently discovered,</v>

58
00:02:37.721 --> 00:02:42.721
<v Speaker 1>a prehistoric cap that had this bottom single tooth and they found out that it a</v>

59
00:02:43.391 --> 00:02:45.490
<v Speaker 1>human skull fit right inside its mouth.</v>

60
00:02:45.491 --> 00:02:49.210
<v Speaker 1>And so it could grab you here and Pierce the back of your skull with its,</v>

61
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.400
<v Speaker 1>with its single tooth.</v>

62
00:02:51.401 --> 00:02:53.050
<v Speaker 1>And that's what it was evolved for.</v>

63
00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.213
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

64
00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.083
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

65
00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:57.420
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

66
00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.590
<v Speaker 1>it's under such conditions.</v>

67
00:02:58.591 --> 00:03:01.090
<v Speaker 1>We evolved and we're predators obviously,</v>

68
00:03:01.091 --> 00:03:02.680
<v Speaker 1>but we're tasty predators.</v>

69
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.680
<v Speaker 1>And so other things were perfectly happy to eat us.</v>

70
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:08.783
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

71
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.900
<v Speaker 1>And so when you're aware you don't know what to do,</v>

72
00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:15.430
<v Speaker 1>you act like a prey animal and that's probably what you should do because maybe</v>

73
00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:18.310
<v Speaker 1>if you keep your head down and shut the hell up,</v>

74
00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.290
<v Speaker 1>there won't be any attention to attracted to you.</v>

75
00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.240
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you'll get through it.</v>

76
00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:24.493
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

77
00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.850
<v Speaker 1>you might decide,</v>

78
00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.010
<v Speaker 1>unlikely to intervene and take the guy down,</v>

79
00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:32.383
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

80
00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.230
<v Speaker 1>but you would be the exception rather than the norm.</v>

81
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.510
<v Speaker 1>And it's unsurprising.</v>

82
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.640
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
