00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.780
<v Speaker 1>Please tell us about your ideas of the problem of gender integrated combat units</v>

2
00:00:18.781 --> 00:00:20.010
<v Speaker 1>and how it affects morale.</v>

3
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.840
<v Speaker 1>Please talk about the rule trans people should or should not serve in combat</v>

4
00:00:24.841 --> 00:00:25.674
<v Speaker 1>units.</v>

5
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.933
<v Speaker 1>Huh.</v>

6
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

7
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.441
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8
00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:29.274
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say that</v>

9
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.210
<v Speaker 1>exactly an expert in that regard.</v>

10
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:34.603
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

11
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how gender</v>

12
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:41.221
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>

13
00:00:41.221 --> 00:00:43.860
<v Speaker 1>multiple gendered combat units are going to work.</v>

14
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:44.730
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

15
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.540
<v Speaker 1>because I'm fundamentally a traditionalist in most ways,</v>

16
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.830
<v Speaker 1>mostly because I'm afraid of the unintended consequences of radical change.</v>

17
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.110
<v Speaker 1>I would say that it's dangerous to adjust a system that's working and it's very</v>

18
00:00:58.111 --> 00:01:00.510
<v Speaker 1>hard for me to imagine a situation,</v>

19
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.050
<v Speaker 1>especially in a combat situation where the women and men can actually be treated</v>

20
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:08.490
<v Speaker 1>equally.</v>

21
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that the broader society would even want to see that.</v>

22
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

23
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.850
<v Speaker 1>I suppose there are exceptions to that sort of thing,</v>

24
00:01:14.851 --> 00:01:15.320
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

25
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.050
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

26
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.883
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

27
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.930
<v Speaker 1>the situation perhaps in Israel,</v>

28
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.460
<v Speaker 1>although I suspect even in Israel that the women take the more,</v>

29
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.580
<v Speaker 1>the less combat heavy jobs.</v>

30
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.060
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

31
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that,</v>

32
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.050
<v Speaker 1>but maybe I'm just being prejudiced in that answer,</v>

33
00:01:31.051 --> 00:01:31.884
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

34
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.790
<v Speaker 1>it just doesn't seem to me to be a very wise idea.</v>

35
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.450
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

36
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.730
<v Speaker 1>what role trans people should serve.</v>

37
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.020
<v Speaker 1>I really can't say.</v>

38
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't have anything,</v>

39
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.070
<v Speaker 1>any advice about that.</v>

40
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:48.483
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not</v>

41
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.730
<v Speaker 1>informed enough to make,</v>

42
00:01:51.731 --> 00:01:52.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

43
00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:53.283
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

44
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

45
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.000
<v Speaker 1>a conclusion about that.</v>

46
00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.950
<v Speaker 1>I think it's very strange.</v>

47
00:01:56.951 --> 00:01:57.784
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

48
00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.200
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to some people in the Canadian armed forces and in recent months,</v>

49
00:02:02.201 --> 00:02:07.201
<v Speaker 1>and I do think it's very strange that this is the sort of problem that our</v>

50
00:02:07.241 --> 00:02:09.260
<v Speaker 1>military is actually trying to solve for.</v>

51
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.480
<v Speaker 1>You think that there would be more important things to concentrate on them?</v>

52
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.640
<v Speaker 1>Rapid Gender,</v>

53
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.823
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

54
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.790
<v Speaker 1>equalization in the military.</v>

55
00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.510
<v Speaker 1>I just don't see why that's such a priority,</v>

56
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.380
<v Speaker 1>but maybe that's just my old fashioned conservatism speaking.</v>

57
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:28.750
<v Speaker 1>It could be,</v>

58
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:31.390
<v Speaker 1>it could be that right.</v>
