1
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.150
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about the Saudis for a minute.</v>

2
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.610
<v Speaker 1>The elephant under the western carpet,</v>

3
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean I understand that in the aftermath of the oil crisis in the 1970s one of</v>

4
00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:20.430
<v Speaker 1>the things that that dictated American foreign policy was the desire to maintain</v>

5
00:00:20.431 --> 00:00:21.660
<v Speaker 1>stable oil production.</v>

6
00:00:21.661 --> 00:00:21.900
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

7
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.930
<v Speaker 1>and I can understand that although I think it was short sighted,</v>

8
00:00:24.931 --> 00:00:25.320
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>

9
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.670
<v Speaker 1>I can see the logic in that,</v>

10
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.180
<v Speaker 1>but it's very difficult for me to see that in any possible way the Saudis can be</v>

11
00:00:32.641 --> 00:00:34.650
<v Speaker 1>regarded as true allies of the West.</v>

12
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.790
<v Speaker 1>And so I don't understand why we have the relationship that we do have with the</v>

13
00:00:40.891 --> 00:00:41.790
<v Speaker 1>Saudis given,</v>

14
00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:42.301
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

15
00:00:42.301 --> 00:00:46.950
<v Speaker 1>that we're pumping literally trillions of dollars every about every decade into</v>

16
00:00:46.951 --> 00:00:47.784
<v Speaker 1>the ricotta me.</v>

17
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.520
<v Speaker 1>And then given that they practice a particularly pernicious form of,</v>

18
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.960
<v Speaker 1>I would say viciously militant Islam and second or third I guess that is,</v>

19
00:00:57.061 --> 00:01:02.061
<v Speaker 1>is that they're pumping out propaganda that pushes this Wahhabi viewpoint in</v>

20
00:01:02.491 --> 00:01:04.590
<v Speaker 1>massive doses everywhere in the world.</v>

21
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:05.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

22
00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand,</v>

23
00:01:06.481 --> 00:01:10.200
<v Speaker 1>and maybe this is also part of your perplexity with regards to western attitudes</v>

24
00:01:10.201 --> 00:01:11.034
<v Speaker 1>towards,</v>

25
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.960
<v Speaker 1>towards the complex problem of Islam.</v>

26
00:01:12.961 --> 00:01:17.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand why the West doesn't do more to put a stop to that.</v>

27
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.550
<v Speaker 1>And so what are your thoughts about that?</v>

28
00:01:20.551 --> 00:01:21.630
<v Speaker 1>How does it look to you?</v>

29
00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:23.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm a flexed,</v>

30
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.130
<v Speaker 1>I believe that the south would have booked the United States and other western</v>

31
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.270
<v Speaker 1>listeners and someone has to come along and break that.</v>

32
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:32.763
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

33
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:33.520
<v Speaker 1>I liked it.</v>

34
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean I agree with everything can you said within Saudi Arabia they don't have,</v>

35
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.270
<v Speaker 1>I believe at least three,</v>

36
00:01:40.271 --> 00:01:45.271
<v Speaker 1>four seconds that the royal family who I believe no one wants to be more secular</v>

37
00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.713
<v Speaker 1>and more model,</v>

38
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.980
<v Speaker 1>they want to go down</v>

39
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.190
<v Speaker 1>and then stick larger,</v>

40
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.960
<v Speaker 1>incredibly powerful,</v>

41
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.050
<v Speaker 1>maybe even more powerful than the Hawaiian side because the clergy in Saudi</v>

42
00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.240
<v Speaker 1>Arabia,</v>

43
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.070
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

44
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.070
<v Speaker 1>they have the power to put into people's heads and hearts the Wahhabi doctrine.</v>

45
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.580
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

46
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.850
<v Speaker 1>so they are all about in Saudi Arabia,</v>

47
00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.230
<v Speaker 1>people who decide what's wrong moral or other clergy time,</v>

48
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:20.540
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

49
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

50
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.673
<v Speaker 1>That's powerful.</v>

51
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.550
<v Speaker 1>And then you have the tribe,</v>

52
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.250
<v Speaker 1>the various tribes who obviously depending on their size,</v>

53
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.390
<v Speaker 1>can empower la Croix royal familiar or the cloud or both.</v>

54
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.630
<v Speaker 1>There's a dynamic there that is very interesting to watch.</v>

55
00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.200
<v Speaker 1>But in that sense Saudi Arabia has used and has been George,</v>

56
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.460
<v Speaker 1>it's larger</v>

57
00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.983
<v Speaker 1>established.</v>

58
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.640
<v Speaker 1>He will making a legacy.</v>

59
00:02:49.641 --> 00:02:51.140
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia is a few offices,</v>

60
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:52.803
<v Speaker 1>fewer Medina,</v>

61
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.400
<v Speaker 1>not totally inside the borders of Saudi Arabia and Tyler.</v>

62
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:00.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah and no.</v>

63
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:01.631
<v Speaker 1>I think we,</v>

64
00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:06.631
<v Speaker 1>the United States and other countries need to be mad from the Saudi royal family</v>

65
00:03:06.731 --> 00:03:08.680
<v Speaker 1>because they're the ones who are political,</v>

66
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.100
<v Speaker 1>at least the political individuals that we deal with her.</v>

67
00:03:12.101 --> 00:03:17.101
<v Speaker 1>We sits you of course for the Tj to demand and say we need a divorce between the</v>

68
00:03:18.371 --> 00:03:22.910
<v Speaker 1>house of health south and the house of how hub because these clergy people are</v>

69
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.910
<v Speaker 1>really destroy the planet.</v>

70
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:26.753
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>

71
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.150
<v Speaker 1>you have to think through what these people have done in South Asia,</v>

72
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:32.163
<v Speaker 1>in Africa,</v>

73
00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.270
<v Speaker 1>all over the world.</v>

74
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.950
<v Speaker 1>It's the beauty of</v>

75
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.980
<v Speaker 1>a part of its wealth to the spread of Islam.</v>

76
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.700
<v Speaker 1>Islam that's pure that way.</v>

77
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.800
<v Speaker 1>That is through institutions and this is,</v>

78
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.930
<v Speaker 1>this is therefore in policy.</v>

79
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.720
<v Speaker 1>We probably could refer that to us soft house.</v>

80
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.860
<v Speaker 1>That's where the [inaudible] but that if you look at what is happening with all</v>

81
00:03:56.861 --> 00:03:59.800
<v Speaker 1>these terrorist activities across the world,</v>

82
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.590
<v Speaker 1>people wanting Shiria back,</v>

83
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:03.480
<v Speaker 1>all of this,</v>

84
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.800
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia is behind it.</v>

85
00:04:04.801 --> 00:04:07.010
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's time for that.</v>

86
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

87
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:08.021
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

88
00:04:08.021 --> 00:04:09.700
<v Speaker 1>So let me run a theory by you.</v>

89
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.620
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a two fold theory.</v>

90
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:17.070
<v Speaker 1>So one is that there's a paternalistic attitude in the west towards the Saudis</v>

91
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:22.510
<v Speaker 1>that stems from perhaps events that were as far back as 100 years ago.</v>

92
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.790
<v Speaker 1>And the journalistic aspect is to underestimate them as enemies,</v>

93
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

94
00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:29.351
<v Speaker 1>Because you say,</v>

95
00:04:29.351 --> 00:04:29.531
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

96
00:04:29.531 --> 00:04:30.011
<v Speaker 1>we could say,</v>

97
00:04:30.011 --> 00:04:33.760
<v Speaker 1>well we need the oil and we're going to stabilize it and maybe that we'd rather</v>

98
00:04:33.761 --> 00:04:35.350
<v Speaker 1>not have chaos in Saudi Arabia.</v>

99
00:04:35.351 --> 00:04:38.530
<v Speaker 1>And so a known dictator is better than unknown chaos.</v>

100
00:04:38.531 --> 00:04:42.550
<v Speaker 1>And I mean we saw some proof of that perhaps in what happened with Libya,</v>

101
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.740
<v Speaker 1>but so the idea would be there's nothing sufficiently dangerous about the Saudis</v>

102
00:04:47.741 --> 00:04:50.380
<v Speaker 1>to justify us destabilizing their regime,</v>

103
00:04:50.381 --> 00:04:52.900
<v Speaker 1>especially when we're particularly dependent on their oil.</v>

104
00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.000
<v Speaker 1>And then underneath that would be an underestimation of the danger of ideas.</v>

105
00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.661
<v Speaker 1>And also,</v>

106
00:04:58.661 --> 00:05:00.790
<v Speaker 1>especially when ideas are combined with money,</v>

107
00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:01.840
<v Speaker 1>it's something like that.</v>

108
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.220
<v Speaker 1>So because the Saudis in some sense I think are are fighting what you might</v>

109
00:05:06.221 --> 00:05:11.221
<v Speaker 1>regard as a stealth war against the west and they're doing it by convincing</v>

110
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.190
<v Speaker 1>upcoming generations of the rightness of their particular viewpoint.</v>

111
00:05:15.191 --> 00:05:17.770
<v Speaker 1>And so they're in it for the long haul in some sense.</v>

112
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.770
<v Speaker 1>And I think we're radically underestimating the danger of that logical walk.</v>

113
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:23.350
<v Speaker 1>And we are not.</v>

114
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:24.150
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

115
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.500
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

116
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.333
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

117
00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.293
<v Speaker 1>Ideological.</v>

118
00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:27.403
<v Speaker 1>We're not,</v>

119
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have to think of when the Soviet Union was around,</v>

120
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.570
<v Speaker 1>if we hadn't done anything increase was if we had only viewed that in economic</v>

121
00:05:34.571 --> 00:05:35.860
<v Speaker 1>terms go in military terms.</v>

122
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.073
<v Speaker 1>And that is</v>

123
00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.490
<v Speaker 1>not just telling Rabia this is even Iran.</v>

124
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:48.060
<v Speaker 1>These countries are waging an ideological war and we are not because leave,</v>

125
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.670
<v Speaker 1>well it's religion.</v>

126
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.780
<v Speaker 1>Religion is protected and you know,</v>

127
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:58.910
<v Speaker 1>we don't talk about [inaudible] and that's one thing we believe we are under the</v>

128
00:05:58.911 --> 00:06:00.930
<v Speaker 1>spell of these be quite charming.</v>

129
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.420
<v Speaker 1>So that's come to attend our universities that have the embassies do business</v>

130
00:06:05.421 --> 00:06:08.900
<v Speaker 1>with us and that reassure us that they're more westernized than we are.</v>

131
00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:11.690
<v Speaker 1>You can tell them by how they treat their women.</v>

132
00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:14.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

133
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.051
<v Speaker 1>So in a way,</v>

134
00:06:15.051 --> 00:06:15.680
<v Speaker 1>I think we,</v>

135
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.131
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

136
00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:20.690
<v Speaker 1>I just keep going back and say we are under some sort of spells and at some</v>

137
00:06:20.691 --> 00:06:23.660
<v Speaker 1>point someone has to come and break that smell.</v>

138
00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:24.753
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

139
00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.380
<v Speaker 1>It's real vogue globalization through,</v>

140
00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:28.373
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

141
00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:29.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

142
00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.860
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia opens up to the world.</v>

143
