1
00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:11.590
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you have a child and they're playing soccer and uh,</v>

2
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.760
<v Speaker 1>your child is a pretty good soccer player.</v>

3
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:15.800
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.850
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you a different story.</v>

5
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.160
<v Speaker 1>This actually happened.</v>

6
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.470
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to tell you a story about hockey and I'm since I'm Canadian.</v>

7
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:25.311
<v Speaker 1>What the hell?</v>

8
00:00:25.311 --> 00:00:26.780
<v Speaker 1>I might as well tell you a story about hockey.</v>

9
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.113
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

10
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.690
<v Speaker 1>my son played hockey,</v>

11
00:00:29.691 --> 00:00:30.680
<v Speaker 1>he still plays hockey.</v>

12
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.150
<v Speaker 1>He's a pretty good hockey player.</v>

13
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.410
<v Speaker 1>And my wife and I used to go watch him play hockey.</v>

14
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.010
<v Speaker 1>There was an arena just down the street from us and there was a nice</v>

15
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.240
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood league there.</v>

16
00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:46.160
<v Speaker 1>And so they'd start the kids into teams and then they'd let them play a few demo</v>

17
00:00:46.161 --> 00:00:46.994
<v Speaker 1>games.</v>

18
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
<v Speaker 1>And if any team was getting stomped flat or any other team was winning too much,</v>

19
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.700
<v Speaker 1>then they'd rebalanced the team so that they were approximately equal in skill.</v>

20
00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.350
<v Speaker 1>And so that was the sorting of the teams.</v>

21
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.401
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

22
00:01:01.401 --> 00:01:02.234
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

23
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.790
<v Speaker 1>and then they,</v>

24
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.660
<v Speaker 1>then they were on their teams and then they play,</v>

25
00:01:05.661 --> 00:01:06.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.540
<v Speaker 1>15 games during the regular season.</v>

27
00:01:08.541 --> 00:01:10.040
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have a little tournament to see who won.</v>

28
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.930
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

29
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:11.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

30
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.200
<v Speaker 1>it was really good.</v>

31
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.670
<v Speaker 1>It was good friendly league and so my son's team was in,</v>

32
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.970
<v Speaker 1>I think it was the championship game if I remember correctly.</v>

33
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.370
<v Speaker 1>And there's one kid on his team who is the best player on the team,</v>

34
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.840
<v Speaker 1>but by quite a margin,</v>

35
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:27.171
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:01:27.171 --> 00:01:28.700
<v Speaker 1>he was very fast on his feet.</v>

37
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.990
<v Speaker 1>He could,</v>

38
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.820
<v Speaker 1>he could skate rings around a lot of the kids.</v>

39
00:01:31.821 --> 00:01:32.920
<v Speaker 1>He was good at stick handling.</v>

40
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:33.920
<v Speaker 1>He was a good hockey player.</v>

41
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:35.653
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

42
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.850
<v Speaker 1>he had some problems.</v>

43
00:01:37.851 --> 00:01:38.684
<v Speaker 1>This kid,</v>

44
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.870
<v Speaker 1>one problem was he wouldn't pass the puck.</v>

45
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.641
<v Speaker 1>Now you think,</v>

46
00:01:43.641 --> 00:01:43.761
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

47
00:01:43.761 --> 00:01:46.340
<v Speaker 1>why the hell should you pass the puck if you're the best hockey player?</v>

48
00:01:46.341 --> 00:01:47.690
<v Speaker 1>Which is pretty much what he thought.</v>

49
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.040
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is,</v>

50
00:01:49.041 --> 00:01:49.874
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

51
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:51.980
<v Speaker 1>you're part of the team,</v>

52
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:53.060
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

53
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.130
<v Speaker 1>You want to be the best person on the team,</v>

54
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.923
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>

55
00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.370
<v Speaker 1>And you want to win the hockey game.</v>

56
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.280
<v Speaker 1>But you also want to what?</v>

57
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.400
<v Speaker 1>Make your team mates better players.</v>

58
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:05.803
<v Speaker 1>How's that?</v>

59
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.120
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you even want to meet the people on other teams,</v>

60
00:02:08.121 --> 00:02:08.960
<v Speaker 1>better players.</v>

61
00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.150
<v Speaker 1>I knew now I know that's going a little bit too far,</v>

62
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.220
<v Speaker 1>but you certainly want to make your teammates better players and you might</v>

63
00:02:16.221 --> 00:02:16.431
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

64
00:02:16.431 --> 00:02:16.581
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

65
00:02:16.581 --> 00:02:17.361
<v Speaker 1>why would you do that?</v>

66
00:02:17.361 --> 00:02:19.760
<v Speaker 1>Because if they're better than maybe you won't be the best.</v>

67
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.160
<v Speaker 1>While that's a boneheaded way of looking at the world because first of all,</v>

68
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.650
<v Speaker 1>if you amp up the competition around you,</v>

69
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.440
<v Speaker 1>maybe that will motivate you to eat to be even better.</v>

70
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.190
<v Speaker 1>And it's a hell of a way to win by making everyone else lose.</v>

71
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.380
<v Speaker 1>That's not much of a victory.</v>

72
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.390
<v Speaker 1>And so if you have any sense,</v>

73
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.400
<v Speaker 1>you pass the damn puck,</v>

74
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.020
<v Speaker 1>even if you're the better player,</v>

75
00:02:42.021 --> 00:02:44.240
<v Speaker 1>especially you especially do that.</v>

76
00:02:44.241 --> 00:02:46.790
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you've got a comfortable two goal lead,</v>

77
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.780
<v Speaker 1>well then maybe you can risk taking the time away from that specific game to</v>

78
00:02:54.351 --> 00:02:55.580
<v Speaker 1>build up the confidence,</v>

79
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:56.451
<v Speaker 1>confidence,</v>

80
00:02:56.451 --> 00:02:58.040
<v Speaker 1>and ability of your team mates.</v>

81
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.750
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe everybody thinks that you're a bit of a leader and they make you</v>

82
00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:02.590
<v Speaker 1>team captain.</v>

83
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.320
<v Speaker 1>Not even so much because you're the best hockey player,</v>

84
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:06.154
<v Speaker 1>but because,</v>

85
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:07.001
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

86
00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:07.834
<v Speaker 1>because why?</v>

87
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.400
<v Speaker 1>That's the question.</v>

88
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.821
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

89
00:03:09.821 --> 00:03:14.230
<v Speaker 1>So we're watching the game and it's pretty exciting and it's real close game and</v>

90
00:03:14.231 --> 00:03:19.231
<v Speaker 1>it's like three to three and it's a minute left and another team zips down.</v>

91
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.360
<v Speaker 1>The nice and scores are really brilliant goal.</v>

92
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.510
<v Speaker 1>And so my son's team loses except that they were in the championship and it was</v>

93
00:03:28.031 --> 00:03:28.990
<v Speaker 1>a really good game.</v>

94
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.770
<v Speaker 1>So you know whether or not they lost is not all that obvious.</v>

95
00:03:32.771 --> 00:03:33.850
<v Speaker 1>They lost that game.</v>

96
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.841
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

97
00:03:34.841 --> 00:03:37.570
<v Speaker 1>there's the broader context to take into consideration.</v>

98
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:38.111
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

99
00:03:38.111 --> 00:03:39.880
<v Speaker 1>so this kid,</v>

100
00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:41.470
<v Speaker 1>this this,</v>

101
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.240
<v Speaker 1>the star goes off the ice and he takes his hockey stick and he smashes it on to</v>

102
00:03:46.241 --> 00:03:49.750
<v Speaker 1>the cement and he's all angry because as far as he was concerned,</v>

103
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:50.890
<v Speaker 1>he was robbed.</v>

104
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.050
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that's because of is useless.</v>

105
00:03:53.051 --> 00:03:56.860
<v Speaker 1>Team mates who he didn't really spend any time helping by the way.</v>

106
00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.120
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it's because the referees were unfair and who the hell knows why but</v>

107
00:04:01.121 --> 00:04:06.121
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't fair and his idiot farther rushes over to them and consoles and and on</v>

108
00:04:08.621 --> 00:04:13.030
<v Speaker 1>his loss and supports him in his notion that he was robbed.</v>

109
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.760
<v Speaker 1>And I thought you unspeakable son of a bitch</v>

110
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.980
<v Speaker 1>because he was an arrogant narcissist and it was way more important to him that</v>

111
00:04:29.101 --> 00:04:32.130
<v Speaker 1>he had a son who was a star then,</v>

112
00:04:32.131 --> 00:04:34.470
<v Speaker 1>that he had a son who is a good person.</v>

113
00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.970
<v Speaker 1>And that's absolutely inexcusable.</v>

114
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.280
<v Speaker 1>He made the wrong choice.</v>

115
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.610
<v Speaker 1>He sacrificed his son's soul in part to help him save face for a hockey game.</v>

116
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.520
<v Speaker 1>That's not acceptable.</v>

117
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.411
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

118
00:04:53.411 --> 00:04:54.880
<v Speaker 1>So here's what you tell your children.</v>

119
00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.840
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter whether you win or lose,</v>

120
00:04:58.841 --> 00:05:00.070
<v Speaker 1>it matters how you play the game.</v>

121
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.900
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what the father should have told the son and he should have meant</v>

122
00:05:04.901 --> 00:05:05.380
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

123
00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.041
<v Speaker 1>And even better,</v>

124
00:05:06.041 --> 00:05:07.540
<v Speaker 1>he should have known what it meant.</v>

125
00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.920
<v Speaker 1>But who knows what that means because you tell your children that and maybe</v>

126
00:05:11.921 --> 00:05:15.790
<v Speaker 1>they're not so happy because they lost the game and they look at you like you're</v>

127
00:05:15.791 --> 00:05:16.624
<v Speaker 1>an alien.</v>

128
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.801
<v Speaker 1>And they think,</v>

129
00:05:17.801 --> 00:05:17.951
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

130
00:05:17.951 --> 00:05:19.180
<v Speaker 1>what the hell do you mean by that?</v>

131
00:05:19.181 --> 00:05:24.070
<v Speaker 1>Because obviously it matters whether you win and it does matter whether you win.</v>

132
00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.790
<v Speaker 1>So what is it that you mean when you say that and your kid asks,</v>

133
00:05:27.791 --> 00:05:28.870
<v Speaker 1>well what do you mean by that?</v>

134
00:05:28.871 --> 00:05:30.010
<v Speaker 1>And you go,</v>

135
00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:30.491
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

136
00:05:30.491 --> 00:05:31.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it means,</v>

137
00:05:31.391 --> 00:05:32.830
<v Speaker 1>but it's a good rule.</v>

138
00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.940
<v Speaker 1>So what do you mean by that?</v>

139
00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.440
<v Speaker 1>Here's what you mean.</v>

140
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.530
<v Speaker 1>And it relates to rule five,</v>

141
00:05:42.531 --> 00:05:43.730
<v Speaker 1>which is don't make your,</v>

142
00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.790
<v Speaker 1>don't let your children do anything that makes you dislike them because other</v>

143
00:05:46.791 --> 00:05:48.260
<v Speaker 1>people will dislike them then.</v>

144
00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.710
<v Speaker 1>And you don't want other people to dislike your children unless you want your</v>

145
00:05:51.711 --> 00:05:54.710
<v Speaker 1>children to inhabit a world where everyone dislikes them.</v>

146
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.560
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you do because you don't like children.</v>

147
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.920
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you don't like your children because you let them behave in ways that</v>

148
00:06:00.921 --> 00:06:02.120
<v Speaker 1>makes you not like them.</v>

149
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.750
<v Speaker 1>And so the way you take revenge is by not correcting them so that other people</v>

150
00:06:05.751 --> 00:06:08.630
<v Speaker 1>will punish them because you don't have the courage to discipline them.</v>

151
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.090
<v Speaker 1>And if you think that people don't play that game,</v>

152
00:06:11.091 --> 00:06:14.540
<v Speaker 1>then you don't know much about people because they play that game all the time.</v>
