1
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.970
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that's really struck me about intellectual life is how often</v>

2
00:00:14.991 --> 00:00:19.460
<v Speaker 1>we get the questions wrong and we often get them backwards,</v>

3
00:00:19.461 --> 00:00:20.151
<v Speaker 1>not just wrong,</v>

4
00:00:20.151 --> 00:00:21.290
<v Speaker 1>but actually backwards.</v>

5
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.810
<v Speaker 1>So as a clinical psychologist,</v>

6
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.570
<v Speaker 1>I've often treated people with anxiety and uh,</v>

7
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.540
<v Speaker 1>people wonder practically individually,</v>

8
00:00:32.541 --> 00:00:33.290
<v Speaker 1>clinically,</v>

9
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.060
<v Speaker 1>why are people anxious?</v>

10
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.230
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's a completely ridiculous question.</v>

11
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.933
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

12
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.870
<v Speaker 1>the reasons for anxiety are starkly self evident.</v>

13
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.400
<v Speaker 1>What I wonder is why aren't people terrified out of their skulls so badly every</v>

14
00:00:49.401 --> 00:00:51.770
<v Speaker 1>second of their life that they can't even move?</v>

15
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:53.721
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

16
00:00:53.721 --> 00:00:56.990
<v Speaker 1>And you all laugh because you understand that it's like anxiety.</v>

17
00:00:56.991 --> 00:00:57.980
<v Speaker 1>That's no mystery.</v>

18
00:00:57.981 --> 00:01:01.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like brief spells of calm.</v>

19
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.140
<v Speaker 1>That's a mystery.</v>

20
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:06.643
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

21
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.300
<v Speaker 1>Client will come to me and say,</v>

22
00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:09.080
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

23
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm procrastinating.</v>

24
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.230
<v Speaker 1>Why do I procrastinate?</v>

25
00:01:12.231 --> 00:01:12.950
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

26
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:13.341
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

27
00:01:13.341 --> 00:01:14.570
<v Speaker 1>that's a stupid question.</v>

28
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.840
<v Speaker 1>It's easy just to sit there and do nothing.</v>

29
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.880
<v Speaker 1>What's the mystery is why you ever get up and do anything difficult at all?</v>

30
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.830
<v Speaker 1>Procrastination is the default.</v>

31
00:01:24.831 --> 00:01:27.140
<v Speaker 1>And psychologists ask,</v>

32
00:01:27.141 --> 00:01:27.921
<v Speaker 1>doctors ask,</v>

33
00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:28.340
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

34
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.110
<v Speaker 1>why do people take cocaine?</v>

35
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.010
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

36
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.843
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

37
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.843
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

38
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.640
<v Speaker 1>It's the wrong question.</v>

39
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.811
<v Speaker 1>The right quest.</v>

40
00:01:39.811 --> 00:01:40.644
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

41
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.230
<v Speaker 1>Why not like an addicted rat?</v>

42
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.770
<v Speaker 1>Don't you just take cocaine all the time until you die.</v>

43
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.190
<v Speaker 1>That's the quest.</v>

44
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.480
<v Speaker 1>And this question about meaning is like that too.</v>

45
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.940
<v Speaker 1>Is there meaning in life?</v>

46
00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.280
<v Speaker 1>That's a stupid question.</v>

47
00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.890
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

48
00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:00.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

49
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm serious about that.</v>

50
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.030
<v Speaker 1>That's not a question you ever ask yourself if you're in pain,</v>

51
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

52
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.180
<v Speaker 1>Because when you're in pain,</v>

53
00:02:08.181 --> 00:02:09.590
<v Speaker 1>you know that life has a meaning.</v>

54
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.270
<v Speaker 1>It's the pain and you can't argue yourself out of that meeting.</v>

55
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.230
<v Speaker 1>And so when we're asking whether or not life has meaning,</v>

56
00:02:18.231 --> 00:02:19.370
<v Speaker 1>that isn't what we mean.</v>

57
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.200
<v Speaker 1>What we mean is in the face of life's pain and suffering,</v>

58
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.780
<v Speaker 1>does life have any positive meaning?</v>

59
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.630
<v Speaker 1>And that is not the same question.</v>

60
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.203
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

61
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.680
<v Speaker 1>when you leave that aside for a minute,</v>

62
00:02:33.681 --> 00:02:36.860
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to tell you a little story,</v>

63
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.330
<v Speaker 1>a little experiment.</v>

64
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.930
<v Speaker 1>I remember in 1989 when the Berlin wall fell down,</v>

65
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.880
<v Speaker 1>there was a great celebration in Berlin and the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra</v>

66
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:55.210
<v Speaker 1>played a part in it and they came out to a section of the wall that had been</v>

67
00:02:55.431 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>knocked down where there was a huge crowd and played ninth.</v>

68
00:02:59.981 --> 00:03:01.780
<v Speaker 1>And I remember watching that,</v>

69
00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:03.700
<v Speaker 1>the great third movement,</v>

70
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.740
<v Speaker 1>the triumphant third movement,</v>

71
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.690
<v Speaker 1>and it was so wonderful to see everyone there and here this orchestra</v>

72
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.360
<v Speaker 1>playing those unbelievably remarkable notes in triumph that this horror show had</v>

73
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.030
<v Speaker 1>finally come to a halt.</v>

74
00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.220
<v Speaker 1>You can imagine someone</v>

75
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.870
<v Speaker 1>critically minded and rational and an event like that standing behind you as</v>

76
00:03:31.391 --> 00:03:36.370
<v Speaker 1>you're listening to the great strains of that symphony manifest themselves,</v>

77
00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.290
<v Speaker 1>tap you on the shoulder and say,</v>

78
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.253
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

79
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.843
<v Speaker 2>you know</v>

80
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.360
<v Speaker 1>that's symphony is going to end.</v>

81
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.930
<v Speaker 1>What makes you think it has any meaning at all?</v>

82
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:50.241
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

83
00:03:50.241 --> 00:03:50.840
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

84
00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.180
<v Speaker 1>how do you respond to something like that?</v>

85
00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:59.020
<v Speaker 1>You say you should reconsider the way you're looking at the world,</v>

86
00:03:59.421 --> 00:04:00.254
<v Speaker 1>their buddy,</v>

87
00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.190
<v Speaker 1>because that's just not the right answer.</v>

88
00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.500
<v Speaker 1>It's just not the right question.</v>

89
00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.270
<v Speaker 1>It's like the symphony has no meaning because it ends well.</v>

90
00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.580
<v Speaker 1>You're not paying attention to what's going on.</v>

91
00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.230
<v Speaker 1>If that's the way you think or maybe you're thinking too much.</v>

92
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.770
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

93
00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:22.220
<v Speaker 1>you're thinking too much and not paying enough attention and that is more</v>

94
00:04:22.221 --> 00:04:26.060
<v Speaker 1>serious than that and this ties in the issue of pain.</v>

95
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.300
<v Speaker 1>Say What does it all matter?</v>

96
00:04:29.301 --> 00:04:33.770
<v Speaker 1>If in 10 billion years the earth is going to fall into or this sun is going to</v>

97
00:04:33.771 --> 00:04:36.080
<v Speaker 1>expand and consume the earth,</v>

98
00:04:36.081 --> 00:04:37.400
<v Speaker 1>what difference does it make?</v>

99
00:04:37.401 --> 00:04:38.234
<v Speaker 1>And I would say,</v>

100
00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:39.583
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

101
00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.190
<v Speaker 1>is that that kind of answer you're going to give to a child that's in pain?</v>

102
00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.020
<v Speaker 1>That's your answer.</v>

103
00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:46.730
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

104
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:47.570
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

105
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:49.520
<v Speaker 1>you've got the flu.</v>

106
00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.081
<v Speaker 1>You're anxious,</v>

107
00:04:51.081 --> 00:04:52.160
<v Speaker 1>you're having a nightmare.</v>

108
00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.130
<v Speaker 1>You're in terrible pain,</v>

109
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.620
<v Speaker 1>but in 10 million years,</v>

110
00:04:57.621 --> 00:04:59.540
<v Speaker 1>who the hell is going to know the difference?</v>

111
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.901
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

112
00:05:02.901 --> 00:05:03.261
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

113
00:05:03.261 --> 00:05:03.890
<v Speaker 1>No kidding.</v>

114
00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:05.270
<v Speaker 1>It's like you don't.</v>

115
00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:09.323
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

116
00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:10.410
<v Speaker 1>If the question is,</v>

117
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.680
<v Speaker 1>if that response is observed in that situation,</v>

118
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.390
<v Speaker 1>then it's an absurd response.</v>

119
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.900
<v Speaker 1>The mere fact that you can come up with a timeframe across which your current</v>

120
00:05:21.031 --> 00:05:26.031
<v Speaker 1>activity is meaningless only means that you're capable of playing with meanings</v>

121
00:05:26.551 --> 00:05:27.720
<v Speaker 1>across timeframes.</v>

122
00:05:27.721 --> 00:05:29.730
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean anything at all about meaning.</v>

123
00:05:29.731 --> 00:05:30.660
<v Speaker 1>As far as I can tell,</v>

124
00:05:30.661 --> 00:05:35.220
<v Speaker 1>is it absolutely obligatory that everything that's meaningful has to be</v>

125
00:05:35.221 --> 00:05:39.030
<v Speaker 1>significant in some unimaginable distant future?</v>

126
00:05:39.031 --> 00:05:40.350
<v Speaker 1>Why is that the hallmark?</v>

127
00:05:40.351 --> 00:05:41.310
<v Speaker 1>Why would you just say,</v>

128
00:05:41.311 --> 00:05:41.461
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

129
00:05:41.461 --> 00:05:42.294
<v Speaker 1>here's an idea.</v>

130
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.460
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you stop conceptualizing your life across tight timeframes that takes</v>

131
00:05:47.461 --> 00:05:49.350
<v Speaker 1>all the positive meaning out of them.</v>

132
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.570
<v Speaker 1>How would that be for his suggestion?</v>

133
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:56.750
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the fact that posing the question in that way makes you feel miserable and</v>

134
00:05:57.831 --> 00:06:02.750
<v Speaker 1>wretched and few tile is an indication that there's something wrong with posing</v>

135
00:06:02.751 --> 00:06:04.250
<v Speaker 1>the question in that manner.</v>

136
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:05.091
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>

137
00:06:05.091 --> 00:06:05.271
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

138
00:06:05.271 --> 00:06:07.100
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing wrong with posing questions.</v>

139
00:06:07.101 --> 00:06:07.581
<v Speaker 1>And I would say,</v>

140
00:06:07.581 --> 00:06:11.060
<v Speaker 1>well that brings us back to the child in pain problem.</v>

141
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.800
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes there is a problem with posing questions in a certain way and what</v>

142
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.760
<v Speaker 1>difference is it gonna make in 10 million years is not a sufficient</v>

143
00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.100
<v Speaker 1>response to someone who's suffering.</v>

144
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:28.571
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>

145
00:06:28.571 --> 00:06:28.781
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

146
00:06:28.781 --> 00:06:29.500
<v Speaker 1>we could,</v>

147
00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.180
<v Speaker 1>we could expand that idea.</v>

148
00:06:31.181 --> 00:06:34.270
<v Speaker 1>Even we could take play with that idea of suffering.</v>

149
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:35.531
<v Speaker 1>We could say,</v>

150
00:06:35.531 --> 00:06:36.364
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

151
00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.440
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's a child in Auschwitz,</v>

152
00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:39.303
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

153
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.780
<v Speaker 1>and this suffering isn't merely a consequence of an illness.</v>

154
00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:45.910
<v Speaker 1>Not that that's trivial,</v>

155
00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.350
<v Speaker 1>but the suffering is the consequence of conscious malevolent.</v>

156
00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:51.850
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>

157
00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.810
<v Speaker 1>And the purpose of the malevolence is just to make things worse.</v>

158
00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:56.410
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

159
00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:59.920
<v Speaker 1>and to top it all off because malevolence is a form of art.</v>

160
00:06:59.921 --> 00:07:01.780
<v Speaker 1>It's not only to make things worse,</v>

161
00:07:01.781 --> 00:07:05.170
<v Speaker 1>it's to make things worse in the worst possible imaginable way,</v>

162
00:07:05.171 --> 00:07:10.171
<v Speaker 1>which is basically to amplify this suffering of someone maximumly innocent in</v>

163
00:07:10.961 --> 00:07:13.270
<v Speaker 1>the most pointless way possible.</v>

164
00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:15.611
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

165
00:07:15.611 --> 00:07:16.060
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

166
00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.380
<v Speaker 1>what's your answer to that?</v>

167
00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:18.423
<v Speaker 1>It's like</v>

168
00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:21.800
<v Speaker 1>10 million years.</v>

169
00:07:21.801 --> 00:07:23.060
<v Speaker 1>What difference is it going to make?</v>

170
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:25.700
<v Speaker 1>Life is fundamentally meaningless.</v>

171
00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:27.680
<v Speaker 1>It's like what kind of answers that</v>

172
00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:32.820
<v Speaker 1>it's an answer that shows that the framework within which that question is</v>

173
00:07:32.821 --> 00:07:34.230
<v Speaker 1>generated is invalid.</v>

174
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.660
<v Speaker 1>That's what kind of answer it is.</v>

175
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:44.910
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

176
00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:49.440
<v Speaker 1>I realized a while back that I had gone through a process when I was in my</v>

177
00:07:49.441 --> 00:07:50.274
<v Speaker 1>twenties.</v>

178
00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:54.370
<v Speaker 1>It was akin to something Descartes did.</v>

179
00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:57.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to compare myself to Descartes.</v>

180
00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:58.323
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

181
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:00.333
<v Speaker 1>but he was,</v>

182
00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:05.340
<v Speaker 1>he was trying to look for something that he couldn't doubt and the consequence</v>

183
00:08:05.711 --> 00:08:06.820
<v Speaker 1>of his search was,</v>

184
00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:09.660
<v Speaker 1>I think therefore I am,</v>

185
00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:14.210
<v Speaker 1>which I don't think is exactly a good translation of what Descartes meant.</v>

186
00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:18.480
<v Speaker 1>I think he meant something more like I can't dispute the reality of my own</v>

187
00:08:18.481 --> 00:08:19.320
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

188
00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:20.580
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>

189
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:21.833
<v Speaker 1>And that's good.</v>

190
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:26.520
<v Speaker 1>That isn't where I got to in my contemplations.</v>

191
00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:32.540
<v Speaker 1>I was looking for something that I regarded as in controvertible and I was</v>

192
00:08:34.231 --> 00:08:37.450
<v Speaker 1>fortunate at that time because I was reading Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn,</v>

193
00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:39.090
<v Speaker 1>Solzhenitsyn Road,</v>

194
00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.760
<v Speaker 1>the Gulag archipelago among many other things.</v>

195
00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:46.950
<v Speaker 1>The Gulag archipelago is a description of the absolute catastrophes of the</v>

196
00:08:46.951 --> 00:08:51.951
<v Speaker 1>Soviet state and the entanglement of the individual psyches of the Soviet</v>

197
00:08:53.101 --> 00:08:58.101
<v Speaker 1>citizens in that catastrophe descent into deceit and cruelty to seat resentment</v>

198
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.850
<v Speaker 1>and cruelty when Solzhenitsyn,</v>

199
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:07.470
<v Speaker 1>the Gulag archipelago that he thought the Nuremberg trials were the most</v>

200
00:09:07.471 --> 00:09:09.990
<v Speaker 1>important event of the 20th century.</v>

201
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:11.880
<v Speaker 1>And the reason he said that</v>

202
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:19.430
<v Speaker 1>was because the Nuremberg judgment for better or worse,</v>

203
00:09:19.501 --> 00:09:24.501
<v Speaker 1>was that there were some acts that were so viciously brutal that there was no</v>

204
00:09:26.581 --> 00:09:29.760
<v Speaker 1>excuse whatsoever for engaging in them,</v>

205
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:34.940
<v Speaker 1>no matter who you were or what your culture was or what your rationale was.</v>

206
00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:36.203
<v Speaker 1>And so for,</v>

207
00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:36.811
<v Speaker 1>for soldier,</v>

208
00:09:36.811 --> 00:09:37.644
<v Speaker 1>an incident,</v>

209
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:45.320
<v Speaker 1>the Nuremberg trials established what you might describe as the transcendent</v>

210
00:09:46.171 --> 00:09:47.460
<v Speaker 1>reality of evil.</v>

211
00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.670
<v Speaker 1>And that's an unbelievably useful thing.</v>

212
00:09:50.671 --> 00:09:55.500
<v Speaker 1>It's akin to this idea of suffering in my estimation because,</v>

213
00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:58.171
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

214
00:09:58.171 --> 00:10:01.770
<v Speaker 1>it's the child in there in Auschwitz problem that</v>

215
00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:04.960
<v Speaker 1>you need an answer</v>

216
00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:10.690
<v Speaker 1>to the problem posed by the suffering of innocence</v>

217
00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:14.260
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence of malevolent.</v>

218
00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:15.843
<v Speaker 1>You say that's,</v>

219
00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:17.600
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

220
00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.433
<v Speaker 1>that's evil.</v>

221
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:24.200
<v Speaker 1>The conscious exaggeration of unnecessary suffering and that gives you a vantage</v>

222
00:10:25.181 --> 00:10:26.920
<v Speaker 1>point that's wrong.</v>

223
00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.020
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it is that is,</v>

224
00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:30.550
<v Speaker 1>that's wrong.</v>

225
00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.460
<v Speaker 2>Well then you have</v>

226
00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.350
<v Speaker 1>a place to stand.</v>

227
00:10:36.351 --> 00:10:36.861
<v Speaker 1>You can say,</v>

228
00:10:36.861 --> 00:10:37.160
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

229
00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:37.491
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

230
00:10:37.491 --> 00:10:42.491
<v Speaker 1>now I know that there's something that's wrong and now non trivial way in a way</v>

231
00:10:42.561 --> 00:10:44.420
<v Speaker 1>that tech can't be just dispensed with,</v>

232
00:10:44.421 --> 00:10:47.270
<v Speaker 1>with rational objections</v>

233
00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:53.700
<v Speaker 1>that emerge as a consequence of contemplation of the boundedness of life.</v>

234
00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:59.430
<v Speaker 1>Those answers aren't serious enough to address the issue.</v>

235
00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.513
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>

236
00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:04.721
<v Speaker 1>So I thought,</v>

237
00:11:04.721 --> 00:11:05.021
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

238
00:11:05.021 --> 00:11:06.880
<v Speaker 1>well I found something that I can</v>

239
00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:12.130
<v Speaker 1>grip onto or stand on without dispute.</v>

240
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
<v Speaker 1>There are acts that are unquestionably evil and that means that there are acts</v>

241
00:11:18.371 --> 00:11:19.720
<v Speaker 1>that are unquestionably good.</v>

242
00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:20.921
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

243
00:11:20.921 --> 00:11:23.230
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean that we know what they are,</v>

244
00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:23.951
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

245
00:11:23.951 --> 00:11:26.350
<v Speaker 1>Because just because you know one pole of something,</v>

246
00:11:26.351 --> 00:11:27.800
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't necessarily mean you know.</v>

247
00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:28.420
<v Speaker 1>The other.</v>

248
00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:33.420
<v Speaker 1>I could say that whatever leads us as far as way as we can possibly get from</v>

249
00:11:34.421 --> 00:11:35.470
<v Speaker 1>Auschwitz,</v>

250
00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:37.330
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>

251
00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:39.473
<v Speaker 2>Well</v>

252
00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:44.830
<v Speaker 1>are being turned to puzzle out what that might be for 25 years.</v>

253
00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:48.130
<v Speaker 1>To outline it in a practical manner,</v>

254
00:11:48.131 --> 00:11:50.200
<v Speaker 1>I suppose in an abstract manner,</v>

255
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:55.420
<v Speaker 1>to understand if there's a root,</v>

256
00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:57.850
<v Speaker 1>a mode of being,</v>

257
00:11:57.851 --> 00:12:01.900
<v Speaker 1>let's say that takes us away from undue suffering,</v>

258
00:12:01.901 --> 00:12:06.901
<v Speaker 1>but more than that takes us away from undue suffering multiplied by malevolence.</v>

259
00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:12.460
<v Speaker 1>He said it's a fundamental existential problem of life.</v>

260
00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:13.900
<v Speaker 1>We all suffer.</v>

261
00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:15.190
<v Speaker 1>That's the meaning of life.</v>

262
00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:16.143
<v Speaker 1>We all suffer.</v>

263
00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:21.210
<v Speaker 1>The suffering is exacerbated by the malevolence in our hearts and the</v>

264
00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:23.800
<v Speaker 1>malevolence in the hearts of all of us</v>

265
00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:31.120
<v Speaker 1>and the paramount issue that faces us is what to do about that,</v>

266
00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:37.070
<v Speaker 1>and the answer is I think</v>

267
00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:43.730
<v Speaker 1>live a life that manifests itself as meaningful because it seems to me that the</v>

268
00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.860
<v Speaker 1>meaning isn't a rational phenomena.</v>

269
00:12:49.861 --> 00:12:51.870
<v Speaker 1>It's not something that you create.</v>

270
00:12:51.871 --> 00:12:52.980
<v Speaker 1>This is where Nietzsche,</v>

271
00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:54.510
<v Speaker 1>I think got it wrong.</v>

272
00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:57.260
<v Speaker 1>He believed that as a consequence of the death of God we had,</v>

273
00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:58.740
<v Speaker 1>we would have to create our own values.</v>

274
00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:00.990
<v Speaker 1>We would have to become gods ourselves,</v>

275
00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:01.830
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

276
00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:02.663
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

277
00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.280
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think that Nisha was right because I don't think that we can create</v>

278
00:13:07.281 --> 00:13:07.881
<v Speaker 1>our own values.</v>

279
00:13:07.881 --> 00:13:09.410
<v Speaker 1>I think that we have to discover them.</v>

280
00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:11.900
<v Speaker 1>And I think that what we discover,</v>

281
00:13:11.901 --> 00:13:13.430
<v Speaker 1>our eternal values,</v>

282
00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:18.200
<v Speaker 1>and I think that the eternal values that are discoverable are precisely the</v>

283
00:13:18.201 --> 00:13:21.470
<v Speaker 1>values that lead us away from the pathway to perdition.</v>

284
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:24.680
<v Speaker 1>It was characterized by places such as Auschwitz.</v>

285
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:27.890
<v Speaker 1>And I also think that we all know this now.</v>

286
00:13:27.891 --> 00:13:31.040
<v Speaker 1>It's not that we can't question it because we can question it,</v>

287
00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:34.400
<v Speaker 1>but the questioning is in some sense,</v>

288
00:13:34.401 --> 00:13:35.211
<v Speaker 1>beside the point,</v>

289
00:13:35.211 --> 00:13:40.211
<v Speaker 1>like the person objecting to the Grand Juror grandier of Beethoven's ninth by</v>

290
00:13:42.531 --> 00:13:44.390
<v Speaker 1>pointing out that it's going to end.</v>

291
00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.970
<v Speaker 1>The questioning is beside the point.</v>

292
00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:48.500
<v Speaker 1>It's missing the point.</v>

293
00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:55.430
<v Speaker 1>I've studied a variety of great psychologists,</v>

294
00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:58.190
<v Speaker 1>John Piaget and Carl Young and,</v>

295
00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:03.850
<v Speaker 1>and Freud and Carl Rogers,</v>

296
00:14:03.851 --> 00:14:06.160
<v Speaker 1>many of the great 20th century clinicians.</v>

297
00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:07.583
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

298
00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:17.420
<v Speaker 1>and my stance is that along with the biologists and the evolutionary</v>

299
00:14:17.891 --> 00:14:18.880
<v Speaker 1>psychologists that were,</v>

300
00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:24.390
<v Speaker 1>we're starting to map out the pathway that might be the opposite of the</v>

301
00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:31.200
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic motive being that leads us into pits of hell like Auschwitz.</v>

302
00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:34.660
<v Speaker 1>And that there's something genuinely real about it.</v>

303
00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:36.190
<v Speaker 1>Like seriously,</v>

304
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:37.623
<v Speaker 1>real,</v>

305
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:39.310
<v Speaker 1>metaphorically real,</v>

306
00:14:39.311 --> 00:14:40.540
<v Speaker 1>and literally real,</v>

307
00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:45.110
<v Speaker 1>both at the same time that the instinct to meaning that you experience,</v>

308
00:14:45.111 --> 00:14:45.581
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

309
00:14:45.581 --> 00:14:47.110
<v Speaker 1>when you listen to something great,</v>

310
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:47.750
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

311
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:48.160
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

312
00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:53.020
<v Speaker 1>that experience of meaning that overcomes you isn't some EPR phenomena.</v>

313
00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:54.230
<v Speaker 1>It's not something,</v>

314
00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:58.730
<v Speaker 1>some mirror reflection of some more fundamental process,</v>

315
00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:03.470
<v Speaker 1>but that which is more fundamental than anything else</v>

316
00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:06.221
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

317
00:15:06.221 --> 00:15:06.790
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

318
00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:11.790
<v Speaker 1>you can't deny that pain is real and suffering is real and you can't deny that</v>

319
00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:18.270
<v Speaker 1>suffering induced by malevolence is the worst of all possible sufferings.</v>

320
00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:21.490
<v Speaker 1>Those are all undeniable as far as I'm concerned.</v>

321
00:15:21.491 --> 00:15:26.491
<v Speaker 1>Those are all meanings of life and the real enough so that if you encounter</v>

322
00:15:26.951 --> 00:15:27.161
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

323
00:15:27.161 --> 00:15:28.960
<v Speaker 1>like if you encounter true malevolence,</v>

324
00:15:28.961 --> 00:15:31.930
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you'll walk away from it and escape this is very,</v>

325
00:15:31.931 --> 00:15:32.764
<v Speaker 1>very low.</v>

326
00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:36.850
<v Speaker 1>It will damage you psychophysiological and you might never recover.</v>

327
00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.010
<v Speaker 1>And that's real enough for me.</v>

328
00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:42.763
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

329
00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:44.001
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

330
00:15:44.001 --> 00:15:45.620
<v Speaker 1>The path away from that real</v>

331
00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:49.670
<v Speaker 1>is the path that transcends that real.</v>

332
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:51.110
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's more real.</v>

333
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:56.030
<v Speaker 1>That's what I've come to believe as pessimistic as I am about the nature of</v>

334
00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:57.380
<v Speaker 1>humanity,</v>

335
00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:58.880
<v Speaker 1>myself included,</v>

336
00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:01.420
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

337
00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:01.710
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

338
00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:05.250
<v Speaker 1>as real as I believe suffering and evil to be.</v>

339
00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:10.980
<v Speaker 1>It appears to me that the mode of being that leads you away from that,</v>

340
00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:16.880
<v Speaker 1>that enables you to bear the suffering with nobility and to be useful to others</v>

341
00:16:17.131 --> 00:16:22.131
<v Speaker 1>who are in pain and to constrain the malevolence in your own heart and around</v>

342
00:16:22.321 --> 00:16:23.010
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

343
00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:28.010
<v Speaker 1>That that mode of being is more powerful than that which it is set against.</v>

344
00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:30.091
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>

345
00:16:30.091 --> 00:16:31.920
<v Speaker 1>I think that we experienced this.</v>

346
00:16:31.921 --> 00:16:32.910
<v Speaker 1>I think we experienced it.</v>

347
00:16:32.911 --> 00:16:34.290
<v Speaker 1>We just don't notice.</v>

348
00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:38.580
<v Speaker 1>Maybe because we're too busy thinking because noticing and thinking aren't the</v>

349
00:16:38.581 --> 00:16:43.581
<v Speaker 1>same thing we see in our own lives when we're engaged in something deeply</v>

350
00:16:44.071 --> 00:16:44.640
<v Speaker 1>meaningful.</v>

351
00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.290
<v Speaker 1>Music is the best pathway to that.</v>

352
00:16:46.291 --> 00:16:47.670
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the most,</v>

353
00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:50.700
<v Speaker 1>it's the most rapid and indisputable pathway to that.</v>

354
00:16:50.701 --> 00:16:51.211
<v Speaker 1>Everyone,</v>

355
00:16:51.211 --> 00:16:54.660
<v Speaker 1>virtually everyone loves music and music speaks of meaning.</v>

356
00:16:55.660 --> 00:17:00.060
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't directly and it shows you what life would be like if it was ordered</v>

357
00:17:00.061 --> 00:17:03.450
<v Speaker 1>and harmonious and you were dancing along with it properly.</v>

358
00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:08.720
<v Speaker 1>It gives you an intimation of psychological integrity,</v>

359
00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:12.990
<v Speaker 1>but you watched your lives day to day,</v>

360
00:17:12.991 --> 00:17:13.561
<v Speaker 1>week to week,</v>

361
00:17:13.561 --> 00:17:14.101
<v Speaker 1>month to month.</v>

362
00:17:14.101 --> 00:17:17.550
<v Speaker 1>You'll notice that there are times when you're so deeply engaged in what you're</v>

363
00:17:17.551 --> 00:17:18.210
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

364
00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:23.210
<v Speaker 1>What you're doing is so meaningful in the kind of meaning that announces itself,</v>

365
00:17:23.731 --> 00:17:25.140
<v Speaker 1>not the kind that you're creating,</v>

366
00:17:25.141 --> 00:17:26.580
<v Speaker 1>that life is so meaningful.</v>

367
00:17:26.581 --> 00:17:27.414
<v Speaker 1>You think</v>

368
00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:30.840
<v Speaker 1>this is worth the suffering.</v>

369
00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:33.201
<v Speaker 1>Let me think.</v>

370
00:17:33.201 --> 00:17:34.130
<v Speaker 1>Well that's meaning,</v>

371
00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:35.413
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

372
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.270
<v Speaker 1>Meaning is what makes the suffering worthwhile.</v>

373
00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:39.890
<v Speaker 1>Is that real?</v>

374
00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:42.170
<v Speaker 1>It's not something you think up.</v>

375
00:17:42.171 --> 00:17:45.650
<v Speaker 1>It's something that you discover and you can watch.</v>

376
00:17:45.651 --> 00:17:47.570
<v Speaker 1>You could see day to day,</v>

377
00:17:47.571 --> 00:17:49.260
<v Speaker 1>minute to minute,</v>

378
00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:49.980
<v Speaker 1>hour to hour,</v>

379
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:50.813
<v Speaker 1>week to week.</v>

380
00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:55.970
<v Speaker 1>You can see when you're conducting yourself or being conducted in a manner that</v>

381
00:17:56.341 --> 00:18:01.140
<v Speaker 1>allows that meaning to reveal itself in a way that in the moment,</v>

382
00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.130
<v Speaker 1>even if you don't notice the conditions of your life,</v>

383
00:18:05.131 --> 00:18:07.140
<v Speaker 1>justify themselves and,</v>

384
00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:12.210
<v Speaker 1>and that's really saying something because pain and suffering and malevolence or</v>

385
00:18:12.211 --> 00:18:17.211
<v Speaker 1>real and for something to justify that it's really something for something to</v>

386
00:18:19.171 --> 00:18:20.190
<v Speaker 1>justify that.</v>

387
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:23.010
<v Speaker 1>But will you find that you find it in art,</v>

388
00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.060
<v Speaker 1>you find it in literature,</v>

389
00:18:24.061 --> 00:18:27.000
<v Speaker 1>you find it in the relationships you have with others.</v>

390
00:18:27.001 --> 00:18:30.330
<v Speaker 1>If those relationships are founded on trust and truth,</v>

391
00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:33.570
<v Speaker 1>you find it in what you say and do.</v>

392
00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:35.880
<v Speaker 1>If what you say and do comes from the heart,</v>

393
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:38.610
<v Speaker 1>you can experience that.</v>

394
00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:43.900
<v Speaker 1>The price of experiencing it,</v>

395
00:18:43.901 --> 00:18:45.280
<v Speaker 1>I would say is two fold.</v>

396
00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:49.570
<v Speaker 1>You have to take responsibility for being,</v>

397
00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:54.140
<v Speaker 1>you have to do that voluntarily and that means that you have to take</v>

398
00:18:54.141 --> 00:18:59.141
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for the suffering of being an excepted and work to ameliorate it.</v>

399
00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:01.820
<v Speaker 1>And you have to do that voluntarily.</v>

400
00:19:01.821 --> 00:19:03.410
<v Speaker 1>And that's a barrier,</v>

401
00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:06.920
<v Speaker 1>I think very frequently that arguments like,</v>

402
00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:07.491
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

403
00:19:07.491 --> 00:19:12.491
<v Speaker 1>what difference is it going to make 10 million years in the future aren't hyper</v>

404
00:19:12.891 --> 00:19:16.760
<v Speaker 1>rational objections to the nature of being itself,</v>

405
00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:22.240
<v Speaker 1>but hyper rationalistic excuses for failing to bear the responsibility of living</v>

406
00:19:24.711 --> 00:19:25.311
<v Speaker 1>properly,</v>

407
00:19:25.311 --> 00:19:26.240
<v Speaker 1>moment to moment,</v>

408
00:19:26.241 --> 00:19:28.400
<v Speaker 1>and our tower there.</v>

409
00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:34.983
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

410
00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:38.540
<v Speaker 1>say you have a child who's sick,</v>

411
00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:40.100
<v Speaker 1>maybe one who's been hurt.</v>

412
00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:41.601
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

413
00:19:41.601 --> 00:19:42.434
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

414
00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:45.050
<v Speaker 1>what do you say or do in the face of that?</v>

415
00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:47.863
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

416
00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.033
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

417
00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.193
<v Speaker 2>Hey kid,</v>

418
00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:54.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm here with you.</v>

419
00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:57.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm here beside you.</v>

420
00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:05.270
<v Speaker 1>Matters what's happening to you and where to do everything we possibly can to</v>

421
00:20:07.351 --> 00:20:09.810
<v Speaker 1>get through this together.</v>

422
00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:12.421
<v Speaker 1>And if you're lucky,</v>

423
00:20:12.421 --> 00:20:12.931
<v Speaker 1>you get a hug.</v>

424
00:20:12.931 --> 00:20:15.510
<v Speaker 1>And as a consequence of that and you think,</v>

425
00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:16.920
<v Speaker 1>if you don't think that's meaningful,</v>

426
00:20:16.921 --> 00:20:17.191
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

427
00:20:17.191 --> 00:20:20.790
<v Speaker 1>there's something wrong with your soul and answer.</v>

428
00:20:20.791 --> 00:20:23.400
