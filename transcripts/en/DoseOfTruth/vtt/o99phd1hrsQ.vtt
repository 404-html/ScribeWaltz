1
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.113
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

2
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:13.980
<v Speaker 1>you unite your mind,</v>

3
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:14.671
<v Speaker 1>you're thinking,</v>

4
00:00:14.671 --> 00:00:16.080
<v Speaker 1>let's say with your emotions.</v>

5
00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:19.620
<v Speaker 1>So that makes one thing instead of two fighting things.</v>

6
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:20.970
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

7
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:21.803
<v Speaker 1>that's a good one.</v>

8
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.400
<v Speaker 1>And then the next conjunction he talked about was it isn't enough to unite your</v>

9
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.380
<v Speaker 1>mind and your emotions.</v>

10
00:00:28.381 --> 00:00:31.380
<v Speaker 1>And he thought about that as a male female pairing symbolically.</v>

11
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.960
<v Speaker 1>That's how it would manifest itself sometimes in dreams.</v>

12
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.650
<v Speaker 1>So you take the masculine element and the feminine element,</v>

13
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.340
<v Speaker 1>the the thinking and the emotion unite those.</v>

14
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.200
<v Speaker 1>And that makes you more like one thing.</v>

15
00:00:43.201 --> 00:00:43.441
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

16
00:00:43.441 --> 00:00:46.050
<v Speaker 1>And now all of a sudden that's represented as symbolically mail.</v>

17
00:00:46.051 --> 00:00:49.350
<v Speaker 1>That one thing and it unites with something else that's now represented</v>

18
00:00:49.351 --> 00:00:49.891
<v Speaker 1>symbolically,</v>

19
00:00:49.891 --> 00:00:50.910
<v Speaker 1>seven female,</v>

20
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.990
<v Speaker 1>that's the body.</v>

21
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.820
<v Speaker 1>So you take the mind,</v>

22
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.180
<v Speaker 1>emotion integration and integrate that in your body.</v>

23
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.140
<v Speaker 1>So what does that mean?</v>

24
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.320
<v Speaker 1>You act it out instead of just thinking.</v>

25
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.050
<v Speaker 1>So there's this philosophical idea called a,</v>

26
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.280
<v Speaker 1>now I'm going to forget what it's called.</v>

27
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.320
<v Speaker 1>It's a contradiction in action.</v>

28
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.970
<v Speaker 1>There's actually a technical term for it,</v>

29
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.830
<v Speaker 1>but that's when you think and believe something,</v>

30
00:01:13.831 --> 00:01:14.340
<v Speaker 1>but you're,</v>

31
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.390
<v Speaker 1>but you don't act it out.</v>

32
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.370
<v Speaker 1>And so that means there is a dissociation in you somehow between your abstract</v>

33
00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:24.130
<v Speaker 1>representations and what you manifest in action.</v>

34
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.810
<v Speaker 1>While that's another form of discontinuity that isn't doing you any good.</v>

35
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.830
<v Speaker 1>You know the driver's going one way and the cars going the other and you won't</v>

36
00:01:31.831 --> 00:01:34.410
<v Speaker 1>even be able to understand yourself if you do that.</v>

37
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.431
<v Speaker 1>But even more,</v>

38
00:01:35.431 --> 00:01:38.770
<v Speaker 1>you're not putting your principles into practice so you're disassociated.</v>

39
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.470
<v Speaker 1>You're being is dissociated.</v>

40
00:01:40.471 --> 00:01:43.710
<v Speaker 1>So once you get your mind and your emotions working together,</v>

41
00:01:43.711 --> 00:01:46.410
<v Speaker 1>then the next thing to do is to act that out consistently.</v>

42
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.740
<v Speaker 1>So that was the second conjunction as far as young was concerned.</v>

43
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.180
<v Speaker 1>And then the third one was,</v>

44
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.510
<v Speaker 1>this is the tough one and this is the one that's related to phenomenology.</v>

45
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.800
<v Speaker 1>You erase the distinction between yourself and the world.</v>

46
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.043
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

47
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.400
<v Speaker 1>that's a tough one.</v>

48
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.860
<v Speaker 1>So imagine you're dealing with someone who's hoarding.</v>

49
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.941
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

50
00:02:05.941 --> 00:02:10.230
<v Speaker 1>people who are hoarding are often older or neurologically damaged or they have</v>

51
00:02:10.231 --> 00:02:11.700
<v Speaker 1>obsessive compulsive disorder.</v>

52
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.720
<v Speaker 1>But then you walk into their house and there's like 10,000 things in their</v>

53
00:02:15.721 --> 00:02:16.021
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

54
00:02:16.021 --> 00:02:16.680
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

55
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.230
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

56
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.640
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

57
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.970
<v Speaker 1>there's maybe a hundred boxes and you open up a box and in the box there's some</v>

58
00:02:20.971 --> 00:02:25.971
<v Speaker 1>pens and some old passports and some checks and their collection of silver</v>

59
00:02:26.071 --> 00:02:29.580
<v Speaker 1>dollars and some hypodermic needles and some Dustin,</v>

60
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.001
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

61
00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:31.170
<v Speaker 1>a dead mouse and,</v>

62
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.891
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

63
00:02:31.891 --> 00:02:35.820
<v Speaker 1>and there's boxes and boxes and boxes is like that in the house.</v>

64
00:02:35.821 --> 00:02:38.970
<v Speaker 1>It's absolute chaos in their absolute chaos,</v>

65
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.350
<v Speaker 1>not ordered chaos.</v>

66
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.860
<v Speaker 1>And then you think is that their houses that they're being,</v>

67
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.610
<v Speaker 1>is that their mind and answer is there's no difference.</v>

68
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.990
<v Speaker 1>There's no difference.</v>

69
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.651
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

70
00:02:49.651 --> 00:02:49.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

71
00:02:49.921 --> 00:02:50.431
<v Speaker 1>I could say,</v>

72
00:02:50.431 --> 00:02:50.611
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

73
00:02:50.611 --> 00:02:52.440
<v Speaker 1>if you want to organize your psyche,</v>

74
00:02:52.441 --> 00:02:55.440
<v Speaker 1>you could start by organizing your room if they've thought would be easier</v>

75
00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:58.620
<v Speaker 1>because maybe you're a more concrete person and you need something concrete to</v>

76
00:02:58.621 --> 00:02:59.410
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

77
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.070
<v Speaker 1>So you go clean up under your bed and you make your bed and you organize the</v>

78
00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:04.570
<v Speaker 1>papers on your desk and you think,</v>

79
00:03:04.571 --> 00:03:04.900
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

80
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.970
<v Speaker 1>just exactly what are you organizing?</v>

81
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.630
<v Speaker 1>Are you organizing the objective world or are you objecting your field?</v>

82
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.580
<v Speaker 1>Are you organizing your field of being like your field of total experience?</v>

83
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:17.470
<v Speaker 1>And young believed that.</v>

84
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.770
<v Speaker 1>And I think that there's a Buddhist doctrine that sort of nested in there that</v>

85
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.620
<v Speaker 1>at the highest level of psychological integration,</v>

86
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.310
<v Speaker 1>there's no difference between you and what you experience.</v>

87
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.601
<v Speaker 1>Now you think,</v>

88
00:03:28.601 --> 00:03:29.380
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

89
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.300
<v Speaker 1>I can't control everything I experienced,</v>

90
00:03:31.301 --> 00:03:34.590
<v Speaker 1>but that's no objection because you can't control yourself anyway.</v>

91
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.920
<v Speaker 1>So the mere fact that you can't extend control over everything you experience is</v>

92
00:03:38.921 --> 00:03:43.060
<v Speaker 1>no argument against the idea that you should still treat that as an extension of</v>

93
00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:43.894
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

94
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.441
<v Speaker 1>So you can say,</v>

95
00:03:44.441 --> 00:03:44.561
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

96
00:03:44.561 --> 00:03:49.561
<v Speaker 1>let's say you have a long standing feud with your brother while sat a</v>

97
00:03:50.081 --> 00:03:51.370
<v Speaker 1>psychological problem.</v>

98
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:52.241
<v Speaker 1>Is that him?</v>

99
00:03:52.241 --> 00:03:53.860
<v Speaker 1>Is it a problem in the objective world?</v>

100
00:03:53.861 --> 00:03:54.360
<v Speaker 1>Or is,</v>

101
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.770
<v Speaker 1>is it a problem in your field of being?</v>

102
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.370
<v Speaker 1>And it's very useful to think that way because you might ask,</v>

103
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.680
<v Speaker 1>what could you do to improve yourself?</v>

104
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

105
00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.320
<v Speaker 1>let's step one step backwards.</v>

106
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.550
<v Speaker 1>The first question might be,</v>

107
00:04:06.551 --> 00:04:08.980
<v Speaker 1>why should you even bother improving yourself?</v>

108
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.710
<v Speaker 1>And I think the answer to that is something like,</v>

109
00:04:11.711 --> 00:04:15.100
<v Speaker 1>so you don't suffer any more stupidly than you have to.</v>

110
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.500
<v Speaker 1>And maybe so others don't have to either.</v>

111
00:04:17.501 --> 00:04:18.640
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that,</v>

112
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:18.941
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

113
00:04:18.941 --> 00:04:20.980
<v Speaker 1>like there's a real injunction at the bottom of it.</v>

114
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.590
<v Speaker 1>It's not some casual self-help doctrine.</v>

115
00:04:23.591 --> 00:04:26.770
<v Speaker 1>It's that if you don't organize yourself properly,</v>

116
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.260
<v Speaker 1>you'll pay for it and in a big way.</v>

117
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.260
<v Speaker 1>And so will the people around you now and you could say,</v>

118
00:04:32.261 --> 00:04:33.460
<v Speaker 1>well I don't care about that,</v>

119
00:04:33.461 --> 00:04:34.690
<v Speaker 1>but that's actually not true.</v>

120
00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:37.330
<v Speaker 1>You actually do care about that because if you're in pain,</v>

121
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:38.740
<v Speaker 1>you will care about it.</v>

122
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.630
<v Speaker 1>And so you do care about it.</v>

123
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.520
<v Speaker 1>Even if it's just that negative way,</v>

124
00:04:42.521 --> 00:04:43.354
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

125
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.560
<v Speaker 1>it's very rare that you can find someone who's in excruciating pain who would</v>

126
00:04:47.561 --> 00:04:48.394
<v Speaker 1>ever say,</v>

127
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.421
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

128
00:04:49.421 --> 00:04:54.100
<v Speaker 1>it would be no better if I was out of this sort of pain is one of those things</v>

129
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.960
<v Speaker 1>that brings the idea that it would be better if it didn't exist along with it.</v>

130
00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:04.050
<v Speaker 1>It's in controvertible so you get your act together so that there isn't any more</v>

131
00:05:04.271 --> 00:05:06.460
<v Speaker 1>stupid pain around you than necessary.</v>

132
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.941
<v Speaker 1>We'll,</v>

133
00:05:06.941 --> 00:05:08.080
<v Speaker 1>so then the question might be,</v>

134
00:05:08.081 --> 00:05:10.150
<v Speaker 1>well how would you go about getting your act together?</v>

135
00:05:10.151 --> 00:05:11.230
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that.</v>

136
00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.360
<v Speaker 1>And this is a phenomenological idea too,</v>

137
00:05:13.361 --> 00:05:18.250
<v Speaker 1>it's something like look around for something that bothers you and see if you</v>

138
00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:19.084
<v Speaker 1>can fix it.</v>

139
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.250
<v Speaker 1>So now you think,</v>

140
00:05:21.251 --> 00:05:23.500
<v Speaker 1>well let's say there,</v>

141
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:24.640
<v Speaker 1>let's say you go into,</v>

142
00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:26.500
<v Speaker 1>you can do this in a room.</v>

143
00:05:26.501 --> 00:05:29.470
<v Speaker 1>It's quite fun to do it just when you're sitting in a room like a room,</v>

144
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.370
<v Speaker 1>maybe your bedroom,</v>

145
00:05:30.371 --> 00:05:32.710
<v Speaker 1>you can sit there and just sort of meditate on it and think,</v>

146
00:05:32.711 --> 00:05:33.280
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

147
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.330
<v Speaker 1>if I wanted to spend 10 minutes making this room better,</v>

148
00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.070
<v Speaker 1>what would I have to do?</v>

149
00:05:39.071 --> 00:05:40.540
<v Speaker 1>And you have to ask yourself that,</v>

150
00:05:40.541 --> 00:05:40.751
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

151
00:05:40.751 --> 00:05:41.650
<v Speaker 1>It's not a command.</v>

152
00:05:41.651 --> 00:05:45.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like our genuine question and things will pop out in the room that you know</v>

153
00:05:45.281 --> 00:05:48.520
<v Speaker 1>you like there's a stack of papers over there that's kind of bugging you and you</v>

154
00:05:48.521 --> 00:05:51.850
<v Speaker 1>know that maybe little order there would be a good thing and you know,</v>

155
00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:52.684
<v Speaker 1>you haven't,</v>

156
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.560
<v Speaker 1>there's some rubbish behind your computer monitor that you haven't attended to</v>

157
00:05:56.561 --> 00:05:57.590
<v Speaker 1>for like six months.</v>

158
00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.040
<v Speaker 1>And the room would be slightly better if it was a little less dusty and the</v>

159
00:06:01.041 --> 00:06:02.990
<v Speaker 1>cables weren't all tangled up the same way.</v>

160
00:06:02.991 --> 00:06:04.430
<v Speaker 1>And like if you,</v>

161
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.550
<v Speaker 1>if you allow yourself just to consider the expanse in which you exist at that</v>

162
00:06:11.001 --> 00:06:11.630
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>

163
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.350
<v Speaker 1>there'll be all sorts of things that'll pop out in it that you could just fix.</v>

164
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:16.851
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

165
00:06:16.851 --> 00:06:17.331
<v Speaker 1>I might say,</v>

166
00:06:17.331 --> 00:06:17.511
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

167
00:06:17.511 --> 00:06:19.910
<v Speaker 1>if you were coming to see me for psychotherapy,</v>

168
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.780
<v Speaker 1>this smell,</v>

169
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.260
<v Speaker 1>easiest thing for us to do first would just be to get you to organize your room.</v>

170
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:25.041
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>

171
00:06:25.041 --> 00:06:25.221
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

172
00:06:25.221 --> 00:06:26.420
<v Speaker 1>is that psychotherapy?</v>

173
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:27.441
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is,</v>

174
00:06:27.441 --> 00:06:27.741
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

175
00:06:27.741 --> 00:06:31.460
<v Speaker 1>it depends on how you conceive the limits of your being.</v>

176
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.840
<v Speaker 1>And I would say start where you can start.</v>

177
00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

178
00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:36.890
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

179
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.320
<v Speaker 1>if something announces itself to you,</v>

180
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.150
<v Speaker 1>which is a strange way of thinking about it,</v>

181
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.570
<v Speaker 1>as in need of repair that you could repair,</v>

182
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:45.800
<v Speaker 1>then hey,</v>

183
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:46.963
<v Speaker 1>fix it.</v>

184
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:48.830
<v Speaker 1>You fix a hundred things like that.</v>

185
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:50.990
<v Speaker 1>Your life will be a lot different.</v>

186
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:52.311
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

187
00:06:52.311 --> 00:06:56.570
<v Speaker 1>I often tell people to fix the things you repeat every day because people tend</v>

188
00:06:56.571 --> 00:06:57.860
<v Speaker 1>to think of those as trivial,</v>

189
00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:59.023
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

190
00:06:59.180 --> 00:06:59.930
<v Speaker 1>You get up,</v>

191
00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:00.860
<v Speaker 1>you brush your teeth,</v>

192
00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:02.210
<v Speaker 1>you have your breakfast,</v>

193
00:07:02.211 --> 00:07:02.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

194
00:07:02.511 --> 00:07:04.820
<v Speaker 1>you have your routines that you go through every day.</v>

195
00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.400
<v Speaker 1>Well though,</v>

196
00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.630
<v Speaker 1>those probably constitute 50% of your life.</v>

197
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:09.651
<v Speaker 1>And people think,</v>

198
00:07:09.651 --> 00:07:09.801
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

199
00:07:09.801 --> 00:07:10.461
<v Speaker 1>they're mundane,</v>

200
00:07:10.461 --> 00:07:11.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to pay attention to them.</v>

201
00:07:11.721 --> 00:07:12.051
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

202
00:07:12.051 --> 00:07:12.201
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

203
00:07:12.201 --> 00:07:12.381
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

204
00:07:12.381 --> 00:07:13.370
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly wrong.</v>

205
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:14.870
<v Speaker 1>The things you do every day,</v>

206
00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:18.590
<v Speaker 1>those are the most important things you do hands down.</v>

207
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.090
<v Speaker 1>All you have to do is do the arithmetic.</v>

208
00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:21.830
<v Speaker 1>You figure it out right away.</v>

209
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:27.040
<v Speaker 1>So a hundred adjustments to your broader domain of being and there's a lot less</v>

210
00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.380
<v Speaker 1>rubbish and there's a lot less rubbish around it,</v>

211
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:34.640
<v Speaker 1>a lot fewer traps for you to step into.</v>

212
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:40.360
<v Speaker 1>And so that's in keeping with Ewing's idea about erasing the dis.</v>

213
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:43.310
<v Speaker 1>Once you've got your mind and your emotions together,</v>

214
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.020
<v Speaker 1>and once you're acting that out,</v>

215
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:50.350
<v Speaker 1>then you can extend what you're willing to consider yourself and start fixing up</v>

216
00:07:51.081 --> 00:07:54.440
<v Speaker 1>the things that are part of your broader extent.</v>

217
00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:56.150
<v Speaker 1>Now sometimes you don't know how to do that.</v>

218
00:07:56.151 --> 00:07:57.020
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>

219
00:07:57.021 --> 00:08:00.620
<v Speaker 1>imagine you're walking down Bloor street and there's this guy who's like</v>

220
00:08:00.621 --> 00:08:03.410
<v Speaker 1>alcoholic and schizophrenia and has been on the streets for 10 years.</v>

221
00:08:03.411 --> 00:08:05.600
<v Speaker 1>He sorta stumbled towards you and you know,</v>

222
00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:07.310
<v Speaker 1>incoherently mutters something.</v>

223
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:08.900
<v Speaker 1>That's a problem.</v>

224
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:11.990
<v Speaker 1>And it would be good if you could fix it,</v>

225
00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:14.300
<v Speaker 1>but you haven't got a clue about how to fix that.</v>

226
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.680
<v Speaker 1>You just walk around that and go find something that you could fix.</v>

227
00:08:18.681 --> 00:08:20.210
<v Speaker 1>Because if you muck about in that,</v>

228
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:22.940
<v Speaker 1>not only is it unlikely that you'll help that person,</v>

229
00:08:22.941 --> 00:08:25.250
<v Speaker 1>it's very likely that you'll get hurt yourself.</v>

230
00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:26.391
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

231
00:08:26.391 --> 00:08:29.840
<v Speaker 1>just because while you're experiencing things,</v>

232
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:32.540
<v Speaker 1>announced themselves as in need of repair,</v>

233
00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:36.080
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean that it's you right that in there that should repair them.</v>

234
00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:37.790
<v Speaker 1>You have to have some humility.</v>

235
00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:38.630
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

236
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:41.750
<v Speaker 1>you don't walk up to a helicopter that isn't working and just start tinkering</v>

237
00:08:41.751 --> 00:08:42.584
<v Speaker 1>away with it.</v>

238
00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:43.000
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

239
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.170
<v Speaker 1>you have to stay within your domain of competence.</v>

240
00:08:45.171 --> 00:08:46.220
<v Speaker 1>But most of the time,</v>

241
00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:47.900
<v Speaker 1>if people look at their lives,</v>

242
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:49.303
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

243
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:51.470
<v Speaker 1>it's very interesting thing to do.</v>

244
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:52.311
<v Speaker 1>I liked the,</v>

245
00:08:52.311 --> 00:08:56.010
<v Speaker 1>I liked the idea of the room because you can do that at the drop of a hat.</v>

246
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:56.351
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

247
00:08:56.351 --> 00:08:58.350
<v Speaker 1>we'd go back to where you live and sit down and think,</v>

248
00:08:58.351 --> 00:08:59.184
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

249
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna make this place better for half an hour.</v>

250
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:02.790
<v Speaker 1>What should I do?</v>

251
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.530
<v Speaker 1>It you have to ask.</v>

252
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.620
<v Speaker 1>And things will just pop up like mad.</v>

253
00:09:07.621 --> 00:09:10.500
<v Speaker 1>And it's partly because your mind is a very strange thing.</v>

254
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:11.790
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you give it a name,</v>

255
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:13.410
<v Speaker 1>a genuine aim,</v>

256
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:16.440
<v Speaker 1>it'll reconfigure the world in keeping with that aim,</v>

257
00:09:16.441 --> 00:09:18.870
<v Speaker 1>that that's actually how you see to begin with.</v>

258
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.970
<v Speaker 1>And so if you said it a task,</v>

259
00:09:20.971 --> 00:09:22.830
<v Speaker 1>especially if you have to be genuine about it,</v>

260
00:09:22.831 --> 00:09:26.730
<v Speaker 1>which is why you have to bring your thoughts and emotions together,</v>

261
00:09:26.731 --> 00:09:28.350
<v Speaker 1>and then you have to get them into your body.</v>

262
00:09:28.351 --> 00:09:29.820
<v Speaker 1>So you're acting consistently,</v>

263
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:31.980
<v Speaker 1>you have to be genuine about the aim.</v>

264
00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:33.210
<v Speaker 1>But once you aim,</v>

265
00:09:33.211 --> 00:09:36.510
<v Speaker 1>the world will reconfigure itself around that aim,</v>

266
00:09:36.511 --> 00:09:37.830
<v Speaker 1>which is very strange.</v>

267
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:38.401
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

268
00:09:38.401 --> 00:09:39.570
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

269
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.020
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

270
00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.880
<v Speaker 1>it's technically true.</v>
