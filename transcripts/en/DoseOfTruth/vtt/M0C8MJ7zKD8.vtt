00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:05.230
<v Speaker 1>Why bother with this strange we'll book at all.</v>

2
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:06.873
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

3
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:10.790
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>

4
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.790
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:12.623
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.560
<v Speaker 1>it's a contradictory</v>

7
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.720
<v Speaker 1>document that's been cobbled together over thousands of years.</v>

8
00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:22.640
<v Speaker 1>It's outlasted kingdoms,</v>

9
00:00:22.641 --> 00:00:22.971
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

10
00:00:22.971 --> 00:00:23.781
<v Speaker 1>many kingdoms.</v>

11
00:00:23.781 --> 00:00:24.061
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

12
00:00:24.061 --> 00:00:24.330
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

13
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.530
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

14
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.310
<v Speaker 1>it's really interesting that it turns out that a book is more durable than,</v>

15
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.451
<v Speaker 1>than stone.</v>

16
00:00:29.451 --> 00:00:30.890
<v Speaker 1>It's more durable than a castle.</v>

17
00:00:30.891 --> 00:00:32.540
<v Speaker 1>It's more durable than an empire.</v>

18
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.400
<v Speaker 1>And that's really interesting.</v>

19
00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:34.641
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

20
00:00:34.641 --> 00:00:34.970
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

21
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.100
<v Speaker 1>that it's something in some sense,</v>

22
00:00:37.101 --> 00:00:40.640
<v Speaker 1>so evanescent can be so long living.</v>

23
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.920
<v Speaker 1>So there's that,</v>

24
00:00:42.921 --> 00:00:44.060
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of a mystery.</v>

25
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm approaching this whole scenario.</v>

26
00:00:47.961 --> 00:00:52.280
<v Speaker 1>This is the biblical stories as if they're a mystery fundamentally be,</v>

27
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.061
<v Speaker 1>because they are,</v>

28
00:00:53.061 --> 00:00:55.250
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot we don't understand about them.</v>

29
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.070
<v Speaker 1>We don't understand how they came about.</v>

30
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.280
<v Speaker 1>We don't really understand how they were put together.</v>

31
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.740
<v Speaker 1>We don't understand why they had such an unbelievable impact on civilization.</v>

32
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.800
<v Speaker 1>We don't understand how people could have believed them.</v>

33
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.310
<v Speaker 1>We don't understand what it means that we don't believe them now or,</v>

34
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.830
<v Speaker 1>or even what it would mean if we didn't believe them.</v>

35
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:16.743
<v Speaker 1>They're theirs.</v>

36
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.580
<v Speaker 1>And then on top of all that,</v>

37
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.500
<v Speaker 1>there's the additional problem,</v>

38
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.050
<v Speaker 1>which isn't specific to me,</v>

39
00:01:24.051 --> 00:01:28.400
<v Speaker 1>but it's certainly relevant to me that no matter how educated you are,</v>

40
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.020
<v Speaker 1>you're not educated enough to discuss the psychological significance of the</v>

41
00:01:33.021 --> 00:01:34.040
<v Speaker 1>biblical stories.</v>

42
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:35.200
<v Speaker 1>But I'm,</v>

43
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do my best and partly because I want to learn more about them.</v>

44
00:01:40.671 --> 00:01:45.560
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I've learned is that the best way to learn about something</v>

45
00:01:45.561 --> 00:01:46.820
<v Speaker 1>is to talk about it.</v>

46
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.920
<v Speaker 1>And when I'm lecturing,</v>

47
00:01:48.921 --> 00:01:49.754
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking,</v>

48
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:01:50.061 --> 00:01:50.201
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

50
00:01:50.201 --> 00:01:53.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to tell you what I know for sure to be the case,</v>

51
00:01:53.451 --> 00:01:56.840
<v Speaker 1>because there's lots of things I don't know for sure to be the case.</v>

52
00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to make sense out of this.</v>

53
00:01:58.761 --> 00:02:00.800
<v Speaker 1>And I have been doing this for a long time.</v>
