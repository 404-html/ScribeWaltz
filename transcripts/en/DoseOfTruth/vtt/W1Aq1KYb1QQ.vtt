00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.030
<v Speaker 1>What do wisdom have you acquired in the past few months that you want to share</v>

2
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:10.850
<v Speaker 1>with us?</v>

3
00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:11.031
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4
00:00:11.031 --> 00:00:11.721
<v Speaker 1>I've got one.</v>

5
00:00:11.721 --> 00:00:12.730
<v Speaker 1>I think I,</v>

6
00:00:12.731 --> 00:00:14.450
<v Speaker 1>I've thought thought of a bunch of new things,</v>

7
00:00:14.451 --> 00:00:16.040
<v Speaker 1>but this one I'm really happy with.</v>

8
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.343
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

9
00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.070
<v Speaker 1>I figured out why.</v>

10
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:20.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

11
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.880
<v Speaker 1>some of you know that there's a mythological trope that I discussed fairly</v>

12
00:00:25.881 --> 00:00:30.230
<v Speaker 1>frequently about rescuing your father from the belly of the dragon or the belly</v>

13
00:00:30.231 --> 00:00:31.064
<v Speaker 1>of the beast.</v>

14
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.790
<v Speaker 1>It's a motif that you see when you see it in the lion king.</v>

15
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

16
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.380
<v Speaker 1>you see it when Simba is being initiated by the baboons.</v>

17
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember Nephi Nitpicky,</v>

18
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:42.590
<v Speaker 1>I think his name is,</v>

19
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:43.550
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

20
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.110
<v Speaker 1>after Nela humiliates him because he's still a pathetic adolescent.</v>

21
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.780
<v Speaker 1>He follows the baboons.</v>

22
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.090
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a mandrill actually down underground,</v>

23
00:00:56.091 --> 00:00:57.620
<v Speaker 1>essentially through a long tunnel.</v>

24
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.740
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of kind of scary music in the background and the ends up</v>

25
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.570
<v Speaker 1>contemplating himself in a dark pool and then his father appears in the sky.</v>

26
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.840
<v Speaker 1>And so that's one example of the re construction of the mythology of</v>

27
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.030
<v Speaker 1>encountering your father in the abyss.</v>

28
00:01:14.031 --> 00:01:16.130
<v Speaker 1>You look into the abyss and you see your father.</v>

29
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.050
<v Speaker 1>And then in the Pinocchio Story,</v>

30
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:19.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

31
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.940
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio of course,</v>

32
00:01:19.941 --> 00:01:22.400
<v Speaker 1>when he's trying to become a genuine human being,</v>

33
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.470
<v Speaker 1>instead of a marionette pulled by other people's strings or a neurotic or a,</v>

34
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.510
<v Speaker 1>or a liar or a jackass,</v>

35
00:01:29.511 --> 00:01:31.530
<v Speaker 1>cause those are his alternate destinies.</v>

36
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

37
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.470
<v Speaker 1>he goes down to the darkest place he could find the bottom of the ocean and</v>

38
00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:37.640
<v Speaker 1>finds the biggest monster.</v>

39
00:01:37.641 --> 00:01:40.940
<v Speaker 1>He can look at it and inside he finds his father and in rescues him.</v>

40
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.373
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

41
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.490
<v Speaker 1>and the question is,</v>

42
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.910
<v Speaker 1>why do you find your father when you look into the abyss?</v>

43
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.320
<v Speaker 1>And I really did do think I figured this out and it's quite exciting to me.</v>

44
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.510
<v Speaker 1>It's such a brilliant image.</v>

45
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.180
<v Speaker 1>So we know as clinicians and,</v>

46
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.220
<v Speaker 1>and also I would say a sensible people,</v>

47
00:01:58.221 --> 00:02:02.030
<v Speaker 1>but there's good clinical documentation of this that if you find out,</v>

48
00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.410
<v Speaker 1>imagine someone's pursuing a goal and some of the things they have to accomplish</v>

49
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.640
<v Speaker 1>or confront on the way to that goal,</v>

50
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.100
<v Speaker 1>frightened them and they start to avoid.</v>

51
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.420
<v Speaker 1>And then they get more afraid.</v>

52
00:02:14.421 --> 00:02:19.130
<v Speaker 1>And of course their ability to pursue their goal or to accomplish their goal</v>

53
00:02:19.131 --> 00:02:20.750
<v Speaker 1>deteriorates because they're avoiding,</v>

54
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.710
<v Speaker 1>if you're a psychotherapist or even a friend or or,</v>

55
00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:26.180
<v Speaker 1>or a supportive loved one,</v>

56
00:02:26.181 --> 00:02:31.070
<v Speaker 1>let's say you're going to encourage the person to face the challenges that are</v>

57
00:02:31.071 --> 00:02:33.530
<v Speaker 1>making them afraid to face them voluntarily.</v>

58
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.470
<v Speaker 1>And what happens as a consequence of that is that the person usually is able to</v>

59
00:02:39.471 --> 00:02:44.010
<v Speaker 1>overcome those fears and develop the necessary skills and,</v>

60
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.410
<v Speaker 1>and to prevail.</v>

61
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.580
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly because not so much because they get less afraid,</v>

62
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.850
<v Speaker 1>but because they get more skilled and more courageous.</v>

63
00:02:52.851 --> 00:02:54.770
<v Speaker 1>And so imagine that if you</v>

64
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.160
<v Speaker 1>bite off a little more than you can chew,</v>

65
00:02:58.161 --> 00:03:00.400
<v Speaker 1>you get stronger as a consequence.</v>

66
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.260
<v Speaker 1>And you do that in the gym.</v>

67
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.861
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

68
00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:03.910
<v Speaker 1>when you go lift weights,</v>

69
00:03:03.911 --> 00:03:06.010
<v Speaker 1>you lift weights that are a little heavier all the time.</v>

70
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.360
<v Speaker 1>And as a consequence,</v>

71
00:03:07.361 --> 00:03:10.970
<v Speaker 1>you develop yourself physically and you turn into who you could be.</v>

72
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.670
<v Speaker 1>You turned into more than you are.</v>

73
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.631
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

74
00:03:13.631 --> 00:03:17.320
<v Speaker 1>So if you face fears a little bit at a time,</v>

75
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:18.370
<v Speaker 1>fears and challenges,</v>

76
00:03:18.371 --> 00:03:19.720
<v Speaker 1>and you do that voluntarily,</v>

77
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.330
<v Speaker 1>then you become more than who you are.</v>

78
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.261
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

79
00:03:23.261 --> 00:03:27.250
<v Speaker 1>Now let's recast that in architectural language and make it into a kind of</v>

80
00:03:27.251 --> 00:03:28.084
<v Speaker 1>ultimate.</v>

81
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.750
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

82
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.200
<v Speaker 1>so if you want to become everything that you could be,</v>

83
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.570
<v Speaker 1>then you look into the abyss itself,</v>

84
00:03:34.571 --> 00:03:37.510
<v Speaker 1>which is the darkest place that you can possibly contemplate.</v>

85
00:03:37.511 --> 00:03:40.890
<v Speaker 1>And that would be the terror of Maura mortality and insanity and,</v>

86
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.450
<v Speaker 1>and of suffering and end of malevolence,</v>

87
00:03:43.451 --> 00:03:44.051
<v Speaker 1>all of those.</v>

88
00:03:44.051 --> 00:03:45.430
<v Speaker 1>It would be like looking into hell,</v>

89
00:03:45.431 --> 00:03:46.810
<v Speaker 1>I suppose to some degree.</v>

90
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.950
<v Speaker 1>And then by voluntarily doing that,</v>

91
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.980
<v Speaker 1>then you call upon the strongest part of yourself to respond and the strongest</v>

92
00:03:55.991 --> 00:04:00.610
<v Speaker 1>part of yourself as symbolized as the sleeping farther nested inside the beast.</v>

93
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.060
<v Speaker 1>And so the fundamental truth when you look into an abyss is that you don't see</v>

94
00:04:06.251 --> 00:04:06.791
<v Speaker 1>the abyss.</v>

95
00:04:06.791 --> 00:04:07.750
<v Speaker 1>If you look long enough,</v>

96
00:04:07.751 --> 00:04:10.270
<v Speaker 1>it's like the unanswered to niches conundrum.</v>

97
00:04:10.271 --> 00:04:14.110
<v Speaker 1>If you look long enough into a bis and ambitious than the abyss looks into you,</v>

98
00:04:14.111 --> 00:04:14.501
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

99
00:04:14.501 --> 00:04:14.681
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

100
00:04:14.681 --> 00:04:19.240
<v Speaker 1>if you look long enough into an abyss passed when the abyss looks into you,</v>

101
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.450
<v Speaker 1>you see who you could become in the form of your,</v>

102
00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.480
<v Speaker 1>of the great ancestral figures nested inside the catastrophe of life,</v>

103
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.070
<v Speaker 1>and then you can join them,</v>

104
00:04:30.071 --> 00:04:30.791
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

105
00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:33.280
<v Speaker 1>You can incorporate that and become stronger.</v>

106
00:04:33.281 --> 00:04:36.970
<v Speaker 1>And you do that partly by taking on the challenge voluntarily.</v>

107
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.500
<v Speaker 1>And that informs you because you learn when you take on challenges voluntarily.</v>

108
00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.790
<v Speaker 1>But you also do that as a consequence of psychophysiological transformation</v>

109
00:04:45.791 --> 00:04:48.790
<v Speaker 1>because when you place yourself in challenging situations,</v>

110
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.440
<v Speaker 1>let's say the abyss is the archetype of the ultimately challenging situation,</v>

111
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.270
<v Speaker 1>then you turn on new genes in your nervous system and in your body that code for</v>

112
00:04:58.271 --> 00:05:01.810
<v Speaker 1>new proteins and you build new structures inside of you.</v>

113
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.430
<v Speaker 1>And none of that's going to happen without the demand that's placed on you by</v>

114
00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:09.340
<v Speaker 1>willing to confront the full terror of life.</v>

115
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.720
<v Speaker 1>And so then I would say the full terror of life is something like the reality of</v>

116
00:05:13.721 --> 00:05:14.680
<v Speaker 1>suffering and death.</v>

117
00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:19.681
<v Speaker 1>And the ever present and the the ever looming presence of malevolence in your</v>

118
00:05:19.961 --> 00:05:21.700
<v Speaker 1>own heart and in the heart of other people.</v>

119
00:05:21.701 --> 00:05:26.701
<v Speaker 1>So it's evil and suffering and to confront that is really well you risk</v>

120
00:05:26.831 --> 00:05:28.360
<v Speaker 1>blindness by confronting that.</v>

121
00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:29.890
<v Speaker 1>That's also a very old story.</v>

122
00:05:29.891 --> 00:05:31.510
<v Speaker 1>You risk damaging your vision,</v>

123
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.850
<v Speaker 1>but if you do it forthrightly,</v>

124
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.730
<v Speaker 1>then you discover who you could be as a consequence and who you could be is the</v>

125
00:05:39.731 --> 00:05:42.040
<v Speaker 1>solution to malevolence and suffering.</v>

126
00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.010
<v Speaker 1>And so that just blew me away when I figured that out.</v>

127
00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:46.660
<v Speaker 1>It was partly a consequence of,</v>

128
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.893
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

129
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.520
<v Speaker 1>having lengthy discussions with Sam Harris and thinking this through more and</v>

130
00:05:51.521 --> 00:05:53.140
<v Speaker 1>more been pushed to think it through.</v>

131
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.900
<v Speaker 1>But I think that's an absolutely staggering.</v>

132
00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.153
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

133
00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.053
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>

134
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.580
<v Speaker 1>Articulating that,</v>

135
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.730
<v Speaker 1>articulating that image fully for me.</v>

136
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I've articulated it fully,</v>

137
00:06:07.071 --> 00:06:10.370
<v Speaker 1>but articulating it more fully really had a profound effect on me.</v>

138
00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:11.204
<v Speaker 1>I think that's,</v>

139
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:16.270
<v Speaker 1>it's such a brilliant conceptualization that inside the darkest place is the</v>

140
00:06:17.781 --> 00:06:22.781
<v Speaker 1>heroic ancestor that whose identity you could incorporate.</v>

141
00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:24.380
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

142
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:25.101
<v Speaker 1>It's perfect.</v>

143
00:06:25.101 --> 00:06:26.120
<v Speaker 1>And I really believe it's true.</v>

144
00:06:26.121 --> 00:06:30.980
<v Speaker 1>And what it does is it says that human being is actually stronger than the</v>

145
00:06:30.981 --> 00:06:34.100
<v Speaker 1>greatest challenge that can be set before him or her.</v>

146
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:35.780
<v Speaker 1>And that's really something.</v>

147
00:06:35.781 --> 00:06:36.860
<v Speaker 1>I also believe it's true.</v>

148
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.053
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter how,</v>

149
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.420
<v Speaker 1>the other thing that's so interesting about that is that it,</v>

150
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.180
<v Speaker 1>it transforms pessimism into optimism.</v>

151
00:06:44.181 --> 00:06:44.511
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

152
00:06:44.511 --> 00:06:46.010
<v Speaker 1>well the world is a very dark place.</v>

153
00:06:46.011 --> 00:06:48.020
<v Speaker 1>It's full of suffering and it's full of malevolence.</v>

154
00:06:48.021 --> 00:06:52.280
<v Speaker 1>And it might even be so full of suffering and malevolence that a reasonable</v>

155
00:06:52.281 --> 00:06:56.980
<v Speaker 1>person could question the justification of its being a,</v>

156
00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:58.780
<v Speaker 1>as Ivan Grandma's off does in,</v>

157
00:06:58.781 --> 00:07:01.280
<v Speaker 1>in the brothers Karamazov which I would highly recommend.</v>

158
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:01.701
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

159
00:07:01.701 --> 00:07:03.140
<v Speaker 1>that's an absolutely great book,</v>

160
00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:03.983
<v Speaker 1>Dostoevsky.</v>

161
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:05.210
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

162
00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:06.170
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

163
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.820
<v Speaker 1>the truth of the matter seems to be that if you face the pessimism full frontal,</v>

164
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:11.690
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

165
00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:12.923
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

166
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.380
<v Speaker 1>then you find something in you that can,</v>

167
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.560
<v Speaker 1>that's strong enough to take it on.</v>

168
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:20.990
<v Speaker 1>And that's really says something about,</v>

169
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:22.281
<v Speaker 1>what would you say,</v>

170
00:07:22.281 --> 00:07:24.590
<v Speaker 1>the relationship between human beings and divinity,</v>

171
00:07:24.591 --> 00:07:25.424
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

172
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:30.550
<v Speaker 1>because it takes something transcendent of transcendent power to be able to rise</v>

173
00:07:33.231 --> 00:07:36.200
<v Speaker 1>above the genuine suffering and malevolence of life.</v>

174
00:07:36.201 --> 00:07:39.920
<v Speaker 1>And I do think that we have that within us if we don't shy away from the</v>

175
00:07:39.921 --> 00:07:40.754
<v Speaker 1>challenge.</v>

176
00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:42.620
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

177
00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:46.880
<v Speaker 1>there's in the story of King Arthur and the holy grail,</v>

178
00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.030
<v Speaker 1>so the holy grail is one of two things.</v>

179
00:07:50.031 --> 00:07:55.031
<v Speaker 1>It's a cup that either held the wine that Christ drank at the last supper or</v>

180
00:07:55.161 --> 00:07:59.450
<v Speaker 1>that was used to catch his blood when he was speared on the cross.</v>

181
00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:00.403
<v Speaker 1>Either one.</v>

182
00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:01.490
<v Speaker 1>But it's the,</v>

183
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:03.110
<v Speaker 1>it's the reservoir,</v>

184
00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:03.741
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

185
00:08:03.741 --> 00:08:06.590
<v Speaker 1>of the fluid that eternally nourishes.</v>

186
00:08:06.591 --> 00:08:07.700
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

187
00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.210
<v Speaker 1>And when you go to look for the holy Grail,</v>

188
00:08:11.211 --> 00:08:14.180
<v Speaker 1>you don't know where to look because you don't know where the holy grail is.</v>

189
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.660
<v Speaker 1>And so King Arthur and his knights who all sit at a round table,</v>

190
00:08:17.661 --> 00:08:21.620
<v Speaker 1>because there is essentially equals each go off to find the holy grail.</v>

191
00:08:21.621 --> 00:08:26.621
<v Speaker 1>And each of them enters the forest to begin the quest at the place that looks</v>

192
00:08:26.841 --> 00:08:28.070
<v Speaker 1>darkest to him.</v>

193
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:31.790
<v Speaker 1>And that's another example of the same idea.</v>

194
00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:33.740
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you and another,</v>

195
00:08:33.741 --> 00:08:36.680
<v Speaker 1>it's another example of a dictum from Carl Young,</v>

196
00:08:36.681 --> 00:08:38.840
<v Speaker 1>which he extracted from the oil chemical literature,</v>

197
00:08:38.841 --> 00:08:42.140
<v Speaker 1>which was in stir Colinas infinite tour,</v>

198
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:47.350
<v Speaker 1>which means roughly speaking in filth that will be found or more to the point</v>

199
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:51.320
<v Speaker 1>what you most need will be found where you least want to look,</v>

200
00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.210
<v Speaker 1>but you have to look purposefully.</v>

201
00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:54.740
<v Speaker 1>If it chases you,</v>

202
00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:55.860
<v Speaker 1>you're prey.</v>

203
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:57.420
<v Speaker 1>If you confront it,</v>

204
00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.670
<v Speaker 1>then you're the thing that can transcend it.</v>

205
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:04.830
<v Speaker 1>And that's a unbelievably optimistic message because it suggests that if you're</v>

206
00:09:04.831 --> 00:09:08.880
<v Speaker 1>willing to take on the burden of being with it's suffering and malevolence,</v>

207
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:13.620
<v Speaker 1>that you can awaken that with that which is within you,</v>

208
00:09:13.621 --> 00:09:18.621
<v Speaker 1>that will allow you to prevail and God only knows how deep an idea that is.</v>

209
00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:24.630
<v Speaker 1>It might be the deepest of ideas because who knows what the limit of a human</v>

210
00:09:24.901 --> 00:09:29.580
<v Speaker 1>being is so well that's some of the wisdom so to speak,</v>

211
00:09:29.581 --> 00:09:32.690
<v Speaker 1>that have acquired in the last few months and there's quite a bit more too and,</v>

212
00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:36.580
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to write all this down and hopefully publish a bunch of it.</v>

213
00:09:36.581 --> 00:09:40.260
<v Speaker 1>And my next book I figured out a bunch about hierarchies to and how they</v>

214
00:09:40.261 --> 00:09:40.741
<v Speaker 1>function.</v>

215
00:09:40.741 --> 00:09:41.910
<v Speaker 1>And a whole,</v>

216
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.930
<v Speaker 1>I've developed a whole new way of conceptualizing.</v>

217
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:51.350
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I was arguing with about Sam arguing with about with Sam</v>

218
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:54.510
<v Speaker 1>Harris was the relationship between facts and values.</v>

219
00:09:54.511 --> 00:09:57.660
<v Speaker 1>Because Sam and he has his reasons.</v>

220
00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:01.410
<v Speaker 1>We'd like to propose that we can derive values directly from facts.</v>

221
00:10:01.411 --> 00:10:05.430
<v Speaker 1>And he wants to do that because he wants to nail the world of values to</v>

222
00:10:05.431 --> 00:10:07.730
<v Speaker 1>something solid so it doesn't float in air and,</v>

223
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:08.300
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

224
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:08.790
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

225
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:09.510
<v Speaker 1>and get,</v>

226
00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:10.343
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

227
00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:11.483
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

228
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:12.900
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>

229
00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:18.120
<v Speaker 1>Hijacked by the fundamentalists or dissolve into nihilism.</v>

230
00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:21.180
<v Speaker 1>And both of those are terrible ends for a hierarchy of value.</v>

231
00:10:21.181 --> 00:10:26.181
<v Speaker 1>So he wants to nail it to something more objective and,</v>

232
00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.760
<v Speaker 1>and less relativistic and less,</v>

233
00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:36.300
<v Speaker 1>less grounded in revealed truth that removes it from the domain of</v>

234
00:10:36.301 --> 00:10:36.991
<v Speaker 1>fundamentalism.</v>

235
00:10:36.991 --> 00:10:40.380
<v Speaker 1>And so I can understand his point and why he wants to do that.</v>

236
00:10:40.381 --> 00:10:44.310
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is is that it isn't easy to derive values from facts because</v>

237
00:10:44.311 --> 00:10:49.311
<v Speaker 1>there's an infinite number of facts and by necessity a very finite number of</v>

238
00:10:49.441 --> 00:10:50.070
<v Speaker 1>values.</v>

239
00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:50.880
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

240
00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.380
<v Speaker 1>most of the time when you're doing something,</v>

241
00:10:52.381 --> 00:10:57.240
<v Speaker 1>you're reducing the whole world to one value and that value is encapsulated in</v>

242
00:10:57.241 --> 00:11:00.570
<v Speaker 1>whatever goal you happen to be pursuing at the moment or whatever you're paying</v>

243
00:11:00.571 --> 00:11:01.231
<v Speaker 1>attention to,</v>

244
00:11:01.231 --> 00:11:03.450
<v Speaker 1>which is also a form of goal directed pursuit.</v>

245
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:05.400
<v Speaker 1>And so I've also figured out that,</v>

246
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.110
<v Speaker 1>and I kind of knew this,</v>

247
00:11:07.111 --> 00:11:08.790
<v Speaker 1>but I could articulate it better now,</v>

248
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:13.050
<v Speaker 1>that you look at the world of facts through a hierarchy of values and that</v>

249
00:11:13.051 --> 00:11:17.830
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy of values is instantiated in your nervous system and Simile Tanium as</v>

250
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.740
<v Speaker 1>a social construct because you pay attention to things of value that you and</v>

251
00:11:22.741 --> 00:11:27.720
<v Speaker 1>everyone else have established as valuable through a process of social</v>

252
00:11:27.721 --> 00:11:28.560
<v Speaker 1>negotiation.</v>

253
00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.830
<v Speaker 1>And you need to pay attention to what you think that's valuable,</v>

254
00:11:31.831 --> 00:11:35.700
<v Speaker 1>that everyone else thinks is valuable because otherwise you wouldn't have any</v>

255
00:11:35.701 --> 00:11:39.630
<v Speaker 1>basis for shared attention and you wouldn't have any basis for trade with other</v>

256
00:11:39.631 --> 00:11:40.410
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

257
00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:41.490
<v Speaker 1>So that's another thing.</v>

258
00:11:41.491 --> 00:11:43.590
<v Speaker 1>So that's really been helpful because,</v>

259
00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:48.890
<v Speaker 1>so now I figured out that you reduce the infinite world of facts to the finite</v>

260
00:11:49.381 --> 00:11:54.381
<v Speaker 1>world of values by viewing the world of facts through what's essentially a</v>

261
00:11:54.401 --> 00:11:56.590
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy of value.</v>

262
00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:57.963
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

263
00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:02.650
<v Speaker 1>and that that exists both out in the social world and neurologically at the same</v>

264
00:12:02.651 --> 00:12:03.190
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

265
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:06.280
<v Speaker 1>And so that's been unbelievably useful to figure out too.</v>

266
00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:10.480
<v Speaker 1>And a part of a mystery that I'd been trying to untangle for about three</v>

267
00:12:10.481 --> 00:12:11.314
<v Speaker 1>decades.</v>

268
00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:11.980
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
