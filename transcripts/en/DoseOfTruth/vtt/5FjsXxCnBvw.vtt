00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.180
<v Speaker 1>I constantly cannot verbalize my</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts,</v>

2
00:00:09.181 --> 00:00:12.600
<v Speaker 1>written and focal regardless of topic</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my level of knowledge.</v>

3
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.010
<v Speaker 1>Tips for verbalizing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts to get them into writing and</v>

4
00:00:17.011 --> 00:00:18.180
<v Speaker 1>therefore speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.380
<v Speaker 1>what I would say Lauren is do this like</v>
<v Speaker 1>read something,</v>

6
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.790
<v Speaker 1>put a decide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to summarize it in writing and talk</v>

7
00:00:28.831 --> 00:00:31.650
<v Speaker 1>while you're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then write down what you say and</v>

8
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.890
<v Speaker 1>don't edit while you're doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See what are the problems that people</v>

9
00:00:34.891 --> 00:00:38.700
<v Speaker 1>have when they're trying to write is</v>
<v Speaker 1>they try to write a good sentence.</v>

10
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.750
<v Speaker 1>They not only tried to write a sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they try to write a good sentence</v>

11
00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:45.510
<v Speaker 1>and you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to write a sentence that's hard</v>

12
00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:50.511
<v Speaker 1>enough and then you have to edit it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So allow yourself to write badly.</v>

13
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm dead serious about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like write a bad,</v>

14
00:00:53.791 --> 00:00:57.630
<v Speaker 1>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad first draft and then edit it if you</v>

15
00:00:57.631 --> 00:00:59.130
<v Speaker 1>get rid of 70% of it.</v>

16
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.350
<v Speaker 1>So what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what should happen.</v>

17
00:01:01.351 --> 00:01:03.540
<v Speaker 1>So like if you want to write a thousand</v>
<v Speaker 1>word essay,</v>

18
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.700
<v Speaker 1>you should start by writing a really bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>2000 word essay and then you should get</v>

19
00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:11.460
<v Speaker 1>rid of the worst 50% you can do that</v>
<v Speaker 1>iteratively.</v>

20
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.050
<v Speaker 1>I have a document online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

21
00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.020
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go to my website,</v>

22
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.550
<v Speaker 1>under courses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's psychology for 30 is the course.</v>

23
00:01:20.551 --> 00:01:24.240
<v Speaker 1>I should make this more public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But under cycle psychology for 30,</v>

24
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.560
<v Speaker 1>there's a template for writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you went and looked at that</v>

25
00:01:28.561 --> 00:01:31.320
<v Speaker 1>template,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it tells you it answers your question.</v>

26
00:01:31.321 --> 00:01:34.590
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I produced this little guide book for,</v>

27
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.310
<v Speaker 1>for writing that will help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you write enough,</v>

28
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.660
<v Speaker 1>you'll learn to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing I would say too is that</v>

29
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.490
<v Speaker 1>it might be anxiety that's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think about joining a club</v>

30
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.420
<v Speaker 1>like toastmasters or maybe if you're a</v>
<v Speaker 1>university student to public speaking,</v>

31
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something where you'd get in front of</v>

32
00:01:54.061 --> 00:01:56.100
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when you're in front of people,</v>

33
00:01:56.101 --> 00:01:58.620
<v Speaker 1>don't talk to the group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked to the individuals within the</v>

34
00:01:58.621 --> 00:02:02.970
<v Speaker 1>group and let yourself be bad at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll get better as you practice.</v>
