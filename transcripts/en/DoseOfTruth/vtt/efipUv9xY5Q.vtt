1
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.831
<v Speaker 1>I did you see,</v>

2
00:00:11.831 --> 00:00:12.760
<v Speaker 1>you see how this works?</v>

3
00:00:12.761 --> 00:00:16.330
<v Speaker 1>It's just while here are ways you can be creative and here are a strata of</v>

4
00:00:16.331 --> 00:00:17.920
<v Speaker 1>accomplishment within those ways.</v>

5
00:00:17.921 --> 00:00:20.200
<v Speaker 1>And so then the question is what does it look like?</v>

6
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.063
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

7
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.870
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

8
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.520
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

9
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:25.931
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

10
00:00:25.931 --> 00:00:26.550
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough.</v>

11
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.701
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

12
00:00:26.701 --> 00:00:26.980
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

13
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.250
<v Speaker 1>and this probably needs to be updated to reflect that.</v>

14
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.353
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

15
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.081
<v Speaker 1>so there's,</v>

16
00:00:32.081 --> 00:00:33.760
<v Speaker 1>there's the distribution of scores.</v>

17
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:34.840
<v Speaker 1>Now that's dismal.</v>

18
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.430
<v Speaker 1>That's abysmal thing to look at.</v>

19
00:00:36.431 --> 00:00:37.600
<v Speaker 1>You have to understand that,</v>

20
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.510
<v Speaker 1>why look at this zero,</v>

21
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.860
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

22
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.880
<v Speaker 1>The median person has not done anything creative ever in their life with</v>

23
00:00:45.881 --> 00:00:47.330
<v Speaker 1>anything on any dementia,</v>

24
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:48.251
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

25
00:00:48.251 --> 00:00:49.690
<v Speaker 1>It's really important to know that.</v>

26
00:00:49.691 --> 00:00:51.520
<v Speaker 1>And then you have these horrible people out here,</v>

27
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

28
00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:54.820
<v Speaker 1>They do everything.</v>

29
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.990
<v Speaker 1>They do everything.</v>

30
00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.160
<v Speaker 1>Price's law.</v>

31
00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.180
<v Speaker 1>Here's price's law.</v>

32
00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.220
<v Speaker 1>This is something to hammer into your heart.</v>

33
00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.060
<v Speaker 1>The square root of the number of people in the domain do 50% of the work.</v>

34
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.561
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

35
00:01:05.561 --> 00:01:05.921
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>

36
00:01:05.921 --> 00:01:06.760
<v Speaker 1>let's go through that.</v>

37
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:07.810
<v Speaker 1>You have 10 employees.</v>

38
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:08.441
<v Speaker 1>Three of them do.</v>

39
00:01:08.441 --> 00:01:10.270
<v Speaker 1>Half the work makes sense.</v>

40
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.133
<v Speaker 1>That's reasonable.</v>

41
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.280
<v Speaker 1>You have a hundred employees,</v>

42
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.560
<v Speaker 1>10 of them do half the work.</v>

43
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.993
<v Speaker 1>That's problem.</v>

44
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.670
<v Speaker 1>So the other 90% are doing the other half.</v>

45
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.110
<v Speaker 1>Who cares about them?</v>

46
00:01:20.111 --> 00:01:21.520
<v Speaker 1>You have 10,000 employees,</v>

47
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.590
<v Speaker 1>a hundred of them do half the work,</v>

48
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.581
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

49
00:01:24.581 --> 00:01:25.091
<v Speaker 1>So here's a,</v>

50
00:01:25.091 --> 00:01:26.590
<v Speaker 1>here's a nasty little law.</v>

51
00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.180
<v Speaker 1>As your company grows in,</v>

52
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.580
<v Speaker 1>competence grows exponentially and competence grows linearly.</v>

53
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.990
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>

54
00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.380
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

55
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.960
<v Speaker 1>Because with 10 it's three who are doing half the work,</v>

56
00:01:37.961 --> 00:01:40.210
<v Speaker 1>but at 10,000 it's a hundred that are doing half the work.</v>

57
00:01:40.211 --> 00:01:45.211
<v Speaker 1>So 9,900 of your employees are doing as much as the best 100 you might not even</v>

58
00:01:45.941 --> 00:01:47.140
<v Speaker 1>know who the best 100 are,</v>

59
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.230
<v Speaker 1>but probably they know and maybe their peers know too.</v>

60
00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.500
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that's really interesting when big companies start to</v>

61
00:01:53.501 --> 00:01:53.981
<v Speaker 1>shake,</v>

62
00:01:53.981 --> 00:01:55.720
<v Speaker 1>which means maybe they've had a bad quarter,</v>

63
00:01:55.721 --> 00:01:58.660
<v Speaker 1>two bad quarters and the stock price starts to tip down.</v>

64
00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.673
<v Speaker 1>And the people,</v>

65
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.770
<v Speaker 1>the hot people who have options are not very happy about that.</v>

66
00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.700
<v Speaker 1>And maybe they start to announce layoffs.</v>

67
00:02:04.701 --> 00:02:07.930
<v Speaker 1>All the a hundred people who have opportunities leave and they're the ones who</v>

68
00:02:07.931 --> 00:02:08.950
<v Speaker 1>were doing half the work.</v>

69
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.430
<v Speaker 1>So boy that puts your company in a pretty rough situation because now you've got</v>

70
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.200
<v Speaker 1>the 9,900 people left over who were only doing half the work and the next time</v>

71
00:02:17.201 --> 00:02:20.560
<v Speaker 1>you announced layoffs the next most productive hundred leave.</v>

72
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.850
<v Speaker 1>And so then you're left with nobody who's productive at a massive overhead</v>

73
00:02:24.851 --> 00:02:27.100
<v Speaker 1>payroll price's law.</v>

74
00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.911
<v Speaker 1>You can look that up.</v>

75
00:02:27.911 --> 00:02:31.870
<v Speaker 1>Does sola price to solar price is a guy who was looking at scientific</v>

76
00:02:31.871 --> 00:02:35.260
<v Speaker 1>productivity and one of the things he found was when he was looking at Phd</v>

77
00:02:35.261 --> 00:02:40.261
<v Speaker 1>students is that the median number of publications for a phd graduate when he</v>

78
00:02:40.571 --> 00:02:41.111
<v Speaker 1>did his work,</v>

79
00:02:41.111 --> 00:02:44.530
<v Speaker 1>which was in the early sixties was one okay,</v>

80
00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.880
<v Speaker 1>half as many had two half as many as that had three half as many as that had</v>

81
00:02:48.881 --> 00:02:49.440
<v Speaker 1>four.</v>

82
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.660
<v Speaker 1>It's a real step down and one of the corollaries of that is that there's a</v>

83
00:02:52.661 --> 00:02:56.020
<v Speaker 1>certain number of people who are hyper productive and that's these people out</v>

84
00:02:56.021 --> 00:02:56.854
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

85
00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.050
<v Speaker 1>And if you were graphing the,</v>

86
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:00.850
<v Speaker 1>let's say you graft,</v>

87
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.760
<v Speaker 1>how many people in a population of 300 head,</v>

88
00:03:03.761 --> 00:03:05.470
<v Speaker 1>$10,000 in a savings account,</v>

89
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.000
<v Speaker 1>it would look very much like this.</v>

90
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.180
<v Speaker 1>Some of them would have some of them.</v>

91
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.133
<v Speaker 1>Some of them would.</v>

92
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.360
<v Speaker 1>Most people would have no savings whatsoever.</v>

93
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.030
<v Speaker 1>The median person would have no savings whatsoever.</v>

94
00:03:16.031 --> 00:03:18.220
<v Speaker 1>And then you go up here where the 1% is,</v>

95
00:03:18.221 --> 00:03:19.054
<v Speaker 1>they have all the money.</v>

96
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.140
<v Speaker 1>But the thing you want to understand about that 1% issue that you always hear</v>

97
00:03:23.141 --> 00:03:27.640
<v Speaker 1>about is that it applies in every single realm where there's difference in</v>

98
00:03:27.641 --> 00:03:28.480
<v Speaker 1>creative production.</v>

99
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.673
<v Speaker 1>Every realm,</v>

100
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:30.783
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>

101
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:31.960
<v Speaker 1>Number of records produced,</v>

102
00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:32.950
<v Speaker 1>number of records sold,</v>

103
00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:34.270
<v Speaker 1>number of compositions written.</v>

104
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.870
<v Speaker 1>So here,</v>

105
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:35.220
<v Speaker 1>here's a,</v>

106
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.100
<v Speaker 1>here's an example.</v>

107
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.400
<v Speaker 1>Five composers produce the music that occupies 50% of the classical rep</v>

108
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:43.293
<v Speaker 1>repertoire,</v>

109
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

110
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:44.080
<v Speaker 1>Bach,</v>

111
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.710
<v Speaker 1>Beethoven,</v>

112
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:45.400
<v Speaker 1>Brahms,</v>

113
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.270
<v Speaker 1>Tchaikovsky,</v>

114
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.890
<v Speaker 1>Mozart.</v>

115
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:48.341
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

116
00:03:48.341 --> 00:03:48.941
<v Speaker 1>Those five.</v>

117
00:03:48.941 --> 00:03:49.211
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

118
00:03:49.211 --> 00:03:50.320
<v Speaker 1>so here's something cool.</v>

119
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.550
<v Speaker 1>So you take all the music.</v>

120
00:03:51.551 --> 00:03:54.490
<v Speaker 1>Those people wrote 5% of the music.</v>

121
00:03:54.491 --> 00:03:59.491
<v Speaker 1>All those people wrote occupies 50% of the music that of their writing that's</v>

122
00:03:59.981 --> 00:04:00.814
<v Speaker 1>played.</v>

123
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.241
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

124
00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:04.670
<v Speaker 1>not only do almost all the composers never get Alyson,</v>

125
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.790
<v Speaker 1>but even among the composers who do get,</v>

126
00:04:06.791 --> 00:04:07.151
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

127
00:04:07.151 --> 00:04:09.190
<v Speaker 1>almost none of their music ever gets played.</v>

128
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:10.630
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

129
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:11.463
<v Speaker 1>so then that's,</v>

130
00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.900
<v Speaker 1>that's another example of this price's law of scaling.</v>

131
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.030
<v Speaker 1>So when it applies to all sorts of things,</v>

132
00:04:16.031 --> 00:04:19.090
<v Speaker 1>like number of hockey goals scored is also distributed this way.</v>

133
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.500
<v Speaker 1>Number of basketball,</v>

134
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:24.790
<v Speaker 1>basketball basketball's successfully put through the hoop,</v>

135
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.290
<v Speaker 1>follows the same distribution.</v>

136
00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.860
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

137
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.110
<v Speaker 1>size of cities follows the same distribution.</v>

138
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:30.310
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird,</v>

139
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.190
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird law and you,</v>

140
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.760
<v Speaker 1>you can think about it in part,</v>

141
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:35.800
<v Speaker 1>why does this happen?</v>

142
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.380
<v Speaker 1>While imagine what happens when you play monopoly.</v>

143
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.330
<v Speaker 1>What happens?</v>

144
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.250
<v Speaker 1>Everybody has the same amount of money to begin with,</v>

145
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:43.533
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

146
00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:44.890
<v Speaker 1>So then you start playing,</v>

147
00:04:44.891 --> 00:04:46.300
<v Speaker 1>it's basically a random game.</v>

148
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.510
<v Speaker 1>While some people start to win a bit and some people start to lose a bit.</v>

149
00:04:49.511 --> 00:04:50.420
<v Speaker 1>And then if you win,</v>

150
00:04:50.421 --> 00:04:53.440
<v Speaker 1>the high probability that you'll keep winning starts to increase.</v>

151
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:54.520
<v Speaker 1>And if you lose,</v>

152
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.920
<v Speaker 1>your vulnerability increases as you lose.</v>

153
00:04:56.921 --> 00:04:59.380
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe you've got say six people playing monopoly,</v>

154
00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.861
<v Speaker 1>soon.</v>

155
00:04:59.861 --> 00:05:01.060
<v Speaker 1>One person has zero.</v>

156
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.650
<v Speaker 1>What happens when they have zero?</v>

157
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.013
<v Speaker 1>They're out of the game.</v>

158
00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.630
<v Speaker 1>So zero's a weird number because when you hit zero,</v>

159
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:08.620
<v Speaker 1>you're out of the game.</v>

160
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.120
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

161
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.230
<v Speaker 1>so then if you keep playing,</v>

162
00:05:11.231 --> 00:05:12.910
<v Speaker 1>people start to stack up at zero,</v>

163
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

164
00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.040
<v Speaker 1>What happens at the end of the game?</v>

165
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.810
<v Speaker 1>One person has all the property and all the money and everyone else has none,</v>

166
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

167
00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.250
<v Speaker 1>That that's what happens if you play an iterated trading game to its final</v>

168
00:05:24.251 --> 00:05:25.084
<v Speaker 1>conclusion.</v>

169
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.720
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of the law in a sense that's underlying this kind of</v>

170
00:05:28.721 --> 00:05:29.554
<v Speaker 1>distribution.</v>

171
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.221
<v Speaker 1>So it's a,</v>

172
00:05:30.221 --> 00:05:31.060
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>

173
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.470
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

174
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:31.771
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

175
00:05:31.771 --> 00:05:35.050
<v Speaker 1>it's not a consequence necessarily of structural inequality.</v>

176
00:05:35.051 --> 00:05:37.480
<v Speaker 1>It's built into the system at a deeper level than that.</v>

177
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:38.021
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

178
00:05:38.021 --> 00:05:38.351
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

179
00:05:38.351 --> 00:05:42.430
<v Speaker 1>people talk about all the time about how unfair it is that 1% of the population</v>

180
00:05:42.431 --> 00:05:46.780
<v Speaker 1>has the vast amount of the money and 1% of the 1% has most of that money.</v>

181
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.260
<v Speaker 1>And 1% of the 1% of the 1% has most of that money.</v>

182
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.513
<v Speaker 1>But it is a,</v>

183
00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:52.623
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

184
00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.660
<v Speaker 1>it's an inevitable conclusion of iterated trading games.</v>

185
00:05:55.661 --> 00:05:57.010
<v Speaker 1>And we don't know how to fight.</v>

186
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.030
<v Speaker 1>We don't know how to take from the people who have and move it to the bottom</v>

187
00:06:02.031 --> 00:06:04.190
<v Speaker 1>without an instantly moving back up to the top.</v>

188
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:05.480
<v Speaker 1>Different people maybe,</v>

189
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.710
<v Speaker 1>but still back up to the top because even the 1% churns a lot.</v>

190
00:06:09.711 --> 00:06:12.710
<v Speaker 1>Like I think you have a 10% chance,</v>

191
00:06:12.711 --> 00:06:13.640
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>

192
00:06:13.641 --> 00:06:18.440
<v Speaker 1>you have a 10% chance of being in the top 1% for at least one year of your life</v>

193
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.480
<v Speaker 1>and a 40% chance of being in the top 10% for at least one year in your life.</v>

194
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.000
<v Speaker 1>That's in Canada and the U S it's less so in Europe,</v>

195
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.880
<v Speaker 1>so there's a fair bit of churning at the top end.</v>

196
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:31.340
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same people all the time who have the money,</v>

197
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.030
<v Speaker 1>but it is a tiny fraction of the people all the time who have all the money.</v>

198
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:39.813
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

199
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:47.240
<v Speaker 1>Do the people inside redistribute to recreate the scene?</v>

200
00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:48.500
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

201
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.333
<v Speaker 1>Unusually.</v>

202
00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:50.961
<v Speaker 1>I mean they do,</v>

203
00:06:50.961 --> 00:06:52.070
<v Speaker 1>but it's attenuated.</v>

204
00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:52.940
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

205
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:57.940
<v Speaker 1>Because the people mean if you reshuffled the entire company and put everywhere</v>

206
00:06:58.551 --> 00:06:59.151
<v Speaker 1>somewhere else,</v>

207
00:06:59.151 --> 00:07:02.090
<v Speaker 1>there's some probability that some of those people would rise to the top that</v>

208
00:07:02.091 --> 00:07:03.200
<v Speaker 1>weren't at the top before.</v>

209
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.320
<v Speaker 1>But in that company that that isn't generally what happens.</v>

210
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:08.900
<v Speaker 1>People get stuck in their niche and they don't move.</v>

211
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:10.940
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

212
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:11.960
<v Speaker 1>this is cool.</v>

213
00:07:11.961 --> 00:07:12.800
<v Speaker 1>You wonder sometimes,</v>

214
00:07:12.801 --> 00:07:12.981
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

215
00:07:12.981 --> 00:07:14.540
<v Speaker 1>how can companies die so quickly?</v>

216
00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:15.081
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

217
00:07:15.081 --> 00:07:15.381
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>

218
00:07:15.381 --> 00:07:18.500
<v Speaker 1>they go into a death spiral that's almost impossible for them to get out of.</v>

219
00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:19.570
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

220
00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:20.061
<v Speaker 1>and it happened.</v>

221
00:07:20.061 --> 00:07:21.530
<v Speaker 1>It can happen extraordinarily quickly.</v>

222
00:07:21.531 --> 00:07:22.364
<v Speaker 1>This is why,</v>

223
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:22.611
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

224
00:07:22.611 --> 00:07:25.370
<v Speaker 1>the typical fortune 500 company only lasts 30 years.</v>

225
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:26.293
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

226
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.900
<v Speaker 1>It's not that easy for these Bam Mos to continue existence across time.</v>

227
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:30.920
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

228
00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.080
<v Speaker 1>and it's because it's really easy for something to die.</v>

229
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.210
<v Speaker 1>It's very unlikely that it will be built.</v>

230
00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:39.020
<v Speaker 1>It's very unlikely that it will be successful and one successful.</v>

231
00:07:39.021 --> 00:07:42.290
<v Speaker 1>It's very unlikely that it will continue to duplicate it success because the</v>

232
00:07:42.291 --> 00:07:45.830
<v Speaker 1>underlying landscape shifts on it and it doesn't know where to go.</v>

233
00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:46.561
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

234
00:07:46.561 --> 00:07:51.140
<v Speaker 1>that's also partly because it's not that easy to integrate creative people into</v>

235
00:07:51.141 --> 00:07:51.890
<v Speaker 1>your company.</v>

236
00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:52.460
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

237
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.950
<v Speaker 1>You certainly don't want them at the bottom because they're supposed to be</v>

238
00:07:54.951 --> 00:07:56.630
<v Speaker 1>people who are doing what they're told to do.</v>

239
00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:00.320
<v Speaker 1>So you filter out a lot of them at the bottom and then you need them at the top.</v>

240
00:08:00.321 --> 00:08:01.670
<v Speaker 1>But they've already been filtered out.</v>

241
00:08:01.671 --> 00:08:05.600
<v Speaker 1>And also creative people are troublesome to work with because they're always,</v>

242
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:07.820
<v Speaker 1>how do you evaluate a creative person?</v>

243
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:08.930
<v Speaker 1>You all,</v>

244
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:13.370
<v Speaker 1>you almost can't by definition because they keep coming up with new things and</v>

245
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:15.950
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a good evaluative strategy for a new thing.</v>

246
00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:19.070
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't be new if you had a good evaluative strategy for it,</v>

247
00:08:19.071 --> 00:08:19.221
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

248
00:08:19.221 --> 00:08:22.250
<v Speaker 1>It would have to be the member of a class that you've already encountered</v>

249
00:08:22.251 --> 00:08:23.084
<v Speaker 1>substantially.</v>

250
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:24.310
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

251
00:08:24.311 --> 00:08:28.130
<v Speaker 1>so the take home lesson from this is zero,</v>

252
00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

253
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:30.860
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

254
00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:31.640
<v Speaker 1>And then that's like,</v>

255
00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.790
<v Speaker 1>that's like a graph of of money and monetary distribution as well.</v>

256
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:35.450
<v Speaker 1>And the thing,</v>

257
00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:38.750
<v Speaker 1>the problem with being at zero is very difficult to get out of zero.</v>

258
00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:41.120
<v Speaker 1>And this is also why people get stuck in poverty.</v>

259
00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:41.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

260
00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:43.160
<v Speaker 1>you can't get a bank account if you're,</v>

261
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:44.390
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have any money,</v>

262
00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:45.253
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

263
00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:49.280
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of things that start to move against you when you're at zero</v>

264
00:08:49.281 --> 00:08:50.450
<v Speaker 1>that you can't shake.</v>

265
00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.220
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to get out of the.</v>
