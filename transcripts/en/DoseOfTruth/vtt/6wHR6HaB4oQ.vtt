1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.280
<v Speaker 1>And the persona is the mask that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>wear.</v>

2
00:00:02.281 --> 00:00:06.120
<v Speaker 1>And that's what persona means is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mask that you wear to convince yourself</v>

3
00:00:06.121 --> 00:00:08.010
<v Speaker 1>and the world that you're not a terrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>monster.</v>

4
00:00:08.011 --> 00:00:09.600
<v Speaker 1>So that when you look at yourself in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mirror,</v>

5
00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:11.940
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to run away screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6
00:00:11.941 --> 00:00:14.100
<v Speaker 1>when you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's a bit of an overstatement,</v>

7
00:00:14.101 --> 00:00:19.101
<v Speaker 1>but you'll was very interested in</v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomena such as,</v>

8
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.630
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say psychological,</v>

9
00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:25.710
<v Speaker 1>the psychological phenomena that would</v>
<v Speaker 1>characterize the actions of someone who</v>

10
00:00:25.711 --> 00:00:28.620
<v Speaker 1>might be an Auschwitz camp guard for</v>
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

11
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.900
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.970
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty monstrous form of</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

13
00:00:32.971 --> 00:00:36.990
<v Speaker 1>And the thing about Auschwitz camp</v>
<v Speaker 1>guards is that there's no reason to</v>

14
00:00:36.991 --> 00:00:41.160
<v Speaker 1>assume really that they were much</v>
<v Speaker 1>different than normal people.</v>

15
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.750
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there would have been exceptions</v>

16
00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:44.160
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

17
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.050
<v Speaker 1>and what that means is that perhaps you</v>
<v Speaker 1>two could be an Auschwitz camp guard and</v>

18
00:00:49.051 --> 00:00:51.150
<v Speaker 1>perhaps he would even derive some</v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoyment out of it.</v>

19
00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:54.390
<v Speaker 1>And you might think not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you shouldn't think not so quickly.</v>

20
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.920
<v Speaker 1>And what that also implies is that if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could see what that meant when you</v>

21
00:00:58.921 --> 00:01:00.540
<v Speaker 1>looked in the mirror and looked at</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

22
00:01:00.541 --> 00:01:04.500
<v Speaker 1>you might run away screaming because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have a revelation of just exactly</v>

23
00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:08.190
<v Speaker 1>what the human being is capable of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very unpleasant revelation.</v>

24
00:01:08.191 --> 00:01:12.090
<v Speaker 1>And also one of the things that stops</v>
<v Speaker 1>people from being enlightened because</v>

25
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.560
<v Speaker 1>that revelation of the evil of the self</v>
<v Speaker 1>is part of the journey to enlightenment</v>

26
00:01:16.561 --> 00:01:17.370
<v Speaker 1>and an early part.</v>
