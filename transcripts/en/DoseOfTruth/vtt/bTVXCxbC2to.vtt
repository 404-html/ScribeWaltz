1
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.840
<v Speaker 1>Would you have voted for Donald Trump?</v>

2
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.220
<v Speaker 2>That's a hard question.</v>

3
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.930
<v Speaker 2>You know when it's funny,</v>

4
00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:17.090
<v Speaker 2>because I've been Canada,</v>

5
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.440
<v Speaker 2>I actually went to,</v>

6
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.920
<v Speaker 2>I was invited out to a private club the night of the American election by a</v>

7
00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:26.450
<v Speaker 2>couple of Americans and there was a bunch of Americans at this club and they did</v>

8
00:00:26.451 --> 00:00:29.930
<v Speaker 2>a straw vote and you know,</v>

9
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.030
<v Speaker 2>I thought that what I probably would have done when it came right down to it</v>

10
00:00:35.031 --> 00:00:37.200
<v Speaker 2>because I had to vote hey in the struggle.</v>

11
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.260
<v Speaker 2>So that was a pretty reasonable simulation.</v>

12
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.160
<v Speaker 2>I think what I would've done was walk into the voting booth with the intention</v>

13
00:00:43.161 --> 00:00:47.420
<v Speaker 2>of voting for Clinton and then at the last minute gone to hell with it.</v>

14
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing it and voted for trump.</v>

15
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.530
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what I would've done.</v>

16
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.810
<v Speaker 2>And I thought about it a lot afterwards.</v>

17
00:00:53.811 --> 00:00:54.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

18
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.090
<v Speaker 2>for the entire election virtually,</v>

19
00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:57.140
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

20
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.140
<v Speaker 2>well Clinton has the experience necessary to at least keep the status quo in</v>

21
00:01:04.311 --> 00:01:04.790
<v Speaker 2>motion,</v>

22
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:05.623
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

23
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.520
<v Speaker 2>So in some sense she was a conservative choice because she'd been in politics</v>

24
00:01:10.521 --> 00:01:11.354
<v Speaker 2>for so long.</v>

25
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.860
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

26
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.860
<v Speaker 2>But then as the campaign continued and she continued to beat the identity</v>

27
00:01:19.011 --> 00:01:21.080
<v Speaker 2>politics drum louder and louder,</v>

28
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.420
<v Speaker 2>I became more and more concerned about her political direction or ideological</v>

29
00:01:26.421 --> 00:01:27.254
<v Speaker 2>direction.</v>

30
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.680
<v Speaker 2>And then I thought when I was thinking about what happened to the United States,</v>

31
00:01:30.681 --> 00:01:30.981
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

32
00:01:30.981 --> 00:01:31.131
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

33
00:01:31.131 --> 00:01:33.170
<v Speaker 2>here's what the Americans decided.</v>

34
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.900
<v Speaker 2>They decided that they liked the unscripted,</v>

35
00:01:35.901 --> 00:01:36.561
<v Speaker 2>impulsive,</v>

36
00:01:36.561 --> 00:01:39.380
<v Speaker 2>live better than the scripted,</v>

37
00:01:39.381 --> 00:01:40.214
<v Speaker 2>conniving,</v>

38
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:41.383
<v Speaker 2>unscripted,</v>

39
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.110
<v Speaker 2>impulsive lies of trump better than the conniving scripted lines of Clinton.</v>

40
00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.800
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like the two choices were so brilliant.</v>

41
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.450
<v Speaker 2>So I think I would have impulsively voted for trump at the last moment.</v>

42
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:54.411
<v Speaker 2>I think so,</v>

43
00:01:54.411 --> 00:01:54.651
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

44
00:01:54.651 --> 00:01:54.891
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

45
00:01:54.891 --> 00:01:55.820
<v Speaker 2>I can't be sure,</v>

46
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.130
<v Speaker 2>but it wouldn't have been with the sense of delight.</v>

47
00:01:58.131 --> 00:01:59.060
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you that.</v>

48
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.340
<v Speaker 1>So it would have been based on like your sort of logically,</v>

49
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.490
<v Speaker 1>rationally you might have argued Hillary Clinton is the conservative pick</v>

50
00:02:09.501 --> 00:02:11.810
<v Speaker 1>because she's not going to up in the system.</v>

51
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.040
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to be great,</v>

52
00:02:13.041 --> 00:02:15.020
<v Speaker 1>but we know what we're going to get with her.</v>

53
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.090
<v Speaker 1>But deep down viscerally,</v>

54
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.860
<v Speaker 1>maybe you feel like,</v>

55
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.113
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

56
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.340
<v Speaker 1>what would that visceral sort of sense of Ben for trauma?</v>

57
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.200
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

58
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.330
<v Speaker 2>it's a repugnance I,</v>

59
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.340
<v Speaker 2>I really do find identity politics repugnant and I don't use that term lightly.</v>

60
00:02:31.131 --> 00:02:36.020
<v Speaker 2>I think that we're making a very big mistake to retry belies our,</v>

61
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.310
<v Speaker 2>our social,</v>

62
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.100
<v Speaker 2>our social conceptual structure.</v>

63
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.851
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

64
00:02:40.851 --> 00:02:40.980
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

65
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.980
<v Speaker 2>the big advantage to being in the west was that we live in a society where the</v>

66
00:02:46.011 --> 00:02:50.330
<v Speaker 2>individual is sovereign and some miraculous achievement that we've managed that</v>

67
00:02:50.331 --> 00:02:51.830
<v Speaker 2>both conceptually and practically.</v>

68
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.300
<v Speaker 2>And then to see the,</v>

69
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.880
<v Speaker 2>the left is pushing this I think.</v>

70
00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.550
<v Speaker 2>I think the left is responsible for this in large part the radical to read,</v>

71
00:03:00.551 --> 00:03:02.140
<v Speaker 2>divide us among ethnic,</v>

72
00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 2>sexual or racial lines and then other lines without.</v>

73
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.470
<v Speaker 2>And I think if a catastrophic error and I just,</v>

74
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.320
<v Speaker 2>the Democrats just did far too much of that and I wasn't happy at all that they</v>

75
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:15.700
<v Speaker 2>abandoned the working class.</v>

76
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.751
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

77
00:03:16.751 --> 00:03:19.180
<v Speaker 2>like I have a fair bit of sympathy,</v>

78
00:03:19.181 --> 00:03:21.310
<v Speaker 2>let's say for the working class.</v>

79
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.160
<v Speaker 2>Coming from a working class background,</v>

80
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.610
<v Speaker 2>having had a dozen or more working class jobs.</v>

81
00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.993
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

82
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.030
<v Speaker 2>and also some real appreciation for working class people.</v>

83
00:03:32.031 --> 00:03:33.340
<v Speaker 2>Like I liked working with my hands.</v>

84
00:03:33.341 --> 00:03:33.970
<v Speaker 2>I've worked,</v>

85
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.620
<v Speaker 2>I've done a lot of renovation projects,</v>

86
00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:39.100
<v Speaker 2>I've worked with a lot of contractors and plumbers and carpenters and those</v>

87
00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:44.020
<v Speaker 2>sorts of people and I felt that they had been abandoned by the Democrats and</v>

88
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.800
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

89
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.400
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>

90
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.710
<v Speaker 2>that was a real betrayal,</v>

91
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.070
<v Speaker 2>a fundamental betrayal.</v>

92
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:49.300
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

93
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.550
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

94
00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

95
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.060
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm not alone in those thoughts.</v>

96
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:53.350
<v Speaker 2>That's for sure.</v>

97
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.531
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

98
00:03:53.531 --> 00:03:54.910
<v Speaker 2>the same thing is happening in Canada.</v>

99
00:03:54.911 --> 00:03:56.020
<v Speaker 2>The classic left wing,</v>

100
00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.450
<v Speaker 2>the left wing in Canada has moved away from its proper concentration on the</v>

101
00:04:01.451 --> 00:04:02.380
<v Speaker 2>concerns of the,</v>

102
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.270
<v Speaker 2>of the working class poor.</v>

103
00:04:04.271 --> 00:04:08.080
<v Speaker 2>Let's say I started planning this intellectual identity politics game,</v>

104
00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:11.590
<v Speaker 2>which I think is why do I really find a detestable?</v>

105
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:11.971
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

106
00:04:11.971 --> 00:04:12.804
<v Speaker 1>me too.</v>

107
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:13.450
<v Speaker 1>Me Too.</v>

108
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:13.960
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

109
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.210
<v Speaker 1>I think there's absolutely no doubt that the left started this and that they're</v>

110
00:04:18.211 --> 00:04:19.260
<v Speaker 1>to blame for it,</v>

111
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.660
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like Donald Trump,</v>

112
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.420
<v Speaker 1>so what conservatism and American conservatism until recently said,</v>

113
00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.873
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

114
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.780
<v Speaker 1>identity politics is bad,</v>

115
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.150
<v Speaker 1>therefore we're not going to play the game.</v>

116
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:34.740
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to do it.</v>

117
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.550
<v Speaker 1>And I believe that Donald trump was a vote for,</v>

118
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:39.031
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

119
00:04:39.031 --> 00:04:40.890
<v Speaker 1>we have to fight fire with fire.</v>

120
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.410
<v Speaker 1>If they're going to play it,</v>

121
00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:44.820
<v Speaker 1>that's the big danger.</v>

122
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.821
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

123
00:04:45.821 --> 00:04:47.060
<v Speaker 2>and that's one of the things that I've,</v>

124
00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

125
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.220
<v Speaker 2>I've saved most of my online vitriol,</v>

126
00:04:50.221 --> 00:04:53.040
<v Speaker 2>let's say for the radical left because,</v>

127
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.570
<v Speaker 2>and I think the primary reason for that is because of my academic background,</v>

128
00:04:57.571 --> 00:05:00.180
<v Speaker 2>it's the route the radical left has,</v>

129
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.160
<v Speaker 2>has undue influence in academia and then from academia into the broader world,</v>

130
00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

131
00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.950
<v Speaker 2>so it makes sense for me,</v>

132
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:13.010
<v Speaker 2>especially given the compelled speech law in Canada to be primarily concerned</v>

133
00:05:13.531 --> 00:05:15.840
<v Speaker 2>with the overreach of the radical left,</v>

134
00:05:15.841 --> 00:05:18.840
<v Speaker 2>but it's not like I'm thrilled with the identity Iranian,</v>

135
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:19.703
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

136
00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:20.910
<v Speaker 2>Because they're doing the same thing.</v>

137
00:05:20.911 --> 00:05:21.360
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

138
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.260
<v Speaker 2>they're mode or their,</v>

139
00:05:22.261 --> 00:05:23.460
<v Speaker 2>their strategy is different,</v>

140
00:05:23.461 --> 00:05:23.641
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

141
00:05:23.641 --> 00:05:28.641
<v Speaker 2>Because the radical left strategy is identify the majority group and defeat them</v>

142
00:05:28.711 --> 00:05:29.790
<v Speaker 2>with something like guilt.</v>

143
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.460
<v Speaker 2>But the radical right strategy is well except the majority a virtue,</v>

144
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.290
<v Speaker 2>let's say and when,</v>

145
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.273
<v Speaker 2>when the fight,</v>

146
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:39.720
<v Speaker 2>but none of them,</v>

147
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.430
<v Speaker 2>neither of those approaches are gonna work.</v>

148
00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.811
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

149
00:05:42.811 --> 00:05:43.560
<v Speaker 2>like even the,</v>

150
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.360
<v Speaker 2>even the white supremacist approach,</v>

151
00:05:45.361 --> 00:05:45.840
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>

152
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

153
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.070
<v Speaker 2>it's fatally flawed in a variety of ways apart from its pure,</v>

154
00:05:50.071 --> 00:05:51.070
<v Speaker 2>reprehensible realty.</v>

155
00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.391
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

156
00:05:51.391 --> 00:05:51.900
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

157
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:52.531
<v Speaker 2>who's white?</v>

158
00:05:52.531 --> 00:05:53.364
<v Speaker 2>Exactly</v>

159
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:55.620
<v Speaker 2>like we're,</v>

160
00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 2>how do you draw these distinctions is the problem.</v>

161
00:05:58.161 --> 00:05:58.521
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

162
00:05:58.521 --> 00:06:00.410
<v Speaker 2>the intersection left has run into.</v>

163
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.180
<v Speaker 2>They run into the impossibility of making group identifications with any degree</v>

164
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:05.811
<v Speaker 2>of accuracy,</v>

165
00:06:05.811 --> 00:06:08.750
<v Speaker 2>but the same problem technically speaking,</v>

166
00:06:08.751 --> 00:06:10.520
<v Speaker 2>be devil's attempts on the right.</v>

167
00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.390
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

168
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:12.223
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

169
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.270
<v Speaker 2>what are the people who inhabit northern India?</v>

170
00:06:14.271 --> 00:06:15.104
<v Speaker 2>Are they white?</v>

171
00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:16.920
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

172
00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:17.661
<v Speaker 2>Where exactly?</v>

173
00:06:17.661 --> 00:06:18.920
<v Speaker 2>You're drawing the boundaries here.</v>

174
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:19.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

175
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

176
00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.090
<v Speaker 1>it really matters all polling way of looking at things.</v>

177
00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:30.060
<v Speaker 1>I have the sense that that the problem is that what the left wants to do today</v>

178
00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.580
<v Speaker 1>is not to achieve parody.</v>

179
00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.560
<v Speaker 1>They don't want women or minorities to achieve parody and be equal.</v>

180
00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:39.630
<v Speaker 1>They want them to be superior,</v>

181
00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:40.531
<v Speaker 1>so in other words,</v>

182
00:06:40.531 --> 00:06:42.390
<v Speaker 1>they believe in a zero sum game.</v>

183
00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.190
<v Speaker 1>They don't believe we can grow the pie and everybody be more prosperous.</v>

184
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.430
<v Speaker 1>They believed that there was zero,</v>

185
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.560
<v Speaker 1>zero ba winners,</v>

186
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:53.220
<v Speaker 1>the winners and losers,</v>

187
00:06:53.221 --> 00:06:55.020
<v Speaker 1>and therefore they have to tear down.</v>

188
00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.000
<v Speaker 1>Let's say men for example,</v>

189
00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.550
<v Speaker 1>in the me too moment in order to elevate women.</v>

190
00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:01.001
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

191
00:07:01.001 --> 00:07:01.310
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

192
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:02.930
<v Speaker 2>the zero sum problems,</v>

193
00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.230
<v Speaker 2>a real one that bedeviled the left forever.</v>

194
00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:06.100
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

195
00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:09.790
<v Speaker 2>and there there are constant claim is well we live in a resource,</v>

196
00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:11.183
<v Speaker 2>a resource</v>

197
00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.950
<v Speaker 2>scarce environment and yeah,</v>

198
00:07:14.951 --> 00:07:18.940
<v Speaker 2>there has to be winners and losers and I don't think there's any evidence for</v>

199
00:07:18.941 --> 00:07:19.774
<v Speaker 2>that at all.</v>

200
00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:20.763
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

201
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:21.690
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

202
00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:22.430
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

203
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.720
<v Speaker 2>even if they're not out to attain like an inversion,</v>

204
00:07:25.721 --> 00:07:26.554
<v Speaker 2>so that the,</v>

205
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:27.200
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

206
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.600
<v Speaker 2>the last become first,</v>

207
00:07:28.601 --> 00:07:33.601
<v Speaker 2>let's say there are certainly not paying any attention to the fact that</v>

208
00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:38.050
<v Speaker 2>equality of outcome is impossible.</v>

209
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:39.730
<v Speaker 2>Impossible goal.</v>

210
00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:41.560
<v Speaker 2>There's a measurement problems.</v>

211
00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.460
<v Speaker 2>So the measurement problem is well across what outcomes.</v>

212
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:48.610
<v Speaker 2>Exactly and I mean exactly because these are very important issues.</v>

213
00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.280
<v Speaker 2>You want people to be equal across all possible outcomes.</v>

214
00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:52.870
<v Speaker 2>Like where do you draw the borders?</v>

215
00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.210
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a big problem like and,</v>

216
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:58.660
<v Speaker 2>and then the next problem is who decides when they're equal,</v>

217
00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:03.210
<v Speaker 2>how do you set up a system that isn't the market system to decide when equality</v>

218
00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:04.173
<v Speaker 2>has been attained?</v>

219
00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.850
<v Speaker 2>So that's second insoluble problem.</v>

220
00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:10.840
<v Speaker 2>And then third insoluble problem is well across what groups?</v>

221
00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:14.980
<v Speaker 2>Because I don't know how many ethnic categories are used,</v>

222
00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:16.350
<v Speaker 2>say in the US labor boards,</v>

223
00:08:16.351 --> 00:08:17.950
<v Speaker 2>statistics and by the US government,</v>

224
00:08:17.951 --> 00:08:18.581
<v Speaker 2>but it's something.</v>

225
00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:19.414
<v Speaker 2>It's in the dozens,</v>

226
00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:23.890
<v Speaker 2>like so you're going to equate across all ethnicities.</v>

227
00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:26.800
<v Speaker 2>Are you going to equate across all social,</v>

228
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.480
<v Speaker 2>like socioeconomic categories?</v>

229
00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:32.050
<v Speaker 2>You're going to include the infinite number of genders in that,</v>

230
00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.060
<v Speaker 2>like their problem.</v>

231
00:08:34.061 --> 00:08:39.061
<v Speaker 2>Technically the problem that they're trying to solve can be solved technically</v>

232
00:08:39.131 --> 00:08:42.970
<v Speaker 2>impossible to solve it apart from the fact that it's also when it's put into</v>

233
00:08:42.971 --> 00:08:43.451
<v Speaker 2>practice,</v>

234
00:08:43.451 --> 00:08:46.030
<v Speaker 2>it's actually murderous equity doctrine,</v>

235
00:08:46.031 --> 00:08:47.410
<v Speaker 2>I think is a murderous doctrine,</v>

236
00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:48.970
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

237
00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:50.920
<v Speaker 2>but it's not so easy to put your finger on why.</v>
