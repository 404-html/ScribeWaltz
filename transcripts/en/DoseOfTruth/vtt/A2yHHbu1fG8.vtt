00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.440
<v Speaker 1>Looking at myself,</v>

2
00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:07.981
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>

3
00:00:07.981 --> 00:00:08.551
<v Speaker 1>John says,</v>

4
00:00:08.551 --> 00:00:11.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm deeply envious and resentful of others happiness.</v>

5
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.780
<v Speaker 1>How do I turn this around?</v>

6
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.490
<v Speaker 1>Where all John,</v>

7
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.150
<v Speaker 1>I would say you've started to turn it down around already because you have at</v>

8
00:00:20.701 --> 00:00:24.630
<v Speaker 1>least come to the conclusion that you're deeply envious and resentful of others</v>

9
00:00:24.631 --> 00:00:25.171
<v Speaker 1>happiness.</v>

10
00:00:25.171 --> 00:00:27.360
<v Speaker 1>So you did have the damn problem diagnosed.</v>

11
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.100
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things you might do is figure out what you would like instead.</v>

12
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.770
<v Speaker 1>Like how would you like to feel about the world,</v>

13
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.720
<v Speaker 1>because you're implying that being deeply envious and resentful isn't for the</v>

15
00:00:39.721 --> 00:00:40.554
<v Speaker 1>best.</v>

16
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.620
<v Speaker 1>So let's assume that you would rather be pleased about other people's successes</v>

17
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.110
<v Speaker 1>and not envious.</v>

18
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

19
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

20
00:00:49.981 --> 00:00:51.480
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you might think is,</v>

21
00:00:51.481 --> 00:00:55.290
<v Speaker 1>well maybe you have to do some writing or at least some thinking.</v>

22
00:00:55.291 --> 00:00:58.950
<v Speaker 1>It's like maybe the alternative would be happy,</v>

23
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.680
<v Speaker 1>be happy about other's success and happiness.</v>

24
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.570
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe you should start by thinking about why you might be happy about their</v>

25
00:01:06.571 --> 00:01:07.021
<v Speaker 1>happiness.</v>

26
00:01:07.021 --> 00:01:09.270
<v Speaker 1>It's not like happiness is a zero sum game,</v>

27
00:01:09.271 --> 00:01:09.481
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

28
00:01:09.481 --> 00:01:11.400
<v Speaker 1>it's not like it's not.</v>

29
00:01:11.401 --> 00:01:12.300
<v Speaker 1>And I believe me,</v>

30
00:01:12.301 --> 00:01:15.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking your question seriously and I think that what you're saying</v>

31
00:01:15.301 --> 00:01:19.770
<v Speaker 1>characterized as plenty of people and I think that you're being deeply honest,</v>

32
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:20.700
<v Speaker 1>noticing it,</v>

33
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.580
<v Speaker 1>happiness isn't a zero sum game.</v>

34
00:01:23.581 --> 00:01:24.414
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

35
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.970
<v Speaker 1>lots of people can be happy at the same time.</v>

36
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.040
<v Speaker 1>And do you really want to live in a world where other people are less happy in</v>

37
00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:36.030
<v Speaker 1>what possible manner would that be useful and good for you in the medium to</v>

38
00:01:36.031 --> 00:01:36.420
<v Speaker 1>longterm?</v>

39
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.620
<v Speaker 1>It might make you feel,</v>

40
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:39.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.500
<v Speaker 1>grudgingly a satisfied,</v>

42
00:01:43.501 --> 00:01:43.711
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:01:43.711 --> 00:01:45.450
<v Speaker 1>in a dark way temporarily,</v>

44
00:01:45.451 --> 00:01:47.610
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a very good long term strategy.</v>

45
00:01:47.611 --> 00:01:49.650
<v Speaker 1>So I would say you got to think it through,</v>

46
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

47
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.970
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

48
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.190
<v Speaker 1>how is it that you would like to view the world?</v>

49
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.960
<v Speaker 1>How do you think that would be best for you?</v>

50
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean as if you were taking care of yourself like you,</v>

51
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.650
<v Speaker 1>like you're someone who deserves to be taken care of.</v>

52
00:02:01.651 --> 00:02:03.780
<v Speaker 1>Think about how you'd like to have the world,</v>

53
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.880
<v Speaker 1>how he'd like to view the world.</v>

54
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.800
<v Speaker 1>And one of the ways you can do that too,</v>

55
00:02:07.801 --> 00:02:12.801
<v Speaker 1>is to think about some people that you admire and try to figure out how they</v>

56
00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:14.610
<v Speaker 1>look at the world or even ask them,</v>

57
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

58
00:02:15.511 --> 00:02:19.860
<v Speaker 1>because maybe then you can find out what it is about your thought patterns that</v>

59
00:02:19.861 --> 00:02:20.940
<v Speaker 1>are driving you down.</v>

60
00:02:20.941 --> 00:02:22.200
<v Speaker 1>This sort of dark road.</v>
