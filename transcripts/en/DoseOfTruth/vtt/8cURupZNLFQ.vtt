1
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.210
<v Speaker 1>I read some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dissertation about how male feminists</v>

2
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.390
<v Speaker 1>think about themselves and how they go</v>
<v Speaker 1>about having sex.</v>

3
00:00:13.391 --> 00:00:16.240
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every one of the men said that he's,</v>

4
00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.270
<v Speaker 1>he's way to approach sex was that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't take any initiative because he</v>

5
00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:22.760
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would foul,</v>

6
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

7
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.100
<v Speaker 1>the file,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

8
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.270
<v Speaker 1>the whole situation and the woman.</v>

9
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.931
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

10
00:00:27.931 --> 00:00:31.320
<v Speaker 2>it's like Andrea to work in a back in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 70s that horrible.</v>

11
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.990
<v Speaker 2>She's a horrible creature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Andrea at the work.</v>

12
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.453
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

13
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she said that it's men engaged in sexual</v>

14
00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:42.400
<v Speaker 2>behavior with an erect penis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That that was,</v>

15
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.720
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

16
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.570
<v Speaker 2>that was equivalent to violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

17
00:00:45.571 --> 00:00:47.680
<v Speaker 2>That was equivalent to rate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

18
00:00:47.681 --> 00:00:49.140
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

19
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what to say about</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

20
00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.050
<v Speaker 2>except that that's exactly what Andrea</v>
<v Speaker 2>to work and was like.</v>

21
00:00:56.051 --> 00:00:58.660
<v Speaker 2>And she was a real heroine to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>radical feminists,</v>

22
00:00:58.661 --> 00:01:01.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Harun where someone else around that</v>

23
00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:02.080
<v Speaker 2>period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

24
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.450
<v Speaker 2>Catherine Mckinnon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think her name was equally,</v>

25
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:06.803
<v Speaker 2>equally</v>

26
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.360
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a red book.</v>

27
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:12.363
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

28
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.780
<v Speaker 2>you would've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would've.</v>

29
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:14.291
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

30
00:01:14.291 --> 00:01:16.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from my perspective as a clinician,</v>

31
00:01:16.541 --> 00:01:20.740
<v Speaker 2>those people have clear every indication</v>
<v Speaker 2>of serious personality disorders.</v>

32
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.990
<v Speaker 2>And I actually think to some degree that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've made a haven for people who have</v>

33
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.780
<v Speaker 2>serious personality pathology in these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in these pseudo disciplines,</v>

34
00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:33.450
<v Speaker 2>in the universities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

35
00:01:33.451 --> 00:01:35.310
<v Speaker 2>you said something interesting you said</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

36
00:01:35.311 --> 00:01:36.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

37
00:01:36.481 --> 00:01:39.810
<v Speaker 2>when you went to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to when you took your sociology degree,</v>

38
00:01:39.811 --> 00:01:42.780
<v Speaker 2>that these were basically fringe views.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now their center views in the</v>

39
00:01:42.781 --> 00:01:45.210
<v Speaker 2>university,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also implying that they're</v>

40
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.220
<v Speaker 2>increasingly dominant views in society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the thing is that people</v>

41
00:01:50.221 --> 00:01:52.920
<v Speaker 2>think that these are somehow ivory tower</v>
<v Speaker 2>arguments.</v>

42
00:01:52.921 --> 00:01:57.000
<v Speaker 2>But what happens in the university's</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens in society five to 10 years</v>

43
00:01:57.001 --> 00:01:58.110
<v Speaker 2>later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

44
00:01:58.111 --> 00:02:00.000
<v Speaker 2>and that's exactly what's happening</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

45
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.403
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

46
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.340
<v Speaker 1>I think these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these leads us into the me to a debate</v>

47
00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.320
<v Speaker 1>because will you have people in Sweden</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now?</v>

48
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.850
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me too phenomenon is much larger in</v>

49
00:02:16.851 --> 00:02:18.950
<v Speaker 1>Sweden than in any other country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

50
00:02:18.951 --> 00:02:22.490
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's dominated the media for one month</v>

51
00:02:22.491 --> 00:02:23.151
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

52
00:02:23.151 --> 00:02:26.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every profession has,</v>

53
00:02:26.661 --> 00:02:27.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

54
00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has an mi to a sort of article with</v>

55
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.050
<v Speaker 1>thousands of women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

56
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.190
<v Speaker 1>signing on to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the teachers and the lawyers and the</v>

57
00:02:41.731 --> 00:02:45.780
<v Speaker 1>doctors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what one thing is interesting about</v>

58
00:02:45.781 --> 00:02:49.650
<v Speaker 1>this is how the men are handling it</v>
<v Speaker 1>because</v>

59
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.270
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of men writing that I as</v>

60
00:02:55.271 --> 00:02:56.420
<v Speaker 1>a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

61
00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.560
<v Speaker 1>have a responsibility for this</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

62
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.650
<v Speaker 1>I a man as a male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm responsible and I'm guilty and</v>

63
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.310
<v Speaker 1>actually it was one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are a lot of articles like</v>

64
00:03:07.311 --> 00:03:08.240
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then one of them,</v>

65
00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.450
<v Speaker 1>one of the men that was accused of doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>something inappropriate,</v>

66
00:03:11.451 --> 00:03:16.451
<v Speaker 1>it was the former leader for the left</v>
<v Speaker 1>Radical Party.</v>

67
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.040
<v Speaker 1>And if the thing he had done was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was not so reprehensible,</v>

68
00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.080
<v Speaker 1>he had approached a woman and then she</v>
<v Speaker 1>had said no and he had apologized,</v>

69
00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.920
<v Speaker 1>but then she didn't accept that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then now he's under investigation police</v>

70
00:03:30.921 --> 00:03:34.160
<v Speaker 1>investigation and we have this sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>witch hunt</v>

71
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.480
<v Speaker 2>is that almost all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all manifestations of male sexuality are</v>

72
00:03:42.021 --> 00:03:44.880
<v Speaker 2>going to be brought under legal control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he actually wrote</v>

73
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.660
<v Speaker 1>the article that said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

74
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.420
<v Speaker 1>I am responsible because I say I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible.</v>

75
00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm better than the majority of men's</v>
<v Speaker 1>reactions to this.</v>

76
00:03:53.991 --> 00:03:58.370
<v Speaker 1>So actually he turned the thing that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was being under investigation into</v>

77
00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.000
<v Speaker 1>because he showed that because he</v>
<v Speaker 1>admitted he showed that he was better.</v>

78
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.290
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

79
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.390
<v Speaker 2>so</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very our stay,</v>

80
00:04:06.391 --> 00:04:09.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean the whole idea was that you were</v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to come to terms with your</v>

81
00:04:09.721 --> 00:04:14.430
<v Speaker 2>class guilt and then confess and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then indicate that you could be</v>

82
00:04:14.431 --> 00:04:16.800
<v Speaker 2>brought back into the etiological fold</v>
<v Speaker 2>properly.</v>

83
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.870
<v Speaker 2>The thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot of muddy thinking.</v>

84
00:04:18.871 --> 00:04:21.240
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well man should take responsibility for</v>

85
00:04:21.241 --> 00:04:24.900
<v Speaker 2>their aggressive sexuality and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>should incorporate it.</v>

86
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.550
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you repress it,</v>

87
00:04:26.551 --> 00:04:29.370
<v Speaker 2>it just comes out in the most ugly way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>

88
00:04:29.371 --> 00:04:33.270
<v Speaker 2>part of the ideas that men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boys should be socialized like little</v>

89
00:04:33.271 --> 00:04:34.530
<v Speaker 2>girls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

90
00:04:34.531 --> 00:04:36.480
<v Speaker 2>But that's complete rubbish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

91
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.510
<v Speaker 2>even little girls perhaps shouldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 2>socialized like little curls,</v>

92
00:04:39.511 --> 00:04:42.840
<v Speaker 2>but whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's beside the point that that</v>

93
00:04:42.841 --> 00:04:47.640
<v Speaker 2>aggressive capacity that's associated</v>
<v Speaker 2>with sexuality as well as Freud pointed</v>

94
00:04:47.641 --> 00:04:50.430
<v Speaker 2>out so long ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>needs to be integrated within the</v>

95
00:04:50.431 --> 00:04:52.710
<v Speaker 2>personality so that it's under control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

96
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.410
<v Speaker 2>And then it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the hint of darkness and it's the</v>

97
00:04:55.411 --> 00:04:57.330
<v Speaker 2>capacity for malevolence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

98
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.900
<v Speaker 2>but it's brought under,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's brought under civilized</v>

99
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.660
<v Speaker 2>regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then you get to have your cake</v>

100
00:05:03.661 --> 00:05:04.471
<v Speaker 2>and eat it too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

101
00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:08.370
<v Speaker 2>You can be strong and potentially</v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous and mysterious and all of</v>

102
00:05:08.371 --> 00:05:10.740
<v Speaker 2>those things that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are definitely attractive.</v>

103
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.520
<v Speaker 2>That's an attractive features of men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only to women,</v>

104
00:05:14.521 --> 00:05:19.080
<v Speaker 2>but also to other men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have to take responsibility for</v>

105
00:05:19.081 --> 00:05:20.640
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that doesn't mean that you should</v>

106
00:05:20.641 --> 00:05:25.140
<v Speaker 2>identify yourself as the member of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>guilty group because of a class based</v>

107
00:05:25.141 --> 00:05:26.730
<v Speaker 2>accusation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

108
00:05:26.731 --> 00:05:30.270
<v Speaker 2>That's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not guilty as the member of a</v>

109
00:05:30.271 --> 00:05:32.040
<v Speaker 2>class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

110
00:05:32.041 --> 00:05:35.370
<v Speaker 2>that's part of the reason that I've been</v>
<v Speaker 2>pushing so hard against these</v>

111
00:05:35.371 --> 00:05:38.070
<v Speaker 2>postmodern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neo Marxist ideas because one of their</v>

112
00:05:38.071 --> 00:05:42.540
<v Speaker 2>essential predicates is that you can be</v>
<v Speaker 2>guilty as the member of a class.</v>

113
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.260
<v Speaker 2>And that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if there's a more dangerous</v>

114
00:05:46.261 --> 00:05:48.360
<v Speaker 2>idea then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that there might be,</v>

115
00:05:48.361 --> 00:05:52.490
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a very large number of extremely</v>

116
00:05:52.491 --> 00:05:54.140
<v Speaker 2>dangerous ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that one's,</v>

117
00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.100
<v Speaker 2>that one's up near the top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

118
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.600
<v Speaker 2>It's happening to great degree in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>United States to lesser so in Canada,</v>

119
00:06:02.601 --> 00:06:07.601
