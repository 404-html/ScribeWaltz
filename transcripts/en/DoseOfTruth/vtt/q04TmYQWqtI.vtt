1
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.800
<v Speaker 1>There's this idea in union psychology called the circumambulation and you only</v>

2
00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:15.801
<v Speaker 1>had this idea that you had a potential future self which would be in potential</v>

3
00:00:16.681 --> 00:00:21.600
<v Speaker 1>everything that you could be and that it manifests itself moment to moment in</v>

4
00:00:21.601 --> 00:00:26.601
<v Speaker 1>your present life by making you interested in things and the things that you're</v>

5
00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:30.240
<v Speaker 1>interested in are the things that would guide you along the path that would lead</v>

6
00:00:30.241 --> 00:00:31.590
<v Speaker 1>you to maximal development.</v>

7
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.160
<v Speaker 1>Now it sounds like a metaphysical idea or a or a mystical idea even,</v>

8
00:00:37.741 --> 00:00:38.574
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

9
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.450
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>

10
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:39.731
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

11
00:00:39.731 --> 00:00:40.291
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

12
00:00:40.291 --> 00:00:42.450
<v Speaker 1>It's a really profoundly biological idea.</v>

13
00:00:42.451 --> 00:00:43.530
<v Speaker 1>The idea is something like,</v>

14
00:00:43.531 --> 00:00:44.364
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

15
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.890
<v Speaker 1>you're set up so that you're automatically interested in those things that was</v>

16
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.570
<v Speaker 1>fully expand you as a well adapted creature while like there's nothing radical</v>

17
00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:54.840
<v Speaker 1>about that idea.</v>

18
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.710
<v Speaker 1>How else,</v>

19
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.760
<v Speaker 1>what else could possibly be the case unless there's something fundamentally</v>

20
00:00:59.761 --> 00:01:00.990
<v Speaker 1>flawed about you.</v>

21
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.450
<v Speaker 1>That is what the situation would be.</v>

22
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.930
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of interesting to think about how that would be manifest moment to</v>

23
00:01:06.931 --> 00:01:07.441
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>

24
00:01:07.441 --> 00:01:08.670
<v Speaker 1>but the idea is something like,</v>

25
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.430
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

26
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.210
<v Speaker 1>your interest is captured by those things that lead you down the path of</v>

27
00:01:13.211 --> 00:01:14.044
<v Speaker 1>development.</v>

28
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:15.730
<v Speaker 1>Well that better be the case.</v>

29
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.301
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

30
00:01:16.301 --> 00:01:17.134
<v Speaker 1>So that's fine.</v>

31
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.920
<v Speaker 1>And so there's some utility in pursuing those things that you're interested in.</v>

32
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.270
<v Speaker 1>That's the call to adventure,</v>

33
00:01:22.271 --> 00:01:23.104
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

34
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:24.520
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

35
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.650
<v Speaker 1>And the call to adventure takes you all sorts of places.</v>

36
00:01:26.651 --> 00:01:28.810
<v Speaker 1>Now the problem with the call to adventure is like,</v>

37
00:01:28.811 --> 00:01:29.860
<v Speaker 1>what the hell do you know?</v>

38
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.630
<v Speaker 1>You might be interested in things that are kind of warped and bent.</v>

39
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.500
<v Speaker 1>And often it's the case that when new parts of people manifest themselves and</v>

40
00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:40.800
<v Speaker 1>gripped their interest,</v>

41
00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:43.500
<v Speaker 1>say they do it very badly in shoddily.</v>

42
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.550
<v Speaker 1>And so you stumble around like an idiot when you try to do something new.</v>

43
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.400
<v Speaker 1>That's where the fool is the precursor to the savior from the,</v>

44
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.590
<v Speaker 1>from the symbolic perspectives.</v>

45
00:01:52.591 --> 00:01:55.050
<v Speaker 1>Cause you have to be a fool before you can be a master.</v>

46
00:01:55.051 --> 00:01:57.480
<v Speaker 1>And if you're not willing to be a fool and you can't be a master,</v>

47
00:01:57.481 --> 00:01:58.314
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

48
00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.970
<v Speaker 1>so you're going to,</v>

49
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:00.260
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

50
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.480
<v Speaker 1>it's an error,</v>

51
00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.490
<v Speaker 1>error ridden process.</v>

52
00:02:03.491 --> 00:02:06.430
<v Speaker 1>And that's also laid out in the old testament stories because the first thing</v>

53
00:02:06.431 --> 00:02:10.510
<v Speaker 1>that happens to all these patriarchal figures when God kicks them out of their</v>

54
00:02:10.511 --> 00:02:14.080
<v Speaker 1>father's house when they're like 84 is that they,</v>

55
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.150
<v Speaker 1>they run into all sorts of trouble.</v>

56
00:02:16.151 --> 00:02:19.300
<v Speaker 1>And some of it's social and some of it's natural and some of it's a consequence</v>

57
00:02:19.301 --> 00:02:20.830
<v Speaker 1>of their own moral inadequacy.</v>

58
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.040
<v Speaker 1>So they're fools and,</v>

59
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.500
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

60
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.310
<v Speaker 1>but the thing that's so interesting is that despite the fact that they're fools,</v>

61
00:02:27.311 --> 00:02:31.030
<v Speaker 1>they're still supposed to go on the adventure and that they're capable of</v>

62
00:02:31.031 --> 00:02:35.140
<v Speaker 1>learning enough as a consequence of moving forward on the adventure so that they</v>

63
00:02:35.141 --> 00:02:36.970
<v Speaker 1>straightened themselves out across time.</v>

64
00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.070
<v Speaker 1>And so it's something like this,</v>

65
00:02:39.071 --> 00:02:43.270
<v Speaker 1>and this circumambulation that young talked about was this continual,</v>

66
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.410
<v Speaker 1>we'll return to this,</v>

67
00:02:44.411 --> 00:02:48.220
<v Speaker 1>this continual circling in some sense of who you could be.</v>

68
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.121
<v Speaker 1>You might notice,</v>

69
00:02:49.121 --> 00:02:49.721
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

70
00:02:49.721 --> 00:02:51.250
<v Speaker 1>that there are themes in your life.</v>

71
00:02:51.251 --> 00:02:51.461
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

72
00:02:51.461 --> 00:02:53.950
<v Speaker 1>when you go back across your experiences,</v>

73
00:02:53.951 --> 00:02:54.221
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>

74
00:02:54.221 --> 00:02:57.400
<v Speaker 1>you kind of have your typical experience that sort of repeats itself.</v>

75
00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.910
<v Speaker 1>And there might be on it like a musical theme,</v>

76
00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:01.530
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

77
00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.680
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're,</v>

78
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:07.120
<v Speaker 1>you're circling yourself and getting closer to yourself as you move across time.</v>

79
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.510
<v Speaker 1>That's the circumambulation now you remember that for a second cause we'll go</v>

80
00:03:10.511 --> 00:03:11.344
<v Speaker 1>back to it.</v>

81
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.591
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

82
00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:14.230
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that something glimmers before you,</v>

83
00:03:14.231 --> 00:03:17.410
<v Speaker 1>it's an interest that's daunting and you decide,</v>

84
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.801
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

85
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:18.311
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

86
00:03:18.311 --> 00:03:19.091
<v Speaker 1>you're paralyzed.</v>

87
00:03:19.091 --> 00:03:19.421
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>

88
00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:21.010
<v Speaker 1>well how do I know if I should pursue that?</v>

89
00:03:21.011 --> 00:03:22.540
<v Speaker 1>It's probably a stupid idea.</v>

90
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.820
<v Speaker 1>And the proper response to that is,</v>

91
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:25.421
<v Speaker 1>you're right,</v>

92
00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:27.840
<v Speaker 1>it probably is a stupid idea because almost all,</v>

93
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.440
<v Speaker 1>all ideas are stupid.</v>

94
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.510
<v Speaker 1>And so the probability that as you move forward on your adventure that you're</v>

95
00:03:34.511 --> 00:03:37.210
<v Speaker 1>going to get it right the first time is zero.</v>

96
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:38.920
<v Speaker 1>It's just not going to happen.</v>

97
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.480
<v Speaker 1>And so then you might think,</v>

98
00:03:40.481 --> 00:03:43.870
<v Speaker 1>well maybe I'll just wait around until I get the right idea.</v>

99
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.370
<v Speaker 1>And which people do,</v>

100
00:03:45.371 --> 00:03:45.611
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

101
00:03:45.611 --> 00:03:47.020
<v Speaker 1>So they're like 40 year old,</v>

102
00:03:47.021 --> 00:03:47.890
<v Speaker 1>13 year olds,</v>

103
00:03:47.891 --> 00:03:49.330
<v Speaker 1>which is not a good idea.</v>

104
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.250
<v Speaker 1>So they wait around until it's waiting for Godot until they finally got it</v>

105
00:03:54.251 --> 00:03:54.551
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

106
00:03:54.551 --> 00:03:57.190
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is you're too stupid to know when you've got it right.</v>

107
00:03:57.191 --> 00:04:01.450
<v Speaker 1>So waiting around isn't going to help because even if it's the perfect</v>

108
00:04:01.451 --> 00:04:05.350
<v Speaker 1>opportunity manifested itself to you in your incomplete form,</v>

109
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.610
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you would recognize it as the perfect opportunity is zero.</v>

110
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.120
<v Speaker 1>You might even think it's the worst possible idea that you've ever heard of</v>

111
00:04:13.121 --> 00:04:13.930
<v Speaker 1>anywhere.</v>

112
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:14.920
<v Speaker 1>Highly likely,</v>

113
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.060
<v Speaker 1>highly likely.</v>

114
00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.170
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

115
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.930
<v Speaker 1>so you ha there's niche nichier called that.</v>

116
00:04:19.931 --> 00:04:20.080
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

117
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.351
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>

118
00:04:20.351 --> 00:04:21.520
<v Speaker 1>we'll to stupidity,</v>

119
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.840
<v Speaker 1>which I really liked.</v>

120
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.610
<v Speaker 1>So because he thought of stupidity as being it,</v>

121
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.771
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

122
00:04:26.771 --> 00:04:26.980
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

123
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:27.730
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

124
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.210
<v Speaker 1>you have to take it into account fundamentally and work with it.</v>

125
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:32.223
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

126
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.470
<v Speaker 1>and so you can take these tentative steps on your pathway to destiny and you can</v>

127
00:04:38.351 --> 00:04:40.060
<v Speaker 1>assume that you're going to do it badly.</v>

128
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.300
<v Speaker 1>And that's really useful because you don't have to beat yourself up.</v>

129
00:04:43.301 --> 00:04:44.830
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty easy to do it badly.</v>

130
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:46.121
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is,</v>

131
00:04:46.121 --> 00:04:48.730
<v Speaker 1>it's way better to do it badly than not to do it at all.</v>

132
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.790
<v Speaker 1>And that's the continual message that echoes through these historical stories in</v>

133
00:04:53.951 --> 00:04:54.491
<v Speaker 1>genesis.</v>

134
00:04:54.491 --> 00:04:56.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like these are flawed people.</v>

135
00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.860
<v Speaker 1>They should've got the hell out of their house way before they did.</v>

136
00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.973
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

137
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.010
<v Speaker 1>and they go out and they stumble around in tyranny and famine and self betrayal</v>

138
00:05:06.011 --> 00:05:06.610
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

139
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.710
<v Speaker 1>and violence.</v>

140
00:05:08.711 --> 00:05:09.190
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

141
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.100
<v Speaker 1>but it's a hell of a lot better than just rotting away at home.</v>
