1
00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:06.871
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:06.871 --> 00:00:10.930
<v Speaker 1>Well the problem is that what defines risk is often defined by her behavior.</v>

3
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.170
<v Speaker 1>The least risky thing is what everyone is doing.</v>

4
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:15.890
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're in a hurry,</v>

5
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:16.870
<v Speaker 1>that's certainly the case.</v>

6
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.170
<v Speaker 1>The least risky thing is to be in the middle of what everyone else in the herd</v>

7
00:00:20.171 --> 00:00:20.830
<v Speaker 1>is doing.</v>

8
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.580
<v Speaker 1>Creditors can't pick you off there and people act like that all the time.</v>

9
00:00:24.581 --> 00:00:25.320
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

10
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.190
<v Speaker 1>we'll stock market investment like Michael Risky when hardly anyone is doing it</v>

12
00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.000
<v Speaker 1>because the way that your brain is judging risk is by the number of people doing</v>

13
00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:34.510
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

14
00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.860
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as everyone's doing it,</v>

15
00:00:35.861 --> 00:00:39.160
<v Speaker 1>the risky thing is to be left behind because if you're left behind,</v>

16
00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.950
<v Speaker 1>predators will get you your the straggling sheet.</v>

17
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.780
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is the definition of what constitutes conservative</v>

18
00:00:46.781 --> 00:00:49.630
<v Speaker 1>changes as mass behavior changes.</v>

19
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.153
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

20
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.050
<v Speaker 1>so it isn't even obvious how to advise people as to what the conservative path</v>

21
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.533
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

22
00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:59.201
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

23
00:00:59.201 --> 00:00:59.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.700
<v Speaker 1>standard economic adviser would say diversify.</v>

25
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

26
00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.093
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

27
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.160
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you in the 2008 crash,</v>

28
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.550
<v Speaker 1>you could have diversified your money across multiple markets all over the</v>

29
00:01:12.551 --> 00:01:12.851
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

30
00:01:12.851 --> 00:01:14.020
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't help you damn bed,</v>

31
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:15.280
<v Speaker 1>everything came down.</v>

32
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.620
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

33
00:01:17.621 --> 00:01:18.550
<v Speaker 1>you can diversify,</v>

34
00:01:18.551 --> 00:01:21.430
<v Speaker 1>but that increases your transaction costs and you have to have quite a bit of</v>

35
00:01:21.431 --> 00:01:23.560
<v Speaker 1>money to do it and you have to have quite a bit of knowledge.</v>

36
00:01:23.561 --> 00:01:25.910
<v Speaker 1>And so it,</v>

37
00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.470
<v Speaker 1>the thing is it's not that easy to make a pile of grain lapsed and that's what</v>

38
00:01:32.081 --> 00:01:33.010
<v Speaker 1>we're always trying to do.</v>

39
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

40
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.470
<v Speaker 1>it did.</v>

41
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.220
<v Speaker 1>This disappears of its own accord.</v>

42
00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:37.031
<v Speaker 1>It deteriorates.</v>

43
00:01:37.031 --> 00:01:38.680
<v Speaker 1>Money does that with inflation.</v>

44
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.500
<v Speaker 1>People are always trying to nibble away at it,</v>

45
00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.970
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

46
00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.820
<v Speaker 1>And then now and then there's an earthquake and all the green disappears into</v>

47
00:01:45.821 --> 00:01:46.630
<v Speaker 1>the ground.</v>

48
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.610
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to preserve value across time.</v>

49
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.010
<v Speaker 1>And you could say that about your body</v>

50
00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.720
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

51
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.553
<v Speaker 1>It's valuable.</v>

52
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.630
<v Speaker 1>Well in the natural state,</v>

53
00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.070
<v Speaker 1>wolves would be after it,</v>

54
00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.761
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

55
00:01:57.761 --> 00:02:02.761
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to preserve value across time and how you do that.</v>

56
00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.980
<v Speaker 1>There's no sure fire way of doing it,</v>

57
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.740
<v Speaker 1>conservative way of doing it that can fail,</v>

58
00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.860
<v Speaker 1>a risky way of doing it that can succeed.</v>

59
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.510
<v Speaker 1>It also depends on what you mean by success too.</v>

60
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.990
<v Speaker 1>Because to judge whether someone's a winner or loser means you have to set a</v>

61
00:02:19.991 --> 00:02:21.880
<v Speaker 1>priority standards by which to judge them.</v>

62
00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.440
<v Speaker 1>And that is not simple.</v>

63
00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

64
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.350
<v Speaker 1>in our culture where people love celebrities,</v>

65
00:02:26.351 --> 00:02:26.471
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

66
00:02:26.471 --> 00:02:27.850
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to be a celebrity.</v>

67
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:29.373
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

68
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.061
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>

69
00:02:31.061 --> 00:02:32.020
<v Speaker 1>that's what you think.</v>

70
00:02:32.021 --> 00:02:33.250
<v Speaker 1>But Marilyn Monroe's,</v>

71
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.510
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't served well by,</v>

72
00:02:34.511 --> 00:02:36.220
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really look like Elvis was,</v>

73
00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.223
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

74
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.561
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

75
00:02:38.561 --> 00:02:40.990
<v Speaker 1>there's a long list of collapsing celebrities.</v>

76
00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.720
<v Speaker 1>So were they successful?</v>

77
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.200
<v Speaker 1>Not by the standards of reasonable longevity.</v>

78
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.850
<v Speaker 1>They were the,</v>

79
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.070
<v Speaker 1>they were successful by Neil young standards.</v>

80
00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:52.670
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

81
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.190
<v Speaker 1>Better to burn out than to fade away.</v>

82
00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.120
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

83
00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.953
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>

84
00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

85
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.530
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's better to burn bright longer,</v>

86
00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.960
<v Speaker 1>but it's arguable,</v>

87
00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.320
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
