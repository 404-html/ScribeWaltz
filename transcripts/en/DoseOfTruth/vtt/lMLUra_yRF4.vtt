1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.270
<v Speaker 1>As I've mentioned to you before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each of the three aspects of experience,</v>

2
00:00:06.031 --> 00:00:11.031
<v Speaker 1>so the things you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things you don't know and the fact</v>

3
00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:15.090
<v Speaker 1>of yourself have a very ambivalent</v>
<v Speaker 1>underlying structure,</v>

4
00:00:15.091 --> 00:00:19.440
<v Speaker 1>both positive and negative so that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things you don't know are interesting</v>

5
00:00:19.441 --> 00:00:21.600
<v Speaker 1>and compelling and the sources of new</v>
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>

6
00:00:21.601 --> 00:00:26.310
<v Speaker 1>but also the source of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>undermine you both physically and</v>

7
00:00:26.311 --> 00:00:31.260
<v Speaker 1>mentally and the things you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course your culture disciplines you</v>

8
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.490
<v Speaker 1>and shapes you into a full person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also at exactly the same time molds.</v>

9
00:00:40.161 --> 00:00:44.490
<v Speaker 1>Zealand crushes you in a particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>direction rather than any of the other</v>

10
00:00:44.491 --> 00:00:48.180
<v Speaker 1>directions you might have gone in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then finally with regards to the</v>

11
00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:51.810
<v Speaker 1>individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we spent a substantial amount of time</v>

12
00:00:51.811 --> 00:00:56.811
<v Speaker 1>discussing the individual's capability</v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity to make order out of chaos and</v>

13
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.430
<v Speaker 1>sometimes to make chaos out of order in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the service of a higher order and that's</v>

14
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.630
<v Speaker 1>all to the good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just like culture and nature have</v>

15
00:01:06.631 --> 00:01:10.290
<v Speaker 1>there negative aspects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do the individual and I think</v>

16
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.580
<v Speaker 1>personally this is where Christian</v>
<v Speaker 1>mythology in particular comes into its</v>

17
00:01:14.581 --> 00:01:15.414
<v Speaker 1>own.</v>

18
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.370
<v Speaker 1>I think of all the major religions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity has the most thoroughly</v>

19
00:01:22.921 --> 00:01:27.630
<v Speaker 1>developed what you might describe as</v>
<v Speaker 1>formal model of evil,</v>

20
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.190
<v Speaker 1>and that model isn't part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>canonical writings of Christianity,</v>

21
00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:36.340
<v Speaker 1>say encapsulated in the Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but part of the cloud of sort of</v>

22
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.170
<v Speaker 1>unnatural mythology and storytelling</v>
<v Speaker 1>that surrounds the canonical writings,</v>

23
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.500
<v Speaker 1>so you could say that although</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity and Buddhism has spent a</v>

24
00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:50.190
<v Speaker 1>substantial amount of time developing up</v>
<v Speaker 1>a representation of the hero,</v>

25
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.980
<v Speaker 1>Christianity in particular has also</v>
<v Speaker 1>spent a substantial amount of time</v>

26
00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.780
<v Speaker 1>developing a formal portrait of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure that stands in opposition to the</v>

27
00:02:00.781 --> 00:02:05.781
<v Speaker 1>hero and I think the most appropriate</v>
<v Speaker 1>term for that figure who takes multiple</v>

28
00:02:05.791 --> 00:02:08.520
<v Speaker 1>forms in mythology is the adversary</v>
<v Speaker 1>because</v>

29
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.080
<v Speaker 1>the adversarial spirit is a spirit that</v>
<v Speaker 1>stands in opposition to to everything</v>

30
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.820
<v Speaker 1>stands in opposition to nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stands in opposition to culture,</v>

31
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.140
<v Speaker 1>and most specifically stands in</v>
<v Speaker 1>opposition to that aspect of the human</v>

32
00:02:25.141 --> 00:02:25.440
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>

33
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.340
<v Speaker 1>That's both exploratory and creative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

34
00:02:29.341 --> 00:02:34.341
<v Speaker 1>the last time we talked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a chance to describe to you how</v>

35
00:02:35.011 --> 00:02:40.011
<v Speaker 1>the figures of the adversarial brothers</v>
<v Speaker 1>emerged naturally at the end of genesis</v>

36
00:02:40.561 --> 00:02:42.270
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a Coda to the story,</v>

37
00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam and eve developed self</v>

38
00:02:44.161 --> 00:02:46.170
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They develop knowledge of their own</v>

39
00:02:46.171 --> 00:02:51.171
<v Speaker 1>mortality and death and as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>primordial parents of humanity,</v>

40
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.350
<v Speaker 1>their first children take the form of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hostile brothers,</v>

41
00:02:55.351 --> 00:02:59.010
<v Speaker 1>which is to say that if you're the child</v>
<v Speaker 1>of nature and the child of culture,</v>

42
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.020
<v Speaker 1>the sort of ultimate parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then as an individual,</v>

43
00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:07.000
<v Speaker 1>you take two forms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a positive form in a negative form,</v>

44
00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:11.590
<v Speaker 1>and the negative form is characterized</v>
<v Speaker 1>in many ways by a kind of absolute</v>

45
00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:14.920
<v Speaker 1>hatred of the good hatred of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive form.</v>

46
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.400
<v Speaker 1>And I think that you can't understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>the full human propensity for evil</v>

47
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.200
<v Speaker 1>without considering more than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>territory,</v>

48
00:03:26.201 --> 00:03:29.390
<v Speaker 1>lot more than the innate territoriality</v>
<v Speaker 1>of human beings.</v>

49
00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.610
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

50
00:03:30.611 --> 00:03:35.611
<v Speaker 1>animals are territorial and they fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>to preserve their territory and it's</v>

51
00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:38.650
<v Speaker 1>irrational struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're fighting for resources and for a</v>

52
00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:43.160
<v Speaker 1>place that they can that they can</v>
<v Speaker 1>operate and live in and reproduce in</v>

53
00:03:43.161 --> 00:03:46.240
<v Speaker 1>efficiently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But human beings are substantively</v>

54
00:03:46.241 --> 00:03:50.080
<v Speaker 1>different from that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that there are agonistic conflict.</v>

55
00:03:50.081 --> 00:03:54.700
<v Speaker 1>Their aggression often seems to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivated by something more akin to the</v>

56
00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:57.960
<v Speaker 1>pure desire for destruction rather than</v>
<v Speaker 1>for any rational landlord.</v>

57
00:03:57.961 --> 00:04:01.420
<v Speaker 1>So ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so from that perspective,</v>

58
00:04:01.421 --> 00:04:06.421
<v Speaker 1>I would say as an example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that Hitler ended up committing</v>

59
00:04:07.691 --> 00:04:12.190
<v Speaker 1>suicide in a bunker beneath Germany's</v>
<v Speaker 1>capital at the end of the Second World</v>

60
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.310
<v Speaker 1>War when Berlin was in flames when all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Germany was in flames and when his</v>

61
00:04:15.311 --> 00:04:18.370
<v Speaker 1>country was completely defeated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after tens of millions of people had</v>

62
00:04:18.371 --> 00:04:22.150
<v Speaker 1>died in the conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including of course the 7 million or so</v>

63
00:04:22.151 --> 00:04:23.890
<v Speaker 1>people that were killed in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holocaust.</v>

64
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.350
<v Speaker 1>The normal mode of interpretation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be what a terrible defeat for</v>

65
00:04:29.351 --> 00:04:31.390
<v Speaker 1>Hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But an equally valid.</v>

66
00:04:31.391 --> 00:04:35.260
<v Speaker 1>And I think an equally valid prima facie</v>
<v Speaker 1>argument.</v>

67
00:04:35.261 --> 00:04:38.500
<v Speaker 1>And one I think that's actually more</v>
<v Speaker 1>valid is that it wasn't a defeat for</v>

68
00:04:38.501 --> 00:04:41.680
<v Speaker 1>Hitler at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was precisely what he was aiming at</v>

69
00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:46.681
<v Speaker 1>right from the beginning because his</v>
<v Speaker 1>mode of being was intensely adversarial.</v>

70
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.340
<v Speaker 1>And I would also say that it's certainly</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible that the full nature of his</v>

71
00:04:51.341 --> 00:04:56.341
<v Speaker 1>motivations weren't even necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>clear to him as they unfolded across</v>

72
00:04:57.011 --> 00:05:00.400
<v Speaker 1>time during the Second World War.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No more than the full motivations of any</v>

73
00:05:00.401 --> 00:05:04.120
<v Speaker 1>human being are necessarily accessible</v>
<v Speaker 1>to them as they act out,</v>

74
00:05:04.121 --> 00:05:06.550
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is that they act out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Carl Jung says,</v>

75
00:05:06.551 --> 00:05:09.790
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we act out great mythological</v>

76
00:05:09.791 --> 00:05:12.850
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't necessarily mean you know</v>

77
00:05:12.851 --> 00:05:14.680
<v Speaker 1>the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just means he act it out.</v>

78
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.500
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see people whose lives are</v>

79
00:05:17.501 --> 00:05:22.501
<v Speaker 1>repetitive bouts of tragedy and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're acting out is a tragic story and</v>

80
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.810
<v Speaker 1>they know it in so far as they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually acting it out,</v>

81
00:05:25.811 --> 00:05:30.010
<v Speaker 1>but they don't necessarily have an</v>
<v Speaker 1>explicit model of the relationship</v>

82
00:05:30.011 --> 00:05:33.010
<v Speaker 1>between their patterns of behavior and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the constantly tragic outcomes they</v>

83
00:05:33.011 --> 00:05:33.844
<v Speaker 1>produce.</v>

84
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't even necessarily mean that</v>

85
00:05:35.891 --> 00:05:39.520
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing isn't voluntary</v>
<v Speaker 1>because things can be voluntary even if</v>

86
00:05:39.521 --> 00:05:44.470
<v Speaker 1>you don't understand them fully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an aspect to the human psyche</v>

87
00:05:44.471 --> 00:05:46.570
<v Speaker 1>that's a nest of vipers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

88
00:05:46.571 --> 00:05:49.870
<v Speaker 1>because you can't necessarily trust what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see.</v>

89
00:05:49.871 --> 00:05:52.180
<v Speaker 1>And that means not only when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at someone else say,</v>

90
00:05:52.181 --> 00:05:53.530
<v Speaker 1>but even when you're looking in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mirror,</v>

91
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.980
<v Speaker 1>you can't be sure that what you say</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing is exactly what you're.</v>

92
00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.860
<v Speaker 1>Your motivations aren't transparent and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they may not even be clear.</v>

93
00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.920
<v Speaker 1>So I suppose the idea that lurks behind</v>
<v Speaker 1>this formalization is that freedom of</v>

94
00:06:11.081 --> 00:06:16.081
<v Speaker 1>choice is such a good that one of its</v>
<v Speaker 1>subsidiary necessities,</v>

95
00:06:16.721 --> 00:06:21.460
<v Speaker 1>which is that there has to be a polar</v>
<v Speaker 1>distinction between good and evil is</v>

96
00:06:21.461 --> 00:06:24.100
<v Speaker 1>worth having.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freedom is so important that it</v>

97
00:06:24.101 --> 00:06:26.590
<v Speaker 1>justifies the distinction between good</v>
<v Speaker 1>and evil.</v>

98
00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.190
<v Speaker 1>And I think that art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a reasonable way to</v>

99
00:06:30.191 --> 00:06:31.024
<v Speaker 1>presume</v>

100
00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.620
<v Speaker 1>it's reasonable to presume that that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the manner in which experience is</v>

101
00:06:37.621 --> 00:06:40.390
<v Speaker 1>actually structured and there's complex</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons for that.</v>

102
00:06:40.391 --> 00:06:44.140
<v Speaker 1>One would be that under the most optimal</v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances,</v>

103
00:06:44.141 --> 00:06:47.470
<v Speaker 1>which is something we'll talk about as</v>
<v Speaker 1>this proceeds to a close,</v>

104
00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.260
<v Speaker 1>that means in a sense you can have your</v>
<v Speaker 1>cake and eat it too,</v>

105
00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:55.030
<v Speaker 1>which means the potential existence of</v>
<v Speaker 1>good and evil allows for freedom of</v>

106
00:06:55.031 --> 00:06:57.820
<v Speaker 1>choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if the choice is always towards</v>

107
00:06:57.821 --> 00:07:00.580
<v Speaker 1>the good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have the benefits of freedom.</v>

108
00:07:00.581 --> 00:07:04.210
<v Speaker 1>Of choice plus the benefits of the good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only price you have to pay is the</v>

109
00:07:04.211 --> 00:07:07.570
<v Speaker 1>constant possibility of evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very much like the structure of</v>

110
00:07:07.571 --> 00:07:12.280
<v Speaker 1>Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have the highest God whose whose</v>

111
00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:16.390
<v Speaker 1>highest son is Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have the figure of Satan lurking</v>

112
00:07:16.391 --> 00:07:19.600
<v Speaker 1>in the background who's also got a</v>
<v Speaker 1>filial relationship with the highest</v>

113
00:07:19.601 --> 00:07:22.240
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes for a confusing kind of</v>

114
00:07:22.241 --> 00:07:24.850
<v Speaker 1>theology because in many situations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

115
00:07:24.851 --> 00:07:28.900
<v Speaker 1>Christ is identified specifically with</v>
<v Speaker 1>God the father,</v>

116
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:31.390
<v Speaker 1>but Satan always lurks in the background</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his.</v>

117
00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:36.220
<v Speaker 1>His existential status is indeterminant</v>
<v Speaker 1>because since God is everything,</v>

118
00:07:36.221 --> 00:07:39.490
<v Speaker 1>then it's very difficult to make the</v>
<v Speaker 1>case that the evil spirit isn't a</v>

119
00:07:39.491 --> 00:07:42.640
<v Speaker 1>derivative of God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not easy thing to get straightened</v>

120
00:07:42.641 --> 00:07:46.420
<v Speaker 1>out rationally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think Milton in paradise lost as a</v>

121
00:07:46.421 --> 00:07:49.930
<v Speaker 1>very good attempt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes a very good attempt to explain</v>

122
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.930
<v Speaker 1>exactly what this might mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how there could be an overarching</v>

123
00:07:52.931 --> 00:07:57.190
<v Speaker 1>transcendent power and there could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>two subordinate elements to that one</v>

124
00:07:57.191 --> 00:08:02.191
<v Speaker 1>evil in one good without destroying the</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that God as such as good and with</v>

125
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.610
<v Speaker 1>out eradicating the reality of evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

126
00:08:06.611 --> 00:08:11.611
<v Speaker 1>very complex argument to make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the notion of evil is also very,</v>

127
00:08:11.981 --> 00:08:15.220
<v Speaker 1>very complex idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you look at our arguments that</v>

128
00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.440
<v Speaker 1>support atheism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've mentioned some of these like</v>

129
00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:21.220
<v Speaker 1>Ivan's argument in the brothers</v>
<v Speaker 1>Karamazov where Ivan says,</v>

130
00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:24.280
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world in as such experience as such</v>

131
00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:28.180
<v Speaker 1>must be evil because it's predicated on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the blood of innocence,</v>

132
00:08:28.181 --> 00:08:29.290
<v Speaker 1>the suffering of children.</v>

133
00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:33.190
<v Speaker 1>The fact that there's vast injustices in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world is indicative that there is no</v>

134
00:08:33.191 --> 00:08:38.191
<v Speaker 1>such thing as a good God or to speak</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless personified terms is evidence</v>

135
00:08:38.261 --> 00:08:42.070
<v Speaker 1>that the structure of experience as such</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an untenable morally,</v>

136
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:45.340
<v Speaker 1>it shouldn't be because it's predicated</v>
<v Speaker 1>on suffering.</v>

137
00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:47.950
<v Speaker 1>Jeffrey Burton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russell,</v>

138
00:08:47.951 --> 00:08:50.410
<v Speaker 1>who's written a whole series of books on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nature of evil,</v>

139
00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:55.580
<v Speaker 1>makes a very clear distinction between</v>
<v Speaker 1>different categories of terrible that I</v>

140
00:08:55.621 --> 00:08:57.690
<v Speaker 1>hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think help bring this into clarity,</v>

141
00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:00.960
<v Speaker 1>so imagine this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine first that it's useful to make a</v>

142
00:09:00.961 --> 00:09:03.780
<v Speaker 1>distinction between tragedy and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

143
00:09:03.781 --> 00:09:08.781
<v Speaker 1>Now tragedy is when the bad befalls the</v>
<v Speaker 1>good an earthquake is tragic.</v>

144
00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:12.600
<v Speaker 1>So or diseases tragic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's easy to regard a disease or an</v>

145
00:09:12.601 --> 00:09:14.850
<v Speaker 1>earthquake as evil as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the problem with that is that</v>

146
00:09:14.851 --> 00:09:18.120
<v Speaker 1>doesn't seem to be any motivation to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it's more likely,</v>

147
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.860
<v Speaker 1>it's more reasonable to think something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

148
00:09:19.861 --> 00:09:22.050
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are vulnerable.</v>

149
00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.770
<v Speaker 1>They have to be vulnerable in order to</v>
<v Speaker 1>give existence a viewpoint.</v>

150
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:30.570
<v Speaker 1>One of the consequences of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability is that they're</v>

151
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:32.460
<v Speaker 1>susceptible to tragedy.</v>

152
00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.233
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

153
00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:38.030
<v Speaker 1>If their vulnerability is a precondition</v>
<v Speaker 1>for being,</v>

154
00:09:38.031 --> 00:09:41.230
<v Speaker 1>then the fact that they're susceptible</v>
<v Speaker 1>to tragedy isn't necessarily an evil.</v>

155
00:09:41.231 --> 00:09:44.050
<v Speaker 1>It's just a consequence of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>limitation.</v>

156
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:46.861
<v Speaker 1>Then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

157
00:09:46.861 --> 00:09:49.410
<v Speaker 1>what constitutes evil?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can't put earthquakes and</v>

158
00:09:49.411 --> 00:09:51.540
<v Speaker 1>diseases and so forth into that</v>
<v Speaker 1>category,</v>

159
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.350
<v Speaker 1>well then it seems to be something more</v>
<v Speaker 1>dependent on choice,</v>

160
00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.510
<v Speaker 1>which is the argument that Elliot is</v>
<v Speaker 1>making.</v>

161
00:09:57.511 --> 00:10:01.650
<v Speaker 1>Say the world does all sorts of terrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>things to people,</v>

162
00:10:01.651 --> 00:10:06.370
<v Speaker 1>but there are frequent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's frequently the case that people act</v>

163
00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:08.930
<v Speaker 1>in such a way to make things worse</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than better.</v>

164
00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:12.950
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at the consequences of</v>

165
00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:15.370
<v Speaker 1>the rise to power of the Nazis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

166
00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:19.430
<v Speaker 1>doesn't seem reasonable to put the Nazi</v>
<v Speaker 1>concentration camp in the same category</v>

167
00:10:19.431 --> 00:10:21.860
<v Speaker 1>from an ethical perspective as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>earthquake,</v>

168
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:26.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the earthquake is and emergent</v>

169
00:10:26.901 --> 00:10:30.590
<v Speaker 1>consequence of the rules that governed</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical existence.</v>

170
00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.680
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the Nazi death camp is something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was planned.</v>

171
00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:38.120
<v Speaker 1>It didn't have to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be an aspect of choice and</v>

172
00:10:38.121 --> 00:10:42.610
<v Speaker 1>this seems to be the idea that's lurking</v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath both this mythology and now</v>

173
00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.030
<v Speaker 1>he had his comment on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>

174
00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:46.970
<v Speaker 1>the mere fact that the world is</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible,</v>

175
00:10:46.971 --> 00:10:49.940
<v Speaker 1>does not mean that it's evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then when you look at specifically</v>

176
00:10:49.941 --> 00:10:52.700
<v Speaker 1>human actions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this aspect of twisted choice</v>

177
00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:54.500
<v Speaker 1>that fry also makes much of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>

178
00:10:54.501 --> 00:10:56.240
<v Speaker 1>if you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the structure of human</v>

179
00:10:56.241 --> 00:11:01.241
<v Speaker 1>history and you try to explain why it</v>
<v Speaker 1>has such a bloody and terrible course,</v>

180
00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:06.680
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't seem sufficient just to</v>
<v Speaker 1>attribute it say to the conditions of</v>

181
00:11:06.681 --> 00:11:11.540
<v Speaker 1>existence or to ignorance it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems more like there's a force</v>

182
00:11:11.541 --> 00:11:12.770
<v Speaker 1>behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

183
00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:13.511
<v Speaker 1>manifests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

184
00:11:13.511 --> 00:11:18.230
<v Speaker 1>and every individual that's actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>aiming at the suffering instead of just</v>

185
00:11:18.231 --> 00:11:21.200
<v Speaker 1>allowing it to happen or instead of not</v>
<v Speaker 1>stepping in to stop it,</v>

186
00:11:21.201 --> 00:11:22.430
<v Speaker 1>but actually aiming at it.</v>
