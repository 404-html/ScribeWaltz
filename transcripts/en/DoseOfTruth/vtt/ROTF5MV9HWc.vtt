00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:27.290
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.913
<v Speaker 1>well it's,</v>

3
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:37.861
<v Speaker 1>it's stressful.</v>

4
00:00:37.861 --> 00:00:39.520
<v Speaker 1>I suppose in some ways it'd be,</v>

5
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.440
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.130
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

7
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't find these,</v>

8
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.930
<v Speaker 1>these parks particularly stressful because they're so positive.</v>

9
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.370
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

10
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.240
<v Speaker 1>I like to come up and talk about the things that I've learned</v>

11
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.940
<v Speaker 1>a few people here and to have a serious discussion about things that would help</v>

12
00:00:58.321 --> 00:01:02.400
<v Speaker 1>orient us in the world and to push what I know farther ahead.</v>

13
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.740
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

14
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.250
<v Speaker 1>it's so positive that I don't really think about this.</v>

15
00:01:09.251 --> 00:01:13.410
<v Speaker 1>Certainly this part of it that stressful facing journalists is stressful.</v>

16
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.290
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

17
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.573
<v Speaker 1>usually</v>

18
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:20.440
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

19
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.273
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

20
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how I have mine from that or you should go sleep afterwards I guess</v>

21
00:01:25.951 --> 00:01:26.784
<v Speaker 1>is what I do.</v>

22
00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.540
<v Speaker 1>That helps.</v>

23
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.373
<v Speaker 1>That's helpful.</v>

24
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.573
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

25
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.720
<v Speaker 1>what I do to</v>

26
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.590
<v Speaker 1>increase my ability to tolerate the activities that I'm engaged in,</v>

27
00:01:37.591 --> 00:01:41.790
<v Speaker 1>this drama with my wife and she's extremely helpful cause she's very level</v>

28
00:01:41.791 --> 00:01:42.624
<v Speaker 1>headed.</v>

29
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.780
<v Speaker 1>I have an extra brain along which is a useful thing and we sweat sometimes we</v>

30
00:01:48.431 --> 00:01:49.340
<v Speaker 1>the workout with him.</v>

31
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.100
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes we go for a drive when we can do that and we go for a walk and I spend</v>

32
00:01:53.101 --> 00:01:54.060
<v Speaker 1>time with my family.</v>

33
00:01:54.061 --> 00:01:54.840
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

34
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.673
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

35
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.020
<v Speaker 1>those are all good things,</v>

36
00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.543
<v Speaker 1>but I go,</v>

37
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.950
<v Speaker 1>life is stressful.</v>

38
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:03.120
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

39
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.120
<v Speaker 1>and at least I'm in a position where whatever I'm doing new stressful is</v>

40
00:02:08.971 --> 00:02:12.630
<v Speaker 1>counterbalanced by exactly what that talk from all of you tonight.</v>

41
00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.473
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

42
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.190
<v Speaker 1>it's deep.</v>

43
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.240
<v Speaker 1>What I'm doing,</v>

44
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.400
<v Speaker 1>what I'm engaged in is deeply meaningful.</v>

45
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.110
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a pleasure to be able to share that with other people and to see</v>

46
00:02:24.391 --> 00:02:28.800
<v Speaker 1>that sense of meaningful engagement and develop more people.</v>

47
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.010
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>

48
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.290
<v Speaker 1>I can't think of anything better to do than that,</v>

49
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.260
<v Speaker 1>which is why I'm doing what I'm doing tonight,</v>

50
00:02:37.261 --> 00:02:37.930
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

51
00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.660
<v Speaker 1>because I can't think of anything better than sitting here and talking to all of</v>

52
00:02:42.661 --> 00:02:47.661
<v Speaker 1>you about these things that are necessary to understand and to lay out in the</v>

53
00:02:47.911 --> 00:02:48.660
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

54
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.493
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

55
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.400
<v Speaker 1>what do I do to unwind?</v>

56
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.410
<v Speaker 1>I think I do what you shouldn't do if you want to unwind.</v>

57
00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.290
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

58
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying my best to make things better</v>

59
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.010
<v Speaker 1>because it seems to me that would be better than this thing with feathers.</v>

60
00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.830
<v Speaker 1>And I have some sense of how bad things can be because I've studied how bad</v>

61
00:03:13.831 --> 00:03:17.520
<v Speaker 1>things can be experienced in my own personal life.</v>

62
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.200
<v Speaker 1>Some of them with my clients because I've been in very dark places with my</v>

63
00:03:22.201 --> 00:03:25.440
<v Speaker 1>clients and in my own life from time to time,</v>

64
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.050
<v Speaker 1>certainly in my studies.</v>

65
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.070
<v Speaker 1>And I grabbed him that everything did you go to hell in a hand basket like in</v>

66
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.913
<v Speaker 1>code?</v>

67
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.120
<v Speaker 1>And I would like it if everyone got on the board and we all decided to make</v>

68
00:03:39.751 --> 00:03:40.740
<v Speaker 1>things better.</v>

69
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.830
<v Speaker 1>Each of us started with our own lives and facilitating that is</v>

70
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.130
<v Speaker 1>the afternoon to the catastrophe.</v>

71
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.180
<v Speaker 1>So that's a continual unwinding in a sense.</v>

72
00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.530
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

73
00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.530
<v Speaker 1>and it's a privilege to be able to take part in m to also see this amazing thing</v>

74
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.310
<v Speaker 1>we developed in for a long time.</v>

75
00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.070
<v Speaker 1>And now I started doing these lectures.</v>

76
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.120
<v Speaker 1>Public lectures would be last year I did a series on the Bible.</v>

77
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.360
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was really at that because,</v>

78
00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:17.590
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

79
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.430
<v Speaker 1>well think about it is I decided to do a series of lectures.</v>

80
00:04:21.431 --> 00:04:25.180
<v Speaker 1>So I rented this theater and I decided that I wanted to do lectures.</v>

81
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.010
<v Speaker 1>On Genesis sections of what responsibilities,</v>

82
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.340
<v Speaker 1>starting with genesis.</v>

83
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.950
<v Speaker 1>And then I would do that publicly and then a whole bunch of people came,</v>

84
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:36.091
<v Speaker 1>no one.</v>

85
00:04:36.091 --> 00:04:37.120
<v Speaker 1>So that was pretty weird.</v>

86
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.970
<v Speaker 1>That young man's where exactly.</v>

87
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.900
<v Speaker 1>If not the people who would ever to do that.</v>

88
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.990
<v Speaker 1>Lots of people have to 1,000,002 and a half million people have watched the</v>

89
00:04:46.991 --> 00:04:47.920
<v Speaker 1>first of those lectures.</v>

90
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.530
<v Speaker 1>It's on the first sentence of Genesis.</v>

91
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.890
<v Speaker 1>So to mount to an,</v>

92
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.770
<v Speaker 1>and people have watched for three hour lecture on one sentence</v>

93
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.570
<v Speaker 1>from the first story in the Bible.</v>

94
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.780
<v Speaker 1>It's completely ridiculous.</v>

95
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:05.810
<v Speaker 1>When I went home,</v>

96
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.630
<v Speaker 1>launched the publicists in London,</v>

97
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.560
<v Speaker 1>rented and speaker so that I can talk about it sold out right away.</v>

98
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.460
<v Speaker 1>So then they rented number one for the next day and it's sold out right away</v>

99
00:05:18.461 --> 00:05:19.810
<v Speaker 1>until they read one the next week.</v>

100
00:05:19.811 --> 00:05:20.950
<v Speaker 1>And it's salt though too.</v>

101
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.350
<v Speaker 1>And then the same thing happened in Amsterdam.</v>

102
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.060
<v Speaker 1>And then I thought,</v>

103
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.770
<v Speaker 1>well that's interesting.</v>

104
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:28.970
<v Speaker 1>So about 15 zero units,</v>

105
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:34.500
<v Speaker 1>50 theatrical performances in Toronto and in Europe.</v>

106
00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.230
<v Speaker 1>I can probably go wherever it wants the world and we'll talk about what I want</v>

107
00:05:38.231 --> 00:05:38.711
<v Speaker 1>to talk about,</v>

108
00:05:38.711 --> 00:05:39.840
<v Speaker 1>how much people will come.</v>

109
00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.960
<v Speaker 1>So I thought,</v>

110
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:41.051
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

111
00:05:41.051 --> 00:05:42.160
<v Speaker 1>I might as well try that.</v>

112
00:05:42.161 --> 00:05:42.994
<v Speaker 1>That's</v>

113
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.070
<v Speaker 1>my wife and I have been in,</v>

114
00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.100
<v Speaker 1>I think this is the 58 city in four months.</v>

115
00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.040
<v Speaker 1>And so here you all are.</v>

116
00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:02.120
<v Speaker 1>We're having a very serious conversation is properly in the world.</v>

117
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.970
<v Speaker 1>And so that's not stressful,</v>

118
00:06:04.971 --> 00:06:05.240
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

119
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.560
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>

120
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.340
<v Speaker 1>So it compared,</v>

121
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:17.050
<v Speaker 1>there's so much worth catastrophe in the world to be involved in a continual</v>

122
00:06:19.341 --> 00:06:23.510
<v Speaker 1>conversation with thousands of people about how each of our individual lives</v>

123
00:06:23.511 --> 00:06:27.350
<v Speaker 1>might be better and how that could spread into our families,</v>

124
00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.210
<v Speaker 1>into the broader community.</v>

125
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:30.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's not stressful.</v>

126
00:06:30.801 --> 00:06:32.420
<v Speaker 1>That's the opposite of stressful.</v>

127
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:34.190
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>

128
00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:34.940
<v Speaker 1>Wonderful.</v>

129
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:35.840
<v Speaker 1>It's so positive.</v>

130
00:06:35.841 --> 00:06:37.070
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe it.</v>

131
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:37.963
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

132
00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.660
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to my son the other day this morning,</v>

133
00:06:41.661 --> 00:06:42.494
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

134
00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:47.690
<v Speaker 1>and it was this morning [inaudible] he gave,</v>

135
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.430
<v Speaker 1>he gave to the pay with tabby and I,</v>

136
00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.010
<v Speaker 1>and we had a hell of a trip man from New York,</v>

137
00:06:55.011 --> 00:06:55.521
<v Speaker 1>from Dublin,</v>

138
00:06:55.521 --> 00:06:56.540
<v Speaker 1>and then to London.</v>

139
00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:00.880
<v Speaker 1>And so in Dublin I talked to Sam Harris and Douglas Murray,</v>

140
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.540
<v Speaker 1>8,500 people showed up wearing this big stadium was like the biggest</v>

141
00:07:05.541 --> 00:07:06.920
<v Speaker 1>philosophical discussion.</v>

142
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.680
<v Speaker 1>I think it was the biggest public philosophical discussion,</v>

143
00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:14.740
<v Speaker 1>not like close it [inaudible] if it was that would be the biggest event.</v>

144
00:07:18.571 --> 00:07:23.571
<v Speaker 1>And that was like all these people showed up cavernous Rena to him to hear a</v>

145
00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:29.030
<v Speaker 1>very difficult discussion about the relationship between facts and values and</v>

146
00:07:29.031 --> 00:07:30.270
<v Speaker 1>religion and science.</v>

147
00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.090
<v Speaker 1>They were like right into,</v>

148
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:32.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

149
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:36.200
<v Speaker 1>we were going to switch to Q and a after an hour of discussion,</v>

150
00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.630
<v Speaker 1>but the audience voted overwhelmingly,</v>

151
00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:39.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

152
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.970
<v Speaker 1>by clapping too,</v>

153
00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.490
<v Speaker 1>to continue the conversations.</v>

154
00:07:43.491 --> 00:07:46.510
<v Speaker 1>And we talked for two and a half hours and everyone was like right on the board.</v>

155
00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:50.270
<v Speaker 1>And so it just turns out that people are lot smarter than we thought.</v>

156
00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:51.320
<v Speaker 1>There's a huge,</v>

157
00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:52.633
<v Speaker 1>huge,</v>

158
00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.260
<v Speaker 1>well I think TV,</v>

159
00:07:54.261 --> 00:07:56.480
<v Speaker 1>the narrow bandwidth of TV maybe made a mistake.</v>

160
00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.340
<v Speaker 1>We were stupid and we're actually not.</v>

161
00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:02.510
<v Speaker 1>And so there's this massive public hungered for detail and,</v>

162
00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.340
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

163
00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:06.550
<v Speaker 1>and reasonably deep philosophical discussions like,</v>

164
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.120
<v Speaker 1>well that's helping with leasing things.</v>

165
00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:13.570
<v Speaker 1>So that was just the one belief [inaudible] we get that.</v>

166
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:20.930
<v Speaker 1>And I was crazily exciting,</v>

167
00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:25.150
<v Speaker 1>ridiculously adventurous and the talk went really well and will take,</v>

168
00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:25.880
<v Speaker 1>hopefully,</v>

169
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:26.391
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

170
00:08:26.391 --> 00:08:28.780
<v Speaker 1>that the me in August and that people can see what they,</v>

171
00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:32.630
<v Speaker 1>and when there was a discussion about the relative merits of an atheist</v>

172
00:08:32.631 --> 00:08:33.790
<v Speaker 1>materialist viewpoint,</v>

173
00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:36.530
<v Speaker 1>let's call it cultural religious traditions,</v>

174
00:08:36.531 --> 00:08:38.780
<v Speaker 1>religious viewpoint.</v>

175
00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.670
<v Speaker 1>And we had a good discussion.</v>

176
00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:43.610
<v Speaker 1>We consider yourself both sides of that argument.</v>

177
00:08:43.611 --> 00:08:44.210
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

178
00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:44.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

179
00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:47.420
<v Speaker 1>with any luck and a couple of billion people will watch those videos and they</v>

180
00:08:47.421 --> 00:08:50.330
<v Speaker 1>can have a discussion about it and they do the concern himself up property.</v>

181
00:08:50.331 --> 00:08:55.331
<v Speaker 1>And then we went to London and did the same thing again along with a variety of</v>

182
00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:58.710
<v Speaker 1>other activities.</v>

183
00:08:59.370 --> 00:08:59.851
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

184
00:08:59.851 --> 00:09:04.280
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to my son about this morning and he's a pretty tough kid and</v>

185
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:05.540
<v Speaker 1>pretty levelheaded.</v>

186
00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:06.880
<v Speaker 1>And when he was talking about it,</v>

187
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:09.750
<v Speaker 1>it made him broke down at the rate of crime.</v>

188
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:10.980
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

189
00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:14.370
<v Speaker 1>and the reason for that is because it's absolutely overwhelming to watch this</v>

190
00:09:14.371 --> 00:09:14.761
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

191
00:09:14.761 --> 00:09:16.140
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe.</v>

192
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:17.760
<v Speaker 1>So it's not stressful.</v>

193
00:09:17.761 --> 00:09:18.140
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

194
00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:18.973
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

195
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:21.860
<v Speaker 1>it's a privilege to be doing this.</v>

196
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:22.703
<v Speaker 1>It's an ounce,</v>

197
00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:23.180
<v Speaker 1>lucky,</v>

198
00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:28.180
<v Speaker 1>privileged to be doing this and that sold [inaudible].</v>
