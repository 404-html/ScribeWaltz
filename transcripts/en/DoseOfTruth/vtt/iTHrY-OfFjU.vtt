00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.690
<v Speaker 1>You mentioned analyzing one of your wife's dreams that left you feeling hopeful</v>

2
00:00:11.691 --> 00:00:13.370
<v Speaker 1>that will emerge from this chaos.</v>

3
00:00:13.371 --> 00:00:14.204
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.680
<v Speaker 1>Do you still feel this way?</v>

5
00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.240
<v Speaker 1>Any new signs?</v>

6
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:18.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

7
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:19.341
<v Speaker 1>who knows,</v>

8
00:00:19.341 --> 00:00:19.641
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

9
00:00:19.641 --> 00:00:23.570
<v Speaker 1>Because because the future is complicated and no one's a profit.</v>

10
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to think.</v>

11
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.081
<v Speaker 1>I think this,</v>

12
00:00:27.081 --> 00:00:32.081
<v Speaker 1>I guess I already mentioned earlier in this Q and a that on a global level there</v>

13
00:00:37.191 --> 00:00:41.150
<v Speaker 1>is all sorts of reasons for real optimism as far as I'm concerned.</v>

14
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.130
<v Speaker 1>There's reasons for pessimism as well,</v>

15
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.340
<v Speaker 1>but there's reasons for real optimism and what,</v>

16
00:00:46.341 --> 00:00:47.030
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

17
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.230
<v Speaker 1>it looks to me like what's happening is that the spread of</v>

18
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.260
<v Speaker 1>the western free market,</v>

19
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.470
<v Speaker 1>individualist ethos around the world is producing a substantive increment in</v>

20
00:01:03.531 --> 00:01:04.190
<v Speaker 1>wealth,</v>

21
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.170
<v Speaker 1>a substantive decrease in poverty,</v>

22
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.740
<v Speaker 1>and the consequence of that decrease in poverty is also in places like China,</v>

23
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.651
<v Speaker 1>which by the way,</v>

24
00:01:12.651 --> 00:01:14.090
<v Speaker 1>China is reforesting,</v>

25
00:01:14.091 --> 00:01:15.200
<v Speaker 1>so that's pretty interesting.</v>

26
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.950
<v Speaker 1>China's now rich enough so that it can afford to reforest too.</v>

27
00:01:18.951 --> 00:01:22.790
<v Speaker 1>There's more forest in China than there was in 1990 which is quite a remarkable</v>

28
00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:23.360
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

29
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.781
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

30
00:01:23.781 --> 00:01:24.441
<v Speaker 1>my point is,</v>

31
00:01:24.441 --> 00:01:26.330
<v Speaker 1>is that on the global scale,</v>

32
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.030
<v Speaker 1>things appeared to be very positive</v>

33
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:31.220
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

34
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.220
<v Speaker 1>but then in the West we seem to be suffering from a crisis of confidence and</v>

35
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.330
<v Speaker 1>that's destabilizing us and making us act foolishly.</v>

36
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.830
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know how much of a threat that is to the integrity of our political</v>

37
00:01:45.831 --> 00:01:46.664
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

38
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:47.733
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

39
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.800
<v Speaker 1>and I'm so much in the middle of this let's say,</v>

40
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.633
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

41
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.440
<v Speaker 1>personally that it's hard for me to have a clear head about it.</v>

42
00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.660
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm very optimistic about a variety of things that I see.</v>

43
00:02:02.661 --> 00:02:03.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm very optimistic,</v>

44
00:02:03.741 --> 00:02:04.281
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

45
00:02:04.281 --> 00:02:09.281
<v Speaker 1>about the fact that so many people have are coming out to these long form</v>

46
00:02:09.621 --> 00:02:14.621
<v Speaker 1>lectures and paying attention to high complexity,</v>

47
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.470
<v Speaker 1>educational and political material on Youtube.</v>

48
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.940
<v Speaker 1>There's a real hunger for that.</v>

49
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.590
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

50
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:22.820
<v Speaker 1>as I said before,</v>

51
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.670
<v Speaker 1>the lecture tour that I'm on has been extremely positive.</v>

52
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.900
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

53
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.260
<v Speaker 1>it's really something to see all these thousands of people come out to</v>

54
00:02:30.261 --> 00:02:33.020
<v Speaker 1>concentrate on getting their lives together.</v>

55
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.360
<v Speaker 1>And I do believe that that's why people are coming out.</v>

56
00:02:35.361 --> 00:02:35.571
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

57
00:02:35.571 --> 00:02:36.404
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

58
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:37.483
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

59
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember if I did a Q and a since I did the discussions with Sam Harris,</v>

60
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.601
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

61
00:02:44.601 --> 00:02:45.434
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

62
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.530
<v Speaker 1>I did for discussions with him for debates,</v>

63
00:02:48.531 --> 00:02:51.290
<v Speaker 1>let's say each of which was about two hours long,</v>

64
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.460
<v Speaker 1>two in Vancouver,</v>

65
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.470
<v Speaker 1>one in Dublin and one in London,</v>

66
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.460
<v Speaker 1>UK.</v>

67
00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.150
<v Speaker 1>And there were about 3000 people at each of the Vancouver 8,500 people in Dublin</v>

68
00:03:01.721 --> 00:03:04.660
<v Speaker 1>and something approximating 6,500 in London.</v>

69
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.170
<v Speaker 1>And the audience was very attentive for the two hour stretch for all four</v>

70
00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:11.620
<v Speaker 1>discussions.</v>

71
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.290
<v Speaker 1>And so I do see the,</v>

72
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.550
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

73
00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.550
<v Speaker 1>I see more intelligence in the general population say then I think we presumed</v>

74
00:03:24.051 --> 00:03:26.930
<v Speaker 1>was there and more hunger for serious discussion.</v>

75
00:03:26.931 --> 00:03:31.931
<v Speaker 1>And I'm hoping that people who are clear headed and sensible can push back the</v>

76
00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.730
<v Speaker 1>idiot collectivist radicals on the left and on the right.</v>

77
00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:42.403
<v Speaker 1>We'll see.</v>

78
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.100
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

79
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.933
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

80
00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.931
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

81
00:03:44.931 --> 00:03:49.931
<v Speaker 1>I'm hopeful because I think that people are remarkable creatures despite their</v>

82
00:03:50.061 --> 00:03:55.061
<v Speaker 1>limitations and the absurdity of our existence and our proclivity toward</v>

83
00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:56.271
<v Speaker 1>malevolence.</v>

84
00:03:56.271 --> 00:03:57.590
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

85
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.580
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

86
00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:02.420
<v Speaker 1>we can,</v>

87
00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.190
<v Speaker 1>whatever constitutes our essence is capable of transcending that.</v>

88
00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.710
<v Speaker 1>And I think that people know that.</v>

89
00:04:09.711 --> 00:04:13.400
<v Speaker 1>And I think the more people that realize that consciously and start to implement</v>

90
00:04:13.401 --> 00:04:13.491
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

91
00:04:13.491 --> 00:04:14.540
<v Speaker 1>the better off we'll be.</v>

92
00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.870
<v Speaker 1>And so nested inside my extreme pessimism about the structure of life and the</v>

93
00:04:20.631 --> 00:04:24.260
<v Speaker 1>frailty of human character is an acceptable optimism,</v>

94
00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.500
<v Speaker 1>exceptional optimism about our potential.</v>

95
00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.900
<v Speaker 1>So we'll see.</v>

96
00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.420
<v Speaker 1>But I would also say to all of you that are listening,</v>

97
00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

98
00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.680
<v Speaker 1>it is my firm belief that each of us have a responsibility to set the world</v>

99
00:04:40.341 --> 00:04:42.950
<v Speaker 1>right in the manner that we are able to end.</v>

100
00:04:42.951 --> 00:04:46.280
<v Speaker 1>That that is a fundamental,</v>

101
00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.500
<v Speaker 1>that's a fundamental import.</v>

102
00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.570
<v Speaker 1>I really believe in some sense it's of cosmic import in the same way that</v>

103
00:04:53.571 --> 00:04:57.890
<v Speaker 1>consciousness itself is of cosmic import and consciousness reflects being</v>

104
00:04:57.891 --> 00:04:58.724
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

105
00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.313
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

106
00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.320
<v Speaker 1>and I do believe that we have the ability and the responsibility to bring new</v>

107
00:05:06.741 --> 00:05:10.550
<v Speaker 1>creation into being and that our ethical decisions help us</v>

108
00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.610
<v Speaker 1>then our ethical decisions,</v>

109
00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:18.230
<v Speaker 1>that the value of that new being is dependent directly on the ethical decisions</v>

110
00:05:18.231 --> 00:05:19.160
<v Speaker 1>that each of us make.</v>

111
00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.000
<v Speaker 1>And I think we can realize that even though it's a frightening thing to realize,</v>

112
00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:26.360
<v Speaker 1>Marcus Perry asks,</v>

113
00:05:26.361 --> 00:05:27.050
<v Speaker 1>you said,</v>

114
00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.980
<v Speaker 1>the narrow bandwidth of TV has made us think we are stupider than we are.</v>

115
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.900
<v Speaker 1>We'll internet center censorship lead to the same problem once TV is supplanted.</v>

116
00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:37.790
<v Speaker 1>Well God,</v>

117
00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.190
<v Speaker 1>another incredibly complicated question.</v>

118
00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:43.790
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

119
00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.590
<v Speaker 1>whenever I think about censorship,</v>

120
00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.610
<v Speaker 1>I actually talked to mark Zuckerberg a while back and we had a good</v>

121
00:05:49.611 --> 00:05:50.450
<v Speaker 1>conversation,</v>

122
00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:51.021
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

123
00:05:51.021 --> 00:05:56.021
<v Speaker 1>and Zuckerberg who I think is a very straightforward person as far as I could</v>

124
00:05:56.721 --> 00:05:57.554
<v Speaker 1>tell.</v>

125
00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:58.120
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

126
00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.953
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

127
00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:05.010
<v Speaker 1>is optimistic about Facebook and does see it as a platform whose primary goal is</v>

128
00:06:06.461 --> 00:06:09.940
<v Speaker 1>to connect people and mostly at the personal level,</v>

129
00:06:09.941 --> 00:06:14.941
<v Speaker 1>although Dave Facebook has made forays into news provision and that's</v>

130
00:06:15.071 --> 00:06:16.840
<v Speaker 1>complicated their corporate vision.</v>

131
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:21.040
<v Speaker 1>Now I am not a pro censorship character.</v>

132
00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:26.370
<v Speaker 1>I do not like hate speech legislation and I am absolutely opposed to compelled</v>

133
00:06:27.191 --> 00:06:30.190
<v Speaker 1>speech legislation of the sort that's been introduced into Canada.</v>

134
00:06:30.191 --> 00:06:34.810
<v Speaker 1>I think it's violation of the principle of free speech and free thought and I</v>

135
00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:36.610
<v Speaker 1>think it's exceptionally dangerous.</v>

136
00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:38.470
<v Speaker 1>But having said that,</v>

137
00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:39.761
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

138
00:06:39.761 --> 00:06:43.630
<v Speaker 1>nothing is ever simple and that's part of the reason that things are so annoying</v>

139
00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:44.493
<v Speaker 1>politically.</v>

140
00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.150
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

141
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:51.480
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that apple and Facebook and so forth,</v>

142
00:06:51.581 --> 00:06:56.581
<v Speaker 1>those large social media platforms had to contend with say was the attempts by</v>

143
00:06:57.731 --> 00:07:02.731
<v Speaker 1>organizations like isis to use their platforms for recruitment.</v>

144
00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.220
<v Speaker 1>Now let's say that I'm a free speech absolutist,</v>

145
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:11.430
<v Speaker 1>which isn't exactly true because I realized that there are the,</v>

146
00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:16.330
<v Speaker 1>the constraints that he evolved in some sense now truly in the English common</v>

147
00:07:16.331 --> 00:07:19.150
<v Speaker 1>law system on free speech and that they're necessary.</v>

148
00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:20.410
<v Speaker 1>You can't libel someone,</v>

149
00:07:20.411 --> 00:07:21.940
<v Speaker 1>you can't outright lie about someone,</v>

150
00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:22.960
<v Speaker 1>you can't slander them,</v>

151
00:07:22.961 --> 00:07:26.320
<v Speaker 1>you can't counsel them to criminal conduct,</v>

152
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:27.130
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera.</v>

153
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:28.840
<v Speaker 1>There are restrictions on free speech.</v>

154
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:30.723
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

155
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:35.200
<v Speaker 1>but I think those restrictions should be minimal.</v>

156
00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:35.981
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

157
00:07:35.981 --> 00:07:39.880
<v Speaker 1>let's say that one of the restrictions that you assume should be placed on free</v>

158
00:07:39.881 --> 00:07:44.881
<v Speaker 1>speech is that those that you are at war with are not allowed to use your</v>

159
00:07:45.461 --> 00:07:47.320
<v Speaker 1>platform to recruit,</v>

160
00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:51.310
<v Speaker 1>which doesn't seem to be an unreasonable proposition and is perhaps even the</v>

161
00:07:51.311 --> 00:07:54.520
<v Speaker 1>sort of thing and it a conservative or a libertarian,</v>

162
00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:58.840
<v Speaker 1>much less a liberal or a left winger might get behind.</v>

163
00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:04.560
<v Speaker 1>Well then that means that you've defined already a framework in which is that</v>

164
00:08:05.291 --> 00:08:06.430
<v Speaker 1>censorship and,</v>

165
00:08:06.431 --> 00:08:08.350
<v Speaker 1>or maybe I'm not thinking this through clearly,</v>

166
00:08:08.351 --> 00:08:09.910
<v Speaker 1>but is that censorship?</v>

167
00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:11.920
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly self protection.</v>

168
00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:16.840
<v Speaker 1>Well then having established the principle that a certain amount of Mod,</v>

169
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:21.250
<v Speaker 1>what would you call monitoring of the use of your platform is necessary.</v>

170
00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:22.720
<v Speaker 1>Where do you stop?</v>

171
00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:24.220
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is</v>

172
00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:27.090
<v Speaker 1>it's complicated.</v>

173
00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:27.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

174
00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:32.810
<v Speaker 1>I think that what Facebook et Cetera did with Alex Jones was a big mistake.</v>

175
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.100
<v Speaker 1>I think that was because,</v>

176
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:36.090
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

177
00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:38.820
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't just Alex Jones that was punished,</v>

178
00:08:38.821 --> 00:08:41.730
<v Speaker 1>let's say it was all the people that were watching him and not everybody that</v>

179
00:08:41.731 --> 00:08:44.340
<v Speaker 1>was watching him was an avid follower of him.</v>

180
00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:45.753
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

181
00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:50.520
<v Speaker 1>some people were just watching him to see what the hell he was doing and what he</v>

182
00:08:50.521 --> 00:08:52.110
<v Speaker 1>was up to and that's necessary,</v>

183
00:08:52.111 --> 00:08:54.240
<v Speaker 1>but you don't just sensor the one person,</v>

184
00:08:54.241 --> 00:08:57.570
<v Speaker 1>you censor everybody that's paying attention to them and then you make him a</v>

185
00:08:57.571 --> 00:09:01.080
<v Speaker 1>martyr and you persecute someone who's paranoid,</v>

186
00:09:01.081 --> 00:09:05.160
<v Speaker 1>which all that does is validate his conspiracy theories is conspiratorial</v>

187
00:09:05.161 --> 00:09:08.640
<v Speaker 1>theories and the conspiratorial theories of his followers.</v>

188
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:10.283
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

189
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:15.990
<v Speaker 1>I guess one of the things I've really been wondering is if the wild and woolly</v>

190
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:21.590
<v Speaker 1>reality of Facebook and Youtube and Twitter are actually sustainable in a</v>

191
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:29.180
<v Speaker 1>corporate environment or if the radical freedom that was associated with those</v>

192
00:09:29.401 --> 00:09:34.401
<v Speaker 1>technologies was only something that was possible when in some sense all of that</v>

193
00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:36.570
<v Speaker 1>material provision,</v>

194
00:09:36.571 --> 00:09:41.571
<v Speaker 1>all the provision of that material was outside the standard legal framework</v>

195
00:09:42.421 --> 00:09:44.400
<v Speaker 1>because it was too new to regulate.</v>

196
00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:45.241
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

197
00:09:45.241 --> 00:09:46.080
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell.</v>

198
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:50.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if corporations can manage something like youtube or Twitter or</v>

199
00:09:50.521 --> 00:09:51.840
<v Speaker 1>Facebook for that matter,</v>

200
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:57.080
<v Speaker 1>because their internal conservatism and there,</v>

201
00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:58.990
<v Speaker 1>and I mean that in the,</v>

202
00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.390
<v Speaker 1>in the temperamental sense,</v>

203
00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:02.690
<v Speaker 1>their unwillingness to take risk is,</v>

204
00:10:02.691 --> 00:10:02.951
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

205
00:10:02.951 --> 00:10:07.770
<v Speaker 1>is what I mean in that particular case is liable to make it impossible for them</v>

206
00:10:07.771 --> 00:10:10.530
<v Speaker 1>to be neutral purveyors of information,</v>

207
00:10:10.531 --> 00:10:12.570
<v Speaker 1>some of which is going to be extremely radical.</v>

208
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:13.823
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

209
00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:15.751
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

210
00:10:15.751 --> 00:10:17.020
<v Speaker 1>so there's,</v>

211
00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:20.250
<v Speaker 1>I have no conclusions to offer there.</v>

212
00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:21.383
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

213
00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:24.900
<v Speaker 1>and I guess I'm glad in some sense that these complicated,</v>

214
00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:27.660
<v Speaker 1>these particular complicated problems aren't mine to solve.</v>

215
00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:32.280
<v Speaker 1>I certainly think that the production of automated sensors is a very,</v>

216
00:10:32.281 --> 00:10:33.180
<v Speaker 1>very bad idea,</v>

217
00:10:33.181 --> 00:10:37.380
<v Speaker 1>but I'm also someone who's constitutionally opposed to such things as closed</v>

218
00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.020
<v Speaker 1>circuit TV monitor,</v>

219
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:42.030
<v Speaker 1>monitoring of the general public as well.</v>

220
00:10:42.031 --> 00:10:42.600
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

221
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.560
<v Speaker 1>and cameras that,</v>

222
00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:47.550
<v Speaker 1>that watch people at stoplights and any automated system that,</v>

223
00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:52.020
<v Speaker 1>that enforces the law or the,</v>

224
00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.620
<v Speaker 1>or what's hypothetically the law to me is to be regarded with deep,</v>

225
00:10:55.621 --> 00:10:56.670
<v Speaker 1>deep suspicion.</v>

226
00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:58.103
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

227
00:10:58.980 --> 00:10:59.813
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

228
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:00.600
<v Speaker 1>That's that.</v>
