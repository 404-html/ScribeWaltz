1
00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:01.593
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.080
<v Speaker 2>Somebody asked,</v>

3
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.540
<v Speaker 2>what's up with all the lending teachers in your house and then how is it to look</v>

4
00:00:15.541 --> 00:00:16.380
<v Speaker 2>at them every day?</v>

5
00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:19.323
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

6
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:23.503
<v Speaker 3>about</v>

7
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.380
<v Speaker 2>in 2001 you to see it of manic collective insanity.</v>

8
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.400
<v Speaker 2>I decided to start seeing if I could find Soviet era artists ox online,</v>

9
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:37.630
<v Speaker 2>mostly through Ebay.</v>

10
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.820
<v Speaker 2>I had read a paper by James Pennebaker who claimed that uh,</v>

11
00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.860
<v Speaker 2>past events start to become historically significant about 15 years after the,</v>

12
00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:49.870
<v Speaker 2>after the relevant event.</v>

13
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.430
<v Speaker 2>And so 2001 was 15 years after the fall,</v>

14
00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.400
<v Speaker 2>essentially after the fall of the Berlin Wall or close enough.</v>

15
00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.420
<v Speaker 2>And so I started looking on Ebay to see what sort of Soviet artifacts or might</v>

16
00:01:04.121 --> 00:01:04.960
<v Speaker 2>be able to find.</v>

17
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:06.070
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

18
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.611
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

19
00:01:06.611 --> 00:01:10.150
<v Speaker 2>I was kind of curious about what would be available for purchase.</v>

20
00:01:10.151 --> 00:01:14.820
<v Speaker 2>And I also saw it as deeply ironic that the most free market of,</v>

21
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.860
<v Speaker 2>of what would you call platforms ever device,</v>

22
00:01:17.861 --> 00:01:22.861
<v Speaker 2>which would be Ebay could now be used to scavenge communist era artists,</v>

23
00:01:23.681 --> 00:01:24.640
<v Speaker 2>Alex from Russia.</v>

24
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.120
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

25
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.620
<v Speaker 2>it just seemed like to be someone who was raised during the Cold War.</v>

26
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:30.850
<v Speaker 2>The fact that that,</v>

27
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.210
<v Speaker 2>that I could buy things like heads of Lennon on Ebay was just too comical to not</v>

28
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.150
<v Speaker 2>to pass up,</v>

29
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.983
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

30
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.880
<v Speaker 2>And so I started buying things that I had some familiarity with because of what</v>

31
00:01:42.881 --> 00:01:43.830
<v Speaker 2>I'd read historic.</v>

32
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:44.530
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

33
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.480
<v Speaker 2>the first thing I bought was about a three by five silk flag that was awarded to</v>

34
00:01:49.481 --> 00:01:53.500
<v Speaker 2>a factory for meeting its five year production quota.</v>

35
00:01:53.501 --> 00:01:57.360
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know what you know about those infamous quotas,</v>

36
00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.360
<v Speaker 2>but what would happen is that there were dicta sent down on high,</v>

37
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.320
<v Speaker 2>but how much factories were supposed to produce and the implied,</v>

38
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.503
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

39
00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:07.443
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

40
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.760
<v Speaker 2>what the implication was produced or else by any means necessary.</v>

41
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.190
<v Speaker 2>And so two things happened,</v>

42
00:02:15.191 --> 00:02:16.300
<v Speaker 2>three things happened.</v>

43
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.210
<v Speaker 2>The goods were often shoddy because they were rushed.</v>

44
00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.230
<v Speaker 2>There was deception about how much was actually produced and then people were</v>

45
00:02:23.231 --> 00:02:25.350
<v Speaker 2>radically over worked and under supplied.</v>

46
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.060
<v Speaker 2>So it was a bad about and system.</v>

47
00:02:28.061 --> 00:02:31.660
<v Speaker 2>But it was very interesting to actually have one of these flags and see what</v>

48
00:02:31.661 --> 00:02:32.494
<v Speaker 2>they were like.</v>

49
00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.110
<v Speaker 2>And then I bought a block,</v>

50
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.980
<v Speaker 2>a stainless steel plot,</v>

51
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.160
<v Speaker 2>windup clock that was a submarine clock.</v>

52
00:02:39.161 --> 00:02:40.150
<v Speaker 2>And it was bomb proof.</v>

53
00:02:40.151 --> 00:02:44.410
<v Speaker 2>So I thought that would be handy if someone ever bombed my house and I needed to</v>

54
00:02:44.411 --> 00:02:45.520
<v Speaker 2>know what time it was.</v>

55
00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.070
<v Speaker 2>So I bought that.</v>

56
00:02:48.071 --> 00:02:50.820
<v Speaker 2>And then I found this painting that's actually off to my left here.</v>

57
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.490
<v Speaker 2>It's five Russian revolutionaries,</v>

58
00:02:54.491 --> 00:02:56.770
<v Speaker 2>all younger and court stalwart looking,</v>

59
00:02:56.771 --> 00:03:01.771
<v Speaker 2>standing on the edge of a cliff with a red soldier or a white soldier off to</v>

60
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.870
<v Speaker 2>decide they're all shackled together and he's preparing to execute them.</v>

61
00:03:05.871 --> 00:03:06.311
<v Speaker 2>And that was,</v>

62
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:07.144
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

63
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.501
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>

64
00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:09.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

65
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.350
<v Speaker 2>a fairly common Soviet motif.</v>

66
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:12.110
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

67
00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.580
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

68
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.810
<v Speaker 2>on my right side,</v>

69
00:03:13.811 --> 00:03:14.644
<v Speaker 2>I have a,</v>

70
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.550
<v Speaker 2>a decorated Soviet war hero who's,</v>

71
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.930
<v Speaker 2>who's working in a steel foundry and like a lot of the Soviet art glorified,</v>

72
00:03:22.931 --> 00:03:23.764
<v Speaker 2>I suppose the,</v>

73
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:24.850
<v Speaker 2>the working class.</v>

74
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.360
<v Speaker 2>And I suppose there's nothing wrong with that depending on the degree of</v>

75
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.880
<v Speaker 2>propagandistic intent and falsifications.</v>

76
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:31.670
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

77
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:32.503
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

78
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.590
<v Speaker 2>they're kind of like Norman Rockwell paintings,</v>

79
00:03:35.591 --> 00:03:38.320
<v Speaker 2>except they don't have the same degree of sentimentality,</v>

80
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:39.490
<v Speaker 2>which is quite interesting.</v>

81
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.040
<v Speaker 2>And what's it like to have them around?</v>

82
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.903
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

83
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.090
<v Speaker 2>pretty much every square inch of my house is covered with paintings.</v>

84
00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:47.650
<v Speaker 2>And a fair number of them are,</v>

85
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't suppose the sorts of paintings that people would usually have in their</v>

86
00:03:50.951 --> 00:03:51.341
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>

87
00:03:51.341 --> 00:03:51.561
<v Speaker 2>There are,</v>

88
00:03:51.561 --> 00:03:53.440
<v Speaker 2>some of them are of the Second World War.</v>

89
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.000
<v Speaker 2>Some of them are strongly political and uh,</v>

90
00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.943
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

91
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:01.503
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

92
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.600
<v Speaker 2>well sometimes people say,</v>

93
00:04:04.601 --> 00:04:06.890
<v Speaker 2>well I wouldn't want to live in a museum.</v>

94
00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.400
<v Speaker 2>And I guess that isn't how I feel.</v>

95
00:04:09.401 --> 00:04:13.990
<v Speaker 2>I actually like living in a museum and I like having these historical artifacts</v>

96
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.310
<v Speaker 2>around and I really like watching the propaganda and the art more in the,</v>

97
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.890
<v Speaker 2>in the paintings because many of these paintings were produced by very talented</v>

98
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.790
<v Speaker 2>impressionist artists who are trained in the classical European tradition.</v>

99
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.680
<v Speaker 2>They spent months making these paintings and yet their subordinate in some sense</v>

100
00:04:32.681 --> 00:04:34.330
<v Speaker 2>to a political ideology.</v>

101
00:04:34.331 --> 00:04:39.331
<v Speaker 2>But what's interesting is that as the political ideology recedes into the past,</v>

102
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.290
<v Speaker 2>the more purely artistic elements of the painting seem to remain.</v>

103
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.470
<v Speaker 2>And so it's cool to kind of watch,</v>

104
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.640
<v Speaker 2>it's very slow process,</v>

105
00:04:48.641 --> 00:04:50.440
<v Speaker 2>but it's very interesting to watch.</v>

106
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.610
<v Speaker 2>The art itself emerged triumphant over the propaganda.</v>

107
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:56.160
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

108
00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

109
00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.410
<v Speaker 2>these things also remind me of what,</v>

110
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.630
<v Speaker 2>what I'm interested in.</v>

111
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.880
<v Speaker 2>And that's the study of videology.</v>

112
00:05:03.881 --> 00:05:08.740
<v Speaker 2>And they reminded me how powerful ideology can be and how many different</v>

113
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.300
<v Speaker 2>pathways it can take,</v>

114
00:05:10.301 --> 00:05:11.580
<v Speaker 2>two to,</v>

115
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:12.761
<v Speaker 2>to control,</v>

116
00:05:12.761 --> 00:05:13.421
<v Speaker 2>I suppose.</v>

117
00:05:13.421 --> 00:05:13.850
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

118
00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:14.683
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

119
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.000
<v Speaker 2>and it also reminds me of the reality of the 20th century because it was a</v>

120
00:05:19.001 --> 00:05:20.010
<v Speaker 2>terrible reality.</v>

121
00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.030
<v Speaker 2>And if we forget it,</v>

122
00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.500
<v Speaker 2>then we were likely to repeat it.</v>

123
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:25.503
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

124
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.570
<v Speaker 2>my kids grew up in this house and you know,</v>

125
00:05:28.571 --> 00:05:28.930
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

126
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.710
<v Speaker 2>I asked them about it because as far as the paintings are fairly heavy and maybe</v>

127
00:05:32.711 --> 00:05:34.000
<v Speaker 2>even somewhat frightening,</v>

128
00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:37.940
<v Speaker 2>but they really liked it and people that I had,</v>

129
00:05:37.941 --> 00:05:41.710
<v Speaker 2>it gives me a reason to invite people into my house and gives me something to</v>

130
00:05:41.711 --> 00:05:42.280
<v Speaker 2>play with.</v>

131
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:42.710
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

132
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:43.790
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

133
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.190
<v Speaker 2>I guess I need things to play with by all appearances.</v>

134
00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.550
<v Speaker 2>So that's the story of the,</v>

135
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.170
<v Speaker 2>of the Soviet paintings.</v>

136
00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:55.030
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
