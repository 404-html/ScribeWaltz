00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:07.323
<v Speaker 1>Learning theory,</v>

2
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:08.793
<v Speaker 1>behaviorism,</v>

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.910
<v Speaker 1>there are in conditions,</v>

4
00:00:09.911 --> 00:00:10.744
<v Speaker 1>rewards.</v>

5
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.630
<v Speaker 1>Those are rewards you don't have to learn.</v>

6
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.530
<v Speaker 1>Those are the things that bring a motivated state to its closure,</v>

7
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.240
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

8
00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.640
<v Speaker 1>and that makes you satisfied.</v>

9
00:00:21.641 --> 00:00:22.330
<v Speaker 1>Satiation.</v>

10
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.460
<v Speaker 1>That by the way is associated with Serotonin.</v>

11
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.790
<v Speaker 1>Serotonin is a satiating neurochemical,</v>

12
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.490
<v Speaker 1>so if you're hot levels of Serotonin are high,</v>

13
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:31.660
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of satisfied,</v>

14
00:00:31.661 --> 00:00:35.380
<v Speaker 1>which means you don't experience a lot of positive emotion or a lot of negative</v>

15
00:00:35.381 --> 00:00:35.681
<v Speaker 1>emotion.</v>

16
00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:36.940
<v Speaker 1>You're just kind of satisfied.</v>

17
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.500
<v Speaker 1>It's a high dominance thing.</v>

18
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.100
<v Speaker 1>It's like all the consumer story rewards are there when you need them.</v>

19
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.920
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to worry and you don't have to get too excited.</v>

20
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.250
<v Speaker 1>Conditioned rewards or incentive rewards indicate progress towards a consumer to</v>

21
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.390
<v Speaker 1>consumer Tory reward.</v>

22
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.250
<v Speaker 1>They can be learned or condition,</v>

23
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.940
<v Speaker 1>but they can also be a Nate and their associated with dopaminergic activation</v>

24
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.390
<v Speaker 1>and that's the exploration circuit that comes out of the hypothalamus.</v>

25
00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.900
<v Speaker 1>Half the hypothalamus does goal specification.</v>

26
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.600
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

27
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.160
<v Speaker 1>and the other half does exploration.</v>

28
00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:09.660
<v Speaker 1>And so again,</v>

29
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.040
<v Speaker 1>if you're pursuing something that's an identifiable goal and you fail,</v>

30
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.890
<v Speaker 1>well then you're going to back off.</v>

31
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.880
<v Speaker 1>That's negative emotion.</v>

32
00:01:17.881 --> 00:01:21.300
<v Speaker 1>Then you're going to start to explore and that's that dopaminergic circuit.</v>

33
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.700
<v Speaker 1>What's associated with dopaminergic activation,</v>

34
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.121
<v Speaker 1>exploration,</v>

35
00:01:29.121 --> 00:01:29.751
<v Speaker 1>extroversion,</v>

36
00:01:29.751 --> 00:01:30.381
<v Speaker 1>happiness,</v>

37
00:01:30.381 --> 00:01:31.040
<v Speaker 1>play,</v>

38
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.970
<v Speaker 1>enthusiasm,</v>

39
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.760
<v Speaker 1>assertiveness and the positive element of novelty.</v>

40
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.631
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

41
00:01:35.631 --> 00:01:36.770
<v Speaker 1>so that makes sense.</v>

42
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.300
<v Speaker 1>Anybody have any questions?</v>

43
00:01:38.301 --> 00:01:42.290
<v Speaker 1>I know that's a lot of information but I kind of designed this part of the</v>

44
00:01:42.291 --> 00:01:46.370
<v Speaker 1>course so that at this point the levels of analysis would stack up so that you</v>

45
00:01:46.371 --> 00:01:48.170
<v Speaker 1>could understand them simultaneously.</v>

46
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.720
<v Speaker 1>So the hypothalamus sets up your frames of motivation</v>

47
00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.760
<v Speaker 1>running one of those to the co two.</v>

48
00:01:58.761 --> 00:02:00.220
<v Speaker 1>It's positive conclusion.</v>

49
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.240
<v Speaker 1>That satisfying.</v>

50
00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.070
<v Speaker 1>That's innate.</v>

51
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.110
<v Speaker 1>It's because it's conservatory reward.</v>

52
00:02:05.111 --> 00:02:05.950
<v Speaker 1>You'll work for that.</v>

53
00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.800
<v Speaker 1>Anything that indicates that that might happen,</v>

54
00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.690
<v Speaker 1>that's incentive reward.</v>

55
00:02:10.691 --> 00:02:11.411
<v Speaker 1>You can learn that.</v>

56
00:02:11.411 --> 00:02:12.850
<v Speaker 1>But some of it's also a Nate,</v>

57
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.660
<v Speaker 1>which is where the behaviors didn't know that cause they thought of all the,</v>

58
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.540
<v Speaker 1>all the secondary stuff that condition stuff has learned.</v>

59
00:02:19.541 --> 00:02:20.470
<v Speaker 1>Its not all learned.</v>

60
00:02:20.471 --> 00:02:21.640
<v Speaker 1>Some of it's already prepared.</v>

61
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:22.900
<v Speaker 1>You see a snake,</v>

62
00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:23.680
<v Speaker 1>that's a threat.</v>

63
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.730
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to learn that.</v>

64
00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.090
<v Speaker 1>So fires sort of like that as well.</v>

65
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

66
00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:29.950
<v Speaker 1>blood is like that.</v>

67
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.270
<v Speaker 1>Teeth are like that.</v>

68
00:02:31.271 --> 00:02:32.740
<v Speaker 1>Staring eyes are like that.</v>

69
00:02:32.741 --> 00:02:34.780
<v Speaker 1>Predatory postures are like that.</v>

70
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.153
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

71
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.923
<v Speaker 1>loud,</v>

72
00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.550
<v Speaker 1>loud vocalizations,</v>

73
00:02:39.551 --> 00:02:41.860
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're like low,</v>

74
00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.020
<v Speaker 1>low in frequency,</v>

75
00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.700
<v Speaker 1>they indicate a large animal.</v>

76
00:02:45.701 --> 00:02:48.730
<v Speaker 1>All those things are things you don't have to learn to be afraid of because</v>

77
00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.690
<v Speaker 1>they've been so consistently dangerous in the past that you've built up a</v>

78
00:02:52.691 --> 00:02:55.390
<v Speaker 1>circuit that aren't responds automatically to the question.</v>

79
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.110
<v Speaker 3>It seems like there will,</v>

80
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.560
<v Speaker 3>at least in the example that he did,</v>

81
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.550
<v Speaker 3>but I'm kind of mutually eggs</v>

82
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.140
<v Speaker 3>or did you know what I mean?</v>

83
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.551
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

84
00:03:08.551 --> 00:03:09.390
<v Speaker 1>it's complicated,</v>

85
00:03:09.391 --> 00:03:09.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

86
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.270
<v Speaker 1>because they do play a bit of an inhibitory role,</v>

87
00:03:12.271 --> 00:03:13.620
<v Speaker 1>but they're separate circuits,</v>

88
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.611
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

89
00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:17.970
<v Speaker 1>so you can be very extroverted and very high in negative emotion.</v>

90
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.610
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

91
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:19.443
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

92
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.870
<v Speaker 1>and you can be very emotionally stable and very low in extroversion too.</v>

93
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.561
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

94
00:03:25.561 --> 00:03:27.810
<v Speaker 1>but they are definitely separate things now.</v>

95
00:03:27.811 --> 00:03:28.350
<v Speaker 1>It's hard,</v>

96
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

97
00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.470
<v Speaker 1>you can flip from laughing to crying very rapidly,</v>

98
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.431
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

99
00:03:32.431 --> 00:03:36.420
<v Speaker 1>So people are very much capable of experiencing mixed states of positive and</v>

100
00:03:36.421 --> 00:03:37.254
<v Speaker 1>negative emotion.</v>

101
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.980
<v Speaker 1>Plus there are forms of manic depressive disorder where people are manic and</v>

102
00:03:40.981 --> 00:03:42.420
<v Speaker 1>depressed at the same time,</v>

103
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.750
<v Speaker 1>which I would recommend the people I know that have had that,</v>

104
00:03:45.751 --> 00:03:47.970
<v Speaker 1>they seem to think that is certainly not fun.</v>

105
00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.373
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

106
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:52.703
<v Speaker 1>agitation,</v>

107
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.990
<v Speaker 1>tremendous agitation.</v>

108
00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.770
<v Speaker 1>So you're probably sort of like that when you're deeply confused and you're</v>

109
00:03:58.771 --> 00:03:59.970
<v Speaker 1>really bothered by it,</v>

110
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:01.800
<v Speaker 1>cause then the thread circuits are going,</v>

111
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.660
<v Speaker 1>but you're also sort of wandering around going,</v>

112
00:04:03.661 --> 00:04:03.841
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

113
00:04:03.841 --> 00:04:04.800
<v Speaker 1>what am I going to do?</v>

114
00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.843
<v Speaker 1>That's all.</v>

115
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.120
<v Speaker 1>That's all like approach behavior approach.</v>

116
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.130
<v Speaker 1>Motivation isn't always positive a,</v>

117
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean most of the time it is,</v>

118
00:04:12.421 --> 00:04:16.140
<v Speaker 1>but intensity measures and controllability matters too,</v>

119
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.393
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

120
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:18.653
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

121
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.420
<v Speaker 1>Unconditioned punishments,</v>

122
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.910
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally they produce pain.</v>

123
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.120
<v Speaker 1>They also tend to Ha if you run a behavioral routine or a motivated framework</v>

124
00:04:32.251 --> 00:04:33.510
<v Speaker 1>that results in punishment,</v>

125
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.240
<v Speaker 1>you're less likely to run it again in the future.</v>

126
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.193
<v Speaker 1>That's learning.</v>

127
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.900
<v Speaker 1>If you run a motivated frame and it works,</v>

128
00:04:39.901 --> 00:04:41.460
<v Speaker 1>you're more likely to run it in the future.</v>

129
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:42.840
<v Speaker 1>That's learning too,</v>

130
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.530
<v Speaker 1>so I'm conditioned.</v>

131
00:04:46.531 --> 00:04:49.290
<v Speaker 1>Punishments decreased the probability that you're going to run to given</v>

132
00:04:49.291 --> 00:04:51.600
<v Speaker 1>motivational frame because it failed.</v>

133
00:04:51.601 --> 00:04:51.841
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

134
00:04:51.841 --> 00:04:52.080
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

135
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.580
<v Speaker 1>you ran out and you got hurt.</v>

136
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:54.960
<v Speaker 1>It's like don't do that again.</v>

137
00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.380
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the purpose of memory and the pain,</v>

138
00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:00.150
<v Speaker 1>like emotions just to say it again.</v>

139
00:05:00.151 --> 00:05:00.984
<v Speaker 1>Our pain,</v>

140
00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:02.280
<v Speaker 1>frustration,</v>

141
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.143
<v Speaker 1>disappointment,</v>

142
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:04.140
<v Speaker 1>grief,</v>

143
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.850
<v Speaker 1>sadness is in there as well.</v>

144
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.040
<v Speaker 1>So those are paying like states of emotion,</v>

145
00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.470
<v Speaker 1>conditioned punishments.</v>

146
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.100
<v Speaker 1>Those are things that indicate that a punishment is likely.</v>

147
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.230
<v Speaker 1>Some of them you can learn.</v>

148
00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.850
<v Speaker 1>Some of them you don't have to because they're already built into the negative.</v>

149
00:05:20.851 --> 00:05:23.040
<v Speaker 1>Emotions are dampened by Serotonin.</v>

150
00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.470
<v Speaker 1>That's the fundamental brain system.</v>

151
00:05:25.471 --> 00:05:26.290
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally,</v>

152
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.130
<v Speaker 1>it's the serotonergic system is like a conductor of the orchestra.</v>

153
00:05:29.131 --> 00:05:30.300
<v Speaker 1>It keeps everything in,</v>

154
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.910
<v Speaker 1>in balance and Gaba.</v>

155
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.000
<v Speaker 1>Gaba is a anxiety or lytic,</v>

156
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:37.350
<v Speaker 1>it makes people less anxious.</v>

157
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:38.243
<v Speaker 1>It's indogenous.</v>

158
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.240
<v Speaker 1>Your brain produces it.</v>

159
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.690
<v Speaker 1>If you take Valium or barbiturates,</v>

160
00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.580
<v Speaker 1>they act on the Gaba system.</v>

161
00:05:44.581 --> 00:05:45.600
<v Speaker 1>It's so does alcohol.</v>

162
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.380
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the reason why people like alcohol because it dampens anxiety.</v>

163
00:05:49.381 --> 00:05:50.280
<v Speaker 1>Now for some people,</v>

164
00:05:50.281 --> 00:05:53.460
<v Speaker 1>alcohol or also produces dopaminergic activation,</v>

165
00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 1>so they really like alcohol because it calms them down like they're not anxious</v>

166
00:05:58.221 --> 00:06:03.221
<v Speaker 1>anymore and it also feels it produces incentive reward activation like cocaine.</v>

167
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:05.030
<v Speaker 1>So for some people,</v>

168
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.010
<v Speaker 1>alcohol is and absolutely deadly drug.</v>

169
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.930
<v Speaker 1>You can probably find out if you're susceptible to alcoholism quite</v>

170
00:06:11.931 --> 00:06:12.860
<v Speaker 1>straightforwardly.</v>

171
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:14.930
<v Speaker 1>If you want to find out,</v>

172
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.640
<v Speaker 1>sit in a bar,</v>

173
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.840
<v Speaker 1>take your pulse</v>

174
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:20.031
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>

175
00:06:20.031 --> 00:06:21.080
<v Speaker 1>five shots,</v>

176
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:23.211
<v Speaker 1>four shots.</v>

177
00:06:23.211 --> 00:06:24.044
<v Speaker 1>If you're little,</v>

178
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:25.281
<v Speaker 1>you got to get your,</v>

179
00:06:25.281 --> 00:06:28.730
<v Speaker 1>you got to get your blood alcohol level above legal intoxication or you won't be</v>

180
00:06:28.731 --> 00:06:32.420
<v Speaker 1>able to tell and then take your pulse again 10 minutes later if your pulse has</v>

181
00:06:32.421 --> 00:06:33.254
<v Speaker 1>gone up,</v>

182
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:34.850
<v Speaker 1>eight beats are more,</v>

183
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.440
<v Speaker 1>watch it because you're probably producing an opiate response to alcohol.</v>

184
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.190
<v Speaker 1>Secondary consequences of the opiate responses is a dopaminergic response.</v>

185
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.060
<v Speaker 1>Reasonable probability that you'll like alcohol enough to find it.</v>

186
00:06:47.061 --> 00:06:48.500
<v Speaker 1>Difficult to stop drinking.</v>

187
00:06:48.501 --> 00:06:49.340
<v Speaker 1>Once you start.</v>

188
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:50.660
<v Speaker 1>Some of you are probably like that,</v>

189
00:06:50.661 --> 00:06:50.871
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

190
00:06:50.871 --> 00:06:51.561
<v Speaker 1>You have a few drinks.</v>

191
00:06:51.561 --> 00:06:52.880
<v Speaker 1>It's like he ha,</v>

192
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:55.730
<v Speaker 1>that's how we do it in Alberta anyways,</v>

193
00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:56.923
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

194
00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.700
<v Speaker 1>so part of that killing the incentive reward system and because it's an approach</v>

195
00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:04.490
<v Speaker 1>system and it's being cued by the alcohol,</v>

196
00:07:04.491 --> 00:07:09.491
<v Speaker 1>you just continue to hit it and the dopamine kicks only occur as your blood</v>

197
00:07:10.671 --> 00:07:12.200
<v Speaker 1>alcohol level is rising.</v>

198
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.420
<v Speaker 1>So you have to keep nailing it,</v>

199
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.720
<v Speaker 1>nailing yourself with alcohol because otherwise your blood alcohol level won't</v>

200
00:07:17.721 --> 00:07:22.070
<v Speaker 1>keep rising and you won't get that nice enthusiasm and assertiveness that goes</v>

201
00:07:22.071 --> 00:07:23.420
<v Speaker 1>along with the pause.</v>

202
00:07:23.421 --> 00:07:25.220
<v Speaker 1>Development of alcohol,</v>

203
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:27.831
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism.</v>

204
00:07:27.831 --> 00:07:29.750
<v Speaker 1>So this is the neuroticism dimension.</v>

205
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:31.063
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

206
00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:34.070
<v Speaker 1>there's this gender difference in neuroticism.</v>

207
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.890
<v Speaker 1>Women are about half a standard deviation,</v>

208
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:38.900
<v Speaker 1>higher negative emotion than men.</v>

209
00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:42.110
<v Speaker 1>It's seems like a cross cultural universal,</v>

210
00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:44.000
<v Speaker 1>the differences more enhanced.</v>

211
00:07:44.001 --> 00:07:46.400
<v Speaker 1>And he galitary in states like Scandinavia,</v>

212
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:49.280
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly the opposite of what you'd presume,</v>

213
00:07:49.281 --> 00:07:49.461
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

214
00:07:49.461 --> 00:07:50.120
<v Speaker 1>If you were,</v>

215
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:50.953
<v Speaker 1>say us,</v>

216
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:51.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

217
00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:52.800
<v Speaker 1>a radical,</v>

218
00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:55.970
<v Speaker 1>can't remember the name.</v>

219
00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.910
<v Speaker 1>If you are someone who believes that everything occurs as a consequence of</v>

220
00:07:58.911 --> 00:07:59.840
<v Speaker 1>socialization,</v>

221
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:02.120
<v Speaker 1>as you equalize the society,</v>

222
00:08:02.121 --> 00:08:05.660
<v Speaker 1>the gender differences in personality become larger rather than smaller.</v>

223
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:06.620
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

224
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:06.981
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

225
00:08:06.981 --> 00:08:07.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

226
00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.780
<v Speaker 1>not what anybody expected.</v>

227
00:08:08.781 --> 00:08:09.680
<v Speaker 1>But that's what happened.</v>

228
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:14.060
<v Speaker 1>So boys and girls seem to have about the same level of negative emotion.</v>

229
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:15.530
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as puberty hits,</v>

230
00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.830
<v Speaker 1>women become higher negative emotion than men on average.</v>

231
00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:23.000
<v Speaker 1>There's still a lot of overlap between the genders and it never goes away again</v>

232
00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:24.500
<v Speaker 1>across the life course.</v>

233
00:08:24.501 --> 00:08:25.760
<v Speaker 1>Once it kicks in in puberty,</v>

234
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:27.050
<v Speaker 1>and the reasons for that,</v>

235
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.760
<v Speaker 1>women are smaller,</v>

236
00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:29.210
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

237
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:30.710
<v Speaker 1>their upper bodies are weaker,</v>

238
00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:31.910
<v Speaker 1>so they're more physical.</v>

239
00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:33.920
<v Speaker 1>They're there at a physical disadvantage.</v>

240
00:08:33.921 --> 00:08:35.420
<v Speaker 1>If they're in a dominance dispute,</v>

241
00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.100
<v Speaker 1>they're sexually vulnerable,</v>

242
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.140
<v Speaker 1>plus they have to take care of infants.</v>

243
00:08:39.141 --> 00:08:43.700
<v Speaker 1>So I think those four things are probably enough to tilt the nervous system of</v>

244
00:08:43.701 --> 00:08:46.700
<v Speaker 1>women more towards negative negative emotion.</v>

245
00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:50.300
<v Speaker 1>I've often thought maybe that women's Nate emotional systems,</v>

246
00:08:50.301 --> 00:08:54.080
<v Speaker 1>the negative ones in particular are actually not tuned to the woman.</v>

247
00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.570
<v Speaker 1>I think there are tuned to the woman incent combination.</v>

248
00:08:58.350 --> 00:08:59.350
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

249
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.960
<v Speaker 1>if you think about it from an,</v>

250
00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.330
<v Speaker 1>if you think about it for bait,</v>

251
00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:07.110
<v Speaker 1>it almost has to be that way because an infant has to be carried around for like</v>

252
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:07.470
<v Speaker 1>a year and a half.</v>

253
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:12.210
<v Speaker 1>And so at that point when you have an incident and maybe you're going to have 10</v>

254
00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:13.470
<v Speaker 1>you know you guys won't,</v>

255
00:09:13.471 --> 00:09:14.770
<v Speaker 1>but in the evolutionary paths,</v>

256
00:09:14.771 --> 00:09:15.630
<v Speaker 1>that would have been the case.</v>

257
00:09:15.631 --> 00:09:16.780
<v Speaker 1>You'd have an infant for a much,</v>

258
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:19.680
<v Speaker 1>much of your life and then you'd be a grandmother and have an incident.</v>

259
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:20.963
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

260
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:25.350
<v Speaker 1>why wouldn't your nervous system be tuned at puberty for the two of you instead</v>

261
00:09:25.351 --> 00:09:26.184
<v Speaker 1>of one of you?</v>

262
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.130
<v Speaker 1>So how could it be any other way?</v>

263
00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:30.353
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

264
00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:35.430
<v Speaker 1>so you've got your hypothalamus and then on top of that you've got some circuits</v>

265
00:09:35.431 --> 00:09:36.810
<v Speaker 1>that deal with memory and emotion.</v>

266
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.840
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to run you through the hippocampus and the Amygdala relatively</v>

267
00:09:39.841 --> 00:09:40.590
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>

268
00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:44.700
<v Speaker 1>So this is a theory that was basically put together by Sokolov who was a Russian</v>

269
00:09:44.701 --> 00:09:48.720
<v Speaker 1>neuropsychologist back in 1962 but it's a variant of a theory that Norbert</v>

270
00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.540
<v Speaker 1>Wiener developed back in the forties so here's the idea.</v>

271
00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:54.720
<v Speaker 1>You wander through the world and you,</v>

272
00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:56.880
<v Speaker 1>if you're in a place that you know,</v>

273
00:09:58.490 --> 00:09:59.323
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

274
00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:00.630
<v Speaker 1>your memory systems,</v>

275
00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:02.560
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

276
00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:07.560
<v Speaker 1>the HIPPA campus looks inside your memory systems to see what it is that you</v>

277
00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:11.470
<v Speaker 1>want to have happen based on your understanding of the world.</v>

278
00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:12.790
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

279
00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:15.770
<v Speaker 1>So you're in a motivated state,</v>

280
00:10:15.771 --> 00:10:19.280
<v Speaker 1>but you have certain expectations that makes sense within that state.</v>

281
00:10:19.281 --> 00:10:22.520
<v Speaker 1>So the hippocampus is watching what you think is going to happen.</v>

282
00:10:22.521 --> 00:10:24.050
<v Speaker 1>But remember that's motivated.</v>

283
00:10:24.051 --> 00:10:25.310
<v Speaker 1>It's not just the expectation.</v>

284
00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:29.150
<v Speaker 1>And then the hippocampus is also looking at the world.</v>

285
00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:36.650
<v Speaker 1>Now it's looking at it interpretation of the world because you can't help but</v>

286
00:10:36.661 --> 00:10:37.500
<v Speaker 1>interpret the world.</v>

287
00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:41.190
<v Speaker 1>But fundamentally the hippocampus is looking inside you and outside you.</v>

288
00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:46.290
<v Speaker 1>And then it seeing if what's happening inside and what's happening outside are</v>

289
00:10:46.291 --> 00:10:47.124
<v Speaker 1>the same,</v>

290
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:51.150
<v Speaker 1>which means you know what you're doing and you know where you are.</v>

291
00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:52.590
<v Speaker 1>And if they're the same.</v>

292
00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:53.910
<v Speaker 1>So if it detects a match,</v>

293
00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:55.530
<v Speaker 1>then the hippocampus,</v>

294
00:10:55.531 --> 00:10:59.610
<v Speaker 1>the inhibits the Amygdala and the hypothalamus,</v>

295
00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:00.391
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>

296
00:11:00.391 --> 00:11:01.860
<v Speaker 1>Now what it actually seems to do,</v>

297
00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:05.310
<v Speaker 1>there's a little circuit in your brain stem called the reticular activating</v>

298
00:11:05.311 --> 00:11:05.970
<v Speaker 1>circuit.</v>

299
00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:07.860
<v Speaker 1>And it's the thing that turns your brain on at night.</v>

300
00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:10.470
<v Speaker 1>If you're sleeping and you hear a noise that you shouldn't hear,</v>

301
00:11:10.471 --> 00:11:11.191
<v Speaker 1>it's like bang,</v>

302
00:11:11.191 --> 00:11:12.000
<v Speaker 1>you're awake.</v>

303
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.470
<v Speaker 1>It's the reticular activating system.</v>

304
00:11:13.471 --> 00:11:14.670
<v Speaker 1>Way Down in your brainstem,</v>

305
00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:19.350
<v Speaker 1>puts your cortex into a high arousal state and Poof,</v>

306
00:11:19.351 --> 00:11:20.184
<v Speaker 1>you're conscious.</v>

307
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:25.550
<v Speaker 1>Now the hippocampus tells the reticular activating system to basically remain</v>

308
00:11:26.011 --> 00:11:27.420
<v Speaker 1>calm as well as,</v>

309
00:11:27.421 --> 00:11:32.421
<v Speaker 1>as long as what you're expecting and desiring and what's happening are the same</v>

310
00:11:33.211 --> 00:11:33.750
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

311
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:35.130
<v Speaker 1>So it's sort of like it's saying,</v>

312
00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.880
<v Speaker 1>I know you could jump up and freak out and run about,</v>

313
00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:41.100
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have to right now because everything's going according to plan.</v>

314
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:44.520
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as there's a deviation that's an normally say,</v>

315
00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:45.870
<v Speaker 1>then the hippocampus says,</v>

316
00:11:45.871 --> 00:11:46.704
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

317
00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:48.270
<v Speaker 1>something's wrong here.</v>

318
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:49.350
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

319
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:53.470
<v Speaker 1>it does inhibits their reticular activating system that turns on your emotions,</v>

320
00:11:53.471 --> 00:11:54.640
<v Speaker 1>especially your negative emotion,</v>

321
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:58.420
<v Speaker 1>but it primes your positive emotion and it primes some of the hypothalamic</v>

322
00:11:58.421 --> 00:11:59.860
<v Speaker 1>circuits to or disinhibiting them.</v>

323
00:11:59.861 --> 00:12:04.660
<v Speaker 1>Because one way of solving the fact that something isn't going well is to switch</v>

324
00:12:04.661 --> 00:12:05.710
<v Speaker 1>to something else.</v>

325
00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:09.760
<v Speaker 1>So it's sort of like there's a bunch of circuits on underneath you,</v>

326
00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:15.090
<v Speaker 1>but they're being held back like race horses in race horse and then something</v>

327
00:12:15.431 --> 00:12:16.600
<v Speaker 1>that you don't expect happens.</v>

328
00:12:16.601 --> 00:12:19.720
<v Speaker 1>And the gates come up a little bit because then you're prepared.</v>

329
00:12:19.721 --> 00:12:21.190
<v Speaker 1>Now a lot of that's negative emotion.</v>

330
00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:21.611
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

331
00:12:21.611 --> 00:12:22.600
<v Speaker 1>you don't know where you are.</v>

332
00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:23.670
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of,</v>

333
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:26.770
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the rest of it is be prepared to do whatever the hell you might need to</v>

334
00:12:26.771 --> 00:12:27.604
<v Speaker 1>do next.</v>

335
00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:31.640
<v Speaker 1>And so what normally the hippocampus detects a,</v>

336
00:12:31.641 --> 00:12:35.440
<v Speaker 1>normally that's something unexpected and then it does inhibits your lower</v>

337
00:12:35.441 --> 00:12:37.390
<v Speaker 1>circuitry and it gets you ready to go.</v>

338
00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.490
<v Speaker 1>Now the problem is,</v>

339
00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:41.170
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

340
00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:44.140
<v Speaker 1>how worried should you be when something that you don't expect happens?</v>

341
00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:45.560
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

342
00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.420
<v Speaker 1>An answer to that is you don't know.</v>

343
00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:51.380
<v Speaker 1>That's a big problem with life because now something went wrong.</v>

344
00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:52.760
<v Speaker 1>Here's the possibilities.</v>

345
00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:54.410
<v Speaker 1>You're not looking at the world,</v>

346
00:12:54.411 --> 00:12:55.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

347
00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.750
<v Speaker 1>So it's actually a perceptual problem,</v>

348
00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:57.763
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

349
00:12:58.170 --> 00:12:59.720
<v Speaker 1>Like gray for example,</v>

350
00:12:59.721 --> 00:13:01.940
<v Speaker 1>believes that you just see the world just like it is.</v>

351
00:13:01.941 --> 00:13:03.140
<v Speaker 1>Cause he's sort of a behaviorist.</v>

352
00:13:03.141 --> 00:13:04.190
<v Speaker 1>It's full of stimuli.</v>

353
00:13:04.191 --> 00:13:05.210
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to interpret them.</v>

354
00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:06.081
<v Speaker 1>That's wrong.</v>

355
00:13:06.081 --> 00:13:07.010
<v Speaker 1>You have to interpret them.</v>

356
00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:08.360
<v Speaker 1>So if something goes wrong,</v>

357
00:13:08.361 --> 00:13:10.340
<v Speaker 1>it might be that you're looking at things wrong,</v>

358
00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:12.380
<v Speaker 1>your perceptual systems are out.</v>

359
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:13.101
<v Speaker 1>It's unlikely.</v>

360
00:13:13.101 --> 00:13:14.570
<v Speaker 1>But sometimes that's the case.</v>

361
00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:16.461
<v Speaker 1>But forget that.</v>

362
00:13:16.461 --> 00:13:19.940
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that you're looking at the world correctly and you know your</v>

363
00:13:19.941 --> 00:13:21.650
<v Speaker 1>inferences about what went wrong,</v>

364
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:26.960
<v Speaker 1>what went wrong isn't the consequence of you misperceiving it's a consequence of</v>

365
00:13:26.961 --> 00:13:30.200
<v Speaker 1>some stupid problem with your stupid plan.</v>

366
00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.440
<v Speaker 1>The problem is you don't know where the error is located.</v>

367
00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:37.670
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I think there's temperament.</v>

368
00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:41.450
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes if something unexpected happens,</v>

369
00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:43.190
<v Speaker 1>you should really freak out.</v>

370
00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:45.140
<v Speaker 1>Other times you should ignore it,</v>

371
00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:48.020
<v Speaker 1>but you can't tell which of those is true right away.</v>

372
00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:51.560
<v Speaker 1>So what happens is there's a distribution with a little thing happens.</v>

373
00:13:51.561 --> 00:13:55.430
<v Speaker 1>Some people really get upset about it and other people hardly care at all.</v>

374
00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:58.280
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes the people who get really upset about it or write,</v>

375
00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:00.800
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes the people who don't care at all are right.</v>

376
00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:03.320
<v Speaker 1>And that's why there's variability in neuroticism,</v>

377
00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:05.091
<v Speaker 1>okay?</v>

378
00:14:05.091 --> 00:14:09.500
<v Speaker 1>Now what you do when you're exploring is you start to decompose your plan,</v>

379
00:14:09.501 --> 00:14:09.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

380
00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:10.131
<v Speaker 1>If you're,</v>

381
00:14:10.131 --> 00:14:10.491
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

382
00:14:10.491 --> 00:14:11.360
<v Speaker 1>if you can manage it,</v>

383
00:14:11.361 --> 00:14:11.781
<v Speaker 1>if you're not,</v>

384
00:14:11.781 --> 00:14:14.720
<v Speaker 1>so like grip my anxiety that you're paralyzed.</v>

385
00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:16.490
<v Speaker 1>Then you go into your plan and you think,</v>

386
00:14:16.491 --> 00:14:16.940
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

387
00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:20.810
<v Speaker 1>am I a complete like loser or is it some micro thing that's gone wrong?</v>

388
00:14:20.811 --> 00:14:23.600
<v Speaker 1>And then you can start to decompose it and reconstruct your plat.</v>

389
00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:24.650
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

390
00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:25.483
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

391
00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:27.230
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

392
00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:28.063
<v Speaker 1>the other,</v>

393
00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:31.760
<v Speaker 1>the other thing that this little diagram helps you understand.</v>

394
00:14:31.761 --> 00:14:32.091
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

395
00:14:32.091 --> 00:14:32.331
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

396
00:14:32.331 --> 00:14:35.190
<v Speaker 1>what happens is when you're laying out a plan,</v>

397
00:14:35.191 --> 00:14:36.110
<v Speaker 1>a motivated plan,</v>

398
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:37.610
<v Speaker 1>and a hole appears in it,</v>

399
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.680
<v Speaker 1>you have to figure out why you fell in the hole.</v>

400
00:14:39.681 --> 00:14:43.040
<v Speaker 1>And then what you have to do is you have to take that motivated plan that's kind</v>

401
00:14:43.041 --> 00:14:46.490
<v Speaker 1>of running on automatic and you have to remember what it's made out of.</v>

402
00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:48.990
<v Speaker 1>And so what opens up underneath you when,</v>

403
00:14:48.991 --> 00:14:51.350
<v Speaker 1>when you've made a mistake is the complexity,</v>

404
00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:52.363
<v Speaker 1>the plant,</v>

405
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:56.180
<v Speaker 1>and then also potentially the complexity of the world on the off chance that</v>

406
00:14:56.181 --> 00:14:57.260
<v Speaker 1>you've misperceived it,</v>

407
00:14:57.261 --> 00:14:57.471
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

408
00:14:57.471 --> 00:14:58.010
<v Speaker 1>You're just,</v>

409
00:14:58.010 --> 00:14:58.843
<v Speaker 1>someone might say,</v>

410
00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:00.860
<v Speaker 1>you're not understanding me properly.</v>

411
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:01.641
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

412
00:15:01.641 --> 00:15:04.310
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's something wrong with you that's interfering with the perception</v>

413
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:07.830
<v Speaker 1>and then you have to do this massive search to try to figure out where their</v>

414
00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:08.713
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>

415
00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:09.673
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

416
00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:13.670
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason I believe that people stick to their beliefs so hard is</v>

417
00:15:13.671 --> 00:15:17.450
<v Speaker 1>because people don't like it when the hole appears in one of their big</v>

418
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:18.650
<v Speaker 1>abstractions,</v>

419
00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:19.281
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

420
00:15:19.281 --> 00:15:23.060
<v Speaker 1>So they've got these high order representations of the world that are shorthand,</v>

421
00:15:23.061 --> 00:15:24.440
<v Speaker 1>ways of representing something.</v>

422
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:26.360
<v Speaker 1>They're sort of like axioms of faith.</v>

423
00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:27.733
<v Speaker 1>And if they,</v>

424
00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:30.200
<v Speaker 1>if a hole appears in one of the axioms of faith,</v>

425
00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:34.010
<v Speaker 1>then all this complexity comes rushing up and it's overwhelming.</v>

426
00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:39.100
<v Speaker 1>And so people hate it when you undermine one of their high order abstractions.</v>

427
00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:41.660
<v Speaker 1>And so I think I told you this before,</v>

428
00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.460
<v Speaker 1>don't do that in relationships,</v>

429
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:43.881
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

430
00:15:43.881 --> 00:15:45.800
<v Speaker 1>It's best not to do it to yourself as well.</v>

431
00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:47.630
<v Speaker 1>I'll start with this.</v>

432
00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.130
<v Speaker 1>These are Medusa's.</v>

433
00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:52.280
<v Speaker 1>And what happens when you see the Medusa?</v>

434
00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:54.071
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

435
00:15:54.071 --> 00:15:54.480
<v Speaker 1>so what,</v>

436
00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.550
<v Speaker 1>what might that mean?</v>

437
00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:59.313
<v Speaker 1>You bet it's the,</v>

438
00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:00.460
<v Speaker 1>it's a prey response.</v>

439
00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:02.440
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a sort of,</v>

440
00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:05.080
<v Speaker 1>that's the sort of thing that occurs when</v>

441
00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:10.900
<v Speaker 1>you're moving towards your goal in your frame and the bottom drops out.</v>

442
00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:11.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

443
00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:11.561
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

444
00:16:11.561 --> 00:16:12.394
<v Speaker 1>what's there?</v>

445
00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:14.763
<v Speaker 1>You don't know.</v>

446
00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:16.960
<v Speaker 1>So what's the logical first response?</v>

447
00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:17.501
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

448
00:16:17.501 --> 00:16:18.460
<v Speaker 1>if you're high in neuroticism,</v>

449
00:16:18.461 --> 00:16:20.200
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be this in a freeze.</v>

450
00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:21.633
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

451
00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:22.810
<v Speaker 1>and only then,</v>

452
00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:24.850
<v Speaker 1>if nothing else terrible happens to you,</v>

453
00:16:24.851 --> 00:16:26.440
<v Speaker 1>you'll start to relax a bit.</v>

454
00:16:26.441 --> 00:16:29.160
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe you'll start to investigate the structure of your plan.</v>

455
00:16:29.161 --> 00:16:31.630
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you'll start to investigate the structure of the world.</v>

456
00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:34.390
<v Speaker 1>And then from a constructivist perspective,</v>

457
00:16:34.391 --> 00:16:35.830
<v Speaker 1>say once you start to do that,</v>

458
00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:38.200
<v Speaker 1>you gather information from the world,</v>

459
00:16:38.201 --> 00:16:41.410
<v Speaker 1>and then you remake your plan and you remake your conception of the world,</v>

460
00:16:41.411 --> 00:16:42.700
<v Speaker 1>and then you could move on.</v>

461
00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:47.170
<v Speaker 1>So you do that under the guidance of the positive and the negative emotions.</v>
