1
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm concerned about the obsession with the people obsessing too much about the</v>

2
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:12.630
<v Speaker 1>afterlife,</v>

3
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.710
<v Speaker 1>not just religious people,</v>

4
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:14.840
<v Speaker 1>but scientists.</v>

5
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:15.883
<v Speaker 1>It's what I call it,</v>

6
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.600
<v Speaker 1>the afterlife for atheists.</v>

7
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.520
<v Speaker 1>The core of my book is really about all the cryonics people in the</v>

8
00:00:23.521 --> 00:00:24.450
<v Speaker 1>transhumanists,</v>

9
00:00:24.451 --> 00:00:28.830
<v Speaker 1>in the singular Terry ends and the extropians and the people that are going to</v>

10
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.530
<v Speaker 1>upload your mind into a computer and turn it off.</v>

11
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.221
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

12
00:00:32.221 --> 00:00:33.750
<v Speaker 1>ray Kurzweil and all these guys,</v>

13
00:00:33.751 --> 00:00:33.961
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:34.380
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

15
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.690
<v Speaker 1>they're almost gurus when you go to these conferences,</v>

16
00:00:36.691 --> 00:00:36.901
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:38.130
<v Speaker 1>it's like we get to live forever.</v>

18
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.310
<v Speaker 1>We are the generation that gets delivered.</v>

19
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.100
<v Speaker 2>They're the generation that's going to instantiate the daddy in the form of</v>

20
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.200
<v Speaker 2>computational entity as well.</v>

21
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.111
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

22
00:00:49.111 --> 00:00:49.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

23
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.070
<v Speaker 1>Kurzweil even has a funny line about that.</v>

24
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.250
<v Speaker 1>Is there a god?</v>

25
00:00:53.251 --> 00:00:53.431
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

26
00:00:53.431 --> 00:00:54.720
<v Speaker 1>if there's going to be pretty soon,</v>

27
00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:56.010
<v Speaker 1>as soon as we hit the singularity,</v>

28
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.110
<v Speaker 1>and so I've been to the singularity summit.</v>

29
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.340
<v Speaker 1>It reminds me of what I was religious.</v>

30
00:01:02.341 --> 00:01:02.530
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

31
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.870
<v Speaker 1>I used to be an evangelical,</v>

32
00:01:03.871 --> 00:01:05.190
<v Speaker 1>I went to Pepperdine University,</v>

33
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

34
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.280
<v Speaker 1>which is a church of Christ school.</v>

35
00:01:08.281 --> 00:01:09.300
<v Speaker 1>I was really into it.</v>

36
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.621
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

37
00:01:09.621 --> 00:01:09.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

38
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.760
<v Speaker 1>and going to church and all that stuff.</v>

39
00:01:11.761 --> 00:01:12.120
<v Speaker 1>And I get,</v>

40
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.890
<v Speaker 1>I go to the singularity summit and it's like,</v>

41
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:14.191
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

42
00:01:14.191 --> 00:01:15.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm back in church.</v>

43
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.770
<v Speaker 1>Here's Ray Kurzweil grew up there telling us we are the first generation that</v>

44
00:01:20.971 --> 00:01:21.840
<v Speaker 1>will live forever.</v>

45
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:22.910
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

46
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:23.630
<v Speaker 1>operating gray,</v>

47
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:24.930
<v Speaker 1>this radical life extension,</v>

48
00:01:24.931 --> 00:01:25.500
<v Speaker 1>the scientists,</v>

49
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.681
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

50
00:01:25.681 --> 00:01:25.920
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

51
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.040
<v Speaker 1>he's on record saying the first person to live a thousand years is,</v>

52
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.150
<v Speaker 1>is born now,</v>

53
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.410
<v Speaker 1>is this alive now?</v>

54
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.861
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

55
00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:34.410
<v Speaker 2>So there's two elements to,</v>

56
00:01:34.411 --> 00:01:36.090
<v Speaker 2>they have an issue that we can discuss them.</v>

57
00:01:36.091 --> 00:01:41.091
<v Speaker 2>And one is the belief in the existence of heaven and the other is the positing</v>

58
00:01:42.331 --> 00:01:43.480
<v Speaker 2>of heaven as an Ame.</v>

59
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:45.090
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

60
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.831
<v Speaker 2>those are interesting.</v>

61
00:01:45.831 --> 00:01:46.651
<v Speaker 2>We related.</v>

62
00:01:46.651 --> 00:01:49.170
<v Speaker 2>So from my perspective from,</v>

63
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.810
<v Speaker 2>so one of the things as far as I'd be able to tell,</v>

64
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.210
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that allows us to transform the reality that's too complicated</v>

65
00:01:57.211 --> 00:02:01.310
<v Speaker 2>to perceive into these functional low resolution icon,</v>

66
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.010
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

67
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.843
<v Speaker 2>is an aim.</v>

68
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.300
<v Speaker 2>You have to aim right and you have to aim with your eyes.</v>

69
00:02:06.301 --> 00:02:06.961
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>

70
00:02:06.961 --> 00:02:10.680
<v Speaker 2>we're also extraordinarily good at detecting how other people aim with their</v>

71
00:02:10.681 --> 00:02:11.514
<v Speaker 2>eyes.</v>

72
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.440
<v Speaker 2>So the question is always,</v>

73
00:02:16.441 --> 00:02:17.840
<v Speaker 2>well where should you aim?</v>

74
00:02:17.841 --> 00:02:20.150
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to that archetypally I would say,</v>

75
00:02:20.151 --> 00:02:24.150
<v Speaker 2>and biologically for that matter is that you should aim up because why the hell</v>

76
00:02:24.151 --> 00:02:25.140
<v Speaker 2>would you aim down?</v>

77
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.340
<v Speaker 2>Down is hell.</v>

78
00:02:26.341 --> 00:02:29.790
<v Speaker 2>Right down is where the suffering is down is where the malevolence is.</v>

79
00:02:29.791 --> 00:02:33.690
<v Speaker 2>So you aim up and architecturally op is heaven.</v>

80
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.420
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things that I can't,</v>

81
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.860
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me that there's some possibility that it was impossible for human</v>

82
00:02:40.861 --> 00:02:42.720
<v Speaker 2>beings to discover the future,</v>

83
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.520
<v Speaker 2>which is something that we seem to have done.</v>

84
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.380
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that was pre frontal extension and that was the,</v>

85
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.720
<v Speaker 2>the expansion of the prefrontal cortex and its deep wiring with the visual</v>

86
00:02:51.721 --> 00:02:54.660
<v Speaker 2>cortex that actually enabled us to foresee the future.</v>

87
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:55.523
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>

88
00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you can foresee the future without stumbling upon the idea of</v>

89
00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:02.770
<v Speaker 2>heaven at the same time,</v>

90
00:03:02.771 --> 00:03:04.320
<v Speaker 2>because they haven't,</v>

91
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.350
<v Speaker 2>in that sense,</v>

92
00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:09.550
<v Speaker 2>becomes the best possible future and you're aiming out,</v>

93
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.650
<v Speaker 2>you're aiming at a better future,</v>

94
00:03:11.651 --> 00:03:13.630
<v Speaker 2>and because you're ending out a better future,</v>

95
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.290
<v Speaker 2>you're kind of compelled to also conceptualize at least in principle,</v>

96
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.960
<v Speaker 2>like the platonic ideal of the future.</v>

97
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.370
<v Speaker 2>And so then that future potential starts to become kind of a reality.</v>

98
00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:25.450
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>

99
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.491
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

100
00:03:26.491 --> 00:03:27.690
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a super good point.</v>

101
00:03:27.691 --> 00:03:28.080
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

102
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.341
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

103
00:03:28.341 --> 00:03:33.060
<v Speaker 1>my concern about obsessing too much about the next life as you're going to miss</v>

104
00:03:33.061 --> 00:03:34.020
<v Speaker 1>out on this life,</v>

105
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.310
<v Speaker 1>which is where you live right now.</v>

106
00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.510
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

107
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.781
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

108
00:03:36.781 --> 00:03:38.580
<v Speaker 1>but that's different from aiming at it.</v>

109
00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

110
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:39.131
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

111
00:03:39.131 --> 00:03:39.720
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

112
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.070
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a book on moral progress,</v>

113
00:03:41.071 --> 00:03:41.904
<v Speaker 1>the moral arc,</v>

114
00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.150
<v Speaker 1>they mean for incremental improvements in civil rights and health and longevity</v>

115
00:03:47.491 --> 00:03:48.060
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

116
00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.200
<v Speaker 1>and ridding ourselves of disease and war.</v>

117
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.840
<v Speaker 1>These are all admirable goals and we should keep doing that aiming for</v>

118
00:03:54.841 --> 00:03:55.530
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

119
00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.600
<v Speaker 1>And I do like the metaphor up because</v>

120
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.560
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's because we're a social hierarchical</v>

121
00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:02.503
<v Speaker 2>species.</v>

122
00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.290
<v Speaker 2>I think that's why the pyramids,</v>

123
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.430
<v Speaker 2>I believe that.</v>

124
00:04:05.431 --> 00:04:07.590
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what the pyramids represent with her,</v>

125
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:08.790
<v Speaker 2>with their gold cap.</v>

126
00:04:08.791 --> 00:04:09.061
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

127
00:04:09.061 --> 00:04:09.670
<v Speaker 2>It's</v>

128
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:10.503
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

129
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.360
<v Speaker 2>And The Washington monument does the same thing.</v>

130
00:04:13.361 --> 00:04:14.194
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

131
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.240
<v Speaker 1>Or The pyramid of hierarchy of needs and so on.</v>
