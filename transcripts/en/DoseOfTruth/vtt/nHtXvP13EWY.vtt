1
00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.610
<v Speaker 1>So I was thinking the other day</v>

2
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:12.753
<v Speaker 1>about</v>

3
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.853
<v Speaker 1>numbers.</v>

4
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.781
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5
00:00:16.781 --> 00:00:21.340
<v Speaker 1>there are mathematicians who think that there isn't anything more real,</v>

6
00:00:21.341 --> 00:00:22.180
<v Speaker 1>the numbers.</v>

7
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.450
<v Speaker 1>And that's an interesting proposition.</v>

8
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's obviously the case that once you invent or discover numbers that</v>

9
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.750
<v Speaker 1>that confers on you a tremendous power.</v>

10
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.230
<v Speaker 1>Who knows the limits of that power and</v>

11
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.410
<v Speaker 1>the claim that numbers are more real than anything else is predicated in part on</v>

12
00:00:48.781 --> 00:00:52.650
<v Speaker 1>the fact that when you discover the marine vent them and start to utilize them,</v>

13
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.040
<v Speaker 1>that your ability to operate in the world expands immensely.</v>

14
00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.850
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

15
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.050
<v Speaker 1>and so that's one of the ways of judging whether or not something is real is</v>

16
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.690
<v Speaker 1>whether or not when you use it,</v>

17
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.070
<v Speaker 1>that facilitates your means of operating in the world.</v>

18
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.733
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly,</v>

19
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.440
<v Speaker 1>numbers are abstractions.</v>

20
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.500
<v Speaker 1>And so that raises another question,</v>

21
00:01:19.501 --> 00:01:20.334
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

22
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:23.403
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

23
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.090
<v Speaker 1>what's more real?</v>

24
00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.930
<v Speaker 1>The thing that's being abstracted from or the abstractions.</v>

25
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:33.371
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

26
00:01:33.371 --> 00:01:34.480
<v Speaker 1>that's not obvious.</v>

27
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

28
00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.290
<v Speaker 1>and maybe the question of more real isn't Germane.</v>

29
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.420
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's a question of equal reality,</v>

30
00:01:40.421 --> 00:01:44.860
<v Speaker 1>but it's not obvious that abstractions aren't real and you can make a damn</v>

31
00:01:44.861 --> 00:01:47.350
<v Speaker 1>strong case that they're more real than anything else.</v>

32
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.570
<v Speaker 1>And so then you might ask yourself,</v>

33
00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.290
<v Speaker 1>well then what are the most real abstractions?</v>

34
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.640
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what I'm going to start to talk about tonight.</v>

35
00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to talk about it in relationship to as many rules as I can</v>

36
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.850
<v Speaker 1>layout simultaneously.</v>

37
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.800
<v Speaker 1>I'll go through the rules first.</v>

38
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:15.730
<v Speaker 1>So rule one is stand up straight with your shoulders back and rule two is treat</v>

39
00:02:18.441 --> 00:02:23.441
<v Speaker 1>yourself like you're someone responsible for helping a number three,</v>

40
00:02:24.291 --> 00:02:26.810
<v Speaker 1>which is very tightly associated with number two.</v>

41
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.550
<v Speaker 1>They're sort of variations on a theme is make friends with those people who want</v>

42
00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:32.540
<v Speaker 1>the best for you.</v>

43
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.670
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

44
00:02:34.671 --> 00:02:38.960
<v Speaker 1>these last two rules aren't injunctions designed to make your life easier.</v>

45
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.680
<v Speaker 1>They're actually injunctions designed to make your life more difficult.</v>

46
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.093
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

47
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.180
<v Speaker 1>Kierkegaard said at one point that his role in life,</v>

48
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.280
<v Speaker 1>given that everything was proceeding to become easier and easier in all possible</v>

49
00:02:52.281 --> 00:02:52.731
<v Speaker 1>ways,</v>

50
00:02:52.731 --> 00:02:56.450
<v Speaker 1>that there would come a time when people would cry out for difficulty.</v>

51
00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 1>And so that's partly how he envisioned his role in the world.</v>

52
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.990
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly enough,</v>

53
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.910
<v Speaker 1>as a universal benefactor of mankind who had strived to do nothing other than to</v>

54
00:03:06.911 --> 00:03:09.100
<v Speaker 1>make life more difficult for everyone.</v>

55
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.060
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

56
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.620
<v Speaker 1>And so rule two and three are like that because treat yourself as if you're</v>

57
00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:18.850
<v Speaker 1>someone responsible for helping isn't the same as be nice to yourself.</v>

58
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.923
<v Speaker 1>It's not that.</v>

59
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.430
<v Speaker 1>And to associate with people who want the best for you means that they get to</v>

60
00:03:24.431 --> 00:03:26.050
<v Speaker 1>demand the best from you.</v>

61
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.300
<v Speaker 1>And that's also not an easy thing.</v>

62
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.750
<v Speaker 1>Rule four is compare yourself to who you were yesterday and not to someone else</v>

63
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:35.403
<v Speaker 1>is today.</v>

64
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.390
<v Speaker 1>And that's an injunction about envy,</v>

65
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

66
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:39.663
<v Speaker 1>It's easy.</v>

67
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.920
<v Speaker 1>You need people who you need things that are above you because you need to do</v>

68
00:03:44.921 --> 00:03:46.570
<v Speaker 1>something worthwhile with your life.</v>

69
00:03:46.571 --> 00:03:47.650
<v Speaker 1>You need something to aim at.</v>

70
00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:52.330
<v Speaker 1>But one of the consequences of that is that you can become envious of people</v>

71
00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:56.740
<v Speaker 1>that you believe have attained more in a deserved or undeserved manner.</v>

72
00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.330
<v Speaker 1>And that can make you better.</v>

73
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.100
<v Speaker 1>And so it's much better to compare yourself to yourself and to use yourself as</v>

74
00:04:03.101 --> 00:04:04.840
<v Speaker 1>the target for improvement.</v>

75
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:05.673
<v Speaker 1>And comparison.</v>

76
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.580
<v Speaker 1>Rule five is don't let your children do anything that makes you dislike them.</v>

77
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.970
<v Speaker 1>And the rule of thumb there is if you dislike them,</v>

78
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.030
<v Speaker 1>then other people will and it's a bad idea to allow your children to act in a</v>

79
00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:23.470
<v Speaker 1>way that makes other children dislike them or adults dislike them,</v>

80
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.770
<v Speaker 1>given that they're going to have to deal with children and they're going to have</v>

81
00:04:26.771 --> 00:04:27.790
<v Speaker 1>to deal with adults.</v>

82
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.970
<v Speaker 1>So your primary responsibility as a parent is to help your child learn how to</v>

83
00:04:33.281 --> 00:04:38.281
<v Speaker 1>behave so that the social world opens up its arms to them and welcomes them at</v>

84
00:04:39.611 --> 00:04:42.370
<v Speaker 1>every level and you've done your job.</v>

85
00:04:42.371 --> 00:04:43.540
<v Speaker 1>If you can manage that,</v>

86
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:44.920
<v Speaker 1>and it's not a simple thing to do,</v>

87
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:50.130
<v Speaker 1>rural six is put your house in perfect order before you criticize the world and</v>

88
00:04:51.221 --> 00:04:56.221
<v Speaker 1>that's not take no action for others until you have your act together.</v>

89
00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.650
<v Speaker 1>That isn't what the rule means.</v>

90
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.980
<v Speaker 1>It means that bind your ambition with humility and work on what's right in front</v>

91
00:05:07.841 --> 00:05:12.841
<v Speaker 1>of you that you will suffer for if you get wrong before you engage in the large</v>

92
00:05:13.631 --> 00:05:16.150
<v Speaker 1>scale transformation of other people.</v>

93
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.570
<v Speaker 1>Rule seven is do what is meaningful and not what is expedient.</v>

94
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.970
<v Speaker 1>And I would say in some sense,</v>

95
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:26.500
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>

96
00:05:26.501 --> 00:05:30.160
<v Speaker 1>that's the core ethos of the book,</v>

97
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.680
<v Speaker 1>not exactly because rule eight,</v>

98
00:05:32.681 --> 00:05:37.681
<v Speaker 1>which is tell the truth or at least don't lie as a necessary conjunction to that</v>

99
00:05:37.991 --> 00:05:40.120
<v Speaker 1>are unnecessary additional element.</v>

100
00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.140
<v Speaker 1>Because I don't think that you can pursue what is meaningful without telling the</v>

101
00:05:44.141 --> 00:05:44.974
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>

102
00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.250
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is if you don't tell the truth or let's say if you lie,</v>

103
00:05:48.251 --> 00:05:49.690
<v Speaker 1>which is an easier way to think about it,</v>

104
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.360
<v Speaker 1>you corrupt the mechanisms,</v>

105
00:05:52.361 --> 00:05:57.361
<v Speaker 1>the instinctual mechanisms that that that manifest themselves as meaning and</v>

106
00:05:58.251 --> 00:05:59.420
<v Speaker 1>then you can't trust them.</v>

107
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.670
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very bad idea.</v>

108
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:07.010
<v Speaker 1>So the fundamental reason to not lie is because you corrupt your own</v>

109
00:06:07.011 --> 00:06:07.671
<v Speaker 1>perceptions.</v>

110
00:06:07.671 --> 00:06:10.400
<v Speaker 1>If you lie and when you corrupt your own perceptions,</v>

111
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.200
<v Speaker 1>then you can't rely on yourself.</v>

112
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:13.880
<v Speaker 1>And if you can't rely on yourself,</v>

113
00:06:13.881 --> 00:06:14.551
<v Speaker 1>then well,</v>

114
00:06:14.551 --> 00:06:19.130
<v Speaker 1>good luck to you because what are you going to rely on in the absence of your</v>

115
00:06:19.131 --> 00:06:19.964
<v Speaker 1>own judgment?</v>

116
00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:20.963
<v Speaker 1>Here,</v>

117
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.011
<v Speaker 1>you've got nothing.</v>

118
00:06:22.011 --> 00:06:22.430
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

119
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.140
<v Speaker 1>if you lose that rule,</v>

120
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:25.993
<v Speaker 1>rule eight</v>

121
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:28.663
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

122
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:29.361
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

123
00:06:29.361 --> 00:06:30.290
<v Speaker 1>tell the truth or don't,</v>

124
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.550
<v Speaker 1>or at least don't lie.</v>

125
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:32.593
<v Speaker 1>Rule nine,</v>

126
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.920
<v Speaker 1>assume that the person that you're listening to know something you don't.</v>

127
00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.790
<v Speaker 1>And that's not so much a mark of respect for the person,</v>

128
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:45.820
<v Speaker 1>although it is that it's a mark of recognition of your own unbearable ignorance.</v>

129
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:46.760
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

130
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:51.760
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you have to do in life is decide whether you're more,</v>

131
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.060
<v Speaker 1>you have to make friends more with,</v>

132
00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:56.990
<v Speaker 1>let me see,</v>

133
00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.530
<v Speaker 1>let me just,</v>

134
00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.330
<v Speaker 1>let me rephrase that properly.</v>

135
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.540
<v Speaker 1>You have to decide what's more important,</v>

136
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:04.490
<v Speaker 1>what you know or what you don't know.</v>

137
00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:05.961
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

138
00:07:05.961 --> 00:07:07.520
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of what you don't know.</v>

139
00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.790
<v Speaker 1>And so if you make friends with that,</v>

140
00:07:10.791 --> 00:07:12.050
<v Speaker 1>if you decide that's important,</v>

141
00:07:12.051 --> 00:07:15.290
<v Speaker 1>then well that's a good thing because you're going to be surrounded by what you</v>

142
00:07:15.291 --> 00:07:16.820
<v Speaker 1>don't know your entire life.</v>

143
00:07:16.821 --> 00:07:19.220
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're appreciative of that,</v>

144
00:07:19.221 --> 00:07:21.650
<v Speaker 1>then that's going to make things go better for you.</v>

145
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:22.843
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

146
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:25.640
<v Speaker 1>but the other element of that is,</v>

147
00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:26.811
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

148
00:07:26.811 --> 00:07:31.040
<v Speaker 1>why should you be appreciative of what you don't know and answer to that is,</v>

149
00:07:31.041 --> 00:07:31.281
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

150
00:07:31.281 --> 00:07:31.791
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't.</v>

151
00:07:31.791 --> 00:07:36.680
<v Speaker 1>If you're life is absolutely perfect in every way you have exactly what you need</v>

152
00:07:36.681 --> 00:07:37.514
<v Speaker 1>and want.</v>

153
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:39.890
<v Speaker 1>You've put everything in order around you,</v>

154
00:07:39.891 --> 00:07:41.300
<v Speaker 1>then what you know is sufficient.</v>

155
00:07:41.301 --> 00:07:46.301
<v Speaker 1>But if you believe that things could still be put right around you in your own</v>

156
00:07:46.911 --> 00:07:50.600
<v Speaker 1>personal life and with regard to the effect that you have another people,</v>

157
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:54.500
<v Speaker 1>then obviously what you don't yet know is more important than what you do know.</v>

158
00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:58.280
<v Speaker 1>And you should be paying attention to find out what you don't know at every</v>

159
00:07:58.281 --> 00:07:59.300
<v Speaker 1>possible moment.</v>

160
00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.990
<v Speaker 1>And if you're fortunate when you have a conversation with someone and you're</v>

161
00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:05.660
<v Speaker 1>actually interested in what they say,</v>

162
00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:09.110
<v Speaker 1>then even if they're not very good at communicating,</v>

163
00:08:09.111 --> 00:08:12.560
<v Speaker 1>even if they're awkward or even if they display a certain amount of enmity</v>

164
00:08:12.561 --> 00:08:13.394
<v Speaker 1>towards you,</v>

165
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:17.420
<v Speaker 1>there's always the possibility that they might tell you something you don't</v>

166
00:08:17.421 --> 00:08:18.020
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

167
00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:22.850
<v Speaker 1>in which case you can walk away from the conversation less ignorant and corrupt.</v>

168
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.640
<v Speaker 1>Then you were when you started the conversation.</v>

169
00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:29.690
<v Speaker 1>And if your life isn't everything that you would like it to be than being</v>

170
00:08:29.691 --> 00:08:34.691
<v Speaker 1>slightly less ignorant and corrupt is probably a good thing and so rule 10 is be</v>

171
00:08:36.381 --> 00:08:38.780
<v Speaker 1>precise in your speech and that's,</v>

172
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:40.430
<v Speaker 1>that's an observation.</v>

173
00:08:40.431 --> 00:08:45.431
<v Speaker 1>I would say that that's a variant of a new testament injunction,</v>

174
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:46.873
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

175
00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:51.680
<v Speaker 1>or maybe a description of the nature of the world which is knock and the door</v>

176
00:08:51.681 --> 00:08:54.050
<v Speaker 1>will open and ask and you will receive,</v>

177
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:58.140
<v Speaker 1>which is a very strange theory let's say,</v>

178
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:03.090
<v Speaker 1>but which I would say is far more in accordance with what we know about the</v>

179
00:09:03.091 --> 00:09:04.740
<v Speaker 1>psychology of perception,</v>

180
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:05.850
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

181
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:10.230
<v Speaker 1>Then you might imagine because it is the case that</v>

182
00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:12.810
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

183
00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:14.580
<v Speaker 1>you don't get what you don't aim at.</v>

184
00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.470
<v Speaker 1>You might get what you do a mat and your aim might get better as you aim as</v>

185
00:09:20.471 --> 00:09:20.711
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

186
00:09:20.711 --> 00:09:22.000
<v Speaker 1>which is something to consider.</v>

187
00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:24.123
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

188
00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:27.190
<v Speaker 1>If you specify the nature of the,</v>

189
00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:28.511
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

190
00:09:28.511 --> 00:09:32.530
<v Speaker 1>if you specify the nature of the being that you want to bring into being,</v>

191
00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:35.860
<v Speaker 1>then you radically increase the probability that that's what will occur.</v>

192
00:09:35.861 --> 00:09:39.970
<v Speaker 1>And of course you all know that because you regard yourself at least to some</v>

193
00:09:39.971 --> 00:09:43.270
<v Speaker 1>degree as active creative agents,</v>

194
00:09:43.271 --> 00:09:43.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

195
00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:48.570
<v Speaker 1>Your fundamental attitude towards yourself at at least in the manner that you</v>

196
00:09:49.211 --> 00:09:54.160
<v Speaker 1>act towards yourself is that you wake up in the morning and you have a landscape</v>

197
00:09:54.161 --> 00:09:59.161
<v Speaker 1>of possibilities that lay themselves open to you and you make choices between</v>

198
00:09:59.291 --> 00:10:03.760
<v Speaker 1>those possibilities and determined in consequence how the world is going to</v>

199
00:10:03.761 --> 00:10:04.750
<v Speaker 1>manifest itself.</v>

200
00:10:04.751 --> 00:10:07.210
<v Speaker 1>So you confront a field of potential.</v>

201
00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.740
<v Speaker 1>That's a good way of thinking about it.</v>

202
00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:13.120
<v Speaker 1>And through your choices you determine which elements of that potential are</v>

203
00:10:13.121 --> 00:10:18.121
<v Speaker 1>going to concretize them selves into the real world and you are very unhappy</v>

204
00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:21.370
<v Speaker 1>with yourself.</v>

205
00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:24.850
<v Speaker 1>If you don't do that properly and you're very unhappy with other people.</v>

206
00:10:24.851 --> 00:10:28.540
<v Speaker 1>If they don't do that properly and you're very unhappy with other people if they</v>

207
00:10:28.541 --> 00:10:33.541
<v Speaker 1>don't treat you like that's what you're like because part of what you demand</v>

208
00:10:34.631 --> 00:10:39.631
<v Speaker 1>from people let's say in terms of sheer civility is that they act towards you is</v>

209
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.470
<v Speaker 1>if you're the locus of voluntary choice in a world of potential and you are</v>

210
00:10:44.471 --> 00:10:45.940
<v Speaker 1>braid each other for that as well.</v>

211
00:10:45.941 --> 00:10:48.790
<v Speaker 1>If you have children and parents,</v>

212
00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:49.990
<v Speaker 1>your parents will say to you,</v>

213
00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:52.960
<v Speaker 1>if you're fortunate you're not living up to your potential,</v>

214
00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:56.050
<v Speaker 1>which is actually a compliment in a sense.</v>

215
00:10:56.051 --> 00:11:01.051
<v Speaker 1>Even though it's also a judgment and the compliment is I know perfectly well</v>

216
00:11:01.541 --> 00:11:05.080
<v Speaker 1>that you could be more than you are and you'll hang your head if you have any</v>

217
00:11:05.081 --> 00:11:05.441
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

218
00:11:05.441 --> 00:11:09.340
<v Speaker 1>And you'll think like you think in relationship to your own conscience that yes</v>

219
00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:13.240
<v Speaker 1>I have a lot of potential that I'm not fully realizing and that actually</v>

220
00:11:13.241 --> 00:11:17.710
<v Speaker 1>constitutes a transgression against the good and I don't,</v>

221
00:11:17.711 --> 00:11:21.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I've ever met anyone who doesn't believe that if you,</v>

222
00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:24.880
<v Speaker 1>if you have a reasonable conversation with them,</v>

223
00:11:24.881 --> 00:11:27.580
<v Speaker 1>it just seems self evident.</v>

224
00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:31.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe now and then you meet someone who's narcissistically self satisfied</v>

225
00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:34.450
<v Speaker 1>but then they're narcissistic and that's not good.</v>

226
00:11:34.451 --> 00:11:34.991
<v Speaker 1>That as a,</v>

227
00:11:34.991 --> 00:11:37.060
<v Speaker 1>as a medium to long term strategy,</v>

228
00:11:37.061 --> 00:11:39.580
<v Speaker 1>that's a catastrophe that ends in disaster.</v>

229
00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:40.301
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

230
00:11:40.301 --> 00:11:41.260
<v Speaker 1>it's a short term,</v>

231
00:11:41.261 --> 00:11:42.220
<v Speaker 1>it protects people,</v>

232
00:11:42.221 --> 00:11:44.020
<v Speaker 1>but long term it's,</v>

233
00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:45.640
<v Speaker 1>it's not good in the least.</v>

234
00:11:45.641 --> 00:11:47.650
<v Speaker 1>And of course other people know to appreciate it as well.</v>

235
00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:52.750
<v Speaker 1>Rule 11 is don't bother children when they're skateboarding and that's actually</v>

236
00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:54.820
<v Speaker 1>a discussion of courage,</v>

237
00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:56.110
<v Speaker 1>of encouragement more,</v>

238
00:11:56.111 --> 00:11:58.360
<v Speaker 1>more specifically because I've,</v>

239
00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:00.610
<v Speaker 1>I've been trying to understand for example,</v>

240
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:05.290
<v Speaker 1>what role parents play in the lives of their children and I would say this is a</v>

241
00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:06.124
<v Speaker 1>role that,</v>

242
00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:11.730
<v Speaker 1>that that is a fundamental importance as well as attempting to guide your</v>

243
00:12:12.041 --> 00:12:17.041
<v Speaker 1>children so that they act in a socially desirable manner so that the world opens</v>

244
00:12:17.081 --> 00:12:18.070
<v Speaker 1>itself up to them.</v>

245
00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:20.800
<v Speaker 1>You also want to encourage them,</v>

246
00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.080
<v Speaker 1>which is not the same as sheltering them.</v>

247
00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:24.970
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same at all.</v>

248
00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:28.120
<v Speaker 1>And to encourage someone is to say something like,</v>

249
00:12:28.121 --> 00:12:29.590
<v Speaker 1>or to act out something like,</v>

250
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:30.131
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

251
00:12:30.131 --> 00:12:30.964
<v Speaker 1>kid,</v>

252
00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.230
<v Speaker 1>as you meet,</v>

253
00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:36.940
<v Speaker 1>the world's already difficult because the world isn't easy for children any more</v>

254
00:12:36.941 --> 00:12:37.121
<v Speaker 1>than,</v>

255
00:12:37.121 --> 00:12:39.280
<v Speaker 1>it's easy for adults that the difficulties are,</v>

256
00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:40.570
<v Speaker 1>they're not the same,</v>

257
00:12:40.571 --> 00:12:42.100
<v Speaker 1>their child's size difficulties,</v>

258
00:12:42.101 --> 00:12:43.720
<v Speaker 1>but there are still difficulties.</v>

259
00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:49.560
<v Speaker 1>The world is a very hard place and it's a bitter place in many ways and it's not</v>

260
00:12:50.381 --> 00:12:51.790
<v Speaker 1>only a hard and bitter place.</v>

261
00:12:51.791 --> 00:12:56.230
<v Speaker 1>It's also touched with betrayal and malevolence and that's the fundamental</v>

262
00:12:56.231 --> 00:12:57.064
<v Speaker 1>bottom line,</v>

263
00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:02.400
<v Speaker 1>but there's something in you that is capable of taking that full on and</v>

264
00:13:03.731 --> 00:13:07.270
<v Speaker 1>transcending it and that's encouragement.</v>

265
00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:07.931
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

266
00:13:07.931 --> 00:13:08.764
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

267
00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:13.770
<v Speaker 1>as difficult as things are Europe to the challenge and to interfere with</v>

268
00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.110
<v Speaker 1>children when they're skateboarding,</v>

269
00:13:17.111 --> 00:13:17.681
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

270
00:13:17.681 --> 00:13:18.514
<v Speaker 1>when they're doing,</v>

271
00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:22.270
<v Speaker 1>let's say in advisably dangerous things,</v>

272
00:13:22.271 --> 00:13:23.560
<v Speaker 1>which kids of course do,</v>

273
00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:24.850
<v Speaker 1>if they're skateboarding,</v>

274
00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:30.690
<v Speaker 1>to interfere with that is to interfere with the child's willingness to</v>

275
00:13:31.601 --> 00:13:36.550
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily expose themselves to the risks that they need to expose themselves</v>

276
00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:42.160
<v Speaker 1>to in order to develop this sort of competence that allows them to thrive in a</v>

277
00:13:42.161 --> 00:13:44.350
<v Speaker 1>world they cannot be sheltered from.</v>

278
00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:50.760
<v Speaker 1>And so to interfere with children when they're taking necessary risks is not</v>

279
00:13:51.221 --> 00:13:52.510
<v Speaker 1>love or empathy,</v>

280
00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:57.010
<v Speaker 1>but cowardice on the part of parents and it's deeply damaging to children.</v>

281
00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:59.440
<v Speaker 1>And I can tell you as a clinical psychologist,</v>

282
00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:04.470
<v Speaker 1>I've never had a client come to my office in all the hundreds in,</v>

283
00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:08.980
<v Speaker 1>in all of the hundreds of encounters I've had with people in my office,</v>

284
00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:13.810
<v Speaker 1>I've never had a client say my parents made me two independent,</v>

285
00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:15.790
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

286
00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:17.860
<v Speaker 1>That hasn't happened once.</v>

287
00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:23.610
<v Speaker 1>Right now my parents made me too dependent or I conspired with my parents to</v>

288
00:14:25.451 --> 00:14:27.550
<v Speaker 1>perpetuate my dependence.</v>

289
00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:29.950
<v Speaker 1>That happened all the time.</v>

290
00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.250
<v Speaker 1>So there's a rule of thumb,</v>

291
00:14:33.251 --> 00:14:34.330
<v Speaker 1>which I think is a good one,</v>

292
00:14:34.331 --> 00:14:38.530
<v Speaker 1>which I believe is often applied to nursing homes by people who work in nursing</v>

293
00:14:38.531 --> 00:14:38.831
<v Speaker 1>homes,</v>

294
00:14:38.831 --> 00:14:40.630
<v Speaker 1>which is of course a very difficult job.</v>

295
00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:45.370
<v Speaker 1>And the rule is do not do anything for anyone they can do for themselves.</v>

296
00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:48.850
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that it's a form of theft,</v>

297
00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:50.051
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

298
00:14:50.051 --> 00:14:50.411
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>

299
00:14:50.411 --> 00:14:51.140
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

300
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:51.680
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

301
00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:55.430
<v Speaker 1>if you do something for someone and it facilitates their movement forward,</v>

302
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:58.490
<v Speaker 1>then they moved forward because you help them,</v>

303
00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:02.060
<v Speaker 1>which is something I was very careful about as a therapist.</v>

304
00:15:02.061 --> 00:15:05.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to give my clients advice first.</v>

305
00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:06.920
<v Speaker 1>It might fail,</v>

306
00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:09.920
<v Speaker 1>in which case they are going to pay for my advice.</v>

307
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:11.000
<v Speaker 1>And second,</v>

308
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:11.960
<v Speaker 1>if it succeeds,</v>

309
00:15:11.961 --> 00:15:14.640
<v Speaker 1>then I get to be the successful one.</v>

310
00:15:14.641 --> 00:15:17.660
<v Speaker 1>And I don't want to steal the success from my clients.</v>

311
00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:19.010
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad idea.</v>

312
00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:24.170
<v Speaker 1>I want to help them figure out what it is that they should aim at and then help</v>

313
00:15:24.171 --> 00:15:26.210
<v Speaker 1>plot out a strategy for attaining that.</v>

314
00:15:26.211 --> 00:15:26.600
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

315
00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.051
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

316
00:15:27.051 --> 00:15:27.360
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

317
00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:30.800
<v Speaker 1>I want to ensure that it's their destiny,</v>

318
00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:32.870
<v Speaker 1>not something I'm imposing.</v>

319
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.620
<v Speaker 1>And of course the imposition of that sort of thing is the hallmark of a bad,</v>

320
00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.570
<v Speaker 1>I would say therapeutic relationship,</v>

321
00:15:38.571 --> 00:15:41.420
<v Speaker 1>but also a bad relationship period.</v>

322
00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:42.381
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

323
00:15:42.381 --> 00:15:45.170
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things you want to do with your partners,</v>

324
00:15:45.171 --> 00:15:45.831
<v Speaker 1>your spouse,</v>

325
00:15:45.831 --> 00:15:46.221
<v Speaker 1>your say,</v>

326
00:15:46.221 --> 00:15:48.920
<v Speaker 1>your husband or wife and also with your children,</v>

327
00:15:48.921 --> 00:15:53.270
<v Speaker 1>is to listen to them so that you can figure out what their problems are and</v>

328
00:15:53.271 --> 00:15:56.120
<v Speaker 1>figure out with them because they're going to figure that out by communicating</v>

329
00:15:56.121 --> 00:15:59.960
<v Speaker 1>and then perhaps aid them in the development of a strategy.</v>

330
00:15:59.961 --> 00:16:04.730
<v Speaker 1>But you have to ensure very carefully that you're not imposing your own</v>

331
00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:10.480
<v Speaker 1>structure in a manner that's going to steal from them what's rightfully theirs.</v>

332
00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:13.030
<v Speaker 1>So well,</v>

333
00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:18.040
<v Speaker 1>so rule 11 is an injunction to courage as the fundamental cause.</v>

334
00:16:18.141 --> 00:16:18.651
<v Speaker 1>You could say,</v>

335
00:16:18.651 --> 00:16:18.801
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

336
00:16:18.801 --> 00:16:21.140
<v Speaker 1>what's the antidote to the catastrophe of life?</v>

337
00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.090
<v Speaker 1>And one answer might be safety.</v>

338
00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:23.841
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

339
00:16:23.841 --> 00:16:24.111
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

340
00:16:24.111 --> 00:16:24.381
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

341
00:16:24.381 --> 00:16:24.800
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

342
00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:29.800
<v Speaker 1>everyone's sensible enough to know that a certain amount of provision for safety</v>

343
00:16:29.811 --> 00:16:30.440
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

344
00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:31.310
<v Speaker 1>is worthwhile.</v>

345
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:34.940
<v Speaker 1>You should probably wear your seat belts when you're driving around in your car</v>

346
00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:37.700
<v Speaker 1>because why take foolhardy risks.</v>

347
00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:41.480
<v Speaker 1>But given that there is no security in life,</v>

348
00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:43.100
<v Speaker 1>in the final analysis,</v>

349
00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:48.140
<v Speaker 1>then encouragement is a much better medication than sheltering.</v>

350
00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:50.023
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

351
00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:51.343
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>

352
00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:52.190
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

353
00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:57.190
<v Speaker 1>that's I think in keeping with the idea that what life is essentially is not a</v>

354
00:16:58.311 --> 00:17:01.850
<v Speaker 1>place to attain happiness or even to aim for happiness,</v>

355
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.940
<v Speaker 1>even though you should be grateful if someone comes along now and then,</v>

356
00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:07.280
<v Speaker 1>but a call to something like adventure.</v>

357
00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.970
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's the proper way of conceptualizing it.</v>

358
00:17:10.971 --> 00:17:13.400
<v Speaker 1>Certainly if you go watch a story,</v>

359
00:17:13.401 --> 00:17:13.851
<v Speaker 1>a movie,</v>

360
00:17:13.851 --> 00:17:14.870
<v Speaker 1>you read a book,</v>

361
00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:15.891
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

362
00:17:15.891 --> 00:17:18.800
<v Speaker 1>If you encounter a narrative that's gripping,</v>

363
00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:22.220
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a romance or a classic adventure story,</v>

364
00:17:22.221 --> 00:17:25.880
<v Speaker 1>then the element of it that's gripping is the adventure.</v>

365
00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:30.050
<v Speaker 1>And so to portray life is an adventure in romance and,</v>

366
00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.330
<v Speaker 1>and in the world is the proper way to portray it.</v>

367
00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:34.730
<v Speaker 1>And the way that you</v>

368
00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.770
<v Speaker 1>facilitate the adventure is through encouragement.</v>

369
00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:41.810
<v Speaker 1>I had a client once,</v>

370
00:17:41.811 --> 00:17:42.621
<v Speaker 1>I really liked him.</v>

371
00:17:42.621 --> 00:17:43.520
<v Speaker 1>He was a good guy.</v>

372
00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:44.403
<v Speaker 1>He's smart guy,</v>

373
00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:46.100
<v Speaker 1>good looking young guy,</v>

374
00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:48.110
<v Speaker 1>had everything going for him.</v>

375
00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:48.830
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

376
00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:49.740
<v Speaker 1>he's good musician.</v>

377
00:17:49.741 --> 00:17:50.970
<v Speaker 1>He was a talented athlete.</v>

378
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:52.343
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

379
00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:53.950
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

380
00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:55.300
<v Speaker 1>but he hadn't been encouraged.</v>

381
00:17:55.301 --> 00:17:56.134
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say,</v>

382
00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:57.303
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

383
00:17:57.690 --> 00:17:59.880
<v Speaker 1>He told me about his relationship with his girlfriend.</v>

384
00:17:59.881 --> 00:18:00.330
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

385
00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:01.163
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

386
00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:06.320
<v Speaker 1>His girlfriend wanted to go biking around southern Ontario.</v>

387
00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:12.160
<v Speaker 1>She was about 19 or 20 and he thought he might join her and when she went and</v>

388
00:18:12.261 --> 00:18:13.430
<v Speaker 1>talked to her parents,</v>

389
00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:19.300
<v Speaker 1>they made every provision possible to help her prepare for the journey to make</v>

390
00:18:19.311 --> 00:18:20.630
<v Speaker 1>sure her bike was in good shape,</v>

391
00:18:20.631 --> 00:18:23.750
<v Speaker 1>to make sure she had the right equipment to help her plot out a route.</v>

392
00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:25.880
<v Speaker 1>And when he went and talked to his parents,</v>

393
00:18:25.881 --> 00:18:30.050
<v Speaker 1>all they did was worried that he was going to get hurt and like he might get</v>

394
00:18:30.051 --> 00:18:30.884
<v Speaker 1>hurt because</v>

395
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:31.930
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

396
00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:32.830
<v Speaker 1>people get hurt,</v>

397
00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:34.443
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

398
00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:35.250
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

399
00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:38.160
<v Speaker 1>They didn't understand that they were choosing between the hurt that he might</v>

400
00:18:38.161 --> 00:18:40.800
<v Speaker 1>encounter by going out in the world and having an adventure,</v>

401
00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:44.760
<v Speaker 1>let's say with his girlfriend or the hurt that he would encounter by staying at</v>

402
00:18:44.761 --> 00:18:45.570
<v Speaker 1>home,</v>

403
00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:50.160
<v Speaker 1>cowering in his basement under the protection of his over loving parents.</v>

404
00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:50.581
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

405
00:18:50.581 --> 00:18:53.160
<v Speaker 1>his girlfriend ventured bravely into the world.</v>

406
00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:53.791
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>

407
00:18:53.791 --> 00:18:53.941
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

408
00:18:53.941 --> 00:18:56.490
<v Speaker 1>which of those two things is most likely to be damaging?</v>

409
00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:57.690
<v Speaker 1>And their answer to that is,</v>

410
00:18:57.870 --> 00:18:58.141
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

411
00:18:58.141 --> 00:19:00.230
<v Speaker 1>his parents wouldn't worry as much as if he,</v>

412
00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:05.070
<v Speaker 1>if he was in the basement and that's the wrong worry even because they should</v>

413
00:19:05.071 --> 00:19:05.940
<v Speaker 1>worry more,</v>

414
00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:07.643
<v Speaker 1>not less.</v>

415
00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:10.590
<v Speaker 1>So in rural 12 his pedicab,</v>

416
00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:13.640
<v Speaker 1>when you encounter one on the street and it's</v>

417
00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.073
<v Speaker 1>oddly enough,</v>

418
00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:18.090
<v Speaker 1>a meditation on fragility,</v>

419
00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:24.620
<v Speaker 1>it's a discussion of what you do when you don't know what to do and that's</v>

420
00:19:24.631 --> 00:19:27.270
<v Speaker 1>really when things have gone badly for you.</v>

421
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:31.860
<v Speaker 1>When you face a terrible tragedy in your own personal life or in your familiar</v>

422
00:19:31.861 --> 00:19:33.840
<v Speaker 1>life or perhaps even in the life of your community,</v>

423
00:19:33.841 --> 00:19:36.450
<v Speaker 1>when things come crowding in and you too quickly,</v>

424
00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:41.160
<v Speaker 1>in the case of a death in the family or a terrible illness or the collapse of a</v>

425
00:19:41.161 --> 00:19:46.161
<v Speaker 1>dream or any of the things that can flip your world upside down is how do you</v>

426
00:19:46.261 --> 00:19:47.041
<v Speaker 1>cope with that?</v>

427
00:19:47.041 --> 00:19:52.041
<v Speaker 1>And that chapter contains discussion of the necessity of narrowing your</v>

428
00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:55.110
<v Speaker 1>timeframe.</v>

429
00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:55.891
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

430
00:19:55.891 --> 00:19:59.670
<v Speaker 1>because sometimes the right way to look at the world is across years and</v>

431
00:19:59.671 --> 00:20:01.170
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's across months.</v>

432
00:20:01.171 --> 00:20:03.570
<v Speaker 1>And when things are more out of control,</v>

433
00:20:03.571 --> 00:20:05.520
<v Speaker 1>perhaps it's across days.</v>

434
00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:07.290
<v Speaker 1>And when things are really,</v>

435
00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:08.910
<v Speaker 1>when you're really up against the wall,</v>

436
00:20:08.911 --> 00:20:11.880
<v Speaker 1>it's across hours or even minutes.</v>

437
00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:16.770
<v Speaker 1>And during those minutes then you concentrate on doing as well as you can with</v>

438
00:20:16.771 --> 00:20:21.180
<v Speaker 1>what's right in front of you for the longest unit of time that you can tolerate,</v>

439
00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.410
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize it.</v>

440
00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.740
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's what you do at someone's deathbed.</v>

441
00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:27.990
<v Speaker 1>And while you're doing that and suffering away madly,</v>

442
00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:32.100
<v Speaker 1>then you also take the time to appreciate everything you can.</v>

443
00:20:32.101 --> 00:20:33.420
<v Speaker 1>That manifests itself,</v>

444
00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.790
<v Speaker 1>that allows itself to be appreciated.</v>

445
00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.280
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the metaphor of the cat,</v>

446
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:39.300
<v Speaker 1>I suppose.</v>

447
00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:41.220
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the 12 rules.</v>

448
00:20:41.221 --> 00:20:43.080
<v Speaker 1>And I'll return to rule one,</v>

449
00:20:43.081 --> 00:20:45.360
<v Speaker 1>which is stand up straight with your shoulders back.</v>

450
00:20:45.361 --> 00:20:50.130
<v Speaker 1>And I'm going to use it as a platform for laying out the abstractions that I</v>

451
00:20:50.131 --> 00:20:53.160
<v Speaker 1>talked to at the beginning of the lecture.</v>

452
00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:53.880
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
