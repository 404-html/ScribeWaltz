1
00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:03.011
<v Speaker 1>There was,</v>

2
00:00:03.011 --> 00:00:03.844
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:04.141
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:04.141 --> 00:00:06.740
<v Speaker 1>daddy known as Marduk and Martech.</v>

5
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:08.820
<v Speaker 1>He was a Mesopotamian Daddy.</v>

6
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.900
<v Speaker 1>And imagine this is sorta what happened is that as an empire grew out of the</v>

7
00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:15.960
<v Speaker 1>post ice age age,</v>

8
00:00:15.961 --> 00:00:17.640
<v Speaker 1>say 15,000 years ago,</v>

9
00:00:17.641 --> 00:00:18.720
<v Speaker 1>10,000 years ago,</v>

10
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.440
<v Speaker 1>all these tribes came together and these tribes each had their own daddy,</v>

11
00:00:22.441 --> 00:00:24.330
<v Speaker 1>their own image of the ideal.</v>

12
00:00:24.331 --> 00:00:26.610
<v Speaker 1>But then they started talking about it the same territory,</v>

13
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

14
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.580
<v Speaker 1>And so then one tribe had gone,</v>

15
00:00:29.581 --> 00:00:29.821
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

16
00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:33.960
<v Speaker 1>in one tribe had God be and no one could wipe the other one out.</v>

17
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.120
<v Speaker 1>And then it would just be God a who wins.</v>

18
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.690
<v Speaker 1>But that's not so good because well maybe you want to trade with those people or</v>

19
00:00:39.691 --> 00:00:42.480
<v Speaker 1>maybe you don't want to lose half of your population in a war,</v>

20
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.380
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

21
00:00:43.381 --> 00:00:48.381
<v Speaker 1>So then you have to have an argument about whose God is going to take priority,</v>

22
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.280
<v Speaker 1>which ideal is going to take priority.</v>

23
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.720
<v Speaker 1>And what seems to happen is that's represented in mythology is a battle of the</v>

24
00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:56.820
<v Speaker 1>gods in sort of celestial space.</v>

25
00:00:56.821 --> 00:00:58.740
<v Speaker 1>But from a practical perspective,</v>

26
00:00:58.741 --> 00:01:00.570
<v Speaker 1>it's more like an ongoing dialogue.</v>

27
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.501
<v Speaker 1>You believe this,</v>

28
00:01:01.501 --> 00:01:02.430
<v Speaker 1>I believe this.</v>

29
00:01:02.431 --> 00:01:03.181
<v Speaker 1>You believe that,</v>

30
00:01:03.181 --> 00:01:04.080
<v Speaker 1>I believe this.</v>

31
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.180
<v Speaker 1>How are we going to Meld that together?</v>

32
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.060
<v Speaker 1>So you take God a and you take God be and maybe what you do is extract God,</v>

33
00:01:11.061 --> 00:01:13.140
<v Speaker 1>see from them and you say,</v>

34
00:01:13.141 --> 00:01:13.621
<v Speaker 1>well God,</v>

35
00:01:13.621 --> 00:01:18.270
<v Speaker 1>see now has the attributes of a and B and then some other tribes come in and</v>

36
00:01:18.271 --> 00:01:19.980
<v Speaker 1>then see takes them over to,</v>

37
00:01:19.981 --> 00:01:22.560
<v Speaker 1>and so you get like with Marduk for example,</v>

38
00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:24.270
<v Speaker 1>he has a multitude of names,</v>

39
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.560
<v Speaker 1>50 different names.</v>

40
00:01:25.561 --> 00:01:26.520
<v Speaker 1>While those are names,</v>

41
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.980
<v Speaker 1>at least in part of the subordinate,</v>

42
00:01:28.981 --> 00:01:32.910
<v Speaker 1>God's that represented the tribes that came together to make the civilization.</v>

43
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.930
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the process by which that abstracted ideal is abstracted.</v>

44
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.040
<v Speaker 1>You think this is important and it works cause your tribe's alive and you think</v>

45
00:01:41.041 --> 00:01:44.790
<v Speaker 1>this is important and it works because your tribe is alive and so we'll take the</v>

46
00:01:44.791 --> 00:01:47.970
<v Speaker 1>best of both if we could manage it and extract,</v>

47
00:01:47.971 --> 00:01:51.480
<v Speaker 1>extract out something that's even more abstract that covers both of us.</v>

48
00:01:51.481 --> 00:01:52.410
<v Speaker 1>If we can do it.</v>

49
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.230
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that's really interesting about Marduk,</v>

50
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.840
<v Speaker 1>I'll just give you a couple of of his features,</v>

51
00:01:57.841 --> 00:02:00.780
<v Speaker 1>but he has eyes all the way around his head.</v>

52
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.510
<v Speaker 1>He's elected by all the other gods to be King God.</v>

53
00:02:03.511 --> 00:02:05.400
<v Speaker 1>So that's the first thing that's quite cool.</v>

54
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.200
<v Speaker 1>And they elect him because they're,</v>

55
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.970
<v Speaker 1>they're facing a terrible threat,</v>

56
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.370
<v Speaker 1>sort of like a flood and a monster combined,</v>

57
00:02:11.371 --> 00:02:12.181
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

58
00:02:12.181 --> 00:02:15.630
<v Speaker 1>And martech basically says that if they elect him talk God,</v>

59
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.350
<v Speaker 1>then he'll go out and stop the flood monster and,</v>

60
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.910
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

61
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.520
<v Speaker 1>and they won't all get wiped out.</v>

62
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.570
<v Speaker 1>It's a serious threat.</v>

63
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.890
<v Speaker 1>It's chaos itself,</v>

64
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.540
<v Speaker 1>making its comeback.</v>

65
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.680
<v Speaker 1>And so all the Gods agree and Marta has a new manifestation.</v>

66
00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:32.310
<v Speaker 1>He's got eyes all the way around his head and he speaks magic words.</v>

67
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.130
<v Speaker 1>And then he also goes out and when he fights,</v>

68
00:02:35.131 --> 00:02:37.110
<v Speaker 1>he fights this daddy called Taya Mat.</v>

69
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.820
<v Speaker 1>And we need to know that because the word tie Matt is associated with the word</v>

70
00:02:41.821 --> 00:02:42.654
<v Speaker 1>take home.</v>

71
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.870
<v Speaker 1>T h o m and tail is the chaos that God makes order out of at the beginning of</v>

72
00:02:48.181 --> 00:02:49.800
<v Speaker 1>time in genesis.</v>

73
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.510
<v Speaker 1>So it's linked very tightly to this story and Martech with his eyes and his</v>

74
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:55.470
<v Speaker 1>capacity to speak.</v>

75
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.690
<v Speaker 1>Magic words goes out to confront tie Amat Matt,</v>

76
00:02:57.691 --> 00:03:00.880
<v Speaker 1>who's like a watery see drag and something like that.</v>

77
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:02.800
<v Speaker 1>It's a classic.</v>

78
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.180
<v Speaker 1>It's a classic St George Story.</v>

79
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.740
<v Speaker 1>Go out and wreak havoc on the dragon.</v>

80
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.790
<v Speaker 1>He cuts her into pieces and he makes the world out of her pieces.</v>

81
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.650
<v Speaker 1>And that's the world that human beings live in.</v>

82
00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:17.800
<v Speaker 1>And the Mesopotamian emperor acted out Marduk.</v>

83
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:20.680
<v Speaker 1>He was allowed to be emperor in so far as he was a good Marduk.</v>

84
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.800
<v Speaker 1>And so that meant that he had eyes all the way around his head and he could</v>

85
00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:25.000
<v Speaker 1>speak magic,</v>

86
00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:26.590
<v Speaker 1>he could speak properly.</v>

87
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.680
<v Speaker 1>And so that we're starting to understand they're at that point,</v>

88
00:03:29.681 --> 00:03:30.910
<v Speaker 1>the essence of leadership,</v>

89
00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:31.181
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

90
00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:32.410
<v Speaker 1>Because what's leadership?</v>

91
00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:36.340
<v Speaker 1>It's the capacity to see what the hell is in front of your face and maybe in</v>

92
00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:40.150
<v Speaker 1>every direction and then the capacity to use your language properly in a</v>

93
00:03:40.151 --> 00:03:43.780
<v Speaker 1>transformative manner and to transform chaos into order.</v>

94
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.520
<v Speaker 1>And God only know how those,</v>

95
00:03:45.521 --> 00:03:47.950
<v Speaker 1>how long it took the Mesopotamians to figure that out.</v>

96
00:03:47.951 --> 00:03:50.200
<v Speaker 1>And the best they could do is dramatize it,</v>

97
00:03:50.201 --> 00:03:52.660
<v Speaker 1>but it's staggeringly brilliant.</v>
