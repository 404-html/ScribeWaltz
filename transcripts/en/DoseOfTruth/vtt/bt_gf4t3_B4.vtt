1
00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:07.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.660
<v Speaker 1>So back to where you were saying before about the striving upwards towards</v>

3
00:00:11.661 --> 00:00:13.940
<v Speaker 1>something that happened up there,</v>

4
00:00:13.941 --> 00:00:14.930
<v Speaker 1>whatever that is.</v>

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.770
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

6
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.310
<v Speaker 1>of course we don't want to go for utopia because there's no such place to get to</v>

7
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.460
<v Speaker 1>and that causes catastrophes in history.</v>

8
00:00:22.461 --> 00:00:23.120
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

9
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.090
<v Speaker 1>but the idea of like,</v>

10
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.770
<v Speaker 1>of like making the world a more rational place,</v>

11
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.880
<v Speaker 1>this is a good goal.</v>

12
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.490
<v Speaker 1>And this is the kind of thing that we do at skeptic magazine.</v>

13
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:32.810
<v Speaker 1>I what did we do?</v>

14
00:00:32.811 --> 00:00:35.210
<v Speaker 1>We promote science and reason and critical thinking.</v>

15
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.950
<v Speaker 1>You write about critical thinking,</v>

16
00:00:36.951 --> 00:00:37.970
<v Speaker 1>this is what you do.</v>

17
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.060
<v Speaker 1>So we're all working on that and that and and that's good.</v>

18
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

19
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.180
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

20
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.200
<v Speaker 1>Well I'm always looking at,</v>

21
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.961
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

22
00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:45.794
<v Speaker 1>go ahead.</v>

23
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.160
<v Speaker 1>We'll be talking about literature for example.</v>

24
00:00:49.161 --> 00:00:53.800
<v Speaker 1>It's returned to the books of the Bible or dusty SD or if we want to make our</v>

25
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.280
<v Speaker 1>listeners' heads explode,</v>

26
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.050
<v Speaker 1>iron rand and atlas shrug.</v>

27
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.900
<v Speaker 1>Why have people by the tens of millions purchased her books?</v>

28
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.621
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

29
00:01:03.621 --> 00:01:05.000
<v Speaker 1>literary critics say they're awful,</v>

30
00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:05.541
<v Speaker 1>they're terrible.</v>

31
00:01:05.541 --> 00:01:08.840
<v Speaker 1>Novels are not well written and her figures are black and white and her</v>

32
00:01:08.841 --> 00:01:09.830
<v Speaker 1>philosophy is wrong.</v>

33
00:01:09.831 --> 00:01:10.430
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

34
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.851
<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>

35
00:01:10.851 --> 00:01:11.601
<v Speaker 1>you have to ask yourself,</v>

36
00:01:11.601 --> 00:01:14.090
<v Speaker 1>why do tens of millions of people love those books?</v>

37
00:01:14.091 --> 00:01:14.750
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

38
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.380
<v Speaker 1>and it's because she's doing something else.</v>

39
00:01:17.381 --> 00:01:20.210
<v Speaker 1>He's not trying to describe the world the way it actually is,</v>

40
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.410
<v Speaker 1>but that the way it could be.</v>

41
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.810
<v Speaker 1>And these are the things we've done wrong.</v>

42
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:24.441
<v Speaker 1>Communism,</v>

43
00:01:24.441 --> 00:01:25.011
<v Speaker 1>socialism,</v>

44
00:01:25.011 --> 00:01:27.350
<v Speaker 1>because she came out of that Russian background.</v>

45
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.260
<v Speaker 1>And so her figures like John Golf,</v>

46
00:01:30.261 --> 00:01:32.910
<v Speaker 1>these are kind of ideal things to strive for.</v>

47
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.461
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

48
00:01:33.461 --> 00:01:34.294
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

49
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.990
<v Speaker 2>Her fingers are archetypal heroes of a certain form.</v>

50
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.380
<v Speaker 1>If we could bring it back to some real world example,</v>

51
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.370
<v Speaker 1>I just recently,</v>

52
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.190
<v Speaker 1>recently started following a Jocko Willink feel,</v>

53
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:47.870
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

54
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm never going to be Jocko Willink,</v>

55
00:01:49.361 --> 00:01:50.081
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

56
00:01:50.081 --> 00:01:53.410
<v Speaker 1>I got this book and I read one page a day and it,</v>

57
00:01:53.411 --> 00:01:53.621
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

58
00:01:53.621 --> 00:01:54.170
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of,</v>

59
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.780
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of like,</v>

60
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.613
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

61
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.170
<v Speaker 1>you can get up at six in the morning and get out there on your bike ride with</v>

62
00:01:59.171 --> 00:01:59.830
<v Speaker 1>the guys.</v>

63
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:00.641
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do it.</v>

64
00:02:00.641 --> 00:02:04.210
<v Speaker 1>But then I see his page and he's just get at it.</v>

65
00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:05.240
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

66
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.100
<v Speaker 1>So in a way,</v>

67
00:02:06.101 --> 00:02:08.530
<v Speaker 1>it's not describing the world in a scientific way.</v>

68
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.120
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

69
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.500
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

70
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.260
<v Speaker 1>it's sending a different message,</v>

71
00:02:11.261 --> 00:02:13.870
<v Speaker 1>like you should strive to be this,</v>

72
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:14.860
<v Speaker 1>even if you don't make it,</v>

73
00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.993
<v Speaker 1>just do it.</v>

74
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.871
<v Speaker 1>Do something.</v>

75
00:02:16.871 --> 00:02:17.704
<v Speaker 1>Anything.</v>

76
00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.530
<v Speaker 1>And that's a different sense of different goal.</v>

77
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:21.081
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

78
00:02:21.081 --> 00:02:21.370
<v Speaker 2>Well I,</v>

79
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.590
<v Speaker 2>I think to that.</v>

80
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.701
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

81
00:02:23.701 --> 00:02:24.421
<v Speaker 2>So first of all,</v>

82
00:02:24.421 --> 00:02:25.670
<v Speaker 2>with regards to any round,</v>

83
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.010
<v Speaker 2>I think the criticism leveled at her that her characters are too black and white</v>

84
00:02:29.011 --> 00:02:29.730
<v Speaker 2>is correct.</v>

85
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.810
<v Speaker 2>Because I think that one of the things that distinguishes great literature from</v>

86
00:02:33.811 --> 00:02:36.690
<v Speaker 2>propaganda is that in great literature,</v>

87
00:02:36.691 --> 00:02:39.450
<v Speaker 2>most of the conflict is within rather than between.</v>

88
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.831
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

89
00:02:40.831 --> 00:02:41.251
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

90
00:02:41.251 --> 00:02:44.910
<v Speaker 2>and the problem with the round is all her good characters are the same good</v>

91
00:02:44.911 --> 00:02:48.240
<v Speaker 2>character and all her bad characters are the same bad character.</v>

92
00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.810
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

93
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.310
<v Speaker 2>and there's no overlap between them.</v>

94
00:02:50.311 --> 00:02:51.420
<v Speaker 2>So there's a curiosity,</v>

95
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.130
<v Speaker 2>there's an architectural purity,</v>

96
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.460
<v Speaker 2>but that compromises its utility as literature.</v>

97
00:02:56.461 --> 00:02:57.294
<v Speaker 2>I would say</v>

98
00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.520
<v Speaker 1>Soltra Neeson makes his point in archipelago where he says,</v>

99
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.140
<v Speaker 1>if only the world,</v>

100
00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:04.870
<v Speaker 1>we're simply black and white and we can take the bad people and,</v>

101
00:03:04.871 --> 00:03:05.031
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

102
00:03:05.031 --> 00:03:06.430
<v Speaker 1>and isolate them somewhere.</v>

103
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:07.481
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is,</v>

104
00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:07.810
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

105
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:08.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

106
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.640
<v Speaker 1>we all have a darkness and evil in our hearts</v>

107
00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.500
<v Speaker 2>between good and evil runs down every hard doubts,</v>

108
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:15.570
<v Speaker 2>his famous sprays.</v>

109
00:03:15.571 --> 00:03:18.090
<v Speaker 2>And it was something he experienced very deeply and is also,</v>

110
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

111
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.260
<v Speaker 2>it's also pride,</v>

112
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.960
<v Speaker 2>primordial Lee true.</v>

113
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.890
<v Speaker 2>Whenever.</v>

114
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:23.723
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>

115
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.960
<v Speaker 1>Just analyze literature in this sense.</v>

116
00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:26.101
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

117
00:03:26.101 --> 00:03:27.210
<v Speaker 1>there's a body of literature,</v>

118
00:03:27.211 --> 00:03:27.980
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary,</v>

119
00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:28.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

120
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.720
<v Speaker 1>literary analysis in which,</v>

121
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.920
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

122
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:32.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

123
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.270
<v Speaker 1>peep pinker writes about this at the end of the blank slate in which he talks</v>

124
00:03:36.271 --> 00:03:37.070
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

125
00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.903
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

126
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.300
<v Speaker 1>these novels,</v>

127
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.650
<v Speaker 1>these sophisticated novels,</v>

128
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.300
<v Speaker 1>which the characters are rich and deep,</v>

129
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.811
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

130
00:03:42.811 --> 00:03:45.680
<v Speaker 1>they have all these good characters and bad characters,</v>

131
00:03:45.681 --> 00:03:46.830
<v Speaker 1>characteristics and so on.</v>

132
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.390
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

133
00:03:48.391 --> 00:03:49.200
<v Speaker 1>and we can,</v>

134
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.500
<v Speaker 1>we can glean from that in a sense that the novelists we're ahead of the</v>

135
00:03:52.501 --> 00:03:52.921
<v Speaker 1>cognitive.</v>

136
00:03:52.921 --> 00:03:53.754
<v Speaker 1>This is his point.</v>

137
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.760
<v Speaker 1>The novelists we're about a century ahead of the cognitive scientists and</v>

138
00:03:56.761 --> 00:04:01.761
<v Speaker 1>thinking that you're going to have human nature or maybe a thousand years ahead</v>

139
00:04:01.921 --> 00:04:02.754
<v Speaker 1>of</v>

140
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.070
<v Speaker 1>modern literature anyway,</v>

141
00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

142
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.930
<v Speaker 1>so we can,</v>

143
00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.200
<v Speaker 1>we can gain a lot from that.</v>

144
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.400
<v Speaker 1>Not just the rich emotional experience of reading a good novel.</v>

145
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.090
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

146
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.570
<v Speaker 1>but actually teasing out this is what some of these evolutionary literary people</v>

147
00:04:15.571 --> 00:04:16.111
<v Speaker 1>are trying to do.</v>

148
00:04:16.111 --> 00:04:19.470
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's certain themes that come up over and over and over again.</v>

149
00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:20.190
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

150
00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.570
<v Speaker 1>it's not totally random.</v>

151
00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.620
<v Speaker 1>Unlike the postmodernists there,</v>

152
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.370
<v Speaker 1>there actually are a certain real meanings that the author intended and there</v>

153
00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:30.290
<v Speaker 1>problem</v>

154
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.561
<v Speaker 2>c,</v>

155
00:04:30.561 --> 00:04:33.530
<v Speaker 2>I think the problem with the postmodernists technically speaking,</v>

156
00:04:33.531 --> 00:04:34.730
<v Speaker 2>and I've thought a lot about this,</v>

157
00:04:34.731 --> 00:04:37.670
<v Speaker 2>is that they got their initial criticism right,</v>

158
00:04:37.671 --> 00:04:41.270
<v Speaker 2>which is that there's an infinite number of ways of interpreting a finite set of</v>

159
00:04:41.271 --> 00:04:42.104
<v Speaker 2>phenomenon,</v>

160
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.610
<v Speaker 2>but there isn't an,</v>

161
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:44.563
<v Speaker 2>there isn't an,</v>

162
00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.250
<v Speaker 2>there isn't an infinite number of valid ways of interpreting a finite set of</v>

163
00:04:49.251 --> 00:04:50.084
<v Speaker 2>phenomena.</v>

164
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.040
<v Speaker 2>And that's where you get right back into the issue of the circulation of the</v>

165
00:04:55.041 --> 00:04:58.670
<v Speaker 2>interpretation around these great underlying architectural themes.</v>

166
00:04:58.671 --> 00:05:01.670
<v Speaker 2>And then our belt in large part right into our biology,</v>

167
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.490
<v Speaker 2>I read a really interesting analysis of the,</v>

168
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:05.623
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

169
00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.880
<v Speaker 2>of the symbol of the dragon awhile back.</v>

170
00:05:07.881 --> 00:05:10.850
<v Speaker 2>And I can't conjure up the name of the book unfortunately,</v>

171
00:05:10.851 --> 00:05:12.950
<v Speaker 2>but his hypothesis,</v>

172
00:05:12.951 --> 00:05:14.270
<v Speaker 2>which I thought was a very good one,</v>

173
00:05:14.271 --> 00:05:15.104
<v Speaker 2>was that,</v>

174
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:16.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

175
00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:17.900
<v Speaker 2>a dragon is a Metta Predator.</v>

176
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.310
<v Speaker 2>So it's the symbol for Predator and,</v>

177
00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.480
<v Speaker 2>but it's more than that.</v>

178
00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.400
<v Speaker 2>But the Predator is treat cat,</v>

179
00:05:25.401 --> 00:05:26.300
<v Speaker 2>snake bird,</v>

180
00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.030
<v Speaker 2>because the fundamental predators of tree dwelling primates where cats,</v>

181
00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.530
<v Speaker 2>snakes and birds.</v>

182
00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.100
<v Speaker 2>And so what it is is an amalgam of all those things.</v>

183
00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:38.600
<v Speaker 2>And so it's real,</v>

184
00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.090
<v Speaker 2>just like the category of Predator is real,</v>

185
00:05:41.091 --> 00:05:44.720
<v Speaker 2>even though snakes and cats are both in the category of Predator and no one</v>

186
00:05:44.721 --> 00:05:44.961
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

187
00:05:44.961 --> 00:05:45.111
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

188
00:05:45.111 --> 00:05:46.760
<v Speaker 2>there's no such thing as a predator.</v>

189
00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.030
<v Speaker 2>And then you can add fire to that for a variety of reasons,</v>

190
00:05:50.031 --> 00:05:51.660
<v Speaker 2>not least being uh,</v>

191
00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:53.800
<v Speaker 2>being I'm sure that fire white belt,</v>

192
00:05:53.801 --> 00:05:55.490
<v Speaker 2>many of our ancestors as well.</v>

193
00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:56.810
<v Speaker 2>And then the additional,</v>

194
00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.810
<v Speaker 2>which is the dragon's also hoard gold.</v>

195
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.400
<v Speaker 2>So human beings,</v>

196
00:06:01.401 --> 00:06:02.540
<v Speaker 2>because we're not just prey,</v>

197
00:06:02.541 --> 00:06:05.150
<v Speaker 2>animals learned that if we confronted the Metta Predator,</v>

198
00:06:05.151 --> 00:06:06.920
<v Speaker 2>we would gain as a consequence.</v>

199
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:13.460
<v Speaker 2>There are certain channels down which good stories go based on our biological</v>

200
00:06:13.461 --> 00:06:14.930
<v Speaker 2>nature or evolved in nature.</v>

201
00:06:14.931 --> 00:06:17.180
<v Speaker 2>It's not that it's completely deterministic in that sense.</v>

202
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.750
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

203
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:17.930
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

204
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.370
<v Speaker 2>It's variations on a theme,</v>

205
00:06:19.371 --> 00:06:19.910
<v Speaker 2>I would say.</v>
