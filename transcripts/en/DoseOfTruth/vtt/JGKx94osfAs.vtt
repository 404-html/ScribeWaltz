1
00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.520
<v Speaker 1>So the burrito distribution governs all sorts of other things too.</v>

2
00:00:10.521 --> 00:00:11.354
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned</v>

3
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.050
<v Speaker 1>it governs the popularity of box,</v>

4
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:16.130
<v Speaker 1>the sales of books,</v>

5
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.360
<v Speaker 1>but it also,</v>

6
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.870
<v Speaker 1>it also characterizes the distribution of everything that people produce.</v>

7
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.790
<v Speaker 1>So if you think of creative production of any sort of artistic production,</v>

8
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.020
<v Speaker 1>industrial production,</v>

9
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:31.123
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>

10
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.400
<v Speaker 1>Almost everything fails</v>

11
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.340
<v Speaker 1>and a few things succeed beyond anyone's wildest imagination.</v>

12
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.230
<v Speaker 1>Apple's a good example of that.</v>

13
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.711
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

14
00:00:43.711 --> 00:00:45.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean the iPhone,</v>

15
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.220
<v Speaker 1>they have their competitors,</v>

16
00:00:47.221 --> 00:00:51.720
<v Speaker 1>but it's an extraordinarily dominant product and they rake in billions of</v>

17
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.721
<v Speaker 1>dollars,</v>

18
00:00:51.721 --> 00:00:52.554
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

19
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if apple is valued at $1 trillion,</v>

20
00:00:55.441 --> 00:00:57.600
<v Speaker 1>but it's close to that.</v>

21
00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.610
<v Speaker 1>And that's a lot of money.</v>

22
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.211
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

23
00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:01.320
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>

24
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.240
<v Speaker 1>it's something like this.</v>

25
00:01:03.241 --> 00:01:04.470
<v Speaker 1>I probably have the figures wrong,</v>

26
00:01:04.471 --> 00:01:06.150
<v Speaker 1>but like the top 40 people,</v>

27
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.810
<v Speaker 1>the richest 40 people in the world have as much money as the bottom 2 billion</v>

28
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:11.581
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

29
00:01:11.581 --> 00:01:11.821
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

30
00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:14.580
<v Speaker 1>it's not like they're stuffing their mattresses with that money,</v>

31
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.100
<v Speaker 1>or they have a skyscraper full of cash.</v>

32
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.780
<v Speaker 1>That money is out in the economy doing whatever money does.</v>

33
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.670
<v Speaker 1>So you know you can't spend $28 billion.</v>

34
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.780
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

35
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.730
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes you can even do some good with it.</v>

36
00:01:29.731 --> 00:01:30.001
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

37
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:33.930
<v Speaker 1>Bill Gates seems to be doing something reasonable with his money.</v>

38
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.310
<v Speaker 1>But the reason I'm telling you this is because one of the things you should know</v>

39
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.270
<v Speaker 1>is that this proclivity for inequality is pervasive among the creative products</v>

40
00:01:46.411 --> 00:01:47.280
<v Speaker 1>of human beings.</v>

41
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.550
<v Speaker 1>It's the case with with goals scored in hockey.</v>

42
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:51.930
<v Speaker 1>My son told me,</v>

43
00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.020
<v Speaker 1>and he's a reliable source on hockey statistics that,</v>

44
00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:56.610
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

45
00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.570
<v Speaker 1>if Wayne Gretzky,</v>

46
00:01:57.571 --> 00:02:02.571
<v Speaker 1>if you don't count any of the points that Wayne Gretzky managed with scoring is</v>

47
00:02:02.681 --> 00:02:06.330
<v Speaker 1>still had enough points just with assistance to have more points than any hockey</v>

48
00:02:06.331 --> 00:02:07.350
<v Speaker 1>player that ever played.</v>

49
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.750
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

50
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.790
<v Speaker 1>even at the upper end of,</v>

51
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.380
<v Speaker 1>of of the distribution,</v>

52
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.730
<v Speaker 1>there's some person who's Ha,</v>

53
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.040
<v Speaker 1>they're so good at what they do.</v>

54
00:02:17.041 --> 00:02:21.060
<v Speaker 1>And then there's another person that's so much better than them that it's not</v>

55
00:02:21.061 --> 00:02:22.140
<v Speaker 1>even comparable.</v>

56
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:23.543
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

57
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.300
<v Speaker 1>and the benefits flow to people who are in that position.</v>

58
00:02:27.301 --> 00:02:28.500
<v Speaker 1>And you can understand why.</v>

59
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.340
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

60
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.920
<v Speaker 1>because I know,</v>

61
00:02:30.921 --> 00:02:35.921
<v Speaker 1>let's say you start writing and you get a book and a rare things,</v>

62
00:02:36.571 --> 00:02:38.010
<v Speaker 1>very weird things to have happened.</v>

63
00:02:38.011 --> 00:02:39.660
<v Speaker 1>And then some people read it and they like it.</v>

64
00:02:39.661 --> 00:02:42.630
<v Speaker 1>And then of course it's much more likely that you'll get a next book.</v>

65
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.160
<v Speaker 1>And if people like that,</v>

66
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.440
<v Speaker 1>while it's even more likely that you'll get a third book,</v>

67
00:02:46.441 --> 00:02:48.000
<v Speaker 1>and then people start to know who you are,</v>

68
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:49.680
<v Speaker 1>and then because they know who you are,</v>

69
00:02:49.681 --> 00:02:52.770
<v Speaker 1>they phone you up on offer you opportunities and your network grows.</v>

70
00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:57.771
<v Speaker 1>And it's like this exponential increase in your reach and your capacity for</v>

71
00:02:58.981 --> 00:03:02.400
<v Speaker 1>production and more and more flows to you.</v>
