1
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.750
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

2
00:00:07.751 --> 00:00:11.710
<v Speaker 1>so the individual as like culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like nature also has its negative</v>

3
00:00:11.711 --> 00:00:14.110
<v Speaker 1>element.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would call that the shadow.</v>

4
00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:15.370
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're going to,</v>

5
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.970
<v Speaker 1>we're going to discuss the shadow in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some detail because one of the things</v>

6
00:00:18.971 --> 00:00:23.971
<v Speaker 1>that you believed and he kind of got</v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea from nature was that when you</v>

7
00:00:24.611 --> 00:00:27.250
<v Speaker 1>grow up and maybe as a consequence of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your temperament,</v>

8
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.610
<v Speaker 1>you tend to think that some of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>attributes are good and some of them are</v>

9
00:00:30.611 --> 00:00:31.510
<v Speaker 1>negative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.790
<v Speaker 1>so you make moral judgments about them</v>
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

11
00:00:33.791 --> 00:00:34.990
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

12
00:00:34.991 --> 00:00:39.991
<v Speaker 1>you might think for the psychoanalysts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two elements of human being that</v>

13
00:00:40.361 --> 00:00:45.361
<v Speaker 1>we're commonly regarded as negative from</v>
<v Speaker 1>a moral perspective or sexuality and</v>

14
00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:49.150
<v Speaker 1>aggression and but yoga of notion is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

15
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.871
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:49.871 --> 00:00:54.550
<v Speaker 1>you might be someone who's modest and</v>
<v Speaker 1>careful and never causes any conflict.</v>

17
00:00:54.551 --> 00:00:57.190
<v Speaker 1>And then we might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you're a well socialized person,</v>

18
00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:58.630
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his point would be,</v>

19
00:00:58.631 --> 00:01:00.040
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've got no power,</v>

20
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.360
<v Speaker 1>you've got no power.</v>

21
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.790
<v Speaker 1>And so people are just going to roll</v>
<v Speaker 1>right over you.</v>

22
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.470
<v Speaker 1>So you better dive into that morass of</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexuality and aggression and pull out</v>

23
00:01:08.471 --> 00:01:12.160
<v Speaker 1>those powers and integrate them into</v>
<v Speaker 1>your psyche so that you can use them</v>

24
00:01:12.161 --> 00:01:14.200
<v Speaker 1>consciously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because without that,</v>

25
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.800
<v Speaker 1>you're harmless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

26
00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's a very good</v>
<v Speaker 1>ambition.</v>

27
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.080
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you want to be when you're 30</v>

28
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.430
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be harmless.</v>

29
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.140
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

30
00:01:23.141 --> 00:01:26.050
<v Speaker 1>really that's what you want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you might as well not even be</v>

31
00:01:26.051 --> 00:01:28.240
<v Speaker 1>if that's your goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

32
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.180
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this dichotomy between the positive</v>

33
00:01:31.181 --> 00:01:32.980
<v Speaker 1>individual and the negative individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

34
00:01:32.981 --> 00:01:37.180
<v Speaker 1>very complex because what's positive and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's negative is not obvious from the</v>

35
00:01:37.181 --> 00:01:40.300
<v Speaker 1>beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And arbitrary judgments don't help.</v>

36
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.930
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult for a given</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual to look at themselves and</v>

37
00:01:43.931 --> 00:01:44.890
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

38
00:01:44.891 --> 00:01:48.100
<v Speaker 1>what is it about me that's actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>worth developing?</v>

39
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.360
<v Speaker 1>And I can tie this into some degree and</v>
<v Speaker 1>to big five theories.</v>

40
00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:54.370
<v Speaker 1>So one of the big five characteristics</v>
<v Speaker 1>is</v>

41
00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.520
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people tend to think of</v>

42
00:02:00.521 --> 00:02:02.470
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness has a virtue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a complete,</v>

43
00:02:02.471 --> 00:02:06.340
<v Speaker 1>it's completely idiotic to think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>because every virtue has its vice.</v>

44
00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.610
<v Speaker 1>But agreeable people are sympathetic and</v>
<v Speaker 1>empathetic.</v>

45
00:02:09.611 --> 00:02:12.340
<v Speaker 1>And Compassionate and polite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those all sound like good things.</v>

46
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.460
<v Speaker 1>But they're also part of being an e</v>
<v Speaker 1>DePaul parent by the way.</v>

47
00:02:15.461 --> 00:02:16.750
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>

48
00:02:16.751 --> 00:02:20.470
<v Speaker 1>the problem with being agreeable is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people take advantage of you and then</v>

49
00:02:20.471 --> 00:02:23.950
<v Speaker 1>you get resentful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm sure there's a whole pile of you</v>

50
00:02:23.951 --> 00:02:25.690
<v Speaker 1>in here that are agreeable and</v>
<v Speaker 1>resentful.</v>

51
00:02:25.691 --> 00:02:27.430
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you know who you are.</v>

52
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.370
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I would mention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you should think about this cause</v>

53
00:02:30.371 --> 00:02:34.150
<v Speaker 1>it'll help you a lot if you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that resentment is your best friend.</v>

54
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.830
<v Speaker 1>If something makes you resentful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do not do it.</v>

55
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.410
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or there's a more sophisticated rule,</v>

56
00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:43.660
<v Speaker 1>which is if something makes you</v>
<v Speaker 1>resentful,</v>

57
00:02:43.661 --> 00:02:47.140
<v Speaker 1>there's only two possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is that you're sniffling and</v>

58
00:02:47.141 --> 00:02:50.110
<v Speaker 1>immature and you won't adopt your</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities and you're whining</v>

59
00:02:50.111 --> 00:02:52.810
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other is that you're being pushed</v>

60
00:02:52.811 --> 00:02:55.000
<v Speaker 1>around and people are attempting to</v>
<v Speaker 1>enslave you.</v>

61
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.810
<v Speaker 1>So you want to eliminate the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility,</v>

62
00:02:58.811 --> 00:02:59.650
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got To think,</v>

63
00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:01.540
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>am I just being immature and whining</v>

64
00:03:01.541 --> 00:03:04.090
<v Speaker 1>about this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it something that people are</v>

65
00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:07.900
<v Speaker 1>reasonably demanding of me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you think that through and maybe</v>

66
00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:09.370
<v Speaker 1>you talked to some people about it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

67
00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:09.700
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

68
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.510
<v Speaker 1>this isn't reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the resentment is telling you act,</v>

69
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.570
<v Speaker 1>act because otherwise that's what you'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

70
00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:19.810
<v Speaker 1>You'll end up 15 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're married or</v>

71
00:03:19.811 --> 00:03:23.860
<v Speaker 1>something like that with 8,000 things</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're resentful about and then you know</v>

72
00:03:23.861 --> 00:03:26.680
<v Speaker 1>you'll be in some kind of painful</v>
<v Speaker 1>divorce that lasts for 10 years.</v>

73
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.000
<v Speaker 1>So better to nip it in the bud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone is after you to do something</v>

74
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.230
<v Speaker 1>and you don't feel like you're getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>proper regard or proper response or you</v>

75
00:03:35.231 --> 00:03:40.231
<v Speaker 1>don't think it's fair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like have some courage and get a</v>

76
00:03:40.741 --> 00:03:43.810
<v Speaker 1>hold of your anger and use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean you're right,</v>

77
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.960
<v Speaker 1>but at least it means you can push the</v>
<v Speaker 1>person hard enough so they have to</v>

78
00:03:46.961 --> 00:03:50.200
<v Speaker 1>engage in a dialogue with you and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know this is,</v>

79
00:03:50.201 --> 00:03:53.140
<v Speaker 1>these are necessary skills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you cannot do this,</v>

80
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.390
<v Speaker 1>you have to be able to say no to</v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiate.</v>

81
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.360
<v Speaker 1>You have to be able to say no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you always want to put yourself in a</v>

82
00:03:58.361 --> 00:04:00.940
<v Speaker 1>position where you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of being,</v>

83
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.150
<v Speaker 1>that's part of power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing is do not let people</v>

84
00:04:04.151 --> 00:04:07.210
<v Speaker 1>push you around because you'll get</v>
<v Speaker 1>pushed right into a corner and you'll</v>

85
00:04:07.211 --> 00:04:10.480
<v Speaker 1>end up as a slave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's because there's tyranny,</v>

86
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.190
<v Speaker 1>slavery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or negotiation.</v>

87
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:13.600
<v Speaker 1>That's what you've got.</v>
