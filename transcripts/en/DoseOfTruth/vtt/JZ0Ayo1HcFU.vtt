1
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.233
<v Speaker 1>Hm</v>

2
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.060
<v Speaker 1>consciousness kind of overrides the concept of time at the beginning and then</v>

3
00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.120
<v Speaker 1>your consciousness just returns to where it was and that the physical body and</v>

4
00:00:19.121 --> 00:00:23.910
<v Speaker 1>brave is just a temporary instantiation of consciousness in the physical bead.</v>

5
00:00:23.911 --> 00:00:28.090
<v Speaker 1>But this goes back to some other place and then there's like a figure,</v>

6
00:00:28.091 --> 00:00:30.850
<v Speaker 1>we don't have the words to even conceive of what that means.</v>

7
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.520
<v Speaker 1>And that is that the western language,</v>

8
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:34.760
<v Speaker 1>the way science is taught,</v>

9
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.860
<v Speaker 1>I can't really capture what he's talking about it in that sense.</v>

10
00:00:38.861 --> 00:00:43.861
<v Speaker 1>And so that's why I think we kind of hit an epistemological wall there where you</v>

11
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.960
<v Speaker 1>have to actually get into introspection,</v>

12
00:00:46.961 --> 00:00:47.830
<v Speaker 1>meditation,</v>

13
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.630
<v Speaker 1>and that the deeper parts of that tradition that I've never been able to really</v>

14
00:00:52.631 --> 00:00:53.650
<v Speaker 1>get into personally.</v>

15
00:00:53.651 --> 00:00:55.480
<v Speaker 1>So I can't say I understand it,</v>

16
00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.410
<v Speaker 1>although I kind of see where he's coming from in that regard.</v>

17
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.210
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

18
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.340
<v Speaker 2>so let me ask you some questions about that.</v>

19
00:01:02.341 --> 00:01:07.341
<v Speaker 2>So the first might have to do with this idea of the ontological primacy of</v>

20
00:01:07.891 --> 00:01:08.730
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>

21
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:10.140
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

22
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.980
<v Speaker 2>One of the things I've learned from studying mythology is that the mythological</v>

23
00:01:13.981 --> 00:01:14.551
<v Speaker 2>worldview,</v>

24
00:01:14.551 --> 00:01:14.971
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

25
00:01:14.971 --> 00:01:19.560
<v Speaker 2>I think the mythological worldview conceptualizes the world as a place to act</v>

26
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.900
<v Speaker 2>rather than as a place of things.</v>

27
00:01:21.901 --> 00:01:23.670
<v Speaker 2>So it's sort of like Steven Jig,</v>

28
00:01:23.671 --> 00:01:27.120
<v Speaker 2>Jay Gould's idea of two magistarium don't overlap.</v>

29
00:01:27.121 --> 00:01:30.600
<v Speaker 2>There's a moral magistarium materialist magistarium say,</v>

30
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.850
<v Speaker 2>but it's been striking to me,</v>

31
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.280
<v Speaker 2>looking at the archetype will foundations of mythological thinking that,</v>

32
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.850
<v Speaker 2>that in the scientific world view,</v>

33
00:01:38.851 --> 00:01:41.970
<v Speaker 2>there seem to be two fundamental causal elements.</v>

34
00:01:41.971 --> 00:01:43.490
<v Speaker 2>You could say nature and nurture,</v>

35
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.400
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>

36
00:01:44.401 --> 00:01:46.260
<v Speaker 2>or biology and society.</v>

37
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.530
<v Speaker 2>And then technically sophisticated western academics argue about the relative</v>

38
00:01:52.621 --> 00:01:54.720
<v Speaker 2>contribution of each to any given,</v>

39
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

40
00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.940
<v Speaker 2>existential phenomenon.</v>

41
00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.470
<v Speaker 2>But in the mythological worldview,</v>

42
00:01:58.471 --> 00:02:00.000
<v Speaker 2>there's always three actors.</v>

43
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.230
<v Speaker 2>There is nature.</v>

44
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.400
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

45
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.790
<v Speaker 2>usually personified as female or experienced is female,</v>

46
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.830
<v Speaker 2>cause personified isn't quite the right word.</v>

47
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.993
<v Speaker 2>There's culture,</v>

48
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:13.170
<v Speaker 2>but there's also the individual and the individual seems to be the same thing as</v>

49
00:02:13.171 --> 00:02:14.040
<v Speaker 2>the conscious actor.</v>

50
00:02:14.041 --> 00:02:17.120
<v Speaker 2>And that would be the hero of the dragon slaying hero saves.</v>

51
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.770
<v Speaker 2>And there's that,</v>

52
00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:21.510
<v Speaker 2>there is a kind of primacy given to that.</v>

53
00:02:21.511 --> 00:02:23.280
<v Speaker 2>And so in the oldest creation myths,</v>

54
00:02:23.281 --> 00:02:27.120
<v Speaker 2>you always see this interplay between the mother,</v>

55
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.980
<v Speaker 2>often mother earth and the father that the sky and then the hero who separates</v>

56
00:02:31.981 --> 00:02:33.300
<v Speaker 2>the two and somehow bring,</v>

57
00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.430
<v Speaker 2>and perversely in some sense,</v>

58
00:02:35.431 --> 00:02:40.431
<v Speaker 2>although being their product clearly as the offspring is also the thing that</v>

59
00:02:40.471 --> 00:02:42.120
<v Speaker 2>gives rise to them at the same,</v>

60
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.680
<v Speaker 2>at the same time.</v>

61
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.300
<v Speaker 2>And it seems to be something that's in keeping in some sense with our lived</v>

62
00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:52.350
<v Speaker 2>experiences that we confront the social world obviously,</v>

63
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.500
<v Speaker 2>and our beneficiaries and victims of it.</v>

64
00:02:55.501 --> 00:02:58.860
<v Speaker 2>And we confront the natural world in the same matter.</v>

65
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.020
<v Speaker 2>But we also seem to be a agentic actors and without us as a gender doctors,</v>

66
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.300
<v Speaker 2>the idea that there's a reality seems to,</v>

67
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.190
<v Speaker 2>it seems to be full of paradoxical holes like reality without a conscious actor.</v>

68
00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:13.540
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's the sort of thing that,</v>

69
00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.650
<v Speaker 2>that generates the thinking that you referred to as characteristic of,</v>

70
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.660
<v Speaker 2>of Deepak Chopra and the people who,</v>

71
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.430
<v Speaker 2>who make those sorts of claims.</v>

72
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:22.803
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

73
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.063
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

74
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.470
<v Speaker 2>what's your,</v>

75
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.640
<v Speaker 2>what's your take on,</v>

76
00:03:27.641 --> 00:03:30.400
<v Speaker 2>on consciousness and its role in being?</v>

77
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:32.583
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

78
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.071
<v Speaker 1>the one,</v>

79
00:03:33.071 --> 00:03:34.360
<v Speaker 1>and it's everything because,</v>

80
00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:35.700
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

81
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.770
<v Speaker 1>it's what I tell what I tell deep,</v>

82
00:03:37.771 --> 00:03:39.520
<v Speaker 1>like what I write about in that chapter is that,</v>

83
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:40.480
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

84
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.110
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

85
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.880
<v Speaker 1>you're familiar with the anthropic principle.</v>

86
00:03:42.881 --> 00:03:44.080
<v Speaker 1>So I call this the,</v>

87
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.970
<v Speaker 1>that the week consciousness principle that,</v>

88
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.840
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

89
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.800
<v Speaker 1>without consciousness,</v>

90
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.450
<v Speaker 1>without consciousness,</v>

91
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.460
<v Speaker 1>nothing exists.</v>

92
00:03:50.461 --> 00:03:50.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

93
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:51.461
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the points.</v>

94
00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:52.790
<v Speaker 1>The book makes a,</v>

95
00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.940
<v Speaker 1>and for me and you personally,</v>

96
00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.830
<v Speaker 1>if we're dead or we're not conscious,</v>

97
00:03:56.831 --> 00:03:58.570
<v Speaker 1>the world doesn't exist for our brains.</v>

98
00:03:58.571 --> 00:03:59.404
<v Speaker 1>It's gone.</v>

99
00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.860
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

100
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:00.693
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing.</v>

101
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.023
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

102
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.320
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

103
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.220
<v Speaker 1>but he goes further than that.</v>

104
00:04:03.221 --> 00:04:03.491
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

105
00:04:03.491 --> 00:04:06.040
<v Speaker 1>this is what I call the strong consciousness principle.</v>

106
00:04:06.041 --> 00:04:08.530
<v Speaker 1>That that consciousness is required.</v>

107
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.150
<v Speaker 1>Our consciousness is required for material things to exist.</v>

108
00:04:12.151 --> 00:04:12.984
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

109
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.260
<v Speaker 1>and so there I have a discussion of what,</v>

110
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.110
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

111
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

112
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.200
<v Speaker 1>Donald Hoffman,</v>

113
00:04:17.201 --> 00:04:20.130
<v Speaker 1>the cognitive scientists at Uc Irvine Colosseum is,</v>

114
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.513
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

115
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:22.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

116
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.920
<v Speaker 1>interface perception theory.</v>

117
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:25.001
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

118
00:04:25.001 --> 00:04:26.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you're familiar with this,</v>

119
00:04:26.171 --> 00:04:27.610
<v Speaker 1>but his analogy is like,</v>

120
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

121
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.410
<v Speaker 1>your laptop screen here.</v>

122
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.630
<v Speaker 1>Then you'd have these icons on the screen.</v>

123
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.270
<v Speaker 1>They had like the little trashcan icon looks like a Trashcan,</v>

124
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.370
<v Speaker 1>but of course there's no trash.</v>

125
00:04:36.371 --> 00:04:37.204
<v Speaker 1>Get the Oakland,</v>

126
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:38.530
<v Speaker 1>the open your laptop,</v>

127
00:04:38.531 --> 00:04:39.520
<v Speaker 1>there's no can in there.</v>

128
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:40.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

129
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.110
<v Speaker 1>these are just kind of icons that represent something that we think of as a</v>

130
00:04:44.111 --> 00:04:44.860
<v Speaker 1>trashcan.</v>

131
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:45.430
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

132
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.263
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

133
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

134
00:04:46.511 --> 00:04:47.040
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

135
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.831
<v Speaker 1>gets to the problem of,</v>

136
00:04:47.831 --> 00:04:48.011
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

137
00:04:48.011 --> 00:04:49.150
<v Speaker 1>what it's like to be a bat.</v>

138
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:50.343
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

139
00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.930
<v Speaker 1>I can't know if like bolted on some,</v>

140
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.460
<v Speaker 1>some huge ears.</v>

141
00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:54.701
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

142
00:04:54.701 --> 00:04:58.690
<v Speaker 1>and I had an echo location system and the neural processes to process that</v>

143
00:04:58.691 --> 00:05:00.270
<v Speaker 1>information until,</v>

144
00:05:00.271 --> 00:05:02.440
<v Speaker 1>and I would have some sense of what it's like to be a vet,</v>

145
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.360
<v Speaker 1>but they had everything on to actually be a bad thing.</v>

146
00:05:06.361 --> 00:05:08.380
<v Speaker 1>And I would just be a bat and I wouldn't even be,</v>

147
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.230
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't even know I was a human wondering what it's like to be a fat.</v>

148
00:05:11.231 --> 00:05:11.371
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

149
00:05:11.371 --> 00:05:13.480
<v Speaker 1>So at some level we can't actually know,</v>

150
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.530
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

151
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.420
<v Speaker 1>you know what it's like to be something else.</v>

152
00:05:16.421 --> 00:05:17.254
<v Speaker 1>And so you,</v>

153
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.831
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

154
00:05:17.831 --> 00:05:20.440
<v Speaker 1>with Deepak and I and these kinds of traditions like that,</v>

155
00:05:20.441 --> 00:05:23.530
<v Speaker 1>we hit this system illogical wall of language.</v>

156
00:05:23.531 --> 00:05:25.900
<v Speaker 1>It's difficult to say what you mean by certain things.</v>
