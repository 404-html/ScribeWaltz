1
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:12.050
<v Speaker 1>So Jacob goes back to Israel and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrified even though it's been 14</v>

2
00:00:12.271 --> 00:00:14.370
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thinks maybe his hotheaded brother</v>

3
00:00:14.371 --> 00:00:17.730
<v Speaker 1>hasn't calmed down yet and he has good</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason to think that I would say</v>

4
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.740
<v Speaker 1>so he sends messengers to Isa who then</v>
<v Speaker 1>sets out with 400 men.</v>

5
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.770
<v Speaker 1>And so Jacob is not very happy with this</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole idea.</v>

6
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.730
<v Speaker 1>And he breaks his people into two bands</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that maybe half of them cannot be</v>

7
00:00:32.731 --> 00:00:36.030
<v Speaker 1>killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he takes from his large flocks</v>

8
00:00:36.031 --> 00:00:40.440
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of animals and a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>servants and he sends them out to meet.</v>

9
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.380
<v Speaker 1>He saw basically to say look I'm I'm a</v>
<v Speaker 1>jerk.</v>

10
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.880
<v Speaker 1>Sorry about the whole birthright thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And.</v>

11
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.440
<v Speaker 1>And here some animals and you know maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's the beginnings of of an</v>

12
00:00:54.451 --> 00:00:56.220
<v Speaker 1>apology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

13
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.750
<v Speaker 1>And so but he's not very convinced that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually going to work.</v>

14
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.530
<v Speaker 1>But he saw who actually turns out to</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps have matured in the interim.</v>

15
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.730
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps that's one way of thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

16
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.230
<v Speaker 1>Meet Jacob and says that just seeing him</v>
<v Speaker 1>is enough.</v>

17
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.530
<v Speaker 1>But Jacob insists that he takes the gift</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so accepts and which is probably a</v>

18
00:01:19.801 --> 00:01:24.801
<v Speaker 1>wise thing because even if you saw is</v>
<v Speaker 1>ninety five percent convinced that just</v>

19
00:01:25.261 --> 00:01:28.740
<v Speaker 1>seeing his brother is enough there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably five percent of them that still</v>

20
00:01:28.741 --> 00:01:32.580
<v Speaker 1>really not all that happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to be careful.</v>

21
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.900
<v Speaker 1>You know when you say that you forgive</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone because there might be a part of</v>

22
00:01:36.901 --> 00:01:40.380
<v Speaker 1>you that really doesn't that really need</v>
<v Speaker 1>something else before you can actually</v>

23
00:01:40.381 --> 00:01:45.381
<v Speaker 1>say OK look fight you know and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to fool yourself about that because</v>

24
00:01:46.011 --> 00:01:50.990
<v Speaker 1>that 5 percent that hasn't been</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely convinced will find its voice</v>

25
00:01:50.991 --> 00:01:55.370
<v Speaker 1>at some point and then maybe undermine</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole reconciliation process.</v>

26
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.060
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to think that you're any</v>
<v Speaker 1>better than you are any nicer than you</v>

27
00:01:59.061 --> 00:02:02.610
<v Speaker 1>are it's not helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you saw as smart.</v>

28
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.430
<v Speaker 1>I think so while Jacob smart to say no</v>
<v Speaker 1>no like thanks a lot but take the damn</v>

29
00:02:07.431 --> 00:02:12.431
<v Speaker 1>goats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Jacob and Esau a smart enough to</v>

30
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.640
<v Speaker 1>accept that and he might do that maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you know</v>

31
00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.780
<v Speaker 1>to please Jacob but also I think so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there really is the possibility of</v>

32
00:02:22.781 --> 00:02:26.470
<v Speaker 1>establishing peace because</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically the gift that's being</v>

33
00:02:26.471 --> 00:02:31.471
<v Speaker 1>offered is of sufficient magnitude to</v>
<v Speaker 1>erase the debt of the loss of the</v>

34
00:02:31.661 --> 00:02:34.080
<v Speaker 1>Birthright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that right it's it's</v>

35
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.980
<v Speaker 1>it's it's the payment of the real debt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

36
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.000
<v Speaker 1>Jesus said what I mean is that by all</v>
<v Speaker 1>this drove which I met and Jacob said</v>

37
00:02:46.001 --> 00:02:48.490
<v Speaker 1>these are to find grace in the sight of</v>
<v Speaker 1>my lord.</v>

38
00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.650
<v Speaker 1>And he so says I have enough brother</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep thou keep that that thou hast unto</v>

39
00:02:53.651 --> 00:02:58.651
<v Speaker 1>thyself</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Jacob said this is interesting</v>

40
00:03:03.961 --> 00:03:08.961
<v Speaker 1>statement I think no I pray you if I</v>
<v Speaker 1>have now found grace in nice sight take</v>

41
00:03:09.361 --> 00:03:14.361
<v Speaker 1>the present at my hand for therefore I</v>
<v Speaker 1>have seen thy face as though I had seen</v>

42
00:03:14.371 --> 00:03:17.160
<v Speaker 1>the face of God and now was pleased with</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

43
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.670
<v Speaker 1>And so that's so he's he's taking the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honourable judgment of his brother</v>

44
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.080
<v Speaker 1>because it is honorable because he saw</v>
<v Speaker 1>did get betrayed so he has a right to be</v>

45
00:03:28.081 --> 00:03:33.081
<v Speaker 1>standing in judgment and he equates that</v>
<v Speaker 1>judgment with with what would you say</v>

46
00:03:35.251 --> 00:03:40.251
<v Speaker 1>with the highest of virtues it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriate judgment and so he wants to</v>

47
00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.080
<v Speaker 1>make complete amends to ease so as if he</v>
<v Speaker 1>saw as a representative of the divine</v>

48
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.380
<v Speaker 1>element of justice and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's convincing to you so it's</v>

49
00:03:52.361 --> 00:03:56.200
<v Speaker 1>quite a thing to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that I need to be reconciled to</v>

50
00:03:56.201 --> 00:03:59.050
<v Speaker 1>you because that would simultaneously</v>
<v Speaker 1>reconcile me with God.</v>

51
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.080
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's crucial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is between us.</v>

52
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.860
<v Speaker 1>But it's there's a higher principle at</v>
<v Speaker 1>stake that's vital.</v>

53
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.920
<v Speaker 1>And I think that is the case with</v>
<v Speaker 1>betrayal that's very frequently the case</v>

54
00:04:08.921 --> 00:04:13.390
<v Speaker 1>because if you betray someone you really</v>
<v Speaker 1>have violated you've deeply violated</v>

55
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.640
<v Speaker 1>what can only be called a sacred trust.</v>

56
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.340
<v Speaker 1>It's the right terminology for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take it.</v>

57
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.200
<v Speaker 1>I pray the my blessing that is brought</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the because God has dealt graciously</v>

58
00:04:23.201 --> 00:04:28.201
<v Speaker 1>with me and because I have enough and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>urged him and he took it so you know</v>

59
00:04:28.871 --> 00:04:32.980
<v Speaker 1>this story seems to be something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well Jacob was</v>

60
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.260
<v Speaker 1>kind of an arrogant crooked deceitful</v>
<v Speaker 1>character maybe over impressed with his</v>

61
00:04:40.261 --> 00:04:43.170
<v Speaker 1>own ability he thought it was pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>amusing to pull.</v>

62
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.480
<v Speaker 1>A fast trick or two on his brother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he ran off which is not all that</v>

63
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.900
<v Speaker 1>brave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he got walloped a lot and</v>

64
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.410
<v Speaker 1>perhaps learned something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when he came back you know he</v>

65
00:04:55.411 --> 00:04:56.400
<v Speaker 1>was a different person.</v>

66
00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.940
<v Speaker 2>And so that's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a reasonable story.</v>

67
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:08.010
<v Speaker 2>And you know he he has to repent</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely of about what he did before</v>

68
00:05:10.541 --> 00:05:14.740
<v Speaker 2>he can rectify the situation properly</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's willing to do that.</v>

69
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.890
<v Speaker 1>So that's an interesting idea too</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's it's it's an early</v>

70
00:05:20.891 --> 00:05:25.891
<v Speaker 1>reflection of the idea that it is if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do something wrong in the past a that</v>

71
00:05:26.081 --> 00:05:27.610
<v Speaker 1>you can learn from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

72
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.630
<v Speaker 1>So that you're actually capable of</v>
<v Speaker 1>learning and b that you can set the.</v>

73
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.700
<v Speaker 1>Balance right in the present.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are very optimistic ideas you know</v>

74
00:05:36.701 --> 00:05:41.701
<v Speaker 1>because you might say well once you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>committed some sort of crime that's it</v>

75
00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.310
<v Speaker 1>there's no hope for you but that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty rough because the probability</v>

76
00:05:45.311 --> 00:05:49.960
<v Speaker 1>that you've done unethical things at</v>
<v Speaker 1>some point in your life is 100 percent.</v>

77
00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:55.290
<v Speaker 1>And so if there was no way of setting</v>
<v Speaker 1>the balance right after that then</v>

78
00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.280
<v Speaker 1>everybody would be doomed.</v>
