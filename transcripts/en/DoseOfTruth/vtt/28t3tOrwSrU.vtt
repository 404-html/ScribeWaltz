1
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.650
<v Speaker 1>So we had our panel discussion on the stifling of free speech and university</v>

2
00:00:10.651 --> 00:00:15.651
<v Speaker 1>campuses November 11 with doctor sad and doctor Mfa and it was a capacity crowd,</v>

3
00:00:17.821 --> 00:00:21.420
<v Speaker 1>1500 it was sold out and there was people that came from all over Canada and the</v>

4
00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:23.910
<v Speaker 1>u s even some people from Europe.</v>

5
00:00:23.911 --> 00:00:24.870
<v Speaker 1>Surprisingly.</v>

6
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.270
<v Speaker 1>And I guess you and I chatted about this before that I was really surprised at</v>

7
00:00:30.271 --> 00:00:35.271
<v Speaker 1>the absolute lack of any mainstream media coverage of an issue that is very</v>

8
00:00:36.151 --> 00:00:40.590
<v Speaker 1>important for our times and the fact that it was the largest such event held in</v>

9
00:00:40.591 --> 00:00:41.424
<v Speaker 1>Canada.</v>

10
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.680
<v Speaker 1>So I'm surprised about it,</v>

11
00:00:43.681 --> 00:00:45.390
<v Speaker 1>but you didn't seem so surprised about it.</v>

12
00:00:45.391 --> 00:00:46.224
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>

13
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.533
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

14
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.580
<v Speaker 2>but not really surprised,</v>

15
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.070
<v Speaker 2>I would say at the moment by anything that happens,</v>

16
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.710
<v Speaker 2>let's say in that conventional media.</v>

17
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.820
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

18
00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.200
<v Speaker 2>I think that what's happened to large degree is that the people,</v>

19
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.350
<v Speaker 2>the journalists who operate in that sphere have started confusing themselves</v>

20
00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:07.580
<v Speaker 2>with the newsmakers themselves.</v>

21
00:01:07.581 --> 00:01:12.230
<v Speaker 2>And so they feel in some sense like they should be leading the narrative,</v>

22
00:01:12.231 --> 00:01:14.000
<v Speaker 2>let's say instead of saying we get,</v>

23
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.460
<v Speaker 2>and so if an event occurs,</v>

24
00:01:16.461 --> 00:01:19.070
<v Speaker 2>that's outside of what they assume.</v>

25
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:20.181
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

26
00:01:20.181 --> 00:01:23.210
<v Speaker 2>we're painting this with a broad brush because there's obviously journalists who</v>

27
00:01:23.211 --> 00:01:24.590
<v Speaker 2>don't fit into this category.</v>

28
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:25.610
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

29
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.220
<v Speaker 2>but if it doesn't fall under their</v>

30
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.780
<v Speaker 2>fall under the guidelines of their a priori story,</v>

31
00:01:32.781 --> 00:01:34.340
<v Speaker 2>then it isn't news.</v>

32
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.370
<v Speaker 2>And all that's happening as a consequence of that though,</v>

33
00:01:37.371 --> 00:01:38.091
<v Speaker 2>I think Serena,</v>

34
00:01:38.091 --> 00:01:40.820
<v Speaker 2>is that they're the mainstream media,</v>

35
00:01:40.821 --> 00:01:41.511
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

36
00:01:41.511 --> 00:01:45.260
<v Speaker 2>is dooming itself to irrelevancy at an unbelievably rapid rate.</v>

37
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.363
<v Speaker 1>See that with,</v>

38
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:48.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

39
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.900
<v Speaker 1>certainly,</v>

40
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:49.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

41
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.630
<v Speaker 1>American news newspapers,</v>

42
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.040
<v Speaker 1>which are now being replaced because people are tuning into social media to get</v>

43
00:01:56.041 --> 00:01:56.874
<v Speaker 1>their news.</v>

44
00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.350
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

45
00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.570
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of people say they don't even actually trust mainstream journalists</v>

46
00:02:00.571 --> 00:02:00.931
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>

47
00:02:00.931 --> 00:02:05.640
<v Speaker 1>which is a sad statement because media is such an important aspect of any</v>

48
00:02:05.641 --> 00:02:06.810
<v Speaker 1>democratic society.</v>

49
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

50
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.691
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

51
00:02:07.691 --> 00:02:09.820
<v Speaker 2>it's become democratized in a big way.</v>

52
00:02:09.821 --> 00:02:11.560
<v Speaker 2>And so maybe this is for the best,</v>

53
00:02:11.561 --> 00:02:12.430
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to say.</v>

54
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:13.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

55
00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.530
<v Speaker 2>there'll be pros and cons.</v>

56
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:15.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

57
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.143
<v Speaker 2>I've had,</v>

58
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.130
<v Speaker 2>I can't complain about my treatment at the hands of the media over the last year</v>

59
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.971
<v Speaker 2>in general,</v>

60
00:02:21.971 --> 00:02:22.271
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

61
00:02:22.271 --> 00:02:22.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

62
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.970
<v Speaker 2>there's been a lot of like post media,</v>

63
00:02:24.971 --> 00:02:29.260
<v Speaker 2>the entire post media group of about 250 newspapers came out in support of what</v>

64
00:02:29.261 --> 00:02:34.261
<v Speaker 2>I was doing and Margaret went to and Christie Blatchford and Conrad Black and</v>

65
00:02:35.021 --> 00:02:35.331
<v Speaker 2>are two,</v>

66
00:02:35.331 --> 00:02:37.720
<v Speaker 2>so em to Nela and a whole array of,</v>

67
00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.810
<v Speaker 2>of journalists have been very forceful advocates,</v>

68
00:02:40.811 --> 00:02:42.190
<v Speaker 2>I would say for free speech.</v>

69
00:02:42.191 --> 00:02:44.230
<v Speaker 2>So we also want to keep that in mind,</v>

70
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.681
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

71
00:02:44.681 --> 00:02:45.461
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

72
00:02:45.461 --> 00:02:46.210
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
