1
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.360
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's look at that user interface idea.</v>

2
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.840
<v Speaker 1>Obviously what happens when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at a computer screen is that the</v>

3
00:00:13.841 --> 00:00:18.460
<v Speaker 1>complexity of the screen is reduced to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>set of icons that can serve as tools.</v>

4
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.390
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's a reasonable way</v>
<v Speaker 1>of thinking about how we look at the</v>

5
00:00:22.391 --> 00:00:23.110
<v Speaker 1>world</v>

6
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.480
<v Speaker 2>flex in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that Hoffman's theory is that natural</v>

7
00:00:25.481 --> 00:00:29.920
<v Speaker 2>selection didn't select our brains to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to record an accurate representation of</v>

8
00:00:29.921 --> 00:00:32.770
<v Speaker 2>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the scientific model we'll attempts</v>

9
00:00:32.771 --> 00:00:34.840
<v Speaker 2>to get ever closer to what reality is</v>
<v Speaker 2>really light.</v>

10
00:00:34.841 --> 00:00:37.630
<v Speaker 2>No natural selection just wants us to</v>
<v Speaker 2>escape predators.</v>

11
00:00:37.631 --> 00:00:41.020
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter what they look like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the icon is in your brain of</v>

12
00:00:41.021 --> 00:00:42.610
<v Speaker 2>breaths,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's brain or whatever,</v>

13
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.560
<v Speaker 2>as long as you survive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all that matters.</v>

14
00:00:44.561 --> 00:00:45.500
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

15
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.270
<v Speaker 2>this is why we're so easily deceived by</v>
<v Speaker 2>illusions and magic tricks and things</v>

16
00:00:49.271 --> 00:00:50.104
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

17
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our brains aren't really wired to,</v>

18
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.660
<v Speaker 2>to represent reality as it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever that means.</v>

19
00:00:55.661 --> 00:00:56.860
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

20
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.710
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can say that without human</v>

21
00:00:59.711 --> 00:01:03.310
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the iconic reality that we inhabit would</v>

22
00:01:03.311 --> 00:01:04.150
<v Speaker 1>not exist.</v>

23
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.590
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

24
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.510
<v Speaker 2>Did that slightly is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

25
00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.870
<v Speaker 2>is I told them so let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

26
00:01:10.871 --> 00:01:12.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's it like to be a dolphin?</v>

27
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

28
00:01:13.961 --> 00:01:16.200
<v Speaker 2>So some kind of echolocation system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

29
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:17.740
<v Speaker 2>and his point is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well there,</v>

30
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sharks are dangerous,</v>

31
00:01:19.181 --> 00:01:20.120
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

32
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.880
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they avoid charts.</v>

33
00:01:21.881 --> 00:01:25.960
<v Speaker 2>But the question is what does a shark</v>
<v Speaker 2>look like in Dalton's brain versus what</v>

34
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.620
<v Speaker 2>it looks like in our brain?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably quite different and I</v>

35
00:01:29.621 --> 00:01:32.110
<v Speaker 2>really have no idea what a shark looks</v>
<v Speaker 2>like two adults,</v>

36
00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.720
<v Speaker 2>but I do know this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're really our shirts and they</v>

37
00:01:34.721 --> 00:01:38.200
<v Speaker 2>really have sharp things on one end and</v>
<v Speaker 2>a tail on the other and they're eating</v>

38
00:01:38.201 --> 00:01:41.360
<v Speaker 2>machines and you should avoid them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

39
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.020
<v Speaker 1>that's actually a weakness of the icon</v>
<v Speaker 1>claim I would say,</v>

40
00:01:46.021 --> 00:01:49.680
<v Speaker 1>because it looks to me like here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the twist on it.</v>

41
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.150
<v Speaker 1>What we see in our conscious experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>are functional icons,</v>

42
00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.410
<v Speaker 1>but they're also low resolution</v>
<v Speaker 1>representations of the things that are</v>

43
00:02:01.411 --> 00:02:03.260
<v Speaker 1>actually there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

44
00:02:03.261 --> 00:02:07.920
<v Speaker 1>and I don't think that computer icons</v>
<v Speaker 1>are low resolution representations of</v>

45
00:02:07.921 --> 00:02:10.890
<v Speaker 1>the things that are there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just functional icons.</v>

46
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.840
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might be wrong about that because,</v>

47
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.850
<v Speaker 1>because it's hard to to conjure up that</v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis on the fly.</v>

48
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.440
<v Speaker 1>But the Trashcan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

49
00:02:19.441 --> 00:02:23.520
<v Speaker 1>on your desktop is actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually a low resolution</v>

50
00:02:23.521 --> 00:02:27.120
<v Speaker 1>representations of an actual trashcan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a computer trashcan,</v>

51
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.290
<v Speaker 1>even though it functions the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

52
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.980
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think I liked the icon idea,</v>

53
00:02:31.981 --> 00:02:35.940
<v Speaker 1>but I think it misses some element of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual relationship between the</v>

54
00:02:35.941 --> 00:02:39.420
<v Speaker 1>perception and the reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We definitely see in low resolution,</v>

55
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.560
<v Speaker 1>which is why we can stand animated</v>
<v Speaker 1>pictures like say the Simpsons,</v>

56
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

57
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.130
<v Speaker 1>where everything is one extremely low</v>
<v Speaker 1>resolution,</v>

58
00:02:47.131 --> 00:02:49.530
<v Speaker 1>but that makes no functional difference</v>
<v Speaker 1>to us whatsoever.</v>

59
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.830
<v Speaker 1>And we definitely see and hear in low</v>
<v Speaker 1>resolution,</v>

60
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.300
<v Speaker 1>but the resolution like I think what we</v>
<v Speaker 1>see or something like instead of icons,</v>

61
00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.620
<v Speaker 1>they're more like thumbnails that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>functional.</v>

62
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.030
<v Speaker 1>That's a good analogy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

63
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.050
<v Speaker 1>I like it because the thumbnail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thumbnail actually is an unbiased</v>

64
00:03:07.391 --> 00:03:11.420
<v Speaker 1>sampling of the actual object,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

65
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.280
<v Speaker 1>Because a photograph is relatively</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbiased sample of an object and you can</v>

66
00:03:15.281 --> 00:03:16.960
<v Speaker 1>compress it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

67
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.180
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can until it,</v>

68
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.830
<v Speaker 1>and what you're doing is blurring out</v>
<v Speaker 1>distinctions between,</v>

69
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.060
<v Speaker 1>you're blurring out distinctions between</v>
<v Speaker 1>different aspects of it without,</v>

70
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.300
<v Speaker 1>without losing the relationship between</v>
<v Speaker 1>the parts.</v>

71
00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.260
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

72
00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.193
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

73
00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In a way,</v>

74
00:03:35.271 --> 00:03:38.120
<v Speaker 2>much of science operates at a</v>
<v Speaker 2>metaphorical level,</v>

75
00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that string,</v>

76
00:03:39.201 --> 00:03:40.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you ever seen a string theory</v>

77
00:03:40.971 --> 00:03:44.240
<v Speaker 2>documentary that didn't have violins</v>
<v Speaker 2>featured in it?</v>

78
00:03:44.241 --> 00:03:45.074
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

79
00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.240
<v Speaker 2>that the computer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the brain is like a computer.</v>

80
00:03:47.241 --> 00:03:52.241
<v Speaker 2>It's like a dual processor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

81
00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.740
<v Speaker 2>Because we have to talk and we have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>transfer the literal meaning of</v>

82
00:03:56.741 --> 00:03:59.740
<v Speaker 2>metaphors to move something from here to</v>
<v Speaker 2>there in the original Greek.</v>

83
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.880
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

84
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.880
<v Speaker 2>we tried to capture some idea that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>really hard to get that buy something</v>

85
00:04:06.041 --> 00:04:07.450
<v Speaker 2>we're very familiar with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
