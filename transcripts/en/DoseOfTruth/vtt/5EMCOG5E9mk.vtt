00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:00.973
<v Speaker 1>Hmm,</v>

2
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.550
<v Speaker 1>among the youngest as the approach</v>
<v Speaker 1>maturity go through a hysterical or</v>

3
00:00:11.551 --> 00:00:14.200
<v Speaker 1>history crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes their vocation manifests</v>

4
00:00:14.201 --> 00:00:17.130
<v Speaker 1>itself at an earlier age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The boy runs away into the mountains and</v>

5
00:00:17.131 --> 00:00:19.560
<v Speaker 1>remains there for a week or more feeding</v>
<v Speaker 1>on animals,</v>

6
00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:21.330
<v Speaker 1>which he terrorists to pieces with his</v>
<v Speaker 1>teeth.</v>

7
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.330
<v Speaker 1>He returns to the village filthy</v>
<v Speaker 1>bloodstained,</v>

8
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.590
<v Speaker 1>and it's only after 10 or more days that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have passed that he began to babble</v>

9
00:00:28.591 --> 00:00:32.700
<v Speaker 1>incoherent words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The strange behavior of future showman's</v>

10
00:00:32.701 --> 00:00:36.690
<v Speaker 1>has not failed to attract the attention</v>
<v Speaker 1>of scholars and from the middle of the</v>

11
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.980
<v Speaker 1>past century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>several attempts have been made to</v>

12
00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:40.170
<v Speaker 1>explain the phenomena as a mental</v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder,</v>

13
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.110
<v Speaker 1>but the problem was wrongly put four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand,</v>

14
00:00:43.111 --> 00:00:47.430
<v Speaker 1>it is not true that showman's always are</v>
<v Speaker 1>always have to be neuropathic,</v>

15
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.910
<v Speaker 1>mentally deranged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

16
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.810
<v Speaker 1>and this is the critical issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those among them who had been healed</v>

17
00:00:53.811 --> 00:00:56.940
<v Speaker 1>become shamans precisely because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>had succeeded in becoming cured.</v>

18
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.540
<v Speaker 1>So it was not the descent into this</v>
<v Speaker 1>strange subterranean psychological state</v>

19
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.050
<v Speaker 1>that constitutes the transformation that</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes the showman,</v>

20
00:01:07.051 --> 00:01:10.320
<v Speaker 1>but it's the emergence back out of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a journey to the underworld</v>

21
00:01:10.321 --> 00:01:11.850
<v Speaker 1>and a and a rebirth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

22
00:01:11.851 --> 00:01:14.070
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's this great book,</v>

23
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.640
<v Speaker 1>this is a great book by a guy named</v>
<v Speaker 1>Henri Ellenberger Shay,</v>

24
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.240
<v Speaker 1>and he was an existential,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a psychoanalyst and philosopher,</v>

25
00:01:21.241 --> 00:01:23.820
<v Speaker 1>and he wrote a book called the discovery</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the unconscious,</v>

26
00:01:23.821 --> 00:01:26.550
<v Speaker 1>which I would highly recommend it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's on my list of recommended readings.</v>

27
00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.350
<v Speaker 1>It is a great book if you want to know</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the psychoanalytic tradition,</v>

28
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the best introduction there is.</v>

29
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.360
<v Speaker 1>And he discusses Adler and young and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud and does a very credible job of</v>

30
00:01:39.361 --> 00:01:43.740
<v Speaker 1>all three but also takes the history of</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalytic thought back three or 400</v>

31
00:01:43.741 --> 00:01:47.070
<v Speaker 1>years before Freud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's very engaging,</v>

32
00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:48.510
<v Speaker 1>reading and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

33
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.130
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and very interesting.</v>

34
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.210
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things Ellenberg shape</v>
<v Speaker 1>points out quite clearly is,</v>

35
00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.400
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he associates this to some degree</v>

36
00:01:56.401 --> 00:01:58.710
<v Speaker 1>with the shamanic tradition that both</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud and young,</v>

37
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.390
<v Speaker 1>young in particular underwent very</v>
<v Speaker 1>intense periods of psychological</v>

38
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.920
<v Speaker 1>disturbance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say,</v>

39
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.060
<v Speaker 1>and I would say what was happening is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that because they were questioning their</v>

40
00:02:09.061 --> 00:02:13.620
<v Speaker 1>axioms at the most fundamental level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were deranging their cognitive and</v>

41
00:02:13.621 --> 00:02:15.150
<v Speaker 1>perceptual structures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

42
00:02:15.151 --> 00:02:18.450
<v Speaker 1>and young was also experimenting with</v>
<v Speaker 1>imaginative techniques,</v>

43
00:02:18.451 --> 00:02:22.350
<v Speaker 1>with visionary techniques which he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which he did lot and there was a period</v>

44
00:02:22.351 --> 00:02:25.140
<v Speaker 1>of his life where he was having</v>
<v Speaker 1>constant,</v>

45
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.560
<v Speaker 1>a constant stream of visions which you</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote down in a book called the red</v>

46
00:02:28.561 --> 00:02:31.100
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time he was still</v>

47
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.160
<v Speaker 1>functioning as a psychiatrist and</v>
<v Speaker 1>operating normally in the world and so</v>

48
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.880
<v Speaker 1>people have suggested that what he had</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a psychotic break.</v>

49
00:02:38.881 --> 00:02:40.650
<v Speaker 1>But that's ridiculous because you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

50
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.480
<v Speaker 1>That's not how it works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

51
00:02:42.481 --> 00:02:43.890
<v Speaker 1>If you're having a psychotic break,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

52
00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.990
<v Speaker 1>you're not being an effective</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychiatrist.</v>

53
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.930
<v Speaker 1>Those things do not go together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially not for a long period of</v>

54
00:02:48.931 --> 00:02:50.430
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there,</v>

55
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:55.490
<v Speaker 1>there's the possibility of extreme</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience without cyclocross</v>

56
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.930
<v Speaker 1>psychopathology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

57
00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:59.870
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Elena Bursa,</v>

58
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.230
<v Speaker 1>he just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says much the same thing about Freud</v>

59
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.770
<v Speaker 1>and about Charles Darwin as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who underwent a terrible period of,</v>

60
00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.020
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of mental</v>

61
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.990
<v Speaker 1>confusion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

62
00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:13.900
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence of formulating his</v>
<v Speaker 1>theory of evolution,</v>

63
00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:15.640
<v Speaker 1>which was really hard on him because he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a,</v>

64
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.060
<v Speaker 1>he was a die hard Christian and he knew</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he knew,</v>

65
00:03:19.061 --> 00:03:21.280
<v Speaker 1>what the implications of his theory</v>
<v Speaker 1>word.</v>

66
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.960
<v Speaker 1>He didn't know what to do about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

67
00:03:22.961 --> 00:03:24.610
<v Speaker 1>so it was very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very hard on him.</v>

68
00:03:24.611 --> 00:03:29.560
<v Speaker 1>So it's quite common for people of</v>
<v Speaker 1>genius to go through an intense crisis,</v>

69
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.980
<v Speaker 1>psychological crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then resolve that.</v>

70
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.050
<v Speaker 1>And the genius is in the resolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

71
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.890
<v Speaker 1>The precondition for the genius is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dissolution in some sense because you</v>

72
00:03:38.891 --> 00:03:42.460
<v Speaker 1>have to be obsessed with a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to grip you completely before</v>

73
00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:45.340
<v Speaker 1>you're going to concentrate on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So obsessively that you might come up</v>

74
00:03:45.341 --> 00:03:47.710
<v Speaker 1>with a solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's the people who come up with a</v>

75
00:03:47.711 --> 00:03:52.550
<v Speaker 1>solution that are the prophets in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sharmane and so forth and so on and,</v>

76
00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.340
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's not.</v>

77
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.180
<v Speaker 1>This isn't something that only</v>
<v Speaker 1>characterizes our cultures.</v>

78
00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.640
<v Speaker 1>We just don't recognize it in our own</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture properly and,</v>

79
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.130
<v Speaker 1>and that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

80
00:04:03.131 --> 00:04:06.070
<v Speaker 1>sometimes we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

81
00:04:06.071 --> 00:04:07.090
<v Speaker 1>You remember that in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

82
00:04:07.091 --> 00:04:08.250
<v Speaker 1>in the lion king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

83
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.290
<v Speaker 1>That Rafiki shows up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the chairman.</v>

84
00:04:10.291 --> 00:04:10.890
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

85
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.460
<v Speaker 1>he brings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he brings up Simba down that tunnel dark</v>

86
00:04:15.461 --> 00:04:17.170
<v Speaker 1>tunnel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the dark night of the soul.</v>

87
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.690
<v Speaker 1>He has them reflect upon himself and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pool.</v>

88
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.570
<v Speaker 1>When he reflects upon himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply sees the reflection of his</v>

89
00:04:22.571 --> 00:04:25.270
<v Speaker 1>father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that becomes a thing of cosmic</v>

90
00:04:25.271 --> 00:04:29.200
<v Speaker 1>significance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And his father appears in the sky just</v>

91
00:04:29.201 --> 00:04:33.370
<v Speaker 1>like God appears to Jacob and basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>tells them that it's time for him to</v>

92
00:04:33.371 --> 00:04:38.320
<v Speaker 1>grow the hell up and to return to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>devastated kingdom and to set it right.</v>

93
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so and that's right.</v>

94
00:04:41.351 --> 00:04:42.610
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

95
00:04:42.611 --> 00:04:46.330
<v Speaker 1>we live in the devastated kingdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an eternal truth and it's the</v>

96
00:04:46.331 --> 00:04:51.331
<v Speaker 1>responsibility of the individual to grow</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hell up and to set it right because</v>

97
00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.280
<v Speaker 1>when it's devastated and when things are</v>
<v Speaker 1>not in place,</v>

98
00:04:54.281 --> 00:04:57.820
<v Speaker 1>then everyone suffers too much and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not good.</v>

99
00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.670
<v Speaker 1>And there's no excuse for not doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>something about it because you don't</v>

100
00:05:00.671 --> 00:05:05.671
<v Speaker 1>have anything better to do so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even like children's movies tell you</v>

101
00:05:07.301 --> 00:05:07.780
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
