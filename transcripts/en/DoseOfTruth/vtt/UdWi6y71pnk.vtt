<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

46

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.260
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

48

<v Speaker 1>so it looks like we're good,</v>

53
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.400
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

54
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.233
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

55
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.313

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

58
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.943
<v Speaker 1>that's bad.</v>

59
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.053
<v Speaker 1>That's bad.</v>

60
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.750
<v Speaker 1>No Echo on no echo on either one.</v>

61
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.330
<v Speaker 1>It must've been some priorities,</v>

62
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.680
<v Speaker 1>driver issue that right things in the right order or something</v>

63
00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.593
<v Speaker 2>or something.</v>

64
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:01.803
<v Speaker 1>Ice.</v>

65
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:02.733
<v Speaker 1>It makes me happy</v>

66
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.270
<v Speaker 1>because I knew nothing to do at that point.</v>

67
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:09.890
<v Speaker 1>Nothing I could do.</v>

68
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:10.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

69
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:11.020
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

70
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.853
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

71
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.710
<v Speaker 1>you were alright.</v>

72
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.090
<v Speaker 1>So back to the Sargon</v>

73
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.120
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

74
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.331
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

75
00:02:19.331 --> 00:02:19.931
<v Speaker 1>So uh,</v>

76
00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:24.760
<v Speaker 1>you had asked me if I had a watched the video and I finished it</v>

77
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.220
<v Speaker 1>today a few hours ago and uh,</v>

78
00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.751
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

79
00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:32.720
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that,</v>

80
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.150
<v Speaker 1>that I had mentioned to you in the beginning because I hadn't watched the rest</v>

81
00:02:37.151 --> 00:02:37.631
<v Speaker 1>of the video,</v>

82
00:02:37.631 --> 00:02:39.190
<v Speaker 1>was how like,</v>

83
00:02:39.191 --> 00:02:39.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

84
00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:40.360
<v Speaker 1>that group,</v>

85
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.360
<v Speaker 1>Chapo Trap House basically a seemed to be siting with A.</v>

86
00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm forgetting the director's name again.</v>

87
00:02:48.131 --> 00:02:49.000
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember his name.</v>

88
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.913
<v Speaker 1>What was it?</v>

89
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.500
<v Speaker 1>Over Verhoeven?</v>

90
00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:54.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

91
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.880
<v Speaker 1>I'll remember that now.</v>

92
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.020
<v Speaker 1>Relevant for Hoven a diaper.</v>

93
00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.800
<v Speaker 1>I rewatched the that day too,</v>

94
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 1>just</v>

95
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.630
<v Speaker 3>to keep up with it.</v>

96
00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:02.050
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

97
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.740
<v Speaker 3>if go,</v>

98
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:03.071
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

99
00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:05.080
<v Speaker 3>And so verhoeven was,</v>

100
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.293
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

101
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.850
<v Speaker 1>was basically creating what he thought was a movie based off have based off of</v>

102
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.973
<v Speaker 1>but a movie,</v>

103
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.343
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

104
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.700
<v Speaker 1>or a story that he believed was a fascistic and uh,</v>

105
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

106
00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.250
<v Speaker 1>Sargon pointed out that,</v>

107
00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:26.031
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

108
00:03:26.031 --> 00:03:26.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

109
00:03:26.241 --> 00:03:27.950
<v Speaker 1>it's a voluntary society.</v>

110
00:03:27.951 --> 00:03:29.090
<v Speaker 1>Everybody who joins up,</v>

111
00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

112
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:30.710
<v Speaker 1>does so willingly,</v>

113
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.650
<v Speaker 1>nobody's conscripted and</v>

114
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.351
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

115
00:03:34.351 --> 00:03:35.130
<v Speaker 3>it's almost,</v>

116
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.500
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like verhoeven didn't even read the book,</v>

117
00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.490
<v Speaker 3>which is true.</v>

118
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:39.420
<v Speaker 3>You didn't actually read it.</v>

119
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:41.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

120
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.063
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

121
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:43.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't really.</v>

122
00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:44.111
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

123
00:03:44.111 --> 00:03:44.944
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

124
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.250
<v Speaker 3>it's over fighting with the source material constantly.</v>

125
00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:49.483
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

126
00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.740
<v Speaker 3>that made no sense because you didn't hit second year already.</v>

127
00:03:52.741 --> 00:03:54.460
<v Speaker 3>You hardly use the source material.</v>

128
00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.840
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

129
00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.210
<v Speaker 3>it was like that old Batman show.</v>

130
00:03:57.211 --> 00:03:58.021
<v Speaker 3>It's not really bad,</v>

131
00:03:58.021 --> 00:03:58.211
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

132
00:03:58.211 --> 00:03:58.481
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

133
00:03:58.481 --> 00:03:59.314
<v Speaker 3>almost like a sharp.</v>

134
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.233
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

135
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:02.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

136
00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:03.480
<v Speaker 1>And compared to good.</v>

137
00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.440
<v Speaker 1>And they considered it fascistic,</v>

138
00:04:06.441 --> 00:04:06.591
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

139
00:04:06.591 --> 00:04:11.150
<v Speaker 1>they considered it to be a work of fascism and uh,</v>

140
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:12.663
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't.</v>

141
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:13.070
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

142
00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.000
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't make sense to me.</v>

143
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:15.050
<v Speaker 1>The only way I could,</v>

144
00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.093
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>

145
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.073
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

146
00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.870
<v Speaker 1>see it or see them as interpreting it as fast as well as being this,</v>

147
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.313
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

148
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
<v Speaker 1>like them using the Arachnids as them not taking a literal approach to the</v>

149
00:04:32.461 --> 00:04:33.294
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>

150
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.901
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

151
00:04:33.901 --> 00:04:38.901
<v Speaker 1>rather than being arachnids maybe it could be humans and because I never read</v>

152
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.481
<v Speaker 1>the book,</v>

153
00:04:42.481 --> 00:04:45.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if the directors are still the same insect creatures where they</v>

154
00:04:45.691 --> 00:04:46.524
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

155
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.320
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

156
00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.520
<v Speaker 3>there's a couple of races actually there's the terrans with other humans and</v>

157
00:04:50.521 --> 00:04:54.420
<v Speaker 3>then there's the skinnies which the way they describe and is very strange.</v>

158
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.510
<v Speaker 3>So you have to kind of use your imagination but just imagine like a really</v>

159
00:04:57.511 --> 00:04:58.800
<v Speaker 3>skinny alien guy.</v>

160
00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.270
<v Speaker 3>And then there's directors and in the beginning of the rapids are sort of allied</v>

161
00:05:03.271 --> 00:05:07.980
<v Speaker 3>with the skinnies and then over time the human start like rating the skinnies</v>

162
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.750
<v Speaker 3>and basically thought not killing a lot of them but just kinda like fucking shit</v>

163
00:05:12.751 --> 00:05:13.500
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

164
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.270
<v Speaker 3>And in doing so they get the skinny to change sides to give them intelligence</v>

165
00:05:18.271 --> 00:05:19.630
<v Speaker 3>and how to help the feed the,</v>

166
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.620
<v Speaker 3>it's because the humans aren't doing very well in the book against them.</v>

167
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.551
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

168
00:05:23.551 --> 00:05:23.670
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

169
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.570
<v Speaker 3>they kind of have to turn the skinnies first and it opens up with a sore toe</v>

170
00:05:27.571 --> 00:05:29.850
<v Speaker 3>against the skinnies and it's quite descriptive.</v>

171
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:30.091
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

172
00:05:30.091 --> 00:05:31.020
<v Speaker 3>it is science fiction,</v>

173
00:05:31.021 --> 00:05:34.140
<v Speaker 3>so it was way different than the movie,</v>

174
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.033
<v Speaker 3>like the movie.</v>

175
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.670
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

176
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.330
<v Speaker 3>the way their hoven shows it,</v>

177
00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.870
<v Speaker 3>it was clearly you didn't read the book.</v>

178
00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:40.531
<v Speaker 3>He clearly,</v>

179
00:05:40.531 --> 00:05:42.700
<v Speaker 3>he must have been fighting with the writer because the writer,</v>

180
00:05:42.701 --> 00:05:43.411
<v Speaker 3>I read the book,</v>

181
00:05:43.411 --> 00:05:48.411
<v Speaker 3>but they must've just been a constant battle to get things properly in there.</v>

182
00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:49.651
<v Speaker 3>There are some things,</v>

183
00:05:49.651 --> 00:05:50.311
<v Speaker 3>we're obviously,</v>

184
00:05:50.311 --> 00:05:51.750
<v Speaker 3>they had to squish it all together,</v>

185
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:52.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

186
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.480
<v Speaker 3>because the way they filled with adapt from movies or um,</v>

187
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.890
<v Speaker 3>sort of films with that from books.</v>

188
00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.640
<v Speaker 3>But a lot of the stuff didn't make a lot of sense.</v>

189
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:00.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

190
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.651
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

191
00:06:00.651 --> 00:06:05.651
<v Speaker 4>I think that if verhoeven had actually read the book,</v>

192
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:11.470
<v Speaker 4>he would have had more of an argument of it being a metaphor for fascism in</v>

193
00:06:12.321 --> 00:06:13.154
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

194
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.311
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>

195
00:06:14.311 --> 00:06:15.560
<v Speaker 4>I may be completely wrong,</v>

196
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:16.311
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

197
00:06:16.311 --> 00:06:16.660
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

198
00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:17.630
<v Speaker 4>if humans were,</v>

199
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:19.700
<v Speaker 4>were committing the violence against humans,</v>

200
00:06:19.701 --> 00:06:19.941
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

201
00:06:19.941 --> 00:06:20.900
<v Speaker 4>if it wasn't the same,</v>

202
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.700
<v Speaker 4>the same to the same capacity where the Arachnids we're just mindless</v>

203
00:06:25.701 --> 00:06:26.570
<v Speaker 4>destroyers,</v>

204
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.811
<v Speaker 4>then you know,</v>

205
00:06:27.811 --> 00:06:28.644
<v Speaker 4>you could,</v>

206
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.140
<v Speaker 4>you could say,</v>

207
00:06:30.141 --> 00:06:30.950
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

208
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:31.221
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

209
00:06:31.221 --> 00:06:31.750
<v Speaker 4>the human,</v>

210
00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:32.301
<v Speaker 4>the Terran,</v>

211
00:06:32.301 --> 00:06:34.340
<v Speaker 4>we're just protecting themselves.</v>

212
00:06:34.341 --> 00:06:35.300
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

213
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.260
<v Speaker 4>if they weren't,</v>

214
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.100
<v Speaker 4>if they weren't protecting themselves.</v>

215
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:40.551
<v Speaker 4>But see,</v>

216
00:06:40.551 --> 00:06:41.510
<v Speaker 4>that's the thing is that I,</v>

217
00:06:41.511 --> 00:06:42.260
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

218
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.130
<v Speaker 4>I haven't read the book.</v>

219
00:06:43.131 --> 00:06:48.131
<v Speaker 4>I mean with the skinnies not violent and did the terran initiate violence</v>

220
00:06:48.891 --> 00:06:52.190
<v Speaker 4>against the skin and all of this is irrelevant because verhoeven did read the</v>

221
00:06:52.191 --> 00:06:52.840
<v Speaker 4>book.</v>

222
00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.700
<v Speaker 4>But I mean now I'm trying to make a case for fascism.</v>

223
00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:56.703
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

224
00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:59.410
<v Speaker 3>skinnies weren't even really involved like even in the book,</v>

225
00:06:59.411 --> 00:07:01.150
<v Speaker 3>but we just talked about.</v>

226
00:07:01.151 --> 00:07:01.984
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

227
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:02.690
<v Speaker 3>they were,</v>

228
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:04.650
<v Speaker 3>they had kind of switched sides to the humans.</v>

229
00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

230
00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:06.971
<v Speaker 3>Detail to really,</v>

231
00:07:06.971 --> 00:07:09.430
<v Speaker 3>I guess maybe make part of the movie.</v>

232
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.510
<v Speaker 3>So maybe that's why they didn't include them because I was confused at first I</v>

233
00:07:13.511 --> 00:07:14.231
<v Speaker 3>was reading the book and I'm like,</v>

234
00:07:14.231 --> 00:07:15.020
<v Speaker 3>where's the Arachnids?</v>

235
00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:15.680
<v Speaker 3>They're like fighting news.</v>

236
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.920
<v Speaker 3>We're thinking still skinnies.</v>

237
00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:17.681
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

238
00:07:17.681 --> 00:07:17.831
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

239
00:07:17.831 --> 00:07:18.660
<v Speaker 3>in the movie</v>

240
00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.990
<v Speaker 5>sample is another part where there's like the Mormon extreme mormon columnists</v>

241
00:07:21.991 --> 00:07:22.824
<v Speaker 5>or whatever,</v>

242
00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:24.760
<v Speaker 5>but they're not in the book at all.</v>

243
00:07:24.761 --> 00:07:26.430
<v Speaker 5>And even after I finished the book I was like,</v>

244
00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:26.840
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

245
00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:27.271
<v Speaker 5>wait a minute.</v>

246
00:07:27.271 --> 00:07:29.040
<v Speaker 5>Wasn't there like Mormon columnists or something?</v>

247
00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.450
<v Speaker 5>Did I like miss those pages?</v>

248
00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:30.841
<v Speaker 5>But no,</v>

249
00:07:30.841 --> 00:07:32.280
<v Speaker 5>they're just not in the book at all.</v>

250
00:07:32.281 --> 00:07:34.830
<v Speaker 5>I went online just to make sure it wasn't fucked up because I read,</v>

251
00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.370
<v Speaker 5>I read the book pretty quickly over a period of a couple of days.</v>

252
00:07:38.371 --> 00:07:39.150
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

253
00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:39.983
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

254
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:40.370
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

255
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:40.931
<v Speaker 3>I was just worried.</v>

256
00:07:40.931 --> 00:07:41.640
<v Speaker 3>I maybe like,</v>

257
00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:42.890
<v Speaker 3>must have like blanked out,</v>

258
00:07:42.891 --> 00:07:45.710
<v Speaker 3>but I know there is no mormons in the book at all of us just made up.</v>

259
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:49.220
<v Speaker 3>I guess they have to make him look bad or something.</v>

260
00:07:49.221 --> 00:07:50.054
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

261
00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.313
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

262
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:53.050
<v Speaker 3>But I wonder if the</v>

263
00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.330
<v Speaker 3>good</v>

264
00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.840
<v Speaker 4>that was going to say I wonder what verhoeven's outside of,</v>

265
00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:58.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

266
00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.010
<v Speaker 4>being a director,</v>

267
00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:00.660
<v Speaker 4>what his politics are.</v>

268
00:08:00.661 --> 00:08:01.190
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

269
00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:02.023
<v Speaker 4>what he,</v>

270
00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:03.030
<v Speaker 4>what he believes,</v>

271
00:08:03.031 --> 00:08:03.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

272
00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:03.991
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

273
00:08:03.991 --> 00:08:04.824
<v Speaker 4>I guess we kind of.</v>

274
00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:06.673
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>

275
00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.310
<v Speaker 5>well my guess is that he's kind of not,</v>

276
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:11.250
<v Speaker 5>like not a far left.</v>

277
00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:15.780
<v Speaker 5>It's like a default socialist or be full Democrat sort of thing through to</v>

278
00:08:15.781 --> 00:08:17.220
<v Speaker 5>translate to American politics.</v>

279
00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:17.571
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

280
00:08:17.571 --> 00:08:19.130
<v Speaker 3>definitely a social democrat,</v>

281
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:23.480
<v Speaker 3>like not nothing in the movie.</v>

282
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:25.850
<v Speaker 3>Even the movie like it's funny,</v>

283
00:08:25.851 --> 00:08:28.150
<v Speaker 3>I think if he thought it wasn't a,</v>

284
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:31.190
<v Speaker 3>I think if you had not thought it was a fascist,</v>

285
00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:32.810
<v Speaker 3>like based system,</v>

286
00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.690
<v Speaker 3>I think he probably wouldn't have made the movie because then he wouldn't have</v>

287
00:08:35.691 --> 00:08:36.524
<v Speaker 3>been able to market.</v>

288
00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:39.860
<v Speaker 3>I think he probably would have like the movie wouldn't have gotten made,</v>

289
00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:44.330
<v Speaker 3>so maybe it's a good thing that he kind of fucked it up because that way at</v>

290
00:08:44.331 --> 00:08:45.950
<v Speaker 3>least the film was presented.</v>

291
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:47.463
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

292
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:48.620
<v Speaker 3>that's probably the,</v>

293
00:08:48.621 --> 00:08:48.980
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

294
00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.510
<v Speaker 3>the recipe to his success.</v>

295
00:08:50.511 --> 00:08:53.150
<v Speaker 3>Just a making a mockery of something.</v>

296
00:08:53.151 --> 00:08:56.860
<v Speaker 3>Just Straw manning a straw man or something,</v>

297
00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:57.231
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

298
00:08:57.231 --> 00:08:58.064
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't exist.</v>

299
00:08:59.180 --> 00:08:59.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

300
00:08:59.480 --> 00:08:59.991
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

301
00:08:59.991 --> 00:09:00.240
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

302
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:00.841
<v Speaker 3>it's really easy.</v>

303
00:09:00.841 --> 00:09:02.520
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a lot of people talk about like,</v>

304
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:03.563
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

305
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:06.810
<v Speaker 3>there's like rising outright and fascism or whatever.</v>

306
00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:07.290
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

307
00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:08.850
<v Speaker 3>but it's really the easiest,</v>

308
00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:13.110
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the easiest ideologies to make fun of because they're both rooted in</v>

309
00:09:13.111 --> 00:09:17.460
<v Speaker 3>a collective level of [inaudible] and he galleon like collectivism,</v>

310
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:19.800
<v Speaker 3>which I was just listening.</v>

311
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.020
<v Speaker 3>I was listening to your,</v>

312
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.480
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

313
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:21.670
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

314
00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:22.830
<v Speaker 3>the link you sent me a camera.</v>

315
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:24.000
<v Speaker 3>That was the.</v>

316
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:24.840
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

317
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:29.840
<v Speaker 3>it was the stability and excellent Quinn's Slobodin I think that was listening</v>

318
00:09:30.451 --> 00:09:30.781
<v Speaker 3>to him.</v>

319
00:09:30.781 --> 00:09:31.880
<v Speaker 3>And then I listened to a,</v>

320
00:09:31.881 --> 00:09:32.280
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

321
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:32.911
<v Speaker 3>also today,</v>

322
00:09:32.911 --> 00:09:35.190
<v Speaker 3>Steven Hicks explaining postmodernism.</v>

323
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:40.200
<v Speaker 3>Have you read or listened to that a while ago?</v>

324
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:40.860
<v Speaker 3>I think when,</v>

325
00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:42.270
<v Speaker 3>when I first started listening to Peterson,</v>

326
00:09:42.271 --> 00:09:44.100
<v Speaker 3>I listened a little bit too,</v>

327
00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:48.840
<v Speaker 3>Steven Hicks and I can't remember much of what I heard and I can't recall the,</v>

328
00:09:48.841 --> 00:09:49.670
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

329
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:52.980
<v Speaker 3>the Peterson Steven Hicks conversation.</v>

330
00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:54.360
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

331
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:54.541
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

332
00:09:54.541 --> 00:09:54.991
<v Speaker 3>I listened,</v>

333
00:09:54.991 --> 00:09:58.530
<v Speaker 3>I listened to Steven Hicks has audio book explaining,</v>

334
00:09:58.740 --> 00:09:59.820
<v Speaker 3>explaining postmodernism.</v>

335
00:09:59.821 --> 00:10:01.110
<v Speaker 3>He has a couple of interviews.</v>

336
00:10:01.111 --> 00:10:01.591
<v Speaker 3>I guess you'd be,</v>

337
00:10:01.591 --> 00:10:02.940
<v Speaker 3>I'd probably see on the same ones you have,</v>

338
00:10:02.941 --> 00:10:06.270
<v Speaker 3>but I've listened to the audiobook and it goes into like the detail from the</v>

339
00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.530
<v Speaker 3>medieval ages basically.</v>

340
00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:08.773
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

341
00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:09.780
<v Speaker 3>cool.</v>

342
00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:10.830
<v Speaker 3>Can you give me the gist of it?</v>

343
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:12.301
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

344
00:10:12.301 --> 00:10:16.020
<v Speaker 3>well he runs through like how postmodernism came to be then it Kinda,</v>

345
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:17.220
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

346
00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:17.520
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

347
00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:18.810
<v Speaker 3>it's a six hour audio books,</v>

348
00:10:18.811 --> 00:10:23.400
<v Speaker 3>so it's Kinda hard to make it smaller to understand,</v>

349
00:10:23.401 --> 00:10:25.320
<v Speaker 3>but I recommend listening to that.</v>

350
00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:26.880
<v Speaker 3>But essentially,</v>

351
00:10:26.881 --> 00:10:27.714
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

352
00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.510
<v Speaker 3>you go from Emmanuel Kant,</v>

353
00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:31.051
<v Speaker 3>so you have the,</v>

354
00:10:31.051 --> 00:10:31.884
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

355
00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:33.350
<v Speaker 3>the enlightenment movement,</v>

356
00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:37.920
<v Speaker 3>which is this idea that things are real and you can sense things and you'd get</v>

357
00:10:37.921 --> 00:10:40.320
<v Speaker 3>like empiricists and uh,</v>

358
00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:45.990
<v Speaker 3>a rationalist and these different groups that kind of compete with each other,</v>

359
00:10:45.991 --> 00:10:47.490
<v Speaker 3>but they believe the world's real right.</v>

360
00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:49.050
<v Speaker 3>And it works.</v>

361
00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:50.610
<v Speaker 3>It works really well for science,</v>

362
00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:52.710
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't work so well with like the,</v>

363
00:10:52.711 --> 00:10:52.920
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

364
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.900
<v Speaker 3>spiritual humanity side of things.</v>

365
00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:55.800
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

366
00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.570
<v Speaker 3>that was exposed by Emmanuel Kant.</v>

367
00:10:57.630 --> 00:10:58.950
<v Speaker 3>He was part of the counter enlightenment.</v>

368
00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:01.260
<v Speaker 3>And over time you find,</v>

369
00:11:01.261 --> 00:11:01.840
<v Speaker 3>can't,</v>

370
00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:02.673
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

371
00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:04.120
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>

372
00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.070
<v Speaker 3>he says,</v>

373
00:11:05.071 --> 00:11:05.850
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

374
00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:06.860
<v Speaker 3>science is fine,</v>

375
00:11:06.861 --> 00:11:08.400
<v Speaker 3>that it's explaining about these things,</v>

376
00:11:08.401 --> 00:11:11.130
<v Speaker 3>but you can't explain the other half of humanity,</v>

377
00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:14.310
<v Speaker 3>the humanities and like a religion,</v>

378
00:11:14.311 --> 00:11:15.144
<v Speaker 3>for example.</v>

379
00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:15.691
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

380
00:11:15.691 --> 00:11:18.400
<v Speaker 3>with the same techniques because they don't match match.</v>

381
00:11:18.401 --> 00:11:19.021
<v Speaker 3>Like for example,</v>

382
00:11:19.021 --> 00:11:19.431
<v Speaker 3>you know how you,</v>

383
00:11:19.431 --> 00:11:20.690
<v Speaker 3>if you drink a,</v>

384
00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:21.720
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

385
00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.800
<v Speaker 3>an orange tastes sweet,</v>

386
00:11:22.801 --> 00:11:23.190
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

387
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:27.180
<v Speaker 3>When do you eat an orange but not after you drink like a sugary drink?</v>

388
00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:29.453
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

389
00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:30.653
<v Speaker 3>So it,</v>

390
00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:31.493
<v Speaker 3>what he's saying is like,</v>

391
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:31.830
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

392
00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:35.670
<v Speaker 3>how do you know whether the orange is sweet or what was the true nature of it?</v>

393
00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.070
<v Speaker 3>Because it's sweet when you get it on its own,</v>

394
00:11:38.071 --> 00:11:39.930
<v Speaker 3>but if you needed after eating the chocolate cake,</v>

395
00:11:39.931 --> 00:11:40.561
<v Speaker 3>it tastes sour.</v>

396
00:11:40.561 --> 00:11:45.390
<v Speaker 3>So he goes into those sorts of things and that's just the subjectivity of,</v>

397
00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:46.100
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

398
00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:49.020
<v Speaker 3>your sense or the subjectivity of empiricism,</v>

399
00:11:49.021 --> 00:11:50.550
<v Speaker 3>I guess since data,</v>

400
00:11:50.551 --> 00:11:50.851
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

401
00:11:50.851 --> 00:11:51.800
<v Speaker 3>That's parasitism,</v>

402
00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:52.540
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

403
00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:53.373
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

404
00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:55.210
<v Speaker 3>so you're saying you can't trust it.</v>

405
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:56.583
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

406
00:11:57.930 --> 00:11:58.491
<v Speaker 3>So from,</v>

407
00:11:58.491 --> 00:11:58.840
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

408
00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.120
<v Speaker 3>Kantz a,</v>

409
00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:01.500
<v Speaker 3>that's where the,</v>

410
00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:06.500
<v Speaker 3>that's where the German school kind of booked this anchor in with cans and uh,</v>

411
00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:11.750
<v Speaker 3>like the first one to the mirror and you say journalists before,</v>

412
00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:12.830
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

413
00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:15.720
<v Speaker 3>this is way before that I'm talking to like Prussia and stuff.</v>

414
00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:16.260
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

415
00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:17.190
<v Speaker 3>so can't,</v>

416
00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:22.220
<v Speaker 3>became a sort of the German continental sort of system of philosophy versus like</v>

417
00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:25.500
<v Speaker 3>the British and French more,</v>

418
00:12:25.501 --> 00:12:26.334
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

419
00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:28.070
<v Speaker 3>a more opportune,</v>

420
00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:33.230
<v Speaker 3>sort of a philosophy like unlocking philosophy is like basically what the United</v>

421
00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:38.370
<v Speaker 3>States was founded on Rehab your rights and all that stuff.</v>

422
00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:39.703
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

423
00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:40.370
<v Speaker 3>but in,</v>

424
00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:41.610
<v Speaker 3>in Germany is different.</v>

425
00:12:41.611 --> 00:12:46.611
<v Speaker 3>Like the way their philosophy came about was a lot another thing sargon goes</v>

426
00:12:47.311 --> 00:12:50.700
<v Speaker 3>into in another video where he talks about how,</v>

427
00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:52.560
<v Speaker 3>because of the German question,</v>

428
00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:54.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

429
00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:55.103
<v Speaker 3>as a joke,</v>

430
00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.160
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

431
00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:56.640
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

432
00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:00.750
<v Speaker 3>he goes into how like the Germans are very imperialist and they seem to try to</v>

433
00:13:00.751 --> 00:13:04.290
<v Speaker 3>reform an empire of the good they call it.</v>

434
00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:10.040
<v Speaker 3>And this goes back to Russia would like Frederick the great and he formed the,</v>

435
00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:14.880
<v Speaker 3>you started like public schools for boys and you've tried to make his army</v>

436
00:13:14.881 --> 00:13:17.610
<v Speaker 3>professional rather than being peasants and stuff.</v>

437
00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:22.050
<v Speaker 3>And it developed this sort of like Germans superiority.</v>

438
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:23.040
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

439
00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:23.131
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

440
00:13:23.131 --> 00:13:24.660
<v Speaker 3>the German doesn't need to be educated.</v>

441
00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:29.460
<v Speaker 3>They're fine being a dom and pour on the farm and that's that they're superior</v>

442
00:13:29.461 --> 00:13:31.260
<v Speaker 3>people and all this other stuff.</v>

443
00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:31.761
<v Speaker 3>And that,</v>

444
00:13:31.761 --> 00:13:36.761
<v Speaker 3>that developed slowly with it eventually that Kinda came up in some parts as</v>

445
00:13:37.171 --> 00:13:41.560
<v Speaker 3>Nazi-ism in some parts as Marxism in competition,</v>

446
00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.170
<v Speaker 3>like as,</v>

447
00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:42.411
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>

448
00:13:42.411 --> 00:13:43.860
<v Speaker 3>as a collective ideology.</v>

449
00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:46.470
<v Speaker 3>And that's where you see all the collective ivl she's came from,</v>

450
00:13:46.471 --> 00:13:47.580
<v Speaker 3>they came from like a,</v>

451
00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:52.640
<v Speaker 3>he galleon then marks and then do a genteel gentilly on the fascist side of</v>

452
00:13:53.131 --> 00:13:53.964
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

453
00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:55.920
<v Speaker 3>They came out to be a collectivist.</v>

454
00:13:55.921 --> 00:13:58.520
<v Speaker 3>And if you look at the British and the American side of politics,</v>

455
00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.290
<v Speaker 3>you get a very individualist policies,</v>

456
00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:04.920
<v Speaker 3>even though I would say Britain's less individuals than the United States,</v>

457
00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:06.020
<v Speaker 3>it still is a,</v>

458
00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.400
<v Speaker 3>it's way more individualistic than Germans.</v>

459
00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:09.841
<v Speaker 3>Then you've got the French,</v>

460
00:14:09.841 --> 00:14:10.890
<v Speaker 3>which are kind of like a mix.</v>

461
00:14:10.891 --> 00:14:12.510
<v Speaker 3>So they were very individualistic.</v>

462
00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:16.140
<v Speaker 3>Then the lock Ian's last up to the resilience during the French revolution.</v>

463
00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:18.761
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

464
00:14:18.761 --> 00:14:19.594
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

465
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:22.180
<v Speaker 3>Napoleon eventually filled that power vacuum,</v>

466
00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:23.733
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

467
00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:25.420
<v Speaker 3>So you can see the,</v>

468
00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:29.440
<v Speaker 3>you can see the French switch from individualism to imperialism,</v>

469
00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:30.360
<v Speaker 3>which is a,</v>

470
00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:33.860
<v Speaker 3>during the revolution from say the ropes peer,</v>

471
00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:36.190
<v Speaker 3>a peer that was like walking.</v>

472
00:14:36.191 --> 00:14:37.420
<v Speaker 3>So then rose Pierre took over,</v>

473
00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:38.110
<v Speaker 3>he came,</v>

474
00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:39.290
<v Speaker 3>he sort of brought the roof.</v>

475
00:14:39.291 --> 00:14:42.790
<v Speaker 3>Sophia and ideas in and then after that came the polio,</v>

476
00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:43.960
<v Speaker 3>eventually after rubs,</v>

477
00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:48.990
<v Speaker 3>pier was destroyed or had his head chopped off and their policies all changed</v>

478
00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:53.180
<v Speaker 3>and then you get a French empire and they competed with the Russians.</v>

479
00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:55.280
<v Speaker 3>Then eventually he falls because,</v>

480
00:14:55.281 --> 00:14:55.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

481
00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:58.700
<v Speaker 3>all of your allies against them essentially in the pulling on a course.</v>

482
00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:01.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

483
00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:01.883
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting it</v>

484
00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:06.380
<v Speaker 3>history lesson in philosophy and philosophy and how it impacts almost running</v>

485
00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:07.190
<v Speaker 3>out of breath,</v>

486
00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:08.023
<v Speaker 3>but yeah.</v>

487
00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:09.531
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

488
00:15:09.531 --> 00:15:11.440
<v Speaker 3>So basically it's just a in a,</v>

489
00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:12.160
<v Speaker 3>you can't really see.</v>

490
00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.320
<v Speaker 3>You can always start from a particular place because it,</v>

491
00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:17.000
<v Speaker 3>it evolved over time.</v>

492
00:15:17.001 --> 00:15:17.834
<v Speaker 3>All this stuff.</v>

493
00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:21.800
<v Speaker 3>So it's hard to pinpoint when likes a postmodern ideas happen.</v>

494
00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:23.870
<v Speaker 3>But you could say they happened with Kant.</v>

495
00:15:23.871 --> 00:15:28.871
<v Speaker 3>He might've been like the first prototype postmodernist before modernism even</v>

496
00:15:28.881 --> 00:15:29.390
<v Speaker 3>existed.</v>

497
00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:30.590
<v Speaker 3>Like he was the seed of it.</v>

498
00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:32.633
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

499
00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:33.593
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

500
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:37.040
<v Speaker 1>A university I went to a,</v>

501
00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:38.340
<v Speaker 1>she didn't graduate from,</v>

502
00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:39.151
<v Speaker 1>but then I went to,</v>

503
00:15:39.151 --> 00:15:39.981
<v Speaker 1>was it a Catholic?</v>

504
00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:40.814
<v Speaker 1>A salient.</v>

505
00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.960
<v Speaker 1>You'd have a private university and uh,</v>

506
00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:44.890
<v Speaker 1>and was,</v>

507
00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:46.573
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

508
00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:50.220
<v Speaker 1>there were quite a few extra lectures,</v>

509
00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:51.150
<v Speaker 1>extra,</v>

510
00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:53.193
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

511
00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:57.240
<v Speaker 1>things that you could attend a highlighting the words of con.</v>

512
00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:58.170
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

513
00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:01.680
<v Speaker 1>I just remember seeing through the brochures a thing,</v>

514
00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:06.710
<v Speaker 1>extra things that you could attend and a lot of them had to do with a manual.</v>

515
00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:08.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

516
00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:08.843
<v Speaker 1>Ideas.</v>

517
00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:10.413
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

518
00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:11.550
<v Speaker 1>His philosophy.</v>

519
00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:13.710
<v Speaker 3>What was,</v>

520
00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:14.630
<v Speaker 3>when I was in elementary school,</v>

521
00:16:14.631 --> 00:16:18.200
<v Speaker 3>I first came across Canada because we had to do a project on a philosopher in</v>

522
00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:19.100
<v Speaker 3>our philosophy class.</v>

523
00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:20.580
<v Speaker 3>I just chose con.</v>

524
00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:21.740
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the fuck I was doing.</v>

525
00:16:21.741 --> 00:16:22.431
<v Speaker 3>I was like grade eight.</v>

526
00:16:22.431 --> 00:16:24.460
<v Speaker 3>So I just chose count because uh,</v>

527
00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:28.100
<v Speaker 3>no one else chose them and whatever that I learned a little bit about.</v>

528
00:16:28.101 --> 00:16:28.191
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

529
00:16:28.191 --> 00:16:28.930
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>

530
00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:29.170
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

531
00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:33.410
<v Speaker 3>I didn't really care about them until recently where I started listening to the</v>

532
00:16:33.411 --> 00:16:35.540
<v Speaker 3>Steven Hicks and he said,</v>

533
00:16:35.541 --> 00:16:37.340
<v Speaker 3>the way he breaks it down in this book is like,</v>

534
00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:41.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm sort of like the grandfather of the,</v>

535
00:16:41.631 --> 00:16:41.751
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

536
00:16:41.751 --> 00:16:45.740
<v Speaker 3>the German School of philosophy and the from him,</v>

537
00:16:45.741 --> 00:16:50.610
<v Speaker 3>you get like the Eagle who then he gets split off into UC eagles.</v>

538
00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:51.241
<v Speaker 3>A collectivist,</v>

539
00:16:51.241 --> 00:16:52.450
<v Speaker 3>like people believe like a,</v>

540
00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:53.540
<v Speaker 3>the states,</v>

541
00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:55.220
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

542
00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:55.530
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

543
00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:59.140
<v Speaker 3>he believed in the state almost as strongly as fascist to basically astronomers</v>

544
00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.930
<v Speaker 3>fascist do and Marx took those ideas and adapted them to be more,</v>

545
00:17:02.931 --> 00:17:03.490
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

546
00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:05.990
<v Speaker 3>a brew Sonia and I guess you could say,</v>

547
00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:10.850
<v Speaker 3>and you can also see over time how the leftists have abandoned marks to some</v>

548
00:17:10.851 --> 00:17:15.851
<v Speaker 3>degree and started to adopt more resilient ideas of like the noble savage and</v>

549
00:17:15.891 --> 00:17:20.270
<v Speaker 3>stuff like we should go back to the cave days because back then man was so happy</v>

550
00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.800
<v Speaker 3>and wasn't dying of diseases.</v>

551
00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:23.900
<v Speaker 3>And you're being murdered at super high res.</v>

552
00:17:23.901 --> 00:17:24.730
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

553
00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:29.730
<v Speaker 1>So does that like split classes to be extreme or you kind of do away with</v>

554
00:17:29.741 --> 00:17:32.020
<v Speaker 1>glasses and just one class?</v>

555
00:17:32.021 --> 00:17:34.240
<v Speaker 1>The elite versus the peasants?</v>

556
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.100
<v Speaker 3>Who a re Rousseau,</v>

557
00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:40.120
<v Speaker 3>Rousseau.</v>

558
00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:40.581
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we're.</v>

559
00:17:40.581 --> 00:17:42.980
<v Speaker 3>So we're so wanting to get rid of everything.</v>

560
00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:44.480
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

561
00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.390
<v Speaker 3>he wanted to go back to like a tribal society.</v>

562
00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:49.183
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

563
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:50.260
<v Speaker 3>Which is,</v>

564
00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:50.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

565
00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:51.650
<v Speaker 3>you even know if he,</v>

566
00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:52.200
<v Speaker 3>he would.</v>

567
00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.150
<v Speaker 3>He postulated whether or not that was realistic,</v>

568
00:17:54.151 --> 00:17:57.450
<v Speaker 3>but that's what he said would be the ideal state because we couldn't go back to</v>

569
00:17:57.451 --> 00:17:58.290
<v Speaker 3>our animal nature,</v>

570
00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.720
<v Speaker 3>which is sort of like the Adam and Eve story with the fruit.</v>

571
00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:03.413
<v Speaker 6>No</v>

572
00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:05.250
<v Speaker 3>eating from the tree of knowledge and then you know,</v>

573
00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:06.084
<v Speaker 3>you can never go back.</v>

574
00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:08.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's just obviously a metaphor,</v>

575
00:18:08.861 --> 00:18:10.310
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

576
00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.460
<v Speaker 3>an interesting one anyways.</v>

577
00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:14.241
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

578
00:18:14.241 --> 00:18:15.074
<v Speaker 3>I can hear you good.</v>

579
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.831
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

580
00:18:15.831 --> 00:18:17.180
<v Speaker 3>I think the stream just reconnected.</v>

581
00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:17.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

582
00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:18.643
<v Speaker 3>there we go.</v>

583
00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:19.861
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

584
00:18:19.861 --> 00:18:21.000
<v Speaker 3>I wish I had more of an opinion,</v>

585
00:18:21.001 --> 00:18:22.950
<v Speaker 3>but I don't because you know,</v>

586
00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:24.993
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

587
00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:32.080
<v Speaker 3>my retention of a philosophy historically and how it's impacted nations and say</v>

588
00:18:32.901 --> 00:18:35.150
<v Speaker 3>them over and over again because I won't get everything the first time,</v>

589
00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:36.830
<v Speaker 3>like not focused on it.</v>

590
00:18:36.831 --> 00:18:40.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm kind of focusing on other banks but over like we saw like absorbed,</v>

591
00:18:40.141 --> 00:18:40.410
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

592
00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:41.243
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

593
00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:45.260
<v Speaker 3>that all 40 years of my head and then I can kind of talk about them.</v>

594
00:18:45.261 --> 00:18:46.220
<v Speaker 3>But like the,</v>

595
00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:47.390
<v Speaker 3>you know that Jordan Peterson,</v>

596
00:18:47.391 --> 00:18:51.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm with that lecture series of maps of meaning 2017.</v>

597
00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:53.023
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

598
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:55.340
<v Speaker 3>I think I've listened to that like four or five times</v>

599
00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:58.190
<v Speaker 3>the first time listen to that,</v>

600
00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:01.070
<v Speaker 3>but first time I listened to it blew my fucking mind.</v>

601
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:02.660
<v Speaker 3>Like I couldn't,</v>

602
00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:03.070
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

603
00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:03.460
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

604
00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:04.101
<v Speaker 3>it basically,</v>

605
00:19:04.101 --> 00:19:06.590
<v Speaker 3>to me it rationalized religious belief,</v>

606
00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:07.513
<v Speaker 3>like it made it,</v>

607
00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:09.140
<v Speaker 3>it made it make sense,</v>

608
00:19:09.141 --> 00:19:10.580
<v Speaker 3>like in an evolutionary way,</v>

609
00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:11.473
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

610
00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:13.180
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

611
00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:13.480
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

612
00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:14.560
<v Speaker 3>that's still kind of blows my mind.</v>

613
00:19:14.561 --> 00:19:14.961
<v Speaker 3>I'm still around.</v>

614
00:19:14.961 --> 00:19:16.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm still working my way through his book,</v>

615
00:19:16.571 --> 00:19:19.630
<v Speaker 3>but I keep getting sidetracked on other things like starship troopers for</v>

616
00:19:19.631 --> 00:19:20.464
<v Speaker 3>example.</v>

617
00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:21.750
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

618
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:22.583
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

619
00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:23.593
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

620
00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:24.993
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

621
00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:26.020
<v Speaker 3>the first starship troopers,</v>

622
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:27.460
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people have this issue with the,</v>

623
00:19:27.461 --> 00:19:27.691
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

624
00:19:27.691 --> 00:19:28.391
<v Speaker 3>the voting thing,</v>

625
00:19:28.391 --> 00:19:29.224
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

626
00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:30.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

627
00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:31.220
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

628
00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:31.500
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

629
00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:32.333
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

630
00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:33.120
<v Speaker 3>what exactly,</v>

631
00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:33.881
<v Speaker 3>because you have to,</v>

632
00:19:33.881 --> 00:19:34.714
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

633
00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:36.340
<v Speaker 3>you have to commit to service.</v>

634
00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:38.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

635
00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:39.940
<v Speaker 3>You have to do through your service a minimum.</v>

636
00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:40.700
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

637
00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:41.440
<v Speaker 3>and you have to,</v>

638
00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:41.800
<v Speaker 3>I guess,</v>

639
00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:46.300
<v Speaker 3>earn your right to vote by becoming conscious of you're a collective</v>

640
00:19:46.301 --> 00:19:48.070
<v Speaker 3>responsibility or social responsibility.</v>

641
00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:49.550
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

642
00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:51.050
<v Speaker 3>and civilians don't have to deal with that.</v>

643
00:19:51.051 --> 00:19:52.330
<v Speaker 3>And it makes a lot of sense.</v>

644
00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.560
<v Speaker 3>I meant today there's a lot of people that have no,</v>

645
00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:56.830
<v Speaker 3>no clue what they're doing,</v>

646
00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:58.061
<v Speaker 3>which is fine.</v>

647
00:19:58.061 --> 00:19:59.710
<v Speaker 3>I guess with our system,</v>

648
00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:04.920
<v Speaker 3>but it turns into more of a popularity contest then if you,</v>

649
00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:08.080
<v Speaker 3>if you're voting someone else's money into your pocket,</v>

650
00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:09.130
<v Speaker 3>that's not.</v>

651
00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:13.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's just a really open for abuse,</v>

652
00:20:13.331 --> 00:20:14.164
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

653
00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:15.663
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

654
00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:17.430
<v Speaker 3>And for economic prosperity,</v>

655
00:20:17.431 --> 00:20:22.431
<v Speaker 3>you need to have sort of a guarantee of property rights and that totally takes</v>

656
00:20:22.861 --> 00:20:24.210
<v Speaker 3>away from that in some,</v>

657
00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:24.810
<v Speaker 3>in some way.</v>

658
00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:25.380
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

659
00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:30.000
<v Speaker 3>luckily our system has been relatively reasonable and we haven't like quote</v>

660
00:20:30.001 --> 00:20:31.380
<v Speaker 3>unquote eating the rich.</v>

661
00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:32.940
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

662
00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:37.830
<v Speaker 3>you never know with our Kazia Cortez the 70 percent rate that's used proposing,</v>

663
00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:39.473
<v Speaker 3>that's insane.</v>

664
00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:41.820
<v Speaker 3>Like quotes back.</v>

665
00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:45.050
<v Speaker 3>She drove us back to like the 19 forties or whatever they can,</v>

666
00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:46.410
<v Speaker 3>fifties when the rates were that high,</v>

667
00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:46.860
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

668
00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:47.321
<v Speaker 3>back then,</v>

669
00:20:47.321 --> 00:20:50.370
<v Speaker 3>like the American economy was the only one that was still industrialized.</v>

670
00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:52.660
<v Speaker 3>That wasn't like flat into the ground by the war.</v>

671
00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:57.880
<v Speaker 3>So I mean Germany was one of the main industrial nations before the war.</v>

672
00:20:57.881 --> 00:20:58.360
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

673
00:20:58.360 --> 00:20:59.530
<v Speaker 3>And so it was Britain,</v>

674
00:20:59.531 --> 00:21:01.810
<v Speaker 3>but during the war that it kind of flattened everything.</v>

675
00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:03.180
<v Speaker 3>So all of us left with Americans.</v>

676
00:21:03.181 --> 00:21:06.340
<v Speaker 3>So they kind of had a monopoly on industrial production.</v>

677
00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:09.780
<v Speaker 3>So that's the reason why wages were so high and the tax rates for a,</v>

678
00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:13.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm so high because there was the word,</v>

679
00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:14.120
<v Speaker 3>they're gonna move the money to write,</v>

680
00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:15.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

681
00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:18.430
<v Speaker 3>nowadays you just move it to some third world country and build a factory and</v>

682
00:21:18.431 --> 00:21:18.640
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>

683
00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:18.971
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

684
00:21:18.971 --> 00:21:19.781
<v Speaker 3>your money is there now.</v>

685
00:21:19.781 --> 00:21:20.830
<v Speaker 3>So it's not even the state.</v>

686
00:21:20.831 --> 00:21:21.641
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

687
00:21:21.641 --> 00:21:24.760
<v Speaker 3>absolutely good decline of the American economic empire.</v>

688
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:25.221
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

689
00:21:25.221 --> 00:21:26.870
<v Speaker 4>And the age of globalization,</v>

690
00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:27.231
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

691
00:21:27.231 --> 00:21:28.910
<v Speaker 4>that everything's,</v>

692
00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:31.320
<v Speaker 4>all the tables have turned and uh,</v>

693
00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:35.300
<v Speaker 4>companies can just move away or like you said,</v>

694
00:21:35.301 --> 00:21:36.590
<v Speaker 4>industry can just move away.</v>

695
00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:37.370
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

696
00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:39.020
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't have to be centered in the states.</v>

697
00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:40.223
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

698
00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:40.930
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

699
00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:41.190
<v Speaker 3>And you,</v>

700
00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:41.431
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

701
00:21:41.431 --> 00:21:44.000
<v Speaker 3>you can see now like with the way things are in the states.</v>

702
00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:45.400
<v Speaker 3>So like all technology,</v>

703
00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:46.290
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

704
00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:47.290
<v Speaker 3>before trump,</v>

705
00:21:47.291 --> 00:21:50.370
<v Speaker 3>I think trump's really turned some things around but uh,</v>

706
00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:52.090
<v Speaker 3>to some limited degree anyways,</v>

707
00:21:52.091 --> 00:21:55.060
<v Speaker 3>but definitely under Obama it was almost like the economy in the states was</v>

708
00:21:55.061 --> 00:21:57.970
<v Speaker 3>going under a sort of a controlled decline,</v>

709
00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:02.920
<v Speaker 3>which I think is quite a bad idea if you want to win elections,</v>

710
00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:03.813
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

711
00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:05.021
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

712
00:22:05.021 --> 00:22:05.854
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

713
00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.010
<v Speaker 3>I forgot what I was going to say.</v>

714
00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:12.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

715
00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:13.640
<v Speaker 3>sorry I interrupted you there.</v>

716
00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:14.180
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

717
00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:14.430
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

718
00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:15.263
<v Speaker 4>you didn't.</v>

719
00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:16.570
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

720
00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:17.111
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

721
00:22:17.111 --> 00:22:17.440
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

722
00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:17.591
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

723
00:22:17.591 --> 00:22:18.010
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

724
00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:18.843
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

725
00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:22.330
<v Speaker 4>when you mentioned a Kazia Cortez citing,</v>

726
00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:23.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

727
00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:24.430
<v Speaker 4>probably ftrs,</v>

728
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.690
<v Speaker 4>what was it [inaudible] 91 and 96 or whatever percent tax rate.</v>

729
00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:29.380
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

730
00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:31.090
<v Speaker 4>I mean even some of the programs,</v>

731
00:22:31.091 --> 00:22:33.220
<v Speaker 4>social programs that they instituted then,</v>

732
00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:33.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

733
00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:35.740
<v Speaker 4>basically fell flat on their face and,</v>

734
00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:36.521
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

735
00:22:36.521 --> 00:22:37.354
<v Speaker 4>I don't</v>

736
00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:38.891
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

737
00:22:38.891 --> 00:22:40.540
<v Speaker 4>it would be all well and good if,</v>

738
00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:41.403
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

739
00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:43.240
<v Speaker 4>those taxes,</v>

740
00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:43.600
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

741
00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:43.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

742
00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:48.840
<v Speaker 4>there was transparency with what exactly money went to and how it contributed to</v>

743
00:22:50.111 --> 00:22:52.960
<v Speaker 4>a productivity in the economy,</v>

744
00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:55.450
<v Speaker 4>but don't necessarily know that,</v>

745
00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:55.691
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

746
00:22:55.691 --> 00:22:58.210
<v Speaker 4>there isn't any transparency and maybe,</v>

747
00:22:58.540 --> 00:22:59.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

748
00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:00.940
<v Speaker 4>maybe people would be afraid to,</v>

749
00:23:00.941 --> 00:23:01.774
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

750
00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:03.940
<v Speaker 4>to now when I say people,</v>

751
00:23:03.941 --> 00:23:04.774
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

752
00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:05.733
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

753
00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:08.530
<v Speaker 4>anybody who knows</v>

754
00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:14.560
<v Speaker 4>whether it be economists or engineers or exactly how things are being</v>

755
00:23:14.561 --> 00:23:18.760
<v Speaker 4>misappropriated or mishandled or the inefficiencies or the,</v>

756
00:23:18.761 --> 00:23:19.594
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

757
00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:21.970
<v Speaker 4>unproductive or unproductive African,</v>

758
00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:23.223
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

759
00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:24.720
<v Speaker 4>nature of,</v>

760
00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:27.360
<v Speaker 4>of the,</v>

761
00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:27.581
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

762
00:23:27.581 --> 00:23:28.840
<v Speaker 4>the federal government intervening.</v>

763
00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:30.123
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

764
00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:31.083
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

765
00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:32.980
<v Speaker 4>I always thought it was kind of interesting.</v>

766
00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:34.433
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

767
00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:35.780
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

768
00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:36.613
<v Speaker 4>not always.</v>

769
00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:40.930
<v Speaker 4>I had recently started to read one Ralph Nader's books and you know,</v>

770
00:23:40.931 --> 00:23:41.764
<v Speaker 4>basically he,</v>

771
00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:42.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

772
00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:43.203
<v Speaker 4>he</v>

773
00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:46.520
<v Speaker 4>put forth the concept of,</v>

774
00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:48.170
<v Speaker 4>of taxing</v>

775
00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:52.520
<v Speaker 4>that which humans like least,</v>

776
00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:53.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

777
00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:53.630
<v Speaker 4>being,</v>

778
00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:53.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

779
00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:56.890
<v Speaker 4>pollution companies that uh,</v>

780
00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:01.310
<v Speaker 4>basically contribute to,</v>

781
00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:03.173
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

782
00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:04.790
<v Speaker 4>pollution.</v>

783
00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:05.623
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

784
00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:08.960
<v Speaker 4>and I think pothole or 54 had just put out a video,</v>

785
00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:10.130
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

786
00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:15.130
<v Speaker 4>about climate change and how carbon taxes in Australia have actually led to</v>

787
00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:21.650
<v Speaker 4>companies in Australia innovating to the point where they now are saving.</v>

788
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:23.330
<v Speaker 4>They've been able to save money,</v>

789
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:26.180
<v Speaker 4>more money over time than if they had done nothing.</v>

790
00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:27.283
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

791
00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:29.830
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

792
00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:31.880
<v Speaker 4>I should have mentioned this to you before,</v>

793
00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:33.030
<v Speaker 4>but who knows the,</v>

794
00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:34.640
<v Speaker 4>we'd kind of go in this direction,</v>

795
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.190
<v Speaker 4>but that would be kind of something interesting.</v>

796
00:24:37.191 --> 00:24:37.371
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

797
00:24:37.371 --> 00:24:38.204
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

798
00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:39.073
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

799
00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:40.550
<v Speaker 4>so not only did they,</v>

800
00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:41.660
<v Speaker 4>are they saving money,</v>

801
00:24:41.661 --> 00:24:45.050
<v Speaker 4>but they also started recapturing some of their,</v>

802
00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:45.680
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

803
00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:50.060
<v Speaker 4>some of their emissions and I don't know if they were recycling them or,</v>

804
00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:51.733
<v Speaker 4>or what,</v>

805
00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:56.360
<v Speaker 4>but the taxes led to a in innovation,</v>

806
00:24:56.361 --> 00:24:58.190
<v Speaker 4>which makes sense because pressure,</v>

807
00:24:58.510 --> 00:24:58.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

808
00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:03.880
<v Speaker 4>only under pressure or when someone believes that something needs to change,</v>

809
00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:06.500
<v Speaker 4>does it change?</v>

810
00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:07.333
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

811
00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:07.880
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

812
00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:08.090
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

813
00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:08.910
<v Speaker 5>that's true.</v>

814
00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:12.300
<v Speaker 5>But I mean if I hold a gun to your head and I say like drive the car faster when</v>

815
00:25:12.301 --> 00:25:13.134
<v Speaker 5>you're driving the car,</v>

816
00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:14.850
<v Speaker 5>are you going to drive the car faster?</v>

817
00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:15.661
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

818
00:25:15.661 --> 00:25:16.860
<v Speaker 5>But I don't necessarily know that,</v>

819
00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:17.530
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

820
00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:19.300
<v Speaker 8>that uh,</v>

821
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:24.500
<v Speaker 4>that analogizes well with a component.</v>

822
00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:25.393
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

823
00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:26.690
<v Speaker 5>With saying as,</v>

824
00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:27.990
<v Speaker 5>because it's a show of force,</v>

825
00:25:27.991 --> 00:25:28.111
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

826
00:25:28.111 --> 00:25:28.944
<v Speaker 5>Like you're saying like a,</v>

827
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.310
<v Speaker 5>essentially when the state mandates that you do something,</v>

828
00:25:31.311 --> 00:25:31.940
<v Speaker 5>it's like a show.</v>

829
00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:35.570
<v Speaker 5>It's like you're forced to do it and if you don't do it then you're going to</v>

830
00:25:35.571 --> 00:25:36.710
<v Speaker 5>experience violence.</v>

831
00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:40.340
<v Speaker 5>So my knowledge is basically like the government is saying do this or you're</v>

832
00:25:40.341 --> 00:25:41.850
<v Speaker 5>going to be punished like someone's.</v>

833
00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:42.950
<v Speaker 5>And then suddenly you're like,</v>

834
00:25:42.951 --> 00:25:43.131
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

835
00:25:43.131 --> 00:25:45.200
<v Speaker 5>I guess I have to find a way to innovate also,</v>

836
00:25:45.201 --> 00:25:46.034
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to suffer.</v>

837
00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:46.731
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

838
00:25:46.731 --> 00:25:49.190
<v Speaker 5>it's like someone holding a gun to your head and saying like,</v>

839
00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:49.491
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

840
00:25:49.491 --> 00:25:51.130
<v Speaker 5>drive the car faster or something like that.</v>

841
00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:54.560
<v Speaker 5>You might start driving the car faster if you are worried about getting shot.</v>

842
00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:55.150
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

843
00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:56.720
<v Speaker 5>it is kind of a joke,</v>

844
00:25:56.721 --> 00:25:57.340
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

845
00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:58.173
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

846
00:25:58.550 --> 00:25:58.900
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

847
00:25:58.900 --> 00:25:59.733
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

848
00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:01.470
<v Speaker 4>Go ahead.</v>

849
00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:01.730
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

850
00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:02.441
<v Speaker 4>it just,</v>

851
00:26:02.441 --> 00:26:03.274
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

852
00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:05.150
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

853
00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:05.530
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

854
00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:07.150
<v Speaker 4>we had mentioned before,</v>

855
00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:08.043
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

856
00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:11.770
<v Speaker 4>it was something that I speculated on that maybe a,</v>

857
00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.510
<v Speaker 4>and this is kind of a tangent,</v>

858
00:26:13.511 --> 00:26:18.070
<v Speaker 4>but maybe the like the Indians from India</v>

859
00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:22.200
<v Speaker 4>who are now taking up,</v>

860
00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:23.183
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

861
00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:25.460
<v Speaker 8>not taking up but</v>

862
00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:28.640
<v Speaker 4>kind of moving into the tech sector,</v>

863
00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:29.181
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

864
00:26:29.181 --> 00:26:34.181
<v Speaker 4>people coming straight out of southern Asia moving into the text tech sector,</v>

865
00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:36.163
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

866
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.681
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

867
00:26:36.681 --> 00:26:41.180
<v Speaker 4>maybe them having experienced less prosperity,</v>

868
00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:44.770
<v Speaker 4>having come from a poor area,</v>

869
00:26:44.771 --> 00:26:45.570
<v Speaker 4>it really made them,</v>

870
00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:50.570
<v Speaker 4>it was the last bit having a Indians having come from a poor area or an area of</v>

871
00:26:52.471 --> 00:26:54.240
<v Speaker 4>less prosperity has led to them.</v>

872
00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:55.513
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

873
00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:57.240
<v Speaker 4>had lived in motivation,</v>

874
00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:01.430
<v Speaker 4>the motivation of being coming educated and uh,</v>

875
00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:04.050
<v Speaker 4>figuring things out.</v>

876
00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:07.800
<v Speaker 4>So basically the gun to their head was survival.</v>

877
00:27:07.801 --> 00:27:08.520
<v Speaker 4>It was nature.</v>

878
00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:09.353
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't,</v>

879
00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:12.210
<v Speaker 4>it was another conscious entity.</v>

880
00:27:12.211 --> 00:27:13.290
<v Speaker 4>It was just nature.</v>

881
00:27:13.291 --> 00:27:14.124
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

882
00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:15.600
<v Speaker 4>you can,</v>

883
00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:19.380
<v Speaker 4>you can survive in poverty or maybe die.</v>

884
00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:20.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

885
00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:22.950
<v Speaker 4>Or you can educate yourself and you know,</v>

886
00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:24.660
<v Speaker 4>moved to the states and you know,</v>

887
00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:28.200
<v Speaker 4>to what extent that is like the state,</v>

888
00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:32.130
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying you need to pay up.</v>

889
00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:33.840
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

890
00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:34.920
<v Speaker 4>and then thinking,</v>

891
00:27:34.921 --> 00:27:35.131
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

892
00:27:35.131 --> 00:27:36.000
<v Speaker 4>how are we going to do it?</v>

893
00:27:36.001 --> 00:27:37.020
<v Speaker 4>And an engineer,</v>

894
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:40.950
<v Speaker 4>engineers getting together and developing these methods of recapturing the</v>

895
00:27:40.951 --> 00:27:41.490
<v Speaker 4>mission,</v>

896
00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:42.323
<v Speaker 4>emissions,</v>

897
00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:43.710
<v Speaker 4>recycling them.</v>

898
00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:45.030
<v Speaker 4>And then over time,</v>

899
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:45.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

900
00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:46.433
<v Speaker 4>they kind of go,</v>

901
00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:46.840
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>

902
00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:47.673
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

903
00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:49.140
<v Speaker 4>we're saving money now.</v>

904
00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:50.370
<v Speaker 4>Are you able to make more money?</v>

905
00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:52.470
<v Speaker 4>And Yeah.</v>

906
00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:54.840
<v Speaker 3>Oh well that made me think of a,</v>

907
00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:56.660
<v Speaker 3>I might be a result of the WTO,</v>

908
00:27:56.661 --> 00:27:57.800
<v Speaker 3>the World Trade Organization,</v>

909
00:27:57.801 --> 00:27:59.870
<v Speaker 3>like allowing for the markets to be a little more free.</v>

910
00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:01.220
<v Speaker 3>Like for example,</v>

911
00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:04.250
<v Speaker 3>Microsoft or a tech company is might say,</v>

912
00:28:04.251 --> 00:28:04.431
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

913
00:28:04.431 --> 00:28:07.220
<v Speaker 3>it's cheaper to develop this technology in Asia.</v>

914
00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:07.761
<v Speaker 3>So they go,</v>

915
00:28:07.761 --> 00:28:07.971
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

916
00:28:07.971 --> 00:28:12.971
<v Speaker 3>well because of the WTO rules are because of the expanded free markets.</v>

917
00:28:13.071 --> 00:28:14.030
<v Speaker 3>We were going to move there.</v>

918
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:15.950
<v Speaker 3>And that brought opportunity,</v>

919
00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:16.290
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

920
00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:18.410
<v Speaker 3>to the poor Indian people to uh,</v>

921
00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:18.741
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

922
00:28:18.741 --> 00:28:22.280
<v Speaker 3>maybe even get educated for free or for relatively cheap because you're going to</v>

923
00:28:22.281 --> 00:28:23.510
<v Speaker 3>be working for cheap anyways.</v>

924
00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:25.280
<v Speaker 3>And then the best of them say,</v>

925
00:28:25.281 --> 00:28:26.690
<v Speaker 3>well screw this,</v>

926
00:28:26.691 --> 00:28:27.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go to the states,</v>

927
00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:28.310
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

928
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:29.660
<v Speaker 3>Because I can make more money there.</v>

929
00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:35.030
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of it is just due to the opening up markets in terms of like these</v>

930
00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:37.180
<v Speaker 3>developing countries like China for example,</v>

931
00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:38.103
<v Speaker 3>Vietnam.</v>

932
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:38.990
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

933
00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:39.823
<v Speaker 3>it Kinda reminds me,</v>

934
00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:42.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm just gonna step back like a stage here,</v>

935
00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:44.240
<v Speaker 3>but if you don't mind,</v>

936
00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:46.470
<v Speaker 3>but if you imagine a.</v>

937
00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:51.260
<v Speaker 3>When the US started outsourcing production to South Asian countries like</v>

938
00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:55.550
<v Speaker 3>Malaysia and Indonesia and stuff like clothing,</v>

939
00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:56.473
<v Speaker 3>like clothing.</v>

940
00:28:57.130 --> 00:28:58.760
<v Speaker 3>Oh well a lot of people say like,</v>

941
00:28:58.761 --> 00:28:59.151
<v Speaker 3>Oh man,</v>

942
00:28:59.151 --> 00:29:04.151
<v Speaker 3>it's really bad that we outsourced all our production to these countries because</v>

943
00:29:04.671 --> 00:29:06.980
<v Speaker 3>these people work in like slave labor conditions.</v>

944
00:29:06.981 --> 00:29:07.400
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

945
00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.380
<v Speaker 3>Or sweatshop factories and stuff.</v>

946
00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:09.621
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

947
00:29:09.621 --> 00:29:10.454
<v Speaker 3>That was the big,</v>

948
00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:11.260
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

949
00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:11.700
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

950
00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:15.350
<v Speaker 3>the reason that people were protesting in 19 ended three against the WTO,</v>

951
00:29:15.351 --> 00:29:15.920
<v Speaker 3>I believe.</v>

952
00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:17.690
<v Speaker 3>Is that those types of arguments.</v>

953
00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:18.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

954
00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:19.810
<v Speaker 3>And it's true that yeah,</v>

955
00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:22.550
<v Speaker 3>they do suck for a little bit under those conditions,</v>

956
00:29:22.551 --> 00:29:25.940
<v Speaker 3>but the only reason they're working in those conditions at all is because they</v>

957
00:29:25.941 --> 00:29:28.940
<v Speaker 3>would rather work in those conditions and their previous conditions,</v>

958
00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:31.430
<v Speaker 3>which was mostly subsistence farming.</v>

959
00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:32.823
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

960
00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:37.880
<v Speaker 3>So if you can begin to scrape a living by with subsistence farming and your life</v>

961
00:29:38.541 --> 00:29:40.640
<v Speaker 3>is basically like a coin toss,</v>

962
00:29:40.641 --> 00:29:43.210
<v Speaker 3>like it usually renting your land and stuff like your surf.</v>

963
00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:45.490
<v Speaker 3>But if you can get into the factory,</v>

964
00:29:45.491 --> 00:29:48.820
<v Speaker 3>you make twice as much money and it sucks because it's like not in the West but</v>

965
00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:49.541
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

966
00:29:49.541 --> 00:29:52.390
<v Speaker 3>and you're sweating your balls off and whatever and you getting your arms</v>

967
00:29:52.391 --> 00:29:52.991
<v Speaker 3>chopped off,</v>

968
00:29:52.991 --> 00:29:53.411
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

969
00:29:53.411 --> 00:29:54.580
<v Speaker 3>you make a little bit more money,</v>

970
00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:58.870
<v Speaker 3>then you can send your kids to school and gain skills and then slowly over time</v>

971
00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:02.500
<v Speaker 3>you can start demanding more wages and then eventually a demand.</v>

972
00:30:02.501 --> 00:30:03.610
<v Speaker 3>So many wages that they say,</v>

973
00:30:03.611 --> 00:30:03.980
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

974
00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:06.370
<v Speaker 3>we're going to pick a factory up in this other country over here.</v>

975
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:07.450
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

976
00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:10.200
<v Speaker 3>but by that time you've already gained those skills and your infrastructure is</v>

977
00:30:10.201 --> 00:30:11.890
<v Speaker 3>increased because factories need roads,</v>

978
00:30:11.891 --> 00:30:12.701
<v Speaker 3>they need plumbing,</v>

979
00:30:12.701 --> 00:30:14.050
<v Speaker 3>they need electricity,</v>

980
00:30:14.051 --> 00:30:16.060
<v Speaker 3>they need a whole bunch of different things.</v>

981
00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:16.901
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

982
00:30:16.901 --> 00:30:20.170
<v Speaker 3>and those are investments made by the West that made that happen.</v>

983
00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:21.330
<v Speaker 3>So I'll look,</v>

984
00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:22.090
<v Speaker 3>people will.</v>

985
00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:25.510
<v Speaker 3>There is a criticism to say that these people suffer and producting are</v>

986
00:30:25.511 --> 00:30:26.920
<v Speaker 3>producing things for the west.</v>

987
00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:27.940
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

988
00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:30.010
<v Speaker 3>they also pull themselves out of poverty.</v>

989
00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:31.740
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

990
00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:32.573
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

991
00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:34.810
<v Speaker 3>That's a largely happened,</v>

992
00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:35.381
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

993
00:30:35.381 --> 00:30:36.214
<v Speaker 3>As the,</v>

994
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.380
<v Speaker 3>through globalization.</v>

995
00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:42.130
<v Speaker 4>The markets have opened up around the world.</v>

996
00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:47.550
<v Speaker 4>Companies have moved out and have some would argue at the expense of people in</v>

997
00:30:49.151 --> 00:30:50.140
<v Speaker 4>the United States,</v>

998
00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:50.960
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

999
00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:54.820
<v Speaker 4>raised the living standard of poor people around the world.</v>

1000
00:30:57.770 --> 00:30:58.603
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1001
00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:00.623
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1002
00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:01.640
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1003
00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:04.500
<v Speaker 3>I'd saw this comment by Steve Nichols here,</v>

1004
00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:07.380
<v Speaker 3>is this China Mobile execution ban suicide nets.</v>

1005
00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:08.101
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1006
00:31:08.101 --> 00:31:10.850
<v Speaker 3>And I know there's a Canadian recently that just got,</v>

1007
00:31:10.851 --> 00:31:11.040
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1008
00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:13.620
<v Speaker 3>arrests or he was arrested a couple of years ago for drug smuggling,</v>

1009
00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:17.370
<v Speaker 3>a 200 kilograms of methamphetamines or something like that.</v>

1010
00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:18.420
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1011
00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:20.130
<v Speaker 3>he was sentenced to 15 years originally,</v>

1012
00:31:20.131 --> 00:31:20.580
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

1013
00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:21.000
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if,</v>

1014
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.400
<v Speaker 3>I think I heard that he appealed the sentence,</v>

1015
00:31:23.401 --> 00:31:27.260
<v Speaker 3>but apparently it was the state that appealed the sentence and he got retried</v>

1016
00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:30.980
<v Speaker 3>and they recently sent us to death and uh,</v>

1017
00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:32.700
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

1018
00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:36.450
<v Speaker 3>They think it might be a result of us are resting.</v>

1019
00:31:36.451 --> 00:31:37.171
<v Speaker 3>This woman,</v>

1020
00:31:37.171 --> 00:31:38.040
<v Speaker 3>I remember her name.</v>

1021
00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:38.710
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1022
00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:39.543
<v Speaker 3>she works for.</v>

1023
00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:40.051
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1024
00:31:40.051 --> 00:31:42.800
<v Speaker 3>The hallway woman like Vancouver is really close to me and then there's,</v>

1025
00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:46.230
<v Speaker 3>I know it's funny because she owns like a bunch of houses there and like it's</v>

1026
00:31:46.231 --> 00:31:47.064
<v Speaker 3>really a,</v>

1027
00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:50.670
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like a meme that all the houses of Vancouver owned by Chinese</v>

1028
00:31:50.671 --> 00:31:51.450
<v Speaker 3>nationals.</v>

1029
00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:51.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1030
00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:52.291
<v Speaker 3>Because,</v>

1031
00:31:52.291 --> 00:31:52.650
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1032
00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:53.361
<v Speaker 3>we just slide that.</v>

1033
00:31:53.361 --> 00:31:54.480
<v Speaker 3>Anyone buy the houses there,</v>

1034
00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:55.620
<v Speaker 3>that's why the market.</v>

1035
00:31:55.621 --> 00:31:58.110
<v Speaker 3>So one of the reasons the market's so crazy in Vancouver.</v>

1036
00:31:58.800 --> 00:31:59.730
<v Speaker 3>I'll go into that later.</v>

1037
00:31:59.731 --> 00:32:00.700
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

1038
00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:04.560
<v Speaker 3>so they think that might be revenge for the hallway arrest of that.</v>

1039
00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:07.530
<v Speaker 3>A woman that remember going and she's like the daughter of the founder of the</v>

1040
00:32:07.531 --> 00:32:08.364
<v Speaker 3>company.</v>

1041
00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:10.920
<v Speaker 3>She founded the chief financial officer.</v>

1042
00:32:10.921 --> 00:32:11.520
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>

1043
00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:12.360
<v Speaker 3>that's what she is now,</v>

1044
00:32:12.361 --> 00:32:13.194
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1045
00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:13.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1046
00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:14.521
<v Speaker 3>she's the CFO.</v>

1047
00:32:14.521 --> 00:32:15.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1048
00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:16.133
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1049
00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:16.951
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1050
00:32:16.951 --> 00:32:17.220
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1051
00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:17.731
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1052
00:32:17.731 --> 00:32:18.660
<v Speaker 3>I heard about that.</v>

1053
00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:19.770
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1054
00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:21.660
<v Speaker 4>well I read the article on Drudge,</v>

1055
00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:25.080
<v Speaker 4>just pulling things up through drudge and I'm.</v>

1056
00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:25.650
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1057
00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:26.011
<v Speaker 3>well yeah.</v>

1058
00:32:26.011 --> 00:32:31.011
<v Speaker 3>And then she and they were putting a little rice sized spy chips and all Huawei</v>

1059
00:32:31.351 --> 00:32:32.610
<v Speaker 3>products and that,</v>

1060
00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:33.800
<v Speaker 3>those chips were the,</v>

1061
00:32:33.801 --> 00:32:36.780
<v Speaker 3>I guess the interface with the web and would send the data,</v>

1062
00:32:36.781 --> 00:32:38.940
<v Speaker 3>the raw data back to China for the Internet.</v>

1063
00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:43.910
<v Speaker 3>And China was getting old and security secrets.</v>

1064
00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:44.900
<v Speaker 3>That's way kind of like,</v>

1065
00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:48.340
<v Speaker 3>I guess you'd call them spaceships and a,</v>

1066
00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:49.730
<v Speaker 3>the u s is all concerned about,</v>

1067
00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:50.360
<v Speaker 3>we call it the,</v>

1068
00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:50.571
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1069
00:32:50.571 --> 00:32:51.381
<v Speaker 3>the five eyes.</v>

1070
00:32:51.381 --> 00:32:52.250
<v Speaker 3>It's like New Zealand,</v>

1071
00:32:52.251 --> 00:32:52.761
<v Speaker 3>Australia,</v>

1072
00:32:52.761 --> 00:32:53.211
<v Speaker 3>Canada,</v>

1073
00:32:53.211 --> 00:32:53.601
<v Speaker 3>UK,</v>

1074
00:32:53.601 --> 00:32:54.434
<v Speaker 3>USA,</v>

1075
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.460
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

1076
00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:56.390
<v Speaker 3>it's the anglosphere.</v>

1077
00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:56.841
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1078
00:32:56.841 --> 00:32:58.310
<v Speaker 3>we all share spy information.</v>

1079
00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:03.320
<v Speaker 3>Then the US has been pressuring everyone to stop buying qua way a technology.</v>

1080
00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:06.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1081
00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:07.433
<v Speaker 3>Just they haven't been.</v>

1082
00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:10.500
<v Speaker 3>They've embedded like military people inside the company.</v>

1083
00:33:10.501 --> 00:33:11.334
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1084
00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:14.360
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1085
00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:15.230
<v Speaker 3>pretty fucked up there.</v>

1086
00:33:15.231 --> 00:33:16.520
<v Speaker 3>Could be stealing our stream right now.</v>

1087
00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:18.370
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1088
00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:19.830
<v Speaker 3>probably our</v>

1089
00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:24.120
<v Speaker 3>China.</v>

1090
00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:26.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1091
00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:29.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean the value systems are completely different to</v>

1092
00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:32.740
<v Speaker 3>what do you know about the soldier?</v>

1093
00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:33.250
<v Speaker 3>Those,</v>

1094
00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:33.470
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1095
00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:33.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1096
00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:35.410
<v Speaker 3>trying to make some of these knockoff products.</v>

1097
00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:36.770
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1098
00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:37.250
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1099
00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:40.130
<v Speaker 1>in fact I was looking at a saxophone mute.</v>

1100
00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:44.480
<v Speaker 1>It's basically a big white egg ish looking thing that I can put my alto</v>

1101
00:33:44.481 --> 00:33:47.720
<v Speaker 1>saxophone in and pull out and there's a $600,</v>

1102
00:33:47.721 --> 00:33:52.721
<v Speaker 1>one called Esx that I think has made in the states or Europe and then there's a</v>

1103
00:33:56.600 --> 00:34:01.600
<v Speaker 1>$300 one now that has made in China and is hailed as just as good.</v>

1104
00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:03.633
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1105
00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:05.693
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty good.</v>

1106
00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:06.643
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty crazy.</v>

1107
00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:11.480
<v Speaker 1>It's just one of millions of knock off things that China makes.</v>

1108
00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:13.281
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1109
00:34:13.281 --> 00:34:16.220
<v Speaker 3>Well they would make these a retro consoles that uh,</v>

1110
00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:20.810
<v Speaker 3>we can put like download every game ever made for like in 64 [inaudible] and</v>

1111
00:34:20.811 --> 00:34:22.520
<v Speaker 3>lower and uh,</v>

1112
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:23.623
<v Speaker 3>and just like,</v>

1113
00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:24.463
<v Speaker 3>it's like cheap.</v>

1114
00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:27.620
<v Speaker 3>You can get them for like 60 bucks or something like really cheap on Alibaba,</v>

1115
00:34:27.621 --> 00:34:28.070
<v Speaker 3>like 30,</v>

1116
00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:29.300
<v Speaker 3>maybe 30 bucks or USA.</v>

1117
00:34:29.930 --> 00:34:30.763
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

1118
00:34:31.370 --> 00:34:32.121
<v Speaker 3>they were filling.</v>

1119
00:34:32.121 --> 00:34:32.921
<v Speaker 3>Those are the Rom.</v>

1120
00:34:32.921 --> 00:34:33.620
<v Speaker 3>So like that's,</v>

1121
00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:36.110
<v Speaker 3>that's like considered a crime here and Soulja boy,</v>

1122
00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:36.441
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1123
00:34:36.441 --> 00:34:37.430
<v Speaker 3>the rapper or whatever.</v>

1124
00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:40.850
<v Speaker 3>He was trying to market this soldier console,</v>

1125
00:34:40.851 --> 00:34:44.570
<v Speaker 3>which is just like you'd buy the Alibaba version of the console and just write</v>

1126
00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:48.140
<v Speaker 3>soulja boy on it with some sticker and sell it for like 300 bucks.</v>

1127
00:34:48.670 --> 00:34:49.610
<v Speaker 3>And we certainly intend to,</v>

1128
00:34:49.611 --> 00:34:50.870
<v Speaker 3>I guess that time and uh,</v>

1129
00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:52.083
<v Speaker 3>but that's just an example.</v>

1130
00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:53.420
<v Speaker 3>That's what we have to get rid of it.</v>

1131
00:34:53.421 --> 00:34:57.530
<v Speaker 3>But there's an example of China's meddling in our technology,</v>

1132
00:34:57.531 --> 00:34:57.800
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1133
00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:58.633
<v Speaker 3>They just steal it.</v>

1134
00:34:59.390 --> 00:35:00.223
<v Speaker 3>I bet you if we,</v>

1135
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:01.820
<v Speaker 3>if we could cut them off for 10 years,</v>

1136
00:35:01.821 --> 00:35:02.870
<v Speaker 3>they would fall way behind.</v>

1137
00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:05.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1138
00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:08.990
<v Speaker 1>A we'll of course the price,</v>

1139
00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:10.880
<v Speaker 1>the price of goods would.</v>

1140
00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:16.930
<v Speaker 1>If we didn't have any alternative manufacturing could skyrocket.</v>

1141
00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:19.280
<v Speaker 1>And who knows what type of pressure they would put on.</v>

1142
00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:20.061
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1143
00:35:20.061 --> 00:35:22.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how big of a player Taiwan is,</v>

1144
00:35:22.881 --> 00:35:23.714
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

1145
00:35:24.490 --> 00:35:24.671
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1146
00:35:24.671 --> 00:35:25.504
<v Speaker 3>it would definitely be.</v>

1147
00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:28.360
<v Speaker 3>We've definitely experienced price problems,</v>

1148
00:35:28.361 --> 00:35:29.194
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

1149
00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:30.300
<v Speaker 3>like for example,</v>

1150
00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:31.090
<v Speaker 3>if I go sam,</v>

1151
00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:32.500
<v Speaker 3>Samsung a product,</v>

1152
00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:33.730
<v Speaker 3>not South Korea,</v>

1153
00:35:33.731 --> 00:35:38.310
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of products that come now only are only to last like five to 10,</v>

1154
00:35:38.330 --> 00:35:39.870
<v Speaker 3>like five to 10 years maximum.</v>

1155
00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:41.363
<v Speaker 3>I have,</v>

1156
00:35:41.570 --> 00:35:42.121
<v Speaker 3>I have a,</v>

1157
00:35:42.121 --> 00:35:44.430
<v Speaker 3>a Kenmore sears brand,</v>

1158
00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:45.810
<v Speaker 3>a washing machine,</v>

1159
00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:46.990
<v Speaker 3>and it works fine.</v>

1160
00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:47.850
<v Speaker 3>It's from 19,</v>

1161
00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:48.330
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1162
00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:50.930
<v Speaker 3>1989 and I,</v>

1163
00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:53.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking of replacing it because it's kind of ugly looking,</v>

1164
00:35:53.131 --> 00:35:57.480
<v Speaker 3>but it does the job and if I get a pay to replace it then I'm going to get some</v>

1165
00:35:57.620 --> 00:35:59.130
<v Speaker 3>thing that's an elastic five years,</v>

1166
00:35:59.330 --> 00:36:00.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1167
00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:00.923
<v Speaker 3>so I'm Kinda,</v>

1168
00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:02.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm reluctant to get rid of it.</v>

1169
00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:03.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1170
00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:03.770
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1171
00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:04.110
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

1172
00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:04.943
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1173
00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:05.461
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

1174
00:36:05.461 --> 00:36:06.294
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1175
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:07.670
<v Speaker 4>a bit of a tangent,</v>

1176
00:36:07.671 --> 00:36:12.410
<v Speaker 4>but I had just popped in to want to Owen Benjamin streams and he was saying,</v>

1177
00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:12.861
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1178
00:36:12.861 --> 00:36:14.570
<v Speaker 4>you wouldn't replace a,</v>

1179
00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:16.010
<v Speaker 4>you would,</v>

1180
00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:18.710
<v Speaker 4>I forget what he was talking about when you said you wouldn't replace,</v>

1181
00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:19.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1182
00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:21.410
<v Speaker 4>appliances from 50 years ago.</v>

1183
00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:22.461
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>

1184
00:36:22.461 --> 00:36:22.850
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1185
00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:23.121
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1186
00:36:23.121 --> 00:36:23.610
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

1187
00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:24.530
<v Speaker 4>I think I lost you there.</v>

1188
00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:26.451
<v Speaker 4>Well he was saying,</v>

1189
00:36:26.451 --> 00:36:26.601
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1190
00:36:26.601 --> 00:36:27.590
<v Speaker 4>you wouldn't have place,</v>

1191
00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:31.820
<v Speaker 4>you would be dumb to want to replace appliances from 30,</v>

1192
00:36:31.821 --> 00:36:32.361
<v Speaker 4>40,</v>

1193
00:36:32.361 --> 00:36:33.350
<v Speaker 4>50 years ago.</v>

1194
00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:34.750
<v Speaker 4>And I thought to myself like,</v>

1195
00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:35.211
<v Speaker 4>well no,</v>

1196
00:36:35.211 --> 00:36:39.980
<v Speaker 4>that's why I think you're just a little bit ignorant of how things have been</v>

1197
00:36:39.981 --> 00:36:42.920
<v Speaker 4>made and how the quality of things have diminished.</v>

1198
00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:44.113
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

1199
00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:45.103
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

1200
00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:46.481
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1201
00:36:46.481 --> 00:36:47.770
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's just objective,</v>

1202
00:36:47.771 --> 00:36:48.251
<v Speaker 4>really true.</v>

1203
00:36:48.251 --> 00:36:51.040
<v Speaker 4>If you ask any like Hvac technician,</v>

1204
00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:52.333
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1205
00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:54.330
<v Speaker 4>for appliance technician,</v>

1206
00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:55.713
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

1207
00:36:56.110 --> 00:36:59.050
<v Speaker 4>now I wouldn't necessarily when he mentioned his older cars,</v>

1208
00:36:59.051 --> 00:36:59.201
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1209
00:36:59.201 --> 00:37:00.670
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't want to go with an older car.</v>

1210
00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:01.880
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

1211
00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:04.260
<v Speaker 3>but it depends I guess on the model.</v>

1212
00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:06.250
<v Speaker 4>Depends on what you want,</v>

1213
00:37:06.251 --> 00:37:08.410
<v Speaker 4>but I mean for efficiency,</v>

1214
00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:09.541
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1215
00:37:09.541 --> 00:37:11.020
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't go with an older car,</v>

1216
00:37:11.021 --> 00:37:12.430
<v Speaker 4>but efficiency,</v>

1217
00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:13.960
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1218
00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:17.290
<v Speaker 4>not necessarily electrical efficiency in older appliances,</v>

1219
00:37:17.291 --> 00:37:18.071
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

1220
00:37:18.071 --> 00:37:20.530
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to be replacing it for 20,</v>

1221
00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:20.950
<v Speaker 4>30,</v>

1222
00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:21.270
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1223
00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:22.103
<v Speaker 3>four years.</v>

1224
00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:27.650
<v Speaker 3>Know that the whole electrical efficiency thing is like kind of like an a is</v>

1225
00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:28.870
<v Speaker 3>weird anyways.</v>

1226
00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:29.703
<v Speaker 3>Like you know,</v>

1227
00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:30.461
<v Speaker 3>space heaters,</v>

1228
00:37:30.461 --> 00:37:34.690
<v Speaker 3>they're like 99 percent efficient so you can't really get much more efficient</v>

1229
00:37:34.691 --> 00:37:35.524
<v Speaker 3>than that.</v>

1230
00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:38.110
<v Speaker 3>So when they say like an eco friendly or whatever is,</v>

1231
00:37:38.111 --> 00:37:39.520
<v Speaker 3>it usually just means it shittier.</v>

1232
00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:39.930
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1233
00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:40.763
<v Speaker 3>so I found,</v>

1234
00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:42.383
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1235
00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:44.321
<v Speaker 3>I mean not for heaters,</v>

1236
00:37:44.321 --> 00:37:45.330
<v Speaker 3>but like for washing machine,</v>

1237
00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:47.660
<v Speaker 3>I had this washing machine that was supposed to be ecofriendly or you got like</v>

1238
00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:51.700
<v Speaker 3>some kind of rebate from the government for it and got 50 bucks off.</v>

1239
00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:53.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm afraid to a regular one,</v>

1240
00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:56.560
<v Speaker 3>but I just found that didn't wash the clothes,</v>

1241
00:37:56.650 --> 00:37:57.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1242
00:37:57.140 --> 00:37:57.490
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

1243
00:37:57.490 --> 00:37:57.940
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1244
00:37:57.940 --> 00:37:58.481
<v Speaker 3>what's the point?</v>

1245
00:37:58.481 --> 00:37:59.520
<v Speaker 3>If I got to wash them twice,</v>

1246
00:37:59.530 --> 00:37:59.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1247
00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:01.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm not really being that much more efficient,</v>

1248
00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:02.963
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

1249
00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:04.120
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1250
00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:05.380
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't make sense.</v>

1251
00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:07.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1252
00:38:07.210 --> 00:38:08.043
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1253
00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:09.013
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1254
00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:10.173
<v Speaker 3>like there's this.</v>

1255
00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:12.140
<v Speaker 3>I got this.</v>

1256
00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:13.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1257
00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:16.000
<v Speaker 3>Well it's thinking of the environment.</v>

1258
00:38:16.001 --> 00:38:17.230
<v Speaker 3>The thing we were talking about earlier.</v>

1259
00:38:18.490 --> 00:38:19.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1260
00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:19.630
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1261
00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:20.730
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1262
00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:23.860
<v Speaker 3>people like want to like reduce the carbon footprint and stuff.</v>

1263
00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:25.780
<v Speaker 3>I think it was happening in Australia.</v>

1264
00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:26.770
<v Speaker 3>I think that's where it happened.</v>

1265
00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:28.233
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1266
00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:29.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1267
00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:31.780
<v Speaker 3>Well I've been to like,</v>

1268
00:38:31.781 --> 00:38:33.130
<v Speaker 3>I used to be on the side of like,</v>

1269
00:38:33.131 --> 00:38:33.401
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1270
00:38:33.401 --> 00:38:34.211
<v Speaker 3>climate change is bad.</v>

1271
00:38:34.211 --> 00:38:35.410
<v Speaker 3>We've got to fix it like away,</v>

1272
00:38:35.411 --> 00:38:35.920
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1273
00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:37.210
<v Speaker 3>Like we gotta do something about it,</v>

1274
00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:38.470
<v Speaker 3>like revolutionary style.</v>

1275
00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:41.170
<v Speaker 3>Like I used to be kind of a socialist that way and I'm not anymore at all,</v>

1276
00:38:41.171 --> 00:38:41.880
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1277
00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:42.713
<v Speaker 3>I was young.</v>

1278
00:38:42.810 --> 00:38:43.643
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1279
00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:44.493
<v Speaker 3>But anyways,</v>

1280
00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:45.400
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1281
00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:46.300
<v Speaker 3>I used to think that,</v>

1282
00:38:46.301 --> 00:38:46.511
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1283
00:38:46.511 --> 00:38:48.100
<v Speaker 3>well the scientists are saying this,</v>

1284
00:38:48.101 --> 00:38:50.050
<v Speaker 3>so then we should do what the scientists say.</v>

1285
00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:54.790
<v Speaker 3>But then if you look at their models that they show for the climate change,</v>

1286
00:38:55.330 --> 00:38:58.900
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't reflect what we see in our current timeline,</v>

1287
00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:01.180
<v Speaker 3>but maybe there's a correlation at some level.</v>

1288
00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:02.250
<v Speaker 3>But I have,</v>

1289
00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:03.700
<v Speaker 3>I've actually been,</v>

1290
00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:06.100
<v Speaker 3>I've lost my confidence in it,</v>

1291
00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:07.870
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of crazy,</v>

1292
00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:09.970
<v Speaker 3>but I've lost my confidence in their projections.</v>

1293
00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:11.063
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1294
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:11.581
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1295
00:39:11.581 --> 00:39:12.130
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

1296
00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:12.410
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1297
00:39:12.410 --> 00:39:13.090
<v Speaker 3>I talked to,</v>

1298
00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:14.590
<v Speaker 3>I've talked to some people about it,</v>

1299
00:39:14.591 --> 00:39:16.180
<v Speaker 3>like I guess you'd call them hippies,</v>

1300
00:39:16.181 --> 00:39:20.580
<v Speaker 3>maybe the green hippie guys and uh,</v>

1301
00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:22.010
<v Speaker 3>I say stuff as I was talking to him,</v>

1302
00:39:22.011 --> 00:39:22.240
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1303
00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:25.000
<v Speaker 3>so trying to have a rational conversation and they were saying stuff like,</v>

1304
00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:25.301
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1305
00:39:25.301 --> 00:39:28.390
<v Speaker 3>so if we want to have a neutral carbon impact,</v>

1306
00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:33.420
<v Speaker 3>we have to chop down a forest the size of the Indian subcontinent and then bury</v>

1307
00:39:33.521 --> 00:39:34.690
<v Speaker 3>that on the ground every year.</v>

1308
00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:35.860
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1309
00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:38.830
<v Speaker 3>that just doesn't seem like that doesn't seem rational.</v>

1310
00:39:39.090 --> 00:39:40.690
<v Speaker 3>Like that doesn't seem like a real thing,</v>

1311
00:39:41.410 --> 00:39:42.243
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1312
00:39:42.450 --> 00:39:43.560
<v Speaker 3>like the,</v>

1313
00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:47.500
<v Speaker 3>like this logistically speaking like I wouldn't be possible to do.</v>

1314
00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:50.320
<v Speaker 3>And I don't think it makes a lot of sense.</v>

1315
00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:52.990
<v Speaker 3>What do you think of that?</v>

1316
00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:54.520
<v Speaker 3>But I'm not.</v>

1317
00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:57.400
<v Speaker 3>And he said just to remain neutral as we are now,</v>

1318
00:39:57.450 --> 00:39:58.283
<v Speaker 3>that's what we'd have to do.</v>

1319
00:39:59.420 --> 00:39:59.901
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1320
00:39:59.901 --> 00:40:00.700
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1321
00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:01.533
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1322
00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:02.973
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1323
00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:05.620
<v Speaker 4>the whole idea of,</v>

1324
00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:07.310
<v Speaker 4>you mentioned you used to be,</v>

1325
00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:08.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1326
00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:09.770
<v Speaker 4>in favor of revolutionary,</v>

1327
00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:11.233
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

1328
00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:18.390
<v Speaker 4>anthropogenic action to anthropogenic put to what people claim is anthropogenic</v>

1329
00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:20.010
<v Speaker 4>climate change climate,</v>

1330
00:40:20.011 --> 00:40:20.220
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

1331
00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:20.461
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1332
00:40:20.461 --> 00:40:21.040
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't,</v>

1333
00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:22.140
<v Speaker 4>doesn't necessarily.</v>

1334
00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:24.060
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't necessarily,</v>

1335
00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:26.003
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

1336
00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:30.600
<v Speaker 4>it may not necessarily work in a,</v>

1337
00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:30.960
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1338
00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:33.570
<v Speaker 4>I've heard from somebody that,</v>

1339
00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:34.081
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1340
00:40:34.081 --> 00:40:35.190
<v Speaker 4>after nine slash 11,</v>

1341
00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:37.613
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>

1342
00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:38.963
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

1343
00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:42.630
<v Speaker 4>after the planes were grounded for like a week or something like that,</v>

1344
00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:43.973
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1345
00:40:44.130 --> 00:40:45.540
<v Speaker 4>the average temperatures,</v>

1346
00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:49.250
<v Speaker 4>the average temperature a higher,</v>

1347
00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:49.531
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1348
00:40:49.531 --> 00:40:52.410
<v Speaker 4>it got hotter and scientists initially,</v>

1349
00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:54.420
<v Speaker 4>if I'm remembering this correctly,</v>

1350
00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:57.930
<v Speaker 4>were kind of panicking wondering what the hell's going on,</v>

1351
00:40:57.931 --> 00:40:59.100
<v Speaker 4>why is it getting hotter?</v>

1352
00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:00.810
<v Speaker 4>And then they figured out that,</v>

1353
00:41:00.811 --> 00:41:00.991
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1354
00:41:00.991 --> 00:41:03.000
<v Speaker 4>the aerosols that we put into the air,</v>

1355
00:41:03.001 --> 00:41:06.090
<v Speaker 4>the emissions from the planes was,</v>

1356
00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:07.590
<v Speaker 4>is cooling the earth.</v>

1357
00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:09.300
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

1358
00:41:09.301 --> 00:41:10.134
<v Speaker 4>at this point,</v>

1359
00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:10.351
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1360
00:41:10.351 --> 00:41:11.370
<v Speaker 4>they came up with A.</v>

1361
00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:12.450
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if that,</v>

1362
00:41:12.450 --> 00:41:17.370
<v Speaker 4>at that point they came up with the global masking effect of a global,</v>

1363
00:41:17.371 --> 00:41:19.560
<v Speaker 4>a global dimming or aerosol masking effect.</v>

1364
00:41:19.561 --> 00:41:20.640
<v Speaker 4>I forget which it is.</v>

1365
00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:21.690
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1366
00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:22.830
<v Speaker 4>so it seems like,</v>

1367
00:41:22.890 --> 00:41:23.161
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1368
00:41:23.161 --> 00:41:26.520
<v Speaker 4>it's a damned if you do damned if you don't,</v>

1369
00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:27.990
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

1370
00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:29.970
<v Speaker 4>with Australia,</v>

1371
00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:30.973
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1372
00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:32.970
<v Speaker 4>now this is just,</v>

1373
00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:34.100
<v Speaker 4>it's another tangent,</v>

1374
00:41:34.101 --> 00:41:34.970
<v Speaker 4>but somebody in the chat said,</v>

1375
00:41:34.971 --> 00:41:36.140
<v Speaker 4>scientists are forced to lie.</v>

1376
00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:38.090
<v Speaker 4>Carbon tax is a global theft scam.</v>

1377
00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:38.511
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1378
00:41:38.511 --> 00:41:43.511
<v Speaker 4>I don't necessarily know that because the Australians were forced to that,</v>

1379
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.960
<v Speaker 4>those funds that they were being taxed at,</v>

1380
00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:48.590
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1381
00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:52.430
<v Speaker 4>if whoever was taxing them necessarily thought that they were actually going to</v>

1382
00:41:52.431 --> 00:41:53.480
<v Speaker 4>get their shit together,</v>

1383
00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:54.200
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1384
00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:57.350
<v Speaker 4>put their brain power together and develop,</v>

1385
00:41:57.990 --> 00:41:58.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1386
00:41:58.760 --> 00:41:59.750
<v Speaker 4>more innovative</v>

1387
00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:04.640
<v Speaker 4>technology so they could drop their costs,</v>

1388
00:42:04.641 --> 00:42:04.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1389
00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:05.540
<v Speaker 4>maybe the,</v>

1390
00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:06.270
<v Speaker 4>the uh,</v>

1391
00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:07.103
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1392
00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:08.383
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1393
00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:10.213
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1394
00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:11.240
<v Speaker 4>not litigators,</v>

1395
00:42:11.241 --> 00:42:16.241
<v Speaker 4>but the legislators thought that we're just going to get money from them now and</v>

1396
00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:18.771
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1397
00:42:18.771 --> 00:42:20.150
<v Speaker 4>that turned up not being true.</v>

1398
00:42:20.151 --> 00:42:21.030
<v Speaker 4>So I don't know that,</v>

1399
00:42:21.031 --> 00:42:21.210
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1400
00:42:21.210 --> 00:42:21.950
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1401
00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:25.220
<v Speaker 4>I don't know that it is or isn't a global theft scam.</v>

1402
00:42:25.221 --> 00:42:26.660
<v Speaker 4>But there again,</v>

1403
00:42:26.661 --> 00:42:26.901
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1404
00:42:26.901 --> 00:42:28.730
<v Speaker 4>because I don't know,</v>

1405
00:42:28.731 --> 00:42:31.520
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a country in the world where the taxes are,</v>

1406
00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:32.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1407
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:34.640
<v Speaker 4>what you pay is transparent.</v>

1408
00:42:34.641 --> 00:42:36.140
<v Speaker 4>I forget what country,</v>

1409
00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:36.531
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1410
00:42:36.531 --> 00:42:38.030
<v Speaker 4>you can look it all up online,</v>

1411
00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:38.361
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1412
00:42:38.361 --> 00:42:40.160
<v Speaker 4>to what extent that's truthful,</v>

1413
00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:40.611
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1414
00:42:40.611 --> 00:42:40.821
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1415
00:42:40.821 --> 00:42:44.690
<v Speaker 4>I don't know that money's necessarily spent wisely.</v>

1416
00:42:44.691 --> 00:42:45.290
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

1417
00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:48.260
<v Speaker 4>I'm just ignorant of all that and I just want to think tangents.</v>

1418
00:42:48.261 --> 00:42:49.094
<v Speaker 4>But</v>

1419
00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:50.670
<v Speaker 5>I think that the,</v>

1420
00:42:50.671 --> 00:42:51.051
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1421
00:42:51.051 --> 00:42:51.461
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1422
00:42:51.461 --> 00:42:55.180
<v Speaker 5>the way the carbon tax is proposed is it's sort of like,</v>

1423
00:42:55.181 --> 00:42:56.014
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1424
00:42:56.170 --> 00:42:57.640
<v Speaker 5>like a moral tax,</v>

1425
00:42:57.650 --> 00:43:00.670
<v Speaker 5>like you're doing it to help save something.</v>

1426
00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:04.610
<v Speaker 5>But I think the problem with climate change and I think that the.</v>

1427
00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:06.220
<v Speaker 5>Obviously the climate is changing,</v>

1428
00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:09.220
<v Speaker 5>it's just hard to pin down exactly what it is.</v>

1429
00:43:09.221 --> 00:43:13.930
<v Speaker 5>Like there's these correlations and I've heard all the arguments about like,</v>

1430
00:43:13.931 --> 00:43:14.171
<v Speaker 5>oh no,</v>

1431
00:43:14.171 --> 00:43:15.004
<v Speaker 5>it's definitely,</v>

1432
00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:15.550
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1433
00:43:15.550 --> 00:43:16.420
<v Speaker 5>humans or whatever.</v>

1434
00:43:16.421 --> 00:43:18.520
<v Speaker 5>I understand your points,</v>

1435
00:43:18.521 --> 00:43:20.320
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't seem to,</v>

1436
00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:21.413
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1437
00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:23.200
<v Speaker 5>it's not,</v>

1438
00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:27.640
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't convince me because there's a lot of historical records of climate</v>

1439
00:43:27.641 --> 00:43:28.451
<v Speaker 5>changing as well.</v>

1440
00:43:28.451 --> 00:43:31.240
<v Speaker 5>And we weren't burning fossil fuels at those times,</v>

1441
00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:36.310
<v Speaker 5>but all ultimately I think that the question is just so much more complicated</v>

1442
00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:37.173
<v Speaker 5>than,</v>

1443
00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:39.220
<v Speaker 5>than the sort of portrayed it to be.</v>

1444
00:43:39.610 --> 00:43:43.030
<v Speaker 5>And to me that just speaks to it being a little bit that they're being a little</v>

1445
00:43:43.031 --> 00:43:48.031
<v Speaker 5>bit dishonest and I'd rather than be more open about what the reality is rather</v>

1446
00:43:49.181 --> 00:43:50.014
<v Speaker 5>than just saying,</v>

1447
00:43:50.350 --> 00:43:50.741
<v Speaker 5>oh no,</v>

1448
00:43:50.741 --> 00:43:51.730
<v Speaker 5>just trust us,</v>

1449
00:43:51.731 --> 00:43:52.630
<v Speaker 5>we're the experts.</v>

1450
00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:53.410
<v Speaker 5>And that's the,</v>

1451
00:43:53.410 --> 00:43:54.850
<v Speaker 5>if you hear someone say,</v>

1452
00:43:54.851 --> 00:43:55.570
<v Speaker 5>trust us,</v>

1453
00:43:55.570 --> 00:43:56.500
<v Speaker 5>like we're the experts.</v>

1454
00:43:56.501 --> 00:43:58.930
<v Speaker 5>That's like actually a logical fallacy,</v>

1455
00:43:59.390 --> 00:44:00.223
<v Speaker 5>argument,</v>

1456
00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:01.720
<v Speaker 5>argument,</v>

1457
00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:03.100
<v Speaker 5>argument from authority.</v>

1458
00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:04.623
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>

1459
00:44:05.530 --> 00:44:06.970
<v Speaker 5>that doesn't really convince me.</v>

1460
00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:07.360
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1461
00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:08.190
<v Speaker 5>I would,</v>

1462
00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:10.030
<v Speaker 5>I would like to believe them,</v>

1463
00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:10.893
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

1464
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.560
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1465
00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:12.393
<v Speaker 5>have you,</v>

1466
00:44:13.210 --> 00:44:13.391
<v Speaker 5>had,</v>

1467
00:44:13.391 --> 00:44:13.590
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1468
00:44:13.590 --> 00:44:14.141
<v Speaker 5>I had,</v>

1469
00:44:14.141 --> 00:44:14.974
<v Speaker 5>I brought up</v>

1470
00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:21.470
<v Speaker 5>any assignment had I brought up any potholer 54 his videos to you before where</v>

1471
00:44:21.511 --> 00:44:22.344
<v Speaker 5>he basically,</v>

1472
00:44:23.250 --> 00:44:24.001
<v Speaker 5>I just missed that.</v>

1473
00:44:24.001 --> 00:44:24.211
<v Speaker 5>Sorry.</v>

1474
00:44:24.211 --> 00:44:25.650
<v Speaker 5>It was a resolve messed up.</v>

1475
00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:27.750
<v Speaker 4>Had you had,</v>

1476
00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:31.380
<v Speaker 4>I brought up pot full of potholes or 54 to you before.</v>

1477
00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:32.603
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1478
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:38.030
<v Speaker 4>and his basically debunking of the Heritage Foundation's that you've seen on the</v>

1479
00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:39.660
<v Speaker 4>circuit of mainstream media.</v>

1480
00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:45.170
<v Speaker 4>There's a couple of talking heads and a Lord Monckton was one of them and he</v>

1481
00:44:45.931 --> 00:44:47.010
<v Speaker 4>basically takes,</v>

1482
00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:49.470
<v Speaker 4>because he's,</v>

1483
00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:50.520
<v Speaker 4>because he's a journalist,</v>

1484
00:44:50.521 --> 00:44:52.900
<v Speaker 4>he does it effortlessly,</v>

1485
00:44:53.410 --> 00:44:54.243
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1486
00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:59.840
<v Speaker 4>and shows you where they're pulling their data from and how it fits into this</v>

1487
00:45:01.201 --> 00:45:05.670
<v Speaker 4>larger picture and shows you the larger picture all on,</v>

1488
00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:06.301
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1489
00:45:06.301 --> 00:45:07.134
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1490
00:45:07.170 --> 00:45:07.531
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1491
00:45:07.531 --> 00:45:08.364
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1492
00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:09.293
<v Speaker 4>reference.</v>

1493
00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:10.653
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

1494
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:12.103
<v Speaker 7>I don't know the term,</v>

1495
00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:16.950
<v Speaker 4>but the scientific literature literature is the right word.</v>

1496
00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:17.630
<v Speaker 7>But,</v>

1497
00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:18.463
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1498
00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:21.870
<v Speaker 4>and it just,</v>

1499
00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:23.100
<v Speaker 4>I didn't have to go back over it,</v>

1500
00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:23.530
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1501
00:45:23.530 --> 00:45:24.660
<v Speaker 4>to be able to make an argument.</v>

1502
00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:27.000
<v Speaker 4>I'm kind of ignorant so I really shouldn't have an opinion on it.</v>

1503
00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:27.830
<v Speaker 7>But,</v>

1504
00:45:27.830 --> 00:45:28.663
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

1505
00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:30.950
<v Speaker 4>it seems like to me,</v>

1506
00:45:30.951 --> 00:45:31.220
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1507
00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:32.210
<v Speaker 4>I believe that,</v>

1508
00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:33.860
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1509
00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:34.101
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1510
00:45:34.101 --> 00:45:34.390
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1511
00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:37.520
<v Speaker 4>the projections aren't necessarily true.</v>

1512
00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:39.010
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1513
00:45:39.010 --> 00:45:39.340
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1514
00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:39.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1515
00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:40.010
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1516
00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:44.000
<v Speaker 4>I've heard Peterson say that the farther the projections are out because they're</v>

1517
00:45:44.001 --> 00:45:46.130
<v Speaker 4>using what algorithms so using,</v>

1518
00:45:46.570 --> 00:45:47.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1519
00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:47.910
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1520
00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:48.870
<v Speaker 4>estimate estimates.</v>

1521
00:45:49.370 --> 00:45:49.551
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1522
00:45:49.551 --> 00:45:54.551
<v Speaker 4>They're using a basically algorithmic models to project out and they don't.</v>

1523
00:45:56.170 --> 00:45:57.003
<v Speaker 4>And the,</v>

1524
00:45:57.320 --> 00:46:00.260
<v Speaker 4>all the data doesn't necessarily know it's static.</v>

1525
00:46:00.261 --> 00:46:00.591
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

1526
00:46:00.591 --> 00:46:02.900
<v Speaker 4>I don't necessarily know that these algorithms,</v>

1527
00:46:02.901 --> 00:46:03.860
<v Speaker 4>they're not dynamic.</v>

1528
00:46:03.861 --> 00:46:04.330
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1529
00:46:04.330 --> 00:46:05.420
<v Speaker 4>you put input in,</v>

1530
00:46:05.421 --> 00:46:06.380
<v Speaker 4>you get output out,</v>

1531
00:46:06.770 --> 00:46:11.570
<v Speaker 4>you can't put input in and then factor in all these wherever you can.</v>

1532
00:46:11.571 --> 00:46:11.720
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

1533
00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:13.670
<v Speaker 4>maybe I don't understand how algorithms work.</v>

1534
00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:14.853
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1535
00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:17.900
<v Speaker 4>it was almost like trying to like regulate the market,</v>

1536
00:46:17.901 --> 00:46:18.081
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1537
00:46:18.081 --> 00:46:20.690
<v Speaker 4>Like it's just so many inputs and outputs,</v>

1538
00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:21.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1539
00:46:21.330 --> 00:46:23.360
<v Speaker 4>you don't really know if you've made a mistake.</v>

1540
00:46:23.361 --> 00:46:24.410
<v Speaker 4>Where did you make the mistake?</v>

1541
00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:25.243
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1542
00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:26.703
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1543
00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:30.080
<v Speaker 4>I'm just knows optimistically skeptical.</v>

1544
00:46:30.081 --> 00:46:30.590
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1545
00:46:30.590 --> 00:46:31.000
<v Speaker 4>she,</v>

1546
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:31.430
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1547
00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:32.990
<v Speaker 4>whoever that spirit are here,</v>

1548
00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:37.190
<v Speaker 4>but they mentioned the Bjorn Lundberg's a documentary.</v>

1549
00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:42.530
<v Speaker 4>I just listened to a talk a talk with a human Jordan Peterson and it really</v>

1550
00:46:42.531 --> 00:46:47.531
<v Speaker 4>changed my perspective on the whole climate change issue because a pound for</v>

1551
00:46:47.991 --> 00:46:51.710
<v Speaker 4>pound or dollar for dollar you can make a lot more impact,</v>

1552
00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:52.730
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1553
00:46:52.730 --> 00:46:54.260
<v Speaker 4>on human suffering.</v>

1554
00:46:54.650 --> 00:46:57.740
<v Speaker 4>If you say put money in one place versus another.</v>

1555
00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:02.300
<v Speaker 4>And climate change is like one that's way down the list that you could do to</v>

1556
00:47:02.301 --> 00:47:03.380
<v Speaker 4>make the world a better place.</v>

1557
00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:05.503
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1558
00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:06.710
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1559
00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:07.190
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

1560
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.311
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1561
00:47:07.311 --> 00:47:08.630
<v Speaker 4>but he's,</v>

1562
00:47:08.631 --> 00:47:09.020
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

1563
00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:13.440
<v Speaker 4>I think he's onto something there and I think he's very convincing to a because</v>

1564
00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:14.200
<v Speaker 4>it makes it,</v>

1565
00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:15.800
<v Speaker 4>it's the climate change argument is,</v>

1566
00:47:15.801 --> 00:47:16.121
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1567
00:47:16.121 --> 00:47:19.100
<v Speaker 4>let's save all the poor people that are drowning in the rising oceans,</v>

1568
00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:20.180
<v Speaker 4>but realistically,</v>

1569
00:47:20.181 --> 00:47:20.511
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1570
00:47:20.511 --> 00:47:21.950
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot more things we can do.</v>

1571
00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:22.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1572
00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:23.510
<v Speaker 4>I don't think the,</v>

1573
00:47:23.511 --> 00:47:23.811
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1574
00:47:23.811 --> 00:47:25.910
<v Speaker 4>the rising oceans are too serious too.</v>

1575
00:47:25.911 --> 00:47:27.390
<v Speaker 4>Some of the climatologists like a,</v>

1576
00:47:27.650 --> 00:47:32.200
<v Speaker 4>there's a climatologist Paul Beck with out of Ottawa that I listened to whenever</v>

1577
00:47:32.201 --> 00:47:35.770
<v Speaker 4>he puts out new videos and he has a problem with,</v>

1578
00:47:35.850 --> 00:47:36.100
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1579
00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:40.000
<v Speaker 4>some of the models and the problem that I've noticed with him.</v>

1580
00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:41.373
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1581
00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:45.220
<v Speaker 4>the problem that he has that I've noticed is some of the models,</v>

1582
00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:45.810
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

1583
00:47:45.810 --> 00:47:48.520
<v Speaker 4>they're not as specific as you'd like them to be.</v>

1584
00:47:48.521 --> 00:47:50.680
<v Speaker 4>They don't go back as many years as they should.</v>

1585
00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:51.440
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1586
00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:53.020
<v Speaker 4>and because I can't reference anything,</v>

1587
00:47:53.021 --> 00:47:53.741
<v Speaker 4>what I'm saying is,</v>

1588
00:47:53.741 --> 00:47:54.574
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1589
00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:55.750
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't even matter,</v>

1590
00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:56.913
<v Speaker 4>but I mean,</v>

1591
00:47:57.130 --> 00:47:59.770
<v Speaker 4>if you watch some of Paul beckwith's,</v>

1592
00:48:00.070 --> 00:48:01.420
<v Speaker 4>a newer videos,</v>

1593
00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:02.560
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1594
00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:02.891
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1595
00:48:02.891 --> 00:48:03.724
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1596
00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:08.290
<v Speaker 4>he's basically talking about these atmosphere of models and a,</v>

1597
00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:13.390
<v Speaker 4>him just wishing that they were designed better,</v>

1598
00:48:13.391 --> 00:48:15.880
<v Speaker 4>that they should be designed better because they would give you a better</v>

1599
00:48:15.881 --> 00:48:18.400
<v Speaker 4>indication of what they actually mean.</v>

1600
00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:19.583
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1601
00:48:20.110 --> 00:48:20.760
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

1602
00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:21.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1603
00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:21.220
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

1604
00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:22.053
<v Speaker 4>he himself,</v>

1605
00:48:22.450 --> 00:48:24.820
<v Speaker 4>I think he's mentioned that,</v>

1606
00:48:24.821 --> 00:48:25.450
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1607
00:48:25.450 --> 00:48:25.661
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1608
00:48:25.661 --> 00:48:29.680
<v Speaker 4>he and Paul Beckwith is a firm believer in geoengineering.</v>

1609
00:48:29.850 --> 00:48:30.683
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1610
00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:31.953
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1611
00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:32.450
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1612
00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:33.970
<v Speaker 4>it makes sense that as,</v>

1613
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:34.241
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1614
00:48:34.241 --> 00:48:38.740
<v Speaker 4>if these carbon taxes do force companies to innovate,</v>

1615
00:48:38.770 --> 00:48:43.300
<v Speaker 4>if you take out aerosols from the air according to these climatologists</v>

1616
00:48:43.301 --> 00:48:44.134
<v Speaker 4>arguments,</v>

1617
00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:44.830
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1618
00:48:44.830 --> 00:48:46.330
<v Speaker 4>and the global,</v>

1619
00:48:46.750 --> 00:48:48.310
<v Speaker 4>the global masking effect,</v>

1620
00:48:48.311 --> 00:48:49.144
<v Speaker 4>the Aerosol,</v>

1621
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:53.530
<v Speaker 4>the global dimming effect or the aerosol masking effect.</v>

1622
00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:54.713
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1623
00:48:54.730 --> 00:48:55.001
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1624
00:48:55.001 --> 00:48:58.210
<v Speaker 4>you make the Earth Cooler and if you take these aerosols out,</v>

1625
00:48:58.240 --> 00:48:59.170
<v Speaker 4>you take pollution out,</v>

1626
00:48:59.650 --> 00:49:01.510
<v Speaker 4>the earth heats up.</v>

1627
00:49:01.930 --> 00:49:02.201
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1628
00:49:02.201 --> 00:49:02.620
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1629
00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:05.810
<v Speaker 4>that that's a and these,</v>

1630
00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:06.161
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1631
00:49:06.161 --> 00:49:09.910
<v Speaker 4>that wasn't necessarily a model that it's not something that,</v>

1632
00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:13.300
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think that should be tested again.</v>

1633
00:49:13.370 --> 00:49:18.370
<v Speaker 4>I mean to what extent it was enough definitive proof.</v>

1634
00:49:20.650 --> 00:49:21.400
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

1635
00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:22.233
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>

1636
00:49:22.350 --> 00:49:23.440
<v Speaker 4>but to scientists,</v>

1637
00:49:23.441 --> 00:49:27.490
<v Speaker 4>it was really weird after nine slash 11 when all the planes are grounded and</v>

1638
00:49:27.491 --> 00:49:27.791
<v Speaker 4>then,</v>

1639
00:49:27.791 --> 00:49:28.624
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1640
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:33.630
<v Speaker 4>United States that are the global average temperature shot up and uh,</v>

1641
00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:34.521
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1642
00:49:34.521 --> 00:49:34.700
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1643
00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:37.760
<v Speaker 4>they coined that I think around that time</v>

1644
00:49:39.850 --> 00:49:40.120
<v Speaker 4>and he,</v>

1645
00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:41.080
<v Speaker 4>I guess like I said,</v>

1646
00:49:41.390 --> 00:49:45.160
<v Speaker 4>Paul Beck with is a firm believer in or engineering and I don't necessarily</v>

1647
00:49:45.161 --> 00:49:45.994
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

1648
00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:46.953
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1649
00:49:47.770 --> 00:49:49.450
<v Speaker 4>what that means and you know,</v>

1650
00:49:49.451 --> 00:49:51.730
<v Speaker 4>what affects those could have,</v>

1651
00:49:51.790 --> 00:49:52.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1652
00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:53.690
<v Speaker 4>what those,</v>

1653
00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:55.290
<v Speaker 4>whatever particulates they,</v>

1654
00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:59.020
<v Speaker 4>they plan on how they'll administer that,</v>

1655
00:49:59.021 --> 00:49:59.291
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1656
00:49:59.291 --> 00:50:01.480
<v Speaker 4>it's just um,</v>

1657
00:50:02.050 --> 00:50:02.883
<v Speaker 4>but there's a target,</v>

1658
00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:05.120
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of climatologists I believe in June.</v>

1659
00:50:05.130 --> 00:50:06.110
<v Speaker 4>It jus engineering.</v>

1660
00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:07.390
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1661
00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:08.223
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

1662
00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:09.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1663
00:50:09.370 --> 00:50:09.611
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1664
00:50:09.611 --> 00:50:10.930
<v Speaker 4>I totally understand.</v>

1665
00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:12.101
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1666
00:50:12.101 --> 00:50:17.101
<v Speaker 4>I don't totally understand Bjorn Lawnburg I didn't see the whole a video,</v>

1667
00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:19.241
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

1668
00:50:19.241 --> 00:50:23.890
<v Speaker 4>it makes sense that if you want to improve humanity that maybe you should,</v>

1669
00:50:24.290 --> 00:50:25.060
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1670
00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:26.260
<v Speaker 4>that yes,</v>

1671
00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:28.670
<v Speaker 4>other things are more important necessarily</v>

1672
00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:32.120
<v Speaker 3>than trying to deal with climate change.</v>

1673
00:50:32.121 --> 00:50:34.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean it seems like we don't have a full.</v>

1674
00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:38.000
<v Speaker 3>We don't have a full handle on the data yet.</v>

1675
00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:39.140
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's no,</v>

1676
00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:42.673
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1677
00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:46.910
<v Speaker 3>And the funny thing too is if you had mentioned like the fact that the data is</v>

1678
00:50:46.911 --> 00:50:48.070
<v Speaker 3>not really a,</v>

1679
00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:51.290
<v Speaker 3>I guess you could say exclusively inconclusive,</v>

1680
00:50:51.730 --> 00:50:54.950
<v Speaker 3>then they call you some sort of a denier.</v>

1681
00:50:54.951 --> 00:50:55.784
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1682
00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:57.680
<v Speaker 3>But the thing is when you seek,</v>

1683
00:50:57.980 --> 00:50:59.570
<v Speaker 3>when we want to know the truth,</v>

1684
00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:00.830
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1685
00:51:00.830 --> 00:51:02.480
<v Speaker 3>I guess that's what everyone says,</v>

1686
00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:04.850
<v Speaker 3>if you're denying their sort of ideological position.</v>

1687
00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:07.070
<v Speaker 3>And I think this climate change things almost,</v>

1688
00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:12.280
<v Speaker 3>it takes on like a flavor of like almost like religion but not like the good</v>

1689
00:51:12.291 --> 00:51:13.011
<v Speaker 3>parts of religion,</v>

1690
00:51:13.011 --> 00:51:13.940
<v Speaker 3>just like the dogma.</v>

1691
00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:14.921
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1692
00:51:14.921 --> 00:51:15.754
<v Speaker 3>so I have,</v>

1693
00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:17.840
<v Speaker 3>so I have this theory,</v>

1694
00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:20.540
<v Speaker 3>I kind of have to go into it to explain what I'm getting to with this climate</v>

1695
00:51:20.541 --> 00:51:21.320
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

1696
00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:21.890
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1697
00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:26.270
<v Speaker 3>so you have it with religion and all really ideological belief systems.</v>

1698
00:51:26.271 --> 00:51:30.740
<v Speaker 3>You have the dogmatists and he had the spiritualists and uh,</v>

1699
00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:31.760
<v Speaker 3>the spiritualists,</v>

1700
00:51:31.850 --> 00:51:32.683
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1701
00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:34.640
<v Speaker 3>I guess this is kind of,</v>

1702
00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:36.380
<v Speaker 3>I kind of took this from Peterson,</v>

1703
00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:37.550
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1704
00:51:37.550 --> 00:51:38.300
<v Speaker 3>so the documents,</v>

1705
00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:39.770
<v Speaker 3>they really care about the structure,</v>

1706
00:51:39.771 --> 00:51:40.160
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1707
00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:43.700
<v Speaker 3>And they care about order and they care about the 10 product.</v>

1708
00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:44.651
<v Speaker 3>Then you have the spiritual,</v>

1709
00:51:44.651 --> 00:51:49.651
<v Speaker 3>it's that kind of like more cared about the trend or the metaphor or like if you</v>

1710
00:51:50.931 --> 00:51:52.130
<v Speaker 3>were to break it down politically.</v>

1711
00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:55.970
<v Speaker 3>We live in a liberal society mostly,</v>

1712
00:51:56.150 --> 00:52:00.500
<v Speaker 3>and we have liberals on the left and we have conservatives on the right.</v>

1713
00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:02.630
<v Speaker 3>And that's the two wings of liberalism.</v>

1714
00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:03.801
<v Speaker 3>The spiritual,</v>

1715
00:52:03.801 --> 00:52:06.770
<v Speaker 3>the liberals are the spiritualists and the conservative side is the,</v>

1716
00:52:06.771 --> 00:52:06.921
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1717
00:52:06.921 --> 00:52:11.921
<v Speaker 3>the dogmatist and you need both because if you don't have,</v>

1718
00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:14.480
<v Speaker 3>if you go full spiritual,</v>

1719
00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:16.400
<v Speaker 3>you become like fundamentalist,</v>

1720
00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:17.293
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1721
00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:19.430
<v Speaker 3>You can become so chaotic that,</v>

1722
00:52:21.770 --> 00:52:23.480
<v Speaker 3>that nothing that,</v>

1723
00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:25.490
<v Speaker 3>that structure breaks down essentially.</v>

1724
00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:27.200
<v Speaker 3>And if you go too dogmatic,</v>

1725
00:52:27.201 --> 00:52:28.670
<v Speaker 3>you can be freer.</v>

1726
00:52:28.671 --> 00:52:29.390
<v Speaker 3>Society.</v>

1727
00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:30.740
<v Speaker 3>So you don't adapt,</v>

1728
00:52:30.741 --> 00:52:33.800
<v Speaker 3>you're not adapting to change and society starts changing.</v>

1729
00:52:33.801 --> 00:52:34.634
<v Speaker 3>You need to adapt.</v>

1730
00:52:35.350 --> 00:52:36.183
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1731
00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:38.480
<v Speaker 3>so with these climate scientists,</v>

1732
00:52:38.570 --> 00:52:39.170
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1733
00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:44.170
<v Speaker 3>at some point they were spiritualists because they believed in doing something</v>

1734
00:52:44.450 --> 00:52:45.260
<v Speaker 3>to better,</v>

1735
00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:45.800
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1736
00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:46.633
<v Speaker 3>to adapt,</v>

1737
00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:50.690
<v Speaker 3>but at some point they adopted a more dogmatic,</v>

1738
00:52:51.010 --> 00:52:52.210
<v Speaker 3>a s,</v>

1739
00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:54.140
<v Speaker 3>a good spirit but,</v>

1740
00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:57.890
<v Speaker 3>or a dogmatic way of being a in terms of their ideology.</v>

1741
00:52:58.100 --> 00:53:00.180
<v Speaker 3>And now if you even doubt it,</v>

1742
00:53:00.181 --> 00:53:03.950
<v Speaker 3>it's like you're doubting the existence of God if you're a Catholic,</v>

1743
00:53:03.951 --> 00:53:04.161
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1744
00:53:04.161 --> 00:53:04.994
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1745
00:53:05.770 --> 00:53:06.390
<v Speaker 3>it's that,</v>

1746
00:53:06.390 --> 00:53:07.580
<v Speaker 3>that intends to these people.</v>

1747
00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:10.880
<v Speaker 3>So that's where I think they've said at some point that happened.</v>

1748
00:53:10.881 --> 00:53:11.630
<v Speaker 3>I haven't been,</v>

1749
00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:15.140
<v Speaker 3>I haven't pinpointed down to who do you mean?</v>

1750
00:53:16.270 --> 00:53:17.000
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1751
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:17.451
<v Speaker 3>who do you mean?</v>

1752
00:53:17.451 --> 00:53:17.990
<v Speaker 3>Like for who?</v>

1753
00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:19.610
<v Speaker 3>Who would be the spiritualists?</v>

1754
00:53:19.790 --> 00:53:20.061
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1755
00:53:20.061 --> 00:53:21.880
<v Speaker 3>because the climatologists that I listened to,</v>

1756
00:53:21.881 --> 00:53:22.820
<v Speaker 3>you don't really,</v>

1757
00:53:23.710 --> 00:53:24.340
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1758
00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:24.990
<v Speaker 3>there's only,</v>

1759
00:53:24.990 --> 00:53:25.823
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

1760
00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:26.693
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>

1761
00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:27.210
<v Speaker 4>sorry,</v>

1762
00:53:27.210 --> 00:53:31.390
<v Speaker 4>I can't say climate Tajik because not all climatologists but the like Potholer,</v>

1763
00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:32.800
<v Speaker 4>I mean they don't,</v>

1764
00:53:33.310 --> 00:53:37.360
<v Speaker 4>they just basically Kinda will refer to the,</v>

1765
00:53:37.570 --> 00:53:40.180
<v Speaker 4>refer to the literature and right off,</v>

1766
00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:41.800
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1767
00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:46.270
<v Speaker 4>until there's evidence or until somebody can actually make an argument.</v>

1768
00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:49.780
<v Speaker 4>I'm a correct one where,</v>

1769
00:53:49.781 --> 00:53:50.614
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1770
00:53:50.650 --> 00:53:51.483
<v Speaker 4>because a lot of the,</v>

1771
00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:56.020
<v Speaker 4>a lot of the people who are claiming that it's not real</v>

1772
00:53:57.900 --> 00:54:02.900
<v Speaker 4>aren't even citing the data that is put out already properly.</v>

1773
00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:03.551
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1774
00:54:03.551 --> 00:54:08.551
<v Speaker 4>the data's already being misinterpreted and mishandled by the people when you</v>

1775
00:54:09.761 --> 00:54:10.594
<v Speaker 4>see the mainstream,</v>

1776
00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:12.160
<v Speaker 4>when you see it in the mainstream media,</v>

1777
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:13.463
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1778
00:54:14.170 --> 00:54:17.340
<v Speaker 4>immediately it's being mishandled it,</v>

1779
00:54:17.370 --> 00:54:19.180
<v Speaker 4>so it's not even there.</v>

1780
00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:23.950
<v Speaker 4>So it's like the people who were saying that it's like flat,</v>

1781
00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:27.190
<v Speaker 4>like who were saying it's not real,</v>

1782
00:54:28.180 --> 00:54:31.510
<v Speaker 4>aren't even using the correct data.</v>

1783
00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:32.290
<v Speaker 4>Are you there?</v>

1784
00:54:32.290 --> 00:54:37.290
<v Speaker 4>Straw manning what has always been considered a climate change?</v>

1785
00:54:38.501 --> 00:54:40.450
<v Speaker 4>It was a theory that was a,</v>

1786
00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:42.753
<v Speaker 4>it was a,</v>

1787
00:54:43.530 --> 00:54:46.930
<v Speaker 4>a theory that was proposed I think in the late 19th century.</v>

1788
00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:50.733
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1789
00:54:50.890 --> 00:54:52.880
<v Speaker 4>and so if there's just,</v>

1790
00:54:53.310 --> 00:54:54.143
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1791
00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:55.330
<v Speaker 4>it seems like it's,</v>

1792
00:54:55.331 --> 00:54:56.950
<v Speaker 4>there's just a lot of wrong.</v>

1793
00:55:00.690 --> 00:55:01.523
<v Speaker 4>I Dunno,</v>

1794
00:55:01.710 --> 00:55:02.300
<v Speaker 4>I don't want,</v>

1795
00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:02.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1796
00:55:02.970 --> 00:55:07.680
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if I wouldn't say the scientist are necessarily like a spiritualist</v>

1797
00:55:07.681 --> 00:55:08.270
<v Speaker 4>themselves,</v>

1798
00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:08.730
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1799
00:55:08.730 --> 00:55:09.990
<v Speaker 4>or document this,</v>

1800
00:55:10.180 --> 00:55:10.510
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1801
00:55:10.510 --> 00:55:13.010
<v Speaker 4>but I think a lot of the followers grow.</v>

1802
00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:13.531
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1803
00:55:13.531 --> 00:55:14.250
<v Speaker 4>definitely.</v>

1804
00:55:14.250 --> 00:55:14.470
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1805
00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:17.880
<v Speaker 4>I agree with you wholeheartedly there.</v>

1806
00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:19.620
<v Speaker 4>And that's a problem too,</v>

1807
00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:20.633
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1808
00:55:21.090 --> 00:55:21.391
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1809
00:55:21.391 --> 00:55:23.730
<v Speaker 4>that's like you'd probably run in,</v>

1810
00:55:23.790 --> 00:55:25.020
<v Speaker 4>you've probably run into people like that,</v>

1811
00:55:25.021 --> 00:55:29.230
<v Speaker 4>like in her daily goal in your life or just like they were like,</v>

1812
00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:29.461
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1813
00:55:29.461 --> 00:55:32.790
<v Speaker 4>this is the truth and this is the truth as I see it.</v>

1814
00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:34.170
<v Speaker 4>And if you don't agree,</v>

1815
00:55:34.171 --> 00:55:36.120
<v Speaker 4>then you're a bad person and you're immoral.</v>

1816
00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:36.841
<v Speaker 4>Honestly,</v>

1817
00:55:36.841 --> 00:55:37.441
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

1818
00:55:37.441 --> 00:55:39.010
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think</v>

1819
00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:42.451
<v Speaker 4>I've had that happen.</v>

1820
00:55:42.451 --> 00:55:44.100
<v Speaker 4>It's like walking on eggshells around these people.</v>

1821
00:55:44.101 --> 00:55:44.934
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

1822
00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:45.420
<v Speaker 4>probably,</v>

1823
00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:47.580
<v Speaker 4>if I was in Chicago that would happen a whole lot more,</v>

1824
00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:48.473
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

1825
00:55:48.570 --> 00:55:49.160
<v Speaker 4>You don't know.</v>

1826
00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:49.321
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1827
00:55:49.321 --> 00:55:50.310
<v Speaker 4>I take that back,</v>

1828
00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:51.000
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1829
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:56.000
<v Speaker 4>that is the case sometimes that there's very few very few issues.</v>

1830
00:55:58.080 --> 00:56:00.450
<v Speaker 4>I just think everything is murky around it.</v>

1831
00:56:01.050 --> 00:56:01.691
<v Speaker 4>It might happen,</v>

1832
00:56:01.691 --> 00:56:02.850
<v Speaker 4>it might happen more to me,</v>

1833
00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:04.820
<v Speaker 4>11 of stuff,</v>

1834
00:56:05.210 --> 00:56:06.043
<v Speaker 4>frankly closer,</v>

1835
00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:08.790
<v Speaker 4>but might happen more to me because I live on Vancouver Island and it's</v>

1836
00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:10.170
<v Speaker 4>notoriously full of hippies.</v>

1837
00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:12.450
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1838
00:56:12.450 --> 00:56:13.000
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

1839
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:13.833
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1840
00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:17.730
<v Speaker 4>and I think maybe that might have had something to do with it,</v>

1841
00:56:18.270 --> 00:56:19.800
<v Speaker 4>but I was.</v>

1842
00:56:19.810 --> 00:56:21.900
<v Speaker 4>Maybe in Florida it's not so bad or I live,</v>

1843
00:56:21.901 --> 00:56:25.540
<v Speaker 4>it's just this like hippies and lumberjacks and then you go like some stuff in</v>

1844
00:56:25.541 --> 00:56:25.841
<v Speaker 4>between.</v>

1845
00:56:25.841 --> 00:56:27.340
<v Speaker 4>But those are the main two populations.</v>

1846
00:56:27.850 --> 00:56:28.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1847
00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:28.750
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1848
00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:29.021
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1849
00:56:29.021 --> 00:56:32.590
<v Speaker 4>if you were to bring up Christianity in any way and try and challenge that,</v>

1850
00:56:32.591 --> 00:56:34.000
<v Speaker 4>that would be a big thing in the south.</v>

1851
00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:35.540
<v Speaker 4>You get a lot of uh,</v>

1852
00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:35.890
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1853
00:56:35.890 --> 00:56:36.190
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>

1854
00:56:36.190 --> 00:56:38.460
<v Speaker 4>the truth said,</v>

1855
00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:39.170
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1856
00:56:39.170 --> 00:56:40.003
<v Speaker 4>what do you mean?</v>

1857
00:56:40.110 --> 00:56:40.943
<v Speaker 4>What do you.</v>

1858
00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:43.300
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to get into all that,</v>

1859
00:56:43.301 --> 00:56:44.134
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

1860
00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:44.870
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1861
00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:45.131
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1862
00:56:45.131 --> 00:56:45.670
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

1863
00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:45.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1864
00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:48.580
<v Speaker 4>Just seems like everybody's mishandling the data.</v>

1865
00:56:48.581 --> 00:56:51.310
<v Speaker 4>The scientists are too shy.</v>

1866
00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:52.661
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1867
00:56:52.661 --> 00:56:52.961
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1868
00:56:52.961 --> 00:56:53.794
<v Speaker 4>some of the,</v>

1869
00:56:53.890 --> 00:56:56.320
<v Speaker 4>one of the scientists say that no,</v>

1870
00:56:56.530 --> 00:56:56.950
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1871
00:56:56.950 --> 00:56:57.251
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1872
00:56:57.251 --> 00:57:02.251
<v Speaker 4>everybody's had that climatologists err on the side of conservatism.</v>

1873
00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:03.971
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1874
00:57:03.971 --> 00:57:04.570
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

1875
00:57:04.570 --> 00:57:06.820
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to be conservative with their,</v>

1876
00:57:07.620 --> 00:57:08.170
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1877
00:57:08.170 --> 00:57:08.920
<v Speaker 4>their views.</v>

1878
00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:09.670
<v Speaker 4>But then again,</v>

1879
00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:10.960
<v Speaker 4>like the models don't,</v>

1880
00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:13.900
<v Speaker 4>don't necessarily add up.</v>

1881
00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:16.900
<v Speaker 4>And one of the guys who was heralded the,</v>

1882
00:57:16.901 --> 00:57:17.440
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1883
00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:17.981
<v Speaker 4>the most,</v>

1884
00:57:17.981 --> 00:57:22.750
<v Speaker 4>I forget who he was big in the seventies who predicted,</v>

1885
00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:23.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1886
00:57:24.370 --> 00:57:26.490
<v Speaker 4>large scale and he's still harold,</v>

1887
00:57:26.491 --> 00:57:29.110
<v Speaker 4>that you predicted large scale famines.</v>

1888
00:57:29.580 --> 00:57:30.413
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1889
00:57:30.850 --> 00:57:31.740
<v Speaker 4>just all of this,</v>

1890
00:57:31.810 --> 00:57:33.130
<v Speaker 4>this the single guy,</v>

1891
00:57:33.131 --> 00:57:38.131
<v Speaker 4>and he was like a guru to the climatology movement and most of his stuff ended</v>

1892
00:57:39.791 --> 00:57:42.820
<v Speaker 4>up not becoming true and uh,</v>

1893
00:57:43.020 --> 00:57:44.170
<v Speaker 4>and there's still people who,</v>

1894
00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:45.063
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1895
00:57:45.250 --> 00:57:45.590
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1896
00:57:45.590 --> 00:57:46.870
<v Speaker 4>but that's another thing is that,</v>

1897
00:57:46.871 --> 00:57:47.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1898
00:57:47.110 --> 00:57:48.790
<v Speaker 4>this kind of tologist beckwith,</v>

1899
00:57:48.791 --> 00:57:49.121
<v Speaker 4>they'll say,</v>

1900
00:57:49.121 --> 00:57:53.470
<v Speaker 4>we don't know what happens when the positive feedback loops start happening.</v>

1901
00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:57.460
<v Speaker 4>Like it could be a really slippery slope and it will be,</v>

1902
00:57:58.030 --> 00:57:58.660
<v Speaker 4>it will,</v>

1903
00:57:58.660 --> 00:58:01.060
<v Speaker 4>it will start happening so quickly.</v>

1904
00:58:01.090 --> 00:58:02.170
<v Speaker 4>And whether that means,</v>

1905
00:58:02.171 --> 00:58:02.350
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1906
00:58:02.350 --> 00:58:03.071
<v Speaker 4>within five,</v>

1907
00:58:03.071 --> 00:58:03.904
<v Speaker 4>10,</v>

1908
00:58:03.940 --> 00:58:04.361
<v Speaker 4>20,</v>

1909
00:58:04.361 --> 00:58:04.841
<v Speaker 4>30,</v>

<v Speaker 4>50,</v>

1911
00:58:05.351 --> 00:58:06.220
<v Speaker 4>100 years,</v>

1912
00:58:06.250 --> 00:58:08.170
<v Speaker 4>whatever those timeframes are,</v>

1913
00:58:08.171 --> 00:58:10.060
<v Speaker 4>because it seems like nobody can model this out.</v>

1914
00:58:10.180 --> 00:58:11.530
<v Speaker 4>Nobody can predict.</v>

1915
00:58:12.130 --> 00:58:12.710
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1916

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1923
00:58:20.620 --> 00:58:21.730
<v Speaker 4>the sea level is rising,</v>

1924
00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:22.600
<v Speaker 4>not a big deal.</v>

1925

<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1926
00:58:23.171 --> 00:58:28.171
<v Speaker 4>what I'm concerned with is just the slight increase in heat changing,</v>

1927
00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:29.223
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1928

<v Speaker 4>the effects on Farnam changing based off of,</v>

1933
00:58:37.261 --> 00:58:38.080
<v Speaker 4>in our ag,</v>

1934
00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:42.430
<v Speaker 4>in ag or aggregation aggregation society.</v>

1935
00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:43.593
<v Speaker 4>That society.</v>

1936
00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:45.380
<v Speaker 4>We don't look at Grit.</v>

00:58:45.390 --> 00:58:45.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1938

<v Speaker 4>our agricultural being affected by a,</v>

1940
00:58:48.870 --> 00:58:53.870
<v Speaker 4>you definitely being affected by the slight increase in heat and,</v>

1941
00:58:55.180 --> 00:58:56.290
<v Speaker 4>and that the,</v>

1942
00:58:56.980 --> 00:59:01.980
<v Speaker 4>basically the famines will start happening so quickly that people like myself,</v>

1943
00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:03.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

00:59:25.131 --> 00:59:26.750
<v Speaker 3>the state will vow will,</v>

1961
00:59:26.751 --> 00:59:29.060
<v Speaker 3>Vive will vie to protect itself.</v>

1962
00:59:29.090 --> 00:59:30.020
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

1963
00:59:30.021 --> 00:59:30.261
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1964
00:59:30.261 --> 00:59:32.240
<v Speaker 3>this guy who's saying,</v>

1965
00:59:32.241 --> 00:59:34.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm concerned about agriculture being affected,</v>

1966
00:59:34.791 --> 00:59:35.510
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

1967
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:35.841
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1968
00:59:35.841 --> 00:59:36.860
<v Speaker 3>I immediately think of,</v>

1969
00:59:36.861 --> 00:59:36.991
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1970
00:59:36.991 --> 00:59:39.470
<v Speaker 3>we have a company called Monsanto who,</v>

1971
00:59:39.650 --> 00:59:40.483
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1972
00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:41.511
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

1973
00:59:41.511 --> 00:59:41.811
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1974
00:59:41.811 --> 00:59:45.530
<v Speaker 3>there's shady practices and they've got a bad history,</v>

1975
00:59:45.830 --> 00:59:47.000
<v Speaker 3>but they've created,</v>

1976
00:59:47.090 --> 00:59:50.240
<v Speaker 3>I assume they've created drought and heat resistant</v>

1977
00:59:52.330 --> 00:59:53.430
<v Speaker 3>plants are,</v>

1978
00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:54.480
<v Speaker 3>they're doing that all the time.</v>

1979
00:59:54.481 --> 00:59:57.840
<v Speaker 3>Like I used to be one of those people that would like maybe protest them.</v>

1980
00:59:58.520 --> 00:59:58.830
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1981
00:59:58.830 --> 00:59:59.131
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1982
00:59:59.131 --> 00:59:59.790
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1983
00:59:59.790 --> 01:00:01.350
<v Speaker 3>but not that I ever went to a protest,</v>

1984
01:00:01.351 --> 01:00:02.340
<v Speaker 3>but they,</v>

1985
01:00:02.370 --> 01:00:02.701
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1986
01:00:02.701 --> 01:00:03.210
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1987
01:00:03.210 --> 01:00:04.410
<v Speaker 3>they've definitely changed.</v>

1988
01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:07.270
<v Speaker 3>They definitely become more,</v>

1989
01:00:07.271 --> 01:00:07.720
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1990
01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:09.100
<v Speaker 3>like scientifically.</v>

1991
01:00:09.390 --> 01:00:09.550
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1992
01:00:09.550 --> 01:00:10.331
<v Speaker 3>people are always like worried.</v>

1993
01:00:10.331 --> 01:00:10.551
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

1994
01:00:10.551 --> 01:00:11.770
<v Speaker 3>what do you want the meadows,</v>

1995
01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:13.720
<v Speaker 3>the salmon genes and the river.</v>

1996
01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:14.711
<v Speaker 3>I'm just like,</v>

1997
01:00:14.711 --> 01:00:14.951
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1998
01:00:14.951 --> 01:00:16.330
<v Speaker 3>well I thought that might have been bad.</v>

1999
01:00:16.331 --> 01:00:18.040
<v Speaker 3>But now I looked and I looked into it.</v>

2000
01:00:18.041 --> 01:00:18.641
<v Speaker 3>The scientists,</v>

2001
01:00:18.641 --> 01:00:19.460
<v Speaker 3>I'll say,</v>

2002
01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:19.640
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2003
01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:20.970
<v Speaker 3>I guess actually serious,</v>

2004
01:00:21.010 --> 01:00:21.750
<v Speaker 3>no trouble at all.</v>

2005
01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:22.610
<v Speaker 3>The No.</v>

2006
01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:24.873
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2007
01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:25.861
<v Speaker 3>so they,</v>

2008
01:00:25.861 --> 01:00:26.950
<v Speaker 3>they have some problems for,</v>

2009
01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:27.970
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

2010
01:00:27.970 --> 01:00:28.371
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

2011
01:00:28.371 --> 01:00:29.204
<v Speaker 3>Like they,</v>

2012
01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:30.173
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2013
01:00:31.490 --> 01:00:32.323
<v Speaker 3>one second.</v>

2014
01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:38.570
<v Speaker 3>So the kid was crunching up a,</v>

2015
01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:39.580
<v Speaker 3>a plastic bag,</v>

2016
01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:43.200
<v Speaker 3>so I'll just tell him to shut up,</v>

2017
01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:43.840
<v Speaker 3>shut up.</v>

2018
01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:44.351
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

2019
01:00:44.351 --> 01:00:44.661
<v Speaker 3>anyways,</v>

2020
01:00:44.661 --> 01:00:44.900
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

2021
01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:45.733
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2022
01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:46.961
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2023
01:00:46.961 --> 01:00:47.430
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2024
01:00:47.430 --> 01:00:47.740
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2025
01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:47.960
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2026
01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:48.701
<v Speaker 3>things like Monsanto,</v>

2027
01:00:48.701 --> 01:00:49.900
<v Speaker 3>there's good and bad things about it,</v>

2028
01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:54.610
<v Speaker 3>but hopefully that some of the good things were that we were able to adapt.</v>

2029
01:00:54.790 --> 01:00:55.360
<v Speaker 3>Like for instance,</v>

2030
01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:56.920
<v Speaker 3>do you know anything about the norse history?</v>

2031
01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:59.470
<v Speaker 3>Like the Vikings and stuff on the Greenland?</v>

2032
01:00:59.950 --> 01:01:00.783
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2033
01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:02.841
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2034
01:01:02.841 --> 01:01:03.260
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2035
01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:04.220
<v Speaker 3>so they were in greenland,</v>

2036
01:01:04.221 --> 01:01:04.401
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2037
01:01:04.401 --> 01:01:05.390
<v Speaker 3>And they could grow crops.</v>

2038
01:01:05.391 --> 01:01:07.300
<v Speaker 3>At the time it was like barley and they wrote,</v>

2039
01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:12.460
<v Speaker 3>they were raising sheep and stuff at the time that was like think up until 1400</v>

2040
01:01:12.921 --> 01:01:13.581
<v Speaker 3>or 1300.</v>

2041
01:01:13.581 --> 01:01:14.630
<v Speaker 3>They were doing that from around,</v>

2042
01:01:14.631 --> 01:01:15.200
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2043
01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:18.100
<v Speaker 3>around a thousand 80 and a,</v>

2044
01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:19.730
<v Speaker 3>maybe slightly before that,</v>

2045
01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:23.320
<v Speaker 3>or they have all these settlements there and they're able to survive.</v>

2046
01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:26.510
<v Speaker 3>They had like several thousand people living in Greenland at the time,</v>

2047
01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:27.320
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

2048
01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:27.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2049
01:01:27.770 --> 01:01:29.030
<v Speaker 3>I think getting greenland now,</v>

2050
01:01:29.090 --> 01:01:30.350
<v Speaker 3>even with all the modern technology,</v>

2051
01:01:30.351 --> 01:01:33.620
<v Speaker 3>that's like 40,000 people or something across the entire,</v>

2052
01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:34.850
<v Speaker 3>the entire place.</v>

2053
01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:36.013
<v Speaker 3>So there,</v>

2054
01:01:36.290 --> 01:01:40.070
<v Speaker 3>but then it got too cold and by $1,400 all the settlements had to be abandoned</v>

2055
01:01:40.071 --> 01:01:41.220
<v Speaker 3>because they couldn't grow anything.</v>

2056
01:01:41.221 --> 01:01:41.851
<v Speaker 3>And everyone needs,</v>

2057
01:01:41.851 --> 01:01:43.040
<v Speaker 3>you're starved to death row left.</v>

2058
01:01:43.150 --> 01:01:45.710
<v Speaker 3>Not that there's any written records except for uh,</v>

2059
01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:46.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2060
01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:46.761
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>

2061
01:01:46.761 --> 01:01:47.594
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2062
01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:52.400
<v Speaker 3>stone squares that are basically that remain remain remainder is like arctic</v>

2063
01:01:52.850 --> 01:01:54.470
<v Speaker 3>archaeological digs,</v>

2064
01:01:54.471 --> 01:01:55.970
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

2065
01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.800
<v Speaker 3>to climate change so faster in the medieval warm period to now that like,</v>

2066
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:02.720
<v Speaker 3>those settlements basically got wiped out.</v>

2067
01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:05.360
<v Speaker 3>All that was left was the nun who didn't settle anyways.</v>

2068
01:02:05.361 --> 01:02:08.120
<v Speaker 3>They're always moving around hunting the animals that were on the move.</v>

2069
01:02:08.121 --> 01:02:08.954
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2070
01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:10.790
<v Speaker 3>So even in that short period,</v>

2071
01:02:10.791 --> 01:02:13.550
<v Speaker 3>we could see there was a climate change and even now,</v>

2072
01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:16.580
<v Speaker 3>but back then they didn't have,</v>

2073
01:02:16.581 --> 01:02:16.820
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2074
01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:19.900
<v Speaker 3>we weren't burning oil and massive amounts of oil and thought</v>

2075
01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:21.770
<v Speaker 4>it would be.</v>

2076
01:02:21.770 --> 01:02:23.040
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't any different than it is now.</v>

2077
01:02:23.790 --> 01:02:25.800
<v Speaker 4>So what caused it,</v>

2078
01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:26.693
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2079
01:02:27.150 --> 01:02:28.470
<v Speaker 4>If it wasn't those two things,</v>

2080
01:02:29.250 --> 01:02:30.120
<v Speaker 4>it could be that,</v>

2081
01:02:30.121 --> 01:02:30.661
<v Speaker 4>that's the problem.</v>

2082
01:02:30.661 --> 01:02:32.160
<v Speaker 4>It could be a myriad of other things.</v>

2083
01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:34.200
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2084
01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:35.270
<v Speaker 4>it's another thing is like,</v>

2085
01:02:35.930 --> 01:02:36.763
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2086
01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:39.070
<v Speaker 4>when I mentioned potholders,</v>

2087
01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:39.953
<v Speaker 4>like he'll,</v>

2088
01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:43.260
<v Speaker 4>he'll go over into a lot of these timeframes and it'll show you that,</v>

2089
01:02:44.010 --> 01:02:44.461
<v Speaker 4>like this,</v>

2090
01:02:44.461 --> 01:02:49.461
<v Speaker 4>the science is settled and it's clear and this is what happened then.</v>

2091
01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:53.010
<v Speaker 4>And I don't know exactly why,</v>

2092
01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:53.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2093
01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:55.800
<v Speaker 4>I'm bringing up right right now,</v>

2094
01:02:56.010 --> 01:02:58.740
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not sure that.</v>

2095
01:02:59.040 --> 01:02:59.873
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2096
01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:00.810
<v Speaker 4>well maybe,</v>

2097
01:03:00.810 --> 01:03:01.170
<v Speaker 4>maybe,</v>

2098
01:03:01.170 --> 01:03:01.830
<v Speaker 4>maybe he's right.</v>

2099
01:03:01.830 --> 01:03:02.380
<v Speaker 4>Maybe he's right.</v>

2100
01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:03.213
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2101
01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:04.970
<v Speaker 4>It's weird how he just,</v>

2102
01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:05.310
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2103
01:03:05.310 --> 01:03:06.090
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

2104
01:03:06.090 --> 01:03:09.830
<v Speaker 4>he just fled because he's a journalist and because he's been a journalist for</v>

2105
01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:10.773
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

2106
01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:12.273
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

2107
01:03:13.570 --> 01:03:14.980
<v Speaker 4>I forget exactly what,</v>

2108
01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:16.813
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

2109
01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:19.390
<v Speaker 4>he just comes up with this information,</v>

2110
01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:20.370
<v Speaker 4>insights it and,</v>

2111
01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:21.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2112
01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:22.530
<v Speaker 4>and he timestamps,</v>

2113
01:03:23.210 --> 01:03:23.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2114
01:03:23.550 --> 01:03:27.660
<v Speaker 4>exactly every part of the video where he mentions anything,</v>

2115
01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:32.880
<v Speaker 4>he'll cite it and it's timestamped citation and so you can look it up and it's,</v>

2116
01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:34.253
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>

2117
01:03:35.850 --> 01:03:40.850
<v Speaker 4>it's really crazy because until I saw until I saw him present some of the</v>

2118
01:03:42.061 --> 01:03:42.960
<v Speaker 4>information,</v>

2119
01:03:43.410 --> 01:03:44.970
<v Speaker 4>it was much more.</v>

2120
01:03:46.410 --> 01:03:47.131
<v Speaker 4>It's like nobody,</v>

2121
01:03:47.131 --> 01:03:47.700
<v Speaker 4>I have never,</v>

2122
01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:49.020
<v Speaker 4>I haven't seen anybody do it.</v>

2123
01:03:49.550 --> 01:03:50.000
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2124
01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:50.520
<v Speaker 4>and the reason,</v>

2125
01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:54.780
<v Speaker 4>that's the reason I bring up potholder so much is because it's like Jesus</v>

2126
01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:54.781
<v Speaker 4>Christ,</v>

2127
01:03:54.781 --> 01:03:55.614
<v Speaker 4>this guy,</v>

2128
01:03:56.270 --> 01:03:56.820
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2129
01:03:56.820 --> 01:04:00.660
<v Speaker 4>it takes him no effort to just dispel,</v>

2130
01:04:02.330 --> 01:04:02.761
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2131
01:04:02.761 --> 01:04:03.594
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2132
01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:05.760
<v Speaker 4>the Heritage Foundation.</v>

2133
01:04:06.770 --> 01:04:07.250
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2134
01:04:07.250 --> 01:04:08.083
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2135
01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:09.413
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2136
01:04:10.050 --> 01:04:11.190
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how much money,</v>

2137
01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:11.461
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2138
01:04:11.461 --> 01:04:12.690
<v Speaker 4>the Heritage Foundation.</v>

2139
01:04:14.430 --> 01:04:15.170
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what,</v>

2140
01:04:15.170 --> 01:04:15.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2141
01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:16.201
<v Speaker 4>they're our think tank.</v>

2142
01:04:16.201 --> 01:04:17.910
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how they get your revenue.</v>

2143
01:04:17.911 --> 01:04:20.640
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I would say think tank.</v>

2144
01:04:20.641 --> 01:04:20.790
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2145
01:04:20.790 --> 01:04:21.630
<v Speaker 4>probably get donors.</v>

2146
01:04:21.690 --> 01:04:22.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2147
01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:23.220
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2148
01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:23.490
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

2149
01:04:23.490 --> 01:04:23.701
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2150
01:04:23.701 --> 01:04:25.530
<v Speaker 4>he's dispelling a billion.</v>

2151
01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:28.830
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's because they don't try so hard because it's not a,</v>

2152
01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:34.160
<v Speaker 4>it's just one of the things on the agenda to manipulate and for whatever reason,</v>

2153
01:04:36.151 --> 01:04:36.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2154
01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:37.140
<v Speaker 4>you don't,</v>

2155
01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:38.130
<v Speaker 4>who knows why.</v>

2156
01:04:38.310 --> 01:04:39.143
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's because,</v>

2157
01:04:39.210 --> 01:04:39.830
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>

2158
01:04:39.830 --> 01:04:44.040
<v Speaker 4>we don't want to put the effort in innovation right now that we have these</v>

2159
01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:45.451
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>

2160
01:04:45.451 --> 01:04:45.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2161
01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:47.250
<v Speaker 4>I'm just speculating obviously,</v>

2162
01:04:47.251 --> 01:04:48.084
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

2163
01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:49.753
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2164
01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:51.630
<v Speaker 4>I dunno if it's coherent,</v>

2165
01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:53.850
<v Speaker 4>the speculation that,</v>

2166
01:04:53.870 --> 01:04:54.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2167
01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:57.630
<v Speaker 4>maybe it's that we don't want to tackle climate change right now because there</v>

2168
01:04:57.631 --> 01:04:58.890
<v Speaker 4>are other things are,</v>

2169
01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:00.053
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2170
01:05:00.330 --> 01:05:00.600
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>

2171
01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:00.841
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2172
01:05:00.841 --> 01:05:04.510
<v Speaker 4>the donors businesses are being affected by this right now.</v>

2173
01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:05.850
<v Speaker 4>Time for this.</v>

2174
01:05:05.851 --> 01:05:06.684
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2175
01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:07.680
<v Speaker 4>one thing,</v>

2176
01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:12.680
<v Speaker 4>I think you're Lumberg was saying that you can spend a dollar on a family</v>

2177
01:05:15.871 --> 01:05:18.010
<v Speaker 4>planning for third or develop women in</v>

2178
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:19.030
<v Speaker 5>developing nations.</v>

2179
01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:23.650
<v Speaker 5>I think you'd get a return of 120 bucks every time or 60 bucks or something like</v>

2180
01:05:23.651 --> 01:05:23.771
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

2181
01:05:23.771 --> 01:05:27.850
<v Speaker 5>Every time you spend $1 on that in terms of like overall economic value in this</v>

2182
01:05:27.851 --> 01:05:31.210
<v Speaker 5>is all done by a large group of independent economists.</v>

2183
01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:32.693
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2184
01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:36.010
<v Speaker 5>and then you get climate change and for every dollar you spend on mitigating</v>

2185
01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:36.641
<v Speaker 5>climate change,</v>

2186
01:05:36.641 --> 01:05:39.010
<v Speaker 5>now you'll get about three to $4 in value.</v>

2187
01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:40.073
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

2188
01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:41.513
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

2189
01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:44.130
<v Speaker 5>So like you could do way more,</v>

2190
01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:46.290
<v Speaker 5>have way more of an impact,</v>

2191
01:05:46.291 --> 01:05:48.540
<v Speaker 5>like more bang for your buck if you spend it in the right way.</v>

2192
01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:50.400
<v Speaker 5>And I was thinking,</v>

2193
01:05:50.490 --> 01:05:50.791
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2194
01:05:50.791 --> 01:05:51.410
<v Speaker 5>well I,</v>

2195
01:05:51.410 --> 01:05:52.200
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2196
01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:57.200
<v Speaker 5>I'm gonna and they use the most extreme climate change scenarios.</v>

2197
01:05:57.841 --> 01:05:58.830
<v Speaker 5>Like they always go when,</v>

2198
01:05:58.890 --> 01:06:00.960
<v Speaker 5>when they do those calculations they do it,</v>

2199
01:06:00.961 --> 01:06:01.920
<v Speaker 5>but for the most extreme.</v>

2200
01:06:02.550 --> 01:06:05.860
<v Speaker 5>So I'm basically,</v>

2201
01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:09.640
<v Speaker 5>it comes up all these recommendations for like how you can spend your money</v>

2202
01:06:09.641 --> 01:06:10.080
<v Speaker 5>best.</v>

2203
01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:11.890
<v Speaker 5>And after I looked at them like,</v>

2204
01:06:11.891 --> 01:06:12.221
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2205
01:06:12.221 --> 01:06:12.461
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2206
01:06:12.461 --> 01:06:13.294
<v Speaker 5>climate change,</v>

2207
01:06:13.650 --> 01:06:15.600
<v Speaker 5>let's say it's the worst possible problem.</v>

2208
01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:16.360
<v Speaker 5>There's still like,</v>

2209
01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:16.541
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2210
01:06:16.541 --> 01:06:17.530
<v Speaker 5>way down the list.</v>

2211
01:06:18.370 --> 01:06:19.203
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>

2212
01:06:19.210 --> 01:06:19.750
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

2213
01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:20.800
<v Speaker 5>I would probably,</v>

2214
01:06:20.801 --> 01:06:20.930
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2215
01:06:20.930 --> 01:06:21.340
<v Speaker 5>if we,</v>

2216
01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:21.610
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

2217
01:06:21.610 --> 01:06:25.210
<v Speaker 5>if I thought that what if we got to do something who would definitely fix it?</v>

2218
01:06:25.211 --> 01:06:26.680
<v Speaker 5>I would definitely be okay with that.</v>

2219
01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:30.700
<v Speaker 5>The problem is I just don't feel confident that like you can get the results</v>

2220
01:06:30.701 --> 01:06:33.660
<v Speaker 5>that they say seems to be speculative.</v>

2221
01:06:33.950 --> 01:06:34.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2222
01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:37.740
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing is that the climatologist I listened to or this are the same</v>

2223
01:06:37.741 --> 01:06:38.970
<v Speaker 4>way they're not.</v>

2224
01:06:39.210 --> 01:06:39.930
<v Speaker 4>If we,</v>

2225
01:06:39.930 --> 01:06:41.280
<v Speaker 4>if we take action,</v>

2226
01:06:41.281 --> 01:06:42.120
<v Speaker 4>it will fix it.</v>

2227
01:06:42.121 --> 01:06:42.481
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2228
01:06:42.481 --> 01:06:43.314
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2229
01:06:44.250 --> 01:06:46.500
<v Speaker 4>maybe we think it will.</v>

2230
01:06:46.501 --> 01:06:48.750
<v Speaker 4>We know that immediately that,</v>

2231
01:06:48.910 --> 01:06:49.230
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2232
01:06:49.230 --> 01:06:50.730
<v Speaker 4>we spray aerosols in the air,</v>

2233
01:06:50.910 --> 01:06:51.743
<v Speaker 4>the average,</v>

2234
01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:51.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2235
01:06:51.930 --> 01:06:53.280
<v Speaker 4>the temperature will get cooler,</v>

2236
01:06:53.281 --> 01:06:54.810
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

2237
01:06:54.820 --> 01:06:55.650
<v Speaker 4>they don't.</v>

2238
01:06:55.650 --> 01:06:56.940
<v Speaker 4>Then they don't say that.</v>

2239
01:06:57.660 --> 01:06:59.220
<v Speaker 4>They don't then say that.</v>

2240
01:06:59.850 --> 01:07:02.310
<v Speaker 4>What we don't know if it will always get cooler,</v>

2241
01:07:02.311 --> 01:07:02.551
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2242
01:07:02.551 --> 01:07:03.980
<v Speaker 4>I think the,</v>

2243
01:07:04.270 --> 01:07:05.340
<v Speaker 4>they're conservative.</v>

2244
01:07:05.490 --> 01:07:06.450
<v Speaker 4>They don't want to say that.</v>

2245
01:07:07.110 --> 01:07:08.940
<v Speaker 4>I think a lot of people just are like,</v>

2246
01:07:08.970 --> 01:07:09.061
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2247
01:07:09.061 --> 01:07:13.530
<v Speaker 4>we don't really know what is necessarily going to happen,</v>

2248
01:07:13.590 --> 01:07:13.981
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2249
01:07:13.981 --> 01:07:14.620
<v Speaker 4>and what,</v>

2250
01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:16.330
<v Speaker 4>and that's just you.</v>

2251
01:07:16.580 --> 01:07:17.880
<v Speaker 4>You bring down the temperature.</v>

2252
01:07:17.881 --> 01:07:18.241
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

2253
01:07:18.241 --> 01:07:23.241
<v Speaker 4>so you stop a blue ocean event where and when you stopped the permafrost melting</v>

2254
01:07:23.581 --> 01:07:25.770
<v Speaker 4>and the methane being released into the atmosphere,</v>

2255
01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:27.360
<v Speaker 4>you stop all these things,</v>

2256
01:07:27.361 --> 01:07:28.160
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

2257
01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:29.100
<v Speaker 4>what happens?</v>

2258
01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:30.583
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

2259
01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:31.730
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

2260
01:07:31.730 --> 01:07:32.563
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

2261
01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:35.950
<v Speaker 4>Can the aerosols that the geoengineering hey,</v>

2262
01:07:35.990 --> 01:07:37.100
<v Speaker 4>have a negative effect.</v>

2263
01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:38.580
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's a</v>

2264
01:07:40.130 --> 01:07:41.820
<v Speaker 5>or what happened when all that nothing comes out.</v>

2265
01:07:41.821 --> 01:07:44.210
<v Speaker 5>Does it have the effects that they say it's going to have?</v>

2266
01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:44.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2267
01:07:44.970 --> 01:07:45.803
<v Speaker 4>that too.</v>

2268
01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:46.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2269
01:07:46.650 --> 01:07:47.370
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

2270
01:07:47.370 --> 01:07:47.821
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2271
01:07:47.821 --> 01:07:48.630
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2272
01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:50.700
<v Speaker 4>I mean obviously,</v>

2273
01:07:51.450 --> 01:07:51.871
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2274
01:07:51.871 --> 01:07:52.440
<v Speaker 4>in a,</v>

2275
01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:52.770
<v Speaker 4>in a,</v>

2276
01:07:52.770 --> 01:07:54.600
<v Speaker 4>in a micro environment,</v>

2277
01:07:55.110 --> 01:07:55.321
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2278
01:07:55.321 --> 01:07:57.570
<v Speaker 4>methane will kill you.</v>

2279
01:07:58.170 --> 01:07:58.750
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

2280
01:07:58.750 --> 01:07:59.221
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2281
01:07:59.221 --> 01:08:01.410
<v Speaker 4>in the macro world,</v>

2282
01:08:01.890 --> 01:08:02.191
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2283
01:08:02.191 --> 01:08:02.830
<v Speaker 4>what does,</v>

2284
01:08:02.830 --> 01:08:05.910
<v Speaker 4>what effect does that have an eye and paddle or my one over that and some of the</v>

2285
01:08:05.970 --> 01:08:09.420
<v Speaker 4>other climatologists I may have went over that and I'm not able to remember.</v>

2286
01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:10.420
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2287
01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:12.000
<v Speaker 4>I'm shit at retention.</v>

2288
01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:12.910
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2289
01:08:12.910 --> 01:08:13.743
<v Speaker 7>but,</v>

2290
01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:14.633
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

2291
01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:16.460
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

2292
01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:17.293
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

2293
01:08:18.390 --> 01:08:18.921
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

2294
01:08:18.921 --> 01:08:22.040
<v Speaker 4>it's a really weird issue and uh,</v>

2295
01:08:23.030 --> 01:08:28.030
<v Speaker 4>I really had a lot of admiration for Peterson when he said,</v>

2296
01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:30.273
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2297
01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:31.253
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2298
01:08:31.310 --> 01:08:33.590
<v Speaker 4>we don't really know what to do about it and even if,</v>

2299
01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:34.161
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2300
01:08:34.161 --> 01:08:35.000
<v Speaker 4>unless we all do,</v>

2301
01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:37.340
<v Speaker 4>I don't know that it is necessarily said unless we all do something,</v>

2302
01:08:37.341 --> 01:08:38.174
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't matter.</v>

2303
01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:39.393
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2304
01:08:39.890 --> 01:08:40.611
<v Speaker 4>but that's the truth.</v>

2305
01:08:40.611 --> 01:08:40.851
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2306
01:08:40.851 --> 01:08:42.800
<v Speaker 4>it seems like we just don't know that,</v>

2307
01:08:43.010 --> 01:08:43.843
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2308
01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:49.180
<v Speaker 4>there's like short term things fixes that could eventually have,</v>

2309
01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:52.431
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2310
01:08:52.431 --> 01:08:53.980
<v Speaker 4>other problems later,</v>

2311
01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.231
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2312
01:08:54.231 --> 01:08:54.740
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

2313
01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:57.290
<v Speaker 4>you trying to solve something and you just create problems.</v>

2314
01:08:57.320 --> 01:08:57.801
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

2315
01:08:57.801 --> 01:08:58.041
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

2316
01:08:58.041 --> 01:08:58.660
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

2317
01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:00.740
<v Speaker 4>that's almost always the case with anything,</v>

2318
01:09:01.050 --> 01:09:01.570
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2319
01:09:01.570 --> 01:09:02.860
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2320
01:09:02.990 --> 01:09:03.621
<v Speaker 4>not always,</v>

2321
01:09:03.621 --> 01:09:04.910
<v Speaker 4>but in a lot of ways,</v>

2322
01:09:04.940 --> 01:09:05.211
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2323
01:09:05.211 --> 01:09:09.050
<v Speaker 4>you create a solution and you know,</v>

2324
01:09:09.051 --> 01:09:10.820
<v Speaker 4>you then there's unforeseen problems</v>

2325
01:09:12.530 --> 01:09:13.510
<v Speaker 4>when you impact them in.</v>

2326
01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:14.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2327
01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:15.333
<v Speaker 4>I dunno,</v>

2328
01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:17.460
<v Speaker 3>it's like a,</v>

2329
01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:20.260
<v Speaker 3>this is like a total sidetrack,</v>

2330
01:09:20.261 --> 01:09:22.000
<v Speaker 3>but cameras you have like immigration,</v>

2331
01:09:22.030 --> 01:09:22.860
<v Speaker 3>how like there's,</v>

2332
01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:26.590
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of like the view we get a bit from one side and the other is usually</v>

2333
01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:27.573
<v Speaker 3>very myopic.</v>

2334
01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:30.850
<v Speaker 3>Like it just gives you sort of one,</v>

2335
01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:32.710
<v Speaker 3>one narrow view,</v>

2336
01:09:32.711 --> 01:09:33.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2337
01:09:33.090 --> 01:09:37.780
<v Speaker 3>then on the right and then they have one narrow view on the left and see,</v>

2338
01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:38.800
<v Speaker 3>you don't really get the,</v>

2339
01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:41.080
<v Speaker 3>you got to really narrow view of the entire,</v>

2340
01:09:41.110 --> 01:09:42.670
<v Speaker 3>like say broad spectrum of,</v>

2341
01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:43.553
<v Speaker 3>of the issue.</v>

2342
01:09:44.070 --> 01:09:44.903
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2343
01:09:45.410 --> 01:09:46.121
<v Speaker 3>like for example,</v>

2344
01:09:46.121 --> 01:09:47.020
<v Speaker 3>like they say,</v>

2345
01:09:47.021 --> 01:09:47.291
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2346
01:09:47.291 --> 01:09:52.291
<v Speaker 3>well our population is declining so we need immigrants to help buttress the</v>

2347
01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:54.370
<v Speaker 3>engine system or something.</v>

2348
01:09:55.940 --> 01:09:56.800
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense.</v>

2349
01:09:57.220 --> 01:09:57.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2350
01:09:57.480 --> 01:09:59.530
<v Speaker 3>Because there's a lot of the left doesn't make that argument,</v>

2351
01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:01.300
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time they'll say like,</v>

2352
01:10:01.330 --> 01:10:01.691
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2353
01:10:01.691 --> 01:10:02.410
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2354
01:10:02.410 --> 01:10:02.810
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2355
01:10:02.810 --> 01:10:04.990
<v Speaker 3>to many people's bad because it hurts the environment,</v>

2356
01:10:05.370 --> 01:10:06.203
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>

2357
01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:07.300
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2358
01:10:07.300 --> 01:10:07.640
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2359
01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:08.620
<v Speaker 3>and then the right,</v>

2360
01:10:08.621 --> 01:10:09.071
<v Speaker 3>we'll say,</v>

2361
01:10:09.071 --> 01:10:09.431
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2362
01:10:09.431 --> 01:10:11.760
<v Speaker 3>well it also hurts Roy.</v>

2363
01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:12.340
<v Speaker 3>It's waste,</v>

2364
01:10:12.340 --> 01:10:15.900
<v Speaker 3>which is weird because the right also says it hurts workers rights or workers</v>

2365
01:10:15.910 --> 01:10:18.430
<v Speaker 3>like ability to market their skills now,</v>

2366
01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:21.260
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time I think,</v>

2367
01:10:21.370 --> 01:10:24.980
<v Speaker 3>I think it does in certain fields it does definitely in the trades,</v>

2368
01:10:25.330 --> 01:10:25.790
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2369
01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:27.950
<v Speaker 3>because you get a lot of illegal workers.</v>

2370
01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:28.761
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2371
01:10:28.761 --> 01:10:29.594
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

2372
01:10:33.090 --> 01:10:33.830
<v Speaker 3>no just said,</v>

2373
01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:35.130
<v Speaker 3>paused for a second there for some reason.</v>

2374
01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:36.673
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2375
01:10:36.730 --> 01:10:37.071
<v Speaker 4>well I was,</v>

2376
01:10:37.071 --> 01:10:40.370
<v Speaker 4>I was saying that it does affect the trades I believe,</v>

2377
01:10:40.490 --> 01:10:45.320
<v Speaker 4>but it affects employees in the trades and effects.</v>

2378
01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:46.640
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2379
01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:48.110
<v Speaker 4>I think people on the lower,</v>

2380
01:10:49.950 --> 01:10:52.760
<v Speaker 4>a lower part of the totem pole of,</v>

2381
01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:54.440
<v Speaker 4>of income.</v>

2382
01:10:55.310 --> 01:10:55.491
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2383
01:10:55.491 --> 01:10:56.420
<v Speaker 3>Lower income jobs,</v>

2384
01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:57.740
<v Speaker 3>low lower income,</v>

2385
01:10:57.741 --> 01:10:59.090
<v Speaker 3>self employed jobs too.</v>

2386
01:10:59.091 --> 01:11:02.240
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's harder to break out when,</v>

2387
01:11:02.330 --> 01:11:02.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2388
01:11:02.690 --> 01:11:03.590
<v Speaker 3>illegals are</v>

2389
01:11:03.650 --> 01:11:06.110
<v Speaker 4>able to work for,</v>

2390
01:11:06.710 --> 01:11:06.981
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2391
01:11:06.981 --> 01:11:10.370
<v Speaker 4>so cheap under the table.</v>

2392
01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:12.081
<v Speaker 4>Well that's the thing,</v>

2393
01:11:12.081 --> 01:11:12.410
<v Speaker 4>is it?</v>

2394
01:11:12.410 --> 01:11:12.621
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2395
01:11:12.621 --> 01:11:13.141
<v Speaker 4>that's the thing.</v>

2396
01:11:13.141 --> 01:11:14.070
<v Speaker 4>Is that illegal?</v>

2397
01:11:14.071 --> 01:11:14.311
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

2398
01:11:14.311 --> 01:11:17.190
<v Speaker 4>I've had illegal friends and they pay taxes.</v>

2399
01:11:18.150 --> 01:11:19.740
<v Speaker 4>Taxes are taken out of their checks.</v>

2400
01:11:19.741 --> 01:11:19.921
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2401
01:11:19.921 --> 01:11:21.630
<v Speaker 4>that's not a uh,</v>

2402
01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:21.841
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2403
01:11:21.841 --> 01:11:24.450
<v Speaker 4>they just don't do their taxes or whatever.</v>

2404
01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:26.640
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2405
01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:27.780
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2406
01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:30.270
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm pretty,</v>

2407
01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:30.631
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2408
01:11:30.631 --> 01:11:30.961
<v Speaker 4>that's a,</v>

2409
01:11:30.961 --> 01:11:34.440
<v Speaker 4>that's a good question because I don't necessarily know about that,</v>

2410
01:11:34.441 --> 01:11:35.400
<v Speaker 4>but I could ask my,</v>

2411
01:11:35.670 --> 01:11:35.911
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>

2412
01:11:35.911 --> 01:11:36.510
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2413
01:11:36.510 --> 01:11:37.740
<v Speaker 4>not necessarily right now,</v>

2414
01:11:38.130 --> 01:11:39.630
<v Speaker 4>I haven't spoken to him in a while.</v>

2415
01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:45.200
<v Speaker 4>My friend Christian who and a Lei Ha and I can't talk to another guy,</v>

2416
01:11:46.441 --> 01:11:46.891
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

2417
01:11:46.891 --> 01:11:50.480
<v Speaker 4>I've had quite a few illegal friends and every single.</v>

2418
01:11:50.910 --> 01:11:51.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2419
01:11:51.690 --> 01:11:54.360
<v Speaker 4>And they pay our taxes than I did at the same.</v>

2420
01:11:54.430 --> 01:11:56.070
<v Speaker 4>It was pretty crazy.</v>

2421
01:11:56.130 --> 01:11:56.521
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2422
01:11:56.521 --> 01:12:00.000
<v Speaker 4>And so the whole idea of illegal is not paying taxes to me,</v>

2423
01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:01.590
<v Speaker 4>maybe true in some,</v>

2424
01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:02.933
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2425
01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:04.290
<v Speaker 4>in some cases,</v>

2426
01:12:04.291 --> 01:12:07.950
<v Speaker 4>but that's certainly not true across the board.</v>

2427
01:12:07.951 --> 01:12:11.220
<v Speaker 4>I mean the irs doesn't give a shit where the money comes from,</v>

2428
01:12:11.221 --> 01:12:12.054
<v Speaker 4>but it's coming,</v>

2429
01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:12.481
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2430
01:12:12.481 --> 01:12:16.860
<v Speaker 4>you're paying into social security and your pain in your paying an income tax</v>

2431
01:12:16.861 --> 01:12:17.250
<v Speaker 4>and if,</v>

2432
01:12:17.250 --> 01:12:19.620
<v Speaker 4>whether or not you're a federal income tax and whether or not you,</v>

2433
01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:21.493
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

2434
01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:23.550
<v Speaker 4>whether another is a state income tax,</v>

2435
01:12:23.670 --> 01:12:25.140
<v Speaker 4>you're paying that too.</v>

2436
01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:26.640
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2437
01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:27.300
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2438
01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:28.133
<v Speaker 4>But</v>

2439
01:12:29.490 --> 01:12:29.940
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2440
01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:30.151
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2441
01:12:30.151 --> 01:12:31.260
<v Speaker 4>there may be ways around it,</v>

2442
01:12:31.261 --> 01:12:34.260
<v Speaker 4>but people that I knew that it didn't,</v>

2443
01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:35.450
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2444
01:12:35.450 --> 01:12:35.851
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2445
01:12:35.851 --> 01:12:36.451
<v Speaker 4>And yeah,</v>

2446
01:12:36.451 --> 01:12:39.210
<v Speaker 4>many also work under the table and there's also that.</v>

2447
01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:40.073
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2448
01:12:40.370 --> 01:12:41.203
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

2449
01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:44.140
<v Speaker 4>I don't necessarily know that all those,</v>

2450
01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:46.353
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2451
01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:47.080
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2452
01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:48.730
<v Speaker 4>the whole trade thing is true,</v>

2453
01:12:48.731 --> 01:12:49.630
<v Speaker 4>but I know that,</v>

2454
01:12:49.690 --> 01:12:50.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2455
01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:51.880
<v Speaker 4>illegals work for less,</v>

2456
01:12:51.881 --> 01:12:53.560
<v Speaker 4>they work longer.</v>

2457
01:12:53.950 --> 01:12:56.680
<v Speaker 4>They don't necessarily produce the same quality of job.</v>

2458
01:12:56.681 --> 01:12:57.910
<v Speaker 4>But in the building industry,</v>

2459
01:12:58.180 --> 01:12:58.421
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2460
01:12:58.421 --> 01:12:59.254
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't matter.</v>

2461
01:12:59.290 --> 01:12:59.650
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2462
01:12:59.650 --> 01:13:01.090
<v Speaker 4>Dr Horton is a,</v>

2463
01:13:03.190 --> 01:13:04.210
<v Speaker 4>probably shouldn't bring that up.</v>

2464
01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:05.073
<v Speaker 4>But</v>

2465
01:13:06.430 --> 01:13:06.701
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2466
01:13:06.701 --> 01:13:07.061
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2467
01:13:07.061 --> 01:13:09.870
<v Speaker 4>so there's this employers,</v>

2468
01:13:10.410 --> 01:13:11.220
<v Speaker 4>employers,</v>

2469
01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:12.053
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2470
01:13:12.850 --> 01:13:15.940
<v Speaker 4>make a lot of money off of quick,</v>

2471
01:13:16.750 --> 01:13:17.583
<v Speaker 4>cheap,</v>

2472
01:13:19.180 --> 01:13:20.630
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2473
01:13:21.730 --> 01:13:22.930
<v Speaker 4>acceptable work</v>

2474
01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:24.313
<v Speaker 8>and uh,</v>

2475
01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:26.113
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>

2476
01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:27.560
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2477
01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:31.510
<v Speaker 3>well there was going to try the companies that I was going to try to make the</v>

2478
01:13:31.511 --> 01:13:33.280
<v Speaker 3>most amount of profit I guess they can,</v>

2479
01:13:33.340 --> 01:13:33.680
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>

2480
01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:35.080
<v Speaker 3>And there's nothing really wrong with that.</v>

2481
01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:35.943
<v Speaker 3>It's just what they do.</v>

2482
01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:36.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2483
01:13:36.410 --> 01:13:37.030
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2484
01:13:37.030 --> 01:13:38.590
<v Speaker 3>so like if you can,</v>

2485
01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:40.600
<v Speaker 3>if you're just looking at it like a,</v>

2486
01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:41.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2487
01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:42.213
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to be,</v>

2488
01:13:42.910 --> 01:13:45.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to say it's hard to put this little words,</v>

2489
01:13:45.971 --> 01:13:48.790
<v Speaker 3>but you're looking at just like as if you're like a gray face,</v>

2490
01:13:49.060 --> 01:13:54.060
<v Speaker 3>neutral vehicle of power trying to manifest wealth,</v>

2491
01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:55.661
<v Speaker 3>then all you're going to do to say,</v>

2492
01:13:55.661 --> 01:13:55.931
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2493
01:13:55.931 --> 01:13:56.500
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

2494
01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:57.970
<v Speaker 3>what's the input and what's the output?</v>

2495
01:13:57.971 --> 01:14:00.850
<v Speaker 3>So am I going to input five bucks and get 10 bucks in value?</v>

2496
01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:02.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to input seven bucks,</v>

2497
01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:03.041
<v Speaker 3>10 bucks,</v>

2498
01:14:03.041 --> 01:14:03.940
<v Speaker 3>and they don't care.</v>

2499
01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:06.580
<v Speaker 3>They'll just go for the one that goes to some of the most value,</v>

2500
01:14:06.581 --> 01:14:07.000
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2501
01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:07.833
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2502
01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:08.913
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2503
01:14:09.130 --> 01:14:09.881
<v Speaker 3>so they,</v>

2504
01:14:09.881 --> 01:14:10.714
<v Speaker 3>they don't,</v>

2505
01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:15.250
<v Speaker 3>don't want necessarily discriminate if they can get away from away with it.</v>

2506
01:14:15.251 --> 01:14:16.420
<v Speaker 3>So whatever the,</v>

2507
01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:18.640
<v Speaker 3>whatever the rules allow for,</v>

2508
01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:20.160
<v Speaker 3>they're just going to go for.</v>

2509
01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:21.340
<v Speaker 3>And the rules aren't being enforced.</v>

2510
01:14:21.341 --> 01:14:22.420
<v Speaker 3>That just means the rules aren't,</v>

2511
01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:23.953
<v Speaker 3>don't have to worry about them.</v>

2512
01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:27.430
<v Speaker 3>There's no rules that have no power behind them are worth plus.</v>

2513
01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:30.310
<v Speaker 3>So if the state isn't x,</v>

2514
01:14:30.910 --> 01:14:31.743
<v Speaker 3>what do you call it?</v>

2515
01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:33.880
<v Speaker 3>Deporting people that are illegal,</v>

2516
01:14:33.881 --> 01:14:34.360
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>

2517
01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:35.260
<v Speaker 3>well who cares?</v>

2518
01:14:35.261 --> 01:14:36.090
<v Speaker 3>They'll just hire them.</v>

2519
01:14:36.090 --> 01:14:36.520
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2520
01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:40.660
<v Speaker 3>doesn't make a difference to them ultimately because ultimately they're not the</v>

2521
01:14:40.661 --> 01:14:41.810
<v Speaker 3>one that didn't think wrong.</v>

2522
01:14:41.811 --> 01:14:44.060
<v Speaker 3>They're just looking at the labor markets of free market.</v>

2523
01:14:44.070 --> 01:14:44.331
<v Speaker 3>The states,</v>

2524
01:14:44.331 --> 01:14:45.430
<v Speaker 3>it's really open that way</v>

2525
01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:48.700
<v Speaker 3>and they just hire whoever.</v>

2526
01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:50.140
<v Speaker 3>Like in Iceland for example,</v>

2527
01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:52.060
<v Speaker 3>in order to work at any job,</v>

2528
01:14:52.061 --> 01:14:56.650
<v Speaker 3>you need to get some like government id and the end you need to like,</v>

2529
01:14:56.740 --> 01:15:00.820
<v Speaker 3>we registered that then and then when you get a new one join a company,</v>

2530
01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:04.240
<v Speaker 3>you automatically joined the union that's associated with that line of work,</v>

2531
01:15:05.290 --> 01:15:06.940
<v Speaker 3>which is another weird thing because like,</v>

2532
01:15:07.090 --> 01:15:11.850
<v Speaker 3>usually unions are like free association and all the unions are essentially a,</v>

2533
01:15:12.460 --> 01:15:13.810
<v Speaker 3>they'd negotiate separately.</v>

2534
01:15:14.810 --> 01:15:15.643
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2535
01:15:16.830 --> 01:15:19.740
<v Speaker 3>with her or like her.</v>

2536
01:15:19.970 --> 01:15:22.710
<v Speaker 3>It's like all the guys that we're going to fast food restaurants while the,</v>

2537
01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:23.800
<v Speaker 3>not just a,</v>

2538
01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:25.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm just making this up because I,</v>

2539
01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:27.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the specific example.</v>

2540
01:15:28.350 --> 01:15:29.070
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>

2541
01:15:29.070 --> 01:15:34.070
<v Speaker 3>all the plumbers will be in the same union and everyone has to be in that union</v>

2542
01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:35.040
<v Speaker 3>affair.</v>

2543
01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:35.873
<v Speaker 3>Palmer,</v>

2544
01:15:36.150 --> 01:15:36.983
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2545
01:15:37.270 --> 01:15:37.950
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2546
01:15:37.950 --> 01:15:38.330
<v Speaker 3>but in,</v>

2547
01:15:38.330 --> 01:15:39.330
<v Speaker 3>in the states you can be,</v>

2548
01:15:39.420 --> 01:15:40.440
<v Speaker 3>you can be your own plumber,</v>

2549
01:15:40.441 --> 01:15:41.670
<v Speaker 3>like you can have your own business.</v>

2550
01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:42.583
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2551
01:15:42.690 --> 01:15:44.680
<v Speaker 3>he can be part of a company that's unionized,</v>

2552
01:15:44.690 --> 01:15:46.170
<v Speaker 3>we part of the company that isn't unionized,</v>

2553
01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:48.390
<v Speaker 3>so that changes from state to state.</v>

2554
01:15:48.391 --> 01:15:48.691
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

2555
01:15:48.691 --> 01:15:49.524
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>

2556
01:15:49.590 --> 01:15:51.810
<v Speaker 3>Some states are full union,</v>

2557
01:15:57.110 --> 01:15:58.980
<v Speaker 3>like a</v>

2558
01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:03.330
<v Speaker 3>in areas like,</v>

2559
01:16:03.331 --> 01:16:04.164
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2560
01:16:05.650 --> 01:16:07.210
<v Speaker 3>Indiana is a,</v>

2561
01:16:09.970 --> 01:16:11.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure exactly how it works,</v>

2562
01:16:11.831 --> 01:16:12.664
<v Speaker 3>but it's a,</v>

2563
01:16:13.420 --> 01:16:14.830
<v Speaker 3>it's not a right to work state.</v>

2564
01:16:15.490 --> 01:16:16.323
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

2565
01:16:16.510 --> 01:16:18.460
<v Speaker 3>at least for some of the trades.</v>

2566
01:16:18.461 --> 01:16:19.294
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how.</v>

2567
01:16:20.660 --> 01:16:22.240
<v Speaker 3>I don't know exactly how it is now.</v>

2568
01:16:24.070 --> 01:16:24.903
<v Speaker 3>It makes sense,</v>

2569
01:16:25.150 --> 01:16:26.000
<v Speaker 3>but it would,</v>

2570
01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:26.861
<v Speaker 3>it would vary.</v>

2571
01:16:26.861 --> 01:16:27.820
<v Speaker 3>The states are very,</v>

2572
01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:29.620
<v Speaker 3>very different between each one.</v>

2573
01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:29.921
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2574
01:16:29.921 --> 01:16:30.754
<v Speaker 3>In Florida,</v>

2575
01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:31.640
<v Speaker 3>in Florida,</v>

2576
01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:35.260
<v Speaker 3>there's no unions in Illinois and Indiana.</v>

2577
01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:36.670
<v Speaker 3>It's heavily unionized.</v>

2578
01:16:36.671 --> 01:16:37.121
<v Speaker 3>In Indiana,</v>

2579
01:16:37.121 --> 01:16:37.954
<v Speaker 3>especially</v>

2580
01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:41.370
<v Speaker 3>for there's no unions.</v>

2581
01:16:41.890 --> 01:16:42.723
<v Speaker 3>Well</v>

2582
01:16:43.970 --> 01:16:44.803
<v Speaker 3>or very few.</v>

2583
01:16:47.150 --> 01:16:47.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2584
01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:48.410
<v Speaker 3>probably very few.</v>

2585
01:16:48.650 --> 01:16:49.580
<v Speaker 3>I don't know none,</v>

2586
01:16:49.700 --> 01:16:50.570
<v Speaker 3>but there's no,</v>

2587
01:16:50.900 --> 01:16:51.733
<v Speaker 3>there's no</v>

2588
01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:56.030
<v Speaker 3>let me maybe south Florida,</v>

2589
01:16:56.390 --> 01:16:57.170
<v Speaker 3>Miami,</v>

2590
01:16:57.170 --> 01:16:58.020
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2591
01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:01.940
<v Speaker 3>some people considered south Florida be almost a different state because of how</v>

2592
01:17:02.410 --> 01:17:03.100
<v Speaker 3>you know it,</v>

2593
01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:05.390
<v Speaker 3>it just doesn't like North Florida,</v>

2594
01:17:05.391 --> 01:17:06.350
<v Speaker 3>central Florida,</v>

2595
01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:10.160
<v Speaker 3>West northwest Florida or the don't</v>

2596
01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:12.590
<v Speaker 1>compare at all compared to the,</v>

2597
01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:13.453
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2598
01:17:17.090 --> 01:17:19.820
<v Speaker 1>we can get to the economic generation.</v>

2599
01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:24.230
<v Speaker 1>Did the income generation of south Florida.</v>

2600
01:17:24.231 --> 01:17:26.200
<v Speaker 1>None of them compare Florida carpet.</v>

2601
01:17:26.220 --> 01:17:26.781
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a,</v>

2602
01:17:26.781 --> 01:17:28.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's a Florida carpenters union.</v>

2603
01:17:30.030 --> 01:17:30.381
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2604
01:17:30.381 --> 01:17:31.141
<v Speaker 3>I remember the,</v>

2605
01:17:31.141 --> 01:17:31.351
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2606
01:17:31.351 --> 01:17:32.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually a member of union myself,</v>

2607
01:17:33.030 --> 01:17:35.190
<v Speaker 3>but I don't really have a choice as the IBW</v>

2608
01:17:35.380 --> 01:17:38.530
<v Speaker 1>that inter national brotherhood of electrical workers.</v>

2609
01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:39.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2610
01:17:39.130 --> 01:17:40.240
<v Speaker 1>they do have a union,</v>

2611
01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:41.501
<v Speaker 1>but guess what?</v>

2612
01:17:41.501 --> 01:17:42.460
<v Speaker 1>It's in south Florida.</v>

2613
01:17:42.970 --> 01:17:44.470
<v Speaker 1>It's in Tampa.</v>

2614
01:17:44.620 --> 01:17:45.453
<v Speaker 1>Orlando,</v>

2615
01:17:46.150 --> 01:17:48.220
<v Speaker 1>I guess we'll land is still considered central,</v>

2616
01:17:48.221 --> 01:17:49.480
<v Speaker 1>but that's where the,</v>

2617
01:17:50.170 --> 01:17:51.100
<v Speaker 1>that's where the money's at.</v>

2618
01:17:51.101 --> 01:17:51.934
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2619
01:17:52.210 --> 01:17:53.043
<v Speaker 1>you don't have money.</v>

2620
01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:56.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2621
01:17:56.150 --> 01:17:57.820
<v Speaker 1>what's the penalty like anyways?</v>

2622
01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:00.640
<v Speaker 1>Have heavily military.</v>

2623
01:18:00.970 --> 01:18:01.803
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's.</v>

2624
01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:03.041
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

2625
01:18:03.041 --> 01:18:03.641
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

2626
01:18:03.641 --> 01:18:03.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2627
01:18:03.970 --> 01:18:06.640
<v Speaker 1>Eggland Hurlbert with your air force bases.</v>

2628
01:18:07.010 --> 01:18:08.410
<v Speaker 1>Tyndall was an air force base,</v>

2629
01:18:08.411 --> 01:18:11.350
<v Speaker 1>but it was just destroyed by a hurricane Michael.</v>

2630
01:18:11.980 --> 01:18:12.813
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2631
01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:17.240
<v Speaker 1>and then you've got duke field which is an army a.</v>

2632
01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:18.233
<v Speaker 1>Then you got it.</v>

2633
01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:20.710
<v Speaker 1>You got a navy base here.</v>

2634
01:18:20.770 --> 01:18:21.603
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's</v>

2635
01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:23.863
<v Speaker 1>the majority.</v>

2636
01:18:23.950 --> 01:18:26.830
<v Speaker 1>I honestly believe except for like the resort coastline,</v>

2637
01:18:26.831 --> 01:18:30.550
<v Speaker 1>like destin 30 a Panama city,</v>

2638
01:18:30.850 --> 01:18:32.050
<v Speaker 1>parts of Pensacola,</v>

2639
01:18:32.350 --> 01:18:32.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2640
01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:34.570
<v Speaker 1>if it weren't for the middle of your living in,</v>

2641
01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:35.950
<v Speaker 1>in the areas,</v>

2642
01:18:36.110 --> 01:18:41.110
<v Speaker 1>then this wouldn't be the type of area that it wouldn't have the same</v>

2643
01:18:42.730 --> 01:18:44.290
<v Speaker 1>development that it has,</v>

2644
01:18:44.380 --> 01:18:45.610
<v Speaker 1>like in 2008,</v>

2645
01:18:45.630 --> 01:18:45.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2646
01:18:45.910 --> 01:18:47.140
<v Speaker 1>it didn't see the same,</v>

2647
01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:47.830
<v Speaker 1>didn't.</v>

2648
01:18:47.830 --> 01:18:49.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean everybody was affected in 2008.</v>

2649
01:18:49.990 --> 01:18:50.823
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2650
01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:51.281
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2651
01:18:51.281 --> 01:18:52.220
<v Speaker 1>everything got tighter.</v>

2652
01:18:52.540 --> 01:18:53.260
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2653
01:18:53.260 --> 01:18:54.093
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2654
01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:58.630
<v Speaker 1>I think the military really helped this area kind of move forward.</v>

2655
01:19:01.230 --> 01:19:01.591
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2656
01:19:01.591 --> 01:19:02.424
<v Speaker 3>it helps.</v>

2657
01:19:02.490 --> 01:19:02.731
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2658
01:19:02.731 --> 01:19:02.970
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2659
01:19:02.970 --> 01:19:03.331
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2660
01:19:03.331 --> 01:19:03.610
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2661
01:19:03.610 --> 01:19:05.610
<v Speaker 3>I have a buddy that lives in mobile.</v>

2662
01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:08.190
<v Speaker 3>I think that's pretty close.</v>

2663
01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:11.490
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty close to the pan on Alabama.</v>

2664
01:19:11.790 --> 01:19:11.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2665
01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:13.620
<v Speaker 3>I've driven through there a couple of times.</v>

2666
01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:16.053
<v Speaker 3>That's cool.</v>

2667
01:19:16.570 --> 01:19:17.020
<v Speaker 3>I was doing.</v>

2668
01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:17.950
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever do any answers?</v>

2669
01:19:18.010 --> 01:19:20.730
<v Speaker 1>The research I've ever done that A.</v>

2670
01:19:20.731 --> 01:19:21.564
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2671
01:19:21.630 --> 01:19:21.961
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2672
01:19:21.961 --> 01:19:22.794
<v Speaker 1>a little bit.</v>

2673
01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:25.050
<v Speaker 1>Not so much as submit blood or anything like that,</v>

2674
01:19:25.051 --> 01:19:25.830
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

2675
01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:26.880
<v Speaker 1>or however that works.</v>

2676
01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:28.890
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

2677
01:19:28.980 --> 01:19:30.430
<v Speaker 1>I know a little bit of a,</v>

2678
01:19:31.550 --> 01:19:31.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2679
01:19:31.940 --> 01:19:33.000
<v Speaker 1>my father's side,</v>

2680
01:19:33.260 --> 01:19:33.421
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2681
01:19:33.421 --> 01:19:38.421
<v Speaker 1>their family came from Italy as dad's and mom's side.</v>

2682
01:19:39.001 --> 01:19:39.834
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

2683
01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:42.310
<v Speaker 1>had lived in the states here for awhile,</v>

2684
01:19:42.330 --> 01:19:44.730
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know where in Europe they came from.</v>

2685
01:19:45.290 --> 01:19:45.590
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2686
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:48.030
<v Speaker 1>and then my mom's side mom was British,</v>

2687
01:19:48.130 --> 01:19:49.560
<v Speaker 1>so maybe you brought that up for different reasons.</v>

2688
01:19:49.561 --> 01:19:51.420
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't just start rattling off.</v>

2689
01:19:51.790 --> 01:19:52.623
<v Speaker 3>Oh no,</v>

2690
01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:53.350
<v Speaker 3>it's fine.</v>

2691
01:19:53.350 --> 01:19:53.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2692
01:19:53.690 --> 01:19:53.910
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2693
01:19:53.910 --> 01:19:54.581
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

2694
01:19:54.581 --> 01:19:54.910
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2695
01:19:54.910 --> 01:19:58.120
<v Speaker 3>I was a lot of family that came from the states,</v>

2696
01:19:59.230 --> 01:20:00.520
<v Speaker 3>like North Carolina,</v>

2697
01:20:00.590 --> 01:20:04.210
<v Speaker 3>like a western North Carolina and like northern Arkansas,</v>

2698
01:20:05.420 --> 01:20:06.253
<v Speaker 3>another origin.</v>

2699
01:20:06.550 --> 01:20:07.830
<v Speaker 3>And I was because like,</v>

2700
01:20:07.831 --> 01:20:08.664
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2701
01:20:09.340 --> 01:20:11.820
<v Speaker 3>apparently one of my grant,</v>

2702
01:20:11.850 --> 01:20:12.690
<v Speaker 3>I got my grant,</v>

2703
01:20:12.691 --> 01:20:13.261
<v Speaker 3>my mums,</v>

2704
01:20:13.261 --> 01:20:15.360
<v Speaker 3>dads like great grandfather,</v>

2705
01:20:15.361 --> 01:20:15.631
<v Speaker 3>great,</v>

2706
01:20:15.631 --> 01:20:16.464
<v Speaker 3>great grandfather.</v>

2707
01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:22.100
<v Speaker 3>He was apparently like a slave owner at some point and uh,</v>

2708
01:20:22.950 --> 01:20:27.950
<v Speaker 3>he sold as slaves before the war ended in New Orleans and then move and move</v>

2709
01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:30.320
<v Speaker 3>yourself a Yellville,</v>

2710
01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:34.800
<v Speaker 3>Arkansas and buried the gold there because you sold them for gold.</v>

2711
01:20:35.910 --> 01:20:36.391
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2712
01:20:36.391 --> 01:20:37.520
<v Speaker 3>I was always a,</v>

2713
01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:41.000
<v Speaker 3>I know the location of the farm and I was always curious like is he.</v>

2714
01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:44.310
<v Speaker 3>They said he forgot where he buried it so it might still be there.</v>

2715
01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:46.681
<v Speaker 3>So I was like,</v>

2716
01:20:46.681 --> 01:20:46.831
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2717
01:20:46.831 --> 01:20:47.300
<v Speaker 3>I wonder.</v>

2718
01:20:47.300 --> 01:20:48.190
<v Speaker 3>And I looked at the Va,</v>

2719
01:20:48.270 --> 01:20:50.490
<v Speaker 3>it was $30,000 of gold at the time,</v>

2720
01:20:50.610 --> 01:20:52.020
<v Speaker 3>which is like 2 million bucks now.</v>

2721
01:20:52.410 --> 01:20:53.100
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

2722
01:20:53.100 --> 01:20:55.170
<v Speaker 3>So I mean I feel like I'd feel,</v>

2723
01:20:55.260 --> 01:20:56.130
<v Speaker 3>I feel kind of bad,</v>

2724
01:20:56.131 --> 01:20:56.964
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

2725
01:20:58.110 --> 01:20:58.943
<v Speaker 3>you should,</v>

2726
01:20:59.970 --> 01:21:01.740
<v Speaker 3>you should search it out.</v>

2727
01:21:01.741 --> 01:21:02.574
<v Speaker 3>I'd look for it.</v>

2728
01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:04.171
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2729
01:21:04.171 --> 01:21:04.420
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2730
01:21:04.420 --> 01:21:04.781
<v Speaker 3>I gotta,</v>

2731
01:21:04.781 --> 01:21:07.680
<v Speaker 3>I gotTa kind of location by that I mean the study looking for a needle in a</v>

2732
01:21:07.681 --> 01:21:08.161
<v Speaker 3>haystack,</v>

2733
01:21:08.161 --> 01:21:08.990
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2734
01:21:08.990 --> 01:21:09.823
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2735
01:21:09.910 --> 01:21:10.980
<v Speaker 3>It may be worse.</v>

2736
01:21:11.820 --> 01:21:16.710
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you have excavating equipment or the types of machines that you could</v>

2737
01:21:17.670 --> 01:21:18.690
<v Speaker 3>find things in the ground,</v>

2738
01:21:18.691 --> 01:21:19.620
<v Speaker 3>you might be able to find it.</v>

2739
01:21:19.621 --> 01:21:20.454
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2740
01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:22.470
<v Speaker 3>Or I could buy the farm.</v>

2741
01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:26.640
<v Speaker 3>I think I could buy the farm for 120 grand then just start digging.</v>

2742
01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:30.113
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

2743
01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:33.480
<v Speaker 3>I've done a lot of interesting research to over the years.</v>

2744
01:21:34.050 --> 01:21:35.370
<v Speaker 3>I traced some of my family,</v>

2745
01:21:35.380 --> 01:21:36.930
<v Speaker 3>like I trace my family back there,</v>

2746
01:21:36.931 --> 01:21:38.550
<v Speaker 3>my dad's mother.</v>

2747
01:21:38.551 --> 01:21:39.420
<v Speaker 3>So my grandmother,</v>

2748
01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:41.430
<v Speaker 3>her grant,</v>

2749
01:21:41.550 --> 01:21:43.050
<v Speaker 3>her father's mother,</v>

2750
01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:47.410
<v Speaker 3>I traced her family back to England king.</v>

2751
01:21:47.490 --> 01:21:48.020
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2752
01:21:48.020 --> 01:21:53.020
<v Speaker 3>it was like the maternal grandfather of a ethelred,</v>

2753
01:21:53.251 --> 01:21:54.030
<v Speaker 3>the unready.</v>

2754
01:21:54.030 --> 01:21:55.140
<v Speaker 3>It was like the King of England.</v>

2755
01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:56.333
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2756
01:21:57.120 --> 01:22:00.540
<v Speaker 3>Which is pretty cool and I think if most people were to trace their family back,</v>

2757
01:22:00.541 --> 01:22:02.880
<v Speaker 3>you'd actually find those links because</v>

2758
01:22:05.070 --> 01:22:06.270
<v Speaker 3>it really expands.</v>

2759
01:22:06.271 --> 01:22:07.230
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

2760
01:22:07.231 --> 01:22:07.411
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2761
01:22:07.411 --> 01:22:09.090
<v Speaker 3>you have to give to parents,</v>

2762
01:22:09.091 --> 01:22:09.780
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2763
01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:11.190
<v Speaker 3>Then each one of them have two parents,</v>

2764
01:22:11.191 --> 01:22:11.610
<v Speaker 3>so then,</v>

2765
01:22:11.610 --> 01:22:14.670
<v Speaker 3>so you have four grandparents and so on doubles every time,</v>

2766
01:22:14.990 --> 01:22:19.860
<v Speaker 3>10 generations and you're like a thousand up to a thousand unique ancestors,</v>

2767
01:22:20.310 --> 01:22:21.143
<v Speaker 3>which is actually really,</v>

2768
01:22:21.170 --> 01:22:22.170
<v Speaker 3>which is really unlikely.</v>

2769
01:22:22.171 --> 01:22:25.110
<v Speaker 3>You'd probably have a lot less because there's like some inbreeding that happens</v>

2770
01:22:25.111 --> 01:22:25.944
<v Speaker 3>at that level.</v>

2771
01:22:26.150 --> 01:22:26.983
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2772
01:22:27.270 --> 01:22:32.270
<v Speaker 3>you'll probably find that at some point your parents or some level of cousin.</v>

2773
01:22:33.030 --> 01:22:37.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm like sixth or fifth or later,</v>

2774
01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:38.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2775
01:22:38.130 --> 01:22:41.430
<v Speaker 3>usually not closer than that unless it was like some sort of pathology going on</v>

2776
01:22:41.431 --> 01:22:42.264
<v Speaker 3>in the area.</v>

2777
01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:43.223
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

2778
01:22:43.260 --> 01:22:43.830
<v Speaker 3>like I was,</v>

2779
01:22:43.830 --> 01:22:44.510
<v Speaker 3>I was able to.</v>

2780
01:22:44.510 --> 01:22:45.360
<v Speaker 3>So my parents,</v>

2781
01:22:45.390 --> 01:22:48.810
<v Speaker 3>they or their family's origin from completely different parts of the gay.</v>

2782
01:22:49.460 --> 01:22:50.160
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2783
01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:52.770
<v Speaker 3>but I found like common relatives between them,</v>

2784
01:22:52.771 --> 01:22:54.780
<v Speaker 3>which is really weird that I've done.</v>

2785
01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:58.650
<v Speaker 3>I did the math on it because you can't really locate because they show up as not</v>

2786
01:22:58.651 --> 01:22:59.041
<v Speaker 3>related.</v>

2787
01:22:59.041 --> 01:22:59.730
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2788
01:22:59.730 --> 01:23:02.430
<v Speaker 3>But you can find people that are related to a share like the,</v>

2789
01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:05.460
<v Speaker 3>like they share like a third or fourth cousin or,</v>

2790
01:23:05.550 --> 01:23:06.383
<v Speaker 3>or later.</v>

2791
01:23:06.550 --> 01:23:07.330
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2792
01:23:07.330 --> 01:23:08.410
<v Speaker 3>and from there you can see like,</v>

2793
01:23:08.411 --> 01:23:08.651
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2794
01:23:08.651 --> 01:23:12.580
<v Speaker 3>well if they shared just if I shared this much with them and they share that</v>

2795
01:23:12.581 --> 01:23:13.061
<v Speaker 3>much with them,</v>

2796
01:23:13.061 --> 01:23:16.990
<v Speaker 3>that means they were related at some point so you can kind of triangulate from</v>

2797
01:23:16.991 --> 01:23:17.680
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2798
01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:18.191
<v Speaker 3>So I found it.</v>

2799
01:23:18.191 --> 01:23:21.310
<v Speaker 3>My parents were like 7:38 cousins or something like that.</v>

2800
01:23:22.180 --> 01:23:23.013
<v Speaker 3>It's an estimate,</v>

2801
01:23:23.110 --> 01:23:23.943
<v Speaker 3>it's an estimate.</v>

2802
01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:25.510
<v Speaker 3>But you'll find that the people are like,</v>

2803
01:23:25.511 --> 01:23:26.440
<v Speaker 3>oh that's kind of fucked up.</v>

2804
01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:31.360
<v Speaker 3>But then you find out that they're probably even closer related depending on</v>

2805
01:23:32.510 --> 01:23:33.281
<v Speaker 3>where they lived.</v>

2806
01:23:33.281 --> 01:23:34.030
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2807
01:23:34.030 --> 01:23:36.580
<v Speaker 3>So like if you lived in the same county in England,</v>

2808
01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:39.570
<v Speaker 3>your chances of being like third cousin or closer?</v>

2809
01:23:39.590 --> 01:23:40.630
<v Speaker 3>Actually quite high.</v>

2810
01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:45.600
<v Speaker 3>So I guess it's Kinda Kinda get some kind of.</v>

2811
01:23:46.970 --> 01:23:51.760
<v Speaker 3>But third cousin though you're like basically not related like a all,</v>

2812
01:23:51.970 --> 01:23:53.710
<v Speaker 3>like you might not even match with them.</v>

2813
01:23:54.670 --> 01:23:56.770
<v Speaker 3>So at that level it's not really that bad.</v>

2814
01:23:56.890 --> 01:23:58.170
<v Speaker 3>It's the main problem.</v>

2815
01:23:58.180 --> 01:24:00.800
<v Speaker 3>The major problem with a cousin,</v>

2816
01:24:01.570 --> 01:24:03.070
<v Speaker 3>I guess you call it sanguish,</v>

2817
01:24:03.670 --> 01:24:06.210
<v Speaker 3>consanguineous marriages is like,</v>

2818
01:24:06.940 --> 01:24:07.331
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

2819
01:24:07.331 --> 01:24:08.170
<v Speaker 3>in Muslim countries,</v>

2820
01:24:08.171 --> 01:24:11.650
<v Speaker 3>they made their cousins a lot like first in Pakistan especially I think 50</v>

2821
01:24:11.651 --> 01:24:15.250
<v Speaker 3>percent or 40 percent of the marriages are like second cousin or closer.</v>

2822
01:24:16.460 --> 01:24:17.293
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2823
01:24:17.860 --> 01:24:19.720
<v Speaker 3>so what happens is if you,</v>

2824
01:24:19.721 --> 01:24:21.090
<v Speaker 3>so if you marry your cousin,</v>

2825
01:24:21.150 --> 01:24:24.820
<v Speaker 3>you have kids and your kids married their cousin and this happens,</v>

2826
01:24:24.821 --> 01:24:24.971
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2827
01:24:24.971 --> 01:24:26.170
<v Speaker 3>You look a compound.</v>

2828
01:24:27.230 --> 01:24:30.340
<v Speaker 3>So the regular rate of like genetic disease,</v>

2829
01:24:30.341 --> 01:24:31.850
<v Speaker 3>I think if you just made,</v>

2830
01:24:31.870 --> 01:24:34.630
<v Speaker 3>if you have a kid with some random person from the other side of the world,</v>

2831
01:24:34.900 --> 01:24:35.800
<v Speaker 3>it's like three percent.</v>

2832
01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:37.850
<v Speaker 3>But if you're,</v>

2833
01:24:37.850 --> 01:24:40.870
<v Speaker 3>if you're like in a line of first cousins that kept getting married,</v>

2834
01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:43.060
<v Speaker 3>it's like 12 to 13 percent.</v>

2835
01:24:43.090 --> 01:24:43.960
<v Speaker 3>I think it maxes out.</v>

2836
01:24:44.170 --> 01:24:45.610
<v Speaker 3>Maxes out ABS are at.</v>

2837
01:24:46.150 --> 01:24:46.950
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2838
01:24:46.950 --> 01:24:47.141
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2839
01:24:47.141 --> 01:24:48.430
<v Speaker 3>with these small towns in England,</v>

2840
01:24:48.431 --> 01:24:49.900
<v Speaker 3>do you use to get a lot of these problems?</v>

2841
01:24:50.650 --> 01:24:51.760
<v Speaker 3>But then when they started,</v>

2842
01:24:51.761 --> 01:24:52.090
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2843
01:24:52.090 --> 01:24:52.540
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2844
01:24:52.540 --> 01:24:53.710
<v Speaker 3>so when they went to the states,</v>

2845
01:24:53.711 --> 01:24:55.180
<v Speaker 3>there's not like a lot of English people there.</v>

2846
01:24:55.181 --> 01:24:56.410
<v Speaker 3>So they'd have to like Mary,</v>

2847
01:24:56.411 --> 01:25:00.640
<v Speaker 3>like Spanish or French or Italian or Irish or whatever.</v>

2848
01:25:00.970 --> 01:25:01.840
<v Speaker 3>Whoever was available.</v>

2849
01:25:01.841 --> 01:25:02.060
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2850
01:25:02.060 --> 01:25:03.160
<v Speaker 3>The market is quite different.</v>

2851
01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:04.413
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2852
01:25:05.230 --> 01:25:06.550
<v Speaker 3>So you got like a,</v>

2853
01:25:07.150 --> 01:25:10.300
<v Speaker 3>that problem sort of sort of started to disappear in the new role.</v>

2854
01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:14.560
<v Speaker 3>But in the old world that kind of still happens like New Zealand and stuff too.</v>

2855
01:25:16.660 --> 01:25:17.493
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

2856
01:25:19.510 --> 01:25:19.820
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2857
01:25:19.820 --> 01:25:20.653
<v Speaker 3>it's been uh,</v>

2858
01:25:20.830 --> 01:25:21.190
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2859
01:25:21.190 --> 01:25:21.440
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2860
01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:23.480
<v Speaker 3>if you ever get the chance to look into um,</v>

2861
01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:28.210
<v Speaker 3>your ancestry is kind of interesting because you find out a lot of stuff that</v>

2862
01:25:28.630 --> 01:25:29.140
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

2863
01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:31.700
<v Speaker 3>if you don't find it out in sort of store,</v>

2864
01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:33.760
<v Speaker 3>it is this kind of knowledge that gets lost forever.</v>

2865
01:25:35.050 --> 01:25:35.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2866
01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:36.251
<v Speaker 3>definitely.</v>

2867
01:25:36.251 --> 01:25:37.084
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>

2868
01:25:37.260 --> 01:25:41.200
<v Speaker 3>I hadn't ever looked into it a to know that much.</v>

2869
01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:43.481
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2870
01:25:43.481 --> 01:25:46.660
<v Speaker 3>I found my great grandfather who was kind of a strange because he had like three</v>

2871
01:25:46.661 --> 01:25:47.530
<v Speaker 3>families and my grandma,</v>

2872
01:25:47.570 --> 01:25:50.170
<v Speaker 3>my grandfather was like in his second family,</v>

2873
01:25:51.070 --> 01:25:52.720
<v Speaker 3>he just kept like abandoning families.</v>

2874
01:25:53.290 --> 01:25:53.740
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2875
01:25:53.740 --> 01:25:55.610
<v Speaker 3>but I found out that he had like two different colored eyes.</v>

2876
01:25:55.611 --> 01:25:55.931
<v Speaker 3>So I was like,</v>

2877
01:25:55.931 --> 01:25:56.171
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2878
01:25:56.171 --> 01:25:57.004
<v Speaker 3>what's up with that?</v>

2879
01:25:57.150 --> 01:25:57.983
<v Speaker 3>Apparently it's like,</v>

2880
01:25:58.020 --> 01:25:59.430
<v Speaker 3>it could be time Arizona,</v>

2881
01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:03.260
<v Speaker 3>which is a think I'm going to talk to you about this last night</v>

2882
01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:07.070
<v Speaker 5>because I have like a split brain or something like that,</v>

2883
01:26:07.150 --> 01:26:07.490
<v Speaker 5>but I was,</v>

2884
01:26:07.490 --> 01:26:10.190
<v Speaker 5>I was curious like if you had tried mannerism and his brain was,</v>

2885
01:26:10.290 --> 01:26:11.360
<v Speaker 5>you had a split brain,</v>

2886
01:26:11.630 --> 01:26:13.100
<v Speaker 5>if that was related to the,</v>

2887
01:26:13.101 --> 01:26:13.700
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2888
01:26:13.700 --> 01:26:16.150
<v Speaker 5>if that might've been the reason why I kept breaking up in this family.</v>

2889
01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:16.993
<v Speaker 5>It's like leaving.</v>

2890
01:26:18.170 --> 01:26:19.003
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2891
01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:19.700
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

2892
01:26:19.700 --> 01:26:20.533
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember.</v>

2893
01:26:20.740 --> 01:26:24.160
<v Speaker 5>So I was just being often optimum and</v>

2894
01:26:25.710 --> 01:26:25.940
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2895
01:26:25.940 --> 01:26:26.421
<v Speaker 5>it was just popped.</v>

2896
01:26:26.421 --> 01:26:27.111
<v Speaker 5>It popped into my head.</v>

2897
01:26:27.111 --> 01:26:27.290
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>

2898
01:26:27.290 --> 01:26:28.250
<v Speaker 5>I found out where he was born,</v>

2899
01:26:28.251 --> 01:26:33.040
<v Speaker 5>like within 100 meters and a in Scotland though,</v>

2900
01:26:33.110 --> 01:26:34.180
<v Speaker 5>I'm only actually a third,</v>

2901
01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:35.450
<v Speaker 5>third generation Canadian.</v>

2902
01:26:37.170 --> 01:26:37.501
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2903
01:26:37.501 --> 01:26:38.151
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2904
01:26:38.151 --> 01:26:38.984
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2905
01:26:39.420 --> 01:26:39.811
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2906
01:26:39.811 --> 01:26:40.644
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2907
01:26:42.490 --> 01:26:43.323
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

2908
01:26:45.450 --> 01:26:46.080
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

2909
01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:46.471
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

2910
01:26:46.471 --> 01:26:51.471
<v Speaker 1>three I think would the second or third generation American from my.</v>

2911
01:26:52.380 --> 01:26:53.060
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2912
01:26:53.060 --> 01:26:53.990
<v Speaker 5>Your grandparents,</v>

2913
01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:56.060
<v Speaker 5>your grandparents were born in the USA.</v>

2914
01:26:56.061 --> 01:26:56.894
<v Speaker 5>You'd be third?</v>

2915
01:26:57.480 --> 01:26:57.691
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2916
01:26:57.691 --> 01:26:57.871
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2917
01:26:57.871 --> 01:26:58.704
<v Speaker 1>they were born.</v>

2918
01:26:59.100 --> 01:26:59.933
<v Speaker 1>They were born in.</v>

2919
01:27:00.930 --> 01:27:02.460
<v Speaker 1>One of my grandparents were born in Italy.</v>

2920
01:27:02.490 --> 01:27:04.530
<v Speaker 1>One of my grandparents was born in England.</v>

2921
01:27:04.950 --> 01:27:09.950
<v Speaker 1>One of my grandparents was born here in the states and another one was born in</v>

2922
01:27:10.561 --> 01:27:11.041
<v Speaker 1>the states,</v>

2923
01:27:11.041 --> 01:27:12.240
<v Speaker 1>one in Illinois,</v>

2924
01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:15.480
<v Speaker 1>close to Lincoln and one of them,</v>

2925
01:27:15.660 --> 01:27:16.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2926
01:27:16.140 --> 01:27:18.180
<v Speaker 1>in West Virginia.</v>

2927
01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:22.313
<v Speaker 5>That's cool.</v>

2928
01:27:23.650 --> 01:27:24.483
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2929
01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:28.120
<v Speaker 5>the earliest ancestor app is like someone that was born in</v>

2930
01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:30.790
<v Speaker 5>17,</v>

2931
01:27:30.820 --> 01:27:33.670
<v Speaker 5>76 or something like that in Virginia.</v>

2932
01:27:36.190 --> 01:27:38.490
<v Speaker 5>So it was my earliest relative,</v>

2933
01:27:38.550 --> 01:27:39.150
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

2934
01:27:39.150 --> 01:27:39.310
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2935
01:27:39.310 --> 01:27:39.510
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>

2936
01:27:39.510 --> 01:27:39.830
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>

2937
01:27:39.830 --> 01:27:41.020
<v Speaker 5>in North America anyways.</v>

2938
01:27:41.870 --> 01:27:42.703
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2939
01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:44.473
<v Speaker 5>But no.</v>

2940
01:27:47.460 --> 01:27:48.690
<v Speaker 5>Any other topics you want to talk about?</v>

2941
01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:50.340
<v Speaker 5>I got some more if you're interested,</v>

2942
01:27:50.341 --> 01:27:51.420
<v Speaker 5>but I have to pull them up.</v>

2943
01:27:52.470 --> 01:27:52.940
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2944
01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:53.773
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2945
01:27:53.780 --> 01:27:54.610
<v Speaker 5>if you give me a sec.</v>

2946
01:27:54.610 --> 01:27:55.590
<v Speaker 5>Are you going to use the bathroom?</v>

2947
01:27:55.650 --> 01:27:56.483
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

2948
01:27:56.990 --> 01:27:57.211
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

2949
01:27:57.211 --> 01:27:57.950
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>

2950
01:27:57.950 --> 01:28:01.470
<v Speaker 5>Just give me posted if I can say I'll see if I can fill the air for you.</v>

2951
01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:01.950
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2952
01:28:01.950 --> 01:28:02.783
<v Speaker 5>Just a minute.</v>

2953
01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:08.280
<v Speaker 5>Alright.</v>

2954
01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:09.810
<v Speaker 5>So I'll just read off this thing.</v>

2955
01:28:09.811 --> 01:28:10.644
<v Speaker 5>I wrote,</v>

2956
01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:13.020
<v Speaker 5>history is said to be written by the victors,</v>

2957
01:28:13.290 --> 01:28:14.760
<v Speaker 5>but really the history is</v>

2958
01:28:16.370 --> 01:28:17.010
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

2959
01:28:17.010 --> 01:28:17.281
<v Speaker 5>Sorry,</v>

2960
01:28:17.281 --> 01:28:18.270
<v Speaker 5>I think I fucked this up.</v>

2961
01:28:18.870 --> 01:28:20.700
<v Speaker 5>History is said to be written by the victors,</v>

2962
01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:24.810
<v Speaker 5>but really history is nearly written that history is written.</v>

2963
01:28:25.950 --> 01:28:26.730
<v Speaker 5>That history,</v>

2964
01:28:26.730 --> 01:28:31.380
<v Speaker 5>which is written is where the sentence should end written history.</v>

2965
01:28:31.381 --> 01:28:33.750
<v Speaker 5>Can never represent exactly how events occurred.</v>

2966
01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:36.210
<v Speaker 5>It can never be purely objective.</v>

2967
01:28:36.590 --> 01:28:37.321
<v Speaker 5>It is instead.</v>

2968
01:28:37.321 --> 01:28:41.100
<v Speaker 5>Subjective history is in fact written by the writers.</v>

2969
01:28:41.550 --> 01:28:46.020
<v Speaker 5>It cannot be any other way and must be considered in perspective and thought</v>

2970
01:28:46.140 --> 01:28:47.310
<v Speaker 5>about within context.</v>

2971
01:28:47.370 --> 01:28:48.240
<v Speaker 5>It's contextual.</v>

2972
01:28:48.241 --> 01:28:53.241
<v Speaker 5>Standing media as we see it today is written in much the same manner that media</v>

2973
01:28:53.911 --> 01:28:56.880
<v Speaker 5>cannot construct objective reality through its storytelling.</v>

2974
01:28:57.490 --> 01:29:01.740
<v Speaker 5>It is only possible to construct a subjective reality in the written word and</v>

2975
01:29:01.741 --> 01:29:06.741
<v Speaker 5>doing so creates a narrative tail which at some points is accurate of reality,</v>

2976
01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:09.240
<v Speaker 5>but in others less so.</v>

2977
01:29:09.900 --> 01:29:10.740
<v Speaker 5>Why does this matter?</v>

2978
01:29:11.250 --> 01:29:14.490
<v Speaker 5>Because we were told that the narrative is it self our reality</v>

2979
01:29:15.990 --> 01:29:17.570
<v Speaker 5>that is however mostly untrue.</v>

2980
01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:22.200
<v Speaker 5>It is no more true than to say that one subjective experiences are the totality</v>

2981
01:29:22.260 --> 01:29:23.670
<v Speaker 5>of our collective experience.</v>

2982
01:29:24.270 --> 01:29:29.270
<v Speaker 5>This cannot be said to be true because each individual experience a</v>

2983
01:29:29.370 --> 01:29:32.040
<v Speaker 5>differentiates to some degree from the collective,</v>

2984
01:29:33.090 --> 01:29:35.550
<v Speaker 5>which isn't really an experience a more.</v>

2985
01:29:35.551 --> 01:29:38.760
<v Speaker 5>It is a collectivization and narrative retelling of a certain time.</v>

2986
01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:43.130
<v Speaker 5>You cannot have a collective objective experience because anything you attribute</v>

2987
01:29:43.140 --> 01:29:47.100
<v Speaker 5>to a collective neither accurately describes reality for any individual.</v>

2988
01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:51.420
<v Speaker 5>Nor could it possibly described objective reality for a group of individuals.</v>

2989
01:29:52.350 --> 01:29:55.890
<v Speaker 5>That is not to say that the narrative narrative has no place at that.</v>

2990
01:29:55.891 --> 01:29:58.080
<v Speaker 5>The narrative cannot describe that objective reality.</v>

2991
01:29:58.920 --> 01:29:59.610
<v Speaker 5>A narrowed,</v>

2992
01:29:59.610 --> 01:30:00.210
<v Speaker 5>however,</v>

2993
01:30:00.210 --> 01:30:03.870
<v Speaker 5>is important because it allows us to transfer information and knowledge into the</v>

2994
01:30:03.871 --> 01:30:05.130
<v Speaker 5>future and to have this.</v>

2995
01:30:07.540 --> 01:30:10.680
<v Speaker 5>It's whatever it gives it gives it one weakness,</v>

2996
01:30:10.710 --> 01:30:13.920
<v Speaker 5>which is the weakness we must all look out for when we investigate and learn</v>

2997
01:30:13.921 --> 01:30:14.754
<v Speaker 5>about our history.</v>

2998
01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:18.930
<v Speaker 5>Both the strength and the weaknesses of the written word lay in the writer.</v>

2999
01:30:19.860 --> 01:30:21.190
<v Speaker 5>The truth is that history,</v>

3000
01:30:21.191 --> 01:30:22.860
<v Speaker 5>it was never written by the victor.</v>

3001
01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:24.720
<v Speaker 5>It was merely accepted by the victor.</v>

3002
01:30:25.050 --> 01:30:26.850
<v Speaker 5>It was instead written by the scribe.</v>

3003
01:30:27.450 --> 01:30:30.900
<v Speaker 5>Even though you may being the scribe of the victor,</v>

3004
01:30:30.901 --> 01:30:32.430
<v Speaker 5>it was nevertheless written by him.</v>

3005
01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:37.380
<v Speaker 5>It is true that the victor ad been unaccepting of described work.</v>

3006
01:30:37.570 --> 01:30:37.960
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3007
01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:38.140
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

3008
01:30:38.140 --> 01:30:38.550
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3009
01:30:38.550 --> 01:30:42.450
<v Speaker 5>if he had been unaccepting of described where he could have altered the written</v>

3010
01:30:42.451 --> 01:30:43.284
<v Speaker 5>narrative,</v>

3011
01:30:43.850 --> 01:30:47.700
<v Speaker 5>but how could the victor possibly understand or know or foresee the future</v>

3012
01:30:47.730 --> 01:30:49.710
<v Speaker 5>interpretations of the narrative subscribed?</v>

3013
01:30:50.950 --> 01:30:54.480
<v Speaker 5>The truth is that the victor could not foresee how exactly future generations</v>

3014
01:30:54.481 --> 01:30:56.070
<v Speaker 5>would interpret the scribe history.</v>

3015
01:30:56.310 --> 01:30:57.150
<v Speaker 5>So it is possible.</v>

3016
01:30:57.151 --> 01:30:58.920
<v Speaker 5>We are the descendants of the history.</v>

3017
01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:01.530
<v Speaker 5>It'd be interpreting it differently than our ancestors.</v>

3018
01:31:02.610 --> 01:31:03.443
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

3019
01:31:03.570 --> 01:31:05.640
<v Speaker 5>Especially the spirit of the written work.</v>

3020
01:31:06.150 --> 01:31:09.750
<v Speaker 5>One might try and argue that the present narratives are more reliable than past</v>

3021
01:31:09.751 --> 01:31:10.584
<v Speaker 5>ones.</v>

3022
01:31:10.790 --> 01:31:14.090
<v Speaker 5>Not The reliability only reduces by a narrative age.</v>

3023
01:31:14.610 --> 01:31:16.830
<v Speaker 5>I consider that this isn't the case.</v>

3024
01:31:17.670 --> 01:31:18.510
<v Speaker 5>What can we infer?</v>

3025
01:31:18.530 --> 01:31:18.750
<v Speaker 5>Homework,</v>

3026
01:31:18.750 --> 01:31:19.770
<v Speaker 5>contemporary media</v>

3027
01:31:21.330 --> 01:31:23.160
<v Speaker 5>if they're in their narratives.</v>

3028
01:31:24.100 --> 01:31:24.270
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3029
01:31:24.270 --> 01:31:24.931
<v Speaker 5>That's all I wrote.</v>

3030
01:31:24.931 --> 01:31:26.410
<v Speaker 5>So a partial.</v>

3031
01:31:27.410 --> 01:31:27.810
<v Speaker 5>Are you,</v>

3032
01:31:27.810 --> 01:31:28.643
<v Speaker 5>are you back?</v>

3033
01:31:31.060 --> 01:31:31.893
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3034
01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:33.850
<v Speaker 5>it must be just turning the knob.</v>

3035
01:31:38.020 --> 01:31:39.820
<v Speaker 5>That was kind of kind of blabbering on there.</v>

3036
01:31:39.821 --> 01:31:42.070
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't quite finished what I was doing.</v>

3037
01:31:45.950 --> 01:31:46.161
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

3038
01:31:46.161 --> 01:31:48.020
<v Speaker 5>History is definitely rewritten for the uh,</v>

3039
01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:49.873
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3040
01:31:50.550 --> 01:31:52.400
<v Speaker 5>he was definitely written by.</v>

3041
01:31:53.930 --> 01:31:54.370
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3042
01:31:54.370 --> 01:31:55.203
<v Speaker 5>it depends.</v>

3043
01:31:55.370 --> 01:31:57.170
<v Speaker 5>It can be rewritten by the current victor</v>

3044
01:31:58.980 --> 01:32:00.090
<v Speaker 5>and that's certainly the case,</v>

3045
01:32:00.090 --> 01:32:00.923
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

3046
01:32:08.300 --> 01:32:08.451
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>header chromia.</v>

3048
01:32:09.340 --> 01:32:10.131
<v Speaker 3>That's what my,</v>

3049
01:32:10.131 --> 01:32:10.390
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3050
01:32:10.390 --> 01:32:13.850
<v Speaker 3>I just looking at the chat now as what my great grandfather had,</v>

3051
01:32:14.030 --> 01:32:14.840
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3052
01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:15.380
<v Speaker 3>he was actually,</v>

3053
01:32:15.380 --> 01:32:15.680
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

3054
01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:16.460
<v Speaker 3>he got sent off.</v>

3055
01:32:16.460 --> 01:32:21.460
<v Speaker 3>You get registered on Vancouver island to fight in the Canadian expeditionary</v>

3056
01:32:21.741 --> 01:32:22.281
<v Speaker 3>forces.</v>

3057
01:32:22.281 --> 01:32:23.150
<v Speaker 3>Which went to Siberia.</v>

3058
01:32:23.151 --> 01:32:25.970
<v Speaker 3>That helps stop the Russian revolution or the assist.</v>

3059
01:32:25.971 --> 01:32:26.810
<v Speaker 3>The white army.</v>

3060
01:32:27.740 --> 01:32:28.573
<v Speaker 3>It's the ribs.</v>

3061
01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:29.151
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3062
01:32:29.151 --> 01:32:31.460
<v Speaker 3>I guess I missed failed because they came back.</v>

3063
01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:34.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm in a rush and I have all his documents,</v>

3064
01:32:34.620 --> 01:32:36.140
<v Speaker 3>a pay stubs and stuff.</v>

3065
01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:38.510
<v Speaker 3>From that time I thought it was pretty interesting.</v>

3066
01:32:38.511 --> 01:32:41.990
<v Speaker 3>So that's the history we don't know about a lot in Canada.</v>

3067
01:32:42.590 --> 01:32:43.423
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

3068
01:32:46.340 --> 01:32:47.173
<v Speaker 3>it was cool to see.</v>

3069
01:32:48.530 --> 01:32:50.690
<v Speaker 3>But I found out he had three families.</v>

3070
01:32:51.140 --> 01:32:53.120
<v Speaker 3>First he that he came from Scotland.</v>

3071
01:32:53.121 --> 01:32:57.530
<v Speaker 3>He married a Mexican woman named Maria and they moved to the Seattle area.</v>

3072
01:32:57.600 --> 01:32:58.790
<v Speaker 3>And you had two children.</v>

3073
01:32:59.570 --> 01:32:59.751
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3074
01:32:59.751 --> 01:33:00.860
<v Speaker 3>they got divorced,</v>

3075
01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:02.180
<v Speaker 3>she got the children,</v>

3076
01:33:02.650 --> 01:33:03.740
<v Speaker 3>he moved away,</v>

3077
01:33:03.750 --> 01:33:05.480
<v Speaker 3>met my great grandmother and Alberta,</v>

3078
01:33:06.890 --> 01:33:07.251
<v Speaker 3>Alberta,</v>

3079
01:33:07.251 --> 01:33:07.820
<v Speaker 3>Saskatchewan.</v>

3080
01:33:07.820 --> 01:33:08.653
<v Speaker 3>Her name was Alberta.</v>

3081
01:33:09.290 --> 01:33:10.123
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

3082
01:33:10.310 --> 01:33:12.230
<v Speaker 3>then he had three more kids with them.</v>

3083
01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:13.570
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3084
01:33:13.570 --> 01:33:14.301
<v Speaker 3>but before that happened,</v>

3085
01:33:14.301 --> 01:33:14.900
<v Speaker 3>my great,</v>

3086
01:33:14.900 --> 01:33:16.700
<v Speaker 3>great grandfather who was his dad,</v>

3087
01:33:17.390 --> 01:33:18.223
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3088
01:33:18.470 --> 01:33:20.720
<v Speaker 3>one to know where the hell his grandkids were.</v>

3089
01:33:20.840 --> 01:33:24.440
<v Speaker 3>So he went to a Seattle and found them in an orphanage.</v>

3090
01:33:24.441 --> 01:33:25.310
<v Speaker 3>But the sun,</v>

3091
01:33:25.390 --> 01:33:26.223
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3092
01:33:26.230 --> 01:33:27.063
<v Speaker 3>there was two children,</v>

3093
01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:27.861
<v Speaker 3>son was younger.</v>

3094
01:33:27.861 --> 01:33:30.410
<v Speaker 3>He was adopted right away by another family,</v>

3095
01:33:30.620 --> 01:33:32.000
<v Speaker 3>so he couldn't find them.</v>

3096
01:33:32.370 --> 01:33:32.530
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3097
01:33:32.530 --> 01:33:37.530
<v Speaker 3>but he found the daughter who is older and he brought her back to a Saskatchewan</v>

3098
01:33:38.401 --> 01:33:41.540
<v Speaker 3>and basically just dropped them off with my great grandfather and said,</v>

3099
01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:44.050
<v Speaker 3>dropped her off my great grandfather and said like,</v>

3100
01:33:44.060 --> 01:33:45.350
<v Speaker 3>you're take your damn kid.</v>

3101
01:33:45.950 --> 01:33:46.783
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

3102
01:33:47.420 --> 01:33:50.510
<v Speaker 3>so that my grandfather ended up growing up with this,</v>

3103
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:50.900
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3104
01:33:50.900 --> 01:33:55.900
<v Speaker 3>his older half sister or then when he went off to war to stop the doll,</v>

3105
01:33:56.720 --> 01:33:59.340
<v Speaker 3>I guess during the depression slash world war two,</v>

3106
01:33:59.730 --> 01:33:59.960
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3107
01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:04.960
<v Speaker 3>money came back to you is she was gone and I had divorced her husband and uh,</v>

3108
01:34:06.200 --> 01:34:11.200
<v Speaker 3>I guess taken the four boys that she had had with him and he went to,</v>

3109
01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:15.310
<v Speaker 3>she went off to try to find her brother in Seattle,</v>

3110
01:34:15.311 --> 01:34:17.120
<v Speaker 3>will never did married some random dude,</v>

3111
01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:20.810
<v Speaker 3>another guy and end up dying in Arizona.</v>

3112
01:34:21.140 --> 01:34:21.973
<v Speaker 3>Two thousand five,</v>

3113
01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:23.451
<v Speaker 3>the four boys.</v>

3114
01:34:23.451 --> 01:34:26.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure exactly what happened to them there from the first marriage of my,</v>

3115
01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:27.710
<v Speaker 3>just my great aunt.</v>

3116
01:34:28.690 --> 01:34:29.120
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3117
01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:29.953
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

3118
01:34:30.290 --> 01:34:31.123
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3119
01:34:31.430 --> 01:34:35.450
<v Speaker 3>I think one of them ended up fostering a second cousin of mine that lives in my</v>

3120
01:34:35.451 --> 01:34:38.560
<v Speaker 3>town and I was able to find her through 23 and me and um,</v>

3121
01:34:39.190 --> 01:34:42.010
<v Speaker 3>I went for coffee with her and stuff and it's interesting.</v>

3122
01:34:42.050 --> 01:34:43.610
<v Speaker 3>She didn't know she was adopted though,</v>

3123
01:34:43.611 --> 01:34:44.444
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

3124
01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:45.300
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3125
01:34:45.300 --> 01:34:47.420
<v Speaker 3>if we kind of gave her a heads up about her family,</v>

3126
01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:51.113
<v Speaker 2>I'm back.</v>

3127
01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:52.631
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

3128
01:34:52.631 --> 01:34:53.464
<v Speaker 3>what's up?</v>

3129
01:34:56.170 --> 01:34:56.620
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3130
01:34:56.620 --> 01:34:57.030
<v Speaker 5>so I,</v>

3131
01:34:57.030 --> 01:34:57.450
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3132
01:34:57.450 --> 01:34:58.283
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

3133
01:34:58.930 --> 01:35:00.070
<v Speaker 5>I ran out of the thing I wrote,</v>

3134
01:35:00.090 --> 01:35:00.600
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>

3135
01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:01.433
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't,</v>

3136
01:35:01.460 --> 01:35:02.990
<v Speaker 5>I didn't realize I hadn't finished it,</v>

3137
01:35:02.991 --> 01:35:05.000
<v Speaker 5>so when I got to the end to just kind of trailed off,</v>

3138
01:35:07.330 --> 01:35:07.601
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

3139
01:35:07.601 --> 01:35:08.434
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3140
01:35:08.460 --> 01:35:10.850
<v Speaker 6>so exactly a what.</v>

3141
01:35:12.570 --> 01:35:16.320
<v Speaker 5>So how do you know that your dread third generation,</v>

3142
01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:17.430
<v Speaker 5>third generation?</v>

3143
01:35:17.431 --> 01:35:18.264
<v Speaker 5>Does it?</v>

3144
01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:20.760
<v Speaker 5>Do you have to consider all your grandparents or,</v>

3145
01:35:20.761 --> 01:35:21.594
<v Speaker 5>or is it just.</v>

3146
01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:23.640
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3147
01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:27.060
<v Speaker 5>traditionally you go by your father's father's father sort of thing.</v>

3148
01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:29.970
<v Speaker 5>You kind of go down the a paternal line.</v>

3149
01:35:30.330 --> 01:35:31.740
<v Speaker 5>So whatever your name is,</v>

3150
01:35:31.820 --> 01:35:32.020
<v Speaker 5>Becky,</v>

3151
01:35:32.020 --> 01:35:32.853
<v Speaker 5>whatever you.</v>

3152
01:35:32.860 --> 01:35:34.410
<v Speaker 5>It wouldn't have to be your father's line neighbor.</v>

3153
01:35:34.470 --> 01:35:35.303
<v Speaker 5>Like you could,</v>

3154
01:35:35.310 --> 01:35:36.510
<v Speaker 5>if you had your mother's last name,</v>

3155
01:35:36.511 --> 01:35:36.991
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

3156
01:35:36.991 --> 01:35:37.711
<v Speaker 5>you could go by that,</v>

3157
01:35:37.711 --> 01:35:39.780
<v Speaker 5>but it says generally by what your last name is,</v>

3158
01:35:40.270 --> 01:35:41.103
<v Speaker 5>because I mean otherwise,</v>

3159
01:35:41.310 --> 01:35:43.230
<v Speaker 5>otherwise you'd have 10,000 different origins,</v>

3160
01:35:43.231 --> 01:35:44.064
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3161
01:35:44.460 --> 01:35:44.850
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3162
01:35:44.850 --> 01:35:45.920
<v Speaker 5>But that was different.</v>

3163
01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:47.153
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3164
01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:48.720
<v Speaker 5>It depends on the tradition though.</v>

3165
01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:49.730
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

3166
01:35:49.730 --> 01:35:50.280
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3167
01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:50.790
<v Speaker 5>but my,</v>

3168
01:35:50.790 --> 01:35:53.940
<v Speaker 5>I know my family's tradition as a is a patriarchal.</v>

3169
01:35:53.941 --> 01:35:54.261
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>

3170
01:35:54.261 --> 01:35:55.081
<v Speaker 5>But you'd go by the,</v>

3171
01:35:55.081 --> 01:35:55.390
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3172
01:35:55.390 --> 01:35:56.850
<v Speaker 5>father's last name,</v>

3173
01:35:57.240 --> 01:35:59.370
<v Speaker 5>most western societies or anything?</v>

3174
01:36:00.660 --> 01:36:01.290
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3175
01:36:01.290 --> 01:36:01.720
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3176
01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:02.070
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3177
01:36:02.070 --> 01:36:02.251
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3178
01:36:02.251 --> 01:36:02.701
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

3179
01:36:02.701 --> 01:36:03.580
<v Speaker 5>Jewish society is,</v>

3180
01:36:03.581 --> 01:36:04.890
<v Speaker 5>I think they go by the mother.</v>

3181
01:36:05.220 --> 01:36:05.491
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3182
01:36:05.491 --> 01:36:06.324
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

3183
01:36:07.080 --> 01:36:08.220
<v Speaker 5>There's a good reason for that too,</v>

3184
01:36:08.250 --> 01:36:09.030
<v Speaker 5>because if,</v>

3185
01:36:09.030 --> 01:36:09.863
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3186
01:36:09.900 --> 01:36:10.200
<v Speaker 5>if you're,</v>

3187
01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:10.720
<v Speaker 5>if you,</v>

3188
01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:14.240
<v Speaker 5>the reason why the juice side is filled by the mothers because uh,</v>

3189
01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:15.873
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3190
01:36:15.930 --> 01:36:16.201
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3191
01:36:16.201 --> 01:36:18.540
<v Speaker 5>for sure that you're Jewish if your mother was Jewish,</v>

3192
01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:21.120
<v Speaker 5>but you could be fathered by some random dude.</v>

3193
01:36:21.121 --> 01:36:21.301
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3194
01:36:21.301 --> 01:36:25.080
<v Speaker 5>So if they don't think that they traditionally they don't see the father as the</v>

3195
01:36:25.081 --> 01:36:26.220
<v Speaker 5>reliable progenitor.</v>

3196
01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:27.593
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3197
01:36:28.470 --> 01:36:29.330
<v Speaker 5>So that's why you get these,</v>

3198
01:36:29.590 --> 01:36:30.510
<v Speaker 5>like these memes,</v>

3199
01:36:30.511 --> 01:36:34.470
<v Speaker 5>or like a Jewish mother is always want their sons to marry a Jewish woman so</v>

3200
01:36:34.471 --> 01:36:35.730
<v Speaker 5>they're can have Jewish grandkids.</v>

3201
01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:38.033
<v Speaker 5>That's what,</v>

3202
01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:39.180
<v Speaker 5>that's what that's all about,</v>

3203
01:36:39.180 --> 01:36:39.331
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3204
01:36:39.331 --> 01:36:39.750
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>

3205
01:36:39.750 --> 01:36:41.670
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of like we all make jokes about it.</v>

3206
01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:42.713
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3207
01:36:45.050 --> 01:36:46.910
<v Speaker 5>Why don't you marry Nice Jewish girl.</v>

3208
01:36:48.420 --> 01:36:49.800
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>

3209
01:36:50.300 --> 01:36:50.871
<v Speaker 5>It's interesting.</v>

3210
01:36:50.871 --> 01:36:52.550
<v Speaker 5>Or at least different traditions that people have.</v>

3211
01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:53.690
<v Speaker 5>Like the native Americans.</v>

3212
01:36:53.691 --> 01:36:55.100
<v Speaker 5>I think they have a different one as well.</v>

3213
01:36:57.230 --> 01:36:59.330
<v Speaker 5>They're more about like the grandparents parents.</v>

3214
01:37:01.380 --> 01:37:01.810
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

3215
01:37:01.810 --> 01:37:02.140
<v Speaker 5>My,</v>

3216
01:37:02.140 --> 01:37:03.760
<v Speaker 5>my great grandfather,</v>

3217
01:37:03.761 --> 01:37:04.730
<v Speaker 5>he would be from a.</v>

3218
01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:06.490
<v Speaker 5>you'd be from Italy,</v>

3219
01:37:06.910 --> 01:37:07.750
<v Speaker 5>Bari Italy.</v>

3220
01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:10.120
<v Speaker 5>Do you know which part?</v>

3221
01:37:10.390 --> 01:37:10.811
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3222
01:37:10.811 --> 01:37:13.500
<v Speaker 5>a Bari Aria.</v>

3223
01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:16.010
<v Speaker 5>Which is that the north or South or south.</v>

3224
01:37:16.130 --> 01:37:17.270
<v Speaker 5>And it's on the,</v>

3225
01:37:17.271 --> 01:37:18.104
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3226
01:37:18.990 --> 01:37:20.460
<v Speaker 6>east coast line.</v>

3227
01:37:21.860 --> 01:37:22.211
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3228
01:37:22.211 --> 01:37:23.050
<v Speaker 5>So the opposite.</v>

3229
01:37:23.051 --> 01:37:23.261
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3230
01:37:23.261 --> 01:37:25.630
<v Speaker 5>So my wife's family's from Calabria,</v>

3231
01:37:27.950 --> 01:37:28.970
<v Speaker 5>which is like or Calabria.</v>

3232
01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:30.920
<v Speaker 5>It's like the one that's like the toe of the boot.</v>

3233
01:37:32.330 --> 01:37:33.163
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3234
01:37:33.650 --> 01:37:34.190
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3235
01:37:34.190 --> 01:37:35.420
<v Speaker 5>I guess here's the heel,</v>

3236
01:37:35.510 --> 01:37:36.343
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3237
01:37:36.410 --> 01:37:37.243
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3238
01:37:37.710 --> 01:37:38.543
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

3239
01:37:39.530 --> 01:37:39.771
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3240
01:37:39.771 --> 01:37:42.350
<v Speaker 5>The east side of east,</v>

3241
01:37:42.430 --> 01:37:42.740
<v Speaker 5>south,</v>

3242
01:37:42.740 --> 01:37:43.620
<v Speaker 5>east side of it</v>

3243
01:37:43.670 --> 01:37:47.660
<v Speaker 6>for south east side of Italy.</v>

3244
01:37:47.661 --> 01:37:48.494
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3245
01:37:49.910 --> 01:37:50.743
<v Speaker 6>That's cool.</v>

3246
01:37:51.630 --> 01:37:52.970
<v Speaker 5>Do you know how long they had been there for?</v>

3247
01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:54.760
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

3248
01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:55.230
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3249
01:37:55.230 --> 01:37:57.480
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how long they had been in Bari.</v>

3250
01:37:58.590 --> 01:37:59.760
<v Speaker 5>I've wondered about that,</v>

3251
01:38:00.630 --> 01:38:02.190
<v Speaker 5>but that's irrelevant.</v>

3252
01:38:02.191 --> 01:38:02.660
<v Speaker 5>Hey Kid,</v>

3253
01:38:02.660 --> 01:38:06.180
<v Speaker 5>probably you could probably figure it out if you went to a church there,</v>

3254
01:38:06.760 --> 01:38:09.090
<v Speaker 5>contribute visit about the church that your family went to.</v>

3255
01:38:09.150 --> 01:38:11.730
<v Speaker 5>They probably have records if any warehouse then it would be there.</v>

3256
01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:12.793
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

3257
01:38:13.290 --> 01:38:14.123
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3258
01:38:14.290 --> 01:38:15.620
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

3259
01:38:15.780 --> 01:38:17.010
<v Speaker 5>if I go back to the Netherlands,</v>

3260
01:38:17.011 --> 01:38:18.070
<v Speaker 5>I can in Scotland,</v>

3261
01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:21.960
<v Speaker 5>I can get records for my family as far back as I said there's a written record</v>

3262
01:38:21.961 --> 01:38:23.310
<v Speaker 5>anyways unless there's a fire.</v>

3263
01:38:24.150 --> 01:38:24.750
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3264
01:38:24.750 --> 01:38:25.583
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>

3265
01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:27.900
<v Speaker 5>I just don't have the money to go to Scotland.</v>

3266
01:38:27.901 --> 01:38:28.930
<v Speaker 5>Just know.</v>

3267
01:38:29.690 --> 01:38:30.060
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3268
01:38:30.060 --> 01:38:30.721
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know that.</v>

3269
01:38:30.721 --> 01:38:32.100
<v Speaker 5>I'm glad you told me about that.</v>

3270
01:38:32.990 --> 01:38:34.320
<v Speaker 5>I don't have the money to do that,</v>

3271
01:38:34.321 --> 01:38:36.300
<v Speaker 5>but it's kind of Nice to know that.</v>

3272
01:38:37.900 --> 01:38:38.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3273
01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:39.033
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

3274
01:38:39.530 --> 01:38:43.590
<v Speaker 5>that's available or possibly available if it hasn't been destroyed or discard it</v>

3275
01:38:43.591 --> 01:38:47.540
<v Speaker 5>or it'd probably be there like if it's your grandparents that were born there</v>

3276
01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:50.510
<v Speaker 5>and if you have their full names or something,</v>

3277
01:38:50.511 --> 01:38:52.190
<v Speaker 5>you could probably any knew where they lived.</v>

3278
01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:54.740
<v Speaker 5>You could probably figure it out like within a day or two.</v>

3279
01:38:55.070 --> 01:38:55.670
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>

3280
01:38:55.670 --> 01:38:56.100
<v Speaker 5>it just,</v>

3281
01:38:56.100 --> 01:38:58.550
<v Speaker 5>it depends if they're a registered and all that stuff.</v>

3282
01:38:58.551 --> 01:38:59.600
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>

3283
01:38:59.601 --> 01:39:00.261
<v Speaker 5>that's crazy thing.</v>

3284
01:39:00.261 --> 01:39:01.260
<v Speaker 5>Like so much history.</v>

3285
01:39:01.261 --> 01:39:05.870
<v Speaker 5>It just wasn't written down like there's so much missing now,</v>

3286
01:39:05.970 --> 01:39:06.980
<v Speaker 5>like nowadays,</v>

3287
01:39:07.030 --> 01:39:10.970
<v Speaker 5>like you're going to have pictures of yourself when I at every stage of your</v>

3288
01:39:10.971 --> 01:39:12.620
<v Speaker 5>life and your great,</v>

3289
01:39:12.621 --> 01:39:12.951
<v Speaker 5>great,</v>

3290
01:39:12.951 --> 01:39:14.290
<v Speaker 5>great grandkids might be able to like,</v>

3291
01:39:14.291 --> 01:39:15.124
<v Speaker 5>look at it.</v>

3292
01:39:15.350 --> 01:39:16.183
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3293
01:39:17.110 --> 01:39:18.320
<v Speaker 5>The way records are kept.</v>

3294
01:39:19.030 --> 01:39:19.863
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

3295
01:39:20.510 --> 01:39:23.930
<v Speaker 5>Assuming the survey result don't get wiped</v>

3296
01:39:27.540 --> 01:39:29.750
<v Speaker 5>barrier than underground under a sheet a lead or something.</v>

3297
01:39:32.190 --> 01:39:33.023
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3298
01:39:35.010 --> 01:39:36.620
<v Speaker 5>I forgot what I was going to say.</v>

3299
01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:42.953
<v Speaker 2>Can't remember.</v>

3300
01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:48.690
<v Speaker 5>We got to check the chat.</v>

3301

01:40:37.870 --> 01:40:40.530
<v Speaker 5>on the meantime I'll try to find something that I wrote.</v>

3324
01:40:41.090 --> 01:40:41.923
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3325
01:40:43.900 --> 01:40:44.820
<v Speaker 5>I wrote this a</v>

3326
01:40:46.420 --> 01:40:46.720
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

3327
01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:48.640
<v Speaker 5>I guess I could maybe pull something from it.</v>

3328
01:40:50.020 --> 01:40:50.853
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3329
01:40:56.690 --> 01:40:56.901
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

3330
01:40:56.901 --> 01:40:57.651
<v Speaker 5>So I read this thing.</v>

3331
01:40:57.651 --> 01:41:00.170
<v Speaker 5>I could give you the first paragraph or whatever and see what you think</v>

3332
01:41:01.890 --> 01:41:03.000
<v Speaker 5>we did discuss it or whatever.</v>

3333
01:41:03.210 --> 01:41:03.720
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3334
01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:03.871
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3335
01:41:03.871 --> 01:41:04.704
<v Speaker 5>go ahead.</v>

3336
01:41:04.770 --> 01:41:05.550
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3337
01:41:05.550 --> 01:41:06.383
<v Speaker 5>Alright.</v>

3338
01:41:06.660 --> 01:41:09.990
<v Speaker 5>So I'll just read the paragraph and then I'll say it's done or whatever.</v>

3339
01:41:10.500 --> 01:41:10.870
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3340
01:41:10.870 --> 01:41:14.730
<v Speaker 5>I often consider certain prescribed ideas which counter orthodoxy.</v>

3341
01:41:15.570 --> 01:41:17.190
<v Speaker 5>I'm not certain why I do so,</v>

3342
01:41:17.191 --> 01:41:21.540
<v Speaker 5>but I think it's because they used to fall into such orthodox will thinking to</v>

3343
01:41:21.541 --> 01:41:22.620
<v Speaker 5>some degree anyways,</v>

3344
01:41:23.550 --> 01:41:27.070
<v Speaker 5>the questioning alleged authority figures seems to be a part of my being is</v>

3345
01:41:27.090 --> 01:41:27.923
<v Speaker 5>fiber.</v>

3346
01:41:28.470 --> 01:41:29.850
<v Speaker 5>Perhaps I speak truth,</v>

3347
01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:32.070
<v Speaker 5>but that would seem to sell for grandizing.</v>

3348
01:41:32.250 --> 01:41:36.210
<v Speaker 5>So best to avoid believing that holy as it risks falling into similar modes of</v>

3349
01:41:36.211 --> 01:41:41.211
<v Speaker 5>thinking in regards to truly knowing that is to say overconfidence towards one's</v>

3350
01:41:41.821 --> 01:41:46.590
<v Speaker 5>limited knowledge for as a rule once knowledge is by definition very limited.</v>

3351
01:41:47.500 --> 01:41:49.200
<v Speaker 5>That was the first paragraph anyways.</v>

3352
01:41:49.980 --> 01:41:50.813
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3353
01:41:50.910 --> 01:41:51.231
<v Speaker 5>so what,</v>

3354
01:41:51.231 --> 01:41:52.620
<v Speaker 5>what I was trying to get up there was</v>

3355
01:41:53.190 --> 01:41:54.023
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

3356
01:41:54.830 --> 01:41:59.240
<v Speaker 5>I come across people that have these sort of stone ideas and</v>

3357
01:42:00.830 --> 01:42:03.530
<v Speaker 5>Orthodox Orthodox ideas and they don't,</v>

3358
01:42:03.590 --> 01:42:04.423
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3359
01:42:04.890 --> 01:42:06.140
<v Speaker 5>they're kinda like in movable.</v>

3360
01:42:06.830 --> 01:42:08.330
<v Speaker 5>And I find that.</v>

3361
01:42:08.620 --> 01:42:09.230
<v Speaker 5>What was,</v>

3362
01:42:09.230 --> 01:42:10.730
<v Speaker 5>I wrote this because I started thinking,</v>

3363
01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:11.510
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3364
01:42:11.510 --> 01:42:12.290
<v Speaker 5>why,</v>

3365
01:42:12.290 --> 01:42:17.240
<v Speaker 5>why are they these kinds of people that don't want to learn new things or why</v>

3366
01:42:17.241 --> 01:42:20.870
<v Speaker 5>don't they want to consider even just entertain the possibility of a different</v>

3367
01:42:20.871 --> 01:42:21.704
<v Speaker 5>idea?</v>

3368
01:42:22.190 --> 01:42:23.510
<v Speaker 5>So I started writing about that.</v>

3369
01:42:24.010 --> 01:42:25.580
<v Speaker 5>Maybe have you come across this,</v>

3370
01:42:26.570 --> 01:42:27.403
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3371
01:42:28.350 --> 01:42:28.690
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3372
01:42:28.690 --> 01:42:29.470
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3373
01:42:29.470 --> 01:42:29.780
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3374
01:42:29.780 --> 01:42:31.100
<v Speaker 5>somewhat with the whole</v>

3375
01:42:32.660 --> 01:42:33.060
<v Speaker 5>dose,</v>

3376
01:42:33.060 --> 01:42:33.891
<v Speaker 5>the Truth Candle.</v>

3377
01:42:33.891 --> 01:42:34.161
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3378
01:42:34.161 --> 01:42:35.990
<v Speaker 5>I thought the name when I picked it up,</v>

3379
01:42:36.350 --> 01:42:37.183
<v Speaker 5>it really didn't.</v>

3380
01:42:37.910 --> 01:42:39.350
<v Speaker 5>It really wasn't like,</v>

3381
01:42:39.410 --> 01:42:39.621
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3382
01:42:39.621 --> 01:42:41.050
<v Speaker 5>it's not really my dosage route.</v>

3383
01:42:41.130 --> 01:42:42.710
<v Speaker 5>The dose of truth is Jordan Peterson,</v>

3384
01:42:42.711 --> 01:42:43.251
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

3385
01:42:43.251 --> 01:42:43.611
<v Speaker 5>It was,</v>

3386
01:42:43.611 --> 01:42:44.300
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3387
01:42:44.300 --> 01:42:44.700
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

3388
01:42:44.700 --> 01:42:45.533
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3389
01:42:45.730 --> 01:42:46.563
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3390
01:42:49.110 --> 01:42:52.050
<v Speaker 5>like he was the one who is shedding new perspectives and then,</v>

3391
01:42:52.850 --> 01:42:53.191
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3392
01:42:53.191 --> 01:42:54.030
<v Speaker 5>then I got into,</v>

3393
01:42:54.031 --> 01:42:54.600
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3394
01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:55.980
<v Speaker 5>with titling videos,</v>

3395
01:42:57.140 --> 01:42:57.973
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

3396
01:42:58.430 --> 01:43:02.330
<v Speaker 5>Peterson would meet something and then I would take some interpretation and then</v>

3397
01:43:02.331 --> 01:43:05.450
<v Speaker 5>unfortunately not provide any commentary to be able to explain what I meant.</v>

3398
01:43:06.160 --> 01:43:06.440
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3399
01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:06.980
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

3400
01:43:06.980 --> 01:43:07.221
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3401
01:43:07.221 --> 01:43:08.150
<v Speaker 5>people be like,</v>

3402
01:43:08.180 --> 01:43:08.361
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3403
01:43:08.361 --> 01:43:09.350
<v Speaker 5>this is not that,</v>

3404
01:43:09.351 --> 01:43:10.640
<v Speaker 5>this is what this means.</v>

3405
01:43:11.420 --> 01:43:11.991
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

3406
01:43:11.991 --> 01:43:12.824
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3407
01:43:13.370 --> 01:43:14.840
<v Speaker 5>but I mean in everyday life,</v>

3408
01:43:15.690 --> 01:43:16.523
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3409
01:43:19.540 --> 01:43:19.751
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3410
01:43:19.751 --> 01:43:19.961
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3411
01:43:19.961 --> 01:43:20.794
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3412
01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:26.760
<v Speaker 5>I certainly try and stay open about everything,</v>

3413
01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:27.361
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3414
01:43:27.361 --> 01:43:31.120
<v Speaker 5>I just assume most of the time that I don't know.</v>

3415
01:43:33.730 --> 01:43:34.563
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

3416
01:43:36.830 --> 01:43:38.960
<v Speaker 5>I just assume most of the time that I don't know what the hell.</v>

3417
01:43:41.980 --> 01:43:42.813
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3418
01:43:43.340 --> 01:43:44.260
<v Speaker 5>Well if you're open to learning,</v>

3419
01:43:44.270 --> 01:43:48.560
<v Speaker 5>that's always the best way that I approach things because otherwise you just</v>

3420
01:43:48.561 --> 01:43:49.520
<v Speaker 5>become too uh,</v>

3421
01:43:50.190 --> 01:43:51.023
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3422
01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:52.340
<v Speaker 5>you liked the humility,</v>

3423
01:43:52.341 --> 01:43:52.820
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3424
01:43:52.820 --> 01:43:53.653
<v Speaker 5>To learn?</v>

3425
01:43:55.530 --> 01:43:56.363
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3426
01:43:59.080 --> 01:43:59.913
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3427
01:44:00.250 --> 01:44:01.083
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3428
01:44:06.100 --> 01:44:06.341
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3429
01:44:06.341 --> 01:44:07.240
<v Speaker 5>I come across</v>

3430
01:44:07.550 --> 01:44:08.383
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

3431
01:44:13.340 --> 01:44:13.670
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>

3432
01:44:13.670 --> 01:44:15.920
<v Speaker 5>Who Do you have for who definitely like dead set in their beliefs.</v>

3433
01:44:15.970 --> 01:44:16.610
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3434
01:44:16.610 --> 01:44:21.560
<v Speaker 5>but you try and ask them why and they'll try and argue from</v>

3435
01:44:23.470 --> 01:44:25.930
<v Speaker 5>like a moral standpoint rather than any type of,</v>

3436
01:44:26.520 --> 01:44:26.910
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3437
01:44:26.910 --> 01:44:27.743
<v Speaker 5>rational</v>

3438
01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:30.273
<v Speaker 5>standpoint.</v>

3439
01:44:32.940 --> 01:44:33.773
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3440
01:44:37.220 --> 01:44:37.440
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3441
01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:39.320
<v Speaker 5>want me to go into a second paragraph?</v>

3442
01:44:39.380 --> 01:44:39.860
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3443
01:44:39.860 --> 01:44:40.041
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3444
01:44:40.041 --> 01:44:40.874
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>

3445
01:44:41.100 --> 01:44:42.020
<v Speaker 5>All no problem.</v>

3446
01:44:42.021 --> 01:44:42.660
<v Speaker 5>I got like,</v>

3447
01:44:42.660 --> 01:44:43.101
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

3448
01:44:43.101 --> 01:44:44.600
<v Speaker 5>I think there's five paragraphs.</v>

3449
01:44:44.601 --> 01:44:45.434
<v Speaker 5>I don't read them all and this,</v>

3450
01:44:45.790 --> 01:44:49.970
<v Speaker 5>I will work through respond anyways if we even do they get boring world to stop</v>

3451
01:44:50.180 --> 01:44:51.013
<v Speaker 5>because I don't want to.</v>

3452
01:44:51.020 --> 01:44:52.000
<v Speaker 5>Definitely not boring.</v>

3453
01:44:52.010 --> 01:44:52.730
<v Speaker 5>If anybody's boring,</v>

3454
01:44:52.730 --> 01:44:53.563
<v Speaker 5>it's okay.</v>

3455
01:44:55.730 --> 01:44:59.720
<v Speaker 5>So the difference then between arrogance and wisdom and and also when I'm</v>

3456
01:44:59.721 --> 01:45:00.231
<v Speaker 5>writing this,</v>

3457
01:45:00.231 --> 01:45:00.530
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

3458
01:45:00.530 --> 01:45:01.730
<v Speaker 5>just like thinking out loud,</v>

3459
01:45:01.850 --> 01:45:06.850
<v Speaker 5>like reading without like really I'm kind of rewriting this without really was</v>

3460
01:45:07.191 --> 01:45:07.971
<v Speaker 5>kind of rough draft.</v>

3461
01:45:07.971 --> 01:45:08.804
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3462
01:45:08.850 --> 01:45:11.120
<v Speaker 5>I just want to say that before I start going off,</v>

3463
01:45:11.810 --> 01:45:13.530
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry I said that I.</v>

3464
01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:18.020
<v Speaker 5>I go on the difference then between arrogance and the wisdom is both in at least</v>

3465
01:45:18.030 --> 01:45:21.520
<v Speaker 5>some part wisdom that is to say experience and landscape passage.</v>

3466
01:45:21.521 --> 01:45:22.730
<v Speaker 5>You have to think about that.</v>

3467
01:45:22.730 --> 01:45:25.640
<v Speaker 5>I mean to filtered biases in a truthful and honest manner.</v>

3468
01:45:26.660 --> 01:45:26.781
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

3469
01:45:26.781 --> 01:45:30.110
<v Speaker 5>removing biases or biases may not be possible,</v>

3470
01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:34.310
<v Speaker 5>but it is possible to be thoughtful about them and perhaps experiment with one's</v>

3471
01:45:34.311 --> 01:45:36.860
<v Speaker 5>capacity to hold a thought in one's mind,</v>

3472
01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:40.460
<v Speaker 5>in which one does not necessarily hold as part of their personal philosophy of</v>

3473
01:45:40.461 --> 01:45:41.294
<v Speaker 5>life.</v>

3474
01:45:41.690 --> 01:45:43.690
<v Speaker 5>Perhaps this capacity to emphasize,</v>

3475
01:45:44.900 --> 01:45:48.560
<v Speaker 5>empathize with others is what allows one to really understand other ways of</v>

3476
01:45:48.561 --> 01:45:53.330
<v Speaker 5>thinking and in order to truly see them as valid or invalid based on their</v>

3477
01:45:53.331 --> 01:45:55.280
<v Speaker 5>genuine merits rather than rhetoric.</v>

3478
01:45:55.700 --> 01:45:57.360
<v Speaker 5>I currently have you rhetoric as a co,</v>

3479
01:45:57.470 --> 01:46:02.470
<v Speaker 5>as comforting lies rather than what purposes are what their purpose does are</v>

3480
01:46:02.721 --> 01:46:03.554
<v Speaker 5>supposed to be.</v>

3481
01:46:03.770 --> 01:46:06.290
<v Speaker 5>That is to convince people using information,</v>

3482
01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:09.830
<v Speaker 5>whether the information is valid or invalid doesn't seem to matter.</v>

3483
01:46:10.340 --> 01:46:12.170
<v Speaker 5>Some believe in very wrongly,</v>

3484
01:46:12.171 --> 01:46:13.004
<v Speaker 5>in my opinion,</v>

3485
01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:17.720
<v Speaker 5>that data recorded can be pure rational evidence of a known problem and thus</v>

3486
01:46:17.820 --> 01:46:19.880
<v Speaker 5>guide us toward the solution to solve problems.</v>

3487
01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:22.400
<v Speaker 5>That's my second paragraph there.</v>

3488
01:46:23.150 --> 01:46:24.710
<v Speaker 5>Can you repeat the last sentence?</v>

3489
01:46:25.580 --> 01:46:26.413
<v Speaker 5>Oh sure.</v>

3490
01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:27.740
<v Speaker 5>But you're back there.</v>

3491
01:46:27.770 --> 01:46:30.440
<v Speaker 5>Some belief and very wrongly in my opinion,</v>

3492
01:46:30.770 --> 01:46:35.770
<v Speaker 5>that data recorded and be pure rational evidence of a known problem and thus</v>

3493
01:46:36.381 --> 01:46:39.020
<v Speaker 5>guide us towards a solution to those problems.</v>

3494
01:46:41.510 --> 01:46:42.290
<v Speaker 5>So what do you.</v>

3495
01:46:42.290 --> 01:46:43.850
<v Speaker 5>What exactly do you mean by that?</v>

3496
01:46:44.060 --> 01:46:45.050
<v Speaker 5>That data recorded?</v>

3497
01:46:46.340 --> 01:46:46.690
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3498
01:46:46.690 --> 01:46:51.660
<v Speaker 5>I think that some people see like they pick like a say two plus two equals four,</v>

3499
01:46:51.690 --> 01:46:54.510
<v Speaker 5>therefore that means this,</v>

3500
01:46:54.540 --> 01:46:55.110
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3501
01:46:55.110 --> 01:46:58.050
<v Speaker 5>And they think they're being objective.</v>

3502
01:46:58.140 --> 01:46:58.973
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

3503
01:47:00.450 --> 01:47:00.910
<v Speaker 5>that's hard.</v>

3504
01:47:00.910 --> 01:47:01.743
<v Speaker 5>The</v>

3505
01:47:02.670 --> 01:47:04.630
<v Speaker 5>they think they believe that they're there.</v>

3506
01:47:05.140 --> 01:47:09.780
<v Speaker 5>They're subjective interpretation of data is objective because they.</v>

3507
01:47:09.830 --> 01:47:11.320
<v Speaker 5>Because the data's objective itself,</v>

3508
01:47:11.330 --> 01:47:12.260
<v Speaker 5>like Duplos do,</v>

3509
01:47:12.270 --> 01:47:13.080
<v Speaker 5>does he go for it?</v>

3510
01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:15.930
<v Speaker 5>But that doesn't mean that when you apply it to real world,</v>

3511
01:47:16.420 --> 01:47:17.070
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3512
01:47:17.070 --> 01:47:17.940
<v Speaker 5>that means that like,</v>

3513
01:47:17.941 --> 01:47:21.310
<v Speaker 5>I know a goat's milk is better than cow's milk or something like that.</v>

3514
01:47:21.420 --> 01:47:23.610
<v Speaker 5>This is some random example,</v>

3515
01:47:24.450 --> 01:47:29.450
<v Speaker 5>but they might see that the actual raw data as the proof of bias of their bias.</v>

3516
01:47:31.091 --> 01:47:31.924
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3517
01:47:33.420 --> 01:47:33.871
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3518
01:47:33.871 --> 01:47:34.321
<v Speaker 5>I'm here.</v>

3519
01:47:34.321 --> 01:47:35.400
<v Speaker 5>I've probably done it.</v>

3520
01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:35.760
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3521
01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:40.760
<v Speaker 5>I'm not that I'm not intelligent and certainly not edgy and educated very well.</v>

3522
01:47:41.080 --> 01:47:43.140
<v Speaker 5>So I think,</v>

3523
01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:44.850
<v Speaker 5>I think everybody does even like,</v>

3524
01:47:45.090 --> 01:47:45.810
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

3525
01:47:45.810 --> 01:47:47.060
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

3526
01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:48.540
<v Speaker 5>the most elegant of this.</v>

3527
01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:49.981
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3528
01:47:49.981 --> 01:47:50.311
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

3529
01:47:50.311 --> 01:47:53.130
<v Speaker 5>I don't know that biases by Caesar,</v>

3530
01:47:54.870 --> 01:47:56.630
<v Speaker 6>you're a</v>

3531
01:47:58.410 --> 01:47:59.250
<v Speaker 6>can be eradicated.</v>

3532
01:47:59.251 --> 01:48:00.760
<v Speaker 6>IREC edible here</v>

3533
01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:04.353
<v Speaker 5>can be.</v>

3534
01:48:05.980 --> 01:48:09.670
<v Speaker 5>I can renew it reconcilable now that irreconcilable</v>

3535
01:48:10.120 --> 01:48:11.950
<v Speaker 6>you do eradicate,</v>

3536
01:48:12.730 --> 01:48:13.563
<v Speaker 6>eradicate.</v>

3537
01:48:13.890 --> 01:48:16.010
<v Speaker 5>Is that your radical?</v>

3538
01:48:16.340 --> 01:48:16.611
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3539
01:48:16.611 --> 01:48:20.360
<v Speaker 5>You're asking eradicable that sounds good to me is a tough word.</v>

3540
01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:21.080
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3541
01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:25.970
<v Speaker 5>Well it shouldn't be unless it was a fucked up language</v>

3542
01:48:29.110 --> 01:48:30.470
<v Speaker 5>is I think era era.</v>

3543
01:48:30.500 --> 01:48:31.110
<v Speaker 5>And that's like,</v>

3544
01:48:31.110 --> 01:48:31.430
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3545
01:48:31.430 --> 01:48:31.710
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3546
01:48:31.710 --> 01:48:32.660
<v Speaker 5>the uh,</v>

3547
01:48:32.810 --> 01:48:36.380
<v Speaker 5>the first part of that word is more of a little Latin or Greek origin in the</v>

3548
01:48:36.410 --> 01:48:38.030
<v Speaker 5>second half of that word is not,</v>

3549
01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:39.850
<v Speaker 5>it's like a dramatic origins.</v>

3550
01:48:39.851 --> 01:48:40.684
<v Speaker 5>So it's like,</v>

3551
01:48:41.080 --> 01:48:43.970
<v Speaker 5>it's almost a Portmanteau oh,</v>

3552
01:48:43.971 --> 01:48:45.410
<v Speaker 5>that's another thing I'm really interested in too.</v>

3553
01:48:45.411 --> 01:48:47.810
<v Speaker 5>I'm interested in etymology and like different languages.</v>

3554
01:48:48.710 --> 01:48:49.400
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3555
01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:51.710
<v Speaker 5>The origin of words.</v>

3556
01:48:52.250 --> 01:48:53.083
<v Speaker 5>Etymology.</v>

3557
01:48:54.630 --> 01:48:54.901
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3558
01:48:54.901 --> 01:48:56.610
<v Speaker 5>Entomology is like the origin of words and how,</v>

3559
01:48:56.690 --> 01:48:58.080
<v Speaker 5>how they're formed or the,</v>

3560
01:48:58.130 --> 01:48:59.750
<v Speaker 5>the how are they came to,</v>

3561
01:48:59.940 --> 01:49:01.120
<v Speaker 5>they came to be a,</v>

3562
01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:04.680
<v Speaker 5>their origins and like other languages and such like that.</v>

3563
01:49:05.100 --> 01:49:05.933
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3564
01:49:06.170 --> 01:49:07.003
<v Speaker 5>Like a,</v>

3565
01:49:07.140 --> 01:49:09.990
<v Speaker 5>like English is only like 10 percent norse for example,</v>

3566
01:49:09.991 --> 01:49:11.550
<v Speaker 5>like based off old norse languages,</v>

3567
01:49:11.670 --> 01:49:14.790
<v Speaker 5>but like the words that we most commonly use are all norse.</v>

3568
01:49:15.570 --> 01:49:18.840
<v Speaker 5>So like what are words or pronouns?</v>

3569
01:49:18.841 --> 01:49:19.674
<v Speaker 5>Most of the are,</v>

3570
01:49:20.210 --> 01:49:21.043
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3571
01:49:21.740 --> 01:49:22.573
<v Speaker 6>which I thought were</v>

3572
01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:26.230
<v Speaker 5>they say 50,000 of our birds are French in origin.</v>

3573
01:49:26.231 --> 01:49:30.380
<v Speaker 5>But like that's just kind of a stupid thing to say because I'm,</v>

3574
01:49:31.210 --> 01:49:35.260
<v Speaker 5>a lot of the endings are the same like reception is of French origin work,</v>

3575
01:49:35.270 --> 01:49:35.930
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3576
01:49:35.930 --> 01:49:38.500
<v Speaker 5>So it's perception when a exception,</v>

3577
01:49:38.501 --> 01:49:39.700
<v Speaker 5>they're all French origin.</v>

3578
01:49:40.090 --> 01:49:40.923
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

3579
01:49:41.390 --> 01:49:41.890
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3580
01:49:41.890 --> 01:49:44.260
<v Speaker 5>they're not words that we use everyday or not everyday,</v>

3581
01:49:44.261 --> 01:49:45.370
<v Speaker 5>but in every sentence,</v>

3582
01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:45.881
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3583
01:49:45.881 --> 01:49:49.720
<v Speaker 5>although words are used in every or from like the Nordic languages in Germanic</v>

3584
01:49:49.721 --> 01:49:50.554
<v Speaker 5>languages,</v>

3585
01:49:52.900 --> 01:49:53.530
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3586
01:49:53.530 --> 01:49:54.780
<v Speaker 5>despite the fact that we're,</v>

3587
01:49:54.810 --> 01:49:56.710
<v Speaker 5>we're still largely influenced by the French,</v>

3588
01:49:57.040 --> 01:49:59.470
<v Speaker 5>the normans invading England back in like 10,</v>

3589
01:49:59.471 --> 01:50:00.304
<v Speaker 5>66.</v>

3590
01:50:02.890 --> 01:50:03.723
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3591
01:50:05.110 --> 01:50:06.730
<v Speaker 4>Lacking when it comes to history.</v>

3592
01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:08.920
<v Speaker 4>I know one thing is,</v>

3593
01:50:08.921 --> 01:50:09.754
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3594
01:50:10.120 --> 01:50:12.790
<v Speaker 4>when I took German in high school all four years,</v>

3595
01:50:13.490 --> 01:50:14.323
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

3596
01:50:15.010 --> 01:50:15.843
<v Speaker 8>I remember</v>

3597
01:50:16.660 --> 01:50:17.710
<v Speaker 4>my first year,</v>

3598
01:50:18.790 --> 01:50:22.720
<v Speaker 4>probably within the first couple of weeks I thought to myself like,</v>

3599
01:50:22.721 --> 01:50:23.021
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

3600
01:50:23.021 --> 01:50:23.854
<v Speaker 4>you didn't,</v>

3601
01:50:24.700 --> 01:50:27.880
<v Speaker 4>you didn't pick up anything as far as like,</v>

3602
01:50:28.250 --> 01:50:29.083
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3603
01:50:29.470 --> 01:50:33.850
<v Speaker 4>you didn't pick up much as far as grammar goes because I basically relearned</v>

3604
01:50:35.830 --> 01:50:40.830
<v Speaker 4>grammar in high school through a foreign language.</v>

3605
01:50:41.860 --> 01:50:42.693
<v Speaker 4>Like I.</v>

3606
01:50:42.700 --> 01:50:43.330
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3607
01:50:43.330 --> 01:50:44.880
<v Speaker 5>And it was weird.</v>

3608
01:50:44.910 --> 01:50:45.160
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3609
01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:45.993
<v Speaker 5>it was like,</v>

3610
01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:46.181
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

3611
01:50:46.181 --> 01:50:49.870
<v Speaker 5>I'm so dumb and I didn't pay attention or for whatever the reason.</v>

3612
01:50:50.290 --> 01:50:51.160
<v Speaker 5>But no,</v>

3613
01:50:51.570 --> 01:50:53.230
<v Speaker 5>it's actually like the philosophy that they,</v>

3614
01:50:53.260 --> 01:50:54.190
<v Speaker 5>how they teach English.</v>

3615
01:50:54.250 --> 01:50:54.980
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

3616
01:50:54.980 --> 01:50:55.720
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3617
01:50:55.720 --> 01:50:56.290
<v Speaker 5>what your,</v>

3618
01:50:56.290 --> 01:50:57.123
<v Speaker 5>what your rebar?</v>

3619
01:50:58.150 --> 01:50:58.983
<v Speaker 5>80 seven.</v>

3620
01:50:59.820 --> 01:51:00.341
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] 88.</v>

3621
01:51:00.341 --> 01:51:01.340
<v Speaker 5>So we're pretty much,</v>

3622
01:51:01.360 --> 01:51:02.193
<v Speaker 5>we're in the same era.</v>

3623
01:51:02.380 --> 01:51:02.741
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

3624
01:51:02.741 --> 01:51:03.400
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3625
01:51:03.400 --> 01:51:07.840
<v Speaker 5>but they did back in the nineties or maybe it's the late eighties,</v>

3626
01:51:08.110 --> 01:51:09.190
<v Speaker 5>it started teaching English.</v>

3627
01:51:09.220 --> 01:51:10.060
<v Speaker 5>They used to teach English,</v>

3628
01:51:10.630 --> 01:51:11.590
<v Speaker 5>German and French now,</v>

3629
01:51:12.010 --> 01:51:15.820
<v Speaker 5>and they decide to say English has two artistic of a language.</v>

3630
01:51:15.821 --> 01:51:18.190
<v Speaker 5>So they don't want you to learn inorganically.</v>

3631
01:51:18.220 --> 01:51:19.840
<v Speaker 5>They want you to learn it like naturally.</v>

3632
01:51:20.200 --> 01:51:21.430
<v Speaker 5>So they took away all the,</v>

3633
01:51:21.710 --> 01:51:22.543
<v Speaker 5>all the pointless,</v>

3634
01:51:23.410 --> 01:51:23.831
<v Speaker 5>pointless,</v>

3635
01:51:23.831 --> 01:51:27.130
<v Speaker 5>but all the structural grammar stuff like you learned in weight when you're</v>

3636
01:51:27.220 --> 01:51:30.610
<v Speaker 5>learning Spanish or French or German because we learned French</v>

3637
01:51:32.260 --> 01:51:33.093
<v Speaker 5>and Spanish.</v>

3638
01:51:33.320 --> 01:51:34.030
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3639
01:51:34.030 --> 01:51:34.331
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

3640
01:51:34.331 --> 01:51:35.164
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3641
01:51:36.160 --> 01:51:36.461
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3642
01:51:36.461 --> 01:51:40.000
<v Speaker 5>I had to learn all that stuff again in French and French is like at way</v>

3643
01:51:40.001 --> 01:51:41.200
<v Speaker 5>different language than German.</v>

3644
01:51:41.350 --> 01:51:42.430
<v Speaker 5>Like the way they structure it,</v>

3645
01:51:43.180 --> 01:51:45.940
<v Speaker 5>they don't use case cases and such a big deal.</v>

3646
01:51:46.540 --> 01:51:47.350
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3647
01:51:47.350 --> 01:51:48.970
<v Speaker 5>so when I tried to learn an Icelandic,</v>

3648
01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:50.620
<v Speaker 5>they have case just like in German,</v>

3649
01:51:50.621 --> 01:51:51.454
<v Speaker 5>then it's like,</v>

3650
01:51:51.670 --> 01:51:53.890
<v Speaker 5>it's like it's just as complicated as the German one,</v>

3651
01:51:54.370 --> 01:51:55.121
<v Speaker 5>but we never,</v>

3652
01:51:55.121 --> 01:51:56.280
<v Speaker 5>we never think about that in English.</v>

3653
01:51:56.290 --> 01:51:56.650
<v Speaker 5>We just,</v>

3654
01:51:56.650 --> 01:51:57.483
<v Speaker 5>we just do it,</v>

3655
01:51:57.520 --> 01:51:58.050
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3656
01:51:58.050 --> 01:51:58.883
<v Speaker 5>like you don't think,</v>

3657
01:51:59.230 --> 01:52:01.450
<v Speaker 5>you don't think about pushing the gas pedal really when you're driving,</v>

3658
01:52:01.451 --> 01:52:02.284
<v Speaker 5>you just do it.</v>

3659
01:52:02.460 --> 01:52:03.131
<v Speaker 5>It's like that,</v>

3660
01:52:03.131 --> 01:52:05.120
<v Speaker 5>but in German it's like you,</v>

3661
01:52:05.240 --> 01:52:06.130
<v Speaker 5>you need to know that shit.</v>

3662
01:52:06.131 --> 01:52:07.360
<v Speaker 5>Otherwise you don't know what the fuck are you doing?</v>

3663
01:52:07.780 --> 01:52:08.141
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3664
01:52:08.141 --> 01:52:08.620
<v Speaker 5>You don't.</v>

3665
01:52:08.620 --> 01:52:09.450
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3666
01:52:09.450 --> 01:52:10.283
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

3667
01:52:11.690 --> 01:52:12.860
<v Speaker 5>genitive dative.</v>

3668
01:52:12.890 --> 01:52:15.550
<v Speaker 5>Nominative accusative.</v>

3669
01:52:15.600 --> 01:52:16.433
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3670
01:52:16.910 --> 01:52:18.010
<v Speaker 5>I'm forgetting all.</v>

3671
01:52:18.011 --> 01:52:18.950
<v Speaker 5>Would they finished?</v>

3672
01:52:19.180 --> 01:52:19.630
<v Speaker 5>Finished?</v>

3673
01:52:19.630 --> 01:52:20.840
<v Speaker 5>Has 14 cases.</v>

3674
01:52:22.810 --> 01:52:23.030
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3675
01:52:23.030 --> 01:52:23.730
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>

3676
01:52:23.730 --> 01:52:24.563
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3677
01:52:25.180 --> 01:52:25.720
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3678
01:52:25.720 --> 01:52:27.160
<v Speaker 5>my whole thing was like,</v>

3679
01:52:28.380 --> 01:52:29.213
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

3680
01:52:30.520 --> 01:52:32.500
<v Speaker 4>I don't think languages are very hard to learn,</v>

3681
01:52:33.550 --> 01:52:34.091
<v Speaker 4>but then again,</v>

3682
01:52:34.091 --> 01:52:35.140
<v Speaker 4>I don't think anything's</v>

3683
01:52:36.570 --> 01:52:38.180
<v Speaker 5>necessarily difficult to learn this.</v>

3684
01:52:38.460 --> 01:52:42.130
<v Speaker 5>You just put time and effort and that's unused move.</v>

3685
01:52:42.170 --> 01:52:42.961
<v Speaker 5>If you never use it,</v>

3686
01:52:42.961 --> 01:52:43.794
<v Speaker 5>you lose it.</v>

3687
01:52:44.250 --> 01:52:44.581
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3688
01:52:44.581 --> 01:52:45.860
<v Speaker 5>That's like my brain.</v>

3689
01:52:45.960 --> 01:52:46.930
<v Speaker 5>I</v>

3690
01:52:47.010 --> 01:52:50.350
<v Speaker 4>kind of wonder sometimes about A.</v>

3691
01:52:50.350 --> 01:52:51.590
<v Speaker 4>I kind of wonder sometimes about,</v>

3692
01:52:52.060 --> 01:52:52.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3693
01:52:52.340 --> 01:52:55.880
<v Speaker 4>what people mean maybe because they hadn't ever learned the language when they</v>

3694
01:52:55.881 --> 01:52:56.714
<v Speaker 4>were younger.</v>

3695
01:52:56.870 --> 01:52:59.420
<v Speaker 4>I'm like learning language.</v>

3696
01:52:59.421 --> 01:53:00.770
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't imagine doing that now.</v>

3697
01:53:00.771 --> 01:53:01.640
<v Speaker 4>Or people say that,</v>

3698
01:53:01.641 --> 01:53:01.821
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3699
01:53:01.821 --> 01:53:02.601
<v Speaker 4>when you get older,</v>

3700
01:53:02.601 --> 01:53:03.434
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3701
01:53:05.250 --> 01:53:09.540
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how old or what people would age people are necessarily referring</v>

3702
01:53:09.541 --> 01:53:09.781
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

3703
01:53:09.781 --> 01:53:11.120
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

3704
01:53:11.970 --> 01:53:15.570
<v Speaker 4>I guess I'm fortunate now that I think even if I was to try and learn language</v>

3705
01:53:15.571 --> 01:53:16.770
<v Speaker 4>now I,</v>

3706
01:53:17.020 --> 01:53:18.210
<v Speaker 4>I still could manage.</v>

3707
01:53:18.211 --> 01:53:19.170
<v Speaker 4>It may not be as easy,</v>

3708
01:53:19.171 --> 01:53:20.004
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

3709
01:53:22.040 --> 01:53:22.873
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

3710
01:53:23.670 --> 01:53:23.870
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3711
01:53:23.870 --> 01:53:24.461
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

3712
01:53:24.461 --> 01:53:25.870
<v Speaker 4>I think actually as I've gotten older,</v>

3713
01:53:25.871 --> 01:53:26.470
<v Speaker 4>I think I've,</v>

3714
01:53:26.470 --> 01:53:28.120
<v Speaker 4>I could probably learn it easier.</v>

3715
01:53:28.210 --> 01:53:29.080
<v Speaker 4>It's February,</v>

3716
01:53:29.440 --> 01:53:30.730
<v Speaker 4>I never got a chance to use it.</v>

3717
01:53:31.210 --> 01:53:33.580
<v Speaker 4>Like I can say some things and a lot of different languages,</v>

3718
01:53:33.581 --> 01:53:37.780
<v Speaker 4>but like the fact that I speak basically exclusively English and just a little</v>

3719
01:53:37.781 --> 01:53:38.620
<v Speaker 4>bit of Portuguese.</v>

3720
01:53:39.280 --> 01:53:41.440
<v Speaker 4>I'm a real shame because like,</v>

3721
01:53:41.850 --> 01:53:42.680
<v Speaker 4>but that's the thing,</v>

3722
01:53:42.680 --> 01:53:44.890
<v Speaker 4>what if I started using Portuguese all the time,</v>

3723
01:53:44.891 --> 01:53:47.950
<v Speaker 4>like I'm not going to use the Icelandic and if I use Icelandic all the time,</v>

3724
01:53:47.951 --> 01:53:49.300
<v Speaker 4>not going to use the Portuguese all the time,</v>

3725
01:53:49.301 --> 01:53:50.290
<v Speaker 4>so I'm going to lose something.</v>

3726
01:53:50.530 --> 01:53:51.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3727
01:53:51.070 --> 01:53:51.740
<v Speaker 4>So I,</v>

3728
01:53:51.740 --> 01:53:52.750
<v Speaker 4>I just consider it like,</v>

3729
01:53:52.751 --> 01:53:53.584
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3730
01:53:53.740 --> 01:53:57.120
<v Speaker 4>something I just do just to be just a,</v>

3731
01:53:57.550 --> 01:53:59.500
<v Speaker 4>it kinda gives you a different way of thinking too if you,</v>

3732
01:53:59.501 --> 01:54:02.090
<v Speaker 4>if you can learn a little bit about another language and if you don't like</v>

3733
01:54:02.170 --> 01:54:02.800
<v Speaker 4>become,</v>

3734
01:54:02.800 --> 01:54:03.730
<v Speaker 4>if you can read a little bit,</v>

3735
01:54:03.731 --> 01:54:04.564
<v Speaker 4>that's good too.</v>

3736
01:54:04.930 --> 01:54:06.220
<v Speaker 4>I think it just gives me like a different,</v>

3737
01:54:06.310 --> 01:54:07.143
<v Speaker 4>another brain,</v>

3738
01:54:07.160 --> 01:54:07.401
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3739
01:54:07.401 --> 01:54:07.770
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

3740
01:54:07.770 --> 01:54:08.380
<v Speaker 4>you're not,</v>

3741
01:54:08.380 --> 01:54:09.940
<v Speaker 4>you're certainly right about that.</v>

3742
01:54:09.941 --> 01:54:10.774
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3743
01:54:11.030 --> 01:54:11.863
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3744
01:54:13.270 --> 01:54:13.541
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

3745
01:54:13.541 --> 01:54:18.541
<v Speaker 4>So I worked for a metal fabricator for awhile who was from Poland and the way</v>

3746
01:54:19.931 --> 01:54:24.040
<v Speaker 4>that he would sometimes structure sentences or say things like,</v>

3747
01:54:25.260 --> 01:54:30.260
<v Speaker 4>and I don't know exactly how they're help Polish or whether it comes from or how</v>

3748
01:54:30.371 --> 01:54:31.121
<v Speaker 4>it's structured,</v>

3749
01:54:31.121 --> 01:54:31.900
<v Speaker 4>but I think,</v>

3750
01:54:31.900 --> 01:54:34.810
<v Speaker 4>I think you've been frozen or quiet that I missed.</v>

3751
01:54:34.811 --> 01:54:35.501
<v Speaker 4>I missed the last,</v>

3752
01:54:35.501 --> 01:54:36.190
<v Speaker 4>like three,</v>

3753
01:54:36.190 --> 01:54:37.210
<v Speaker 4>three or four seconds that.</v>

3754
01:54:38.170 --> 01:54:39.003
<v Speaker 4>Can you hear me now?</v>

3755
01:54:39.580 --> 01:54:40.350
<v Speaker 4>I can hear you now.</v>

3756
01:54:40.350 --> 01:54:41.890
<v Speaker 4>Just say it went okay.</v>

3757
01:54:42.160 --> 01:54:42.790
<v Speaker 4>It went.</v>

3758
01:54:42.790 --> 01:54:43.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3759
01:54:43.450 --> 01:54:43.721
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3760
01:54:43.721 --> 01:54:44.230
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

3761
01:54:44.230 --> 01:54:45.063
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3762
01:54:45.590 --> 01:54:46.271
<v Speaker 4>so yeah,</v>

3763
01:54:46.271 --> 01:54:51.271
<v Speaker 4>I think that in interacting with people from foreign countries,</v>

3764
01:54:51.890 --> 01:54:52.270
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3765
01:54:52.270 --> 01:54:55.750
<v Speaker 4>that I've been able to understand them better based off of</v>

3766
01:54:57.330 --> 01:54:57.880
<v Speaker 4>or.</v>

3767
01:54:57.880 --> 01:54:58.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3768
01:54:58.190 --> 01:55:00.420
<v Speaker 4>for my learning of German.</v>

3769
01:55:01.060 --> 01:55:01.893
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

3770
01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:03.721
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3771
01:55:03.721 --> 01:55:04.554
<v Speaker 4>I totally agree.</v>

3772
01:55:04.770 --> 01:55:06.000
<v Speaker 4>When you learn another language,</v>

3773
01:55:06.001 --> 01:55:07.740
<v Speaker 4>it provides a new perspective.</v>

3774
01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:09.450
<v Speaker 4>You think of thing,</v>

3775
01:55:09.550 --> 01:55:11.670
<v Speaker 4>you think things differently.</v>

3776
01:55:12.390 --> 01:55:14.430
<v Speaker 4>I mean these are all things that I've thought about in the past,</v>

3777
01:55:15.020 --> 01:55:15.570
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3778
01:55:15.570 --> 01:55:15.871
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3779
01:55:15.871 --> 01:55:20.871
<v Speaker 4>as pluses to having learned German and it's got to be pluses of just learning</v>

3780
01:55:21.270 --> 01:55:22.290
<v Speaker 4>languages in general.</v>

3781
01:55:23.500 --> 01:55:24.333
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3782
01:55:28.100 --> 01:55:28.311
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

01:55:28.311 --> 01:55:28.581
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

3784
01:55:28.581 --> 01:55:29.414

01:55:30.420 --> 01:55:30.960
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3786
01:55:30.960 --> 01:55:31.570

<v Speaker 4>are you still there?</v>

3788
01:55:32.241 --> 01:55:33.210
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm going to have.</v>

3789
01:55:33.890 --> 01:55:34.071
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3790
01:55:34.071 --> 01:55:34.904
<v Speaker 4>I'm still here.</v>

3791
01:55:35.110 --> 01:55:35.400
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

01:55:35.400 --> 01:55:36.233
<v Speaker 4>just making sure,</v>

3793
01:55:36.340 --> 01:55:37.173
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3794
01:55:38.150 --> 01:55:40.130
<v Speaker 4>I think for me,</v>

3795
01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:43.320
<v Speaker 4>like I went to Iceland so I was okay.</v>

3796
01:55:43.321 --> 01:55:44.160
<v Speaker 4>Well now</v>

3797
01:55:44.590 --> 01:55:45.371
<v Speaker 5>that made me interest.</v>

3798
01:55:45.371 --> 01:55:45.661
<v Speaker 5>I went to,</v>

3799
01:55:45.661 --> 01:55:46.650
<v Speaker 5>for all my first trip I went to,</v>

3800
01:55:46.651 --> 01:55:49.470
<v Speaker 5>I went to Russia and I tried to learn some of the Russian language when I went</v>

3801
01:55:49.471 --> 01:55:50.340
<v Speaker 5>there I was a student,</v>

3802
01:55:50.870 --> 01:55:51.490
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3803
01:55:51.490 --> 01:55:53.490
<v Speaker 5>I think it was like 17 and it was,</v>

3804
01:55:53.600 --> 01:55:54.750
<v Speaker 5>it was really awesome because like,</v>

3805
01:55:54.751 --> 01:55:58.110
<v Speaker 5>you've got to meet all these Russian kid like kids my age and they really</v>

3806
01:55:58.111 --> 01:55:59.480
<v Speaker 5>appreciated the fact that I give,</v>

3807
01:55:59.530 --> 01:56:00.050
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3808
01:56:00.050 --> 01:56:00.881
<v Speaker 5>gave her a whirl,</v>

3809
01:56:00.881 --> 01:56:01.510
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3810
01:56:01.510 --> 01:56:04.470
<v Speaker 5>so like I worked so hard on this one phrase,</v>

3811
01:56:04.471 --> 01:56:05.790
<v Speaker 5>I can actually still remember it.</v>

3812
01:56:06.060 --> 01:56:07.230
<v Speaker 5>It's like I can say like,</v>

3813
01:56:07.231 --> 01:56:08.550
<v Speaker 5>do you understand Russian or,</v>

3814
01:56:08.740 --> 01:56:09.573
<v Speaker 5>or uh,</v>

3815
01:56:09.920 --> 01:56:10.340
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3816
01:56:10.340 --> 01:56:11.173
<v Speaker 5>I can say,</v>

3817
01:56:11.340 --> 01:56:14.850
<v Speaker 5>do you understand Russian or I going to say I understand Russia and then I get</v>

3818
01:56:14.851 --> 01:56:17.300
<v Speaker 5>to the negatives of those so I don't understand Russian.</v>

3819
01:56:18.380 --> 01:56:19.213
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>

3820
01:56:19.290 --> 01:56:21.270
<v Speaker 5>but I really worked on those.</v>

3821
01:56:21.271 --> 01:56:21.621
<v Speaker 5>So I,</v>

3822
01:56:21.621 --> 01:56:23.490
<v Speaker 5>I still remember him today and I'm like 30.</v>

3823
01:56:23.490 --> 01:56:25.830
<v Speaker 5>So 13 years later I still haven't had.</v>

3824
01:56:26.160 --> 01:56:26.840
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3825
01:56:26.840 --> 01:56:27.960
<v Speaker 5>and then Icelandic,</v>

3826
01:56:27.961 --> 01:56:30.150
<v Speaker 5>I learned a bunch of different phrases,</v>

3827
01:56:30.270 --> 01:56:33.420
<v Speaker 5>but the weird thing is when you're trying to learn language on your own is like</v>

3828
01:56:33.421 --> 01:56:34.050
<v Speaker 5>the sound,</v>

3829
01:56:34.050 --> 01:56:36.990
<v Speaker 5>you always have the sound off because you don't have any way to bounce it off</v>

3830
01:56:36.991 --> 01:56:37.800
<v Speaker 5>of.</v>

3831
01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:40.740
<v Speaker 5>So when I got there I was trying to tell them where we're at,</v>

3832
01:56:40.741 --> 01:56:42.780
<v Speaker 5>my hotel or hotel,</v>

3833
01:56:42.781 --> 01:56:43.200
<v Speaker 5>but like,</v>

3834
01:56:43.200 --> 01:56:45.480
<v Speaker 5>like an airbnb or whatever it was.</v>

3835
01:56:46.080 --> 01:56:46.913
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

3836
01:56:47.460 --> 01:56:49.460
<v Speaker 5>I was saying like loud good deller,</v>

3837
01:56:49.710 --> 01:56:50.543
<v Speaker 5>which is like,</v>

3838
01:56:51.020 --> 01:56:54.160
<v Speaker 5>that's Nice logo there and uh,</v>

3839
01:56:54.270 --> 01:56:55.103
<v Speaker 5>that's how you say it.</v>

3840
01:56:55.200 --> 01:56:55.800
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

3841
01:56:55.800 --> 01:56:56.310
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

3842
01:56:56.310 --> 01:56:56.910
<v Speaker 5>but the,</v>

3843
01:56:56.910 --> 01:57:00.270
<v Speaker 5>it was interesting for me because in English it's like very simple.</v>

3844
01:57:00.271 --> 01:57:02.460
<v Speaker 5>Like the pronunciation for me is like really easy.</v>

3845
01:57:02.461 --> 01:57:03.960
<v Speaker 5>Even if someone has a different accent,</v>

3846
01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:05.130
<v Speaker 5>I could understand what you're saying.</v>

3847
01:57:05.370 --> 01:57:05.970
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3848
01:57:05.970 --> 01:57:07.140
<v Speaker 5>But for this guy,</v>

3849
01:57:07.141 --> 01:57:08.760
<v Speaker 5>because it's a totally different language,</v>

3850
01:57:08.820 --> 01:57:12.720
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what the different accents are and he doesn't know what my accent</v>

3851
01:57:12.721 --> 01:57:13.554
<v Speaker 5>is really.</v>

3852
01:57:13.590 --> 01:57:16.270
<v Speaker 5>So I have to say it like 15 different ways to.</v>

3853
01:57:16.280 --> 01:57:16.620
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

3854
01:57:16.620 --> 01:57:17.453
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3855
01:57:17.700 --> 01:57:18.420
<v Speaker 5>lower there.</v>

3856
01:57:18.420 --> 01:57:18.901
<v Speaker 5>And then I'm like,</v>

3857
01:57:18.901 --> 01:57:19.291
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

3858
01:57:19.291 --> 01:57:24.291
<v Speaker 5>So it just was unexpected things to happen with the colloquialisms.</v>

3859
01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:27.480
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3860
01:57:27.480 --> 01:57:28.800
<v Speaker 5>So if anybody wants to know how to say,</v>

3861
01:57:28.801 --> 01:57:29.240
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3862
01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:29.610
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3863
01:57:29.610 --> 01:57:31.790
<v Speaker 5>I understand Russian and Russian,</v>

3881
01:58:05.880 --> 01:58:06.870
<v Speaker 5>there was no word order.</v>

3882
01:58:06.871 --> 01:58:11.040
<v Speaker 5>I guess there was no official word order so you could say it like as long as you</v>

3883
01:58:11.041 --> 01:58:12.480
<v Speaker 5>have the words in the right case,</v>

01:58:12.481 --> 01:58:14.760
<v Speaker 5>you could say you could say the sentence any way,</v>

3885
01:58:14.820 --> 01:58:18.180
<v Speaker 5>which I guess helped when they were writing like poetry and stuff.</v>

3886
01:58:18.860 --> 01:58:19.693
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>

01:58:51.680 --> 01:58:52.690
<v Speaker 5>if it's English.</v>

3909
01:58:52.691 --> 01:58:53.500
<v Speaker 5>So you would say though,</v>

3910
01:58:53.500 --> 01:58:53.800
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3911
01:58:53.800 --> 01:58:55.380
<v Speaker 5>That's what the original one was out.</v>

3912
01:58:55.630 --> 01:58:59.260
<v Speaker 5>So that one through or visit the same word and you can find once you know that</v>

3913
01:58:59.261 --> 01:59:00.250
<v Speaker 5>there's all these cognates,</v>

3914
01:59:00.251 --> 01:59:02.050
<v Speaker 5>it's like way easier to learn that language.</v>

3915
01:59:02.360 --> 01:59:06.340
<v Speaker 5>It's very hard to pronounce a lot of the words because sometimes the words are</v>

3916
01:59:06.341 --> 01:59:07.390
<v Speaker 5>like German where that's like,</v>

3917
01:59:07.450 --> 01:59:08.050
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3918
01:59:08.050 --> 01:59:09.340
<v Speaker 5>16 characters long.</v>

3919
01:59:09.880 --> 01:59:10.510
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>

3920
01:59:10.510 --> 01:59:10.750
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3921
01:59:10.750 --> 01:59:11.590
<v Speaker 5>eventually figured out what.</v>

3922
01:59:11.591 --> 01:59:13.510
<v Speaker 5>That's just a bunch of compound words put together.</v>

3923
01:59:14.220 --> 01:59:15.053
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3924
01:59:15.550 --> 01:59:16.080
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3925
01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:16.240
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3926
01:59:16.240 --> 01:59:17.440
<v Speaker 5>German borrows from</v>

3927
01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:20.500
<v Speaker 5>Spanish French.</v>

3928
01:59:22.810 --> 01:59:23.081
<v Speaker 5>Sorry,</v>

3929
01:59:23.081 --> 01:59:23.914
<v Speaker 5>I missed that.</v>

3930
01:59:24.160 --> 01:59:27.580
<v Speaker 5>German has words that borrowed from Spanish and French.</v>

3931
01:59:29.500 --> 01:59:29.890
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

3932
01:59:29.890 --> 01:59:30.723
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>

3933
01:59:30.900 --> 01:59:31.733
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

3934
01:59:33.620 --> 01:59:33.871
<v Speaker 5>Actually,</v>

3935
01:59:33.871 --> 01:59:34.200
<v Speaker 5>I tried,</v>

3936
01:59:34.200 --> 01:59:37.560
<v Speaker 5>I tried to learn German while when I was a kid because my dad's,</v>

3937
01:59:37.620 --> 01:59:40.440
<v Speaker 5>one of my dad's girlfriends was Germanic and origin.</v>

3938
01:59:40.600 --> 01:59:42.270
<v Speaker 5>She was from like West Germany.</v>

3939
01:59:43.010 --> 01:59:43.843
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3940
01:59:44.790 --> 01:59:45.031
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

3943
01:59:46.320 --> 01:59:47.690
<v Speaker 5>I can't remember much else.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I kind of wished that I would in my third year German,</v>

3987
02:00:58.760 --> 02:01:01.400
<v Speaker 5>my junior year we were,</v>

3988
02:01:02.090 --> 02:01:04.760
<v Speaker 5>our final was to create a,</v>

3989
02:01:06.520 --> 02:01:08.140
<v Speaker 5>because we were reading the brothers</v>

3990
02:01:09.120 --> 02:01:09.953
<v Speaker 7>grim.</v>

3991
02:01:11.570 --> 02:01:11.971
<v Speaker 5>Oh really?</v>

3992
02:01:11.971 --> 02:01:14.540
<v Speaker 5>You're reading the brothers Karamazov no care.</v>

3993
02:01:14.600 --> 02:01:14.930
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3994
02:01:14.930 --> 02:01:19.360
<v Speaker 5>the brothers Grimm fairytales that the groups were,</v>

3995
02:01:19.370 --> 02:01:21.110
<v Speaker 5>all the fairytales actually originated from,</v>

3996
02:01:21.111 --> 02:01:26.111
<v Speaker 5>from the graphic gruesome tales that were told to the grim grim.</v>

3997
02:01:28.041 --> 02:01:28.730
<v Speaker 5>They like,</v>

3998
02:01:28.730 --> 02:01:31.610
<v Speaker 5>they wanted them down too because they were even more gruesome than they wrote.</v>

3999
02:01:32.240 --> 02:01:33.020
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4000
02:01:33.020 --> 02:01:33.853
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

4001
02:01:34.700 --> 02:01:36.920
<v Speaker 5>so yeah,</v>

4002
02:01:36.921 --> 02:01:39.140
<v Speaker 5>so our thing was we'll create a fairytale.</v>

4003
02:01:39.230 --> 02:01:40.160
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't matter.</v>

4004
02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:45.260
<v Speaker 1>You can make it as graphic as you want and I can't remember what I made mine,</v>

4005
02:01:45.261 --> 02:01:50.261
<v Speaker 1>but I wish I still had that so I could know so I could bring that up.</v>

4006
02:01:51.831 --> 02:01:52.161
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

4007
02:01:52.161 --> 02:01:55.310
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes I try and remember words or</v>

4011
02:01:58.640 --> 02:02:00.140
<v Speaker 1>as far as the grammar goes,</v>

4012
02:02:01.310 --> 02:02:05.390
<v Speaker 1>now I would have a hard time remembering,</v>

4013
02:02:05.480 --> 02:02:06.171
<v Speaker 1>but it was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>The defensive shots don't know.</v>

4020

02:03:37.980 --> 02:03:38.980
<v Speaker 1>have a on.</v>

4055
02:03:38.990 --> 02:03:39.821
<v Speaker 1>I'm something.</v>

4056
02:03:39.821 --> 02:03:41.300
<v Speaker 1>Something good,</v>

4057
02:03:41.750 --> 02:03:43.090
<v Speaker 1>get in the verb,</v>

4058
02:03:43.120 --> 02:03:43.953
<v Speaker 1>gift far and,</v>

4059
02:03:44.080 --> 02:03:44.910
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

4060
02:03:44.910 --> 02:03:45.743
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

4061
02:03:46.230 --> 02:03:49.370
<v Speaker 1>give live in or a need or a</v>

4062
02:03:51.220 --> 02:03:52.053
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

4063
02:03:53.820 --> 02:03:54.181
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4064
02:03:54.181 --> 02:03:58.530
<v Speaker 1>it always comes at the end of the gift slash verb always comes at the end when</v>

4065
02:03:58.531 --> 02:04:03.210
<v Speaker 1>you were asking or when you're talking about past participle or past tense shit.</v>

4066
02:04:03.300 --> 02:04:03.451
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4067
02:04:03.451 --> 02:04:04.284
<v Speaker 1>Past tense.</v>

4068
02:04:04.780 --> 02:04:05.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4069
02:04:05.470 --> 02:04:05.551
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4070
02:04:05.551 --> 02:04:06.384
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>

4071
02:04:07.510 --> 02:04:08.343
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

4072
02:04:09.620 --> 02:04:10.280
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4073
02:04:10.280 --> 02:04:14.090
<v Speaker 1>I was good at at one time and I spoke it well.</v>

4074
02:04:14.091 --> 02:04:14.361
<v Speaker 1>Do.</v>

4075
02:04:14.361 --> 02:04:15.194
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

4076
02:04:16.130 --> 02:04:16.760
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

4077
02:04:16.760 --> 02:04:17.670
<v Speaker 1>it's so,</v>

4078
02:04:17.950 --> 02:04:21.460
<v Speaker 1>it's worthwhile looking into once in a while I'll just refresh your mind to it.</v>

4079
02:04:21.560 --> 02:04:22.393
<v Speaker 1>I think it kind of,</v>

4080
02:04:22.800 --> 02:04:24.320
<v Speaker 1>it keeps your brain thinking.</v>

4081
02:04:25.300 --> 02:04:26.133
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4082
02:04:27.100 --> 02:04:28.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to ever hurt,</v>

4083
02:04:28.071 --> 02:04:28.904
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4084
02:04:29.380 --> 02:04:29.730
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4085
02:04:29.730 --> 02:04:30.563
<v Speaker 1>it can.</v>

4086
02:04:32.340 --> 02:04:33.200
<v Speaker 1>You don't do it enough.</v>

4087
02:04:33.201 --> 02:04:33.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4088
02:04:33.520 --> 02:04:34.353
<v Speaker 1>Can hurt.</v>

4089
02:04:36.200 --> 02:04:37.110
<v Speaker 1>It can hurt a little bit.</v>

4090
02:04:37.111 --> 02:04:37.944
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4091
02:04:39.350 --> 02:04:39.780
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4092
02:04:39.780 --> 02:04:40.250
<v Speaker 5>but you're right.</v>

4093
02:04:40.250 --> 02:04:40.710
<v Speaker 5>It,</v>

4094
02:04:40.710 --> 02:04:43.650
<v Speaker 5>we can never hurt to keep learning.</v>

4095
02:04:43.780 --> 02:04:44.613
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4096
02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:48.513
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

4097
02:04:50.790 --> 02:04:51.050
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

4098
02:04:51.050 --> 02:04:53.870
<v Speaker 5>So I could bring up the number of the idea I was talking about yesterday about</v>

4099
02:04:54.070 --> 02:04:54.270
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

4100
02:04:54.270 --> 02:04:54.561
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4101
02:04:54.561 --> 02:04:59.561
<v Speaker 5>a resentment towards people with massive wealth and the isn't,</v>

4102
02:05:00.780 --> 02:05:03.310
<v Speaker 5>it's not something I wrote about it,</v>

4103
02:05:03.311 --> 02:05:04.960
<v Speaker 5>but I just want to make sure it's a.</v>

4104
02:05:05.870 --> 02:05:06.270
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

4105
02:05:06.270 --> 02:05:07.700
<v Speaker 5>I'll just read it from the start.</v>

4106
02:05:08.160 --> 02:05:09.140
<v Speaker 5>There's a snobbery long.</v>

4107
02:05:09.650 --> 02:05:10.483
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4108
02:05:11.090 --> 02:05:11.691
<v Speaker 5>so everybody,</v>

4109
02:05:11.691 --> 02:05:12.770
<v Speaker 5>this is just an idea that like,</v>

4110
02:05:12.771 --> 02:05:15.680
<v Speaker 5>resentment towards people that hold a massive wealth,</v>

4111
02:05:16.050 --> 02:05:16.883
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4112
02:05:17.390 --> 02:05:19.170
<v Speaker 5>the people that are mad that rich people are,</v>

4113
02:05:19.390 --> 02:05:19.760
<v Speaker 5>they are,</v>

4114
02:05:19.760 --> 02:05:20.593
<v Speaker 5>they got nothing.</v>

4115
02:05:20.900 --> 02:05:21.441
<v Speaker 5>Fair enough.</v>

4116
02:05:21.441 --> 02:05:22.280
<v Speaker 5>I understand that.</v>

4117
02:05:22.281 --> 02:05:24.980
<v Speaker 5>But here's something I wrote about that idea.</v>

4118
02:05:25.850 --> 02:05:28.610
<v Speaker 5>Let's think about some guy who has made something useful.</v>

4119
02:05:28.850 --> 02:05:29.683
<v Speaker 5>If you want to give me,</v>

4120
02:05:29.780 --> 02:05:30.860
<v Speaker 5>if you want an example,</v>

4121
02:05:31.440 --> 02:05:32.850
<v Speaker 5>I'll use sit,</v>

4122
02:05:32.870 --> 02:05:35.400
<v Speaker 5>say Bill Gates because it's easy now.</v>

4123
02:05:35.401 --> 02:05:37.730
<v Speaker 5>A bill didn't really do a whole lot according to the cynics,</v>

4124
02:05:37.731 --> 02:05:42.020
<v Speaker 5>but as well with a his boss would show otherwise for what it's worth.</v>

4125
02:05:42.020 --> 02:05:46.100
<v Speaker 5>He revolutionized personal computing even though he just reebok's other people's</v>

4126
02:05:46.101 --> 02:05:46.934
<v Speaker 5>shit together.</v>

4127
02:05:47.150 --> 02:05:48.280
<v Speaker 5>Built becomes a billionaire,</v>

4128
02:05:48.290 --> 02:05:48.441
<v Speaker 5>blah,</v>

4129
02:05:48.441 --> 02:05:48.561
<v Speaker 5>blah,</v>

4130
02:05:48.561 --> 02:05:48.980
<v Speaker 5>blah,</v>

4131
02:05:48.980 --> 02:05:49.880
<v Speaker 5>and here we are today.</v>

4132
02:05:50.660 --> 02:05:54.290
<v Speaker 5>Why was he allowed to accumulate all that wealth so much wealth in fact,</v>

4133
02:05:54.350 --> 02:05:58.670
<v Speaker 5>that it'd be impossible for him to spend it in his lifetime and his own anyways,</v>

4134
02:05:58.730 --> 02:06:00.440
<v Speaker 5>that seems unfair and it maybe it is,</v>

4135
02:06:01.160 --> 02:06:06.140
<v Speaker 5>but he was the one who was initially rewarded for this innovation over the whole</v>

4136
02:06:06.141 --> 02:06:06.561
<v Speaker 5>society,</v>

4137
02:06:06.561 --> 02:06:09.470
<v Speaker 5>benefits from his innovation regardless and over time,</v>

4138
02:06:09.471 --> 02:06:12.380
<v Speaker 5>the entirety of his wealth and return to the entirety of society.</v>

4139
02:06:12.890 --> 02:06:15.560
<v Speaker 5>Eighty percent of inherited wealth is gone by the third generation.</v>

4140
02:06:15.940 --> 02:06:16.970
<v Speaker 5>It could be up to 90 percent,</v>

4141
02:06:18.710 --> 02:06:22.100
<v Speaker 5>so now with the amount of relative freedom compared to the past,</v>

4142
02:06:22.130 --> 02:06:25.900
<v Speaker 5>we can see a huge gap between the richest and the rest below,</v>

4143
02:06:26.200 --> 02:06:29.480
<v Speaker 5>but all those rich people have created their fortunes by developing new ideas</v>

4144
02:06:29.481 --> 02:06:30.590
<v Speaker 5>and tools and whatnot.</v>

4145
02:06:31.190 --> 02:06:35.090
<v Speaker 5>That's the infrastructure over time that just becomes part of everyone's living</v>

4146
02:06:35.091 --> 02:06:35.924
<v Speaker 5>standards.</v>

4147
02:06:36.050 --> 02:06:37.460
<v Speaker 5>And so and so,</v>

4148
02:06:37.461 --> 02:06:39.110
<v Speaker 5>they rise in totality over time.</v>

4149
02:06:39.650 --> 02:06:40.310
<v Speaker 5>However,</v>

4150
02:06:40.310 --> 02:06:41.450
<v Speaker 5>there is a delay issue.</v>

4151
02:06:41.870 --> 02:06:46.040
<v Speaker 5>It takes a few generations for that totality to accumulate in the bottom portion</v>

4152
02:06:46.130 --> 02:06:47.570
<v Speaker 5>of wealth distribution.</v>

4153
02:06:48.860 --> 02:06:49.790
<v Speaker 5>A good example,</v>

4154
02:06:49.880 --> 02:06:53.380
<v Speaker 5>another one might be Isaac Newton's Principia Mathematica,</v>

4155
02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:57.890
<v Speaker 5>no one you or I know is making money off of that information,</v>

4156
02:06:57.980 --> 02:07:02.450
<v Speaker 5>which is just book he wrote on physics because it was so long ago that the</v>

4157
02:07:02.451 --> 02:07:05.300
<v Speaker 5>knowledge has become part of the overall societal infrastructure.</v>

4158
02:07:06.140 --> 02:07:08.240
<v Speaker 5>So when we're speaking of wealth redistribution,</v>

4159
02:07:08.780 --> 02:07:11.570
<v Speaker 5>we're really speaking about doing a boat,</v>

4160
02:07:11.571 --> 02:07:14.360
<v Speaker 5>doing so about doing so more quickly,</v>

4161
02:07:15.310 --> 02:07:16.610
<v Speaker 5>but that creates a huge problem.</v>

4162
02:07:17.060 --> 02:07:18.380
<v Speaker 5>By doing so more quickly,</v>

4163
02:07:18.410 --> 02:07:21.440
<v Speaker 5>you might end up removing that incentive to do things at all.</v>

4164
02:07:21.920 --> 02:07:22.221
<v Speaker 5>You might,</v>

4165
02:07:22.221 --> 02:07:22.881
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

4166
02:07:22.881 --> 02:07:25.580
<v Speaker 5>see the lack of development in places like the SSR,</v>

4167
02:07:26.180 --> 02:07:29.660
<v Speaker 5>which really began to lag behind the west quite dramatically.</v>

4168
02:07:30.560 --> 02:07:31.480
<v Speaker 5>If we removed the ice,</v>

4169
02:07:31.660 --> 02:07:32.510
<v Speaker 5>that incentive,</v>

4170
02:07:33.140 --> 02:07:34.820
<v Speaker 5>which if you look at it generationally,</v>

4171
02:07:35.480 --> 02:07:36.313
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4172
02:07:38.710 --> 02:07:40.210
<v Speaker 5>is a very low price to pay,</v>

4173
02:07:40.730 --> 02:07:44.200
<v Speaker 5>we might end up removing the increase in living standards over time,</v>

4174
02:07:44.350 --> 02:07:47.950
<v Speaker 5>which of course will only be harvested fully after three generations,</v>

4175
02:07:48.910 --> 02:07:49.690
<v Speaker 5>three generations.</v>

4176
02:07:49.690 --> 02:07:53.650
<v Speaker 5>Which if you remember approximately how long the ceasar lasted.</v>

4177
02:07:54.110 --> 02:07:54.550
<v Speaker 5>That was,</v>

4178
02:07:54.550 --> 02:07:55.361
<v Speaker 5>that was the end of that one.</v>

4179
02:07:55.361 --> 02:07:56.560
<v Speaker 5>I have nothing else.</v>

4180
02:07:56.830 --> 02:07:57.420
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4181
02:07:57.420 --> 02:07:57.710
<v Speaker 5>What do you,</v>

4182
02:07:57.710 --> 02:07:58.543
<v Speaker 5>what do you think of that?</v>

4183
02:07:59.400 --> 02:07:59.731
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4184
02:07:59.731 --> 02:08:00.120
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4185
02:08:00.120 --> 02:08:01.980
<v Speaker 1>I find it more interesting that you type.</v>

4186
02:08:02.500 --> 02:08:02.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4187
02:08:02.850 --> 02:08:03.111
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

4188
02:08:03.111 --> 02:08:04.590
<v Speaker 1>you kind of talked about it yet,</v>

4189
02:08:04.610 --> 02:08:04.890
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

4190
02:08:04.890 --> 02:08:06.270
<v Speaker 1>you did mention it yesterday.</v>

4191
02:08:06.690 --> 02:08:07.523
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4192
02:08:07.890 --> 02:08:08.723
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4193
02:08:09.450 --> 02:08:10.470
<v Speaker 1>the idea that,</v>

4194
02:08:10.620 --> 02:08:11.453
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4195
02:08:11.610 --> 02:08:15.530
<v Speaker 1>you have someone that comes from someplace or you know,</v>

4196
02:08:15.600 --> 02:08:16.920
<v Speaker 1>wealth is generated,</v>

4197
02:08:17.660 --> 02:08:17.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4198
02:08:17.870 --> 02:08:18.180
<v Speaker 1>you have</v>

4199
02:08:18.180 --> 02:08:19.440
<v Speaker 5>migrants that come over,</v>

4200
02:08:19.470 --> 02:08:20.490
<v Speaker 5>they work hard,</v>

4201
02:08:21.050 --> 02:08:21.450
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4202
02:08:21.450 --> 02:08:23.610
<v Speaker 5>typically three generations down the line,</v>

4203
02:08:23.611 --> 02:08:24.391
<v Speaker 5>wealth is lost.</v>

4204
02:08:24.391 --> 02:08:28.680
<v Speaker 5>I was only applying that to a immigrants,</v>

4205
02:08:28.681 --> 02:08:29.100
<v Speaker 5>but I,</v>

4206
02:08:29.100 --> 02:08:29.731
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

4207
02:08:29.731 --> 02:08:34.731
<v Speaker 1>you helped me realize that that's a.</v>

4208
02:08:35.280 --> 02:08:36.570
<v Speaker 1>am I right in thinking that that's,</v>

4209
02:08:36.670 --> 02:08:39.190
<v Speaker 5>it's true across the board that typically when a,</v>

4210
02:08:39.280 --> 02:08:42.010
<v Speaker 5>when wealth is created within three generations,</v>

4211
02:08:42.011 --> 02:08:42.844
<v Speaker 5>it's lost.</v>

4212
02:08:43.320 --> 02:08:45.220
<v Speaker 5>Like just doesn't have to be an immigrant.</v>

4213
02:08:46.460 --> 02:08:47.293
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4214
02:08:48.160 --> 02:08:49.390
<v Speaker 5>So I didn't know that.</v>

4215
02:08:49.600 --> 02:08:50.080
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4216
02:08:50.080 --> 02:08:50.913
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

4217
02:08:51.460 --> 02:08:52.293
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4218
02:08:52.300 --> 02:08:53.140
<v Speaker 5>when you mentioned,</v>

4219
02:08:53.550 --> 02:08:54.383
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4220
02:08:55.230 --> 02:08:55.540
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4221
02:08:55.540 --> 02:08:57.760
<v Speaker 5>Russia's a,</v>

4222
02:08:57.820 --> 02:08:58.900
<v Speaker 5>the USSR,</v>

4223
02:08:59.410 --> 02:08:59.800
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4224
02:08:59.800 --> 02:09:00.633
<v Speaker 6>falling,</v>

4225
02:09:01.310 --> 02:09:02.143
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4226
02:09:03.070 --> 02:09:03.281
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

4227
02:09:03.281 --> 02:09:03.521
<v Speaker 5>Their,</v>

4228
02:09:03.521 --> 02:09:03.791
<v Speaker 5>their,</v>

4229
02:09:03.791 --> 02:09:07.180
<v Speaker 5>their economy was the size of California in the 19 eighties.</v>

4230
02:09:07.850 --> 02:09:09.370
<v Speaker 5>That was before the tech boom and stuff.</v>

4231
02:09:09.371 --> 02:09:12.910
<v Speaker 5>And then even now Russia's economy is the size of a New York state,</v>

4232
02:09:14.290 --> 02:09:16.660
<v Speaker 5>which is quite dramatically different than the USA</v>

4233
02:09:18.160 --> 02:09:22.030
<v Speaker 1>and that they only lasted for about three generations.</v>

4234
02:09:23.050 --> 02:09:26.020
<v Speaker 1>Meaning that the meaning that they will</v>

4235
02:09:26.090 --> 02:09:30.200
<v Speaker 5>probably a feasting on the wealth that</v>

4236
02:09:30.550 --> 02:09:31.383
<v Speaker 6>had been,</v>

4237
02:09:32.990 --> 02:09:33.200
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4238
02:09:33.200 --> 02:09:34.310
<v Speaker 5>previously created</v>

4239
02:09:36.750 --> 02:09:41.750
<v Speaker 5>as a new scenario in a creation myth where the Anunnaki feast upon the body of</v>

4240
02:09:42.321 --> 02:09:43.154
<v Speaker 5>absolute.</v>

4241
02:09:43.210 --> 02:09:43.850
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4242
02:09:43.850 --> 02:09:44.683
<v Speaker 5>That was interesting.</v>

4243
02:09:46.180 --> 02:09:46.520
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4244
02:09:46.520 --> 02:09:48.410
<v Speaker 5>It can't be done in perpetuity because,</v>

4245
02:09:48.770 --> 02:09:49.270
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4246
02:09:49.270 --> 02:09:51.680
<v Speaker 5>and this is obviously from Peterson because he talks about this,</v>

4247
02:09:52.400 --> 02:09:53.233
<v Speaker 5>but um,</v>

4248
02:09:53.300 --> 02:09:55.820
<v Speaker 5>so if people are familiar,</v>

4249
02:09:55.910 --> 02:09:59.800
<v Speaker 5>a Marta is the one who eventually overcomes time at.</v>

4250
02:09:59.810 --> 02:10:03.830
<v Speaker 5>But in the beginning there's absolute and time at and the children and they're</v>

4251
02:10:03.831 --> 02:10:08.831
<v Speaker 5>called the Anunnaki and they kill a absolute of boredom and feast upon his</v>

4252
02:10:12.080 --> 02:10:13.370
<v Speaker 5>corpse and party and stuff.</v>

4253
02:10:13.371 --> 02:10:15.820
<v Speaker 5>And that pisses off time at obviously,</v>

4254
02:10:15.830 --> 02:10:16.521
<v Speaker 5>and then you know,</v>

4255
02:10:16.521 --> 02:10:17.354
<v Speaker 5>the story,</v>

4256
02:10:18.020 --> 02:10:22.190
<v Speaker 5>eventually they come to the trend defeat time and the only one that eventually</v>

4257
02:10:22.191 --> 02:10:26.030
<v Speaker 5>does is martech and he creates the world out of her pieces,</v>

4258
02:10:26.031 --> 02:10:27.380
<v Speaker 5>which is a story,</v>

4259
02:10:27.700 --> 02:10:28.533
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4260
02:10:28.750 --> 02:10:29.583
<v Speaker 5>renewal.</v>

4261
02:10:29.930 --> 02:10:33.050
<v Speaker 5>And one thing we see with the baby boomer,</v>

4262
02:10:33.090 --> 02:10:34.640
<v Speaker 5>maybe not all baby boomers,</v>

4263
02:10:35.660 --> 02:10:37.370
<v Speaker 5>baby boomers and millennials,</v>

4264
02:10:37.670 --> 02:10:40.570
<v Speaker 5>is they want to feast upon the corpse of absolute buy in.</v>

4265
02:10:40.650 --> 02:10:43.940
<v Speaker 5>And they symbolize this through the idea of eating the rich.</v>

4266
02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.400
<v Speaker 5>And this is often seen in communist ideals.</v>

4267
02:10:47.060 --> 02:10:51.190
<v Speaker 5>And the problem with it is that you end up at the same issue in this scenario</v>

4268
02:10:51.210 --> 02:10:53.570
<v Speaker 5>mythology where if you</v>

4269
02:10:55.710 --> 02:10:57.800
<v Speaker 5>try to feast upon what exists now,</v>

4270
02:10:57.830 --> 02:11:00.650
<v Speaker 5>you'll eventually run out and then you won't have innovated and in your</v>

4271
02:11:00.651 --> 02:11:02.930
<v Speaker 5>solutions to your problem of starvation.</v>

4272
02:11:03.450 --> 02:11:04.283
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

4273
02:11:04.530 --> 02:11:05.363
<v Speaker 7>no</v>

4274
02:11:06.490 --> 02:11:08.720
<v Speaker 5>a metaphor that one,</v>

4275
02:11:09.080 --> 02:11:09.351
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

4276
02:11:09.351 --> 02:11:09.770
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4277
02:11:09.770 --> 02:11:13.310
<v Speaker 5>you end up at the same problem that the Anunnaki came work we're going to face,</v>

4278
02:11:13.311 --> 02:11:15.410
<v Speaker 5>which was the chaos dragon,</v>

4279
02:11:16.340 --> 02:11:20.170
<v Speaker 5>which is symbolized by tying that in the scenario and myth.</v>

4280
02:11:20.670 --> 02:11:21.440
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4281
02:11:21.440 --> 02:11:26.420
<v Speaker 5>so what is wrong is they try to feast upon the,</v>

4282
02:11:26.421 --> 02:11:27.254
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4283
02:11:27.400 --> 02:11:28.220
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>

4284
02:11:28.220 --> 02:11:29.053
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

4285
02:11:29.490 --> 02:11:33.580
<v Speaker 5>I guess there's ours and that wealth dependency runs out at for some time.</v>

4286
02:11:33.610 --> 02:11:34.770
<v Speaker 5>The USSR did grow,</v>

4287
02:11:34.771 --> 02:11:37.200
<v Speaker 5>but they're not at the pace of the USA then.</v>

4288
02:11:37.620 --> 02:11:37.891
<v Speaker 5>Sorry,</v>

4289
02:11:37.891 --> 02:11:38.724
<v Speaker 5>go ahead.</v>

4290
02:11:39.490 --> 02:11:39.641
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4291
02:11:39.641 --> 02:11:40.520
<v Speaker 1>I was going to ask you,</v>

4292
02:11:40.550 --> 02:11:42.490
<v Speaker 1>why do you think that that's.</v>

4293
02:11:42.790 --> 02:11:44.150
<v Speaker 1>You already mentioned that it,</v>

4294
02:11:44.151 --> 02:11:44.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4295
02:11:44.350 --> 02:11:49.350
<v Speaker 1>it's among the baby boomers and other generations in between even,</v>

4296
02:11:49.780 --> 02:11:50.121
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4297
02:11:50.121 --> 02:11:51.430
<v Speaker 1>you didn't say gen x,</v>

4298
02:11:51.431 --> 02:11:52.110
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

4299
02:11:52.110 --> 02:11:52.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4300
02:11:52.460 --> 02:11:53.320
<v Speaker 1>the millennials to,</v>

4301
02:11:53.321 --> 02:11:53.531
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4302
02:11:53.531 --> 02:11:56.380
<v Speaker 1>do you think that that's kind of happening?</v>

4303
02:11:58.080 --> 02:11:59.360
<v Speaker 5>That's happening now?</v>

4304
02:12:00.560 --> 02:12:00.920
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4305
02:12:00.920 --> 02:12:01.753
<v Speaker 5>obviously,</v>

4306
02:12:01.820 --> 02:12:02.151
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4307
02:12:02.151 --> 02:12:04.160
<v Speaker 1>it's a generalization that is happening now.</v>

4308
02:12:06.290 --> 02:12:06.511
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4309
02:12:06.511 --> 02:12:06.591
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

4310
02:12:06.591 --> 02:12:09.010
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of funny because if you look at a concierge test,</v>

4311
02:12:09.140 --> 02:12:12.080
<v Speaker 5>she is like symbolically the Anunnaki,</v>

4312
02:12:12.490 --> 02:12:15.580
<v Speaker 5>like she's like the mouthpiece of the Anunnaki and what,</v>

4313
02:12:15.581 --> 02:12:17.210
<v Speaker 5>she doesn't realize this because she's not,</v>

4314
02:12:17.220 --> 02:12:17.790
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

4315
02:12:17.790 --> 02:12:18.860
<v Speaker 5>she's not well educated</v>

4316
02:12:20.420 --> 02:12:24.050
<v Speaker 5>or at least in terms of like mythology.</v>

4317
02:12:24.051 --> 02:12:25.040
<v Speaker 5>She's not well educated,</v>

4318
02:12:25.220 --> 02:12:26.630
<v Speaker 5>which is a huge mistake by the way.</v>

4319
02:12:26.631 --> 02:12:27.320
<v Speaker 5>Everyone should,</v>

4320
02:12:27.320 --> 02:12:27.500
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

4321
02:12:27.500 --> 02:12:29.570
<v Speaker 5>that's a mistake I definitely made growing up.</v>

4322
02:12:29.571 --> 02:12:30.890
<v Speaker 5>I should have learned more about this.</v>

4323
02:12:31.220 --> 02:12:31.900
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

4324
02:12:31.900 --> 02:12:32.590
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4325
02:12:32.590 --> 02:12:34.460
<v Speaker 5>she's not well educated in these mythologies,</v>

4326
02:12:34.461 --> 02:12:39.461
<v Speaker 5>which is a very big detriment because you can learn so many things are so deep.</v>

4327
02:12:40.910 --> 02:12:41.560
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>

4328
02:12:41.560 --> 02:12:45.170
<v Speaker 5>she is the mouthpiece of the Anunnaki side of that story.</v>

4329
02:12:45.770 --> 02:12:46.603
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4330
02:12:47.690 --> 02:12:48.523
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

4331
02:12:48.760 --> 02:12:53.270
<v Speaker 5>which unfortunately she probably won't be alive long enough to learn because it</v>

4332
02:12:53.271 --> 02:12:57.710
<v Speaker 5>takes several generations to devour a course metaphorically.</v>

4333
02:12:59.760 --> 02:13:04.580
<v Speaker 5>She might not be around to even see the damage she's going to cause moving</v>

4334
02:13:04.581 --> 02:13:05.210
<v Speaker 5>forward.</v>

4335
02:13:05.210 --> 02:13:06.440
<v Speaker 5>Everyone else has moving forward.</v>

4336
02:13:06.441 --> 02:13:06.591
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

4337
02:13:06.591 --> 02:13:07.700
<v Speaker 5>So you're going to be behind,</v>

4338
02:13:08.280 --> 02:13:08.671
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4339
02:13:08.671 --> 02:13:09.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4340
02:13:09.480 --> 02:13:10.313
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

4341
02:13:11.310 --> 02:13:11.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4342
02:13:11.820 --> 02:13:13.020
<v Speaker 1>who knows what,</v>

4343
02:13:13.360 --> 02:13:14.193
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4344
02:13:14.610 --> 02:13:15.443
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4345
02:13:17.240 --> 02:13:18.290
<v Speaker 5>who knows what,</v>

4346
02:13:20.490 --> 02:13:21.810
<v Speaker 1>how China feels about</v>

4347
02:13:22.080 --> 02:13:23.550
<v Speaker 7>no her and</v>

4348
02:13:25.630 --> 02:13:26.460
<v Speaker 5>what China.</v>

4349
02:13:26.460 --> 02:13:28.710
<v Speaker 5>It's like they're eventually,</v>

4350
02:13:29.130 --> 02:13:30.450
<v Speaker 5>because I know they're close,</v>

4351
02:13:30.480 --> 02:13:32.670
<v Speaker 5>they're much closely tied to us then,</v>

4352
02:13:33.090 --> 02:13:33.600
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4353
02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:34.433
<v Speaker 5>then a lot of people,</v>

4354
02:13:36.030 --> 02:13:37.140
<v Speaker 5>I see a lot of people who do,</v>

4355
02:13:37.141 --> 02:13:37.471
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4356
02:13:37.471 --> 02:13:38.304
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

4357
02:13:41.070 --> 02:13:41.540
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4358
02:13:41.540 --> 02:13:44.820
<v Speaker 5>what's the problem with China is like they have to spend so much money on</v>

4359
02:13:44.821 --> 02:13:45.840
<v Speaker 5>enforcement cost,</v>

4360
02:13:46.750 --> 02:13:47.583
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4361
02:13:48.240 --> 02:13:49.980
<v Speaker 5>though they are extremely highly productive.</v>

4362
02:13:50.100 --> 02:13:51.630
<v Speaker 5>But I think eventually they lose.</v>

4363
02:13:51.660 --> 02:13:56.220
<v Speaker 5>They're going to lose that momentum and people are going to start wanting more</v>

4364
02:13:56.221 --> 02:13:57.054
<v Speaker 5>freedom.</v>

4365
02:13:57.110 --> 02:13:57.871
<v Speaker 5>It might not happen,</v>

4366
02:13:57.871 --> 02:13:59.760
<v Speaker 5>but that's my guess.</v>

4367
02:13:59.960 --> 02:14:00.411
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4368
02:14:00.411 --> 02:14:00.780
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4369
02:14:00.780 --> 02:14:02.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4370
02:14:02.271 --> 02:14:04.280
<v Speaker 4>I've just kind of derailed the thing,</v>

4371
02:14:04.281 --> 02:14:05.600
<v Speaker 4>but I definitely think that,</v>

4372
02:14:05.630 --> 02:14:05.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4373
02:14:05.900 --> 02:14:08.660
<v Speaker 4>they'll lose productivity at some point.</v>

4374
02:14:08.770 --> 02:14:09.200
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4375
02:14:09.200 --> 02:14:10.850
<v Speaker 4>if people don't stand up then that,</v>

4376
02:14:10.940 --> 02:14:13.530
<v Speaker 4>then this is then you could just</v>

4377
02:14:13.620 --> 02:14:14.770
<v Speaker 5>see soon as rope.</v>

4378
02:14:15.430 --> 02:14:16.510
<v Speaker 5>What as robots come in,</v>

4379
02:14:16.520 --> 02:14:19.840
<v Speaker 5>they're done like as soon as the robots are really.</v>

4380
02:14:20.500 --> 02:14:21.520
<v Speaker 5>They're pretty widespread now,</v>

4381
02:14:21.521 --> 02:14:24.070
<v Speaker 5>but as soon as they're like the main productive capacity,</v>

4382
02:14:24.071 --> 02:14:26.110
<v Speaker 5>like you can build them in your backyard.</v>

4383
02:14:26.140 --> 02:14:27.910
<v Speaker 5>Like China's going to have no,</v>

4384
02:14:28.540 --> 02:14:29.373
<v Speaker 5>no economy.</v>

4385
02:14:31.030 --> 02:14:33.070
<v Speaker 4>I mean not any more than we go.</v>

4386
02:14:33.160 --> 02:14:33.430
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

4387
02:14:33.430 --> 02:14:37.180
<v Speaker 4>what do you mean as far as manufacturing or doing anything?</v>

4388
02:14:39.460 --> 02:14:39.680
<v Speaker 5>Sorry,</v>

4389
02:14:39.680 --> 02:14:40.513
<v Speaker 5>sorry,</v>

4390
02:14:40.630 --> 02:14:41.311
<v Speaker 5>I missed the first.</v>

4391
02:14:41.311 --> 02:14:42.480
<v Speaker 5>After the first.</v>

4392
02:14:42.540 --> 02:14:45.180
<v Speaker 5>The first part of that question is blanked out in,</v>

4393
02:14:45.181 --> 02:14:45.310
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4394
02:14:45.310 --> 02:14:46.440
<v Speaker 5>in what capacity?</v>

4395
02:14:46.441 --> 02:14:49.850
<v Speaker 5>In every capacity a well,</v>

4396
02:14:49.980 --> 02:14:50.890
<v Speaker 5>in terms of like,</v>

4397
02:14:51.180 --> 02:14:52.340
<v Speaker 5>like right now what?</v>

4398
02:14:52.370 --> 02:14:52.561
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4399
02:14:52.561 --> 02:14:54.000
<v Speaker 5>how they make all the consumer goods?</v>

4400
02:14:54.130 --> 02:14:54.540
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4401
02:14:54.540 --> 02:14:56.340
<v Speaker 5>In manufacturing cars.</v>

4402
02:14:56.760 --> 02:14:57.700
<v Speaker 5>Imagine if you had.</v>

4403
02:14:58.050 --> 02:15:01.410
<v Speaker 5>Imagine if everybody knew what a three d printer like never.</v>

4404
02:15:01.420 --> 02:15:05.070
<v Speaker 5>I need to buy any like dollar stores spatulas you make one at home.</v>

4405
02:15:05.970 --> 02:15:06.631
<v Speaker 5>Then eventually,</v>

4406
02:15:06.631 --> 02:15:07.860
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if everyone will have on,</v>

4407
02:15:07.861 --> 02:15:12.240
<v Speaker 5>but eventually they're going to be so cheap that almost everyone's going to have</v>

4408
02:15:12.241 --> 02:15:12.720
<v Speaker 5>one.</v>

4409
02:15:12.720 --> 02:15:14.730
<v Speaker 5>So maybe you won't have a three d printer,</v>

4410
02:15:14.731 --> 02:15:15.564
<v Speaker 5>but your neighbor will.</v>

4411
02:15:15.600 --> 02:15:16.100
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

4412
02:15:16.100 --> 02:15:16.650
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

4413
02:15:16.650 --> 02:15:16.771
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

4414
02:15:16.771 --> 02:15:17.790
<v Speaker 5>can you make me a special though?</v>

4415
02:15:17.880 --> 02:15:18.270
<v Speaker 5>Just like,</v>

4416
02:15:18.270 --> 02:15:18.560
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4417
02:15:18.560 --> 02:15:20.430
<v Speaker 5>in the old days you'd ask for a cup of milk or something.</v>

4418
02:15:20.940 --> 02:15:21.660
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4419
02:15:21.660 --> 02:15:22.470
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

4420
02:15:22.470 --> 02:15:23.840
<v Speaker 5>So that's a special something.</v>

4421
02:15:24.300 --> 02:15:25.260
<v Speaker 5>What about in</v>

4422
02:15:25.350 --> 02:15:26.280
<v Speaker 4>terms of like,</v>

4423
02:15:26.281 --> 02:15:27.114
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4424
02:15:28.020 --> 02:15:28.230
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

4425
02:15:28.230 --> 02:15:30.510
<v Speaker 4>I think that drivers will be replaced.</v>

4426
02:15:30.511 --> 02:15:32.790
<v Speaker 4>I mean most of the drivers.</v>

4427
02:15:32.850 --> 02:15:33.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4428
02:15:33.570 --> 02:15:34.470
<v Speaker 4>Every everyday.</v>

4429
02:15:34.510 --> 02:15:35.610
<v Speaker 4>Almost every day I'm on the road.</v>

4430
02:15:35.611 --> 02:15:37.200
<v Speaker 4>I mean I drive pretty conservatively.</v>

4431
02:15:37.440 --> 02:15:41.700
<v Speaker 4>I drive with a decent length among the next car and it's always paid off in</v>

4432
02:15:41.701 --> 02:15:44.040
<v Speaker 4>terms of me getting through lights easier.</v>

4433
02:15:44.041 --> 02:15:46.840
<v Speaker 4>Being able to maneuver around car is easier.</v>

4434
02:15:46.841 --> 02:15:50.520
<v Speaker 4>Like writing a person's ass is bad many more ways than just,</v>

4435
02:15:50.780 --> 02:15:50.901
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4436
02:15:50.901 --> 02:15:54.780
<v Speaker 4>it's stupid as fuck in many more ways than just being a,</v>

4437
02:15:56.440 --> 02:15:58.680
<v Speaker 4>the opening yourself up to a car accident.</v>

4438
02:15:58.980 --> 02:16:01.650
<v Speaker 4>It's just so much more efficient to leave room.</v>

4439
02:16:01.651 --> 02:16:02.340
<v Speaker 4>But I mean,</v>

4440
02:16:02.340 --> 02:16:02.941
<v Speaker 4>well anyway,</v>

4441
02:16:02.941 --> 02:16:04.020
<v Speaker 4>and then when I saw that,</v>

4442
02:16:04.080 --> 02:16:04.680
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4443
02:16:04.680 --> 02:16:07.140
<v Speaker 4>computers have a,</v>

4444
02:16:07.770 --> 02:16:12.570
<v Speaker 4>have analyzed exactly what the most efficient traffic,</v>

4445
02:16:12.580 --> 02:16:15.360
<v Speaker 4>pat the most efficient traffic,</v>

4446
02:16:15.900 --> 02:16:20.640
<v Speaker 4>what the most efficient traffic flows would look like in the United States if</v>

4447
02:16:20.641 --> 02:16:22.740
<v Speaker 4>cars follows a certain pattern.</v>

4448
02:16:22.740 --> 02:16:26.760
<v Speaker 4>And it was typically the length that I leave and I'm thinking myself like,</v>

4449
02:16:26.761 --> 02:16:26.971
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4450
02:16:26.971 --> 02:16:27.210
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

4451
02:16:27.210 --> 02:16:29.530
<v Speaker 4>I mean people are always driving.</v>

4452
02:16:29.531 --> 02:16:30.910
<v Speaker 4>So anyway,</v>

4453
02:16:30.911 --> 02:16:31.990
<v Speaker 4>so what I'm thinking is like,</v>

4454
02:16:32.120 --> 02:16:36.370
<v Speaker 4>I pray to God every day that it maybe not commercial drivers,</v>

4455
02:16:36.371 --> 02:16:39.850
<v Speaker 4>but people just have more cars taken away from them.</v>

4456
02:16:40.080 --> 02:16:40.650
<v Speaker 4>I mean just,</v>

4457
02:16:40.650 --> 02:16:45.650
<v Speaker 4>it's because it's so inefficient because people lose hours and days just driving</v>

4458
02:16:47.290 --> 02:16:47.861
<v Speaker 4>cars.</v>

4459
02:16:47.861 --> 02:16:48.490
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4460
02:16:48.490 --> 02:16:49.330
<v Speaker 4>thank God,</v>

4461
02:16:49.420 --> 02:16:50.080
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4462
02:16:50.080 --> 02:16:54.820
<v Speaker 4>Elon musk is digging tunnels to help at some point,</v>

4463
02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:56.320
<v Speaker 4>alleviate traffic.</v>

4464
02:16:56.760 --> 02:16:57.593
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

4465
02:16:57.870 --> 02:16:58.390
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

4466
02:16:58.390 --> 02:16:58.930
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

4467
02:16:58.930 --> 02:17:00.940
<v Speaker 4>but I mean as far as truck drivers go,</v>

4468
02:17:00.941 --> 02:17:04.180
<v Speaker 4>like that's not really a good thing.</v>

4469
02:17:04.181 --> 02:17:04.511
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4470
02:17:04.511 --> 02:17:05.530
<v Speaker 4>truck drivers,</v>

4471
02:17:05.690 --> 02:17:06.120
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4472
02:17:06.120 --> 02:17:09.820
<v Speaker 4>I don't always understand how they're doing things.</v>

4473
02:17:09.821 --> 02:17:11.780
<v Speaker 4>I mean sometimes it seems like to be an assholes,</v>

4474
02:17:11.781 --> 02:17:12.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4475
02:17:12.040 --> 02:17:12.281
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4476
02:17:12.281 --> 02:17:13.300
<v Speaker 4>they're communicating,</v>

4477
02:17:13.301 --> 02:17:14.890
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to really know.</v>

4478
02:17:15.350 --> 02:17:16.030
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4479
02:17:16.030 --> 02:17:17.110
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

4480
02:17:17.111 --> 02:17:18.220
<v Speaker 4>to take their work away,</v>

4481
02:17:18.221 --> 02:17:19.150
<v Speaker 4>that'd be terrible.</v>

4482
02:17:19.151 --> 02:17:19.984
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's</v>

4483
02:17:21.880 --> 02:17:23.820
<v Speaker 4>either reminds me,</v>

4484
02:17:25.510 --> 02:17:26.210
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4485
02:17:26.210 --> 02:17:26.610
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4486
02:17:26.610 --> 02:17:28.160
<v Speaker 4>so yeah,</v>

4487
02:17:29.090 --> 02:17:30.790
<v Speaker 4>I just meant in what capacity.</v>

4488
02:17:30.791 --> 02:17:31.301
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

4489
02:17:31.301 --> 02:17:33.040
<v Speaker 4>Because like robots,</v>

4490
02:17:33.290 --> 02:17:33.540
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

4491
02:17:33.540 --> 02:17:35.620
<v Speaker 4>I've heard people say if you can keep that thought,</v>

4492
02:17:35.621 --> 02:17:36.730
<v Speaker 4>I've heard people say that</v>

4493
02:17:38.350 --> 02:17:38.930
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4494
02:17:38.930 --> 02:17:39.763
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4495
02:17:40.300 --> 02:17:42.250
<v Speaker 4>are the hockey stick,</v>

4496
02:17:42.320 --> 02:17:47.320
<v Speaker 4>is the hockey stick effect as it has been applied technology over the last</v>

4497
02:17:49.430 --> 02:17:50.940
<v Speaker 7>uh Huh.</v>

4498
02:17:51.570 --> 02:17:52.810
<v Speaker 4>Last 10 years or so.</v>

4499
02:17:54.040 --> 02:17:57.880
<v Speaker 4>Like with computers and everything is not going to resemble</v>

4500
02:18:01.140 --> 02:18:01.950
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

4501
02:18:01.950 --> 02:18:02.360
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

4502
02:18:02.360 --> 02:18:07.360
<v Speaker 4>like robots do not learn on the same way that the humans develop computer chips.</v>

4503
02:18:07.820 --> 02:18:10.010
<v Speaker 4>That's what I've heard technologists,</v>

4504
02:18:10.011 --> 02:18:12.580
<v Speaker 4>scientists say that it's,</v>

4505
02:18:12.620 --> 02:18:13.010
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

4506
02:18:13.010 --> 02:18:14.690
<v Speaker 4>you're not gonna have the same.</v>

4507
02:18:15.260 --> 02:18:15.591
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4508
02:18:15.591 --> 02:18:16.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4509
02:18:16.060 --> 02:18:19.040
<v Speaker 4>in 1990 year playing shit.</v>

4510
02:18:19.041 --> 02:18:19.290
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

4511
02:18:19.290 --> 02:18:20.123
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

4512
02:18:21.190 --> 02:18:21.491
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4513
02:18:21.491 --> 02:18:22.290
<v Speaker 3>with the,</v>

4514
02:18:22.290 --> 02:18:24.520
<v Speaker 3>with what I've heard from some people,</v>

4515
02:18:24.550 --> 02:18:25.383
<v Speaker 3>they say that like,</v>

4516
02:18:25.590 --> 02:18:25.930
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4517
02:18:25.930 --> 02:18:30.160
<v Speaker 3>events chair at some point the algorithms are going to be developing ways of</v>

4518
02:18:30.670 --> 02:18:34.240
<v Speaker 3>improving themselves without our knowledge or like in ways that we won't be able</v>

4519
02:18:34.241 --> 02:18:39.241
<v Speaker 3>to comprehend or lex faster than we're able to catch up in terms of our</v>

4520
02:18:39.341 --> 02:18:40.174
<v Speaker 3>comprehension.</v>

4521
02:18:40.540 --> 02:18:41.570
<v Speaker 3>So I'm not,</v>

4522
02:18:41.580 --> 02:18:42.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm not quite sure.</v>

4523
02:18:42.461 --> 02:18:43.181
<v Speaker 3>I think eventually,</v>

4524
02:18:43.181 --> 02:18:46.360
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately almost all trucking jobs are going to be automated.</v>

4525
02:18:46.650 --> 02:18:47.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4526
02:18:47.200 --> 02:18:50.770
<v Speaker 3>Which is like so many people are employed in that sector.</v>

4527
02:18:50.950 --> 02:18:51.251
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4528
02:18:51.251 --> 02:18:55.600
<v Speaker 4>But I don't necessarily think that's true fully because I.</v>

4529
02:18:55.690 --> 02:18:56.890
<v Speaker 4>because again,</v>

4530
02:18:57.280 --> 02:19:02.280
<v Speaker 4>like they're saying that robots are so bad at pattern recognition right now and</v>

4531
02:19:02.321 --> 02:19:04.670
<v Speaker 4>it's not this like the,</v>

4532
02:19:04.840 --> 02:19:09.840
<v Speaker 4>the scientists don't see it as this effect where,</v>

4533
02:19:10.270 --> 02:19:10.511
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

4534
02:19:10.511 --> 02:19:15.511
<v Speaker 4>we're suddenly going to know how to make them more efficient or better pattern</v>

4535
02:19:16.901 --> 02:19:17.950
<v Speaker 4>recognizers.</v>

4536
02:19:18.570 --> 02:19:21.730
<v Speaker 4>This is what I've heard that yeah,</v>

4537
02:19:21.731 --> 02:19:25.150
<v Speaker 4>the trucks will drive themselves up to a building,</v>

4538
02:19:25.151 --> 02:19:27.890
<v Speaker 4>but then somebody with the capacity with the UN,</v>

4539
02:19:28.460 --> 02:19:32.480
<v Speaker 4>with the skill set of backing a truck up to the loading dock is gonna have the</v>

4540
02:19:32.481 --> 02:19:36.380
<v Speaker 4>takeover because right now robots don't have that capacity because they don't</v>

4541
02:19:36.381 --> 02:19:38.990
<v Speaker 4>have that ability to do that effectively.</v>

4542
02:19:39.980 --> 02:19:41.180
<v Speaker 4>They're not able to</v>

4543
02:19:42.830 --> 02:19:45.230
<v Speaker 4>basically doc</v>

4544
02:19:46.760 --> 02:19:50.620
<v Speaker 5>with the traffic and so I think that's the thing that will eventually solve that</v>

4545
02:19:50.621 --> 02:19:50.921
<v Speaker 5>issue,</v>

4546
02:19:50.921 --> 02:19:52.970
<v Speaker 5>but I don't know.</v>

4547
02:19:52.980 --> 02:19:54.520
<v Speaker 5>I don't know enough about it to be honest.</v>

4548
02:19:54.600 --> 02:19:54.961
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4549
02:19:54.961 --> 02:19:57.030
<v Speaker 4>But I wonder if that'll leave in our lifetime.</v>

4550
02:19:57.031 --> 02:19:57.271
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4551
02:19:57.271 --> 02:19:58.710
<v Speaker 4>I don't necessarily know that that's.</v>

4552
02:19:58.890 --> 02:19:59.651
<v Speaker 4>I don't think we'll see.</v>

4553
02:19:59.651 --> 02:20:01.410
<v Speaker 4>We'll see that in our lifetime.</v>

4554
02:20:01.710 --> 02:20:02.450
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4555
02:20:02.450 --> 02:20:03.283
<v Speaker 5>may see,</v>

4556
02:20:03.320 --> 02:20:04.420
<v Speaker 5>I think on the highway.</v>

4557
02:20:05.490 --> 02:20:05.871
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4558
02:20:05.871 --> 02:20:07.210
<v Speaker 5>I think on the highways you'll start,</v>

4559
02:20:07.330 --> 02:20:09.170
<v Speaker 5>you'll start seeing like automatic trucks.</v>

4560
02:20:09.171 --> 02:20:09.971
<v Speaker 5>Do you remember that movie,</v>

4561
02:20:09.971 --> 02:20:10.804
<v Speaker 5>Logan?</v>

4562
02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:13.480
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4563
02:20:13.480 --> 02:20:14.600
<v Speaker 5>that's the wolverine movie.</v>

4564
02:20:14.601 --> 02:20:17.760
<v Speaker 5>It'll last for the last war room.</v>

4565
02:20:17.890 --> 02:20:18.723
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

4566
02:20:18.730 --> 02:20:21.730
<v Speaker 5>Well there's like this in the future and they're like,</v>

4567
02:20:21.940 --> 02:20:22.773
<v Speaker 5>I made a comment.</v>

4568
02:20:22.930 --> 02:20:23.021
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

4569
02:20:23.021 --> 02:20:25.330
<v Speaker 5>I hate these auto trucks because they're just driving around like not.</v>

4570
02:20:25.420 --> 02:20:26.253
<v Speaker 5>They don't really care.</v>

4571
02:20:26.320 --> 02:20:28.120
<v Speaker 5>I don't pay enough attention to the road.</v>

4572
02:20:28.121 --> 02:20:32.110
<v Speaker 5>I guess they're just doing the transportation job and they have no cab.</v>

4573
02:20:32.111 --> 02:20:32.944
<v Speaker 5>It's just like a,</v>

4574
02:20:33.130 --> 02:20:34.750
<v Speaker 5>almost like a big box on wheels.</v>

4575
02:20:35.220 --> 02:20:35.640
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4576
02:20:35.640 --> 02:20:36.190
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4577
02:20:36.190 --> 02:20:36.971
<v Speaker 5>but I saw that.</v>

4578
02:20:36.971 --> 02:20:37.241
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

4579
02:20:37.241 --> 02:20:37.391
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

4580
02:20:37.391 --> 02:20:38.800
<v Speaker 5>I guess I saw that and I was like,</v>

4581
02:20:38.801 --> 02:20:39.071
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

4582
02:20:39.071 --> 02:20:44.071
<v Speaker 5>well I guess that looks pretty real as stick when that could happen really soon,</v>

4583
02:20:44.500 --> 02:20:45.101
<v Speaker 5>unfortunately.</v>

4584
02:20:45.101 --> 02:20:45.280
<v Speaker 5>Because,</v>

4585
02:20:45.280 --> 02:20:46.600
<v Speaker 5>I mean my brother,</v>

4586
02:20:46.650 --> 02:20:47.790
<v Speaker 5>a driver and a,</v>

4587
02:20:48.240 --> 02:20:50.710
<v Speaker 5>well you don't want to see them at work,</v>

4588
02:20:50.711 --> 02:20:51.401
<v Speaker 5>but will,</v>

4589
02:20:51.401 --> 02:20:53.530
<v Speaker 5>you may still have it.</v>

4590
02:20:53.980 --> 02:20:56.410
<v Speaker 4>You may still see people travel with the truck,</v>

4591
02:20:56.680 --> 02:21:01.680
<v Speaker 4>but they may just be maintainers rather than drivers and they may be emergency</v>

4592
02:21:01.721 --> 02:21:02.461
<v Speaker 4>drivers too.</v>

4593
02:21:02.461 --> 02:21:03.294
<v Speaker 4>I mean</v>

4594
02:21:04.420 --> 02:21:08.150
<v Speaker 5>because one guy or one guy's in charge of driving 10 inch,</v>

4595
02:21:08.190 --> 02:21:10.490
<v Speaker 5>like making sure 10 trucks make it across.</v>

4596
02:21:10.491 --> 02:21:10.731
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

4597
02:21:10.731 --> 02:21:12.530
<v Speaker 5>Instead of just having one eye,</v>

4598
02:21:12.600 --> 02:21:14.000
<v Speaker 5>I can see that happening for sure.</v>

4599
02:21:14.510 --> 02:21:15.770
<v Speaker 5>I think it will be a gradual thing.</v>

4600
02:21:18.110 --> 02:21:22.970
<v Speaker 5>I didn't mean that we won't see trucks automated on the road.</v>

4601
02:21:22.971 --> 02:21:23.270
<v Speaker 5>I met,</v>

4602
02:21:23.270 --> 02:21:23.840
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

4603
02:21:23.840 --> 02:21:25.490
<v Speaker 5>we won't see widespread,</v>

4604
02:21:26.100 --> 02:21:26.933
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4605
02:21:27.680 --> 02:21:29.830
<v Speaker 5>enough for automation is already there.</v>

4606
02:21:29.850 --> 02:21:30.810
<v Speaker 4>Pretty much widespread.</v>

4607
02:21:30.960 --> 02:21:35.080
<v Speaker 4>Like there is one area that I don't agree with a c,</v>

4608
02:21:35.140 --> 02:21:40.140
<v Speaker 4>so I grew up in the Chicago land area and Mcdonald's headquarters in Oakbrook,</v>

4609
02:21:40.200 --> 02:21:43.530
<v Speaker 4>Illinois and in Bolingbrook,</v>

4610
02:21:43.531 --> 02:21:43.901
<v Speaker 4>Illinois,</v>

4611
02:21:43.901 --> 02:21:45.270
<v Speaker 4>a town over from where I lived.</v>

4612
02:21:45.920 --> 02:21:46.753
<v Speaker 6>I'm not,</v>

4613
02:21:49.090 --> 02:21:50.740
<v Speaker 4>I don't know about this restaurant specifically,</v>

4614
02:21:50.741 --> 02:21:51.380
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

4615
02:21:51.380 --> 02:21:52.213
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

4616
02:21:52.370 --> 02:21:53.203
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

4617
02:21:53.590 --> 02:21:54.423
<v Speaker 6>they would,</v>

4618
02:21:54.590 --> 02:21:55.730
<v Speaker 4>it got to a point.</v>

4619
02:21:55.790 --> 02:21:58.940
<v Speaker 4>It was the same Mcdonald's for years and years and years.</v>

4620
02:21:58.941 --> 02:22:02.030
<v Speaker 4>And then one day they decided to make it one of the flagship restaurants,</v>

4621
02:22:02.031 --> 02:22:06.950
<v Speaker 4>meaning that they will tear that restaurant down sometimes.</v>

4622
02:22:08.040 --> 02:22:08.873
<v Speaker 6>I think</v>

4623
02:22:09.590 --> 02:22:12.020
<v Speaker 4>one time they did it six months apart,</v>

4624
02:22:12.021 --> 02:22:13.190
<v Speaker 4>so they tore it down,</v>

4625
02:22:13.760 --> 02:22:14.910
<v Speaker 4>not for nothing.</v>

4626
02:22:14.990 --> 02:22:15.860
<v Speaker 4>They didn't get the whole,</v>

4627
02:22:15.890 --> 02:22:17.840
<v Speaker 4>they didn't demolish the building,</v>

4628
02:22:17.841 --> 02:22:20.630
<v Speaker 4>but they gutted almost everything in the inside the exterior.</v>

4629
02:22:21.290 --> 02:22:23.960
<v Speaker 4>And then six months later they did it again and all of a sudden you've got</v>

4630
02:22:23.961 --> 02:22:25.290
<v Speaker 4>kiosks where you just,</v>

4631
02:22:25.440 --> 02:22:27.030
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to go up to a person.</v>

4632
02:22:27.330 --> 02:22:29.430
<v Speaker 4>They had automatic cheeseburger makers.</v>

4633
02:22:29.790 --> 02:22:30.211
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4634
02:22:30.211 --> 02:22:30.710
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

4635
02:22:30.710 --> 02:22:30.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4636
02:22:30.930 --> 02:22:33.630
<v Speaker 4>there are already automating things and I heard someone say that you can't do</v>

4637
02:22:33.631 --> 02:22:35.190
<v Speaker 4>that and it's already been done.</v>

4638
02:22:35.191 --> 02:22:37.230
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's already a.</v>

4639
02:22:38.700 --> 02:22:39.640
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

4640
02:22:39.660 --> 02:22:42.180
<v Speaker 4>to the extent that I think you can phase all the people out,</v>

4641
02:22:42.280 --> 02:22:43.800
<v Speaker 4>I don't know enough about that,</v>

4642
02:22:43.801 --> 02:22:45.930
<v Speaker 4>but I just don't think we'll see it,</v>

4643
02:22:45.990 --> 02:22:46.680
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4644
02:22:46.680 --> 02:22:47.970
<v Speaker 4>as widespread.</v>

4645
02:22:49.670 --> 02:22:50.990
<v Speaker 4>And then if there's other problems,</v>

4646
02:22:50.991 --> 02:22:51.190
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4647
02:22:51.190 --> 02:22:51.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4648
02:22:51.840 --> 02:22:53.240
<v Speaker 4>you start putting people out of work,</v>

4649
02:22:54.300 --> 02:22:59.300
<v Speaker 5>will that have a negative effect on technology and progress?</v>

4650
02:23:00.091 --> 02:23:02.310
<v Speaker 5>And I don't know,</v>

4651
02:23:02.490 --> 02:23:04.740
<v Speaker 5>there's some crazy like a for sure.</v>

4652
02:23:07.760 --> 02:23:08.593
<v Speaker 5>That's nice.</v>

4653
02:23:08.900 --> 02:23:10.850
<v Speaker 4>Maybe like the first area they'll uh,</v>

4654
02:23:12.620 --> 02:23:13.330
<v Speaker 7>the</v>

4655
02:23:13.330 --> 02:23:16.900
<v Speaker 4>really get down as in warfare that wave.</v>

4656
02:23:16.960 --> 02:23:18.910
<v Speaker 4>So when people do get out of work,</v>

4657
02:23:19.150 --> 02:23:19.421
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4658
02:23:19.421 --> 02:23:20.200
<v Speaker 4>you're not,</v>

4659
02:23:20.200 --> 02:23:21.610
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to put boots on the ground.</v>

4660
02:23:21.611 --> 02:23:23.500
<v Speaker 4>You got robots that are policing people.</v>

4661
02:23:23.620 --> 02:23:24.453
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

4662
02:23:26.600 --> 02:23:27.780
<v Speaker 5>it's a</v>

4663
02:23:29.390 --> 02:23:30.550
<v Speaker 5>go full skynet,</v>

4664
02:23:30.551 --> 02:23:30.951
<v Speaker 5>I hope.</v>

4665
02:23:30.951 --> 02:23:33.110
<v Speaker 5>I don't hope they keep their shit together.</v>

4666
02:23:33.620 --> 02:23:34.150
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

4667
02:23:34.150 --> 02:23:36.540
<v Speaker 5>another one thing I'm seeing yet,</v>

4668
02:23:37.250 --> 02:23:40.400
<v Speaker 5>that starship troopers book that we're talking about earlier,</v>

4669
02:23:41.010 --> 02:23:43.670
<v Speaker 5>I'm part of the history is that they,</v>

4670
02:23:43.730 --> 02:23:44.563
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4671
02:23:45.590 --> 02:23:46.423
<v Speaker 5>earth is like,</v>

4672
02:23:47.120 --> 02:23:50.290
<v Speaker 5>there's this big war between the West and China because trying to get,</v>

4673
02:23:50.540 --> 02:23:51.890
<v Speaker 5>get so powerful economically.</v>

4674
02:23:52.030 --> 02:23:53.180
<v Speaker 5>And this was written in the sixties.</v>

4675
02:23:53.181 --> 02:23:54.800
<v Speaker 5>So this guy was pretty oppression.</v>

4676
02:23:55.470 --> 02:23:56.060
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

4677
02:23:56.060 --> 02:23:56.893
<v Speaker 7>but,</v>

4678
02:23:57.570 --> 02:23:58.070
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4679
02:23:58.070 --> 02:23:59.600
<v Speaker 5>so for anyone who doesn't know,</v>

4680
02:23:59.650 --> 02:24:01.670
<v Speaker 5>a starship troopers is written by Robert Heinlein.</v>

4681
02:24:02.120 --> 02:24:04.300
<v Speaker 5>I highly recommend reading the book and Washington movie.</v>

4682
02:24:04.760 --> 02:24:05.121
<v Speaker 5>But anyway,</v>

4683
02:24:05.121 --> 02:24:07.540
<v Speaker 5>so there was a war with China and uh,</v>

4684
02:24:08.210 --> 02:24:10.850
<v Speaker 5>I think they don't really go into details,</v>

4685
02:24:10.880 --> 02:24:13.150
<v Speaker 5>but it sounds like the west won that war,</v>

4686
02:24:14.420 --> 02:24:16.670
<v Speaker 5>but it was against this totalitarian.</v>

4687
02:24:16.720 --> 02:24:19.220
<v Speaker 5>I'm sort of robot sort of ideal.</v>

4688
02:24:19.640 --> 02:24:22.070
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorta like how China is doing now with their,</v>

4689
02:24:22.071 --> 02:24:22.904
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4690
02:24:23.330 --> 02:24:27.090
<v Speaker 5>their morality system with like the points black,</v>

4691
02:24:27.370 --> 02:24:28.610
<v Speaker 5>like the Black Mirror episode,</v>

4692
02:24:30.080 --> 02:24:31.910
<v Speaker 5>which is kind of fucked up because that's like,</v>

4693
02:24:32.050 --> 02:24:34.630
<v Speaker 5>that's 1984 is something that you could kind of.</v>

4694
02:24:34.700 --> 02:24:36.140
<v Speaker 5>Everyone was guessing I was going to happen,</v>

4695
02:24:36.141 --> 02:24:38.120
<v Speaker 5>but this is almost like brave new world style.</v>

4696
02:24:38.870 --> 02:24:41.510
<v Speaker 5>Like in China you can go around talking about tenement square,</v>

4697
02:24:41.511 --> 02:24:44.870
<v Speaker 5>but it's just only if you start like doing big speeches and in influencing</v>

4698
02:24:44.871 --> 02:24:49.871
<v Speaker 5>people then it's a problem which is not completely totalitarian,</v>

4699
02:24:50.001 --> 02:24:52.100
<v Speaker 5>but it's just to tell Terry enough to keep things,</v>

4700
02:24:52.330 --> 02:24:52.670
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4701
02:24:52.670 --> 02:24:53.503
<v Speaker 5>the way it is.</v>

4702
02:24:53.710 --> 02:24:53.961
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4703
02:24:53.961 --> 02:24:58.961
<v Speaker 5>And when you mentioned brave new worlds board that know people accept and</v>

4704
02:24:59.980 --> 02:25:00.813
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

4705
02:25:01.240 --> 02:25:02.320
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

4706
02:25:02.660 --> 02:25:05.840
<v Speaker 5>accepted and well too preoccupied.</v>

4707
02:25:05.841 --> 02:25:06.171
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4708
02:25:06.171 --> 02:25:08.330
<v Speaker 5>And there will be welcoming the uh,</v>

4709
02:25:09.220 --> 02:25:10.670
<v Speaker 5>the social credit system.</v>

4710
02:25:10.970 --> 02:25:11.480
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4711
02:25:11.480 --> 02:25:12.950
<v Speaker 5>I don't know that everybody does in China,</v>

4712
02:25:12.951 --> 02:25:17.170
<v Speaker 5>but I'm sure there's quite a bit of people don't know I'm talking about.</v>

4713
02:25:17.180 --> 02:25:18.410
<v Speaker 5>I don't really know anything about it.</v>

4714
02:25:18.520 --> 02:25:23.520
<v Speaker 5>I just know that it sounds scary and to that,</v>

4715
02:25:24.310 --> 02:25:24.611
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4716
02:25:24.611 --> 02:25:25.660
<v Speaker 5>you kinda got it here.</v>

4717
02:25:25.661 --> 02:25:26.080
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4718
02:25:26.080 --> 02:25:28.060
<v Speaker 5>Alex Jones can't say the shit that he says.</v>

4719
02:25:28.061 --> 02:25:29.890
<v Speaker 5>So are guns gone off Patrion?</v>

4720
02:25:30.240 --> 02:25:34.270
<v Speaker 5>I mean we don't know really how far this goes as far as I understand.</v>

4721
02:25:35.250 --> 02:25:39.220
<v Speaker 5>I think as long as there's free people willing to stand up and say things,</v>

4722
02:25:39.221 --> 02:25:40.054
<v Speaker 5>I think we're probably,</v>

4723
02:25:40.130 --> 02:25:41.800
<v Speaker 5>we're going to be okay for a long time,</v>

4724
02:25:42.130 --> 02:25:45.640
<v Speaker 5>but we definitely have to like keep raising the issue of being able to say</v>

4725
02:25:45.641 --> 02:25:47.840
<v Speaker 5>things because uh,</v>

4726
02:25:48.020 --> 02:25:48.550
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

4727
02:25:48.550 --> 02:25:50.800
<v Speaker 5>I find myself censoring myself on reddit because I'll,</v>

4728
02:25:50.950 --> 02:25:51.400
<v Speaker 5>I'll,</v>

4729
02:25:51.400 --> 02:25:52.300
<v Speaker 5>if you try to pose,</v>

4730
02:25:52.301 --> 02:25:54.550
<v Speaker 5>if you're not a left wing person,</v>

4731
02:25:54.551 --> 02:25:54.700
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4732
02:25:54.700 --> 02:25:55.040
<v Speaker 5>Because right.</v>

4733
02:25:55.040 --> 02:26:00.040
<v Speaker 5>It's like 10 to one left wing and you go on like our politics or like one of the</v>

4734
02:26:00.071 --> 02:26:01.630
<v Speaker 5>main world news or something like that.</v>

4735
02:26:01.930 --> 02:26:04.960
<v Speaker 5>And you say anything that's outside of the left is orthodoxy.</v>

4736
02:26:05.260 --> 02:26:08.000
<v Speaker 5>You're just downward you downloaded out of existence like.</v>

4737
02:26:08.590 --> 02:26:13.590
<v Speaker 5>So you Kinda have a reluctance to say those things then because the more you</v>

4738
02:26:13.691 --> 02:26:15.240
<v Speaker 5>downloaded it down with a lot,</v>

4739
02:26:15.280 --> 02:26:17.740
<v Speaker 5>eventually you just can't post at all.</v>

4740
02:26:17.980 --> 02:26:18.400
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4741
02:26:18.400 --> 02:26:19.300
<v Speaker 5>So it,</v>

4742
02:26:19.600 --> 02:26:23.830
<v Speaker 5>it creates like this fucked up system or things kind of need to be said like,</v>

4743
02:26:23.831 --> 02:26:25.000
<v Speaker 5>you know this like Oh,</v>

4744
02:26:25.001 --> 02:26:29.610
<v Speaker 5>trump's going to be indicted because of this guy said something disguised</v>

4745
02:26:29.650 --> 02:26:34.650
<v Speaker 5>cousin's barber brother said something and trump's definitely gonna get caught</v>

4746
02:26:35.621 --> 02:26:36.041
<v Speaker 5>this time.</v>

4747
02:26:36.041 --> 02:26:36.191
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

4748
02:26:36.191 --> 02:26:37.450
<v Speaker 5>And it's been going on for two years.</v>

4749
02:26:38.020 --> 02:26:42.820
<v Speaker 5>Every single posts like that gets like 30,000 or more votes and it's like it's</v>

4750
02:26:42.821 --> 02:26:44.780
<v Speaker 5>complete garbage because like it's Oh,</v>

4751
02:26:44.850 --> 02:26:45.431
<v Speaker 5>maybe it isn't,</v>

4752
02:26:45.431 --> 02:26:47.380
<v Speaker 5>but it looks every single time it's the wrong.</v>

4753
02:26:47.380 --> 02:26:47.621
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

4754
02:26:47.621 --> 02:26:51.190
<v Speaker 5>So I've basically filtered it out in my mind is pure garbage,</v>

4755
02:26:51.340 --> 02:26:51.851
<v Speaker 5>but it's still good,</v>

4756
02:26:51.851 --> 02:26:52.690
<v Speaker 5>like $30,000.</v>

4757
02:26:53.170 --> 02:26:55.180
<v Speaker 5>But that's because it meets the leftist orthodoxy.</v>

4758
02:26:55.450 --> 02:26:56.050
<v Speaker 5>They've actually,</v>

4759
02:26:56.050 --> 02:26:56.410
<v Speaker 5>they're like,</v>

4760
02:26:56.410 --> 02:26:58.090
<v Speaker 5>well this maybe it's exactly how I think.</v>

4761
02:26:58.091 --> 02:26:59.330
<v Speaker 5>So I'm an upload it.</v>

4762
02:26:59.980 --> 02:27:00.810
<v Speaker 5>But if you make,</v>

4763
02:27:00.810 --> 02:27:02.230
<v Speaker 5>if you'd comment on there like,</v>

4764
02:27:02.380 --> 02:27:03.101
<v Speaker 5>come on guys.</v>

4765
02:27:03.101 --> 02:27:07.000
<v Speaker 5>Like really this is like the 400th fucking article you've uploaded to 30,000</v>

4766
02:27:07.001 --> 02:27:10.210
<v Speaker 5>votes and it's never worked out to be what it says.</v>

4767
02:27:10.690 --> 02:27:12.240
<v Speaker 5>And you just get down with it out of,</v>

4768
02:27:12.370 --> 02:27:13.990
<v Speaker 5>out of the thread basically.</v>

4769
02:27:13.991 --> 02:27:16.870
<v Speaker 5>Like you'd be right at the bottom of my minus 900 downloads,</v>

4770
02:27:16.871 --> 02:27:17.830
<v Speaker 5>which is like crazy.</v>

4771
02:27:18.430 --> 02:27:18.970
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4772
02:27:18.970 --> 02:27:22.000
<v Speaker 5>but it just sad because you can't have an honest conversation.</v>

4773
02:27:22.001 --> 02:27:25.450
<v Speaker 5>You can have a genuine conversation with anybody from the left right now.</v>

4774
02:27:26.800 --> 02:27:27.700
<v Speaker 5>Very few people.</v>

4775
02:27:29.640 --> 02:27:31.150
<v Speaker 5>So I just got to say,</v>

4776
02:27:31.151 --> 02:27:32.890
<v Speaker 5>it makes me think about the essay or the,</v>

4777
02:27:32.891 --> 02:27:33.724
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4778
02:27:33.880 --> 02:27:36.310
<v Speaker 5>what you had wrote in red earlier about,</v>

4779
02:27:36.311 --> 02:27:36.940
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4780
02:27:36.940 --> 02:27:41.940
<v Speaker 5>how do you talk to people who are so ingrained in their own biases or like he</v>

4781
02:27:43.001 --> 02:27:43.290
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>

4782
02:27:43.290 --> 02:27:44.123
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4783
02:27:44.260 --> 02:27:45.490
<v Speaker 5>their own orthodoxy,</v>

4784
02:27:46.200 --> 02:27:47.033
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

4785
02:27:48.840 --> 02:27:49.651
<v Speaker 5>if I'm using that.</v>

4786
02:27:49.651 --> 02:27:50.484
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

4787
02:27:50.630 --> 02:27:50.820
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4788
02:27:50.820 --> 02:27:51.653
<v Speaker 5>that's fine.</v>

4789
02:27:52.860 --> 02:27:53.131
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4790
02:27:53.131 --> 02:27:53.700
<v Speaker 5>How do you,</v>

4791
02:27:53.700 --> 02:27:54.900
<v Speaker 5>how do you get through to people?</v>

4792
02:27:54.910 --> 02:27:57.540
<v Speaker 5>Like how do you get through people that are at Peterson says they're</v>

4793
02:27:57.541 --> 02:27:58.710
<v Speaker 5>ideologically possessed,</v>

4794
02:27:58.711 --> 02:28:02.610
<v Speaker 5>which I think is a really good way to put it because that's really what it is.</v>

4795
02:28:02.611 --> 02:28:04.080
<v Speaker 5>I remember kind of being,</v>

4796
02:28:04.380 --> 02:28:07.380
<v Speaker 5>I'd never really don't think I was ever really ideologically possessed,</v>

4797
02:28:07.770 --> 02:28:12.770
<v Speaker 5>but I remember definitely pushing the left sort of leftist agenda because I</v>

4798
02:28:13.291 --> 02:28:14.430
<v Speaker 5>really thought it was like,</v>

4799
02:28:15.090 --> 02:28:15.301
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4800
02:28:15.301 --> 02:28:16.200
<v Speaker 5>I thought it was a good thing.</v>

4801
02:28:16.201 --> 02:28:16.430
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4802
02:28:16.430 --> 02:28:20.550
<v Speaker 5>you're helping people by taking rich bastards money and given it to the four</v>

4803
02:28:20.551 --> 02:28:20.851
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

4804
02:28:20.851 --> 02:28:21.050
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4805
02:28:21.050 --> 02:28:21.883
<v Speaker 5>Like Robin Hood,</v>

4806
02:28:21.950 --> 02:28:23.570
<v Speaker 5>Robin Hood is always seen as a good guy.</v>

4807
02:28:24.100 --> 02:28:24.920
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

4808
02:28:24.920 --> 02:28:27.140
<v Speaker 5>but I really thought about it for awhile.</v>

4809
02:28:27.170 --> 02:28:27.441
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

4810
02:28:27.441 --> 02:28:28.220
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

4811
02:28:28.220 --> 02:28:32.090
<v Speaker 5>what really matters is that we make life as good as possible for the most amount</v>

4812
02:28:32.091 --> 02:28:36.560
<v Speaker 5>of people possible and the system that's done that is capitalism.</v>

4813
02:28:37.040 --> 02:28:39.920
<v Speaker 5>And if we are going to suck it up that there's some rich guys and there's some</v>

4814
02:28:39.921 --> 02:28:40.754
<v Speaker 5>poor guy's,</v>

4815
02:28:41.090 --> 02:28:43.130
<v Speaker 5>then it's all going to be better in the end.</v>

4816
02:28:43.940 --> 02:28:47.180
<v Speaker 5>But there's just this resentment people have just to have it now.</v>

4817
02:28:47.300 --> 02:28:47.720
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4818
02:28:47.720 --> 02:28:48.370
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

4819
02:28:48.370 --> 02:28:51.890
<v Speaker 5>they would kind of cut off their nose to spite your face.</v>

4820
02:28:52.810 --> 02:28:53.643
<v Speaker 9>Hmm.</v>

4821
02:28:55.140 --> 02:28:57.480
<v Speaker 5>So getting back to China real quick,</v>

4822
02:28:57.990 --> 02:28:58.823
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4823
02:28:59.850 --> 02:29:00.940
<v Speaker 5>we're exactly where we,</v>

4824
02:29:01.140 --> 02:29:03.240
<v Speaker 5>you were talking about highlands book in the uh.</v>

4825
02:29:03.810 --> 02:29:04.310
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

4826
02:29:04.310 --> 02:29:04.650
<v Speaker 5>So yeah,</v>

4827
02:29:04.650 --> 02:29:08.390
<v Speaker 5>so there's like a battle ideological battle between like authoritarian</v>

4828
02:29:08.430 --> 02:29:10.140
<v Speaker 5>collectivism and uh,</v>

4829
02:29:10.800 --> 02:29:15.800
<v Speaker 5>I guess the starship troopers version of liberalism as Sargon this,</v>

4830
02:29:16.790 --> 02:29:18.620
<v Speaker 9>I'm a</v>

4831
02:29:19.880 --> 02:29:20.570
<v Speaker 5>show,</v>

4832
02:29:20.570 --> 02:29:21.403
<v Speaker 5>or what do you call it?</v>

4833
02:29:22.250 --> 02:29:23.630
<v Speaker 5>It's this little video he wrote,</v>

4834
02:29:23.631 --> 02:29:25.250
<v Speaker 5>he did about starship troopers.</v>

4835
02:29:25.760 --> 02:29:27.980
<v Speaker 5>It's like the Jordan Peterson a utopia.</v>

4836
02:29:29.810 --> 02:29:30.191
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

4837
02:29:30.191 --> 02:29:30.590
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

4838
02:29:30.590 --> 02:29:30.890
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

4839
02:29:30.890 --> 02:29:31.290
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

4840
02:29:31.290 --> 02:29:32.123
<v Speaker 5>I mentioned,</v>

4841
02:29:32.590 --> 02:29:32.870
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4842
02:29:32.870 --> 02:29:33.640
<v Speaker 5>this is really a,</v>

4843
02:29:33.640 --> 02:29:34.473
<v Speaker 5>a Peterson Ism.</v>

4844
02:29:35.790 --> 02:29:36.540
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4845
02:29:36.540 --> 02:29:36.820
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

4846
02:29:36.820 --> 02:29:37.170
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

4847
02:29:37.170 --> 02:29:37.670
<v Speaker 5>and the,</v>

4848
02:29:37.670 --> 02:29:39.680
<v Speaker 5>the counter so happens the,</v>

4849
02:29:39.681 --> 02:29:40.401
<v Speaker 5>the feet China,</v>

4850
02:29:40.401 --> 02:29:40.521
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4851
02:29:40.521 --> 02:29:42.500
<v Speaker 5>So the human collective wisdom is gone,</v>

4852
02:29:42.501 --> 02:29:43.760
<v Speaker 5>but then when they come across the,</v>

4853
02:29:43.761 --> 02:29:48.761
<v Speaker 5>enact a Arachnids they are collectivists like the way they think is the,</v>

4854
02:29:51.680 --> 02:29:53.690
<v Speaker 5>there's no difference in the individual and the whole.</v>

4855
02:29:53.691 --> 02:29:56.330
<v Speaker 5>So they don't care if they lose the individuals.</v>

4856
02:29:56.331 --> 02:29:56.841
<v Speaker 5>Nobody be like,</v>

4857
02:29:56.841 --> 02:29:58.010
<v Speaker 5>as a whole still exists.</v>

4858
02:29:58.480 --> 02:29:59.313
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4859
02:30:00.200 --> 02:30:01.610
<v Speaker 5>but humans aren't like that at all,</v>

4860
02:30:01.611 --> 02:30:05.000
<v Speaker 5>like they're way more individual.</v>

4861
02:30:05.600 --> 02:30:08.870
<v Speaker 5>So when bugs destroy the entire planet of humans,</v>

4862
02:30:08.871 --> 02:30:09.704
<v Speaker 5>just like whatever,</v>

4863
02:30:09.750 --> 02:30:13.400
<v Speaker 5>it's like killing one bug them and they don't care about the one bug.</v>

4864
02:30:13.401 --> 02:30:18.020
<v Speaker 5>So why would they care about killing 8 million individuals or however millions</v>

4865
02:30:18.021 --> 02:30:21.400
<v Speaker 5>of individuals because they just think about themselves as the collective,</v>

4866
02:30:21.420 --> 02:30:22.040
<v Speaker 5>as long as,</v>

4867
02:30:22.040 --> 02:30:23.410
<v Speaker 5>as long as the collective survives,</v>

4868
02:30:23.411 --> 02:30:24.244
<v Speaker 5>they don't care.</v>

4869
02:30:24.480 --> 02:30:25.130
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4870
02:30:25.130 --> 02:30:27.170
<v Speaker 5>so there's like that contrast between,</v>

4871
02:30:27.850 --> 02:30:28.683
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4872
02:30:28.730 --> 02:30:33.210
<v Speaker 5>so that's the weird thing with the Russos and Marxist and</v>

4873
02:30:34.790 --> 02:30:38.000
<v Speaker 5>communist ideals of the collective will,</v>

4874
02:30:38.880 --> 02:30:39.713
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4875
02:30:40.070 --> 02:30:44.840
<v Speaker 5>Russo goes into this idea that if you're a person that kills another person,</v>

4876
02:30:44.841 --> 02:30:49.550
<v Speaker 5>if you kill an individualist and collectivist because you're working,</v>

4877
02:30:50.240 --> 02:30:51.073
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4878
02:30:51.470 --> 02:30:55.130
<v Speaker 5>in favor of the collective goal or collective will he called it,</v>

4879
02:30:55.490 --> 02:30:56.323
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4880
02:30:57.200 --> 02:31:00.050
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't matter that you killed the person because the individual doesn't</v>

4881
02:31:00.051 --> 02:31:00.740
<v Speaker 5>matter.</v>

4882
02:31:00.740 --> 02:31:03.690
<v Speaker 5>And I just think that's kind of disturbing because I mean,</v>

4883
02:31:03.700 --> 02:31:04.340
<v Speaker 5>if you apply,</v>

4884
02:31:04.340 --> 02:31:05.630
<v Speaker 5>it sounds all good in theory,</v>

4885
02:31:05.631 --> 02:31:06.890
<v Speaker 5>but if you apply that in real life,</v>

4886
02:31:06.920 --> 02:31:09.170
<v Speaker 5>like you could kill anybody,</v>

4887
02:31:09.230 --> 02:31:09.501
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4888
02:31:09.501 --> 02:31:11.870
<v Speaker 5>that you could justify it for that reason.</v>

4889
02:31:12.560 --> 02:31:14.780
<v Speaker 5>And I think most people,</v>

4890
02:31:14.781 --> 02:31:15.280
<v Speaker 5>if they,</v>

4891
02:31:15.280 --> 02:31:16.640
<v Speaker 5>I think most people look at the,</v>

4892
02:31:17.060 --> 02:31:19.440
<v Speaker 5>sort of like the fluffy parts of communism and they think,</v>

4893
02:31:19.441 --> 02:31:19.711
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

4894
02:31:19.711 --> 02:31:19.980
<v Speaker 5>it's not</v>

4895
02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:20.760
<v Speaker 3>so bad,</v>

4896
02:31:20.760 --> 02:31:23.310
<v Speaker 3>but when you really dig down to what it leads to,</v>

4897
02:31:23.880 --> 02:31:24.660
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4898
02:31:24.660 --> 02:31:26.730
<v Speaker 3>if people are actually bothered to look at it,</v>

4899
02:31:26.731 --> 02:31:27.840
<v Speaker 3>which I don't think most do,</v>

4900
02:31:28.280 --> 02:31:28.600
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4901
02:31:28.600 --> 02:31:29.281
<v Speaker 3>they would see that.</v>

4902
02:31:29.281 --> 02:31:30.600
<v Speaker 3>It's like disgusting.</v>

4903
02:31:31.230 --> 02:31:31.620
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4904
02:31:31.620 --> 02:31:33.030
<v Speaker 3>it's worse than baby killers.</v>

4905
02:31:34.770 --> 02:31:35.250
<v Speaker 3>That's why.</v>

4906
02:31:35.250 --> 02:31:36.420
<v Speaker 3>That's why they get the helicopter.</v>

4907
02:31:39.820 --> 02:31:40.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4908
02:31:40.170 --> 02:31:41.003
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4909
02:31:44.640 --> 02:31:45.473
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

4910
02:31:45.720 --> 02:31:46.231
<v Speaker 3>I just saw,</v>

4911
02:31:46.231 --> 02:31:47.920
<v Speaker 3>I just read an article on</v>

4912
02:31:48.240 --> 02:31:49.780
<v Speaker 1>dredge recently about a,</v>

4913
02:31:50.630 --> 02:31:50.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4914
02:31:50.970 --> 02:31:52.800
<v Speaker 1>serial killings,</v>

4915
02:31:52.830 --> 02:31:56.520
<v Speaker 1>a possible serial killing sell in the states.</v>

4916
02:31:57.180 --> 02:31:58.013
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4917
02:31:58.060 --> 02:31:59.910
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

4918
02:31:59.940 --> 02:32:00.090
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4919
02:32:00.090 --> 02:32:00.361
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4920
02:32:00.361 --> 02:32:01.194
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

4921
02:32:02.220 --> 02:32:03.420
<v Speaker 1>I had never heard of it,</v>

4922
02:32:03.421 --> 02:32:03.710
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

4923
02:32:03.710 --> 02:32:03.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4924
02:32:03.930 --> 02:32:08.040
<v Speaker 1>they were this group basically where they were finding these,</v>

4925
02:32:08.041 --> 02:32:08.874
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4926
02:32:09.060 --> 02:32:13.700
<v Speaker 1>what they thought were suicide or possibly suicides are they,</v>

4927
02:32:13.780 --> 02:32:14.131
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4928
02:32:14.131 --> 02:32:15.680
<v Speaker 1>they have found all this,</v>

4929
02:32:15.690 --> 02:32:15.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4930
02:32:15.960 --> 02:32:20.960
<v Speaker 1>the smiley face artwork and they're thinking it might be a cell of serial</v>

4931
02:32:21.031 --> 02:32:21.864
<v Speaker 1>killers,</v>

4932
02:32:21.960 --> 02:32:22.793
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4933
02:32:23.220 --> 02:32:23.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4934
02:32:23.401 --> 02:32:25.840
<v Speaker 1>rather than just individuals that you know,</v>

4935
02:32:26.050 --> 02:32:29.250
<v Speaker 1>are linked that use the dark web.</v>

4936
02:32:29.251 --> 02:32:30.150
<v Speaker 1>And I thought that dark.</v>

4937
02:32:30.330 --> 02:32:35.330
<v Speaker 1>I thought that the dark web was largely already infiltrated by the federal</v>

4938
02:32:35.431 --> 02:32:39.000
<v Speaker 1>government and it was near impossible to stay anonymous at this point.</v>

4939
02:32:39.670 --> 02:32:40.503
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

4940
02:32:41.690 --> 02:32:46.690
<v Speaker 1>if not impossible because of the way things are stamped through the internet</v>

4941
02:32:47.361 --> 02:32:48.320
<v Speaker 1>protocol system.</v>

4942
02:32:48.970 --> 02:32:49.803
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4943
02:32:49.970 --> 02:32:51.950
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was gone.</v>

4944
02:32:51.980 --> 02:32:52.211
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4945
02:32:52.211 --> 02:32:54.710
<v Speaker 1>I thought the federal government and had a complete hold,</v>

4946
02:32:55.070 --> 02:32:56.990
<v Speaker 1>so it makes me wonder about this story,</v>

4947
02:32:56.991 --> 02:32:57.770
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

4948
02:32:57.770 --> 02:33:02.770
<v Speaker 1>and so the people that are being targeted supposedly are the best of the best</v>

4949
02:33:03.260 --> 02:33:04.041
<v Speaker 1>college kids.</v>

4950
02:33:04.041 --> 02:33:04.874
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4951
02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:06.833
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

4952
02:33:07.220 --> 02:33:08.053
<v Speaker 1>very bright,</v>

4953
02:33:08.300 --> 02:33:08.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4954
02:33:08.570 --> 02:33:09.530
<v Speaker 1>very athletic,</v>

4955
02:33:09.830 --> 02:33:12.470
<v Speaker 1>very good looking kids.</v>

4956
02:33:13.070 --> 02:33:15.140
<v Speaker 1>All these kids were found to have Ghb,</v>

4957
02:33:15.141 --> 02:33:16.940
<v Speaker 1>which is the date rape drug in their system.</v>

4958
02:33:17.960 --> 02:33:19.400
<v Speaker 1>And yeah,</v>

4959
02:33:19.401 --> 02:33:20.720
<v Speaker 1>so it's a.</v>

4960
02:33:21.110 --> 02:33:21.943
<v Speaker 1>So basically,</v>

4961
02:33:21.950 --> 02:33:22.783
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4962
02:33:23.280 --> 02:33:24.113
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4963
02:33:24.830 --> 02:33:27.150
<v Speaker 1>people take Ghb to uh,</v>

4964
02:33:27.170 --> 02:33:28.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how familiar you are with drugs.</v>

4965
02:33:28.790 --> 02:33:30.050
<v Speaker 1>Individuals take dhb.</v>

4966
02:33:30.051 --> 02:33:30.890
<v Speaker 1>It's just a,</v>

4967
02:33:31.070 --> 02:33:31.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4968
02:33:31.401 --> 02:33:32.234
<v Speaker 1>it's like a,</v>

4969
02:33:32.920 --> 02:33:34.220
<v Speaker 1>like it makes me feel good.</v>

4970
02:33:34.340 --> 02:33:35.210
<v Speaker 1>It makes you feel good.</v>

4971
02:33:35.240 --> 02:33:37.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not just a date rape drug.</v>

4972
02:33:37.311 --> 02:33:38.780
<v Speaker 1>There's individuals that take it to</v>

4973
02:33:39.200 --> 02:33:40.033
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4974
02:33:41.260 --> 02:33:42.810
<v Speaker 3>so it was a guy in high school,</v>

4975
02:33:42.811 --> 02:33:43.644
<v Speaker 3>I took it,</v>

4976
02:33:43.860 --> 02:33:44.740
<v Speaker 3>he took it so much,</v>

4977
02:33:44.760 --> 02:33:45.740
<v Speaker 3>the old and we were,</v>

4978
02:33:46.010 --> 02:33:47.880
<v Speaker 3>it was kind of just kind of a funny guy,</v>

4979
02:33:47.881 --> 02:33:49.590
<v Speaker 3>but we've got all set your date rapes himself.</v>

4980
02:33:50.140 --> 02:33:50.973
<v Speaker 3>Was this kind of</v>

4981
02:33:53.520 --> 02:33:53.930
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

4982
02:33:53.930 --> 02:33:55.170
<v Speaker 3>it was such a loser here that day.</v>

4983
02:33:55.171 --> 02:33:55.950
<v Speaker 3>Pray for himself.</v>

4984
02:33:55.950 --> 02:33:56.783
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

4985
02:33:59.070 --> 02:33:59.840
<v Speaker 3>anyways.</v>

4986
02:33:59.840 --> 02:34:00.241
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

4987
02:34:00.241 --> 02:34:00.620
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

4988
02:34:00.620 --> 02:34:00.871
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4989
02:34:00.871 --> 02:34:02.100
<v Speaker 3>it's just a weird thing and I'm,</v>

4990
02:34:02.490 --> 02:34:02.701
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4991
02:34:02.701 --> 02:34:03.630
<v Speaker 3>it makes me think that,</v>

4992
02:34:03.690 --> 02:34:04.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4993
02:34:04.080 --> 02:34:05.010
<v Speaker 3>who could be doing it,</v>

4994
02:34:05.040 --> 02:34:05.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4995
02:34:05.760 --> 02:34:08.140
<v Speaker 3>you know people who are collectivists,</v>

4996
02:34:08.141 --> 02:34:08.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4997
02:34:08.340 --> 02:34:09.480
<v Speaker 3>they don't like the individual.</v>

4998
02:34:09.481 --> 02:34:10.130
<v Speaker 3>I don't like the,</v>

4999
02:34:10.130 --> 02:34:11.160
<v Speaker 3>if it's even real,</v>

5000
02:34:11.430 --> 02:34:12.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5001
02:34:12.060 --> 02:34:13.480
<v Speaker 3>who knows if I think,</v>

5002
02:34:14.780 --> 02:34:14.940
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

5003
02:34:14.940 --> 02:34:16.510
<v Speaker 3>I think they're probably just like,</v>

5004
02:34:16.530 --> 02:34:18.250
<v Speaker 3>they're probably like no</v>

5005
02:34:18.550 --> 02:34:20.110
<v Speaker 4>pathological individuals,</v>

5006
02:34:20.430 --> 02:34:21.263
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5007
02:34:21.420 --> 02:34:21.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5008
02:34:21.970 --> 02:34:26.970
<v Speaker 4>so I think we should just shoot this pupil up to be honest.</v>

5009
02:34:27.470 --> 02:34:27.960
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5010
02:34:27.960 --> 02:34:29.080
<v Speaker 4>and it reminds me of the,</v>

5011
02:34:29.081 --> 02:34:29.770
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5012
02:34:29.770 --> 02:34:31.450
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember Peterson said this,</v>

5013
02:34:31.570 --> 02:34:34.990
<v Speaker 4>but it was between the wild hundreds and the 16 hundreds.</v>

5014
02:34:34.991 --> 02:34:35.710
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

5015
02:34:35.710 --> 02:34:40.000
<v Speaker 4>I think the violent death rate in Europe went down by like an order of</v>

5016
02:34:40.001 --> 02:34:40.571
<v Speaker 4>magnitude.</v>

5017
02:34:40.571 --> 02:34:42.670
<v Speaker 4>So I think it was like $1,000.</v>

5018
02:34:42.671 --> 02:34:45.940
<v Speaker 4>There was no one for 10,000 and that's because they,</v>

5019
02:34:46.360 --> 02:34:49.180
<v Speaker 4>the law and order started coming into effect and he basically started killing</v>

5020
02:34:49.181 --> 02:34:50.170
<v Speaker 4>all the criminals off.</v>

5021
02:34:50.730 --> 02:34:51.280
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5022
02:34:51.280 --> 02:34:52.040
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

5023
02:34:52.040 --> 02:34:52.630
<v Speaker 4>but I mean,</v>

5024
02:34:52.630 --> 02:34:55.030
<v Speaker 4>I think that when in our society,</v>

5025
02:34:55.360 --> 02:34:57.400
<v Speaker 4>the crime like that is so rare.</v>

5026
02:34:57.401 --> 02:35:00.670
<v Speaker 4>It might just be that this person's just a genetic,</v>

5027
02:35:01.580 --> 02:35:01.931
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5028
02:35:01.931 --> 02:35:05.270
<v Speaker 4>you can't really eliminate it because it just pops up once in a while.</v>

5029
02:35:05.280 --> 02:35:06.550
<v Speaker 4>Sort of like a rare disease.</v>

5030
02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:07.570
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

5031
02:35:07.570 --> 02:35:07.691
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

5032
02:35:07.691 --> 02:35:09.190
<v Speaker 4>it's hundreds of murders now.</v>

5033
02:35:10.110 --> 02:35:10.943
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5034
02:35:10.950 --> 02:35:15.500
<v Speaker 4>Hundreds of hundreds of suspected murders in all,</v>

5035
02:35:15.760 --> 02:35:17.770
<v Speaker 4>in different cities in the United States.</v>

5036
02:35:17.771 --> 02:35:18.970
<v Speaker 4>All bearing the same,</v>

5037
02:35:20.260 --> 02:35:21.093
<v Speaker 4>not all,</v>

5038
02:35:21.160 --> 02:35:22.420
<v Speaker 4>many bearing the same.</v>

5039
02:35:23.230 --> 02:35:25.150
<v Speaker 4>A toxicology reports,</v>

5040
02:35:25.640 --> 02:35:26.473
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5041
02:35:26.560 --> 02:35:28.000
<v Speaker 4>finding the,</v>

5042
02:35:29.170 --> 02:35:30.250
<v Speaker 4>if I can remember correctly,</v>

5043
02:35:30.251 --> 02:35:31.540
<v Speaker 4>finding the graffiti,</v>

5044
02:35:31.541 --> 02:35:33.670
<v Speaker 4>the similar graffiti in the same areas.</v>

5045
02:35:34.250 --> 02:35:35.083
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

5046
02:35:35.560 --> 02:35:36.460
<v Speaker 4>and they think that it,</v>

5047
02:35:36.520 --> 02:35:37.031
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>

5048
02:35:37.031 --> 02:35:37.864
<v Speaker 4>it's a cell,</v>

5049
02:35:37.960 --> 02:35:41.260
<v Speaker 4>it's a group of individuals that can change,</v>

5050
02:35:41.261 --> 02:35:44.920
<v Speaker 4>like there might be so many individuals that they can just basically like</v>

5051
02:35:45.700 --> 02:35:49.150
<v Speaker 4>interchange themselves in him,</v>

5052
02:35:49.420 --> 02:35:49.691
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5053
02:35:49.691 --> 02:35:50.780
<v Speaker 4>at any given will.</v>

5054
02:35:50.820 --> 02:35:51.760
<v Speaker 4>And that's the thing.</v>

5055
02:35:51.761 --> 02:35:52.594
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

5056
02:35:52.910 --> 02:35:53.743
<v Speaker 4>it just,</v>

5057
02:35:53.840 --> 02:35:55.580
<v Speaker 4>it's really fucking suspect.</v>

5058
02:35:55.581 --> 02:35:57.370
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what I just heard about it.</v>

5059
02:35:57.371 --> 02:35:57.731
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5060
02:35:57.731 --> 02:35:58.564
<v Speaker 4>I just read it on.</v>

5061
02:35:59.230 --> 02:35:59.921
<v Speaker 4>I forget that,</v>

5062
02:35:59.921 --> 02:36:00.131
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5063
02:36:00.131 --> 02:36:01.570
<v Speaker 4>I should try and pull it up.</v>

5064
02:36:01.571 --> 02:36:02.404
<v Speaker 4>I don't know that,</v>

5065
02:36:02.530 --> 02:36:02.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5066
02:36:02.820 --> 02:36:03.050
<v Speaker 4>drugs,</v>

5067
02:36:03.050 --> 02:36:04.930
<v Speaker 4>just an aggregate of news sources.</v>

5068
02:36:04.931 --> 02:36:06.310
<v Speaker 4>I always hate dimension drudge,</v>

5069
02:36:06.340 --> 02:36:11.340
<v Speaker 4>but I almost never remember the actual which matters where I'm getting the,</v>

5070
02:36:12.580 --> 02:36:13.930
<v Speaker 4>who's putting out the story.</v>

5071
02:36:14.570 --> 02:36:15.403
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

5072
02:36:16.750 --> 02:36:17.820
<v Speaker 4>I haven't seen it yet,</v>

5073
02:36:18.190 --> 02:36:18.940
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>

5074
02:36:18.940 --> 02:36:19.773
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

5075
02:36:19.920 --> 02:36:22.420
<v Speaker 4>I go by this mantra that the truth is the truth,</v>

5076
02:36:22.421 --> 02:36:23.500
<v Speaker 4>no matter what the source.</v>

5077
02:36:23.590 --> 02:36:24.460
<v Speaker 4>So if it's true,</v>

5078
02:36:24.461 --> 02:36:25.750
<v Speaker 4>then I don't care about the source.</v>

5079
02:36:26.830 --> 02:36:27.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5080
02:36:27.610 --> 02:36:28.480
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's the thing.</v>

5081
02:36:28.481 --> 02:36:29.750
<v Speaker 4>How do you find out if it's true or not?</v>

5082
02:36:29.760 --> 02:36:30.593
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

5083
02:36:30.940 --> 02:36:31.211
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5084
02:36:31.211 --> 02:36:31.371
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5085
02:36:31.371 --> 02:36:32.290
<v Speaker 4>I never even heard about it.</v>

5086
02:36:32.291 --> 02:36:35.710
<v Speaker 4>I don't ever hear about it in the mainstream media or anything like that.</v>

5087
02:36:35.711 --> 02:36:36.544
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>

5088
02:36:36.730 --> 02:36:39.100
<v Speaker 4>I mean a group of serial killers rather than,</v>

5089
02:36:40.840 --> 02:36:41.673
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

5090
02:36:41.950 --> 02:36:42.161
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

5091
02:36:42.161 --> 02:36:42.400
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

5092
02:36:42.400 --> 02:36:42.730
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

5093
02:36:42.730 --> 02:36:46.300
<v Speaker 4>the thing with the conspiracies as the more people that are involved,</v>

5094
02:36:46.450 --> 02:36:50.620
<v Speaker 4>some moral likely or the less likely it's going to remain a conspiracy is the</v>

5095
02:36:50.621 --> 02:36:53.020
<v Speaker 4>more mouths and more ears than more mistakes.</v>

5096
02:36:54.100 --> 02:36:55.630
<v Speaker 4>So if it is,</v>

5097
02:36:55.631 --> 02:36:58.240
<v Speaker 4>a lot of it is a lot of people hopefully will be found out.</v>

5098
02:36:58.720 --> 02:36:59.553
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

5099
02:37:00.970 --> 02:37:01.631
<v Speaker 4>fucked up.</v>

<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

5121
02:37:30.110 --> 02:37:31.770
<v Speaker 1>the AP English 12 teacher,</v>

5122
02:37:32.310 --> 02:37:32.901
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

5123
02:37:32.901 --> 02:37:33.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5124

<v Speaker 1>you guys got to read this.</v>

5126
02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:36.331
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

5127
02:37:36.331 --> 02:37:37.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why they want you to read 19,</v>

5128
02:37:37.981 --> 02:37:39.530
<v Speaker 1>84 was like,</v>

5129
02:37:39.560 --> 02:37:40.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where the world's going,</v>

5130
02:37:40.921 --> 02:37:44.310
<v Speaker 1>but it's required reading now that brave new world.</v>

5131
02:37:44.940 --> 02:37:45.301
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

5132
02:37:45.301 --> 02:37:46.860
<v Speaker 1>so not going to be,</v>

5133
02:37:47.220 --> 02:37:48.840
<v Speaker 1>not going to get around to some of the other books.</v>

5134
02:37:48.841 --> 02:37:49.471
<v Speaker 1>I like the teacher,</v>

5135
02:37:49.471 --> 02:37:50.650
<v Speaker 1>but nothing.</v>

5136
02:37:51.550 --> 02:37:52.680
<v Speaker 1>It was just kind of interesting.</v>

5137
02:37:52.681 --> 02:37:53.514
<v Speaker 1>He was making sense.</v>

5138
02:37:57.260 --> 02:38:01.170
<v Speaker 5>I came across this a thing of the day on reddit and it was someone that was</v>

5139
02:38:01.180 --> 02:38:01.290
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

5140
02:38:01.290 --> 02:38:03.000
<v Speaker 5>it was like a probable,</v>

5141
02:38:03.001 --> 02:38:06.810
<v Speaker 5>not see a guy like a neofascist or whatever.</v>

5142
02:38:07.350 --> 02:38:12.350
<v Speaker 5>And there's a reddit called 1984 and the guy made a post like detailing about</v>

5143
02:38:12.361 --> 02:38:13.550
<v Speaker 5>how 1984,</v>

5144
02:38:13.551 --> 02:38:17.160
<v Speaker 5>it's actually left pick a leftist collectivism rather than write collectivism.</v>

5145
02:38:17.400 --> 02:38:18.420
<v Speaker 5>Which is actually,</v>

5146
02:38:18.480 --> 02:38:19.380
<v Speaker 5>I think that's true.</v>

5147
02:38:19.650 --> 02:38:20.483
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

5148
02:38:20.940 --> 02:38:21.773
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>

5149
02:38:22.200 --> 02:38:27.180
<v Speaker 5>I got down voted for agreeing with a Nazi about something that was true.</v>

5150
02:38:27.450 --> 02:38:27.800
<v Speaker 5>I thought,</v>

5151
02:38:27.800 --> 02:38:28.170
<v Speaker 5>I agree,</v>

5152
02:38:28.170 --> 02:38:30.140
<v Speaker 5>but just be agreeing that what he said was true.</v>

5153
02:38:30.160 --> 02:38:31.510
<v Speaker 5>Doesn't mean I agree with Nazi-ism,</v>

5154
02:38:31.511 --> 02:38:33.220
<v Speaker 5>which just disagreed with the,</v>

5155
02:38:33.590 --> 02:38:33.790
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5156
02:38:33.790 --> 02:38:34.623
<v Speaker 5>his assessment.</v>

5157
02:38:34.820 --> 02:38:35.653
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5158
02:38:36.050 --> 02:38:36.601
<v Speaker 5>I was trying to,</v>

5159
02:38:36.601 --> 02:38:36.811
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

5160
02:38:36.811 --> 02:38:37.500
<v Speaker 5>they like,</v>

5161
02:38:37.500 --> 02:38:39.570
<v Speaker 5>and the guys were like looking through his post history,</v>

5162
02:38:39.571 --> 02:38:40.404
<v Speaker 5>I think his name was,</v>

5163
02:38:41.280 --> 02:38:42.113
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

5164
02:38:42.330 --> 02:38:43.740
<v Speaker 5>something white,</v>

5165
02:38:43.741 --> 02:38:47.430
<v Speaker 5>something four slash four slash 2014 year years or something.</v>

5166
02:38:47.610 --> 02:38:48.361
<v Speaker 5>So I was just like,</v>

5167
02:38:48.361 --> 02:38:48.511
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

5168
02:38:48.511 --> 02:38:50.850
<v Speaker 5>obviously he's a Nazi but I don't care because that's not what,</v>

5169
02:38:50.880 --> 02:38:52.230
<v Speaker 5>that's not what the argument is.</v>

5170
02:38:52.260 --> 02:38:53.130
<v Speaker 5>That's not what he's saying.</v>

5171
02:38:54.270 --> 02:38:57.270
<v Speaker 5>The argument is that it's a leftist collectivism.</v>

5172
02:38:57.480 --> 02:38:58.051
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

5173
02:38:58.051 --> 02:38:58.141
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

5174
02:38:58.141 --> 02:38:58.740
<v Speaker 5>that's true.</v>

5175
02:38:58.740 --> 02:38:59.610
<v Speaker 5>But a lot of people are like,</v>

5176
02:38:59.820 --> 02:39:00.361
<v Speaker 5>get out of here.</v>

5177
02:39:00.361 --> 02:39:01.290
<v Speaker 5>You're not see like,</v>

5178
02:39:01.350 --> 02:39:02.640
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to hear your opinion.</v>

5179
02:39:02.940 --> 02:39:04.140
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

5180
02:39:04.890 --> 02:39:06.620
<v Speaker 5>I just thought that was stupid because like,</v>

5181
02:39:06.840 --> 02:39:07.561
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't matter.</v>

5182
02:39:07.561 --> 02:39:07.920
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

5183
02:39:07.920 --> 02:39:09.720
<v Speaker 5>Santa Claus said it doesn't make a difference.</v>

5184
02:39:09.960 --> 02:39:10.321
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

5185
02:39:10.321 --> 02:39:11.154
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5186
02:39:11.980 --> 02:39:12.300
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5187
02:39:12.300 --> 02:39:14.790
<v Speaker 5>I just think it's a bad rhetoric on the front of the left.</v>

5188
02:39:14.840 --> 02:39:15.673
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>

5189
02:39:15.760 --> 02:39:17.010
<v Speaker 5>you the MPC meme.</v>

5190
02:39:17.190 --> 02:39:18.023
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5191
02:39:18.420 --> 02:39:18.631
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5192
02:39:18.631 --> 02:39:19.530
<v Speaker 5>It's like that whole thing,</v>

5193
02:39:19.560 --> 02:39:20.220
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5194
02:39:20.220 --> 02:39:25.220
<v Speaker 5>they've got a limited set of responses and the run through them and then after a</v>

5195
02:39:25.251 --> 02:39:26.084
<v Speaker 5>while they just,</v>

5196
02:39:26.170 --> 02:39:26.821
<v Speaker 5>you're just like,</v>

5197
02:39:26.821 --> 02:39:28.230
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck do I even say to you anymore?</v>

5198
02:39:28.231 --> 02:39:28.370
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>

5208
02:39:36.490 --> 02:39:40.490
<v Speaker 5>I got rid of my facebook because I was having these conversations with people</v>

5221
02:39:58.101 --> 02:39:59.540

5222
02:40:00.200 --> 02:40:01.430
<v Speaker 1>never post anything.</v>

5223
02:40:01.431 --> 02:40:02.264
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

5224
02:40:04.650 --> 02:40:05.483
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:06.751
<v Speaker 5>well I have this,</v>

5226
02:40:06.751 --> 02:40:07.230
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5227
02:40:07.230 --> 02:40:09.960
<v Speaker 5>I have a fake facebook account that I use once in a while.</v>

5228
02:40:10.080 --> 02:40:10.411
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

5229
02:40:10.411 --> 02:40:10.981
<v Speaker 5>it's called,</v>

5230
02:40:10.981 --> 02:40:11.814
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5231
02:40:13.200 --> 02:40:15.600
<v Speaker 5>I joined this group called left versus right or whatever,</v>

5232
02:40:15.690 --> 02:40:16.830
<v Speaker 5>and it says I can pull a group.</v>

5233
02:40:17.290 --> 02:40:18.123
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

5234
02:40:18.630 --> 02:40:22.440
<v Speaker 5>but at the beginning it was like shit posting and then it became political than</v>

5235
02:40:22.441 --> 02:40:23.520
<v Speaker 5>it was more shit posting.</v>

5236
02:40:24.150 --> 02:40:26.790
<v Speaker 5>But now it's a very often.</v>

5237
02:40:26.791 --> 02:40:30.840
<v Speaker 5>But I think the trumps is basically divided between trump and anti trump now,</v>

5238
02:40:31.050 --> 02:40:32.340
<v Speaker 5>which is kind of lame.</v>

5239
02:40:32.640 --> 02:40:33.630
<v Speaker 5>But I did.</v>

5240
02:40:33.700 --> 02:40:38.160
<v Speaker 5>Anti-Trump guys are guys I used to argue with a lot because I used to be a</v>

5241
02:40:38.161 --> 02:40:38.701
<v Speaker 5>socialist.</v>

5242
02:40:38.701 --> 02:40:39.270
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

5243
02:40:39.270 --> 02:40:39.890
<v Speaker 5>So I've,</v>

5244
02:40:39.890 --> 02:40:41.160
<v Speaker 5>I've been the things I've,</v>

5245
02:40:41.280 --> 02:40:43.260
<v Speaker 5>I've changed and adapted and I've learned,</v>

5246
02:40:43.470 --> 02:40:44.740
<v Speaker 5>I'm different,</v>

5247
02:40:45.390 --> 02:40:46.680
<v Speaker 5>not really learn different ideas,</v>

5248
02:40:46.681 --> 02:40:50.730
<v Speaker 5>I've absorbed different ideas and now I just think completely differently,</v>

5249
02:40:51.230 --> 02:40:51.780
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5250
02:40:51.780 --> 02:40:52.613
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

5251
02:40:53.310 --> 02:40:54.143
<v Speaker 5>but it took me,</v>

5252
02:40:54.780 --> 02:40:58.620
<v Speaker 5>it took me listening to people with different views and taking their thoughts</v>

5253
02:40:58.621 --> 02:41:00.000
<v Speaker 5>genuinely rather than just,</v>

5254
02:41:00.001 --> 02:41:00.590
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5255
02:41:00.590 --> 02:41:01.423
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5256
02:41:01.740 --> 02:41:04.340
<v Speaker 5>ignoring them because they think differently than me.</v>

5257
02:41:04.341 --> 02:41:05.174
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

5258

02:41:11.680 --> 02:41:12.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what,</v>

5264
02:41:14.760 --> 02:41:15.593

<v Speaker 1>and he,</v>

5279
02:41:33.090 --> 02:41:35.980
<v Speaker 1>maybe it might've been a talk show host or talent.</v>

02:41:39.820 --> 02:41:42.170
<v Speaker 1>like he's a baseball announcer or a news</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean one time I heard him kind of go off on somebody.</v>

5316
02:42:35.551 --> 02:42:35.851
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

5317
02:42:35.851 --> 02:42:36.684
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

02:42:40.161 --> 02:42:40.411
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5323
02:42:40.411 --> 02:42:41.244
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

5324
02:42:41.340 --> 02:42:42.750
<v Speaker 1>he lived in the Chicago land area.</v>

5325
02:42:42.751 --> 02:42:43.170
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

5326
02:42:43.170 --> 02:42:43.681
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

5327
02:42:43.681 --> 02:42:44.514
<v Speaker 1>that's why.</v>

5328
02:42:44.610 --> 02:42:44.950
<v Speaker 1>Because I,</v>

5329
02:42:44.950 --> 02:42:45.281
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5330
02:42:45.281 --> 02:42:46.080
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

5331
02:42:46.080 --> 02:42:46.913
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

5332
02:42:47.060 --> 02:42:49.440
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a cliche thing,</v>

5333
02:42:49.441 --> 02:42:49.981
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

5334
02:42:49.981 --> 02:42:51.240
<v Speaker 1>when you grow up in Chicago land area,</v>

5335
02:42:51.241 --> 02:42:55.710
<v Speaker 1>you run into certain people who have the same attitudes and you know,</v>

5336
02:42:55.720 --> 02:42:56.553
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

5337
02:42:58.590 --> 02:43:01.390
<v Speaker 5>he's actually like a relatively reasonable,</v>

5338
02:43:01.391 --> 02:43:02.200
<v Speaker 5>like leftist.</v>

5339
02:43:02.200 --> 02:43:02.650
<v Speaker 5>Like he,</v>

5340
02:43:02.650 --> 02:43:03.820
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he's as great.</v>

5341
02:43:04.060 --> 02:43:06.790
<v Speaker 5>I think the pro like crazy,</v>

5342
02:43:07.030 --> 02:43:07.630
<v Speaker 5>funnily enough,</v>

5343
02:43:07.630 --> 02:43:10.850
<v Speaker 5>I think he's more reasonable than like [inaudible] and like an,</v>

5344
02:43:11.050 --> 02:43:11.883
<v Speaker 5>I guess</v>

5345
02:43:12.380 --> 02:43:14.080
<v Speaker 4>just casper the friendly ghost.</v>

5346
02:43:14.160 --> 02:43:16.500
<v Speaker 4>I've got a in,</v>

5347
02:43:16.720 --> 02:43:18.760
<v Speaker 4>which is weird because he's kind of the crazy one,</v>

5348
02:43:18.790 --> 02:43:22.420
<v Speaker 4>but I think it's just probably where he's from as he said northeastern over</v>

5349
02:43:23.260 --> 02:43:23.801
<v Speaker 4>Chicago,</v>

5350
02:43:23.801 --> 02:43:24.580
<v Speaker 4>Midwest yet.</v>

5351
02:43:24.580 --> 02:43:25.413
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

5352
02:43:25.640 --> 02:43:25.880
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

5353
02:43:25.880 --> 02:43:27.460
<v Speaker 4>maybe he went a.</v>

5354
02:43:27.690 --> 02:43:28.160
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

5355
02:43:28.160 --> 02:43:29.050
<v Speaker 4>get you to fair.</v>

5356
02:43:29.090 --> 02:43:29.340
<v Speaker 4>Come on,</v>

5357
02:43:29.340 --> 02:43:29.830
<v Speaker 4>get down.</v>

5358
02:43:29.830 --> 02:43:30.131
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

5359
02:43:30.131 --> 02:43:30.964
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5360
02:43:31.090 --> 02:43:31.923
<v Speaker 4>he was talking to,</v>

5361
02:43:32.380 --> 02:43:34.050
<v Speaker 4>they had done a funny thing again,</v>

5362
02:43:34.110 --> 02:43:34.770
<v Speaker 4>let's back up.</v>

5363
02:43:34.770 --> 02:43:39.770
<v Speaker 4>And they were talking about immigration and trump made the remark and I don't</v>

5364
02:43:42.251 --> 02:43:43.570
<v Speaker 4>know why he made the remark.</v>

5365
02:43:43.571 --> 02:43:44.080
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5366
02:43:44.080 --> 02:43:46.510
<v Speaker 4>I guess he just does it because he's just going to talk and say whatever he</v>

5367
02:43:46.511 --> 02:43:46.781
<v Speaker 4>wants,</v>

5368
02:43:46.781 --> 02:43:47.560
<v Speaker 4>which is fine.</v>

5369
02:43:47.560 --> 02:43:48.020
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

5370
02:43:48.020 --> 02:43:49.160
<v Speaker 4>but he was like,</v>

5371
02:43:49.300 --> 02:43:50.133
<v Speaker 4>the uh,</v>

5372
02:43:50.230 --> 02:43:53.410
<v Speaker 4>immigrants have the best cars and he didn't say Emirates,</v>

5373
02:43:53.411 --> 02:43:53.591
<v Speaker 4>sorry.</v>

5374
02:43:53.591 --> 02:43:54.424
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

5375
02:43:54.970 --> 02:43:55.810
<v Speaker 4>the kind of,</v>

5376
02:43:55.870 --> 02:43:58.780
<v Speaker 4>it seemed to be taken out of context and it was like they've got the best</v>

5377
02:43:58.781 --> 02:44:03.540
<v Speaker 4>vehicles and then Jimmy Dore and then his wife and Ron Falconi,</v>

5378
02:44:03.590 --> 02:44:04.960
<v Speaker 4>they kind of going off and they're like,</v>

5379
02:44:05.080 --> 02:44:05.481
<v Speaker 4>what do you mean,</v>

5380
02:44:05.481 --> 02:44:06.670
<v Speaker 4>think of the best cars,</v>

5381
02:44:06.790 --> 02:44:07.091
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

5382
02:44:07.091 --> 02:44:07.924
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>

5383
02:44:08.340 --> 02:44:13.030
<v Speaker 4>like I didn't see anything before it and I don't catch the live shows because he</v>

5384
02:44:13.031 --> 02:44:13.631
<v Speaker 4>only cuts,</v>

5385
02:44:13.631 --> 02:44:17.180
<v Speaker 4>clips of his shows and then you,</v>

5386
02:44:17.230 --> 02:44:20.520
<v Speaker 4>you don't get to see the full live show unless you're a supporter,</v>

5387
02:44:20.530 --> 02:44:22.780
<v Speaker 4>a Patriot supporter or wherever that works.</v>

5388
02:44:23.830 --> 02:44:24.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5389
02:44:24.590 --> 02:44:26.110
<v Speaker 4>I don't support them because I don't,</v>

5390
02:44:26.290 --> 02:44:29.160
<v Speaker 4>it's not in because I like them comes because they don't have enough money now.</v>

5391
02:44:31.210 --> 02:44:32.043
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

5392
02:44:33.110 --> 02:44:34.360
<v Speaker 4>because I liked their content,</v>

5393
02:44:34.361 --> 02:44:35.620
<v Speaker 4>but I mean he was totally,</v>

5394
02:44:35.650 --> 02:44:37.810
<v Speaker 4>they're totally taken trump out of context.</v>

5395
02:44:38.170 --> 02:44:39.640
<v Speaker 4>But then I just stepped back for a second.</v>

5396
02:44:39.641 --> 02:44:40.474
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

5397
02:44:41.260 --> 02:44:42.370
<v Speaker 4>he's a fucking comedian.</v>

5398
02:44:42.371 --> 02:44:42.581
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5399
02:44:42.581 --> 02:44:43.414
<v Speaker 4>it's not,</v>

5400
02:44:45.990 --> 02:44:46.823
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

5401
02:44:47.230 --> 02:44:48.330
<v Speaker 4>I guess it depends.</v>

5402
02:44:48.331 --> 02:44:48.661
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

5403
02:44:48.661 --> 02:44:48.821
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

5404
02:44:48.821 --> 02:44:49.654
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5405
02:44:49.810 --> 02:44:50.350
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

5406
02:44:50.350 --> 02:44:51.183
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

5407
02:44:51.330 --> 02:44:53.550
<v Speaker 4>you really shouldn't get a free pass.</v>

5408
02:44:54.030 --> 02:44:54.271
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

5409
02:44:54.271 --> 02:44:55.290
<v Speaker 4>no matter who you are,</v>

5410
02:44:55.830 --> 02:44:57.840
<v Speaker 4>if you're trying to influence the political process.</v>

5411
02:44:57.841 --> 02:44:58.674
<v Speaker 4>I guess that's,</v>

5412
02:44:58.860 --> 02:45:02.260
<v Speaker 4>it comes down to like a duty responsibility,</v>

5413
02:45:02.540 --> 02:45:03.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5414
02:45:03.030 --> 02:45:07.980
<v Speaker 4>who am I affecting a WHO's going to believe the shit that I say?</v>

5415
02:45:08.040 --> 02:45:08.341
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>

5416
02:45:08.341 --> 02:45:11.730
<v Speaker 4>so I mentioned this because I made a comment in the section like,</v>

5417
02:45:12.180 --> 02:45:14.960
<v Speaker 4>I believe it was the coyotes and of course I got</v>

5418
02:45:18.070 --> 02:45:20.260
<v Speaker 4>probably 20 comments down and people just,</v>

5419
02:45:20.620 --> 02:45:21.453
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5420
02:45:21.580 --> 02:45:21.970
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

5421
02:45:21.970 --> 02:45:24.190
<v Speaker 4>I guess you believe what you believe.</v>

5422
02:45:24.191 --> 02:45:24.911
<v Speaker 4>A lot of bullshit,</v>

5423
02:45:24.911 --> 02:45:25.481
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure.</v>

5424
02:45:25.481 --> 02:45:28.540
<v Speaker 4>And just all this shit and they're thinking about it.</v>

5425
02:45:28.541 --> 02:45:28.781
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

5426

02:45:28.991 --> 02:45:33.991
<v Speaker 4>these people do not like trump and they definitely don't like to be a</v>

5428
02:45:36.040 --> 02:45:36.791
<v Speaker 4>put on the spot,</v>

5429
02:45:36.791 --> 02:45:37.301

<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

5433
02:45:39.170 --> 02:45:40.003
<v Speaker 4>that's true.</v>

5434
02:45:40.100 --> 02:45:40.691
<v Speaker 4>If they don't like,</v>

5435
02:45:40.691 --> 02:45:41.290
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5436
02:45:41.290 --> 02:45:43.120
<v Speaker 4>they don't like conflict with their ideology,</v>

5437
02:45:43.121 --> 02:45:43.954
<v Speaker 4>that's for sure.</v>

5438
02:45:44.200 --> 02:45:45.033
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5439
02:45:45.210 --> 02:45:45.910
<v Speaker 4>If,</v>

5440
02:45:45.910 --> 02:45:46.740
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5441
02:45:46.740 --> 02:45:50.860
<v Speaker 4>a son that's seems to be common amongst most of the leftist ideologue.</v>

5442
02:45:57.960 --> 02:45:58.793
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5443
02:45:59.820 --> 02:46:00.601
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

5444
02:46:00.601 --> 02:46:01.434
<v Speaker 4>so I don't know,</v>

5445
02:46:01.610 --> 02:46:02.443
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

5446
02:46:03.550 --> 02:46:04.590
<v Speaker 4>I'm starting to get like the.</v>

5447
02:46:05.430 --> 02:46:05.671
<v Speaker 4>Sorry,</v>

5448
02:46:05.671 --> 02:46:06.504
<v Speaker 4>go ahead.</v>

5449
02:46:07.050 --> 02:46:07.270
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

5450
02:46:07.270 --> 02:46:08.103
<v Speaker 4>the young,</v>

5451
02:46:08.300 --> 02:46:08.971
<v Speaker 4>the young Turks,</v>

5452
02:46:08.971 --> 02:46:10.220
<v Speaker 4>I find them to be pretty,</v>

5453
02:46:10.610 --> 02:46:11.510
<v Speaker 5>pretty crazy.</v>

5454
02:46:11.630 --> 02:46:14.000
<v Speaker 5>Like I used to actually be a subscriber to them.</v>

5455
02:46:14.370 --> 02:46:14.640
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>

5456
02:46:14.640 --> 02:46:16.430
<v Speaker 5>I thought they were kind of reasonable back in the day,</v>

5457
02:46:16.820 --> 02:46:17.360
<v Speaker 5>but now,</v>

5458
02:46:17.360 --> 02:46:18.920
<v Speaker 5>but now that they've kind of gone,</v>

5459
02:46:19.040 --> 02:46:24.040
<v Speaker 5>I guess for the last couple of years I eventually decided subscribed like this</v>

5460
02:46:24.411 --> 02:46:24.920
<v Speaker 5>whole sites,</v>

5461
02:46:24.920 --> 02:46:26.990
<v Speaker 5>like this little group is bullshit.</v>

5462
02:46:26.991 --> 02:46:27.760
<v Speaker 5>Like they,</v>

5463
02:46:27.760 --> 02:46:29.270
<v Speaker 5>they just make shit up half the time.</v>

5464
02:46:29.271 --> 02:46:30.950
<v Speaker 5>Are they there are so slanted,</v>

5465
02:46:32.860 --> 02:46:33.270
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5466
02:46:33.270 --> 02:46:35.490
<v Speaker 5>like it's hard to explain that.</v>

5467
02:46:36.030 --> 02:46:36.351
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

5468
02:46:36.351 --> 02:46:36.711
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>

5469
02:46:36.711 --> 02:46:37.401
<v Speaker 5>I'm totally lost.</v>

5470
02:46:37.401 --> 02:46:38.240
<v Speaker 5>I lost faith in them,</v>

5471
02:46:38.241 --> 02:46:42.140
<v Speaker 5>so I just unsubscribed and they've gotten worse since.</v>

5472
02:46:42.141 --> 02:46:43.970
<v Speaker 5>So I guess it was a good idea.</v>

5473
02:46:44.410 --> 02:46:45.243
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5474
02:46:45.840 --> 02:46:46.490
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

5475
02:46:46.490 --> 02:46:48.540
<v Speaker 5>I've never really watched the young Turks infective,</v>

5476
02:46:48.560 --> 02:46:50.900
<v Speaker 5>watched them more just to hear them,</v>

5477
02:46:50.960 --> 02:46:51.860
<v Speaker 5>what they're saying</v>

5478
02:46:52.520 --> 02:46:54.020
<v Speaker 8>a w</v>

5479

<v Speaker 5>recently.</v>

5480
02:46:55.061 --> 02:46:55.481
<v Speaker 5>But I mean,</v>

5481
02:46:55.481 --> 02:46:56.314
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

5482
02:46:56.950 --> 02:46:58.570
<v Speaker 5>I never think would go like,</v>

5483

5488
02:47:05.830 --> 02:47:07.060
<v Speaker 5>what they're talking about,</v>

5489
02:47:07.061 --> 02:47:08.440
<v Speaker 5>the stories that they're talking about,</v>

5490
02:47:08.441 --> 02:47:09.490
<v Speaker 5>how they're framing it,</v>

5491
02:47:10.660 --> 02:47:12.430
<v Speaker 5>how the framing certain stories.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I know there's a lot of good youtube youtubers.</v>

5505
02:47:31.700 --> 02:47:32.533
<v Speaker 5>A,</v>

5506
02:47:33.040 --> 02:47:33.970
<v Speaker 8>I don't know how old</v>

5507
02:47:35.490 --> 02:47:36.990
<v Speaker 5>the has been on Youtube,</v>

5508
02:47:38.610 --> 02:47:43.500
<v Speaker 5>but I've always kind of associated Sargon the thunder foot probably from,</v>

5509
02:47:43.750 --> 02:47:46.790
<v Speaker 5>from like 2013 from when I first heard her.</v>

5510
02:47:46.800 --> 02:47:48.750
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if these have been around since then,</v>

5511
02:47:49.530 --> 02:47:53.880
<v Speaker 5>but I don't know that many that I would find more interesting,</v>

5512
02:47:54.540 --> 02:47:55.280
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

5513
02:47:55.280 --> 02:47:56.040
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

5514
02:47:56.040 --> 02:47:56.970
<v Speaker 5>there's a couple,</v>

5515
02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:58.980
<v Speaker 5>there's a couple I've been listening to lately.</v>

5516
02:47:58.990 --> 02:47:59.820
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

5517
02:47:59.820 --> 02:48:00.800
<v Speaker 5>count Denckla.</v>

5518
02:48:00.920 --> 02:48:01.380
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

5519
02:48:01.380 --> 02:48:02.213
<v Speaker 5>it was one,</v>

5520
02:48:02.680 --> 02:48:03.370
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

5521
02:48:03.370 --> 02:48:04.230
<v Speaker 5>Sargon was,</v>

5522
02:48:04.530 --> 02:48:09.240
<v Speaker 5>I think it started with Sargon and then from there I got to dangle a because of</v>

5523
02:48:09.241 --> 02:48:13.410
<v Speaker 5>the Nazi punk thing and then I think I then eventually it was like I would hear</v>

5524
02:48:13.411 --> 02:48:14.530
<v Speaker 5>v quite a bit of a star events.</v>

5525
02:48:14.531 --> 02:48:14.821
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

5526
02:48:14.821 --> 02:48:15.000
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

5527
02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:15.880
<v Speaker 5>check out with V and e.</v>

5528
02:48:15.920 --> 02:48:17.160
<v Speaker 5>he's actually pretty interesting.</v>

5529
02:48:17.220 --> 02:48:18.053
<v Speaker 5>He has like a,</v>

5530
02:48:18.360 --> 02:48:21.600
<v Speaker 5>I like b because he's a little bit unique.</v>

5531
02:48:21.650 --> 02:48:24.330
<v Speaker 5>Like he has different views from eastern Europe.</v>

5532
02:48:24.620 --> 02:48:26.280
<v Speaker 5>It was like a completely different view.</v>

5533
02:48:27.030 --> 02:48:27.863
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

5534
02:48:29.100 --> 02:48:31.650
<v Speaker 5>so he kind of gives me some good arguments and points.</v>

5535
02:48:31.651 --> 02:48:31.980
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

5536
02:48:31.980 --> 02:48:32.450
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

5537
02:48:32.450 --> 02:48:32.730
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

5538
02:48:32.730 --> 02:48:35.460
<v Speaker 5>I try to take anybody as orthodoxy,</v>

5539
02:48:35.461 --> 02:48:39.870
<v Speaker 5>but I find that he's open enough and he's also a lawyer and a doctor too,</v>

5540
02:48:39.880 --> 02:48:41.100
<v Speaker 5>like he's trained to be both,</v>

5541
02:48:41.101 --> 02:48:42.540
<v Speaker 5>so he's pretty smart.</v>

5542
02:48:43.050 --> 02:48:43.710
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

5543
02:48:43.710 --> 02:48:47.650
<v Speaker 5>so I like to Dab a devil in his,</v>

5544
02:48:47.680 --> 02:48:51.060
<v Speaker 5>his work and same with Sargon and a contact lead.</v>

5545
02:48:51.120 --> 02:48:53.070
<v Speaker 5>Then there's this guy just started listening to a shirt,</v>

5546
02:48:53.310 --> 02:48:53.641
<v Speaker 5>shirt,</v>

5547
02:48:53.641 --> 02:48:54.560
<v Speaker 5>fat attackers,</v>

5548
02:48:54.570 --> 02:48:55.403
<v Speaker 5>a Canadian guy.</v>

5549
02:48:56.220 --> 02:48:56.710
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

5550
02:48:56.710 --> 02:48:57.630
<v Speaker 5>he mostly does gaming,</v>

5551
02:48:57.631 --> 02:49:00.960
<v Speaker 5>but he does like a at d and d stream with a v and Sargon.</v>

5552
02:49:00.961 --> 02:49:05.490
<v Speaker 5>So I listened to that too because now he usually has stuff inside this.</v>

5553
02:49:05.491 --> 02:49:06.324
<v Speaker 5>Interesting.</v>

5554
02:49:07.750 --> 02:49:07.990
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

5555
02:49:07.990 --> 02:49:08.780
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

5556
02:49:08.780 --> 02:49:08.950
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

5557
02:49:08.950 --> 02:49:09.783
<v Speaker 5>so those are,</v>

5558
02:49:09.800 --> 02:49:11.890
<v Speaker 5>some of the guys listen to also listen to Owen Benjamin,</v>

5559
02:49:11.891 --> 02:49:14.260
<v Speaker 5>who's kind of been a weird lately.</v>

5560
02:49:14.620 --> 02:49:15.453
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

5561
02:49:15.940 --> 02:49:16.773
<v Speaker 5>I found him,</v>

5562
02:49:17.200 --> 02:49:18.340
<v Speaker 5>I love his comedy.</v>

5563
02:49:18.341 --> 02:49:19.930
<v Speaker 5>I think he's fucking hilarious,</v>

5564
02:49:20.110 --> 02:49:22.540
<v Speaker 5>but he's got a little bit weird with the,</v>

5565
02:49:23.170 --> 02:49:24.060
<v Speaker 5>the uh,</v>

5566

<v Speaker 5>what is it</v>

5567
02:49:26.140 --> 02:49:27.580
<v Speaker 5>about the moon landing stuff?</v>

5568
02:49:27.581 --> 02:49:28.620
<v Speaker 5>And now he's onto him.</v>

5569
02:49:28.690 --> 02:49:30.820
<v Speaker 5>I think he's six months from flat earth,</v>

5570
02:49:30.821 --> 02:49:31.840
<v Speaker 5>but who knows?</v>

5571
02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:32.570
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

5572
02:49:32.570 --> 02:49:33.250

5573
02:49:33.250 --> 02:49:33.721
<v Speaker 5>my guest.</v>

5574
02:49:33.721 --> 02:49:34.554
<v Speaker 5>I could be wrong.</v>

5575
02:49:34.720 --> 02:49:34.950
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

5576
02:49:34.950 --> 02:49:37.840
<v Speaker 5>you also could just be fucking with everybody because that's the way it is.</v>

5577
02:49:37.950 --> 02:49:38.350
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

5578
02:49:38.350 --> 02:49:40.120
<v Speaker 5>I've thought that for a little while.</v>

5579
02:49:40.121 --> 02:49:40.390
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

5580
02:49:40.390 --> 02:49:40.830
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

5581
02:49:40.830 --> 02:49:43.650
<v Speaker 5>we never know really exactly what anybody's doing a.</v>

5582
02:49:43.920 --> 02:49:44.291
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

5583
02:49:44.291 --> 02:49:46.140
<v Speaker 5>you got youtube and you know,</v>

5584
02:49:46.330 --> 02:49:49.510
<v Speaker 5>don't ever know what direction they're moving in and a,</v>

5585
02:49:50.740 --> 02:49:52.300
<v Speaker 5>he could be totally different person and</v>

5586
02:49:52.880 --> 02:49:55.180
<v Speaker 6>no in real life.</v>

5587
02:49:55.290 --> 02:49:56.123
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

5588
02:49:56.380 --> 02:49:58.720
<v Speaker 6>well not what I mean</v>

5589
02:49:59.730 --> 02:50:02.040
<v Speaker 5>when you're not around a camera and an audience.</v>

5590
02:50:02.340 --> 02:50:03.173
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

5591
02:50:05.030 --> 02:50:05.863
<v Speaker 5>I Dunno,</v>

5592
02:50:05.990 --> 02:50:06.970
<v Speaker 5>I've listened to it.</v>

5593
02:50:08.710 --> 02:50:13.710
<v Speaker 5>I've listened to probably a few hours worth of his last few streams and uh,</v>

5594
02:50:17.680 --> 02:50:18.700
<v Speaker 5>I've always thought like,</v>

5595
02:50:18.730 --> 02:50:19.563
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5596
02:50:20.390 --> 02:50:23.500
<v Speaker 5>I don't necessarily think the moon landing was faked,</v>

5597
02:50:23.501 --> 02:50:24.940
<v Speaker 5>but even if it was,</v>

5598
02:50:26.050 --> 02:50:26.883
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5599
02:50:27.120 --> 02:50:28.000
<v Speaker 5>if it was,</v>

5600
02:50:28.001 --> 02:50:28.570
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't,</v>

5601
02:50:28.570 --> 02:50:31.540
<v Speaker 5>it wouldn't give me any more faith</v>

5602
02:50:32.470 --> 02:50:33.303
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>

5603
02:50:35.020 --> 02:50:35.591
<v Speaker 5>excuse me,</v>

5604
02:50:35.591 --> 02:50:40.300
<v Speaker 5>in the intelligence agencies or the federal government telling you the truth.</v>

5605
02:50:41.260 --> 02:50:42.610
<v Speaker 5>I mean already,</v>

5606
02:50:42.670 --> 02:50:43.001
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5607
02:50:43.001 --> 02:50:43.834
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

5608
02:50:44.560 --> 02:50:46.030
<v Speaker 5>the state is there to,</v>

5609
02:50:46.190 --> 02:50:47.023
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5610
02:50:48.450 --> 02:50:50.820
<v Speaker 5>in its capacity now is there to deceive.</v>

5611
02:50:50.910 --> 02:50:51.743
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

5612
02:50:52.140 --> 02:50:55.920
<v Speaker 5>doesn't want people to know the state of war.</v>

5613
02:50:56.520 --> 02:50:57.353
<v Speaker 5>The state of,</v>

5614
02:50:57.440 --> 02:50:58.230
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5615
02:50:58.230 --> 02:50:59.940
<v Speaker 5>made that mistake in Vietnam.</v>

5616
02:51:00.870 --> 02:51:01.280
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

5617
02:51:01.280 --> 02:51:01.650
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5618
02:51:01.650 --> 02:51:06.210
<v Speaker 5>showing the effects of a war on TV,</v>

5619
02:51:06.211 --> 02:51:06.510
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5620
02:51:06.510 --> 02:51:07.550
<v Speaker 6>won't happen now,</v>

5621
02:51:09.930 --> 02:51:11.150
<v Speaker 5>but you never hear anything.</v>

5622
02:51:11.180 --> 02:51:12.013
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

5623
02:51:12.580 --> 02:51:13.413
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

5624
02:51:13.690 --> 02:51:14.523
<v Speaker 6>not that</v>

5625
02:51:14.740 --> 02:51:16.870
<v Speaker 5>that's what he's constantly railing about.</v>

5626
02:51:16.930 --> 02:51:17.290
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

5627
02:51:17.290 --> 02:51:17.561
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5628
02:51:17.561 --> 02:51:21.850
<v Speaker 5>the federal government or the intelligence agencies are lying to people in the</v>

5629
02:51:21.851 --> 02:51:22.271
<v Speaker 5>military.</v>

5630
02:51:22.271 --> 02:51:23.650
<v Speaker 5>Industrial Complex is lying.</v>

5631
02:51:23.651 --> 02:51:24.484
<v Speaker 5>That's not what he's going.</v>

5632
02:51:24.570 --> 02:51:27.190
<v Speaker 5>He's going on specifically about the moon landing,</v>

5633
02:51:27.191 --> 02:51:27.910
<v Speaker 5>being fake,</v>

5634
02:51:27.910 --> 02:51:28.091
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

5635
02:51:28.091 --> 02:51:28.924
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5636
02:51:30.150 --> 02:51:31.300
<v Speaker 5>I don't really care how.</v>

5637
02:51:32.240 --> 02:51:32.510
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

5638
02:51:32.510 --> 02:51:33.350
<v Speaker 5>I don't really care you.</v>

5639
02:51:33.470 --> 02:51:34.530
<v Speaker 5>I don't really care either.</v>

5640
02:51:34.610 --> 02:51:34.970
<v Speaker 5>A,</v>

5641
02:51:34.970 --> 02:51:37.440
<v Speaker 5>if you've ever seen the movie interstellar.</v>

5642
02:51:38.530 --> 02:51:39.363
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5643
02:51:39.890 --> 02:51:41.420
<v Speaker 5>Was it the</v>

5644
02:51:43.060 --> 02:51:43.731
<v Speaker 5>Mcconnell here?</v>

5645
02:51:43.731 --> 02:51:44.090
<v Speaker 5>River?</v>

5646
02:51:44.090 --> 02:51:44.301
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5647
02:51:44.301 --> 02:51:44.750
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

5648
02:51:44.750 --> 02:51:44.961
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>

5649
02:51:44.961 --> 02:51:45.794
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5650
02:51:46.010 --> 02:51:49.250
<v Speaker 5>they say in school there that the moon landing was faked just so that they could</v>

5651
02:51:49.251 --> 02:51:52.960
<v Speaker 5>defeat the Russians would expend so many resources that it would cause the</v>

5652
02:51:53.160 --> 02:51:55.220
<v Speaker 5>article apps to try to catch up.</v>

5653
02:51:57.590 --> 02:51:58.423
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5654
02:52:01.680 --> 02:52:03.780
<v Speaker 6>Uh Huh.</v>

5655
02:52:08.050 --> 02:52:08.291
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

5656
02:52:08.291 --> 02:52:08.711
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5657
02:52:08.711 --> 02:52:09.191
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

5658
02:52:09.191 --> 02:52:10.320
<v Speaker 5>I think that's probably bullshit,</v>

5659
02:52:10.360 --> 02:52:10.920
<v Speaker 5>but I,</v>

5660
02:52:10.920 --> 02:52:11.753
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

5661
02:52:11.860 --> 02:52:12.693
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5662
02:52:12.850 --> 02:52:15.220
<v Speaker 5>I think there's enough evidence that we went to the moon to make it.</v>

5663
02:52:16.150 --> 02:52:16.440
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

5664
02:52:16.440 --> 02:52:16.891
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

5665
02:52:16.891 --> 02:52:17.130
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

5666
02:52:17.130 --> 02:52:20.860
<v Speaker 5>I'm willing to entertain the idea that it didn't happen just because I'm open</v>

5667
02:52:20.861 --> 02:52:21.221
<v Speaker 5>minded,</v>

5668
02:52:21.221 --> 02:52:22.160
<v Speaker 5>but um,</v>

5669
02:52:22.690 --> 02:52:24.610
<v Speaker 5>I'm not convinced that it didn't happen,</v>

5670
02:52:24.611 --> 02:52:25.660
<v Speaker 5>so yeah,</v>

5671
02:52:27.070 --> 02:52:28.480
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty convinced to happens.</v>

5672
02:52:28.540 --> 02:52:31.270
<v Speaker 5>But if something popped up and it was,</v>

5673
02:52:31.330 --> 02:52:33.850
<v Speaker 5>I thought it was reasonable evidence and I've considered it.</v>

5674
02:52:33.920 --> 02:52:34.550
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

5675
02:52:34.550 --> 02:52:34.750
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

5676
02:52:34.750 --> 02:52:35.583
<v Speaker 5>I'm not close minded.</v>

5677
02:52:36.440 --> 02:52:37.273
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5678
02:52:38.150 --> 02:52:39.830
<v Speaker 5>Ultimately I think that's all fine.</v>

5679
02:52:39.890 --> 02:52:40.723
<v Speaker 5>I think it's pointless though.</v>

5680
02:52:40.950 --> 02:52:41.783
<v Speaker 5>Gutierrez.</v>

5681
02:52:42.470 --> 02:52:43.303
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5682
02:52:43.310 --> 02:52:43.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5683
02:52:43.970 --> 02:52:44.271
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

5684
02:52:44.271 --> 02:52:45.200
<v Speaker 1>I think there's enough.</v>

5685
02:52:52.250 --> 02:52:53.100
<v Speaker 1>You went blank there,</v>

5686
02:52:53.700 --> 02:52:54.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5687
02:52:54.380 --> 02:52:55.820
<v Speaker 1>Benjamin brings up the.</v>

5688
02:52:56.460 --> 02:52:56.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5689
02:52:56.920 --> 02:52:58.490
<v Speaker 1>all the telemetry data is</v>

5690
02:52:58.800 --> 02:52:59.633
<v Speaker 2>in</v>

5691
02:53:01.560 --> 02:53:02.181
<v Speaker 1>erased,</v>

5692
02:53:02.181 --> 02:53:02.821
<v Speaker 1>deleted.</v>

5693
02:53:02.821 --> 02:53:04.590
<v Speaker 1>The tapes have been written over.</v>

5694
02:53:05.490 --> 02:53:05.731
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

5695
02:53:05.731 --> 02:53:05.881
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

5696
02:53:05.881 --> 02:53:07.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily think that's true.</v>

5697
02:53:07.710 --> 02:53:11.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've definitely found that it is true.</v>

5698
02:53:11.731 --> 02:53:14.070
<v Speaker 1>It's like it could just be like a stupid accident.</v>

5699
02:53:14.071 --> 02:53:19.071
<v Speaker 1>Like I wouldn't put up to malice what can be excused this stupid or it's just</v>

5700
02:53:19.200 --> 02:53:20.130
<v Speaker 1>hired the intern.</v>

5701
02:53:20.131 --> 02:53:21.840
<v Speaker 1>The intern works for free,</v>

5702
02:53:21.860 --> 02:53:23.130
<v Speaker 1>doesn't know what the fuck he's doing.</v>

5703
02:53:23.460 --> 02:53:24.900
<v Speaker 1>Someone tells them to go do something.</v>

5704
02:53:24.901 --> 02:53:26.310
<v Speaker 1>He does it and it's like,</v>

5705
02:53:26.311 --> 02:53:26.491
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

5706
02:53:26.491 --> 02:53:27.324
<v Speaker 1>what did you do?</v>

5707
02:53:30.220 --> 02:53:30.521
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5708
02:53:30.521 --> 02:53:31.001
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

5709
02:53:31.001 --> 02:53:32.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5710
02:53:32.101 --> 02:53:32.934
<v Speaker 1>is the moon</v>

5711
02:53:34.710 --> 02:53:35.750
<v Speaker 1>or a portion of it.</v>

5712
02:53:35.770 --> 02:53:36.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5713
02:53:36.160 --> 02:53:36.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5714
02:53:36.430 --> 02:53:38.020
<v Speaker 1>Or a portion of it and it's like,</v>

5715
02:53:38.021 --> 02:53:38.410
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

5716
02:53:38.410 --> 02:53:40.220
<v Speaker 1>let's just say it's all gone now.</v>

5717
02:53:40.360 --> 02:53:41.193
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

5718
02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:42.910
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't my 19,</v>

5719
02:53:42.911 --> 02:53:46.890
<v Speaker 1>96 Christmas recording on the vcr of home alone too.</v>

5720
02:53:47.060 --> 02:53:47.670
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

5721
02:53:47.670 --> 02:53:49.720
<v Speaker 1>it was the fucking moon landing.</v>

5722
02:53:49.920 --> 02:53:50.620
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

5723
02:53:50.620 --> 02:53:51.453
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5724
02:53:51.550 --> 02:53:51.881
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

5725
02:53:51.881 --> 02:53:54.730
<v Speaker 1>And that's the thing is that the right hand never knows what the left hand's</v>

5726
02:53:54.731 --> 02:53:55.540
<v Speaker 1>doing it in,</v>

5727
02:53:55.540 --> 02:53:55.781
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5728
02:53:55.781 --> 02:53:57.010
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to the federal government.</v>

5729
02:53:57.250 --> 02:53:58.120
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

5730
02:53:58.600 --> 02:54:02.140
<v Speaker 1>it's like don't think for a second that you can put,</v>

5731
02:54:02.940 --> 02:54:03.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5732
02:54:03.580 --> 02:54:06.160
<v Speaker 1>government and competency in the same,</v>

5733
02:54:07.180 --> 02:54:08.013
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5734
02:54:08.080 --> 02:54:10.240
<v Speaker 1>in the same sentence.</v>

5735
02:54:10.450 --> 02:54:11.283
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

5736
02:54:12.270 --> 02:54:13.060
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

5737
02:54:13.060 --> 02:54:13.590
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

5738
02:54:13.590 --> 02:54:14.000
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

5739
02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:14.833
<v Speaker 1>it's like</v>

5740
02:54:14.920 --> 02:54:15.230
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

5741
02:54:15.230 --> 02:54:19.680
<v Speaker 5>I work for the government and we order like gloves that are there.</v>

5742
02:54:20.300 --> 02:54:21.430
<v Speaker 5>They are come with a number,</v>

5743
02:54:21.431 --> 02:54:21.641
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

5744
02:54:21.641 --> 02:54:23.200
<v Speaker 5>So you write down the number,</v>

5745
02:54:23.620 --> 02:54:23.861
<v Speaker 5>you say,</v>

5746
02:54:23.861 --> 02:54:25.810
<v Speaker 5>I need this club from this company,</v>

5747
02:54:26.010 --> 02:54:28.090
<v Speaker 5>this number because it meets all the standards.</v>

5748
02:54:28.110 --> 02:54:28.943
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

5749
02:54:29.200 --> 02:54:31.330
<v Speaker 5>And then they bring in these clubs and the guidance.</v>

5750
02:54:31.710 --> 02:54:33.330
<v Speaker 5>You just looked at a picture or something.</v>

5751
02:54:33.340 --> 02:54:35.620
<v Speaker 5>Then you've got the goals that weren't met or didn't meet the standard.</v>

5752
02:54:35.621 --> 02:54:36.790
<v Speaker 5>So I got my work,</v>

5753
02:54:36.791 --> 02:54:38.800
<v Speaker 5>puts his hands in chromic acid,</v>

5754
02:54:39.220 --> 02:54:42.310
<v Speaker 5>it leaks through and gets all over his skin and burns the shit out of his hand</v>

5755
02:54:43.150 --> 02:54:46.510
<v Speaker 5>and it's because of the day went and bought the glove that looked like it,</v>

5756
02:54:46.511 --> 02:54:47.344
<v Speaker 5>but it's not the,</v>

5757
02:54:47.370 --> 02:54:48.640
<v Speaker 5>it's not the specific number,</v>

5758
02:54:48.760 --> 02:54:50.050
<v Speaker 5>but we told them which one to get,</v>

5759
02:54:50.140 --> 02:54:54.310
<v Speaker 5>but they go ahead and pass down through like four more people before it.</v>

5760
02:54:54.311 --> 02:54:54.641
<v Speaker 5>Finally,</v>

5761
02:54:54.641 --> 02:54:55.960
<v Speaker 5>the guy that actually orders it,</v>

5762
02:54:56.500 --> 02:55:00.850
<v Speaker 5>then he doesn't eat so disconnected from the bottom of the pyramid there that he</v>

5763
02:55:00.851 --> 02:55:01.810
<v Speaker 5>doesn't know the difference.</v>

5764
02:55:01.811 --> 02:55:04.010
<v Speaker 5>So we end up getting fucked over a lot.</v>

5765
02:55:04.170 --> 02:55:08.960
<v Speaker 1>That's the procurement of basic supplies with the government is ridiculously</v>

5766
02:55:09.950 --> 02:55:10.783
<v Speaker 1>convoluted.</v>

5767
02:55:10.910 --> 02:55:12.380
<v Speaker 1>Like it shouldn't be,</v>

5768
02:55:12.500 --> 02:55:13.070
<v Speaker 1>but it is.</v>

5769
02:55:13.070 --> 02:55:14.600
<v Speaker 1>It's funny because I was thinking,</v>

5770
02:55:15.100 --> 02:55:15.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5771
02:55:15.710 --> 02:55:16.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5772
02:55:16.010 --> 02:55:19.670
<v Speaker 1>it's still in the back of my mind going into the air force into a contracting,</v>

5773
02:55:19.910 --> 02:55:21.560
<v Speaker 1>which is basically the guy who.</v>

5774
02:55:22.010 --> 02:55:22.221
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5775
02:55:22.221 --> 02:55:25.970
<v Speaker 1>that's what I would want to do because it has the best when you get out of the</v>

5776
02:55:26.210 --> 02:55:27.890
<v Speaker 1>military as one of the best.</v>

5777
02:55:29.490 --> 02:55:30.323
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

5778
02:55:31.270 --> 02:55:33.370
<v Speaker 1>Returns I guess in the civilian world.</v>

5779
02:55:33.371 --> 02:55:33.611
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5780
02:55:33.611 --> 02:55:33.790
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

5781
02:55:33.790 --> 02:55:38.650
<v Speaker 1>you can walk out of the military Friday and on Monday walk in as a,</v>

5782
02:55:39.280 --> 02:55:41.770
<v Speaker 1>basically you have a job almost immediately in contracting,</v>

5783
02:55:42.970 --> 02:55:43.311
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

5784
02:55:43.311 --> 02:55:44.350
<v Speaker 1>it was one of the same thing.</v>

5785
02:55:44.910 --> 02:55:46.120
<v Speaker 7>But um,</v>

5786
02:55:47.500 --> 02:55:48.333
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

5787
02:55:48.730 --> 02:55:52.900
<v Speaker 1>so that sucks that because you know,</v>

5788
02:55:52.901 --> 02:55:53.734
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

5789
02:55:54.550 --> 02:55:56.410
<v Speaker 1>it has to go through so many people that,</v>

5790
02:55:56.460 --> 02:55:56.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5791
02:55:56.860 --> 02:55:58.870
<v Speaker 1>people end up getting hurt over it.</v>

5792
02:56:02.170 --> 02:56:03.003
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5793
02:56:03.420 --> 02:56:04.253
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

5794
02:56:04.870 --> 02:56:05.703
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

5795
02:56:08.200 --> 02:56:09.033
<v Speaker 1>but you know.</v>

5796
02:56:10.150 --> 02:56:10.983
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5797
02:56:11.280 --> 02:56:12.070
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

5798
02:56:12.070 --> 02:56:12.500
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

5799
02:56:12.500 --> 02:56:13.030
<v Speaker 1>how are you,</v>

5800
02:56:13.030 --> 02:56:14.830
<v Speaker 1>how are your drinking laws in Florida?</v>

5801
02:56:14.850 --> 02:56:17.620
<v Speaker 1>Like do you like to walk around with a beer in hand or how's that work?</v>

5802
02:56:19.050 --> 02:56:19.883
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

5803
02:56:21.460 --> 02:56:24.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you got to grab a beer and walk down the street and a cop sees</v>

5804
02:56:24.861 --> 02:56:24.980
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

5805
02:56:24.980 --> 02:56:25.820
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to care.</v>

5806
02:56:25.821 --> 02:56:26.654
<v Speaker 1>They're going to care.</v>

5807
02:56:27.740 --> 02:56:28.071
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5808
02:56:28.071 --> 02:56:29.690
<v Speaker 1>I think you're going to care.</v>

5809
02:56:30.010 --> 02:56:30.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5810
02:56:30.740 --> 02:56:34.700
<v Speaker 1>and there are actually some dry.</v>

5811
02:56:36.300 --> 02:56:38.600
<v Speaker 1>There are some dry counties,</v>

5812
02:56:38.840 --> 02:56:39.980
<v Speaker 1>I think there in Alabama,</v>

5813
02:56:39.990 --> 02:56:40.823
<v Speaker 1>not too far from it</v>

5814
02:56:41.110 --> 02:56:41.943
<v Speaker 7>here.</v>

5815
02:56:44.160 --> 02:56:45.630
<v Speaker 1>It means he can't even have a beer at home.</v>

5816
02:56:46.440 --> 02:56:46.741
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5817
02:56:46.741 --> 02:56:48.300
<v Speaker 1>it means you can't buy alcohol.</v>

5818
02:56:48.370 --> 02:56:49.210
<v Speaker 1>Uh Oh,</v>

5819
02:56:51.310 --> 02:56:51.980
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>

5820
02:56:51.980 --> 02:56:52.390
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5821
02:56:52.390 --> 02:56:53.223
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>

5822
02:56:53.930 --> 02:56:54.710
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5823
02:56:54.710 --> 02:56:55.730
<v Speaker 1>when I looked at it,</v>

5824
02:56:55.750 --> 02:56:57.340
<v Speaker 1>it might just be on the weekends,</v>

5825
02:56:57.341 --> 02:56:58.174
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

5826
02:56:58.210 --> 02:56:59.920
<v Speaker 1>for some reason I remember that actually.</v>

5827
02:57:00.310 --> 02:57:03.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean it may be that there's dry counties for some reason.</v>

5828
02:57:03.131 --> 02:57:07.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm remembering having the conversations with some coworkers because,</v>

5829
02:57:07.600 --> 02:57:07.811
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5830
02:57:07.811 --> 02:57:08.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of new here.</v>

5831
02:57:08.861 --> 02:57:13.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean the part of the reason that I've not necessarily just doing the youtube</v>

5832
02:57:13.391 --> 02:57:17.950
<v Speaker 1>thing but kind of on here is I haven't really made that many friends here,</v>

5833
02:57:17.951 --> 02:57:18.281
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5834
02:57:18.281 --> 02:57:20.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't really go out and do that much.</v>

5835
02:57:20.591 --> 02:57:23.280
<v Speaker 1>So that's tough when he moved to a new area.</v>

5836
02:57:23.430 --> 02:57:23.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5837
02:57:23.920 --> 02:57:27.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the Internet a whole lot more and uh,</v>

5838
02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:28.211
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5839
02:57:28.211 --> 02:57:31.310
<v Speaker 1>so they're telling me about some of these areas and yet I don't,</v>

5840
02:57:31.340 --> 02:57:32.500
<v Speaker 1>I think in this town,</v>

5841
02:57:32.960 --> 02:57:33.793
<v Speaker 1>crestview,</v>

5842
02:57:34.270 --> 02:57:35.440
<v Speaker 1>and I think maybe in,</v>

5843
02:57:35.530 --> 02:57:36.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's all Florida,</v>

5844
02:57:36.731 --> 02:57:40.870
<v Speaker 1>that probably just the county that you can't buy alcohol</v>

5845
02:57:42.830 --> 02:57:47.830
<v Speaker 1>past a certain time and you can't buy alcohol on Sundays.</v>

5846
02:57:53.560 --> 02:57:54.393
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

5847
02:57:54.580 --> 02:57:55.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5848
02:57:55.340 --> 02:57:56.021
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>

5849
02:57:56.021 --> 02:57:57.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't drink that much anyway.</v>

5850
02:57:57.191 --> 02:57:57.460
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5851
02:57:57.460 --> 02:58:00.550
<v Speaker 1>like every once in awhile when I was in Chicago,</v>

5852
02:58:00.551 --> 02:58:00.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5853
02:58:00.810 --> 02:58:03.450
<v Speaker 1>we'd to nice restaurants and they'd serve,</v>

5854
02:58:03.500 --> 02:58:04.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5855
02:58:04.050 --> 02:58:09.050
<v Speaker 1>nice craft beer and you drink a pint of something that's $20 and you think it's</v>

5856
02:58:10.441 --> 02:58:12.180
<v Speaker 1>overpriced and then you taste it and it's like,</v>

5857
02:58:12.181 --> 02:58:12.850
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

5858
02:58:12.850 --> 02:58:14.130
<v Speaker 1>turn hardly tastes like beer.</v>

5859
02:58:14.131 --> 02:58:18.660
<v Speaker 1>And it's like the $20 was worth it and you never tasted that again.</v>

5860
02:58:18.690 --> 02:58:18.901
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5861
02:58:18.901 --> 02:58:22.820
<v Speaker 1>you definitely not going to get any domestic shit that.</v>

5862
02:58:24.190 --> 02:58:24.330
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

5863
02:58:24.330 --> 02:58:26.410
<v Speaker 5>I don't really integrate too much.</v>

5864
02:58:27.160 --> 02:58:27.330
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

5865
02:58:27.330 --> 02:58:27.640
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>

5866
02:58:27.640 --> 02:58:29.350
<v Speaker 5>I usually just have a beer.</v>

5867
02:58:29.351 --> 02:58:30.610
<v Speaker 5>It's like after the hockey game,</v>

5868
02:58:30.720 --> 02:58:32.230
<v Speaker 5>here's a beer after a game,</v>

5869
02:58:32.270 --> 02:58:34.450
<v Speaker 5>like it's like drinking gold to say,</v>

5870
02:58:35.900 --> 02:58:37.130
<v Speaker 5>I kind of described under the word.</v>

5871
02:58:37.140 --> 02:58:39.850
<v Speaker 5>I remember the first time I played a soccer game,</v>

5872
02:58:40.480 --> 02:58:41.440
<v Speaker 5>they had a beer after,</v>

5873
02:58:41.441 --> 02:58:43.370
<v Speaker 5>it was like Canadian Molson Canadian.</v>

5874
02:58:43.490 --> 02:58:44.620
<v Speaker 5>It's absolute garbage.</v>

5875
02:58:44.980 --> 02:58:47.020
<v Speaker 5>And it tasted like heaven.</v>

5876
02:58:47.021 --> 02:58:47.830
<v Speaker 5>Like I was,</v>

5877
02:58:47.830 --> 02:58:50.260
<v Speaker 5>I was drinking like the series of angels,</v>

5878
02:58:50.261 --> 02:58:51.094
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5879
02:58:51.120 --> 02:58:53.800
<v Speaker 5>and it was so fucking refreshing.</v>

5880
02:58:54.240 --> 02:58:54.840
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

5881
02:58:54.840 --> 02:58:57.160
<v Speaker 5>and then so now I appear after every hockey game.</v>

5882
02:58:57.280 --> 02:58:57.850
<v Speaker 5>It makes it,</v>

5883
02:58:57.850 --> 02:59:00.700
<v Speaker 5>makes the game even if you lose or you lose or win,</v>

5884
02:59:00.701 --> 02:59:00.891
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

5885
02:59:00.891 --> 02:59:01.724
<v Speaker 5>it's still good.</v>

5886
02:59:01.800 --> 02:59:02.633
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5887
02:59:03.050 --> 02:59:03.350
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5888
02:59:03.350 --> 02:59:05.320
<v Speaker 5>Beard does taste like socks wet sometimes,</v>

5889
02:59:05.321 --> 02:59:06.430
<v Speaker 5>but if you have some,</v>

5890
02:59:06.490 --> 02:59:07.960
<v Speaker 5>if you have good beer that's not so bad.</v>

5891
02:59:08.220 --> 02:59:08.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5892

5940
03:00:35.911 --> 03:00:36.744
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

5941

03:00:43.620 --> 03:00:44.370
<v Speaker 1>it's worth it.</v>

5947
03:00:44.370 --> 03:00:45.203
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

5948
03:00:47.580 --> 03:00:47.791
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

5949
03:00:47.791 --> 03:00:48.624
<v Speaker 5>it's a,</v>

5950
03:00:49.840 --> 03:00:50.673
<v Speaker 5>we have this,</v>

5951
03:00:50.780 --> 03:00:54.010
<v Speaker 5>we have this kind of cheap used to be really cheap brand called Lucky Logger</v>

<v Speaker 5>which we still have,</v>

5955
03:00:56.661 --> 03:00:58.910

03:00:59.740 --> 03:01:00.640
<v Speaker 5>it's been,</v>

5957
03:01:01.160 --> 03:01:04.360
<v Speaker 5>it got so popular that it kind of moved into the medium price bracket.</v>

5958
03:01:04.361 --> 03:01:05.194
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

5959
03:01:05.470 --> 03:01:08.020
<v Speaker 5>but that's what we have at our games basically every time.</v>

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5964
03:01:18.500 --> 03:01:21.010

03:01:21.040 --> 03:01:22.390
<v Speaker 5>30 racks keystones,</v>

5966
03:01:22.391 --> 03:01:23.224
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5967
03:01:23.940 --> 03:01:25.530
<v Speaker 5>I mean is what you do at colleges,</v>

5968
03:01:25.570 --> 03:01:25.790
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5969
03:01:25.790 --> 03:01:29.860
<v Speaker 5>you go to a big college parties and do the cheapest shit you can.</v>

5970
03:01:29.980 --> 03:01:30.431
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5971
03:01:30.431 --> 03:01:32.230
<v Speaker 5>Kegs full of the cheapest shit possible.</v>

5972
03:01:32.231 --> 03:01:34.990
<v Speaker 5>Keystone now I used to,</v>

5973
03:01:34.991 --> 03:01:35.550
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5974
03:01:35.550 --> 03:01:36.400
<v Speaker 5>but I'm,</v>

5975
03:01:36.910 --> 03:01:38.020
<v Speaker 5>I'm two years older than my brother,</v>

5976
03:01:38.021 --> 03:01:43.021
<v Speaker 5>so when I turned 19 I forget for him for high school and I'd get like the</v>

5977
03:01:43.841 --> 03:01:44.674
<v Speaker 5>cheapest,</v>

5978
03:01:44.680 --> 03:01:47.740
<v Speaker 5>the cheapest beer with the highest alcohol content and it's called the lucky</v>

5979
03:01:47.741 --> 03:01:48.574
<v Speaker 5>force eight.</v>

5980
03:01:48.630 --> 03:01:49.463
<v Speaker 5>It was like the,</v>

5981
03:01:49.830 --> 03:01:52.240
<v Speaker 5>it was so disgusting like the.</v>

5982
03:01:52.370 --> 03:01:56.620
<v Speaker 5>But he'd bring them to school to the parties and he'd sell them two for five</v>

5983
03:01:56.621 --> 03:01:56.981
<v Speaker 5>bucks,</v>

5984
03:01:56.981 --> 03:02:01.981
<v Speaker 5>which is like if he sold I think 18 of them and the 24 you could get six if you</v>

5985
03:02:03.401 --> 03:02:05.830
<v Speaker 5>had six TV smashed and uh,</v>

5986
03:02:05.950 --> 03:02:08.950
<v Speaker 5>and you could sell the rest and make you pay for all the theory part.</v>

5987
03:02:09.880 --> 03:02:11.560
<v Speaker 5>Have two for five bucks though.</v>

5988
03:02:11.561 --> 03:02:14.080
<v Speaker 5>Is highway a fucking robbery for those beers?</v>

5989
03:02:14.081 --> 03:02:15.370
<v Speaker 5>But I mean the kids,</v>

5990
03:02:15.371 --> 03:02:16.151
<v Speaker 5>they can't get the beer.</v>

5991
03:02:16.151 --> 03:02:17.230
<v Speaker 5>So it's like you.</v>

5992
03:02:18.110 --> 03:02:18.943
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5993
03:02:21.170 --> 03:02:21.750
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

5994
03:02:21.750 --> 03:02:22.320
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

5995
03:02:22.320 --> 03:02:24.270
<v Speaker 5>it was kind of funny but I remember whenever,</v>

5996
03:02:24.370 --> 03:02:26.100
<v Speaker 5>I think I tried one once and it was like,</v>

5997
03:02:26.620 --> 03:02:27.940
<v Speaker 5>like regular lucky,</v>

5998
03:02:28.510 --> 03:02:28.871
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5999
03:02:28.871 --> 03:02:29.561
<v Speaker 5>it's definitely,</v>

6000
03:02:29.561 --> 03:02:30.550
<v Speaker 5>it tastes like beer,</v>

6001
03:02:30.780 --> 03:02:33.970
<v Speaker 5>but like lucky for say like it tastes like horse piss.</v>

6002
03:02:34.100 --> 03:02:34.990
<v Speaker 5>Was it like,</v>

6003
03:02:35.200 --> 03:02:36.200
<v Speaker 5>was it a uh,</v>

6004
03:02:36.400 --> 03:02:37.233
<v Speaker 5>I know we had,</v>

6005
03:02:37.300 --> 03:02:38.770
<v Speaker 5>I don't know about what you're talking about,</v>

6006
03:02:38.771 --> 03:02:40.690
<v Speaker 5>but then we had like steel reserve which was a</v>

6007
03:02:41.620 --> 03:02:42.453
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

6008
03:02:43.870 --> 03:02:45.680
<v Speaker 5>steel reserve was um,</v>

6009
03:02:46.200 --> 03:02:47.390
<v Speaker 5>was the percentage of,</v>

6010
03:02:48.430 --> 03:02:48.970
<v Speaker 5>I dunno,</v>

6011
03:02:48.970 --> 03:02:51.220
<v Speaker 5>but it super cheap.</v>

6012
03:02:51.610 --> 03:02:53.230
<v Speaker 5>I don't know that it was that much higher.</v>

6013
03:02:55.480 --> 03:02:56.290
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

6014
03:02:56.290 --> 03:02:58.120
<v Speaker 5>Well I think there's more liquor.</v>

6015
03:02:58.121 --> 03:02:58.954
<v Speaker 5>We have that too.</v>

6016
03:02:59.170 --> 03:03:02.050
<v Speaker 5>They always get sold out because I'm really close to a native reserve,</v>

6017
03:03:02.530 --> 03:03:02.951
<v Speaker 5>but the,</v>

6018
03:03:02.951 --> 03:03:03.820
<v Speaker 5>so the malt liquor,</v>

6019
03:03:03.821 --> 03:03:08.200
<v Speaker 5>but then there's like the highest beer was the highest grade that was like mass</v>

6020
03:03:08.270 --> 03:03:10.270
<v Speaker 5>produces eight percent here.</v>

6021
03:03:10.690 --> 03:03:11.050
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

6022
03:03:11.050 --> 03:03:13.120
<v Speaker 5>you can get like higher but they're more expensive.</v>

6023
03:03:13.660 --> 03:03:14.493
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

6024
03:03:14.620 --> 03:03:16.630
<v Speaker 5>but just for like the shit beer eight percent.</v>

6025
03:03:16.690 --> 03:03:17.523
<v Speaker 5>And it was like,</v>

6026
03:03:19.310 --> 03:03:21.340
<v Speaker 5>the reserve is like between,</v>

6027
03:03:21.341 --> 03:03:23.740
<v Speaker 5>I'm looking at Google page six and eight,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I had it,</v>

6031
03:03:25.510 --> 03:03:26.343
<v Speaker 5>I tried it,</v>

6032
03:03:26.700 --> 03:03:27.820
<v Speaker 5>we went down to Carbondale,</v>

6033
03:03:27.821 --> 03:03:30.200
<v Speaker 5>which is a huge party college.</v>

6034
03:03:30.201 --> 03:03:30.430
<v Speaker 5>And</v>

<v Speaker 5>it is terrible.</v>

6038
03:03:34.580 --> 03:03:35.760
<v Speaker 5>It was awful.</v>

6039
03:03:37.890 --> 03:03:38.850
<v Speaker 5>And there's nothing else.</v>

6040
03:03:38.851 --> 03:03:39.511
<v Speaker 5>It's whatever.</v>

6041
03:03:39.511 --> 03:03:40.344
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

6042
03:03:44.540 --> 03:03:45.373
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

6043
03:03:45.500 --> 03:03:47.540
<v Speaker 5>you've got to do</v>

6044
03:03:49.270 --> 03:03:52.920
<v Speaker 5>a 1000 miles in Russia when I was like 17,</v>

6045
03:03:52.930 --> 03:03:53.763
<v Speaker 5>there was like,</v>

6046
03:03:53.990 --> 03:03:57.110
<v Speaker 5>if you're thinking you had to be 13 to have fear or something like that when in</v>

6047
03:03:57.120 --> 03:03:57.500
<v Speaker 5>the restroom.</v>

6048
03:03:57.500 --> 03:03:58.430
<v Speaker 5>So I was like 17.</v>

6049
03:03:58.431 --> 03:03:58.970
<v Speaker 5>So it was totally,</v>

6050
03:03:58.970 --> 03:04:01.230
<v Speaker 5>I was like getting an hour and a,</v>

6051
03:04:02.150 --> 03:04:06.950
<v Speaker 5>it's a in this under or in Moscow and it's like this underground pub,</v>

6052
03:04:07.110 --> 03:04:10.250
<v Speaker 5>just like you have to go down into the basement or whatever and it's in there.</v>

6053
03:04:10.790 --> 03:04:11.880
<v Speaker 5>And everyone's smoking,</v>

6054
03:04:11.910 --> 03:04:12.950
<v Speaker 5>like assuming I don't smoke,</v>

6055
03:04:12.951 --> 03:04:14.330
<v Speaker 5>but everyone was smoking like a chimney.</v>

6056
03:04:14.840 --> 03:04:18.380
<v Speaker 5>So the entire place is just absolutely filled with smoke from one end to the</v>

6057
03:04:18.381 --> 03:04:18.740
<v Speaker 5>other.</v>

6058
03:04:18.740 --> 03:04:19.131
<v Speaker 5>You couldn't,</v>

6059
03:04:19.131 --> 03:04:19.330
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

6060
03:04:19.330 --> 03:04:20.210
<v Speaker 5>there's a big long table.</v>

6061
03:04:20.211 --> 03:04:23.180
<v Speaker 5>They were all sitting at the public 20 of us and uh,</v>

6062
03:04:23.181 --> 03:04:24.410
<v Speaker 5>you couldn't see the other end of it.</v>

6063
03:04:24.410 --> 03:04:24.891
<v Speaker 5>And everyone's like,</v>

6064
03:04:24.891 --> 03:04:25.730
<v Speaker 5>smoking like crazy.</v>

6065
03:04:26.180 --> 03:04:26.301
<v Speaker 5>Oh.</v>

6066
03:04:26.301 --> 03:04:27.860
<v Speaker 5>And I went to the Moscow,</v>

6067
03:04:28.640 --> 03:04:29.171
<v Speaker 5>Moscow,</v>

6068
03:04:29.171 --> 03:04:32.000
<v Speaker 5>a circus and the same.</v>

6069
03:04:32.030 --> 03:04:32.601
<v Speaker 5>Same thing.</v>

6070
03:04:32.601 --> 03:04:34.250
<v Speaker 5>You can't smoke inside the building.</v>

6071
03:04:34.460 --> 03:04:35.330
<v Speaker 5>You can only smoke inside.</v>

6072
03:04:35.380 --> 03:04:37.130
<v Speaker 5>The people would ever want to go to the bathrooms.</v>

6073
03:04:37.580 --> 03:04:38.413
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

6074
03:04:38.620 --> 03:04:39.453
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

6075
03:04:39.540 --> 03:04:39.801
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

6076
03:04:39.801 --> 03:04:42.770
<v Speaker 5>how like you go to the bathroom and it's like a physical last story you can see</v>

6077
03:04:42.771 --> 03:04:43.490
<v Speaker 5>through it.</v>

6078
03:04:43.490 --> 03:04:44.510
<v Speaker 5>But this was a glass door,</v>

6079
03:04:44.511 --> 03:04:45.470
<v Speaker 5>but you couldn't see through it.</v>

6080
03:04:45.500 --> 03:04:48.500
<v Speaker 5>It looked like frosted glass because everyone would go in there and smoked their</v>

6081
03:04:48.501 --> 03:04:49.334
<v Speaker 5>brains out.</v>

6082
03:04:49.430 --> 03:04:50.020
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

6083
03:04:50.020 --> 03:04:50.320
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

6084
03:04:50.320 --> 03:04:51.290
<v Speaker 5>and there's no events.</v>

6085
03:04:51.440 --> 03:04:51.920
<v Speaker 5>So you go,</v>

6086
03:04:51.920 --> 03:04:52.910
<v Speaker 5>I had to take a piss.</v>

6087
03:04:52.911 --> 03:04:57.911
<v Speaker 5>So I like fucking held my breath ran in and I went in like showered and cleaned</v>

6088
03:04:58.341 --> 03:04:59.780
<v Speaker 5>and I came out just like Rican,</v>

6089
03:04:59.781 --> 03:05:00.614
<v Speaker 5>like cigarettes.</v>

6090
03:05:00.920 --> 03:05:02.960
<v Speaker 5>And I couldn't hold my breath the whole time.</v>

6091
03:05:02.961 --> 03:05:03.490
<v Speaker 5>I had to,</v>

6092
03:05:03.490 --> 03:05:05.090
<v Speaker 5>I had to take one breath walls in there.</v>

6093
03:05:05.420 --> 03:05:05.931
<v Speaker 5>Oh God.</v>

6094
03:05:05.931 --> 03:05:06.764
<v Speaker 5>It was like roads,</v>

6095
03:05:07.200 --> 03:05:07.950
<v Speaker 5>like sucking,</v>

6096
03:05:07.950 --> 03:05:08.960
<v Speaker 5>sucking on a chimney.</v>

6097
03:05:10.380 --> 03:05:13.070
<v Speaker 5>That was pretty funny.</v>

6098
03:05:14.740 --> 03:05:15.011
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6099
03:05:15.011 --> 03:05:16.930
<v Speaker 4>It's one thing I kind of don't mind.</v>

6100
03:05:16.931 --> 03:05:17.590
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

6101
03:05:17.590 --> 03:05:18.850
<v Speaker 4>in the Chicago land area,</v>

6102
03:05:18.851 --> 03:05:19.091
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6103
03:05:19.091 --> 03:05:19.870
<v Speaker 4>you can't smoke.</v>

6104
03:05:19.870 --> 03:05:20.081
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

6105
03:05:20.081 --> 03:05:22.330
<v Speaker 4>it's gotten worse and worse and for people who smoked,</v>

6106
03:05:22.331 --> 03:05:22.901
<v Speaker 4>they ate it,</v>

6107
03:05:22.901 --> 03:05:23.734
<v Speaker 4>but it was,</v>

6108
03:05:23.980 --> 03:05:25.480
<v Speaker 4>you can't smoke inside of a building,</v>

6109
03:05:25.481 --> 03:05:27.660
<v Speaker 4>you can't smoke within 20 feet of the building.</v>

6110
03:05:27.661 --> 03:05:31.540
<v Speaker 4>You can't smoke within 50 or 100 because buildings are like,</v>

6111
03:05:31.890 --> 03:05:32.081
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

6112
03:05:32.081 --> 03:05:32.251
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>

6113
03:05:32.251 --> 03:05:37.250
<v Speaker 4>you just can't smoke in Chicago because buildings are only 50 feet from you.</v>

6114
03:05:38.640 --> 03:05:39.230
<v Speaker 4>Same here.</v>

6115
03:05:39.230 --> 03:05:43.400
<v Speaker 5>You can't smoke within 10 feet of a 30 feet.</v>

6116
03:05:43.401 --> 03:05:45.920
<v Speaker 5>Now have like a door or an entrance or a window.</v>

6117
03:05:46.300 --> 03:05:46.760
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6118
03:05:46.760 --> 03:05:51.350
<v Speaker 5>So that basically you have to stand on the yellow line in the middle of the road</v>

6119
03:05:51.440 --> 03:05:52.273
<v Speaker 5>if you want to smoke.</v>

6120
03:05:52.280 --> 03:05:53.113
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

6121
03:05:54.170 --> 03:05:54.500
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

6122
03:05:54.500 --> 03:05:55.333
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>

6123
03:05:55.910 --> 03:05:57.310
<v Speaker 4>I shouldn't be against it.</v>

6124
03:05:57.470 --> 03:05:59.360
<v Speaker 4>You principle of freedom,</v>

6125
03:05:59.361 --> 03:06:00.620
<v Speaker 4>but I hate smoking.</v>

6126
03:06:02.120 --> 03:06:02.953
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

6127
03:06:05.580 --> 03:06:07.860
<v Speaker 5>It's just like a weird.</v>

6128
03:06:07.930 --> 03:06:08.431
<v Speaker 5>I don't care,</v>

6129
03:06:08.431 --> 03:06:10.730
<v Speaker 5>but like tobacco and it seems pointless to me.</v>

6130
03:06:10.740 --> 03:06:11.530
<v Speaker 5>It's just like,</v>

6131
03:06:11.530 --> 03:06:12.410
<v Speaker 5>it smells bad,</v>

6132
03:06:12.430 --> 03:06:13.380
<v Speaker 5>makes you smell bad.</v>

6133
03:06:13.980 --> 03:06:14.813
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

6134
03:06:14.840 --> 03:06:16.350
<v Speaker 5>it gives you cancer.</v>

6135
03:06:16.380 --> 03:06:18.710
<v Speaker 5>I've had family members die of cancer and just like a,</v>

6136
03:06:18.840 --> 03:06:19.673
<v Speaker 5>it's.</v>

6137
03:06:19.830 --> 03:06:20.640
<v Speaker 5>And they all smoke.</v>

6138
03:06:20.640 --> 03:06:21.060
<v Speaker 5>They usually,</v>

6139
03:06:21.060 --> 03:06:22.350
<v Speaker 5>they smoke the most of their lives.</v>

6140
03:06:23.490 --> 03:06:24.750
<v Speaker 5>It's just watching that.</v>

6141
03:06:24.751 --> 03:06:25.321
<v Speaker 5>It's just brutal.</v>

6142
03:06:25.321 --> 03:06:26.154
<v Speaker 5>So I don't know.</v>

6143
03:06:26.760 --> 03:06:31.200
<v Speaker 4>It'd be one thing if people grew tobacco theirself and then dried it and rolled</v>

6144
03:06:31.201 --> 03:06:31.321
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

6145
03:06:31.321 --> 03:06:32.071
<v Speaker 4>but who does that?</v>

6146
03:06:32.071 --> 03:06:34.120
<v Speaker 4>Nobody knows.</v>

6147
03:06:34.140 --> 03:06:36.210
<v Speaker 4>Illegal for too much.</v>

6148
03:06:36.211 --> 03:06:37.340
<v Speaker 4>A pain in the ass to Bravo.</v>

6149
03:06:37.350 --> 03:06:38.183
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6150
03:06:38.730 --> 03:06:40.740
<v Speaker 4>It'd probably be a whole lot more healthy for you,</v>

6151
03:06:40.741 --> 03:06:41.491
<v Speaker 4>but you did it that way.</v>

6152
03:06:41.491 --> 03:06:41.940
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

6153
03:06:41.940 --> 03:06:42.773
<v Speaker 4>combusting,</v>

6154
03:06:43.500 --> 03:06:44.101
<v Speaker 4>combusting,</v>

6155
03:06:44.101 --> 03:06:45.180

03:06:50.340 --> 03:06:54.960
<v Speaker 4>we'll combine that physical process of burning.</v>

6161
03:06:55.740 --> 03:06:56.310
<v Speaker 4>Is</v>

6162

03:07:12.801 --> 03:07:13.400
<v Speaker 3>it's just that because,</v>

6177
03:07:13.400 --> 03:07:13.630
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6178
03:07:13.630 --> 03:07:14.080
<v Speaker 3>I guess,</v>

6179
03:07:14.080 --> 03:07:14.913
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

6180
03:07:15.610 --> 03:07:18.780
<v Speaker 3>like when you break those carbon bonds and burning it.</v>

6181
03:07:19.300 --> 03:07:19.470
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

6182

<v Speaker 3>you're explaining to me.</v>

6184
03:07:21.140 --> 03:07:21.291
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

03:07:21.291 --> 03:07:24.800
<v Speaker 3>would I didn't understand what happens through the admission process.</v>

6186
03:07:24.920 --> 03:07:25.753
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

03:07:26.720 --> 03:07:26.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6188
03:07:26.990 --> 03:07:31.990
<v Speaker 3>The carbon bonds break and I'm at reaction creates like,</v>

6189
03:07:33.770 --> 03:07:35.900
<v Speaker 3>it releases carcinogens basically.</v>

6190
03:07:36.270 --> 03:07:39.050
<v Speaker 3>But that's how I felt.</v>

6191
03:07:39.051 --> 03:07:39.980
<v Speaker 3>That's what I was told anyways.</v>

6192
03:07:40.020 --> 03:07:40.670
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I could,</v>

6193
03:07:40.670 --> 03:07:41.420
<v Speaker 3>I could be wrong.</v>

6194
03:07:41.420 --> 03:07:42.180
<v Speaker 3>I could be bullshitting.</v>

6195
03:07:42.180 --> 03:07:42.391
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

6196
03:07:42.391 --> 03:07:42.710
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

6197
03:07:42.710 --> 03:07:43.120
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

6198
03:07:43.120 --> 03:07:43.953
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to,</v>

6199
03:07:44.090 --> 03:07:44.641
<v Speaker 3>like if I,</v>

6200
03:07:44.641 --> 03:07:44.990
<v Speaker 3>if I'm,</v>

6203
03:07:48.030 --> 03:07:48.920
<v Speaker 3>that's what I was told.</v>

6204
03:07:48.980 --> 03:07:49.813
<v Speaker 3>I could be wrong.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

6210
03:07:55.910 --> 03:07:59.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean if I didn't do that I probably wouldn't have said it</v>

6211
03:08:00.770 --> 03:08:03.770
<v Speaker 3>more than just my own personal stories during this whole thing.</v>

6212
03:08:03.771 --> 03:08:04.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

6213
03:08:04.250 --> 03:08:04.820
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

6214
03:08:04.820 --> 03:08:07.850
<v Speaker 3>you've contributed probably 90 percent of this,</v>

6215
03:08:09.050 --> 03:08:09.883
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

6216
03:08:09.900 --> 03:08:10.733
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

6217
03:08:11.760 --> 03:08:12.593
<v Speaker 3>I'll try,</v>

6218
03:08:12.650 --> 03:08:13.520
<v Speaker 3>I'll try my best,</v>

6219
03:08:15.520 --> 03:08:16.940
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know.</v>

6220
03:08:16.941 --> 03:08:17.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

6221
03:08:17.180 --> 03:08:19.100
<v Speaker 3>he's not upset about smoking.</v>

6222
03:08:19.340 --> 03:08:22.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean I find it kind of interesting that Nazi Germany band,</v>

6223
03:08:23.210 --> 03:08:24.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously the SS and</v>

6224
03:08:25.180 --> 03:08:26.013
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

6225
03:08:26.460 --> 03:08:28.320
<v Speaker 1>probably they kinda didn't care.</v>

6226
03:08:28.321 --> 03:08:31.350
<v Speaker 1>So in the beginning didn't care so much about their own smoking,</v>

6227
03:08:31.351 --> 03:08:32.184
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

6228
03:08:33.540 --> 03:08:33.891
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

6229
03:08:33.891 --> 03:08:35.400
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was banned in Germany.</v>

6230
03:08:36.520 --> 03:08:38.700
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure I've been reading too that I think they did.</v>

6231
03:08:38.970 --> 03:08:39.790
<v Speaker 3>I think the worst.</v>

6232
03:08:39.790 --> 03:08:42.270
<v Speaker 3>There's videos or movies that have them smoking,</v>

6233
03:08:42.271 --> 03:08:44.010
<v Speaker 3>so maybe they're not accurate,</v>

6234
03:08:44.011 --> 03:08:44.970
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know.</v>

6235
03:08:45.660 --> 03:08:46.493
<v Speaker 3>I haven't looked into it.</v>

6236
03:08:46.710 --> 03:08:47.543
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

6237
03:08:48.510 --> 03:08:51.270
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't doubt like those people with those ideas,</v>

6238
03:08:51.530 --> 03:08:53.610
<v Speaker 3>but back then they thought smoking was healthy for,</v>

6239
03:08:53.611 --> 03:08:54.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6240
03:08:54.440 --> 03:08:54.830
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

6241
03:08:54.830 --> 03:08:55.090
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

6242
03:08:55.090 --> 03:08:55.923
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>

6243
03:08:56.010 --> 03:09:01.010
<v Speaker 3>I think that there were studies done a clear clinical trials that doctors had</v>

6244
03:09:03.631 --> 03:09:05.730
<v Speaker 3>done and they had determined that it was,</v>

6245
03:09:06.710 --> 03:09:07.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6246
03:09:07.370 --> 03:09:09.860
<v Speaker 1>that it was unhealthy and then it was just band.</v>

6247
03:09:11.720 --> 03:09:12.050
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

6248
03:09:12.050 --> 03:09:12.740
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

6249
03:09:12.740 --> 03:09:17.240
<v Speaker 3>Well I know what I mean in the 19 fifties they would like tell my grandmother</v>

6250
03:09:17.360 --> 03:09:20.890
<v Speaker 3>that smoking was good for the baby because what it was,</v>

6251
03:09:20.891 --> 03:09:21.500
<v Speaker 3>was he like,</v>

6252
03:09:21.500 --> 03:09:21.920
<v Speaker 3>or no,</v>

6253
03:09:21.920 --> 03:09:22.731
<v Speaker 3>not when they're pregnant,</v>

6254
03:09:22.731 --> 03:09:26.000
<v Speaker 3>but it was good to smoke when you weren't pregnant because you'd be breathing in</v>

6255
03:09:26.001 --> 03:09:29.600
<v Speaker 3>the smoke and then when you breathe out it would take their theory was that it</v>

6256
03:09:29.601 --> 03:09:31.820
<v Speaker 3>would take all the bad bugs and stuff with it,</v>

6257
03:09:31.821 --> 03:09:32.900
<v Speaker 3>like the viruses and stuff.</v>

6258
03:09:33.110 --> 03:09:34.040
<v Speaker 3>But it's total bullshit.</v>

6259
03:09:34.041 --> 03:09:35.250
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

6260
03:09:35.530 --> 03:09:35.750
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

6261
03:09:35.750 --> 03:09:37.010
<v Speaker 3>the idea is kind of funny,</v>

6262
03:09:37.070 --> 03:09:40.580
<v Speaker 3>like it would use to recommend smoking the people for their health.</v>

6263
03:09:40.850 --> 03:09:41.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6264
03:09:41.650 --> 03:09:42.483
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6265
03:09:44.090 --> 03:09:46.970
<v Speaker 3>I guess because maybe because they would get so sick when they stopped that they</v>

6266
03:09:47.030 --> 03:09:47.990
<v Speaker 3>think maybe that was like,</v>

6267
03:09:48.040 --> 03:09:51.680
<v Speaker 3>and they were just like desperately clinging to life because of the cigarettes.</v>

6268
03:09:55.290 --> 03:09:56.770
<v Speaker 5>It's definitely a possibility,</v>

6269
03:09:58.540 --> 03:09:59.860
<v Speaker 5>a cursory.</v>

6270
03:10:02.270 --> 03:10:07.210
<v Speaker 5>But I'm going to have to get going here because it's 2:00 now and I'm getting</v>

6271
03:10:07.211 --> 03:10:08.044
<v Speaker 5>pretty tired.</v>

6272
03:10:08.380 --> 03:10:08.701
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

6273
03:10:08.701 --> 03:10:09.940
<v Speaker 5>Twelve o'clock here.</v>

6274
03:10:10.530 --> 03:10:11.560
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty tired too.</v>

6275
03:10:11.561 --> 03:10:12.180
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>

6276
03:10:12.180 --> 03:10:12.530
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

6277
03:10:12.530 --> 03:10:13.960
<v Speaker 5>it was good chocolate talking with you,</v>

6278
03:10:13.961 --> 03:10:14.794
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

6279
03:10:15.010 --> 03:10:15.580
<v Speaker 5>You do?</v>

6280
03:10:15.580 --> 03:10:16.150
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

6281
03:10:16.150 --> 03:10:17.470
<v Speaker 5>I'm down for doing it again if you're,</v>

6282
03:10:17.650 --> 03:10:18.820
<v Speaker 5>if you still want to do it again,</v>

6283
03:10:18.860 --> 03:10:21.040
<v Speaker 5>so let me know and I'll definitely,</v>

6284
03:10:21.041 --> 03:10:21.720
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

6285
03:10:21.720 --> 03:10:23.800
<v Speaker 5>try and construct more,</v>

6286
03:10:24.120 --> 03:10:24.760
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

6287
03:10:24.760 --> 03:10:26.470
<v Speaker 5>for next time.</v>

6288
03:10:27.120 --> 03:10:27.953
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

6289
03:10:28.350 --> 03:10:29.183
<v Speaker 2>so I kinda know,</v>

6290
03:10:31.150 --> 03:10:31.480
<v Speaker 5>so.</v>

6291
03:10:31.480 --> 03:10:32.160
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

6292
03:10:32.160 --> 03:10:32.993
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

6293
03:10:33.130 --> 03:10:33.310
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

6294
03:10:33.310 --> 03:10:34.060
<v Speaker 5>no worries at.</v>

6295
03:10:34.060 --> 03:10:37.990
<v Speaker 5>All I do is just read all the time and read random random shit.</v>

6296
03:10:37.991 --> 03:10:38.500
<v Speaker 5>I try to,</v>

6297
03:10:38.500 --> 03:10:40.030
<v Speaker 5>I try to focus more now.</v>

6298
03:10:40.420 --> 03:10:43.750
<v Speaker 5>I'm basically because of the things I've learned from Peterson,</v>

6299
03:10:43.751 --> 03:10:44.690
<v Speaker 5>but um,</v>

6300
03:10:44.700 --> 03:10:44.980
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

6301
03:10:44.980 --> 03:10:46.670
<v Speaker 5>I just try to read as much as I can.</v>

6302
03:10:47.380 --> 03:10:48.213
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

6303
03:10:49.080 --> 03:10:49.610
<v Speaker 2>no</v>

6304
03:10:49.610 --> 03:10:51.320
<v Speaker 5>try to metabolize it I suppose.</v>

6305
03:10:51.321 --> 03:10:52.940
<v Speaker 5>But that's the key.</v>

6306
03:10:52.941 --> 03:10:53.810
<v Speaker 5>I think just reading,</v>

6307
03:10:53.870 --> 03:10:55.250
<v Speaker 5>reading classic literature,</v>

6308
03:10:55.251 --> 03:10:55.610
<v Speaker 5>reading,</v>

6309
03:10:55.610 --> 03:10:55.851
<v Speaker 5>reading,</v>

6310
03:10:55.851 --> 03:10:57.440
<v Speaker 5>things that are popular like in,</v>

6311
03:10:57.500 --> 03:10:58.311
<v Speaker 5>in the past.</v>

6312
03:10:58.311 --> 03:10:59.570
<v Speaker 5>I like op stuff.</v>

6313
03:10:59.571 --> 03:11:00.351
<v Speaker 5>I don't really care for her,</v>

6314
03:11:00.351 --> 03:11:05.000
<v Speaker 5>but like stuff that's rated as good by like really smart people.</v>

6315
03:11:05.060 --> 03:11:06.230
<v Speaker 5>That's a good way to start.</v>

6316
03:11:06.870 --> 03:11:07.703
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6317
03:11:08.780 --> 03:11:11.150
<v Speaker 5>So that's why I recommend even even fiction.</v>

6318
03:11:11.310 --> 03:11:12.143
<v Speaker 5>This all good</v>

6319
03:11:14.430 --> 03:11:15.350
<v Speaker 5>because it gets fixed.</v>

6320
03:11:15.390 --> 03:11:15.990
<v Speaker 5>It's fixed.</v>

6321
03:11:15.990 --> 03:11:17.060
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of like a time capsule.</v>

6322
03:11:17.061 --> 03:11:17.271
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

6323
03:11:17.271 --> 03:11:18.710
<v Speaker 5>So you learn a little bit about history too.</v>

6324
03:11:21.120 --> 03:11:21.953
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6325
03:11:24.980 --> 03:11:25.813
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6326
03:11:26.250 --> 03:11:27.270
<v Speaker 5>If you got anything,</v>

6327
03:11:27.810 --> 03:11:28.230
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

6328
03:11:28.230 --> 03:11:28.550
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

6329
03:11:28.550 --> 03:11:30.100
<v Speaker 5>If you've got anything you want me to talk to,</v>

6330
03:11:30.140 --> 03:11:31.940
<v Speaker 5>to maybe bring up next time,</v>

6331
03:11:31.970 --> 03:11:33.770
<v Speaker 5>I'm just to let me know.</v>

6332
03:11:33.840 --> 03:11:34.130
<v Speaker 5>I'll,</v>

6333
03:11:34.130 --> 03:11:34.870
<v Speaker 5>I'll look up,</v>

6334
03:11:34.870 --> 03:11:35.150
<v Speaker 5>I'll,</v>

6335
03:11:35.150 --> 03:11:40.150
<v Speaker 5>I'll try to see what I can learn about it if I get a chance and then we'll have</v>

6336
03:11:40.930 --> 03:11:41.763
<v Speaker 5>to talk about next time</v>

6337
03:11:43.350 --> 03:11:43.631
<v Speaker 5>if I,</v>

6338
03:11:43.631 --> 03:11:44.060
<v Speaker 5>if I,</v>

6339
03:11:44.060 --> 03:11:44.871
<v Speaker 5>if I got anything else,</v>

6340
03:11:44.871 --> 03:11:45.920
<v Speaker 5>I'll just pass it on to you.</v>

6341
03:11:46.640 --> 03:11:47.473
<v Speaker 5>Please do.</v>

6342
03:11:48.610 --> 03:11:49.020
<v Speaker 5>Alright.</v>

6345
03:11:51.970 --> 03:11:52.220
