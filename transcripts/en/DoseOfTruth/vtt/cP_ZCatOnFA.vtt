1
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.900
<v Speaker 1>So this is a big deal that this,</v>

2
00:00:08.901 --> 00:00:09.800
<v Speaker 1>that this happens.</v>

3
00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.900
<v Speaker 1>Now I want to tell you a little bit about the idea of the pillar because it's,</v>

4
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.950
<v Speaker 1>it's an unbelievably deep idea and it orients us in ways that we still don't,</v>

5
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.400
<v Speaker 1>it's still orients us in ways that we don't understand.</v>

6
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:26.750
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>

7
00:00:26.751 --> 00:00:30.680
<v Speaker 1>it's actually the mechanism by which we're oriented or,</v>

8
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.090
<v Speaker 1>and if it's lacking,</v>

9
00:00:32.091 --> 00:00:33.770
<v Speaker 1>then we become disoriented.</v>

10
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.770
<v Speaker 1>And so I'll show you some pictures and describe them first.</v>

11
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.251
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

12
00:00:37.251 --> 00:00:38.084
<v Speaker 1>So first of all,</v>

13
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.100
<v Speaker 1>there's a walled city.</v>

14
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:41.001
<v Speaker 1>So let,</v>

15
00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:44.600
<v Speaker 1>let me tell you that you could think about that as an archetypical human</v>

16
00:00:44.601 --> 00:00:45.434
<v Speaker 1>habitation.</v>

17
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.620
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's a reflection of something like a fire in the middle of the plane or</v>

18
00:00:50.811 --> 00:00:53.510
<v Speaker 1>the forest or the jungle for that matter.</v>

19
00:00:53.511 --> 00:00:55.250
<v Speaker 1>Although it's kind of hard to get a fire going there,</v>

20
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.410
<v Speaker 1>nudge in a fire,</v>

21
00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.220
<v Speaker 1>ringed round with logs and perhaps ringed around with dwellings,</v>

22
00:01:01.221 --> 00:01:01.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

23
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.850
<v Speaker 1>So the fires in the center and the fire defines the center.</v>

24
00:01:04.851 --> 00:01:06.920
<v Speaker 1>And then as you move away from the fire,</v>

25
00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:08.330
<v Speaker 1>you move out into the darkness,</v>

26
00:01:08.331 --> 00:01:08.571
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

27
00:01:08.571 --> 00:01:12.980
<v Speaker 1>So the fire is light and communion and safety.</v>

28
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.570
<v Speaker 1>And as you move away from the fire,</v>

29
00:01:14.571 --> 00:01:18.860
<v Speaker 1>you move out into the darkness and what's terrifying out beyond the perimeter.</v>

30
00:01:18.861 --> 00:01:20.720
<v Speaker 1>So what's beyond the perimeter is terrifying.</v>

31
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.660
<v Speaker 1>You can feel that if you go camping somewhere that's wild,</v>

32
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.100
<v Speaker 1>you know you're pretty damn happy.</v>

33
00:01:25.101 --> 00:01:26.480
<v Speaker 1>Especially if the wolves are howling,</v>

34
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.550
<v Speaker 1>you're pretty damn happy to be sitting by the fire because you can see there the</v>

35
00:01:31.551 --> 00:01:33.080
<v Speaker 1>fire keeps the animals away.</v>

36
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.680
<v Speaker 1>And you know if you do wander into the bush,</v>

37
00:01:36.681 --> 00:01:37.610
<v Speaker 1>into the darkness,</v>

38
00:01:37.611 --> 00:01:42.530
<v Speaker 1>then you're on alert and you know your Predator detection systems are on alert.</v>

39
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.800
<v Speaker 1>And so you could think about the classical human habitation as two places,</v>

40
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.880
<v Speaker 1>one where your Predator detection system isn't on alert and another where your</v>

41
00:01:52.881 --> 00:01:55.790
<v Speaker 1>Predator tech detection system is alert on alert.</v>

42
00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.870
<v Speaker 1>And you could think about that roughly as the distinction between explored</v>

43
00:01:59.871 --> 00:02:02.390
<v Speaker 1>territory and unexplored territory.</v>

44
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.710
<v Speaker 1>And really the,</v>

45
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.800
<v Speaker 1>the founding of a place is precisely,</v>

46
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.460
<v Speaker 1>this is a lot of this I got from reading your Eliana,</v>

47
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:15.010
<v Speaker 1>the founding of a place is precisely the definition of a UN explored center set</v>

48
00:02:16.281 --> 00:02:18.500
<v Speaker 1>against the unexplored periphery.</v>

49
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.750
<v Speaker 1>And you know what's interesting about that?</v>

50
00:02:20.751 --> 00:02:23.570
<v Speaker 1>So you can kind of think about that with regards to the walled city,</v>

51
00:02:23.571 --> 00:02:23.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

52
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.990
<v Speaker 1>Everything in the wall is cosmos and everything outside the wall is chaos and</v>

53
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:32.001
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

54
00:02:32.001 --> 00:02:36.710
<v Speaker 1>but it also extends to the conceptual realm because imagine that you're the</v>

55
00:02:36.711 --> 00:02:38.810
<v Speaker 1>master of a field of study.</v>

56
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.130
<v Speaker 1>And so that's an interesting metaphor because the field is that a geographical</v>

57
00:02:43.131 --> 00:02:43.701
<v Speaker 1>metaphor,</v>

58
00:02:43.701 --> 00:02:44.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

59
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.010
<v Speaker 1>And if in the center of the field are those things that everyone knows really</v>

60
00:02:49.011 --> 00:02:49.670
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

61
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.630
<v Speaker 1>the axioms that everyone abides by in the field.</v>

62
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.760
<v Speaker 1>And then as you move towards the fringes,</v>

63
00:02:55.761 --> 00:02:57.890
<v Speaker 1>you get towards towards the unknown,</v>

64
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.490
<v Speaker 1>towards the frontier of the discipline.</v>

65
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.710
<v Speaker 1>And as you become expert,</v>

66
00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:04.720
<v Speaker 1>you move from the center to the frontier.</v>

67
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.100
<v Speaker 1>And so then you're on the border.</v>

68
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.660
<v Speaker 1>When you're,</v>

69
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:08.230
<v Speaker 1>when you're,</v>

70
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.310
<v Speaker 1>when you're a scholar,</v>

71
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:10.450
<v Speaker 1>a competence call,</v>

72
00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:15.370
<v Speaker 1>you're on the border between the unexplored or the explored an unexplored,</v>

73
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.230
<v Speaker 1>and you're trying to further that border.</v>

74
00:03:17.231 --> 00:03:19.390
<v Speaker 1>So even if you're just doing this abstractly,</v>

75
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:20.860
<v Speaker 1>it's the same thing.</v>

76
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.930
<v Speaker 1>And it's a reflection of the fact that every human environment,</v>

77
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.010
<v Speaker 1>concrete or abstract,</v>

78
00:03:28.011 --> 00:03:29.080
<v Speaker 1>it makes no difference.</v>

79
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.710
<v Speaker 1>Recapitulates the cosmos chaos dichotomy or the order chaos dichotomy.</v>

80
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.130
<v Speaker 1>And that's why endow isn't,</v>

81
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.003
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

82
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.360
<v Speaker 1>it's the union of chaos and order that constitutes being itself and that you</v>

83
00:03:43.361 --> 00:03:47.740
<v Speaker 1>stand on the border between chaos and order because that's the proper place to</v>

84
00:03:47.741 --> 00:03:49.240
<v Speaker 1>be too orderly,</v>

85
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.280
<v Speaker 1>too much in the explored.</v>

86
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.450
<v Speaker 1>You're not learning anything too much out there where the predators lurk,</v>

87
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.280
<v Speaker 1>then you're frozen with terror.</v>

88
00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.760
<v Speaker 1>And neither of those positions are desirable.</v>

89
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.253
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

90
00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.520
<v Speaker 1>and that's what you know.</v>

91
00:04:03.521 --> 00:04:04.600
<v Speaker 1>And so you think,</v>

92
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.680
<v Speaker 1>and this is a concrete reality obviously as well as a psychological reality,</v>

93
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.900
<v Speaker 1>there were reasons for those walls,</v>

94
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.981
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

95
00:04:11.981 --> 00:04:15.700
<v Speaker 1>Because inside the walls were all the people like us.</v>

96
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.530
<v Speaker 1>And so that begs the question,</v>

97
00:04:17.531 --> 00:04:19.900
<v Speaker 1>what does it mean for people to be like us?</v>

98
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.030
<v Speaker 1>And then outside the wall of the rows,</v>

99
00:04:22.031 --> 00:04:23.320
<v Speaker 1>all those people,</v>

100
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.790
<v Speaker 1>because they were the worst forms of predators because people are actually the</v>

101
00:04:27.791 --> 00:04:31.240
<v Speaker 1>worst forms of predators who aren't like us.</v>

102
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.610
<v Speaker 1>And the wall is there to draw a distinction between like us and not like us.</v>

103
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.781
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

104
00:04:37.781 --> 00:04:39.490
<v Speaker 1>and that was a matter of life and death.</v>

105
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.620
<v Speaker 1>You can tell that because I mean,</v>

106
00:04:41.621 --> 00:04:42.820
<v Speaker 1>look at those walls.</v>

107
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.530
<v Speaker 1>They had to build those by hand.</v>

108
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.281
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

109
00:04:45.281 --> 00:04:49.060
<v Speaker 1>you do see walled cities that have three rings of walls.</v>

110
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.550
<v Speaker 1>So these people were terrified,</v>

111
00:04:51.551 --> 00:04:55.030
<v Speaker 1>but not so terrified as the people who built three walls.</v>

112
00:04:55.031 --> 00:04:58.180
<v Speaker 1>They were really terrified and they had their reasons.</v>
