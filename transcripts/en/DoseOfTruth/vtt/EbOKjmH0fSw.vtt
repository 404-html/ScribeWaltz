00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.440
<v Speaker 1>Good question.</v>

2
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.670
<v Speaker 1>Ask yourself what would motivate you?</v>

3
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.960
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:10.793
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

5
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.330
<v Speaker 1>don't be studying eight hours a day cause that isn't going to work and you're</v>

6
00:00:14.331 --> 00:00:15.540
<v Speaker 1>not going to do it anyways.</v>

7
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.590
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

8
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.810
<v Speaker 1>when you start studying five minutes a day,</v>

9
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:19.650
<v Speaker 1>seriously,</v>

10
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.100
<v Speaker 1>would you,</v>

11
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.870
<v Speaker 1>could you bring it up to 10 minutes a day?</v>

12
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.430
<v Speaker 1>What would you have to do for yourself to get yourself to sit down for half an</v>

13
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.480
<v Speaker 1>hour a day and,</v>

14
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.190
<v Speaker 1>and study intently?</v>

15
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:30.510
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe you'd have to,</v>

16
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you'd have to do,</v>

17
00:00:31.921 --> 00:00:34.500
<v Speaker 1>like have a beer at six o'clock at night or something.</v>

18
00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:37.260
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe you'd have to go for a walk in the park or go out for coffee.</v>

19
00:00:37.261 --> 00:00:37.890
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

20
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.890
<v Speaker 1>imagine that you're sitting down with a stupid undisciplined child who,</v>

21
00:00:42.901 --> 00:00:45.630
<v Speaker 1>and you're trying to get that child to do something useful and you say,</v>

22
00:00:45.631 --> 00:00:45.871
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

23
00:00:45.871 --> 00:00:46.704
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

24
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.120
<v Speaker 1>I want you to do x.</v>

25
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.110
<v Speaker 1>It's necessary,</v>

26
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.620
<v Speaker 1>but you can pick how much of it you're going to do and I'll give you what you</v>

27
00:00:52.621 --> 00:00:54.440
<v Speaker 1>want if you do it well,</v>

28
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.310
<v Speaker 1>ask yourself that and see what happens.</v>

29
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.890
<v Speaker 1>So don't try to tyrannized yourself,</v>

30
00:00:58.891 --> 00:00:59.161
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

31
00:00:59.161 --> 00:01:03.270
<v Speaker 1>try to negotiate with yourself and use some reward and see how that works and</v>

32
00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:03.991
<v Speaker 1>start slow.</v>

33
00:01:03.991 --> 00:01:04.261
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

34
00:01:04.261 --> 00:01:04.890
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

35
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.010
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're not very disciplined and the best you can do is half an hour of</v>

36
00:01:08.011 --> 00:01:09.120
<v Speaker 1>studying a day.</v>

37
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.430
<v Speaker 1>Well start with half an hour.</v>

38
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.500
<v Speaker 1>Increase that five minutes a week.</v>

39
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.190
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

40
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.821
<v Speaker 1>if you do that,</v>

41
00:01:14.821 --> 00:01:15.451
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot.</v>

42
00:01:15.451 --> 00:01:15.900
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

43
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.250
<v Speaker 1>if you do that for a year,</v>

44
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.010
<v Speaker 1>then you'll,</v>

45
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.930
<v Speaker 1>by the end of the year,</v>

46
00:01:18.931 --> 00:01:20.640
<v Speaker 1>you'll be studying four hours a day.</v>

47
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.020
<v Speaker 1>So you can eat.</v>

48
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.500
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

49
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.580
<v Speaker 1>that's just with five,</v>

50
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.140
<v Speaker 1>that's just with five minutes a week,</v>

51
00:01:25.141 --> 00:01:25.301
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

52
00:01:25.301 --> 00:01:27.360
<v Speaker 1>Because that's 250 minutes in a year.</v>

53
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.960
<v Speaker 1>So start ridiculously pathetically study for five minutes a day for a week and</v>

54
00:01:36.901 --> 00:01:41.901
<v Speaker 1>then move it to 10 you may have to do that and don't cheat.</v>

55
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.301
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

56
00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:45.210
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things people do is they make a deal with themselves like</v>

57
00:01:45.211 --> 00:01:45.420
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

58
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.841
<v Speaker 1>I'm all,</v>

59
00:01:45.841 --> 00:01:48.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to study for 10 minutes a day each day.</v>

60
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.460
<v Speaker 1>And then they,</v>

61
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.570
<v Speaker 1>they get into it,</v>

62
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.911
<v Speaker 1>they think,</v>

63
00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:51.121
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

64
00:01:51.121 --> 00:01:52.110
<v Speaker 1>this is going really good.</v>

65
00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:55.650
<v Speaker 1>So they study for two hours and then they broken the contract with themselves</v>

66
00:01:55.651 --> 00:01:57.090
<v Speaker 1>and they don't trust themselves anymore.</v>

67
00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.910
<v Speaker 1>And then they don't study for a whole year or,</v>

68
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.390
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

69
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.800
<v Speaker 1>maybe not for a month.</v>

70
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.730
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

71
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.290
<v Speaker 1>but set your contract,</v>

72
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:05.700
<v Speaker 1>ask yourself,</v>

73
00:02:05.701 --> 00:02:06.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

74
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.150
<v Speaker 1>what could I do to move myself forward to my goal that I would do?</v>

75
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.060
<v Speaker 1>And then how can I improve that incrementally?</v>

76
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.250
<v Speaker 1>So that's the right way of going about that.</v>

77
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.503
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

78
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.020
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
