00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.980
<v Speaker 1>When you stop and think about where you came from,</v>

2
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.240
<v Speaker 1>you most likely a reminded of your mother or a street you grew up on.</v>

3
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.790
<v Speaker 1>But think about evolution and biology class and the animal that we are closest</v>

4
00:00:23.791 --> 00:00:25.140
<v Speaker 1>to the chimp.</v>

5
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.330
<v Speaker 1>There were based systems that control us and these systems have been studied in</v>

6
00:00:30.331 --> 00:00:32.610
<v Speaker 1>animals that date back much farther than the monkey.</v>

7
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.140
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

8
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.490
<v Speaker 1>the animal which gives us insight into why base drives like status and hierarchy</v>

9
00:00:38.491 --> 00:00:42.150
<v Speaker 1>are built in date back one third of a billion years.</v>

10
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.060
<v Speaker 1>And if you've been following Dr. Jordan Peterson,</v>

11
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.120
<v Speaker 1>you'll know exactly what animal I'm talking about.</v>

12
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.380
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

13
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.213
<v Speaker 1>you guessed it.</v>

14
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.473
<v Speaker 1>The lobster,</v>

15
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.010
<v Speaker 1>the display of status is something that dates back thousands of years.</v>

16
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.470
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at the lobsters habitat.</v>

17
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.930
<v Speaker 1>It's a volatile place with many lobsters struggling to hunt for food and</v>

18
00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:06.810
<v Speaker 1>occasionally settling for scraps that fall from the sky above.</v>

19
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.240
<v Speaker 1>If food wasn't enough to have to worry about shelter is the next item to</v>

20
00:01:12.241 --> 00:01:13.074
<v Speaker 1>struggle over.</v>

21
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.540
<v Speaker 1>And because shelter is so scarce,</v>

22
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.450
<v Speaker 1>lobsters have to resort to the only method which,</v>

23
00:01:18.451 --> 00:01:20.100
<v Speaker 1>which they know how to acquire things.</v>

24
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:21.563
<v Speaker 1>Dominance.</v>

25
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.610
<v Speaker 1>Now it's a fun scene that is painted in the 12 rules for life of the physical</v>

26
00:01:26.611 --> 00:01:28.560
<v Speaker 1>struggle for dominance among lobsters.</v>

27
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.030
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

28
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.020
<v Speaker 1>for the sake of time,</v>

29
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.520
<v Speaker 1>I'll cut to the end of a fight.</v>

30
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.800
<v Speaker 1>Having defined a clear winner and loser.</v>

31
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.300
<v Speaker 1>Now it doesn't take a physical altercation to mark a winner or a loser that is</v>

32
00:01:41.641 --> 00:01:43.440
<v Speaker 1>largely governed by neuro chemistry.</v>

33
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.140
<v Speaker 1>The two chemicals that governed the lobsters,</v>

34
00:01:46.141 --> 00:01:51.141
<v Speaker 1>mood and behavior are serotonin and October Jamine Serotonin and I've Topa mean</v>

35
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:53.820
<v Speaker 1>exist in balance.</v>

36
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.310
<v Speaker 1>And when Serotonin is at a higher level and October me lower the effect is very</v>

37
00:01:59.311 --> 00:01:59.791
<v Speaker 1>confident.</v>

38
00:01:59.791 --> 00:02:03.540
<v Speaker 1>Lobster of Mcgregor ready to fight everyone type of lobster.</v>

39
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.250
<v Speaker 1>Also heightened serotonin makes a lobster ready to fight and display its</v>

40
00:02:08.251 --> 00:02:11.760
<v Speaker 1>dominance continuously and as long as the lobster wins,</v>

41
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.530
<v Speaker 1>the serotonin levels stay high.</v>

42
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.480
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

43
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.770
<v Speaker 1>if the lobster loses,</v>

44
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.630
<v Speaker 1>the inverse happens and an increased level of October mean and lowered serotonin</v>

45
00:02:21.631 --> 00:02:26.631
<v Speaker 1>occur leaving a very sad er sort of lobster soaking around too afraid to fight.</v>

46
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.350
<v Speaker 1>If a previous dominant lobster loses a fight is once dominant brain transforms</v>

47
00:02:33.371 --> 00:02:38.371
<v Speaker 1>into a new subordinate brain knocking him down the hierarchy like with humans.</v>

48
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.800
<v Speaker 1>The spoils go to the dominant,</v>

49
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.600
<v Speaker 1>the prime real estate,</v>

50
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.970
<v Speaker 1>all the ladies and all the scrap food.</v>

51
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.490
<v Speaker 1>The dominance hierarchy is the other biological structure built into us and all</v>

52
00:02:50.491 --> 00:02:51.324
<v Speaker 1>other animals.</v>

53
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:52.523
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

54
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:53.733
<v Speaker 1>builtin.</v>

55
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.330
<v Speaker 1>It isn't the result of social constructs like capitalism,</v>

56
00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.500
<v Speaker 1>communism.</v>

57
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.300
<v Speaker 1>It's not the military industrial complex.</v>

58
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:02.950
<v Speaker 1>It's not the patriarchy.</v>

59
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.690
<v Speaker 1>It's not a human creation.</v>

60
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.280
<v Speaker 1>The dominance hierarchy has been deeply rooted for hundreds of millions of</v>

61
00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:10.114
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

62
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.620
<v Speaker 1>We saw it in grained in the lobster brain and it is a permanent fact of life.</v>

63
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.270
<v Speaker 1>The human brain at a basic level shares a similar neuro chemistry with the</v>

64
00:03:19.271 --> 00:03:20.104
<v Speaker 1>lobster.</v>

65
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.740
<v Speaker 1>When a human loses a battle or suffers a defeat or betrayal,</v>

66
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.650
<v Speaker 1>we often recoil and pull within ourselves.</v>

67
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.930
<v Speaker 1>If we stay down for long enough,</v>

68
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.490
<v Speaker 1>we become chronically depressed.</v>

69
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.560
<v Speaker 1>Serotonin that governs posture and fight or flight reactions in lobsters has a</v>

70
00:03:35.561 --> 00:03:37.000
<v Speaker 1>similar effect in humans.</v>

71
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.340
<v Speaker 1>Low ranking lobsters are like low ranking human beings and that their behavior</v>

72
00:03:42.341 --> 00:03:42.941
<v Speaker 1>is similar.</v>

73
00:03:42.941 --> 00:03:44.590
<v Speaker 1>When levels of Serotonin are low,</v>

74
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.000
<v Speaker 1>low confidence,</v>

75
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.741
<v Speaker 1>costly.</v>

76
00:03:46.741 --> 00:03:50.830
<v Speaker 1>Your stress response and being at the bottom of the hierarchy generally means</v>

77
00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:52.990
<v Speaker 1>more bad things can and will happen,</v>

78
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:54.550
<v Speaker 1>less happiness,</v>

79
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.290
<v Speaker 1>more pain and anxiety,</v>

80
00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.820
<v Speaker 1>more illness and a shorter lifespan and with higher levels of Serotonin.</v>

81
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.170
<v Speaker 1>The end verse effects occur.</v>

82
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:03.730
<v Speaker 1>Less illness,</v>

83
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.080
<v Speaker 1>less misery in depth,</v>

84
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:06.250
<v Speaker 1>a better income.</v>

85
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:08.410
<v Speaker 1>At an unconscious level,</v>

86
00:04:08.411 --> 00:04:10.750
<v Speaker 1>your status is tracked at the root of your brain.</v>

87
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.540
<v Speaker 1>If you're male and your status is high,</v>

88
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.870
<v Speaker 1>you have preferential access to the best places to live.</v>

89
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.280
<v Speaker 1>The highest quality food people want to socialize and will do anything to help</v>

90
00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:22.114
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

91
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.420
<v Speaker 1>You have limitless opportunity for romantic and sexual contact.</v>

92
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.670
<v Speaker 1>If you're a female at the top,</v>

93
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.440
<v Speaker 1>you have access to many attractive,</v>

94
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:30.303
<v Speaker 1>creative,</v>

95
00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.030
<v Speaker 1>reliable,</v>

96
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.541
<v Speaker 1>honest,</v>

97
00:04:31.541 --> 00:04:34.720
<v Speaker 1>high quality men and like the dominant male,</v>

98
00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:36.100
<v Speaker 1>you compete ferociously,</v>

99
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.610
<v Speaker 1>even piddle Asley to maintain or improve your position.</v>

100
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.950
<v Speaker 1>The opposite end of the diamond at the opposite end of the dominance hierarchy</v>

101
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.210
<v Speaker 1>is a dangerous place.</v>

102
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.190
<v Speaker 1>No good places to live,</v>

103
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.160
<v Speaker 1>if any terrible food when not starving,</v>

104
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.780
<v Speaker 1>poor physical and mental condition as you're a minimum romantic interest to</v>

105
00:04:55.781 --> 00:04:58.330
<v Speaker 1>anyone unless they are as desperate as you are.</v>

106
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.780
<v Speaker 1>The part of your brain that assesses dominance,</v>

107
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.850
<v Speaker 1>watches how you were treated by other people.</v>

108
00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.240
<v Speaker 1>The part of your brain that assesses dominance,</v>

109
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.400
<v Speaker 1>watches how you are treated by other people,</v>

110
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.510
<v Speaker 1>how you are treated renders your value and assigns status.</v>

111
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.300
<v Speaker 1>If you were judged to have little worth,</v>

112
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.220
<v Speaker 1>your brain restricts serotonin.</v>

113
00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:22.750
<v Speaker 1>This makes you more physically and psychologically reactive to any event that</v>

114
00:05:22.751 --> 00:05:23.740
<v Speaker 1>produces emotion,</v>

115
00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:25.660
<v Speaker 1>particularly negative ones.</v>

116
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.390
<v Speaker 1>That reactivity is needed,</v>

117
00:05:28.391 --> 00:05:29.680
<v Speaker 1>where emergency is common,</v>

118
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.540
<v Speaker 1>constantly being alert,</v>

119
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.150
<v Speaker 1>burns up precious energy and physical resources.</v>

120
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:35.680
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

121
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.430
<v Speaker 1>all emergencies will be tackled loan because of the lack of quality social</v>

122
00:05:39.431 --> 00:05:41.590
<v Speaker 1>network at the bottom.</v>

123
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.950
<v Speaker 1>You continually sacrifice what you could otherwise store for the future.</v>

124
00:05:44.951 --> 00:05:49.930
<v Speaker 1>Using it up on a heightened readiness drug use and promiscuity and myriad.</v>

125
00:05:49.931 --> 00:05:54.931
<v Speaker 1>Other things are used to cope with the stress that habits can present serious</v>

126
00:05:55.001 --> 00:05:56.830
<v Speaker 1>problems and what does the physical,</v>

127
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.711
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

128
00:05:57.711 --> 00:06:00.350
<v Speaker 1>it can be labeled and mistaken as a mental illness.</v>

129
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.700
<v Speaker 1>The positive feedback loop that alcoholism can create can be fatal.</v>

130
00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.850
<v Speaker 1>Imagine someone who enjoys drinking alcohol.</v>

131
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.460
<v Speaker 1>He has a few drinks and his blood alcohol level rises and when he stops it</v>

132
00:06:13.461 --> 00:06:18.440
<v Speaker 1>plateaus and begins to fall and when his body starts to metabolize the ethanol,</v>

133
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:19.430
<v Speaker 1>he has a hangover.</v>

134
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:21.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

135
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.490
<v Speaker 1>most alcoholics at some point realized drinking helps fight the hangover.</v>

136
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:26.360
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

137
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.530
<v Speaker 1>postponing the withdrawal long enough can be fatal when the cause of the problem</v>

138
00:06:30.531 --> 00:06:31.490
<v Speaker 1>is also the cure.</v>

139
00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.500
<v Speaker 1>Creating a positive feedback loop.</v>

140
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.570
<v Speaker 1>The problem can spiral out of control.</v>

141
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:37.520
<v Speaker 1>With depression,</v>

142
00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:42.660
<v Speaker 1>a person feels useless and burdensome so that'd become isolated and that intern</v>

143
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.060
<v Speaker 1>amplifies the depression.</v>

144
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.620
<v Speaker 1>Social anxiety often cause from some sort of</v>

145
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.020
<v Speaker 1>social anxiety often caused from some type of trauma like bullying can lead a</v>

146
00:06:54.021 --> 00:06:55.760
<v Speaker 1>person to avoid eye contact,</v>

147
00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:56.421
<v Speaker 1>be upset,</v>

148
00:06:56.421 --> 00:07:01.421
<v Speaker 1>easily be certain or indecisive and take a habitually submissive posture that's</v>

149
00:07:01.761 --> 00:07:05.720
<v Speaker 1>observed by all and sometimes further exploited by adults that have remained</v>

150
00:07:05.721 --> 00:07:06.830
<v Speaker 1>Billie's into adulthood.</v>

151
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.300
<v Speaker 1>Some people become bullied because they can't fight back.</v>

152
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.033
<v Speaker 1>For kids,</v>

153
00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:15.740
<v Speaker 1>a six year old is no match for a nine year old.</v>

154
00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.940
<v Speaker 1>Women tend to be less physically strong in the upper body than men.</v>

155
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.770
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

156
00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:23.810
<v Speaker 1>some people choose not to fight back.</v>

157
00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:29.060
<v Speaker 1>The temperament of a person that's bullied is commonly compassionate and self</v>

158
00:07:29.061 --> 00:07:34.061
<v Speaker 1>sacrificing and high in negative emotion and it doesn't help when they make all</v>

159
00:07:34.641 --> 00:07:39.260
<v Speaker 1>sorts of noises that please the sadistic no step dad,</v>

160
00:07:39.261 --> 00:07:42.590
<v Speaker 1>her crying works especially well.</v>

161
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:48.440
<v Speaker 1>People who have had tyrannical parents can become sensitive to tyranny and</v>

162
00:07:48.441 --> 00:07:51.090
<v Speaker 1>overaggressive competitiveness and restricted.</v>

163
00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:54.350
<v Speaker 1>They themselves all the emotions that might give rise to such things.</v>

164
00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.280
<v Speaker 1>These people may decide that all forms of aggression,</v>

165
00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:00.890
<v Speaker 1>including feelings of anger are morally wrong.</v>

166
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:05.030
<v Speaker 1>These people restrict their ability to fight back and because of their</v>

167
00:08:05.031 --> 00:08:07.820
<v Speaker 1>compassionate and self sacrificing temperament,</v>

168
00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:11.060
<v Speaker 1>which often turns out to be naive and exploitable,</v>

169
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:14.390
<v Speaker 1>are unable to call forth the genuinely righteous,</v>

170
00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:15.170
<v Speaker 1>inappropriate,</v>

171
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:18.530
<v Speaker 1>self-protective anger necessary to defend themselves.</v>

172
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.000
<v Speaker 1>If you can bite,</v>

173
00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:21.710
<v Speaker 1>you generally don't have too.</v>

174
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:23.870
<v Speaker 1>When integrated properly,</v>

175
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:27.980
<v Speaker 1>the ability to respond with aggression and violence decreases rather than</v>

176
00:08:27.981 --> 00:08:31.640
<v Speaker 1>increases the probability that actual aggression will become necessary.</v>

177
00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:36.080
<v Speaker 1>If you say no early in the cycle of oppression and mean it,</v>

178
00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:38.330
<v Speaker 1>then you will limit its effect on you.</v>

179
00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.350
<v Speaker 1>When naive people discover the capacity for anger within,</v>

180
00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:44.810
<v Speaker 1>they are sometimes shocked severely.</v>

181
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:45.891
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

182
00:08:45.891 --> 00:08:49.910
<v Speaker 1>when people recognize themselves as dangerous there fear decreases.</v>

183
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:51.890
<v Speaker 1>They develop more self respect.</v>

184
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:56.190
<v Speaker 1>There is a little difference between the capacity for mayhem and destruction</v>

185
00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:01.220
<v Speaker 1>integrated and the strength of character applying rule one standing up straight</v>

186
00:09:01.561 --> 00:09:05.520
<v Speaker 1>with your soldiers back is made much simpler by instilling a few routines in</v>

187
00:09:05.521 --> 00:09:06.354
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>

188
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:10.410
<v Speaker 1>Routines are necessary in many aspects of life to keeping your brain functioning</v>

189
00:09:10.411 --> 00:09:11.244
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>

190
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:16.590
<v Speaker 1>Sleep is the first area that you want to address specifically when you wake up.</v>

191
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:18.263
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

192
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.330
<v Speaker 1>you want to wake up around the same time other people wake up around you.</v>

193
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.860
<v Speaker 1>The relevance of proper sleep patterns is easily observable.</v>

194
00:09:25.861 --> 00:09:29.280
<v Speaker 1>When you see the difference between well rested and sleep deprived children</v>

195
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:30.780
<v Speaker 1>night and day.</v>

196
00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.980
<v Speaker 1>Not only does sleep regulate your security and rhythms,</v>

197
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:36.480
<v Speaker 1>but eating does too,</v>

198
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:39.450
<v Speaker 1>so alongside waking up at the same time,</v>

199
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:42.180
<v Speaker 1>eating at the same time can be important as well.</v>

200
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.820
<v Speaker 1>What to eat is equally important.</v>

201
00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:49.200
<v Speaker 1>High fat and high protein is preferred to simple carbs and sugars.</v>

202
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:52.500
<v Speaker 1>Unlike fat and protein rich meals,</v>

203
00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:57.480
<v Speaker 1>simple carbs and sugars exacerbate existing physiological and psychological</v>

204
00:09:57.481 --> 00:10:02.481
<v Speaker 1>problems and cause spikes and dips in blood sugar that people identify as rushes</v>

205
00:10:02.581 --> 00:10:03.414
<v Speaker 1>and crashes.</v>

206
00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:08.910
<v Speaker 1>High fat and high protein diets leave you feeling energized and more balanced</v>

207
00:10:08.911 --> 00:10:09.744
<v Speaker 1>throughout the day.</v>

208
00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.110
<v Speaker 1>If you feel like you're a loser,</v>

209
00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:14.183
<v Speaker 1>maybe you are.</v>

210
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:15.383
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you aren't.</v>

211
00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:16.741
<v Speaker 1>Regardless,</v>

212
00:10:16.741 --> 00:10:17.730
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to be.</v>

213
00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:22.020
<v Speaker 1>You may just have one bad habit or a collection of bad habits.</v>

214
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.570
<v Speaker 1>You may have developed bad posture.</v>

215
00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:29.280
<v Speaker 1>You may have been bullied or unpopular at home or in school.</v>

216
00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.410
<v Speaker 1>It's not necessarily appropriate.</v>

217
00:10:31.411 --> 00:10:32.244
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

218
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:33.750
<v Speaker 1>circumstances change.</v>

219
00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:36.330
<v Speaker 1>If you slump around like the defeated lobster,</v>

220
00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:37.920
<v Speaker 1>people will treat you as such.</v>

221
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:42.510
<v Speaker 1>Then your brain won't produce as much serotonin which will make you less happy</v>

222
00:10:42.511 --> 00:10:44.040
<v Speaker 1>and more anxious and sad.</v>

223
00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.790
<v Speaker 1>Your probability of living in a nice place,</v>

224
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:48.930
<v Speaker 1>finding a stable,</v>

225
00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:49.793
<v Speaker 1>healthy mate,</v>

226
00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:53.160
<v Speaker 1>your access to high quality resources will decrease.</v>

227
00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:57.600
<v Speaker 1>You will live for the present and not defer gratification and you will be more</v>

228
00:10:57.601 --> 00:10:58.980
<v Speaker 1>likely to abuse drugs.</v>

229
00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.350
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm going to read a few pages of Jordan's book.</v>

230
00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:04.180
<v Speaker 1>You might object.</v>

231
00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:05.200
<v Speaker 1>The bottom is real.</v>

232
00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:08.230
<v Speaker 1>Being at the bottom is equally real.</v>

233
00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:09.401
<v Speaker 1>Emir.</v>

234
00:11:09.401 --> 00:11:13.120
<v Speaker 1>Transformation of posture is insufficient to change anything that is fixed.</v>

235
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:17.830
<v Speaker 1>If you're in the number 10 position and standing up straight and appearing</v>

236
00:11:17.831 --> 00:11:20.590
<v Speaker 1>dominant might only attract the attention of those who want.</v>

237
00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:24.040
<v Speaker 1>Once again to put you down and fair enough,</v>

238
00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:28.150
<v Speaker 1>but standing up straight with your shoulders back is not something that is only</v>

239
00:11:28.151 --> 00:11:30.880
<v Speaker 1>physical because you're not only a body,</v>

240
00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:32.193
<v Speaker 1>you're a spirit,</v>

241
00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:33.490
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

242
00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:34.840
<v Speaker 1>a psyche as well.</v>

243
00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:40.030
<v Speaker 1>Standing up physically also implies and invokes and demands.</v>

244
00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:40.750
<v Speaker 1>Standing up.</v>

245
00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:45.750
<v Speaker 1>Metaphysically standing up means voluntarily accepting the burden of being your</v>

246
00:11:47.561 --> 00:11:50.320
<v Speaker 1>nervous system responds in an entirely different manner.</v>

247
00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:52.840
<v Speaker 1>When you face the demands of life voluntarily,</v>

248
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:54.850
<v Speaker 1>you respond to a challenge.</v>

249
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.830
<v Speaker 1>Instead of bracing for a catastrophe,</v>

250
00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:58.263
<v Speaker 1>you see the goal,</v>

251
00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:01.660
<v Speaker 1>the dragon hoards instead of shrinking and terror from the all too,</v>

252
00:12:01.661 --> 00:12:03.070
<v Speaker 1>real fact of the Dragon.</v>

253
00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.750
<v Speaker 1>You stepped forward to take your place in the dominance hierarchy and occupy</v>

254
00:12:07.751 --> 00:12:08.650
<v Speaker 1>your territory,</v>

255
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.930
<v Speaker 1>manifesting your willingness to defend,</v>

256
00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:11.860
<v Speaker 1>expand,</v>

257
00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:12.910
<v Speaker 1>and transform it.</v>

258
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:18.940
<v Speaker 1>That can all occur practically or symbolically as a physical or as a conceptual</v>

259
00:12:18.941 --> 00:12:19.830
<v Speaker 1>reconstruction.</v>

260
00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:24.190
<v Speaker 1>To stand up straight with your shoulders back is to accept the terrible</v>

261
00:12:24.191 --> 00:12:26.830
<v Speaker 1>responsibility of life with eyes wide open.</v>

262
00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:31.450
<v Speaker 1>It means deciding to voluntarily transformed the chaos of potential into the</v>

263
00:12:31.451 --> 00:12:33.250
<v Speaker 1>realities of habitable order.</v>

264
00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:38.620
<v Speaker 1>It means adopting the burden of self conscious vulnerability and accepting the</v>

265
00:12:38.621 --> 00:12:43.420
<v Speaker 1>end of the unconscious paradise of childhood where finitude and mortality are</v>

266
00:12:43.421 --> 00:12:44.890
<v Speaker 1>only dimly comprehended.</v>

267
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:49.840
<v Speaker 1>It means willingly undertaking the sacrifices necessary to generate a productive</v>

268
00:12:49.841 --> 00:12:51.130
<v Speaker 1>and meaningful reality.</v>

269
00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:56.230
<v Speaker 1>It means acting to please God in the ancient language to stand up straight with</v>

270
00:12:56.231 --> 00:12:56.681
<v Speaker 1>your shoulders.</v>

271
00:12:56.681 --> 00:13:00.400
<v Speaker 1>Back means building the Ark that protects the world from the flood,</v>

272
00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.820
<v Speaker 1>guiding your people through the desert after they have escaped tyranny,</v>

273
00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:08.680
<v Speaker 1>making your way away from comfortable home and country and speaking the</v>

274
00:13:08.681 --> 00:13:11.770
<v Speaker 1>prophetic word to those who ignore the widows and children.</v>

275
00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:15.220
<v Speaker 1>It means shouldering the cross that marks the ex,</v>

276
00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:18.940
<v Speaker 1>the place where you and being intersect so terribly.</v>

277
00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:24.700
<v Speaker 1>It means casting dead rigid and too tyrannical order back into the chaos in</v>

278
00:13:24.701 --> 00:13:25.750
<v Speaker 1>which it was generated.</v>

279
00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:31.060
<v Speaker 1>It means withstanding the ensuing uncertainty and establishing in consequence a</v>

280
00:13:31.061 --> 00:13:31.570
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>

281
00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:33.850
<v Speaker 1>more meaningful and more productive order.</v>

282
00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:36.700
<v Speaker 1>So at 10 carefully to your posture,</v>

283
00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.100
<v Speaker 1>quit drooping and hunching around.</v>

284
00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.330
<v Speaker 1>Speak your mind,</v>

285
00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.570
<v Speaker 1>puts your desires forward as if you had a right to them,</v>

286
00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:48.910
<v Speaker 1>at least the same right as others walk tall and gays forthrightly ahead,</v>

287
00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:50.980
<v Speaker 1>dare to be dangerous.</v>

288
00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:54.730
<v Speaker 1>Encourage the Serotonin to float plentifully through the neuropathways.</v>

289
00:13:54.731 --> 00:13:58.000
<v Speaker 1>Desperate for its calming influence and people,</v>

290
00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:01.660
<v Speaker 1>including yourself will start to assume that you're a competent and able,</v>

291
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:06.280
<v Speaker 1>or at least they will not immediately conclude the reverse emboldened by the</v>

292
00:14:06.281 --> 00:14:07.170
<v Speaker 1>positive response.</v>

293
00:14:07.171 --> 00:14:08.470
<v Speaker 1>As you are now receiving,</v>

294
00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:10.240
<v Speaker 1>you will begin to be less anxious.</v>

295
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.960
<v Speaker 1>You will then find it easier to pay attention to the subtle social cues that</v>

296
00:14:13.961 --> 00:14:16.060
<v Speaker 1>people exchange when they are communicating.</v>

297
00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:20.530
<v Speaker 1>Your conversations will flow better with fewer awkward pauses.</v>

298
00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:23.080
<v Speaker 1>This will make you more likely to meet people,</v>

299
00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:24.160
<v Speaker 1>interact with them,</v>

300
00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.233
<v Speaker 1>and impress them.</v>

301
00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:26.651
<v Speaker 1>Doing so,</v>

302
00:14:26.651 --> 00:14:30.130
<v Speaker 1>we'll not only genuinely increase the probability that good things will happen</v>

303
00:14:30.131 --> 00:14:30.964
<v Speaker 1>to you.</v>

304
00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:34.060
<v Speaker 1>It will also make those good things feel better when they do happen.</v>

305
00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:36.760
<v Speaker 1>Thus strengthened and emboldened.</v>

306
00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:41.740
<v Speaker 1>You may choose to embrace being and worked for its furtherance and improvement,</v>

307
00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.270
<v Speaker 1>thus strengthened.</v>

308
00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.690
<v Speaker 1>You may be able to stand even during the illness of a loved one,</v>

309
00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:48.730
<v Speaker 1>even during the death of a parent,</v>

310
00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:53.240
<v Speaker 1>and allow others to find strength alongside you when they would otherwise be</v>

311
00:14:53.241 --> 00:14:56.690
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmed with the spare thus emboldened,</v>

312
00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.730
<v Speaker 1>you will embark on the voyage of your life.</v>

313
00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:00.200
<v Speaker 1>Let your light shine,</v>

314
00:15:00.201 --> 00:15:00.980
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

315
00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:03.890
<v Speaker 1>on the Heavenly Hill and pursue your rightful destiny.</v>

316
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:08.180
<v Speaker 1>Then the meeting of your life may be sufficient to keep the corrupting influence</v>

317
00:15:08.181 --> 00:15:09.500
<v Speaker 1>of mortal disparate bay.</v>

318
00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:15.410
<v Speaker 1>Then you may be able to accept the terrible burden of the world and find joy.</v>

319
00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:20.720
<v Speaker 1>Look for your inspiration to the victorious lobster with its 350 million years</v>

320
00:15:20.721 --> 00:15:21.740
<v Speaker 1>of practical wisdom.</v>

321
00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:24.860
<v Speaker 1>Stand up straight with your shoulders back.</v>
