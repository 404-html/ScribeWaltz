1
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:07.921
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2
00:00:07.921 --> 00:00:09.950
<v Speaker 1>so let me ask you another question about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that then.</v>

3
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.360
<v Speaker 1>So she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the problems that I've had</v>

4
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.630
<v Speaker 1>because I've been trying to look out at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

5
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.680
<v Speaker 1>the potential for our true relationship</v>
<v Speaker 1>between Islam and Christianity.</v>

6
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.630
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the degree that I understand Islam or</v>

7
00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:24.210
<v Speaker 1>Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which of course there's plenty to</v>

8
00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:26.550
<v Speaker 1>understand about both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's no easy thing to manage.</v>

9
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.380
<v Speaker 1>But there is this claim as well that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's widespread and rather vague</v>

10
00:00:31.381 --> 00:00:34.650
<v Speaker 1>that that Islam is in essence a religion</v>
<v Speaker 1>of peace.</v>

11
00:00:34.651 --> 00:00:37.650
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I look at the historical data,</v>

12
00:00:37.651 --> 00:00:42.651
<v Speaker 1>say stemming from Medina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Medina time and then moving forward</v>

13
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.560
<v Speaker 1>and the fact that Muhammad was</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely someone who engaged</v>

14
00:00:46.561 --> 00:00:49.950
<v Speaker 1>personally in warfare and in an</v>
<v Speaker 1>expansionist warfare,</v>

15
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.310
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not an easy thing for me to make</v>

16
00:00:53.311 --> 00:00:57.750
<v Speaker 1>the leap to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to comprehending or being able to accept</v>

17
00:00:57.751 --> 00:01:00.960
<v Speaker 1>the claim that the fundamental doctrines</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Islam are peaceful,</v>

18
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.771
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

19
00:01:01.771 --> 00:01:03.210
<v Speaker 1>are associated with piece.</v>

20
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.240
<v Speaker 1>Because it looks to me like there's an</v>
<v Speaker 1>element of it that's quite militaristic.</v>

21
00:01:06.241 --> 00:01:10.320
<v Speaker 1>And I've also thought that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say there's a religious element to</v>

22
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.970
<v Speaker 1>Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean this is not an original</v>

23
00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:14.040
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously there's a religious element to</v>

24
00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:15.690
<v Speaker 1>Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's also something that's</v>

25
00:01:15.691 --> 00:01:19.740
<v Speaker 1>clearly more like a political movement</v>
<v Speaker 1>and more like a governmental movement.</v>

26
00:01:19.741 --> 00:01:23.820
<v Speaker 1>And that's also complicated by the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there isn't any clear separation</v>

27
00:01:23.821 --> 00:01:26.850
<v Speaker 1>between church and state in Islamic</v>
<v Speaker 1>doctrine as far as I can tell.</v>

28
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.380
<v Speaker 1>So when we hear claims that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when claims are made that Islam is</v>

29
00:01:31.381 --> 00:01:35.520
<v Speaker 1>essentially a religion of peace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that doesn't seem to be the case</v>

30
00:01:35.521 --> 00:01:40.521
<v Speaker 1>with the Medina end of the theological</v>
<v Speaker 1>discourse or the actions that that</v>

31
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.740
<v Speaker 1>emerged thereof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then part of the problem is how do</v>

32
00:01:43.741 --> 00:01:47.430
<v Speaker 1>you reconcile that with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>contradictions in relationship to the</v>

33
00:01:47.431 --> 00:01:48.510
<v Speaker 1>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier,</v>

34
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.390
<v Speaker 1>as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meccan doctrines and it isn't clear to</v>

35
00:01:51.391 --> 00:01:52.740
<v Speaker 1>me how that can be done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

36
00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.990
<v Speaker 2>mostly as a political community that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>believers should.</v>

37
00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.130
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are in that position today.</v>

38
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.770
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

39
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.470
<v Speaker 2>That did not give you the lessons</v>
<v Speaker 2>choice.</v>

40
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.150
<v Speaker 2>He's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or can have your brides are like,</v>

41
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.930
<v Speaker 2>his message was you guys are Washington</v>
<v Speaker 2>follow spots.</v>

42
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.830
<v Speaker 2>These are items you live in a time and</v>
<v Speaker 2>signals and I left the last message</v>

43
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.250
<v Speaker 2>conveyed to you</v>
<v Speaker 2>the light and enlightenment and come</v>

44
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.930
<v Speaker 2>with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No please.</v>

45
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.230
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] records.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lots of messages.</v>

46
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.310
<v Speaker 2>It's the fact that cooking apply of</v>
<v Speaker 2>course,</v>

47
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.890
<v Speaker 2>fortunately the other end of the mixture</v>
<v Speaker 2>attacker,</v>

48
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.020
<v Speaker 2>the records described</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Rosina,</v>

49
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.420
<v Speaker 2>yes he does that</v>

50
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.320
<v Speaker 3>walk the wall.</v>

51
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.380
<v Speaker 2>The numbers were [inaudible] and these</v>
<v Speaker 2>are people who come from of them.</v>

52
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.320
<v Speaker 2>Then you see everywhere where people</v>
<v Speaker 2>access as law,</v>

53
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.770
<v Speaker 2>that is destination seniors live only</v>
<v Speaker 2>after you accept Islam.</v>

54
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.800
<v Speaker 2>As long as you refused to abide by</v>
<v Speaker 2>Islamic law or accept to be subdued by</v>

55
00:03:16.331 --> 00:03:17.780
<v Speaker 2>Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are at war.</v>

56
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.760
<v Speaker 2>That's why they limit make this</v>
<v Speaker 2>distinction between the House of Islam</v>

57
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.040
<v Speaker 2>and the House of war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

58
00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:28.480
<v Speaker 2>And the House of war is everywhere where</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are infidels and it's the job of</v>

59
00:03:28.481 --> 00:03:31.030
<v Speaker 2>the Muslims and the house of peace to</v>
<v Speaker 2>convert.</v>

60
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.950
<v Speaker 1>So it's a religion of peace in so far as</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's final utopian aim is the cessation</v>

61
00:03:37.081 --> 00:03:39.510
<v Speaker 1>of conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the cessation of conflict in</v>

62
00:03:39.511 --> 00:03:43.780
<v Speaker 1>part as a consequence of of conquest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

63
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:44.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

64
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was more or less how I understood</v>

65
00:03:46.171 --> 00:03:48.390
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when the claim is made that it's a</v>

66
00:03:48.391 --> 00:03:50.520
<v Speaker 1>religion of peace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that isn't precisely,</v>

67
00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.400
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a slight of hand in some sense.</v>

68
00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.650
<v Speaker 1>With regards specifically to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>phrase.</v>
