00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:09.530
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Peterson.</v>

2
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.393
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for coming.</v>

3
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:12.161
<v Speaker 1>We all,</v>

4
00:00:12.161 --> 00:00:12.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:13.560
<v Speaker 1>appreciate it a lot.</v>

6
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:14.070
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

7
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.720
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to get your opinion on censorship that we're seeing on the web.</v>

8
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.170
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

9
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.190
<v Speaker 1>it's accelerating.</v>

10
00:00:20.191 --> 00:00:21.690
<v Speaker 1>You were a very notable example.</v>

11
00:00:21.691 --> 00:00:24.760
<v Speaker 1>You were locked out of your Gmail and B and Trump account.</v>

12
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.673
<v Speaker 1>Pardon me?</v>

13
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.941
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

14
00:00:26.941 --> 00:00:29.700
<v Speaker 1>Trump just got a deleted by an air in person,</v>

15
00:00:29.701 --> 00:00:29.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:29.911 --> 00:00:34.050
<v Speaker 1>now they're saying that perhaps this was just a contractor and you know,</v>

17
00:00:34.051 --> 00:00:34.884
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

18
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

19
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.900
<v Speaker 1>someone from Twitter who's gone in a very far left direction,</v>

20
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:40.021
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:00:40.021 --> 00:00:42.330
<v Speaker 1>youtube has gone in a very far left erection.</v>

22
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.051
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

23
00:00:43.051 --> 00:00:43.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm just wondering,</v>

24
00:00:43.951 --> 00:00:44.910
<v Speaker 1>I've started a,</v>

25
00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:47.220
<v Speaker 1>an alternative to youtube called Pew Tube.</v>

26
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.850
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

27
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:48.990
<v Speaker 1>what kind of,</v>

28
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.913
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

29
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.441
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

30
00:00:50.441 --> 00:00:54.610
<v Speaker 1>what do you see for possible solutions and just your thoughts in general or is</v>

31
00:00:54.611 --> 00:00:55.444
<v Speaker 1>it not?</v>

32
00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:56.373
<v Speaker 1>Here's an</v>

33
00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.423
<v Speaker 2>crazy thought,</v>

34
00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.590
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to tell it to you anyways.</v>

35
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:00.101
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

36
00:01:00.101 --> 00:01:02.650
<v Speaker 2>I was just reading one of Ray Kurzweil's books,</v>

37
00:01:02.651 --> 00:01:03.401
<v Speaker 2>I think it was called,</v>

38
00:01:03.401 --> 00:01:04.330
<v Speaker 2>how to make a mind.</v>

39
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.620
<v Speaker 2>I really liked it actually.</v>

40
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.900
<v Speaker 2>It helped me understand how the brain compresses information because the world</v>

41
00:01:10.901 --> 00:01:11.820
<v Speaker 2>is really complicated,</v>

42
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.610
<v Speaker 2>so you have to make a low resolution representation of it to live in it.</v>

43
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.390
<v Speaker 2>And he actually explained to me in a way that I hadn't really understood how the</v>

44
00:01:19.391 --> 00:01:21.130
<v Speaker 2>brain might do that neurologically.</v>

45
00:01:21.131 --> 00:01:21.964
<v Speaker 2>So that was cool.</v>

46
00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.451
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

47
00:01:22.451 --> 00:01:25.450
<v Speaker 2>Kurt's while this guy who thinks that he's a smart guy,</v>

48
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.440
<v Speaker 2>a very smart guy and uh,</v>

49
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.680
<v Speaker 2>he's invented a fair bit of high end technical technological,</v>

50
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:33.563
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

51
00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.510
<v Speaker 2>software and hardware and he's the guy that thinks that we're heading towards</v>

52
00:01:37.511 --> 00:01:38.350
<v Speaker 2>the singularity.</v>

53
00:01:38.351 --> 00:01:39.700
<v Speaker 2>And so the singularity is,</v>

54
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:40.121
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

55
00:01:40.121 --> 00:01:45.121
<v Speaker 2>how processing speed doubles every 18 months and like hard disk capacity every</v>

56
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.400
<v Speaker 2>year and there's a bunch of doublings going on,</v>

57
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.720
<v Speaker 2>a huge number of them and they accelerate exponentially.</v>

58
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.210
<v Speaker 2>And so it's probably,</v>

59
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.770
<v Speaker 2>we're probably three years away,</v>

60
00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.200
<v Speaker 2>maybe even less then from building a computer that has,</v>

61
00:02:01.201 --> 00:02:06.201
<v Speaker 2>is the capacity to make as many calculations as reasonable estimates of the</v>

62
00:02:06.701 --> 00:02:08.860
<v Speaker 2>calculating capacity of the human brain are,</v>

63
00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:11.800
<v Speaker 2>are currently set up 18 months away,</v>

64
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.571
<v Speaker 2>two years away,</v>

65
00:02:13.571 --> 00:02:14.470
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

66
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.020
<v Speaker 2>And then we're 18 months away from having one that's twice that fast and then 18</v>

67
00:02:20.021 --> 00:02:22.360
<v Speaker 2>months away from having one that's twice as fast as that.</v>

68
00:02:22.361 --> 00:02:24.070
<v Speaker 2>So that's like say six years</v>

69
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.050
<v Speaker 2>and we've got something that's eight times as smart as a human being.</v>

70
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.210
<v Speaker 2>But there's a twist on that.</v>

71
00:02:31.211 --> 00:02:32.650
<v Speaker 2>And this is Kurt swells twist,</v>

72
00:02:32.651 --> 00:02:35.590
<v Speaker 2>which is as soon as you make a machine smart enough to make the next machine</v>

73
00:02:35.591 --> 00:02:36.670
<v Speaker 2>that's smarter than it,</v>

74
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.030
<v Speaker 2>which is sort of what we're doing because computers are so fast that that will</v>

75
00:02:42.131 --> 00:02:46.150
<v Speaker 2>scale up to near infinite computing computing power almost instantaneously.</v>

76
00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.480
<v Speaker 2>Now you think?</v>

77
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.961
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

78
00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:50.651
<v Speaker 2>probably not.</v>

79
00:02:50.651 --> 00:02:52.190
<v Speaker 2>And Allen,</v>

80
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.950
<v Speaker 2>Bob Gates partner has written critiques of Kurtzweil while and you know,</v>

81
00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 2>you might think if something's impossible then it won't even if you don't know</v>

82
00:03:00.071 --> 00:03:00.431
<v Speaker 2>why.</v>

83
00:03:00.431 --> 00:03:03.700
<v Speaker 2>And there's reasons to not think that that will happen.</v>

84
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.730
<v Speaker 2>But Kurzweil's traced back the doubling of computing power way before the</v>

85
00:03:09.101 --> 00:03:12.780
<v Speaker 2>existence of the transistor and it's been ridiculously stable,</v>

86
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:13.990
<v Speaker 2>crazily stable.</v>

87
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.500
<v Speaker 2>So God only knows what we're coming up with here.</v>

88
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.640
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

89
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.150
<v Speaker 2>and you don't know what something of infinite computing power might be like.</v>

90
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.640
<v Speaker 2>Like you seriously don't know.</v>

91
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.550
<v Speaker 2>And there are serious people who are very,</v>

92
00:03:27.551 --> 00:03:28.001
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

93
00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:29.320
<v Speaker 2>very worried about that.</v>

94
00:03:29.321 --> 00:03:30.041
<v Speaker 2>They're very worried,</v>

95
00:03:30.041 --> 00:03:30.611
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

96
00:03:30.611 --> 00:03:34.420
<v Speaker 2>that companies like Facebook and Google will manage that first.</v>

97
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:35.381
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

98
00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:38.950
<v Speaker 2>those companies are already making censorship AI bots.</v>

99
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.091
<v Speaker 2>And that's what,</v>

100
00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:40.780
<v Speaker 2>that's smart.</v>

101
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.510
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of like making really fast robots that can shoot people.</v>

102
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:44.710
<v Speaker 2>It's not that smart.</v>

103
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.810
<v Speaker 2>And we're doing that to very rapidly.</v>

104
00:03:46.811 --> 00:03:47.381
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

105
00:03:47.381 --> 00:03:50.980
<v Speaker 2>I know some guys who work in advanced AI and you know how you look,</v>

106
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.550
<v Speaker 2>you watch the term terminator movies and you see the robots that miss when they</v>

107
00:03:54.551 --> 00:03:55.384
<v Speaker 2>shoot at you.</v>

108
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.620
<v Speaker 2>Like they're not very bright because the bright ones not only shoot at where you</v>

109
00:03:59.621 --> 00:03:59.891
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

110
00:03:59.891 --> 00:04:02.680
<v Speaker 2>but they estimate where you're going to be when you make your escape moves and</v>

111
00:04:02.681 --> 00:04:07.681
<v Speaker 2>they shoot their simultaneously and their death rate is 100% and so there's no</v>

112
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.080
<v Speaker 2>war against the robots.</v>

113
00:04:11.081 --> 00:04:11.351
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

114
00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:12.340
<v Speaker 2>when those things get going,</v>

115
00:04:12.341 --> 00:04:15.160
<v Speaker 2>they're going to be so much faster than us that will look like we're moving</v>

116
00:04:15.161 --> 00:04:16.390
<v Speaker 2>through molasses to them.</v>

117
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.853
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

118
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.921
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

119
00:04:21.921 --> 00:04:25.310
<v Speaker 2>so maybe what we're deciding now with all of our individual decisions about</v>

120
00:04:25.311 --> 00:04:28.070
<v Speaker 2>censorship and the way that we're going to construct the world and all that is</v>

121
00:04:28.071 --> 00:04:31.280
<v Speaker 2>exactly what kind of super intelligence we're going to bring into being.</v>

122
00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.480
<v Speaker 2>And I would suggest that we try to bring one in that's good and moral rather</v>

123
00:04:35.481 --> 00:04:37.520
<v Speaker 2>than one that's evil and demonic,</v>

124
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:40.063
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

125
00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.060
<v Speaker 2>So what can we do about that?</v>

126
00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:49.970
<v Speaker 2>There's only one answer to that.</v>

127
00:04:49.971 --> 00:04:53.840
<v Speaker 2>As far as I know that that works is gay rock together.</v>

128
00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.230
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be the person who's working in Ai,</v>

129
00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:58.363
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

130
00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.020
<v Speaker 2>I know some of these people,</v>

131
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.770
<v Speaker 2>they better be good people because they're going to build whatever they're like</v>

132
00:05:03.771 --> 00:05:04.730
<v Speaker 2>into their machines.</v>

133
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.600
<v Speaker 2>They better have their head screwed on straight cause they're going to get</v>

134
00:05:08.601 --> 00:05:09.980
<v Speaker 2>amplified like math.</v>

135
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.090
<v Speaker 2>And I don't like what's happening with Google and Facebook and Youtube,</v>

136
00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.980
<v Speaker 2>they're building censorship bots predicated on a certain kind of ideology and</v>

137
00:05:17.981 --> 00:05:20.090
<v Speaker 2>the kind of ideology that we outlined today.</v>

138
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.220
<v Speaker 2>It's a very bad idea.</v>

139
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.220
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully good people will stop that.</v>

140
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.051
<v Speaker 2>So then that,</v>

141
00:05:31.051 --> 00:05:34.350
<v Speaker 2>what that means is that your moral obligation is to be good.</v>

142
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.460
<v Speaker 2>And the way you do that is first by stopping being bad.</v>

143
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.830
<v Speaker 2>And everyone can do that a little bit.</v>

144
00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.460
<v Speaker 2>So I hope that's what everyone does because the consequences of not doing it are</v>

145
00:05:47.041 --> 00:05:48.300
<v Speaker 2>not going to be pleasant.</v>

146
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.163
<v Speaker 2>They never are.</v>

147
00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:51.583
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

148
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.880
<v Speaker 2>Hi.</v>

149
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:54.161
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

150
00:05:54.161 --> 00:05:56.400
<v Speaker 2>this question is about your biblical lecture series.</v>

151
00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.003
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

152
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.170
<v Speaker 2>I liked that one because it's about genesis,</v>

153
00:06:00.171 --> 00:06:02.830
<v Speaker 2>which is usually ignored as being,</v>

154
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.000
<v Speaker 2>we're this post enlightenment society,</v>

155
00:06:05.001 --> 00:06:06.680
<v Speaker 2>you don't need these ancient creation myths.</v>

156
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.820
<v Speaker 2>And also I thought revelations kind of gets the same treatment as being</v>

157
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.860
<v Speaker 2>dismissed because it's the crazy hallucinogenic trip.</v>

158
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.890
<v Speaker 2>That's why some isolated mad man in the middle of the Mediterranean.</v>

159
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.710
<v Speaker 2>So I was wondering if after you're done with genesis,</v>

160
00:06:21.711 --> 00:06:23.630
<v Speaker 2>if you were thinking about doing revelations,</v>

161
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:25.580
<v Speaker 2>not without traversing the,</v>

162
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:27.860
<v Speaker 2>the geography in between.</v>

163
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:29.173
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

164
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:29.901
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

165
00:06:29.901 --> 00:06:33.080
<v Speaker 2>I want to walk through the whole thing if I can do that before I expire.</v>

166
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.110
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

167
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.411
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

168
00:06:36.411 --> 00:06:40.760
<v Speaker 2>I've read it and thought about it and it's such a strange book,</v>

169
00:06:40.761 --> 00:06:45.170
<v Speaker 2>a because it's really big among the evangelical Republican types and you'd think</v>

170
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.153
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

171
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.460
<v Speaker 2>really that's the book that's,</v>

172
00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.630
<v Speaker 2>but you're relying on,</v>

173
00:06:49.631 --> 00:06:50.540
<v Speaker 2>have you read it?</v>

174
00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:51.420
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

175
00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:51.910
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

176
00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:52.191
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

177
00:06:52.191 --> 00:06:52.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

178
00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:53.420
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

179
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.430
<v Speaker 2>it's a crazy hallucinogenic trip.</v>

180
00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.290
<v Speaker 2>That's what revelation is now.</v>

181
00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:02.320
<v Speaker 2>That's not to play it down because God only knows about crazy hallucinogenic</v>

182
00:07:03.351 --> 00:07:04.184
<v Speaker 2>trips,</v>

183
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:05.240
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>

184
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:06.163
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>

185
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.030
<v Speaker 2>there's accruing evidence.</v>

186
00:07:08.031 --> 00:07:12.620
<v Speaker 2>I would say that a tremendous amount of the religious orientation of human</v>

187
00:07:12.621 --> 00:07:13.101
<v Speaker 2>beings,</v>

188
00:07:13.101 --> 00:07:13.311
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

189
00:07:13.311 --> 00:07:14.960
<v Speaker 2>that deep mythological,</v>

190
00:07:14.961 --> 00:07:19.280
<v Speaker 2>symbolic orientation is in no small part a consequence of humanities</v>

191
00:07:19.281 --> 00:07:21.590
<v Speaker 2>experimentation with psychedelics substances.</v>

192
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.761
<v Speaker 2>I think that's,</v>

193
00:07:22.761 --> 00:07:27.260
<v Speaker 2>that the evidence for that I think has become virtually an overwhelming.</v>

194
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:28.873
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

195
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:30.740
<v Speaker 2>anyways,</v>

196
00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:31.610
<v Speaker 2>I will get there.</v>

197
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.473
<v Speaker 2>Maybe,</v>

198
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.930
<v Speaker 2>probably not because at the rate I'm going through the first stories,</v>

199
00:07:35.931 --> 00:07:37.480
<v Speaker 2>it'll take me forever to get there.</v>

200
00:07:37.481 --> 00:07:38.150
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

201
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:38.983
<v Speaker 2>But that's okay.</v>

202
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:40.700
<v Speaker 2>So thank you.</v>

203
00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:41.593
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

204
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:44.271
<v Speaker 4>Dr. Peterson.</v>

205
00:07:44.271 --> 00:07:44.581
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

206
00:07:44.581 --> 00:07:45.414
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

207
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:46.970
<v Speaker 4>it's great pleasure being here.</v>

208
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:48.620
<v Speaker 4>It's awesome to see you live.</v>

209
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:49.543
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

210
00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:53.660
<v Speaker 4>I basically got into your work's just earlier this year and I had an original</v>

211
00:07:53.661 --> 00:07:54.081
<v Speaker 4>question,</v>

212
00:07:54.081 --> 00:07:56.740
<v Speaker 4>but your talk today kind of made me decide to change my mind.</v>

213
00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:57.633
<v Speaker 4>I was going to ask,</v>

214
00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:58.813
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

215
00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:03.820
<v Speaker 4>do you feel as though would you agree with me and the sentiment that the left</v>

216
00:08:04.041 --> 00:08:09.041
<v Speaker 4>has pushed so hard for total control of our society over the last however many</v>

217
00:08:09.111 --> 00:08:09.944
<v Speaker 4>years?</v>

218
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:13.160
<v Speaker 4>It's almost to a point where saying 2013 was a different time.</v>

219
00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:14.543
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

220
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.960
<v Speaker 4>would you say that because they pushed so hard,</v>

221
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:22.250
<v Speaker 4>they've created this backlash and the backlash created,</v>

222
00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.230
<v Speaker 4>caused them to backlash back again.</v>

223
00:08:24.231 --> 00:08:27.110
<v Speaker 4>So they doubled down with their ideology and then they get,</v>

224
00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:28.970
<v Speaker 4>they lose another argument.</v>

225
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:31.790
<v Speaker 4>They lose another ideological war.</v>

226
00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:36.470
<v Speaker 4>They knew lose another me more and they doubled down and they double down again</v>

227
00:08:36.471 --> 00:08:38.840
<v Speaker 4>and again and they just can't seem to meme,</v>

228
00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.340
<v Speaker 4>they can't seem to argue.</v>

229
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.331
<v Speaker 4>They can't seem,</v>

230
00:08:41.331 --> 00:08:41.840
<v Speaker 4>they can't,</v>

231
00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.820
<v Speaker 4>they don't want to have an intellectual discussion.</v>

232
00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:47.390
<v Speaker 4>And as an interpretation of what you were saying,</v>

233
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:48.290
<v Speaker 4>there is no,</v>

234
00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:49.700
<v Speaker 4>there doesn't seem to be any,</v>

235
00:08:49.701 --> 00:08:50.534
<v Speaker 4>any,</v>

236
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:52.610
<v Speaker 4>any care of what's right with them.</v>

237
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.260
<v Speaker 4>They just want power.</v>

238
00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:55.123
<v Speaker 4>They just want,</v>

239
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:56.550
<v Speaker 4>they just want to win.</v>

240
00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:57.630
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

241
00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:58.463
<v Speaker 4>do you,</v>

242
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.350
<v Speaker 4>would you agree with the sentiment that they're burning themselves out and</v>

243
00:09:01.351 --> 00:09:04.170
<v Speaker 4>creating the mass red pilling of the,</v>

244
00:09:04.171 --> 00:09:04.680
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

245
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.810
<v Speaker 4>conservative movement that we see going on?</v>

246
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:10.260
<v Speaker 4>Would you possibly think to maybe they've committed suicide and,</v>

247
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:12.150
<v Speaker 4>and talks like this,</v>

248
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.500
<v Speaker 4>people like yourself,</v>

249
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:18.530
<v Speaker 4>Ben Shapiro and others who talk to people like what the subjects that we do the</v>

250
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:20.760
<v Speaker 4>taboo of nowadays,</v>

251
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:21.953
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

252
00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.450
<v Speaker 4>possibly that this,</v>

253
00:09:24.451 --> 00:09:26.990
<v Speaker 4>this is the answer to defeat the,</v>

254
00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:29.130
<v Speaker 4>the leftist strangle angle hold</v>

255
00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:29.391
<v Speaker 2>it's on.</v>

256
00:09:29.391 --> 00:09:31.520
<v Speaker 2>Our society will untangle some of that.</v>

257
00:09:31.521 --> 00:09:31.821
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

258
00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:32.720
<v Speaker 2>So first of all,</v>

259
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:33.951
<v Speaker 2>well first of all,</v>

260
00:09:33.951 --> 00:09:37.760
<v Speaker 2>the first observation is a really interesting one because you know that things</v>

261
00:09:37.761 --> 00:09:38.960
<v Speaker 2>can go out of hand very,</v>

262
00:09:38.961 --> 00:09:39.800
<v Speaker 2>very rapidly.</v>

263
00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:40.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

264
00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.430
<v Speaker 2>And the reason they do that is because of positive feedback loops.</v>

265
00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:46.790
<v Speaker 2>Now the thing that Kurzweil talks about is a positive feedback loop.</v>

266
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:50.360
<v Speaker 2>And intelligent machine makes another intelligent machine that makes another</v>

267
00:09:50.361 --> 00:09:51.470
<v Speaker 2>intelligent machine.</v>

268
00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.120
<v Speaker 2>And that's a positive feedback loop.</v>

269
00:09:53.121 --> 00:09:56.780
<v Speaker 2>And that can spiral upwards out of control very rapidly.</v>

270
00:09:56.781 --> 00:09:58.490
<v Speaker 2>And that's when polarization is,</v>

271
00:09:58.491 --> 00:09:59.324
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

272
00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:00.320
<v Speaker 2>I tap you,</v>

273
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:01.490
<v Speaker 2>you tap me,</v>

274
00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.450
<v Speaker 2>I slapped you,</v>

275
00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:03.530
<v Speaker 2>you punch me.</v>

276
00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:05.540
<v Speaker 2>Well up it goes.</v>

277
00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:06.381
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>

278
00:10:06.381 --> 00:10:08.630
<v Speaker 2>I think that's partly why in the New Testament,</v>

279
00:10:08.631 --> 00:10:09.171
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

280
00:10:09.171 --> 00:10:12.740
<v Speaker 2>there's an injunction that says turn the other cheek,</v>

281
00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:14.510
<v Speaker 2>resist not evil.</v>

282
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:16.063
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

283
00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:20.480
<v Speaker 2>Because otherwise you get into a positive feedback loop and then you better look</v>

284
00:10:20.481 --> 00:10:22.850
<v Speaker 2>the hell out and things can tilt very,</v>

285
00:10:22.851 --> 00:10:23.684
<v Speaker 2>very rapidly.</v>

286
00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:24.181
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

287
00:10:24.181 --> 00:10:24.801
<v Speaker 2>all you have to do,</v>

288
00:10:24.801 --> 00:10:28.460
<v Speaker 2>look at what happened in World War one new unexpected that it was like one,</v>

289
00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:33.500
<v Speaker 2>one relatively minor member,</v>

290
00:10:33.501 --> 00:10:34.850
<v Speaker 2>I think of the aristocracy,</v>

291
00:10:34.851 --> 00:10:35.930
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly,</v>

292
00:10:35.931 --> 00:10:39.200
<v Speaker 2>was assassinated in one minor little country.</v>

293
00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:40.550
<v Speaker 2>It's like bang,</v>

294
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:42.380
<v Speaker 2>everything fell apart.</v>

295
00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.060
<v Speaker 2>And that's positive feedback loops,</v>

296
00:10:44.061 --> 00:10:44.870
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

297
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:47.030
<v Speaker 2>And so that's what we're in right now and we've got to be,</v>

298
00:10:47.031 --> 00:10:49.070
<v Speaker 2>and that's a really chaotic time.</v>

299
00:10:49.071 --> 00:10:54.071
<v Speaker 2>And so I would say maintain self control and don't aim to win.</v>

300
00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:55.910
<v Speaker 2>Amen.</v>

301
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:56.743
<v Speaker 2>Peace.</v>

302
00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:57.981
<v Speaker 2>Because winning,</v>

303
00:10:57.981 --> 00:10:58.400
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

304
00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.510
<v Speaker 2>that's not peace.</v>

305
00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:01.190
<v Speaker 2>It's better to aim for peace.</v>

306
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:02.210
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

307
00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:06.830
<v Speaker 2>I've got this talk coming up in November 11th I'm quite worried about it because</v>

308
00:11:06.831 --> 00:11:09.830
<v Speaker 2>I know there's going to be protesters there and that they've been emboldened by</v>

309
00:11:09.831 --> 00:11:13.520
<v Speaker 2>the fact that they shut the talk down before and I want to make a video.</v>

310
00:11:13.521 --> 00:11:14.510
<v Speaker 2>I'll probably do it tomorrow,</v>

311
00:11:14.511 --> 00:11:19.490
<v Speaker 2>telling everyone that comes to that meeting to like watch their bloody step and</v>

312
00:11:19.491 --> 00:11:24.491
<v Speaker 2>stay out of the gutter because you just,</v>

313
00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:26.120
<v Speaker 2>we're at,</v>

314
00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:26.900
<v Speaker 2>we're at,</v>

315
00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:30.380
<v Speaker 2>we're at a point now where under the wrong circumstances,</v>

316
00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:33.140
<v Speaker 2>if the wrong person does the wrong thing,</v>

317
00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.840
<v Speaker 2>that the consequences will be very great.</v>

318
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:40.870
<v Speaker 2>Now we can't predict which action is going to precipitate that and or even if</v>

319
00:11:42.501 --> 00:11:43.610
<v Speaker 2>that will happen,</v>

320
00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:47.060
<v Speaker 2>but it's chaotic enough so that it could happen.</v>

321
00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:48.740
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

322
00:11:48.741 --> 00:11:50.960
<v Speaker 2>so govern yourselves accordingly.</v>

323
00:11:50.961 --> 00:11:54.670
<v Speaker 2>Now the problem is is that there are people who would be happy if there was</v>

324
00:11:54.671 --> 00:11:55.960
<v Speaker 2>blood running in the street.</v>

325
00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.350
<v Speaker 2>They're the same sort of people that shoot up high schools or kill innocent,</v>

326
00:11:59.650 --> 00:11:59.951
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

327
00:11:59.951 --> 00:12:04.090
<v Speaker 2>elementary school kids just to show what they're made of and what they believe.</v>

328
00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.500
<v Speaker 2>And that's a big problem.</v>

329
00:12:05.501 --> 00:12:06.880
<v Speaker 2>But for the rest of us,</v>

330
00:12:06.881 --> 00:12:08.920
<v Speaker 2>like hopefully calmer heads can prevail.</v>

331
00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:12.090
<v Speaker 2>And so it really is important not to win it.</v>

332
00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.530
<v Speaker 2>It's like fighting with your wife.</v>

333
00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:16.150
<v Speaker 2>You don't win.</v>

334
00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:19.900
<v Speaker 2>You can't because you have to live with her because you can't win.</v>

335
00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:23.530
<v Speaker 2>But maybe you can solve the problem and bring about peace.</v>

336
00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:25.960
<v Speaker 2>And so you've got to practice doing that.</v>

337
00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.160
<v Speaker 2>Practice restraint.</v>

338
00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:28.660
<v Speaker 2>And remember too,</v>

339
00:12:28.661 --> 00:12:32.680
<v Speaker 2>that these people that you're talking about who had radical leftists is most of</v>

340
00:12:32.681 --> 00:12:33.131
<v Speaker 2>the time,</v>

341
00:12:33.131 --> 00:12:37.270
<v Speaker 2>they're not like they're 95% like you.</v>

342
00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:38.860
<v Speaker 2>And if you pull them out of the mob,</v>

343
00:12:38.861 --> 00:12:40.780
<v Speaker 2>they're just like your,</v>

344
00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:45.250
<v Speaker 2>your neighbor's 19 year old kid who's kind of clueless and rebellious,</v>

345
00:12:45.251 --> 00:12:45.700
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

346
00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:49.090
<v Speaker 2>And who you might even like you put them in the mob.</v>

347
00:12:49.091 --> 00:12:50.140
<v Speaker 2>It's a whole different thing.</v>

348
00:12:50.141 --> 00:12:52.050
<v Speaker 2>And so you got to remember that too.</v>

349
00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:52.390
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

350
00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:53.680
<v Speaker 2>this fear of social isolation,</v>

351
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:55.750
<v Speaker 2>kind of how they're acting,</v>

352
00:12:55.751 --> 00:12:56.890
<v Speaker 2>how you say no,</v>

353
00:12:56.891 --> 00:12:59.470
<v Speaker 2>it's just that they're possessed by these ideas,</v>

354
00:12:59.471 --> 00:12:59.830
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

355
00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:01.270
<v Speaker 2>but only partially,</v>

356
00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:02.313
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

357
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:05.320
<v Speaker 2>you hardly find it full blooded.</v>

358
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:08.860
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely committed radical leftist activist.</v>

359
00:13:08.861 --> 00:13:09.101
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

360
00:13:09.101 --> 00:13:10.060
<v Speaker 2>like there are some,</v>

361
00:13:10.061 --> 00:13:10.841
<v Speaker 2>but not very many.</v>

362
00:13:10.841 --> 00:13:11.321
<v Speaker 2>Most of it.</v>

363
00:13:11.321 --> 00:13:14.050
<v Speaker 2>It's just fragmentary behavior.</v>

364
00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:17.920
<v Speaker 2>And you have to remember that like when the students come out to protest me was</v>

365
00:13:17.921 --> 00:13:18.311
<v Speaker 2>a case,</v>

366
00:13:18.311 --> 00:13:19.730
<v Speaker 2>particularly at McMaster,</v>

367
00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:23.650
<v Speaker 2>have to remember these kids,</v>

368
00:13:23.651 --> 00:13:25.720
<v Speaker 2>they're not much different than my kids.</v>

369
00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:30.070
<v Speaker 2>They are when they're in a stupid mob behind a hammer and sickle flag,</v>

370
00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:30.671
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

371
00:13:30.671 --> 00:13:31.240
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

372
00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:31.600
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

373
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:32.433
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

374
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.700
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to make a low resolution,</v>

375
00:13:36.701 --> 00:13:38.830
<v Speaker 2>homogenous representation of them.</v>

376
00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:40.683
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

377
00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:41.853
<v Speaker 2>and so you,</v>

378
00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:42.940
<v Speaker 2>that's why again,</v>

379
00:13:42.941 --> 00:13:44.050
<v Speaker 2>I think instead of winning,</v>

380
00:13:44.051 --> 00:13:45.940
<v Speaker 2>you turn to your own development.</v>

381
00:13:45.941 --> 00:13:47.260
<v Speaker 2>You turn to your own development,</v>

382
00:13:47.261 --> 00:13:51.340
<v Speaker 2>you do what you can to stop doing the things that you're doing that aren't good</v>

383
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:53.020
<v Speaker 2>because you're not going to hurt anybody.</v>

384
00:13:53.021 --> 00:13:53.681
<v Speaker 2>If you do that,</v>

385
00:13:53.681 --> 00:13:54.850
<v Speaker 2>all you're going to do is help.</v>

386
00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:58.060
<v Speaker 2>And otherwise you'll participate in this polarization.</v>

387
00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:01.810
<v Speaker 2>And that's unless you want that.</v>

388
00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:02.531
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

389
00:14:02.531 --> 00:14:06.910
<v Speaker 2>there's a dark part of people that it's part of the part that voted for Trump</v>

390
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.770
<v Speaker 2>would like to burn things to the ground.</v>

391
00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:09.820
<v Speaker 2>It's like to hell.</v>

392
00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:12.190
<v Speaker 2>I know how people felt when they went into the voting booth.</v>

393
00:14:12.191 --> 00:14:13.240
<v Speaker 2>It was like Hillary,</v>

394
00:14:13.241 --> 00:14:14.380
<v Speaker 2>Hillary dealt with it.</v>

395
00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:15.213
<v Speaker 2>Trump,</v>

396
00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:15.611
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

397
00:14:15.611 --> 00:14:16.300
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

398
00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.310
<v Speaker 2>that's a hell of a thing to say to hell with it.</v>

399
00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:19.480
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

400
00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:20.050
<v Speaker 2>although I could,</v>

401
00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:22.180
<v Speaker 2>I could certainly understand that sentiment.</v>

402
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:27.550
<v Speaker 2>So we have to be careful and all of you people who are here,</v>

403
00:14:27.551 --> 00:14:32.551
<v Speaker 2>who are advocates of free speech and who are theoretically happy to come hear me</v>

404
00:14:33.431 --> 00:14:33.881
<v Speaker 2>speak.</v>

405
00:14:33.881 --> 00:14:34.241
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

406
00:14:34.241 --> 00:14:35.200
<v Speaker 2>I really do believe in,</v>

407
00:14:35.201 --> 00:14:38.410
<v Speaker 2>I truly believe this and this is something I learned in part from social knits</v>

408
00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:42.880
<v Speaker 2>and apart from y'all I that the way that you set the world straight is by</v>

409
00:14:42.881 --> 00:14:46.090
<v Speaker 2>constraining the malevolence in your own heart.</v>

410
00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.440
<v Speaker 2>And that's no joke,</v>

411
00:14:47.441 --> 00:14:47.741
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

412
00:14:47.741 --> 00:14:50.980
<v Speaker 2>That's no easy thing and that's a good voyage,</v>

413
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:54.110
<v Speaker 2>people to go on if they want something difficult and worthwhile to do.</v>

414
00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:56.840
<v Speaker 2>So thank you very much.</v>

415
00:14:58.330 --> 00:14:58.880
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

416
00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.320
<v Speaker 2>just a quick thing.</v>

417
00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:00.920
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

418
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.110
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to have time for pictures so you're,</v>

419
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:04.250
<v Speaker 2>unless you're,</v>

420
00:15:04.251 --> 00:15:05.510
<v Speaker 2>yours is the last question.</v>

421
00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:05.961
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

422
00:15:05.961 --> 00:15:07.550
<v Speaker 2>So sorry to everybody else,</v>

423
00:15:07.551 --> 00:15:08.690
<v Speaker 2>but you're the last one.</v>

424
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:09.703
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

425
00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:14.300
<v Speaker 2>Hi,</v>

426
00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:14.870
<v Speaker 2>doctor said,</v>

427
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:15.610
<v Speaker 2>thanks for coming.</v>

428
00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:15.980
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

429
00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:20.090
<v Speaker 2>my question is a little bit off topic from everything else tonight,</v>

430
00:15:20.091 --> 00:15:22.040
<v Speaker 2>but I really wanted to hear what you had to say about it.</v>

431
00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:22.500
<v Speaker 2>Um.</v>
