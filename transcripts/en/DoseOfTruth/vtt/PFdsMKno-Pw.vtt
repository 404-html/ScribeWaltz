1
00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:07.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.940
<v Speaker 2>You Josh Gates.</v>

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.451
<v Speaker 2>Oh good.</v>

4
00:00:09.451 --> 00:00:10.284
<v Speaker 2>Josh,</v>

5
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.490
<v Speaker 2>ask me an easy question.</v>

6
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.820
<v Speaker 2>Young suggested that the Christian Myth failed to articulate Christ descended</v>

7
00:00:17.241 --> 00:00:21.840
<v Speaker 2>into hell and that this resulted in the mass shadow projection of the West.</v>

8
00:00:21.841 --> 00:00:22.674
<v Speaker 2>Thoughts?</v>

9
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:28.363
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

11
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to refer to my book again.</v>

12
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.230
<v Speaker 2>I talked about this and rule seven,</v>

13
00:00:33.231 --> 00:00:34.550
<v Speaker 2>pursue what is meaningful,</v>

14
00:00:34.551 --> 00:00:35.690
<v Speaker 2>not what is expedient.</v>

15
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.080
<v Speaker 2>In that Chapter I discussed there's this idea in Christianity that Christ took</v>

16
00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:45.590
<v Speaker 2>the sins of the world onto himself and I think that's very much related to the</v>

17
00:00:45.591 --> 00:00:47.330
<v Speaker 2>idea of descent into hell.</v>

18
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.460
<v Speaker 2>They're not exactly the same thing,</v>

19
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.870
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

20
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.920
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to address the first one and it will shed light on the second.</v>

21
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.600
<v Speaker 2>So what does it mean that the Messiah is archetype Lee?</v>

22
00:01:01.601 --> 00:01:05.080
<v Speaker 2>The figure who takes the sins of the world onto himself,</v>

23
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.970
<v Speaker 2>what it means practically speaking or psychologically speaking.</v>

24
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.940
<v Speaker 2>And I've tried this with some of my clients who were very naive.</v>

25
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.310
<v Speaker 2>It means to read the history of the world as if you were the perpetrator of the</v>

26
00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:22.630
<v Speaker 2>evils that you read about instead of the victim or the noble intervener.</v>

27
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:23.733
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

28
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.710
<v Speaker 2>I talked to somebody the other day about the movie Schindler's List and</v>

29
00:01:26.711 --> 00:01:30.580
<v Speaker 2>Schindler was this German industrialist who saved a very large number of Jews</v>

30
00:01:30.581 --> 00:01:32.950
<v Speaker 2>that were in danger of well endanger of,</v>

31
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.430
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

32
00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:34.240
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

33
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.470
<v Speaker 2>of the final solution.</v>

34
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.450
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things he said was,</v>

35
00:01:37.451 --> 00:01:37.691
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

36
00:01:37.691 --> 00:01:37.931
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

37
00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:39.400
<v Speaker 2>when people watch Schindler's list,</v>

38
00:01:39.401 --> 00:01:42.880
<v Speaker 2>they always think they'd be Schindler and on if they don't think they'd be</v>

39
00:01:42.881 --> 00:01:43.301
<v Speaker 2>Schindler,</v>

40
00:01:43.301 --> 00:01:45.940
<v Speaker 2>maybe they think they'd be the Jewish victim of the Nazis,</v>

41
00:01:45.941 --> 00:01:49.060
<v Speaker 2>but they almost never think that they'd be the Nazi persecutor.</v>

42
00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.870
<v Speaker 2>And that's a big mistake because when you read about history,</v>

43
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.140
<v Speaker 2>then you're reading about you,</v>

44
00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.380
<v Speaker 2>even if the you is the perpetrator.</v>

45
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.420
<v Speaker 2>And unless you understand that,</v>

46
00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:03.460
<v Speaker 2>then someone else has to be the perpetrator.</v>

47
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.770
<v Speaker 2>And if someone else is the perpetrator,</v>

48
00:02:05.771 --> 00:02:08.890
<v Speaker 2>well then you have a devil that you can chase and you know,</v>

49
00:02:08.891 --> 00:02:12.640
<v Speaker 2>maybe you've identified the devil properly because you know now and then it's</v>

50
00:02:12.641 --> 00:02:15.850
<v Speaker 2>like John Wayne Gacy or Ted Bundy or someone like that.</v>

51
00:02:15.851 --> 00:02:16.541
<v Speaker 2>And you've actually,</v>

52
00:02:16.541 --> 00:02:16.781
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

53
00:02:16.781 --> 00:02:18.310
<v Speaker 2>you've identified the perpetrator.</v>

54
00:02:18.311 --> 00:02:19.580
<v Speaker 2>But so often,</v>

55
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:21.400
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

56
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.540
<v Speaker 2>far too often</v>

57
00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.340
<v Speaker 2>the best way to constrain the malevolence outside is to constrain the</v>

58
00:02:27.341 --> 00:02:28.350
<v Speaker 2>malevolence within.</v>

59
00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.410
<v Speaker 2>And so if you don't have a locale for the evil of the world and you have to</v>

60
00:02:32.411 --> 00:02:35.950
<v Speaker 2>externalize it because the evil of the world certainly exists now,</v>

61
00:02:35.951 --> 00:02:40.951
<v Speaker 2>it's a better solution to assume that your</v>

62
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.820
<v Speaker 2>fully capable of the terrible things that people have been capable of throat,</v>

63
00:02:48.821 --> 00:02:49.990
<v Speaker 2>the history of humanity,</v>

64
00:02:49.991 --> 00:02:52.120
<v Speaker 2>and to contend with that genuinely.</v>

65
00:02:52.121 --> 00:02:54.400
<v Speaker 2>And there's massive advantages to that.</v>

66
00:02:54.401 --> 00:02:54.641
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

67
00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:55.121
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

68
00:02:55.121 --> 00:03:00.121
<v Speaker 2>it can actually produce and remarkable increment self esteem because you know,</v>

69
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.530
<v Speaker 2>if you're just a rabbit and you freeze whenever a wolf looks at you,</v>

70
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.870
<v Speaker 2>then you're just a frozen rabbit and that's not so good.</v>

71
00:03:07.871 --> 00:03:08.980
<v Speaker 2>You're just a scared rabbit.</v>

72
00:03:08.981 --> 00:03:12.310
<v Speaker 2>But maybe you learn one day that you're not a rabbit that you like,</v>

73
00:03:12.311 --> 00:03:15.160
<v Speaker 2>you're actually quite the damn monster and you've got teeth and you could really</v>

74
00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:17.050
<v Speaker 2>use them in an underhanded and horrible way.</v>

75
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.790
<v Speaker 2>This is why people like anti hero movie so much hay because they go and see the</v>

76
00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:22.331
<v Speaker 2>villains,</v>

77
00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:26.350
<v Speaker 2>the mafia guys and these tough guys and they antiheroes that populate our</v>

78
00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:27.460
<v Speaker 2>imagination and think,</v>

79
00:03:27.461 --> 00:03:27.940
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

80
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.310
<v Speaker 2>well I'd really read it like to be someone like that.</v>

81
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.270
<v Speaker 2>And the thing is,</v>

82
00:03:31.271 --> 00:03:33.280
<v Speaker 2>is that being useless and week,</v>

83
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.220
<v Speaker 2>it's better to be a monster then to be useless and weak.</v>

84
00:03:36.221 --> 00:03:39.400
<v Speaker 2>And that's because being useless and weak makes you a worst monster then a</v>

85
00:03:39.401 --> 00:03:39.940
<v Speaker 2>monster.</v>

86
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.580
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's not like being a monster is good,</v>

87
00:03:42.581 --> 00:03:43.420
<v Speaker 2>but weak,</v>

88
00:03:43.421 --> 00:03:46.840
<v Speaker 2>useless monster is the worst kind of monster because that's a sort of monster.</v>

89
00:03:46.841 --> 00:03:50.830
<v Speaker 2>A little jump in the dark and sink its teeth into the back of your neck instead</v>

90
00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:53.020
<v Speaker 2>of confronting you forthrightly in the alley.</v>

91
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.250
<v Speaker 2>And so if you start to see yourself as the perpetrator of historical</v>

92
00:03:57.251 --> 00:03:57.881
<v Speaker 2>malevolence,</v>

93
00:03:57.881 --> 00:03:58.091
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

94
00:03:58.091 --> 00:04:00.640
<v Speaker 2>if you can imagine yourself as an Auschwitz camp guard,</v>

95
00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:02.440
<v Speaker 2>if you see yourself as,</v>

96
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:03.310
<v Speaker 2>as the,</v>

97
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.720
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

98
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.010
<v Speaker 2>the vicious villain of the human story,</v>

99
00:04:06.011 --> 00:04:08.680
<v Speaker 2>then all of a sudden you've got a lot more respect for yourself and you can</v>

100
00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:11.590
<v Speaker 2>unlock that internal monster and not internal monster.</v>

101
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.770
<v Speaker 2>And then maybe you can tame the damn thing or at least bring it in,</v>

102
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.170
<v Speaker 2>bring it into some sort of partnership with yourself.</v>

103
00:04:17.171 --> 00:04:18.700
<v Speaker 2>And then when someone pushes you around,</v>

104
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.630
<v Speaker 2>you can let a little bit of that out in your eyes just a little bit and you can</v>

105
00:04:22.631 --> 00:04:24.700
<v Speaker 2>say it would be better for you.</v>

106
00:04:24.701 --> 00:04:28.060
<v Speaker 2>And for me if you didn't continue to do that and you can actually mean it.</v>

107
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.080
<v Speaker 2>And then actually it will stop because if you let a little bit of that out when</v>

108
00:04:32.081 --> 00:04:33.280
<v Speaker 2>you tell someone to stop,</v>

109
00:04:33.281 --> 00:04:35.770
<v Speaker 2>the probability that they'll stop is extremely high.</v>

110
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:41.130
<v Speaker 2>And then just a tiny like vision of the monster you could become is enough to</v>

111
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.730
<v Speaker 2>keep order in your house.</v>

112
00:04:42.731 --> 00:04:42.881
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

113
00:04:42.881 --> 00:04:43.990
<v Speaker 2>and maybe in your state.</v>

114
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.130
<v Speaker 2>And so the mass shadow projection of the West,</v>

115
00:04:48.131 --> 00:04:48.401
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

116
00:04:48.401 --> 00:04:49.234
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

117
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:50.680
<v Speaker 2>here's another thing.</v>

118
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.590
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things the Christians figured out was that,</v>

119
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.233
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

120
00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.330
<v Speaker 2>the snake in the garden of Eden was also Satan.</v>

121
00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.130
<v Speaker 2>I can't get into that.</v>

122
00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.390
<v Speaker 2>It's too complicated.</v>

123
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.800
<v Speaker 2>You'll have to read chapter seven if you want a full explication of that idea.</v>

124
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.370
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

125
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.950
<v Speaker 2>that's as good an answer as to the question as I can manage.</v>

126
00:05:08.951 --> 00:05:09.784
<v Speaker 2>Tonight,</v>

127
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.020
<v Speaker 2>I spent all day,</v>

128
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:12.370
<v Speaker 2>let's see,</v>

129
00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.821
<v Speaker 2>all day.</v>

130
00:05:12.821 --> 00:05:16.930
<v Speaker 2>I got up at seven and I worked all day till five on this video I told you about.</v>

131
00:05:16.931 --> 00:05:19.330
<v Speaker 2>So I made about 400 anets or something like that.</v>

132
00:05:19.331 --> 00:05:21.790
<v Speaker 2>So I'm a little bit on the burnt outside tonight,</v>

133
00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:23.020
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
