00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:07.730
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

2
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.120
<v Speaker 1>so here's the way of thinking about things.</v>

3
00:00:10.121 --> 00:00:11.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to move through it relatively quickly.</v>

4
00:00:11.981 --> 00:00:12.760
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

5
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.390
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6
00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:14.710
<v Speaker 1>you look through the world,</v>

7
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.920
<v Speaker 1>you look at the world through a frame of reference and the reason you do that in</v>

8
00:00:17.921 --> 00:00:20.530
<v Speaker 1>part is because there's more to the world than you can understand.</v>

9
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.200
<v Speaker 1>And so that would be the actual chaos of the world.</v>

10
00:00:23.201 --> 00:00:24.730
<v Speaker 1>It's like the world is very,</v>

11
00:00:24.731 --> 00:00:25.061
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

12
00:00:25.061 --> 00:00:25.451
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

13
00:00:25.451 --> 00:00:25.841
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

14
00:00:25.841 --> 00:00:27.010
<v Speaker 1>very complicated.</v>

15
00:00:27.011 --> 00:00:29.170
<v Speaker 1>And you know you're a very complicated too,</v>

16
00:00:29.171 --> 00:00:31.030
<v Speaker 1>but you're not as complicated as the world.</v>

17
00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.630
<v Speaker 1>So you're continually surrounded by a chaotic structure that you don't really</v>

18
00:00:34.631 --> 00:00:39.370
<v Speaker 1>understand and you have to frame it in with a frame of reference that only</v>

19
00:00:39.371 --> 00:00:43.990
<v Speaker 1>allows you to see those things that are necessary for you to see at the time of</v>

20
00:00:43.991 --> 00:00:44.890
<v Speaker 1>your given action.</v>

21
00:00:44.891 --> 00:00:45.940
<v Speaker 1>And as far as I can tell,</v>

22
00:00:45.941 --> 00:00:47.860
<v Speaker 1>this is a cybernetic model of personality.</v>

23
00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.060
<v Speaker 1>The elements of that frame or something like this is a basic story.</v>

24
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:53.710
<v Speaker 1>You are somewhere,</v>

25
00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.740
<v Speaker 1>you're located somewhere in time and space always.</v>

26
00:00:56.741 --> 00:01:00.460
<v Speaker 1>You know where that is and you have some sense of the qualities of that</v>

27
00:01:00.461 --> 00:01:01.294
<v Speaker 1>localization.</v>

28
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.300
<v Speaker 1>So people ask you about that because they ask you,</v>

29
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.541
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

30
00:01:04.541 --> 00:01:05.530
<v Speaker 1>how are you doing?</v>

31
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.120
<v Speaker 1>And what they're asking is,</v>

32
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.630
<v Speaker 1>what's your representation of your current state of being?</v>

34
00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.930
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is generally for people.</v>

35
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

36
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:15.161
<v Speaker 1>it's okay,</v>

37
00:01:15.161 --> 00:01:18.280
<v Speaker 1>but it's insufficient because if it wasn't insufficient,</v>

38
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.120
<v Speaker 1>while what,</v>

39
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.450
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

40
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.590
<v Speaker 1>why would you be doing anything?</v>

41
00:01:20.591 --> 00:01:25.450
<v Speaker 1>And then he in principle now isn't good enough because there's something else</v>

42
00:01:25.451 --> 00:01:26.290
<v Speaker 1>that could be better.</v>

43
00:01:26.291 --> 00:01:27.400
<v Speaker 1>And that's what you're pursuing.</v>

44
00:01:27.401 --> 00:01:29.200
<v Speaker 1>And if it's kind of a weird thing,</v>

45
00:01:29.201 --> 00:01:34.120
<v Speaker 1>because it means in some sense that if you weren't dissatisfied permanently,</v>

46
00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.370
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't be motivated to do anything.</v>

47
00:01:36.371 --> 00:01:40.880
<v Speaker 1>And so that's also part of the reason that a lot of human being human experience</v>

48
00:01:40.881 --> 00:01:43.330
<v Speaker 1>is characterized by somewhat negative emotions.</v>

49
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:44.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like this,</v>

50
00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.580
<v Speaker 1>we're permanently dissatisfied.</v>

51
00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:46.773
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

52
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.321
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

53
00:01:47.321 --> 00:01:49.150
<v Speaker 1>because we can act to change things.</v>

54
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.430
<v Speaker 1>So if you're not dissatisfied,</v>

55
00:01:51.431 --> 00:01:52.450
<v Speaker 1>you don't want it to be better.</v>

56
00:01:52.451 --> 00:01:53.440
<v Speaker 1>So in some sense,</v>

57
00:01:53.441 --> 00:01:56.080
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing is looking at the world through a frame that says,</v>

58
00:01:56.081 --> 00:02:01.030
<v Speaker 1>this is what there is and here's how I evaluated and here's what could be.</v>

59
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.260
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I want.</v>

60
00:02:02.261 --> 00:02:04.090
<v Speaker 1>I would like to bring that about.</v>

61
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.991
<v Speaker 1>And so that's,</v>

62
00:02:04.991 --> 00:02:05.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

63
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.180
<v Speaker 1>that's what gives things value.</v>

64
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.320
<v Speaker 1>It gives things value because things that will move you to where you want to go,</v>

65
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.100
<v Speaker 1>they have a positive value and things that get in your way when you're trying to</v>

66
00:02:15.101 --> 00:02:16.150
<v Speaker 1>get to where you want to go,</v>

67
00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.470
<v Speaker 1>they have a negative value.</v>

68
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.780
<v Speaker 1>And so that's partly how your emotions work.</v>

69
00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.610
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

70
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.270
<v Speaker 1>and you can put almost anything in the,</v>

71
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.010
<v Speaker 1>in the box of what should be.</v>
