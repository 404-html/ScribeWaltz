1
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.600
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is the individual instead.</v>

2
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.620
<v Speaker 1>So we have explored territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unexplored territory or the known and</v>

3
00:00:13.621 --> 00:00:18.150
<v Speaker 1>the unknown or order and chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we have the thing that mediates</v>

4
00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:19.800
<v Speaker 1>between them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the individual.</v>

5
00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:22.500
<v Speaker 1>And this is of medieval representation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I really love.</v>

6
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.140
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the dome of the sky there.</v>

7
00:00:25.141 --> 00:00:29.160
<v Speaker 1>It's a very archaic idea that the earth</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a dome because it kind of looks like</v>

8
00:00:29.161 --> 00:00:30.840
<v Speaker 1>that if you go out in a flat field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:34.740
<v Speaker 1>if you're out in the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way the world looks like a dome on a</v>

10
00:00:34.741 --> 00:00:37.080
<v Speaker 1>disk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's sort of the representation</v>

11
00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:38.580
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very ancient idea.</v>

12
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.880
<v Speaker 1>And this guy at the bottom left of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pictures poking his head through the</v>

13
00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:47.760
<v Speaker 1>comprehensible world and looking at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos beyond.</v>

14
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.890
<v Speaker 1>And so he's a heroic figure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the knower is the individual is</v>

15
00:00:52.891 --> 00:00:54.660
<v Speaker 1>always the hero of his story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

16
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.810
<v Speaker 1>The protagonist of a story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it can be an antihero too because</v>

17
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.340
<v Speaker 1>just like the known has a negative</v>
<v Speaker 1>element and a pause development and the</v>

18
00:01:02.341 --> 00:01:04.740
<v Speaker 1>unknown has a negative element and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive element.</v>

19
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.100
<v Speaker 1>The individual has a negative element</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a positive element.</v>

20
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.430
<v Speaker 1>And so there's the hero and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>adversary roughly speaking.</v>

21
00:01:11.431 --> 00:01:14.310
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all sorts of movies where the</v>

22
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.640
<v Speaker 1>protagonist is an Antihero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:01:16.641 --> 00:01:20.910
<v Speaker 1>and those movies are usually there to</v>
<v Speaker 1>show you bad examples in some sense.</v>

24
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.230
<v Speaker 1>Or you get mixed characters like Batman</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's tangled up with the joker.</v>

25
00:01:25.231 --> 00:01:28.770
<v Speaker 1>And as the joker points out in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant performance,</v>

26
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.830
<v Speaker 1>they're mirror images of one another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

27
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.190
<v Speaker 1>the jokers and adversary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

28
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.050
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more complicated than that.</v>

29
00:01:37.051 --> 00:01:42.051
<v Speaker 1>But so some of the symbols that commonly</v>
<v Speaker 1>represent the individual in symbolic</v>

30
00:01:42.121 --> 00:01:45.930
<v Speaker 1>representations are while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also conceptual representations are</v>

31
00:01:45.931 --> 00:01:50.340
<v Speaker 1>ego consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The trickster bugs bunny is a good</v>

32
00:01:50.341 --> 00:01:52.560
<v Speaker 1>example of a trickster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fool,</v>

33
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.590
<v Speaker 1>the hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the coward spirit as opposed to matter</v>

34
00:01:56.591 --> 00:01:58.620
<v Speaker 1>or as opposed to dogma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the son,</v>

35
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.340
<v Speaker 1>the son of the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the son of the king.</v>

36
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.230
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those are very,</v>

37
00:02:04.231 --> 00:02:06.450
<v Speaker 1>very common figures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll walk you through some of that</v>

38
00:02:06.451 --> 00:02:08.550
<v Speaker 1>as we progress today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

39
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.440
<v Speaker 1>and then there's the figure of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>adversary.</v>

40
00:02:10.441 --> 00:02:13.530
<v Speaker 1>So you see on the right hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>left hand side there,</v>

41
00:02:13.531 --> 00:02:14.130
<v Speaker 1>you see.</v>
