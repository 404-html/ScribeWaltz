00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.360
<v Speaker 1>Freaking says fans,</v>

2
00:00:09.361 --> 00:00:11.700
<v Speaker 1>our chancellor for the authentic individual.</v>

3
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.553
<v Speaker 1>Well</v>

4
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.471
<v Speaker 1>that's a tough one.</v>

5
00:00:16.471 --> 00:00:16.831
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6
00:00:16.831 --> 00:00:17.664
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

7
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.200
<v Speaker 1>cancer know that.</v>

8
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.093
<v Speaker 1>That's too,</v>

9
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.440
<v Speaker 1>that's too dramatic.</v>

10
00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.730
<v Speaker 1>I guess that what you're pointing out is the danger of saying,</v>

11
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.680
<v Speaker 1>and I can certainly appreciate that.</v>

12
00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:30.990
<v Speaker 1>I can't say that I'm particularly comfortable with it,</v>

13
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.260
<v Speaker 1>which might seem to be rather hypocritical as it isn't.</v>

14
00:00:34.261 --> 00:00:39.030
<v Speaker 1>Like I've shied away from exposing my views in public.</v>

15
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.033
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

16
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.190
<v Speaker 1>but I felt that I was driven to that by necessity and also by my desire to</v>

17
00:00:44.191 --> 00:00:45.120
<v Speaker 1>educate people.</v>

18
00:00:45.121 --> 00:00:45.954
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

19
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.621
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

20
00:00:46.621 --> 00:00:49.830
<v Speaker 1>I would say despite the fact that I'm somewhat uncomfortable with it,</v>

21
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.980
<v Speaker 1>I think that's mostly because of the responsibility.</v>

22
00:00:52.981 --> 00:00:53.610
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>

23
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.400
<v Speaker 1>I've been terrified for a whole year that I'd say something,</v>

24
00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:56.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

25
00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.380
<v Speaker 1>unforgivably stupid and,</v>

26
00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:59.603
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

27
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.400
<v Speaker 1>demolish myself in public and,</v>

28
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:02.880
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

29
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:03.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

30
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.640
<v Speaker 1>feel guilty and horrible about that for the rest of my life.</v>

31
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.790
<v Speaker 1>And so far it'd be fortunate there's been some close calls,</v>

32
00:01:08.791 --> 00:01:09.780
<v Speaker 1>but I've been fortunate.</v>

33
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.040
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

34
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.810
<v Speaker 1>now when I go places,</v>

35
00:01:12.811 --> 00:01:14.310
<v Speaker 1>people often recognize me.</v>

36
00:01:14.311 --> 00:01:16.560
<v Speaker 1>Even at this little town we went up to this weekend,</v>

37
00:01:16.561 --> 00:01:19.470
<v Speaker 1>there were two people that came up to me in the parking lot and we're excited to</v>

38
00:01:19.471 --> 00:01:19.831
<v Speaker 1>meet me.</v>

39
00:01:19.831 --> 00:01:20.760
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

40
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.770
<v Speaker 1>the vast majority of encounters,</v>

41
00:01:22.771 --> 00:01:26.550
<v Speaker 1>all of the encounters I have with people in public and have been really</v>

42
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.181
<v Speaker 1>wonderful.</v>

43
00:01:27.181 --> 00:01:31.110
<v Speaker 1>I have to say that the people have been extremely friendly and you know,</v>

44
00:01:31.111 --> 00:01:32.730
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they're a bit star struck,</v>

45
00:01:32.731 --> 00:01:34.350
<v Speaker 1>which I find strange.</v>

46
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.820
<v Speaker 1>I can see the projection,</v>

47
00:01:35.821 --> 00:01:36.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:36.894
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>

49
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.310
<v Speaker 1>it's unsettling for me,</v>

50
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.850
<v Speaker 1>although I'm not judging anybody for it.</v>

51
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.510
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

52
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.460
<v Speaker 1>it's just a strange thing to observe.</v>

53
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.893
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

54
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.380
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

55
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.580
<v Speaker 1>I can't complain about the fact that people are,</v>

56
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:51.181
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

57
00:01:51.181 --> 00:01:52.014
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

58
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.913
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

59
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.710
<v Speaker 1>are positively predisposed to what I'm doing.</v>

60
00:01:55.711 --> 00:01:56.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

61
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.210
<v Speaker 1>it's such a privilege.</v>

62
00:01:57.211 --> 00:02:00.330
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine what it would be like to be hated publicly.</v>

63
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:01.770
<v Speaker 1>I think that would just kill me.</v>

64
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:02.760
<v Speaker 1>I really think that.</v>

65
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.570
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

66
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.403
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

67
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.780
<v Speaker 1>so I mean it's,</v>

68
00:02:06.781 --> 00:02:07.320
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

69
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.740
<v Speaker 1>I suppose there's the possibility of having that sort of thing go to your head</v>

70
00:02:10.741 --> 00:02:12.040
<v Speaker 1>and it's it,</v>

71
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.680
<v Speaker 1>and I mean that happens to people,</v>

72
00:02:13.681 --> 00:02:15.930
<v Speaker 1>but I think I've said this before,</v>

73
00:02:15.931 --> 00:02:16.950
<v Speaker 1>maybe on the Q and A's.</v>

74
00:02:16.951 --> 00:02:19.800
<v Speaker 1>I have a pretty sensible family and I have a pretty,</v>

75
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.173
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

76
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:22.763
<v Speaker 1>what would you say?</v>

77
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:24.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

78
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.250
<v Speaker 1>I have a pretty good sense of my limitations.</v>

79
00:02:27.251 --> 00:02:27.960
<v Speaker 1>So I would say,</v>

80
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:28.580
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

81
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.911
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

82
00:02:28.911 --> 00:02:33.911
<v Speaker 1>we could even call it an acute sense and so I'm not particularly worried that</v>

83
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.270
<v Speaker 1>this is going to go to my head in some way that that would</v>

84
00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.343
<v Speaker 2>no</v>

85
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.700
<v Speaker 1>inflate my ego or something like that.</v>

86
00:02:43.701 --> 00:02:44.534
<v Speaker 1>Huh.</v>

87
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

88
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.620
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the things I have noticed is that I might be little less patient</v>

89
00:02:48.621 --> 00:02:50.060
<v Speaker 1>with people when I'm speaking,</v>

90
00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.283
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

91
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.100
<v Speaker 1>because I'm more used to that,</v>

92
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.460
<v Speaker 1>more use to that might be good for me to be listened to and so I have to watch</v>

93
00:02:58.461 --> 00:02:58.731
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

94
00:02:58.731 --> 00:02:59.380
<v Speaker 1>But I'm pretty,</v>

95
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.800
<v Speaker 1>I've always been pretty noisy and talkative and so that's probably something</v>

96
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:07.300
<v Speaker 1>that's plagued me or being a characteristic of me ever since I was a little tiny</v>

97
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.720
<v Speaker 1>kid.</v>

98
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.553
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

99
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.200
<v Speaker 1>I used to talk all the time when I was a little,</v>

100
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:12.400
<v Speaker 1>little,</v>

101
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.210
<v Speaker 1>little guy.</v>

102
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.541
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

103
00:03:13.541 --> 00:03:15.200
<v Speaker 1>I think my cousin Eric Pony,</v>

104
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.900
<v Speaker 1>he probably listens to this.</v>

105
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.240
<v Speaker 1>He used to call the motor mouth and that was the boat.</v>

106
00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:19.961
<v Speaker 1>Exactly right.</v>

107
00:03:19.961 --> 00:03:21.700
<v Speaker 1>I was like a miniature Camille Paglia.</v>

108
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.863
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

109
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:23.793
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

110
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.491
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>

111
00:03:24.491 --> 00:03:26.110
<v Speaker 1>I can't complain about having,</v>

112
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.711
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

113
00:03:26.711 --> 00:03:27.544
<v Speaker 1>fans I,</v>

114
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.500
<v Speaker 1>people have been unbelievably good to be,</v>

115
00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:31.690
<v Speaker 1>and I'm really grateful for that.</v>

116
00:03:31.691 --> 00:03:32.524
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

117
00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:33.030
<v Speaker 1>um.</v>
