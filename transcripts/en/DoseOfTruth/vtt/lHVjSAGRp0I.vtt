1
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:12.693
<v Speaker 1>It</v>

2
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.830
<v Speaker 1>frustrated by his success in the day,</v>

3
00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.760
<v Speaker 1>or at least the excuse she</v>

4
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:24.163
<v Speaker 1>jumped,</v>

5
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

6
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.820
<v Speaker 1>It's not a casual,</v>

7
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.010
<v Speaker 1>aggressive,</v>

8
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.791
<v Speaker 1>impulsive.</v>

9
00:00:33.791 --> 00:00:38.791
<v Speaker 1>When twist your hand is in your hands because it wrangler and you see crowd</v>

10
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:40.181
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

11
00:00:40.181 --> 00:00:41.260
<v Speaker 1>it's not bad.</v>

12
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:42.511
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

13
00:00:42.511 --> 00:00:43.344
<v Speaker 1>very deliberate.</v>

14
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.170
<v Speaker 1>And to hit people one continuous sequence like that.</v>

15
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.980
<v Speaker 1>And then I talked to a journalist who had seen his hand the next day he was</v>

16
00:00:53.981 --> 00:00:54.940
<v Speaker 1>raised in court.</v>

17
00:00:54.941 --> 00:00:58.960
<v Speaker 1>She said that he walked into the courtroom like someone who's near Fort Ward.</v>

18
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:00.670
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

19
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.670
<v Speaker 1>so there's this constellation of action.</v>

20
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.240
<v Speaker 1>I think the only proper way to describe those options as evil action.</v>

21
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.870
<v Speaker 1>That is in some sense,</v>

22
00:01:16.871 --> 00:01:21.871
<v Speaker 1>because you described the options as equal as to also simultaneously proclaim</v>

23
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.540
<v Speaker 1>the reality of good and evil in the world.</v>

24
00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.450
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't really bother me because I can't see that presenting</v>

25
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.190
<v Speaker 1>alternative language.</v>

26
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.090
<v Speaker 1>It's useful to describe.</v>

27
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.590
<v Speaker 1>You might not agree with that</v>

28
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.911
<v Speaker 1>you might want to make,</v>

29
00:01:42.911 --> 00:01:46.980
<v Speaker 1>but that's the appropriate language within which to close such event.</v>

30
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.320
<v Speaker 1>I need to be appropriate language.</v>

31
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.400
<v Speaker 1>And that means that in order to understand that you have to speak a language of</v>

32
00:01:54.401 --> 00:01:55.210
<v Speaker 1>good and evil,</v>

33
00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.940
<v Speaker 1>and I do believe this to be true.</v>

34
00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.730
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you why in part one of the things that's happened to me,</v>

35
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.940
<v Speaker 1>I didn't lecture online a distinction between tried to do an eval and I think</v>

36
00:02:07.121 --> 00:02:12.121
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the most effective but direct delivered are starting to say brigade</v>

37
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.640
<v Speaker 1>out conceptually earthquakes and cancer,</v>

38
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.100
<v Speaker 1>you know standard catastrophes of life.</v>

39
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.660
<v Speaker 1>The perpetrator acts of God will speak very hard on the people obviously and how</v>

40
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.920
<v Speaker 1>often did Jay from the level of tax which are getting in the same manner and you</v>

41
00:02:30.791 --> 00:02:32.530
<v Speaker 1>might think therefore the same,</v>

42
00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.420
<v Speaker 1>they're not the same thing.</v>

43
00:02:34.421 --> 00:02:35.820
<v Speaker 1>They're tragic use.</v>

44
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.240
<v Speaker 1>One thing and the level of this is another thing and the level of tragedies,</v>

45
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.120
<v Speaker 1>the worst things that we actually don't this as clinicians if we're awake like</v>

46
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.480
<v Speaker 1>all of those because one of the things that it's well documented in the clinical</v>

47
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.510
<v Speaker 1>literature is what causes post traumatic stress disorder.</v>

48
00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.480
<v Speaker 1>Generally speaking,</v>

49
00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.540
<v Speaker 1>it isn't exposure to tragedy opposed to disorder can usually what causes post</v>

50
00:03:02.731 --> 00:03:04.540
<v Speaker 1>traumatic stress is exposure.</v>

51
00:03:04.541 --> 00:03:05.374
<v Speaker 1>To my level.</v>

52
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.830
<v Speaker 1>So not only can you have to be hurt or do you have to be hurt by someone who is</v>

53
00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:12.640
<v Speaker 1>intended for food.</v>

54
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:14.290
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm very,</v>

55
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.790
<v Speaker 1>the other variants of this often happens to soldiers.</v>

56
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.520
<v Speaker 1>They go into battle and they observe themselves something that's deeply 11th,</v>

57
00:03:21.521 --> 00:03:22.490
<v Speaker 1>and they never knew that.</v>

58
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.100
<v Speaker 1>They had to ask him for that.</v>

59
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.200
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps just part of them that even enjoys it,</v>

60
00:03:26.201 --> 00:03:27.550
<v Speaker 1>at least in the vulnerable thing.</v>

61
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.600
<v Speaker 1>And afterwards they're fragmented by the consequences.</v>

62
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.820
<v Speaker 1>Say people who were perhaps somewhat too naive,</v>

63
00:03:34.821 --> 00:03:36.370
<v Speaker 1>he can make effective soldiers.</v>

64
00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:37.603
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

65
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.900
<v Speaker 1>they observe themselves doing something terrible on the battlefield and then</v>

66
00:03:40.901 --> 00:03:43.420
<v Speaker 1>they're broken and they cannot be prepared.</v>

67
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:44.460
<v Speaker 1>And I've had many heart,</v>

68
00:03:44.461 --> 00:03:46.060
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult for them to be repaired.</v>

69
00:03:46.061 --> 00:03:50.860
<v Speaker 1>And I've had many people like that contact me and say that because they've</v>

70
00:03:50.861 --> 00:03:52.930
<v Speaker 1>watched the select trouble,</v>

71
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.210
<v Speaker 1>the distinction between tragedy and evil,</v>

72
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.370
<v Speaker 1>they have been able to recover,</v>

73
00:03:57.371 --> 00:03:59.770
<v Speaker 1>at least in part from the post traumatic stress disorder.</v>

74
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.460
<v Speaker 1>And so in my own clinical practice when I treated people,</v>

75
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.550
<v Speaker 1>I had a client who was a young woman and she had been bullied very badly by a</v>

76
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.170
<v Speaker 1>boy who she did not want to go up with it.</v>

77
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.310
<v Speaker 1>After that made it his life's work to bring her down.</v>

78
00:04:15.311 --> 00:04:19.360
<v Speaker 1>When she did very effectively is friends and they pulled her into a state of</v>

79
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.070
<v Speaker 1>absolute psychosis.</v>

80
00:04:21.071 --> 00:04:22.000
<v Speaker 1>When I first saw her,</v>

81
00:04:22.001 --> 00:04:25.180
<v Speaker 1>she couldn't even speak and she was hallucinating.</v>

82
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.600
<v Speaker 1>She had arbitrary and visual hallucinations and I could barely communicate with</v>

83
00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:29.434
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>

84
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.560
<v Speaker 1>I spent about eight months with her slowly detailing out what happened and what</v>

85
00:04:36.291 --> 00:04:40.570
<v Speaker 1>could really affected her was the fact that she couldn't understand how anyone</v>

86
00:04:40.571 --> 00:04:43.870
<v Speaker 1>can be so cruel as to bloat with the way to do nothing but make her life</v>

87
00:04:43.871 --> 00:04:46.720
<v Speaker 1>miserable and that's what broke her and she was real.</v>

88
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.130
<v Speaker 1>It was really serious and we had to sit and talk.</v>

89
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.731
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

90
00:04:51.731 --> 00:04:55.930
<v Speaker 1>I tried to carry weight and then as she recovered in increasingly coherent ways</v>

91
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.000
<v Speaker 1>about good and evil,</v>

92
00:04:58.001 --> 00:05:02.350
<v Speaker 1>essentially about the fact that people can be motivated to pursue nothing.</v>

93
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.370
<v Speaker 1>That disruption and pain and misery and to do that consciously and within 10</v>

94
00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.840
<v Speaker 1>accidentally and assets as the victims of some of the process,</v>

95
00:05:13.841 --> 00:05:14.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

96
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:15.010
<v Speaker 1>but fuck,</v>

97
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.400
<v Speaker 1>knowing full well what they're doing it and doing it because they know what</v>

98
00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:19.234
<v Speaker 1>they're doing.</v>

99
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.270
<v Speaker 1>And she was a lot more mature,</v>

100
00:05:22.271 --> 00:05:25.530
<v Speaker 1>let's say at the end of that process that she was at the beginning,</v>

101
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.780
<v Speaker 1>uncle,</v>

102
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.190
<v Speaker 1>she paid great crisis Chrysler for politics,</v>

103
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.190
<v Speaker 1>which is typically the case.</v>

104
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.100
<v Speaker 1>So I do understand that.</v>

105
00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.880
<v Speaker 1>I do understand what sort of language is necessary for use to frame these sorts</v>

106
00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:40.720
<v Speaker 1>of situations.</v>

107
00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.130
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

108
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.590
<v Speaker 1>and I think the language of good and evil is the appropriate language.</v>

109
00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.830
<v Speaker 1>You aren't treating the topic we sufficient seriousness unless you need the</v>

110
00:05:52.451 --> 00:05:54.970
<v Speaker 1>appropriate terminology and evil.</v>

111
00:05:54.971 --> 00:05:55.301
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>

112
00:05:55.301 --> 00:05:59.690
<v Speaker 1>it's something like the generation of harm for the sake of the harm.</v>

113
00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.650
<v Speaker 1>It's best to think about it as a continent,</v>

114
00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:02.520
<v Speaker 1>this fed.</v>

115
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.130
<v Speaker 1>And you can understand that if you think about the assignment of mentioned work</v>

116
00:06:06.131 --> 00:06:07.060
<v Speaker 1>will set you free.</v>

117
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.033
<v Speaker 1>There's in this</v>

118
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.090
<v Speaker 1>dramatic or artistic statement painted block essentially.</v>

119
00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.380
<v Speaker 1>And people don't like that idea because we don't like definitely,</v>

120
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:18.741
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

121
00:06:18.741 --> 00:06:20.780
<v Speaker 1>we like to think that the only cause of human</v>

122
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:26.750
<v Speaker 1>inappropriate human action is increments.</v>

123
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:28.490
<v Speaker 1>Like people just do better.</v>

124
00:06:28.491 --> 00:06:29.131
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't do it.</v>

125
00:06:29.131 --> 00:06:30.940
<v Speaker 1>And it's like I'm afraid that just doesn't cut it.</v>

126
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.520
<v Speaker 1>People know perfectly well what they're doing and that's exactly why they're</v>

127
00:06:34.521 --> 00:06:35.354
<v Speaker 1>doing it.</v>

128
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:36.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

129
00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.120
<v Speaker 1>there's increments evolve.</v>

130
00:06:37.121 --> 00:06:38.920
<v Speaker 1>What does eight parents involved in everything and it's,</v>

131
00:06:38.921 --> 00:06:40.490
<v Speaker 1>it's not sufficient explanation.</v>
