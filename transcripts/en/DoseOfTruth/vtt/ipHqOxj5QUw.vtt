00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.920
<v Speaker 1>Do you have investigated brain activity during motor imagery in stroke patients</v>

2
00:00:11.921 --> 00:00:14.290
<v Speaker 1>with hemiparesis and be paresis his,</v>

3
00:00:14.291 --> 00:00:14.680
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

4
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.330
<v Speaker 1>motor impairment from,</v>

6
00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:17.643
<v Speaker 1>from uh,</v>

7
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:18.970
<v Speaker 1>from the stroke.</v>

8
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.840
<v Speaker 1>This work is exact aimed at examining similarities between motor imagery and</v>

9
00:00:22.841 --> 00:00:23.674
<v Speaker 1>execution.</v>

10
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.060
<v Speaker 1>In a group of stroke patients,</v>

11
00:00:25.061 --> 00:00:29.350
<v Speaker 1>11 patients were asked to perform a visual motor tracking task by either</v>

12
00:00:29.351 --> 00:00:33.310
<v Speaker 1>physically or mentally tracking a sine wave forest target using their thumb and</v>

13
00:00:33.311 --> 00:00:34.144
<v Speaker 1>index finger.</v>

14
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.103
<v Speaker 1>So they're doing this</v>

15
00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.760
<v Speaker 1>during FMRI scanning results.</v>

16
00:00:39.761 --> 00:00:44.761
<v Speaker 1>Whole brain analysis confirmed shared neural substrates between motor imagery</v>

17
00:00:44.801 --> 00:00:47.410
<v Speaker 1>and motor execution and bilateral premotor cortex.</v>

18
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.750
<v Speaker 1>So that's the part that I was talking about.</v>

19
00:00:49.751 --> 00:00:52.510
<v Speaker 1>I won't tell you about the rest of the brain in pride.</v>

20
00:00:52.511 --> 00:00:53.021
<v Speaker 1>A lobule.</v>

21
00:00:53.021 --> 00:00:55.540
<v Speaker 1>This is partly associated with body recognition.</v>

22
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:01.240
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

23
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.870
<v Speaker 1>so basically I showed you that study because it,</v>

24
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.360
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

25
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.870
<v Speaker 1>it's one,</v>

26
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.020
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the studies that lend credence to what I was just describing is that</v>

27
00:01:08.021 --> 00:01:11.350
<v Speaker 1>imagery is the precursor to action and that it's associated.</v>

28
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.530
<v Speaker 1>You get the imagery going here and the action there.</v>

29
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:15.670
<v Speaker 1>Think about,</v>

30
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.800
<v Speaker 1>think about thanking think,</v>

31
00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:18.693
<v Speaker 1>act.</v>

32
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.020
<v Speaker 1>That's roughly how it works.</v>

33
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.791
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

34
00:01:23.791 --> 00:01:24.624
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

35
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.280
<v Speaker 1>now down to cognitive ability.</v>

36
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.473
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

37
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.330
<v Speaker 1>how can you conceptualize intelligence?</v>

38
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.533
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

39
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.820
<v Speaker 1>well this is a major problem because your initial conceptualization determines</v>

40
00:01:37.821 --> 00:01:42.680
<v Speaker 1>in part the strategies that you're going to use to investigate intelligence.</v>

41
00:01:42.681 --> 00:01:43.970
<v Speaker 1>And when you say,</v>

42
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.481
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

43
00:01:44.481 --> 00:01:47.630
<v Speaker 1>when you pair a sentence down to what is intelligence,</v>

44
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.040
<v Speaker 1>the sentence is problematic because part of it is a question about</v>

45
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.050
<v Speaker 1>if and how such a thing might manifest itself in the world.</v>

46
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.970
<v Speaker 1>So there's a fact out there that are set of facts that corresponds to</v>

47
00:02:01.971 --> 00:02:02.511
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>

48
00:02:02.511 --> 00:02:03.350
<v Speaker 1>But the other problem is,</v>

49
00:02:03.351 --> 00:02:06.170
<v Speaker 1>well what do you mean when you say intelligence?</v>

50
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.240
<v Speaker 1>And you kind of have to nail that down.</v>

51
00:02:08.241 --> 00:02:11.750
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to have a coke conversation about intelligence,</v>

52
00:02:11.751 --> 00:02:13.430
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't go entirely astray.</v>

53
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:14.611
<v Speaker 1>And so you've got a,</v>

54
00:02:14.611 --> 00:02:17.630
<v Speaker 1>you've got a definitional problem as well as an empirical problem.</v>

55
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.913
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

56
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.110
<v Speaker 1>there have been,</v>

57
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.180
<v Speaker 1>and this was especially true in the 1990s</v>

58
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.930
<v Speaker 1>people have been studying intelligence Iq intelligence since the 1920s and it is</v>

59
00:02:30.151 --> 00:02:32.400
<v Speaker 1>a very well established branch of psychology.</v>

60
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.470
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I have to tell you about it,</v>

61
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.450
<v Speaker 1>Iq research is that if you don't buy Iq research,</v>

62
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.210
<v Speaker 1>you might as well throw away all the rest of psychology.</v>

63
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.290
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that the psychologists,</v>

64
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.831
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

65
00:02:46.831 --> 00:02:50.670
<v Speaker 1>who developed intelligence testing were among the early psychologists who</v>

66
00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:55.671
<v Speaker 1>instantiated the statistical techniques that all psychologists use to verify and</v>

67
00:02:55.801 --> 00:02:57.570
<v Speaker 1>test all of their hypotheses.</v>

68
00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.500
<v Speaker 1>So you end up throwing the baby out with the bath water and the Iq people have</v>

69
00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:05.860
<v Speaker 1>defined intelligence in a more stringent,</v>

70
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.890
<v Speaker 1>stringent and accurate way than we've been able to define almost any other</v>

71
00:03:10.931 --> 00:03:12.520
<v Speaker 1>psychological construct.</v>

72
00:03:12.521 --> 00:03:15.640
<v Speaker 1>And so if you toss out the one that's most well defined,</v>

73
00:03:15.641 --> 00:03:18.100
<v Speaker 1>then you're kind of stuck with the problem of what are you going to do with all</v>

74
00:03:18.101 --> 00:03:22.120
<v Speaker 1>the ones that you have leftover that are nowhere near as well defined or as well</v>

75
00:03:22.121 --> 00:03:23.470
<v Speaker 1>measured or as,</v>

76
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.240
<v Speaker 1>or as or,</v>

77
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.860
<v Speaker 1>or who's predictive validity is much less than it has been demonstrated with</v>

78
00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:32.920
<v Speaker 1>much less vigor and clarity anyways,</v>

79
00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:37.480
<v Speaker 1>despite all that people have posited a number of different intelligences and</v>

80
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.800
<v Speaker 1>reasonably so because there's a,</v>

81
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.850
<v Speaker 1>if you think of intelligence as that which might move you forward successfully</v>

82
00:03:45.401 --> 00:03:46.234
<v Speaker 1>in the world,</v>

83
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.020
<v Speaker 1>obviously there's a fair number of phenomena that are associated with</v>

84
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:52.000
<v Speaker 1>individuals that might fit into that category.</v>

85
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.833
<v Speaker 1>So we have</v>

86
00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.060
<v Speaker 1>people have made these distinctions.</v>

87
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:02.710
<v Speaker 1>Bob Sternberg for example,</v>

88
00:04:02.711 --> 00:04:07.210
<v Speaker 1>is distinguished between practical versus analytical intelligence and he kind of</v>

89
00:04:07.211 --> 00:04:11.860
<v Speaker 1>thinks of practical as like street smarts and has attempted to dissociate that</v>

90
00:04:11.861 --> 00:04:15.250
<v Speaker 1>from the kind of analytical intelligence that um,</v>

91
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.040
<v Speaker 1>that characterize this more straight Iq research.</v>

92
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's done it successfully as well at all.</v>

93
00:04:20.591 --> 00:04:25.591
<v Speaker 1>And since the 1990s interest in his practical intelligence has declined</v>

94
00:04:25.691 --> 00:04:30.691
<v Speaker 1>precipitously because when it is matched head to head with standard Iq</v>

95
00:04:30.761 --> 00:04:31.594
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>

96
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.420
<v Speaker 1>the IQ intelligence seats up pull the variability.</v>

97
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.260
<v Speaker 1>What's really happened as far as I can tell so far is that when we're trying to</v>

98
00:04:38.261 --> 00:04:40.960
<v Speaker 1>predict people's course through life,</v>

99
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.850
<v Speaker 1>Iq does a very good job and then one of the traits does a very good job as well,</v>

100
00:04:45.851 --> 00:04:47.800
<v Speaker 1>which is conscientiousness,</v>

101
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.770
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't do as good a job as Iq.</v>

102
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.280
<v Speaker 1>Now that partly might be because we can't measure conscientiousness very well.</v>

103
00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.320
<v Speaker 1>We're stuck with self reports or maybe I could gather peer reports about you or</v>

104
00:05:00.321 --> 00:05:04.220
<v Speaker 1>I could gather your parents reports about your teachers reports and each of</v>

105
00:05:04.221 --> 00:05:08.900
<v Speaker 1>those seems to pick up a little bit more of the pattern because you know</v>

106
00:05:08.901 --> 00:05:09.441
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

107
00:05:09.441 --> 00:05:12.980
<v Speaker 1>but other people know you differently than you know yourself and there's still</v>

108
00:05:12.981 --> 00:05:14.000
<v Speaker 1>some accuracy in that.</v>

109
00:05:14.001 --> 00:05:18.110
<v Speaker 1>You can get multiple rater reports of something like conscientiousness and</v>

110
00:05:18.111 --> 00:05:18.621
<v Speaker 1>that'll up.</v>

111
00:05:18.621 --> 00:05:19.760
<v Speaker 1>It's predictive validity.</v>

112
00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.410
<v Speaker 1>But in the final analysis,</v>

113
00:05:21.411 --> 00:05:24.710
<v Speaker 1>the best you seem to be able to deal with conscientiousness is about a 0.4</v>

114
00:05:24.711 --> 00:05:26.900
<v Speaker 1>correlation with longterm performance.</v>

115
00:05:26.901 --> 00:05:29.120
<v Speaker 1>Whereas with Iq in complex jobs,</v>

116
00:05:29.121 --> 00:05:34.121
<v Speaker 1>you can probably get 0.5 and maybe 0.6 and so 0.5 is 25% of the variance.</v>

117
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.840
<v Speaker 1>You've got to square it.</v>

118
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:41.050
<v Speaker 1>Point six is 30% 36% of the variance and 0.4 is 16% of the variance.</v>

119
00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:43.490
<v Speaker 1>So even at the low end,</v>

120
00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.970
<v Speaker 1>let's say high end for conscientiousness is 0.4 or 16% low end for Iq is 0.5 or</v>

121
00:05:50.601 --> 00:05:52.160
<v Speaker 1>25% low.</v>

122
00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.210
<v Speaker 1>And estimates of Iq make it one and a half times more powerful than the high end</v>

123
00:05:56.211 --> 00:05:57.044
<v Speaker 1>estimates of.</v>

124
00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.330
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's about right.</v>

125
00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.931
<v Speaker 1>You'd think,</v>

126
00:05:59.931 --> 00:06:01.610
<v Speaker 1>why do we even have to debate this?</v>

127
00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:05.240
<v Speaker 1>And because it's so bloody obvious to me that intelligence is a major predictor</v>

128
00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:06.080
<v Speaker 1>of life success.</v>

129
00:06:06.081 --> 00:06:07.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean you people,</v>

130
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.890
<v Speaker 1>I've measured the Iq of University of Toronto people,</v>

131
00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:10.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

132
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.240
<v Speaker 1>people in this room who have an Iq of less than 120 are rare.</v>

133
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.961
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

134
00:06:14.961 --> 00:06:15.794
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

135
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:16.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

136
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.200
<v Speaker 1>smart people go to university now.</v>

137
00:06:18.201 --> 00:06:20.720
<v Speaker 1>Is that actually a contentious statement?</v>

138
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.760
<v Speaker 1>What shouldn't be a contentious statement?</v>

139
00:06:22.761 --> 00:06:23.660
<v Speaker 1>It's self evident.</v>

140
00:06:23.661 --> 00:06:27.350
<v Speaker 1>Universities were actually set up so that smart people could expand their</v>

141
00:06:27.351 --> 00:06:27.861
