1
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.570
<v Speaker 1>They jumped her Catalan,</v>

2
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:07.981
<v Speaker 1>their goods,</v>

3
00:00:07.981 --> 00:00:10.620
<v Speaker 1>which they had gotten in the land of Canaan and came into Egypt,</v>

4
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.250
<v Speaker 1>Jacob and all his seed with them.</v>

5
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.310
<v Speaker 1>And he sent Judah before month Joseph to direct his face under gosh.</v>

6
00:00:19.311 --> 00:00:19.431
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

7
00:00:19.431 --> 00:00:23.360
<v Speaker 1>and they came into the land of Goshen and Joseph Made ready his chariot and went</v>

8
00:00:23.361 --> 00:00:24.111
<v Speaker 1>to meet Israel,</v>

9
00:00:24.111 --> 00:00:24.944
<v Speaker 1>his father,</v>

10
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.940
<v Speaker 1>and presented himself to them and fell on his neck and wept on his neck a good</v>

11
00:00:28.941 --> 00:00:29.774
<v Speaker 1>while.</v>

12
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:30.830
<v Speaker 1>And Israel said,</v>

13
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.480
<v Speaker 1>I can now die because I've seen your face because you're still alive.</v>

14
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.590
<v Speaker 1>And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph saying that father and thy brethren are coming to</v>

15
00:00:42.591 --> 00:00:42.881
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

16
00:00:42.881 --> 00:00:45.710
<v Speaker 1>and the land of Egypt is before the and the best of the land.</v>

17
00:00:45.711 --> 00:00:49.220
<v Speaker 1>Your father and brothers can dwell in the land of Gosh and let them dwell.</v>

18
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.310
<v Speaker 1>And if they're now no any men of activity among them,</v>

19
00:00:52.311 --> 00:00:53.990
<v Speaker 1>then make them rulers over my cattle.</v>

20
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.063
<v Speaker 1>It gives them a job.</v>

21
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.870
<v Speaker 1>And Joseph brought in Jacob,</v>

22
00:00:56.871 --> 00:00:57.704
<v Speaker 1>his father and said,</v>

23
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.470
<v Speaker 1>and before Pharaoh and Jacob Blessed Pharaoh.</v>

24
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.550
<v Speaker 1>That's a very interesting little turn of events because you'd expect the</v>

25
00:01:04.551 --> 00:01:06.470
<v Speaker 1>opposite under those circumstances.</v>

26
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.843
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

27
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.590
<v Speaker 1>it appears that Jacob was a man of relatively great self possession.</v>

28
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.873
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's not an,</v>

29
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.150
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't bless Queen Elizabeth in all likelihood as you had a lot of gall.</v>

30
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.440
<v Speaker 1>And Pharaoh said unto Jacob,</v>

31
00:01:22.441 --> 00:01:23.041
<v Speaker 1>how old are you?</v>

32
00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:23.880
<v Speaker 1>And Jacob said,</v>

33
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm 130 years,</v>

34
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.000
<v Speaker 1>few and evil have been the days of the years of my life and I've not attained</v>

35
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:31.440
<v Speaker 1>unto the days of the years of my,</v>

36
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.010
<v Speaker 1>of my,</v>

37
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.800
<v Speaker 1>of the life of my fathers and the days of their pilgrimage.</v>

38
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.240
<v Speaker 1>And Jacob Blessed Pharaoh and went out from before Pharaoh and Israel dwelt in</v>

39
00:01:39.241 --> 00:01:40.080
<v Speaker 1>the land of Egypt,</v>

40
00:01:40.081 --> 00:01:41.020
<v Speaker 1>in the country of Gosh,</v>

41
00:01:41.021 --> 00:01:41.151
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

42
00:01:41.151 --> 00:01:44.130
<v Speaker 1>and grew and multiplied exceedingly.</v>

43
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.960
<v Speaker 1>And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt,</v>

44
00:01:45.961 --> 00:01:46.920
<v Speaker 1>17 years.</v>

45
00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.620
<v Speaker 1>So the whole age of Jacob was 147 years.</v>

46
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.090
<v Speaker 1>And the time drew nigh that Israel must die.</v>

47
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.931
<v Speaker 1>And he called his son.</v>

48
00:01:54.931 --> 00:01:56.100
<v Speaker 1>Joseph had said unto him,</v>

49
00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.520
<v Speaker 1>if I have now found grace in thy sight,</v>

50
00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:00.131
<v Speaker 1>put,</v>

51
00:02:00.131 --> 00:02:04.360
<v Speaker 1>I pray thee thy hand under my thigh and deal kindly and truly with me,</v>

52
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.871
<v Speaker 1>bury me.</v>

53
00:02:04.871 --> 00:02:05.170
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>

54
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.430
<v Speaker 1>I pray thee in Egypt,</v>

55
00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.720
<v Speaker 1>but I will lie with my fathers now shall carry me out of Egypt and burry me and</v>

56
00:02:11.721 --> 00:02:12.830
<v Speaker 1>they're burying place.</v>

57
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.931
<v Speaker 1>And Joseph said,</v>

58
00:02:14.931 --> 00:02:16.340
<v Speaker 1>I will do as you've said.</v>

59
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.330
<v Speaker 1>And it came to pass after these things that one told Joseph,</v>

60
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.830
<v Speaker 1>behold I father is sick.</v>

61
00:02:22.831 --> 00:02:24.180
<v Speaker 1>And he took with him his two sons,</v>

62
00:02:24.181 --> 00:02:27.240
<v Speaker 1>Madison FM and one told Jacob and said,</v>

63
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.410
<v Speaker 1>behold thy son.</v>

64
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.330
<v Speaker 1>And one told Jacob and said,</v>

65
00:02:30.331 --> 00:02:31.141
<v Speaker 1>behold thy son,</v>

66
00:02:31.141 --> 00:02:35.280
<v Speaker 1>Joseph Cometh unto Thee and Israel strength in himself and sat upon the bed.</v>

67
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.860
<v Speaker 1>And Israel said unto Joseph,</v>

68
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.890
<v Speaker 1>I had not thought to see your face and low God has also showed me your children.</v>

69
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.850
<v Speaker 1>And Joseph brought them out from between his knees and out himself with his face</v>

70
00:02:47.851 --> 00:02:48.361
<v Speaker 1>to the earth.</v>

71
00:02:48.361 --> 00:02:51.750
<v Speaker 1>And Joseph took them both and for him in his right hand towards Israel's</v>

72
00:02:51.751 --> 00:02:52.870
<v Speaker 1>lefthand and Madison,</v>

73
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.770
<v Speaker 1>his lefthand toward Israel's right hand and brought them near unto him.</v>

74
00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>And Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it upon firms head who was the</v>

75
00:03:00.071 --> 00:03:05.071
<v Speaker 1>younger and his left hand upon Madison's head guiding his hands purposefully for</v>

76
00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:06.610
<v Speaker 1>Madison was the first board.</v>

77
00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:10.110
<v Speaker 1>And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of the frame</v>

78
00:03:10.111 --> 00:03:14.150
<v Speaker 1>and displeased him and he held up as far as hand to remove it from informs head</v>

79
00:03:14.151 --> 00:03:15.490
<v Speaker 1>onto [inaudible] head.</v>

80
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.490
<v Speaker 1>And Joseph said unto his father,</v>

81
00:03:18.491 --> 00:03:18.761
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

82
00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:19.001
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>

83
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:23.470
<v Speaker 1>So my father for this is the first board put the right hand upon his head head</v>

84
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.030
<v Speaker 1>and his father refused and said,</v>

85
00:03:25.031 --> 00:03:25.841
<v Speaker 1>I know what my son,</v>

86
00:03:25.841 --> 00:03:26.674
<v Speaker 1>I know it.</v>

87
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.860
<v Speaker 1>He shall also become a people and he shall also be great,</v>

88
00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:33.850
<v Speaker 1>but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he and his seed shall become</v>

89
00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:35.050
<v Speaker 1>a multitude of nations.</v>

90
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.560
<v Speaker 1>Another repeat of the same thing that happens continually.</v>

91
00:03:38.561 --> 00:03:39.394
<v Speaker 1>It's is when,</v>

92
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.460
<v Speaker 1>when God wants to intervene in human affairs,</v>

93
00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:44.050
<v Speaker 1>what he does is invert tradition.</v>

94
00:03:44.051 --> 00:03:45.130
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

95
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.660
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a sign that that there's something new and special going on and</v>

96
00:03:49.661 --> 00:03:52.720
<v Speaker 1>that gives precedents to the younger child rather than the older child</v>

97
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.810
<v Speaker 1>precedents to what is new rather than what's traditional.</v>

98
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.351
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

99
00:03:56.351 --> 00:04:00.760
<v Speaker 1>sometimes that's necessary because tradition is insufficient and sometimes</v>

100
00:04:00.761 --> 00:04:03.370
<v Speaker 1>something new has to come into being in order to update it.</v>

101
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.400
<v Speaker 1>And Jacob called together his sons and said,</v>

102
00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:10.870
<v Speaker 1>gathered together so that I can tell you that which shall be follow you in the</v>

103
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:11.703
<v Speaker 1>last days.</v>

104
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.430
<v Speaker 1>Gather yourself together and here you sons of Jacob and hearken unto Israel,</v>

105
00:04:15.431 --> 00:04:16.264
<v Speaker 1>your father,</v>

106
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:17.530
<v Speaker 1>Ruben.</v>

107
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to go through all 12 of these Reuben,</v>

108
00:04:19.901 --> 00:04:20.261
<v Speaker 1>thou art,</v>

109
00:04:20.261 --> 00:04:21.070
<v Speaker 1>my firstborn,</v>

110
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.611
<v Speaker 1>my might,</v>

111
00:04:21.611 --> 00:04:23.020
<v Speaker 1>and the beginning of my strength,</v>

112
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.140
<v Speaker 1>the Excellency of Dignity and the Excellency of power.</v>

113
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:27.693
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>

114
00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.050
<v Speaker 1>the story's quite interesting here because Jacob Blesses Joseph's sons before he</v>

115
00:04:35.321 --> 00:04:36.610
<v Speaker 1>blesses it's old science.</v>

116
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:42.390
<v Speaker 1>And so what he's doing is placing the rights of the first born into the sons of</v>

117
00:04:43.841 --> 00:04:44.980
<v Speaker 1>his favorite son,</v>

118
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.780
<v Speaker 1>and then he goes to his sons.</v>

119
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.850
<v Speaker 1>And so that has implications for the way the biblical stories laid themselves</v>

120
00:04:51.851 --> 00:04:53.560
<v Speaker 1>out from thence forward</v>

121
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.240
<v Speaker 1>the excellence of dignity in the Excellency of power,</v>

122
00:04:58.241 --> 00:04:59.230
<v Speaker 1>unstable as water.</v>

123
00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:02.920
<v Speaker 1>Thou shalt not excel because that went up to thy father's bed,</v>

124
00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:03.820
<v Speaker 1>then defiled it.</v>

125
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:05.170
<v Speaker 1>He went up to my couch.</v>

126
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.200
<v Speaker 1>You may remember that Ruben slept with his fathers,</v>

127
00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:09.040
<v Speaker 1>cucumber,</v>

128
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.873
<v Speaker 1>concubine,</v>

129
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.240
<v Speaker 1>Simeon and Levi are brethren.</v>

130
00:05:13.241 --> 00:05:15.910
<v Speaker 1>Instruments of cruelty are in their habitations.</v>

131
00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:17.620
<v Speaker 1>That painting there.</v>

132
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:24.450
<v Speaker 1>What happened with Simeon and Levi was that somebody lay with their sister Dinah</v>

133
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:33.060
<v Speaker 1>and then offered to marry her and then had and then he came circumcised because</v>

134
00:05:33.671 --> 00:05:36.760
<v Speaker 1>that was part of the deal and then how to older men circumcised and then Simeon</v>

135
00:05:36.761 --> 00:05:41.761
<v Speaker 1>and Levi went in when they were recovering and killed them all and then Jacob</v>

136
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.720
<v Speaker 1>and all his people had to leave because all that irritated their relatives.</v>

137
00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:48.123
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

138
00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.620
<v Speaker 1>see me,</v>

139
00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.390
<v Speaker 1>Simeon and Levi are brethren the instruments of cruelty or in their habitations.</v>

140
00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.090
<v Speaker 1>All my soul come out into their secret unto their assembly,</v>

141
00:05:59.091 --> 00:06:02.890
<v Speaker 1>mine on or be not thou United for in their anger they slew a man and in their</v>

142
00:06:02.891 --> 00:06:05.210
<v Speaker 1>self self will they dig down a wall,</v>

143
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.440
<v Speaker 1>curse be their anger.</v>

144
00:06:06.441 --> 00:06:08.690
<v Speaker 1>For it was fierce and their route for it was cruel.</v>

145
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.510
<v Speaker 1>I will divide them in Jacob and scattered them in Israel,</v>

146
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.221
<v Speaker 1>Judah,</v>

147
00:06:13.221 --> 00:06:13.820
<v Speaker 1>thou art.</v>

148
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.640
<v Speaker 1>He who my brother and shall praise I hand shall be in the neck of dynamics that</v>

149
00:06:17.641 --> 00:06:22.641
<v Speaker 1>I father's children shall bow down before the Judah is alliance welp from the</v>

150
00:06:23.361 --> 00:06:23.691
<v Speaker 1>prey.</v>

151
00:06:23.691 --> 00:06:25.280
<v Speaker 1>My son though art gone up,</v>

152
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:26.570
<v Speaker 1>he stooped down.</v>

153
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.200
<v Speaker 1>He couched as a lion and as an old lion who shall rose him up.</v>

154
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.080
<v Speaker 1>The sceptre shall not depart from Judah,</v>

155
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:37.490
<v Speaker 1>nor a law giver from between his feet until Shiloh camp and unto him shall the</v>

156
00:06:37.491 --> 00:06:38.780
<v Speaker 1>gathering of the people be.</v>

157
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.400
<v Speaker 1>Joseph is a fruitful bough,</v>

158
00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.060
<v Speaker 1>even a fruitful bough by a well whose branches run over the wall.</v>

159
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.420
<v Speaker 1>The archers have sorely grieved him and shot at him and hated him,</v>

160
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.800
<v Speaker 1>but his bow abode in strength and the arms of his hands were made strong by the</v>

161
00:06:54.801 --> 00:06:56.450
<v Speaker 1>hands of the mighty God of Jacob.</v>

162
00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.340
<v Speaker 1>For then since the shepherd,</v>

163
00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:59.780
<v Speaker 1>the stone of Israel,</v>

164
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.010
<v Speaker 1>even by the god of my father,</v>

165
00:07:04.011 --> 00:07:07.190
<v Speaker 1>who she'll help the and by the Almighty who shall bless thee with the blessings</v>

166
00:07:07.191 --> 00:07:11.300
<v Speaker 1>of heavens above blessings of the deep that Liat under blessings of the beasts,</v>

167
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:11.781
<v Speaker 1>breasts,</v>

168
00:07:11.781 --> 00:07:12.614
<v Speaker 1>and of the womb.</v>

169
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.760
<v Speaker 1>The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors</v>

170
00:07:16.761 --> 00:07:19.190
<v Speaker 1>unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills.</v>

171
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:23.360
<v Speaker 1>They shall be on the head of Joseph and on the crown of the head of him that was</v>

172
00:07:23.361 --> 00:07:27.740
<v Speaker 1>separate from his brother and all these are the 12 tribes of Israel,</v>

173
00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:29.511
<v Speaker 1>and this is it.</v>

174
00:07:29.511 --> 00:07:31.430
<v Speaker 1>That they're farther spake unto them and blessed them.</v>

175
00:07:31.431 --> 00:07:33.020
<v Speaker 1>Everyone according to his blessing,</v>

176
00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:34.070
<v Speaker 1>he blessed them.</v>
