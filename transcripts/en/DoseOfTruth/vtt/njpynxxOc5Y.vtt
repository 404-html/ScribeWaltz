1
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:10.020
<v Speaker 1>Thought I'd start by just letting you know why I was objecting specifically to</v>

2
00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:12.390
<v Speaker 1>build see 16.</v>

3
00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:13.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:18.020
<v Speaker 1>I made three videos in late September and uh,</v>

5
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.020
<v Speaker 1>one of them criticized [inaudible] 16 and one of them criticize the University</v>

6
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.871
<v Speaker 1>of Toronto Administrations,</v>

7
00:00:25.871 --> 00:00:30.871
<v Speaker 1>the human resources peoples decision to make so called anti unconscious anti</v>

8
00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:37.200
<v Speaker 1>bias training mandatory for their HR staff,</v>

9
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.200
<v Speaker 1>which I thought was and still think was reprehensible.</v>

10
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.353
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

11
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't even remember what the other one was about,</v>

12
00:00:47.431 --> 00:00:48.390
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't really matter.</v>

13
00:00:48.391 --> 00:00:49.000
<v Speaker 1>Those were,</v>

14
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.920
<v Speaker 1>that was the first one.</v>

15
00:00:49.921 --> 00:00:53.940
<v Speaker 1>The one on bill see 16 that caused most of the fewer surprisingly enough.</v>

16
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.870
<v Speaker 1>And I said I wouldn't use the made up.</v>

17
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.250
<v Speaker 1>What I consider neologisms that purport to describe the status,</v>

18
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.930
<v Speaker 1>the status of people whose sexual identity is ambiguous because that isn't how</v>

19
00:01:13.771 --> 00:01:14.311
<v Speaker 1>it looked to me.</v>

20
00:01:14.311 --> 00:01:19.311
<v Speaker 1>It looked to me like these words like z and Zurr and so forth were the</v>

21
00:01:20.041 --> 00:01:25.041
<v Speaker 1>linguistic vanguard of a intellectual movement that I would say detest is</v>

22
00:01:25.981 --> 00:01:26.960
<v Speaker 1>probably the right</v>

23
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.310
<v Speaker 1>description.</v>

24
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.310
<v Speaker 1>And that's this strange blend of postmodernism and Marxism that has emerged to</v>

25
00:01:36.271 --> 00:01:38.190
<v Speaker 1>occupy the bulk of the humanities.</v>

26
00:01:38.191 --> 00:01:40.030
<v Speaker 1>And a good chunk of the social sciences.</v>

27
00:01:40.031 --> 00:01:45.030
<v Speaker 1>And so that was the first thing is that I'm not using those words.</v>

28
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.740
<v Speaker 1>That was the first thing that was personal,</v>

29
00:01:46.741 --> 00:01:47.041
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

30
00:01:47.041 --> 00:01:50.760
<v Speaker 1>Is that that's not a form of linguistic game that I'm willing to play.</v>

31
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.280
<v Speaker 1>And I have my reasons for that.</v>

32
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.790
<v Speaker 1>The second was I regard the ledge.</v>

33
00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.820
<v Speaker 1>Any legislation that compels people to use a certain kind of language as a very</v>

34
00:02:02.551 --> 00:02:03.384
<v Speaker 1>dangerous,</v>

35
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.871
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

36
00:02:03.871 --> 00:02:05.970
<v Speaker 1>dangerous piece of legislation directly,</v>

37
00:02:05.971 --> 00:02:08.340
<v Speaker 1>but also a very dangerous precedent.</v>

38
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

39
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.190
<v Speaker 1>there are limits on free speech that are already reasonably well instantiated in</v>

40
00:02:14.191 --> 00:02:14.850
<v Speaker 1>the law.</v>

41
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.530
<v Speaker 1>You can't incite a crime,</v>

42
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.190
<v Speaker 1>you can't threaten someone bodily in a believable manner.</v>

43
00:02:20.191 --> 00:02:25.191
<v Speaker 1>You can't libel someone we already have reasonable restrictions on,</v>

44
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:28.710
<v Speaker 1>on what you can't say.</v>

45
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.180
<v Speaker 1>But we've never had legislation that required you to use a certain language</v>

46
00:02:33.181 --> 00:02:35.480
<v Speaker 1>except in certain commercial applications.</v>

47
00:02:35.481 --> 00:02:36.301
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

48
00:02:36.301 --> 00:02:37.290
<v Speaker 1>if you sell tobacco,</v>

49
00:02:37.291 --> 00:02:38.550
<v Speaker 1>you have to put a warning on it.</v>

50
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.240
<v Speaker 1>But the United States Supreme Court decided,</v>

51
00:02:42.241 --> 00:02:46.170
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was in the 1940s that similar attempts to compel speech,</v>

52
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

53
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.910
<v Speaker 1>on the part of individuals in noncommercial settings was unconstitutional.</v>

54
00:02:50.911 --> 00:02:51.310
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

55
00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.110
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

56
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.380
<v Speaker 1>I know that that doesn't have any direct bearing on Canadian law but certainly</v>

57
00:02:55.381 --> 00:02:56.310
<v Speaker 1>the principal does.</v>

58
00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.030
<v Speaker 1>And then I was also very see one of the problems with a piece of legislation,</v>

59
00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:02.591
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>

60
00:03:02.591 --> 00:03:06.670
<v Speaker 1>I suppose the problem with interpreting a text as the postmodernists would say,</v>

61
00:03:06.671 --> 00:03:09.370
<v Speaker 1>is that it's not easy to get the level of interpretation right?</v>

62
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.671
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

63
00:03:09.671 --> 00:03:11.410
<v Speaker 1>Cause if you're interpreting a text,</v>

64
00:03:11.411 --> 00:03:12.244
<v Speaker 1>you can look at them,</v>

65
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.760
<v Speaker 1>you can look at the letters that happens with biblical interpretation.</v>

66
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.770
<v Speaker 1>Very often you'd look at the individual words,</v>

67
00:03:17.771 --> 00:03:18.790
<v Speaker 1>you can look at the phrases,</v>

68
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.200
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get the sentences,</v>

69
00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:21.370
<v Speaker 1>you can look at the paragraphs,</v>

70
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.530
<v Speaker 1>you could look at the work as a whole.</v>

71
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.160
<v Speaker 1>And then you also have to look at the context within which the work is being</v>

72
00:03:27.161 --> 00:03:30.790
<v Speaker 1>interpreted in order to come up with an interpretation of anything that's</v>

73
00:03:30.791 --> 00:03:31.451
<v Speaker 1>complex.</v>

74
00:03:31.451 --> 00:03:33.310
<v Speaker 1>And so when you see a piece of legislation,</v>

75
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.940
<v Speaker 1>it isn't obvious what the legislation is actually intended to do despite what</v>

76
00:03:40.151 --> 00:03:41.290
<v Speaker 1>it's purported to do.</v>

77
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.950
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't obvious what level of analysis to pick when you're going to</v>

78
00:03:44.951 --> 00:03:45.701
<v Speaker 1>criticize it.</v>

79
00:03:45.701 --> 00:03:47.980
<v Speaker 1>And in some ways bill see 16,</v>

80
00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.240
<v Speaker 1>you could regard it as innocuous just as an extension of rights that have</v>

81
00:03:52.241 --> 00:03:53.980
<v Speaker 1>already been granted to certain,</v>

82
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.420
<v Speaker 1>let's say protected groups.</v>

83
00:03:55.421 --> 00:03:58.990
<v Speaker 1>Although I'm not so thrilled about the whole notion of ascribing rights to</v>

84
00:03:58.991 --> 00:04:00.010
<v Speaker 1>groups to begin with.</v>

85
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.630
<v Speaker 1>We're already far down that path.</v>

86
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:02.620
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

87
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.453
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

88
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:04.151
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

89
00:04:04.151 --> 00:04:06.600
<v Speaker 1>I've been accused of making a mountain out of a mole hill,</v>

90
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.230
<v Speaker 1>but happily enough,</v>

91
00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.640
<v Speaker 1>the University of Toronto,</v>

92
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:10.930
<v Speaker 1>after I made the videos,</v>

93
00:04:10.931 --> 00:04:15.931
<v Speaker 1>immediately produced two letters that were informed by their legal departments</v>

94
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:18.723
<v Speaker 1>wisdom,</v>

95
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:19.960
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

96
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:24.960
<v Speaker 1>stating that what I had done with the video was perhaps in conflict with the</v>

97
00:04:25.151 --> 00:04:27.340
<v Speaker 1>university ethical guidelines.</v>

98
00:04:27.341 --> 00:04:30.880
<v Speaker 1>If you forget the ones that had to do with freedom of expression and that they</v>

99
00:04:30.881 --> 00:04:31.450
<v Speaker 1>might,</v>

100
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.290
<v Speaker 1>that my actions and even in making the video might have violated that the</v>

101
00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:40.030
<v Speaker 1>tenants of the Ontario Human Rights Act as its or the at least as it's</v>

102
00:04:40.031 --> 00:04:42.080
<v Speaker 1>interpreted by the Ontario Human Rights Commission.</v>

103
00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:47.081
<v Speaker 1>And so that helped put to rest any suggestion that I was actually scaremongering</v>

104
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.000
<v Speaker 1>because as soon as I,</v>

105
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.640
<v Speaker 1>as soon as I made the videos,</v>

106
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.270
<v Speaker 1>the legal department at the UFT immediately validated my fears.</v>

107
00:04:55.271 --> 00:04:56.410
<v Speaker 1>And so that was a perverse,</v>

108
00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.210
<v Speaker 1>was a perverse effect of their,</v>

109
00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.530
<v Speaker 1>of the letters they sent to me.</v>

110
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.113
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

111
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:02.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

112
00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.640
<v Speaker 1>the other thing that I,</v>

113
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:08.600
<v Speaker 1>there was other elements of the legislation that I object to and objected to and</v>

114
00:05:08.601 --> 00:05:09.191
<v Speaker 1>still do.</v>

115
00:05:09.191 --> 00:05:14.191
<v Speaker 1>And if you read the policies within which the legislation will be interpreted as</v>

116
00:05:14.291 --> 00:05:15.310
<v Speaker 1>the federal justice,</v>

117
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:16.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

118
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.080
<v Speaker 1>website indicated that it would be interpreted in within the policies that the</v>

119
00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.210
<v Speaker 1>Ontario Human Rights Commission has already established.</v>

120
00:05:22.211 --> 00:05:25.960
<v Speaker 1>Of course there's close cross talk between Ontario and the federal government</v>

121
00:05:25.961 --> 00:05:27.700
<v Speaker 1>because the liberals are in power in both.</v>

122
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.510
<v Speaker 1>And the radical end of the liberal party's in power in both situations.</v>

123
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.200
<v Speaker 1>And know it turns out that it's illegal for like a year liable as an employer.</v>

124
00:05:38.141 --> 00:05:38.974
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

125
00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.670
<v Speaker 1>if any of your employees say anything that can be construed as harassment,</v>

126
00:05:43.671 --> 00:05:45.190
<v Speaker 1>say on the grounds of sexual,</v>

127
00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

128
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:46.763
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

129
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.220
<v Speaker 1>or gender identity,</v>

130
00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.870
<v Speaker 1>even if what they say has unintended consequences.</v>

131
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.420
<v Speaker 1>And even if you don't know that they said it.</v>

132
00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.630
<v Speaker 1>And so that kind of legislation I just think is just absolutely reprehensible.</v>

133
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.280
<v Speaker 1>And then because it's designed to cast the broadest possible net to catch the</v>

134
00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:05.091
<v Speaker 1>most fish,</v>

135
00:06:05.091 --> 00:06:06.290
<v Speaker 1>and it's clearly,</v>

136
00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

137
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:11.030
<v Speaker 1>being implemented by people who are not precisely pro employer,</v>

138
00:06:11.031 --> 00:06:12.110
<v Speaker 1>let's put it that way.</v>

139
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:17.360
<v Speaker 1>And then there's another little ugly secret hidden underneath the policies.</v>

140
00:06:17.361 --> 00:06:22.361
<v Speaker 1>And that's manifest most clearly in the form of what's come to be known as the</v>

141
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:23.031
<v Speaker 1>Gender Unicorn,</v>

142
00:06:23.031 --> 00:06:24.920
<v Speaker 1>which I would recommend that you look up,</v>

143
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:30.190
<v Speaker 1>which is an animated character designed to indoctrinate small children into the</v>

144
00:06:31.041 --> 00:06:32.940
<v Speaker 1>social constructionist worldview,</v>

145
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.310
<v Speaker 1>which claims that biological sex,</v>

146
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.360
<v Speaker 1>gender identity,</v>

147
00:06:38.361 --> 00:06:42.320
<v Speaker 1>gender expression and sexual proclivity very independently,</v>

148
00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.530
<v Speaker 1>which they most certainly do not now.</v>

149
00:06:45.531 --> 00:06:46.850
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I said in the video.</v>

150
00:06:46.851 --> 00:06:48.620
<v Speaker 1>That's partly why I've been accused of say,</v>

151
00:06:48.621 --> 00:06:49.730
<v Speaker 1>being a transphobic.</v>

152
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.600
<v Speaker 1>I also complained that the university was taking policy advice from,</v>

153
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:54.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

154
00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:56.750
<v Speaker 1>the people who started black lives matter.</v>

155
00:06:56.751 --> 00:06:59.540
<v Speaker 1>And I don't have anything against black lives matter particularly,</v>

156
00:06:59.541 --> 00:07:01.310
<v Speaker 1>but the two people who started it are,</v>

157
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:02.030
<v Speaker 1>are not,</v>

158
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:02.863
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

159
00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:03.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

160
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.620
<v Speaker 1>the sorts of individuals let's say that the university should be basing its</v>

161
00:07:06.621 --> 00:07:08.180
<v Speaker 1>policy decisions,</v>

162
00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:11.930
<v Speaker 1>the advice they shouldn't be taking advice from those people with regards to</v>

163
00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:12.500
<v Speaker 1>their policy.</v>

164
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.150
<v Speaker 1>And apparently that makes me a racist.</v>

165
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:15.170
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

166
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:15.500
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

167
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:19.220
<v Speaker 1>the first part of the argument about what happened with my videos was actually</v>

168
00:07:19.221 --> 00:07:22.220
<v Speaker 1>whether or not I was racist and Trans phobic and all of that.</v>

169
00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:27.380
<v Speaker 1>But the point that I was making the technical specific technical point was that</v>

170
00:07:27.381 --> 00:07:28.820
<v Speaker 1>the claim that,</v>

171
00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

172
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:34.700
<v Speaker 1>those four phenomena very independently was just patently false.</v>

173
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:38.120
<v Speaker 1>And it is by any reasonable definition of false.</v>

174
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:43.630
<v Speaker 1>And I know that it's part of a much broader propaganda exercise as evidenced by</v>

175
00:07:43.701 --> 00:07:45.320
<v Speaker 1>the Gender Unicorn for example,</v>

176
00:07:45.321 --> 00:07:50.321
<v Speaker 1>which gets children to indicate on four sliders their sex assigned at birth,</v>

177
00:07:51.051 --> 00:07:52.190
<v Speaker 1>their gender identity,</v>

178
00:07:52.191 --> 00:07:54.770
<v Speaker 1>their gender expression and their sexual proclivity.</v>

179
00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:59.570
<v Speaker 1>And you can look at the animation or at the at the cartoon and decide for</v>

180
00:07:59.571 --> 00:08:03.810
<v Speaker 1>yourself by its graphic style what people it's aimed at.</v>

181
00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:05.143
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

182
00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:06.143
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

183
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:11.620
<v Speaker 1>is this a bill to protect transsexual rights or is it a bill to further a</v>

184
00:08:13.191 --> 00:08:15.410
<v Speaker 1>postmodern neo Marxist agenda?</v>

185
00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:20.360
<v Speaker 1>Well God only knows but as far as I'm concerned having analyze the context</v>

186
00:08:20.361 --> 00:08:25.040
<v Speaker 1>within which this bill arose and within which it will be interpreted,</v>

187
00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:30.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go for the furthering the postmodern Neil Marxist agenda until I'm,</v>

188
00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:32.540
<v Speaker 1>until that's thoroughly disproved.</v>

189
00:08:32.541 --> 00:08:36.710
<v Speaker 1>I would also like to inform you that I've had plenty of letters from transgender</v>

190
00:08:36.711 --> 00:08:37.544
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

191
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:42.490
<v Speaker 1>at least 30 and only one of them was critical of what I'm doing because they had</v>

192
00:08:42.491 --> 00:08:43.370
<v Speaker 1>claim and as,</v>

193
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:48.820
<v Speaker 1>as have many of the people I've talked to that the idea that a group of</v>

194
00:08:49.821 --> 00:08:54.821
<v Speaker 1>activists self can self nominate as the representatives of a given group.</v>

195
00:08:56.671 --> 00:09:01.671
<v Speaker 1>And then speak for them as if they have a homogenous voice is absolutely absurd.</v>

196
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:02.820
<v Speaker 1>And it is.</v>

197
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:04.500
<v Speaker 1>It is completely ridiculous.</v>

198
00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:09.540
<v Speaker 1>And most of the transsexual people that have been contacting me have said the</v>

199
00:09:09.541 --> 00:09:10.141
<v Speaker 1>same thing,</v>

200
00:09:10.141 --> 00:09:12.570
<v Speaker 1>which is these people don't speak for me.</v>

201
00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:17.400
<v Speaker 1>I wish they'd shut up cause they're doing a lot more harm than good and I don't</v>

202
00:09:17.401 --> 00:09:19.620
<v Speaker 1>buy what they're doing anyways.</v>

203
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:20.603
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

204
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:21.743
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

205
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:27.090
<v Speaker 1>I think that the claim of the activist types to speak on behalf of the groups</v>

206
00:09:27.091 --> 00:09:29.610
<v Speaker 1>that they purport to represent is weak at best.</v>

207
00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:31.480
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know why we ever assume that,</v>

208
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:33.900
<v Speaker 1>that their representation is valid,</v>

209
00:09:33.901 --> 00:09:37.650
<v Speaker 1>except that we're afraid to criticize that particular presupposition.</v>

210
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:38.221
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

211
00:09:38.221 --> 00:09:38.461
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

212
00:09:38.461 --> 00:09:42.510
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing more ridiculous than assuming that someone is because someone is</v>

213
00:09:42.511 --> 00:09:44.610
<v Speaker 1>black that they speak for black people.</v>

214
00:09:44.611 --> 00:09:45.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

215
00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:45.840
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

216
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:50.010
<v Speaker 1>I can't think of anything that's more particularly indicative of a fundamentally</v>

217
00:09:50.011 --> 00:09:51.690
<v Speaker 1>racist attitude than that.</v>

218
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.051
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

219
00:09:52.051 --> 00:09:52.980
<v Speaker 1>Well those people,</v>

220
00:09:52.981 --> 00:09:54.120
<v Speaker 1>they're all the same.</v>

221
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:54.571
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

222
00:09:54.571 --> 00:09:54.841
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

223
00:09:54.841 --> 00:09:55.230
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

224
00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:56.063
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

225
00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:57.360
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't work out that way.</v>

226
00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:01.260
<v Speaker 1>So I wanted to clarify all that so that you know,</v>

227
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.960
<v Speaker 1>you have a little bit clearer idea about why I was doing what I was doing and</v>

228
00:10:05.961 --> 00:10:08.190
<v Speaker 1>people have asked so to speak,</v>

229
00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:10.830
<v Speaker 1>why I chose to die on that particular hale.</v>

230
00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:12.810
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is every,</v>

231
00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:18.320
<v Speaker 1>every massive conflict of ideas let's say manifests itself in the minute.</v>

232
00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:24.270
<v Speaker 1>And that's why it's often difficult to gain any headway because no matter where</v>

233
00:10:24.271 --> 00:10:25.260
<v Speaker 1>you draw the line,</v>

234
00:10:25.261 --> 00:10:26.330
<v Speaker 1>it's arbitrary and,</v>

235
00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:28.260
<v Speaker 1>and subject to criticism.</v>

236
00:10:28.261 --> 00:10:28.801
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

237
00:10:28.801 --> 00:10:33.801
<v Speaker 1>the fact that this happens to be about gender neutral pronouns regarding</v>

238
00:10:33.871 --> 00:10:37.230
<v Speaker 1>transgender people to me is just more or less an accident.</v>

239
00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:39.760
<v Speaker 1>It could have been about almost any number of other things and,</v>

240
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:44.070
<v Speaker 1>but I would also like to suggest that what should have happened with what I did</v>

241
00:10:44.071 --> 00:10:44.940
<v Speaker 1>was nothing.</v>

242
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:45.510
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

243
00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:50.510
<v Speaker 1>I made some videos that were relatively obscure academic and I made some videos</v>

244
00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.610
<v Speaker 1>in my private time that were,</v>

245
00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:53.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

246
00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:56.460
<v Speaker 1>pretty badly produced because they're just amateur.</v>

247
00:10:56.461 --> 00:11:00.180
<v Speaker 1>And I was trying to straighten out my thinking about a couple of issues,</v>

248
00:11:00.181 --> 00:11:02.310
<v Speaker 1>the anti unconscious bias training,</v>

249
00:11:02.311 --> 00:11:03.144
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

250
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.880
<v Speaker 1>and also this legislative mass.</v>

251
00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:09.210
<v Speaker 1>And obviously it struck a major chord.</v>

252
00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:14.390
<v Speaker 1>And that to me is indication that my original supposition was correct and that</v>

253
00:11:14.791 --> 00:11:18.450
<v Speaker 1>there was far more going on under the surface than there was at the surface.</v>

254
00:11:18.451 --> 00:11:18.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

255
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:19.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

256
00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:20.191
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

257
00:11:20.191 --> 00:11:22.620
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to pick the proper level of analysis,</v>

258
00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:28.020
<v Speaker 1>but one of the ways you justify your choices by observing the impact of your</v>

259
00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:30.480
<v Speaker 1>choice of level of analysis and seeing if it's,</v>

260
00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:34.590
<v Speaker 1>if the consequences are commensurate with your original hypothesis.</v>

261
00:11:34.591 --> 00:11:35.161
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

262
00:11:35.161 --> 00:11:35.994
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

263
00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:41.070
<v Speaker 1>just because people say they're doing one thing with a piece of legislation</v>

264
00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:43.260
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean that that's what they're doing.</v>

265
00:11:43.261 --> 00:11:44.094
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>

266
00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.470
<v Speaker 1>I led piece of legislation is a hydra.</v>

267
00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:47.670
<v Speaker 1>In any case,</v>

268
00:11:47.671 --> 00:11:50.370
<v Speaker 1>it does all sorts of things that people don't intend it to do.</v>

269
00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:55.950
<v Speaker 1>So that's a little background and I'll leave the background at that.</v>
