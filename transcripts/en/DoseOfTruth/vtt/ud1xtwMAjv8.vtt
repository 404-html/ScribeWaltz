<v Speaker 1>It's</v>

2
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.750
<v Speaker 1>limited and there is a zero tolerance policy</v>

3
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.180
<v Speaker 1>or disruption.</v>

<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

7
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:21.423
<v Speaker 2>thank you very</v>

8
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.400
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>

9
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.233
<v Speaker 2>Appreciate</v>

10
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.990
<v Speaker 2>to be here at this beautiful.</v>

11
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.530
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to talk to you tonight.</v>

12
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.050
<v Speaker 2>Suffering from some trepidation regards for this talk is</v>

13
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.240
<v Speaker 2>probably the most difficult of the talks that I give</v>

14
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.093
<v Speaker 2>and take.</v>

15
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.830
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

16
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.090
<v Speaker 2>it's basing on</v>

17
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:59.230
<v Speaker 2>much of the material and I'm going to discuss with you tonight in room 60 12</v>

18
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.400
<v Speaker 2>rules for like which is put your house in perfect order before you criticize the</v>

19
00:02:06.221 --> 00:02:11.221
<v Speaker 2>world and it's constantly and the discussion that surrounds it,</v>

20
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.033
<v Speaker 2>is it</v>

21
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.960
<v Speaker 2>a problem that I interned to Seoul for very little time and sold means two</v>

22
00:02:21.971 --> 00:02:22.391
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

23
00:02:22.391 --> 00:02:25.720
<v Speaker 2>It needs to clearly formulate girl,</v>

24
00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.010
<v Speaker 2>which is actually the most difficult part of solving the problem.</v>

25
00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.900
<v Speaker 2>Once you,</v>

26
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.650
<v Speaker 2>once you can formulate the problem,</v>

27
00:02:32.651 --> 00:02:35.460
<v Speaker 2>it's fairly easy to lay on possibilities,</v>

28
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.260
<v Speaker 2>but to clearly communicate the problem is very difficult.</v>

29
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.390
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean solving isn't necessarily easy,</v>

30
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.233
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

31
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.300
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

32
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.150
<v Speaker 2>so to solve that problem needs to formulate,</v>

33
00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.460
<v Speaker 2>but also they need to to articulate it the problem deeply enough so that in</v>

34
00:02:51.881 --> 00:02:53.590
<v Speaker 2>principle it might go away.</v>

35
00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.730
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

36
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.490
<v Speaker 2>if you have an argument with someone in your family,</v>

37
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.120
<v Speaker 2>your or your husband or the sibling,</v>

38
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.600
<v Speaker 2>there's a real conflict around it.</v>

39
00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.170
<v Speaker 2>If you formulated conflict properly and you walked through it,</v>

40
00:03:08.171 --> 00:03:11.070
<v Speaker 2>then you don't have to have to fight anymore because you've,</v>

41
00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.470
<v Speaker 2>you've negotiated a settlement,</v>

42
00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.790
<v Speaker 2>the problem disappears and that's actually how you moved.</v>

43
00:03:15.791 --> 00:03:18.400
<v Speaker 2>If you understand something is that the problem disappears.</v>

44
00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:19.770
<v Speaker 2>That takes care of principle.</v>

45
00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:25.210
<v Speaker 2>And so the problem that I want to talk to you about tonight is I want to make a</v>

46
00:03:27.321 --> 00:03:28.360
<v Speaker 2>product specific.</v>

47
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.080
<v Speaker 2>I spent a lot of time thinking about totalitarianism in,</v>

48
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm very interested in both of those topics interested in ideological</v>

49
00:03:41.141 --> 00:03:41.760
<v Speaker 2>possession,</v>

50
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.760
<v Speaker 2>but I'm more interested in something that's the most extreme variant of</v>

51
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.060
<v Speaker 2>physiological possession and see it.</v>

52
00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:54.061
<v Speaker 2>And that's the proclivity of people to use unbelievably brutal means of</v>

53
00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:58.423
<v Speaker 2>enforcing.</v>

54
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.840
<v Speaker 2>It carries to the ideology because etiology in itself is a mystery.</v>

55
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.230
<v Speaker 2>Why can't we believe the fix that they do,</v>

56
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.530
<v Speaker 2>but why they're willing to use,</v>

57
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.900
<v Speaker 2>why they're willing to commit atrocities in the service of those ideologies is a</v>

58
00:04:16.901 --> 00:04:17.920
<v Speaker 2>bunch of deeper history.</v>

59
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:23.530
<v Speaker 2>And one of the stories that really affected me when I was studying what happened</v>

60
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.580
<v Speaker 2>in Nazi Germany and indigo light counts of the Soviet Union because those were</v>

61
00:04:29.321 --> 00:04:31.660
<v Speaker 2>the two forms of massive trust,</v>

62
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.840
<v Speaker 2>let's say that I dealt into intervals deeply was a story that never really left</v>

63
00:04:38.261 --> 00:04:39.400
<v Speaker 2>my imagination.</v>

64
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:45.060
<v Speaker 2>This was a story or something that was inflicted upon my prisoners in our shorts</v>

65
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.440
<v Speaker 2>during the time of the Nazi concentration camps.</v>

66
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:52.630
<v Speaker 2>Do you understand that?</v>

67
00:04:52.631 --> 00:04:53.381
<v Speaker 2>Something like that,</v>

68
00:04:53.381 --> 00:04:55.190
<v Speaker 2>you kind of have to put yourself there.</v>

69
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:56.140
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

70
00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.980
<v Speaker 2>and that's an uncomfortable thing to do for all sorts of reasons.</v>

71
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.010
<v Speaker 2>You can put yourself there as victim,</v>

72
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.090
<v Speaker 2>which is actually more comfortable and get some sense.</v>

73
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.641
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's not,</v>

74
00:05:04.641 --> 00:05:05.474
<v Speaker 2>but it's comforting,</v>

75
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.530
<v Speaker 2>but your option is basically victim or perpetrator,</v>

76
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.831
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

77
00:05:08.831 --> 00:05:10.600
<v Speaker 2>Take a situation like that.</v>

78
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.420
<v Speaker 2>I think it's easier for people to imagine themselves as victim.</v>

79
00:05:13.421 --> 00:05:16.210
<v Speaker 2>It's not that that's easy cause it's not,</v>

80
00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.400
<v Speaker 2>it's a paragraph to attempt,</v>

81
00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:20.740
<v Speaker 2>but it's nowhere near as error.</v>

82
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.400
<v Speaker 2>Generally speaking as it is to hazard herself a perpetrator.</v>

83
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.150
<v Speaker 2>You might not be willing to do that,</v>

84
00:05:28.151 --> 00:05:32.320
<v Speaker 2>but that's actually a mistake because unless you're willing to think that the</v>

85
00:05:32.321 --> 00:05:37.321
<v Speaker 2>sorts of people who perpetrated the catastrophes of Nazi Germany and the Stella</v>

86
00:05:39.291 --> 00:05:41.380
<v Speaker 2>was Soviet Union and I was China,</v>

87
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:42.723
<v Speaker 2>Cambodia,</v>

88
00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:43.451
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>

89
00:05:43.451 --> 00:05:44.284
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>

90
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.930
<v Speaker 2>we thought we added including North Korea,</v>

91
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.670
<v Speaker 2>including now then is the way that this neighbor and that means that the people</v>

92
00:05:51.671 --> 00:05:56.671
<v Speaker 2>who do it aren't a different species that you then are the same and I don't</v>

93
00:05:57.861 --> 00:06:02.861
<v Speaker 2>really think that we're ever going to be able to stop that sort of thing so it</v>

94
00:06:03.981 --> 00:06:08.981
<v Speaker 2>can be stopped and interviewed the case without reading those situations as if</v>

95
00:06:10.401 --> 00:06:15.230
<v Speaker 2>we're the perpetrators and that's a terrible thing to do and fucking,</v>

96
00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that there's any way would the situation without understanding</v>

97
00:06:19.551 --> 00:06:20.360
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

98
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.930
<v Speaker 2>One of the things I often encourage my students can understand when they're</v>

99
00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:29.570
<v Speaker 2>contemplating history and reading history is that they stop reading history like</v>

100
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.840
<v Speaker 2>it's something that happened in the past and start reading like it's an</v>

101
00:06:32.841 --> 00:06:35.960
<v Speaker 2>autobiography because it's much more effective.</v>

102
00:06:35.961 --> 00:06:37.460
<v Speaker 2>You're a historical creature.</v>

103
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:38.960
<v Speaker 2>When you read about history,</v>

104
00:06:38.961 --> 00:06:42.980
<v Speaker 2>when you read history you are grieving about now you might not know that because</v>

105
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.170
<v Speaker 2>you're not every form of human.</v>

106
00:06:45.171 --> 00:06:48.680
<v Speaker 2>You could be like your whatever particular form.</v>

107
00:06:48.681 --> 00:06:50.490
<v Speaker 2>Huge choke right here,</v>

108
00:06:50.491 --> 00:06:53.660
<v Speaker 2>right now about you have the potential,</v>

109
00:06:53.661 --> 00:06:56.520
<v Speaker 2>but the ending for a multiplicity of beings,</v>

110
00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.270
<v Speaker 2>I think it was Alexander Pope who said,</v>

111
00:06:59.271 --> 00:07:00.440
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly,</v>

112
00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.300
<v Speaker 2>nothing human is foreign.</v>

113
00:07:02.301 --> 00:07:04.790
<v Speaker 2>To me that's a hell of a statement.</v>

114
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:08.870
<v Speaker 2>On the upside it's really quite something because there's obviously deep great</v>

115
00:07:08.871 --> 00:07:09.231
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

116
00:07:09.231 --> 00:07:11.570
<v Speaker 2>but on the downside it's reading something to,</v>

117
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:17.200
<v Speaker 2>and so to develop a detailed self understanding is to develop an understanding</v>

118
00:07:18.111 --> 00:07:19.190
<v Speaker 2>that enables you to,</v>

119
00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:21.110
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

120
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.650
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

121
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.840
<v Speaker 2>to understand what your affiliation with the,</v>

122
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:25.700
<v Speaker 2>with the Nazi camp guards.</v>

123
00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:27.830
<v Speaker 2>And that's a very unpleasant thing.</v>

124
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:32.210
<v Speaker 2>So the situation with Asha,</v>

125
00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.010
<v Speaker 2>let's say it was,</v>

126
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:37.400
<v Speaker 2>people were brought there often in Cali cars,</v>

127
00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:42.460
<v Speaker 2>often in either freezing weather or in very hot butter and they're all crammed</v>

128
00:07:42.741 --> 00:07:47.741
<v Speaker 2>together in cattle car standing mostly as many people as they possibly be</v>

129
00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:48.973
<v Speaker 2>crammed in.</v>

130
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.000
<v Speaker 2>And what that meant was many of them died on the way there.</v>

131
00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:57.010
<v Speaker 2>They die of heat exhaustion or they froze to death if they are on the outer</v>

132
00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:01.230
<v Speaker 2>sides of the car or they suffocate or,</v>

133
00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:03.530
<v Speaker 2>and so it's always,</v>

134
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.410
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult to lens and how terrible that has to be.</v>

135
00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:10.970
<v Speaker 2>And then of course they arrived at accounts and they were sorted into people who</v>

136
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:16.240
<v Speaker 2>from whom some useful labor might conceivably be extracted or those who were due</v>

137
00:08:17.081 --> 00:08:19.220
<v Speaker 2>to a relatively immediate death.</v>

138
00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:23.210
<v Speaker 2>And then that's all bad enough,</v>

139
00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:23.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

140
00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:24.590
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

141
00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:29.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean these people were innocent to begin with and then they were separated</v>

142
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.120
<v Speaker 2>under brutal conditions from their,</v>

143
00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:33.230
<v Speaker 2>from their life.</v>

144
00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:36.440
<v Speaker 2>And so from their past and the present feminists future,</v>

145
00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:38.300
<v Speaker 2>absolutely traumatizing.</v>

146
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.520
<v Speaker 2>The families were destroyed,</v>

147
00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.860
<v Speaker 2>everything was taken away from them.</v>

148
00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:48.610
<v Speaker 2>They were treated as badly as animals are treated when they're treated badly and</v>

149
00:08:49.311 --> 00:08:49.770
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

150
00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:51.860
<v Speaker 2>and they were brought to these accounts and the counselor.</v>

151
00:08:51.861 --> 00:08:54.680
<v Speaker 2>Cute places like the size of small cities.</v>

152
00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:57.660
<v Speaker 2>Can you think of cow weight to the city?</v>

153
00:08:57.661 --> 00:08:59.370
<v Speaker 2>But really that's what they were.</v>

154
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:03.210
<v Speaker 2>But that wasn't enough for the people who ran an account,</v>

155
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:07.260
<v Speaker 2>which is really something because you think that would be enough no matter how</v>

156
00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:08.940
<v Speaker 2>what we're motivated by,</v>

157
00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:10.950
<v Speaker 2>you might think that that would do the trick,</v>

158
00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:12.060
<v Speaker 2>you know fundamentally,</v>

159
00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:13.490
<v Speaker 2>but it really didn't do the trick.</v>

160
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:18.710
<v Speaker 2>You know there there was a sign over Auschwitz which was stolen last year.</v>

161
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:24.030
<v Speaker 2>Take this side assisted and maybe in many barriers as if there was only one of</v>

162
00:09:24.031 --> 00:09:27.600
<v Speaker 2>them and I can't say the German or something like perfect connect.</v>

163
00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:31.400
<v Speaker 2>Free maturely is lacking but it needs work.</v>

164
00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:32.820
<v Speaker 2>We'll set it free.</v>

165
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:35.160
<v Speaker 2>That was the little model,</v>

166
00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:36.003
<v Speaker 2>the account.</v>

167
00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:39.990
<v Speaker 2>That's also really stuck in my mind because it was a joke.</v>

168
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.280
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

169
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.600
<v Speaker 2>it's actually a chill.</v>

170
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:48.200
<v Speaker 2>It's really something to think of a mind that would conceptualize that Jill and</v>

171
00:09:48.441 --> 00:09:50.110
<v Speaker 2>put it in that sort of place.</v>

172
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:53.810
<v Speaker 2>Work rules free camp.</v>

173
00:09:53.811 --> 00:09:56.210
<v Speaker 2>It was designed to work people to death.</v>

174
00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.020
<v Speaker 2>Not even for the work they didn't do.</v>

175
00:09:58.660 --> 00:09:58.860
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

176
00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:03.120
<v Speaker 2>because if the Nazis would've had any sense and if they wouldn't be motivated by</v>

177
00:10:03.121 --> 00:10:04.260
<v Speaker 2>what they say they would,</v>

178
00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:05.610
<v Speaker 2>we're motivated by,</v>

179
00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:07.120
<v Speaker 2>they would just said the cap itself.</v>

180
00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:08.730
<v Speaker 2>In a much more humane manner.</v>

181
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:09.960
<v Speaker 2>They would have used the people,</v>

182
00:10:09.961 --> 00:10:13.630
<v Speaker 2>they put in accounts as slaves to further the war effort and they might've won</v>

183
00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:14.070
<v Speaker 2>the war,</v>

184
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:15.060
<v Speaker 2>but that isn't what they did.</v>

185
00:10:15.061 --> 00:10:18.030
<v Speaker 2>They brought them to Jews and the Gypsies and all the other people.</v>

186
00:10:18.031 --> 00:10:22.610
<v Speaker 2>They decided where we're worth having around each of the couch.</v>

187
00:10:22.611 --> 00:10:26.490
<v Speaker 2>He just basically work the point to be the death and the reason for that was</v>

188
00:10:26.491 --> 00:10:29.000
<v Speaker 2>because that was the way you can make the depth.</v>

189
00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:29.491
<v Speaker 2>The worst.</v>

190
00:10:29.491 --> 00:10:33.780
<v Speaker 2>It could be the hope because they usually work as a punishment.</v>

191
00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:37.420
<v Speaker 2>You don't if you work utility work.</v>

192
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:39.570
<v Speaker 2>Soldiered isn't talked about this as a ghoulag.</v>

193
00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:40.261
<v Speaker 2>When he was there,</v>

194
00:10:40.261 --> 00:10:40.561
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

195
00:10:40.561 --> 00:10:41.090
<v Speaker 2>well at least,</v>

196
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:43.230
<v Speaker 2>but he was laying bricks as a prisoner.</v>

197
00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:46.320
<v Speaker 2>He had the Grad gratification,</v>

198
00:10:46.321 --> 00:10:48.750
<v Speaker 2>let's say if they need to build a straight wall of bricks,</v>

199
00:10:48.751 --> 00:10:52.290
<v Speaker 2>like there was something about productive Labor that he's engaging in productive</v>

200
00:10:52.291 --> 00:10:57.291
<v Speaker 2>Labor that they need to find at least see some tiny shred of useful meaning in</v>

201
00:10:57.631 --> 00:10:58.950
<v Speaker 2>this absolutely dismal,</v>

202
00:10:58.951 --> 00:10:59.760
<v Speaker 2>wretched herder,</v>

203
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:00.720
<v Speaker 2>a circumstance.</v>

204
00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:06.140
<v Speaker 2>But there were people who were running the camps like Auschwitz who wanted to</v>

205
00:11:06.331 --> 00:11:06.601
<v Speaker 2>take,</v>

206
00:11:06.601 --> 00:11:08.700
<v Speaker 2>even now the way it worse than that,</v>

207
00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:09.603
<v Speaker 2>convert it.</v>

208
00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:13.500
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things that the camp guards used to do to the new prisoners</v>

209
00:11:13.501 --> 00:11:16.140
<v Speaker 2>was to have them pick up wet socks,</v>

210
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:17.730
<v Speaker 2>wet 100 pounds,</v>

211
00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:22.290
<v Speaker 2>100 pound sacks of went Saul and then carry them on their backs.</v>

212
00:11:22.291 --> 00:11:24.810
<v Speaker 2>And then you remember I already told you that these people had already been</v>

213
00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:27.810
<v Speaker 2>through from one side of that account to the other.</v>

214
00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:30.730
<v Speaker 2>But that wasn't enough either.</v>

215
00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:35.580
<v Speaker 2>Even though there was no reason you can move the soul and it was only a</v>

216
00:11:35.581 --> 00:11:36.700
<v Speaker 2>demonstration of power,</v>

217
00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:38.450
<v Speaker 2>demonstration of the sub,</v>

218
00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:43.320
<v Speaker 2>absolute subjugation of the prisoners to this,</v>

219
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:44.251
<v Speaker 2>what would you call it?</v>

220
00:11:44.251 --> 00:11:46.290
<v Speaker 2>Universal human necessity for work.</v>

221
00:11:46.291 --> 00:11:47.110
<v Speaker 2>We have to work,</v>

222
00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:47.490
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

223
00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:52.070
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the curses God glazed donuts at the end of the story about me.</v>

224
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:56.860
<v Speaker 2>People have deployed and you can find meaning in that inverted,</v>

225
00:11:57.110 --> 00:12:00.880
<v Speaker 2>it becomes a torture and you do that by making it pointless,</v>

226
00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:02.960
<v Speaker 2>difficult appointments.</v>

227
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:08.230
<v Speaker 2>So the carrier that sacral quit salt from one side of the camp,</v>

228
00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:09.860
<v Speaker 2>how resolve PC,</v>

229
00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:14.410
<v Speaker 2>a parody of work and that was what the joke referred to parody of work.</v>

230
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:15.670
<v Speaker 2>But that wasn't enough either.</v>

231
00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:17.650
<v Speaker 2>They had good cherry back.</v>

232
00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:18.710
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

233
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:20.220
<v Speaker 2>You think there's a real part of the screen,</v>

234
00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:23.320
<v Speaker 2>the same artist that came up with a joke.</v>

235
00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.270
<v Speaker 2>There's something about that that system,</v>

236
00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:30.360
<v Speaker 2>it's almost dark and that would be trained to understand that.</v>

237
00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:32.590
<v Speaker 2>Why is that exactly?</v>

238
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:37.240
<v Speaker 2>It's not like it's a question it's gone up with vote.</v>

239
00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:41.500
<v Speaker 2>Although it's a question when people don't like to ask or answer,</v>

240
00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:42.673
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

241
00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:44.880
<v Speaker 2>in your country and in mine,</v>

242
00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.273
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

243
00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:50.020
<v Speaker 2>we have this spectacle of the mass murder.</v>

244
00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:55.270
<v Speaker 2>It's a competitive game that often young men played and you know,</v>

245
00:12:55.271 --> 00:12:58.610
<v Speaker 2>I call it the game for good reason.</v>

246
00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:02.170
<v Speaker 2>That competitive game for good reason that the mass murders school shooters,</v>

247
00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.750
<v Speaker 2>those sorts of people that keep track of each other.</v>

248
00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:07.100
<v Speaker 2>Now they tried to up the engine.</v>

249
00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:08.480
<v Speaker 2>Each cap,</v>

250
00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:13.990
<v Speaker 2>the most egregious should have was probably the one at Sandy Hook I would say</v>

251
00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:16.540
<v Speaker 2>for the elementary school kids who are killed.</v>

252
00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:18.820
<v Speaker 2>Because that brings up another level of mystery.</v>

253
00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.710
<v Speaker 2>It's like why go after the innocence?</v>

254
00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.720
<v Speaker 2>If you're altered for her revenge,</v>

255
00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:31.980
<v Speaker 2>why not punish the guilty and sort of that because it's more effective to punish</v>

256
00:13:32.081 --> 00:13:35.900
<v Speaker 2>the innocent because it's more of a violation.</v>

257
00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:39.410
<v Speaker 2>It's a greater violation of good,</v>

258
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:40.021
<v Speaker 2>let's say it's,</v>

259
00:13:40.021 --> 00:13:40.200
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

260
00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.390
<v Speaker 2>it's a more evil and it's,</v>

261
00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.790
<v Speaker 2>it's a more vegetable active,</v>

262
00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:43.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

263
00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:47.430
<v Speaker 2>perhaps the most data sets of the innocent might be elementary school children,</v>

264
00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.300
<v Speaker 2>especially ones that you don't know.</v>

265
00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:52.150
<v Speaker 2>And so the killer of the sandy hook killer,</v>

266
00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:54.580
<v Speaker 2>something like he didn't think this through.</v>

267
00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:55.930
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

268
00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:57.310
<v Speaker 2>And that's another thing to consider.</v>

269
00:13:57.311 --> 00:14:01.670
<v Speaker 2>You don't get to the point where you to do something like that on a win already</v>

270
00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:02.680
<v Speaker 2>taking months,</v>

271
00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:03.310
<v Speaker 2>months,</v>

272
00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:08.310
<v Speaker 2>months or even years of dark fantasizing before you get to that point.</v>

273
00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:14.130
<v Speaker 2>And you can go places that are hardly imaginable when you allow yourself to be</v>

274
00:14:15.221 --> 00:14:19.120
<v Speaker 2>taken over by the kind of spirit that produces that kind of fantasy.</v>

275
00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:20.100
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

276
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:20.751
<v Speaker 2>And where do you go?</v>

277
00:14:20.751 --> 00:14:25.751
<v Speaker 2>It's a place where you think that bringing them a deadly weapon into an</v>

278
00:14:26.081 --> 00:14:31.081
<v Speaker 2>elementary school and deliberately targeted it is the children,</v>

279
00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:33.820
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

280
00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:37.960
<v Speaker 2>is actually a goal that's reasonable to pursuit.</v>

281
00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:43.660
<v Speaker 2>Now you see this most recently,</v>

282
00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:48.720
<v Speaker 2>very recently in Toronto or a band who was apparently frustrated by his lack of</v>

283
00:14:49.151 --> 00:14:51.290
<v Speaker 2>success in the dating market,</v>

284
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:52.550
<v Speaker 2>or at least that was the,</v>

285
00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:53.091
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>

286
00:14:53.091 --> 00:14:58.091
<v Speaker 2>the accused rented a van and jump on the sidewalk 12 off on sidewalks,</v>

287
00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:02.010
<v Speaker 2>which is very long time,</v>

288
00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:02.270
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

289
00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:04.160
<v Speaker 2>It's not a casual,</v>

290
00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:05.090
<v Speaker 2>aggressive,</v>

291
00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:08.040
<v Speaker 2>impulsive women Christmas years.</v>

292
00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:11.480
<v Speaker 2>Your hand on the steering wheel in your hands because you're angry and you see a</v>

293
00:15:11.481 --> 00:15:12.291
<v Speaker 2>crowd of people.</v>

294
00:15:12.291 --> 00:15:13.200
<v Speaker 2>It's not fat.</v>

295
00:15:13.201 --> 00:15:13.410
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

296
00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:13.880
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

297
00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:14.601
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>

298
00:15:14.601 --> 00:15:15.440
<v Speaker 2>very deliberate.</v>

299
00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:19.130
<v Speaker 2>And to hit people one by one,</v>

300
00:15:19.131 --> 00:15:21.560
<v Speaker 2>you know when it continual sequence like that.</v>

301
00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:26.090
<v Speaker 2>And then I talked to a journalist who had seen this man the next day when he was</v>

302
00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:26.924
<v Speaker 2>raped in court.</v>

303
00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:30.850
<v Speaker 2>She said that he walked into the courtroom like someone who was there for board.</v>

304
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:32.750
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

305
00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:38.810
<v Speaker 2>so there's this constellation of action.</v>

306
00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:44.320
<v Speaker 2>I think that the only proper way to describe those options is as evil actions.</v>

307
00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.400
<v Speaker 2>That is a metaphysical statement,</v>

308
00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.160
<v Speaker 2>some sense because you describe it,</v>

309
00:15:50.161 --> 00:15:55.161
<v Speaker 2>the options as equal as to also with simultaneously proclaim the reality of good</v>

310
00:15:56.331 --> 00:15:57.650
<v Speaker 2>and evil in the world.</v>

311
00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:02.660
<v Speaker 2>But that doesn't really bother me because I can't see that there's any</v>

312
00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.300
<v Speaker 2>alternative language.</v>

313
00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:08.210
<v Speaker 2>It's useful to describe those sorts of advances.</v>

314
00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:10.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean you might not agree with that.</v>

315
00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.230
<v Speaker 2>You might take of,</v>

316
00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:18.080
<v Speaker 2>you might not think that that's the appropriate by imagine within which to close</v>

317
00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:19.213
<v Speaker 2>such events.</v>

318
00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.290
<v Speaker 2>I do the appropriate language.</v>

319
00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:22.850
<v Speaker 2>And that being said,</v>

320
00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:24.380
<v Speaker 2>in order to understand those events,</v>

321
00:16:24.381 --> 00:16:27.230
<v Speaker 2>you have to speak a language with good and evil.</v>

322
00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.920
<v Speaker 2>And I do believe this to be true and I can tell you why in part,</v>

323
00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:32.810
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that's happened to me,</v>

324
00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:38.020
<v Speaker 2>I didn't lecture online the distinction between tragedy and evil and I think</v>

325
00:16:39.211 --> 00:16:42.090
<v Speaker 2>he's one of the most effective but the directly liberty.</v>

326
00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:43.400
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

327
00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:44.660
<v Speaker 2>I started to say brigade,</v>

328
00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.710
<v Speaker 2>I would conceptually earthquakes and cancer,</v>

329
00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:50.240
<v Speaker 2>you know the standard catastrophes of life,</v>

330
00:16:50.241 --> 00:16:52.100
<v Speaker 2>that CPP perpetrator,</v>

331
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000
<v Speaker 2>acts of God so to speak and very hard on people obviously and often Danthony</v>

332
00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:03.110
<v Speaker 2>from the level of attacks which are deadening in the same manner and you might</v>

333
00:17:03.111 --> 00:17:05.160
<v Speaker 2>think therefore the same thing.</v>

334
00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:06.510
<v Speaker 2>They're not the same thing.</v>

335
00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:10.730
<v Speaker 2>Their tragedy is one thing and malevolence is another thing and the level of</v>

336
00:17:10.731 --> 00:17:11.361
<v Speaker 2>tragedies,</v>

337
00:17:11.361 --> 00:17:12.410
<v Speaker 2>but worst of things,</v>

338
00:17:12.411 --> 00:17:15.590
<v Speaker 2>and we actually don't as clinicians if we're awake,</v>

339
00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:19.340
<v Speaker 2>has clinical all of those because one of the things that it's quite well</v>

340
00:17:19.341 --> 00:17:24.341
<v Speaker 2>documented in the claim in the literature is what causes post traumatic stress</v>

341
00:17:25.101 --> 00:17:27.560
<v Speaker 2>disorder and generally speaking,</v>

342
00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:31.080
<v Speaker 2>it isn't exposure to tragedies that caused this poster and</v>

343
00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:37.760
<v Speaker 2>usually what goes as close to his exposure to malevolence.</v>

344
00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:40.030
<v Speaker 2>So not only do you have to be heard,</v>

345
00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:45.090
<v Speaker 2>let's say you have to be hurt by someone who is intended for now.</v>

346
00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:46.341
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm very,</v>

347
00:17:46.341 --> 00:17:50.430
<v Speaker 2>the other variance of this often happens to soldiers going to bow down and they</v>

348
00:17:50.431 --> 00:17:54.510
<v Speaker 2>observe themselves in something that's deeply malevolent and they never knew</v>

349
00:17:54.511 --> 00:17:58.320
<v Speaker 2>that they had been asking for that perhaps does partner in that even enjoys it,</v>

350
00:17:58.321 --> 00:18:02.940
<v Speaker 2>at least in the moment logo and afterwards they're fragmented by the</v>

351
00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:03.803
<v Speaker 2>consequences.</v>

352
00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:06.960
<v Speaker 2>Say people who were perhaps somewhat too naive,</v>

353
00:18:06.961 --> 00:18:08.490
<v Speaker 2>he can make effective soldiers.</v>

354
00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:09.593
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

355
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.990
<v Speaker 2>they observe themselves doing something terrible that the battlefield and then</v>

356
00:18:12.991 --> 00:18:15.390
<v Speaker 2>they're broken and they cannot be repaired.</v>

357
00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:16.510
<v Speaker 2>And I've had many heart,</v>

358
00:18:16.511 --> 00:18:18.150
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult for them to be repaired.</v>

359
00:18:18.151 --> 00:18:23.151
<v Speaker 2>And I've had many people like that contact me and say that because of the watch,</v>

360
00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:24.990
<v Speaker 2>this lecture hall,</v>

361
00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:27.300
<v Speaker 2>the Distinction Between Tragedy and evil,</v>

362
00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:31.380
<v Speaker 2>they have been able to recover at least in part from the post traumatic stress</v>

363
00:18:31.381 --> 00:18:32.214
<v Speaker 2>disorder.</v>

364
00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:32.971
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

365
00:18:32.971 --> 00:18:34.580
<v Speaker 2>and in my own clinical practice,</v>

366
00:18:34.581 --> 00:18:35.550
<v Speaker 2>when I treated people,</v>

367
00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:39.870
<v Speaker 2>I had a client who was a young woman and she had been bullied very badly.</v>

368
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:44.870
<v Speaker 2>Buddy boy who she did not want to go out with it after that made it his life's</v>

369
00:18:45.721 --> 00:18:50.190
<v Speaker 2>work to bring her down when she get very effectively with his friends and he</v>

370
00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:53.160
<v Speaker 2>pulled her into a state of absolute psychosis.</v>

371
00:18:53.161 --> 00:18:54.090
<v Speaker 2>When I first saw her,</v>

372
00:18:54.091 --> 00:18:57.270
<v Speaker 2>she couldn't even speak and she was hallucinating.</v>

373
00:18:57.390 --> 00:19:00.570
<v Speaker 2>She had an auditory and visual hallucinations and I could barely communicate</v>

374
00:19:00.571 --> 00:19:01.404
<v Speaker 2>with her.</v>

375
00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:06.640
<v Speaker 2>I spent about eight months with her slowly detailing out what happened and what</v>

376
00:19:08.391 --> 00:19:12.660
<v Speaker 2>have really affected her was the fact that she couldn't understand how anyone</v>

377
00:19:12.661 --> 00:19:16.290
<v Speaker 2>could be so cruel as to bloat the way to do nothing but make her life miserable.</v>

378
00:19:16.291 --> 00:19:18.820
<v Speaker 2>And that's what broke her and she was real.</v>

379
00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.250
<v Speaker 2>It was really serious.</v>

380
00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:23.220
<v Speaker 2>And we had to sit and talk.</v>

381
00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:23.821
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

382
00:19:23.821 --> 00:19:28.050
<v Speaker 2>I tried to carry ways of then as she recovered in increasingly coherent ways</v>

383
00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:30.090
<v Speaker 2>about good and evil,</v>

384
00:19:30.091 --> 00:19:34.440
<v Speaker 2>essentially about the fact that people can be motivated to pursue nothing.</v>

385
00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:39.450
<v Speaker 2>That disruption and pain and misery and to do that consciously and with intent</v>

386
00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:43.910
<v Speaker 2>accidentally and at that as,</v>

387
00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:45.930
<v Speaker 2>as the victims of some other process,</v>

388
00:19:45.931 --> 00:19:46.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

389
00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:50.520
<v Speaker 2>but knowing full well what they're doing it and doing it because they know what</v>

390
00:19:50.521 --> 00:19:51.354
<v Speaker 2>they're doing.</v>

391
00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:54.360
<v Speaker 2>And she was a lot more mature,</v>

392
00:19:54.361 --> 00:19:57.870
<v Speaker 2>let's say at the end of that process that she was at the beginning of April,</v>

393
00:19:57.871 --> 00:19:59.470
<v Speaker 2>she paid great crisis,</v>

394
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:02.280
<v Speaker 2>which is typically the case.</v>

395
00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:05.120
<v Speaker 2>So I do understand that.</v>

396
00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:12.000
<v Speaker 2>I do understand what sort of language is necessary for use to frame these sorts</v>

397
00:20:12.001 --> 00:20:12.834
<v Speaker 2>of situations.</v>

398
00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.220
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

399
00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:18.470
<v Speaker 2>and I think the language of good and evil is the appropriate leg,</v>

400
00:20:18.471 --> 00:20:23.471
<v Speaker 2>which you aren't treating the topic we sufficient seriousness unless you need to</v>

401
00:20:24.231 --> 00:20:27.090
<v Speaker 2>use the appropriate terminology and evil.</v>

402
00:20:27.091 --> 00:20:31.620
<v Speaker 2>To me it's something like the generation of harm for the sake of the harm,</v>

403
00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:34.610
<v Speaker 2>especially to think about it as a condiment dispensing it.</v>

404
00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:37.740
<v Speaker 2>And you can understand that if you think about the side dimension,</v>

405
00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:39.320
<v Speaker 2>we're pro second freak.</v>

406
00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:41.100
<v Speaker 2>There's and this authentic to that.</v>

407
00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:46.260
<v Speaker 2>It's a dramatic or artistic statement painted in blood essentially.</v>

408
00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:50.360
<v Speaker 2>And people don't like that idea because we don't make fleet.</v>

409
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.860
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

410
00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:53.050
<v Speaker 2>we like to think that the only cause of human</v>

411
00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:58.010
<v Speaker 2>inappropriate human action,</v>

412
00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:00.560
<v Speaker 2>like people just do better.</v>

413
00:21:00.561 --> 00:21:01.231
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't do it.</v>

414
00:21:01.231 --> 00:21:02.990
<v Speaker 2>And it's like I'm afraid that just doesn't cut it.</v>

415
00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.980
<v Speaker 2>People know perfectly well what you're doing and that's exactly why you're doing</v>

416
00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:07.790
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

417
00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:09.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean there are secrets involved,</v>

418
00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:12.590
<v Speaker 2>it's involved in everything and it's just not sufficient explanation.</v>

419
00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:18.790
<v Speaker 2>So the question is where do you go when you use language is put an evil and</v>

420
00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:20.810
<v Speaker 2>that's associated with another question,</v>

421
00:21:20.811 --> 00:21:24.620
<v Speaker 2>which is something like what's the proper level of analysis?</v>

422
00:21:24.621 --> 00:21:26.810
<v Speaker 2>Because as I mentioned it to begin with,</v>

423
00:21:26.811 --> 00:21:27.840
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult to,</v>

424
00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:31.270
<v Speaker 2>to solve a problem formulating property.</v>

425
00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:34.020
<v Speaker 2>So the question here,</v>

426
00:21:34.021 --> 00:21:34.854
<v Speaker 2>I think that</v>

427
00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:38.130
<v Speaker 2>the emerging question is what could happen?</v>

428
00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:40.950
<v Speaker 2>What else do you use to approach the issue?</v>

429
00:21:40.951 --> 00:21:44.690
<v Speaker 2>And I would say there is a deeper question.</v>

430
00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:50.210
<v Speaker 2>The question of human motivations are equal except perhaps the opposite</v>

431
00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:50.901
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>

432
00:21:50.901 --> 00:21:52.520
<v Speaker 2>which is human motivation for good.</v>

433
00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:54.130
<v Speaker 2>I've heard the same thing in some sense,</v>

434
00:21:54.131 --> 00:21:54.400
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

435
00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:54.591
<v Speaker 2>It does.</v>

436
00:21:54.591 --> 00:21:55.490
<v Speaker 2>If you pause it one,</v>

437
00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:57.590
<v Speaker 2>you will also be positive.</v>

438
00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:02.180
<v Speaker 2>It's opposite it dark you incident because of like taking poison evil.</v>

439
00:22:02.181 --> 00:22:04.160
<v Speaker 2>You are the opposite of that.</v>

440
00:22:04.161 --> 00:22:05.270
<v Speaker 2>There's no way around that.</v>

441
00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:08.810
<v Speaker 2>So it's the same question and I'm going to be the question I suppose suppose of</v>

442
00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:10.180
<v Speaker 2>ethical behavior of morale,</v>

443
00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:12.260
<v Speaker 2>something like that in the question,</v>

444
00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:13.820
<v Speaker 2>the question of this nature,</v>

445
00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:16.070
<v Speaker 2>the nature of reality in the world.</v>

446
00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:18.020
<v Speaker 2>It's a deep question.</v>

447
00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:19.440
<v Speaker 2>You could say it's the deepest,</v>

448
00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:25.280
<v Speaker 2>deepest question and it requires formulation at the deepest possible level of</v>

449
00:22:25.281 --> 00:22:30.281
<v Speaker 2>analysis and it's a mystery that requires formulation at the deepest possible</v>

450
00:22:30.681 --> 00:22:31.730
<v Speaker 2>level of analysis.</v>

451
00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:35.620
<v Speaker 2>And so you accept that it's a history of you except that it's a deep just left</v>

452
00:22:35.621 --> 00:22:36.451
<v Speaker 2>one and I'm assistant.</v>

453
00:22:36.451 --> 00:22:37.460
<v Speaker 2>Didn't you ask yourself,</v>

454
00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:42.700
<v Speaker 2>where did you go to find an answer to a question that's mysterious at the</v>

455
00:22:44.391 --> 00:22:48.500
<v Speaker 2>deepest possible level of analysis and down to that at least the partners you go</v>

456
00:22:48.501 --> 00:22:49.334
<v Speaker 2>or you don't,</v>

457
00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:50.900
<v Speaker 2>you go over,</v>

458
00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:51.830
<v Speaker 2>you don't know.</v>

459
00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:54.100
<v Speaker 2>You go to that place that you don't know.</v>

460
00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:56.450
<v Speaker 2>There's actually a technical,</v>

461
00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.660
<v Speaker 2>that's a technical issue in some sense.</v>

462
00:22:59.661 --> 00:23:02.130
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things that currently only pointed out,</v>

463
00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:08.580
<v Speaker 2>and I think this is well supported by the relevant neuro psychological and neuro</v>

464
00:23:09.001 --> 00:23:10.170
<v Speaker 2>psychiatric literature,</v>

465
00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:16.370
<v Speaker 2>is that your dreams and your fantasies contain the information that you don't</v>

466
00:23:18.661 --> 00:23:19.590
<v Speaker 2>yet know.</v>

467
00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:21.213
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

468
00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:24.140
<v Speaker 2>that's not an easy thing to understand that because you might think,</v>

469
00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:25.280
<v Speaker 2>let's say you have to three,</v>

470
00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:28.170
<v Speaker 2>you figure out what the dream means.</v>

471
00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:29.550
<v Speaker 2>Then there's a mystery,</v>

472
00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:30.413
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

473
00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:31.171
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

474
00:23:31.171 --> 00:23:32.440
<v Speaker 2>if you didn't know what to treat them,</v>

475
00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:34.160
<v Speaker 2>how the hell did you dream it?</v>

476
00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:35.210
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

477
00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:36.840
<v Speaker 2>Mean because you drunk,</v>

478
00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:38.640
<v Speaker 2>you don't understand it.</v>

479
00:23:38.641 --> 00:23:39.660
<v Speaker 2>So how does that work?</v>

480
00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:41.980
<v Speaker 2>Because how can you think of something that you don't understand?</v>

481
00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:43.333
<v Speaker 2>Part of the army,</v>

482
00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:45.710
<v Speaker 2>you're not exactly a unity.</v>

483
00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:48.860
<v Speaker 2>There's parts of you that know things that other parts of you don't know.</v>

484
00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:52.730
<v Speaker 2>Or there's parts of you that know things in ways that the part of you that parks</v>

485
00:23:52.731 --> 00:23:54.230
<v Speaker 2>can understand that.</v>

486
00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:57.650
<v Speaker 2>And there's things that you act out that are too complicated for you to</v>

487
00:23:57.651 --> 00:23:59.240
<v Speaker 2>represent for it to articulate.</v>

488
00:23:59.241 --> 00:24:02.540
<v Speaker 2>And so there's lots of things that were,</v>

489
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:05.520
<v Speaker 2>that you don't understand that our adolescent foreman,</v>

490
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:06.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

491
00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:06.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

492
00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:07.670
<v Speaker 2>you don't know how you breathe,</v>

493
00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:09.050
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what in your heart works.</v>

494
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:11.150
<v Speaker 2>It's not support how your heart beats.</v>

495
00:24:11.151 --> 00:24:12.740
<v Speaker 2>You don't have voluntary control over that.</v>

496
00:24:12.741 --> 00:24:17.660
<v Speaker 2>So it's not that surprising in some sense that your mind could produce contents</v>

497
00:24:17.661 --> 00:24:19.640
<v Speaker 2>that transcend your articulate.</v>

498
00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:22.100
<v Speaker 2>No idea was that,</v>

499
00:24:22.101 --> 00:24:25.060
<v Speaker 2>that's what dreams did that with what dreams were doing,</v>

500
00:24:25.061 --> 00:24:29.840
<v Speaker 2>ascension was you haven't worldview and that worldview was only partial</v>

501
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.801
<v Speaker 2>obviously,</v>

502
00:24:30.801 --> 00:24:31.510
<v Speaker 2>because what the hell,</v>

503
00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:32.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

504
00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:33.080
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

505
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.321
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

506
00:24:33.321 --> 00:24:36.140
<v Speaker 2>you're limited in your knowledge and you're articulate and you're,</v>

507
00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:37.010
<v Speaker 2>and you're,</v>

508
00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:37.370
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

509
00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:37.890
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

510
00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:38.760
<v Speaker 2>you're logical.</v>

511
00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:39.471
<v Speaker 2>It integrated,</v>

512
00:24:39.471 --> 00:24:41.870
<v Speaker 2>articulate knowledge as the limited domain.</v>

513
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:45.840
<v Speaker 2>And there's lots of things that exist outside that made those,</v>

514
00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:46.191
<v Speaker 2>it takes,</v>

515
00:24:46.191 --> 00:24:48.440
<v Speaker 2>you don't understand or errors that you've made.</v>

516
00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:52.640
<v Speaker 2>And you also have to cope with them half to start provisionally understanding</v>

517
00:24:52.641 --> 00:24:52.911
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

518
00:24:52.911 --> 00:24:56.630
<v Speaker 2>Because not only do you have to understand what you understand and most will</v>

519
00:24:56.631 --> 00:24:59.510
<v Speaker 2>have to come to understand what you don't yet understand.</v>

520
00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:00.381
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

521
00:25:00.381 --> 00:25:03.290
<v Speaker 2>And that's how you learn and it's August how that happens.</v>

522
00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:08.600
<v Speaker 2>And Hume's idea was that this is an elaboration I came to some degrees while you</v>

523
00:25:08.601 --> 00:25:13.140
<v Speaker 2>learned in part by acting and then you learn in part by representing that action</v>

524
00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:16.030
<v Speaker 2>and you learn by analyzing this representation.</v>

525
00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:21.440
<v Speaker 2>And I would say yoga is not particularly well regardless in most cases by</v>

526
00:25:21.441 --> 00:25:22.010
<v Speaker 2>modern,</v>

527
00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:25.700
<v Speaker 2>more biologically oriented psychologists and medical practitioners.</v>

528
00:25:25.701 --> 00:25:28.730
<v Speaker 2>But that's generally because they don't understand what the hell he was talking</v>

529
00:25:28.731 --> 00:25:29.510
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

530
00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:33.260
<v Speaker 2>So the reason is there's good news,</v>

531
00:25:33.261 --> 00:25:34.490
<v Speaker 2>psychiatric evidence now,</v>

532
00:25:34.491 --> 00:25:37.640
<v Speaker 2>psychological evidence that that's actually how the brain functions.</v>

533
00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:40.500
<v Speaker 2>So there is a neuropsychologist,</v>

534
00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:44.690
<v Speaker 2>they'll Conan Goldberg who was a student of another neuropsychologist named</v>

535
00:25:44.691 --> 00:25:45.650
<v Speaker 2>Alexander Luria,</v>

536
00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:46.490
<v Speaker 2>who's a Russian,</v>

537
00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:51.490
<v Speaker 2>probably the grade school psychologist of the 20th century is he basically laid</v>

538
00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:54.310
<v Speaker 2>the ground water.</v>

539
00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:58.760
<v Speaker 2>My understanding of the way the brain functions and his students discovered</v>

540
00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:03.790
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily fundamental neurophysiological fact spoke to Brady's heavy</v>

541
00:26:03.921 --> 00:26:05.680
<v Speaker 2>hitter and his student help.</v>

542
00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:09.440
<v Speaker 2>Conan Bloomberg was very interested in why we have two hemispheres.</v>

543
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:12.020
<v Speaker 2>It's not obvious what have to have a seriously.</v>

544
00:26:12.021 --> 00:26:15.890
<v Speaker 2>It's as as we have two brains and there is evidence.</v>

545
00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:17.820
<v Speaker 2>There was surgery that was government,</v>

546
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:22.430
<v Speaker 2>not so much anymore but years ago when people had intractable epilepsy that</v>

547
00:26:22.431 --> 00:26:24.980
<v Speaker 2>caused the two hemispheres stuff,</v>

548
00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:26.960
<v Speaker 2>Corpus Callosum,</v>

549
00:26:26.961 --> 00:26:28.220
<v Speaker 2>which is the fat tissue,</v>

550
00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:32.260
<v Speaker 2>proper hemispheres and collecting,</v>

551
00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:33.263
<v Speaker 2>discovered</v>

552
00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:39.580
<v Speaker 2>conscious and so it's actually the case in,</v>

553
00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:40.463
<v Speaker 2>in you,</v>

554
00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:45.450
<v Speaker 2>in your feed you have to consciousness is that someone separate that you'd be</v>

555
00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:49.980
<v Speaker 2>the case that each have had various functions and what that implies is that you</v>

556
00:26:49.981 --> 00:26:54.540
<v Speaker 2>need to look at the world in two ways and that implies maybe that the world is,</v>

557
00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:59.770
<v Speaker 2>is in some sense fundamentally divisible into two because otherwise why would</v>

558
00:26:59.971 --> 00:27:04.500
<v Speaker 2>have you evolved the brain then we'd look at it in two ways since you evolve to</v>

559
00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:09.030
<v Speaker 2>actively avoid hitting the world and it's not just you because animals have two</v>

560
00:27:09.031 --> 00:27:14.031
<v Speaker 2>hemispheres as well as a very fundamental division and what Goldberg's suggested</v>

561
00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:20.210
<v Speaker 2>was that your left hemisphere of a specialized for operation in places that you</v>

562
00:27:21.091 --> 00:27:26.070
<v Speaker 2>understand in your right hemisphere was specialized for operation in places that</v>

563
00:27:26.071 --> 00:27:27.180
<v Speaker 2>you don't understand,</v>

564
00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:28.010
<v Speaker 2>find.</v>

565
00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:30.990
<v Speaker 2>You can think about that if you want to think about it from a more biological</v>

566
00:27:30.991 --> 00:27:31.591
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>

567
00:27:31.591 --> 00:27:34.140
<v Speaker 2>You could say that you have one system,</v>

568
00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:38.910
<v Speaker 2>say psychological system that orients you unexplored territory,</v>

569
00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:43.470
<v Speaker 2>which is where your things are familiar and where you can predict what's going</v>

570
00:27:43.471 --> 00:27:43.981
<v Speaker 2>to happen,</v>

571
00:27:43.981 --> 00:27:47.880
<v Speaker 2>where what you want to happen is happening because that's the best definition of</v>

572
00:27:47.881 --> 00:27:48.810
<v Speaker 2>being comfortable,</v>

573
00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:49.470
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

574
00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:50.130
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

575
00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:55.130
<v Speaker 2>you know where you are when you act and what you want to have happen happens.</v>

576
00:27:55.530 --> 00:28:00.530
<v Speaker 2>That's a place that's home that's explored territory and what an unexplored</v>

577
00:28:00.721 --> 00:28:01.471
<v Speaker 2>territory is.</v>

578
00:28:01.471 --> 00:28:02.160
<v Speaker 2>The space,</v>

579
00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.270
<v Speaker 2>the on account fire,</v>

580
00:28:03.271 --> 00:28:06.240
<v Speaker 2>let's say the darkness of the night in the jungle,</v>

581
00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:09.590
<v Speaker 2>but also that place where things that you didn't know what to expect or want</v>

582
00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.380
<v Speaker 2>happened and he's the best.</v>

583
00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:14.190
<v Speaker 2>So that's what the world is composed of,</v>

584
00:28:14.191 --> 00:28:15.790
<v Speaker 2>the substance of the world have experienced.</v>

585
00:28:15.791 --> 00:28:19.500
<v Speaker 2>It's all those things that you want to have happen that you're familiar with and</v>

586
00:28:19.501 --> 00:28:21.480
<v Speaker 2>all those things that go bump in the night.</v>

587
00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:25.720
<v Speaker 2>All those things that rise up out of the unknown to disrupt your,</v>

588
00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:27.920
<v Speaker 2>the best laid plans of mice,</v>

589
00:28:27.921 --> 00:28:28.710
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>

590
00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:32.490
<v Speaker 2>And so you do have these two separate neurological systems in the way.</v>

591
00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:33.740
<v Speaker 2>And so that was outlined.</v>

592
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:37.010
<v Speaker 2>Oil foaming Goldberg quite nicely and uh,</v>

593
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:41.190
<v Speaker 2>it's been verified by neurosis neuropsychiatric status.</v>

594
00:28:41.191 --> 00:28:42.030
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

595
00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:46.290
<v Speaker 2>by MDGs Rep Shaundra who's a neurologist at Ucla.</v>

596
00:28:46.291 --> 00:28:47.580
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you a story about that,</v>

597
00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:48.810
<v Speaker 2>but he discovered,</v>

598
00:28:48.811 --> 00:28:50.130
<v Speaker 2>cause it's pretty damn amazing.</v>

599
00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:53.780
<v Speaker 2>So there's this neurological condition called neglect.</v>

600
00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:55.040
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

601
00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:56.120
<v Speaker 2>really strange condition.</v>

602
00:28:56.121 --> 00:28:57.670
<v Speaker 2>It's virtually in comprehensible.</v>

603
00:28:58.210 --> 00:29:02.040
<v Speaker 2>And what happens if you have eucalyptus that you have a stroke and you're right,</v>

604
00:29:02.041 --> 00:29:06.730
<v Speaker 2>the bridle up the right priority area of your right hemisphere has,</v>

605
00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:07.560
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

606
00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:09.500
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't happen if it's left hemispheres.</v>

607
00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:15.280
<v Speaker 2>And what happens if you have that stroke is you lose the logic side of your</v>

608
00:29:15.331 --> 00:29:16.164
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

609
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:20.070
<v Speaker 2>And the loss is extremely interesting that the first thing is you lose motor</v>

610
00:29:20.071 --> 00:29:21.600
<v Speaker 2>control so you can't move it.</v>

611
00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:23.790
<v Speaker 2>But that's sort of the beginning of it.</v>

612
00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:27.030
<v Speaker 2>You lose your ability to conceptualize it.</v>

613
00:29:27.031 --> 00:29:30.750
<v Speaker 2>The fact that you had the left side of your body and more,</v>

614
00:29:30.751 --> 00:29:33.430
<v Speaker 2>you lose the ability to conceive of land.</v>

615
00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:35.400
<v Speaker 2>And we don't know how this happens.</v>

616
00:29:35.401 --> 00:29:36.870
<v Speaker 2>I think it must be something like,</v>

617
00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:38.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

618
00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:41.010
<v Speaker 2>if I stand here and look out at all,</v>

619
00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:44.260
<v Speaker 2>I can see that people right in front of me quite clearly,</v>

620
00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:46.420
<v Speaker 2>and then the people to my right and left,</v>

621
00:29:46.421 --> 00:29:47.750
<v Speaker 2>as long as I keep my eyes fixed,</v>

622
00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:48.790
<v Speaker 2>it's right in front of me.</v>

623
00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:49.990
<v Speaker 2>They're quite blurry.</v>

624
00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:51.280
<v Speaker 2>I can't see their faces,</v>

625
00:29:51.281 --> 00:29:52.390
<v Speaker 2>although I know there people.</v>

626
00:29:52.391 --> 00:29:56.260
<v Speaker 2>And then by this are out at the periphery of my visual system.</v>

627
00:29:56.261 --> 00:29:58.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't even have color vision anymore.</v>

628
00:29:58.001 --> 00:30:03.001
<v Speaker 2>Even white tape it door cause the tests to show that and then past that which is</v>

629
00:30:03.971 --> 00:30:04.804
<v Speaker 2>behind me.</v>

630
00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:05.853
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing,</v>

631
00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:07.660
<v Speaker 2>it's not black.</v>

632
00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:08.860
<v Speaker 2>It's not an amputee,</v>

633
00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:11.010
<v Speaker 2>it's just not there.</v>

634
00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:11.883
<v Speaker 2>It's not even,</v>

635
00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:12.930
<v Speaker 2>it's not even gone.</v>

636
00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:13.241
<v Speaker 2>Fair.</v>

637
00:30:13.241 --> 00:30:14.470
<v Speaker 2>It just doesn't exist.</v>

638
00:30:14.471 --> 00:30:19.180
<v Speaker 2>And what seems to happen when people who have neglect that moves around a three</v>

639
00:30:19.181 --> 00:30:21.220
<v Speaker 2>quarters of that thing instead of half.</v>

640
00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:24.070
<v Speaker 2>Now that's a guess because we really don't know.</v>

641
00:30:24.071 --> 00:30:26.980
<v Speaker 2>But if you get people who they'd like to draw a clock,</v>

642
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.660
<v Speaker 2>it will put all the numbers in one half.</v>

643
00:30:28.661 --> 00:30:30.100
<v Speaker 2>And if you give them a plate full of food,</v>

644
00:30:30.101 --> 00:30:32.770
<v Speaker 2>they'll only eat the food off the right side of the plate.</v>

645
00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:33.940
<v Speaker 2>And if you turn the plate,</v>

646
00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:35.260
<v Speaker 2>they'll eat half of what's left.</v>

647
00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:37.980
<v Speaker 2>And then even more strangely now,</v>

648
00:30:37.981 --> 00:30:42.340
<v Speaker 2>I meant they notice that they have a left heart and it really upsets them.</v>

649
00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:45.760
<v Speaker 2>So they have it and they noticed they have a left arm and they'll try to,</v>

650
00:30:45.761 --> 00:30:47.290
<v Speaker 2>it will be horrified by it.</v>

651
00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:48.940
<v Speaker 2>They'll think in someone else's,</v>

652
00:30:48.941 --> 00:30:52.320
<v Speaker 2>they'll take maybe someone that they know or that maybe the nurses left the body</v>

653
00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:55.840
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes they'll even try to throw it out with bed.</v>

654
00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:59.770
<v Speaker 2>And so and so they don't seem to buy.</v>

655
00:30:59.771 --> 00:31:00.920
<v Speaker 2>And here's the other thing,</v>

656
00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:04.840
<v Speaker 2>strange is they're not upset about the fact that they're half paralyzed as</v>

657
00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:07.430
<v Speaker 2>because they actually don't know that they're half parallax.</v>

658
00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:08.590
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that,</v>

659
00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:12.070
<v Speaker 2>the part of the brain that would alert them to the fact that they're half</v>

660
00:31:12.071 --> 00:31:14.050
<v Speaker 2>paralyzed is being destroyed by the stroke.</v>

661
00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:15.510
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

662
00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:16.091
<v Speaker 2>it's there,</v>

663
00:31:16.091 --> 00:31:17.180
<v Speaker 2>don't have sex at all.</v>

664
00:31:17.181 --> 00:31:20.290
<v Speaker 2>Like that part that would make them upset because you should be upset if you</v>

665
00:31:20.291 --> 00:31:21.420
<v Speaker 2>lose half your voice.</v>

666
00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:23.140
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's very upsetting.</v>

667
00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:25.330
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that you get upset is your,</v>

668
00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:30.420
<v Speaker 2>it alerts you to the importance of the loss and so mad that he didn't care a</v>

669
00:31:32.051 --> 00:31:32.500
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>

670
00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:34.390
<v Speaker 2>Well then would you notice and answered as well?</v>

671
00:31:34.391 --> 00:31:35.530
<v Speaker 2>Apparently not.</v>

672
00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:40.950
<v Speaker 2>And so what grandma Sean was experimented with the balance,</v>

673
00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:44.860
<v Speaker 2>literally the balance of people who have neglected.</v>

674
00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:50.080
<v Speaker 2>He did this weird little experiments that you do to test people's vestibular</v>

675
00:31:50.081 --> 00:31:50.471
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>

676
00:31:50.471 --> 00:31:52.650
<v Speaker 2>which enables them to stay on break felons,</v>

677
00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:53.493
<v Speaker 2>consultant.</v>

678
00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:56.170
<v Speaker 2>If you pour cold water in someone's ear,</v>

679
00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:57.460
<v Speaker 2>then it upstairs,</v>

680
00:31:57.461 --> 00:32:00.940
<v Speaker 2>I have sense of their buildings because your ears are intensely involved in your</v>

681
00:32:00.941 --> 00:32:04.710
<v Speaker 2>balance and your eyes are move back and forth and it destabilizes the seas.</v>

682
00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:10.140
<v Speaker 2>And so around the Shaundra was testing his neglect cases for their,</v>

683
00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:11.681
<v Speaker 2>for their,</v>

684
00:32:11.681 --> 00:32:12.514
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

685
00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:15.190
<v Speaker 2>for their testicular function using cold water.</v>

686
00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:19.750
<v Speaker 2>A number of them woke up and realized that they were paralyzed.</v>

687
00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:22.610
<v Speaker 2>And his idea was essentially that the shock,</v>

688
00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:25.900
<v Speaker 2>eventually the shock of the cold water was enough to,</v>

689
00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:28.030
<v Speaker 2>to increase,</v>

690
00:32:28.031 --> 00:32:32.380
<v Speaker 2>say emotional functioning enough to reactivate the damage and efforts in the</v>

691
00:32:32.381 --> 00:32:36.300
<v Speaker 2>right hemisphere to wake them up enough to notice that have to go into</v>

692
00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:41.310
<v Speaker 2>businesses and to produce a catastrophic emotional response when people realize</v>

693
00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:42.623
<v Speaker 2>what happened.</v>

694
00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:43.863
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

695
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.210
<v Speaker 2>so if you call the attention of someone with neglect,</v>

696
00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:48.420
<v Speaker 2>the left hand and you say,</v>

697
00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:50.020
<v Speaker 2>you haven't left handed there,</v>

698
00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:50.861
<v Speaker 2>and we said,</v>

699
00:32:50.861 --> 00:32:51.501
<v Speaker 2>can you move it?</v>

700
00:32:51.501 --> 00:32:51.951
<v Speaker 2>And they'll say,</v>

701
00:32:51.951 --> 00:32:52.170
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

702
00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:53.003
<v Speaker 2>never mind.</v>

703
00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:56.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel like my arthritis is point this morning.</v>

704
00:32:56.530 --> 00:32:57.081
<v Speaker 2>It hurts me.</v>

705
00:32:57.081 --> 00:32:59.840
<v Speaker 2>They come up with some rationalization for why they can't move it,</v>

706
00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:01.520
<v Speaker 2>but they're not upset.</v>

707
00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:03.460
<v Speaker 2>So robichon none when you're getting your ears.</v>

708
00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:07.160
<v Speaker 2>And then they wake up and they haven't had a strong emotional response to the</v>

709
00:33:07.161 --> 00:33:09.020
<v Speaker 2>loss of the live side of your body.</v>

710
00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:12.960
<v Speaker 2>But then 20 minutes later they snap out of it and then they forget they lost the</v>

711
00:33:12.961 --> 00:33:13.400
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>

712
00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:16.190
<v Speaker 2>They go right back to their old way of thinking.</v>

713
00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:16.671
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

714
00:33:16.671 --> 00:33:20.180
<v Speaker 2>what's so interesting about this and how it's related to whatever he told you is</v>

715
00:33:20.181 --> 00:33:20.710
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

716
00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:21.010
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

717
00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:24.050
<v Speaker 2>their left hemisphere had already built a blog with their body,</v>

718
00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:26.600
<v Speaker 2>and you know you have a model of your body.</v>

719
00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:28.260
<v Speaker 2>It's really [inaudible].</v>

720
00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:31.370
<v Speaker 2>You can tell that magic if you break a tooth,</v>

721
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:35.450
<v Speaker 2>what happens if you break your tooth is your tongue grooves absolutely insane,</v>

722
00:33:35.451 --> 00:33:35.810
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

723
00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:36.800
<v Speaker 2>Next three months,</v>

724
00:33:36.801 --> 00:33:40.190
<v Speaker 2>all of your tongue does is poke around in there.</v>

725
00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:43.520
<v Speaker 2>Pick her up exactly the contours of your mouth,</v>

726
00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:46.610
<v Speaker 2>and maybe it takes you three months to update that too.</v>

727
00:33:46.611 --> 00:33:49.310
<v Speaker 2>And you don't feel like you're both is a stranger.</v>

728
00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:51.970
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is what you should let him know.</v>

729
00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:53.300
<v Speaker 2>It's in your outrage.</v>

730
00:33:53.650 --> 00:33:55.160
<v Speaker 2>Like entire,</v>

731
00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:58.340
<v Speaker 2>you're unbelievably are not sensitive.</v>

732
00:33:58.341 --> 00:34:01.400
<v Speaker 2>And so because when you put things in there and you have to eat,</v>

733
00:34:01.690 --> 00:34:05.870
<v Speaker 2>and so you have the intelligence of what's you and what isn't for you.</v>

734
00:34:05.871 --> 00:34:06.860
<v Speaker 2>Choose your tongue.</v>

735
00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:07.071
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

736
00:34:07.071 --> 00:34:07.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

737
00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:10.070
<v Speaker 2>it's very important to have that map that you see.</v>

738
00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:13.970
<v Speaker 2>You see with your experience with having a damage tooth.</v>

739
00:34:13.971 --> 00:34:17.690
<v Speaker 2>You see just how much work it takes to even do a little tiny bit of remapping,</v>

740
00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:18.140
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

741
00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:20.090
<v Speaker 2>It's like three months of of Tom,</v>

742
00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:23.480
<v Speaker 2>the effort to update your will of your mouth.</v>

743
00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:26.870
<v Speaker 2>Imagine how much effort it would lucky we'll take to update your model of your</v>

744
00:34:26.871 --> 00:34:28.430
<v Speaker 2>body if you've lost half of it,</v>

745
00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:29.510
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

746
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:30.021
<v Speaker 2>So that's it.</v>

747
00:34:30.021 --> 00:34:31.880
<v Speaker 2>So your left hemisphere count do that.</v>

748
00:34:31.881 --> 00:34:36.110
<v Speaker 2>It just keeps on processing your body with the old model.</v>

749
00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:38.390
<v Speaker 2>And since the right hemispheres damaged,</v>

750
00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:41.480
<v Speaker 2>there isn't any emotion associated with the loss.</v>

751
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:46.220
<v Speaker 2>And so the left hemisphere just keeps on grinding away on its own local one.</v>

752
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:48.250
<v Speaker 2>And that happens to us a lot.</v>

753
00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:52.610
<v Speaker 2>But that's sort of how we think is that we have these partial models of reality</v>

754
00:34:52.611 --> 00:34:55.550
<v Speaker 2>that more or less work and were really stubborn about.</v>

755
00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:59.400
<v Speaker 2>And we don't want them to disappear because they take a bloody modern word to,</v>

756
00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:01.100
<v Speaker 2>to formulate.</v>

757
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:02.590
<v Speaker 2>And if we're forced to lose the,</v>

758
00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:04.220
<v Speaker 2>it tends to be catastrophic.</v>

759
00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:06.410
<v Speaker 2>And so an example that might be,</v>

760
00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:07.521
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

761
00:35:07.521 --> 00:35:12.200
<v Speaker 2>let's say you put a whole bunch of effort into a monogamous monogamous</v>

762
00:35:12.201 --> 00:35:15.980
<v Speaker 2>relationship and so as she's lasted 10 years and you think,</v>

763
00:35:15.981 --> 00:35:17.150
<v Speaker 2>well what's the effort?</v>

764
00:35:17.151 --> 00:35:18.670
<v Speaker 2>Okay well the first PBS,</v>

765
00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:22.610
<v Speaker 2>you've gone a lot of places with this person who had done a lot of things with</v>

766
00:35:22.611 --> 00:35:26.120
<v Speaker 2>them and you have a story about that and the stories based on your understanding</v>

767
00:35:26.121 --> 00:35:31.121
<v Speaker 2>of that person and the implication of that understanding for your understanding</v>

768
00:35:31.191 --> 00:35:32.024
<v Speaker 2>of you.</v>

769
00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:33.650
<v Speaker 2>So you know you might be equal.</v>

770
00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:34.730
<v Speaker 2>I took mine,</v>

771
00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:38.040
<v Speaker 2>my wife or husband to Hawaii and we</v>

772
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:42.960
<v Speaker 3>have a nice time and you have that whole memory and you have hundreds of</v>

773
00:35:42.961 --> 00:35:44.370
<v Speaker 3>memories like that whole sequence,</v>

774
00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:48.390
<v Speaker 3>the next your story about who you are and very hard in the past.</v>

775
00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:49.770
<v Speaker 3>And then you have a story like that,</v>

776
00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:54.510
<v Speaker 3>who you are and what maybe we now and then give a story like that about your</v>

777
00:35:54.511 --> 00:35:55.320
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>

778
00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:58.830
<v Speaker 3>And then you find out what the partners can been having sequential affairs for</v>

779
00:35:58.831 --> 00:36:00.240
<v Speaker 3>the last 15 years.</v>

780
00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:01.201
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

781
00:36:01.201 --> 00:36:02.730
<v Speaker 3>well what happens?</v>

782
00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:03.601
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

783
00:36:03.601 --> 00:36:05.270
<v Speaker 3>your model's not really delicate.</v>

784
00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:06.871
<v Speaker 3>And then you think,</v>

785
00:36:06.871 --> 00:36:06.961
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

786
00:36:06.961 --> 00:36:08.250
<v Speaker 3>what does that mean exactly?</v>

787
00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:09.031
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

788
00:36:09.031 --> 00:36:13.140
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't just mean that you don't know who your partner is,</v>

789
00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:18.680
<v Speaker 3>although it really means that it also means everything is not about your past is</v>

790
00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:19.823
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>

791
00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:22.830
<v Speaker 3>All those memories of everything that happened,</v>

792
00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:25.080
<v Speaker 3>those aren't accurate.</v>

793
00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:28.410
<v Speaker 3>And so when something like that happens in deep betrayal,</v>

794
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:31.740
<v Speaker 3>this is why Dante put betrayers in the lowest level of hell,</v>

795
00:36:31.741 --> 00:36:32.574
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

796
00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:37.740
<v Speaker 3>are besides safety itself in case denies that the betrayers and because it blows</v>

797
00:36:38.131 --> 00:36:41.430
<v Speaker 3>out your model of the past and the presence of the teacher,</v>

798
00:36:41.431 --> 00:36:43.500
<v Speaker 3>you told him where your are,</v>

799
00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:46.740
<v Speaker 3>we don't know where you were and you don't know where you're going.</v>

800
00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:48.080
<v Speaker 3>And it's worse than that.</v>

801
00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:52.500
<v Speaker 3>That because you also don't know who you are anymore because you are obviously</v>

802
00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:57.350
<v Speaker 3>someone who just wasn't that awake and you were with someone.</v>

803
00:36:57.770 --> 00:37:00.330
<v Speaker 3>Justin wasn't who you thought they were.</v>

804
00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:04.890
<v Speaker 3>And so it's no wonder you'd be resistant to information like that.</v>

805
00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:06.061
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

806
00:37:06.061 --> 00:37:10.880
<v Speaker 3>It's like who the hell wants to have a global theory of that magnitude disprove</v>

807
00:37:10.881 --> 00:37:11.940
<v Speaker 3>dealt a blow?</v>

808
00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:16.650
<v Speaker 3>It just leaves you wide open and exposed to the world so we can protect your</v>

809
00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:18.900
<v Speaker 3>theories as much as you possibly can.</v>

810
00:37:18.901 --> 00:37:23.400
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to overthrow them because of some casual disapprove or to stick</v>

811
00:37:23.401 --> 00:37:24.234
<v Speaker 3>to them.</v>

812
00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:24.481
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

813
00:37:24.481 --> 00:37:27.630
<v Speaker 3>psychologists talk about that as a confirmation bias.</v>

814
00:37:27.631 --> 00:37:29.530
<v Speaker 3>Let's say I think about it as a cognitive.</v>

815
00:37:29.531 --> 00:37:30.364
<v Speaker 3>They are,</v>

816
00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:31.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

817
00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:34.050
<v Speaker 3>bemoan the fact that people are very stubborn about giving up their</v>

818
00:37:34.051 --> 00:37:34.920
<v Speaker 3>presuppositions,</v>

819
00:37:34.921 --> 00:37:36.270
<v Speaker 3>but it's no bloody wonder.</v>

820
00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:36.531
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

821
00:37:36.531 --> 00:37:37.080
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

822
00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:37.913
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

823
00:37:38.010 --> 00:37:40.740
<v Speaker 3>you put a lot of afternoon to that formulation of the world.</v>

824
00:37:40.741 --> 00:37:42.780
<v Speaker 3>It's not just a representation,</v>

825
00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:43.501
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

826
00:37:43.501 --> 00:37:45.870
<v Speaker 3>It's the way we live in the world.</v>

827
00:37:45.871 --> 00:37:47.040
<v Speaker 3>And so if you give that up,</v>

828
00:37:47.041 --> 00:37:48.990
<v Speaker 3>well then what the hell are you supposed to do?</v>

829
00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:49.711
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

830
00:37:49.711 --> 00:37:51.060
<v Speaker 3>You're supposed to be enraged.</v>

831
00:37:51.061 --> 00:37:52.030
<v Speaker 3>He's supposed to have a fit,</v>

832
00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:53.310
<v Speaker 3>is supposed to become bourbon.</v>

833
00:37:53.311 --> 00:37:53.491
<v Speaker 3>Russ,</v>

834
00:37:53.491 --> 00:37:55.800
<v Speaker 3>are you supposed to collapse into depression?</v>

835
00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:58.230
<v Speaker 3>He's supposed to be like infinitely cynical.</v>

836
00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:01.740
<v Speaker 3>Are you supposed to never happen to have a relationship that your life are you</v>

837
00:38:01.741 --> 00:38:05.730
<v Speaker 3>supposed to be half complete contempt for yourself for being so naive and blind</v>

838
00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:09.360
<v Speaker 3>or you're supposed to hate humanity because it contains the capacity for that</v>

839
00:38:09.361 --> 00:38:10.500
<v Speaker 3>kind of betrayal.</v>

840
00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:12.060
<v Speaker 3>It's like you don't know.</v>

841
00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:16.470
<v Speaker 3>All of those things are true all at one civil paisley and that's the little</v>

842
00:38:16.471 --> 00:38:17.970
<v Speaker 3>space that you occupy,</v>

843
00:38:17.971 --> 00:38:18.690
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

844
00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:20.880
<v Speaker 3>That's the mythical underworld essentially.</v>

845
00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:24.220
<v Speaker 3>That's a place you go when your dreams and hopes died.</v>

846
00:38:24.450 --> 00:38:26.550
<v Speaker 3>Everyone goes there from time to time.</v>

847
00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:29.040
<v Speaker 3>Lots of people go there and never come out.</v>

848
00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:30.773
<v Speaker 3>So what did,</v>

849
00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:32.220
<v Speaker 3>what happens when you,</v>

850
00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:34.860
<v Speaker 3>what happens in a situation like that?</v>

851
00:38:34.861 --> 00:38:38.770
<v Speaker 3>What happens when you're faced by something that you really radically don't</v>

852
00:38:38.771 --> 00:38:39.604
<v Speaker 3>understand?</v>

853
00:38:39.970 --> 00:38:43.540
<v Speaker 3>Partly what happens is you start fantasizing about who you can partner.</v>

854
00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:48.910
<v Speaker 3>Was it the it's you don't need to be pumped into all sorts of dramatic theories</v>

855
00:38:48.911 --> 00:38:50.330
<v Speaker 3>about what they might really be.</v>

856
00:38:50.331 --> 00:38:51.164
<v Speaker 3>Number two,</v>

857
00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:51.810
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

858
00:38:51.810 --> 00:38:52.280
<v Speaker 3>There's pair,</v>

859
00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:54.940
<v Speaker 3>you don't head down them and cynicism,</v>

860
00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:56.260
<v Speaker 3>bitterness and all of that,</v>

861
00:38:56.261 --> 00:39:00.110
<v Speaker 3>but that's your right hemisphere trying to make a new picture of reality and</v>

862
00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:04.180
<v Speaker 3>generating these fantasies kind of come up with an account that makes sense of</v>

863
00:39:04.181 --> 00:39:05.014
<v Speaker 3>what happened.</v>

864
00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:09.670
<v Speaker 3>And that's really the way that we help to cope with radically new information.</v>

865
00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:10.720
<v Speaker 3>Something like that.</v>

866
00:39:10.770 --> 00:39:12.610
<v Speaker 3>Except it's even more complicated.</v>

867
00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:16.690
<v Speaker 3>And I'm telling you all this because I want to specify how it is,</v>

868
00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:20.290
<v Speaker 3>what I want to specify,</v>

869
00:39:20.530 --> 00:39:24.910
<v Speaker 3>why it's necessary to go to the deepest level of analysis and to try to</v>

870
00:39:24.911 --> 00:39:26.170
<v Speaker 3>understand what's there.</v>

871
00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:28.690
<v Speaker 3>The more mysterious something is,</v>

872
00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:33.700
<v Speaker 3>the more you have to use your imagination in some sense to represent it because</v>

873
00:39:33.701 --> 00:39:34.660
<v Speaker 3>you don't know what to do.</v>

874
00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:38.350
<v Speaker 3>Fancy socks and hypothesize about you have to dream about,</v>

875
00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:39.773
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

876
00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:41.390
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

877
00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:42.480
<v Speaker 3>you'll kind of walk this office.</v>

878
00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:43.333
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

879
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:44.823
<v Speaker 1>dreams</v>

880
00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:48.690
<v Speaker 3>concentrated on what we ignore.</v>

881
00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:52.400
<v Speaker 3>So the part of your brain tells you what's a lot.</v>

882
00:39:52.401 --> 00:39:54.690
<v Speaker 3>Then he's on things in the normal world,</v>

883
00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:58.710
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't work perfectly because what you know doesn't work perfectly.</v>

884
00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:02.670
<v Speaker 3>And so you started recruiting errors along the way and then your right</v>

885
00:40:02.671 --> 00:40:04.050
<v Speaker 3>hemisphere collects those areas.</v>

886
00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:06.170
<v Speaker 3>It starts to try and figure out what to do about them.</v>

887
00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:09.180
<v Speaker 3>If you wake people up under CP and the dreaming,</v>

888
00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:10.830
<v Speaker 3>the most common emotion,</v>

889
00:40:10.831 --> 00:40:15.660
<v Speaker 3>they relate his anxiety and because at night what you do is try to reconfigure</v>

890
00:40:15.661 --> 00:40:19.110
<v Speaker 3>what you know to take into account what you don't know and that's an anxiety</v>

891
00:40:19.111 --> 00:40:23.640
<v Speaker 3>provoking process and use notion with regards to dream analysis.</v>

892
00:40:23.641 --> 00:40:25.920
<v Speaker 3>And that was the same story to some degree was that you could,</v>

893
00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:29.910
<v Speaker 3>if people were facing an attractable mystery and they didn't know how to see.</v>

894
00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:30.631
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

895
00:40:30.631 --> 00:40:31.890
<v Speaker 3>then you come and see me,</v>

896
00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:34.500
<v Speaker 3>you're not happy in your job that you don't want to give it up because of the</v>

897
00:40:34.501 --> 00:40:38.730
<v Speaker 3>security or like it's complicated situation and you can't see any way forward.</v>

898
00:40:39.090 --> 00:40:39.781
<v Speaker 3>Then I might say,</v>

899
00:40:39.781 --> 00:40:41.340
<v Speaker 3>well do you dream?</v>

900
00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:43.050
<v Speaker 3>And if you said yes,</v>

901
00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:46.860
<v Speaker 3>some people dream a lot and right now and we might take a look at dreams to see</v>

902
00:40:46.861 --> 00:40:51.840
<v Speaker 3>if he could catch the new story that's emerging underneath your knowledge about</v>

903
00:40:51.841 --> 00:40:53.250
<v Speaker 3>where it is that you might go.</v>

904
00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:54.300
<v Speaker 3>And that can be very,</v>

905
00:40:54.301 --> 00:40:59.280
<v Speaker 3>very illuminating and people differ in the complexity and sophistication of</v>

906
00:40:59.281 --> 00:41:00.930
<v Speaker 3>their drinks and their ability to remember the,</v>

907
00:41:00.931 --> 00:41:03.410
<v Speaker 3>but we also might bucket your fantasy so maybe you know,</v>

908
00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:07.740
<v Speaker 3>you have a fantasy about what you really liked to say to your boss and it's a</v>

909
00:41:07.741 --> 00:41:11.310
<v Speaker 3>fairly well developed from maybe or hit embarrassed about it because it's kind</v>

910
00:41:11.311 --> 00:41:12.144
<v Speaker 3>of violence.</v>

911
00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:13.223
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

912
00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:16.460
<v Speaker 3>if we let you have that say,</v>

913
00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:17.820
<v Speaker 3>well tell me about the fantasy.</v>

914
00:41:17.821 --> 00:41:19.650
<v Speaker 3>Do you lay it out a fantasy?</v>

915
00:41:19.651 --> 00:41:23.790
<v Speaker 3>We can take weekend at the seeds of who you might be calm because maybe you're</v>

916
00:41:23.890 --> 00:41:25.940
<v Speaker 3>not standing up for yourself and not feed your boss.</v>

917
00:41:25.941 --> 00:41:27.010
<v Speaker 3>It's time to retire.</v>

918
00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:32.250
<v Speaker 3>And so you have this fantasy that you're rooted in the direction that that lays</v>

919
00:41:32.251 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 3>out the landscape of what look</v>

920
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:34.190
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

921
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:37.670
<v Speaker 2>If you find it just got up enough courage to march in there and say exactly what</v>

922
00:41:37.671 --> 00:41:38.810
<v Speaker 2>you have to say.</v>

923
00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:40.550
<v Speaker 2>And so that's something you want.</v>

924
00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:44.240
<v Speaker 2>And if you're thinking about changing careers that we want to figure out what</v>

925
00:41:44.241 --> 00:41:44.811
<v Speaker 2>you want.</v>

926
00:41:44.811 --> 00:41:48.050
<v Speaker 2>And so you can look up what you're fantasizing about what you want.</v>

927
00:41:48.051 --> 00:41:50.510
<v Speaker 2>And maybe you could find some seats and what you want.</v>

928
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:51.501
<v Speaker 2>You might say,</v>

929
00:41:51.501 --> 00:41:52.040
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

930
00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:55.220
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to be happy in the next job regardless of what you do unless</v>

931
00:41:55.221 --> 00:41:58.760
<v Speaker 2>you become somewhat more assertive because he'll just carry the same problem</v>

932
00:41:58.761 --> 00:41:59.610
<v Speaker 2>into your next job.</v>

933
00:41:59.611 --> 00:42:01.570
<v Speaker 2>So getting the problem is the job.</v>

934
00:42:01.650 --> 00:42:06.650
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the problem is do we did knock on what you really need to do to thrive in</v>

935
00:42:07.050 --> 00:42:09.320
<v Speaker 2>work and you can try to solve that problem.</v>

936
00:42:09.321 --> 00:42:11.930
<v Speaker 2>And then we started figuring out whether that would also mean that you would</v>

937
00:42:11.931 --> 00:42:13.160
<v Speaker 2>have to shift careers.</v>

938
00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:15.940
<v Speaker 2>And so that's how you can use the analysis of say,</v>

939
00:42:15.941 --> 00:42:20.941
<v Speaker 2>fantasies and dreams to shed light on how it is with the person might conduct</v>

940
00:42:21.171 --> 00:42:22.004
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

941
00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:22.963
<v Speaker 2>Now</v>

942
00:42:30.070 --> 00:42:31.270
<v Speaker 2>this is where it gets tricky.</v>

943
00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:33.290
<v Speaker 2>Casey hasn't got treats.</v>

944
00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:34.133
<v Speaker 2>You can ask him.</v>

945
00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:35.263
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

946
00:42:45.370 --> 00:42:45.690
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

947
00:42:45.690 --> 00:42:47.760
<v Speaker 2>So here's another way that you figure out</v>

948
00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:49.950
<v Speaker 2>how it happened.</v>

949
00:42:49.950 --> 00:42:50.783
<v Speaker 2>You were,</v>

950
00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:55.860
<v Speaker 2>let's say your your child and there's a lot you don't know.</v>

951
00:42:57.570 --> 00:42:58.860
<v Speaker 2>So how do you handle that?</v>

952
00:42:59.610 --> 00:42:59.731
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

953
00:42:59.731 --> 00:43:01.440
<v Speaker 2>you stay in a simplified environment,</v>

954
00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:02.633
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

955
00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:06.570
<v Speaker 2>You don't crawl out onto the street when you're 10 months old,</v>

956
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:08.080
<v Speaker 2>your parents aren't gonna let you do that.</v>

957
00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:11.790
<v Speaker 2>And they keep you in the phone and they keep you close to them.</v>

958
00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:15.230
<v Speaker 2>And what you do is react though.</v>

959
00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:16.080
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

960
00:43:16.290 --> 00:43:17.130
<v Speaker 2>which isn't very much.</v>

961
00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:21.220
<v Speaker 2>Mostly it's how quick things in your boat with an index because that's what she,</v>

962
00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:22.320
<v Speaker 2>that's what kids do.</v>

963
00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:26.160
<v Speaker 2>And just smiling kids to play a little bit.</v>

964
00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:30.430
<v Speaker 2>But it's a fragile space of knowledge and it's easily disrupted.</v>

965
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:32.070
<v Speaker 2>And when it's disrupted,</v>

966
00:43:32.071 --> 00:43:32.904
<v Speaker 2>you cry.</v>

967
00:43:33.390 --> 00:43:35.070
<v Speaker 2>And that's a signal up to the disruption.</v>

968
00:43:35.370 --> 00:43:37.140
<v Speaker 2>And then your parents move in.</v>

969
00:43:37.141 --> 00:43:38.610
<v Speaker 2>If their grade are you all watching,</v>

970
00:43:38.611 --> 00:43:43.611
<v Speaker 2>they fix whatever the problems and what you do is you watch and then you imitate</v>

971
00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:45.063
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

972
00:43:45.250 --> 00:43:45.751
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like,</v>

973
00:43:45.751 --> 00:43:46.201
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

974
00:43:46.201 --> 00:43:46.800
<v Speaker 2>the rock could you,</v>

975
00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:48.990
<v Speaker 2>cause you're not sophisticated enough to know what they're up to.</v>

976
00:43:49.410 --> 00:43:50.060
<v Speaker 2>Heal childhood.</v>

977
00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:52.200
<v Speaker 2>You get to pull the town with the behavior of the parents.</v>

978
00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:54.890
<v Speaker 2>No parents should give a full account of her own behavior.</v>

979
00:43:54.910 --> 00:43:57.120
<v Speaker 2>So you certainly can't expect that from a child.</v>

980
00:43:57.340 --> 00:44:00.930
<v Speaker 2>But children often will obviously grow up to take care of their own children,</v>

981
00:44:00.931 --> 00:44:05.931
<v Speaker 2>just like grow up to take care of their own offspring ever knowing what they're</v>

982
00:44:06.091 --> 00:44:06.451
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

983
00:44:06.451 --> 00:44:07.284
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

984
00:44:07.310 --> 00:44:08.480
<v Speaker 2>So you learn by amputation.</v>

985
00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:14.430
<v Speaker 2>And what that means is that collectively we faced things that we didn't</v>

986
00:44:15.751 --> 00:44:17.310
<v Speaker 2>understand for very,</v>

987
00:44:17.311 --> 00:44:21.780
<v Speaker 2>very long periods of time and we've figured out how to act so that it works</v>

988
00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:22.510
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

989
00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:23.520
<v Speaker 2>We don't know.</v>

990
00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:25.760
<v Speaker 2>We don't know the rules that underlie that.</v>

991
00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:26.230
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

992
00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:27.900
<v Speaker 2>We don't know exactly what that means.</v>

993
00:44:28.110 --> 00:44:29.070
<v Speaker 2>We just figured it out.</v>

994
00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:32.940
<v Speaker 2>So there was a way of being,</v>

995
00:44:32.941 --> 00:44:35.890
<v Speaker 2>a good partner might say there's a way to be a good mother.</v>

996
00:44:36.350 --> 00:44:41.280
<v Speaker 2>Mostly you understand what that is when you fail at it or when your child,</v>

997
00:44:41.281 --> 00:44:42.770
<v Speaker 2>he accuses you of failing at it,</v>

998
00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:43.351
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

999
00:44:43.351 --> 00:44:46.770
<v Speaker 2>Because he's only in the failure that you realize that you deviate from whatever</v>

1000
00:44:46.771 --> 00:44:48.310
<v Speaker 2>the ideal is cause you're not.</v>

1001
00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:50.990
<v Speaker 2>Who the hell knows what the rules are for beacon?</v>

1002
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:51.833
<v Speaker 2>Good father.</v>

1003
00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:55.320
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult to detail them but you know when you've failed.</v>

1004
00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:55.891
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1005
00:44:55.891 --> 00:45:00.450
<v Speaker 2>so you know how to be a controller and you know that because you imitated your</v>

1006
00:45:00.451 --> 00:45:02.730
<v Speaker 2>father and he imitated his father images.</v>

1007
00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:07.250
<v Speaker 2>His father is like way back as far as you can possibly jolt.</v>

1008
00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:08.400
<v Speaker 2>That's the rule.</v>

1009
00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:09.930
<v Speaker 2>We also know that and here's,</v>

1010
00:45:09.931 --> 00:45:11.060
<v Speaker 2>here's an example of why,</v>

1011
00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:15.050
<v Speaker 2>how the clock called colleague at the University of Toronto who spends some</v>

1012
00:45:15.051 --> 00:45:17.430
<v Speaker 2>maternal behavior and racks and racks,</v>

1013
00:45:17.431 --> 00:45:18.860
<v Speaker 2>you're actually very sophisticated.</v>

1014
00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:23.350
<v Speaker 2>They have somewhat of a cultural state pass on through imitative learning.</v>

1015
00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:28.710
<v Speaker 2>If you take rap cops away from their mother and and treat them well enough so</v>

1016
00:45:28.711 --> 00:45:29.730
<v Speaker 2>that they live in,</v>

1017
00:45:29.731 --> 00:45:31.230
<v Speaker 2>which is not that easy by the way,</v>

1018
00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:35.850
<v Speaker 2>cause feeding them and giving them enough water and warmth and so forth isn't</v>

1019
00:45:35.851 --> 00:45:36.151
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>

1020
00:45:36.151 --> 00:45:37.650
<v Speaker 2>You also have to attend to them.</v>

1021
00:45:37.651 --> 00:45:38.441
<v Speaker 2>You have to touch them.</v>

1022
00:45:38.441 --> 00:45:41.760
<v Speaker 2>You played it the more they die anyways.</v>

1023
00:45:41.761 --> 00:45:45.450
<v Speaker 2>If you take prep helps away from their mother and then you let those routes grow</v>

1024
00:45:45.451 --> 00:45:50.090
<v Speaker 2>up and have to wrap apps and then those wrap crops grow up and have red crops,</v>

1025
00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:50.980
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

1026
00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:54.510
<v Speaker 2>You find that the maternal behavior is disruptive for three generations.</v>

1027
00:45:55.530 --> 00:46:00.090
<v Speaker 2>So that shows you why you need that imitative continuity in order to keep</v>

1028
00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:03.840
<v Speaker 2>knowledge that's implicit propagating through a culture.</v>

1029
00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:06.930
<v Speaker 2>So once it's disruptive,</v>

1030
00:46:06.931 --> 00:46:09.710
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult to local once again ask.</v>

1031
00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:11.183
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1032
00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:18.620
<v Speaker 2>we've learned how to be good and bad by trial and error,</v>

1033
00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:21.180
<v Speaker 2>very long periods of time.</v>

1034
00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:27.070
<v Speaker 2>We've learned that an imaging back from the people that we see who are good,</v>

1035
00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:28.103
<v Speaker 2>the hug,</v>

1036
00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:30.270
<v Speaker 2>and we've learned how to embody that.</v>

1037
00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:33.660
<v Speaker 2>And so we carry that on with us in our actions.</v>

1038
00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:37.470
<v Speaker 2>Now you actually do this in quite a sophisticated way,</v>

1039
00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:40.830
<v Speaker 2>even though you can't describe it exactly.</v>

1040
00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:45.750
<v Speaker 2>So let's say you go to a party and if someone that gets annoying and they're</v>

1041
00:46:45.751 --> 00:46:48.930
<v Speaker 2>annoying because they tell jokes that aren't funny and they've been off the</v>

1042
00:46:48.931 --> 00:46:53.040
<v Speaker 2>lights and conversation and they don't pay any attention to anyone else,</v>

1043
00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:55.410
<v Speaker 2>they're full of micro errors.</v>

1044
00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:57.510
<v Speaker 2>That made me socially be tolerable.</v>

1045
00:46:58.230 --> 00:46:59.430
<v Speaker 2>And so what they,</v>

1046
00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:01.020
<v Speaker 2>what they are doing is easy.</v>

1047
00:47:01.021 --> 00:47:02.690
<v Speaker 2>Anything from your implicit ideal,</v>

1048
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:03.720
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1049
00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:04.620
<v Speaker 2>That's why they're annoying,</v>

1050
00:47:05.250 --> 00:47:06.120
<v Speaker 2>obviously,</v>

1051
00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:09.090
<v Speaker 2>because they're not eating the way they should be educated.</v>

1052
00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:11.130
<v Speaker 2>And you could tell that because they're annoying.</v>

1053
00:47:11.310 --> 00:47:15.180
<v Speaker 2>And so what that means is that you have an ideal that you're expecting from</v>

1054
00:47:15.181 --> 00:47:16.350
<v Speaker 2>other people over time.</v>

1055
00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:19.140
<v Speaker 2>And that isn't the case because wherever we go,</v>

1056
00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:23.730
<v Speaker 2>we meet people and we expect and hope that they will act out the ideal.</v>

1057
00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:25.201
<v Speaker 2>And when they don't,</v>

1058
00:47:25.201 --> 00:47:26.034
<v Speaker 2>we know.</v>

1059
00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:29.070
<v Speaker 2>But that doesn't mean you can say what it is cause you can know,</v>

1060
00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:30.840
<v Speaker 2>go home with your partner and say,</v>

1061
00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:31.901
<v Speaker 2>I was that person.</v>

1062
00:47:31.901 --> 00:47:32.810
<v Speaker 2>So annoying.</v>

1063
00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:34.730
<v Speaker 2>And You yes if I'm Chad.</v>

1064
00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:39.580
<v Speaker 2>But it's hard to specify because you don't move the ideal that you don't know</v>

1065
00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:40.990
<v Speaker 2>exactly what it was to break through.</v>

1066
00:47:40.991 --> 00:47:42.760
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult to beat this articulate,</v>

1067
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:44.800
<v Speaker 2>but you do have any ideal in mind.</v>

1068
00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:46.300
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

1069
00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:51.300
<v Speaker 2>So what that means is that we can act out and conceptualized before we could</v>

1070
00:47:54.850 --> 00:47:58.300
<v Speaker 2>describe in words what that ideal he is.</v>

1071
00:47:59.050 --> 00:48:00.840
<v Speaker 2>Now this</v>

1072
00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:04.751
<v Speaker 2>development,</v>

1073
00:48:04.751 --> 00:48:05.540
<v Speaker 2>as they call it,</v>

1074
00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:10.420
<v Speaker 2>the junk studied kids 30 gauge.</v>

1075
00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:15.430
<v Speaker 2>And that doesn't necessarily sound very important or just gauged it just for</v>

1076
00:48:15.431 --> 00:48:16.264
<v Speaker 2>fun.</v>

1077
00:48:16.690 --> 00:48:21.690
<v Speaker 2>But it's really important because the game is actually a microcosm of the world.</v>

1078
00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:25.390
<v Speaker 2>Just what people like cage played.</v>

1079
00:48:25.391 --> 00:48:26.710
<v Speaker 2>Monopoly example.</v>

1080
00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:31.750
<v Speaker 2>It's a microcosm of no holds barred capitalism,</v>

1081
00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:32.973
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>

1082
00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:35.080
<v Speaker 2>And you can learn about your bedroom people,</v>

1083
00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:39.070
<v Speaker 2>about people by playing monopoly with them because even though it's fictional</v>

1084
00:48:39.590 --> 00:48:44.590
<v Speaker 2>and the gold is just real people that adopt the goal was if it's really that he</v>

1085
00:48:44.711 --> 00:48:47.710
<v Speaker 2>started to manifest be emotions that would be relevant and getting a real</v>

1086
00:48:47.711 --> 00:48:52.711
<v Speaker 2>pursuit and so that you can see what they're fun to play with and if they're fun</v>

1087
00:48:52.881 --> 00:48:53.900
<v Speaker 2>to play with and</v>

1088
00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:57.230
<v Speaker 2>it'll get a little high and mighty about winning,</v>

1089
00:48:57.250 --> 00:48:57.571
<v Speaker 2>he don't,</v>

1090
00:48:57.571 --> 00:48:59.960
<v Speaker 2>they [inaudible] to lock.</v>

1091
00:49:00.310 --> 00:49:04.840
<v Speaker 2>They detach themselves from a little bit so that it stays fun.</v>

1092
00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:05.141
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1093
00:49:05.141 --> 00:49:06.330
<v Speaker 2>remember that it's a game,</v>

1094
00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:08.380
<v Speaker 2>like they're doing all sorts of sophisticated things.</v>

1095
00:49:08.381 --> 00:49:12.970
<v Speaker 2>If they're funding by Jessica number that they're trying to play with your</v>

1096
00:49:12.971 --> 00:49:13.720
<v Speaker 2>testing,</v>

1097
00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:14.970
<v Speaker 2>how well they match deep.</v>

1098
00:49:14.970 --> 00:49:16.570
<v Speaker 2>Was that ideal that you will?</v>

1099
00:49:16.990 --> 00:49:21.040
<v Speaker 2>And so that's what kids are doing when they played games with their friends to</v>

1100
00:49:21.041 --> 00:49:21.580
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

1101
00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:23.640
<v Speaker 2>it's more complicated because they also the way,</v>

1102
00:49:23.641 --> 00:49:24.290
<v Speaker 2>then again,</v>

1103
00:49:24.290 --> 00:49:25.990
<v Speaker 2>just basically that they're pretending.</v>

1104
00:49:26.050 --> 00:49:29.890
<v Speaker 2>So let's say kids who frequents the decides we're going to play hubs.</v>

1105
00:49:30.490 --> 00:49:32.620
<v Speaker 2>This is a common kits and Damon,</v>

1106
00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:34.870
<v Speaker 2>first thing they do is have them negotiation.</v>

1107
00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:37.390
<v Speaker 2>So unlikely to screen writers.</v>

1108
00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:39.160
<v Speaker 2>They say,</v>

1109
00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:41.260
<v Speaker 2>well you be the moment you'd be the dad,</v>

1110
00:49:41.350 --> 00:49:46.330
<v Speaker 2>you don't need to be the cap and then if everyone wants to play that role,</v>

1111
00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:49.080
<v Speaker 2>but that's the first thing the kids have hope.</v>

1112
00:49:49.090 --> 00:49:51.810
<v Speaker 2>Kids have to want to play voluntarily or it's not good.</v>

1113
00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:53.680
<v Speaker 2>That's a good thing to keep in mind.</v>

1114
00:49:53.950 --> 00:49:56.350
<v Speaker 2>So putting accepts the rule and then you might say,</v>

1115
00:49:56.351 --> 00:50:00.040
<v Speaker 2>well then they go ahead and take the mother and the father and the cap,</v>

1116
00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:03.660
<v Speaker 2>but they don't actually think I taped it because like if I was imitating you sit</v>

1117
00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:05.020
<v Speaker 2>exactly like your city,</v>

1118
00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:07.990
<v Speaker 2>but I would move my body in exactly the same where you are.</v>

1119
00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:10.240
<v Speaker 2>But if I was caricatured review,</v>

1120
00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:11.830
<v Speaker 2>let's say I got to know you a little bit,</v>

1121
00:50:11.831 --> 00:50:15.340
<v Speaker 2>then I can kind of adopt the spirit of your voice and your mannerisms,</v>

1122
00:50:15.341 --> 00:50:16.180
<v Speaker 2>whatever they are.</v>

1123
00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:19.870
<v Speaker 2>I could extract out from you a pattern of character and it's giving me an I can</v>

1124
00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:24.270
<v Speaker 2>body that pattern that's a lot more sophisticated and just invitation and not</v>

1125
00:50:24.271 --> 00:50:27.490
<v Speaker 2>for the kids are trying to do when they played house and I'm indicating they're</v>

1126
00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:28.120
<v Speaker 2>far down</v>

1127
00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:32.470
<v Speaker 3>because they're not doing exactly the same movements that the I was doing.</v>

1128
00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:33.770
<v Speaker 3>They've watched the farther,</v>

1129
00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:38.830
<v Speaker 3>either farther over multiple contexts and they've extracted the commonalities</v>

1130
00:50:38.931 --> 00:50:43.150
<v Speaker 3>across those contexts and portrayed back with the term before that.</v>

1131
00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:45.170
<v Speaker 3>You can think about that as a spirit.</v>

1132
00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:47.020
<v Speaker 3>It's the spirit of that man.</v>

1133
00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:51.650
<v Speaker 3>He before non personal multiple context and then they're acting that out there</v>

1134
00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:56.340
<v Speaker 3>representing that good boy and he hit dramatic play and so they can't say what</v>

1135
00:50:56.341 --> 00:50:58.550
<v Speaker 3>they're doing and they can't tell you what the rules are,</v>

1136
00:50:58.551 --> 00:51:02.690
<v Speaker 3>but they can use their own body to represent this incredibly complex thing that</v>

1137
00:51:02.691 --> 00:51:03.524
<v Speaker 3>they don't understand.</v>

1138
00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:05.510
<v Speaker 3>And they can do the same thing with mother,</v>

1139
00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:06.200
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1140
00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:08.960
<v Speaker 3>If you play with a goal and feed it and do all the things for the mother</v>

1141
00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:09.530
<v Speaker 3>doesn't,</v>

1142
00:51:09.530 --> 00:51:13.970
<v Speaker 3>they can practice being a mother and so then they learn how to embody this ideal</v>

1143
00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:16.370
<v Speaker 3>without describing it.</v>

1144
00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:22.020
<v Speaker 3>Now there's a lot of things that we know like that and so we know how to act out</v>

1145
00:51:22.431 --> 00:51:25.070
<v Speaker 3>things that you don't understand it now.</v>

1146
00:51:25.230 --> 00:51:30.230
<v Speaker 3>Eventually we figured out what collectively over the tens of thousands of years</v>

1147
00:51:30.571 --> 00:51:32.030
<v Speaker 3>that you've been trying to figure things out,</v>

1148
00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:37.230
<v Speaker 3>how to act in a manner that makes us essentially sig the signature of civilize</v>

1149
00:51:37.330 --> 00:51:39.380
<v Speaker 3>the neighbor's or somebody's sick in this group,</v>

1150
00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:42.590
<v Speaker 3>even though we don't know each other and to all do the same thing,</v>

1151
00:51:42.850 --> 00:51:43.550
<v Speaker 3>all the dog,</v>

1152
00:51:43.550 --> 00:51:47.420
<v Speaker 3>the same posture and to oligarchs essentially the same attitude and the same</v>

1153
00:51:47.421 --> 00:51:52.310
<v Speaker 3>emotional state and to thereby being predictable to one another and to be safe</v>

1154
00:51:52.311 --> 00:51:53.150
<v Speaker 3>with one another,</v>

1155
00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:54.410
<v Speaker 3>which is what we're doing right now.</v>

1156
00:51:54.411 --> 00:51:55.310
<v Speaker 3>It's a ritual.</v>

1157
00:51:55.370 --> 00:51:57.800
<v Speaker 3>Everyone understands his a theatrical Richard,</v>

1158
00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:02.510
<v Speaker 3>that everyone understands it and the fact that everyone is doing the same thing,</v>

1159
00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:05.660
<v Speaker 3>it means that we can all be virtually assured that at the moment we're all</v>

1160
00:52:05.661 --> 00:52:10.160
<v Speaker 3>holding the same ideal and that's why we're not terrified because if someone all</v>

1161
00:52:10.161 --> 00:52:11.970
<v Speaker 3>of a sudden stood up and branch did knife,</v>

1162
00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:14.480
<v Speaker 3>this was not be the same place.</v>

1163
00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:14.991
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1164
00:52:14.991 --> 00:52:15.840
<v Speaker 3>It was seriously,</v>

1165
00:52:15.841 --> 00:52:19.370
<v Speaker 3>if you don't want the same place and you wouldn't be using the same part of your</v>

1166
00:52:19.371 --> 00:52:20.600
<v Speaker 3>brain to process it,</v>

1167
00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:25.960
<v Speaker 3>it would switch instantly and you'd be possessed by ancient motivational states,</v>

1168
00:52:26.211 --> 00:52:31.211
<v Speaker 3>terror and rage and and the preparation for action that would be completely</v>

1169
00:52:31.221 --> 00:52:35.720
<v Speaker 3>outside of the neurological systems that you're using to Orient Yourself at this</v>

1170
00:52:35.721 --> 00:52:36.140
<v Speaker 3>movement.</v>

1171
00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:39.320
<v Speaker 3>And people do not have to like it when that happens.</v>

1172
00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:42.350
<v Speaker 3>We don't like even if someone you don't like,</v>

1173
00:52:42.351 --> 00:52:46.610
<v Speaker 3>that's like if you're walking down the street and you see someone who's doing</v>

1174
00:52:46.611 --> 00:52:48.950
<v Speaker 3>something that isn't normal,</v>

1175
00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:51.920
<v Speaker 3>like maybe they're monitoring to consultant twitching a little bit or something</v>

1176
00:52:51.921 --> 00:52:53.930
<v Speaker 3>like that and they're a little disheveled.</v>

1177
00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:56.810
<v Speaker 3>You'll do what almost everyone does,</v>

1178
00:52:56.870 --> 00:53:00.320
<v Speaker 3>which is we'll give them a wide berth and you'll keep on walking and you</v>

1179
00:53:00.321 --> 00:53:05.321
<v Speaker 3>probably do what you can not to make eye contact because that's an invitation.</v>

1180
00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:06.763
<v Speaker 3>So you're,</v>

1181
00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:07.111
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1182
00:53:07.111 --> 00:53:08.420
<v Speaker 3>you walked down the street and you think,</v>

1183
00:53:08.421 --> 00:53:13.020
<v Speaker 3>oh there's some unexplored territory like circumvented that and maybe</v>

1184
00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:13.960
<v Speaker 3>particularly one.</v>

1185
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:14.340
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1186
00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:19.040
<v Speaker 3>So you do everything you can as a consequence of your actions to stop yourself</v>

1187
00:53:19.070 --> 00:53:23.210
<v Speaker 3>from being exposed to anything that disrupts the stability of the theory that</v>

1188
00:53:23.211 --> 00:53:25.010
<v Speaker 3>you're using or hit yourself in the world.</v>

1189
00:53:25.290 --> 00:53:29.160
<v Speaker 3>That's why people hold onto their theories because underneath that it's like</v>

1190
00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:29.910
<v Speaker 3>terror,</v>

1191
00:53:29.910 --> 00:53:32.160
<v Speaker 3>rage and you don't want that coming up.</v>

1192
00:53:32.161 --> 00:53:34.500
<v Speaker 3>And so we don't take it kindly.</v>

1193
00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:37.590
<v Speaker 3>People come along and mess with our,</v>

1194
00:53:37.650 --> 00:53:39.240
<v Speaker 3>the axioms of our theories.</v>

1195
00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:40.950
<v Speaker 3>We seriously don't like that.</v>

1196
00:53:40.951 --> 00:53:44.730
<v Speaker 3>And that's partly why people are so motivated to protect their belief systems,</v>

1197
00:53:44.731 --> 00:53:45.210
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1198
00:53:45.210 --> 00:53:47.380
<v Speaker 3>It's not only then we construe the world,</v>

1199
00:53:47.550 --> 00:53:48.420
<v Speaker 3>our belief systems,</v>

1200
00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:50.490
<v Speaker 3>we organize our social behavior,</v>

1201
00:53:50.491 --> 00:53:51.540
<v Speaker 3>we thought and belief systems.</v>

1202
00:53:51.541 --> 00:53:53.520
<v Speaker 3>And so if you mess with the police systems,</v>

1203
00:53:53.790 --> 00:53:57.900
<v Speaker 3>you mess with the structure that makes everyone predictable of everyone else.</v>

1204
00:53:58.180 --> 00:53:59.960
<v Speaker 3>And that is not what I,</v>

1205
00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:02.430
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing but hell would that when that path,</v>

1206
00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:03.420
<v Speaker 3>that's for sure.</v>

1207
00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:04.261
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

1208
00:54:04.261 --> 00:54:06.090
<v Speaker 3>so now</v>

1209
00:54:07.770 --> 00:54:12.770
<v Speaker 3>we've learned how to act out this pattern that makes us acceptable and desirable</v>

1210
00:54:13.051 --> 00:54:17.340
<v Speaker 3>project and we're constantly reminding each other how do that,</v>

1211
00:54:17.341 --> 00:54:19.020
<v Speaker 3>because like if you go to a party,</v>

1212
00:54:19.770 --> 00:54:20.940
<v Speaker 3>you're going to want people,</v>

1213
00:54:20.970 --> 00:54:22.590
<v Speaker 3>well who knows what you've been walked by.</v>

1214
00:54:22.770 --> 00:54:24.540
<v Speaker 3>If you're the typical person,</v>

1215
00:54:24.541 --> 00:54:25.021
<v Speaker 3>a typical,</v>

1216
00:54:25.021 --> 00:54:26.760
<v Speaker 3>reasonably well socialized person,</v>

1217
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:28.210
<v Speaker 3>you're going to want people to like,</v>

1218
00:54:28.410 --> 00:54:29.620
<v Speaker 3>or that they disliked,</v>

1219
00:54:29.621 --> 00:54:30.150
<v Speaker 3>he would.</v>

1220
00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:32.850
<v Speaker 3>You're going to want them to pay some attention to you and you're going to want</v>

1221
00:54:32.851 --> 00:54:35.950
<v Speaker 3>to engage people in interesting conversation.</v>

1222
00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:39.840
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you're going to want people to appreciate you and you know if you want to</v>

1223
00:54:39.841 --> 00:54:44.310
<v Speaker 3>have a good time to have a good time at the party needs to act a certain way</v>

1224
00:54:44.311 --> 00:54:47.730
<v Speaker 3>that you're listening to certain separate responses from other people and if you</v>

1225
00:54:47.731 --> 00:54:50.070
<v Speaker 3>fail it that they will tell you,</v>

1226
00:54:50.730 --> 00:54:51.630
<v Speaker 3>they'll ignore you.</v>

1227
00:54:52.050 --> 00:54:53.490
<v Speaker 3>They won't laugh at your jokes,</v>

1228
00:54:53.730 --> 00:54:53.971
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1229
00:54:53.971 --> 00:54:55.350
<v Speaker 3>they'll move away from you.</v>

1230
00:54:55.370 --> 00:54:55.550
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

1231
00:54:55.550 --> 00:54:57.090
<v Speaker 3>there's all sorts of reasons.</v>

1232
00:54:57.150 --> 00:54:59.550
<v Speaker 3>There's all sorts of things they will do to broadcast.</v>

1233
00:54:59.551 --> 00:55:00.300
<v Speaker 3>At you,</v>

1234
00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:01.920
<v Speaker 3>your deviation from the ideal.</v>

1235
00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:04.050
<v Speaker 3>And that can be very painful,</v>

1236
00:55:04.110 --> 00:55:04.560
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1237
00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:08.400
<v Speaker 3>Especially if you're very deviant from the ideal because it opens up this</v>

1238
00:55:08.401 --> 00:55:11.730
<v Speaker 3>realization that you just don't know what the hell are you doing at all.</v>

1239
00:55:11.790 --> 00:55:15.440
<v Speaker 3>And that either means that other people are contemptible and horrible at that</v>

1240
00:55:15.450 --> 00:55:19.050
<v Speaker 3>something should be done about that or that there's something seriously wrong</v>

1241
00:55:19.051 --> 00:55:20.520
<v Speaker 3>with you that needs to be rectified.</v>

1242
00:55:20.730 --> 00:55:22.920
<v Speaker 3>And neither of those options are very pleasant.</v>

1243
00:55:23.790 --> 00:55:26.130
<v Speaker 3>So we carry within us,</v>

1244
00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:29.280
<v Speaker 3>let's say place that ideal that we carry within us,</v>

1245
00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:32.090
<v Speaker 3>a counter ideal as well be the opposite of that.</v>

1246
00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:36.690
<v Speaker 3>That's an introduction in some sense to the landscape of good and evil because</v>

1247
00:55:36.691 --> 00:55:41.691
<v Speaker 3>the ultimate ideal is whatever's good and the ultimate counter whatevers evil.</v>

1248
00:55:42.570 --> 00:55:47.570
<v Speaker 3>So that's the space within which we map our behaviors and we can't help but map</v>

1249
00:55:48.670 --> 00:55:50.460
<v Speaker 3>help that spacing cause it's,</v>

1250
00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:54.930
<v Speaker 3>it constitutes the most extreme version of the structure that we use to evaluate</v>

1251
00:55:54.990 --> 00:55:56.160
<v Speaker 3>everything everyone else does.</v>

1252
00:55:56.161 --> 00:55:57.120
<v Speaker 3>And every four week.</v>

1253
00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:01.230
<v Speaker 3>We also know that that's the case because when you go to a movie,</v>

1254
00:56:01.290 --> 00:56:02.670
<v Speaker 3>even though you don't know that,</v>

1255
00:56:02.671 --> 00:56:04.170
<v Speaker 3>you know it's the case,</v>

1256
00:56:04.350 --> 00:56:05.430
<v Speaker 3>you go to a movie,</v>

1257
00:56:05.610 --> 00:56:08.250
<v Speaker 3>let's say it's an action or it doesn't matter,</v>

1258
00:56:08.251 --> 00:56:08.780
<v Speaker 3>it could be a,</v>

1259
00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:12.000
<v Speaker 3>so maybe those are the two basic categories of votes.</v>

1260
00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:14.460
<v Speaker 3>Actually he has a hero.</v>

1261
00:56:14.740 --> 00:56:18.990
<v Speaker 3>The hero is either good or partially do it like a complex here would be good,</v>

1262
00:56:18.991 --> 00:56:21.330
<v Speaker 3>but even kind of a flawed and interesting way.</v>

1263
00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:26.350
<v Speaker 3>And then of course in an action movie there's the evil bad guy as well,</v>

1264
00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:29.110
<v Speaker 3>but hopefully he's going to benefit good interview because otherwise it's a</v>

1265
00:56:29.330 --> 00:56:31.990
<v Speaker 3>caricatured always into movies.</v>

1266
00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:36.430
<v Speaker 3>You have that the hero and the villain and the romance welded.</v>

1267
00:56:36.490 --> 00:56:39.880
<v Speaker 3>You have the person who's the love interest in all those who've failed to</v>

1268
00:56:39.881 --> 00:56:40.714
<v Speaker 3>measure up.</v>

1269
00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:41.760
<v Speaker 3>And so it's just saying,</v>

1270
00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:42.593
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1271
00:56:42.910 --> 00:56:45.550
<v Speaker 3>it's just played out for different multiplication reasons.</v>

1272
00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:47.050
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1273
00:56:47.050 --> 00:56:48.590
<v Speaker 3>and you know it's,</v>

1274
00:56:48.670 --> 00:56:51.370
<v Speaker 3>it's difficult to understand it and you go to see your movie,</v>

1275
00:56:51.371 --> 00:56:52.750
<v Speaker 3>which is fiction</v>

1276
00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:55.570
<v Speaker 3>isn't real.</v>

1277
00:56:56.290 --> 00:57:00.740
<v Speaker 3>Then it's also more regal than real because otherwise you either watch,</v>

1278
00:57:00.770 --> 00:57:05.770
<v Speaker 3>you don't want the movie director to show you how many times to protagonists</v>

1279
00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:09.760
<v Speaker 3>links before they get out a bed in the morning.</v>

1280
00:57:10.210 --> 00:57:15.210
<v Speaker 3>It's not interesting when you want them to do is to take the full panoply of the</v>

1281
00:57:16.271 --> 00:57:21.271
<v Speaker 3>heroes behavior and only extract from those instances that are of particular</v>

1282
00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:26.250
<v Speaker 3>interest in relationship to the portrayal of that ideal or the counter idea.</v>

1283
00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:28.630
<v Speaker 3>Do you want to see why the bad guys bad?</v>

1284
00:57:28.690 --> 00:57:30.730
<v Speaker 3>And you want to see why they good guys good.</v>

1285
00:57:31.060 --> 00:57:34.870
<v Speaker 3>And that's more real than reality because it's abstract that from reality it's</v>

1286
00:57:34.871 --> 00:57:36.040
<v Speaker 3>more real than reality.</v>

1287
00:57:36.041 --> 00:57:39.250
<v Speaker 3>Like numbers are more real than the things they they're derived from.</v>

1288
00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:40.720
<v Speaker 3>It's a form of abstraction,</v>

1289
00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:41.591
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1290
00:57:41.591 --> 00:57:42.101
<v Speaker 3>And it doesn't,</v>

1291
00:57:42.101 --> 00:57:46.090
<v Speaker 3>it makes perfect sense that when you want to extract that from fictional</v>

1292
00:57:46.091 --> 00:57:47.010
<v Speaker 3>representations,</v>

1293
00:57:47.011 --> 00:57:50.290
<v Speaker 3>just referenced representations of what's good and what's evil.</v>

1294
00:57:50.291 --> 00:57:51.610
<v Speaker 3>So that in principle,</v>

1295
00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:53.230
<v Speaker 3>assuming that this is what you want,</v>

1296
00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:57.910
<v Speaker 3>you could do a better job of embodying what's good because then everything would</v>

1297
00:57:57.911 --> 00:57:59.380
<v Speaker 3>go well for you in the war room,</v>

1298
00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:00.970
<v Speaker 3>assuming that that's what you want.</v>

1299
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:04.840
<v Speaker 3>So there's probably nothing more important than you could possibly do.</v>

1300
00:58:04.930 --> 00:58:07.450
<v Speaker 3>The know do that and that's how you treat it.</v>

1301
00:58:07.451 --> 00:58:09.700
<v Speaker 3>Like it's more important than anything else you can do.</v>

1302
00:58:09.850 --> 00:58:11.290
<v Speaker 3>Because if you think about it,</v>

1303
00:58:11.530 --> 00:58:16.060
<v Speaker 3>you will go to a movie and you'll line up and you hae to be exposed to that kind</v>

1304
00:58:16.061 --> 00:58:16.894
<v Speaker 3>of information.</v>

1305
00:58:17.530 --> 00:58:18.071
<v Speaker 3>And that's an,</v>

1306
00:58:18.071 --> 00:58:20.380
<v Speaker 3>that's an indication of exactly how vital it is,</v>

1307
00:58:20.381 --> 00:58:20.800
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1308
00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:22.330
<v Speaker 3>You actually find most of you met.</v>

1309
00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:23.540
<v Speaker 3>And if it isn't movies,</v>

1310
00:58:23.541 --> 00:58:24.374
<v Speaker 3>well then it's,</v>

1311
00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:27.490
<v Speaker 3>it's fiction or books of stories that other people tell you.</v>

1312
00:58:27.491 --> 00:58:27.721
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

1313
00:58:27.721 --> 00:58:29.590
<v Speaker 3>you have no interest whatsoever in people.</v>

1314
00:58:29.591 --> 00:58:30.910
<v Speaker 3>And that's very rare.</v>

1315
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:32.440
<v Speaker 3>If even if that's the case,</v>

1316
00:58:32.441 --> 00:58:32.970
<v Speaker 3>you'll find it.</v>

1317
00:58:32.970 --> 00:58:36.430
<v Speaker 3>Science fiction or something else like that where the mythology creeps into the</v>

1318
00:58:36.431 --> 00:58:37.264
<v Speaker 3>technology,</v>

1319
00:58:37.330 --> 00:58:38.260
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't really matter.</v>

1320
00:58:38.270 --> 00:58:40.210
<v Speaker 3>It's going to come at you in one way or another.</v>

1321
00:58:40.510 --> 00:58:43.690
<v Speaker 3>And the fact that we will pay to expose yourself to that.</v>

1322
00:58:43.691 --> 00:58:46.660
<v Speaker 3>And then also that when you go into those venues,</v>

1323
00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:51.000
<v Speaker 3>be entranced by it to spite yourself despite the fact that you know it isn't</v>

1324
00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:51.873
<v Speaker 3>real,</v>

1325
00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:55.600
<v Speaker 3>it's an indication of exactly how important that information is.</v>

1326
00:58:55.601 --> 00:58:56.434
<v Speaker 3>Key.</v>

1327
00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:57.551
<v Speaker 3>So you could say,</v>

1328
00:58:57.551 --> 00:58:58.384
<v Speaker 3>well there's,</v>

1329
00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:02.740
<v Speaker 3>there's truth in the extraction of protections and then the question,</v>

1330
00:59:02.741 --> 00:59:03.574
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1331
00:59:04.210 --> 00:59:08.530
<v Speaker 3>well imagine that you have real life,</v>

1332
00:59:09.670 --> 00:59:13.330
<v Speaker 3>have never imagined that you have first order obstruction fiction,</v>

1333
00:59:13.331 --> 00:59:14.080
<v Speaker 3>which are,</v>

1334
00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:14.320
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1335
00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:16.620
<v Speaker 3>if someone's telling you the story about what they did last,</v>

1336
00:59:16.630 --> 00:59:20.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean some people are just going to bore you too because they're going to tell</v>

1337
00:59:20.801 --> 00:59:22.050
<v Speaker 3>you relevant details.</v>

1338
00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:23.860
<v Speaker 3>It's like why is it relevant?</v>

1339
00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:26.190
<v Speaker 3>What's the difference between what's relevant,</v>

1340
00:59:26.310 --> 00:59:29.030
<v Speaker 3>what is relevant makes you interested,</v>

1341
00:59:29.380 --> 00:59:30.213
<v Speaker 3>but why?</v>

1342
00:59:31.130 --> 00:59:32.060
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>

1343
00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:34.010
<v Speaker 3>You just know when that happens,</v>

1344
00:59:34.011 --> 00:59:35.900
<v Speaker 3>you know that the person is good at telling the story.</v>

1345
00:59:35.901 --> 00:59:39.650
<v Speaker 3>So what they're essentially doing is they're laying down your experience but not</v>

1346
00:59:39.651 --> 00:59:40.484
<v Speaker 3>all of it.</v>

1347
00:59:41.090 --> 00:59:42.560
<v Speaker 3>They're selective about,</v>

1348
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:44.570
<v Speaker 3>and that's what makes a born storyteller.</v>

1349
00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:48.890
<v Speaker 3>They do first order abstraction again first order fictionalization in some sense</v>

1350
00:59:48.891 --> 00:59:49.540
<v Speaker 3>they say,</v>

1351
00:59:49.540 --> 00:59:52.730
<v Speaker 3>here's a bunch of interesting things that have come in last week and those</v>

1352
00:59:52.731 --> 00:59:56.780
<v Speaker 3>interesting things have to have some bearing on your life in some way or you're</v>

1353
00:59:56.781 --> 00:59:58.050
<v Speaker 3>not going to find the interesting,</v>

1354
00:59:58.070 --> 00:59:58.903
<v Speaker 3>have a,</v>

1355
00:59:58.950 --> 01:00:01.280
<v Speaker 3>you have to know to extract something of value on there.</v>

1356
01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:02.660
<v Speaker 3>Somebody has got a point.</v>

1357
01:00:03.210 --> 01:00:03.851
<v Speaker 3>Point is wait,</v>

1358
01:00:03.851 --> 01:00:04.800
<v Speaker 3>directs you to some,</v>

1359
01:00:05.570 --> 01:00:07.910
<v Speaker 3>so that's what makes you interesting and then you might think,</v>

1360
01:00:07.911 --> 01:00:09.590
<v Speaker 3>well that's just the born storyteller,</v>

1361
01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:12.060
<v Speaker 3>but then you had people who are brilliant at it,</v>

1362
01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:13.690
<v Speaker 3>say writing awful circle.</v>

1363
01:00:13.770 --> 01:00:14.750
<v Speaker 3>We're producing movies,</v>

1364
01:00:14.751 --> 01:00:18.650
<v Speaker 3>street place and they're way better than a normal person that extracting out</v>

1365
01:00:18.651 --> 01:00:19.401
<v Speaker 3>what's important,</v>

1366
01:00:19.401 --> 01:00:23.870
<v Speaker 3>like they're geniuses at it and so they don't just extract out from their life</v>

1367
01:00:23.871 --> 01:00:24.651
<v Speaker 3>what's relevant.</v>

1368
01:00:24.651 --> 01:00:25.160
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>

1369
01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:28.970
<v Speaker 3>They look at a whole bunch of people and then how to distill that into a single</v>

1370
01:00:28.971 --> 01:00:32.720
<v Speaker 3>characters and then they extract out from them what's relevant and interesting</v>

1371
01:00:32.721 --> 01:00:37.721
<v Speaker 3>and they lay out for trailer good versus evil and transformation.</v>

1372
01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:39.740
<v Speaker 3>It's transfixing.</v>

1373
01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:46.610
<v Speaker 3>That's what we've been doing with her religious stories since the beginning of</v>

1374
01:00:46.611 --> 01:00:47.444
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1375
01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:50.750
<v Speaker 3>We'd be watching how we behave.</v>

1376
01:00:51.170 --> 01:00:56.050
<v Speaker 3>We've been extracting out the patterns of that application and we'd be presented</v>

1377
01:00:56.170 --> 01:01:01.070
<v Speaker 3>in dramatic form and those stories are at the bottom of our cognitive</v>

1378
01:01:01.071 --> 01:01:01.904
<v Speaker 3>architecture.</v>

1379
01:01:02.190 --> 01:01:03.090
<v Speaker 3>That's what are,</v>

1380
01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:04.300
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1381
01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:09.020
<v Speaker 3>it's within that structure that our worldviews rests and that is roughly</v>

1382
01:01:09.021 --> 01:01:09.621
<v Speaker 3>speaking.</v>

1383
01:01:09.621 --> 01:01:14.621
<v Speaker 3>It's the drama of good versus evil on the landscape of chaos versus order.</v>

1384
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:18.710
<v Speaker 3>Order be that place that you're familiar with and comfortable with.</v>

1385
01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:19.550
<v Speaker 3>The home,</v>

1386
01:01:19.550 --> 01:01:20.121
<v Speaker 3>the hearth,</v>

1387
01:01:20.121 --> 01:01:20.661
<v Speaker 3>the family,</v>

1388
01:01:20.661 --> 01:01:21.494
<v Speaker 3>the country,</v>

1389
01:01:21.530 --> 01:01:22.340
<v Speaker 3>the state,</v>

1390
01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:23.900
<v Speaker 3>the well organized community,</v>

1391
01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:25.490
<v Speaker 3>the gated community,</v>

1392
01:01:25.550 --> 01:01:26.780
<v Speaker 3>the walled city,</v>

1393
01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:28.620
<v Speaker 3>the places that people have always lived.</v>

1394
01:01:28.790 --> 01:01:30.740
<v Speaker 3>And then what's the upside of that?</v>

1395
01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:32.120
<v Speaker 3>And that's our reality.</v>

1396
01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:34.580
<v Speaker 3>That's the landscape within math.</v>

1397
01:01:34.581 --> 01:01:38.690
<v Speaker 3>There's a drama group versus succeed and that's our fundamental religious</v>

1398
01:01:38.691 --> 01:01:40.100
<v Speaker 3>conception of the world.</v>

1399
01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:41.001
<v Speaker 3>And you might take,</v>

1400
01:01:41.001 --> 01:01:42.950
<v Speaker 3>well you don't believe in that,</v>

1401
01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:44.300
<v Speaker 3>but that's not true.</v>

1402
01:01:44.810 --> 01:01:47.060
<v Speaker 3>You do believe in that because if you didn't believe in it,</v>

1403
01:01:47.061 --> 01:01:48.290
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't be human.</v>

1404
01:01:48.770 --> 01:01:51.740
<v Speaker 3>To be human is to live in that world.</v>

1405
01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:52.910
<v Speaker 3>Now what that means,</v>

1406
01:01:52.911 --> 01:01:55.030
<v Speaker 3>metaphysically is very difficult to say.</v>

1407
01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:55.821
<v Speaker 3>It has played out.</v>

1408
01:01:55.821 --> 01:01:56.810
<v Speaker 3>Support is reality.</v>

1409
01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:57.800
<v Speaker 3>Actually.</v>

1410
01:01:57.860 --> 01:02:00.180
<v Speaker 3>Chaos versus order with address,</v>

1411
01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:02.380
<v Speaker 3>amount of good and evil being played down in nap.</v>

1412
01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:04.460
<v Speaker 3>And that's a very difficult question to answer,</v>

1413
01:02:04.461 --> 01:02:09.350
<v Speaker 3>but one thing I can tell you is that you act like it is and your brain is</v>

1414
01:02:09.410 --> 01:02:11.150
<v Speaker 3>organized like idiots.</v>

1415
01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:15.050
<v Speaker 3>And so that's pretty powerful evidence that there's something going on that's</v>

1416
01:02:15.051 --> 01:02:18.560
<v Speaker 3>vaguely related to reality and not just to imagination.</v>

1417
01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:21.653
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1418
01:02:27.130 --> 01:02:31.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to tell you if you're a sequence of very old stories and then I'm</v>

1419
01:02:31.511 --> 01:02:36.160
<v Speaker 3>going to tell you about why don't related to mass murderers,</v>

1420
01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:37.900
<v Speaker 3>because I already said that.</v>

1421
01:02:37.901 --> 01:02:39.850
<v Speaker 3>If you want to answer that most difficult question,</v>

1422
01:02:39.851 --> 01:02:44.560
<v Speaker 3>you have to go to the deepest possible level and the deepest possible level</v>

1423
01:02:44.860 --> 01:02:46.000
<v Speaker 3>isn't what you know.</v>

1424
01:02:46.001 --> 01:02:51.001
<v Speaker 3>You know it's what you act out and maybe it's what you start to represent it,</v>

1425
01:02:52.210 --> 01:02:53.650
<v Speaker 3>but you don't know what it is yet.</v>

1426
01:02:53.651 --> 01:02:54.940
<v Speaker 3>It's too profound.</v>

1427
01:02:54.941 --> 01:02:58.420
<v Speaker 3>Needs to be visible in some sense to be partner,</v>

1428
01:02:58.450 --> 01:02:59.780
<v Speaker 3>fully articulate knowledge.</v>

1429
01:02:59.980 --> 01:03:01.060
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that,</v>

1430
01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:01.281
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>

1431
01:03:01.281 --> 01:03:03.880
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that cardio was attempted to do,</v>

1432
01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:05.513
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

1433
01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:07.463
<v Speaker 1>I think he was,</v>

1434
01:03:08.010 --> 01:03:10.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if he was the greatest thinker of the 20th century,</v>

1435
01:03:10.381 --> 01:03:11.670
<v Speaker 3>but he certainly,</v>

1436
01:03:12.210 --> 01:03:17.210
<v Speaker 3>he was certainly up there and I'll tell you what he was up when he took Freud's</v>

1437
01:03:18.121 --> 01:03:23.121
<v Speaker 3>idea that you could look at fantasy and extract out new.</v>

1438
01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:25.200
<v Speaker 3>Nolan took that idea seriously.</v>

1439
01:03:25.201 --> 01:03:25.861
<v Speaker 3>And then he thought,</v>

1440
01:03:25.861 --> 01:03:26.610
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1441
01:03:26.610 --> 01:03:30.090
<v Speaker 3>dreams that people have in the fantasies they have are like the mythologies that</v>

1442
01:03:30.091 --> 01:03:31.530
<v Speaker 3>they use in their culture.</v>

1443
01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:33.690
<v Speaker 3>So the dream is to the individual,</v>

1444
01:03:33.691 --> 01:03:38.520
<v Speaker 3>like the myth is to the culture and you believe that we existed within Stuart's.</v>

1445
01:03:38.521 --> 01:03:39.031
<v Speaker 3>If we've been,</v>

1446
01:03:39.031 --> 01:03:39.864
<v Speaker 3>I'd describe it.</v>

1447
01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:41.700
<v Speaker 3>And I think the evidence for that by the way,</v>

1448
01:03:41.701 --> 01:03:43.370
<v Speaker 3>is incontrovertibly Kenny,</v>

1449
01:03:43.410 --> 01:03:48.410
<v Speaker 3>serious psychologist who knows anything about how the brain functions in any</v>

1450
01:03:50.041 --> 01:03:52.740
<v Speaker 3>deep sense is destiny.</v>

1451
01:03:53.070 --> 01:03:57.300
<v Speaker 3>Admit that the manner in which we construct the world looks like a narrative.</v>

1452
01:03:57.910 --> 01:03:59.180
<v Speaker 3>Now had not everyone who raised me,</v>

1453
01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:01.710
<v Speaker 3>the psychologist that I've come across.</v>

1454
01:04:01.711 --> 01:04:06.210
<v Speaker 3>So I think are the deepest of thinkers have have drawn that conclusion.</v>

1455
01:04:06.211 --> 01:04:08.100
<v Speaker 3>And why did disparate fields,</v>

1456
01:04:08.270 --> 01:04:08.550
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1457
01:04:08.550 --> 01:04:12.020
<v Speaker 3>Ranging from artificial intelligence to the analysis of dreams.</v>

1458
01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:13.910
<v Speaker 3>It's something that's emerged cross this.</v>

1459
01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:24.710
<v Speaker 3>So here's where it was up to the first page.</v>

1460
01:04:26.890 --> 01:04:27.291
<v Speaker 1>Pause it.</v>

1461
01:04:27.291 --> 01:04:29.130
<v Speaker 1>That was what I just told you about.</v>

1462
01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:32.880
<v Speaker 3>It's an extension of Freud's vision of treatments.</v>

1463
01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:36.680
<v Speaker 3>The second idea was that park,</v>

1464
01:04:36.850 --> 01:04:38.350
<v Speaker 3>the way they think about the world,</v>

1465
01:04:38.351 --> 01:04:39.790
<v Speaker 3>is it banding stories?</v>

1466
01:04:43.250 --> 01:04:48.250
<v Speaker 3>Third idea was that these stories were deeply reflective of who we are and I'm</v>

1467
01:04:49.151 --> 01:04:50.030
<v Speaker 3>only culturally,</v>

1468
01:04:50.031 --> 01:04:53.960
<v Speaker 3>but in the deepest possible biological sense.</v>

1469
01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:59.320
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't merely armature socio-cultural structure and I also think the evidence</v>

1470
01:04:59.841 --> 01:05:02.840
<v Speaker 3>for that is overwhelming and crystal court.</v>

1471
01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:04.160
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

1472
01:05:04.910 --> 01:05:09.910
<v Speaker 3>our fundamental biology is very much like that of the fundamental biology of</v>

1473
01:05:10.250 --> 01:05:10.890
<v Speaker 3>animals,</v>

1474
01:05:10.890 --> 01:05:11.361
<v Speaker 3>mammals,</v>

1475
01:05:11.361 --> 01:05:12.194
<v Speaker 3>social mammals,</v>

1476
01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:14.180
<v Speaker 3>the drugs that work on us,</v>

1477
01:05:15.110 --> 01:05:18.220
<v Speaker 3>the site of the drugs that work psychologically a to have very similar effects</v>

1478
01:05:18.221 --> 01:05:19.990
<v Speaker 3>on animals like rats for example.</v>

1479
01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:24.070
<v Speaker 3>We share biological history with that</v>

1480
01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:31.990
<v Speaker 3>and to think about us as some divorced from our biological fundamental is</v>

1481
01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:33.853
<v Speaker 3>illusory.</v>

1482
01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:35.113
<v Speaker 3>You know that,</v>

1483
01:05:35.630 --> 01:05:38.720
<v Speaker 3>you know that might what you don't have to be talking about when you talk to</v>

1484
01:05:38.721 --> 01:05:38.991
<v Speaker 3>someone,</v>

1485
01:05:38.991 --> 01:05:41.120
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to talk about what anger is.</v>

1486
01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:43.030
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to talk about what fear is.</v>

1487
01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:46.010
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to talk about with jealousy is you don't have to talk about what</v>

1488
01:05:46.011 --> 01:05:46.810
<v Speaker 3>Hungary's.</v>

1489
01:05:46.810 --> 01:05:48.770
<v Speaker 3>You might describe your particular hunger,</v>

1490
01:05:48.771 --> 01:05:52.340
<v Speaker 3>but you don't have to make a case for the existence of hunger,</v>

1491
01:05:52.550 --> 01:05:53.000
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1492
01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:57.080
<v Speaker 3>There's all these fundamental human experiences that are part and parcel of</v>

1493
01:05:57.081 --> 01:05:57.891
<v Speaker 3>being embodied.</v>

1494
01:05:57.891 --> 01:06:01.400
<v Speaker 3>In the manner that one boy that are beyond discussion,</v>

1495
01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:04.560
<v Speaker 3>it's so self evident like pain is one you don't,</v>

1496
01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:09.760
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to convince someone else of the existence of pain or the</v>

1497
01:06:10.091 --> 01:06:10.551
<v Speaker 3>suffering.</v>

1498
01:06:10.551 --> 01:06:14.690
<v Speaker 3>I think this particularly alcohol in that regard and so we have those</v>

1499
01:06:14.691 --> 01:06:17.750
<v Speaker 3>fundamental ways of orienting ourselves to the world that are deeply rooted</v>

1500
01:06:17.751 --> 01:06:21.410
<v Speaker 3>biologically make manifest themselves in our stories and that makes up part of</v>

1501
01:06:21.411 --> 01:06:24.710
<v Speaker 3>our nature and we have to figure out how to cope with those fundamental</v>

1502
01:06:24.711 --> 01:06:29.120
<v Speaker 3>realities of life and the way we do that just by learning to act in particular</v>

1503
01:06:29.121 --> 01:06:31.060
<v Speaker 3>ways in the world are there.</v>

1504
01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:32.240
<v Speaker 3>You can strange ways,</v>

1505
01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:33.500
<v Speaker 3>which I'll just go sit at the moment.</v>

1506
01:06:58.060 --> 01:07:03.060
<v Speaker 3>I just made the case that we live in a metaphysical store and then in fact the</v>

1507
01:07:04.481 --> 01:07:08.860
<v Speaker 3>kind of reality now what seems to have happened to us that over the last 500</v>

1508
01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:10.270
<v Speaker 3>years or something like that,</v>

1509
01:07:10.450 --> 01:07:13.570
<v Speaker 3>we invented a new way of looking at the world.</v>

1510
01:07:13.620 --> 01:07:18.620
<v Speaker 3>That's a materialistic view site and that is exactly the view of story.</v>

1511
01:07:19.570 --> 01:07:20.650
<v Speaker 3>It's different than that.</v>

1512
01:07:21.250 --> 01:07:26.250
<v Speaker 3>It's a new technology and the problem seems to be that the emergence of that</v>

1513
01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:30.640
<v Speaker 3>which has made us wealthy and to take the Lord's will be powerful,</v>

1514
01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:37.400
<v Speaker 3>doesn't seem to fundamental way meditative subarc basic story.</v>

1515
01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:40.640
<v Speaker 3>Neat.</v>

1516
01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:45.640
<v Speaker 3>You have this idea in the league 19 hundreds and hundreds that the conflict</v>

1517
01:07:47.951 --> 01:07:52.390
<v Speaker 3>between the scientific world view and the religious worldview had decimated.</v>

1518
01:07:52.420 --> 01:07:53.320
<v Speaker 3>They just will do it.</v>

1519
01:07:55.150 --> 01:07:59.300
<v Speaker 3>Can you describe that as the definite goal and he believed that because of that</v>

1520
01:07:59.301 --> 01:07:59.751
<v Speaker 3>had happened,</v>

1521
01:07:59.751 --> 01:08:03.680
<v Speaker 3>we had lost our moorings for ethical mornings and that our society is going to</v>

1522
01:08:03.681 --> 01:08:04.191
<v Speaker 3>lost lake.</v>

1523
01:08:04.191 --> 01:08:07.220
<v Speaker 3>Very bad men between nihilism and totalitarianism as a console.</v>

1524
01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:08.930
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1525
01:08:08.930 --> 01:08:09.270
<v Speaker 3>neat.</v>

1526
01:08:09.270 --> 01:08:13.650
<v Speaker 3>You died quite young believe that in order to recover from that and find our</v>

1527
01:08:13.651 --> 01:08:14.484
<v Speaker 3>bearings again,</v>

1528
01:08:14.670 --> 01:08:19.250
<v Speaker 3>that we going to have to replace the gods that we once believed in.</v>

1529
01:08:19.251 --> 01:08:19.671
<v Speaker 3>Let's say,</v>

1530
01:08:19.671 --> 01:08:23.450
<v Speaker 3>are you caught up and wants to plead it with some notion of our own divinity?</v>

1531
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:26.630
<v Speaker 3>Take responsibility for creating our own doubters?</v>

1532
01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:28.700
<v Speaker 3>That was his idea of the superman.</v>

1533
01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:31.890
<v Speaker 3>The Overman Yeoman was very interested in.</v>

1534
01:08:31.891 --> 01:08:36.170
<v Speaker 3>He just stopped coming because he knew that we lived inside stories and the</v>

1535
01:08:36.171 --> 01:08:40.340
<v Speaker 3>stories had certain actions of value and then our faith and our fundamental</v>

1536
01:08:40.341 --> 01:08:41.480
<v Speaker 3>story had been shaken,</v>

1537
01:08:41.481 --> 01:08:43.010
<v Speaker 3>not least by our scientific,</v>

1538
01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:44.690
<v Speaker 3>the rising of the scientific knowledge,</v>

1539
01:08:45.230 --> 01:08:49.040
<v Speaker 3>and he was interested in trying to figure out how people might find themselves</v>

1540
01:08:49.041 --> 01:08:51.740
<v Speaker 3>reoriented so they didn't turn to nihilism,</v>

1541
01:08:51.741 --> 01:08:52.161
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

1542
01:08:52.161 --> 01:08:54.520
<v Speaker 3>or two to tell interi utopian world news,</v>

1543
01:08:54.530 --> 01:08:56.930
<v Speaker 3>but put themselves back in the story.</v>

1544
01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:02.200
<v Speaker 3>But he didn't buy the niches prognosis for cure because yoga was influenced by</v>

1545
01:09:03.981 --> 01:09:06.770
<v Speaker 3>Freud and Freud and pointed out that</v>

1546
01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:10.430
<v Speaker 3>people didn't create their own values.</v>

1547
01:09:11.210 --> 01:09:15.830
<v Speaker 3>You can't do that because you have nature and the nature manifests itself within</v>

1548
01:09:15.831 --> 01:09:18.770
<v Speaker 3>you regardless of your choice.</v>

1549
01:09:19.170 --> 01:09:24.170
<v Speaker 3>There's things that you can't get yourself to do and you know that,</v>

1550
01:09:24.501 --> 01:09:24.711
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1551
01:09:24.711 --> 01:09:26.960
<v Speaker 3>Because there's a matter of creating your own values.</v>

1552
01:09:26.961 --> 01:09:27.471
<v Speaker 3>You just think,</v>

1553
01:09:27.471 --> 01:09:27.591
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1554
01:09:27.591 --> 01:09:30.800
<v Speaker 3>you would wake up one morning and you could just tell yourself what to do.</v>

1555
01:09:30.830 --> 01:09:31.700
<v Speaker 3>Like go to the gym two,</v>

1556
01:09:31.730 --> 01:09:33.950
<v Speaker 3>three times a week so that you know you're in good shape,</v>

1557
01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:36.980
<v Speaker 3>stopped eating junk or quit drinking and bang,</v>

1558
01:09:36.981 --> 01:09:39.770
<v Speaker 3>you just kill it because you've got control over yourself.</v>

1559
01:09:39.771 --> 01:09:44.771
<v Speaker 3>And well obviously that's just not the case and that's because there are all</v>

1560
01:09:44.871 --> 01:09:48.530
<v Speaker 3>sorts of things operating inside of you that have their own autonomy and their</v>

1561
01:09:48.531 --> 01:09:51.710
<v Speaker 3>own nature that you've Lenny will have to contend with.</v>

1562
01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:55.310
<v Speaker 3>And so that's why you went back inside the human psyche,</v>

1563
01:09:55.311 --> 01:09:56.300
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>

1564
01:09:56.360 --> 01:10:00.590
<v Speaker 3>to look at the fantasies that we spontaneously generated as a Greek myths of the</v>

1565
01:10:00.591 --> 01:10:01.160
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

1566
01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:04.030
<v Speaker 3>to see if he could find out what the pattern constituted.</v>

1567
01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:06.693
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>

1568
01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:09.060
<v Speaker 3>now I'm going to tell you this little story.</v>

1569
01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:12.470
<v Speaker 3>So this is the idea is that this is partly,</v>

1570
01:10:12.650 --> 01:10:17.650
<v Speaker 3>these stories are partly derived from thousands or even Ken out tens of</v>

1571
01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:23.570
<v Speaker 3>thousands of years of watching how people act to successfully and unsuccessfully</v>

1572
01:10:23.571 --> 01:10:26.140
<v Speaker 3>in the world and extracting overpass.</v>

1573
01:10:27.110 --> 01:10:27.943
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

1574
01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:30.140
<v Speaker 3>and has the patterns get extracted,</v>

1575
01:10:30.141 --> 01:10:32.270
<v Speaker 3>they get more abstract and they get,</v>

1576
01:10:32.570 --> 01:10:36.080
<v Speaker 3>I think it less real in some sense that they get more broadly applicable.</v>

1577
01:10:36.081 --> 01:10:38.420
<v Speaker 3>So let me tell you first story.</v>

1578
01:10:38.430 --> 01:10:40.550
<v Speaker 3>So this is from the opening chapter,</v>

1579
01:10:40.610 --> 01:10:41.780
<v Speaker 3>opening parts of Genesis.</v>

1580
01:10:41.790 --> 01:10:43.310
<v Speaker 3>So there's an idea in genesis.</v>

1581
01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:48.680
<v Speaker 3>This is roughly how the idea is laid out and it's an idea that's expressed it.</v>

1582
01:10:48.710 --> 01:10:50.720
<v Speaker 3>It tells you all over the world in different forms.</v>

1583
01:10:50.890 --> 01:10:54.950
<v Speaker 3>And so the first time he hit me is that there's sorts of domains or fee.</v>

1584
01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:59.870
<v Speaker 3>There's potential chaos and there's order having a more,</v>

1585
01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:00.381
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1586
01:11:00.381 --> 01:11:01.310
<v Speaker 3>now that's,</v>

1587
01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:02.180
<v Speaker 3>that's the,</v>

1588
01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:04.040
<v Speaker 3>that's the structure of reality.</v>

1589
01:11:04.190 --> 01:11:05.990
<v Speaker 3>It's like the Dow was given Yay.</v>

1590
01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:10.760
<v Speaker 3>It's the same thing that you're hemispheres are mapping order and chaos.</v>

1591
01:11:10.761 --> 01:11:12.290
<v Speaker 3>And that's what the world's made of.</v>

1592
01:11:12.860 --> 01:11:13.270
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1593
01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:17.490
<v Speaker 3>There's a third founder and the third factor is the thing he mediated between</v>

1594
01:11:17.491 --> 01:11:18.324
<v Speaker 3>those two.</v>

1595
01:11:18.510 --> 01:11:19.470
<v Speaker 3>And that would be,</v>

1596
01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:24.540
<v Speaker 3>that's what people mean when they talk about consciousness is that seems to be</v>

1597
01:11:24.691 --> 01:11:25.800
<v Speaker 3>what consciousness does.</v>

1598
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:28.290
<v Speaker 3>Consciousness establishes order,</v>

1599
01:11:28.291 --> 01:11:29.124
<v Speaker 3>your conscious,</v>

1600
01:11:29.130 --> 01:11:30.210
<v Speaker 3>you make decisions,</v>

1601
01:11:30.270 --> 01:11:31.200
<v Speaker 3>you make it a world.</v>

1602
01:11:32.190 --> 01:11:34.340
<v Speaker 3>But while you're being conscious and attempted,</v>

1603
01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:37.390
<v Speaker 3>you're attending to what you don't yet understand and haven't her.</v>

1604
01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:42.030
<v Speaker 3>And so you're faced with some known and potential and you transform that</v>

1605
01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:47.120
<v Speaker 3>effortfully and carefully is what you understand what you couldn't have that.</v>

1606
01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:48.750
<v Speaker 3>So that's what your consciousness does.</v>

1607
01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:49.830
<v Speaker 3>And the Genesis,</v>

1608
01:11:49.831 --> 01:11:50.870
<v Speaker 3>you see that portrayed,</v>

1609
01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:54.570
<v Speaker 3>you see that portrayed as something that's defined as a divine spirit.</v>

1610
01:11:54.930 --> 01:11:57.920
<v Speaker 3>So that's basically Jajuan yellows,</v>

1611
01:11:57.960 --> 01:11:58.620
<v Speaker 3>y'all was,</v>

1612
01:11:58.620 --> 01:11:59.371
<v Speaker 3>what would you call it,</v>

1613
01:11:59.371 --> 01:12:00.660
<v Speaker 3>the process by which you all,</v>

1614
01:12:00.661 --> 01:12:03.150
<v Speaker 3>what generates the world has been terminated.</v>

1615
01:12:03.180 --> 01:12:07.680
<v Speaker 3>This is the Christianization of that story is the term the logos and the logos</v>

1616
01:12:07.681 --> 01:12:09.720
<v Speaker 3>is the capacity for attentive,</v>

1617
01:12:09.870 --> 01:12:10.770
<v Speaker 3>communicative,</v>

1618
01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:12.570
<v Speaker 3>truthful speech.</v>

1619
01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:15.660
<v Speaker 3>And so there's a deep idea at the beginning of genesis step,</v>

1620
01:12:17.670 --> 01:12:22.670
<v Speaker 3>whatever divine consciousness is that which uses trinkled communicated speech to</v>

1621
01:12:23.250 --> 01:12:28.240
<v Speaker 3>encounter the chaos of the unknown and to transform it to happen board.</v>

1622
01:12:28.870 --> 01:12:32.760
<v Speaker 3>And so that's a technical description of the structure of reality.</v>

1623
01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:35.220
<v Speaker 3>And it's an ethical injunction as well.</v>

1624
01:12:35.221 --> 01:12:38.970
<v Speaker 3>Because what happens in the will in chapters of genesis is that God uses the</v>

1625
01:12:38.971 --> 01:12:42.390
<v Speaker 3>logos to create the world out of that preexisted chaos.</v>

1626
01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:43.500
<v Speaker 3>And He,</v>

1627
01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:45.600
<v Speaker 3>and when he does that in stages,</v>

1628
01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:47.670
<v Speaker 3>he pronounces it good.</v>

1629
01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:50.440
<v Speaker 3>And so there's an idea there are deep it.</v>

1630
01:12:51.940 --> 01:12:52.510
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

1631
01:12:52.510 --> 01:12:56.690
<v Speaker 3>You need idea because one of the things you might ask yourself,</v>

1632
01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:01.230
<v Speaker 3>and this is one of the things that the mass murderers asking themselves all the</v>

1633
01:13:01.231 --> 01:13:02.064
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

1634
01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:07.400
<v Speaker 3>is being justifiable or is it something against which you should strive and to</v>

1635
01:13:09.101 --> 01:13:09.934
<v Speaker 3>destroy?</v>

1636
01:13:10.710 --> 01:13:13.740
<v Speaker 3>And that's a very good question because life is very,</v>

1637
01:13:13.741 --> 01:13:16.920
<v Speaker 3>very difficult and it's full of suffering and it's full of betrayal and it's</v>

1638
01:13:16.921 --> 01:13:21.780
<v Speaker 3>full of malevolence and it's not an unreasonable proposition.</v>

1639
01:13:21.781 --> 01:13:26.580
<v Speaker 3>He question whether it would be better if you're not thinking at all sisters and</v>

1640
01:13:26.581 --> 01:13:30.630
<v Speaker 3>the people who take the steps to doing the terrible things that they ended up</v>

1641
01:13:30.631 --> 01:13:31.200
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>

1642
01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:33.150
<v Speaker 3>Answer that question in the affirmative,</v>

1643
01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:36.480
<v Speaker 3>they believe that life itself is so unbearable.</v>

1644
01:13:36.481 --> 01:13:39.870
<v Speaker 3>It was fucking mental structure that normally should not exist,</v>

1645
01:13:39.871 --> 01:13:44.400
<v Speaker 3>but at the right response to it is to take revenge against the fact that its</v>

1646
01:13:44.401 --> 01:13:45.450
<v Speaker 3>existence.</v>

1647
01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:50.700
<v Speaker 3>And that's part of the answer to how you get to where you have to go.</v>

1648
01:13:50.730 --> 01:13:54.000
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to rent a van and drive it for camp blocks on a city,</v>

1649
01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:55.350
<v Speaker 3>on city sidewalks,</v>

1650
01:13:55.950 --> 01:13:56.870
<v Speaker 3>it's a deep,</v>

1651
01:13:56.871 --> 01:13:58.860
<v Speaker 3>deep problem and it's justifiable.</v>

1652
01:13:59.130 --> 01:14:02.280
<v Speaker 3>But the hypothesis it's laid out in genesis,</v>

1653
01:14:02.281 --> 01:14:03.960
<v Speaker 3>which is an amazing hypothesis,</v>

1654
01:14:04.110 --> 01:14:09.110
<v Speaker 3>is that despite the fragility of the world and the vulnerability of the world</v>

1655
01:14:09.330 --> 01:14:10.380
<v Speaker 3>and it's a proclivity,</v>

1656
01:14:10.381 --> 01:14:11.890
<v Speaker 3>let's say towards malevolence,</v>

1657
01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:16.630
<v Speaker 3>if you encountered with consciousness encounters with the potential that the</v>

1658
01:14:16.631 --> 01:14:20.140
<v Speaker 3>world is extracted from Eddie does that truthfully,</v>

1659
01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:25.320
<v Speaker 3>then what is created as a consequence is good and I would say that's the host.</v>

1660
01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:29.350
<v Speaker 3>That's the most fundamental act of faith and I think that's the fundamental</v>

1661
01:14:29.351 --> 01:14:31.030
<v Speaker 3>ethical question that lies,</v>

1662
01:14:31.370 --> 01:14:35.410
<v Speaker 3>that underlies the entire Corpus of the stories of what which our culture and</v>

1663
01:14:35.411 --> 01:14:38.590
<v Speaker 3>all phones predicate question is,</v>

1664
01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:43.990
<v Speaker 3>are you really to act out the proposition that he is good if you abide by the</v>

1665
01:14:43.991 --> 01:14:48.160
<v Speaker 3>truth and what's interesting is that it's an existential question,</v>

1666
01:14:48.161 --> 01:14:48.851
<v Speaker 3>Nate.</v>

1667
01:14:48.851 --> 01:14:53.020
<v Speaker 3>It's not a question that you can that can be answered by fact because no one can</v>

1668
01:14:53.021 --> 01:14:55.180
<v Speaker 3>prove it to you because they can't,</v>

1669
01:14:55.660 --> 01:14:58.900
<v Speaker 3>they can't tell you what your life is going to be like if you do that because</v>

1670
01:14:58.901 --> 01:14:59.200
<v Speaker 3>you could.</v>

1671
01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:00.940
<v Speaker 3>You're the only person that can find out.</v>

1672
01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:04.960
<v Speaker 3>And the only way you can find out essentially by risking everything you can</v>

1673
01:15:04.961 --> 01:15:05.351
<v Speaker 3>decide,</v>

1674
01:15:05.351 --> 01:15:05.471
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1675
01:15:05.471 --> 01:15:08.590
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to separate proposition.</v>

1676
01:15:08.591 --> 01:15:13.090
<v Speaker 3>That truthful being is that being that producers what's good and then I'm going</v>

1677
01:15:13.091 --> 01:15:13.870
<v Speaker 3>to abide by that,</v>

1678
01:15:13.870 --> 01:15:17.890
<v Speaker 3>but then strange things will happen to you because it isn't necessarily the case</v>

1679
01:15:17.891 --> 01:15:21.280
<v Speaker 3>that if you attempt to abide by your own truth,</v>

1680
01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:26.440
<v Speaker 3>that everything that happens to every second is going to be demonstrative proof</v>

1681
01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:27.940
<v Speaker 3>that that's the right pathway.</v>

1682
01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:31.510
<v Speaker 3>You'd beat yourself in all sorts of trouble if you knew that you know that</v>

1683
01:15:31.511 --> 01:15:34.930
<v Speaker 3>perfectly well because there's uncomfortable conversations that you should</v>

1684
01:15:34.931 --> 01:15:38.770
<v Speaker 3>probably have a few people and if you have those uncomfortable conversations,</v>

1685
01:15:38.771 --> 01:15:39.580
<v Speaker 3>it's not like there's big,</v>

1686
01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:41.920
<v Speaker 3>it's just going to be roses and sunshine rather.</v>

1687
01:15:41.921 --> 01:15:42.360
<v Speaker 3>You're happy.</v>

1688
01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:43.193
<v Speaker 3>The discussion,</v>

1689
01:15:43.330 --> 01:15:44.350
<v Speaker 3>quite the contrary.</v>

1690
01:15:44.830 --> 01:15:47.290
<v Speaker 3>The truth is a very disruptive force,</v>

1691
01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:50.410
<v Speaker 3>especially people that are living inside an illusion.</v>

1692
01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:52.380
<v Speaker 3>And so it is is,</v>

1693
01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:53.231
<v Speaker 3>it's a statement.</v>

1694
01:15:53.231 --> 01:15:56.320
<v Speaker 3>It's an if it's a metaphysical statement of faith.</v>

1695
01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:59.320
<v Speaker 3>Now this story for aggressive,</v>

1696
01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:01.840
<v Speaker 3>so godleys of the world,</v>

1697
01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:05.620
<v Speaker 3>but it's not the material world is the world that I just described as the world</v>

1698
01:16:05.621 --> 01:16:07.540
<v Speaker 3>of chaos and order and good and evil</v>

1699
01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:15.320
<v Speaker 3>and the historic,</v>

1700
01:16:15.350 --> 01:16:18.640
<v Speaker 3>just two creation stories in genesis and they actually come from slightly</v>

1701
01:16:18.641 --> 01:16:21.700
<v Speaker 3>different conditions that people who put the books together and try to,</v>

1702
01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:25.780
<v Speaker 3>they were probably from different tribes and the tribes came together.</v>

1703
01:16:25.780 --> 01:16:28.720
<v Speaker 3>They had to integrate the stories because otherwise the tribes would fight and</v>

1704
01:16:28.740 --> 01:16:32.530
<v Speaker 3>the Bible is actually a consequence of the integration of tribal stories across</v>

1705
01:16:32.531 --> 01:16:35.050
<v Speaker 3>thousands of years and they're not integrated perfectly,</v>

1706
01:16:35.051 --> 01:16:38.230
<v Speaker 3>which is why there are conceptual contradictions in the Bible.</v>

1707
01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:38.591
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't,</v>

1708
01:16:38.591 --> 01:16:41.890
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter because the pattern,</v>

1709
01:16:41.950 --> 01:16:46.540
<v Speaker 3>the pattern Rene's constantly across the conceptual error daughters,</v>

1710
01:16:47.530 --> 01:16:49.210
<v Speaker 3>the second creation story,</v>

1711
01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:52.330
<v Speaker 3>it's the story of how he is actually older than the first one,</v>

1712
01:16:52.780 --> 01:16:56.710
<v Speaker 3>but it was placed by whoever edited the Bible second because that was a way of</v>

1713
01:16:56.711 --> 01:16:58.940
<v Speaker 3>making a narrative some more coherently.</v>

1714
01:16:59.170 --> 01:17:03.690
<v Speaker 3>What happens in the second story's this go out.</v>

1715
01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:05.230
<v Speaker 3>He's already created Cosmo,</v>

1716
01:17:05.310 --> 01:17:05.771
<v Speaker 3>let's say no,</v>

1717
01:17:05.771 --> 01:17:08.140
<v Speaker 3>he makes the habitable place for human beings.</v>

1718
01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:09.500
<v Speaker 3>And that's a Gardner.</v>

1719
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:11.150
<v Speaker 3>So that's paradise.</v>

1720
01:17:11.210 --> 01:17:14.570
<v Speaker 3>It's paradise is a walled garden or eating,</v>

1721
01:17:14.571 --> 01:17:16.580
<v Speaker 3>which needs well watering space.</v>

1722
01:17:16.630 --> 01:17:21.380
<v Speaker 3>And so the idea is that the proper environment for you human ne is a wall</v>

1723
01:17:21.410 --> 01:17:22.243
<v Speaker 3>enclosure.</v>

1724
01:17:22.380 --> 01:17:23.213
<v Speaker 3>That's well water.</v>

1725
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:27.140
<v Speaker 3>And there's a mythological id on that because what's a garden?</v>

1726
01:17:27.850 --> 01:17:30.410
<v Speaker 3>A garden is nature and culture together.</v>

1727
01:17:30.730 --> 01:17:31.640
<v Speaker 3>It proper union,</v>

1728
01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:31.940
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1729
01:17:31.940 --> 01:17:35.630
<v Speaker 3>Because obviously the nature is the plants and the growth and the culture is the</v>

1730
01:17:35.631 --> 01:17:39.470
<v Speaker 3>tending that it takes to make that the proper place for human beings to live.</v>

1731
01:17:39.471 --> 01:17:40.670
<v Speaker 3>So there's chaos.</v>

1732
01:17:40.671 --> 01:17:42.050
<v Speaker 3>Order Echo there.</v>

1733
01:17:42.170 --> 01:17:43.660
<v Speaker 3>Chaos being nature in order,</v>

1734
01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:44.513
<v Speaker 3>big culture,</v>

1735
01:17:44.630 --> 01:17:46.290
<v Speaker 3>that's the proper environment for human beings.</v>

1736
01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:49.020
<v Speaker 3>It has to be wall because well,</v>

1737
01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:51.770
<v Speaker 3>you have to live with a wool environment,</v>

1738
01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:52.633
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1739
01:17:53.180 --> 01:17:54.020
<v Speaker 3>Your house,</v>

1740
01:17:54.050 --> 01:17:55.280
<v Speaker 3>your roots have walls,</v>

1741
01:17:55.281 --> 01:17:57.290
<v Speaker 3>your houses have walls,</v>

1742
01:17:57.650 --> 01:17:59.630
<v Speaker 3>your cities are pounding,</v>

1743
01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:01.670
<v Speaker 3>your states have boundaries.</v>

1744
01:18:01.671 --> 01:18:03.440
<v Speaker 3>Your countries have borders.</v>

1745
01:18:03.530 --> 01:18:04.540
<v Speaker 3>It's woefully thing.</v>

1746
01:18:04.541 --> 01:18:05.640
<v Speaker 3>Bowls with the mold.</v>

1747
01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:06.501
<v Speaker 3>And you need that.</v>

1748
01:18:06.501 --> 01:18:06.831
<v Speaker 3>Pardon me?</v>

1749
01:18:06.831 --> 01:18:10.520
<v Speaker 3>Because there isn't that much of you and you have to wall over a tremendous</v>

1750
01:18:10.521 --> 01:18:12.620
<v Speaker 3>amount of complexity in order to survive.</v>

1751
01:18:13.780 --> 01:18:15.410
<v Speaker 3>The gardener who go ahead,</v>

1752
01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:19.000
<v Speaker 3>which men and women there and he says to them,</v>

1753
01:18:20.190 --> 01:18:21.460
<v Speaker 3>you can do whatever you want to garden,</v>

1754
01:18:21.461 --> 01:18:24.910
<v Speaker 3>but there's a tree in the middle of the garden and it has the fruit of the</v>

1755
01:18:24.911 --> 01:18:28.960
<v Speaker 3>knowledge of good and evil on an end you're not to touch that.</v>

1756
01:18:30.010 --> 01:18:32.840
<v Speaker 3>And so that's a very curious thing.</v>

1757
01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:35.930
<v Speaker 3>First curious questioning his wife and the damn tree again.</v>

1758
01:18:36.670 --> 01:18:40.510
<v Speaker 3>And the second day is what the hell's going expect to be told people not to pass</v>

1759
01:18:40.511 --> 01:18:41.081
<v Speaker 3>with that tree.</v>

1760
01:18:41.081 --> 01:18:44.020
<v Speaker 3>Because the first thing that would happen when she told people not to do that is</v>

1761
01:18:44.021 --> 01:18:45.280
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly what they would do.</v>

1762
01:18:45.281 --> 01:18:46.570
<v Speaker 3>Cause that's exactly what we're like.</v>

1763
01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:48.033
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1764
01:18:51.770 --> 01:18:54.800
<v Speaker 3>eve is tempted by the snake and she eats the apple</v>

1765
01:18:56.570 --> 01:18:58.100
<v Speaker 3>that praises other industries.</v>

1766
01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:02.700
<v Speaker 3>One of the mysteries is what's up with the snake and why did you go on with that</v>

1767
01:19:02.710 --> 01:19:03.650
<v Speaker 3>with the gardener?</v>

1768
01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:04.990
<v Speaker 3>But here's the answer for them.</v>

1769
01:19:04.991 --> 01:19:05.840
<v Speaker 3>As far as I can tell,</v>

1770
01:19:05.841 --> 01:19:07.160
<v Speaker 3>it's a very complicated answer,</v>

1771
01:19:07.161 --> 01:19:09.860
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately is a very complicated topic.</v>

1772
01:19:10.970 --> 01:19:13.910
<v Speaker 3>There's no way of walling know everything ever.</v>

1773
01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:15.291
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1774
01:19:15.291 --> 01:19:18.820
<v Speaker 3>So let's say do everything you possibly can to make out a safe and secure</v>

1775
01:19:18.821 --> 01:19:20.000
<v Speaker 3>environment for your children.</v>

1776
01:19:20.810 --> 01:19:23.800
<v Speaker 3>But what are you going to do about Internet pornography,</v>

1777
01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:24.793
<v Speaker 3>south side?</v>

1778
01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:27.800
<v Speaker 3>Are you going to forbid them to use the internet?</v>

1779
01:19:28.670 --> 01:19:28.821
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1780
01:19:28.821 --> 01:19:31.010
<v Speaker 3>that's the only way of getting rid of a whole set of snakes.</v>

1781
01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:35.030
<v Speaker 3>But you know what kind of timeline you're going to have to be in order to manage</v>

1782
01:19:35.031 --> 01:19:35.330
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1783
01:19:35.330 --> 01:19:37.580
<v Speaker 3>What need to do to change it in the basement?</v>

1784
01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:41.660
<v Speaker 3>Well then you've just replaced the Internet snake with the Tyrese snake.</v>

1785
01:19:41.690 --> 01:19:41.891
<v Speaker 3>You have,</v>

1786
01:19:41.891 --> 01:19:43.070
<v Speaker 3>you gotten rid of the snake,</v>

1787
01:19:43.071 --> 01:19:43.670
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1788
01:19:43.670 --> 01:19:45.080
<v Speaker 3>there's no getting rid of the snake.</v>

1789
01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:48.710
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing about the biblical story was that if you're going to make a</v>

1790
01:19:48.711 --> 01:19:49.401
<v Speaker 3>walled garden,</v>

1791
01:19:49.401 --> 01:19:52.250
<v Speaker 3>you're going to put a snake in it and there's no way around that.</v>

1792
01:19:52.730 --> 01:19:53.480
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1793
01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:56.630
<v Speaker 3>and that's merely to say that something unexpected always exist.</v>

1794
01:19:56.631 --> 01:19:58.480
<v Speaker 3>So no matter how well protected the surroundings.</v>

1795
01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:00.680
<v Speaker 3>So then the question is,</v>

1796
01:20:00.681 --> 01:20:02.990
<v Speaker 3>well what happens when you interacted with the snake?</v>

1797
01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:09.833
<v Speaker 2>What happened</v>

1798
01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:15.280
<v Speaker 2>in the story of Adam and eve when they were first created?</v>

1799
01:20:15.290 --> 01:20:16.980
<v Speaker 2>They kind of seem unconscious seven,</v>

1800
01:20:17.370 --> 01:20:21.650
<v Speaker 2>you're not really awake and they interact with the snake,</v>

1801
01:20:21.651 --> 01:20:26.060
<v Speaker 2>which is just unexpected thing is some expected thing that has a touch of</v>

1802
01:20:26.061 --> 01:20:29.180
<v Speaker 2>malevolence it and they wake up,</v>

1803
01:20:29.300 --> 01:20:30.110
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1804
01:20:30.110 --> 01:20:30.501
<v Speaker 2>Cause this,</v>

1805
01:20:30.501 --> 01:20:35.501
<v Speaker 2>the story says that after the serpent tells each this particular fruit that</v>

1806
01:20:37.610 --> 01:20:38.450
<v Speaker 2>she'll be wise,</v>

1807
01:20:38.460 --> 01:20:43.460
<v Speaker 2>like caught and so she eats her eyes open up the scales,</v>

1808
01:20:43.461 --> 01:20:44.360
<v Speaker 2>fall for bribes.</v>

1809
01:20:44.810 --> 01:20:48.140
<v Speaker 2>That's a mythological idea that's associated with the London lightning or</v>

1810
01:20:48.141 --> 01:20:52.580
<v Speaker 2>illumination or vision like because to have the scales fall from your eyes has</v>

1811
01:20:52.581 --> 01:20:54.650
<v Speaker 2>to see something that you haven't seen before.</v>

1812
01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:56.540
<v Speaker 2>What do you see?</v>

1813
01:20:56.720 --> 01:20:57.370
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1814
01:20:57.370 --> 01:20:57.670
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1815
01:20:57.670 --> 01:20:59.360
<v Speaker 2>Immediately did cheese.</v>

1816
01:21:01.210 --> 01:21:02.320
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>

1817
01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:04.240
<v Speaker 2>Well first of all,</v>

1818
01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:08.770
<v Speaker 2>you might notice that you're all close human needs and be wearing clothes,</v>

1819
01:21:09.220 --> 01:21:10.960
<v Speaker 2>clothes for a very long period of time.</v>

1820
01:21:10.961 --> 01:21:15.961
<v Speaker 2>It's tens of thousands of years and actually track the evolution of lice and</v>

1821
01:21:16.241 --> 01:21:16.750
<v Speaker 2>clothing.</v>

1822
01:21:16.750 --> 01:21:20.470
<v Speaker 2>You can track the evolution of clothing by tracking the genetic structure of</v>

1823
01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:21.333
<v Speaker 2>human lights,</v>

1824
01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:25.900
<v Speaker 2>because license all claim to clothing and you can tell how far back do you hold</v>

1825
01:21:25.901 --> 01:21:30.130
<v Speaker 2>that ability until you can derive from that an indication of when people first</v>

1826
01:21:30.131 --> 01:21:31.090
<v Speaker 2>started to wear clothes.</v>

1827
01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:34.330
<v Speaker 2>So it's been long enough so that license invulnerable to,</v>

1828
01:21:34.510 --> 01:21:34.840
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1829
01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:35.820
<v Speaker 2>to the downtown.</v>

1830
01:21:35.830 --> 01:21:36.790
<v Speaker 2>So it's a long time.</v>

1831
01:21:37.210 --> 01:21:39.190
<v Speaker 2>And why are your clothes,</v>

1832
01:21:41.890 --> 01:21:43.720
<v Speaker 2>he wakes up,</v>

1833
01:21:44.380 --> 01:21:47.980
<v Speaker 2>then she waits out of the house and she notices that she's naked.</v>

1834
01:21:48.550 --> 01:21:48.761
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1835
01:21:48.761 --> 01:21:50.210
<v Speaker 2>Now think about human beings.</v>

1836
01:21:50.830 --> 01:21:51.820
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

1837
01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:53.270
<v Speaker 2>we're not down on all fours,</v>

1838
01:21:53.530 --> 01:21:53.910
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1839
01:21:53.910 --> 01:21:54.743
<v Speaker 2>We're</v>

1840
01:21:55.590 --> 01:21:56.330
<v Speaker 2>now an animal's,</v>

1841
01:21:56.330 --> 01:21:59.410
<v Speaker 2>you're done all for the most vulnerable parts of them are hidden.</v>

1842
01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:02.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of armor light structures of their bag.</v>

1843
01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:03.310
<v Speaker 2>It's not that easy to get at.</v>

1844
01:22:03.311 --> 01:22:06.900
<v Speaker 2>An animal is vulnerable parts and some amicable curl up,</v>

1845
01:22:07.110 --> 01:22:07.770
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1846
01:22:07.770 --> 01:22:10.720
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] makes it hard for them to be torn apart.</v>

1847
01:22:11.030 --> 01:22:11.863
<v Speaker 2>Not Us.</v>

1848
01:22:12.310 --> 01:22:13.001
<v Speaker 2>We're right up,</v>

1849
01:22:13.001 --> 01:22:13.610
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1850
01:22:13.610 --> 01:22:16.750
<v Speaker 2>And the most vulnerable parts of us are exposed to the world,</v>

1851
01:22:16.751 --> 01:22:17.320
<v Speaker 2>to the,</v>

1852
01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:18.610
<v Speaker 2>not only to the elements,</v>

1853
01:22:18.790 --> 01:22:21.400
<v Speaker 2>to the analysis of everyone else.</v>

1854
01:22:21.700 --> 01:22:25.120
<v Speaker 2>So it's not only are our knowledge of our nakedness,</v>

1855
01:22:25.121 --> 01:22:28.470
<v Speaker 2>let's say against the terrible different nations of nature because we're rather</v>

1856
01:22:28.540 --> 01:22:33.370
<v Speaker 2>soft and tender and delicious bio with hours and but also because we're exposed</v>

1857
01:22:33.371 --> 01:22:38.170
<v Speaker 2>to the evaluation of other people and to wake up and realize that that's a very</v>

1858
01:22:38.171 --> 01:22:42.190
<v Speaker 2>interesting thing because it means that what happened to eat when she was</v>

1859
01:22:42.191 --> 01:22:45.040
<v Speaker 2>enlightened in the garden was that she woke up and realized that she was</v>

1860
01:22:45.041 --> 01:22:45.874
<v Speaker 2>vulnerable,</v>

1861
01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:46.421
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1862
01:22:46.421 --> 01:22:47.560
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentally vulnerable.</v>

1863
01:22:47.590 --> 01:22:49.120
<v Speaker 2>And then two things happen.</v>

1864
01:22:50.470 --> 01:22:54.610
<v Speaker 2>This realization that the dam and there's a realization of good and evil.</v>

1865
01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:56.630
<v Speaker 2>Now the realization of death,</v>

1866
01:22:56.650 --> 01:23:00.430
<v Speaker 2>that's relatively easy to understand because if you wake up and you realize that</v>

1867
01:23:00.431 --> 01:23:01.061
<v Speaker 2>you are vulnerable,</v>

1868
01:23:01.061 --> 01:23:02.420
<v Speaker 2>the logical extension of that,</v>

1869
01:23:02.421 --> 01:23:03.610
<v Speaker 2>it's to know that you could die,</v>

1870
01:23:03.670 --> 01:23:04.250
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1871
01:23:04.250 --> 01:23:06.010
<v Speaker 2>The logical stands for acknowledge</v>

1872
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:10.810
<v Speaker 3>of vulnerability is to view the future as a finite place to view yourself as</v>

1873
01:23:10.811 --> 01:23:13.930
<v Speaker 3>something that's started a terminal and and as far as we know will lead.</v>

1874
01:23:13.940 --> 01:23:15.270
<v Speaker 3>Human beings have that million.</v>

1875
01:23:15.610 --> 01:23:19.840
<v Speaker 3>And so that's something completely different than other teachers because we're</v>

1876
01:23:19.841 --> 01:23:23.680
<v Speaker 3>aware of our own vulnerability and the level isn't the case any other creature.</v>

1877
01:23:23.950 --> 01:23:28.900
<v Speaker 3>And that biblical story relates that as a cataclysmic event in the structure of</v>

1878
01:23:28.901 --> 01:23:29.734
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>

1879
01:23:29.770 --> 01:23:33.220
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's a reasonable way of proceeding it because we are,</v>

1880
01:23:33.910 --> 01:23:37.090
<v Speaker 3>we aren't conscious creatures and we're the only creatures that are true self</v>

1881
01:23:37.091 --> 01:23:42.091
<v Speaker 3>conscious and we don't know what the essential significance of that is except</v>

1882
01:23:42.431 --> 01:23:46.090
<v Speaker 3>that for us certainly propelled us into our historical developments.</v>

1883
01:23:46.690 --> 01:23:48.460
<v Speaker 3>So at least at the human level,</v>

1884
01:23:48.461 --> 01:23:50.040
<v Speaker 3>it's a cataclysmic discovery.</v>

1885
01:23:50.410 --> 01:23:51.670
<v Speaker 3>And then the next question is,</v>

1886
01:23:51.671 --> 01:23:52.120
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1887
01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:52.841
<v Speaker 3>okay fine.</v>

1888
01:23:52.841 --> 01:23:55.770
<v Speaker 3>So that's why you wake up when you discovered her naked and that kind of seek</v>

1889
01:23:55.780 --> 01:23:58.330
<v Speaker 3>the knowledge and the world.</v>

1890
01:23:58.390 --> 01:23:59.740
<v Speaker 3>What about needle?</v>

1891
01:24:01.150 --> 01:24:01.301
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1892
01:24:01.301 --> 01:24:03.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm puzzled on that for like 15 years.</v>

1893
01:24:03.401 --> 01:24:05.310
<v Speaker 3>Starts to take off once the health of the launch.</v>

1894
01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:06.700
<v Speaker 3>Then why does that,</v>

1895
01:24:06.910 --> 01:24:08.740
<v Speaker 3>why does the story relate to that way?</v>

1896
01:24:09.070 --> 01:24:09.940
<v Speaker 3>And more importantly,</v>

1897
01:24:09.970 --> 01:24:11.470
<v Speaker 3>why do we remember that story,</v>

1898
01:24:11.471 --> 01:24:11.711
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1899
01:24:11.711 --> 01:24:13.540
<v Speaker 3>That's an old stories.</v>

1900
01:24:13.870 --> 01:24:15.190
<v Speaker 3>Dozens of years old.</v>

1901
01:24:15.270 --> 01:24:17.990
<v Speaker 3>It's written for him and God only knows how old in its world.</v>

1902
01:24:18.430 --> 01:24:20.200
<v Speaker 3>We don't forget this story.</v>

1903
01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:21.670
<v Speaker 3>Well why not?</v>

1904
01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:21.911
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1905
01:24:21.911 --> 01:24:24.760
<v Speaker 3>who knows it into our memories come out.</v>

1906
01:24:24.790 --> 01:24:26.700
<v Speaker 3>That's why we didn't forget they talk this week.</v>

1907
01:24:26.980 --> 01:24:29.590
<v Speaker 3>So reason for that possibly.</v>

1908
01:24:29.980 --> 01:24:31.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm assuming that there's a reason for it.</v>

1909
01:24:32.020 --> 01:24:32.291
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1910
01:24:32.291 --> 01:24:35.440
<v Speaker 3>I didn't figure it out a little bit about it and 12 of us for life,</v>

1911
01:24:37.300 --> 01:24:38.740
<v Speaker 3>when you know you're vulnerable,</v>

1912
01:24:39.580 --> 01:24:40.580
<v Speaker 3>you know a hundred people there</v>

1913
01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:45.570
<v Speaker 3>and as soon as you know that your phone to hold another people are vulnerable,</v>

1914
01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:47.680
<v Speaker 3>you understand how you can be hurt,</v>

1915
01:24:48.190 --> 01:24:48.370
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1916
01:24:48.370 --> 01:24:49.750
<v Speaker 3>You don't just hit hurt.</v>

1917
01:24:50.590 --> 01:24:53.110
<v Speaker 3>You understand how you could be heard.</v>

1918
01:24:53.710 --> 01:24:56.140
<v Speaker 3>And as soon as you understand how you can be heard,</v>

1919
01:24:56.860 --> 01:24:58.710
<v Speaker 3>then you know how long people can be heard.</v>

1920
01:24:59.650 --> 01:25:01.320
<v Speaker 3>And as soon as you know how I met,</v>

1921
01:25:01.330 --> 01:25:02.620
<v Speaker 3>people can be heard.</v>

1922
01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:06.400
<v Speaker 3>Then what you have is the knowledge of good and evil because then you can decide</v>

1923
01:25:06.401 --> 01:25:09.880
<v Speaker 3>whether you're going to use your knowledge of what hurts you to hurt other</v>

1924
01:25:09.881 --> 01:25:13.180
<v Speaker 3>people and you're going to get the client to do that.</v>

1925
01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:15.460
<v Speaker 3>And so part of what that means is that the,</v>

1926
01:25:15.790 --> 01:25:20.050
<v Speaker 3>the whole issue of moral choice all of a sudden enters the world.</v>

1927
01:25:20.260 --> 01:25:21.660
<v Speaker 3>And that's the landscape</v>

1928
01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:22.953
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

1929
01:25:24.900 --> 01:25:25.733
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>

1930
01:25:25.870 --> 01:25:27.080
<v Speaker 3>so then what happens</v>

1931
01:25:29.980 --> 01:25:31.550
<v Speaker 3>if you could wake up,</v>

1932
01:25:32.030 --> 01:25:36.650
<v Speaker 3>which I think is right because I think that women probably Walkman and then we'd</v>

1933
01:25:36.651 --> 01:25:37.660
<v Speaker 3>never forgiven you for,</v>

1934
01:25:38.170 --> 01:25:40.730
<v Speaker 3>I think that that happens actually all the time,</v>

1935
01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:46.120
<v Speaker 3>which is part of the reason why the man in my Toronto drove up on the side door,</v>

1936
01:25:47.650 --> 01:25:52.650
<v Speaker 3>killed all those people is because women were making himself and he didn't like</v>

1937
01:25:53.661 --> 01:25:54.200
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1938
01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:54.471
<v Speaker 3>No one,</v>

1939
01:25:54.471 --> 01:25:59.471
<v Speaker 3>even him and his self conscience or something like I'm constitute in such a way</v>

1940
01:26:00.051 --> 01:26:04.250
<v Speaker 3>that what I desire is rejection and then maybe</v>

1941
01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:07.270
<v Speaker 2>bigger low on comprehension and murders.</v>

1942
01:26:10.020 --> 01:26:12.760
<v Speaker 2>Now women are prone to reject man.</v>

1943
01:26:13.670 --> 01:26:16.940
<v Speaker 2>You have twice as many female ancestors as male ancestors.</v>

1944
01:26:17.330 --> 01:26:20.030
<v Speaker 2>And the evolutionary biology seems quite clear.</v>

1945
01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:24.950
<v Speaker 2>The reason that we've diverged from a common ancestor of chimpanzees like human</v>

1946
01:26:24.951 --> 01:26:29.951
<v Speaker 2>beings is because chimpanzee females are not sexually selective and human</v>

1947
01:26:30.321 --> 01:26:31.940
<v Speaker 2>females are.</v>

1948
01:26:32.150 --> 01:26:32.983
<v Speaker 2>And that needs that.</v>

1949
01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:36.020
<v Speaker 2>Whatever progress we've made as a species,</v>

1950
01:26:36.021 --> 01:26:41.021
<v Speaker 2>assuming what we made constitutes progress as been as a consequence of women to</v>

1951
01:26:41.061 --> 01:26:43.410
<v Speaker 2>proclivity to reject man.</v>

1952
01:26:44.300 --> 01:26:45.051
<v Speaker 2>And you might think,</v>

1953
01:26:45.051 --> 01:26:45.860
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1954
01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:47.780
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's a price worth paying,</v>

1955
01:26:47.810 --> 01:26:50.120
<v Speaker 2>but it's not necessarily a price that you want to pay.</v>

1956
01:26:50.121 --> 01:26:51.760
<v Speaker 2>If you happen to be one of those band,</v>

1957
01:26:51.761 --> 01:26:53.780
<v Speaker 2>you were constantly being rejected.</v>

1958
01:26:54.110 --> 01:26:56.540
<v Speaker 2>Now perhaps you the right attitude to that is,</v>

1959
01:26:56.780 --> 01:27:00.620
<v Speaker 2>well you should figure out how to retool yourself so that you're not being</v>

1960
01:27:00.621 --> 01:27:03.530
<v Speaker 2>rejected by 50% of the population,</v>

1961
01:27:03.531 --> 01:27:07.250
<v Speaker 2>which is fairly solid evidence that there might be something about you that's</v>

1962
01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:11.180
<v Speaker 2>not exactly like straight and appropriate let's say.</v>

1963
01:27:11.510 --> 01:27:12.840
<v Speaker 2>But you know that's a harsh,</v>

1964
01:27:12.850 --> 01:27:16.970
<v Speaker 2>that's the harshest of all possible judgements and it's very difficult thing for</v>

1965
01:27:16.971 --> 01:27:18.970
<v Speaker 2>people to accept and no one did.</v>

1966
01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:19.970
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1967
01:27:19.970 --> 01:27:20.301
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1968
01:27:20.301 --> 01:27:21.134
<v Speaker 2>so anyways,</v>

1969
01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:23.740
<v Speaker 2>evenings having self conscious and then,</v>

1970
01:27:23.820 --> 01:27:24.531
<v Speaker 2>then what happens?</v>

1971
01:27:24.531 --> 01:27:29.360
<v Speaker 2>Well the next part of this story is a black comedy and so God goes for a walk to</v>

1972
01:27:29.370 --> 01:27:32.340
<v Speaker 2>the garden and he's accustomed to walking without him.</v>

1973
01:27:32.470 --> 01:27:33.560
<v Speaker 2>What that means to me,</v>

1974
01:27:33.561 --> 01:27:37.190
<v Speaker 2>I think it's something like we've already conceptualized in this talk to some</v>

1975
01:27:37.191 --> 01:27:40.780
<v Speaker 2>degree with Gog represents at least in this part of the narrative cycling or it</v>

1976
01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:43.640
<v Speaker 2>represents that divine consciousness.</v>

1977
01:27:43.641 --> 01:27:48.641
<v Speaker 2>Let's say that you partake in that confronts the potential of chaos,</v>

1978
01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:50.113
<v Speaker 2>transplants,</v>

1979
01:27:50.130 --> 01:27:55.130
<v Speaker 2>actuality to walk with that is to be guided by that principle.</v>

1980
01:27:55.190 --> 01:27:55.461
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1981
01:27:55.461 --> 01:27:56.360
<v Speaker 2>if you're on the street,</v>

1982
01:27:56.361 --> 01:27:57.190
<v Speaker 2>you know path,</v>

1983
01:27:57.190 --> 01:27:59.960
<v Speaker 2>you're where you should be at your life and not sure what you're doing.</v>

1984
01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:01.580
<v Speaker 2>And maybe that requires courage.</v>

1985
01:28:01.581 --> 01:28:05.600
<v Speaker 2>It requires you to be forthright and it requires you to look up into,</v>

1986
01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:09.350
<v Speaker 2>to try to make the world a better place rather than a terrible place.</v>

1987
01:28:09.620 --> 01:28:11.070
<v Speaker 2>And so Adam's just the customers,</v>

1988
01:28:11.071 --> 01:28:14.720
<v Speaker 2>do we have it today after he's woken up and become self conscious,</v>

1989
01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:17.530
<v Speaker 2>he hides like the hook.</v>

1990
01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:22.310
<v Speaker 2>And that's partly why it's comical because you can't hide behind.</v>

1991
01:28:22.730 --> 01:28:26.300
<v Speaker 2>You can't hide from God behind that Bush in a look.</v>

1992
01:28:26.310 --> 01:28:29.420
<v Speaker 2>Once somebody's gone is that I can even see through a bush,</v>

1993
01:28:29.700 --> 01:28:30.021
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1994
01:28:30.021 --> 01:28:34.590
<v Speaker 2>and it doesn't reflect for evolve out to intelligence God.</v>

1995
01:28:34.780 --> 01:28:36.440
<v Speaker 2>And he's hiding behind a bush.</v>

1996
01:28:36.770 --> 01:28:40.250
<v Speaker 2>And then he comes up with three ladies skews to so go out calls,</v>

1997
01:28:40.251 --> 01:28:41.050
<v Speaker 2>offices,</v>

1998
01:28:41.050 --> 01:28:41.340
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>

1999
01:28:41.340 --> 01:28:42.173
<v Speaker 2>what's up,</v>

2000
01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:44.210
<v Speaker 2>we're supposed to go for a walk it out.</v>

2001
01:28:44.211 --> 01:28:45.044
<v Speaker 2>And he says,</v>

2002
01:28:45.170 --> 01:28:46.003
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2003
01:28:46.430 --> 01:28:47.850
<v Speaker 2>I make an end to shame.</v>

2004
01:28:48.820 --> 01:28:50.030
<v Speaker 2>And God says,</v>

2005
01:28:50.031 --> 01:28:55.031
<v Speaker 2>who told you that you were naked and this is the terrible part of the story.</v>

2006
01:28:55.530 --> 01:28:56.210
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2007
01:28:56.210 --> 01:28:56.391
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2008
01:28:56.391 --> 01:28:58.850
<v Speaker 2>because eve is often portrayed as the villain.</v>

2009
01:28:58.910 --> 01:29:00.170
<v Speaker 2>At least that's the theory,</v>

2010
01:29:00.171 --> 01:29:00.960
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2011
01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:01.710
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>

2012
01:29:01.710 --> 01:29:02.430
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

2013
01:29:02.430 --> 01:29:05.790
<v Speaker 2>if you regard the mythical stories as part of the patriarchal oppression,</v>

2014
01:29:06.540 --> 01:29:11.180
<v Speaker 2>centuries long patriarchal oppression and eve is the bag first of whose rocket</v>

2015
01:29:11.181 --> 01:29:14.990
<v Speaker 2>man time madam is needs some think that it's complete rubbish because how did he</v>

2016
01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.670
<v Speaker 2>shows his true colors in the second part of the story?</v>

2017
01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:22.680
<v Speaker 2>Because as soon as God calls him who said that you were naked,</v>

2018
01:29:22.740 --> 01:29:23.850
<v Speaker 2>what does he do?</v>

2019
01:29:24.390 --> 01:29:26.250
<v Speaker 2>He says he does two things.</v>

2020
01:29:26.251 --> 01:29:27.084
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

2021
01:29:27.300 --> 01:29:29.490
<v Speaker 2>remember that the woman who made for me,</v>

2022
01:29:29.940 --> 01:29:31.110
<v Speaker 2>it's her fault.</v>

2023
01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:34.770
<v Speaker 2>And so that's a perfect day because it doesn't take responsibility for his own</v>

2024
01:29:34.771 --> 01:29:35.604
<v Speaker 2>action.</v>

2025
01:29:36.090 --> 01:29:40.530
<v Speaker 2>And first he blames the woman and then you'd late God.</v>

2026
01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:41.151
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2027
01:29:41.151 --> 01:29:45.620
<v Speaker 2>And you might think that takes a fair bit of goal and that's exactly right.</v>

2028
01:29:45.620 --> 01:29:47.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is relevant.</v>

2029
01:29:47.910 --> 01:29:52.910
<v Speaker 2>It's relevant because that's exactly what happened to this man in Toronto who</v>

2030
01:29:53.011 --> 01:29:53.970
<v Speaker 2>killed all those people.</v>

2031
01:29:54.270 --> 01:29:58.360
<v Speaker 2>First thing you did because of his painful self consciousness as plain white</v>

2032
01:29:58.361 --> 01:29:59.100
<v Speaker 2>men.</v>

2033
01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:01.060
<v Speaker 2>And the second thing you did was blaming God.</v>

2034
01:30:01.140 --> 01:30:04.290
<v Speaker 2>And the third one he did was take his revenge.</v>

2035
01:30:04.950 --> 01:30:05.161
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2036
01:30:05.161 --> 01:30:06.720
<v Speaker 2>so that's the next story.</v>

2037
01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:12.200
<v Speaker 2>So God isn't very happy with this because now the structure of Ba is permanently</v>

2038
01:30:14.311 --> 01:30:18.300
<v Speaker 2>disrupted by the emergence of self consciousness and the knowledge of death and</v>

2039
01:30:18.510 --> 01:30:20.370
<v Speaker 2>the emergence of the knowledge of good and evil.</v>

2040
01:30:20.371 --> 01:30:22.350
<v Speaker 2>It's like so much for that paradise,</v>

2041
01:30:22.351 --> 01:30:22.890
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2042
01:30:22.890 --> 01:30:27.360
<v Speaker 2>It's people have evolved beyond their childhood.</v>

2043
01:30:27.630 --> 01:30:30.450
<v Speaker 2>Harriet's same thing happens to the Buddha when he matures,</v>

2044
01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:30.701
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2045
01:30:30.701 --> 01:30:33.690
<v Speaker 2>Because as father and links in a walled city,</v>

2046
01:30:33.750 --> 01:30:36.150
<v Speaker 2>it's all where there's no age and there's no death,</v>

2047
01:30:36.270 --> 01:30:37.440
<v Speaker 2>there's no sickness.</v>

2048
01:30:37.590 --> 01:30:39.540
<v Speaker 2>And he grows up in there and everything's perfect,</v>

2049
01:30:39.541 --> 01:30:40.410
<v Speaker 2>but it gets curious.</v>

2050
01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:44.490
<v Speaker 2>He goes outside the walls of the city and the first thing he encounters is</v>

2051
01:30:44.820 --> 01:30:45.451
<v Speaker 2>sickness.</v>

2052
01:30:45.451 --> 01:30:49.230
<v Speaker 2>And then he encounters old age at different voyage and any encounters,</v>

2053
01:30:49.290 --> 01:30:54.020
<v Speaker 2>death and he encounters get never goes back inside the waltz,</v>

2054
01:30:54.030 --> 01:30:55.570
<v Speaker 2>in his father's name for it.</v>

2055
01:30:55.710 --> 01:30:56.880
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly the same.</v>

2056
01:30:56.881 --> 01:30:57.714
<v Speaker 2>Might be.</v>

2057
01:30:58.290 --> 01:30:59.010
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

2058
01:30:59.010 --> 01:30:59.581
<v Speaker 2>God says,</v>

2059
01:30:59.581 --> 01:31:00.830
<v Speaker 2>well now to change up,</v>

2060
01:31:00.870 --> 01:31:01.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2061
01:31:01.290 --> 01:31:02.220
<v Speaker 2>you've really done it.</v>

2062
01:31:02.910 --> 01:31:03.960
<v Speaker 2>Here's what's going to happen.</v>

2063
01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:07.660
<v Speaker 2>You knew about the future and now you're going to have to work.</v>

2064
01:31:08.010 --> 01:31:10.800
<v Speaker 2>Because as soon as you know about the future,</v>

2065
01:31:11.190 --> 01:31:12.330
<v Speaker 2>then you have to work.</v>

2066
01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:15.450
<v Speaker 2>Because even if things are going well now that doesn't mean they're going to go</v>

2067
01:31:15.451 --> 01:31:18.600
<v Speaker 2>well in Amman and you better get ready for that.</v>

2068
01:31:18.630 --> 01:31:22.200
<v Speaker 2>You better get ready for the winter then get ready for your old age and they're</v>

2069
01:31:22.201 --> 01:31:25.620
<v Speaker 2>getting ready for the fact that you might get ill and so you're work.</v>

2070
01:31:26.250 --> 01:31:27.083
<v Speaker 2>That's that.</v>

2071
01:31:27.100 --> 01:31:28.620
<v Speaker 2>As human beings work,</v>

2072
01:31:28.710 --> 01:31:32.820
<v Speaker 2>we work because we're aware of the future and he tells eve while you're in</v>

2073
01:31:32.821 --> 01:31:33.630
<v Speaker 2>trouble too,</v>

2074
01:31:33.630 --> 01:31:35.520
<v Speaker 2>and I won't go into this in too much detail,</v>

2075
01:31:35.521 --> 01:31:40.521
<v Speaker 2>but part of each trouble is that she's going to give birth to intelligent,</v>

2076
01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:46.640
<v Speaker 2>large skull and highly dependent children and they're going to tear her apart</v>

2077
01:31:46.811 --> 01:31:49.740
<v Speaker 2>and shelter and she's going to have to be dependent on her husband.</v>

2078
01:31:50.310 --> 01:31:54.090
<v Speaker 2>And so those are the dual curses of whatever we get into wake up.</v>

2079
01:31:54.690 --> 01:31:58.170
<v Speaker 2>So when the world and what my history starts as far as the biblical stories are</v>

2080
01:31:58.171 --> 01:31:59.004
<v Speaker 2>concerned.</v>

2081
01:31:59.270 --> 01:32:00.550
<v Speaker 2>And then there's the second story</v>

2082
01:32:03.700 --> 01:32:08.600
<v Speaker 2>is the story of painting and very short stories.</v>

2083
01:32:08.601 --> 01:32:09.790
<v Speaker 2>Something about a paragraph long,</v>

2084
01:32:09.791 --> 01:32:10.650
<v Speaker 2>it's like 10 seconds.</v>

2085
01:32:11.030 --> 01:32:13.420
<v Speaker 2>It's got to meet that richest 10 sentence has ever written.</v>

2086
01:32:13.421 --> 01:32:17.800
<v Speaker 2>And I think so he had looked at first two real big,</v>

2087
01:32:18.790 --> 01:32:22.360
<v Speaker 2>I need not because either leave by out so he can hardly count them.</v>

2088
01:32:22.370 --> 01:32:27.370
<v Speaker 2>Now Cain and Abel were actually born in history to a mother and a father.</v>

2089
01:32:28.271 --> 01:32:30.820
<v Speaker 2>So then there was the real no real human beings,</v>

2090
01:32:30.830 --> 01:32:31.070
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2091
01:32:31.070 --> 01:32:32.590
<v Speaker 2>In the real world.</v>

2092
01:32:32.860 --> 01:32:33.693
<v Speaker 2>And there are a pattern.</v>

2093
01:32:33.930 --> 01:32:38.590
<v Speaker 2>There's a pattern of a hostile progress like foreign local evangelicals,</v>

2094
01:32:38.610 --> 01:32:39.443
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2095
01:32:39.610 --> 01:32:41.350
<v Speaker 2>Or Harry Potter and Voldemort.</v>

2096
01:32:41.380 --> 01:32:42.870
<v Speaker 2>Same IPFS is,</v>

2097
01:32:42.940 --> 01:32:47.200
<v Speaker 2>or back after the Joburg or superman and Lex Luthor doesn't matter the good guy</v>

2098
01:32:47.201 --> 01:32:47.981
<v Speaker 2>and a bad guy,</v>

2099
01:32:47.981 --> 01:32:48.540
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2100
01:32:48.540 --> 01:32:49.870
<v Speaker 2>The or that,</v>

2101
01:32:49.930 --> 01:32:53.070
<v Speaker 2>the quasi messiah and the safety himself,</v>

2102
01:32:53.110 --> 01:32:53.560
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2103
01:32:53.560 --> 01:32:54.850
<v Speaker 2>It's the same pattern,</v>

2104
01:32:54.860 --> 01:32:58.780
<v Speaker 2>intention and tested instantly as soon as this landscape is laid out.</v>

2105
01:32:58.810 --> 01:33:00.610
<v Speaker 2>So what happens to Cain and Abel?</v>

2106
01:33:00.670 --> 01:33:01.503
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2107
01:33:01.750 --> 01:33:05.470
<v Speaker 2>they made sacrifices and that's the first part of the story that hard to</v>

2108
01:33:05.471 --> 01:33:06.060
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>

2109
01:33:06.060 --> 01:33:11.060
<v Speaker 2>His April offers the best pumps of neat that he has is the choices everyone's</v>

2110
01:33:13.860 --> 01:33:17.410
<v Speaker 2>from Splore burdensome offers the smoke you got,</v>

2111
01:33:17.590 --> 01:33:19.240
<v Speaker 2>it's a little lonely aren't caring side.</v>

2112
01:33:19.630 --> 01:33:20.200
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2113
01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:21.520
<v Speaker 2>So what's the idea?</v>

2114
01:33:21.550 --> 01:33:23.500
<v Speaker 2>Well God is in the heavens.</v>

2115
01:33:23.860 --> 01:33:25.540
<v Speaker 2>What you think that I'll get,</v>

2116
01:33:25.541 --> 01:33:27.160
<v Speaker 2>cause when you look up at the night sky,</v>

2117
01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:28.750
<v Speaker 2>it fills you with awe.</v>

2118
01:33:28.780 --> 01:33:30.460
<v Speaker 2>You can seize this infinite expanse.</v>

2119
01:33:30.461 --> 01:33:31.420
<v Speaker 2>You have to say the spirits.</v>

2120
01:33:31.421 --> 01:33:32.650
<v Speaker 2>When you look at the sun and the moon,</v>

2121
01:33:32.651 --> 01:33:34.420
<v Speaker 2>it's that which is beyond you.</v>

2122
01:33:34.510 --> 01:33:37.330
<v Speaker 2>The human imagination populates that domain,</v>

2123
01:33:37.331 --> 01:33:38.350
<v Speaker 2>which divinity?</v>

2124
01:33:38.830 --> 01:33:40.960
<v Speaker 2>The ultimate well and where is that?</v>

2125
01:33:40.961 --> 01:33:41.440
<v Speaker 2>It's out.</v>

2126
01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:42.810
<v Speaker 2>Well how do you communicate with what's,</v>

2127
01:33:43.390 --> 01:33:48.390
<v Speaker 2>oh smoke rises and so you offer something to the absolute and it can get a sense</v>

2128
01:33:49.901 --> 01:33:54.790
<v Speaker 2>of the quality of your offering as a consequence of the rising of the smoke.</v>

2129
01:33:55.420 --> 01:33:55.901
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

2130
01:33:55.901 --> 01:33:59.440
<v Speaker 2>it's an archaic idea that you can grow it as this childlike idea of not child</v>

2131
01:33:59.490 --> 01:34:00.670
<v Speaker 2>Yasha a child life.</v>

2132
01:34:02.190 --> 01:34:04.480
<v Speaker 2>So you communicate with dogs from sacrifice.</v>

2133
01:34:05.830 --> 01:34:10.630
<v Speaker 2>Cain sacrifices his offerings and able sacrifices his,</v>

2134
01:34:11.970 --> 01:34:14.560
<v Speaker 2>but then because we're taking these stories seriously,</v>

2135
01:34:14.710 --> 01:34:14.951
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2136
01:34:14.951 --> 01:34:15.700
<v Speaker 2>well what's going on?</v>

2137
01:34:15.700 --> 01:34:16.533
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

2138
01:34:17.050 --> 01:34:20.020
<v Speaker 2>well here's what's going on and this is how finding the 12 rules for life as</v>

2139
01:34:20.021 --> 01:34:20.201
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

2140
01:34:20.201 --> 01:34:24.440
<v Speaker 2>This is also about 20 years to figure out what about this idea of separate twice</v>

2141
01:34:24.441 --> 01:34:25.750
<v Speaker 2>what the health behind that,</v>

2142
01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:26.920
<v Speaker 2>because it's a human universal,</v>

2143
01:34:26.921 --> 01:34:27.131
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2144
01:34:27.131 --> 01:34:28.420
<v Speaker 2>You find sacrificial,</v>

2145
01:34:28.430 --> 01:34:29.310
<v Speaker 2>OTC efferent.</v>

2146
01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:32.110
<v Speaker 2>We remember while you can think,</v>

2147
01:34:32.111 --> 01:34:32.861
<v Speaker 2>you can think it through,</v>

2148
01:34:32.861 --> 01:34:36.680
<v Speaker 2>if you think about how people use the word sacrifice in,</v>

2149
01:34:36.690 --> 01:34:36.811
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

2150
01:34:36.811 --> 01:34:37.870
<v Speaker 2>in really modern times.</v>

2151
01:34:38.210 --> 01:34:40.740
<v Speaker 2>Or I teach my students at the University of trial,</v>

2152
01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:43.270
<v Speaker 2>but other than when children are first generation immigrants,</v>

2153
01:34:43.660 --> 01:34:44.350
<v Speaker 2>so they're,</v>

2154
01:34:44.350 --> 01:34:44.531
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2155
01:34:44.531 --> 01:34:49.531
<v Speaker 2>their parents sacrificed a lot in order to give them an opportunity.</v>

2156
01:34:49.780 --> 01:34:50.860
<v Speaker 2>So what they sacrifice,</v>

2157
01:34:50.861 --> 01:34:52.870
<v Speaker 2>but they offer the sacrifice of their home country.</v>

2158
01:34:53.170 --> 01:34:56.770
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they sacrifice a profession because maybe they were doctors where they</v>

2159
01:34:56.771 --> 01:34:57.170
<v Speaker 2>came,</v>

2160
01:34:57.170 --> 01:34:58.610
<v Speaker 2>the couldn't get licensed in Canada,</v>

2161
01:34:58.611 --> 01:35:02.210
<v Speaker 2>so they end up running up convenience store or laundry or something like that.</v>

2162
01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:03.020
<v Speaker 2>Working,</v>

2163
01:35:03.020 --> 01:35:03.853
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2164
01:35:04.010 --> 01:35:06.680
<v Speaker 2>punishing their kids have an opportunity.</v>

2165
01:35:06.740 --> 01:35:08.300
<v Speaker 2>So if you ask the kids,</v>

2166
01:35:08.301 --> 01:35:10.940
<v Speaker 2>but what did your parents sacrificing that you could go to university?</v>

2167
01:35:10.941 --> 01:35:12.300
<v Speaker 2>It's like their hands are up right away.</v>

2168
01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:14.950
<v Speaker 2>They have the staff that language and then you can ask them to,</v>

2169
01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:15.041
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2170
01:35:15.041 --> 01:35:19.280
<v Speaker 2>what do you sacrifice for your grades all I don't party every night,</v>

2171
01:35:19.430 --> 01:35:19.641
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2172
01:35:19.641 --> 01:35:21.650
<v Speaker 2>I for go ratification.</v>

2173
01:35:22.430 --> 01:35:23.390
<v Speaker 2>So what does it mean?</v>

2174
01:35:23.450 --> 01:35:28.010
<v Speaker 2>I sacrifice something I valued APG make to make the future better.</v>

2175
01:35:28.100 --> 01:35:32.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm acting out the proposition that I can bargain with Phage by giving them</v>

2176
01:35:32.841 --> 01:35:33.231
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

2177
01:35:33.231 --> 01:35:35.510
<v Speaker 2>Now I can make something better in the future.</v>

2178
01:35:36.110 --> 01:35:39.440
<v Speaker 2>That is an absolutely overwhelming discovery.</v>

2179
01:35:39.950 --> 01:35:44.780
<v Speaker 2>That's what human beings discovered is that it's so strange because it works.</v>

2180
01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:49.610
<v Speaker 2>You can give up things that you value in the present and it does pay off in the</v>

2181
01:35:49.611 --> 01:35:50.444
<v Speaker 2>future.</v>

2182
01:35:50.660 --> 01:35:53.810
<v Speaker 2>Now that's partly because you're bargaining with future people,</v>

2183
01:35:53.870 --> 01:35:55.490
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not going to get into that.</v>

2184
01:35:55.610 --> 01:35:58.480
<v Speaker 2>You can read more about how the 12 rules for life if you warm.</v>

2185
01:35:59.090 --> 01:36:04.090
<v Speaker 2>The point is that it wasn't archaic as the ritual was Sikh people were acting up</v>

2186
01:36:05.610 --> 01:36:07.210
<v Speaker 2>something they didn't understand.</v>

2187
01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:11.510
<v Speaker 2>They've watched how people that were successful were successful and they watched</v>

2188
01:36:11.511 --> 01:36:16.120
<v Speaker 2>people how people who weren't successful weren't successful and they extracted</v>

2189
01:36:16.130 --> 01:36:19.580
<v Speaker 2>out this idea that the people who were successful were doing something that made</v>

2190
01:36:19.581 --> 01:36:22.610
<v Speaker 2>them successful and it was like sacrifice.</v>

2191
01:36:22.930 --> 01:36:27.200
<v Speaker 2>And so they ritualizing sacrifices have you understand what it was and</v>

2192
01:36:27.201 --> 01:36:29.390
<v Speaker 2>eventually that became a psychological concept,</v>

2193
01:36:29.391 --> 01:36:29.870
<v Speaker 2>which was,</v>

2194
01:36:29.870 --> 01:36:30.021
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2195
01:36:30.021 --> 01:36:30.830
<v Speaker 2>you can give,</v>

2196
01:36:30.830 --> 01:36:31.663
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2197
01:36:31.700 --> 01:36:34.370
<v Speaker 2>you do that when you to renew yourself and the new year's festival,</v>

2198
01:36:34.490 --> 01:36:34.911
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

2199
01:36:34.911 --> 01:36:37.220
<v Speaker 2>which is an unbelievably old idea.</v>

2200
01:36:37.221 --> 01:36:41.330
<v Speaker 2>You give up your pathological past self and you make some,</v>

2201
01:36:42.020 --> 01:36:42.510
<v Speaker 2>what do you call,</v>

2202
01:36:42.510 --> 01:36:43.320
<v Speaker 2>goals,</v>

2203
01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:44.030
<v Speaker 2>resolution.</v>

2204
01:36:44.030 --> 01:36:48.150
<v Speaker 2>There's some issues about how you can be a very new in the future and that's a</v>

2205
01:36:48.151 --> 01:36:53.151
<v Speaker 2>sacrificial app and it's based on a very old ritual that has roots,</v>

2206
01:36:54.291 --> 01:36:55.730
<v Speaker 2>at least in Mesopotamia,</v>

2207
01:36:55.820 --> 01:36:58.700
<v Speaker 2>at least 5,000 years ago where the king had to,</v>

2208
01:36:58.701 --> 01:37:03.050
<v Speaker 2>I'd do that every new year so that he could be a good king for the upcoming</v>

2209
01:37:03.050 --> 01:37:03.590
<v Speaker 2>year,</v>

2210
01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:05.090
<v Speaker 2>which you can also read about that.</v>

2211
01:37:05.090 --> 01:37:05.530
<v Speaker 2>It maps it.</v>

2212
01:37:05.530 --> 01:37:07.140
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you want to read about that.</v>

2213
01:37:07.300 --> 01:37:08.660
<v Speaker 2>The interesting anyways.</v>

2214
01:37:08.661 --> 01:37:10.620
<v Speaker 2>The whole idea is that this whole sacrifice,</v>

2215
01:37:10.740 --> 01:37:11.930
<v Speaker 2>this actually works,</v>

2216
01:37:12.170 --> 01:37:15.350
<v Speaker 2>and then that rig that brings up a whole realm of questions.</v>

2217
01:37:15.351 --> 01:37:15.890
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2218
01:37:15.890 --> 01:37:16.011
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2219
01:37:16.011 --> 01:37:17.510
<v Speaker 2>the sacrifice works.</v>

2220
01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:20.390
<v Speaker 2>What's the best possible sacrifice,</v>

2221
01:37:20.630 --> 01:37:20.901
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2222
01:37:20.901 --> 01:37:23.510
<v Speaker 2>Because that's obviously when you figured out that it works,</v>

2223
01:37:24.590 --> 01:37:27.860
<v Speaker 2>you want to figure out what we optimize it and part of that is you have to</v>

2224
01:37:27.861 --> 01:37:31.950
<v Speaker 2>sacrifice that which she loved and that's part of the active labor.</v>

2225
01:37:31.980 --> 01:37:34.250
<v Speaker 2>When Abraham is called on to sacrifice,</v>

2226
01:37:34.251 --> 01:37:34.561
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>

2227
01:37:34.561 --> 01:37:36.100
<v Speaker 2>I guess the emergence of that idea,</v>

2228
01:37:36.170 --> 01:37:39.260
<v Speaker 2>maybe what you love most is a personally love the most and you think,</v>

2229
01:37:39.261 --> 01:37:42.890
<v Speaker 2>well does that mean you said offer your son up to God?</v>

2230
01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:46.010
<v Speaker 2>Hence what you mean when you ask me the questions because the answer that</v>

2231
01:37:46.011 --> 01:37:47.750
<v Speaker 2>question is actually yes.</v>

2232
01:37:47.850 --> 01:37:48.321
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

2233
01:37:48.321 --> 01:37:52.580
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly what you do if you're an ideal parent because you want your son</v>

2234
01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:56.040
<v Speaker 2>and your daughter to be as good as</v>

2235
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:57.960
<v Speaker 3>they can possibly be,</v>

2236
01:37:58.020 --> 01:37:58.441
<v Speaker 3>let's say.</v>

2237
01:37:58.441 --> 01:38:01.200
<v Speaker 3>How can make any sacrifices that are necessary in order to carry,</v>

2238
01:38:01.201 --> 01:38:02.034
<v Speaker 3>there's your life.</v>

2239
01:38:02.190 --> 01:38:05.370
<v Speaker 3>So even though the idea again is barbaric and are archaic,</v>

2240
01:38:05.390 --> 01:38:07.080
<v Speaker 3>couldn't it's ritual form.</v>

2241
01:38:07.110 --> 01:38:10.170
<v Speaker 3>There's a siege in that are calculable.</v>

2242
01:38:10.171 --> 01:38:10.980
<v Speaker 3>Brilliant.</v>

2243
01:38:10.980 --> 01:38:11.850
<v Speaker 3>In any case,</v>

2244
01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:18.560
<v Speaker 3>God's happy with Abel sacrifices and he's not happy with Katie suffer pharmacies</v>

2245
01:38:19.020 --> 01:38:22.380
<v Speaker 3>and there's reality and is not exactly what the swine and the story,</v>

2246
01:38:22.740 --> 01:38:25.500
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of thing.</v>

2247
01:38:25.740 --> 01:38:26.640
<v Speaker 3>Not Exactly.</v>

2248
01:38:26.641 --> 01:38:27.101
<v Speaker 3>There's hymns,</v>

2249
01:38:27.101 --> 01:38:29.370
<v Speaker 3>but it's vague and that's good because you know,</v>

2250
01:38:29.550 --> 01:38:33.420
<v Speaker 3>you know what life is like if you're doing everything you can to sick yourself,</v>

2251
01:38:33.421 --> 01:38:33.701
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2252
01:38:33.701 --> 01:38:36.660
<v Speaker 3>And to put the world in order around and it isn't working,</v>

2253
01:38:37.740 --> 01:38:40.200
<v Speaker 3>your sacrifices are being rejected.</v>

2254
01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:40.521
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2255
01:38:40.521 --> 01:38:42.150
<v Speaker 3>what's the consequence of that?</v>

2256
01:38:42.540 --> 01:38:42.661
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2257
01:38:42.661 --> 01:38:43.740
<v Speaker 3>if you're not trying,</v>

2258
01:38:43.741 --> 01:38:44.790
<v Speaker 3>when you fail,</v>

2259
01:38:45.180 --> 01:38:50.180
<v Speaker 3>well that's sucks because it's not very exciting not to try and who the hell</v>

2260
01:38:50.821 --> 01:38:51.541
<v Speaker 3>wants to fail,</v>

2261
01:38:51.541 --> 01:38:55.860
<v Speaker 3>but at least you're not punished for your best efforts.</v>

2262
01:38:56.190 --> 01:38:59.190
<v Speaker 3>But if you make your sacrifices and they're rejected,</v>

2263
01:38:59.490 --> 01:39:03.050
<v Speaker 3>then what's the right attitude towards up?</v>

2264
01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:03.421
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2265
01:39:03.421 --> 01:39:04.071
<v Speaker 3>Keynes out.</v>

2266
01:39:04.071 --> 01:39:06.720
<v Speaker 3>The key is to get bigger.</v>

2267
01:39:07.410 --> 01:39:09.440
<v Speaker 3>He gets fitter because Abel is,</v>

2268
01:39:09.441 --> 01:39:12.040
<v Speaker 3>you're making these sacrifices and works like mad.</v>

2269
01:39:12.290 --> 01:39:13.950
<v Speaker 3>God's thrilled about Abel.</v>

2270
01:39:13.980 --> 01:39:17.100
<v Speaker 3>He's partner with a women blocks increase.</v>

2271
01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:18.450
<v Speaker 3>Everybody likes him worse.</v>

2272
01:39:18.610 --> 01:39:21.480
<v Speaker 3>He's the sort of guy who deserves it and that's super annoying,</v>

2273
01:39:21.481 --> 01:39:21.790
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2274
01:39:21.790 --> 01:39:25.560
<v Speaker 3>Because there's nothing more annoying than coming to meet someone hyper</v>

2275
01:39:25.561 --> 01:39:28.590
<v Speaker 3>successful and then also realizing that they deserve it.</v>

2276
01:39:28.650 --> 01:39:32.220
<v Speaker 3>You think that person would have the good graces to be contemptible so you</v>

2277
01:39:32.221 --> 01:39:35.310
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't have to be envious about the fact that everything is going well for</v>

2278
01:39:35.311 --> 01:39:35.820
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2279
01:39:35.820 --> 01:39:38.070
<v Speaker 3>But often that doesn't work out.</v>

2280
01:39:38.100 --> 01:39:41.670
<v Speaker 3>So Kane isn't he raised by Dick Spice,</v>

2281
01:39:41.730 --> 01:39:46.730
<v Speaker 3>continual failure and he's outraged at Abel because Abel successes casting this</v>

2282
01:39:48.001 --> 01:39:53.001
<v Speaker 3>failure and even a more dim light and he's brooding about the unjustice</v>

2283
01:39:53.110 --> 01:39:58.110
<v Speaker 3>injustice in the world and so he decides to call out God because Adam get it,</v>

2284
01:39:59.790 --> 01:40:00.990
<v Speaker 3>why not cane?</v>

2285
01:40:01.140 --> 01:40:05.220
<v Speaker 3>And so he has a little chat with God and says something along the lines.</v>

2286
01:40:05.230 --> 01:40:09.390
<v Speaker 3>I've heard a lot of different translations of this major change to get to what</v>

2287
01:40:09.391 --> 01:40:12.060
<v Speaker 3>was at the bottom of it is quite complicated.</v>

2288
01:40:12.630 --> 01:40:15.640
<v Speaker 3>But basically what happens is Katie calls out God,</v>

2289
01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:16.620
<v Speaker 3>creator of reality.</v>

2290
01:40:16.621 --> 01:40:17.970
<v Speaker 3>He says something like,</v>

2291
01:40:18.420 --> 01:40:19.950
<v Speaker 3>what the hell is up here?</v>

2292
01:40:21.220 --> 01:40:26.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm breaking myself in half trying to have a half decent life in.</v>

2293
01:40:27.340 --> 01:40:30.720
<v Speaker 3>Everything I do is turns to ash.</v>

2294
01:40:31.350 --> 01:40:36.350
<v Speaker 3>And then there's my brother whose doesn't seem to be making sacrifices or any</v>

2295
01:40:37.131 --> 01:40:39.100
<v Speaker 3>more heartfelt than me,</v>

2296
01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:40.890
<v Speaker 3>isn't spectacular success.</v>

2297
01:40:40.891 --> 01:40:41.460
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2298
01:40:41.460 --> 01:40:42.690
<v Speaker 3>what the Hell's going on?</v>

2299
01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:43.980
<v Speaker 3>Kinda crazy planet.</v>

2300
01:40:43.981 --> 01:40:47.990
<v Speaker 3>Is this anyway to that you've created where this sort of thing is so likely to</v>

2301
01:40:47.991 --> 01:40:48.640
<v Speaker 3>happen?</v>

2302
01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:51.730
<v Speaker 3>How do you know you might first of all go to that?</v>

2303
01:40:51.740 --> 01:40:56.140
<v Speaker 3>The probability that you thought that way of you license from time to time is</v>

2304
01:40:56.230 --> 01:40:58.480
<v Speaker 3>100% in fact,</v>

2305
01:40:58.810 --> 01:41:02.440
<v Speaker 3>I suspect that there's a substantial number of you in the room who think like</v>

2306
01:41:02.441 --> 01:41:04.000
<v Speaker 3>that almost all the time.</v>

2307
01:41:04.750 --> 01:41:07.980
<v Speaker 3>It's extraordinary attempting because when things fall apart for you,</v>

2308
01:41:08.020 --> 01:41:09.580
<v Speaker 3>which they do from time to time,</v>

2309
01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:10.150
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

2310
01:41:10.150 --> 01:41:10.391
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2311
01:41:10.391 --> 01:41:14.200
<v Speaker 3>who doesn't want to go outside and shake his fist at the sky and rail against</v>

2312
01:41:14.260 --> 01:41:15.780
<v Speaker 3>the horror of blind faith?</v>

2313
01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:16.541
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2314
01:41:16.541 --> 01:41:17.650
<v Speaker 3>The question arises,</v>

2315
01:41:17.810 --> 01:41:22.210
<v Speaker 3>how can the world be constituted in such an unjust manner and who's to blame?</v>

2316
01:41:22.300 --> 01:41:22.721
<v Speaker 3>You might say,</v>

2317
01:41:22.721 --> 01:41:22.871
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2318
01:41:22.871 --> 01:41:23.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe in God.</v>

2319
01:41:23.951 --> 01:41:24.790
<v Speaker 3>It's again,</v>

2320
01:41:24.791 --> 01:41:25.720
<v Speaker 3>it's irrelevant.</v>

2321
01:41:25.750 --> 01:41:30.010
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter from the psychological perspective it happens anyways.</v>

2322
01:41:30.190 --> 01:41:31.720
<v Speaker 3>You act it out anyways.</v>

2323
01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:32.740
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>

2324
01:41:32.740 --> 01:41:33.580
<v Speaker 3>God listens,</v>

2325
01:41:34.390 --> 01:41:35.170
<v Speaker 3>but he's not,</v>

2326
01:41:35.170 --> 01:41:35.591
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2327
01:41:35.591 --> 01:41:37.540
<v Speaker 3>taking responsibility because,</v>

2328
01:41:39.550 --> 01:41:41.130
<v Speaker 3>because he thinks it's king's fault.</v>

2329
01:41:42.050 --> 01:41:43.900
<v Speaker 3>And so this is what he tells kink essentially.</v>

2330
01:41:43.930 --> 01:41:46.780
<v Speaker 3>He says it's a very interesting use of language.</v>

2331
01:41:46.781 --> 01:41:47.614
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>

2332
01:41:48.010 --> 01:41:50.590
<v Speaker 3>Sin crouches sin by the way,</v>

2333
01:41:50.591 --> 01:41:54.730
<v Speaker 3>that we're needs to draw your Arrow back and to miss the target.</v>

2334
01:41:55.420 --> 01:41:57.400
<v Speaker 3>It's a very particular kind of work.</v>

2335
01:41:57.520 --> 01:42:00.880
<v Speaker 3>It needs to miss what you're in rehab or perhaps in a team at all.</v>

2336
01:42:01.250 --> 01:42:05.590
<v Speaker 3>So it implies that perhaps you're aiming wrong if you don't hit the target right</v>

2337
01:42:06.010 --> 01:42:07.410
<v Speaker 3>and you specify the target.</v>

2338
01:42:07.411 --> 01:42:12.411
<v Speaker 3>So that's an interesting part of that as well says to Cain,</v>

2339
01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:17.760
<v Speaker 3>Sin Crouches at your door like a predatory sexually aroused cap</v>

2340
01:42:19.510 --> 01:42:21.430
<v Speaker 3>you've invited into your life.</v>

2341
01:42:21.850 --> 01:42:26.850
<v Speaker 3>You've opened the door to it and you voluntarily had your way with it.</v>

2342
01:42:27.340 --> 01:42:28.880
<v Speaker 3>And it means that in a sexual manner,</v>

2343
01:42:28.980 --> 01:42:32.560
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of like the old idea that a vampire can't come into your house on us.</v>

2344
01:42:32.561 --> 01:42:33.460
<v Speaker 3>He would fight it.</v>

2345
01:42:33.910 --> 01:42:34.631
<v Speaker 3>So first of all,</v>

2346
01:42:34.631 --> 01:42:35.830
<v Speaker 3>he tells Kane,</v>

2347
01:42:36.820 --> 01:42:40.750
<v Speaker 3>don't be so sure that it's the structure of reality that's at fault here.</v>

2348
01:42:41.620 --> 01:42:44.260
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's something that you're either doing or not doing.</v>

2349
01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:45.630
<v Speaker 3>And he accuses him directly.</v>

2350
01:42:45.631 --> 01:42:45.911
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>

2351
01:42:45.911 --> 01:42:48.370
<v Speaker 3>not only are you not giving it,</v>

2352
01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:49.420
<v Speaker 3>you're also doing it.</v>

2353
01:42:49.630 --> 01:42:51.150
<v Speaker 3>There's something there that's lurking.</v>

2354
01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:52.120
<v Speaker 3>It's not good.</v>

2355
01:42:52.570 --> 01:42:53.980
<v Speaker 3>You've asked him to come in,</v>

2356
01:42:54.070 --> 01:42:55.720
<v Speaker 3>no way have you asked him to command.</v>

2357
01:42:55.770 --> 01:43:00.770
<v Speaker 3>You made it with it in a creative manner and you've given birth to something</v>

2358
01:43:01.420 --> 01:43:04.120
<v Speaker 3>horrible as a consequence and you know it.</v>

2359
01:43:05.500 --> 01:43:08.320
<v Speaker 3>And so that's what happens when you mess with God.</v>

2360
01:43:08.380 --> 01:43:10.420
<v Speaker 3>You find out things that you don't want to find out.</v>

2361
01:43:11.020 --> 01:43:14.740
<v Speaker 3>And so painting was not very happy when he started this discussion.</v>

2362
01:43:15.100 --> 01:43:16.960
<v Speaker 3>And when he's done with the discussion,</v>

2363
01:43:17.140 --> 01:43:18.730
<v Speaker 3>he's seriously not happy.</v>

2364
01:43:18.731 --> 01:43:21.070
<v Speaker 3>And the story says his countenance fell,</v>

2365
01:43:21.130 --> 01:43:25.600
<v Speaker 3>which means that he was enraged by that answer.</v>

2366
01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:28.750
<v Speaker 3>And no wonder because he's got the problem that he had before,</v>

2367
01:43:28.751 --> 01:43:30.730
<v Speaker 3>which is that everything's going to hell around him.</v>

2368
01:43:30.820 --> 01:43:34.260
<v Speaker 3>And his brother was thriving plus go on himself,</v>

2369
01:43:34.330 --> 01:43:38.110
<v Speaker 3>just told him that it's completely his fault and that he knows he's doing it and</v>

2370
01:43:38.111 --> 01:43:39.100
<v Speaker 3>then he chose to do it.</v>

2371
01:43:39.670 --> 01:43:40.503
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2372
01:43:41.080 --> 01:43:41.740
<v Speaker 3>what's,</v>

2373
01:43:41.740 --> 01:43:44.410
<v Speaker 3>what are you going to do in a situation like that?</v>

2374
01:43:44.770 --> 01:43:45.280
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2375
01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:46.570
<v Speaker 3>you do what people do.</v>

2376
01:43:46.840 --> 01:43:50.680
<v Speaker 3>You take a rock and you killed your brother.</v>

2377
01:43:51.620 --> 01:43:52.453
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2378
01:43:52.790 --> 01:43:53.810
<v Speaker 3>And that's what happens.</v>

2379
01:43:54.100 --> 01:43:54.830
<v Speaker 3>And that's it.</v>

2380
01:43:54.830 --> 01:43:57.890
<v Speaker 3>It's a horrifying story because it's really the first story.</v>

2381
01:43:59.070 --> 01:44:04.070
<v Speaker 3>And it's a story of Andy and hatred and murder and worse,</v>

2382
01:44:04.940 --> 01:44:09.940
<v Speaker 3>because what happens then is Katie is spared by God for complex reasons that we</v>

2383
01:44:10.251 --> 01:44:11.084
<v Speaker 3>won't get into them.</v>

2384
01:44:11.140 --> 01:44:15.170
<v Speaker 3>And then he goes out and has a family and he has his descendants and one of his</v>

2385
01:44:15.180 --> 01:44:19.460
<v Speaker 3>descendants as Tubal Cade and bulky and use the first person who makes weapons</v>

2386
01:44:19.461 --> 01:44:20.294
<v Speaker 3>of war.</v>

2387
01:44:20.990 --> 01:44:24.970
<v Speaker 3>So there's this idea that the corruption of the individual that rips represented</v>

2388
01:44:24.980 --> 01:44:27.200
<v Speaker 3>by Kane is part of the process.</v>

2389
01:44:27.201 --> 01:44:27.950
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>

2390
01:44:27.950 --> 01:44:29.990
<v Speaker 3>so there's more to that.</v>

2391
01:44:30.590 --> 01:44:31.423
<v Speaker 3>So if you,</v>

2392
01:44:32.120 --> 01:44:32.953
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

2393
01:44:32.990 --> 01:44:33.890
<v Speaker 3>it's so pain,</v>

2394
01:44:33.891 --> 01:44:35.220
<v Speaker 3>let's say kills you.</v>

2395
01:44:35.890 --> 01:44:40.890
<v Speaker 3>If you insult child and [inaudible] seven and if you insult Keynes,</v>

2396
01:44:42.051 --> 01:44:42.741
<v Speaker 3>grandchild,</v>

2397
01:44:42.741 --> 01:44:45.150
<v Speaker 3>then he kills 49 to two.</v>

2398
01:44:45.410 --> 01:44:48.080
<v Speaker 3>So there's this idea that this corrupt process,</v>

2399
01:44:48.081 --> 01:44:50.870
<v Speaker 3>that king part Tolkien expands exponentially,</v>

2400
01:44:50.871 --> 01:44:55.280
<v Speaker 3>I'll give to the community came judicial descendant is to Boucane who makes</v>

2401
01:44:55.281 --> 01:44:56.450
<v Speaker 3>weapons of war.</v>

2402
01:44:57.060 --> 01:44:57.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2403
01:44:57.370 --> 01:44:57.641
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2404
01:44:57.641 --> 01:45:02.641
<v Speaker 3>So does this direct line in the story between the Pauling vengeful nature of</v>

2405
01:45:03.791 --> 01:45:08.140
<v Speaker 3>cane and his jealousy and spite and refusal to take responsibility for the</v>

2406
01:45:08.141 --> 01:45:12.220
<v Speaker 3>consequences of his actions and inactions murder and genocide.</v>

2407
01:45:12.580 --> 01:45:14.620
<v Speaker 3>And it's all in like one paragraph.</v>

2408
01:45:14.710 --> 01:45:16.270
<v Speaker 3>It's absolutely overwhelming.</v>

2409
01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:18.940
<v Speaker 3>And the next story is the flood.</v>

2410
01:45:22.280 --> 01:45:23.113
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

2411
01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:27.440
<v Speaker 3>back to the high school shoes,</v>

2412
01:45:28.510 --> 01:45:31.130
<v Speaker 3>they're just acting out exactly the same old story.</v>

2413
01:45:31.730 --> 01:45:33.770
<v Speaker 3>It's the same thing over and over.</v>

2414
01:45:33.771 --> 01:45:35.380
<v Speaker 3>And that's why these stories are typical.</v>

2415
01:45:35.770 --> 01:45:37.340
<v Speaker 3>It's why we can never forget them.</v>

2416
01:45:37.970 --> 01:45:42.670
<v Speaker 3>They always happen and hope we need to come to understand that I'm just going to</v>

2417
01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:46.790
<v Speaker 3>have some possibility of avoiding the worst of the catastrophes.</v>

2418
01:45:47.660 --> 01:45:48.980
<v Speaker 3>High school shooters,</v>

2419
01:45:49.460 --> 01:45:50.900
<v Speaker 3>people like to call them my kids.</v>

2420
01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:52.970
<v Speaker 3>They wrote down what they did.</v>

2421
01:45:53.500 --> 01:45:54.230
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2422
01:45:54.230 --> 01:45:55.700
<v Speaker 3>as far as they were concerned,</v>

2423
01:45:56.240 --> 01:45:57.160
<v Speaker 3>they would reject it,</v>

2424
01:45:57.170 --> 01:45:58.340
<v Speaker 3>at least in part.</v>

2425
01:45:58.610 --> 01:45:58.941
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2426
01:45:58.941 --> 01:46:00.260
<v Speaker 3>people make much of that saying,</v>

2427
01:46:00.261 --> 01:46:03.010
<v Speaker 3>well the poor kids who were bullied and that's why they do prevent,</v>

2428
01:46:03.030 --> 01:46:06.140
<v Speaker 3>just like first of all the morning stuff and kids.</v>

2429
01:46:06.350 --> 01:46:07.370
<v Speaker 3>Second of all,</v>

2430
01:46:07.430 --> 01:46:11.630
<v Speaker 3>most people are voting and they don't want to blow up to high school.</v>

2431
01:46:11.631 --> 01:46:13.280
<v Speaker 3>And it wasn't just that they call them.</v>

2432
01:46:13.281 --> 01:46:15.950
<v Speaker 3>My kids wanted to go in there and kill.</v>

2433
01:46:16.190 --> 01:46:19.580
<v Speaker 3>That was only a tiny fraction of what they were planning in their fantasies.</v>

2434
01:46:19.581 --> 01:46:21.470
<v Speaker 3>They wanted to take out the whole city,</v>

2435
01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:22.460
<v Speaker 3>the entire city.</v>

2436
01:46:22.850 --> 01:46:26.780
<v Speaker 3>They have propane bones plans that they wanted to make a media spectacle.</v>

2437
01:46:26.781 --> 01:46:28.630
<v Speaker 3>It management quick attracted.</v>

2438
01:46:28.820 --> 01:46:32.480
<v Speaker 3>They want to produce as much mayhem as they possibly could in the shortest</v>

2439
01:46:32.481 --> 01:46:36.080
<v Speaker 3>possible period of time and cap it off with their own suicide.</v>

2440
01:46:36.110 --> 01:46:40.880
<v Speaker 3>Just to demonstrate how little they character the damn world and that's the</v>

2441
01:46:40.881 --> 01:46:42.920
<v Speaker 3>motivation behind that sort of thing.</v>

2442
01:46:43.130 --> 01:46:45.350
<v Speaker 3>It's a deep and dark motivation.</v>

2443
01:46:51.210 --> 01:46:55.710
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that's been helpful to me in studying all of this,</v>

2444
01:46:56.970 --> 01:46:58.170
<v Speaker 3>here's an idea.</v>

2445
01:46:59.010 --> 01:47:01.460
<v Speaker 3>Here's an idea that's expressed,</v>

2446
01:47:01.650 --> 01:47:02.790
<v Speaker 3>Christian symbolism.</v>

2447
01:47:04.290 --> 01:47:08.790
<v Speaker 3>There was an idea that Christ was crucified before he was taken to heaven,</v>

2448
01:47:08.820 --> 01:47:10.170
<v Speaker 3>had to go to hell.</v>

2449
01:47:10.650 --> 01:47:12.330
<v Speaker 3>That heroin hell let him rise.</v>

2450
01:47:12.450 --> 01:47:13.530
<v Speaker 3>It's a mythological idea.</v>

2451
01:47:13.531 --> 01:47:16.870
<v Speaker 3>It's not canonical biblical idea as far as I'm aware,</v>

2452
01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:18.850
<v Speaker 3>but there's an idea there.</v>

2453
01:47:19.110 --> 01:47:20.440
<v Speaker 3>If you want to move up,</v>

2454
01:47:20.550 --> 01:47:23.100
<v Speaker 3>you have to go down first and you kind of know this,</v>

2455
01:47:23.101 --> 01:47:23.311
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2456
01:47:23.311 --> 01:47:25.470
<v Speaker 3>Because most of the things that you've learned in your life,</v>

2457
01:47:25.890 --> 01:47:30.890
<v Speaker 3>you've learned the hard way and so most any culpable increased in wisdom tends</v>

2458
01:47:31.201 --> 01:47:33.170
<v Speaker 3>to come at a sacrificial costs.</v>

2459
01:47:33.550 --> 01:47:33.960
<v Speaker 3>It will,</v>

2460
01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:38.960
<v Speaker 3>you has to die and there's an intermediary period of chaos and horror and then</v>

2461
01:47:39.241 --> 01:47:43.990
<v Speaker 3>maybe come out of that your why is it more work together,</v>

2462
01:47:44.050 --> 01:47:45.210
<v Speaker 3>what you paid for it.</v>

2463
01:47:45.870 --> 01:47:46.800
<v Speaker 3>And so</v>

2464
01:47:48.330 --> 01:47:51.800
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that's being the consequence of that process for me is that,</v>

2465
01:47:51.810 --> 01:47:52.081
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2466
01:47:52.081 --> 01:47:53.280
<v Speaker 3>I've looked into these,</v>

2467
01:47:53.370 --> 01:47:56.610
<v Speaker 3>this motivation for an atrocity and I told you what I've included,</v>

2468
01:47:56.850 --> 01:47:58.170
<v Speaker 3>you could make about what you want,</v>

2469
01:47:58.171 --> 01:48:00.690
<v Speaker 3>but it's also done something very positive for me,</v>

2470
01:48:00.810 --> 01:48:02.910
<v Speaker 3>which is to shed light on something else,</v>

2471
01:48:02.970 --> 01:48:03.803
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

2472
01:48:03.900 --> 01:48:07.680
<v Speaker 3>well let's say you can declare this has to do with the solution of the problem,</v>

2473
01:48:07.710 --> 01:48:11.400
<v Speaker 3>but say you can detail about the problem and so I need to help out the problem.</v>

2474
01:48:11.610 --> 01:48:12.001
<v Speaker 3>If it's,</v>

2475
01:48:12.001 --> 01:48:13.520
<v Speaker 3>if it's detailed out property,</v>

2476
01:48:13.530 --> 01:48:15.620
<v Speaker 3>then there's a solution that emerges from it.</v>

2477
01:48:15.900 --> 01:48:18.870
<v Speaker 3>If you could identify the nature of true malevolence,</v>

2478
01:48:18.871 --> 01:48:21.570
<v Speaker 3>then you clarify the nature of its opposite,</v>

2479
01:48:21.571 --> 01:48:23.130
<v Speaker 3>which is whatever is good.</v>

2480
01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:26.010
<v Speaker 3>And then you can perhaps pursue that.</v>

2481
01:48:26.060 --> 01:48:29.440
<v Speaker 3>Perhaps that's how you can straight the malevolence whatever good is,</v>

2482
01:48:29.441 --> 01:48:30.720
<v Speaker 3>is not what he had.</v>

2483
01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:31.950
<v Speaker 3>It's the opposite of that.</v>

2484
01:48:31.970 --> 01:48:32.940
<v Speaker 3>And some would say,</v>

2485
01:48:33.060 --> 01:48:33.750
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2486
01:48:33.750 --> 01:48:34.860
<v Speaker 3>what do you do</v>

2487
01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:37.500
<v Speaker 3>instead of trending,</v>

2488
01:48:37.501 --> 01:48:39.630
<v Speaker 3>trending down the path of change.</v>

2489
01:48:41.130 --> 01:48:42.450
<v Speaker 3>And that's that is</v>

2490
01:48:44.700 --> 01:48:49.530
<v Speaker 3>you don't look for the insufficiency of the world in the structure of the world.</v>

2491
01:48:50.850 --> 01:48:54.390
<v Speaker 3>You look for the insufficiency of the structure of the world in you.</v>

2492
01:48:55.350 --> 01:48:58.050
<v Speaker 3>If things aren't going well enough for you,</v>

2493
01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:01.330
<v Speaker 3>then you have some work to do and you might pay well.</v>

2494
01:49:01.380 --> 01:49:04.920
<v Speaker 3>That's a hell of a thing happen because the world,</v>

2495
01:49:04.950 --> 01:49:09.720
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot to it and it's a rain against you in some many ways and there's no</v>

2496
01:49:09.721 --> 01:49:11.340
<v Speaker 3>doubt that that's the case.</v>

2497
01:49:11.910 --> 01:49:12.960
<v Speaker 3>You've got your options.</v>

2498
01:49:12.961 --> 01:49:17.961
<v Speaker 3>You can either pass your catastrophe at the feet of God and become bitter and</v>

2499
01:49:18.151 --> 01:49:22.530
<v Speaker 3>cruel and resentful and worse as a constant lines or you can take it upon</v>

2500
01:49:22.531 --> 01:49:26.820
<v Speaker 3>yourself to improve what you improve and also assume that the same time that</v>

2501
01:49:26.821 --> 01:49:31.710
<v Speaker 3>there's enough to you that you can actually bench and CSA which regards to</v>

2502
01:49:31.730 --> 01:49:33.180
<v Speaker 3>malevolence itself.</v>

2503
01:49:33.450 --> 01:49:36.660
<v Speaker 3>You can look for that upside of yourself and there's evidence for it outside of</v>

2504
01:49:36.661 --> 01:49:37.470
<v Speaker 3>yourself,</v>

2505
01:49:37.470 --> 01:49:40.710
<v Speaker 3>and then you can go after those people that you regard as particularly</v>

2506
01:49:40.711 --> 01:49:43.230
<v Speaker 3>malevolent and straighten the world up that way.</v>

2507
01:49:43.290 --> 01:49:45.600
<v Speaker 3>But that's how insurance develop.</v>

2508
01:49:45.870 --> 01:49:46.141
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2509
01:49:46.141 --> 01:49:47.850
<v Speaker 3>and there's a better idea,</v>

2510
01:49:47.870 --> 01:49:52.240
<v Speaker 3>which is you might want to look to yourself first and see just how much of that</v>

2511
01:49:52.241 --> 01:49:54.190
<v Speaker 3>you can constraint inside yourself.</v>

2512
01:49:54.250 --> 01:49:57.860
<v Speaker 3>Start before you start worrying about how much of that younger the constraint it</v>

2513
01:49:57.861 --> 01:49:58.694
<v Speaker 3>under people.</v>

2514
01:49:59.230 --> 01:50:03.400
<v Speaker 3>And so that's why you need to send your house in perfect order before he</v>

2515
01:50:03.401 --> 01:50:04.690
<v Speaker 3>criticized the world.</v>

2516
01:50:04.870 --> 01:50:09.760
<v Speaker 3>Because all of that sounded to me that unless you want things to go down the</v>

2517
01:50:09.761 --> 01:50:10.594
<v Speaker 3>pathway,</v>

2518
01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:14.530
<v Speaker 3>the cane I would go on and the people still go down constantly.</v>

2519
01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:17.860
<v Speaker 3>There might making everything worse for them,</v>

2520
01:50:17.861 --> 01:50:18.820
<v Speaker 3>for their families,</v>

2521
01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:19.901
<v Speaker 3>for the community,</v>

2522
01:50:19.901 --> 01:50:20.920
<v Speaker 3>for the world.</v>

2523
01:50:20.950 --> 01:50:24.080
<v Speaker 3>You have the alternative of taking all of that onto yourself,</v>

2524
01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:25.250
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2525
01:50:25.250 --> 01:50:26.650
<v Speaker 3>And so that's fine.</v>

2526
01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:31.330
<v Speaker 3>In our most profound transformative stories,</v>

2527
01:50:31.331 --> 01:50:36.331
<v Speaker 3>let's say the person who revives me the world is the person who voluntarily</v>

2528
01:50:37.630 --> 01:50:39.310
<v Speaker 3>accepts their own vulnerability.</v>

2529
01:50:39.940 --> 01:50:42.890
<v Speaker 3>That's what's symbolized by the crucifixion.</v>

2530
01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:47.500
<v Speaker 3>That's why that symbol as Gregory Poole for 2000 years,</v>

2531
01:50:48.340 --> 01:50:53.340
<v Speaker 3>since the proper pathway is to take on your mortality as your responsibility.</v>

2532
01:50:55.870 --> 01:50:57.220
<v Speaker 3>And the second is to</v>

2533
01:50:59.400 --> 01:51:00.233
<v Speaker 3>seven.</v>

2534
01:51:04.010 --> 01:51:05.270
<v Speaker 3>How would I put this</v>

2535
01:51:14.570 --> 01:51:19.480
<v Speaker 3>to notice that the temptation that's laid out by the spirit of malevolence is it</v>

2536
01:51:19.481 --> 01:51:24.481
<v Speaker 3>temptation that you confront that you have to take responsibility for it and</v>

2537
01:51:24.621 --> 01:51:26.330
<v Speaker 3>then you have to attain victory over?</v>

2538
01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:30.980
<v Speaker 3>It's a psychological drama and that's the story that sits as the boy and what</v>

2539
01:51:30.981 --> 01:51:35.800
<v Speaker 3>her culture with its emphasis on the divinity of the individual isn't the</v>

2540
01:51:35.810 --> 01:51:37.280
<v Speaker 3>suffering of the individual.</v>

2541
01:51:37.370 --> 01:51:38.203
<v Speaker 3>It's divine.</v>

2542
01:51:38.390 --> 01:51:40.390
<v Speaker 3>It's not the malevolence of the individual,</v>

2543
01:51:40.460 --> 01:51:41.293
<v Speaker 3>it's divine.</v>

2544
01:51:41.570 --> 01:51:45.580
<v Speaker 3>It's the capacity of the individual in principle to accept both of those into,</v>

2545
01:51:45.581 --> 01:51:46.940
<v Speaker 3>to work for the remediation.</v>

2546
01:51:47.510 --> 01:51:51.360
<v Speaker 3>And that's the story that allows us our natural rights and our,</v>

2547
01:51:51.740 --> 01:51:55.310
<v Speaker 3>and the responsibility that we have taught ourselves into our families,</v>

2548
01:51:55.311 --> 01:51:56.180
<v Speaker 3>into the community.</v>

2549
01:51:56.660 --> 01:52:01.510
<v Speaker 3>And it's the acting out of that story that produces individuals who are helping</v>

2550
01:52:01.511 --> 01:52:02.300
<v Speaker 3>them thrive.</v>

2551
01:52:02.300 --> 01:52:06.560
<v Speaker 3>Families that work and surviving in communities that are integral and don't</v>

2552
01:52:06.561 --> 01:52:08.850
<v Speaker 3>degenerate into something resembling health.</v>

2553
01:52:09.620 --> 01:52:11.300
<v Speaker 3>And it's important as Carl,</v>

2554
01:52:11.301 --> 01:52:16.301
<v Speaker 3>you don't point it out for us to wake up because we're so powerful now we need</v>

2555
01:52:18.021 --> 01:52:21.740
<v Speaker 3>to wake up and we need to understand what it is that we'd be doing right and</v>

2556
01:52:21.750 --> 01:52:26.750
<v Speaker 3>wrong for all of this time and to implement that as consciously and clearheaded</v>

2557
01:52:27.351 --> 01:52:32.351
<v Speaker 3>Layton intentively properly as we possibly can individualize and to see what</v>

2558
01:52:33.831 --> 01:52:35.180
<v Speaker 3>great things might happen.</v>

2559
01:52:35.420 --> 01:52:35.971
<v Speaker 3>How's it going?</v>

2560
01:52:35.971 --> 01:52:37.400
<v Speaker 3>Some points if you did so</v>

2561
01:52:39.770 --> 01:52:44.770
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2562
01:53:02.740 --> 01:53:03.573
<v Speaker 1>it's so</v>

2563
01:53:05.210 --> 01:53:09.650
<v Speaker 1>hard from the stage for a couple of minutes and they're going to set it up again</v>

2564
01:53:10.010 --> 01:53:13.910
<v Speaker 1>in a slightly different format and then I'm going to come out with my laptop and</v>

2565
01:53:13.940 --> 01:53:14.960
<v Speaker 1>you've all provided.</v>

2566
01:53:15.020 --> 01:53:16.590
<v Speaker 1>Many of you have provided the questions.</v>

2567
01:53:17.130 --> 01:53:21.290
<v Speaker 1>We're going to spend half an hour with the questions and the answers that will</v>

2568
01:53:21.291 --> 01:53:22.730
<v Speaker 1>bring the evening to a close.</v>

2569
01:53:23.300 --> 01:53:23.680
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

2570
01:53:23.680 --> 01:53:28.680
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2571
01:54:00.630 --> 01:54:01.463
<v Speaker 1>wonderful.</v>

2572
01:54:01.520 --> 01:54:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Standing on</v>

2573
01:54:05.880 --> 01:54:06.713
<v Speaker 1>your shoulders back</v>

2574
01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:17.800
<v Speaker 1>a little bit for some of the questions that you guys had already submitted.</v>

2575
01:54:26.780 --> 01:54:27.613
<v Speaker 1>The</v>

2576
01:54:29.230 --> 01:54:31.290
<v Speaker 1>sewer is amazing,</v>

2577
01:54:31.690 --> 01:54:33.340
<v Speaker 1>just it's incredible.</v>

2578
01:54:33.590 --> 01:54:35.570
<v Speaker 1>It's exceeded all our expectations.</v>

2579
01:54:36.590 --> 01:54:38.160
<v Speaker 1>This is now the fifth show.</v>

2580
01:54:38.380 --> 01:54:39.213
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2581
01:54:39.470 --> 01:54:44.470
<v Speaker 1>currently scheduled 40 shows us also going to London next week.</v>

2582
01:54:45.500 --> 01:54:47.570
<v Speaker 1>We are adding shows all the time.</v>

2583
01:54:47.630 --> 01:54:47.901
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2584
01:54:47.901 --> 01:54:50.770
<v Speaker 1>they've been adding cities or returning to this.</v>

2585
01:54:50.780 --> 01:54:53.590
<v Speaker 1>He said they sent a sold very well.</v>

2586
01:54:53.600 --> 01:54:57.120
<v Speaker 1>We sold out all by shows and every night is,</v>

2587
01:54:57.470 --> 01:54:59.210
<v Speaker 1>his presentation has been different.</v>

2588
01:54:59.720 --> 01:55:01.730
<v Speaker 1>It's been a different subject matter.</v>

2589
01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:05.030
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to return to some shows in the future that they're going to be</v>

2590
01:55:05.031 --> 01:55:05.864
<v Speaker 1>very different.</v>

2591
01:55:09.830 --> 01:55:13.100
<v Speaker 1>He is so inclusive.</v>

2592
01:55:13.490 --> 01:55:14.790
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't cross the aisles.</v>

2593
01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:16.130
<v Speaker 1>It crosses oceans.</v>

2594
01:55:16.131 --> 01:55:19.640
<v Speaker 1>We had people here from Russia and community shows already.</v>

2595
01:55:19.641 --> 01:55:20.474
<v Speaker 1>Just the first slide.</v>

2596
01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:21.313
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>

2597
01:55:21.350 --> 01:55:22.183
<v Speaker 1>Japan,</v>

2598
01:55:22.430 --> 01:55:23.031
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2599
01:55:23.031 --> 01:55:23.990
<v Speaker 1>of course Canada.</v>

2600
01:55:24.220 --> 01:55:24.590
<v Speaker 1>How many,</v>

2601
01:55:24.590 --> 01:55:25.790
<v Speaker 1>many Canadians here tonight.</v>

2602
01:55:32.040 --> 01:55:32.873
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2603
01:55:33.790 --> 01:55:34.623
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2604
01:55:37.920 --> 01:55:42.920
<v Speaker 1>I really do like it and we're just seeing the beginning of a,</v>

2605
01:55:43.220 --> 01:55:46.750
<v Speaker 1>the positive nature of it and the healthy and I'm sure a a lot.</v>

2606
01:55:46.770 --> 01:55:47.603
<v Speaker 1>You'd be home.</v>

2607
01:55:47.610 --> 01:55:51.300
<v Speaker 1>We'll continue to bring in a lot of other people in the states around the world.</v>

2608
01:55:51.980 --> 01:55:52.813
<v Speaker 1>It's just amazing,</v>

2609
01:55:53.490 --> 01:55:55.530
<v Speaker 1>except the book trade is going to translate as well.</v>

2610
01:55:55.750 --> 01:55:56.570
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2611
01:55:56.570 --> 01:55:57.650
<v Speaker 1>someone was in our minds,</v>

2612
01:55:57.700 --> 01:55:58.890
<v Speaker 1>seven countries in the Arabic,</v>

2613
01:55:58.891 --> 01:56:00.690
<v Speaker 1>so it will be everywhere.</v>

2614
01:56:00.850 --> 01:56:01.050
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2615
01:56:01.050 --> 01:56:01.883
<v Speaker 1>various,</v>

2616
01:56:02.510 --> 01:56:03.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2617
01:56:03.210 --> 01:56:03.940
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

2618
01:56:03.940 --> 01:56:04.500
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2619
01:56:04.500 --> 01:56:06.720
<v Speaker 1>what he's made to sit down and you're ready to start with the Q and.</v>

2620
01:56:06.721 --> 01:56:07.554
<v Speaker 1>A and again,</v>

2621
01:56:07.650 --> 01:56:10.860
<v Speaker 1>please welcome back to the stage Dr. Jordan Peterson.</v>

2622
01:56:11.120 --> 01:56:16.120
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

2623
01:56:36.310 --> 01:56:37.590
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

2624
01:56:40.720 --> 01:56:41.553
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

2625
01:56:52.660 --> 01:56:57.280
<v Speaker 2>how long a person go about finding your calling purpose or passion?</v>

2626
01:56:58.360 --> 01:56:58.511
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2627
01:56:58.511 --> 01:56:59.920
<v Speaker 2>are you going to say bagging?</v>

2628
01:57:00.570 --> 01:57:01.403
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2629
01:57:02.110 --> 01:57:03.490
<v Speaker 2>because what the hell do you know?</v>

2630
01:57:05.340 --> 01:57:08.230
<v Speaker 2>I agree being a technical as well.</v>

2631
01:57:09.730 --> 01:57:13.290
<v Speaker 2>So I have this program called the cell phones program.</v>

2632
01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:19.160
<v Speaker 2>Its components is the future authoring programs and it asks people to consider</v>

2633
01:57:20.411 --> 01:57:24.010
<v Speaker 2>their lives deeply and to develop a vision and a strategy.</v>

2634
01:57:24.640 --> 01:57:27.730
<v Speaker 2>And it's not an easy,</v>

2635
01:57:29.320 --> 01:57:31.570
<v Speaker 2>did have someone who hasn't been encouraged,</v>

2636
01:57:31.571 --> 01:57:35.110
<v Speaker 2>let's say self position because they're non practice data.</v>

2637
01:57:35.980 --> 01:57:36.431
<v Speaker 2>People say,</v>

2638
01:57:36.431 --> 01:57:38.260
<v Speaker 2>well I don't know what I should be doing.</v>

2639
01:57:38.620 --> 01:57:39.070
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2640
01:57:39.070 --> 01:57:39.610
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2641
01:57:39.610 --> 01:57:39.911
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2642
01:57:39.911 --> 01:57:41.530
<v Speaker 2>some things she shouldn't be doing.</v>

2643
01:57:41.531 --> 01:57:42.730
<v Speaker 2>So that's a good start.</v>

2644
01:57:42.731 --> 01:57:46.120
<v Speaker 2>And I don't mean that in the most practical manner.</v>

2645
01:57:46.150 --> 01:57:47.140
<v Speaker 2>If you don't know what to do,</v>

2646
01:57:47.141 --> 01:57:50.710
<v Speaker 2>you could start by stopping doing all the stupid things that you're doing that</v>

2647
01:57:50.711 --> 01:57:51.610
<v Speaker 2>you know are stupid.</v>

2648
01:57:52.120 --> 01:57:54.880
<v Speaker 2>And that's a good start because it starts to clear your vision.</v>

2649
01:57:55.570 --> 01:57:56.403
<v Speaker 2>So if you,</v>

2650
01:57:56.650 --> 01:57:58.270
<v Speaker 2>if you don't know what to do,</v>

2651
01:57:58.570 --> 01:58:01.400
<v Speaker 2>but I do know that you're doing things that you're ashamed of and that you</v>

2652
01:58:01.401 --> 01:58:02.410
<v Speaker 2>regret.</v>

2653
01:58:02.590 --> 01:58:07.590
<v Speaker 2>You could start by just eliminating employed by one and slowly given it to the</v>

2654
01:58:08.381 --> 01:58:09.700
<v Speaker 2>best of your ability.</v>

2655
01:58:10.300 --> 01:58:11.570
<v Speaker 2>And then as you're,</v>

2656
01:58:11.610 --> 01:58:14.590
<v Speaker 2>and so that's really a vendor is starting to become disciplined to false of</v>

2657
01:58:14.591 --> 01:58:15.411
<v Speaker 2>ethical rules,</v>

2658
01:58:15.411 --> 01:58:15.611
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

2659
01:58:15.611 --> 01:58:20.200
<v Speaker 2>some set of ethical rules with any logic to follow a set of ethical rules long</v>

2660
01:58:20.201 --> 01:58:20.471
<v Speaker 2>enough,</v>

2661
01:58:20.471 --> 01:58:21.670
<v Speaker 2>then you'll get disciplined enough.</v>

2662
01:58:21.671 --> 01:58:25.420
<v Speaker 2>So you'll start to have a clearer vision and then you might be able to see the</v>

2663
01:58:25.421 --> 01:58:30.421
<v Speaker 2>way forward for you might see a way forward port for intensity rather than</v>

2664
01:58:31.961 --> 01:58:33.400
<v Speaker 2>merely what you should avoid.</v>

2665
01:58:33.430 --> 01:58:35.440
<v Speaker 2>So that's a good initial practical issue.</v>

2666
01:58:35.441 --> 01:58:36.470
<v Speaker 2>It's about,</v>

2667
01:58:36.650 --> 01:58:40.410
<v Speaker 2>because everyone knows you know perfectly well that there are things you're</v>

2668
01:58:40.420 --> 01:58:42.180
<v Speaker 2>doing that you know you shouldn't do it,</v>

2669
01:58:42.940 --> 01:58:44.360
<v Speaker 2>but you don't stop,</v>

2670
01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:47.890
<v Speaker 2>start stopping</v>

2671
01:58:49.470 --> 01:58:54.470
<v Speaker 2>because part of this idea about putting your house in perfect order before you</v>

2672
01:58:55.061 --> 01:58:56.290
<v Speaker 2>criticize the world,</v>

2673
01:58:56.320 --> 01:58:57.280
<v Speaker 2>because there's a question,</v>

2674
01:58:57.281 --> 01:58:58.120
<v Speaker 2>it's always open.</v>

2675
01:58:58.740 --> 01:58:59.310
<v Speaker 2>And as far as,</v>

2676
01:58:59.310 --> 01:59:00.190
<v Speaker 2>this is the question,</v>

2677
01:59:00.191 --> 01:59:00.761
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

2678
01:59:00.761 --> 01:59:02.470
<v Speaker 2>that God placed in front of cake.</v>

2679
01:59:02.471 --> 01:59:03.304
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2680
01:59:03.490 --> 01:59:03.641
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2681
01:59:03.641 --> 01:59:06.010
<v Speaker 2>how do you know the world would be a terrific place if he weren't such a</v>

2682
01:59:06.011 --> 01:59:06.970
<v Speaker 2>wretched thing?</v>

2683
01:59:08.200 --> 01:59:09.280
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it wouldn't be.</v>

2684
01:59:10.720 --> 01:59:11.201
<v Speaker 2>He might say,</v>

2685
01:59:11.201 --> 01:59:11.321
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2686
01:59:11.321 --> 01:59:12.580
<v Speaker 2>that's a pretty casual answer.</v>

2687
01:59:12.620 --> 01:59:16.210
<v Speaker 2>Would you say to people who has a parent who's dying with Alzheimer's disease</v>

2688
01:59:16.211 --> 01:59:16.871
<v Speaker 2>for example?</v>

2689
01:59:16.871 --> 01:59:19.570
<v Speaker 2>It's like whether you can get their act together and he's going to fix that,</v>

2690
01:59:19.571 --> 01:59:22.510
<v Speaker 2>looks like it would make it a hell of a lot better than it wouldn't be</v>

2691
01:59:22.511 --> 01:59:23.021
<v Speaker 2>otherwise.</v>

2692
01:59:23.021 --> 01:59:24.160
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you that.</v>

2693
01:59:24.300 --> 01:59:28.240
<v Speaker 2>And that's something because it's bad enough to have someone who's dead deal and</v>

2694
01:59:28.270 --> 01:59:32.290
<v Speaker 2>your family without having an incredibly amount of unnecessary pathology</v>

2695
01:59:32.291 --> 01:59:35.970
<v Speaker 2>gathered around that and make something that could be merely tragic into</v>

2696
01:59:35.980 --> 01:59:37.390
<v Speaker 2>something that's outright hell.</v>

2697
01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:39.730
<v Speaker 2>And that happens to people all the time.</v>

2698
01:59:40.420 --> 01:59:44.740
<v Speaker 2>And so even if it's not a perfect solution,</v>

2699
01:59:44.741 --> 01:59:46.510
<v Speaker 2>is the best solution that you have.</v>

2700
01:59:46.960 --> 01:59:51.220
<v Speaker 2>And then the next part of that is when I suggest to people that they do the</v>

2701
01:59:51.221 --> 01:59:53.590
<v Speaker 2>future authoring program and they're,</v>

2702
01:59:53.650 --> 01:59:55.510
<v Speaker 2>they're leery about doing it.</v>

2703
01:59:56.740 --> 02:00:01.740
<v Speaker 2>I asked them to do it bad because a bad plan is waving the didn't know plan</v>

2704
02:00:04.060 --> 02:00:09.060
<v Speaker 2>because if you implemented that plan then you learn why ain't you that plan.</v>

2705
02:00:09.400 --> 02:00:10.040
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2706
02:00:10.040 --> 02:00:14.200
<v Speaker 2>Not Hypothetically but exactly in New Orleans and then in and use that</v>

2707
02:00:14.201 --> 02:00:18.760
<v Speaker 2>information above her failure to retool the better acquire.</v>

2708
02:00:18.820 --> 02:00:21.080
<v Speaker 2>And so the English men pageant,</v>

2709
02:00:21.081 --> 02:00:21.350
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2710
02:00:21.350 --> 02:00:23.010
<v Speaker 2>you're tracking the destination,</v>

2711
02:00:23.011 --> 02:00:23.591
<v Speaker 2>it's moving,</v>

2712
02:00:23.591 --> 02:00:26.810
<v Speaker 2>there's some kind of ideal in your vision is blurry,</v>

2713
02:00:26.811 --> 02:00:30.160
<v Speaker 2>they don't know where to look so you're going to go this way and then you can go</v>

2714
02:00:30.161 --> 02:00:30.740
<v Speaker 2>that way.</v>

2715
02:00:30.740 --> 02:00:31.810
<v Speaker 2>We can go this way.</v>

2716
02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:35.950
<v Speaker 2>But if you keep doing that then the deviations from the right path agreed to</v>

2717
02:00:35.951 --> 02:00:40.450
<v Speaker 2>decrease with time and eventually you'll be walking forward in an efficient</v>

2718
02:00:40.451 --> 02:00:44.470
<v Speaker 2>manner and you might have to get all sorts of errors before you manage that.</v>

2719
02:00:44.620 --> 02:00:48.400
<v Speaker 2>But I watched people long enough in my clinical practice to know that waiting</v>

2720
02:00:48.401 --> 02:00:53.260
<v Speaker 2>for Godot and a very bad idea and non growing up as a very bad idea.</v>

2721
02:00:53.261 --> 02:00:55.670
<v Speaker 2>It's like implement the best plan that has to happen</v>

2722
02:00:57.280 --> 02:01:02.260
<v Speaker 2>and learn from and that works and you get sharper at making your planets.</v>

2723
02:01:02.830 --> 02:01:06.400
<v Speaker 2>And then the other thing that we do in the future of your program does what we</v>

2724
02:01:06.401 --> 02:01:06.911
<v Speaker 2>ask people,</v>

2725
02:01:06.911 --> 02:01:11.911
<v Speaker 2>well maybe you can't decide what your passion or your calling should be.</v>

2726
02:01:12.790 --> 02:01:14.470
<v Speaker 2>That's a pretty global question.</v>

2727
02:01:15.430 --> 02:01:18.910
<v Speaker 2>But you might ask yourself some questions like,</v>

2728
02:01:19.570 --> 02:01:23.530
<v Speaker 2>well is there something you could do to improve your intimate relationship?</v>

2729
02:01:24.130 --> 02:01:24.761
<v Speaker 2>One thing,</v>

2730
02:01:24.761 --> 02:01:28.090
<v Speaker 2>is there a way that you can improve your friendships?</v>

2731
02:01:28.240 --> 02:01:31.930
<v Speaker 2>Is there something you can do at your job that would make it better than it is</v>

2732
02:01:31.990 --> 02:01:32.710
<v Speaker 2>now?</v>

2733
02:01:32.710 --> 02:01:34.420
<v Speaker 2>Even if it's something incremental,</v>

2734
02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:38.920
<v Speaker 2>could you do something more productive and meaningful with your time outside of,</v>

2735
02:01:39.590 --> 02:01:40.100
<v Speaker 2>could you be</v>

2736
02:01:40.100 --> 02:01:43.870
<v Speaker 4>slightly better at handling temptations that come your way?</v>

2737
02:01:44.480 --> 02:01:46.930
<v Speaker 4>Could you take care of herself somewhat?</v>

2738
02:01:46.940 --> 02:01:48.470
<v Speaker 4>You better be mentally and physically.</v>

2739
02:01:48.860 --> 02:01:51.260
<v Speaker 4>But you know the answers to all of those questions is Jeffery.</v>

2740
02:01:51.290 --> 02:01:51.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2741
02:01:51.630 --> 02:01:54.680
<v Speaker 4>So then you can even ask themselves a simpler question,</v>

2742
02:01:55.370 --> 02:01:56.360
<v Speaker 4>which would be,</v>

2743
02:01:56.520 --> 02:01:56.690
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2744
02:01:56.690 --> 02:02:00.650
<v Speaker 4>if there is something that you could do that would make one post things better,</v>

2745
02:02:00.680 --> 02:02:03.490
<v Speaker 4>is there also something they wouldn't do?</v>

2746
02:02:04.390 --> 02:02:06.320
<v Speaker 4>And then you can ask yourself that,</v>

2747
02:02:06.640 --> 02:02:06.960
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2748
02:02:06.960 --> 02:02:08.960
<v Speaker 4>instead of telling yourself that you should,</v>

2749
02:02:08.961 --> 02:02:10.620
<v Speaker 4>which is the same thing,</v>

2750
02:02:10.710 --> 02:02:11.151
<v Speaker 4>might say,</v>

2751
02:02:11.151 --> 02:02:15.080
<v Speaker 4>well I would like my marriage because you said you ask yourself,</v>

2752
02:02:15.081 --> 02:02:16.440
<v Speaker 4>well how can my marriage be better?</v>

2753
02:02:16.640 --> 02:02:20.120
<v Speaker 4>And you'll get a bunch of answers and most of you will like because if you</v>

2754
02:02:20.121 --> 02:02:22.400
<v Speaker 4>really ask yourself a question like that,</v>

2755
02:02:22.630 --> 02:02:23.421
<v Speaker 4>the part of our brain,</v>

2756
02:02:23.421 --> 02:02:24.490
<v Speaker 4>this is management doesn't,</v>

2757
02:02:24.540 --> 02:02:25.670
<v Speaker 4>it's looking for new answers,</v>

2758
02:02:25.671 --> 02:02:26.650
<v Speaker 4>will tell you.</v>

2759
02:02:26.710 --> 02:02:29.570
<v Speaker 4>And then we'll tell you a bunch of things you don't want to hear and Lord of</v>

2760
02:02:29.571 --> 02:02:31.400
<v Speaker 4>them won't be things you already know.</v>

2761
02:02:31.520 --> 02:02:34.400
<v Speaker 4>And some of what we think speakers just no damn way you we get to know,</v>

2762
02:02:34.401 --> 02:02:35.330
<v Speaker 4>you know that you should.</v>

2763
02:02:35.900 --> 02:02:36.511
<v Speaker 4>But some,</v>

2764
02:02:36.511 --> 02:02:40.820
<v Speaker 4>some said that those might be things that you should do that by your definition</v>

2765
02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:42.920
<v Speaker 4>that you actually would do.</v>

2766
02:02:43.010 --> 02:02:45.950
<v Speaker 4>It might be trivial or books or guilt,</v>

2767
02:02:46.030 --> 02:02:50.840
<v Speaker 4>but at least a step in the right direction so he would never step in the right</v>

2768
02:02:50.841 --> 02:02:51.321
<v Speaker 4>direction.</v>

2769
02:02:51.321 --> 02:02:56.321
<v Speaker 4>You're willing to take day by day and that's incremental progress.</v>

2770
02:02:57.090 --> 02:02:58.460
<v Speaker 4>It'll spiral.</v>

2771
02:02:59.530 --> 02:03:00.510
<v Speaker 4>It goes firewall,</v>

2772
02:03:00.570 --> 02:03:02.150
<v Speaker 4>and there's a stake in the New Testament,</v>

2773
02:03:02.190 --> 02:03:03.980
<v Speaker 4>which actually happens to be true statement,</v>

2774
02:03:03.981 --> 02:03:08.920
<v Speaker 4>which is to those who have everything more will be given and it's a,</v>

2775
02:03:08.930 --> 02:03:11.750
<v Speaker 4>it's a reflection of his underlying phenomenon.</v>

2776
02:03:12.320 --> 02:03:12.851
<v Speaker 4>Phenomenon.</v>

2777
02:03:12.851 --> 02:03:14.580
<v Speaker 4>It looks like the natural law schools,</v>

2778
02:03:14.581 --> 02:03:17.060
<v Speaker 4>it's as things start to recruit to you,</v>

2779
02:03:17.210 --> 02:03:19.200
<v Speaker 4>the rate at which they need further,</v>

2780
02:03:19.201 --> 02:03:21.050
<v Speaker 4>the crew will increase.</v>

2781
02:03:21.400 --> 02:03:23.130
<v Speaker 4>That's a natural law school price.</v>

2782
02:03:23.131 --> 02:03:25.680
<v Speaker 4>As long as sometimes great opens,</v>

2783
02:03:25.690 --> 02:03:27.620
<v Speaker 4>it reflect or just confusion.</v>

2784
02:03:27.621 --> 02:03:31.330
<v Speaker 4>So there's a chapter promos for polite,</v>

2785
02:03:31.340 --> 02:03:32.173
<v Speaker 4>calm down.</v>

2786
02:03:32.720 --> 02:03:34.100
<v Speaker 4>Don't compare yourself.</v>

2787
02:03:34.190 --> 02:03:36.200
<v Speaker 4>Compare yourself and who you were yesterday,</v>

2788
02:03:36.201 --> 02:03:38.330
<v Speaker 4>not someone else's today.</v>

2789
02:03:38.510 --> 02:03:40.790
<v Speaker 4>And it's a new junction for incremental improvement.</v>

2790
02:03:41.030 --> 02:03:42.210
<v Speaker 4>If you don't know where to go,</v>

2791
02:03:42.211 --> 02:03:43.044
<v Speaker 4>when you like,</v>

2792
02:03:43.180 --> 02:03:46.370
<v Speaker 4>think about where you are and see if today you could make,</v>

2793
02:03:46.430 --> 02:03:50.510
<v Speaker 4>where do you want somewhat better when something is so that when you go to bed</v>

2794
02:03:50.511 --> 02:03:51.170
<v Speaker 4>at night,</v>

2795
02:03:51.170 --> 02:03:54.080
<v Speaker 4>you're not asking Richard as you were when you woke up in the morning.</v>

2796
02:03:54.690 --> 02:03:57.050
<v Speaker 4>And so if you do that for two years,</v>

2797
02:03:57.490 --> 02:03:59.720
<v Speaker 4>you know what do you make it a just a small thing,</v>

2798
02:03:59.721 --> 02:04:01.780
<v Speaker 4>something you could actually do that you wouldn't do,</v>

2799
02:04:02.030 --> 02:04:06.140
<v Speaker 4>then your life will be waiting here and at the end of that you might have enough</v>

2800
02:04:06.141 --> 02:04:10.280
<v Speaker 4>clarity of mind to start to understand where you would go if things worked out</v>

2801
02:04:10.281 --> 02:04:11.450
<v Speaker 4>for you across the world.</v>

2802
02:04:12.320 --> 02:04:14.840
<v Speaker 4>So that's the answer.</v>

2803
02:04:23.410 --> 02:04:24.243
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2804
02:04:25.960 --> 02:04:29.410
<v Speaker 4>How do we encourage others to fix themselves as they reduce personal</v>

2805
02:04:29.411 --> 02:04:34.411
<v Speaker 4>responsibility or blame idiot lords with Ruth the system for all their trouble</v>

2806
02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:36.160
<v Speaker 4>by example.</v>

2807
02:04:37.380 --> 02:04:38.970
<v Speaker 4>That's the best way to do it.</v>

2808
02:04:39.300 --> 02:04:41.860
<v Speaker 4>You know there's another new of injunction,</v>

2809
02:04:42.200 --> 02:04:43.033
<v Speaker 4>rather harsh</v>

2810
02:04:45.930 --> 02:04:46.711
<v Speaker 4>don't cows.</v>

2811
02:04:46.711 --> 02:04:50.790
<v Speaker 4>Pearls will force one and took me a long time to understand that because he</v>

2812
02:04:50.791 --> 02:04:52.140
<v Speaker 4>really is a harsh statement.</v>

2813
02:04:52.890 --> 02:04:53.730
<v Speaker 4>But here's the,</v>

2814
02:04:53.790 --> 02:04:54.810
<v Speaker 4>here's the gist of it.</v>

2815
02:04:55.410 --> 02:04:57.580
<v Speaker 4>If you're talking to someone and they're not distinct,</v>

2816
02:04:57.600 --> 02:04:58.650
<v Speaker 4>you should shut up.</v>

2817
02:05:00.230 --> 02:05:02.120
<v Speaker 4>It's really hard thing to learn because you think,</v>

2818
02:05:02.121 --> 02:05:02.410
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2819
02:05:02.410 --> 02:05:03.720
<v Speaker 4>I just keep telling this person,</v>

2820
02:05:03.721 --> 02:05:05.280
<v Speaker 4>they'll listen if I no they won't.</v>

2821
02:05:05.490 --> 02:05:07.350
<v Speaker 4>They're shelf will just get harder.</v>

2822
02:05:07.410 --> 02:05:09.060
<v Speaker 4>And so here's what's happening.</v>

2823
02:05:09.061 --> 02:05:10.920
<v Speaker 4>If you're talking to someone and they're not listening,</v>

2824
02:05:11.610 --> 02:05:13.230
<v Speaker 4>you are not receiving thinks you are.</v>

2825
02:05:13.860 --> 02:05:15.600
<v Speaker 4>That's why they're not listening.</v>

2826
02:05:15.720 --> 02:05:17.910
<v Speaker 4>You're actually wrong in a local situation.</v>

2827
02:05:17.970 --> 02:05:19.260
<v Speaker 4>Now they might also be wrong,</v>

2828
02:05:19.261 --> 02:05:21.060
<v Speaker 4>but what are you going to do about that?</v>

2829
02:05:21.840 --> 02:05:23.410
<v Speaker 4>But you could show me wrong.</v>

2830
02:05:23.640 --> 02:05:25.740
<v Speaker 4>And so if you try a couple of times,</v>

2831
02:05:25.950 --> 02:05:29.070
<v Speaker 4>say you were telling me some things to a family member for their own good and</v>

2832
02:05:29.071 --> 02:05:31.830
<v Speaker 4>maybe you actually are and maybe it's for their own good and maybe they should</v>

2833
02:05:31.831 --> 02:05:33.840
<v Speaker 4>listen and maybe you're right and all of those things,</v>

2834
02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:38.770
<v Speaker 4>but they're not busy and he told him like six times or nothing's out put telling</v>

2835
02:05:38.771 --> 02:05:40.740
<v Speaker 4>me it isn't working.</v>

2836
02:05:41.280 --> 02:05:43.740
<v Speaker 4>The problem isn't the problem you think it is.</v>

2837
02:05:43.890 --> 02:05:45.450
<v Speaker 4>That's why your approach is working.</v>

2838
02:05:45.840 --> 02:05:47.940
<v Speaker 4>And so one of the things you could do with a situation like that,</v>

2839
02:05:47.941 --> 02:05:48.660
<v Speaker 4>it's quick,</v>

2840
02:05:48.660 --> 02:05:49.980
<v Speaker 4>just quit doing it.</v>

2841
02:05:50.030 --> 02:05:53.790
<v Speaker 4>And I would say pull back from the person and watch.</v>

2842
02:05:54.270 --> 02:05:55.320
<v Speaker 4>Don't offer them anything.</v>

2843
02:05:55.321 --> 02:05:56.890
<v Speaker 4>Don't tell them your wisdom,</v>

2844
02:05:56.970 --> 02:05:58.230
<v Speaker 4>give them any advice,</v>

2845
02:05:58.440 --> 02:05:59.760
<v Speaker 4>tell him anything about yourself.</v>

2846
02:06:00.330 --> 02:06:02.180
<v Speaker 4>Just watch and listen.</v>

2847
02:06:02.690 --> 02:06:05.040
<v Speaker 4>If you do that for like a year,</v>

2848
02:06:05.610 --> 02:06:08.330
<v Speaker 4>they will tell you what's wrong with them and case.</v>

2849
02:06:09.240 --> 02:06:13.500
<v Speaker 4>But that will only happen if you prick casting pearls before swine.</v>

2850
02:06:14.250 --> 02:06:14.761
<v Speaker 4>And then you say,</v>

2851
02:06:14.761 --> 02:06:14.881
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2852
02:06:14.881 --> 02:06:17.880
<v Speaker 4>let's say you have someone in your family just absolutely intractable,</v>

2853
02:06:17.881 --> 02:06:21.090
<v Speaker 4>they're just not changing and nothing you can do is going to fix that.</v>

2854
02:06:21.091 --> 02:06:22.620
<v Speaker 4>And that's unbelievably common.</v>

2855
02:06:23.030 --> 02:06:24.900
<v Speaker 4>So like what can you do?</v>

2856
02:06:24.990 --> 02:06:29.730
<v Speaker 4>Well maybe not because people have a guesstimate and there's might be that and</v>

2857
02:06:29.731 --> 02:06:32.190
<v Speaker 4>you might not be the person who could do anything about that.</v>

2858
02:06:32.490 --> 02:06:35.640
<v Speaker 4>And so you don't want to destroy yourself.</v>

2859
02:06:35.700 --> 02:06:38.840
<v Speaker 4>You know how you approach someone who's drumming,</v>

2860
02:06:39.030 --> 02:06:40.070
<v Speaker 4>the panicking,</v>

2861
02:06:40.740 --> 02:06:42.210
<v Speaker 4>you approach the lift your foot up,</v>

2862
02:06:42.510 --> 02:06:47.100
<v Speaker 4>swimming this way towards and you do that because,</v>

2863
02:06:47.101 --> 02:06:49.560
<v Speaker 4>and you tell them you have to stop panicking or I'm up.</v>

2864
02:06:49.561 --> 02:06:50.580
<v Speaker 4>Or the risk of VTE.</v>

2865
02:06:51.330 --> 02:06:54.420
<v Speaker 4>And the reason is because drunk people is not better than one.</v>

2866
02:06:55.200 --> 02:06:56.730
<v Speaker 4>And you don't have to tell them that recently.</v>

2867
02:06:56.820 --> 02:06:57.653
<v Speaker 4>But you could</v>

2868
02:06:59.880 --> 02:07:04.880
<v Speaker 4>if there's someone that you did with is attracted or sacrificing yourself and</v>

2869
02:07:05.701 --> 02:07:08.250
<v Speaker 4>also being part of that attracted the problem.</v>

2870
02:07:08.280 --> 02:07:09.540
<v Speaker 4>It's not helpful.</v>

2871
02:07:10.380 --> 02:07:15.380
<v Speaker 4>So you do what you can and you live by example and maybe if the person has any</v>

2872
02:07:17.010 --> 02:07:22.010
<v Speaker 4>chance they watch you and maybe they have to watch it for 10 years and they</v>

2873
02:07:22.501 --> 02:07:24.570
<v Speaker 4>learn or they fail to learn,</v>

2874
02:07:24.870 --> 02:07:27.060
<v Speaker 4>in which case you've done it again.</v>

2875
02:07:28.320 --> 02:07:29.730
<v Speaker 4>And that's how it is.</v>

2876
02:07:31.740 --> 02:07:32.720
<v Speaker 4>So he's his function.</v>

2877
02:07:32.721 --> 02:07:33.840
<v Speaker 4>It's sound</v>

2878
02:07:38.590 --> 02:07:39.920
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2879
02:07:45.350 --> 02:07:48.760
<v Speaker 4>on the 17 year old girl.</v>

2880
02:07:52.590 --> 02:07:54.090
<v Speaker 4>Well maybe it is,</v>

2881
02:07:54.091 --> 02:07:55.320
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think it is.</v>

2882
02:07:55.920 --> 02:07:56.830
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

2883
02:07:56.920 --> 02:07:59.640
<v Speaker 4>there's this idea that the only people who are listening to me or,</v>

2884
02:07:59.641 --> 02:08:00.840
<v Speaker 4>hey Barry white men</v>

2885
02:08:06.730 --> 02:08:11.730
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2886
02:08:17.480 --> 02:08:18.500
<v Speaker 1>as far as I'm concerned,</v>

2887
02:08:18.740 --> 02:08:20.740
<v Speaker 4>and this is just so observes the,</v>

2888
02:08:21.620 --> 02:08:25.400
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe that this is easy to become controversial and talking to people</v>

2889
02:08:25.401 --> 02:08:30.401
<v Speaker 4>about taking responsibility for the state of the world onto themselves and the</v>

2890
02:08:31.550 --> 02:08:32.940
<v Speaker 4>radical leftist identity.</v>

2891
02:08:32.960 --> 02:08:33.771
<v Speaker 4>All it politics.</v>

2892
02:08:33.771 --> 02:08:37.940
<v Speaker 4>Any alarms can only do this through the lens of the radical left has an identity</v>

2893
02:08:37.941 --> 02:08:42.941
<v Speaker 4>politics instead of noticing that this isn't a political issue except that I</v>

2894
02:08:43.281 --> 02:08:46.200
<v Speaker 4>don't like the radical leftists and their restrictions on pricing.</v>

2895
02:08:46.270 --> 02:08:51.270
<v Speaker 1>Thanks [inaudible].</v>

2896
02:08:57.330 --> 02:08:58.163
<v Speaker 4>For me,</v>

2897
02:08:59.620 --> 02:09:00.453
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2898
02:09:00.580 --> 02:09:05.580
<v Speaker 4>it's boundaries for politicians just started the new things that they don't get</v>

2899
02:09:05.971 --> 02:09:10.971
<v Speaker 4>to do it stepping [inaudible] realm or these fits into the theological realm and</v>

2900
02:09:11.911 --> 02:09:13.830
<v Speaker 4>they should stay the hell out of the bowl.</v>

2901
02:09:14.030 --> 02:09:19.030
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2902
02:09:21.730 --> 02:09:22.380
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

2903
02:09:22.380 --> 02:09:24.170
<v Speaker 4>you're no longer where you should.</v>

2904
02:09:24.370 --> 02:09:28.160
<v Speaker 4>You've transformed yourself into a target and not a good time.</v>

2905
02:09:28.390 --> 02:09:29.790
<v Speaker 4>Not that there is a good content.</v>

2906
02:09:30.310 --> 02:09:34.740
<v Speaker 4>So now the consequences are harvest</v>

2907
02:09:36.280 --> 02:09:39.470
<v Speaker 4>because I've been objected to that.</v>

2908
02:09:39.650 --> 02:09:39.930
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2909
02:09:39.930 --> 02:09:41.920
<v Speaker 4>separately him with a fair degree of success,</v>

2910
02:09:44.890 --> 02:09:46.510
<v Speaker 4>the only response that can be mounted,</v>

2911
02:09:46.511 --> 02:09:47.400
<v Speaker 4>listen to this monster,</v>

2912
02:09:47.610 --> 02:09:48.980
<v Speaker 4>is this within two,</v>

2913
02:09:49.030 --> 02:09:50.080
<v Speaker 4>maybe conceptualizations.</v>

2914
02:09:50.081 --> 02:09:51.880
<v Speaker 4>I've got them identity politics.</v>

2915
02:09:51.940 --> 02:09:52.571
<v Speaker 4>So it,</v>

2916
02:09:52.571 --> 02:09:53.800
<v Speaker 4>since I'm objecting to that,</v>

2917
02:09:53.801 --> 02:09:56.770
<v Speaker 4>then I must be the reprehensible engine.</v>

2918
02:09:57.090 --> 02:09:57.430
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2919
02:09:57.430 --> 02:09:58.240
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2920
02:09:58.240 --> 02:09:59.120
<v Speaker 4>good luck the facts.</v>

2921
02:09:59.840 --> 02:10:02.560
<v Speaker 4>It's not going to work out because that is what's going on.</v>

2922
02:10:02.830 --> 02:10:05.500
<v Speaker 4>So and so to the 17 year old girl.</v>

2923
02:10:05.530 --> 02:10:06.280
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2924
02:10:06.280 --> 02:10:10.000
<v Speaker 4>who knows how many 17 year old girls are paid attention to what I'm saying on</v>

2925
02:10:10.001 --> 02:10:10.780
<v Speaker 4>aging?</v>

2926
02:10:10.780 --> 02:10:12.580
<v Speaker 4>I would say it's in the tens of thousands,</v>

2927
02:10:12.700 --> 02:10:14.380
<v Speaker 4>perhaps hundreds of thousands.</v>

2928
02:10:14.381 --> 02:10:16.810
<v Speaker 4>And so the mere fact that that isn't the story,</v>

2929
02:10:16.820 --> 02:10:21.820
<v Speaker 4>that a small subsection of the ideological he committed popular media is telling</v>

2930
02:10:23.571 --> 02:10:23.980
<v Speaker 4>him to serve.</v>

2931
02:10:23.980 --> 02:10:27.190
<v Speaker 4>By no means all of them by any stretch of the imagination does feed it's</v>

2932
02:10:27.250 --> 02:10:28.220
<v Speaker 4>economically true.</v>

2933
02:10:28.750 --> 02:10:31.330
<v Speaker 4>So now we might be rare.</v>

2934
02:10:31.600 --> 02:10:33.650
<v Speaker 4>Statistically speaking for olds,</v>

2935
02:10:33.800 --> 02:10:34.633
<v Speaker 4>listen to me,</v>

2936
02:10:35.520 --> 02:10:37.790
<v Speaker 4>I give ever served them all the time.</v>

2937
02:10:38.180 --> 02:10:40.070
<v Speaker 4>More power to in as far as I'm concerned,</v>

2938
02:10:40.071 --> 02:10:41.900
<v Speaker 4>it's a complicated message.</v>

2939
02:10:42.180 --> 02:10:47.000
<v Speaker 4>The lectures are very sophisticated and difficult and it's great that if you're,</v>

2940
02:10:47.020 --> 02:10:49.730
<v Speaker 4>if you happen to find that your interest is captured by them,</v>

2941
02:10:49.900 --> 02:10:51.260
<v Speaker 4>then there's something to that.</v>

2942
02:10:51.920 --> 02:10:53.480
<v Speaker 4>What advice would I have for teens?</v>

2943
02:10:53.481 --> 02:10:55.970
<v Speaker 4>Like you do what you think's right,</v>

2944
02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:56.833
<v Speaker 4>Kiddo.</v>

2945
02:10:57.410 --> 02:11:02.410
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2946
02:11:08.020 --> 02:11:08.970
<v Speaker 4>in 12 rules.</v>

2947
02:11:08.971 --> 02:11:12.480
<v Speaker 4>You mentioned that people can go this quit your teaching to be hell to pay.</v>

2948
02:11:13.110 --> 02:11:14.250
<v Speaker 4>I think I noticed why,</v>

2949
02:11:14.260 --> 02:11:15.570
<v Speaker 4>but say why.</v>

2950
02:11:16.430 --> 02:11:17.263
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2951
02:11:18.510 --> 02:11:23.510
<v Speaker 4>I read a lot of critiques of Carl Young and he's often accused of doing all of</v>

2952
02:11:23.701 --> 02:11:26.000
<v Speaker 4>the malicious things like start to help.</v>

2953
02:11:26.010 --> 02:11:26.843
<v Speaker 4>For example.</v>

2954
02:11:27.060 --> 02:11:27.810
<v Speaker 4>Are you talking about man,</v>

2955
02:11:27.810 --> 02:11:28.600
<v Speaker 4>one of those critiques,</v>

2956
02:11:28.600 --> 02:11:31.110
<v Speaker 4>I thought you actually understood what he was up to.</v>

2957
02:11:31.970 --> 02:11:34.920
<v Speaker 4>What you're doing is like accusing ambassador of chain walking.</v>

2958
02:11:36.240 --> 02:11:41.210
<v Speaker 4>What he was doing was so valuable that like starting a health that's,</v>

2959
02:11:41.640 --> 02:11:43.710
<v Speaker 4>that's not even in the same conceptual universe.</v>

2960
02:11:44.060 --> 02:11:47.480
<v Speaker 4>Partly where you'll get to starting to do is to put the metaphysical</v>

2961
02:11:47.560 --> 02:11:48.410
<v Speaker 4>substructure back.</v>

2962
02:11:48.411 --> 02:11:52.220
<v Speaker 4>I'm in Western civilization and to the degree that I'm,</v>

2963
02:11:52.420 --> 02:11:53.051
<v Speaker 4>I'm just still,</v>

2964
02:11:53.051 --> 02:11:56.340
<v Speaker 4>but he was up doing to development to something green can be communicated</v>

2965
02:11:56.341 --> 02:11:57.174
<v Speaker 4>effectively.</v>

2966
02:11:57.210 --> 02:12:00.780
<v Speaker 4>Then there's also what I've been trying to do for 30 years and I'd be trying to</v>

2967
02:12:00.781 --> 02:12:04.260
<v Speaker 4>do it because I studied what I told you I was studying at the beginning of this</v>

2968
02:12:04.261 --> 02:12:05.094
<v Speaker 4>tall.</v>

2969
02:12:05.160 --> 02:12:08.490
<v Speaker 4>I looked at the worst things that I see that people were capable of doing.</v>

2970
02:12:08.760 --> 02:12:12.540
<v Speaker 4>And I look at them for a very long time and I tried to understand why they were</v>

2971
02:12:12.541 --> 02:12:15.930
<v Speaker 4>doing and then and they me.</v>

2972
02:12:16.770 --> 02:12:19.110
<v Speaker 4>And then I tried to figure out what the alternative was.</v>

2973
02:12:20.340 --> 02:12:23.640
<v Speaker 4>And so I'd be laying on an alternative because that's what we need to learn for</v>

2974
02:12:23.641 --> 02:12:24.960
<v Speaker 4>what happened in the 20th century.</v>

2975
02:12:25.260 --> 02:12:28.880
<v Speaker 4>We need to learn the alternative to what happened in the Soviet Union.</v>

2976
02:12:29.240 --> 02:12:31.830
<v Speaker 4>And we need to learn the alternative to what happened in Nazi Germany.</v>

2977
02:12:32.200 --> 02:12:35.070
<v Speaker 4>And listen what happened in Nazi Germany to have,</v>

2978
02:12:35.120 --> 02:12:36.480
<v Speaker 4>and again on this,</v>

2979
02:12:36.481 --> 02:12:39.600
<v Speaker 4>we want what happened in the Soviet Union to happen again.</v>

2980
02:12:39.780 --> 02:12:43.140
<v Speaker 4>We need to learn are less and so,</v>

2981
02:12:43.180 --> 02:12:45.330
<v Speaker 4>and the lesson is an individual lesson,</v>

2982
02:12:45.331 --> 02:12:46.350
<v Speaker 4>not an elective list.</v>

2983
02:12:46.740 --> 02:12:49.650
<v Speaker 4>And I believe this to be empirically the case.</v>

2984
02:12:50.160 --> 02:12:54.480
<v Speaker 4>Why is this commentators that I grabbed on Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union</v>

2985
02:12:54.750 --> 02:12:56.340
<v Speaker 4>have all come to the same conclusion.</v>

2986
02:12:56.910 --> 02:13:01.110
<v Speaker 4>The reason those tyrannies could exist and maintain yourselves and then do the</v>

2987
02:13:01.111 --> 02:13:05.060
<v Speaker 4>murderous things that they did was because the individuals that compose those</v>

2988
02:13:05.061 --> 02:13:07.350
<v Speaker 4>societies rejected their moral,</v>

2989
02:13:07.440 --> 02:13:11.700
<v Speaker 4>individual moral responsibility and allowing those to test case to take place.</v>

2990
02:13:11.940 --> 02:13:13.560
<v Speaker 4>And I believe that to be the case.</v>

2991
02:13:13.650 --> 02:13:15.000
<v Speaker 4>I take what you got west.</v>

2992
02:13:15.060 --> 02:13:19.860
<v Speaker 4>What we got right in the West is the idea of that the political system,</v>

2993
02:13:20.100 --> 02:13:21.210
<v Speaker 4>the economic system,</v>

2994
02:13:21.211 --> 02:13:22.290
<v Speaker 4>the familial system,</v>

2995
02:13:22.470 --> 02:13:25.320
<v Speaker 4>all of that rests on your shoulders.</v>

2996
02:13:25.500 --> 02:13:27.600
<v Speaker 4>You're corruption corrupts everything.</v>

2997
02:13:28.330 --> 02:13:31.080
<v Speaker 4>You're [inaudible] and that's a terrible,</v>

2998
02:13:31.670 --> 02:13:34.260
<v Speaker 4>but it also something that gives you some to take to.</v>

2999
02:13:34.350 --> 02:13:36.390
<v Speaker 4>It turns out that you are,</v>

3000
02:13:36.620 --> 02:13:38.110
<v Speaker 4>or you might say,</v>

3001
02:13:38.990 --> 02:13:42.830
<v Speaker 4>well that's all I ever wanted to know that I'm important that I haven't put rule</v>

3002
02:13:42.840 --> 02:13:43.450
<v Speaker 4>delights like,</v>

3003
02:13:43.450 --> 02:13:44.150
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3004
02:13:44.150 --> 02:13:47.510
<v Speaker 4>you better think that through because there's,</v>

3005
02:13:47.550 --> 02:13:49.140
<v Speaker 4>there's two ways this works.</v>

3006
02:13:49.350 --> 02:13:52.650
<v Speaker 4>Either you're a Dusko and everything you do is meaningless and who the hell</v>

3007
02:13:52.651 --> 02:13:53.220
<v Speaker 4>cares?</v>

3008
02:13:53.220 --> 02:13:57.740
<v Speaker 4>What difference is it going to make it a million years or everything you do not.</v>

3009
02:13:57.990 --> 02:13:59.220
<v Speaker 4>And when you make a mistake,</v>

3010
02:13:59.250 --> 02:14:03.300
<v Speaker 4>everything shapes and that's how you make a mistake.</v>

3011
02:14:03.480 --> 02:14:03.970
<v Speaker 4>Everything</v>

3012
02:14:03.970 --> 02:14:08.970
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

3013
02:14:14.160 --> 02:14:14.811
<v Speaker 4>guilty about it.</v>

3014
02:14:14.811 --> 02:14:19.100
<v Speaker 4>If that wasn't the case and you do feel talking about at that guiltless counter</v>

3015
02:14:19.101 --> 02:14:23.130
<v Speaker 4>escape from that killed except by stopping stopping those things.</v>

3016
02:14:23.580 --> 02:14:24.630
<v Speaker 4>So it's filtering.</v>

3017
02:14:25.220 --> 02:14:28.520
<v Speaker 4>So that's why I say we're going to be helping people notice what I teach it</v>

3018
02:14:28.550 --> 02:14:31.260
<v Speaker 4>because like that's a hell of a thing to teach.</v>

3019
02:14:31.860 --> 02:14:33.670
<v Speaker 4>It's a healthy thing to realize yourself.</v>

3020
02:14:34.110 --> 02:14:37.740
<v Speaker 4>It's partly why I'm trying to be careful with what I say because I've learned</v>

3021
02:14:37.741 --> 02:14:38.910
<v Speaker 4>that I should be careful</v>

3022
02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:39.850
<v Speaker 1>with what you're saying.</v>

3023
02:14:43.480 --> 02:14:48.070
<v Speaker 4>Is it hard for me to be away from my briefing while my wife's comes along with</v>

3024
02:14:48.071 --> 02:14:48.820
<v Speaker 4>me?</v>

3025
02:14:48.820 --> 02:14:49.653
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

3026
02:14:49.740 --> 02:14:54.740
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

3027
02:15:02.040 --> 02:15:02.873
<v Speaker 4>patients with her,</v>

3028
02:15:03.130 --> 02:15:08.130
<v Speaker 4>which is like a 16 hour a day occupation because our life is very complicated</v>

3029
02:15:09.611 --> 02:15:12.560
<v Speaker 4>and I'm very complicated with</v>

3030
02:15:14.900 --> 02:15:17.450
<v Speaker 4>all the complexity and she also has to put up with me.</v>

3031
02:15:17.560 --> 02:15:18.710
<v Speaker 4>That's not an easy thing.</v>

3037
02:15:41.480 --> 02:15:42.760
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to spend more time with them.</v>

3038
02:15:43.700 --> 02:15:48.700
<v Speaker 4>When I get home and we get along just fine and they're supporting what I'm doing</v>

3053
02:16:53.640 --> 02:16:54.660
<v Speaker 4>is helpful.</v>

3054
02:16:56.880 --> 02:16:57.713
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3055
02:16:58.740 --> 02:16:59.930
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know what to say about</v>

3056

<v Speaker 4>Well there a chapter in your old 12 call.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Sorry,</v>

3066
02:17:27.840 --> 02:17:28.673
<v Speaker 4>chapter</v>

3067
02:17:32.280 --> 02:17:35.250
<v Speaker 4>soon that the person knows something you don't,</v>

3068
02:17:35.430 --> 02:17:35.700
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3069
02:17:35.700 --> 02:17:38.220
<v Speaker 4>so I'm going to tell the story about the marriage.</v>

3070
02:17:38.920 --> 02:17:40.360
<v Speaker 4>This is tiny.</v>

3071
02:17:40.520 --> 02:17:41.190
<v Speaker 4>Cool.</v>

3072
02:17:41.190 --> 02:17:42.980
<v Speaker 4>So I had,</v>

3073
02:17:43.020 --> 02:17:45.740
<v Speaker 4>this is wild curls.</v>

3074
02:17:46.090 --> 02:17:50.060
<v Speaker 4>He went to sweet get married because he's Swedish,</v>

3075
02:17:50.180 --> 02:17:51.470
<v Speaker 4>Swedish Canadian,</v>

3076
02:17:52.270 --> 02:17:53.103
<v Speaker 4>and</v>

3077
02:17:54.230 --> 02:17:54.920
<v Speaker 4>you're married.</v>

3078
02:17:54.920 --> 02:17:55.753
<v Speaker 4>Ceremony.</v>

3079
02:17:56.770 --> 02:18:00.670
<v Speaker 4>The apple had to hold accountable on being married.</v>

3080
02:18:00.671 --> 02:18:03.940
<v Speaker 4>You're taking your balances and that was very interesting to me.</v>

3081
02:18:04.890 --> 02:18:05.723
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3082
02:18:06.360 --> 02:18:08.500
<v Speaker 4>in the Christian symbolic world,</v>

3083
02:18:08.570 --> 02:18:11.340
<v Speaker 4>marriage is a sacrament of the sacred.</v>

3084
02:18:11.740 --> 02:18:14.800
<v Speaker 4>What'd you need to do some big acts you about it can fundamental and knocked to</v>

3085
02:18:14.801 --> 02:18:15.400
<v Speaker 4>be mass.</v>

3086
02:18:15.400 --> 02:18:17.640
<v Speaker 4>The cows maybe of course.</v>

3087
02:18:17.641 --> 02:18:18.451
<v Speaker 4>That's what you assume.</v>

3088
02:18:18.451 --> 02:18:19.550
<v Speaker 4>When you take the bottom,</v>

3089
02:18:20.550 --> 02:18:24.300
<v Speaker 4>you're going to make this a foundation that you don't shake.</v>

3090
02:18:24.710 --> 02:18:28.670
<v Speaker 4>You found when you were kind of to yourself on your,</v>

3091
02:18:28.970 --> 02:18:30.810
<v Speaker 4>absolutely stayed to yourself on it.</v>

3092
02:18:31.290 --> 02:18:32.480
<v Speaker 4>One of the things about God,</v>

3093
02:18:32.490 --> 02:18:34.200
<v Speaker 4>and this is worth knowing perhaps,</v>

3094
02:18:34.201 --> 02:18:36.990
<v Speaker 4>especially to the people in this audience who haven't been married yet,</v>

3095
02:18:36.991 --> 02:18:39.270
<v Speaker 4>but maybe to those of people who are already married,</v>

3096
02:18:39.800 --> 02:18:44.800
<v Speaker 4>there's an idea which is your marriage cannot work unless you're all in.</v>

3097
02:18:46.260 --> 02:18:46.501
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

3098
02:18:46.501 --> 02:18:48.250
<v Speaker 4>what about has he falls,</v>

3099
02:18:48.270 --> 02:18:51.420
<v Speaker 4>let's say monogamous powers are very common around the world,</v>

3100
02:18:51.421 --> 02:18:51.751
<v Speaker 4>by the way.</v>

3101
02:18:51.751 --> 02:18:53.100
<v Speaker 4>I made a lot more the society,</v>

3102
02:18:53.230 --> 02:18:56.280
<v Speaker 4>but they tend to be very unstable for all sorts of complicated reasons.</v>

3103
02:18:56.281 --> 02:19:01.281
<v Speaker 4>So there's a strong proclivity towards social enforcement all coming along and</v>

3104
02:19:02.220 --> 02:19:05.480
<v Speaker 4>there's a strong need to make it in viola.</v>

3105
02:19:05.720 --> 02:19:07.860
<v Speaker 4>Now there's a psychological reason for that,</v>

3106
02:19:07.890 --> 02:19:10.500
<v Speaker 4>which is that you are not going to be committed enough to,</v>

3107
02:19:10.501 --> 02:19:13.770
<v Speaker 4>your partner will take care of them unless you bloody well know you wanted to</v>

3108
02:19:13.771 --> 02:19:17.880
<v Speaker 4>shut it off without you are shocking to the inescapable lead for the rest of</v>

3109
02:19:17.881 --> 02:19:18.714
<v Speaker 4>your life.</v>

3110
02:19:19.660 --> 02:19:22.330
<v Speaker 4>Why are you going to be serious enough about it?</v>

3111
02:19:22.331 --> 02:19:22.630
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3112
02:19:22.630 --> 02:19:22.921
<v Speaker 4>really?</v>

3113
02:19:22.921 --> 02:19:25.200
<v Speaker 4>I have to put up with you for like 50 years.</v>

3114
02:19:25.500 --> 02:19:29.990
<v Speaker 4>We better get our in order because otherwise he's going to be some spice in hell</v>

3115
02:19:30.050 --> 02:19:34.640
<v Speaker 4>because you're just screwed up in a horrible as Nisha so,</v>

3116
02:19:35.150 --> 02:19:36.560
<v Speaker 4>so is that something that's very,</v>

3117
02:19:36.561 --> 02:19:37.394
<v Speaker 4>very seriously.</v>

3118
02:19:37.410 --> 02:19:39.320
<v Speaker 4>So He'd go with your partner has a problem.</v>

3119
02:19:39.330 --> 02:19:40.430
<v Speaker 4>If you have a problem,</v>

3120
02:19:40.580 --> 02:19:43.850
<v Speaker 4>you want to solve that because otherwise you're going to have it maybe every day</v>

3121
02:19:43.851 --> 02:19:44.750
<v Speaker 4>for the rest of your life.</v>

3122
02:19:44.990 --> 02:19:45.621
<v Speaker 4>And you might think,</v>

3123
02:19:45.621 --> 02:19:45.771
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3124
02:19:45.771 --> 02:19:48.290
<v Speaker 4>I don't have to because I can run away and find someone else.</v>

3125
02:19:48.310 --> 02:19:48.621
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3126
02:19:48.621 --> 02:19:48.771
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3127
02:19:48.771 --> 02:19:52.030
<v Speaker 4>good luck with that because they're going to come with just as many flaws</v>

3128
02:19:52.090 --> 02:19:56.600
<v Speaker 4>probably as you have probably as your partner has given to bring all your</v>

3129
02:19:56.601 --> 02:19:57.371
<v Speaker 4>insecurities.</v>

3130
02:19:57.371 --> 02:19:59.370
<v Speaker 4>Media sees into the new relationship anyway,</v>

3131
02:19:59.380 --> 02:20:00.201
<v Speaker 4>so listen,</v>

3132
02:20:00.201 --> 02:20:01.090
<v Speaker 4>want to be alone,</v>

3133
02:20:01.100 --> 02:20:05.180
<v Speaker 4>which is still picking again generally a fairly quick route to kind of insanity.</v>

3134
02:20:05.240 --> 02:20:09.610
<v Speaker 4>Then you're pretty much stuck with the fact that you have flaws in them anyways,</v>

3135
02:20:09.630 --> 02:20:12.670
<v Speaker 4>so they're standing with this candle bones.</v>

3136
02:20:12.830 --> 02:20:13.850
<v Speaker 4>Here's the IBM.</v>

3137
02:20:14.230 --> 02:20:15.260
<v Speaker 4>It's the same ideas.</v>

3138
02:20:15.290 --> 02:20:16.450
<v Speaker 4>Can't believe Christmas,</v>

3139
02:20:17.130 --> 02:20:17.921
<v Speaker 4>so complicated,</v>

3140
02:20:17.921 --> 02:20:18.711
<v Speaker 4>but you know something,</v>

3141
02:20:18.711 --> 02:20:18.801
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

3142
02:20:18.801 --> 02:20:19.880
<v Speaker 4>most of you act out</v>

3143
02:20:21.920 --> 02:20:23.020
<v Speaker 4>in the darkness of the way.</v>

3144
02:20:23.021 --> 02:20:26.370
<v Speaker 4>Can you bring the tree inside was what the hell are you up to if you don't know</v>

3145
02:20:26.380 --> 02:20:27.320
<v Speaker 4>what to do it anyways,</v>

3146
02:20:28.160 --> 02:20:30.140
<v Speaker 4>but a bunch of lights in it because of course,</v>

3147
02:20:30.290 --> 02:20:32.570
<v Speaker 4>what do you want to do when you bring the tree in your house and she would</v>

3148
02:20:32.600 --> 02:20:33.050
<v Speaker 4>light.</v>

3149
02:20:33.050 --> 02:20:34.850
<v Speaker 4>That stands to reason,</v>

3150
02:20:34.851 --> 02:20:35.151
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3151
02:20:35.151 --> 02:20:35.984
<v Speaker 4>And when does it,</v>

3152
02:20:36.490 --> 02:20:36.890
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3153
02:20:36.890 --> 02:20:40.490
<v Speaker 4>you don't know why it was to symbolize illumination in darkness.</v>

3154
02:20:40.730 --> 02:20:41.300
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>

3155
02:20:41.300 --> 02:20:41.600
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3156
02:20:41.600 --> 02:20:42.170
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

3157
02:20:42.170 --> 02:20:43.280
<v Speaker 4>it's a pagan ritual,</v>

3158
02:20:43.281 --> 02:20:44.480
<v Speaker 4>but it's being Christianized.</v>

3159
02:20:44.870 --> 02:20:48.950
<v Speaker 4>You put an angel perhaps if the top of the tree to signified that which is at</v>

3160
02:20:48.951 --> 02:20:53.450
<v Speaker 4>the top of a news and you celebrate the reemergence of the light and the dark</v>

3161
02:20:53.451 --> 02:20:53.840
<v Speaker 4>areas.</v>

3162
02:20:53.840 --> 02:20:55.430
<v Speaker 4>So it's a little ritual.</v>

3163
02:20:55.670 --> 02:20:59.740
<v Speaker 4>It's 80 back laying up in the world in terms of good and evil with lightning,</v>

3164
02:20:59.780 --> 02:21:01.400
<v Speaker 4>good darkness be evil.</v>

3165
02:21:01.940 --> 02:21:05.300
<v Speaker 4>And it's a good thing to do in the winter because it's dark and you're also</v>

3166
02:21:05.301 --> 02:21:07.190
<v Speaker 4>celebrating to be birds of the sonnets.</v>

3167
02:21:07.430 --> 02:21:07.761
<v Speaker 4>Very,</v>

3168
02:21:07.761 --> 02:21:08.594
<v Speaker 4>very complicated.</v>

3169
02:21:09.560 --> 02:21:14.050
<v Speaker 4>So the category in the tree is a sight and vision,</v>

3170
02:21:14.130 --> 02:21:16.040
<v Speaker 4>like it's a Christmas tree.</v>

3171
02:21:16.041 --> 02:21:19.580
<v Speaker 4>So it's associated with the idea of the birth of the mythological hero for the</v>

3172
02:21:19.581 --> 02:21:20.091
<v Speaker 4>Messiah.</v>

3173
02:21:20.091 --> 02:21:20.820
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>

3174
02:21:20.820 --> 02:21:24.460
<v Speaker 4>And so you're doing all that at the same time right now for celebration mode</v>

3175
02:21:24.530 --> 02:21:27.650
<v Speaker 4>because it's a great thing when a new hero inches the world.</v>

3176
02:21:28.040 --> 02:21:31.700
<v Speaker 4>That's what happens when you give birth to a child was the child has,</v>

3177
02:21:32.420 --> 02:21:35.310
<v Speaker 4>is a locus of divine consciousness is,</v>

3178
02:21:35.390 --> 02:21:40.390
<v Speaker 4>is that birth like putting different logical hero always is because he's small</v>

3179
02:21:40.520 --> 02:21:44.450
<v Speaker 4>and fragile and all of that hopefully goes up to do great things.</v>

3180
02:21:44.510 --> 02:21:46.160
<v Speaker 4>So that's all tangled up in that.</v>

3181
02:21:46.310 --> 02:21:48.170
<v Speaker 4>So the,</v>

3182
02:21:48.560 --> 02:21:53.120
<v Speaker 4>the candle is a simple of the light in the world and the light in the world is,</v>

3183
02:21:53.121 --> 02:21:54.430
<v Speaker 4>but there's a logical here at work,</v>

3184
02:21:54.431 --> 02:21:56.090
<v Speaker 4>it's Christ and the Christian drama.</v>

3185
02:21:56.091 --> 02:21:57.410
<v Speaker 4>So we'll use that.</v>

3186
02:21:57.560 --> 02:22:01.280
<v Speaker 4>So you hold the camera above your head when you're getting married to symbolize</v>

3187
02:22:01.340 --> 02:22:03.260
<v Speaker 4>what you are subordinate to.</v>

3188
02:22:04.220 --> 02:22:04.881
<v Speaker 4>Because you might say,</v>

3189
02:22:04.881 --> 02:22:05.631
<v Speaker 4>what did the marriage,</v>

3190
02:22:05.631 --> 02:22:05.841
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3191
02:22:05.841 --> 02:22:07.420
<v Speaker 4>the wife is subordinate to the husband.</v>

3192
02:22:07.490 --> 02:22:11.630
<v Speaker 4>That's the claim that's put out by those who think that marriage is a</v>

3193
02:22:11.631 --> 02:22:12.261
<v Speaker 4>patriarchal,</v>

3194
02:22:12.261 --> 02:22:13.910
<v Speaker 4>oppressive institution,</v>

3195
02:22:13.970 --> 02:22:15.260
<v Speaker 4>which it is by the way,</v>

3196
02:22:15.360 --> 02:22:16.193
<v Speaker 4>which you know,</v>

3197
02:22:16.250 --> 02:22:20.270
<v Speaker 4>because the only people that get married now are rich people and rich people</v>

3198
02:22:20.300 --> 02:22:23.210
<v Speaker 4>don't oppress themselves as far as we know.</v>

3199
02:22:23.211 --> 02:22:26.160
<v Speaker 4>And what if you look at the demographics chosen,</v>

3200
02:22:26.170 --> 02:22:27.030
<v Speaker 4>disintegrated,</v>

3201
02:22:27.120 --> 02:22:30.150
<v Speaker 4>it's disintegrated from the lower socioeconomic classes.</v>

3202
02:22:31.800 --> 02:22:35.130
<v Speaker 4>Come up with a reason for why didn't you privilege people would impress</v>

3203
02:22:35.131 --> 02:22:35.710
<v Speaker 4>themselves.</v>

3204
02:22:35.710 --> 02:22:38.130
<v Speaker 4>Then the whole notion that marriage is not oppressive.</v>

3205
02:22:38.131 --> 02:22:40.470
<v Speaker 4>Patriarchal structure is pretty much English proof.</v>

3206
02:22:41.010 --> 02:22:41.730
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

3207
02:22:41.730 --> 02:22:42.331
<v Speaker 4>so we'll say,</v>

3208
02:22:42.331 --> 02:22:42.571
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3209
02:22:42.571 --> 02:22:44.280
<v Speaker 4>waves aren't as important to their husbands,</v>

3210
02:22:44.281 --> 02:22:48.480
<v Speaker 4>but we also say husbands aren't supporting it to the wives as well.</v>

3211
02:22:48.540 --> 02:22:49.590
<v Speaker 4>And Fair enough.</v>

3212
02:22:49.650 --> 02:22:50.111
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

3213
02:22:50.111 --> 02:22:55.111
<v Speaker 4>so what is it that a couple of subordinate to and answers what's symbolized by</v>

3214
02:22:56.611 --> 02:22:57.444
<v Speaker 4>the light?</v>

3215
02:22:57.900 --> 02:23:00.810
<v Speaker 4>And so what that means now there's an old idea.</v>

3216
02:23:01.110 --> 02:23:02.190
<v Speaker 4>It's a very sick boy.</v>

3217
02:23:02.191 --> 02:23:02.480
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

3218
02:23:02.480 --> 02:23:04.920
<v Speaker 4>a weird idea that Christ was androgynous,</v>

3219
02:23:04.921 --> 02:23:06.600
<v Speaker 4>a combination of male and female.</v>

3220
02:23:06.601 --> 02:23:10.900
<v Speaker 4>He was a reconstruction of the original Adam who is male and female before he</v>

3221
02:23:10.901 --> 02:23:11.820
<v Speaker 4>was pulled apart.</v>

3222
02:23:11.880 --> 02:23:12.900
<v Speaker 4>This is a dream,</v>

3223
02:23:12.901 --> 02:23:13.140
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3224
02:23:13.140 --> 02:23:14.190
<v Speaker 4>It's a cultural Greek.</v>

3225
02:23:14.191 --> 02:23:18.060
<v Speaker 4>And so praise is the property union of masculine and feminine.</v>

3226
02:23:18.720 --> 02:23:20.180
<v Speaker 4>And so that's where the marriage is.</v>

3227
02:23:20.270 --> 02:23:24.150
<v Speaker 4>The property can be that masculine and feminine and the people in the marriage,</v>

3228
02:23:24.180 --> 02:23:27.930
<v Speaker 4>the husband and the wife are supposed to be subordinate to the ideal union of</v>

3229
02:23:27.931 --> 02:23:29.160
<v Speaker 4>masculine and feminine.</v>

3230
02:23:29.640 --> 02:23:31.500
<v Speaker 4>And what that idea of union is,</v>

3231
02:23:31.530 --> 02:23:36.000
<v Speaker 4>that spirit that's created by proper and truthful the baby dialogue.</v>

3232
02:23:36.420 --> 02:23:37.111
<v Speaker 4>So what you do,</v>

3233
02:23:37.111 --> 02:23:37.521
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>

3234
02:23:37.521 --> 02:23:38.550
<v Speaker 4>if you're married to someone,</v>

3235
02:23:39.380 --> 02:23:40.380
<v Speaker 4>you have to contend with,</v>

3236
02:23:40.381 --> 02:23:40.760
<v Speaker 4>everything,</v>

3237
02:23:40.760 --> 02:23:41.820
<v Speaker 4>have to contend with a few.</v>

3238
02:23:41.821 --> 02:23:44.130
<v Speaker 4>And that's a real bad if you're actually communicated,</v>

3239
02:23:44.131 --> 02:23:46.980
<v Speaker 4>cause you're not saying that different personalities,</v>

3240
02:23:46.981 --> 02:23:48.000
<v Speaker 4>you have different values,</v>

3241
02:23:48.001 --> 02:23:48.930
<v Speaker 4>you have different aims,</v>

3242
02:23:49.130 --> 02:23:51.540
<v Speaker 4>are different sections like you're different.</v>

3243
02:23:51.960 --> 02:23:56.340
<v Speaker 4>And that if you could incorporate that difference of both of you can incorporate</v>

3244
02:23:56.341 --> 02:24:00.600
<v Speaker 4>that every time you both why went out and you're full of flaws and your</v>

3245
02:24:00.601 --> 02:24:01.650
<v Speaker 4>partner's full of flaws,</v>

3246
02:24:01.651 --> 02:24:04.260
<v Speaker 4>but he knows something you don't and you know something he does.</v>

3247
02:24:04.380 --> 02:24:06.900
<v Speaker 4>And so as you can start that information exchanged,</v>

3248
02:24:06.901 --> 02:24:09.030
<v Speaker 4>going that peripheral dialogue,</v>

3249
02:24:09.240 --> 02:24:13.620
<v Speaker 4>then both of you can be transformed me in the course of the August speech that</v>

3250
02:24:13.621 --> 02:24:15.060
<v Speaker 4>constitutes the relationship,</v>

3251
02:24:15.330 --> 02:24:18.180
<v Speaker 4>that negotiation and what you're supposed to do.</v>

3252
02:24:18.180 --> 02:24:21.870
<v Speaker 4>And this is what symbolized by the candle is both subordinate yourself to that</v>

3253
02:24:21.871 --> 02:24:23.250
<v Speaker 4>ongoing negotiation.</v>

3254
02:24:23.730 --> 02:24:24.271
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

3255
02:24:24.271 --> 02:24:27.040
<v Speaker 4>one thing you don't want to do is don't want to beat your wasting,</v>

3256
02:24:27.870 --> 02:24:29.000
<v Speaker 4>even though you already want to.</v>

3257
02:24:29.270 --> 02:24:29.481
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3258
02:24:29.481 --> 02:24:30.720
<v Speaker 4>you absolutely want to,</v>

3259
02:24:30.721 --> 02:24:31.870
<v Speaker 4>and you're going to act that out too.</v>

3260
02:24:31.871 --> 02:24:33.600
<v Speaker 4>And she's going to do the same thing to you.</v>

3261
02:24:33.630 --> 02:24:37.590
<v Speaker 4>It's just not that helpful because you have to live with her tomorrow.</v>

3262
02:24:37.760 --> 02:24:40.290
<v Speaker 4>And so if you'll give the hearing an argument,</v>

3263
02:24:40.470 --> 02:24:40.591
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3264
02:24:40.591 --> 02:24:41.510
<v Speaker 4>here's the options.</v>

3265
02:24:41.580 --> 02:24:42.001
<v Speaker 4>A,</v>

3266
02:24:42.001 --> 02:24:43.380
<v Speaker 4>she was writing and you were wrong.</v>

3267
02:24:43.381 --> 02:24:44.490
<v Speaker 4>If you just argument better,</v>

3268
02:24:44.491 --> 02:24:47.850
<v Speaker 4>and so what the hell good is that she's right.</v>

3269
02:24:47.900 --> 02:24:51.660
<v Speaker 4>You have them solve a problem or you would write and you need your good.</v>

3270
02:24:51.930 --> 02:24:54.840
<v Speaker 4>Then she's like in and not very happy about it.</v>

3271
02:24:54.841 --> 02:24:56.580
<v Speaker 4>Who's gonna do the same thing to you?</v>

3272
02:24:56.581 --> 02:24:58.350
<v Speaker 4>As soon as the opportunity arises,</v>

3273
02:24:58.620 --> 02:25:00.300
<v Speaker 4>that's not very helpful.</v>

3274
02:25:00.390 --> 02:25:01.380
<v Speaker 4>So what do you want to do?</v>

3275
02:25:01.381 --> 02:25:03.450
<v Speaker 4>And you want to find out what the hell the problem is,</v>

3276
02:25:03.451 --> 02:25:06.990
<v Speaker 4>which is really painful and horrible thing to do because people sometimes don't</v>

3277
02:25:06.991 --> 02:25:08.250
<v Speaker 4>even know what the coffee is.</v>

3278
02:25:08.251 --> 02:25:12.030
<v Speaker 4>And then you have to listen to them like for three days while they play a lot</v>

3279
02:25:12.040 --> 02:25:16.230
<v Speaker 4>with trying to tell you what's wrong cause they know no and you have to shut up</v>

3280
02:25:16.231 --> 02:25:20.140
<v Speaker 4>and not offer solutions too early because otherwise they can go through the</v>

3281
02:25:20.141 --> 02:25:22.440
<v Speaker 4>painful process of figuring out what the problem is.</v>

3282
02:25:22.770 --> 02:25:27.770
<v Speaker 4>Maybe some problem they have with the of 1975 and it takes to get to the bottom</v>

3283
02:25:30.640 --> 02:25:31.473
<v Speaker 4>of that.</v>

3284
02:25:31.550 --> 02:25:32.050
<v Speaker 4>But if you're,</v>

3285
02:25:32.050 --> 02:25:32.883
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

3286
02:25:34.110 --> 02:25:34.950
<v Speaker 4>if you listen,</v>

3287
02:25:34.960 --> 02:25:37.440
<v Speaker 4>knowing that if you solve the problem,</v>

3288
02:25:37.460 --> 02:25:39.220
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to have any again,</v>

3289
02:25:40.230 --> 02:25:43.450
<v Speaker 4>then you can get that negotiated dialogue going continually.</v>

3290
02:25:43.451 --> 02:25:45.730
<v Speaker 4>And that's what you're supposed to be subordinate to.</v>

3291
02:25:46.180 --> 02:25:48.010
<v Speaker 4>And so then to answer this question,</v>

3292
02:25:48.340 --> 02:25:50.510
<v Speaker 4>which is get back to appearance,</v>

3293
02:25:54.190 --> 02:25:58.180
<v Speaker 4>my wife and I are spending the summer in 25th one group advice on telling sick</v>

3294
02:25:58.200 --> 02:25:58.720
<v Speaker 4>childcare,</v>

3295
02:25:58.720 --> 02:25:59.620
<v Speaker 4>marriage and business.</v>

3296
02:25:59.621 --> 02:25:59.981
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3297
02:25:59.981 --> 02:26:02.080
<v Speaker 4>well my advice is</v>

3298
02:26:04.990 --> 02:26:06.610
<v Speaker 4>stick to your damn cow.</v>

3299
02:26:06.980 --> 02:26:11.980
<v Speaker 4>So you can't run away and then continue with your wife because the two of you</v>

3300
02:26:12.280 --> 02:26:16.630
<v Speaker 4>have you do brings rather than one who probably be able to figure out how to do</v>

3301
02:26:16.690 --> 02:26:17.620
<v Speaker 4>this as you go.</v>

3302
02:26:17.650 --> 02:26:19.330
<v Speaker 4>If you actually talk to each other.</v>

3303
02:26:19.750 --> 02:26:24.750
<v Speaker 4>That's part of the utility of free speech that you give to think out loud and if</v>

3304
02:26:24.971 --> 02:26:29.480
<v Speaker 4>there's someone else around you is also thinking and whose life is intertwined</v>

3305
02:26:29.530 --> 02:26:32.050
<v Speaker 4>with yours and you both Amy from what's good,</v>

3306
02:26:32.380 --> 02:26:35.440
<v Speaker 4>then between the you might be able to get the process going.</v>

3307
02:26:35.441 --> 02:26:36.210
<v Speaker 4>That's the,</v>

3308
02:26:36.210 --> 02:26:38.290
<v Speaker 4>that's the exchange of the logos,</v>

3309
02:26:38.291 --> 02:26:39.040
<v Speaker 4>let's say.</v>

3310
02:26:39.040 --> 02:26:43.390
<v Speaker 4>That will enable you to overcome the problems of life and then maybe have you</v>

3311
02:26:43.391 --> 02:26:43.900
<v Speaker 4>done that.</v>

3312
02:26:43.900 --> 02:26:46.010
<v Speaker 4>You'll make yourself into a unit,</v>

3313
02:26:46.020 --> 02:26:47.650
<v Speaker 4>a reasonably intelligent,</v>

3314
02:26:47.780 --> 02:26:48.480
<v Speaker 4>wise.</v>

3315
02:26:48.480 --> 02:26:49.990
<v Speaker 4>It's also capable of learning.</v>

3316
02:26:50.230 --> 02:26:53.230
<v Speaker 4>And then when your child encounters that unit,</v>

3317
02:26:53.680 --> 02:26:55.300
<v Speaker 4>there'll be a nice wall around them.</v>

3318
02:26:55.350 --> 02:26:55.810
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3319
02:26:55.810 --> 02:26:56.231
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

3320
02:26:56.231 --> 02:26:57.320
<v Speaker 4>Kids are like this.</v>

3321
02:26:57.660 --> 02:26:58.120
<v Speaker 4>They're,</v>

3322
02:26:58.120 --> 02:26:58.510
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

3323
02:26:58.510 --> 02:27:01.570
<v Speaker 4>they're pushy little prime next and they'll do everything they can to find a</v>

3324
02:27:01.571 --> 02:27:02.680
<v Speaker 4>hole in the wall.</v>

3325
02:27:02.740 --> 02:27:03.970
<v Speaker 4>They'll just purchase the torture.</v>

3326
02:27:04.010 --> 02:27:04.491
<v Speaker 4>With George,</v>

3327
02:27:04.491 --> 02:27:07.210
<v Speaker 4>he sees me as a weakness somewhere they want to know.</v>

3328
02:27:07.510 --> 02:27:09.490
<v Speaker 4>And if they can set you against your wife,</v>

3329
02:27:09.520 --> 02:27:10.940
<v Speaker 4>they will absolutely do that.</v>

3330
02:27:11.350 --> 02:27:11.980
<v Speaker 4>But if you,</v>

3331
02:27:11.980 --> 02:27:13.090
<v Speaker 4>because why wouldn't they?</v>

3332
02:27:13.091 --> 02:27:14.650
<v Speaker 4>Because they want to see what's real.</v>

3333
02:27:14.830 --> 02:27:17.380
<v Speaker 4>They're not messing around or trying to live right.</v>

3334
02:27:17.381 --> 02:27:19.960
<v Speaker 4>And they want to see what's real and then they're going to push the boundaries.</v>

3335
02:27:20.560 --> 02:27:25.000
<v Speaker 4>And if you have a solid relationship and the kid comes up and pushes against</v>

3336
02:27:25.001 --> 02:27:25.151
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

3337
02:27:25.151 --> 02:27:25.930
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

3338
02:27:25.930 --> 02:27:26.110
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3339
02:27:26.110 --> 02:27:26.890
<v Speaker 4>how could you talk?</v>

3340
02:27:26.890 --> 02:27:28.640
<v Speaker 4>Or we're going to walk once or twice.</v>

3341
02:27:28.641 --> 02:27:30.100
<v Speaker 4>So stand up underneath a table.</v>

3342
02:27:30.140 --> 02:27:32.620
<v Speaker 4>It's too short and snappy is had a good one.</v>

3343
02:27:32.860 --> 02:27:36.370
<v Speaker 4>But because of the table never changes shape.</v>

3344
02:27:37.090 --> 02:27:38.570
<v Speaker 4>He'll only do that once.</v>

3345
02:27:39.370 --> 02:27:40.850
<v Speaker 4>And so now if we change,</v>

3346
02:27:41.270 --> 02:27:44.770
<v Speaker 4>he was changing shape all the time where the kid would be underneath there</v>

3347
02:27:44.771 --> 02:27:46.880
<v Speaker 4>trying to bang his head on it nonstop.</v>

3348
02:27:46.990 --> 02:27:51.990
<v Speaker 4>So if you and your wife has forged a unit that that isn't editable in some</v>

3349
02:27:52.241 --> 02:27:53.074
<v Speaker 4>sense,</v>

3350
02:27:53.200 --> 02:27:56.880
<v Speaker 4>then they're going to push and push until they find out that that doesn't work.</v>

3351
02:27:56.950 --> 02:27:58.750
<v Speaker 4>And to play that game anymore.</v>

3352
02:27:59.230 --> 02:28:02.110
<v Speaker 4>And that's going to be really good for you because then your children will</v>

3353
02:28:02.170 --> 02:28:05.320
<v Speaker 4>tortured to death and it's really going to be good for your child because</v>

3354
02:28:05.330 --> 02:28:09.850
<v Speaker 4>they're going to have tested the limits and find out that there are walls to</v>

3355
02:28:09.851 --> 02:28:13.690
<v Speaker 4>keep the chaos out and that's going to make me feel secure and then they're</v>

3356
02:28:13.691 --> 02:28:16.240
<v Speaker 4>going to be able to develop within that security.</v>

3357
02:28:16.570 --> 02:28:18.160
<v Speaker 4>So that's a perfect deal.</v>

3358
02:28:18.400 --> 02:28:22.620
<v Speaker 4>And so that's fine advice or you was happy summer</v>

3359
02:28:24.160 --> 02:28:29.160
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

3360
02:28:36.260 --> 02:28:40.310
<v Speaker 4>how should I structure my future children's education fully prepared for</v>

3361
02:28:40.680 --> 02:28:44.040
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] and respect their culture?</v>

3362
02:28:45.180 --> 02:28:45.391
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3363
02:28:45.391 --> 02:28:47.340
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that you might want to think through,</v>

3364
02:28:47.490 --> 02:28:48.480
<v Speaker 4>I have a chapter</v>

3365
02:28:50.250 --> 02:28:52.890
<v Speaker 4>that children do anything that makes you dislike them.</v>

3366
02:28:53.180 --> 02:28:55.530
<v Speaker 4>And I thought about lecturing about that tonight too.</v>

3367
02:28:55.650 --> 02:28:58.140
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of a dark chapter as well.</v>

3368
02:28:58.650 --> 02:29:00.650
<v Speaker 4>I guess maybe the whole book is like that</v>

3369
02:29:03.980 --> 02:29:04.510
<v Speaker 4>locally.</v>

3370
02:29:04.510 --> 02:29:06.630
<v Speaker 4>The more you're able to confront the darkness,</v>

3371
02:29:06.631 --> 02:29:10.950
<v Speaker 4>the more people are likely to assume that you have something to say.</v>

3372
02:29:11.180 --> 02:29:13.530
<v Speaker 4>I would say because it's,</v>

3373
02:29:13.980 --> 02:29:18.880
<v Speaker 4>you have every reason to shy away from the dark every reason and so,</v>

3374
02:29:19.480 --> 02:29:21.660
<v Speaker 4>and everyone knows how dark life can be.</v>

3375
02:29:21.750 --> 02:29:24.570
<v Speaker 4>And so if you pretended that it sounds like that,</v>

3376
02:29:24.690 --> 02:29:26.790
<v Speaker 4>then why should anyone listen to you?</v>

3377
02:29:27.120 --> 02:29:27.301
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3378
02:29:27.301 --> 02:29:28.320
<v Speaker 4>I know what life was like.</v>

3379
02:29:28.321 --> 02:29:31.110
<v Speaker 4>I've spent $20,000 counseling people through.</v>

3380
02:29:31.290 --> 02:29:35.730
<v Speaker 4>The most difficult thing is sometimes that were so difficult that I couldn't</v>

3381
02:29:35.731 --> 02:29:36.564
<v Speaker 4>help.</v>

3382
02:29:36.680 --> 02:29:37.550
<v Speaker 4>I know they would just,</v>

3383
02:29:37.880 --> 02:29:38.580
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't,</v>

3384
02:29:38.580 --> 02:29:40.680
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't help them solve a problem,</v>

3385
02:29:40.830 --> 02:29:42.920
<v Speaker 4>even with the best of willow in their apartment.</v>

3386
02:29:43.380 --> 02:29:44.340
<v Speaker 4>And we're just cornered.</v>

3387
02:29:44.341 --> 02:29:45.520
<v Speaker 4>And there was no damn way out.</v>

3388
02:29:45.590 --> 02:29:46.381
<v Speaker 4>It was very,</v>

3389
02:29:46.381 --> 02:29:47.214
<v Speaker 4>very bad.</v>

3390
02:29:47.520 --> 02:29:52.320
<v Speaker 4>But most of the time it was a very positive experience because very frequently</v>

3391
02:29:52.321 --> 02:29:53.100
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

3392
02:29:53.100 --> 02:29:55.120
<v Speaker 4>even in dire straits can make advice along.</v>

3393
02:29:56.480 --> 02:29:57.313
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

3394
02:29:57.320 --> 02:29:58.200
<v Speaker 4>but to do that,</v>

3395
02:29:58.230 --> 02:29:58.411
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3396
02:29:58.411 --> 02:30:01.530
<v Speaker 4>you have to have to confront what's terrible about life.</v>

3397
02:30:02.130 --> 02:30:04.890
<v Speaker 4>Life is tragic events by level.</v>

3398
02:30:06.020 --> 02:30:07.860
<v Speaker 4>And so you have to be able to deal with that.</v>

3399
02:30:08.130 --> 02:30:08.963
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

3400
02:30:10.640 --> 02:30:11.580
<v Speaker 4>how's your destruction?</v>

3401
02:30:11.660 --> 02:30:13.080
<v Speaker 4>What would your children's education?</v>

3402
02:30:13.081 --> 02:30:13.410
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3403
02:30:13.410 --> 02:30:18.120
<v Speaker 4>the first thing that'll EMC back into little five hour look,</v>

3404
02:30:19.440 --> 02:30:22.360
<v Speaker 4>the reason you don't want to let the children do anything that makes you dislike</v>

3405
02:30:22.361 --> 02:30:23.610
<v Speaker 4>or just because you'll be needing,</v>

3406
02:30:23.611 --> 02:30:27.450
<v Speaker 4>if you don't like that and you're way bigger than them and you're really capable</v>

3407
02:30:27.451 --> 02:30:31.230
<v Speaker 4>of being needy and you might be mean because it's like you're the sort of person</v>

3408
02:30:31.231 --> 02:30:34.280
<v Speaker 4>who abuses your child physically lash out.</v>

3409
02:30:34.290 --> 02:30:38.190
<v Speaker 4>You have a terrible temper and your Anglian Emily May succeeded her brutal or</v>

3410
02:30:38.191 --> 02:30:43.020
<v Speaker 4>you might get a sort of person that smothers dependent law and either way you</v>

3411
02:30:43.021 --> 02:30:47.250
<v Speaker 4>can just do that again and you can do both of those unbelievably mean and if you</v>

3412
02:30:47.251 --> 02:30:48.180
<v Speaker 4>don't make the children,</v>

3413
02:30:48.300 --> 02:30:51.120
<v Speaker 4>that is exactly what you do and you might take off.</v>

3414
02:30:51.121 --> 02:30:51.331
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3415
02:30:51.331 --> 02:30:52.430
<v Speaker 4>you won't get he loved all.</v>

3416
02:30:52.431 --> 02:30:52.740
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3417
02:30:52.740 --> 02:30:53.760
<v Speaker 4>yes it will happen.</v>

3418
02:30:54.090 --> 02:30:55.140
<v Speaker 4>That's when people are like,</v>

3419
02:30:55.170 --> 02:30:59.190
<v Speaker 4>and that's why families are often such snake heads of catastrophe and they don't</v>

3420
02:30:59.191 --> 02:31:03.740
<v Speaker 4>have to be like a frequently are and lots of people's whole life turning his</v>

3421
02:31:03.780 --> 02:31:07.080
<v Speaker 4>fight their way home to unbelievably pathological family.</v>

3422
02:31:07.350 --> 02:31:08.920
<v Speaker 4>That's the whole Freud in nightmare.</v>

3423
02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:09.833
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure.</v>

3424
02:31:10.140 --> 02:31:10.973
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

3425
02:31:12.420 --> 02:31:15.960
<v Speaker 4>you want to encourage your children to behave in a manner that makes you deeply</v>

3426
02:31:15.961 --> 02:31:17.700
<v Speaker 4>appreciate the fact that they exist.</v>

3427
02:31:17.760 --> 02:31:18.780
<v Speaker 4>Now you're kind of,</v>

3428
02:31:19.710 --> 02:31:22.950
<v Speaker 4>because you're only one person and so hopefully you have someone around you that</v>

3429
02:31:22.980 --> 02:31:24.060
<v Speaker 4>your longterm partner,</v>

3430
02:31:24.061 --> 02:31:24.690
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

3431
02:31:24.690 --> 02:31:28.110
<v Speaker 4>who can slap it on the back of the head when you're being too insane.</v>

3432
02:31:28.230 --> 02:31:29.670
<v Speaker 4>Because you know,</v>

3433
02:31:29.760 --> 02:31:32.310
<v Speaker 4>part of what might make you dislike your children's,</v>

3434
02:31:32.311 --> 02:31:35.160
<v Speaker 4>the fact that you just don't have your act together very well and they're doing</v>

3435
02:31:35.161 --> 02:31:37.590
<v Speaker 4>perfectly okay things if you happen to be irritated.</v>

3436
02:31:38.370 --> 02:31:41.820
<v Speaker 4>And so that's partly why you need a partner can sort of alerted to when you're</v>

3437
02:31:41.821 --> 02:31:43.490
<v Speaker 4>being unreasonable about your demand.</v>

3438
02:31:43.620 --> 02:31:45.420
<v Speaker 4>And hopefully the two of you were different enough.</v>

3439
02:31:45.421 --> 02:31:46.680
<v Speaker 4>So you're in Melville,</v>

3440
02:31:47.030 --> 02:31:51.290
<v Speaker 4>one to half decent sequent together person and that person helped you.</v>

3441
02:31:51.500 --> 02:31:53.430
<v Speaker 4>Did y'all learn how to be likable?</v>

3442
02:31:53.431 --> 02:31:54.620
<v Speaker 4>So other people like them.</v>

3443
02:31:54.900 --> 02:31:56.610
<v Speaker 4>So the first thing you want to say grout,</v>

3444
02:31:56.670 --> 02:32:00.860
<v Speaker 4>if you want your child to have a proper relationship with Ba,</v>

3445
02:32:00.861 --> 02:32:03.450
<v Speaker 4>etc. Is whether that's actually what you want.</v>

3446
02:32:04.540 --> 02:32:05.070
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3447
02:32:05.070 --> 02:32:05.910
<v Speaker 4>because you might be able to,</v>

3448
02:32:05.911 --> 02:32:06.211
<v Speaker 4>of course,</v>

3449
02:32:06.211 --> 02:32:07.710
<v Speaker 4>that's what people want for the children.</v>

3450
02:32:07.711 --> 02:32:08.011
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3451
02:32:08.011 --> 02:32:08.611
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3452
02:32:08.611 --> 02:32:09.930
<v Speaker 4>not of course.</v>

3453
02:32:10.020 --> 02:32:11.190
<v Speaker 4>And it's not what we have.</v>

3454
02:32:11.490 --> 02:32:16.300
<v Speaker 4>Lots of people have terrible parents and they're not just fair to neglect mean</v>

3455
02:32:16.350 --> 02:32:17.071
<v Speaker 4>that's bad,</v>

3456
02:32:17.071 --> 02:32:17.820
<v Speaker 4>but it's not.</v>

3457
02:32:17.820 --> 02:32:20.430
<v Speaker 4>That's only where that starts at neglect.</v>

3458
02:32:20.560 --> 02:32:21.740
<v Speaker 4>The kids can handle that.</v>

3459
02:32:21.741 --> 02:32:22.141
<v Speaker 4>It's movies,</v>

3460
02:32:22.141 --> 02:32:23.220
<v Speaker 4>it's not total.</v>

3461
02:32:23.370 --> 02:32:25.890
<v Speaker 4>But like I've had clients whose parents did.</v>

3462
02:32:26.070 --> 02:32:28.530
<v Speaker 4>Every time that person did something good,</v>

3463
02:32:28.531 --> 02:32:32.550
<v Speaker 4>their parents punished every single time until they were terrified of doing</v>

3464
02:32:32.551 --> 02:32:33.540
<v Speaker 4>anything at all.</v>

3465
02:32:33.570 --> 02:32:35.890
<v Speaker 4>And even punish them by criticizing them to death.</v>

3466
02:32:35.920 --> 02:32:40.920
<v Speaker 4>And they had the goal to try to do something useful in the world or acting as if</v>

3467
02:32:41.820 --> 02:32:45.900
<v Speaker 4>they were absolutely terrified and stole every type of child took a risk,</v>

3468
02:32:46.140 --> 02:32:49.480
<v Speaker 4>which is the sort of helicopter parenting that so absolutely catastrophic,</v>

3469
02:32:49.640 --> 02:32:51.360
<v Speaker 4>but don't upset your mother,</v>

3470
02:32:51.620 --> 02:32:52.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3471
02:32:52.140 --> 02:32:55.350
<v Speaker 4>with your courageous and forthright action in the world.</v>

3472
02:32:55.650 --> 02:32:55.921
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3473
02:32:55.921 --> 02:32:59.850
<v Speaker 4>And so then see if you knew that they can associate courageous auction with</v>

3474
02:32:59.851 --> 02:33:00.684
<v Speaker 4>guilt.</v>

3475
02:33:00.810 --> 02:33:02.590
<v Speaker 4>If you really want to give it to your kids and have not,</v>

3476
02:33:02.591 --> 02:33:03.600
<v Speaker 4>it's an excellent trick.</v>

3477
02:33:03.600 --> 02:33:06.870
<v Speaker 4>You take the best thing about them and make it feel horrible about it,</v>

3478
02:33:07.230 --> 02:33:08.250
<v Speaker 4>that's a good trick.</v>

3479
02:33:08.490 --> 02:33:10.140
<v Speaker 4>And if you don't take your capable of that,</v>

3480
02:33:10.141 --> 02:33:12.390
<v Speaker 4>then you're not taking it because you aren't capable of it.</v>

3481
02:33:12.630 --> 02:33:13.710
<v Speaker 4>And to real danger.</v>

3482
02:33:13.920 --> 02:33:15.410
<v Speaker 4>It's the danger of over protected,</v>

3483
02:33:15.411 --> 02:33:17.810
<v Speaker 4>which cause it takes a real courageous parent too.</v>

3484
02:33:18.470 --> 02:33:19.350
<v Speaker 4>It's so interesting.</v>

3485
02:33:19.351 --> 02:33:20.580
<v Speaker 4>I watched this video last night,</v>

3486
02:33:20.600 --> 02:33:21.221
<v Speaker 4>my wife should be,</v>

3487
02:33:21.221 --> 02:33:22.054
<v Speaker 4>to me,</v>

3488
02:33:22.110 --> 02:33:23.190
<v Speaker 4>I think it was from Russia.</v>

3489
02:33:23.340 --> 02:33:26.280
<v Speaker 4>I don't think this could have ever possibly happen with North America.</v>

3490
02:33:27.300 --> 02:33:28.890
<v Speaker 4>This kid was about to,</v>

3491
02:33:28.950 --> 02:33:30.240
<v Speaker 4>I think still in diapers,</v>

3492
02:33:30.480 --> 02:33:31.710
<v Speaker 4>pretty mobile.</v>

3493
02:33:32.260 --> 02:33:36.450
<v Speaker 4>And the in parents that put up when those little doorways that you put up for</v>

3494
02:33:36.451 --> 02:33:41.010
<v Speaker 4>kids in the door that keeps them in the room or maybe stops falling down the</v>

3495
02:33:41.011 --> 02:33:41.844
<v Speaker 4>stairs.</v>

3496
02:33:41.850 --> 02:33:44.850
<v Speaker 4>And so had one of those little things that were in the doorway.</v>

3497
02:33:45.090 --> 02:33:48.870
<v Speaker 4>There was actually two of them on top of each other because this kid have</v>

3498
02:33:48.871 --> 02:33:52.020
<v Speaker 4>learned how to climb up the attic,</v>

3499
02:33:52.100 --> 02:33:55.800
<v Speaker 4>like to and learned how to quiet the little,</v>

3500
02:33:56.580 --> 02:34:00.750
<v Speaker 4>the little door with them as opposed to another one on top.</v>

3501
02:34:00.751 --> 02:34:02.130
<v Speaker 4>And he climbed up that up too.</v>

3502
02:34:02.240 --> 02:34:06.180
<v Speaker 4>But he's having a hell of a fine time falling over the top and he was in</v>

3503
02:34:06.181 --> 02:34:06.691
<v Speaker 4>diapers.</v>

3504
02:34:06.691 --> 02:34:07.270
<v Speaker 4>And look at that.</v>

3505
02:34:07.270 --> 02:34:11.300
<v Speaker 4>You think that because of what's been happening,</v>

3506
02:34:11.430 --> 02:34:13.470
<v Speaker 4>but the parents didn't interfere.</v>

3507
02:34:13.560 --> 02:34:14.710
<v Speaker 4>They videotaped it.</v>

3508
02:34:16.950 --> 02:34:17.410
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3509
02:34:17.410 --> 02:34:17.681
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3510
02:34:17.681 --> 02:34:19.720
<v Speaker 4>it's not what's abusive.</v>

3511
02:34:19.750 --> 02:34:21.510
<v Speaker 4>Here's what's abusers is you.</v>

3512
02:34:21.511 --> 02:34:22.211
<v Speaker 4>When you come to kid,</v>

3513
02:34:22.211 --> 02:34:23.630
<v Speaker 4>he's three quarters of the way up.</v>

3514
02:34:23.690 --> 02:34:24.640
<v Speaker 4>The second one,</v>

3515
02:34:24.760 --> 02:34:28.570
<v Speaker 4>so like five feet off the ground and then you have a little panic attack about</v>

3516
02:34:28.571 --> 02:34:29.590
<v Speaker 4>how dangerous it is.</v>

3517
02:34:29.770 --> 02:34:31.480
<v Speaker 4>So then you went to Sanford child,</v>

3518
02:34:31.510 --> 02:34:35.890
<v Speaker 4>so that all and hurts himself and then you'd tell them that's what happens when</v>

3519
02:34:35.891 --> 02:34:36.910
<v Speaker 4>you do that sort of thing.</v>

3520
02:34:37.530 --> 02:34:40.330
<v Speaker 4>That's a user and they didn't do them.</v>

3521
02:34:40.690 --> 02:34:45.690
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] masquerade and he's like,</v>

3522
02:34:50.110 --> 02:34:52.020
<v Speaker 4>it's a courageous parent who stands doc.</v>

3523
02:34:52.021 --> 02:34:52.810
<v Speaker 4>And I think so,</v>

3524
02:34:52.810 --> 02:34:53.643
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3525
02:34:53.740 --> 02:34:55.000
<v Speaker 4>I don't want that kid to fall,</v>

3526
02:34:55.001 --> 02:34:56.800
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not getting a fuck about these zones.</v>

3527
02:34:56.810 --> 02:34:58.630
<v Speaker 4>They're like master new world.</v>

3528
02:34:58.750 --> 02:35:00.400
<v Speaker 4>So naturally to do,</v>

3529
02:35:00.401 --> 02:35:03.640
<v Speaker 4>if you have some courage and you let your children take your lumps,</v>

3530
02:35:03.900 --> 02:35:04.990
<v Speaker 4>if you don't have lumps,</v>

3531
02:35:04.991 --> 02:35:06.520
<v Speaker 4>are going to get blocked beginning.</v>

3532
02:35:07.020 --> 02:35:07.853
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

3533
02:35:09.950 --> 02:35:12.340
<v Speaker 4>so you decide you want the best for your children.</v>

3534
02:35:12.880 --> 02:35:16.150
<v Speaker 4>And you've got to ask yourself that question seriously because there's at least,</v>

3535
02:35:16.210 --> 02:35:17.920
<v Speaker 4>there's a big part of that Katie part,</v>

3536
02:35:17.930 --> 02:35:20.500
<v Speaker 4>let's say it does not appoint the business with your children.</v>

3537
02:35:20.870 --> 02:35:22.960
<v Speaker 4>That would be annoyed if they were successful.</v>

3538
02:35:23.290 --> 02:35:24.560
<v Speaker 4>It would be unhappy with me.</v>

3539
02:35:24.561 --> 02:35:26.360
<v Speaker 4>Succeed and so,</v>

3540
02:35:26.410 --> 02:35:30.220
<v Speaker 4>and if you don't think that's true that you do not know anything before because</v>

3541
02:35:30.221 --> 02:35:33.070
<v Speaker 4>it is true and PB had everyone's like that.</v>

3542
02:35:33.071 --> 02:35:35.170
<v Speaker 4>Some people are really like that.</v>

3543
02:35:35.740 --> 02:35:37.160
<v Speaker 4>So when you mentioned cubs dark,</v>

3544
02:35:37.840 --> 02:35:38.673
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't matter.</v>

3545
02:35:38.680 --> 02:35:40.110
<v Speaker 4>It's real easy to start</v>

3546
02:35:41.920 --> 02:35:46.920
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible].</v>

3547
02:35:49.960 --> 02:35:54.210
<v Speaker 4>What would you say to someone who doesn't feel like enough while you're right,</v>

3548
02:35:55.500 --> 02:35:56.333
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

3549
02:35:56.880 --> 02:35:57.940
<v Speaker 4>That's okay.</v>

3550
02:35:58.330 --> 02:36:01.030
<v Speaker 4>What you should do is beat yourself up because of that.</v>

3551
02:36:01.600 --> 02:36:03.640
<v Speaker 4>Like you're not enough and you shouldn't.</v>

3552
02:36:03.730 --> 02:36:04.650
<v Speaker 4>You shouldn't think you are.</v>

3553
02:36:04.680 --> 02:36:05.051
<v Speaker 4>You can think,</v>

3554
02:36:05.051 --> 02:36:05.884
<v Speaker 4>what the hell are you?</v>

3555
02:36:06.130 --> 02:36:06.790
<v Speaker 4>Are you going to you?</v>

3556
02:36:06.790 --> 02:36:08.430
<v Speaker 4>If you're already a candy bowl,</v>

3557
02:36:08.431 --> 02:36:09.480
<v Speaker 4>you have nothing to do.</v>

3558
02:36:09.820 --> 02:36:10.180
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3559
02:36:10.180 --> 02:36:14.890
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that I noticed it talking to audiences like this over the last</v>

3560
02:36:14.890 --> 02:36:15.670
<v Speaker 4>year and a half,</v>

3561
02:36:15.670 --> 02:36:17.080
<v Speaker 4>the audience is very quiet.</v>

3562
02:36:17.140 --> 02:36:18.610
<v Speaker 4>When I talk about two things.</v>

3563
02:36:19.390 --> 02:36:21.770
<v Speaker 4>One is responsibility and Ruben,</v>

3564
02:36:21.780 --> 02:36:22.613
<v Speaker 4>who's quiet.</v>

3565
02:36:22.660 --> 02:36:23.680
<v Speaker 4>That's so cool.</v>

3566
02:36:23.710 --> 02:36:24.390
<v Speaker 4>Cause Grips,</v>

3567
02:36:24.390 --> 02:36:26.560
<v Speaker 4>PE know it's like well there's something to that.</v>

3568
02:36:27.100 --> 02:36:29.310
<v Speaker 4>And you know that in an audience was quiet,</v>

3569
02:36:29.320 --> 02:36:30.220
<v Speaker 4>we were talking comes up,</v>

3570
02:36:30.490 --> 02:36:31.830
<v Speaker 4>you know there's something in the air,</v>

3571
02:36:32.130 --> 02:36:34.030
<v Speaker 4>it's an unspoken necessity,</v>

3572
02:36:34.090 --> 02:36:35.260
<v Speaker 4>it's manifested itself,</v>

3573
02:36:36.550 --> 02:36:37.940
<v Speaker 4>it's that and</v>

3574
02:36:41.360 --> 02:36:43.480
<v Speaker 4>this issue of self esteem.</v>

3575
02:36:44.380 --> 02:36:46.360
<v Speaker 4>So what I'm suggesting to people,</v>

3576
02:36:46.540 --> 02:36:47.550
<v Speaker 4>psychologists,</v>

3577
02:36:47.680 --> 02:36:51.520
<v Speaker 4>bless her soul that aren't very well informed,</v>

3578
02:36:51.820 --> 02:36:56.820
<v Speaker 4>have been telling people for five decades that he should have high self esteem.</v>

3579
02:36:57.610 --> 02:36:58.120
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3580
02:36:58.120 --> 02:36:58.960
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

3581
02:36:59.470 --> 02:37:03.670
<v Speaker 4>most of what passes for self esteem as mentioned by psychologist is actually a</v>

3582
02:37:03.671 --> 02:37:04.930
<v Speaker 4>temperamental trait.</v>

3583
02:37:05.230 --> 02:37:08.070
<v Speaker 4>So if you take self esteem scales and you score high,</v>

3584
02:37:08.071 --> 02:37:10.450
<v Speaker 4>it's because you're extroverted and low in neuroticism.</v>

3585
02:37:10.600 --> 02:37:12.580
<v Speaker 4>So the scales are wrong.</v>

3586
02:37:12.640 --> 02:37:13.810
<v Speaker 4>So that's one.</v>

3587
02:37:14.050 --> 02:37:17.660
<v Speaker 4>And number two is [inaudible] says you should have high self esteem.</v>

3588
02:37:17.720 --> 02:37:21.180
<v Speaker 4>What's so great about you and you think,</v>

3589
02:37:21.200 --> 02:37:22.880
<v Speaker 4>well that's a terrible thing to tell people.</v>

3590
02:37:22.881 --> 02:37:26.480
<v Speaker 4>It's like going snow on because people aren't very happy with who they are.</v>

3591
02:37:27.190 --> 02:37:28.040
<v Speaker 4>And so if you tell them,</v>

3592
02:37:28.041 --> 02:37:28.371
<v Speaker 4>oh no,</v>

3593
02:37:28.371 --> 02:37:29.540
<v Speaker 4>you're good the way you argued.</v>

3594
02:37:30.020 --> 02:37:30.853
<v Speaker 4>Wait a second,</v>

3595
02:37:31.310 --> 02:37:33.710
<v Speaker 4>I'm not happy with the way things are with me.</v>

3596
02:37:33.980 --> 02:37:36.800
<v Speaker 4>And so I'm supposed to be happy with the way I am.</v>

3597
02:37:36.801 --> 02:37:38.600
<v Speaker 4>Then like what about all this misery?</v>

3598
02:37:38.601 --> 02:37:39.740
<v Speaker 4>That's part of my life.</v>

3599
02:37:40.130 --> 02:37:43.400
<v Speaker 4>And so it's not a good thing to tell people that they're just okay the way they</v>

3600
02:37:43.401 --> 02:37:43.910
<v Speaker 4>are.</v>

3601
02:37:43.910 --> 02:37:45.200
<v Speaker 4>That's not good at all.</v>

3602
02:37:45.700 --> 02:37:49.310
<v Speaker 4>What do you want to tell them is you could be way more than you are.</v>

3603
02:37:50.060 --> 02:37:51.710
<v Speaker 4>You could be way more than you are.</v>

3604
02:37:52.100 --> 02:37:53.110
<v Speaker 4>And that would be that.</v>

3605
02:37:53.170 --> 02:37:56.050
<v Speaker 4>That would be better for you and it would be better for your families,</v>

3606
02:37:56.070 --> 02:37:57.320
<v Speaker 4>would be better for the country,</v>

3607
02:37:57.390 --> 02:37:58.410
<v Speaker 4>be better for everyone.</v>

3608
02:37:58.870 --> 02:38:03.110
<v Speaker 4>And there's something about insufficient and wretchedness war.</v>

3609
02:38:03.170 --> 02:38:04.850
<v Speaker 4>They did start that,</v>

3610
02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:08.060
<v Speaker 4>start on that pathway and be successful at it.</v>

3611
02:38:08.360 --> 02:38:13.360
<v Speaker 4>And so it isn't that you should be that you should be happy with yourself</v>

3612
02:38:14.211 --> 02:38:15.050
<v Speaker 4>because of who you are.</v>

3613
02:38:16.070 --> 02:38:20.720
<v Speaker 4>It's that you should be respectful of yourself because you are the sort of</v>

3614
02:38:20.721 --> 02:38:23.750
<v Speaker 4>person who could transform herself into who you could be.</v>

3615
02:38:24.140 --> 02:38:26.180
<v Speaker 4>And now it's way better.</v>

3616
02:38:26.750 --> 02:38:31.750
<v Speaker 4>And so [inaudible] want to put a little bit boundary rub that,</v>

3617
02:38:36.081 --> 02:38:36.740
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

3618
02:38:36.740 --> 02:38:38.690
<v Speaker 4>I know that people can be themselves often.</v>

3619
02:38:38.720 --> 02:38:39.920
<v Speaker 4>They do that all the time.</v>

3620
02:38:40.010 --> 02:38:44.420
<v Speaker 4>And so you can be too judgmental with regards to yourself.</v>

3621
02:38:44.421 --> 02:38:47.510
<v Speaker 4>And that leads to depression and high levels of anxiety can be really</v>

3622
02:38:47.511 --> 02:38:50.300
<v Speaker 4>destructive and can culminate suicide like you got to,</v>

3623
02:38:50.720 --> 02:38:52.850
<v Speaker 4>despite the fact that you're not everything you could be,</v>

3624
02:38:52.851 --> 02:38:55.640
<v Speaker 4>you have to have a little bit of mercy that you're touch towards yourself.</v>

3625
02:38:55.641 --> 02:38:56.360
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to,</v>

3626
02:38:56.360 --> 02:38:57.170
<v Speaker 4>you don't want it.</v>

3627
02:38:57.170 --> 02:39:00.200
<v Speaker 4>You want to treat yourself with someone that you're trying to help.</v>

3628
02:39:00.860 --> 02:39:01.041
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3629
02:39:01.041 --> 02:39:01.871
<v Speaker 4>That's another rule.</v>

3630
02:39:01.871 --> 02:39:02.980
<v Speaker 4>And you talk to us for life.</v>

3631
02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.590
<v Speaker 4>Treat yourself like you're someone you're responsible for helpful.</v>

3632
02:39:05.720 --> 02:39:07.190
<v Speaker 4>And that would be hard as it bit of detachment.</v>

3633
02:39:07.400 --> 02:39:11.510
<v Speaker 4>Imagine that you're worthwhile despite your anatomy nurses and they've your</v>

3634
02:39:11.511 --> 02:39:15.430
<v Speaker 4>necessary in the world at least as a bulwark against help.</v>

3635
02:39:15.590 --> 02:39:19.460
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's absolutely the case because you could certainly generate a</v>

3636
02:39:19.461 --> 02:39:21.470
<v Speaker 4>little held on yourself without too much effort.</v>

3637
02:39:21.470 --> 02:39:24.880
<v Speaker 4>So you could at least not do that and that might be important.</v>

3638
02:39:25.490 --> 02:39:28.860
<v Speaker 4>So it's reasonable to treat yourself with a certain amount of detached with</v>

3639
02:39:28.870 --> 02:39:31.280
<v Speaker 4>respect and then to regard yourself as,</v>

3640
02:39:31.281 --> 02:39:32.840
<v Speaker 4>so when you should try to help.</v>

3641
02:39:32.910 --> 02:39:36.450
<v Speaker 4>Like you would help someone who can carry forward in a detached sort of way.</v>

3642
02:39:36.451 --> 02:39:38.810
<v Speaker 4>Because if people have value,</v>

3643
02:39:39.080 --> 02:39:43.640
<v Speaker 4>if other people have value that you have value and you open yourself the safe,</v>

3644
02:39:43.641 --> 02:39:47.140
<v Speaker 4>ethical responsibility that you will welcome people and maybe what you will</v>

3645
02:39:47.150 --> 02:39:51.410
<v Speaker 4>other people is the responsibility to help move along the way so that the world</v>

3646
02:39:51.411 --> 02:39:51.890
<v Speaker 4>gets better,</v>

3647
02:39:51.890 --> 02:39:52.820
<v Speaker 4>relevant works.</v>

3648
02:39:52.880 --> 02:39:55.820
<v Speaker 4>And so that's the same attitude that you should make yourself.</v>

3649
02:39:55.821 --> 02:40:00.050
<v Speaker 4>So despite the fact that we are all making showed me and despite the fact that</v>

3650
02:40:00.051 --> 02:40:01.860
<v Speaker 4>you have plenty to allergic and you should learn,</v>

3651
02:40:01.861 --> 02:40:02.990
<v Speaker 4>there you go.</v>

3652
02:40:03.050 --> 02:40:07.220
<v Speaker 4>You also don't get to beat yourself to death with a stick all the time because</v>

3653
02:40:07.221 --> 02:40:09.800
<v Speaker 4>you're insufficient in 15 different ways.</v>

3654
02:40:10.340 --> 02:40:12.290
<v Speaker 4>So justice,</v>

3655
02:40:12.350 --> 02:40:13.183
<v Speaker 4>that's the,</v>

3656
02:40:13.560 --> 02:40:16.230
<v Speaker 4>and mercy is what people seem to tolerate the children.</v>

3657
02:40:16.500 --> 02:40:17.640
<v Speaker 4>And you need to use disposable.</v>

3658
02:40:17.650 --> 02:40:21.660
<v Speaker 4>That was in order to establish the proper relationship with your life.</v>

3659
02:40:22.080 --> 02:40:27.080
<v Speaker 4>And so you're not enough and say going for that cause you wouldn't have anything</v>

3660
02:40:27.150 --> 02:40:31.290
<v Speaker 4>worthwhile to do if you were enough and you do have something worthwhile to do,</v>

3661
02:40:31.291 --> 02:40:34.230
<v Speaker 4>which is to make things better than they are of yourself.</v>

3662
02:40:34.350 --> 02:40:36.870
<v Speaker 4>And so do it.</v>

3663
02:40:37.430 --> 02:40:42.430
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible]</v>

3664
02:41:00.320 --> 02:41:02.100
<v Speaker 4>do you pray?</v>

3665
02:41:05.370 --> 02:41:05.970
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3666
02:41:05.970 --> 02:41:06.803
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

3667
02:41:10.020 --> 02:41:12.140
<v Speaker 4>I don't ask God for famous.</v>

3668
02:41:13.880 --> 02:41:14.190
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3669
02:41:14.190 --> 02:41:15.940
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's what people do,</v>

3670
02:41:15.941 --> 02:41:16.774
<v Speaker 4>that the prayer</v>

3671
02:41:21.140 --> 02:41:23.340
<v Speaker 4>prayer is actually something that works,</v>

3672
02:41:24.450 --> 02:41:27.150
<v Speaker 4>but ask them for favors with God.</v>

3673
02:41:27.151 --> 02:41:29.430
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't work because that is how it works.</v>

3674
02:41:30.160 --> 02:41:34.650
<v Speaker 4>He couldn't ask to have enough courage to see the truth.</v>

3675
02:41:35.940 --> 02:41:37.530
<v Speaker 4>And that's a painful thing to do.</v>

3676
02:41:37.710 --> 02:41:38.521
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>

3677
02:41:38.521 --> 02:41:38.881
<v Speaker 4>here's a,</v>

3678
02:41:38.881 --> 02:41:41.580
<v Speaker 4>here's a prayer of sorts.</v>

3679
02:41:41.880 --> 02:41:43.170
<v Speaker 4>It's imagine you're hugging the site guys,</v>

3680
02:41:43.171 --> 02:41:43.740
<v Speaker 4>your white,</v>

3681
02:41:43.740 --> 02:41:44.760
<v Speaker 4>and it's not a good fight.</v>

3682
02:41:44.820 --> 02:41:48.000
<v Speaker 4>It's this sort of fight that makes you wonder whether you should be it the damn</v>

3683
02:41:48.001 --> 02:41:48.834
<v Speaker 4>relationship.</v>

3684
02:41:49.530 --> 02:41:54.530
<v Speaker 4>And so every fight contending that direction is often quite people won't have</v>

3685
02:41:55.141 --> 02:41:58.830
<v Speaker 4>fights because we can open up that entire space of catastrophe.</v>

3686
02:41:59.190 --> 02:42:01.860
<v Speaker 4>And it's partly why you want to be serious about your vows.</v>

3687
02:42:02.490 --> 02:42:06.120
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to open up the possibility that you can leave every time you have</v>

3688
02:42:06.121 --> 02:42:06.600
<v Speaker 4>a fight.</v>

3689
02:42:06.600 --> 02:42:06.931
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3690
02:42:06.931 --> 02:42:07.590
<v Speaker 4>good God,</v>

3691
02:42:07.590 --> 02:42:08.970
<v Speaker 4>you really want that choice.</v>

3692
02:42:09.030 --> 02:42:10.920
<v Speaker 4>What that 40 day.</v>

3693
02:42:10.980 --> 02:42:11.311
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

3694
02:42:11.311 --> 02:42:12.420
<v Speaker 4>that's not freedom.</v>

3695
02:42:12.500 --> 02:42:17.160
<v Speaker 4>It's just chaos has some choices you don't want to have to make all the time.</v>

3696
02:42:17.370 --> 02:42:20.130
<v Speaker 4>It was hard enough to figure out that you should get married.</v>

3697
02:42:20.131 --> 02:42:20.230
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>

3698
02:42:20.230 --> 02:42:24.380
<v Speaker 4>you want to choose whether or not you're going to stay married every day because</v>

3699
02:42:24.430 --> 02:42:25.920
<v Speaker 4>that's just not good.</v>

3700
02:42:26.250 --> 02:42:26.940
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

3701
02:42:26.940 --> 02:42:27.530
<v Speaker 4>so anyway,</v>

3702
02:42:27.530 --> 02:42:32.530
<v Speaker 4>let's say you're having a fight with your wife and it's Brooklyn and you want to</v>

3703
02:42:32.821 --> 02:42:35.080
<v Speaker 4>win and the notion was wrong and he liked it,</v>

3704
02:42:35.081 --> 02:42:36.090
<v Speaker 4>a theater and all of that,</v>

3705
02:42:36.091 --> 02:42:38.790
<v Speaker 4>and you get to the addictive about it and she's seeing the same thing.</v>

3706
02:42:38.820 --> 02:42:40.830
<v Speaker 4>And so it's sort of spiraling out of control.</v>

3707
02:42:40.890 --> 02:42:42.600
<v Speaker 4>And so here's something you can do.</v>

3708
02:42:43.200 --> 02:42:47.520
<v Speaker 4>You can go your separate ways momentarily and you can sit on the edge of your</v>

3709
02:42:47.521 --> 02:42:48.780
<v Speaker 4>bed and you think,</v>

3710
02:42:50.310 --> 02:42:51.143
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3711
02:42:51.750 --> 02:42:54.410
<v Speaker 4>I probably did something outstanding,</v>

3712
02:42:54.550 --> 02:42:57.450
<v Speaker 4>stupid in the last three months.</v>

3713
02:42:57.990 --> 02:43:01.560
<v Speaker 4>Then increased the probability that you're having this terrible fight.</v>

3714
02:43:01.890 --> 02:43:03.120
<v Speaker 4>I'd probably get some,</v>

3715
02:43:04.260 --> 02:43:05.093
<v Speaker 4>what was it?</v>

3716
02:43:05.840 --> 02:43:10.050
<v Speaker 4>But you have to want to go down cause that's the prayer that's knocking on the</v>

3717
02:43:10.051 --> 02:43:10.321
<v Speaker 4>door.</v>

3718
02:43:10.321 --> 02:43:13.120
<v Speaker 4>We'll right ask and you will receive this like one,</v>

3719
02:43:13.121 --> 02:43:14.570
<v Speaker 4>it depends on when you ask for.</v>

3720
02:43:15.160 --> 02:43:17.830
<v Speaker 4>So if you ask from what would be best for you,</v>

3721
02:43:17.831 --> 02:43:19.030
<v Speaker 4>maybe you'll get it.</v>

3722
02:43:19.060 --> 02:43:20.600
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't mean that you'll like it.</v>

3723
02:43:21.520 --> 02:43:23.710
<v Speaker 4>And so if you sit on the edge of your bed and you think,</v>

3724
02:43:23.711 --> 02:43:24.544
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3725
02:43:25.600 --> 02:43:26.680
<v Speaker 4>in my maybe a seat,</v>

3726
02:43:26.710 --> 02:43:29.710
<v Speaker 4>what did I do to contribute to this horrible fight?</v>

3727
02:43:30.220 --> 02:43:34.030
<v Speaker 4>You sit there two or three minutes actually wanting to build the answer,</v>

3728
02:43:34.060 --> 02:43:37.450
<v Speaker 4>which you will know cause you don't want them to answer.</v>

3729
02:43:37.960 --> 02:43:38.700
<v Speaker 4>You'll get it.</v>

3730
02:43:38.700 --> 02:43:40.570
<v Speaker 4>You'll get an answer just as clear as could be.</v>

3731
02:43:40.571 --> 02:43:40.931
<v Speaker 4>You'll think,</v>

3732
02:43:40.931 --> 02:43:41.351
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>

3733
02:43:41.351 --> 02:43:42.041
<v Speaker 4>that's what I did.</v>

3734
02:43:42.041 --> 02:43:42.431
<v Speaker 4>That was,</v>

3735
02:43:42.431 --> 02:43:43.030
<v Speaker 4>and then you'll think,</v>

3736
02:43:43.030 --> 02:43:43.950
<v Speaker 4>well that's when county,</v>

3737
02:43:44.230 --> 02:43:46.560
<v Speaker 4>that's only contributing 5% of the problem.</v>

3738
02:43:46.570 --> 02:43:48.840
<v Speaker 4>She's still 99% of lane.</v>

3739
02:43:48.870 --> 02:43:49.703
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3740
02:43:49.720 --> 02:43:50.021
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3741
02:43:50.021 --> 02:43:52.960
<v Speaker 4>maybe guardian to 5% so that's been enough.</v>

3742
02:43:52.961 --> 02:43:57.820
<v Speaker 4>And then you can go back to her and maybe she's done the same thing and she</v>

3743
02:43:57.821 --> 02:43:58.511
<v Speaker 4>could tell you what,</v>

3744
02:43:58.511 --> 02:43:59.191
<v Speaker 4>she's an idiot.</v>

3745
02:43:59.191 --> 02:44:02.830
<v Speaker 4>Then you could tell her when you're an Indian and then you two idiots might be</v>

3746
02:44:02.831 --> 02:44:04.950
<v Speaker 4>able to have a conversation and solve the problem.</v>

3747
02:44:05.140 --> 02:44:07.180
<v Speaker 4>And that's a prayer.</v>

3748
02:44:07.480 --> 02:44:08.710
<v Speaker 4>And that work.</v>

3749
02:44:08.740 --> 02:44:12.910
<v Speaker 4>If you want to know why you're stupid and you ask yourself,</v>

3750
02:44:12.940 --> 02:44:13.870
<v Speaker 4>you will get announced.</v>

3751
02:44:14.810 --> 02:44:16.000
<v Speaker 4>And that's prayer.</v>

3752
02:44:16.030 --> 02:44:21.030
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible]</v>

3753
02:44:25.660 --> 02:44:27.750
<v Speaker 4>the one more in entire,</v>

3754
02:44:27.790 --> 02:44:30.130
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to say anything stupid.</v>

3755
02:44:32.860 --> 02:44:34.480
<v Speaker 4>What do I think of polygamy?</v>

3756
02:44:35.870 --> 02:44:38.290
<v Speaker 4>Give me personally or</v>

3757
02:44:43.220 --> 02:44:44.530
<v Speaker 4>I think that it's,</v>

3758
02:44:50.530 --> 02:44:52.900
<v Speaker 4>it leads to unstable societies.</v>

3759
02:44:52.910 --> 02:44:54.010
<v Speaker 4>It leads to unhappy,</v>

3760
02:44:54.370 --> 02:44:54.971
<v Speaker 4>resentful,</v>

3761
02:44:54.971 --> 02:44:55.511
<v Speaker 4>aggressive,</v>

3762
02:44:55.511 --> 02:44:56.380
<v Speaker 4>angry men.</v>

3763
02:44:57.250 --> 02:44:58.900
<v Speaker 4>Because there are men who don't have any women.</v>

3764
02:44:59.320 --> 02:45:01.700
<v Speaker 4>And that leads to the stabilization of society.</v>

3765
02:45:02.560 --> 02:45:03.610
<v Speaker 4>It's a bad idea,</v>

3766
02:45:03.880 --> 02:45:08.390
<v Speaker 4>which is why you see a strong proclivity towards monogamy among human cultures.</v>

3767
02:45:09.100 --> 02:45:10.100
<v Speaker 4>It's a clinic.</v>

3768
02:45:10.470 --> 02:45:10.991
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

3769
02:45:10.991 --> 02:45:14.950
<v Speaker 4>People are capable and willing to engage in polygamous relationships.</v>

3770
02:45:16.060 --> 02:45:17.740
<v Speaker 4>All things considered.</v>

3771
02:45:17.741 --> 02:45:19.180
<v Speaker 4>It's a bad solution,</v>

3772
02:45:19.780 --> 02:45:20.060
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3773
02:45:20.060 --> 02:45:22.210
<v Speaker 4>So what does all things considered me?</v>

3774
02:45:22.240 --> 02:45:23.073
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3775
02:45:23.230 --> 02:45:23.771
<v Speaker 4>you've got to think,</v>

3776
02:45:23.771 --> 02:45:23.921
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3777
02:45:23.921 --> 02:45:25.600
<v Speaker 4>what's good for you right now?</v>

3778
02:45:25.770 --> 02:45:25.940
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

3779
02:45:25.940 --> 02:45:29.470
<v Speaker 4>He might take unlimited sexual opportunity right now.</v>

3780
02:45:29.560 --> 02:45:31.740
<v Speaker 4>So it doesn't take much thinking to understand.</v>

3781
02:45:31.741 --> 02:45:35.710
<v Speaker 4>Probably probably that that's not a very sophisticated and so,</v>

3782
02:45:35.770 --> 02:45:37.060
<v Speaker 4>but if you're describing certs,</v>

3783
02:45:37.080 --> 02:45:38.140
<v Speaker 4>it might seem attractive.</v>

3784
02:45:38.980 --> 02:45:40.240
<v Speaker 4>What's good for you right now,</v>

3785
02:45:40.740 --> 02:45:41.950
<v Speaker 4>which is good for you right now in a way,</v>

3786
02:45:41.951 --> 02:45:43.210
<v Speaker 4>this good for you with a week,</v>

3787
02:45:43.690 --> 02:45:44.650
<v Speaker 4>it's good for you to month</v>

3788
02:45:46.620 --> 02:45:49.570
<v Speaker 4>it's been for you in 10 years is continue across your lifespan.</v>

3789
02:45:50.260 --> 02:45:51.093
<v Speaker 4>What is,</v>

3790
02:45:51.190 --> 02:45:51.491
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3791
02:45:51.491 --> 02:45:54.760
<v Speaker 4>we'll kind of know this probably better not to be alone.</v>

3792
02:45:55.360 --> 02:46:00.360
<v Speaker 4>It's probably better to have someone with you through your life because all</v>

3793
02:46:02.081 --> 02:46:02.950
<v Speaker 4>things considered,</v>

3794
02:46:02.951 --> 02:46:03.784
<v Speaker 4>it works better.</v>

3795
02:46:04.360 --> 02:46:07.240
<v Speaker 4>Now that doesn't mean it's a picnic or that it's easy for any of those things,</v>

3796
02:46:07.241 --> 02:46:08.290
<v Speaker 4>but of course it doesn't.</v>

3797
02:46:08.560 --> 02:46:09.393
<v Speaker 4>Of course not.</v>

3798
02:46:09.860 --> 02:46:11.420
<v Speaker 4>And then it isn't just put your finger for you,</v>

3799
02:46:11.530 --> 02:46:13.460
<v Speaker 4>it's which bigger for your family.</v>

3800
02:46:13.870 --> 02:46:17.540
<v Speaker 4>The evidence for that children is crystal clear and I can't believe we even have</v>

3801
02:46:17.541 --> 02:46:18.800
<v Speaker 4>this discussion in our society.</v>

3802
02:46:19.310 --> 02:46:21.580
<v Speaker 4>It's like other families in our work.</v>

3803
02:46:21.880 --> 02:46:26.880
<v Speaker 4>Well that doesn't mean that all families without fathers are catastrophes and it</v>

3804
02:46:27.021 --> 02:46:29.590
<v Speaker 4>doesn't get that all families with one if they're successful,</v>

3805
02:46:31.490 --> 02:46:32.870
<v Speaker 4>but the evidence is quite clear.</v>

3806
02:46:32.870 --> 02:46:37.640
<v Speaker 4>It looks to be like the nuclear family is the minimal viable social unit.</v>

3807
02:46:38.270 --> 02:46:39.440
<v Speaker 4>Now extended families,</v>

3808
02:46:39.680 --> 02:46:44.680
<v Speaker 4>they have the pros and the cons and maybe a also worker but you can't get it</v>

3809
02:46:44.720 --> 02:46:49.670
<v Speaker 4>smaller than husband and wife and have things work.</v>

3810
02:46:50.510 --> 02:46:51.440
<v Speaker 4>That's what it looks like.</v>

3811
02:46:51.441 --> 02:46:54.080
<v Speaker 4>And I think the psychological literature on that is quite clear.</v>

3812
02:46:54.710 --> 02:46:59.060
<v Speaker 4>So can I just get a conversation by the way with word Fairport who wrote a book</v>

3813
02:46:59.061 --> 02:47:03.500
<v Speaker 4>called the boy crisis and another book called why men earn more than both of</v>

3814
02:47:03.501 --> 02:47:07.490
<v Speaker 4>those books are for three and Pharaoh and I have a nice discussion about the</v>

3815
02:47:07.491 --> 02:47:11.100
<v Speaker 4>role that for this plate he really illuminated something to be,</v>

3816
02:47:11.110 --> 02:47:16.110
<v Speaker 4>he said that his research and indicated Amnon is primary research review of the</v>

3817
02:47:16.371 --> 02:47:18.280
<v Speaker 4>research that what fathers do.</v>

3818
02:47:18.470 --> 02:47:20.180
<v Speaker 4>This was so cool cause it's so smart.</v>

3819
02:47:20.690 --> 02:47:24.280
<v Speaker 4>I knew already that father's engage in rough and tumble play with their kids to</v>

3820
02:47:24.281 --> 02:47:27.250
<v Speaker 4>go to it to a higher proportion of degree.</v>

3821
02:47:27.590 --> 02:47:28.221
<v Speaker 4>Women do too,</v>

3822
02:47:28.221 --> 02:47:29.940
<v Speaker 4>but not as much as men tend to do it more.</v>

3823
02:47:30.440 --> 02:47:35.440
<v Speaker 4>And I knew that rough and tumble play and that kind of exciting exploratory</v>

3824
02:47:35.541 --> 02:47:38.600
<v Speaker 4>physical play was necessary for the development,</v>

3825
02:47:38.750 --> 02:47:40.940
<v Speaker 4>not only of children of animals as well.</v>

3826
02:47:40.941 --> 02:47:44.060
<v Speaker 4>You'll see the same thing happening with wraps for example and other sorts of</v>

3827
02:47:44.061 --> 02:47:44.500
<v Speaker 4>mammals.</v>

3828
02:47:44.500 --> 02:47:49.500
<v Speaker 4>They engaging couple of plates for all sorts of reasons and so that helps</v>

3829
02:47:49.551 --> 02:47:51.380
<v Speaker 4>children understand that when things are,</v>

3830
02:47:51.510 --> 02:47:54.040
<v Speaker 4>when they don't get what the extent of the body is,</v>

3831
02:47:54.290 --> 02:47:58.070
<v Speaker 4>what's exciting about play and how to trust someone when the stakes are rather</v>

3832
02:47:58.071 --> 02:48:01.130
<v Speaker 4>highlight when you'd be thrown in the air and all of these things and how to</v>

3833
02:48:01.131 --> 02:48:04.710
<v Speaker 4>take turns if you're playing with multiple kids at the same time,</v>

3834
02:48:04.850 --> 02:48:08.410
<v Speaker 4>how not to stick your thumb in your father's eye and what still finding what's</v>

3835
02:48:08.470 --> 02:48:12.300
<v Speaker 4>exciting and all of these things that are very complex and sophisticated and</v>

3836
02:48:12.640 --> 02:48:12.900
<v Speaker 4>humble.</v>

3837
02:48:12.900 --> 02:48:17.900
<v Speaker 4>Glade does that in children love it work like mad and engaging and fathers would</v>

3838
02:48:18.021 --> 02:48:21.830
<v Speaker 4>you'd like it to and it tends to terrify mothers because mothers are very</v>

3839
02:48:21.831 --> 02:48:23.270
<v Speaker 4>tightly bonded with their children,</v>

3840
02:48:23.271 --> 02:48:24.290
<v Speaker 4>especially when they're young.</v>

3841
02:48:24.560 --> 02:48:26.450
<v Speaker 4>They tend to be more on the protective side.</v>

3842
02:48:26.630 --> 02:48:27.530
<v Speaker 4>How sticky that way.</v>

3843
02:48:27.531 --> 02:48:28.850
<v Speaker 4>So there has to be that guy now,</v>

3844
02:48:29.300 --> 02:48:34.300
<v Speaker 4>but by Farrell said something very interesting which was that his understanding</v>

3845
02:48:34.491 --> 02:48:38.090
<v Speaker 4>is it would fathers do to scaffold delay of gratification,</v>

3846
02:48:38.120 --> 02:48:40.640
<v Speaker 4>which if that sacrificial attitude we already talking about,</v>

3847
02:48:40.641 --> 02:48:41.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3848
02:48:41.140 --> 02:48:46.140
<v Speaker 4>do something that you don't want to do now is difficult and don't impulsively</v>

3849
02:48:46.551 --> 02:48:50.750
<v Speaker 4>rewarding so that the future will be mattered and sort of the basis of civilized</v>

3850
02:48:50.780 --> 02:48:51.410
<v Speaker 4>endeavor.</v>

3851
02:48:51.410 --> 02:48:54.170
<v Speaker 4>Fundamentally it's the attitude that's necessary for work.</v>

3852
02:48:54.710 --> 02:48:59.710
<v Speaker 4>Pharaohs notion was that father scaffolded that by using play as a reward for</v>

3853
02:49:00.891 --> 02:49:04.910
<v Speaker 4>delay of gratification so far doesn't play with your kids and then that would be</v>

3854
02:49:04.911 --> 02:49:05.430
<v Speaker 4>enough for you.</v>

3855
02:49:05.430 --> 02:49:07.590
<v Speaker 4>Kids want to keep playing in the folks and look,</v>

3856
02:49:07.920 --> 02:49:09.570
<v Speaker 4>you know you can't play all the time.</v>

3857
02:49:09.630 --> 02:49:09.861
<v Speaker 4>Cool,</v>

3858
02:49:09.861 --> 02:49:10.800
<v Speaker 4>clean up your room,</v>

3859
02:49:10.830 --> 02:49:11.820
<v Speaker 4>go do your homework,</v>

3860
02:49:11.821 --> 02:49:12.660
<v Speaker 4>go set the table,</v>

3861
02:49:12.720 --> 02:49:14.100
<v Speaker 4>go do this little task,</v>

3862
02:49:14.101 --> 02:49:16.260
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is and then we'll place.</v>

3863
02:49:16.830 --> 02:49:17.221
<v Speaker 4>I thought,</v>

3864
02:49:17.221 --> 02:49:17.581
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

3865
02:49:17.581 --> 02:49:21.240
<v Speaker 4>that's so smart because you want to use a prime member of the board source to</v>

3866
02:49:21.241 --> 02:49:21.950
<v Speaker 4>scaffold them.</v>

3867
02:49:21.950 --> 02:49:24.270
<v Speaker 4>Delayed gratification can use food.</v>

3868
02:49:24.300 --> 02:49:26.580
<v Speaker 4>That's what you scratch and allowed for example,</v>

3869
02:49:26.581 --> 02:49:28.530
<v Speaker 4>but does not a great morning for kids.</v>

3870
02:49:28.531 --> 02:49:30.840
<v Speaker 4>Only you can use it for your toilet train for example,</v>

3871
02:49:31.050 --> 02:49:31.980
<v Speaker 4>can be very effective.</v>

3872
02:49:32.280 --> 02:49:36.540
<v Speaker 4>But that idea that what what fathers do is use play as a scaffold for teaching</v>

3873
02:49:36.541 --> 02:49:37.620
<v Speaker 4>delay of gratification.</v>

3874
02:49:37.621 --> 02:49:38.800
<v Speaker 4>I thought that was plugging really is.</v>

3875
02:49:39.150 --> 02:49:40.260
<v Speaker 4>And so anyways,</v>

3876
02:49:40.261 --> 02:49:42.660
<v Speaker 4>we had quite a lengthy discussion about the role of fathers.</v>

3877
02:49:43.020 --> 02:49:43.853
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

3878
02:49:44.400 --> 02:49:45.233
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3879
02:49:45.580 --> 02:49:46.680
<v Speaker 4>let me see here.</v>

3880
02:49:46.750 --> 02:49:50.540
<v Speaker 4>Now this is why I have to stop because I'm forgetting what the questions are</v>

3881
02:49:50.550 --> 02:49:51.270
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

3882
02:49:51.270 --> 02:49:51.780
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

3883
02:49:51.780 --> 02:49:52.613
<v Speaker 4>Oh yes,</v>

3884
02:49:53.260 --> 02:49:54.093
<v Speaker 4>I was</v>

3885
02:49:55.470 --> 02:49:56.110
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

3886
02:49:56.110 --> 02:49:59.490
<v Speaker 4>so the reason that you set up among the monogamous relationships as well,</v>

3887
02:49:59.491 --> 02:50:02.730
<v Speaker 4>it's not going to be that it's good for you and your future self and your wife</v>

3888
02:50:02.731 --> 02:50:04.710
<v Speaker 4>and her future self and you as a comparable,</v>

3889
02:50:04.711 --> 02:50:06.240
<v Speaker 4>but because it's good for your kids.</v>

3890
02:50:06.820 --> 02:50:09.930
<v Speaker 4>And I think part of the reason that you take the narrative about was because</v>

3891
02:50:09.931 --> 02:50:11.190
<v Speaker 4>that's the best thing for children.</v>

3892
02:50:11.191 --> 02:50:12.810
<v Speaker 4>And once you have children,</v>

3893
02:50:13.350 --> 02:50:14.790
<v Speaker 4>it's not about you anymore.</v>

3894
02:50:15.330 --> 02:50:17.280
<v Speaker 4>It's not spoken kit.</v>

3895
02:50:18.090 --> 02:50:18.361
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

3896
02:50:18.361 --> 02:50:21.000
<v Speaker 4>and that I think if the hallmark of adult responsibility,</v>

3897
02:50:21.480 --> 02:50:23.970
<v Speaker 4>and so play to me is not,</v>

3898
02:50:24.240 --> 02:50:26.640
<v Speaker 4>it's not commensurate with a fully functional,</v>

3899
02:50:26.641 --> 02:50:30.330
<v Speaker 4>civilized society and it tends to be generated to anarchic violence.</v>

3900
02:50:30.331 --> 02:50:33.000
<v Speaker 4>And so most cultures evolve away from it quite wrapping up.</v>

3901
02:50:33.900 --> 02:50:35.400
<v Speaker 4>So that's that.</v>

3902
02:50:35.460 --> 02:50:37.320
<v Speaker 4>And so thank you very much.</v>

3903
02:50:37.550 --> 02:50:42.550
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
