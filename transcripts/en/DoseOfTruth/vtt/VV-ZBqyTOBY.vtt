1
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.680
<v Speaker 1>And then the question is what rushes in to fill a vacuum?</v>

2
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.401
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3
00:00:10.401 --> 00:00:12.230
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the case of the Soviet Union,</v>

4
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.550
<v Speaker 1>it seems quite instructive,</v>

5
00:00:13.551 --> 00:00:14.130
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>

6
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:14.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

7
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.750
<v Speaker 1>there's a 30 year period where there's tremendous intellectual class say between</v>

8
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.790
<v Speaker 1>a materialist and empirical perspective and an Russian Orthodox perspective.</v>

9
00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.820
<v Speaker 1>The Russian Orthodox perspective loses its attractiveness for the reigning</v>

10
00:00:31.821 --> 00:00:35.480
<v Speaker 1>intellectual elite and the preset positions of communism,</v>

11
00:00:35.481 --> 00:00:37.490
<v Speaker 1>which appear rational by contrast,</v>

12
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.300
<v Speaker 1>which by all evidence we're not rush in to fill the gap.</v>

13
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.270
<v Speaker 1>And I want to read you something that nature wrote.</v>

14
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.540
<v Speaker 1>It's perhaps the most famous thing he ever said,</v>

15
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.320
<v Speaker 1>although it's almost entirely taken out of context and misquoted and if not</v>

16
00:00:51.321 --> 00:00:51.830
<v Speaker 1>misquoted,</v>

17
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:52.970
<v Speaker 1>at least misunderstood.</v>

18
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.650
<v Speaker 1>Because nature was one of these strange people who was capable of living 50 or</v>

19
00:00:57.651 --> 00:00:59.270
<v Speaker 1>even 100 years into the future.</v>

20
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:00.470
<v Speaker 1>And although he was,</v>

21
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.480
<v Speaker 1>is generally regarded as an enemy of Christianity and superstition and was</v>

22
00:01:05.481 --> 00:01:09.410
<v Speaker 1>certainly an unbelievably outspoken opponent of Christian traditionalism.</v>

23
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.790
<v Speaker 1>He also knew that if you let the old gods die,</v>

24
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.920
<v Speaker 1>the probability that blood would flood the land was virtually 100% so let me</v>

25
00:01:18.921 --> 00:01:20.030
<v Speaker 1>read you what he wrote.</v>

26
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.170
<v Speaker 1>Have you not heard of that mad man who lit a lantern in the bright morning</v>

27
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.560
<v Speaker 1>hours,</v>

28
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.080
<v Speaker 1>ran to the market place and cried incessantly?</v>

29
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.630
<v Speaker 1>I seek God as many of those who do not believe in God were standing around just</v>

30
00:01:35.631 --> 00:01:35.841
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

31
00:01:35.841 --> 00:01:37.640
<v Speaker 1>He provoked must much laughter.</v>

32
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.250
<v Speaker 1>Why did he get lost?</v>

33
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.113
<v Speaker 1>Said one.</v>

34
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.690
<v Speaker 1>Did he lose his way like a child said another or is he hiding?</v>

35
00:01:44.691 --> 00:01:47.800
<v Speaker 1>Is he afraid of us because he gone on a voyage or emigrated?</v>

36
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:49.880
<v Speaker 1>That's the yelled and laughed.</v>

37
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.080
<v Speaker 1>The Madman jumped into their midst and pierced them with his glances.</v>

38
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.340
<v Speaker 1>Where there is God,</v>

39
00:01:55.341 --> 00:01:55.941
<v Speaker 1>he cried.</v>

40
00:01:55.941 --> 00:01:56.810
<v Speaker 1>I shall tell you,</v>

41
00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.070
<v Speaker 1>we have killed him.</v>

42
00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.083
<v Speaker 1>You and I,</v>

43
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.980
<v Speaker 1>all of us are as murderers,</v>

44
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.080
<v Speaker 1>but how have we done this?</v>

45
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.660
<v Speaker 1>How were we able to drink up the sea?</v>

46
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.290
<v Speaker 1>Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the entire horizon.</v>

47
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.790
<v Speaker 1>What did we do when we unchained this earth from its sun?</v>

48
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.400
<v Speaker 1>Whether is it moving now,</v>

49
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.450
<v Speaker 1>whether are we moving now weigh from all sons?</v>

50
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.290
<v Speaker 1>Are we not plunging continuously backwards,</v>

51
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.890
<v Speaker 1>sideward forward in all directions?</v>

52
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.950
<v Speaker 1>Is there any up or down left?</v>

53
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.270
<v Speaker 1>Are we not straying as though through an infinite nothing?</v>

54
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.030
<v Speaker 1>Do we not feel the breath of empty space?</v>

55
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.390
<v Speaker 1>Has it not become colder is not night and more night coming on all the while?</v>

56
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.450
<v Speaker 1>Must not lanterns be lit in the morning.</v>

57
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.010
<v Speaker 1>Do we not hear anything yet of the noise of the grave diggers who are burying</v>

58
00:02:52.011 --> 00:02:52.844
<v Speaker 1>God?</v>

59
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.790
<v Speaker 1>Do we not smell anything yet of God's decomposition?</v>

60
00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.770
<v Speaker 1>God's to decompose.</v>

61
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 1>God is dead.</v>

62
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:01.810
<v Speaker 1>God remains dead.</v>

63
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.070
<v Speaker 1>We have killed him.</v>

64
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.561
<v Speaker 1>How much shall we,</v>

65
00:03:05.561 --> 00:03:07.300
<v Speaker 1>the murderer of all murderers,</v>

66
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.160
<v Speaker 1>comfort ourselves?</v>

67
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.690
<v Speaker 1>What was holiest and most powerful of all that the world has yet owned has bled</v>

68
00:03:13.691 --> 00:03:15.160
<v Speaker 1>to death under our knives.</v>

69
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.170
<v Speaker 1>Who will wipe this blood office?</v>

70
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.290
<v Speaker 1>What water is there for us to clean ourselves?</v>

71
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.210
<v Speaker 1>What festivals of Atonement?</v>

72
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.790
<v Speaker 1>What Sacred Games shall we have to invent?</v>

73
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.940
<v Speaker 1>He's not the greatness of this deed too great for us.</v>

74
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.480
<v Speaker 1>Must we not ourselves become God simply to seem worthy of.</v>

75
00:03:31.481 --> 00:03:32.314
<v Speaker 1>It</v>

76
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.700
<v Speaker 1>allows you can tell that's a much different notion from the casual God is dead</v>

77
00:03:45.171 --> 00:03:48.030
<v Speaker 1>quotation that's most generally associated with nature.</v>

78
00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

79
00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.190
<v Speaker 1>what is he saying?</v>

80
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.881
<v Speaker 1>What he's saying?</v>

81
00:03:49.881 --> 00:03:50.900
<v Speaker 1>Something like this.</v>

82
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.790
<v Speaker 1>A system like Christianity or any system that's con,</v>

83
00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.950
<v Speaker 1>that's oriented as society for thousands and thousands of years can't simply be</v>

84
00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.410
<v Speaker 1>eradicated by a casual gesture,</v>

85
00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.890
<v Speaker 1>without consequences in suing and its aftermath.</v>

86
00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.580
<v Speaker 1>What consequences will need you says,</v>

87
00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.751
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

88
00:04:14.751 --> 00:04:16.550
<v Speaker 1>we all know longer know up from down.</v>

89
00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.450
<v Speaker 1>What does he mean by that metaphorically?</v>

90
00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:21.770
<v Speaker 1>Well App.</v>

91
00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:22.850
<v Speaker 1>That's where you're headed,</v>

92
00:04:22.851 --> 00:04:24.110
<v Speaker 1>right and down.</v>

93
00:04:24.111 --> 00:04:27.620
<v Speaker 1>That's what you want to stay away from and when you eradicate the most</v>

94
00:04:27.621 --> 00:04:30.950
<v Speaker 1>fundamental presuppositions of your system of values,</v>

95
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.030
<v Speaker 1>then there is no up and there is no down and then where are you precisely?</v>

96
00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.871
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

97
00:04:35.871 --> 00:04:36.890
<v Speaker 1>it's not so easy.</v>

98
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.900
<v Speaker 1>It's not so easy to say having not necessarily ever been in that position.</v>

99
00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.000
<v Speaker 1>What is your life like when you don't know?</v>

100
00:04:44.001 --> 00:04:44.631
<v Speaker 1>Up from down?</v>

101
00:04:44.631 --> 00:04:45.830
<v Speaker 1>Is it merely neutral?</v>

102
00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.170
<v Speaker 1>Is to is they're merely no value left.</v>

103
00:04:48.171 --> 00:04:52.640
<v Speaker 1>Or could it possibly be the case that if up and down have both been eradicated,</v>

104
00:04:52.641 --> 00:04:56.690
<v Speaker 1>that the place that you're left in is something much more akin to a permanent</v>

105
00:04:56.691 --> 00:05:01.691
<v Speaker 1>state of suffering because maybe it's only the case that the constant capacity</v>

106
00:05:02.571 --> 00:05:07.571
<v Speaker 1>to strive for up in being an up that you believe in the constant striving for up</v>

107
00:05:08.151 --> 00:05:10.220
<v Speaker 1>is actually what makes your life bearable to you.</v>

108
00:05:10.221 --> 00:05:12.230
<v Speaker 1>And if you lost the sense of up and down,</v>

109
00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.310
<v Speaker 1>the place that you would end up would be not so much neutral as terrible.</v>

110
00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.271
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

111
00:05:17.271 --> 00:05:19.160
<v Speaker 1>if you have any belief system at all,</v>

112
00:05:19.161 --> 00:05:19.761
<v Speaker 1>you do this.</v>

113
00:05:19.761 --> 00:05:22.820
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you're an advocate of left wing politics.</v>

114
00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.300
<v Speaker 1>You take a pro environmental stance or an anti corporate stance.</v>

115
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.330
<v Speaker 1>This is a relatively common thing to do among undergraduates.</v>

116
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.450
<v Speaker 1>What do you do when you hold that belief system?</v>

117
00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.880
<v Speaker 1>You view the world as it lays itself out and you explain the manner in which it</v>

118
00:05:37.881 --> 00:05:41.510
<v Speaker 1>manifests itself in terms of the axioms of that belief system.</v>

119
00:05:41.511 --> 00:05:44.210
<v Speaker 1>And you may know that you can do it right.</v>

120
00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.540
<v Speaker 1>You can tell a credible story about why the world is the way it is by adopting</v>

121
00:05:49.701 --> 00:05:49.971
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

122
00:05:49.971 --> 00:05:54.260
<v Speaker 1>an anti corporate perspective because there are all sorts of terrible things</v>

123
00:05:54.261 --> 00:05:57.020
<v Speaker 1>about the world that are a consequence say of corporate.</v>

124
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.350
<v Speaker 1>And you might also say that,</v>

125
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.580
<v Speaker 1>and Piaget would say this,</v>

126
00:06:01.581 --> 00:06:06.581
<v Speaker 1>that it's a necessary developmental stage to acquire allegiance to a given</v>

127
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:08.600
<v Speaker 1>belief system.</v>

128
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.823
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

129
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:10.281
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

130
00:06:10.281 --> 00:06:11.930
<v Speaker 1>any APP is better than none.</v>

131
00:06:11.931 --> 00:06:14.270
<v Speaker 1>That might be the first observation.</v>

132
00:06:14.271 --> 00:06:18.470
<v Speaker 1>So even if your belief system is relatively insufficient and easily challenged</v>

133
00:06:18.471 --> 00:06:21.170
<v Speaker 1>on an intellectual grounds and perhaps not very complete anyways,</v>

134
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.320
<v Speaker 1>the fact that it does lay out a moral structure for you and tell you,</v>

135
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:25.041
<v Speaker 1>good for me,</v>

136
00:06:25.041 --> 00:06:26.420
<v Speaker 1>evil and right from wrong,</v>

137
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:27.643
<v Speaker 1>that's up.</v>

138
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:28.580
<v Speaker 1>That's a plus.</v>

139
00:06:28.581 --> 00:06:29.720
<v Speaker 1>That's an advantage.</v>

140
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:34.100
<v Speaker 1>Now it's relative intellectual weakness and it's incoherence.</v>

141
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:34.790
<v Speaker 1>Assuming it,</v>

142
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:36.680
<v Speaker 1>it is incoherent to some degree,</v>

143
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.180
<v Speaker 1>that's a flaw,</v>

144
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.570
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that the effort to establish a system like that is</v>

145
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:42.553
<v Speaker 1>worthless.</v>

146
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.020
<v Speaker 1>It's worthwhile and neat.</v>

147
00:06:44.021 --> 00:06:44.481
<v Speaker 1>Just said,</v>

148
00:06:44.481 --> 00:06:46.730
<v Speaker 1>say with regards to Christianity and Europe,</v>

149
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:48.373
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

150
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:50.240
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

151
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.500
<v Speaker 1>the errors,</v>

152
00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:56.450
<v Speaker 1>intellectual and moral of Institutional Christianity are essentially beyond</v>

153
00:06:56.451 --> 00:06:57.284
<v Speaker 1>count.</v>

154
00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.070
<v Speaker 1>But there's one thing you have to remember,</v>

155
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:03.051
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

156
00:07:03.051 --> 00:07:06.920
<v Speaker 1>in ordering of that sort is necessary because the alternative,</v>

157
00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.090
<v Speaker 1>which is always hidden from you in so far as you're inside a moral system,</v>

158
00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:15.050
<v Speaker 1>the alternative as far worse chaos that's worse.</v>
