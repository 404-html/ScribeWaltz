00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:07.521
<v Speaker 1>Relationships,</v>

2
00:00:07.521 --> 00:00:08.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:08.500
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

4
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:08.870
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

5
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.340
<v Speaker 1>what they do is me taking fragile piece and I actually think that probably works</v>

6
00:00:13.341 --> 00:00:14.120
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

7
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.890
<v Speaker 1>if you're bounded by roles.</v>

8
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.500
<v Speaker 1>And this was a union observation.</v>

9
00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.580
<v Speaker 1>So Yoga belief that you didn't have to have an individual relationship if you</v>

10
00:00:23.581 --> 00:00:27.890
<v Speaker 1>were in a traditional culture because women did women phase and then did men</v>

11
00:00:27.891 --> 00:00:32.510
<v Speaker 1>things and they walked along the path in parallel and there were no conflicts</v>

12
00:00:32.511 --> 00:00:34.140
<v Speaker 1>because there were no their word.</v>

13
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.360
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

14
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.350
<v Speaker 1>they're there.</v>

15
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.340
<v Speaker 1>Most of what you were supposed to do was laid out for you.</v>

16
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:41.390
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

17
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:42.980
<v Speaker 1>modern people don't like that idea,</v>

18
00:00:42.981 --> 00:00:46.310
<v Speaker 1>but just trying to go shooting over who should do,</v>

19
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.020
<v Speaker 1>who should cook dinner,</v>

20
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.830
<v Speaker 1>see if you can settle that before you make a decision about whether the rules</v>

21
00:00:51.831 --> 00:00:52.670
<v Speaker 1>are useful or not.</v>

22
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.451
<v Speaker 1>Cause you know,</v>

23
00:00:53.451 --> 00:00:55.010
<v Speaker 1>I'd be in lots of houses where that fight,</v>

24
00:00:55.011 --> 00:00:56.810
<v Speaker 1>it'd been going on for 35 years.</v>

25
00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:58.363
<v Speaker 1>Never solved.</v>

26
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.190
<v Speaker 1>So hitch could need neo was,</v>

27
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.390
<v Speaker 1>the food was terrible.</v>

28
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.730
<v Speaker 1>The husband and wife were at each other's throats,</v>

29
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

30
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.463
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

31
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.360
<v Speaker 1>So it's really hard once you're under the rules to,</v>

32
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:11.720
<v Speaker 1>once you're out of the rules,</v>

33
00:01:11.721 --> 00:01:13.190
<v Speaker 1>you have to do it as an individual.</v>

34
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.480
<v Speaker 1>But that's a trek,</v>

35
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:15.680
<v Speaker 1>tremendous demand.</v>

36
00:01:15.681 --> 00:01:16.940
<v Speaker 1>It's an unbelievable demand.</v>

37
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.780
<v Speaker 1>It's the same demand that essentially the Dostoyevsky put on himself.</v>

38
00:01:20.781 --> 00:01:24.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like we're partners will say,</v>

39
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.410
<v Speaker 1>you are one weird and unwieldy and malevolent and peculiar creature and so</v>

40
00:01:29.871 --> 00:01:30.351
<v Speaker 1>alive.</v>

41
00:01:30.351 --> 00:01:33.410
<v Speaker 1>So like how the hell are we going to sort that out?</v>

42
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.553
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

43
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.990
<v Speaker 1>you better be awake if you're going to sort that out and they fuck you all heard</v>

44
00:01:39.991 --> 00:01:41.550
<v Speaker 1>of him is the Gottman situation,</v>

45
00:01:41.551 --> 00:01:41.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

46
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.410
<v Speaker 1>Everything's fine and your heart's racing and your cordisol is generating and</v>

47
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.990
<v Speaker 1>you know you're having murderous streams.</v>

48
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.490
<v Speaker 1>I've had clients who were very motivated to commit homicide and they had their</v>

49
00:01:55.651 --> 00:01:56.484
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>

50
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.900
<v Speaker 1>One client I'm thinking about,</v>

51
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.930
<v Speaker 1>she thought it was their moral duty to do this because the person that she paid</v>

52
00:02:02.931 --> 00:02:05.790
<v Speaker 1>it had really hurt their family.</v>

53
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.170
<v Speaker 1>Like not in some trivial way,</v>

54
00:02:07.171 --> 00:02:10.830
<v Speaker 1>but like hurt them as badly as she possibly could,</v>

55
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.200
<v Speaker 1>but there was nothing she could do about it.</v>

56
00:02:13.201 --> 00:02:14.970
<v Speaker 1>There was no legal recourse.</v>

57
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.310
<v Speaker 1>And so she was a very moral person.</v>

58
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.533
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

59
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.190
<v Speaker 1>somewhat I would say</v>

60
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.880
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter if she's a very moral person.</v>

61
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.630
<v Speaker 1>This was just driving her crazy.</v>

62
00:02:25.631 --> 00:02:26.680
<v Speaker 1>It's like I have to act,</v>

63
00:02:26.681 --> 00:02:27.260
<v Speaker 1>I have to ask.</v>

64
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.550
<v Speaker 1>I can't just let this person get away with it because it was also ongoing.</v>

65
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

66
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.473
<v Speaker 1>but what are you going to say?</v>

67
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

68
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.330
<v Speaker 1>stop thinking about that.</v>

69
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

70
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.020
<v Speaker 1>you could put your thoughts to a more productive use.</v>

71
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

72
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:40.580
<v Speaker 1>it's not helpful.</v>

73
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:41.091
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

74
00:02:41.091 --> 00:02:43.970
<v Speaker 1>you can't help a person like that at all until you put your,</v>

75
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.890
<v Speaker 1>you put yourself in their situation.</v>

76
00:02:45.891 --> 00:02:46.161
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>

77
00:02:46.161 --> 00:02:46.940
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

78
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.310
<v Speaker 1>if I was in that situation and that had happened,</v>

79
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:50.780
<v Speaker 1>what would I do?</v>

80
00:02:50.781 --> 00:02:52.160
<v Speaker 1>And then the first thing I thought was,</v>

81
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.401
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

82
00:02:52.401 --> 00:02:54.590
<v Speaker 1>I'd be having the same kind of burgers fantasies.</v>

83
00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.880
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

84
00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.790
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't seem like it's possible that that's not a great,</v>

85
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.970
<v Speaker 1>so let's see if we can come up with something else.</v>

86
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:04.630
<v Speaker 1>But the danger there is that you have to put yourself in that situation.</v>

87
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.060
<v Speaker 1>And people don't like to do that because they think,</v>

88
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.860
<v Speaker 1>oh well I'd never have murdered his fantasies.</v>

89
00:03:08.861 --> 00:03:13.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you would never have murderous fantasies,</v>

90
00:03:13.301 --> 00:03:15.130
<v Speaker 1>I would actually say there's something wrong with you.</v>

91
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.920
<v Speaker 1>If you're not capable of that.</v>

92
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.620
<v Speaker 1>Then there's like there's a path of you missing.</v>

93
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.180
<v Speaker 1>It's in there man,</v>

94
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:23.511
<v Speaker 1>and when and when.</v>

95
00:03:23.511 --> 00:03:26.710
<v Speaker 1>When someone's pushing on you at some point in your life and they will,</v>

96
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.340
<v Speaker 1>you better have that reserve capacity or they're just gonna mow you right over</v>

97
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.090
<v Speaker 1>so you could see what this would mean.</v>

98
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.500
<v Speaker 1>It would simply mean that before presenting your own point of view,</v>

99
00:03:38.501 --> 00:03:41.800
<v Speaker 1>it would be necessary for you to really achieve the other speakers frame of</v>

100
00:03:41.801 --> 00:03:46.720
<v Speaker 1>reference to understand his thoughts and feeling so well that you can summarize</v>

101
00:03:46.721 --> 00:03:47.554
<v Speaker 1>them for him.</v>

102
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:48.611
<v Speaker 1>Sounds simple,</v>

103
00:03:48.611 --> 00:03:49.444
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>

104
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.771
<v Speaker 1>But if you try it,</v>

105
00:03:50.771 --> 00:03:54.040
<v Speaker 1>you will discover it is one of the most difficult things I've ever tried to do.</v>

106
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:56.560
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

107
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.290
<v Speaker 1>once you have been able to see the other's point of view,</v>

108
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.340
<v Speaker 1>your own comments,</v>

109
00:04:00.341 --> 00:04:02.080
<v Speaker 1>we'll have to be drastic and revised.</v>

110
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.560
<v Speaker 1>You will also find the emotion going out of the discussion,</v>

111
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.790
<v Speaker 1>the differences being reduced and those differences which remain being up a</v>

112
00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:11.590
<v Speaker 1>rational and understandable sore.</v>

113
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.690
<v Speaker 1>Roger's thought that courage was a prerequisite for empathic understanding.</v>

114
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:20.161
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting too,</v>

115
00:04:20.161 --> 00:04:22.320
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

116
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.770
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

117
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:23.171
<v Speaker 1>here's a,</v>

118
00:04:23.171 --> 00:04:24.360
<v Speaker 1>here's a question for you.</v>

119
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.293
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

120
00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.970
<v Speaker 1>should you trust people</v>

121
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.730
<v Speaker 1>or more specifically,</v>

122
00:04:29.731 --> 00:04:29.941
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

123
00:04:29.941 --> 00:04:31.110
<v Speaker 1>should I trust you?</v>

124
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.371
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

125
00:04:32.371 --> 00:04:35.310
<v Speaker 1>you might think if you've heard me talk,</v>

126
00:04:35.311 --> 00:04:35.790
<v Speaker 1>you'd think,</v>

127
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.971
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

128
00:04:35.971 --> 00:04:39.060
<v Speaker 1>there's no way you should trust a person because they're just so full of snakes</v>

129
00:04:39.061 --> 00:04:41.910
<v Speaker 1>and malevolence that it's just absolutely mind boggling.</v>

130
00:04:41.911 --> 00:04:44.700
<v Speaker 1>So why in the world would you ever trust something like that?</v>

131
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:46.890
<v Speaker 1>Well then you can think about it this way.</v>

132
00:04:46.891 --> 00:04:48.030
<v Speaker 1>There's two kinds of trust.</v>

133
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.150
<v Speaker 1>There's the kind of trust you have when you're too stupid to know better and</v>

134
00:04:51.151 --> 00:04:51.990
<v Speaker 1>that's not trust.</v>

135
00:04:51.991 --> 00:04:52.890
<v Speaker 1>That's naivete.</v>

136
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.480
<v Speaker 1>And that is not a moral virtue.</v>

137
00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.690
<v Speaker 1>And there's the kind of trust you have when you know that the person you're</v>

138
00:04:57.691 --> 00:05:02.340
<v Speaker 1>talking to and you are completely full of snakes and you decide as an act of</v>

139
00:05:02.341 --> 00:05:06.600
<v Speaker 1>courage that you're going to trust the person anyways because that of all the</v>

140
00:05:06.601 --> 00:05:11.490
<v Speaker 1>things you could do to help lead them and the discussion towards the light,</v>

141
00:05:11.491 --> 00:05:12.510
<v Speaker 1>that's the most important.</v>

142
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:12.961
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

143
00:05:12.961 --> 00:05:17.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to assume that you know,</v>

144
00:05:17.041 --> 00:05:18.030
<v Speaker 1>our interactions,</v>

145
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.870
<v Speaker 1>your impulse towards the good is going to be victorious.</v>

146
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.560
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

147
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.393
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

148
00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:24.450
<v Speaker 1>If you're interested in this,</v>

149
00:05:24.451 --> 00:05:25.240
<v Speaker 1>you could go online.</v>

150
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.490
<v Speaker 1>You can watch Paul Bernardo,</v>

151
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.350
<v Speaker 1>you remember Old Paul Bernardo.</v>

152
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.940
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

153
00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.840
<v Speaker 1>There's videos of Paul Bernardo online when he's talking to a bunch of RCMP</v>

154
00:05:33.841 --> 00:05:35.340
<v Speaker 1>officers and judges.</v>

155
00:05:35.341 --> 00:05:39.180
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to extract some more information from him about some murders that</v>

156
00:05:39.181 --> 00:05:40.170
<v Speaker 1>remained unsolved.</v>

157
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.900
<v Speaker 1>You want to see a psychopath and operation.</v>

158
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.820
<v Speaker 1>You can just watch those videos.</v>

159
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:45.840
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

160
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.451
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

161
00:05:46.451 --> 00:05:48.900
<v Speaker 1>he runs the meeting like he's the CEO of Apple.</v>

162
00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:50.303
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

163
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:51.620
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

164
00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:52.560
<v Speaker 1>and that's a problem,</v>

165
00:05:52.561 --> 00:05:54.750
<v Speaker 1>I would say to some degree for the Rogerian approach,</v>

166
00:05:54.751 --> 00:05:54.961
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

167
00:05:54.961 --> 00:05:55.794
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>

168
00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.640
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

169
00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:57.950
<v Speaker 1>what about Paul Bernardo,</v>

170
00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:59.533
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

171
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.830
<v Speaker 1>is everyone fundamentally oriented towards the good?</v>

172
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.233
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

173
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.390
<v Speaker 1>It's a reasonable presupposition.</v>

174
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.650
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time I think it works better if societies organize themselves</v>

175
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.690
<v Speaker 1>according to that principal because otherwise we know,</v>

176
00:06:14.691 --> 00:06:15.231
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

177
00:06:15.231 --> 00:06:16.064
<v Speaker 1>that one of the,</v>

178
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.113
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>

179
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.590
<v Speaker 1>what's a natural resource</v>

180
00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:20.310
<v Speaker 2>oil,</v>

181
00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:21.090
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

182
00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:21.923
<v Speaker 2>For a</v>

183
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.610
<v Speaker 1>bauxite or iron ore or forget about all that.</v>

184
00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.510
<v Speaker 1>The fundamental natural resource is trust.</v>

185
00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.040
<v Speaker 1>So if you look around the world and you look at economies like Japan for</v>

186
00:06:35.041 --> 00:06:35.431
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

187
00:06:35.431 --> 00:06:37.080
<v Speaker 1>Japan has no natural resources,</v>

188
00:06:37.081 --> 00:06:37.680
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

189
00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.090
<v Speaker 1>While they're filthy rich.</v>

190
00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:39.983
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

191
00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.980
<v Speaker 1>Because of the economy is basically predicated on interpersonal trust.</v>

192
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.810
<v Speaker 1>So when there's been some lovely work done in economics regarding precisely</v>

193
00:06:48.811 --> 00:06:49.141
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

194
00:06:49.141 --> 00:06:49.980
<v Speaker 1>without trust,</v>

195
00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:53.370
<v Speaker 1>your oil just sits in the ground or it leaks out of the pipelines because nobody</v>

196
00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:54.330
<v Speaker 1>welded them property.</v>

197
00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:55.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

198
00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:55.831
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

199
00:06:55.831 --> 00:06:56.664
<v Speaker 1>there isn't,</v>

200
00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.180
<v Speaker 1>there's no reason to assume that you're going to be able to do anything</v>

201
00:07:00.181 --> 00:07:01.500
<v Speaker 1>cooperative or collaborative.</v>

202
00:07:01.501 --> 00:07:02.850
<v Speaker 1>So trust is a necessity.</v>

203
00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:05.940
<v Speaker 1>If you're really willing to understand a person in this way,</v>

204
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.840
<v Speaker 1>if you're willing to enter his private world is see the way life appears to him.</v>

205
00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.300
<v Speaker 1>You run the risk of being changed yourself.</v>

206
00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:14.490
<v Speaker 1>You might see it his way.</v>

207
00:07:14.491 --> 00:07:17.430
<v Speaker 1>You might find yourself influenced in your attitudes or personality.</v>

208
00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.750
<v Speaker 1>The risk of being changed is one of the most frightening prospects most of us</v>

209
00:07:21.751 --> 00:07:22.584
<v Speaker 1>can face.</v>

210
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:27.090
<v Speaker 1>If I enter as fully as I am able into the private world of the neurotic or</v>

211
00:07:27.091 --> 00:07:28.350
<v Speaker 1>psychotic individual,</v>

212
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.080
<v Speaker 1>isn't there a risk that I might become lost in that world?</v>

213
00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.750
<v Speaker 1>Most of us are afraid to take that risk.</v>

214
00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.090
<v Speaker 1>The great majority of us cannot listen.</v>

215
00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:41.130
<v Speaker 1>We find ourselves compelled to evaluate because listening is too dangerous.</v>

216
00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:44.490
<v Speaker 1>The first requirement is courage and we do not always have it.</v>

217
00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:49.493
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

218
00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:51.930
<v Speaker 1>so it says three o'clock on this,</v>

219
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:53.103
<v Speaker 1>is that right?</v>

220
00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:53.970
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

221
00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:55.260
<v Speaker 1>That's a good place to stop there.</v>
