00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.450
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.580
<v Speaker 2>I told you at the beginning of the class that</v>

3
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.180
<v Speaker 2>I started working on this material.</v>

4
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.460
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

5
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.380
<v Speaker 2>Partly because I was interested in why.</v>

6
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:33.240
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

7
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.180
<v Speaker 2>People were so inclined to,</v>

8
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.150
<v Speaker 2>to go to any lengths to protect their belief systems.</v>

9
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.530
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to understand,</v>

10
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.230
<v Speaker 2>and I knew that those were systems of value,</v>

11
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.531
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

12
00:00:46.531 --> 00:00:51.420
<v Speaker 2>That that belief system is something that enables you to ascribe value to things</v>

13
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.480
<v Speaker 2>so that so that you can act in the world towards things in a way from things,</v>

14
00:00:57.631 --> 00:00:58.530
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking,</v>

15
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.353
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

16
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.060
<v Speaker 2>I've already made a case to you,</v>

17
00:01:03.061 --> 00:01:03.894
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

18
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.860
<v Speaker 2>belief systems regulate people's own emotions,</v>

19
00:01:07.861 --> 00:01:08.694
<v Speaker 2>but not,</v>

20
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.750
<v Speaker 2>not as a consequence of decreasing their death,</v>

21
00:01:13.751 --> 00:01:15.760
<v Speaker 2>anxiety or anything like that,</v>

22
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.910
<v Speaker 2>or even directly decreasing their,</v>

23
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.760
<v Speaker 2>their threat sensitivity or uncertainty,</v>

24
00:01:21.761 --> 00:01:26.761
<v Speaker 2>but more specifically by helping them orient themselves in the world so that</v>

25
00:01:28.481 --> 00:01:32.260
<v Speaker 2>what they do matches what they want in the social environment.</v>

26
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.860
<v Speaker 2>And it's an important set of distinctions because the emotional control that</v>

27
00:01:38.921 --> 00:01:43.921
<v Speaker 2>belief systems allow is mediated by success in the social environment.</v>

28
00:01:44.081 --> 00:01:45.040
<v Speaker 2>That's the crucial thing.</v>

29
00:01:45.041 --> 00:01:45.874
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

30
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.620
<v Speaker 2>it's not directly.</v>

31
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.970
<v Speaker 2>It's not as if you're holding a belief system and that's directly inhibiting</v>

32
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.280
<v Speaker 2>somehow your emotional responsivity.</v>

33
00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.480
<v Speaker 2>It's more that you share.</v>

34
00:01:58.481 --> 00:02:03.481
<v Speaker 2>You have a motive orienting yourself in the world so that other people can</v>

35
00:02:03.761 --> 00:02:08.020
<v Speaker 2>understand what you're up to so that you can cooperate and compete with them</v>

36
00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.940
<v Speaker 2>without conflict and the fact that you can do that without conflict and maybe</v>

37
00:02:12.941 --> 00:02:13.960
<v Speaker 2>even with cooperation,</v>

38
00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.760
<v Speaker 2>that's what regulates your emotion.</v>

39
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.940
<v Speaker 2>So it's not only the fact of the beliefs belief system,</v>

40
00:02:18.941 --> 00:02:23.350
<v Speaker 2>it's the fact that it's shared with everyone else and so</v>

41
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.060
<v Speaker 2>people are willing to defend their belief systems because they're defending the</v>

42
00:02:31.661 --> 00:02:35.350
<v Speaker 2>territorial structure that enables them to</v>

43
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.870
<v Speaker 2>make sense of the world and then to act out making sense of the world with</v>

44
00:02:40.871 --> 00:02:41.920
<v Speaker 2>everyone else around them.</v>

45
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.260
<v Speaker 2>Now then the question arises,</v>

46
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.600
<v Speaker 2>what if two different groups of people have different belief systems?</v>

47
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.370
<v Speaker 2>What do you do in a situation like that?</v>

48
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.020
<v Speaker 2>And one answer is</v>

49
00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:58.600
<v Speaker 2>you capitulate.</v>

50
00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.460
<v Speaker 2>Another answer is that you fight.</v>

51
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.440
<v Speaker 2>Another answer might be that you come to some consensus about how the difference</v>

52
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:09.790
<v Speaker 2>between those different belief systems might be mediated so that you can inhabit</v>

53
00:03:09.791 --> 00:03:13.030
<v Speaker 2>the same territory without subordination or without conflict.</v>

54
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.360
<v Speaker 2>But if you're going to come together and an agreement,</v>

55
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.520
<v Speaker 2>you can't do that simply by abandoning the belief system because the belief</v>

56
00:03:24.521 --> 00:03:26.380
<v Speaker 2>system is what orients you in the world.</v>

57
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.290
<v Speaker 2>And so the negotiation is very tricky and because of that,</v>

58
00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:35.320
<v Speaker 2>it often ends up in subordination or conflict.</v>

59
00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.650
<v Speaker 2>Another question that might arise out of that rat's nest of questions is if you</v>

60
00:03:46.701 --> 00:03:50.840
<v Speaker 2>have belief system a and you have belief system B and they're in conflict,</v>

61
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.820
<v Speaker 2>is there any principles that you can use or any guidelines that you can use to</v>

62
00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.920
<v Speaker 2>take the belief systems apart to under to try to understand what might be of</v>

63
00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.980
<v Speaker 2>central value in either of them or both so that if you do bring them together or</v>

64
00:04:06.351 --> 00:04:08.210
<v Speaker 2>even if one supersedes the other,</v>

65
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.930
<v Speaker 2>that there's some evidence that they're predicated on principles that are</v>

66
00:04:11.931 --> 00:04:12.920
<v Speaker 2>actually viable.</v>

67
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.360
<v Speaker 2>And of course that brings up the question of what constitutes viable principles.</v>

68
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:23.520
<v Speaker 2>And I got interested in that more predicted or question because when the Cold</v>

69
00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.083
<v Speaker 2>War was raging,</v>

70
00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.050
<v Speaker 2>there were two ideological systems set up in the world.</v>

71
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.831
<v Speaker 2>Roughly speaking.</v>

72
00:04:30.831 --> 00:04:31.700
<v Speaker 2>There were of course more,</v>

73
00:04:31.701 --> 00:04:35.990
<v Speaker 2>but we can simplify it for the sake of argument down to two and one was</v>

74
00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.600
<v Speaker 2>predicated on the communitarian principles that were put forward by Marx and the</v>

75
00:04:41.601 --> 00:04:44.570
<v Speaker 2>other was a consequence of,</v>

76
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:45.530
<v Speaker 2>you know the,</v>

77
00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:46.550
<v Speaker 2>I would say western,</v>

78
00:04:46.551 --> 00:04:47.450
<v Speaker 2>individualistic,</v>

79
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.700
<v Speaker 2>free market capitalist democracies,</v>

80
00:04:49.701 --> 00:04:50.600
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking.</v>

81
00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.130
<v Speaker 2>And then you might ask yourself,</v>

82
00:04:52.131 --> 00:04:52.990
<v Speaker 2>well were those only,</v>

83
00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.100
<v Speaker 2>was that only a difference of opinion?</v>

84
00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:56.181
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

85
00:04:56.181 --> 00:04:57.680
<v Speaker 2>because that's the central question.</v>

86
00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:59.540
<v Speaker 2>If it's just a difference of opinion,</v>

87
00:04:59.541 --> 00:05:02.120
<v Speaker 2>if what's underneath it is arbitrary then a,</v>

88
00:05:02.121 --> 00:05:04.970
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter which system wins roughly speaking</v>

89
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.921
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>

90
00:05:06.921 --> 00:05:09.620
<v Speaker 2>there's no right and wrong in the discussion,</v>

91
00:05:09.621 --> 00:05:09.951
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

92
00:05:09.951 --> 00:05:13.700
<v Speaker 2>It's that that would be something that would be more akin to a postmodern claim.</v>

93
00:05:13.701 --> 00:05:17.900
<v Speaker 2>It's just group a puts forward their claims to power and Group B puts form their</v>

94
00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:22.340
<v Speaker 2>claims power and they're both equally valid and while have add are fundamentally</v>

95
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.090
<v Speaker 2>because there's no way of of solving the problem.</v>

96
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.400
<v Speaker 2>But it struck me that that I didn't think that we should leap to that conclusion</v>

97
00:05:31.401 --> 00:05:32.300
<v Speaker 2>so rapidly.</v>

98
00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.790
<v Speaker 2>And so I started to investigate.</v>

99
00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:40.690
<v Speaker 2>I think I started to investigate the substructure of Western thought,</v>

100
00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.530
<v Speaker 2>not so much communist thought because I thought of communism as an interloper on</v>

101
00:05:45.531 --> 00:05:46.220
<v Speaker 2>the scene.</v>

102
00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.630
<v Speaker 2>It was a system that wasn't devised and formalized until the late 19 hundreds</v>

103
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:55.870
<v Speaker 2>late 18 hundreds and I didn't see it as part of what you might describe as</v>

104
00:05:56.031 --> 00:05:57.110
<v Speaker 2>organic development,</v>

105
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.200
<v Speaker 2>no mythologies,</v>

106
00:05:58.201 --> 00:05:58.821
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

107
00:05:58.821 --> 00:05:59.690
<v Speaker 2>at the basis of,</v>

108
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:01.400
<v Speaker 2>of the communist perspective.</v>

109
00:06:01.401 --> 00:06:05.300
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that's very interesting is that although those ideas were</v>

110
00:06:05.301 --> 00:06:07.610
<v Speaker 2>roundly defeated by the end of the 20th century,</v>

111
00:06:07.611 --> 00:06:11.390
<v Speaker 2>they're making a comeback so rapidly that it's almost unbelievable.</v>

112
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.351
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

113
00:06:12.351 --> 00:06:16.460
<v Speaker 2>I got an email from a medical student yesterday at the University of Toronto and</v>

114
00:06:16.461 --> 00:06:19.340
<v Speaker 2>now they're the courses that they have to take the mandatory,</v>

115
00:06:19.341 --> 00:06:24.341
<v Speaker 2>these are social justice courses include modules on equity and equity as</v>

116
00:06:24.381 --> 00:06:25.330
<v Speaker 2>equality of outcome.</v>

117
00:06:25.331 --> 00:06:26.164
<v Speaker 2>It they're pushing.</v>

118
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.340
<v Speaker 2>People are having the equality of outcome notion pushed on them in mandatory</v>

119
00:06:31.341 --> 00:06:33.020
<v Speaker 2>training and universities everywhere.</v>

120
00:06:33.021 --> 00:06:33.351
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

121
00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:35.330
<v Speaker 2>an equity isn't equality of opportunity.</v>

122
00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:36.710
<v Speaker 2>It's equality of outcome.</v>

123
00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:37.551
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

124
00:06:37.551 --> 00:06:41.570
<v Speaker 2>that was the central dictum of the Communist states in the 20th century.</v>

125
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.841
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

126
00:06:41.841 --> 00:06:42.740
<v Speaker 2>what the hell?</v>

127
00:06:42.741 --> 00:06:42.951
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>

128
00:06:42.951 --> 00:06:45.740
<v Speaker 2>how did we get back to that again already?</v>

129
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:47.150
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

130
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:51.410
<v Speaker 2>and the idea being is if there isn't absolute equality of outcome within an</v>

131
00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:52.191
<v Speaker 2>organization,</v>

132
00:06:52.191 --> 00:06:55.430
<v Speaker 2>that the thing is corrupt and needs to be restructured from the bottom up.</v>

133
00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.020
<v Speaker 2>And then the question of course,</v>

134
00:06:57.021 --> 00:07:00.500
<v Speaker 2>is who decides that outcomes are equal by what means?</v>

135
00:07:00.501 --> 00:07:01.490
<v Speaker 2>And with what groups?</v>

136
00:07:01.491 --> 00:07:02.324
<v Speaker 2>Cause you can,</v>

137
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:07.390
<v Speaker 2>you can produce an infinite number of groups of people with equally validly in</v>

138
00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:08.361
<v Speaker 2>some sense.</v>

139
00:07:08.361 --> 00:07:13.040
<v Speaker 2>And you're never going to get equality of outcome across the infinite number of</v>

140
00:07:13.041 --> 00:07:15.710
<v Speaker 2>ways that you can parse up society into groups.</v>

141
00:07:15.711 --> 00:07:18.680
<v Speaker 2>It's not even technically possible unless everyone has nothing.</v>

142
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.080
