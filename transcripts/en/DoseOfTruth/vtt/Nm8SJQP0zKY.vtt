00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.930
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that happens to people all the time in their life is they get</v>

2
00:00:03.931 --> 00:00:06.810
<v Speaker 1>to where they're going and then they don't know what to do,</v>

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:07.171
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4
00:00:07.171 --> 00:00:08.310
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

5
00:00:08.311 --> 00:00:09.780
<v Speaker 1>you graduate from university,</v>

6
00:00:09.781 --> 00:00:10.111
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

7
00:00:10.111 --> 00:00:10.944
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

8
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.600
<v Speaker 1>story over.</v>

9
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.190
<v Speaker 1>Who are you now?</v>

10
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.440
<v Speaker 1>Who are you the next day?</v>

11
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:17.890
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

12
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.770
<v Speaker 1>so what happens is when you succeed,</v>

13
00:00:19.771 --> 00:00:23.580
<v Speaker 1>then there's a success crisis and the success crisis as well.</v>

14
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.910
<v Speaker 1>I've run this story to its end now what?</v>

15
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.150
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly what happens in the Abrahamic stories.</v>

16
00:00:30.151 --> 00:00:34.770
<v Speaker 1>And there are punctuated by a period of contemplation and sacrifice.</v>

17
00:00:34.771 --> 00:00:37.890
<v Speaker 1>So every time an Abrahamic story comes to its end,</v>

18
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.960
<v Speaker 1>then Abraham makes another sacrifice and communes with God,</v>

19
00:00:42.961 --> 00:00:44.520
<v Speaker 1>and then he figures out what to do next.</v>

20
00:00:44.521 --> 00:00:45.354
<v Speaker 1>And that seems,</v>

21
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.620
<v Speaker 1>that seems right.</v>

22
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.720
<v Speaker 1>It seems psychologically right?</v>

23
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.540
<v Speaker 1>Because what you should do when your story comes to an end,</v>

24
00:00:51.541 --> 00:00:53.640
<v Speaker 1>when you've achieved what it is that you want to achieve,</v>

25
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.130
<v Speaker 1>or perhaps when you're in terribly dire straights,</v>

26
00:00:56.131 --> 00:00:58.020
<v Speaker 1>but we won't talk about that at the moment.</v>

27
00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.880
<v Speaker 1>When you've achieved what you need to achieve.</v>

28
00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:00.780
<v Speaker 1>Then the next question is,</v>

29
00:01:00.781 --> 00:01:01.081
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

30
00:01:01.081 --> 00:01:03.450
<v Speaker 1>well now I'm that person,</v>

31
00:01:03.451 --> 00:01:04.650
<v Speaker 1>or I have that character.</v>

32
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:05.813
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

33
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.740
<v Speaker 1>What do I need to do next?</v>

34
00:01:07.741 --> 00:01:08.700
<v Speaker 1>And some of that is always,</v>

35
00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:08.821
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

36
00:01:08.821 --> 00:01:10.230
<v Speaker 1>what do I need to give up now?</v>

37
00:01:10.231 --> 00:01:13.170
<v Speaker 1>What do I need to let go of so I can move to the next plateau?</v>

38
00:01:13.171 --> 00:01:13.381
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

39
00:01:13.381 --> 00:01:14.520
<v Speaker 1>As soon as your life as a,</v>

40
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:15.653
<v Speaker 1>hopefully a,</v>

41
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.910
<v Speaker 1>a sequence of upward moving,</v>

42
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.553
<v Speaker 1>what would you call them?</v>

43
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like scissor office.</v>

44
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:21.720
<v Speaker 1>Except you're actually,</v>

45
00:01:21.721 --> 00:01:23.310
<v Speaker 1>each time you climb up the mountain,</v>

46
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.040
<v Speaker 1>you get a little higher on the mountain at something like that.</v>

47
00:01:26.041 --> 00:01:28.940
<v Speaker 1>So it says office with an optimistic bent and,</v>

48
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:30.000
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

49
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.480
<v Speaker 1>and maybe if you push the rock up the mountain properly and let it roll down</v>

50
00:01:33.481 --> 00:01:34.314
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

51
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.220
<v Speaker 1>And if you do that right,</v>

52
00:01:35.221 --> 00:01:35.911
<v Speaker 1>then it's okay.</v>

53
00:01:35.911 --> 00:01:37.110
<v Speaker 1>Every time you roll it back up,</v>

54
00:01:37.111 --> 00:01:37.550
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

55
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.150
<v Speaker 1>it's better in some sense.</v>

56
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.220
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think that's unrealistic either.</v>

57
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:42.683
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

58
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.400
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
