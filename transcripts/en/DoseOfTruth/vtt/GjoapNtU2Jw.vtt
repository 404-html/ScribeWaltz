1
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.540
<v Speaker 1>We know that if you're caught up in one of these little world games that you may</v>

2
00:00:11.581 --> 00:00:13.020
<v Speaker 1>be motivated by something very,</v>

3
00:00:13.021 --> 00:00:14.100
<v Speaker 1>very fundamental,</v>

4
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:14.470
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

5
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.440
<v Speaker 1>a tendency that transcends you,</v>

6
00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:18.870
<v Speaker 1>the tendency to propagate yourself,</v>

7
00:00:18.871 --> 00:00:23.871
<v Speaker 1>say Freud's fundamental motivational level sexual affiliation or the tendency to</v>

8
00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:25.230
<v Speaker 1>maintain yourself.</v>

9
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.460
<v Speaker 1>Those you could say are the fundamental gods of existence,</v>

10
00:00:29.461 --> 00:00:31.980
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental driving force.</v>

11
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.761
<v Speaker 1>And it's there.</v>

12
00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:36.090
<v Speaker 1>It's the interaction of those two forces over great periods of time that</v>

13
00:00:36.091 --> 00:00:40.140
<v Speaker 1>produced the great diversity of life and human life that we see before us.</v>

14
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.240
<v Speaker 1>And each of those fundamental,</v>

15
00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:44.340
<v Speaker 1>most fundamental of gods have their</v>

16
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.240
<v Speaker 1>differentiated many and so to speak.</v>

17
00:00:48.241 --> 00:00:52.200
<v Speaker 1>So that well engaged in the Matt had goal of self preservation.</v>

18
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.320
<v Speaker 1>You Act out plots of hunger and plots of thirst and he moved from cold to hot or</v>

19
00:00:58.381 --> 00:01:00.660
<v Speaker 1>from hot to cold depending on your particular,</v>

20
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.873
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.330
<v Speaker 1>on your particular,</v>

22
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.470
<v Speaker 1>on the particular temperature of your surroundings or with regards to self</v>

23
00:01:07.471 --> 00:01:08.400
<v Speaker 1>propagation.</v>

24
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.700
<v Speaker 1>You're attracted to people who are repelled by them for reasons that are</v>

25
00:01:11.701 --> 00:01:14.310
<v Speaker 1>frequently absolutely beyond your comprehension,</v>

26
00:01:14.311 --> 00:01:14.701
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

27
00:01:14.701 --> 00:01:16.380
<v Speaker 1>So I just found out this week,</v>

28
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.120
<v Speaker 1>and this is absolutely staggering.</v>

29
00:01:18.121 --> 00:01:19.440
<v Speaker 1>I think that if you,</v>

30
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.573
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

31
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.630
<v Speaker 1>if you run an experiment on a group of women and you track their menstrual cycle</v>

32
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.560
<v Speaker 1>and then you give them t shirts that men have worn to smell,</v>

33
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.790
<v Speaker 1>that women who are ovulating like the smell of symmetrical men better than</v>

34
00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:33.880
<v Speaker 1>asymmetrical man.</v>

35
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.591
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

36
00:01:34.591 --> 00:01:37.620
<v Speaker 1>and that's partly because symmetrical men are probably more healthy,</v>

37
00:01:37.621 --> 00:01:42.621
<v Speaker 1>but this is a good example of how the motive forces that configure your world</v>

38
00:01:43.261 --> 00:01:46.920
<v Speaker 1>are dependent on instinctual forces that are not only beyond your consciousness,</v>

39
00:01:46.921 --> 00:01:51.921
<v Speaker 1>but they're beyond even at the moment any of our explicit explanations.</v>

40
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.001
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

41
00:01:57.001 --> 00:01:57.211
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:01:57.211 --> 00:02:01.140
<v Speaker 1>another finding that's very similar that I came across recently,</v>

43
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.500
<v Speaker 1>it turns out that mice will not mate with mice that have rh blood factors that</v>

44
00:02:06.841 --> 00:02:08.100
<v Speaker 1>are likely to produce,</v>

45
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.263
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

46
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.550
<v Speaker 1>unfit offspring.</v>

47
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.630
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

48
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.600
<v Speaker 1>the more closely genetically related the RH factors,</v>

49
00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:17.050
<v Speaker 1>the more likely there is to be a,</v>

50
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

51
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

52
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.190
<v Speaker 1>a catastrophe with regards to offspring.</v>

53
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.660
<v Speaker 1>And the mice seem to detect the RH factor by smells.</v>

54
00:02:23.661 --> 00:02:27.960
<v Speaker 1>So recently this was run by with women and it is also the case that women prefer</v>

55
00:02:27.961 --> 00:02:30.780
<v Speaker 1>man who's rh factors are at an optimal distance from them.</v>

56
00:02:30.781 --> 00:02:31.680
<v Speaker 1>In terms of smell.</v>

57
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.490
<v Speaker 1>So this is some example of how these unbelievably archaic systems,</v>

58
00:02:35.491 --> 00:02:38.340
<v Speaker 1>cause like the olfactory systems are unbelievably archaic,</v>

59
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.820
<v Speaker 1>produce alterations in Worldview at a level that's massively below</v>

60
00:02:45.811 --> 00:02:46.800
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

61
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.270
<v Speaker 1>So underneath your cortical shell,</v>

62
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.410
<v Speaker 1>which is tonically inhibiting all your emotional and motivational systems,</v>

63
00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.680
<v Speaker 1>lies all these motivational and emotional systems and they have branches that</v>

64
00:02:59.681 --> 00:03:03.370
<v Speaker 1>grow up into the cortex and they have the capacity to control your behavior</v>

65
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.890
<v Speaker 1>completely involuntary.</v>

66
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.791
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

67
00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:07.900
<v Speaker 1>if you're gripped by fear,</v>

68
00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:08.830
<v Speaker 1>if you're gripped by fear,</v>

69
00:03:08.831 --> 00:03:09.311
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

70
00:03:09.311 --> 00:03:11.290
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to overcome that voluntarily.</v>

71
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.450
<v Speaker 1>And at least initially you won't be able to,</v>

72
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.580
<v Speaker 1>which is to say that when the chips are down,</v>

73
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.810
<v Speaker 1>the underlying motivational and emotional systems have control.</v>

74
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.950
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

75
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.220
<v Speaker 1>so then what happens from that perspective then what happens when you encounter</v>

76
00:03:24.221 --> 00:03:25.420
<v Speaker 1>something you don't understand?</v>

77
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.440
<v Speaker 1>And I think the best way to explain it is something like generalized</v>

78
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.400
<v Speaker 1>disinhibition,</v>

79
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.020
<v Speaker 1>which is that all your underlying motivational and emotional systems are more or</v>

80
00:03:35.021 --> 00:03:36.640
<v Speaker 1>less disinhibited simile.</v>

81
00:03:36.641 --> 00:03:37.240
<v Speaker 1>Tanium.</v>

82
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.450
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is because you want to be maximally prepared to do</v>

83
00:03:40.451 --> 00:03:43.420
<v Speaker 1>whatever the hell is necessary to do when you're somewhere that you don't</v>

84
00:03:43.421 --> 00:03:44.254
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

85
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.990
<v Speaker 1>And because you don't know what that thing is going to be,</v>

86
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.580
<v Speaker 1>all your systems go on.</v>

87
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.980
<v Speaker 1>And when psychologists talk about stress,</v>

88
00:03:50.981 --> 00:03:52.810
<v Speaker 1>which is an abysmal word,</v>

89
00:03:52.811 --> 00:03:53.051
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

90
00:03:53.051 --> 00:03:54.460
<v Speaker 1>It means everything and nothing.</v>

91
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.290
<v Speaker 1>When psychologists talk about stress,</v>

92
00:03:56.291 --> 00:03:59.170
<v Speaker 1>what they mean is generalized disinhibition.</v>
