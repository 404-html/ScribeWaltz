<v Speaker 1>ditch your barber barber quite a bit.</v>

3
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.160
<v Speaker 1>They hit his haircuts a little shorter than I'm accustomed to and there's some</v>

4
00:00:17.161 --> 00:00:18.030
<v Speaker 1>reasons for that.</v>

5
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.893
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

6
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:20.643
