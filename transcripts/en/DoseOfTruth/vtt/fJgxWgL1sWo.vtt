1
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:06.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2
00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:07.300
<v Speaker 1>the other,</v>

3
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.650
<v Speaker 1>the other element is very important to this is music is the voice of a</v>

4
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:11.563
<v Speaker 1>subculture.</v>

5
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.310
<v Speaker 1>So when you tell 100 million kids who filled out early,</v>

6
00:00:14.311 --> 00:00:15.630
<v Speaker 1>isolated and alone,</v>

7
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.201
<v Speaker 1>that they,</v>

8
00:00:16.201 --> 00:00:19.440
<v Speaker 1>that their experiences had not been reflected in the experience of any other</v>

9
00:00:19.441 --> 00:00:20.274
<v Speaker 1>person on earth,</v>

10
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.780
<v Speaker 1>that in fact they are not alone.</v>

11
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:22.680
<v Speaker 1>Layer a movement.</v>

12
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.080
<v Speaker 1>You give a subculture,</v>

13
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.420
<v Speaker 1>a boys and you can see that with,</v>

14
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.791
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

15
00:00:27.791 --> 00:00:30.000
<v Speaker 1>when I finally got into working with music,</v>

16
00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:33.450
<v Speaker 1>one of the first things I did was work with country and western music.</v>

17
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.583
<v Speaker 1>Now George,</v>

18
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.481
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

19
00:00:35.481 --> 00:00:37.520
<v Speaker 1>I worked with a company called doc records.</v>

20
00:00:37.521 --> 00:00:41.660
<v Speaker 1>I was hired by a Gulf and western to found a public and artist's relations</v>

21
00:00:41.661 --> 00:00:43.640
<v Speaker 1>department for their 14 record companies.</v>

22
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.790
<v Speaker 1>And one of those companies was not records and dot.</v>

23
00:00:46.791 --> 00:00:51.560
<v Speaker 1>Records was number three on the country charts and that it was with third place</v>

24
00:00:51.561 --> 00:00:53.960
<v Speaker 1>company and they wanted to be number one,</v>

25
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:54.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

26
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.220
<v Speaker 1>in country and western music.</v>

27
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.660
<v Speaker 1>Now when I was a child,</v>

28
00:00:57.661 --> 00:00:59.550
<v Speaker 1>when I was about three and a half years old,</v>

29
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.080
<v Speaker 1>I woke up on a Sunday before anybody else in the house had woken up,</v>

30
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.510
<v Speaker 1>went out to the front room where there was sunlight,</v>

31
00:01:06.511 --> 00:01:10.420
<v Speaker 1>which I didn't get to see as often as I'd like and turned on the radio and</v>

32
00:01:10.421 --> 00:01:13.150
<v Speaker 1>because it was six o'clock in the morning or something like that,</v>

33
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.900
<v Speaker 1>what I got were farm reports and country and Western music.</v>

34
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.580
<v Speaker 1>This was in 19 1946 or something like that,</v>

35
00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:25.420
<v Speaker 1>or 1947 and I immediately knew</v>

36
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.620
<v Speaker 1>that that music was alien to me and I knew that it was the music of another</v>

37
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.390
<v Speaker 1>subculture would not necessarily be kind to the subculture from which I came.</v>

38
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.470
<v Speaker 1>So I never liked country music</v>

39
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.510
<v Speaker 1>in the 1970s when I got this position with Gulf and western,</v>

40
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.190
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I crusaded for the hardest was country and western music</v>

41
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.000
<v Speaker 1>because I felt that these people had a right to express their identity.</v>

42
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.810
<v Speaker 1>I felt they had a right to get beyond the ghetto of the Bible belt,</v>

43
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.370
<v Speaker 1>which is where they were kept.</v>

44
00:01:56.371 --> 00:01:57.630
<v Speaker 1>And where are they were suppressed.</v>

45
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.930
<v Speaker 1>It was an era of subculture is finding themselves and expressing their right to</v>

46
00:02:03.321 --> 00:02:04.154
<v Speaker 1>exist.</v>

47
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.053
<v Speaker 1>It started</v>

48
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.030
<v Speaker 2>music really does seem to have that binding capacity.</v>

49
00:02:08.031 --> 00:02:08.660
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

50
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.660
<v Speaker 2>I think there's also something neurological about that because to tell me what</v>

51
00:02:13.911 --> 00:02:14.750
<v Speaker 2>you think about this,</v>

52
00:02:14.751 --> 00:02:16.760
<v Speaker 2>if this is in accordance with your observations,</v>

53
00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:21.761
<v Speaker 2>but it seems to me that the music that people listen to as their catalyzing</v>

54
00:02:22.131 --> 00:02:23.150
<v Speaker 2>their adult identity,</v>

55
00:02:23.151 --> 00:02:26.390
<v Speaker 2>say between the ages of about 14,</v>

56
00:02:26.391 --> 00:02:27.740
<v Speaker 2>15 to 20,</v>

57
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:28.221
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

58
00:02:28.221 --> 00:02:28.680
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

59
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.121
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

60
00:02:29.121 --> 00:02:30.410
<v Speaker 2>there's a real intense</v>

61
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.863
<v Speaker 1>mmm</v>

62
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.040
<v Speaker 2>period of neural pruning that occurs at the end of adolescence.</v>

63
00:02:35.041 --> 00:02:38.680
<v Speaker 2>So you'll get none this amount of neural neural pruning after,</v>

64
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

65
00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.680
<v Speaker 2>after you're born in the early stages of infancy,</v>

66
00:02:41.681 --> 00:02:44.170
<v Speaker 2>cause you have a lot of neural connections and then a lot of them,</v>

67
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.860
<v Speaker 2>you kind of dye into your childhood self,</v>

68
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:47.080
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

69
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.300
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

70
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.970
<v Speaker 2>you're born with twice as many neurons as you will actually need.</v>

71
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.530
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

72
00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.781
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

73
00:02:50.781 --> 00:02:51.321
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

74
00:02:51.321 --> 00:02:51.651
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

75
00:02:51.651 --> 00:02:52.431
<v Speaker 2>so you're,</v>

76
00:02:52.431 --> 00:02:53.990
<v Speaker 2>you're a mass of possibility.</v>

77
00:02:53.991 --> 00:02:55.850
<v Speaker 2>And then you dye into your actuality.</v>

78
00:02:55.851 --> 00:02:57.980
<v Speaker 2>And then that happens again in late adolescence,</v>

79
00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.230
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

80
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.110
<v Speaker 2>Which is also in schizophrenia develops because that process seems to go wrong</v>

81
00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:02.801
<v Speaker 2>for some people.</v>

82
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:05.740
<v Speaker 2>But as you're diving into that adult identity,</v>

83
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.240
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that seems to catalyze that is the music of your culture at</v>

84
00:03:10.241 --> 00:03:10.781
<v Speaker 2>that time.</v>

85
00:03:10.781 --> 00:03:15.640
<v Speaker 2>And that also seems to unite you in some way underneath rational thought with</v>

86
00:03:15.641 --> 00:03:17.790
<v Speaker 2>the people of your generation,</v>

87
00:03:17.791 --> 00:03:20.580
<v Speaker 2>let's say with the people you'd have to cooperate with and compete with.</v>

88
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.920
<v Speaker 2>And so there's something really deep about that too.</v>

89
00:03:22.921 --> 00:03:24.420
<v Speaker 2>That's not well understood.</v>

90
00:03:24.421 --> 00:03:24.980
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

91
00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:25.813
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

92
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:26.840
<v Speaker 2>and so</v>

93
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.560
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

94
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.801
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

95
00:03:27.801 --> 00:03:31.520
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know what you think about the second element of that because it's a</v>

96
00:03:31.521 --> 00:03:32.540
<v Speaker 1>brilliant observation.</v>

97
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.900
<v Speaker 1>And then the second element of that is that in your late teens,</v>

98
00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.240
<v Speaker 1>your prefrontal cortex gets wired up.</v>

99
00:03:38.241 --> 00:03:39.830
<v Speaker 1>Now what's the pre frontal cortex?</v>

100
00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.730
<v Speaker 1>It's pro.</v>

101
00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.230
<v Speaker 1>We talk about it as the,</v>

102
00:03:42.231 --> 00:03:45.590
<v Speaker 1>the center of Administration in the brain executive functions.</v>

103
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.620
<v Speaker 1>It's primary job is making you human.</v>

104
00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.341
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

105
00:03:49.341 --> 00:03:52.640
<v Speaker 1>You would think that means encouraging certain things like creativity and</v>

106
00:03:52.641 --> 00:03:53.390
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>

107
00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:54.180
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

108
00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.420
<v Speaker 1>the job of the prefrontal cortex and making you human</v>

109
00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:58.563
<v Speaker 2>is</v>

110
00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.073
<v Speaker 1>press things.</v>

111
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

112
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.010
<v Speaker 1>it's too damp things down.</v>

113
00:04:03.011 --> 00:04:08.011
<v Speaker 1>It's to inhibit things and you are learning which things to inhibit after you</v>

114
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.980
<v Speaker 1>become utterly grafted into your subculture.</v>

115
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.700
<v Speaker 1>And what is one of the elements that has grafted you when do your subculture</v>

116
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.863
<v Speaker 1>music?</v>

117
00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.160
<v Speaker 1>And so what Freud would call the Super Ego is formed to a certain extent based</v>

118
00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:23.420
<v Speaker 1>on your subculture,</v>

119
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.130
<v Speaker 1>where connections that you've developed as a team and again use it helps</v>

120
00:04:27.131 --> 00:04:30.070
<v Speaker 1>identify that subculture of which you feel apart.</v>

121
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.650
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

122
00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.801
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

123
00:04:30.801 --> 00:04:31.021
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

124
00:04:31.021 --> 00:04:31.221
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

125
00:04:31.221 --> 00:04:35.790
<v Speaker 2>so partly what's happening there is that because music is poetic and also it's</v>

126
00:04:35.791 --> 00:04:36.840
<v Speaker 2>poetic and emotional,</v>

127
00:04:36.841 --> 00:04:37.674
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

128
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.470
<v Speaker 2>it also constitutes the,</v>

129
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.520
<v Speaker 2>the pre rational substrate from which the values of that subculture emerge.</v>

130
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:46.563
<v Speaker 2>So it's like the,</v>

131
00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.930
<v Speaker 2>it's part of the mythological substructure of the values of that culture.</v>

132
00:04:49.931 --> 00:04:51.490
<v Speaker 2>And you can make absolute sense.</v>

133
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

134
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.971
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

135
00:04:51.971 --> 00:04:53.920
<v Speaker 2>You can see that expressed in the lyrics in,</v>

136
00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.520
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

137
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.110
<v Speaker 2>And where,</v>

138
00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.820
<v Speaker 2>which lay out a system of values in some sense.</v>

139
00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:58.610
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

140
00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.400
<v Speaker 2>Something like hip hop for example.</v>
