1
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.370
<v Speaker 1>So they bow down to Joseph and properly.</v>

2
00:00:08.371 --> 00:00:09.810
<v Speaker 1>So you know he's,</v>

3
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.060
<v Speaker 1>he is even without his coat,</v>

4
00:00:12.061 --> 00:00:14.850
<v Speaker 1>he's still the person with the coat of many colors.</v>

5
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.830
<v Speaker 1>And Joseph saw his brothers and he knew them,</v>

6
00:00:16.831 --> 00:00:20.490
<v Speaker 1>but he made themselves strange and to them it's a number of years have passed</v>

7
00:00:20.491 --> 00:00:22.530
<v Speaker 1>and he spoke roughly unto them and he sat down with them,</v>

8
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:23.700
<v Speaker 1>where do you come from?</v>

9
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.790
<v Speaker 1>And they said from the land of Canaan to buy food.</v>

10
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.950
<v Speaker 1>And Joseph knew whose brothers were,</v>

11
00:00:28.951 --> 00:00:30.300
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't know who he was.</v>

12
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.670
<v Speaker 1>And they came back to Jacob their father and told him all that be fail them and</v>

13
00:00:37.671 --> 00:00:38.300
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

14
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.750
<v Speaker 1>the man who is lord of the country spoke roughly to us and took us for spies.</v>

15
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.183
<v Speaker 1>And we said to him,</v>

16
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.940
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

17
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.470
<v Speaker 1>we're true man.</v>

18
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.390
<v Speaker 1>Honest man were not spies.</v>

19
00:00:47.391 --> 00:00:49.340
<v Speaker 1>We be 12 brothers sons of our fathers,</v>

20
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:50.690
<v Speaker 1>one is not.</v>

21
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.440
<v Speaker 1>And the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.</v>

22
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.710
<v Speaker 1>And the man said,</v>

23
00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.870
<v Speaker 1>here's how I'll know that you're honest man.</v>

24
00:00:59.871 --> 00:01:03.830
<v Speaker 1>Leave one of the brothers here with me and take some food for the famine of your</v>

25
00:01:03.831 --> 00:01:05.000
<v Speaker 1>households and be gone,</v>

26
00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:07.160
<v Speaker 1>and then bring your youngest brother to me,</v>

27
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.100
<v Speaker 1>then I'll know that you're not spies,</v>

28
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.150
<v Speaker 1>but that you're honest man,</v>

29
00:01:11.151 --> 00:01:15.530
<v Speaker 1>and I'll deliver the other brother and you shale trade in the lounge so you</v>

30
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:16.970
<v Speaker 1>don't have to starve to death.</v>

31
00:01:16.971 --> 00:01:19.400
<v Speaker 1>And it came to pass as they empty their sacks,</v>

32
00:01:19.401 --> 00:01:22.640
<v Speaker 1>that behold every man's bundle of money was in his sock.</v>

33
00:01:22.641 --> 00:01:25.370
<v Speaker 1>And when both they and their father saw the bundles of money,</v>

34
00:01:25.371 --> 00:01:26.061
<v Speaker 1>they were afraid.</v>

35
00:01:26.061 --> 00:01:30.440
<v Speaker 1>So they had bought food from Joseph and he gave them the food and then he put</v>

36
00:01:30.441 --> 00:01:32.480
<v Speaker 1>all their money back and their socks,</v>

37
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.360
<v Speaker 1>which I could imagine would worry them to some degree.</v>

38
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.070
<v Speaker 1>And Jacob said,</v>

39
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:38.181
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

40
00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:39.890
<v Speaker 1>you've already bereaved of my children.</v>

41
00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:41.300
<v Speaker 1>Joseph is not as Seminis.</v>

42
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.841
<v Speaker 1>Not now.</v>

43
00:01:41.841 --> 00:01:43.880
<v Speaker 1>You'll take Benjamin Benjamin away.</v>

44
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.590
<v Speaker 1>All these things are against me.</v>

45
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.750
<v Speaker 1>And Ruben spake unto his father,</v>

46
00:01:47.751 --> 00:01:48.081
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

47
00:01:48.081 --> 00:01:49.130
<v Speaker 1>slay my two sons.</v>

48
00:01:49.131 --> 00:01:52.520
<v Speaker 1>If I bring him not to the deliver him into my hand and I will bring him to the</v>

49
00:01:52.521 --> 00:01:53.354
<v Speaker 1>again</v>

50
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:55.830
<v Speaker 1>and he and he said,</v>

51
00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:56.100
<v Speaker 1>nope,</v>

52
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.640
<v Speaker 1>my son shall not go down with you for his brother is dead and he's left alone.</v>

53
00:01:59.641 --> 00:02:00.780
<v Speaker 1>If mischief befall him,</v>

54
00:02:00.781 --> 00:02:01.614
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

55
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.520
<v Speaker 1>in the which you shall go,</v>

56
00:02:03.521 --> 00:02:06.730
<v Speaker 1>then you shall bring down my gray gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.</v>

57
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.370
<v Speaker 1>Now there's a hand,</v>

58
00:02:09.371 --> 00:02:11.890
<v Speaker 1>see what happens in the last part of the Jacobs stores.</v>

59
00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.210
<v Speaker 1>The Joseph story is,</v>

60
00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.140
<v Speaker 1>and this is associated with the idea of putting your house in,</v>

61
00:02:17.141 --> 00:02:17.381
<v Speaker 1>order,</v>

62
00:02:17.381 --> 00:02:18.610
<v Speaker 1>your individual house in order,</v>

63
00:02:18.611 --> 00:02:20.350
<v Speaker 1>and then putting your family's house in order.</v>

64
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.370
<v Speaker 1>Let's say it's reversed a little bit in this story because Joseph puts himself</v>

65
00:02:24.371 --> 00:02:28.360
<v Speaker 1>together and then he puts the state of Egypt in order,</v>

66
00:02:28.361 --> 00:02:31.900
<v Speaker 1>which is really quite interesting because Egypt is the canonical tyranny right</v>

67
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.220
<v Speaker 1>in the old testament.</v>

68
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.410
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea is very,</v>

69
00:02:35.411 --> 00:02:39.430
<v Speaker 1>very clear here that the person who wears the coat of many colors can put the</v>

70
00:02:39.431 --> 00:02:40.300
<v Speaker 1>tyranny right?</v>

71
00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.550
<v Speaker 1>And then the next extension is,</v>

72
00:02:42.551 --> 00:02:44.410
<v Speaker 1>well he has to put his family right now.</v>

73
00:02:44.411 --> 00:02:44.711
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

74
00:02:44.711 --> 00:02:48.010
<v Speaker 1>generally the progression would be put yourself right then put your family right</v>

75
00:02:48.011 --> 00:02:49.000
<v Speaker 1>then put the state right,</v>

76
00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:49.834
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

77
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:50.813
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't really,</v>

78
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.240
<v Speaker 1>if you could do it in a different order,</v>

79
00:02:52.241 --> 00:02:53.500
<v Speaker 1>that's probably okay too.</v>

80
00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.570
<v Speaker 1>But so,</v>

81
00:02:55.571 --> 00:02:57.760
<v Speaker 1>so that's what happens at the end of the story is that,</v>

82
00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.073
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

83
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.640
<v Speaker 1>Joseph is doing pretty damn well and so is the state that he serves.</v>

84
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.320
<v Speaker 1>But that isn't good enough for him.</v>

85
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.650
<v Speaker 1>He wants his family to be functional and put together properly even though they</v>

86
00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:13.150
<v Speaker 1>did terrible things to him.</v>

87
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.310
<v Speaker 1>And that's very interesting because once someone does terrible things to you,</v>

88
00:03:18.311 --> 00:03:22.830
<v Speaker 1>then the logical thing or a logical thing to think is well go to hell in a hand</v>

89
00:03:22.831 --> 00:03:23.321
<v Speaker 1>basket.</v>

90
00:03:23.321 --> 00:03:23.770
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

91
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:24.550
<v Speaker 1>like you,</v>

92
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.170
<v Speaker 1>you deserve exactly what you get,</v>

93
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:27.483
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

94
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.470
<v Speaker 1>it's not a very productive attitude,</v>

95
00:03:32.471 --> 00:03:35.770
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're around people that you have to be around.</v>

96
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.090
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

97
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.090
<v Speaker 1>So like if it's your family and you go have a family dinner and one of you</v>

98
00:03:42.281 --> 00:03:44.290
<v Speaker 1>punches the other and then the other punches you back.</v>

99
00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:46.900
<v Speaker 1>And then that's like the family dinner for the next 30 years.</v>

100
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.030
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem to be very productive.</v>

101
00:03:49.031 --> 00:03:52.420
<v Speaker 1>Even if you're the person who happened to get in the last blow because you're</v>

102
00:03:52.421 --> 00:03:54.940
<v Speaker 1>going to have to put up with them at minimum.</v>

103
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.380
<v Speaker 1>It might be nice to just let what you can go,</v>

104
00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.960
<v Speaker 1>go and work to make towards making things better.</v>

105
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.950
<v Speaker 1>You have to get rid of the idea of revenge and resentment and all those things</v>

106
00:04:05.951 --> 00:04:06.761
<v Speaker 1>that you carry along.</v>

107
00:04:06.761 --> 00:04:07.594
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

108
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.010
<v Speaker 1>but it's probably better to think about how your family could be if it was</v>

109
00:04:15.011 --> 00:04:16.660
<v Speaker 1>really functioning well.</v>

110
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:19.060
<v Speaker 1>And then just to aim unerringly of that.</v>

111
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.691
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

112
00:04:19.691 --> 00:04:19.811
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

113
00:04:19.811 --> 00:04:20.561
<v Speaker 1>that's not easy.</v>

114
00:04:20.561 --> 00:04:21.394
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

115
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:22.860
<v Speaker 1>people are very screw in.</v>

116
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.090
<v Speaker 1>There's no end to the depths of pathology within families.</v>

117
00:04:28.091 --> 00:04:31.360
<v Speaker 1>But of course this story states that very clearly,</v>

118
00:04:31.361 --> 00:04:32.194
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

119
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.640
<v Speaker 1>they tried to kill him,</v>

120
00:04:33.641 --> 00:04:35.290
<v Speaker 1>they sold him into slavery.</v>

121
00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:36.124
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

122
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.660
<v Speaker 1>it's a pathological family,</v>

123
00:04:37.661 --> 00:04:38.650
<v Speaker 1>let's put it that way.</v>

124
00:04:38.651 --> 00:04:39.100
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

125
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.170
<v Speaker 1>but Joseph's attitude is,</v>

126
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.701
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

127
00:04:42.701 --> 00:04:46.210
<v Speaker 1>we got to set this right not least because of his father,</v>

128
00:04:46.211 --> 00:04:47.800
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't only because of his father,</v>

129
00:04:47.801 --> 00:04:48.610
<v Speaker 1>as you see,</v>

130
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:49.810
<v Speaker 1>as the story unfolds.</v>

131
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.720
<v Speaker 1>And the famine was sore in the land and it came to pass.</v>

132
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.150
<v Speaker 1>When they had eaten up the corn,</v>

133
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.360
<v Speaker 1>which they had brought out of Egypt,</v>

134
00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:56.500
<v Speaker 1>their father said unto them,</v>

135
00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.660
<v Speaker 1>go again and bias a little food.</v>

136
00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.790
<v Speaker 1>And Judo spake unto him,</v>

137
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:01.743
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

138
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.390
<v Speaker 1>the man did solemnly protest unto us.</v>

139
00:05:04.391 --> 00:05:04.980
<v Speaker 1>You not see.</v>

140
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.330
<v Speaker 1>You will not see my face except your brother be with you.</v>

141
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.160
<v Speaker 1>They cannot go back to Egypt without Benjamin.</v>

142
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:11.703
<v Speaker 1>And they said,</v>

143
00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.400
<v Speaker 1>the man asked his straightly of our state and other kindred saying,</v>

144
00:05:15.401 --> 00:05:16.540
<v Speaker 1>is your father yet alive?</v>

145
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.710
<v Speaker 1>Have you another brother?</v>

146
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.380
<v Speaker 1>And we told them according to the tenor of those words,</v>

147
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.720
<v Speaker 1>could we know that he would say,</v>

148
00:05:22.721 --> 00:05:24.010
<v Speaker 1>bring your brother down.</v>

149
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.080
<v Speaker 1>And Judas said unto Israel,</v>

150
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.661
<v Speaker 1>his father,</v>

151
00:05:26.661 --> 00:05:30.220
<v Speaker 1>send the lab with me and will arise and go that we may live and not die.</v>

152
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.260
<v Speaker 1>Both we and vow and also our little ones,</v>

153
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.060
<v Speaker 1>I will be sure it he for him,</v>

154
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:35.920
<v Speaker 1>my hand shell,</v>

155
00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.510
<v Speaker 1>they'll require him if I bring him,</v>

156
00:05:37.511 --> 00:05:39.660
<v Speaker 1>not under the inset them before the Len.</v>

157
00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.320
<v Speaker 1>Let me bear the blame forever.</v>

158
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.931
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

159
00:05:43.931 --> 00:05:48.931
<v Speaker 1>So Judah who played a pretty dismal role in the original selling Joseph into</v>

160
00:05:49.961 --> 00:05:54.460
<v Speaker 1>slavery seems to obviously have learned something by this point since he's</v>

161
00:05:54.461 --> 00:05:56.650
<v Speaker 1>willing to put himself on the line,</v>

162
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:57.171
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

163
00:05:57.171 --> 00:06:00.840
<v Speaker 1>to take responsibility for the situation and to put himself on the line and to</v>

164
00:06:00.841 --> 00:06:02.540
<v Speaker 1>stand in for Benjamin.</v>

165
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.080
<v Speaker 1>So he's making himself into a sacrificial object of sorts.</v>

166
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:07.243
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

167
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.560
<v Speaker 1>the game that Joseph's playing,</v>

168
00:06:12.561 --> 00:06:14.300
<v Speaker 1>because he sort of teasing his brothers,</v>

169
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:15.860
<v Speaker 1>but he's also testing them,</v>

170
00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:17.330
<v Speaker 1>the game that he's playing is twofold.</v>

171
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.200
<v Speaker 1>It's one is have you bloody well learned anything or are you just as corrupt and</v>

172
00:06:21.201 --> 00:06:22.640
<v Speaker 1>useless as you were before?</v>

173
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:23.750
<v Speaker 1>That's game number one.</v>

174
00:06:23.751 --> 00:06:27.590
<v Speaker 1>Then game number two is maybe if I poke and prod you and put you into a</v>

175
00:06:27.591 --> 00:06:30.140
<v Speaker 1>relatively difficult and mysterious situation,</v>

176
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.460
<v Speaker 1>I can get you to clue the hell in and the dog some responsibility and we can</v>

177
00:06:34.461 --> 00:06:35.930
<v Speaker 1>move this whole mess forward.</v>

178
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:37.880
<v Speaker 1>And so that seems to be happening.</v>

179
00:06:37.881 --> 00:06:40.940
<v Speaker 1>So Judah is taking responsibility.</v>

180
00:06:40.941 --> 00:06:44.060
<v Speaker 1>And Ruben did that as well and the men took presence and they took double money</v>

181
00:06:44.061 --> 00:06:47.810
<v Speaker 1>in their hand and Benjamin and rose up and went down to Egypt and stood before</v>

182
00:06:47.811 --> 00:06:48.644
<v Speaker 1>Joseph.</v>

183
00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:50.750
<v Speaker 1>When Joseph saw Benjamin with them,</v>

184
00:06:50.751 --> 00:06:52.250
<v Speaker 1>he said to the ruler of his house,</v>

185
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:57.260
<v Speaker 1>bring these men home and slay and make ready food for these men shall dine with</v>

186
00:06:57.261 --> 00:06:57.830
<v Speaker 1>me at noon.</v>

187
00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.580
<v Speaker 1>And the men mandate is Joseph Bade in the man brought them in into Joseph's</v>

188
00:07:01.581 --> 00:07:02.414
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

189
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.310
<v Speaker 1>And when Joseph came home,</v>

190
00:07:04.311 --> 00:07:07.640
<v Speaker 1>they brought him the presence which was in their hand and bowed themselves again</v>

191
00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:09.463
<v Speaker 1>to him,</v>

192
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.333
<v Speaker 1>to the earth.</v>

193
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.650
<v Speaker 1>And he asked them if their welfare and said,</v>

194
00:07:12.651 --> 00:07:13.281
<v Speaker 1>is your father?</v>

195
00:07:13.281 --> 00:07:13.611
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

196
00:07:13.611 --> 00:07:17.360
<v Speaker 1>the old man of whom you speak is whom he spake as he yet alive.</v>

197
00:07:17.361 --> 00:07:19.400
<v Speaker 1>And they answered thy servant,</v>

198
00:07:19.401 --> 00:07:20.930
<v Speaker 1>our father isn't good health,</v>

199
00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:21.800
<v Speaker 1>he's yet alive.</v>

200
00:07:21.801 --> 00:07:24.170
<v Speaker 1>And they bowed down their heads and made oh basins.</v>

201
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.770
<v Speaker 1>And he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin,</v>

202
00:07:30.771 --> 00:07:31.551
<v Speaker 1>his mother's son,</v>

203
00:07:31.551 --> 00:07:32.720
<v Speaker 1>and said,</v>

204
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.570
<v Speaker 1>is this your younger brother of whom you speak unto me?</v>

205
00:07:35.571 --> 00:07:36.440
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

206
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:37.011
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

207
00:07:37.011 --> 00:07:37.910
<v Speaker 1>be gracious unto Thee.</v>

208
00:07:37.911 --> 00:07:38.521
<v Speaker 1>My son.</v>

209
00:07:38.521 --> 00:07:41.690
<v Speaker 1>And Joseph Made Haste for his bowels,</v>

210
00:07:41.691 --> 00:07:43.190
<v Speaker 1>did urine upon his brother,</v>

211
00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:44.840
<v Speaker 1>and he sought where to weep.</v>

212
00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.780
<v Speaker 1>And he entered into his chamber and wept there.</v>

213
00:07:47.781 --> 00:07:50.540
<v Speaker 1>And he washed his face and went out and reframed himself and said,</v>

214
00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:51.830
<v Speaker 1>set on the bread.</v>

215
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:53.960
<v Speaker 1>And they sat before them.</v>

216
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.780
<v Speaker 1>Now he plays another trick on his brother.</v>

217
00:07:55.781 --> 00:07:57.470
<v Speaker 1>So he has them all sit at the table,</v>

218
00:07:57.471 --> 00:07:59.450
<v Speaker 1>but he lines them up according to age.</v>

219
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:01.430
<v Speaker 1>And so he started up,</v>

220
00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:03.770
<v Speaker 1>what is he trying to do?</v>

221
00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:08.120
<v Speaker 1>He started to freak them out fundamentally and so at,</v>

222
00:08:08.121 --> 00:08:11.300
<v Speaker 1>and he manages that because they have no idea how in the world they could</v>

223
00:08:11.301 --> 00:08:11.841
<v Speaker 1>possibly,</v>

224
00:08:11.841 --> 00:08:14.630
<v Speaker 1>he could possibly pull something like that or if they think it's magic.</v>

225
00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:19.840
<v Speaker 1>And the men marveled at one another and he took and sent messages unto them from</v>

226
00:08:19.881 --> 00:08:20.451
<v Speaker 1>before him,</v>

227
00:08:20.451 --> 00:08:23.660
<v Speaker 1>but Benjamin's mess was five times as much as any of theirs.</v>

228
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:24.890
<v Speaker 1>So what's he doing?</v>

229
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:25.881
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

230
00:08:25.881 --> 00:08:27.500
<v Speaker 1>he's testing his brothers again,</v>

231
00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.760
<v Speaker 1>the fact that when he was the child Joseph,</v>

232
00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:36.200
<v Speaker 1>that he got more meant that his brothers got terribly jealous and then</v>

233
00:08:36.201 --> 00:08:36.801
<v Speaker 1>murderous.</v>

234
00:08:36.801 --> 00:08:37.400
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

235
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.310
<v Speaker 1>And so now he's doing the same thing with Benjamin.</v>

236
00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:39.831
<v Speaker 1>He's thinking,</v>

237
00:08:39.831 --> 00:08:40.101
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

238
00:08:40.101 --> 00:08:44.120
<v Speaker 1>well I'll give this kid more than his share</v>

239
00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:50.680
<v Speaker 1>and I'll watch how these reprobates behave and see if they've learned anything.</v>

240
00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:52.123
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

241
00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.950
<v Speaker 1>and he commanded the steward of his house saying,</v>

242
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:55.531
<v Speaker 1>fill the men,</v>

243
00:08:55.531 --> 00:08:59.610
<v Speaker 1>suck with food as much as they can carry and put every man's money in the sock</v>

244
00:08:59.611 --> 00:09:00.444
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>

245
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.380
<v Speaker 1>And put my cup,</v>

246
00:09:01.381 --> 00:09:05.040
<v Speaker 1>the Silver Cup in the sax mouth of the youngest and his core and money.</v>

247
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:08.640
<v Speaker 1>And the steward did according to the word that Joseph had spoken,</v>

248
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:09.930
<v Speaker 1>as soon as the morning was light,</v>

249
00:09:09.931 --> 00:09:13.350
<v Speaker 1>the men were sent away along with their transportation.</v>

250
00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:20.010
<v Speaker 1>They cop is found in Benjamin sack while,</v>

251
00:09:20.011 --> 00:09:22.800
<v Speaker 1>so Benjamin is Kinda young and</v>

252
00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:30.000
<v Speaker 1>Joseph sends out people to find out where the cup is gone and they find it in</v>

253
00:09:30.001 --> 00:09:35.001
<v Speaker 1>Benjamin's in Benjamin sack and they're very upset about this.</v>

254
00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.073
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

255
00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:38.700
<v Speaker 1>they said that a harsh punishment would be fall.</v>

256
00:09:38.701 --> 00:09:40.710
<v Speaker 1>Whoever had the cop in his sock,</v>

257
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:44.700
<v Speaker 1>they rent their clothes and laid at every man his ass and returned to this city.</v>

258
00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.390
<v Speaker 1>Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house for,</v>

259
00:09:47.391 --> 00:09:49.080
<v Speaker 1>he was the out there and they fell before.</v>

260
00:09:49.081 --> 00:09:49.914
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the ground,</v>

261
00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.350
<v Speaker 1>very unhappy and apologetic,</v>

262
00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:53.640
<v Speaker 1>and Joseph said unto them,</v>

263
00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:55.540
<v Speaker 1>what feed is this that you have done?</v>

264
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:56.423
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

265
00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.480
<v Speaker 1>Don't you know that a man like I can certainly divine.</v>

266
00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:01.980
<v Speaker 1>I know what's going on.</v>

267
00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:03.241
<v Speaker 1>And Judah said,</v>

268
00:10:03.241 --> 00:10:04.080
<v Speaker 1>what shall we say?</v>

269
00:10:04.081 --> 00:10:05.040
<v Speaker 1>What shall we speak?</v>

270
00:10:05.041 --> 00:10:07.140
<v Speaker 1>Or how could we possibly clear ourselves?</v>

271
00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.870
<v Speaker 1>God found out the iniquity of thy servants.</v>

272
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:10.651
<v Speaker 1>Behold,</v>

273
00:10:10.651 --> 00:10:11.790
<v Speaker 1>we are your servants,</v>

274
00:10:11.791 --> 00:10:15.810
<v Speaker 1>both we and also he with whom the cup is found.</v>

275
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:17.491
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

276
00:10:17.491 --> 00:10:19.200
<v Speaker 1>God forbid that I should do so,</v>

277
00:10:19.201 --> 00:10:23.580
<v Speaker 1>but the man in whose cup and whose hand to cup is found,</v>

278
00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:27.570
<v Speaker 1>he shall be my servant and has for you get you up in peace to your father.</v>

279
00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.070
<v Speaker 1>It's the discovery of the cup.</v>

280
00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:39.271
<v Speaker 1>Judah says,</v>

281
00:10:39.271 --> 00:10:39.451
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

282
00:10:39.451 --> 00:10:39.871
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>

283
00:10:39.871 --> 00:10:41.340
<v Speaker 1>when I come to the servant,</v>

284
00:10:41.341 --> 00:10:45.360
<v Speaker 1>I father my father and the loud be not with us and seeing that his life is bound</v>

285
00:10:45.361 --> 00:10:46.410
<v Speaker 1>up in the lads life.</v>

286
00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:49.650
<v Speaker 1>It's you'll come to pass when he sees that the loud is not with us,</v>

287
00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:54.360
<v Speaker 1>that he will die and the servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy</v>

288
00:10:54.361 --> 00:10:54.751
<v Speaker 1>servant,</v>

289
00:10:54.751 --> 00:10:56.370
<v Speaker 1>our father with sorrow to the grave.</v>

290
00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:00.450
<v Speaker 1>For Thy Servant became security for the Latin to my father saying,</v>

291
00:11:00.451 --> 00:11:02.070
<v Speaker 1>if I bring him not unto Thee,</v>

292
00:11:02.071 --> 00:11:04.590
<v Speaker 1>then I shall bear the blame to my father forever.</v>

293
00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.300
<v Speaker 1>Now therefore I pray thee.</v>

294
00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:11.480
<v Speaker 1>Let me stay instead of the loud and let the loud go with his brothers for how</v>

295
00:11:12.541 --> 00:11:15.960
<v Speaker 1>shall I go up to my brother and the loud be not with me.</v>

296
00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:17.700
<v Speaker 1>Let's pair adventure.</v>

297
00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:20.040
<v Speaker 1>I shall see the evil that will come on my father.</v>

298
00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:20.851
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

299
00:11:20.851 --> 00:11:21.780
<v Speaker 1>so what's happened?</v>

300
00:11:21.781 --> 00:11:21.961
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

301
00:11:21.961 --> 00:11:22.890
<v Speaker 1>they learned their lesson.</v>

302
00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:28.850
<v Speaker 1>So now Judah again is willing to stand in the place of Benjamin and become a</v>

303
00:11:29.701 --> 00:11:30.720
<v Speaker 1>slave himself.</v>

304
00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:36.170
<v Speaker 1>And so now Joseph has determined that his brothers have developed their</v>

305
00:11:37.561 --> 00:11:41.760
<v Speaker 1>character to the point where reconciliation might be possible.</v>

306
00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:42.721
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

307
00:11:42.721 --> 00:11:46.050
<v Speaker 1>it says you should forgive and forget,</v>

308
00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.240
<v Speaker 1>but the conditions for that are quite,</v>

309
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:51.960
<v Speaker 1>are quite specific.</v>

310
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:52.471
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

311
00:11:52.471 --> 00:11:53.020
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

312
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:57.130
<v Speaker 1>if you have a dispute with someone and they've wronged you in some sense and</v>

313
00:11:57.131 --> 00:11:58.180
<v Speaker 1>they apologize,</v>

314
00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:59.230
<v Speaker 1>the question is,</v>

315
00:11:59.230 --> 00:11:59.381
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

316
00:11:59.381 --> 00:12:00.760
<v Speaker 1>what's the apology?</v>

317
00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:01.180
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

318
00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:03.100
<v Speaker 1>it's a layout of a rationale.</v>

319
00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.353
<v Speaker 1>It's something like,</v>

320
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:05.710
<v Speaker 1>as far as I can tell,</v>

321
00:12:05.711 --> 00:12:08.290
<v Speaker 1>here's the reasons I did this horrible thing.</v>

322
00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:12.760
<v Speaker 1>And here's what I've learned from it and here's what I'm going to do to try not</v>

323
00:12:12.761 --> 00:12:13.660
<v Speaker 1>to do it again.</v>

324
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.060
<v Speaker 1>And would you give me another crack at it?</v>

325
00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:18.490
<v Speaker 1>That's the proper repentance,</v>

326
00:12:18.491 --> 00:12:18.790
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

327
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:21.370
<v Speaker 1>And then you forgive because you're an idiot too,</v>

328
00:12:21.371 --> 00:12:24.700
<v Speaker 1>and you'll probably do something stupid and maybe you'd like the same kind of</v>

329
00:12:24.701 --> 00:12:25.720
<v Speaker 1>break at some point.</v>

330
00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:26.580
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

331
00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:27.251
<v Speaker 1>and besides,</v>

332
00:12:27.251 --> 00:12:31.240
<v Speaker 1>if we all held each other completely to account at all possible times for</v>

333
00:12:31.241 --> 00:12:31.811
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>

334
00:12:31.811 --> 00:12:35.170
<v Speaker 1>then it just be hopeless because there'd be no room for error.</v>

335
00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.470
<v Speaker 1>So if forgiveness,</v>

336
00:12:38.471 --> 00:12:41.110
<v Speaker 1>which Joseph has showing his wise forgiveness,</v>

337
00:12:41.111 --> 00:12:45.040
<v Speaker 1>he's not going to put himself out on the line for people who haven't learned so</v>

338
00:12:45.041 --> 00:12:48.340
<v Speaker 1>that the same stupid thing can happen again so that they can continue to spread</v>

339
00:12:48.341 --> 00:12:49.510
<v Speaker 1>misery wherever they go.</v>

340
00:12:49.511 --> 00:12:51.850
<v Speaker 1>He's going to find out if they've clued in a little bit.</v>

341
00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:53.050
<v Speaker 1>And then if so,</v>

342
00:12:53.051 --> 00:12:55.870
<v Speaker 1>then they can move on with putting the family together.</v>

343
00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:58.240
<v Speaker 1>And so that breaks them up.</v>

344
00:12:58.241 --> 00:12:59.640
<v Speaker 1>He says Joseph could not refrain,</v>

345
00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:03.520
<v Speaker 1>refrain himself before all of them that stood by him and he cried.</v>

346
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:05.710
<v Speaker 1>And then he said,</v>

347
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:07.810
<v Speaker 1>get every mountain away from me.</v>

348
00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:13.990
<v Speaker 1>So all of the people except for Joseph's brother left and there stood no man</v>

349
00:13:13.991 --> 00:13:16.390
<v Speaker 1>with him while Joseph Made himself known unto his brothers.</v>

350
00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:18.910
<v Speaker 1>And Joseph said,</v>

351
00:13:18.911 --> 00:13:21.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm Joseph is my father is still alive.</v>

352
00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:25.780
<v Speaker 1>And his brothers could not answer for they were troubled at his presence.</v>

353
00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:28.053
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

354
00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:33.910
<v Speaker 1>Understatement of the decade there.</v>

355
00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.820
<v Speaker 1>And Joseph said unto his brothers,</v>

356
00:13:36.821 --> 00:13:37.690
<v Speaker 1>come near to me.</v>

357
00:13:37.691 --> 00:13:38.261
<v Speaker 1>I pray you.</v>

358
00:13:38.261 --> 00:13:39.400
<v Speaker 1>And they came near and he said,</v>

359
00:13:39.401 --> 00:13:40.151
<v Speaker 1>I am Joseph,</v>

360
00:13:40.151 --> 00:13:40.541
<v Speaker 1>your brother,</v>

361
00:13:40.541 --> 00:13:41.650
<v Speaker 1>who you sold into Egypt,</v>

362
00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:46.690
<v Speaker 1>but don't be grieved or angry with yourselves that you sold me hither for God</v>

363
00:13:46.691 --> 00:13:48.700
<v Speaker 1>did send me before you to preserve life.</v>

364
00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:52.270
<v Speaker 1>So now it was not you that sent me here,</v>

365
00:13:52.271 --> 00:13:53.104
<v Speaker 1>but God,</v>

366
00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:56.590
<v Speaker 1>and he's made me a father to Pharaoh and Lord of all his house in a ruler</v>

367
00:13:56.591 --> 00:13:58.060
<v Speaker 1>throughout all the land of Egypt.</v>

368
00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.180
<v Speaker 1>Hurry and go to my father and sand to him,</v>

369
00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:03.760
<v Speaker 1>thus say that I son Joseph,</v>

370
00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:06.220
<v Speaker 1>God has made me Lord of all Ge Egypt.</v>

371
00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:08.530
<v Speaker 1>Come down onto me and Terry naught</v>

372
00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:14.320
<v Speaker 1>and now it shall dwell in the land of Gosh and and now shall be near unto me,</v>

373
00:14:14.321 --> 00:14:17.260
<v Speaker 1>Thou and thy children and their children's children and they flocks and herds</v>

374
00:14:17.261 --> 00:14:17.711
<v Speaker 1>and all that.</v>

375
00:14:17.711 --> 00:14:22.711
<v Speaker 1>Thou hast and I there I will nourish you for yet there are five years of famine,</v>

376
00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:24.880
<v Speaker 1>less thou and I household and all that.</v>

377
00:14:24.881 --> 00:14:26.260
<v Speaker 1>Thou has come to poverty,</v>

378
00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.570
<v Speaker 1>so that's the other thing that another bit of a hint,</v>

379
00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:32.560
<v Speaker 1>it's a bread hint here.</v>

380
00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:36.963
<v Speaker 1>Who's the,</v>

381
00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.610
<v Speaker 1>what's the most reliable source of bread?</v>

382
00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:40.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

383
00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:41.320
<v Speaker 1>isn't bread itself,</v>

384
00:14:41.321 --> 00:14:45.370
<v Speaker 1>it's whatever it is that gives rise to bread and that's what Joseph is in this</v>

385
00:14:45.371 --> 00:14:46.000
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

386
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.330
<v Speaker 1>He's the force that gives ride rise to nourishment.</v>

387
00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:53.720
<v Speaker 1>That's an Joseph is often considered a type of Christ,</v>

388
00:14:53.721 --> 00:14:56.150
<v Speaker 1>which means like a precursor in some sense.</v>

389
00:14:56.151 --> 00:14:56.381
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

390
00:14:56.381 --> 00:14:59.330
<v Speaker 1>that's one way of thinking about it and you can see that echoed right there.</v>

391
00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:00.350
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

392
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:01.183
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

393
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:04.070
<v Speaker 1>what do you store up for famine?</v>

394
00:15:04.071 --> 00:15:05.330
<v Speaker 1>You store up character.</v>

395
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.000
<v Speaker 1>That's the best way through.</v>

396
00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:09.681
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

397
00:15:09.681 --> 00:15:11.780
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean you don't also store up bread.</v>

398
00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:17.690
<v Speaker 1>And they went out of Egypt and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob and told</v>

399
00:15:17.691 --> 00:15:21.590
<v Speaker 1>him Joseph is still alive and he's governor and Jacob's heart fainted for he</v>

400
00:15:21.591 --> 00:15:22.424
<v Speaker 1>didn't believe them.</v>

401
00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.350
<v Speaker 1>And they told them all the words of Joseph,</v>

402
00:15:24.351 --> 00:15:25.250
<v Speaker 1>which he said to them.</v>

403
00:15:25.251 --> 00:15:26.600
<v Speaker 1>And when he saw all the wagons,</v>

404
00:15:26.601 --> 00:15:28.130
<v Speaker 1>which Joseph had sent to carry him,</v>

405
00:15:28.131 --> 00:15:29.090
<v Speaker 1>the spirit of Jacob,</v>

406
00:15:29.091 --> 00:15:31.460
<v Speaker 1>their father revived and Israel said,</v>

407
00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:32.593
<v Speaker 1>it is enough,</v>

408
00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:33.051
<v Speaker 1>Joseph,</v>

409
00:15:33.051 --> 00:15:34.070
<v Speaker 1>my son is he had a life.</v>

410
00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.900
<v Speaker 1>I will go and see him before I die.</v>

411
00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:39.230
<v Speaker 1>And Israel took his journey with all that he had and came to Beersheba and</v>

412
00:15:39.231 --> 00:15:41.600
<v Speaker 1>offered sacrifices unto the god of his father,</v>

413
00:15:41.601 --> 00:15:42.434
<v Speaker 1>Isaac.</v>

414
00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:45.410
<v Speaker 1>And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night and said,</v>

415
00:15:45.411 --> 00:15:46.244
<v Speaker 1>Jacob.</v>

416
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:47.151
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

417
00:15:47.151 --> 00:15:48.260
<v Speaker 1>here am I.</v>

418
00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:48.471
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

419
00:15:48.471 --> 00:15:49.190
<v Speaker 1>I am God,</v>

420
00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:50.300
<v Speaker 1>the God of my father.</v>

421
00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:55.040
<v Speaker 1>Don't fear to go to each down into Egypt for I will make you a great nation</v>

422
00:15:55.041 --> 00:15:55.280
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

423
00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:58.640
<v Speaker 1>And so that's how the Israelites end up in Egypt.</v>

424
00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:02.840
<v Speaker 1>I will go down with the and to Egypt and I will also surely bring the up again</v>

425
00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.410
<v Speaker 1>and Jacob shall put his hand upon thy eyes,</v>

426
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:06.190
<v Speaker 1>denies eyes.</v>

427
00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:09.500
<v Speaker 1>And Jacob Rose up from Beer Sheba and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their</v>

428
00:16:09.501 --> 00:16:11.930
<v Speaker 1>father and the little ones and their wives in the wagons,</v>

429
00:16:11.931 --> 00:16:13.390
<v Speaker 1>which pharaoh had sent to carry him.</v>

430
00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:18.320
<v Speaker 1>So the families now all United in the proper state of being that Joseph has</v>

431
00:16:18.321 --> 00:16:21.200
<v Speaker 1>arranged and they took their cattle and their goods.</v>

432
00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:24.710
<v Speaker 1>It's so interesting too because of course Joseph isn't even,</v>

433
00:16:24.711 --> 00:16:28.880
<v Speaker 1>he's a foreigner as well as being a former slave and prisoner,</v>

434
00:16:28.881 --> 00:16:29.714
<v Speaker 1>foreigner,</v>

435
00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:31.040
<v Speaker 1>slave and prisoner.</v>

436
00:16:31.041 --> 00:16:35.300
<v Speaker 1>And yet he ends up ruling Egypt sheer sheerly because of the force of his</v>

437
00:16:35.301 --> 00:16:36.500
<v Speaker 1>character and competence.</v>

438
00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:38.990
<v Speaker 1>And that's really something to think about.</v>

439
00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:44.210
<v Speaker 1>And they took their cattle because that story there is that there isn't anything</v>

440
00:16:44.211 --> 00:16:45.100
<v Speaker 1>stronger than that.</v>

441
00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:48.110
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't matter what the circumstances are that there isn't a forest that's more</v>

442
00:16:48.111 --> 00:16:49.830
<v Speaker 1>powerful not,</v>

443
00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:54.740
<v Speaker 1>and I don't think that that's naive.</v>

444
00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:55.341
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

445
00:16:55.341 --> 00:16:57.230
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the exact opposite of naive.</v>

446
00:16:59.000 --> 00:16:59.870
<v Speaker 1>No matter where you are,</v>

447
00:16:59.871 --> 00:17:01.280
<v Speaker 1>you can generally make things better.</v>

448
00:17:01.281 --> 00:17:02.330
<v Speaker 1>If that's what you want to do,</v>

449
00:17:02.331 --> 00:17:06.770
<v Speaker 1>and unless you're in in a place that's really hell itself,</v>

450
00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:11.030
<v Speaker 1>not usually is something that elevates you in,</v>

451
00:17:11.031 --> 00:17:12.350
<v Speaker 1>elevates the people around you,</v>

452
00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:17.450
<v Speaker 1>and you can do that wherever you are because there isn't a place that's so small</v>

453
00:17:17.451 --> 00:17:18.380
<v Speaker 1>that you can't do that.</v>

454
00:17:18.381 --> 00:17:19.760
<v Speaker 1>That's the message of the prison.</v>
