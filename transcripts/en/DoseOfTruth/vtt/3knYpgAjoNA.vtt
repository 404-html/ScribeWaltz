1
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.970
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to match matches your</v>
<v Speaker 1>weaknesses.</v>

2
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.980
<v Speaker 1>The Parker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much everybody knows what those</v>

3
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.510
<v Speaker 1>weaknesses are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4
00:00:20.511 --> 00:00:23.740
<v Speaker 1>some people would smoke too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too much,</v>

5
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.290
<v Speaker 1>and some people would be unfaithful and</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a comfort productive areas.</v>

6
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.720
<v Speaker 1>Some people would end up on the street</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they would generate.</v>

7
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.830
<v Speaker 1>Everybody kind of knows how they fall</v>
<v Speaker 1>apart if they fell apart in their own</v>

8
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.940
<v Speaker 1>idiosyncratic and spectacular manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those sorts of things that keep you</v>

9
00:00:43.941 --> 00:00:45.060
<v Speaker 1>awake at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you.</v>

10
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.350
<v Speaker 1>If you contemplate them deeply,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where would you be interested?</v>

11
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.270
<v Speaker 1>Five years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you let her go directly to hell,</v>

12
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.480
<v Speaker 1>that's useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's useful because then see it's one</v>

13
00:00:59.481 --> 00:01:02.230
<v Speaker 1>thing that want to make yourself because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see them.</v>

14
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.760
<v Speaker 1>What you're doing is moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have something that you want,</v>

15
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.080
<v Speaker 1>but that's whole hope is a powerful</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion,</v>

16
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.800
<v Speaker 1>but terror acts and so one of the things</v>
<v Speaker 1>out with my clinical clients,</v>

17
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.550
<v Speaker 1>it's their baby.</v>

18
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.830
<v Speaker 1>They don't have a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They really like,</v>

19
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's grinding away at your soul and</v>

20
00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.140
<v Speaker 1>just leave your job into another job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's actually a really complicated</v>

21
00:01:30.141 --> 00:01:30.651
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

22
00:01:30.651 --> 00:01:33.680
<v Speaker 1>If you don't like your job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just a psychological problem,</v>

23
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.530
<v Speaker 1>have to have a job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise you die.</v>

24
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.650
<v Speaker 1>So it's a cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so just changing the battery,</v>

25
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.670
<v Speaker 1>just adjusting yourself psychologically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might be planning to change your</v>

26
00:01:46.671 --> 00:01:48.660
<v Speaker 1>job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to update your CV and maybe you</v>

27
00:01:48.661 --> 00:01:52.430
<v Speaker 1>have to make your skills and we've gotta</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to be a little more</v>

28
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.090
<v Speaker 1>credit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Melinda,</v>

29
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.880
<v Speaker 1>an interview and you have to overcome</v>
<v Speaker 1>your fear of rejection.</v>

30
00:01:55.881 --> 00:01:59.390
<v Speaker 1>Like there may be all sorts of things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that African set yourself up to move</v>

31
00:01:59.391 --> 00:02:04.391
<v Speaker 1>laterally or let's say to a different</v>
<v Speaker 1>position when it's more engaging and uh,</v>

32
00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be,</v>

33
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.460
<v Speaker 1>you might be willing to do that.</v>

34
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.650
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you were afraid of doing now</v>

35
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:24.401
<v Speaker 1>and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

36
00:02:24.401 --> 00:02:26.380
<v Speaker 1>if I'm afraid of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why should I do it?</v>

37
00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.550
<v Speaker 1>People ask themselves the same question</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I have a difficult conversation to</v>

38
00:02:30.551 --> 00:02:33.550
<v Speaker 1>have with their wives or their children</v>
<v Speaker 1>or their parents,</v>

39
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of us are very conflict</v>

40
00:02:35.771 --> 00:02:39.150
<v Speaker 1>diverse and there are difficult</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations to have.</v>

41
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.390
<v Speaker 1>And the reason is is because they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>awkward and make us afraid.</v>

42
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.710
<v Speaker 1>So you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

43
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.470
<v Speaker 1>why the hell is it makes you afraid?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not just not,</v>

44
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.400
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the ideas that keeps</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in jobs they hate and in</v>

45
00:02:53.471 --> 00:02:56.910
<v Speaker 1>relationships with and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it stops them from repairing or</v>

46
00:02:56.911 --> 00:02:59.230
<v Speaker 1>relationships with some very difficult</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to do.</v>

47
00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.960
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

48
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.900
<v Speaker 1>let's imagine that you just keep doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that you don't like,</v>

49
00:03:06.901 --> 00:03:09.510
<v Speaker 1>that you don't change it because you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid to,</v>

50
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.460
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you afraid of what happens if you</v>

51
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:13.294
<v Speaker 1>don't change it?</v>

52
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.000
<v Speaker 1>And if you lay out this little hail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I described it really in a one way</v>

53
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:22.660
<v Speaker 1>so you know where you would degenerate</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were going to degenerate.</v>

54
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.930
<v Speaker 1>And then you look at life and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well here's a bunch of things that are</v>

55
00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.830
<v Speaker 1>not doing because I'm afraid that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

56
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.250
<v Speaker 1>keeping me secure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

57
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.113
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

58
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.790
<v Speaker 1>It's just taking you to that place that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you lay down.</v>

59
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.200
<v Speaker 1>It's an absolute catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so sometimes the answer to why</v>

60
00:03:38.201 --> 00:03:42.850
<v Speaker 1>should I do this thing that I've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting off is well,</v>

61
00:03:42.851 --> 00:03:45.100
<v Speaker 1>otherwise they end up in this particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>hell.</v>

62
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.150
<v Speaker 1>I already know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I already know the parameters of and so</v>

63
00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.140
<v Speaker 1>hope can help you move out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be better if I did this,</v>

64
00:03:53.141 --> 00:03:57.520
<v Speaker 1>but fear of not doing it and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>

65
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.250
<v Speaker 1>That's where you've been and what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>better yet is to have both of them</v>

66
00:04:00.251 --> 00:04:03.250
<v Speaker 1>working in tandem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so psychologists figured this out when</v>

67
00:04:03.251 --> 00:04:06.490
<v Speaker 1>they were looking at sphere years ago</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm trying to figure out how to</v>

68
00:04:06.491 --> 00:04:11.491
<v Speaker 1>motivate them to do things like run down</v>
<v Speaker 1>a major update and reward.</v>

69
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.020
<v Speaker 1>Turns out that a hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hungry,</v>

70
00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:17.160
<v Speaker 1>rapid run down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little bays quite rapidly get a</v>

71
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.350
<v Speaker 1>cheesy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if that brand is,</v>

72
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.980
<v Speaker 1>if you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have the hungry wrap and you walk</v>

73
00:04:23.981 --> 00:04:28.981
<v Speaker 1>in some capital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>expats are terrified of cats and even if</v>

74
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.360
<v Speaker 1>they've never met a capital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a different smell.</v>

75
00:04:31.361 --> 00:04:34.010
<v Speaker 1>The cash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know what cat smell like and like.</v>

76
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.960
<v Speaker 1>And so if you take your hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grab and throw in a little caterpillar,</v>

77
00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:43.170
<v Speaker 1>he'll sit down that runway like nap much</v>
<v Speaker 1>faster than one that's just hungry.</v>

78
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.420
<v Speaker 1>So running away from something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're terrified out.</v>

79
00:04:47.421 --> 00:04:51.220
<v Speaker 1>We're avoiding something that your</v>
<v Speaker 1>property terrified though and running</v>

80
00:04:51.221 --> 00:04:54.550
<v Speaker 1>towards something you want is a good way</v>
<v Speaker 1>of being maximally motivate people and</v>

81
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.840
<v Speaker 1>so with the second part of that program</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have people,</v>

82
00:04:58.841 --> 00:05:03.841
<v Speaker 1>they don't have very detailed plan about</v>
<v Speaker 1>their position in the briefing.</v>

83
00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.650
<v Speaker 1>If April's prior quiz tools and figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you be better if he would take</v>

84
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.800
<v Speaker 1>the first goal was how would your</v>
<v Speaker 1>families be better?</v>

85
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.700
<v Speaker 1>Also with maybe how it would be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit to the community if you would</v>

86
00:05:18.701 --> 00:05:22.570
<v Speaker 1>take that book because it'd be nice if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could sort yourself out in ways that</v>

87
00:05:22.571 --> 00:05:26.950
<v Speaker 1>also sorted out your family and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>also sort of your community and since</v>

88
00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:29.170
<v Speaker 1>you're making a plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but where the hell no name for all</v>

89
00:05:29.171 --> 00:05:31.520
<v Speaker 1>three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more sustainable anyways.</v>

90
00:05:31.521 --> 00:05:36.220
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this broke the famous psychologist</v>

91
00:05:36.221 --> 00:05:37.210
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Piaget hold,</v>

92
00:05:37.211 --> 00:05:40.690
<v Speaker 1>that included a braided state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said that it's like a game that</v>

93
00:05:40.691 --> 00:05:43.300
<v Speaker 1>everyone wants to play with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's better if you're going to play a</v>

94
00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:47.320
<v Speaker 1>game to play a game that everyone wants</v>
<v Speaker 1>to play and that's a good.</v>

95
00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.180
<v Speaker 1>That's a good indication that it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good game.</v>

96
00:05:49.181 --> 00:05:52.080
<v Speaker 1>And so if you could figure out how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fix yourself off in a way that would</v>

97
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.040
<v Speaker 1>simple phineas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they fix up your family and your</v>

98
00:05:54.041 --> 00:05:55.130
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

99
00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.720
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody wins and maybe it would be</v>

100
00:06:01.011 --> 00:06:02.840
<v Speaker 1>good to play a game that everybody wins.</v>

101
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:08.470
<v Speaker 1>So we don't think of games that often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's certainly possible in 25 exists</v>

102
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.260
<v Speaker 1>and so well back to courage and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>free speech.</v>

103
00:06:15.261 --> 00:06:18.980
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I do recommend</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people who try these programs is</v>

104
00:06:18.981 --> 00:06:23.981
<v Speaker 1>that they do the map because if that</v>
<v Speaker 1>plan has been that the no plan at all</v>

105
00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.030
<v Speaker 1>and you're going to come up with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>better plan because what they have and</v>

106
00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:31.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it's either a bad plan or no plan</v>

107
00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:36.910
<v Speaker 1>and no Glenn is way worse than a bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least when you implemented that plan</v>

108
00:06:36.911 --> 00:06:39.710
<v Speaker 1>and you start walking towards what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>plan lays out,</v>

109
00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:44.110
<v Speaker 1>you'll see specifically where it is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're an error like specifically.</v>

110
00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.130
<v Speaker 1>And you'll learn from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you can use what you learn</v>

111
00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.060
<v Speaker 1>while you're making the mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Implementing your plan to make a better</v>

112
00:06:52.061 --> 00:06:54.760
<v Speaker 1>plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you keep doing that eventually,</v>

113
00:06:54.761 --> 00:06:56.220
<v Speaker 1>like there'll be a lot of failure along</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way.</v>

114
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.690
<v Speaker 1>That's the adventure of your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

115
