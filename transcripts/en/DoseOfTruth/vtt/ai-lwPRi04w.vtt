1
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:03.361
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2
00:00:03.361 --> 00:00:06.150
<v Speaker 1>I think certainly one of the things I've learned,</v>

3
00:00:06.151 --> 00:00:06.421
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

4
00:00:06.421 --> 00:00:10.950
<v Speaker 1>I already knew before all this happened that people were primarily conforming.</v>

5
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.690
<v Speaker 1>I actually don't have much of a problem with that because most of the time the</v>

6
00:00:15.691 --> 00:00:17.250
<v Speaker 1>tradition is correct,</v>

7
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.460
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes it's not correct at all.</v>

8
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.810
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem is that,</v>

9
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:22.920
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

10
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.400
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I always tell my clients and my students for that matter is</v>

11
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.820
<v Speaker 1>you should do what everyone else does unless you have a really good reason to</v>

12
00:00:31.951 --> 00:00:32.784
<v Speaker 1>vary.</v>

13
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.490
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I learned from young Carl Young was that,</v>

14
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.600
<v Speaker 1>and if you do very,</v>

15
00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:39.690
<v Speaker 1>you should try to only do it in a couple of directions because you probably</v>

16
00:00:39.691 --> 00:00:41.310
<v Speaker 1>can't handle doing it more than that.</v>

17
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.460
<v Speaker 1>It's just too much to too much psychologically.</v>

18
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:45.601
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

19
00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:49.830
<v Speaker 1>the problem is is that sometimes the group is rowing off a cliff and then it's</v>

20
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:50.940
<v Speaker 1>then you know,</v>

21
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.320
<v Speaker 1>that's partly why the individual in some senses the eternal savior of the group</v>

22
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.370
<v Speaker 1>because the group has,</v>

23
00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.320
<v Speaker 1>it has the aspect of sheep,</v>

24
00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.131
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

25
00:00:59.131 --> 00:01:00.840
<v Speaker 1>and the sheep are doing fine.</v>

26
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.000
<v Speaker 1>They've got the whole herd thing going for them,</v>

27
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.610
<v Speaker 1>decreases the risk of individual predation.</v>

28
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.740
<v Speaker 1>They've got all their nervous systems in tune.</v>

29
00:01:07.741 --> 00:01:09.450
<v Speaker 1>So there's real utility in the herd,</v>

30
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.880
<v Speaker 1>but they're also subject to all the problems that herds have like heard panic</v>

31
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.240
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

32
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.500
<v Speaker 1>so that's not good enough.</v>

33
00:01:16.501 --> 00:01:19.800
<v Speaker 1>That's what human beings figured out was that being part of the herd,</v>

34
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.970
<v Speaker 1>although necessary,</v>

35
00:01:20.971 --> 00:01:21.930
<v Speaker 1>isn't good enough.</v>

36
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.080
<v Speaker 1>There has to be a balance between the tradition,</v>

37
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.550
<v Speaker 1>the old dead tradition and the river vivifying force of the,</v>

38
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.350
<v Speaker 1>of the law of the living.</v>

39
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.790
<v Speaker 1>Essentially that's,</v>

40
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.570
<v Speaker 1>those are actually how the gods split up and need you.</v>

41
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.670
<v Speaker 1>Because Horace was roughly a representation of the living and oh,</v>

42
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.630
<v Speaker 1>Cyrus was roughly a representation of the dead and it was the combined</v>

43
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.440
<v Speaker 1>combination of those two that made up the sovereign very intelligent,</v>

44
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.410
<v Speaker 1>like dramatic political philosophy.</v>

45
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.431
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

46
00:01:50.431 --> 00:01:51.270
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

47
00:01:51.271 --> 00:01:53.640
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I have seen since September is,</v>

48
00:01:53.641 --> 00:01:53.911
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

49
00:01:53.911 --> 00:01:56.520
<v Speaker 1>I knew that people were conformance,</v>

50
00:01:56.521 --> 00:01:57.480
<v Speaker 1>but I really had,</v>

51
00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.540
<v Speaker 1>I really had no idea to what degree that was true.</v>

52
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.531
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

53
00:02:01.531 --> 00:02:01.741
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

54
00:02:01.741 --> 00:02:03.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've got ver very,</v>

55
00:02:03.811 --> 00:02:07.290
<v Speaker 1>very few letters of support from people who are academics for example.</v>

56
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:08.220
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>

57
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.440
<v Speaker 1>I get secret reports really.</v>

58
00:02:10.441 --> 00:02:10.681
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

59
00:02:10.681 --> 00:02:11.640
<v Speaker 1>people will come and say,</v>

60
00:02:11.641 --> 00:02:12.240
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

61
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.350
<v Speaker 1>we agree with what you're doing,</v>

62
00:02:13.351 --> 00:02:15.240
<v Speaker 1>but we wish you could be a little nicer about it.</v>

63
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.373
<v Speaker 1>Which,</v>

64
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.340
<v Speaker 1>which we know it's a funny thing for people to say because it implies that if</v>

65
00:02:20.341 --> 00:02:21.300
<v Speaker 1>they did what I was doing,</v>

66
00:02:21.301 --> 00:02:22.530
<v Speaker 1>they would do a better job,</v>

67
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:23.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

68
00:02:23.251 --> 00:02:24.270
<v Speaker 1>in which is fine,</v>

69
00:02:24.271 --> 00:02:24.991
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

70
00:02:24.991 --> 00:02:27.060
<v Speaker 1>you can always try it out and see how it goes.</v>

71
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.830
<v Speaker 1>So when I gave talks,</v>

72
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.953
<v Speaker 1>equity,</v>

73
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.370
<v Speaker 1>one of the most common comments I would get after the thing's over and people</v>

74
00:02:35.371 --> 00:02:36.204
<v Speaker 1>are finally,</v>

75
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.960
<v Speaker 1>I agree with everything you said,</v>

76
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.863
<v Speaker 1>I would never,</v>

77
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:40.620
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

78
00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.861
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

79
00:02:40.861 --> 00:02:42.270
<v Speaker 1>Well it's no wonder it's,</v>

80
00:02:42.271 --> 00:02:42.461
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

81
00:02:42.461 --> 00:02:43.440
<v Speaker 1>it's not surprising,</v>

82
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.801
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

83
00:02:43.801 --> 00:02:44.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

84
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.860
<v Speaker 1>there are real reasons not to stick out from the herd.</v>

85
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.390
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

86
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.180
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

87
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.410
<v Speaker 1>if you mark a zebra so that you can identify it against the herd,</v>

88
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.850
<v Speaker 1>the lions will kill it.</v>

89
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.411
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

90
00:02:55.411 --> 00:02:56.244
<v Speaker 1>And that's that.</v>

91
00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.240
<v Speaker 1>Then I tell you,</v>

92
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.180
<v Speaker 1>no one that you like that because they can't,</v>

93
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.660
<v Speaker 1>they can't organize their haunted less.</v>

94
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:03.390
<v Speaker 1>They can identify the individual</v>

95
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.881
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

96
00:03:05.881 --> 00:03:06.290
<v Speaker 1>While they're,</v>

97
00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.610
<v Speaker 1>they're camouflaged against the herd zebras.</v>

98
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.901
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

99
00:03:09.901 --> 00:03:10.201
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

100
00:03:10.201 --> 00:03:11.040
<v Speaker 1>that's worth knowing.</v>

101
00:03:11.041 --> 00:03:12.330
<v Speaker 1>It explains a lot that.</v>
