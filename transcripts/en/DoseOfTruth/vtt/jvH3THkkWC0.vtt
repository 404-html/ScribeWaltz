1
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.893
<v Speaker 1>You don't</v>

2
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.550
<v Speaker 1>take the opportunity to deliberately</v>

3
00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:26.190
<v Speaker 1>as an opportunity to have a conversation with a very large number of people</v>

4
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.420
<v Speaker 1>because a good lecture,</v>

5
00:00:27.421 --> 00:00:28.860
<v Speaker 1>it's our second conversation because</v>

6
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.950
<v Speaker 1>people in the audience going to make sure that everyone's going in the same</v>

7
00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:35.784
<v Speaker 1>direction,</v>

8
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.910
<v Speaker 1>but also to push my thinking beyond where I've gone and telling you things that</v>

9
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.870
<v Speaker 1>are going to rely on things that I think I know,</v>

10
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.900
<v Speaker 1>but I'm trying to lead them into something new so I can push it just a little</v>

11
00:00:51.901 --> 00:00:53.440
<v Speaker 1>bit far out we are.</v>

12
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.340
<v Speaker 1>That makes us a lecture because there's something alive about that.</v>

13
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious to deliver by</v>

14
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.960
<v Speaker 1>delivering a talk to the content side.</v>

15
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:09.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to learn some things that are most important and I'm trying to do</v>

16
00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:12.750
<v Speaker 1>that in real time.</v>

17
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.413
<v Speaker 1>So that's.</v>

18
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:15.810
<v Speaker 1>That's the plan.</v>

19
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.710
<v Speaker 1>So the first</v>

20
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.230
<v Speaker 1>rule is not what is expedient</v>

21
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:44.673
<v Speaker 1>because.</v>

22
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.010
<v Speaker 1>Because I think</v>

23
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.620
<v Speaker 1>there's a great question.</v>

24
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.650
<v Speaker 1>Our culture about whether or not the experience of meeting or the real or the</v>

25
00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.680
<v Speaker 1>experience say whether or not that's real key is to figure out what's freedom.</v>

26
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.110
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

27
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.280
<v Speaker 1>we were founded.</v>

28
00:02:07.281 --> 00:02:12.281
<v Speaker 1>The German back material reality is at least clean that</v>

29
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.880
<v Speaker 1>we constructed the signed five years ago and we believe that so far it seems</v>

30
00:02:24.681 --> 00:02:26.670
<v Speaker 1>self evident to some degree is,</v>

31
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's something pretty breathable material railroad</v>

32
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.550
<v Speaker 1>and our mastery of it from a technical perspective in comparatively powerful and</v>

33
00:02:40.911 --> 00:02:42.740
<v Speaker 1>increasingly so and so,</v>

34
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.950
<v Speaker 1>and it has improved our lives as well and so you don't want to</v>

35
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.640
<v Speaker 1>denigrate the maturity was,</v>

36
00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.903
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

37
00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.590
<v Speaker 1>just because that's a good way of looking at the world is be the</v>

38
00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.520
<v Speaker 1>best way and it's also actually not our people.</v>

39
00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:07.894
<v Speaker 1>Look at the world.</v>

40
00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.800
<v Speaker 1>It's just a company in the world and</v>

41
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.100
<v Speaker 1>the way that people seem to in our world is,</v>

42
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.190
<v Speaker 1>is as if the experience of meeting is the most real and I think you can see that</v>

43
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.120
<v Speaker 1>most particularly if people's responses to pain because pain is a form of</v>

44
00:03:27.911 --> 00:03:28.520
<v Speaker 1>leaving,</v>

45
00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.353
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

46
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.760
<v Speaker 1>Generative experience.</v>

47
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.230
<v Speaker 1>It's an emotional experience.</v>

48
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.180
<v Speaker 1>It's not self evidently material because it has that suggested element,</v>

49
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.040
<v Speaker 1>but it's a very rare person.</v>

50
00:03:39.041 --> 00:03:43.390
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't matter because if they believe their pain is real and so I think</v>

51
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.530
<v Speaker 1>that's an interesting.</v>

52
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.410
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting fact because if you're nihilistic,</v>

53
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:49.370
<v Speaker 1>can you believe was like,</v>

54
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.410
<v Speaker 1>that's not meaning,</v>

55
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.680
<v Speaker 1>that isn't going to help yourself with your pain,</v>

56
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.260
<v Speaker 1>and so even if you're an Ios,</v>

57
00:03:55.261 --> 00:03:58.720
<v Speaker 1>we believe in the reality of suffering about something,</v>

58
00:03:58.721 --> 00:04:03.721
<v Speaker 1>you know in our ground students to realize that actually here there's something</v>

59
00:04:04.181 --> 00:04:09.181
<v Speaker 1>that I could take seriously even in my dope and like disparate tape.</v>

60
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.000
<v Speaker 1>The fact that that misery genuinely exists.</v>

61
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:16.600
<v Speaker 1>I can take that seriously and that's actually a hell of a fine starting point.</v>

62
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.040
<v Speaker 1>Don't descarte the philosopher,</v>

63
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.790
<v Speaker 1>when he was looking for a place to stand,</v>

64
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.880
<v Speaker 1>he underwent the process that you described as radical without trying to doubt</v>

65
00:04:28.881 --> 00:04:32.890
<v Speaker 1>everything you can possibly know and they make any ended up only being able to</v>

66
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.950
<v Speaker 1>not go with one thing which was that he existed as a person who go,</v>

67
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.390
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't doubt the existence of social consciousness</v>

68
00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.290
<v Speaker 1>and that's where the famous line I think therefore I am looking from and you get</v>

69
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.320
<v Speaker 1>really be an ad for like proceed or or my experience exists or something like</v>

70
00:04:54.491 --> 00:04:54.851
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

71
00:04:54.851 --> 00:04:59.700
<v Speaker 1>That's something that I can get a good job taking that are in part,</v>

72
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.460
<v Speaker 1>but I know go into that</v>

73
00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:09.370
<v Speaker 1>so that you can't criticize that fundamental axiom with quite a bit of success</v>

74
00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.880
<v Speaker 1>and I've even been something that was similar,</v>

75
00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.660
<v Speaker 1>although I didn't know it at the time because I was looking for something that I</v>

76
00:05:16.661 --> 00:05:19.470
<v Speaker 1>couldn't doubt that I couldn't do it.</v>

77
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:20.770
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really care what it was,</v>

78
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.480
<v Speaker 1>but if it's just like a for and for me,</v>

79
00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:26.740
<v Speaker 1>it didn't end up being.</v>

80
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.360
<v Speaker 1>I think therefore I am.</v>

81
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.090
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't even the reality of my consciousness,</v>

82
00:05:31.091 --> 00:05:34.210
<v Speaker 1>which is where they ended up with the reality of the pain.</v>

83
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:35.231
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

84
00:05:35.231 --> 00:05:35.951
<v Speaker 1>well that's the one thing.</v>

85
00:05:35.951 --> 00:05:36.950
<v Speaker 1>I cannot demand it,</v>

86
00:05:36.951 --> 00:05:37.810
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

87
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.660
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

88
00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.660
<v Speaker 1>the suffering exists as real mining and other people and that's pretty</v>

89
00:05:44.921 --> 00:05:46.420
<v Speaker 1>pessimistic in some sense.</v>

90
00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:47.081
<v Speaker 1>If you think,</v>

91
00:05:47.081 --> 00:05:47.261
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

92
00:05:47.261 --> 00:05:48.850
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental reality of suffering,</v>

93
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.760
<v Speaker 1>but I also learned at approximately the same time,</v>

94
00:05:51.761 --> 00:05:55.370
<v Speaker 1>but that was pretty high level religious claim.</v>

95
00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.660
<v Speaker 1>The might</v>

96
00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.520
<v Speaker 1>listen in Judaism because history of the Jews in history,</v>

97
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.210
<v Speaker 1>in some sense of suffering,</v>

98
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:12.560
<v Speaker 1>it's clearly the in Christianity because of course the central finger</v>

99
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:13.221
<v Speaker 1>Christianity.</v>

100
00:06:13.221 --> 00:06:17.800
<v Speaker 1>As someone who's nailed to a cross courtroom to data and and guys,</v>

101
00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:18.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

102
00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.030
<v Speaker 1>incredibly painful back,</v>

103
00:06:20.031 --> 00:06:25.031
<v Speaker 1>so even if even if it's not explicitly laid down the fundamental reality like</v>

104
00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.080
<v Speaker 1>the suffering sort of right there as the image.</v>

105
00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:30.653
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

106
00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:33.560
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

107
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.393
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

108
00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:39.460
<v Speaker 1>that's a very pessimistic way of looking at the world and that might be true,</v>

109
00:06:39.981 --> 00:06:41.750
<v Speaker 1>but it might not be because</v>

110
00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:49.060
<v Speaker 1>obviously the fact that there's a pessimistic stack is pessimistic about the</v>

111
00:06:50.331 --> 00:06:52.820
<v Speaker 1>fact that you admitted to that back.</v>

112
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.970
<v Speaker 1>That's not necessarily so pessimistic.</v>

113
00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:56.930
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

114
00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.840
<v Speaker 1>imagine that you're afraid of something that's hard to imagine,</v>

115
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.120
<v Speaker 1>but then imagine that you can notice you're afraid.</v>

116
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:03.350
<v Speaker 1>Anything come to terms with it.</v>

117
00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:07.040
<v Speaker 1>What that means immediately is that no matter how large,</v>

118
00:07:07.041 --> 00:07:11.330
<v Speaker 1>the furious that there's something in you could recognize that and then</v>

119
00:07:11.331 --> 00:07:12.880
<v Speaker 1>conceivably transcendent.</v>

120
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:18.260
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that I learned about understanding the reality of both</v>

121
00:07:18.261 --> 00:07:21.500
<v Speaker 1>tragedy and malevolence because I think those two things together make up</v>

122
00:07:21.501 --> 00:07:22.970
<v Speaker 1>suffering and tragedy.</v>

123
00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:27.410
<v Speaker 1>Use the fact that you're prone to illness and an old aging,</v>

124
00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:27.831
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

125
00:07:27.831 --> 00:07:29.270
<v Speaker 1>all of those old buildings.</v>

126
00:07:29.271 --> 00:07:29.421
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

127
00:07:29.421 --> 00:07:29.951
<v Speaker 1>the flesh,</v>

128
00:07:29.951 --> 00:07:30.784
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

129
00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:32.150
<v Speaker 1>and millennials of course,</v>

130
00:07:32.151 --> 00:07:36.140
<v Speaker 1>is that there's always someone around making who's willing to make it a more</v>

131
00:07:36.141 --> 00:07:41.141
<v Speaker 1>worse than it has to be and that might even be you fundamental reality of human</v>

132
00:07:42.471 --> 00:07:44.450
<v Speaker 1>existence so,</v>

133
00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:49.540
<v Speaker 1>but simultaneously there's that capacity to serve that and contend with it and</v>

134
00:07:51.111 --> 00:07:56.111
<v Speaker 1>then start to and then start to work in forward looking manner.</v>

135
00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:57.230
<v Speaker 1>Despite that,</v>

136
00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:59.390
<v Speaker 1>and so one of the things,</v>

137
00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:04.450
<v Speaker 1>the second thing are you going to say after I was willing to put forward that as</v>

138
00:08:05.631 --> 00:08:07.100
<v Speaker 1>a fundamental proposition,</v>

139
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:11.890
<v Speaker 1>the whole reality of suffering is that way secondary.</v>

140
00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:12.750
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

141
00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:17.060
<v Speaker 1>that's not our most fundamental truth for most fundamental truth is that people</v>

142
00:08:17.061 --> 00:08:21.080
<v Speaker 1>are capable of transcending that and so that takes the thing that's most</v>

143
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:24.590
<v Speaker 1>pessimistic and turns into perversely,</v>

144
00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:29.620
<v Speaker 1>strangely and paradoxically immediately turns it into something that's almost</v>

145
00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:34.040
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably optimistic because you can't imagine how you could possibly give</v>

146
00:08:34.041 --> 00:08:37.570
<v Speaker 1>people more credit and the book the most terrible thing you could.</v>

147
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.380
<v Speaker 1>Magic happens to be true.</v>

148
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:42.880
<v Speaker 1>Life is limited and rural,</v>

149
00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:45.950
<v Speaker 1>tormented by this fundamental truth,</v>

150
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:50.170
<v Speaker 1>but if we admitted to that at faith based or greatly,</v>

151
00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:51.980
<v Speaker 1>then we can transcend it.</v>

152
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:52.770
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

153
00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:53.331
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>

154
00:08:53.331 --> 00:08:54.164
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

155
00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 1>what's your evidence for that?</v>

156
00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:57.693
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

157
00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.370
<v Speaker 1>the evidence for that,</v>

158
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:01.080
<v Speaker 1>it's actually overwhelming.</v>

159
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.800
<v Speaker 1>The first thing is while you're here,</v>

160
00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:04.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

161
00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:04.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

162
00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.400
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that the fundamental conditions of your life in some sense,</v>

163
00:09:08.401 --> 00:09:09.420
<v Speaker 1>the group,</v>

164
00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:14.220
<v Speaker 1>you get yourself out of bed in the morning and you go do your difficult jobs,</v>

165
00:09:14.221 --> 00:09:17.880
<v Speaker 1>that you take care of your families and you exist in the world despite its</v>

166
00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:18.930
<v Speaker 1>limitations.</v>

167
00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:20.130
<v Speaker 1>And even more importantly,</v>

168
00:09:20.131 --> 00:09:21.480
<v Speaker 1>and this is something I'll return to,</v>

169
00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:25.520
<v Speaker 1>this is also something very much we're thinking is that you know,</v>

170
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:28.660
<v Speaker 1>you've got a relationship with people around you and some of them you actually.</v>

171
00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:32.700
<v Speaker 1>And that's a strange thing because those people that you love,</v>

172
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:37.790
<v Speaker 1>their lights are characterized by limitation and there's a lot and maybe three</v>

173
00:09:37.791 --> 00:09:41.940
<v Speaker 1>to change it by a certain muscles in the left ones and your judgment because you</v>

174
00:09:41.941 --> 00:09:42.751
<v Speaker 1>do care for them,</v>

175
00:09:42.751 --> 00:09:45.330
<v Speaker 1>is that despite all that they're around.</v>

176
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.810
<v Speaker 1>Because that's actually the judgment that you make when you actually care for</v>

177
00:09:48.811 --> 00:09:49.231
<v Speaker 1>someone.</v>

178
00:09:49.231 --> 00:09:49.770
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

179
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:50.160
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>

180
00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:50.993
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

181
00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:52.680
<v Speaker 1>you know exactly what,</v>

182
00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.720
<v Speaker 1>but despite their limitations,</v>

183
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:59.010
<v Speaker 1>really you actually care for the large part because of their limitations,</v>

184
00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.390
<v Speaker 1>which is a strange thing because</v>

185
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:07.230
<v Speaker 1>then the radio superseded and limitations and weaknesses are all part of that</v>

186
00:10:07.711 --> 00:10:08.370
<v Speaker 1>package.</v>

187
00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:11.460
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you don't think that maybe they could use some improvement,</v>

188
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:14.490
<v Speaker 1>but still the overall.</v>

189
00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:15.300
<v Speaker 1>Chuck's,</v>

190
00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:16.091
<v Speaker 1>when you love someone,</v>

191
00:10:16.091 --> 00:10:18.120
<v Speaker 1>you overall general thing is that all things considered,</v>

192
00:10:18.121 --> 00:10:19.140
<v Speaker 1>it's been consistent,</v>

193
00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:22.390
<v Speaker 1>that they are serious,</v>

194
00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.570
<v Speaker 1>that's jumping</v>

195
00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.650
<v Speaker 1>and I'm just thinking about myself,</v>

196
00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:30.740
<v Speaker 1>but he was a kid.</v>

197
00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:35.243
<v Speaker 1>No</v>

198
00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:37.843
<v Speaker 1>kid,</v>

199
00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:42.710
<v Speaker 1>especially kids from.</v>

200
00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:44.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

201
00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:44.940
<v Speaker 1>when they're under three,</v>

202
00:10:44.941 --> 00:10:48.890
<v Speaker 1>they're pretty damn and are resilient in some ways,</v>

203
00:10:48.891 --> 00:10:49.530
<v Speaker 1>but they're,</v>

204
00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:50.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

205
00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:53.490
<v Speaker 1>they knew what the hell to do it and just take note there.</v>

206
00:10:53.491 --> 00:10:58.491
<v Speaker 1>That can hurt and so you have to be a wait to make sure that nothing terrible</v>

207
00:10:59.100 --> 00:10:59.933
<v Speaker 1>happens to them.</v>

208
00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:05.590
<v Speaker 1>They're not holding too much by other children or their siblings or their</v>

209
00:11:05.791 --> 00:11:07.020
<v Speaker 1>parents for that matter.</v>

210
00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:11.520
<v Speaker 1>You know the baby that they don't hurt themselves when they're trying to learn</v>

211
00:11:11.521 --> 00:11:13.170
<v Speaker 1>how to operate the chapter.</v>

212
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:16.520
<v Speaker 1>They're characterized by this terrible vulnerability and it's,</v>

213
00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:17.640
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of brutal.</v>

214
00:11:17.641 --> 00:11:18.450
<v Speaker 1>The Roman,</v>

215
00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:19.620
<v Speaker 1>because they can be heard,</v>

216
00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:22.550
<v Speaker 1>you really get sick correctly.</v>

217
00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:23.130
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

218
00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:24.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it was much worse.</v>

219
00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:25.711
<v Speaker 1>That can happen to you,</v>

220
00:11:25.711 --> 00:11:29.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't think except maybe to be this sick child,</v>

221
00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:30.540
<v Speaker 1>him or herself.</v>

222
00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:33.210
<v Speaker 1>There is much work to happen in your life.</v>

223
00:11:33.211 --> 00:11:34.890
<v Speaker 1>That shop was a great deal.</v>

224
00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:35.963
<v Speaker 1>That's rough.</v>

225
00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:38.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's lots of terrible things that can happen to you.</v>

226
00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:39.990
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's not the worst,</v>

227
00:11:39.991 --> 00:11:41.940
<v Speaker 1>but it's definitely out there day.</v>

228
00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:44.190
<v Speaker 1>It's rough and then you think,</v>

229
00:11:44.191 --> 00:11:44.730
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

230
00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:48.390
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't it be better if your chunks didn't ever have anything wrong with it?</v>

231
00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:49.621
<v Speaker 1>And then you think,</v>

232
00:11:49.621 --> 00:11:49.771
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

233
00:11:49.771 --> 00:11:52.860
<v Speaker 1>what would you have to do in order to make that the case?</v>

234
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.920
<v Speaker 1>So the all that vulnerability,</v>

235
00:11:54.921 --> 00:11:56.030
<v Speaker 1>that's painful disappeared.</v>

236
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:56.651
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

237
00:11:56.651 --> 00:11:57.880
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't be three years old</v>

238
00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:05.500
<v Speaker 1>while you were capable of taking care of yourself and your</v>

239
00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:10.353
<v Speaker 1>abilities.</v>

240
00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:13.030
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

241
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:18.030
<v Speaker 1>maybe you don't necessarily want to be free if you want them to be like 20 feet</v>

242
00:12:18.311 --> 00:12:19.144
<v Speaker 1>tall.</v>

243
00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:25.410
<v Speaker 1>So stellar human intelligence and replaceable parts.</v>

244
00:12:25.451 --> 00:12:25.760
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

245
00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.550
<v Speaker 1>well that removes a lot more.</v>

246
00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.980
<v Speaker 1>It's not much less like your son.</v>

247
00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:34.310
<v Speaker 1>It's just replaced it with a macro</v>

248
00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.890
<v Speaker 1>themes that</v>

249
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:45.400
<v Speaker 1>kind of dream.</v>

250
00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:51.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm really serious about math because we're moving very rapidly to a narrow</v>

251
00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:57.600
<v Speaker 1>artificial intelligence and robotics and God only knows what would that be part</v>

252
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
<v Speaker 1>of a dream that we'd have to replace our vulnerable selves on something and that</v>

253
00:13:03.101 --> 00:13:05.880
<v Speaker 1>would not be anymore whenever</v>

254
00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:12.670
<v Speaker 1>and wherever we are with this fear and with all the misery of the world bicycle</v>

255
00:13:12.671 --> 00:13:15.630
<v Speaker 1>that you could make a case that maybe that's not for the worst,</v>

256
00:13:15.631 --> 00:13:20.340
<v Speaker 1>but I think and so what that means is we have to accept,</v>

257
00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:26.310
<v Speaker 1>we have as part of your case for existence and you might think,</v>

258
00:13:27.151 --> 00:13:27.360
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

259
00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.111
<v Speaker 1>is it worth it?</v>

260
00:13:28.111 --> 00:13:32.200
<v Speaker 1>And I think in to respond to it with kids,</v>

261
00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:37.270
<v Speaker 1>take that person's ultimate Hazel for sex.</v>

262
00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:39.880
<v Speaker 1>You're pretty damn happy,</v>

263
00:13:39.881 --> 00:13:43.340
<v Speaker 1>but they're around under current form and so that's,</v>

264
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:44.583
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

265
00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:47.520
<v Speaker 1>that's something that's worth thinking about as far as.</v>

266
00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:50.890
<v Speaker 1>So back to meeting.</v>

267
00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:51.940
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

268
00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.480
<v Speaker 1>I spent a little time thinking about how the brain works.</v>

269
00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:07.190
<v Speaker 1>The brain structure is stranger than safety</v>

270
00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:09.940
<v Speaker 1>and no more stranger.</v>

271
00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:10.420
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

272
00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:14.740
<v Speaker 1>partly because we don't understand the relationship between consciousness,</v>

273
00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:15.803
<v Speaker 1>emphasis material,</v>

274
00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:16.663
<v Speaker 1>substrate.</v>

275
00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:21.600
<v Speaker 1>They don't really understand that are hitting the science of consciousness.</v>

276
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:26.470
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty hard for about 30 minutes now since it became somewhat respectable</v>

277
00:14:26.471 --> 00:14:28.210
<v Speaker 1>as a you're making studying,</v>

278
00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.580
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say progress.</v>

279
00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:35.680
<v Speaker 1>There's something wrong consciousness that's an intractable Mr. existence what</v>

280
00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:41.010
<v Speaker 1>its relationship to its material substrate and so that was interesting and but</v>

281
00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:47.080
<v Speaker 1>it's also interested that your post analytics is bifurcating,</v>

282
00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:49.150
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

283
00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:53.490
<v Speaker 1>You'd have two hemispheres and the medical division,</v>

284
00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:57.290
<v Speaker 1>he didn't realize that human beings before we moved around,</v>

285
00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:01.370
<v Speaker 1>so if you follow the logic of evolutionary biology,</v>

286
00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:05.780
<v Speaker 1>it reflects a duality that's built into reality itself.</v>

287
00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:07.730
<v Speaker 1>If you make the assumption that reality,</v>

288
00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:13.100
<v Speaker 1>that's the selection in the course of natural and what is selected is a</v>

289
00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:14.600
<v Speaker 1>reflection of reality,</v>

290
00:15:14.601 --> 00:15:16.840
<v Speaker 1>which is like the Darwinian truism essentially.</v>

291
00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:19.680
<v Speaker 1>You can't really deny any of that.</v>

292
00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:24.980
<v Speaker 1>It appears that has two components to it as the case.</v>

293
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:26.900
<v Speaker 1>It's an implicit case,</v>

294
00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:31.960
<v Speaker 1>mostly 12 rows like that that can be mapped out using the language of chaos and</v>

295
00:15:33.591 --> 00:15:34.190
<v Speaker 1>order.</v>

296
00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:34.590
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

297
00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:39.590
<v Speaker 1>think about the most with the idea that the world is chaos and order,</v>

298
00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:44.630
<v Speaker 1>which I think is a nice way of conceptualizing that.</v>

299
00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:44.901
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

300
00:15:44.901 --> 00:15:49.901
<v Speaker 1>one is actually more real than almost any other ideas and so if you say,</v>

301
00:15:50.751 --> 00:15:50.931
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

302
00:15:50.931 --> 00:15:51.950
<v Speaker 1>once you're approved for that,</v>

303
00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:53.140
<v Speaker 1>that will say what the fruit,</v>

304
00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:57.860
<v Speaker 1>the fact that that's how your brain discretion and not just curating also Adam</v>

305
00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:01.580
<v Speaker 1>was praying so it's deeper than just human and your left hemisphere.</v>

306
00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:02.803
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

307
00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:06.140
<v Speaker 1>this is an oversimplification because people are slightly.</v>

308
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:07.520
<v Speaker 1>People are differently.</v>

309
00:16:07.521 --> 00:16:11.910
<v Speaker 1>Lab realized that this is true with your left hemisphere to specialized or</v>

310
00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:16.930
<v Speaker 1>operation in territory that you explore and understand and it's sort of a</v>

311
00:16:17.271 --> 00:16:19.250
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian and experienced some sense.</v>

312
00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:23.690
<v Speaker 1>It's always trying to impose its current blogs on the world without having to</v>

313
00:16:23.691 --> 00:16:27.740
<v Speaker 1>change them and you don't want to change your model all the time because just to</v>

314
00:16:27.741 --> 00:16:31.040
<v Speaker 1>cognitively effortful but so you're going to take short cuts to preserve it.</v>

315
00:16:31.041 --> 00:16:34.070
<v Speaker 1>If you can't because you put a lot of work into your damn mall.</v>

316
00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:37.500
<v Speaker 1>Here's the first mistake,</v>

317
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:39.510
<v Speaker 1>but it does make you kind of repeat it.</v>

318
00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm able to admit to,</v>

319
00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:46.700
<v Speaker 1>or a procedural error that seems to be a left hemisphere function is primarily</v>

320
00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:51.340
<v Speaker 1>associated with articulate speech and and,</v>

321
00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:52.240
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

322
00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:56.360
<v Speaker 1>and operation in the known explored character.</v>

323
00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:57.850
<v Speaker 1>Now you know,</v>

324
00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:00.140
<v Speaker 1>if you think about the tribal landscape,</v>

325
00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:01.013
<v Speaker 1>might think,</v>

326
00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:02.020
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

327
00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:02.230
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

328
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:02.780
<v Speaker 1>what was the,</v>

329
00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:06.040
<v Speaker 1>how was the world constituted for much of our evolutionary history.</v>

330
00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:07.340
<v Speaker 1>You can kind of think of it this way,</v>

331
00:17:07.341 --> 00:17:10.790
<v Speaker 1>is that there was a fire and would center things because we'd been hanging</v>

332
00:17:10.791 --> 00:17:14.750
<v Speaker 1>around campfires for something on the order of two years and the campfire,</v>

333
00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:16.580
<v Speaker 1>the dark and said big,</v>

334
00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:16.910
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

335
00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:19.520
<v Speaker 1>Then all the terrible things that lived at the darkness that we're more than</v>

336
00:17:19.521 --> 00:17:20.470
<v Speaker 1>happy to eat you.</v>

337
00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:22.150
<v Speaker 1>And so there was no.</v>

338
00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:27.460
<v Speaker 1>There was the fire as the center and the place that the fire shot on light on.</v>

339
00:17:27.801 --> 00:17:32.780
<v Speaker 1>And then there was the dark perimeter beyond that where the predators lit up and</v>

340
00:17:32.781 --> 00:17:34.400
<v Speaker 1>you can go out into the dark perimeter.</v>

341
00:17:34.401 --> 00:17:37.040
<v Speaker 1>You can bring something of value,</v>

342
00:17:37.041 --> 00:17:38.330
<v Speaker 1>but it's very dangerous team.</v>

343
00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.010
<v Speaker 1>So that was really the landscape of human based.</v>

344
00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:45.410
<v Speaker 1>Its whole base of you to your family and your tribe.</v>

345
00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:48.340
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the periphery that's from that.</v>

346
00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:51.780
<v Speaker 1>You can think about that as explored territory and unexplored territory.</v>

347
00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:53.610
<v Speaker 1>That's a good way of conceptualizing it.</v>

348
00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:58.910
<v Speaker 1>And that's the that dad really is explored territory and unexplored territory.</v>

349
00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:02.540
<v Speaker 1>Your spirit functions in the filmmaking,</v>

350
00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:03.900
<v Speaker 1>unexplored territory,</v>

351
00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:07.200
<v Speaker 1>and your right hemisphere functions into domain,</v>

352
00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:08.500
<v Speaker 1>unexplored territory.</v>

353
00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:12.480
<v Speaker 1>What that means is you don't like it when your right hemisphere turns off</v>

354
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:16.540
<v Speaker 1>because unexplored territory is a place where things are.</v>

355
00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:18.450
<v Speaker 1>And maybe even a horror movie now,</v>

356
00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:23.520
<v Speaker 1>just learn would have your right hemisphere through just to see what that's</v>

357
00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:24.620
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

358
00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:25.230
<v Speaker 1>You could,</v>

359
00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:29.110
<v Speaker 1>you could experiment with it if you can explore it and maybe you could fortify</v>

360
00:18:29.111 --> 00:18:31.700
<v Speaker 1>yourself with somebody because that's what people do when they will see</v>

361
00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:33.400
<v Speaker 1>thrillers are strangers.</v>

362
00:18:33.401 --> 00:18:37.950
<v Speaker 1>Why the hell would you see like this stairs,</v>

363
00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:40.000
<v Speaker 1>20 bucks it just strip it out,</v>

364
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:43.943
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

365
00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:45.070
<v Speaker 1>We'll do that.</v>

366
00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:46.043
<v Speaker 1>We'll do that.</v>

367
00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:50.490
<v Speaker 1>They're doing what I mentioned at the beginning of this talk was there.</v>

368
00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:52.790
<v Speaker 1>They're toying with their own vulnerability,</v>

369
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:53.731
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

370
00:18:53.731 --> 00:18:54.730
<v Speaker 1>And they're attempting to.</v>

371
00:18:55.610 --> 00:19:00.610
<v Speaker 1>We're watching narratives of adventure or is we're planning with our</v>

372
00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:02.551
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability.</v>

373
00:19:02.551 --> 00:19:03.860
<v Speaker 1>When you rollercoasters,</v>

374
00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:07.730
<v Speaker 1>you know we do that whenever we push yourself off the edge and flirt with</v>

375
00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:10.380
<v Speaker 1>potassium were toying with her.</v>

376
00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:13.920
<v Speaker 1>We're also pointing with the big.</v>

377
00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:19.260
<v Speaker 1>We're toying with our ability to move out into uncharted territory and to</v>

378
00:19:19.261 --> 00:19:20.094
<v Speaker 1>prevail,</v>

379
00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:21.520
<v Speaker 1>and here's a.</v>

380
00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:22.230
<v Speaker 1>here's a thought.</v>

381
00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:23.063
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

382
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:25.490
<v Speaker 1>you might want to stay in explored characteristics.</v>

383
00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:26.610
<v Speaker 1>That's where it's safe.</v>

384
00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:31.580
<v Speaker 1>The problem with that is that explored I unexplored territory.</v>

385
00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:32.443
<v Speaker 1>Various is saying,</v>

386
00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:35.920
<v Speaker 1>I can just run down a date because then like the dragon will.</v>

387
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.790
<v Speaker 1>You would have a pdf that's food as strategy,</v>

388
00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:42.000
<v Speaker 1>but if you really want to compare yourself to the world or the world,</v>

389
00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:43.680
<v Speaker 1>you don't just stay where you're comfortable.</v>

390
00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:47.670
<v Speaker 1>You stay where you're comfortable enough going to die,</v>

391
00:19:47.671 --> 00:19:52.460
<v Speaker 1>but you put one foot out where you don't understand and then you balance</v>

392
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:55.740
<v Speaker 1>yourself there and you stay there as much as you possibly can,</v>

393
00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:58.050
<v Speaker 1>and that's actually what meaning is.</v>

394
00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:03.530
<v Speaker 1>And I think that I think we know enough about brain function actually say that</v>

395
00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:06.330
<v Speaker 1>the sense of meaning that envelops you when you're,</v>

396
00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:08.520
<v Speaker 1>when you're occupied property of your life,</v>

397
00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:11.400
<v Speaker 1>is a neurophysiological signal that you have.</v>

398
00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:15.870
<v Speaker 1>The fundamental constituent elements of reality in proper balance and you think,</v>

399
00:20:15.871 --> 00:20:16.111
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

400
00:20:16.111 --> 00:20:17.730
<v Speaker 1>why would that be the case?</v>

401
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:18.271
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

402
00:20:18.271 --> 00:20:19.650
<v Speaker 1>let's be hard to get it right.</v>

403
00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:22.350
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to get old mythological and religious about this.</v>

404
00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:23.203
<v Speaker 1>Let's be Africa.</v>

405
00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:25.990
<v Speaker 1>We're going to stay in there for materialistic.</v>

406
00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:26.873
<v Speaker 1>Don't make.</v>

407
00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:28.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're an evolved creature.</v>

408
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:31.120
<v Speaker 1>You're evolved for the actual world.</v>

409
00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:33.560
<v Speaker 1>The actual world is made up of things you don't want to.</v>

410
00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:34.350
<v Speaker 1>Things you don't know.</v>

411
00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:36.870
<v Speaker 1>A lot of things you don't know are pretty dangerous.</v>

412
00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:39.780
<v Speaker 1>Now you can stay where everything is comfortable.</v>

413
00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.820
<v Speaker 1>You can stay inside the walls,</v>

414
00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:45.030
<v Speaker 1>but that's not very good strategy because the things that are outside of the</v>

415
00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:47.330
<v Speaker 1>wall can pick them up inside walls.</v>

416
00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:48.430
<v Speaker 1>That's the state.</v>

417
00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:48.930
<v Speaker 1>Regardless.</v>

418
00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:52.630
<v Speaker 1>That's that's why in paradise there's a state,</v>

419
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:55.650
<v Speaker 1>if they fall on paradise city,</v>

420
00:20:55.680 --> 00:21:00.600
<v Speaker 1>which is are full of garden just speaks to what the health of the state and then</v>

421
00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:03.340
<v Speaker 1>there's no making a walled garden snake.</v>

422
00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:07.510
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is that not only you have to be able to live with the</v>

423
00:21:07.511 --> 00:21:07.871
<v Speaker 1>garden,</v>

424
00:21:07.871 --> 00:21:10.600
<v Speaker 1>you bloody well better be able to deal with the snakes.</v>

425
00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:14.940
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that's what you should practice and would that mean that</v>

426
00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:19.720
<v Speaker 1>you know that and when you feel that things are aligned with your,</v>

427
00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:22.740
<v Speaker 1>when you're doing things that are meaningful and engaging,</v>

428
00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.920
<v Speaker 1>what that means is that you've got the balance between chaos and order,</v>

429
00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:26.650
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

430
00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:30.340
<v Speaker 1>And that means that you're secure at the same time you're extending your</v>

431
00:21:30.341 --> 00:21:31.180
<v Speaker 1>confidence.</v>

432
00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:32.531
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>

433
00:21:32.531 --> 00:21:34.210
<v Speaker 1>what is that real answer is,</v>

434
00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:35.020
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

435
00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:36.940
<v Speaker 1>how about survival is that's real.</v>

436
00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:40.540
<v Speaker 1>How about the expansion of the human capacity to survive?</v>

437
00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.670
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything more real than that?</v>

438
00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:43.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

439
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:45.010
<v Speaker 1>not from a Darwinian perspective.</v>

440
00:21:45.011 --> 00:21:45.844
<v Speaker 1>There is.</v>

441
00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:49.830
<v Speaker 1>And it could easily be that there isn't anything more real then what's rebuild</v>

442
00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.370
<v Speaker 1>from a therapy perspective.</v>

443
00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:56.800
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say that the sense of being an arrogant guy,</v>

444
00:21:57.370 --> 00:21:58.790
<v Speaker 1>and it's interesting too,</v>

445
00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:03.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's no shortage of religious speculation on the depth of meaning.</v>

446
00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:08.590
<v Speaker 1>I'll look at a particular symbol for this for the sake of illustration.</v>

447
00:22:08.591 --> 00:22:09.790
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

448
00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.200
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason,</v>

449
00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:12.780
<v Speaker 1>very mysterious reason,</v>

450
00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:16.940
<v Speaker 1>the image of the crucifixion has transfixed the van,</v>

451
00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:20.070
<v Speaker 1>the imagination of humankind for 2000 years.</v>

452
00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:23.530
<v Speaker 1>Now it's not obvious why,</v>

453
00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:24.011
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

454
00:22:24.011 --> 00:22:29.011
<v Speaker 1>it's quite obvious why it's a and to put a symbol like that which is simple,</v>

455
00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.490
<v Speaker 1>most painful death would be trading something like that.</v>

456
00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.830
<v Speaker 1>To put that in angels,</v>

457
00:22:35.831 --> 00:22:40.831
<v Speaker 1>that took like 300 years to build something with your ability to close,</v>

458
00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:44.040
<v Speaker 1>they knew those things were going to take 300 years to build.</v>

459
00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:45.440
<v Speaker 1>It was like no moon shop,</v>

460
00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:46.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

461
00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:46.843
<v Speaker 1>was no joke.</v>

462
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:50.590
<v Speaker 1>Those things took a lot of work and a lot of resources and they're all built to</v>

463
00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:54.330
<v Speaker 1>encapsulate this symbol is horrific symbol.</v>

464
00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:54.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

465
00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:56.170
<v Speaker 1>what the hell's going on there?</v>

466
00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:57.490
<v Speaker 1>What if you could,</v>

467
00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.100
<v Speaker 1>if you look at it from a detached a bit and think,</v>

468
00:23:00.101 --> 00:23:00.221
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

469
00:23:00.221 --> 00:23:05.020
<v Speaker 1>there's mystery and there's an idea.</v>

470
00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:10.030
<v Speaker 1>There's a deep fear that the idea is that the fundamental adaptive pattern is</v>

471
00:23:12.341 --> 00:23:17.341
<v Speaker 1>that which is is that which is expressed in the radical acceptance of</v>

472
00:23:17.921 --> 00:23:22.070
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability and the level of the crucifixion represents absolutely.</v>

473
00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:26.860
<v Speaker 1>The Passion story represents and the reason it's a typical story independent of</v>

474
00:23:26.861 --> 00:23:28.330
<v Speaker 1>its religious significance,</v>

475
00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:29.470
<v Speaker 1>don't have not speaking.</v>

476
00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:34.490
<v Speaker 1>Then physically speaking as a psychologist is that there was an idea and the</v>

477
00:23:34.691 --> 00:23:38.490
<v Speaker 1>idea is that if you strip away everything from life,</v>

478
00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:43.300
<v Speaker 1>you're living with the fact that your vulnerability as an Oracle baiting and the</v>

479
00:23:43.301 --> 00:23:44.630
<v Speaker 1>fact that you're subjugating,</v>

480
00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:48.080
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

481
00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:49.820
<v Speaker 1>the question is what do you do with that?</v>

482
00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.790
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is the answer that's expressed by that symbolism.</v>

483
00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:57.880
<v Speaker 1>You accept him as radically and completely as you can and the consequences that</v>

484
00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:03.190
<v Speaker 1>can transcend that and all of our cultural work that surrounds that symbol has</v>

485
00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:06.260
<v Speaker 1>to bring that idea</v>

486
00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:12.110
<v Speaker 1>up into something resembling articulated consciousness.</v>

487
00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:13.071
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

488
00:24:13.071 --> 00:24:15.980
<v Speaker 1>and we spent all those thousands of years</v>

489
00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:21.350
<v Speaker 1>similar being possessed by that symbol in an attempt to try to actually</v>

490
00:24:21.351 --> 00:24:24.020
<v Speaker 1>understand what it means and that's what it means.</v>

491
00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:29.260
<v Speaker 1>It means that your best is to accept you crucified preconditions of existence</v>

492
00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:35.150
<v Speaker 1>and to move forward.</v>

493
00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:38.810
<v Speaker 1>Appeal towards the best thing that you could envision.</v>

494
00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:40.073
<v Speaker 1>Regardless.</v>

495
00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:43.920
<v Speaker 1>I think that that is.</v>

496
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000
<v Speaker 1>I do believe that an APP has never been expressed in another Christian music</v>

497
00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:55.460
<v Speaker 1>because it's such a well known representation.</v>

498
00:24:56.680 --> 00:25:01.680
<v Speaker 1>It's still something that's part of our culture that everyone has to here.</v>

499
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:05.730
<v Speaker 1>But you see those sorts of ideas expressed in,</v>

500
00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:10.010
<v Speaker 1>in great stories from traditional models of the world,</v>

501
00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:11.240
<v Speaker 1>and it's the story.</v>

502
00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:13.960
<v Speaker 1>It's the story of a radical hero's language say,</v>

503
00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:15.470
<v Speaker 1>and routing and encouraged,</v>

504
00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:17.300
<v Speaker 1>and that's the courage to</v>

505
00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:22.160
<v Speaker 1>dare to live in the property world,</v>

506
00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:23.293
<v Speaker 1>which you</v>

507
00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:25.010
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

508
00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:29.540
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you see people who are dying and they look like good people because</v>

509
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:31.250
<v Speaker 1>they're not doing anything wrong.</v>

510
00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:34.550
<v Speaker 1>You don't even have a conception that things might be awesome.</v>

511
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:35.833
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

512
00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:38.830
<v Speaker 1>when you have good number,</v>

513
00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:40.370
<v Speaker 1>those two issues in some senses,</v>

514
00:25:40.371 --> 00:25:42.740
<v Speaker 1>to be the unconscious,</v>

515
00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:43.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

516
00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:44.670
<v Speaker 1>you're not a good person,</v>

517
00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:45.583
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

518
00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:51.690
<v Speaker 1>maybe until you actually practice in Arabic so that you've got some tea and then</v>

519
00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:55.630
<v Speaker 1>decided that despite that your.</v>

520
00:25:56.260 --> 00:26:00.170
<v Speaker 1>Despite that and despite the different brutality in the world and you're going</v>

521
00:26:00.171 --> 00:26:05.171
<v Speaker 1>to act as an agent in the world who is devoted at every level that's possible</v>

522
00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:07.240
<v Speaker 1>towards making things better of it.</v>

523
00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:08.463
<v Speaker 1>Worse</v>

524
00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:19.913
<v Speaker 1>asking</v>

525
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:21.690
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>

526
00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:22.610
<v Speaker 1>are you ready?</v>

527
00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:24.643
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

528
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:33.090
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

529
00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:33.923
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

530
00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:35.400
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean by that?</v>

531
00:26:35.401 --> 00:26:38.940
<v Speaker 1>Exactly that what you mean by that.</v>

532
00:26:38.941 --> 00:26:40.590
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing that I meant like that.</v>

533
00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:43.080
<v Speaker 1>And then the next.</v>

534
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:48.230
<v Speaker 1>I think is what sort of trap or exactly when you will laugh about them,</v>

535
00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:49.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

536
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:54.830
<v Speaker 1>Because that's interesting because the trap in that statement is it's there.</v>

537
00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:58.490
<v Speaker 1>It's not obvious exactly what it is.</v>

538
00:26:58.491 --> 00:26:59.550
<v Speaker 1>You started with something like,</v>

539
00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:00.740
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

540
00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:02.450
<v Speaker 1>here's formulate questions,</v>

541
00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:07.740
<v Speaker 1>here's a set of potential formulate answers and it's under one of those or be</v>

542
00:27:07.741 --> 00:27:08.574
<v Speaker 1>like answers.</v>

543
00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:09.610
<v Speaker 1>Here's a boss.</v>

544
00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:11.910
<v Speaker 1>I can ignore you and walk away,</v>

545
00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:25.810
<v Speaker 1>and so I was thinking now I'm just thinking about that.</v>

546
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:29.770
<v Speaker 1>There's always the possibility that I'm not answering it because I</v>

547
00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:32.253
<v Speaker 1>take</v>

548
00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:36.220
<v Speaker 1>it seriously because I</v>

549
00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:39.393
<v Speaker 1>know</v>

550
00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:41.343
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

551
00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:43.023
<v Speaker 1>That's</v>

552
00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:48.790
<v Speaker 1>important to answer that question for a long period of time.</v>

553
00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:51.280
<v Speaker 1>If you want to know the answer to that.</v>

554
00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:56.310
<v Speaker 1>If you want to know that I have a lecture series 40 hours long and you listen to</v>

555
00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:03.530
<v Speaker 1>that because that large constantly requires 52 hours if you record it.</v>

556
00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:07.620
<v Speaker 1>Do you want an answer?</v>

557
00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:08.350
<v Speaker 1>That question?</v>

558
00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:10.180
<v Speaker 1>Here's a 52 hour</v>

559
00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:15.670
<v Speaker 1>to have a serious answer.</v>

560
00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:30.380
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about that.</v>

561
00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:37.340
<v Speaker 1>I think I just don't mind it a little bit in this discussion that we've already</v>

562
00:28:37.341 --> 00:28:39.610
<v Speaker 1>had it so hard to get small.</v>

563
00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:41.183
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

564
00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:44.220
<v Speaker 1>so let's say it's a question of</v>

565
00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:49.550
<v Speaker 1>what you might put your faith and let's say you put your faith in something</v>

566
00:28:49.551 --> 00:28:53.150
<v Speaker 1>because you don't know everything and so he starting point and I think that's</v>

567
00:28:53.151 --> 00:28:57.470
<v Speaker 1>actually true because you're fundamentally eight different because you don't</v>

568
00:28:57.471 --> 00:28:58.304
<v Speaker 1>know everything.</v>

569
00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:03.380
<v Speaker 1>Then you have to ask as if some things are fundamentally true or you just can't</v>

570
00:29:03.381 --> 00:29:04.214
<v Speaker 1>be many.</v>

571
00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:05.073
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

572
00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:06.360
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

573
00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:12.060
<v Speaker 1>So then the question might be that some things are fundamentally true in order</v>

574
00:29:12.591 --> 00:29:15.130
<v Speaker 1>to exist at a in the world looking to see</v>

575
00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:21.630
<v Speaker 1>what are the things that you should act as the Afar fundamentally true.</v>

576
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:22.341
<v Speaker 1>And I can say,</v>

577
00:29:22.341 --> 00:29:23.174
<v Speaker 1>well</v>

578
00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:28.010
<v Speaker 1>I take the attitude that I've laid out with regards to my three year old son is</v>

579
00:29:28.011 --> 00:29:28.930
<v Speaker 1>a good example of that.</v>

580
00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:29.530
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

581
00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:33.980
<v Speaker 1>you might start by hypothesizing that the fact that people exist as a good thing</v>

582
00:29:33.981 --> 00:29:36.620
<v Speaker 1>rather than a bad thing and you know,</v>

583
00:29:36.621 --> 00:29:37.131
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>

584
00:29:37.131 --> 00:29:38.180
<v Speaker 1>well that's all instance</v>

585
00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:43.440
<v Speaker 1>about a month and ago within philosopher from South Africa</v>

586
00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:46.870
<v Speaker 1>and he wrote a book,</v>

587
00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:50.400
<v Speaker 1>the kind of person I can't remember unfortunately,</v>

588
00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:54.430
<v Speaker 1>but his basic presupposition and he lays this out,</v>

589
00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:56.760
<v Speaker 1>but it hasn't been very large number of followers,</v>

590
00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:00.070
<v Speaker 1>absolutely catastrophic,</v>

591
00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:02.760
<v Speaker 1>horrific and miserable and it would be better if</v>

592
00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.970
<v Speaker 1>you think that's pretty useful,</v>

593
00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:13.480
<v Speaker 1>but he actually thinks that we're all able to bring someone into the world,</v>

594
00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:14.483
<v Speaker 1>not to.</v>

595
00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:15.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

596
00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:18.980
<v Speaker 1>you haven't taken any sort of argument with a certain degree of seriousness</v>

597
00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:23.400
<v Speaker 1>because I know that when women are thinking about having children and not,</v>

598
00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:29.580
<v Speaker 1>the reason they decided not to express is that they don't want to bring a child</v>

599
00:30:30.011 --> 00:30:33.440
<v Speaker 1>into a world like this and it's usually because they have some mouse.</v>

600
00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:34.330
<v Speaker 1>This apprehension,</v>

601
00:30:34.331 --> 00:30:37.090
<v Speaker 1>but now it's worse than any other time in history.</v>

602
00:30:37.091 --> 00:30:42.020
<v Speaker 1>Which is so absolutely not true that this is just a miracle that you can think</v>

603
00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:51.983
<v Speaker 1>serious.</v>

604
00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:53.970
<v Speaker 1>The census.</v>

605
00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:57.790
<v Speaker 1>You bring somebody into the world that they're going to suffer and die.</v>

606
00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:02.510
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps something like retreats</v>

607
00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:06.010
<v Speaker 1>being itself apart,</v>

608
00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:07.040
<v Speaker 1>so much suffering.</v>

609
00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:08.280
<v Speaker 1>It's actually not</v>

610
00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:10.620
<v Speaker 1>fair.</v>

611
00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:11.453
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

612
00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:17.420
<v Speaker 1>It was two things.</v>

613
00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:22.490
<v Speaker 1>One is that if you accept that you don't stop there,</v>

614
00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:23.840
<v Speaker 1>you can't just say,</v>

615
00:31:23.841 --> 00:31:24.081
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

616
00:31:24.081 --> 00:31:28.960
<v Speaker 1>I think being is unjustifiable and so we shouldn't have any more bs.</v>

617
00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:30.620
<v Speaker 1>Argument doesn't stop there.</v>

618
00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:31.190
<v Speaker 1>The argument,</v>

619
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:36.190
<v Speaker 1>it's to be unjust celebrating and that makes me bitter and angry and vengeful</v>

620
00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:42.500
<v Speaker 1>and destructive and then I take my revenge on the world,</v>

621
00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:47.120
<v Speaker 1>and so when you look at the motivation of people who these terrible things in</v>

622
00:31:47.121 --> 00:31:47.930
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

623
00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:49.610
<v Speaker 1>they start with a presupposition.</v>

624
00:31:49.611 --> 00:31:54.611
<v Speaker 1>That being is is intrinsically feedback and then proper role is to do something</v>

625
00:31:57.410 --> 00:32:02.410
<v Speaker 1>to take advantage of that and that's like a bad argument because it's being as</v>

626
00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:03.740
<v Speaker 1>expensive to be bad,</v>

627
00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:08.450
<v Speaker 1>maybe get a hell of a lot worse because of what you're doing is not a solution.</v>

628
00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:11.530
<v Speaker 1>So I think that</v>

629
00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:18.980
<v Speaker 1>I would also say the problem with that lack of argumentation is that it actually</v>

630
00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:24.040
<v Speaker 1>does underestimate seriously underestimate him with regards to the counseling,</v>

631
00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:27.670
<v Speaker 1>the grandeur Europe,</v>

632
00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:28.940
<v Speaker 1>the human spirit.</v>

633
00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:33.000
<v Speaker 1>Because I do think that white is treasure,</v>

634
00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:34.940
<v Speaker 1>can you just buy my level?</v>

635
00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:40.570
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the facts of the matter rush that human beings are so remarkable</v>

636
00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:47.690
<v Speaker 1>that they can actually continue with that and make it work.</v>

637
00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:50.760
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say as I said,</v>

638
00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:53.420
<v Speaker 1>get the hell out of bed in the morning despite,</v>

639
00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:53.761
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

640
00:32:53.761 --> 00:32:57.500
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of people in this audience who are carrying some pretty vicious</v>

641
00:32:57.501 --> 00:33:02.501
<v Speaker 1>burgers maybe in one or two per 10 different ways,</v>

642
00:33:02.931 --> 00:33:03.151
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

643
00:33:03.151 --> 00:33:07.520
<v Speaker 1>because lots of people and you will be.</v>

644
00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:08.393
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

645
00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:18.440
<v Speaker 1>if you're not open profitability that you have a first degree relative can start</v>

646
00:33:18.441 --> 00:33:20.150
<v Speaker 1>something fairly serious wrong with it.</v>

647
00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:21.230
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty damn high.</v>

648
00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:25.510
<v Speaker 1>And if you happen to be one of those periods in life where that is happening,</v>

649
00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:30.820
<v Speaker 1>make more power to you because you don't make assumptions.</v>

650
00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:32.403
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

651
00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:35.060
<v Speaker 1>and still,</v>

652
00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:37.910
<v Speaker 1>despite that fact you're getting,</v>

653
00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:39.020
<v Speaker 1>how often do you go to work?</v>

654
00:33:39.021 --> 00:33:41.150
<v Speaker 1>And most of you are miserable.</v>

655
00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:44.030
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to make everything worse as a consequence.</v>

656
00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:46.310
<v Speaker 1>So like we need to be.</v>

657
00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:48.353
<v Speaker 1>Because</v>

658
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.050
<v Speaker 1>if you go into a shop or a liberal diners,</v>

659
00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:57.450
<v Speaker 1>say you go there and get a cup of coffee and fresh orange juice,</v>

660
00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:03.300
<v Speaker 1>get some that are part of one side versus the left writing,</v>

661
00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:07.050
<v Speaker 1>so it means that they've managed to transcend that tracks for your very</v>

662
00:34:07.051 --> 00:34:07.884
<v Speaker 1>existence</v>

663
00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:25.810
<v Speaker 1>when they go unnoticed and I don't make sure</v>

664
00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:29.600
<v Speaker 1>you understand what</v>

665
00:34:31.330 --> 00:34:32.740
<v Speaker 1>people truly bear.</v>

666
00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:37.250
<v Speaker 1>If you opened your eyes to that and you see them through a simple glance of all</v>

667
00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:38.820
<v Speaker 1>the you accept that suffering,</v>

668
00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:39.950
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

669
00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:44.330
<v Speaker 1>Then the fact that someone just pleasant to you when you go to the diner in the</v>

670
00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:49.360
<v Speaker 1>morning and ask for a cup of coffee in his mirror and I really think that isn't</v>

671
00:34:50.471 --> 00:34:51.304
<v Speaker 1>the case.</v>

672
00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:56.440
<v Speaker 1>I also think that that's an antidote to the sorts of toxic ideas in our society,</v>

673
00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:00.920
<v Speaker 1>like the fact that the planet will be better off.</v>

674
00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:01.950
<v Speaker 1>There weren't so many people.</v>

675
00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:06.400
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the last thing that you would want.</v>

676
00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:08.580
<v Speaker 1>Anyone who's hand was near the nuclear button to,</v>

677
00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:09.763
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

678
00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:14.210
<v Speaker 1>or somehow was cancer on the face of the planet and that our very existence is</v>

679
00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:19.400
<v Speaker 1>indication of our toxicity because of all you can have a little sympathy for</v>

680
00:35:19.401 --> 00:35:20.234
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>

681
00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:20.741
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

682
00:35:20.741 --> 00:35:22.490
<v Speaker 1>we're the only creatures on earth.</v>

683
00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:27.200
<v Speaker 1>The struggle forward under incredible psychological distress APP.</v>

684
00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:31.580
<v Speaker 1>It's built right into the fabric of our and given that</v>

685
00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:36.310
<v Speaker 1>we did pretty damn well.</v>

686
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:39.230
<v Speaker 1>People don't,</v>

687
00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:40.620
<v Speaker 1>and we're doing,</v>

688
00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:45.060
<v Speaker 1>we're doing everything we can say as far creatures to make things better rather</v>

689
00:35:45.061 --> 00:35:45.680
<v Speaker 1>than worse.</v>

690
00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:46.640
<v Speaker 1>And you can tell about,</v>

691
00:35:46.641 --> 00:35:48.910
<v Speaker 1>because I came here today,</v>

692
00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:53.520
<v Speaker 1>this is a pretty nice place to trees</v>

693
00:35:56.290 --> 00:35:57.123
<v Speaker 2>no</v>

694
00:35:58.120 --> 00:35:59.010
<v Speaker 1>to like trees</v>

695
00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:03.903
<v Speaker 1>and you don't care.</v>

696
00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:05.260
<v Speaker 1>And most of our cities,</v>

697
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:06.950
<v Speaker 1>especially in North America,</v>

698
00:36:06.951 --> 00:36:07.784
<v Speaker 1>Europe,</v>

699
00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:09.413
<v Speaker 1>here's</v>

700
00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:17.183
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>

701
00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:19.230
<v Speaker 1>no water,</v>

702
00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:21.073
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

703
00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:23.360
<v Speaker 1>you have a.</v>

704
00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:31.600
<v Speaker 1>You can go off the street.</v>

705
00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:33.270
<v Speaker 1>No one kills even takes you all.</v>

706
00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:35.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm always happy.</v>

707
00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:44.490
<v Speaker 1>That is the baseline condition.</v>

708
00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:45.353
<v Speaker 1>Keep an</v>

709
00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:53.940
<v Speaker 1>no easily societies to generate the absolute mayhem and how often that happens.</v>

710
00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:57.293
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>

711
00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:00.720
<v Speaker 1>still know to remind</v>

712
00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:03.343
<v Speaker 1>me</v>

713
00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:21.510
<v Speaker 1>there's not going to get it to as well.</v>

714
00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:27.410
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

715
00:37:30.930 --> 00:37:31.763
<v Speaker 1>we'll use,</v>

716
00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:32.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

717
00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:37.400
<v Speaker 1>Because if it's cash for coffee,</v>

718
00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:44.530
<v Speaker 1>how fragile systems are in general in every moment where that has been</v>

719
00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:45.050
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>

720
00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:50.050
<v Speaker 1>it's actually a kind of miraculous human spirit and one of the things I would</v>

721
00:37:51.261 --> 00:37:54.450
<v Speaker 1>say is we have a pretty decent website,</v>

722
00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:57.550
<v Speaker 1>like our society is pretty damn civilized.</v>

723
00:37:58.310 --> 00:38:02.640
<v Speaker 1>I know their flaws and resources that are given are distributed,</v>

724
00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:03.280
<v Speaker 1>will be,</v>

725
00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:07.490
<v Speaker 1>and that's obviously caused a certain amount of trouble,</v>

726
00:38:07.491 --> 00:38:10.220
<v Speaker 1>but it can be a hell of a lot worse than the extent.</v>

727
00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:13.190
<v Speaker 1>We're pretty damn fortunate that things are good.</v>

728
00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:17.990
<v Speaker 1>You can take a certain amount of credit for that because the reason they're good</v>

729
00:38:18.130 --> 00:38:22.990
<v Speaker 1>is most of you are pretty trustworthy and so how have</v>

730
00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:28.340
<v Speaker 1>you seen around the world and in history,</v>

731
00:38:28.341 --> 00:38:33.150
<v Speaker 1>there's so many corrupt states and once the society is at the state and that</v>

732
00:38:33.151 --> 00:38:34.380
<v Speaker 1>will not be individually level.</v>

733
00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:39.160
<v Speaker 1>The baseline interaction between people is predicated on trust on virtually</v>

734
00:38:39.161 --> 00:38:42.190
<v Speaker 1>impossible to figure out how it gets going.</v>

735
00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:46.660
<v Speaker 1>You can't trust anyone around you and how do you start trusting people?</v>

736
00:38:46.890 --> 00:38:47.910
<v Speaker 1>It just never seen.</v>

737
00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:51.840
<v Speaker 1>It's just something that doesn't seem to ever get off the ground fall</v>

738
00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:56.060
<v Speaker 1>interaction in the west and increasingly I would say the rest of the world that</v>

739
00:38:56.110 --> 00:38:58.800
<v Speaker 1>the world is actually one of the trust.</v>

740
00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:00.550
<v Speaker 1>I can give you an example of this.</v>

741
00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:01.483
<v Speaker 1>This is a small,</v>

742
00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:02.993
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

743
00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:07.640
<v Speaker 1>I think I've told this story was in a chapter I cut out at 12 olds,</v>

744
00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:10.620
<v Speaker 1>but it will be in the next</v>

745
00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:19.421
<v Speaker 1>20 years ago.</v>

746
00:39:19.421 --> 00:39:22.180
<v Speaker 1>And he drove in the car.</v>

747
00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:24.130
<v Speaker 1>It's a little cadillac and a</v>

748
00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:31.120
<v Speaker 1>rainstorm and hit the brakes and the car into a wall right on the corner.</v>

749
00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:34.193
<v Speaker 1>It's about,</v>

750
00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:38.540
<v Speaker 1>because it takes the bumper panel and</v>

751
00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:41.160
<v Speaker 1>the closing thing,</v>

752
00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:06.450
<v Speaker 1>he was all embarrassed.</v>

753
00:40:11.930 --> 00:40:15.370
<v Speaker 1>I decided to get the car fixed or something,</v>

754
00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:19.510
<v Speaker 1>if it's like worth more than what we can do that.</v>

755
00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:21.560
<v Speaker 1>And so I went online because,</v>

756
00:40:21.561 --> 00:40:22.394
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

757
00:40:22.450 --> 00:40:23.450
<v Speaker 1>people want to fix your car.</v>

758
00:40:23.451 --> 00:40:25.620
<v Speaker 1>You can go online if you could describe it.</v>

759
00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:27.790
<v Speaker 1>A partner in geography result for</v>

760
00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:32.510
<v Speaker 1>a good deal.</v>

761
00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:36.020
<v Speaker 1>So I waited,</v>

762
00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:39.140
<v Speaker 1>did this guy from Mississippi,</v>

763
00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:41.140
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

764
00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:46.200
<v Speaker 1>I kept that part and so we communicate by email and he said he wanted some</v>

765
00:40:47.841 --> 00:40:52.841
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous price for $160 for the whole assembly and it's going to ship it,</v>

766
00:40:53.151 --> 00:40:53.610
<v Speaker 1>recharges,</v>

767
00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:58.610
<v Speaker 1>brings to that deal and I wouldn't be so,</v>

768
00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:01.340
<v Speaker 1>so that was fine and I</v>

769
00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:10.060
<v Speaker 1>just went over to the yard and I found out that there's a plastic piece on the</v>

770
00:41:10.341 --> 00:41:13.700
<v Speaker 1>side and it has the scratching and I thought,</v>

771
00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:14.931
<v Speaker 1>that's so amazing.</v>

772
00:41:14.931 --> 00:41:17.110
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're a geography the Mississippi,</v>

773
00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:20.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm never going to get you don't know who they are and you already gave me a</v>

774
00:41:20.621 --> 00:41:23.340
<v Speaker 1>pretty good deal on this part yet.</v>

775
00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:25.010
<v Speaker 1>You caught me scratch.</v>

776
00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:27.621
<v Speaker 1>Well thank you.</v>

777
00:41:27.621 --> 00:41:28.454
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>

778
00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:29.900
<v Speaker 1>Very good.</v>

779
00:41:30.970 --> 00:41:34.130
<v Speaker 1>And then it extended scratch.</v>

780
00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:34.520
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

781
00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:36.240
<v Speaker 1>Scraps likes to be on the oven.</v>

782
00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:38.460
<v Speaker 1>He called me again about 15 minutes later.</v>

783
00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:40.160
<v Speaker 1>Wait a sec if you want.</v>

784
00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:42.060
<v Speaker 1>Did you want the bumper?</v>

785
00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:43.663
<v Speaker 1>The Lights?</v>

786
00:41:43.930 --> 00:41:44.361
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

787
00:41:44.361 --> 00:41:46.220
<v Speaker 1>well I specified that in,</v>

788
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:46.741
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

789
00:41:46.741 --> 00:41:47.660
<v Speaker 1>my original request.</v>

790
00:41:47.661 --> 00:41:48.650
<v Speaker 1>I want to propose assembly 70.</v>

791
00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:52.040
<v Speaker 1>It was just for the,</v>

792
00:41:52.070 --> 00:41:52.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

793
00:41:52.450 --> 00:41:53.180
<v Speaker 1>the barrier,</v>

794
00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:56.250
<v Speaker 1>their shell because we already made the deal,</v>

795
00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:57.830
<v Speaker 1>honor and I thought,</v>

796
00:41:58.380 --> 00:41:58.720
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>

797
00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:00.070
<v Speaker 1>civilization works.</v>

798
00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:10.070
<v Speaker 1>Excellent resources.</v>

799
00:42:10.570 --> 00:42:15.570
<v Speaker 1>There's a great book I read called the poverty of nations normally version</v>

800
00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:22.960
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>

801
00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:23.511
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>

802
00:42:23.511 --> 00:42:25.340
<v Speaker 1>It was written by a Harvard professor.</v>

803
00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:29.630
<v Speaker 1>He was trying to figure out why some cultures and other cultures are for and he</v>

804
00:42:29.631 --> 00:42:30.810
<v Speaker 1>did an interesting analysis.</v>

805
00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:35.150
<v Speaker 1>He compared the western hemisphere countries that were settled by Portugal,</v>

806
00:42:35.151 --> 00:42:35.550
<v Speaker 1>Spain,</v>

807
00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:40.340
<v Speaker 1>France to Western countries and what he basically thought was that because of</v>

808
00:42:40.410 --> 00:42:42.310
<v Speaker 1>English common law structure and the tradition.</v>

809
00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:44.620
<v Speaker 1>So if you were settled by England,</v>

810
00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:45.643
<v Speaker 1>brew rich,</v>

811
00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:47.180
<v Speaker 1>the other countries,</v>

812
00:42:47.181 --> 00:42:48.140
<v Speaker 1>then you can do.</v>

813
00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:53.800
<v Speaker 1>And again trying to down and understand why is basically which was countries</v>

814
00:42:55.720 --> 00:43:00.580
<v Speaker 1>with common law tradition produce this produce individual interactions that are</v>

815
00:43:00.590 --> 00:43:02.390
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally predicated on trust.</v>

816
00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:03.460
<v Speaker 1>And that's what made rich.</v>

817
00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:07.820
<v Speaker 1>And you also have in Japan and Japan is very interesting society.</v>

818
00:43:07.821 --> 00:43:09.640
<v Speaker 1>But maybe I've known right.</v>

819
00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:12.090
<v Speaker 1>All they have is like rocks and rights.</v>

820
00:43:13.350 --> 00:43:18.140
<v Speaker 1>The rights that I think if we don't agree on price because it's too expensive to</v>

821
00:43:18.141 --> 00:43:18.710
<v Speaker 1>grow there.</v>

822
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:19.543
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

823
00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:23.030
<v Speaker 1>But they do have interpersonal trust.</v>

824
00:43:23.290 --> 00:43:27.410
<v Speaker 1>You're stable enough and so rich because of that,</v>

825
00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:28.820
<v Speaker 1>and so his people is.</v>

826
00:43:28.830 --> 00:43:30.100
<v Speaker 1>You're fortunate you're camping.</v>

827
00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:32.030
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it might come to me.</v>

828
00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:37.150
<v Speaker 1>Was that the only genuine naturally resource was honesty of trucks and</v>

829
00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:41.640
<v Speaker 1>I think there's something broke up.</v>

830
00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:44.120
<v Speaker 1>It's deeply true,</v>

831
00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:46.760
<v Speaker 1>so okay,</v>

832
00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:50.810
<v Speaker 1>so back to the idea of meeting.</v>

833
00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:51.291
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

834
00:43:51.291 --> 00:43:52.120
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

835
00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:53.840
<v Speaker 1>if you experience meaning in your life,</v>

836
00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:58.930
<v Speaker 1>when you move your comfort into the unknown and you do that because you're</v>

837
00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:04.070
<v Speaker 1>courageous enough to take on the burden of your own vulnerability and to expand</v>

838
00:44:04.071 --> 00:44:09.071
<v Speaker 1>your competence and when you do that properly engaged with the world and you</v>

839
00:44:09.351 --> 00:44:14.120
<v Speaker 1>feel that your existence is worthwhile and you feel bad because you are in fact</v>

840
00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:15.950
<v Speaker 1>making yourself better in a way.</v>

841
00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:20.190
<v Speaker 1>It's also making things better at the same time and then rely on.</v>

842
00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:21.170
<v Speaker 1>That's reliable.</v>

843
00:44:21.171 --> 00:44:21.800
<v Speaker 1>Mark.</v>

844
00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:22.161
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

845
00:44:22.161 --> 00:44:22.311
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

846
00:44:22.311 --> 00:44:23.660
<v Speaker 1>what should you have faith in?</v>

847
00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:26.150
<v Speaker 1>Let's say in terms of your fundamental axiom?</v>

848
00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:28.700
<v Speaker 1>You could start by causeways</v>

849
00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:31.860
<v Speaker 1>existence is to do it.</v>

850
00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:34.280
<v Speaker 1>You could start by,</v>

851
00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:35.313
<v Speaker 1>you could say,</v>

852
00:44:35.590 --> 00:44:38.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to access this acetates.</v>

853
00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:40.500
<v Speaker 1>Obviously you can just do that in a serious way.</v>

854
00:44:41.130 --> 00:44:44.260
<v Speaker 1>If you will one way in one seven,</v>

855
00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:49.130
<v Speaker 1>which is I think if the world gets better when you make the other decision,</v>

856
00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:50.800
<v Speaker 1>consequences of purchase,</v>

857
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.830
<v Speaker 1>which is the world gets worse,</v>

858
00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:53.911
<v Speaker 1>so you would say,</v>

859
00:44:53.911 --> 00:44:54.744
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

860
00:44:54.850 --> 00:44:57.750
<v Speaker 1>as this being itself is justifiable,</v>

861
00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:00.760
<v Speaker 1>and then let's take the further step in.</v>

862
00:45:01.110 --> 00:45:04.220
<v Speaker 1>Our proper role is to accept</v>

863
00:45:06.310 --> 00:45:07.143
<v Speaker 1>the world</v>

864
00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:12.170
<v Speaker 1>and then so people see that</v>

865
00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:16.410
<v Speaker 1>that's the right way.</v>

866
00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:18.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like blocking.</v>

867
00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:20.990
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's</v>

868
00:45:22.690 --> 00:45:24.690
<v Speaker 1>justifiable proper role.</v>

869
00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:28.890
<v Speaker 1>It did not be of use to do everything we possibly can to make things as good</v>

870
00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:32.320
<v Speaker 1>and then that sound that's a.</v>

871
00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:33.420
<v Speaker 1>that's active.</v>

872
00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:36.720
<v Speaker 1>Our statement about a set of propositions.</v>

873
00:45:36.810 --> 00:45:37.643
<v Speaker 1>Do you.</v>

874
00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:39.570
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean by that?</v>

875
00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:44.630
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean by believe it or are you talking to the set of articulating</v>

876
00:45:44.631 --> 00:45:45.470
<v Speaker 1>double socks,</v>

877
00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:49.490
<v Speaker 1>so like that's not the deepest form of policing to be in the form of bleeding.</v>

878
00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:55.523
<v Speaker 1>What's</v>

879
00:46:00.490 --> 00:46:03.180
<v Speaker 1>the alternative is to make everything worse and maybe</v>

880
00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:06.150
<v Speaker 1>it's a bad idea.</v>

881
00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:10.470
<v Speaker 1>It also can I get also in some sense to me,</v>

882
00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:15.600
<v Speaker 1>because I do believe that the human spirit is in some senses and going on almost</v>

883
00:46:15.630 --> 00:46:16.400
<v Speaker 1>like we could.</v>

884
00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:20.360
<v Speaker 1>Maybe of what we all trying to make the ask,</v>

885
00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:21.630
<v Speaker 1>at the very least,</v>

886
00:46:21.631 --> 00:46:26.631
<v Speaker 1>I know that it stops things from degenerating into the kind of absolutely</v>

887
00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:32.160
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic health and we experienced in the 20th century and that will to</v>

888
00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:33.203
<v Speaker 1>avoid</v>

889
00:46:34.170 --> 00:46:35.130
<v Speaker 1>paradise on earth.</v>

890
00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:39.420
<v Speaker 1>If we can all work towards the kingdom on the hill,</v>

891
00:46:39.450 --> 00:46:42.670
<v Speaker 1>we could make sure that we get these backwards into the sorts of counsel</v>

892
00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:43.573
<v Speaker 1>characterized</v>

893
00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:46.630
<v Speaker 1>in the Soviet Union,</v>

894
00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:00.053
<v Speaker 1>be well.</v>

895
00:47:00.690 --> 00:47:05.690
<v Speaker 1>We're going to accept the team is justifiable parking by noticing that despite</v>

896
00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:11.940
<v Speaker 1>some we've already made that judgment way and we're going to act as if our</v>

897
00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:17.280
<v Speaker 1>proper role in life is to take the overwhelming weight of our on our shoulders</v>

898
00:47:17.530 --> 00:47:19.330
<v Speaker 1>and work to make things better regardless,</v>

899
00:47:19.331 --> 00:47:20.680
<v Speaker 1>which is a really noble pursuit,</v>

900
00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:21.220
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

901
00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:21.770
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

902
00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:22.511
<v Speaker 1>because you might think,</v>

903
00:47:22.511 --> 00:47:23.344
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

904
00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:28.500
<v Speaker 1>how is it possible given your current circumstances and wretchedness that you</v>

905
00:47:28.511 --> 00:47:30.970
<v Speaker 1>could possibly have regard for yourself,</v>

906
00:47:31.890 --> 00:47:32.723
<v Speaker 1>for yourself?</v>

907
00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:33.680
<v Speaker 1>Self esteem,</v>

908
00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:34.810
<v Speaker 1>because I hate that phrase,</v>

909
00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:37.840
<v Speaker 1>but for yourself and say,</v>

910
00:47:37.841 --> 00:47:38.240
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>

911
00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:40.110
<v Speaker 1>if you know that your.</v>

912
00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:44.570
<v Speaker 1>Your fundamental conditions of existence are tragic with the touch of</v>

913
00:47:44.890 --> 00:47:49.750
<v Speaker 1>malevolence just to make it worse and if your eyes are open to that,</v>

914
00:47:49.751 --> 00:47:54.380
<v Speaker 1>do you understand the catastrophic nature of that and then just wipe that.</v>

915
00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:55.060
<v Speaker 1>You just started.</v>

916
00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:59.380
<v Speaker 1>Your job is to wake up in the morning and put things right and maybe you could</v>

917
00:47:59.381 --> 00:47:59.891
<v Speaker 1>also say,</v>

918
00:47:59.891 --> 00:48:00.101
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

919
00:48:00.101 --> 00:48:00.934
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

920
00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:02.110
<v Speaker 1>such a bad preacher,</v>

921
00:48:02.111 --> 00:48:07.111
<v Speaker 1>all things considered that I could take down and still work would be to help</v>

922
00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:13.210
<v Speaker 1>myself with everyone else on board to help with otherwise the birch.</v>

923
00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:14.403
<v Speaker 2>So here's</v>

924
00:48:24.970 --> 00:48:26.830
<v Speaker 1>check in with no ability</v>

925
00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:31.600
<v Speaker 1>to justify your business's existence in the world.</v>

926
00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:33.190
<v Speaker 1>That's what we need</v>

927
00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:40.420
<v Speaker 1>is disappears because baseball is good for you.</v>

928
00:48:41.050 --> 00:48:42.190
<v Speaker 1>Enjoy it and I'm running</v>

929
00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:49.780
<v Speaker 1>through the storm because of students and if happiness is what's keeping you up</v>

930
00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:54.690
<v Speaker 1>and you sing and that's good because the storms are always coming and so what?</v>

931
00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:58.180
<v Speaker 1>You need something that will get you through the store and the idea that there's</v>

932
00:48:58.181 --> 00:49:01.100
<v Speaker 1>something to struggle this.</v>

933
00:49:01.650 --> 00:49:02.483
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

934
00:49:03.410 --> 00:49:03.790
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

935
00:49:03.790 --> 00:49:07.540
<v Speaker 1>that's something you can take to the bank and if you have that road in the</v>

936
00:49:07.541 --> 00:49:08.374
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

937
00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:12.110
<v Speaker 1>not only will you make your own life better and you make yourself stronger and</v>

938
00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:16.780
<v Speaker 1>improve your character and make things better for your family,</v>

939
00:49:17.790 --> 00:49:18.640
<v Speaker 1>for your society,</v>

940
00:49:18.641 --> 00:49:20.380
<v Speaker 1>and so that sense of meaning.</v>

941
00:49:20.410 --> 00:49:23.620
<v Speaker 1>This is something that also is true,</v>

942
00:49:23.621 --> 00:49:28.621
<v Speaker 1>is that sense of meaning that orients in relationship to the node and also</v>

943
00:49:29.850 --> 00:49:33.050
<v Speaker 1>orients you towards the the what would you call it,</v>

944
00:49:33.051 --> 00:49:35.860
<v Speaker 1>the stacking of different levels of being.</v>

945
00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:40.840
<v Speaker 1>So in order to properly in the world,</v>

946
00:49:41.110 --> 00:49:46.110
<v Speaker 1>you can't just exist for yourself because you don't just exist right now that</v>

947
00:49:47.290 --> 00:49:48.820
<v Speaker 1>you exist right now and you exist.</v>

948
00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:49.960
<v Speaker 1>You exist.</v>

949
00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:51.150
<v Speaker 1>It's month next year,</v>

950
00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:56.200
<v Speaker 1>so you have to act in the moment such that the probability that you will</v>

951
00:49:56.231 --> 00:50:01.231
<v Speaker 1>continue to exist and happen at those other traits and also civil exists.</v>

952
00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:05.460
<v Speaker 1>So that means that you have to bite your.</v>

953
00:50:05.660 --> 00:50:10.560
<v Speaker 1>You're actually the present or the necessity for your continued to propagate you</v>

954
00:50:10.561 --> 00:50:12.710
<v Speaker 1>to cross the discovery in future.</v>

955
00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:14.820
<v Speaker 1>Something that's very unique to humans.</v>

956
00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:20.030
<v Speaker 1>So you have to take into account your future self and that's very much different</v>

957
00:50:20.170 --> 00:50:24.580
<v Speaker 1>and taking it to other people and you also have to do that.</v>

958
00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:26.980
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to exist in the future,</v>

959
00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:31.750
<v Speaker 1>you're going to exist in a way that makes other people want to exist because</v>

960
00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:34.000
<v Speaker 1>otherwise things might fall apart pretty down you.</v>

961
00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:34.970
<v Speaker 1>You're done,</v>

962
00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:39.930
<v Speaker 1>you're gone and so misbehaving in any fundamental way isn't that long term</v>

963
00:50:39.931 --> 00:50:40.764
<v Speaker 1>survival,</v>

964
00:50:40.990 --> 00:50:41.820
<v Speaker 1>so you might think,</v>

965
00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:46.820
<v Speaker 1>well to act properly in regards to your future selves at something like</v>

966
00:50:49.051 --> 00:50:53.540
<v Speaker 1>integrated with the gratification and sacrifice and you haven't been out in a</v>

967
00:50:53.541 --> 00:50:57.530
<v Speaker 1>way that also benefits your family and that also benefits your community.</v>

968
00:50:57.950 --> 00:51:00.910
<v Speaker 1>And I'm also saying that's the last to close</v>

969
00:51:02.970 --> 00:51:07.060
<v Speaker 1>and the client that there's no such thing as a fundamental.</v>

970
00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:10.790
<v Speaker 1>It's something like this.</v>

971
00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:15.900
<v Speaker 1>The world is so complicated that you can interpret and that actually happens to</v>

972
00:51:15.951 --> 00:51:16.784
<v Speaker 1>be true.</v>

973
00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:21.460
<v Speaker 1>The world is so complicated in this and you can see it definitely like our</v>

974
00:51:21.461 --> 00:51:22.730
<v Speaker 1>vision is a real mystery,</v>

975
00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:28.160
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that there's an infinite number of ways of potentially interpreting</v>

976
00:51:28.161 --> 00:51:29.870
<v Speaker 1>the world is not for a moment.</v>

977
00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:34.910
<v Speaker 1>If there's an indefinite number of valid ways of existing in the world and when</v>

978
00:51:34.911 --> 00:51:38.630
<v Speaker 1>you think about the constraints that are put on your existence,</v>

979
00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:43.720
<v Speaker 1>then you can see the proper ways of existing in the world start to shrink to a</v>

980
00:51:44.391 --> 00:51:44.711
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

981
00:51:44.711 --> 00:51:46.510
<v Speaker 1>very school range.</v>

982
00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:51.800
<v Speaker 1>I said I really like to bit about this idea since some of you might have heard</v>

983
00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:56.800
<v Speaker 1>some of the things that's upsetting or pha</v>

984
00:51:58.860 --> 00:51:59.510
<v Speaker 1>purposes,</v>

985
00:51:59.510 --> 00:52:01.100
<v Speaker 1>analysis of children's gates,</v>

986
00:52:01.790 --> 00:52:04.370
<v Speaker 1>children's Microcosm Society,</v>

987
00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:09.820
<v Speaker 1>which is what children white about African societies would be generate toys,</v>

988
00:52:10.090 --> 00:52:10.960
<v Speaker 1>societies,</v>

989
00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:14.050
<v Speaker 1>which is video games or go see the movie by the way,</v>

990
00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:15.700
<v Speaker 1>you generate twice society.</v>

991
00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:19.390
<v Speaker 1>Then you practice affidavit signed the past.</v>

992
00:52:19.570 --> 00:52:19.990
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

993
00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:20.360
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

994
00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:25.360
<v Speaker 1>It has the same structure as real society except that lower resolution children</v>

995
00:52:25.590 --> 00:52:30.560
<v Speaker 1>or giving them a loan with playing because they're actually practicing learning</v>

996
00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:31.890
<v Speaker 1>council exists.</v>

997
00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:34.290
<v Speaker 1>It isn't trivial.</v>

998
00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:42.500
<v Speaker 1>That's a good indication that they're following the path of meeting in the world</v>

999
00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:46.490
<v Speaker 1>and so it would be a good thing.</v>

1000
00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:47.061
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

1001
00:52:47.061 --> 00:52:51.160
<v Speaker 1>if our children are school children more than they planning,</v>

1002
00:53:06.510 --> 00:53:07.343
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1003
00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:10.600
<v Speaker 1>so children,</v>

1004
00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:15.780
<v Speaker 1>so piaget was very interested in what made me gain and some rules,</v>

1005
00:53:16.650 --> 00:53:17.483
<v Speaker 1>good game.</v>

1006
00:53:18.890 --> 00:53:23.200
<v Speaker 1>You can play iteratively and that's a good thing to know that you're going to</v>

1007
00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:25.620
<v Speaker 1>play the same everyday.</v>

1008
00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:30.180
<v Speaker 1>Well that's</v>

1009
00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:35.700
<v Speaker 1>something to think about too is you know,</v>

1010
00:53:35.701 --> 00:53:39.450
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of people make the mistake of thinking the exceptional things they</v>

1011
00:53:39.451 --> 00:53:40.110
<v Speaker 1>do in their life,</v>

1012
00:53:40.110 --> 00:53:44.760
<v Speaker 1>like the vacations they take and so forth are the important things in there and</v>

1013
00:53:44.761 --> 00:53:46.440
<v Speaker 1>that's just absolutely not true.</v>

1014
00:53:46.690 --> 00:53:50.340
<v Speaker 1>The thing is every day are they important</v>

1015
00:53:57.460 --> 00:53:58.071
<v Speaker 1>the gay thing.</v>

1016
00:53:58.071 --> 00:54:02.750
<v Speaker 1>But I had a client who was spending about 45 minutes to sort of</v>

1017
00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:06.103
<v Speaker 1>don't</v>

1018
00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:11.500
<v Speaker 1>make your children do anything to make him decide he was spending about 45</v>

1019
00:54:11.570 --> 00:54:14.770
<v Speaker 1>minutes and I'm fighting with the sun to try to get into back.</v>

1020
00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:18.950
<v Speaker 1>And so I knew the parents actually only spend on average about 20 minutes a day</v>

1021
00:54:18.951 --> 00:54:19.850
<v Speaker 1>with your kids.</v>

1022
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:22.050
<v Speaker 1>Like a direct one on one contact,</v>

1023
00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:26.330
<v Speaker 1>direct contact law enforcement at the time.</v>

1024
00:54:26.331 --> 00:54:30.260
<v Speaker 1>And so you're spending 45 minutes and right before was your kid was like,</v>

1025
00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:33.400
<v Speaker 1>that's twice as much time as you normally spend with them and if you think that</v>

1026
00:54:33.401 --> 00:54:36.290
<v Speaker 1>that's good and well and you're not thinking about.</v>

1027
00:54:36.350 --> 00:54:40.520
<v Speaker 1>So people don't like it when I do this because people don't like to risk to</v>

1028
00:54:40.550 --> 00:54:40.770
<v Speaker 1>take,</v>

1029
00:54:40.770 --> 00:54:44.380
<v Speaker 1>but we get 45 minutes a day,</v>

1030
00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:45.820
<v Speaker 1>about five hours a week,</v>

1031
00:54:46.130 --> 00:54:47.930
<v Speaker 1>eight hours a month.</v>

1032
00:54:47.930 --> 00:54:49.030
<v Speaker 1>So that's half a work.</v>

1033
00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:54.040
<v Speaker 1>Maybe people quite that by 12 and that six weeks a year or a month and a half.</v>

1034
00:54:55.100 --> 00:55:00.100
<v Speaker 1>So basically he was spending at least a year with his son.</v>

1035
00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:03.740
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's a good game.</v>

1036
00:55:04.770 --> 00:55:06.990
<v Speaker 1>That's not against anyone's going to win.</v>

1037
00:55:08.390 --> 00:55:09.830
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting to do that risk</v>

1038
00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:13.820
<v Speaker 1>with regards to the things that you repeat every day.</v>

1039
00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:17.200
<v Speaker 1>Exactly what your is made up of.</v>

1040
00:55:17.290 --> 00:55:18.680
<v Speaker 1>Those things that you repeat.</v>

1041
00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:22.000
<v Speaker 1>And so what we want to do is get those mundane things that you repeat,</v>

1042
00:55:22.010 --> 00:55:26.720
<v Speaker 1>pristine white trope that enroll of cleaning up your room.</v>

1043
00:55:26.721 --> 00:55:28.190
<v Speaker 1>It's like when you live in the damn thing,</v>

1044
00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:31.880
<v Speaker 1>it's quoted in order to go to the next step.</v>

1045
00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:34.010
<v Speaker 1>And they can manage that.</v>

1046
00:55:34.250 --> 00:55:35.630
<v Speaker 1>And it's just my room.</v>

1047
00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:36.021
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1048
00:55:36.021 --> 00:55:37.820
<v Speaker 1>well that's one way of looking at it.</v>

1049
00:55:37.850 --> 00:55:39.500
<v Speaker 1>Another way of looking at it,</v>

1050
00:55:40.050 --> 00:55:40.883
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1051
00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:42.890
<v Speaker 1>it's a microcosm of being.</v>

1052
00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:45.020
<v Speaker 1>If you have that hand and if it's.</v>

1053
00:55:45.830 --> 00:55:46.550
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

1054
00:55:46.550 --> 00:55:46.791
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

1055
00:55:46.791 --> 00:55:47.930
<v Speaker 1>what the hell are you up to?</v>

1056
00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:54.333
<v Speaker 1>Speed.</v>

1057
00:55:55.290 --> 00:55:55.630
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1058
00:55:55.630 --> 00:55:56.810
<v Speaker 1>Is it fine?</v>

1059
00:55:57.870 --> 00:56:00.310
<v Speaker 1>So if someone gets you a country to roll on,</v>

1060
00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:00.610
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1061
00:56:00.610 --> 00:56:01.530
<v Speaker 1>pull up your socks,</v>

1062
00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:02.510
<v Speaker 1>get your act together,</v>

1063
00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:13.700
<v Speaker 1>what is shaped?</v>

1064
00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:20.500
<v Speaker 1>And everybody has to be able to play it over and over.</v>

1065
00:56:20.501 --> 00:56:22.320
<v Speaker 1>But everybody has to play against the.</v>

1066
00:56:24.790 --> 00:56:25.570
<v Speaker 1>It's so cool.</v>

1067
00:56:25.570 --> 00:56:26.320
<v Speaker 1>Because he was,</v>

1068
00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:27.153
<v Speaker 1>he was asking,</v>

1069
00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:31.150
<v Speaker 1>he was actually trying to reconcile this ancient between science and religion</v>

1070
00:56:31.151 --> 00:56:31.984
<v Speaker 1>that was Australian,</v>

1071
00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:34.060
<v Speaker 1>our intellectual life.</v>

1072
00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:39.150
<v Speaker 1>And he was trying to understand the evolution of morality and one of his</v>

1073
00:56:39.281 --> 00:56:40.020
<v Speaker 1>observations,</v>

1074
00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:40.440
<v Speaker 1>what's not.</v>

1075
00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:45.440
<v Speaker 1>Children spontaneously play and their games tend to awards playable games.</v>

1076
00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:49.670
<v Speaker 1>And I play a little game is one where everyone is treated with a certain operas</v>

1077
00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:53.530
<v Speaker 1>founded as a player and everyone actually wants to play the game.</v>

1078
00:56:53.531 --> 00:56:57.310
<v Speaker 1>So it's voluntary and that's a pretty good definition of a free society.</v>

1079
00:56:57.470 --> 00:57:02.470
<v Speaker 1>It's like you get to play and you get to planning both if it's set up and so and</v>

1080
00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:05.260
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

1081
00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:09.460
<v Speaker 1>That's another indication of the fact that there's something about a fundamental</v>

1082
00:57:09.461 --> 00:57:10.040
<v Speaker 1>ethic.</v>

1083
00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:14.840
<v Speaker 1>These are just arbitrary and this is very important thing to get 21st century</v>

1084
00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:19.430
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things that we kept blaming in the 20th century was the any</v>

1085
00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:22.380
<v Speaker 1>old arbitrary arbitrary.</v>

1086
00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:26.500
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter if they're Marxist or capitalist on the arbitrary.</v>

1087
00:57:26.501 --> 00:57:26.770
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1088
00:57:26.770 --> 00:57:27.280
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1089
00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:28.120
<v Speaker 1>that's wrong.</v>

1090
00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:33.180
<v Speaker 1>That's a seriously long scientific data or the philosophical data or in</v>

1091
00:57:35.550 --> 00:57:40.550
<v Speaker 1>very constrained we can orient ourselves in the world and when they boil down to</v>

1092
00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:44.400
<v Speaker 1>I would say a seven fundamental blocks.</v>

1093
00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:50.760
<v Speaker 1>Have you been to a sovereign and I mean everybody has intrinsic value of</v>

1094
00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:52.370
<v Speaker 1>societies.</v>

1095
00:57:52.370 --> 00:57:56.050
<v Speaker 1>It's not asking for axiom</v>

1096
00:58:07.010 --> 00:58:08.300
<v Speaker 1>in the old world,</v>

1097
00:58:12.260 --> 00:58:13.860
<v Speaker 1>not convinced.</v>

1098
00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:16.820
<v Speaker 1>Maybe perhaps you shouldn't be.</v>

1099
00:58:17.090 --> 00:58:21.840
<v Speaker 1>You might also avail yourself of the relevant literature because some of the</v>

1100
00:58:21.841 --> 00:58:23.970
<v Speaker 1>most brilliant people who support.</v>

1101
00:58:23.971 --> 00:58:25.410
<v Speaker 1>I can counter trends to wall.</v>

1102
00:58:25.470 --> 00:58:26.041
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

1103
00:58:26.041 --> 00:58:31.041
<v Speaker 1>who's the primatologist who was probably the world's foremost neuroscientist of</v>

1104
00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:32.430
<v Speaker 1>emotions,</v>

1105
00:58:32.530 --> 00:58:35.450
<v Speaker 1>both studied the emergence of morality in racks.</v>

1106
00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:40.840
<v Speaker 1>That was Kinda your wall demonstrated quite clearly with the chimps is</v>

1107
00:58:42.071 --> 00:58:43.790
<v Speaker 1>particularly interesting.</v>

1108
00:58:45.180 --> 00:58:50.180
<v Speaker 1>Brutal children don't want to tar is that are predicated on power to kind of be</v>

1109
00:58:51.391 --> 00:58:52.770
<v Speaker 1>the chip patriarchy.</v>

1110
00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:55.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm serious.</v>

1111
00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:57.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm really serious about patents.</v>

1112
00:58:58.060 --> 00:58:59.400
<v Speaker 1>That's the view of the world.</v>

1113
00:58:59.490 --> 00:59:04.490
<v Speaker 1>Every hierarchy is brutal and it started in my apartment and that's the most</v>

1114
00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:06.950
<v Speaker 1>important for talking back because they're tragical.</v>

1115
00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:12.040
<v Speaker 1>You will demonstrate quite clearly of our chimps are very unstable on the people</v>

1116
00:59:12.210 --> 00:59:17.210
<v Speaker 1>and the tubes are very likely to meet an extraordinary model and so he showed</v>

1117
00:59:18.130 --> 00:59:23.130
<v Speaker 1>that for the organization was on state and it's not surprising,</v>

1118
00:59:23.571 --> 00:59:23.811
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1119
00:59:23.811 --> 00:59:25.790
<v Speaker 1>because you could choose to be nice.</v>

1120
00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:27.710
<v Speaker 1>So when the big wheel thing,</v>

1121
00:59:27.711 --> 00:59:30.640
<v Speaker 1>little rebel essentially as a consequences.</v>

1122
00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:35.650
<v Speaker 1>So you can see this emerge of epic farmer below they don't know and yeah,</v>

1123
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:38.690
<v Speaker 1>and this is something he should have won the Nobel prize.</v>

1124
00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:40.220
<v Speaker 1>He was an absolute genius.</v>

1125
00:59:40.221 --> 00:59:43.090
<v Speaker 1>He was the first point in place or a certain way.</v>

1126
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:44.750
<v Speaker 1>That's a big deal.</v>

1127
00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:46.330
<v Speaker 1>They don't know.</v>

1128
00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:51.200
<v Speaker 1>Our capacity for play is actually a consequence of a separate biological system.</v>

1129
00:59:51.201 --> 00:59:52.510
<v Speaker 1>That's a major discovery</v>

1130
00:59:54.340 --> 00:59:55.173
<v Speaker 1>study.</v>

1131
00:59:55.790 --> 00:59:56.623
<v Speaker 1>Rats,</v>

1132
00:59:57.140 --> 00:59:58.870
<v Speaker 1>rough and tumble play in particular,</v>

1133
00:59:58.871 --> 01:00:03.871
<v Speaker 1>which is a very interesting field with all others tend to do with your kids and</v>

1134
01:00:04.781 --> 01:00:08.210
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be one of the primary ways that you would father socialites that</v>

1135
01:00:08.211 --> 01:00:09.680
<v Speaker 1>geography and so it's very</v>

1136
01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:11.700
<v Speaker 1>fun,</v>

1137
01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:16.700
<v Speaker 1>was the last were to earn the right to engage in rough and tumble play and so</v>

1138
01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:22.020
<v Speaker 1>that's how you tell them and was motivated to see if it would work for something</v>

1139
01:00:22.030 --> 01:00:22.880
<v Speaker 1>that's kind kinda the same way.</v>

1140
01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:27.830
<v Speaker 1>You figure out if you can be a little bit and ratchet work under reading over</v>

1141
01:00:27.831 --> 01:00:29.560
<v Speaker 1>that you'll be able to wrestle with another bad,</v>

1142
01:00:29.561 --> 01:00:31.760
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're young juveniles,</v>

1143
01:00:31.761 --> 01:00:33.530
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're juvenile males.</v>

1144
01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:38.150
<v Speaker 1>If you pair two together and one of them was 10 percent bigger than the other,</v>

1145
01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:40.140
<v Speaker 1>the big brother stole the halo,</v>

1146
01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:44.680
<v Speaker 1>the little rap consistently and so then you get to your experiment.</v>

1147
01:00:44.681 --> 01:00:47.860
<v Speaker 1>You just paired once and big rats go say hi,</v>

1148
01:00:48.050 --> 01:00:48.740
<v Speaker 1>go ahead and start.</v>

1149
01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:50.570
<v Speaker 1>These are predicated on power.</v>

1150
01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:52.010
<v Speaker 1>That'll be your conclusion.</v>

1151
01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:52.551
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1152
01:00:52.551 --> 01:00:53.240
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1153
01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:56.900
<v Speaker 1>you missed something and what you missed because you don't play with someone.</v>

1154
01:00:56.901 --> 01:01:01.901
<v Speaker 1>Once you blend with them over and over and over and over,</v>

1155
01:01:02.030 --> 01:01:06.200
<v Speaker 1>and the rules that govern gain continues across a large,</v>

1156
01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:09.660
<v Speaker 1>safe like your time are not the same rules that govern it.</v>

1157
01:01:09.770 --> 01:01:12.850
<v Speaker 1>You will be played once because if you're playing,</v>

1158
01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:17.960
<v Speaker 1>imagine you're not claiming a set of games and then imagine that the rules for</v>

1159
01:01:18.171 --> 01:01:20.300
<v Speaker 1>winning a set of gates are not the same.</v>

1160
01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:24.280
<v Speaker 1>Rules are living one game and then you don't care about winning one game.</v>

1161
01:01:24.330 --> 01:01:27.190
<v Speaker 1>If you have any sense because you're not just going to play one game,</v>

1162
01:01:27.191 --> 01:01:30.680
<v Speaker 1>you're going to play games and so then you want to know what the rules are that</v>

1163
01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:32.900
<v Speaker 1>govern victory across the set of gates.</v>

1164
01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:36.530
<v Speaker 1>And I would also say that the reason that aren't religious presuppositions</v>

1165
01:01:36.531 --> 01:01:40.070
<v Speaker 1>evolve and this can pick them up this year.</v>

1166
01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:41.113
<v Speaker 1>This idea,</v>

1167
01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:45.890
<v Speaker 1>the reason our preset positions evolve as because we'd be trying to formulate a</v>

1168
01:01:45.891 --> 01:01:50.150
<v Speaker 1>picture of the proper action patterns that enable you to attain victory across a</v>

1169
01:01:50.151 --> 01:01:51.890
<v Speaker 1>set of all possible games.</v>

1170
01:01:52.130 --> 01:01:53.030
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very,</v>

1171
01:01:53.031 --> 01:01:55.250
<v Speaker 1>very difficult thing to figure out.</v>

1172
01:01:55.450 --> 01:01:59.110
<v Speaker 1>But you kind of know what you tell your kid when you say it doesn't matter what</v>

1173
01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:02.140
<v Speaker 1>matters and the kid system.</v>

1174
01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:03.020
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean by that?</v>

1175
01:02:03.050 --> 01:02:03.381
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

1176
01:02:03.381 --> 01:02:04.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't know</v>

1177
01:02:07.010 --> 01:02:08.620
<v Speaker 1>why kindness dual.</v>

1178
01:02:08.710 --> 01:02:11.660
<v Speaker 1>They don't all have no holds barred and do whatever I have.</v>

1179
01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:13.790
<v Speaker 1>When is that supporting the beginning?</v>

1180
01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:14.970
<v Speaker 1>It's like no one's done.</v>

1181
01:02:15.620 --> 01:02:18.010
<v Speaker 1>If someone reporting to the point of the game,</v>

1182
01:02:18.030 --> 01:02:21.270
<v Speaker 1>distribute the of the game is to play the game in a manner that ensures that</v>

1183
01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:22.170
<v Speaker 1>your complaint,</v>

1184
01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:24.990
<v Speaker 1>that most masculine number of gates that everyone at this age,</v>

1185
01:02:25.770 --> 01:02:26.700
<v Speaker 1>that's the point,</v>

1186
01:02:27.030 --> 01:02:27.480
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1187
01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:30.420
<v Speaker 1>And so part of that is trying to lead each game,</v>

1188
01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:32.610
<v Speaker 1>but there's so that's one level,</v>

1189
01:02:32.611 --> 01:02:34.860
<v Speaker 1>but really trying to it,</v>

1190
01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:38.110
<v Speaker 1>but there's a level of reality was that it's trying to again,</v>

1191
01:02:38.250 --> 01:02:41.520
<v Speaker 1>in a manner that ensures that everyone wants to keep playing with you because</v>

1192
01:02:41.521 --> 01:02:45.870
<v Speaker 1>then you'll never get out of people to play with your entire life and that's a</v>

1193
01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:46.280
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

1194
01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:48.930
<v Speaker 1>That's just what you're telling your son or your daughter.</v>

1195
01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:49.980
<v Speaker 1>When you say it doesn't matter,</v>

1196
01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:55.080
<v Speaker 1>it matters how you play and you wouldn't know that except for the fact that</v>

1197
01:02:55.081 --> 01:03:00.081
<v Speaker 1>people have struggled to conception unconscious for tens of thousands of years,</v>

1198
01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:05.700
<v Speaker 1>will attempt the problem with the fact that we iterate our processes across time</v>

1199
01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:06.950
<v Speaker 1>and so we,</v>

1200
01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:07.440
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1201
01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:07.870
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1202
01:03:07.870 --> 01:03:12.420
<v Speaker 1>we built pictures of what you attitude in life has to be like if you're going to</v>

1203
01:03:12.421 --> 01:03:15.360
<v Speaker 1>be the person who has a good chance,</v>

1204
01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:17.190
<v Speaker 1>maybe the process,</v>

1205
01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:22.100
<v Speaker 1>who has a good chance of winning across the broadest possible of circumstances?</v>

1206
01:03:22.330 --> 01:03:25.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind when you accept it,</v>

1207
01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.220
<v Speaker 1>you kind of from that,</v>

1208
01:03:28.290 --> 01:03:33.290
<v Speaker 1>if you pair it their backs together once the big round of established dominance,</v>

1209
01:03:34.410 --> 01:03:37.500
<v Speaker 1>then it was up with the little rep to invite like so the next time you put the</v>

1210
01:03:37.501 --> 01:03:39.330
<v Speaker 1>rat skimming the liberal come out,</v>

1211
01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:39.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1212
01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:40.670
<v Speaker 1>go out.</v>

1213
01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:41.730
<v Speaker 1>So they want to play.</v>

1214
01:03:42.030 --> 01:03:43.020
<v Speaker 1>It kind of clipped the rear end,</v>

1215
01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:48.240
<v Speaker 1>the down the clumps around like everyone knows this language,</v>

1216
01:03:50.550 --> 01:03:51.383
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1217
01:03:53.010 --> 01:03:54.940
<v Speaker 1>and you can pretend you're a pretty.</v>

1218
01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:56.513
<v Speaker 1>Tends to fight.</v>

1219
01:03:56.820 --> 01:03:57.570
<v Speaker 1>He's a good guy.</v>

1220
01:03:57.570 --> 01:03:58.870
<v Speaker 1>He actually doesn't like this.</v>

1221
01:03:58.890 --> 01:03:59.960
<v Speaker 1>Your first accident.</v>

1222
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.230
<v Speaker 1>Don't smack him,</v>

1223
01:04:02.270 --> 01:04:04.060
<v Speaker 1>even dogs down,</v>

1224
01:04:05.350 --> 01:04:07.410
<v Speaker 1>so in the middle of that mess.</v>

1225
01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:10.360
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to get out,</v>

1226
01:04:10.510 --> 01:04:10.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1227
01:04:10.810 --> 01:04:13.050
<v Speaker 1>does this play invitation to debate your APP?</v>

1228
01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:16.440
<v Speaker 1>And then the big little smoking</v>

1229
01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:24.080
<v Speaker 1>kind of nondescript and I stopped once ready,</v>

1230
01:04:24.090 --> 01:04:24.411
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

1231
01:04:24.411 --> 01:04:29.340
<v Speaker 1>I would feel complaints and so then he was place and he doesn't let men 30</v>

1232
01:04:29.341 --> 01:04:30.420
<v Speaker 1>percent of the time,</v>

1233
01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:32.570
<v Speaker 1>little rumbles asking for anymore.</v>

1234
01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:34.460
<v Speaker 1>And I read that.</v>

1235
01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:35.770
<v Speaker 1>It just blew me away.</v>

1236
01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:37.350
<v Speaker 1>It's so I'm.</v>

1237
01:04:40.170 --> 01:04:44.290
<v Speaker 1>And they're thinking repeated like voluntary playbox.</v>

1238
01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:47.070
<v Speaker 1>So that's where ethics comes from.</v>

1239
01:04:47.310 --> 01:04:48.210
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

1240
01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:49.200
<v Speaker 1>Well that's something,</v>

1241
01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:53.160
<v Speaker 1>that's something to discover it because he came to think of ethics is something</v>

1242
01:04:53.161 --> 01:04:57.330
<v Speaker 1>like an arbitrary articulated and then couldn't be,</v>

1243
01:04:57.340 --> 01:04:58.280
<v Speaker 1>couldn't be one thing.</v>

1244
01:04:58.290 --> 01:04:59.370
<v Speaker 1>It couldn't be Marxist,</v>

1245
01:04:59.430 --> 01:05:00.510
<v Speaker 1>couldn't be capitalists.</v>

1246
01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:05.720
<v Speaker 1>It couldn't be any number of arbitrary set of rules like no one could quite</v>

1247
01:05:06.130 --> 01:05:08.230
<v Speaker 1>isn't arbitrary there even racks on.</v>

1248
01:05:09.100 --> 01:05:12.900
<v Speaker 1>So they what do you need or even the humanity itself.</v>

1249
01:05:13.530 --> 01:05:15.720
<v Speaker 1>And so that's something that's very much worth knowing.</v>

1250
01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:17.400
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1251
01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:24.240
<v Speaker 1>So let me</v>

1252
01:05:27.650 --> 01:05:28.620
<v Speaker 1>just one rule</v>

1253
01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:34.363
<v Speaker 1>books,</v>

1254
01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:35.773
<v Speaker 1>meaning</v>

1255
01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:39.640
<v Speaker 1>nationally was the case.</v>

1256
01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:50.860
<v Speaker 1>That's the landscape that you can have and then your job is to expand it into</v>

1257
01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:53.133
<v Speaker 1>order</v>

1258
01:05:55.900 --> 01:06:00.480
<v Speaker 1>and the way you do that is by having one</v>

1259
01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:07.300
<v Speaker 1>of your challenges and then you can tell what you're doing.</v>

1260
01:06:07.301 --> 01:06:09.610
<v Speaker 1>You're engaged in what you're doing.</v>

1261
01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:13.810
<v Speaker 1>That's the mark from the deepest levels of your reading that you have the</v>

1262
01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:18.790
<v Speaker 1>constituent elements of reality property and then imagine that that's balanced</v>

1263
01:06:18.791 --> 01:06:23.770
<v Speaker 1>in a way that doesn't just work for you or you on your future cells and works</v>

1264
01:06:23.771 --> 01:06:28.460
<v Speaker 1>for you and your family and your community perhaps thing beyond that,</v>

1265
01:06:30.130 --> 01:06:33.220
<v Speaker 1>and that's why his excuses you with that sense of engagement.</v>

1266
01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:34.893
<v Speaker 1>That's</v>

1267
01:06:36.190 --> 01:06:41.190
<v Speaker 1>I think it coordinates with the best evidence we have functional and so wouldn't</v>

1268
01:06:42.571 --> 01:06:43.430
<v Speaker 1>that be someone?</v>

1269
01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:49.260
<v Speaker 1>Whatever being is like is intrinsically be and you've been with guide.</v>

1270
01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:56.460
<v Speaker 1>Is that sense of being will also help you transcend a tragic existence or how</v>

1271
01:06:56.620 --> 01:07:00.610
<v Speaker 1>are you encountering it will help you set the world.</v>

1272
01:07:00.611 --> 01:07:02.250
<v Speaker 1>Right and furthermore,</v>

1273
01:07:02.251 --> 01:07:04.060
<v Speaker 1>we're giving you that sense of</v>

1274
01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:11.100
<v Speaker 1>being that comes with knowing that your weight of your existence on your</v>

1275
01:07:11.330 --> 01:07:12.163
<v Speaker 1>shoulders</v>

1276
01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:17.350
<v Speaker 1>and stumbling towards the change so to speak.</v>

1277
01:07:17.410 --> 01:07:22.150
<v Speaker 1>Just make sure that that's the fundamental story.</v>

1278
01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:23.673
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1279
01:07:24.670 --> 01:07:29.670
<v Speaker 1>it's correct and I think it would be a lovely thing if we all woke up the 21st</v>

1280
01:07:31.571 --> 01:07:35.920
<v Speaker 1>century and understood that consciously and did everything we possibly</v>

1281
01:07:36.710 --> 01:07:38.530
<v Speaker 1>implementing pounds.</v>

1282
01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:41.510
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1283
01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:53.073
<v Speaker 1>That's</v>

1284
01:07:55.330 --> 01:07:57.380
<v Speaker 1>so true.</v>

1285
01:08:28.740 --> 01:08:29.573
<v Speaker 3>He</v>

1286
01:08:30.850 --> 01:08:31.683
<v Speaker 3>didn't.</v>

1287
01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:40.450
<v Speaker 3>This is actually.</v>

1288
01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:42.700
<v Speaker 3>Jordan's going to be the best word</v>

1289
01:08:45.820 --> 01:08:46.653
<v Speaker 3>tonight.</v>

1290
01:08:49.310 --> 01:08:50.340
<v Speaker 3>It could all come.</v>

1291
01:08:50.430 --> 01:08:51.520
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1292
01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:56.073
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>

1293
01:08:56.570 --> 01:09:00.590
<v Speaker 3>What you just heard in the last hour and a half,</v>

1294
01:09:52.230 --> 01:09:54.900
<v Speaker 3>30 years ago when you started doing this,</v>

1295
01:09:57.610 --> 01:09:59.620
<v Speaker 3>people would be dressing up like upstairs.</v>

1296
01:10:08.180 --> 01:10:10.930
<v Speaker 1>It's a funny thing because,</v>

1297
01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:13.663
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1298
01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:14.870
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1299
01:10:22.970 --> 01:10:23.803
<v Speaker 2>Courtney</v>

1300
01:10:32.020 --> 01:10:32.853
<v Speaker 1>surprised</v>

1301
01:10:35.780 --> 01:10:36.290
<v Speaker 1>stamp.</v>

1302
01:10:36.290 --> 01:10:36.960
<v Speaker 1>What level?</v>

1303
01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:37.793
<v Speaker 1>Not surprised.</v>

1304
01:10:38.530 --> 01:10:40.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm not surprised just because</v>

1305
01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:46.130
<v Speaker 1>when I learned that they just.</v>

1306
01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:47.073
<v Speaker 1>They just.</v>

1307
01:10:47.250 --> 01:10:48.083
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1308
01:10:48.630 --> 01:10:50.350
<v Speaker 1>You know there's some things in that</v>

1309
01:10:53.020 --> 01:10:54.600
<v Speaker 1>nature is amy.</v>

1310
01:10:56.490 --> 01:10:59.030
<v Speaker 1>I think I practice the old stories,</v>

1311
01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:01.840
<v Speaker 1>one of the people to that story.</v>

1312
01:11:02.130 --> 01:11:05.990
<v Speaker 1>When I finally understood that those stories that I never written off,</v>

1313
01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:11.090
<v Speaker 1>it was so absolutely overwhelming because it's a story.</v>

1314
01:11:11.110 --> 01:11:12.620
<v Speaker 1>It's the Mesopotamian story,</v>

1315
01:11:12.930 --> 01:11:15.100
<v Speaker 1>Fish Egyptian story.</v>

1316
01:11:15.110 --> 01:11:15.940
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>

1317
01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:17.590
<v Speaker 1>at the beginning of those</v>

1318
01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:22.200
<v Speaker 1>stories have that modal forced,</v>

1319
01:11:22.270 --> 01:11:24.810
<v Speaker 1>pushed the whole culture for thousands of years.</v>

1320
01:11:25.290 --> 01:11:29.400
<v Speaker 1>If you kind of stumble across what the story means and you'd see the power,</v>

1321
01:11:29.530 --> 01:11:30.450
<v Speaker 1>let's not surprised,</v>

1322
01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:32.700
<v Speaker 1>and I asked her</v>

1323
01:11:35.740 --> 01:11:40.740
<v Speaker 1>what's the base that I got to teach when I was teaching this was just benign</v>

1324
01:11:41.531 --> 01:11:42.364
<v Speaker 1>neglect</v>

1325
01:11:49.020 --> 01:11:49.853
<v Speaker 1>rail.</v>

1326
01:11:51.730 --> 01:11:54.540
<v Speaker 1>So it's not surprising stories</v>

1327
01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:59.190
<v Speaker 1>because they are exactly the kinds of stories</v>

1328
01:12:01.950 --> 01:12:02.783
<v Speaker 1>and so</v>

1329
01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:09.730
<v Speaker 1>carl is a genius and a perfectly proportioned,</v>

1330
01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:14.300
<v Speaker 1>staggering my fingers back into and so</v>

1331
01:12:16.770 --> 01:12:17.160
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

1332
01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:19.770
<v Speaker 1>it's terrible to say</v>

1333
01:12:22.710 --> 01:12:25.490
<v Speaker 1>you're within a great story and we need.</v>

1334
01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:28.710
<v Speaker 1>We need to have a pre tools generation after generation.</v>

1335
01:12:28.890 --> 01:12:33.090
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely necessary and so this is a manifestation of that.</v>

1336
01:12:33.091 --> 01:12:34.530
<v Speaker 1>I think we'll see.</v>

1337
01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:36.473
<v Speaker 1>We shall see.</v>

1338
01:12:46.420 --> 01:12:49.550
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't be the order that is probably most important one.</v>

1339
01:12:49.750 --> 01:12:52.590
<v Speaker 1>When will you be doing a duet with Kanye West?</v>

1340
01:13:07.890 --> 01:13:09.470
<v Speaker 1>You've been talking about music a little bit</v>

1341
01:13:17.470 --> 01:13:18.303
<v Speaker 1>harder.</v>

1342
01:13:29.180 --> 01:13:30.060
<v Speaker 1>You're good to go.</v>

1343
01:13:36.930 --> 01:13:37.740
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

1344
01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:38.573
<v Speaker 1>here we go.</v>

1345
01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:42.270
<v Speaker 1>Shannon still</v>

1346
01:13:50.210 --> 01:13:51.043
<v Speaker 1>interestingly,</v>

1347
01:13:52.850 --> 01:13:53.800
<v Speaker 1>so the first thing,</v>

1348
01:13:54.110 --> 01:13:56.010
<v Speaker 1>the gym still reflects the light,</v>

1349
01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:57.410
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1350
01:13:57.410 --> 01:14:01.410
<v Speaker 1>And why does the system look at the beach and then like it's associated with</v>

1351
01:14:01.411 --> 01:14:04.010
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and it's associated with the idea.</v>

1352
01:14:04.011 --> 01:14:07.580
<v Speaker 1>That whole idea that the some hero</v>

1353
01:14:10.350 --> 01:14:15.350
<v Speaker 1>hero is the database that confronts the private therapist at night and balanced</v>

1354
01:14:18.450 --> 01:14:23.200
<v Speaker 1>way through that and Victoria says a morning and so that's part of the</v>

1355
01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:28.180
<v Speaker 1>condemnation with the idea of life and to have something that reflects like</v>

1356
01:14:28.210 --> 01:14:28.380
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1357
01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:33.380
<v Speaker 1>to have something that partakes of that heavenly process of civil thing and so,</v>

1358
01:14:34.930 --> 01:14:37.030
<v Speaker 1>but then there's another level of analysis.</v>

1359
01:14:37.031 --> 01:14:37.990
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting.</v>

1360
01:14:38.050 --> 01:14:40.000
<v Speaker 1>This is quite iron man for example,</v>

1361
01:14:40.001 --> 01:14:43.450
<v Speaker 1>in the avengers movies basically as a crystal that keeps them a lot.</v>

1362
01:14:43.510 --> 01:14:47.680
<v Speaker 1>It's easy enough for Casa del chemical transformation towards goal as part of</v>

1363
01:14:47.681 --> 01:14:47.761
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1364
01:14:47.761 --> 01:14:49.030
<v Speaker 1>That's logical substructure.</v>

1365
01:14:49.031 --> 01:14:53.740
<v Speaker 1>That story like a crystal and crystal is very,</v>

1366
01:14:53.741 --> 01:14:58.741
<v Speaker 1>very interesting material object because pure crystal diamond is exactly the</v>

1367
01:15:00.221 --> 01:15:02.150
<v Speaker 1>same at every level of analysis.</v>

1368
01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:04.350
<v Speaker 1>Like all of the molecules in Math Olympiad</v>

1369
01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:07.270
<v Speaker 1>are lined up perfectly.</v>

1370
01:15:07.630 --> 01:15:08.260
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>

1371
01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:13.000
<v Speaker 1>So it's one thing and that's like so part and it's the fact that it's one thing</v>

1372
01:15:13.090 --> 01:15:18.090
<v Speaker 1>that makes it respect and so there's a synchronistic relationship between the</v>

1373
01:15:19.601 --> 01:15:23.930
<v Speaker 1>purity and the hardness of the stone and its ability to reflect and to the</v>

1374
01:15:23.931 --> 01:15:28.931
<v Speaker 1>nation and the implication of that for a human made you want to do is confront</v>

1375
01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:35.160
<v Speaker 1>even pressure to transform yourself into something that's one thing and every</v>

1376
01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:40.960
<v Speaker 1>possible level and then you also reflect and that's also metaphorically speaking</v>

1377
01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:43.360
<v Speaker 1>and that's something that's symbolized by,</v>

1378
01:15:43.650 --> 01:15:44.190
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>

1379
01:15:44.190 --> 01:15:49.190
<v Speaker 1>by the job still and that that gives you an example of how we are,</v>

1380
01:15:49.810 --> 01:15:50.081
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1381
01:15:50.081 --> 01:15:52.510
<v Speaker 1>because like sparkly things</v>

1382
01:15:58.060 --> 01:16:03.050
<v Speaker 1>that those things are regardless and what.</v>

1383
01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:04.080
<v Speaker 1>It's just some arbitrary,</v>

1384
01:16:04.780 --> 01:16:05.700
<v Speaker 1>not arbitrary,</v>

1385
01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:11.600
<v Speaker 1>the jokes to all shake them and giving them to people because it's a symbol of</v>

1386
01:16:12.060 --> 01:16:16.050
<v Speaker 1>permanence and don't want to make like that.</v>

1387
01:16:16.180 --> 01:16:17.013
<v Speaker 1>So to speak.</v>

1388
01:16:22.410 --> 01:16:23.243
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1389
01:16:29.860 --> 01:16:30.693
<v Speaker 1>The</v>

1390
01:16:32.660 --> 01:16:33.493
<v Speaker 1>Christmas tree</v>

1391
01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:40.880
<v Speaker 1>to bring the idea to celebrate in darkness,</v>

1392
01:16:42.481 --> 01:16:45.500
<v Speaker 1>to celebrate the of the light in the darkness,</v>

1393
01:16:46.430 --> 01:16:51.430
<v Speaker 1>to associate the idea of the night and the darkness of winter would be birth of</v>

1394
01:16:52.710 --> 01:16:54.630
<v Speaker 1>the redeeming hero,</v>

1395
01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:55.553
<v Speaker 1>which is dark.</v>

1396
01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:00.840
<v Speaker 1>It improves it.</v>

1397
01:17:01.060 --> 01:17:03.290
<v Speaker 1>And so all of that stack up and ritual,</v>

1398
01:17:03.340 --> 01:17:05.030
<v Speaker 1>this body that you undertake,</v>

1399
01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:10.900
<v Speaker 1>it's so fascinating to see the test case because we have wisdom that</v>

1400
01:17:12.730 --> 01:17:13.563
<v Speaker 1>understands,</v>

1401
01:17:14.010 --> 01:17:16.510
<v Speaker 1>which is to say that more and more complicated as we know,</v>

1402
01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:19.010
<v Speaker 1>obviously the case,</v>

1403
01:17:20.750 --> 01:17:23.270
<v Speaker 1>even representative things that you don't.</v>

1404
01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:26.090
<v Speaker 1>We go see movies like Harry Potter,</v>

1405
01:17:26.091 --> 01:17:26.924
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1406
01:17:28.050 --> 01:17:28.883
<v Speaker 1>can be</v>

1407
01:17:31.900 --> 01:17:33.950
<v Speaker 1>kids to read seven slash $600</v>

1408
01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:40.150
<v Speaker 1>stadiums and they would all come with Mrs Virgil Stories,</v>

1409
01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:42.633
<v Speaker 1>a</v>

1410
01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:48.150
<v Speaker 1>whatever movie empire generate</v>

1411
01:17:50.180 --> 01:17:51.050
<v Speaker 1>telling these stories.</v>

1412
01:17:51.530 --> 01:17:53.060
<v Speaker 1>What was the story she told?</v>

1413
01:17:53.450 --> 01:17:58.450
<v Speaker 1>She joined us an orphan hero who was willing to die for artists.</v>

1414
01:18:01.170 --> 01:18:02.280
<v Speaker 1>Heard that story before.</v>

1415
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:04.830
<v Speaker 2>Great</v>

1416
01:18:08.690 --> 01:18:11.380
<v Speaker 1>recedes into the background state.</v>

1417
01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:14.530
<v Speaker 1>What's happening with Christianity and new mythological</v>

1418
01:18:17.570 --> 01:18:18.403
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>

1419
01:18:19.210 --> 01:18:22.750
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what Scott wants</v>

1420
01:18:25.830 --> 01:18:26.663
<v Speaker 1>to</v>

1421
01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:29.393
<v Speaker 1>screen,</v>

1422
01:18:31.970 --> 01:18:35.320
<v Speaker 1>and so luckily it has enough power to rejuvenate itself and</v>

1423
01:18:38.020 --> 01:18:43.020
<v Speaker 1>engineering price per superheroes</v>

1424
01:18:44.140 --> 01:18:46.810
<v Speaker 2>marbles,</v>

1425
01:18:57.740 --> 01:18:58.573
<v Speaker 1>worst</v>

1426
01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:06.510
<v Speaker 1>actually collapsed,</v>

1427
01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:08.753
<v Speaker 1>collapsed.</v>

1428
01:19:09.860 --> 01:19:12.730
<v Speaker 1>I can reduce use of</v>

1429
01:19:14.970 --> 01:19:15.803
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>

1430
01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:21.010
<v Speaker 1>Nature predicted</v>

1431
01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:26.960
<v Speaker 1>because of the fundamental narrative you described,</v>

1432
01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.450
<v Speaker 1>that as you celebrate,</v>

1433
01:19:31.420 --> 01:19:34.410
<v Speaker 1>you will never find enough water to wash.</v>

1434
01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:40.510
<v Speaker 1>In Twentieth Century Relief</v>

<v Speaker 1>Pitcher,</v>

1436
01:19:53.390 --> 01:19:54.223
<v Speaker 1>he</v>

1437
01:19:55.540 --> 01:19:58.900
<v Speaker 1>described the sort of character which you get from the Russian revolution.</v>

1438
01:20:00.150 --> 01:20:05.150
<v Speaker 1>So could you lose you lose your ear angel differentiated into their tribal</v>

1439
01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:07.513
<v Speaker 1>communities,</v>

1440
01:20:07.710 --> 01:20:08.710
<v Speaker 1>completely out,</v>

1441
01:20:08.820 --> 01:20:13.820
<v Speaker 1>or we will lose faith in life and I'm not listing for that gender and science at</v>

1442
01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:18.840
<v Speaker 1>the same sleep as well as being depressed and anxious,</v>

1443
01:20:18.910 --> 01:20:23.610
<v Speaker 1>desert bitter and resentful and cruel and murderous and genocidal.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>

1446

<v Speaker 1>conditional assistance or explicit systems are metaphorical narrative that's</v>

1447
01:20:42.820 --> 01:20:46.750
<v Speaker 1>facing our industry function and lose that.</v>

1448
01:20:46.970 --> 01:20:51.970
<v Speaker 1>It's whatever your last ideas that I've been describing,</v>

1449
01:20:54.910 --> 01:20:59.910
<v Speaker 1>what your responsibilities is to rescue him from the belly of a whale.</v>

1450
01:21:00.740 --> 01:21:02.480
<v Speaker 1>Watch you think about</v>

1451
01:21:04.410 --> 01:21:07.770
<v Speaker 1>90 percent of this audience it and don't</v>

1452
01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:11.013
<v Speaker 1>launch</v>

1453
01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:15.280
<v Speaker 1>into a whale.</v>

1454
01:21:18.020 --> 01:21:18.920
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

1455
01:21:23.370 --> 01:21:24.580
<v Speaker 1>Why don't we use,</v>

1456
01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:27.530
<v Speaker 1>which is just absolutely beyond</v>

1457
01:21:29.380 --> 01:21:29.590
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1458
01:21:29.590 --> 01:21:30.423
<v Speaker 1>Make sense?</v>

1459
01:21:31.750 --> 01:21:32.583
<v Speaker 4>No</v>

1460
01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:38.980
<v Speaker 1>father's house</v>

1461
01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:45.360
<v Speaker 1>all the way it members all the way to ancient Egypt.</v>

1462
01:21:45.750 --> 01:21:46.860
<v Speaker 1>The I'm not.</v>

1463
01:21:47.540 --> 01:21:48.390
<v Speaker 1>It's an idea.</v>

1464
01:21:49.460 --> 01:21:52.850
<v Speaker 1>You can see as as the,</v>

1465
01:21:52.940 --> 01:21:53.690
<v Speaker 1>as the,</v>

1466
01:21:53.690 --> 01:21:54.270
<v Speaker 1>as the,</v>

1467
01:21:54.270 --> 01:21:55.990
<v Speaker 1>as the corpus of your</v>

1468
01:21:57.980 --> 01:21:58.813
<v Speaker 1>produce.</v>

1469
01:21:58.940 --> 01:21:59.890
<v Speaker 1>People with more.</v>

1470
01:21:59.910 --> 01:22:00.520
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1471
01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:01.160
<v Speaker 1>it was good.</v>

1472
01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:05.910
<v Speaker 1>Despite the data and there's a spirit that animates and it's necessary for you</v>

1473
01:22:05.940 --> 01:22:06.920
<v Speaker 1>because your historical</v>

1474
01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:09.353
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>

1475
01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:14.440
<v Speaker 1>it's necessary to revitalize the spirit of that three in order to live you</v>

1476
01:22:14.621 --> 01:22:18.600
<v Speaker 1>chaplin property without a preacher,</v>

1477
01:22:19.050 --> 01:22:20.430
<v Speaker 1>and so am regeneration,</v>

1478
01:22:21.010 --> 01:22:23.310
<v Speaker 1>ethical responsibility of every generation.</v>

1479
01:22:23.430 --> 01:22:24.870
<v Speaker 1>To go into the underworld,</v>

1480
01:22:25.180 --> 01:22:27.300
<v Speaker 1>which is to face the things that you're most afraid of,</v>

1481
01:22:27.310 --> 01:22:28.770
<v Speaker 1>which is the fire breathing dragon.</v>

1482
01:22:29.210 --> 01:22:30.490
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell them to somebody else.</v>

1483
01:22:30.900 --> 01:22:33.350
<v Speaker 1>Springs a fire breathing dragon.</v>

1484
01:22:34.770 --> 01:22:37.970
<v Speaker 1>Remember what happens when we don't breathing,</v>

1485
01:22:38.570 --> 01:22:43.410
<v Speaker 1>drag it out of the with the and</v>

1486
01:22:47.020 --> 01:22:48.770
<v Speaker 1>drag and about</v>

1487
01:22:51.540 --> 01:22:53.740
<v Speaker 1>competitors in danger of permanent.</v>

1488
01:22:55.500 --> 01:22:57.070
<v Speaker 1>You're kind of assessing him.</v>

1489
01:22:57.270 --> 01:23:01.280
<v Speaker 1>Just let him speak yourself and as a consequence,</v>

1490
01:23:01.281 --> 01:23:03.000
<v Speaker 1>he washed the beach.</v>

1491
01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:11.320
<v Speaker 5>What the temperature is a terrible,</v>

1492
01:23:13.930 --> 01:23:18.750
<v Speaker 5>horrific rep council will be necessary part of the ethical</v>

1493
01:23:20.790 --> 01:23:21.650
<v Speaker 5>and so</v>

1494
01:23:23.170 --> 01:23:28.170
<v Speaker 5>that's another example of how these are so you have tried yourself back into the</v>

1495
01:23:29.791 --> 01:23:34.000
<v Speaker 5>past to resurrect the spirit of your traditions because of the lost and the</v>

1496
01:23:34.001 --> 01:23:39.001
<v Speaker 5>problem with the last first and the second is to make you susceptible to second</v>

1497
01:23:41.891 --> 01:23:43.090
<v Speaker 5>grade religious structures,</v>

1498
01:23:43.091 --> 01:23:45.760
<v Speaker 5>even forms and the ideologies because you're not going to like.</v>

1499
01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:47.250
<v Speaker 5>You're either going to be cost</v>

1500
01:23:49.050 --> 01:23:53.760
<v Speaker 5>or if you open up like fundamental really fundamental soul,</v>

1501
01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:54.640
<v Speaker 5>deep market,</v>

1502
01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:55.473
<v Speaker 5>differently structured,</v>

1503
01:23:55.690 --> 01:23:58.870
<v Speaker 5>we're going to be in soccer for the first person who comes along and halfway to</v>

1504
01:23:58.900 --> 01:24:02.770
<v Speaker 5>need and that's not getting a university education</v>

1505
01:24:32.670 --> 01:24:36.330
<v Speaker 5>sometimes weird sometimes.</v>

1506
01:24:36.331 --> 01:24:37.930
<v Speaker 5>I know I've been a</v>

1507
01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:40.353
<v Speaker 5>little bit.</v>

1508
01:24:44.830 --> 01:24:47.420
<v Speaker 5>Thanks</v>

1509
01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:49.833
<v Speaker 5>for</v>

1510
01:24:51.740 --> 01:24:52.680
<v Speaker 5>changing my life.</v>

1511
01:24:52.770 --> 01:24:54.250
<v Speaker 5>They're not as much changes.</v>

1512
01:24:54.251 --> 01:24:56.370
<v Speaker 5>There has been a certain</v>

1513
01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:02.610
<v Speaker 5>breakfast as</v>

1514
01:25:16.690 --> 01:25:17.523
<v Speaker 5>well.</v>

1515
01:25:18.030 --> 01:25:18.863
<v Speaker 5>What I'm</v>

1516
01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:22.473
<v Speaker 5>getting</v>

1517
01:25:23.690 --> 01:25:24.523
<v Speaker 5>from</v>

1518
01:25:26.230 --> 01:25:27.063
<v Speaker 5>twitter,</v>

1519
01:25:31.230 --> 01:25:32.063
<v Speaker 5>especially</v>

1520
01:25:37.770 --> 01:25:41.730
<v Speaker 5>twitter requires at the end of the day that's bad.</v>

1521
01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:50.280
<v Speaker 5>You should watch and wait until the correct thing is to say that's what you</v>

1522
01:25:51.940 --> 01:25:53.860
<v Speaker 5>should have.</v>

1523
01:25:53.910 --> 01:25:54.440
<v Speaker 5>Great piece.</v>

1524
01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:55.840
<v Speaker 5>I think we should just quit.</v>

1525
01:25:56.740 --> 01:25:59.240
<v Speaker 5>One of the things I've learned that it's perhaps</v>

1526
01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:07.360
<v Speaker 5>you know versus what you should do when people attack,</v>

1527
01:26:07.450 --> 01:26:12.020
<v Speaker 5>you can try to make it real number of kids.</v>

1528
01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:17.800
<v Speaker 5>You always use necessary force to basically move</v>

1529
01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:26.080
<v Speaker 5>necessarily forced to defend yourself because why would you say people are</v>

1530
01:26:27.010 --> 01:26:28.530
<v Speaker 5>forced to not</v>

1531
01:26:30.930 --> 01:26:33.050
<v Speaker 5>miss any situations?</v>

1532
01:26:33.070 --> 01:26:33.903
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1533
01:26:34.310 --> 01:26:38.810
<v Speaker 5>because the situations where I kept my head when things are uncomfortable in the</v>

1534
01:26:38.811 --> 01:26:42.950
<v Speaker 5>student demonstrations in some of those that are comfortable and it was pretty</v>

1535
01:26:43.150 --> 01:26:44.390
<v Speaker 5>severely.</v>

1536
01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:47.530
<v Speaker 5>There were some people in those demonstrations,</v>

1537
01:26:48.430 --> 01:26:53.430
<v Speaker 5>there was a small minority of the people and we're definitely aiming at making</v>

1538
01:26:53.931 --> 01:26:55.450
<v Speaker 5>the world a hell of a lot worse.</v>

1539
01:26:55.530 --> 01:27:00.530
<v Speaker 5>It was the blow in and they're are of people that you want to have an arts</v>

1540
01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:02.753
<v Speaker 5>reaching</v>

1541
01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:08.330
<v Speaker 5>the right responses to react with,</v>

1542
01:27:09.220 --> 01:27:14.220
<v Speaker 5>react in a minimal way and still putting your ground and what's happened as a</v>

1543
01:27:14.721 --> 01:27:19.721
<v Speaker 5>consequence of implementing that as far as I can tell is that every time you tap</v>

1544
01:27:22.430 --> 01:27:26.120
<v Speaker 5>in that map in public if consequences,</v>

1545
01:27:26.170 --> 01:27:30.010
<v Speaker 5>that has ended up being good for me and so that's the interesting</v>

1546
01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:35.593
<v Speaker 5>part</v>

1547
01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:41.440
<v Speaker 5>because he was.</v>

1548
01:27:41.940 --> 01:27:43.460
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't that art</v>

1549
01:27:45.310 --> 01:27:46.143
<v Speaker 5>because</v>

1550
01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:52.100
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what you think you're talking to and it's certainly not me.</v>

1551
01:27:54.860 --> 01:27:55.610
<v Speaker 5>Someone that was.</v>

1552
01:27:55.610 --> 01:27:56.910
<v Speaker 5>It was like watching somebody</v>

1553
01:28:01.580 --> 01:28:02.590
<v Speaker 5>jogging to.</v>

1554
01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:14.500
<v Speaker 5>Fortunately I didn't react except minimally and that really work and so it's a</v>

1555
01:28:19.371 --> 01:28:20.600
<v Speaker 5>good thing to learn.</v>

1556
01:28:20.910 --> 01:28:22.130
<v Speaker 5>If you can learn to do with.</v>

1557
01:28:22.700 --> 01:28:26.160
<v Speaker 5>It's hard because if you're being attacked</v>

1558
01:28:27.940 --> 01:28:29.330
<v Speaker 5>and if they completely.</v>

1559
01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:32.160
<v Speaker 5>You don't have to do that.</v>

1560
01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:35.990
<v Speaker 5>You just asked sufficiently</v>

1561
01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.070
<v Speaker 5>and so when you see npcs,</v>

1562
01:28:40.350 --> 01:28:44.550
<v Speaker 5>you experienced that packet pressure in your life that you want to stand.</v>

1563
01:28:44.580 --> 01:28:49.310
<v Speaker 5>Your brother's been necessary for us as the most effective possible strategies</v>

1564
01:28:49.311 --> 01:28:50.144
<v Speaker 5>for a second.</v>

1565
01:28:50.330 --> 01:28:53.780
<v Speaker 5>What about the other words that just describe the people that get that look.</v>

1566
01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:56.870
<v Speaker 5>Just showing you the university</v>

1567
01:28:59.790 --> 01:29:00.890
<v Speaker 5>truly scared.</v>

1568
01:29:07.730 --> 01:29:08.563
<v Speaker 5>That's</v>

1569
01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:10.513
<v Speaker 5>awesome.</v>

1570
01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:20.650
<v Speaker 5>You try to get yourself</v>

1571
01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:27.090
<v Speaker 5>in a manner that's generated with a number of people possible,</v>

1572
01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:33.000
<v Speaker 5>and so if we seriously gave me a destruction of eventual destruction,</v>

1573
01:29:36.030 --> 01:29:37.180
<v Speaker 5>the best allison</v>

1574
01:29:41.010 --> 01:29:42.380
<v Speaker 5>rush toward the.</v>

1575
01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:43.733
<v Speaker 5>It's</v>

1576
01:29:46.810 --> 01:29:47.643
<v Speaker 5>hard.</v>

1577
01:29:49.300 --> 01:29:52.070
<v Speaker 5>It's hard to defeat someone who knows nothing.</v>

1578
01:29:52.670 --> 01:29:53.503
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

1579
01:29:56.400 --> 01:29:57.480
<v Speaker 5>what advice do you have?</v>

1580
01:29:58.030 --> 01:30:00.410
<v Speaker 5>His father's passed away while being</v>

1581
01:30:02.610 --> 01:30:04.520
<v Speaker 5>traded to the company.</v>

1582
01:30:08.810 --> 01:30:12.720
<v Speaker 5>You could say the spirit is everywhere.</v>

1583
01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:17.740
<v Speaker 5>One of the things that I</v>

1584
01:30:20.460 --> 01:30:21.870
<v Speaker 5>was that</v>

1585
01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:26.120
<v Speaker 5>breach cigarettes,</v>

1586
01:30:26.150 --> 01:30:26.770
<v Speaker 5>the father,</v>

1587
01:30:26.770 --> 01:30:27.060
<v Speaker 5>us.</v>

1588
01:30:27.060 --> 01:30:29.890
<v Speaker 5>Everywhere in the libraries</v>

1589
01:30:32.220 --> 01:30:37.220
<v Speaker 5>you can choose your heroes and mentors from the people,</v>

1590
01:30:37.710 --> 01:30:38.543
<v Speaker 5>whoever,</v>

1591
01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:43.620
<v Speaker 5>and so the prompts of institute as mature anyway,</v>

1592
01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:44.641
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>

1593
01:30:44.641 --> 01:30:47.490
<v Speaker 5>You have a personal father.</v>

1594
01:30:47.790 --> 01:30:51.490
<v Speaker 5>That's another reason why this notion of it</v>

1595
01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:58.640
<v Speaker 5>detached from reality feel that</v>

1596
01:31:01.710 --> 01:31:03.660
<v Speaker 5>transcended immediately.</v>

1597
01:31:04.280 --> 01:31:05.011
<v Speaker 5>So you might say,</v>

1598
01:31:05.011 --> 01:31:05.221
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1599
01:31:05.221 --> 01:31:07.880
<v Speaker 5>it's incumbent on you to worship this part of,</v>

1600
01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:09.353
<v Speaker 5>what do you mean?</v>

1601
01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:10.333
<v Speaker 5>Psychological</v>

1602
01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:13.650
<v Speaker 5>assessment,</v>

1603
01:31:13.650 --> 01:31:15.350
<v Speaker 5>the spirit as a pattern.</v>

1604
01:31:15.530 --> 01:31:20.530
<v Speaker 5>The pattern is generating civilization and you even conceptualize that.</v>

1605
01:31:20.821 --> 01:31:25.030
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty easy to conceptualize that as a journalist being a spirit,</v>

1606
01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:25.873
<v Speaker 5>that's something</v>

1607
01:31:27.210 --> 01:31:32.010
<v Speaker 5>experience something like making more than that and some more</v>

1608
01:31:33.740 --> 01:31:36.940
<v Speaker 5>on the rails and the way people used to.</v>

1609
01:31:37.310 --> 01:31:38.210
<v Speaker 5>I'm looking at</v>

1610
01:31:39.960 --> 01:31:44.010
<v Speaker 5>because that's another really interesting thing about people and interesting</v>

1611
01:31:44.011 --> 01:31:48.580
<v Speaker 5>thing that you and yourself and you notice how you react in the world in the</v>

1612
01:31:48.581 --> 01:31:49.414
<v Speaker 5>middle</v>

1613
01:31:50.690 --> 01:31:55.590
<v Speaker 5>or the actions of the people that Meyer and it isn't like you're doing that</v>

1614
01:31:55.610 --> 01:31:56.720
<v Speaker 5>voluntarily.</v>

1615
01:31:57.090 --> 01:32:01.100
<v Speaker 5>It's like you just noticed that that's in some sense.</v>

1616
01:32:01.170 --> 01:32:02.920
<v Speaker 5>That's the instinct to worship.</v>

1617
01:32:05.410 --> 01:32:08.740
<v Speaker 5>Worship is the instinct we imitate which it is,</v>

1618
01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:12.000
<v Speaker 5>and if the instinct to empathy is work,</v>

1619
01:32:12.260 --> 01:32:13.600
<v Speaker 5>which it is,</v>

1620
01:32:13.690 --> 01:32:18.690
<v Speaker 5>then the fact that you can be gracious is the way you bet your unconscious line</v>

1621
01:32:20.530 --> 01:32:21.820
<v Speaker 5>oreos with words,</v>

1622
01:32:21.850 --> 01:32:26.230
<v Speaker 5>good world crips outside of an architect works.</v>

1623
01:32:26.480 --> 01:32:26.860
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1624
01:32:26.860 --> 01:32:27.530
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1625
01:32:27.530 --> 01:32:29.290
<v Speaker 5>not that I'm really fascinated.</v>

1626
01:32:29.700 --> 01:32:34.700
<v Speaker 5>Got a trap line out and I'll focus on them and it is attempting to do something</v>

1627
01:32:36.251 --> 01:32:37.084
<v Speaker 5>that happens.</v>

1628
01:32:37.410 --> 01:32:39.220
<v Speaker 5>You can also use that as a guy.</v>

1629
01:32:40.450 --> 01:32:45.450
<v Speaker 5>Talks a lot about this when very profound psychological transformation where you</v>

1630
01:32:47.321 --> 01:32:48.260
<v Speaker 5>spent talking to me</v>

1631
01:32:49.980 --> 01:32:51.890
<v Speaker 5>and he said the artist,</v>

1632
01:32:51.920 --> 01:32:56.920
<v Speaker 5>his transformation was his observation of people who dr themselves.</v>

1633
01:32:58.800 --> 01:32:59.570
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1634
01:32:59.570 --> 01:33:00.790
<v Speaker 5>what was impossible.</v>

1635
01:33:00.830 --> 01:33:01.663
<v Speaker 5>Nobility,</v>

1636
01:33:02.770 --> 01:33:04.930
<v Speaker 5>brutally difficult situations.</v>

1637
01:33:05.460 --> 01:33:06.293
<v Speaker 5>Now</v>

1638
01:33:08.020 --> 01:33:11.500
<v Speaker 5>I would say perhaps hundreds of stories of people like that,</v>

1639
01:33:11.501 --> 01:33:12.250
<v Speaker 5>that encounter.</v>

1640
01:33:12.250 --> 01:33:16.900
<v Speaker 5>He was in the council and so he started to notice that those people exist and</v>

1641
01:33:16.901 --> 01:33:20.850
<v Speaker 5>that there was something in him that was responding with the gardener</v>

1642
01:33:20.860 --> 01:33:21.910
<v Speaker 5>admiration,</v>

1643
01:33:22.570 --> 01:33:26.130
<v Speaker 5>who's incorporation that will completely transformed world.</v>

1644
01:33:27.010 --> 01:33:27.843
<v Speaker 5>And so that's,</v>

1645
01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:29.630
<v Speaker 5>that's the rediscovery of the fog.</v>

1646
01:33:29.710 --> 01:33:34.710
<v Speaker 5>That's part of the process of registering the fondant group wave it seems.</v>

1647
01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:37.390
<v Speaker 5>That's exactly what this question was asking.</v>

1648
01:33:37.420 --> 01:33:38.700
<v Speaker 5>This is what my understanding.</v>

1649
01:33:40.110 --> 01:33:41.690
<v Speaker 5>That's the question that's important.</v>

1650
01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:42.870
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1651
01:33:42.870 --> 01:33:46.000
<v Speaker 5>why don't you turn from the reverse with father to the spiritual,</v>

1652
01:33:46.930 --> 01:33:50.410
<v Speaker 5>which is something you have to do with your maturity when it's it goes or you</v>

1653
01:33:50.411 --> 01:33:55.310
<v Speaker 5>lose the spirit of is that if you don't replace your personal father with a</v>

1654
01:33:55.311 --> 01:33:57.430
<v Speaker 5>trans person before and your different mature,</v>

1655
01:33:59.270 --> 01:34:03.030
<v Speaker 5>your personal father who you essentially get psychological,</v>

1656
01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:06.560
<v Speaker 5>you got and you see people</v>

1657
01:34:08.450 --> 01:34:10.150
<v Speaker 5>when they're like 40 years old,</v>

1658
01:34:10.210 --> 01:34:14.320
<v Speaker 5>the reason they haven't taken the pattern of the spirit,</v>

1659
01:34:14.350 --> 01:34:19.350
<v Speaker 5>the father away from offered and putting it into the transcendent space where</v>

1660
01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:26.440
<v Speaker 5>there's tremendous utility in doing it and now say the in the metaphysics of the</v>

1661
01:34:26.441 --> 01:34:29.510
<v Speaker 5>spirit of that question,</v>

1662
01:34:29.770 --> 01:34:34.160
<v Speaker 5>so let's just go with the spirit middle somewhere and perhaps</v>

1663
01:34:35.910 --> 01:34:37.420
<v Speaker 5>there's something that even more,</v>

1664
01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:40.153
<v Speaker 5>and this is</v>

1665
01:34:42.960 --> 01:34:45.070
<v Speaker 5>the psychological idea of the transcendent.</v>

1666
01:34:45.070 --> 01:34:47.950
<v Speaker 5>The laundry is not something that you want to snap,</v>

1667
01:34:49.650 --> 01:34:50.500
<v Speaker 5>like look,</v>

1668
01:34:51.310 --> 01:34:56.310
<v Speaker 5>don't give precedent that of course the temptation is to become a chain</v>

1669
01:34:56.680 --> 01:34:57.513
<v Speaker 5>tensioner.</v>

1670
01:34:58.780 --> 01:35:03.780
<v Speaker 5>That was good because the person is the king indicate uses the reasons about</v>

1671
01:35:07.530 --> 01:35:10.970
<v Speaker 5>is because God is thought precedent.</v>

1672
01:35:11.370 --> 01:35:12.270
<v Speaker 5>Precedent is</v>

1673
01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:15.953
<v Speaker 5>God is</v>

1674
01:35:17.390 --> 01:35:18.530
<v Speaker 5>sovereign already.</v>

1675
01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:19.830
<v Speaker 5>It's.</v>

1676
01:35:19.830 --> 01:35:23.910
<v Speaker 5>It's the board with the idea of that's great.</v>

1677
01:35:24.590 --> 01:35:29.590
<v Speaker 5>Report is extracted away from any carrier and made a princess or the trend</v>

1678
01:35:30.710 --> 01:35:35.530
<v Speaker 5>principle and then the president is subordinate to that transcended principle</v>

1679
01:35:35.660 --> 01:35:39.100
<v Speaker 5>and that's been the case because otherwise that temptation is precedent.</v>

1680
01:35:39.110 --> 01:35:42.080
<v Speaker 5>Janie gone very bad idea.</v>

1681
01:35:44.620 --> 01:35:45.860
<v Speaker 5>Know We.</v>

1682
01:35:48.860 --> 01:35:52.480
<v Speaker 5>We're basically on page 10 of the essential points.</v>

1683
01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:56.000
<v Speaker 5>It was like being on task.</v>

1684
01:35:59.300 --> 01:36:00.133
<v Speaker 5>They were</v>

1685
01:36:01.150 --> 01:36:04.630
<v Speaker 5>really helpful and perhaps more than you think.</v>

1686
01:36:05.180 --> 01:36:06.013
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>

1687
01:36:06.230 --> 01:36:06.660
<v Speaker 5>Awesome.</v>

1688
01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:07.493
<v Speaker 5>That's very cool.</v>

1689
01:36:20.430 --> 01:36:21.530
<v Speaker 5>Good followup to that.</v>

1690
01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:22.680
<v Speaker 5>Do you ever,</v>

1691
01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:23.513
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1692
01:36:33.770 --> 01:36:34.603
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1693
01:36:51.380 --> 01:36:52.213
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1694
01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:00.313
<v Speaker 5>Nope.</v>

1695
01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:08.273
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1696
01:37:11.010 --> 01:37:11.843
<v Speaker 5>For me,</v>

1697
01:37:14.670 --> 01:37:15.910
<v Speaker 5>for me on the calls,</v>

1698
01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:16.833
<v Speaker 5>dangerous</v>

1699
01:37:24.430 --> 01:37:25.560
<v Speaker 5>legal impulsively.</v>

1700
01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:31.650
<v Speaker 5>I do also understand some scripts</v>

1701
01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:35.713
<v Speaker 5>for</v>

1702
01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:41.070
<v Speaker 5>smoking is probably the gate suicide.</v>

1703
01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:42.960
<v Speaker 5>I mean that was the whole story.</v>

1704
01:37:43.470 --> 01:37:44.030
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1705
01:37:44.030 --> 01:37:45.550
<v Speaker 5>I'd say that</v>

1706
01:37:47.380 --> 01:37:50.710
<v Speaker 5>means that in some sense it's careless thinking.</v>

1707
01:37:51.290 --> 01:37:53.220
<v Speaker 5>Everything has its risks.</v>

1708
01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:00.433
<v Speaker 5>Richard asked you</v>

1709
01:38:17.940 --> 01:38:19.330
<v Speaker 3>back to one of the rules.</v>

1710
01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:26.490
<v Speaker 3>You don't want people,</v>

1711
01:38:26.491 --> 01:38:27.930
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to just tell you those little</v>

1712
01:38:37.290 --> 01:38:38.320
<v Speaker 3>get here</v>

1713
01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:54.770
<v Speaker 5>that I drove.</v>

1714
01:38:54.780 --> 01:38:55.800
<v Speaker 5>The advice that I gave</v>

1715
01:39:04.570 --> 01:39:06.020
<v Speaker 5>was</v>

1716
01:39:08.930 --> 01:39:10.930
<v Speaker 5>about that age</v>

1717
01:39:13.430 --> 01:39:14.263
<v Speaker 5>60,</v>

1718
01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:17.280
<v Speaker 5>which is perfect for me for</v>

1719
01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:20.353
<v Speaker 5>my</v>

1720
01:39:22.570 --> 01:39:23.403
<v Speaker 5>depression,</v>

1721
01:39:24.260 --> 01:39:25.093
<v Speaker 5>depression</v>

1722
01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:29.890
<v Speaker 5>and my grandfather.</v>

1723
01:39:38.490 --> 01:39:40.160
<v Speaker 5>I asked my daughter,</v>

1724
01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:41.320
<v Speaker 5>my daughter has,</v>

1725
01:39:43.590 --> 01:39:44.660
<v Speaker 5>she has 38</v>

1726
01:39:49.580 --> 01:39:51.540
<v Speaker 5>when she was 16,</v>

1727
01:39:51.541 --> 01:39:56.270
<v Speaker 5>she had her hip replaced after walking around with</v>

1728
01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:02.280
<v Speaker 5>and she also has this impression</v>

1729
01:40:04.650 --> 01:40:05.910
<v Speaker 5>when that happened,</v>

1730
01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:09.790
<v Speaker 5>if she removed one of her illnesses,</v>

1731
01:40:09.910 --> 01:40:10.743
<v Speaker 5>I</v>

1732
01:40:12.750 --> 01:40:16.110
<v Speaker 5>which one would be removed and she said it,</v>

1733
01:40:19.790 --> 01:40:24.530
<v Speaker 5>she would keep the arthritis and so that gives you some indication.</v>

1734
01:40:24.980 --> 01:40:27.330
<v Speaker 5>That impression is mine</v>

1735
01:40:29.820 --> 01:40:30.750
<v Speaker 5>was brutally hard.</v>

1736
01:40:31.090 --> 01:40:32.560
<v Speaker 5>My father pointed remarks</v>

1737
01:40:34.740 --> 01:40:35.573
<v Speaker 5>anyways,</v>

1738
01:40:36.870 --> 01:40:37.820
<v Speaker 5>so I'm</v>

1739
01:40:39.850 --> 01:40:42.350
<v Speaker 5>feeling pretty miserable face.</v>

1740
01:40:44.290 --> 01:40:45.140
<v Speaker 5>What's that?</v>

1741
01:40:47.500 --> 01:40:52.500
<v Speaker 5>There were a bunch of things that are wrong and then I can try to stop them and</v>

1742
01:40:53.651 --> 01:40:56.970
<v Speaker 5>see what happened or the crispy exterior.</v>

1743
01:40:57.940 --> 01:40:59.770
<v Speaker 5>I know what I'm doing wrong.</v>

1744
01:40:59.780 --> 01:41:04.780
<v Speaker 5>Those obvious and they'll probably make my life worse than it has to be and</v>

1745
01:41:06.940 --> 01:41:11.350
<v Speaker 5>maybe there was 10 things that I remember fight contract that I'm sort of doing</v>

1746
01:41:11.351 --> 01:41:16.351
<v Speaker 5>wrong and I could start not doing those experiments and when I started,</v>

1747
01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:19.050
<v Speaker 5>but it was probably 20,</v>

1748
01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:21.273
<v Speaker 5>21.</v>

1749
01:41:21.370 --> 01:41:22.960
<v Speaker 5>Just what I went to graduate school.</v>

1750
01:41:22.961 --> 01:41:23.261
<v Speaker 5>I thought,</v>

1751
01:41:23.261 --> 01:41:23.531
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1752
01:41:23.531 --> 01:41:24.680
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to see what would happen,</v>

1753
01:41:24.690 --> 01:41:29.450
<v Speaker 5>and I just started doing all the things that I'm doing that are stupid that I</v>

1754
01:41:29.460 --> 01:41:30.700
<v Speaker 5>know where it's at.</v>

1755
01:41:30.860 --> 01:41:35.320
<v Speaker 5>The same time when I decided that was a strange experience and I need to go out</v>

1756
01:41:35.321 --> 01:41:37.370
<v Speaker 5>a little bit in the</v>

1757
01:41:39.700 --> 01:41:41.060
<v Speaker 5>maximum security prison.</v>

1758
01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:45.760
<v Speaker 5>Just this is the patients are very strange stuff.</v>

1759
01:41:52.340 --> 01:41:53.173
<v Speaker 2>Insurance</v>

1760
01:41:58.150 --> 01:41:58.983
<v Speaker 5>made</v>

1761
01:41:59.830 --> 01:42:01.160
<v Speaker 5>me think</v>

1762
01:42:03.370 --> 01:42:08.370
<v Speaker 5>about what I was saying and so at the same time I decided to stop doing the</v>

1763
01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:15.920
<v Speaker 5>stupid things I was doing that I knew that it was making it worse.</v>

1764
01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:21.040
<v Speaker 5>I was going to start saying things that might be true and that was also</v>

1765
01:42:21.271 --> 01:42:23.590
<v Speaker 5>extremely shocked because I'm really</v>

1766
01:42:25.260 --> 01:42:25.470
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1767
01:42:25.470 --> 01:42:26.460
<v Speaker 5>I really needed it.</v>

1768
01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:27.313
<v Speaker 5>I was going to be</v>

1769
01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:31.920
<v Speaker 5>safe myself on that.</v>

1770
01:42:32.330 --> 01:42:37.330
<v Speaker 5>It was very uncanny because over the four months almost a decision to revise,</v>

1771
01:42:38.590 --> 01:42:43.590
<v Speaker 5>like almost everything I said was the true 95 percent of it was for show people</v>

1772
01:42:46.690 --> 01:42:47.523
<v Speaker 5>for books.</v>

1773
01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:52.880
<v Speaker 5>You deserve things that I really didn't have just raised up shallow and deep</v>

1774
01:42:58.140 --> 01:43:02.500
<v Speaker 5>forms of self deception and I noticed that if I paid attention to what I'm</v>

1775
01:43:02.510 --> 01:43:03.343
<v Speaker 5>saying,</v>

1776
01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:08.010
<v Speaker 5>I could tell when being false because I've helped me.</v>

1777
01:43:08.170 --> 01:43:13.170
<v Speaker 5>He was talking to and so what I tried to list to only say things that it make me</v>

1778
01:43:14.821 --> 01:43:18.960
<v Speaker 5>feel and that was really extreme experience because to begin with almost</v>

1779
01:43:18.961 --> 01:43:19.381
<v Speaker 5>everything,</v>

1780
01:43:19.381 --> 01:43:20.214
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

1781
01:43:20.940 --> 01:43:21.773
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

1782
01:43:21.870 --> 01:43:24.600
<v Speaker 5>a case almost every week,</v>

1783
01:43:25.270 --> 01:43:26.820
<v Speaker 5>and it was a shock.</v>

1784
01:43:26.821 --> 01:43:27.211
<v Speaker 5>I thought,</v>

1785
01:43:27.211 --> 01:43:27.780
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1786
01:43:27.780 --> 01:43:29.640
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of insanity in both ways.</v>

1787
01:43:29.641 --> 01:43:29.960
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1788
01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:34.930
<v Speaker 5>is it the case that you're that false?</v>

1789
01:43:36.900 --> 01:43:41.350
<v Speaker 5>Which of these things that you believe the sense of falseness and put up with</v>

1790
01:43:41.370 --> 01:43:46.090
<v Speaker 5>the fact that 95 percent you're doing this all certainly you put up with</v>

1791
01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:50.960
<v Speaker 5>and I just started that written and</v>

1792
01:43:53.070 --> 01:43:55.200
<v Speaker 5>that's a good thing.</v>

1793
01:43:56.730 --> 01:43:58.090
<v Speaker 5>It's changed me,</v>

1794
01:43:59.180 --> 01:44:00.140
<v Speaker 5>almost completely</v>

1795
01:44:06.180 --> 01:44:07.370
<v Speaker 5>use.</v>

1796
01:44:08.790 --> 01:44:10.320
<v Speaker 5>It's also helped me</v>

1797
01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:13.593
<v Speaker 5>write</v>

1798
01:44:18.430 --> 01:44:19.263
<v Speaker 5>this</v>

1799
01:44:21.860 --> 01:44:23.670
<v Speaker 5>sentence that I</v>

1800
01:44:26.210 --> 01:44:27.043
<v Speaker 5>read</v>

1801
01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:29.273
<v Speaker 5>it</v>

1802
01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:34.110
<v Speaker 5>wrong and it's</v>

1803
01:44:36.870 --> 01:44:38.930
<v Speaker 5>wrong anyway.</v>

1804
01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:41.030
<v Speaker 5>I can get underneath it and try it out.</v>

1805
01:44:43.190 --> 01:44:46.370
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't challenge and so that's</v>

1806
01:44:50.060 --> 01:44:51.050
<v Speaker 5>500 page book.</v>

1807
01:44:51.051 --> 01:44:52.580
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of sentences,</v>

1808
01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:56.263
<v Speaker 5>consequences.</v>

1809
01:45:00.420 --> 01:45:01.910
<v Speaker 5>Even during these times.</v>

1810
01:45:02.680 --> 01:45:05.460
<v Speaker 5>You're still there.</v>

1811
01:45:11.970 --> 01:45:12.230
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1812
01:45:12.230 --> 01:45:14.970
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately when we</v>

1813
01:45:16.510 --> 01:45:17.343
<v Speaker 3>were</v>

1814
01:45:19.380 --> 01:45:20.470
<v Speaker 3>meeting with the Queen,</v>

1815
01:45:23.860 --> 01:45:26.700
<v Speaker 3>but my brother in law and sister in</v>

1816
01:45:29.210 --> 01:45:34.210
<v Speaker 3>what this whole experience has been like for me,</v>

1817
01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:36.780
<v Speaker 3>I feel like now I'm on this jury.</v>

1818
01:45:38.590 --> 01:45:40.770
<v Speaker 3>At the end of yours will be the.</v>

1819
01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:42.830
<v Speaker 3>I think that's exactly right.</v>

1820
01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:47.393
<v Speaker 2>Yes sir.</v>

1821
01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:00.940
<v Speaker 3>I just love being honest.</v>
