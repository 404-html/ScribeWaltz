00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:07.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.900
<v Speaker 1>what happened as far as I can understand it,</v>

3
00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.120
<v Speaker 1>some financial wizards figured out that by bundling mortgages together,</v>

4
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.740
<v Speaker 1>you could calculate their average riskiness and then you could discount them</v>

5
00:00:18.741 --> 00:00:21.980
<v Speaker 1>according to that riskiness and then you could sell them as high grade</v>

6
00:00:21.981 --> 00:00:22.820
<v Speaker 1>investments.</v>

7
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.460
<v Speaker 1>And the regulatory agencies went along with that.</v>

8
00:00:25.461 --> 00:00:29.570
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly because they're generally staffed by people who aren't as</v>

9
00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:33.440
<v Speaker 1>smart as the people who were manipulating the monetary system for obvious</v>

10
00:00:33.441 --> 00:00:34.274
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>

11
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.420
<v Speaker 1>And it was brilliant.</v>

12
00:00:35.421 --> 00:00:39.020
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense that if you take a bunch of risky investments that you can and</v>

13
00:00:39.021 --> 00:00:40.880
<v Speaker 1>you can calculate the risk and discounted,</v>

14
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.080
<v Speaker 1>then you stabilize.</v>

15
00:00:42.081 --> 00:00:43.280
<v Speaker 1>It gets brilliant.</v>

16
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.690
<v Speaker 1>Except for one thing,</v>

17
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.560
<v Speaker 1>they didn't calculate the fact that everything could collapse it once.</v>

18
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.420
<v Speaker 1>Now what happened was when they transformed these risky investments into stable</v>

19
00:00:53.421 --> 00:00:54.254
<v Speaker 1>investments,</v>

20
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.370
<v Speaker 1>they got really valuable.</v>

21
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.970
<v Speaker 1>And so it was worthwhile for the banks to give mortgages to everybody that could</v>

22
00:00:58.971 --> 00:01:00.110
<v Speaker 1>possibly process.</v>

23
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.400
<v Speaker 1>And that's where the crookedness started.</v>

24
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.500
<v Speaker 1>Dis CPM,</v>

25
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.471
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:01:03.471 --> 00:01:04.304
<v Speaker 1>they thought,</v>

27
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:04.640
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

28
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.640
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter how risky be mortgage is because we'll average that out</v>

29
00:01:09.771 --> 00:01:11.990
<v Speaker 1>anyways and we're going to make money on that.</v>

30
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.460
<v Speaker 1>On the trash.</v>

31
00:01:13.461 --> 00:01:15.710
<v Speaker 1>I think they were called brilliant,</v>

32
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.010
<v Speaker 1>except for the one thing that no one expected,</v>

33
00:01:19.011 --> 00:01:22.190
<v Speaker 1>which was that the whole bloody market could collapse at once.</v>

34
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.661
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

35
00:01:23.661 --> 00:01:24.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.951
<v Speaker 1>you can think,</v>

37
00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:25.101
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

38
00:01:25.101 --> 00:01:26.210
<v Speaker 1>it's obvious in retrospect,</v>

39
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.320
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

40
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.153
<v Speaker 1>no obvious,</v>

41
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.561
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

42
00:01:27.561 --> 00:01:31.220
<v Speaker 1>like the American housing market value peaked way below what the Japanese</v>

43
00:01:31.221 --> 00:01:32.600
<v Speaker 1>housing market had peaked out.</v>

44
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:33.080
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

45
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.050
<v Speaker 1>after you decades before it was nothing like it.</v>

46
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.471
<v Speaker 1>Jada,</v>

47
00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:40.790
<v Speaker 1>Japanese real estate market got inflated away past the American.</v>

48
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.170
<v Speaker 1>So now one,</v>

49
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.640
<v Speaker 1>you don't know where the talk is.</v>

50
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.253
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

51
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:46.231
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

52
00:01:46.231 --> 00:01:46.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.020
<v Speaker 1>the crookedness was</v>

54
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.060
<v Speaker 1>people's failure to play by standard rules of risk evaluation.</v>

55
00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.310
<v Speaker 1>But even that's complicated because they thought,</v>

56
00:01:59.311 --> 00:01:59.461
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

57
00:01:59.461 --> 00:02:00.900
<v Speaker 1>maybe these rules don't apply anymore.</v>

58
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.370
<v Speaker 1>And that's what the guys who were making these bundled investments we're trying</v>

59
00:02:05.371 --> 00:02:05.671
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

60
00:02:05.671 --> 00:02:09.300
<v Speaker 1>They were trying to make the old rules not apply anymore by eradicating the risk</v>

61
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:11.123
<v Speaker 1>didn't work.</v>

62
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.803
<v Speaker 1>Was it crooked?</v>

63
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.613
<v Speaker 1>Probably.</v>

64
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:17.880
<v Speaker 1>It's not so obvious though.</v>
