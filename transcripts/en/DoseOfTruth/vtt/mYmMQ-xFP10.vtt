00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.480
<v Speaker 1>I want to begin with something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Churchill wrote in the 19 thirties and</v>

2
00:00:12.271 --> 00:00:16.210
<v Speaker 1>he said this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the signs of a great society uses</v>

3
00:00:16.211 --> 00:00:20.610
<v Speaker 1>a diligence with which it passes culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>from one generation to the next.</v>

4
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.340
<v Speaker 1>When one generation no longer passages</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the things that are dear to it,</v>

5
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.010
<v Speaker 1>its heroes and they stories and its</v>
<v Speaker 1>religious faith.</v>

6
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.990
<v Speaker 1>It's in effect saying that past is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>void.</v>

7
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.990
<v Speaker 1>It's of no value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes on to say that leaves young</v>

8
00:00:39.991 --> 00:00:44.991
<v Speaker 1>people feeling a lack of direction and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lack of purpose and opens them to the</v>

9
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.940
<v Speaker 1>dictum of Karl Marx that are people</v>
<v Speaker 1>derived of the history,</v>

10
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.620
<v Speaker 1>easily persuaded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have we stripped down young people have</v>

11
00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.270
<v Speaker 1>purpose and meaning and left them open</v>
<v Speaker 1>to being bullied around whether there's</v>

12
00:01:00.271 --> 00:01:03.960
<v Speaker 1>two things about that that I think are</v>
<v Speaker 1>really worth worth laying out.</v>

13
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.170
<v Speaker 1>The for the first is an analysis of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose of memory.</v>

14
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.800
<v Speaker 1>Now because people think that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose of memory is to remember the</v>

15
00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:13.500
<v Speaker 1>past and that's not the purpose of</v>
<v Speaker 1>memory.</v>

16
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.870
<v Speaker 1>The purpose of memory is to extract out</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the past lessons to structure the</v>

17
00:01:18.871 --> 00:01:21.360
<v Speaker 1>future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the purpose of personal</v>

18
00:01:21.361 --> 00:01:24.870
<v Speaker 1>memory and so you're done with a memory</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you've extracted out the</v>

19
00:01:24.871 --> 00:01:27.600
<v Speaker 1>information that you can use to guide</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself properly in the future.</v>

20
00:01:27.601 --> 00:01:29.550
<v Speaker 1>So if you have a traumatic memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

21
00:01:29.551 --> 00:01:34.230
<v Speaker 1>that's really obsessing you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you analyze that memory to the point</v>

22
00:01:34.231 --> 00:01:38.310
<v Speaker 1>where you figured out how you put</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself at risk and you can determine</v>

23
00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:41.610
<v Speaker 1>how you might avoid that in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the emotion associated with that</v>

24
00:01:41.611 --> 00:01:44.910
<v Speaker 1>goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So memories are has a very pragmatic</v>

25
00:01:44.911 --> 00:01:49.320
<v Speaker 1>function and cultural memories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same thing is that we need to</v>

26
00:01:49.321 --> 00:01:53.340
<v Speaker 1>extract out stories from our past that</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure our future and we need that</v>

27
00:01:53.341 --> 00:01:56.700
<v Speaker 1>because first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have a purpose,</v>

28
00:01:56.701 --> 00:02:00.570
<v Speaker 1>let's say it isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that your life becomes neutral in a in a</v>

29
00:02:00.571 --> 00:02:02.010
<v Speaker 1>meaningless sentence.</v>

30
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.790
<v Speaker 1>It's that your life becomes</v>
<v Speaker 1>characterized by unbearable suffering</v>

31
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.020
<v Speaker 1>because the baseline condition of life</v>
<v Speaker 1>is something like unbearable suffering</v>

32
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.350
<v Speaker 1>and what you have to set against that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a noble and worthwhile purpose and</v>

33
00:02:15.631 --> 00:02:18.660
<v Speaker 1>hopefully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully your determination of that</v>

34
00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:22.260
<v Speaker 1>purpose is buttress to some degree by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wisdom of the past because you can't</v>

35
00:02:22.261 --> 00:02:24.030
<v Speaker 1>conjure something like that up on your</v>
<v Speaker 1>own,</v>

36
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.540
<v Speaker 1>and if you provide people with nobility</v>
<v Speaker 1>of purpose,</v>

37
00:02:27.541 --> 00:02:31.230
<v Speaker 1>then they can tolerate the suffering of</v>
<v Speaker 1>existence without becoming entirely</v>

38
00:02:31.231 --> 00:02:34.170
<v Speaker 1>corrupted by it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And cultures that don't do that,</v>

39
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.890
<v Speaker 1>it isn't even so much that they die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that cultures that don't do that</v>

40
00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:39.960
<v Speaker 1>are dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're done.</v>

41
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.590
<v Speaker 1>They don't have a story anymore and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have a call to adventure.</v>

42
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.470
<v Speaker 1>And then while then everyone suffers</v>
<v Speaker 1>stupidly.</v>

43
00:02:46.471 --> 00:02:48.600
<v Speaker 1>As a consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very bad thing.</v>

44
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.130
<v Speaker 1>So Churchill made the same observation</v>
<v Speaker 1>that many of the great psychologists and</v>

45
00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:55.410
<v Speaker 1>philosophers made in the early part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 20th century.</v>

46
00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.740
<v Speaker 1>It's like bringing this story forward</v>
<v Speaker 1>and and propagate it and make it the</v>

47
00:03:01.651 --> 00:03:05.520
<v Speaker 1>most noble possible story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you motivate people to do,</v>

48
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.040
<v Speaker 1>to transcend themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they need to do.</v>

49
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.760
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's exactly right in his diagnosis.</v>
