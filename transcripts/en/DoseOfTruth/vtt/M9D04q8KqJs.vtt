00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:02.500
<v Speaker 1>Lots of times when,</v>

2
00:00:02.501 --> 00:00:04.290
<v Speaker 1>when I'd been treating people for depression,</v>

3
00:00:04.291 --> 00:00:04.921
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

4
00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:05.754
<v Speaker 1>or anxiety,</v>

5
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.590
<v Speaker 1>they have existential issues.</v>

6
00:00:07.591 --> 00:00:07.961
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>

7
00:00:07.961 --> 00:00:09.960
<v Speaker 1>it's not just some psychiatric condition.</v>

8
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.220
<v Speaker 1>It's not just the third tapped off of normal because their brain chemistry is</v>

9
00:00:14.221 --> 00:00:14.660
<v Speaker 1>faulty.</v>

10
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:15.420
<v Speaker 1>Although,</v>

11
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:15.841
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:17.670
<v Speaker 1>sometimes that happens to be the case.</v>

13
00:00:17.671 --> 00:00:22.440
<v Speaker 1>It's that they are overwhelmed by the suffering and complexity of their life and</v>

14
00:00:22.441 --> 00:00:26.210
<v Speaker 1>they're not sure why it's reasonable to continue with it.</v>

15
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.461
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

16
00:00:26.461 --> 00:00:30.270
<v Speaker 1>that they can feel that terrible negative meanings of life,</v>

17
00:00:30.271 --> 00:00:34.200
<v Speaker 1>but are skeptical beyond belief about any of the positive meanings.</v>

18
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.520
<v Speaker 1>I had one client who was a very brilliant artist and as long as he didn't think</v>

19
00:00:38.521 --> 00:00:39.420
<v Speaker 1>he was fine,</v>

20
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:00:39.691 --> 00:00:43.140
<v Speaker 1>because he'd go and create and who is really good at being an artist,</v>

22
00:00:43.141 --> 00:00:43.620
<v Speaker 1>he just,</v>

23
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:43.831
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:00:43.831 --> 00:00:47.970
<v Speaker 1>he had that personality that was continually creative and quite brilliant.</v>

25
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.530
<v Speaker 1>Although he was self denigrating and,</v>

26
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.100
<v Speaker 1>but as soon as he started to think about what he was doing,</v>

27
00:00:53.101 --> 00:00:53.400
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>

28
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.701
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:00:53.701 --> 00:00:54.270
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

30
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.103
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

31
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:56.743
<v Speaker 1>it's like a,</v>

32
00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.850
<v Speaker 1>like a drill or a thought or something like that.</v>

33
00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:03.870
<v Speaker 1>He'd saw the branch off that he was sitting on because he'd start to criticize</v>

34
00:01:03.871 --> 00:01:04.740
<v Speaker 1>what he was doing.</v>

35
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.060
<v Speaker 1>Even the utility of it,</v>

36
00:01:06.061 --> 00:01:08.160
<v Speaker 1>even though it was sort of self evidently useful,</v>

37
00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:09.480
<v Speaker 1>and then he would be,</v>

38
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.171
<v Speaker 1>then it would be very,</v>

39
00:01:10.171 --> 00:01:13.170
<v Speaker 1>very hard for him to even motivate himself to create.</v>

40
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:14.101
<v Speaker 1>And He,</v>

41
00:01:14.101 --> 00:01:14.280
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

42
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.200
<v Speaker 1>he always struck me as a good example of,</v>

43
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.933
<v Speaker 1>of</v>

44
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.110
<v Speaker 1>the consequences of having your rational intellect divorced in some way from</v>

45
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.100
<v Speaker 1>your being divorced enough so that it actually questions the utility of your</v>

46
00:01:29.101 --> 00:01:29.934
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>

47
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.500
<v Speaker 1>And it's not a good thing.</v>

48
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.990
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good thing and it's,</v>

49
00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.700
<v Speaker 1>it's really not a good thing because it manifests itself not only an individual</v>

50
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.300
<v Speaker 1>psychopathology but also in social psychopathology.</v>

51
00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:45.270
<v Speaker 1>And that's his proclivity of people to get tangled up in etiology.</v>
