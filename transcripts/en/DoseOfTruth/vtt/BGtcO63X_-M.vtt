<v Speaker 1>I read this interesting commentary a little while ago on a statement by Christ</v>

2
00:00:05.041 --> 00:00:06.000
<v Speaker 1>in the New Testament,</v>

3
00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:10.110
<v Speaker 1>and the statement generally interpreted is that the meek shall inherit the</v>

4
00:00:10.111 --> 00:00:10.411
<v Speaker 1>earth,</v>

5
00:00:10.411 --> 00:00:13.890
<v Speaker 1>but I was looking up the multiple translations of the word Meek,</v>

6
00:00:13.891 --> 00:00:17.340
<v Speaker 1>and meek is actually derived from a Greek word,</v>

7
00:00:17.341 --> 00:00:18.174
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

8
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.800
<v Speaker 1>because the Bible,</v>

9
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.740
<v Speaker 1>at least some of the original forms of the Bible were in Greek.</v>

10
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.113
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

11
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.420
<v Speaker 1>and that word didn't exactly mean meek.</v>

12
00:00:27.421 --> 00:00:28.470
<v Speaker 1>It meant something like</v>

13
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.170
<v Speaker 1>those who have weapons and the ability to use them,</v>

14
00:00:36.171 --> 00:00:37.004
<v Speaker 1>but cert,</v>

15
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.430
<v Speaker 1>but determined to keep the machines will inherit the world.</v>

16
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
<v Speaker 1>And that means that people who are capable of force,</v>

17
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.113
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

18
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.560
<v Speaker 1>but decided not to use it,</v>

19
00:00:48.561 --> 00:00:51.230
<v Speaker 1>are in the proper moral position.</v>
