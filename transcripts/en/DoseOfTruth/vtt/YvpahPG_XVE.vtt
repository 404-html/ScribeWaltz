00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.360
<v Speaker 1>Any advice for a grieving parent who lost a child unexpectedly?</v>

2
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:13.251
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3
00:00:13.251 --> 00:00:16.670
<v Speaker 1>one I would say make sure that you turn to the people that you have left that</v>

4
00:00:16.671 --> 00:00:17.504
<v Speaker 1>you love.</v>

5
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.070
<v Speaker 1>The second I would say is don't be guilty about grieving.</v>

6
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:23.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

7
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.340
<v Speaker 1>and if you have friends,</v>

8
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.690
<v Speaker 1>you can tell them,</v>

9
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.430
<v Speaker 1>you could let them do something nice for you because they would like that you</v>

10
00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:33.920
<v Speaker 1>can figure out something they could do that would be nice,</v>

11
00:00:33.921 --> 00:00:35.900
<v Speaker 1>that you would appreciate and let them do it.</v>

12
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.951
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>

13
00:00:36.951 --> 00:00:40.370
<v Speaker 1>other people are going to grieve at some point in the future too.</v>

14
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.940
<v Speaker 1>And maybe they'll be able to ask you for help if you do that.</v>

15
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.133
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

16
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.080
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

17
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.341
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

18
00:00:50.341 --> 00:00:52.350
<v Speaker 1>the next thing I would say is give yourself time.</v>

19
00:00:52.351 --> 00:00:52.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

20
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.030
<v Speaker 1>it takes a year,</v>

21
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.520
<v Speaker 1>maybe longer to adapt,</v>

22
00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.330
<v Speaker 1>to adjust even reasonably to such a catastrophic loss.</v>

23
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.110
<v Speaker 1>And then I would say try not to allow that terrible wound to make you bitter</v>

24
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.040
<v Speaker 1>because then not only will you have lost your child and grieve,</v>

25
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.910
<v Speaker 1>but you'll be bitter and then you'll be resentful and then you'll be hateful.</v>

26
00:01:26.911 --> 00:01:28.440
<v Speaker 1>And that'll be like a terrible,</v>

27
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.900
<v Speaker 1>that'll add insult to injury,</v>

28
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.900
<v Speaker 1>so that's too bad.</v>
