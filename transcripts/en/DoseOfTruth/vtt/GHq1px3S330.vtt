1
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.440
<v Speaker 1>How's the online personality tests coming along?</v>

2
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.070
<v Speaker 1>It's coming along pretty well.</v>

3
00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:17.640
<v Speaker 1>We have all the reports written and we have the,</v>

4
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.823
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.720
<v Speaker 1>the underlying computer architecture finished.</v>

6
00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:24.570
<v Speaker 1>And at the moment we're just polishing it up essentially.</v>

7
00:00:24.571 --> 00:00:29.571
<v Speaker 1>And we're hoping that you'll be able to get a very detailed description of all</v>

8
00:00:30.391 --> 00:00:32.310
<v Speaker 1>five of the big five traits,</v>

9
00:00:32.311 --> 00:00:32.611
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

10
00:00:32.611 --> 00:00:33.480
<v Speaker 1>Extroversion.</v>

11
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.400
<v Speaker 1>That's a positive emotion dimension.</v>

12
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:36.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

13
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.110
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

14
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.110
<v Speaker 1>that will break down into enthusiasm and assertiveness and neuroticism.</v>

15
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.220
<v Speaker 1>Now it breaks down into withdrawal.</v>

16
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.750
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're in a state of withdrawal,</v>

17
00:00:45.751 --> 00:00:48.330
<v Speaker 1>then you're frozen with fear and,</v>

18
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.890
<v Speaker 1>and don't want to do anything.</v>

19
00:00:49.891 --> 00:00:50.910
<v Speaker 1>You're afraid to go out.</v>

20
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:51.480
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

21
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.170
<v Speaker 1>you're afraid to engage in any complex task because you might fail.</v>

22
00:00:55.171 --> 00:00:56.790
<v Speaker 1>You'll dealt yourself intensely.</v>

23
00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.250
<v Speaker 1>That's withdrawal in neuroticism.</v>

24
00:00:59.251 --> 00:01:02.910
<v Speaker 1>And then volatility is that kind of impulsive touchiness that people often</v>

25
00:01:02.911 --> 00:01:04.320
<v Speaker 1>develop when they're in a bad mood.</v>

26
00:01:04.321 --> 00:01:04.531
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

27
00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:06.540
<v Speaker 1>where if you reach your finger off to touch them,</v>

28
00:01:06.541 --> 00:01:08.070
<v Speaker 1>they'll flinch and maybe slap you.</v>

29
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.810
<v Speaker 1>And they're over sensitive to small slights and they don't have much of a sense</v>

30
00:01:12.811 --> 00:01:13.644
<v Speaker 1>of humor.</v>

31
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:14.653
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

32
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.700
<v Speaker 1>and agreeableness that subdivides into compassion and politeness and the liberal</v>

33
00:01:19.861 --> 00:01:22.350
<v Speaker 1>types are more compassionate and the,</v>

34
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:23.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.790
<v Speaker 1>conservative types are more polite and politeness seems to be something like</v>

36
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.410
<v Speaker 1>acting in accordance with the social norms governing interpersonal interaction.</v>

37
00:01:31.411 --> 00:01:36.411
<v Speaker 1>Whereas compassion seems to be the proclivity to side with the weakest party,</v>

38
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.470
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

39
00:01:37.471 --> 00:01:42.471
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's the primary maternal dimension because the perhaps alone with</v>

40
00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:46.590
<v Speaker 1>higher levels of negative emotion because,</v>

41
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.880
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

42
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.400
<v Speaker 1>it's obviously the case that when you're dealing with children,</v>

43
00:01:50.401 --> 00:01:51.540
<v Speaker 1>especially infants,</v>

44
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.980
<v Speaker 1>that you should take the side of the weaker party pretty much no matter what the</v>

45
00:01:55.981 --> 00:02:00.720
<v Speaker 1>logical argument and sprite because an infant who's crying is always right,</v>

46
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.790
<v Speaker 1>especially if it's under a year old.</v>

47
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.770
<v Speaker 1>There's no logic to it.</v>

48
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:05.100
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

49
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.700
<v Speaker 1>it's an a priori fact that a crying infant is correct.</v>

50
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:13.230
<v Speaker 1>And so we don't know how that translates into the political sphere because the</v>

51
00:02:13.231 --> 00:02:15.030
<v Speaker 1>most direct translation would be,</v>

52
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

53
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.750
<v Speaker 1>a complaining person is always right.</v>

54
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.281
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

55
00:02:20.281 --> 00:02:22.440
<v Speaker 1>I see that manifesting itself.</v>

56
00:02:22.441 --> 00:02:23.520
<v Speaker 1>I would say great.</v>

57
00:02:23.521 --> 00:02:27.840
<v Speaker 1>Clearly in the politically correct domain is that you always side with the</v>

58
00:02:27.841 --> 00:02:30.600
<v Speaker 1>person who's manifesting negative emotion.</v>

59
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.220
<v Speaker 1>And you always assume that there is an external reason that needs to be</v>

60
00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:36.570
<v Speaker 1>rectified in order to,</v>

61
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.800
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

62
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.581
<v Speaker 1>to deal with that.</v>

63
00:02:38.581 --> 00:02:39.630
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

64
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.500
<v Speaker 1>it isn't obvious to me that agreeableness as an ethic is something that is</v>

65
00:02:43.501 --> 00:02:46.620
<v Speaker 1>transformable into the political or the adult landscape.</v>

66
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.580
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

67
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.413
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

68
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.590
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

69
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.423
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

70
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.300
<v Speaker 1>we don't know these sorts of things and we can't even talk about them because</v>

71
00:02:54.301 --> 00:02:59.301
<v Speaker 1>people automatically assume that that's sexist or misogynistic or even though</v>

72
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.021
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

73
00:03:00.021 --> 00:03:03.670
<v Speaker 1>there are agreeable manner as well as a group of women because men are quite um,</v>

74
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.590
<v Speaker 1>maternal for,</v>

75
00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:06.070
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

76
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.100
<v Speaker 1>for the kind of large apes and mammals that we are.</v>

77
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.240
<v Speaker 1>But we need to take these sorts of things seriously because it isn't obvious to</v>

78
00:03:13.241 --> 00:03:17.940
<v Speaker 1>me that an ethic of agreeableness can govern a complex polity.</v>

79
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.640
<v Speaker 1>It looks to me more like conscientiousness is something that needs to govern</v>

80
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.480
<v Speaker 1>arm's length transactions and that sort of thing rather than treating everyone</v>

81
00:03:25.481 --> 00:03:28.450
<v Speaker 1>like Ken that you just can't do so you don't have the energy.</v>

82
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

83
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:30.341
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>

84
00:03:30.341 --> 00:03:34.930
<v Speaker 1>the test will also associate conscientious or assess conscientiousness.</v>

85
00:03:34.931 --> 00:03:36.310
<v Speaker 1>That's orderliness,</v>

86
00:03:36.311 --> 00:03:38.590
<v Speaker 1>which is seems to be associated with disgust,</v>

87
00:03:38.591 --> 00:03:43.591
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity and is a good predictor of conservative belief and industriousness,</v>

88
00:03:43.781 --> 00:03:45.340
<v Speaker 1>which is something like the,</v>

89
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.680
<v Speaker 1>well it's what it says exactly.</v>

90
00:03:47.681 --> 00:03:52.681
<v Speaker 1>It's the proclivity to engage in effortful work towards a defined goal in a</v>

91
00:03:52.811 --> 00:03:56.860
<v Speaker 1>reliable manner and it's the second best predictor of longterm life success</v>

92
00:03:56.861 --> 00:03:57.760
<v Speaker 1>after Iq.</v>

93
00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.770
<v Speaker 1>And then the final thing it'll upset,</v>

94
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.100
<v Speaker 1>assessed is openness to experience,</v>

95
00:04:03.101 --> 00:04:05.590
<v Speaker 1>which is more or less half creativity.</v>

96
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.180
<v Speaker 1>It half interest in ideas.</v>

97
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.650
<v Speaker 1>And so if,</v>

98
00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.350
<v Speaker 1>if you take the test,</v>

99
00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:12.184
<v Speaker 1>you'll get a boat,</v>

100
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.930
<v Speaker 1>it's about a 10 page report and it gets quite detailed and it tells you where</v>

101
00:04:16.931 --> 00:04:21.610
<v Speaker 1>you fit on a percentile basis and what your strengths and weaknesses are going</v>

102
00:04:21.611 --> 00:04:21.851
<v Speaker 1>to be.</v>

103
00:04:21.851 --> 00:04:22.690
<v Speaker 1>As a consequence,</v>

104
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.830
<v Speaker 1>we're going to produce a couple's version so that two of you can take it and</v>

105
00:04:26.831 --> 00:04:30.400
<v Speaker 1>then you'll get a report that tells you how you're similar and different and</v>

106
00:04:30.401 --> 00:04:34.540
<v Speaker 1>where you're likely to have disagreements and agreements where it's going to be</v>

107
00:04:34.541 --> 00:04:36.730
<v Speaker 1>difficult to negotiate a consensus.</v>

108
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.030
<v Speaker 1>That'd be where your Wyatt widely different from one another on a trait.</v>

109
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.540
<v Speaker 1>Like it's hard for an extrovert and an introvert to come to an agreement about</v>

110
00:04:45.701 --> 00:04:48.580
<v Speaker 1>how much socializing they're going to do because the extrovert says,</v>

111
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.331
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

112
00:04:49.331 --> 00:04:51.520
<v Speaker 1>let's socialize all the time in the introvert says,</v>

113
00:04:51.521 --> 00:04:51.761
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

114
00:04:51.761 --> 00:04:52.001
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

115
00:04:52.001 --> 00:04:53.740
<v Speaker 1>once a year would be plenty for me.</v>

116
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.680
<v Speaker 1>And those aren't opinions right there.</v>

117
00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.930
<v Speaker 1>They're built in preferences that are far beneath the realm of opinion.</v>

118
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.240
<v Speaker 1>And if you're high in openness and your partner as low in openness,</v>

119
00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:08.710
<v Speaker 1>like you're going to be interested in the theater and arts and literature and</v>

120
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.850
<v Speaker 1>philosophy and,</v>

121
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.130
<v Speaker 1>and talking about ideas and,</v>

122
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.540
<v Speaker 1>and going to museums and not sort of thing and your partner,</v>

123
00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.740
<v Speaker 1>it's in some sense it will be like they are colorblind,</v>

124
00:05:17.741 --> 00:05:20.740
<v Speaker 1>they just won't find that sort of thing engaging and interesting at all.</v>

125
00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.210
<v Speaker 1>And you might be able to shift someone a little bit to a higher degree of</v>

126
00:05:25.211 --> 00:05:25.691
<v Speaker 1>openness,</v>

127
00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:26.220
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

128
00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.970
<v Speaker 1>it's not an easy thing to do.</v>

129
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.990
<v Speaker 1>And so we think in the literature seems to indicate that you should be fairly</v>

130
00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:35.950
<v Speaker 1>well matched on most of your traits with your partner,</v>

131
00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

132
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.770
<v Speaker 1>with the possible exception of neuroticism,</v>

133
00:05:38.771 --> 00:05:42.000
<v Speaker 1>because it isn't obvious that two people who are highly neurotic can get along.</v>

134
00:05:42.001 --> 00:05:42.370
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

135
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.210
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism is a pretty good predictor of marital unhappiness,</v>

136
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.790
<v Speaker 1>just like it's a good predictor of every other form of unhappiness.</v>

137
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.960
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
