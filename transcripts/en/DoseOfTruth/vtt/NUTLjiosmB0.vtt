1
00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:07.443
<v Speaker 1>So the Dallas,</v>

2
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:08.081
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

3
00:00:08.081 --> 00:00:09.280
<v Speaker 1>they represent the world</v>

4
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.860
<v Speaker 1>in terms that are quite similar to those that I just described for you.</v>

5
00:00:14.861 --> 00:00:17.980
<v Speaker 1>So that the doubt central Dow assemble is this one,</v>

6
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:23.170
<v Speaker 1>the Yin Yang symbol and Yang basically stands for order.</v>

7
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.951
<v Speaker 1>That's what it means.</v>

8
00:00:23.951 --> 00:00:26.110
<v Speaker 1>But it means all the things that I've listed there.</v>

9
00:00:26.111 --> 00:00:27.790
<v Speaker 1>It means order masculinity,</v>

10
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.751
<v Speaker 1>the daytime,</v>

11
00:00:28.751 --> 00:00:29.560
<v Speaker 1>the known,</v>

12
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.840
<v Speaker 1>it also means authoritarianism and fascism.</v>

13
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.050
<v Speaker 1>And then yen on the opposite side is chaos.</v>

14
00:00:35.051 --> 00:00:35.771
<v Speaker 1>Femininity,</v>

15
00:00:35.771 --> 00:00:36.340
<v Speaker 1>the night,</v>

16
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.210
<v Speaker 1>the unknown decadence denialism.</v>

17
00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
<v Speaker 1>And it's also a relationship between the conscious and unconscious.</v>

18
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.290
<v Speaker 1>The current consciousness is represented by light.</v>

19
00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:45.790
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is,</v>

20
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.990
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

21
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.490
<v Speaker 1>when are you conscious?</v>

22
00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.350
<v Speaker 1>Your conscious during the day,</v>

23
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.681
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

24
00:00:50.681 --> 00:00:51.400
<v Speaker 1>Cause we're,</v>

25
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.150
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

26
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.010
<v Speaker 1>we're creatures that live in the day.</v>

27
00:00:54.011 --> 00:00:55.480
<v Speaker 1>Unlike rats for example,</v>

28
00:00:55.481 --> 00:00:55.721
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:00:55.721 --> 00:00:56.554
<v Speaker 1>they live at night.</v>

30
00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.630
<v Speaker 1>So for us,</v>

31
00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.310
<v Speaker 1>consciousness is associated with enlightenment and illumination and daytime and</v>

32
00:01:03.311 --> 00:01:04.360
<v Speaker 1>sunrise and the,</v>

33
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.980
<v Speaker 1>and the bright noon sky.</v>

34
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.370
<v Speaker 1>And the unconscious is associated with the nighttime.</v>

35
00:01:08.371 --> 00:01:11.680
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that partly too is that your unconscious is actually a lot</v>

36
00:01:11.681 --> 00:01:12.610
<v Speaker 1>more active at night.</v>

37
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:13.391
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

38
00:01:13.391 --> 00:01:14.440
<v Speaker 1>that's when you dream.</v>

39
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.480
<v Speaker 1>And it's also the time when,</v>

40
00:01:16.481 --> 00:01:20.260
<v Speaker 1>if you're frightened of something or if you're depressed and ruminative the</v>

41
00:01:20.261 --> 00:01:23.410
<v Speaker 1>frightening thoughts and the depressing and ruminative thoughts are going to</v>

42
00:01:23.411 --> 00:01:24.220
<v Speaker 1>come up.</v>

43
00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:24.971
<v Speaker 1>So many,</v>

44
00:01:24.971 --> 00:01:28.330
<v Speaker 1>many people have the experience of waking up in a kind of,</v>

45
00:01:28.331 --> 00:01:30.700
<v Speaker 1>cause I called sweat at three in the morning and having,</v>

46
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:31.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

47
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.330
<v Speaker 1>nothing but it continual stream of worries run through their head.</v>

48
00:01:34.331 --> 00:01:37.870
<v Speaker 1>And there's pretty good evidence that a lot of what you're doing at night when</v>

49
00:01:37.871 --> 00:01:38.704
<v Speaker 1>you sleep,</v>

50
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.400
<v Speaker 1>when you're dreaming and when you're not dreaming is actually processing threat,</v>

51
00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:43.091
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

52
00:01:43.091 --> 00:01:44.860
<v Speaker 1>But most of the time you were asleep for that.</v>

53
00:01:44.861 --> 00:01:46.840
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you wake up during it and it's like,</v>

54
00:01:46.841 --> 00:01:47.350
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

55
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.420
<v Speaker 1>it's not something you really want to be conscious about.</v>

56
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.020
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

57
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.470
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

58
00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.281
<v Speaker 1>it's hard on you.</v>

59
00:01:51.281 --> 00:01:52.180
<v Speaker 1>And it's very,</v>

60
00:01:52.181 --> 00:01:54.040
<v Speaker 1>very common among people who are depressed,</v>

61
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.993
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

62
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.370
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to diagnose someone for depression,</v>

63
00:01:57.371 --> 00:01:58.450
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you ask them is,</v>

64
00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.081
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

65
00:01:59.081 --> 00:02:00.850
<v Speaker 1>is your sleep chopped up?</v>

66
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.241
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

67
00:02:01.241 --> 00:02:04.330
<v Speaker 1>do you wake up multiple times at night and when you wake up,</v>

68
00:02:04.331 --> 00:02:05.500
<v Speaker 1>what happens if they say,</v>

69
00:02:05.501 --> 00:02:08.410
<v Speaker 1>well you know I have worries running through my head and I can't stop them.</v>

70
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.930
<v Speaker 1>That's rumination cause it's,</v>

71
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.440
<v Speaker 1>it's an automatic process.</v>

72
00:02:11.441 --> 00:02:12.730
<v Speaker 1>It's an unconscious process.</v>

73
00:02:12.731 --> 00:02:17.020
<v Speaker 1>Then you know that the balance between positive and negative emotion has shifted</v>

74
00:02:17.021 --> 00:02:18.250
<v Speaker 1>too far for that person.</v>

75
00:02:18.251 --> 00:02:22.450
<v Speaker 1>There's so much chaos and pain in their life or their,</v>

76
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.010
<v Speaker 1>their emotional systems have become dysregulated that it's starting to pop up</v>

77
00:02:27.011 --> 00:02:28.660
<v Speaker 1>into consciousness and dominated.</v>

78
00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.250
<v Speaker 1>So now the Yin Yang symbol is interesting for a variety of other reasons too</v>

79
00:02:33.251 --> 00:02:38.251
<v Speaker 1>because the dow is believed that that symbol represents being now being is not</v>

80
00:02:40.151 --> 00:02:45.151
<v Speaker 1>the same thing as objective reality being is what you experience has a conscious</v>

81
00:02:45.161 --> 00:02:50.140
<v Speaker 1>creature that's being and for the Dow is being is made up of these two elements,</v>

82
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.490
<v Speaker 1>order in chaos.</v>

83
00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:52.720
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that,</v>

84
00:02:52.721 --> 00:02:53.710
<v Speaker 1>it's quite straight forward.</v>

85
00:02:53.711 --> 00:02:58.000
<v Speaker 1>The reason for that is wherever you go and whenever you live and whoever you</v>

86
00:02:58.001 --> 00:02:58.834
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

87
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.700
<v Speaker 1>each environment that you're in is composed of things you understand and things</v>

88
00:03:03.701 --> 00:03:07.630
<v Speaker 1>that work the way you expect them to and things you do not understand.</v>

89
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:08.680
<v Speaker 1>And that can be,</v>

90
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.020
<v Speaker 1>that can pull the rug out from you at any moment.</v>

91
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.220
<v Speaker 1>And so you can say in some sense that these symbolic representations are</v>

92
00:03:15.221 --> 00:03:19.330
<v Speaker 1>representations of the most unchanging elements of Ba.</v>

93
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.460
<v Speaker 1>So the most real things,</v>

94
00:03:21.461 --> 00:03:22.111
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

95
00:03:22.111 --> 00:03:24.160
<v Speaker 1>a typical modern person look at this and think,</v>

96
00:03:24.161 --> 00:03:25.060
<v Speaker 1>well those aren't real.</v>

97
00:03:25.061 --> 00:03:26.590
<v Speaker 1>It's like they are real.</v>

98
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.071
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

99
00:03:27.071 --> 00:03:28.120
<v Speaker 1>they're hyper real.</v>

100
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.950
<v Speaker 1>Because one of the things that defines real is that it's permanent and it is</v>

101
00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:33.431
<v Speaker 1>permanent.</v>

102
00:03:33.431 --> 00:03:34.270
<v Speaker 1>No matter where you go,</v>

103
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:36.010
<v Speaker 1>there are things you know and things you don't know.</v>

104
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.330
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't matter who you are,</v>

105
00:03:37.331 --> 00:03:38.164
<v Speaker 1>it's permanent.</v>

106
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.070
<v Speaker 1>So it's part of the existential landscape of human being.</v>

107
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:43.570
<v Speaker 1>Now the other thing that's,</v>

108
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.750
<v Speaker 1>there's two other things that are quite cool about the Yin Yang symbol in one is</v>

109
00:03:46.751 --> 00:03:48.010
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>

110
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.010
<v Speaker 1>each of the black pacey has little white.in it.</v>

111
00:03:51.011 --> 00:03:52.780
<v Speaker 1>And the White Paisley has a little black.in it.</v>

112
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.130
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is the Taoists also recognized quite well that chaos</v>

113
00:03:57.131 --> 00:03:58.780
<v Speaker 1>could turn to order at any moment.</v>

114
00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.291
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

115
00:03:59.291 --> 00:04:02.700
<v Speaker 1>so a new order can arise out of a chaotic structure that's like a,</v>

116
00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.630
<v Speaker 1>that's a revolution in some sense.</v>

117
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.430
<v Speaker 1>But by the same token,</v>

118
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.860
<v Speaker 1>if you're in a place that's orderly and predictable,</v>

119
00:04:08.861 --> 00:04:12.310
<v Speaker 1>something can happen that casts you into a chaotic situation right away.</v>

120
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.660
<v Speaker 1>So there's a dynamic,</v>

121
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.820
<v Speaker 1>even though these two things oppose each other,</v>

122
00:04:15.821 --> 00:04:16.654
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>

123
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.330
<v Speaker 1>there's a continual dynamic interplay between them.</v>

124
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.660
<v Speaker 1>And then the final thing that's quite interesting about this symbol,</v>

125
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.780
<v Speaker 1>this is mindbogglingly brilliant idea,</v>

126
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.910
<v Speaker 1>is that cause the dao also means that the way and the way is the line between</v>

127
00:04:30.911 --> 00:04:31.744
<v Speaker 1>the two.</v>

128
00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.150
<v Speaker 1>And so what that indicates is,</v>

129
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.470
<v Speaker 1>this is a brilliant idea,</v>

130
00:04:35.471 --> 00:04:40.471
<v Speaker 1>is that the optimal position for a human being isn't in chaos or in order.</v>

131
00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:43.210
<v Speaker 1>Because if it's too much order,</v>

132
00:04:43.211 --> 00:04:44.440
<v Speaker 1>then it's totalitarian.</v>

133
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.120
<v Speaker 1>And if it's too much chaos than it's disgust and fear and emotional pain and</v>

134
00:04:49.121 --> 00:04:49.954
<v Speaker 1>depression.</v>

135
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:55.140
<v Speaker 1>So where's the proper place and the Dallas answers right on the line where you</v>

136
00:04:55.601 --> 00:04:59.440
<v Speaker 1>have one foot in order so that you're fairly stable and you'll have another foot</v>

137
00:04:59.441 --> 00:05:00.071
<v Speaker 1>in chaos.</v>

138
00:05:00.071 --> 00:05:04.090
<v Speaker 1>So that new and interesting and compelling and transforming things are happening</v>

139
00:05:04.091 --> 00:05:04.720
<v Speaker 1>to you.</v>

140
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.720
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that you might note is that your nervous system basically</v>

141
00:05:09.761 --> 00:05:14.530
<v Speaker 1>tells you when you're there and the way it tells you is by making you interested</v>

142
00:05:14.531 --> 00:05:16.300
<v Speaker 1>in whatever it is that you're engaged in.</v>

143
00:05:16.301 --> 00:05:20.410
<v Speaker 1>Because the fact that the thing that you're engaged in grips you,</v>

144
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.990
<v Speaker 1>which is really an unconscious process,</v>

145
00:05:22.991 --> 00:05:24.400
<v Speaker 1>you can't really control that.</v>

146
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.980
<v Speaker 1>It's something that happens to you is because your nervous system,</v>

147
00:05:26.981 --> 00:05:31.900
<v Speaker 1>which is actually adapted to the environment of chaos and order is telling you</v>

148
00:05:31.901 --> 00:05:34.060
<v Speaker 1>that if you're engaged in interested,</v>

149
00:05:34.061 --> 00:05:38.080
<v Speaker 1>you are at in the place where the balance between chaos and order is,</v>

150
00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:39.163
<v Speaker 1>is perfect.</v>

151
00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:40.450
<v Speaker 1>Now you think about that,</v>

152
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.100
<v Speaker 1>it's no use reading a paper that you cannot understand at all.</v>

153
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.400
<v Speaker 1>Even though hypothetically that would be a tremendously informative paper,</v>

154
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:49.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

155
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.090
<v Speaker 1>But you can't understand it because it's all chaos to you.</v>

156
00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.540
<v Speaker 1>And then there's absolutely no reason reading a paper,</v>

157
00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.680
<v Speaker 1>the tense time.</v>

158
00:05:56.681 --> 00:05:59.600
<v Speaker 1>If you've extracted the information out of it,</v>

159
00:05:59.601 --> 00:06:00.770
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be boring.</v>

160
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:01.491
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

161
00:06:01.491 --> 00:06:02.330
<v Speaker 1>so what do you want?</v>

162
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.941
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

163
00:06:02.941 --> 00:06:05.360
<v Speaker 1>you want a paper that you can almost understand.</v>

164
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:06.470
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>

165
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:06.831
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

166
00:06:06.831 --> 00:06:07.041
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

167
00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:08.300
<v Speaker 1>you're the frameworks,</v>

168
00:06:08.301 --> 00:06:12.830
<v Speaker 1>the cognitive frameworks that you have at hand are sufficient for you to take</v>

169
00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:14.570
<v Speaker 1>the next step into the unknown.</v>

170
00:06:14.571 --> 00:06:15.620
<v Speaker 1>And the paper will,</v>

171
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.120
<v Speaker 1>will inform you of that.</v>

172
00:06:17.121 --> 00:06:18.560
<v Speaker 1>And so those are the sorts of things.</v>

173
00:06:18.561 --> 00:06:19.311
<v Speaker 1>Books do that.</v>

174
00:06:19.311 --> 00:06:24.110
<v Speaker 1>Movies do that conversations do that even lines of thought to that if they're</v>

175
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.860
<v Speaker 1>exactly at the right level of complexity for you,</v>

176
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.300
<v Speaker 1>they're going to engage you.</v>

177
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.220
<v Speaker 1>And people know this man.</v>

178
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:31.971
<v Speaker 1>They know it.</v>

179
00:06:31.971 --> 00:06:33.200
<v Speaker 1>So here's an example.</v>
