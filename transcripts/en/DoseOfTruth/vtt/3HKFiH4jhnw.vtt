1
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.050
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really hoping you can share your</v>

2
00:00:10.051 --> 00:00:11.310
<v Speaker 1>thoughts on the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just shooting.</v>

3
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4
00:00:15.961 --> 00:00:20.110
<v Speaker 1>what I would do is recommend the</v>
<v Speaker 1>biblical lecture I did on Cain and Abel,</v>

5
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.370
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think that that's a good</v>

6
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.290
<v Speaker 1>summary of the state of mind that</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody has to be in in order to do</v>

7
00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:32.070
<v Speaker 1>what was done at Los Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to be very,</v>

8
00:00:32.071 --> 00:00:35.970
<v Speaker 1>very embittered by life in order to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing.</v>

9
00:00:35.971 --> 00:00:38.820
<v Speaker 1>And you have to be searching for</v>
<v Speaker 1>revenge,</v>

10
00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:40.470
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not,</v>

11
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>

12
00:00:41.431 --> 00:00:43.710
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's only revenge on other people</v>

13
00:00:43.711 --> 00:00:45.780
<v Speaker 1>because you've developed hatred for</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

14
00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:48.960
<v Speaker 1>but it's deeper than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just hatred for people.</v>

15
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.570
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's hatred for being itself</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

16
00:00:52.571 --> 00:00:57.270
<v Speaker 1>and the desire to take revenge on being</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the outrage of the tragedy and</v>

17
00:00:57.271 --> 00:01:00.140
<v Speaker 1>suffering that's associated with being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

18
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.960
<v Speaker 1>and maybe the tragedy and suffering</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's being part and parcel of your own</v>

19
00:01:03.961 --> 00:01:04.670
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

20
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.980
<v Speaker 1>And that makes you embittered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then past embittered becomes</v>

21
00:01:07.981 --> 00:01:12.300
<v Speaker 1>outraged and past outrage becomes well</v>
<v Speaker 1>homicidal or even genocidal.</v>

22
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.480
<v Speaker 1>And that's a terrible state of mind to</v>
<v Speaker 1>begin.</v>

23
00:01:15.481 --> 00:01:17.670
<v Speaker 1>It's a hellish state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

24
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.100
<v Speaker 1>I believe that the best way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize the state of mind that</v>

25
00:01:23.101 --> 00:01:26.310
<v Speaker 1>someone has to be at in order to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like the Columbine shootings</v>

26
00:01:26.311 --> 00:01:28.830
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or what happened in Las Vegas is that</v>

27
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.020
<v Speaker 1>you're really an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you have to speak about it and</v>

28
00:01:31.021 --> 00:01:33.540
<v Speaker 1>religious languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're really out for revenge against</v>

29
00:01:33.541 --> 00:01:35.460
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the outrage of creation.</v>

30
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.960
<v Speaker 1>That's what it looks like to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a state of mind that's truly</v>

31
00:01:39.961 --> 00:01:42.720
<v Speaker 1>hellish and you could get there by</v>
<v Speaker 1>broody long enough.</v>

32
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.200
<v Speaker 1>Now it's also possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this guy didn't have any previous</v>

33
00:01:46.201 --> 00:01:48.510
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>criminal history or anything like that</v>

34
00:01:48.511 --> 00:01:50.160
<v Speaker 1>and he's pretty old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

35
00:01:50.161 --> 00:01:55.020
<v Speaker 1>there's also also also the possibility</v>
<v Speaker 1>of some kind of neurological pathology</v>

36
00:01:55.021 --> 00:01:57.600
<v Speaker 1>that that might be characteristic of</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

37
00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.180
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some degenerative neurological disease.</v>

38
00:02:00.181 --> 00:02:04.290
<v Speaker 1>There was a kid years ago at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>University of Texas at Austin who</v>

39
00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:08.070
<v Speaker 1>climbed up on the tower there and shot a</v>
<v Speaker 1>number of people with a high powered</v>

40
00:02:08.071 --> 00:02:13.071
<v Speaker 1>rifle and he had a fast growing tumor on</v>
<v Speaker 1>his hypothalamus and had reported like</v>

41
00:02:13.351 --> 00:02:16.950
<v Speaker 1>these being overcome with extreme</v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings of rage.</v>

42
00:02:16.951 --> 00:02:21.951
<v Speaker 1>And so that's another possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would say the,</v>

43
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>embitterment hypothesis is the strongest</v>

44
00:02:25.831 --> 00:02:27.600
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would also say too,</v>

45
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.510
<v Speaker 1>I noticed the Steven Pinker tweeted this</v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

46
00:02:30.511 --> 00:02:34.020
<v Speaker 1>is that one of the ways of controlling</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of thing would be for the</v>

47
00:02:34.021 --> 00:02:37.650
<v Speaker 1>press to agree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not for there to be a blanket agreement,</v>

48
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.680
<v Speaker 1>not to publicize the name or any other</v>
<v Speaker 1>identity markers of the people who do</v>

49
00:02:42.781 --> 00:02:46.290
<v Speaker 1>the shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there's also this really,</v>

50
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.630
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arrogance.</v>

51
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.990
<v Speaker 1>It's a kind of arrogance and pride last</v>
<v Speaker 1>ditch,</v>

52
00:02:51.991 --> 00:02:56.910
<v Speaker 1>arrogance and pride that that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with the fantasies that drive</v>

53
00:02:56.911 --> 00:02:57.930
<v Speaker 1>this sort of behavior.</v>

54
00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.430
<v Speaker 1>And the fantasy is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

55
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.340
<v Speaker 1>after I do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone will sure know the who,</v>

56
00:03:03.341 --> 00:03:04.960
<v Speaker 1>who the hell I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

57
00:03:04.961 --> 00:03:08.710
<v Speaker 1>even though maybe I was ignored or</v>
<v Speaker 1>unhappy when I was alive after I'm dead,</v>

58
00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:12.010
<v Speaker 1>everybody's going to know who I was and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what idea did you know?</v>

59
00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:15.130
<v Speaker 1>So there's this underground desire for</v>
<v Speaker 1>fame,</v>

60
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.030
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's notoriety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but notoriety might be preferable to</v>

61
00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:20.890
<v Speaker 1>being ignored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

62
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of talk about gun control</v>

63
00:03:23.231 --> 00:03:25.990
<v Speaker 1>and that's understandable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially with regards to automatic</v>

64
00:03:25.991 --> 00:03:27.390
<v Speaker 1>rifles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

65
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.920
<v Speaker 1>although I also understand why the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are gun owners are afraid of,</v>

66
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.090
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

67
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowing what they regard as one of</v>

68
00:03:36.851 --> 00:03:39.010
<v Speaker 1>their fundamental rights to be infringed</v>
<v Speaker 1>upon.</v>

69
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.650
<v Speaker 1>But it would certainly be useful if we</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop giving people who do this sort of</v>

70
00:03:44.651 --> 00:03:47.440
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not $100 million worth of free publicity</v>

71
00:03:47.441 --> 00:03:50.170
<v Speaker 1>and all the notoriety they can manage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

72
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's another way of thinking about</v>

73
00:03:51.911 --> 00:03:53.530
<v Speaker 1>controlling it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

74
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.950
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

75
00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.430
<v Speaker 3>one of the things you'll see if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

76
00:03:57.431 --> 00:03:58.890
<v Speaker 3>if you're interested in this sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

77
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.750
<v Speaker 3>if you ever go read the writings of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the Columbine killers that the teens,</v>

78
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.900
<v Speaker 3>they're very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're very much worth reading,</v>

79
00:04:06.901 --> 00:04:10.020
<v Speaker 3>especially I think it's Dylan Klebold</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was the more literate of the,</v>

80
00:04:10.021 --> 00:04:12.850
<v Speaker 3>of the two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he tells you exactly where he went</v>

81
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.410
<v Speaker 3>after brooding and brooding and brooding</v>
<v Speaker 3>on his,</v>

82
00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.680
<v Speaker 3>his isolation and segregation from</v>
<v Speaker 3>mankind.</v>

83
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.790
<v Speaker 3>So he's out there beyond,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's out there in a chaotic domain and</v>

84
00:04:23.791 --> 00:04:27.090
<v Speaker 3>because he's tortured by that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his thoughts taken unbelievably dark</v>

85
00:04:27.091 --> 00:04:29.550
<v Speaker 3>turn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's unimaginably dark.</v>

86
00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.740
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're interested in that sort of</v>

87
00:04:31.741 --> 00:04:32.580
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could read that.</v>

88
00:04:32.581 --> 00:04:34.860
<v Speaker 3>There's another book you could read</v>
<v Speaker 3>called Pans,</v>

89
00:04:34.861 --> 00:04:35.730
<v Speaker 3>Ram,</v>
<v Speaker 3>p,</v>

90
00:04:35.731 --> 00:04:36.271
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>N,</v>

91
00:04:36.271 --> 00:04:37.200
<v Speaker 3>zed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>r,</v>

92
00:04:37.201 --> 00:04:37.950
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>m.</v>

93
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.280
<v Speaker 3>And it's a fascinating book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about this guy who I think he raped</v>

94
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.190
<v Speaker 3>1200 men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that sort of tells you what sort of</v>

95
00:04:44.191 --> 00:04:48.840
<v Speaker 3>guy he was extraordinarily physically</v>
<v Speaker 3>powerful and brutal and malevolent.</v>

96
00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.800
<v Speaker 3>And he was kind of a juvenile delinquent</v>
<v Speaker 3>type and they put them in a reform</v>

97
00:04:52.801 --> 00:04:55.860
<v Speaker 3>school and he was not well treated it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now in reform school,</v>

98
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.920
<v Speaker 3>it's sorta like the worst of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Canadian residential schools.</v>

99
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.160
<v Speaker 3>And when he came out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was not a happy boy.</v>

100
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.720
<v Speaker 3>And so he spent the rest of his life</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to be as destructive as he could</v>

101
00:05:06.721 --> 00:05:11.310
<v Speaker 3>possibly imagine and purely consciously</v>
<v Speaker 3>with malevolent intent.</v>

102
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.120
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

103
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.120
<v Speaker 3>and believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was pretty destructive.</v>

104
00:05:15.121 --> 00:05:17.880
<v Speaker 3>He kept track of the dollar value of all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the buildings he burned down.</v>

105
00:05:17.881 --> 00:05:20.550
<v Speaker 3>He tried to start a war between Britain</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the United States.</v>

106
00:05:20.551 --> 00:05:23.300
<v Speaker 3>Like he was an all out for all out may</v>
<v Speaker 3>ham,</v>

107
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.860
<v Speaker 3>his dying words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are going to hang him.</v>

108
00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.620
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he told the guy who was going to hang</v>

109
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:29.610
<v Speaker 3>them too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

110
00:05:29.611 --> 00:05:33.060
<v Speaker 3>hurry up you who's your bastard?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could kill 12 man in the time it takes</v>

111
00:05:33.061 --> 00:05:33.894
<v Speaker 3>you to hang me.</v>

112
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.330
<v Speaker 3>And that's exactly the sort of person he</v>
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>

113
00:05:36.331 --> 00:05:39.420
<v Speaker 3>And he made friends with this physician</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

114
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.290
<v Speaker 3>in the prison who he thought was like</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first person who ever did something</v>

115
00:05:43.291 --> 00:05:45.630
<v Speaker 3>nice for them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gave them a dollar for cigarettes if I</v>

116
00:05:45.631 --> 00:05:48.090
<v Speaker 3>remember correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the physician encouraged him to</v>

117
00:05:48.091 --> 00:05:50.310
<v Speaker 3>write his autobiography.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we did.</v>

118
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.910
<v Speaker 3>And it's available.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if you want a view,</v>

119
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.370
<v Speaker 3>because you know you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you always think of people,</v>

120
00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:58.760
<v Speaker 3>you think well people have good</v>
<v Speaker 3>intentions,</v>

121
00:05:58.761 --> 00:06:01.970
<v Speaker 3>you know that you specially things out</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're naive and agreeable.</v>

122
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.210
<v Speaker 3>So all of you who are sitting there out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there thinking people have good</v>

123
00:06:05.211 --> 00:06:07.490
<v Speaker 3>intentions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're probably high in agreeableness,</v>

124
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:12.910
<v Speaker 3>but that's not always the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People can have very dark motivations</v>

125
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.210
<v Speaker 3>that are fully conscious and very well</v>
<v Speaker 3>elaborated and pans around was no,</v>

126
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:22.280
<v Speaker 3>he was smart and his book is very well</v>
<v Speaker 3>written and he tells you exactly why he</v>

127
00:06:22.281 --> 00:06:23.420
<v Speaker 3>thought the way he thought.</v>

128
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.590
<v Speaker 3>And so it's a good glimpse of exactly</v>
<v Speaker 3>this sort of thing where you can get to</v>

129
00:06:27.591 --> 00:06:30.650
<v Speaker 3>if you want to buy brooding on your</v>
<v Speaker 3>specific misfortune.</v>

130
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.843
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in his,</v>

131
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.300
<v Speaker 3>his basic credo was that human beings</v>
<v Speaker 3>were so reprehensible that they should</v>

132
00:06:35.301 --> 00:06:38.540
<v Speaker 3>just be eliminated and believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what he was trying to do.</v>

133
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.380
<v Speaker 3>And these people who do terrible things</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the Columbine shooters,</v>

134
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.990
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for lack of a better word,</v>

135
00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:47.570
<v Speaker 3>they're possessed by it's sheer</v>
<v Speaker 3>malevolence.</v>

136
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.160
<v Speaker 3>And the Columbine kids had a much more</v>
<v Speaker 3>spectacular catastrophe plan than the</v>

137
00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:55.130
<v Speaker 3>one that actually occur.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they knew it was going to be a full</v>

138
00:06:55.131 --> 00:06:58.350
<v Speaker 3>blown media circus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And lots of these people who engage in</v>

139
00:06:58.351 --> 00:07:02.180
<v Speaker 3>these sorts of mass murders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they know about the other mass murderers</v>

140
00:07:02.181 --> 00:07:05.450
<v Speaker 3>and they're engaged in a competition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the competition is who can do the</v>

141
00:07:05.451 --> 00:07:07.820
<v Speaker 3>most brutal thing the fastest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

142
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:10.780
<v Speaker 3>So you can't just be thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who've,</v>

143
00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who have good intentions,</v>

144
00:07:13.341 --> 00:07:16.760
<v Speaker 3>but if somehow gone wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you ever meet someone who isn't like</v>

145
00:07:16.761 --> 00:07:20.960
<v Speaker 3>that and you think that you're just a</v>
<v Speaker 3>tree with ripe fruit to be plucked.</v>
