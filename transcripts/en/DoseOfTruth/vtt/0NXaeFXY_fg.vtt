1
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:12.050
<v Speaker 1>I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know what to do</v>

2
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.490
<v Speaker 1>stupid things that you're doing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good start because it starts to</v>

3
00:00:19.531 --> 00:00:21.410
<v Speaker 1>clear your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you,</v>

4
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.580
<v Speaker 1>if you don't know what to do but you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>know that you're doing things that maybe</v>

5
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.620
<v Speaker 1>regret,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could start by just eliminating it</v>

6
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.240
<v Speaker 1>slowly to the basket of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>started to become ethical rules.</v>

7
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.690
<v Speaker 1>Seven ethical rules with any live</v>
<v Speaker 1>long enough,</v>

8
00:00:45.691 --> 00:00:49.440
<v Speaker 1>then you'll get this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have a clear vision and then you</v>

9
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.500
<v Speaker 1>might be received the way forward more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might see a way forward for more</v>

10
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.620
<v Speaker 1>intensity rather than merely what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>should avoid.</v>

11
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.680
<v Speaker 1>So that's a good initial practical issue</v>
<v Speaker 1>is because everyone knows perfectly well</v>

12
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.500
<v Speaker 1>that there were things you were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you shouldn't do it,</v>

13
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.570
<v Speaker 1>but you don't stop.</v>

14
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.270
<v Speaker 1>Start stopping</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's part of this idea about</v>

15
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.750
<v Speaker 1>putting your house in perfect order</v>
<v Speaker 1>before you criticize the world because</v>

16
00:01:21.751 --> 00:01:24.960
<v Speaker 1>there's a question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always open and that was the</v>

17
00:01:24.961 --> 00:01:25.980
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

18
00:01:25.981 --> 00:01:28.890
<v Speaker 1>that God placed in front of me is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

19
00:01:28.891 --> 00:01:30.650
<v Speaker 1>how do you get on the road?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would be a terrible place.</v>

20
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.380
<v Speaker 1>He weren't such a wretched thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it wouldn't be.</v>

21
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:36.531
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

22
00:01:36.531 --> 00:01:38.670
<v Speaker 1>that's very casual answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you say?</v>

23
00:01:38.671 --> 00:01:42.060
<v Speaker 1>The people who has a parent who's dying</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Alzheimer's disease for example,</v>

24
00:01:42.061 --> 00:01:44.820
<v Speaker 1>it's like whether they're going to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>their act together and fix that.</v>

25
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.730
<v Speaker 1>It's like it would make it a hell of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot better than it would be.</v>

26
00:01:47.731 --> 00:01:49.380
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you that,</v>

27
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.590
<v Speaker 1>and that's something because it's nice</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have someone who's dead and your</v>

28
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.540
<v Speaker 1>family without having a credit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>unnecessary pathology.</v>

29
00:01:57.541 --> 00:02:01.230
<v Speaker 1>Gather around that and make something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that could be nearly tragic into</v>

30
00:02:01.231 --> 00:02:06.231
<v Speaker 1>something that sounds right and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens to people all the time and so</v>

31
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.480
<v Speaker 1>even if it's not a perfect solution is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best solution that you have and then</v>

32
00:02:12.481 --> 00:02:17.100
<v Speaker 1>the next part that is when I suggest to</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that they do the future authoring</v>

33
00:02:17.101 --> 00:02:18.650
<v Speaker 1>program and they're.</v>

34
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.900
<v Speaker 1>They're leery about doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked them to do that because a bad</v>

35
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.260
<v Speaker 1>headline is way better than no plan</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you implemented that plan,</v>

36
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.280
<v Speaker 1>then you learn why that plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

37
00:02:35.281 --> 00:02:38.850
<v Speaker 1>Not Hypothetically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but exactly in the world and then in the</v>

38
00:02:38.851 --> 00:02:42.860
<v Speaker 1>news that information above your failure</v>
<v Speaker 1>to retool.</v>

39
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.950
<v Speaker 1>A better plan and so to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>manage,</v>

40
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.840
<v Speaker 1>if you're tracking a destination that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving,</v>

41
00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.030
<v Speaker 1>it's some kind of ideal you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your vision is blurry,</v>

42
00:02:52.031 --> 00:02:55.110
<v Speaker 1>you don't know where to look and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to go this way and then you</v>

43
00:02:55.111 --> 00:02:58.200
<v Speaker 1>can go this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you keep doing that,</v>

44
00:02:58.201 --> 00:03:03.201
<v Speaker 1>then the deviations from the right path</v>
<v Speaker 1>to decrease with time and eventually</v>

45
00:03:03.311 --> 00:03:07.090
<v Speaker 1>you'll be walking forward in an</v>
<v Speaker 1>efficient manner and you might have to</v>

46
00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:09.700
<v Speaker 1>be all sorts of errors before you</v>
<v Speaker 1>managed that,</v>

47
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.970
<v Speaker 1>but I've watched people long enough in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my clinical practice to know that</v>

48
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.960
<v Speaker 1>waiting for Godot was a very bad idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not employee.</v>

49
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.140
<v Speaker 1>That is a very bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like implementing the best plan to</v>

50
00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.150
<v Speaker 1>have a camp</v>
<v Speaker 1>and learn from her and that works and</v>

51
00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:30.040
<v Speaker 1>you get sharper at making your planners</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the other thing that we do in</v>

52
00:03:30.041 --> 00:03:31.470
<v Speaker 1>the future authoring program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the school,</v>

53
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.560
<v Speaker 1>we asked people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe you can decide what your</v>

54
00:03:35.561 --> 00:03:39.690
<v Speaker 1>passion for your calling you should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a pretty global question,</v>

55
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.140
<v Speaker 1>but you might ask yourself some</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions like,</v>

56
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.920
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there something you could do to</v>

57
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.020
<v Speaker 1>improve your interpretation ship?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing,</v>

58
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:53.380
<v Speaker 1>is there a way that you can improve your</v>
<v Speaker 1>friendships?</v>

59
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.160
<v Speaker 1>Is there something you can do at your</v>
<v Speaker 1>job that will make it better than it is</v>

60
00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.670
<v Speaker 1>now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if it's something you preventable?</v>

61
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.150
<v Speaker 1>Could you do something more productive</v>
<v Speaker 1>and meaningful with your time outside of</v>

62
00:04:04.151 --> 00:04:07.210
<v Speaker 1>work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could you be slightly better handling</v>

63
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.530
<v Speaker 1>temptations that come your way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could you take care of yourself?</v>

64
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.980
<v Speaker 1>Something like better mentally and</v>
<v Speaker 1>physically and you know the answer is</v>

65
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.020
<v Speaker 1>all of those questions is Jennifer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

66
00:04:17.021 --> 00:04:21.520
<v Speaker 1>and then you can even ask yourself a</v>
<v Speaker 1>simpler question which would be,</v>

67
00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.160
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there is something that you could do</v>

68
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.760
<v Speaker 1>that would make one of those things</v>
<v Speaker 1>married,</v>

69
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.930
<v Speaker 1>is there also something that you would</v>
<v Speaker 1>do and you can ask yourself that you</v>

70
00:04:31.971 --> 00:04:34.210
<v Speaker 1>know instead of telling themselves that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should,</v>

71
00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.940
<v Speaker 1>which isn't the same thing might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

72
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.330
<v Speaker 1>I would like my marriage to be better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can ask yourself,</v>

73
00:04:40.331 --> 00:04:41.680
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can my marriage be better?</v>

74
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.970
<v Speaker 1>And you'll get a bunch of answers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of them you will,</v>

75
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.620
<v Speaker 1>because if you really ask myself a</v>
<v Speaker 1>question like that,</v>

76
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.100
<v Speaker 1>the part of their brain that's imagined</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's looking for new answers will</v>

77
00:04:51.101 --> 00:04:54.490
<v Speaker 1>tell you and it looks like a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things you don't want to hear at.</v>

78
00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.790
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them will be things you already</v>
<v Speaker 1>know and some of them will be things</v>

79
00:04:57.791 --> 00:05:00.910
<v Speaker 1>that there's just no damn way they'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>give you know that you should,</v>

80
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.290
<v Speaker 1>but some subset of those might be things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you should do that by your own</v>

81
00:05:05.291 --> 00:05:10.291
<v Speaker 1>definition that you actually would do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be trivial things in or hooked</v>

82
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.670
<v Speaker 1>trivial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least they're a step in the right</v>

83
00:05:12.671 --> 00:05:16.090
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So take whatever step in the right</v>

84
00:05:16.091 --> 00:05:20.440
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're willing to take day by day and</v>

85
00:05:20.441 --> 00:05:24.360
<v Speaker 1>that's incremental progress and it'll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll spiral upward.</v>

86
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.400
<v Speaker 1>It does spiral up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or there's a statement in the New</v>

87
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.720
<v Speaker 1>Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which actually happens to be a true</v>

88
00:05:28.721 --> 00:05:31.690
<v Speaker 1>statement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to those who have everything</v>

89
00:05:31.691 --> 00:05:36.691
<v Speaker 1>more will be given and it's a reflection</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind phenomena that looks like</v>

90
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.540
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon that looks like a natural</v>
<v Speaker 1>laws.</v>

91
00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.470
<v Speaker 1>As things start to accrue to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rate at which they will further</v>

92
00:05:44.471 --> 00:05:46.300
<v Speaker 1>approved will increase.</v>

93
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.810
<v Speaker 1>That's a natural logs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Price's law sometimes with the court</v>

94
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:55.100
<v Speaker 1>parade reflect greater distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's a chapter in 12 rolls,</v>

95
00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.830
<v Speaker 1>life called don't compare yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Compare yourself to who you were</v>

96
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.590
<v Speaker 1>yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to someone else's today,</v>

97
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.050
<v Speaker 1>and it's in conjunction for incremental</v>
<v Speaker 1>improvement.</v>

98
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.180
<v Speaker 1>If you don't know where to go in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

99
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.050
<v Speaker 1>think about where you are and see if</v>
<v Speaker 1>today you could make where are you,</v>

100
00:06:12.051 --> 00:06:16.370
<v Speaker 1>are somewhat better on some dimension so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that when you go to bed at night,</v>

101
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.310
<v Speaker 1>you're not as wretched as you were when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you woke up in the morning,</v>

102
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.960
<v Speaker 1>and so if you do that for two years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was one thing a day,</v>

103
00:06:23.961 --> 00:06:26.560
<v Speaker 1>just a small thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something you could actually do that you</v>

104
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.780
<v Speaker 1>would do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then your life will be waived it and at</v>

105
00:06:29.781 --> 00:06:33.230
<v Speaker 1>the end of that you might have enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>clarity of mind to start to understand</v>

106
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:36.830
<v Speaker 1>where you go if things worked out for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you properly in the world.</v>

107
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.150
<v Speaker 1>So that's the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That question.</v>

108
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.520
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

109
00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:00.280
<v Speaker 1>Here's another way that you figure out</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to act.</v>

110
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:06.510
<v Speaker 1>Let's say your child and there's a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know almost everyone,</v>

111
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.270
<v Speaker 1>so how do you handle that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will you stay in a simplified</v>

112
00:07:11.271 --> 00:07:12.910
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

113
00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.970
<v Speaker 1>You don't crawl out onto the street with</v>
<v Speaker 1>your 10 months old.</v>

114
00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:21.050
<v Speaker 1>Parents aren't allowed to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They keep you in a bounded did and they</v>

115
00:07:21.051 --> 00:07:26.051
<v Speaker 1>keep you close to them and what you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>is backed up what you know isn't very</v>

116
00:07:27.261 --> 00:07:32.060
<v Speaker 1>much most based on things in your mouth</v>
<v Speaker 1>and investigate them because that's what</v>

117
00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:37.090
<v Speaker 1>kids do at the smiling play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's a fragile space of knowledge</v>

118
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:44.800
<v Speaker 1>and it's easily when it's disrupted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you cry and not signal of disruption and</v>

119
00:07:45.891 --> 00:07:49.850
<v Speaker 1>then your parents move in with greater</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge and they fix whatever the</v>

120
00:07:49.851 --> 00:07:54.370
<v Speaker 1>problem is and what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you watched that and then you have a</v>

121
00:07:54.371 --> 00:07:55.204
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>

122
00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.370
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you don't let the rep</v>
<v Speaker 1>count because you're not sophisticated</v>

123
00:07:58.371 --> 00:08:01.310
<v Speaker 1>enough to know what they're up to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No child childhood give a full account</v>

124
00:08:01.311 --> 00:08:04.570
<v Speaker 1>with the behavior of their parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know parents will give a full account of</v>

125
00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:07.000
<v Speaker 1>her own beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you certainly can't expect that from</v>

126
00:08:07.001 --> 00:08:09.800
<v Speaker 1>a child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but children are obviously grow up to</v>

127
00:08:09.801 --> 00:08:13.950
<v Speaker 1>take care of their own children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like image to take care of their</v>

128
00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:16.880
<v Speaker 1>own offspring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never knowing what they're doing.</v>

129
00:08:16.881 --> 00:08:18.890
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you learned about your invitation.</v>

130
00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:24.940
<v Speaker 1>Now what that means is that collectively</v>
<v Speaker 1>we faced things that we didn't</v>

131
00:08:26.151 --> 00:08:29.530
<v Speaker 1>understand for very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very long period of time and we've</v>

132
00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:32.810
<v Speaker 1>figured out how to act so that it works</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

133
00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:36.000
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know the rules that underlie</v>

134
00:08:36.001 --> 00:08:38.300
<v Speaker 1>that exotic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know exactly what that means.</v>

135
00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:42.410
<v Speaker 1>We just figured it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's A.</v>

136
00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:44.180
<v Speaker 1>There's a way of being a good father.</v>

137
00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:48.770
<v Speaker 1>Let's say there's a way of being a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>mother and mostly you understand what</v>

138
00:08:48.771 --> 00:08:52.220
<v Speaker 1>that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you fail or when your child accuses</v>

139
00:08:52.221 --> 00:08:53.710
<v Speaker 1>you of failing gap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

140
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:56.820
<v Speaker 1>Because it's only in the failure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you realized that you deviate for</v>

141
00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:58.610
<v Speaker 1>whatever the ideal is because you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>

142
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.220
<v Speaker 1>Who the hell knows what the rules are</v>
<v Speaker 1>for being a good father?</v>

143
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:05.730
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to detail though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know when you've failed.</v>

144
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:08.430
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know how to be a control and you</v>

145
00:09:08.431 --> 00:09:11.250
<v Speaker 1>know that because you invitation to your</v>
<v Speaker 1>father,</v>

146
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:16.280
<v Speaker 1>he and his father and his father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like way back as far as you can</v>

147
00:09:16.651 --> 00:09:18.670
<v Speaker 1>possibly go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the goal.</v>

148
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:20.200
<v Speaker 1>We also know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's.</v>

149
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:24.630
<v Speaker 1>Here's an example of why having a clock</v>
<v Speaker 1>call colleague at the University of</v>

150
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:28.500
<v Speaker 1>Toronto who spends in maternal behavior</v>
<v Speaker 1>in rats raptured actually very</v>

151
00:09:28.501 --> 00:09:30.760
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have somewhat of a culture</v>

152
00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:33.600
<v Speaker 1>statement pass on through imitative</v>
<v Speaker 1>learning.</v>

153
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:35.680
<v Speaker 1>If you take away from.</v>
