00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:11.261
<v Speaker 1>Ethan's,</v>

2
00:00:11.261 --> 00:00:11.811
<v Speaker 1>the Gal says,</v>

3
00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:13.130
<v Speaker 1>how do you boost your confidence?</v>

4
00:00:13.131 --> 00:00:16.550
<v Speaker 1>Talking to people and get rid of the paranoid that people hate you and don't say</v>

5
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.170
<v Speaker 1>like you and think you're trash.</v>

6
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:19.370
<v Speaker 1>That's how I feel.</v>

7
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:19.851
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

8
00:00:19.851 --> 00:00:21.020
<v Speaker 1>well the first thing is,</v>

9
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:22.483
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

10
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.123
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

11
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.870
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you a little bit about courage.</v>

12
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:30.921
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

13
00:00:30.921 --> 00:00:32.000
<v Speaker 1>a little bit about trust.</v>

14
00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:32.834
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

15
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.970
<v Speaker 1>When you're a naive person,</v>

16
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.130
<v Speaker 1>you trust people because you think that people are good and then maybe someone</v>

17
00:00:40.131 --> 00:00:41.440
<v Speaker 1>comes along and hurts you and you think,</v>

18
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.840
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

19
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:42.531
<v Speaker 1>people aren't good.</v>

20
00:00:42.531 --> 00:00:43.610
<v Speaker 1>I can't trust anyone.</v>

21
00:00:43.611 --> 00:00:44.970
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe you're paranoid.</v>

22
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.700
<v Speaker 1>You think that people hate you and don't like you and think your trash and so</v>

23
00:00:49.701 --> 00:00:50.031
<v Speaker 1>forth.</v>

24
00:00:50.031 --> 00:00:50.990
<v Speaker 1>You don't trust people.</v>

25
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.100
<v Speaker 1>But then you figure out,</v>

26
00:00:52.101 --> 00:00:52.551
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

27
00:00:52.551 --> 00:00:55.790
<v Speaker 1>this whole not trusting people isn't working out very well because now I can't</v>

28
00:00:55.791 --> 00:00:56.451
<v Speaker 1>get anywhere.</v>

29
00:00:56.451 --> 00:00:56.630
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

30
00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.050
<v Speaker 1>and if I ever do meet someone who's trustworthy and I don't trust them,</v>

31
00:01:00.051 --> 00:01:02.630
<v Speaker 1>then they're not going to get an opportunity to show me that they're</v>

32
00:01:02.631 --> 00:01:03.231
<v Speaker 1>trustworthy.</v>

33
00:01:03.231 --> 00:01:08.231
<v Speaker 1>And so then what happens is that you replace naive trust with courageous trust,</v>

34
00:01:08.481 --> 00:01:12.110
<v Speaker 1>and you put yourself out there despite the fact that people might hate you and</v>

35
00:01:12.111 --> 00:01:13.940
<v Speaker 1>don't like you and think you're trash.</v>

36
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:15.350
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

37
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.183
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

38
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.940
<v Speaker 1>the other thing I would say that's more practical,</v>

39
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.720
<v Speaker 1>Ethan,</v>

40
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.830
<v Speaker 1>I think you'd find that you only think that when you run away,</v>

41
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.130
<v Speaker 1>my suspicions are if you went out and talked to people,</v>

42
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.190
<v Speaker 1>like you'd have to have something to talk about,</v>

43
00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:31.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.560
<v Speaker 1>but if you went out and talked to people,</v>

45
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.930
<v Speaker 1>you'd find that those thoughts only bothered you for about 10 to 15 minutes and</v>

46
00:01:38.931 --> 00:01:39.980
<v Speaker 1>then you would get over them.</v>

47
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.761
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

48
00:01:40.761 --> 00:01:43.730
<v Speaker 1>a lot of that's a high neuroticism.</v>

49
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:44.230
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

50
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:45.010
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

51
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

52
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.320
<v Speaker 1>that in the big five aspect scale,</v>

53
00:01:48.321 --> 00:01:49.490
<v Speaker 1>that's withdrawal.</v>

54
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.060
<v Speaker 1>You're experiencing a lot of withdrawal related negative emotions,</v>

55
00:01:53.061 --> 00:01:54.560
<v Speaker 1>anticipatory anxiety.</v>

56
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.470
<v Speaker 1>And the best way to overcome that is to not avoid.</v>

57
00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.200
<v Speaker 1>So if you find yourself avoiding social situations,</v>

58
00:02:00.201 --> 00:02:02.900
<v Speaker 1>then you have to formulate a plan to stop doing that.</v>

59
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.510
<v Speaker 1>And then over time your confidence will be boosted.</v>
