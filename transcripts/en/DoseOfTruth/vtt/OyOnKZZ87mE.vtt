1
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.390
<v Speaker 1>Sample an individual that it takes your</v>
<v Speaker 1>program and authors his or her future</v>

2
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.830
<v Speaker 1>already has taken the first steps off</v>
<v Speaker 1>response,</v>

3
00:00:17.831 --> 00:00:20.470
<v Speaker 1>personal responsibility by doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>something about it.</v>

4
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.830
<v Speaker 1>So let's assume that we hear we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we assume responsibility for our lives.</v>

5
00:00:25.961 --> 00:00:29.680
<v Speaker 1>We get our act together and we start</v>
<v Speaker 1>with our rooms and we,</v>

6
00:00:29.681 --> 00:00:32.170
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we broadened the circle and we want to</v>

7
00:00:32.171 --> 00:00:37.171
<v Speaker 1>start helping people out in the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>that don't have this first seed of</v>

8
00:00:38.051 --> 00:00:40.180
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

9
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.800
<v Speaker 1>and of course some of them also have</v>
<v Speaker 1>diseases they can't do anything about.</v>

10
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.850
<v Speaker 1>We can leave that aside</v>
<v Speaker 1>for now,</v>

11
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.750
<v Speaker 1>but what do we do to inspire others?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

12
00:00:52.751 --> 00:00:55.750
<v Speaker 1>you just laid it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's like,</v>

13
00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that you,</v>

14
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.900
<v Speaker 1>you pull out of the clinical literature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you have children who have a</v>

15
00:01:05.531 --> 00:01:09.820
<v Speaker 1>certain low level amount of neurological</v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble when they're infants.</v>

16
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.330
<v Speaker 1>So something's gone wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a little oxygen deprivation at</v>

17
00:01:13.331 --> 00:01:15.820
<v Speaker 1>birth or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something's going a little bit wrong</v>

18
00:01:15.821 --> 00:01:20.290
<v Speaker 1>with their neurological development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Assuming that the damage isn't too</v>

19
00:01:20.291 --> 00:01:24.580
<v Speaker 1>severe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those children will stabilize and</v>

20
00:01:24.581 --> 00:01:29.581
<v Speaker 1>normalize if they have at least one well</v>
<v Speaker 1>put together role model in their life.</v>

21
00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.290
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that you do if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to inspire others is get your</v>

22
00:01:38.021 --> 00:01:43.021
<v Speaker 1>act together because you inspire most</v>
<v Speaker 1>through example.</v>

23
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.020
<v Speaker 1>It's more much more powerful than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than words.</v>

24
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.320
<v Speaker 1>Words are very powerful if they're also</v>
<v Speaker 1>accompanied by example,</v>

25
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.800
<v Speaker 1>but the best thing you can do is start</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting things together around you.</v>

26
00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.640
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty of things to put</v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

27
00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.710
<v Speaker 1>It's a good meditative exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

28
00:01:59.711 --> 00:02:02.890
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is the proper form of</v>

29
00:02:02.891 --> 00:02:04.000
<v Speaker 1>prayer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

30
00:02:04.001 --> 00:02:09.001
<v Speaker 1>assuming that there is such a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm proper form of prayer would be if</v>

31
00:02:09.161 --> 00:02:11.650
<v Speaker 1>you're not happy with your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're miserable,</v>

32
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.380
<v Speaker 1>you sit on the edge of your bed and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

33
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.160
<v Speaker 1>is there anything I can change in what</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing that is going to make this</v>

34
00:02:20.161 --> 00:02:23.550
<v Speaker 1>less awful than it has to be less awful</v>
<v Speaker 1>than it might be?</v>

35
00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.160
<v Speaker 1>You have to ask that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.220
<v Speaker 1>with intent and generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll get an answer almost immediately.</v>

37
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.450
<v Speaker 1>There's something that you could put</v>
<v Speaker 1>right that day that would make things</v>

38
00:02:39.451 --> 00:02:41.970
<v Speaker 1>slightly better than they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's rule four,</v>

39
00:02:41.971 --> 00:02:46.400
<v Speaker 1>which is compare yourself to who you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet to who you were yesterday and not to</v>

40
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.530
<v Speaker 1>who someone else's today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There,</v>

41
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that there's a person</v>
<v Speaker 1>who exists who wouldn't receive an</v>

42
00:02:53.611 --> 00:02:55.830
<v Speaker 1>answer to that question if they</v>
<v Speaker 1>genuinely asked it.</v>

43
00:02:55.831 --> 00:02:58.770
<v Speaker 1>And it's no different really than</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking like if you,</v>

44
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.410
<v Speaker 1>you have a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think you get an answer might not be</v>

45
00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:04.930
<v Speaker 1>the right answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but obviously you get an answer and you</v>

46
00:03:04.931 --> 00:03:05.471
<v Speaker 1>might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

47
00:03:05.471 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 1>I thought up that answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

48
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.790
<v Speaker 1>well that's really not much of an</v>
<v Speaker 1>explanation because you don't know how</v>

49
00:03:09.791 --> 00:03:12.220
<v Speaker 1>you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm sitting there and thoughts</v>

50
00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:15.430
<v Speaker 1>appear in my head and that's how I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like that's a pretty shallow</v>

51
00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:18.580
<v Speaker 1>explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not much different than revelation.</v>

52
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.890
<v Speaker 1>It's like you ask yourself the proper</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions,</v>

53
00:03:20.891 --> 00:03:25.720
<v Speaker 1>you'll get the proper answers if you ask</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right question and you want the</v>

54
00:03:25.721 --> 00:03:29.500
<v Speaker 1>answers right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those are not easy preconditions to</v>

55
00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:31.750
<v Speaker 1>set up because who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

56
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:33.820
<v Speaker 1>if you're sitting on the edge of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>bed thinking,</v>

57
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.063
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

58
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.870
<v Speaker 1>what am I doing wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a hell of a question to ask.</v>

59
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.240
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you really want to know,</v>

60
00:03:43.241 --> 00:03:46.630
<v Speaker 1>you'll find out and then you'll find out</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you really didn't want to know.</v>

61
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.290
<v Speaker 1>Because generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finding out what you're doing wrong is</v>

62
00:03:50.291 --> 00:03:54.520
<v Speaker 1>not a pleasant experience and it means</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have to sacrifice part of</v>

63
00:03:54.521 --> 00:03:56.380
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually a burned out,</v>

64
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.450
<v Speaker 1>stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitter,</v>

65
00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:59.710
<v Speaker 1>corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrogant,</v>

66
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.890
<v Speaker 1>nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vengeful part of yourself,</v>

67
00:04:02.891 --> 00:04:06.280
<v Speaker 1>but nonetheless part that you like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

68
00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.140
<v Speaker 1>so you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that room for those incremental</v>

69
00:04:12.141 --> 00:04:14.900
<v Speaker 1>improvements exists within everyone's</v>
<v Speaker 1>grasp.</v>

70
00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.520
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that it's a humble thing to</v>

71
00:04:19.521 --> 00:04:22.400
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to ask how you could improve</v>

72
00:04:22.401 --> 00:04:25.460
<v Speaker 1>incrementally without interfering with</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone else.</v>

73
00:04:25.461 --> 00:04:27.200
<v Speaker 1>Like it's your problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not theirs.</v>

74
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.650
<v Speaker 1>But I think that the consequences of</v>
<v Speaker 1>maintained incremental improvement are</v>

75
00:04:33.351 --> 00:04:38.351
<v Speaker 1>anything but incremental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get compound interest on incremental</v>

76
00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:40.040
<v Speaker 1>improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

77
00:04:40.041 --> 00:04:43.070
<v Speaker 1>there's another rule in the New</v>
<v Speaker 1>Testament called the Matthew principle.</v>

78
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.210
<v Speaker 1>It's economists use it and the rule is</v>
<v Speaker 1>to those who have everything more will</v>

79
00:04:47.211 --> 00:04:49.190
<v Speaker 1>be given.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And from those who have nothing,</v>

80
00:04:49.191 --> 00:04:52.610
<v Speaker 1>everything will be taken to an actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>a description of the way the world</v>

81
00:04:52.611 --> 00:04:54.050
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly enough,</v>

82
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.090
<v Speaker 1>you know that if you've ever played</v>
<v Speaker 1>monopoly,</v>

83
00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.980
<v Speaker 1>because that's what happens if you play</v>
<v Speaker 1>monopoly.</v>

84
00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.890
<v Speaker 1>And there's a reason for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a deep reason.</v>

85
00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.130
<v Speaker 1>But what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a very harsh rule because it</v>

86
00:05:04.131 --> 00:05:07.760
<v Speaker 1>means as you start to wander off the</v>
<v Speaker 1>path,</v>

87
00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.670
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you will wonder</v>

88
00:05:10.671 --> 00:05:15.671
<v Speaker 1>further off the path increases</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonlinearly and that's a terrible thing</v>

89
00:05:15.921 --> 00:05:16.670
<v Speaker 1>to know.</v>

90
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.060
<v Speaker 1>As you wonder towards the edge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you'll fall off the</v>

91
00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.360
<v Speaker 1>cliff increases and that's a statistical</v>
<v Speaker 1>justification for the concept of hell.</v>

92
00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.450
<v Speaker 1>But as you improve the probability that</v>
<v Speaker 1>each improvement will produce a further</v>

93
00:05:32.451 --> 00:05:35.750
<v Speaker 1>improvement increases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so perhaps the,</v>

94
00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:41.150
<v Speaker 1>the downside is the cataclysmic</v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe that you can engage upon if</v>

95
00:05:41.151 --> 00:05:46.151
<v Speaker 1>you reproduce your moral failings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the upside is that each improvement</v>

96
00:05:46.461 --> 00:05:50.090
<v Speaker 1>produces an increment in the probability</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the next improvement.</v>

97
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.160
<v Speaker 1>And I've seen that it's a truism among</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavioral psychologists.</v>

98
00:05:54.161 --> 00:05:56.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although they don't generally phrase it</v>

99
00:05:56.091 --> 00:05:58.790
<v Speaker 1>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a behavioral psychologist and</v>

100
00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:02.810
<v Speaker 1>I am a behavioral psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do is you find out what</v>

101
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:08.720
<v Speaker 1>essentially you help a person establish</v>
<v Speaker 1>their aim and then you break down what</v>

102
00:06:08.721 --> 00:06:12.770
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to do into attainable</v>
<v Speaker 1>units and you negotiate with them.</v>

103
00:06:12.771 --> 00:06:13.521
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>

104
00:06:13.521 --> 00:06:14.354
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

105
00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:15.453
<v Speaker 1>well I'm not me.</v>

106
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.480
<v Speaker 1>They say I'm not making use of my time</v>
<v Speaker 1>very well.</v>

107
00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:19.850
<v Speaker 1>Spending three hours a day playing video</v>
<v Speaker 1>games.</v>

108
00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:22.010
<v Speaker 1>And you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

109
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.490
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically,</v>

110
00:06:25.491 --> 00:06:27.980
<v Speaker 1>how much time would you like to spend</v>
<v Speaker 1>playing video games?</v>

111
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.540
<v Speaker 1>And they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

112
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:34.040
<v Speaker 1>I could probably spend an hour a day</v>
<v Speaker 1>without it interfering with the rest of</v>

113
00:06:34.041 --> 00:06:35.750
<v Speaker 1>my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of the issue,</v>

114
00:06:35.751 --> 00:06:37.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you play video games,</v>

115
00:06:37.431 --> 00:06:39.710
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe three hours means that you're</v>

116
00:06:39.711 --> 00:06:42.590
<v Speaker 1>not doing your homework or something and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a good game.</v>

117
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:43.701
<v Speaker 1>So you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

118
00:06:43.701 --> 00:06:45.890
<v Speaker 1>well I want to play for an hour a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

119
00:06:45.891 --> 00:06:47.660
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well can you shift to an hour a day</v>

120
00:06:47.661 --> 00:06:49.880
<v Speaker 1>right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is supposed to be an honest</v>

121
00:06:49.881 --> 00:06:51.620
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the person says,</v>

122
00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.660
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've tried that lots of times.</v>

123
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.460
<v Speaker 1>Every time I try,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just fail.</v>

124
00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:57.020
<v Speaker 1>And so you don't say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

125
00:06:57.021 --> 00:06:57.740
<v Speaker 1>quit failing.</v>

126
00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:01.520
<v Speaker 1>Go play one hour a day and the problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>will be solved.</v>

127
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.160
<v Speaker 1>That's a stupid strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

128
00:07:04.161 --> 00:07:05.240
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>

129
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:10.280
<v Speaker 1>you think about this and don't agree to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do this unless you think you will do it</v>

130
00:07:10.281 --> 00:07:12.380
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise it's just a waste of</v>
<v Speaker 1>both of our times.</v>

131
00:07:12.381 --> 00:07:15.140
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think that you could track how</v>

132
00:07:15.141 --> 00:07:18.200
<v Speaker 1>much time you've spent playing video</v>
<v Speaker 1>games for one week?</v>

133
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.760
<v Speaker 1>Don't change anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just track it and they think,</v>

134
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:25.220
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could probably do that,</v>

135
00:07:25.221 --> 00:07:26.990
<v Speaker 1>but I might miss a couple of days and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

136
00:07:26.991 --> 00:07:28.640
<v Speaker 1>okay fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here's the deal.</v>

137
00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.270
<v Speaker 1>Five out of the next seven days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just track how much time you spend</v>

138
00:07:32.271 --> 00:07:35.000
<v Speaker 1>playing video games and the person says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I can do that,</v>

139
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.680
<v Speaker 1>because that's what you want them to</v>
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>

140
00:07:36.681 --> 00:07:40.430
<v Speaker 1>You want them to succeed at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The improvement is not much of an</v>

141
00:07:40.431 --> 00:07:41.720
<v Speaker 1>improvement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's something,</v>

142
00:07:41.721 --> 00:07:42.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

143
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:43.700
<v Speaker 1>Then they come back and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

144
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:45.710
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was playing about four hours a day,</v>

145
00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.480
<v Speaker 1>and so you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

146
00:07:47.481 --> 00:07:49.490
<v Speaker 1>well fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good work man.</v>

147
00:07:49.491 --> 00:07:51.110
<v Speaker 1>You've got to track.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we know what,</v>

148
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.560
<v Speaker 1>we know the parameters of your problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually a little worse than you</v>

149
00:07:54.561 --> 00:07:56.870
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least he had enough sense to</v>

150
00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.020
<v Speaker 1>measure it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know where you're at.</v>

151
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:04.280
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think you could cut that down to</v>

152
00:08:04.281 --> 00:08:07.550
<v Speaker 1>three and a half hours every day and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>person thinks,</v>

153
00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:11.330
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty weak willed.</v>

154
00:08:11.331 --> 00:08:14.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I could manage that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

155
00:08:14.331 --> 00:08:15.081
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how about this?</v>

156
00:08:15.081 --> 00:08:19.970
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that two of the next seven</v>
<v Speaker 1>days you can only play for three hours?</v>

157
00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.130
<v Speaker 1>You think you can manage that and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

158
00:08:22.131 --> 00:08:24.800
<v Speaker 1>You're not cynical about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not insulting the person,</v>

159
00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.380
<v Speaker 1>any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like because you don't care,</v>

160
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.670
<v Speaker 1>all you care is that they make some</v>
<v Speaker 1>incremental movement towards their goal</v>

161
00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:33.410
<v Speaker 1>and the person thinks about that.</v>

162
00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:36.920
<v Speaker 1>If they have any sense and they take</v>
<v Speaker 1>their weakness into account and they</v>

163
00:08:36.921 --> 00:08:39.350
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I could probably do that.</v>

164
00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:41.990
<v Speaker 1>And then they come back the next week</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they say,</v>

165
00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:47.620
<v Speaker 1>I managed to spend three hours a day</v>
<v Speaker 1>playing video games for three days and</v>

166
00:08:48.681 --> 00:08:50.330
<v Speaker 1>the rest were four hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you say,</v>

167
00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.620
<v Speaker 1>good work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

168
00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:56.800
<v Speaker 1>you've just got rid of 25%</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 and a half percent of your problem.</v>

169
00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:03.330
<v Speaker 1>You're one eighth of the way to fixing</v>
<v Speaker 1>it in one week.</v>

170
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:07.110
<v Speaker 1>And you know the person isn't going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be all that thrilled with themselves</v>

171
00:09:07.111 --> 00:09:09.000
<v Speaker 1>because they don't do the arithmetic</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do.</v>

172
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:10.740
<v Speaker 1>And they don't do that projection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think,</v>

173
00:09:10.741 --> 00:09:12.330
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still pretty damn useless.</v>

174
00:09:12.331 --> 00:09:16.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm playing 25 hours worth of video</v>
<v Speaker 1>games a week.</v>

175
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:18.570
<v Speaker 1>It's nothing to pat myself on the back</v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

176
00:09:18.571 --> 00:09:19.740
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes it is.</v>

177
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:24.930
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a market measurable improvement and</v>

178
00:09:24.931 --> 00:09:26.970
<v Speaker 1>it's a move in the right direction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

179
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:27.781
<v Speaker 1>And then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

180
00:09:27.781 --> 00:09:32.160
<v Speaker 1>well on the days you succeeded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did you manage to succeed?</v>

181
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:36.420
<v Speaker 1>And is there a way that you could do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>for four days next week?</v>

182
00:09:36.421 --> 00:09:37.980
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or or come,</v>

183
00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:41.220
<v Speaker 1>maybe you could even try five days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think you could do that?</v>

184
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.410
<v Speaker 1>And then you also tell the person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

185
00:09:43.411 --> 00:09:46.050
<v Speaker 1>the other thing you've got to understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>is you're not going to improve like</v>

186
00:09:46.051 --> 00:09:48.840
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna improve like this.</v>

187
00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.300
<v Speaker 1>So some weeks you're going to come back</v>
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>

188
00:09:51.301 --> 00:09:52.890
<v Speaker 1>Geez,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I backslid completely.</v>

189
00:09:52.891 --> 00:09:55.410
<v Speaker 1>And I like played for four hours a day</v>
<v Speaker 1>for seven days,</v>

190
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:58.350
<v Speaker 1>but doesn't matter because that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean you failed.</v>

191
00:09:58.351 --> 00:10:02.610
<v Speaker 1>It just means that you slid back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to calculate it over a month or</v>

192
00:10:02.611 --> 00:10:04.080
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

193
00:10:04.081 --> 00:10:06.870
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a month later the person's down to</v>

194
00:10:06.871 --> 00:10:11.640
<v Speaker 1>something like two hours a day and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've figured out a ways of filling</v>

195
00:10:11.641 --> 00:10:13.830
<v Speaker 1>their time in with something productive</v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise,</v>

196
00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:15.240
<v Speaker 1>and they're on their way.</v>

197
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:20.040
<v Speaker 1>And the general consequence of that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that every time they manage an</v>

198
00:10:20.041 --> 00:10:23.010
<v Speaker 1>accomplishment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get a little stronger in character.</v>

199
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.550
<v Speaker 1>They get a little bit more confident in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their ability to get a little bit less</v>

200
00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:30.180
<v Speaker 1>wracked with self disgust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get a little bit more hopeful about</v>

201
00:10:30.181 --> 00:10:34.170
<v Speaker 1>the future and they get more confident</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they can make another change.</v>

202
00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.770
<v Speaker 1>And if you're patient and you have to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>patient with yourself that way,</v>

203
00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:41.250
<v Speaker 1>it's like you reward those incremental</v>
<v Speaker 1>improvements and you don't get all</v>

204
00:10:41.251 --> 00:10:43.440
<v Speaker 1>cynical about them and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

205
00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:47.280
<v Speaker 1>just imagine what would happen if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>kept doing that every week for 10 years.</v>

206
00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:51.570
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is things would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be so much better for you that you can't</v>

207
00:10:51.571 --> 00:10:53.820
<v Speaker 1>even imagine it with that much</v>
<v Speaker 1>improvement,</v>

208
00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:56.220
<v Speaker 1>or maybe even with half that much</v>
<v Speaker 1>improvement.</v>

209
00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:59.970
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very good way of progressing.</v>

210
00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:02.850
<v Speaker 1>So very good.</v>
