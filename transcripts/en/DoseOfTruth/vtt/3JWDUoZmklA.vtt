1
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you delve into the literature on</v>

2
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:10.960
<v Speaker 1>Judaism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity and Islam and their</v>

3
00:00:10.961 --> 00:00:14.590
<v Speaker 1>versions of the afterlife and heaven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're quite different in the Jews are</v>

4
00:00:14.591 --> 00:00:17.860
<v Speaker 1>far less obsessed with going some place</v>
<v Speaker 1>after death.</v>

5
00:00:17.861 --> 00:00:19.390
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>originally they had.</v>

6
00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.290
<v Speaker 1>They were going no place at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shell was just nothing.</v>

7
00:00:23.291 --> 00:00:25.510
<v Speaker 1>It was just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He returned to where you were before.</v>

8
00:00:25.511 --> 00:00:27.880
<v Speaker 1>You're allowed just no place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9
00:00:27.881 --> 00:00:29.650
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that,</v>

10
00:00:29.651 --> 00:00:32.180
<v Speaker 1>that religion is far more focused on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>here and now.</v>

11
00:00:32.181 --> 00:00:34.500
<v Speaker 1>Like we have a moral duty to help</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

12
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.580
<v Speaker 1>the poor and so on now and to live</v>
<v Speaker 1>better lives and more lives of dignity</v>

13
00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:44.581
<v Speaker 1>and honor and let now and at</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity really started off more</v>

14
00:00:44.801 --> 00:00:47.260
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then kind of morphed over the centuries</v>

15
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.460
<v Speaker 1>and it particularly in fundamentalist</v>
<v Speaker 1>and evangelicals in the 20th century</v>

16
00:00:51.461 --> 00:00:55.020
<v Speaker 1>toward this place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to go right now.</v>

17
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You kind of had the schism in</v>

18
00:00:57.311 --> 00:01:00.310
<v Speaker 1>Christianity today between the kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

19
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.990
<v Speaker 1>the fundamentalists that are constantly</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about the afterlife and</v>

20
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.480
<v Speaker 1>accepting Jesus and they're focused on</v>
<v Speaker 1>missionary,</v>

21
00:01:07.481 --> 00:01:11.230
<v Speaker 1>working into birding people versus say</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the Rick Warren's of the world</v>

22
00:01:11.231 --> 00:01:15.520
<v Speaker 1>that want to put their money into a soup</v>
<v Speaker 1>kitchens and helping the poor and,</v>

23
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.251
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

24
00:01:16.251 --> 00:01:21.251
<v Speaker 1>and Christians have a moral duty to help</v>
<v Speaker 1>those in need and not so much focused on</v>

25
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.010
<v Speaker 1>the next life.</v>

26
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.883
<v Speaker 1>And yeah,</v>

27
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.610
<v Speaker 2>it's funny because there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are real dangers associated with</v>

28
00:01:28.611 --> 00:01:33.500
<v Speaker 2>both those kinds of conceptualizations</v>
<v Speaker 2>mean you alluded to one danger that was</v>

29
00:01:33.501 --> 00:01:36.320
<v Speaker 2>associated with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's call those who are concerned more</v>

30
00:01:36.321 --> 00:01:40.550
<v Speaker 2>with the immediate present.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the starting to manifest</v>

31
00:01:40.551 --> 00:01:42.050
<v Speaker 2>itself in these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in these,</v>

32
00:01:42.051 --> 00:01:45.440
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>technological immortalists.</v>

33
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.790
<v Speaker 2>They're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

34
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.960
<v Speaker 2>we should transform the nature of being</v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily radically right here and</v>

35
00:01:50.961 --> 00:01:53.150
<v Speaker 2>now so that we have heaven in</v>
<v Speaker 2>immortality here.</v>

36
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:54.111
<v Speaker 2>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

37
00:01:54.111 --> 00:01:55.940
<v Speaker 2>what do we lose by doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

38
00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.440
<v Speaker 2>that's the question that's really worth</v>
<v Speaker 2>asking because if we're transhuman then</v>

39
00:02:00.441 --> 00:02:03.380
<v Speaker 2>we lose being human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it may be that we actually don't</v>

40
00:02:03.381 --> 00:02:06.440
<v Speaker 2>want to lose being human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though being human means suffering</v>

41
00:02:06.441 --> 00:02:08.000
<v Speaker 2>and malevolent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>

42
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.060
<v Speaker 2>it's a very hard question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then the Christians,</v>

43
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.240
<v Speaker 2>this is what we need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She went after the Christian.</v>

44
00:02:13.241 --> 00:02:14.900
<v Speaker 2>Since it's such an ax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

45
00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:19.250
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you despise the current world and you</v>

46
00:02:19.251 --> 00:02:21.950
<v Speaker 2>leave everything to be rectified in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>afterlife,</v>

47
00:02:21.951 --> 00:02:25.190
<v Speaker 2>then you just abandoned life itself and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're really trainers to life.</v>

48
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.250
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to steer through those to shoot two</v>

49
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.170
<v Speaker 2>shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say is thing or to cliff's.</v>

50
00:02:33.171 --> 00:02:34.850
<v Speaker 2>That's a very difficult proposition.</v>

51
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:36.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the message.</v>

52
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.180
<v Speaker 1>My message in the book to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the military eons and the cryonics</v>

53
00:02:41.181 --> 00:02:45.740
<v Speaker 1>and transhumanism and so on is I'm glad</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're working on this problem.</v>

54
00:02:45.741 --> 00:02:47.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because I say to Schermer don't you</v>

55
00:02:47.701 --> 00:02:51.320
<v Speaker 1>want to live to be a thousand years and</v>
<v Speaker 1>my response is look,</v>

56
00:02:51.321 --> 00:02:56.321
<v Speaker 1>just get me the 90 without cancer and</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 without Alzheimer's and 110 without</v>

57
00:02:56.931 --> 00:02:58.910
<v Speaker 1>being plugged into machines and lying in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a.</v>

58
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.120
<v Speaker 1>because that's not alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

59
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.130
<v Speaker 1>so I'm glad people are working on like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the best diet,</v>

60
00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.480
<v Speaker 1>how much?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What can we do to improve our memory?</v>

61
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:11.291
<v Speaker 1>And so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all.</v>

62
00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:15.780
<v Speaker 1>Great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm glad and I'm glad Kurzweil is</v>

63
00:03:15.781 --> 00:03:19.390
<v Speaker 1>now the chief engineer of all Google.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's got some resources to do</v>

64
00:03:19.391 --> 00:03:23.050
<v Speaker 1>something about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that this focus on living a thousand</v>

65
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.840
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your first one you may miss the little</v>

66
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.080
<v Speaker 1>incremental things we can do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also you're missing out now.</v>

67
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.550
<v Speaker 1>There's this fell in my right about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the book I'm on Ray Kurzweil.</v>

68
00:03:33.551 --> 00:03:35.650
<v Speaker 1>It's a little kind of biographical film</v>
<v Speaker 1>of him,</v>

69
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.850
<v Speaker 1>a transcendent man and he's constantly</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>

70
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>living forever and so on and he's</v>

71
00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:45.820
<v Speaker 1>obsessed with his father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His father died when he was 51.</v>

72
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.650
<v Speaker 1>The father was 51 and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and ray was kind of missed out having a</v>

73
00:03:50.651 --> 00:03:54.740
<v Speaker 1>father figure because the father was</v>
<v Speaker 1>always working and ray was a,</v>

74
00:03:54.741 --> 00:03:55.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

75
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.300
<v Speaker 1>a real entrepreneur achiever from his</v>
<v Speaker 1>teenage years.</v>

76
00:03:58.301 --> 00:04:02.290
<v Speaker 1>So he was always working and the film</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of follows him around collecting</v>

77
00:04:02.291 --> 00:04:05.110
<v Speaker 1>everything he can about his father and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he keeps it in the basement of his house</v>

78
00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:08.350
<v Speaker 1>and he wants to resurrect his father and</v>
<v Speaker 1>a computer and it's like,</v>

79
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.741
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy.</v>

80
00:04:08.741 --> 00:04:12.130
<v Speaker 1>Freud would have a field day with this</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indian guy,</v>

81
00:04:12.131 --> 00:04:14.050
<v Speaker 1>but there's something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something going on there.</v>

82
00:04:14.051 --> 00:04:15.700
<v Speaker 1>This sort of rose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

83
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.410
<v Speaker 2>I see this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this strange dichotomy and attitude that</v>

84
00:04:20.411 --> 00:04:23.920
<v Speaker 2>you just described.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even characterizing use that in my own</v>

85
00:04:23.921 --> 00:04:28.750
<v Speaker 2>life because I'm very interested in</v>
<v Speaker 2>technologies that stave off aging,</v>

86
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.590
<v Speaker 2>dietary manipulations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I have this machine in my basement</v>

87
00:04:32.591 --> 00:04:36.700
<v Speaker 2>that's intense pulse light,</v>
<v Speaker 2>late intense pulse light machine that's</v>

88
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.510
<v Speaker 2>unbelievable skin rejuvenator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an absolute miracle.</v>

89
00:04:40.511 --> 00:04:43.360
<v Speaker 2>This machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it'll take,</v>

90
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.450
<v Speaker 2>it'll take sun damage from your skin</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely.</v>

91
00:04:46.451 --> 00:04:48.940
<v Speaker 2>And forced rejuvenation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

92
00:04:48.941 --> 00:04:51.460
<v Speaker 2>it's just like using photoshop on your</v>
<v Speaker 2>skin.</v>

93
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.200
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

94
00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.780
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

95
00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.030
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I think,</v>

96
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.670
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it interesting to do everything</v>

97
00:04:57.671 --> 00:05:02.080
<v Speaker 2>possible to prolong youth in life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at the same time there's another</v>

98
00:05:02.081 --> 00:05:05.110
<v Speaker 2>part of me that's thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

99
00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.300
<v Speaker 2>this is something I wrote about it in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this new book that I'm publishing.</v>

100
00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm just thinking about socrates and his</v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to accept his death.</v>

101
00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.340
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what socrates seems to have revealed</v>

102
00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.450
<v Speaker 2>in his acceptance of his death was that</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you live your life properly,</v>

103
00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:24.130
<v Speaker 2>then you may be.</v>

104
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.090
<v Speaker 2>You lived your life in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've exhausted it in some sense.</v>

105
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.230
<v Speaker 2>The question is if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you lived a thousand years,</v>

106
00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:33.670
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what exactly,</v>

107
00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.180
<v Speaker 2>what exactly would you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

108
00:05:37.181 --> 00:05:40.000
<v Speaker 2>like I've had kids and I loved having</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids,</v>

109
00:05:40.001 --> 00:05:42.640
<v Speaker 2>but I wouldn't have them again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I wouldn't do that again,</v>

110
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I have a grandchild and that's fine,</v>

111
00:05:45.521 --> 00:05:49.750
<v Speaker 2>but that's a new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I've had a career and I as I get</v>

112
00:05:49.751 --> 00:05:53.080
<v Speaker 2>older,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea of having 10 more careers</v>

113
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:57.170
<v Speaker 2>seems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like I'm not interested in it,</v>

114
00:05:57.171 --> 00:06:01.640
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't grip me the same way that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would have say 20 years ago.</v>

115
00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:07.230
<v Speaker 2>And so I wonder like I wonder if it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the case that life is in some sense</v>

116
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.050
