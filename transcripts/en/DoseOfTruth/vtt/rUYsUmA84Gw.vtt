00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.310
<v Speaker 1>So what if we said hypothetically something like this.</v>

2
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.200
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that morality isn't a philosophy.</v>

3
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:15.910
<v Speaker 1>It's not something explicit,</v>

4
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.170
<v Speaker 1>something implicit.</v>

5
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:18.610
<v Speaker 1>How does it evolve?</v>

6
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:19.503
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

7
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.670
<v Speaker 1>emotional creatures produce it.</v>

8
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.480
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to produce it in isolation if you were weren't a social animal.</v>

9
00:00:25.481 --> 00:00:28.750
<v Speaker 1>If you live the solitary and nocturnal existence by yourself,</v>

10
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.960
<v Speaker 1>there's no need for morality cause you don't have to regulate your behavior with</v>

11
00:00:31.961 --> 00:00:33.250
<v Speaker 1>regards to your peers,</v>

12
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.930
<v Speaker 1>but your social animals.</v>

13
00:00:34.931 --> 00:00:36.430
<v Speaker 1>So you're stuck with everybody else.</v>

14
00:00:36.431 --> 00:00:40.420
<v Speaker 1>But everybody else could be conceived of as a grand average.</v>

15
00:00:40.421 --> 00:00:41.020
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

16
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.450
<v Speaker 1>How would you act towards the average person?</v>

17
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:44.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

18
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.550
<v Speaker 1>I would say that very,</v>

19
00:00:45.551 --> 00:00:49.540
<v Speaker 1>very stable moral systems tell you exactly that and they say things like,</v>

20
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:50.403
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.120
<v Speaker 1>do on others as you would have them do unto you.</v>

22
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.480
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

23
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.250
<v Speaker 1>Basic principle of reciprocity.</v>

24
00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.480
<v Speaker 1>Why does that work?</v>

25
00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.090
<v Speaker 1>And it's a complex precept.</v>

26
00:01:01.091 --> 00:01:04.510
<v Speaker 1>It means I should treat you like I would like to be treated by you.</v>

27
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.741
<v Speaker 1>And you might think,</v>

28
00:01:05.741 --> 00:01:07.150
<v Speaker 1>well that means to be nice to you,</v>

29
00:01:07.151 --> 00:01:09.640
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't really what it means because Nice isn't enough.</v>

30
00:01:09.641 --> 00:01:10.180
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

31
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.330
<v Speaker 1>What I want from you really is communication.</v>

32
00:01:13.331 --> 00:01:15.190
<v Speaker 1>Real communication feedback.</v>

33
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.320
<v Speaker 1>What am I doing that's acceptable and good?</v>

34
00:01:17.321 --> 00:01:19.690
<v Speaker 1>What am I doing that's unacceptable and not good?</v>

35
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.170
<v Speaker 1>And that ladder aspect of feedback as part of the reason why,</v>

36
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.210
<v Speaker 1>if you're psychopathological and isolated,</v>

37
00:01:28.211 --> 00:01:33.211
<v Speaker 1>you're in much worse shape because half of your sanity or three quarters of it,</v>

38
00:01:33.221 --> 00:01:34.240
<v Speaker 1>or 90% of it,</v>

39
00:01:34.241 --> 00:01:36.070
<v Speaker 1>who knows is distributed sanity.</v>

40
00:01:36.071 --> 00:01:39.490
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to be that sane as long as you're hanging around other people.</v>

41
00:01:39.491 --> 00:01:41.590
<v Speaker 1>Because as soon as you do something that's deviant,</v>

42
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.570
<v Speaker 1>they're going to raise an eyebrow at you,</v>

43
00:01:43.571 --> 00:01:43.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

44
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.591
<v Speaker 1>And then you think,</v>

45
00:01:44.591 --> 00:01:44.951
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

46
00:01:44.951 --> 00:01:46.280
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>

47
00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:47.080
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

48
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.760
<v Speaker 1>and as soon as you do something good,</v>

49
00:01:48.761 --> 00:01:50.890
<v Speaker 1>then they're going to pay more attention to you and smile at you.</v>

50
00:01:50.891 --> 00:01:55.840
<v Speaker 1>So all of the information about how to regulate yourself is out there in the</v>

51
00:01:55.841 --> 00:01:56.261
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

52
00:01:56.261 --> 00:01:56.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

53
00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.240
<v Speaker 1>The average person.</v>

54
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.280
<v Speaker 1>How many people do you interact with in a week?</v>

55
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.770
<v Speaker 1>300 say maybe it's not that many.</v>

56
00:02:02.771 --> 00:02:03.604
<v Speaker 1>100.</v>

57
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.060
<v Speaker 1>How about any year thousand two thousand five thousand ten thousand what are</v>

58
00:02:10.181 --> 00:02:11.380
<v Speaker 1>they all telling you?</v>

59
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:13.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

60
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.800
<v Speaker 1>the message is similar across people.</v>

61
00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:15.634
<v Speaker 1>How similar.</v>

62
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.130
<v Speaker 1>Don't know exactly how similar.</v>

63
00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:19.740
<v Speaker 1>That's what stories telling you.</v>
