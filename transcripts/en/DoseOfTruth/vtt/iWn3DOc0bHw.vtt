00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:07.330
<v Speaker 1>There's any,</v>

2
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.720
<v Speaker 1>there's another strange element to that,</v>

3
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.670
<v Speaker 1>which is that on the one hand,</v>

4
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:12.220
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

5
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:17.010
<v Speaker 1>the radical feminist types that neo Marxists postmodernists are,</v>

6
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.370
<v Speaker 1>are very much opposed to the patriarchy,</v>

7
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.001
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

8
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:21.930
<v Speaker 1>And that's that unit,</v>

9
00:00:21.931 --> 00:00:22.591
<v Speaker 1>dimensional,</v>

10
00:00:22.591 --> 00:00:23.790
<v Speaker 1>ideological represented,</v>

11
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.430
<v Speaker 2>average listed every prayer,</v>

12
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.080
<v Speaker 2>perhaps the word can be applied to Republican Rome and that's it.</v>

13
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.010
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

14
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.221
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

15
00:00:29.221 --> 00:00:32.370
<v Speaker 1>and it maybe it could be applied usefully to certain kinds of tyranny,</v>

16
00:00:32.371 --> 00:00:34.640
<v Speaker 1>but not to a society that's actually functional.</v>

17
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.430
<v Speaker 2>Victorian England and one arguably.</v>

18
00:00:37.431 --> 00:00:37.720
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

19
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.800
<v Speaker 2>But other than that,</v>

20
00:00:38.801 --> 00:00:42.750
<v Speaker 2>and to use the word patriarchy in that and that slapdash way fulfill amateur</v>

21
00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:43.290
<v Speaker 2>tourists.</v>

22
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.791
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

23
00:00:43.791 --> 00:00:44.180
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

24
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.410
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

25
00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.400
<v Speaker 2>just shows people know nothing about history,</v>

26
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.291
<v Speaker 2>whatever have you had written,</v>

27
00:00:47.291 --> 00:00:48.130
<v Speaker 2>had done no reading.</v>

28
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.771
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

29
00:00:48.771 --> 00:00:53.340
<v Speaker 1>and so what confuses me about that is that despite the fact that the Patriarchy</v>

30
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.740
<v Speaker 1>is viewed as this essentially evil entity and that that's associated with the</v>

31
00:00:57.741 --> 00:01:00.590
<v Speaker 1>masculine energy that built this oppressive structure,</v>

32
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.930
<v Speaker 1>the antithesis of that,</v>

33
00:01:02.931 --> 00:01:05.810
<v Speaker 1>which would actually be femininity as far as I can tell,</v>

34
00:01:05.811 --> 00:01:10.400
<v Speaker 1>which is tightly associated with care and with child rearing is also denigrated.</v>

35
00:01:10.401 --> 00:01:15.401
<v Speaker 1>So it's like the only proper role for women to adopt is a patriarchal role,</v>

36
00:01:15.711 --> 00:01:18.740
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that the patriarchy is something that's entirely corrupt.</v>

37
00:01:18.741 --> 00:01:23.741
<v Speaker 1>So the hypothesis seems to be that the patriarchy would be just fine if women</v>

38
00:01:23.991 --> 00:01:24.824
<v Speaker 1>ran it.</v>

39
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.270
<v Speaker 1>So no changes.</v>

40
00:01:26.271 --> 00:01:29.960
<v Speaker 1>It's just that would just be a transformation of leadership and somehow that</v>

41
00:01:29.961 --> 00:01:30.410
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>

42
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.960
<v Speaker 1>that would rectify the fundamental problem,</v>

43
00:01:32.961 --> 00:01:35.440
<v Speaker 1>even though it's hypothetically supposed to be structural.</v>
