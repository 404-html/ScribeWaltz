One idea that's very common in our culture is that poverty is caused by lack of

2
00:00:08.131 --> 00:00:08.461
money.

3
00:00:08.461 --> 00:00:13.461
And that's a really stupid idea because money is very difficult to handle.

4
00:00:13.471 --> 00:00:18.471
I had clients who were drug addicts and the worst possible thing that could

5
00:00:18.961 --> 00:00:20.850
happen to them was that they got some money.

6
00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:22.680
They're just done.

7
00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:23.191
First of all,

8
00:00:23.191 --> 00:00:23.431
you know,

9
00:00:23.431 --> 00:00:28.380
they were hanging around with people who were little on the sociopathic side.

10
00:00:28.381 --> 00:00:29.214
And so,

11
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.480
especially if they weren't that bright and couldn't defend themselves very well,

12
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.500
as soon as they got the money while it was off to the bar with all the friends

13
00:00:37.501 --> 00:00:38.490
and you know,

14
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.190
one guy I remember in particular,

15
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.491
you know,

16
00:00:41.491 --> 00:00:45.330
every time you go out as his disability check,

17
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:47.820
he was gone for five days,

18
00:00:47.821 --> 00:00:49.140
usually found them in a ditch,

19
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:49.891
you know,

20
00:00:49.891 --> 00:00:51.390
cause he just go to the bar,

21
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.320
spend every sandy had on alcohol and cocaine and wake up in a ditch,

22
00:00:58.771 --> 00:00:59.830
three quarters dead,

23
00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.810
uh,

24
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.280
eventually completely dead.

25
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.580
And you know,

26
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:09.590
then he was ashamed and horrified and repentant and he'd straighten himself out

27
00:01:10.951 --> 00:01:11.311
again.

28
00:01:11.311 --> 00:01:16.260
And then that was all well and good until as long as he was broke until the next

29
00:01:16.261 --> 00:01:18.270
check showed up and then bang the same thing.
