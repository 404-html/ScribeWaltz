1
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.970
<v Speaker 1>I am guilty of overusing the word brilliant.</v>

2
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:11.470
<v Speaker 1>It diminishes its value.</v>

3
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:12.401
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

4
00:00:12.401 --> 00:00:16.810
<v Speaker 1>if there was one person walking the earth today who is truly brilliant,</v>

5
00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.970
<v Speaker 1>it is Dr. Jordan B.</v>

6
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:19.570
<v Speaker 1>Peterson.</v>

7
00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.090
<v Speaker 1>It would not be a stretch to assume history.</v>

8
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.940
<v Speaker 1>We'll lump him in with soccer days,</v>

9
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.210
<v Speaker 1>Freud and young.</v>

10
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.110
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't yet gone down the JBP rabbit hole,</v>

11
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.880
<v Speaker 1>you may think I'm being hyperbolic,</v>

12
00:00:30.881 --> 00:00:34.720
<v Speaker 1>but I assure you everything you've heard is true.</v>

13
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.790
<v Speaker 1>He is a cultural icon,</v>

14
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.833
<v Speaker 1>a phenomenon,</v>

15
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.110
<v Speaker 1>and possibly one of the smartest people alive today.</v>

16
00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.780
<v Speaker 1>Formerly a Harvard professor,</v>

17
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.870
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Peterson is currently a clinical psychologist and professor at University</v>

18
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.640
<v Speaker 1>of Toronto and has become a celebrity in his own right,</v>

19
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.050
<v Speaker 1>which is a very,</v>

20
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:58.080
<v Speaker 1>very good thing for all of us as many in academia and the left seek to make</v>

21
00:00:58.361 --> 00:01:03.361
<v Speaker 1>victims of anyone who isn't a white CIS gendered male providing safe spaces on</v>

22
00:01:04.931 --> 00:01:09.490
<v Speaker 1>campus as so young adults never have to experience the horrors of being</v>

23
00:01:09.491 --> 00:01:10.360
<v Speaker 1>offended.</v>

24
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.490
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Peterson has been speaking about the assault on the greatest liberal value</v>

25
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.380
<v Speaker 1>of all free speech.</v>

26
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.790
<v Speaker 1>You may have learned about him a couple of years ago when he ignited controversy</v>

27
00:01:21.791 --> 00:01:26.791
<v Speaker 1>by refusing to use the long list of made up gender neutral pronouns that was put</v>

28
00:01:26.981 --> 00:01:28.180
<v Speaker 1>into Canadian law.</v>

29
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.560
<v Speaker 1>Bill see 16 while he has no objections to trans people,</v>

30
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.650
<v Speaker 1>he argued forced speech under the guise of gender identity and gender expression</v>

31
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.220
<v Speaker 1>are too broad.</v>

32
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.050
<v Speaker 1>Are the propositions of radical social constructionists and are being used to</v>

33
00:01:44.051 --> 00:01:46.240
<v Speaker 1>bully opponents into submission.</v>

34
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:47.530
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

35
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.200
<v Speaker 1>free speech is not just another value.</v>

36
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.410
<v Speaker 1>It's the foundation of Western civilization.</v>

37
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.371
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

38
00:01:54.371 --> 00:01:58.690
<v Speaker 1>you may have just learned of Jordan Peterson from his recent interview with a</v>

39
00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.280
<v Speaker 1>British third wave feminist who tried every way possible to cookie cut Peterson</v>

40
00:02:03.281 --> 00:02:04.300
<v Speaker 1>as a misogynist.</v>

41
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.390
<v Speaker 1>The channel for interview in England with British journalists.</v>

42
00:02:07.391 --> 00:02:12.391
<v Speaker 1>Kathy Newman went viral and now Dr Peterson's online videos and there are many</v>

43
00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.570
<v Speaker 1>are being binged Netflix style.</v>

44
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:17.733
<v Speaker 1>I warn you,</v>

45
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.660
<v Speaker 1>you won't be able to watch just one.</v>

46
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.820
<v Speaker 1>He just released his new book,</v>

47
00:02:21.821 --> 00:02:23.080
<v Speaker 1>12 rules for life,</v>

48
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.610
<v Speaker 1>an antidote to chaos,</v>

49
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.560
<v Speaker 1>which has rocketed to the number one or two depending upon the day on the Amazon</v>

50
00:02:29.561 --> 00:02:30.460
<v Speaker 1>bestseller list.</v>

51
00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.620
<v Speaker 1>Depends upon where that tabloid trash by.</v>

52
00:02:32.621 --> 00:02:35.530
<v Speaker 1>Michael Wolff is today along with his new book,</v>

53
00:02:35.531 --> 00:02:37.750
<v Speaker 1>it seems Jordan Peterson is ubiquitous.</v>

54
00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.790
<v Speaker 1>His name is on everyone's lips.</v>

55
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.750
<v Speaker 1>I attended an event the other night and heard his name mentioned several times</v>

56
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.120
<v Speaker 1>throughout the evening by different people.</v>

57
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.110
<v Speaker 1>I learned about Jordan Peterson sometime back watching his interviews first on</v>

58
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.970
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan's podcast and subsequently on the countless speeches and lectures he</v>

59
00:02:55.971 --> 00:02:58.430
<v Speaker 1>has given all which can be found on youtube.</v>

60
00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:59.290
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

61
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.290
<v Speaker 1>he has opened up his classes to the world for free all on line watching his</v>

62
00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:05.381
<v Speaker 1>lectures.</v>

63
00:03:05.381 --> 00:03:09.160
<v Speaker 1>You feel enlightened and amazed how he combines history,</v>

64
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.060
<v Speaker 1>psychology,</v>

65
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.870
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>

66
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.870
<v Speaker 1>sociology and philosophy into a very enjoyable and learn it experience.</v>

67
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.080
<v Speaker 1>There's so much I can say about Jordan Peterson and I don't want to sound like a</v>

68
00:03:20.081 --> 00:03:20.914
<v Speaker 1>fan boy,</v>

69
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.820
<v Speaker 1>but it is truly an honor to have him join us today.</v>

70
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.980
<v Speaker 1>Obviously I'm not the only fan.</v>

71
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.750
<v Speaker 1>As he has had over 100 million hits on Youtube.</v>

72
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.710
<v Speaker 1>We opened up questions to ricochet members and we'll be asking you a few,</v>

73
00:03:35.711 --> 00:03:37.210
<v Speaker 1>but like all good things,</v>

74
00:03:37.211 --> 00:03:38.860
<v Speaker 1>there was never enough time.</v>

75
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.330
<v Speaker 1>So if we don't get to yours,</v>

76
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.201
<v Speaker 1>apologies,</v>

77
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:44.110
<v Speaker 1>but we hope to have Dr. Peterson back on again down the road.</v>

78
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.390
<v Speaker 1>So without further ado,</v>

79
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.160
<v Speaker 1>pour yourself your favorite drink.</v>

80
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.280
<v Speaker 1>Sit back and enjoy the whiskey politics interview with Dr. Jordan B.</v>

81
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.993
<v Speaker 1>Peterson.</v>

82
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.871
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

83
00:03:55.871 --> 00:03:56.591
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Peterson,</v>

84
00:03:56.591 --> 00:03:59.170
<v Speaker 1>I want to thank you for joining us at whiskey politics on ricochet.</v>

85
00:03:59.171 --> 00:04:00.820
<v Speaker 1>It really is an honor to have you with us,</v>

86
00:04:00.821 --> 00:04:02.350
<v Speaker 1>especially how busy you are right now.</v>

87
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.520
<v Speaker 1>Now Watch me try and get an hour's worth of questions into 30 minutes.</v>

88
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.220
<v Speaker 1>You just let me know when you need to get off and we'll wrap it up.</v>

89
00:04:09.221 --> 00:04:10.054
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

90
00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.150
<v Speaker 1>sounds good.</v>

91
00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.561
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

92
00:04:11.561 --> 00:04:12.310
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

93
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.830
<v Speaker 1>So your name is everywhere right now.</v>

94
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.860
<v Speaker 1>There are those of us who've been following you for some time,</v>

95
00:04:17.861 --> 00:04:20.140
<v Speaker 1>but something happened in the past few months.</v>

96
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's the Kathy Newman interview that did it,</v>

97
00:04:23.111 --> 00:04:25.450
<v Speaker 1>but everybody is talking about Jordan Peterson.</v>

98
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:26.920
<v Speaker 1>You wrote in your book,</v>

99
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.930
<v Speaker 1>you are always surprised.</v>

100
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.790
<v Speaker 1>People respond positively to what you're saying regardless or regarding the</v>

101
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.590
<v Speaker 1>seriousness of the subjects.</v>

102
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.550
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think people in the tens of millions are drawn to your message right</v>

103
00:04:39.551 --> 00:04:39.731
<v Speaker 1>now?</v>

104
00:04:39.731 --> 00:04:40.810
<v Speaker 1>What are they hungry for?</v>

105
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.720
<v Speaker 2>I think they are hungering for,</v>

106
00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:44.803
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

107
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.670
<v Speaker 2>I think they're hungry for evidence that the idea that their lives are</v>

108
00:04:48.671 --> 00:04:51.460
<v Speaker 2>meaningful and worthwhile is actually true.</v>

109
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:53.890
<v Speaker 2>And I do think it's true,</v>

110
00:04:53.891 --> 00:04:57.340
<v Speaker 2>and I detailed that extensively in my first book,</v>

111
00:04:57.341 --> 00:04:58.091
<v Speaker 2>maps of meaning,</v>

112
00:04:58.091 --> 00:04:59.490
<v Speaker 2>which is a very difficult book,</v>

113
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.110
<v Speaker 2>but then again in 12 rules for life.</v>

114
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.980
<v Speaker 2>I think that it's reasonable to make the observation that life is very difficult</v>

115
00:05:08.111 --> 00:05:11.500
<v Speaker 2>and rife with suffering and tainted with malevolence.</v>

116
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.360
<v Speaker 2>But despite that there are in the world,</v>

117
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.150
<v Speaker 2>there are ways of being in the world that are noble and worthwhile and that</v>

118
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.740
<v Speaker 2>ameliorates suffering and,</v>

119
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.360
<v Speaker 2>and malevolence and that it's worthwhile to grow up and take your place in the</v>

120
00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:30.130
<v Speaker 2>world as a responsible citizen.</v>

121
00:05:30.131 --> 00:05:34.150
<v Speaker 2>And that the ideas of sovereign individuality that have,</v>

122
00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.460
<v Speaker 2>that underpin the west are great ideas and correct and that we shouldn't lose</v>

123
00:05:39.461 --> 00:05:40.294
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

124
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.300
<v Speaker 2>And so I think that people are,</v>

125
00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.930
<v Speaker 2>there's a whole in people's hearts the same shape as that message and so we may</v>

126
00:05:49.691 --> 00:05:50.141
<v Speaker 2>hear it.</v>

127
00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:54.130
<v Speaker 2>They feel like a part of them that they didn't know it was missing has been</v>

128
00:05:54.131 --> 00:05:58.550
<v Speaker 2>replaced and so that's what it looks like to me.</v>

129
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.140
<v Speaker 1>Now you referred a lot of,</v>

130
00:06:01.141 --> 00:06:03.880
<v Speaker 1>many of our listeners have been following you for some time and a lot of people</v>

131
00:06:03.881 --> 00:06:08.370
<v Speaker 1>that just learning about you and you're known for detailing how postmodernism is</v>

132
00:06:08.371 --> 00:06:09.990
<v Speaker 1>today's form of Marxism.</v>

133
00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.350
<v Speaker 1>Is this what you're referring to here that people have had enough of the</v>

134
00:06:13.351 --> 00:06:16.680
<v Speaker 1>postmodernist maybe cause they've taken over learning institutions?</v>

135
00:06:16.681 --> 00:06:17.940
<v Speaker 1>Our media and culture?</v>

136
00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.420
<v Speaker 2>Well that's part of it.</v>

137
00:06:19.421 --> 00:06:19.870
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

138
00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:24.870
<v Speaker 2>there's a deeper Malays do though is then we'd become unmoored from our</v>

139
00:06:25.241 --> 00:06:29.650
<v Speaker 2>traditional foundations and the foundations let's say of Judaeo Christian</v>

140
00:06:29.651 --> 00:06:30.484
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>

141
00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.040
<v Speaker 2>We don't understand them who probably never did,</v>

142
00:06:33.041 --> 00:06:35.500
<v Speaker 2>but we acted demoed anyways before,</v>

143
00:06:35.501 --> 00:06:40.501
<v Speaker 2>but we can't lose sight of that tradition without falling apart in 15 different</v>

144
00:06:41.321 --> 00:06:42.154
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>

145
00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.710
<v Speaker 2>I think the postmodern way of falling apart,</v>

146
00:06:44.711 --> 00:06:45.910
<v Speaker 2>it's just one of many,</v>

147
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.340
<v Speaker 2>but it's very toxic.</v>

148
00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:53.530
<v Speaker 2>It divides us into tribes based on our ethnicity or our gender,</v>

149
00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:55.300
<v Speaker 2>our race,</v>

150
00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.690
<v Speaker 2>and then sets us against one another as oppressive versus victim.</v>

151
00:07:00.691 --> 00:07:01.810
<v Speaker 2>And it's a very,</v>

152
00:07:01.811 --> 00:07:04.330
<v Speaker 2>very pathological and dangerous narrative.</v>

153
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:05.620
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

154
00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.990
<v Speaker 2>and I think people know that instinctively,</v>

155
00:07:07.991 --> 00:07:11.770
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to descend into tribal identities again,</v>

156
00:07:11.771 --> 00:07:13.900
<v Speaker 2>but that means we needed it.</v>

157
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:18.280
<v Speaker 2>We needed an identity that is super ordinance to the tribal.</v>

158
00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:20.530
<v Speaker 2>There has to be something above that.</v>

159
00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:26.040
<v Speaker 2>And I think the idea of the sovereign individual is the right transcendent</v>

160
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.290
<v Speaker 2>representation.</v>

161
00:07:28.291 --> 00:07:30.790
<v Speaker 2>And I think that people know that too,</v>

162
00:07:30.791 --> 00:07:31.624
<v Speaker 2>because it's,</v>

163
00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:33.880
<v Speaker 2>that message is everywhere in our culture,</v>

164
00:07:33.881 --> 00:07:36.820
<v Speaker 2>even know it's not made as explicit as it should.</v>

165
00:07:36.821 --> 00:07:38.650
<v Speaker 2>We're explicit as often as it should.</v>

166
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:39.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

167
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:41.210
<v Speaker 1>You talk about individualism,</v>

168
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:41.530
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

169
00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:46.130
<v Speaker 1>your message comes from the perspective of a classic liberal and individualism</v>

170
00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.390
<v Speaker 1>is part of that.</v>

171
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:47.950
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

172
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:50.090
<v Speaker 1>but the interesting thing,</v>

173
00:07:50.091 --> 00:07:52.070
<v Speaker 1>you've not only been a student of Marxism,</v>

174
00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:53.450
<v Speaker 1>communism and socialism,</v>

175
00:07:53.451 --> 00:07:55.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean you really went deep into it.</v>

176
00:07:55.791 --> 00:07:59.270
<v Speaker 1>Soviet gulags the rise of Nazi-ism and the Holocaust and you always refer to the</v>

177
00:07:59.271 --> 00:08:03.170
<v Speaker 1>Gulag archipelago that the machine eats itself.</v>

178
00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:06.170
<v Speaker 1>You relate today's postmodernist to that same machine.</v>

179
00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:07.311
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

180
00:08:07.311 --> 00:08:10.400
<v Speaker 2>I think they're driven by the same pathological ideology.</v>

181
00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:15.760
<v Speaker 2>You can tell that by their emphasis on the impressive versus victim narrative,</v>

182
00:08:15.921 --> 00:08:19.700
<v Speaker 2>which is classic Marxism is just give him new clothing.</v>

183
00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:20.181
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

184
00:08:20.181 --> 00:08:23.270
<v Speaker 2>it's not the bourgeoisie versus the protests.</v>

185
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:24.081
<v Speaker 2>Proletariat,</v>

186
00:08:24.081 --> 00:08:28.070
<v Speaker 2>it's the oppressed minority versus the oppressive here.</v>

187
00:08:28.071 --> 00:08:28.904
<v Speaker 2>Majority,</v>

188
00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:32.380
<v Speaker 2>same basic idea and company,</v>

189
00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:36.260
<v Speaker 2>not the demand for such impossibilities as equality of outcome,</v>

190
00:08:36.261 --> 00:08:38.630
<v Speaker 2>which is unbelievably dangerous idea.</v>

191
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.560
<v Speaker 2>It's the same ideology.</v>

192
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:45.620
<v Speaker 2>It's just dressed up in more current clothing and it's,</v>

193
00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:46.310
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

194
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:48.200
<v Speaker 2>it's going to lead to the same place,</v>

195
00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:51.200
<v Speaker 2>so unless we want to go there,</v>

196
00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:55.950
<v Speaker 2>which I wouldn't recommend since we've already visited and founded unpleasant,</v>

197
00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:01.170
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me that we should pick a different path and dispense with the</v>

198
00:09:01.171 --> 00:09:06.171
<v Speaker 2>identity politics both on the left and on the right and go back to what we got</v>

199
00:09:07.321 --> 00:09:08.154
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

200
00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:11.550
<v Speaker 2>The thing that makes me a little different than the classic liberal,</v>

201
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:15.930
<v Speaker 2>I guess in some senses that there's probably more emphasis from the liberal land</v>

202
00:09:15.931 --> 00:09:17.880
<v Speaker 2>on individual freedom.</v>

203
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:22.170
<v Speaker 2>Whereas I put a tremendous amount of emphasis on individual responsibility.</v>

204
00:09:22.171 --> 00:09:26.730
<v Speaker 2>But the union between those two things would be the emphasis on the individual.</v>

205
00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:28.350
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

206
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:30.630
<v Speaker 2>So in 12 rules for life,</v>

207
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:34.980
<v Speaker 2>a lot of what I'm trying to inform people off,</v>

208
00:09:34.981 --> 00:09:35.491
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

209
00:09:35.491 --> 00:09:40.491
<v Speaker 2>is that they can take on very heavy responsibility for life in all of its</v>

210
00:09:41.431 --> 00:09:46.431
<v Speaker 2>tragedy and let's malevolence and prevail and that that's what they should do.</v>

211
00:09:46.891 --> 00:09:49.080
<v Speaker 2>And that's the right way to set the world straight.</v>

212
00:09:49.081 --> 00:09:50.280
<v Speaker 2>It's the honorable way.</v>

213
00:09:50.281 --> 00:09:51.660
<v Speaker 2>It's the noble way.</v>

214
00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:53.220
<v Speaker 2>And it works too.</v>

215
00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:54.323
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

216
00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.070
<v Speaker 2>it's not naive optimism.</v>

217
00:09:56.071 --> 00:09:57.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a naive optimist.</v>

218
00:09:57.631 --> 00:09:59.460
<v Speaker 2>I know how terrible the world is,</v>

219
00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:01.500
<v Speaker 2>but I still think that we can,</v>

220
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:07.160
<v Speaker 2>we can live in it like admirable beings and we can make it much better than it</v>

221
00:10:07.501 --> 00:10:08.071
<v Speaker 2>is now.</v>

222
00:10:08.071 --> 00:10:12.330
<v Speaker 2>We can start with ourselves and I think that's the right path forward.</v>

223
00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:13.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

224
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.491
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

225
00:10:13.491 --> 00:10:16.490
<v Speaker 1>and I want to get into 12 rules of life and they edit out to chaos,</v>

226
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:17.030
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

227
00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:17.271
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

228
00:10:17.271 --> 00:10:17.871
<v Speaker 1>in a moment.</v>

229
00:10:17.871 --> 00:10:19.010
<v Speaker 1>It's a fantastic book.</v>

230
00:10:19.011 --> 00:10:19.370
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

231
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:20.510
<v Speaker 1>and as of right now,</v>

232
00:10:20.511 --> 00:10:20.811
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

233
00:10:20.811 --> 00:10:23.210
<v Speaker 1>it's number two on the Amazon bestseller list.</v>

234
00:10:23.211 --> 00:10:24.710
<v Speaker 1>So congratulations on that.</v>

235
00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:25.790
<v Speaker 1>But it sounds like you've,</v>

236
00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:26.130
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>

237
00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:27.200
<v Speaker 1>and what I've read here,</v>

238
00:10:27.201 --> 00:10:29.000
<v Speaker 1>you've surrounded yourself,</v>

239
00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:29.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

240
00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:29.991
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

241
00:10:29.991 --> 00:10:32.030
<v Speaker 1>with understanding this to the point where,</v>

242
00:10:32.031 --> 00:10:33.230
<v Speaker 1>and I was a little surprised,</v>

243
00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:33.770
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

244
00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:34.011
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

245
00:10:34.011 --> 00:10:34.641
<v Speaker 1>Norman Doidge,</v>

246
00:10:34.641 --> 00:10:38.390
<v Speaker 1>he wrote the forward in your book 12 rules of life and he says that you have an</v>

247
00:10:38.391 --> 00:10:43.040
<v Speaker 1>expansive art collection of socialist realist paintings of Lenin and early</v>

248
00:10:43.041 --> 00:10:43.611
<v Speaker 1>communists.</v>

249
00:10:43.611 --> 00:10:48.410
<v Speaker 1>He explains it so that you never forget the hundreds of millions of people who</v>

250
00:10:48.411 --> 00:10:51.170
<v Speaker 1>were murdered in the name of Utopia.</v>

251
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.120
<v Speaker 1>What about this ideology,</v>

252
00:10:53.121 --> 00:10:54.860
<v Speaker 1>this horror,</v>

253
00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:55.640
<v Speaker 1>if you will,</v>

254
00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.280
<v Speaker 1>of human suffering that steered you into studying it?</v>

255
00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:00.211
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

256
00:11:00.211 --> 00:11:02.550
<v Speaker 2>it seemed to me when I started studying it,</v>

257
00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:03.540
<v Speaker 2>the 1980s,</v>

258
00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:08.960
<v Speaker 2>we were still in the midst of the CEW award and hosted a genuine threat not only</v>

259
00:11:09.391 --> 00:11:12.330
<v Speaker 2>to the lives of every individual on the planet,</v>

260
00:11:12.331 --> 00:11:13.500
<v Speaker 2>but too well,</v>

261
00:11:13.501 --> 00:11:14.760
<v Speaker 2>but to life itself.</v>

262
00:11:14.761 --> 00:11:19.761
<v Speaker 2>And it seemed to me that there was no problem that required solving more urgent</v>

263
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:26.990
<v Speaker 2>urgently then the problem of pathological group identification and the conflict</v>

264
00:11:29.041 --> 00:11:30.090
<v Speaker 2>that emerges out of it.</v>

265
00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:31.321
<v Speaker 2>And the more,</v>

266
00:11:31.321 --> 00:11:32.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>

267
00:11:32.391 --> 00:11:33.224
<v Speaker 2>I took,</v>

268
00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:38.990
<v Speaker 2>I took what happened in Nazi Germany and did in the Soviet Union and malice</v>

269
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.650
<v Speaker 2>China with deep seriousness considering it,</v>

270
00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:45.541
<v Speaker 2>what would you call it,</v>

271
00:11:45.541 --> 00:11:48.990
<v Speaker 2>up a sign of the illness that be set all of humanity,</v>

272
00:11:48.991 --> 00:11:53.040
<v Speaker 2>not just those countries and believe that there was no problem.</v>

273
00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:54.550
<v Speaker 2>That was more,</v>

274
00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:58.660
<v Speaker 2>it was more necessary to take seriously and to try to solve.</v>

275
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:04.200
<v Speaker 2>And so that's guided me since probably since the late 1970s I've put all my</v>

276
00:12:05.021 --> 00:12:10.021
<v Speaker 2>effort and teaching pretty much into understanding group identification at a</v>

277
00:12:11.951 --> 00:12:13.240
<v Speaker 2>psychological level,</v>

278
00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:18.550
<v Speaker 2>trying to account for the ideological possession and then trying to figure out a</v>

279
00:12:18.551 --> 00:12:23.551
<v Speaker 2>way through it so that people were neither nihilistic nor puppets of right or</v>

280
00:12:24.251 --> 00:12:27.700
<v Speaker 2>left wing ideology trying to find out what the alternative to that was.</v>

281
00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:32.770
<v Speaker 2>And I think that responsible individuality,</v>

282
00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:34.361
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

283
00:12:34.361 --> 00:12:39.361
<v Speaker 2>with respect for society and the group is the right,</v>

284
00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.820
<v Speaker 2>I think we got the answer right in the west and I think that's why the West</v>

285
00:12:42.821 --> 00:12:44.200
<v Speaker 2>isn't complete hell.</v>

286
00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:47.770
<v Speaker 2>Like so many countries are so many places.</v>

287
00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:52.120
<v Speaker 2>Are you concerned this wave authoritarianism is sweeping across North America?</v>

288
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:53.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean we see it in the schools.</v>

289
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:57.040
<v Speaker 2>You became famous obviously because of the Toronto,</v>

290
00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:57.351
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

291
00:12:57.351 --> 00:12:59.570
<v Speaker 2>University of Toronto was situation with a,</v>

292
00:12:59.571 --> 00:13:04.300
<v Speaker 2>with the law for the transgender usage of words that you were forced to have to</v>

293
00:13:04.301 --> 00:13:05.050
<v Speaker 2>say.</v>

294
00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:05.710
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

295
00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:06.011
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

296
00:13:06.011 --> 00:13:07.270
<v Speaker 2>do the college administrators,</v>

297
00:13:07.271 --> 00:13:11.380
<v Speaker 2>many of them who went at academia when they adverted the Vietnam war themselves,</v>

298
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:14.410
<v Speaker 2>does just the society just wait for them to all die off?</v>

299
00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:16.060
<v Speaker 2>What does this end,</v>

300
00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:18.070
<v Speaker 2>well that's a good question.</v>

301
00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:18.661
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

302
00:13:18.661 --> 00:13:19.494
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

303
00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:24.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what's going to happen with the universities because the humanities</v>

304
00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:29.620
<v Speaker 2>are completely dominated by postmodern radical left cause it's,</v>

305
00:13:29.621 --> 00:13:32.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean the documentation for that is clear.</v>

306
00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:33.893
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

307
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.180
<v Speaker 2>I think what will happen is they'll just run out of the audience.</v>

308
00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:41.590
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm hoping will happen is that people will wake up and think,</v>

309
00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:42.821
<v Speaker 2>oh Jesus,</v>

310
00:13:42.821 --> 00:13:43.870
<v Speaker 2>this isn't education.</v>

311
00:13:43.871 --> 00:13:48.460
<v Speaker 2>This is indoctrination and this is a pessimistic and pathological view of the</v>

312
00:13:48.461 --> 00:13:48.791
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

313
00:13:48.791 --> 00:13:53.791
<v Speaker 2>All we'll do is produce increasing division and hatred between groups and we'd</v>

314
00:13:54.071 --> 00:13:55.300
<v Speaker 2>go better things to do.</v>

315
00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:59.110
<v Speaker 2>So I'm hoping that people will turn away from those disciplines in those</v>

316
00:13:59.111 --> 00:13:59.830
<v Speaker 2>courses.</v>

317
00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:02.500
<v Speaker 2>The problem is they often don't know that that's what they're going to be</v>

318
00:14:02.501 --> 00:14:03.334
<v Speaker 2>exposed to.</v>

319
00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:06.850
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

320
00:14:06.851 --> 00:14:11.440
<v Speaker 2>who has Lincoln said you can fool all of the people some of the time,</v>

321
00:14:11.441 --> 00:14:13.870
<v Speaker 2>but you can't fool all of the people all of the time.</v>

322
00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:14.770
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

323
00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:16.330
<v Speaker 2>So can I hope,</v>

324
00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:21.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm hoping that people are waking up and if they can find something better to do</v>

325
00:14:21.671 --> 00:14:25.660
<v Speaker 2>with their lives than to become chronically resentful,</v>

326
00:14:25.661 --> 00:14:30.661
<v Speaker 2>professional protesters and and instigators of group conflict under the name of</v>

327
00:14:31.391 --> 00:14:33.430
<v Speaker 2>some kind of compassionate morality.</v>

328
00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:35.043
<v Speaker 2>It's complete.</v>

329
00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:39.010
<v Speaker 2>It's completely reprehensible as far as I can tell.</v>

330
00:14:39.011 --> 00:14:40.240
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing in it's good.</v>

331
00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:45.370
<v Speaker 2>Now it isn't to say that there's nothing to be said on the left side of the</v>

332
00:14:45.371 --> 00:14:46.360
<v Speaker 2>political spectrum.</v>

333
00:14:46.361 --> 00:14:51.361
<v Speaker 2>Like I know full well that inequality tends to grow and then as it grows,</v>

334
00:14:54.081 --> 00:14:56.420
<v Speaker 2>it threatens the structure of society.</v>

335
00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:00.950
<v Speaker 2>There has to be a voice for people who are on the dispossessed end of the</v>

336
00:15:00.951 --> 00:15:01.850
<v Speaker 2>distribution.</v>

337
00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:07.520
<v Speaker 2>And so I think there's a perfectly reasonable place for an informed left wing</v>

338
00:15:07.521 --> 00:15:11.840
<v Speaker 2>who basically speaks for those who have not managed to be or who didn't have any</v>

339
00:15:11.841 --> 00:15:13.490
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to be successful.</v>

340
00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:18.820
<v Speaker 2>But that's not the same as dividing this up into identity groups based on gender</v>

341
00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:22.490
<v Speaker 2>and eternally playing oppressive versus victim.</v>

342
00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:24.200
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

343
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:29.200
<v Speaker 1>Our normal relations between human beings is what you're referring to the left</v>

344
00:15:29.301 --> 00:15:32.930
<v Speaker 1>now trying to mediate that or do they want the state to mediate that?</v>

345
00:15:32.931 --> 00:15:34.070
<v Speaker 1>What is their end game here?</v>

346
00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.073
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

347
00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:36.811
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

348
00:15:36.811 --> 00:15:41.580
<v Speaker 2>The end game hypothetically is a state where of radical equality of outcome.</v>

349
00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:46.770
<v Speaker 2>Nowhere no one has any more of anything than anyone else and also no less.</v>

350
00:15:46.771 --> 00:15:49.950
<v Speaker 2>But that's a completely impossible goal.</v>

351
00:15:49.951 --> 00:15:51.060
<v Speaker 2>That will never happen.</v>

352
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:51.791
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

353
00:15:51.791 --> 00:15:53.400
<v Speaker 2>as I'm a sole pointed out,</v>

354
00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:58.830
<v Speaker 2>if you give the state enough power to legislate equality of outcome,</v>

355
00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:03.290
<v Speaker 2>you've also given the state enough power so that it is certain that it would</v>

356
00:16:03.291 --> 00:16:05.820
<v Speaker 2>become a tyrant and I believe that.</v>

357
00:16:05.821 --> 00:16:09.720
<v Speaker 2>But I think that there are people in the ideological camps,</v>

358
00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:11.520
<v Speaker 2>both on the right on the left,</v>

359
00:16:11.521 --> 00:16:13.890
<v Speaker 2>but we're talking about the left at the moment.</v>

360
00:16:13.891 --> 00:16:17.820
<v Speaker 2>Who would be happy to see everything burned down as long as those who were</v>

361
00:16:17.821 --> 00:16:21.240
<v Speaker 2>successful were destroyed along with it.</v>

362
00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:22.081
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>

363
00:16:22.081 --> 00:16:23.290
<v Speaker 2>that certainly happened in,</v>

364
00:16:23.291 --> 00:16:24.090
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

365
00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:26.490
<v Speaker 2>in the Communist countries during the 20th century,</v>

366
00:16:26.491 --> 00:16:31.491
<v Speaker 2>there was a tremendous underground sense of resentment and hatred that motivated</v>

367
00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:37.650
<v Speaker 2>the destruction of whole classes of successful people.</v>

368
00:16:37.651 --> 00:16:38.484
<v Speaker 2>Like the,</v>

369
00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:40.200
<v Speaker 2>like the successful farmers,</v>

370
00:16:40.201 --> 00:16:44.820
<v Speaker 2>the Kulaks that were all killed in the 1920s so</v>

371
00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:48.270
<v Speaker 2>who knows what the end game is,</v>

372
00:16:48.271 --> 00:16:49.350
<v Speaker 2>what they say,</v>

373
00:16:49.351 --> 00:16:51.810
<v Speaker 2>what it is fairly straight forwardly yeah,</v>

374
00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:52.950
<v Speaker 2>it's the destruction,</v>

375
00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:54.270
<v Speaker 2>the patriarchy.</v>

376
00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:55.553
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

377
00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:57.990
<v Speaker 2>that speaks for itself.</v>

378
00:16:59.220 --> 00:16:59.461
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

379
00:16:59.461 --> 00:17:01.800
<v Speaker 1>what are the greatest quotes I've read from you is,</v>

380
00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:05.040
<v Speaker 1>is human beings are born with different capacities.</v>

381
00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:06.240
<v Speaker 1>If they are free,</v>

382
00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:10.410
<v Speaker 1>they are not equal and if they are equal than they are not free.</v>

383
00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:13.450
<v Speaker 2>I think that was originally Milton Friedman.</v>

384
00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:14.020
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

385
00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:14.860
<v Speaker 2>was it Milton?</v>

386
00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:15.561
<v Speaker 2>He so,</v>

387
00:17:15.561 --> 00:17:15.831
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

388
00:17:15.831 --> 00:17:16.031
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>

389
00:17:16.031 --> 00:17:16.720
<v Speaker 2>Melty.</v>

390
00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:17.553
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

391
00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:19.940
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

392
00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:20.300
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

393
00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:21.670
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely the case.</v>

394
00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:22.683
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

395
00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:28.320
<v Speaker 2>the problem with equality of outcome arguments is well across what dimension are</v>

396
00:17:29.081 --> 00:17:33.040
<v Speaker 2>you going to ensure that no one has any more friends than anyone else?</v>

397
00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:33.711
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

398
00:17:33.711 --> 00:17:38.260
<v Speaker 2>no one is going to have any more lovers or no one has a bigger art collection or</v>

399
00:17:38.261 --> 00:17:42.820
<v Speaker 2>no one's better at playing music or has a larger library.</v>

400
00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:47.050
<v Speaker 2>Where are you going to stop with the demands for equality?</v>

401
00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:53.370
<v Speaker 2>There's no stopping place and people don't even want the same outcomes.</v>

402
00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:55.620
<v Speaker 2>So it's</v>

403
00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:58.651
<v Speaker 2>people are,</v>

404
00:17:58.651 --> 00:18:01.440
<v Speaker 2>the thing about freedom is that people are free to be different.</v>

405
00:18:01.441 --> 00:18:02.220
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

406
00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:02.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

407
00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:07.350
<v Speaker 2>the price we pay for that to some degree is the inevitability of comparative</v>

408
00:18:07.351 --> 00:18:08.190
<v Speaker 2>failure.</v>

409
00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:12.930
<v Speaker 2>But the Marxists liked to blame inequality on capitalism.</v>

410
00:18:12.931 --> 00:18:16.530
<v Speaker 2>And that's the one of the biggest technical mistakes they make because</v>

411
00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:21.390
<v Speaker 2>inequality is the rule in natural and social systems alike.</v>

412
00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:26.390
<v Speaker 2>So the populations are distributed equally in cities and mass is distributed</v>

413
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:33.830
<v Speaker 2>unequally in stars and trees are of different heights in the rain forest,</v>

414
00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:39.960
<v Speaker 2>all following the same inequality distribution that characterizes,</v>

415
00:18:39.961 --> 00:18:41.370
<v Speaker 2>say income or wealth.</v>

416
00:18:41.371 --> 00:18:42.200
<v Speaker 2>In a,</v>

417
00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.620
<v Speaker 2>in a human society,</v>

418
00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:49.250
<v Speaker 2>the inequality problem is much deeper than it can't be laid at the feet of</v>

419
00:18:49.471 --> 00:18:50.131
<v Speaker 2>capitalism.</v>

420
00:18:50.131 --> 00:18:51.420
<v Speaker 2>It's a foolish analysis,</v>

421
00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:52.040
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

422
00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:54.660
<v Speaker 2>but inequality is still a problem and it has to be dealt with.</v>

423
00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:55.890
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

424
00:18:55.890 --> 00:19:00.890
<v Speaker 2>but the idea that it can be eradicated in some permanent forum and that the cure</v>

425
00:19:01.651 --> 00:19:06.651
<v Speaker 2>would be better than the disease is naive at best,</v>

426
00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:08.280
<v Speaker 2>willfully blind,</v>

427
00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:09.990
<v Speaker 2>most certainly,</v>

428
00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:12.990
<v Speaker 2>and malevolent in most cases.</v>

429
00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:15.510
<v Speaker 2>It's mostly based on resentment and jealousy,</v>

430
00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:21.270
<v Speaker 2>especially in North America because the typical person in North America is rich</v>

431
00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:25.050
<v Speaker 2>beyond the wildest imaginings of people a hundred years ago.</v>

432
00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:26.191
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

433
00:19:26.191 --> 00:19:30.990
<v Speaker 2>So even if you're relatively poor in North America,</v>

434
00:19:30.991 --> 00:19:33.180
<v Speaker 2>you have central heating,</v>

435
00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:34.560
<v Speaker 2>you have running water,</v>

436
00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:39.830
<v Speaker 2>you have computational technology that puts $1 trillion worth of information</v>

437
00:19:39.901 --> 00:19:41.640
<v Speaker 2>every moment at your fingertips.</v>

438
00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:42.751
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

439
00:19:42.751 --> 00:19:43.584
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

440
00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:44.820
<v Speaker 2>we're so rich.</v>

441
00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:46.101
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

442
00:19:46.101 --> 00:19:49.910
<v Speaker 1>And people don't have to worry about being torn apart by animals or freezing to</v>

443
00:19:49.911 --> 00:19:51.110
<v Speaker 1>death or anything like that.</v>

444
00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:52.130
<v Speaker 1>It's a big difference.</v>

445
00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:53.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

446
00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:55.540
<v Speaker 2>And it's very unlikely to.</v>

447
00:19:55.541 --> 00:20:00.541
<v Speaker 2>So the other thing I've been trying to point out is that we should try to muster</v>

448
00:20:00.941 --> 00:20:03.550
<v Speaker 2>up a little bit of gratitude for it.</v>

449
00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:09.040
<v Speaker 1>What are the biggest challenges men and women both have is finding the perfect</v>

450
00:20:09.041 --> 00:20:10.270
<v Speaker 1>gift for a man,</v>

451
00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:12.760
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a significant other father,</v>

452
00:20:12.761 --> 00:20:13.331
<v Speaker 1>son,</v>

453
00:20:13.331 --> 00:20:14.164
<v Speaker 1>friend,</v>

454
00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:16.120
<v Speaker 1>could be a coworker or your boss,</v>

455
00:20:16.121 --> 00:20:17.350
<v Speaker 1>somebody you play golf with.</v>

456
00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:18.130
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

457
00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:20.230
<v Speaker 1>it's never easy to find that gift.</v>

458
00:20:20.231 --> 00:20:24.100
<v Speaker 1>And many of us end up just getting a gift card and it's quick and it's easy,</v>

459
00:20:24.101 --> 00:20:25.480
<v Speaker 1>but it's also quite boring.</v>

460
00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:28.000
<v Speaker 1>And now with Valentine's Day coming up,</v>

461
00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:28.631
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

462
00:20:28.631 --> 00:20:29.464
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

463
00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:31.840
<v Speaker 1>we all realize it's a cheesy hallmark holiday,</v>

464
00:20:31.841 --> 00:20:35.620
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't mean that you have to get that guy at cheesy hallmark gift.</v>

465
00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:41.040
<v Speaker 1>The solution is [inaudible] dot com it's the only place to find awesome gifts</v>

466
00:20:41.861 --> 00:20:42.970
<v Speaker 1>that guys love.</v>

467
00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:48.210
<v Speaker 1>Now it isn't some Cologne sampler or cheesy mug man offers a curated gift</v>

468
00:20:48.851 --> 00:20:51.130
<v Speaker 1>collection for every type of guy.</v>

469
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:56.430
<v Speaker 1>There's different collections for the sports fanatic home chef and outdoorsman.</v>

470
00:20:57.130 --> 00:21:00.550
<v Speaker 1>If you're interested in cigars or whiskey or beer,</v>

471
00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:05.720
<v Speaker 1>check out classics like the NFL barware crate and the whiskey appreciation</v>

472
00:21:05.981 --> 00:21:06.640
<v Speaker 1>crate,</v>

473
00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:11.350
<v Speaker 1>or a fresh takes on traditional Valentine's day gifts like the jerky heart or</v>

474
00:21:11.351 --> 00:21:13.870
<v Speaker 1>the Salami Bow k and it always cracks me up.</v>

475
00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:14.860
<v Speaker 1>It looks good.</v>

476
00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:16.510
<v Speaker 1>It looks really yummy.</v>

477
00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:17.381
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

478
00:21:17.381 --> 00:21:21.040
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you're a mad opening up a whole crate of Salami.</v>

479
00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:25.900
<v Speaker 1>Go to man crates.com pick the perfect gift and then wait for that magic to</v>

480
00:21:25.901 --> 00:21:26.500
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

481
00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:26.651
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

482
00:21:26.651 --> 00:21:31.060
<v Speaker 1>what's going to happen is that it's going to be delivered literally in a crate,</v>

483
00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:31.990
<v Speaker 1>hence the name,</v>

484
00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:36.790
<v Speaker 1>and there's no way to open it unless they use a crowbar which happens to be</v>

485
00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:37.653
<v Speaker 1>included.</v>

486
00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:43.020
<v Speaker 1>So part of that gift is just getting a guy to get a box open with a crowbar cue.</v>

487
00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.930
<v Speaker 1>The Tim Allen voice a voice,</v>

494
00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:15.530
<v Speaker 1>I have a few questions for you from ricochet members here.</v>

495
00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:17.240
<v Speaker 1>Many of our ricochet members,</v>

496
00:22:17.241 --> 00:22:18.100
<v Speaker 1>you pseudonyms.</v>

497
00:22:18.101 --> 00:22:20.300
<v Speaker 1>So you might hear a couple of funny sounding names here,</v>

498
00:22:20.301 --> 00:22:21.320
<v Speaker 1>but the first one doesn't.</v>

499
00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:22.730
<v Speaker 1>His name is Brian Watt,</v>

500
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.200
<v Speaker 1>and he asks,</v>

501
00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:27.530
<v Speaker 1>what do you think of the current pope and his apparent leaning?</v>

502
00:22:27.531 --> 00:22:30.530
<v Speaker 1>Some might say anticapitalist pro socialists,</v>

503
00:22:30.531 --> 00:22:32.810
<v Speaker 1>perhaps postmodernist outlook on life.</v>

504
00:22:32.811 --> 00:22:37.811
<v Speaker 1>Does he find the current Catholic hierarchy helpful or a hindrance and standing</v>

505
00:22:38.091 --> 00:22:40.130
<v Speaker 1>up against the wave of postmodernist,</v>

506
00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:44.840
<v Speaker 1>neo Marxist indoctrination and propaganda throughout Western societies?</v>

507
00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:46.793
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

508
00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:51.850
<v Speaker 2>I would say I probably don't know enough to really answer that question</v>

509
00:22:51.851 --> 00:22:52.870
<v Speaker 2>intelligently.</v>

510
00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:55.720
<v Speaker 2>It's necessary generally speaking,</v>

511
00:22:55.721 --> 00:23:00.721
<v Speaker 2>for the Catholic Church to err on the side of compassion for the poor and</v>

512
00:23:02.411 --> 00:23:03.760
<v Speaker 2>dispossessed so we could say,</v>

513
00:23:03.761 --> 00:23:04.450
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

514
00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:07.000
<v Speaker 2>perhaps that's what the current pope is doing,</v>

515
00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:12.270
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know enough about his doctrines and aims to provide a criticism</v>

516
00:23:13.531 --> 00:23:15.390
<v Speaker 2>that's any more intelligent than that.</v>

517
00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:17.503
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

518
00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:21.530
<v Speaker 1>A second one is from judge mental told you he had some great pseudonyms here.</v>

519
00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:24.200
<v Speaker 1>Judgemental asks you,</v>

520
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:26.270
<v Speaker 1>what do you think will be the next battlefield?</v>

521
00:23:26.271 --> 00:23:30.680
<v Speaker 1>We've gotten to the point where even gender is now set to be up for grabs.</v>

522
00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:32.000
<v Speaker 1>What does it go from here?</v>

523
00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:33.693
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

524
00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:39.600
<v Speaker 2>There'll be babbling over whether or not scientific truth is acceptable as truth</v>

525
00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:43.000
<v Speaker 2>or just another form of power,</v>

526
00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:44.980
<v Speaker 2>power play power.</v>

527
00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:46.640
<v Speaker 2>That's already happening.</v>

528
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:48.343
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

529
00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:53.350
<v Speaker 2>there'll be in the soul to him the idea of qualitative diff distinctions per se.</v>

530
00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:55.760
<v Speaker 2>The idea that one thing is better than another,</v>

531
00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:59.390
<v Speaker 2>that'll come under attack and all sorts of different dimensions that's already</v>

532
00:23:59.391 --> 00:24:00.224
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>

533
00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:01.733
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

534
00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:03.770
<v Speaker 2>because the problem is,</v>

535
00:24:03.771 --> 00:24:06.320
<v Speaker 2>is that if you allow for qualitative distinctions,</v>

536
00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:10.310
<v Speaker 2>so if you allow for the suggestion that one thing is better than another,</v>

537
00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:14.000
<v Speaker 2>then you rationalize the existence of inequality.</v>

538
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:19.670
<v Speaker 2>Because if one thing is better than another and people provide the better thing,</v>

539
00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:22.760
<v Speaker 2>then you can make a case that they should succeed,</v>

540
00:24:22.761 --> 00:24:23.780
<v Speaker 2>where others should fail,</v>

541
00:24:23.781 --> 00:24:25.130
<v Speaker 2>and that produces inequality.</v>

542
00:24:25.131 --> 00:24:30.131
<v Speaker 2>So the radical argument against inequality has to end in the destruction of the</v>

543
00:24:31.161 --> 00:24:33.350
<v Speaker 2>idea of value distinctions themselves.</v>

544
00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:34.660
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's part of,</v>

545
00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:36.620
<v Speaker 2>that's built into postmodernism anyways.</v>

546
00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:38.540
<v Speaker 2>That's the sacrifice they're willing to make.</v>

547
00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:43.010
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to see more of an outright attack on biology,</v>

548
00:24:43.011 --> 00:24:46.670
<v Speaker 2>especially evolutionary biology and psychology that's already happening.</v>

549
00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:48.050
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

550
00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:53.050
<v Speaker 2>and assault on the idea that scientific truth has some sort of privileged status</v>

551
00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:54.380
<v Speaker 2>that's already happening.</v>

552
00:24:55.190 --> 00:25:00.190
<v Speaker 2>So we'll see an assault on the idea that there's any such thing as an objective</v>

553
00:25:02.211 --> 00:25:04.970
<v Speaker 2>of education that's already happening in Canada,</v>

554
00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:08.330
<v Speaker 2>in Ontario with the elementary teachers,</v>

555
00:25:08.331 --> 00:25:12.020
<v Speaker 2>federation has already decided that the purpose of education from kindergarten</v>

556
00:25:12.021 --> 00:25:15.890
<v Speaker 2>to grade eight is to produce students with a social justice activist</v>

557
00:25:15.891 --> 00:25:16.724
<v Speaker 2>orientation.</v>

558
00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:21.260
<v Speaker 2>And they've even selected all the literature that the kids will be exposed to in</v>

559
00:25:21.261 --> 00:25:24.020
<v Speaker 2>order to foster that India logical perspective.</v>

560
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

561
00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:27.020
<v Speaker 2>that's right out in the open and that's on their website.</v>

562
00:25:27.021 --> 00:25:28.130
<v Speaker 2>It's part of the curriculum.</v>

563
00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:29.620
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

564
00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:33.580
<v Speaker 1>so is this a devaluing of empirical evidence then that we just don't believe</v>

565
00:25:33.581 --> 00:25:34.414
<v Speaker 1>anything anymore?</v>

566
00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:37.940
<v Speaker 2>We believe what the postmodern ideas that you believe,</v>

567
00:25:37.941 --> 00:25:40.340
<v Speaker 2>whatever fosters the interest of your group.</v>

568
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:43.240
<v Speaker 2>There's no truth above that.</v>

569
00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:44.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

570
00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:45.320
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

571
00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:47.600
<v Speaker 2>it's an absolutely dismal hypothesis.</v>

572
00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:48.523
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

573
00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:48.811
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

574
00:25:48.811 --> 00:25:50.700
<v Speaker 1>as people were asking questions of you,</v>

575
00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:51.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

576
00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:51.451
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

577
00:25:51.451 --> 00:25:54.510
<v Speaker 1>in our forum and interesting discussion between ricochet members,</v>

578
00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:56.490
<v Speaker 1>NFE and front seat cat occurred,</v>

579
00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:57.510
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

580
00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:59.450
<v Speaker 1>pseudonyms occurred in,</v>

581
00:25:59.451 --> 00:26:03.600
<v Speaker 1>in relation to your interview with Kathy Newman and pertaining specifically to</v>

582
00:26:03.601 --> 00:26:04.770
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness.</v>

583
00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:10.070
<v Speaker 1>Now remember Anna fee told her sister who was angry over not being paid as much</v>

584
00:26:10.501 --> 00:26:15.240
<v Speaker 1>as a male coworker to go and make the case to her boss and demand more money.</v>

585
00:26:15.241 --> 00:26:17.160
<v Speaker 1>Now I know anesthesia is a strong willed woman.</v>

586
00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:22.970
<v Speaker 1>Now her sister felt her work should speak for itself and front seat cat,</v>

587
00:26:23.491 --> 00:26:28.140
<v Speaker 1>another member agreed with NFE sister that she shouldn't have had to ask that</v>

588
00:26:28.141 --> 00:26:32.790
<v Speaker 1>the raise was then about behavior and not about the quality of work.</v>

589
00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:34.950
<v Speaker 1>You referred to agreeableness,</v>

590
00:26:34.951 --> 00:26:35.310
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

591
00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:38.670
<v Speaker 1>and not gender as the reason people may not achieve their potential.</v>

592
00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:40.440
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the reasons,</v>

593
00:26:40.441 --> 00:26:42.510
<v Speaker 2>there's many reasons for pay differential,</v>

594
00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:46.140
<v Speaker 2>but not only do you have to do good work,</v>

595
00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:50.340
<v Speaker 2>you have to be seen to do good work and you have to make a case for it.</v>

596
00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:52.950
<v Speaker 2>It's like in the best of all possible worlds.</v>

597
00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:56.970
<v Speaker 2>He would sit back and your accomplishments would speak for themselves.</v>

598
00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:01.650
<v Speaker 2>But that assumes that the people that you're talking to have enough time to even</v>

599
00:27:01.651 --> 00:27:04.110
<v Speaker 2>pay attention to what you're doing and notice.</v>

600
00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:05.940
<v Speaker 2>And that's often not the case,</v>

601
00:27:05.941 --> 00:27:09.390
<v Speaker 2>especially if if you're a quiet worker and you're competent,</v>

602
00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:12.240
<v Speaker 2>the price you pay for that is in visibility.</v>

603
00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:14.370
<v Speaker 2>And people,</v>

604
00:27:14.371 --> 00:27:14.881
<v Speaker 2>you'd think,</v>

605
00:27:14.881 --> 00:27:15.031
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

606
00:27:15.031 --> 00:27:16.210
<v Speaker 2>people should notice what we're,</v>

607
00:27:16.211 --> 00:27:19.650
<v Speaker 2>what we're doing and rewarded and they probably should.</v>

608
00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:25.130
<v Speaker 2>But that doesn't mean that you lack all responsibility in making your case</v>

609
00:27:25.141 --> 00:27:25.974
<v Speaker 2>known.</v>

610
00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:29.160
<v Speaker 2>And most of the time a boss,</v>

611
00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:33.420
<v Speaker 2>a manager who's busy doing 150 different things,</v>

612
00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:34.950
<v Speaker 2>isn't going to</v>

613
00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:42.080
<v Speaker 2>be alert constantly enough to make sure that your career is being fostered in</v>

614
00:27:42.391 --> 00:27:43.860
<v Speaker 2>the optimal possible manner.</v>

615
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:45.450
<v Speaker 2>You might have to make a case.</v>

616
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:49.710
<v Speaker 2>Often people don't even know what you're doing if you're competent.</v>

617
00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:53.970
<v Speaker 2>And so I think it's a very naive view of the world to say,</v>

618
00:27:53.971 --> 00:27:54.301
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

619
00:27:54.301 --> 00:27:55.860
<v Speaker 2>my work should speak for itself.</v>

620
00:27:55.861 --> 00:27:56.694
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

621
00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:57.330
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

622
00:27:57.330 --> 00:28:00.990
<v Speaker 2>the wouldn't be advertising if people's work could speak for itself.</v>

623
00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.550
<v Speaker 2>And there wouldn't be marketing,</v>

624
00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:03.900
<v Speaker 2>there wouldn't be sales,</v>

625
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:05.040
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

626
00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:06.690
<v Speaker 2>And for most products,</v>

627
00:28:06.691 --> 00:28:07.171
<v Speaker 2>sales,</v>

628
00:28:07.171 --> 00:28:11.190
<v Speaker 2>marketing and advertising is like 75% of the product,</v>

629
00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:12.180
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

630
00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:16.470
<v Speaker 2>So it's just naive and it's not like money is just laying around.</v>

631
00:28:16.471 --> 00:28:17.450
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's after it.</v>

632
00:28:17.451 --> 00:28:18.840
<v Speaker 2>It's in scarce supply.</v>

633
00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:22.230
<v Speaker 2>And so if you want to develop your career,</v>

634
00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:25.410
<v Speaker 2>if you have some notion about how much money you need to make,</v>

635
00:28:25.411 --> 00:28:26.840
<v Speaker 2>then you have to go out there and,</v>

636
00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:31.560
<v Speaker 2>and strategically employ a plan to obtain that</v>

637
00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:35.850
<v Speaker 2>and learning how to promote yourself or stand up for yourself.</v>

638
00:28:35.851 --> 00:28:37.140
<v Speaker 2>And you've referred to this in your book,</v>

639
00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:39.030
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about standing up straight,</v>

640
00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:39.570
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

641
00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:42.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's about having confidence and belief in yourself.</v>

642
00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:43.561
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

643
00:28:43.561 --> 00:28:45.000
<v Speaker 2>Well if you lunch also,</v>

644
00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:49.860
<v Speaker 2>I also tell people in the book suggest to people that they consult the</v>

645
00:28:49.861 --> 00:28:50.601
<v Speaker 2>resentments.</v>

646
00:28:50.601 --> 00:28:51.630
<v Speaker 2>So let's say you're</v>

647
00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:55.530
<v Speaker 2>working way madly at your job,</v>

648
00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:58.050
<v Speaker 2>then you're very mouthy,</v>

649
00:28:58.051 --> 00:28:59.460
<v Speaker 2>but less competent.</v>

650
00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:04.820
<v Speaker 2>Coworker is getting paid more and it just starts to eat away at your heart and</v>

651
00:29:05.581 --> 00:29:08.130
<v Speaker 2>to poison your relationship with your work.</v>

652
00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:09.240
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

653
00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.710
<v Speaker 2>what should you do about that?</v>

654
00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:12.373
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

655
00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:18.000
<v Speaker 2>you should first of all notice that you're becoming resentful and then you</v>

656
00:29:18.001 --> 00:29:18.990
<v Speaker 2>should ask yourself,</v>

657
00:29:18.991 --> 00:29:19.824
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

658
00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:23.700
<v Speaker 2>am I just being whiny and neurotic and complaining?</v>

659
00:29:23.701 --> 00:29:25.710
<v Speaker 2>Or is there an actually an injustice here?</v>

660
00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:29.280
<v Speaker 2>And if the answer is there's actually an injustice,</v>

661
00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:32.460
<v Speaker 2>then you have to make your case and you,</v>

662
00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:36.780
<v Speaker 2>you do that so that you stop yourself from being resentful so that you can stay</v>

663
00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:38.670
<v Speaker 2>happy to be going to work.</v>

664
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.790
<v Speaker 2>And so that you can set the institution straight.</v>

665
00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:43.661
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

666
00:29:43.661 --> 00:29:46.000
<v Speaker 2>justice doesn't appear of its own accord.</v>

667
00:29:46.001 --> 00:29:48.730
<v Speaker 2>It's something you have to work for on your own behalf.</v>

668
00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:50.890
<v Speaker 2>Comes on the behalf of others.</v>

669
00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:52.983
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

670
00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:54.010
<v Speaker 2>it's like the,</v>

671
00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:57.850
<v Speaker 2>let's say you're a husband and you're a little bit too agreeable and you say</v>

672
00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:58.870
<v Speaker 2>your wife doesn't,</v>

673
00:29:59.010 --> 00:29:59.843
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

674
00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:03.370
<v Speaker 2>there's things that you need or want that your wife isn't providing.</v>

675
00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:04.660
<v Speaker 2>You won't talk to her.</v>

676
00:30:04.661 --> 00:30:05.021
<v Speaker 2>You say,</v>

677
00:30:05.021 --> 00:30:05.171
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

678
00:30:05.171 --> 00:30:06.280
<v Speaker 2>if she really loved me,</v>

679
00:30:06.281 --> 00:30:07.600
<v Speaker 2>she just know.</v>

680
00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:08.560
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

681
00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:09.393
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

682
00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:12.550
<v Speaker 2>she's not omniscient and you're not transparent.</v>

683
00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:14.320
<v Speaker 2>So you have to go and say,</v>

684
00:30:14.321 --> 00:30:14.621
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

685
00:30:14.621 --> 00:30:15.610
<v Speaker 2>here's what I want.</v>

686
00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:18.790
<v Speaker 2>You have to negotiate about it because maybe you don't get what you want.</v>

687
00:30:18.791 --> 00:30:19.750
<v Speaker 2>But maybe you do,</v>

688
00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:21.370
<v Speaker 2>here's what I want.</v>

689
00:30:21.371 --> 00:30:22.660
<v Speaker 2>Here's what would satisfy me.</v>

690
00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:24.340
<v Speaker 2>This is why it's important.</v>

691
00:30:24.341 --> 00:30:25.720
<v Speaker 2>This is what we need to do.</v>

692
00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:31.380
<v Speaker 2>And that's how you start the relationship from becoming an anachronistic and</v>

693
00:30:31.751 --> 00:30:32.231
<v Speaker 2>corrupt.</v>

694
00:30:32.231 --> 00:30:33.520
<v Speaker 2>And it's the same at work.</v>

695
00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:35.860
<v Speaker 2>You always have to fight for justice,</v>

696
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.820
<v Speaker 2>always,</v>

697
00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:37.653
<v Speaker 2>always.</v>

698
00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:38.471
<v Speaker 2>And why not?</v>

699
00:30:38.471 --> 00:30:38.921
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

700
00:30:38.921 --> 00:30:39.754
<v Speaker 2>you have to</v>

701
00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:42.680
<v Speaker 1>some of your critics after that interview,</v>

702
00:30:42.681 --> 00:30:43.730
<v Speaker 1>which went viral,</v>

703
00:30:43.731 --> 00:30:44.570
<v Speaker 1>it's insane.</v>

704
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:45.290
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

705
00:30:45.290 --> 00:30:48.380
<v Speaker 1>they refer to you some of the critics and it's very few of them by the way,</v>

706
00:30:48.381 --> 00:30:51.790
<v Speaker 1>that mostly in the media and academia they refer to as a massage earnest.</v>

707
00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:55.970
<v Speaker 1>Yet you say the greatest threat to women is a weak man.</v>

708
00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:57.080
<v Speaker 1>It seems.</v>

709
00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:58.130
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Peterson,</v>

710
00:30:58.130 --> 00:31:00.020
<v Speaker 1>we are surrounded by them today.</v>

711
00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:01.370
<v Speaker 1>Are men becoming weaker?</v>

712
00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:02.630
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

713
00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:06.290
<v Speaker 2>men are constantly told that if they were just harmless,</v>

714
00:31:06.291 --> 00:31:11.291
<v Speaker 2>the world would be a much better place if they were weakened few tile and you</v>

715
00:31:11.890 --> 00:31:12.510
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

716
00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:13.490
<v Speaker 2>constrained older,</v>

717
00:31:13.491 --> 00:31:17.420
<v Speaker 2>assertive and aggressive impulses and quit going out there and being so</v>

718
00:31:17.421 --> 00:31:19.520
<v Speaker 2>patriarchal and all of that.</v>

719
00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:24.730
<v Speaker 2>And it's mostly nonsense mean when you want for men is an extraordinary and</v>

720
00:31:25.131 --> 00:31:28.190
<v Speaker 2>women as well as an extraordinarily high level of competence.</v>

721
00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:31.880
<v Speaker 2>And most of our functional hierarchies are built on competence,</v>

722
00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:32.743
<v Speaker 2>not power.</v>

723
00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:37.880
<v Speaker 2>And why in the world would any woman want not want to have a man around who was</v>

724
00:31:37.881 --> 00:31:38.930
<v Speaker 2>competent and less.</v>

725
00:31:38.931 --> 00:31:41.630
<v Speaker 2>All she wanted was dumb to be dominant,</v>

726
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.740
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

727
00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:44.620
<v Speaker 2>And some of them would like that because they're there,</v>

728
00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:48.500
<v Speaker 2>they'd had their relationships with men damaged and they want to make sure that</v>

729
00:31:48.501 --> 00:31:51.590
<v Speaker 2>anybody that's around them is under their thumb because they're afraid of,</v>

730
00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:53.720
<v Speaker 2>while they're afraid of the alternative.</v>

731
00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:55.610
<v Speaker 2>But it's not a good way to live.</v>

732
00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:57.870
<v Speaker 2>And so this is how this whole,</v>

733
00:31:57.890 --> 00:31:59.660
<v Speaker 2>this misogyny ideas just,</v>

734
00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:01.340
<v Speaker 2>it's so absurd that it's,</v>

735
00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:01.701
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

736
00:32:01.701 --> 00:32:02.534
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

737
00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:04.670
<v Speaker 2>it's evidence of something else.</v>

738
00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:06.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm a reasonable person.</v>

739
00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:10.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't approve of what the radical leftists are up to.</v>

740
00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:14.870
<v Speaker 2>I know why what they're doing is pathological and where it's going to lead.</v>

741
00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:18.770
<v Speaker 2>I make the case strongly and reasonably.</v>

742
00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:21.410
<v Speaker 2>And because they have no defense of their ideas,</v>

743
00:32:21.411 --> 00:32:24.110
<v Speaker 2>what they do is target me with all sorts of epithets.</v>

744
00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:24.771
<v Speaker 2>Mean,</v>

745
00:32:24.771 --> 00:32:28.730
<v Speaker 2>I've had dozens of women in my clinical practice who I've been hell,</v>

746
00:32:28.731 --> 00:32:31.040
<v Speaker 2>I've helped them develop their careers like mad,</v>

747
00:32:31.041 --> 00:32:31.760
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

748
00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.590
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of these were high achieving women,</v>

749
00:32:33.591 --> 00:32:34.341
<v Speaker 2>but not all of them.</v>

750
00:32:34.341 --> 00:32:36.350
<v Speaker 2>Some of them were struggling along at the bottom.</v>

751
00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:41.210
<v Speaker 2>We spend hours and hours all the time out how to strategize so they could move</v>

752
00:32:41.211 --> 00:32:46.190
<v Speaker 2>themselves forward in their relationships and when they're in their careers,</v>

753
00:32:46.191 --> 00:32:47.240
<v Speaker 2>in your education.</v>

754
00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:49.880
<v Speaker 2>So the idea that I'm a misogynist,</v>

755
00:32:49.881 --> 00:32:50.714
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

756
00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:50.931
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

757
00:32:50.931 --> 00:32:51.710
<v Speaker 2>whatever you,</v>

758
00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:54.800
<v Speaker 2>you have your opinion about it and you have your reasons.</v>

759
00:32:54.801 --> 00:32:55.970
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

760
00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:02.120
<v Speaker 2>the fact that I'm helping men develop their competence hardly makes me an enemy</v>

761
00:33:02.121 --> 00:33:06.950
<v Speaker 2>of women unless the woman who think that are so clueless that they think that</v>

762
00:33:06.951 --> 00:33:07.710
<v Speaker 2>they would benefit</v>

763
00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:09.930
<v Speaker 1>by having more weak men in the world.</v>

764
00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:11.280
<v Speaker 1>And some people think that,</v>

765
00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:12.600
<v Speaker 1>but it's foolish.</v>

766
00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:14.380
<v Speaker 1>Last question on that for,</v>

767
00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:16.290
<v Speaker 1>I watched the followup interview in Amsterdam.</v>

768
00:33:16.291 --> 00:33:17.124
<v Speaker 1>I think it wasn't,</v>

769
00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:19.740
<v Speaker 1>you obviously had decompressed a bit from the interview,</v>

770
00:33:19.741 --> 00:33:24.210
<v Speaker 1>which was shortly before that and you said you felt somewhat bad that you did</v>

771
00:33:24.211 --> 00:33:27.180
<v Speaker 1>the Gotcha moment further away from this.</v>

772
00:33:27.181 --> 00:33:27.391
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

773
00:33:27.391 --> 00:33:29.040
<v Speaker 1>a couple of weeks now in retrospect,</v>

774
00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:32.040
<v Speaker 1>would you have said anything differently in that interview with her?</v>

775
00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:33.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

776
00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:34.610
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

777
00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:39.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm not unhappy with the interview and the idea with the Garcia was,</v>

778
00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:40.090
<v Speaker 2>I was making a joke,</v>

779
00:33:40.091 --> 00:33:40.331
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

780
00:33:40.331 --> 00:33:41.170
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>

781
00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:42.790
<v Speaker 2>it was a wild time joking.</v>

782
00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:43.270
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

783
00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:45.030
<v Speaker 2>there's utility in the Joel Comm.</v>

784
00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:49.840
<v Speaker 2>One of my friends pointed out that I could have used that as an opening to</v>

785
00:33:49.841 --> 00:33:51.850
<v Speaker 2>starting a more detailed conversation,</v>

786
00:33:51.851 --> 00:33:53.170
<v Speaker 2>a more serious conversation,</v>

787
00:33:53.171 --> 00:33:55.110
<v Speaker 2>but we were pressed for time.</v>

788
00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:56.770
<v Speaker 2>The interview was almost over.</v>

789
00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:02.350
<v Speaker 2>It's useful to keep things to introduce some liberty where that's possible.</v>

790
00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:03.393
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

791
00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:06.100
<v Speaker 2>I think the interview went as well as I could have hoped.</v>

792
00:34:06.101 --> 00:34:06.610
<v Speaker 2>Porn.</v>

793
00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:07.510
<v Speaker 2>That's good enough.</v>

794
00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:08.040
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

795
00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:08.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

796
00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:10.990
<v Speaker 2>going over it with a fine tooth comb.</v>

797
00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:13.720
<v Speaker 2>I can think of things that I might've,</v>

798
00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:15.940
<v Speaker 2>what broaches I might've taken.</v>

799
00:34:15.941 --> 00:34:16.721
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't be different,</v>

800
00:34:16.721 --> 00:34:18.980
<v Speaker 2>but it isn't clear to me that that would have necessarily been</v>

801
00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:19.923
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

802
00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:22.780
<v Speaker 1>Does it surprise you they turned her into her a victim?</v>

803
00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:25.673
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

804
00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:26.543
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

805
00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:26.900
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

806
00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:28.590
<v Speaker 2>it was actually quite shocking to me.</v>

807
00:34:28.591 --> 00:34:28.901
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

808
00:34:28.901 --> 00:34:31.500
<v Speaker 2>It can begin with because it was so,</v>

809
00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:35.310
<v Speaker 2>it was so both predictable and preposterous.</v>

810
00:34:35.311 --> 00:34:35.701
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

811
00:34:35.701 --> 00:34:35.881
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

812
00:34:35.881 --> 00:34:36.900
<v Speaker 2>she's a public figure.</v>

813
00:34:36.901 --> 00:34:38.010
<v Speaker 2>She's hardly a victim.</v>

814
00:34:38.011 --> 00:34:38.770
<v Speaker 2>She's,</v>

815
00:34:38.770 --> 00:34:40.950
<v Speaker 2>it's not like she's without power or influence.</v>

816
00:34:40.951 --> 00:34:42.030
<v Speaker 2>She's got plenty of it.</v>

817
00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:45.060
<v Speaker 2>She's doing quite well financially too.</v>

818
00:34:45.061 --> 00:34:46.740
<v Speaker 2>I imagine them on most,</v>

819
00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:49.080
<v Speaker 2>on most dimensions of measurement.</v>

820
00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:50.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

821
00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:51.390
<v Speaker 2>but to try it out,</v>

822
00:34:51.391 --> 00:34:53.640
<v Speaker 2>that victim narrative so rapidly was,</v>

823
00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:53.821
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

824
00:34:53.821 --> 00:34:54.301
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

825
00:34:54.301 --> 00:34:55.950
<v Speaker 2>reprehensible and second of all,</v>

826
00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:57.810
<v Speaker 2>appallingly predictable.</v>

827
00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:00.960
<v Speaker 2>And it was quite shocking because when it first happened,</v>

828
00:35:00.961 --> 00:35:02.850
<v Speaker 2>about 20 newspapers carried,</v>

829
00:35:02.851 --> 00:35:04.440
<v Speaker 2>picked up the ball and ran with it,</v>

830
00:35:04.441 --> 00:35:05.274
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

831
00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:08.190
<v Speaker 2>mostly in Canada and in the UK,</v>

832
00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:12.510
<v Speaker 2>but then a counter narrative develop pretty rapidly.</v>

833
00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:13.921
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

834
00:35:13.921 --> 00:35:14.754
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

835
00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:16.201
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

836
00:35:16.201 --> 00:35:19.470
<v Speaker 2>it isn't clear that the victim narrative is the one that carried the day.</v>

837
00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:20.843
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

838
00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:23.011
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it,</v>

839
00:35:23.011 --> 00:35:24.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it carried the day,</v>

840
00:35:24.211 --> 00:35:26.280
<v Speaker 1>but it was certainly voiced out there.</v>

841
00:35:26.281 --> 00:35:27.114
<v Speaker 1>And you know what,</v>

842
00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:29.700
<v Speaker 1>what do they say when you have ink by the barrel?</v>

843
00:35:29.701 --> 00:35:31.050
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be the loudest ones.</v>

844
00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:32.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

845
00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:33.320
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

846
00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:34.153
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

847
00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:34.620
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

848
00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:34.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

849
00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:35.430
<v Speaker 1>last question.</v>

850
00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:35.521
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

851
00:35:35.521 --> 00:35:35.851
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

852
00:35:35.851 --> 00:35:36.990
<v Speaker 1>you're obviously a Canadian,</v>

853
00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:38.070
<v Speaker 1>but you have your</v>

854
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:39.780
<v Speaker 2>pulse on American politics.</v>

855
00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:42.750
<v Speaker 2>And Ricochet is a right of center site and community.</v>

856
00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:44.430
<v Speaker 2>In one of your speeches,</v>

857
00:35:44.431 --> 00:35:49.431
<v Speaker 2>you thought the vote for Trump was people basically just saying they had enough.</v>

858
00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:51.600
<v Speaker 2>Were you surprised by the election?</v>

859
00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:54.293
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

860
00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:58.440
<v Speaker 2>a month before that I was certain that Clinton was going to win.</v>

861
00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:01.800
<v Speaker 2>I was shocked by the election.</v>

862
00:36:01.801 --> 00:36:04.980
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is the Americans that mean split 50,</v>

863
00:36:04.981 --> 00:36:06.810
<v Speaker 2>50 for about 15 years.</v>

864
00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:07.860
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

865
00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:09.500
<v Speaker 2>and it was really no different than that.</v>

866
00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:13.170
<v Speaker 2>The split between the population is so close that,</v>

867
00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:13.771
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

868
00:36:13.771 --> 00:36:16.680
<v Speaker 2>minor perturbations can throw it one way or another.</v>

869
00:36:16.681 --> 00:36:21.681
<v Speaker 2>And I do think that identity politics was one of the factors that elected Trump</v>

870
00:36:22.351 --> 00:36:23.790
<v Speaker 2>people had just had enough of it.</v>

871
00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:29.130
<v Speaker 2>So I guess I was surprised because I didn't regard Trump as a particularly</v>

872
00:36:29.131 --> 00:36:29.964
<v Speaker 2>credible,</v>

873
00:36:30.810 --> 00:36:31.410
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

874
00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:32.490
<v Speaker 2>potential leader.</v>

875
00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:33.600
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

876
00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:33.871
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

877
00:36:33.871 --> 00:36:35.970
<v Speaker 2>it's not like I was alone in that estimation,</v>

878
00:36:35.971 --> 00:36:36.804
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

879
00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:37.201
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

880
00:36:37.201 --> 00:36:38.034
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

881
00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:39.270
<v Speaker 2>I guess people,</v>

882
00:36:39.271 --> 00:36:43.510
<v Speaker 2>I think people decided they preferred the impulsive lies of Trump to the</v>

883
00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:45.210
<v Speaker 2>calculated lies of Clinton.</v>

884
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:49.080
<v Speaker 2>You need more honest lies.</v>

885
00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:50.483
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>

886
00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:54.090
<v Speaker 2>what are your thoughts thus far?</v>

887
00:36:55.090 --> 00:36:55.923
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

888
00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:58.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm refraining from judging.</v>

889
00:36:59.400 --> 00:36:59.700
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

890
00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:00.540
<v Speaker 2>North Korea.</v>

891
00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:04.560
<v Speaker 2>So look good for the good and the world hasn't fallen apart.</v>

892
00:37:04.561 --> 00:37:06.750
<v Speaker 2>So I'm always amazed when not hasn't happened.</v>

893
00:37:06.751 --> 00:37:08.880
<v Speaker 2>So hopefully that will continue.</v>

894
00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:09.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

895
00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:10.683
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

896
00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:11.101
<v Speaker 2>that's good.</v>

897
00:37:11.101 --> 00:37:11.481
<v Speaker 2>Go.</v>

898
00:37:11.481 --> 00:37:12.314

899

903
00:37:21.361 --> 00:37:21.961
<v Speaker 2>It's been a treat.</v>
