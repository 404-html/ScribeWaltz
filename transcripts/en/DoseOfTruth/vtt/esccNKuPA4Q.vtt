00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.930
<v Speaker 1>Dr Gears and thanks for continuing this series,</v>

2
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.130
<v Speaker 1>even as atheists appreciate the interaction and the,</v>

3
00:00:22.131 --> 00:00:22.964
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.190
<v Speaker 1>the conversation.</v>

5
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.820
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to ask you something that is both emotional and analytical because</v>

6
00:00:31.551 --> 00:00:34.430
<v Speaker 1>oftentimes you're basically pigged,</v>

7
00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.343
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

8
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.491
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9
00:00:36.491 --> 00:00:38.120
<v Speaker 1>seeing things very analytically.</v>

10
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.610
<v Speaker 1>So you were talking earlier about,</v>

11
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.473
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

12
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.780
<v Speaker 1>you were talking about the,</v>

13
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:44.170
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

14
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.003
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

15
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.920
<v Speaker 1>the juxtaposition between happiness and,</v>

16
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.843
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

17
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:51.800
<v Speaker 1>honor,</v>

19
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.200
<v Speaker 1>even though I don't think they're mutually exclusive personally,</v>

20
00:00:54.201 --> 00:00:57.080
<v Speaker 1>but if there's a situation,</v>

21
00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.651
<v Speaker 1>let's say we're,</v>

22
00:00:57.651 --> 00:01:02.651
<v Speaker 1>someone is truly in love with someone else and they loved them for many years</v>

23
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.710
<v Speaker 1>and decades.</v>

24
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.190
<v Speaker 1>They have a whole history together and then someone,</v>

25
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.190
<v Speaker 1>and then one of the people in this grouping,</v>

26
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.473
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

27
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.000
<v Speaker 1>start falling in love with someone else.</v>

28
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.880
<v Speaker 1>So it's not that there's less love for the original partner.</v>

29
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.840
<v Speaker 1>How analytically and emotionally do you,</v>

30
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

31
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.950
<v Speaker 1>take care of a situation like that when you feel that you want to stay honorable</v>

32
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.730
<v Speaker 1>and be happy?</v>

33
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:33.181
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

34
00:01:33.181 --> 00:01:36.330
<v Speaker 2>So the first thing I would say is the devil's always in the details,</v>

35
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.351
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

36
00:01:37.351 --> 00:01:42.351
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things that I'm not happy about with much modern moral theorizing</v>

37
00:01:44.371 --> 00:01:47.610
<v Speaker 2>is that it takes a story like that,</v>

38
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

39
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.940
<v Speaker 2>and then tries to extract out of general moral principle.</v>

40
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.970
<v Speaker 2>And often that's impossible because the particulars of the situation are very</v>

41
00:01:56.311 --> 00:01:57.144
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

42
00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:58.980
<v Speaker 2>But having said that,</v>

43
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:00.301
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

44
00:02:00.301 --> 00:02:01.800
<v Speaker 2>so let me think about that for a minute.</v>

45
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure that it's possible to be honorable in a situation like that because</v>

46
00:02:07.051 --> 00:02:12.051
<v Speaker 2>I think that you've acted out the violation already and having acted out the</v>

47
00:02:12.511 --> 00:02:16.080
<v Speaker 2>violation to confess it might be the right thing to do,</v>

48
00:02:16.081 --> 00:02:17.580
<v Speaker 2>although perhaps not,</v>

49
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.601
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

50
00:02:18.601 --> 00:02:19.480
<v Speaker 2>because if you,</v>

51
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.100
<v Speaker 2>it isn't obvious to me that if you'd be traced someone then you get to have the</v>

52
00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:24.420
<v Speaker 2>right to tell them about it.</v>

53
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.830
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

54
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:26.340
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

55
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.001
<v Speaker 2>I know you're not,</v>

56
00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:27.870
<v Speaker 2>I understand that.</v>

57
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

58
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:29.060
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

59
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.550
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

60
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.510
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>

61
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.373
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>

62
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.633
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

63
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.220
<v Speaker 2>my observation has been that if there's a tight relationship and if one party</v>

64
00:02:40.681 --> 00:02:42.510
<v Speaker 2>has betrayed by the other in that manner,</v>

65
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.450
<v Speaker 2>that it's almost always irreconcilable.</v>

66
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.210
<v Speaker 2>It breaks it and all right.</v>

67
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.441
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

68
00:02:49.441 --> 00:02:49.740
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

69
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.980
<v Speaker 2>I've helped people try to struggle through that bolt on both sides of it.</v>

70
00:02:52.981 --> 00:02:56.190
<v Speaker 2>The person who was betrayed and the person who did the betrayal.</v>

71
00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:57.420
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

72
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 2>I've seen people grow up and not do it again.</v>

73
00:03:00.071 --> 00:03:02.740
<v Speaker 2>And this was in situations where their partner didn't know.</v>

74
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.170
<v Speaker 2>And in a couple of those situations,</v>

75
00:03:05.171 --> 00:03:09.760
<v Speaker 2>it seemed to me that it might've even been unnecessary learning experience for</v>

76
00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:10.930
<v Speaker 2>the person who did it.</v>

77
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.471
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

78
00:03:11.471 --> 00:03:11.640
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

79
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.380
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

80
00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.690
<v Speaker 2>it helped them develop.</v>

81
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.600
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean I'm justifying it,</v>

82
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.670
<v Speaker 2>but life is complicated.</v>

83
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:19.803
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

84
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.020
<v Speaker 2>but I think that society works better.</v>

85
00:03:25.021 --> 00:03:29.640
<v Speaker 2>All things considered when you make a promise and you stick to it.</v>

86
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.940
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things I learned from reading young,</v>

87
00:03:32.941 --> 00:03:33.270
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

88
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.930
<v Speaker 2>which I really liked was [inaudible].</v>

89
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:36.440
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

90
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.810
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

91
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.200
<v Speaker 2>he believed that he had his affairs too.</v>

92
00:03:40.201 --> 00:03:42.690
<v Speaker 2>So you might think about it as somewhat hypocritical,</v>

93
00:03:42.691 --> 00:03:43.524
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

94
00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.090
<v Speaker 2>but I think that people can make mistakes without having what they think</v>

95
00:03:48.091 --> 00:03:49.380
<v Speaker 2>necessarily be wrong.</v>

96
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:50.490
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

97
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.180
<v Speaker 2>he said that there were things in a marriage that you can't have unless you're</v>

98
00:03:54.181 --> 00:03:55.014
<v Speaker 2>all in.</v>

99
00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:56.790
<v Speaker 2>And I believe that.</v>

100
00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.930
<v Speaker 2>I believe that.</v>

101
00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.130
<v Speaker 2>And so if there's a back door open or like to begin with,</v>

102
00:04:02.131 --> 00:04:03.540
<v Speaker 2>or a backdoor opens,</v>

103
00:04:03.541 --> 00:04:07.590
<v Speaker 2>then I think that there's something about the relationship that is lacking at</v>

104
00:04:07.591 --> 00:04:08.011
<v Speaker 2>least,</v>

105
00:04:08.011 --> 00:04:10.140
<v Speaker 2>and I think you pay a big price for that.</v>

106
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.641
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>

107
00:04:11.641 --> 00:04:16.641
<v Speaker 2>it depends on whether you regard a marriage as a practical arrangement or a</v>

108
00:04:16.921 --> 00:04:18.030
<v Speaker 2>spiritual arrangement.</v>

109
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.350
<v Speaker 2>Now really it's both,</v>

110
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

111
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.150
<v Speaker 2>both are important,</v>

112
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.800
<v Speaker 2>but if it's a spiritual arrangement or a psychological arrangement above all,</v>

113
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.720
<v Speaker 2>then I do think that</v>

114
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.370
<v Speaker 2>you don't get the transformation without being all in.</v>

115
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.510
<v Speaker 2>And if you violate it,</v>

116
00:04:33.511 --> 00:04:36.270
<v Speaker 2>then even if you can work it out with your partner,</v>

117
00:04:36.271 --> 00:04:40.230
<v Speaker 2>there's something that you will never get as a consequence.</v>
