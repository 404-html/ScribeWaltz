1
00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:07.340
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.861
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

3
00:00:07.861 --> 00:00:10.140
<v Speaker 1>What the hell address the Jewish question?</v>

4
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.790
<v Speaker 1>That's a hell of a thing to ask.</v>

5
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.200
<v Speaker 1>So that's Jacqueline turn,</v>

6
00:00:13.201 --> 00:00:13.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean really that's a hell of a thing to ask,</v>

8
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.190
<v Speaker 1>but I will say something about it.</v>

9
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

10
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.740
<v Speaker 1>and I've thought about this a lot.</v>

11
00:00:19.741 --> 00:00:23.040
<v Speaker 1>So there is evidence that Ashkenazi Jews,</v>

12
00:00:23.041 --> 00:00:24.960
<v Speaker 1>so those are Jews of European heritage,</v>

13
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.650
<v Speaker 1>have iqs that are about 15 points higher than the population average.</v>

14
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.240
<v Speaker 1>So that's a lot 15 points.</v>

15
00:00:30.241 --> 00:00:33.270
<v Speaker 1>It's about the average difference between the typical high school student and</v>

16
00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:34.800
<v Speaker 1>the typical state college student.</v>

17
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:35.783
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot.</v>

18
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.920
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that means is,</v>

19
00:00:37.921 --> 00:00:41.460
<v Speaker 1>so imagine there's two distributions and that they overlap and that the Jewish</v>

20
00:00:41.461 --> 00:00:42.294
<v Speaker 1>one is,</v>

21
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.223
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

22
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.290
<v Speaker 1>is the mean is as one 15 so the whole distribution has shifted to the right.</v>

23
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.440
<v Speaker 1>What that means is if you go up into the Higher Iq strata one 31 45 way the hell</v>

24
00:00:54.991 --> 00:00:55.740
<v Speaker 1>up there,</v>

25
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.490
<v Speaker 1>that Jewish people are overwhelmingly overrepresented at the high end of the</v>

26
00:00:59.491 --> 00:01:00.480
<v Speaker 1>Eicu distribution.</v>

27
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.890
<v Speaker 1>Now the price they pay for that is some increased propensity for neurological</v>

28
00:01:04.891 --> 00:01:05.491
<v Speaker 1>diseases.</v>

29
00:01:05.491 --> 00:01:08.630
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be associated in some sense with that heightened Iq.</v>

30
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:09.480
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

31
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.721
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:01:09.721 --> 00:01:11.490
<v Speaker 1>the science on this isn't settled but,</v>

33
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.510
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>

34
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.120
<v Speaker 1>it's reasonably solid.</v>

35
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.200
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

36
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.480
<v Speaker 1>it'll given the standards of such things.</v>

37
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:18.991
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

38
00:01:18.991 --> 00:01:23.991
<v Speaker 1>so Jews are going to be over represented at the high end of cognitively complex</v>

39
00:01:24.511 --> 00:01:25.344
<v Speaker 1>disciplines.</v>

40
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.580
<v Speaker 1>So then I would say,</v>

41
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.870
<v Speaker 1>and that's the case,</v>

42
00:01:27.871 --> 00:01:31.560
<v Speaker 1>like they're way overrepresented among like outstanding scientists and among</v>

43
00:01:31.561 --> 00:01:33.840
<v Speaker 1>Nobel prize winners and so forth.</v>

44
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.430
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>

45
00:01:35.431 --> 00:01:36.510
<v Speaker 1>people look and they think,</v>

46
00:01:36.511 --> 00:01:40.770
<v Speaker 1>well why are there a disproportionate number of Jewish people in positions of</v>

47
00:01:40.771 --> 00:01:41.161
<v Speaker 1>authority?</v>

48
00:01:41.161 --> 00:01:41.491
<v Speaker 1>And they say,</v>

49
00:01:41.491 --> 00:01:41.671
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

50
00:01:41.671 --> 00:01:43.230
<v Speaker 1>it must be a conspiracy.</v>

51
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.011
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

52
00:01:44.011 --> 00:01:46.260
<v Speaker 1>it must be systemic in some sense.</v>

53
00:01:46.261 --> 00:01:46.591
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

54
00:01:46.591 --> 00:01:47.160
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

55
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.360
<v Speaker 1>it can be simply accounted for by that relatively large Iq differential.</v>

56
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.850
<v Speaker 1>Now the next criticism would be,</v>

57
00:01:53.851 --> 00:01:54.540
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

58
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.730
<v Speaker 1>don't the Jews tend to lean left?</v>

59
00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.080
<v Speaker 1>Well first you might say,</v>

60
00:01:58.081 --> 00:01:58.620
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

61
00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

62
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.950
<v Speaker 1>given what happened in Nazi Germany to the degree that that was right wing as we</v>

63
00:02:03.961 --> 00:02:04.771
<v Speaker 1>discussed earlier,</v>

64
00:02:04.771 --> 00:02:06.720
<v Speaker 1>that's the nationalism and ethnocentrism.</v>

65
00:02:06.721 --> 00:02:09.030
<v Speaker 1>It's hardly surprising that they might,</v>

66
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:09.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

67
00:02:09.691 --> 00:02:13.380
<v Speaker 1>in this historical period of time tend to move towards the left.</v>

68
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.000
<v Speaker 1>But more importantly than that,</v>

69
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.370
<v Speaker 1>I queue is associated with trait openness and trade openness is a strong</v>

70
00:02:20.371 --> 00:02:22.860
<v Speaker 1>predictor predictor of political liberalism.</v>

71
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.233
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

72
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.820
<v Speaker 1>and it's the strongest predictor of political liberalism.</v>

73
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.350
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

74
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.570
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult.</v>

75
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.250
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I have to say about that.</v>

76
00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:32.611
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

77
00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:33.930
<v Speaker 1>and the other thing I would say is,</v>

78
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

79
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.930
<v Speaker 1>the fact that there's a population is subpopulation of people who are much</v>

80
00:02:39.931 --> 00:02:41.190
<v Speaker 1>smarter than average,</v>

81
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.300
<v Speaker 1>not on average,</v>

82
00:02:42.301 --> 00:02:42.750
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

83
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:43.540
<v Speaker 1>On average,</v>

84
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.970
<v Speaker 1>I've got to get that straight on average is actually of great benefit to the</v>

85
00:02:47.971 --> 00:02:49.860
<v Speaker 1>rest of us because what do you want?</v>

86
00:02:49.861 --> 00:02:51.060
<v Speaker 1>Fewer geniuses,</v>

87
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.590
<v Speaker 1>fewer people with Iqs of 145 or 160 that's,</v>

88
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:56.790
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

89
00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.520
<v Speaker 1>and it's no conspiracy that people who are smarter,</v>

90
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.360
<v Speaker 1>higher up in competence hierarchies because accused the best predictor of</v>

91
00:03:04.361 --> 00:03:07.420
<v Speaker 1>movement up in a complex car competence hierarchy.</v>

92
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:08.800
<v Speaker 1>So there,</v>

93
00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:10.360
<v Speaker 1>I've addressed the Jewish question.</v>

94
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.510
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's a confusion between ethnicity and and Iq as far as I'm concerned.</v>

95
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.620
<v Speaker 1>So I'll probably get like painted six different shades of black for that answer.</v>

96
00:03:20.621 --> 00:03:21.454
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

97
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:22.840
<v Speaker 1>I've thought about a long time.</v>

98
00:03:22.841 --> 00:03:24.580
<v Speaker 1>It's the best that I can manage.</v>
