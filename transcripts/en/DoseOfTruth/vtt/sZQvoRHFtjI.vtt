<v Speaker 1>Daniel,</v>

2
00:00:10.181 --> 00:00:13.090
<v Speaker 1>how to be a good partner to someone suffering from depression.</v>

3
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:14.471
<v Speaker 1>That's a tough one,</v>

4
00:00:14.471 --> 00:00:15.280
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

5
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.980
<v Speaker 1>It's very hard to live with someone who's suffering from depression.</v>

6
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.670
<v Speaker 1>We are helping without enabling and pushing without being too judgmental.</v>

7
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:23.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

8
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.681
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

9
00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:24.910
<v Speaker 1>the devil's in the details.</v>

10
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.140
<v Speaker 1>Is the person seeing a counselor because if they're depressed,</v>

11
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.700
<v Speaker 1>then they need to talk to someone.</v>

12
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.470
<v Speaker 1>Have they tried antidepressants?</v>

13
00:00:32.471 --> 00:00:33.670
<v Speaker 1>Because if they're depressed,</v>

14
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.380
<v Speaker 1>they should try antidepressants.</v>

15
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:38.903
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

16
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.640
<v Speaker 1>And they should be strongly encouraged to do so.</v>

17
00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:45.570
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that encouragement should even border on a demand because depression</v>

18
00:00:45.571 --> 00:00:45.961
<v Speaker 1>is just,</v>

19
00:00:45.961 --> 00:00:46.710
<v Speaker 1>it's terrible.</v>

20
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.750
<v Speaker 1>It's terrible for the person who's experiencing it,</v>

21
00:00:48.751 --> 00:00:50.250
<v Speaker 1>like unalterably terrible.</v>

22
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.593
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

23
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.080
<v Speaker 1>and it's terrible for the person who is living with the person who has</v>

24
00:00:58.081 --> 00:00:58.621
<v Speaker 1>depression.</v>

25
00:00:58.621 --> 00:01:02.670
<v Speaker 1>And so it's incumbent on the person who has depression to do everything they</v>

26
00:01:02.671 --> 00:01:06.690
<v Speaker 1>possibly can in order to set it straight.</v>

27
00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:07.351
<v Speaker 1>And it's hard.</v>

28
00:01:07.351 --> 00:01:08.070
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

29
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.550
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of potential treatments for depression that have some efficacy in</v>

30
00:01:11.551 --> 00:01:12.301
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants.</v>

31
00:01:12.301 --> 00:01:14.010
<v Speaker 1>Really do work wonders on people.</v>

32
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.380
<v Speaker 1>You could try five hydroxy tryptamine too.</v>

33
00:01:16.381 --> 00:01:17.131
<v Speaker 1>You could look that up.</v>

34
00:01:17.131 --> 00:01:18.420
<v Speaker 1>Five HTP,</v>

35
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.970
<v Speaker 1>it's usually three times a hundred milligrams.</v>

36
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.090
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

37
00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.561
<v Speaker 1>and you can,</v>

38
00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:23.371
<v Speaker 1>if you try that,</v>

39
00:01:23.371 --> 00:01:26.670
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you can find out if antidepressants will work for you without having</v>

40
00:01:26.671 --> 00:01:28.950
<v Speaker 1>to resort to the antidepressants themselves.</v>

41
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

42
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.390
<v Speaker 1>you can also help the depressed person make a plan in the morning.</v>

43
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.170
<v Speaker 1>That can be really useful or maybe a plan the night before if they're just not</v>

44
00:01:37.171 --> 00:01:38.430
<v Speaker 1>in any shape to do it in the morning,</v>

45
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.480
<v Speaker 1>to sit down and say,</v>

46
00:01:39.481 --> 00:01:39.811
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

47
00:01:39.811 --> 00:01:41.970
<v Speaker 1>well you have to get through tomorrow.</v>

48
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.830
<v Speaker 1>And that's another good,</v>

49
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.290
<v Speaker 1>that's another good piece of advice.</v>

50
00:01:46.291 --> 00:01:48.960
<v Speaker 1>And so in rule 12,</v>

51
00:01:48.961 --> 00:01:52.500
<v Speaker 1>I talk about that sometimes in relationship to depression,</v>

52
00:01:52.501 --> 00:01:55.230
<v Speaker 1>real 12 is pet a cat when you encounter one on the street.</v>

53
00:01:55.231 --> 00:01:58.410
<v Speaker 1>And it's a bit of a meditation about what to do when your life is in absolute</v>

54
00:01:58.411 --> 00:01:59.220
<v Speaker 1>crisis.</v>

55
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.630
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things you can do with someone who's depressed is narrow.</v>

56
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.470
<v Speaker 1>And this is what I discuss in this chapter is narrow their timeframe.</v>

57
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:08.071
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

58
00:02:08.071 --> 00:02:10.710
<v Speaker 1>maybe a depressed person can't think a week ahead,</v>

59
00:02:10.711 --> 00:02:13.770
<v Speaker 1>but maybe they can think about tomorrow and you can sit down and say,</v>

60
00:02:13.771 --> 00:02:14.041
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

61
00:02:14.041 --> 00:02:15.390
<v Speaker 1>well you have to get through tomorrow.</v>

62
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.690
<v Speaker 1>And so how are we going to structure tomorrow so that it will be okay and so</v>

63
00:02:18.691 --> 00:02:21.870
<v Speaker 1>that you'll be able to sleep reasonably soundly when you go to bed tomorrow</v>

64
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.871
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>

65
00:02:21.871 --> 00:02:24.090
<v Speaker 1>And then tomorrow night we'll do the same thing.</v>

66
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.000
<v Speaker 1>And helping someone come up with a daily plan can be,</v>

67
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.060
<v Speaker 1>now they might object and squawk and complain about it,</v>

68
00:02:30.061 --> 00:02:31.200
<v Speaker 1>but you should be.</v>

69
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

70
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.080
<v Speaker 1>I would say relatively persistent about that.</v>

71
00:02:34.081 --> 00:02:34.591
<v Speaker 1>And you can say,</v>

72
00:02:34.591 --> 00:02:34.861
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

73
00:02:34.861 --> 00:02:36.330
<v Speaker 1>let's just try it for a week.</v>

74
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.500
<v Speaker 1>And if they say no,</v>

75
00:02:37.501 --> 00:02:37.951
<v Speaker 1>then you say,</v>

76
00:02:37.951 --> 00:02:38.071
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

77
00:02:38.071 --> 00:02:39.780
<v Speaker 1>let's try it for one day.</v>

78
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

79
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:41.220
<v Speaker 1>Christ,</v>

80
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.230
<v Speaker 1>the person's got to be pretty unreasonable if they,</v>

81
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.870
<v Speaker 1>let's plan for 10 minutes just for tomorrow,</v>

82
00:02:45.871 --> 00:02:47.040
<v Speaker 1>and see if that's helpful.</v>

83
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

84
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.720
<v Speaker 1>if the person objects,</v>

85
00:02:48.721 --> 00:02:52.650
<v Speaker 1>you can keep cutting the magnitude of what you're asking down until you finally</v>

86
00:02:52.651 --> 00:02:53.484
<v Speaker 1>get a bit of a,</v>

87
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.290
<v Speaker 1>a bit of an agreement from them.</v>

88
00:02:55.291 --> 00:02:57.840
<v Speaker 1>But helping someone depressed plan can help a lot.</v>
