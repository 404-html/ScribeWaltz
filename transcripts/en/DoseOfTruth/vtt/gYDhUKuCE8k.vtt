1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:00.321
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:00.321 --> 00:00:00.670
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3
00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:00.860
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

4
00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:01.131
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

5
00:00:01.131 --> 00:00:04.180
<v Speaker 1>so there is something we could talk about for a minute because you know,</v>

6
00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.790
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

7
00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:05.623
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.580
<v Speaker 1>there's political,</v>

9
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.780
<v Speaker 1>what do you call rumblings about the fact that I think a lot of this is</v>

10
00:00:11.781 --> 00:00:14.180
<v Speaker 1>generated by the radical left types,</v>

11
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.900
<v Speaker 1>particularly on the campuses,</v>

12
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.980
<v Speaker 1>but the system is rigged and that it's an oppressive patriarchy.</v>

13
00:00:18.981 --> 00:00:22.670
<v Speaker 1>And that the reason that people are at the top is because they played power</v>

14
00:00:22.671 --> 00:00:23.121
<v Speaker 1>games.</v>

15
00:00:23.121 --> 00:00:23.781
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

16
00:00:23.781 --> 00:00:24.614
<v Speaker 1>it's this,</v>

17
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.890
<v Speaker 1>my sense is that the control is that we're,</v>

18
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.050
<v Speaker 1>we're ethnic or racial or gender groups and we're competing in the Marxists</v>

19
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.790
<v Speaker 1>manner and those who win have one because of oppression.</v>

20
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.030
<v Speaker 1>But I know the literature on the relationship between individuals,</v>

21
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.060
<v Speaker 1>individual differences and longterm life success in the Western world and the</v>

22
00:00:44.061 --> 00:00:45.530
<v Speaker 1>literature is actually very clear.</v>

23
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.920
<v Speaker 1>So intelligence seems to account for about 20% of the variants in longterm life</v>

24
00:00:51.141 --> 00:00:51.974
<v Speaker 1>success.</v>

25
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.370
<v Speaker 1>And then trait conscientiousness accounts for perhaps another,</v>

26
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.440
<v Speaker 1>maybe 10 to 15%.</v>

27
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.190
<v Speaker 1>And then there's smaller contributions of emotional stability,</v>

28
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.270
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

29
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.130
<v Speaker 1>and also have trait openness,</v>

30
00:01:04.131 --> 00:01:06.510
<v Speaker 1>which seems to be a good predictor of entrepreneurial ability.</v>

31
00:01:06.511 --> 00:01:11.511
<v Speaker 1>So it looks like in the West that you can attribute about 40 to 50% of the</v>

32
00:01:11.541 --> 00:01:12.320
<v Speaker 1>variants.</v>

33
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.340
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's a little high,</v>

34
00:01:13.341 --> 00:01:13.700
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

35
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.330
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

36
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.500
<v Speaker 1>it's not a radical over estimate to the sorts of individual differences that are</v>

37
00:01:18.501 --> 00:01:23.150
<v Speaker 1>associated with productivity because increases in Iq hierarchy you at higher</v>

38
00:01:23.151 --> 00:01:25.670
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness definitely make people more productive.</v>

39
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.720
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me that you can use that as an index of the,</v>

40
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.143
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

41
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.760
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>

42
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.260
<v Speaker 1>of the genuinely meritocratic nature of a culture and also as an index of its</v>

43
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.630
<v Speaker 1>willingness to engage in fair play because you'd expect if it,</v>

44
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.840
<v Speaker 1>if your culture is aimed at productivity and it turns out that those are the</v>

45
00:01:44.841 --> 00:01:48.650
<v Speaker 1>most PR and it turns out that the most productive people are in fact</v>

46
00:01:48.651 --> 00:01:49.910
<v Speaker 1>differentially rewarded.</v>

47
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.860
<v Speaker 1>That seems to me to be a reasonable index of the success of this society now</v>

48
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.360
<v Speaker 1>that that is still leaves 50 to 60% of the variance on explained.</v>

49
00:01:59.361 --> 00:02:00.194
<v Speaker 1>And so you can,</v>

50
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.210
<v Speaker 1>in there you could include racism and prejudice and the tyranny of the system</v>

51
00:02:05.211 --> 00:02:09.740
<v Speaker 1>and blind luck can physical health and all of the arbitrary and random events</v>

52
00:02:09.741 --> 00:02:13.730
<v Speaker 1>that make up that determined whether someone is successful or fails in life.</v>

53
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.560
<v Speaker 1>But it does seem to me to provide a metric saying that not only is our society</v>

54
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.390
<v Speaker 1>crazily productive and reasonably and reasonably good at district distributing</v>

55
00:02:23.391 --> 00:02:23.991
<v Speaker 1>the spoils,</v>

56
00:02:23.991 --> 00:02:25.550
<v Speaker 1>even though there's still some inequality,</v>

57
00:02:25.551 --> 00:02:29.780
<v Speaker 1>but a fair bit of inequality is actually generated as a consequence of</v>

58
00:02:29.781 --> 00:02:33.290
<v Speaker 1>differences in genuine productivity that seem reasonable to you.</v>

59
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

60
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.330
<v Speaker 2>maybe it ought to be obvious and,</v>

61
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.821
<v Speaker 2>but now,</v>

62
00:02:37.821 --> 00:02:40.450
<v Speaker 2>except for the fact that in a lot of intellectual life,</v>

63
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.040
<v Speaker 2>the assumption is that the correlation between a psychological traits and</v>

64
00:02:45.041 --> 00:02:45.940
<v Speaker 2>success is zero.</v>

65
00:02:45.941 --> 00:02:46.870
<v Speaker 2>So the fact that it's,</v>

66
00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

67
00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:48.640
<v Speaker 2>let's say it's 40%,</v>

68
00:02:48.641 --> 00:02:53.260
<v Speaker 2>I think it says 33% I bet a lot higher than in most people are willing to</v>

69
00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:54.573
<v Speaker 2>acknowledge.</v>

70
00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.350
<v Speaker 2>And what you said is exactly right.</v>

71
00:02:56.351 --> 00:03:00.970
<v Speaker 2>That leaves more than half of the variance not to be correlating that with</v>

72
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:02.080
<v Speaker 2>individual differences.</v>

73
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.213
<v Speaker 2>And of course,</v>

74
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

75
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.550
<v Speaker 2>various inequities could go into that,</v>

76
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.230
<v Speaker 3>that got 50 or 60%.</v>

77
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:09.630
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

78
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:10.210
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>

79
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.043
<v Speaker 2>they're not mutually</v>

80
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.210
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

81
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.043
<v Speaker 3>it seems hard.</v>

82
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.320
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

83
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.830
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

84
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.580
<v Speaker 2>we know that there's a lot of gaming of the system particularly yeah.</v>

85
00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:18.970
<v Speaker 3>United States by,</v>

86
00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:19.820
<v Speaker 3>by the wealthy.</v>

87
00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.640
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

88
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.870
<v Speaker 2>and that should obviously be eliminated.</v>

89
00:03:22.871 --> 00:03:23.704
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

90
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.690
<v Speaker 3>not fair.</v>

91
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:25.360
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>

92
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.360
<v Speaker 2>If we could also ask another question is whether the rewards that go to the</v>

93
00:03:31.371 --> 00:03:36.320
<v Speaker 2>talented are necessarily in sectors that lead to what we might call a</v>

94
00:03:36.321 --> 00:03:37.790
<v Speaker 2>productivity in the sense of,</v>

95
00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:38.180
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

96
00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.930
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

97
00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.370
<v Speaker 2>increasing societal wealth.</v>

98
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.090
<v Speaker 2>And an argument can be made that there's some misallocation of intellectual</v>

99
00:03:44.091 --> 00:03:45.710
<v Speaker 2>resources that we have,</v>

100
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

101
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.880
<v Speaker 2>that the,</v>

102
00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:47.211
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

103
00:03:47.211 --> 00:03:47.930
<v Speaker 2>economy,</v>

104
00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:48.081
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

105
00:03:48.081 --> 00:03:48.441
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

106
00:03:48.441 --> 00:03:48.950
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

107
00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:49.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

108
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.520
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

109
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.420
<v Speaker 2>to driven by,</v>

110
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.070
<v Speaker 2>by finance that the,</v>

111
00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

112
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.750
<v Speaker 2>there are too many lawsuits.</v>

113
00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.940
<v Speaker 2>Legal system is each other.</v>

114
00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.331
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

115
00:03:56.331 --> 00:03:56.960
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

116
00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:57.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

117
00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.790
<v Speaker 2>our estimated by intellectuals,</v>

118
00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.650
<v Speaker 2>this does still leave a,</v>

119
00:04:00.651 --> 00:04:00.840
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

120
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.990
<v Speaker 2>a place for criticizing a number of the,</v>

121
00:04:02.991 --> 00:04:03.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

122
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

123
00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.540
<v Speaker 2>the reason which our economy is set up.</v>

124
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.120
<v Speaker 2>There's always scope for improvement.</v>

125
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.881
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

126
00:04:08.881 --> 00:04:13.881
<v Speaker 1>And we were talking about why despite the fact that a fair bit of the variance</v>

127
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.250
<v Speaker 1>or a third to half of the variance in,</v>

128
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.040
<v Speaker 1>in life success is taken up by let's say,</v>

129
00:04:20.041 --> 00:04:21.450
<v Speaker 1>individual attributes,</v>

130
00:04:21.451 --> 00:04:24.390
<v Speaker 1>there's still room for a systemic critique that's valid.</v>

131
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

132
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.230
<v Speaker 2>One of the pathologies of intellectual life that I wrote about it in the blank</v>

133
00:04:30.231 --> 00:04:34.010
<v Speaker 2>slate about denial of human nature was that,</v>

134
00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

135
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:35.830
<v Speaker 2>the in,</v>

136
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.480
<v Speaker 2>in polite company and the intellectual circles,</v>

137
00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.810
<v Speaker 2>the amount of light success determined by a inherent and largely heritable</v>

138
00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.160
<v Speaker 2>psychological traits has to be zero.</v>

139
00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean that just the,</v>

140
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:48.360
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

141
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.530
<v Speaker 2>the only acceptable position.</v>

142
00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.101
<v Speaker 2>And you,</v>

143
00:04:52.101 --> 00:04:53.480
<v Speaker 2>and I know it's not zero.</v>

144
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:54.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

145
00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.270
<v Speaker 1>so let me interject for one second.</v>

146
00:04:56.271 --> 00:04:57.104
<v Speaker 1>I'm also,</v>

147
00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.950
<v Speaker 1>there's a fairness element there.</v>

148
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.300
<v Speaker 1>But the other thing is,</v>

149
00:05:00.301 --> 00:05:03.510
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that that's extraordinary self serving of people too.</v>

150
00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:04.540
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>

151
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.350
<v Speaker 1>if you get together with a group of Harvard professors,</v>

152
00:05:07.351 --> 00:05:08.184
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

153
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:09.210
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

154
00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.170
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty obvious that their innate intelligence is one of the factors that</v>

155
00:05:13.171 --> 00:05:14.400
<v Speaker 1>determine their success.</v>

156
00:05:14.401 --> 00:05:19.401
<v Speaker 1>And to deny the fact that heritable differences make a difference means perhaps</v>

157
00:05:19.951 --> 00:05:24.780
<v Speaker 1>to act as an Avatar of a social justice orientation,</v>

158
00:05:24.781 --> 00:05:27.060
<v Speaker 1>but equally to deny the role of,</v>

159
00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.830
<v Speaker 1>of the benefits of Champs in your own success and to their,</v>

160
00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:36.000
<v Speaker 1>for lack a certain degree of humility that you might otherwise be required to</v>

161
00:05:36.001 --> 00:05:36.834
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

162
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.130
<v Speaker 1>So it's not all,</v>

163
00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.790
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not claiming that you were implying this at all,</v>

164
00:05:41.791 --> 00:05:46.791
<v Speaker 1>but it's not all in the service of higher social ideals that people denied they,</v>

165
00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.230
<v Speaker 1>the contribution of,</v>

166
00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.240
<v Speaker 1>of heritable components,</v>

167
00:05:51.241 --> 00:05:52.074
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

168
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.100
<v Speaker 1>the birth laundry.</v>

169
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:54.383
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

170
00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.860
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

171
00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:56.330
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

172
00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.601
<v Speaker 1>Whoops.</v>

173
00:05:56.601 --> 00:05:57.434
<v Speaker 1>We just,</v>

174
00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.973
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

175
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:04.220
<v Speaker 2>I unfortunately the video just froze and after you said,</v>

176
00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:06.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying you claimed this,</v>

177
00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:06.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

178
00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.270
<v Speaker 2>you suddenly froze on the screen.</v>

179
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.430
<v Speaker 1>We're not saying you're claiming this.</v>

180
00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:12.970
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

181
00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:13.301
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

182
00:06:13.301 --> 00:06:13.960
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

183
00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.290
<v Speaker 1>it seems self serving for people who are particularly bright,</v>

184
00:06:17.291 --> 00:06:18.124
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

185
00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:23.430
<v Speaker 1>to not be grateful for the fact that they won the genetic lottery in that in</v>

186
00:06:24.011 --> 00:06:29.011
<v Speaker 1>that manner and insufficiently humble,</v>

187
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:30.800
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

188
00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:35.680
<v Speaker 1>to not know what the role of that arbitrary chance in determining their success.</v>

189
00:06:35.681 --> 00:06:38.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not like they don't deserve their success because of that,</v>

190
00:06:38.441 --> 00:06:42.500
<v Speaker 1>but claiming a certain degree of biological determinism,</v>

191
00:06:42.501 --> 00:06:47.140
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't necessarily make you a bad person even though it can be read that way</v>

192
00:06:47.141 --> 00:06:51.430
<v Speaker 1>because it makes you very sensitive to your own good fortune if you,</v>

193
00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.900
<v Speaker 1>if you think it through carefully.</v>

194
00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:54.870
<v Speaker 2>Oh absolutely.</v>

195
00:06:54.871 --> 00:06:55.321
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

196
00:06:55.321 --> 00:06:58.080
<v Speaker 2>successful people are the winners of at least three lotteries.</v>

197
00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.030
<v Speaker 2>One of them that you mentioned,</v>

198
00:07:00.031 --> 00:07:01.920
<v Speaker 2>of course it's the genetic lottery lottery.</v>

199
00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:06.120
<v Speaker 2>The fact that does that some people were born with greater intelligence and</v>

200
00:07:06.121 --> 00:07:08.520
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness and openness to experience.</v>

201
00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:13.970
<v Speaker 2>Another is that there's a a second lottery in a human development that is not</v>

202
00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.020
<v Speaker 2>strictly genetic,</v>

203
00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:19.680
<v Speaker 2>but it is in a sense constitutional or developmental.</v>

204
00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:24.570
<v Speaker 2>The fact that I might consider this one of the most profound discoveries in the</v>

205
00:07:24.571 --> 00:07:25.680
<v Speaker 2>history of psychology,</v>

206
00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:29.250
<v Speaker 2>that correlation is between identical twins reared together,</v>

207
00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:33.240
<v Speaker 2>are generally on the order of 0.5.</v>

208
00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:34.110
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

209
00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:36.420
<v Speaker 2>and they share not only their genome,</v>

210
00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:37.260
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

211
00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:37.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

212
00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.320
<v Speaker 2>the vast amount of their environments that their parents,</v>

213
00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:41.101
<v Speaker 2>their neighborhoods,</v>

214
00:07:41.101 --> 00:07:41.911
<v Speaker 2>they're older sibs.</v>

215
00:07:41.911 --> 00:07:42.840
<v Speaker 2>They're younger sibs,</v>

216
00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.340
<v Speaker 2>the number of books in the house,</v>

217
00:07:44.341 --> 00:07:45.420
<v Speaker 2>number of guns in the house,</v>

218
00:07:45.421 --> 00:07:46.710
<v Speaker 2>number of TVs in the house,</v>

219
00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.450
<v Speaker 2>yet they're not indistinguishable.</v>

220
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:52.350
<v Speaker 2>A identical twins are a correlate quite highly,</v>

221
00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:53.940
<v Speaker 2>but no one near perfectly,</v>

222
00:07:53.941 --> 00:07:58.710
<v Speaker 2>which means that there is a second lottery that has to do either with just the</v>

223
00:07:58.711 --> 00:07:59.170
<v Speaker 2>way the,</v>

224
00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:00.003
<v Speaker 2>the brain,</v>

225
00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:00.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

226
00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:02.160
<v Speaker 2>congeals during development,</v>

227
00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:05.850
<v Speaker 2>which can't be specified down to the last synapse by the genes.</v>

228
00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:06.600
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

229
00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.120
<v Speaker 2>and perhaps by chance life events,</v>

230
00:08:09.121 --> 00:08:14.121
<v Speaker 2>which might leave unpredictable traces that we can't add a documenter or</v>

231
00:08:14.371 --> 00:08:15.600
<v Speaker 2>systematically understand.</v>

232
00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:16.411
<v Speaker 2>And then of course,</v>

233
00:08:16.411 --> 00:08:17.940
<v Speaker 2>there's the third lottery of,</v>

234
00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:18.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

235
00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:22.590
<v Speaker 2>what happens to you in your profession.</v>

236
00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:25.230
<v Speaker 2>Did you bet on the right sector?</v>

237
00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:30.120
<v Speaker 2>Did you happen to have a good relationship with the boss?</v>

238
00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:31.643
<v Speaker 2>Numerous.</v>

239
00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:32.320
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

240
00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.100
<v Speaker 1>It's a matter of being in the right place at the right time,</v>

241
00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:36.243
<v Speaker 2>the right time.</v>

242
00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:38.020
<v Speaker 2>So all that having been said,</v>

243
00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:38.320
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

244
00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:38.561
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

245
00:08:38.561 --> 00:08:38.891
<v Speaker 2>and you're,</v>

246
00:08:38.891 --> 00:08:39.790
<v Speaker 2>you're absolutely right.</v>

247
00:08:39.791 --> 00:08:43.300
<v Speaker 2>We have to acknowledge the none zero role of,</v>

248
00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:44.383
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

249
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:44.741
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

250
00:08:44.741 --> 00:08:49.300
<v Speaker 2>of hereditary can permit and talent the one zero role of chance.</v>

251
00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:54.570
<v Speaker 2>And that still leaves a big chunk of the variance that could be due to systemic</v>

252
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.640
<v Speaker 2>features of the system that perhaps ought to be changed.</v>

253
00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:00.180
<v Speaker 2>There's just no doubt that the wealthy game,</v>

254
00:09:00.181 --> 00:09:00.721
<v Speaker 2>the system,</v>

255
00:09:00.721 --> 00:09:03.800
<v Speaker 2>particularly in the United States in a number of ways that don't work to,</v>

256
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:04.550
<v Speaker 2>to the,</v>

257
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:06.750
<v Speaker 2>the benefit of society at large.</v>

258
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:11.430
<v Speaker 2>There are also aspects of the system that are perhaps fair but irrational.</v>

259
00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:16.020
<v Speaker 2>The fact that so much of our intellectual talent now gets sucked into finance.</v>

260
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:19.680
<v Speaker 2>Now of course we do need a financial sector and it's good that they're smart</v>

261
00:09:19.681 --> 00:09:21.000
<v Speaker 2>people in it,</v>

262
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:26.270
<v Speaker 2>but having a lot of our brain power devoted to figuring out how to act on</v>

263
00:09:26.341 --> 00:09:27.630
<v Speaker 2>financial information,</v>

264
00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:32.860
<v Speaker 2>it Microsoft microsecond faster than ones competitors is probably not the best</v>

265
00:09:32.881 --> 00:09:35.280
<v Speaker 2>use of our society's intellectual capital.</v>

266
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:35.941
<v Speaker 2>Likewise,</v>

267
00:09:35.941 --> 00:09:36.540
<v Speaker 2>a lot of,</v>

268
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:40.600
<v Speaker 2>there's no doubt that we have far too much brain power invested in,</v>

269
00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:44.730
<v Speaker 2>in the the legal system in a corporation suing each other,</v>

270
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:48.000
<v Speaker 2>patent trolling and another not so productive uses.</v>

271
00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:48.371
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

272
00:09:48.371 --> 00:09:50.080
<v Speaker 1>Well the funny thing is too,</v>

273
00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:51.133
<v Speaker 1>there's an,</v>

274
00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:55.600
<v Speaker 1>there's a new routing in erotic or amount of pathology in,</v>

275
00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.520
<v Speaker 1>in a system in some sense.</v>

276
00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:02.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean one of the things that struck me quite hard for example is that if you</v>

277
00:10:02.201 --> 00:10:07.201
<v Speaker 1>look at the creativity curves across the lifespan,</v>

278
00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:11.140
<v Speaker 1>they matched the criminality curves almost perfectly.</v>

279
00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:15.080
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that made me think when I was doing that research was so</v>

280
00:10:15.081 --> 00:10:17.470
<v Speaker 1>that as young men become more antisocial,</v>

281
00:10:17.471 --> 00:10:18.820
<v Speaker 1>they also become more creative.</v>

282
00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:20.770
<v Speaker 1>Even though those things might not be correlated,</v>

283
00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:24.760
<v Speaker 1>but they do map on top of one another and we're sticking in a society like the</v>

284
00:10:24.761 --> 00:10:25.630
<v Speaker 1>United States,</v>

285
00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:29.560
<v Speaker 1>which has a fair degree of criminality but also a fair degree of creativity.</v>

286
00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:34.770
<v Speaker 1>We have no idea how loose the system has to be so that malfeasance can thrive so</v>

287
00:10:36.911 --> 00:10:40.720
<v Speaker 1>that it can also be simultaneously loose enough so that creativity can thrive.</v>

288
00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:41.740
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

289
00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:44.560
<v Speaker 1>Because you might think if you were optimistic that you can tighten up the</v>

290
00:10:44.561 --> 00:10:48.730
<v Speaker 1>system and get rid of the criminal behavior without adding a totalitarian layer</v>

291
00:10:48.731 --> 00:10:51.940
<v Speaker 1>to this system that would also simultaneously demolish,</v>

292
00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:52.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

293
00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:54.970
<v Speaker 1>individual variability and creativity.</v>

294
00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:55.751
<v Speaker 1>We just,</v>

295
00:10:55.751 --> 00:10:59.560
<v Speaker 1>our models just aren't sophisticated enough to tease such things apart,</v>

296
00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:00.370
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

297
00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:01.050
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

298
00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:01.490
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

299
00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:01.701
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

300
00:11:01.701 --> 00:11:03.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm not so sure there.</v>

301
00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:06.040
<v Speaker 2>I do agree with you that there's a certain amount of,</v>

302
00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:06.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

303
00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:07.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

304
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
<v Speaker 2>risk taking or young men on the bake that might underlie both criminality and,</v>

305
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:12.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

306
00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:13.990
<v Speaker 2>productive creativity.</v>

307
00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:14.610
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

308
00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:14.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

309
00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:16.120
<v Speaker 2>over the course of history,</v>

310
00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:19.450
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the accomplishments of civilization and indeed of,</v>

311
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:20.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

312
00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:20.951
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

313
00:11:20.951 --> 00:11:24.730
<v Speaker 2>of enlightenment driven progress is that we have managed to tease them apart.</v>

314
00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:29.800
<v Speaker 2>Just two examples are the fact that the rate of homicide punished by a factor of</v>

315
00:11:29.801 --> 00:11:33.430
<v Speaker 2>about 35 from the Middle Ages to the 20th century and that,</v>

316
00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:35.860
<v Speaker 2>and that includes the scientific revolution,</v>

317
00:11:35.861 --> 00:11:37.360
<v Speaker 2>the Industrial Revolution,</v>

318
00:11:37.361 --> 00:11:40.210
<v Speaker 2>and the enlightenment to all of the events of the 20th century.</v>

319
00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.490
<v Speaker 2>So justice people were not stabbing each other.</v>

320
00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:43.870
<v Speaker 2>So if we're in salts,</v>

321
00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:48.550
<v Speaker 2>they were also coming up with the theory of evolution than the atomic theory of</v>

322
00:11:48.551 --> 00:11:49.180
<v Speaker 2>matter.</v>

323
00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:49.830
<v Speaker 2>And then again,</v>

324
00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:54.830
<v Speaker 2>the 1990s when the rate of violent crime in the United States fell by half,</v>

325
00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:57.030
<v Speaker 2>and they were also declines in Canada,</v>

326
00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:57.790
<v Speaker 2>Britain,</v>

327
00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:58.900
<v Speaker 2>other western countries.</v>

328
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.600
<v Speaker 2>This certainly was not a time of economic stagnation or tech.</v>

329
00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:03.511
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

330
00:12:03.511 --> 00:12:04.010
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

331
00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:04.800
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough.</v>

332
00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:08.520
<v Speaker 1>I guess then the question starts to become is how in the world did those things</v>

333
00:12:08.521 --> 00:12:12.210
<v Speaker 1>get teased apart so that we are able to regulate anti social behavior without</v>

334
00:12:12.211 --> 00:12:14.490
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously making things,</v>

335
00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:15.673
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

336
00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:18.000
<v Speaker 1>excessively rigid,</v>

337
00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:19.560
<v Speaker 1>unregulated totalitarian.</v>

338
00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:20.513
<v Speaker 1>We managed it.</v>

339
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:23.790
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's part of that same incremental process that you detailed out at the</v>

340
00:12:23.791 --> 00:12:24.720
<v Speaker 1>beginning of our talk.</v>
