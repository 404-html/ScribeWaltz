1
00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.630
<v Speaker 1>Can you talk more about the resurrection?</v>

2
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.980
<v Speaker 1>This remains a stumbling block for many of your more atheistic followers who</v>

3
00:00:12.981 --> 00:00:16.070
<v Speaker 1>have otherwise embraced you approach to understanding Christianity?</v>

4
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.721
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5
00:00:17.721 --> 00:00:22.000
<v Speaker 1>I can only talk about it symbolically to begin with and that's I think,</v>

6
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.510
<v Speaker 1>not sufficient.</v>

7
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.200
<v Speaker 1>But I hope as I move through the biblical series that I can zero in on that more</v>

8
00:00:29.511 --> 00:00:30.860
<v Speaker 1>and more particularly.</v>

9
00:00:30.861 --> 00:00:35.861
<v Speaker 1>But I mean the idea of the dying and resurrected God is a very old idea</v>

10
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.720
<v Speaker 1>and it's echoed in such things as the imagery say of the Phoenix,</v>

11
00:00:41.721 --> 00:00:45.080
<v Speaker 1>which burns itself up and then restores itself to its,</v>

12
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.090
<v Speaker 1>to its early form.</v>

13
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.530
<v Speaker 1>And I think speaking purely psychologically,</v>

14
00:00:51.531 --> 00:00:56.531
<v Speaker 1>that idea of the dying and resurrected savior is something like a reflection of</v>

15
00:00:56.931 --> 00:01:01.931
<v Speaker 1>the fact that in order to progress psychologically you have to let go,</v>

16
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.700
<v Speaker 1>especially in the face of obstacles.</v>

17
00:01:04.701 --> 00:01:08.900
<v Speaker 1>You have to let go of those things that are impeding your progress that might be</v>

18
00:01:08.901 --> 00:01:10.100
<v Speaker 1>very dear to your heart.</v>

19
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.440
<v Speaker 1>You have to let them go and let them die.</v>

20
00:01:12.441 --> 00:01:15.080
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to let a new part of yourself be born.</v>

21
00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.510
<v Speaker 1>So because when you're wrong,</v>

22
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.370
<v Speaker 1>you have to let the part of you,</v>

23
00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:20.330
<v Speaker 1>that's wrong guy.</v>

24
00:01:20.331 --> 00:01:23.830
<v Speaker 1>And then a new part spring to life in some sensor.</v>

25
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.210
<v Speaker 1>It's a new part that's partly a union of your mind and the Union of the</v>

26
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.550
<v Speaker 1>information that's contained in the error that you committed.</v>

27
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.700
<v Speaker 1>And it's like the birth in some sense of the new spirit.</v>

28
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.330
<v Speaker 1>And so you could say that there's this idea that you have to have faith in</v>

29
00:01:40.701 --> 00:01:43.730
<v Speaker 1>Christ because Christ is the way and the truth and the life.</v>

30
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.010
<v Speaker 1>No one comes to the father but through,</v>

31
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.933
<v Speaker 1>but through him.</v>

32
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.030
<v Speaker 1>What that means symbolically as far as I can tell them,</v>

33
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.240
<v Speaker 1>is that you have to embrace the process of voluntary death and rebirth in order</v>

34
00:01:55.581 --> 00:01:59.030
<v Speaker 1>to continue moving forward properly in your life.</v>

35
00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.360
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>

36
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.960
<v Speaker 1>it's also that process of death and rebirth that rejuvenates the father.</v>

37
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.580
<v Speaker 1>And it's also that process of death and rebirth that produces the father to</v>

38
00:02:07.581 --> 00:02:08.270
<v Speaker 1>begin with.</v>

39
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.450
<v Speaker 1>If you think about the father as the symbol of of culture.</v>

40
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.390
<v Speaker 1>So at minimum,</v>

41
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.750
<v Speaker 1>the idea of the resurrected Christ is the idea that you should identify not with</v>

42
00:02:20.001 --> 00:02:24.380
<v Speaker 1>that part of yourself that's stagnant and dad and that already knows but is</v>

43
00:02:24.381 --> 00:02:25.220
<v Speaker 1>prone to error.</v>

44
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.690
<v Speaker 1>You should identify with that part of yourself that's always stretching beyond</v>

45
00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:34.691
<v Speaker 1>what you currently know and has the faith to let go of old certainties so that</v>

46
00:02:34.761 --> 00:02:38.360
<v Speaker 1>new patterns of being can be brought into place.</v>

47
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.990
<v Speaker 1>And so now that's a purely psychological explanation and I think I've made the</v>

48
00:02:45.891 --> 00:02:49.280
<v Speaker 1>case in my biblical lectures that I'm striving for a psychological</v>

49
00:02:49.281 --> 00:02:50.600
<v Speaker 1>interpretation at the moment.</v>

50
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.830
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

51
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.830
<v Speaker 1>my experience with the biblical stories is that there are layers of depth in</v>

52
00:02:57.781 --> 00:03:01.360
<v Speaker 1>them that are sufficiently profound,</v>

53
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.070
<v Speaker 1>perhaps because of that staggering hyperlinking of the text and its association</v>

54
00:03:06.071 --> 00:03:11.071
<v Speaker 1>with almost the entire Corpus of Western literature that as you keep digging,</v>

55
00:03:12.071 --> 00:03:13.300
<v Speaker 1>you find more and more.</v>

56
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.193
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

57
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.303
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

58
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to make of the more metaphysical claims,</v>

59
00:03:19.181 --> 00:03:20.014
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

60
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.560
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

61
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.930
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to leave it at that because I don't know.</v>

62
00:03:22.931 --> 00:03:24.190
<v Speaker 1>It's only speculation.</v>

63
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:25.743
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

64
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.661
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

65
00:03:28.661 --> 00:03:29.920
<v Speaker 1>I guess it is that we don't,</v>

66
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.400
<v Speaker 1>I really don't believe that we understand consciousness and we don't understand</v>

67
00:03:34.401 --> 00:03:36.730
<v Speaker 1>this rule in the cosmos.</v>

68
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.670
<v Speaker 1>It could be that consciousness is just an epithet phenomena of materialist</v>

69
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.513
<v Speaker 1>processes,</v>

70
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.940
<v Speaker 1>but there's a couple of things to me that seems to mitigate against that</v>

71
00:03:45.941 --> 00:03:46.790
<v Speaker 1>explanation.</v>

72
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.170
<v Speaker 1>The first is that we don't have an account of cautiousness that's that's useful.</v>

73
00:03:52.841 --> 00:03:57.640
<v Speaker 1>We have no idea how the material substrate of the brain produces this,</v>

74
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.980
<v Speaker 1>this awareness and self awareness that seems to be crucially important in the</v>

75
00:04:02.981 --> 00:04:07.660
<v Speaker 1>existence of the cosmos in so far as if there's nothing to experience something.</v>

76
00:04:07.661 --> 00:04:10.750
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to say in what way that it exists.</v>

77
00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.120
<v Speaker 1>You need a viewer and an observer.</v>

78
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.990
<v Speaker 1>Scientists sort of gerrymandered that by positing a hypothetical observer when</v>

79
00:04:17.991 --> 00:04:22.930
<v Speaker 1>they talk about a phenomena where there is no actual observance and so</v>

80
00:04:22.931 --> 00:04:25.540
<v Speaker 1>consciousness could be just an epiphenomenon,</v>

81
00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.470
<v Speaker 1>but it could also be something central to the nature of being and certainly</v>

82
00:04:29.471 --> 00:04:32.770
<v Speaker 1>mythological stories presented that way that there's,</v>

83
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.250
<v Speaker 1>there's nature now.</v>

84
00:04:34.251 --> 00:04:37.960
<v Speaker 1>It would be nurture from the scientific perspective and there's the social world</v>

85
00:04:37.961 --> 00:04:40.840
<v Speaker 1>that would be the great father from the mythological perspective.</v>

86
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.160
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

87
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.560
<v Speaker 1>and that's all there is from a scientific perspective.</v>

88
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.450
<v Speaker 1>But from a mythological perspective,</v>

89
00:04:46.451 --> 00:04:50.590
<v Speaker 1>there's active consciousness and that's associated with the idea of the logos</v>

90
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.750
<v Speaker 1>and the logos seems to be something like if you think about it as consciousness,</v>

91
00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.080
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be this thing that encounters the potential of future being and then</v>

92
00:05:01.361 --> 00:05:03.700
<v Speaker 1>determines at least in part how to shape it.</v>

93
00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.700
<v Speaker 1>Obviously we're constrained in many ways.</v>

94
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.430
<v Speaker 1>You can't shape things in any old way,</v>

95
00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:10.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

96
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.350
<v Speaker 1>but we can certainly advance in the direction of our imagination in quite a</v>

97
00:05:14.351 --> 00:05:16.480
<v Speaker 1>staggering and compelling manner.</v>

98
00:05:16.481 --> 00:05:17.800
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>

99
00:05:17.801 --> 00:05:18.634
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

100
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:19.690
<v Speaker 1>is that real?</v>

101
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.830
<v Speaker 1>Is Is,</v>

102
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.830
<v Speaker 1>is the idea that we have a consciousness and that it's free and some in</v>

103
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.710
<v Speaker 1>incomprehensible sense and that it plays a role in constructing the cosmos?</v>

104
00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:32.770
<v Speaker 1>Is that real?</v>

105
00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.510
<v Speaker 1>And then I would say,</v>

106
00:05:34.511 --> 00:05:36.280
<v Speaker 1>well it depends on what you mean by real,</v>

107
00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.340
<v Speaker 1>but I would also point out that you act as if it's real and that are functional</v>

108
00:05:41.351 --> 00:05:42.310
<v Speaker 1>legal systems,</v>

109
00:05:42.311 --> 00:05:46.810
<v Speaker 1>like the legal systems of the on the West are predicated on the acceptance of</v>

110
00:05:46.811 --> 00:05:47.644
<v Speaker 1>its reality.</v>

111
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.210
<v Speaker 1>And it was an idea that took many,</v>

112
00:05:49.211 --> 00:05:52.270
<v Speaker 1>many thousands of years to to emerge.</v>

113
00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:53.380
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

114
00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:54.041
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

115
00:05:54.041 --> 00:05:56.650
<v Speaker 1>the only sovereign was well was the king.</v>

116
00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:57.230
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

117
00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.240
<v Speaker 1>and then the nobles became sovereign and then men became Sawford.</v>

118
00:06:01.241 --> 00:06:02.870
<v Speaker 1>And then with the Christian revolution,</v>

119
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.660
<v Speaker 1>every individual soul became sovereign.</v>

120
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.890
<v Speaker 1>That idea of,</v>

121
00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:11.300
<v Speaker 1>of individual sovereignty and worth is the core presupposition of our legal</v>

122
00:06:11.301 --> 00:06:12.950
<v Speaker 1>system and our cultural systems.</v>

123
00:06:12.951 --> 00:06:17.951
<v Speaker 1>And so we all walk around acting as if every one of us is a divine center of</v>

124
00:06:19.371 --> 00:06:23.890
<v Speaker 1>logos because we give each other the respect of,</v>

125
00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:24.950
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

126
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:29.950
<v Speaker 1>of individual citizens who are sovereign and that are equal before the law.</v>

127
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:31.730
<v Speaker 1>And the funny thing is,</v>

128
00:06:31.731 --> 00:06:33.500
<v Speaker 1>is if someone doesn't treat you that way,</v>

129
00:06:33.501 --> 00:06:35.770
<v Speaker 1>it treats you as if you're free.</v>

130
00:06:35.771 --> 00:06:40.771
<v Speaker 1>Will is an illusion or refuses to regard you as someone who plays a active part</v>

131
00:06:43.311 --> 00:06:45.110
<v Speaker 1>in choosing outcome of their life,</v>

132
00:06:45.111 --> 00:06:45.891
<v Speaker 1>then you get very,</v>

133
00:06:45.891 --> 00:06:46.724
<v Speaker 1>very annoyed.</v>

134
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.570
<v Speaker 1>And so if it's an illusion and perhaps it is,</v>

135
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.860
<v Speaker 1>we don't understand an alternative to it and it's unbelievably,</v>

136
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.990
<v Speaker 1>it's unbelievably functional.</v>

137
00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:58.663
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

138
00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:00.051
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

139
00:07:00.051 --> 00:07:01.100
<v Speaker 1>so back to love.</v>

140
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:02.443
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

141
00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:03.493
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

142
00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:09.650
<v Speaker 1>it will make the case that a limitation is necessary for being,</v>

143
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:16.100
<v Speaker 1>and then we can make the case the tragedy is an inevitable consequence of</v>

144
00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:17.271
<v Speaker 1>limitation.</v>

145
00:07:17.271 --> 00:07:18.140
<v Speaker 1>And then we might say,</v>

146
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:18.381
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

147
00:07:18.381 --> 00:07:21.170
<v Speaker 1>is being worth the tragedy?</v>

148
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.980
<v Speaker 1>And I think the answer yes to that is love.</v>

149
00:07:24.981 --> 00:07:27.980
<v Speaker 1>And the answer no to that is the opposite of love.</v>

150
00:07:27.981 --> 00:07:29.270
<v Speaker 1>Because when you,</v>

151
00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:31.130
<v Speaker 1>when you love someone,</v>

152
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:33.770
<v Speaker 1>you love them in spite of,</v>

153
00:07:33.771 --> 00:07:35.600
<v Speaker 1>or even because of their vulnerability,</v>

154
00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:38.330
<v Speaker 1>not that you don't want them to transcend that because you do.</v>

155
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:39.700
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

156
00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:44.700
<v Speaker 1>and I think that love is the acceptance of the price of being.</v>

157
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.611
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

158
00:07:45.611 --> 00:07:48.590
<v Speaker 1>it's the way you manifest your acceptance of the price of being.</v>

159
00:07:48.591 --> 00:07:49.730
<v Speaker 1>Because if you love someone,</v>

160
00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:53.180
<v Speaker 1>you know they have their vulnerabilities like every human being.</v>

161
00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:58.480
<v Speaker 1>But your basic judgment is that despite the fact that they have these</v>

162
00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.880
<v Speaker 1>vulnerabilities that are even fatal,</v>

163
00:08:01.881 --> 00:08:03.200
<v Speaker 1>and that there are certainly tragic,</v>

164
00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.800
<v Speaker 1>that it's better that they were then that they weren't.</v>

165
00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.540
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

166
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.830
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's the right attitude to have towards being itself.</v>

167
00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:13.610
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

168
00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:14.443
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

169
00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:15.530
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

170
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:20.270
<v Speaker 1>it's an optimistic attitude and I think it has to be predicated on faith because</v>

171
00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:24.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that you can necessarily derive that conclusion by,</v>

172
00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.090
<v Speaker 1>by looking at the available evidence.</v>

173
00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:28.910
<v Speaker 1>Dealable evidence has kind of 50,</v>

174
00:08:28.911 --> 00:08:29.361
<v Speaker 1>50,</v>

175
00:08:29.361 --> 00:08:30.830
<v Speaker 1>and in many situations,</v>

176
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:32.323
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

177
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:37.910
<v Speaker 1>but I can tell you if you adopt the other attitude that being is unjustifiable,</v>

178
00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:39.590
<v Speaker 1>then that leads you down a very,</v>

179
00:08:39.591 --> 00:08:44.510
<v Speaker 1>very dark road and then you soon start to work in a way that makes things far</v>

180
00:08:44.511 --> 00:08:46.490
<v Speaker 1>more intolerable then they should be.</v>

181
00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.990
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

182
00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:49.853
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

183
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:51.920
<v Speaker 1>that's my answer to that.</v>

184
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:54.740
<v Speaker 1>Any tips on avoiding booze?</v>

185
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.011
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

186
00:08:56.011 --> 00:08:57.090
<v Speaker 1>that's a real tough one.</v>

187
00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:57.451
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

188
00:08:57.451 --> 00:08:58.890
<v Speaker 1>I would say a couple of things.</v>

189
00:08:58.891 --> 00:08:59.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

190
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:00.413
<v Speaker 1>there is a drug,</v>

191
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:01.590
<v Speaker 1>if you're a binge drinker,</v>

192
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:05.940
<v Speaker 1>there is a drug called naltrexone that you could consider and you take</v>

193
00:09:05.941 --> 00:09:07.200
<v Speaker 1>naltrexone every day.</v>

194
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.080
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't really have any psychological effect on you,</v>

195
00:09:10.081 --> 00:09:12.660
<v Speaker 1>but if you're a naltrexone responder,</v>

196
00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:16.830
<v Speaker 1>what will happen is that it will dampen your positive response to alcohol.</v>

197
00:09:16.831 --> 00:09:18.990
<v Speaker 1>So some people who are alcoholic,</v>

198
00:09:18.991 --> 00:09:21.390
<v Speaker 1>many of them have a very pronounced opiate,</v>

199
00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:22.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

200
00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:23.773
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

201
00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:26.040
<v Speaker 1>an opiate effect from alcohol.</v>

202
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:30.690
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it's mediated by Beta endorphin and Naltrexone is an opiate</v>

203
00:09:30.691 --> 00:09:31.261
<v Speaker 1>blocker.</v>

204
00:09:31.261 --> 00:09:32.094
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

205
00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:33.223
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

206
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:38.630
<v Speaker 1>what naltrexone seems to do is dampen the positive response and the positive</v>

207
00:09:38.731 --> 00:09:39.564
<v Speaker 1>response,</v>

208
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:41.130
<v Speaker 1>which would be opiate.</v>

209
00:09:41.131 --> 00:09:46.050
<v Speaker 1>And then dopaminergic is the same response that makes you want to keep drinking</v>

210
00:09:46.051 --> 00:09:47.040
<v Speaker 1>when you start drinking.</v>

211
00:09:47.041 --> 00:09:49.860
<v Speaker 1>So if you're one of those people that has a drink and then has to have another</v>

212
00:09:49.861 --> 00:09:51.240
<v Speaker 1>one and then it has to have another one,</v>

213
00:09:51.241 --> 00:09:51.871
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

214
00:09:51.871 --> 00:09:53.220
<v Speaker 1>as soon all your money's gone,</v>

215
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:56.940
<v Speaker 1>then the probability that you have an opiod response is pretty high.</v>

216
00:09:56.941 --> 00:09:59.370
<v Speaker 1>And now trick someone can help with that.</v>

217
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.210
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

218
00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:02.480
<v Speaker 1>generally when people take Naltrexone,</v>

219
00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:03.360
<v Speaker 1>they keep drinking,</v>

220
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:04.500
<v Speaker 1>they try to control,</v>

221
00:10:04.501 --> 00:10:08.460
<v Speaker 1>but they keep drinking and they learn over time that the alcohol doesn't have</v>

222
00:10:08.461 --> 00:10:09.420
<v Speaker 1>the same punch.</v>

223
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:12.690
<v Speaker 1>It's still pleasant but doesn't have the same overwhelming punched that it did</v>

224
00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:13.733
<v Speaker 1>at one point.</v>

225
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.310
<v Speaker 1>So that would be one suggestion and it's worth trying.</v>

226
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.010
<v Speaker 1>The other is like make a plan.</v>

227
00:10:20.011 --> 00:10:22.050
<v Speaker 1>I would say do the future authoring program,</v>

228
00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:22.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

229
00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:25.050
<v Speaker 1>because it isn't that you're trying to avoid booze.</v>

230
00:10:25.051 --> 00:10:25.884
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

231
00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:28.740
<v Speaker 1>It's that you're trying to restructure your whole life,</v>

232
00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:29.101
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

233
00:10:29.101 --> 00:10:32.530
<v Speaker 1>because if you're a drinker then all your friends are drinkers and,</v>

234
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:37.530
<v Speaker 1>and you're used to drinking it every social situation and the places that you go</v>

235
00:10:37.531 --> 00:10:41.610
<v Speaker 1>to socialize or places that you drink and like it's really built in as a whole</v>

236
00:10:41.611 --> 00:10:42.510
<v Speaker 1>set of habits.</v>

237
00:10:42.511 --> 00:10:46.530
<v Speaker 1>And so what you have to do is kind of redesigning your life and you have to</v>

238
00:10:46.531 --> 00:10:47.430
<v Speaker 1>think of things.</v>

239
00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:49.800
<v Speaker 1>You can't just stop drinking.</v>

240
00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:54.330
<v Speaker 1>You have to figure out what you're going to start doing instead of drinking.</v>

241
00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.590
<v Speaker 1>There's a hole that you have to fill in and you know,</v>

242
00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.920
<v Speaker 1>the future authoring program,</v>

243
00:10:58.921 --> 00:11:02.430
<v Speaker 1>we'll also help you figure out what your life could look like in the absence of</v>

244
00:11:02.431 --> 00:11:07.431
<v Speaker 1>alcohol and what kind of Hell you could end up being if you keep drinking.</v>

245
00:11:08.161 --> 00:11:08.420
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

246
00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:10.740
<v Speaker 1>and it causes all the problems that it can cause.</v>

247
00:11:10.741 --> 00:11:12.980
<v Speaker 1>And I think you really need to like,</v>

248
00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:16.980
<v Speaker 1>you need to think through the hell that can occur and you have to think through</v>

249
00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:21.060
<v Speaker 1>how your life could be valuable without alcohol calls so that you can be</v>

250
00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:22.710
<v Speaker 1>motivated enough to,</v>

251
00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:24.323
<v Speaker 1>to try to,</v>

252
00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:25.530
<v Speaker 1>to regulate it.</v>

253
00:11:25.531 --> 00:11:28.650
<v Speaker 1>And I would also say if you fail and slip,</v>

254
00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:31.530
<v Speaker 1>don't berate yourself and beat yourself up.</v>

255
00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:33.720
<v Speaker 1>Just start quitting again.</v>

256
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:34.740
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>

257
00:11:34.741 --> 00:11:39.060
<v Speaker 1>if you could cut your alcohol intake down 75% that's a hell of a lot better than</v>

258
00:11:39.061 --> 00:11:39.894
<v Speaker 1>zero.</v>

259
00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:43.470
<v Speaker 1>And often people go all or nothing just like they do when they're quitting</v>

260
00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:44.710
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes and all.</v>

261
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:47.220
<v Speaker 1>They all quit for a month and then have a cigarette and they'll say,</v>

262
00:11:47.221 --> 00:11:47.791
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

263
00:11:47.791 --> 00:11:50.070
<v Speaker 1>now I'm now I've broken the pact.</v>

264
00:11:50.071 --> 00:11:52.920
<v Speaker 1>And then they'll smoke all pack and they'll be smoking again.</v>

265
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.340
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to do that.</v>

266
00:11:54.341 --> 00:11:58.420
<v Speaker 1>You can just decide that you slipped and that you're going to get back on the</v>

267
00:11:58.421 --> 00:11:59.254
<v Speaker 1>wagon again.</v>

268
00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:00.191
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

269
00:12:00.191 --> 00:12:01.390
<v Speaker 1>it can take a long time,</v>

270
00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:04.870
<v Speaker 1>but I do believe that you need it a better vision of life,</v>

271
00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:05.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

272
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:08.080
<v Speaker 1>You have to find something to do that's better than alcohol.</v>

273
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:10.060
<v Speaker 1>And that might take some,</v>

274
00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:11.350
<v Speaker 1>some real consideration,</v>

275
00:12:11.351 --> 00:12:15.550
<v Speaker 1>especially if alcohol is a very potent drug for you.</v>

276
00:12:15.551 --> 00:12:19.000
<v Speaker 1>And I would also say don't hesitate to try the nail trek.</v>

277
00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:24.010
<v Speaker 1>Solomon's it's got a pretty decent clinical history and it's basically harmless.</v>

278
00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:25.120
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
