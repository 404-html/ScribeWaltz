WEBVTT

1
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.133
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.730
<v Speaker 1>would give you stadiums and why</v>

3
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.090
<v Speaker 1>even really contemplating what we're doing.</v>

4
00:00:22.091 --> 00:00:24.790
<v Speaker 1>We're you see the sports team,</v>

5
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.320
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

6
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.320
<v Speaker 1>it's a cooperative and competitive attempt to specify and hit a target and we're</v>

7
00:00:32.891 --> 00:00:33.970
<v Speaker 1>so excited about that.</v>

8
00:00:33.971 --> 00:00:37.840
<v Speaker 1>Probably because of these two part were built physiologically going on hunting</v>

9
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:38.683
<v Speaker 1>platform,</v>

10
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.240
<v Speaker 1>throwing platform,</v>

11
00:00:40.241 --> 00:00:40.410
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

12
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean human beings can throat and we can throw a punch or throw a ball and</v>

13
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.470
<v Speaker 1>throw a spear and that's a big deal.</v>

14
00:00:47.471 --> 00:00:49.030
<v Speaker 1>That's a big part of what we are.</v>

15
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.710
<v Speaker 1>So Ricardo seeking creatures and so to be precisely for speeches,</v>

16
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.850
<v Speaker 1>to specify the target is specify the target is to have an aid.</v>

17
00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.210
<v Speaker 1>They have an aim is to have a purpose and to aid properly institute attain your</v>

18
00:01:01.211 --> 00:01:02.890
<v Speaker 1>purpose at least in principle.</v>

19
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.220
<v Speaker 1>And so partly what we're doing in the future authoring exercises to specify your</v>

20
00:01:08.591 --> 00:01:10.970
<v Speaker 1>purpose with your precise fish.</v>

21
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.000
<v Speaker 1>And so we asked people to,</v>

22
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.500
<v Speaker 1>well here's another thing to contemplate.</v>

23
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.510
<v Speaker 1>We are creatures were built one hunting platform.</v>

24
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.660
<v Speaker 1>We'd like to hit targets as possible that we're good at it.</v>

25
00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.330
<v Speaker 1>And then what that also means is that,</v>

26
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.541
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

27
00:01:28.541 --> 00:01:30.350
<v Speaker 1>if we aren't good at it and it's,</v>

28
00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:31.420
<v Speaker 1>that's part of what we are,</v>

29
00:01:31.421 --> 00:01:33.960
<v Speaker 1>then if you specify target,</v>

30
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.240
<v Speaker 1>you might be able to hit it.</v>

31
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.630
<v Speaker 1>That's a hell of a thing.</v>

32
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:38.020
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

33
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.760
<v Speaker 1>there's a statement in the New Testament,</v>

34
00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.740
<v Speaker 1>it's quite a strange statement and it's a,</v>

35
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:43.610
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

36
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:44.830
<v Speaker 1>it's a suggestion.</v>

37
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.150
<v Speaker 1>The suggestion is that if you knock the door will open that if you ask,</v>

38
00:01:49.151 --> 00:01:51.340
<v Speaker 1>you will receive a new thing.</v>

39
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.860
<v Speaker 1>Well that seems highly likely and well I got to see highly unlikely,</v>

40
00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:56.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

41
00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that's the way the world is set up.</v>

42
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like that is actually the way the world is set up.</v>

43
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.030
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange thing and it's not that surprising if you start thinking</v>

44
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.050
<v Speaker 1>through and stuff,</v>

45
00:02:07.051 --> 00:02:07.750
<v Speaker 1>even after all,</v>

46
00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.040
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically through to the world evolution has been working three and a half</v>

47
00:02:12.041 --> 00:02:14.290
<v Speaker 1>billion years to produce you.</v>

48
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.183
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

49
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

50
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.440
<v Speaker 1>maybe I could've done a better job.</v>

51
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.433
<v Speaker 1>That's</v>

52
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:21.590
<v Speaker 1>such a bad job.</v>

53
00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.030
<v Speaker 1>So maybe she could have taken your aim.</v>

54
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.420
<v Speaker 1>What of the things that certainly learned as a clinical psychologist once.</v>

55
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.260
<v Speaker 1>Because a lot of the people that I saw who were unhappy with their life say</v>

56
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.270
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they're bigger than that,</v>

57
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.330
<v Speaker 1>and he had him detained what they wanted had been detained in Austin in large</v>

58
00:02:40.461 --> 00:02:42.410
<v Speaker 1>part because they never specified it,</v>

59
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.620
<v Speaker 1>and the probability that you're going to hit a tiny target precisely without</v>

60
00:02:48.231 --> 00:02:49.220
<v Speaker 1>aiming at it,</v>

61
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.450
<v Speaker 1>is serum.</v>

62
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.060
<v Speaker 1>That's not gonna happen so well.</v>

63
00:02:53.061 --> 00:02:55.940
<v Speaker 1>So what would have happened if you would aim at.</v>

64
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.010
<v Speaker 1>That's the question,</v>

65
00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.730
<v Speaker 1>how should you best aim?</v>

66
00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.000
<v Speaker 1>That's another question.</v>

67
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.750
<v Speaker 1>That's part of what rules for life about the rule for example,</v>

68
00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:09.040
<v Speaker 1>is treat yourself like you're someone responsible for helping.</v>

69
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.490
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a nice start,</v>

70
00:03:10.491 --> 00:03:13.050
<v Speaker 1>so I can imagine again,</v>

71
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.050
<v Speaker 1>if you're aiming a rifle,</v>

72
00:03:14.051 --> 00:03:17.050
<v Speaker 1>you have to put yourself in a certain physiological state,</v>

73
00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:17.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

74
00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.470
<v Speaker 1>What I'm taking some deep breaths and calm down and you want to make sure your</v>

75
00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:22.270
<v Speaker 1>hands are shaking a particularly good,</v>

76
00:03:22.271 --> 00:03:26.920
<v Speaker 1>so forth and put yourself in the right frame of mind and if you're going to take</v>

77
00:03:26.921 --> 00:03:27.701
<v Speaker 1>able with your life,</v>

78
00:03:27.701 --> 00:03:28.690
<v Speaker 1>it's the same thing.</v>

79
00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.380
<v Speaker 1>You have to put yourself in the right frame of mind and what's the right frame</v>

80
00:03:32.381 --> 00:03:36.130
<v Speaker 1>of mind and it might be something you can assume that you're actually,</v>

81
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.680
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically a valuable preacher even though you might not think that self is</v>

82
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:41.470
<v Speaker 1>your soul.</v>

83
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.040
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely knowledgeable about your own flaws insufficiencies,</v>

84
00:03:45.041 --> 00:03:46.870
<v Speaker 1>but independent of that,</v>

85
00:03:46.871 --> 00:03:47.471
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>

86
00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:48.304
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

87
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.040
<v Speaker 1>you can lend yourself a hand and you can do something good for yourself just up</v>

88
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.590
<v Speaker 1>with the goodness of your heart,</v>

89
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

90
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.340
<v Speaker 1>like you might do for someone that cared about.</v>

91
00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.890
<v Speaker 1>Now that's actually very difficult for people.</v>

92
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:00.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

93
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.540
<v Speaker 1>like most of us love someone or a couple of people or just half heartedly</v>

94
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.030
<v Speaker 1>released,</v>

95
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.330
<v Speaker 1>managed our children.</v>

96
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.871
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

97
00:04:06.871 --> 00:04:07.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

98
00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.350
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be fully committed to something,</v>

99
00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.330
<v Speaker 1>but generally,</v>

100
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.000
<v Speaker 1>generally we do a pretty good job with our,</v>

101
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.590
<v Speaker 1>with our partners or husbands and wives and a pretty good job with our children.</v>

102
00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.190
<v Speaker 1>It's a little more iffy there.</v>

103
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.570
<v Speaker 1>A decent job with parents.</v>

104
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.850
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

105
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:22.091
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

106
00:04:22.091 --> 00:04:23.590
<v Speaker 1>it's 70 slash 30 or whatever,</v>

107
00:04:23.591 --> 00:04:27.520
<v Speaker 1>but maybe you can get elevated more than that with a lot of effort.</v>

108
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.820
<v Speaker 1>But I don't know how good we are about doing that for ourselves.</v>

109
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.680
<v Speaker 1>I would say much less so.</v>

110
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.760
<v Speaker 1>And part of that is definitely the fact that we're very aware of our own flaws</v>

111
00:04:36.761 --> 00:04:38.620
<v Speaker 1>and insufficiencies personally,</v>

112
00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.210
<v Speaker 1>you know more about how regine useless you are fundamentally then above anyone</v>

113
00:04:43.211 --> 00:04:43.600
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

114
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.600
<v Speaker 1>And so that's rather disheartening given that it's disheartening then it's not</v>

115
00:04:48.671 --> 00:04:50.500
<v Speaker 1>so easy to take care of yourself properly,</v>

116
00:04:50.501 --> 00:04:51.430
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't know him.</v>

117
00:04:51.431 --> 00:04:53.280
<v Speaker 1>He is to me that you really have that,</v>

118
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.020
<v Speaker 1>that right not to take care of yourself.</v>

119
00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.010
<v Speaker 1>I think you have a responsibility to take care of yourself as if you're</v>

120
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.200
<v Speaker 1>something of value,</v>

121
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.850
<v Speaker 1>which you are.</v>

122
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.850
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a responsibility.</v>

123
00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.120
<v Speaker 1>And so when you filled out the future authoring program,</v>

124
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:11.460
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

125
00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.293
<v Speaker 1>you're asked to,</v>

126
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.890
<v Speaker 1>for the sake of experimentation,</v>

127
00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.260
<v Speaker 1>the frame of reference,</v>

128
00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:25.350
<v Speaker 1>a frame of reference within which you give yourself the benefit of the delta.</v>

129
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.890
<v Speaker 1>Then there's something about you that might be usefully brought forward into the</v>

130
00:05:29.891 --> 00:05:30.724
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

131
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.170
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

132
00:05:32.171 --> 00:05:32.390
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

133
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.751
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

134
00:05:32.751 --> 00:05:33.584
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

135
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.620
<v Speaker 1>an axiom of arts society that there is something about you that would be</v>

136
00:05:38.621 --> 00:05:41.980
<v Speaker 1>usefully be brought forward into the world because our whole society that's</v>

137
00:05:41.981 --> 00:05:46.260
<v Speaker 1>predicated on the notion of the sovereign individual or even of the dividing</v>

138
00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.360
<v Speaker 1>people and we wouldn't have a exceeded political power to each and every one of</v>

139
00:05:53.861 --> 00:05:58.861
<v Speaker 1>us if and would work unless there was actually something to the proposition that</v>

140
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.870
<v Speaker 1>each individual is something approximating a divine locus of value,</v>

141
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.570
<v Speaker 1>just our insufficiencies.</v>

142
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.840
<v Speaker 1>And so allowing yourself the benefit of the doubt seems like,</v>

143
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.770
<v Speaker 1>and philosophically appropriate,</v>

144
00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.290
<v Speaker 1>but it takes a certain amount of.</v>

145
00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:17.970
<v Speaker 1>It takes a certain amount of courage.</v>

146
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.420
<v Speaker 1>And so we asked people to think,</v>

147
00:06:20.421 --> 00:06:20.721
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

148
00:06:20.721 --> 00:06:21.501
<v Speaker 1>well here,</v>

149
00:06:21.501 --> 00:06:22.370
<v Speaker 1>here's a game.</v>

150
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:24.680
<v Speaker 1>You can have it if you a matter</v>

151
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:28.100
<v Speaker 1>possibility,</v>

152
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:30.470
<v Speaker 1>if you're able to progress.</v>

153
00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:31.850
<v Speaker 1>And would that make sense?</v>

154
00:06:31.851 --> 00:06:33.380
<v Speaker 1>Because it's really been something in property.</v>

155
00:06:33.381 --> 00:06:34.131
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to hit it.</v>

156
00:06:34.131 --> 00:06:35.450
<v Speaker 1>So you could have that.</v>

157
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.650
<v Speaker 1>You can hit were you a map?</v>

158
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:37.640
<v Speaker 1>If you make progress?</v>

159
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.950
<v Speaker 1>The question would be how when you eat properly nouns,</v>

160
00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:41.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

161
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:42.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

162
00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:46.670
<v Speaker 1>imagine you started to take care of yourself like something worth taking care</v>

163
00:06:46.671 --> 00:06:47.390
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>

164
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:48.223
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

165
00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:49.490
<v Speaker 1>so then you could say,</v>

166
00:06:49.491 --> 00:06:50.324
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

167
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.120
<v Speaker 1>if you could have one you wanted three to five years down the road,</v>

168
00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.310
<v Speaker 1>what would it be?</v>

169
00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:56.240
<v Speaker 1>One of the needed,</v>

170
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:57.780
<v Speaker 1>assuming you were taking care of yourself.</v>

171
00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.600
<v Speaker 1>Like if you can think about it like,</v>

172
00:06:59.601 --> 00:07:00.780
<v Speaker 1>do I take care of the Child?</v>

173
00:07:00.781 --> 00:07:02.900
<v Speaker 1>And if you're going to take care of a child,</v>

174
00:07:02.901 --> 00:07:05.270
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't just grab him or her,</v>

175
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.760
<v Speaker 1>his or her every whim.</v>

176
00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:09.200
<v Speaker 1>That's not care.</v>

177
00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.660
<v Speaker 1>So that isn't how you treat yourself.</v>

178
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.480
<v Speaker 1>You have to be more sensible not.</v>

179
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:14.091
<v Speaker 1>But we could say,</v>

180
00:07:14.091 --> 00:07:14.511
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

181
00:07:14.511 --> 00:07:14.781
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

182
00:07:14.781 --> 00:07:17.900
<v Speaker 1>you get to have what you need three to five years down the road.</v>

183
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:19.140
<v Speaker 1>What do you want from your family?</v>

184
00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:22.640
<v Speaker 1>If you could put your family together the way you wanted it to be together so</v>

185
00:07:22.641 --> 00:07:26.000
<v Speaker 1>you have what you want it from your father and your mother and your siblings and</v>

186
00:07:26.001 --> 00:07:26.840
<v Speaker 1>your kids,</v>

187
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.070
<v Speaker 1>just hypothetically,</v>

188
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.150
<v Speaker 1>what would that look like?</v>

189
00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.420
<v Speaker 1>Probably wouldn't look like the situation where you're all around Thanksgiving</v>

190
00:07:32.421 --> 00:07:34.190
<v Speaker 1>dinner with your hands around each other's necks,</v>

191
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:35.660
<v Speaker 1>squeezing slowly,</v>

192
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:40.730
<v Speaker 1>which is the condition that many families at Thanksgiving dinner.</v>

193
00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:44.980
<v Speaker 1>You probably wished for that and it would probably not be for the basket.</v>

194
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:46.093
<v Speaker 1>Then you might ask,</v>

195
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:46.941
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

196
00:07:46.941 --> 00:07:50.480
<v Speaker 1>what would you want from your from your intimate partner,</v>

197
00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:52.340
<v Speaker 1>if you could have what you needed,</v>

198
00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:57.090
<v Speaker 1>what would you want from your career and how you educate yourself?</v>

199
00:07:57.091 --> 00:08:02.091
<v Speaker 1>If you could do that with an auditable way or at least benetrends benefits</v>

200
00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.260
<v Speaker 1>panicking now,</v>

201
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:05.780
<v Speaker 1>how would we take care of your mental and physical health?</v>

202
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:09.530
<v Speaker 1>What would you do outside of work that would be meaningful and engaging in</v>

203
00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:10.160
<v Speaker 1>productive.</v>
