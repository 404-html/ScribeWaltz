00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.840
<v Speaker 1>Somebody asked me the other day if I believed in miracles and I hate being asked</v>

2
00:00:11.841 --> 00:00:12.740
<v Speaker 1>questions like that,</v>

3
00:00:12.741 --> 00:00:13.574
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.180
<v Speaker 1>and you know it's also people ask me to do,</v>

5
00:00:17.181 --> 00:00:20.600
<v Speaker 1>I believe in God and I don't know what they mean when they say that.</v>

6
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.450
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know what to answer because I don't think we're taught necessarily</v>

7
00:00:23.451 --> 00:00:24.800
<v Speaker 1>going to talk about the same thing.</v>

8
00:00:24.801 --> 00:00:25.790
<v Speaker 1>But in any case,</v>

9
00:00:25.791 --> 00:00:28.490
<v Speaker 1>I said yes and I have a variety of reasons for that,</v>

10
00:00:28.491 --> 00:00:29.540
<v Speaker 1>but one of them is that,</v>

11
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:30.933
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.230
<v Speaker 1>the consensus among physicists is that we can track the origin of the cosmos to</v>

13
00:00:39.561 --> 00:00:44.030
<v Speaker 1>something like 100 million of a millionth of a second after the big bang.</v>

14
00:00:44.031 --> 00:00:46.490
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's so close to the big bang that</v>

15
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.540
<v Speaker 1>the differences literally infinitesimal,</v>

16
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.630
<v Speaker 1>but the consensus is that before that,</v>

17
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.560
<v Speaker 1>whatever that is,</v>

18
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.020
<v Speaker 1>the laws of physics themselves breakdown,</v>

19
00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.023
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

20
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.260
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

21
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.850
<v Speaker 1>what do you call an event that exists outside the laws of physics?</v>

22
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.220
<v Speaker 1>That by definition that's a miracle.</v>

23
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.431
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

24
00:01:07.431 --> 00:01:12.260
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't necessarily mean that there's a transcendent daddy that caused the</v>

25
00:01:12.261 --> 00:01:12.651
<v Speaker 1>event.</v>

26
00:01:12.651 --> 00:01:13.820
<v Speaker 1>That's a separate issue.</v>

27
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.660
<v Speaker 1>But it does imply a barrier of some sort beyond which we can't go where some</v>

28
00:01:21.351 --> 00:01:22.850
<v Speaker 1>other set of rules apply.</v>

29
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.480
<v Speaker 1>And so I find that interesting as well.</v>
