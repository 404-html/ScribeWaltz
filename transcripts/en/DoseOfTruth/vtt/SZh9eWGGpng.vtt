1
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.620
<v Speaker 1>I think the women probably will man up and then we've never forgiven,</v>

2
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.900
<v Speaker 1>which is part of the reason why</v>

3
00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:22.503
<v Speaker 1>it's Rondo</v>

4
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:25.720
<v Speaker 1>killed all those people.</v>

5
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:27.303
<v Speaker 1>It's because</v>

6
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.390
<v Speaker 1>he didn't like it.</v>

7
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.293
<v Speaker 1>No one even,</v>

8
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.170
<v Speaker 1>and his cell phone was with something like,</v>

9
00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm constantly in such a way that what I've learned with rejection and then made</v>

10
00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:41.951
<v Speaker 1>it bigger.</v>

11
00:00:41.951 --> 00:00:44.460
<v Speaker 1>Your comprehension and murderers</v>

12
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.640
<v Speaker 1>and women are prone to reject him.</v>

13
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.470
<v Speaker 1>You have twice as many female ancestors is male ancestors and evolutionary</v>

14
00:00:55.471 --> 00:00:57.300
<v Speaker 1>biology seems quite clear.</v>

15
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.250
<v Speaker 1>The reason that we've diverged from a common ancestor of chimpanzees and human</v>

16
00:01:02.251 --> 00:01:07.251
<v Speaker 1>beings is because chimpanzee females are not sexually selective and human</v>

17
00:01:07.591 --> 00:01:09.210
<v Speaker 1>females are,</v>

18
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.320
<v Speaker 1>and that means that whatever progress we've paid as a species,</v>

19
00:01:13.321 --> 00:01:15.720
<v Speaker 1>assuming what we paid constitutes progress,</v>

20
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.060
<v Speaker 1>has been as a consequence of women to proclivity to reject.</v>

21
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.330
<v Speaker 1>And you might think,</v>

22
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.921
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

23
00:01:22.921 --> 00:01:23.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.050
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's a price worth paying,</v>

25
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.400
<v Speaker 1>but it's not necessarily a price that you want to pay.</v>

26
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.060
<v Speaker 1>If you happen to be one of those bands,</v>

27
00:01:29.061 --> 00:01:30.960
<v Speaker 1>you were constantly be rejected.</v>

28
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.810
<v Speaker 1>Now perhaps to the right attitude to that is,</v>

29
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.231
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

30
00:01:34.231 --> 00:01:38.400
<v Speaker 1>you should figure out how to retool yourself so that you're not being rejected</v>

31
00:01:38.401 --> 00:01:40.830
<v Speaker 1>by 50% of the population,</v>

32
00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:44.530
<v Speaker 1>which is fairly solid evidence that there might be something about you that's</v>

33
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.700
<v Speaker 1>not exactly like straight and appropriate,</v>

34
00:01:47.701 --> 00:01:48.534
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

35
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:49.380
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

36
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.390
<v Speaker 1>that's a harsh test,</v>

37
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.510
<v Speaker 1>the harshest of all possible judgements and it's very difficult thing for people</v>

38
00:01:54.511 --> 00:01:57.160
<v Speaker 1>to accept and no one did so,</v>

39
00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.600
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

40
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.433
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>

41
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.020
<v Speaker 1>he thinks having self conscious and then,</v>

42
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.831
<v Speaker 1>then what happens?</v>

43
00:02:01.831 --> 00:02:01.981
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

44
00:02:01.981 --> 00:02:06.720
<v Speaker 1>the next part of the story is a black quantity and so god goes for a walk to the</v>

45
00:02:06.721 --> 00:02:09.620
<v Speaker 1>guard and he's accustomed to walking without them.</v>

46
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.830
<v Speaker 1>But that means to me,</v>

47
00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:14.490
<v Speaker 1>I think it's something like we weren't conceptualized in this talk to some</v>

48
00:02:14.491 --> 00:02:15.750
<v Speaker 1>degree with God represents,</v>

49
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.160
<v Speaker 1>please can this part of the narrative quick going represents that divine</v>

50
00:02:20.161 --> 00:02:20.941
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>

51
00:02:20.941 --> 00:02:25.941
<v Speaker 1>let's say that you partake in that confronts the potential of chaos.</v>

52
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.160
<v Speaker 1>Some transplants actually to walk with that is to be guided by that principle.</v>

53
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.731
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

54
00:02:32.731 --> 00:02:35.910
<v Speaker 1>if you're on the street here on path to where you should be in your life,</v>

55
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.120
<v Speaker 1>then natural you do it.</v>

56
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.820
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that requires courage.</v>

57
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.800
<v Speaker 1>It requires you to be forthright.</v>

58
00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.900
<v Speaker 1>It requires you to look up into,</v>

59
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.500
<v Speaker 1>to try to make the world a better place rather than a terrible place.</v>

60
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:47.450
<v Speaker 1>And so out,</v>

61
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.220
<v Speaker 1>these just the customer's doing have him today after he's woken up and become</v>

62
00:02:51.221 --> 00:02:52.054
<v Speaker 1>self conscious,</v>

63
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.340
<v Speaker 1>he hides the,</v>

64
00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:55.174
<v Speaker 1>like the books.</v>

65
00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.130
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly why it's comical because you can't hide.</v>

66
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.590
<v Speaker 1>You can't hide from Bush</v>

67
00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.720
<v Speaker 1>a Bush.</v>

68
00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

69
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.060
<v Speaker 1>and it doesn't reflect her involve about to intelligence.</v>

70
00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:11.560
<v Speaker 1>This is fraud.</v>

71
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.820
<v Speaker 1>And he's hiding behind a bush and he comes up with three ladies.</v>

72
00:03:15.821 --> 00:03:16.654
<v Speaker 1>Excuse too.</v>

73
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.200
<v Speaker 1>So go ahead and calls officers,</v>

74
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:19.363
<v Speaker 1>what's up?</v>

75
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.280
<v Speaker 1>What are we supposed to go for a walk?</v>

76
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.113
<v Speaker 1>And then he says,</v>

77
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.243
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

78
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.280
<v Speaker 1>I make an end to shade.</v>

79
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.310
<v Speaker 1>And God says,</v>

80
00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:29.440
<v Speaker 1>who told you that you were naked?</v>

81
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.470
<v Speaker 1>And this is the terrible part of the story.</v>

82
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:33.490
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

83
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.671
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

84
00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:36.120
<v Speaker 1>because eve is often portrayed as the villain,</v>

85
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.420
<v Speaker 1>at least that's the theory,</v>

86
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

87
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.010
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

88
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.670
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

89
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.060
<v Speaker 1>if you regard the biblical stories as part of the patriarchal oppression,</v>

90
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.480
<v Speaker 1>centuries long patriarchal oppression and eve is the bad person who's erupted.</v>

91
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:49.210
<v Speaker 1>Mankind.</v>

92
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.450
<v Speaker 1>Madden has been severely,</v>

93
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.490
<v Speaker 1>it's complete rubbish because Adam shows his true colors in the second part in</v>

94
00:03:54.491 --> 00:03:59.491
<v Speaker 1>the story because as soon as God calls him who said that you were naked,</v>

95
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.150
<v Speaker 1>what does he mean?</v>

96
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.550
<v Speaker 1>He says he does two things.</v>

97
00:04:03.551 --> 00:04:04.384
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

98
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.760
<v Speaker 1>remember that the woman who made for me,</v>

99
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:08.410
<v Speaker 1>it's her fault.</v>

100
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.040
<v Speaker 1>And so that's perfect day because it doesn't take responsibility for his own</v>

101
00:04:12.041 --> 00:04:14.440
<v Speaker 1>action and Firstie Gladesville,</v>

102
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.800
<v Speaker 1>Wilbon and then Ian Lakes broad,</v>

103
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

104
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.990
<v Speaker 1>You might think that takes a fair bit of goal and then that's exactly right.</v>

105
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.610
<v Speaker 1>And this is relevant.</v>

106
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.180
<v Speaker 1>It's relevant because that's exactly what happened to this man in Toronto who</v>

107
00:04:30.281 --> 00:04:31.270
<v Speaker 1>killed all those people.</v>

108
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.160
<v Speaker 1>First thing he did because of his painful self consciousness as plain white men.</v>

109
00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.780
<v Speaker 1>And the second thing you did was bleeding a lot and the third was take his</v>

110
00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:41.614
<v Speaker 1>revenge.</v>

111
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.461
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

112
00:04:42.461 --> 00:04:43.990
<v Speaker 1>so that's the next story.</v>

113
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.500
<v Speaker 1>So God been very happy with this because now the structure of Ba is permanently</v>

114
00:04:51.581 --> 00:04:55.330
<v Speaker 1>disrupted by the emergence of self consciousness and their knowledge of death</v>

115
00:04:55.331 --> 00:04:57.670
<v Speaker 1>and the emergence of the knowledge of good and evil.</v>

116
00:04:57.671 --> 00:04:59.620
<v Speaker 1>It's like so much for that paradise,</v>

117
00:04:59.621 --> 00:05:00.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

118
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.630
<v Speaker 1>It's people have evolved beyond their childhood.</v>

119
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.570
<v Speaker 1>Harriet's same thing happens to the Buddha when he matures as fodder and links</v>

120
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:10.960
<v Speaker 1>in a walled city.</v>

121
00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.070
<v Speaker 1>It's all where there's no agent has no depth and there's no sickness and he</v>

122
00:05:15.071 --> 00:05:16.810
<v Speaker 1>grows up in there and everything's perfect,</v>

123
00:05:16.811 --> 00:05:20.740
<v Speaker 1>but it gets curious and he goes outside the walls of the city and the first</v>

124
00:05:20.741 --> 00:05:22.720
<v Speaker 1>thing he encounters is sickness.</v>

125
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.520
<v Speaker 1>And then he encounters old age and a different voyage in any encounters.</v>

126
00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.590
<v Speaker 1>And when he encounters get it never goes back inside the walled city,</v>

127
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:32.580
<v Speaker 1>his orders and eight,</v>

128
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.540
<v Speaker 1>four it's exactly the same idea.</v>

129
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.010
<v Speaker 1>So Alien,</v>

130
00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.110
<v Speaker 1>race and God as long now to take shop,</v>

131
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

132
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:39.520
<v Speaker 1>you've really done it.</v>

133
00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:41.260
<v Speaker 1>Here's what's going to happen.</v>

134
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.960
<v Speaker 1>You knew about the future and now you're going to have to work because as soon</v>

135
00:05:46.961 --> 00:05:48.100
<v Speaker 1>as you know about the future,</v>

136
00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:49.600
<v Speaker 1>then you have to work.</v>

137
00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.700
<v Speaker 1>Because even if things are going well now,</v>

138
00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:55.060
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean they're going to go well in a monk and you better get ready</v>

139
00:05:55.061 --> 00:05:55.894
<v Speaker 1>for that.</v>

140
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.320
<v Speaker 1>You better get ready for the then get ready for your old age,</v>

141
00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.960
<v Speaker 1>then get ready for the fact that you might get hill and so you're working on,</v>

142
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.870
<v Speaker 1>that's that human beings work.</v>

143
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.740
<v Speaker 1>We work because we're aware of the future.</v>

144
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.850
<v Speaker 1>He tells eve while you're in trouble too,</v>

145
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:12.800
<v Speaker 1>and I won't go into this in too much detail,</v>

146
00:06:12.801 --> 00:06:17.801
<v Speaker 1>but part of each trouble is that she's going to give birth to intelligence,</v>

147
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.190
<v Speaker 1>large skull and tiny dependent children,</v>

148
00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.060
<v Speaker 1>and they're going to tear her apart and shelter and she's going to have to be</v>

149
00:06:26.061 --> 00:06:27.020
<v Speaker 1>dependent on her husband.</v>

150
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:32.590
<v Speaker 1>And so those are the dual curses of whatever we get to wake up so well with the</v>

151
00:06:32.691 --> 00:06:32.961
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

152
00:06:32.961 --> 00:06:35.870
<v Speaker 1>And that's what history starts as far as the biblical stories are concerned.</v>
