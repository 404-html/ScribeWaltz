<v Speaker 1>Hi,</v>

2
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm currently going through a hard time as a first time mum was a nine month</v>

3
00:00:11.731 --> 00:00:12.330
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>

4
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.550
<v Speaker 1>I feel depressed and anxious and I'm highly neurotic.</v>

5
00:00:14.551 --> 00:00:15.384
<v Speaker 1>Invalid title.</v>

6
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.150
<v Speaker 1>Can you suggest anything to help me be a better mom?</v>

7
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:18.991
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

8
00:00:18.991 --> 00:00:19.261
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:19.261 --> 00:00:21.270
<v Speaker 1>lots of people have a hard time with,</v>

10
00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:22.200
<v Speaker 1>they're nine months old.</v>

11
00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:23.970
<v Speaker 1>I guess the first question would be,</v>

12
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.500
<v Speaker 1>are you getting enough sleep?</v>

13
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.760
<v Speaker 1>Do you have enough help?</v>

14
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.050
<v Speaker 1>Are you eating enough?</v>

15
00:00:28.051 --> 00:00:29.250
<v Speaker 1>Especially in the morning,</v>

16
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.050
<v Speaker 1>and you're going to feel highly neurotic and volatile to some degree because</v>

18
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.530
<v Speaker 1>while you've been through quite a physiological trauma and it's very demanding</v>

19
00:00:37.531 --> 00:00:39.300
<v Speaker 1>to have a newborn baby,</v>

20
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.620
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>

21
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.000
<v Speaker 1>the best thing I could say,</v>

22
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:42.840
<v Speaker 1>not knowing you,</v>

23
00:00:42.841 --> 00:00:46.500
<v Speaker 1>is to make sure that you have people around that you can talk to about your baby</v>

24
00:00:46.501 --> 00:00:51.501
<v Speaker 1>and that you can and that you can take a break when you need to and have someone</v>

25
00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:53.394
<v Speaker 1>spell you.</v>

26
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's often the role that a husband plays in the first year of,</v>

27
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.220
<v Speaker 1>of a baby's life is that he can,</v>

28
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.120
<v Speaker 1>he's supposed to watch the mother to make sure that she doesn't get overwhelmed</v>

29
00:01:03.121 --> 00:01:04.380
<v Speaker 1>by the demands of the baby.</v>

30
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.800
<v Speaker 1>And so I would hope that you're able to ask for support when you need it and not</v>

31
00:01:10.111 --> 00:01:11.670
<v Speaker 1>to be afraid of asking for support,</v>

32
00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:15.330
<v Speaker 1>especially to get arrest and to get something to eat because that's really</v>

33
00:01:15.331 --> 00:01:15.811
<v Speaker 1>important,</v>

34
00:01:15.811 --> 00:01:16.830
<v Speaker 1>especially in the morning.</v>

35
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:18.383
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

36
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.381
<v Speaker 1>other than that,</v>

37
00:01:19.381 --> 00:01:21.300
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell you anything really specific,</v>

38
00:01:21.301 --> 00:01:22.111
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately,</v>

39
00:01:22.111 --> 00:01:25.380
<v Speaker 1>given that I don't know anything about the specifics of your situation.</v>

40
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.873
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

41
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.650
<v Speaker 1>if it gets out of hand,</v>

42
00:01:28.651 --> 00:01:29.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.000
<v Speaker 1>you should go.</v>

44
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.190
<v Speaker 1>The other thing I should say is if it gets out of hand,</v>

45
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.360
<v Speaker 1>you should go speak with your,</v>

46
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.261
<v Speaker 1>with your doctor,</v>

47
00:01:34.261 --> 00:01:35.130
<v Speaker 1>with a professional,</v>

48
00:01:35.131 --> 00:01:37.940
<v Speaker 1>because you might have postpartum depression.</v>

49
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.260
<v Speaker 1>There's some dispute about whether that exists and as an independent diagnostic</v>

50
00:01:43.261 --> 00:01:43.681
<v Speaker 1>entity.</v>

51
00:01:43.681 --> 00:01:46.290
<v Speaker 1>But you can certainly be physiologically stressed.</v>

52
00:01:46.291 --> 00:01:48.660
<v Speaker 1>And if you have a predisposition to depression,</v>

53
00:01:48.661 --> 00:01:52.470
<v Speaker 1>then that kind of physiological stress and sleep disruption can bring it on.</v>

54
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.710
<v Speaker 1>So I would say if it really gets out of hand,</v>

55
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.090
<v Speaker 1>don't hesitate to go talk to someone professional.</v>

56
00:01:57.091 --> 00:01:57.830
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

57
00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:58.240
<v Speaker 1>It did.</v>

58
00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.710
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

59
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.070
<v Speaker 1>it may be necessary to do that because you don't want to fall too far down the</v>

60
00:02:02.071 --> 00:02:03.660
<v Speaker 1>hole and that's for sure.</v>
