00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.070
<v Speaker 1>So you believe that the dream could</v>
<v Speaker 1>contain more information then was yet</v>

2
00:00:07.081 --> 00:00:10.290
<v Speaker 1>articulated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think artists do the same thing?</v>

3
00:00:10.291 --> 00:00:13.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people go to museums and they look</v>

4
00:00:13.471 --> 00:00:15.840
<v Speaker 1>at paintings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>renaissance paintings or modern</v>

5
00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:18.210
<v Speaker 1>paintings and they don't exactly know</v>
<v Speaker 1>why they're there.</v>

6
00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.470
<v Speaker 1>Now I was in this room and in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember which museum,</v>

7
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.010
<v Speaker 1>but it was a room full of renaissance</v>
<v Speaker 1>art,</v>

8
00:00:26.011 --> 00:00:27.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great painters,</v>

9
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.140
<v Speaker 1>the greatest painters and thought maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>that room was worth $1 billion or</v>

10
00:00:31.141 --> 00:00:33.630
<v Speaker 1>something outrageous because there was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 20 paintings in there,</v>

11
00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:35.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so priceless.</v>

12
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.900
<v Speaker 1>And the first thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

13
00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:40.410
<v Speaker 1>why are those paintings worth so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>and why is there a museum in the biggest</v>

14
00:00:40.411 --> 00:00:43.410
<v Speaker 1>city in the world devoted to them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why do people from all over the</v>

15
00:00:43.411 --> 00:00:46.590
<v Speaker 1>world come and look at them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the hell are those people doing?</v>

16
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.870
<v Speaker 1>One of them was of the assumption of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mary,</v>

17
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautifully painted,</v>

18
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.780
<v Speaker 1>absolutely glowing work of art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like 20 people standing in front</v>

19
00:00:54.781 --> 00:00:57.510
<v Speaker 1>of it looking at it and think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are those people up to?</v>

20
00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.040
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know.</v>

21
00:00:59.041 --> 00:01:02.340
<v Speaker 1>Why did they make a pilgrimage to New</v>
<v Speaker 1>York to come and look at that painting?</v>

22
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.040
<v Speaker 1>It's not like they know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it worse so much?</v>

23
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know there's a status element to it</v>

24
00:01:06.961 --> 00:01:08.520
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that begs the question,</v>

25
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.640
<v Speaker 1>why did those items become such high</v>
<v Speaker 1>status items?</v>

26
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.640
<v Speaker 1>What is it about them that's so</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely remarkable?</v>

27
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're strange creatures.</v>
