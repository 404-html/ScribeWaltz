1
00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:07.371
<v Speaker 1>The problem is,</v>

2
00:00:07.371 --> 00:00:07.821
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>

3
00:00:07.821 --> 00:00:09.830
<v Speaker 1>this actually speaks to what people are like.</v>

4
00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:10.730
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:11.680
<v Speaker 1>benefit is fine.</v>

6
00:00:11.681 --> 00:00:12.800
<v Speaker 1>Like risk is infinite.</v>

7
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:14.683
<v Speaker 1>You can die.</v>

8
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:15.980
<v Speaker 1>You can only be so happy.</v>

9
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.881
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

10
00:00:16.881 --> 00:00:18.170
<v Speaker 1>like you can be really happy.</v>

11
00:00:18.171 --> 00:00:18.431
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

12
00:00:18.431 --> 00:00:18.920
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

13
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.920
<v Speaker 1>You can be like just 100% dead and you're actually kind of wired that way</v>

14
00:00:24.321 --> 00:00:29.321
<v Speaker 1>because people are more sensitive to negative events than deposit of events.</v>

15
00:00:29.601 --> 00:00:34.601
<v Speaker 1>So a loss will hurt you more than a gain of the same magnitude will please you.</v>

16
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.010
<v Speaker 1>So in that,</v>

17
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.770
<v Speaker 1>the reason I'm saying that is because it shows you that we're actually set up</v>

18
00:00:39.771 --> 00:00:40.820
<v Speaker 1>for a risky world.</v>

19
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.540
<v Speaker 1>Our nervous systems are tuned to be more sensitive to negative information</v>

20
00:00:44.541 --> 00:00:46.040
<v Speaker 1>because the world's so damn risky.</v>

21
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.900
<v Speaker 1>Now we'd be completely hiding like a nocturnal animal except that,</v>

22
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:51.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.490
<v Speaker 1>we figured out ways to</v>

24
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.280
<v Speaker 1>make risk value.</v>

25
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.190
<v Speaker 1>So we were ambivalent creatures.</v>

26
00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

27
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.570
<v Speaker 1>we were thrilled by opportunity to get terrified by it at the same time,</v>

28
00:01:02.571 --> 00:01:03.600
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what,</v>

29
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:04.723
<v Speaker 1>how it should be.</v>

30
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.520
<v Speaker 1>Risk is everywhere.</v>

31
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.830
<v Speaker 1>That's the first truth of Buddhism,</v>

32
00:01:09.831 --> 00:01:10.664
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

33
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.140
<v Speaker 1>Suffering is inevitable.</v>

34
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.220
<v Speaker 1>Life is suffering.</v>

35
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.880
<v Speaker 1>Same thing.</v>

36
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:14.720
<v Speaker 1>Risk is everywhere.</v>

37
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.673
<v Speaker 1>Life is suffering,</v>

38
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.873
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>

39
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:18.463
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

40
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:19.580
<v Speaker 1>partly when you're saying,</v>

41
00:01:19.581 --> 00:01:19.731
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

42
00:01:19.731 --> 00:01:22.220
<v Speaker 1>can you regulate the collapse of these macro systems?</v>

43
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.911
<v Speaker 1>You're saying,</v>

44
00:01:22.911 --> 00:01:23.071
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

45
00:01:23.071 --> 00:01:24.230
<v Speaker 1>can you eliminate risks?</v>

46
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.471
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

47
00:01:24.471 --> 00:01:25.280
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

48
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.113
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

49
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.081
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>

50
00:01:27.081 --> 00:01:27.710
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

51
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:28.580
<v Speaker 1>you could argue.</v>

52
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.531
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say that.</v>

53
00:01:30.531 --> 00:01:30.861
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

54
00:01:30.861 --> 00:01:33.230
<v Speaker 1>I think there is one way that you can minimize risk.</v>

55
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.970
<v Speaker 1>Don't be crooked.</v>

56
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.390
<v Speaker 1>The less crooked your society is,</v>

57
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.160
<v Speaker 1>the more you mitigate risks,</v>

58
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:41.720
<v Speaker 1>but you can't eliminate.</v>
