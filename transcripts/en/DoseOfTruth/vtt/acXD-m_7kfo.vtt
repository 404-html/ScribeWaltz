00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.220
You are very critical of postmodernism wave of the 60s isn't there a danger of

2
00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:14.220
throwing the baby out with the bath water?

3
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.120
Are the positive things about these movements at the moment?

4
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:18.870
No,

5
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:19.703
not really.

6
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.840
I don't think there's much positive about them at all.

7
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.490
I think they've gone way too far.

8
00:00:23.491 --> 00:00:25.290
I think they dominate the humanities.

9
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.800
The postmodernism mean the fact that the postmodernist point is that there is a

10
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.070
very large number of ways to interpret any closed set of phenomena,

11
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.791
something like that.

12
00:00:38.791 --> 00:00:40.110
Any limited set of phenomena.

13
00:00:40.111 --> 00:00:40.741
And that's true,

14
00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:41.551
but it's,

15
00:00:41.551 --> 00:00:42.390
it's shallow,

16
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.201
it's very,

17
00:00:43.201 --> 00:00:44.290
very shallow doctrine.

18
00:00:44.291 --> 00:00:45.124
And uh,

19
00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:46.290
if,

20
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.350
if I'm throwing the baby out with the bath water,

21
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.730
then it's a baby that needs to be thrown out at afraid.

22
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.830
Are the positive things about these movements?

23
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:53.723
Not at the moment.

24
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.070
I can't see anything positive about it.

25
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.353
I think it's,

26
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.260
it's degenerated into ideological clap trap and I think it's destroying the

27
00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:02.094
universities.

28
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.430
So the egalitarian waiver of the 60s that's a different issue I would say.

29
00:01:07.531 --> 00:01:12.531
I mean at mean I don't think it's reasonable to deny the utility of the civil

30
00:01:14.281 --> 00:01:15.990
rights movement in the 1960s,

31
00:01:15.991 --> 00:01:16.681
for example.

32
00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:17.130
And,

33
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.790
or,

34
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:18.210
and,

35
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.870
and,

36
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:19.111
you know,

37
00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:20.580
there were movements before that,

38
00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:23.580
like the labor movement that had real justification for being,

39
00:01:23.581 --> 00:01:27.030
it isn't that everything that always happens on the left is bad.

40
00:01:27.031 --> 00:01:28.140
I don't think that at all.

41
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.530
I think that the people who are,

42
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.820
let's say on the lower end of the economic distribution,

43
00:01:35.821 --> 00:01:37.770
need a powerful voice in politics.

44
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.993
Um,

45
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.070
I think that's only fair.

46
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.863
And I mean,

47
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.180
there is room for an egalitarian oriented he thoughts,

48
00:01:48.181 --> 00:01:50.430
but that isn't what equity is.

49
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.700
This has become completely ideological and there's just no,

50
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.700
there's just no excuse for it as far as I'm concerned.
