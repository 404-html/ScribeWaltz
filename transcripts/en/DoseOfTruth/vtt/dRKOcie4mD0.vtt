1
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:12.373
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:15.163
<v Speaker 1>Genuine,</v>

3
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.810
<v Speaker 1>genuinely giving her perspective or just arguing?</v>

4
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:23.480
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.320
<v Speaker 2>that's a good question.</v>

6
00:00:24.321 --> 00:00:24.921
<v Speaker 2>Let's see if we can,</v>

7
00:00:24.921 --> 00:00:26.360
<v Speaker 2>let's see if we can formulate that.</v>

8
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.913
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

9
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.440
<v Speaker 2>the first difference might be,</v>

10
00:00:30.441 --> 00:00:30.621
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

11
00:00:30.621 --> 00:00:30.921
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>

12
00:00:30.921 --> 00:00:32.510
<v Speaker 2>what's the outcome we're looking for?</v>

13
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.360
<v Speaker 2>Like let's,</v>

14
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.250
<v Speaker 2>let's think about that.</v>

15
00:00:34.251 --> 00:00:35.910
<v Speaker 2>Let's think about that in the context of,</v>

16
00:00:35.911 --> 00:00:36.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

17
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:37.610
<v Speaker 2>of an intimate relationship,</v>

18
00:00:37.611 --> 00:00:38.770
<v Speaker 2>a familial relationships.</v>

19
00:00:38.771 --> 00:00:39.680
<v Speaker 2>So you have a wife,</v>

20
00:00:39.681 --> 00:00:40.071
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

21
00:00:40.071 --> 00:00:41.450
<v Speaker 2>and you've got some kids just wonder,</v>

22
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.971
<v Speaker 2>what are you up,</v>

23
00:00:41.971 --> 00:00:42.804
<v Speaker 2>dude?</v>

24
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:43.693
<v Speaker 2>What do you want?</v>

25
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:46.753
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully.</v>

26
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.971
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

27
00:00:47.971 --> 00:00:48.950
<v Speaker 2>So that's one thing we're,</v>

28
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.950
<v Speaker 2>so that we're trying to establish the domain of the year.</v>

29
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.400
<v Speaker 2>We're going to,</v>

30
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.720
<v Speaker 2>we're going to try to make things better.</v>

31
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.250
<v Speaker 2>What would better look like?</v>

32
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:57.713
<v Speaker 1>You think</v>

33
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.820
<v Speaker 1>you could try a little bit my name,</v>

34
00:01:01.821 --> 00:01:03.500
<v Speaker 1>whatever negative emotion I can feel like.</v>

35
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.461
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

36
00:01:04.461 --> 00:01:04.721
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

37
00:01:04.721 --> 00:01:05.720
<v Speaker 2>so there's something,</v>

38
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:06.021
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

39
00:01:06.021 --> 00:01:07.660
<v Speaker 2>So that's a rough area of presupposition.</v>

40
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.280
<v Speaker 2>Is that part of what you're doing when you're making things better is to</v>

41
00:01:10.281 --> 00:01:14.750
<v Speaker 2>decrease the probability that negative emotion will arise short term or long</v>

42
00:01:14.751 --> 00:01:15.584
<v Speaker 2>term?</v>

43
00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:18.401
<v Speaker 1>Short term.</v>

44
00:01:18.401 --> 00:01:19.234
<v Speaker 1>First.</v>

45
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.800
<v Speaker 1>That's what bothering me.</v>

46
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.620
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

47
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:22.111
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

48
00:01:22.111 --> 00:01:26.340
<v Speaker 2>So that's an interesting thing because what if you have to experience a</v>

49
00:01:26.341 --> 00:01:29.610
<v Speaker 2>tremendous amount of short term pain in order to make long term progress?</v>

50
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.550
<v Speaker 1>If it's different from the pain that initially got me thinking about it seems</v>

51
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.300
<v Speaker 1>like an improvement potentially.</v>

52
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.953
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

53
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:39.543
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

54
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.360
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

55
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.193
<v Speaker 1>Well</v>

56
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to address your question completely from a ps Yeti and perspective,</v>

57
00:01:46.071 --> 00:01:48.260
<v Speaker 2>but that's okay because it works for Rogers as well.</v>

58
00:01:48.261 --> 00:01:49.730
<v Speaker 2>It's just easier to explain</v>

59
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.220
<v Speaker 2>freedom from unnecessary suffering</v>

60
00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.951
<v Speaker 2>in the short,</v>

61
00:01:57.951 --> 00:01:58.341
<v Speaker 2>medium,</v>

62
00:01:58.341 --> 00:02:03.230
<v Speaker 2>and long term across as many people as you can imagine manage.</v>

63
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:04.880
<v Speaker 2>So we'll say,</v>

64
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.170
<v Speaker 2>let's start with you and your family.</v>

65
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:07.131
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

66
00:02:07.131 --> 00:02:08.240
<v Speaker 2>how are you going to do that?</v>

67
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:09.523
<v Speaker 2>You don't know.</v>

68
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.570
<v Speaker 2>That's what you have to talk about.</v>

69
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.823
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

70
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.020
<v Speaker 2>But you cannot have that conversation until you've got that framework.</v>

71
00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.561
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

72
00:02:17.561 --> 00:02:18.940
<v Speaker 2>So it's very,</v>

73
00:02:18.941 --> 00:02:22.240
<v Speaker 2>very tricky because in the midst of the argument,</v>

74
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.900
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be tremendous temptation to oppress and deceive and humiliate</v>

75
00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.010
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

76
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.870
<v Speaker 2>and treat with contempt and hurt and punish and threatened all of those things.</v>

77
00:02:34.871 --> 00:02:35.440
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

78
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.940
<v Speaker 2>And that that's partly reactivity in the short term and then it's not,</v>

79
00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.950
<v Speaker 2>that's not properly integrated into the overarching hierarchical structure.</v>

80
00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.900
<v Speaker 2>So you've got to keep bringing yourself back to that.</v>

81
00:02:46.901 --> 00:02:47.620
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

82
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.690
<v Speaker 2>why should you control your impulses?</v>

83
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.003
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

84
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.040
<v Speaker 2>because their manifestation in the present,</v>

85
00:02:54.041 --> 00:02:57.040
<v Speaker 2>they're spontaneous and impulsive manifestation in the present.</v>

86
00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.941
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

87
00:02:57.941 --> 00:02:58.840
<v Speaker 2>although that may be,</v>

88
00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.190
<v Speaker 2>it may carry with it a feeling of freedom and power,</v>

89
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.990
<v Speaker 2>maybe destroying the very structured that's going to provide you with peace and</v>

90
00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:13.120
<v Speaker 2>stability over the medium and long run.</v>

91
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.801
<v Speaker 2>So it's again,</v>

92
00:03:14.801 --> 00:03:16.150
<v Speaker 2>it's the idea of contradiction.</v>

93
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:17.703
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

94
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.360
<v Speaker 2>if we're having a discussion,</v>

95
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.780
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

96
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:20.613
<v Speaker 2>so let's say,</v>

97
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:21.340
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

98
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.130
<v Speaker 2>we'll do this in a very local fashion.</v>

99
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.053
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

100
00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:29.813
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

101
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.630
<v Speaker 2>well let's say you're having a discussion about with your partner about who's</v>

102
00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:35.740
<v Speaker 2>going to cook dinner.</v>

103
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.203
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

104
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:39.820
<v Speaker 2>You think that's a simple discussion.</v>

105
00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:41.450
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's not a simple discussion.</v>

106
00:03:41.451 --> 00:03:42.590
<v Speaker 2>It's a horrible discussion.</v>

107
00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.880
<v Speaker 2>It's where the war between the genders manifests itself.</v>

108
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.140
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the places.</v>

109
00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:49.370
<v Speaker 2>And to solve it,</v>

110
00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:50.840
<v Speaker 2>did he not?</v>

111
00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.900
<v Speaker 2>You actually have to solve the war between the genders.</v>

112
00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.261
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

113
00:03:54.261 --> 00:03:56.720
<v Speaker 2>good luck with doc and there it is right in your house.</v>

114
00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:57.230
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

115
00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.610
<v Speaker 2>It's like a snake in the garden.</v>

116
00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:59.900
<v Speaker 2>There's no getting rid of it.</v>

117
00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.441
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

118
00:04:00.441 --> 00:04:01.340
<v Speaker 2>So then you might think,</v>

119
00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:01.551
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

120
00:04:01.551 --> 00:04:02.750
<v Speaker 2>what's our aim for dinner?</v>

121
00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:04.700
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

122
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:05.780
<v Speaker 2>do we want to have wretched,</v>

123
00:04:05.781 --> 00:04:06.321
<v Speaker 2>miserable,</v>

124
00:04:06.321 --> 00:04:11.321
<v Speaker 2>rotten foods served by a resentful person to a bunch of ungrateful rats who</v>

125
00:04:11.601 --> 00:04:13.250
<v Speaker 2>complained and sniffle?</v>

126
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.233
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

127
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.990
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

128
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:16.160
<v Speaker 2>let's assume we don't want,</v>

129
00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.180
<v Speaker 2>we don't want that.</v>

130
00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.511
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

131
00:04:17.511 --> 00:04:17.781
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

132
00:04:17.781 --> 00:04:18.614
<v Speaker 2>Well we've got,</v>

133
00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.450
<v Speaker 2>you know what we're not aiming at.</v>

134
00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.950
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

135
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:21.783
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

136
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:22.633
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

137
00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.350
<v Speaker 2>who should cook dinner and when and what are the rules by which we decide that?</v>

138
00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:29.330
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

139
00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.790
<v Speaker 2>That's a tough one because you can return to roles,</v>

140
00:04:31.791 --> 00:04:32.270
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

141
00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.780
<v Speaker 2>That's what you,</v>

142
00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.100
<v Speaker 2>that's why people have roles.</v>

143
00:04:34.101 --> 00:04:36.290
<v Speaker 2>So they don't have to have stupid conversations like this,</v>

144
00:04:36.291 --> 00:04:37.490
<v Speaker 2>but that time is gone.</v>

145
00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:38.121
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

146
00:04:38.121 --> 00:04:40.460
<v Speaker 2>So what do you do when there's no role?</v>

147
00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.451
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

148
00:04:41.451 --> 00:04:42.770
<v Speaker 2>I could make you do it.</v>

149
00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.840
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you know,</v>

150
00:04:44.841 --> 00:04:45.141
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>

151
00:04:45.141 --> 00:04:48.530
<v Speaker 2>I could either do it physically by force or I could just intimidate you or I</v>

152
00:04:48.531 --> 00:04:50.720
<v Speaker 2>could make life miserable for you if you don't do it.</v>

153
00:04:50.721 --> 00:04:51.081
<v Speaker 2>Or you know,</v>

154
00:04:51.081 --> 00:04:52.000
<v Speaker 2>there's lots of ways of,</v>

155
00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.970
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

156
00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.110
<v Speaker 2>of using power.</v>

157
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.500
<v Speaker 2>Problem with that is you're not worthy.</v>

158
00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.940
<v Speaker 2>You're not without your own book.</v>

159
00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:59.803
<v Speaker 2>What happens?</v>

160
00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.930
<v Speaker 2>And for every step I take towards making you miserable,</v>

161
00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.490
<v Speaker 2>you'll get your chance.</v>

162
00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.320
<v Speaker 2>So probably we don't want to use force plus that's not so good for the kids.</v>

163
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.940
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

164
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.080
<v Speaker 2>from a role model perspective and hypothetically,</v>

165
00:05:12.081 --> 00:05:14.060
<v Speaker 2>we want good things to be happening to them.</v>

166
00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.640
<v Speaker 2>So tyranny looks like it's out.</v>

167
00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.830
<v Speaker 2>And I don't want you to subjugate yourself because maybe like maybe you're very</v>

168
00:05:21.831 --> 00:05:22.371
<v Speaker 2>agreeable,</v>

169
00:05:22.371 --> 00:05:25.820
<v Speaker 2>let's say that because that's often a problem in communication between men and</v>

170
00:05:25.821 --> 00:05:26.300
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>

171
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.390
<v Speaker 2>The guys more disagreeable then the woman is.</v>

172
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:33.200
<v Speaker 2>And so if he like Jack Suck the level of conflict,</v>

173
00:05:33.201 --> 00:05:36.500
<v Speaker 2>show back off because she doesn't like conflict for all sorts of different</v>

174
00:05:36.501 --> 00:05:37.280
<v Speaker 2>reasons.</v>

175
00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.680
<v Speaker 2>So that's another way of winning.</v>

176
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.910
<v Speaker 2>Except then the person who loses his all resentful and you end up with,</v>

177
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.391
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

178
00:05:44.391 --> 00:05:44.841
<v Speaker 2>horrible,</v>

179
00:05:44.841 --> 00:05:49.841
<v Speaker 2>miserable food fed two warring partners who are complaining in and struggling.</v>

180
00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:52.790
<v Speaker 2>It's not a good solution.</v>

181
00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.721
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

182
00:05:53.721 --> 00:05:55.280
<v Speaker 2>So then what you're left with,</v>

183
00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.133
<v Speaker 2>well then you've gotten,</v>

184
00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:59.001
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

185
00:05:59.001 --> 00:05:59.900
<v Speaker 2>so I might say,</v>

186
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.321
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

187
00:06:00.321 --> 00:06:02.450
<v Speaker 2>do we agree that we need to have dinner?</v>

188
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:03.621
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

189
00:06:03.621 --> 00:06:03.831
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

190
00:06:03.831 --> 00:06:04.371
<v Speaker 2>when you might think,</v>

191
00:06:04.371 --> 00:06:04.671
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

192
00:06:04.671 --> 00:06:05.870
<v Speaker 2>well we could agree on that.</v>

193
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.690
<v Speaker 2>How often should we have it at home?</v>

194
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.720
<v Speaker 2>Well that's going to require a fair bit of thought.</v>

195
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.880
<v Speaker 2>You want to go out now and then how often,</v>

196
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.110
<v Speaker 2>how much is that going to cost?</v>

197
00:06:15.111 --> 00:06:15.901
<v Speaker 2>What are we going to span?</v>

198
00:06:15.901 --> 00:06:16.940
<v Speaker 2>Where are we going to go?</v>

199
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.930
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

200
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:18.830
<v Speaker 2>who pays?</v>

201
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.791
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

202
00:06:19.791 --> 00:06:21.860
<v Speaker 2>so that's going to be like a whole conversation.</v>

203
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.300
<v Speaker 2>So let's say we figured that out.</v>

204
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.430
<v Speaker 2>It's like five days a week we're going to stay home.</v>

205
00:06:25.431 --> 00:06:25.641
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

206
00:06:25.641 --> 00:06:26.510
<v Speaker 2>who's going to occur?</v>

207
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.770
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

208
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:28.760
<v Speaker 2>do you like cooking?</v>

209
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:30.733
<v Speaker 2>Do I like cooking?</v>

210
00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:31.820
<v Speaker 2>Not something to sort out.</v>

211
00:06:31.821 --> 00:06:32.654
<v Speaker 2>So that would be,</v>

212
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.940
<v Speaker 2>that's like a little</v>

213
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.170
<v Speaker 2>discussion with your own physiology in some sense.</v>

214
00:06:39.171 --> 00:06:39.381
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

215
00:06:39.381 --> 00:06:42.260
<v Speaker 2>what's your felt state while you're preparing the food?</v>

216
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.430
<v Speaker 2>And maybe he'll say,</v>

217
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:44.773
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

218
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:46.670
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>

219
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:47.271
<v Speaker 2>I'll cook the,</v>

220
00:06:47.271 --> 00:06:47.540
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

221
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:48.020
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

222
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.020
<v Speaker 2>if there's someone in the kitchen with me and uh,</v>

223
00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:51.651
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

224
00:06:51.651 --> 00:06:53.720
<v Speaker 2>someone else cleans up afterwards.</v>

225
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:55.003
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

226
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:57.710
<v Speaker 2>then it turns out that I don't mind cooking while,</v>

227
00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:58.551
<v Speaker 2>and then you might say,</v>

228
00:06:58.551 --> 00:06:58.880
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

229
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.790
<v Speaker 2>is not minding good enough or do you really want to enjoy it?</v>

230
00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:02.421
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

231
00:07:02.421 --> 00:07:03.470
<v Speaker 2>what's the preconditions?</v>

232
00:07:03.471 --> 00:07:06.560
<v Speaker 2>What preconditions would have to be met for you to enjoy it.</v>

233
00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:08.450
<v Speaker 2>While you want to think about that,</v>

234
00:07:08.451 --> 00:07:09.950
<v Speaker 2>because if you can get the person,</v>

235
00:07:09.951 --> 00:07:10.611
<v Speaker 2>either of you,</v>

236
00:07:10.611 --> 00:07:12.860
<v Speaker 2>who the hell cares to enjoy that,</v>

237
00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:14.300
<v Speaker 2>then it's sort of self sustaining,</v>

238
00:07:14.301 --> 00:07:14.511
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

239
00:07:14.511 --> 00:07:18.230
<v Speaker 2>You put that into place and then the thing runs smoothly across multiple</v>

240
00:07:18.231 --> 00:07:19.100
<v Speaker 2>iterations.</v>

241
00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:20.420
<v Speaker 2>And so then you might think,</v>

242
00:07:20.421 --> 00:07:25.370
<v Speaker 2>well what are the preconditions for us to do that in a way that would be joyful</v>

243
00:07:25.371 --> 00:07:25.880
<v Speaker 2>that say,</v>

244
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:26.270
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

245
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:27.051
<v Speaker 2>well that's a high,</v>

246
00:07:27.051 --> 00:07:27.950
<v Speaker 2>that's a high bar.</v>

247
00:07:27.951 --> 00:07:28.490
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

248
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:29.323
<v Speaker 2>well</v>

249
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:32.570
<v Speaker 2>one or the other,</v>

250
00:07:32.571 --> 00:07:35.360
<v Speaker 2>but should learn to cook because otherwise we're going to eat and like,</v>

251
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:35.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

252
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:40.490
<v Speaker 2>canned spaghetti or some other sort of horror and that's not very high quality.</v>

253
00:07:40.491 --> 00:07:42.140
<v Speaker 2>So that problem might have to be solved.</v>

254
00:07:42.141 --> 00:07:45.170
<v Speaker 2>And then there's the problem of how you react to the person when they cook.</v>

255
00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:45.770
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

256
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:48.950
<v Speaker 2>like do you just assume that that's their bloody responsibility and if they</v>

257
00:07:48.951 --> 00:07:49.761
<v Speaker 2>don't live up to it,</v>

258
00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:50.720
<v Speaker 2>there's something wrong with them?</v>

259
00:07:50.721 --> 00:07:55.520
<v Speaker 2>Or do you notice what they're doing and express some appreciation and gratitude</v>

260
00:07:55.521 --> 00:07:59.420
<v Speaker 2>and and in a way that would increase the probability that would happen again,</v>

261
00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:00.590
<v Speaker 2>that'd be a better solution.</v>

262
00:08:00.591 --> 00:08:03.800
<v Speaker 2>So then you have to negotiate about how you're going to do that.</v>

263
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:04.730
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

264
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.310
<v Speaker 2>Maybe even right down to the level of words,</v>

265
00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:09.480
<v Speaker 2>but what you're sir,</v>

266
00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:10.191
<v Speaker 2>see what you're,</v>

267
00:08:10.191 --> 00:08:12.620
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to serve a higher order by doing that,</v>

268
00:08:12.621 --> 00:08:13.160
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

269
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.000
<v Speaker 2>You're trying to,</v>

270
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:18.140
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to satisfy basic organismal needs,</v>

271
00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.210
<v Speaker 2>the provision of food.</v>

272
00:08:20.211 --> 00:08:20.571
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>

273
00:08:20.571 --> 00:08:22.910
<v Speaker 2>food is complicated for human beings because we just don't,</v>

274
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:26.300
<v Speaker 2>you just don't put dog food in the bowl and chow down.</v>

275
00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.670
<v Speaker 2>Even dogs won't do that.</v>

276
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.790
<v Speaker 2>Our dog won't eat less.</v>

277
00:08:28.791 --> 00:08:29.624
<v Speaker 2>We're eating,</v>

278
00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:30.231
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

279
00:08:30.231 --> 00:08:33.590
<v Speaker 2>so human beings are extremely social leaders,</v>

280
00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:36.620
<v Speaker 2>so you have to get that right and so,</v>

281
00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:41.630
<v Speaker 2>but the conversation will only take place in the proper manner if your</v>

282
00:08:41.631 --> 00:08:44.300
<v Speaker 2>orientation is proper in the,</v>

283
00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:45.980
<v Speaker 2>during the conversation.</v>

284
00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:47.540
<v Speaker 2>And the orientation needs to be,</v>

285
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:52.160
<v Speaker 2>how can we make this better for both of us in the long run and for the people</v>

286
00:08:52.161 --> 00:08:54.920
<v Speaker 2>around us and that you have to bow down before that.</v>

287
00:08:54.921 --> 00:08:56.940
<v Speaker 2>In some sense as the highest,</v>

288
00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.090
<v Speaker 2>highest order principle that you're serving.</v>

289
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:03.000
<v Speaker 2>And then you can stumble around trying to work that out.</v>

290
00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:03.811
<v Speaker 2>And then you might say,</v>

291
00:09:03.811 --> 00:09:08.400
<v Speaker 2>well you cook three times a week and I cooked twice and I'll take care of it</v>

292
00:09:08.401 --> 00:09:09.234
<v Speaker 2>once.</v>

293
00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:13.020
<v Speaker 2>And then of course you have to get the whole grocery thing settled out and</v>

294
00:09:13.021 --> 00:09:15.570
<v Speaker 2>that's a whole other bloody complicated conversation,</v>

295
00:09:15.571 --> 00:09:16.800
<v Speaker 2>but it needs to be done.</v>

296
00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:18.061
<v Speaker 2>And then you might say,</v>

297
00:09:18.061 --> 00:09:18.181
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

298
00:09:18.181 --> 00:09:22.320
<v Speaker 2>let's run this for a couple of weeks and we'll see how it goes and then we can</v>

299
00:09:22.321 --> 00:09:24.720
<v Speaker 2>meet again and we can discuss what worked and what didn't.</v>

300
00:09:24.721 --> 00:09:27.540
<v Speaker 2>And the goal is to make it better,</v>

301
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:29.520
<v Speaker 2>make it better and make it better and make it better.</v>

302
00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:32.220
<v Speaker 2>And then no one's trying to win.</v>

303
00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:33.301
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

304
00:09:33.301 --> 00:09:36.180
<v Speaker 2>it depends on what you mean by when I'm not trying to defeat you,</v>

305
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:38.100
<v Speaker 2>why we'll have to live with you.</v>

306
00:09:38.101 --> 00:09:39.180
<v Speaker 2>That'd be the first reasons.</v>

307
00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:39.391
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

308
00:09:39.391 --> 00:09:40.740
<v Speaker 2>what the hell good is it defeating you?</v>

309
00:09:40.741 --> 00:09:42.810
<v Speaker 2>Unless I want someone 100 around like this,</v>

310
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:43.231
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

311
00:09:43.231 --> 00:09:44.460
<v Speaker 2>resentful and bitter.</v>

312
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:45.750
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I do want that,</v>

313
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:49.470
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think that's a very good place to start.</v>

314
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:52.170
<v Speaker 2>So when you have a client come in to see you,</v>

315
00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:53.970
<v Speaker 2>the rule is,</v>

316
00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.330
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you the rules I used cause they're Rogerian.</v>

317
00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:58.943
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

318
00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.140
<v Speaker 2>I will tell the person what I think.</v>

319
00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.610
<v Speaker 2>So I won't tell them that what I think is right.</v>

320
00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.740
<v Speaker 2>But if they're doing something and I,</v>

321
00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:12.750
<v Speaker 2>I have a reaction to that of some sort that'll usually express itself in a</v>

322
00:10:12.751 --> 00:10:13.770
<v Speaker 2>fantasy or a thought.</v>

323
00:10:13.771 --> 00:10:15.360
<v Speaker 2>And I'll just tell them what happened.</v>

324
00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:16.471
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

325
00:10:16.471 --> 00:10:21.360
<v Speaker 2>I tried to do it as gently as I possibly can because you can use the truth as a</v>

326
00:10:21.361 --> 00:10:22.050
<v Speaker 2>club,</v>

327
00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:23.490
<v Speaker 2>but then that's not the truth.</v>

328
00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:28.380
<v Speaker 2>And then at least they get the honest response of one person to what they're</v>

329
00:10:28.381 --> 00:10:29.214
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

330
00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:30.180
<v Speaker 2>And I'll tell you,</v>

331
00:10:30.181 --> 00:10:33.810
<v Speaker 2>I've seen lots of people who've never got the honest response of any one person</v>

332
00:10:33.811 --> 00:10:35.730
<v Speaker 2>ever in their whole life to what their life.</v>

333
00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:39.150
<v Speaker 2>And so they have no idea what they're like or what's annoying other people or</v>

334
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:41.430
<v Speaker 2>how they should behave or any of those things.</v>

335
00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:42.061
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

336
00:10:42.061 --> 00:10:43.570
<v Speaker 2>even though I'm not going to be right,</v>

337
00:10:43.571 --> 00:10:44.404
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

338
00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:49.760
<v Speaker 2>in that my reactions won't be a precisely accurate representation of the average</v>

339
00:10:50.401 --> 00:10:51.930
<v Speaker 2>response of other people,</v>

340
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.030
<v Speaker 2>which is basically what you're trying to model.</v>

341
00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.580
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be a lot better than they've had so far.</v>

342
00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.390
<v Speaker 2>And then now than precondition is you're going to try really hard to get</v>

343
00:11:00.391 --> 00:11:01.320
<v Speaker 2>yourself together,</v>

344
00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:02.250
<v Speaker 2>whatever that means.</v>

345
00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:05.490
<v Speaker 2>We're going to talk about whatever that means and I'm going to support you in</v>

346
00:11:05.491 --> 00:11:06.324
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

347
00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:07.680
<v Speaker 2>And that's our goal.</v>

348
00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:12.840
<v Speaker 2>And that that's a variant of Rogerian unconditional positive regard.</v>

349
00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.100
<v Speaker 2>And his,</v>

350
00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.560
<v Speaker 2>his unconditional positive regard in some sense was,</v>

351
00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:18.840
<v Speaker 2>was the setup for the therapy.</v>

352
00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.600
<v Speaker 2>So the presupposition is your valuable,</v>

353
00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.810
<v Speaker 2>although maybe you're a little on the bent and twisted side,</v>

354
00:11:24.811 --> 00:11:25.540
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

355
00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:28.920
<v Speaker 2>maybe you could be straightened up into something that's like deadly.</v>

356
00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.090
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

357
00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:33.300
<v Speaker 2>we're going to start with that presupposition and we're going to learn on the</v>

358
00:11:33.301 --> 00:11:34.020
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

359
00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:34.680
<v Speaker 2>But that's what,</v>

360
00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:35.513
<v Speaker 2>that's what we're,</v>

361
00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:36.690
<v Speaker 2>that's what we're doing that,</v>

362
00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:40.110
<v Speaker 2>so the unconditional positive regard,</v>

363
00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:44.610
<v Speaker 2>it's like a human rights thinking because the basis of the idea of human rights</v>

364
00:11:44.611 --> 00:11:45.810
<v Speaker 2>is that people are valuable.</v>

365
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:47.850
<v Speaker 2>They have some intrinsic value,</v>

366
00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:48.901
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

367
00:11:48.901 --> 00:11:49.470
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

368
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:50.010
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

369
00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:52.770
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe it's PR,</v>

370
00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:56.230
<v Speaker 2>it's reasonable to presuppose that from the Reef Raj area perspective is that</v>

371
00:11:56.231 --> 00:11:59.290
<v Speaker 2>what's valuable about you as you're being right?</v>

372
00:11:59.291 --> 00:12:00.190
<v Speaker 2>You're a conscious,</v>

373
00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:02.500
<v Speaker 2>you're a locus of experience.</v>

374
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:03.880
<v Speaker 2>And as such,</v>

375
00:12:03.881 --> 00:12:05.770
<v Speaker 2>here are unique locus of experience.</v>

376
00:12:05.771 --> 00:12:06.431
<v Speaker 2>And as such,</v>

377
00:12:06.431 --> 00:12:06.910
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

378
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:09.820
<v Speaker 2>you have something to contribute that no one else can contribute.</v>

379
00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:11.620
<v Speaker 2>And that that's valuable.</v>

380
00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.360
<v Speaker 2>It's intrinsically valuable.</v>

381
00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:16.180
<v Speaker 2>That's the basic presupposition of the idea of human rights,</v>

382
00:12:16.181 --> 00:12:17.014
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>

383
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:20.020
<v Speaker 2>So if that's acted out in the therapeutic session,</v>

384
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:22.120
<v Speaker 2>but it's acted out in any relationship,</v>

385
00:12:22.121 --> 00:12:22.900
<v Speaker 2>that's therapeutic.</v>
