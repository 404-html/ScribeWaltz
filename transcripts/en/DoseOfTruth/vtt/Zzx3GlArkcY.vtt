1
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:07.793
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.900
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that,</v>

4
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:15.080
<v Speaker 1>that people have pointed out over the last year is that I'm better,</v>

5
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.110
<v Speaker 1>let's say when I'm less angry and some of that is poor health am I helped,</v>

6
00:00:21.291 --> 00:00:22.124
<v Speaker 1>has been,</v>

7
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.040
<v Speaker 1>I've had periods of very bad health in the last year,</v>

8
00:00:25.041 --> 00:00:26.390
<v Speaker 1>like dreadfully bad for,</v>

9
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.470
<v Speaker 1>for months on end.</v>

10
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.320
<v Speaker 1>And although that seems to have resolved itself,</v>

11
00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:31.154
<v Speaker 1>thank God,</v>

12
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.320
<v Speaker 1>knock on wood and all of that,</v>

13
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:34.490
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

14
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.490
<v Speaker 1>I do know that you're not a master of a serious topic until you can handle it</v>

15
00:00:39.561 --> 00:00:40.270
<v Speaker 1>with play,</v>

16
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.450
<v Speaker 1>the fullness and lightness and that that goes for even the most serious of</v>

17
00:00:44.451 --> 00:00:44.961
<v Speaker 1>topics.</v>

18
00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:49.961
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that I would hope is that I can keep my head more</v>

19
00:00:49.971 --> 00:00:54.971
<v Speaker 1>effectively in the next year and let some of this roll off my back and not</v>

20
00:00:55.641 --> 00:00:56.480
<v Speaker 1>respond quite.</v>

21
00:00:56.481 --> 00:00:57.314
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

22
00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.070
<v Speaker 1>What would you say fit viciously?</v>

23
00:01:01.071 --> 00:01:01.904
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

24
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.983
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's it.</v>

25
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:03.471
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

26
00:01:03.471 --> 00:01:03.651
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

27
00:01:03.651 --> 00:01:05.630
<v Speaker 1>there's common English common law rule,</v>

28
00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:07.430
<v Speaker 1>which I write about in 12 rules of life,</v>

29
00:01:07.431 --> 00:01:10.520
<v Speaker 1>which is that you're not supposed to respond with any more forced than</v>

30
00:01:10.521 --> 00:01:11.354
<v Speaker 1>necessary.</v>

31
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.050
<v Speaker 1>And I think that there have been times in the last year that I've responded with</v>

32
00:01:15.051 --> 00:01:16.670
<v Speaker 1>more force than was necessary.</v>

33
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.230
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't easy to tell,</v>

34
00:01:18.231 --> 00:01:18.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.190
<v Speaker 1>because sometimes the forces that were brought them to bear on me seem quite</v>

36
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.923
<v Speaker 1>intimidating,</v>

37
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.910
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

38
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.570
<v Speaker 1>it's an art to respond judiciously.</v>

39
00:01:29.571 --> 00:01:33.350
<v Speaker 1>And so hopefully I can learn how to do that better in the upcoming year.</v>

40
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.140
<v Speaker 2>But tabbing lived,</v>

41
00:01:35.141 --> 00:01:35.591
<v Speaker 2>breathed,</v>

42
00:01:35.591 --> 00:01:38.980
<v Speaker 2>and worked with a feminist and radical leftist Marxists,</v>

43
00:01:38.981 --> 00:01:40.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>

44
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.780
<v Speaker 2>being mellow and calm with them doesn't work.</v>

45
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.520
<v Speaker 2>And they're almost like,</v>

46
00:01:45.521 --> 00:01:46.420
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

47
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.961
<v Speaker 2>what am I going to say?</v>

48
00:01:46.961 --> 00:01:49.090
<v Speaker 2>A pack of wolves at times the way they attack.</v>

49
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.151
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

50
00:01:50.151 --> 00:01:50.871
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing,</v>

51
00:01:50.871 --> 00:01:51.041
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

52
00:01:51.041 --> 00:01:51.741
<v Speaker 1>it's harder.</v>

53
00:01:51.741 --> 00:01:56.741
<v Speaker 1>It's harder under conditions of mob attack to remain cool and to remain and to</v>

54
00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.160
<v Speaker 1>retain your head.</v>

55
00:01:58.161 --> 00:01:59.030
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

56
00:01:59.031 --> 00:02:00.410
<v Speaker 1>when I was at McMaster,</v>

57
00:02:00.411 --> 00:02:02.060
<v Speaker 1>which was probably the most</v>

58
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.270
<v Speaker 1>extreme demonstration against me,</v>

59
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.800
<v Speaker 1>I was able to stay calm and that really was useful.</v>

60
00:02:12.801 --> 00:02:14.210
<v Speaker 1>It was unbelievably useful.</v>

61
00:02:14.211 --> 00:02:15.650
<v Speaker 1>It was the right way to handle that.</v>

62
00:02:15.651 --> 00:02:17.450
<v Speaker 1>And so I just have to,</v>

63
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.981
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

64
00:02:18.981 --> 00:02:21.380
<v Speaker 1>in not being ill helps a lot too because you know,</v>

65
00:02:21.381 --> 00:02:22.640
<v Speaker 1>if your health is compromised,</v>

66
00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:24.140
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot more,</v>

67
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.380
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot easier to be touchy and,</v>

68
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.260
<v Speaker 1>and also to make errors in judgment.</v>

69
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.830
<v Speaker 1>And so hopefully I'll be back on both feet for the next year.</v>

70
00:02:38.271 --> 00:02:42.500
<v Speaker 1>That would be a good thing and won't be inclined to make errors because of</v>

71
00:02:42.501 --> 00:02:43.334
<v Speaker 1>fatigue or,</v>

72
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.330
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

73
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.163
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

74
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.100
<v Speaker 2>will you be tweeting from Europe then putting up your videos for all of us who</v>

75
00:02:49.101 --> 00:02:52.880
<v Speaker 2>will miss you so much here and we want to keep up to date on what you're doing</v>

76
00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:53.780
<v Speaker 2>and what you're working on.</v>

77
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.200
<v Speaker 1>I want to stay on top of my youtube channel and the podcasts and all of that,</v>

78
00:02:58.201 --> 00:02:59.790
<v Speaker 1>so I'll definitely be doing that.</v>

79
00:02:59.791 --> 00:03:00.060
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
