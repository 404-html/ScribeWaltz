00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:07.900
<v Speaker 1>Paul maloney asks you,</v>

2
00:00:07.901 --> 00:00:10.780
<v Speaker 1>edited out a disagreement with Camille Paglia,</v>

3
00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:11.560
<v Speaker 1>what was it?</v>

4
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.393
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:12.790
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

6
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:13.810
<v Speaker 1>that's not the case.</v>

7
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.220
<v Speaker 1>There was a piece edited out,</v>

8
00:00:15.221 --> 00:00:17.170
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't because there was a disagreement,</v>

9
00:00:17.171 --> 00:00:20.260
<v Speaker 1>it was because there was some glitch in the video or something like that.</v>

10
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.180
<v Speaker 1>Generally speaking,</v>

11
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.961
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

12
00:00:22.961 --> 00:00:24.820
<v Speaker 1>I can't say this with absolute certainty,</v>

13
00:00:24.821 --> 00:00:29.821
<v Speaker 1>but I do and so does my crew do everything we possibly can to leave the videos</v>

14
00:00:30.131 --> 00:00:34.540
<v Speaker 1>alone except for getting rid of things that would be of no interest to anyone</v>

15
00:00:34.541 --> 00:00:35.440
<v Speaker 1>that are mistakes.</v>

16
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.900
<v Speaker 1>So there was no disagreement.</v>

17
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.480
<v Speaker 1>Are you interested in coming to Australia?</v>

18
00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:41.081
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

19
00:00:41.081 --> 00:00:43.900
<v Speaker 1>I've been invited a couple of times but it hasn't worked out yet.</v>

20
00:00:43.901 --> 00:00:44.231
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

21
00:00:44.231 --> 00:00:45.064
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

22
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.070
<v Speaker 1>my book will be published in Australia I think sometime in January as well.</v>

23
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.430
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

24
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.430
<v Speaker 1>I imagined that all becoming there at some point in order to talk about my book</v>

25
00:00:57.521 --> 00:00:58.354
<v Speaker 1>and so on.</v>

26
00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.413
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

27
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:01.320
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

28
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.971
<v Speaker 1>Trace is,</v>

29
00:01:01.971 --> 00:01:05.510
<v Speaker 1>how can a person go through the future authoring process of imagining a future</v>

30
00:01:05.511 --> 00:01:08.690
<v Speaker 1>for yourself as though you or someone you care about when you barely don't care</v>

31
00:01:08.691 --> 00:01:10.520
<v Speaker 1>about yourself or even hate yourself?</v>

32
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

33
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:12.590
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

34
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.750
<v Speaker 1>I would say that.</v>

35
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.430
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

36
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.430
<v Speaker 1>go through the exercise anyways and act as like try to extend to yourself some</v>

37
00:01:22.281 --> 00:01:23.114
<v Speaker 1>courtesy.</v>

38
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.601
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

39
00:01:23.601 --> 00:01:27.590
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you have to act something out before you can start to believe it.</v>

40
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.290
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say sit down and</v>

41
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.380
<v Speaker 1>pretend that you're your friend,</v>

42
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:35.131
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:01:35.131 --> 00:01:40.020
<v Speaker 1>trade the probability that there's something so wrong with you that you don't</v>

44
00:01:40.021 --> 00:01:43.320
<v Speaker 1>deserve any regard whatsoever is zero,</v>

45
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.183
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

46
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.010
<v Speaker 1>So and I would say if,</v>

47
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.230
<v Speaker 1>if you just can't get it together,</v>

48
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.060
<v Speaker 1>maybe you are depressed and maybe you need to go talk to someone because you</v>

50
00:01:54.061 --> 00:01:55.200
<v Speaker 1>don't have to be depressed.</v>

51
00:01:55.201 --> 00:01:56.340
<v Speaker 1>You'd talk to a physician,</v>

52
00:01:56.341 --> 00:01:58.440
<v Speaker 1>you know there are treatments for depression.</v>

53
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.980
<v Speaker 1>If you happen to be depressed and if you actually hate yourself,</v>

54
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.710
<v Speaker 1>then it's a possibility that that's what's going on.</v>

55
00:02:04.711 --> 00:02:05.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how old you are,</v>

56
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.570
<v Speaker 1>but you know there are effective treatments for that sort of thing.</v>

57
00:02:09.571 --> 00:02:12.750
<v Speaker 1>You might want to find out if there's actually something wrong physically or,</v>

58
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.520
<v Speaker 1>or psychophysiologic Lee,</v>

59
00:02:14.521 --> 00:02:14.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

60
00:02:14.821 --> 00:02:19.821
<v Speaker 1>because you don't have to trudge through life absolutely miserable there.</v>

61
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.320
<v Speaker 1>Antidepressants for example,</v>

62
00:02:22.321 --> 00:02:23.820
<v Speaker 1>work really well for some people.</v>

63
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:24.720
<v Speaker 1>Not for everyone,</v>

64
00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:25.920
<v Speaker 1>but for some people.</v>
