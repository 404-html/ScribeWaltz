If you're accustomed to keeping things in the fog in general,

2
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.110
you're going to keep yourself in the fog with regards to your investments

3
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.630
because it's some sense everything you do is an investment,

4
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.621
right?

5
00:00:18.621 --> 00:00:18.831
I mean,

6
00:00:18.831 --> 00:00:20.660
some of it's quantified in monetary terms,

7
00:00:20.661 --> 00:00:24.200
but you're always investing in one manner or another.

8
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.820
And so I think if your character is being disrupted by your persistent attempts

9
00:00:28.821 --> 00:00:30.950
to deceive yourself about the nature of reality,

10
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.840
you're going to be a financial train wreck.

11
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:33.621
And I mean,

12
00:00:33.621 --> 00:00:35.840
I've certainly seen that in my clinical practice.

13
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.560
I've seen people burn through amounts of money that you wouldn't think someone

14
00:00:39.561 --> 00:00:43.370
could burn through in that short a period of time because of self deceptive

15
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.390
blindness.
