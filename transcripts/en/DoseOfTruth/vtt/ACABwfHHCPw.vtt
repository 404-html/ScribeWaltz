1
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.600
<v Speaker 1>I have trouble regulating my emotions.</v>

2
00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:13.830
<v Speaker 1>I have a suspicion it's to do with the fact that I'm 90 percentile and openness,</v>

3
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.870
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness and neuroticism and second percentile in agreeableness and</v>

4
00:00:18.871 --> 00:00:19.704
<v Speaker 1>extroversion.</v>

5
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.660
<v Speaker 1>Any tips on dealing with that?</v>

6
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.471
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7
00:00:22.471 --> 00:00:23.304
<v Speaker 1>Well</v>

8
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.230
<v Speaker 1>if you're really high in openness and you're really high in neuroticism,</v>

9
00:00:28.231 --> 00:00:29.790
<v Speaker 1>that can be a rough combination.</v>

10
00:00:29.791 --> 00:00:31.940
<v Speaker 1>The conscientiousness should actually help without,</v>

11
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.110
<v Speaker 1>although it might make you a bit perfectionistic.</v>

12
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

13
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.290
<v Speaker 1>the problem with being high in openness,</v>

14
00:00:37.291 --> 00:00:40.830
<v Speaker 1>which is creativity and interest in ideas and high in neuroticism,</v>

15
00:00:40.831 --> 00:00:45.660
<v Speaker 1>which is tendency towards anxiety and emotional pain is that like open people</v>

16
00:00:45.661 --> 00:00:47.430
<v Speaker 1>like to break open boxes,</v>

17
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.000
<v Speaker 1>conceptual boxes and see what's inside like Pandora's box.</v>

18
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:53.220
<v Speaker 1>But people are high in neuroticism are,</v>

19
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.370
<v Speaker 1>are more likely to respond negatively to complexity and uncertainty.</v>

20
00:00:58.431 --> 00:01:01.630
<v Speaker 1>And if you're an open person and you're always thinking up new things you,</v>

21
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.550
<v Speaker 1>you tend to</v>

22
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.850
<v Speaker 1>saw off the branch that you're sitting on on a regular basis and that can be</v>

23
00:01:08.851 --> 00:01:10.170
<v Speaker 1>pretty destabilizing.</v>

24
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.420
<v Speaker 1>Any tips on dealing with that?</v>

25
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:13.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

26
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.060
<v Speaker 1>I would repeat what I said earlier.</v>

27
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.120
<v Speaker 1>I think that one of the things that you do if you're high in anxiety is to</v>

28
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.830
<v Speaker 1>stabilize your sleep wake cycles.</v>

29
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.840
<v Speaker 1>So get up at the same time,</v>

30
00:01:24.841 --> 00:01:27.030
<v Speaker 1>go to bed at the same time and eat at the same time.</v>

31
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.650
<v Speaker 1>Make sure that you eat breakfast and a big breakfast too that's heavy on fat and</v>

32
00:01:31.651 --> 00:01:36.651
<v Speaker 1>protein because if you're hungry and then you stress yourself,</v>

33
00:01:36.961 --> 00:01:38.580
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're high in neuroticism,</v>

34
00:01:38.581 --> 00:01:40.470
<v Speaker 1>you destabilize your,</v>

35
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.250
<v Speaker 1>your insulin production system and it won't restabilize till you go to sleep</v>

36
00:01:44.251 --> 00:01:44.551
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

37
00:01:44.551 --> 00:01:47.220
<v Speaker 1>So I would say like two things.</v>

38
00:01:47.221 --> 00:01:52.080
<v Speaker 1>One is have a big breakfast and then also if you're feeling particularly</v>

39
00:01:52.081 --> 00:01:52.501
<v Speaker 1>anxious,</v>

40
00:01:52.501 --> 00:01:53.850
<v Speaker 1>try eating something,</v>

41
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.330
<v Speaker 1>not carbohydrates and see if that helps because you,</v>

42
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.420
<v Speaker 1>you might be somewhat permanently dysregulated in your insulin stress related</v>

43
00:02:03.901 --> 00:02:04.860
<v Speaker 1>insulin production.</v>

44
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.150
<v Speaker 1>That would be worth trying.</v>

45
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.280
<v Speaker 1>I would also say that you should shield yourself to some degree from new sources</v>

46
00:02:11.281 --> 00:02:11.630
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

47
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.470
<v Speaker 1>and sources of bad news,</v>

48
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.333
<v Speaker 1>especially,</v>

49
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.010
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

50
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.480
<v Speaker 1>cutout catastrophic news because most of it isn't news.</v>

51
00:02:18.481 --> 00:02:21.360
<v Speaker 1>It's the repetition of things that we already know for well,</v>

52
00:02:21.361 --> 00:02:24.360
<v Speaker 1>and there's reason to protect yourself from,</v>

53
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

54
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.180
<v Speaker 1>an onslaught of negative information,</v>

55
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.340
<v Speaker 1>especially when it's not really necessary for you.</v>

56
00:02:29.341 --> 00:02:29.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

57
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you should bury your head in the sand,</v>

58
00:02:31.741 --> 00:02:35.310
<v Speaker 1>but constant exposure to the catastrophes of the world,</v>

59
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:36.733
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

60
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.670
<v Speaker 1>especially when there's nothing that you can do about those catastrophes even</v>

61
00:02:41.671 --> 00:02:42.510
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically,</v>

62
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.060
<v Speaker 1>is something that can really destabilize people.</v>

63
00:02:45.061 --> 00:02:47.430
<v Speaker 1>I often tell people in my clinical practice,</v>

64
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:48.210
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

65
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.160
<v Speaker 1>which isn't operating right now by the way,</v>

66
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:51.330
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

67
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.350
<v Speaker 1>to shield themselves from news reports because it's just too much.</v>

68
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.910
<v Speaker 1>If you're depressed and anxious,</v>

69
00:02:56.911 --> 00:02:58.560
<v Speaker 1>it's just not something that you need.</v>

70
00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.680
<v Speaker 1>It's not helpful to you.</v>

71
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.460
<v Speaker 1>Second percentile in agreeableness and extroversion.</v>

72
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.893
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

73
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.243
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

74
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.940
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that you can do if you're that low in agreeableness,</v>

75
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.830
<v Speaker 1>that shouldn't dysregulate your emotions,</v>

76
00:03:11.831 --> 00:03:14.470
<v Speaker 1>but it might interfere with your relationships with other people,</v>

77
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.741
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

78
00:03:14.741 --> 00:03:18.310
<v Speaker 1>because you might be a little bit harder to,</v>

79
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.740
<v Speaker 1>you might take other people's feelings into consideration less than might be</v>

80
00:03:23.741 --> 00:03:24.574
<v Speaker 1>good for you.</v>

81
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.600
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that people who are low in agreeableness can do is to try to</v>

82
00:03:28.601 --> 00:03:32.560
<v Speaker 1>think of things they could do for other people and make that a practice you</v>

83
00:03:32.561 --> 00:03:33.010
<v Speaker 1>don't like.</v>

84
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.010
<v Speaker 1>Maybe once a week you could consciously do someone a favor or give someone a</v>

85
00:03:39.161 --> 00:03:39.581
<v Speaker 1>gift,</v>

86
00:03:39.581 --> 00:03:40.510
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

87
00:03:40.511 --> 00:03:41.800
<v Speaker 1>And practice being,</v>

88
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.143
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

89
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:44.463
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>

90
00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.000
<v Speaker 1>Compassionate and polite,</v>

91
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.163
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

92
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.260
<v Speaker 1>that'll expand your personality rather than transforming it.</v>

93
00:03:50.261 --> 00:03:53.050
<v Speaker 1>So then maybe you could have the advantages of being disagreeable,</v>

94
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.410
<v Speaker 1>which means you're tough minded and skeptical and competitive and,</v>

95
00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:57.280
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

96
00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.650
<v Speaker 1>and those can all be really good things,</v>

97
00:03:59.651 --> 00:04:02.410
<v Speaker 1>but it would be nice to be able to leave him out a little bit with some,</v>

98
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.490
<v Speaker 1>with the ability to take other people's perspectives a bit more and to take them</v>

99
00:04:06.491 --> 00:04:07.324
<v Speaker 1>into account.</v>

100
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.781
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

101
00:04:07.781 --> 00:04:08.021
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

102
00:04:08.021 --> 00:04:09.550
<v Speaker 1>if your relationships improve,</v>

103
00:04:09.551 --> 00:04:12.010
<v Speaker 1>that can also improve your emotional stability.</v>

104
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.450
<v Speaker 1>Because one of the ways that people regulate their anxiety is by having people</v>

105
00:04:16.451 --> 00:04:17.920
<v Speaker 1>around them that they get along with.</v>

106
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.580
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>

107
00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

108
00:04:18.911 --> 00:04:19.450
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

109
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:20.530
<v Speaker 1>if you upset people,</v>

110
00:04:20.531 --> 00:04:21.760
<v Speaker 1>then they upset you.</v>

111
00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:23.950
<v Speaker 1>And especially if you're high in neuroticism and,</v>

112
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

113
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.700
<v Speaker 1>that can increase your anxiety and your pain.</v>
