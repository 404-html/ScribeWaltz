1
00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.410
<v Speaker 1>How to be less afraid of death.</v>

2
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.240
<v Speaker 1>I have a better suggestion.</v>

3
00:00:10.241 --> 00:00:13.180
<v Speaker 1>You should be more afraid of not living properly.</v>

4
00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you can be less afraid of death.</v>

5
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.333
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

6
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.230
<v Speaker 1>But I think that here's a hypothesis and this is a Socratic hypothesis.</v>

7
00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:25.480
<v Speaker 1>I write about this in my book too by the way.</v>

8
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.913
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

9
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.220
<v Speaker 1>maybe if you live your life thoroughly,</v>

10
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:31.060
<v Speaker 1>thoroughly,</v>

11
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.331
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

12
00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:33.170
<v Speaker 1>you take use of the advantages,</v>

13
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.470
<v Speaker 1>make use of the advantages that are put in front of you.</v>

14
00:00:35.471 --> 00:00:36.850
<v Speaker 1>Make use of your talents.</v>

15
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.170
<v Speaker 1>Say Yes to things.</v>

16
00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:38.921
<v Speaker 1>Tell the truth,</v>

17
00:00:38.921 --> 00:00:41.380
<v Speaker 1>like stand up and get at it.</v>

18
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm assuming that you can do that,</v>

19
00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.681
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

20
00:00:44.681 --> 00:00:47.400
<v Speaker 1>cause some people are very ill and hurt and,</v>

21
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.820
<v Speaker 1>but assuming you can do that,</v>

22
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.070
<v Speaker 1>I think the only way to combat fear of death is to live fully.</v>

23
00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.380
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that might actually work.</v>

24
00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:57.670
<v Speaker 1>I kind of wonder,</v>

25
00:00:57.671 --> 00:00:59.340
<v Speaker 1>I've talked about this with my father too.</v>

26
00:00:59.341 --> 00:01:00.370
<v Speaker 1>He was getting pretty old.</v>

27
00:01:00.371 --> 00:01:00.671
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

28
00:01:00.671 --> 00:01:01.600
<v Speaker 1>I've asked him if,</v>

29
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.711
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

30
00:01:02.711 --> 00:01:05.860
<v Speaker 1>if he could be transformed back into an 18 year old,</v>

31
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.120
<v Speaker 1>knowing what he knows now,</v>

32
00:01:07.121 --> 00:01:08.050
<v Speaker 1>would he do it?</v>

33
00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:09.970
<v Speaker 1>And he was ambivalent about that.</v>

34
00:01:09.971 --> 00:01:10.151
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

35
00:01:10.151 --> 00:01:10.901
<v Speaker 1>he didn't say no,</v>

36
00:01:10.901 --> 00:01:12.190
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't say yes.</v>

37
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.020
<v Speaker 1>And we talked about this idea that if you lived your life fully,</v>

38
00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:18.723
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

39
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.160
<v Speaker 1>maybe that would be good enough because,</v>

40
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.461
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:01:21.461 --> 00:01:22.630
<v Speaker 1>I loved having kids,</v>

42
00:01:22.631 --> 00:01:27.631
<v Speaker 1>but I don't feel that I would have kids again.</v>

43
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:28.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

44
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.630
<v Speaker 1>because in some sense I've already done that.</v>

45
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.260
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe there's a set number of adventures that you have to go on in your</v>

46
00:01:37.961 --> 00:01:38.411
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

47
00:01:38.411 --> 00:01:39.970
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you have to be buried,</v>

48
00:01:39.971 --> 00:01:40.751
<v Speaker 1>you have to have kids,</v>

49
00:01:40.751 --> 00:01:41.650
<v Speaker 1>you have to have a career,</v>

50
00:01:41.651 --> 00:01:42.790
<v Speaker 1>you have to have friends,</v>

51
00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.320
<v Speaker 1>you have to have something useful to do with your time outside of work.</v>

52
00:01:47.321 --> 00:01:50.050
<v Speaker 1>All those are all things that are covered in the future authoring program.</v>

53
00:01:50.051 --> 00:01:50.884
<v Speaker 1>By the way.</v>

54
00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.480
<v Speaker 1>Maybe if you do all those,</v>

55
00:01:52.481 --> 00:01:53.140
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

56
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.921
<v Speaker 1>that's good enough.</v>

57
00:01:53.921 --> 00:01:54.990
<v Speaker 1>You've had your life and,</v>

58
00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.380
<v Speaker 1>and that's enough.</v>

59
00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.681
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

60
00:01:56.681 --> 00:01:57.514
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

61
00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.710
<v Speaker 1>10 years ago I thought,</v>

62
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:00.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

63
00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.050
<v Speaker 1>if I could extend my life radically,</v>

64
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.143
<v Speaker 1>then I would,</v>

65
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.080
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not so sure about that now that I'm,</v>

66
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm 55 you know,</v>

67
00:02:10.521 --> 00:02:11.354
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting older.</v>

68
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.990
<v Speaker 1>I kind of have a suspicion that you might come to an end,</v>

69
00:02:17.991 --> 00:02:18.824
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

70
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.420
<v Speaker 1>That's what it looks like.</v>

71
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:21.201
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

72
00:02:21.201 --> 00:02:22.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't want that to be soon,</v>

73
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.863
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

74
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.780
<v Speaker 1>maybe you exhaust yourself in your life,</v>

75
00:02:27.781 --> 00:02:27.991
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

76
00:02:27.991 --> 00:02:30.570
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you can so that there's nothing left of you really.</v>
