1
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.010
<v Speaker 1>So if you're going to hurt someone,</v>

2
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:11.660
<v Speaker 1>what do you think essentially is,</v>

3
00:00:11.661 --> 00:00:11.871
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

4
00:00:11.871 --> 00:00:13.490
<v Speaker 1>what would really hurt me?</v>

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.271
<v Speaker 1>And then you think,</v>

6
00:00:14.271 --> 00:00:14.391
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

7
00:00:14.391 --> 00:00:15.500
<v Speaker 1>I'll just do that to them.</v>

8
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.251
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's,</v>

9
00:00:16.251 --> 00:00:16.551
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

10
00:00:16.551 --> 00:00:17.384
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

11
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.500
<v Speaker 1>that's a good theory.</v>

12
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.510
<v Speaker 1>It's very sophisticated.</v>

13
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.771
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

14
00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:22.070
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

15
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.371
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

16
00:00:22.371 --> 00:00:23.091
<v Speaker 1>so what happens,</v>

17
00:00:23.091 --> 00:00:24.170
<v Speaker 1>Adam and eve wake up,</v>

18
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.430
<v Speaker 1>they weren't supposed to do this.</v>

19
00:00:25.431 --> 00:00:27.980
<v Speaker 1>God told them that they are going to be sorry if they did that,</v>

20
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.470
<v Speaker 1>but they did it anyways because that's what people are like.</v>

21
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.940
<v Speaker 1>And because we always learn things that knock us out of our present paradises</v>

22
00:00:36.921 --> 00:00:37.281
<v Speaker 1>right too.</v>

23
00:00:37.281 --> 00:00:41.810
<v Speaker 1>We're curious and we won't leave things alone and maybe things are not so bad.</v>

24
00:00:41.811 --> 00:00:42.644
<v Speaker 1>And then you,</v>

25
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.951
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:00:42.951 --> 00:00:46.670
<v Speaker 1>ask some questions that maybe you're not so happy about asking.</v>

27
00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:50.450
<v Speaker 1>Once you find the answer and you fall out of your little paradise into history</v>

28
00:00:50.451 --> 00:00:52.890
<v Speaker 1>and you've got to work to set things right again.</v>

29
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.253
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

30
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.060
<v Speaker 1>God gets wind of this and,</v>

31
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.710
<v Speaker 1>and he chases Adam and eve out of the garden of Eden.</v>

32
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.740
<v Speaker 1>But he says some interesting things when he chases them out.</v>

33
00:01:05.741 --> 00:01:06.041
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

34
00:01:06.041 --> 00:01:06.874
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

35
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.063
<v Speaker 1>now you know,</v>

36
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.070
<v Speaker 1>what's the consequence of that?</v>

37
00:01:12.071 --> 00:01:12.521
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>

38
00:01:12.521 --> 00:01:12.771
<v Speaker 1>Dad,</v>

39
00:01:12.771 --> 00:01:12.880
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

40
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.170
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to work.</v>

41
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.161
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

42
00:01:15.161 --> 00:01:15.911
<v Speaker 1>that's cool.</v>

43
00:01:15.911 --> 00:01:16.760
<v Speaker 1>That's really cool.</v>

44
00:01:16.761 --> 00:01:19.260
<v Speaker 1>What he has gone after all it also,</v>

45
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.590
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

46
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.010
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

47
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.520
<v Speaker 1>he knows what he's talking about.</v>

48
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.163
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

49
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.190
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to work.</v>

50
00:01:24.191 --> 00:01:27.460
<v Speaker 1>So why would you have to work now that you knew you were vulnerable?</v>

51
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.241
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

52
00:01:28.241 --> 00:01:29.110
<v Speaker 1>the answer to that is,</v>

53
00:01:29.111 --> 00:01:29.381
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

54
00:01:29.381 --> 00:01:30.310
<v Speaker 1>if you know you're vulnerable,</v>

55
00:01:30.311 --> 00:01:31.990
<v Speaker 1>that stretches out into the future,</v>

56
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.220
<v Speaker 1>you know you're going to die.</v>

57
00:01:33.221 --> 00:01:34.630
<v Speaker 1>You know that you're fragile.</v>

58
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.660
<v Speaker 1>It's like maybe all your problems are solved right now.</v>

59
00:01:37.661 --> 00:01:38.500
<v Speaker 1>You're all sitting here,</v>

60
00:01:38.501 --> 00:01:39.041
<v Speaker 1>you're safe,</v>

61
00:01:39.041 --> 00:01:39.874
<v Speaker 1>you're not hungry.</v>

62
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.290
<v Speaker 1>You don't want anything to drink,</v>

63
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.250
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

64
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.930
<v Speaker 1>But what about tomorrow?</v>

65
00:01:43.931 --> 00:01:46.750
<v Speaker 1>What about next week or next month or 10 years from now?</v>

66
00:01:46.751 --> 00:01:47.051
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

67
00:01:47.051 --> 00:01:49.840
<v Speaker 1>just because you got all your problems solved for this second doesn't mean</v>

68
00:01:49.841 --> 00:01:54.190
<v Speaker 1>you've got him solved for the rest of your iterations through time.</v>

69
00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:55.960
<v Speaker 1>So you've got to work.</v>

70
00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.690
<v Speaker 1>And the work is the sacrifice of the present for the future.</v>

71
00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:00.760
<v Speaker 1>And so that's exactly right.</v>

72
00:02:00.761 --> 00:02:02.410
<v Speaker 1>You have to work now.</v>

73
00:02:02.411 --> 00:02:02.731
<v Speaker 1>You see?</v>

74
00:02:02.731 --> 00:02:04.330
<v Speaker 1>See what's interesting about that,</v>

75
00:02:04.331 --> 00:02:05.440
<v Speaker 1>and this is the theory that I was,</v>

76
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.621
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

77
00:02:05.621 --> 00:02:08.080
<v Speaker 1>and then of course God tells that Eve,</v>

78
00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.471
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

79
00:02:08.471 --> 00:02:09.304
<v Speaker 1>you've really,</v>

80
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

81
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.410
<v Speaker 1>screwed things up too.</v>

82
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.770
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have these big brain babies and,</v>

83
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.580
<v Speaker 1>and that's our big problem.</v>

84
00:02:15.581 --> 00:02:19.840
<v Speaker 1>You're going to suffer in childbirth and then they're going to be dependent on</v>

85
00:02:19.841 --> 00:02:20.471
<v Speaker 1>you forever.</v>

86
00:02:20.471 --> 00:02:23.560
<v Speaker 1>And because of that you're going to be dependent on this man that you just woke</v>

87
00:02:23.561 --> 00:02:23.741
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

88
00:02:23.741 --> 00:02:25.840
<v Speaker 1>And that's not going to be very pleasant for either of you,</v>

89
00:02:25.841 --> 00:02:27.100
<v Speaker 1>but tough luck.</v>

90
00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.050
<v Speaker 1>And so that's it.</v>

91
00:02:29.051 --> 00:02:30.750
<v Speaker 1>That's the curse in some sense.</v>

92
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.320
<v Speaker 1>And it's exactly right.</v>

93
00:02:32.321 --> 00:02:33.011
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is,</v>

94
00:02:33.011 --> 00:02:34.270
<v Speaker 1>there's a theory in there.</v>

95
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.320
<v Speaker 1>There's an interesting theory of suffering that's implicit in that story.</v>

96
00:02:38.321 --> 00:02:41.830
<v Speaker 1>And the theory of suffering is that suffering is built into the structure of</v>

97
00:02:41.831 --> 00:02:43.240
<v Speaker 1>self conscious big.</v>

98
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.310
<v Speaker 1>It's built right into the structure.</v>

99
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.620
<v Speaker 1>So if you're a self conscious being,</v>

100
00:02:47.621 --> 00:02:48.660
<v Speaker 1>that's your lot,</v>

101
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.650
<v Speaker 1>it isn't someone else's fault.</v>

102
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.550
<v Speaker 1>It isn't a consequence of sociological oppression.</v>

103
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.961
<v Speaker 1>It isn't the,</v>

104
00:02:55.961 --> 00:02:58.810
<v Speaker 1>it a consequences of the fact that our society isn't organized.</v>

105
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.680
<v Speaker 1>It's just part of being.</v>

106
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.431
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

107
00:03:04.431 --> 00:03:06.230
<v Speaker 1>So that's a big deal because that's a,</v>

108
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.630
<v Speaker 1>that's an important theory because one of the questions is,</v>

109
00:03:08.631 --> 00:03:09.111
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

110
00:03:09.111 --> 00:03:09.561
<v Speaker 1>we'll hit a,</v>

111
00:03:09.561 --> 00:03:11.660
<v Speaker 1>why is there suffering and what are you going to do about it?</v>

112
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.830
<v Speaker 1>And it's a big,</v>

113
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.860
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot different if it's just the way it is for you and if it's actually</v>

114
00:03:17.871 --> 00:03:19.280
<v Speaker 1>your fault that he's suffering,</v>

115
00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.880
<v Speaker 1>those are,</v>

116
00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.060
<v Speaker 1>or maybe it's the group's fault that you're suffering.</v>

117
00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.710
<v Speaker 1>Those are major,</v>

118
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.480
<v Speaker 1>those theories are really,</v>

119
00:03:26.481 --> 00:03:27.111
<v Speaker 1>really different.</v>

120
00:03:27.111 --> 00:03:29.630
<v Speaker 1>And then in the second story in Kate enable,</v>

121
00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:31.813
<v Speaker 2>MMM</v>

122
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.950
<v Speaker 1>cane make sacrifices to try to get it in good with God enabled make sacrifices</v>

123
00:03:37.471 --> 00:03:41.400
<v Speaker 1>and the sacrifices are kind of archaic from our perspective.</v>

124
00:03:41.401 --> 00:03:42.310
<v Speaker 1>They're burnt offering.</v>

125
00:03:42.311 --> 00:03:46.590
<v Speaker 1>So the smoke goes up where God can detect it because he's up there somewhere up</v>

126
00:03:46.591 --> 00:03:51.591
<v Speaker 1>there where the stars are and God rejects cane sacrifices and we don't really</v>

127
00:03:52.021 --> 00:03:52.441
<v Speaker 1>know why,</v>

128
00:03:52.441 --> 00:03:54.870
<v Speaker 1>but it kind of looks like Cain is a second grader.</v>

129
00:03:54.871 --> 00:03:58.080
<v Speaker 1>And then God Cain goes and complains to God and says like,</v>

130
00:03:58.081 --> 00:04:02.970
<v Speaker 1>what kind of stupid universe did you make here I'm breaking myself and half</v>

131
00:04:02.971 --> 00:04:04.200
<v Speaker 1>trying to get things together,</v>

132
00:04:04.201 --> 00:04:06.090
<v Speaker 1>making the proper sacrifices.</v>

133
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.120
<v Speaker 1>And nothing's going well for me and Abel.</v>

134
00:04:09.121 --> 00:04:09.451
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

135
00:04:09.451 --> 00:04:09.751
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

136
00:04:09.751 --> 00:04:10.584
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

137
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.050
<v Speaker 1>everything he touches turns to gold.</v>

138
00:04:13.051 --> 00:04:13.950
<v Speaker 1>Everyone loves him.</v>

139
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.450
<v Speaker 1>He's even a really good guy.</v>

140
00:04:15.451 --> 00:04:16.890
<v Speaker 1>It's like so annoying.</v>

141
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.410
<v Speaker 1>What's up with this place you've built?</v>

142
00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:21.000
<v Speaker 1>And God tells Kane,</v>

143
00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:25.410
<v Speaker 1>don't become an and telling me that the entire fabric of reality is wrong</v>

144
00:04:25.411 --> 00:04:27.300
<v Speaker 1>because it isn't working out for you.</v>

145
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.850
<v Speaker 1>Says Sin Crouches at your door,</v>

146
00:04:29.851 --> 00:04:30.684
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

147
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.080
<v Speaker 1>like a sexually aroused predatory cat.</v>

148
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.820
<v Speaker 1>That's basically the metaphor that,</v>

149
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.140
<v Speaker 1>that God uses.</v>

150
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.130
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>

151
00:04:38.131 --> 00:04:41.400
<v Speaker 1>and you let it in and had it and let it have its way with you.</v>

152
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.990
<v Speaker 1>And that's really an interesting way of putting it because what God says to Cain</v>

153
00:04:45.991 --> 00:04:46.824
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>

154
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

155
00:04:47.401 --> 00:04:50.010
<v Speaker 1>you're all bitter and resentful and really it's no wonder,</v>

156
00:04:50.011 --> 00:04:50.641
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

157
00:04:50.641 --> 00:04:52.260
<v Speaker 1>things aren't going well for you.</v>

158
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.710
<v Speaker 1>And then you've got able who's over shining you in every way.</v>

159
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:56.730
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

160
00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:58.351
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

161
00:04:58.351 --> 00:04:59.490
<v Speaker 1>it's your fault.</v>

162
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.770
<v Speaker 1>This terrible thing waited at the door,</v>

163
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.120
<v Speaker 1>you let it in and then you entered into a creative union with it and you</v>

164
00:05:09.121 --> 00:05:11.190
<v Speaker 1>produced something as a consequence.</v>

165
00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.520
<v Speaker 1>And that's this tormented spirit that you have now.</v>

166
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.250
<v Speaker 1>And it's polluting your relationship with reality.</v>

167
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.030
<v Speaker 1>And that's why things aren't working so out very well for you.</v>

168
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:26.270
<v Speaker 1>So go put yourself together before you come and tell me just exactly what's</v>

169
00:05:27.061 --> 00:05:28.920
<v Speaker 1>wrong with the structure of reality.</v>

170
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.640
<v Speaker 1>And Cain isn't very happy about that because really is that really what you want</v>

171
00:05:32.641 --> 00:05:33.330
<v Speaker 1>to hear?</v>

172
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.691
<v Speaker 1>It's right.</v>

173
00:05:33.691 --> 00:05:38.691
<v Speaker 1>Like you have more misery than is necessary because you really didn't put your</v>

174
00:05:39.511 --> 00:05:43.860
<v Speaker 1>act together and you know it and you've done it creatively.</v>

175
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.560
<v Speaker 1>And so Kayden goes and kills Abel.</v>

176
00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.570
<v Speaker 1>That's the story of how resentment enters the world.</v>

177
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.170
<v Speaker 1>And it's the first story in the Judeo Christian Canon,</v>

178
00:05:54.171 --> 00:05:58.430
<v Speaker 1>let's say about actual human beings because and eve were made by God,</v>

179
00:05:58.431 --> 00:05:59.450
<v Speaker 1>so they don't really count.</v>

180
00:05:59.451 --> 00:06:00.830
<v Speaker 1>Cain and Abel were born.</v>

181
00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:02.720
<v Speaker 1>And so that's something.</v>

182
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.520
<v Speaker 1>So there's a reaction to suffering,</v>

183
00:06:04.521 --> 00:06:04.761
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

184
00:06:04.761 --> 00:06:08.720
<v Speaker 1>The necessity of sacrifice and the consequence of the necessity of sacrifices</v>

185
00:06:08.721 --> 00:06:11.300
<v Speaker 1>that some sacrifices work and others don't.</v>

186
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.510
<v Speaker 1>And then if your sacrifices aren't met with the,</v>

187
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.070
<v Speaker 1>with the goodwill of God,</v>

188
00:06:16.071 --> 00:06:16.904
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

189
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.350
<v Speaker 1>well then that makes you angry.</v>

190
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.981
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

191
00:06:18.981 --> 00:06:19.850
<v Speaker 1>of course it does.</v>

192
00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.980
<v Speaker 1>You can take God out of the story if you want,</v>

193
00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:26.180
<v Speaker 1>if you're not happy with that kind of mythological or narrative statement.</v>

194
00:06:26.181 --> 00:06:29.390
<v Speaker 1>But it doesn't really matter because the whole point is is that if you make</v>

195
00:06:29.391 --> 00:06:30.171
<v Speaker 1>sacrifices,</v>

196
00:06:30.171 --> 00:06:31.820
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're second rate,</v>

197
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.520
<v Speaker 1>things aren't going to go very well for you and you're going to get bitter and</v>

198
00:06:34.521 --> 00:06:37.520
<v Speaker 1>resentful and murderous and maybe genocidal.</v>

199
00:06:37.521 --> 00:06:38.810
<v Speaker 1>And it's really interesting,</v>

200
00:06:38.811 --> 00:06:39.081
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

201
00:06:39.081 --> 00:06:43.280
<v Speaker 1>because Kane has descendants and if you bug,</v>

202
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.200
<v Speaker 1>if you transgress against them,</v>

203
00:06:45.201 --> 00:06:46.160
<v Speaker 1>they don't just kill you,</v>

204
00:06:46.161 --> 00:06:49.700
<v Speaker 1>they kill seven of you and then his later descendants kill 49 of you.</v>

205
00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:54.680
<v Speaker 1>There's this exponential growth of murderousness as a consequence of canes,</v>

206
00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:59.280
<v Speaker 1>primary primal fratricide.</v>

207
00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:01.530
<v Speaker 1>And then the next story is the flood.</v>

208
00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:06.180
<v Speaker 1>And that's not an accident is nothing in those stories is an accident.</v>

209
00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:07.231
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

210
00:07:07.231 --> 00:07:10.230
<v Speaker 1>so now you got two different theories about the nature of suffering.</v>

211
00:07:10.231 --> 00:07:12.630
<v Speaker 1>You've got the one I just laid out,</v>

212
00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:17.250
<v Speaker 1>it's called the foundational story of suffering and malevolence.</v>

213
00:07:17.251 --> 00:07:18.090
<v Speaker 1>And you have the marks,</v>

214
00:07:18.091 --> 00:07:18.541
<v Speaker 1>a story,</v>

215
00:07:18.541 --> 00:07:22.020
<v Speaker 1>which is while there's oppressed people and the reason they're all pressed in</v>

216
00:07:22.021 --> 00:07:24.510
<v Speaker 1>suffering is because the oppressors are oppressing them.</v>

217
00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:26.520
<v Speaker 1>Those are not the same theories.</v>

218
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:27.660
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

219
00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:31.260
<v Speaker 1>And there's a utopianism that's implicit in Marxism,</v>

220
00:07:31.261 --> 00:07:34.650
<v Speaker 1>which is if you could just get the damn oh pressers to stop oppressing the</v>

221
00:07:34.651 --> 00:07:35.484
<v Speaker 1>oppressed,</v>

222
00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.890
<v Speaker 1>then the utopia would arrive.</v>

223
00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:42.960
<v Speaker 1>And so not only are the oppressors responsible for the suffering of the poor,</v>

224
00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:48.000
<v Speaker 1>they're also responsible for the fact that the utopia isn't here for everyone.</v>

225
00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:50.820
<v Speaker 1>And so how reprehensible can you get?</v>

226
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:53.751
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

227
00:07:53.751 --> 00:07:58.751
<v Speaker 1>then that certainly justifies that degree of malevolence justifies pretty much</v>

228
00:07:58.821 --> 00:08:00.230
<v Speaker 1>anything you'd like to do to them.</v>
