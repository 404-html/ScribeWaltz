1
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.390
<v Speaker 1>Not so good to have a low Iq.</v>

2
00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:05.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.440
<v Speaker 1>people don't like the idea of Iq because it seems so arbitrary,</v>

4
00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:11.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:12.490
<v Speaker 1>have a high Iq.</v>

6
00:00:12.491 --> 00:00:14.350
<v Speaker 1>Well it's not like you deserve that.</v>

7
00:00:14.351 --> 00:00:14.951
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

8
00:00:14.951 --> 00:00:18.640
<v Speaker 1>It's your set up that way pretty much right from the beginning.</v>

9
00:00:18.641 --> 00:00:19.474
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

10
00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:20.051
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

11
00:00:20.051 --> 00:00:20.501
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

12
00:00:20.501 --> 00:00:21.640
<v Speaker 1>very stable.</v>

13
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.250
<v Speaker 1>You can make a high Iq person stupider.</v>

14
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:25.231
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

15
00:00:25.231 --> 00:00:25.510
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

16
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.320
<v Speaker 1>not educating them up to the level of their possibility but taking someone who</v>

17
00:00:29.321 --> 00:00:31.330
<v Speaker 1>has a low Iq and trying to raise that.</v>

18
00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:33.190
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you can figure out how to do that,</v>

19
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.670
<v Speaker 1>well you know it's Nobel prize time for you because people have tried that a lot</v>

20
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.510
<v Speaker 1>and most recently with those,</v>

21
00:00:40.511 --> 00:00:44.230
<v Speaker 1>you know Luminol Lumosity games and that sort of thing and the evidence that</v>

22
00:00:44.231 --> 00:00:49.231
<v Speaker 1>those produce anything other than brilliant performances on the Lumosity game</v>

23
00:00:50.951 --> 00:00:53.260
<v Speaker 1>itself is basically zero.</v>

24
00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.300
<v Speaker 1>We haven't been able to figure out how to see cause I intelligence is a cross</v>

25
00:00:58.301 --> 00:01:03.010
<v Speaker 1>domain phenomena and you can get really good in a single domain by practicing</v>

26
00:01:03.011 --> 00:01:07.420
<v Speaker 1>like Matt and what you'd want is to practice like mad in a single domain and</v>

27
00:01:07.421 --> 00:01:09.760
<v Speaker 1>hope that it generalizes to other domains.</v>

28
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.700
<v Speaker 1>That's the holy grail of intelligence increase.</v>

29
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.720
<v Speaker 1>It's like no,</v>

30
00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:15.610
<v Speaker 1>no one's done it.</v>

31
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.660
<v Speaker 1>People claim it but the claims never hold up and people have been trying for a</v>

32
00:01:19.661 --> 00:01:22.930
<v Speaker 1>long time to do it and they haven't been able to do it.</v>

33
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.033
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

34
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.770
<v Speaker 1>differences in Iq really make a difference.</v>

35
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.190
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

36
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean you guys,</v>

37
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.440
<v Speaker 1>average Iq is probably one 25 one 30 ad at one 15 you're at the 85th percentile</v>

38
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.610
<v Speaker 1>and and one 15 would barely get you going for,</v>

39
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.980
<v Speaker 1>for hard university one 30 you're probably graduate school material,</v>

40
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.400
<v Speaker 1>you know one 45 you're up there</v>

41
00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.480
<v Speaker 1>at the range where you can probably do pretty much whatever you want.</v>

42
00:01:59.481 --> 00:02:01.130
<v Speaker 1>Although as you get smarter,</v>

43
00:02:01.131 --> 00:02:03.610
<v Speaker 1>the scatter between your abilities increase.</v>

44
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.340
<v Speaker 1>So you might have a very high verbal Iq but not be so good at mathematics or the</v>

45
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:08.323
<v Speaker 1>other way around.</v>

46
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.720
<v Speaker 1>But it's a massive contributor to lifetime success.</v>

47
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.590
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know what to do about that.</v>

48
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.453
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

49
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.920
<v Speaker 1>why do smart people make more money?</v>

50
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

51
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.090
<v Speaker 1>they get to where the edge of production is faster.</v>

52
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.090
<v Speaker 1>So if you have a thousand people and you rank order them by Iq,</v>

53
00:02:29.091 --> 00:02:32.480
<v Speaker 1>the smart people are going to come up with a new ideas first and they're going</v>

54
00:02:32.481 --> 00:02:35.600
<v Speaker 1>to have more ideas and they're going to strategize better.</v>

55
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.870
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

56
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.340
<v Speaker 1>with an Iq of 90 which is</v>

57
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.280
<v Speaker 1>15% of the population,</v>

58
00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.890
<v Speaker 1>you think about that 15% of the population.</v>

59
00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.690
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty much the threshold for reading instructions and being able to</v>

60
00:02:52.691 --> 00:02:53.524
<v Speaker 1>follow them.</v>

61
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.280
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

62
00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.113
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

63
00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.000
<v Speaker 1>and our societies and Chris increasingly sophisticated.</v>

64
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.170
<v Speaker 1>So it's by no means obvious.</v>

65
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.760
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

66
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.511
<v Speaker 1>the Liberals think,</v>

67
00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:09.511
<v Speaker 1>well the society is unfair because there's unemployment and the Conservatives</v>

68
00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:12.310
<v Speaker 1>think while there's a job for everyone and,</v>

69
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:13.930
<v Speaker 1>but none of them think,</v>

70
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.231
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

71
00:03:14.231 --> 00:03:15.160
<v Speaker 1>there are massive,</v>

72
00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:15.821
<v Speaker 1>massive,</v>

73
00:03:15.821 --> 00:03:18.100
<v Speaker 1>massive differences in people's ability,</v>

74
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.530
<v Speaker 1>far greater than anyone realizes.</v>

75
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.620
<v Speaker 1>And that poses a structural problem.</v>
