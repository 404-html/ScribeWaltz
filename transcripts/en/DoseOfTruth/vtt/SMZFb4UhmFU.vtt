1
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm fascinated by the idea of faith,</v>

2
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.520
<v Speaker 1>what faith means.</v>

3
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:12.060
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.120
<v Speaker 1>Jacob listens to a voice and believes it.</v>

5
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.433
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

6
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.020
<v Speaker 1>he probably heard other voices.</v>

7
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.840
<v Speaker 1>Why did he believe this one?</v>

8
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

9
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:23.573
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

10
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:24.240
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

11
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.240
<v Speaker 1>there must have been an a priori sort of functional necessity for him to believe</v>

12
00:00:31.411 --> 00:00:34.350
<v Speaker 1>the voice that told him one thing or another.</v>

13
00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.780
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

14
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.980
<v Speaker 1>and I think that that's a string that runs through the Bible and then through</v>

15
00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:38.850
<v Speaker 1>the New Testament,</v>

16
00:00:38.851 --> 00:00:39.301
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

17
00:00:39.301 --> 00:00:40.860
<v Speaker 1>we are expected as well.</v>

18
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.510
<v Speaker 1>I confess I'm a Christian,</v>

19
00:00:42.511 --> 00:00:42.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

20
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.880
<v Speaker 1>I act like I believe God is real.</v>

21
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:45.750
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

22
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.250
<v Speaker 1>and so there is this a call of faith and also the,</v>

23
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.800
<v Speaker 1>in every hero's story we,</v>

24
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.830
<v Speaker 1>we see now there is always a moment in that story where the hero must believe</v>

25
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.830
<v Speaker 1>something beyond the evidence that is before them,</v>

26
00:01:01.831 --> 00:01:03.570
<v Speaker 1>which is to say they must take a leap of faith.</v>

27
00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.560
<v Speaker 1>So I'm wondering if you could just kind of unpack that experience of faith and</v>

28
00:01:07.561 --> 00:01:12.030
<v Speaker 1>the understanding of how a human being makes the choice to believe one thing or</v>

29
00:01:12.031 --> 00:01:12.750
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

30
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:13.111
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

31
00:01:13.111 --> 00:01:14.250
<v Speaker 1>that's a great question.</v>

32
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

33
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.833
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

34
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.830
<v Speaker 1>is this still on,</v>

35
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.040
<v Speaker 1>is this still working?</v>

36
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.940
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

37
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:21.420
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

38
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.721
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

39
00:01:21.721 --> 00:01:22.410
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

40
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:23.243
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

41
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.233
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

42
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't precisely know the answer that it's a very peculiar thing because we</v>

43
00:01:28.981 --> 00:01:30.090
<v Speaker 1>think many things,</v>

44
00:01:30.091 --> 00:01:35.091
<v Speaker 1>or you could say many voices appear in our minds because when Nisha took day</v>

45
00:01:35.821 --> 00:01:36.181
<v Speaker 1>cards,</v>

46
00:01:36.181 --> 00:01:38.160
<v Speaker 1>I think therefore I am a part can you said,</v>

47
00:01:38.161 --> 00:01:38.311
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

48
00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:40.110
<v Speaker 1>it isn't so obvious that there's an eye,</v>

49
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.840
<v Speaker 1>first of all that it's a unity,</v>

50
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.020
<v Speaker 1>like a not our tra unity transparent unto itself,</v>

51
00:01:46.021 --> 00:01:49.800
<v Speaker 1>which of course the psychoanalysts picked up in a big way and then he wasn't</v>

52
00:01:49.801 --> 00:01:53.520
<v Speaker 1>sure that it was the eye who thought in some causal manner.</v>

53
00:01:53.521 --> 00:01:53.851
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

54
00:01:53.851 --> 00:01:54.241
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>

55
00:01:54.241 --> 00:01:55.830
<v Speaker 1>it's more like thoughts.</v>

56
00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.180
<v Speaker 1>It's something like thoughts appear in the phenomenal field and maybe you choose</v>

57
00:02:00.181 --> 00:02:01.950
<v Speaker 1>between the more maybe they possess you.</v>

58
00:02:01.951 --> 00:02:03.720
<v Speaker 1>Like there's lots of other ways of thinking about it.</v>

59
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.110
<v Speaker 1>It isn't exactly obvious to me why we choose to take one pathway rather than</v>

60
00:02:09.391 --> 00:02:14.391
<v Speaker 1>another when so many of them could offer themselves to us.</v>

61
00:02:14.671 --> 00:02:15.180
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

62
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.630
<v Speaker 1>people tend to talk about that as something like conscience,</v>

63
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

64
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.990
<v Speaker 1>And now maybe it's that</v>

65
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.920
<v Speaker 1>it's got to have something to do.</v>

66
00:02:29.921 --> 00:02:34.921
<v Speaker 1>I think it's an endless regress because you can always ask why the,</v>

67
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.960
<v Speaker 1>why any assumption became primary.</v>

68
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.270
<v Speaker 1>But I'll put that aside for a moment.</v>

69
00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.050
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me to have something to do with your aims.</v>

70
00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

71
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.820
<v Speaker 1>that you're more likely to listen to a voice that is in keeping with your most</v>

72
00:02:51.701 --> 00:02:52.960
<v Speaker 1>fundamental aims.</v>

73
00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:54.670
<v Speaker 1>And then the question is,</v>

74
00:02:54.671 --> 00:02:56.830
<v Speaker 1>where do your most fundamental aims come from?</v>

75
00:02:56.831 --> 00:02:58.930
<v Speaker 1>And from what I've been able to determine it,</v>

76
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.760
<v Speaker 1>I'll speak psychologically again,</v>

77
00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:02.800
<v Speaker 1>is that to begin with,</v>

78
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:07.690
<v Speaker 1>you're a con can't tonation of rather primitive subpersonalities Hungary,</v>

79
00:03:07.691 --> 00:03:10.780
<v Speaker 1>one's tired ones upset one's laughing ones.</v>

80
00:03:10.781 --> 00:03:11.950
<v Speaker 1>You can see that in babies,</v>

81
00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:12.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

82
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.110
<v Speaker 1>they cycle through those states very rapidly.</v>

83
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.183
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

84
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:16.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

85
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.640
<v Speaker 1>infantile unity above all that,</v>

86
00:03:18.641 --> 00:03:19.960
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't have control,</v>

87
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.853
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

88
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.720
<v Speaker 1>And so then the developing individual has to figure out how to integrate those</v>

89
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.490
<v Speaker 1>primitive subpersonalities into a unified personality.</v>

90
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.440
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

91
00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:36.640
<v Speaker 1>they integrate the unified personality into a social unity.</v>

92
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.260
<v Speaker 1>So it's partly individual integration,</v>

93
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.600
<v Speaker 1>but it's fed by social forces.</v>

94
00:03:43.601 --> 00:03:46.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean even when you watch an infant breastfeed,</v>

95
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.790
<v Speaker 1>it's established a relationship with its mother and there's a reciprocity that's</v>

96
00:03:51.791 --> 00:03:53.200
<v Speaker 1>already at play there.</v>

97
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.800
<v Speaker 1>So then that underlying multiplicities starts to form itself into a unity.</v>

98
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.580
<v Speaker 1>And then the question,</v>

99
00:04:00.581 --> 00:04:04.810
<v Speaker 1>and I would say that's something like that's something like the emergence of</v>

100
00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:05.540
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

101
00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:06.820
<v Speaker 1>the individual out of,</v>

102
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.310
<v Speaker 1>out of the the titans.</v>

103
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.320
<v Speaker 1>That's a reasonable way of thinking about it.</v>

104
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.720
<v Speaker 1>Like a sovereign out of the titans.</v>

105
00:04:13.721 --> 00:04:14.710
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

106
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.610
<v Speaker 1>But then there's another division which seems to me to parallel parallel the the</v>

107
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:22.030
<v Speaker 1>cane enabled division.</v>

108
00:04:22.031 --> 00:04:25.780
<v Speaker 1>It's that that integration can be oriented towards something that's positive,</v>

109
00:04:25.781 --> 00:04:30.460
<v Speaker 1>but it can also be oriented towards something that's negative and that's the</v>

110
00:04:30.461 --> 00:04:33.010
<v Speaker 1>split of the world into good and evil I think.</v>

111
00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.240
<v Speaker 1>And then it looks like you're navigating between those and I can only account</v>

112
00:04:37.241 --> 00:04:39.010
<v Speaker 1>for that with something like choice,</v>

113
00:04:39.011 --> 00:04:40.330
<v Speaker 1>like I think the free choice,</v>

114
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.850
<v Speaker 1>even though I don't understand it,</v>

115
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm unwilling to deny the existence of free choice merely because I don't</v>

116
00:04:48.011 --> 00:04:52.870
<v Speaker 1>understand it because it looks to me like that's how people act.</v>

117
00:04:52.871 --> 00:04:54.370
<v Speaker 1>That's how the expect to be treated.</v>

118
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.050
<v Speaker 1>And that societies who,</v>

119
00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.160
<v Speaker 1>that that structure themselves in accordance with the idea that people have free</v>

120
00:05:00.161 --> 00:05:01.960
<v Speaker 1>choice actually work.</v>

121
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.330
<v Speaker 1>Now that doesn't prove that there's free choice,</v>

122
00:05:04.331 --> 00:05:06.190
<v Speaker 1>but people have been arguing about that forever.</v>

123
00:05:06.191 --> 00:05:07.024
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

124
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:08.231
<v Speaker 1>but it looks to me,</v>

125
00:05:08.231 --> 00:05:10.930
<v Speaker 1>so those are two possible means of integration.</v>

126
00:05:10.931 --> 00:05:15.640
<v Speaker 1>And then I think what you're doing is feeding one or the other constantly.</v>

127
00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.510
<v Speaker 1>And I think you probably choose which one to feed.</v>

128
00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.190
<v Speaker 1>I think that's,</v>

129
00:05:21.191 --> 00:05:23.920
<v Speaker 1>and I mean that's how it feels that way to me as well.</v>

130
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.180
<v Speaker 1>Like when I look at my own,</v>

131
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.633
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

132
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.740
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're really aggravated with something,</v>

133
00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.450
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're aggravated with your wife,</v>

134
00:05:31.451 --> 00:05:32.284
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

135
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:32.981
<v Speaker 1>or or,</v>

136
00:05:32.981 --> 00:05:34.720
<v Speaker 1>or your child or something like that,</v>

137
00:05:34.721 --> 00:05:35.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

138
00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:40.260
<v Speaker 1>and you're feeling kind of nasty and maybe even know that you're in the wrong</v>

139
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.890
<v Speaker 1>and an idea comes into your head.</v>

140
00:05:41.891 --> 00:05:43.420
<v Speaker 1>You think I could say that.</v>

141
00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:44.861
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

142
00:05:44.861 --> 00:05:46.930
<v Speaker 1>you could say it and you know what it would do,</v>

143
00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.940
<v Speaker 1>but then you pause and you think,</v>

144
00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.210
<v Speaker 1>would that make it better or worse?</v>

145
00:05:52.211 --> 00:05:53.770
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe you go to hell with it,</v>

146
00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.690
<v Speaker 1>which is quite the thing to say.</v>

147
00:05:55.691 --> 00:05:57.860
<v Speaker 1>I've got a little story about in a minute,</v>

148
00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:59.990
<v Speaker 1>and then you say it,</v>

149
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.190
<v Speaker 1>but you knew,</v>

150
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.130
<v Speaker 1>you knew that you took the low road,</v>

151
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:04.993
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

152
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.900
<v Speaker 1>And you know it,</v>

153
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.790
<v Speaker 1>and then you're guilty about that and defensive.</v>

154
00:06:07.791 --> 00:06:10.900
<v Speaker 1>And that makes the fight way worse because then there's no damn way you're going</v>

155
00:06:10.901 --> 00:06:12.890
<v Speaker 1>to admit that you actually did that.</v>

156
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.780
<v Speaker 1>And so things do go to hell.</v>

157
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:16.003
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

158
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.551
<v Speaker 1>so here's,</v>

159
00:06:16.551 --> 00:06:17.870
<v Speaker 1>here's an ugly little idea.</v>

160
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:19.780
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

161
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:20.450
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

162
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.490
<v Speaker 1>that's relevant to the question.</v>

163
00:06:22.491 --> 00:06:25.940
<v Speaker 1>So imagine you're playing around with cocaine.</v>

164
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.410
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm using cocaine because it's very addictive,</v>

165
00:06:30.411 --> 00:06:34.280
<v Speaker 1>but it's a very interesting chemical because it's a dopaminergic agonist.</v>

166
00:06:34.281 --> 00:06:35.330
<v Speaker 1>And what,</v>

167
00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.550
<v Speaker 1>what dopamine does is two things.</v>

168
00:06:37.551 --> 00:06:40.040
<v Speaker 1>It makes you feel like what you're doing is worthwhile,</v>

169
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:45.050
<v Speaker 1>but it also imagine that there's a bunch of neural circuits that are active and</v>

170
00:06:45.051 --> 00:06:47.840
<v Speaker 1>then they get a hit of dopamine or you do,</v>

171
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.600
<v Speaker 1>then those neurocircuits get a little bit more powerful.</v>

172
00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:51.711
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

173
00:06:51.711 --> 00:06:52.240
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>

174
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.500
<v Speaker 1>it has a rewarding property,</v>

175
00:06:54.501 --> 00:06:58.580
<v Speaker 1>which is that it makes you feel like what you're doing is important and it has a</v>

176
00:06:58.581 --> 00:06:59.780
<v Speaker 1>reinforcing property,</v>

177
00:06:59.781 --> 00:07:00.081
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

178
00:07:00.081 --> 00:07:02.450
<v Speaker 1>it makes neurocircuits growth.</v>

179
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.970
<v Speaker 1>So now what that means is that</v>

180
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.130
<v Speaker 1>whatever you were doing just before you took cocaine grows.</v>

181
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:11.751
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

182
00:07:11.751 --> 00:07:15.170
<v Speaker 1>So now imagine there's a bunch of different things that you do just before you</v>

183
00:07:15.171 --> 00:07:16.010
<v Speaker 1>take cocaine,</v>

184
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:18.590
<v Speaker 1>but there's a string of decisions.</v>

185
00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:23.260
<v Speaker 1>And it one decision point is the same for all of those difference occurrences.</v>

186
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:26.120
<v Speaker 1>And that decision point is because you know you're in trouble.</v>

187
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:28.040
<v Speaker 1>And that decision point is well,</v>

188
00:07:28.041 --> 00:07:28.910
<v Speaker 1>to hell with it.</v>

189
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:30.681
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

190
00:07:30.681 --> 00:07:35.420
<v Speaker 1>So then you think that each of the 200 times that you take cocaine,</v>

191
00:07:35.421 --> 00:07:36.980
<v Speaker 1>even though you do it in different places,</v>

192
00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:39.800
<v Speaker 1>but that one thought is there all the time.</v>

193
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:44.360
<v Speaker 1>And that thing grows because you're reinforcing it and it grows and it grows and</v>

194
00:07:44.361 --> 00:07:45.140
<v Speaker 1>it grows.</v>

195
00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:46.310
<v Speaker 1>And so now that's in you.</v>

196
00:07:46.311 --> 00:07:46.610
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>

197
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:47.480
<v Speaker 1>that's part of you.</v>

198
00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:50.150
<v Speaker 1>And it's the thing that says to hell with it.</v>

199
00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:51.261
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

200
00:07:51.261 --> 00:07:52.094
<v Speaker 1>so now,</v>

201
00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.820
<v Speaker 1>and maybe that's not such a good thing to grow inside your brain.</v>

202
00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:57.500
<v Speaker 1>So then you,</v>

203
00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:00.530
<v Speaker 1>you're addicted and they take you to a cocaine treatment center.</v>

204
00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:01.670
<v Speaker 1>And after a week,</v>

205
00:08:01.671 --> 00:08:02.900
<v Speaker 1>you're no longer physically,</v>

206
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:04.520
<v Speaker 1>physiologically addicted.</v>

207
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:05.750
<v Speaker 1>You're not craving.</v>

208
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.960
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a problem as long as you're there.</v>

209
00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:13.310
<v Speaker 1>But then they take you back to your normal environment and you see like cocaine,</v>

210
00:08:13.311 --> 00:08:13.701
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

211
00:08:13.701 --> 00:08:14.534
<v Speaker 1>your friend.</v>

212
00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:17.210
<v Speaker 1>And as soon as you see him up,</v>

213
00:08:17.211 --> 00:08:18.170
<v Speaker 1>that thing comes in,</v>

214
00:08:18.171 --> 00:08:18.531
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>

215
00:08:18.531 --> 00:08:19.490
<v Speaker 1>you're back on the,</v>

216
00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:23.120
<v Speaker 1>you're back on the to hell with the track.</v>

217
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:24.400
<v Speaker 1>And that's where you're in,</v>

218
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:29.950
<v Speaker 1>where you will end up too if you reinforce that particular perspective long</v>

219
00:08:30.411 --> 00:08:31.190
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>

220
00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:32.610
<v Speaker 1>So that's a,</v>

221
00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:33.810
<v Speaker 1>in a sense to the,</v>

222
00:08:33.811 --> 00:08:35.270
<v Speaker 1>this decision making process.</v>

223
00:08:35.271 --> 00:08:35.930
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

224
00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:36.590
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

225
00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:38.060
<v Speaker 1>if you take the low road,</v>

226
00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:43.130
<v Speaker 1>then that winds and it gets a little stronger because everything that wins</v>

227
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.400
<v Speaker 1>neurologically gets a little stronger.</v>

228
00:08:46.401 --> 00:08:47.960
<v Speaker 1>It's like a Darwinian competition.</v>

229
00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:53.260
<v Speaker 1>So one rule is don't practice what you don't want to become because you really</v>

230
00:08:53.271 --> 00:08:54.500
<v Speaker 1>do become that.</v>

231
00:08:54.501 --> 00:08:55.170
<v Speaker 1>It builds,</v>

232
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:57.930
<v Speaker 1>it builds itself right into your neural architecture.</v>

233
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.390
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the terrifying things about addiction,</v>

234
00:09:00.391 --> 00:09:00.601
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

235
00:09:00.601 --> 00:09:01.081
<v Speaker 1>because you think,</v>

236
00:09:01.081 --> 00:09:01.470
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

237
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:02.580
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of psychological.</v>

238
00:09:02.581 --> 00:09:03.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

239
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:03.571
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

240
00:09:03.571 --> 00:09:04.404
<v Speaker 1>kind of.</v>

241
00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:09.360
<v Speaker 1>It's also kind of neurophysiological and you build a one eyed cocaine monster in</v>

242
00:09:09.361 --> 00:09:13.650
<v Speaker 1>your head if you hit yourself enough with something that reinforcing.</v>
