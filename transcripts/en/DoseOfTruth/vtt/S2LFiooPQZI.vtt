00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.150
<v Speaker 1>Interest rates are how much money costs.</v>

2
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.350
<v Speaker 1>Ali's money doesn't cost very much.</v>

3
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:13.880
<v Speaker 1>People are going to use more of it.</v>

4
00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.500
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty straight forward.</v>

5
00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:16.783
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

6
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.913
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

7
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.430
<v Speaker 1>it takes the breaks off things because it's less expensive to risk.</v>

8
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:25.611
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

9
00:00:25.611 --> 00:00:27.500
<v Speaker 1>that's why government to manipulate the interest rates,</v>

10
00:00:27.501 --> 00:00:27.771
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

11
00:00:27.771 --> 00:00:27.951
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>

12
00:00:27.951 --> 00:00:29.330
<v Speaker 1>when they want to stimulate the economy,</v>

13
00:00:29.331 --> 00:00:32.180
<v Speaker 1>they drive down the interest rates to make money cheaper so that people spend</v>

14
00:00:32.181 --> 00:00:33.014
<v Speaker 1>more of it.</v>

15
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.680
<v Speaker 1>So it certainly contributed to the housing boom,</v>

16
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.770
<v Speaker 1>although I don't think it contributed nearly as much as crookedness did.</v>

17
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.220
<v Speaker 1>It was a combination of radical innovation,</v>

18
00:00:43.221 --> 00:00:44.360
<v Speaker 1>which is always dangerous,</v>

19
00:00:44.361 --> 00:00:48.170
<v Speaker 1>although also necessary and regulatory failure.</v>
