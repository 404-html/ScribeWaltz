00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:07.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.660
<v Speaker 1>what happens in the stock market?</v>

3
00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:09.613
<v Speaker 1>Bubbles.</v>

4
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:11.990
<v Speaker 1>It's too much enthusiasm.</v>

5
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.330
<v Speaker 1>People see an unspecified,</v>

6
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.970
<v Speaker 1>a reward of unspecified magnitude.</v>

7
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.090
<v Speaker 1>So it's like a magic treasure.</v>

8
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.300
<v Speaker 1>That's what happened with the Internet.</v>

9
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.040
<v Speaker 1>The Internet is a magic treasure.</v>

10
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:23.203
<v Speaker 1>True,</v>

11
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.140
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>

12
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.130
<v Speaker 1>Look at Google,</v>

13
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:26.990
<v Speaker 1>they got all the treasure.</v>

14
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:28.670
<v Speaker 1>Everyone knew it was there,</v>

15
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:30.163
<v Speaker 1>thought they knew.</v>

16
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.190
<v Speaker 1>No one knew where it was.</v>

17
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.200
<v Speaker 1>So they're chasing it like Matt,</v>

18
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:33.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

19
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.400
<v Speaker 1>Even an enthusiastic rash.</v>

20
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:36.770
<v Speaker 1>Was it stupid</v>

21
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:39.260
<v Speaker 1>for lots of people?</v>

22
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.490
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't stupid for the people who happen to be in Google.</v>

23
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:45.410
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

24
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.810
<v Speaker 1>so enthusiasm can easily get out of control.</v>

25
00:00:47.811 --> 00:00:49.730
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens when the party gets out of control.</v>

26
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.860
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens.</v>

27
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.660
<v Speaker 1>Enthusiasm makes people impulsive.</v>

28
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.840
<v Speaker 1>It makes them discount the future because today is so great.</v>

29
00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.690
<v Speaker 1>Enthusiasm turns into mania.</v>

30
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:01.341
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>

31
00:01:01.341 --> 00:01:01.821
<v Speaker 1>everybody says,</v>

32
00:01:01.821 --> 00:01:01.941
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

33
00:01:01.941 --> 00:01:02.721
<v Speaker 1>you should be happy.</v>

34
00:01:02.721 --> 00:01:04.700
<v Speaker 1>You should be telling positive effect all the time.</v>

35
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.310
<v Speaker 1>So no wrong pause.</v>

36
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.840
<v Speaker 1>Dab aspect is dangerous.</v>

37
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.100
<v Speaker 1>You're always telling your kids to stop being so happy.</v>

38
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.140
<v Speaker 1>You don't notice it,</v>

39
00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:16.520
<v Speaker 1>but they're running around causing trouble.</v>

40
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.840
<v Speaker 1>They're having a wild time.</v>

41
00:01:17.841 --> 00:01:20.210
<v Speaker 1>They're throwing their arms in the air and they're laughing and they're running</v>

42
00:01:20.211 --> 00:01:20.690
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>

43
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:21.710
<v Speaker 1>they're having fun.</v>

44
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:22.221
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

45
00:01:22.221 --> 00:01:23.054
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

46
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.990
<v Speaker 1>quiet down,</v>

47
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.290
<v Speaker 1>and if you count your disciplinary actions,</v>

48
00:01:27.291 --> 00:01:32.210
<v Speaker 1>you'd be shocked at how often what you're doing is telling your children to stop</v>

49
00:01:32.211 --> 00:01:33.320
<v Speaker 1>having so much fun.</v>

50
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.870
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
