1
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.260
<v Speaker 1>So I guess what I wanted to talk to you about,</v>

2
00:00:08.261 --> 00:00:09.041
<v Speaker 1>what's a few things?</v>

3
00:00:09.041 --> 00:00:09.761
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

4
00:00:09.761 --> 00:00:13.570
<v Speaker 1>I know that your book is coming out in January and I've preordered it.</v>

5
00:00:13.571 --> 00:00:14.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm very excited about that.</v>

6
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.740
<v Speaker 1>So you are going on a book tour that's,</v>

7
00:00:17.741 --> 00:00:18.270
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

8
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.270
<v Speaker 2>just talking to the book is going to be published by penguin counted down also</v>

9
00:00:23.791 --> 00:00:24.511
<v Speaker 2>in the UK,</v>

10
00:00:24.511 --> 00:00:28.180
<v Speaker 2>which I'm really excited about because penguin is a top rate publisher.</v>

11
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.350
<v Speaker 2>We were just having a marketing discussion today.</v>

12
00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:32.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to England in,</v>

13
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.170
<v Speaker 2>in the middle of January as well as to Amsterdam and uh,</v>

14
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.030
<v Speaker 2>we talked about,</v>

15
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.530
<v Speaker 2>so there's two,</v>

16
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing two talks in the UK,</v>

17
00:00:42.211 --> 00:00:42.661
<v Speaker 2>in London,</v>

18
00:00:42.661 --> 00:00:44.340
<v Speaker 2>both of which I think have sold out now.</v>

19
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

20
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.440
<v Speaker 2>three I checked this morning.</v>

21
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.951
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

22
00:00:46.951 --> 00:00:47.460
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

23
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.851
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

24
00:00:47.851 --> 00:00:48.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

25
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.600
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

26
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.660
<v Speaker 2>So the thousand seat venue sold out in about one day,</v>

27
00:00:51.661 --> 00:00:54.360
<v Speaker 2>which is hard to fathom.</v>

28
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.020
<v Speaker 2>And then I talked to them about renting a bus,</v>

29
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.960
<v Speaker 2>having it painted in some,</v>

30
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.153
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

31
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.390
<v Speaker 2>mean like way I suppose I probably not like,</v>

32
00:01:06.391 --> 00:01:09.940
<v Speaker 2>I hope nothing close to what Milo is doing now.</v>

33
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.823
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>

34
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.440
<v Speaker 2>Then I thought I'd run a contest for the bus design.</v>

35
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:14.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

36
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.360
<v Speaker 2>And so they are,</v>

37
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.580
<v Speaker 2>they seem like that.</v>

38
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.210
<v Speaker 2>They seem to think that was a good idea.</v>

39
00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:21.600
<v Speaker 2>And I think I want to do the same thing in the u s so that should be</v>

40
00:01:21.601 --> 00:01:24.210
<v Speaker 2>ridiculously entertaining and surreal.</v>

41
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.090
<v Speaker 1>Bus Tours start.</v>

42
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.720
<v Speaker 1>Would it be next summer or next fall?</v>

43
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.400
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

44
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.971
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

45
00:01:28.971 --> 00:01:31.730
<v Speaker 2>probably next fall in the u s and maybe,</v>

46
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where it went in the UK,</v>

47
00:01:33.771 --> 00:01:34.581
<v Speaker 2>maybe in the spring,</v>

48
00:01:34.581 --> 00:01:37.450
<v Speaker 2>but sometime next year and I'm going to Australia,</v>

49
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.620
<v Speaker 2>New Zealand and I'm sure I'll,</v>

50
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.410
<v Speaker 2>by the looks of things I'll be going all over the place.</v>

51
00:01:42.411 --> 00:01:46.580
<v Speaker 2>And so that's also extremely interesting and somewhat unexpected.</v>

52
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.920
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

53
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.370
<v Speaker 1>so 2018 looks like it's going to be a very adventurous and exciting year for</v>

54
00:01:51.371 --> 00:01:51.940
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

55
00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:52.211
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

56
00:01:52.211 --> 00:01:55.810
<v Speaker 1>You mean like compare it as contrasted to 2017 say,</v>

57
00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.620
<v Speaker 1>well 2017 the latter part was I think been really good.</v>

58
00:01:59.621 --> 00:02:01.420
<v Speaker 1>Like I've attended all your lectures.</v>

59
00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:02.254
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

60
00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.760
<v Speaker 1>the psychological significance of the biblical stories they've been sold out and</v>

61
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:07.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

62
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.110
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

63
00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.280
<v Speaker 1>that's a crazy thing.</v>

64
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:11.680
<v Speaker 1>The question and answer period.</v>

65
00:02:11.681 --> 00:02:13.900
<v Speaker 1>At the end has been so sophisticated,</v>

66
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.610
<v Speaker 1>really in depth questions and the audiences really tuned in and very,</v>

67
00:02:18.611 --> 00:02:23.080
<v Speaker 1>very mature and there's so much respect and silence during the entire lecture.</v>

68
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you're very pleased,</v>

69
00:02:24.591 --> 00:02:25.120
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

70
00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.953
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

71
00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:26.201
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

72
00:02:26.201 --> 00:02:26.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm reading</v>

73
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.900
<v Speaker 2>pleased about it and I've learned a tremendous amount.</v>

74
00:02:28.901 --> 00:02:29.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

75
00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.213
<v Speaker 2>part of the reason I,</v>

76
00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.880
<v Speaker 2>I've wanted to do a series on the psychological significance of the biblical</v>

77
00:02:33.881 --> 00:02:35.680
<v Speaker 2>stories for long time,</v>

78
00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.780
<v Speaker 2>15 years probably,</v>

79
00:02:37.781 --> 00:02:41.560
<v Speaker 2>and never had the opportunity,</v>

80
00:02:41.561 --> 00:02:43.180
<v Speaker 2>never set itself up properly.</v>

81
00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.901
<v Speaker 2>And I've,</v>

82
00:02:43.901 --> 00:02:47.420
<v Speaker 2>I've learned a ridiculous about doing it and I'm really looking forward to</v>

83
00:02:47.421 --> 00:02:48.280
<v Speaker 2>starting it up again.</v>

84
00:02:48.281 --> 00:02:51.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try to do it to go through exodus next year.</v>

85
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.660
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

86
00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.990
<v Speaker 2>I really liked the exodus exists stories and I know them better than I did the</v>

87
00:02:55.991 --> 00:02:56.950
<v Speaker 2>Abrahamic stories,</v>

88
00:02:56.951 --> 00:02:57.784
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

89
00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.843
<v Speaker 2>I had to do a lot of,</v>

90
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.341
<v Speaker 2>but that's okay.</v>

91
00:03:00.341 --> 00:03:01.270
<v Speaker 2>It's often,</v>

92
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.250
<v Speaker 2>it's a funny thing when you're lecturing.</v>

93
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.690
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's,</v>

94
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.411
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

95
00:03:05.411 --> 00:03:09.880
<v Speaker 2>you need to have a fairly wide background of knowledge,</v>

96
00:03:09.881 --> 00:03:10.990
<v Speaker 2>say that you can draw from,</v>

97
00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:11.620
<v Speaker 2>but in,</v>

98
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.090
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

99
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.700
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

100
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.900
<v Speaker 2>in a more specific way.</v>

101
00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:18.280
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's not bad to be just one step ahead of the audience and be learning</v>

102
00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:20.980
<v Speaker 2>along with them because it keeps the material really fresh.</v>

103
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:22.031
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

104
00:03:22.031 --> 00:03:22.864
<v Speaker 2>that's been,</v>

105
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.340
<v Speaker 2>that's been an amazing thing.</v>

106
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how many people have watched those biblical lectures now,</v>

107
00:03:27.221 --> 00:03:29.460
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's something upwards of 5 million.</v>

108
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.961
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

109
00:03:29.961 --> 00:03:30.400
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

110
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.310
<v Speaker 1>that's remarkable.</v>

111
00:03:31.311 --> 00:03:32.144
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

112
00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.050
<v Speaker 1>what's even more remarkable to me is when I attend is the number of young people</v>

113
00:03:36.051 --> 00:03:36.884
<v Speaker 1>in the audience.</v>

114
00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.570
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

115
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.230
<v Speaker 1>that's been really encouraging because I think statistically if we look at</v>

116
00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.093
<v Speaker 1>across the board,</v>

117
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

118
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.980
<v Speaker 1>I know that young people show not a very strong interest in religion or</v>

119
00:03:48.981 --> 00:03:49.850
<v Speaker 1>religious stories.</v>

120
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:50.733
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

121
00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.070
<v Speaker 2>Don't attend church.</v>

122
00:03:52.071 --> 00:03:53.780
<v Speaker 2>And that's especially true for young men.</v>

123
00:03:53.781 --> 00:03:58.370
<v Speaker 2>And I know it's really funny because I'm talking to young men about religion and</v>

124
00:03:58.371 --> 00:04:02.240
<v Speaker 2>responsibility and there there's a huge market for it,</v>

125
00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.313
<v Speaker 2>which is</v>

126
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:05.493
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>

127
00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.973
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me,</v>

128
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.210
<v Speaker 1>teasing on unpredictable,</v>

129
00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.020
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

130
00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.050
<v Speaker 1>A part of me is not surprised because as you know,</v>

131
00:04:15.051 --> 00:04:19.130
<v Speaker 1>I've spent the last like 22 years kind of in various types of social services</v>

132
00:04:19.131 --> 00:04:20.870
<v Speaker 1>from child protection to young offenders.</v>

133
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.240
<v Speaker 1>And the one thing I noticed is I almost saw that people were like starving for</v>

134
00:04:26.241 --> 00:04:29.690
<v Speaker 1>some type of structure and morality and some type of,</v>

135
00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.190
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

136
00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.093
<v Speaker 1>just sort of,</v>

137
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

138
00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.540
<v Speaker 1>way to live their lives in a very meaningful way.</v>

139
00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.420
<v Speaker 1>And that hunger was very apparent to me.</v>

140
00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.580
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize it was that strong until actually you came along and I saw the</v>

141
00:04:43.581 --> 00:04:46.400
<v Speaker 1>response to you worldwide has been phenomenal.</v>

142
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.891
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

143
00:04:46.891 --> 00:04:47.131
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

144
00:04:47.131 --> 00:04:47.480
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

145
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.313
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

146
00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.021
<v Speaker 2>it was something,</v>

147
00:04:49.021 --> 00:04:49.980
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to the,</v>

148
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.130
<v Speaker 2>I call them the penguin people because that's actually quite funny,</v>

149
00:04:53.131 --> 00:04:55.530
<v Speaker 2>but I was talking to the penguin people today.</v>

150
00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.620
<v Speaker 2>They would ask me how I can account for what's happened over the last year,</v>

151
00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:02.173
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

152
00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:03.060
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

153
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:08.250
<v Speaker 2>my sense essentially is that young people haven't been talked intelligently to</v>

154
00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.490
<v Speaker 2>about responsibility and tradition since like 1965 and that's three generations.</v>

155
00:05:14.971 --> 00:05:16.050
<v Speaker 2>It's way too long.</v>

156
00:05:16.051 --> 00:05:19.800
<v Speaker 2>And so they are starving for it because we've missed half the story.</v>

157
00:05:19.801 --> 00:05:20.634
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

158
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:21.050
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

159
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.770
<v Speaker 2>they've been fed a diet of nothing but sugar freedom and impulsive pleasure and,</v>

160
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:27.143
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

161
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.770
<v Speaker 2>and cynicism about,</v>

162
00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.570
<v Speaker 2>about structure and tradition.</v>

163
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.990
<v Speaker 2>And you just can't live like that because freedom and novelty and the unexpected</v>

164
00:05:37.351 --> 00:05:38.250
<v Speaker 2>is half the story.</v>

165
00:05:38.251 --> 00:05:40.720
<v Speaker 2>But structure and predictability and responsibilities,</v>

166
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.060
<v Speaker 2>the other half and you,</v>

167
00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.320
<v Speaker 2>you have to have both.</v>

168
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:44.880
<v Speaker 2>Both halves of the story told</v>

169
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:45.671
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

170
00:05:45.671 --> 00:05:50.671
<v Speaker 1>your detractors are saying that 90% of your audience is male and most of them</v>

171
00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:52.870
<v Speaker 1>are white male.</v>

172
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.610
<v Speaker 1>I really don't understand why that's an issue.</v>

173
00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:57.020
<v Speaker 2>I also don't think it's,</v>

174
00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.273
<v Speaker 2>it's funny.</v>

175
00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.030
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

176
00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.361
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

177
00:05:59.361 --> 00:06:02.780
<v Speaker 2>I was going through my Twitter followers yesterday because I,</v>

178
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm sending some of them books and I used a program that helped me identify the</v>

179
00:06:08.991 --> 00:06:09.824
<v Speaker 2>most,</v>

180
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.300
<v Speaker 2>sort of a combination of my most influential Twitter followers and also those</v>

181
00:06:14.301 --> 00:06:18.050
<v Speaker 2>who are most likely to be engaged with my material.</v>

182
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.500
<v Speaker 2>And so I identified about 200 of them and you know,</v>

183
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:24.800
<v Speaker 2>there were some pretty right wing types in there.</v>

184
00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:25.070
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

185
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:26.780
<v Speaker 2>three or four of them pretty right wing.</v>

186
00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:28.160
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

187
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.940
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

188
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:33.260
<v Speaker 2>three of them were a transsexual porn stars.</v>

189
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:34.820
<v Speaker 2>Really,</v>

190
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.340
<v Speaker 2>really interesting because you know,</v>

191
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.190
<v Speaker 2>if you looked at the three kind of radical right wingers,</v>

192
00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:40.611
<v Speaker 2>you'd say,</v>

193
00:06:40.611 --> 00:06:41.090
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

194
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.300
<v Speaker 2>Dr. Peterson attracts radical right wing and followers.</v>

195
00:06:44.301 --> 00:06:45.260
<v Speaker 2>But then,</v>

196
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:45.711
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

197
00:06:45.711 --> 00:06:46.071
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

198
00:06:46.071 --> 00:06:49.490
<v Speaker 2>what you're going to say about the transsexual porn stars,</v>

199
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.860
<v Speaker 2>literally there were three of them thought,</v>

200
00:06:51.861 --> 00:06:52.460
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

201
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:53.000
<v Speaker 2>what do I,</v>

202
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.790
<v Speaker 2>what am I like tarred with the,</v>

203
00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:01.300
<v Speaker 2>with the association transsexual Porn Stars because that seems to be just as as</v>

204
00:07:01.761 --> 00:07:02.630
<v Speaker 2>big a group.</v>

205
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.943
<v Speaker 2>So it's just,</v>

206
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:04.851
<v Speaker 2>I think Serena,</v>

207
00:07:04.851 --> 00:07:08.450
<v Speaker 2>part of what it is is that if you stand up against the radical left,</v>

208
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.433
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

209
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:14.420
<v Speaker 2>then it isn't obvious where you're positioned on the political spectrum because</v>

210
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:18.200
<v Speaker 2>everybody to the right of the radical left is going to agree with you and</v>

211
00:07:18.201 --> 00:07:20.120
<v Speaker 2>that'll include people on the radical,</v>

212
00:07:20.121 --> 00:07:20.954
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

213
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:21.800
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

214
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.080
<v Speaker 2>And then people say,</v>

215
00:07:24.081 --> 00:07:24.201
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

216
00:07:24.201 --> 00:07:24.651
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>

217
00:07:24.651 --> 00:07:27.200
<v Speaker 2>you've got people on the radical right supporting you.</v>

218
00:07:27.201 --> 00:07:28.370
<v Speaker 2>You must be radical.</v>

219
00:07:28.371 --> 00:07:28.731
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

220
00:07:28.731 --> 00:07:30.500
<v Speaker 2>And it's a reasonable question,</v>

221
00:07:30.501 --> 00:07:31.334
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

222
00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.860
<v Speaker 2>but it's generally not posed in a reasonable way.</v>

223
00:07:33.861 --> 00:07:34.491
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

224
00:07:34.491 --> 00:07:37.130
<v Speaker 2>you obviously you were out the free speech rally.</v>

225
00:07:37.131 --> 00:07:38.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>

226
00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:43.820
<v Speaker 2>there was no evidence whatsoever that the crowd we attracted was anything other</v>

227
00:07:43.821 --> 00:07:48.821
<v Speaker 2>than pretty damn stable center of the road citizens.</v>

228
00:07:49.131 --> 00:07:50.110
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

229
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.050
<v Speaker 2>the other thing about,</v>

230
00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:56.470
<v Speaker 2>about someone's audiences that to assume that I'm mostly appealing to people say</v>

231
00:07:58.821 --> 00:07:59.780
<v Speaker 2>who are right wing.</v>

232
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:05.560
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to show that the number of people that I'm attracting who are right</v>

233
00:08:05.721 --> 00:08:08.870
<v Speaker 2>wing is somehow bigger than it is in the normal population.</v>

234
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:09.980
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

235
00:08:09.981 --> 00:08:11.570
<v Speaker 2>that's not self evident to me.</v>

236
00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:12.291
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

237
00:08:12.291 --> 00:08:12.501
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

238
00:08:12.501 --> 00:08:13.131
<v Speaker 2>and well,</v>

239
00:08:13.131 --> 00:08:13.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

240
00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:14.570
<v Speaker 2>just to some degree,</v>

241
00:08:14.571 --> 00:08:18.080
<v Speaker 2>I think it's beside the point because a lot of what's happening is that the</v>

242
00:08:18.081 --> 00:08:22.430
<v Speaker 2>people who really misunderstand what I'm talking about purposefully or</v>

243
00:08:22.431 --> 00:08:27.431
<v Speaker 2>accidentally or maliciously are looking for any means whatsoever to discredit</v>

244
00:08:29.121 --> 00:08:29.391
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

245
00:08:29.391 --> 00:08:30.224
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

246
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:30.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

247
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.410
<v Speaker 2>fortunately that has not worked at all.</v>

248
00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:34.603
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

249
00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:35.810
<v Speaker 2>Not working in the least.</v>
