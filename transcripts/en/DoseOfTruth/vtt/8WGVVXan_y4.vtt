1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:00.973
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

2
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.890
<v Speaker 2>What is the experience of believing in</v>
<v Speaker 2>God and how is that qualitatively,</v>

3
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:15.020
<v Speaker 2>qualitatively different from a person</v>
<v Speaker 2>who says that he doesn't?</v>

4
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.150
<v Speaker 1>I see what you mean by that is that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the question.</v>

5
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.090
<v Speaker 1>The question is here while the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When someone says,</v>

6
00:00:21.091 --> 00:00:23.340
<v Speaker 1>do you believe in God?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

7
00:00:23.341 --> 00:00:28.341
<v Speaker 1>there's three parts to that question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first question is who is the you to</v>

8
00:00:28.551 --> 00:00:31.820
<v Speaker 1>which they are referring?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let turns out to not be it.</v>

9
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.610
<v Speaker 1>A simple question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Neesha did a very good job of</v>

10
00:00:35.611 --> 00:00:38.190
<v Speaker 1>taking apart the idea of the eye,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.100
<v Speaker 1>because he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was critiquing descartes' I think</v>

12
00:00:41.101 --> 00:00:43.050
<v Speaker 1>therefore I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

13
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.300
<v Speaker 1>and so the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first question is,</v>

14
00:00:45.301 --> 00:00:46.950
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is the you to which you are</v>

15
00:00:46.951 --> 00:00:48.990
<v Speaker 1>referring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second is what do you mean by</v>

16
00:00:48.991 --> 00:00:51.330
<v Speaker 1>belief?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The third is what do you mean by God?</v>

17
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can't just leap to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>assumption that the person asking the</v>

18
00:00:56.371 --> 00:01:00.660
<v Speaker 1>question and the person answering the</v>
<v Speaker 1>question have the same views on those</v>

19
00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:04.240
<v Speaker 1>and I think that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the reason why I don't</v>

20
00:01:04.241 --> 00:01:05.080
<v Speaker 1>like the question.</v>

21
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.950
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

22
00:01:05.951 --> 00:01:10.870
<v Speaker 1>well I act as if I believe in God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I would say that's the more,</v>

23
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.020
<v Speaker 1>that's the most fundamental</v>
<v Speaker 1>manifestation of faith,</v>

24
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.700
<v Speaker 1>but I could also say I believe and don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in God and saying,</v>

25
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:19.663
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

26
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.030
<v Speaker 1>You can't think both of those things at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same time.</v>

27
00:01:23.031 --> 00:01:23.711
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

28
00:01:23.711 --> 00:01:26.210
<v Speaker 1>hell yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you think.</v>

29
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.443
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

30
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.700
<v Speaker 1>it's in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

31
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.000
<v Speaker 1>When you were asking something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated,</v>

32
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.610
<v Speaker 1>then there's absolutely no reason to</v>
<v Speaker 1>assume that you can't have paradoxical</v>

33
00:01:37.611 --> 00:01:40.380
<v Speaker 1>responses to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could.</v>

34
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.530
<v Speaker 1>You could even say maybe that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>injunction in the old testament is</v>

35
00:01:43.531 --> 00:01:45.630
<v Speaker 1>something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should believe that not believe in</v>

36
00:01:45.631 --> 00:01:48.430
<v Speaker 1>God [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very complicated.</v>

37
00:01:48.431 --> 00:01:51.610
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not by any means.</v>

38
00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:53.400
<v Speaker 1>A simple question.</v>

39
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember his name though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think perhaps it was a burger or</v>

40
00:01:59.561 --> 00:02:04.170
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said that myth is about reconciling</v>

41
00:02:04.171 --> 00:02:06.440
<v Speaker 2>contradictions within the human.</v>

42
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.760
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly.</v>

43
00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.100
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what a successful myth does and</v>

44
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.370
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason that these ideologies</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we've been discussing feminism</v>

45
00:02:17.451 --> 00:02:21.790
<v Speaker 1>power so much power is because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually draw their motive force from an</v>

46
00:02:21.791 --> 00:02:25.250
<v Speaker 1>underlying religious substrate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they only tell half the story and</v>

47
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.820
<v Speaker 1>that's what ended theology is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when the feminists say,</v>

48
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.900
<v Speaker 1>culture is that tyrannical patriarch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

49
00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:31.740
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true,</v>

50
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.050
<v Speaker 1>but it's also the benevolent wise king.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

51
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.190
<v Speaker 1>well then they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

52
00:02:39.191 --> 00:02:41.350
<v Speaker 1>I can't be one and the other at the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

53
00:02:41.351 --> 00:02:42.190
<v Speaker 1>and the answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

54
00:02:42.191 --> 00:02:46.390
<v Speaker 1>it's a multidimensional phenomena that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're encapsulating within a single</v>

55
00:02:46.391 --> 00:02:49.060
<v Speaker 1>category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can contain contradictions.</v>

56
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.340
<v Speaker 1>In fact it does because society</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously constraints and and kills you</v>

57
00:02:56.231 --> 00:03:00.050
<v Speaker 1>even like you dye into your neural</v>
<v Speaker 1>configuration because when you were</v>

58
00:03:00.051 --> 00:03:03.320
<v Speaker 1>first born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have more neural connections than</v>

59
00:03:03.321 --> 00:03:06.840
<v Speaker 1>you will ever in your life and most of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them die.</v>

60
00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.460
<v Speaker 1>And so so you dye into your four year</v>
<v Speaker 1>old self and then between the ages of 16</v>

61
00:03:13.611 --> 00:03:15.830
<v Speaker 1>and 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you dye into your adult self.</v>

62
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.710
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea that the society that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in is a terrible tyrant.</v>

63
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:23.980
<v Speaker 1>That shapes you by death is exactly</v>
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>

64
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.610
<v Speaker 1>but by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also almost everything that</v>

65
00:03:27.611 --> 00:03:30.340
<v Speaker 1>ennobles you and enables you to function</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>

66
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.930
<v Speaker 1>And so the critic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>critics of the Patriarchy say tyranny,</v>

67
00:03:34.931 --> 00:03:35.870
<v Speaker 1>tyranny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tyranny.</v>

68
00:03:35.871 --> 00:03:36.491
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

69
00:03:36.491 --> 00:03:37.330
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tyranny,</v>

70
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.350
<v Speaker 1>but not only tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they say evil man,</v>

71
00:03:42.351 --> 00:03:43.340
<v Speaker 1>evil man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

72
00:03:43.341 --> 00:03:44.330
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>

73
00:03:44.331 --> 00:03:47.600
<v Speaker 1>but not only evil man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

74
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.190
<v Speaker 1>and that's why a genuine mythologies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would put Freudian Psycho analysis</v>

75
00:03:53.631 --> 00:03:58.020
<v Speaker 1>in that category because Freud had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very balanced view of the nature of</v>

76
00:03:58.021 --> 00:04:02.790
<v Speaker 1>being</v>
<v Speaker 1>talks about both parts of the paradox at</v>

77
00:04:02.791 --> 00:04:04.290
<v Speaker 1>the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

78
00:04:04.291 --> 00:04:08.730
<v Speaker 1>it's the dragon and the gold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the terrible devouring mother and</v>

79
00:04:08.731 --> 00:04:10.230
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Virgin Mary.</v>

80
00:04:10.231 --> 00:04:13.850
<v Speaker 1>It's the tyrant and the wise king.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Christ and sait.</v>

81
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.370
<v Speaker 1>It's all of those paradoxes stacked on</v>
<v Speaker 1>top of one another.</v>

82
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.300
<v Speaker 1>And then the story about how you go</v>
<v Speaker 1>about dealing with them.</v>

83
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:23.170
<v Speaker 1>That's a true religious myth.</v>

84
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

85
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.510
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the dog just takes a part of that</v>

86
00:04:27.511 --> 00:04:28.920
<v Speaker 1>and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the whole.</v>

87
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.810
<v Speaker 2>In early Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a large battle between many</v>

88
00:04:34.811 --> 00:04:36.080
<v Speaker 2>keiths and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

89
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.400
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what would turn out to be the</v>

90
00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.340
<v Speaker 2>Catholic Church and the mainstream</v>
<v Speaker 2>church and,</v>

91
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.610
<v Speaker 2>and they said that the evil evil was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world we live in is created by this</v>

92
00:04:50.711 --> 00:04:55.260
<v Speaker 2>other force,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the demiurge so that the,</v>

93
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.940
<v Speaker 2>they had a very split vision of good and</v>
<v Speaker 2>evil.</v>

94
00:04:59.941 --> 00:05:04.550
<v Speaker 2>But what you're saying and what you were</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying about these ideologies is that</v>

95
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.620
<v Speaker 2>basically it's perhaps it's a new formal</v>
<v Speaker 2>theological battle between glowsticks</v>

96
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.750
<v Speaker 2>and the people that say that this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have both sides,</v>

97
00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.570
<v Speaker 1>both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a perfectly reasonable way of</v>

98
00:05:17.571 --> 00:05:18.470
<v Speaker 1>looking at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

99
00:05:18.471 --> 00:05:22.610
<v Speaker 1>and like young tended towards Manichaean</v>
<v Speaker 1>as to some degree because he was so</v>

100
00:05:22.611 --> 00:05:25.690
<v Speaker 1>struck by say the evils of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of have nazi-ism.</v>

101
00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.600
<v Speaker 1>And he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a hard time with the idea that</v>

102
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.270
<v Speaker 1>evil was only the absence of good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

103
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.740
<v Speaker 1>and I thought about that a lot because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a great admirer of Yoga and you</v>

104
00:05:35.741 --> 00:05:38.200
<v Speaker 1>criticize anything he said at your</v>
<v Speaker 1>peril,</v>

105
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he was a great genius.</v>

106
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.840
<v Speaker 1>But I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the Manichaean view is wrong.</v>

107
00:05:43.841 --> 00:05:47.050
<v Speaker 1>I think that what evil is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the absence of good.</v>

108
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.300
<v Speaker 1>And then it takes on its own life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

109
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've written about this in my new book</v>

110
00:05:53.231 --> 00:05:56.860
<v Speaker 1>quite extensively because I have a book</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming out in January called 12 rules</v>

111
00:05:56.861 --> 00:06:00.110
<v Speaker 1>for life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an antidote to chaos and I'd be trying</v>

112
00:06:00.111 --> 00:06:02.900
<v Speaker 1>to take those ideas apart and to grapple</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

113
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.990
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the fact that human beings hate</v>

114
00:06:05.991 --> 00:06:08.390
<v Speaker 1>themselves because they're vulnerable</v>
<v Speaker 1>and malevolent,</v>

115
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.370
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is original sin,</v>

116
00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:12.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something I'm a great believer</v>

117
00:06:12.741 --> 00:06:13.490
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

118
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's an unbelievably</v>

119
00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:19.220
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated way of looking at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

120
00:06:19.221 --> 00:06:20.240
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's something</v>

121
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.540
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was something damaged in the</v>

122
00:06:23.541 --> 00:06:25.240
<v Speaker 1>fabric of being itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

123
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.400
<v Speaker 1>I believe that to be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we experienced that as human</v>

124
00:06:28.401 --> 00:06:33.401
<v Speaker 1>beings and that our ethical obligation</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to rectify that and to determine how</v>

125
00:06:35.571 --> 00:06:38.750
<v Speaker 1>to rectify that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to overcome the vulnerability and</v>

126
00:06:38.751 --> 00:06:42.290
<v Speaker 1>malevolence that like the terror of</v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability and the subjection to</v>

127
00:06:42.291 --> 00:06:45.050
<v Speaker 1>malevolence that characterizes our day</v>
<v Speaker 1>to day existence.</v>

128
00:06:45.051 --> 00:06:49.160
<v Speaker 1>That's our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's our primary mode of proper being</v>

129
00:06:49.161 --> 00:06:51.680
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems to me to be correct.</v>

130
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:53.600
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

131
00:06:53.601 --> 00:06:55.700
<v Speaker 1>that's the sort of thing that I've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to tell.</v>

132
00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.430
<v Speaker 1>Well those who will listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

133
00:06:58.431 --> 00:07:01.820
<v Speaker 1>but it's so far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's mostly been young men who are dying</v>

134
00:07:01.821 --> 00:07:04.280
<v Speaker 1>for this message.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they're dying for it,</v>

135
00:07:04.281 --> 00:07:07.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really Connie's,</v>

136
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.230
<v Speaker 1>I go to these talks now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

137
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.560
<v Speaker 1>public talks and where I speak about</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and truth and like after</v>

138
00:07:15.231 --> 00:07:16.160
<v Speaker 1>the talks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are</v>

139
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:22.700
<v Speaker 1>crowds of mostly young men who line up</v>
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>

140
00:07:22.701 --> 00:07:24.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was nihilistic,</v>

141
00:07:24.111 --> 00:07:26.000
<v Speaker 1>I was desperate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was suicidal,</v>

142
00:07:26.001 --> 00:07:30.710
<v Speaker 1>I was malevolent and resentful and like</v>
<v Speaker 1>going bad places.</v>

143
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:34.850
<v Speaker 1>And I've started listening to what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been saying about myth and it's</v>

144
00:07:34.851 --> 00:07:38.150
<v Speaker 1>like brought me out of that horrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>hole.</v>

145
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.540
<v Speaker 1>And it's just one person after another</v>
<v Speaker 1>says the same thing.</v>

146
00:07:41.541 --> 00:07:42.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so,</v>

147
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.780
<v Speaker 1>and I've had thousands of letters like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and maybe tens of thousands now I</v>

148
00:07:47.781 --> 00:07:52.550
<v Speaker 1>can't even begin to keep up with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And well,</v>

149
00:07:52.551 --> 00:07:53.800
<v Speaker 1>thank God for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>
