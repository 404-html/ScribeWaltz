1
00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:08.523
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.970
<v Speaker 1>there were elements in my character that are optimistic.</v>

3
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:12.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:12.990
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

5
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.501
<v Speaker 1>I've looked,</v>

6
00:00:13.501 --> 00:00:14.161
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

7
00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:18.390
<v Speaker 1>I worked for a UN committee on the relationship between economic development,</v>

8
00:00:18.391 --> 00:00:21.960
<v Speaker 1>sustainability and I found out a variety of things that were very optimistic.</v>

9
00:00:21.961 --> 00:00:22.800
<v Speaker 1>Like the sock that,</v>

10
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:23.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:23.551 --> 00:00:28.551
<v Speaker 1>the UN set out to have poverty between 2000 and 2015 worldwide and actually hit</v>

12
00:00:29.221 --> 00:00:31.020
<v Speaker 1>that by about 2010 right?</v>

13
00:00:31.021 --> 00:00:35.100
<v Speaker 1>So we're in that period of the fastest transformation of the bottom strata of</v>

14
00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:38.940
<v Speaker 1>the world's population into something approximating middleclass that's ever</v>

15
00:00:38.941 --> 00:00:39.690
<v Speaker 1>occurred.</v>

16
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.530
<v Speaker 1>And there's all these great technological innovations on the horizon and it</v>

17
00:00:43.531 --> 00:00:47.220
<v Speaker 1>looks to me like things could go extraordinarily well if we were careful,</v>

18
00:00:47.221 --> 00:00:50.580
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not optimistic and maybe that's me.</v>

19
00:00:50.581 --> 00:00:54.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm pessimistic because I also see that there's five or six things happening,</v>

20
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.950
<v Speaker 1>all of which appear at the level of catastrophe that are all happening at the</v>

21
00:00:58.951 --> 00:00:59.580
<v Speaker 1>same time.</v>

22
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.720
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that I'd like to ask you is like what do you see</v>

23
00:01:03.721 --> 00:01:05.850
<v Speaker 1>happening in the next 10 years in,</v>

24
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.770
<v Speaker 1>in the universities are in culture at large.</v>

25
00:01:07.771 --> 00:01:08.551
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>

26
00:01:08.551 --> 00:01:11.730
<v Speaker 1>you just put forward a proposal for the universities for the treatment of women,</v>

27
00:01:11.731 --> 00:01:12.990
<v Speaker 1>which I think is very interesting.</v>

28
00:01:12.991 --> 00:01:15.300
<v Speaker 1>One because women do have a different timeframe than men,</v>

29
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.870
<v Speaker 1>but like what the hell is the proper way forward?</v>

30
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.620
<v Speaker 1>I've been encouraging young men to tell the truth and to take responsibility and</v>

31
00:01:22.621 --> 00:01:24.600
<v Speaker 1>there's a huge market for that message.</v>

32
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.200
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

33
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.940
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not convinced by any stretch of the imagination that it's enough.</v>

34
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.720
<v Speaker 1>What like when you look forward and you try to be optimistic,</v>

35
00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:34.890
<v Speaker 1>what the hell do you see?</v>

36
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.801
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

37
00:01:35.801 --> 00:01:38.500
<v Speaker 2>and in the largest scale,</v>

38
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:39.410
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

39
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm concerned about the future of Western culture because as a student of</v>

40
00:01:44.861 --> 00:01:45.341
<v Speaker 2>history,</v>

41
00:01:45.341 --> 00:01:45.520
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

42
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.560
<v Speaker 2>it looks too much to me like ancient Rome.</v>

43
00:01:47.561 --> 00:01:47.741
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

44
00:01:47.741 --> 00:01:49.570
<v Speaker 2>Would you became overexpanded,</v>

45
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:50.141
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

46
00:01:50.141 --> 00:01:50.974
<v Speaker 2>which became an,</v>

47
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.000
<v Speaker 2>was at the mercy of,</v>

48
00:01:52.001 --> 00:01:52.181
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

49
00:01:52.181 --> 00:01:53.380
<v Speaker 2>of bureaucratic,</v>

50
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.273
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

51
00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:55.360
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

52
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.511
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

53
00:01:55.511 --> 00:01:56.230
<v Speaker 2>the creep.</v>

54
00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.870
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

55
00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:57.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

56
00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.430
<v Speaker 2>And I can imagine one of this yesterday and it,</v>

57
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.830
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

58
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:01.400
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

59
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.060
<v Speaker 2>and Roman identity eventually,</v>

60
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.570
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

61
00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:05.770
<v Speaker 2>got blur and okay.</v>

62
00:02:05.771 --> 00:02:06.051
<v Speaker 2>In the,</v>

63
00:02:06.051 --> 00:02:08.860
<v Speaker 2>in its incorporation of so many different cultures,</v>

64
00:02:08.861 --> 00:02:11.290
<v Speaker 2>which at first seemed like a healthy kind of multiculturalism,</v>

65
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.330
<v Speaker 2>but eventually overexpand and simply collapse of its own way.</v>

66
00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.700
<v Speaker 2>I and I,</v>

67
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.800
<v Speaker 2>so I am concerned about the,</v>

68
00:02:17.801 --> 00:02:18.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

69
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.190
<v Speaker 2>whether Western culture is in a rapid decline.</v>

70
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.450
<v Speaker 2>I think it would be very easy because we are so interconnected and so</v>

71
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.160
<v Speaker 2>overcomplex very easy,</v>

72
00:02:27.161 --> 00:02:27.311
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

73
00:02:27.311 --> 00:02:31.200
<v Speaker 2>to bring it to ruin it would only take one major natural disaster.</v>

74
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.500
<v Speaker 2>We're going to do that.</v>

75
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.000
<v Speaker 2>But the University of themselves,</v>

76
00:02:34.001 --> 00:02:34.151
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

77
00:02:34.151 --> 00:02:34.811
<v Speaker 2>I think people are,</v>

78
00:02:34.811 --> 00:02:36.940
<v Speaker 2>are all of a sudden in the United States,</v>

79
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:38.410
<v Speaker 2>much more,</v>

80
00:02:38.411 --> 00:02:38.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

81
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.390
<v Speaker 2>attentive to issues of political correctness because of the,</v>

82
00:02:42.391 --> 00:02:43.540
<v Speaker 2>the riots at Berkeley,</v>

83
00:02:43.541 --> 00:02:44.374
<v Speaker 2>which was the,</v>

84
00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

85
00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.420
<v Speaker 2>which was the capital of free speech.</v>

86
00:02:46.421 --> 00:02:46.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

87
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.491
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean the,</v>

88
00:02:47.491 --> 00:02:49.740
<v Speaker 2>the free speech movement happened in the spring,</v>

89
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:50.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

90
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.370
<v Speaker 2>before I entered college in 1964 to one of the great principles and the,</v>

91
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.350
<v Speaker 2>in the inspirational stories in my entire life.</v>

92
00:02:56.351 --> 00:02:57.340
<v Speaker 2>Mario Savio was,</v>

93
00:02:57.341 --> 00:02:57.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

94
00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.761
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

95
00:02:57.761 --> 00:02:58.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

96
00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.013
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

97
00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

98
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.081
<v Speaker 2>assertion of,</v>

99
00:03:00.081 --> 00:03:00.271
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

100
00:03:00.271 --> 00:03:00.911
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>

101
00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:02.560
<v Speaker 2>of the supremacy of,</v>

102
00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:02.771
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

103
00:03:02.771 --> 00:03:04.110
<v Speaker 2>free thought and free speech.</v>

104
00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.250
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

105
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.940
<v Speaker 2>I though I think then perhaps,</v>

106
00:03:06.941 --> 00:03:07.331
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

107
00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:07.541
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

108
00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:09.240
<v Speaker 2>we might just have turned a corner,</v>

109
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.270
<v Speaker 2>but it's going to take a very,</v>

110
00:03:10.271 --> 00:03:12.250
<v Speaker 2>very long time for the university to be reformed.</v>

111
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.220
<v Speaker 2>I feel that the cafeteria menu,</v>

112
00:03:15.221 --> 00:03:15.610
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

113
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.941
<v Speaker 2>Of,</v>

114
00:03:15.941 --> 00:03:16.241
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

115
00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:16.420
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

116
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.260
<v Speaker 2>the university curriculum has to be abandoned.</v>

117
00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.890
<v Speaker 2>We must return to historical,</v>

118
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

119
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:26.230
<v Speaker 2>courses that begin in the earliest period in the Stone Age and antiquity in</v>

120
00:03:26.231 --> 00:03:27.310
<v Speaker 2>order to give perspective,</v>

121
00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:27.461
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

122
00:03:27.461 --> 00:03:27.671
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

123
00:03:27.671 --> 00:03:28.000
<v Speaker 2>to our,</v>

124
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.430
<v Speaker 2>to our present doing analysis of our president and culture.</v>

125
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:31.510
<v Speaker 2>I want,</v>

126
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.140
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

127
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

128
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.951
<v Speaker 2>50,</v>

129
00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:35.830
<v Speaker 2>50 to 75% of college administrators fired.</v>

130
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:36.430
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

131
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.440
<v Speaker 2>And the money be transferred over okay.</v>

132
00:03:38.441 --> 00:03:39.050
<v Speaker 2>To,</v>

133
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.430
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

134
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.641
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

135
00:03:39.641 --> 00:03:42.550
<v Speaker 2>to faculty and to libraries and two into two instruction.</v>

136
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:43.300
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

137
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.790
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

138
00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:44.650
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>

139
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.250
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

140
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

141
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.570
<v Speaker 2>obviously the way things are being people are being trained right now,</v>

142
00:03:49.571 --> 00:03:51.070
<v Speaker 2>including at the public school level.</v>

143
00:03:51.071 --> 00:03:51.710
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

144
00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.040
<v Speaker 2>Is I think that might think the public school level has gone to hell.</v>

145
00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.400
<v Speaker 2>And when my,</v>

146
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.571
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

147
00:03:54.571 --> 00:03:54.741
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

148
00:03:54.741 --> 00:03:54.911
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

149
00:03:54.911 --> 00:03:55.780
<v Speaker 2>when my mother came,</v>

154
00:04:02.661 --> 00:04:04.420
<v Speaker 2>an excellent education,</v>

155
00:04:04.421 --> 00:04:05.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

156

<v Speaker 2>in her,</v>

160
00:04:07.991 --> 00:04:08.620
<v Speaker 2>in her,</v>

161
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.600
<v Speaker 2>even though she started on not speaking English,</v>

162
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.010
<v Speaker 2>spoke without an accent,</v>

163
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.520
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>

164
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.671
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

165
00:04:12.671 --> 00:04:13.360
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

166
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.320
<v Speaker 2>so today this,</v>

167
00:04:14.321 --> 00:04:18.000
<v Speaker 2>this kind of feel good public school education at which is,</v>

168
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.800
<v Speaker 2>which is a form of ideology in inductor nation right now.</v>

169
00:04:20.801 --> 00:04:22.600
<v Speaker 2>So it's all about the no bullying.</v>

170
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.871
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

171
00:04:22.871 --> 00:04:23.780
<v Speaker 2>And it's not about,</v>

172
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.080
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

173
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

174
00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.970
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>

175
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.620
<v Speaker 2>I can tell them in my own students,</v>

176
00:04:29.621 --> 00:04:29.801
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

177
00:04:29.801 --> 00:04:31.180
<v Speaker 2>I've been teaching for 46 years,</v>

178
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.380
<v Speaker 2>so I can tell this slow degradation of public school education.</v>

179
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.511
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

180
00:04:35.511 --> 00:04:37.380
<v Speaker 2>Until they get to the point now that the,</v>

181
00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.460
<v Speaker 2>that the students have absolutely no sense of world geography of world history</v>

182
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.650
<v Speaker 2>and they know absolutely nothing.</v>

183
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.240
<v Speaker 2>They don't know anything about wars and the reality,</v>

184
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.570
<v Speaker 2>the barbaric reality of most of human history.</v>

185
00:04:49.571 --> 00:04:49.830
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

186
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:50.670
<v Speaker 2>And one of,</v>

187
00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:52.653
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

188
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.700
<v Speaker 2>what a fantastic culture we live in.</v>

189
00:04:54.701 --> 00:04:55.650
<v Speaker 2>And so now it doesn't,</v>

190
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.820
<v Speaker 2>identity politics itself has just got to stop.</v>

191
00:04:57.821 --> 00:04:58.031
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

192
00:04:58.031 --> 00:04:59.440
<v Speaker 2>they was important once.</v>

193
00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:00.303
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

194
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.450
<v Speaker 2>I was a rebel against the wasp hegemony.</v>

195
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.880
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

196
00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.820
<v Speaker 2>White Anglo Saxon Protestant of Germany.</v>

197
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.290
<v Speaker 2>In American culture it was,</v>

198
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.610
<v Speaker 2>it was suffocating.</v>

199
00:05:09.611 --> 00:05:14.611
<v Speaker 2>I was raised in the 1950s or they went when wasps controlled corporations and,</v>

200
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.770
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

201
00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.890
<v Speaker 2>and education and politics and so on.</v>

202
00:05:17.891 --> 00:05:20.440
<v Speaker 2>And so identity politics was necessary once.</v>

203
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.040
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

204
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.580
<v Speaker 2>To do it.</v>

205
00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.530
<v Speaker 2>We asserted gay rights.</v>

206
00:05:23.531 --> 00:05:23.831
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

207
00:05:23.831 --> 00:05:24.141
<v Speaker 2>And he was,</v>

208
00:05:24.141 --> 00:05:26.480
<v Speaker 2>it was stonewall rebellion of 1969 we have sir,</v>

209
00:05:26.481 --> 00:05:27.340
<v Speaker 2>we asserted,</v>

210
00:05:27.341 --> 00:05:27.611
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

211
00:05:27.611 --> 00:05:29.260
<v Speaker 2>The women's rights with the,</v>

212
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.650
<v Speaker 2>with the,</v>

213
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.800
<v Speaker 2>with the rebirth of second wave feminism in the late 1960s okay.</v>

214
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.240
<v Speaker 2>But there's endless,</v>

215
00:05:34.241 --> 00:05:34.451
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

216
00:05:34.451 --> 00:05:35.550
<v Speaker 2>Preoccupation with,</v>

217
00:05:35.551 --> 00:05:37.510
<v Speaker 2>with a fragmented identity,</v>

218
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.370
<v Speaker 2>we must return to the authentic,</v>

219
00:05:39.371 --> 00:05:39.740
<v Speaker 2>that six,</v>

220
00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:40.450
<v Speaker 2>his vision,</v>

221
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:45.100
<v Speaker 2>which is about identity coming from a consciousness which transcends gender,</v>

222
00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.250
<v Speaker 2>which transcends all these divisions of race.</v>

223
00:05:48.251 --> 00:05:49.084
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

224
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:50.030
<v Speaker 2>Ethnicity.</v>

225
00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:50.860
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

226
00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.180
<v Speaker 2>Consciousness itself.</v>

227
00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.630
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

228
00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:53.010
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

229
00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:55.320
<v Speaker 2>Then there's no sense of that any longer.</v>

230
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 2>That's what the 1960 sauce I see of that is</v>

231
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.680
<v Speaker 1>a complete abandonment of personal responsibility.</v>

232
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:01.040
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

233
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.170
<v Speaker 1>Because like that consciousness,</v>

234
00:06:03.171 --> 00:06:04.280
<v Speaker 1>I think symbolically,</v>

235
00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:06.770
<v Speaker 1>and I got a lot of this from yoga and also for Merrick noise.</v>

236
00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the great logos of the West,</v>

237
00:06:08.811 --> 00:06:09.021
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

238
00:06:09.021 --> 00:06:10.550
<v Speaker 1>That's the transcendent principle,</v>

239
00:06:10.551 --> 00:06:11.240
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

240
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.140
<v Speaker 1>is respect for the primacy of individual consciousness.</v>

241
00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:18.290
<v Speaker 1>And what goes along with that primarily isn't individual rights,</v>

242
00:06:18.291 --> 00:06:19.670
<v Speaker 1>although that's built into it.</v>

243
00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:22.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the reason we have individual rights is for respect for that.</v>

244
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.660
<v Speaker 1>But the responsibility that comes along with being an individual instead of the</v>

245
00:06:26.661 --> 00:06:27.800
<v Speaker 1>member of some group,</v>

246
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.420
<v Speaker 1>especially a victimized group,</v>

247
00:06:29.421 --> 00:06:31.000
<v Speaker 1>which is like the usher.</v>

248
00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.790
<v Speaker 1>I wrote an article with one of my students who had toured the mass grave sites</v>

249
00:06:34.791 --> 00:06:36.770
<v Speaker 1>and in the former Yugoslavia,</v>

250
00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:36.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

251
00:06:36.981 --> 00:06:37.820
<v Speaker 1>and have been explored,</v>

252
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:39.140
<v Speaker 1>exposed to that sort of thing.</v>

253
00:06:39.141 --> 00:06:43.880
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that our research indicated was that the best predictor of</v>

254
00:06:43.881 --> 00:06:48.230
<v Speaker 1>genocide is a victimization on the part of the group that produces the genocide.</v>

255
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:48.501
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

256
00:06:48.501 --> 00:06:50.870
<v Speaker 1>A sense of an accelerated sense of victimization.</v>

257
00:06:50.871 --> 00:06:51.291
<v Speaker 1>And then it's,</v>

258
00:06:51.291 --> 00:06:53.120
<v Speaker 1>well we get them before they get us.</v>

259
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.260
<v Speaker 1>So when everyone's being taught now that they're a victim and then no one seems</v>

260
00:06:57.261 --> 00:06:58.310
<v Speaker 1>to have any sense that,</v>

261
00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:58.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

262
00:06:58.821 --> 00:07:03.260
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the essential tragedy of being that life is suffering and that</v>

263
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.520
<v Speaker 1>and that and that and that,</v>

264
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.030
<v Speaker 1>and that the world rests on a foundation of suffering.</v>

265
00:07:08.031 --> 00:07:12.140
<v Speaker 1>It's nothing to take personally and something to take responsibility for instead</v>

266
00:07:12.141 --> 00:07:13.330
<v Speaker 1>of blaming and,</v>

267
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.060
<v Speaker 1>and resentment and all of the things that have polluted our universities and our</v>

268
00:07:17.061 --> 00:07:17.510
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>
