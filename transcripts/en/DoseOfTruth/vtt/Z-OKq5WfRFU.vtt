1
00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:01.150
<v Speaker 1>Justice.</v>

2
00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:02.140
<v Speaker 1>That is a good one.</v>

3
00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:03.670
<v Speaker 1>Let's circle back to young people,</v>

4
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:04.840
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.050
<v Speaker 1>because the future is going to belong to them before we know it,</v>

6
00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:08.770
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

7
00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:09.603
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

8
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
<v Speaker 1>remarkable and a very insightful and engaging human being.</v>

9
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.700
<v Speaker 1>Jonathan Height is perhaps a,</v>

10
00:00:21.701 --> 00:00:26.170
<v Speaker 1>a leading example of somebody who's seen from a left perspective himself.</v>

11
00:00:26.171 --> 00:00:31.171
<v Speaker 1>How dangerous all of his ears on how we're endangering young people by not being</v>

12
00:00:32.981 --> 00:00:33.760
<v Speaker 1>honest with them,</v>

13
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.380
<v Speaker 1>not encouraging them to,</v>

14
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.910
<v Speaker 1>to explore what they instinctively feel needs to be explored going back to our</v>

15
00:00:39.911 --> 00:00:44.911
<v Speaker 1>earlier topic and when leaving them without the resilience that they're going to</v>

16
00:00:45.431 --> 00:00:50.431
<v Speaker 1>need to confirm if you like a free and prosperous society.</v>

17
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:52.481
<v Speaker 1>And A,</v>

18
00:00:52.481 --> 00:00:55.150
<v Speaker 1>I had a question he would run relating to this,</v>

19
00:00:55.151 --> 00:00:56.470
<v Speaker 1>which I'd just like to read,</v>

20
00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:57.663
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.450
<v Speaker 1>in his piece of the coddling of the American mind.</v>

22
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.480
<v Speaker 1>Jonathan Heit outlines why millennials today are so fragile and lacking</v>

23
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.820
<v Speaker 1>resilience in life and in relationships,</v>

24
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.070
<v Speaker 1>in university courses in the workplace,</v>

25
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.850
<v Speaker 1>and what has led to this overwhelming push to be protected from anything</v>

26
00:01:15.851 --> 00:01:18.250
<v Speaker 1>difficult or uncomfortable or offensive.</v>

27
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.160
<v Speaker 1>And he calls it the flight to safety.</v>

28
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.110
<v Speaker 1>And I think you've used that expression.</v>

29
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

30
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.750
<v Speaker 1>he outlines the core reason for this fragility of mind and emotion.</v>

31
00:01:28.751 --> 00:01:33.370
<v Speaker 1>He says it stems firstly from overfunctioning and over protective parents.</v>

32
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.600
<v Speaker 1>Then schools now reaches into our universities and of course more people than</v>

33
00:01:37.601 --> 00:01:37.811
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

34
00:01:37.811 --> 00:01:39.190
<v Speaker 1>I go to universities in the west,</v>

35
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.480
<v Speaker 1>so they formed a much bigger bulk in our community afterwards and at least some</v>

36
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.290
<v Speaker 1>tragically unprepared and unarmed for life and relationships.</v>

37
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.150
<v Speaker 1>Would you comment on,</v>

38
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.310
<v Speaker 1>I think it's good to take a step back from that and think about it in the</v>

39
00:01:54.311 --> 00:01:55.660
<v Speaker 1>broadest possible terms.</v>

40
00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.400
<v Speaker 1>There is definitely an epidemic of over protective parenting,</v>

41
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.700
<v Speaker 1>but it's useful to ask why.</v>

42
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.440
<v Speaker 1>And my suspicions are,</v>

43
00:02:05.441 --> 00:02:10.441
<v Speaker 1>is that this is driven by very fundamental biological and cultural phenomena</v>

44
00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.440
<v Speaker 1>that aren't generally considered in relationship to this issue.</v>

45
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.880
<v Speaker 2>We don't have very many children.</v>

46
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.823
<v Speaker 2>We don't have</v>

47
00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.200
<v Speaker 1>12 you know,</v>

48
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.710
<v Speaker 1>six of whom died.</v>

49
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.220
<v Speaker 2>We have one or two</v>

50
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.510
<v Speaker 1>that makes them very precious,</v>

51
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

52
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.080
<v Speaker 1>We're unwilling to take risks with them and no wonder.</v>

53
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.620
<v Speaker 1>And then we also have the much later in life.</v>

54
00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.940
<v Speaker 1>And so like if you have a kid when you're 18 you're still a kid.</v>

55
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.000
<v Speaker 1>You know you're going to go out and have your life,</v>

56
00:02:44.001 --> 00:02:44.271
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

57
00:02:44.271 --> 00:02:46.670
<v Speaker 1>Because you're so while you were in the,</v>

58
00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.830
<v Speaker 1>in the height of your exploratory,</v>

59
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.061
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

60
00:02:50.061 --> 00:02:52.730
<v Speaker 1>you're in the height of the exploratory part of your life.</v>

61
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.350
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to overprotect your kid because you're still a kid.</v>

62
00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.250
<v Speaker 1>But if you're 40 and have one child,</v>

63
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.070
<v Speaker 3>it's like all your eggs are in one basket.</v>

64
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.120
<v Speaker 3>And the probability that you're going to take undue risks with that precious</v>

65
00:03:07.121 --> 00:03:08.680
<v Speaker 3>person is very,</v>

66
00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:09.161
<v Speaker 3>very low.</v>

67
00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:12.070
<v Speaker 3>Now obviously there's some advantages to that because great,</v>

68
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.750
<v Speaker 3>you would devote resources to your child,</v>

69
00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:14.021
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

70
00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:15.490
<v Speaker 3>and foster their development.</v>

71
00:03:15.491 --> 00:03:20.491
<v Speaker 3>But the downside is that you have every motivation to hover and maybe you're</v>

72
00:03:21.161 --> 00:03:26.161
<v Speaker 3>also extraordinarily desperate as a mother to maintain that bond with your child</v>

73
00:03:27.641 --> 00:03:30.400
<v Speaker 3>because you've struggled so long to achieve it.</v>

74
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.091
<v Speaker 3>It's a highly,</v>

75
00:03:31.091 --> 00:03:31.990
<v Speaker 3>highly valuable,</v>

76
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.340
<v Speaker 3>you can't take a risk.</v>

77
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.271
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

78
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:35.560
<v Speaker 3>so these,</v>

79
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:36.730
<v Speaker 3>so we might say,</v>

80
00:03:36.731 --> 00:03:37.060
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

81
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.840
<v Speaker 3>perhaps over protective parenting is a secondary unintended consequence of the</v>

82
00:03:40.841 --> 00:03:41.740
<v Speaker 3>birth control pill.</v>

83
00:03:41.741 --> 00:03:45.490
<v Speaker 3>And the fact that people now have children later in life could easily be,</v>

84
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:46.031
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

85
00:03:46.031 --> 00:03:46.960
<v Speaker 3>if you have six kids,</v>

86
00:03:46.961 --> 00:03:47.201
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

87
00:03:47.201 --> 00:03:47.651
<v Speaker 3>what are you going to do?</v>

88
00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:48.820
<v Speaker 3>Hype helicopter,</v>

89
00:03:48.821 --> 00:03:49.720
<v Speaker 3>parent them.</v>

90
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:50.171
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

91
00:03:50.171 --> 00:03:50.950
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

92
00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:51.790
<v Speaker 3>you're so tired.</v>

93
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.140
<v Speaker 3>You can't even get off the couch.</v>

94
00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.030
<v Speaker 3>If you have six kids and they're,</v>

95
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.140
<v Speaker 3>they outnumber you,</v>

96
00:03:56.141 --> 00:03:56.351
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

97
00:03:56.351 --> 00:03:57.610
<v Speaker 3>They're raising each other.</v>

98
00:03:57.611 --> 00:04:00.220
<v Speaker 3>They're competing and they're taking each other down a peg.</v>

99
00:04:00.221 --> 00:04:00.581
<v Speaker 3>They're not,</v>

100
00:04:00.581 --> 00:04:01.990
<v Speaker 3>there's no overprotection there,</v>

101
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:03.550
<v Speaker 3>but with the,</v>

102
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.880
<v Speaker 3>with a single child landscape or dual child landscape,</v>

103
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.460
<v Speaker 3>mostly a single child landscape,</v>

104
00:04:09.461 --> 00:04:14.170
<v Speaker 3>then you're going to overprotect and then that ethos starts to permeate the</v>

105
00:04:14.171 --> 00:04:18.430
<v Speaker 3>schools and it starts to permeate the higher education institutions as those</v>

106
00:04:18.431 --> 00:04:19.330
<v Speaker 3>children mature,</v>

107
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.790
<v Speaker 3>and then that all reinforces it.</v>

108
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.923
<v Speaker 3>Not Good.</v>

109
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.990
<v Speaker 3>It's not obvious what to do about it either because if it is driven by</v>

110
00:04:25.991 --> 00:04:27.010
<v Speaker 3>demographics in that,</v>

111
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.873
<v Speaker 3>in that sense,</v>

112
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.890
<v Speaker 3>it's a much more intractable problem that we think.</v>

113
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.280
<v Speaker 3>So I did some of that in 12 rules for life,</v>

114
00:04:33.281 --> 00:04:33.461
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

115
00:04:33.461 --> 00:04:33.761
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

116
00:04:33.761 --> 00:04:34.260
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

117
00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.660
<v Speaker 3>what you have to understand is that you're a danger to your children no matter</v>

118
00:04:37.661 --> 00:04:38.494
<v Speaker 3>what.</v>

119
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:39.550
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

120
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.550
<v Speaker 3>You can let them go out in the world and be hurt or you can overprotect them and</v>

121
00:04:44.891 --> 00:04:46.030
<v Speaker 3>hurt them that way.</v>

122
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.660
<v Speaker 3>So you,</v>

123
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:47.560
<v Speaker 3>here's your choice.</v>

124
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:52.720
<v Speaker 3>You can make your children competent and courageous or you can make them safe,</v>

125
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.750
<v Speaker 3>but you can't make them safe because life isn't safe.</v>

126
00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.950
<v Speaker 3>So if you sacrifice their courage and competence on the altar of safety,</v>

127
00:04:59.951 --> 00:05:04.120
<v Speaker 3>then you disarm them completely and all they can do is pray to be protected.</v>

128
00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.950
<v Speaker 3>So in the very act of trying to do the right thing by them,</v>

129
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.330
<v Speaker 3>although often with a selfish motive right off of the surface mining,</v>

130
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:14.793
<v Speaker 3>we</v>

131
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:21.030
<v Speaker 3>strip why the tools and the equipment and the understanding they really need to</v>

132
00:05:22.001 --> 00:05:22.900
<v Speaker 3>make life work.</v>

133
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.381
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

134
00:05:23.381 --> 00:05:23.801
<v Speaker 3>that's the,</v>

135
00:05:23.801 --> 00:05:24.790
<v Speaker 3>that's the DePaul mother,</v>

136
00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:24.971
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

137
00:05:24.971 --> 00:05:28.990
<v Speaker 3>That was for great discovery of the dark mother and the dark mother is the</v>

138
00:05:28.991 --> 00:05:29.440
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>

139
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.890
<v Speaker 3>She's the witch in Hansel and Gretel gingerbread house.</v>

140
00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.520
<v Speaker 3>Lost children too good to be true.</v>

141
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.410
<v Speaker 3>It's like a house of candy.</v>

142
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.070
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

143
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.360
<v Speaker 3>Who could want anything better?</v>

144
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.670
<v Speaker 3>What lives inside the House of Candy,</v>

145
00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.240
<v Speaker 3>the which that wants to fatten you up and eat you.</v>

146
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:47.680
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

147
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.070
<v Speaker 3>A cautionary tale about over protective parents,</v>

148
00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:52.690
<v Speaker 3>over protective mothers,</v>

149
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.670
<v Speaker 3>about the over protective feminine.</v>

150
00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:56.350
<v Speaker 3>It's like the psychoanalysts,</v>

151
00:05:56.351 --> 00:05:57.860
<v Speaker 3>they were so said,</v>

152
00:05:57.861 --> 00:06:01.730
<v Speaker 3>the good mother necessarily fails at such a brilliant phrase.</v>

153
00:06:01.731 --> 00:06:03.230
<v Speaker 3>It's like you can't,</v>

154
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.843
<v Speaker 3>as you,</v>

155
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.700
<v Speaker 3>as your child matures,</v>

156
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:09.920
<v Speaker 3>you have to fail more and more as a mother.</v>

157
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:10.161
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

158
00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:14.540
<v Speaker 3>Until by the time you're 30 you're your child's 30 let's say 25 for that matter,</v>

159
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.570
<v Speaker 3>you're not their mother anymore.</v>

160
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously you are,</v>

161
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.430
<v Speaker 3>but the relationship has hit something like quasi peer status,</v>

162
00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:23.810
<v Speaker 3>not entirely obviously,</v>

163
00:06:23.811 --> 00:06:25.280
<v Speaker 3>but the child is independent,</v>

164
00:06:25.281 --> 00:06:27.890
<v Speaker 3>able to stand up on their own two feet and take on the world.</v>

165
00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.321
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

166
00:06:28.321 --> 00:06:31.650
<v Speaker 1>now we say this thing or the university student runs into some difficulties with</v>

167
00:06:31.651 --> 00:06:34.770
<v Speaker 1>study or whatever and it brings the parents in to talk to the faculty.</v>

168
00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:35.261
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

169
00:06:35.261 --> 00:06:36.400
<v Speaker 3>Or they go off in color.</v>

170
00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:42.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean when I went to Queens University a week ago and there was a lot of noise</v>

171
00:06:42.581 --> 00:06:44.150
<v Speaker 3>and and horror around that,</v>

172
00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.220
<v Speaker 3>you know that the people who were decrying my visit set up coloring book</v>

173
00:06:48.221 --> 00:06:52.120
<v Speaker 3>stations so that people could be comforted because you know the evil professor</v>

174
00:06:52.121 --> 00:06:53.140
<v Speaker 3>was coming to talk.</v>

175
00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:53.950
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

176
00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:57.850
<v Speaker 3>and you know as a clinician and height knows this as well and all the clinicians</v>

177
00:06:57.851 --> 00:06:58.481
<v Speaker 3>worth their salt.</v>

178
00:06:58.481 --> 00:06:58.651
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

179
00:06:58.651 --> 00:07:03.651
<v Speaker 3>this the worst thing you can do for someone who's anxious is overprotect them.</v>

180
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:06.520
<v Speaker 3>It makes them worse.</v>

181
00:07:06.521 --> 00:07:08.890
<v Speaker 3>The clinical literature on that is crystal clear.</v>

182
00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:14.010
<v Speaker 3>What you do for people who are hyper anxious is gradually expose them with their</v>

183
00:07:14.231 --> 00:07:19.231
<v Speaker 3>voluntary consent to increasingly threatening situations that cures them.</v>

184
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.200
<v Speaker 3>It's exactly the opposite of what all the mental health professionals so,</v>

185
00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:28.240
<v Speaker 3>and I use that term extraordinarily lightly or trying to do to produce safe</v>

186
00:07:28.241 --> 00:07:30.070
<v Speaker 3>spaces on the university campus.</v>

187
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:35.410
<v Speaker 3>Like if a safe as if it's space needs to be defined as safe.</v>

188
00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:37.330
<v Speaker 3>You can be sure that's the one thing.</v>

189
00:07:37.331 --> 00:07:38.164
<v Speaker 3>It is not</v>

190
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.420
<v Speaker 1>drove and this has been fascinating.</v>

191
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:43.400
<v Speaker 1>Let me pay you a compliment.</v>

192
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:44.241
<v Speaker 1>In some ways,</v>

193
00:07:44.241 --> 00:07:49.241
<v Speaker 1>I think the most valuable thing you can do for us is to model the courage to</v>

194
00:07:49.641 --> 00:07:50.570
<v Speaker 1>speak your mind.</v>

195
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:52.430
<v Speaker 1>You do it forcefully,</v>

196
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:54.140
<v Speaker 1>you do it courageously,</v>

197
00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:59.300
<v Speaker 1>you do it compassionately because the reality is you only have to spend a bit of</v>

198
00:07:59.301 --> 00:08:02.450
<v Speaker 1>time with you to realize that you actually care,</v>

199
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:05.840
<v Speaker 1>especially about our young people and what they're experiencing.</v>

200
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:11.350
<v Speaker 1>And especially for our young men because we know boys model themselves are men</v>

201
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:15.440
<v Speaker 1>who they respect</v>

202
00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:17.241
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

203
00:08:17.241 --> 00:08:19.950
<v Speaker 1>They are great job of modeling courage in the face of it.</v>

204
00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:20.531
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

205
00:08:20.531 --> 00:08:23.890
<v Speaker 3>there's something I like to say maybe in closing about courage.</v>

206
00:08:23.891 --> 00:08:25.490
<v Speaker 3>People say that to me and you know,</v>

207
00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's exactly right.</v>

208
00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:28.320
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>

209
00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.680
<v Speaker 3>there's a line in the Old Testament,</v>

210
00:08:29.681 --> 00:08:33.160
<v Speaker 3>the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom and I think it's more like that.</v>

211
00:08:33.161 --> 00:08:34.540
<v Speaker 3>It's not that I'm courageous,</v>

212
00:08:34.541 --> 00:08:36.430
<v Speaker 3>it's that I'm afraid of the right things.</v>

213
00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.120
<v Speaker 3>So when I made my videos,</v>

214
00:08:39.121 --> 00:08:40.990
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't like that didn't make me nervous,</v>

215
00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:46.390
<v Speaker 3>but I was less nervous about going back to bed and not saying what I had to say,</v>

216
00:08:46.391 --> 00:08:49.600
<v Speaker 3>that I was about making the videos because I know where this is going.</v>

217
00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:51.550
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to go there.</v>

218
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:53.160
<v Speaker 3>And so it's,</v>

219
00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:54.940
<v Speaker 3>it's not so much courage.</v>

220
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.280
<v Speaker 3>It's that it's a matter of,</v>

221
00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:57.410
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

222
00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:57.800
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

223
00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:58.290
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

224
00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:03.290
<v Speaker 3>it's less risky to say something than to remain silent when,</v>

225
00:09:04.291 --> 00:09:04.621
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

226
00:09:04.621 --> 00:09:05.760
<v Speaker 3>there's something to be said.</v>

227
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:07.650
<v Speaker 3>I know that to be the case.</v>

228
00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:12.180
<v Speaker 3>And so lots of times in life it's like there's no pathway forward that's going</v>

229
00:09:12.181 --> 00:09:13.260
<v Speaker 3>to shield you from risk.</v>

230
00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:15.990
<v Speaker 3>You get to pick this risk or you get to pick this risk.</v>

231
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:19.440
<v Speaker 3>And I think I picked the lesser risk and that might be wise,</v>

232
00:09:19.441 --> 00:09:21.180
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not so sure it's courageous.</v>

233
00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:22.373
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

234
00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:23.910
<v Speaker 3>I think it's admirable.</v>

235
00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:25.140
<v Speaker 3>Let's leave it on that basis.</v>

236
00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:25.740
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

237
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:26.573
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

238
00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.100
<v Speaker 3>Thank you very much for the conversation.</v>
