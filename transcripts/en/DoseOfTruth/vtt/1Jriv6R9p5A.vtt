<v Speaker 1>working class language,</v>

3
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.340
<v Speaker 1>working class,</v>

<v Speaker 1>contorted jargon of this udall leftist</v>
<v Speaker 1>of academe who are fraud.</v>

7
00:00:24.301 --> 00:00:27.030
<v Speaker 1>These people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people who managed to manage to</v>

8
00:00:27.031 --> 00:00:30.450
<v Speaker 1>rise to the top and at Berkeley and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harvard and Princeton.</v>

9
00:00:30.451 --> 00:00:31.650
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any of these people are</v>

10
00:00:31.651 --> 00:00:33.510
<v Speaker 1>radical?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are career people.</v>

11
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.130
<v Speaker 1>Their corporate types.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

12
00:00:35.131 --> 00:00:38.670
<v Speaker 1>Then who like who succeeded in it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They love the institutional contacts.</v>

13
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.890
<v Speaker 1>They know how to manipulate the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bureaucracy,</v>

14
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.110
<v Speaker 1>which is totally invaded in usurped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

15
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.350
<v Speaker 1>The academe everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

16
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.590
<v Speaker 1>These people are company polit players.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could have done well in any,</v>

17
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.690
<v Speaker 1>any field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They love to sit in endless committees.</v>

18
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.090
<v Speaker 1>They loved bureaucratic regulation and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so on.</v>

19
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.970
<v Speaker 1>There's not one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not one leftist.</v>

20
00:00:56.971 --> 00:00:59.520
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And American academe raised his or her</v>

21
00:00:59.521 --> 00:01:01.960
<v Speaker 1>voice against obscene growth.</v>

22
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.880
<v Speaker 1>Growth tuition costs which have</v>
<v Speaker 1>bankrupted a whole generation of young</v>

23
00:01:05.881 --> 00:01:06.660
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>

24
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.100
<v Speaker 1>not one voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

25
00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:11.400
<v Speaker 1>To challenge that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That that invasion by the bureaucrats.</v>

26
00:01:11.401 --> 00:01:14.040
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actual fascist bureaucrats.</v>

27
00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:14.570
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

28
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.800
<v Speaker 1>if we added the cancer risks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

29
00:01:16.801 --> 00:01:20.820
<v Speaker 1>There are so many of them because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>faculty have completely lost any power</v>

30
00:01:20.821 --> 00:01:22.100
<v Speaker 1>in American academia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

31
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.790
<v Speaker 1>It's us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a scandal.</v>

32
00:01:23.791 --> 00:01:24.570
<v Speaker 1>What has happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

33
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.540
<v Speaker 1>And they deserve the president's</v>
<v Speaker 1>servitude that they're in right now.</v>

34
00:01:27.541 --> 00:01:28.860
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they never protested.</v>

35
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.590
<v Speaker 1>When I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>my first job at Bennington College,</v>

36
00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:32.550
<v Speaker 1>Ninety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>76.</v>

37
00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:36.300
<v Speaker 1>I was there when there was an uprising</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the faculty against encroachment,</v>

38
00:01:36.301 --> 00:01:38.190
<v Speaker 1>by the board of trustees and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>

39
00:01:38.191 --> 00:01:39.870
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was a huge thing.</v>

40
00:01:39.871 --> 00:01:40.441
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

41
00:01:40.441 --> 00:01:42.330
<v Speaker 1>It was reported on the New York Times</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so on.</v>

42
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.380
<v Speaker 1>And we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we pushed that precedent out.</v>

43
00:01:44.381 --> 00:01:45.090
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

44
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.940
<v Speaker 1>and there's not been a single uprising</v>
<v Speaker 1>of mankind against,</v>

45
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.250
<v Speaker 1>against encroachment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the trustees and by the</v>

46
00:01:50.251 --> 00:01:52.490
<v Speaker 1>administrations and all these decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

47
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.720
<v Speaker 1>Pass them slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slaves.</v>

48
00:01:54.721 --> 00:01:56.040
<v Speaker 1>They deserve their slavery.</v>

49
00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.760
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't agree more.</v>

50
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.630
<v Speaker 2>I thought the same thing about</v>
<v Speaker 2>university professors for a long time is</v>

51
00:02:02.631 --> 00:02:06.530
<v Speaker 2>that they get exactly what they deserve</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they never stand up and say no.</v>

52
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.610
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not quite as bad in Canada,</v>

53
00:02:10.611 --> 00:02:14.090
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that the students have been</v>

54
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.990
<v Speaker 2>essentially handed a bill of indentured</v>
<v Speaker 2>servitude here for the student loans is</v>

55
00:02:17.991 --> 00:02:20.060
<v Speaker 2>absolutely beyond comprehension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

56
00:02:20.061 --> 00:02:24.560
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me that the bureaucracy has</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically conspired to determine how to</v>

57
00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:27.890
<v Speaker 2>pick the pockets of the students' future</v>
<v Speaker 2>earnings.</v>

58
00:02:27.891 --> 00:02:30.110
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they do that by offering them an</v>

59
00:02:30.111 --> 00:02:32.960
<v Speaker 2>extended adolescence with no quality</v>
<v Speaker 2>control,</v>

60
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.690
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a real bargain with the devil.</v>

61
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.010
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I told the abandonment of any kind</v>

62
00:02:38.011 --> 00:02:40.410
<v Speaker 1>of education actually in history and</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

63
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.120
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody got along with it.</v>

64
00:02:42.121 --> 00:02:46.170
<v Speaker 1>That is the transformation into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cafeteria kind of a menu.</v>

65
00:02:46.171 --> 00:02:47.970
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can pick this course or that course</v>

66
00:02:47.971 --> 00:02:50.940
<v Speaker 1>or this course without any kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>guidance from the university about a</v>

67
00:02:50.941 --> 00:02:55.470
<v Speaker 1>central core curriculum that teaches you</v>
<v Speaker 1>history and chronology and introduces</v>

68
00:02:55.471 --> 00:02:56.580
<v Speaker 1>you to the basics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

69
00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 1>Because what are our professors are</v>
<v Speaker 1>prima donnas.</v>

70
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.500
<v Speaker 1>They can only teach and their little</v>
<v Speaker 1>areas.</v>

71
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.950
<v Speaker 1>So we have this total fragmentation and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the the,</v>

72
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.190
<v Speaker 1>the great art history survey courses are</v>
<v Speaker 1>being abandoned steadily because why?</v>

73
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.730
<v Speaker 1>Because graduate students are not</v>
<v Speaker 1>trained to see the great narratives or</v>

74
00:03:12.731 --> 00:03:15.250
<v Speaker 1>the network because we are taught now</v>
<v Speaker 1>that narratives are fault.</v>
