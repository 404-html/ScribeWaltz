1
00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:12.150
<v Speaker 1>Idea of individual responsibility</v>
<v Speaker 1>through through 12 rules,</v>

2
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.440
<v Speaker 1>while we might say we might begin by</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about how that's related to the</v>

3
00:00:18.461 --> 00:00:20.770
<v Speaker 1>idea of free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like</v>

4
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.340
<v Speaker 1>you have to find your way in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say with all of your</v>

5
00:00:27.341 --> 00:00:30.670
<v Speaker 1>peculiarities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your idiosyncrasies and your differences</v>

6
00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.090
<v Speaker 1>and the way you do that is by acting in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

7
00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.510
<v Speaker 1>but the way you prepare to act is by</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking and really what you're doing</v>

8
00:00:39.761 --> 00:00:42.970
<v Speaker 1>when you're thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a philosopher named Alfred North</v>

9
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.100
<v Speaker 1>Whitehead who said something very</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent about thinking.</v>

10
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.180
<v Speaker 1>He said that the reason we think is so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that our thoughts can die instead of us.</v>

11
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.210
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a Darwinian idea.</v>

12
00:00:52.211 --> 00:00:57.211
<v Speaker 1>So the way animals adapt to the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>across time is that animals produced</v>

13
00:00:57.821 --> 00:01:01.240
<v Speaker 1>variance very into offspring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of them,</v>

14
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.120
<v Speaker 1>and most of them were unsuccessful and</v>
<v Speaker 1>die,</v>

15
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.780
<v Speaker 1>but a few of them are successful enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that time and place to reproduce.</v>

16
00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.030
<v Speaker 1>And so the animal keeps living across</v>
<v Speaker 1>the millennia varying slightly as it</v>

17
00:01:16.061 --> 00:01:18.580
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to adapt to the transformations of</v>

18
00:01:18.581 --> 00:01:21.580
<v Speaker 1>the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Human beings do the same thing,</v>

19
00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:25.450
<v Speaker 1>but we also have figured out how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>abstract that and so what we do when we</v>

20
00:01:25.451 --> 00:01:30.451
<v Speaker 1>think is that we produce a fictional</v>
<v Speaker 1>world that's a simulation of the real</v>

21
00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:36.391
<v Speaker 1>world and we populate that simulated</v>
<v Speaker 1>world with simulations of us and then we</v>

22
00:01:37.031 --> 00:01:40.960
<v Speaker 1>let those simulations play out in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>simulated world and the ones that are</v>

23
00:01:40.961 --> 00:01:44.140
<v Speaker 1>successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we embody and act out and the ones that</v>

24
00:01:44.141 --> 00:01:48.130
<v Speaker 1>are unsuccessful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We abandoned and let die and we do that.</v>

25
00:01:48.131 --> 00:01:53.131
<v Speaker 1>When we're thinking in dreams and we do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that when we think in stories and we</v>

26
00:01:53.741 --> 00:01:57.730
<v Speaker 1>even do that when we think in words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although it's not as obvious when you</v>

27
00:01:57.731 --> 00:02:00.760
<v Speaker 1>argue internally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what you do when you think you</v>

28
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.780
<v Speaker 1>have an Avatar that manifests itself as</v>
<v Speaker 1>one point of view and an Avatar that</v>

29
00:02:04.781 --> 00:02:09.781
<v Speaker 1>manifests itself as another and you let</v>
<v Speaker 1>them engage in conflict and the one that</v>

30
00:02:10.211 --> 00:02:11.800
<v Speaker 1>loses you let go off.</v>

31
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.400
<v Speaker 1>That's a sacrifice and if you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussing something with someone and</v>

32
00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:19.660
<v Speaker 1>it's important that you both put your</v>
<v Speaker 1>viewpoints forward and you analyze the</v>

33
00:02:19.661 --> 00:02:23.500
<v Speaker 1>consequences of the dispute and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>walk away with any luck,</v>

34
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.940
<v Speaker 1>why is there then you were so that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can embody a motive being that's more</v>

35
00:02:27.941 --> 00:02:32.941
<v Speaker 1>likely to be successful and you do that</v>
<v Speaker 1>in part in large part by exercising your</v>

36
00:02:33.221 --> 00:02:35.860
<v Speaker 1>freedom of speech and you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

37
00:02:35.861 --> 00:02:37.930
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freedom of speech and freedom of</v>

38
00:02:37.931 --> 00:02:40.390
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the answer to that is don't be</v>

39
00:02:40.391 --> 00:02:45.391
<v Speaker 1>thinking that you think because thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>is very hard and most people can't think</v>

40
00:02:46.781 --> 00:02:50.290
<v Speaker 1>at all and even if you can think you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not very good at it.</v>

41
00:02:50.291 --> 00:02:53.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean think about what you have to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>technically to think.</v>

42
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.380
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to formulate the problem that's</v>

43
00:02:56.381 --> 00:02:58.480
<v Speaker 1>hard enough and you have to formulate it</v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely.</v>

44
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.760
<v Speaker 1>Then have to generate multiple potential</v>
<v Speaker 1>solutions to the problem and then you</v>

45
00:03:03.761 --> 00:03:08.761
<v Speaker 1>have to let those solutions argue</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves into a hierarchy internally</v>

46
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.090
<v Speaker 1>and so you have to be able to tolerate</v>
<v Speaker 1>that stress,</v>

47
00:03:13.091 --> 00:03:14.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just be one thing if you're</v>

48
00:03:14.741 --> 00:03:16.990
<v Speaker 1>going to think because thinking isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>just saying that.</v>

49
00:03:16.991 --> 00:03:19.780
<v Speaker 1>What I think is right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not thinking at all.</v>

50
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.380
<v Speaker 1>Thinking is questioning whether or not</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you think is right is right and</v>

51
00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:27.160
<v Speaker 1>that's really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very demanding and so and you can</v>

52
00:03:27.161 --> 00:03:29.440
<v Speaker 1>do that to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not as good at it as you</v>

53
00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:31.150
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you're a pretty good thinker.</v>

54
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.390
<v Speaker 1>Mostly the way you think is by talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you talk and mostly when you talk</v>

55
00:03:37.241 --> 00:03:41.980
<v Speaker 1>and think it's contentious as you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've ever had an intimate</v>

56
00:03:41.981 --> 00:03:45.940
<v Speaker 1>relationship with someone because an</v>
<v Speaker 1>intimate relationship,</v>

57
00:03:45.941 --> 00:03:47.740
<v Speaker 1>if it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it has any worth at all,</v>

58
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.630
<v Speaker 1>is a place where there's tremendous</v>
<v Speaker 1>contention but it's bounded within</v>

59
00:03:52.631 --> 00:03:56.860
<v Speaker 1>something approximating mutual respect</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the willingness to continue to play</v>

60
00:03:56.861 --> 00:04:01.010
<v Speaker 1>the game across time and the reason that</v>
<v Speaker 1>an intimate relationship is contentious</v>

61
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.090
<v Speaker 1>because life is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult and people are different</v>

62
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.450
<v Speaker 1>and we face extraordinarily complex</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems together.</v>

63
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.400
<v Speaker 1>Like how to make a living and how to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How to operate properly in our careers</v>

64
00:04:12.401 --> 00:04:15.190
<v Speaker 1>and how to rank order the importance of</v>
<v Speaker 1>our careers and how to manage our</v>

65
00:04:15.191 --> 00:04:19.360
<v Speaker 1>domestic economies and how to discipline</v>
<v Speaker 1>our kids and whether or not to have kids</v>

66
00:04:19.361 --> 00:04:24.361
<v Speaker 1>and how to enter middle age and how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>grow old gracefully and how to live</v>

67
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.390
<v Speaker 1>productively and where to vacation and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of these things which are</v>

68
00:04:28.391 --> 00:04:31.750
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily difficult problems and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only way that we can solve them is</v>

69
00:04:31.751 --> 00:04:36.250
<v Speaker 1>by butting heads to some degree and</v>
<v Speaker 1>communicating freely about what the</v>

70
00:04:36.251 --> 00:04:41.020
<v Speaker 1>possibilities are and negotiating a</v>
<v Speaker 1>solution and that's thinking and in</v>

71
00:04:41.021 --> 00:04:44.560
<v Speaker 1>order to do that thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be able to speak freely and</v>

72
00:04:44.561 --> 00:04:47.950
<v Speaker 1>you certainly have to be willing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>offend someone.</v>

73
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all the stupid questions I've ever</v>

74
00:04:50.141 --> 00:04:53.050
<v Speaker 1>been asked by journalists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question,</v>

75
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.850
<v Speaker 1>what makes you think you have the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>to offend someone by what you say is by</v>

76
00:04:57.851 --> 00:05:02.851
<v Speaker 1>far the most miraculously ignorant and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>say that because,</v>

77
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.253
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

78
00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:08.640
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just.</v>

79
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.450
<v Speaker 1>It just sets me back on my heels to some</v>
<v Speaker 1>degree because I think,</v>

80
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.540
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's your claim here?</v>

81
00:05:15.541 --> 00:05:20.541
<v Speaker 1>Your claim is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your first claim is we could</v>

82
00:05:21.541 --> 00:05:24.510
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically discussed something</v>
<v Speaker 1>important without one of us getting</v>

83
00:05:24.511 --> 00:05:26.350
<v Speaker 1>upset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

84
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.330
<v Speaker 1>that's not gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you ever discuss anything important</v>

85
00:05:30.331 --> 00:05:33.780
<v Speaker 1>with anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including just discussing it with</v>

86
00:05:33.781 --> 00:05:37.080
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only are you going to get upset,</v>

87
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.530
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get so upset that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably won't even do it.</v>

88
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.731
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

89
00:05:41.731 --> 00:05:43.110
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a difficult problem.</v>

90
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.360
<v Speaker 1>What do you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's your first reaction?</v>

91
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to sit right here and think</v>

92
00:05:47.431 --> 00:05:48.420
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

93
00:05:48.421 --> 00:05:49.620
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that isn't your reaction.</v>

94
00:05:49.621 --> 00:05:53.640
<v Speaker 1>Your reaction is to go like play a video</v>
<v Speaker 1>game or watch a youtube video or or</v>

95
00:05:53.641 --> 00:05:58.641
<v Speaker 1>vacuum your bedroom or do the dishes or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever can do not to think about that.</v>

96
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.290
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

97
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.270
<v Speaker 1>and then if you're going to have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion with your wife or your</v>

98
00:06:05.271 --> 00:06:08.030
<v Speaker 1>husband or your kids and it's about</v>
<v Speaker 1>something important.</v>

99
00:06:08.031 --> 00:06:12.770
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you're a normal person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your heart rate goes up and it's like</v>

100
00:06:12.771 --> 00:06:15.200
<v Speaker 1>it's demanding and then you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>think it through and then you're</v>

101
00:06:15.201 --> 00:06:18.380
<v Speaker 1>probably wrong and you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>stumble over your words and God only</v>

102
00:06:18.381 --> 00:06:20.870
<v Speaker 1>knows if you're going to reach a</v>
<v Speaker 1>solution and you can't tell if it's</v>

103
00:06:20.871 --> 00:06:25.190
<v Speaker 1>going to mean the end of your damn</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship and like the catastrophe</v>

104
00:06:25.191 --> 00:06:28.490
<v Speaker 1>lurks everywhere when you're discussing</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult issues and the rule is</v>

105
00:06:28.491 --> 00:06:31.160
<v Speaker 1>something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't offend anyone.</v>

106
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:32.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then okay,</v>

107
00:06:32.481 --> 00:06:33.830
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you never get to talk about</v>

108
00:06:33.831 --> 00:06:36.680
<v Speaker 1>anything that's important with anyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever including yourself.</v>

109
00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.320
<v Speaker 1>So like that's supposed to be the rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you think,</v>

110
00:06:39.321 --> 00:06:42.350
<v Speaker 1>well even if it's not quite that bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like let's say,</v>

111
00:06:42.351 --> 00:06:45.980
<v Speaker 1>so here I'm addressing about 850 people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

112
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the probability that I could talk</v>

113
00:06:49.131 --> 00:06:52.700
<v Speaker 1>about anything that any of you would</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever want to listen to for more than</v>

114
00:06:52.701 --> 00:06:54.540
<v Speaker 1>about 15 seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

115
00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.820
<v Speaker 1>that would grip your interest without me</v>
<v Speaker 1>or offending at least one person in this</v>

116
00:06:58.821 --> 00:07:02.390
<v Speaker 1>room with each sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a thousand people in here,</v>

117
00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some people are unbelievably easy to</v>

118
00:07:05.751 --> 00:07:06.980
<v Speaker 1>offend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's that.</v>

119
00:07:06.981 --> 00:07:09.230
<v Speaker 1>They're just looking for a reason to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>offended,</v>

120
00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.150
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's that problem.</v>

121
00:07:11.151 --> 00:07:13.610
<v Speaker 1>But if we're going to deal with things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are,</v>

122
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:18.670
<v Speaker 1>that are solid and contentious and why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about things that we already all</v>

123
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.440
<v Speaker 1>agree on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've already solved those problems.</v>

124
00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:24.290
<v Speaker 1>We can only really talk about things we</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't agree on.</v>

125
00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:26.780
<v Speaker 1>It's the only thing worth talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

126
00:07:26.781 --> 00:07:28.580
<v Speaker 1>of course everyone's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>offended.</v>

127
00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.790
<v Speaker 1>And so for a journalist to ask that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

128
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:33.860
<v Speaker 1>what the Hell's with you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

129
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.930
<v Speaker 1>What planet do you inhabit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you understand that your entire</v>

130
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:43.990
<v Speaker 1>discipline is predicated on not only</v>
<v Speaker 1>your right to offend someone,</v>

131
00:07:44.991 --> 00:07:48.890
<v Speaker 1>but the responsibility that you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>offend people.</v>

132
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.220
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's it's</v>

133
00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:11.720
<v Speaker 1>cool thinking isn't offensive act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why tyrants hated,</v>

134
00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:14.880
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because one of the rules and tyranny is</v>

135
00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:20.310
<v Speaker 1>don't think why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I already know all the answers</v>

136
00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:25.920
<v Speaker 1>and you're supposed to accept my answers</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the tyrant and so there's no need for</v>

137
00:08:25.921 --> 00:08:28.230
<v Speaker 1>your thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might be saying,</v>

138
00:08:28.231 --> 00:08:30.330
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my life isn't going as well as it could,</v>

139
00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:32.820
<v Speaker 1>and the tyrant says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

140
00:08:32.821 --> 00:08:36.480
<v Speaker 1>you don't get to think that because in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my utopian tyranny,</v>

141
00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:39.660
<v Speaker 1>everything's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're suffering,</v>

142
00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:44.550
<v Speaker 1>that means you're politically suspect</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're suffering.</v>

143
00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:48.540
<v Speaker 1>Your inability to recognize that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>utopia has already manifested itself.</v>

144
00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:51.210
<v Speaker 1>Your unhappiness is actually a political</v>
<v Speaker 1>crime,</v>

145
00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:54.510
<v Speaker 1>but if you just keep it to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we'll let you keep your head,</v>

146
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:59.900
<v Speaker 1>but you have the the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're driven to the extreme where</v>

147
00:09:00.181 --> 00:09:03.810
<v Speaker 1>you have to express the fact that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>unhappy,</v>

148
00:09:03.811 --> 00:09:06.090
<v Speaker 1>perhaps that your child doesn't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to eat,</v>

149
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:11.360
<v Speaker 1>then it's off to the Gulag with you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all your family as well because there'll</v>

150
00:09:11.461 --> 00:09:13.890
<v Speaker 1>be no thinking here and even if there</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

151
00:09:13.891 --> 00:09:15.540
<v Speaker 1>they'll certainly be no talking.</v>

152
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:19.470
<v Speaker 1>Here's something that happened recently</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Venezuela,</v>

153
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:25.070
<v Speaker 1>Mrs. Worth Thinking about for all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who harbor collectivist Utopian</v>

154
00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:28.260
<v Speaker 1>Dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela,</v>

155
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:31.170
<v Speaker 1>the Venezuelan government about two</v>
<v Speaker 1>months ago,</v>

156
00:09:31.171 --> 00:09:35.220
<v Speaker 1>this was reported in the New York Times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not a newspaper.</v>

157
00:09:35.221 --> 00:09:38.270
<v Speaker 1>I would say that would be intrinsically</v>
<v Speaker 1>biased against Venezuela.</v>

158
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:44.060
<v Speaker 1>Said that it was now illegal to diagnose</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cause of a child's death in a</v>

159
00:09:44.641 --> 00:09:49.641
<v Speaker 1>Venezuelan hospital as starvation</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the Venezuelans,</v>

160
00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:55.280
<v Speaker 1>Venezuelan government's answer to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem of children starving was to make</v>

161
00:09:55.980 --> 00:10:00.980
<v Speaker 1>it illegal to notice it in hospitals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a tyranny,</v>

162
00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:03.660
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a place where thought is not</v>

163
00:10:03.661 --> 00:10:05.760
<v Speaker 1>allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a place where free speech is not</v>

164
00:10:05.761 --> 00:10:10.020
<v Speaker 1>allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it seems to me that that's not a good</v>

165
00:10:10.021 --> 00:10:14.310
<v Speaker 1>place to go to say the least.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we've gone there many times in the</v>

166
00:10:14.311 --> 00:10:17.460
<v Speaker 1>last one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred and 50 years and we should</v>

167
00:10:17.461 --> 00:10:20.730
<v Speaker 1>perhaps think very hard about whether or</v>
<v Speaker 1>not we ever want to go there again.</v>
