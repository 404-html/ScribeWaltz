1
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.610
<v Speaker 1>And his brother and went to feed their father's flock and shuck him.</v>

2
00:00:09.611 --> 00:00:11.860
<v Speaker 1>So they took off and Israel said unto Joseph,</v>

3
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.200
<v Speaker 1>do you know what the I brethren feed the flock and check them common,</v>

4
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.260
<v Speaker 1>I will send thee unto him.</v>

5
00:00:16.261 --> 00:00:19.080
<v Speaker 1>And he said he had and he said to him,</v>

6
00:00:19.081 --> 00:00:19.351
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

7
00:00:19.351 --> 00:00:20.184
<v Speaker 1>up here on mine,</v>

8
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.890
<v Speaker 1>and when they saw him afar off,</v>

9
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.540
<v Speaker 1>even before he came near onto them,</v>

10
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.610
<v Speaker 1>they conspired against him to slay him.</v>

11
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.880
<v Speaker 1>Rough people act then,</v>

12
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

13
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.080
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

14
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.480
<v Speaker 1>this sort of thing is happening quite frequently.</v>

15
00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:34.813
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

16
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.080
<v Speaker 1>and they said to one another,</v>

17
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.120
<v Speaker 1>behold the dreamer cometh.</v>

18
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:40.441
<v Speaker 1>Come now,</v>

19
00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:42.000
<v Speaker 1>therefore let us slay him,</v>

20
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.770
<v Speaker 1>cast him into some pit and we will say some evil beast has devoured him and we</v>

21
00:00:46.771 --> 00:00:48.930
<v Speaker 1>shall see what becomes of his dreams.</v>

22
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.990
<v Speaker 1>So there's an echo of the Kate enables story there obviously.</v>

23
00:00:51.991 --> 00:00:52.824
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

24
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.780
<v Speaker 1>It's not quite as clear because in the Kate enables store able is clearly just</v>

25
00:00:58.781 --> 00:00:59.614
<v Speaker 1>doing well.</v>

26
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.190
<v Speaker 1>And here you can't quite get a handle on Joseph's character.</v>

27
00:01:03.191 --> 00:01:06.940
<v Speaker 1>You can't tell if he is actually the elect or if he's just a spoiled Brat with</v>

28
00:01:06.941 --> 00:01:08.140
<v Speaker 1>delusions of grandeur.</v>

29
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

30
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.653
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

31
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.790
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter because his brothers are so irritated at his,</v>

32
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.920
<v Speaker 1>the fact that he's favored and perhaps even the fact that he might be someone</v>

33
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:22.730
<v Speaker 1>destined for,</v>

34
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.080
<v Speaker 1>for something special,</v>

35
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.650
<v Speaker 1>that they find it perfectly reasonable to destroy that.</v>

36
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.151
<v Speaker 1>And it's so hard.</v>

37
00:01:29.151 --> 00:01:34.151
<v Speaker 1>It's so interesting how often that motif of pulling down an ideal manifest</v>

38
00:01:35.451 --> 00:01:36.830
<v Speaker 1>itself in these old stories,</v>

39
00:01:36.831 --> 00:01:37.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

40
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.930
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

41
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:38.390
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

42
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.580
<v Speaker 1>the pattern is established in the Cain and Abel Story.</v>

43
00:01:40.581 --> 00:01:42.410
<v Speaker 1>It just repeats and repeats and repeats.</v>

44
00:01:42.411 --> 00:01:43.880
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's dead true.</v>

45
00:01:43.881 --> 00:01:45.410
<v Speaker 1>I think it just repeats all the time,</v>

46
00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.250
<v Speaker 1>is that people are annoyed about how tragic their lives are.</v>

47
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.900
<v Speaker 1>They're annoyed that they're subject to malevolence and they're annoyed that</v>

48
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.600
<v Speaker 1>they're not doing as well as other people are doing.</v>

49
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:57.830
<v Speaker 1>And that makes them,</v>

50
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.140
<v Speaker 1>that puts them exactly into this state of mind.</v>

51
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.711
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

52
00:02:00.711 --> 00:02:02.450
<v Speaker 1>maybe with modern people,</v>

53
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.080
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to kill someone because you're resentful as a modern person,</v>

54
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.660
<v Speaker 1>you don't generally slay them and throw them into a pit.</v>

55
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:09.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

56
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.590
<v Speaker 1>what you do is you just killed them slowly over a few decades.</v>

57
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.350
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't obvious to me that that's any better.</v>

58
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.830
<v Speaker 1>So I've seen plenty of married couples who were in that situation.</v>

59
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.243
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

60
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.173
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

61
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.620
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

62
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.920
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

63
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.030
<v Speaker 1>this Mitch Hedberg,</v>

64
00:02:26.031 --> 00:02:28.130
<v Speaker 1>he used to complain about turtleneck phase.</v>

65
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.070
<v Speaker 1>It was like being strangled by a really weak midget,</v>

66
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:32.503
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

67
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.750
<v Speaker 1>it's probably really politically incorrect joke,</v>

68
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.090
<v Speaker 1>but it's a funny joke.</v>

69
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.433
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

70
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.553
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

71
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.410
<v Speaker 1>and then you see,</v>

72
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.230
<v Speaker 1>you see relationships that are like that.</v>

73
00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:48.620
<v Speaker 1>It's like each person has their hands around the neck of the other person,</v>

74
00:02:48.621 --> 00:02:52.100
<v Speaker 1>but they don't have enough courage to actually to squeeze it.</v>

75
00:02:52.101 --> 00:02:56.150
<v Speaker 1>Just put enough pressure on to s cut the circulation off a tiny bit.</v>

76
00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.440
<v Speaker 1>So the person just gets like a die over 30 year period.</v>

77
00:03:00.441 --> 00:03:01.610
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>
