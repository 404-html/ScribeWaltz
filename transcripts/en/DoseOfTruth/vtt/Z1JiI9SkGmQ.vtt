1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.930
<v Speaker 1>I started to think about belief systems,</v>

2
00:00:02.931 --> 00:00:03.764
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3
00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.920
<v Speaker 1>because you could say that each camp had its own belief system.</v>

4
00:00:06.921 --> 00:00:08.390
<v Speaker 1>The one in the West was derived.</v>

5
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:14.020
<v Speaker 1>It had a very lengthy history derived from the Greeks and the Romans and Jews</v>

6
00:00:14.841 --> 00:00:15.790
<v Speaker 1>and the Christians and,</v>

7
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.810
<v Speaker 1>and from various schools of philosophy and from the enlightenment and all of</v>

8
00:00:20.811 --> 00:00:21.081
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

9
00:00:21.081 --> 00:00:26.081
<v Speaker 1>And then the Soviet Union was basically predicated on a rational philosophy that</v>

10
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.960
<v Speaker 1>that opposed the axioms that the West had evolved and each group organized their</v>

11
00:00:34.641 --> 00:00:35.780
<v Speaker 1>societies around that.</v>

12
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.963
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

13
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:38.380
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

14
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.740
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

15
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.780
<v Speaker 1>I took political science for quite a long time.</v>

16
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.720
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

17
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.820
<v Speaker 1>And the political scientists and the economists,</v>

18
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.050
<v Speaker 1>they basically thought that people competed over resources.</v>

19
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:51.793
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

20
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.910
<v Speaker 1>but that wasn't a very good answer as far as I was concerned because it wasn't</v>

21
00:00:54.911 --> 00:00:58.060
<v Speaker 1>obvious to me why people valued the resources they value.</v>

22
00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.470
<v Speaker 1>There was the economist,</v>

23
00:00:59.471 --> 00:01:02.260
<v Speaker 1>just assume that there's resources that you value,</v>

24
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.071
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

25
00:01:03.071 --> 00:01:05.110
<v Speaker 1>people can value a lot of different things.</v>

26
00:01:05.111 --> 00:01:05.660
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

27
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.180
<v Speaker 1>it's not exactly fixed.</v>

28
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

29
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.970
<v Speaker 1>you tend to value food very highly if you're hungry,</v>

30
00:01:09.971 --> 00:01:10.511
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>

31
00:01:10.511 --> 00:01:11.291
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

32
00:01:11.291 --> 00:01:15.790
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of things that we value and that we want that seem somewhat</v>

33
00:01:15.791 --> 00:01:16.660
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary.</v>

34
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.070
<v Speaker 1>Someone like a decision.</v>

35
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.840
<v Speaker 1>So I got more interested in why people valued things and what it meant to value</v>

36
00:01:22.841 --> 00:01:26.260
<v Speaker 1>something and then what it meant to believe something.</v>

37
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.880
<v Speaker 1>And then how it could be that someone could believe something so deeply that</v>

38
00:01:33.851 --> 00:01:38.740
<v Speaker 1>they would risk their own death to protect it or at least risk the death of</v>

39
00:01:38.741 --> 00:01:39.574
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>

40
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.940
<v Speaker 1>And maybe on a massive scale like man,</v>

41
00:01:42.941 --> 00:01:44.380
<v Speaker 1>people are committed to their,</v>

42
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:45.670
<v Speaker 1>to their system.</v>

43
00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:47.140
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

44
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

45
00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.590
<v Speaker 1>a system of belief is not just a system of belief.</v>

46
00:01:50.591 --> 00:01:54.190
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things that I came to understand is that it's not appropriate</v>

47
00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.650
<v Speaker 1>to make this too psychological.</v>

48
00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.810
<v Speaker 1>People defend their belief systems,</v>

49
00:01:58.811 --> 00:02:00.010
<v Speaker 1>but that's not exactly right.</v>

50
00:02:00.011 --> 00:02:00.580
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

51
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.440
<v Speaker 1>we have a shared belief system.</v>

52
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.550
<v Speaker 1>Well it's sufficiently shared so that here we are,</v>

53
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.110
<v Speaker 1>we don't know each other.</v>

54
00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.700
<v Speaker 1>We're a bunch of primates,</v>

55
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.600
<v Speaker 1>we're in this room and it's peaceful and no one's scared.</v>

56
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.220
<v Speaker 1>And that's pretty amazing.</v>

57
00:02:16.221 --> 00:02:18.920
<v Speaker 1>And that means that we're all acting out our roles.</v>

58
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.170
<v Speaker 1>So we're acting out or roles.</v>

59
00:02:21.171 --> 00:02:26.030
<v Speaker 1>And we have an expectation with regards to those roles and those two things</v>

60
00:02:26.031 --> 00:02:30.170
<v Speaker 1>match and that's the important thing and we'll talk about that a lot.</v>

61
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.120
<v Speaker 1>It isn't the belief system or the integrity of the belief system even it's the</v>

62
00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:39.620
<v Speaker 1>match between the belief system and the actions of the other people within the</v>

63
00:02:39.621 --> 00:02:40.454
<v Speaker 1>belief system.</v>

64
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.560
<v Speaker 1>What you want to maintain is that match.</v>

65
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.010
<v Speaker 1>You want to act out your beliefs in the world and you want what you want to</v>

66
00:02:48.081 --> 00:02:48.860
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

67
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:49.611
<v Speaker 1>That's good thing.</v>

68
00:02:49.611 --> 00:02:52.190
<v Speaker 1>You get what you want and you validate your belief system.</v>

69
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.233
<v Speaker 1>Great,</v>

70
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.740
<v Speaker 1>perfect security,</v>

71
00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.760
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of that is if we're interacting even right now,</v>

72
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.470
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole set of expectations that are governing what we're doing.</v>

73
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.940
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't want me to take your,</v>

74
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.010
<v Speaker 1>your little tablet there and smash it.</v>

75
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.600
<v Speaker 1>That would be shocking,</v>

76
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

77
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.250
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't know what the hell to do.</v>

78
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:10.000
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

79
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
<v Speaker 1>You'd be somewhere different if I did that and you would know where you were and</v>

80
00:03:16.511 --> 00:03:20.830
<v Speaker 1>that's another thing to know because that's a fundamental difference.</v>

81
00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.080
<v Speaker 1>There is a fundamental difference between knowing where you are and not knowing</v>

82
00:03:26.531 --> 00:03:27.364
<v Speaker 1>where you are.</v>

83
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:28.870
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

84
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.940
<v Speaker 1>in some sense the fundamental difference.</v>

85
00:03:30.941 --> 00:03:34.240
<v Speaker 1>You can think about it as the distinction between explored an unexplored</v>

86
00:03:34.241 --> 00:03:35.074
<v Speaker 1>territory,</v>

87
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.220
<v Speaker 1>but you have to.</v>
