1
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.430
<v Speaker 1>I would like to ask you about this as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2
00:00:08.431 --> 00:00:12.760
<v Speaker 1>because as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a man would go yuck pain in a country</v>

3
00:00:12.761 --> 00:00:14.260
<v Speaker 1>like Sweden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to,</v>

4
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.700
<v Speaker 1>I would say that I think a lot of boys</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least,</v>

5
00:00:19.701 --> 00:00:22.640
<v Speaker 1>or I'm confused what it means to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

6
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.700
<v Speaker 1>And then you have these public figures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adult males admitting to collective</v>

7
00:00:29.901 --> 00:00:33.520
<v Speaker 1>guilt and trying to be sort of the new</v>
<v Speaker 1>new mail,</v>

8
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which admits to gill feminist,</v>

9
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.460
<v Speaker 1>the good man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you are</v>

10
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.370
<v Speaker 2>fat Tomcat of a man resting on top of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the warm TV,</v>

11
00:00:44.371 --> 00:00:45.580
<v Speaker 2>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's,</v>

12
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.090
<v Speaker 2>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you say moral virtue consists</v>

13
00:00:48.091 --> 00:00:50.490
<v Speaker 2>in his harmlessness exactly.</v>

14
00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:54.760
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>

15
00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the advice to give to,</v>

16
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.890
<v Speaker 1>because what I find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see a lot of men trying to find their</v>

17
00:01:00.891 --> 00:01:04.850
<v Speaker 1>way and</v>
<v Speaker 1>find out what it means to be a man.</v>

18
00:01:04.851 --> 00:01:09.820
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's a lot of them turns</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you and a,</v>

19
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.640
<v Speaker 1>or a person like Jocko Willink and let,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let interviewed you.</v>

20
00:01:13.641 --> 00:01:15.320
<v Speaker 1>And because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

21
00:01:15.321 --> 00:01:18.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and why do you think that it's,</v>

22
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it the because it doesn't seem so</v>

23
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.130
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not sugarcoating life that you're</v>

24
00:01:26.131 --> 00:01:26.964
<v Speaker 1>not giving them</v>

25
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.600
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

26
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.050
<v Speaker 2>the funny thing about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well there's a couple of things that I'm</v>

27
00:01:30.051 --> 00:01:32.310
<v Speaker 2>doing that are different from what</v>
<v Speaker 2>people usually do.</v>

28
00:01:32.311 --> 00:01:34.680
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so in the last 20 years,</v>

29
00:01:34.681 --> 00:01:38.760
<v Speaker 2>the constant message to young people is</v>
<v Speaker 2>self esteem,</v>

30
00:01:38.761 --> 00:01:40.920
<v Speaker 2>self esteem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel good about yourself.</v>

31
00:01:40.921 --> 00:01:42.180
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't buy that.</v>

32
00:01:42.181 --> 00:01:44.880
<v Speaker 2>I think that you look at yourself in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mirror and you think,</v>

33
00:01:44.881 --> 00:01:47.130
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could be a hell of a lot better than I</v>

34
00:01:47.131 --> 00:01:49.080
<v Speaker 2>am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

35
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.680
<v Speaker 2>and the thing is there's nothing more</v>
<v Speaker 2>complimentary to tell a young person</v>

36
00:01:52.681 --> 00:01:53.910
<v Speaker 2>than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

37
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.820
<v Speaker 2>look at you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a wreck.</v>

38
00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.920
<v Speaker 2>Grow the hell up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so much more to you than your</v>

39
00:01:59.921 --> 00:02:01.930
<v Speaker 2>manifesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you can hardly imagine it.</v>

40
00:02:01.931 --> 00:02:02.830
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

41
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.570
<v Speaker 2>you think that's a criticism?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

42
00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.711
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

43
00:02:05.711 --> 00:02:07.390
<v Speaker 2>It's a great compliment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

44
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.580
<v Speaker 2>look at how much more you could bring</v>
<v Speaker 2>out into the world.</v>

45
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.090
<v Speaker 2>Get your aggression under control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>strengthen yourself.</v>

46
00:02:15.091 --> 00:02:18.900
<v Speaker 2>Like take on some responsibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See if you have enough bloody courage to</v>

47
00:02:18.901 --> 00:02:21.510
<v Speaker 2>tell the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Put your life together.</v>

48
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.030
<v Speaker 2>Stop whining.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

49
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.900
<v Speaker 2>The man eat that up because no one's</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever told them that.</v>

50
00:02:27.901 --> 00:02:30.970
<v Speaker 2>Which just makes breaks my heart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

51
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.110
<v Speaker 2>it's so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

52
00:02:34.111 --> 00:02:37.170
<v Speaker 2>the boys are pulling out of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're pulling out a university,</v>

53
00:02:37.171 --> 00:02:40.500
<v Speaker 2>they're pulling out of life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're pulling out of marriage,</v>

54
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.260
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and because of that,</v>

55
00:02:43.261 --> 00:02:47.190
<v Speaker 2>they're more awkward and unsophisticated</v>
<v Speaker 2>than they would otherwise be in much</v>

56
00:02:47.191 --> 00:02:50.670
<v Speaker 2>more prone to make sexual errors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of which are,</v>

57
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>predatory malevolence in a small</v>

58
00:02:54.571 --> 00:02:55.830
<v Speaker 2>proportion of cases.</v>

59
00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.450
<v Speaker 2>But it's another one of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>situations,</v>

60
00:02:57.451 --> 00:02:59.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like imagine that one in a hundred men</v>

61
00:02:59.711 --> 00:03:01.940
<v Speaker 2>are sexual predators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

62
00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.700
<v Speaker 2>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's one in 50 but let's go with</v>

63
00:03:04.701 --> 00:03:06.380
<v Speaker 2>one in a hundred.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

64
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.650
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that small proportion commit all of this</v>

65
00:03:11.651 --> 00:03:14.770
<v Speaker 2>sexual predation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you look at criminals,</v>

66
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.510
<v Speaker 2>it's a parade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

67
00:03:16.511 --> 00:03:17.590
<v Speaker 2>distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

68
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.630
<v Speaker 2>5% of the criminals produce something</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

69
00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.260
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the overwhelming majority of the crimes,</v>

70
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.930
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a small coterie of specialized</v>

71
00:03:27.931 --> 00:03:30.510
<v Speaker 2>people who are responsible for all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>criminality.</v>

72
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.930
<v Speaker 2>Lots of people are in prison because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did one highness thing,</v>

73
00:03:33.931 --> 00:03:37.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they got enraged or drunk and did</v>

74
00:03:37.261 --> 00:03:40.980
<v Speaker 2>something violent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's the serial criminal types</v>

75
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.930
<v Speaker 2>and they're the ones that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do all,</v>

76
00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.750
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they like we had one guy in Toronto for</v>

77
00:03:45.751 --> 00:03:48.330
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who ran a bike theft ring and they</v>

78
00:03:48.331 --> 00:03:52.540
<v Speaker 2>finally nailed him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like there weren't any bikes stolen</v>

79
00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:56.620
<v Speaker 2>in Toronto after that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just him and his little coterie</v>

80
00:03:56.621 --> 00:03:57.101
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

81
00:03:57.101 --> 00:04:01.150
<v Speaker 2>organized bike thieves and these guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are being outed,</v>

82
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.710
<v Speaker 2>the serial predators,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are responsible like one,</v>

83
00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:10.060
<v Speaker 2>one spread predatory guy can prey on who</v>
<v Speaker 2>knows,</v>

84
00:04:10.061 --> 00:04:13.270
<v Speaker 2>500 females,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousand females in the lifetime,</v>

85
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.740
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

86
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.390
<v Speaker 1>it's almost seems like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is</v>

87
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.780
<v Speaker 1>a lot of guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was one of these guys who sort of turn</v>

88
00:04:24.781 --> 00:04:26.750
<v Speaker 1>away from society for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for awhile,</v>

89
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.360
<v Speaker 1>like into computer games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the slacker identity where,</v>

90
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.530
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's always been there like you</v>

91
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.690
<v Speaker 1>turned to a like away from all</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities,</v>

92
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.220
<v Speaker 1>but the opportunities to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so much Florida now,</v>

93
00:04:47.221 --> 00:04:47.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

94
00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.751
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

95
00:04:47.751 --> 00:04:49.100
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the lost boys,</v>

96
00:04:49.101 --> 00:04:53.060
<v Speaker 2>like in Peter Pan Right there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it never land and they never grow up.</v>

97
00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.360
<v Speaker 2>And Peter Pan is their leader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

98
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.810
<v Speaker 2>that's the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not surprising because it's</v>

99
00:04:59.811 --> 00:05:03.260
<v Speaker 2>easier to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's easier to occupy yourself trivially</v>

100
00:05:03.261 --> 00:05:07.640
<v Speaker 2>than it is to do something difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like there's a big tendency in that</v>

101
00:05:07.641 --> 00:05:11.120
<v Speaker 2>direction to begin with because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>easier to do nothing than to take</v>

102
00:05:11.121 --> 00:05:14.480
<v Speaker 2>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's easier to play games than to plan</v>

103
00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:18.230
<v Speaker 2>for the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's easier to be resentful and angry</v>

104
00:05:18.231 --> 00:05:20.510
<v Speaker 2>than it is to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

105
00:05:20.511 --> 00:05:22.520
<v Speaker 2>to shoulder you're vulnerability</v>
<v Speaker 2>properly.</v>

106
00:05:22.521 --> 00:05:27.110
<v Speaker 2>And then when you add on to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that if you go out into the</v>

107
00:05:27.111 --> 00:05:31.430
<v Speaker 2>world and try to strive forward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're nothing but a predatory</v>

108
00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.210
<v Speaker 2>patriarch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then well,</v>

109
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.440
<v Speaker 2>it's just one more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just the icing on the cake.</v>

110
00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.720
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a friend who was like that he</v>

111
00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.390
<v Speaker 2>pulled back from the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

112
00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:50.290
<v Speaker 2>and bill because he believed that active</v>
<v Speaker 2>masculinity was a pathological force.</v>

113
00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.590
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he poisoned himself terribly because of</v>

114
00:05:54.591 --> 00:05:56.750
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he committed suicide when he was 40.</v>

115
00:05:56.751 --> 00:05:59.340
<v Speaker 2>He hooked an exhaust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

116
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.440
<v Speaker 2>up hose onto his exhaust pipe and gassed</v>
<v Speaker 2>himself up in the mountains in Alberta.</v>

117
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.360
<v Speaker 2>And that was the logical consequence of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of his self hatred.</v>

118
00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:09.860
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

119
00:06:09.861 --> 00:06:13.070
<v Speaker 2>if you're so pathological,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you just do it yourself in and</v>

120
00:06:13.071 --> 00:06:14.990
<v Speaker 2>hiding like that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

121
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.300
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's obviously not the full fledged</v>

122
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:18.890
<v Speaker 2>manifestation of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

123
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.250
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

124
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.150
<v Speaker 2>believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's on the road.</v>

125
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.680
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

126
00:06:24.681 --> 00:06:26.450
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been talking to all these young</v>

127
00:06:26.451 --> 00:06:28.280
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they come to my biblical lectures for</v>

128
00:06:28.281 --> 00:06:30.320
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the message is always the same.</v>

129
00:06:30.321 --> 00:06:33.590
<v Speaker 2>It's like stand the hell up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get the hell out there in the world.</v>

130
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:39.640
<v Speaker 2>Take local responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put yourself together because there's</v>

131
00:06:39.831 --> 00:06:44.120
<v Speaker 2>nothing more dangerous than a weak man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the problem is,</v>

132
00:06:44.121 --> 00:06:49.040
<v Speaker 2>is that we're encouraging men to be weak</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we have this pathological idea</v>

133
00:06:49.041 --> 00:06:52.880
<v Speaker 2>that there's that strength and tyranny</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the same thing.</v>

134
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.480
<v Speaker 2>And that's that Animus I was talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about earlier though women,</v>

135
00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.690
<v Speaker 2>it's not only women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the feminist types,</v>

136
00:06:59.691 --> 00:07:03.260
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who insist upon the pathology of the</v>

137
00:07:03.261 --> 00:07:07.880
<v Speaker 2>Patriarchy cannot distinguish between</v>
<v Speaker 2>competence and power.</v>

138
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.200
<v Speaker 2>They see everything because they have</v>
<v Speaker 2>this vague and undifferentiated sense of</v>

139
00:07:14.571 --> 00:07:17.930
<v Speaker 2>masculinity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say they see everything that is</v>

140
00:07:17.931 --> 00:07:22.370
<v Speaker 2>associated with authority as equivalent</v>
<v Speaker 2>to tyranny.</v>
