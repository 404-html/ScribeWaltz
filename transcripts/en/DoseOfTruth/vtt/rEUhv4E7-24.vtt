1
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.020
<v Speaker 1>Is the pre cosmo Garnett chaos.</v>

2
00:00:08.021 --> 00:00:08.860
<v Speaker 1>This is from</v>

3
00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:11.740
<v Speaker 1>William James,</v>

4
00:00:11.741 --> 00:00:12.880
<v Speaker 1>who was a pragmatist,</v>

5
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.910
<v Speaker 1>lived on each coast at about the end of the 18 hundreds.</v>

6
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.010
<v Speaker 1>He was one of the founders of modern psychology.</v>

7
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.770
<v Speaker 1>He liked to sniff nitric nitrous oxide,</v>

8
00:00:20.771 --> 00:00:21.940
<v Speaker 1>which is a hallucinogen.</v>

9
00:00:21.941 --> 00:00:26.080
<v Speaker 1>He was sort of like the world's first major league hippie and he wrote sort of</v>

10
00:00:26.081 --> 00:00:29.950
<v Speaker 1>hippie poetry as a consequence of his nitrous oxide experimentation.</v>

11
00:00:29.951 --> 00:00:33.670
<v Speaker 1>And here's part of what a he derived from his experiences.</v>

12
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.533
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

13
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

14
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.850
<v Speaker 1>pure experience is the name which I give to the original flux of life before</v>

15
00:00:39.851 --> 00:00:41.110
<v Speaker 1>reflection is categorized,</v>

16
00:00:41.111 --> 00:00:44.770
<v Speaker 1>it only newborn babes and persons in semi coma from sleep,</v>

17
00:00:44.771 --> 00:00:45.161
<v Speaker 1>drugs,</v>

18
00:00:45.161 --> 00:00:46.360
<v Speaker 1>illnesses or blows.</v>

19
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.500
<v Speaker 1>It can have an experience pure in the literal sense of awe that which is not yet</v>

20
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.850
<v Speaker 1>any definite what potential potential cause you might think,</v>

21
00:00:57.821 --> 00:00:59.050
<v Speaker 1>well what's the world made of?</v>

22
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.060
<v Speaker 1>It's made out of actuality,</v>

23
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

24
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.160
<v Speaker 1>That's not how you act.</v>

25
00:01:03.161 --> 00:01:06.760
<v Speaker 1>You Act as if the world's made out of potential and you interact with that</v>

26
00:01:06.761 --> 00:01:07.594
<v Speaker 1>potential.</v>

27
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.110
<v Speaker 1>And what James is saying is that there are times when you experience something</v>

28
00:01:11.111 --> 00:01:14.830
<v Speaker 1>that's akin to relatively pure potential.</v>

29
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.010
<v Speaker 1>And then you might ask yourself whether or not potential is real,</v>

30
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.690
<v Speaker 1>which is a really interesting question,</v>

31
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.930
<v Speaker 1>but I can say regardless of how you answered that question,</v>

32
00:01:22.931 --> 00:01:27.250
<v Speaker 1>you act as if it's real and you'll also feel guilty if someone that you love</v>

33
00:01:27.251 --> 00:01:28.150
<v Speaker 1>comes up to you and says,</v>

34
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.910
<v Speaker 1>you're not living up to your potential.</v>

35
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.630
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

36
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:32.770
<v Speaker 1>what the hell does that mean?</v>

37
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.150
<v Speaker 1>What does it mean?</v>

38
00:01:34.151 --> 00:01:37.540
<v Speaker 1>It means you're not becoming that which you could be.</v>

39
00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.471
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

40
00:01:38.471 --> 00:01:39.304
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>

41
00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.671
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

42
00:01:39.671 --> 00:01:39.881
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:01:39.881 --> 00:01:40.810
<v Speaker 1>we're materialists.</v>

44
00:01:40.811 --> 00:01:42.040
<v Speaker 1>How are we going to measure that?</v>

45
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.910
<v Speaker 1>You can't touch it.</v>

46
00:01:42.911 --> 00:01:43.750
<v Speaker 1>You can't taste it.</v>

47
00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:44.650
<v Speaker 1>You can't see it.</v>

48
00:01:44.651 --> 00:01:45.790
<v Speaker 1>You can't measure it.</v>

49
00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.780
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

50
00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:47.050
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

51
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.890
<v Speaker 1>but nonetheless,</v>

52
00:01:47.891 --> 00:01:52.891
<v Speaker 1>it's like the substance of being and being his potential as well as actuality.</v>

53
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.630
<v Speaker 1>And we're grappling always with the potential.</v>

54
00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.640
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what James is talking about.</v>

55
00:01:57.641 --> 00:01:58.570
<v Speaker 1>Pure potential.</v>

56
00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.750
<v Speaker 1>I like to think of it as latent information full both of oneness and menace,</v>

57
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.660
<v Speaker 1>but in respects that don't appear changing throughout yet.</v>

58
00:02:07.661 --> 00:02:09.370
<v Speaker 1>So confusedly that it's phases.</v>

59
00:02:09.371 --> 00:02:13.630
<v Speaker 1>Interpenetrate sounds like the Yin and Yang symbol and no points either of</v>

60
00:02:13.631 --> 00:02:16.420
<v Speaker 1>distinction or of identity can be caught.</v>

61
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.270
<v Speaker 1>Here's his poem.</v>

62
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.200
<v Speaker 1>No verbiage can give it because the verbiage is other incoherent,</v>

63
00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.540
<v Speaker 1>coherent the same and it fades and it's infinite and it's infinite.</v>

64
00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.170
<v Speaker 1>Don't you see the difference?</v>

65
00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.570
<v Speaker 1>Don't you see the identity constantly?</v>

66
00:02:34.571 --> 00:02:36.340
<v Speaker 1>Opposites United the same.</v>

67
00:02:36.341 --> 00:02:38.290
<v Speaker 1>Me telling you to write and not to right.</v>

68
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.520
<v Speaker 1>Extreme,</v>

69
00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:40.661
<v Speaker 1>extreme,</v>

70
00:02:40.661 --> 00:02:41.740
<v Speaker 1>extreme something.</v>

71
00:02:41.741 --> 00:02:42.940
<v Speaker 1>And other than that thing,</v>

72
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.850
<v Speaker 1>intoxication and otherness than intoxication.</v>

73
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.740
<v Speaker 1>Every attempted betterment.</v>

74
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.070
<v Speaker 1>Every attempted other men is a,</v>

75
00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.520
<v Speaker 1>it fades and it fades forever and forever as we move.</v>
