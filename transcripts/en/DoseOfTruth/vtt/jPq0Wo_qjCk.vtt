1
00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.770
<v Speaker 1>You really can't tell the meaning of someone's life till the very end.</v>

2
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:05.030
<v Speaker 1>It's for the same reason,</v>

3
00:00:05.031 --> 00:00:05.241
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4
00:00:05.241 --> 00:00:06.074
<v Speaker 1>Is that</v>

5
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.390
<v Speaker 1>how all the pieces fit together in the story or in the life is not necessarily</v>

6
00:00:11.391 --> 00:00:13.070
<v Speaker 1>determined until the final moment.</v>

7
00:00:13.071 --> 00:00:14.630
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's part of the reason too.</v>

8
00:00:14.631 --> 00:00:16.490
<v Speaker 1>Why among Catholics,</v>

9
00:00:16.491 --> 00:00:17.170
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

10
00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.920
<v Speaker 1>in Christians in general,</v>

11
00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.250
<v Speaker 1>there's an idea that salvation can always be attained,</v>

12
00:00:22.251 --> 00:00:22.461
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

13
00:00:22.461 --> 00:00:23.540
<v Speaker 1>Right up til the last moment,</v>

14
00:00:23.541 --> 00:00:25.280
<v Speaker 1>no matter what your life was like and you think,</v>

15
00:00:25.281 --> 00:00:26.600
<v Speaker 1>well that's a pretty cheap trick.</v>

16
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.690
<v Speaker 1>You don't because you can run around and doing terrible things their whole life.</v>

17
00:00:29.691 --> 00:00:31.700
<v Speaker 1>But as long as you get it together the last second,</v>

18
00:00:31.701 --> 00:00:32.570
<v Speaker 1>then you're Scott free.</v>

19
00:00:32.571 --> 00:00:34.790
<v Speaker 1>But if you think about it in terms of a story,</v>

20
00:00:34.791 --> 00:00:38.510
<v Speaker 1>then you can understand how that could conceivably be the case.</v>

21
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.370
<v Speaker 1>And it's for this reason,</v>

22
00:00:40.371 --> 00:00:40.791
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

23
00:00:40.791 --> 00:00:44.690
<v Speaker 1>that this lecture in particular makes me nervous more than any of the other ones</v>

24
00:00:44.691 --> 00:00:48.650
<v Speaker 1>I do because I've been telling you a story that's basically 40 hours long,</v>

25
00:00:48.651 --> 00:00:48.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

26
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.060
<v Speaker 1>And it's spoken for them.</v>

27
00:00:50.061 --> 00:00:55.061
<v Speaker 1>And then who knows how long and it's written for him and it's,</v>

28
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.680
<v Speaker 1>it's complicated to pull it together properly.</v>

29
00:00:57.681 --> 00:01:00.620
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly because as far as I've been concerned,</v>

30
00:01:00.621 --> 00:01:04.850
<v Speaker 1>we've been talking about issues in psychology that are more difficult than any</v>

31
00:01:04.851 --> 00:01:05.630
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

32
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.111
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

33
00:01:06.111 --> 00:01:06.950
<v Speaker 1>conceptually,</v>

34
00:01:06.951 --> 00:01:09.020
<v Speaker 1>even from a neuropsychological perspective,</v>

35
00:01:09.021 --> 00:01:12.650
<v Speaker 1>because I've been offering you a model of the way the brain processes the</v>

36
00:01:12.651 --> 00:01:15.230
<v Speaker 1>environment that I think is really novel and,</v>

37
00:01:15.231 --> 00:01:18.350
<v Speaker 1>and I think it reflects the current state of neuroscience.</v>

38
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.570
<v Speaker 1>But more than that,</v>

39
00:01:20.571 --> 00:01:23.750
<v Speaker 1>there's the problem that we've been dealing with issues all the way along of</v>

40
00:01:23.751 --> 00:01:28.610
<v Speaker 1>life and death and of war and destruction and of the possibility for all</v>

41
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.110
<v Speaker 1>clearheaded optimism,</v>

42
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.411
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

43
00:01:30.411 --> 00:01:30.750
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

44
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.640
<v Speaker 1>a possibility,</v>

45
00:01:31.641 --> 00:01:33.500
<v Speaker 1>which as we've discussed,</v>

46
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.040
<v Speaker 1>more or less escape toll stories say for most of his life,</v>

47
00:01:37.041 --> 00:01:37.251
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

48
00:01:37.251 --> 00:01:40.340
<v Speaker 1>Because when Tolstoy woke up from his delusions,</v>

49
00:01:40.341 --> 00:01:41.900
<v Speaker 1>he looked at the world and he said,</v>

50
00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:42.680
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

51
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.680
<v Speaker 1>clearly it's such a terrible place that as if you're not looking at it through</v>

52
00:01:48.171 --> 00:01:49.430
<v Speaker 1>the veils of illusion,</v>

53
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.450
<v Speaker 1>there was no way that you can do anything but stand in opposition to it.</v>

54
00:01:53.451 --> 00:01:55.550
<v Speaker 1>Once you understand its basic structure,</v>

55
00:01:55.551 --> 00:01:55.821
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

56
00:01:55.821 --> 00:02:00.821
<v Speaker 1>Suffering and innocent suffering and complete vulnerability and the whole</v>

57
00:02:01.161 --> 00:02:03.560
<v Speaker 1>existential mass that makes up life.</v>

58
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.480
<v Speaker 1>How it turns out that Tolstoy overcame his</v>

59
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.000
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

60
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.810
<v Speaker 1>rationally induced cynicism and it kind of mystical way.</v>

61
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.830
<v Speaker 1>He had a dream that he was suspended from some transcendent space by a belt</v>

62
00:02:20.831 --> 00:02:21.940
<v Speaker 1>around the middle of his waist,</v>

63
00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:24.430
<v Speaker 1>which hung them over a pit of chaos.</v>

64
00:02:24.431 --> 00:02:28.210
<v Speaker 1>And in that image he found comfort and fair enough,</v>

65
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.290
<v Speaker 1>it's a powerful image,</v>

66
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.150
<v Speaker 1>but it's not well delineated,</v>

67
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.810
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

68
00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.290
<v Speaker 1>And it worked well for Tolstoy and you can see that the image has power,</v>

69
00:02:35.291 --> 00:02:36.124
<v Speaker 1>but you can't,</v>

70
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.680
<v Speaker 1>you can't grab it with your rational mind.</v>

71
00:02:38.681 --> 00:02:41.500
<v Speaker 1>You can't take it into pieces and analyze it as an argument.</v>

72
00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.470
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we do if we're intellectuals,</v>

73
00:02:44.471 --> 00:02:44.651
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

74
00:02:44.651 --> 00:02:48.850
<v Speaker 1>We try to understand the detailed structure of something.</v>

75
00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.420
<v Speaker 1>And I think the detailed structure of what Tolstoy apprehended as optimistic is</v>

76
00:02:55.121 --> 00:02:56.590
<v Speaker 1>actually comprehensible.</v>

77
00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.650
<v Speaker 1>And we've been working that and circling around the entire course of this</v>

78
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:04.750
<v Speaker 1>lecture series.</v>

79
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.490
<v Speaker 1>But I found with this material that with each circling around the target,</v>

80
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.440
<v Speaker 1>it gets clearer and clearer.</v>

81
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.191
<v Speaker 1>It's a funny thing.</v>

82
00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:16.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're looking at something that's too complicated to see all at once.</v>

83
00:03:16.691 --> 00:03:19.930
<v Speaker 1>So you have to look at it from multiple different perspectives and again and</v>

84
00:03:19.931 --> 00:03:20.231
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

85
00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:21.340
<v Speaker 1>And each time you look at it,</v>

86
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.210
<v Speaker 1>it becomes clearer and clearer.</v>

87
00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.720
<v Speaker 1>That still the case for me when I go through this material,</v>

88
00:03:25.721 --> 00:03:26.680
<v Speaker 1>every time I go through it,</v>

89
00:03:26.681 --> 00:03:26.981
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

90
00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:27.311
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

91
00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:29.350
<v Speaker 1>that piece fits there and that piece fits there.</v>

92
00:03:29.351 --> 00:03:31.540
<v Speaker 1>And that's how that makes sense.</v>

93
00:03:31.541 --> 00:03:32.141
<v Speaker 1>And Oh,</v>

94
00:03:32.141 --> 00:03:35.110
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot more remarkable than I thought it was to begin with and so on.</v>

95
00:03:35.111 --> 00:03:38.170
<v Speaker 1>And it seems fundamentally in exhaustible and of course that's what you'd expect</v>

96
00:03:38.171 --> 00:03:39.070
<v Speaker 1>from deep,</v>

97
00:03:39.071 --> 00:03:39.970
<v Speaker 1>deep stories,</v>

98
00:03:39.971 --> 00:03:40.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

99
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.840
<v Speaker 1>Stories that have been around for thousands and thousands of years wouldn't have</v>

100
00:03:43.841 --> 00:03:48.190
<v Speaker 1>been around for thousands and thousands of years unless they were in some sense</v>

101
00:03:48.191 --> 00:03:49.120
<v Speaker 1>inexhaustible.</v>

102
00:03:49.121 --> 00:03:52.420
<v Speaker 1>And we've talked about some of the processes that might contribute to that in</v>

103
00:03:52.421 --> 00:03:53.470
<v Speaker 1>exhaust stability.</v>

104
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.400
<v Speaker 1>So at the beginning of the lecture series,</v>

105
00:03:57.401 --> 00:04:01.750
<v Speaker 1>I told you to consider the assumption that there was more than one way of</v>

106
00:04:01.751 --> 00:04:02.710
<v Speaker 1>looking at the world,</v>

107
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.580
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

108
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.990
<v Speaker 1>There was the standard materialists sort of scientific viewpoint,</v>

109
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.830
<v Speaker 1>which was that the world was made up of objects independently existent us among</v>

110
00:04:11.831 --> 00:04:12.664
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

111
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.940
<v Speaker 1>the objects have no intrinsic value one way or another and the issue of meaning</v>

112
00:04:18.251 --> 00:04:22.120
<v Speaker 1>per se wasn't included in that account.</v>

113
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.721
<v Speaker 1>And then I said,</v>

114
00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:23.201
<v Speaker 1>well wait,</v>

115
00:04:23.201 --> 00:04:25.780
<v Speaker 1>there's another way of looking at the world that we spent just as much time</v>

116
00:04:25.781 --> 00:04:28.330
<v Speaker 1>developing that we utilize even more.</v>

117
00:04:28.331 --> 00:04:29.530
<v Speaker 1>And that's a narrative.</v>

118
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.720
<v Speaker 1>That's the narrative way of looking at the world to consider the nature of</v>

119
00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:39.721
<v Speaker 1>experience rather than the nature of objects as real to consider your experience</v>

120
00:04:40.151 --> 00:04:40.601
<v Speaker 1>as real,</v>

121
00:04:40.601 --> 00:04:44.680
<v Speaker 1>even though it includes things that can't be easily and tangibly identified.</v>

122
00:04:44.681 --> 00:04:45.940
<v Speaker 1>Things like emotions,</v>

123
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.810
<v Speaker 1>which of course you find compelling sometimes even beyond your will.</v>

124
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.910
<v Speaker 1>Things like motivational states,</v>

125
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.170
<v Speaker 1>fantasies,</v>

126
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:54.130
<v Speaker 1>ideals,</v>

127
00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.750
<v Speaker 1>all the things that compel your behavior and give you some sense that there's a</v>

128
00:04:58.751 --> 00:05:03.550
<v Speaker 1>direction to life and people who study emotion and perception have come to</v>

129
00:05:03.551 --> 00:05:08.551
<v Speaker 1>understand that the act of transforming the world into something simply made out</v>

130
00:05:09.251 --> 00:05:11.230
<v Speaker 1>of objects is incredibly difficult.</v>

131
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.620
<v Speaker 1>It's so difficult that we haven't been able to design machines that can do it at</v>

132
00:05:14.621 --> 00:05:15.400
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

133
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.290
<v Speaker 1>It turns out also that when we look at the world,</v>

134
00:05:17.291 --> 00:05:19.540
<v Speaker 1>we're not just looking at it with our visual systems,</v>

135
00:05:19.541 --> 00:05:23.170
<v Speaker 1>but we're looking at it with our motor output systems and our emotions so that</v>

136
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.640
<v Speaker 1>when you look at something like a chair which just stands there for you,</v>

137
00:05:27.641 --> 00:05:28.540
<v Speaker 1>like an object,</v>

138
00:05:28.541 --> 00:05:31.870
<v Speaker 1>it turns out that the mechanical systems,</v>

139
00:05:31.871 --> 00:05:36.370
<v Speaker 1>the motor systems that you would use to use the chair to sit on it are activated</v>

140
00:05:36.371 --> 00:05:37.660
<v Speaker 1>during the act of perception.</v>

141
00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.060
<v Speaker 1>It also turns out sometimes that when you look at something,</v>

142
00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.150
<v Speaker 1>especially if it's something you've done to understand and that it's and that</v>

143
00:05:43.151 --> 00:05:43.984
<v Speaker 1>scares you,</v>

144
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.470
<v Speaker 1>you actually react to it,</v>

145
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.000
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize it with your body and with your emotions before you have any idea</v>

146
00:05:52.001 --> 00:05:54.100
<v Speaker 1>what it is from the perspective of an object.</v>

147
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.440
<v Speaker 1>When you look at the world and when you think about the world you have do it</v>

148
00:05:57.441 --> 00:05:58.490
<v Speaker 1>from a motivation,</v>

149
00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:59.870
<v Speaker 1>a motivated perspective,</v>

150
00:05:59.871 --> 00:06:02.090
<v Speaker 1>and an emotionally ridden perspective.</v>

151
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.160
<v Speaker 1>You can't even see the world without being gripped by your motivation and</v>

152
00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.130
<v Speaker 1>emotional states.</v>

153
00:06:07.131 --> 00:06:12.131
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea that rationality or perception is somehow separate from or,</v>

154
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.630
<v Speaker 1>or super ordinate to,</v>

155
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.453
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

156
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:18.950
<v Speaker 1>perception and emotion is just wrong.</v>

157
00:06:18.951 --> 00:06:22.910
<v Speaker 1>We understand now that you can't even think without being motivated.</v>

158
00:06:22.911 --> 00:06:24.890
<v Speaker 1>You can't see the world without being motivated.</v>

159
00:06:24.891 --> 00:06:28.550
<v Speaker 1>And that means you always look at the world through a kind of Lens and the Lens</v>

160
00:06:28.551 --> 00:06:32.240
<v Speaker 1>is a narrowing lands and it has to be because the world is so complicated,</v>

161
00:06:32.241 --> 00:06:33.470
<v Speaker 1>you can't see it all at once.</v>

162
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:38.060
<v Speaker 1>You're only seeing tiny slices of it in time and tiny slices of it in space.</v>

163
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.460
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

164
00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:42.500
<v Speaker 1>and even then you have to narrow it to only those things that are relevant to</v>

165
00:06:42.501 --> 00:06:43.400
<v Speaker 1>you at that moment.</v>

166
00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.320
<v Speaker 1>And we don't know exactly how you do that.</v>

167
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:50.470
<v Speaker 1>We know that it takes years and years of perceptual work in infancy say so that</v>

168
00:06:51.651 --> 00:06:55.280
<v Speaker 1>you managed to build up an object conception of the world.</v>

169
00:06:55.281 --> 00:06:58.640
<v Speaker 1>That's probably all you're doing in the first two or three years of life.</v>

170
00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.900
<v Speaker 1>And you're doing it constantly and it's just as complicated as learning language</v>

171
00:07:02.901 --> 00:07:04.400
<v Speaker 1>say are even more complicated.</v>

172
00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:08.000
<v Speaker 1>Most of it's invisible and we don't know how children do that.</v>

173
00:07:08.001 --> 00:07:09.260
<v Speaker 1>And by the time they can talk,</v>

174
00:07:09.261 --> 00:07:10.041
<v Speaker 1>they've already done it.</v>

175
00:07:10.041 --> 00:07:12.680
<v Speaker 1>So they can't even tell us what they're doing.</v>

176
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.290
<v Speaker 1>It takes a long time to build up an object world.</v>

177
00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.300
<v Speaker 1>And when you look at the world,</v>

178
00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:19.220
<v Speaker 1>when you go from point a to point B,</v>

179
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:22.520
<v Speaker 1>even when you're doing something as simple as looking for food and in the</v>

180
00:07:22.521 --> 00:07:27.521
<v Speaker 1>kitchen you ignore everything about the world that isn't relevant to making</v>

181
00:07:27.681 --> 00:07:29.060
<v Speaker 1>yourself a peanut butter sandwich.</v>

182
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:32.090
<v Speaker 1>And you focus in on those few things that are the refrigerator,</v>

183
00:07:32.091 --> 00:07:33.050
<v Speaker 1>the food,</v>

184
00:07:33.051 --> 00:07:33.531
<v Speaker 1>the knives,</v>

185
00:07:33.531 --> 00:07:34.640
<v Speaker 1>the cutlery and so on.</v>

186
00:07:34.641 --> 00:07:39.560
<v Speaker 1>And everything else is screened out and you can't help but look at the world</v>

187
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.510
<v Speaker 1>through that kind of lance and the Lens is change.</v>

188
00:07:42.511 --> 00:07:46.370
<v Speaker 1>And you can be in different motivational states and they can change because of</v>

189
00:07:46.371 --> 00:07:47.660
<v Speaker 1>internal transformations.</v>

190
00:07:47.661 --> 00:07:48.800
<v Speaker 1>You're not hungry,</v>

191
00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:50.300
<v Speaker 1>you're thirsty or you're not thirsty.</v>

192
00:07:50.301 --> 00:07:53.360
<v Speaker 1>You're interested in someone or somebody who's telling you a story.</v>

193
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:57.440
<v Speaker 1>And then you adopt their motivational framework and you can see the world</v>

194
00:07:57.441 --> 00:07:58.071
<v Speaker 1>through their eyes.</v>

195
00:07:58.071 --> 00:08:00.030
<v Speaker 1>And now we know what the neural machinery for that,</v>

196
00:08:00.031 --> 00:08:03.740
<v Speaker 1>and we already talked about that so we can toss back and forth these</v>

197
00:08:03.741 --> 00:08:04.760
<v Speaker 1>motivational rains,</v>

198
00:08:04.761 --> 00:08:08.420
<v Speaker 1>it frames of reference and that gives us insight into someone else's world.</v>

199
00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:13.280
<v Speaker 1>You can look at the world endless numbers of ways and what you're trying to do</v>

200
00:08:13.281 --> 00:08:16.310
<v Speaker 1>is out of its infinite richness,</v>

201
00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:17.420
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

202
00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:21.200
<v Speaker 1>is to pull out parts of it that are useful for you while you're moving from</v>

203
00:08:21.201 --> 00:08:22.250
<v Speaker 1>point a to point B.</v>

204
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:24.980
<v Speaker 1>And this can be a chair if you want to sit down,</v>

205
00:08:24.981 --> 00:08:26.830
<v Speaker 1>but if you want to take the light bulb out of the ceiling,</v>

206
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.030
<v Speaker 1>then it's then it's a stool or a table.</v>

207
00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:33.950
<v Speaker 1>And whether or not it's a chair or a stool or a table depends just as much on</v>

208
00:08:33.951 --> 00:08:37.250
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing as it does on what it is.</v>
