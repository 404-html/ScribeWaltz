1
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.260
<v Speaker 1>What moment triggered your obsession with the topics outlined in the biblical</v>

2
00:00:13.261 --> 00:00:14.610
<v Speaker 1>series and maps?</v>

3
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:16.583
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.090
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>

5
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.150
<v Speaker 1>I actually don't know the answer that I wouldn't say it was a moment.</v>

6
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.370
<v Speaker 1>I know that from the time I was about 16 till the time that I was 24,</v>

7
00:00:26.371 --> 00:00:29.370
<v Speaker 1>so I had recurrent nightmares about nuclear war.</v>

8
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.620
<v Speaker 1>And so that was certainly part of it.</v>

9
00:00:31.621 --> 00:00:34.170
<v Speaker 1>And they were very vivid and very realistic.</v>

10
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.513
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

11
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.930
<v Speaker 1>and certainly my reading especially about the Holocaust,</v>

12
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

13
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.860
<v Speaker 1>also and then later Solzhenitsyn's accounts of the Gulag archipelago for</v>

14
00:00:46.561 --> 00:00:47.060
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

15
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.850
<v Speaker 1>the horrors there that was also a major contributor.</v>

16
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:52.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

17
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.060
<v Speaker 1>it was my concern about the Cold War.</v>

18
00:00:54.061 --> 00:00:57.960
<v Speaker 1>I would say that was really the trigger in general because I wanted to</v>

19
00:00:57.961 --> 00:00:58.561
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>

20
00:00:58.561 --> 00:00:58.691
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

21
00:00:58.691 --> 00:01:01.680
<v Speaker 1>I took a political science degree first and looked at it from a political</v>

22
00:01:01.681 --> 00:01:02.311
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

23
00:01:02.311 --> 00:01:06.420
<v Speaker 1>But most of my professors by the time I was in my third or fourth year,</v>

24
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.090
<v Speaker 1>insisted that the reason that people fought,</v>

25
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.770
<v Speaker 1>the reasons that people thought were economics.</v>

26
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.980
<v Speaker 1>And I never did believe that because,</v>

27
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.000
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

28
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.950
<v Speaker 1>people fight about the things they value,</v>

29
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.110
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't obvious like why people value the things they value,</v>

30
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.681
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

31
00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:27.000
<v Speaker 1>so it's a psychological issue as far as I'm concerned with and know on an</v>

32
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:28.020
<v Speaker 1>economic issue.</v>

33
00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:31.860
<v Speaker 1>And so it was my discomfort,</v>

34
00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:35.530
<v Speaker 1>dissatisfaction with the standard political science viewpoint directed omic team</v>

35
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.150
<v Speaker 1>point combined with this strange obsession I had about the Cold War.</v>

36
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.810
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's associated to some degree with my proclivity to depression.</v>

37
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.441
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

38
00:01:43.441 --> 00:01:44.041
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>

39
00:01:44.041 --> 00:01:44.874
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

40
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

41
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

42
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.820
<v Speaker 1>I was obsessed with it and I,</v>

43
00:01:47.821 --> 00:01:51.360
<v Speaker 1>it isn't obvious why things grip you and shake you like a rat,</v>

44
00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:52.194
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

45
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.770
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

46
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.490
<v Speaker 1>I guess there's something about that that seems to be associated with what</v>

47
00:01:56.491 --> 00:01:57.900
<v Speaker 1>people used to call destiny.</v>

48
00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.213
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

49
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.433
<v Speaker 2>mmm.</v>

50
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.720
<v Speaker 1>But it certainly wasn't an obsession when I was 23 or 24 when I started writing</v>

51
00:02:05.721 --> 00:02:06.554
<v Speaker 1>maps of meaning.</v>

52
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.120
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about it 16 hours a day,</v>

53
00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.220
<v Speaker 1>like top speed,</v>

54
00:02:10.221 --> 00:02:11.270
<v Speaker 1>just nonstop.</v>

55
00:02:11.271 --> 00:02:13.550
<v Speaker 1>And the only relief I could get from it,</v>

56
00:02:13.551 --> 00:02:13.791
<v Speaker 1>Ruby,</v>

57
00:02:13.791 --> 00:02:15.980
<v Speaker 1>was to go work out with weights,</v>

58
00:02:15.981 --> 00:02:17.510
<v Speaker 1>which I did for quite a long time.</v>

59
00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.400
<v Speaker 1>And gained about 35 pounds in about a year and a half working out with weights.</v>

60
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.570
<v Speaker 1>I had to quit because I was eating so much.</v>

61
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.280
<v Speaker 1>It was taking up like half my life.</v>

62
00:02:25.281 --> 00:02:26.114
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

63
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.133
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

64
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.800
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>

65
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it was,</v>

66
00:02:28.821 --> 00:02:29.654
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

67
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.971
<v Speaker 1>who knows,</v>

68
00:02:31.971 --> 00:02:32.804
<v Speaker 1>who knows what,</v>

69
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.450
<v Speaker 1>what darkness lurks in the bottom of a soul.</v>

70
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:36.051
<v Speaker 1>No one,</v>

71
00:02:36.051 --> 00:02:36.950
<v Speaker 1>why it's there.</v>

72
00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:38.463
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

73
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.410
<v Speaker 1>maybe it was also the fact that I could see in myself the tendencies that might</v>

74
00:02:42.411 --> 00:02:44.090
<v Speaker 1>lead people to do terrible things.</v>

75
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:45.410
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

76
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:46.550
<v Speaker 1>and I was also very,</v>

77
00:02:46.551 --> 00:02:47.780
<v Speaker 1>very curious about that.</v>

78
00:02:47.781 --> 00:02:51.380
<v Speaker 1>So maybe that was an encounter with the union shadow or something like that.</v>

79
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.150
<v Speaker 1>Jeremy Whole Shelf says,</v>

80
00:02:53.151 --> 00:02:54.530
<v Speaker 1>will you lecture in the Netherlands?</v>

81
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.891
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

82
00:02:54.891 --> 00:02:55.701
<v Speaker 1>As a matter of fact,</v>

83
00:02:55.701 --> 00:02:59.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm coming to the Netherlands in January to lecture there.</v>

84
00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.750
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

85
00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.440
<v Speaker 1>I'll put the link to that up on my website at some point in the relatively near</v>

86
00:03:03.441 --> 00:03:04.274
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

87
00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.850
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
