1
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:07.123
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.300
<v Speaker 2>How do you reconcile studies to chill genetic superseding environment in life</v>

3
00:00:12.301 --> 00:00:15.480
<v Speaker 2>outcomes with your own experience conducting successful psychotherapy?</v>

4
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.420
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

5
00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:17.253
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

6
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.330
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

7
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.280
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you one thing man did,</v>

8
00:00:20.281 --> 00:00:25.281
<v Speaker 2>I really did come to realize more and more in the last three or four years,</v>

9
00:00:25.411 --> 00:00:28.530
<v Speaker 2>partly I would say from dealing with my own health problems to some degree,</v>

10
00:00:28.531 --> 00:00:32.430
<v Speaker 2>but also watching the health problems that my daughter had.</v>

11
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:33.693
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

12
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.030
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of what we think of as mental illness is physical illness.</v>

13
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.760
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot more than we think even,</v>

14
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.043
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

15
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.810
<v Speaker 2>and I think that that is reflected in the genetic studies.</v>

16
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.093
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

17
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.260
<v Speaker 2>but I also think I also still think that that doesn't eliminate the role of</v>

18
00:00:54.301 --> 00:00:55.134
<v Speaker 2>learning.</v>

19
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.060
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

20
00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.893
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

21
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.200
<v Speaker 2>people obviously learn and they can learn better or worse and they learn better</v>

22
00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:05.100
<v Speaker 2>when they voluntary voluntarily approach things that are frightening and</v>

23
00:01:05.101 --> 00:01:06.870
<v Speaker 2>threatening and they challenged themselves.</v>

24
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.093
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

25
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.383
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

26
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.610
<v Speaker 2>it's made me more humble,</v>

27
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.140
<v Speaker 2>I would say in some sense,</v>

28
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.210
<v Speaker 2>both as a person and as a psychotherapist because I'm more attuned to the fact</v>

29
00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:22.680
<v Speaker 2>that the apparently psychological difficulties that my clients might be</v>

30
00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:23.401
<v Speaker 2>experiencing,</v>

31
00:01:23.401 --> 00:01:27.480
<v Speaker 2>maybe a consequence of an underlying destabilization of physical health.</v>

32
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm really unwilling to discount that.</v>

33
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.480
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

34
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.150
<v Speaker 2>even if what they're experiencing is very idiosyncratic.</v>

35
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.360
<v Speaker 2>But it still seems to me that there is credible evidence that exposure to,</v>

36
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.810
<v Speaker 2>to what you would rather avoid is curative.</v>

37
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.050
<v Speaker 2>And so is the weaving together of a coherent and a coherent map or narrative of</v>

38
00:01:49.861 --> 00:01:50.820
<v Speaker 2>your experience.</v>

39
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.830
<v Speaker 2>I believe that those doctrines are solid.</v>

40
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.113
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

41
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.650
<v Speaker 2>and that's what psychotherapists do.</v>

42
00:01:55.651 --> 00:01:56.310
<v Speaker 2>Essentially,</v>

43
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.700
<v Speaker 2>they help you get your story straight about your past and your present and your</v>

44
00:01:59.701 --> 00:02:00.091
<v Speaker 2>future.</v>

45
00:02:00.091 --> 00:02:02.310
<v Speaker 2>They help you establish your point in life.</v>

46
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.580
<v Speaker 2>They help you lay out a map so that you can negotiate through the territory of</v>

47
00:02:07.921 --> 00:02:08.371
<v Speaker 2>your life,</v>

48
00:02:08.371 --> 00:02:08.761
<v Speaker 2>past,</v>

49
00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:09.151
<v Speaker 2>present,</v>

50
00:02:09.151 --> 00:02:09.661
<v Speaker 2>and future.</v>

51
00:02:09.661 --> 00:02:12.150
<v Speaker 2>And they help you develop strategies to deal with,</v>

52
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.890
<v Speaker 2>to help deal with emergent complexity and the fear that goes along with it.</v>

53
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.173
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

54
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.873
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

55
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.600
<v Speaker 2>Michael Tom Rose House a very hard question.</v>

56
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.820
<v Speaker 2>Please comment on young Paulie's.</v>

57
00:02:43.821 --> 00:02:44.990
<v Speaker 2>That's Wolfgang Paulie's.</v>

58
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.501
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>

59
00:02:45.501 --> 00:02:46.760
<v Speaker 2>Mundus hypothesis,</v>

60
00:02:46.761 --> 00:02:48.830
<v Speaker 2>one world hypothesis essentially.</v>

61
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.903
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>

62
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:13.481
<v Speaker 2>so Michael,</v>

63
00:03:13.481 --> 00:03:14.350
<v Speaker 2>Tom Bros ass,</v>

64
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:15.160
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

65
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.290
<v Speaker 2>I got frozen there again momentarily.</v>

66
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.040
<v Speaker 2>Please comment on Yom Paulie's [inaudible] Mundus hypothesis.</v>

67
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.370
<v Speaker 2>Does this correlate with quantum theory solutions to the hard problem?</v>

68
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.540
<v Speaker 2>Eg Penn Rose Hameroff or church or or c h o r I don't know what orange or is.</v>

69
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.500
<v Speaker 2>I know Penrose and Hameroff,</v>

70
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm not an admirer of the pen Penrose and Hameroff,</v>

71
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:36.483
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

72
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.770
<v Speaker 2>attempt to reduce consciousness to,</v>

73
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.090
<v Speaker 2>to um,</v>

74
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.620
<v Speaker 2>microtubule function,</v>

75
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.990
<v Speaker 2>quantum mechanics and microtubule function.</v>

76
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.790
<v Speaker 2>I did my best to understand it.</v>

77
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.691
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't,</v>

78
00:03:46.691 --> 00:03:47.920
<v Speaker 2>it seemed hollow to me.</v>

79
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.420
<v Speaker 2>My experience has generally been if I find something in comprehensible and</v>

80
00:03:52.421 --> 00:03:52.811
<v Speaker 2>hollow,</v>

81
00:03:52.811 --> 00:03:53.980
<v Speaker 2>it generally is.</v>

82
00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.940
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

83
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.010
<v Speaker 2>I've read better books on consciousness,</v>

84
00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.730
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

85
00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:58.810
<v Speaker 2>like the user illusion,</v>

86
00:03:58.811 --> 00:03:59.680
<v Speaker 2>which I really liked.</v>

87
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:01.240
<v Speaker 2>That's the user illusion by the way.</v>

88
00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:03.730
<v Speaker 2>And Jeffrey Gray wrote a good book on consciousness as well.</v>

89
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.973
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

90
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.100
<v Speaker 2>the only Paulie,</v>

91
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to be able to answer this question very well cause I'm starting to</v>

92
00:04:08.501 --> 00:04:09.640
<v Speaker 2>get a bit worn out here.</v>

93
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.003
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

94
00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.300
<v Speaker 2>Wolfgang Pauli and young recognized that,</v>

95
00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:18.201
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

96
00:04:18.201 --> 00:04:19.820
<v Speaker 2>this is really a complicated problem.</v>

97
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I can,</v>

98
00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I can answer this.</v>

99
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.811
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

100
00:04:26.811 --> 00:04:27.800
<v Speaker 2>let's try this.</v>

101
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:29.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

102
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.511
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

103
00:04:29.511 --> 00:04:32.180
<v Speaker 2>it's been years since I've thought about this and wrote about it,</v>

104
00:04:32.181 --> 00:04:33.380
<v Speaker 2>so we'll see how I can do.</v>

105
00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.410
<v Speaker 1>Mm.</v>

106
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.240
<v Speaker 2>You can think about this from a perspective of Piaget and Constructivism,</v>

107
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.630
<v Speaker 2>so imagine that what you confront.</v>

108
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

109
00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.520
<v Speaker 2>What you confront fundamentally in the world is what is unknowable and what is</v>

110
00:04:55.681 --> 00:04:58.020
<v Speaker 2>an unknowable has an intrinsic meaning.</v>

111
00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.600
<v Speaker 2>It's both frightening and compelling.</v>

112
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:01.860
<v Speaker 2>Simultaneously,</v>

113
00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:07.190
<v Speaker 2>it activates Predator detection systems that protect you in the way that a prey</v>

114
00:05:09.021 --> 00:05:12.650
<v Speaker 2>animal is protected by freezing and withdrawal and that sort of thing.</v>

115
00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.690
<v Speaker 2>But it also makes you curious so that which you do not understand,</v>

116
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:22.610
<v Speaker 2>which is something that you can conceptualize as that which has not yet been</v>

117
00:05:22.611 --> 00:05:23.001
<v Speaker 2>made.</v>

118
00:05:23.001 --> 00:05:25.940
<v Speaker 2>Habitable world has an intrinsic meaning.</v>

119
00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

120
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.340
<v Speaker 2>Now the question is whether the fundamental stuff of the world is that</v>

121
00:05:33.341 --> 00:05:36.700
<v Speaker 2>meaningful unknown or something material.</v>

122
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.970
<v Speaker 2>You can make the case that what we recognize as material is actually a pragmatic</v>

123
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:51.420
<v Speaker 2>reconceptualization of the meaning of the ambivalent meaning of the unknowable.</v>

124
00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.470
<v Speaker 2>Now I know that that's hard.</v>

125
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.640
<v Speaker 2>That's a hard concept,</v>

126
00:05:58.641 --> 00:06:03.230
<v Speaker 2>but imagine you see it depends on whether or not you believe that our</v>

127
00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:07.820
<v Speaker 2>descriptions of material reality are the superordinate</v>

128
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.400
<v Speaker 2>descriptions of reality or whether our conceptualization of material is actually</v>

129
00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.930
<v Speaker 2>a form of pragmatic tool use that's oriented towards our survival and this is</v>

130
00:06:22.201 --> 00:06:23.520
<v Speaker 2>not an easy thing to sort out.</v>

131
00:06:23.521 --> 00:06:26.280
<v Speaker 2>It's something that I did try to sort out to some degree with Sam,</v>

132
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:27.331
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

133
00:06:27.331 --> 00:06:32.040
<v Speaker 2>is do we have an objective description of reality and his reality,</v>

134
00:06:32.041 --> 00:06:37.041
<v Speaker 2>something that can be objectively described or are we using a technology that</v>

135
00:06:37.441 --> 00:06:42.441
<v Speaker 2>produces so called objective representations to facilitate our tool use?</v>

136
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.460
<v Speaker 2>And it's a hard question,</v>

137
00:06:44.461 --> 00:06:44.671
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

138
00:06:44.671 --> 00:06:47.160
<v Speaker 2>Because obviously our advanced technology,</v>

139
00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:52.140
<v Speaker 2>which we use in a tool like fashion is a consequence of our materialists</v>

140
00:06:52.141 --> 00:06:52.950
<v Speaker 2>science.</v>

141
00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:54.120
<v Speaker 2>Which begs the question,</v>

142
00:06:54.121 --> 00:06:59.121
<v Speaker 2>is the science is the fundamental purpose of the science descriptive or</v>

143
00:06:59.131 --> 00:07:00.030
<v Speaker 2>pragmatic?</v>

144
00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:00.271
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

145
00:07:00.271 --> 00:07:00.871
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

146
00:07:00.871 --> 00:07:04.770
<v Speaker 2>I tend to think it's pragmatic because I think our fundamental problem is a</v>

147
00:07:04.771 --> 00:07:06.030
<v Speaker 2>problem of survival.</v>

148
00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.960
<v Speaker 2>So there's a way of looking at the world where the fundamental reality is the</v>

149
00:07:13.321 --> 00:07:17.460
<v Speaker 2>chaotic potential that gives rise to fear and curiosity.</v>

150
00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.800
<v Speaker 2>And that's how your nervous system responds by the way.</v>

151
00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:22.320
<v Speaker 2>And see that's interesting to me because I would say,</v>

152
00:07:22.321 --> 00:07:22.830
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

153
00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:27.830
<v Speaker 2>it's a truism of evolutionary biology that what your nervous system is adapted</v>

154
00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:31.710
<v Speaker 2>to what you're adapted to as a consequence of your three and a half billion</v>

155
00:07:31.711 --> 00:07:34.080
<v Speaker 2>years of evolution is reality.</v>

156
00:07:34.081 --> 00:07:36.390
<v Speaker 2>And that there's no other real way of defining it.</v>

157
00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:41.810
<v Speaker 2>And so the way your brain construes reality is as if what you're confronting</v>

158
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.980
<v Speaker 2>isn't indeterminant chaotic potential that first generate something like</v>

159
00:07:48.181 --> 00:07:49.020
<v Speaker 2>apprehension,</v>

160
00:07:49.021 --> 00:07:50.820
<v Speaker 2>fear and curiosity.</v>

161
00:07:50.821 --> 00:07:51.654
<v Speaker 2>Secondarily,</v>

162
00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:55.680
<v Speaker 2>the apprehension to freeze you so that you don't get eaten or destroyed and the</v>

163
00:07:55.681 --> 00:08:00.681
<v Speaker 2>curiosity to allow you to engage with what's on known and to transform it into</v>

164
00:08:01.261 --> 00:08:02.340
<v Speaker 2>habitable territory,</v>

165
00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:05.430
<v Speaker 2>which in large part consists of tools.</v>

166
00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:06.301
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

167
00:08:06.301 --> 00:08:11.301
<v Speaker 2>the onus Mundus that Paulie and young talked about seems to me to be associated</v>

168
00:08:13.411 --> 00:08:17.850
<v Speaker 2>with this idea of that chaotic potential.</v>

169
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:22.680
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's related to the physicist wheeler's proposition,</v>

170
00:08:22.681 --> 00:08:27.660
<v Speaker 2>that the fundamental reality of the world is information rather than material.</v>

171
00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.030
<v Speaker 2>That material is a secondary,</v>

172
00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:32.993
<v Speaker 2>what would you call it?</v>

173
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.910
<v Speaker 2>It's a secondary manifestation of information.</v>

174
00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:39.270
<v Speaker 2>And I think that what we confront in the world,</v>

175
00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:39.781
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

176
00:08:39.781 --> 00:08:44.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we're driven by the past and or determined by the present.</v>

177
00:08:44.161 --> 00:08:47.940
<v Speaker 2>I think what we do is we apprehend the potential of the future,</v>

178
00:08:47.941 --> 00:08:49.620
<v Speaker 2>that chaotic potential of the future.</v>

179
00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:50.913
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

180
00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:56.220
<v Speaker 2>and I think that that's associated with a Wa Bohu,</v>

181
00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:01.350
<v Speaker 2>which is the chaotic potential that God confronted with the logos at the</v>

182
00:09:01.351 --> 00:09:02.010
<v Speaker 2>beginning of the,</v>

183
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:03.180
<v Speaker 2>of time in Genesis.</v>

184
00:09:03.181 --> 00:09:06.960
<v Speaker 2>I think the genesis story is a reflection of that fundamental truth.</v>

185
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.290
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that capability characterizes us.</v>

186
00:09:10.291 --> 00:09:15.291
<v Speaker 2>And so the onus Mundus is the informational substrate that constitutes the world</v>

187
00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.410
<v Speaker 2>before it's divided into psyche.</v>

188
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:20.550
<v Speaker 2>So that would be spirit,</v>

189
00:09:20.551 --> 00:09:23.550
<v Speaker 2>that'd be human spirit and consciousness and material.</v>

190
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.470
<v Speaker 2>So there's something underneath that,</v>

191
00:09:25.471 --> 00:09:28.200
<v Speaker 2>and this is what young and Pauline we're driving out in my understanding,</v>

192
00:09:28.201 --> 00:09:33.201
<v Speaker 2>there's something underneath that which is the pre division unity of reality.</v>

193
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.250
<v Speaker 2>And that's something like the Tohu wa Bohu or that tail,</v>

194
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.620
<v Speaker 2>which is etymologically cognate by the way,</v>

195
00:09:40.621 --> 00:09:42.090
<v Speaker 2>with the word Tiamat.</v>

196
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:47.010
<v Speaker 2>And Tiamat is the goddess that the message put Damien Creator,</v>

197
00:09:47.011 --> 00:09:51.600
<v Speaker 2>God Marduk confronted and cut into pieces and made the world from.</v>

198
00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:53.640
<v Speaker 2>So that's all outlined in maps of meaning,</v>

199
00:09:53.641 --> 00:09:57.930
<v Speaker 2>although not so much the onus Mundus hypothesis.</v>

200
00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:58.351
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

201
00:09:58.351 --> 00:10:00.390
<v Speaker 2>and I haven't thought about that for while I wrote about it,</v>

202
00:10:00.391 --> 00:10:02.790
<v Speaker 2>but these were in papers I never published because they were too damn</v>

203
00:10:02.791 --> 00:10:05.940
<v Speaker 2>complicated and I tried to publish them a couple of times for people.</v>

204
00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.193
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

205
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:28.200
<v Speaker 2>But people didn't understand what I was talking about and you know,</v>

206
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:29.280
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't even thought about,</v>

207
00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:30.690
<v Speaker 2>oh man.</v>

208
00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:48.951
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

209
00:10:48.951 --> 00:10:49.784
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

210
00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:50.360
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

211
00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.530
<v Speaker 2>here's a weird thing.</v>

212
00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:22.253
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

213
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:27.550
<v Speaker 2>well the rate at which my camera equipment is crashing seems to be accelerating.</v>

214
00:11:31.161 --> 00:11:35.810
<v Speaker 2>So it appears that discussion of the onus Mundus is,</v>

215
00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:37.560
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

216
00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.870
<v Speaker 2>irritating the structure of reality in some manner.</v>

217
00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:40.441
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

218
00:11:40.441 --> 00:11:41.790
<v Speaker 2>let's get back to it for a minute.</v>

219
00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:45.180
<v Speaker 2>So this is a different way of conceptualizing the world.</v>

220
00:11:45.181 --> 00:11:47.550
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a phenomenological perspective.</v>

221
00:11:47.551 --> 00:11:48.120
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

222
00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.470
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know what to make of it.</v>

223
00:11:49.471 --> 00:11:50.850
<v Speaker 2>So think about it this way,</v>

224
00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:56.540
<v Speaker 2>so it looks like your left hemisphere is specialized for operation in territory</v>

225
00:11:57.161 --> 00:11:58.060
<v Speaker 2>that you understand.</v>

226
00:11:58.061 --> 00:12:03.010
<v Speaker 2>So it's specialized for operation in those places where behavioral patterns have</v>

227
00:12:03.011 --> 00:12:04.900
<v Speaker 2>been made habitual and explicit.</v>

228
00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:10.320
<v Speaker 2>Whereas the right hemisphere is specialized for response to chaos itself to the</v>

229
00:12:10.751 --> 00:12:11.584
<v Speaker 2>unknown.</v>

230
00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:15.700
<v Speaker 2>And what that implies is that the division that's expressed,</v>

231
00:12:15.701 --> 00:12:17.380
<v Speaker 2>for example in the in Yang symbol,</v>

232
00:12:17.381 --> 00:12:22.150
<v Speaker 2>which is essentially chaos and order is actually actually represents something</v>

233
00:12:22.151 --> 00:12:24.100
<v Speaker 2>fundamental about the structure of reality.</v>

234
00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:25.151
<v Speaker 2>Now you might say,</v>

235
00:12:25.151 --> 00:12:25.451
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

236
00:12:25.451 --> 00:12:29.740
<v Speaker 2>only the structure of reality in so far as biological organisms conceptualize</v>

237
00:12:29.741 --> 00:12:29.861
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

238
00:12:29.861 --> 00:12:33.580
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know if we can talk about the structure of reality outside the</v>

239
00:12:33.581 --> 00:12:35.740
<v Speaker 2>conceptions of biological organisms.</v>

240
00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:39.550
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're a strict believer in objective material reality in that</v>

241
00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:42.100
<v Speaker 2>transcendent existence of strict material reality,</v>

242
00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:43.091
<v Speaker 2>then you might say,</v>

243
00:12:43.091 --> 00:12:46.570
<v Speaker 2>well you of course you could talk about it because strict material reality</v>

244
00:12:46.571 --> 00:12:49.360
<v Speaker 2>exists in the absence of biology and consciousness.</v>

245
00:12:49.361 --> 00:12:54.361
<v Speaker 2>But it isn't so obvious to me that material reality does exist in the absence of</v>

246
00:12:55.571 --> 00:12:59.830
<v Speaker 2>consciousness because I can't conceptualize what existence would mean in the</v>

247
00:12:59.831 --> 00:13:01.180
<v Speaker 2>absence of consciousness.</v>

248
00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:02.500
<v Speaker 2>Like is there time?</v>

249
00:13:02.501 --> 00:13:03.460
<v Speaker 2>Is their duration,</v>

250
00:13:03.461 --> 00:13:04.480
<v Speaker 2>is their size,</v>

251
00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:05.070
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

252
00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:06.670
<v Speaker 2>all of these things are relative.</v>

253
00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:07.541
<v Speaker 2>In some sense.</v>

254
00:13:07.541 --> 00:13:11.800
<v Speaker 2>All of these things presuppose a conscious observer even in the materialist</v>

255
00:13:11.801 --> 00:13:12.634
<v Speaker 2>description.</v>

256
00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.330
<v Speaker 2>So it looks to me like what reality is,</v>

257
00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:18.340
<v Speaker 2>is this Eunice Mungus,</v>

258
00:13:18.341 --> 00:13:20.050
<v Speaker 2>that union Paulie we're pointing to,</v>

259
00:13:20.051 --> 00:13:21.820
<v Speaker 2>it's chaotic potential.</v>

260
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.910
<v Speaker 2>Now I also think that we treat each other that way.</v>

261
00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:27.340
<v Speaker 2>So if I'm treating you properly,</v>

262
00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:31.690
<v Speaker 2>then I treat you as if you're a moral agent who's actively engaged in the</v>

263
00:13:31.691 --> 00:13:36.691
<v Speaker 2>transformation of the chaotic potential that manifest itself as the dawning of</v>

264
00:13:37.241 --> 00:13:38.074
<v Speaker 2>the future.</v>

265
00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:39.490
<v Speaker 2>And that attracts your attention.</v>

266
00:13:39.491 --> 00:13:41.970
<v Speaker 2>I treat you as if you're an active moral engage.</v>

267
00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:47.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm active moral agent engaged in making the moral decisions that determine how</v>

268
00:13:47.591 --> 00:13:49.690
<v Speaker 2>that potential is going to manifest itself.</v>

269
00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:51.520
<v Speaker 2>And if I don't treat you that way,</v>

270
00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:53.020
<v Speaker 2>then I'm patronizing.</v>

271
00:13:53.021 --> 00:13:55.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't give you your full,</v>

272
00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't grant you your full stature as an,</v>

273
00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:02.940
<v Speaker 2>as a a sovereign being and I impinge upon your net at your intrinsic value,</v>

274
00:14:04.601 --> 00:14:08.350
<v Speaker 2>the same value that that allows you to claim,</v>

275
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:09.490
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

276
00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:13.540
<v Speaker 2>the existence of natural rights and also the presence I would say of natural</v>

277
00:14:13.541 --> 00:14:14.410
<v Speaker 2>responsibility.</v>

278
00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:19.560
<v Speaker 2>So I treat you as if you're well I would say made in the image of God in the</v>

279
00:14:19.631 --> 00:14:24.631
<v Speaker 2>genesis terminology that you are part of the process that turns the toe who are</v>

280
00:14:25.991 --> 00:14:26.300
<v Speaker 2>bold,</v>

281
00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:31.300
<v Speaker 2>who should I never pronounced properly into habitable order.</v>

282
00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:36.640
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's the onus Mundus and I think that that's reflected in</v>

283
00:14:36.641 --> 00:14:37.960
<v Speaker 2>your neurological structure.</v>

284
00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:41.140
<v Speaker 2>And I think the fact that it's reflected in your neurological structure and in</v>

285
00:14:41.141 --> 00:14:43.570
<v Speaker 2>the neurological structure of animals with this,</v>

286
00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:44.643
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

287
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:49.030
<v Speaker 2>almost universal dual hemisphere neurological structure,</v>

288
00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:52.670
<v Speaker 2>which also by the way is it is something that's necessary even in neural</v>

289
00:14:52.671 --> 00:14:53.504
<v Speaker 2>networks.</v>

290
00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:54.443
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

291
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:58.010
<v Speaker 2>which is where we got the idea for plasticity and stability by the way,</v>

292
00:14:58.011 --> 00:14:58.280
<v Speaker 2>for the,</v>

293
00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.360
<v Speaker 2>in the big five aspects,</v>

294
00:14:59.361 --> 00:15:01.940
<v Speaker 2>scale models and the higher order personality factors.</v>

295
00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:03.173
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

296
00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:08.560
<v Speaker 2>I think the fact that that bifurcation is reflected in neurology is a reflection</v>

297
00:15:09.741 --> 00:15:10.820
<v Speaker 2>of the fact that it's,</v>

298
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:12.860
<v Speaker 2>it exists in reality.</v>

299
00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:13.221
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

300
00:15:13.221 --> 00:15:13.850
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

301
00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:15.920
<v Speaker 2>defining reality is no simple thing.</v>

302
00:15:15.921 --> 00:15:16.754
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

303
00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:17.630
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

304
00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:20.210
<v Speaker 2>you can think about it as an objective materialist,</v>

305
00:15:20.211 --> 00:15:24.950
<v Speaker 2>but you can also think of reality as the sum total of that which is experienced.</v>

306
00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:26.780
<v Speaker 2>And those aren't the same things.</v>

307
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:29.030
<v Speaker 2>They aren't the same fundamental presuppositions.</v>

308
00:15:29.031 --> 00:15:34.031
<v Speaker 2>And I think that we've predicated our society in so far as our society is</v>

309
00:15:34.761 --> 00:15:39.761
<v Speaker 2>functional on the proposition that each individual is a sovereign entity.</v>

310
00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:42.763
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

311
00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:47.360
<v Speaker 2>what would you say characterized by a spark of divinity that uses the</v>

312
00:15:47.361 --> 00:15:48.200
<v Speaker 2>responsible,</v>

313
00:15:48.201 --> 00:15:53.201
<v Speaker 2>truthful word to confront the chaos of potential and generate the habitable</v>

314
00:15:53.871 --> 00:15:54.141
<v Speaker 2>order?</v>

315
00:15:54.141 --> 00:15:54.974
<v Speaker 2>That is good.</v>

316
00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:56.300
<v Speaker 2>I think we act out.</v>
