1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.320
<v Speaker 1>So the question was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2
00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:06.380
<v Speaker 1>positive emotions mediated by dopamine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're advancing towards something,</v>

3
00:00:06.381 --> 00:00:08.060
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or when you have a cue that something</v>

4
00:00:08.061 --> 00:00:11.390
<v Speaker 1>good is about to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the system that mediates</v>

5
00:00:11.391 --> 00:00:13.730
<v Speaker 1>positive emotion at the satiation level?</v>

6
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.800
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

7
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:21.560
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

8
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's start with the satiation issue</v>

9
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.960
<v Speaker 1>that seems most deregulated by</v>
<v Speaker 1>Serotonin.</v>

10
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.160
<v Speaker 1>The opiate issue is there are other</v>
<v Speaker 1>forms of specific reward that don't seem</v>

11
00:00:33.171 --> 00:00:36.920
<v Speaker 1>to be merely motivated or merely</v>
<v Speaker 1>underpinned by dopamine.</v>

12
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.080
<v Speaker 1>And the opiate system would be one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those.</v>

13
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.260
<v Speaker 1>There's an oxytocin system as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are other biochemical systems</v>

14
00:00:45.291 --> 00:00:47.870
<v Speaker 1>that are involved in more specific forms</v>
<v Speaker 1>of reward.</v>

15
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.200
<v Speaker 1>But the thing that's common among</v>
<v Speaker 1>instances that make it appear that</v>

16
00:00:55.341 --> 00:00:57.440
<v Speaker 1>you're moving forward is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dopaminergic element,</v>

17
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.150
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then one of the things that happens</v>

18
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.180
<v Speaker 1>if you're higher in Serotonin because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're more dominant,</v>

19
00:01:05.181 --> 00:01:07.130
<v Speaker 1>is that you're more satiated all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

20
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.150
<v Speaker 1>That's why people who are low in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy with decreased</v>

21
00:01:11.151 --> 00:01:16.151
<v Speaker 1>levels of Serotonin are more impulsive</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also more emotionally dysregulated.</v>

22
00:01:16.851 --> 00:01:18.980
<v Speaker 1>They're more impulsive because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

23
00:01:18.981 --> 00:01:20.870
<v Speaker 1>you take your positive thing when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can get it.</v>

24
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.800
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

25
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.720
<v Speaker 1>And so they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're more dissatisfied.</v>

26
00:01:24.721 --> 00:01:28.650
<v Speaker 1>They're more looking for anything that</v>
<v Speaker 1>will produce a positive outcome.</v>

27
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.260
<v Speaker 1>And then they're also more likely to</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience diffused negative emotion.</v>

28
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.740
<v Speaker 1>Partly because their serotonin systems</v>
<v Speaker 1>are lower,</v>

29
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.490
<v Speaker 1>indicating their tenuous status in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy.</v>

30
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.200
<v Speaker 1>Meaning that everything they do that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>uncertain is far more dangerous.</v>

31
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.670
<v Speaker 1>So this is also why it's very difficult</v>
<v Speaker 1>often when you're trying to treat</v>

32
00:01:51.671 --> 00:01:54.010
<v Speaker 1>someone who's depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you could say there's not much</v>

33
00:01:54.011 --> 00:01:58.660
<v Speaker 1>difference between being depressed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>existing in the biochemical state.</v>

34
00:01:58.661 --> 00:02:01.540
<v Speaker 1>That being at the bottom of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy would produce.</v>

35
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.290
<v Speaker 1>In fact they're the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then the question is,</v>

36
00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:09.760
<v Speaker 1>are you depressed or are you just at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom of a dominance hierarchy?</v>

37
00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.980
<v Speaker 1>Because those are not that like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the symptomatology is very,</v>

38
00:02:14.981 --> 00:02:19.030
<v Speaker 1>very similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the cause and the cure are not the</v>

39
00:02:19.031 --> 00:02:20.590
<v Speaker 1>same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

40
00:02:20.591 --> 00:02:23.320
<v Speaker 1>cause you might be at the bottom of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominant Turkey because you're just,</v>

41
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.540
<v Speaker 1>everything about your life is ruined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

42
00:02:27.541 --> 00:02:29.640
<v Speaker 1>and of course your suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you depressed?</v>

43
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.370
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not exactly.</v>

44
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.880
<v Speaker 1>You just have nowhere to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

45
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.830
<v Speaker 1>other questions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

46
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.450
<v Speaker 2>Pursue Muller.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't produce this residence.</v>

47
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.590
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question is,</v>

48
00:02:51.591 --> 00:02:54.200
<v Speaker 1>why don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do people pursue rewards that don't</v>

49
00:02:54.201 --> 00:02:57.710
<v Speaker 1>produce this resonance?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have a value hierarchy.</v>

50
00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.090
<v Speaker 1>So pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good example.</v>

51
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.640
<v Speaker 1>Those kids that were brought there were</v>
<v Speaker 1>lost.</v>

52
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.430
<v Speaker 1>So they didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't have anywhere to go.</v>

53
00:03:06.431 --> 00:03:11.431
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have an identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they default to local pleasure,</v>

54
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.120
<v Speaker 1>and that's better than none.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although the problem with local</v>

55
00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:18.550
<v Speaker 1>pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wild as the narrative made clearer is</v>

56
00:03:18.551 --> 00:03:22.120
<v Speaker 1>that you better look out if you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>impulsive because it's going to kick</v>

57
00:03:22.121 --> 00:03:24.910
<v Speaker 1>back on your heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason is you're only</v>

58
00:03:24.911 --> 00:03:28.060
<v Speaker 1>considering the immediate timeframe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the problem is,</v>

59
00:03:28.061 --> 00:03:31.070
<v Speaker 1>is that things propagate across all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>timeframes.</v>

60
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.250
<v Speaker 1>And so just because something works</v>
<v Speaker 1>really well,</v>

61
00:03:33.251 --> 00:03:37.990
<v Speaker 1>this second cocaine for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean that it's a tenable</v>

62
00:03:37.991 --> 00:03:42.160
<v Speaker 1>solution to the class of all problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So usually,</v>

63
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.340
<v Speaker 1>often people pursue local pleasure</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's the best they can</v>

64
00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:48.640
<v Speaker 1>imagine.</v>

65
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.880
<v Speaker 1>It's the best they've been taught.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't see another alternative.</v>

66
00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.650
<v Speaker 1>So it could be ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be,</v>

67
00:03:53.651 --> 00:03:56.710
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to adopt the</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility because part of the</v>

68
00:03:56.711 --> 00:04:01.420
<v Speaker 1>problem with working at every level of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hierarchy simultaneously is that</v>

69
00:04:01.421 --> 00:04:02.740
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

70
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.890
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like dancing to a very complex</v>

71
00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:07.120
<v Speaker 1>waltz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

72
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.050
<v Speaker 1>You have to be paying attention to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very large number of things</v>

73
00:04:11.051 --> 00:04:14.470
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously and doing things right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It requires responsibility.</v>

74
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.990
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

75
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.040
<v Speaker 1>it's a pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a weight.</v>

76
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.030
<v Speaker 1>Part of the reason people drink alcohol</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to get rid of their responsibility.</v>

77
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

78
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.230
<v Speaker 1>you hear people drink because they have</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

79
00:04:29.231 --> 00:04:29.801
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

80
00:04:29.801 --> 00:04:30.700
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

81
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.560
<v Speaker 1>Some people drink because they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxious and alcoholics drink because</v>

82
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.710
<v Speaker 1>they're in withdrawal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But young people drink because they're</v>

83
00:04:38.711 --> 00:04:42.010
<v Speaker 1>sick and tired of being responsible</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's annoying.</v>

84
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'll drink enough.</v>

85
00:04:43.571 --> 00:04:46.990
<v Speaker 1>I won't care about the medium to</v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm consequences because alcohol,</v>

86
00:04:46.991 --> 00:04:51.280
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what alcohol does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make you ignorant of the</v>

87
00:04:51.281 --> 00:04:54.790
<v Speaker 1>medium to longterm consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it makes you not care about them.</v>

88
00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.160
<v Speaker 1>And partly it's because it dampens</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety,</v>

89
00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.220
<v Speaker 1>so it dampens anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaves your positive emotion circuits</v>

90
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.290
<v Speaker 1>intact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you can go out there and do</v>

91
00:05:02.291 --> 00:05:03.640
<v Speaker 1>stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fun things.</v>

92
00:05:03.641 --> 00:05:05.260
<v Speaker 1>And that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a party really.</v>

93
00:05:05.261 --> 00:05:07.660
<v Speaker 1>Let's go do stupid fun things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a party.</v>

94
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.220
<v Speaker 1>But the medium to longterm consequences</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

95
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.050
<v Speaker 1>it's risky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean you shouldn't do it,</v>

96
00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.420
<v Speaker 1>but it's risky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

97
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.720
<v Speaker 1>they don't know better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the answer I would say.</v>

98
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.270
<v Speaker 1>So yes.</v>

99
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're talking about responsibility,</v>

100
00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.430
<v Speaker 2>it seems like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>balance of person to a certain frame.</v>

101
00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.540
<v Speaker 1>Now that's why conservatives and</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberals don't get along</v>

102
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.100
<v Speaker 1>because conservatives do bind themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a particular frame and they're</v>

103
00:05:43.101 --> 00:05:46.790
<v Speaker 1>conscientious and low and openness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Liberals say,</v>

104
00:05:46.791 --> 00:05:49.070
<v Speaker 1>doesn't that just bind you to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular frame?</v>

105
00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:50.390
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

106
00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:51.470
<v Speaker 1>that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does.</v>

107
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.470
<v Speaker 1>And that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>

108
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.830
<v Speaker 2>but in terms of being aware of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple levels,</v>

109
00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.560
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes within a frame,</v>

110
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.650
<v Speaker 2>it takes a certain amount of tolerance</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the unbearable present for that to</v>

111
00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.450
<v Speaker 2>reach the edge of that frame,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to force a person to see a different</v>

112
00:06:11.451 --> 00:06:13.250
<v Speaker 2>frame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that's something that sentence.</v>

113
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:14.480
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

114
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:18.000
<v Speaker 1>that's actually where I stopped today</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's a,</v>

115
00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:19.660
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're,</v>

116
00:06:19.661 --> 00:06:21.410
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good because both the questions you</v>

117
00:06:21.411 --> 00:06:23.960
<v Speaker 1>asked indicated that you're sort of at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next step in the,</v>

118
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.840
<v Speaker 1>in the logic process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you asked about the relationship</v>

119
00:06:26.841 --> 00:06:28.170
<v Speaker 1>between these frames with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

120
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in relationship to one another and that</v>

121
00:06:30.501 --> 00:06:31.810
<v Speaker 1>is the next issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like</v>

122
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.820
<v Speaker 2>there's something about responsibility</v>
<v Speaker 2>and individuality,</v>

123
00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:39.500
<v Speaker 2>but I'm curious about responsibility</v>
<v Speaker 2>implies a connection to other people.</v>

124
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:39.800
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

125
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.230
<v Speaker 1>Well what are the things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things we are going to talk</v>

126
00:06:42.231 --> 00:06:46.310
<v Speaker 1>about in the classes is how you address</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem that you just described,</v>

127
00:06:46.311 --> 00:06:49.280
<v Speaker 1>which is that this is the Peter Pan</v>
<v Speaker 1>Story,</v>

128
00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:54.310
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking is Peter Pan is this</v>
<v Speaker 1>magical boy pan means pan is the god of</v>

129
00:06:55.161 --> 00:06:56.780
<v Speaker 1>everything roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

130
00:06:56.781 --> 00:07:01.610
<v Speaker 1>And so it's not an accident that he has</v>
<v Speaker 1>the name Pat and he's the boy that won't</v>

131
00:07:01.611 --> 00:07:04.700
<v Speaker 1>grow up and he's magical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's because children are</v>

132
00:07:04.701 --> 00:07:06.110
<v Speaker 1>magical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can be anything.</v>

133
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:11.270
<v Speaker 1>They're nothing but potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Peter Pan doesn't want to give that</v>

134
00:07:11.271 --> 00:07:12.320
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

135
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:14.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got some adults around them,</v>

136
00:07:14.511 --> 00:07:18.620
<v Speaker 1>but the main adult is captain hook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well who the hell wants to grow up to be</v>

137
00:07:18.621 --> 00:07:19.454
<v Speaker 1>captain?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hark.</v>

138
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.020
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got a hook.</v>

139
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:26.920
<v Speaker 1>Second year a tyrant and third you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>chased by the dragon of chaos with a</v>

140
00:07:27.171 --> 00:07:28.970
<v Speaker 1>clock in its stomach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

141
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:30.860
<v Speaker 1>The crocodile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's already got a piece of view.</v>

142
00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:33.470
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what happens when you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>older.</v>

143
00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.850
<v Speaker 1>Time has already got a piece of you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually it's got a taste for you and</v>

144
00:07:37.851 --> 00:07:42.350
<v Speaker 1>eventually it's going to eat you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so hook is so traumatized by that</v>

145
00:07:42.351 --> 00:07:47.351
<v Speaker 1>that he can't help but be a tyrant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then Peter Pan looks out traumatized</v>

146
00:07:47.781 --> 00:07:48.890
<v Speaker 1>Herc and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>

147
00:07:48.891 --> 00:07:50.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sacrificing my childhood for</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

148
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:53.930
<v Speaker 1>So that's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except he ends up killing in lost boys.</v>

149
00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:56.060
<v Speaker 1>It never loud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

150
00:07:56.061 --> 00:07:59.330
<v Speaker 1>Neverland doesn't exist and who the hell</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to be king of the lost boys?</v>

151
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:03.620
<v Speaker 1>And he also sacrifices the possibility</v>
<v Speaker 1>that to help it real relationship with a</v>

152
00:08:03.621 --> 00:08:06.020
<v Speaker 1>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's Wendy Wright and she's</v>

153
00:08:06.021 --> 00:08:10.670
<v Speaker 1>kind of conservative middle class London</v>
<v Speaker 1>dwelling girl.</v>

154
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:12.680
<v Speaker 1>She wants to grow up and have kids and</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a life.</v>

155
00:08:12.681 --> 00:08:15.830
<v Speaker 1>She accepts her mortality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she accepts her maturity.</v>

156
00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.310
<v Speaker 1>Peter Pan has to contend himself with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tinkerbell.</v>

157
00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.040
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't even exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

158
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:27.320
<v Speaker 1>she's like the fairy of porn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't exist.</v>

159
00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.280
<v Speaker 1>She's the substitute for the real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

160
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:33.200
<v Speaker 1>but the dichotomy that you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

161
00:08:33.201 --> 00:08:37.610
<v Speaker 1>it's very tricky because there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrificial element in maturation,</v>

162
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to sacrifice the pleura</v>

163
00:08:40.701 --> 00:08:45.701
<v Speaker 1>potentiality of childhood for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>actuality of a frame.</v>

164
00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.170
<v Speaker 1>And the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

165
00:08:48.171 --> 00:08:49.280
<v Speaker 1>why would you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

166
00:08:49.281 --> 00:08:51.830
<v Speaker 1>one reason is it happens to you whether</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do it or not,</v>

167
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:54.380
<v Speaker 1>you can either choose your damn</v>
<v Speaker 1>limitation</v>

168
00:08:55.890 --> 00:09:00.890
<v Speaker 1>or you can let it take you unaware when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're 30 or even worse when you're 40</v>

169
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:05.250
<v Speaker 1>and then that is not a happy day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>

170
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.590
<v Speaker 1>I see people like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's more and more common in</v>

171
00:09:07.591 --> 00:09:11.610
<v Speaker 1>our culture because people can put off</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt maturity without suffering and</v>

172
00:09:11.611 --> 00:09:12.570
<v Speaker 1>immediate penalty.</v>

173
00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:15.540
<v Speaker 1>But all that happens is the penalty</v>
<v Speaker 1>accrues.</v>

174
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:17.820
<v Speaker 1>And then when it finally hits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just wallops you.</v>

175
00:09:17.821 --> 00:09:20.400
<v Speaker 1>Because when you're 25 you could be an</v>
<v Speaker 1>idiot.</v>

176
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:24.150
<v Speaker 1>It's no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even when you're out in a job search,</v>

177
00:09:24.151 --> 00:09:24.481
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

178
00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:26.330
<v Speaker 1>you don't have any experience in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're kind of clueless.</v>

179
00:09:26.331 --> 00:09:26.651
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

180
00:09:26.651 --> 00:09:27.420
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're young.</v>

181
00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:28.350
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no problem.</v>

182
00:09:28.351 --> 00:09:30.030
<v Speaker 1>We can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what young people are like,</v>

183
00:09:30.031 --> 00:09:31.680
<v Speaker 1>but they're full of potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

184
00:09:31.681 --> 00:09:35.790
<v Speaker 1>well now you're the same person at 30</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like people aren't so thrilled</v>

185
00:09:35.791 --> 00:09:38.000
<v Speaker 1>about you at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like what the hell have you been</v>

186
00:09:38.001 --> 00:09:39.750
<v Speaker 1>doing for the last 10 years?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

187
00:09:39.751 --> 00:09:42.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm just as clueless as I was when I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>22 it's,</v>

188
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:46.050
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not 22 you're an old infant.</v>

189
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.380
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's an ugly thing and old infant.</v>

190
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.320
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason,</v>

191
00:09:52.321 --> 00:09:57.321
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason you choose your damn</v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice because the sacrifice is</v>

192
00:09:57.691 --> 00:10:00.270
<v Speaker 1>inevitable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least you get to choose it.</v>

193
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:04.110
<v Speaker 1>And then there's something that's even</v>
<v Speaker 1>more complex than that in some sense is</v>

194
00:10:04.111 --> 00:10:09.111
<v Speaker 1>that the problem with being a child is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that all you are is potential and it's</v>

195
00:10:09.211 --> 00:10:12.000
<v Speaker 1>really low resolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could be anything but you're not</v>

196
00:10:12.001 --> 00:10:15.000
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you go and you do adopt an</v>

197
00:10:15.001 --> 00:10:17.370
<v Speaker 1>apprenticeship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

198
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:20.550
<v Speaker 1>and then you become at least you become</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

199
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:23.730
<v Speaker 1>And when you're something that makes the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world opened up to you again.</v>

200
00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.670
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you're a really good plumber,</v>

201
00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:29.430
<v Speaker 1>then you end up being far more than a</v>
<v Speaker 1>plumber,</v>

202
00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:31.080
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You end up being a good employer.</v>

203
00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:32.130
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that plumbers,</v>

204
00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm not putting plumbers town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like more power to plumbers.</v>

205
00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:39.630
<v Speaker 1>They've saved more lives than doctors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So hygiene,</v>

206
00:10:39.631 --> 00:10:41.240
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

207
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:43.650
<v Speaker 1>if you're a really good plumber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then you have some employees,</v>

208
00:10:43.651 --> 00:10:44.610
<v Speaker 1>you run a business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

209
00:10:44.611 --> 00:10:45.650
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make you,</v>

210
00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.210
<v Speaker 1>you train some other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you enlarge their lives.</v>

211
00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:49.800
<v Speaker 1>You're kind of a pillar of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

212
00:10:49.801 --> 00:10:51.190
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have your family.</v>

213
00:10:51.191 --> 00:10:52.320
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

214
00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:56.490
<v Speaker 1>once you pass through that narrow</v>
<v Speaker 1>training period,</v>

215
00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:59.880
<v Speaker 1>which narrows you and constricts you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>develops you at the same time,</v>

216
00:10:59.881 --> 00:11:03.720
<v Speaker 1>then you can come out the other end with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of new possibility at hell at</v>

217
00:11:03.721 --> 00:11:06.000
<v Speaker 1>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you haven't talked about that.</v>

218
00:11:06.001 --> 00:11:11.001
<v Speaker 1>A thought that the proper part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>proper path of development in the last</v>

219
00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:16.640
<v Speaker 1>half of life was to rediscover the child</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you left behind as you were</v>

220
00:11:16.981 --> 00:11:21.060
<v Speaker 1>apprenticing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you get to be something and</v>

221
00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:24.120
<v Speaker 1>regain that potential at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

222
00:11:24.121 --> 00:11:25.470
<v Speaker 1>very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While he was very,</v>

223
00:11:25.471 --> 00:11:28.080
<v Speaker 1>very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's very wise,</v>

224
00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:30.480
<v Speaker 1>very wise thing to know.</v>
