1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.570
<v Speaker 1>Okay</v>

2
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.403
<v Speaker 2>for the decree.</v>

3
00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:02.090
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4
00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.541
<v Speaker 1>Why does it,</v>

5
00:00:02.541 --> 00:00:03.740
<v Speaker 1>why do you care about the degree?</v>

6
00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.353
<v Speaker 1>To get a job.</v>

7
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.990
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

8
00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.350
<v Speaker 1>Whose decision was it that you took the degree that you're taking?</v>

9
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.060
<v Speaker 1>Your S.</v>

10
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.540
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

11
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.250
<v Speaker 1>Did your parents have any influence on that?</v>

12
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.600
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

13
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.960
<v Speaker 1>No?</v>

14
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:15.620
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

15
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:16.130
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

16
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:17.210
<v Speaker 1>What job are you after?</v>

17
00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:18.523
<v Speaker 1>Psychology.</v>

18
00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:19.370
<v Speaker 1>Psychology.</v>

19
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:20.080
<v Speaker 1>Clinical?</v>

20
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.510
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

21
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:21.430
<v Speaker 1>Clinical psychologist.</v>

22
00:00:21.431 --> 00:00:24.350
<v Speaker 1>Why do you want to do that again?</v>

23
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.770
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>

24
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to question you till you run out of answers.</v>

25
00:00:27.261 --> 00:00:28.460
<v Speaker 1>You will run out of answers.</v>

26
00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:29.390
<v Speaker 1>So if this is the time,</v>

27
00:00:29.391 --> 00:00:29.811
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

28
00:00:29.811 --> 00:00:30.950
<v Speaker 1>Why do you want to do,</v>

29
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.551
<v Speaker 1>what do you want to do?</v>

30
00:00:31.551 --> 00:00:34.580
<v Speaker 1>Clinical psychology to help people.</v>

31
00:00:34.581 --> 00:00:35.060
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

32
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.480
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

33
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.370
<v Speaker 1>Why is that more important to you than making money?</v>

34
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.350
<v Speaker 2>Because it helps me interact.</v>

35
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.953
<v Speaker 1>How</v>

36
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.290
<v Speaker 2>it sort of makes me happy to see other people get over there,</v>

37
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:49.020
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>

38
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.350
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

39
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.820
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

40
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:50.131
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

41
00:00:50.131 --> 00:00:50.490
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

42
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.790
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

43
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:51.540
<v Speaker 1>Well that's pretty good.</v>

44
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.140
<v Speaker 1>You had lots of answers so sometimes you can run people out of answers with</v>

45
00:00:55.141 --> 00:00:56.160
<v Speaker 1>about three questions,</v>

46
00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.060
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

47
00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.401
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

48
00:00:57.401 --> 00:00:58.234
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

49
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.820
<v Speaker 1>small action perception nested in larger action perception nested in larger</v>

50
00:01:04.951 --> 00:01:07.020
<v Speaker 1>action perception all the way out too.</v>

51
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.681
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

52
00:01:07.681 --> 00:01:08.700
<v Speaker 1>until you run out of answers.</v>

53
00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:09.420
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally,</v>

54
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.050
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

55
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.261
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

56
00:01:10.261 --> 00:01:13.410
<v Speaker 1>and that's where at the edge where you run out of answers,</v>

57
00:01:13.411 --> 00:01:17.700
<v Speaker 1>that's where metaphysics takes over because there's not an irrational domain</v>

58
00:01:17.701 --> 00:01:18.180
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

59
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.010
<v Speaker 1>You're in a metaphysical domain at that point.</v>

60
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.670
<v Speaker 1>And so you have implicit assumptions that you don't even know about that are</v>

61
00:01:23.671 --> 00:01:24.390
<v Speaker 1>working on,</v>

62
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.621
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

63
00:01:24.621 --> 00:01:25.454
<v Speaker 1>on the fringes.</v>

64
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.000
<v Speaker 1>And we'll talk about that a little bit.</v>

65
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:27.241
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

66
00:01:27.241 --> 00:01:28.074
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

67
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.943
<v Speaker 1>so then</v>

68
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.620
<v Speaker 1>we could take a category like,</v>

69
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:33.663
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>

70
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.570
<v Speaker 1>we'll do a micro analysis the same way.</v>

71
00:01:36.571 --> 00:01:39.990
<v Speaker 1>So you're at home and you're a tickling the baby.</v>

72
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.980
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>

73
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:41.850
<v Speaker 1>So we'll note first.</v>

74
00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:43.020
<v Speaker 1>That's not an abstraction,</v>

75
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.741
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

76
00:01:43.741 --> 00:01:46.050
<v Speaker 1>There's an actual baby and you're moving your fingers.</v>

77
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.460
<v Speaker 1>And so that's not just an abstract conceptualization.</v>

78
00:01:50.461 --> 00:01:50.900
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

79
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.860
<v Speaker 1>it's also where your consciousness ends.</v>

80
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.241
<v Speaker 1>You're tickling the baby,</v>

81
00:01:54.241 --> 00:01:55.620
<v Speaker 1>but you don't know how you're doing it.</v>

82
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:56.880
<v Speaker 1>You don't know the musculature,</v>

83
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.090
<v Speaker 1>you don't know how to manipulate the little organs and everything.</v>

84
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.140
<v Speaker 1>You can just do it.</v>

85
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.160
<v Speaker 1>So Bang,</v>

86
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.740
<v Speaker 1>you're out of the perceptual domain at that point.</v>

87
00:02:04.741 --> 00:02:06.900
<v Speaker 1>It grounds out in voluntary action.</v>

88
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.861
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

89
00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:08.820
<v Speaker 1>so you're tickling the baby.</v>

90
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.540
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing when you're tickling the baby while you're making the baby</v>

91
00:02:12.541 --> 00:02:12.931
<v Speaker 1>laugh?</v>

92
00:02:12.931 --> 00:02:13.171
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

93
00:02:13.171 --> 00:02:14.790
<v Speaker 1>that's one way you're playing with the baby.</v>

94
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:15.091
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

95
00:02:15.091 --> 00:02:15.924
<v Speaker 1>So fine.</v>

96
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.120
<v Speaker 1>That's a subset of the activity play with baby and you can play peekaboo with a</v>

97
00:02:21.121 --> 00:02:22.350
<v Speaker 1>baby or you can take tickle the baby,</v>

98
00:02:22.351 --> 00:02:23.310
<v Speaker 1>you can clean the baby.</v>

99
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.800
<v Speaker 1>Those and all of that could be part of playing.</v>

100
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.761
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>

101
00:02:26.761 --> 00:02:26.941
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

102
00:02:26.941 --> 00:02:28.680
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing when you're playing with a baby?</v>

103
00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:29.161
<v Speaker 1>And you'd say,</v>

104
00:02:29.161 --> 00:02:29.341
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

105
00:02:29.341 --> 00:02:32.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking care of my family and fine.</v>

106
00:02:32.011 --> 00:02:32.701
<v Speaker 1>And then you think,</v>

107
00:02:32.701 --> 00:02:33.750
<v Speaker 1>well what?</v>

108
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.790
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing when you're taking care of your family?</v>

109
00:02:35.791 --> 00:02:36.271
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>

110
00:02:36.271 --> 00:02:36.421
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

111
00:02:36.421 --> 00:02:37.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm being a good parent.</v>

112
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:38.940
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>

113
00:02:38.941 --> 00:02:39.091
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

114
00:02:39.091 --> 00:02:40.860
<v Speaker 1>what am I doing when I'm being a good parent?</v>

115
00:02:40.861 --> 00:02:41.251
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>

116
00:02:41.251 --> 00:02:41.431
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

117
00:02:41.431 --> 00:02:42.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm being a good person.</v>

118
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.071
<v Speaker 1>And then you could say,</v>

119
00:02:44.071 --> 00:02:44.191
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

120
00:02:44.191 --> 00:02:45.480
<v Speaker 1>why should you be a good person?</v>

121
00:02:45.481 --> 00:02:46.980
<v Speaker 1>But we won't go any farther than that.</v>

122
00:02:46.981 --> 00:02:47.281
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of,</v>

123
00:02:47.281 --> 00:02:48.780
<v Speaker 1>because you can see that that's sort of the,</v>

124
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.771
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>

125
00:02:49.771 --> 00:02:51.720
<v Speaker 1>that's an ultimate level of abstraction.</v>

126
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.861
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

127
00:02:52.861 --> 00:02:54.210
<v Speaker 1>so you could,</v>

128
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.230
<v Speaker 1>what do you do?</v>

129
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.270
<v Speaker 1>Someone comes up to you and you tickling the baby and you say,</v>

130
00:02:57.271 --> 00:02:57.421
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

131
00:02:57.421 --> 00:02:58.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm being a good person.</v>

132
00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.230
<v Speaker 1>What they,</v>

133
00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.800
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

134
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm being a good person.</v>

135
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.090
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's a bit disjointed.</v>

136
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.400
<v Speaker 1>It isn't what the person would expect as an answer.</v>

137
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.230
<v Speaker 1>They'd expect something more local.</v>

138
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.640
<v Speaker 1>But it's still true.</v>

139
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.940
<v Speaker 1>And so what's interesting is that when you're doing something that's</v>

140
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:18.540
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

141
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.721
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

142
00:03:18.721 --> 00:03:19.770
<v Speaker 1>I would say worthwhile.</v>

143
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.170
<v Speaker 1>That's probably the right way of thinking about it.</v>

144
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.580
<v Speaker 1>You're doing a whole bunch of things simultaneously and you're not really aware</v>

145
00:03:26.581 --> 00:03:27.361
<v Speaker 1>of all those things,</v>

146
00:03:27.361 --> 00:03:28.770
<v Speaker 1>but you are in some sense,</v>

147
00:03:28.771 --> 00:03:29.011
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

148
00:03:29.011 --> 00:03:30.100
<v Speaker 1>because if the purse,</v>

149
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.440
<v Speaker 1>someone might come along and say,</v>

150
00:03:31.441 --> 00:03:34.410
<v Speaker 1>well what kind of idiot tickles a baby like that?</v>

151
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:35.191
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

152
00:03:35.191 --> 00:03:36.870
<v Speaker 1>well what have they said?</v>

153
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.620
<v Speaker 1>Well they've kind of nailed you here down on the micro tickle level,</v>

154
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.030
<v Speaker 1>but they're sort of also,</v>

155
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:43.380
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

156
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.040
<v Speaker 1>taking a pretty good crack at this high level system as well now.</v>

157
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.150
<v Speaker 1>And that's a problem.</v>

158
00:03:48.151 --> 00:03:48.721
<v Speaker 1>So let's say,</v>

159
00:03:48.721 --> 00:03:51.750
<v Speaker 1>well good parent is a subset of being a good person,</v>

160
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.670
<v Speaker 1>but there's all sorts of other baby.</v>

161
00:03:53.671 --> 00:03:55.740
<v Speaker 1>You have to be a good partner.</v>

162
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.480
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you have to be a good daughter.</v>

163
00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:58.620
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you have to be a good,</v>

164
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.330
<v Speaker 1>nice,</v>

165
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.673
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

166
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:02.340
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

167
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.173
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

168
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:08.570
<v Speaker 1>your ability to function as a good person is composed of a very large number of</v>

169
00:04:09.271 --> 00:04:11.250
<v Speaker 1>hierarchically nested subsystems.</v>

170
00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:12.630
<v Speaker 1>And so when the person goes,</v>

171
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.120
<v Speaker 1>only an idiot would take the baby like that.</v>

172
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.890
<v Speaker 1>And they go after that.</v>

173
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:17.611
<v Speaker 1>You might think,</v>

174
00:04:17.611 --> 00:04:17.731
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

175
00:04:17.731 --> 00:04:18.720
<v Speaker 1>how upset you should,</v>

176
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.700
<v Speaker 1>should you get an answer is,</v>

177
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.971
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

178
00:04:20.971 --> 00:04:22.950
<v Speaker 1>how valid do you think their complaint is?</v>

179
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.580
<v Speaker 1>So let's say maybe it only an idiot would tickle a baby like that and you</v>

180
00:04:26.581 --> 00:04:27.750
<v Speaker 1>happened to be that idiot.</v>

181
00:04:27.751 --> 00:04:28.081
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

182
00:04:28.081 --> 00:04:28.261
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

183
00:04:28.261 --> 00:04:29.460
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're not a good person.</v>

184
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.600
<v Speaker 1>And so what does that mean?</v>

185
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.740
<v Speaker 1>It means that the map that consists of all these nested subsystems has now</v>

186
00:04:34.741 --> 00:04:36.630
<v Speaker 1>become unreliable.</v>

187
00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.750
<v Speaker 1>And so how upset are you going to get about that?</v>

188
00:04:39.751 --> 00:04:40.051
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

189
00:04:40.051 --> 00:04:40.291
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

190
00:04:40.291 --> 00:04:43.170
<v Speaker 1>maybe you had a bad day at work and you're kind of hypoglycemic and you had too</v>

191
00:04:43.171 --> 00:04:44.310
<v Speaker 1>much to drink the night before.</v>

192
00:04:44.311 --> 00:04:45.210
<v Speaker 1>And so someone says,</v>

193
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

194
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.160
<v Speaker 1>that's not how you tickle a baby.</v>

195
00:04:47.161 --> 00:04:48.630
<v Speaker 1>You idiot and you cry.</v>

196
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:50.183
<v Speaker 1>Well why?</v>

197
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:51.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

198
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.010
<v Speaker 1>it's a pretty high level blow.</v>

199
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.280
<v Speaker 1>And so it's the sort of thing you want to do if you want to do,</v>

200
00:04:56.281 --> 00:04:57.240
<v Speaker 1>if you want to hurt someone,</v>

201
00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.500
<v Speaker 1>it's not a good way to teach someone because you teach them down at the smallest</v>

202
00:05:01.501 --> 00:05:02.281
<v Speaker 1>possible level.</v>

203
00:05:02.281 --> 00:05:02.671
<v Speaker 1>The micro,</v>

204
00:05:02.671 --> 00:05:02.821
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

205
00:05:02.821 --> 00:05:03.000
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

206
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.680
<v Speaker 1>you don't tickle a baby like that.</v>

207
00:05:04.681 --> 00:05:09.180
<v Speaker 1>He'd tickle the baby like this and you're doing a good job on everything else.</v>

208
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.500
<v Speaker 1>But if you're going to take a baby,</v>

209
00:05:10.501 --> 00:05:11.520
<v Speaker 1>this is how you go about it.</v>

210
00:05:11.521 --> 00:05:12.181
<v Speaker 1>And the person thinks,</v>

211
00:05:12.181 --> 00:05:12.391
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

212
00:05:12.391 --> 00:05:13.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

213
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing a fairly good job,</v>

214
00:05:14.221 --> 00:05:18.240
<v Speaker 1>but I've got this little thing I have to work on and maybe I can manage it.</v>

215
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.820
<v Speaker 1>And so that works and how that works.</v>

216
00:05:20.821 --> 00:05:23.700
<v Speaker 1>And you can have some sympathy for the person at the same time because you might</v>

217
00:05:23.701 --> 00:05:23.881
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

218
00:05:23.881 --> 00:05:24.270
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

219
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.061
<v Speaker 1>I used to take a baby.</v>

220
00:05:25.061 --> 00:05:25.920
<v Speaker 1>He's like an idiot too.</v>

221
00:05:25.921 --> 00:05:26.880
<v Speaker 1>But you know it's,</v>

222
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.680
<v Speaker 1>it's fixable and most of use.</v>

223
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:29.543
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

224
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.920
<v Speaker 1>And that's a nice thing to do when you're arguing with someone.</v>

225
00:05:31.921 --> 00:05:32.191
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

226
00:05:32.191 --> 00:05:33.024
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

227
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.780
<v Speaker 1>here's a bunch of things you're doing right that are related to this that are</v>

228
00:05:38.781 --> 00:05:39.614
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

229
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.980
<v Speaker 1>Here's a small thing that maybe you could alter slightly and it would make me</v>

230
00:05:42.981 --> 00:05:46.010
<v Speaker 1>happy and maybe I'll return the favor at some point and they think,</v>

231
00:05:46.011 --> 00:05:48.500
<v Speaker 1>oh well maybe,</v>

232
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.060
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'll do that maybe.</v>

233
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.380
<v Speaker 1>And then they practice doing it.</v>

234
00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.590
<v Speaker 1>You can give them a pat on the head and then you're both happy about that.</v>

235
00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.240
<v Speaker 1>That really works with people.</v>

236
00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.950
<v Speaker 1>It really works.</v>

237
00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.083
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

238
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.650
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

239
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:01.483
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

240
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.720
<v Speaker 1>what you see is that these high level abstractions,</v>

241
00:06:05.721 --> 00:06:07.670
<v Speaker 1>let's call them ethical abstractions,</v>

242
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.130
<v Speaker 1>are related to actions.</v>

243
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.270
<v Speaker 1>They're related.</v>

244
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.170
<v Speaker 1>And so you can see that relationship from the good person to doing something</v>

245
00:06:15.171 --> 00:06:18.020
<v Speaker 1>like tickle the baby properly and then you can,</v>

246
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:19.910
<v Speaker 1>you can conceptualize it this way,</v>

247
00:06:19.911 --> 00:06:22.730
<v Speaker 1>that you have this massive overarching map,</v>

248
00:06:22.731 --> 00:06:24.770
<v Speaker 1>which is something like the story of your life,</v>

249
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.500
<v Speaker 1>including its extension future.</v>

250
00:06:27.501 --> 00:06:31.880
<v Speaker 1>And then it consists of these subordinate maps which can be broken down all the</v>

251
00:06:31.881 --> 00:06:33.560
<v Speaker 1>way down to the level of actions.</v>

252
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.040
<v Speaker 1>And so then that explains to you to some degree,</v>

253
00:06:37.041 --> 00:06:42.041
<v Speaker 1>how you can do the impossible job of calibrating your emotional response because</v>

254
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:43.130
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

255
00:06:43.131 --> 00:06:47.120
<v Speaker 1>your emotional response should be proportionate to the level that's being</v>

256
00:06:47.121 --> 00:06:48.560
<v Speaker 1>assaulted by the anomaly.</v>
