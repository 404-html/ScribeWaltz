00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.180
<v Speaker 1>Here's a good analogy about government type thing.</v>

2
00:00:09.181 --> 00:00:10.720
<v Speaker 1>So your schools,</v>

3
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.730
<v Speaker 1>there's always bullies and bullies are aggressive kids who aren't really</v>

4
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.400
<v Speaker 1>inclined to play by the rules.</v>

5
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.460
<v Speaker 1>So they're aggressive and they're not very conscientious.</v>

6
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.090
<v Speaker 1>And so they're kind of predatory and they'll prey on other kids if given the</v>

7
00:00:28.431 --> 00:00:29.090
<v Speaker 1>opportunity.</v>

8
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:29.361
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

9
00:00:29.361 --> 00:00:30.530
<v Speaker 1>so how do you stop that?</v>

10
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.771
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

11
00:00:30.771 --> 00:00:33.780
<v Speaker 1>you don't go around feeling sorry for the bullies because that doesn't work and</v>

12
00:00:33.781 --> 00:00:35.060
<v Speaker 1>they don't have low self esteem.</v>

13
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.410
<v Speaker 1>They have high self esteem.</v>

14
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.760
<v Speaker 1>And the way that you deal with always is you have parents or teachers watching</v>

15
00:00:40.761 --> 00:00:41.390
<v Speaker 1>the school yard.</v>

16
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.580
<v Speaker 1>Every time I kid bully someone else,</v>

17
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.473
<v Speaker 1>you stopped them.</v>

18
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.660
<v Speaker 1>Now you don't throw them in a cell for 10 years.</v>

19
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.820
<v Speaker 1>You just stop what they're doing from having the desired outcome.</v>

20
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.470
<v Speaker 1>And then bullying goes away.</v>

21
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.490
<v Speaker 1>Now this has been demonstrated by a guy in Scandinavia called Dan.</v>

22
00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.911
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes,</v>

23
00:00:58.911 --> 00:00:59.540
<v Speaker 1>he's done.</v>

24
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.890
<v Speaker 1>He's reduced bullying in the Scandinavian countries by 50% and the way he's done</v>

25
00:01:03.891 --> 00:01:08.300
<v Speaker 1>that is by ensuring that in school yards,</v>

26
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:09.800
<v Speaker 1>bullies get caught.</v>

27
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.950
<v Speaker 1>Not that they get punished now.</v>

28
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.220
<v Speaker 1>So translate that into political policy.</v>

29
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.180
<v Speaker 1>Concern is always argued that you should be hard on crime.</v>

30
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.430
<v Speaker 1>Criminals crack down on crime.</v>

31
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:23.121
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

32
00:01:23.121 --> 00:01:23.900
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

33
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.520
<v Speaker 1>but their way they do it is by saying,</v>

34
00:01:25.521 --> 00:01:25.731
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

35
00:01:25.731 --> 00:01:27.680
<v Speaker 1>let's have more extensive sentences.</v>

36
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.360
<v Speaker 1>That's the wrong approach.</v>

37
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.930
<v Speaker 1>The right approach is to decrease the probability that the crime will be</v>

38
00:01:32.931 --> 00:01:34.970
<v Speaker 1>successfully undertaken.</v>

39
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.230
<v Speaker 1>So you have to decrease the success rate of the crime rather than increase the</v>

40
00:01:39.231 --> 00:01:40.010
<v Speaker 1>punishment.</v>

41
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.050
<v Speaker 1>And that actually works.</v>

42
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.450
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

43
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.231
<v Speaker 1>so for example,</v>

44
00:01:42.231 --> 00:01:45.140
<v Speaker 1>when they put drug addicts on,</v>

45
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

46
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.581
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

47
00:01:46.581 --> 00:01:51.581
<v Speaker 1>tight observation schedule and have a certain punishment associated with failing</v>

48
00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:54.470
<v Speaker 1>a drug test that the drug users who are on parole,</v>

49
00:01:54.471 --> 00:01:55.304
<v Speaker 1>they stopped,</v>

50
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.820
<v Speaker 1>they stopped using drugs because they know they're,</v>

51
00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:59.720
<v Speaker 1>they're not going get away with it,</v>

52
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:00.613
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>

53
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.310
<v Speaker 1>So part of the role of the government is to ensure that rule breakers do not get</v>

54
00:02:07.521 --> 00:02:08.354
<v Speaker 1>away with it.</v>

55
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:09.920
<v Speaker 1>And that's also part of the role.</v>

56
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:10.790
<v Speaker 1>The citizenry Aa,</v>

57
00:02:10.791 --> 00:02:13.610
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't break rules because if you do,</v>

58
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.510
<v Speaker 1>you contribute to the likelihood that everything will fall apart and be,</v>

59
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.930
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't let other people around you get away with breaking rules.</v>

60
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.470
<v Speaker 1>So that's the role of government.</v>

61
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.760
<v Speaker 1>And that's not all,</v>

62
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:26.810
<v Speaker 1>but that's a big part of it.</v>
