00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:08.880
<v Speaker 1>Let me read you some things.</v>

2
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.160
<v Speaker 1>Rogers rote.</v>

3
00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:16.030
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

4
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:16.850
<v Speaker 1>this is a good one.</v>

5
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.970
<v Speaker 1>This is cause this is his statements.</v>

6
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.890
<v Speaker 1>Here's some of it's axiomatic presuppositions.</v>

7
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.250
<v Speaker 1>So this is what you need to cleave to.</v>

8
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.280
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to engage in the process of Virginia therapy,</v>

9
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.830
<v Speaker 1>you have to want to be independent.</v>

10
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:37.950
<v Speaker 1>Now that's an interesting,</v>

11
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

12
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.560
<v Speaker 1>maybe we can actually have a discussion about this.</v>

13
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.633
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

14
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.110
<v Speaker 1>Freud thought the oedipal complex was universal and what he meant by that,</v>

15
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.750
<v Speaker 1>people usually don't have this discussion,</v>

16
00:00:55.751 --> 00:00:57.640
<v Speaker 1>but we can give it a shot and see how it goes.</v>

17
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.120
<v Speaker 1>What he meant by that was that</v>

18
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.863
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

19
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.280
<v Speaker 1>that's struggling out of the family.</v>

20
00:01:07.281 --> 00:01:08.540
<v Speaker 1>The primary family is very,</v>

21
00:01:08.541 --> 00:01:09.374
<v Speaker 1>very difficult.</v>

22
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.470
<v Speaker 1>So I can give you an example.</v>

23
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.490
<v Speaker 1>So I had another client,</v>

24
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.630
<v Speaker 1>very bright guy,</v>

25
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.990
<v Speaker 1>second generation guy from Middle East.</v>

26
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.393
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

27
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.530
<v Speaker 1>he was headed for a pretty good career.</v>

28
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:23.860
<v Speaker 1>He's a smart guy and he's,</v>

29
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.760
<v Speaker 1>he'd done a load of work to get this career going.</v>

30
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.520
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that position that was difficult to obtain.</v>

31
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.200
<v Speaker 1>You had to move to a different city in order to pursue this career.</v>

32
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.000
<v Speaker 1>And his parents were very upset that he was moving off the street they lived</v>

33
00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:38.834
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>

34
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.651
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

35
00:01:39.651 --> 00:01:40.484
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

36
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.960
<v Speaker 1>from the Western perspective,</v>

37
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.520
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

38
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.040
<v Speaker 1>this is where it gets tricky.</v>

39
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.210
<v Speaker 1>The proper thing to do on behalf of the parents would have been to support him</v>

40
00:01:55.211 --> 00:01:56.560
<v Speaker 1>in his attempts to be,</v>

41
00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.910
<v Speaker 1>to establish himself independently about the parent's perspective was you're</v>

42
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.950
<v Speaker 1>betraying the family by moving away.</v>

43
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.073
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

44
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.610
<v Speaker 1>Now the question is,</v>

45
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

46
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.720
<v Speaker 1>is it reasonable to presume that independence is an absolute value?</v>

47
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.171
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

48
00:02:12.171 --> 00:02:13.520
<v Speaker 1>we're having words about this,</v>

49
00:02:13.521 --> 00:02:14.390
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

50
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.280
<v Speaker 1>Wars have been going on for a long time.</v>

51
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:18.471
<v Speaker 1>For Rogers,</v>

52
00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:20.300
<v Speaker 1>if you didn't value independence,</v>

53
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.850
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't get going in this form of therapy.</v>

54
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.050
<v Speaker 1>Freud thought that all cultures were eatable to one degree or another,</v>

55
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.420
<v Speaker 1>and you thought that wasn't true for northern Europeans.</v>

56
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.730
<v Speaker 1>And that was part of the reason why young and Freud came to a crossroads.</v>

57
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.033
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

58
00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.200
<v Speaker 1>you think about that.</v>

59
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.850
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

60
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:45.780
<v Speaker 1>In any case,</v>

61
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.120
<v Speaker 1>for Roger's only independence value,</v>

62
00:02:48.121 --> 00:02:50.340
<v Speaker 1>individuals were suited for client centered therapy.</v>

63
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.370
<v Speaker 1>Here's more acce.</v>

64
00:02:53.371 --> 00:02:54.204
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

65
00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.283
<v Speaker 1>Honest</v>

66
00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.263
<v Speaker 1>or</v>

67
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.370
<v Speaker 1>you're not.</v>

68
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.320
<v Speaker 1>That's another destination to independence.</v>

69
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.193
<v Speaker 1>Turn point.</v>

70
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:05.763
<v Speaker 1>Good point.</v>

71
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you can be completely consistent with yourself and your family.</v>

72
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.230
<v Speaker 1>Well that,</v>

73
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.450
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

74
00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.980
<v Speaker 1>that's a very useful way of the way.</v>

75
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.830
<v Speaker 1>That's a very useful way of phrasing,</v>

76
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.220
<v Speaker 1>phrasing your question.</v>

77
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.070
<v Speaker 1>That's a very useful way of phrasing the issue.</v>

78
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.070
<v Speaker 1>Can you be,</v>

79
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:25.510
<v Speaker 1>if you're honest,</v>

80
00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:26.890
<v Speaker 1>does that mean you're independent?</v>

81
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.203
<v Speaker 1>It's a good question.</v>

82
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.950
<v Speaker 1>Might mean that because it means that you're at least say again from the rod</v>

83
00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:33.220
<v Speaker 1>next.</v>

84
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.080
<v Speaker 1>Let's take it from the Rogerian perspective.</v>

85
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.920
<v Speaker 1>If you're speaking for yourself now,</v>

86
00:03:38.921 --> 00:03:41.620
<v Speaker 1>that would be yourself in relationship to other people,</v>

87
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:42.940
<v Speaker 1>the integrate itself,</v>

88
00:03:42.941 --> 00:03:43.151
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

89
00:03:43.151 --> 00:03:44.920
<v Speaker 1>Not the kind of instrumentals,</v>

90
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.320
<v Speaker 1>useless self that's wandering around causing trouble.</v>

91
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.180
<v Speaker 1>There's still your,</v>

92
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.120
<v Speaker 1>your unique position that has to be contended with,</v>

93
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:53.170
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

94
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.310
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that you're your own kind of bounded entity with its own destiny</v>

95
00:03:57.311 --> 00:04:01.510
<v Speaker 1>and path and its own particular biological structure.</v>

96
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.650
<v Speaker 1>And it's possible that the way that you define independence is that that</v>

97
00:04:08.021 --> 00:04:10.870
<v Speaker 1>particular need is properly integrated into the collective.</v>

98
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.960
<v Speaker 1>So cats a good,</v>

99
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.740
<v Speaker 1>that's a good issue.</v>
