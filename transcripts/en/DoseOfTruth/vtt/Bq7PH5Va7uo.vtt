1
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.430
<v Speaker 1>So the hypothalamus is is an entity,</v>

2
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.400
<v Speaker 1>it's a group of functionally related entities that are composed of groups of</v>

3
00:00:13.401 --> 00:00:14.790
<v Speaker 1>functionally related entities,</v>

4
00:00:14.791 --> 00:00:19.050
<v Speaker 1>but you know you can't start at the highest level of detail and progress</v>

5
00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:19.561
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>

6
00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:20.790
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to use shortcuts.</v>

7
00:00:20.791 --> 00:00:21.301
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

8
00:00:21.301 --> 00:00:26.301
<v Speaker 1>the hypothalamus isn't a very big brain area but it's an important one and it's</v>

9
00:00:26.341 --> 00:00:30.780
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently sophisticated so that if you take a female cat and that there's an</v>

10
00:00:30.781 --> 00:00:34.740
<v Speaker 1>important reason that it's female and you take out basically it's whole brain,</v>

11
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.510
<v Speaker 1>the limbic system that's responsible for emotions and the whole cortical cap.</v>

12
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.600
<v Speaker 1>So it basically has no brain except for his final chord.</v>

13
00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:43.291
<v Speaker 1>The hypothalamus.</v>

14
00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:47.190
<v Speaker 1>And if you keep it in a relatively closed environment you don't like like a</v>

15
00:00:47.191 --> 00:00:48.024
<v Speaker 1>cage,</v>

16
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.250
<v Speaker 1>it pretty much acts like a normal cat.</v>

17
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.010
<v Speaker 1>It can do all the normal cat things.</v>

18
00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:53.700
<v Speaker 1>It can,</v>

19
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.800
<v Speaker 1>it can engage in defensive aggression,</v>

20
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.233
<v Speaker 1>it can eat,</v>

21
00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:58.583
<v Speaker 1>it can drink,</v>

22
00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.490
<v Speaker 1>it can sleep.</v>

23
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:00.240
<v Speaker 1>It's Co,</v>

24
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.750
<v Speaker 1>it's conscious as you know in so far as you can tell whether or not an animal is</v>

25
00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:04.584
<v Speaker 1>conscious,</v>

26
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.360
<v Speaker 1>it's hyper exploratory,</v>

27
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.260
<v Speaker 1>which is extraordinarily peculiar because last thing you would expect of a cap</v>

28
00:01:11.261 --> 00:01:13.590
<v Speaker 1>with no brain would be to be hyper exploratory.</v>

29
00:01:13.591 --> 00:01:13.801
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

30
00:01:13.801 --> 00:01:18.750
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be insanely curious about everything and that's what that seems to</v>

31
00:01:18.751 --> 00:01:22.950
<v Speaker 1>indicate is that it's psychomotor exploratory system,</v>

32
00:01:22.951 --> 00:01:26.010
<v Speaker 1>which is in fact grounded in the hypothalamus is still active,</v>

33
00:01:26.011 --> 00:01:29.520
<v Speaker 1>but it can't build up the memory representations that would inhibit the</v>

34
00:01:29.521 --> 00:01:34.521
<v Speaker 1>exploratory activity because basically what you're doing when you explore is</v>

35
00:01:34.831 --> 00:01:35.910
<v Speaker 1>you're taking something,</v>

36
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.980
<v Speaker 1>something complex and then your mapping.</v>

37
00:01:37.981 --> 00:01:42.981
<v Speaker 1>It's responses in relationship to the transformations of your body and in so far</v>

38
00:01:43.651 --> 00:01:47.790
<v Speaker 1>as the set of transformations of your body that you're likely to manifest,</v>

39
00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:49.470
<v Speaker 1>say in this place,</v>

40
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.190
<v Speaker 1>have zero motivational relevance,</v>

41
00:01:53.191 --> 00:01:55.830
<v Speaker 1>which is really what you're hoping for most of the time.</v>

42
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.250
<v Speaker 1>Then you build up a representation of the place that's,</v>

43
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.140
<v Speaker 1>that's part of that perceptual motor hierarchy and it shuts off your curiosity</v>

44
00:02:04.141 --> 00:02:07.740
<v Speaker 1>about it and then what you perceive from then on end really is your</v>

45
00:02:07.741 --> 00:02:09.120
<v Speaker 1>representation of the thing.</v>

46
00:02:09.121 --> 00:02:10.500
<v Speaker 1>Rather than the thing itself.</v>

47
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.250
<v Speaker 1>And you're kind of happy about that because it's easier to see what you've</v>

48
00:02:14.251 --> 00:02:17.370
<v Speaker 1>already learned that it is to see that thing itself.</v>

49
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.260
<v Speaker 1>Now things can get re novelized you know,</v>

50
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.470
<v Speaker 1>if someone acts very peculiarly right beside you,</v>

51
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.500
<v Speaker 1>you're like the whole space around you is going to get re novelized very rapidly</v>

52
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.690
<v Speaker 1>and your body would go on alert because of that.</v>

53
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.560
<v Speaker 1>But Mick,</v>

54
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.100
<v Speaker 1>basically what you're doing is learning in order to ignore,</v>

55
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

56
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:37.270
<v Speaker 1>Because you want,</v>

57
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.030
<v Speaker 1>you want to pay attention to everything all the time.</v>

58
00:02:39.031 --> 00:02:40.080
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's,</v>

59
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.490
<v Speaker 1>that's a short path to exhaustion because if everything's relevant than your</v>

60
00:02:44.491 --> 00:02:47.850
<v Speaker 1>body goes on hyper alert and you produce cortisol and you know,</v>

61
00:02:47.851 --> 00:02:49.490
<v Speaker 1>you're ready for anything and there's,</v>

62
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.820
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of exciting.</v>

63
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.220
<v Speaker 1>But as a longterm survival strategy,</v>

64
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.671
<v Speaker 1>it's bad.</v>

65
00:02:53.671 --> 00:02:57.240
<v Speaker 1>What you just don't have the energy to maintain that for any length of time.</v>

66
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.540
<v Speaker 1>So part of the reason the cat is hyper exploratory is because the systems that</v>

67
00:03:01.541 --> 00:03:06.160
<v Speaker 1>mediate exploration are still intact as long as it has a hypothalamus and some</v>

68
00:03:06.161 --> 00:03:10.180
<v Speaker 1>of the rough underlying circuitry that associates that with the motor output</v>

69
00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:11.014
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

70
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.190
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

71
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.140
<v Speaker 1>but I can't remember what it's explored.</v>

72
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.110
<v Speaker 1>So just stays hyper exploratory.</v>

73
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.080
<v Speaker 1>It's also hyper reactive safety cues of aggression.</v>

74
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.290
<v Speaker 1>I would say like a hypothalamic cat is a lot like a two year old,</v>

75
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

76
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.350
<v Speaker 1>and I mean that in the best possible way.</v>

77
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:27.010
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

78
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.600
<v Speaker 1>two year olds are extremely curious.</v>

79
00:03:28.601 --> 00:03:29.680
<v Speaker 1>They're hyper exploratory.</v>

80
00:03:29.681 --> 00:03:30.191
<v Speaker 1>They're very,</v>

81
00:03:30.191 --> 00:03:32.230
<v Speaker 1>very reactive to stimuli.</v>

82
00:03:32.231 --> 00:03:32.620
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

83
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:33.520
<v Speaker 1>they cry easily,</v>

84
00:03:33.521 --> 00:03:34.570
<v Speaker 1>they laugh easily,</v>

85
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:35.740
<v Speaker 1>they run around easily.</v>

86
00:03:35.741 --> 00:03:36.100
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

87
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.840
<v Speaker 1>they get scared easily.</v>

88
00:03:37.841 --> 00:03:38.440
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

89
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

90
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.060
<v Speaker 1>experienced pain easily.</v>

91
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.163
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

92
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.790
<v Speaker 1>and it isn't until they build the higher order structures in the,</v>

93
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.633
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

94
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

95
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.500
<v Speaker 1>perceptual motor hierarchy that that all gets integrated and they're not so</v>

96
00:03:50.501 --> 00:03:53.190
<v Speaker 1>reactive then they're nowhere near as much fun at that point either,</v>

97
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

98
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:54.723
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

99
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:55.451
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

100
00:03:55.451 --> 00:03:57.140
<v Speaker 1>and so the female cat can,</v>

101
00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.150
<v Speaker 1>can regulate its,</v>

102
00:03:58.151 --> 00:04:01.540
<v Speaker 1>its water intake and it can also engage in sexual activity.</v>

103
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.880
<v Speaker 1>Now a male cat can't do that.</v>

104
00:04:03.881 --> 00:04:07.540
<v Speaker 1>It needs more brain than just the hypothalamus because it's more complicated to</v>

105
00:04:07.541 --> 00:04:09.600
<v Speaker 1>sequence male sexual behavior.</v>

106
00:04:09.601 --> 00:04:14.601
<v Speaker 1>So you can tell the difference between a male cat with no court tax,</v>

107
00:04:15.371 --> 00:04:15.811
<v Speaker 1>let's say it,</v>

108
00:04:15.811 --> 00:04:17.500
<v Speaker 1>no limbic system and a female cat,</v>

109
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.120
<v Speaker 1>but pretty much only in that,</v>

110
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.470
<v Speaker 1>in that particularity.</v>

111
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:21.723
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

112
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.923
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

113
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:23.291
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

114
00:04:23.291 --> 00:04:23.711
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

115
00:04:23.711 --> 00:04:25.000
<v Speaker 1>so that's very interesting.</v>

116
00:04:25.001 --> 00:04:25.091
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>

117
00:04:25.091 --> 00:04:25.750
<v Speaker 1>because if you,</v>

118
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.750
<v Speaker 1>if you study neuropsychology and you're taught by clinical neuropsychologist,</v>

119
00:04:31.391 --> 00:04:31.541
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

120
00:04:31.541 --> 00:04:34.750
<v Speaker 1>or even neuropsychologists that have a clinical background,</v>

121
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.370
<v Speaker 1>they're very cortical centric.</v>

122
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:37.061
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

123
00:04:37.061 --> 00:04:37.894
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's,</v>

124
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.400
<v Speaker 1>it's part of your hangover.</v>

125
00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.880
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>

126
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:40.713
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

127
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

128
00:04:41.501 --> 00:04:44.710
<v Speaker 1>since we got unseated from our position at the center of the universe,</v>

129
00:04:44.711 --> 00:04:45.544
<v Speaker 1>we've been,</v>

130
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.941
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

131
00:04:45.941 --> 00:04:49.180
<v Speaker 1>rat rat radically running around trying to figure out what it is that makes us</v>

132
00:04:49.181 --> 00:04:51.040
<v Speaker 1>special in relationship to animals.</v>

133
00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:53.320
<v Speaker 1>And we kind of cottoned onto the idea that,</v>

134
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

135
00:04:53.921 --> 00:04:57.490
<v Speaker 1>we have this big cortical cap and especially the prefrontal Cortex,</v>

136
00:04:57.491 --> 00:04:59.740
<v Speaker 1>and it's very large in relationship to our body,</v>

137
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.221
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

138
00:05:00.221 --> 00:05:01.054
<v Speaker 1>which it is.</v>

139
00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.541
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

140
00:05:01.541 --> 00:05:01.781
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

141
00:05:01.781 --> 00:05:04.060
<v Speaker 1>somehow that distinguishes us from other animals,</v>

142
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.290
<v Speaker 1>which it does.</v>

143
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:06.150
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

144
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.810
<v Speaker 1>but that's also led us into thinking that the most recently evolved parts of the</v>

145
00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:12.670
<v Speaker 1>brain are the most important.</v>

146
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.983
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

147
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.411
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

148
00:05:14.411 --> 00:05:16.360
<v Speaker 1>and in some sense the smartest,</v>

149
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:17.141
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

150
00:05:17.141 --> 00:05:20.890
<v Speaker 1>But there's a real error of presumption there because you might also,</v>

151
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.820
<v Speaker 1>you might think instead that it's those parts of the brain that evolution has</v>

152
00:05:24.821 --> 00:05:28.870
<v Speaker 1>had the longest time to work on that are in fact the smartest,</v>

153
00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:29.680
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

154
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.750
<v Speaker 1>And they do take care of all the heavy lifting.</v>

155
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:31.991
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

156
00:05:31.991 --> 00:05:32.321
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

157
00:05:32.321 --> 00:05:32.621
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

158
00:05:32.621 --> 00:05:33.010
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

159
00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.880
<v Speaker 1>your consciousness isn't entrusted with any of the heavy lifting.</v>

160
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.950
<v Speaker 1>You can fiddle around the edges with it,</v>

161
00:05:38.951 --> 00:05:42.390
<v Speaker 1>but you're not going to be allowed to do anything that's really PR,</v>

162
00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

163
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.070
<v Speaker 1>that's really physiologically profound.</v>

164
00:05:45.071 --> 00:05:49.180
<v Speaker 1>And it's a good thing because you just don't have the intellectual capacity to</v>

165
00:05:49.181 --> 00:05:53.260
<v Speaker 1>manage that kind of ongoing physiological monitoring.</v>

166
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.730
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

167
00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.590
<v Speaker 1>It's like you don't understand your body if you're lucky,</v>

168
00:05:56.591 --> 00:05:59.080
<v Speaker 1>the thing works and you can ignore it roughly speaking,</v>

169
00:05:59.081 --> 00:05:59.710
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

170
00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.150
<v Speaker 1>But if it ever goes wrong,</v>

171
00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.430
<v Speaker 1>good luck trying to figure it out consciously.</v>

172
00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.780
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

173
00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:04.001
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

174
00:06:04.001 --> 00:06:05.200
<v Speaker 1>we're getting somewhere with that,</v>

175
00:06:05.201 --> 00:06:05.771
<v Speaker 1>but it's very,</v>

176
00:06:05.771 --> 00:06:06.760
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to do.</v>
