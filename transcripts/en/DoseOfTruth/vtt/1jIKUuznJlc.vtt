1
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.390
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now tell me how many,</v>

2
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.990
<v Speaker 1>how many members,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to discuss any of this</v>

3
00:00:12.991 --> 00:00:15.750
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how many members of Heterodox</v>

4
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.910
<v Speaker 1>Academy are there now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have 1300 members.</v>

5
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.620
<v Speaker 1>So once we opened up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's originally was just where we</v>

6
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.410
<v Speaker 1>searchers who were studying this</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>

7
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.510
<v Speaker 1>but we had lots of people wanting to</v>
<v Speaker 1>join.</v>

8
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.560
<v Speaker 1>And so we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

9
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.281
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not?</v>

10
00:00:26.281 --> 00:00:27.390
<v Speaker 1>And so we just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

11
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.200
<v Speaker 1>if as long as you're a professor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

12
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.230
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a phd,</v>

13
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.180
<v Speaker 1>you're living more or less the life of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>professor,</v>

14
00:00:33.181 --> 00:00:36.450
<v Speaker 1>you have a university affiliation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we now take adjuncts if they have a</v>

15
00:00:36.451 --> 00:00:37.770
<v Speaker 1>phd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

16
00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:40.560
<v Speaker 1>we take postdocs basically if you're in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guild,</v>

17
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.860
<v Speaker 1>if you're living the life of a professor</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're concerned about the rise of</v>

18
00:00:47.821 --> 00:00:49.080
<v Speaker 1>intimidation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frankly,</v>

19
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.190
<v Speaker 1>if you're concerned that our wonderful</v>
<v Speaker 1>institution I love,</v>

20
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.660
<v Speaker 1>I love being a professor.</v>

21
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.220
<v Speaker 1>I Love Adam and I feel like it's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>just losing public respect,</v>

22
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.040
<v Speaker 1>it's losing its ability to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to function.</v>

23
00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:05.610
<v Speaker 1>It's losing its ability to teach and do</v>
<v Speaker 1>research on politicized topics.</v>

24
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.400
<v Speaker 1>So there were more politicized topics</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

25
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:09.340
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

26
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.670
<v Speaker 1>And there are few in the natural</v>
<v Speaker 1>sciences,</v>

27
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.940
<v Speaker 1>not many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are some of the natural</v>

28
00:01:11.941 --> 00:01:13.410
<v Speaker 1>sciences as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

29
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.530
<v Speaker 1>my point is we're now growing very</v>
<v Speaker 1>rapidly and something I'm very excited</v>

30
00:01:16.531 --> 00:01:20.970
<v Speaker 1>by is since we've started having more</v>
<v Speaker 1>violence on campus with beginning with</v>

31
00:01:20.971 --> 00:01:24.450
<v Speaker 1>birth and Middlebury,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're seeing a pervasive sense among</v>

32
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.590
<v Speaker 1>people on the left that there really is</v>
<v Speaker 1>this problem here that something has to</v>

33
00:01:28.591 --> 00:01:31.260
<v Speaker 1>be done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we are finding much more</v>

34
00:01:31.261 --> 00:01:33.000
<v Speaker 1>acceptance now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

35
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.670
<v Speaker 1>from professors on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I like to think about there's the</v>

36
00:01:35.671 --> 00:01:38.070
<v Speaker 1>liberal left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the great majority,</v>

37
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.930
<v Speaker 1>and there's the illiberal left.</v>

38
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.890
<v Speaker 1>We did a factor analysis of politically</v>
<v Speaker 1>correct beliefs and found exactly that</v>

39
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.710
<v Speaker 1>and that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that the illiberal left was also</v>

40
00:01:46.711 --> 00:01:48.780
<v Speaker 1>high in orderliness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

41
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.370
<v Speaker 1>That's the authoritarian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

42
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.260
<v Speaker 1>Predisposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

43
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.300
<v Speaker 1>And also kind of markedly declined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was also characterized by a market,</v>

44
00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.610
<v Speaker 1>lack of verbal intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

45
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.430
<v Speaker 1>that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>0.4.</v>

46
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:03.421
<v Speaker 1>Well that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

47
00:02:03.421 --> 00:02:04.470
<v Speaker 1>that's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's beautiful.</v>

48
00:02:04.471 --> 00:02:07.980
<v Speaker 1>Because one of the simplest formulations</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard really great formulation from</v>

49
00:02:07.981 --> 00:02:11.010
<v Speaker 1>Mark Lilla.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Mark Lilla wrote this fantastic op</v>

50
00:02:11.011 --> 00:02:13.140
<v Speaker 1>ed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The New York Times week after Trump was</v>

51
00:02:13.141 --> 00:02:16.890
<v Speaker 1>elected saying identity politics is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>really foolish thing to do.</v>

52
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.800
<v Speaker 1>It pushes lots of people over to Trump's</v>
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>

53
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.630
<v Speaker 1>The identity politics as part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

54
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he writes this hotbed and one of his</v>

55
00:02:24.031 --> 00:02:26.670
<v Speaker 1>fellow professors at Columbia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget how she does it,</v>

56
00:02:26.671 --> 00:02:28.770
<v Speaker 1>but she basically says something about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

57
00:02:28.771 --> 00:02:31.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mask with eye holes falls from his</v>

58
00:02:31.111 --> 00:02:31.320
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>

59
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.591
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

60
00:02:31.591 --> 00:02:33.870
<v Speaker 1>he's a Ku Klux Klan members,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

61
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.970
<v Speaker 1>And so Lilla Lilla who isn't humanities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's an intellectual historian.</v>

62
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.690
<v Speaker 1>Lilla has this simple formulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says that's a slur,</v>

63
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.390
<v Speaker 1>not an argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And once they had that simple</v>

64
00:02:45.391 --> 00:02:46.200
<v Speaker 1>formulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I realized,</v>

65
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.750
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's almost all the push back I've</v>

66
00:02:48.751 --> 00:02:51.450
<v Speaker 1>ever gotten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's somehow,</v>

67
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.201
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

68
00:02:52.201 --> 00:02:56.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're winking at Nazis or your comfort</v>

69
00:02:56.071 --> 00:02:57.450
<v Speaker 1>to me over and over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just,</v>

70
00:02:57.451 --> 00:03:01.180
<v Speaker 1>my neighborhood was just posters with</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that intimidation.</v>

71
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.520
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is really key.</v>

72
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.480
<v Speaker 1>We're supposed to be all about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can say anything you want,</v>

73
00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:09.940
<v Speaker 1>you can make any argument you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can support it,</v>

74
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.360
<v Speaker 1>if you can back it with reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is critical thinking and this is</v>

75
00:03:13.361 --> 00:03:14.920
<v Speaker 1>what we're supposed to train our</v>
<v Speaker 1>students to do.</v>

76
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.420
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>

77
00:03:16.421 --> 00:03:18.220
<v Speaker 1>you can say anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can say it.</v>

78
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.930
<v Speaker 1>There's a boundary on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

79
00:03:19.931 --> 00:03:22.780
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less so in the humanities.</v>

80
00:03:22.781 --> 00:03:26.590
<v Speaker 1>But if you're a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things you say have to be vetted by</v>

81
00:03:26.591 --> 00:03:28.720
<v Speaker 1>people who are going to be critical of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

82
00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:29.710
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

83
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.530
<v Speaker 1>so not only do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only [inaudible] there's</v>

84
00:03:32.531 --> 00:03:34.330
<v Speaker 1>accountability built into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

85
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.170
<v Speaker 1>So I didn't mean to say you can say</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want,</v>

86
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.220
<v Speaker 1>this brand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can put forth any idea you</v>

87
00:03:39.221 --> 00:03:40.540
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can back it up.</v>

88
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.500
<v Speaker 1>What we're seeing with anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>politicize is it's not about backing it</v>

89
00:03:44.501 --> 00:03:46.480
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Students are learning rhetorical</v>

90
00:03:46.481 --> 00:03:50.680
<v Speaker 1>techniques to link their enemies to</v>
<v Speaker 1>something racist.</v>

91
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.440
<v Speaker 1>Contemptible some tangible that's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the things that are not only</v>

92
00:03:57.161 --> 00:03:59.830
<v Speaker 1>worthy of being destroyed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that you have a moral duty to</v>

93
00:03:59.831 --> 00:04:00.790
<v Speaker 1>destroy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

94
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.860
<v Speaker 1>So that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's almost like the immune system,</v>

95
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.030
<v Speaker 1>how exactly it works.</v>

96
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.310
<v Speaker 1>But there's some cell that tags Acel as</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

97
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:09.340
<v Speaker 1>enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enemy.</v>

98
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.700
<v Speaker 1>And once that tad was put on the cell</v>
<v Speaker 1>that attracts other,</v>

99
00:04:12.701 --> 00:04:14.120
<v Speaker 1>I forget what kind of cell to</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

100
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.660
<v Speaker 1>And so we should look into this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this metaphor of the immune system,</v>

101
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:17.840
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once they know,</v>

102
00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.910
<v Speaker 1>once you're labeled as a racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>students don't have to read you that.</v>

103
00:04:21.911 --> 00:04:24.800
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter what you actually say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will now be a tap.</v>

104
00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.310
<v Speaker 1>It's also too that once you're labeled</v>
<v Speaker 1>that way,</v>

105
00:04:27.311 --> 00:04:31.120
<v Speaker 1>if someone defends you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the label is contagious.</v>

106
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.110
<v Speaker 1>And it's our dynamic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how we know where in this super</v>

107
00:04:35.111 --> 00:04:38.620
<v Speaker 1>religious territory of witch hunts that</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you stand up for someone,</v>

108
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.840
<v Speaker 1>you are tagged and then you will be</v>
<v Speaker 1>mobbed.</v>

109
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.000
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why there's so much disease</v>

110
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.590
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's why there's so much cowardice</v>

111
00:04:44.591 --> 00:04:47.050
<v Speaker 1>on campus among both students and</v>
<v Speaker 1>faculty.</v>

112
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.160
<v Speaker 1>People are afraid to stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if the majority think that what's</v>

113
00:04:51.161 --> 00:04:53.710
<v Speaker 1>going on is nuts or is unfair.</v>

114
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.280
<v Speaker 1>They're afraid to stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's in part due to social media</v>

115
00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.750
<v Speaker 1>because it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

116
00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:04.060
<v Speaker 1>students today had been raised with</v>
<v Speaker 1>various platforms that make it easy for</v>

117
00:05:04.061 --> 00:05:07.600
<v Speaker 1>people to join in attack someone they</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at who liked what.</v>

118
00:05:07.601 --> 00:05:10.060
<v Speaker 1>So if in that article we just saw on</v>
<v Speaker 1>read,</v>

119
00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a bit of a counterrevolution</v>

120
00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.780
<v Speaker 1>and read the students had to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>together somehow and decide should I</v>

121
00:05:16.781 --> 00:05:18.880
<v Speaker 1>like that post?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about if we all liked it at the same</v>

122
00:05:18.881 --> 00:05:20.260
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we'll get in less trouble.</v>

123
00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:21.400
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

124
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.510
<v Speaker 1>So to what degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's talk about the aims of the</v>

125
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.400
<v Speaker 1>Heterodox Academy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've brought people together who</v>

126
00:05:27.401 --> 00:05:31.780
<v Speaker 1>are in principle interested in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>diversity of opinions and,</v>

127
00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.020
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in what manner is that going to be</v>

128
00:05:35.021 --> 00:05:36.730
<v Speaker 1>utilized to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

129
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.430
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to use the word combat,</v>

130
00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.160
<v Speaker 1>but to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to deal with this emergent problem</v>

131
00:05:42.161 --> 00:05:44.390
<v Speaker 1>of ideological rigidity in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>university.</v>

132
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:45.370
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

133
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.890
<v Speaker 1>two useful concepts here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is the emperor's new clothes.</v>

134
00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.510
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all know that story.</v>

135
00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if most people,</v>

136
00:05:51.581 --> 00:05:54.340
<v Speaker 1>even if everybody sees this is nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the empress walking around with no</v>

137
00:05:54.341 --> 00:05:56.290
<v Speaker 1>clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're afraid to say it until one</v>

138
00:05:56.291 --> 00:05:57.830
<v Speaker 1>person says it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

139
00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.280
<v Speaker 1>and this is also the ash experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody says that that line is the</v>

140
00:06:01.281 --> 00:06:05.990
<v Speaker 1>same as that line is obviously not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If one person says the truth,</v>

141
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.040
<v Speaker 1>then nobody conforms after that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the mere presence of a group of</v>

142
00:06:10.041 --> 00:06:11.510
<v Speaker 1>people who say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

143
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.340
<v Speaker 1>we actually need a diversity of</v>
<v Speaker 1>opinions.</v>

144
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.530
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that on our site we'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>publish things.</v>

145
00:06:15.531 --> 00:06:18.560
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes when professors are mob,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when Bret Weinstein,</v>

146
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:19.491
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was mobbed,</v>

147
00:06:19.491 --> 00:06:21.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I wrote an essay that stood up for</v>

148
00:06:21.141 --> 00:06:21.890
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

149
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.780
<v Speaker 1>we've done that for some of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's happening so fast.</v>

150
00:06:23.781 --> 00:06:24.530
<v Speaker 1>I can't keep up.</v>

151
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:25.850
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got books to write and I,</v>

152
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every week there's some new member was</v>

153
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.680
<v Speaker 1>getting mobbed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we're going to develop a team of</v>

154
00:06:30.681 --> 00:06:32.960
<v Speaker 1>people who will write.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But just knowing that there are people</v>

155
00:06:32.961 --> 00:06:34.560
<v Speaker 1>who will stand up for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

156
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:36.920
<v Speaker 1>knowing that there are people who will</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

157
00:06:36.921 --> 00:06:40.220
<v Speaker 1>wait a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not what we do in the academy.</v>

158
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.380
<v Speaker 1>So that's one thing is we just stand up</v>
<v Speaker 1>for each other too,</v>

159
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:48.400
<v Speaker 1>is we develop products that we think can</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically fix the situation.</v>

160
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.460
<v Speaker 1>So one of our products is called the</v>
<v Speaker 1>campus expression survey.</v>

161
00:06:52.461 --> 00:06:56.360
<v Speaker 1>It's a survey designed to actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>measure who was afraid of speaking up</v>

162
00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.510
<v Speaker 1>about what topics and why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are they afraid of?</v>

163
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.960
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out everyone's afraid of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the students more than the faculty.</v>

164
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.270
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're afraid of mostly to talk about</v>

165
00:07:05.271 --> 00:07:06.710
<v Speaker 1>race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about the administrators?</v>

166
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.070
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's afraid of the students.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're afraid of the students.</v>

167
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.630
<v Speaker 1>So I don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've not sorted them.</v>

168
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.760
<v Speaker 1>I've only surveyed students.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

169
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:15.900
<v Speaker 1>But from what we hear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

170
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:17.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are afraid of,</v>

171
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.390
<v Speaker 1>of the students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

172
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.151
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

173
00:07:21.151 --> 00:07:23.400
<v Speaker 1>that's what your hauling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hauling in its own manner.</v>

174
00:07:23.401 --> 00:07:26.430
<v Speaker 1>Like was that real of leaders?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>

175
00:07:26.431 --> 00:07:29.070
<v Speaker 1>They let those kids come into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>classroom,</v>

176
00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.490
<v Speaker 1>the actual classroom and disrupt a class</v>
<v Speaker 1>on an ongoing basis.</v>

177
00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:35.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes and I couldn't understand that</v>

178
00:07:35.731 --> 00:07:36.564
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

179
00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:41.400
<v Speaker 1>my response to that would be first I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would tell them to leave.</v>

180
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.350
<v Speaker 1>Second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would call campus security.</v>

181
00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.090
<v Speaker 1>Third,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if something wasn't done about it,</v>

182
00:07:45.091 --> 00:07:48.390
<v Speaker 1>I just wouldn't teach the class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't understand like it,</v>

183
00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.690
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that it's also up to</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual professors to draw a line,</v>

184
00:07:51.691 --> 00:07:53.270
<v Speaker 1>which is that if you're being</v>
<v Speaker 1>intimidated,</v>

185
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:55.650
<v Speaker 1>dated by students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you,</v>

186
00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:57.720
<v Speaker 1>why do you show up and teach the class?</v>

187
00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:58.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

188
00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:03.570
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are afraid to stand up if it</v>

189
00:08:03.571 --> 00:08:05.310
<v Speaker 1>means that people will call you a</v>
<v Speaker 1>racist,</v>

190
00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:06.830
<v Speaker 1>Cabot God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

191
00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:10.730
<v Speaker 1>it's weird and that situation though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's carried to third to go to</v>

192
00:08:10.731 --> 00:08:12.110
<v Speaker 1>your class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

193
00:08:12.111 --> 00:08:14.350
<v Speaker 1>and there's a much more proximal thread</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

194
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:17.510
<v Speaker 1>That's what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I'm most alarmed by is the rise of</v>

195
00:08:17.511 --> 00:08:20.540
<v Speaker 1>intimidation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Intimidation is now a factor in many</v>

196
00:08:20.541 --> 00:08:22.550
<v Speaker 1>aspects of academic life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's just terrible.</v>

197
00:08:22.551 --> 00:08:26.270
<v Speaker 1>That's completely incompatible with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with what we do and who we are.</v>

198
00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:27.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's especially,</v>

199
00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:30.750
<v Speaker 1>it's especially appalling given that</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever happens in the university</v>

200
00:08:30.751 --> 00:08:31.460
<v Speaker 1>campuses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

201
00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:33.960
<v Speaker 1>like one of the questions I've faced in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada as well,</v>

202
00:08:33.961 --> 00:08:37.030
<v Speaker 1>why should we care about what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening in the,</v>

203
00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.170
<v Speaker 1>in the Ivy Tower is going to hire these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people next year.</v>

204
00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:40.731
<v Speaker 1>You are?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

205
00:08:40.731 --> 00:08:43.820
<v Speaker 1>Well it's the heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what's happening in the campuses is</v>

206
00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:45.510
<v Speaker 1>going to happen in society in five</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

207
00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:47.180
<v Speaker 1>It's already hot goats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's already happening.</v>

208
00:08:47.181 --> 00:08:48.800
<v Speaker 1>So this is actually an important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

209
00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:50.240
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just gave a talk at a,</v>

210
00:08:50.241 --> 00:08:53.830
<v Speaker 1>at a big law firm here in New York where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very devoted to diversity,</v>

211
00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.070
<v Speaker 1>but they're doing it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're really about diversity.</v>

212
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.260
<v Speaker 1>Why is diversity good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they have a whole month on</v>

213
00:08:58.261 --> 00:09:00.180
<v Speaker 1>viewpoint diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is just fantastic.</v>

214
00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:04.350
<v Speaker 1>And what I'm learning from talking to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>number of people in the business world</v>

215
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:08.520
<v Speaker 1>is that in the last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're now all these pressures on</v>

216
00:09:08.521 --> 00:09:13.521
<v Speaker 1>leaders to endorse this condemned that</v>
<v Speaker 1>signed this open letter and coming into</v>

217
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.420
<v Speaker 1>human resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

218
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.550
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's the same dynamic we have on</v>

219
00:09:17.551 --> 00:09:20.730
<v Speaker 1>campus and the answer to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if anybody,</v>

220
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.530
<v Speaker 1>anybody watching here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you run a business,</v>

221
00:09:22.531 --> 00:09:24.870
<v Speaker 1>if you have friends who are in business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the only,</v>

222
00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:25.720
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

223
00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.360
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're only two stable equilibria.</v>

224
00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:30.510
<v Speaker 1>One is that every organization is just</v>
<v Speaker 1>either,</v>

225
00:09:30.511 --> 00:09:32.760
<v Speaker 1>all right wing were all left wing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that would be disastrous.</v>

226
00:09:32.761 --> 00:09:33.331
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so are there,</v>

227
00:09:33.331 --> 00:09:34.230
<v Speaker 1>you just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

228
00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:35.670
<v Speaker 1>we're on one side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'd be terrible.</v>

229
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.840
<v Speaker 1>The other is what we call the Chicago</v>
<v Speaker 1>principles of free expression.</v>

230
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.740
<v Speaker 1>The University of Chicago has the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>statement out there on how the</v>

231
00:09:43.741 --> 00:09:48.000
<v Speaker 1>university provides a platform on which</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple views can contest.</v>

232
00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:50.310
<v Speaker 1>The university does not take anyone's</v>
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>

233
00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:53.100
<v Speaker 1>That's the only other stable</v>
