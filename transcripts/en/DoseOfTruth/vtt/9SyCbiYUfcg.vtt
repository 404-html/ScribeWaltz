00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.081
Imagine a bubble.

2
00:00:09.081 --> 00:00:10.400
It's like walking up the mountain.

3
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.140
It's a cliff on one side,

4
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:13.573
you know,

5
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.490
you walk higher and higher and maybe it was a crowd of people and then the whole

6
00:00:16.491 --> 00:00:17.360
crowd is st g's.

7
00:00:17.361 --> 00:00:17.720
You know,

8
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.560
it looks like this upwards road goes on forever.

9
00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.320
Aren't we doing much better than those fools who stayed on the flat ground?

10
00:00:24.321 --> 00:00:28.610
And the answer to that is absolutely until you take one step over the cliff,

11
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.230
the problem is you're in a fog.

12
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.270
You don't know where the cliffs is,

13
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.120
you don't even know if there is a cliff to probably is a cliff because there's

14
00:00:35.121 --> 00:00:36.230
been a cliff before,

15
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.880
but you know lots of people.

16
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.060
And the media of course was focusing on those people because it was a time of

17
00:00:41.061 --> 00:00:41.870
optimism said,

18
00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.220
oh well the rules are different this time we're in a state of permanent economic

19
00:00:46.221 --> 00:00:47.001
expansion.

20
00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:48.890
The Internet has transformed everything.

21
00:00:48.891 --> 00:00:50.630
We're in a new electronic age,

22
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.393
maybe,

23
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.673
<v 2>maybe</v>

24
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:56.950
<v 1>didn't work out that way.</v>

25
00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:58.361
And then everyone says,

26
00:00:58.361 --> 00:00:58.541
well,

27
00:00:58.541 --> 00:01:00.820
we were fools to think that this couldn't happen.

28
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.140
Well,

29
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:02.973
the problem,

30
00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:04.420
it's going to happen.

31
00:01:04.421 --> 00:01:05.950
The problem is you can't tell when.

32
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:08.650
That's the problem with life.

33
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.260
It's going to happen and you can't tell him when.
