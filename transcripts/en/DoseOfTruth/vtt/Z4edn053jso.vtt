1
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:06.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:07.763
<v Speaker 1>Piaget,</v>

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.220
<v Speaker 1>Piaget,</v>

4
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.650
<v Speaker 1>the developmental psychologist who's a very smart guy,</v>

5
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.350
<v Speaker 1>he pointed out something very interesting.</v>

6
00:00:13.351 --> 00:00:14.010
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

7
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.010
<v Speaker 1>now imagine you ran a set of iterated games as a competition and in one iterated</v>

8
00:00:19.621 --> 00:00:22.500
<v Speaker 1>game the rule was you bloody well do what I tell you to.</v>

9
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:24.300
<v Speaker 1>And the other one is,</v>

10
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.721
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

11
00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:27.000
<v Speaker 1>we'll all get together and decide how we're going to do this.</v>

12
00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:27.271
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

13
00:00:27.271 --> 00:00:28.620
<v Speaker 1>now we run the competition.</v>

14
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.230
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

15
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.720
<v Speaker 1>Piaget's claim is you do what I tell you fail.</v>

16
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.230
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is I have to impose force in order to keep you</v>

17
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.093
<v Speaker 1>cooperating.</v>

18
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.800
<v Speaker 1>And the imposition of forest is a cost.</v>

19
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.420
<v Speaker 1>It's an efficiency cost.</v>

20
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.020
<v Speaker 1>And across time that efficiency cost is going to multiply.</v>

21
00:00:46.021 --> 00:00:48.330
<v Speaker 1>And the equilibrated state solution,</v>

22
00:00:48.331 --> 00:00:51.000
<v Speaker 1>which is the one where we all agree it wins.</v>

23
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.280
<v Speaker 1>Now that's worth thinking about.</v>

24
00:00:53.281 --> 00:00:54.750
<v Speaker 1>You think you think about that locally.</v>

25
00:00:54.751 --> 00:00:55.320
<v Speaker 1>So you've got,</v>

26
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.730
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to organize your family,</v>

27
00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.900
<v Speaker 1>you have a little family conference about who's doing what in the household and</v>

28
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:01.291
<v Speaker 1>what do you,</v>

29
00:01:01.291 --> 00:01:04.410
<v Speaker 1>if you want peace and harmony and an iterated game,</v>

30
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:05.640
<v Speaker 1>you get everybody to say,</v>

31
00:01:05.641 --> 00:01:05.791
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

32
00:01:05.791 --> 00:01:08.760
<v Speaker 1>here's the tasks and we they have to be done.</v>

33
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.140
<v Speaker 1>People have to agree on that.</v>

34
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.831
<v Speaker 1>And then you say,</v>

35
00:01:10.831 --> 00:01:10.951
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

36
00:01:10.951 --> 00:01:12.330
<v Speaker 1>which task would you do?</v>

37
00:01:12.331 --> 00:01:14.160
<v Speaker 1>You have to some how about you?</v>

38
00:01:14.161 --> 00:01:14.671
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

39
00:01:14.671 --> 00:01:15.720
<v Speaker 1>which task would you do?</v>

40
00:01:15.721 --> 00:01:16.950
<v Speaker 1>And everybody agrees.</v>

41
00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:18.690
<v Speaker 1>And then you say,</v>

42
00:01:18.691 --> 00:01:18.961
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

43
00:01:18.961 --> 00:01:20.670
<v Speaker 1>unless you can come up with a better solution,</v>

44
00:01:20.671 --> 00:01:22.050
<v Speaker 1>that's the one we're going to go with.</v>

45
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.830
<v Speaker 1>And then people can be a little resentful and angry about the conditions of</v>

46
00:01:25.831 --> 00:01:27.780
<v Speaker 1>existence where they have to work,</v>

47
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.030
<v Speaker 1>but they can't really blame that on anyone else.</v>

48
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.490
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that's the best solution you could come up with.</v>

49
00:01:32.491 --> 00:01:35.070
<v Speaker 1>And that was Piaget's idea of the [inaudible] state.</v>

50
00:01:35.071 --> 00:01:35.904
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

51
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.060
<v Speaker 1>it's a voluntary agreement that can be iterated across time that works at</v>

52
00:01:42.061 --> 00:01:44.340
<v Speaker 1>multiple levels of social organization.</v>

53
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.990
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

54
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.890
<v Speaker 1>that's a serious,</v>

55
00:01:46.891 --> 00:01:47.401
<v Speaker 1>serious,</v>

56
00:01:47.401 --> 00:01:49.080
<v Speaker 1>serious set of constraints.</v>

57
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.191
<v Speaker 1>And Piaget.</v>

58
00:01:50.191 --> 00:01:50.641
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

59
00:01:50.641 --> 00:01:54.450
<v Speaker 1>it was looking for a way to reconcile science and religion.</v>

60
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.100
<v Speaker 1>He was looking for a biological origin to morality and he thought he found it in</v>

61
00:01:59.101 --> 00:02:02.250
<v Speaker 1>the idea of the equilla braided state and it's even deeper than that.</v>

62
00:02:02.251 --> 00:02:04.830
<v Speaker 1>So imagine this equilibrating state ideas.</v>

63
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.660
<v Speaker 1>Actually there's something to it that if you set the the state up property,</v>

64
00:02:09.661 --> 00:02:13.410
<v Speaker 1>it will iterate across time so long that it becomes a permanent part of the</v>

65
00:02:13.411 --> 00:02:14.244
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>

66
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.540
<v Speaker 1>The hierarchy is exactly,</v>

67
00:02:15.541 --> 00:02:17.010
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what a hierarchies.</v>

68
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.740
<v Speaker 1>Hierarchies are 350 million years old.</v>

69
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.010
<v Speaker 1>They're not that patriarchal invention of white European Christian males in the</v>

70
00:02:25.831 --> 00:02:27.000
<v Speaker 1>last 300 years.</v>

71
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.700
<v Speaker 1>There are 350 million years old.</v>

72
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:30.960
<v Speaker 1>They're stable,</v>

73
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.040
<v Speaker 1>they're stable solutions to this iterative game problem and they've been around</v>

74
00:02:35.041 --> 00:02:37.410
<v Speaker 1>so long that we're actually adapted to the,</v>

75
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.890
<v Speaker 1>and that's part of the reason we have archetypal representations of the social</v>

76
00:02:40.891 --> 00:02:41.724
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

77
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.570
<v Speaker 1>So and then we also have architectural representations of the relationship of</v>

78
00:02:45.571 --> 00:02:48.690
<v Speaker 1>the individual to the social structure.</v>

79
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.000
<v Speaker 1>Your job as an individual in relationship to the social structure is to embody</v>

80
00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:55.380
<v Speaker 1>the social structure,</v>

81
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.100
<v Speaker 1>but also just serve as as its eyes and its mouth.</v>

82
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.140
<v Speaker 1>So that can update itself would necessary.</v>

83
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.320
<v Speaker 1>So you take on the mantle of your father,</v>

84
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.250
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

85
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.660
<v Speaker 1>but he's dead.</v>

86
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.850
<v Speaker 1>He's the path he can't see.</v>

87
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:10.990
<v Speaker 1>You can see.</v>

88
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.410
<v Speaker 1>So you take the structure that's already there and you modify it where it's</v>

89
00:03:14.411 --> 00:03:19.360
<v Speaker 1>necessary and that modification process is necessary or the state becomes too</v>

90
00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:20.710
<v Speaker 1>static and collapses.</v>

91
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.920
<v Speaker 1>And that's why the state has to be subordinate to the individual.</v>

92
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:29.020
<v Speaker 1>And that's what Western culture has discovered and we can't just let them go.</v>

93
00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:29.790
<v Speaker 1>That's the idea.</v>

94
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:30.430
<v Speaker 1>The logos,</v>

95
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.080
<v Speaker 1>that's a big idea.</v>

96
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.680
<v Speaker 1>And you'd want to live somewhere where you want to live somewhere where the</v>

97
00:03:35.681 --> 00:03:37.390
<v Speaker 1>individual is subordinate to the state.</v>

98
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:37.691
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

99
00:03:37.691 --> 00:03:38.110
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

100
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.741
<v Speaker 1>go right ahead.</v>

101
00:03:38.741 --> 00:03:39.970
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of places like that,</v>

102
00:03:39.971 --> 00:03:40.360
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

103
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.130
<v Speaker 1>emigrate go there.</v>

104
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.310
<v Speaker 1>90% of the world's countries are like that.</v>

105
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.570
<v Speaker 1>If you want to live like that,</v>

106
00:03:46.571 --> 00:03:46.811
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

107
00:03:46.811 --> 00:03:48.250
<v Speaker 1>go find out what it's like.</v>

108
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.160
<v Speaker 1>You don't see immigration going there,</v>

109
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.180
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

110
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.431
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

111
00:03:54.431 --> 00:03:57.010
<v Speaker 1>so that's a big mistake that the postmodernist made.</v>

112
00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:58.420
<v Speaker 1>It's not trivial.</v>

113
00:03:58.421 --> 00:03:59.350
<v Speaker 1>That's a big mistake,</v>

114
00:03:59.351 --> 00:04:00.490
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the only one.</v>
