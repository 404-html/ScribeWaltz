1
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.960
<v Speaker 1>Supporting evidence for that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

2
00:00:07.961 --> 00:00:10.810
<v Speaker 1>From a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from psycho linguistics,</v>

3
00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.500
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a level of,</v>

4
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.730
<v Speaker 1>of categorization that we seem to</v>
<v Speaker 1>manifest more or less automatically or</v>

5
00:00:19.151 --> 00:00:20.710
<v Speaker 1>implicitly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

6
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.920
<v Speaker 1>when children perceive animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

7
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.100
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they perceive at the level of cat or</v>

8
00:00:27.101 --> 00:00:28.300
<v Speaker 1>dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>

9
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.560
<v Speaker 1>they don't perceive that the level of</v>
<v Speaker 1>subspecies like cat or,</v>

10
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.753
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.780
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or uh,</v>

12
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.460
<v Speaker 1>let's say Sam Lloyd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:37.660
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this,</v>

14
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.970
<v Speaker 1>there's a natural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember what they call that</v>

15
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.470
<v Speaker 1>base category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

16
00:00:41.471 --> 00:00:44.590
<v Speaker 1>It's usually specified by very short</v>
<v Speaker 1>words that are easily learnable.</v>

17
00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.620
<v Speaker 1>And so the linguistic system seems to</v>
<v Speaker 1>map right onto the,</v>

18
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.930
<v Speaker 1>to the object recognition</v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristics of the sensory systems</v>

19
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.770
<v Speaker 1>that are built right into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

20
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.760
<v Speaker 1>and if they weren't built into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we couldn't communicate easily because</v>

21
00:00:57.761 --> 00:00:59.500
<v Speaker 1>our natural categories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's it,</v>

22
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.960
<v Speaker 1>but it's probably wrong or natural</v>
<v Speaker 1>categories.</v>

23
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.860
<v Speaker 1>They have to be the same for everyone or</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be very difficult for us to</v>

24
00:01:05.861 --> 00:01:07.180
<v Speaker 1>communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

25
00:01:07.181 --> 00:01:09.970
<v Speaker 1>So having said all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the question is,</v>

26
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:11.920
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the most,</v>

27
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.190
<v Speaker 1>what are the most real categories?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's,</v>

28
00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.920
<v Speaker 1>there's a real division in ways to think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this because there's a scientific</v>

29
00:01:20.921 --> 00:01:22.670
<v Speaker 1>way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

30
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.320
<v Speaker 1>and in that case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most real categories are,</v>

31
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.160
<v Speaker 1>well mathematical equations certainly</v>
<v Speaker 1>seem to be in the top category there,</v>

32
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.120
<v Speaker 1>the equations that describe the physical</v>
<v Speaker 1>universe,</v>

33
00:01:34.121 --> 00:01:38.890
<v Speaker 1>but then then the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hypothesis of the existence of such</v>

34
00:01:38.891 --> 00:01:42.340
<v Speaker 1>things as protons and electrons and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

35
00:01:42.341 --> 00:01:42.880
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

36
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.130
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the material elements that make up</v>

37
00:01:45.131 --> 00:01:48.670
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's every element of being with the</v>

38
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.160
<v Speaker 1>possible exception of empty space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

39
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.090
<v Speaker 1>but in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the mythological world,</v>

40
00:01:55.091 --> 00:02:00.091
<v Speaker 1>the categories I think are more derived</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Darwinian by the effect of</v>

41
00:02:01.301 --> 00:02:04.270
<v Speaker 1>Darwinian processes on cognitive and</v>
<v Speaker 1>perceptual function.</v>

42
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.550
<v Speaker 1>So which is to say that we have learned</v>
<v Speaker 1>to perceive and then to infer those</v>

43
00:02:09.551 --> 00:02:13.240
<v Speaker 1>things that are most necessary for us in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to continue our existence,</v>

44
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.700
<v Speaker 1>propagate live well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of those things.</v>

45
00:02:15.701 --> 00:02:18.580
<v Speaker 1>And that would be true at the level of</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual survival.</v>

46
00:02:18.581 --> 00:02:20.620
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it's also true at the level of</v>
<v Speaker 1>group survival.</v>

47
00:02:20.621 --> 00:02:21.940
<v Speaker 1>Although you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

48
00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.480
<v Speaker 1>there's a tremendous debate among</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary biologists about whether or</v>

49
00:02:25.481 --> 00:02:28.180
<v Speaker 1>not selection can take place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the level of the group</v>

50
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.650
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are these basic level categories</v>

51
00:02:32.651 --> 00:02:36.070
<v Speaker 1>that manifest themselves to you and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's categories of the imagination</v>

52
00:02:36.071 --> 00:02:39.310
<v Speaker 1>that you have to infer up from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensory domain,</v>

53
00:02:39.311 --> 00:02:44.311
<v Speaker 1>and we do that partly in science by</v>
<v Speaker 1>comparing our sensory representations</v>

54
00:02:44.621 --> 00:02:47.260
<v Speaker 1>across people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we also do it by thinking</v>

55
00:02:47.261 --> 00:02:50.590
<v Speaker 1>abstractly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualizing abstractly and no.</v>

56
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.200
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that's interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>about abstractions,</v>

57
00:02:53.201 --> 00:02:56.260
<v Speaker 1>it's not clear whether they're more or</v>
<v Speaker 1>less real than the things they're</v>

58
00:02:56.261 --> 00:02:58.120
<v Speaker 1>obstructed from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

59
00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.930
<v Speaker 1>this is a perennial among,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's call them ontologists,</v>

60
00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:06.460
<v Speaker 1>who were interested in the fundamental,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental nature of reality itself.</v>

61
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.610
<v Speaker 1>In some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>independent of conceptual structures.</v>

62
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.610
<v Speaker 1>Our numbers more or less real than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things they represent.</v>

63
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.330
<v Speaker 1>It's a really hard question to answer</v>
<v Speaker 1>because knowing like using numbers as a</v>

64
00:03:19.391 --> 00:03:23.230
<v Speaker 1>representational system gives you</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable power and there are</v>

65
00:03:23.231 --> 00:03:25.780
<v Speaker 1>mathematicians that believed that there</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't anything more real than</v>

66
00:03:25.781 --> 00:03:27.400
<v Speaker 1>mathematical representations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

67
00:03:27.401 --> 00:03:30.580
<v Speaker 1>It depends to some degree of course on</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you classify reality.</v>

68
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.730
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem with a question like</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a a equivalent to be.</v>

69
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.570
<v Speaker 1>The answer to that always is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

70
00:03:37.571 --> 00:03:40.390
<v Speaker 1>it depends on how you define a and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>depends on how you define be,</v>

71
00:03:40.391 --> 00:03:42.730
<v Speaker 1>so generally it's not a very useful</v>
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>

72
00:03:42.731 --> 00:03:46.330
<v Speaker 1>but you can still get the point that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something very real about</v>

73
00:03:46.331 --> 00:03:49.840
<v Speaker 1>abstractions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly real because otherwise why</v>

74
00:03:49.841 --> 00:03:52.060
<v Speaker 1>would you bother with them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't give you any handle on the</v>

75
00:03:52.061 --> 00:03:53.560
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's the,</v>

76
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.500
<v Speaker 1>what's the most useful or what's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most,</v>

77
00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.860
<v Speaker 1>what's the broadest possible level of</v>
<v Speaker 1>abstraction and is there any use of any</v>

78
00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:03.820
<v Speaker 1>utility in thinking in that manner.</v>

79
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.820
<v Speaker 1>And I tried to make the case last time</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that in the mythological world</v>

80
00:04:09.311 --> 00:04:12.680
<v Speaker 1>there are three categories or four</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on what you do with the</v>

81
00:04:12.681 --> 00:04:15.850
<v Speaker 1>strange fourth category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the fourth category is sort of</v>

82
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.970
<v Speaker 1>the category of uncategorizable entities</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it's sort of the category of</v>

83
00:04:21.491 --> 00:04:23.440
<v Speaker 1>everything that not only do you not</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

84
00:04:23.441 --> 00:04:24.980
<v Speaker 1>but you don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what it's.</v>

85
00:04:24.981 --> 00:04:26.800
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you can think about it as the</v>

86
00:04:26.801 --> 00:04:29.920
<v Speaker 1>category of potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually think that's the best way to</v>

87
00:04:29.921 --> 00:04:34.480
<v Speaker 1>think about it is that it's the dragon</v>
<v Speaker 1>of chaos is the category of potential.</v>

88
00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:38.890
<v Speaker 1>And I do believe that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our materialist view is essentially</v>

89
00:04:38.891 --> 00:04:41.020
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that the proper way of looking</v>

90
00:04:41.021 --> 00:04:45.730
<v Speaker 1>at the at being is that being his</v>
<v Speaker 1>potential and from that potential,</v>

91
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.780
<v Speaker 1>whatever consciousness is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extracts out the reality that we inhabit</v>

92
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:51.940
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's certainly the mythological</v>

93
00:04:51.941 --> 00:04:52.500
<v Speaker 1>viewpoint.</v>

94
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.440
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

95
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.450
<v Speaker 1>but it's not just a mythological</v>
<v Speaker 1>viewpoint,</v>

96
00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:56.310
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

97
00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.870
<v Speaker 1>it's a sequence of ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

98
00:04:58.871 --> 00:05:02.950
<v Speaker 1>that deeply underlies the thinking of</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Piaget and Piaget by the way.</v>

99
00:05:02.951 --> 00:05:06.640
<v Speaker 1>It was very interested in reconciling</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gap between religion and science.</v>

100
00:05:06.641 --> 00:05:08.610
<v Speaker 1>That's really what he devoted his life</v>
<v Speaker 1>to doing.</v>

101
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.570
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there are other streams of</v>

102
00:05:10.571 --> 00:05:14.140
<v Speaker 1>philosophy and I would say heidegger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's phenomenologists are,</v>

103
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.920
<v Speaker 1>are thinking along the lines that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>similar to this as well because</v>

104
00:05:17.921 --> 00:05:20.620
<v Speaker 1>heidegger was concerned not with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of material reality,</v>

105
00:05:20.621 --> 00:05:23.470
<v Speaker 1>but with being as such and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

106
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.510
<v Speaker 1>and so you can extract out the viewpoint</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I just described from,</v>

107
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.290
<v Speaker 1>from mythology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it isn't the only source of such a,</v>

108
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.840
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A high</v>

109
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.730
<v Speaker 1>hypotheses is probably the right idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

110
00:05:39.731 --> 00:05:42.010
<v Speaker 1>so the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think about this as a</v>

111
00:05:42.011 --> 00:05:46.120
<v Speaker 1>bootstrapping process in some senses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order for anything to get going,</v>

112
00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.410
<v Speaker 1>it has to bootstrap itself up and become</v>
<v Speaker 1>more and more complex as it does that.</v>

113
00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:52.480
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like this is the answer to the</v>

114
00:05:52.481 --> 00:05:54.130
<v Speaker 1>chicken and egg problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

115
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.260
<v Speaker 1>Which was first the chicken or the egg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

116
00:05:56.261 --> 00:05:58.550
<v Speaker 1>neither.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something from which both the chicken</v>

117
00:05:58.551 --> 00:05:59.780
<v Speaker 1>and egg were derived,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

118
00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.920
<v Speaker 1>Because the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate,</v>

119
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.250
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate answer to that is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>answer to how there are things at all,</v>

120
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.590
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at some point there were neither</v>

121
00:06:06.591 --> 00:06:08.900
<v Speaker 1>chickens nor eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there were the things that were the</v>

122
00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:13.901
<v Speaker 1>precursors to those things and so they</v>
<v Speaker 1>spiraled upwards in some sense.</v>

123
00:06:14.451 --> 00:06:18.770
<v Speaker 1>And those in the initial protocol</v>
<v Speaker 1>entities,</v>

124
00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:22.490
<v Speaker 1>single celled animals for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to go back farther than that.</v>

125
00:06:22.491 --> 00:06:23.211
<v Speaker 1>But we could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

126
00:06:23.211 --> 00:06:26.060
<v Speaker 1>single cell animals differentiated over</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

127
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.820
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's this looping process that,</v>

128
00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.690
<v Speaker 1>that differentiates out into both the</v>
<v Speaker 1>chicken and the egg.</v>

129
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.240
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what the question is,</v>

130
00:06:35.241 --> 00:06:37.490
<v Speaker 1>what do you need in order for that</v>
<v Speaker 1>process to begin?</v>

131
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.570
<v Speaker 1>And that's really the question of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental constituent elements of</v>

132
00:06:41.571 --> 00:06:44.810
<v Speaker 1>reality are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the mythological hypothesis is that</v>

133
00:06:44.811 --> 00:06:48.620
<v Speaker 1>there's three or four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is the fact that there has to be</v>

134
00:06:48.621 --> 00:06:50.240
<v Speaker 1>something that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

135
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.210
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that manifests itself as an observer.</v>

136
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.140
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some kind of observer now where that</v>

137
00:06:57.141 --> 00:07:00.950
<v Speaker 1>process of observation starts in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>phylogenetic chain is very,</v>

138
00:07:00.951 --> 00:07:03.300
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

139
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:04.041
<v Speaker 1>we might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

140
00:07:04.041 --> 00:07:07.460
<v Speaker 1>there's certainly no possibility of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious observer until there's a</v>

141
00:07:07.461 --> 00:07:08.360
<v Speaker 1>differentiated nervous.</v>
