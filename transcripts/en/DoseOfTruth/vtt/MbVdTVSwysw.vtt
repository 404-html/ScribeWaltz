00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.150
<v Speaker 1>Many of my friends sing the wonders of diversity.</v>

2
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.870
<v Speaker 1>I tried to tell them diversity isn't a moral good,</v>

3
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.000
<v Speaker 1>but I end up looking like some terrible racist.</v>

4
00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:16.410
<v Speaker 1>Why isn't diversity moral good?</v>

5
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.300
<v Speaker 1>While diversity is our moral good,</v>

6
00:00:18.301 --> 00:00:19.590
<v Speaker 1>but you can't,</v>

7
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.070
<v Speaker 1>diversity by race doesn't produce diversity.</v>

8
00:00:23.071 --> 00:00:23.430
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

9
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.780
<v Speaker 1>that's called racism.</v>

10
00:00:24.781 --> 00:00:29.310
<v Speaker 1>That idea or diversity of gender doesn't produce diversity unless that's how you</v>

11
00:00:29.311 --> 00:00:30.240
<v Speaker 1>define diversity.</v>

12
00:00:30.241 --> 00:00:31.074
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

13
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.420
<v Speaker 1>let's say that you get diversity partly as a consequence of personality,</v>

14
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.790
<v Speaker 1>which is a good way of looking at it.</v>

15
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.100
<v Speaker 1>There is more diversity within groups of people then between,</v>

16
00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:47.460
<v Speaker 1>so like men and women differ to some degree in their personalities,</v>

17
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.230
<v Speaker 1>but there's far more difference between men within the male group and women</v>

18
00:00:52.231 --> 00:00:53.280
<v Speaker 1>within the male group.</v>

19
00:00:53.281 --> 00:00:56.550
<v Speaker 1>Then there is between the average or typical male and female.</v>

20
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.560
<v Speaker 1>So it's a stupid wait.</v>

21
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.120
<v Speaker 1>Let's assume that what you want,</v>

22
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.260
<v Speaker 1>the organization's pursuing your complex goal and you want a variety of skills</v>

23
00:01:06.541 --> 00:01:08.520
<v Speaker 1>that would be suited to that goal.</v>

24
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.830
<v Speaker 1>Then you want there to be enough diversity of ability within the group so that</v>

25
00:01:13.831 --> 00:01:17.370
<v Speaker 1>the goal can be achieved in a efficient and,</v>

26
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:18.503
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

27
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.460
<v Speaker 1>and inexpensive manner.</v>

28
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.821
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

29
00:01:20.821 --> 00:01:22.080
<v Speaker 1>Because what do you want</v>

30
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.770
<v Speaker 1>on efficient and expensive?</v>

31
00:01:25.771 --> 00:01:26.820
<v Speaker 1>Obviously not.</v>

32
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.270
<v Speaker 1>So there's a presumption that you get diversity by using identity politics</v>

33
00:01:33.151 --> 00:01:33.691
<v Speaker 1>categories,</v>

34
00:01:33.691 --> 00:01:36.720
<v Speaker 1>but there's absolutely no evidence for that whatsoever.</v>

35
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.680
<v Speaker 1>So that's why diversity defined by race or ethnicity or gender is not only not a</v>

36
00:01:45.421 --> 00:01:46.050
<v Speaker 1>moral good,</v>

37
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.820
<v Speaker 1>it's actually a moral evil because it dispenses with the whole idea of the</v>

38
00:01:50.821 --> 00:01:52.080
<v Speaker 1>individual dispenses.</v>

39
00:01:52.081 --> 00:01:53.370
<v Speaker 1>With the idea of competence.</v>

40
00:01:53.371 --> 00:01:57.630
<v Speaker 1>It just replaces it with the assumption that if you randomly select from the</v>

41
00:01:57.631 --> 00:01:58.381
<v Speaker 1>population,</v>

42
00:01:58.381 --> 00:02:00.810
<v Speaker 1>because that's how you would get real equity,</v>

43
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.280
<v Speaker 1>you randomly select from the population that that gives you the best qualified</v>

44
00:02:05.281 --> 00:02:06.210
<v Speaker 1>group of people.</v>

45
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.230
<v Speaker 1>Well that's just,</v>

46
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.070
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

47
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.960
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't do that to select the plumber.</v>

48
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.251
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

49
00:02:10.251 --> 00:02:14.040
<v Speaker 1>it's the stupidest possible way of selecting for anything randomly,</v>

50
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:15.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

51
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.200
<v Speaker 1>there's no difference between selecting randomly and selecting accidentally.</v>

52
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.650
<v Speaker 1>So it's moral diversity defined properly is a moral good diversity based on</v>

53
00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:27.091
<v Speaker 1>identity,</v>

54
00:02:27.091 --> 00:02:29.490
<v Speaker 1>politics categories is a positive evil,</v>

55
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

56
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.553
<v Speaker 1>true to our,</v>

57
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:32.910
<v Speaker 1>our prime ministers.</v>

58
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.290
<v Speaker 1>Great example of that.</v>

59
00:02:34.291 --> 00:02:35.550
<v Speaker 1>So back,</v>

60
00:02:35.551 --> 00:02:40.140
<v Speaker 1>I think it was in 2015 he announced that half of his cabinet was going to be</v>

61
00:02:40.141 --> 00:02:45.141
<v Speaker 1>women because it was 2015 or something like muddle headed virtue signaling,</v>

62
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.780
<v Speaker 1>signaling excuse for not thinking.</v>

63
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.560
<v Speaker 1>I think only 20% or 25% of the elected mps were female.</v>

64
00:02:53.561 --> 00:02:57.750
<v Speaker 1>So the proper balance on average would it be 25% female,</v>

65
00:02:57.751 --> 00:02:59.290
<v Speaker 1>75% male.</v>

66
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.380
<v Speaker 1>What he should've done was figured out who,</v>

67
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.880
<v Speaker 1>what qualities would make for a competent cabinet minister because it's actually</v>

68
00:03:06.881 --> 00:03:11.800
<v Speaker 1>quite important to have competent cabinet ministers and then selected from among</v>

69
00:03:11.801 --> 00:03:14.770
<v Speaker 1>his people for nothing other than competence.</v>

70
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.850
<v Speaker 1>But he could virtue signal and then he set up the most important board,</v>

71
00:03:18.851 --> 00:03:21.600
<v Speaker 1>let's say of the entire comp country on it.</v>

72
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.190
<v Speaker 1>Cause I random basis Jesus,</v>

73
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.270
<v Speaker 1>how pathetic.</v>

74
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.870
<v Speaker 1>He should have been pilloried by Canadians for that.</v>

75
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.760
<v Speaker 1>But we're so clued out and,</v>

76
00:03:30.761 --> 00:03:33.080
<v Speaker 1>and also in this situation that you described,</v>

77
00:03:33.081 --> 00:03:34.840
<v Speaker 1>just like if I say,</v>

78
00:03:34.841 --> 00:03:35.051
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

79
00:03:35.051 --> 00:03:37.960
<v Speaker 1>50% of Trudeau's cabinet shouldn't have been women.</v>

80
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.740
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

81
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:39.011
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

82
00:03:39.011 --> 00:03:40.060
<v Speaker 1>you're a misogynist.</v>

83
00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:40.451
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

84
00:03:40.451 --> 00:03:41.110
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

85
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.200
<v Speaker 1>only 25% of the elected officials were women.</v>

86
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.011
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>

87
00:03:45.011 --> 00:03:45.310
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

88
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.860
<v Speaker 1>it would be better if 50% of the were elected.</v>

89
00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:48.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

90
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.630
<v Speaker 1>maybe it would be better,</v>

91
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:50.860
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't happen.</v>

92
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:52.870
<v Speaker 1>So you can't,</v>

93
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.360
<v Speaker 1>you can't fix it at the top end.</v>

94
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.560
<v Speaker 1>It was appalling.</v>

95
00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.930
<v Speaker 1>So it's a hard argument to make,</v>

96
00:03:58.931 --> 00:03:59.171
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

97
00:03:59.171 --> 00:04:04.171
<v Speaker 1>because you need to know that there's more difference within groups then between</v>

98
00:04:04.331 --> 00:04:07.540
<v Speaker 1>them in order to be able to come up with a credible argument,</v>

99
00:04:07.541 --> 00:04:08.374
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

100
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.210
<v Speaker 1>And then so yeah.</v>
