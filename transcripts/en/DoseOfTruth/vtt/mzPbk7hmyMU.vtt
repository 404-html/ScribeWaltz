1
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.930
<v Speaker 1>Do what is meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not what is expedient.</v>

2
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.880
<v Speaker 1>And when you do what is meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you stay in the kingdom that you've</v>

3
00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:18.450
<v Speaker 1>established,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't stay completely in it</v>

4
00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:21.720
<v Speaker 1>because you need to challenge yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>and grow.</v>

5
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.960
<v Speaker 1>And so you put one foot tentatively out</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the domain that supersedes your</v>

6
00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:33.330
<v Speaker 1>competence and you maintain stability</v>
<v Speaker 1>and grow at the same time.</v>

7
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.720
<v Speaker 1>And when you're doing that properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the f psychological consequences of</v>

8
00:00:40.531 --> 00:00:44.790
<v Speaker 1>that is the immersement in a meaningful</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

9
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.570
<v Speaker 1>It's a deep instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you know,</v>

10
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.950
<v Speaker 1>if you watch yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

11
00:00:49.951 --> 00:00:51.840
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a particularly good day at work</v>

12
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.300
<v Speaker 1>and what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

13
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.840
<v Speaker 1>it means that you lost your sense of</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

14
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.210
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when you're having not a good</v>

15
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.840
<v Speaker 1>day at work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like first it's one minute to three</v>

16
00:01:03.841 --> 00:01:04.674
<v Speaker 1>and then it's</v>

17
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.270
<v Speaker 1>45 seconds to three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it's 30 seconds.</v>

18
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.460
<v Speaker 1>That's what school was like for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like</v>

19
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.350
<v Speaker 1>click.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So funny.</v>

20
00:01:16.351 --> 00:01:17.580
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to,</v>

21
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.140
<v Speaker 1>I went to my daughter's school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to get in trouble for talking all</v>

22
00:01:22.141 --> 00:01:23.100
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Surprise,</v>

23
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.170
<v Speaker 1>surprise when I was a kid and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was bored stiff in school and so I</v>

24
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:33.630
<v Speaker 1>would misbehave upon occasion out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>pure boredom.</v>

25
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.260
<v Speaker 1>And about 21 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to my daughter's school to sit</v>

26
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.360
<v Speaker 1>for a class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was about an hour long and uh,</v>

27
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.940
<v Speaker 1>I was sitting there and the teacher had</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the kids on the floor and was having</v>

28
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.720
<v Speaker 1>some of the kids read to the others and</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the kids who were reading</v>

29
00:01:54.721 --> 00:01:59.460
<v Speaker 1>couldn't read at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I had exactly the same experience.</v>

30
00:01:59.461 --> 00:02:00.840
<v Speaker 1>I was sitting there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like being,</v>

31
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.810
<v Speaker 1>it's like being seven years old again</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I could see the clock going,</v>

32
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.790
<v Speaker 1>tick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tick.</v>

33
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.020
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:02:09.021 --> 00:02:10.670
<v Speaker 1>if I was in this classroom for three</v>
<v Speaker 1>days,</v>

35
00:02:10.671 --> 00:02:13.820
<v Speaker 1>I would misbehave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fit 40 years old,</v>

36
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
<v Speaker 1>I would miss behave exactly like I did</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was when I was six.</v>

37
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.700
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's no place to be right because</v>

38
00:02:22.701 --> 00:02:24.830
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to be in a place that</v>

39
00:02:24.831 --> 00:02:27.290
<v Speaker 1>stultifying you don't want to be in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>place where there's no challenge.</v>

40
00:02:27.291 --> 00:02:29.390
<v Speaker 1>You might even quit your job if there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>no challenge.</v>

41
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:30.890
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's a good job.</v>

42
00:02:30.891 --> 00:02:32.510
<v Speaker 1>It gives you security and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

43
00:02:32.511 --> 00:02:34.640
<v Speaker 1>I can't stand this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's eating away at my soul.</v>

44
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.270
<v Speaker 1>It's all security and no challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why do you want a challenge?</v>

45
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.260
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's what you're built for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're built for.</v>

46
00:02:42.261 --> 00:02:45.380
<v Speaker 1>Your built to take on a maximal load,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

47
00:02:45.381 --> 00:02:48.410
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's what strengthens you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you need to be strong because life</v>

48
00:02:48.411 --> 00:02:49.790
<v Speaker 1>is extraordinarily difficult.</v>

49
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.570
<v Speaker 1>And because the evil king is always</v>
<v Speaker 1>whittling away at the structure of the</v>

50
00:02:53.571 --> 00:02:57.560
<v Speaker 1>state and you have to be awake and sharp</v>
<v Speaker 1>to stop that from happening so that you</v>

51
00:02:57.561 --> 00:03:01.060
<v Speaker 1>don't become corrupt and so that your</v>
<v Speaker 1>family doesn't become corrupt.</v>

52
00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:04.330
<v Speaker 1>And so that your state doesn't have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be come become corrupt.</v>

53
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.020
<v Speaker 1>You have to have your eyes open and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>which sharp and your words at the ready.</v>

54
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.290
<v Speaker 1>And you have to be educated and you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to know about your history.</v>

55
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.030
<v Speaker 1>And you know how have to know how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

56
00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:15.730
<v Speaker 1>And you have to know how to read and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to know how to speak.</v>

57
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.210
<v Speaker 1>And you have to know how to aim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have to be willing to hoist the</v>

58
00:03:19.211 --> 00:03:21.190
<v Speaker 1>troubles of the world up on your</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulders.</v>

59
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.400
<v Speaker 1>And what's so interesting about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so remarkable,</v>

60
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.210
<v Speaker 1>and this is something that's really</v>
<v Speaker 1>manifested itself to me as I've been</v>

61
00:03:28.211 --> 00:03:29.380
<v Speaker 1>doing these public lectures.</v>

62
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.600
<v Speaker 1>I've been talking about responsibility</v>
<v Speaker 1>to people,</v>

63
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.030
<v Speaker 1>which doesn't seem to happen very often</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>

64
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.770
<v Speaker 1>and the audiences are dead quiet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I lay out this idea that life is</v>

65
00:03:38.771 --> 00:03:41.830
<v Speaker 1>tragedy tainted by malevolence and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone says,</v>

66
00:03:41.831 --> 00:03:44.050
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we already always suspected that,</v>

67
00:03:44.051 --> 00:03:46.030
<v Speaker 1>but no one has ever said it quite so</v>
<v Speaker 1>bluntly,</v>

68
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.200
<v Speaker 1>and it's quite a relief to hear that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the only person who has those</v>

69
00:03:50.201 --> 00:03:53.200
<v Speaker 1>suspicions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the second part of that is the</v>

70
00:03:53.201 --> 00:03:55.210
<v Speaker 1>better part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's the optimistic part,</v>

71
00:03:55.211 --> 00:04:00.211
<v Speaker 1>which is despite the fact that life is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tragedy tainted by malevolence at every</v>

72
00:04:02.111 --> 00:04:05.230
<v Speaker 1>level of existence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something about the human spirit</v>

73
00:04:05.231 --> 00:04:10.231
<v Speaker 1>that can thrive under precisely those</v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions if we allow that to occur.</v>

74
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.100
<v Speaker 1>Because as difficult as life is and as</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible as we are,</v>

75
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.520
<v Speaker 1>our capacity to deal with that</v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe and to transcend that</v>

76
00:04:20.621 --> 00:04:23.500
<v Speaker 1>malevolent spirit is more powerful than</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

77
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.030
<v Speaker 1>than that reality itself.</v>

78
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.070
<v Speaker 1>And that's the fundamental issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the fundamental issue of</v>

79
00:04:30.071 --> 00:04:33.700
<v Speaker 1>the Judaeo Christian ethic with its</v>
<v Speaker 1>emphasis on the divinity of the</v>

80
00:04:33.701 --> 00:04:37.390
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As catastrophic as life is and as</v>

81
00:04:37.391 --> 00:04:42.391
<v Speaker 1>malevolent as people can be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's malevolent beyond belief.</v>

82
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.940
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a person has in spirit the nobility to</v>

83
00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.460
<v Speaker 1>set that right and to defeat evil and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and that more than that and that</v>

84
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.300
<v Speaker 1>the antidote to the catastrophe of life</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the suffering of life and the</v>

85
00:04:58.301 --> 00:05:01.660
<v Speaker 1>tragedy of life that can drive you down</v>
<v Speaker 1>and destroy you,</v>

86
00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.440
<v Speaker 1>is to take on exactly that</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and to say,</v>

87
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.140
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's plenty of work to be done and</v>

88
00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:13.090
<v Speaker 1>isn't that terrible and there isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything so bad that we can't make it</v>

89
00:05:13.091 --> 00:05:15.970
<v Speaker 1>worse and certainly try very hard to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

90
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.950
<v Speaker 1>But I have it within me to decide that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to stand up against that.</v>

91
00:05:20.951 --> 00:05:23.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to strive to make the world a</v>
<v Speaker 1>better place.</v>

92
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:27.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to strive to constrain the</v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolence that's in my own heart and</v>

93
00:05:27.071 --> 00:05:32.071
<v Speaker 1>to set my family's straight and to work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to work despite my tragic lot for the</v>

94
00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:36.070
<v Speaker 1>betterment of anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of everything that's in front of me.</v>

95
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.180
<v Speaker 1>And the consequence of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the immediate consequence of that is</v>

96
00:05:40.181 --> 00:05:44.770
<v Speaker 1>that when you make the decision to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>on all of that voluntarily,</v>

97
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.140
<v Speaker 1>which is to stand up straight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

98
00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.440
<v Speaker 1>with your shoulders back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take on that,</v>

99
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.230
<v Speaker 1>all that on voluntarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as you make that decision,</v>

100
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.310
<v Speaker 1>then all the catastrophe justifies</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself in the nobility of your striving.</v>

101
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.420
<v Speaker 1>And that's what it means to be an</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>

102
00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:04.263
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

103
00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:10.220
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
