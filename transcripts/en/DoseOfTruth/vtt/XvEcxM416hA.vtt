1
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.020
<v Speaker 1>So I have this program called holding cell fourth program.</v>

2
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.330
<v Speaker 1>Its components is the future arm program.</v>

3
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.920
<v Speaker 1>And I was speaking to consider their lives deeply and to develop a vision and a</v>

4
00:00:37.931 --> 00:00:38.764
<v Speaker 1>strategy.</v>

5
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.170
<v Speaker 1>And it's not easy to have someone who hasn't been encouraged that say,</v>

6
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.120
<v Speaker 1>my vision has been on practice.</v>

7
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.033
<v Speaker 1>Avid.</v>

8
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.981
<v Speaker 1>People say,</v>

9
00:00:50.981 --> 00:00:51.161
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

10
00:00:51.161 --> 00:00:52.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what I should be doing.</v>

11
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.620
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

12
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.160
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

13
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.461
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:00:54.461 --> 00:00:56.110
<v Speaker 1>some things you shouldn't be doing.</v>

15
00:00:56.111 --> 00:00:57.280
<v Speaker 1>So that's a good start.</v>

16
00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.860
<v Speaker 1>I do need them.</v>

17
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.550
<v Speaker 1>And it was practical planner.</v>

18
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.680
<v Speaker 1>If you don't know what to do,</v>

19
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.260
<v Speaker 1>you would start by stopping doing all the stupid things that you're doing that</v>

20
00:01:05.261 --> 00:01:06.150
<v Speaker 1>you know are stupid.</v>

21
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.460
<v Speaker 1>And that's a good start if it starts to clear your vision,</v>

22
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

23
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.953
<v Speaker 1>So if you,</v>

24
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.940
<v Speaker 1>if you don't know what to do,</v>

25
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.540
<v Speaker 1>but you do know that you're doing things that you're ashamed of,</v>

26
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:16.960
<v Speaker 1>something you regret,</v>

27
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.220
<v Speaker 1>you could start by just</v>

28
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.280
<v Speaker 1>eliminated in one by one and slowly to the best of your ability.</v>

29
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.070
<v Speaker 1>And then there's your,</v>

30
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.540
<v Speaker 1>so that journey of matter is starting to become disciplined.</v>

31
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.480
<v Speaker 1>The false of ethical rules on some set of ethical rules.</v>

32
00:01:31.481 --> 00:01:32.640
<v Speaker 1>And with any luck,</v>

33
00:01:32.641 --> 00:01:35.020
<v Speaker 1>it can follow a set of ethical rules long enough,</v>

34
00:01:35.021 --> 00:01:36.170
<v Speaker 1>then you'll get disciplines enough.</v>

35
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.210
<v Speaker 1>So you'll start to have a clear vision and then you might be able to see the way</v>

36
00:01:40.211 --> 00:01:41.044
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>

37
00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.290
<v Speaker 1>Or you might see a way more important for intended rather than merely what you</v>

38
00:01:47.141 --> 00:01:47.974
<v Speaker 1>should avoid.</v>

39
00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.980
<v Speaker 1>So that's a good initial practical issue.</v>

40
00:01:49.981 --> 00:01:51.080
<v Speaker 1>It's well,</v>

41
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.990
<v Speaker 1>because everyone knows you know perfectly well that there are things you would</v>

42
00:01:54.991 --> 00:01:55.690
<v Speaker 1>do even,</v>

43
00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:56.640
<v Speaker 1>you know you shouldn't do,</v>

44
00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.941
<v Speaker 1>but you don't.</v>

45
00:01:57.941 --> 00:01:58.930
<v Speaker 1>Stall</v>

46
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.460
<v Speaker 1>started stopping</v>

47
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.830
<v Speaker 1>because of the natural part of this idea about putting your house in perfect</v>

48
00:02:08.831 --> 00:02:10.840
<v Speaker 1>order before you criticize the world.</v>

49
00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.560
<v Speaker 1>Because there's a question that's always open and that's,</v>

50
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.770
<v Speaker 1>suppose this is the question,</v>

51
00:02:14.771 --> 00:02:15.310
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

52
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.970
<v Speaker 1>They'd gone placed in front of cake.</v>

53
00:02:16.971 --> 00:02:17.804
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

54
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.221
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

55
00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:18.941
<v Speaker 1>how do you know the world?</v>

56
00:02:18.941 --> 00:02:21.520
<v Speaker 1>Would we interpret places you weren't sent to Richard thing?</v>

57
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:23.830
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it wouldn't be.</v>

58
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:25.750
<v Speaker 1>And I don't mean might say,</v>

59
00:02:25.751 --> 00:02:26.690
<v Speaker 1>well that's pretty challenging,</v>

60
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:27.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

61
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.760
<v Speaker 1>Would you say to people who has a parent who's dying of Alzheimer's disease,</v>

62
00:02:30.761 --> 00:02:31.510
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

63
00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.040
<v Speaker 1>like wasn't gonna hit their act together and he's going to fix that.</v>

64
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like it made it a hell of a lot better than it wouldn't be otherwise.</v>

65
00:02:37.571 --> 00:02:38.404
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you that.</v>

66
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.690
<v Speaker 1>And that's something because it's bad enough to have someone who's dead and you</v>

67
00:02:42.691 --> 00:02:46.840
<v Speaker 1>and your family without having an incredible amount of unnecessary pathology</v>

68
00:02:46.841 --> 00:02:50.530
<v Speaker 1>gathering around that and make something that could be merely tragic into</v>

69
00:02:50.531 --> 00:02:51.460
<v Speaker 1>something that's outlined.</v>

70
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.680
<v Speaker 1>Hell No.</v>

71
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.310
<v Speaker 1>It happens to people all the time.</v>

72
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.340
<v Speaker 1>And so even if it's not the perfect solution,</v>

73
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.760
<v Speaker 1>the best solution that you have,</v>

74
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.770
<v Speaker 1>and then the next part of that is when I suggested to people that they do the</v>

75
00:03:05.771 --> 00:03:08.070
<v Speaker 1>future authoring program and they're,</v>

76
00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.150
<v Speaker 1>they're leery about doing it.</v>

77
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.290
<v Speaker 1>I asked them to do it back because a bad plan is way better than no plan.</v>

78
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.220
<v Speaker 1>Because if you didn't come into town,</v>

79
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.890
<v Speaker 1>they didn't learn why you should that plan.</v>

80
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:24.590
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

81
00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Not Hypothetically,</v>

82
00:03:25.481 --> 00:03:27.610
<v Speaker 1>but exactly in the world.</v>

83
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:28.540
<v Speaker 1>And then in the news,</v>

84
00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:33.310
<v Speaker 1>that information above her failure to retool a better clap.</v>

85
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.690
<v Speaker 1>And so the English like manufacture,</v>

86
00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.560
<v Speaker 1>you're tracking the destination,</v>

87
00:03:37.561 --> 00:03:38.161
<v Speaker 1>it's moving,</v>

88
00:03:38.161 --> 00:03:41.350
<v Speaker 1>there's some kind of ideal and your vision is blurry.</v>

89
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.380
<v Speaker 1>You don't know where to look.</v>

90
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.250
<v Speaker 1>So you're going to go this way and then you can go that way.</v>

91
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.360
<v Speaker 1>We can go this way.</v>

92
00:03:46.361 --> 00:03:47.960
<v Speaker 1>But if you keep doing that big,</v>

93
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.120
<v Speaker 1>the deviations from the right path agreed going to decrease his time and</v>

94
00:03:52.121 --> 00:03:55.720
<v Speaker 1>eventually you'll be walking forward in an efficient manner.</v>

95
00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.050
<v Speaker 1>And you might have to take all sorts of errors before you manage that.</v>

96
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.980
<v Speaker 1>But I've watched people long enough in my clinical practice to know that waiting</v>

97
00:04:02.981 --> 00:04:07.870
<v Speaker 1>for Kudos and very bad idea and not going up as a very bad idea.</v>

98
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like implement the best plan and half a half</v>

99
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.830
<v Speaker 1>and learn from and that works and you get sharper at making your planets.</v>

100
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.470
<v Speaker 1>And then the other thing that we do with the future authoring program,</v>

101
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:20.800
<v Speaker 1>the school,</v>

102
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.490
<v Speaker 1>we ask people,</v>

103
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.611
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

104
00:04:21.611 --> 00:04:26.611
<v Speaker 1>maybe you can't decide what your passion or your calling should be,</v>

105
00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.020
<v Speaker 1>but it's a pretty cool question.</v>

106
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.430
<v Speaker 1>But you like ask yourself some questions like,</v>

107
00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.953
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

108
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.080
<v Speaker 1>is there something you could do to improve your intimate relationship?</v>

109
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:39.341
<v Speaker 1>One thing,</v>

110
00:04:39.341 --> 00:04:42.700
<v Speaker 1>is there a way that you can improve your friendships?</v>

111
00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.480
<v Speaker 1>Is there something you could do at your job that would make it better than it is</v>

112
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:47.290
<v Speaker 1>now?</v>

113
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.000
<v Speaker 1>Even if it's something incremental,</v>

114
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.470
<v Speaker 1>could you do something more productive and meaningful with your time outside of</v>

115
00:04:53.471 --> 00:04:54.160
<v Speaker 1>work?</v>

116
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.510
<v Speaker 1>Could you be slightly better at handling temptations that come your way?</v>

117
00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.010
<v Speaker 1>Could you take care of herself somewhat better mentally and physically?</v>

118
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.860
<v Speaker 1>And you know the answer to all of those questions is jeopardy.</v>

119
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:06.311
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

120
00:05:06.311 --> 00:05:09.220
<v Speaker 1>And then you can even ask himself a simpler question,</v>

121
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.580
<v Speaker 1>which would be well into something that you could do that would make one post</v>

122
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:15.220
<v Speaker 1>things better.</v>

123
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.990
<v Speaker 1>Is there also something that you would have to,</v>

124
00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.530
<v Speaker 1>and you can ask yourself that instead of telling yourself that you should,</v>

125
00:05:23.531 --> 00:05:25.200
<v Speaker 1>which is the same thing,</v>

126
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.691
<v Speaker 1>might say,</v>

127
00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:29.620
<v Speaker 1>well I would like my marriage and ask yourself,</v>

128
00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:30.940
<v Speaker 1>well how can my marriage be better?</v>

129
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.600
<v Speaker 1>And you'll get a bunch of answers and most of you in place,</v>

130
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.940
<v Speaker 1>because if you really ask yourself the question like that,</v>

131
00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.750
<v Speaker 1>the part of our agreements and magic and who's looking for new masters will tell</v>

132
00:05:40.751 --> 00:05:41.290
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

133
00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.590
<v Speaker 1>And then we'll tell you a bunch of things you don't want to hear.</v>

134
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.110
<v Speaker 1>I load them with the things you already know and some of them will be thinks</v>

135
00:05:47.111 --> 00:05:48.480
<v Speaker 1>that there's just no gam you,</v>

136
00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.200
<v Speaker 1>even though you know that you should,</v>

137
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.610
<v Speaker 1>but some subset of those might be things that you should do that by your own</v>

138
00:05:54.611 --> 00:05:56.950
<v Speaker 1>definition that you actually would</v>

139
00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.920
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

140
00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.540
<v Speaker 1>is there a step in the right direction?</v>

141
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.900
<v Speaker 1>So eight would ever step in the right direction.</v>

142
00:06:05.901 --> 00:06:10.901
<v Speaker 1>You're willing to take day by day and that's incremental progress and it'll</v>

143
00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.490
<v Speaker 1>little spire awkward.</v>

144
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.260
<v Speaker 1>It does fire up well.</v>

145
00:06:15.261 --> 00:06:16.760
<v Speaker 1>There's a stage of the New Testament,</v>

146
00:06:16.761 --> 00:06:18.530
<v Speaker 1>which actually happens to be a true statement,</v>

147
00:06:18.531 --> 00:06:22.040
<v Speaker 1>which is to those who have everything more will be given.</v>

148
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.610
<v Speaker 1>And it's a,</v>

149
00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.400
<v Speaker 1>it's a reflection of underlying phenomenon that looks like phenomenon.</v>

150
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.710
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a natural law,</v>

151
00:06:28.711 --> 00:06:31.580
<v Speaker 1>which means that as things start to recruit to you,</v>

152
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:32.900
<v Speaker 1>the rigging average,</v>

153
00:06:32.901 --> 00:06:35.630
<v Speaker 1>they move further accrue will increase.</v>

154
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.370
<v Speaker 1>That's a natural law school.</v>

155
00:06:37.371 --> 00:06:40.000
<v Speaker 1>Price's law sometimes or deport for Credo,</v>

156
00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:42.200
<v Speaker 1>it's reflective and creative distribution.</v>

157
00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:47.201
<v Speaker 1>So there's a chapter 12 rules for life called don't compare yourself.</v>

158
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:50.750
<v Speaker 1>Compare yourself to where you were yesterday,</v>

159
00:06:50.751 --> 00:06:52.910
<v Speaker 1>not to someone else's today.</v>

160
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.370
<v Speaker 1>And it's an injunction for incremental improvement.</v>

161
00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.350
<v Speaker 1>If you don't know where to go in your life,</v>

162
00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:00.980
<v Speaker 1>well think about where you are and see if today could make,</v>

163
00:07:00.981 --> 00:07:05.150
<v Speaker 1>where do you are somewhat better on some dimension so that when you go to bed at</v>

164
00:07:05.151 --> 00:07:05.720
<v Speaker 1>night,</v>

165
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.660
<v Speaker 1>you're not as rich as you were when you woke up in the morning.</v>

166
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:11.780
<v Speaker 1>And so if you do that in the two years,</v>

167
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

168
00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:13.310
<v Speaker 1>one thing a day,</v>

169
00:07:13.311 --> 00:07:14.270
<v Speaker 1>just a small thing,</v>

170
00:07:14.271 --> 00:07:16.400
<v Speaker 1>something you could actually do that you would do,</v>

171
00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.470
<v Speaker 1>then your life will be way headed.</v>

172
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.730
<v Speaker 1>And at the end of that,</v>

173
00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:23.960
<v Speaker 1>you might have enough clarity of mind to start to understand where you would go</v>

174
00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.090
<v Speaker 1>if things worked out from across the world.</v>
