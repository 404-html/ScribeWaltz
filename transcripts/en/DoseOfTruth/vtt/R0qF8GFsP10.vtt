1
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.140
<v Speaker 1>For coming tonight.</v>

2
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:17.050
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] you</v>

3
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:19.860
<v Speaker 1>need to read this.</v>

4
00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:20.760
<v Speaker 1>The second city,</v>

5
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.790
<v Speaker 1>I just came back from London.</v>

6
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.680
<v Speaker 1>I talked to Sam parents.</v>

7
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:26.740
<v Speaker 1>That's Murray,</v>

8
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.740
<v Speaker 1>so I was very interesting and hopefully those videos in August,</v>

9
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:32.581
<v Speaker 1>that's the plan.</v>

10
00:00:32.581 --> 00:00:34.380
<v Speaker 1>Once they're all properly edited,</v>

11
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.060
<v Speaker 1>if for some point in all of that,</v>

12
00:00:36.061 --> 00:00:39.540
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to be edited for content just for quality.</v>

13
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.441
<v Speaker 1>That's the plan.</v>

14
00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:41.274
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

15
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.540
<v Speaker 1>it's very nice to see all of you here to partake in what I hope will be,</v>

16
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.160
<v Speaker 1>what will be a serious of useful and meaningful.</v>

17
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.560
<v Speaker 1>I want him to talk to you tonight.</v>

18
00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.100
<v Speaker 1>I told her I'd take you through 12 rules for life through the lens of courage.</v>

19
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.940
<v Speaker 1>It's a nice virtue to contemplate a good entry point into the content of the</v>

20
00:01:11.701 --> 00:01:12.001
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>

21
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:16.890
<v Speaker 1>Can I use these lectures as an opportunity to take past what I've already</v>

22
00:01:16.891 --> 00:01:21.891
<v Speaker 1>written to try to make it more coherent and to try to push my thinking in new</v>

23
00:01:23.851 --> 00:01:28.851
<v Speaker 1>directions and so that it stays fresh and vital and so that I learned something</v>

24
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.870
<v Speaker 1>because you can learn something by thinking,</v>

25
00:01:30.871 --> 00:01:32.670
<v Speaker 1>which is generally why people do it.</v>

26
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.670
<v Speaker 1>So I wanted to tell you some things.</v>

27
00:01:38.671 --> 00:01:39.980
<v Speaker 1>First of all about stealing.</v>

28
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.953
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

29
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.460
<v Speaker 1>theories and instinct.</v>

30
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.680
<v Speaker 1>We have a separate neural for theater.</v>

31
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.460
<v Speaker 1>It's the circuit that's affected by drugs that you might take like alcohol,</v>

32
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.240
<v Speaker 1>because alcohol is a very powerful and to anxiety.</v>

33
00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.590
<v Speaker 1>Anxiety and fear are very similar.</v>

34
00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.671
<v Speaker 1>Technically,</v>

35
00:01:59.671 --> 00:02:03.910
<v Speaker 1>people think of ancient anxiety as a fear of something that some nonspecific,</v>

36
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

37
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.250
<v Speaker 1>you'd like to feel anxiety about going to a park or a new job or something like</v>

38
00:02:08.251 --> 00:02:08.461
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

39
00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:10.620
<v Speaker 1>Word might have a phobia,</v>

40
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.260
<v Speaker 1>might be afraid of spiders or snakes or for myself or,</v>

41
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.360
<v Speaker 1>or some port Allen elevators or being exposed to the outside world that Viagra</v>

42
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.223
<v Speaker 1>phobia.</v>

43
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.250
<v Speaker 1>So fear is usually if something specific and anxiety is that something more</v>

44
00:02:26.251 --> 00:02:27.084
<v Speaker 1>general.</v>

45
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.470
<v Speaker 1>But in any case,</v>

46
00:02:28.471 --> 00:02:29.970
<v Speaker 1>we haven't fear circuit,</v>

47
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:31.770
<v Speaker 1>it's very old.</v>

48
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.350
<v Speaker 1>It's designed to stop us from being damaged.</v>

49
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.180
<v Speaker 1>So essentially you become afraid of things that might damage it might hurt</v>

50
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.740
<v Speaker 1>review.</v>

51
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:40.470
<v Speaker 1>We can reframe.</v>

52
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.790
<v Speaker 1>You become afraid of things that might punish and you have a separate circuit</v>

53
00:02:44.791 --> 00:02:45.660
<v Speaker 1>for pain too,</v>

54
00:02:45.661 --> 00:02:47.280
<v Speaker 1>which is a response to punishment.</v>

55
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.760
<v Speaker 1>So pain is usually a signal that something's about to damage.</v>

56
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.950
<v Speaker 1>Some that or something is damaging that's more accurate and pain is a pain.</v>

57
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.970
<v Speaker 1>Pain can be staved off opiates,</v>

58
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.440
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

59
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.360
<v Speaker 1>Those are technically analgesics.</v>

60
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.740
<v Speaker 1>It's fear and anxiety.</v>

61
00:03:05.741 --> 00:03:08.340
<v Speaker 1>It can be staved off by NGS.</v>

62
00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.430
<v Speaker 1>I'll let it's technically speaking.</v>

63
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.380
<v Speaker 1>Those include the alcohol had been such as paints like Valium,</v>

64
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.440
<v Speaker 1>Xanax and so forth and instruments which are not very commonly used it more</v>

65
00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:24.730
<v Speaker 1>medically or for nonmedical state recreational purposes,</v>

66
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.450
<v Speaker 1>but alcohol is a drug that people really liked because it dampens fear and</v>

67
00:03:30.521 --> 00:03:31.150
<v Speaker 1>anxiety,</v>

68
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.140
<v Speaker 1>which is what people,</v>

69
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.820
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the many reasons that people use alcohol,</v>

70
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.220
<v Speaker 1>social circumstances.</v>

71
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.340
<v Speaker 1>Alcohol is a variety of neurochemical effects that vary substantially depending</v>

72
00:03:41.771 --> 00:03:45.940
<v Speaker 1>on who it is constricting because people are differentially sensitive to that</v>

73
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.770
<v Speaker 1>neurochemical effects of alcohol.</v>

74
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:48.760
<v Speaker 1>Some people,</v>

75
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.510
<v Speaker 1>especially people with social anxiety who are sensitive to the anxiety,</v>

76
00:03:52.511 --> 00:03:56.290
<v Speaker 1>letting properties like to drink if they are in a social circumstance because it</v>

77
00:03:56.291 --> 00:04:00.840
<v Speaker 1>makes them less afraid and I sang as you're seeing other people also get out of</v>

78
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.160
<v Speaker 1>stimulant kicked.</v>

79
00:04:02.161 --> 00:04:02.491
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>

80
00:04:02.491 --> 00:04:02.921
<v Speaker 1>Alcohol,</v>

81
00:04:02.921 --> 00:04:07.030
<v Speaker 1>if you're one of those people that has a hard time stopping when you start</v>

82
00:04:07.031 --> 00:04:10.660
<v Speaker 1>drinking and you'd probably get a stimulant and kicking from alcohol,</v>

83
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:11.860
<v Speaker 1>that's dangerous.</v>

84
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.680
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things that can be used and predispose you to alcoholism.</v>

85
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.140
<v Speaker 1>So if you have that response anywhere,</v>

86
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.000
<v Speaker 1>but it also means it,</v>

87
00:04:19.001 --> 00:04:20.110
<v Speaker 1>you really enjoy a level.</v>

88
00:04:20.111 --> 00:04:23.980
<v Speaker 1>So it's harder to be careful that those circumstances because it's such a</v>

89
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.080
<v Speaker 1>wonderful drug,</v>

90
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.913
<v Speaker 1>if that's,</v>

91
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.090
<v Speaker 1>if that's the situation that you're in.</v>

92
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.950
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a separate fear circuit?</v>

93
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:35.020
<v Speaker 1>And the point of fear and anxiety is to stop you when you see things that might</v>

94
00:04:35.021 --> 00:04:39.130
<v Speaker 1>damage pain signals that you are being damaged,</v>

95
00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.790
<v Speaker 1>series signifies that you might be damaged.</v>

96
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.660
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a newer circuit from an evolutionary perspective.</v>

97
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:47.613
<v Speaker 1>Then the pain,</v>

98
00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.560
<v Speaker 1>because it takes a smarter animal.</v>

99
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.170
<v Speaker 1>It's one thing to get the hell out of there when you're in pain,</v>

100
00:04:53.171 --> 00:04:56.680
<v Speaker 1>but it's another thing to be wary when you might be in pain.</v>

101
00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:57.990
<v Speaker 1>That's what fear is for.</v>

102
00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.890
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a very unpleasant emotion,</v>

103
00:04:59.891 --> 00:05:00.281
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

104
00:05:00.281 --> 00:05:02.140
<v Speaker 1>although perhaps not as bad as pain.</v>

105
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.353
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

106
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.080
<v Speaker 1>and I guess that's the,</v>

107
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.110
<v Speaker 1>that's the logical substitute isn't,</v>

108
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.500
<v Speaker 1>it's not so bad and emotion compared to pain you need here to protect you</v>

109
00:05:11.501 --> 00:05:12.850
<v Speaker 1>because you can be heard.</v>

110
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.270
<v Speaker 1>So there's plenty of things to be afraid of,</v>

111
00:05:16.271 --> 00:05:19.730
<v Speaker 1>an anxious about in the world because not only can you be hurt,</v>

112
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.540
<v Speaker 1>you know that you can be heard.</v>

113
00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.450
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things that really distinguishes human beings from other</v>

114
00:05:25.451 --> 00:05:26.210
<v Speaker 1>creatures.</v>

115
00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:27.100
<v Speaker 1>We have a very,</v>

116
00:05:27.101 --> 00:05:32.101
<v Speaker 1>very clear apprehension of our borders and limitations.</v>

117
00:05:32.351 --> 00:05:36.320
<v Speaker 1>We know that even if there's nothing that's making us anxious right here and</v>

118
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:37.180
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>

119
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.780
<v Speaker 1>we know that there are things that might come our way that are quite negative in</v>

120
00:05:40.781 --> 00:05:41.614
<v Speaker 1>the future.</v>

121
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:42.640
<v Speaker 1>And so to some degree,</v>

122
00:05:42.641 --> 00:05:46.290
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason that you would beats are always so conscious of hyper</v>

123
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.280
<v Speaker 1>consciousness because we weld them safe as we aren't right now.</v>

124
00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.980
<v Speaker 1>Something is still lurking around the corner that might,</v>

125
00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:56.780
<v Speaker 1>that might do a CMP.</v>

126
00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.940
<v Speaker 1>If you watch animals like zebras hold on the African film,</v>

127
00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:06.650
<v Speaker 1>they're pretty strange in some ways that their cognitive resources in their</v>

128
00:06:06.681 --> 00:06:08.840
<v Speaker 1>emotional responses are quite limited.</v>

129
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

130
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.460
<v Speaker 1>Zebra heard can be surrounded by lions and as long as the lions aren't getting a</v>

131
00:06:13.461 --> 00:06:17.590
<v Speaker 1>hunting configuration is he was don't really seem to mind the alliance,</v>

132
00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.500
<v Speaker 1>which seems a little bit shortsighted on their part if the Zealand don't seem to</v>

133
00:06:21.501 --> 00:06:24.380
<v Speaker 1>be able to figure out what those sweeping lions are.</v>

134
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.710
<v Speaker 1>Also the same lines that are going to need them tomorrow.</v>

135
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.810
<v Speaker 1>But I guess maybe the advantage of being a zebra and not caring about the</v>

136
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.610
<v Speaker 1>sleeping minds is that while you don't have to be nervous,</v>

137
00:06:34.611 --> 00:06:38.450
<v Speaker 1>except when you're being hunted to where as human beings in a situation like</v>

138
00:06:38.451 --> 00:06:40.670
<v Speaker 1>that would be thinking those damn lions,</v>

139
00:06:40.671 --> 00:06:41.840
<v Speaker 1>they look like they're sleeping.</v>

140
00:06:41.841 --> 00:06:42.740
<v Speaker 1>But you know what,</v>

141
00:06:42.741 --> 00:06:44.090
<v Speaker 1>they'll be up to tomorrow.</v>

142
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:48.950
<v Speaker 1>And of course we do know what things will be up to tomorrow and that means we</v>

143
00:06:48.951 --> 00:06:51.770
<v Speaker 1>can protect ourselves and it's what's coming tomorrow.</v>

144
00:06:51.771 --> 00:06:54.710
<v Speaker 1>But it's at the cost of eternal vigilance.</v>

145
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:59.950
<v Speaker 1>And so that's part of the reason why we're susceptible to drugs like and spasm</v>

146
00:07:00.261 --> 00:07:00.871
<v Speaker 1>beats and barbecue.</v>

147
00:07:00.871 --> 00:07:05.871
<v Speaker 1>It's an alcohol because those drugs to help us quell our internal anxiety.</v>

148
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:11.980
<v Speaker 1>And so now with when psychologists for starting to study fear,</v>

149
00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:15.140
<v Speaker 1>they thought about it wrong.</v>

150
00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:15.890
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

151
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:19.280
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to go through the way they thought about it because sometimes if</v>

152
00:07:19.281 --> 00:07:20.720
<v Speaker 1>you think about something wrong,</v>

153
00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:23.030
<v Speaker 1>you think about it wrong in an interesting way.</v>

154
00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:26.990
<v Speaker 1>And if you think about something in detail wrong,</v>

155
00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.950
<v Speaker 1>at least then you can learn exactly why you're wrong and maybe you could figure</v>

156
00:07:30.951 --> 00:07:32.780
<v Speaker 1>out how not to be wrong with you.</v>

157
00:07:32.781 --> 00:07:33.650
<v Speaker 1>Keep thinking,</v>

158
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:35.870
<v Speaker 1>which is part of the reason by the way,</v>

159
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.770
<v Speaker 1>that free speech is so important because in order to get to the truth,</v>

160
00:07:39.771 --> 00:07:42.770
<v Speaker 1>you have to do a lot of wandering through error.</v>

161
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:47.830
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to be allowed and even encouraged to be stumbling realm and</v>

162
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:48.770
<v Speaker 1>stupid,</v>

163
00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.680
<v Speaker 1>careless and objectionable,</v>

164
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.890
<v Speaker 1>offensive and all of those things in your speech.</v>

165
00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.590
<v Speaker 1>Because if you can't come around stupidly,</v>

166
00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:02.270
<v Speaker 1>you're never going to be able to think anything through because you have to know</v>

167
00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:06.920
<v Speaker 1>how to speak properly to begin with about something complex.</v>

168
00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:10.880
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to do it properly and you don't know how to do complicated</v>

169
00:08:10.881 --> 00:08:14.120
<v Speaker 1>things that you don't understand property and so you're not going to speak about</v>

170
00:08:14.121 --> 00:08:16.550
<v Speaker 1>this very well and so it'd be good to speak about them at all,</v>

171
00:08:16.551 --> 00:08:17.990
<v Speaker 1>which you have to want to learn about them.</v>

172
00:08:17.991 --> 00:08:21.520
<v Speaker 1>Then you have to be encouraged to stumble around badly.</v>

173
00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:25.060
<v Speaker 1>I have this program and that some of you might be interested.</v>

174
00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.650
<v Speaker 1>It's part of the self authoring suite,</v>

175
00:08:27.651 --> 00:08:32.000
<v Speaker 1>which is a sequence of writing programs that my colleagues and I generated to</v>

176
00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.980
<v Speaker 1>help people clinically.</v>

177
00:08:33.981 --> 00:08:38.981
<v Speaker 1>I would say we were trying to figure out how we could bring clinically powerful</v>

178
00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:43.900
<v Speaker 1>technologies to a mass market at a very low cost.</v>

179
00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:48.050
<v Speaker 1>We discovered through reading the relevant literature and through our own</v>

180
00:08:48.051 --> 00:08:51.740
<v Speaker 1>scientific research that if you had people write about uncertainty,</v>

181
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:54.980
<v Speaker 1>then that would make them more productive and more engaged,</v>

182
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:56.243
<v Speaker 1>healthier.</v>

183
00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.930
<v Speaker 1>Many people have done research of that sort.</v>

184
00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:00.650
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

185
00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:01.381
<v Speaker 1>not off put by it.</v>

186
00:09:01.381 --> 00:09:02.940
<v Speaker 1>It needs to be definitely in my class.</v>

187
00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:07.210
<v Speaker 1>The first program was passed off free program and it helps people write and</v>

188
00:09:07.211 --> 00:09:08.350
<v Speaker 1>structured autobiography.</v>

189
00:09:08.351 --> 00:09:12.150
<v Speaker 1>So it helps you divide your life up into six parts and then great about the</v>

190
00:09:12.151 --> 00:09:17.040
<v Speaker 1>emotionally significant events in each of those epoxy or s section.</v>

191
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:18.120
<v Speaker 1>There's a hint in,</v>

192
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.650
<v Speaker 1>this is some three to think about.</v>

193
00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:22.110
<v Speaker 1>It's very relevant to the topic of tonight's talk.</v>

194
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:27.560
<v Speaker 1>If you have a memory that's older than about 18 months and there's a reason for</v>

195
00:09:27.601 --> 00:09:28.434
<v Speaker 1>that by the way,</v>

196
00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:33.620
<v Speaker 1>but what we'll say 18 months from now and when you bring that memory to mind,</v>

197
00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:37.440
<v Speaker 1>it's still causes an emotional reaction and I'm thinking mostly about a negative</v>

198
00:09:37.441 --> 00:09:38.310
<v Speaker 1>emotion reaction.</v>

199
00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:43.350
<v Speaker 1>That means that you haven't fully processed that memory and it's still weighing</v>

200
00:09:43.351 --> 00:09:44.340
<v Speaker 1>down on you.</v>

201
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:48.120
<v Speaker 1>And I mean one of the things your brain is always trying to do is try to</v>

202
00:09:48.121 --> 00:09:50.970
<v Speaker 1>calculate how dangerous the current environment is.</v>

203
00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.180
<v Speaker 1>And the answer that is something like,</v>

204
00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.113
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

205
00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.890
<v Speaker 1>your brain assumes the current environment is dangerous in proportion to the</v>

206
00:09:58.891 --> 00:10:01.830
<v Speaker 1>number of things that have occurred in your life and you haven't been able to</v>

207
00:10:01.831 --> 00:10:02.760
<v Speaker 1>figure out.</v>

208
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.700
<v Speaker 1>So the more things that you haven't figured out,</v>

209
00:10:05.701 --> 00:10:06.890
<v Speaker 1>the more dangerous you're very,</v>

210
00:10:06.891 --> 00:10:09.840
<v Speaker 1>this is the environment is and the price you paid for that.</v>

211
00:10:09.841 --> 00:10:12.650
<v Speaker 1>If you're more anxious and not only that,</v>

212
00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:14.190
<v Speaker 1>you produce more stress hormones,</v>

213
00:10:14.191 --> 00:10:15.450
<v Speaker 1>especially cortisol.</v>

214
00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:17.910
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with producing excess cortisol,</v>

215
00:10:17.911 --> 00:10:18.980
<v Speaker 1>you need to produce some,</v>

216
00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:20.190
<v Speaker 1>it helps wake you up in the morning.</v>

217
00:10:20.191 --> 00:10:24.180
<v Speaker 1>But if you produce excess excess portal that makes you cool.</v>

218
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:30.110
<v Speaker 1>And so it contributes to virtually every degenerative physiological process that</v>

219
00:10:30.121 --> 00:10:30.954
<v Speaker 1>we know of.</v>

220
00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.960
<v Speaker 1>And so cleaning up your past is actually a really good idea.</v>

221
00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:34.890
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

222
00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:37.260
<v Speaker 1>if something that happened in a long time,</v>

223
00:10:37.261 --> 00:10:38.340
<v Speaker 1>it goes to a baud assume.</v>

224
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:40.670
<v Speaker 1>The reason for that is,</v>

225
00:10:40.671 --> 00:10:43.050
<v Speaker 1>is that the emotional systems,</v>

226
00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.750
<v Speaker 1>the underlying emotional systems that helping process the world,</v>

227
00:10:45.751 --> 00:10:49.530
<v Speaker 1>especially the emotions that are associated with fear and anxiety are telling</v>

228
00:10:49.531 --> 00:10:54.531
<v Speaker 1>you that you have encountered something in your pathway in,</v>

229
00:10:54.541 --> 00:10:55.170
<v Speaker 1>in your,</v>

230
00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:56.150
<v Speaker 1>in your past,</v>

231
00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.870
<v Speaker 1>in your past that you did on master,</v>

232
00:11:00.871 --> 00:11:04.620
<v Speaker 1>and it still would present a danger to you if you encountered begin.</v>

233
00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:05.981
<v Speaker 1>And so it's,</v>

234
00:11:05.981 --> 00:11:10.230
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting to contemplate that because we don't often think about the</v>

235
00:11:10.231 --> 00:11:11.310
<v Speaker 1>purpose of memory.</v>

236
00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:12.031
<v Speaker 1>We think,</v>

237
00:11:12.031 --> 00:11:12.330
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

238
00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.390
<v Speaker 1>the purpose of memories to remember the past,</v>

239
00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.170
<v Speaker 1>that's actually not true.</v>

240
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:20.580
<v Speaker 1>The purpose of memory is to extract the information hope from the past so you</v>

241
00:11:20.581 --> 00:11:23.280
<v Speaker 1>don't do the same damn stupid thing than once.</v>

242
00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:25.950
<v Speaker 1>And then that truly is the purpose of memory.</v>

243
00:11:25.951 --> 00:11:26.960
<v Speaker 1>That is how your,</v>

244
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.830
<v Speaker 1>that's how your memories are constructed.</v>

245
00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:30.660
<v Speaker 1>That's how your mind looks at the past.</v>

246
00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:35.790
<v Speaker 1>What you're trying to do is to map out the world and you use your past</v>

247
00:11:35.791 --> 00:11:40.050
<v Speaker 1>experience to elaborate up that map and then you use that map to orient yourself</v>

248
00:11:40.051 --> 00:11:40.950
<v Speaker 1>into the future.</v>

249
00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:41.431
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

250
00:11:41.431 --> 00:11:44.250
<v Speaker 1>So that's the derivation of wisdom from the past.</v>

251
00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:45.270
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

252
00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:45.631
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

253
00:11:45.631 --> 00:11:46.910
<v Speaker 1>once you mastered fire,</v>

254
00:11:46.911 --> 00:11:48.330
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to be burned,</v>

255
00:11:48.331 --> 00:11:48.810
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

256
00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:52.380
<v Speaker 1>You could encounter and truly dangerous things and you can learn how to master</v>

257
00:11:52.381 --> 00:11:54.580
<v Speaker 1>them and then when you would come to them in the future,</v>

258
00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.470
<v Speaker 1>they're not dangerous.</v>

259
00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:57.610
<v Speaker 1>And so that's perfect.</v>

260
00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:00.790
<v Speaker 1>Like if you have something in your past can still bought,</v>

261
00:12:00.791 --> 00:12:01.151
<v Speaker 1>I just used.</v>

262
00:12:01.151 --> 00:12:04.480
<v Speaker 1>That means that as far as your underlying emotional systems are concerned,</v>

263
00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:06.760
<v Speaker 1>you are not master of that event.</v>

264
00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:11.850
<v Speaker 1>And that bothers some emotion will never go away until you go back to that</v>

265
00:12:12.641 --> 00:12:17.110
<v Speaker 1>memory and you've figured out how it was that you rendered vulnerable in that</v>

266
00:12:17.111 --> 00:12:21.520
<v Speaker 1>situation and what you would have to do now in order to reconfigure the way you</v>

267
00:12:21.521 --> 00:12:25.720
<v Speaker 1>look at the world or the way that you act so that that vulnerability with</v>

268
00:12:25.721 --> 00:12:26.620
<v Speaker 1>disappeared.</v>

269
00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:30.580
<v Speaker 1>And so if you do the past offering programming reasonably carefully,</v>

270
00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:31.330
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

271
00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:32.320
<v Speaker 1>reasonably thoroughly,</v>

272
00:12:32.321 --> 00:12:33.154
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

273
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:34.023
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

274
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.170
<v Speaker 1>then you can,</v>

275
00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.510
<v Speaker 1>you can find all those things in your past.</v>

276
00:12:37.511 --> 00:12:40.210
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't mastered your over common,</v>

277
00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:41.103
<v Speaker 1>that can,</v>

278
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:45.010
<v Speaker 1>that will update you and it'll make your map more differentiated.</v>

279
00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:49.000
<v Speaker 1>It will make you more skillful and drop your stress levels.</v>

280
00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:53.770
<v Speaker 1>It's also a useful thing to do from a conceptual perspective because as I said</v>

281
00:12:53.771 --> 00:12:54.131
<v Speaker 1>already,</v>

282
00:12:54.131 --> 00:12:57.970
<v Speaker 1>partly what you're trying to do in your life is mapped your way forward,</v>

283
00:12:57.971 --> 00:12:58.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

284
00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:02.110
<v Speaker 1>Because people are forward moving creatures who are always going from point a to</v>

285
00:13:02.111 --> 00:13:02.950
<v Speaker 1>point B.</v>

286
00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:03.181
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>

287
00:13:03.181 --> 00:13:04.900
<v Speaker 1>we're on a journey or an adventure.</v>

288
00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:05.690
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

289
00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:05.990
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

290
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:06.330
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

291
00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:09.520
<v Speaker 1>and you need to map out your journey or your invention.</v>

292
00:13:09.521 --> 00:13:11.230
<v Speaker 1>What do you need to know where you're going,</v>

293
00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:12.250
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>

294
00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.050
<v Speaker 1>but you also have to know where you are.</v>

295
00:13:14.051 --> 00:13:14.321
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

296
00:13:14.321 --> 00:13:16.480
<v Speaker 1>if you're using a map,</v>

297
00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:17.660
<v Speaker 1>like an actual announcement,</v>

298
00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:20.530
<v Speaker 1>it's completely useless to just know where you're going.</v>

299
00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:24.550
<v Speaker 1>You also have to know where the hell you are and if you're scattered all over</v>

300
00:13:24.551 --> 00:13:25.360
<v Speaker 1>the place,</v>

301
00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.360
<v Speaker 1>which is which,</v>

302
00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:27.460
<v Speaker 1>which is really the case.</v>

303
00:13:27.461 --> 00:13:30.880
<v Speaker 1>If there's a lot of things in your past that are unresolved that it's</v>

304
00:13:30.881 --> 00:13:34.360
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily hard to map your way forward because you don't even know where</v>

305
00:13:34.361 --> 00:13:35.350
<v Speaker 1>to start.</v>

306
00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:37.030
<v Speaker 1>And so that's,</v>

307
00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:38.310
<v Speaker 1>that's a useful action socks.</v>

308
00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:41.170
<v Speaker 1>And I often encourage people to do that,</v>

309
00:13:41.171 --> 00:13:44.280
<v Speaker 1>exercise that and that</v>

310
00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:47.110
<v Speaker 1>reflects,</v>

311
00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:49.330
<v Speaker 1>that's a reflection of what I first said.</v>

312
00:13:49.331 --> 00:13:51.040
<v Speaker 1>It bubbles on speech.</v>

313
00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:52.173
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

314
00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:55.000
<v Speaker 1>You have to stumble around and won if you're going to get to where you're going.</v>

315
00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:58.420
<v Speaker 1>And so if you want to write about your past and bring yourself up to date,</v>

316
00:13:58.450 --> 00:13:59.800
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to do it perfectly,</v>

317
00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:01.620
<v Speaker 1>but you definitely have to do it.</v>

318
00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:06.340
<v Speaker 1>You have to confront those things in your past are weighing you down and making</v>

319
00:14:06.341 --> 00:14:09.790
<v Speaker 1>you better and making you're resentful and freezing you in place.</v>

320
00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:10.541
<v Speaker 1>And all of that.</v>

321
00:14:10.541 --> 00:14:12.610
<v Speaker 1>And it's also the case.</v>

322
00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:16.090
<v Speaker 1>We'll get to this in more detail as we progress that.</v>

323
00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:17.163
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

324
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:17.970
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

325
00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:18.803
<v Speaker 1>you</v>

326
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:22.183
<v Speaker 1>a minute.</v>

327
00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:23.860
<v Speaker 1>So the second,</v>

328
00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:25.300
<v Speaker 1>the second part of the,</v>

329
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:30.750
<v Speaker 1>of the self authoring suite helps you identify your virtues and your calls front</v>

330
00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.780
<v Speaker 1>of layer stating virtue for thinking.</v>

331
00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.820
<v Speaker 1>We talked about faults in the modern world,</v>

332
00:14:36.821 --> 00:14:38.420
<v Speaker 1>but we don't often talk about virtue to,</v>

333
00:14:38.421 --> 00:14:40.150
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of an old fashioned term,</v>

334
00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:45.030
<v Speaker 1>but I picked it specifically for that reason because Virtusa useful terms</v>

335
00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:46.510
<v Speaker 1>virtually isn't,</v>

336
00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.940
<v Speaker 1>it's an unbelievably useful term.</v>

337
00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:49.541
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

338
00:14:49.541 --> 00:14:51.830
<v Speaker 1>it's fundamentally a term</v>

339
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:56.980
<v Speaker 3>rather than a moral term because your virtues are precisely that kit of tools</v>

340
00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:01.940
<v Speaker 3>that's that you have in hand and help you contend the world.</v>

341
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.270
<v Speaker 3>It's best to think of virtues as tools rather than characteristics.</v>

342
00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:08.080
<v Speaker 3>And so if you've been identifying faults,</v>

343
00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.700
<v Speaker 3>those are the things that are obstacles to your progress.</v>

344
00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:12.300
<v Speaker 3>And so by your own definition,</v>

345
00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:16.400
<v Speaker 3>but say that's how the exercise is set up and used a pseudonym you want and need</v>

346
00:15:16.401 --> 00:15:16.851
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

347
00:15:16.851 --> 00:15:17.810
<v Speaker 3>you're pursuing it.</v>

348
00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.690
<v Speaker 3>There's going to be elements of their own character that get in the way.</v>

349
00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:22.520
<v Speaker 3>You probably want to do something about that,</v>

350
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:25.290
<v Speaker 3>assuming that you want to get to where you're going.</v>

351
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:27.990
<v Speaker 3>And of course you do because if you didn't want to get into areas you wouldn't</v>

352
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.650
<v Speaker 3>the positive as a destination to begin with.</v>

353
00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:33.590
<v Speaker 3>So obviously they want to get there and if you are,</v>

354
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:37.270
<v Speaker 3>if you do want to get there and there are things about the way you're behaving</v>

355
00:15:37.271 --> 00:15:40.610
<v Speaker 3>in the world that are in the way and obviously it would be better for you to</v>

356
00:15:40.611 --> 00:15:41.330
<v Speaker 3>rectify them.</v>

357
00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:42.950
<v Speaker 3>So that's fair himself rather than,</v>

358
00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:47.750
<v Speaker 3>and then equally it's equally the case that some of characteristics that you</v>

359
00:15:47.751 --> 00:15:52.580
<v Speaker 3>have that will move you forward into the world are going to be useful and you</v>

360
00:15:52.581 --> 00:15:55.490
<v Speaker 3>should know how to capitalize on them and you should be conscious of that</v>

361
00:15:55.491 --> 00:15:57.350
<v Speaker 3>because why not be conscious of it.</v>

362
00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:02.740
<v Speaker 3>It's useful to know yourself so that you can use yourself more effectively.</v>

363
00:16:03.211 --> 00:16:08.030
<v Speaker 3>And then the final exercise is the future authoring program.</v>

364
00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:10.310
<v Speaker 3>We've had lots of fun with that.</v>

365
00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:15.640
<v Speaker 3>I designed that years ago when I noticed in my class this class online maps,</v>

366
00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:18.410
<v Speaker 3>it's classical maps of meaning,</v>

367
00:16:18.411 --> 00:16:23.210
<v Speaker 3>which is the vote by well which just came up in the audio version.</v>

368
00:16:23.211 --> 00:16:23.900
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

369
00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.610
<v Speaker 3>do you like 12 rules you might like,</v>

370
00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:26.713
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

371
00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:27.830
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot harder.</v>

372
00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:28.610
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

373
00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:29.930
<v Speaker 3>but it's also about papers.</v>

374
00:16:29.931 --> 00:16:31.580
<v Speaker 3>So if you want to go paper,</v>

375
00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:32.930
<v Speaker 3>well that's going to be harder,</v>

376
00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:33.823
<v Speaker 3>often sleep.</v>

377
00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:35.240
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

378
00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:35.510
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

379
00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:39.590
<v Speaker 3>if you found from 12 rules for life useful than going deeper might even be more</v>

380
00:16:39.591 --> 00:16:40.424
<v Speaker 3>useful.</v>

381
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:42.590
<v Speaker 3>And so the audio version might be good for that.</v>

382
00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:43.663
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

383
00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:44.553
<v Speaker 3>when I,</v>

384
00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:45.580
<v Speaker 3>that's uh,</v>

385
00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:49.790
<v Speaker 3>it's a book about the story of your life because your life is a story.</v>

386
00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:54.350
<v Speaker 3>A story is a description of how you move from point a to B and what sort of</v>

387
00:16:54.351 --> 00:16:56.390
<v Speaker 3>pitfalls you might encounter along the way.</v>

388
00:16:56.420 --> 00:17:01.220
<v Speaker 3>How you fall apart in your journey towards a higher good and how you put</v>

389
00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:02.600
<v Speaker 3>yourself back together.</v>

390
00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:03.523
<v Speaker 3>That's a story.</v>

391
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:08.420
<v Speaker 3>Maps of meaning is about what stories are and what perhaps with the greatest</v>

392
00:17:08.421 --> 00:17:08.931
<v Speaker 3>story is,</v>

393
00:17:08.931 --> 00:17:12.880
<v Speaker 3>which is a good thing to know since you have to act out as four minus galacto</v>

394
00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:15.870
<v Speaker 3>great one since what?</v>

395
00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.390
<v Speaker 3>Since you don't have better</v>

396
00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:21.680
<v Speaker 3>words,</v>

397
00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:22.371
<v Speaker 3>they think about,</v>

398
00:17:22.371 --> 00:17:26.900
<v Speaker 3>so because the maps of meaning with about stories and because I believe that</v>

399
00:17:26.901 --> 00:17:31.880
<v Speaker 3>people's lives are misconstrued as stories and perhaps even the reality itself</v>

400
00:17:31.881 --> 00:17:36.710
<v Speaker 3>as best construed as a story as otherwise we wouldn't use stories to represented</v>

401
00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:37.970
<v Speaker 3>so continually.</v>

402
00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:38.720
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

403
00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.040
<v Speaker 3>I had people write up,</v>

404
00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:42.340
<v Speaker 3>start to write up the story of their,</v>

405
00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:43.640
<v Speaker 3>their future life.</v>

406
00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:47.240
<v Speaker 3>So it's kind of an interesting exercise.</v>

407
00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:48.743
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

408
00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:49.240
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

409
00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:49.740
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

410
00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:53.550
<v Speaker 3>it's related to rule 10 and 12 for life,</v>

411
00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:55.080
<v Speaker 3>which is beat precisely.</v>

412
00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:56.040
<v Speaker 3>You've speak,</v>

413
00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:58.090
<v Speaker 3>no one's ever told me,</v>

414
00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:01.290
<v Speaker 3>no one's ever really told why you should be precise in your speech.</v>

415
00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:06.530
<v Speaker 3>But the reason is for the same reason that when you shoot a rifle at a target,</v>

416
00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:09.570
<v Speaker 3>you aim at the center,</v>

417
00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:11.130
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

418
00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:12.190
<v Speaker 3>It's not random.</v>

419
00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:16.080
<v Speaker 3>You don't just sort of pointing your gun and shoot approximately in the</v>

420
00:18:16.081 --> 00:18:17.490
<v Speaker 3>direction of the target.</v>

421
00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:20.310
<v Speaker 3>You specify it as precisely as you can.</v>

422
00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:22.590
<v Speaker 3>And then you pull the trigger.</v>

423
00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:23.251
<v Speaker 3>You might think,</v>

424
00:18:23.251 --> 00:18:23.461
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

425
00:18:23.461 --> 00:18:28.461
<v Speaker 3>it's a strange thing to use of say a military analogy and analogy with weapons,</v>

426
00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:34.830
<v Speaker 3>but it's not a strange thing at all because if you think about the things that</v>

427
00:18:34.831 --> 00:18:35.664
<v Speaker 3>people do,</v>

428
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:40.560
<v Speaker 3>if you think about the dramatic things that people do</v>

429
00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:44.880
<v Speaker 3>where people are trying to hit the center of targets all the time and we love</v>

430
00:18:44.881 --> 00:18:45.990
<v Speaker 3>them to see people do that.</v>

431
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:46.830
<v Speaker 3>We knew that with hockey,</v>

432
00:18:46.831 --> 00:18:48.090
<v Speaker 3>we do that with soccer,</v>

433
00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:49.680
<v Speaker 3>baseball,</v>

434
00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:50.763
<v Speaker 3>basketball,</v>

435
00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:54.900
<v Speaker 3>like the idea of specifying a target and the hitting the center of it or</v>

436
00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:59.780
<v Speaker 3>something that we're absolutely obsessed about that we're so obsessed that</v>

437
00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:02.850
<v Speaker 3>together together new stadiums and watch people do it.</v>

438
00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:05.990
<v Speaker 3>It's only for reading,</v>

439
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.290
<v Speaker 3>contemplating what we're doing.</v>

440
00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:10.170
<v Speaker 3>Do you see as a sports team,</v>

441
00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:10.501
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

442
00:19:10.501 --> 00:19:15.501
<v Speaker 3>it's a cooperative and competitive attachment to specify and hit a target and</v>

443
00:19:17.971 --> 00:19:21.120
<v Speaker 3>we're so excited about that probably because at least in part,</v>

444
00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:25.470
<v Speaker 3>we're built physiologically on a hunting platform and then throwing platform,</v>

445
00:19:25.471 --> 00:19:25.650
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

446
00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:30.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean human beings can throat and we can throw a punch or throw a ball and</v>

447
00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:31.590
<v Speaker 3>throw a spear.</v>

448
00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:32.700
<v Speaker 3>And that's a big deal.</v>

449
00:19:32.701 --> 00:19:34.290
<v Speaker 3>That's a big part of what we are.</v>

450
00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:36.840
<v Speaker 3>So we're target seeking creatures.</v>

451
00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:40.330
<v Speaker 3>And so it'd be precise in your speeches to specify the target with the</v>

452
00:19:40.331 --> 00:19:40.820
<v Speaker 3>specified.</v>

453
00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:44.640
<v Speaker 3>The target is to have an aim and to have an aim is to have a purpose and to aid</v>

454
00:19:44.641 --> 00:19:46.890
<v Speaker 3>property institute attain your purpose,</v>

455
00:19:46.891 --> 00:19:48.210
<v Speaker 3>at least in principle.</v>

456
00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:51.000
<v Speaker 3>And so partly what we're doing in the future,</v>

457
00:19:51.001 --> 00:19:56.001
<v Speaker 3>authoring Hams and sizes to specify your purpose with your precise speech.</v>

458
00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.240
<v Speaker 3>And so we asked people to,</v>

459
00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:02.700
<v Speaker 3>well here's another thing to contemplate.</v>

460
00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:05.730
<v Speaker 3>We are Amy creatures.</v>

461
00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:07.710
<v Speaker 3>We're built on hunting platform.</v>

462
00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.890
<v Speaker 3>We'd like to hit targets as possible that we're good at it.</v>

463
00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:13.740
<v Speaker 3>And then what that also means is that well,</v>

464
00:20:13.741 --> 00:20:16.620
<v Speaker 3>if we aren't good at it and that's part of what we are,</v>

465
00:20:16.621 --> 00:20:20.200
<v Speaker 3>then if you specify a target and you might be headed,</v>

466
00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.860
<v Speaker 3>and that's a hell of a thing.</v>

467
00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:23.280
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>

468
00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.960
<v Speaker 3>there's a statement in the New Testament,</v>

469
00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:28.020
<v Speaker 3>it's quite a strange statement and it's a,</v>

470
00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:28.860
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

471
00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:32.490
<v Speaker 3>it's a suggestion in the suggestion is that if you knock,</v>

472
00:20:32.491 --> 00:20:34.380
<v Speaker 3>the door will open and if you ask,</v>

473
00:20:34.381 --> 00:20:36.540
<v Speaker 3>you will receive a new thing.</v>

474
00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:41.040
<v Speaker 3>Well that seems highly unlikely and well it does seem highly unlikely,</v>

475
00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:41.520
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

476
00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.680
<v Speaker 3>Being sure that's the way the world is set up.</v>

477
00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:44.011
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

478
00:20:44.011 --> 00:20:44.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

479
00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:45.570
<v Speaker 3>that is our school,</v>

480
00:20:45.571 --> 00:20:46.890
<v Speaker 3>the way the world is set up,</v>

481
00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:48.810
<v Speaker 3>it's a very strange thing and it's,</v>

482
00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:51.760
<v Speaker 3>it's not that surprising if you started thinking it through.</v>

483
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.930
<v Speaker 3>And so that mean after all,</v>

484
00:20:52.931 --> 00:20:56.830
<v Speaker 3>prophetically through adapting to the moral evolution has been working three and</v>

485
00:20:56.831 --> 00:20:59.500
<v Speaker 3>a half billion years to produce you.</v>

486
00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:00.400
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

487
00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

488
00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:02.650
<v Speaker 3>they could've done a better job,</v>

489
00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:06.790
<v Speaker 3>but that's not such a bad job.</v>

490
00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:09.600
<v Speaker 3>And so maybe she could attain your aim.</v>

491
00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:12.910
<v Speaker 3>One of the things I've certainly learned as a clinical psychologist once that a</v>

492
00:21:12.911 --> 00:21:17.911
<v Speaker 3>lot of the people that I saw who were unhappy with their lives say new forties</v>

493
00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:23.440
<v Speaker 3>and sometimes you're be within that and who had him detained what they wanted</v>

494
00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:28.120
<v Speaker 3>haven't attained in often in large part because the never specified and the</v>

495
00:21:28.121 --> 00:21:33.121
<v Speaker 3>probability that you're going to hit a tiny target precisely without aiming at</v>

496
00:21:34.091 --> 00:21:35.650
<v Speaker 3>it is zero.</v>

497
00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:38.260
<v Speaker 3>That's not gonna happen so well.</v>

498
00:21:38.261 --> 00:21:41.190
<v Speaker 3>So what would happen if you would aim at it?</v>

499
00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:43.960
<v Speaker 3>That's a question and how it should be fast aim.</v>

500
00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:45.100
<v Speaker 3>That's another question.</v>

501
00:21:45.101 --> 00:21:46.060
<v Speaker 3>And that's part of what,</v>

502
00:21:46.061 --> 00:21:48.490
<v Speaker 3>12 rules for lights and it's about,</v>

503
00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:49.960
<v Speaker 3>the second rule for example,</v>

504
00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:54.250
<v Speaker 3>is a treat yourself like you're someone responsible for helping.</v>

505
00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:55.740
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of a nice start.</v>

506
00:21:55.741 --> 00:21:59.260
<v Speaker 3>So I could imagine edge and that again is you're aiming a rifle.</v>

507
00:21:59.261 --> 00:22:02.230
<v Speaker 3>You have to put yourself in a certain physiological state,</v>

508
00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:02.860
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

509
00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:03.160
<v Speaker 3>What I'm,</v>

510
00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:06.280
<v Speaker 3>take some deep breaths and calm down and you want to make sure your hands are</v>

511
00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:08.050
<v Speaker 3>shaking and jiggling and so forth.</v>

512
00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:08.860
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

513
00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:11.110
<v Speaker 3>put yourself in the right frame of mind.</v>

514
00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:12.940
<v Speaker 3>And if you're going to take eight with your life,</v>

515
00:22:12.941 --> 00:22:13.900
<v Speaker 3>it's the same thing.</v>

516
00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:17.590
<v Speaker 3>You have to put yourself in the right frame of mind and what's the right frame</v>

517
00:22:17.591 --> 00:22:17.980
<v Speaker 3>of mind.</v>

518
00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:19.030
<v Speaker 3>And it might be something like,</v>

519
00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:23.830
<v Speaker 3>while you can assume that you're actually hypothetically a valuable creature,</v>

520
00:22:23.831 --> 00:22:25.880
<v Speaker 3>even though you might not think that self is,</v>

521
00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:30.180
<v Speaker 3>you're absolutely knowing what the bull about your own flaws and insufficiencies</v>

522
00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:32.140
<v Speaker 3>but independent of value,</v>

523
00:22:32.141 --> 00:22:32.681
<v Speaker 3>you might think,</v>

524
00:22:32.681 --> 00:22:37.060
<v Speaker 3>well you can lend your sofa hand and you can do something good for yourself just</v>

525
00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:38.800
<v Speaker 3>up with the goodness of your heart.</v>

526
00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:39.101
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

527
00:22:39.101 --> 00:22:42.580
<v Speaker 3>like you might do for someone that you cared about.</v>

528
00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:45.100
<v Speaker 3>Now that that's actually very difficult for people.</v>

529
00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:45.750
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

530
00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:48.430
<v Speaker 3>like most of us love someone or a couple of people,</v>

531
00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:51.620
<v Speaker 3>but just half heartedly at least observe children.</v>

532
00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:52.090
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

533
00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:52.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

534
00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:54.580
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to be fully committed to something.</v>

535
00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:55.770
<v Speaker 3>But in generally way,</v>

536
00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:58.260
<v Speaker 3>generally we do a pretty good job with our,</v>

537
00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:02.830
<v Speaker 3>with our partners or husbands and wives and a pretty good job with her children.</v>

538
00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:02.980
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

539
00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:04.370
<v Speaker 3>it's a little more iffy there.</v>

540
00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:05.483
<v Speaker 3>A decent job,</v>

541
00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:06.910
<v Speaker 3>parents,</v>

542
00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:07.091
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

543
00:23:07.091 --> 00:23:08.800
<v Speaker 3>you know it's 70 30 or whatever,</v>

544
00:23:08.801 --> 00:23:10.260
<v Speaker 3>but maybe you could make,</v>

545
00:23:10.261 --> 00:23:12.700
<v Speaker 3>you can elevate elevated more than that with a lot of aspirin,</v>

546
00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:16.030
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know how good we are about doing that for ourselves.</v>

547
00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:17.890
<v Speaker 3>I would say much less so.</v>

548
00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:21.970
<v Speaker 3>And part of that is definitely the fact that we're very aware of our own flaws</v>

549
00:23:21.971 --> 00:23:25.740
<v Speaker 3>and insufficiencies personally you know more about how Regine useless.</v>

550
00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:28.840
<v Speaker 3>You are fundamentally then about anyone else.</v>

551
00:23:28.841 --> 00:23:33.841
<v Speaker 3>And so that's rather disheartening given that it's disheartening then it's not</v>

552
00:23:33.881 --> 00:23:35.710
<v Speaker 3>so easy to take care of yourself properly,</v>

553
00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:40.210
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't go up his to be that you really have to have that right not to</v>

554
00:23:40.211 --> 00:23:41.230
<v Speaker 3>take care of yourself.</v>

555
00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:46.160
<v Speaker 3>I think you have a responsibility to take care of yourself as if something</v>

556
00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:49.070
<v Speaker 1>value which you are.</v>

557
00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:52.070
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a responsibility.</v>

558
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:56.610
<v Speaker 1>And so when you fill out a future authoring program here,</v>

559
00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:01.680
<v Speaker 1>you're asked to adopt for the sake of experimentation,</v>

560
00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:05.480
<v Speaker 1>the frame of reference,</v>

561
00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:10.570
<v Speaker 1>a frame of reference within which you give yourself the benefit of the doubt and</v>

562
00:24:10.791 --> 00:24:14.360
<v Speaker 1>assume that there's something about you that might be usefully be brought</v>

563
00:24:14.361 --> 00:24:15.680
<v Speaker 1>forward into the world.</v>

564
00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:17.390
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

565
00:24:17.391 --> 00:24:17.661
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

566
00:24:17.661 --> 00:24:18.494
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

567
00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:24.220
<v Speaker 1>an axiom of our society that there is something about you that would be usefully</v>

568
00:24:24.361 --> 00:24:28.130
<v Speaker 1>be brought forward into the world because our whole society is predicated on the</v>

569
00:24:28.131 --> 00:24:32.840
<v Speaker 1>notion of the sovereign individual there even enough and the divided and we</v>

570
00:24:32.841 --> 00:24:34.220
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't have,</v>

571
00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:35.563
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

572
00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:39.830
<v Speaker 1>exceeded political power each and every one of us if,</v>

573
00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:44.840
<v Speaker 1>and that would work unless there was actually something to the proposition that</v>

574
00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:50.080
<v Speaker 1>each individual is in fact something approximating and divide locus of value</v>

575
00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:52.790
<v Speaker 1>despite our insufficiencies.</v>

576
00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:57.850
<v Speaker 1>And so allowing yourself the benefit of the doubt seems like and philosophically</v>

577
00:24:58.341 --> 00:25:02.480
<v Speaker 1>appropriate thing and it takes a certain month love and it takes a certain</v>

578
00:25:02.481 --> 00:25:03.314
<v Speaker 1>amount of courage.</v>

579
00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.630
<v Speaker 1>And so we ask people to think,</v>

580
00:25:05.631 --> 00:25:05.931
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

581
00:25:05.931 --> 00:25:06.711
<v Speaker 1>well here,</v>

582
00:25:06.711 --> 00:25:07.700
<v Speaker 1>here's a game.</v>

583
00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:10.600
<v Speaker 1>You can have it if you ain't mad</v>

584
00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.300
<v Speaker 1>possibility.</v>

585
00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:15.910
<v Speaker 1>If you aim it a proper,</v>

586
00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:17.060
<v Speaker 1>and would that make sense?</v>

587
00:25:17.061 --> 00:25:18.590
<v Speaker 1>Because if you ain't been something in property,</v>

588
00:25:18.591 --> 00:25:19.371
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to hit it.</v>

589
00:25:19.371 --> 00:25:21.830
<v Speaker 1>So you could have it and you can hit when you a map.</v>

590
00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:22.760
<v Speaker 1>If you a property.</v>

591
00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:24.860
<v Speaker 1>The question would be how when you,</v>

592
00:25:24.861 --> 00:25:26.600
<v Speaker 1>a proper answer might be,</v>

593
00:25:26.601 --> 00:25:31.120
<v Speaker 1>well imagine you just started to take care of yourself like he was something.</v>

594
00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:32.240
<v Speaker 1>We're thinking carer.</v>

595
00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:34.700
<v Speaker 1>So then you could say,</v>

596
00:25:34.701 --> 00:25:35.534
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

597
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:38.360
<v Speaker 1>if you could have what you wanted three to five years down the room,</v>

598
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:40.550
<v Speaker 1>what would it be?</v>

599
00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:41.450
<v Speaker 1>One of the needed,</v>

600
00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:43.010
<v Speaker 1>assuming you were taking care of yourself.</v>

601
00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:43.870
<v Speaker 1>Like if you,</v>

602
00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:44.920
<v Speaker 1>if you can think about it like you,</v>

603
00:25:44.921 --> 00:25:46.400
<v Speaker 1>I take care of the child.</v>

604
00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:48.110
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to take care of a child,</v>

605
00:25:48.111 --> 00:25:50.690
<v Speaker 1>he wouldn't just grant him or her,</v>

606
00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:52.970
<v Speaker 1>his or her every win.</v>

607
00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:54.410
<v Speaker 1>That's not care.</v>

608
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:56.870
<v Speaker 1>So that isn't how you can treat yourself.</v>

609
00:25:57.250 --> 00:25:58.460
<v Speaker 1>You have to be more sensible.</v>

610
00:25:58.580 --> 00:25:59.331
<v Speaker 1>How we can say,</v>

611
00:25:59.331 --> 00:25:59.750
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

612
00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:00.021
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

613
00:26:00.021 --> 00:26:03.110
<v Speaker 1>you mean you get to have what you need three to five years down the road?</v>

614
00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:04.390
<v Speaker 1>What do you want from your family?</v>

615
00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:07.670
<v Speaker 1>If you could put your family together the way you wanted it to be together.</v>

616
00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:08.160
<v Speaker 1>So you had,</v>

617
00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:11.360
<v Speaker 1>what do you want it from your father and your mother and your siblings and your</v>

618
00:26:11.361 --> 00:26:12.110
<v Speaker 1>kids,</v>

619
00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:13.310
<v Speaker 1>just hypothetically,</v>

620
00:26:13.311 --> 00:26:14.300
<v Speaker 1>what would that look like?</v>

621
00:26:14.301 --> 00:26:17.090
<v Speaker 1>It probably wouldn't look like the situation where you're all around the</v>

622
00:26:17.091 --> 00:26:19.430
<v Speaker 1>Thanksgiving dinner with your hands around each other's necks,</v>

623
00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:20.870
<v Speaker 1>squeezing slowly,</v>

624
00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:25.940
<v Speaker 1>which is the condition many families are in that Thanksgiving dinner.</v>

625
00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:30.190
<v Speaker 1>You probably wouldn't wish for that and it would probably not be for the basket.</v>

626
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:31.303
<v Speaker 1>Then you might ask,</v>

627
00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:32.181
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

628
00:26:32.181 --> 00:26:33.800
<v Speaker 1>what would you want from your,</v>

629
00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:35.690
<v Speaker 1>from your intimate partner,</v>

630
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:37.550
<v Speaker 1>if you could have what you needed,</v>

631
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:40.430
<v Speaker 1>what would you want from your career?</v>

632
00:26:40.431 --> 00:26:42.830
<v Speaker 1>And how would you educate yourself if you could do,</v>

633
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:48.480
<v Speaker 1>we did an auditable way or at least better trends you're managing now.</v>

634
00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:50.730
<v Speaker 1>How would you take care of your mental and physical health?</v>

635
00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:54.720
<v Speaker 1>What would you do outside of work that would be meaningful and engaging in</v>

636
00:26:54.721 --> 00:26:55.590
<v Speaker 1>productive?</v>

637
00:26:56.030 --> 00:26:56.863
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

638
00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:00.810
<v Speaker 1>what do you want from your friends?</v>

639
00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:01.620
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

640
00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:02.650
<v Speaker 1>that's cool.</v>

641
00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:07.410
<v Speaker 1>Three and 12 for like make friends with the people who want the best for him.</v>

642
00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:08.961
<v Speaker 1>I'd say help.</v>

643
00:27:08.961 --> 00:27:11.280
<v Speaker 1>I think to do that'd be useful.</v>

644
00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:11.821
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

645
00:27:11.821 --> 00:27:16.020
<v Speaker 1>cause it's not that easy to do what's best even though it's batched to do what's</v>

646
00:27:16.021 --> 00:27:17.370
<v Speaker 1>best by definition.</v>

647
00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:21.870
<v Speaker 1>It could be useful perhaps to be surrounded by people who are happy when</v>

648
00:27:21.871 --> 00:27:23.130
<v Speaker 1>something good happens to you,</v>

649
00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:28.490
<v Speaker 1>genuinely plates because they know that life is bigger than short and tragic and</v>

650
00:27:28.801 --> 00:27:32.820
<v Speaker 1>then the probability that good things will happen to people is somewhat low.</v>

651
00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:35.370
<v Speaker 1>And then as a consequence of when they do,</v>

652
00:27:35.371 --> 00:27:39.600
<v Speaker 1>it's something to celebrate and who had also perhaps be not so happy if</v>

653
00:27:39.601 --> 00:27:43.950
<v Speaker 1>something bad happened around you and wouldn't necessarily entice you into such</v>

654
00:27:43.951 --> 00:27:44.910
<v Speaker 1>situations.</v>

655
00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:48.390
<v Speaker 1>So that would be a good thing to consider with regards to your friends.</v>

656
00:27:48.391 --> 00:27:53.391
<v Speaker 1>So there's seven things that you think about how to put your life in the kind of</v>

657
00:27:53.881 --> 00:27:56.910
<v Speaker 1>order that would make you actually want to have your rights to not be bitter</v>

658
00:27:56.911 --> 00:27:57.744
<v Speaker 1>about different</v>

659
00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:02.000
<v Speaker 1>and degenerate because of that bitterness.</v>

660
00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:07.430
<v Speaker 1>And then we asked people to write for 15 minutes sale and you get to have one,</v>

661
00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:09.180
<v Speaker 1>which is your life to look like.</v>

662
00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:11.380
<v Speaker 1>And so that would be life.</v>

663
00:28:11.381 --> 00:28:16.381
<v Speaker 1>That fine maximally except let's say,</v>

664
00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:17.850
<v Speaker 1>but realistically,</v>

665
00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:21.700
<v Speaker 1>and so then you have some name out there.</v>

666
00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:23.200
<v Speaker 1>We had to Ms. Hampton,</v>

667
00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:27.810
<v Speaker 1>we've worked on the program for awhile and we had people write for 15 minutes</v>

668
00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:28.740
<v Speaker 1>count provision,</v>

669
00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:29.820
<v Speaker 1>which was okay.</v>

670
00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:32.390
<v Speaker 1>That's where you're headed and you're aiming for,</v>

671
00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:34.840
<v Speaker 1>you're aiming at him kind of fleshing out.</v>

672
00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:38.580
<v Speaker 1>Here's another useful thing you think about.</v>

673
00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:44.360
<v Speaker 1>So you have that habits and you're resentful book things and you don't try as</v>

674
00:28:45.211 --> 00:28:49.650
<v Speaker 1>hard as it might in some dimensions of your weaknesses that might take you a</v>

675
00:28:49.651 --> 00:28:50.430
<v Speaker 1>partner.</v>

676
00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:53.070
<v Speaker 1>Pretty much everybody knows what those weaknesses are.</v>

677
00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:53.311
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

678
00:28:53.311 --> 00:28:57.000
<v Speaker 1>some people would smoke too much pot and some people would drink too much and</v>

679
00:28:57.001 --> 00:28:59.450
<v Speaker 1>some people would be unfaithful.</v>

680
00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.590
<v Speaker 1>Half counterproductive isn't it?</v>

681
00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:06.650
<v Speaker 1>Some people would end up on the street because they would teach,</v>

682
00:29:06.731 --> 00:29:08.280
<v Speaker 1>generate with regards to the discipline,</v>

683
00:29:08.281 --> 00:29:12.630
<v Speaker 1>everybody kind of knows how they fall apart if they felt apart in their own</v>

684
00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:15.120
<v Speaker 1>idiosyncratic and spectacular manner.</v>

685
00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:17.450
<v Speaker 1>It was the sorts of things that keep you awake at night.</v>

686
00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:18.170
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

687
00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:20.670
<v Speaker 1>if you contemplate them deeply,</v>

688
00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:22.133
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

689
00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:23.880
<v Speaker 1>where would you be in three to five years?</v>

690
00:29:23.881 --> 00:29:26.070
<v Speaker 1>If you let everything go directly to hell,</v>

691
00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:28.290
<v Speaker 1>that's useful.</v>

692
00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.890
<v Speaker 1>That's useful because then see,</v>

693
00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:35.760
<v Speaker 1>it's one thing to motivate yourself because you see that what you're doing is</v>

694
00:29:35.761 --> 00:29:37.560
<v Speaker 1>moving you ahead to something that you want,</v>

695
00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:41.160
<v Speaker 1>but that's hope and hope is a powerful</v>

696
00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:44.340
<v Speaker 3>terror.</v>

697
00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:46.083
<v Speaker 3>That's</v>

698
00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:50.260
<v Speaker 3>one of the things I have to deal with.</v>

699
00:29:50.261 --> 00:29:52.020
<v Speaker 3>One clinical sciences there.</v>

700
00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:53.680
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they don't have a job.</v>

701
00:29:53.681 --> 00:29:54.610
<v Speaker 3>They really like,</v>

702
00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:55.613
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

703
00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:59.010
<v Speaker 3>and it's grinding away at your soul and it's not,</v>

704
00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:01.510
<v Speaker 3>I can just leap out of your job into another job.</v>

705
00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:03.310
<v Speaker 3>That's actually really complicated problem,</v>

706
00:30:03.311 --> 00:30:03.461
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

707
00:30:03.461 --> 00:30:04.330
<v Speaker 3>If you don't like your job,</v>

708
00:30:04.331 --> 00:30:06.460
<v Speaker 3>it's not just a psychological problem.</v>

709
00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:08.020
<v Speaker 3>You have to have a job,</v>

710
00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:09.330
<v Speaker 3>otherwise you died.</v>

711
00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:10.233
<v Speaker 3>And so it's</v>

712
00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:13.461
<v Speaker 3>changing.</v>

713
00:30:13.461 --> 00:30:15.770
<v Speaker 3>Jobs is the bathroom and just adjusting itself.</v>

714
00:30:15.771 --> 00:30:16.760
<v Speaker 3>Psychologically,</v>

715
00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:19.760
<v Speaker 3>you might have to do a lot of planning to change your job.</v>

716
00:30:19.761 --> 00:30:23.120
<v Speaker 3>You have to update your CV if you have to update your skills and maybe we've got</v>

717
00:30:23.121 --> 00:30:27.080
<v Speaker 3>to figure out how to be a little bit more credible in an interview and you have</v>

718
00:30:27.081 --> 00:30:28.670
<v Speaker 3>to overcome your fear of rejection.</v>

719
00:30:28.671 --> 00:30:30.110
<v Speaker 3>Like there may be all sorts of things.</v>

720
00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:30.591
<v Speaker 3>African,</v>

721
00:30:30.591 --> 00:30:35.210
<v Speaker 3>we actually save yourself up to move laterally or up to let's say to a different</v>

722
00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:38.570
<v Speaker 3>position when it's more engaging and uh,</v>

723
00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:40.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

724
00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:41.203
<v Speaker 3>you might be,</v>

725
00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:43.250
<v Speaker 3>you might be looking to do that.</v>

726
00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:44.243
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

727
00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:53.420
<v Speaker 3>And so you're afraid of getting down</v>

728
00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:57.091
<v Speaker 3>and you think,</v>

729
00:30:57.091 --> 00:30:57.211
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

730
00:30:57.211 --> 00:30:58.000
<v Speaker 3>if I'm afraid of it,</v>

731
00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.190
<v Speaker 3>why should I do it?</v>

732
00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:03.270
<v Speaker 3>People ask themselves the same question when they have a difficult conversation</v>

733
00:31:03.271 --> 00:31:06.420
<v Speaker 3>to have with their wives or their children or their parents.</v>

734
00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:06.901
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

735
00:31:06.901 --> 00:31:08.970
<v Speaker 3>cause a lot of us are very conflict diverse.</v>

736
00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:11.970
<v Speaker 3>There are difficult conversations to happen public.</v>

737
00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:14.590
<v Speaker 3>And the reason is is because they're awkward.</v>

738
00:31:14.591 --> 00:31:16.200
<v Speaker 3>Did and make us afraid.</v>

739
00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:17.370
<v Speaker 3>So you might think,</v>

740
00:31:17.371 --> 00:31:17.521
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

741
00:31:17.521 --> 00:31:19.560
<v Speaker 3>why the hell bothered if it makes you afraid?</v>

742
00:31:19.561 --> 00:31:21.030
<v Speaker 3>Why not just not do it?</v>

743
00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:26.210
<v Speaker 3>Which is one of the ideas that keeps people in jobs they hate and in</v>

744
00:31:26.281 --> 00:31:30.600
<v Speaker 3>relationships and stopped him from repairing their relationships with you.</v>

745
00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:33.420
<v Speaker 3>It's a very difficult thing to do and that's what it is.</v>

746
00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:34.853
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

747
00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:39.920
<v Speaker 3>let's imagine that you could just keep doing the thing that you don't like them.</v>

748
00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.360
<v Speaker 3>You don't change it because you're afraid to,</v>

749
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:44.011
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

750
00:31:44.011 --> 00:31:46.080
<v Speaker 3>are you afraid of what happens if you don't change it?</v>

751
00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:48.610
<v Speaker 3>And if you lay out this little hell,</v>

752
00:31:48.611 --> 00:31:53.611
<v Speaker 3>but I described really in one way so you know where you in degenerating if you</v>

753
00:31:54.061 --> 00:31:57.200
<v Speaker 3>were going to degenerate and then you look at your life and can take,</v>

754
00:31:57.210 --> 00:32:01.730
<v Speaker 3>well here's a bunch of things I'm not doing because I'm afraid not s you know,</v>

755
00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:02.670
<v Speaker 3>keeping me secure.</v>

756
00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:03.091
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

757
00:32:03.091 --> 00:32:03.271
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

758
00:32:03.271 --> 00:32:03.990
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>

759
00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:06.570
<v Speaker 3>It's just taking you to that place that you lay down.</v>

760
00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:08.100
<v Speaker 3>It's an absolute catastrophe.</v>

761
00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:13.610
<v Speaker 3>And so sometimes the answer to why should I do this thing that I'd been putting</v>

762
00:32:13.861 --> 00:32:17.920
<v Speaker 3>off is well otherwise they end up in this particular hell.</v>

763
00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:19.830
<v Speaker 3>I already know.</v>

764
00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:21.430
<v Speaker 3>I already know the parameters of it.</v>

765
00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:24.300
<v Speaker 3>And so hope can help you move out of that.</v>

766
00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:25.920
<v Speaker 3>It would be better if I did this,</v>

767
00:32:25.921 --> 00:32:30.921
<v Speaker 3>but fear of not doing it and the consequences as we've been and what's better</v>

768
00:32:32.011 --> 00:32:34.260
<v Speaker 3>yet is to have both of the working in tandem.</v>

769
00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:37.620
<v Speaker 3>So psychologists figured this out when they were looking at theory years ago</v>

770
00:32:37.621 --> 00:32:40.170
<v Speaker 3>because I'm trying to figure out how to motivate our members</v>

771
00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:44.190
<v Speaker 1>to do things like run down a nice update,</v>

772
00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:45.053
<v Speaker 1>a reward.</v>

773
00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:46.310
<v Speaker 1>Turns out that a hungry,</v>

774
00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:46.970
<v Speaker 1>hungry,</v>

775
00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:48.590
<v Speaker 1>wrapping down a little maze,</v>

776
00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:51.800
<v Speaker 1>right rapidly get a piece of cheese by the answer.</v>

777
00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:53.023
<v Speaker 1>That rat,</v>

778
00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:58.940
<v Speaker 1>if you have the hungry rata and you walk in some catheter as pets are terrified</v>

779
00:32:59.841 --> 00:33:00.650
<v Speaker 1>as counts.</v>

780
00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:04.160
<v Speaker 1>It reads like to even just say from different Medicap had just a different smell</v>

781
00:33:04.161 --> 00:33:04.970
<v Speaker 1>than couch.</v>

782
00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:07.270
<v Speaker 1>They know what cat smell like and don't like it.</v>

783
00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:10.910
<v Speaker 1>So if you take your hungry rather throwing little caterpillars,</v>

784
00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:13.820
<v Speaker 1>he'll sit down that runway like nat,</v>

785
00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:16.220
<v Speaker 1>much faster than women's just hungry.</v>

786
00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:20.390
<v Speaker 1>So running away from something that you're terrified element,</v>

787
00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:24.350
<v Speaker 1>avoiding something that your property being terrified of and running towards</v>

788
00:33:24.351 --> 00:33:26.130
<v Speaker 1>something you want is a good way of being knocked.</v>

789
00:33:26.131 --> 00:33:26.964
<v Speaker 1>Somebody motivated.</v>

790
00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:29.300
<v Speaker 1>And so at the second part of that program,</v>

791
00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:31.670
<v Speaker 1>we have people,</v>

792
00:33:31.671 --> 00:33:35.930
<v Speaker 1>they hold a very detailed plan about their,</v>

793
00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:42.720
<v Speaker 1>and if the eagles prior code schools figuring out why would you like to be</v>

794
00:33:43.161 --> 00:33:45.710
<v Speaker 1>better because he would take the first school,</v>

795
00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:46.780
<v Speaker 1>how would your family's,</v>

796
00:33:46.781 --> 00:33:48.770
<v Speaker 1>which to be better also with baby,</v>

797
00:33:48.771 --> 00:33:52.310
<v Speaker 1>how would you be of more benefit to the community if you would take that book?</v>

798
00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:56.300
<v Speaker 1>Cause it'd be nice if you could sort yourself out in ways that also sorted out</v>

799
00:33:56.301 --> 00:34:00.120
<v Speaker 1>your family and then also sorted out in your community and since you're making</v>

800
00:34:00.121 --> 00:34:00.620
<v Speaker 1>an implant,</v>

801
00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:02.690
<v Speaker 1>but where the hell no name for all three,</v>

802
00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.340
<v Speaker 1>it's more sustainable anyways.</v>

803
00:34:04.341 --> 00:34:05.120
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

804
00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:10.120
<v Speaker 1>So throw the famous psychologist show Piaget called celebrated state.</v>

805
00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:14.770
<v Speaker 1>He says that it's like a game that everyone wants to play.</v>

806
00:34:14.930 --> 00:34:17.840
<v Speaker 1>It's better if you're going to play a game to play a game that everyone wants to</v>

807
00:34:17.841 --> 00:34:20.140
<v Speaker 1>play with it and that's a good,</v>

808
00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:22.010
<v Speaker 1>that's a good indication that it's a good game.</v>

809
00:34:22.011 --> 00:34:24.950
<v Speaker 1>And so if you could figure out how to fix yourself up in a way that we had</v>

810
00:34:24.951 --> 00:34:27.380
<v Speaker 1>similar opinions to fix up your family and your community,</v>

811
00:34:27.381 --> 00:34:28.214
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

812
00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:29.353
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

813
00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:35.660
<v Speaker 1>everybody wins and maybe it would be good to play game the different liquids.</v>

814
00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:38.420
<v Speaker 1>So we don't think of games that way.</v>

815
00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:39.051
<v Speaker 1>Pretty awful,</v>

816
00:34:39.051 --> 00:34:44.051
<v Speaker 1>but it's certainly possible getting joint that exist and so well courage and</v>

817
00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:48.050
<v Speaker 1>that free speech.</v>

818
00:34:48.051 --> 00:34:51.950
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I do recommend that people who try these programs is that</v>

819
00:34:51.951 --> 00:34:56.951
<v Speaker 1>they do the that because if that plan has been that the no plan at all and</v>

820
00:34:57.021 --> 00:34:59.820
<v Speaker 1>you're going to come up with a better plan because what they haven't,</v>

821
00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:00.693
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

822
00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:05.990
<v Speaker 1>and so it's either a bad glad knows lab and no glamor is way worse instead of</v>

823
00:35:07.071 --> 00:35:07.904
<v Speaker 1>that plan.</v>

824
00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:11.540
<v Speaker 1>At least when you implemented that plan and you serve walking towards what the</v>

825
00:35:11.541 --> 00:35:12.374
<v Speaker 1>plan is,</v>

826
00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:16.940
<v Speaker 1>you'll see specifically where it is that you're an error like specifically.</v>

827
00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:21.320
<v Speaker 1>And you'll learn from that and then you can use what you learn while you're</v>

828
00:35:21.321 --> 00:35:22.520
<v Speaker 1>making the mistakes,</v>

829
00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:25.730
<v Speaker 1>implementing your bad plan to make a better plan.</v>

830
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:27.560
<v Speaker 1>And if you keep doing that eventually,</v>

831
00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:29.100
<v Speaker 1>like there'll be a lot of failure along the way.</v>

832
00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:31.430
<v Speaker 1>That's the adventure of your life by the way.</v>

833
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:36.830
<v Speaker 1>If you do that and you keep laying on plan and learning painterly from your</v>

834
00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:39.060
<v Speaker 1>failures and then directing the planet,</v>

835
00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:44.120
<v Speaker 1>what'll happen is you get on target as you move through life and even though</v>

836
00:35:46.171 --> 00:35:48.540
<v Speaker 1>you're hitting a moving target because life is complicated.</v>

837
00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:51.290
<v Speaker 1>And so we have some,</v>

838
00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:55.950
<v Speaker 1>cause we studied this site didn't make weight because we weren't convinced our</v>

839
00:35:55.951 --> 00:35:58.110
<v Speaker 1>theories were necessarily accurate.</v>

840
00:35:58.170 --> 00:35:58.720
<v Speaker 1>We found,</v>

841
00:35:58.720 --> 00:35:59.553
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

842
00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:02.620
<v Speaker 1>this was at Mohawk College Ontario.</v>

843
00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:04.153
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

844
00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:08.390
<v Speaker 1>people who get to the future authoring program before they went to college work.</v>

845
00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:10.020
<v Speaker 1>The young men in particular,</v>

846
00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:14.310
<v Speaker 1>especially the English young man sort of categorize the people who were pursuing</v>

847
00:36:14.311 --> 00:36:19.311
<v Speaker 1>something that was career oriented or something sort of vaguely can find the</v>

848
00:36:20.521 --> 00:36:22.550
<v Speaker 1>young men who had vacant triangles goals.</v>

849
00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:24.720
<v Speaker 1>If they did the future authoring program,</v>

850
00:36:24.721 --> 00:36:28.410
<v Speaker 1>they were 50% less likely to drop out of college in the first semester.</v>

851
00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:30.410
<v Speaker 1>So it was quite staggering.</v>

852
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:31.303
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

853
00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:32.551
<v Speaker 1>so it's useful,</v>

854
00:36:32.551 --> 00:36:32.911
<v Speaker 1>David,</v>

855
00:36:32.911 --> 00:36:35.070
<v Speaker 1>something that's the moral of that story.</v>

856
00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:37.320
<v Speaker 1>And so fact the courage,</v>

857
00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:38.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

858
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:39.690
<v Speaker 1>which is where I started.</v>

859
00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:44.780
<v Speaker 1>So originally when psychologists were studying theory,</v>

860
00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:48.150
<v Speaker 1>they assume that fear was something that you learn.</v>

861
00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:51.180
<v Speaker 1>And you might think that because there you are sitting down,</v>

862
00:36:51.210 --> 00:36:51.931
<v Speaker 1>they're pretty calm,</v>

863
00:36:51.931 --> 00:36:52.081
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

864
00:36:52.081 --> 00:36:52.891
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid of anything.</v>

865
00:36:52.891 --> 00:36:57.330
<v Speaker 1>And so you might believe that the normal state of the human being is calm.</v>

866
00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:59.430
<v Speaker 1>And then we have to learn to be afraid.</v>

867
00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:00.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

868
00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:02.610
<v Speaker 1>psychologists could teach animals how to be afraid.</v>

869
00:37:02.611 --> 00:37:04.920
<v Speaker 1>So one way you can teach an animal to be afraid.</v>

870
00:37:04.921 --> 00:37:05.820
<v Speaker 1>This was done with rap,</v>

871
00:37:05.821 --> 00:37:10.821
<v Speaker 1>just have your route and it's in his cage and it's like it's comradery and then</v>

872
00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:16.310
<v Speaker 1>you turn off the light and then you like to Phi this floor a little bit,</v>

873
00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:17.563
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

874
00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:20.730
<v Speaker 1>Cause you wouldn't have the route around for a while.</v>

875
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:25.380
<v Speaker 1>And so just enough to shock and that shock,</v>

876
00:37:25.381 --> 00:37:26.430
<v Speaker 1>that causes pain.</v>

877
00:37:26.431 --> 00:37:29.630
<v Speaker 1>That's a punishment like shocked to wrath.</v>

878
00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:31.280
<v Speaker 1>You do that a few times,</v>

879
00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:34.710
<v Speaker 1>like was on the rent freezes as the bag as hard,</v>

880
00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:39.240
<v Speaker 1>that the light signifies shock and what the Rad is experiencing with the light</v>

881
00:37:39.241 --> 00:37:42.020
<v Speaker 1>goes on his feeling or any title.</v>

882
00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:47.190
<v Speaker 1>And so psychologists get that with tracks and they thought a hot has learned to</v>

883
00:37:47.191 --> 00:37:48.300
<v Speaker 1>be afraid.</v>

884
00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:50.700
<v Speaker 1>That's actually not true.</v>

885
00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:53.220
<v Speaker 1>I'll talk about that while.</v>

886
00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:56.610
<v Speaker 1>And so then they generalize that to human beings.</v>

887
00:37:56.611 --> 00:37:59.430
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe you have a phobia mouse or something like that,</v>

888
00:37:59.431 --> 00:38:00.570
<v Speaker 1>or maybe you're afraid of something.</v>

889
00:38:00.571 --> 00:38:05.220
<v Speaker 1>The idea was while you learn to be afraid and we can teach you how to not be</v>

890
00:38:05.221 --> 00:38:06.054
<v Speaker 1>afraid.</v>

891
00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:09.510
<v Speaker 1>And so what the psychologist at the behavioralists was,</v>

892
00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:10.373
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

893
00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:11.881
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

894
00:38:11.881 --> 00:38:13.680
<v Speaker 1>let's say you were afraid of balloons.</v>

895
00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:15.540
<v Speaker 1>Some people are afraid of balloons.</v>

896
00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:16.433
<v Speaker 1>As it turns out,</v>

897
00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:17.880
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of an absurd fear,</v>

898
00:38:17.881 --> 00:38:18.714
<v Speaker 1>but that's okay.</v>

899
00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:20.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

900
00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:24.990
<v Speaker 1>they with metal and uplifting positive post to the face and they learned to be</v>

901
00:38:24.991 --> 00:38:25.800
<v Speaker 1>afraid.</v>

902
00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:27.750
<v Speaker 1>And so that was conditioning them to learn.</v>

903
00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:32.990
<v Speaker 1>And so what you do is you sit the person down as,</v>

904
00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:33.923
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

905
00:38:34.070 --> 00:38:36.340
<v Speaker 1>you have the do and suicides.</v>

906
00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:38.290
<v Speaker 3>And so they take deep breaths.</v>

907
00:38:38.730 --> 00:38:40.750
<v Speaker 3>You pay attention to different parts of their body,</v>

908
00:38:40.751 --> 00:38:42.040
<v Speaker 3>their feet and ankles,</v>

909
00:38:42.041 --> 00:38:42.800
<v Speaker 3>their knees,</v>

910
00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:43.331
<v Speaker 3>so forth,</v>

911
00:38:43.331 --> 00:38:46.510
<v Speaker 3>all the way up the body and relaxing the muscles and put them in a state of</v>

912
00:38:46.511 --> 00:38:48.700
<v Speaker 3>relaxation or breathing deeply.</v>

913
00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:52.240
<v Speaker 3>And then you have to think about pillows or maybe you show them some balloons or</v>

914
00:38:52.241 --> 00:38:54.360
<v Speaker 3>maybe you feel the whole cab room with cold.</v>

915
00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:55.930
<v Speaker 3>It's flooding by the way,</v>

916
00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:58.150
<v Speaker 3>just to be effective.</v>

917
00:38:58.151 --> 00:39:00.190
<v Speaker 3>If you have to get someone over their fear of balloons,</v>

918
00:39:00.191 --> 00:39:02.410
<v Speaker 3>like right now it's a little drastic.</v>

919
00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:03.191
<v Speaker 3>But anyways,</v>

920
00:39:03.191 --> 00:39:07.100
<v Speaker 3>the point is is that you introduce to the thing a trade tradeoffs.</v>

921
00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:07.871
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

922
00:39:07.871 --> 00:39:10.100
<v Speaker 3>they're relaxed and ideas.</v>

923
00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:11.140
<v Speaker 3>That's counter conditioning.</v>

924
00:39:11.141 --> 00:39:15.280
<v Speaker 3>The idea is that when you can't be relaxed and afraid at the same time,</v>

925
00:39:15.281 --> 00:39:19.250
<v Speaker 3>and so if you can learn to relax in the face of the thing that you're afraid</v>

926
00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:20.480
<v Speaker 3>that you won't be afraid of people,</v>

927
00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:22.510
<v Speaker 3>but then someone knows.</v>

928
00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:23.560
<v Speaker 3>So that's a pretty good in theory,</v>

929
00:39:23.561 --> 00:39:24.400
<v Speaker 3>but it's wrong.</v>

930
00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:25.293
<v Speaker 3>It's a good theory.</v>

931
00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:31.560
<v Speaker 3>Just like the theory of the learn to be afraid actually theories exactly wrong</v>

932
00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:34.060
<v Speaker 3>because you don't want it to be fragrance.</v>

933
00:39:34.570 --> 00:39:35.480
<v Speaker 3>You bloody well know.</v>

934
00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:39.010
<v Speaker 3>What you learn is how to keep the home.</v>

935
00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:41.300
<v Speaker 3>And it turns out if that's even true for,</v>

936
00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:42.143
<v Speaker 3>for wraps,</v>

937
00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:45.610
<v Speaker 3>the psychologist's Jerry Mesh with the experiences,</v>

938
00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:46.330
<v Speaker 3>experiments,</v>

939
00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:49.480
<v Speaker 3>movement question is when you have that normal rap,</v>

940
00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:50.201
<v Speaker 3>you guys think,</v>

941
00:39:50.201 --> 00:39:50.770
<v Speaker 3>well here's the,</v>

942
00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:51.780
<v Speaker 3>and he's in the cage,</v>

943
00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:53.020
<v Speaker 3>he's kind of a home there.</v>

944
00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:55.720
<v Speaker 3>So he's calm and you can teach them how to be afraid of the light.</v>

945
00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:57.660
<v Speaker 3>So when you take the comradery,</v>

946
00:39:57.770 --> 00:39:59.280
<v Speaker 3>it's the normal rap.</v>

947
00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:01.990
<v Speaker 3>It's like then you teach them how to be afraid,</v>

948
00:40:02.290 --> 00:40:06.640
<v Speaker 3>but it's kind of arbitrary when you decided that the rat is normal because if</v>

949
00:40:06.641 --> 00:40:11.641
<v Speaker 3>you take a ride by the tail and say you drop in a new cage,</v>

950
00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.380
<v Speaker 3>when he goes in that medication,</v>

951
00:40:14.410 --> 00:40:16.100
<v Speaker 3>he is not a con man.</v>

952
00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:18.610
<v Speaker 3>He's this sort of route.</v>

953
00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:18.911
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

954
00:40:18.911 --> 00:40:20.530
<v Speaker 3>you guys have brought you guys to chat.</v>

955
00:40:20.531 --> 00:40:23.440
<v Speaker 3>Some of you help such as the scouts,</v>

956
00:40:23.441 --> 00:40:24.370
<v Speaker 3>but anyways,</v>

957
00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:30.320
<v Speaker 3>but some of you have probably move your cap to a new house and cats go like</v>

958
00:40:30.881 --> 00:40:31.510
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

959
00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:35.020
<v Speaker 3>Like your Kevin Holmes and calm cow by cat standards,</v>

960
00:40:35.021 --> 00:40:37.060
<v Speaker 3>which is [inaudible] is</v>

961
00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:40.330
<v Speaker 3>one of the delightful things about the,</v>

962
00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:43.450
<v Speaker 3>and you can scare them to [inaudible].</v>

963
00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:50.080
<v Speaker 3>You know when a captured his hair stands on ams like that,</v>

964
00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:53.180
<v Speaker 3>you know that's the same experience you have when you feel awe,</v>

965
00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:55.780
<v Speaker 3>you know that your hair stands on end.</v>

966
00:40:55.781 --> 00:40:57.040
<v Speaker 3>When you feel all,</v>

967
00:40:57.130 --> 00:40:59.590
<v Speaker 3>it's the same response that an animal has to the Predator.</v>

968
00:41:00.350 --> 00:41:00.580
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

969
00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:01.770
<v Speaker 3>imagine you're like a mountain.</v>

970
00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:03.770
<v Speaker 3>You'd see a title on that.</v>

971
00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:07.440
<v Speaker 3>See your mouse and or 65 scale up the coyotes,</v>

972
00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:10.420
<v Speaker 3>that cow was like 70 feet high.</v>

973
00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:12.540
<v Speaker 3>You saw a 70 foot high titles.</v>

974
00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:18.240
<v Speaker 3>You feel awe [inaudible] most of stuff and it doesn't make that's retired.</v>

975
00:41:25.770 --> 00:41:30.770
<v Speaker 3>That's why they stand sideways to a dance backwards off doctors [inaudible]</v>

976
00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:46.970
<v Speaker 3>it's frozen.</v>

977
00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:50.280
<v Speaker 3>That's a normal graph as far as I'm concerned.</v>

978
00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:52.170
<v Speaker 3>That's frozen wrap.</v>

979
00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:55.010
<v Speaker 3>The thing that's absolutely terrified out of it's fine cause it doesn't know</v>

980
00:41:55.011 --> 00:41:58.480
<v Speaker 3>what the hell it's doing or where it's going or what's going to eat it next.</v>

981
00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:00.140
<v Speaker 3>That's normal.</v>

982
00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:02.870
<v Speaker 3>That's the fear circuit on completely.</v>

983
00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:07.310
<v Speaker 3>That's the standard condition of existence as far as I'm concerned because</v>

984
00:42:07.311 --> 00:42:12.200
<v Speaker 3>existence is character on spike terror and death and the idea that the normal</v>

985
00:42:12.201 --> 00:42:13.670
<v Speaker 3>condition is calm.</v>

986
00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:15.200
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>

987
00:42:15.530 --> 00:42:16.880
<v Speaker 3>That's not true at all.</v>

988
00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:21.620
<v Speaker 3>And so he put a rat in a cage and it's frozen that cause it thinks God only</v>

989
00:42:21.621 --> 00:42:22.880
<v Speaker 3>knows what's here.</v>

990
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:28.750
<v Speaker 3>And then what it does is it's frozen and snips of it and if nothing kills it,</v>

991
00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:35.720
<v Speaker 3>then it seems a little bit more specific and see if there's anything in there</v>

992
00:42:35.721 --> 00:42:38.230
<v Speaker 3>and Kinda cap that would really drive,</v>

993
00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:39.261
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

994
00:42:39.261 --> 00:42:44.261
<v Speaker 3>to drink [inaudible] and see if we can turn that [inaudible] learned almost</v>

995
00:43:05.961 --> 00:43:08.700
<v Speaker 3>everything we know about how the brain works from doing such things.</v>

996
00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:11.120
<v Speaker 3>One scaredy wrapped so</v>

997
00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:17.850
<v Speaker 3>and nothing kills him.</v>

998
00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:18.703
<v Speaker 3>He gets a little gray,</v>

999
00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:24.470
<v Speaker 3>he starts to move around and then we can just explore as the whole damn cage</v>

1000
00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:25.580
<v Speaker 3>every nook and cranny.</v>

1001
00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:28.950
<v Speaker 3>And then if there's nothing there that were killer app,</v>

1002
00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:31.940
<v Speaker 3>then upon now and then you think,</v>

1003
00:43:31.941 --> 00:43:33.170
<v Speaker 3>well that's the normal rap.</v>

1004
00:43:33.171 --> 00:43:33.471
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1005
00:43:33.471 --> 00:43:33.801
<v Speaker 3>well no.</v>

1006
00:43:33.801 --> 00:43:35.330
<v Speaker 3>What is terrified about,</v>

1007
00:43:35.331 --> 00:43:36.430
<v Speaker 3>what's the normal loud?</v>

1008
00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:39.130
<v Speaker 3>The Conrad is the Rathmines that's explored everything.</v>

1009
00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:41.330
<v Speaker 3>It's really useful thing to know.</v>

1010
00:43:41.331 --> 00:43:43.040
<v Speaker 3>It's unbelievably useful thing to know.</v>

1011
00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:43.941
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

1012
00:43:43.941 --> 00:43:46.150
<v Speaker 3>Rats don't generally live by themselves in cages.</v>

1013
00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:50.100
<v Speaker 3>We live in a hierarchy of other undergrads in a social world.</v>

1014
00:43:50.130 --> 00:43:51.260
<v Speaker 3>And so there's sort of like people,</v>

1015
00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:52.633
<v Speaker 3>and so</v>

1016
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:57.320
<v Speaker 3>the reason that you're not terrified out of your skull right now,</v>

1017
00:43:58.190 --> 00:44:03.190
<v Speaker 3>even though you could weave is then you're in a higher repeat with to people who</v>

1018
00:44:03.321 --> 00:44:06.770
<v Speaker 3>basically share your culture is the sheriff.</v>

1019
00:44:06.771 --> 00:44:09.170
<v Speaker 3>Go for sure in your hands and you can predict it.</v>

1020
00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:11.460
<v Speaker 3>You don't know what these primates litmus from within.</v>

1021
00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:13.730
<v Speaker 3>There's probably 2000 people in here.</v>

1022
00:44:13.731 --> 00:44:14.564
<v Speaker 3>There's lease,</v>

1023
00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:20.050
<v Speaker 3>30 of you are seriously the range [inaudible] but everybody's behaving properly</v>

1024
00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:29.020
<v Speaker 3>and everybody's pointed in the same directions.</v>

1025
00:44:29.770 --> 00:44:31.610
<v Speaker 3>One was turned around completely understood.</v>

1026
00:44:31.930 --> 00:44:32.763
<v Speaker 3>See</v>

1027
00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:40.310
<v Speaker 3>what the hell is this Friday not to?</v>

1028
00:44:42.830 --> 00:44:44.160
<v Speaker 3>And we have an agreement here.</v>

1029
00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:47.340
<v Speaker 3>The agreement is everybody sits in their chair and everybody thinks this is the</v>

1030
00:44:47.341 --> 00:44:49.590
<v Speaker 3>front and no one makes too much noise.</v>

1031
00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:49.981
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1032
00:44:49.981 --> 00:44:51.050
<v Speaker 3>wave your elbows around.</v>

1033
00:44:51.051 --> 00:44:54.360
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's a lots of rules and everybody,</v>

1034
00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:56.730
<v Speaker 3>and you were told that's a rule</v>

1035
00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:03.810
<v Speaker 3>and you don't talk a lot to your partner,</v>

1036
00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:04.350
<v Speaker 3>let's say.</v>

1037
00:45:04.350 --> 00:45:08.880
<v Speaker 3>Well the electrodes on and you don't talk to yourself and you're certainly going</v>

1038
00:45:09.610 --> 00:45:11.500
<v Speaker 3>to yourself and hinder your forehead,</v>

1039
00:45:11.850 --> 00:45:12.190
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1040
00:45:12.190 --> 00:45:17.190
<v Speaker 3>So there's lots of rules that are keeping your anxiety circuitry under control</v>

1041
00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:23.900
<v Speaker 3>in this circumstance and everybody around you is being polite enough to act out</v>

1042
00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:28.880
<v Speaker 3>the rules and so your fear stays off.</v>

1043
00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:30.480
<v Speaker 3>And what are the races?</v>

1044
00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:31.460
<v Speaker 3>This is something that was,</v>

1045
00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:34.900
<v Speaker 3>see if it's really important to me when I finally figured out that the comrade</v>

1046
00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:36.030
<v Speaker 3>wasn't the normal map,</v>

1047
00:45:36.350 --> 00:45:39.840
<v Speaker 3>the terrified grab what's been normal lab and then the terrified rab had to</v>

1048
00:45:39.841 --> 00:45:44.040
<v Speaker 3>learn how to be calm and the way that it learns how to be calm was two sports</v>

1049
00:45:44.041 --> 00:45:45.200
<v Speaker 3>territory and buddy,</v>

1050
00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:49.350
<v Speaker 3>but have been natural environment to organize a hierarchy in that territory so</v>

1051
00:45:49.351 --> 00:45:50.131
<v Speaker 3>that every graduate,</v>

1052
00:45:50.131 --> 00:45:50.581
<v Speaker 3>exactly,</v>

1053
00:45:50.581 --> 00:45:54.700
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is every other rep is doing at all times come to a nice wrap</v>

1054
00:45:54.701 --> 00:45:59.070
<v Speaker 3>agreement that's the hierarchy and explore the environment and then they keep</v>

1055
00:45:59.071 --> 00:46:00.570
<v Speaker 3>their terrorist circuits off.</v>

1056
00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:04.200
<v Speaker 3>And the reason that people don't like to have their belief systems disruptive,</v>

1057
00:46:04.730 --> 00:46:09.320
<v Speaker 3>it's because it turns the terrorist circuits back on and no one likes that.</v>

1058
00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:10.710
<v Speaker 3>Not even a bit.</v>

1059
00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:12.990
<v Speaker 3>It's absolutely before a flight.</v>

1060
00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:17.250
<v Speaker 3>And so that's hardly why people are so invested in their belief systems.</v>

1061
00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:22.980
<v Speaker 3>So back to how you treat someone if they're afraid.</v>

1062
00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:27.030
<v Speaker 3>So you flooded with balloons,</v>

1063
00:46:27.031 --> 00:46:30.750
<v Speaker 3>whether they're relaxed and then they're not afraid to moons anyone.</v>

1064
00:46:30.810 --> 00:46:31.680
<v Speaker 3>And that actually works.</v>

1065
00:46:31.681 --> 00:46:33.120
<v Speaker 3>If you do it five or six times,</v>

1066
00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:37.920
<v Speaker 3>then there'll be able to tolerate balloons or mice or needles at a crime.</v>

1067
00:46:37.921 --> 00:46:39.000
<v Speaker 3>If a needle phobia,</v>

1068
00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:44.720
<v Speaker 3>he had a needle phobia that was so severe and he would undergo the surgery.</v>

1069
00:46:44.731 --> 00:46:45.780
<v Speaker 3>There's no anesthetic.</v>

1070
00:46:46.830 --> 00:46:47.371
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1071
00:46:47.371 --> 00:46:47.761
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1072
00:46:47.761 --> 00:46:49.080
<v Speaker 3>So that's something,</v>

1073
00:46:49.081 --> 00:46:49.381
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1074
00:46:49.381 --> 00:46:49.831
<v Speaker 3>I mean you've,</v>

1075
00:46:49.831 --> 00:46:51.620
<v Speaker 3>you've had a dentist drill in your tooth.</v>

1076
00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:52.820
<v Speaker 3>It's like trevaway there,</v>

1077
00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:54.060
<v Speaker 3>but no needles.</v>

1078
00:46:56.850 --> 00:46:59.570
<v Speaker 3>I treated him behaviorally for it's needful.</v>

1079
00:46:59.610 --> 00:46:59.821
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1080
00:46:59.821 --> 00:47:00.960
<v Speaker 3>So what I did was,</v>

1081
00:47:00.961 --> 00:47:01.451
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

1082
00:47:01.451 --> 00:47:04.980
<v Speaker 3>he trusted me and I have rules in my therapy session.</v>

1083
00:47:04.981 --> 00:47:09.740
<v Speaker 3>Like I am not going to do anything that we do not agree on period.</v>

1084
00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:10.703
<v Speaker 3>Ever.</v>

1085
00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:10.981
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

1086
00:47:10.981 --> 00:47:12.180
<v Speaker 3>So that's the crucial issue.</v>

1087
00:47:12.181 --> 00:47:13.320
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to treat help,</v>

1088
00:47:13.321 --> 00:47:14.460
<v Speaker 3>something with the fear.</v>

1089
00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:15.031
<v Speaker 3>So I said,</v>

1090
00:47:15.031 --> 00:47:15.660
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1091
00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:17.250
<v Speaker 3>you probably need to get over this beautiful,</v>

1092
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1093
00:47:17.410 --> 00:47:20.850
<v Speaker 3>because I thought the whole dental surgery keeping it seems a little much,</v>

1094
00:47:21.090 --> 00:47:23.940
<v Speaker 3>and he needed to get blood tests and other things because you need to get a</v>

1095
00:47:23.941 --> 00:47:24.800
<v Speaker 3>needle down with him.</v>

1096
00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:25.501
<v Speaker 3>And so I said,</v>

1097
00:47:25.501 --> 00:47:25.621
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1098
00:47:25.621 --> 00:47:27.660
<v Speaker 3>let's see if we can get rid of this needle phobia.</v>

1099
00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:28.291
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

1100
00:47:28.291 --> 00:47:28.531
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1101
00:47:28.531 --> 00:47:29.140
<v Speaker 3>we'll give it a try.</v>

1102
00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:29.381
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

1103
00:47:29.381 --> 00:47:29.591
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1104
00:47:29.591 --> 00:47:32.560
<v Speaker 3>well the first thing I'm going to do next session is I'm going to bring in a</v>

1105
00:47:32.561 --> 00:47:33.580
<v Speaker 3>hacker here with Neil.</v>

1106
00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:35.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to put it on the shelf.</v>

1107
00:47:35.111 --> 00:47:38.800
<v Speaker 3>And I showed him exactly where on Michelle funds going to put it.</v>

1108
00:47:38.801 --> 00:47:39.031
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1109
00:47:39.031 --> 00:47:41.080
<v Speaker 3>just look at that place in the shelf.</v>

1110
00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:43.440
<v Speaker 3>And I said that because if you're afraid to something,</v>

1111
00:47:43.441 --> 00:47:43.980
<v Speaker 3>you don't like,</v>

1112
00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:44.813
<v Speaker 3>come it.</v>

1113
00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:46.330
<v Speaker 3>So you avoided.</v>

1114
00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:50.960
<v Speaker 3>So one way of not being afraid of something is to not avoid it.</v>

1115
00:47:51.210 --> 00:47:51.480
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1116
00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:51.571
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1117
00:47:51.571 --> 00:47:54.100
<v Speaker 3>just look on the shelf and get to know you with that.</v>

1118
00:47:54.370 --> 00:47:55.181
<v Speaker 3>So he said,</v>

1119
00:47:55.181 --> 00:47:55.540
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1120
00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:55.871
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1121
00:47:55.871 --> 00:47:56.081
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1122
00:47:56.081 --> 00:47:56.740
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1123
00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:57.130
<v Speaker 3>next,</v>

1124
00:47:57.130 --> 00:47:58.240
<v Speaker 3>next time he came in I said,</v>

1125
00:47:58.241 --> 00:47:59.074
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1126
00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:00.520
<v Speaker 3>I have a seat.</v>

1127
00:48:00.550 --> 00:48:01.480
<v Speaker 3>Make yourself comfortable.</v>

1128
00:48:01.481 --> 00:48:03.280
<v Speaker 3>And see that spot.</v>

1129
00:48:03.281 --> 00:48:04.600
<v Speaker 3>I don't know last time if you look there,</v>

1130
00:48:04.601 --> 00:48:06.850
<v Speaker 3>you'll see a needle and Scott Sheath on it.</v>

1131
00:48:06.851 --> 00:48:08.410
<v Speaker 3>It's got a little orange capsule on it.</v>

1132
00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:09.250
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1133
00:48:09.250 --> 00:48:10.083
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1134
00:48:10.210 --> 00:48:11.410
<v Speaker 3>I want you to just look at the needle.</v>

1135
00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:12.450
<v Speaker 3>Just look,</v>

1136
00:48:12.450 --> 00:48:13.283
<v Speaker 3>it said,</v>

1137
00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:13.990
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1138
00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:14.321
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1139
00:48:14.321 --> 00:48:14.680
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1140
00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:15.550
<v Speaker 3>how's that one said?</v>

1141
00:48:15.570 --> 00:48:16.301
<v Speaker 3>I'm kind of nervous.</v>

1142
00:48:16.301 --> 00:48:16.601
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

1143
00:48:16.601 --> 00:48:16.721
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1144
00:48:16.721 --> 00:48:18.220
<v Speaker 3>just look at it til you're bored.</v>

1145
00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:20.590
<v Speaker 3>Boredom is a form of learning.</v>

1146
00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:22.570
<v Speaker 3>If you're afraid of something,</v>

1147
00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:24.460
<v Speaker 3>what you want to do is become bored by it.</v>

1148
00:48:24.790 --> 00:48:25.330
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1149
00:48:25.330 --> 00:48:26.980
<v Speaker 3>and if you look at me long enough,</v>

1150
00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:30.730
<v Speaker 3>you'll get bored by it because it doesn't do anything and just sits there.</v>

1151
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:34.580
<v Speaker 3>And he bought,</v>

1152
00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:34.931
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

1153
00:48:34.931 --> 00:48:35.221
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1154
00:48:35.221 --> 00:48:35.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1155
00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:36.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm hot.</v>

1156
00:48:36.370 --> 00:48:36.641
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1157
00:48:36.641 --> 00:48:36.881
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1158
00:48:36.881 --> 00:48:37.121
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1159
00:48:37.121 --> 00:48:38.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to pick up the needle.</v>

1160
00:48:38.191 --> 00:48:39.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm not gonna bring them towards you.</v>

1161
00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:41.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to pick it up.</v>

1162
00:48:41.170 --> 00:48:44.110
<v Speaker 3>I know it was lifted four inches off of the shelf cause I wanted him to know</v>

1163
00:48:44.111 --> 00:48:45.130
<v Speaker 3>what the hell was going on.</v>

1164
00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:45.550
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

1165
00:48:45.550 --> 00:48:46.200
<v Speaker 3>Left ended up in.</v>

1166
00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:47.870
<v Speaker 3>That made me kind of nervous.</v>

1167
00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:48.281
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1168
00:48:48.281 --> 00:48:48.401
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1169
00:48:48.401 --> 00:48:51.030
<v Speaker 3>I understand all of this new and renewed the same thing.</v>

1170
00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:55.210
<v Speaker 3>We just watch it until you're okay.</v>

1171
00:48:55.930 --> 00:48:56.291
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

1172
00:48:56.291 --> 00:48:56.531
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1173
00:48:56.531 --> 00:48:57.130
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

1174
00:48:57.130 --> 00:48:57.480
<v Speaker 3>lemon.</v>

1175
00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:58.181
<v Speaker 3>We did the next day.</v>

1176
00:48:58.181 --> 00:48:58.421
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1177
00:48:58.421 --> 00:48:58.511
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1178
00:48:58.511 --> 00:48:59.344
<v Speaker 3>I've been a movement.</v>

1179
00:48:59.710 --> 00:49:00.191
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

1180
00:49:00.191 --> 00:49:00.311
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1181
00:49:00.311 --> 00:49:04.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna move it closer to you and you know any increments and you can stop me</v>

1182
00:49:04.631 --> 00:49:05.231
<v Speaker 3>whenever you want,</v>

1183
00:49:05.231 --> 00:49:06.970
<v Speaker 3>but I'll just move it an inch at a time.</v>

1184
00:49:07.390 --> 00:49:08.750
<v Speaker 3>And how will that be?</v>

1185
00:49:08.751 --> 00:49:09.071
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

1186
00:49:09.071 --> 00:49:09.161
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1187
00:49:09.161 --> 00:49:10.670
<v Speaker 3>I think that anyways,</v>

1188
00:49:10.690 --> 00:49:11.620
<v Speaker 3>by the end of the session,</v>

1189
00:49:11.621 --> 00:49:13.600
<v Speaker 3>I'd had the needle with the,</v>

1190
00:49:13.601 --> 00:49:16.630
<v Speaker 3>she's touching his arm and he leave me,</v>

1191
00:49:16.631 --> 00:49:16.901
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1192
00:49:16.901 --> 00:49:19.510
<v Speaker 3>he would have none of the room screaming if that would've happened,</v>

1193
00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:20.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1194
00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:21.120
<v Speaker 3>the session before that,</v>

1195
00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:21.910
<v Speaker 3>and that was enough.</v>

1196
00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:23.080
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to push it too far,</v>

1197
00:49:23.350 --> 00:49:24.910
<v Speaker 3>but here is with nothing.</v>

1198
00:49:25.210 --> 00:49:27.610
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have rocks.</v>

1199
00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:30.970
<v Speaker 3>Now it turned out when the behaviors,</v>

1200
00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:31.990
<v Speaker 3>if your experiments,</v>

1201
00:49:31.991 --> 00:49:35.410
<v Speaker 3>they found out that you definitely have to ask the person to relax in order for</v>

1202
00:49:35.411 --> 00:49:36.580
<v Speaker 3>the balloons to,</v>

1203
00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:40.060
<v Speaker 3>for voluntary exposure to the balloons to have me a sec.</v>

1204
00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:40.781
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1205
00:49:40.781 --> 00:49:44.100
<v Speaker 3>News have been voluntarily expose themselves to what they were afraid.</v>

1206
00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:45.700
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1207
00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:46.630
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1208
00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:49.300
<v Speaker 3>that was a major discovery.</v>

1209
00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:53.890
<v Speaker 3>And if turns out that pretty much every school of clinical psychology has come</v>

1210
00:49:53.891 --> 00:49:54.910
<v Speaker 3>from agree on that.</v>

1211
00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:57.490
<v Speaker 3>How do you help someone with what you're afraid of?</v>

1212
00:49:57.550 --> 00:50:00.070
<v Speaker 3>And this is important because we're afraid of life,</v>

1213
00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:01.750
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1214
00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:04.960
<v Speaker 3>So if you figure out how you help someone over from their fear,</v>

1215
00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:08.440
<v Speaker 3>but that's a big deal because you're afraid of life and you should be because</v>

1216
00:50:08.441 --> 00:50:09.610
<v Speaker 3>life will kill you.</v>

1217
00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:12.580
<v Speaker 3>And so it's no wonder you're afraid of it.</v>

1218
00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:14.470
<v Speaker 3>And so what are you going to do about that?</v>

1219
00:50:14.570 --> 00:50:16.570
<v Speaker 3>It's not like people have phobias and so far,</v>

1220
00:50:16.571 --> 00:50:16.810
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1221
00:50:16.810 --> 00:50:18.680
<v Speaker 3>aren't afraid to face with no harmful.</v>

1222
00:50:18.770 --> 00:50:20.740
<v Speaker 3>They're often afraid of things that are harmful.</v>

1223
00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:24.070
<v Speaker 3>And the mystery is often why other people aren't afraid,</v>

1224
00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:25.540
<v Speaker 3>not why they are.</v>

1225
00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:26.913
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1226
00:50:29.140 --> 00:50:31.820
<v Speaker 3>how do you help someone become less afraid?</v>

1227
00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:33.260
<v Speaker 3>You actually don't.</v>

1228
00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:35.450
<v Speaker 3>You actually help them become more courageous.</v>

1229
00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:39.080
<v Speaker 3>That's cause that's not the same thing.</v>

1230
00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:39.780
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1231
00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:43.880
<v Speaker 3>because like actually is dangerous and if your ability to prevail in life is</v>

1232
00:50:43.881 --> 00:50:45.650
<v Speaker 3>dependent on you not being afraid of life,</v>

1233
00:50:45.651 --> 00:50:49.700
<v Speaker 3>it's like that's kind of a nonstarter because there's lots of things that might</v>

1234
00:50:49.701 --> 00:50:50.750
<v Speaker 3>come to be afraid of.</v>

1235
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:52.990
<v Speaker 3>And so if you to be successful,</v>

1236
00:50:53.010 --> 00:50:54.650
<v Speaker 3>it had to be not afraid of life.</v>

1237
00:50:54.651 --> 00:50:55.100
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1238
00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:55.610
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1239
00:50:55.610 --> 00:50:57.260
<v Speaker 3>forget about that because you know,</v>

1240
00:50:57.261 --> 00:51:01.730
<v Speaker 3>if you're on someone's deathbed and there's going to be some emotion associated</v>

1241
00:51:01.731 --> 00:51:02.061
<v Speaker 3>with that,</v>

1242
00:51:02.061 --> 00:51:04.750
<v Speaker 3>we're actually afraid of cats and we're afraid if it send the need,</v>

1243
00:51:04.751 --> 00:51:06.010
<v Speaker 3>we're afraid of the trailing,</v>

1244
00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:07.520
<v Speaker 3>we're afraid of pain.</v>

1245
00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:08.900
<v Speaker 3>No bloody wonder,</v>

1246
00:51:08.930 --> 00:51:10.400
<v Speaker 3>that's for sure.</v>

1247
00:51:10.550 --> 00:51:13.550
<v Speaker 3>And so it's not being afraid of it's necessary one,</v>

1248
00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:14.301
<v Speaker 3>then we're lost.</v>

1249
00:51:14.301 --> 00:51:16.070
<v Speaker 3>But that isn't what's necessary.</v>

1250
00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:18.290
<v Speaker 3>What's necessary is to be courageous.</v>

1251
00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:20.181
<v Speaker 3>And that's very,</v>

1252
00:51:20.181 --> 00:51:25.181
<v Speaker 3>very cool because it turns out that you could be more courageous than you think.</v>

1253
00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:29.330
<v Speaker 3>And also turns out that if you put yourself in a situation where you face the</v>

1254
00:51:29.331 --> 00:51:30.470
<v Speaker 3>things you're afraid of,</v>

1255
00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:33.590
<v Speaker 3>you find out that there's way more to you than you thought.</v>

1256
00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:36.770
<v Speaker 3>And what's also cool about that is it doesn't seem to be on the upper limit to</v>

1257
00:51:36.771 --> 00:51:38.870
<v Speaker 3>that because it isn't obvious to,</v>

1258
00:51:38.871 --> 00:51:42.560
<v Speaker 3>if there's anything that you can face without learning how to face.</v>

1259
00:51:42.770 --> 00:51:43.850
<v Speaker 3>And I mean anything.</v>

1260
00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:44.691
<v Speaker 3>When do you think about it?</v>

1261
00:51:44.691 --> 00:51:44.931
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1262
00:51:44.931 --> 00:51:46.670
<v Speaker 3>People work in emergency wards,</v>

1263
00:51:47.090 --> 00:51:47.301
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1264
00:51:47.301 --> 00:51:48.100
<v Speaker 3>So think about that.</v>

1265
00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:48.260
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1266
00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:51.710
<v Speaker 3>what they do is have emergencies all the time and you think,</v>

1267
00:51:51.711 --> 00:51:56.030
<v Speaker 3>well the emergency is something you can tolerate almost by definition would be</v>

1268
00:51:56.031 --> 00:51:56.990
<v Speaker 3>an emergency otherwise.</v>

1269
00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:58.850
<v Speaker 3>But people specialize in half.</v>

1270
00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:00.740
<v Speaker 3>So obviously they get used to it.</v>

1271
00:52:00.770 --> 00:52:02.840
<v Speaker 3>People work in Palliative care boards,</v>

1272
00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:03.920
<v Speaker 3>that's rough.</v>

1273
00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:07.850
<v Speaker 3>Everybody there is suffering and it's going to die soon and then they do die.</v>

1274
00:52:07.851 --> 00:52:11.630
<v Speaker 3>So not only are you dealing with that and dealing with loss estimates,</v>

1275
00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:13.730
<v Speaker 3>bossing people work in funeral partners,</v>

1276
00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:15.920
<v Speaker 3>so they're dealing with death all the time.</v>

1277
00:52:15.950 --> 00:52:17.690
<v Speaker 3>It's like people are bloody tough.</v>

1278
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:20.150
<v Speaker 3>So my client,</v>

1279
00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:21.740
<v Speaker 3>he was pretty happy about that.</v>

1280
00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:24.500
<v Speaker 3>And so the next session,</v>

1281
00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:25.603
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1282
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:27.950
<v Speaker 3>I told him I was going to take the sheets off the needle,</v>

1283
00:52:28.140 --> 00:52:28.973
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1284
00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:30.590
<v Speaker 3>he was all right with that.</v>

1285
00:52:30.591 --> 00:52:31.730
<v Speaker 3>And then I waved to the,</v>

1286
00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:33.230
<v Speaker 3>but not do maniacally.</v>

1287
00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:39.350
<v Speaker 3>And then I did the same thing and I drove to the point where I can hold the</v>

1288
00:52:39.350 --> 00:52:43.460
<v Speaker 3>needle half an inch away from his arm without him being with him,</v>

1289
00:52:43.461 --> 00:52:44.000
<v Speaker 3>watching,</v>

1290
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:47.030
<v Speaker 3>don't get flinching without turning away with him watching.</v>

1291
00:52:47.530 --> 00:52:50.810
<v Speaker 3>Cause that's the thing is he actually have to face the thing you're afraid of.</v>

1292
00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:52.440
<v Speaker 3>And so that was no for that session.</v>

1293
00:52:52.470 --> 00:52:53.450
<v Speaker 3>Then the next session,</v>

1294
00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:57.350
<v Speaker 3>part of it was trusting because he'd had a bad experience with dentists when he</v>

1295
00:52:57.351 --> 00:52:58.184
<v Speaker 3>was a kid.</v>

1296
00:52:58.220 --> 00:52:59.920
<v Speaker 3>And that was partly what produced his soybean.</v>

1297
00:52:59.921 --> 00:53:04.100
<v Speaker 3>So he didn't really trust people in authority deeply like a scared animal.</v>

1298
00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:04.911
<v Speaker 3>And that's what he said.</v>

1299
00:53:04.911 --> 00:53:05.481
<v Speaker 3>It felt like,</v>

1300
00:53:05.481 --> 00:53:06.470
<v Speaker 3>what's a scared animal?</v>

1301
00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:07.490
<v Speaker 3>That's the three d book.</v>

1302
00:53:07.491 --> 00:53:08.120
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1303
00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:12.020
<v Speaker 3>And so the other thing I had in practice was telling me to stop and,</v>

1304
00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:12.981
<v Speaker 3>and leaving.</v>

1305
00:53:12.981 --> 00:53:13.281
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1306
00:53:13.281 --> 00:53:13.521
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1307
00:53:13.521 --> 00:53:14.354
<v Speaker 3>we're going to,</v>

1308
00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:19.420
<v Speaker 3>you tell me to stop what I'm doing and then leave and I've won't stopped and</v>

1309
00:53:19.541 --> 00:53:19.671
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>

1310
00:53:19.671 --> 00:53:21.140
<v Speaker 3>I can just tell him that.</v>

1311
00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:22.370
<v Speaker 3>And he would have believed me.</v>

1312
00:53:22.371 --> 00:53:26.050
<v Speaker 3>But that's not the same thing as actually practicing and it happen.</v>

1313
00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:28.460
<v Speaker 3>So He'd say the needle,</v>

1314
00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:28.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1315
00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:29.200
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1316
00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:31.150
<v Speaker 3>and around you can say stop doing that.</v>

1317
00:53:31.170 --> 00:53:31.830
<v Speaker 3>Stop.</v>

1318
00:53:31.830 --> 00:53:32.251
<v Speaker 3>And he'd say,</v>

1319
00:53:32.251 --> 00:53:32.821
<v Speaker 3>I'm leaving.</v>

1320
00:53:32.821 --> 00:53:33.840
<v Speaker 3>And then he'd get up and leave it.</v>

1321
00:53:33.841 --> 00:53:36.480
<v Speaker 3>I just let them leave until we get that five or six times.</v>

1322
00:53:36.481 --> 00:53:39.360
<v Speaker 3>Like he would do a per 10 playing thing with the kid,</v>

1323
00:53:39.570 --> 00:53:40.200
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1324
00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:42.150
<v Speaker 3>And so then that God,</v>

1325
00:53:42.151 --> 00:53:44.850
<v Speaker 3>the idea of deep in him that if he could just get the hell out of here,</v>

1326
00:53:44.851 --> 00:53:45.311
<v Speaker 3>there are no,</v>

1327
00:53:45.311 --> 00:53:47.010
<v Speaker 3>it would bug him if he wanted to.</v>

1328
00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:52.460
<v Speaker 3>Part of increasing the trust that he had with me and so are the end of that</v>

1329
00:53:52.621 --> 00:53:53.454
<v Speaker 3>session,</v>

1330
00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:58.110
<v Speaker 3>I was able to cover the needle with a piece of paper so he couldn't see it and</v>

1331
00:53:58.111 --> 00:54:00.250
<v Speaker 3>touch his skin with a short bed.</v>

1332
00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:04.740
<v Speaker 3>So that was pretty damn good because that was both the needle like a needle.</v>

1333
00:54:04.780 --> 00:54:07.480
<v Speaker 3>Then you can see it as one thing and the naval.</v>

1334
00:54:07.481 --> 00:54:09.240
<v Speaker 3>Then you can see it's held by someone who'd been,</v>

1335
00:54:09.241 --> 00:54:10.470
<v Speaker 3>trust is another thing,</v>

1336
00:54:10.770 --> 00:54:11.460
<v Speaker 3>but a late,</v>

1337
00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:14.790
<v Speaker 3>you can't see that's being moved by someone that you sort of trust.</v>

1338
00:54:14.791 --> 00:54:16.050
<v Speaker 3>That's a whole different thing.</v>

1339
00:54:16.110 --> 00:54:17.340
<v Speaker 3>And he could manage that.</v>

1340
00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:17.760
<v Speaker 3>And anyway,</v>

1341
00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:17.880
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1342
00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:21.300
<v Speaker 3>if you have the doctor and his needles and so arranged for him.</v>

1343
00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:26.360
<v Speaker 3>And the moral of that story is you don't have to relax number features,</v>

1344
00:54:26.470 --> 00:54:27.510
<v Speaker 3>the things that you're afraid of.</v>

1345
00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:28.353
<v Speaker 3>You just have enough money,</v>

1346
00:54:28.370 --> 00:54:29.203
<v Speaker 3>want face.</v>

1347
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:31.460
<v Speaker 3>And that's so cool.</v>

1348
00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:32.061
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1349
00:54:32.061 --> 00:54:33.620
<v Speaker 3>now let me tell you a different story.</v>

1350
00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:35.550
<v Speaker 3>So that's part of group</v>

1351
00:54:35.790 --> 00:54:40.790
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

1352
00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:50.160
<v Speaker 3>One is you know of is set up straight with your shoulders back and people have</v>

1353
00:54:51.991 --> 00:54:56.991
<v Speaker 3>criticized that chapter misread or non branded [inaudible] what I'm talking</v>

1354
00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:00.270
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

1355
00:55:00.270 --> 00:55:02.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about hierarchies is pile,</v>

1356
00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:02.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1357
00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:05.810
<v Speaker 3>then to standing up straight with your shoulders back and to somehow new</v>

1358
00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:07.320
<v Speaker 3>dominant and powerful.</v>

1359
00:55:07.410 --> 00:55:08.610
<v Speaker 3>And that's complete rubbish.</v>

1360
00:55:08.611 --> 00:55:10.710
<v Speaker 3>That isn't what that chapter is about at all.</v>

1361
00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:11.910
<v Speaker 3>It's about something else.</v>

1362
00:55:11.911 --> 00:55:13.560
<v Speaker 3>It's about the idea of it all.</v>

1363
00:55:13.561 --> 00:55:16.010
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to be successful in your hierarchy,</v>

1364
00:55:16.110 --> 00:55:17.910
<v Speaker 3>suppose things from Harvard for free range,</v>

1365
00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:22.300
<v Speaker 3>the best thing that you can be as courageous and because people admire George</v>

1366
00:55:22.380 --> 00:55:25.890
<v Speaker 3>and they promoted the name and the admired by late and they,</v>

1367
00:55:25.940 --> 00:55:26.370
<v Speaker 3>and they,</v>

1368
00:55:26.370 --> 00:55:26.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1369
00:55:26.820 --> 00:55:28.370
<v Speaker 3>they mimicking and,</v>

1370
00:55:28.730 --> 00:55:30.360
<v Speaker 3>and if you're a courageous person,</v>

1371
00:55:30.361 --> 00:55:33.540
<v Speaker 3>then people are happy with you.</v>

1372
00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:37.380
<v Speaker 3>And then you can lead them and so forth.</v>

1373
00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:38.090
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1374
00:55:38.090 --> 00:55:41.910
<v Speaker 3>and to stand up straight with your shoulders back this to maximally expose</v>

1375
00:55:41.911 --> 00:55:44.970
<v Speaker 3>yourself to the world and such an extensive courage.</v>

1376
00:55:45.510 --> 00:55:46.141
<v Speaker 3>And so that's,</v>

1377
00:55:46.141 --> 00:55:46.561
<v Speaker 3>that's why,</v>

1378
00:55:46.561 --> 00:55:47.394
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1379
00:55:47.460 --> 00:55:49.110
<v Speaker 3>that's why that's a useful thing.</v>

1380
00:55:49.630 --> 00:55:54.630
<v Speaker 3>And it turns out that our hierarchies told so much reward power for example,</v>

1381
00:55:55.561 --> 00:55:57.720
<v Speaker 3>as the reward offer id,</v>

1382
00:55:57.721 --> 00:55:58.051
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

1383
00:55:58.051 --> 00:55:59.550
<v Speaker 3>competence and so forth.</v>

1384
00:55:59.551 --> 00:56:02.760
<v Speaker 3>But you develop confidence as the consequences of courage because you</v>

1385
00:56:02.761 --> 00:56:06.570
<v Speaker 3>development prominence by facing things that you don't have it yet mastered.</v>

1386
00:56:06.810 --> 00:56:09.780
<v Speaker 3>Overcoming your fear and learning to master them and then you become competent</v>

1387
00:56:09.781 --> 00:56:10.501
<v Speaker 3>and that moves you up.</v>

1388
00:56:10.501 --> 00:56:14.580
<v Speaker 3>The hierarchy in our functional hierarchies are predicated upon confidence and</v>

1389
00:56:14.581 --> 00:56:17.160
<v Speaker 3>competence is predicated on courage.</v>

1390
00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:22.150
<v Speaker 3>And so we should facilitate good way.</v>

1391
00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:24.330
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty good way of being in the world.</v>

1392
00:56:24.970 --> 00:56:26.980
<v Speaker 3>What does it do for you?</v>

1393
00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:31.090
<v Speaker 3>Why do you think there's no amount of you?</v>

1394
00:56:31.091 --> 00:56:33.400
<v Speaker 3>And there's a lot of the world and the world's a pretty dangerous place.</v>

1395
00:56:33.401 --> 00:56:34.840
<v Speaker 3>And maybe what you should do is go high,</v>

1396
00:56:35.470 --> 00:56:37.390
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't really help to hide,</v>

1397
00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:38.830
<v Speaker 3>which is why it's going to parents.</v>

1398
00:56:38.831 --> 00:56:40.690
<v Speaker 3>And all they do is encourage you to hide.</v>

1399
00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:44.950
<v Speaker 3>Then you have bad parents and they just make you weak and then you're weak and</v>

1400
00:56:44.951 --> 00:56:46.240
<v Speaker 3>maybe you're hiding,</v>

1401
00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:49.300
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't matter because no matter where you hide me,</v>

1402
00:56:49.301 --> 00:56:51.250
<v Speaker 3>you're never going to be able to hide from what you're afraid of.</v>

1403
00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:54.010
<v Speaker 3>Because wherever you are,</v>

1404
00:56:54.100 --> 00:56:56.680
<v Speaker 3>no matter how much do you hide the thing that you're afraid of,</v>

1405
00:56:56.681 --> 00:56:57.530
<v Speaker 3>we'll find you.</v>

1406
00:56:58.710 --> 00:57:01.180
<v Speaker 3>And even if it doesn't sign you in the world and in the near future,</v>

1407
00:57:01.181 --> 00:57:02.590
<v Speaker 3>we'll find you nightmares.</v>

1408
00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:03.521
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter.</v>

1409
00:57:03.521 --> 00:57:06.250
<v Speaker 3>There's no hiding from it at all.</v>

1410
00:57:06.850 --> 00:57:09.970
<v Speaker 3>And so as a parent who don't try to protect your children,</v>

1411
00:57:09.971 --> 00:57:11.440
<v Speaker 3>who tried to get some strong,</v>

1412
00:57:11.530 --> 00:57:13.990
<v Speaker 3>and you do that by exposing them to the world,</v>

1413
00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:16.930
<v Speaker 3>that's why you don't bother Jim Escape one,</v>

1414
00:57:17.030 --> 00:57:19.660
<v Speaker 3>not school rules or Memphis correctly.</v>

1415
00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:20.880
<v Speaker 3>11 this rule,</v>

1416
00:57:20.890 --> 00:57:25.890
<v Speaker 3>11 because skateboarding is dangerous doing it involves mastery and you want to</v>

1417
00:57:26.681 --> 00:57:27.150
<v Speaker 3>do your job,</v>

1418
00:57:27.150 --> 00:57:31.240
<v Speaker 3>the masculine World Cup to be protected from the world because there's no</v>

1419
00:57:31.450 --> 00:57:32.830
<v Speaker 3>protection from the world.</v>

1420
00:57:32.890 --> 00:57:35.950
<v Speaker 3>And if you tried to protect your child from the world,</v>

1421
00:57:36.010 --> 00:57:39.160
<v Speaker 3>then you are the thing they should be protected from.</v>

1422
00:57:39.670 --> 00:57:43.600
<v Speaker 3>So encouragement now,</v>

1423
00:57:43.601 --> 00:57:44.900
<v Speaker 3>watch what happens with you.</v>

1424
00:57:44.950 --> 00:57:47.420
<v Speaker 3>Load test yourself against it.</v>

1425
00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:50.020
<v Speaker 3>Well the first thing is learned something.</v>

1426
00:57:50.690 --> 00:57:54.490
<v Speaker 3>And so the psychologist Pha that I told you about before,</v>

1427
00:57:54.491 --> 00:57:56.230
<v Speaker 3>he watched how children learned that he looked,</v>

1428
00:57:56.290 --> 00:57:56.990
<v Speaker 3>he noticed it,</v>

1429
00:57:56.990 --> 00:57:57.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1430
00:57:57.530 --> 00:58:00.330
<v Speaker 3>shop and try new things and experiment with new things.</v>

1431
00:58:00.331 --> 00:58:01.180
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1432
00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:03.040
<v Speaker 3>when my daughter was young for example,</v>

1433
00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:03.500
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>

1434
00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:05.230
<v Speaker 3>due to things that I felt quite cool,</v>

1435
00:58:05.310 --> 00:58:06.450
<v Speaker 3>she had this little box,</v>

1436
00:58:06.451 --> 00:58:08.830
<v Speaker 3>a cardboard box and was full of books,</v>

1437
00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:09.753
<v Speaker 3>cardboard books.</v>

1438
00:58:09.810 --> 00:58:10.630
<v Speaker 3>It was solid.</v>

1439
00:58:10.630 --> 00:58:14.380
<v Speaker 3>We bought this fake Disney books and about four that would fit into the little</v>

1440
00:58:14.381 --> 00:58:15.040
<v Speaker 3>bump box.</v>

1441
00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:19.420
<v Speaker 3>And they sit very tightly and when she would shake them out to the box and then</v>

1442
00:58:19.421 --> 00:58:20.260
<v Speaker 3>put them in,</v>

1443
00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:23.770
<v Speaker 3>it was hard in what she was doing was learning how to use your hands,</v>

1444
00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:24.970
<v Speaker 3>which is actually quite useful.</v>

1445
00:58:24.971 --> 00:58:27.190
<v Speaker 3>You may notice you use your hands and went to bed.</v>

1446
00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:29.860
<v Speaker 3>And so learning how foods to have is a good thing.</v>

1447
00:58:29.861 --> 00:58:34.000
<v Speaker 3>And so she would sit there and literally for an hour [inaudible] the books and</v>

1448
00:58:34.001 --> 00:58:37.210
<v Speaker 3>then putting them in and she could get it for me out before I had no problem.</v>

1449
00:58:37.211 --> 00:58:37.991
<v Speaker 3>But that fourth one,</v>

1450
00:58:37.991 --> 00:58:38.231
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1451
00:58:38.231 --> 00:58:42.820
<v Speaker 3>that was a pain and she just worry at 40 worried [inaudible] would go in and</v>

1452
00:58:42.821 --> 00:58:45.580
<v Speaker 3>that the first thing she did was shake it out of him achieving really</v>

1453
00:58:45.581 --> 00:58:46.510
<v Speaker 3>concentrating on that.</v>

1454
00:58:46.580 --> 00:58:47.740
<v Speaker 3>So she was,</v>

1455
00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:52.480
<v Speaker 3>she was mastering that technique that was fuck hand eye coordination,</v>

1456
00:58:52.481 --> 00:58:53.620
<v Speaker 3>which is very useful.</v>

1457
00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:53.881
<v Speaker 3>Let's see,</v>

1458
00:58:53.881 --> 00:58:55.690
<v Speaker 3>you want to stumble into things and be awkward.</v>

1459
00:58:55.690 --> 00:58:57.400
<v Speaker 3>So that's what she was tipped trying.</v>

1460
00:58:57.401 --> 00:59:00.520
<v Speaker 3>And then I watched her on the monkey bars in our backyard,</v>

1461
00:59:00.730 --> 00:59:01.640
<v Speaker 3>which she was very little.</v>

1462
00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:04.050
<v Speaker 3>She was only maybe two months old.</v>

1463
00:59:04.180 --> 00:59:06.400
<v Speaker 3>These monkey bars were too high for her and,</v>

1464
00:59:06.401 --> 00:59:09.520
<v Speaker 3>but she wanted to try them anyways and we would watch her with some</v>

1465
00:59:09.521 --> 00:59:10.121
<v Speaker 3>apprehension,</v>

1466
00:59:10.121 --> 00:59:11.120
<v Speaker 3>but we didn't run out.</v>

1467
00:59:11.230 --> 00:59:14.810
<v Speaker 3>Then we had to wait until she was three rounds out up and then and go,</v>

1468
00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:15.760
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

1469
00:59:15.761 --> 00:59:19.210
<v Speaker 3>but your fault so that she would fall and large endeavor to do that again.</v>

1470
00:59:19.410 --> 00:59:21.070
<v Speaker 3>Just what you do is you're a bad parents.</v>

1471
00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:22.983
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1472
00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:23.991
<v Speaker 3>And then they say,</v>

1473
00:59:23.991 --> 00:59:24.291
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>

1474
00:59:24.291 --> 00:59:25.600
<v Speaker 3>I told you right.</v>

1475
00:59:26.060 --> 00:59:26.391
<v Speaker 3>That's fine.</v>

1476
00:59:26.391 --> 00:59:29.930
<v Speaker 3>You can check into those things you think you can do fall.</v>

1477
00:59:29.940 --> 00:59:31.060
<v Speaker 3>Just like I said,</v>

1478
00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:32.270
<v Speaker 3>as she's my scary,</v>

1479
00:59:32.580 --> 00:59:33.413
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

1480
00:59:39.590 --> 00:59:42.320
<v Speaker 3>she'd be on the first wrong and it should do this</v>

1481
00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:46.811
<v Speaker 3>each.</v>

1482
00:59:46.811 --> 00:59:48.340
<v Speaker 3>Each time she left up her foot,</v>

1483
00:59:48.341 --> 00:59:49.690
<v Speaker 3>she left like an inch higher,</v>

1484
00:59:49.691 --> 00:59:49.931
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1485
00:59:49.931 --> 00:59:52.990
<v Speaker 3>She was just right on that edge of disaster,</v>

1486
00:59:53.410 --> 00:59:55.630
<v Speaker 3>which is the best place to play.</v>

1487
00:59:55.840 --> 01:00:00.280
<v Speaker 3>Everyone knows that play on the edge of disaster cause that's where you learn.</v>

1488
01:00:00.310 --> 01:00:01.570
<v Speaker 3>That's where it's exciting.</v>

1489
01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:04.510
<v Speaker 3>And the reason it's exciting is because that's when you're learning and your</v>

1490
01:00:04.511 --> 01:00:07.480
<v Speaker 3>brain is wired to make you excited when you're learning.</v>

1491
01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:12.460
<v Speaker 3>And so she was on the ragged edge being calm about it because she'd get her foot</v>

1492
01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:14.090
<v Speaker 3>up and get to the next rung and then,</v>

1493
01:00:14.670 --> 01:00:16.180
<v Speaker 3>then she did the same thing with the next one.</v>

1494
01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:16.900
<v Speaker 3>There.</v>

1495
01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:18.020
<v Speaker 3>You do it carefully.</v>

1496
01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:21.700
<v Speaker 3>So African American and she managed to go across the top of the monkey bars.</v>

1497
01:00:22.170 --> 01:00:26.170
<v Speaker 3>That was a good paid for her and a good day for us and hopefully that'd paper.</v>

1498
01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:28.290
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1499
01:00:28.290 --> 01:00:30.240
<v Speaker 3>well courageous and more confident that she would be.</v>

1500
01:00:30.241 --> 01:00:32.850
<v Speaker 3>So she learned something from doing that.</v>

1501
01:00:33.150 --> 01:00:33.871
<v Speaker 3>You know when you can say,</v>

1502
01:00:33.871 --> 01:00:33.991
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1503
01:00:33.991 --> 01:00:37.730
<v Speaker 3>she absorbed information from the world and build from cell phone with them that</v>

1504
01:00:37.731 --> 01:00:38.800
<v Speaker 3>that's the way of thinking about it.</v>

1505
01:00:38.801 --> 01:00:39.270
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1506
01:00:39.270 --> 01:00:40.200
<v Speaker 3>the more things you do,</v>

1507
01:00:40.201 --> 01:00:44.100
<v Speaker 3>the more you go around the world and you do things and bang yourself up against</v>

1508
01:00:44.101 --> 01:00:45.560
<v Speaker 3>other people in other situations.</v>

1509
01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:48.230
<v Speaker 3>You learn what you shouldn't do and you learn what you should.</v>

1510
01:00:48.250 --> 01:00:48.421
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1511
01:00:48.421 --> 01:00:53.421
<v Speaker 3>When you make yourself sharper and more in swarm in the formation,</v>

1512
01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:55.730
<v Speaker 3>that's what information means.</v>

1513
01:00:55.731 --> 01:00:59.400
<v Speaker 3>You put yourself in the formation with the world by incorporating the</v>

1514
01:00:59.401 --> 01:01:03.210
<v Speaker 3>information of the world and you do that by exposing yourself to things that you</v>

1515
01:01:03.211 --> 01:01:06.750
<v Speaker 3>haven't yet mastered and you would spend your mastery and that's deeply</v>

1516
01:01:06.751 --> 01:01:07.500
<v Speaker 3>meaningful.</v>

1517
01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:12.110
<v Speaker 3>It's that instinct of meeting is exactly that instinct that tells you when you</v>

1518
01:01:12.111 --> 01:01:14.850
<v Speaker 3>were optimizing the rate at which your competence is developing.</v>

1519
01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:17.580
<v Speaker 3>And that's a really lovely thing to know because you don't,</v>

1520
01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:21.060
<v Speaker 3>you'll find sometimes if you're engaged in what you're doing,</v>

1521
01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:23.500
<v Speaker 3>that's that that's a meaningful thing that you're doing.</v>

1522
01:01:23.501 --> 01:01:24.031
<v Speaker 3>And you mind saying,</v>

1523
01:01:24.031 --> 01:01:25.500
<v Speaker 3>well there isn't any meaning in life.</v>

1524
01:01:25.890 --> 01:01:26.670
<v Speaker 3>Actually the rents,</v>

1525
01:01:26.670 --> 01:01:29.490
<v Speaker 3>you just have to look around and see when it manifests itself.</v>

1526
01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:34.050
<v Speaker 3>And when it manifests itself is when you're expanding that zone of competence</v>

1527
01:01:34.410 --> 01:01:34.561
<v Speaker 3>does,</v>

1528
01:01:34.561 --> 01:01:36.140
<v Speaker 3>that's what meaning is there a signifier?</v>

1529
01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:39.870
<v Speaker 3>And so it's actually very reliable instinct and it's really real.</v>

1530
01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:42.900
<v Speaker 3>It is telling you that you're in the right place at the right time doing the</v>

1531
01:01:42.901 --> 01:01:43.734
<v Speaker 3>right thing.</v>

1532
01:01:44.070 --> 01:01:44.521
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>

1533
01:01:44.521 --> 01:01:45.810
<v Speaker 3>that's a great thing to know.</v>

1534
01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:47.070
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1535
01:01:47.490 --> 01:01:49.140
<v Speaker 3>so you inform yourself.</v>

1536
01:01:49.730 --> 01:01:50.610
<v Speaker 3>And so here's how,</v>

1537
01:01:50.670 --> 01:01:51.780
<v Speaker 3>here's a cool thing.</v>

1538
01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:56.980
<v Speaker 3>So in the shark does Egil Cathedral is a cross and a cross is a symbol,</v>

1539
01:01:58.980 --> 01:01:59.581
<v Speaker 3>a symbol,</v>

1540
01:01:59.581 --> 01:02:00.151
<v Speaker 3>an x,</v>

1541
01:02:00.151 --> 01:02:03.880
<v Speaker 3>and you're at the point of the episode that's the x marks the spot and the</v>

1542
01:02:03.881 --> 01:02:04.920
<v Speaker 3>support is you.</v>

1543
01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:06.330
<v Speaker 3>And if it's a cross,</v>

1544
01:02:06.331 --> 01:02:08.040
<v Speaker 3>at least the Christian world,</v>

1545
01:02:08.130 --> 01:02:09.930
<v Speaker 3>it's also a place of suffering.</v>

1546
01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:13.140
<v Speaker 3>And that makes sense because the x marks the spot.</v>

1547
01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:13.561
<v Speaker 3>It's you.</v>

1548
01:02:13.561 --> 01:02:15.000
<v Speaker 3>It's characterized by suffering.</v>

1549
01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:16.810
<v Speaker 3>So that's idea there.</v>

1550
01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:18.000
<v Speaker 3>And then the question is,</v>

1551
01:02:18.001 --> 01:02:18.121
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1552
01:02:18.121 --> 01:02:19.600
<v Speaker 3>what should you do about that suffering?</v>

1553
01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:20.453
<v Speaker 3>Because</v>

1554
01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:21.000
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1555
01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:21.940
<v Speaker 1>it started with that.</v>

1556
01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:23.220
<v Speaker 1>There's no avoiding it.</v>

1557
01:02:23.850 --> 01:02:24.900
<v Speaker 1>It's worse than that.</v>

1558
01:02:24.930 --> 01:02:27.840
<v Speaker 1>It's normally that there's no avoiding it and then it exists.</v>

1559
01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:30.660
<v Speaker 1>It's then a few don't know how to deal with it.</v>

1560
01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:32.430
<v Speaker 1>And it just grinds you up,</v>

1561
01:02:32.431 --> 01:02:34.890
<v Speaker 1>which it certainly will if you know how to deal with it,</v>

1562
01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:39.090
<v Speaker 1>then that would make you bitter and resentful and that will make you cruel.</v>

1563
01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:42.420
<v Speaker 1>And once your banner and resentful and cruel or they will start to become</v>

1564
01:02:42.421 --> 01:02:44.890
<v Speaker 1>destructive and then you'll suffer even more and know,</v>

1565
01:02:44.891 --> 01:02:46.020
<v Speaker 1>spread that everywhere.</v>

1566
01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:48.580
<v Speaker 1>So you actually need to know how to deal with fits.</v>

1567
01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:50.840
<v Speaker 1>And so in the sharp cathedral,</v>

1568
01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:51.990
<v Speaker 1>there's this very cool thing,</v>

1569
01:02:52.050 --> 01:02:53.290
<v Speaker 1>which is a big of room.</v>

1570
01:02:53.291 --> 01:02:53.971
<v Speaker 1>If it's a base,</v>

1571
01:02:53.971 --> 01:02:54.840
<v Speaker 1>it's a circle.</v>

1572
01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:59.490
<v Speaker 1>It's divided into four parts and it's a simple pilgrimage.</v>

1573
01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:00.151
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1574
01:03:00.151 --> 01:03:02.310
<v Speaker 1>so what happens if you're a medieval type?</v>

1575
01:03:02.311 --> 01:03:03.330
<v Speaker 1>When we go on a pilgrimage,</v>

1576
01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:05.340
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of what you do when you go to Europe,</v>

1577
01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:05.971
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1578
01:03:05.971 --> 01:03:06.790
<v Speaker 1>or whatever.</v>

1579
01:03:06.790 --> 01:03:09.420
<v Speaker 1>Southeast Asia is real common for kids to go to now to,</v>

1580
01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:10.051
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of,</v>

1581
01:03:10.051 --> 01:03:14.160
<v Speaker 1>they grow up and they leave their parents and they go out on this pilgrimage and</v>

1582
01:03:14.161 --> 01:03:18.390
<v Speaker 1>they go where they haven't been and what happens when they go where they haven't</v>

1583
01:03:18.391 --> 01:03:19.590
<v Speaker 1>been as hypothetically,</v>

1584
01:03:19.591 --> 01:03:20.251
<v Speaker 1>they grow up,</v>

1585
01:03:20.251 --> 01:03:21.490
<v Speaker 1>they have some adventures that you,</v>

1586
01:03:21.491 --> 01:03:22.410
<v Speaker 1>some stupid things,</v>

1587
01:03:22.610 --> 01:03:23.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1588
01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:27.120
<v Speaker 1>but they have some adventures and they take care of themselves and so when they</v>

1589
01:03:27.121 --> 01:03:30.420
<v Speaker 1>come back they're there more than they are because they went somewhere and they</v>

1590
01:03:30.421 --> 01:03:31.680
<v Speaker 1>have to be.</v>

1591
01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:34.380
<v Speaker 1>So there is a thing you want to be more than you are,</v>

1592
01:03:34.381 --> 01:03:36.570
<v Speaker 1>then you should go somewhere you haven't been.</v>

1593
01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:39.870
<v Speaker 1>And that's the idea of going on a pilgrimage to go to the center of the world.</v>

1594
01:03:39.930 --> 01:03:43.650
<v Speaker 1>You have a big adventure on the way there and then all the way back and then</v>

1595
01:03:43.651 --> 01:03:45.960
<v Speaker 1>you're not the same when you come back here more than you were.</v>

1596
01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:48.870
<v Speaker 1>Everyone should go on a pilgrimage once in your life.</v>

1597
01:03:49.390 --> 01:03:50.140
<v Speaker 1>Always had dealt with it,</v>

1598
01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:51.150
<v Speaker 1>just structured properly.</v>

1599
01:03:51.151 --> 01:03:55.320
<v Speaker 1>Then you go to the center of things and that's the idea of a holy pilgrimage.</v>

1600
01:03:55.380 --> 01:03:57.720
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that's something that people would have felt,</v>

1601
01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:00.250
<v Speaker 1>but not everybody can afford to go on a pilgrimage.</v>

1602
01:04:00.251 --> 01:04:01.420
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you can do it small.</v>

1603
01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:03.150
<v Speaker 1>We said that the sharp cathedral,</v>

1604
01:04:03.810 --> 01:04:04.860
<v Speaker 1>which is a cross,</v>

1605
01:04:05.130 --> 01:04:05.963
<v Speaker 1>there's a base,</v>

1606
01:04:05.970 --> 01:04:10.970
<v Speaker 1>it's a big piece of 40 feet across and it's a circle divided into four parts.</v>

1607
01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:12.480
<v Speaker 1>So it's the world north,</v>

1608
01:04:12.481 --> 01:04:12.930
<v Speaker 1>west,</v>

1609
01:04:12.930 --> 01:04:13.970
<v Speaker 1>east and sell.</v>

1610
01:04:14.070 --> 01:04:18.390
<v Speaker 1>And you can get to the center of the labyrinth,</v>

1611
01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:21.600
<v Speaker 1>but the way into the center as you entered the labyrinth,</v>

1612
01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:27.260
<v Speaker 1>and then you have to walk in these pathways that demarcate all of the quadrants.</v>

1613
01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:29.550
<v Speaker 1>And to get to the symphony,</v>

1614
01:04:29.551 --> 01:04:30.630
<v Speaker 1>you have to go everywhere.</v>

1615
01:04:32.190 --> 01:04:33.390
<v Speaker 1>That's an idea.</v>

1616
01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:34.920
<v Speaker 1>To get to the center,</v>

1617
01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:37.110
<v Speaker 1>you have to go everywhere.</v>

1618
01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:39.540
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly right.</v>

1619
01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:40.710
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1620
01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:41.610
<v Speaker 1>and why?</v>

1621
01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:41.851
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1622
01:04:41.851 --> 01:04:43.140
<v Speaker 1>if you go everywhere,</v>

1623
01:04:43.170 --> 01:04:44.190
<v Speaker 1>and that takes courage,</v>

1624
01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:46.650
<v Speaker 1>obviously to go everywhere because you'd have to get in front of what you were</v>

1625
01:04:46.651 --> 01:04:48.270
<v Speaker 1>afraid to go everywhere.</v>

1626
01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:51.160
<v Speaker 1>Then you get to the centuries things.</v>

1627
01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:53.680
<v Speaker 1>But why?</v>

1628
01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:54.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1629
01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:57.510
<v Speaker 1>here's one reason you,</v>

1630
01:04:58.040 --> 01:04:59.430
<v Speaker 1>you got a lot of information.</v>

1631
01:04:59.431 --> 01:05:01.980
<v Speaker 1>When you go places that's pretty straight forward.</v>

1632
01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:02.391
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1633
01:05:02.391 --> 01:05:04.590
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sure if you think about it,</v>

1634
01:05:04.591 --> 01:05:05.520
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm wrong about this,</v>

1635
01:05:05.521 --> 01:05:06.360
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think so.</v>

1636
01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:12.140
<v Speaker 1>What I've noticed in my life is that every time I tried to do something that I</v>

1637
01:05:12.211 --> 01:05:15.330
<v Speaker 1>actually tried to do that works,</v>

1638
01:05:15.630 --> 01:05:18.320
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't necessarily get me where was planning to go</v>

1639
01:05:18.670 --> 01:05:19.640
<v Speaker 3>with that plan.</v>

1640
01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:22.060
<v Speaker 3>I've never read and picking up a skill,</v>

1641
01:05:22.090 --> 01:05:22.361
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1642
01:05:22.361 --> 01:05:25.060
<v Speaker 3>I pick up a stihl for a reason and that means it doesn't work out.</v>

1643
01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:29.110
<v Speaker 3>Then I've got the skill and then inevitably that skill comes in useful for</v>

1644
01:05:29.111 --> 01:05:30.340
<v Speaker 3>something along the way.</v>

1645
01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:32.360
<v Speaker 3>And so my sense is</v>

1646
01:05:34.210 --> 01:05:37.060
<v Speaker 3>the things that I've actually attempted to do,</v>

1647
01:05:37.090 --> 01:05:37.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1648
01:05:37.390 --> 01:05:38.260
<v Speaker 3>put some spirited,</v>

1649
01:05:38.810 --> 01:05:42.610
<v Speaker 3>have paid off even though they didn't necessarily pay off the way that I</v>

1650
01:05:42.611 --> 01:05:43.460
<v Speaker 3>expected anyway.</v>

1651
01:05:44.430 --> 01:05:45.263
<v Speaker 3>That's okay.</v>

1652
01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:49.120
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't matter so much whether or not they paid off that matters.</v>

1653
01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:54.420
<v Speaker 3>So the more things you bang yourself up against voluntarily,</v>

1654
01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:57.250
<v Speaker 3>the more courageous you become,</v>

1655
01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:58.870
<v Speaker 3>the more skilled you become,</v>

1656
01:05:59.410 --> 01:06:02.120
<v Speaker 3>the more you're able to deal with your own suffering.</v>

1657
01:06:02.121 --> 01:06:05.860
<v Speaker 3>And that means the less drug you're going to be because suffering than you can't</v>

1658
01:06:05.861 --> 01:06:10.861
<v Speaker 3>manage mixing her up and suffering that you can bear and even bear notably in</v>

1659
01:06:11.171 --> 01:06:12.220
<v Speaker 3>honor of leading well,</v>

1660
01:06:12.221 --> 01:06:13.180
<v Speaker 3>then well,</v>

1661
01:06:13.181 --> 01:06:15.620
<v Speaker 3>that's the definition of a well lived life.</v>

1662
01:06:15.910 --> 01:06:17.590
<v Speaker 3>Here's something else that's cool.</v>

1663
01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:22.780
<v Speaker 3>So there's this idea that if you,</v>

1664
01:06:23.310 --> 01:06:28.000
<v Speaker 3>if you can confront the abyss and then in the abyss there's a monster in the</v>

1665
01:06:28.001 --> 01:06:32.020
<v Speaker 3>belly of the monster is your father and your father was laying there asleep or</v>

1666
01:06:32.021 --> 01:06:32.854
<v Speaker 3>dead.</v>

1667
01:06:32.890 --> 01:06:33.880
<v Speaker 3>You see that in the story,</v>

1668
01:06:33.881 --> 01:06:34.714
<v Speaker 3>but they'll queue.</v>

1669
01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:36.311
<v Speaker 3>It's a very,</v>

1670
01:06:36.311 --> 01:06:37.540
<v Speaker 3>very old idea.</v>

1671
01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:38.291
<v Speaker 3>It's a very,</v>

1672
01:06:38.291 --> 01:06:38.651
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

1673
01:06:38.651 --> 01:06:39.270
<v Speaker 3>very old idea.</v>

1674
01:06:39.270 --> 01:06:42.080
<v Speaker 3>It's Elise 5,000 years old in,</v>

1675
01:06:42.081 --> 01:06:43.390
<v Speaker 3>in recorded form,</v>

1676
01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:45.340
<v Speaker 3>which means it's way older than that,</v>

1677
01:06:45.610 --> 01:06:47.020
<v Speaker 3>but it's really old idea.</v>

1678
01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:48.370
<v Speaker 3>You look at a few,</v>

1679
01:06:48.370 --> 01:06:48.691
<v Speaker 3>we should be.</v>

1680
01:06:48.691 --> 01:06:50.380
<v Speaker 3>So that's what terrifies you in the abyss.</v>

1681
01:06:50.381 --> 01:06:54.370
<v Speaker 3>There's a terrible monster than the most advanced of your father that he's half</v>

1682
01:06:54.371 --> 01:06:56.740
<v Speaker 3>again or to sleep and you see that.</v>

1683
01:06:56.780 --> 01:06:56.960
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1684
01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:57.240
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1685
01:06:57.240 --> 01:06:58.860
<v Speaker 3>you don't use a puppet marionette,</v>

1686
01:06:58.900 --> 01:07:00.820
<v Speaker 3>someone else's pulling his strings.</v>

1687
01:07:00.830 --> 01:07:02.330
<v Speaker 3>If you remember in the parochial movie,</v>

1688
01:07:02.331 --> 01:07:05.620
<v Speaker 3>you may remember this with Velcro goes to the rest of it is farther from the</v>

1689
01:07:05.621 --> 01:07:06.250
<v Speaker 3>depths.</v>

1690
01:07:06.250 --> 01:07:07.630
<v Speaker 3>Not only is he a marionette puppet,</v>

1691
01:07:07.631 --> 01:07:08.980
<v Speaker 3>he's also a jackass.</v>

1692
01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:11.100
<v Speaker 3>That's a bad combination.</v>

1693
01:07:11.101 --> 01:07:13.450
<v Speaker 3>And so not only as something else pulling his strengths,</v>

1694
01:07:13.451 --> 01:07:14.830
<v Speaker 3>he still wouldn't headed puppet,</v>

1695
01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:17.620
<v Speaker 3>but you braise nonsense because he's,</v>

1696
01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:18.400
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

1697
01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:21.160
<v Speaker 3>he's pathologized his capacity for,</v>

1698
01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:22.580
<v Speaker 3>for for truthful speech.</v>

1699
01:07:22.581 --> 01:07:23.710
<v Speaker 3>So he's really in rough shape,</v>

1700
01:07:23.711 --> 01:07:27.880
<v Speaker 3>but he goes down to the depths right to the bottom to see if the thing that</v>

1701
01:07:27.881 --> 01:07:29.470
<v Speaker 3>everything is most afraid of,</v>

1702
01:07:29.650 --> 01:07:30.970
<v Speaker 3>that's the whale on sterling.</v>

1703
01:07:31.110 --> 01:07:31.950
<v Speaker 3>We're may not foot.</v>

1704
01:07:31.970 --> 01:07:33.410
<v Speaker 3>He finds inside the way.</v>

1705
01:07:33.411 --> 01:07:33.880
<v Speaker 3>I won't even know.</v>

1706
01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:38.080
<v Speaker 3>There's no explanation in this story at all about how Japan got there is his</v>

1707
01:07:38.081 --> 01:07:41.950
<v Speaker 3>father and then he rescues his father from the belly of the whale and they go</v>

1708
01:07:41.951 --> 01:07:42.970
<v Speaker 3>back up to the surface.</v>

1709
01:07:43.290 --> 01:07:44.740
<v Speaker 3>Pinocchio becomes a real boy.</v>

1710
01:07:45.550 --> 01:07:49.060
<v Speaker 3>So that's very interesting and it's really interesting cause you go see that</v>

1711
01:07:49.061 --> 01:07:49.361
<v Speaker 3>movie,</v>

1712
01:07:49.361 --> 01:07:50.170
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1713
01:07:50.170 --> 01:07:51.970
<v Speaker 3>All of you pretty much have seen that movie.</v>

1714
01:07:51.971 --> 01:07:53.590
<v Speaker 3>It's like what the hell are you doing?</v>

1715
01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:54.820
<v Speaker 3>Going to see that moving.</v>

1716
01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:58.670
<v Speaker 3>You're watching drawings of a puppet led by a cricket,</v>

1717
01:07:59.050 --> 01:08:00.490
<v Speaker 3>go to the ocean,</v>

1718
01:08:00.610 --> 01:08:02.860
<v Speaker 3>find a whale to rescue his father,</v>

1719
01:08:02.890 --> 01:08:05.400
<v Speaker 3>and somehow that makes it real and you're all capable.</v>

1720
01:08:07.510 --> 01:08:08.560
<v Speaker 3>Makes perfect sense.</v>

1721
01:08:08.561 --> 01:08:10.530
<v Speaker 3>It's like we're making any sense at all</v>

1722
01:08:12.050 --> 01:08:14.490
<v Speaker 3>unless you're were engaged by,</v>

1723
01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:15.980
<v Speaker 3>is it because it's actually</v>

1724
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:16.813
<v Speaker 1>true?</v>

1725
01:08:17.830 --> 01:08:19.010
<v Speaker 1>Here's how it's true.</v>

1726
01:08:19.790 --> 01:08:22.250
<v Speaker 1>This is something geneticists have discovered recently.</v>

1727
01:08:22.970 --> 01:08:23.721
<v Speaker 1>So first of all,</v>

1728
01:08:23.721 --> 01:08:26.690
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing is that if you face what you're afraid of your pants,</v>

1729
01:08:27.170 --> 01:08:29.060
<v Speaker 1>you're going to find all sorts of information,</v>

1730
01:08:29.270 --> 01:08:29.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1731
01:08:29.740 --> 01:08:31.140
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get it all sorts of information.</v>

1732
01:08:31.141 --> 01:08:35.010
<v Speaker 1>You get back that information in Gq and that's going to make you informed.</v>

1733
01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:36.760
<v Speaker 1>So that's part of,</v>

1734
01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:39.350
<v Speaker 1>as part of becoming you are</v>

1735
01:08:42.490 --> 01:08:43.640
<v Speaker 1>now some of that information.</v>

1736
01:08:43.641 --> 01:08:46.450
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get it from other people and those people cause you were</v>

1737
01:08:46.451 --> 01:08:47.420
<v Speaker 1>interacting with all of the time.</v>

1738
01:08:47.421 --> 01:08:50.120
<v Speaker 1>They're telling you all the time about how to behave and how not to behave,</v>

1739
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:53.180
<v Speaker 1>how to be an honorable person and how not to be an awful person in.</v>

1740
01:08:53.181 --> 01:08:54.440
<v Speaker 1>The more you reflect that,</v>

1741
01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:58.610
<v Speaker 1>the more you take on the characteristics that are demanded of youth in some</v>

1742
01:08:58.611 --> 01:08:59.444
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>

1743
01:09:00.410 --> 01:09:03.030
<v Speaker 1>in the way that an ideal is demanded itself.</v>

1744
01:09:03.450 --> 01:09:05.420
<v Speaker 1>If you think about that as a journal ideal,</v>

1745
01:09:05.421 --> 01:09:06.380
<v Speaker 1>at least in part,</v>

1746
01:09:06.650 --> 01:09:08.030
<v Speaker 1>you should be the great father.</v>

1747
01:09:08.270 --> 01:09:09.310
<v Speaker 1>That's who you should be.</v>

1748
01:09:09.311 --> 01:09:10.144
<v Speaker 1>You should grow up.</v>

1749
01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:13.610
<v Speaker 1>That's what you should get when everyone's telling you that at the top,</v>

1750
01:09:13.850 --> 01:09:14.683
<v Speaker 1>including you.</v>

1751
01:09:14.990 --> 01:09:16.940
<v Speaker 1>And so the more you hit yourself against the world,</v>

1752
01:09:16.941 --> 01:09:19.340
<v Speaker 1>the more of that information you're going to incorporate it into more of that</v>

1753
01:09:19.350 --> 01:09:20.240
<v Speaker 1>and you want to do come.</v>

1754
01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:23.510
<v Speaker 1>And that's something like rescue your father from the abyss.</v>

1755
01:09:23.570 --> 01:09:25.370
<v Speaker 1>But here's this thing that's even cooler,</v>

1756
01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:28.310
<v Speaker 1>and it's associated with this idea of the labyrinth as well.</v>

1757
01:09:28.311 --> 01:09:29.450
<v Speaker 1>So the labyrinth,</v>

1758
01:09:29.451 --> 01:09:30.620
<v Speaker 1>which is the pilgrimage,</v>

1759
01:09:30.860 --> 01:09:33.000
<v Speaker 1>you have to go everywhere to get to the middle.</v>

1760
01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:34.760
<v Speaker 1>So here's what happens.</v>

1761
01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:37.940
<v Speaker 1>If I take you out of your comfortable environment,</v>

1762
01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:38.961
<v Speaker 1>when to put new,</v>

1763
01:09:38.961 --> 01:09:39.860
<v Speaker 1>something new,</v>

1764
01:09:39.890 --> 01:09:41.650
<v Speaker 1>put you somewhere new or even better,</v>

1765
01:09:41.690 --> 01:09:43.430
<v Speaker 1>you put yourself somewhere new.</v>

1766
01:09:43.970 --> 01:09:46.100
<v Speaker 1>And that's the only thing that really works by the way.</v>

1767
01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:50.330
<v Speaker 1>So if I present you with a challenge and it's involuntary,</v>

1768
01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:53.210
<v Speaker 1>you'll produce a load of stress hormones and it'll paralyze him.</v>

1769
01:09:53.211 --> 01:09:55.370
<v Speaker 1>But if you take on the same challenge voluntarily,</v>

1770
01:09:55.550 --> 01:09:58.390
<v Speaker 1>you have an entirely different psychophysiological response to.</v>

1771
01:09:59.210 --> 01:10:00.590
<v Speaker 1>It's a completely different things.</v>

1772
01:10:00.591 --> 01:10:02.390
<v Speaker 1>You do it voluntary.</v>

1773
01:10:02.890 --> 01:10:05.130
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to confront the abyssal derelict.</v>

1774
01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:06.733
<v Speaker 1>What happens?</v>

1775
01:10:07.490 --> 01:10:09.890
<v Speaker 1>You put yourself in a radically new situation,</v>

1776
01:10:13.270 --> 01:10:16.460
<v Speaker 1>your genes turn oh new proteins and manufactured different structures in your</v>

1777
01:10:16.461 --> 01:10:17.294
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

1778
01:10:18.290 --> 01:10:19.340
<v Speaker 1>You turned your cell phone.</v>

1779
01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:21.740
<v Speaker 1>But we don't know the limit to that.</v>

1780
01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:25.210
<v Speaker 1>And so you haven't paid attention.</v>

1781
01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:25.690
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1782
01:10:25.690 --> 01:10:28.700
<v Speaker 1>we're going to potentially as part what you could learn as a consequence of</v>

1783
01:10:28.701 --> 01:10:29.690
<v Speaker 1>being informed.</v>

1784
01:10:29.870 --> 01:10:34.700
<v Speaker 1>But there's also a potential genuinely there's a potential inside of you at the</v>

1785
01:10:34.701 --> 01:10:38.840
<v Speaker 1>molecular level and the way you turn that potential audience by struck,</v>

1786
01:10:38.841 --> 01:10:39.830
<v Speaker 1>by stressing yourself,</v>

1787
01:10:40.140 --> 01:10:41.450
<v Speaker 1>by challenging yourself,</v>

1788
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1789
01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:46.610
<v Speaker 1>By adopting a sense of courage in the world and by pushing yourself beyond where</v>

1790
01:10:46.611 --> 01:10:48.440
<v Speaker 1>you are into new domains.</v>

1791
01:10:48.530 --> 01:10:50.270
<v Speaker 1>And the consequence of the VAT is,</v>

1792
01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:55.360
<v Speaker 1>is that the genes in your neural structures cold for Neupro proteins and they</v>

1793
01:10:55.581 --> 01:10:57.820
<v Speaker 1>may do a new thing out with you.</v>

1794
01:10:59.060 --> 01:11:01.220
<v Speaker 1>And we have no idea what the limit of that is.</v>

1795
01:11:01.221 --> 01:11:01.821
<v Speaker 1>It's so you think,</v>

1796
01:11:01.821 --> 01:11:02.240
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1797
01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:05.180
<v Speaker 1>what's that new thing that's being turned on?</v>

1798
01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:05.871
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1799
01:11:05.871 --> 01:11:09.760
<v Speaker 1>obviously you know it'd be around for three and a half billion years.</v>

1800
01:11:09.770 --> 01:11:10.670
<v Speaker 1>You're not stupid.</v>

1801
01:11:10.730 --> 01:11:12.830
<v Speaker 1>Even though they asked student from time to time,</v>

1802
01:11:14.210 --> 01:11:16.350
<v Speaker 1>you have this limitless biological,</v>

1803
01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:19.320
<v Speaker 1>in some sense it's ready to manifest itself,</v>

1804
01:11:19.321 --> 01:11:20.730
<v Speaker 1>but it's not going to manifest itself.</v>

1805
01:11:20.731 --> 01:11:21.564
<v Speaker 1>That will key in.</v>

1806
01:11:22.050 --> 01:11:26.560
<v Speaker 1>It needs a reason to turn it on and so you go somewhere new voluntarily and</v>

1807
01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:29.940
<v Speaker 1>things that would help you cope with that new thing.</v>

1808
01:11:29.970 --> 01:11:31.800
<v Speaker 1>Turn on and then you might think,</v>

1809
01:11:31.801 --> 01:11:31.951
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1810
01:11:31.951 --> 01:11:32.400
<v Speaker 1>what would happen?</v>

1811
01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:35.760
<v Speaker 1>You can just go to the old it on and that's who that might be.</v>

1812
01:11:35.761 --> 01:11:36.561
<v Speaker 1>Well then you would need to be,</v>

1813
01:11:36.561 --> 01:11:41.280
<v Speaker 1>you should be and that would be equivalent to rescue your father from the belly,</v>

1814
01:11:41.281 --> 01:11:42.114
<v Speaker 1>from the base thing.</v>

1815
01:11:42.270 --> 01:11:42.751
<v Speaker 1>That would be that.</v>

1816
01:11:42.751 --> 01:11:44.940
<v Speaker 1>The same thing is take you on habit,</v>

1817
01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:46.310
<v Speaker 1>that architectural,</v>

1818
01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:47.533
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>

1819
01:11:47.550 --> 01:11:51.690
<v Speaker 1>That architecture than desirable structure of authority and incorporating that</v>

1820
01:11:51.691 --> 01:11:53.070
<v Speaker 1>in something like that.</v>

1821
01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:54.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1822
01:11:54.940 --> 01:11:59.940
<v Speaker 1>what you need in order to do that is courage and faith to faith fit.</v>

1823
01:12:00.870 --> 01:12:01.950
<v Speaker 1>If you manifest courage,</v>

1824
01:12:01.951 --> 01:12:04.770
<v Speaker 1>that the consequences of that will be positive.</v>

1825
01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:08.830
<v Speaker 1>And the only way you look for find out is if you try it.</v>

1826
01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:10.260
<v Speaker 1>And if no one else can tell you,</v>

1827
01:12:10.290 --> 01:12:11.130
<v Speaker 1>pick an hint at it,</v>

1828
01:12:11.131 --> 01:12:12.030
<v Speaker 1>but you can't do,</v>

1829
01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:13.780
<v Speaker 1>this is something they can essentially.</v>

1830
01:12:13.781 --> 01:12:15.400
<v Speaker 1>So the 1953 is,</v>

1831
01:12:15.410 --> 01:12:16.350
<v Speaker 1>it's on you.</v>

1832
01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:19.230
<v Speaker 1>The only person that can find out if this is actually true,</v>

1833
01:12:19.231 --> 01:12:20.064
<v Speaker 1>it's you.</v>

1834
01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:23.560
<v Speaker 1>It's your the what she has to face the things that you're particularly afraid of</v>

1835
01:12:24.150 --> 01:12:24.960
<v Speaker 1>and you're the one,</v>

1836
01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:26.110
<v Speaker 1>there's an old story,</v>

1837
01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:28.290
<v Speaker 1>King Arthur and the knights of the round table,</v>

1838
01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:30.750
<v Speaker 1>they're often look for the holy grail,</v>

1839
01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:33.060
<v Speaker 1>which is the container of what everyone needs,</v>

1840
01:12:33.090 --> 01:12:34.440
<v Speaker 1>whatever that is.</v>

1841
01:12:34.530 --> 01:12:36.810
<v Speaker 1>And of course they don't know where an intelligible though for the holy grail,</v>

1842
01:12:36.860 --> 01:12:37.411
<v Speaker 1>who knows,</v>

1843
01:12:37.411 --> 01:12:38.850
<v Speaker 1>where do you go look for the holy grail?</v>

1844
01:12:39.150 --> 01:12:43.380
<v Speaker 1>And so they move away from the round table and they all enter the forest and</v>

1845
01:12:43.381 --> 01:12:46.770
<v Speaker 1>each of the master's before I step a place that looks darkness to him.</v>

1846
01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:50.010
<v Speaker 1>And that's when you started the search for the holy grail.</v>

1847
01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:53.280
<v Speaker 1>So that's very much worth knowing as well.</v>

1848
01:12:54.210 --> 01:12:58.710
<v Speaker 1>So courage for why do you need courage?</v>

1849
01:12:59.370 --> 01:13:04.370
<v Speaker 1>Because like this terrible suffering and it's malevolence and so you have every</v>

1850
01:13:06.011 --> 01:13:07.190
<v Speaker 1>reason to be terrified.</v>

1851
01:13:07.820 --> 01:13:11.970
<v Speaker 1>There was no real way out for them because that's the ground of existence,</v>

1852
01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:13.051
<v Speaker 1>but it turns out,</v>

1853
01:13:13.051 --> 01:13:17.520
<v Speaker 1>but that's okay because there's more genes than we think and the way you find</v>

1854
01:13:17.521 --> 01:13:21.990
<v Speaker 1>out if it's more and what that more is is by facing a thing that's terrifying</v>

1855
01:13:22.050 --> 01:13:23.160
<v Speaker 1>and maybe facing up thing.</v>

1856
01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:28.160
<v Speaker 1>That's my level and as well because that could be obligation to face the</v>

1857
01:13:29.401 --> 01:13:33.480
<v Speaker 1>suffering of the world and strengthened malevolence within it and it turns out</v>

1858
01:13:33.481 --> 01:13:38.481
<v Speaker 1>that even though that's an overwhelming task by definition that you're probably</v>

1859
01:13:38.521 --> 01:13:42.710
<v Speaker 1>up to it and if you took on the responsibility of doing that,</v>

1860
01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:43.553
<v Speaker 1>pulling terribly,</v>

1861
01:13:43.770 --> 01:13:47.820
<v Speaker 1>then what would happen is that you would discover that you were up to and what</v>

1862
01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:49.230
<v Speaker 1>the consequences of that would be,</v>

1863
01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:53.980
<v Speaker 1>at least in part is not so much that the suffering in life would disappear or</v>

1864
01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.220
<v Speaker 1>God only knows how much we can constrain it.</v>

1865
01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:58.350
<v Speaker 1>If we all seriously tried,</v>

1866
01:13:58.380 --> 01:14:01.320
<v Speaker 1>but then in the attempt to thinks any extreme,</v>

1867
01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:02.610
<v Speaker 1>you'll find a meeting.</v>

1868
01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:06.510
<v Speaker 1>It's so engaging and so overwhelming that that in itself will serve as a</v>

1869
01:14:06.511 --> 01:14:10.920
<v Speaker 1>medication against the suffering of him and malevolence that exists.</v>

1870
01:14:11.190 --> 01:14:12.340
<v Speaker 1>And all of that</v>

1871
01:14:12.430 --> 01:14:16.150
<v Speaker 2>appears to be just simply true.</v>

1872
01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:19.750
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

1873
01:14:19.750 --> 01:14:24.750
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

1874
01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:01.960
<v Speaker 2>do a Q and a with the questions and hopefully you guys do over the Internet.</v>

1875
01:15:02.830 --> 01:15:04.810
<v Speaker 2>We've got a few things I can go over it very quickly.</v>

1876
01:15:04.811 --> 01:15:05.650
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

1877
01:15:06.300 --> 01:15:08.980
<v Speaker 2>the shows us 48 or 49,</v>

1878
01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:11.150
<v Speaker 2>I believe when this tour every night,</v>

1879
01:15:11.300 --> 01:15:12.510
<v Speaker 2>a very different lecture.</v>

1880
01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:15.190
<v Speaker 2>So we are in London tomorrow night,</v>

1881
01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:16.053
<v Speaker 2>Ontario.</v>

1882
01:15:16.590 --> 01:15:17.380
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1883
01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:18.220
<v Speaker 2>you want me to join us in?</v>

1884
01:15:18.221 --> 01:15:19.360
<v Speaker 2>Both were in London,</v>

1885
01:15:19.361 --> 01:15:19.721
<v Speaker 2>England,</v>

1886
01:15:19.721 --> 01:15:21.690
<v Speaker 2>and the October we're in Kitchener,</v>

1887
01:15:21.730 --> 01:15:22.670
<v Speaker 2>then the following night,</v>

1888
01:15:22.690 --> 01:15:23.870
<v Speaker 2>there are still tickets available.</v>

1889
01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:25.240
<v Speaker 2>Let me come see us there.</v>

1890
01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:25.880
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1891
01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:28.810
<v Speaker 2>this door will continue to the u s and some timber,</v>

1892
01:15:28.930 --> 01:15:29.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1893
01:15:29.470 --> 01:15:31.030
<v Speaker 2>the UK in October and hopefully,</v>

1894
01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:31.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1895
01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:32.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1896
01:15:32.230 --> 01:15:35.020
<v Speaker 2>abroad in 2019.</v>

1897
01:15:35.021 --> 01:15:38.950
<v Speaker 2>And the thing is voting for your translation with multiple languages and it has</v>

1898
01:15:38.951 --> 01:15:39.970
<v Speaker 2>really a phenomenon.</v>

1899
01:15:39.971 --> 01:15:41.620
<v Speaker 2>So you also mentioned,</v>

1900
01:15:41.621 --> 01:15:42.061
<v Speaker 2>I believe this,</v>

1901
01:15:42.061 --> 01:15:45.050
<v Speaker 2>some offering a program offering dotcom.</v>

1902
01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:48.310
<v Speaker 2>If you go there and the code to the 12 rules,</v>

1903
01:15:48.430 --> 01:15:50.800
<v Speaker 2>you can get up to 50% off,</v>

1904
01:15:50.801 --> 01:15:54.220
<v Speaker 2>5% off on the self authoring program.</v>

1905
01:15:54.250 --> 01:15:55.480
<v Speaker 2>Highly recommend that.</v>

1906
01:15:55.570 --> 01:15:56.403
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1907
01:15:56.590 --> 01:15:58.810
<v Speaker 2>And now with no further ado,</v>

1908
01:15:58.811 --> 01:16:01.030
<v Speaker 2>please don't think that will come back to the stage.</v>

1909
01:16:01.330 --> 01:16:06.330
<v Speaker 2>Dr. Jordan [inaudible].</v>

1910
01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:22.720
<v Speaker 2>So someone named Zachary Henderson said in Europe,</v>

1911
01:16:23.590 --> 01:16:26.740
<v Speaker 2>who is the handsomest man in the front row tonight?</v>

1912
01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:31.800
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

1913
01:16:37.450 --> 01:16:38.650
<v Speaker 2>anonymous sense.</v>

1914
01:16:38.930 --> 01:16:39.550
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1915
01:16:39.550 --> 01:16:41.050
<v Speaker 2>do you believe in aliens?</v>

1916
01:16:43.090 --> 01:16:43.601
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1917
01:16:43.601 --> 01:16:48.601
<v Speaker 2>but they exist whether I believe the number of [inaudible].</v>

1918
01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:02.560
<v Speaker 2>So someone said,</v>

1919
01:17:02.590 --> 01:17:07.590
<v Speaker 2>how do you reconcile the very strong interest in your work with what is</v>

1920
01:17:09.261 --> 01:17:10.000
<v Speaker 2>otherwise in general,</v>

1921
01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.890
<v Speaker 4>generally have an aesthetic and a disengaged approach to life.</v>

1922
01:17:13.670 --> 01:17:16.700
<v Speaker 4>So someone that's an island stuff first,</v>

1923
01:17:18.140 --> 01:17:18.440
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1924
01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:19.273
<v Speaker 4>Because</v>

1925
01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:21.350
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1926
01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:26.350
<v Speaker 4>there's kind of two broad categories of existential catastrophe and one would be</v>

1927
01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:32.680
<v Speaker 4>the escape into totalitarianism that sort of crushes with its strictures.</v>

1928
01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:39.830
<v Speaker 4>And the other is to let everything fall apart and to become a nihilistic.</v>

1929
01:17:39.831 --> 01:17:43.310
<v Speaker 4>And the nihilistic attitude is generating,</v>

1930
01:17:43.311 --> 01:17:48.311
<v Speaker 4>predicated on the presumption now in life is fundamentally meaningless.</v>

1931
01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:55.840
<v Speaker 4>There's no superordinate meaning and because life is short and painful and so</v>

1932
01:17:58.830 --> 01:17:59.663
<v Speaker 4>forth.</v>

1933
01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:05.120
<v Speaker 4>And I think the answer to that is,</v>

1934
01:18:05.870 --> 01:18:06.500
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1935
01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:11.420
<v Speaker 4>the process of discovering because you can discover the point.</v>

1936
01:18:12.490 --> 01:18:13.323
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1937
01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:16.340
<v Speaker 4>but you have to first of all,</v>

1938
01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:19.040
<v Speaker 4>assuming that you're too ignorant to begin with,</v>

1939
01:18:19.041 --> 01:18:24.041
<v Speaker 4>to know what it is and also to question your doubt itself.</v>

1940
01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:26.990
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1941
01:18:26.990 --> 01:18:30.380
<v Speaker 4>because if you believe that place is pointless,</v>

1942
01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:33.800
<v Speaker 4>then you believe that what you believe is correct.</v>

1943
01:18:34.910 --> 01:18:36.590
<v Speaker 4>And that means you believe your beliefs.</v>

1944
01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:42.280
<v Speaker 4>And it seems to me that you probably not smart enough to unquestioning belief</v>

1945
01:18:43.281 --> 01:18:44.150
<v Speaker 4>your beliefs.</v>

1946
01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:45.760
<v Speaker 4>And you might start with a question,</v>

1947
01:18:45.761 --> 01:18:46.730
<v Speaker 4>can your doubt,</v>

1948
01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:48.470
<v Speaker 4>why do we go with that?</v>

1949
01:18:48.471 --> 01:18:50.090
<v Speaker 4>Life has meaning.</v>

1950
01:18:50.630 --> 01:18:50.721
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1951
01:18:50.721 --> 01:18:51.201
<v Speaker 4>you might say,</v>

1952
01:18:51.201 --> 01:18:51.620
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1953
01:18:51.620 --> 01:18:54.500
<v Speaker 4>it's just self evident given its suffering infinity.</v>

1954
01:18:54.890 --> 01:18:55.251
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1955
01:18:55.251 --> 01:18:55.761
<v Speaker 4>well no,</v>

1956
01:18:55.761 --> 01:18:57.200
<v Speaker 4>that's not so self evident.</v>

1957
01:18:57.230 --> 01:18:59.330
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you're just useless near responsible.</v>

1958
01:18:59.331 --> 01:19:04.240
<v Speaker 4>And you're justifying that by making the cakes that life has made less</v>

1959
01:19:04.250 --> 01:19:04.500
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

1960
01:19:04.500 --> 01:19:07.460
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to do anything and you don't have to bear any responsibility.</v>

1961
01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:10.790
<v Speaker 4>That's actually quite helpful if you discover that because you think that</v>

1962
01:19:11.060 --> 01:19:13.910
<v Speaker 4>everything is pointless and horrible and it's just that you're useless and</v>

1963
01:19:13.911 --> 01:19:18.040
<v Speaker 4>that's way better because if you're just used to us,</v>

1964
01:19:18.041 --> 01:19:19.670
<v Speaker 4>you could forget and fix that.</v>

1965
01:19:19.671 --> 01:19:21.260
<v Speaker 4>But if life was pointless and horrible,</v>

1966
01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:22.580
<v Speaker 4>then you basically do.</v>

1967
01:19:22.850 --> 01:19:26.270
<v Speaker 4>So you can substitute nihilism for humility.</v>

1968
01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:29.000
<v Speaker 4>You can substitute humility for nihilism.</v>

1969
01:19:29.660 --> 01:19:31.190
<v Speaker 4>That would be a good start.</v>

1970
01:19:31.730 --> 01:19:36.730
<v Speaker 4>And then the first to ask this question obviously has a genuinely empathetic and</v>

1971
01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:38.300
<v Speaker 4>disadvantaged approach to life,</v>

1972
01:19:38.630 --> 01:19:43.010
<v Speaker 4>but finds that they're very strongly interested in my work.</v>

1973
01:19:43.011 --> 01:19:43.281
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

1974
01:19:43.281 --> 01:19:48.230
<v Speaker 4>So then the first thing can do that is to notice that you're not</v>

1975
01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:51.790
<v Speaker 4>completely empathetic in this occasion.</v>

1976
01:19:52.070 --> 01:19:53.150
<v Speaker 4>You're apathetic condition,</v>

1977
01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:58.010
<v Speaker 4>but there's some spark in the darkness and you don't know why.</v>

1978
01:19:58.070 --> 01:20:02.420
<v Speaker 4>I could stare at east and this is a useful thing if you're feeling hopeless.</v>

1979
01:20:02.570 --> 01:20:02.991
<v Speaker 4>And I mean,</v>

1980
01:20:02.991 --> 01:20:06.090
<v Speaker 4>there's lots of reasons why someone might be feeling hopeless and sometimes when</v>

1981
01:20:06.091 --> 01:20:09.450
<v Speaker 4>people are feeling hopeless because they're physically ill in one matter.</v>

1982
01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:13.160
<v Speaker 4>So I'm not thinking about this as a universal panacea.</v>

1983
01:20:13.180 --> 01:20:15.360
<v Speaker 4>I know there's lots of reasons for being depressed.</v>

1984
01:20:15.710 --> 01:20:16.540
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1985
01:20:16.540 --> 01:20:17.071
<v Speaker 4>and that,</v>

1986
01:20:17.071 --> 01:20:20.040
<v Speaker 4>that's not that easy to distinguish from being nihilistic.</v>

1987
01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:24.330
<v Speaker 4>But if you notice that there are some things that grip you,</v>

1988
01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:27.120
<v Speaker 4>that's a useful place to start.</v>

1989
01:20:27.270 --> 01:20:28.080
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1990
01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:28.471
<v Speaker 4>Oh look,</v>

1991
01:20:28.471 --> 01:20:29.580
<v Speaker 4>I'm interested in something.</v>

1992
01:20:30.220 --> 01:20:31.410
<v Speaker 4>Well that's a mystery,</v>

1993
01:20:31.710 --> 01:20:32.240
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1994
01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:34.530
<v Speaker 4>Cause you can't make yourself interested in something.</v>

1995
01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:39.150
<v Speaker 4>You can notice that they were interested in something and then you can pursue</v>

1996
01:20:39.151 --> 01:20:39.630
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1997
01:20:39.630 --> 01:20:40.860
<v Speaker 4>Interest to sort of like,</v>

1998
01:20:41.130 --> 01:20:41.970
<v Speaker 4>it's like a beacon.</v>

1999
01:20:41.971 --> 01:20:43.380
<v Speaker 4>The clippers in the darkness.</v>

2000
01:20:43.381 --> 01:20:44.970
<v Speaker 4>If you follow what you're interested in,</v>

2001
01:20:45.180 --> 01:20:47.760
<v Speaker 4>especially if you do an honest action.</v>

2002
01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:48.733
<v Speaker 4>A crucial,</v>

2003
01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:51.090
<v Speaker 4>which is why I wrote rule eight,</v>

2004
01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:53.250
<v Speaker 4>tell the truth or at least a lie.</v>

2005
01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:54.780
<v Speaker 4>If you're going to follow when you're interested in,</v>

2006
01:20:54.781 --> 01:20:55.810
<v Speaker 4>then you've been an [inaudible].</v>

2007
01:20:55.860 --> 01:20:56.671
<v Speaker 4>Because if you lie,</v>

2008
01:20:56.671 --> 01:20:59.040
<v Speaker 4>you have fun with John is the mechanism of interest.</v>

2009
01:20:59.041 --> 01:21:00.770
<v Speaker 4>And then it lead you off of cliffs.</v>

2010
01:21:01.140 --> 01:21:02.880
<v Speaker 4>So if you're gonna follow what you're interested in,</v>

2011
01:21:02.881 --> 01:21:05.880
<v Speaker 4>that you've been in the audience because otherwise you're following someone</v>

2012
01:21:05.881 --> 01:21:06.840
<v Speaker 4>dishonest.</v>

2013
01:21:07.020 --> 01:21:08.220
<v Speaker 4>That's a very bad idea.</v>

2014
01:21:08.850 --> 01:21:09.270
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2015
01:21:09.270 --> 01:21:10.051
<v Speaker 4>but in any case,</v>

2016
01:21:10.051 --> 01:21:12.000
<v Speaker 4>if you don't notice that you're interested in something,</v>

2017
01:21:12.450 --> 01:21:14.430
<v Speaker 4>even if you're interested in something like music,</v>

2018
01:21:14.431 --> 01:21:15.420
<v Speaker 4>I don't care what it is,</v>

2019
01:21:15.421 --> 01:21:16.680
<v Speaker 4>if you're interested in something,</v>

2020
01:21:17.010 --> 01:21:19.230
<v Speaker 4>then that thing that you're interested in in guidance,</v>

2021
01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:23.090
<v Speaker 4>you know what we need in the Harry Potter movies there,</v>

2022
01:21:23.170 --> 01:21:25.020
<v Speaker 4>they played that quidditch game.</v>

2023
01:21:25.830 --> 01:21:28.770
<v Speaker 4>And you know that's a funny game because there's the normal game,</v>

2024
01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:30.630
<v Speaker 4>sort of like basketball.</v>

2025
01:21:30.660 --> 01:21:35.660
<v Speaker 4>So if you played on brooms and then there's a game that rises out of that,</v>

2026
01:21:36.601 --> 01:21:38.340
<v Speaker 4>which is the gate of the secrets play,</v>

2027
01:21:38.670 --> 01:21:39.660
<v Speaker 4>there's two secrets.</v>

2028
01:21:39.661 --> 01:21:42.170
<v Speaker 4>And they chased this little ball with wings on it.</v>

2029
01:21:42.490 --> 01:21:45.930
<v Speaker 4>That's actually an ancient symbol as the hell chemical chaos.</v>

2030
01:21:45.931 --> 01:21:46.710
<v Speaker 4>And it's uh,</v>

2031
01:21:46.710 --> 01:21:49.320
<v Speaker 4>it's the container of the unrevealed world.</v>

2032
01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:50.011
<v Speaker 4>That's what the hell,</v>

2033
01:21:50.011 --> 01:21:50.821
<v Speaker 4>chemical chaos.</v>

2034
01:21:50.821 --> 01:21:53.820
<v Speaker 4>Cause that's what that stitches interesting way.</v>

2035
01:21:53.830 --> 01:21:54.180
<v Speaker 4>How Fun.</v>

2036
01:21:54.180 --> 01:21:56.920
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how they helped JK Rowling ever figured that out,</v>

2037
01:21:56.921 --> 01:21:57.271
<v Speaker 4>I think is,</v>

2038
01:21:57.271 --> 01:21:59.010
<v Speaker 4>it's unbelievably obscure knowns.</v>

2039
01:21:59.011 --> 01:22:04.011
<v Speaker 4>But she gets figured out and the secrets chased that and that thing flipped</v>

2040
01:22:04.381 --> 01:22:04.801
<v Speaker 4>around,</v>

2041
01:22:04.801 --> 01:22:05.010
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2042
01:22:05.010 --> 01:22:05.601
<v Speaker 4>And it goes ever.</v>

2043
01:22:05.601 --> 01:22:06.540
<v Speaker 4>It's like a mercury,</v>

2044
01:22:06.541 --> 01:22:08.250
<v Speaker 4>the winged messenger of the gods.</v>

2045
01:22:08.251 --> 01:22:09.240
<v Speaker 4>It's the same idea.</v>

2046
01:22:09.810 --> 01:22:12.690
<v Speaker 4>And the secrets follow this thing that fits around,</v>

2047
01:22:12.691 --> 01:22:16.440
<v Speaker 4>that's a Goldman glitters and bleed and that's meaning itself.</v>

2048
01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:21.300
<v Speaker 4>And the idea that's expressed in the game of quidditch is that the person who</v>

2049
01:22:21.301 --> 01:22:26.190
<v Speaker 4>pursues meaning and fights and is when something of such colossal magnitude that</v>

2050
01:22:26.220 --> 01:22:30.350
<v Speaker 4>the entire game is that everyone who was blame,</v>

2051
01:22:32.250 --> 01:22:37.250
<v Speaker 4>something of such a colossal magnitude that he is declared victorious right at</v>

2052
01:22:37.621 --> 01:22:38.340
<v Speaker 4>that moment.</v>

2053
01:22:38.340 --> 01:22:41.940
<v Speaker 4>That's really what that is symbolizing in the structure of the movie,</v>

2054
01:22:41.941 --> 01:22:42.721
<v Speaker 4>which is so cool.</v>

2055
01:22:42.721 --> 01:22:45.690
<v Speaker 4>But you manage that and it's such as such as stroke of genius,</v>

2056
01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:47.460
<v Speaker 4>but you can do that in your life.</v>

2057
01:22:47.490 --> 01:22:47.701
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2058
01:22:47.701 --> 01:22:50.630
<v Speaker 4>there'll be things that glimmer in glitter for you in the darkness.</v>

2059
01:22:50.631 --> 01:22:52.170
<v Speaker 4>And you said,</v>

2060
01:22:52.470 --> 01:22:53.530
<v Speaker 4>Andrew is a person.</v>

2061
01:22:53.790 --> 01:22:54.810
<v Speaker 4>How's this question,</v>

2062
01:22:55.290 --> 01:22:56.123
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2063
01:22:56.130 --> 01:22:59.790
<v Speaker 4>that you hit and you have a strong interest in my work?</v>

2064
01:22:59.850 --> 01:23:01.740
<v Speaker 4>Well then I would say be a little more precise.</v>

2065
01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:03.840
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2066
01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:04.321
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

2067
01:23:04.321 --> 01:23:06.750
<v Speaker 4>What is it that you're interested in or decisive?</v>

2068
01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:09.160
<v Speaker 4>What is it that's gathering your attention?</v>

2069
01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:11.720
<v Speaker 4>Because that's up marker to the,</v>

2070
01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:13.150
<v Speaker 4>that's a door.</v>

2071
01:23:13.150 --> 01:23:16.270
<v Speaker 4>That's the doorway through which you must pass into your life.</v>

2072
01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:17.650
<v Speaker 4>That's what that is.</v>

2073
01:23:17.830 --> 01:23:19.660
<v Speaker 4>And that's what meaning marks out for me.</v>

2074
01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:20.740
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2075
01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:22.180
<v Speaker 4>it's likely we see,</v>

2076
01:23:22.181 --> 01:23:24.610
<v Speaker 4>we see in front of us a set of doors,</v>

2077
01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:25.360
<v Speaker 4>so that's the,</v>

2078
01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:29.430
<v Speaker 4>that's the world in front of us is an infinite set of doorways and,</v>

2079
01:23:29.431 --> 01:23:33.250
<v Speaker 4>and we can open the doorways and all sorts of things will come out.</v>

2080
01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:37.870
<v Speaker 4>We don't face some that were not determined by the material reality around us,</v>

2081
01:23:38.170 --> 01:23:41.890
<v Speaker 4>but we are to some degree that isn't the world that confronts us.</v>

2082
01:23:41.910 --> 01:23:46.150
<v Speaker 4>The world that confronts us is a vast expansive potential and possibility.</v>

2083
01:23:46.151 --> 01:23:48.880
<v Speaker 4>You all know that I can wake up in the morning and you think,</v>

2084
01:23:49.060 --> 01:23:52.810
<v Speaker 4>well there are things to do or there are ways that I can behave that will</v>

2085
01:23:52.811 --> 01:23:54.220
<v Speaker 4>produce certain consequences,</v>

2086
01:23:54.221 --> 01:23:55.510
<v Speaker 4>some negative.</v>

2087
01:23:55.510 --> 01:23:56.420
<v Speaker 4>It's a positive.</v>

2088
01:23:56.710 --> 01:24:00.350
<v Speaker 4>It's this expansive potential and that was certainly what you in front of them</v>

2089
01:24:00.490 --> 01:24:04.930
<v Speaker 4>as a human being is you confront the expensive potential with your consciousness</v>

2090
01:24:04.931 --> 01:24:08.470
<v Speaker 4>and your consciousness is exactly that which transformed that potential into</v>

2091
01:24:08.590 --> 01:24:13.590
<v Speaker 4>actuality and your moral and your moral and your morality determines whether you</v>

2092
01:24:16.781 --> 01:24:21.540
<v Speaker 4>transformed that potential into a good world or a bad word.</v>

2093
01:24:21.970 --> 01:24:23.040
<v Speaker 4>And you all know that too,</v>

2094
01:24:23.050 --> 01:24:25.840
<v Speaker 4>because you know that you can make bad decisions and make things worse and you</v>

2095
01:24:25.841 --> 01:24:28.060
<v Speaker 4>could make their decisions and make things better.</v>

2096
01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:30.070
<v Speaker 4>And so that's an actual too,</v>

2097
01:24:30.071 --> 01:24:35.071
<v Speaker 4>that's an echo of what happens in genesis when God creates the world of chaos is</v>

2098
01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:38.050
<v Speaker 4>it's a decision to,</v>

2099
01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:42.570
<v Speaker 4>to speak the truth and to interact with the Kaylyn jumps on to produce having</v>

2100
01:24:42.670 --> 01:24:43.503
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible].</v>

2101
01:24:43.750 --> 01:24:45.640
<v Speaker 4>It's in that image that were made.</v>

2102
01:24:45.670 --> 01:24:46.780
<v Speaker 4>That's the story.</v>

2103
01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:48.010
<v Speaker 4>It's a great story.</v>

2104
01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:51.370
<v Speaker 4>And we all believe it cause we treat each other like that and predicated or into</v>

2105
01:24:51.371 --> 01:24:52.660
<v Speaker 4>our political system.</v>

2106
01:24:52.660 --> 01:24:54.550
<v Speaker 4>And the idea that that's what we are.</v>

2107
01:24:54.970 --> 01:24:55.721
<v Speaker 4>And then you might say,</v>

2108
01:24:55.721 --> 01:24:59.500
<v Speaker 4>well how will it was due doorways in front of you and which one should you open?</v>

2109
01:24:59.501 --> 01:25:00.191
<v Speaker 4>That's her as well.</v>

2110
01:25:00.191 --> 01:25:00.920
<v Speaker 4>How about the people?</v>

2111
01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:04.570
<v Speaker 4>But the one that clips and it attracts your attention.</v>

2112
01:25:04.810 --> 01:25:07.030
<v Speaker 4>And that's a deep manifestation of the instincts,</v>

2113
01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:07.421
<v Speaker 4>the meeting.</v>

2114
01:25:07.421 --> 01:25:12.100
<v Speaker 4>And so something beckons t and then you can open it and then something comes out</v>

2115
01:25:12.101 --> 01:25:12.550
<v Speaker 4>of it.</v>

2116
01:25:12.550 --> 01:25:13.900
<v Speaker 4>And that changes everything.</v>

2117
01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:15.850
<v Speaker 4>And then what beckons will change.</v>

2118
01:25:15.910 --> 01:25:17.830
<v Speaker 4>And that's what happens when you follow your instinct.</v>

2119
01:25:17.831 --> 01:25:18.664
<v Speaker 4>For meeting,</v>

2120
01:25:19.020 --> 01:25:20.830
<v Speaker 4>but you have to be humbled to do that.</v>

2121
01:25:21.490 --> 01:25:24.850
<v Speaker 4>You have to be willing to see what it is that glitters of the darkness and you</v>

2122
01:25:24.851 --> 01:25:29.020
<v Speaker 4>have to lower yourself so that you're willing to pursue it because it won't be</v>

2123
01:25:29.021 --> 01:25:31.870
<v Speaker 4>something high and mighty to begin with because why the hell should it be if you</v>

2124
01:25:31.871 --> 01:25:35.170
<v Speaker 4>don't know what you're doing and you don't know who you are and you're enveloped</v>

2125
01:25:35.171 --> 01:25:37.360
<v Speaker 4>in chaos and you're at your,</v>

2126
01:25:37.690 --> 01:25:38.350
<v Speaker 4>what would you say?</v>

2127
01:25:38.350 --> 01:25:38.861
<v Speaker 4>Hopeless.</v>

2128
01:25:38.861 --> 01:25:40.210
<v Speaker 4>And I'm disciplined than useless.</v>

2129
01:25:40.211 --> 01:25:44.350
<v Speaker 4>Why would something magnificent manifest itself for you to begin when it's</v>

2130
01:25:44.351 --> 01:25:47.820
<v Speaker 4>supposed to be something small enough so someone like you would have to get on</v>

2131
01:25:47.821 --> 01:25:48.770
<v Speaker 4>their hands and knees to,</v>

2132
01:25:49.090 --> 01:25:49.923
<v Speaker 4>to approach.</v>

2133
01:25:50.830 --> 01:25:52.360
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you have to clean up your room.</v>

2134
01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:56.170
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you have to scrape the dust bunnies underneath your bed.</v>

2135
01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:57.153
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2136
01:25:57.160 --> 01:26:00.640
<v Speaker 4>maybe you have to do those things that you know you should do that you've been</v>

2137
01:26:00.641 --> 01:26:02.380
<v Speaker 4>putting off because they're beneath you.</v>

2138
01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:02.801
<v Speaker 4>It's no,</v>

2139
01:26:02.801 --> 01:26:04.400
<v Speaker 4>they're now,</v>

2140
01:26:04.450 --> 01:26:09.430
<v Speaker 4>I haven't no money or exactly what you have for is go have no matter how small.</v>

2141
01:26:10.810 --> 01:26:14.330
<v Speaker 4>And so you would talk to your responsibility and you follow it.</v>

2142
01:26:14.331 --> 01:26:17.570
<v Speaker 4>Beckons is meaningful and you do that.</v>

2143
01:26:17.740 --> 01:26:21.110
<v Speaker 4>And humility knowing that you're not in a position to judge the world and you</v>

2144
01:26:21.111 --> 01:26:21.944
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

2145
01:26:23.270 --> 01:26:25.930
<v Speaker 4>I haven't generally apathetic and distribution approach to life,</v>

2146
01:26:25.940 --> 01:26:30.630
<v Speaker 4>it's like well what makes you think you're a reliable structure meeting?</v>

2147
01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:32.240
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

2148
01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:33.230
<v Speaker 4>It's a good question.</v>

2149
01:26:36.410 --> 01:26:40.820
<v Speaker 4>So before you dismiss the cost monks as insignificant,</v>

2150
01:26:41.570 --> 01:26:45.230
<v Speaker 4>you might want to make sure that you put yourself together to the degree that</v>

2151
01:26:45.231 --> 01:26:46.064
<v Speaker 4>you can,</v>

2152
01:26:46.540 --> 01:26:48.720
<v Speaker 4>cause you may be missing something you never know.</v>

2153
01:26:49.830 --> 01:26:54.830
<v Speaker 4>So [inaudible]</v>

2154
01:27:09.670 --> 01:27:10.503
<v Speaker 4>does</v>

2155
01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:14.390
<v Speaker 4>everything you believe makes you hopeless.</v>

2156
01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:18.530
<v Speaker 4>Then maybe you would question the utility of what you believe.</v>

2157
01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:28.820
<v Speaker 4>And I ran in a cocktail hour,</v>

2158
01:27:30.710 --> 01:27:31.660
<v Speaker 4>cocktail hour,</v>

2159
01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:33.560
<v Speaker 4>a woman talks to a psychiatrist,</v>

2160
01:27:33.561 --> 01:27:34.530
<v Speaker 4>I believe that a party,</v>

2161
01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:36.200
<v Speaker 4>hence the cocktail hour.</v>

2162
01:27:36.570 --> 01:27:40.250
<v Speaker 4>And she's trying to ask him for professional advice and she says,</v>

2163
01:27:40.251 --> 01:27:40.431
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2164
01:27:40.431 --> 01:27:44.060
<v Speaker 4>I'm having a pretty rough time in my life is not what it should be.</v>

2165
01:27:44.310 --> 01:27:46.020
<v Speaker 4>If I'm suffering from Marilyn</v>

2166
01:27:47.570 --> 01:27:49.790
<v Speaker 4>and I really hope there's something wrong with me.</v>

2167
01:27:50.190 --> 01:27:54.860
<v Speaker 4>And the psychiatrist is sort of taken aback but there's something wrong with</v>

2168
01:27:54.861 --> 01:27:55.061
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

2169
01:27:55.061 --> 01:27:55.581
<v Speaker 4>And she says,</v>

2170
01:27:55.581 --> 01:27:56.414
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2171
01:27:57.110 --> 01:27:58.060
<v Speaker 4>as far as I can tell him,</v>

2172
01:27:58.070 --> 01:27:59.660
<v Speaker 4>it's only two possibilities.</v>

2173
01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:03.260
<v Speaker 4>Either there's something wrong with me and that's why I'm suffering</v>

2174
01:28:04.460 --> 01:28:05.293
<v Speaker 4>unsupportive.</v>

2175
01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:08.840
<v Speaker 4>Or there's something wrong with the structure of existence and that's why I'm</v>

2176
01:28:08.841 --> 01:28:09.890
<v Speaker 4>suffering.</v>

2177
01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:13.460
<v Speaker 4>And if there's something wrong with the structure and existence,</v>

2178
01:28:13.461 --> 01:28:16.280
<v Speaker 4>well then what am I going to do?</v>

2179
01:28:17.140 --> 01:28:17.973
<v Speaker 4>Nothing.</v>

2180
01:28:19.130 --> 01:28:20.990
<v Speaker 4>But if there's something wrong with me,</v>

2181
01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:22.330
<v Speaker 4>then I can fix it.</v>

2182
01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:26.300
<v Speaker 4>And so that's chapter six,</v>

2183
01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:29.570
<v Speaker 4>which is the dark chapter in 12 months.</v>

2184
01:28:29.571 --> 01:28:32.730
<v Speaker 4>Your life is to meditation on the motivation of people who do such things as</v>

2185
01:28:32.731 --> 01:28:34.100
<v Speaker 4>shoot up elementary schools.</v>

2186
01:28:35.030 --> 01:28:39.800
<v Speaker 4>And the rule is put your house in perfect order before you criticize the world.</v>

2187
01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:43.760
<v Speaker 4>And if everything is around you was meaningless because of your beliefs.</v>

2188
01:28:43.761 --> 01:28:45.140
<v Speaker 4>The first thing you might think as well,</v>

2189
01:28:45.141 --> 01:28:47.390
<v Speaker 4>maybe it's your beliefs and not the world.</v>

2190
01:28:48.430 --> 01:28:49.820
<v Speaker 4>And so that's,</v>

2191
01:28:50.030 --> 01:28:51.020
<v Speaker 4>that's not believable.</v>

2192
01:28:51.021 --> 01:28:52.860
<v Speaker 4>Helpful thing to realize.</v>

2193
01:28:52.861 --> 01:28:54.080
<v Speaker 4>You've been dealt with your own</v>

2194
01:28:58.460 --> 01:29:01.940
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible]</v>

2195
01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:12.113
<v Speaker 4>on</v>

2196
01:29:14.310 --> 01:29:15.143
<v Speaker 4>your website.</v>

2197
01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:23.760
<v Speaker 4>I'm six foot piece of art,</v>

2198
01:29:25.510 --> 01:29:27.960
<v Speaker 4>so that's about six feet square.</v>

2199
01:29:28.050 --> 01:29:33.050
<v Speaker 4>It's made for cases like the labyrinth that I've described and it's later.</v>

2200
01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:39.720
<v Speaker 4>It's fun and it's a bit of a quarter inch layer of some full course,</v>

2201
01:29:39.871 --> 01:29:44.871
<v Speaker 4>full court to say it's a labor room start foam with a layer of paper on each</v>

2202
01:29:45.571 --> 01:29:46.410
<v Speaker 4>side and the software,</v>

2203
01:29:46.420 --> 01:29:47.253
<v Speaker 4>new institute</v>

2204
01:29:48.930 --> 01:29:52.740
<v Speaker 4>as backing for prints and so forth or frame Darren works.</v>

2205
01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:56.060
<v Speaker 4>But I decided about the 1980s with,</v>

2206
01:29:56.080 --> 01:30:00.780
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to make foam core sculptures that were half sculpture and have</v>

2207
01:30:00.830 --> 01:30:01.663
<v Speaker 4>pagans.</v>

2208
01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:06.060
<v Speaker 4>I made half a dozen of them before I ended up doing other things.</v>

2209
01:30:06.270 --> 01:30:11.270
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things that I made back then was this sculpture that I called the</v>

2210
01:30:11.371 --> 01:30:12.420
<v Speaker 4>meaning of music.</v>

2211
01:30:12.870 --> 01:30:15.870
<v Speaker 4>And I was really interested in music at that point,</v>

2212
01:30:16.230 --> 01:30:20.930
<v Speaker 4>partly because I was trying to sort out the phenomenology of meaning.</v>

2213
01:30:21.460 --> 01:30:24.270
<v Speaker 4>What is meaning and is it something real?</v>

2214
01:30:24.530 --> 01:30:25.440
<v Speaker 4>If it's something real,</v>

2215
01:30:25.441 --> 01:30:28.710
<v Speaker 4>what does it represent or what is all of that?</v>

2216
01:30:28.770 --> 01:30:32.160
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things I had noticed was that people fall,</v>

2217
01:30:32.161 --> 01:30:34.560
<v Speaker 4>we music intrinsically meaningful.</v>

2218
01:30:34.890 --> 01:30:39.240
<v Speaker 4>And that was very interesting to me because even nihilistic people couldn't help</v>

2219
01:30:39.241 --> 01:30:41.070
<v Speaker 4>but find music meaningful.</v>

2220
01:30:41.430 --> 01:30:44.850
<v Speaker 4>And so it was 1983 or [inaudible] 84,</v>

2221
01:30:45.250 --> 01:30:45.870
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2222
01:30:45.870 --> 01:30:48.450
<v Speaker 4>punk rock movement was still pretty</v>

2223
01:30:50.220 --> 01:30:50.950
<v Speaker 4>powerful.</v>

2224
01:30:50.950 --> 01:30:54.840
<v Speaker 4>It's still a going concern that function like the sex pistols.</v>

2225
01:30:59.160 --> 01:30:59.993
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

2226
01:31:01.620 --> 01:31:04.430
<v Speaker 4>I noticed that even the nihilistic punk rock I just found there.</v>

2227
01:31:04.431 --> 01:31:05.264
<v Speaker 4>And nihilistic,</v>

2228
01:31:05.540 --> 01:31:06.930
<v Speaker 4>extremely meaningful,</v>

2229
01:31:07.170 --> 01:31:12.150
<v Speaker 4>which I thought was [inaudible] celebrating,</v>

2230
01:31:13.300 --> 01:31:13.800
<v Speaker 4>anarchic,</v>

2231
01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:14.431
<v Speaker 4>nihilism.</v>

2232
01:31:14.431 --> 01:31:16.040
<v Speaker 4>They were brilliant to their music.</v>

2233
01:31:16.250 --> 01:31:21.250
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] using these two because it's an art form and it goes underneath</v>

2234
01:31:22.171 --> 01:31:22.591
<v Speaker 4>thinking.</v>

2235
01:31:22.591 --> 01:31:24.450
<v Speaker 4>It's also a good antidote to,</v>

2236
01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:26.940
<v Speaker 4>to rational skepticism,</v>

2237
01:31:26.941 --> 01:31:30.330
<v Speaker 4>which is why music has become such a powerful force in our culture.</v>

2238
01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:31.710
<v Speaker 4>People love music.</v>

2239
01:31:31.711 --> 01:31:33.680
<v Speaker 4>And I think without music,</v>

2240
01:31:33.780 --> 01:31:35.420
<v Speaker 4>any people just died.</v>

2241
01:31:36.350 --> 01:31:40.570
<v Speaker 4>And it's because music speaks of meaning directly.</v>

2242
01:31:40.700 --> 01:31:42.150
<v Speaker 4>Like when you listen to music,</v>

2243
01:31:42.151 --> 01:31:43.110
<v Speaker 4>when you're into it,</v>

2244
01:31:43.290 --> 01:31:44.360
<v Speaker 4>when you're enjoying it,</v>

2245
01:31:44.370 --> 01:31:45.570
<v Speaker 4>you're not really enjoying it.</v>

2246
01:31:45.571 --> 01:31:48.000
<v Speaker 4>You're finding the experience meaningful.</v>

2247
01:31:48.410 --> 01:31:49.243
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2248
01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:53.260
<v Speaker 4>and it's fun to watch people play music because they can train themselves,</v>

2249
01:31:53.810 --> 01:31:55.550
<v Speaker 4>watch people improvise,</v>

2250
01:31:55.580 --> 01:31:55.771
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2251
01:31:55.771 --> 01:32:00.250
<v Speaker 4>because they're all trained together and doing this normal thing.</v>

2252
01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:03.210
<v Speaker 4>They're all got the average where they shouldn't be there doing it beautiful</v>

2253
01:32:03.211 --> 01:32:03.790
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>

2254
01:32:03.790 --> 01:32:06.370
<v Speaker 4>So I talked a lot about what music represented.</v>

2255
01:32:08.180 --> 01:32:09.013
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2256
01:32:09.250 --> 01:32:10.890
<v Speaker 4>and I spent about four months making,</v>

2257
01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:15.190
<v Speaker 4>this is painting and I thought what are we trying to do is to make a piece of</v>

2258
01:32:15.191 --> 01:32:20.191
<v Speaker 4>art that represented visually what music represented in the auditory relevance.</v>

2259
01:32:21.161 --> 01:32:22.930
<v Speaker 4>So if you look at that local,</v>

2260
01:32:22.970 --> 01:32:24.560
<v Speaker 4>they'll see that it's like a neck Q,</v>

2261
01:32:24.590 --> 01:32:29.020
<v Speaker 4>but nick was really just one of those reversing cubes and I made the,</v>

2262
01:32:29.230 --> 01:32:34.230
<v Speaker 4>I made the painting so that you couldn't resolve at visually so that if you look</v>

2263
01:32:34.331 --> 01:32:34.650
<v Speaker 4>out,</v>

2264
01:32:34.650 --> 01:32:38.270
<v Speaker 4>if gaze at it without focusing too much on,</v>

2265
01:32:38.271 --> 01:32:39.370
<v Speaker 4>just see that it moves,</v>

2266
01:32:39.371 --> 01:32:39.821
<v Speaker 4>it moves,</v>

2267
01:32:39.821 --> 01:32:40.241
<v Speaker 4>moves,</v>

2268
01:32:40.241 --> 01:32:42.970
<v Speaker 4>moves as your brain tries to resolve what it is.</v>

2269
01:32:43.210 --> 01:32:48.210
<v Speaker 4>What it actually is is a cube set on an without with a tunnel about the mental,</v>

2270
01:32:49.570 --> 01:32:51.350
<v Speaker 4>it broken into four fragments.</v>

2271
01:32:52.150 --> 01:32:53.170
<v Speaker 4>Another thing that it is,</v>

2272
01:32:53.171 --> 01:32:54.004
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

2273
01:32:54.430 --> 01:32:58.840
<v Speaker 4>it's a three dimensional representation of a two dimensional representation of a</v>

2274
01:32:58.841 --> 01:33:00.220
<v Speaker 4>foreign object.</v>

2275
01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:03.360
<v Speaker 4>That's actually because music is a four dimensional object,</v>

2276
01:33:03.361 --> 01:33:03.650
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2277
01:33:03.650 --> 01:33:04.840
<v Speaker 4>Because it has three dimensions,</v>

2278
01:33:04.841 --> 01:33:09.430
<v Speaker 4>spatial spatial dimensions because you don't use it as rained in space.</v>

2279
01:33:09.580 --> 01:33:12.310
<v Speaker 4>That's what happens when you listen to stereo if see,</v>

2280
01:33:12.580 --> 01:33:14.920
<v Speaker 4>feel or hear how it's a rating space.</v>

2281
01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:17.320
<v Speaker 4>And then it just unfolds across time.</v>

2282
01:33:17.380 --> 01:33:18.970
<v Speaker 4>So it's got four dimensions.</v>

2283
01:33:19.540 --> 01:33:22.990
<v Speaker 4>And the reason music is meaningful and Mr [inaudible] an awful long time to</v>

2284
01:33:22.991 --> 01:33:27.991
<v Speaker 4>figure out is because the things that you see in the world that you think are</v>

2285
01:33:28.511 --> 01:33:29.950
<v Speaker 4>objects aren't objects.</v>

2286
01:33:29.951 --> 01:33:34.951
<v Speaker 4>They're actually patents and their patterns that you interact with in a manner</v>

2287
01:33:36.190 --> 01:33:37.750
<v Speaker 4>that makes them into tools.</v>

2288
01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:40.410
<v Speaker 4>And so often the tool,</v>

2289
01:33:40.420 --> 01:33:45.420
<v Speaker 4>so you're a pattern because you maintain your structure across time.</v>

2290
01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:49.480
<v Speaker 4>So that's about having something that big canes instructor across time.</v>

2291
01:33:50.170 --> 01:33:52.930
<v Speaker 4>And so all the things that we perceive,</v>

2292
01:33:52.931 --> 01:33:54.930
<v Speaker 4>our patterns and patterns,</v>

2293
01:33:55.240 --> 01:33:56.021
<v Speaker 4>all the patterns,</v>

2294
01:33:56.021 --> 01:33:57.060
<v Speaker 4>there's a world and there were many,</v>

2295
01:33:57.080 --> 01:33:59.080
<v Speaker 4>I mean you think about all the patterns here and they don't have,</v>

2296
01:33:59.081 --> 01:33:59.914
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2297
01:33:59.950 --> 01:34:02.800
<v Speaker 4>You go down to the subatomic level and there's an array of pallets,</v>

2298
01:34:02.801 --> 01:34:03.970
<v Speaker 4>and then above that,</v>

2299
01:34:03.971 --> 01:34:04.860
<v Speaker 4>at the atomic level,</v>

2300
01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:06.290
<v Speaker 4>there's another array of accountants.</v>

2301
01:34:06.310 --> 01:34:08.980
<v Speaker 4>And then at the molecular level there's another array of patterns.</v>

2302
01:34:08.981 --> 01:34:10.870
<v Speaker 4>And then your organs are patterns.</v>

2303
01:34:10.871 --> 01:34:11.671
<v Speaker 4>And then there's youth,</v>

2304
01:34:11.671 --> 01:34:12.291
<v Speaker 4>it's a powder.</v>

2305
01:34:12.291 --> 01:34:16.030
<v Speaker 4>And then there's you moving through space with all these other people.</v>

2306
01:34:16.031 --> 01:34:16.930
<v Speaker 4>And that's a pattern.</v>

2307
01:34:16.950 --> 01:34:19.240
<v Speaker 4>And then there's the political system.</v>

2308
01:34:19.300 --> 01:34:21.880
<v Speaker 4>Or let's say that the town that we're in and down,</v>

2309
01:34:21.890 --> 01:34:23.440
<v Speaker 4>some pattern in the political system,</v>

2310
01:34:23.441 --> 01:34:25.720
<v Speaker 4>not some pattern and the ecological system,</v>

2311
01:34:25.721 --> 01:34:26.560
<v Speaker 4>and that's a pattern.</v>

2312
01:34:26.561 --> 01:34:30.640
<v Speaker 4>And then there's the cosmos itself and that was a pattern and that's the harmony</v>

2313
01:34:30.641 --> 01:34:31.474
<v Speaker 4>of the spheres.</v>

2314
01:34:31.780 --> 01:34:36.340
<v Speaker 4>All those patterns are interacting in a harmonious way and that's what music</v>

2315
01:34:36.341 --> 01:34:37.270
<v Speaker 4>represents.</v>

2316
01:34:38.200 --> 01:34:41.590
<v Speaker 4>It represents the harmonious interaction of the patterns of the world.</v>

2317
01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:45.340
<v Speaker 4>And then when you go out to a bar and your doubts and what you're doing is</v>

2318
01:34:45.341 --> 01:34:48.370
<v Speaker 4>you're a regular body alone without pattern,</v>

2319
01:34:48.410 --> 01:34:51.990
<v Speaker 4>you find that deeply meaningful like you should because you shouldn't read the</v>

2320
01:34:51.991 --> 01:34:54.640
<v Speaker 4>body in alignment with the patterns of the world.</v>

2321
01:34:54.910 --> 01:34:58.130
<v Speaker 4>And then when you dance with someone else and maybe that was someone that you</v>

2322
01:34:58.131 --> 01:34:58.850
<v Speaker 4>love,</v>

2323
01:34:58.850 --> 01:35:03.850
<v Speaker 4>then you mutually produce a pattern and you're improvising with each other to</v>

2324
01:35:04.011 --> 01:35:08.390
<v Speaker 4>produce that pattern and your simultaneous aligning the pattern that you're both</v>

2325
01:35:08.391 --> 01:35:10.060
<v Speaker 4>producing with all the pack.</v>

2326
01:35:10.090 --> 01:35:11.390
<v Speaker 4>We all any of the music.</v>

2327
01:35:11.450 --> 01:35:13.400
<v Speaker 4>And so you're acting out the action,</v>

2328
01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:18.110
<v Speaker 4>you're acting out the act of engaging in a dialogue,</v>

2329
01:35:18.900 --> 01:35:19.570
<v Speaker 4>dialogue,</v>

2330
01:35:19.570 --> 01:35:20.403
<v Speaker 4>just dialed belt,</v>

2331
01:35:20.590 --> 01:35:20.801
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2332
01:35:20.801 --> 01:35:25.801
<v Speaker 4>So you're engaging in a dialogue that produces a pad that adapts you to the</v>

2333
01:35:26.361 --> 01:35:29.030
<v Speaker 4>structure of the patterns of the world and that's what you're doing and you're</v>

2334
01:35:29.031 --> 01:35:29.864
<v Speaker 4>dancing.</v>

2335
01:35:30.590 --> 01:35:33.710
<v Speaker 4>And so I figured all that out with regards to music and turned to portray that</v>

2336
01:35:33.711 --> 01:35:36.310
<v Speaker 4>in that logo and that simple.</v>

2337
01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:40.160
<v Speaker 4>And then since then I've been experimenting with that symbol joined to see how</v>

2338
01:35:40.161 --> 01:35:44.690
<v Speaker 4>many different forms I could get it to tenants as I can get it to manifest in</v>

2339
01:35:44.691 --> 01:35:45.530
<v Speaker 4>the world.</v>

2340
01:35:45.860 --> 01:35:47.770
<v Speaker 4>And so it's propagating like mad.</v>

2341
01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:51.350
<v Speaker 4>And that was part of what I wanted to do when I made 35 years ago.</v>

2342
01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:52.240
<v Speaker 4>I thought,</v>

2343
01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:55.310
<v Speaker 4>I'll make this thing and see how many different ways it will manifest itself in</v>

2344
01:35:55.311 --> 01:35:56.144
<v Speaker 4>the world.</v>

2345
01:35:56.450 --> 01:36:01.450
<v Speaker 4>So that's the story of the local [inaudible].</v>

2346
01:36:36.730 --> 01:36:37.610
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2347
01:36:39.250 --> 01:36:44.250
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible]</v>

2348
01:37:13.430 --> 01:37:14.263
<v Speaker 4>by</v>

2349
01:37:16.260 --> 01:37:17.020
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to be,</v>

2350
01:37:17.020 --> 01:37:18.650
<v Speaker 4>you're on someone's deathbed</v>

2351
01:37:22.290 --> 01:37:23.123
<v Speaker 4>even.</v>

2352
01:37:32.390 --> 01:37:35.960
<v Speaker 4>So you have to be extraordinarily careful with their terminology.</v>

2353
01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:39.860
<v Speaker 4>When people say that they want to be happening,</v>

2354
01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:40.401
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

2355
01:37:40.401 --> 01:37:41.234
<v Speaker 4>they don't mean that.</v>

2356
01:37:41.300 --> 01:37:42.560
<v Speaker 4>When you say you wouldn't be happy,</v>

2357
01:37:42.561 --> 01:37:44.090
<v Speaker 4>that's not actually what you mean.</v>

2358
01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:46.740
<v Speaker 4>There's plenty of psychological evidence that,</v>

2359
01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:49.160
<v Speaker 4>because if you take measures,</v>

2360
01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:51.320
<v Speaker 4>we all be,</v>

2361
01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:53.820
<v Speaker 4>and you analyze the statistics,</v>

2362
01:37:54.260 --> 01:37:58.590
<v Speaker 4>what you find is that when people really don't want is to be anxious and</v>

2363
01:37:58.591 --> 01:37:59.424
<v Speaker 4>impatient.</v>

2364
01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:04.890
<v Speaker 4>So happiness is a positive emotion over and above that.</v>

2365
01:38:04.891 --> 01:38:08.490
<v Speaker 4>But if you force people to make a trade on scale,</v>

2366
01:38:08.550 --> 01:38:11.130
<v Speaker 4>don't pick absence of misery and anxiety.</v>

2367
01:38:11.131 --> 01:38:11.520
<v Speaker 4>But that's,</v>

2368
01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:12.510
<v Speaker 4>that's the fundamental,</v>

2369
01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:14.370
<v Speaker 4>that's the fundamental motivation.</v>

2370
01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:15.751
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

2371
01:38:15.751 --> 01:38:18.920
<v Speaker 4>and then regards to happiness,</v>

2372
01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:21.720
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

2373
01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:23.980
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2374
01:38:23.980 --> 01:38:28.490
<v Speaker 4>Happiness is something that comes upon you if you're fortunate and it comes with</v>

2375
01:38:28.491 --> 01:38:31.090
<v Speaker 4>some more likely to come upon you with you're pursuing something that's</v>

2376
01:38:31.091 --> 01:38:32.920
<v Speaker 4>worthwhile and meaningful and awesome.</v>

2377
01:38:33.190 --> 01:38:34.023
<v Speaker 4>Awesome.</v>

2378
01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:38.680
<v Speaker 4>And the problem with assuming that the emotional state is actually the goal is</v>

2379
01:38:38.681 --> 01:38:42.160
<v Speaker 4>that when you're in situations where that emotional state can't possibly be the</v>

2380
01:38:42.161 --> 01:38:42.994
<v Speaker 4>goal,</v>

2381
01:38:43.090 --> 01:38:46.360
<v Speaker 4>and so that would be when you're dealing with the tragic reality in some fights</v>

2382
01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:49.420
<v Speaker 4>and your ethos is the pursuit of happiness.</v>

2383
01:38:49.421 --> 01:38:50.254
<v Speaker 4>That erm,</v>

2384
01:38:51.010 --> 01:38:51.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2385
01:38:51.430 --> 01:38:53.280
<v Speaker 4>let's set you up a sick child for three years,</v>

2386
01:38:53.290 --> 01:38:54.070
<v Speaker 4>four here.</v>

2387
01:38:54.070 --> 01:38:59.070
<v Speaker 4>More say good luck with your happiness hypothesis because that's not going to</v>

2388
01:39:00.491 --> 01:39:01.390
<v Speaker 4>get you through it.</v>

2389
01:39:03.770 --> 01:39:05.830
<v Speaker 4>And I'm not saying that you should be cyclical.</v>

2390
01:39:06.050 --> 01:39:06.880
<v Speaker 4>Happiness was it.</v>

2391
01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:09.040
<v Speaker 4>You should despise him if it comes your way.</v>

2392
01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:10.660
<v Speaker 4>But it's just not the problem.</v>

2393
01:39:11.830 --> 01:39:13.270
<v Speaker 4>It's not a noble pursuit.</v>

2394
01:39:13.271 --> 01:39:14.320
<v Speaker 4>And it will,</v>

2395
01:39:14.810 --> 01:39:18.890
<v Speaker 4>it will lead you burettes situations of dire necessity.</v>

2396
01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:23.680
<v Speaker 4>You need something much more profound and yourself in the world.</v>

2397
01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:28.870
<v Speaker 4>And that's why I talked more about suffering it malevolence cause those things</v>

2398
01:39:28.871 --> 01:39:33.390
<v Speaker 4>are undeniable and the cause and then do a bunch of trouble.</v>

2399
01:39:33.950 --> 01:39:38.950
<v Speaker 4>And at minimum you can orient yourself in the world cause you take game against</v>

2400
01:39:40.420 --> 01:39:42.380
<v Speaker 4>both of those and attempt to get sprayed them.</v>

2401
01:39:42.700 --> 01:39:45.730
<v Speaker 4>That's something you can do even in the most dire of circumstances.</v>

2402
01:39:45.731 --> 01:39:47.940
<v Speaker 4>And so if you're dealing with someone who's in pain on it,</v>

2403
01:39:48.310 --> 01:39:51.280
<v Speaker 4>if you're dealing with someone who's dying or you're dealing with the</v>

2404
01:39:51.281 --> 01:39:52.780
<v Speaker 4>catastrophes of your life,</v>

2405
01:39:53.350 --> 01:39:56.890
<v Speaker 4>you still have a meaningful option of trying to reduce the suffering to the,</v>

2406
01:39:56.980 --> 01:39:58.300
<v Speaker 4>to the maximum possible,</v>

2407
01:39:58.310 --> 01:39:59.143
<v Speaker 4>the great.</v>

2408
01:39:59.780 --> 01:40:01.390
<v Speaker 4>And that's a worthwhile endeavor.</v>

2409
01:40:03.460 --> 01:40:08.460
<v Speaker 4>And so it's a much more adult way of orienting yourself in the world.</v>

2410
01:40:08.890 --> 01:40:10.540
<v Speaker 4>And if happiness happens to come your way,</v>

2411
01:40:10.541 --> 01:40:12.790
<v Speaker 4>well then good for you to win.</v>

2412
01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:13.740
<v Speaker 4>It's not wonderful.</v>

2413
01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:15.150
<v Speaker 4>That's something to be thankful for,</v>

2414
01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:17.410
<v Speaker 4>but it's a side effect and not a person.</v>

2415
01:40:18.910 --> 01:40:21.460
<v Speaker 4>Damian says doing what you do must be stressful.</v>

2416
01:40:22.870 --> 01:40:24.460
<v Speaker 4>Shoghi one wine.</v>

2417
01:40:28.210 --> 01:40:30.030
<v Speaker 4>Why shoe shopping?</v>

2418
01:40:31.130 --> 01:40:33.060
<v Speaker 4>Some people think I've already complete</v>

2419
01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:38.840
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

2420
01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:47.553
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2421
01:40:47.950 --> 01:40:48.670
<v Speaker 4>well it's,</v>

2422
01:40:48.670 --> 01:40:50.680
<v Speaker 4>it's stressful I suppose in some ways.</v>

2423
01:40:50.681 --> 01:40:51.320
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2424
01:40:51.320 --> 01:40:52.060
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2425
01:40:52.060 --> 01:40:52.720
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

2426
01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:53.350
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

2427
01:40:53.350 --> 01:40:53.950
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

2428
01:40:53.950 --> 01:40:57.550
<v Speaker 4>these talks particularly stressful because they're so positive.</v>

2429
01:40:58.270 --> 01:40:58.990
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2430
01:40:58.990 --> 01:41:03.990
<v Speaker 4>I like to come up and talk about the things that I've learned and to seal from</v>

2431
01:41:04.970 --> 01:41:09.940
<v Speaker 4>New People here and have a serious discussion about things that would help</v>

2432
01:41:09.941 --> 01:41:14.050
<v Speaker 4>orient us in the world and to push what I know farther it happened.</v>

2433
01:41:14.230 --> 01:41:16.360
<v Speaker 4>So that's,</v>

2434
01:41:17.470 --> 01:41:20.830
<v Speaker 4>it's so positive that I don't really think about this.</v>

2435
01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:25.080
<v Speaker 4>Certainly this part of it as stressful facing journalists to stressful,</v>

2436
01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:30.910
<v Speaker 4>not always usually and often.</v>

2437
01:41:31.390 --> 01:41:32.223
<v Speaker 4>And so</v>

2438
01:41:33.970 --> 01:41:35.530
<v Speaker 4>I dunno how I'm the wine from that.</v>

2439
01:41:35.531 --> 01:41:39.080
<v Speaker 4>I usually go sleep afterwards I guess is what I do that help me.</v>

2440
01:41:39.081 --> 01:41:39.914
<v Speaker 4>That was helpful.</v>

2441
01:41:40.330 --> 01:41:41.163
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2442
01:41:41.260 --> 01:41:42.350
<v Speaker 4>what I get for to</v>

2443
01:41:44.890 --> 01:41:49.210
<v Speaker 4>increase my ability to tolerate the activities that I'm engaged in.</v>

2444
01:41:49.211 --> 01:41:49.660
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>

2445
01:41:49.660 --> 01:41:54.280
<v Speaker 4>I travel with my wife and she's extremely helpful cause she's very level headed.</v>

2446
01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:55.540
<v Speaker 4>I have an extra brain along,</v>

2447
01:41:55.541 --> 01:41:56.890
<v Speaker 4>which is a useful thing.</v>

2448
01:41:57.250 --> 01:41:58.210
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

2449
01:41:58.390 --> 01:42:00.940
<v Speaker 4>we swear sometimes with work workout with them,</v>

2450
01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:04.390
<v Speaker 4>sometimes we go for a drive where we can do that and we go for a walk and I</v>

2451
01:42:04.391 --> 01:42:07.270
<v Speaker 4>spend time with my family and um,</v>

2452
01:42:07.570 --> 01:42:09.640
<v Speaker 4>those are all good things.</v>

2453
01:42:09.930 --> 01:42:10.330
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2454
01:42:10.330 --> 01:42:11.163
<v Speaker 4>but I go,</v>

2455
01:42:12.340 --> 01:42:13.540
<v Speaker 4>life is stressful.</v>

2456
01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:14.741
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2457
01:42:14.741 --> 01:42:19.420
<v Speaker 4>and at least I'm in a position where whatever I'm doing,</v>

2458
01:42:19.421 --> 01:42:23.890
<v Speaker 4>it's stressful is counterbalanced by exactly what that talks from all of you</v>

2459
01:42:23.891 --> 01:42:26.860
<v Speaker 4>tonight about it's deep what I'm doing,</v>

2460
01:42:26.890 --> 01:42:29.110
<v Speaker 4>what I'm engaged in is deeply meaningful.</v>

2461
01:42:30.730 --> 01:42:35.730
<v Speaker 4>And so it's a pleasure to be able to share that with other people and to see</v>

2462
01:42:35.981 --> 01:42:38.020
<v Speaker 4>that sense of meaningful engagement,</v>

2463
01:42:38.260 --> 01:42:40.510
<v Speaker 4>develop more people.</v>

2464
01:42:41.470 --> 01:42:42.303
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

2465
01:42:43.720 --> 01:42:45.910
<v Speaker 4>I can't think of anything better to do than that,</v>

2466
01:42:45.940 --> 01:42:48.840
<v Speaker 4>which is why I'm doing what I'm doing tonight.</v>

2467
01:42:48.860 --> 01:42:49.693
<v Speaker 4>For example,</v>

2468
01:42:49.900 --> 01:42:54.430
<v Speaker 4>I can't think of anything better than sitting here and talking to all of you</v>

2469
01:42:54.431 --> 01:42:59.431
<v Speaker 4>about these things that are necessary to understand and to lay out in the world.</v>

2470
01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:01.113
<v Speaker 4>And so</v>

2471
01:43:02.530 --> 01:43:04.810
<v Speaker 4>what do I do to unwind?</v>

2472
01:43:06.220 --> 01:43:10.030
<v Speaker 4>I think I do what you shouldn't do if you want to unwind.</v>

2473
01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:10.890
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2474
01:43:10.890 --> 01:43:13.120
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying my best to make things better</v>

2475
01:43:15.340 --> 01:43:18.310
<v Speaker 4>because it seems to me that would be better if they were better.</v>

2476
01:43:19.210 --> 01:43:20.043
<v Speaker 4>Simple.</v>

2477
01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:25.420
<v Speaker 4>And I have some sense of how bad things can be because I've studied how bad</v>

2478
01:43:25.421 --> 01:43:26.310
<v Speaker 4>things can be.</v>

2479
01:43:26.330 --> 01:43:29.140
<v Speaker 4>And I experienced some of it in my own personal life,</v>

2480
01:43:29.530 --> 01:43:33.850
<v Speaker 4>some of them with my clients because I've been in very dark places with my</v>

2481
01:43:33.851 --> 01:43:38.851
<v Speaker 4>clients and in my own life from time to time and certainly in my studies.</v>

2482
01:43:39.820 --> 01:43:42.070
<v Speaker 4>And I would grab him that everything.</v>

2483
01:43:42.071 --> 01:43:44.940
<v Speaker 4>Did you go to hell in a hand basket like it?</v>

2484
01:43:45.500 --> 01:43:50.500
<v Speaker 4>And I would like it if everyone got on the board and we all decided to make</v>

2485
01:43:51.351 --> 01:43:52.370
<v Speaker 4>things better.</v>

2486
01:43:52.430 --> 01:43:57.430
<v Speaker 4>Each of us started with our own lives and facilitating that is</v>

2487
01:43:59.900 --> 01:44:02.240
<v Speaker 4>that afternoon to the catastrophe of life.</v>

2488
01:44:02.660 --> 01:44:06.800
<v Speaker 4>And so that's a continual unwinding in a sense.</v>

2489
01:44:07.650 --> 01:44:08.140
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2490
01:44:08.140 --> 01:44:13.140
<v Speaker 4>and it's a privilege to be able to take part in m to also see this amazing</v>

2491
01:44:14.001 --> 01:44:14.834
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

2492
01:44:15.350 --> 01:44:18.110
<v Speaker 4>If I'd been developing for a long time now,</v>

2493
01:44:18.130 --> 01:44:18.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2494
01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:20.690
<v Speaker 4>I started doing these lectures,</v>

2495
01:44:21.740 --> 01:44:24.740
<v Speaker 4>public lectures were getting last year I did a series on the Bible,</v>

2496
01:44:25.100 --> 01:44:26.930
<v Speaker 4>which I thought was really quite comical that,</v>

2497
01:44:26.931 --> 01:44:29.140
<v Speaker 4>that word because um,</v>

2498
01:44:29.180 --> 01:44:33.080
<v Speaker 4>well think about it is I decided to do a series of lectures.</v>

2499
01:44:33.081 --> 01:44:37.400
<v Speaker 4>So I rented the theater and I decided that I wanted to do lectures on,</v>

2500
01:44:38.270 --> 01:44:40.630
<v Speaker 4>on gems inspections of what responsibilities,</v>

2501
01:44:40.631 --> 01:44:41.750
<v Speaker 4>starting with genesis,</v>

2502
01:44:42.290 --> 01:44:46.610
<v Speaker 4>and then I would do that publicly and then a whole bunch of people came.</v>

2503
01:44:47.350 --> 01:44:47.690
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2504
01:44:47.690 --> 01:44:48.760
<v Speaker 4>So that was pretty weird.</v>

2505
01:44:48.780 --> 01:44:51.930
<v Speaker 4>A lot of them are young men for exactly not the people who would ever tell them</v>

2506
01:44:51.931 --> 01:44:52.764
<v Speaker 4>to do that.</v>

2507
01:44:53.310 --> 01:44:56.990
<v Speaker 4>So they have lots of people have about 2 million,</v>

2508
01:44:57.050 --> 01:44:59.540
<v Speaker 4>two and a half a million people have watched the first of those lectures.</v>

2509
01:44:59.900 --> 01:45:02.150
<v Speaker 4>It's on the first sentence of Genesis.</v>

2510
01:45:02.420 --> 01:45:03.170
<v Speaker 4>So to Mt.</v>

2511
01:45:03.170 --> 01:45:05.630
<v Speaker 4>Two and a half million people have watched the three hour lecture.</v>

2512
01:45:05.750 --> 01:45:08.390
<v Speaker 4>It's three hours long on one sentence</v>

2513
01:45:10.670 --> 01:45:12.200
<v Speaker 4>from the first story in the Bible.</v>

2514
01:45:12.201 --> 01:45:13.400
<v Speaker 4>It's completely ridiculous.</v>

2515
01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:17.990
<v Speaker 4>When my book launched,</v>

2516
01:45:19.100 --> 01:45:21.270
<v Speaker 4>the publicists in,</v>

2517
01:45:21.410 --> 01:45:22.730
<v Speaker 4>in London rented.</v>

2518
01:45:22.731 --> 01:45:26.210
<v Speaker 4>It's either so that I can talk about it sold out right away.</v>

2519
01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:30.110
<v Speaker 4>So then they rented number one for the next day and it's sold out right away.</v>

2520
01:45:30.111 --> 01:45:32.660
<v Speaker 4>And so they rented one the next week and it's sold out too.</v>

2521
01:45:32.990 --> 01:45:34.960
<v Speaker 4>And then the same thing happened in Amsterdam.</v>

2522
01:45:35.630 --> 01:45:36.860
<v Speaker 4>And then I thought,</v>

2523
01:45:37.430 --> 01:45:38.390
<v Speaker 4>well that's interesting.</v>

2524
01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:39.471
<v Speaker 4>So dope,</v>

2525
01:45:39.471 --> 01:45:40.600
<v Speaker 4>15 theaters,</v>

2526
01:45:40.910 --> 01:45:45.910
<v Speaker 4>15 theatrical performances in Toronto would then for Europe,</v>

2527
01:45:46.461 --> 01:45:49.520
<v Speaker 4>I can probably go whatever and in the world and can here and we'll talk about</v>

2528
01:45:49.521 --> 01:45:50.331
<v Speaker 4>what I want to talk about,</v>

2529
01:45:50.331 --> 01:45:51.470
<v Speaker 4>how much people will come.</v>

2530
01:45:51.980 --> 01:45:52.611
<v Speaker 4>So I thought,</v>

2531
01:45:52.611 --> 01:45:52.711
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2532
01:45:52.711 --> 01:45:57.711
<v Speaker 4>I wash and dry that that Caesar [inaudible],</v>

2533
01:45:59.660 --> 01:46:02.690
<v Speaker 4>my wife and I have been in,</v>

2534
01:46:02.750 --> 01:46:07.040
<v Speaker 4>I think this is the 58 city in four months and so,</v>

2535
01:46:07.130 --> 01:46:07.680
<v Speaker 4>and the here,</v>

2536
01:46:07.680 --> 01:46:08.660
<v Speaker 4>here you all are.</v>

2537
01:46:08.661 --> 01:46:13.661
<v Speaker 4>And we're having a very serious conversation ourselves properly in the world.</v>

2538
01:46:14.310 --> 01:46:16.610
<v Speaker 4>And so that's not stressful,</v>

2539
01:46:16.611 --> 01:46:16.850
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2540
01:46:16.850 --> 01:46:18.170
<v Speaker 4>That's great.</v>

2541
01:46:19.100 --> 01:46:24.100
<v Speaker 4>So it compared to there's so much worth catastrophe in the world to be involved</v>

2542
01:46:29.361 --> 01:46:34.220
<v Speaker 4>in a continual conversation with thousands of people about how each of our</v>

2543
01:46:34.221 --> 01:46:38.960
<v Speaker 4>individual lives might be better and how that could spread into our families,</v>

2544
01:46:39.080 --> 01:46:41.060
<v Speaker 4>into the broader community.</v>

2545
01:46:41.150 --> 01:46:42.410
<v Speaker 4>It's like that's not stressful.</v>

2546
01:46:42.411 --> 01:46:44.030
<v Speaker 4>That's the opposite of stressful.</v>

2547
01:46:44.630 --> 01:46:45.710
<v Speaker 4>It's great.</v>

2548
01:46:45.730 --> 01:46:46.521
<v Speaker 4>It's wonderful.</v>

2549
01:46:46.521 --> 01:46:47.450
<v Speaker 4>It's so far as that.</v>

2550
01:46:47.451 --> 01:46:48.830
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe it you,</v>

2551
01:46:49.710 --> 01:46:52.320
<v Speaker 4>I was talking to my son the other day,</v>

2552
01:46:52.710 --> 01:46:53.281
<v Speaker 4>this morning,</v>

2553
01:46:53.281 --> 01:46:58.281
<v Speaker 4>I think it was this morning [inaudible] paid with Tammy and I,</v>

2554
01:47:04.020 --> 01:47:09.020
<v Speaker 4>we have a hell of a trip from big order from Dublin to London Dublin.</v>

2555
01:47:10.020 --> 01:47:15.020
<v Speaker 4>I talked to Sam Harris and govern the summary and 8,500 people showed that port</v>

2556
01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:16.350
<v Speaker 4>and this big stadium.</v>

2557
01:47:16.351 --> 01:47:18.540
<v Speaker 4>It was like the biggest philosophical discussion.</v>

2558
01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:21.270
<v Speaker 4>I think it was the biggest public philosophical discussion.</v>

2559
01:47:21.350 --> 01:47:22.570
<v Speaker 4>Not Common.</v>

2560
01:47:22.571 --> 01:47:27.571
<v Speaker 4>It's not like [inaudible] was that will be the biggest event and was like all</v>

2561
01:47:31.081 --> 01:47:36.081
<v Speaker 4>these people showed up cavernous Rena to him to hear a very difficult discussion</v>

2562
01:47:38.431 --> 01:47:41.910
<v Speaker 4>about the relationship between facts and values and religion and science.</v>

2563
01:47:42.050 --> 01:47:43.690
<v Speaker 4>They were like right into,</v>

2564
01:47:43.870 --> 01:47:44.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2565
01:47:44.430 --> 01:47:47.820
<v Speaker 4>we were going to switch to Q and a after an hour of discussion,</v>

2566
01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:52.880
<v Speaker 4>but the audience voted overwhelmingly with my clapping too to continue the</v>

2567
01:47:54.361 --> 01:47:55.051
<v Speaker 4>conversation.</v>

2568
01:47:55.051 --> 01:47:56.550
<v Speaker 4>So we talked for two and a half hours,</v>

2569
01:47:56.551 --> 01:47:58.120
<v Speaker 4>never cruise like right on the board.</v>

2570
01:47:58.121 --> 01:48:01.890
<v Speaker 4>And so it just turns out that people are lot smarter than we thought.</v>

2571
01:48:02.050 --> 01:48:02.940
<v Speaker 4>There's a huge,</v>

2572
01:48:03.420 --> 01:48:04.253
<v Speaker 4>huge,</v>

2573
01:48:04.470 --> 01:48:05.880
<v Speaker 4>well I think TV,</v>

2574
01:48:05.881 --> 01:48:09.960
<v Speaker 4>the narrow bandwidth of TV maybe made we were stupid and we're actually not.</v>

2575
01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:13.940
<v Speaker 4>And so there's this massive public hungered for detail and,</v>

2576
01:48:14.070 --> 01:48:14.903
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2577
01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:19.710
<v Speaker 4>and reasonably deep philosophical discussions like well that's a helpful thing.</v>

2578
01:48:20.190 --> 01:48:21.700
<v Speaker 4>So that was just beyond belief.</v>

2579
01:48:21.701 --> 01:48:26.701
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible]</v>

2580
01:48:30.700 --> 01:48:32.100
<v Speaker 4>we did that and I was crazy,</v>

2581
01:48:32.101 --> 01:48:32.934
<v Speaker 4>exciting,</v>

2582
01:48:32.940 --> 01:48:36.940
<v Speaker 4>ridiculously adventurous and the talk went really well and we'll take it</v>

2583
01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:37.500
<v Speaker 4>hopefully,</v>

2584
01:48:37.500 --> 01:48:37.981
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>

2585
01:48:37.981 --> 01:48:39.000
<v Speaker 4>that we'll be able to in August.</v>

2586
01:48:39.001 --> 01:48:43.080
<v Speaker 4>And then people can see when there was a discussion about the relative merits of</v>

2587
01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:45.330
<v Speaker 4>an atheist materialist viewpoint,</v>

2588
01:48:46.090 --> 01:48:48.150
<v Speaker 4>that's cultural or religious traditions,</v>

2589
01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:50.410
<v Speaker 4>religious viewpoint.</v>

2590
01:48:50.910 --> 01:48:55.200
<v Speaker 4>And we had a good discussion on both sides of that argument.</v>

2591
01:48:55.201 --> 01:48:55.820
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

2592
01:48:55.820 --> 01:48:56.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2593
01:48:56.070 --> 01:48:56.700
<v Speaker 4>with any luck,</v>

2594
01:48:56.700 --> 01:48:59.400
<v Speaker 4>a couple of million people will watch those videos and they can have a</v>

2595
01:48:59.401 --> 01:49:01.950
<v Speaker 4>discussion about it and maybe the concern themselves up property.</v>

2596
01:49:01.951 --> 01:49:05.580
<v Speaker 4>And then we went to London and did the same thing again.</v>

2597
01:49:05.740 --> 01:49:07.940
<v Speaker 4>And along with a variety of,</v>

2598
01:49:08.340 --> 01:49:09.000
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

2599
01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:10.510
<v Speaker 4>of other activities.</v>

2600
01:49:11.010 --> 01:49:11.451
<v Speaker 4>Like I said,</v>

2601
01:49:11.451 --> 01:49:15.870
<v Speaker 4>I was talking to my son about it this morning and he's a pretty tough kid and</v>

2602
01:49:15.900 --> 01:49:17.100
<v Speaker 4>pretty level headed.</v>

2603
01:49:17.310 --> 01:49:18.510
<v Speaker 4>And when he was talking about it,</v>

2604
01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:19.460
<v Speaker 4>it made him,</v>

2605
01:49:19.460 --> 01:49:21.270
<v Speaker 4>he broke down at the of crime.</v>

2606
01:49:21.450 --> 01:49:22.620
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

2607
01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:26.010
<v Speaker 4>and the reason for that is because it's absolutely overwhelming to watch this</v>

2608
01:49:26.011 --> 01:49:26.401
<v Speaker 4>happen.</v>

2609
01:49:26.401 --> 01:49:27.750
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe.</v>

2610
01:49:28.290 --> 01:49:29.400
<v Speaker 4>So it's not stressful.</v>

2611
01:49:29.401 --> 01:49:29.781
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2612
01:49:29.781 --> 01:49:30.614
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2613
01:49:30.750 --> 01:49:33.470
<v Speaker 4>it's a privilege to be doing next.</v>

2614
01:49:33.471 --> 01:49:36.140
<v Speaker 4>It's an ounce of bloody privileged to be doing this and that.</v>

2615
01:49:36.141 --> 01:49:41.141
<v Speaker 4>So [inaudible]</v>

2616
01:49:50.490 --> 01:49:55.490
<v Speaker 4>how do you move forward advice after having made every granted huge mistake.</v>

2617
01:50:07.720 --> 01:50:08.201
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2618
01:50:08.201 --> 01:50:10.010
<v Speaker 4>this is one of the reasons that I,</v>

2619
01:50:10.170 --> 01:50:13.950
<v Speaker 4>and I take the biblical elections I did last year were so helpful to me.</v>

2620
01:50:14.220 --> 01:50:15.380
<v Speaker 4>And I think that the people,</v>

2621
01:50:16.030 --> 01:50:18.910
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that's quite interesting about those stories,</v>

2622
01:50:19.240 --> 01:50:22.810
<v Speaker 4>Abrahamic stories in particular is it was bloody people.</v>

2623
01:50:23.250 --> 01:50:24.880
<v Speaker 4>They just make mistakes all the time.</v>

2624
01:50:26.790 --> 01:50:27.790
<v Speaker 4>So Abraham,</v>

2625
01:50:27.791 --> 01:50:28.780
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

2626
01:50:29.060 --> 01:50:29.230
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2627
01:50:29.230 --> 01:50:30.380
<v Speaker 4>he was chosen by God.</v>

2628
01:50:31.530 --> 01:50:33.250
<v Speaker 4>I pathetically like all the people</v>

2629
01:50:34.760 --> 01:50:35.590
<v Speaker 4>were,</v>

2630
01:50:35.590 --> 01:50:35.891
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2631
01:50:35.891 --> 01:50:39.360
<v Speaker 4>he just takes one absolutely catastrophic mistake after another.</v>

2632
01:50:39.950 --> 01:50:44.950
<v Speaker 4>And so that's life man making in regretting huge mistakes.</v>

2633
01:50:46.690 --> 01:50:49.480
<v Speaker 4>Now that doesn't mean that you should just go and propagating the mistakes,</v>

2634
01:50:50.350 --> 01:50:52.790
<v Speaker 4>so you have to take responsibility for it.</v>

2635
01:50:52.810 --> 01:50:57.810
<v Speaker 4>But the people that I've watched in my life lived property that say they learned</v>

2636
01:50:59.831 --> 01:51:00.581
<v Speaker 4>from their mistakes,</v>

2637
01:51:00.581 --> 01:51:04.180
<v Speaker 4>but they didn't beat themselves to death because of the,</v>

2638
01:51:04.780 --> 01:51:04.991
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2639
01:51:04.991 --> 01:51:05.471
<v Speaker 4>when you think,</v>

2640
01:51:05.471 --> 01:51:06.304
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2641
01:51:07.570 --> 01:51:08.281
<v Speaker 4>so this is,</v>

2642
01:51:08.281 --> 01:51:09.770
<v Speaker 4>well this was a regretted it to Dell.</v>

2643
01:51:09.771 --> 01:51:10.211
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>

2644
01:51:10.211 --> 01:51:13.510
<v Speaker 4>well we don't take adulthood is out in the public square and stone.</v>

2645
01:51:15.160 --> 01:51:18.190
<v Speaker 4>And so you probably shouldn't do that to yourself.</v>

2646
01:51:19.560 --> 01:51:20.260
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2647
01:51:20.260 --> 01:51:21.200
<v Speaker 4>if you regret it,</v>

2648
01:51:21.220 --> 01:51:21.761
<v Speaker 4>well then what?</v>

2649
01:51:21.761 --> 01:51:24.580
<v Speaker 4>You have to do least you have to repent and you have to atone.</v>

2650
01:51:25.010 --> 01:51:25.843
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2651
01:51:26.010 --> 01:51:28.420
<v Speaker 4>And so what is [inaudible]?</v>

2652
01:51:28.470 --> 01:51:28.801
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2653
01:51:28.801 --> 01:51:33.801
<v Speaker 4>it means you have to go over what you did and you have to figure out now that</v>

2654
01:51:34.021 --> 01:51:35.020
<v Speaker 4>you know it was a mistake,</v>

2655
01:51:35.030 --> 01:51:37.940
<v Speaker 4>you have to figure out why you were Sadam clueless since of damage,</v>

2656
01:51:37.941 --> 01:51:40.830
<v Speaker 4>stupid and exactly what we did wrong.</v>

2657
01:51:40.831 --> 01:51:42.450
<v Speaker 4>Like with each decision point,</v>

2658
01:51:42.510 --> 01:51:47.100
<v Speaker 4>like you know when you first met the person that you have the affair with,</v>

2659
01:51:47.490 --> 01:51:51.590
<v Speaker 4>you probably flirted with him a little bit more than that.</v>

2660
01:51:51.750 --> 01:51:52.583
<v Speaker 4>Then you,</v>

2661
01:51:53.600 --> 01:51:58.100
<v Speaker 4>you probably flirted with him to a degree that you regarded as Miskiw epic</v>

2662
01:51:58.120 --> 01:51:58.953
<v Speaker 4>access.</v>

2663
01:51:59.850 --> 01:52:01.490
<v Speaker 4>Did Eddie ones snow?</v>

2664
01:52:01.491 --> 01:52:02.241
<v Speaker 4>You have to figure out,</v>

2665
01:52:02.241 --> 01:52:05.540
<v Speaker 4>well why in the world did I think that was a good idea?</v>

2666
01:52:05.541 --> 01:52:07.340
<v Speaker 4>Then you have to know he'd sack.</v>

2667
01:52:07.370 --> 01:52:08.570
<v Speaker 4>So if you're a,</v>

2668
01:52:09.080 --> 01:52:14.080
<v Speaker 4>if you're walking down a path and you'd get lost in wonder us without that,</v>

2669
01:52:14.151 --> 01:52:15.110
<v Speaker 4>you get lost.</v>

2670
01:52:15.380 --> 01:52:18.530
<v Speaker 4>You have to figure out how it is that you wandered off the path.</v>

2671
01:52:19.040 --> 01:52:22.960
<v Speaker 4>Because the purpose of of Rick head take let's say,</v>

2672
01:52:23.010 --> 01:52:25.190
<v Speaker 4>so that when you're back on the path,</v>

2673
01:52:25.250 --> 01:52:25.701
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

2674
01:52:25.701 --> 01:52:26.780
<v Speaker 4>you can find your way back.</v>

2675
01:52:26.781 --> 01:52:27.920
<v Speaker 4>That would be the first purpose.</v>

2676
01:52:27.950 --> 01:52:30.620
<v Speaker 4>The second is so you don't wonder off again.</v>

2677
01:52:31.190 --> 01:52:33.250
<v Speaker 4>And if you wondered off once that your pro,</v>

2678
01:52:33.270 --> 01:52:37.440
<v Speaker 4>the wandering off in that matter in so then you have to figure out why you who</v>

2679
01:52:37.520 --> 01:52:42.260
<v Speaker 4>wandering off in that manner right down into the most painful level of detail.</v>

2680
01:52:42.410 --> 01:52:44.840
<v Speaker 4>And then you have to figure out how not to do it again.</v>

2681
01:52:44.930 --> 01:52:48.320
<v Speaker 4>And as soon as you figure out how not to do it again,</v>

2682
01:52:49.400 --> 01:52:51.800
<v Speaker 4>then you should start beating yourself up.</v>

2683
01:52:52.420 --> 01:52:52.820
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2684
01:52:52.820 --> 01:52:54.590
<v Speaker 4>because you've learned your lesson.</v>

2685
01:52:55.880 --> 01:52:57.340
<v Speaker 4>That's sort of the principle.</v>

2686
01:52:57.460 --> 01:53:02.180
<v Speaker 4>I try it out once the principles of discipline for children in chapter five what</v>

2687
01:53:02.181 --> 01:53:03.170
<v Speaker 4>is the district's goals?</v>

2688
01:53:03.171 --> 01:53:08.171
<v Speaker 4>Is you still more forced than this necessary minimum necessary for us,</v>

2689
01:53:09.021 --> 01:53:09.854
<v Speaker 4>it's a great,</v>

2690
01:53:10.100 --> 01:53:10.933
<v Speaker 4>it's a great,</v>

2691
01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:14.750
<v Speaker 4>and you said on your cell phone you make mistakes.</v>

2692
01:53:15.230 --> 01:53:15.561
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>

2693
01:53:15.561 --> 01:53:20.561
<v Speaker 4>Maybe so you have to finger second when you get wrong criteria.</v>

2694
01:53:21.981 --> 01:53:22.870
<v Speaker 4>When can you send him,</v>

2695
01:53:22.871 --> 01:53:23.661
<v Speaker 4>did something wrong.</v>

2696
01:53:23.661 --> 01:53:26.310
<v Speaker 4>You said you regretted it okay and get something wrong.</v>

2697
01:53:26.430 --> 01:53:30.330
<v Speaker 4>Whereas you with regret or less pick your just regretting the fact that part of</v>

2698
01:53:30.500 --> 01:53:32.130
<v Speaker 4>your life and you actually,</v>

2699
01:53:32.131 --> 01:53:33.590
<v Speaker 4>you know what nuts that's feeling,</v>

2700
01:53:33.591 --> 01:53:34.610
<v Speaker 4>sorry for yourself,</v>

2701
01:53:34.640 --> 01:53:35.610
<v Speaker 4>that's going to regret it.</v>

2702
01:53:35.640 --> 01:53:38.450
<v Speaker 4>It's going to happen to sort those things out because you don't get to feel</v>

2703
01:53:38.451 --> 01:53:39.410
<v Speaker 4>sorry for yourself.</v>

2704
01:53:39.830 --> 01:53:41.380
<v Speaker 4>You just to give to regret.</v>

2705
01:53:41.810 --> 01:53:42.441
<v Speaker 4>And if you read,</v>

2706
01:53:42.441 --> 01:53:42.601
<v Speaker 4>read,</v>

2707
01:53:42.601 --> 01:53:46.280
<v Speaker 4>read it into get something wrong and then you got to figure out what you did</v>

2708
01:53:46.281 --> 01:53:46.880
<v Speaker 4>wrong.</v>

2709
01:53:46.880 --> 01:53:50.840
<v Speaker 4>Exactly right down to the detailed levels and what was wrong with your</v>

2710
01:53:50.841 --> 01:53:53.360
<v Speaker 4>perception and your beliefs that led you in that direction.</v>

2711
01:53:53.520 --> 01:53:57.750
<v Speaker 4>Everyone would have to do to put that right and then you have right.</v>

2712
01:53:58.460 --> 01:53:59.820
<v Speaker 4>And then maybe you have to call rob,</v>

2713
01:53:59.850 --> 01:54:04.430
<v Speaker 4>make it manage all the people that you heard and then you have to be back.</v>

2714
01:54:04.520 --> 01:54:07.000
<v Speaker 4>And then perhaps you'll find yourself back on the path.</v>

2715
01:54:07.200 --> 01:54:10.640
<v Speaker 4>And then you have to stay on the path as best as you can.</v>

2716
01:54:11.830 --> 01:54:12.663
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2717
01:54:12.910 --> 01:54:17.910
<v Speaker 4>and that's Kate in some sense because if we all had to pay the ultimate price</v>

2718
01:54:18.830 --> 01:54:19.570
<v Speaker 4>for our sins,</v>

2719
01:54:19.570 --> 01:54:21.740
<v Speaker 4>if every single one of us would be</v>

2720
01:54:25.840 --> 01:54:30.840
<v Speaker 4>just as part why the concept of original sin still useful and everyone feels it</v>

2721
01:54:30.921 --> 01:54:31.910
<v Speaker 4>because everyone's guilty.</v>

2722
01:54:32.540 --> 01:54:33.373
<v Speaker 4>Never once ashamed.</v>

2723
01:54:34.670 --> 01:54:39.140
<v Speaker 4>So we have this inbuilt sense of something going wrong.</v>

2724
01:54:39.230 --> 01:54:40.370
<v Speaker 4>And if we can name it,</v>

2725
01:54:40.470 --> 01:54:41.870
<v Speaker 4>it just hot sense.</v>

2726
01:54:41.960 --> 01:54:44.480
<v Speaker 4>And that's why the idea of original sin isn't so useful.</v>

2727
01:54:44.481 --> 01:54:47.790
<v Speaker 4>Even though it has perhaps some conceptual problems associated with it.</v>

2728
01:54:48.530 --> 01:54:49.400
<v Speaker 4>Perhaps it's normal.</v>

2729
01:54:50.710 --> 01:54:51.543
<v Speaker 4>But</v>

2730
01:54:52.790 --> 01:54:56.280
<v Speaker 4>in this particular situation you don't,</v>

2731
01:54:56.900 --> 01:54:59.330
<v Speaker 4>you're a bad person.</v>

2732
01:55:00.230 --> 01:55:01.670
<v Speaker 4>But so is everyone else.</v>

2733
01:55:02.220 --> 01:55:03.380
<v Speaker 4>So it doesn't mark,</v>

2734
01:55:03.381 --> 01:55:03.561
<v Speaker 4>do you?</v>

2735
01:55:03.561 --> 01:55:05.390
<v Speaker 4>Well as particular horrible.</v>

2736
01:55:06.310 --> 01:55:07.220
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't mean the horrible.</v>

2737
01:55:07.230 --> 01:55:08.120
<v Speaker 4>This isn't real.</v>

2738
01:55:08.830 --> 01:55:10.010
<v Speaker 4>But it's not just you.</v>

2739
01:55:11.570 --> 01:55:12.850
<v Speaker 4>And then what you do about it.</v>

2740
01:55:12.851 --> 01:55:13.040
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>

2741
01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:14.120
<v Speaker 4>you're trying to be better.</v>

2742
01:55:14.660 --> 01:55:17.630
<v Speaker 4>And that's what we do about what's wrong with you to begin with.</v>

2743
01:55:17.930 --> 01:55:18.670
<v Speaker 4>Every,</v>

2744
01:55:18.670 --> 01:55:19.700
<v Speaker 4>every one of us,</v>

2745
01:55:20.960 --> 01:55:22.160
<v Speaker 4>we've all got things to learn,</v>

2746
01:55:22.161 --> 01:55:22.481
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2747
01:55:22.481 --> 01:55:23.300
<v Speaker 4>And plenty of them.</v>

2748
01:55:23.300 --> 01:55:24.450
<v Speaker 4>The world is what it couldn't be.</v>

2749
01:55:24.710 --> 01:55:25.730
<v Speaker 4>That's our fault.</v>

2750
01:55:26.480 --> 01:55:27.800
<v Speaker 4>And so we've got lots to learn it.</v>

2751
01:55:27.801 --> 01:55:28.281
<v Speaker 4>So to you,</v>

2752
01:55:28.281 --> 01:55:29.450
<v Speaker 4>and you try and learn it.</v>

2753
01:55:30.440 --> 01:55:35.440
<v Speaker 4>You treat yourself with firm enough that you learned and not harsh enough having</v>

2754
01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:38.450
<v Speaker 4>something you've died on your burn</v>

2755
01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:47.000
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

2756
01:55:52.860 --> 01:55:57.860
