1
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm still going to chase you back to that story about both the PR company,</v>

2
00:00:11.721 --> 00:00:13.190
<v Speaker 1>but I have another question for you.</v>

3
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:14.623
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

4
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:15.081
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5
00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:15.650
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

6
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.650
<v Speaker 1>you are detailing out the kind of childhood that in principle could have left</v>

7
00:00:20.841 --> 00:00:22.310
<v Speaker 1>you bitter and resentful.</v>

8
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.070
<v Speaker 1>So why didn't it,</v>

9
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.490
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

10
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:25.600
<v Speaker 1>why didn't that happen to you?</v>

11
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:26.111
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

12
00:00:26.111 --> 00:00:27.520
<v Speaker 1>I think because of my father,</v>

13
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.580
<v Speaker 1>my mother was a deep pessimists.</v>

14
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.750
<v Speaker 1>My father was a profound optimist and I must've had my father's genes</v>

15
00:00:36.241 --> 00:00:37.260
<v Speaker 1>predominating over.</v>

16
00:00:37.261 --> 00:00:38.094
<v Speaker 1>I got them both,</v>

17
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:39.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

18
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.550
<v Speaker 1>optimism and pessimism.</v>

19
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.870
<v Speaker 1>But I'm grateful for everything that's happened in my life.</v>

20
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm from every deprivation.</v>

21
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.961
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

22
00:00:45.961 --> 00:00:47.580
<v Speaker 1>I was sick in bed for 15 years,</v>

23
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.500
<v Speaker 1>and even that turned out to be,</v>

24
00:00:49.501 --> 00:00:50.490
<v Speaker 1>it was nightmarish.</v>

25
00:00:50.491 --> 00:00:51.330
<v Speaker 1>It was horrible.</v>

26
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.830
<v Speaker 1>It inflicted pains for which there are no words in the English language because</v>

27
00:00:55.831 --> 00:00:58.680
<v Speaker 1>I was isolated for five years and could not talk,</v>

28
00:00:58.681 --> 00:01:02.340
<v Speaker 1>literally could not muster the energy to move the larynx,</v>

29
00:01:02.341 --> 00:01:04.080
<v Speaker 1>to give a single syllable of sound.</v>

30
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.420
<v Speaker 1>MMM.</v>

31
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.960
<v Speaker 1>And yet,</v>

32
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.350
<v Speaker 1>I as nightmarish,</v>

33
00:01:08.351 --> 00:01:09.780
<v Speaker 1>horrible and monstrous does,</v>

34
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.760
<v Speaker 1>it was I,</v>

35
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.880
<v Speaker 1>I found it to international scientific groups.</v>

36
00:01:12.881 --> 00:01:13.714
<v Speaker 1>So at that time,</v>

37
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.640
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

38
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.660
<v Speaker 1>I wrote three books,</v>

39
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

40
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.130
<v Speaker 1>and I learned what it's like to be at that extreme of the human experience,</v>

41
00:01:20.131 --> 00:01:21.510
<v Speaker 1>extreme isolation,</v>

42
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.560
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

43
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.820
<v Speaker 1>extreme pain.</v>

44
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.913
<v Speaker 1>What happened to you?</v>

45
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.590
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

46
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.000
<v Speaker 1>what were you suffering from?</v>

47
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.841
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

48
00:01:27.841 --> 00:01:28.740
<v Speaker 1>we figured it out.</v>

49
00:01:28.741 --> 00:01:28.951
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

50
00:01:28.951 --> 00:01:31.710
<v Speaker 1>I figured it out on my own and then taught my doctor about it.</v>

51
00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:33.420
<v Speaker 1>It's called chronic fatigue syndrome.</v>

52
00:01:33.421 --> 00:01:38.010
<v Speaker 1>It's better sometimes known as Myalgic encephalomyelitis and nobody knows what</v>

53
00:01:38.011 --> 00:01:38.671
<v Speaker 1>causes it.</v>

54
00:01:38.671 --> 00:01:39.960
<v Speaker 1>But in 1988,</v>

55
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.630
<v Speaker 1>I really have been working on my book,</v>

56
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

57
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.560
<v Speaker 1>for a long enough to have fifth to first 15 chapters of my first book.</v>

58
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.960
<v Speaker 1>I really wanted to get out of publicity.</v>

59
00:01:50.961 --> 00:01:53.330
<v Speaker 1>There's no way I could've because I was a legend.</v>

60
00:01:53.331 --> 00:01:53.601
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

61
00:01:53.601 --> 00:01:58.220
<v Speaker 1>the billboard guy to music publicity had 20 pages of nothing but me.</v>

62
00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.593
<v Speaker 1>MMM.</v>

63
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.823
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

64
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:01.091
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

65
00:02:01.091 --> 00:02:05.110
<v Speaker 1>your wife is not going to let you out of a successful career.</v>

66
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.500
<v Speaker 1>And if she's,</v>

67
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.950
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't want to lose the money,</v>

68
00:02:07.951 --> 00:02:09.480
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't want to lose the status.</v>

69
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:10.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

70
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.860
<v Speaker 1>and all of a sudden wank.</v>

71
00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.770
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what was happening to me.</v>

72
00:02:13.771 --> 00:02:16.590
<v Speaker 1>It was 90 degrees out and I'd be freezing and shivering.</v>

73
00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:17.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

74
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.010
<v Speaker 1>it was 40 degrees out and I would be overheated.</v>

75
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.173
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

76
00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:22.031
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

77
00:02:22.031 --> 00:02:23.470
<v Speaker 1>I was losing strengths.</v>

78
00:02:23.471 --> 00:02:25.300
<v Speaker 1>I was losing the strength to pick up coach.</v>

79
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.050
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

80
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.883
<v Speaker 1>MMM.</v>

81
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.310
<v Speaker 1>And I had no idea of what was happening.</v>

82
00:02:29.311 --> 00:02:32.550
<v Speaker 1>And I went to doctors and the doctors had no idea of what was happening.</v>

83
00:02:32.551 --> 00:02:34.230
<v Speaker 1>And I walked into my office one day,</v>

84
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.280
<v Speaker 1>it was the biggest PR firm in the music industry and said to my staff,</v>

85
00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what's happening.</v>

86
00:02:40.481 --> 00:02:41.380
<v Speaker 1>I could be dying,</v>

87
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.660
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to be out of here in two weeks and I'm giving you the business.</v>

88
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.600
<v Speaker 1>And the next day,</v>

89
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.040
<v Speaker 1>a competitor from the west coast called and offered me a huge amount of money</v>

90
00:02:51.041 --> 00:02:51.874
<v Speaker 1>for the business.</v>

91
00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.871
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

92
00:02:52.871 --> 00:02:53.830
<v Speaker 1>I cannot sell it to you.</v>

93
00:02:53.831 --> 00:02:57.040
<v Speaker 1>I just gave it to my staff yesterday because my word is my bond.</v>

94
00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.150
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

95
00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

96
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.610
<v Speaker 1>I kept trying to,</v>

97
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.590
<v Speaker 1>struggling to try to do normal things.</v>

98
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.701
<v Speaker 1>Leon Uris.</v>

99
00:03:03.701 --> 00:03:06.430
<v Speaker 1>When I finished my manuscript of the first book,</v>

100
00:03:06.431 --> 00:03:09.880
<v Speaker 1>the Lucifer principle of scientific expedition into the forces of history,</v>

101
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.980
<v Speaker 1>I got a copy to Leon Uris,</v>

102
00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:16.981
<v Speaker 1>the novelist and Leon Uris read it and called on a Sunday night and raved about</v>

103
00:03:17.501 --> 00:03:18.490
<v Speaker 1>it for half an hour.</v>

104
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:19.540
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

105
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.580
<v Speaker 1>so I tried to get it to New York to see him,</v>

106
00:03:21.581 --> 00:03:22.414
<v Speaker 1>but I had a rent.</v>

107
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:23.693
<v Speaker 1>Are you ready for this?</v>

108
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.060
<v Speaker 1>Cause I couldn't afford this.</v>

109
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.330
<v Speaker 1>I had a rental Lilo so I could lay down in the back seat all the way into</v>

110
00:03:30.461 --> 00:03:35.461
<v Speaker 1>Manhattan to see Leon and then lay down in the back seat all the way home.</v>

111
00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.520
<v Speaker 1>That's not the world's most glamorous limousine story.</v>

112
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.000
<v Speaker 1>Now it's not at all the world's most glamorous limousines for any.</v>

113
00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:46.210
<v Speaker 1>Eventually I learned I couldn't even do that and eventually it became too weak</v>

114
00:03:46.211 --> 00:03:50.260
<v Speaker 1>to even try because I was just lucky to be able to get to my bathroom.</v>

115
00:03:50.261 --> 00:03:53.410
<v Speaker 1>But if I tried to get to my kitchen and extra 10 steps away,</v>

116
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.280
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

117
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.070
<v Speaker 1>my body wouldn't let me do it.</v>

118
00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.980
<v Speaker 1>And one of the lessons I learned in my childhood,</v>

119
00:03:59.981 --> 00:04:00.251
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

120
00:04:00.251 --> 00:04:01.600
<v Speaker 1>when I was 16 years old,</v>

121
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.180
<v Speaker 1>poetry was extremely important to me.</v>

122
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.520
<v Speaker 1>And I learned a lesson from two poets.</v>

123
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.820
<v Speaker 1>One was at the Saint Vincent Millay and her poem Renascence said to see the</v>

124
00:04:11.831 --> 00:04:13.570
<v Speaker 1>infinite and the tiniest of things,</v>

125
00:04:13.571 --> 00:04:15.940
<v Speaker 1>which was definitely a goal on my list.</v>

126
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.650
<v Speaker 1>You have to be able to comprehend the suffering of every human on the face of</v>

127
00:04:20.651 --> 00:04:23.380
<v Speaker 1>this planet under every extreme circumstance.</v>

128
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.880
<v Speaker 1>And I expanded that to mean you have to come to understand not just the</v>

129
00:04:27.881 --> 00:04:28.451
<v Speaker 1>suffering,</v>

130
00:04:28.451 --> 00:04:33.310
<v Speaker 1>but the point of view of everyone who comes from a culture that's so foreign</v>

131
00:04:33.311 --> 00:04:36.520
<v Speaker 1>tiers that it seems like was from another planet.</v>

132
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.780
<v Speaker 1>So this was what,</v>

133
00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.900
<v Speaker 1>what Edna Saint Vincent Millay was telling me was 15 years of absolute and</v>

134
00:04:44.801 --> 00:04:49.801
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable punishment is an advantage and it will serve you well for the rest</v>

135
00:04:49.901 --> 00:04:50.350
<v Speaker 1>of your life.</v>
