00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.000
<v Speaker 1>We are expecting our first eight,</v>

2
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:09.631
<v Speaker 1>Evan says,</v>

3
00:00:09.631 --> 00:00:12.570
<v Speaker 1>we are expecting our first child in May a daughter.</v>

4
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.250
<v Speaker 1>Any specific,</v>

5
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.590
<v Speaker 1>any advice specific to raising daughters?</v>

6
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.371
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

7
00:00:17.371 --> 00:00:18.600
<v Speaker 1>congratulations first,</v>

8
00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:19.620
<v Speaker 1>so that's great.</v>

9
00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:20.803
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

10
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:27.543
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

11
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:29.241
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

12
00:00:29.241 --> 00:00:31.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm just thinking about my daughter and specific advice.</v>

13
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.300
<v Speaker 1>I would say don't be afraid to support her masculine and feminine sides,</v>

14
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.321
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:46.080
<v Speaker 1>and so the feminine side is you'll find little girls.</v>

16
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.360
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

17
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.720
<v Speaker 1>not all little girls because some are more masculine than others,</v>

18
00:00:48.721 --> 00:00:50.640
<v Speaker 1>but let's say you have a more feminine little girl.</v>

19
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.550
<v Speaker 1>She's going to like to dress up and she's going to like to put on jewelry.</v>

20
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.450
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing how much of that stuff seems to be implicit or a Nate,</v>

21
00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.991
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:00:57.991 --> 00:00:59.400
<v Speaker 1>and that can be really supported.</v>

23
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.050
<v Speaker 1>But then by the same token,</v>

24
00:01:01.051 --> 00:01:04.620
<v Speaker 1>it's nice to wrestle with your little girl kids and little kids really like</v>

25
00:01:04.621 --> 00:01:06.900
<v Speaker 1>rough and tumble play into and to,</v>

26
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.771
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

27
00:01:07.771 --> 00:01:11.010
<v Speaker 1>encourage her to be courageous and forthright.</v>

28
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.420
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're lucky you can,</v>

29
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.570
<v Speaker 1>you can support her in both elements of her personality and that would be a</v>

30
00:01:15.571 --> 00:01:16.530
<v Speaker 1>really good thing to do.</v>

31
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:17.723
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

32
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.681
<v Speaker 1>don't let her wrap.</v>

33
00:01:20.681 --> 00:01:22.340
<v Speaker 1>Are you around her little finger either?</v>

34
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.520
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing too.</v>
