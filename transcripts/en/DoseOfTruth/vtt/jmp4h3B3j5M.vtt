1
00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.530
<v Speaker 1>There are a variety of very complex</v>
<v Speaker 1>things facing us,</v>

2
00:00:09.531 --> 00:00:12.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of them is while the Iq issue</v>

3
00:00:12.741 --> 00:00:16.700
<v Speaker 1>that we talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another is this polarization between</v>

4
00:00:16.701 --> 00:00:19.820
<v Speaker 1>left and right that seems to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>characterizing everywhere in the West.</v>

5
00:00:19.821 --> 00:00:21.230
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the same in Australia,</v>

6
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.880
<v Speaker 1>New Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all through Europe,</v>

7
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.680
<v Speaker 1>in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the US.</v>

8
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.430
<v Speaker 1>I think you guys are actually a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>more protected against the most places.</v>

9
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.730
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the other one is,</v>

10
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.440
<v Speaker 1>well we need to dialogue between Islam</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Christianity and Judaism for that</v>

11
00:00:36.441 --> 00:00:37.460
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean the big,</v>

12
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:42.490
<v Speaker 1>the big clash for the Western world is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is Islam versus Christianity.</v>

13
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.000
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't think about it in those</v>

14
00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:51.170
<v Speaker 1>terms because many intellectuals in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>west think of themselves as secular,</v>

15
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.920
<v Speaker 1>but it's a massive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a massive problem.</v>

16
00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:58.820
<v Speaker 1>And I'm hoping to conduct a whole series</v>
<v Speaker 1>of conversations with,</v>

17
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.040
<v Speaker 1>with Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.280
<v Speaker 1>former and present pro and anti to try</v>
<v Speaker 1>to facilitate a dialogue because there's</v>

19
00:01:07.431 --> 00:01:08.450
<v Speaker 1>lots to talk about.</v>

20
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've studied religious thinking a lot</v>

21
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.280
<v Speaker 1>and I'm pretty ignorant about Islam</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's a complicated system and</v>

22
00:01:16.281 --> 00:01:20.690
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult to get into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I can tell you that what I've read</v>

23
00:01:20.691 --> 00:01:25.691
<v Speaker 1>about Islam has not made me feel better</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the chances of reconciliation</v>

24
00:01:27.831 --> 00:01:29.750
<v Speaker 1>between the Christian and the Islamic</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

25
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.360
<v Speaker 1>So like I don't know what to make of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact,</v>

26
00:01:32.361 --> 00:01:33.710
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

27
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.970
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the figure of Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't care if you're religious or</v>

28
00:01:37.971 --> 00:01:40.160
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even care if Christ existed or</v>

29
00:01:40.161 --> 00:01:42.350
<v Speaker 1>dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I certainly don't care at the moment</v>

30
00:01:42.351 --> 00:01:46.430
<v Speaker 1>about claims to divinity or the lock</v>
<v Speaker 1>there up.</v>

31
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.080
<v Speaker 1>It's just speaking as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say I'm speaking as a secular</v>

32
00:01:49.081 --> 00:01:53.990
<v Speaker 1>intellectual as a figure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a figure of peace.</v>

33
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that that's disputable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

34
00:01:57.801 --> 00:02:00.080
<v Speaker 1>he certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't a warlord.</v>

35
00:02:00.081 --> 00:02:02.240
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one thing that's for certain,</v>

36
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.730
<v Speaker 1>he never led armies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

37
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.370
<v Speaker 1>Whereas that's not the case with</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] at all.</v>

38
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.400
<v Speaker 1>Mohammad was clearly and indisputably a</v>
<v Speaker 1>warlord and so it isn't the obvious to</v>

39
00:02:13.641 --> 00:02:18.641
<v Speaker 1>me what to make of that except that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>bloody complicated in a child bride as</v>

40
00:02:19.071 --> 00:02:20.080
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>

41
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that that one is somewhat less</v>

42
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.750
<v Speaker 1>problematic to me because I think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can write that off to the cultural</v>

43
00:02:30.261 --> 00:02:32.280
<v Speaker 1>morays of the time now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

44
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.860
<v Speaker 1>I know that there's a weakness in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think we have to address</v>

45
00:02:36.861 --> 00:02:38.450
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>

46
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.660
<v Speaker 1>when the founder of your religion spread</v>
<v Speaker 1>that religion by the sword,</v>

47
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.240
<v Speaker 1>it makes it rather difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when your religion has been</v>

48
00:02:47.241 --> 00:02:51.740
<v Speaker 1>embroiled in a vicious civil war from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the day of Mohammed's death,</v>

49
00:02:51.741 --> 00:02:53.710
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly the case in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Islam,</v>

50
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.580
<v Speaker 1>between the Sunni's and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Shiites,</v>

51
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.550
<v Speaker 1>that war started literally the day that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mohammed died.</v>

52
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.190
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult for me to see how</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can be reconciled with the claims</v>

53
00:03:03.191 --> 00:03:04.900
<v Speaker 1>that Islam is a religion of peace.</v>

54
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We saw that one when Martin Luther</v>

55
00:03:07.411 --> 00:03:09.750
<v Speaker 2>hammered some stuff on a door a long</v>
<v Speaker 2>time ago,</v>

56
00:03:09.751 --> 00:03:12.450
<v Speaker 2>and the Protestants and the Catholics</v>
<v Speaker 2>just went their separate ways.</v>

57
00:03:12.451 --> 00:03:14.580
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's been some rough feelings</v>

58
00:03:14.581 --> 00:03:15.810
<v Speaker 2>over the years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose,</v>

59
00:03:15.811 --> 00:03:19.740
<v Speaker 2>but no generational wars that I can</v>
<v Speaker 2>think of.</v>

60
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

61
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.651
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

62
00:03:22.651 --> 00:03:23.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was plenty,</v>

63
00:03:23.521 --> 00:03:24.710
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you said there was,</v>

64
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.980
<v Speaker 1>there's been plenty of Christian schism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the other thing too is that it's not</v>

65
00:03:28.981 --> 00:03:31.770
<v Speaker 1>that easy to lay those at the feet of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ.</v>

66
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:33.510
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>

67
00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.510
<v Speaker 1>because just even merely as an</v>
<v Speaker 1>architectural figure,</v>

68
00:03:36.511 --> 00:03:37.021
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

69
00:03:37.021 --> 00:03:37.591
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

70
00:03:37.591 --> 00:03:41.760
<v Speaker 1>as the western world's hypothesis of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideal man.</v>

71
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a moral character,</v>

72
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.150
<v Speaker 1>he was pretty much above reproach and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

73
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.680
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult for me to say the same</v>

74
00:03:52.681 --> 00:03:55.950
<v Speaker 1>thing about Mohamad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that might be because I'm an</v>

75
00:03:55.951 --> 00:04:00.930
<v Speaker 1>ignorant old western white guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like I'm doing my best man.</v>

76
00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big hit by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a dow is in for example,</v>

77
00:04:03.931 --> 00:04:07.920
<v Speaker 1>and there's great wisdom in Daoism and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've found value,</v>

78
00:04:07.921 --> 00:04:11.490
<v Speaker 1>real value in and so much of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>religious reading that I did,</v>

79
00:04:11.491 --> 00:04:14.550
<v Speaker 1>I've done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm really stumbling with Islam.</v>

80
00:04:14.551 --> 00:04:19.551
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard for me to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see it as other than a primarily</v>

81
00:04:21.841 --> 00:04:23.010
<v Speaker 1>political system</v>

82
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.380
<v Speaker 2>and did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's how it's being a imply</v>

83
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.170
<v Speaker 2>enforced right now with WWE.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what Isis is all about.</v>

84
00:04:30.171 --> 00:04:32.630
<v Speaker 2>You know there were state establish a</v>
<v Speaker 2>religious caliphate,</v>

85
00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>across the borders of two two countries.</v>

86
00:04:35.331 --> 00:04:35.990
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

87
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.840
<v Speaker 2>it's less about when I think of</v>
<v Speaker 2>religion,</v>

88
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.940
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I think of like the Christian</v>

89
00:04:40.941 --> 00:04:42.710
<v Speaker 2>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how it's applied here in my home state</v>

90
00:04:42.711 --> 00:04:43.560
<v Speaker 2>of Georgia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

91
00:04:43.561 --> 00:04:47.070
<v Speaker 2>it's w w when when we go to church and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we tied,</v>

92
00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.180
<v Speaker 2>that has very little to do with politics</v>
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>

93
00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.671
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's that,</v>

94
00:04:50.671 --> 00:04:52.850
<v Speaker 2>there's this huge massive separation</v>
<v Speaker 2>between religion,</v>

95
00:04:52.851 --> 00:04:54.590
<v Speaker 2>politics for the most part in the u s</v>
<v Speaker 2>and could be,</v>

96
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.520
<v Speaker 2>there are moments of ambiguity and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and tempers flare over and I'm a</v>

97
00:04:58.521 --> 00:05:00.440
<v Speaker 2>monument on this piece of property or</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

98
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.320
<v Speaker 2>but that's as stiff as it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

99
00:05:02.321 --> 00:05:06.950
<v Speaker 2>like the scariest bit of that that I can</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember some drunk fellow ran over a</v>

100
00:05:06.951 --> 00:05:09.770
<v Speaker 2>monument for the 10 commandments a few</v>
<v Speaker 2>months ago and tipped it over.</v>

101
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.410
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

102
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.750
<v Speaker 2>like that's what happens when,</v>

103
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.540
<v Speaker 3>and a critical point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

104
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.350
<v Speaker 3>like if you're not a Christian Kyle and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

105
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christian kind of alcove there and</v>

106
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.020
<v Speaker 3>Georgia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one ever is going to come to you and</v>

107
00:05:22.021 --> 00:05:23.850
<v Speaker 3>say you have to pay a different rate of</v>
<v Speaker 3>taxes.</v>

108
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.550
<v Speaker 3>You have to go to different stores,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to the religious who are,</v>

109
00:05:26.551 --> 00:05:27.780
<v Speaker 3>will not be enforced</v>

110
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.350
<v Speaker 2>as a law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

111
00:05:29.351 --> 00:05:30.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to lose any hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

112
00:05:30.671 --> 00:05:31.310
<v Speaker 2>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I,</v>

113
00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:32.410
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>

114
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Bible has many restrictions that it</v>

115
00:05:34.841 --> 00:05:38.270
<v Speaker 2>places on Christians and I ignore all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>them virtual,</v>

116
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I don't,</v>

117
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.730
<v Speaker 2>I know there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's no,</v>

118
00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:44.400
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

119
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.690
<v Speaker 2>religious police to come and kick my</v>
<v Speaker 2>door in and drag me away and torture me</v>

120
00:05:48.691 --> 00:05:50.880
<v Speaker 2>and threatened my family and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and well,</v>

121
00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:53.150
<v Speaker 1>it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's other,</v>

122
00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:58.210
<v Speaker 1>there's other cataclysms that that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>on that exist on the conception in the</v>

123
00:05:59.541 --> 00:06:01.160
<v Speaker 1>conceptual realm as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

124
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.353
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

125
00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.680
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the states dominated by Islam are not</v>

126
00:06:06.681 --> 00:06:11.060
<v Speaker 1>economically productive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's quite an interesting mystery</v>

127
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:12.613
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

128
00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:16.140
<v Speaker 1>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and many of the,</v>

129
00:06:16.141 --> 00:06:21.141
<v Speaker 1>and many of the Islamic states that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>purport to regard as allies hold values</v>

130
00:06:22.291 --> 00:06:27.291
<v Speaker 1>that are antithetical to our system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a Saudi Arabia is a classic example</v>

131
00:06:27.601 --> 00:06:30.150
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I cannot for the life of me</v>

132
00:06:30.151 --> 00:06:35.151
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except in a psychoanalytic manner why</v>

133
00:06:35.191 --> 00:06:39.770
<v Speaker 1>the radical feminists tolerate America's</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lli.</v>

134
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.530
<v Speaker 1>America's lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that America is allied with the</v>

135
00:06:43.531 --> 00:06:45.000
<v Speaker 1>Saudis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just absent.</v>

136
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.470
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

137
00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.140
<v Speaker 1>it's not much different as far as I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned,</v>

138
00:06:49.141 --> 00:06:52.320
<v Speaker 1>that it would be if black people didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>say anything.</v>

139
00:06:52.321 --> 00:06:57.270
<v Speaker 1>If America was allied with a slave or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>black slave owning state,</v>

140
00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.150
<v Speaker 1>which of course also happens in Saudi</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabia by the way.</v>

141
00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.350
<v Speaker 3>So when did the feminist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's gotta be because Muslims right now</v>

142
00:07:04.351 --> 00:07:06.700
<v Speaker 3>are higher up on the victim hierarchy</v>
<v Speaker 3>than then.</v>

143
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:10.310
<v Speaker 3>So even if it's way over there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not allowed to speak out against</v>

144
00:07:10.311 --> 00:07:10.670
<v Speaker 3>sir,</v>

145
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:14.810
<v Speaker 1>I think it's their unconscious wish for</v>
<v Speaker 1>brutal male domination.</v>

146
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.143
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

147
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.411
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like that.</v>

148
00:07:18.411 --> 00:07:21.800
<v Speaker 2>That's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the left's ability to</v>

149
00:07:21.801 --> 00:07:26.210
<v Speaker 2>apologize for anything that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that people on the left,</v>

150
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:31.940
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm just as crazy as you guys are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the Muslims are oppressed women.</v>

151
00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:32.840
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's cultural.</v>

152
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:35.360
<v Speaker 2>We need to understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh guys think they're girls.</v>

153
00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:36.051
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

154
00:07:36.051 --> 00:07:37.610
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to understand where they're</v>

155
00:07:37.611 --> 00:07:38.840
<v Speaker 2>coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything.</v>

156
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.650
<v Speaker 2>They're so open minded to egg excuse</v>
<v Speaker 2>making,</v>

157
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:42.900
<v Speaker 2>even if it's horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

158
00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:46.260
<v Speaker 1>That's also the agreeableness say and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>were talking about earlier.</v>

159
00:07:46.261 --> 00:07:47.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because agreeable,</v>

160
00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:50.350
<v Speaker 1>agreeable people agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

161
00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.620
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why the term exists.</v>

162
00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:54.450
<v Speaker 1>And yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there is a real uh,</v>

163
00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:57.450
<v Speaker 1>Poland and if you ally that with high</v>
<v Speaker 1>openness,</v>

164
00:07:57.451 --> 00:07:59.490
<v Speaker 1>which is that open mindedness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

165
00:07:59.491 --> 00:08:02.790
<v Speaker 1>that it's associated creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get agreeable openness.</v>

166
00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:04.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's definitely,</v>

167
00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:07.750
<v Speaker 2>and he goes</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

168
00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:11.860
<v Speaker 2>And I'll forgive you beating your wife</v>
<v Speaker 2>often if you're low in</v>

169
00:08:11.861 --> 00:08:15.460
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything you keeping really goes,</v>

170
00:08:15.461 --> 00:08:17.830
<v Speaker 2>then bill more puts it nicely when he</v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

171
00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:21.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the left would not for one second be</v>

172
00:08:21.371 --> 00:08:23.710
<v Speaker 2>okay with apartheid in South Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

173
00:08:23.711 --> 00:08:26.260
<v Speaker 2>They would just banging that drum hating</v>
<v Speaker 2>every second of the way.</v>

174
00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:31.030
<v Speaker 2>But for some reason the oppression of</v>
<v Speaker 2>women in Saudi Arabia has gotten a</v>

175
00:08:31.031 --> 00:08:32.440
<v Speaker 2>complete pass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

176
00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:36.070
<v Speaker 2>And it's a real deal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

177
00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:39.270
<v Speaker 2>say it's real deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

178
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:40.840
<v Speaker 2>Heck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the driving thing alone.</v>

179
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:44.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Taylor,</v>

180
00:08:44.681 --> 00:08:46.840
<v Speaker 2>can you hold that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They liked her.</v>

181
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I broke up.</v>

182
00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:50.470
<v Speaker 2>You broke it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We couldn't hear what you were saying.</v>

183
00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:52.420
<v Speaker 2>You're still a little frozen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

184
00:08:52.421 --> 00:08:53.254
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

185
00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:54.730
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just taking away their ability to drive,</v>

186
00:08:54.731 --> 00:08:56.730
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women don't have mobility without men.</v>

187
00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:00.660
<v Speaker 2>That is hugely oppressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you made that change in America and</v>

188
00:09:00.661 --> 00:09:05.580
<v Speaker 2>none other than when you're walking</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuck at home than you actually don't</v>

189
00:09:05.581 --> 00:09:06.414
<v Speaker 2>see</v>

190
00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:11.460
<v Speaker 1>a more concrete embodiment of the idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>of individual autonomy than the</v>

191
00:09:11.471 --> 00:09:13.300
<v Speaker 1>automobile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

192
00:09:13.301 --> 00:09:16.930
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe it was the Soviet Union's</v>
<v Speaker 1>import and then,</v>

193
00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:18.000
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

194
00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:19.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>manufacturer.</v>

195
00:09:19.361 --> 00:09:21.640
<v Speaker 1>If the automobile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the doom communism,</v>

196
00:09:21.641 --> 00:09:25.870
<v Speaker 1>because nothing screams autonomous</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual like a car,</v>

197
00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:28.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You drive it yourself.</v>

198
00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:31.120
<v Speaker 1>You can go on any road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one tells you what to do.</v>

199
00:09:31.121 --> 00:09:35.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that women can't drive in</v>

200
00:09:35.411 --> 00:09:37.540
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it tells the entire story.</v>

201
00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:42.750
<v Speaker 1>And so the fact I cannot understand for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the life of me why we are so blind in</v>

202
00:09:43.601 --> 00:09:45.790
<v Speaker 1>the west,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we make the assumption that those</v>

203
00:09:45.791 --> 00:09:48.930
<v Speaker 1>people are our allies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like in what</v>

204
00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:49.923
<v Speaker 2>Jay</v>

205
00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:52.790
<v Speaker 1>and things have switched around the lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

206
00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.460
<v Speaker 1>America is now an oil exporting country</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

207
00:09:56.210 --> 00:10:01.210
<v Speaker 1>and you guys have been doing pretty good</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the fracking for natural gas front.</v>

208
00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:03.950
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing that's quite a bit worth</v>

209
00:10:03.951 --> 00:10:08.951
<v Speaker 1>considering is that if the west wanted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to reduce its reliance on Middle Eastern</v>

210
00:10:09.321 --> 00:10:11.600
<v Speaker 1>oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can turn to Alberta and the tar</v>

211
00:10:11.601 --> 00:10:13.460
<v Speaker 1>sands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's enough bloody oil there for,</v>

212
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:17.030
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the rest of humanity for the rest of</v>

213
00:10:17.031 --> 00:10:17.781
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

214
00:10:17.781 --> 00:10:20.570
<v Speaker 1>and it's a bit messy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't obvious to me that it's</v>

215
00:10:20.571 --> 00:10:23.240
<v Speaker 1>better than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's worse than dumping $1 trillion</v>

216
00:10:23.241 --> 00:10:26.420
<v Speaker 1>every five or six years into the coffers</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Saudi princes.</v>

217
00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:32.420
<v Speaker 1>Especially given there are obvious</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for distributing the</v>

218
00:10:32.421 --> 00:10:35.930
<v Speaker 1>most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most vicious Wahhabis propaganda all</v>

219
00:10:35.931 --> 00:10:37.720
<v Speaker 1>over the world with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

220
00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.910
<v Speaker 1>which is something that a fair chunk of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that petro money goes to.</v>
