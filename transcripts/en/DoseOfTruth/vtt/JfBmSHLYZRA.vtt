1
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.210
<v Speaker 1>And so a lot of initiation rights,</v>

2
00:00:08.211 --> 00:00:09.044
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

3
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.100
<v Speaker 1>are predicated on the idea that you take the person out of their childhood</v>

4
00:00:13.101 --> 00:00:13.934
<v Speaker 1>context,</v>

5
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.970
<v Speaker 1>you destroy their personality usually as a consequence of some traumatic and</v>

6
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:24.030
<v Speaker 1>counter and then you refill them with the cultural norms and that makes them an</v>

7
00:00:24.411 --> 00:00:25.244
<v Speaker 1>adult.</v>

8
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.731
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

9
00:00:25.731 --> 00:00:26.001
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:26.631
<v Speaker 1>to some degree,</v>

11
00:00:26.631 --> 00:00:30.800
<v Speaker 1>that's what you guys are doing in a very slow way when you make the transition</v>

12
00:00:30.801 --> 00:00:33.930
<v Speaker 1>from high school to university or the transition from high school to a,</v>

13
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.180
<v Speaker 1>to a job.</v>

14
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.931
<v Speaker 1>We don't,</v>

15
00:00:35.931 --> 00:00:36.501
<v Speaker 1>in our culture,</v>

16
00:00:36.501 --> 00:00:40.640
<v Speaker 1>we don't have the kind of abrupt ceremonies though that are designed to catalyze</v>

17
00:00:40.641 --> 00:00:41.600
<v Speaker 1>that transformation.</v>

18
00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:42.141
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

19
00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:43.310
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's an okay thing.</v>

20
00:00:43.311 --> 00:00:45.800
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe it's not an okay thing.</v>

21
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.221
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

22
00:00:46.221 --> 00:00:47.840
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that Freud pointed out,</v>

23
00:00:47.841 --> 00:00:49.520
<v Speaker 1>and he's absolutely right about this,</v>

24
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:50.703
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

25
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.590
<v Speaker 1>is that because human beings have such a long dependency period,</v>

26
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.810
<v Speaker 1>it's not that easy for us to grow up.</v>

27
00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.990
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes it takes a shock in order for that to happen.</v>

28
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.470
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the potential problems with having a dependency period as long as</v>

29
00:01:06.021 --> 00:01:11.021
<v Speaker 1>the human dependency period is that it never ends and that you stay immature</v>

30
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.163
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>

31
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.320
<v Speaker 1>And really I believe that that's the central problem that Freud talked about.</v>

32
00:01:17.361 --> 00:01:19.190
<v Speaker 1>And I believe also that it's a real problem.</v>

33
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.240
<v Speaker 1>Now whether Freud formulated it with precise accuracy,</v>

34
00:01:23.241 --> 00:01:24.140
<v Speaker 1>that's a different story.</v>

35
00:01:24.141 --> 00:01:24.741
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

36
00:01:24.741 --> 00:01:25.970
<v Speaker 1>you gotta give the guy a break,</v>

37
00:01:25.971 --> 00:01:28.010
<v Speaker 1>at least he formulated an and it's.</v>

38
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was much more impressed with Freud,</v>

39
00:01:31.021 --> 00:01:35.900
<v Speaker 1>you depaul theorizing after I did clinical work for a long time because a large</v>

40
00:01:35.901 --> 00:01:36.920
<v Speaker 1>number of my patients,</v>

41
00:01:36.921 --> 00:01:39.860
<v Speaker 1>their primary problem is getting the hell out of their family.</v>

42
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.970
<v Speaker 1>They just can't do it.</v>

43
00:01:40.971 --> 00:01:44.150
<v Speaker 1>And so for them the world is the family.</v>

44
00:01:44.151 --> 00:01:45.410
<v Speaker 1>It's the only thing that matters.</v>

45
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.510
<v Speaker 1>It's often parental opinion or something like that.</v>

46
00:01:47.511 --> 00:01:49.130
<v Speaker 1>They just cannot break free of it.</v>

47
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:50.690
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

48
00:01:50.691 --> 00:01:54.020
<v Speaker 1>initiation ceremonies in part were designed to catalyze that,</v>

49
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.050
<v Speaker 1>that break so that your,</v>

50
00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.410
<v Speaker 1>your mother in particular,</v>

51
00:01:57.411 --> 00:01:59.000
<v Speaker 1>but also your father to some degree.</v>

52
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.160
<v Speaker 1>We're no longer the dominant figures have influenced your personal mother and</v>

53
00:02:04.161 --> 00:02:07.250
<v Speaker 1>father were no longer that dominant figures of influence in your life,</v>

54
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.670
<v Speaker 1>so because really that's what he maturation means in some sense is that when you</v>

55
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.090
<v Speaker 1>become an adult,</v>

56
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.220
<v Speaker 1>the opinions of your parents are as important as the opinions of any other</v>

57
00:02:19.221 --> 00:02:21.860
<v Speaker 1>reasonable people that hypothetically care for you.</v>

58
00:02:21.861 --> 00:02:23.450
<v Speaker 1>But no more important than that.</v>
