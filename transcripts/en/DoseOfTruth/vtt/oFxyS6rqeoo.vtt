1
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.470
<v Speaker 1>And I was reading this other book while back as well,</v>

2
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.060
<v Speaker 1>which was written by the guy who ran the heat human genome project.</v>

3
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:18.640
<v Speaker 1>And I don't remember exactly what it was called,</v>

4
00:00:18.641 --> 00:00:20.940
<v Speaker 1>but it was something like a scientist's case for God.</v>

5
00:00:20.941 --> 00:00:21.820
<v Speaker 1>There's something like that.</v>

6
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.460
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things he referred to,</v>

7
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.730
<v Speaker 1>which didn't strike me as hard as it should have to begin with,</v>

8
00:00:27.731 --> 00:00:29.690
<v Speaker 1>was the he,</v>

9
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.011
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

10
00:00:30.011 --> 00:00:35.011
<v Speaker 1>he thought that one of the phenomena say that justified a belief in a</v>

11
00:00:35.561 --> 00:00:40.000
<v Speaker 1>transcendent being with something like the moral intuition of human beings that,</v>

12
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.810
<v Speaker 1>we have a sense of right and wrong and uh,</v>

14
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.541
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:00:43.541 --> 00:00:47.150
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly what happens in genesis and the story of Adam and eve is that,</v>

16
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.120
<v Speaker 1>that that story announces the coming of the sense of right and wrong,</v>

17
00:00:52.121 --> 00:00:52.331
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

18
00:00:52.331 --> 00:00:53.380
<v Speaker 1>The knowledge of good and evil.</v>

19
00:00:53.381 --> 00:00:55.210
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't something we ascribed to animals.</v>

20
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.340
<v Speaker 1>It's something that's unique to human beings.</v>

21
00:00:57.341 --> 00:00:59.950
<v Speaker 1>Animals can be predators and you know,</v>

22
00:00:59.951 --> 00:01:01.740
<v Speaker 1>and they can be gentle and,</v>

23
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.790
<v Speaker 1>and you can have a relationship with them,</v>

24
00:01:03.791 --> 00:01:06.490
<v Speaker 1>but you never think of an evil cat or you know,</v>

25
00:01:06.491 --> 00:01:07.420
<v Speaker 1>or an evil wolf.</v>

26
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:08.283
<v Speaker 1>Even though they're,</v>

27
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.041
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

28
00:01:09.041 --> 00:01:09.940
<v Speaker 1>they're predatory.</v>

29
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.143
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

30
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:12.880
<v Speaker 1>but human beings,</v>

31
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.960
<v Speaker 1>we have this capacity to judge between good and evil,</v>

32
00:01:16.961 --> 00:01:17.620
<v Speaker 1>right and wrong.</v>

33
00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.960
<v Speaker 1>And it's really an integral part of our,</v>

34
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.883
<v Speaker 1>our being.</v>

35
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.170
<v Speaker 1>And I think you can make an evolutionary case for that,</v>

36
00:01:23.171 --> 00:01:28.171
<v Speaker 1>a biological case for that as you can make a biological case for most of what is</v>

37
00:01:29.921 --> 00:01:32.590
<v Speaker 1>relevant about human beings because we're biological creatures,</v>

38
00:01:32.591 --> 00:01:35.980
<v Speaker 1>but we don't really understand the significance of that.</v>

39
00:01:35.981 --> 00:01:38.560
<v Speaker 1>Like what happens in the story of Adam and eve is that,</v>

40
00:01:38.561 --> 00:01:42.070
<v Speaker 1>that's that realization that coming to the knowledge of good and evil is</v>

41
00:01:42.071 --> 00:01:45.040
<v Speaker 1>actually represented as a shift of cosmic significance,</v>

42
00:01:45.041 --> 00:01:45.220
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

43
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.000
<v Speaker 1>It puts a,</v>

44
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.090
<v Speaker 1>it puts a permanent fracture in the structure of [inaudible].</v>

45
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.410
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

46
00:01:50.411 --> 00:01:54.280
<v Speaker 1>if you think of human beings as insignificant and so on,</v>

47
00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.190
<v Speaker 1>a tiny dust mote in the middle of an infinite cosmos,</v>

48
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.220
<v Speaker 1>a cosmos that cares less for us,</v>

49
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.900
<v Speaker 1>then who cares?</v>

50
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:02.591
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally,</v>

51
00:02:02.591 --> 00:02:06.340
<v Speaker 1>if human beings have the knowledge to distinguish between good and evil.</v>

52
00:02:06.341 --> 00:02:09.730
<v Speaker 1>But if you give consciousness a central role in being,</v>

53
00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.070
<v Speaker 1>and you can make a perfectly reasonable case for that,</v>

54
00:02:12.071 --> 00:02:16.480
<v Speaker 1>because without consciousness there's no being as far as anyone can determine.</v>

55
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.270
<v Speaker 1>So it may be much more central than we think.</v>

56
00:02:19.271 --> 00:02:19.480
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

57
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.313
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

58
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.051
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

59
00:02:21.051 --> 00:02:23.290
<v Speaker 1>I really don't think there's a counter argument to that,</v>

60
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.180
<v Speaker 1>like not a solid one.</v>

61
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.850
<v Speaker 1>You can state that consciousnesses epet phenomenal and,</v>

62
00:02:27.851 --> 00:02:30.310
<v Speaker 1>and that the world is fundamentally materialistic.</v>

63
00:02:30.311 --> 00:02:32.350
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't matter that there's consciousness,</v>

64
00:02:32.351 --> 00:02:33.310
<v Speaker 1>you can state that,</v>

65
00:02:33.311 --> 00:02:35.290
<v Speaker 1>but you can make an equally credible case.</v>

66
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.123
<v Speaker 1>The other way,</v>

67
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.400
<v Speaker 1>and certainly our lived experience is that consciousness is crucial obviously.</v>

68
00:02:41.771 --> 00:02:46.300
<v Speaker 1>And we treat each other as if most of the time we're valuable conscious beings</v>

69
00:02:46.301 --> 00:02:50.170
<v Speaker 1>and we wouldn't give up our consciousness even though it's often consciousness</v>

70
00:02:50.171 --> 00:02:51.004
<v Speaker 1>of suffering.</v>

71
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.900
<v Speaker 1>And so then I think another problem with the book is that it's,</v>

72
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.990
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of predicated on the idea that life is for happiness.</v>

73
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.150
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think that's right.</v>

74
00:03:01.151 --> 00:03:03.370
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think that's how people experience life.</v>

75
00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:04.450
<v Speaker 1>And I might be wrong,</v>

76
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.720
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to me that people experience life as something like a series of</v>

77
00:03:10.631 --> 00:03:12.640
<v Speaker 1>crucial ethical decisions.</v>

78
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.050
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

79
00:03:14.051 --> 00:03:14.884
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

80
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.320
<v Speaker 1>when I just can't imagine,</v>

81
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.620
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm being naive about this,</v>

82
00:03:20.621 --> 00:03:22.480
<v Speaker 1>but I can't imagine that.</v>

83
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.200
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine another being that's like me in most senses,</v>

84
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.780
<v Speaker 1>that isn't constantly wrestling in some sense with what the next proper thing to</v>

85
00:03:35.111 --> 00:03:35.590
<v Speaker 1>do is.</v>

86
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.730
<v Speaker 1>It's not like it's obvious.</v>

87
00:03:36.731 --> 00:03:40.930
<v Speaker 1>It's not bloody obvious and it doesn't mean you'll do the right thing cause you</v>

88
00:03:40.931 --> 00:03:45.340
<v Speaker 1>don't law lots of times and you know that by your own judgment,</v>

89
00:03:45.341 --> 00:03:45.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

90
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.080
<v Speaker 1>Cause you're making mistakes all the time.</v>

91
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.810
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you don't know what you're doing and maybe it's a mistake and maybe it</v>

92
00:03:49.811 --> 00:03:50.500
<v Speaker 1>isn't.</v>

93
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.590
<v Speaker 1>And who's to say that isn't what I'm talking about.</v>

94
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about when you know that what you're doing is wrong and you go ahead</v>

95
00:03:55.751 --> 00:03:56.584
<v Speaker 1>and do it anyways.</v>

96
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:57.880
<v Speaker 1>People do that all the time.</v>

97
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.040
<v Speaker 1>And that's also extremely peculiar.</v>

98
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.610
<v Speaker 1>Bloody well think that if you knew it was wrong and you told yourself that it</v>

99
00:04:03.611 --> 00:04:04.300
<v Speaker 1>was wrong,</v>

100
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.850
<v Speaker 1>that that would be sufficient so that you would just wouldn't do it.</v>

101
00:04:06.851 --> 00:04:08.500
<v Speaker 1>But that isn't what you're like at all.</v>

102
00:04:08.501 --> 00:04:08.801
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

103
00:04:08.801 --> 00:04:12.430
<v Speaker 1>And you can tell yourself something is wrong a 50 times and you'll do it the</v>

104
00:04:12.431 --> 00:04:14.350
<v Speaker 1>51st time and then you'll feel,</v>

105
00:04:14.351 --> 00:04:14.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

106
00:04:14.651 --> 00:04:15.484
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

107
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.550
<v Speaker 1>like you deserve to feel probably and,</v>

108
00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:20.050
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't stop you.</v>

109
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.883
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

110
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.320
<v Speaker 1>so then I think the other problem with the,</v>

111
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.400
<v Speaker 1>the viewpoint,</v>

112
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.110
<v Speaker 1>the idea that the suffering of life eradicates its utility is that it's</v>

113
00:04:29.111 --> 00:04:33.880
<v Speaker 1>predicated on the idea that happiness or lack of suffering even is,</v>

114
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.910
<v Speaker 1>is the right criteria by which to judge life.</v>

115
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.020
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think that's how we actually experience life.</v>

116
00:04:41.021 --> 00:04:46.021
<v Speaker 1>I think what we do instead is put ourselves through a series of excruciating</v>

117
00:04:46.061 --> 00:04:47.590
<v Speaker 1>moral choices.</v>

118
00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.721
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

119
00:04:48.721 --> 00:04:53.200
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that that's really significant about the biblical stories</v>

120
00:04:53.201 --> 00:04:54.270
<v Speaker 1>and I think about the,</v>

121
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.410
<v Speaker 1>the entire implicit philosophy,</v>

122
00:04:59.411 --> 00:04:59.681
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

123
00:04:59.681 --> 00:05:01.120
<v Speaker 1>that's embedded in the stories,</v>

124
00:05:01.121 --> 00:05:04.810
<v Speaker 1>is that that's how life is presented in the stories,</v>

125
00:05:04.811 --> 00:05:06.490
<v Speaker 1>is all of these individuals,</v>

126
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.260
<v Speaker 1>first their individuals to not groups.</v>

127
00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:09.363
<v Speaker 1>And second,</v>

128
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.550
<v Speaker 1>they're agonizing over their moral choices all the time,</v>

129
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:13.563
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

130
00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.000
<v Speaker 1>And they have a relationship with God.</v>

131
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:17.140
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

132
00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.973
<v Speaker 1>but it's not,</v>

133
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.230
<v Speaker 1>it's not a directive relationship.</v>

134
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.041
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

135
00:05:21.041 --> 00:05:24.640
<v Speaker 1>Even the people to whom God speaks directly,</v>

136
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.970
<v Speaker 1>which I suspect is not something you'd exactly want to have happen,</v>

137
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.470
<v Speaker 1>is it's,</v>

138
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.440
<v Speaker 1>there's still the f even the fact that they have a direct relationship with God</v>

139
00:05:35.441 --> 00:05:39.430
<v Speaker 1>doesn't stop them from being tormented continually by their moral choices.</v>

140
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.230
<v Speaker 1>And so the world is presented as a moral landscape,</v>

141
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:45.483
<v Speaker 1>not as a,</v>

142
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.610
<v Speaker 1>not as a place that justifies itself by happiness.</v>

143
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.590
<v Speaker 1>It's presented as a moral landscape and people are presented as creatures who</v>

144
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.750
<v Speaker 1>traverse through the moral landscape,</v>

145
00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.230
<v Speaker 1>making ethical decisions that determine the course of the world.</v>

146
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:02.600
<v Speaker 1>And that seems to me to be right.</v>

147
00:06:02.601 --> 00:06:03.440
<v Speaker 1>And that's not a,</v>

148
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.620
<v Speaker 1>that's not the same as happiness by any stretch of the imagination.</v>

149
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.860
<v Speaker 1>It's a whole different category of being and,</v>

150
00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:12.160
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

151
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.890
<v Speaker 1>And then I've thought that through a lot and I think,</v>

152
00:06:13.891 --> 00:06:14.400
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

153
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.480
<v Speaker 1>we do make choices and what we do is contend with the future,</v>

154
00:06:18.481 --> 00:06:19.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

155
00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.460
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

156
00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.500
<v Speaker 1>the future seems to appear to us as a realm of possibility.</v>

157
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.850
<v Speaker 1>It that's a more accurate way of thinking about it then then that the future</v>

158
00:06:26.851 --> 00:06:28.230
<v Speaker 1>presents itself to it.</v>

159
00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.800
<v Speaker 1>To us as a realm of determined things.</v>

160
00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.400
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

161
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.910
<v Speaker 1>it's presents itself as a realm of possibility and there's good choices in that</v>

162
00:06:35.911 --> 00:06:39.600
<v Speaker 1>realm and there's poor choices or even evil choices in that realm.</v>

163
00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:44.820
<v Speaker 1>And we're negotiating continually deciding which of those choices we're going to</v>

164
00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:45.810
<v Speaker 1>bring into being.</v>

165
00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:49.680
<v Speaker 1>That seems to me to be phenomenologically indisputable.</v>

166
00:06:49.681 --> 00:06:53.250
<v Speaker 1>And we certainly treat each other as if that's what we're doing because we hold</v>

167
00:06:53.251 --> 00:06:54.870
<v Speaker 1>each other responsible for our actions,</v>

168
00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:55.261
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

169
00:06:55.261 --> 00:06:56.370
<v Speaker 1>with some exceptions.</v>

170
00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:01.850
<v Speaker 1>And that we're deciding each moment whether to make things better or worse.</v>

171
00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:03.733
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

172
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:06.620
<v Speaker 1>that seems to me to be correct.</v>

173
00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.490
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's what these stories illustrate.</v>

174
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.130
<v Speaker 1>They don't say that directly,</v>

175
00:07:13.131 --> 00:07:13.521
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

176
00:07:13.521 --> 00:07:17.060
<v Speaker 1>although I think it gets more and more explicit as the narrative unfolds.</v>

177
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:18.583
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

178
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.810
<v Speaker 1>and then part of the realism of the stories,</v>

179
00:07:20.811 --> 00:07:21.330
<v Speaker 1>is that right?</v>

180
00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:22.163
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

181
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.230
<v Speaker 1>The people aren't,</v>

182
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:28.190
<v Speaker 1>the people that are being presented are by no means good.</v>

183
00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:28.611
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

184
00:07:28.611 --> 00:07:30.020
<v Speaker 1>maybe with the exception of Noah,</v>

185
00:07:30.021 --> 00:07:31.280
<v Speaker 1>Noah seem to be a pretty good guy.</v>

186
00:07:31.281 --> 00:07:31.670
<v Speaker 1>All they did,</v>

187
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:33.620
<v Speaker 1>he did get drunk and you know,</v>

188
00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:34.040
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

189
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:34.460
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

190
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.700
<v Speaker 1>and end up naked exposed to his sons and so forth.</v>

191
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:38.833
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

192
00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:40.450
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

193
00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:40.761
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

194
00:07:40.761 --> 00:07:42.910
<v Speaker 1>he isn't talked about a lot as a character.</v>

195
00:07:42.911 --> 00:07:44.080
<v Speaker 1>It's a pretty compressed story.</v>

196
00:07:44.081 --> 00:07:44.801
<v Speaker 1>But Abraham,</v>

197
00:07:44.801 --> 00:07:45.071
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

198
00:07:45.071 --> 00:07:46.600
<v Speaker 1>Abraham had plenty of problems,</v>

199
00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:49.450
<v Speaker 1>not least of which was in his inability to leave home.</v>

200
00:07:49.451 --> 00:07:50.250
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

201
00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:50.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

202
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.200
<v Speaker 1>he's lying about his wife and there,</v>

203
00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.680
<v Speaker 1>there's all sorts of mistakes.</v>

204
00:07:53.681 --> 00:07:54.461
<v Speaker 1>And then Jacob,</v>

205
00:07:54.461 --> 00:07:59.461
<v Speaker 1>who we're going to talk about tonight is an even more morally ambivalent</v>

206
00:08:00.701 --> 00:08:01.534
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>

207
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.050
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

208
00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:03.700
<v Speaker 1>especially at the beginning of the story,</v>

209
00:08:03.701 --> 00:08:04.534
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

210
00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:06.350
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

211
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:07.183
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

212
00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:11.300
<v Speaker 1>he isn't the sort of person that you would pick out.</v>

213
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.090
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you are a hack writer.</v>

214
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.640
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't pick him out as the hero of the story.</v>

215
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:20.710
<v Speaker 1>He does a lot of things that are really pretty reprehensible and take some,</v>

216
00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.400
<v Speaker 1>an awful long time to learn better.</v>

217
00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:27.650
<v Speaker 1>And yet he's the person who's put forward as the father of the 12 tribes of</v>

218
00:08:27.651 --> 00:08:28.071
<v Speaker 1>Israel.</v>

219
00:08:28.071 --> 00:08:31.930
<v Speaker 1>It's from this flawed person that the people that,</v>

220
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.070
<v Speaker 1>that maybe that,</v>

221
00:08:34.071 --> 00:08:39.071
<v Speaker 1>whose story you might say is at the fundamental constitutes the fundamental</v>

222
00:08:39.531 --> 00:08:40.940
<v Speaker 1>underpinning of our culture.</v>

223
00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:46.040
<v Speaker 1>It's from this deeply flawed individual that that group emerges.</v>

224
00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:48.650
<v Speaker 1>And so you might think of it out as a relief too,</v>

225
00:08:48.651 --> 00:08:49.880
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

226
00:08:49.881 --> 00:08:52.220
<v Speaker 1>you're no knight in shining armor,</v>

227
00:08:52.221 --> 00:08:52.521
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

228
00:08:52.521 --> 00:08:52.820
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

229
00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:53.540
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>

230
00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:55.680
<v Speaker 1>with the pure moral passed.</v>

231
00:08:55.681 --> 00:08:55.921
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

232
00:08:55.921 --> 00:09:00.180
<v Speaker 1>people make mistakes of catastrophic proportions nonstop,</v>

233
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:01.043
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

234
00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:06.000
<v Speaker 1>and that also means that these stories put forward something approximating hope</v>

235
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:08.160
<v Speaker 1>because in their realism,</v>

236
00:09:08.161 --> 00:09:09.480
<v Speaker 1>in their moral realism,</v>

237
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.540
<v Speaker 1>they present heroes,</v>

238
00:09:12.541 --> 00:09:14.400
<v Speaker 1>I suppose the heroes of renowned,</v>

239
00:09:14.401 --> 00:09:14.641
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

240
00:09:14.641 --> 00:09:15.840
<v Speaker 1>The Patriarchs of old,</v>

241
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:16.703
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

242
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:19.200
<v Speaker 1>who are realistic,</v>

243
00:09:19.201 --> 00:09:24.201
<v Speaker 1>people who have fits of anger and rage and who are murderous at times and who</v>

244
00:09:24.421 --> 00:09:25.254
<v Speaker 1>are deeply,</v>

245
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:29.560
<v Speaker 1>deeply embroiled with family dispute and,</v>

246
00:09:29.561 --> 00:09:30.394
<v Speaker 1>and who,</v>

247
00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:32.400
<v Speaker 1>who have adulterous affairs.</v>

248
00:09:32.401 --> 00:09:32.711
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

249
00:09:32.711 --> 00:09:35.940
<v Speaker 1>and like they do all of the terrible things that people do.</v>

250
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:37.710
<v Speaker 1>And the weird thing is,</v>

251
00:09:37.711 --> 00:09:39.810
<v Speaker 1>is that God is still with them.</v>

252
00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:41.693
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

253
00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:42.761
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

254
00:09:42.761 --> 00:09:47.140
<v Speaker 1>it isn't obvious what that means or even if it means anything,</v>

255
00:09:47.141 --> 00:09:49.300
<v Speaker 1>but it's very,</v>

256
00:09:49.301 --> 00:09:54.070
<v Speaker 1>it's not disputable as far as I can tell that a we're conscious and that</v>

257
00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.160
<v Speaker 1>consciousness is a transcendent phenomena which,</v>

258
00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:58.570
<v Speaker 1>which we do not understand.</v>

259
00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:01.900
<v Speaker 1>And that the landscape that we traverse through his moral,</v>

260
00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:03.970
<v Speaker 1>like every story you ever watch,</v>

261
00:10:03.971 --> 00:10:07.000
<v Speaker 1>anything that grips your imagination on the screen or in the theater,</v>

262
00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:10.720
<v Speaker 1>like any story that grabs you is a story of moral striving.</v>

263
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.000
<v Speaker 1>It's just not interesting otherwise.</v>

264
00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:13.690
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

265
00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:17.320
<v Speaker 1>The person has to be confronted with complex moral choices and then you see the</v>

266
00:10:17.321 --> 00:10:18.370
<v Speaker 1>outcome and you know,</v>

267
00:10:18.371 --> 00:10:22.060
<v Speaker 1>the good guy does it right in the bad guy does it badly and things don't go so</v>

268
00:10:22.061 --> 00:10:23.860
<v Speaker 1>well for the bad guy generally.</v>

269
00:10:23.861 --> 00:10:25.570
<v Speaker 1>And if it's a bit more sophisticated,</v>

270
00:10:25.571 --> 00:10:28.120
<v Speaker 1>the good and the bad are in the same individual.</v>

271
00:10:28.121 --> 00:10:28.571
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

272
00:10:28.571 --> 00:10:28.811
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

273
00:10:28.811 --> 00:10:30.820
<v Speaker 1>that's a more compelling story.</v>

274
00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:32.223
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

275
00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.120
<v Speaker 1>so we could say,</v>

276
00:10:38.121 --> 00:10:38.331
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

277
00:10:38.331 --> 00:10:38.541
<v Speaker 1>let,</v>

278
00:10:38.541 --> 00:10:38.781
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

279
00:10:38.781 --> 00:10:42.350
<v Speaker 1>we could make the assumption that it might be worthwhile thinking of the world</v>

280
00:10:42.351 --> 00:10:43.184
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

281
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:47.870
<v Speaker 1>as it has been thought of classically as a theater upon which the forces of good</v>

282
00:10:47.871 --> 00:10:51.810
<v Speaker 1>and evil continually strive for dominance.</v>

283
00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:53.083
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

284
00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:54.650
<v Speaker 1>for the life of me,</v>

285
00:10:54.651 --> 00:10:58.580
<v Speaker 1>especially after I started reading deeply into 20th century history and all the</v>

286
00:10:58.581 --> 00:11:01.940
<v Speaker 1>terrible things that happened in the 20th century and all the terrible,</v>

287
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.290
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably incomprehensible things that people did to one another,</v>

288
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:11.510
<v Speaker 1>I just couldn't see seeing things any other way is realistic.</v>

289
00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:12.831
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

290
00:11:12.831 --> 00:11:17.460
<v Speaker 1>because I don't think that you can immerse yourself in 20th century history</v>

291
00:11:17.461 --> 00:11:19.860
<v Speaker 1>without coming to the conclusion that evil is a reality.</v>

292
00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.220
<v Speaker 1>And if it's a reality,</v>

293
00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:25.030
<v Speaker 1>it depends on what you mean by reality.</v>

294
00:11:25.031 --> 00:11:27.250
<v Speaker 1>But it's fundamental enough reality for me.</v>

295
00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:28.930
<v Speaker 1>And if it's a reality,</v>

296
00:11:28.931 --> 00:11:33.310
<v Speaker 1>then I don't see how you can escape from the conclusion that the cosmos,</v>

297
00:11:33.311 --> 00:11:34.480
<v Speaker 1>as we experience it,</v>

298
00:11:34.481 --> 00:11:37.810
<v Speaker 1>at least is a place of moral striving.</v>

299
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:40.210
<v Speaker 1>And well,</v>

300
00:11:40.211 --> 00:11:43.060
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the things that's really illustrated in the story of Jacob.</v>

301
00:11:43.061 --> 00:11:43.550
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

302
00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:45.370
<v Speaker 1>and I found that quite striking.</v>
