1
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.660
<v Speaker 1>So there is the church and the church is underneath the cross,</v>

2
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.080
<v Speaker 1>So that St Peter's Basilica.</v>

4
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.640
<v Speaker 1>And so there's the cross on the globe on top of the basilica,</v>

5
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.930
<v Speaker 1>and then there's the cross on the uh,</v>

6
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.650
<v Speaker 1>obelisk as well.</v>

7
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.620
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is that,</v>

8
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.470
<v Speaker 1>and this is where things get insanely complicated,</v>

9
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.930
<v Speaker 1>is that the center is defined by whatever the cross represents.</v>

10
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.140
<v Speaker 1>Now the cross represents a crossing point.</v>

11
00:00:40.141 --> 00:00:40.921
<v Speaker 1>Geographically,</v>

12
00:00:40.921 --> 00:00:41.191
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

13
00:00:41.191 --> 00:00:45.300
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly that the cross probably represents the body to some degree,</v>

14
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.070
<v Speaker 1>but then the cross also represents the place of suffering obviously.</v>

15
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.630
<v Speaker 1>And more importantly it,</v>

16
00:00:51.631 --> 00:00:54.330
<v Speaker 1>it represents the place of voluntary suffering.</v>

17
00:00:54.331 --> 00:00:55.440
<v Speaker 1>Transcended.</v>

18
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm speaking psychologically,</v>

19
00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:58.170
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

20
00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.340
<v Speaker 1>Not Theologically.</v>

21
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.870
<v Speaker 1>That's what it represents.</v>

22
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.340
<v Speaker 1>And so you might say,</v>

23
00:01:02.341 --> 00:01:07.320
<v Speaker 1>so here's the idea behind putting down the obelisk with the cross and saying</v>

24
00:01:07.321 --> 00:01:08.370
<v Speaker 1>that that's the center.</v>

25
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.890
<v Speaker 1>So that's the thing that everyone's aiming at.</v>

26
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:11.580
<v Speaker 1>And so the I,</v>

27
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.600
<v Speaker 1>the idea would be,</v>

28
00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:12.811
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

29
00:01:12.811 --> 00:01:16.290
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to be a member of the group defined by this obelisk,</v>

30
00:01:16.291 --> 00:01:21.291
<v Speaker 1>then what you do is accept your position at the center of suffering voluntarily</v>

31
00:01:21.961 --> 00:01:23.930
<v Speaker 1>and therefore transcend it.</v>

32
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.230
<v Speaker 1>That's the idea.</v>

33
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.630
<v Speaker 1>And that is one hell of an idea.</v>

34
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.650
<v Speaker 1>It really is,</v>

35
00:01:28.651 --> 00:01:28.921
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

36
00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:32.580
<v Speaker 1>that is a killer idea because it's actually a signal.</v>

37
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.490
<v Speaker 1>It's a really clear signal of psychological health.</v>

38
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:36.181
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

39
00:01:36.181 --> 00:01:39.360
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things you do if you're a clinical psychologist and someone</v>

40
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.040
<v Speaker 1>is paralyzed by fear is what you do is you break their fears down into</v>

41
00:01:44.041 --> 00:01:46.230
<v Speaker 1>relatively manageable bits,</v>

42
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.040
<v Speaker 1>and then you have the voluntarily confront their fears.</v>

43
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.340
<v Speaker 1>And it might also be things that they're disgusted by it say if they have</v>

44
00:01:53.341 --> 00:01:54.750
<v Speaker 1>obsessive compulsive disorder,</v>

45
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.210
<v Speaker 1>but it produces very strong negative emotion,</v>

46
00:01:57.211 --> 00:01:58.044
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>

47
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.010
<v Speaker 1>And then you have them voluntarily confront whatever it is that produces that</v>

48
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.910
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming negative emotion and that makes them stronger.</v>

49
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.200
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens.</v>

50
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.450
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make them less afraid.</v>

51
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.780
<v Speaker 1>It makes them more courageous and stronger.</v>

52
00:02:12.781 --> 00:02:14.040
<v Speaker 1>And that is not the same thing.</v>

53
00:02:14.041 --> 00:02:15.000
<v Speaker 1>It's seriously not.</v>

54
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:16.740
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't decrease the fear.</v>

55
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.600
<v Speaker 1>It increases the courage.</v>

56
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.340
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a mind boggling idea and it's deeper.</v>

57
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

58
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.090
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's really interesting about these archetypal ideas is</v>

59
00:02:27.091 --> 00:02:27.500
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

60
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.540
<v Speaker 1>and maybe it's partly because of the hyperlink nature of the Bible,</v>

61
00:02:30.541 --> 00:02:31.291
<v Speaker 1>that's part of it,</v>

62
00:02:31.291 --> 00:02:32.250
<v Speaker 1>but it's not,</v>

63
00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:34.830
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing is that no matter how deep you dig into them,</v>

64
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.420
<v Speaker 1>you'll never get to the bottom.</v>

65
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:37.051
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

66
00:02:37.051 --> 00:02:37.890
<v Speaker 1>you hit a bottom,</v>

67
00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:38.251
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

68
00:02:38.251 --> 00:02:38.611
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

69
00:02:38.611 --> 00:02:40.470
<v Speaker 1>that's so unbelievably profound.</v>

70
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.690
<v Speaker 1>And then if you excavate a little underneath that,</v>

71
00:02:42.691 --> 00:02:45.240
<v Speaker 1>you find something else that's even more profound and you think,</v>

72
00:02:45.241 --> 00:02:45.631
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

73
00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:46.830
<v Speaker 1>that's gotta be the bottom.</v>

74
00:02:46.831 --> 00:02:48.090
<v Speaker 1>And then you dig under that.</v>

75
00:02:48.091 --> 00:02:49.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's no bottom.</v>

76
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.410
<v Speaker 1>You can just keep digging down while as far as I can tell,</v>

77
00:02:52.411 --> 00:02:54.660
<v Speaker 1>you can keep digging down layer after layer.</v>

78
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.730
<v Speaker 1>And we'll talk a little bit about more,</v>

79
00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.880
<v Speaker 1>a little more about what the cross signifies as the center,</v>

80
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.800
<v Speaker 1>because you see what people were trying to figure out is what is it that we need</v>

81
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:07.240
<v Speaker 1>to unite under,</v>

82
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.541
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

83
00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:09.580
<v Speaker 1>What's the proper thing to unite under?</v>

84
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:10.990
<v Speaker 1>I can give you another example.</v>

85
00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:13.360
<v Speaker 1>So in the Mesopotamian societies,</v>

86
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.040
<v Speaker 1>the emperor</v>

87
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.480
<v Speaker 1>who was more or less than an absolute monarch,</v>

88
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.050
<v Speaker 1>he lived inside what was essentially a walled city.</v>

89
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.190
<v Speaker 1>And the god of the Mesopotamians was Martik.</v>

90
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.360
<v Speaker 1>And martech was the figure who had eyes all the way around his head.</v>

91
00:03:31.361 --> 00:03:32.470
<v Speaker 1>And he spoke magic words.</v>

92
00:03:32.471 --> 00:03:34.540
<v Speaker 1>So it was very attentive and very articulate,</v>

93
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.010
<v Speaker 1>and it was mark who went out and confronted the goddess of chaos,</v>

94
00:03:39.011 --> 00:03:42.370
<v Speaker 1>the dragon of chaos and cutter into pieces and made up the world.</v>

95
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.881
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

96
00:03:42.881 --> 00:03:44.920
<v Speaker 1>So you can kind of understand what that means.</v>

97
00:03:44.921 --> 00:03:49.921
<v Speaker 1>So Marta goes beyond the frontier into the place of predatory chaos and</v>

98
00:03:51.971 --> 00:03:56.470
<v Speaker 1>encounters the thing that's terrifying and then make something productive out of</v>

99
00:03:56.471 --> 00:03:56.950
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

100
00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.030
<v Speaker 1>So it's a hero myth.</v>

101
00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.930
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

102
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.770
<v Speaker 1>and Martech is elected to the position of preeminent God by all the other</v>

103
00:04:02.771 --> 00:04:05.050
<v Speaker 1>Mesopotamian gods because he manages that.</v>

104
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.850
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

105
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.680
<v Speaker 1>the Martech idea emerges up the holy</v>

106
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.100
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy and hits the Pinnacle and God only knows how long that took.</v>

107
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.530
<v Speaker 1>It would be the amalgamation of many tribes.</v>

108
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:18.603
<v Speaker 1>And then the,</v>

109
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.470
<v Speaker 1>the what?</v>

110
00:04:20.471 --> 00:04:21.304
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

111
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:27.080
<v Speaker 1>the distillation of all the tribal myths to produce this emergent story of what</v>

112
00:04:27.191 --> 00:04:28.750
<v Speaker 1>constitutes top God.</v>

113
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.870
<v Speaker 1>And then the job of the emperor was to act out Marduk.</v>

114
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.730
<v Speaker 1>That's what gave him sovereignty.</v>

115
00:04:33.731 --> 00:04:38.170
<v Speaker 1>So the reason that he was the center around which people organize themselves</v>

116
00:04:38.171 --> 00:04:41.170
<v Speaker 1>wasn't because he was when he was being a proper emperor,</v>

117
00:04:41.171 --> 00:04:43.840
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't because there was something super special about him,</v>

118
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.450
<v Speaker 1>like the power didn't exactly reside in him,</v>

119
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.790
<v Speaker 1>which is a really useful thing to separate.</v>

120
00:04:48.791 --> 00:04:48.971
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

121
00:04:48.971 --> 00:04:50.020
<v Speaker 1>You want the power,</v>

122
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.680
<v Speaker 1>which is why it's kind of Nice to have a symbolic monarch.</v>

123
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.730
<v Speaker 1>You get the symbolic power separated from the personality power,</v>

124
00:04:57.731 --> 00:04:57.941
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

125
00:04:57.941 --> 00:04:59.440
<v Speaker 1>Cause otherwise they get conflated.</v>

126
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:00.760
<v Speaker 1>That's what happened in Rome.</v>

127
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.511
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>

128
00:05:01.511 --> 00:05:01.790
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>

129
00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.350
<v Speaker 1>and you can see it tending to happen now and then in the u s like with the</v>

130
00:05:05.351 --> 00:05:07.240
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy dynasties and that sort of thing.</v>

131
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.720
<v Speaker 1>So the idea was the emperor had sovereignty as long as he was acting out Marta</v>

132
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.590
<v Speaker 1>properly and going out into the chaos and cutting it into pieces and making</v>

133
00:05:17.591 --> 00:05:18.220
<v Speaker 1>order.</v>

134
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.090
<v Speaker 1>That was his job they used to take about outside the city on the New Year's</v>

135
00:05:22.091 --> 00:05:27.091
<v Speaker 1>festival and strip him of all his emperor garments and humiliate them and then</v>

136
00:05:27.611 --> 00:05:28.630
<v Speaker 1>force him to,</v>

137
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.770
<v Speaker 1>to confess all the ways that year he hadn't been a good Martech,</v>

138
00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.180
<v Speaker 1>so he wasn't a good ruler.</v>

139
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.820
<v Speaker 1>And so that was supposed to clue him in and wake him up.</v>

140
00:05:39.821 --> 00:05:40.510
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

141
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:45.510
<v Speaker 1>And then they would ritually reenact the battle of Martech against tie timeout</v>

142
00:05:46.301 --> 00:05:48.640
<v Speaker 1>out the chaos monster using statues.</v>

143
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.040
<v Speaker 1>And then if that all went well,</v>

144
00:05:51.041 --> 00:05:55.240
<v Speaker 1>then the emperor would go back in and the city would be renewed for another</v>

145
00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.241
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

146
00:05:55.241 --> 00:05:57.950
<v Speaker 1>And we still have echoes of that in our New Year's celebration.</v>

147
00:05:57.951 --> 00:06:00.290
<v Speaker 1>Writes the same idea that's echoed down all those,</v>

148
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.910
<v Speaker 1>all those centuries,</v>

149
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:02.990
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years.</v>

150
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.230
<v Speaker 1>So it says such a staggeringly brilliant idea,</v>

151
00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:06.441
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

152
00:06:06.441 --> 00:06:10.250
<v Speaker 1>Because so part of the idea is that the thing that sovereign,</v>

153
00:06:10.251 --> 00:06:12.170
<v Speaker 1>so that's the pillar at the center that,</v>

154
00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:17.090
<v Speaker 1>that everyone gathers around is at least in part the thing that courageously</v>

155
00:06:17.091 --> 00:06:21.920
<v Speaker 1>goes out into the unknown and make something useful out of it for the community.</v>

156
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:23.593
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

157
00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:26.481
<v Speaker 1>that's very,</v>

158
00:06:26.481 --> 00:06:27.314
<v Speaker 1>very smart.</v>

159
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:28.520
<v Speaker 1>It's very smart.</v>

160
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.850
<v Speaker 1>So this is another example of a center.</v>

161
00:06:31.851 --> 00:06:32.361
<v Speaker 1>So these,</v>

162
00:06:32.361 --> 00:06:33.260
<v Speaker 1>this is the flag,</v>

163
00:06:33.261 --> 00:06:34.460
<v Speaker 1>this is the Union Jack.</v>

164
00:06:34.461 --> 00:06:37.310
<v Speaker 1>And so it's made up of a bunch of crosses,</v>

165
00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:37.791
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

166
00:06:37.791 --> 00:06:39.080
<v Speaker 1>And so the first cross,</v>

167
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.550
<v Speaker 1>the English cross,</v>

168
00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:41.990
<v Speaker 1>that's the flag of Saint George.</v>

169
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:43.010
<v Speaker 1>That's the flag of England.</v>

170
00:06:43.011 --> 00:06:43.430
<v Speaker 1>And say,</v>

171
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:44.610
<v Speaker 1>what does Saint George do?</v>

172
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.300
<v Speaker 1>Slays the Dragon.</v>

173
00:06:47.301 --> 00:06:47.841
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

174
00:06:47.841 --> 00:06:48.621
<v Speaker 1>Same idea,</v>

175
00:06:48.621 --> 00:06:48.891
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

176
00:06:48.891 --> 00:06:49.850
<v Speaker 1>So St George,</v>

177
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.480
<v Speaker 1>patron saint of England goes out and slays the dragon and freeze the virgin from</v>

178
00:06:53.481 --> 00:06:54.620
<v Speaker 1>the grip of the Dragon.</v>

179
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:55.850
<v Speaker 1>Same idea,</v>

180
00:06:55.851 --> 00:06:56.061
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

181
00:06:56.061 --> 00:06:57.140
<v Speaker 1>So that's the center.</v>

182
00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.880
<v Speaker 1>And then the second cross is called,</v>

183
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:01.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

184
00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:02.540
<v Speaker 1>a Saltier,</v>

185
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.190
<v Speaker 1>but it's another crucifix.</v>

186
00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.520
<v Speaker 1>So it's the cross on which Saint Andrew was crucified.</v>

187
00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.290
<v Speaker 1>So it's the same idea.</v>

188
00:07:09.291 --> 00:07:14.291
<v Speaker 1>It's that the center is the center of suffering voluntarily undertaken because</v>

189
00:07:14.371 --> 00:07:15.710
<v Speaker 1>Saint Andrew was a martyr.</v>

190
00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.470
<v Speaker 1>And then Saint Patrick is the third cross.</v>

191
00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.390
<v Speaker 1>And what did Saint Patrick do in Ireland?</v>

192
00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:23.330
<v Speaker 1>Chased out all the snakes,</v>

193
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:24.201
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

194
00:07:24.201 --> 00:07:25.790
<v Speaker 1>So it's the same thing,</v>

195
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:26.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

196
00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:30.590
<v Speaker 1>And so the flag of Great Britain is the combination of all of these three</v>

197
00:07:30.591 --> 00:07:32.540
<v Speaker 1>crosses that defines the center.</v>

198
00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:34.040
<v Speaker 1>And that's what the flag is.</v>

199
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:36.260
<v Speaker 1>So that symbolizes all of that.</v>

200
00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:38.720
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

201
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:39.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

202
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.520
<v Speaker 1>completely mind boggling.</v>

203
00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:44.450
<v Speaker 1>So when there's more about Saint Patrick too,</v>

204
00:07:44.451 --> 00:07:47.450
<v Speaker 1>so he banishes the snakes after a 40 day fast.</v>

205
00:07:47.451 --> 00:07:51.950
<v Speaker 1>And so that's an illusion to the 40 years that Moses spends in the desert.</v>

206
00:07:51.951 --> 00:07:56.951
<v Speaker 1>And also the 40 days that Christ fast in the New Testament and his walking stick</v>

207
00:07:57.171 --> 00:07:59.240
<v Speaker 1>when he plants it grows into a tree.</v>

208
00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:03.530
<v Speaker 1>So that echos all of the ideas about the center that we just described.</v>

209
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:07.280
<v Speaker 1>And he also speaks with the ancient Irish ancestors,</v>

210
00:08:07.281 --> 00:08:08.630
<v Speaker 1>which if you remember,</v>

211
00:08:08.631 --> 00:08:13.631
<v Speaker 1>is a characteristic of the shamanic rituals where we're so in the typical</v>

212
00:08:14.391 --> 00:08:15.320
<v Speaker 1>shamonic ritual,</v>

213
00:08:15.321 --> 00:08:20.321
<v Speaker 1>which seems to be elicited by psychedelic use,</v>

214
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:25.660
<v Speaker 1>the Sharman dissolve down past their bones and then they go up into heaven and</v>

215
00:08:26.451 --> 00:08:27.830
<v Speaker 1>speak with the ancestors,</v>

216
00:08:27.831 --> 00:08:32.831
<v Speaker 1>and then they're introduced into the heavenly kingdom and then the flash is put</v>

217
00:08:33.141 --> 00:08:36.470
<v Speaker 1>back on their bones and they come back and tell everybody what happened.</v>

218
00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:39.590
<v Speaker 1>And that's a repeatable experience,</v>

219
00:08:39.591 --> 00:08:39.861
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

220
00:08:39.861 --> 00:08:43.580
<v Speaker 1>The shamanic tradition is unbelievably widespread.</v>

221
00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:46.070
<v Speaker 1>So all over Europe,</v>

222
00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:47.390
<v Speaker 1>ancient Europe and Asia,</v>

223
00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.850
<v Speaker 1>and perhaps as far down as South America,</v>

224
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:50.151
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

225
00:08:50.151 --> 00:08:51.710
<v Speaker 1>It's highly conserved.</v>

226
00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:56.030
<v Speaker 1>And it's out of that tradition in all likelihood that our religious idiation</v>

227
00:08:56.031 --> 00:08:56.864
<v Speaker 1>emerged.</v>

228
00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:57.681
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

229
00:08:57.681 --> 00:08:59.570
<v Speaker 1>and you can see echoes of that here.</v>
