1
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:00.751
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2
00:00:00.751 --> 00:00:03.930
<v Speaker 1>the a book's subtitle is the case or reasons,</v>

3
00:00:03.931 --> 00:00:04.531
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>

4
00:00:04.531 --> 00:00:07.230
<v Speaker 1>humanism and progress at all.</v>

5
00:00:07.231 --> 00:00:07.910
<v Speaker 1>I'll begin with the,</v>

6
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.870
<v Speaker 1>with the progress because that was the epiphany that more than anything inspired</v>

7
00:00:12.871 --> 00:00:13.590
<v Speaker 1>the book.</v>

8
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.790
<v Speaker 1>I'd written a previous book,</v>

9
00:00:14.791 --> 00:00:18.990
<v Speaker 1>the better angels of our nature when I was surprised to come across data sets</v>

10
00:00:18.991 --> 00:00:23.220
<v Speaker 1>showing that many measures of violence it declined over the course of history.</v>

11
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.700
<v Speaker 1>I was stunned to see a graph that showed the rates of homicide from England and</v>

12
00:00:28.981 --> 00:00:33.180
<v Speaker 1>other western European countries from the 13 hundreds to the 20th century</v>

13
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.360
<v Speaker 1>showing a decline of anywhere from 35 to 50 in the chances of a,</v>

14
00:00:39.031 --> 00:00:39.864
<v Speaker 1>of getting murdered.</v>

15
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.741
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

16
00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:41.670
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>

17
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.343
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.510
<v Speaker 1>called attention to this fact and a blog post,</v>

19
00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:50.160
<v Speaker 1>I didn't got correspondence from historians from international relations</v>

20
00:00:50.161 --> 00:00:50.731
<v Speaker 1>scholars,</v>

21
00:00:50.731 --> 00:00:51.990
<v Speaker 1>from sociologists say,</v>

22
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.351
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:00:52.351 --> 00:00:53.970
<v Speaker 1>you could have mentioned other declines,</v>

24
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.440
<v Speaker 1>another decline of violence.</v>

25
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.490
<v Speaker 1>And one worst scholar showed me that the rate of death and war had plummeted.</v>

26
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.640
<v Speaker 1>Another showed me that rates of domestic violence have gone down still another</v>

27
00:01:06.631 --> 00:01:09.000
<v Speaker 1>that rates of child abuse had gone down.</v>

28
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.750
<v Speaker 1>And I realized that the time that there was an important story here that was,</v>

29
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

30
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.130
<v Speaker 1>that it had to be told that these different declines of violence ought to be</v>

31
00:01:17.131 --> 00:01:20.160
<v Speaker 1>presented to the world in between a single pair of covers.</v>

32
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.940
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

33
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.220
<v Speaker 1>just because it did seem to be something of a pattern.</v>

34
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.730
<v Speaker 1>And as a psychologist it opened up the challenge of how to explain it.</v>

35
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.211
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

36
00:01:27.211 --> 00:01:28.800
<v Speaker 1>how to explain the,</v>

37
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:29.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

38
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.180
<v Speaker 1>the fact that there's been,</v>

39
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.730
<v Speaker 1>that there is so much violence in human affairs,</v>

40
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.100
<v Speaker 1>but also the fact that it can be brought down.</v>

41
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

42
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.490
<v Speaker 1>I had a similar set of epiphany's that led to the writing of enlightenment.</v>

43
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.390
<v Speaker 1>Now when,</v>

44
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.691
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

45
00:01:39.691 --> 00:01:41.610
<v Speaker 1>after better angels was published,</v>

46
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:42.540
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

47
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.230
<v Speaker 1>I started a couple of cross data showing that other aspects of human wellbeing</v>

48
00:01:46.231 --> 00:01:47.064
<v Speaker 1>had improved.</v>

49
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.310
<v Speaker 1>The rate of extreme poverty had plummeted by but 50% just in three decades and</v>

50
00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:54.780
<v Speaker 1>now stands less than 10%.</v>

51
00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.230
<v Speaker 1>Life expectancy has been increasing all over the world,</v>

52
00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.213
<v Speaker 1>including the,</v>

53
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:00.600
<v Speaker 1>the poorest parts of the world.</v>

54
00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.043
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

55
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.760
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

56
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.740
<v Speaker 1>the number of kids going to school has increased.</v>

57
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.941
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

58
00:02:04.941 --> 00:02:05.671
<v Speaker 1>including girls,</v>

59
00:02:05.671 --> 00:02:10.280
<v Speaker 1>more than 90% of people under the age of 25 on the planet are illiterate.</v>

60
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.270
<v Speaker 1>Now we have more leisure time.</v>

61
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.133
<v Speaker 1>We're safer,</v>

62
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.651
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

63
00:02:13.651 --> 00:02:16.290
<v Speaker 1>in measure after measure life has been getting better.</v>

64
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.350
<v Speaker 1>And it's not the kind of development that you could learn about reading the</v>

65
00:02:21.451 --> 00:02:21.841
<v Speaker 1>papers.</v>

66
00:02:21.841 --> 00:02:26.610
<v Speaker 1>Quite the contrary because journalism covers what goes wrong.</v>

67
00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:27.180
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

68
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.350
<v Speaker 1>not what goes right.</v>

69
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.350
<v Speaker 1>You could easily come away with the impression that the world is getting worse</v>

70
00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:34.380
<v Speaker 1>and worse as a kind of statistical illusion,</v>

71
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

72
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.310
<v Speaker 1>feeding a cognitive bias and not realize until you looked at datasets,</v>

73
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.320
<v Speaker 1>how many ways in which life has improved,</v>

74
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.630
<v Speaker 1>including measures like war and crime,</v>

75
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.231
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

76
00:02:46.231 --> 00:02:47.064
<v Speaker 1>which would,</v>

77
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.300
<v Speaker 1>what my guests are going in the wrong direction as opposed to the right</v>

78
00:02:51.301 --> 00:02:52.134
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>

79
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.030
<v Speaker 1>That combined that the other motivation for the book was a set of attacks on the</v>

80
00:02:57.031 --> 00:03:02.031
<v Speaker 1>application of science to the traditional domains of the humanities to,</v>

81
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.980
<v Speaker 1>to history,</v>

82
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.510
<v Speaker 1>to the arts,</v>

83
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.120
<v Speaker 1>to morality,</v>

84
00:03:07.121 --> 00:03:07.990
<v Speaker 1>to language.</v>

85
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.070
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

86
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.341
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

87
00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:09.521
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

88
00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:13.380
<v Speaker 1>an effort that I think is quite a celebrates the fact that,</v>

89
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.670
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

90
00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.270
<v Speaker 1>that scientific insights are being brought to bear on,</v>

91
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:17.223
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

92
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.340
<v Speaker 1>on Cuban affairs.</v>

93
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.020
<v Speaker 1>And how could they not give him that,</v>

94
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.891
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

95
00:03:20.891 --> 00:03:25.240
<v Speaker 1>art in society or are in a sense products of our,</v>

96
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.250
<v Speaker 1>our psychology products of human nature.</v>

97
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.020
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

98
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

99
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.950
<v Speaker 1>in a lot of the intellectual life,</v>

100
00:03:29.951 --> 00:03:34.951
<v Speaker 1>there's bitter resentment to any application of scientific ideas or the</v>

101
00:03:35.351 --> 00:03:37.300
<v Speaker 1>scientific mindset to,</v>

102
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.380
<v Speaker 1>to human affairs.</v>

103
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.960
<v Speaker 1>This was first noted by CP snow in his famous lectures and [inaudible] and the</v>

104
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:43.570
<v Speaker 1>early,</v>

105
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:44.200
<v Speaker 1>late fifties,</v>

106
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.340
<v Speaker 1>early 1960s.</v>

107
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:46.091
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

108
00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:48.880
<v Speaker 1>but the conflict is very much with us.</v>

109
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.580
<v Speaker 1>I wrote an essay called science is not your enemy,</v>

110
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.710
<v Speaker 1>which were published in the new Republican,</v>

111
00:03:53.711 --> 00:03:54.700
<v Speaker 1>which went viral.</v>

112
00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.410
<v Speaker 1>And that was the immediate,</v>

113
00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.670
<v Speaker 1>a kickoff for the proposal that ended up in the enlightenment.</v>

114
00:04:00.671 --> 00:04:01.280
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

115
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

116
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.860
<v Speaker 1>I was involved in something of a literary spat with,</v>

117
00:04:05.861 --> 00:04:06.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

118
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.780
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

119
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

120
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.040
<v Speaker 1>Leon Wieseltier and editor at the new republic.</v>

121
00:04:09.041 --> 00:04:10.390
<v Speaker 1>But I quickly realized that,</v>

122
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:11.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

123
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.370
<v Speaker 1>two guys having an argument is not enough to pump out a book.</v>

124
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.790
<v Speaker 1>And so I had the centerpiece of the book just be the documentation of the fact</v>

125
00:04:22.211 --> 00:04:25.120
<v Speaker 1>that most people are unaware of namely back in most measures,</v>

126
00:04:25.121 --> 00:04:26.530
<v Speaker 1>life has gotten better over time.</v>

127
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.580
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

128
00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.410
<v Speaker 1>as with the better angels of our nature,</v>

129
00:04:29.411 --> 00:04:32.810
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to just present a bunch of graphs.</v>

130
00:04:32.811 --> 00:04:34.300
<v Speaker 1>So I did present many graphs,</v>

131
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.560
<v Speaker 1>but I wanted to explain them.</v>

132
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:36.910
<v Speaker 1>And it seemed to me that if we,</v>

133
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.860
<v Speaker 1>if there was any overarching explanation as to why life get better,</v>

134
00:04:41.861 --> 00:04:42.910
<v Speaker 1>it's that people,</v>

135
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

136
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.540
<v Speaker 1>in the past thought that by understanding how the world works,</v>

137
00:04:46.541 --> 00:04:47.620
<v Speaker 1>including ourselves,</v>

138
00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.401
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

139
00:04:48.401 --> 00:04:49.990
<v Speaker 1>we could try to solve problems,</v>

140
00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:51.880
<v Speaker 1>remember what works,</v>

141
00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

142
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

143
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.531
<v Speaker 1>drop the,</v>

144
00:04:53.531 --> 00:04:54.550
<v Speaker 1>drop the failures.</v>

145
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.150
<v Speaker 1>And as we accumulate our,</v>

146
00:04:56.151 --> 00:04:57.490
<v Speaker 1>our cultural knowledge,</v>

147
00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:58.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

148
00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.190
<v Speaker 1>we can improve our wellbeing.</v>

149
00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.930
<v Speaker 1>And I attribute that mindset to the light,</v>

150
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.760
<v Speaker 1>the idea that we can use knowledge to improve human wellbeing.</v>

151
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.150
<v Speaker 1>Now that might sound almost too banal and that tried to be worth defending.</v>

152
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:18.310
<v Speaker 1>And so I thought that those ideals very much needed a defense.</v>
