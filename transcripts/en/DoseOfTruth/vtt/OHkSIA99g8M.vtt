00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:07.060
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

2
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:07.890
<v Speaker 1>Lauren asks,</v>

3
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.220
<v Speaker 1>I would love to hear you do a lecture series on raising children properly.</v>

4
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.870
<v Speaker 1>Is that something you would consider?</v>

5
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:13.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:14.940
<v Speaker 1>in my new book,</v>

7
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.310
<v Speaker 1>I've written a chapter on that called don't let your children do anything that</v>

8
00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:21.480
<v Speaker 1>makes you dislike them.</v>

9
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.880
<v Speaker 1>And I've laid out a bunch of,</v>

10
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:24.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.520
<v Speaker 1>I've laid out a philosophy of care and discipline that's predicated partly on a</v>

12
00:00:31.561 --> 00:00:34.260
<v Speaker 1>French philosophical legal notion,</v>

13
00:00:34.261 --> 00:00:38.310
<v Speaker 1>which is do not multiply rules beyond necessity.</v>

14
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.330
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of like illegal equivalent to all comes razor and an English common</v>

15
00:00:42.331 --> 00:00:46.050
<v Speaker 1>law principle is which is used minimal necessary force.</v>

16
00:00:46.051 --> 00:00:47.940
<v Speaker 1>And I think the Union of those two,</v>

17
00:00:47.941 --> 00:00:49.860
<v Speaker 1>which is don't have too many rules,</v>

18
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.330
<v Speaker 1>but make sure that you properly enforced the ones that you do have is a good</v>

19
00:00:54.331 --> 00:00:58.950
<v Speaker 1>start for how you might consider your attitude with regards to raising children.</v>

20
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.370
<v Speaker 1>The other thing you have to figure out is exactly what's your aim.</v>

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.680
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

22
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.030
<v Speaker 1>one of the aims that people have had most recently pushed by clueless</v>

23
00:01:09.031 --> 00:01:09.781
<v Speaker 1>psychologists,</v>

24
00:01:09.781 --> 00:01:10.321
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

25
00:01:10.321 --> 00:01:12.780
<v Speaker 1>is that you want children to have high self esteem.</v>

26
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.063
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

27
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.460
<v Speaker 1>that's actually a large part trait.</v>

28
00:01:17.461 --> 00:01:18.720
<v Speaker 1>Neuroticism anyways,</v>

29
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.041
<v Speaker 1>but by,</v>

30
00:01:20.041 --> 00:01:21.690
<v Speaker 1>and it can be modified to some degree.</v>

31
00:01:21.691 --> 00:01:24.480
<v Speaker 1>Jerome Kagan has done some very interesting work on that.</v>

32
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.673
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

33
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.903
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

34
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.760
<v Speaker 1>the best thing to do,</v>

35
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.870
<v Speaker 1>I think the best thing to orient yourself towards with regards to children is</v>

36
00:01:36.871 --> 00:01:39.660
<v Speaker 1>that you're trying to make your child,</v>

37
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.640
<v Speaker 1>your children or help your children to be delightful in the eyes of others.</v>

38
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.330
<v Speaker 1>And so that means they have to be reasonably well socialized.</v>

39
00:01:48.331 --> 00:01:50.820
<v Speaker 1>And that really takes place between the ages of two and four.</v>

40
00:01:50.821 --> 00:01:54.420
<v Speaker 1>Because what you want for your children is that when they go out into public,</v>

41
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.510
<v Speaker 1>when they're away from you or even with you for that matter,</v>

42
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.190
<v Speaker 1>what you want for your children is for other people to genuinely like them.</v>

43
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.110
<v Speaker 1>Because if they behave reasonably and they attend properly to adults and they</v>

44
00:02:07.111 --> 00:02:08.490
<v Speaker 1>know how to play with other children,</v>

45
00:02:08.491 --> 00:02:10.140
<v Speaker 1>then wherever they go,</v>

46
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.280
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be,</v>

47
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:12.630
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

48
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.870
<v Speaker 1>unless they encountered someone truly malevolent,</v>

49
00:02:15.871 --> 00:02:18.360
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be welcomed with smiles and open arms.</v>

50
00:02:18.361 --> 00:02:22.950
<v Speaker 1>And that's not going to be fake because almost every human being actually likes</v>

51
00:02:22.951 --> 00:02:26.310
<v Speaker 1>children if they're reasonably behaved.</v>

52
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.500
<v Speaker 1>And so your job is to make your children highly socially desirable because that</v>

53
00:02:31.501 --> 00:02:32.670
<v Speaker 1>opens up the world to them.</v>

54
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.780
<v Speaker 1>So they're,</v>

55
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.730
<v Speaker 1>that's not a lecture series,</v>

56
00:02:35.731 --> 00:02:37.350
<v Speaker 1>but it's a little lecture.</v>
