1
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.720
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you a couple more personal questions,</v>

2
00:00:09.721 --> 00:00:10.554
<v Speaker 1>if you don't mind.</v>

3
00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:11.803
<v Speaker 1>You mentioned</v>

4
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.260
<v Speaker 1>briefly during our,</v>

5
00:00:14.261 --> 00:00:15.860
<v Speaker 1>during our conversation that you know,</v>

6
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.280
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

7
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:16.610
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

8
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:17.220
<v Speaker 1>you were,</v>

9
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.150
<v Speaker 1>you're from a pretty fundamentalist Christian background and you became a</v>

10
00:00:21.151 --> 00:00:22.970
<v Speaker 1>skeptic and you'd be pursuing that with,</v>

11
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:23.730
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

12
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.740
<v Speaker 1>with well adamantly,</v>

13
00:00:25.741 --> 00:00:27.180
<v Speaker 1>let's say for a very long time.</v>

14
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.800
<v Speaker 1>So two questions is</v>

15
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.600
<v Speaker 1>what put you on that path and what do you think your positive function as a</v>

16
00:00:35.671 --> 00:00:36.840
<v Speaker 1>skeptic is?</v>

17
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

18
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.440
<v Speaker 2>so first of all,</v>

19
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.350
<v Speaker 2>my family wasn't religious at all.</v>

20
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.900
<v Speaker 2>They weren't antireligious to just wasn't a thing.</v>

21
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.130
<v Speaker 2>I became interested in it and the early seventies when I was in high school,</v>

22
00:00:48.131 --> 00:00:52.450
<v Speaker 2>which was sort of the early development of the Evangelical Movement in the</v>

23
00:00:52.451 --> 00:00:53.284
<v Speaker 2>United States.</v>

24
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:54.820
<v Speaker 2>So I called born again movement,</v>

25
00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:57.310
<v Speaker 2>and there was no affiliation with any church or particular,</v>

26
00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.300
<v Speaker 2>we all recognize that,</v>

27
00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

28
00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.120
<v Speaker 2>organized religion was probably not all that great.</v>

29
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.610
<v Speaker 2>So just sort of a one on one,</v>

30
00:01:03.611 --> 00:01:05.350
<v Speaker 2>it's just you and Jesus and the Bible,</v>

31
00:01:05.351 --> 00:01:06.400
<v Speaker 2>you and God and so on.</v>

32
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.451
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

33
00:01:07.451 --> 00:01:08.560
<v Speaker 2>that was that whole,</v>

34
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

35
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.241
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>

36
00:01:10.241 --> 00:01:11.920
<v Speaker 2>superstar time and all that.</v>

37
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.851
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

38
00:01:12.851 --> 00:01:17.530
<v Speaker 2>but I took it very seriously and I went to Pepperdine and I took courses in the</v>

39
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:18.281
<v Speaker 2>Old Testament and New Testament.</v>

40
00:01:18.281 --> 00:01:21.820
<v Speaker 2>I read everything cs Lewis wrote to the course in the writings of Cs Lewis said</v>

41
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.290
<v Speaker 2>I was into it then.</v>

42
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:24.360
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

43
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.880
<v Speaker 2>at Pepperdine,</v>

44
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.540
<v Speaker 2>you're in the bubble of the Christian worldview.</v>

45
00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.610
<v Speaker 2>This totally consistent.</v>

46
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.230
<v Speaker 2>It's internally coherent,</v>

47
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.891
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

48
00:01:32.891 --> 00:01:34.150
<v Speaker 2>until you're outside the bubble.</v>

49
00:01:34.151 --> 00:01:39.100
<v Speaker 2>So when I went to a secular university and to study experimental psychology,</v>

50
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:40.503
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

51
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.710
<v Speaker 2>not only was that more of a grounding in the scientific method of understanding</v>

52
00:01:44.711 --> 00:01:45.131
<v Speaker 2>reality,</v>

53
00:01:45.131 --> 00:01:45.881
<v Speaker 2>but just for fun.</v>

54
00:01:45.881 --> 00:01:46.900
<v Speaker 2>I took courses in,</v>

55
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.411
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

56
00:01:47.411 --> 00:01:48.880
<v Speaker 2>I took courses in evolutionary theory.</v>

57
00:01:48.881 --> 00:01:50.050
<v Speaker 2>I was kind of a creationist.</v>

58
00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.580
<v Speaker 2>I remember sitting there thinking,</v>

59
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.211
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

60
00:01:52.211 --> 00:01:53.350
<v Speaker 2>this stuff is real.</v>

61
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.933
<v Speaker 2>There's an actual site.</v>

62
00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.190
<v Speaker 2>But then I took a course in,</v>

63
00:01:57.191 --> 00:01:57.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

64
00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:58.480
<v Speaker 2>and mythology,</v>

65
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.080
<v Speaker 2>anthropology and comparative mythology and that kind of opened up my eyes.</v>

66
00:02:02.081 --> 00:02:06.520
<v Speaker 2>So I sort of went through my Joseph Campbell stage and the myth of the hero,</v>

67
00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.530
<v Speaker 2>I read the hero of a thousand faces and all that.</v>

68
00:02:08.531 --> 00:02:08.741
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

69
00:02:08.741 --> 00:02:09.011
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

70
00:02:09.011 --> 00:02:09.844
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

71
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.990
<v Speaker 2>this is a different way of looking at things than the pure scientific way.</v>

72
00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.870
<v Speaker 2>But it's also different from a lot of these religious traditions,</v>

73
00:02:16.871 --> 00:02:17.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

74
00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.100
<v Speaker 2>so that,</v>

75
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.460
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of told me that the particular religion I was in,</v>

76
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.310
<v Speaker 2>it's wrong to ask,</v>

77
00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:24.640
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>

78
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.660
<v Speaker 2>is it right or wrong?</v>

79
00:02:25.661 --> 00:02:26.140
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

80
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.560
<v Speaker 2>it's a completely different thing.</v>

81
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.740
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

82
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:28.573
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>

83
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.030
<v Speaker 2>it just wasn't working for me anymore.</v>

84
00:02:31.031 --> 00:02:31.630
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

85
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.270
<v Speaker 2>and I enjoyed the scientific way of thinking about the world and I was</v>

86
00:02:34.271 --> 00:02:38.440
<v Speaker 2>surrounded by people that it's not that they were atheists in graduate school</v>

87
00:02:38.441 --> 00:02:39.940
<v Speaker 2>and after that it's like,</v>

88
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.040
<v Speaker 2>remember this is now the late seventies.</v>

89
00:02:42.041 --> 00:02:47.041
<v Speaker 2>And then when I went to graduate school in the second time for my phd and his of</v>

90
00:02:47.051 --> 00:02:48.070
<v Speaker 2>science and late eighties,</v>

91
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.473
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

92
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.841
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

93
00:02:49.841 --> 00:02:50.770
<v Speaker 2>the whole eighth science,</v>

94
00:02:50.771 --> 00:02:51.281
<v Speaker 2>religion,</v>

95
00:02:51.281 --> 00:02:51.851
<v Speaker 2>atheist,</v>

96
00:02:51.851 --> 00:02:52.540
<v Speaker 2>new atheism,</v>

97
00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.321
<v Speaker 2>that wasn't a thing.</v>

98
00:02:53.321 --> 00:02:54.580
<v Speaker 2>No one really talked about it.</v>

99
00:02:54.581 --> 00:02:55.750
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like a big thing.</v>

100
00:02:55.751 --> 00:02:56.584
<v Speaker 2>You have to decide,</v>

101
00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.480
<v Speaker 2>are you at the east or an atheist?</v>

102
00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.920
<v Speaker 2>No one talked about that.</v>

103
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.180
<v Speaker 2>And so my focus is really on this,</v>

104
00:03:02.181 --> 00:03:03.790
<v Speaker 2>on science and understanding things.</v>

105
00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:08.260
<v Speaker 2>Now the problem with being a sort of an intellectual or historian of science</v>

106
00:03:08.261 --> 00:03:09.490
<v Speaker 2>psychologists like I am,</v>

107
00:03:09.491 --> 00:03:12.580
<v Speaker 2>and you're interested in study beliefs like I do.</v>

108
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.540
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

109
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.750
<v Speaker 2>and then also being a public intellectual is the publisher of skeptic magazine.</v>

110
00:03:16.751 --> 00:03:19.990
<v Speaker 2>And I write this column for scientific American every month I got to essentially</v>

111
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:24.991
<v Speaker 2>debunk something or analyze something is it kind of puts you in the role of</v>

112
00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:25.360
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

113
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.481
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

114
00:03:25.481 --> 00:03:27.190
<v Speaker 2>I've got to say if this is right or wrong,</v>

115
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.110
<v Speaker 2>this is true or false or,</v>

116
00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.490
<v Speaker 2>or something in between.</v>

117
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:31.180
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

118
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.421
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

119
00:03:31.421 --> 00:03:34.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm us constantly and just kind of razor edge between,</v>

120
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.920
<v Speaker 2>I just am curious observer of people's beliefs.</v>

121
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.910
<v Speaker 2>And then on the other hand,</v>

122
00:03:39.911 --> 00:03:43.300
<v Speaker 2>I have to actually have to kind of pass judgment in writing every month,</v>

123
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.510
<v Speaker 2>well as this one correct or not correct or something in between.</v>

124
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

125
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.071
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

126
00:03:48.071 --> 00:03:48.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

127
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.080
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

128
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.913
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

129
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.531
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

130
00:03:50.531 --> 00:03:51.790
<v Speaker 2>it's at that different levels.</v>

131
00:03:51.791 --> 00:03:52.070
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

132
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.490
<v Speaker 2>sometimes I'm just talking about people's beliefs.</v>

133
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.660
<v Speaker 2>Other Times I'm at,</v>

134
00:03:55.661 --> 00:03:57.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually kind of forced to say,</v>

135
00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.461
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

136
00:03:57.461 --> 00:03:58.600
<v Speaker 2>I think this is probably true.</v>

137
00:03:58.601 --> 00:03:59.590
<v Speaker 2>We're probably not true.</v>

138
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:01.031
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

139
00:04:01.031 --> 00:04:01.211
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

140
00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:02.021
<v Speaker 2>and I think this is,</v>

141
00:04:02.021 --> 00:04:02.231
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

142
00:04:02.231 --> 00:04:02.921
<v Speaker 2>I listened to,</v>

143
00:04:02.921 --> 00:04:05.800
<v Speaker 2>I tried to listen to that first podcast you did with Sam</v>

144
00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.500
<v Speaker 2>to get through it again to me,</v>

145
00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:11.681
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

146
00:04:11.681 --> 00:04:14.680
<v Speaker 2>two hours you were just talking past each other at different levels of,</v>

147
00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

148
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:15.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

149
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.110
<v Speaker 2>Sam's laser focused on,</v>

150
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

151
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.750
<v Speaker 2>people will behave,</v>

152
00:04:19.751 --> 00:04:22.150
<v Speaker 2>they act on certain beliefs and you know,</v>

153
00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.240
<v Speaker 2>the obvious one flying planes into buildings is because you have a certain</v>

154
00:04:25.241 --> 00:04:26.380
<v Speaker 2>belief that leads to that.</v>

155
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:27.311
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

156
00:04:27.311 --> 00:04:27.851
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

157
00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:30.310
<v Speaker 2>And it would be good if people didn't believe these things that lead them to do</v>

158
00:04:30.311 --> 00:04:31.630
<v Speaker 2>those kinds of violent x.</v>

159
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.800
<v Speaker 2>But there's a whole nother level you can talk about beliefs that have nothing to</v>

160
00:04:35.801 --> 00:04:37.750
<v Speaker 2>do with leading to violence or so on.</v>

161
00:04:37.751 --> 00:04:42.160
<v Speaker 2>And to me it just depends on what's your goal when you're talking about this</v>

162
00:04:42.161 --> 00:04:43.360
<v Speaker 2>particular thing right now.</v>

163
00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.093
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

164
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.910
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

165
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.140
<v Speaker 2>so there I was good friends with Stephen Jay Gould and you know,</v>

166
00:04:50.141 --> 00:04:51.820
<v Speaker 2>I was sympathetic to his noma</v>

167
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.610
<v Speaker 2>in the sense that the world's already to tribal and so if we can calm everybody</v>

168
00:04:57.611 --> 00:04:57.971
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

169
00:04:57.971 --> 00:04:58.804
<v Speaker 2>that's good.</v>

170
00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.861
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>

171
00:04:59.861 --> 00:05:03.600
<v Speaker 2>I do think science and reason can inform and maybe even in some cases to</v>

172
00:05:03.601 --> 00:05:07.700
<v Speaker 2>determine human values and moral decisions right and wrong and so on.</v>

173
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.190
<v Speaker 2>I've written quite a bit about that too.</v>

174
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.960
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

175
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:10.481
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

176
00:05:10.481 --> 00:05:14.800
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of a different level of top of what you're talking about and what</v>

177
00:05:14.801 --> 00:05:16.600
<v Speaker 2>the goals are at that particular moment.</v>

178
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.801
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

179
00:05:17.801 --> 00:05:17.981
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

180
00:05:17.981 --> 00:05:18.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean this,</v>

181
00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.680
<v Speaker 1>the skeptic when,</v>

182
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:19.960
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

183
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.340
<v Speaker 1>when I think of a skeptic,</v>

184
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.860
<v Speaker 1>this is a strange leap of course,</v>

185
00:05:23.861 --> 00:05:24.800
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

186
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.630
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

187
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.470
<v Speaker 1>there's a scene in revelation where Christ comes back and he comes back with a</v>

188
00:05:29.471 --> 00:05:32.630
<v Speaker 1>sword coming out of his mouth and that's where he divides the damned in the</v>

189
00:05:32.631 --> 00:05:33.464
<v Speaker 1>safe.</v>

190
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.941
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

191
00:05:33.941 --> 00:05:34.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

192
00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.800
<v Speaker 1>that's also an image of the logos,</v>

193
00:05:35.801 --> 00:05:36.101
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

194
00:05:36.101 --> 00:05:40.880
<v Speaker 1>The word that brings forth order out of chaos because partly what you do as a</v>

195
00:05:40.881 --> 00:05:41.530
<v Speaker 1>skeptic,</v>

196
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.670
<v Speaker 1>it isn't so much that you dam the untrue is that you rescued the true.</v>

197
00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.630
<v Speaker 1>And that's really necessary for people because we need to stand on a rock.</v>

198
00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.500
<v Speaker 1>And one of the big problems I have with new age movement,</v>

199
00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.740
<v Speaker 1>and I've kind of studied this technically looking at the way that creative</v>

200
00:05:56.741 --> 00:05:57.410
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

201
00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.170
<v Speaker 1>because there are creative people who are critically minded and there were</v>

202
00:06:00.171 --> 00:06:04.550
<v Speaker 1>creative people who are not critically minded and non critically minded.</v>

203
00:06:04.551 --> 00:06:08.360
<v Speaker 1>Creativity seems more associated with mental illness and psychopathology.</v>

204
00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:12.470
<v Speaker 1>Or you have to be able to discriminate between what's worth saving and what</v>

205
00:06:12.471 --> 00:06:12.801
<v Speaker 1>isn't,</v>

206
00:06:12.801 --> 00:06:13.634
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

207
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.350
<v Speaker 1>And that's what a good skeptic does.</v>

208
00:06:15.351 --> 00:06:17.750
<v Speaker 1>Cause the skeptic isn't necessarily someone who says,</v>

209
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:18.201
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

210
00:06:18.201 --> 00:06:19.430
<v Speaker 1>this is all false.</v>

211
00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:21.590
<v Speaker 1>A good skeptic is someone who says,</v>

212
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:22.543
<v Speaker 1>oh look,</v>

213
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.560
<v Speaker 1>there's a kernel of truth here,</v>

214
00:06:24.561 --> 00:06:27.160
<v Speaker 1>but it's deeply buried under layers and layers of,</v>

215
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.730
<v Speaker 1>of rust and nonsense that needs to be burned away or polished away so that we</v>

216
00:06:31.731 --> 00:06:33.500
<v Speaker 1>can get to what's absolutely essential.</v>
