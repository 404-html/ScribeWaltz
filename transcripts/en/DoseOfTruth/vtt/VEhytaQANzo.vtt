1
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.090
<v Speaker 1>The first proposition that they make is that we should treat the reality that</v>

2
00:00:12.091 --> 00:00:13.860
<v Speaker 1>we're dealing with as psychologists.</v>

3
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.290
<v Speaker 1>We should treat human experiences,</v>

4
00:00:16.291 --> 00:00:17.124
<v Speaker 1>that reality.</v>

5
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.140
<v Speaker 1>And so the reality for you from a phenomenological perspective is everything you</v>

6
00:00:22.141 --> 00:00:22.921
<v Speaker 1>experienced,</v>

7
00:00:22.921 --> 00:00:25.140
<v Speaker 1>they assume everything you experience is real.</v>

8
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.530
<v Speaker 1>And they also assume that you can't actually get more real than that.</v>

9
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.240
<v Speaker 1>And so your consciousness,</v>

10
00:00:30.241 --> 00:00:30.951
<v Speaker 1>whatever that is,</v>

11
00:00:30.951 --> 00:00:34.320
<v Speaker 1>is real and your dreams are real and your emotions are real and your pain is</v>

12
00:00:34.321 --> 00:00:35.010
<v Speaker 1>real,</v>

13
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.790
<v Speaker 1>which is a really useful thing to think if you want to make sure that you're not</v>

14
00:00:38.791 --> 00:00:39.840
<v Speaker 1>going to hurt people.</v>

15
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:40.231
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

16
00:00:40.231 --> 00:00:43.230
<v Speaker 1>you kind of have to think that maybe fake pain should be treated as a</v>

17
00:00:43.231 --> 00:00:45.270
<v Speaker 1>fundamental reality instead of as an APP.</v>

18
00:00:45.271 --> 00:00:47.520
<v Speaker 1>That phenomena of some material substrate.</v>

19
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.530
<v Speaker 1>And so that's their first perspective.</v>

20
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.710
<v Speaker 1>And they took that from Heidegger because Heidegger thought that western</v>

21
00:00:52.711 --> 00:00:54.660
<v Speaker 1>philosophy had gone off,</v>

22
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.130
<v Speaker 1>got off on the wrong track,</v>

23
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.750
<v Speaker 1>3000 years ago.</v>

25
00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

26
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.000
<v Speaker 1>because we didn't really concentrate on being itself as the fundamental mystery.</v>

27
00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:06.570
<v Speaker 1>And so the fundamental mystery is why the hell is there anything?</v>

28
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.830
<v Speaker 1>And since there is something experiential Ba,</v>

29
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.870
<v Speaker 1>what are its fundamental elements?</v>

30
00:01:12.871 --> 00:01:14.880
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the phenomenological stats.</v>

31
00:01:14.881 --> 00:01:15.390
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

32
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.170
<v Speaker 1>it's completely,</v>

33
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.460
<v Speaker 1>it's not the same as a scientific approach because it starts with a different</v>

34
00:01:20.461 --> 00:01:21.300
<v Speaker 1>presupposition.</v>

35
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.901
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

36
00:01:21.901 --> 00:01:23.520
<v Speaker 1>the scientific presupposition,</v>

37
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.610
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking is that things are the objectively real elements of things are</v>

38
00:01:29.581 --> 00:01:31.170
<v Speaker 1>the most real elements.</v>

39
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.730
<v Speaker 1>And there's no sense complaining about that because it's a approach that works</v>

40
00:01:35.731 --> 00:01:37.230
<v Speaker 1>tremendously well for many,</v>

41
00:01:37.231 --> 00:01:40.440
<v Speaker 1>many things including making hydrogen bonds for example.</v>

42
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.170
<v Speaker 1>But it's also reasonable to think that,</v>

43
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.790
<v Speaker 1>well it might not be the,</v>

44
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.760
<v Speaker 1>it might not be the whole truth and nothing but the truth.</v>

45
00:01:47.761 --> 00:01:52.350
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you could also suspect that the fact that we can manufacture hydrogen</v>

46
00:01:52.351 --> 00:01:54.510
<v Speaker 1>bonds also might indicate that there's something,</v>

47
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.360
<v Speaker 1>a trifle off with our fundamental belief systems,</v>

48
00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.160
<v Speaker 1>scientific though they may be.</v>

49
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.650
<v Speaker 1>And that was certainly something that concerned Heidegger,</v>

50
00:02:01.651 --> 00:02:03.630
<v Speaker 1>even though he got all tangled up with the Nazis.</v>

51
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.730
<v Speaker 1>So the phenomenologists were trying to take a part experience as such and they</v>

52
00:02:08.731 --> 00:02:11.950
<v Speaker 1>made some some hypotheses and then some observation.</v>

53
00:02:11.951 --> 00:02:16.951
<v Speaker 1>So the first is that we're going to assume that your experience like experience</v>

54
00:02:17.011 --> 00:02:19.020
<v Speaker 1>itself is real.</v>

55
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.250
<v Speaker 1>Now you just because dreams are real and pain is real,</v>

56
00:02:23.251 --> 00:02:23.970
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean,</v>

57
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.290
<v Speaker 1>and like objects that we can all perceive our real doesn't mean you should put</v>

58
00:02:28.291 --> 00:02:29.730
<v Speaker 1>them all in the same category.</v>

59
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.940
<v Speaker 1>Like my dreams are not in the same category of reality as this table because you</v>

60
00:02:35.551 --> 00:02:38.580
<v Speaker 1>don't have access to my dreams and you have access to the table.</v>

61
00:02:38.581 --> 00:02:42.000
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't mean that my dreams and my pains and my emotions aren't real.</v>

62
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.260
<v Speaker 1>They're real.</v>

63
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.071
<v Speaker 1>So that's the first.</v>

64
00:02:44.071 --> 00:02:44.450
<v Speaker 1>Now I,</v>

65
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.050
<v Speaker 1>you should know that this is a,</v>

66
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.630
<v Speaker 1>this is a proposition.</v>

67
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.260
<v Speaker 1>What they're saying is let's act as if that's true and then worked from those</v>

68
00:02:55.231 --> 00:02:56.670
<v Speaker 1>premises and see what happens,</v>

69
00:02:56.671 --> 00:02:57.870
<v Speaker 1>see where we can get with it.</v>

70
00:02:57.871 --> 00:02:58.591
<v Speaker 1>And that that's,</v>

71
00:02:58.591 --> 00:03:01.900
<v Speaker 1>that's a reasonable thing to do because at the bottom of a theory,</v>

72
00:03:01.901 --> 00:03:02.734
<v Speaker 1>you also have,</v>

73
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.330
<v Speaker 1>you always have to put an assumption because otherwise your theory would be 100%</v>

74
00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:09.700
<v Speaker 1>right and would cover everything and it doesn't.</v>

75
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.730
<v Speaker 1>So you have to throw an assumption somewhere in there at the bottom and say,</v>

76
00:03:12.731 --> 00:03:12.971
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

77
00:03:12.971 --> 00:03:13.630
<v Speaker 1>we're not,</v>

78
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.860
<v Speaker 1>we're not questioning that.</v>

79
00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:16.120
<v Speaker 1>That's the starting point.</v>

80
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.500
<v Speaker 1>So you have to do that because you're ignorant.</v>

81
00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:21.640
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a full theory.</v>

82
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.100
<v Speaker 1>So they don't like the idea that mind can be reduced to matter.</v>

83
00:03:27.101 --> 00:03:28.360
<v Speaker 1>They're not playing that game.</v>

84
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.860
<v Speaker 1>They're not playing the game that the subject is only up phenomenal and the</v>

85
00:03:32.861 --> 00:03:33.850
<v Speaker 1>object is real.</v>

86
00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:35.170
<v Speaker 1>They don't play in that game either.</v>

87
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.220
<v Speaker 1>And it's partly because as bosses without a subject,</v>

88
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.930
<v Speaker 1>nothing at all would exist to confront objects and to imagine them as such.</v>

89
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.191
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>

90
00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:46.720
<v Speaker 1>This implies that every object,</v>

91
00:03:46.721 --> 00:03:50.710
<v Speaker 1>everything objective is merely objective in being merely objectivize by the</v>

92
00:03:50.711 --> 00:03:53.680
<v Speaker 1>subject is the most subjective thing possible.</v>

93
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.430
<v Speaker 1>It's a radical claim,</v>

94
00:03:57.431 --> 00:03:58.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

95
00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.721
<v Speaker 1>but here's,</v>

96
00:03:58.721 --> 00:03:59.860
<v Speaker 1>here's something to think about.</v>

97
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.220
<v Speaker 1>When I look at that code,</v>

98
00:04:03.221 --> 00:04:08.221
<v Speaker 1>can you might say how I perceive the object and then I make inferences about its</v>

99
00:04:09.461 --> 00:04:12.250
<v Speaker 1>use and then I evaluate it and then I use it.</v>

100
00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:12.671
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

101
00:04:12.671 --> 00:04:14.680
<v Speaker 1>that is not actually what you do.</v>

102
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.023
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

103
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.970
<v Speaker 1>it's not obvious at all that what you perceive our objects.</v>

104
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:20.860
<v Speaker 1>And if you think about it,</v>

105
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.551
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

106
00:04:21.551 --> 00:04:26.551
<v Speaker 1>people weren't perceiving scientific objects until like 1,514 50 so there was no</v>

107
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.440
<v Speaker 1>objective object before that.</v>

108
00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:38.010
<v Speaker 1>So obviously whatever we were perceiving was not precisely that because we would</v>

109
00:04:38.891 --> 00:04:40.330
<v Speaker 1>have been scientists right off the bat,</v>

110
00:04:40.331 --> 00:04:43.720
<v Speaker 1>George Kelly claimed that people were natural scientists.</v>

111
00:04:43.721 --> 00:04:44.230
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

112
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.500
<v Speaker 1>that we're always investigating hypothesis and trying to disprove them and so</v>

113
00:04:47.501 --> 00:04:47.711
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

114
00:04:47.711 --> 00:04:50.560
<v Speaker 1>And it's an interesting theory and that it's right in a sense.</v>

115
00:04:50.561 --> 00:04:52.060
<v Speaker 1>But fundamentally it's wrong.</v>

116
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.540
<v Speaker 1>We are not natural scientists were natural engineers.</v>

117
00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.250
<v Speaker 1>And when we look at the world,</v>

118
00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:58.450
<v Speaker 1>we don't see objects.</v>

119
00:04:58.451 --> 00:04:59.740
<v Speaker 1>And then in further use,</v>

120
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.440
<v Speaker 1>what we actually see is the use.</v>

121
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.851
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

122
00:05:03.851 --> 00:05:04.511
<v Speaker 1>when I look at that,</v>

123
00:05:04.511 --> 00:05:05.344
<v Speaker 1>coke can,</v>

124
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.010
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

125
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.370
<v Speaker 1>my visual system activates my motor cortex directly.</v>

126
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.480
<v Speaker 1>It can do that without me seeing the dam can consciously to some degree,</v>

127
00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.160
<v Speaker 1>because there are people with blind sight.</v>

128
00:05:15.161 --> 00:05:16.510
<v Speaker 1>I've told you about those people,</v>

129
00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:17.890
<v Speaker 1>they say they can't see.</v>

130
00:05:17.891 --> 00:05:20.080
<v Speaker 1>But if you ask them which hand do you have held up,</v>

131
00:05:20.081 --> 00:05:21.100
<v Speaker 1>they can tell you.</v>

132
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.800
<v Speaker 1>So they might not be able to see.</v>

133
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.880
<v Speaker 1>But they can map patterns from their visual system onto their motor output.</v>

134
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.301
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

135
00:05:28.301 --> 00:05:32.380
<v Speaker 1>And that's basically what Piaget said we do when we deal with the world,</v>

136
00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:33.670
<v Speaker 1>we're embodied creatures,</v>

137
00:05:33.671 --> 00:05:34.240
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

138
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.150
<v Speaker 1>And so what we see when we look around aren't objects.</v>

139
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.240
<v Speaker 1>They're things we can use and things that get in our way.</v>

140
00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.261
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

141
00:05:41.261 --> 00:05:45.610
<v Speaker 1>and that's a theory that was derived originally from Jj Gibson who wrote a great</v>

142
00:05:45.611 --> 00:05:49.540
<v Speaker 1>book on that called the visual approach to ecological ecological approach to</v>

143
00:05:49.541 --> 00:05:50.560
<v Speaker 1>visual perception.</v>

144
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.070
<v Speaker 1>And his science is a brand of pragmatism.</v>

145
00:05:54.071 --> 00:05:56.650
<v Speaker 1>And the pragmatists basically claim that you know,</v>

146
00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.080
<v Speaker 1>things including theories and perceptions have a limited range of truth and the</v>

147
00:06:02.511 --> 00:06:03.344
<v Speaker 1>truth that,</v>

148
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:03.671
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

149
00:06:03.671 --> 00:06:08.390
<v Speaker 1>that the limited range of truth is determined by the match between your actions</v>

150
00:06:08.391 --> 00:06:09.111
<v Speaker 1>and outcomes.</v>

151
00:06:09.111 --> 00:06:10.730
<v Speaker 1>So I think this is a coke can,</v>

152
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.260
<v Speaker 1>is that what it is?</v>

153
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.190
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

154
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.160
<v Speaker 1>but it's good enough for me if I want to drink a bit of coke out of it.</v>

155
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.630
<v Speaker 1>God only knows what it is.</v>

156
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:21.620
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

157
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.580
<v Speaker 1>if you go into communist China and you start advertising these things,</v>

158
00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:27.780
<v Speaker 1>then what are they?</v>

159
00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.420
<v Speaker 1>Cause this thing tells a story,</v>

160
00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:31.500
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

161
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.880
<v Speaker 1>What's the story like?</v>

162
00:06:32.881 --> 00:06:33.241
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

163
00:06:33.241 --> 00:06:34.380
<v Speaker 1>Do you need Coca Cola?</v>

164
00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.340
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

165
00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.470
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's a bit of Frippery,</v>

166
00:06:37.471 --> 00:06:37.741
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

167
00:06:37.741 --> 00:06:38.230
<v Speaker 1>it's a bit of,</v>

168
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:39.810
<v Speaker 1>it's not unnecessary luxury.</v>

169
00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:41.340
<v Speaker 1>It's not even very good for you,</v>

170
00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.490
<v Speaker 1>but it's kind of fuzzy and it's sweet and you get to buy it.</v>

171
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:45.870
<v Speaker 1>And why is that?</v>

172
00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:49.470
<v Speaker 1>Because no matter how stupid you are and your nutrition choices,</v>

173
00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:51.480
<v Speaker 1>as far as our society goes,</v>

174
00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:56.400
<v Speaker 1>you have the right to poison yourself in whatever way you think best fits you.</v>

175
00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:00.630
<v Speaker 1>And so when you send this little coke can off to communist China,</v>

176
00:07:00.631 --> 00:07:03.900
<v Speaker 1>this thing screams stupid individuality all over.</v>

177
00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.750
<v Speaker 1>And God only knows how it undermines the state.</v>

178
00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:07.441
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

179
00:07:07.441 --> 00:07:08.010
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't,</v>

180
00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:09.240
<v Speaker 1>if you're not thinking about that,</v>

181
00:07:09.241 --> 00:07:10.074
<v Speaker 1>you're not thinking.</v>

182
00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:12.690
<v Speaker 1>Think about what happens when we export cars.</v>

183
00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.280
<v Speaker 1>What does the car say?</v>

184
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:16.503
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>

185
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.433
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

186
00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.510
<v Speaker 1>you can go wherever you want,</v>

187
00:07:19.511 --> 00:07:20.081
<v Speaker 1>whenever you want.</v>

188
00:07:20.081 --> 00:07:23.350
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to tell anybody at all and you can do it in a really dangerous</v>

189
00:07:23.351 --> 00:07:24.520
<v Speaker 1>high speed manner.</v>

190
00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:27.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like you want a political statement,</v>

191
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.070
<v Speaker 1>wrap it up in metal and ship that thing off.</v>

192
00:07:30.071 --> 00:07:30.840
<v Speaker 1>And everybody goes,</v>

193
00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:31.480
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

194
00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.010
<v Speaker 1>I really liked to have one of those.</v>

195
00:07:33.011 --> 00:07:33.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

196
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:34.180
<v Speaker 1>poof,</v>

197
00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.250
<v Speaker 1>communism disappears with that.</v>

198
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

199
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:41.320
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing that says individuality and capitalism,</v>

200
00:07:41.321 --> 00:07:43.510
<v Speaker 1>like a personal automobile.</v>

201
00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:44.111
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

202
00:07:44.111 --> 00:07:47.680
<v Speaker 1>You even get to pollute the atmosphere and ruin the planet with the damn thing.</v>

203
00:07:47.681 --> 00:07:48.330
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

204
00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.340
<v Speaker 1>if you have to drive to the corner store and pick up your damn coke,</v>

205
00:07:51.341 --> 00:07:52.960
<v Speaker 1>it's like to hell with the atmosphere.</v>

206
00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:53.300
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
