1
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.153
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

2
00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.660
<v Speaker 1>what if the truth could unravel your entire life?</v>

3
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:07.251
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5
00:00:07.251 --> 00:00:07.731
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

6
00:00:07.731 --> 00:00:08.564
<v Speaker 1>it would,</v>

7
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:09.561
<v Speaker 1>and second,</v>

8
00:00:09.561 --> 00:00:09.831
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

9
00:00:09.831 --> 00:00:10.730
<v Speaker 1>I know what you mean.</v>

10
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.090
<v Speaker 1>You mean what if I suppose a cardinal case there would be that you did something</v>

11
00:00:16.431 --> 00:00:18.500
<v Speaker 1>really terrible and then if that was revealed,</v>

12
00:00:18.501 --> 00:00:21.350
<v Speaker 1>it would be a catastrophic situation.</v>

13
00:00:21.351 --> 00:00:24.440
<v Speaker 1>It's like without knowing the details of that,</v>

14
00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:26.510
<v Speaker 1>I can't provide a generic answer.</v>

15
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:27.171
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

16
00:00:27.171 --> 00:00:32.171
<v Speaker 1>I think that there are some sins that are so egregious that you don't get to</v>

17
00:00:32.211 --> 00:00:33.160
<v Speaker 1>confess to them.</v>

18
00:00:33.161 --> 00:00:33.620
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

19
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.240
<v Speaker 1>Like if you've done something terrible,</v>

20
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.160
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not recommending this,</v>

21
00:00:37.161 --> 00:00:38.180
<v Speaker 1>it's just an example.</v>

22
00:00:38.181 --> 00:00:41.420
<v Speaker 1>If you've done something terrible and you know that if you revealed and it would</v>

23
00:00:41.421 --> 00:00:44.180
<v Speaker 1>blow the lives of many people around you apart,</v>

24
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.390
<v Speaker 1>it isn't obvious to me that you have any moral justification for confessing just</v>

25
00:00:50.751 --> 00:00:52.400
<v Speaker 1>to free your miserable soul.</v>

26
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.450
<v Speaker 1>So what if the truth could unravel your entire life?</v>

27
00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.140
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe you need to go to Catholic confession and let someone know exactly what</v>

28
00:01:00.141 --> 00:01:00.531
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

29
00:01:00.531 --> 00:01:01.700
<v Speaker 1>So you're clear about it then.</v>

30
00:01:01.701 --> 00:01:05.330
<v Speaker 1>Then maybe what you need to do is to swear to whatever God you worship that</v>

31
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.540
<v Speaker 1>you're going to try to walk the straight and narrow from here on in.</v>

32
00:01:08.541 --> 00:01:13.190
<v Speaker 1>And that'll be sufficient to atone for whatever terrible thing that you did.</v>

33
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:14.270
<v Speaker 1>And that's a,</v>

34
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.650
<v Speaker 1>that's a form of prayer.</v>

35
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.410
<v Speaker 1>And it sounds like one that you desperately need,</v>

36
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.670
<v Speaker 1>at least in principle.</v>

37
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.900
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

38
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:21.733
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

39
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.590
<v Speaker 1>without knowing the details,</v>

40
00:01:25.591 --> 00:01:26.970
<v Speaker 1>that's about the best I can do.</v>

41
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.050
<v Speaker 1>I think what put you over with so many of us was the constructive message of how</v>

42
00:01:37.051 --> 00:01:37.980
<v Speaker 1>to be a good man.</v>

43
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

44
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.720
<v Speaker 1>a good person I would say.</v>

45
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.510
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that's where the media want you to go?</v>

46
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

47
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:44.830
<v Speaker 1>Generally not day.</v>

48
00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.250
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned this earlier,</v>

49
00:01:47.251 --> 00:01:51.480
<v Speaker 1>is that the media as it disintegrates and it certainly is disintegrating at an</v>

50
00:01:51.481 --> 00:01:52.770
<v Speaker 1>incredibly rapid rate.</v>

51
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.113
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

52
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.220
<v Speaker 1>everything is political there.</v>

53
00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.280
<v Speaker 1>It's less if the philosophical and the psychological and the theological don't</v>

54
00:02:01.531 --> 00:02:02.364
<v Speaker 1>exist.</v>

55
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.331
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

56
00:02:03.331 --> 00:02:08.331
<v Speaker 1>increasingly in my interviews I've been talking about what's been happening at</v>

57
00:02:08.371 --> 00:02:12.870
<v Speaker 1>my lectures on my tour and describing the fact that the vast majority of the</v>

58
00:02:12.871 --> 00:02:14.970
<v Speaker 1>audience isn't there for political reasons at all.</v>

59
00:02:14.971 --> 00:02:18.750
<v Speaker 1>They were there because they want to figure out how to have a responsible and</v>

60
00:02:18.751 --> 00:02:22.950
<v Speaker 1>meaningful life and it's as if that story just doesn't exist.</v>

61
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:23.610
<v Speaker 1>The the,</v>

62
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.630
<v Speaker 1>the framework,</v>

63
00:02:24.631 --> 00:02:28.500
<v Speaker 1>which is basically a political framework and increasingly a politically correct</v>

64
00:02:28.501 --> 00:02:32.280
<v Speaker 1>framework doesn't allow that to exist as a reality.</v>

65
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.380
<v Speaker 1>And that's why,</v>

66
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.203
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

67
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm much more comfortable lecturing to the crowds that have been coming to see</v>

68
00:02:42.241 --> 00:02:43.970
<v Speaker 1>me then I am talking to journalists.</v>

69
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:44.813
<v Speaker 1>It's become,</v>

70
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.691
<v Speaker 1>I have to,</v>

71
00:02:45.691 --> 00:02:46.860
<v Speaker 1>I have been limiting my,</v>

72
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.060
<v Speaker 1>my interactions with journalists even though that might not be self evident yet.</v>

73
00:02:51.061 --> 00:02:52.350
<v Speaker 1>I have been trying to do that,</v>

74
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.380
<v Speaker 1>that the demands have been increasing.</v>

75
00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.040
<v Speaker 1>So the proportion of media invitations that I've responding to has fallen</v>

76
00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:07.480
<v Speaker 1>dramatically even though the absolute number hasn't declined as precipitously.</v>

77
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.850
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that while I find the,</v>

78
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.600
<v Speaker 1>I find the typical interview very stressful,</v>

79
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.991
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

80
00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:14.830
<v Speaker 1>very stressful.</v>

81
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm on guard.</v>

82
00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:20.560
<v Speaker 1>And I would say also my attitude isn't as good as it could be any more because</v>

83
00:03:20.561 --> 00:03:21.394
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>

84
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

85
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.980
<v Speaker 1>because I'm on guard so much,</v>

86
00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:28.420
<v Speaker 1>it's easier for me to get a bit snappy and an unpleasant and that's bad.</v>

87
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.051
<v Speaker 1>That's bad.</v>

88
00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:29.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do that.</v>

89
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.280
<v Speaker 1>I want to stay calm and detached and try to,</v>

90
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:34.211
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

91
00:03:34.211 --> 00:03:38.410
<v Speaker 1>tell the truth and be happy that I'm there regardless of the circumstances.</v>

92
00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:39.430
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

93
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.210
<v Speaker 1>the fact that the mainstream media,</v>

94
00:03:43.211 --> 00:03:43.840
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

95
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.570
<v Speaker 1>is not very receptive,</v>

96
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.460
<v Speaker 1>although sometimes there's exceptions,</v>

97
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.560
<v Speaker 1>not very receptive to the idea that I could just be going around talking to</v>

98
00:03:53.561 --> 00:03:56.890
<v Speaker 1>people who want to get their life together is quite saddening.</v>

99
00:03:56.891 --> 00:04:01.540
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's definitely a commentary on the fundamental corruption of our</v>

100
00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:03.010
<v Speaker 1>media apparatus.</v>

101
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.350
<v Speaker 1>I think it's better to talk on youtube,</v>

102
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.780
<v Speaker 1>to speak on my podcast,</v>

103
00:04:13.781 --> 00:04:14.830
<v Speaker 1>to do these lectures,</v>

104
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.830
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's increasingly better to do that.</v>

105
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.920
<v Speaker 1>The long form discussions on youtube though with people like Joe Rogan and Dave</v>

106
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:23.400
<v Speaker 1>Rubin and,</v>

107
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.233
<v Speaker 1>and so forth,</v>

108
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:25.720
<v Speaker 1>that works just fine.</v>

109
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.260
<v Speaker 1>So the new media form is emerging and I think it's going to be a lot more</v>

110
00:04:31.601 --> 00:04:32.390
<v Speaker 1>productive.</v>

111
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

112
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.910
<v Speaker 1>it won't be a scripted,</v>

113
00:04:33.911 --> 00:04:35.230
<v Speaker 1>it'll be much longer forum.</v>

114
00:04:35.231 --> 00:04:37.660
<v Speaker 1>It will be allowed for much more thoughtfulness.</v>

115
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.173
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

116
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:40.583
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

117
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:43.493
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

118
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.080
<v Speaker 1>but it's okay.</v>

119
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.630
<v Speaker 1>It's not like the media exposure,</v>

120
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.100
<v Speaker 1>although it's been stressful.</v>

121
00:04:50.101 --> 00:04:51.930
<v Speaker 1>It's not like I'm not grateful for it.</v>

122
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.030
<v Speaker 1>Even people who've put me on the spot very badly have ended up doing me a</v>

123
00:04:57.031 --> 00:04:58.110
<v Speaker 1>tremendous favor.</v>

124
00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:59.730
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is,</v>

125
00:04:59.731 --> 00:05:01.260
<v Speaker 1>is that because</v>

126
00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.863
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

127
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.850
<v Speaker 1>the problem is I'm becoming too much on garden and I,</v>

128
00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:08.730
<v Speaker 1>I've noticed,</v>

129
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:09.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

130
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:14.390
<v Speaker 1>developing sense of impatience within me and some suspicion,</v>

131
00:05:14.611 --> 00:05:16.380
<v Speaker 1>and that's not good.</v>

132
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be in situations where those are my fundamental orientations.</v>

133
00:05:20.131 --> 00:05:20.500
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

134
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.270
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

135
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.240
<v Speaker 1>it's a sign of a certain amount of internal corruption on my part.</v>

136
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:25.351
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

137
00:05:25.351 --> 00:05:26.184
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

138
00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.090
<v Speaker 1>I want to be in situations where I'm speaking with people,</v>

139
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.000
<v Speaker 1>speaking honestly to people who are honestly listening.</v>

140
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:34.470
<v Speaker 1>That would be,</v>

141
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:35.610
<v Speaker 1>that's a good situation.</v>

142
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:36.713
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

143
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:42.690
<v Speaker 1>would you agree with Cs Lewis?</v>

144
00:05:42.691 --> 00:05:43.860
<v Speaker 1>That if you look for truth,</v>

145
00:05:43.861 --> 00:05:44.940
<v Speaker 1>you may find comfort?</v>

146
00:05:44.941 --> 00:05:45.900
<v Speaker 1>If you look for comfort,</v>

147
00:05:45.901 --> 00:05:47.010
<v Speaker 1>you will find despair?</v>

148
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.521
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>

149
00:05:47.521 --> 00:05:48.780
<v Speaker 1>That's definitely the case.</v>

150
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.180
<v Speaker 1>It's quite an intelligent phrase because he says,</v>

151
00:05:51.181 --> 00:05:52.140
<v Speaker 1>if you look for truth,</v>

152
00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.090
<v Speaker 1>you may find comfort.</v>

153
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.640
<v Speaker 1>He didn't say you will find comfort.</v>

154
00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:57.171
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

155
00:05:57.171 --> 00:05:57.351
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

156
00:05:57.351 --> 00:05:58.610
<v Speaker 1>sometimes if you look for truth,</v>

157
00:05:58.611 --> 00:06:00.140
<v Speaker 1>you don't find comfort to begin with.</v>

158
00:06:00.141 --> 00:06:00.711
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>

159
00:06:00.711 --> 00:06:01.910
<v Speaker 1>You find a lot of trouble.</v>

160
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.720
<v Speaker 1>But sometimes you have to go through a lot of trouble to get to set things</v>

161
00:06:05.721 --> 00:06:06.530
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

162
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:07.760
<v Speaker 1>If you look for comfort,</v>

163
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.670
<v Speaker 1>despair,</v>

164
00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:12.410
<v Speaker 1>well the reason for that is that you can't look for comfort in life.</v>

165
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.990
<v Speaker 1>Life isn't about comfort.</v>

166
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.270
<v Speaker 1>Life is a deadly game.</v>

167
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:19.730
<v Speaker 1>It's a game of life and death.</v>

168
00:06:19.731 --> 00:06:21.020
<v Speaker 1>It's a game of good and evil.</v>

169
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.690
<v Speaker 1>It's everything's on the line.</v>

170
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.700
<v Speaker 1>Your sanity's on the line,</v>

171
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.953
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

172
00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:30.570
<v Speaker 1>your freedom from pain is on the line.</v>

173
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.580
<v Speaker 1>Your freedom from despair is on the line.</v>

174
00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.050
<v Speaker 1>Your families on the line,</v>

175
00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.400
<v Speaker 1>there's no comfort.</v>

176
00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:36.900
<v Speaker 1>Life is an adventure.</v>

177
00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:42.470
<v Speaker 1>And I think the greatest adventure that you can possibly have is one is the one</v>

178
00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:46.410
<v Speaker 1>that you find if you look for the truth.</v>

179
00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.650
<v Speaker 1>And that's a good place to stop.</v>

180
00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:52.750
<v Speaker 1>That's been 90 minutes.</v>

181
00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:53.823
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

182
00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:59.070
<v Speaker 1>I've been reasonably sharp and with it for the full 90 minutes.</v>

183
00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.960
<v Speaker 1>And so I think I'll bring it to a close,</v>

184
00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:07.830
<v Speaker 1>just a couple of reminders for those of you who tuned in late.</v>

185
00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.040
<v Speaker 1>If you want to try out the self authoring program,</v>

186
00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:15.840
<v Speaker 1>I made a code August and that an titles you did 20% off,</v>

187
00:07:15.841 --> 00:07:18.810
<v Speaker 1>there's a two for one special so you can give it to a friend as well.</v>

188
00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.060
<v Speaker 1>If you want to try understand myself,</v>

189
00:07:21.061 --> 00:07:25.020
<v Speaker 1>which is a personality test only takes about 15 minutes.</v>

190
00:07:25.021 --> 00:07:27.450
<v Speaker 1>It's quite a bit easier than the self authoring suite.</v>

191
00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:28.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

192
00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.300
<v Speaker 1>the code for that is also August.</v>

193
00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.160
<v Speaker 1>That also gives you 20% off.</v>

194
00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:36.510
<v Speaker 1>Self authoring helps you write about your past and present and future and you</v>

195
00:07:36.511 --> 00:07:40.680
<v Speaker 1>can do a bad job and if you haven't developed a life plan and you don't know</v>

196
00:07:40.681 --> 00:07:42.510
<v Speaker 1>where you are and you don't know where you're going,</v>

197
00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:46.590
<v Speaker 1>then I would highly recommend trying the program and you're welcome to do a bad</v>

198
00:07:46.591 --> 00:07:49.530
<v Speaker 1>job at it because a bad plan is,</v>

199
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:51.510
<v Speaker 1>is a lot better than no plan at all.</v>

200
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:56.380
<v Speaker 1>And understand myself will help you understand who you are for better or worse.</v>

201
00:07:56.381 --> 00:07:56.850
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

202
00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:59.310
<v Speaker 1>and people have responded quite positively to it.</v>

203
00:07:59.311 --> 00:08:03.990
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's worth the 15 minutes in the nine 95 that it costs,</v>

204
00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:05.163
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

205
00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:06.660
<v Speaker 1>discounted 20% now.</v>

206
00:08:06.661 --> 00:08:08.490
<v Speaker 1>So I guess that's about seven 95,</v>

207
00:08:08.491 --> 00:08:09.324
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

208
00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:10.650
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

209
00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:11.723
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

210
00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:14.520
<v Speaker 1>the second Iceland lecturer is going to come out soon.</v>

211
00:08:14.521 --> 00:08:16.140
<v Speaker 1>I released the first Iceland lecture,</v>

212
00:08:16.141 --> 00:08:17.730
<v Speaker 1>which is part of 12 rules for life.</v>

213
00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:21.660
<v Speaker 1>I have a tour coming out through the northeastern part of the United States</v>

214
00:08:21.661 --> 00:08:26.640
<v Speaker 1>starting in September and then over to the UK and northern Europe in September</v>

215
00:08:26.641 --> 00:08:29.610
<v Speaker 1>and October and then Australia and New Zealand in February.</v>

216
00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.073
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

217
00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:33.540
<v Speaker 1>I've really enjoyed the tour.</v>

218
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.150
<v Speaker 1>I think it's an amazing opportunity.</v>

219
00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.880
<v Speaker 1>It's been extraordinarily heartwarming,</v>

220
00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:42.720
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

221
00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.570
<v Speaker 1>to talk to so many people who are trying to put their lives together.</v>

222
00:08:45.571 --> 00:08:46.770
<v Speaker 1>And if enough people do that,</v>

223
00:08:46.771 --> 00:08:50.580
<v Speaker 1>then they will put their lives together and that will help put everything else</v>

224
00:08:50.581 --> 00:08:51.414
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

225
00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:54.240
<v Speaker 1>And so we'll hopefully these Q and A's are a smart,</v>

226
00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:55.380
<v Speaker 1>small part that,</v>

227
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.590
<v Speaker 1>so thank you very much for listening in.</v>

228
00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:01.920
<v Speaker 1>And I'll try to do one in September.</v>

229
00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:02.670
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

230
00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:03.301
<v Speaker 1>if I don't,</v>

231
00:09:03.301 --> 00:09:05.430
<v Speaker 1>it's because I'm on the road all the time,</v>

232
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:07.740
<v Speaker 1>but I will definitely try to do one in September.</v>

233
00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:09.990
<v Speaker 1>So thank you for,</v>

234
00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.520
<v Speaker 1>to my patrion supporters.</v>

235
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:12.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

236
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:16.380
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned to you guys that I am working hard on the online university and have</v>

237
00:09:16.381 --> 00:09:18.330
<v Speaker 1>hired three people to work on that and that we're,</v>

238
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:19.830
<v Speaker 1>we're about a year ahead of schedule,</v>

239
00:09:19.831 --> 00:09:20.400
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

240
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.181
<v Speaker 1>where I thought I'd be,</v>

241
00:09:21.181 --> 00:09:21.961
<v Speaker 1>so in three months,</v>

242
00:09:21.961 --> 00:09:23.640
<v Speaker 1>we're a year ahead of where I figured I'd be.</v>

243
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:24.533
<v Speaker 1>We'd be.</v>

244
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:25.463
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

245
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:26.400
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

246
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.180
<v Speaker 1>thanks again.</v>

247
00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:28.013
<v Speaker 1>Good night.</v>

248
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:28.800
<v Speaker 1>Ciao.</v>
