00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.210
<v Speaker 1>I was wondering what your thoughts are</v>
<v Speaker 1>on meditation and if you practice it</v>

2
00:00:14.211 --> 00:00:15.740
<v Speaker 1>yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.980
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I practiced it a lot and look,</v>

4
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.270
<v Speaker 1>when I listened to someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even when I listened to myself,</v>

5
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.200
<v Speaker 1>but let's say when I listened to someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my clinical practice,</v>

6
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.440
<v Speaker 1>I think I do it in a meditative way in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I sit and listen and I wait for</v>

7
00:00:36.591 --> 00:00:39.920
<v Speaker 1>thoughts to appear rather than</v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily thinking.</v>

8
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.990
<v Speaker 1>So I clear my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to keep my agenda's off the table,</v>

9
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.610
<v Speaker 1>my agendas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever they are,</v>

10
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.380
<v Speaker 1>except that I want the best for my</v>
<v Speaker 1>client in this hour and the best say by</v>

11
00:00:51.381 --> 00:00:54.470
<v Speaker 1>their definition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And mine jointly decided because that's</v>

12
00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:57.500
<v Speaker 1>all part of discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I listened very carefully and I</v>

13
00:00:57.501 --> 00:01:02.501
<v Speaker 1>wait for the reactions that occur within</v>
<v Speaker 1>me and then I share them.</v>

14
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.660
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's a meditative</v>
<v Speaker 1>exercise.</v>

15
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.670
<v Speaker 1>I think it's different than voluntary</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>

16
00:01:07.671 --> 00:01:08.750
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:01:08.751 --> 00:01:13.190
<v Speaker 1>there's a statement in the new testament</v>
<v Speaker 1>that says a knock and the door will</v>

18
00:01:13.191 --> 00:01:15.080
<v Speaker 1>open,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask and you will receive.</v>

19
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.610
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a meditative,</v>

20
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.090
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a call to a meditative mode of</v>

21
00:01:23.091 --> 00:01:24.500
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

22
00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:26.420
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often what I do,</v>

23
00:01:26.421 --> 00:01:28.700
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I want to solve a problem is I,</v>

24
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.170
<v Speaker 1>if I have a problem with my own behavior</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe I'm having problems in my</v>

25
00:01:33.171 --> 00:01:36.740
<v Speaker 1>family is all go sit on a badge or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>chair and they'll think,</v>

26
00:01:36.741 --> 00:01:39.920
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like an answer to this.</v>

27
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.050
<v Speaker 1>I would like to know what the answer to</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

28
00:01:42.051 --> 00:01:46.010
<v Speaker 1>And I'm willing to accept whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>answer is appropriate.</v>

29
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.920
<v Speaker 1>And cause usually you get an answer that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't like.</v>

30
00:01:48.921 --> 00:01:50.060
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's a real answer,</v>

31
00:01:50.061 --> 00:01:52.490
<v Speaker 1>it's not something that you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be all that happy about and then</v>

32
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.600
<v Speaker 1>magically so to speak and answer</v>
<v Speaker 1>appears.</v>

33
00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.790
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's a meditative practice</v>
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

34
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.590
<v Speaker 1>the meditative practices part to clear</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mind of your proximal concerns and</v>

35
00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:13.001
<v Speaker 1>to concentrate more deeply on what might</v>
<v Speaker 1>be regarded as eternally true and to</v>

36
00:02:14.061 --> 00:02:19.061
<v Speaker 1>open yourself up for a revelation in</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to what is eternally true.</v>

37
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.650
<v Speaker 1>And I found that incredibly effective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that you can live like that.</v>

38
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.870
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just have to abandon your proximal</v>

39
00:02:29.871 --> 00:02:31.460
<v Speaker 1>pursuits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now in my new book,</v>

40
00:02:31.461 --> 00:02:35.540
<v Speaker 1>again I wrote a chapter about that</v>
<v Speaker 1>called do what is meaningful and what</v>

41
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.090
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is expedient and it's a bit of a</v>

42
00:02:38.091 --> 00:02:42.290
<v Speaker 1>meditation on the sermon on the mount I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would say because the essential message</v>

43
00:02:42.291 --> 00:02:45.290
<v Speaker 1>in the sermon on the Mount,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the foundational document of</v>

44
00:02:45.291 --> 00:02:47.360
<v Speaker 1>Western civilization as far as I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned,</v>

45
00:02:47.361 --> 00:02:51.560
<v Speaker 1>essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you should orient yourself</v>

46
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.300
<v Speaker 1>ultimately towards the highest good that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can conceive.</v>

47
00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.250
<v Speaker 1>And I've tried to formulate that and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentioned that earlier in this Q and a</v>

48
00:03:00.251 --> 00:03:04.270
<v Speaker 1>that the highest good that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceive it should be something like</v>

49
00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:08.920
<v Speaker 1>what would be good for you now and good</v>
<v Speaker 1>for you tomorrow and next week and next</v>

50
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.770
<v Speaker 1>month and next year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So good for you and all the future use</v>

51
00:03:11.771 --> 00:03:15.220
<v Speaker 1>that might exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also at the same time,</v>

52
00:03:15.221 --> 00:03:18.280
<v Speaker 1>good for your family and good for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>

53
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualized narrowly and broadly and</v>

54
00:03:22.631 --> 00:03:25.840
<v Speaker 1>good now for your family and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>community and then also into the future.</v>

55
00:03:25.841 --> 00:03:27.160
<v Speaker 1>So it's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

56
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.840
<v Speaker 1>it's a balance of goods that stretches</v>
<v Speaker 1>across time and you have to decide if</v>

57
00:03:31.841 --> 00:03:35.320
<v Speaker 1>that's what you really want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my sense would be you haven't got</v>

58
00:03:35.321 --> 00:03:37.780
<v Speaker 1>anything better to aim at and that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>should aim at.</v>

59
00:03:37.781 --> 00:03:40.280
<v Speaker 1>The best thing that you can aim at for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole bunch of reasons.</v>

60
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.590
<v Speaker 1>One is if you don't aim at something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're certainly not going to attain it.</v>

61
00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:47.800
<v Speaker 1>And if you're going to aim at something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not aim for the best thing that you</v>

62
00:03:47.801 --> 00:03:50.680
<v Speaker 1>can think of?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you do aim for the best thing</v>

63
00:03:50.681 --> 00:03:53.200
<v Speaker 1>that you can think of and you make any</v>
<v Speaker 1>progress whatsoever,</v>

64
00:03:53.201 --> 00:03:57.040
<v Speaker 1>it's extremely exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you do aim for the best thing you</v>

65
00:03:57.041 --> 00:04:00.910
<v Speaker 1>can think of and you make some progress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's very life affirming and</v>

66
00:04:00.911 --> 00:04:04.780
<v Speaker 1>validating and that sort of quells your</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety and your existential pain.</v>

67
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.560
<v Speaker 1>And so he get yourself properly</v>
<v Speaker 1>oriented.</v>

68
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.150
<v Speaker 1>And the sermon on the mount basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>suggest that you do that by orienting</v>

69
00:04:13.151 --> 00:04:16.450
<v Speaker 1>yourself towards God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for the psychological purposes,</v>

70
00:04:16.451 --> 00:04:21.010
<v Speaker 1>we could conceptualize God as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>highest good that you can conceive of.</v>

71
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.090
<v Speaker 1>And then you concentrate on the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can get up in the morning and</v>

72
00:04:25.091 --> 00:04:25.930
<v Speaker 1>you can think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

73
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.630
<v Speaker 1>I want the best possible thing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

74
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.740
<v Speaker 1>And so what is it that I should do to</v>
<v Speaker 1>serve that?</v>

75
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.340
<v Speaker 1>And if you ask that genuinely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's in a meditative way,</v>

76
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.530
<v Speaker 1>I will say you get an answer to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>right away.</v>

77
00:04:38.531 --> 00:04:39.640
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem is,</v>

78
00:04:39.641 --> 00:04:42.700
<v Speaker 1>is that it's usually an answer that</v>
<v Speaker 1>involves some kind of sacrifice.</v>

79
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.140
<v Speaker 1>It means that instead of doing what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>would like to do impulsively right now,</v>

80
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.630
<v Speaker 1>you're more likely to have to go do</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

81
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.210
<v Speaker 1>You know that you've been avoiding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's difficult.</v>

82
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.470
<v Speaker 1>But if you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you'll have some,</v>

83
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can also leave in your day with some</v>

84
00:04:59.171 --> 00:05:00.350
<v Speaker 1>pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

85
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.800
<v Speaker 1>to reward yourself for doing something</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult.</v>

86
00:05:02.801 --> 00:05:04.390
<v Speaker 1>But if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you live that way,</v>

87
00:05:04.391 --> 00:05:06.880
<v Speaker 1>then I think that your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your house stays clean in,</v>

88
00:05:06.881 --> 00:05:11.290
<v Speaker 1>your family stays organized and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>state doesn't rock and all that,</v>

89
00:05:11.291 --> 00:05:13.600
<v Speaker 1>and all that's extremely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely good.</v>

90
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.590
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
