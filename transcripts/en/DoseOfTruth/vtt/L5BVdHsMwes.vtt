1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.470
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

2
00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.910
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's happened in Ontario recently is that we've,</v>

3
00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:06.950
<v Speaker 1>our our government is introduced</v>

4
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.030
<v Speaker 1>legislation that is predicated on the idea that all families are equal and the,</v>

5
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.630
<v Speaker 1>the idea behind that you could argue is laudable.</v>

6
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.670
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't argue that,</v>

7
00:00:20.671 --> 00:00:23.680
<v Speaker 1>but you could argue it that you know,</v>

8
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.650
<v Speaker 1>people have a variety of ways of solving the problem of having children and that</v>

9
00:00:28.651 --> 00:00:33.651
<v Speaker 1>there's a variety of viable solutions to that problem and that no one family</v>

10
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.400
<v Speaker 1>organizational type should be privileged above the others.</v>

11
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

12
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.300
<v Speaker 1>I suppose with the exception of multipart in your marriages,</v>

13
00:00:42.301 --> 00:00:45.090
<v Speaker 1>which we still don't approve of.</v>

14
00:00:45.091 --> 00:00:49.830
<v Speaker 1>Let's say the problem with that as far as I can tell is that it does appear from</v>

15
00:00:49.831 --> 00:00:54.690
<v Speaker 1>the research that the nuclear family is the smallest viable unit.</v>

16
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.280
<v Speaker 1>Which is not to say that there aren't single mothers or single fathers who do an</v>

17
00:00:59.281 --> 00:01:01.500
<v Speaker 1>admirable job under trying conditions.</v>

18
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.790
<v Speaker 1>But part of the problem,</v>

19
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.020
<v Speaker 1>this is a deep problem,</v>

20
00:01:04.021 --> 00:01:04.854
<v Speaker 1>is that</v>

21
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.073
<v Speaker 1>whenever you,</v>

22
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.370
<v Speaker 1>whenever you pause it,</v>

23
00:01:08.371 --> 00:01:09.480
<v Speaker 1>something as a value.</v>

24
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.201
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>

25
00:01:10.201 --> 00:01:10.381
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

26
00:01:10.381 --> 00:01:12.510
<v Speaker 1>we want intact families,</v>

27
00:01:12.511 --> 00:01:13.500
<v Speaker 1>mother and father.</v>

28
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.160
<v Speaker 1>That's the.</v>

29
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.950
<v Speaker 1>That's the value we're heading for because that seems to be best for the</v>

30
00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:17.610
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>

31
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.660
<v Speaker 1>Then you produce a rank order of accordance with that and the people who aren't</v>

32
00:01:21.661 --> 00:01:22.980
<v Speaker 1>in accordance with that value,</v>

33
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.940
<v Speaker 1>you can easily make a case that they're being discriminated against and we're in</v>

34
00:01:26.941 --> 00:01:31.680
<v Speaker 1>a situation in our society now where even if the discrimination occurs,</v>

35
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:32.663
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

36
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.130
<v Speaker 1>because of the pursuit of an admirable value,</v>

37
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.630
<v Speaker 1>it's regarded as prejudicial and I think that's fed by that underlying</v>

38
00:01:39.631 --> 00:01:43.020
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis that was anti nuclear family,</v>

39
00:01:43.021 --> 00:01:48.021
<v Speaker 1>that any sort of hierarchical structure is part of the tear radical patriarchy.</v>

40
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.040
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that that's running underneath it.</v>

41
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.821
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

42
00:01:50.821 --> 00:01:53.370
<v Speaker 1>let's review if you would be very helpful.</v>

43
00:01:53.371 --> 00:01:54.300
<v Speaker 1>I think for everyone,</v>

44
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.800
<v Speaker 1>some of the many ways that it's necessary for children to have fathers,</v>

45
00:01:58.801 --> 00:02:02.280
<v Speaker 1>why that's better and perhaps also for for society as well,</v>

46
00:02:02.281 --> 00:02:03.300
<v Speaker 1>not just for children.</v>

47
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:04.723
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

48
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.350
<v Speaker 2>Children that have a lot about an equal or more than equal father involvement</v>

49
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.250
<v Speaker 2>have a number of things in common as a rule and obviously there's reversals of</v>

50
00:02:13.251 --> 00:02:15.680
<v Speaker 2>this and not that everyone puts this,</v>

51
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.010
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

52
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.843
<v Speaker 2>this pattern,</v>

53
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.420
<v Speaker 2>but the first is they're far more likely to have postpone gratification and I'll</v>

54
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.470
<v Speaker 2>elaborate on that a little bit more.</v>

55
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.800
<v Speaker 2>Postpone gratification is probably the single most important quality to becoming</v>

56
00:02:30.471 --> 00:02:32.930
<v Speaker 2>successful and becoming successful,</v>

57
00:02:32.931 --> 00:02:37.700
<v Speaker 2>especially being employed in a job that has some meaning for you is one of the</v>

58
00:02:37.701 --> 00:02:42.701
<v Speaker 2>most important ingredients in happiness and a sense of purpose and a sense of</v>

59
00:02:43.221 --> 00:02:47.660
<v Speaker 2>motivation and a sense of willingness to get up in the morning and so I'm in a</v>

60
00:02:47.661 --> 00:02:48.081
<v Speaker 2>little while.</v>

61
00:02:48.081 --> 00:02:52.100
<v Speaker 2>I'll be happy to just trace back how that postpone gratification happens more</v>

62
00:02:52.101 --> 00:02:53.410
<v Speaker 2>when you have a father.</v>

63
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.791
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

64
00:02:53.791 --> 00:02:55.740
<v Speaker 1>because I'm really interested in hearing about that.</v>

65
00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:57.080
<v Speaker 2>Second.</v>

66
00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.270
<v Speaker 2>Second layer is far children and that have an equal amount of father involvement</v>

67
00:03:01.271 --> 00:03:02.980
<v Speaker 2>are far less likely to be depressed.</v>

68
00:03:02.981 --> 00:03:03.600
<v Speaker 2>They're far less,</v>

69
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.120
<v Speaker 2>more likely to be assertive and not aggressive,</v>

70
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.780
<v Speaker 2>which is something you usually think of men as being aggressive,</v>

71
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.610
<v Speaker 2>but actually the children,</v>

72
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.470
<v Speaker 2>both girls and boys whose fathers are involved are far more likely to understand</v>

73
00:03:17.471 --> 00:03:20.650
<v Speaker 2>the distinction between being assertive and being aggressive and choose</v>

74
00:03:20.651 --> 00:03:21.484
<v Speaker 2>assertiveness.</v>

75
00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.160
<v Speaker 2>Boys and another surprising one for me,</v>

76
00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing the research was finding that boys and girls who are raised with about</v>

77
00:03:30.161 --> 00:03:34.390
<v Speaker 2>an equal amount of father involvement are far more likely to be empathetic</v>

78
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.350
<v Speaker 2>because I always thought of empathy coming predominantly from moms and I'll be</v>

79
00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:42.130
<v Speaker 2>happy to explain in a bit why it does come more from moms,</v>

80
00:03:42.131 --> 00:03:42.701
<v Speaker 2>but why?</v>

81
00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:46.060
<v Speaker 2>The outcome for the child is not more empathy.</v>

82
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.250
<v Speaker 2>The outcome for the child is less empathy,</v>

83
00:03:48.251 --> 00:03:49.990
<v Speaker 2>so a little bit more on that later.</v>

84
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.170
<v Speaker 2>Far more likely.</v>

85
00:03:53.171 --> 00:03:56.320
<v Speaker 2>Both boys and girls should drop out of school if there isn't far.</v>

86
00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.430
<v Speaker 2>Father involvement.</v>

87
00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.500
<v Speaker 2>A far more likely when a,</v>

88
00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:00.250
<v Speaker 2>when a.</v>

89
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.480
<v Speaker 2>When a relationship breaks up,</v>

90
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.700
<v Speaker 2>a child that has not had significant father involvement is much more likely to</v>

91
00:04:06.701 --> 00:04:08.740
<v Speaker 2>be depressed and be withdrawn and b,</v>

92
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:09.910
<v Speaker 2>feel alienated.</v>

93
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm far more likely to be addicted to video games,</v>

94
00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.790
<v Speaker 2>far more likely to be addicted to video porn.</v>

95
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.013
<v Speaker 2>I'm far less,</v>

96
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:19.720
<v Speaker 2>more likely to have a few social skills,</v>

97
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.910
<v Speaker 2>few emotional skills to do worse in every academic area,</v>

98
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.250
<v Speaker 2>but especially in reading and writing,</v>

99
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.770
<v Speaker 2>which are the two biggest predictors of success,</v>

100
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.100
<v Speaker 2>a far more likely to have a lower sperm count have.</v>

101
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.730
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

102
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:34.870
<v Speaker 2>and here's an amazing thing.</v>

103
00:04:34.871 --> 00:04:39.610
<v Speaker 2>I just discovered toward the end of the research for the boy crisis I saw in</v>

104
00:04:39.611 --> 00:04:41.320
<v Speaker 2>pediatrics magazine,</v>

105
00:04:41.321 --> 00:04:46.321
<v Speaker 2>and that children who by the age of nine don't have a significant amount of</v>

106
00:04:47.351 --> 00:04:51.520
<v Speaker 2>father involvement in both girls and boys who are likely to have shorter</v>

107
00:04:51.521 --> 00:04:52.354
<v Speaker 2>telomeres.</v>

108
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.890
<v Speaker 2>And as most of us know,</v>

109
00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.020
<v Speaker 2>the telomeres are pivotal in predicting life expectancy.</v>

110
00:04:59.021 --> 00:05:00.760
<v Speaker 2>So boys and girls,</v>

111
00:05:00.761 --> 00:05:05.761
<v Speaker 2>the average shorter telomere for a nine year old boy or girl without father</v>

112
00:05:06.521 --> 00:05:09.520
<v Speaker 2>involvement was 14 percent a w,</v>

113
00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.911
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

114
00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:10.650
<v Speaker 2>it was a yes,</v>

115
00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.910
<v Speaker 2>a 14 percent shorter,</v>

116
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.530
<v Speaker 2>but the boys,</v>

117
00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.030
<v Speaker 2>telomeres were then again 40 percent shorter than the girls.</v>

118
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.200
<v Speaker 2>So here,</v>

119
00:05:20.201 --> 00:05:25.201
<v Speaker 2>this was predicting about a 14 percent shorter life expectancy for the average</v>

120
00:05:25.211 --> 00:05:28.600
<v Speaker 2>child without father involvement by the age of nine already.</v>

121
00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.940
<v Speaker 2>And yet the boys were suffering more.</v>

122
00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:32.980
<v Speaker 2>So two things fascinated me.</v>

123
00:05:32.981 --> 00:05:33.880
<v Speaker 2>There is,</v>

124
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:34.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

125
00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.520
<v Speaker 2>if all the things like,</v>

126
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:37.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

127
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.130
<v Speaker 2>dropping out of school and things like that.</v>

128
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.060
<v Speaker 2>I asked myself,</v>

129
00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.751
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

130
00:05:40.751 --> 00:05:42.970
<v Speaker 2>maybe this is because boys with father involvement,</v>

131
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:44.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm just have better,</v>

132
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.490
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

133
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:46.380
<v Speaker 2>better neighborhoods.</v>

134
00:05:46.381 --> 00:05:46.830
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

135
00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:47.370
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

136
00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.800
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

137
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.120
<v Speaker 2>the father's earned more,</v>

138
00:05:49.121 --> 00:05:49.980
<v Speaker 2>the families are more,</v>

139
00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.240
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's a matter of poverty versus poverty.</v>

140
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.600
<v Speaker 2>So I started looking at a boys and girls growing up in and good quote,</v>

141
00:05:57.801 --> 00:06:01.610
<v Speaker 2>good neighborhoods with good schools and comparing them with boys and girls</v>

142
00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:06.611
<v Speaker 2>growing up in poor neighborhoods in poor schools and found that the boys and</v>

143
00:06:06.981 --> 00:06:10.940
<v Speaker 2>girls growing up in good neighborhoods with poor schools that did not have</v>

144
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.410
<v Speaker 2>significant father involvement,</v>

145
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.740
<v Speaker 2>did about the same as boys and girls growing up in poor neighborhoods with poor</v>

146
00:06:17.901 --> 00:06:20.120
<v Speaker 2>schools that did have father involvement.</v>

147
00:06:20.121 --> 00:06:22.360
<v Speaker 2>That father involvement was really as,</v>

148
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.770
<v Speaker 2>as good a predictor of success.</v>

149
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.460
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

150
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.470
<v Speaker 2>as the quality of the school system,</v>

151
00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.440
<v Speaker 2>the quality of the neighborhood and the socioeconomic class,</v>

152
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.330
<v Speaker 2>and this is what's led to,</v>

153
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:33.643
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

154
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:39.220
<v Speaker 2>to the psychologist I'm gathering together behind people like worship 100</v>

155
00:06:39.801 --> 00:06:41.780
<v Speaker 2>psychologists and researchers saying,</v>

156
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:42.291
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

157
00:06:42.291 --> 00:06:43.700
<v Speaker 2>this is not a correlation.</v>

158
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.110
<v Speaker 2>The involvement of father,</v>

159
00:06:45.111 --> 00:06:48.050
<v Speaker 2>this is not a matter of socioeconomic issues.</v>

160
00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.870
<v Speaker 2>This is a matter of actual father's,</v>

161
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.770
<v Speaker 2>father's,</v>

162
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.000
<v Speaker 2>father's involvement,</v>

163
00:06:53.001 --> 00:06:57.710
<v Speaker 2>especially the biological father's involvement actually makes a significant</v>

164
00:06:57.711 --> 00:06:58.520
<v Speaker 2>difference.</v>

165
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.520
<v Speaker 2>We have been wrong about the assumption that this would probably just a</v>

166
00:07:01.521 --> 00:07:02.354
<v Speaker 2>correlation.</v>

167
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.820
<v Speaker 2>And so the more I looked,</v>

168
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:08.240
<v Speaker 2>the more I found just every nightmare of a parent.</v>

169
00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:09.093
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

170
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.090
<v Speaker 2>she'd be so increased,</v>

171
00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:11.691
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

172
00:07:11.691 --> 00:07:14.300
<v Speaker 2>when there was not a significant amount of father involvement.</v>

173
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.230
<v Speaker 2>And I was seeing,</v>

174
00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:17.030
<v Speaker 2>I was dating between,</v>

175
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:18.520
<v Speaker 2>before I married lives.</v>

176
00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:19.700
<v Speaker 2>The woman you just met,</v>

177
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:20.060
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

178
00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.390
<v Speaker 2>just before we got on a,</v>

179
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.590
<v Speaker 2>before we got married 14 years ago,</v>

180
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:25.280
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

181
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.810
<v Speaker 2>I was dating a number of women.</v>

182
00:07:26.811 --> 00:07:28.190
<v Speaker 2>Almost every woman had a,</v>

183
00:07:28.191 --> 00:07:30.370
<v Speaker 2>was a single mother and these,</v>

184
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:35.650
<v Speaker 2>every single woman was working her rear end to balance her life.</v>

185
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.860
<v Speaker 2>Every woman used the word overwhelmed by the way she felt.</v>

186
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:41.120
<v Speaker 2>Every.</v>

187
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.260
<v Speaker 2>Almost every woman said,</v>

188
00:07:42.261 --> 00:07:42.411
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

189
00:07:42.411 --> 00:07:44.570
<v Speaker 2>I'd like my dad and the dad involved,</v>

190
00:07:44.571 --> 00:07:45.770
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

191
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.550
<v Speaker 2>but when the.</v>

192
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:51.550
<v Speaker 2>But I started listening to the butts of the women and then listening to men who</v>

193
00:07:51.861 --> 00:07:52.160
<v Speaker 2>had,</v>

194
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:56.450
<v Speaker 2>wanted to be more involved with their children and listening to what the</v>

195
00:07:56.451 --> 00:07:58.460
<v Speaker 2>differences were between the mit,</v>

196
00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:00.500
<v Speaker 2>what made the men feel not wanted,</v>

197
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:05.660
<v Speaker 2>what made the men feel excluded and why the women felt that they needed to not</v>

198
00:08:05.661 --> 00:08:06.680
<v Speaker 2>have the man involved.</v>

199
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:11.950
<v Speaker 2>And I saw this entire set of misunderstandings here and if I hope the boy crisis</v>

200
00:08:12.291 --> 00:08:13.390
<v Speaker 2>does anything is so.</v>

201
00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:14.810
<v Speaker 2>It's just sort of explained,</v>

202
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:15.381
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

203
00:08:15.381 --> 00:08:19.220
<v Speaker 2>here are the 10 major things that Dad's do that,</v>

204
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:24.790
<v Speaker 2>that sort of annoy women or make women feel that they're not protecting their</v>

205
00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:26.180
<v Speaker 2>children adequately.</v>

206
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:30.890
<v Speaker 2>Which when they understand the purpose of these things and when dads get their</v>

207
00:08:30.891 --> 00:08:35.891
<v Speaker 2>homework done enough to articulate to the moms the purpose of these things that</v>

208
00:08:36.021 --> 00:08:37.220
<v Speaker 2>will realize that the,</v>

209
00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:37.730
<v Speaker 2>that the,</v>

210
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:40.550
<v Speaker 2>these are necessary ingredients in a child's life.</v>
