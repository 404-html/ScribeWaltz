1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.270
<v Speaker 1>My wife and I found out earlier in the year and we may not be able to have</v>

2
00:00:03.271 --> 00:00:03.960
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>

3
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.300
<v Speaker 1>Then last month I was diagnosed with cancer.</v>

4
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:08.080
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

5
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

6
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:10.990
<v Speaker 1>how do I combat depression?</v>

7
00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:11.951
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

8
00:00:11.951 --> 00:00:13.780
<v Speaker 1>the first thing that we should point out here,</v>

9
00:00:13.781 --> 00:00:15.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm very sorry to hear about all that.</v>

10
00:00:15.371 --> 00:00:15.780
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

11
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.060
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot of tragedy in a very short period of time.</v>

12
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.953
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

13
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:20.530
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

14
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.260
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not going to give you any casual advice because,</v>

15
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:24.340
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

16
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.080
<v Speaker 1>maybe I can make some things clearer.</v>

17
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.240
<v Speaker 1>The first is you're not depressed.</v>

18
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.640
<v Speaker 1>You've had terrible things happen to you.</v>

19
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.020
<v Speaker 1>That's not the same thing.</v>

20
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:33.250
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

21
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.000
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

22
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.320
<v Speaker 1>I distinguished between them.</v>

23
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.970
<v Speaker 1>If a client comes to me and they say they're feeling very sad and down and</v>

24
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.610
<v Speaker 1>anxious and worried about everything and so forth,</v>

25
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.350
<v Speaker 1>then I kind of walked through their life.</v>

26
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.060
<v Speaker 1>Do they have friends?</v>

27
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.110
<v Speaker 1>Do they have a family?</v>

28
00:00:47.111 --> 00:00:48.580
<v Speaker 1>Do they have a meaningful job?</v>

29
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:49.180
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

30
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.230
<v Speaker 1>is their educational background appropriate for their level of intelligence and</v>

31
00:00:53.231 --> 00:00:54.064
<v Speaker 1>ability?</v>

32
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.450
<v Speaker 1>Are they taking care of themselves?</v>

33
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.950
<v Speaker 1>Do they have something to look forward to?</v>

34
00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.220
<v Speaker 1>Did they use their time outside of work productively and wisely,</v>

35
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.881
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

36
00:01:00.881 --> 00:01:03.850
<v Speaker 1>So you think about those as the dimensions of a good life.</v>

37
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.433
<v Speaker 1>There's more,</v>

38
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:06.580
<v Speaker 1>or maybe there's fewer,</v>

39
00:01:06.581 --> 00:01:10.090
<v Speaker 1>but that's not too bad for a quick and dirty first pass through,</v>

40
00:01:10.091 --> 00:01:10.924
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

41
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:11.590
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

42
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:12.970
<v Speaker 1>those are the dimensions by the way,</v>

43
00:01:12.971 --> 00:01:13.900
<v Speaker 1>that you work on.</v>

44
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.500
<v Speaker 1>If you do the future authoring program in the self authoring suite,</v>

45
00:01:17.501 --> 00:01:21.640
<v Speaker 1>you're asked to think about all those dimensions and consider what your life</v>

46
00:01:21.641 --> 00:01:24.130
<v Speaker 1>might be like if you optimized along all of them.</v>

47
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.923
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

48
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.183
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

49
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.921
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

50
00:01:30.921 --> 00:01:34.550
<v Speaker 1>if all of those things are going well for you and you feel terrible all the</v>

51
00:01:34.551 --> 00:01:34.881
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

52
00:01:34.881 --> 00:01:36.080
<v Speaker 1>then you're depressed.</v>

53
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:37.650
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

54
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.410
<v Speaker 1>Cause there's,</v>

55
00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.720
<v Speaker 1>there's something wrong with your emotional regulation.</v>

56
00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:41.021
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

57
00:01:41.021 --> 00:01:41.261
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

58
00:01:41.261 --> 00:01:43.870
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're having an existential crisis that's a possibility,</v>

59
00:01:43.871 --> 00:01:44.710
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

60
00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.890
<v Speaker 1>let's assume we can't see anything structurally wrong with your life,</v>

61
00:01:47.891 --> 00:01:48.820
<v Speaker 1>but you're feeling terrible.</v>

62
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.871
<v Speaker 1>Then I would say,</v>

63
00:01:49.871 --> 00:01:50.560
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

64
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.430
<v Speaker 1>you have depression.</v>

65
00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.330
<v Speaker 1>There's something wrong.</v>

66
00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.000
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's physiological and people like that.</v>

67
00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:55.930
<v Speaker 1>In my experience,</v>

68
00:01:55.931 --> 00:01:58.540
<v Speaker 1>those are the people who often really benefit from antidepressants.</v>

69
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.050
<v Speaker 1>But then there's other sort of person who who is in trouble.</v>

70
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.760
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

71
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.593
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

72
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.433
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

73
00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.890
<v Speaker 1>their educational attainment is not what it should be.</v>

74
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.450
<v Speaker 1>They don't have a job.</v>

75
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.790
<v Speaker 1>They have an alcohol or drug problem.</v>

76
00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.780
<v Speaker 1>They have a family that's really not functioning well or they don't have a</v>

77
00:02:19.781 --> 00:02:20.614
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>

78
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.780
<v Speaker 1>Their immediate relationship,</v>

79
00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.480
<v Speaker 1>intimate relationship is nonexistent or terrible.</v>

80
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:26.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

81
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.030
<v Speaker 1>their friends are non existent or,</v>

82
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.083
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

83
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.750
<v Speaker 1>or worthless and,</v>

84
00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.160
<v Speaker 1>and destructive.</v>

85
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

86
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.020
<v Speaker 1>they don't get along with their relatives there in poor mental and physical</v>

87
00:02:38.021 --> 00:02:38.854
<v Speaker 1>health.</v>

88
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.200
<v Speaker 1>You get the picture that's,</v>

89
00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.430
<v Speaker 1>and they're not feeling good.</v>

90
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.040
<v Speaker 1>There are moods low and they're anxious.</v>

91
00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.270
<v Speaker 1>That's not depression.</v>

92
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:47.471
<v Speaker 1>Like it might be,</v>

93
00:02:47.471 --> 00:02:47.771
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

94
00:02:47.771 --> 00:02:48.580
<v Speaker 1>but it's a terror.</v>

95
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.211
<v Speaker 1>But what that is,</v>

96
00:02:49.211 --> 00:02:50.410
<v Speaker 1>is a terrible life.</v>

97
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:51.031
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

98
00:02:51.031 --> 00:02:52.990
<v Speaker 1>and those are different things they needed to be,</v>

99
00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.090
<v Speaker 1>they need to be conceptualized differently.</v>

100
00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.460
<v Speaker 1>Now even if you have a terrible life,</v>

101
00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.050
<v Speaker 1>an antidepressant might be able to lift you up enough so that you can keep</v>

102
00:03:02.051 --> 00:03:02.530
<v Speaker 1>fighting.</v>

103
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.951
<v Speaker 1>Let's say,</v>

104
00:03:02.951 --> 00:03:04.270
<v Speaker 1>assuming that that's what you're doing,</v>

105
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.800
<v Speaker 1>but an antidepressant obviously isn't going to help,</v>

106
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.720
<v Speaker 1>isn't going to remove the facts of your terrible life.</v>

107
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.611
<v Speaker 1>Now you,</v>

108
00:03:15.611 --> 00:03:18.980
<v Speaker 1>you've got terrible things happening to you at the moment and,</v>

109
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.090
<v Speaker 1>and there's no simple answer to that.</v>

110
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.160
<v Speaker 1>I would say you could,</v>

111
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.750
<v Speaker 1>you could take a look at chapter 12 in my book,</v>

112
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.280
<v Speaker 1>12 rules for life.</v>

113
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.950
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

114
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.370
<v Speaker 1>it's called a pet,</v>

115
00:03:33.371 --> 00:03:35.500
<v Speaker 1>a cat when you encounter one on the street.</v>

116
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.490
<v Speaker 1>And in part it's a,</v>

117
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.410
<v Speaker 1>it's an autobiography I autobiographical chapter about how my wife and I and my</v>

118
00:03:41.411 --> 00:03:41.861
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>

119
00:03:41.861 --> 00:03:42.190
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

120
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.450
<v Speaker 1>my son and daughter and my,</v>

121
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.700
<v Speaker 1>my extended family as well dealt with my daughter's extremely serious illness</v>

122
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:49.390
<v Speaker 1>while she,</v>

123
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:50.223
<v Speaker 1>it's still,</v>

124
00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.330
<v Speaker 1>it's still plagues are to some degree,</v>

125
00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:53.920
<v Speaker 1>although not nearly as much as it did.</v>

126
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.120
<v Speaker 1>She was very seriously ill when she was a teenager and a,</v>

127
00:03:58.121 --> 00:04:00.280
<v Speaker 1>it was an ongoing crisis,</v>

128
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.670
<v Speaker 1>a continual for years of crisis.</v>

129
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.960
<v Speaker 1>And so the question is how do you cope with that?</v>

130
00:04:07.961 --> 00:04:10.000
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is,</v>

131
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.260
<v Speaker 1>the first answer is you shrink your timeframe.</v>

132
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:15.573
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

133
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:17.770
<v Speaker 1>you've had these,</v>

134
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.380
<v Speaker 1>especially with regards to your diagnosis.</v>

135
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:21.243
<v Speaker 1>So like</v>

136
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.620
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden your future has been thrown completely into chaos and</v>

137
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.930
<v Speaker 1>you don't know how to deal with that.</v>

138
00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.940
<v Speaker 1>And who would you do what you can to stabilize your medical treatment and to</v>

139
00:04:37.361 --> 00:04:39.580
<v Speaker 1>optimize your quality of life while that's happening.</v>

140
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.440
<v Speaker 1>Very complicated thing to do.</v>

141
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.260
<v Speaker 1>And then I would say you live for the day,</v>

142
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:45.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

143
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.420
<v Speaker 1>for the week maybe,</v>

144
00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:48.550
<v Speaker 1>maybe a week's too much even,</v>

145
00:04:48.551 --> 00:04:51.850
<v Speaker 1>but for the day it's like you get up in the morning,</v>

146
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.180
<v Speaker 1>you think I need to do everything I can to make this day as meaningful and and</v>

147
00:05:00.071 --> 00:05:01.780
<v Speaker 1>rich as I possibly can.</v>

148
00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.860
<v Speaker 1>And hopefully I will have had a full day by this evening and then I'll be able</v>

149
00:05:08.561 --> 00:05:11.800
<v Speaker 1>to sleep and then I'll be able to get up in the morning and say,</v>

150
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try to make this day as useful and meaningful and engaging as it</v>

151
00:05:18.491 --> 00:05:19.324
<v Speaker 1>can be.</v>

152
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.520
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe when you're really sick,</v>

153
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:22.361
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a day,</v>

154
00:05:22.361 --> 00:05:24.940
<v Speaker 1>you have hours and then you do the same thing for the hours.</v>

155
00:05:24.941 --> 00:05:27.070
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe you do the same thing with the minutes.</v>

156
00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.290
<v Speaker 1>I would also say,</v>

157
00:05:32.291 --> 00:05:32.531
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

158
00:05:32.531 --> 00:05:37.180
<v Speaker 1>you've been through a lot of shock and it's conceivable that you might need to</v>

159
00:05:37.181 --> 00:05:38.014
<v Speaker 1>talk to someone.</v>

160
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:41.500
<v Speaker 1>It's also conceivable that an antidepressant could help you,</v>

161
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:42.701
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

162
00:05:42.701 --> 00:05:47.050
<v Speaker 1>you've got a lot to deal with and you might need your nervous system might need</v>

163
00:05:47.051 --> 00:05:49.510
<v Speaker 1>some stabilization with all that stress.</v>

164
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.120
<v Speaker 1>And so that's something to consider.</v>

165
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.690
<v Speaker 1>Antidepressants are also quite effective as pain medications,</v>

166
00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:56.860
<v Speaker 1>especially a drug called.</v>

167
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.300
<v Speaker 1>So that's also worth knowing because you need to know about effective pain</v>

168
00:06:02.301 --> 00:06:03.134
<v Speaker 1>medication.</v>

169
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.370
<v Speaker 1>It's very important,</v>

170
00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:05.270
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

171
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.180
<v Speaker 1>in extreme situations of pain.</v>

172
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.090
<v Speaker 1>Opiates of course are the drug of choice,</v>

173
00:06:11.091 --> 00:06:14.600
<v Speaker 1>but you could use drugs like methylphenidate,</v>

174
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:15.291
<v Speaker 1>Ritalin,</v>

175
00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:16.910
<v Speaker 1>the Adhd drug,</v>

176
00:06:16.911 --> 00:06:18.650
<v Speaker 1>you can use them as adjuncts to,</v>

177
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.000
<v Speaker 1>to pain medication.</v>

178
00:06:20.001 --> 00:06:22.010
<v Speaker 1>And people need to know that because the,</v>

179
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.911
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

180
00:06:22.911 --> 00:06:23.744
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

181
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.430
<v Speaker 1>there basically amphetamines,</v>

182
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:28.370
<v Speaker 1>amphetamines have analgesic properties,</v>

183
00:06:28.371 --> 00:06:29.210
<v Speaker 1>but they also keep,</v>

184
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.300
<v Speaker 1>they also maintain alertness.</v>

185
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.910
<v Speaker 1>And so the problem with opiates is they can be sedating,</v>

186
00:06:34.911 --> 00:06:37.280
<v Speaker 1>but an opiate amphetamine combination.</v>

187
00:06:37.281 --> 00:06:40.220
<v Speaker 1>And this is for people who are in absolutely intractable pain,</v>

188
00:06:40.221 --> 00:06:41.054
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

189
00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.973
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

190
00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.770
<v Speaker 1>that can increase alertness and help cope with pain.</v>

191
00:06:45.771 --> 00:06:49.430
<v Speaker 1>And it's really useful to know what you might need to cope with pain.</v>

192
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:55.300
<v Speaker 1>So I would say shrink your time horizon and then,</v>

193
00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:00.181
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

194
00:07:00.181 --> 00:07:01.014
<v Speaker 2>thank you.</v>

195
00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:05.520
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

196
00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:06.353
<v Speaker 1>thanks Tim.</v>

197
00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:14.580
<v Speaker 1>Shrink your time horizon and then concentrate on the</v>

198
00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:18.300
<v Speaker 1>concentrate on the moment.</v>

199
00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.100
<v Speaker 1>Whatever that moment happens to be,</v>

200
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.300
<v Speaker 1>might be the next minute,</v>

201
00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:22.050
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

202
00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:27.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what else to do when you're in an extreme situation.</v>

203
00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:28.381
<v Speaker 1>The other thing,</v>

204
00:07:28.381 --> 00:07:30.780
<v Speaker 1>I guess the final thing I would say with regards to the,</v>

205
00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:33.750
<v Speaker 1>we may not have be able to have children.</v>

206
00:07:33.751 --> 00:07:33.991
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

207
00:07:33.991 --> 00:07:38.100
<v Speaker 1>you need a plan to address that to the best that that you can to the best way</v>

208
00:07:38.101 --> 00:07:38.701
<v Speaker 1>that you can.</v>

209
00:07:38.701 --> 00:07:43.020
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to give yourself some time to reconceptualize your life and</v>

210
00:07:43.021 --> 00:07:43.501
<v Speaker 1>your future.</v>

211
00:07:43.501 --> 00:07:44.640
<v Speaker 1>And I would say news,</v>

212
00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:49.340
<v Speaker 1>like we may not be able to have children that probably takes about a year or</v>

213
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:50.790
<v Speaker 1>year and a half to digest.</v>

214
00:07:50.791 --> 00:07:54.150
<v Speaker 1>So don't be too hard on yourself if you haven't figured it out yet.</v>

215
00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.030
<v Speaker 1>It's any major life transformation,</v>

216
00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.010
<v Speaker 1>like a really major life transformation.</v>

217
00:07:59.011 --> 00:08:01.660
<v Speaker 1>I would say it takes a minimum of a year to really adapt to.</v>
