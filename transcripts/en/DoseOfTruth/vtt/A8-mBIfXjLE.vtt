1
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:11.350
<v Speaker 1>Can you talk about your own specific experiences slash methods used with</v>

2
00:00:11.351 --> 00:00:12.550
<v Speaker 1>integrating the shadow?</v>

3
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:14.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4
00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.020
<v Speaker 1>Well I can actually,</v>

5
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.870
<v Speaker 1>I think a tremendous amount of what you might regard as shadow integration,</v>

6
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.110
<v Speaker 1>which in the parlance of behavioral psychologists would be something like</v>

7
00:00:30.151 --> 00:00:31.380
<v Speaker 1>assertiveness training,</v>

8
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

9
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.280
<v Speaker 1>It's training and how to stand up for yourself and for your,</v>

10
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.290
<v Speaker 1>let's say for your better self,</v>

11
00:00:37.291 --> 00:00:42.291
<v Speaker 1>which would be the self that you could use productively over a medium to long</v>

12
00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:45.060
<v Speaker 1>period of time that would be of use to you,</v>

13
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.980
<v Speaker 1>but also views to people around you.</v>

14
00:00:46.981 --> 00:00:51.981
<v Speaker 1>So it's a self that's owned by the necessity of taking care of yourself,</v>

15
00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:55.440
<v Speaker 1>but also simultaneously taking care of the people around you.</v>

16
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.933
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

17
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.910
<v Speaker 1>I think that the simplest way to start that work is to consult your resentment.</v>

18
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.800
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

19
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.800
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to become bitter about life and to become angry because of course life</v>

20
00:01:13.561 --> 00:01:16.410
<v Speaker 1>is difficult and it's full of disappointments and</v>

21
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.600
<v Speaker 1>people are also subject to be trail on the part of themselves and on the part of</v>

22
00:01:21.601 --> 00:01:23.310
<v Speaker 1>people that hypothetically care for them.</v>

23
00:01:23.311 --> 00:01:28.311
<v Speaker 1>And so it's easy to get bitter and to be resentful and resentment is a very</v>

24
00:01:28.861 --> 00:01:31.620
<v Speaker 1>useful emotion even though I think it's one of the most,</v>

25
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

26
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.910
<v Speaker 1>damaging emotions if it's not dealt with properly.</v>

27
00:01:35.911 --> 00:01:40.710
<v Speaker 1>So if you're resentful basically means only one of two things,</v>

28
00:01:40.711 --> 00:01:44.940
<v Speaker 1>it either means you should grow up and quit whining and get on with your life.</v>

29
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.210
<v Speaker 1>Or it means that you're being subject to tyrannical forces of one form or</v>

30
00:01:51.181 --> 00:01:52.920
<v Speaker 1>another maybe emanating from you.</v>

31
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.140
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a consequence of the natural environment,</v>

32
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.790
<v Speaker 1>maybe a consequence of society.</v>

33
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
<v Speaker 1>You're being subjected to radical forces and you're not putting your own best</v>

34
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.890
<v Speaker 1>interests forward.</v>

35
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.110
<v Speaker 1>Like in that broader sense that I described.</v>

36
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.790
<v Speaker 1>And I don't mean you're selfish,</v>

37
00:02:08.791 --> 00:02:13.791
<v Speaker 1>narrow interests that only serve the purposes of instantaneous gratification.</v>

38
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean your own best interest in terms of developing your character over the</v>

39
00:02:17.851 --> 00:02:18.840
<v Speaker 1>span of your life.</v>

40
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.820
<v Speaker 1>If you're resentful,</v>

41
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.780
<v Speaker 1>it either means that you're immature and that you should grow the hell up.</v>

42
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.620
<v Speaker 1>And so you need to figure out how much of your resentment is,</v>

43
00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:28.330
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

44
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.000
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>

45
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.690
<v Speaker 1>and maybe the allied with the desire to find other things or people to blame.</v>

46
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.140
<v Speaker 1>But the other possible option is that you have something to say or do,</v>

47
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.901
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

48
00:02:39.901 --> 00:02:44.901
<v Speaker 1>Because you're in a situation where you're violating your own internal ethical</v>

49
00:02:45.301 --> 00:02:48.750
<v Speaker 1>standards and you're being required pressure,</v>

50
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.650
<v Speaker 1>let's say to say things you don't believe or to do things that you believe to be</v>

51
00:02:52.651 --> 00:02:56.250
<v Speaker 1>wrong and you need to determine,</v>

52
00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.910
<v Speaker 1>you need to start to strategize and plan how can rectify that so that you can</v>

53
00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:01.840
<v Speaker 1>say what you mean.</v>

54
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.420
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're negotiating with a marital partner for example,</v>

55
00:03:04.421 --> 00:03:08.980
<v Speaker 1>and there are issues in your marriage that aren't making you happy.</v>

56
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.500
<v Speaker 1>While the first thing is you have to take note of that,</v>

57
00:03:11.501 --> 00:03:11.711
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

58
00:03:11.711 --> 00:03:13.390
<v Speaker 1>To see that you're actually unhappy.</v>

59
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.170
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

60
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.560
<v Speaker 1>the second is that you have to be willing to engage in a certain amount of</v>

61
00:03:17.561 --> 00:03:21.130
<v Speaker 1>conflict because in order to sort out what's disturbing you,</v>

62
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.150
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to allay your concerns out on the table and say,</v>

63
00:03:25.151 --> 00:03:25.571
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>

64
00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:26.440
<v Speaker 1>this is bothering me.</v>

65
00:03:26.441 --> 00:03:27.131
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to say,</v>

66
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:27.610
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

67
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm right and you're wrong and you have to fix this.</v>

68
00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:31.331
<v Speaker 1>You have to say,</v>

69
00:03:31.331 --> 00:03:31.750
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

70
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.730
<v Speaker 1>I've noticed that this</v>

71
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.230
<v Speaker 1>pattern of interaction or lack of interactions say in our relationship is making</v>

72
00:03:40.931 --> 00:03:42.640
<v Speaker 1>me resentful and angry,</v>

73
00:03:42.641 --> 00:03:43.750
<v Speaker 1>and the danger of that,</v>

74
00:03:43.751 --> 00:03:44.111
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

75
00:03:44.111 --> 00:03:46.360
<v Speaker 1>as you're going to take it out on yourself and your partner,</v>

76
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.040
<v Speaker 1>the Dangerous Passion,</v>

77
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.450
<v Speaker 1>passive aggressiveness,</v>

78
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:50.021
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

79
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:52.780
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to respond to your partner positively when they do something</v>

80
00:03:52.781 --> 00:03:53.021
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

81
00:03:53.021 --> 00:03:56.890
<v Speaker 1>if you're resentful about them and you're not going to respond to yourself</v>

82
00:03:56.891 --> 00:03:57.351
<v Speaker 1>properly,</v>

83
00:03:57.351 --> 00:03:58.690
<v Speaker 1>and so you have to lay it out on the table,</v>

84
00:03:58.691 --> 00:04:00.840
<v Speaker 1>but sort of in a spirit of ignorance,</v>

85
00:04:00.841 --> 00:04:01.674
<v Speaker 1>humility,</v>

86
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.991
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

87
00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:02.800
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

88
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm frustrated.</v>

89
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm feeling this way about our relationship.</v>

90
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.860
<v Speaker 1>Here's what I think might be going wrong,</v>

91
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.660
<v Speaker 1>maybe on my part and maybe on your part and here's what I envision as a possible</v>

92
00:04:13.661 --> 00:04:14.410
<v Speaker 1>solution.</v>

93
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:15.970
<v Speaker 1>That's also really necessary.</v>

94
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.970
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to say what you have to say,</v>

95
00:04:18.971 --> 00:04:21.280
<v Speaker 1>which is to manifest yourself properly in the world,</v>

96
00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:24.250
<v Speaker 1>is you can't just complain about what's wrong.</v>

97
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.360
<v Speaker 1>You have to think,</v>

98
00:04:25.361 --> 00:04:25.511
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

99
00:04:25.511 --> 00:04:28.930
<v Speaker 1>what would my minimal preconditions for satisfaction B,</v>

100
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.140
<v Speaker 1>you have to offer that to the person that you're negotiating with.</v>

101
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.800
<v Speaker 1>And so then you learn to abide by the truth to the degree that you can do that</v>

102
00:04:38.441 --> 00:04:39.730
<v Speaker 1>and no one does it perfectly,</v>

103
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.780
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

104
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:41.850
<v Speaker 1>But it,</v>

105
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:47.090
<v Speaker 1>it's very useful because you're not storing up a whole sequence of memories</v>

106
00:04:49.391 --> 00:04:53.170
<v Speaker 1>about how you were unfairly treated and abused and betrayed.</v>

107
00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:54.071
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

108
00:04:54.071 --> 00:04:57.670
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to stay on top of it and to note your unhappiness and</v>

109
00:04:57.671 --> 00:05:02.671
<v Speaker 1>dissatisfaction when it manifests itself and to accept that that's the case.</v>

110
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.770
<v Speaker 1>And then to analyze that to see if it's your problem.</v>

111
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:06.431
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

112
00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:11.431
<v Speaker 1>with regards to maturity or if it indicates that there's an injustice in the</v>

113
00:05:11.651 --> 00:05:16.390
<v Speaker 1>manner in which you and the world are interacting and then to work to set that</v>

114
00:05:16.391 --> 00:05:17.920
<v Speaker 1>right even in small ways.</v>

115
00:05:17.921 --> 00:05:19.140
<v Speaker 1>And so it's,</v>

116
00:05:19.141 --> 00:05:20.350
<v Speaker 1>it's a matter of character,</v>

117
00:05:20.351 --> 00:05:22.210
<v Speaker 1>logical development and that makes you,</v>

118
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.450
<v Speaker 1>that makes you stronger over time.</v>

119
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.250
<v Speaker 1>And partly what you need,</v>

120
00:05:27.251 --> 00:05:27.461
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

121
00:05:27.461 --> 00:05:29.800
<v Speaker 1>in order to do that is you have to really understand,</v>

122
00:05:29.801 --> 00:05:31.000
<v Speaker 1>and we do this,</v>

123
00:05:31.001 --> 00:05:33.520
<v Speaker 1>this is why we built in the future authoring program.</v>

124
00:05:33.521 --> 00:05:37.660
<v Speaker 1>We built the section where you have to outline your most dismal future,</v>

125
00:05:37.661 --> 00:05:37.961
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

126
00:05:37.961 --> 00:05:41.300
<v Speaker 1>What your future would be like if you let all your bad habits and character,</v>

127
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:43.480
<v Speaker 1>logical weaknesses have the upper hand.</v>

128
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.700
<v Speaker 1>And the reason we did this is because you can't be a,</v>

129
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.630
<v Speaker 1>you can't straighten yourself out merely as a consequence of hope.</v>

130
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.810
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you lay out a vision for the future and you think about what your life</v>

131
00:05:55.811 --> 00:05:56.644
<v Speaker 1>would be,</v>

132
00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.280
<v Speaker 1>what you'd like your life to be like,</v>

133
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.100
<v Speaker 1>and then that makes you hopeful and it motivates you because it gives you</v>

134
00:06:01.101 --> 00:06:04.280
<v Speaker 1>something worthwhile and higher order to work for.</v>

135
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:05.300
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

136
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.111
<v Speaker 1>And that's useful.</v>

137
00:06:06.111 --> 00:06:10.070
<v Speaker 1>That's positive emotion working for you because positive emotion is experienced</v>

138
00:06:10.071 --> 00:06:11.180
<v Speaker 1>in relationship to goals,</v>

139
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.800
<v Speaker 1>but it's not as not as useful as also being chased by something you're terrified</v>

140
00:06:15.801 --> 00:06:16.634
<v Speaker 1>by.</v>

141
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.110
<v Speaker 1>And if you have a good sense of how you'd fall apart if you stayed week and just</v>

142
00:06:21.111 --> 00:06:23.240
<v Speaker 1>exactly what kind of hell that would be.</v>

143
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.920
<v Speaker 1>Then when you determined to do something like to tell the truth and to say what</v>

144
00:06:27.921 --> 00:06:30.380
<v Speaker 1>you think and to not do things that you hate,</v>

145
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.330
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to be pulled along by the purpose that your vision has</v>

146
00:06:35.331 --> 00:06:36.141
<v Speaker 1>provided for you,</v>

147
00:06:36.141 --> 00:06:40.760
<v Speaker 1>but also pushed along by your desire to avoid the worst forms of hell that</v>

148
00:06:40.761 --> 00:06:42.920
<v Speaker 1>you've already outlined for yourself personally.</v>

149
00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:48.440
<v Speaker 1>And that can also help you be brave enough to stand up in a situation that we</v>

150
00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:49.820
<v Speaker 1>would require a conflict.</v>

151
00:06:49.821 --> 00:06:54.821
<v Speaker 1>Because if you have something to say and you have something to negotiate about</v>

152
00:06:55.131 --> 00:06:55.964
<v Speaker 1>with someone,</v>

153
00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:00.800
<v Speaker 1>then there's going to be a certain amount of conflictual dialogue that</v>

154
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:05.980
<v Speaker 1>accompanies that right it to lay out a set of problems and to describe the fact</v>

155
00:07:06.951 --> 00:07:10.880
<v Speaker 1>forthrightly that those problems characterize a relationship and then to seek</v>

156
00:07:10.881 --> 00:07:15.800
<v Speaker 1>for solutions is quite stressful in the short term and it's really easy to</v>

157
00:07:15.801 --> 00:07:16.221
<v Speaker 1>avoid.</v>

158
00:07:16.221 --> 00:07:20.810
<v Speaker 1>And so people avoided all the time and then they store up grievances across the</v>

159
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:25.100
<v Speaker 1>span of the relationships and eventually the grievances mount to the point where</v>

160
00:07:25.101 --> 00:07:28.730
<v Speaker 1>they return in monstrous form and just eat everything up.</v>

161
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:32.540
<v Speaker 1>That's where you get divorces or that's where you explode at your boss and ended</v>

162
00:07:32.541 --> 00:07:34.250
<v Speaker 1>up fired or that's where you,</v>

163
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:34.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

164
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:38.690
<v Speaker 1>you develop high blood pressure over 15 years because he can't stand all the</v>

165
00:07:38.691 --> 00:07:39.524
<v Speaker 1>accumulated,</v>

166
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:40.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

167
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:41.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

168
00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:45.980
<v Speaker 1>Monse all the accumulated monsters in your closet and then you drink yourself</v>

169
00:07:45.981 --> 00:07:48.230
<v Speaker 1>into oblivion because he can't stand your life.</v>

170
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:49.483
<v Speaker 1>That's all,</v>

171
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:50.361
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

172
00:07:50.361 --> 00:07:51.620
<v Speaker 1>very counterproductive.</v>

173
00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:56.270
<v Speaker 1>But it's easy to avoid that necessary conflict on a moment to moment basis</v>

174
00:07:56.271 --> 00:08:01.271
<v Speaker 1>because it's very stressful to speak forthrightly about genuine conflicts.</v>

175
00:08:01.551 --> 00:08:04.040
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you're dealing with important parts of your life,</v>

176
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.170
<v Speaker 1>but otherwise you don't straighten them out.</v>

177
00:08:06.171 --> 00:08:07.970
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to carry all that forward.</v>

178
00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:12.590
<v Speaker 1>So you need to be terrified of the consequences of not speaking your piece.</v>

179
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.790
<v Speaker 1>And that can counterbalance the terror of actually trying to have a</v>

180
00:08:16.791 --> 00:08:17.630
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

181
00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:18.590
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
