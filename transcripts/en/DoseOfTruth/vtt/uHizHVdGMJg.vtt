1
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.860
<v Speaker 1>And so not only do you need the value</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure so that you don't just</v>

2
00:00:09.861 --> 00:00:12.710
<v Speaker 1>deteriorate and die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need the value structure so that</v>

3
00:00:12.711 --> 00:00:16.250
<v Speaker 1>when the flood comes in your life as it</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly will,</v>

4
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.430
<v Speaker 1>that you have built a vessel that will</v>
<v Speaker 1>sustain you through the catastrophe and</v>

5
00:00:21.471 --> 00:00:26.360
<v Speaker 1>that's not this pursuit of happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even the pursuit of security.</v>

6
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.370
<v Speaker 1>It's none of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the orientation that you've managed</v>

7
00:00:31.371 --> 00:00:35.690
<v Speaker 1>to produce in your own life towards a</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher good that's so high that it's</v>

8
00:00:35.691 --> 00:00:38.930
<v Speaker 1>worth bearing the burden of being to</v>
<v Speaker 1>produce.</v>

9
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.800
<v Speaker 1>You implement that in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You produce a hierarchy.</v>

10
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:44.930
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

11
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.890
<v Speaker 1>and then you have the problem of</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy in the problem of hierarchy is</v>

12
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.270
<v Speaker 1>a very few people are going to be very</v>
<v Speaker 1>good at whatever that hierarchy does and</v>

13
00:00:53.271 --> 00:00:55.490
<v Speaker 1>then you have the second problem with</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

14
00:00:55.491 --> 00:00:59.570
<v Speaker 1>which is the problem I just laid out</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I asked you about your spectacular</v>

15
00:00:59.571 --> 00:01:02.960
<v Speaker 1>levels of attainment and found out that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were very,</v>

16
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:04.850
<v Speaker 1>it was very unlikely.</v>

17
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that you haven't detained</v>
<v Speaker 1>worthwhile things.</v>

18
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.440
<v Speaker 1>That's not my point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My point is,</v>

19
00:01:09.441 --> 00:01:13.220
<v Speaker 1>is that very high levels of attainment</v>
<v Speaker 1>are extraordinarily rare.</v>

20
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.850
<v Speaker 1>And that's an inevitability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you decide that something's</v>

21
00:01:16.851 --> 00:01:21.620
<v Speaker 1>worth doing to inevitabilities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people stack up at the top minority of</v>

22
00:01:21.621 --> 00:01:24.740
<v Speaker 1>people stack up at the top and take most</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the proceeds,</v>

23
00:01:24.741 --> 00:01:27.620
<v Speaker 1>whatever they happen to be or deserve</v>
<v Speaker 1>them or earn them,</v>

24
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:28.701
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

25
00:01:28.701 --> 00:01:32.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't care how you conceptualize it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and almost everybody else stacks up at</v>

26
00:01:32.541 --> 00:01:35.960
<v Speaker 1>the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the problem with hierarchies is</v>

27
00:01:35.961 --> 00:01:39.350
<v Speaker 1>that even though they're necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tend to produce a situation where</v>

28
00:01:39.351 --> 00:01:43.640
<v Speaker 1>most people stack up at the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the next thing that we</v>

29
00:01:43.641 --> 00:01:46.610
<v Speaker 1>have to contend with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't get rid of the hierarchies</v>

30
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.350
<v Speaker 1>because if you get rid of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies,</v>

31
00:01:48.351 --> 00:01:50.960
<v Speaker 1>there's no value structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if there's no value structure,</v>

32
00:01:50.961 --> 00:01:55.280
<v Speaker 1>not only do you deteriorate and die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to deteriorate and die,</v>

33
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.740
<v Speaker 1>and that's not a good solution.</v>

34
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.520
<v Speaker 1>But if you do generate a hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have the problem of the</v>

35
00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:04.610
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the problem is the hierarchy is that</v>

36
00:02:04.611 --> 00:02:09.290
<v Speaker 1>it will dispossess most people now to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the degree that the postmodernists have</v>

37
00:02:09.291 --> 00:02:12.980
<v Speaker 1>something to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what they say is hierarchies.</v>

38
00:02:12.981 --> 00:02:16.970
<v Speaker 1>Dispossess okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we can look at that clearly and</v>

39
00:02:16.971 --> 00:02:21.110
<v Speaker 1>carefully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we can say that doesn't mean a,</v>

40
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.670
<v Speaker 1>that hierarchies themselves are corrupt</v>
<v Speaker 1>or that we can dispense with them.</v>

41
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.500
<v Speaker 1>But it also doesn't mean that we have no</v>
<v Speaker 1>moral obligation to the dispossessed.</v>

42
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.761
<v Speaker 1>And we say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

43
00:02:31.761 --> 00:02:35.480
<v Speaker 1>how do we deal with that politically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptually.</v>

44
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.370
<v Speaker 1>And the way we deal with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in part,</v>

45
00:02:37.371 --> 00:02:41.990
<v Speaker 1>is to produce a political spectrum that</v>
<v Speaker 1>ranges from left to right that deals</v>

46
00:02:41.991 --> 00:02:45.500
<v Speaker 1>with hierarchy and the problems that</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies because so one of the things</v>

47
00:02:45.501 --> 00:02:50.501
<v Speaker 1>that you can reliably assume about</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's on the right is that they</v>

48
00:02:50.991 --> 00:02:55.991
<v Speaker 1>will be patriotically in favor of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>current hierarchy or even more</v>

49
00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.180
<v Speaker 1>abstractly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in favor.</v>

50
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.710
<v Speaker 1>The idea of hierarchy itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you say,</v>

51
00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:04.390
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more power to the people on the right</v>

52
00:03:04.391 --> 00:03:08.860
<v Speaker 1>because you need hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they should support them.</v>

53
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.170
<v Speaker 1>But then you have to take the people on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the left who say,</v>

54
00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:13.390
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what about the people who are</v>

55
00:03:13.391 --> 00:03:16.690
<v Speaker 1>dispossessed by the hierarchy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what you have to say to them is,</v>

56
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.630
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we actually have to do something about</v>

57
00:03:19.631 --> 00:03:20.800
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>

58
00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:22.390
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did we do something about that?</v>

59
00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:27.391
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is we don't actually know</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's no permanent solution to</v>

60
00:03:27.551 --> 00:03:30.310
<v Speaker 1>the problem of dispossession by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>

61
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.090
<v Speaker 1>We don't know how to fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

62
00:03:34.091 --> 00:03:35.440
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could flatten the hierarchies.</v>

63
00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:38.290
<v Speaker 1>It's like not without disrupting the</v>
<v Speaker 1>value structure.</v>

64
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.440
<v Speaker 1>That's a price you don't want to pay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

65
00:03:41.441 --> 00:03:43.600
<v Speaker 1>we could take from the top and put it at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom.</v>

66
00:03:43.601 --> 00:03:46.780
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

67
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.180
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically we could.</v>

68
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.180
<v Speaker 1>But it turns out that when you try that</v>
<v Speaker 1>in practice,</v>

69
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.050
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very easy to rapidly go too far.</v>

70
00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.370
<v Speaker 1>And then what you end up with not is</v>
<v Speaker 1>less dispossessed.</v>

71
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.730
<v Speaker 1>You end up with no one who has anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not a good solution to the</v>

72
00:04:06.491 --> 00:04:09.250
<v Speaker 1>problem of scarcity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

73
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.870
<v Speaker 1>To make everyone equally dead or equally</v>
<v Speaker 1>starving,</v>

74
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.220
<v Speaker 1>which is essentially what the communists</v>
<v Speaker 1>states did across the entirety of the</v>

75
00:04:18.221 --> 00:04:23.221
<v Speaker 1>20th century is not the proper way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>address the problem of hierarchy.</v>

76
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.400
<v Speaker 1>Now it has to be addressed even if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on the right because here's one</v>

77
00:04:27.401 --> 00:04:30.910
<v Speaker 1>thing that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hierarchies tend to Ossify,</v>

78
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because what happens is that the people</v>

79
00:04:33.251 --> 00:04:35.500
<v Speaker 1>at the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they got there by merit,</v>

80
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.580
<v Speaker 1>but it's easy for them to Gerrymander</v>
<v Speaker 1>the system so they can stay there</v>

81
00:04:39.581 --> 00:04:42.730
<v Speaker 1>without merit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or perhaps their children can stay there</v>

82
00:04:42.731 --> 00:04:47.140
<v Speaker 1>without merit or they can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the hierarchy becomes corrupt so that</v>

83
00:04:47.141 --> 00:04:50.080
<v Speaker 1>people who only use tyranny and power</v>
<v Speaker 1>can climate,</v>

84
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.380
<v Speaker 1>and so you don't have a hierarchy of</v>
<v Speaker 1>competence and value anymore.</v>

85
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.890
<v Speaker 1>You have a hierarchy of brute power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which looks like a tyranny,</v>

86
00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.520
<v Speaker 1>and so there's all sorts of ways that</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies can deteriorate and we have</v>

87
00:05:00.521 --> 00:05:03.370
<v Speaker 1>to be awake to ensure that that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>occur.</v>

88
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.930
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the hierarchy gets so steep that</v>

89
00:05:07.931 --> 00:05:10.810
<v Speaker 1>everybody stacks up at zero and no one</v>
<v Speaker 1>can climb it,</v>

90
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.980
<v Speaker 1>which is basically the definition of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>malfunctioning tyranny than all the</v>

91
00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:17.740
<v Speaker 1>people at the bottom rightly think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

92
00:05:17.741 --> 00:05:21.730
<v Speaker 1>why don't we just destroyed the game</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're already at zero?</v>

93
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:25.630
<v Speaker 1>So what the hell do we have to lose?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that you want</v>

94
00:05:25.631 --> 00:05:29.620
<v Speaker 1>to do if you're a sensible conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is make sure that the hierarchy</v>

95
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.480
<v Speaker 1>maintains its rooting in competence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's transparent and that it's</v>

96
00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.260
<v Speaker 1>climate bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because otherwise it will also Phi and</v>

97
00:05:38.261 --> 00:05:43.261
<v Speaker 1>steepen and then it will destroy itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're a conservative and you</v>

98
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.560
<v Speaker 1>value stability and the hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you don't want to set up a</v>

99
00:05:47.561 --> 00:05:51.520
<v Speaker 1>situation where the most likely outcome</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the hierarchy destroys itself.</v>

100
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.940
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we can be intelligent about this.</v>

101
00:05:54.941 --> 00:05:55.780
<v Speaker 1>We could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

102
00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.780
<v Speaker 1>don't be thinking can get rid of</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies they've been around.</v>

103
00:05:59.781 --> 00:06:02.390
<v Speaker 1>This is why I wrote chapter one I talked</v>
<v Speaker 1>about lobsters.</v>

104
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:08.230
<v Speaker 1>The reason I talked about them is</v>
<v Speaker 1>because not only is the hierarchical</v>

105
00:06:08.811 --> 00:06:12.260
<v Speaker 1>structure itself as a permanent feature</v>
<v Speaker 1>of existence,</v>

106
00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:17.410
<v Speaker 1>at least a third of a billion years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which by the way means that you cannot</v>

107
00:06:18.351 --> 00:06:22.520
<v Speaker 1>attribute it to capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the free market or the corrupt</v>

108
00:06:22.521 --> 00:06:25.670
<v Speaker 1>patriarchal west,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you're willing to make the case</v>

109
00:06:25.671 --> 00:06:29.690
<v Speaker 1>that all three of those elements</v>
<v Speaker 1>contributed to the existence of</v>

110
00:06:29.691 --> 00:06:33.980
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchies among crustaceans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which seems highly unlikely.</v>

111
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.970
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

112
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.900
<v Speaker 1>and this is actually something that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can think about it as an idea</v>

113
00:06:38.901 --> 00:06:42.410
<v Speaker 1>that's actually directed towards the</v>
<v Speaker 1>productive left.</v>

114
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:48.100
<v Speaker 1>If you want to help the dispossessed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't blame the existence of hierarchies</v>

115
00:06:48.471 --> 00:06:51.380
<v Speaker 1>on capitalism because it's wrong.</v>

116
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.160
<v Speaker 1>It's wrong that the problem is way</v>
<v Speaker 1>deeper than that.</v>

117
00:06:55.161 --> 00:06:58.070
<v Speaker 1>And here's something else that's very</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting about capitalism.</v>

118
00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.220
<v Speaker 1>Couple of things you might consider,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

119
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:05.300
<v Speaker 1>we have become spectacularly wealthy</v>
<v Speaker 1>since 1895 right?</v>

120
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.690
<v Speaker 1>First in the West Icelands at classic</v>
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

121
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:11.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean you guys are so much more wealthy</v>
<v Speaker 1>than you were a hundred years ago that</v>

122
00:07:11.871 --> 00:07:15.860
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely impossible to believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's first happened in the west</v>

123
00:07:15.861 --> 00:07:20.030
<v Speaker 1>to exponential economic growth starting</v>
<v Speaker 1>in about 1895 there's a long tail.</v>

124
00:07:20.031 --> 00:07:21.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were improving before that,</v>

125
00:07:21.651 --> 00:07:25.730
<v Speaker 1>but it really kicked in around 1895 and</v>
<v Speaker 1>first happened in the west and now it's</v>

126
00:07:25.731 --> 00:07:28.250
<v Speaker 1>happening everywhere in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know this,</v>

127
00:07:28.251 --> 00:07:30.050
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

128
00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:35.240
<v Speaker 1>the UN set a goal in 2000 to have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>level of absolute poverty in the world</v>

129
00:07:35.241 --> 00:07:40.241
<v Speaker 1>by 2015 which is the fastest rate of</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic growth ever recorded.</v>

130
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:45.020
<v Speaker 1>We attained it in 2012,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three years ahead of the most optimistic</v>

131
00:07:45.021 --> 00:07:45.854
<v Speaker 1>projections.</v>

132
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:48.350
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so people are being lifted out of</v>

133
00:07:48.351 --> 00:07:52.700
<v Speaker 1>poverty at a rate that has never been</v>
<v Speaker 1>seen in the history of the world hooked</v>

134
00:07:52.701 --> 00:07:56.840
<v Speaker 1>to the power grids provided with cell</v>
<v Speaker 1>phones provided with free,</v>

135
00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:01.370
<v Speaker 1>with access to fresh water provided with</v>
<v Speaker 1>access to medications that decrease</v>

136
00:08:01.371 --> 00:08:04.490
<v Speaker 1>child mortality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you look at the statistics,</v>

137
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:07.910
<v Speaker 1>there are so many things getting better</v>
<v Speaker 1>so fast you cannot even believe it.</v>

138
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.090
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here's that's a consequences as far</v>

139
00:08:11.091 --> 00:08:14.090
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as the data indicate of the</v>

140
00:08:14.091 --> 00:08:17.930
<v Speaker 1>operation of the free market system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which does produce inequality.</v>

141
00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:20.750
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as far as I can tell,</v>

142
00:08:20.751 --> 00:08:25.751
<v Speaker 1>the only system that has ever produced</v>
<v Speaker 1>wealth and as law or has every system</v>

143
00:08:26.451 --> 00:08:30.710
<v Speaker 1>produces inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the only system we know of that</v>

144
00:08:30.711 --> 00:08:34.610
<v Speaker 1>produces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>produces wealth and inequality is the</v>

145
00:08:34.611 --> 00:08:38.210
<v Speaker 1>free market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's a question for everyone left</v>

146
00:08:38.211 --> 00:08:38.750
<v Speaker 1>and right.</v>

147
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:42.290
<v Speaker 1>How many units of inequality will you</v>
<v Speaker 1>tolerate to produce one unit of wealth?</v>

148
00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:47.570
<v Speaker 1>And if the answer is zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you've gone too far.</v>

149
00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.110
<v Speaker 1>You're outside the appropriate political</v>
<v Speaker 1>debate.</v>

150
00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:55.620
<v Speaker 1>That's the wrong answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you try to impose all there will</v>

151
00:08:55.621 --> 00:09:00.621
<v Speaker 1>be as mayhem because the price we pay</v>
<v Speaker 1>for wealth is inequality.</v>

152
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:06.600
<v Speaker 1>Now that doesn't mean that you can let</v>
<v Speaker 1>inequality run to its ultimate extreme</v>

153
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.340
<v Speaker 1>because then you run into the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>

154
00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.950
<v Speaker 1>which is the monopoly problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've all played monopoly.</v>

155
00:09:10.951 --> 00:09:13.590
<v Speaker 1>I presume what happens in every monopoly</v>
<v Speaker 1>game,</v>

156
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.270
<v Speaker 1>if you lay it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's stacks out at zero,</v>

157
00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:21.750
<v Speaker 1>zero except one person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now if you play it 50 times,</v>

158
00:09:21.751 --> 00:09:25.050
<v Speaker 1>you'll find that it's hardly ever the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same person because it's basically a</v>

159
00:09:25.051 --> 00:09:27.540
<v Speaker 1>game of chance and there's a fair bit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>chance,</v>

160
00:09:27.541 --> 00:09:29.520
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>operating in the distribution of money</v>

161
00:09:29.521 --> 00:09:30.150
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>

162
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.310
<v Speaker 1>It's not all chance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a fair bit of chance.</v>

163
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.180
<v Speaker 1>But the logical conclusion to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy that can play itself out</v>

164
00:09:36.181 --> 00:09:39.420
<v Speaker 1>totally is that one person has</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything and everyone else has</v>

165
00:09:39.421 --> 00:09:42.660
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously that's not a useful outcome.</v>

166
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.380
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

167
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.570
<v Speaker 1>the way there are ways that we fix that</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our society,</v>

168
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.070
<v Speaker 1>we have progressive tax policies and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can argue about their utility,</v>

169
00:09:53.071 --> 00:09:57.060
<v Speaker 1>but that's one way of rectifying it</v>
<v Speaker 1>potentially.</v>

170
00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Another way of rectifying is that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have one game right?</v>

171
00:10:01.171 --> 00:10:03.330
<v Speaker 1>In a pluralistic society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have many,</v>

172
00:10:03.331 --> 00:10:06.750
<v Speaker 1>many games that people can play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you can't be a successful</v>

173
00:10:06.751 --> 00:10:08.820
<v Speaker 1>lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then maybe you could be a successful</v>

174
00:10:08.821 --> 00:10:10.380
<v Speaker 1>plumber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you can't be a successful</v>

175
00:10:10.381 --> 00:10:12.450
<v Speaker 1>plumber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you can run this small restaurant</v>

176
00:10:12.451 --> 00:10:14.430
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a diversity of games.</v>

177
00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:18.060
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a good way of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of allowing,</v>

178
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.640
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of increasing the robustness of the</v>

179
00:10:20.641 --> 00:10:24.070
<v Speaker 1>system so that you don't get hierarchies</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are so steep that they collapse in</v>

180
00:10:24.071 --> 00:10:24.480
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

181
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.450
<v Speaker 1>in an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an,</v>

182
00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:26.640
<v Speaker 1>in upon themselves.</v>

183
00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:30.120
<v Speaker 1>And so those are sophisticated</v>
<v Speaker 1>approaches and perhaps your other</v>

184
00:10:30.121 --> 00:10:32.280
<v Speaker 1>approach is to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's an intractable problem.</v>

185
00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:35.160
<v Speaker 1>It says in the New Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the things you'd swear would</v>

186
00:10:35.161 --> 00:10:37.860
<v Speaker 1>be edited out because it's such a harsh</v>
<v Speaker 1>statement.</v>

187
00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:41.190
<v Speaker 1>The poor will be with us always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

188
00:10:41.191 --> 00:10:44.010
<v Speaker 1>what's that in reference to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also in reference to the Matthew</v>

189
00:10:44.011 --> 00:10:46.380
<v Speaker 1>principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is another new testament statement</v>

190
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:51.500
<v Speaker 1>and happens to be an economic axiom to</v>
<v Speaker 1>those who have everything more will be</v>

191
00:10:51.631 --> 00:10:54.990
<v Speaker 1>given from those who have nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything will be taken.</v>

192
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:59.190
<v Speaker 1>That's the structure of the world and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't lay it at the feet of the</v>

193
00:10:59.191 --> 00:11:02.070
<v Speaker 1>West.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the structure of the world now.</v>

194
00:11:02.071 --> 00:11:05.370
<v Speaker 1>That means we have to contend with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not an easy thing to contend</v>

195
00:11:05.371 --> 00:11:07.020
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason that we have a</v>

196
00:11:07.021 --> 00:11:11.430
<v Speaker 1>continual political dialogue and that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to have a continual political</v>

197
00:11:11.431 --> 00:11:14.370
<v Speaker 1>dialogue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to make sure that our hierarchies</v>

198
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:18.810
<v Speaker 1>exist and remain intact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't become so steep and corrupt</v>

199
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:22.140
<v Speaker 1>that they destroy themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you need a left and a right for</v>

200
00:11:22.141 --> 00:11:24.080
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if and,</v>

201
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:28.350
<v Speaker 1>but that means the left half has to</v>
<v Speaker 1>admit that hierarchies are not only</v>

202
00:11:28.351 --> 00:11:32.460
<v Speaker 1>necessary but valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the right has to admit that despite</v>

203
00:11:32.461 --> 00:11:35.790
<v Speaker 1>their necessity in value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tend to stack people up at the</v>

204
00:11:35.791 --> 00:11:37.890
<v Speaker 1>bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that actually constitutes a</v>

205
00:11:37.891 --> 00:11:38.850
<v Speaker 1>continual problem.</v>
