1
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:07.340
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.701
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3
00:00:07.701 --> 00:00:10.970
<v Speaker 1>so about two months ago made these videos.</v>

4
00:00:10.971 --> 00:00:11.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.990
<v Speaker 1>I did it because I was trying to articulate my concerns.</v>

6
00:00:14.991 --> 00:00:15.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

7
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.621
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8
00:00:15.621 --> 00:00:18.830
<v Speaker 1>sometimes when you're having a debate or discussion with someone that you love</v>

9
00:00:18.831 --> 00:00:21.980
<v Speaker 1>and you're having a little argument about something like who's gonna do the</v>

10
00:00:21.981 --> 00:00:23.300
<v Speaker 1>dishes or something like that.</v>

11
00:00:23.301 --> 00:00:23.690
<v Speaker 1>Her,</v>

12
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.480
<v Speaker 1>especially if you haven't been getting along very well with that person,</v>

13
00:00:26.481 --> 00:00:30.440
<v Speaker 1>you know how the discussion starts with something specific and then you start</v>

14
00:00:30.441 --> 00:00:34.220
<v Speaker 1>trading all the things that it might be about until you're arguing about,</v>

15
00:00:34.221 --> 00:00:34.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:34.551 --> 00:00:37.370
<v Speaker 1>the way that you behaved on your third date,</v>

17
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.671
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

18
00:00:37.671 --> 00:00:38.510
<v Speaker 1>10 years ago.</v>

19
00:00:38.511 --> 00:00:43.511
<v Speaker 1>And the whole underlying unresolved chaos of your relationship emerges through</v>

20
00:00:43.761 --> 00:00:46.520
<v Speaker 1>the little portal that was defined by the argument,</v>

21
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:46.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:47.091
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

23
00:00:47.091 --> 00:00:48.200
<v Speaker 1>that's what this is about.</v>

24
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:49.251
<v Speaker 1>And when you talk,</v>

25
00:00:49.251 --> 00:00:50.270
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean you're right.</v>

26
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.320
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean you're correct,</v>

27
00:00:51.321 --> 00:00:51.500
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

28
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.350
<v Speaker 1>It means you're trying to articulate and formulate your thoughts like the bone</v>

29
00:00:54.351 --> 00:00:55.220
<v Speaker 1>headed more on net.</v>

30
00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:56.030
<v Speaker 1>You are,</v>

31
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.420
<v Speaker 1>and you're going to stumble around idiotically because what the hell do you</v>

32
00:00:59.421 --> 00:00:59.690
<v Speaker 1>know?</v>

33
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.840
<v Speaker 1>You're full of biases and you're ignorant and he can't speak very well and</v>

34
00:01:02.841 --> 00:01:06.500
<v Speaker 1>you're over emotional and you know you've got just problems that you can hardly</v>

35
00:01:06.501 --> 00:01:10.220
<v Speaker 1>even imagine that are interfering with your ability to state something clear.</v>

36
00:01:10.221 --> 00:01:14.060
<v Speaker 1>And so what you do is you do your best to say what you mean and then you listen</v>

37
00:01:14.061 --> 00:01:16.670
<v Speaker 1>to other people tell you why you're a blithering idiot.</v>

38
00:01:16.671 --> 00:01:20.210
<v Speaker 1>And hopefully you can correct yourself to some degree as a consequence of</v>

39
00:01:20.211 --> 00:01:20.871
<v Speaker 1>listening to them.</v>

40
00:01:20.871 --> 00:01:23.030
<v Speaker 1>And you see that's what free speech is about.</v>

41
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.140
<v Speaker 1>It isn't just that people can organize themselves and their societies by</v>

42
00:01:27.141 --> 00:01:29.420
<v Speaker 1>thinking you can't do that because there's only one of you.</v>

43
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.720
<v Speaker 1>What do you have to do is you have to articulate your thoughts in a public forum</v>

44
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.200
<v Speaker 1>so that other people can attack you and hopefully in a corrective manner.</v>

45
00:01:36.201 --> 00:01:37.250
<v Speaker 1>And then you want to,</v>

46
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

47
00:01:37.821 --> 00:01:39.140
<v Speaker 1>step back a little bit and think,</v>

48
00:01:39.141 --> 00:01:39.471
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

49
00:01:39.471 --> 00:01:39.681
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

50
00:01:39.681 --> 00:01:39.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

51
00:01:39.981 --> 00:01:42.500
<v Speaker 1>I was a little arrogant there and I was a little over emotional there and I</v>

52
00:01:42.501 --> 00:01:43.640
<v Speaker 1>didn't get that quite right.</v>

53
00:01:43.641 --> 00:01:46.370
<v Speaker 1>And maybe I'm outright biased on that front.</v>

54
00:01:46.371 --> 00:01:47.050
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>

55
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.570
<v Speaker 1>you want to correct what you say because then you correct how you are and then</v>

56
00:01:50.571 --> 00:01:53.710
<v Speaker 1>you correct how you act in life and then you correct your society.</v>

57
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.140
<v Speaker 1>And to the degree that we limit free freedom of expression,</v>

58
00:01:57.141 --> 00:01:58.400
<v Speaker 1>we put all of that at risk.</v>

59
00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.280
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly why I don't believe that freedom of speech is just another</v>

60
00:02:01.281 --> 00:02:01.641
<v Speaker 1>value.</v>

61
00:02:01.641 --> 00:02:02.960
<v Speaker 1>I think that's preposterous.</v>

62
00:02:02.961 --> 00:02:04.250
<v Speaker 1>I think that if you claim that,</v>

63
00:02:04.251 --> 00:02:08.150
<v Speaker 1>then you know nothing about Western civilization and history is freedom of</v>

64
00:02:08.151 --> 00:02:09.980
<v Speaker 1>speech is not just another principle.</v>

65
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.270
<v Speaker 1>It's the mechanism by which we keep our psyches and our society's organized and</v>

66
00:02:14.271 --> 00:02:19.250
<v Speaker 1>we have to be unbelievably careful about in infringing upon that because we're</v>

67
00:02:19.251 --> 00:02:23.870
<v Speaker 1>infringing upon the process by which we keep chaos and order balanced.</v>

68
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.200
<v Speaker 1>The proper citizen is the person who embodies truth in speech and attempts to</v>

69
00:02:30.921 --> 00:02:31.551
<v Speaker 1>act it out.</v>

70
00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:35.000
<v Speaker 1>And that also includes listening because listening is part of communicative</v>

71
00:02:35.001 --> 00:02:35.834
<v Speaker 1>intent.</v>

72
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.030
<v Speaker 1>And I think at the moment that we're in,</v>

73
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.870
<v Speaker 1>we're embroiled in a war on every single one of those dimensions and several</v>

74
00:02:41.871 --> 00:02:44.150
<v Speaker 1>others that I haven't had time to list.</v>

75
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.740
<v Speaker 1>And the evidence that we're in that sort of war is precisely the fact that this</v>

76
00:02:48.741 --> 00:02:50.300
<v Speaker 1>has attracted so much attention.</v>

77
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.511
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

78
00:02:50.511 --> 00:02:54.920
<v Speaker 1>I just sat my bloody office at home and threw up a couple of amateurish videos,</v>

79
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:55.581
<v Speaker 1>more or less,</v>

80
00:02:55.581 --> 00:02:59.320
<v Speaker 1>attempting to articulate my feelings about a couple of policies and it's all</v>

81
00:02:59.321 --> 00:03:01.060
<v Speaker 1>hell broke loose and why?</v>

82
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.661
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

83
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:04.960
<v Speaker 1>because that hell is right underneath the surface.</v>

84
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.770
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to read you something that a graduate students sent me from the</v>

85
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:11.381
<v Speaker 1>University of Toronto the other day.</v>

86
00:03:11.381 --> 00:03:16.381
<v Speaker 1>And I can also tell you that I've received hundreds of letters like this today.</v>

87
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.040
<v Speaker 1>I had a tutorial at the University of Toronto where I talked about Jordan</v>

88
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.290
<v Speaker 1>Peterson and issues of personal identity,</v>

89
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.600
<v Speaker 1>legally sanctioned identity categories,</v>

90
00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:26.410
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

91
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.390
<v Speaker 1>I brought up a video of a tall white man in his thirties who asked students out</v>

92
00:03:31.391 --> 00:03:33.490
<v Speaker 1>of university how they'd react if he told them.</v>

93
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.260
<v Speaker 1>He identified as a woman,</v>

94
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.423
<v Speaker 1>as black,</v>

95
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.580
<v Speaker 1>as short and is five years old.</v>

96
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:41.440
<v Speaker 1>Spoiler alert.</v>

97
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.400
<v Speaker 1>Students in the video resists some of the later categories a bit better,</v>

98
00:03:45.401 --> 00:03:46.450
<v Speaker 1>mostly accepting.</v>

99
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.920
<v Speaker 1>Still students were not engaging in discussion.</v>

100
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.520
<v Speaker 1>I asked them why one said it was because she was worried to share her opinion</v>

101
00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.460
<v Speaker 1>for fear of being singled out or saying something offensive.</v>

102
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.970
<v Speaker 1>I asked who else was not speaking for that reason?</v>

103
00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.090
<v Speaker 1>The whole class put their hands up.</v>

104
00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:10.820
<v Speaker 1>No participation.</v>

105
00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:12.703
<v Speaker 1>Why</v>

106
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.020
<v Speaker 1>they weren't uninterested.</v>

107
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.170
<v Speaker 1>They were afraid to speak their minds.</v>

108
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.680
<v Speaker 1>The PC police are in your heads.</v>

109
00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.470
<v Speaker 1>I'll start with lawyer one who was the counsel to several prime ministers.</v>

110
00:04:27.471 --> 00:04:30.320
<v Speaker 1>He talked to me about the human rights tribunals cause I went and saw him two</v>

111
00:04:30.321 --> 00:04:31.700
<v Speaker 1>weeks after this all started.</v>

112
00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.990
<v Speaker 1>Human rights tribunals is a kangaroo court in my opinion,</v>

113
00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.210
<v Speaker 1>and it should be abolished as fast as possible.</v>

114
00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.720
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the many institutions in Canada that pose a threat to your,</v>

115
00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.440
<v Speaker 1>to your freedom that is almost unimaginable proportions.</v>

116
00:04:45.441 --> 00:04:48.200
<v Speaker 1>Here's what this top lawyer told me.</v>

117
00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.230
<v Speaker 1>If I'm taking it in front of the human rights tribunal and will cost me $250,000</v>

118
00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.800
<v Speaker 1>I will pay the legal costs for my opponents and I will lose.</v>

119
00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.571
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

120
00:04:59.571 --> 00:05:02.870
<v Speaker 1>go back to your safe little life and shut your mouth.</v>

121
00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.920
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

122
00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.300
<v Speaker 1>Second lawyer told me my critique of the Ontario Human Rights Commission is spot</v>

123
00:05:09.301 --> 00:05:12.780
<v Speaker 1>on and absent the charter of rights and freedoms,</v>

124
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.170
<v Speaker 1>which has these contradictions built into it that you just heard described.</v>

125
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.500
<v Speaker 1>Much of what I was saying was illegal and has been illegal since 2012 lawyer</v>

126
00:05:22.321 --> 00:05:25.470
<v Speaker 1>three told me that if I breached a tribunal order,</v>

127
00:05:25.471 --> 00:05:28.740
<v Speaker 1>so imagine I was taken in front of the human rights tribunal and I was fine and</v>

128
00:05:28.741 --> 00:05:30.600
<v Speaker 1>then I refused to pay the fine,</v>

129
00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.220
<v Speaker 1>which I've stated that I would do.</v>

130
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.830
<v Speaker 1>That equals contempt of court,</v>

131
00:05:34.831 --> 00:05:37.800
<v Speaker 1>which inevitably means jail until the contempt is purged.</v>

132
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.420
<v Speaker 1>The social justice tribunals and the SJWs social justice warriors who staff them</v>

133
00:05:42.421 --> 00:05:43.590
<v Speaker 1>have a robe nature.</v>

134
00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.750
<v Speaker 1>They can search your house without a warrant.</v>

135
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:47.730
<v Speaker 1>They can use secret hearings.</v>

136
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.820
<v Speaker 1>There are no rules of evidence and the judges are unaccountable,</v>

137
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:52.650
<v Speaker 1>but those are legal opinions.</v>

138
00:05:52.651 --> 00:05:52.891
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>

139
00:05:52.891 --> 00:05:54.210
<v Speaker 1>let's look at a real world case.</v>

140
00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.190
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at what happened when I made my videos.</v>

141
00:05:56.191 --> 00:06:00.110
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at how the responded because I can tell you in the video,</v>

142
00:06:00.111 --> 00:06:00.590
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

143
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.861
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

144
00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:02.960
<v Speaker 1>what I'm doing is probably illegal and worse.</v>

145
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:06.050
<v Speaker 1>My employer is legally responsible for it because that's built in,</v>

146
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.490
<v Speaker 1>that's built into the codes as well.</v>

147
00:06:07.491 --> 00:06:08.061
<v Speaker 1>So by the way,</v>

148
00:06:08.061 --> 00:06:08.781
<v Speaker 1>if you're an employer,</v>

149
00:06:08.781 --> 00:06:13.420
<v Speaker 1>you're responsible for everything that your employees say and everything that in</v>

150
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.280
<v Speaker 1>anybody interprets what they said as being,</v>

151
00:06:16.281 --> 00:06:18.740
<v Speaker 1>whether it's unintentional or intentional,</v>

152
00:06:18.741 --> 00:06:20.690
<v Speaker 1>whether or not a complaint has been made.</v>

153
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:22.370
<v Speaker 1>So just think about that.</v>

154
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:23.181
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

155
00:06:23.181 --> 00:06:26.570
<v Speaker 1>October 3rd the university said like all members of the university community,</v>

156
00:06:26.571 --> 00:06:31.190
<v Speaker 1>I have an obligation to comply with the law including the provisions of the</v>

157
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:31.760
<v Speaker 1>Ontario Human Rights Code,</v>

158
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.040
<v Speaker 1>their policy with regards to workplace harassment,</v>

159
00:06:34.041 --> 00:06:37.490
<v Speaker 1>which the university implied that I was engaging in engaging in a course of</v>

160
00:06:37.491 --> 00:06:42.020
<v Speaker 1>vexatious comment or conduct where the course of comment or conduct is known or</v>

161
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.510
<v Speaker 1>reasonably be known to be unwelcome.</v>

162
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.170
<v Speaker 1>The university reviewed my videos and they decided that what I said was true.</v>

163
00:06:48.171 --> 00:06:51.320
<v Speaker 1>They decided that the video I made was probably illegal and that they were</v>

164
00:06:51.321 --> 00:06:52.250
<v Speaker 1>responsible for it.</v>

165
00:06:52.251 --> 00:06:56.420
<v Speaker 1>And so in an attempt to distance themselves from me under counsel from their</v>

166
00:06:56.421 --> 00:06:57.350
<v Speaker 1>legal people,</v>

167
00:06:57.351 --> 00:06:58.011
<v Speaker 1>and believe me,</v>

168
00:06:58.011 --> 00:06:59.840
<v Speaker 1>the university has good legal people.</v>

169
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:01.250
<v Speaker 1>They sent me a warning,</v>

170
00:07:01.251 --> 00:07:04.880
<v Speaker 1>and this is what happens if you want to discipline a recalcitrant employee.</v>

171
00:07:04.881 --> 00:07:05.571
<v Speaker 1>Essentially what?</v>

172
00:07:05.571 --> 00:07:08.540
<v Speaker 1>So that you don't have to bear legal responsibility for their acts.</v>

173
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:13.600
<v Speaker 1>So on October 18th the university mentioned to me in another warning letter that</v>

174
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.550
<v Speaker 1>if personal pronouns are being used,</v>

175
00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.950
<v Speaker 1>the refusal to use the personal pronoun,</v>

176
00:07:18.951 --> 00:07:22.010
<v Speaker 1>that is an expression of the person's gender identity can constitute</v>

177
00:07:22.011 --> 00:07:22.880
<v Speaker 1>discrimination.</v>

178
00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:27.330
<v Speaker 1>So now you see what's happened is that I haven't refused to use someone's</v>

179
00:07:27.331 --> 00:07:28.070
<v Speaker 1>gender,</v>

180
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:31.370
<v Speaker 1>a gender neutral pronouns I said that I would refuse.</v>

181
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.910
<v Speaker 1>So it's not even the refusal itself that's producing the letters.</v>

182
00:07:34.911 --> 00:07:38.360
<v Speaker 1>It's my declared intent to engage in the refusal.</v>

183
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:39.740
<v Speaker 1>And as far as I was concerned,</v>

184
00:07:39.741 --> 00:07:43.010
<v Speaker 1>what I was essentially doing was criticizing a piece of legislation that had not</v>

185
00:07:43.011 --> 00:07:43.910
<v Speaker 1>yet been passed,</v>

186
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:48.260
<v Speaker 1>but the university's legal department decided that all that was sufficient for</v>

187
00:07:48.261 --> 00:07:52.700
<v Speaker 1>them to distance themselves from me and to engage in disciplinary activity.</v>

188
00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:57.440
<v Speaker 1>I would say a a legal doctrine is something like a virus and it has a life if</v>

189
00:07:57.441 --> 00:07:58.480
<v Speaker 1>you output,</v>

190
00:07:58.490 --> 00:07:59.870
<v Speaker 1>we think if you,</v>

191
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:04.430
<v Speaker 1>if you let it go into a living system that it propagates and it has effects and</v>

192
00:08:04.431 --> 00:08:07.760
<v Speaker 1>the effects are a consequence of the philosophy that's embedded inside the law.</v>

193
00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:09.530
<v Speaker 1>And if you really want to know about this,</v>

194
00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:12.680
<v Speaker 1>you should read Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn school leg archipelago because what he</v>

195
00:08:12.681 --> 00:08:16.730
<v Speaker 1>does in that book is tell you how the hypothetically humane doctrines that were</v>

196
00:08:16.731 --> 00:08:20.810
<v Speaker 1>embedded in radical Marxism at the end of the 18 hundreds unfolded into Soviet</v>

197
00:08:20.811 --> 00:08:22.040
<v Speaker 1>society and demolished it.</v>

198
00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:24.740
<v Speaker 1>But I want to tell you a little bit about what the law does.</v>

199
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:28.490
<v Speaker 1>And this is with regards to its interpretation from the policy guidelines.</v>

200
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:32.690
<v Speaker 1>It instantiates social constructionism into our legal system.</v>

201
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:35.180
<v Speaker 1>You have to understand what that means.</v>

202
00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:38.360
<v Speaker 1>There's a huge debate about how human identity is,</v>

203
00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:39.140
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

204
00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:39.471
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

205
00:08:39.471 --> 00:08:40.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

206
00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:40.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

207
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:42.800
<v Speaker 1>upon what grounds human identity is predicated.</v>

208
00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:47.210
<v Speaker 1>Now the radical social constructionists basically say that identity is nothing</v>

209
00:08:47.211 --> 00:08:50.600
<v Speaker 1>but a social construction and not that's in keeping with their philosophical</v>

210
00:08:50.601 --> 00:08:51.111
<v Speaker 1>doctrines,</v>

211
00:08:51.111 --> 00:08:52.490
<v Speaker 1>partly Marxist and Parsley,</v>

212
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:53.600
<v Speaker 1>partly postmodern.</v>

213
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:54.823
<v Speaker 1>But that isn't,</v>

214
00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:58.440
<v Speaker 1>and that was what I was objecting to with regards to bill [inaudible] because it</v>

215
00:08:58.441 --> 00:08:59.310
<v Speaker 1>insists,</v>

216
00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:00.480
<v Speaker 1>do you understand this?</v>

217
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:04.920
<v Speaker 1>It makes this legal doctrine that biological sex,</v>

218
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.480
<v Speaker 1>gender identity,</v>

219
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:11.690
<v Speaker 1>gender expression and sexual orientation very independently and they don't.</v>

220
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:18.570
<v Speaker 1>Now the reason they don't is because 98% of people,</v>

221
00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:20.640
<v Speaker 1>it's 99.7% of people,</v>

222
00:09:20.641 --> 00:09:21.031
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

223
00:09:21.031 --> 00:09:24.600
<v Speaker 1>at least with regards to the most credible statistics have a gender identity.</v>

224
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:29.250
<v Speaker 1>This essentially identical with their biological sex and almost everybody who is</v>

225
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:33.750
<v Speaker 1>male and female by biological sex and gender identity dresses that way.</v>

226
00:09:33.751 --> 00:09:36.120
<v Speaker 1>And that's what it gender expression essentially is.</v>

227
00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:39.480
<v Speaker 1>And then if you stack those three things on top of each other,</v>

228
00:09:39.481 --> 00:09:40.590
<v Speaker 1>they're basically isomorphic.</v>

229
00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:45.360
<v Speaker 1>You can add sexual orientation to that and 98% of people are heterosexual.</v>

230
00:09:45.361 --> 00:09:50.361
<v Speaker 1>So the idea that those things very independently is absolutely preposterous,</v>

231
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:55.470
<v Speaker 1>but it's written into the law and that has terrible consequences.</v>

232
00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:56.430
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>

233
00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:57.241
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

234
00:09:57.241 --> 00:09:57.961
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

235
00:09:57.961 --> 00:09:59.580
<v Speaker 1>now to what degree,</v>

236
00:09:59.581 --> 00:10:03.030
<v Speaker 1>any discussion in universities of the biological differences between men and</v>

237
00:10:03.031 --> 00:10:04.830
<v Speaker 1>women are legal and you think,</v>

238
00:10:04.831 --> 00:10:04.951
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

239
00:10:04.951 --> 00:10:06.300
<v Speaker 1>well that's an exaggeration.</v>

240
00:10:06.301 --> 00:10:06.780
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

241
00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:07.320
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

242
00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:07.830
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

243
00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:09.690
<v Speaker 1>I debated Nicholas Matte,</v>

244
00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.070
<v Speaker 1>I believe that was his name of professor at the University of Toronto on TV owes</v>

245
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:13.913
<v Speaker 1>the agenda.</v>

246
00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:15.420
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

247
00:10:15.421 --> 00:10:19.800
<v Speaker 1>write out for everyone to hear that the scientific consensus is that there's no</v>

248
00:10:19.801 --> 00:10:21.900
<v Speaker 1>biological differences between men and women.</v>

249
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:26.520
<v Speaker 1>And I've received letters from people who've told me that now the social justice</v>

250
00:10:26.521 --> 00:10:29.850
<v Speaker 1>activist types are complaining about the fact that the biologists assign</v>

251
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:34.050
<v Speaker 1>biological sex to animals because it's only a social construct that we're</v>

252
00:10:34.051 --> 00:10:35.610
<v Speaker 1>projecting onto their being.</v>

253
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:36.900
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

254
00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:37.171
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

255
00:10:37.171 --> 00:10:38.700
<v Speaker 1>we just heard that the co,</v>

256
00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:41.670
<v Speaker 1>the chromosomal level of analysis is complex.</v>

257
00:10:41.671 --> 00:10:42.840
<v Speaker 1>It's not that complex.</v>

258
00:10:42.841 --> 00:10:47.841
<v Speaker 1>What we have is a bi modal distribution with a tiny number of exceptions in that</v>

259
00:10:47.851 --> 00:10:48.301
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

260
00:10:48.301 --> 00:10:49.560
<v Speaker 1>is not a spectrum.</v>

261
00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:53.040
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that builds in for example is the claim that identity is</v>

262
00:10:53.041 --> 00:10:54.780
<v Speaker 1>only subjectively defined.</v>

263
00:10:54.781 --> 00:10:55.830
<v Speaker 1>And that's built right in.</v>

264
00:10:55.831 --> 00:10:58.800
<v Speaker 1>It says that your identity is whatever you think it is.</v>

265
00:10:58.920 --> 00:10:59.071
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

266
00:10:59.071 --> 00:10:59.910
<v Speaker 1>let me tell you,</v>

267
00:10:59.911 --> 00:11:01.440
<v Speaker 1>as a practicing psychologist,</v>

268
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:03.420
<v Speaker 1>that's absolute rubbish.</v>

269
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:07.120
<v Speaker 1>Your identity to look when,</v>

270
00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:08.700
<v Speaker 1>when children are two years old,</v>

271
00:11:08.701 --> 00:11:09.870
<v Speaker 1>that's what they think.</v>

272
00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:13.560
<v Speaker 1>They think that their subjective reality is everything and what you do is you</v>

273
00:11:13.561 --> 00:11:18.561
<v Speaker 1>socialize them between the ages of two and four to adopt an identity that's part</v>

274
00:11:18.781 --> 00:11:20.310
<v Speaker 1>of a cultural negotiation.</v>

275
00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:22.860
<v Speaker 1>It's like your identity as part of a cultural negotiation.</v>

276
00:11:22.861 --> 00:11:24.300
<v Speaker 1>It's partly the game you play in.</v>

277
00:11:24.301 --> 00:11:28.560
<v Speaker 1>Partly the game that I play with you and I have to be a voluntary participant in</v>

278
00:11:28.561 --> 00:11:29.880
<v Speaker 1>that and not only,</v>

279
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:32.400
<v Speaker 1>not only is it not subjectively defined,</v>

280
00:11:32.401 --> 00:11:33.840
<v Speaker 1>which detaches it entirely,</v>

281
00:11:33.841 --> 00:11:34.291
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

282
00:11:34.291 --> 00:11:37.710
<v Speaker 1>from the underlying biological and the underlying objective reality,</v>

283
00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:41.820
<v Speaker 1>making any claim you want for your subjective identity valid.</v>

284
00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:43.440
<v Speaker 1>The other thing it does,</v>

285
00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:45.810
<v Speaker 1>it completely oblivious.</v>

286
00:11:45.811 --> 00:11:50.760
<v Speaker 1>Hates the idea that identity is actually a Prac pragmatic entity for God's sake.</v>

287
00:11:50.761 --> 00:11:52.950
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you're a lawyer or a father or mother,</v>

288
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.570
<v Speaker 1>like an identity that has some solidity to it,</v>

289
00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:00.040
<v Speaker 1>your identity is also a vehicle within which you traveled through life,</v>

290
00:12:00.041 --> 00:12:00.221
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

291
00:12:00.221 --> 00:12:01.240
<v Speaker 1>It's a set of tools,</v>

292
00:12:01.241 --> 00:12:04.750
<v Speaker 1>a set of pragmatic tools that you use to interact with the social and the</v>

293
00:12:04.751 --> 00:12:05.620
<v Speaker 1>natural world.</v>

294
00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:07.930
<v Speaker 1>It's not only your subjective whim.</v>

295
00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:10.360
<v Speaker 1>The idea of gender identity,</v>

296
00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:12.400
<v Speaker 1>which is only defined subjectively in,</v>

297
00:12:12.401 --> 00:12:12.671
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

298
00:12:12.671 --> 00:12:16.150
<v Speaker 1>in the relevant law has been studied intensively by personality psychologist</v>

299
00:12:16.151 --> 00:12:16.901
<v Speaker 1>such as myself.</v>

300
00:12:16.901 --> 00:12:17.261
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

301
00:12:17.261 --> 00:12:18.370
<v Speaker 1>my lab has done some of the,</v>

302
00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.740
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say the most fundamental research on it,</v>

303
00:12:20.741 --> 00:12:21.221
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

304
00:12:21.221 --> 00:12:22.750
<v Speaker 1>we're in the boat and we're in the ballpark.</v>

305
00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.130
<v Speaker 1>Here's a little story.</v>

306
00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:24.701
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

307
00:12:24.701 --> 00:12:25.870
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

308
00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:29.200
<v Speaker 1>the differences between personality between men and women are basically what</v>

309
00:12:29.201 --> 00:12:30.700
<v Speaker 1>constitutes gender identity.</v>

310
00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:32.680
<v Speaker 1>And in so far as it's not merely subjective.</v>

311
00:12:32.681 --> 00:12:36.190
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that's happened is that as the Scandinavian countries have</v>

312
00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:39.610
<v Speaker 1>equalize their political and sociological landscape,</v>

313
00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:44.080
<v Speaker 1>the differences in identity between men and women have got larger,</v>

314
00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:45.100
<v Speaker 1>not smaller.</v>

315
00:12:45.101 --> 00:12:46.150
<v Speaker 1>Do you understand that?</v>

316
00:12:46.151 --> 00:12:50.050
<v Speaker 1>That's a refutation of the social constructionist claim.</v>

317
00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:51.420
<v Speaker 1>So what happens is,</v>

318
00:12:51.421 --> 00:12:54.370
<v Speaker 1>is that if you flatten out the landscape so that there are very few</v>

319
00:12:54.371 --> 00:12:56.590
<v Speaker 1>socioeconomic differences say,</v>

320
00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:59.440
<v Speaker 1>or sociological differences in the treatment between men and women,</v>

321
00:12:59.441 --> 00:13:02.980
<v Speaker 1>what happens is the biological difference maximizes,</v>

322
00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:07.330
<v Speaker 1>it maximizes you understand that means men and women get more different,</v>

323
00:13:07.331 --> 00:13:08.200
<v Speaker 1>not more the same.</v>

324
00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:10.240
<v Speaker 1>And the thing about women in the audience,</v>

325
00:13:10.241 --> 00:13:10.961
<v Speaker 1>bloody hell,</v>

326
00:13:10.961 --> 00:13:14.200
<v Speaker 1>you should think about this because don't you want to pursue the things that</v>

327
00:13:14.201 --> 00:13:15.130
<v Speaker 1>you're interested in?</v>

328
00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:18.250
<v Speaker 1>And if you pursue the things that you're interested in because you're interested</v>

329
00:13:18.251 --> 00:13:19.480
<v Speaker 1>in different things than men,</v>

330
00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:20.161
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you.</v>

331
00:13:20.161 --> 00:13:21.760
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at the interest,</v>

332
00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:24.010
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the interest variation,</v>

333
00:13:24.011 --> 00:13:25.660
<v Speaker 1>this has been established technically.</v>

334
00:13:25.661 --> 00:13:27.220
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the interest variation,</v>

335
00:13:27.221 --> 00:13:29.350
<v Speaker 1>there's almost no overlap between men and women.</v>

336
00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:31.360
<v Speaker 1>If you sum up the differences in interest,</v>

337
00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:32.440
<v Speaker 1>interest in temperament.</v>

338
00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:34.773
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

339
00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:39.903
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

340
00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:40.980
<v Speaker 3>Professor Peterson.</v>

341
00:13:40.981 --> 00:13:41.910
<v Speaker 3>Let's start with you.</v>

342
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:42.151
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

343
00:13:42.151 --> 00:13:43.470
<v Speaker 3>so this question says,</v>

344
00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.750
<v Speaker 3>you present your issue with bill.</v>

345
00:13:45.751 --> 00:13:50.610
<v Speaker 3>See 16 to be that the infringement of freedom of expression regarding gender</v>

346
00:13:50.611 --> 00:13:51.960
<v Speaker 3>pronouns is the problem.</v>

347
00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:56.400
<v Speaker 3>Do you hold the same stance with other discriminatory language and the human</v>

348
00:13:56.401 --> 00:14:00.980
<v Speaker 3>rights code such as being able to use racist terms,</v>

349
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:01.230
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

350
00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:02.760
<v Speaker 3>with regard to students?</v>

351
00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:07.470
<v Speaker 3>And if you believe that one of these things is a violation but not the other</v>

352
00:14:07.471 --> 00:14:07.830
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>

353
00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:08.490
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

354
00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:10.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure I read that at all that well,</v>

355
00:14:10.201 --> 00:14:11.250
<v Speaker 3>but you get the idea.</v>

356
00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:11.881
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

357
00:14:11.881 --> 00:14:12.714
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

358
00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that these issues are the same.</v>

359
00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they're the same at all.</v>

360
00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:19.953
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

361
00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:22.180
<v Speaker 1>I think being thinking about the pronoun thing,</v>

362
00:14:22.181 --> 00:14:22.451
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

363
00:14:22.451 --> 00:14:26.140
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things that people put me back on my heels for a while</v>

364
00:14:26.141 --> 00:14:27.790
<v Speaker 1>because the claim was basically,</v>

365
00:14:27.791 --> 00:14:30.680
<v Speaker 1>well it's something like why doesn't the mean professor just play nice and,</v>

366
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:33.040
<v Speaker 1>and respect people by using their pronouns?</v>

367
00:14:33.041 --> 00:14:36.790
<v Speaker 1>And it took me like three weeks to unpack that because who gets questioned about</v>

368
00:14:36.791 --> 00:14:37.481
<v Speaker 1>Pronoun use?</v>

369
00:14:37.481 --> 00:14:39.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why the hell I use the pronouns I use,</v>

370
00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:41.500
<v Speaker 1>I use them because they're part of the language I use.</v>

371
00:14:41.501 --> 00:14:41.921
<v Speaker 1>He and she,</v>

372
00:14:41.921 --> 00:14:43.330
<v Speaker 1>because that's what everyone uses.</v>

373
00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:44.950
<v Speaker 1>And so then I had to think about,</v>

374
00:14:44.951 --> 00:14:45.700
<v Speaker 1>well why,</v>

375
00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.500
<v Speaker 1>why do we in fact use pronouns?</v>

376
00:14:47.501 --> 00:14:50.740
<v Speaker 1>And we use them in part for the same reason that we use other categories.</v>

377
00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:53.360
<v Speaker 1>And that's to simplify the world for functional purposes.</v>

378
00:14:53.361 --> 00:14:54.200
<v Speaker 1>Roughly speaking.</v>

379
00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:55.670
<v Speaker 1>But then I was thinking,</v>

380
00:14:55.671 --> 00:14:56.060
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

381
00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:58.460
<v Speaker 1>is the use of he and she a mark of respect?</v>

382
00:14:58.461 --> 00:14:59.690
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is,</v>

383
00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:00.381
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>

384
00:15:00.381 --> 00:15:01.850
<v Speaker 1>it's not a mark of respect.</v>

385
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.210
<v Speaker 1>It can't be a mark of risk.</v>

386
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:07.310
<v Speaker 1>What you call 4 billion people can't be a mark of respect.</v>

387
00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:07.610
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

388
00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:07.810
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

389
00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:11.450
<v Speaker 1>it's a mark of basic categorization and so then the claim comes up,</v>

390
00:15:11.451 --> 00:15:14.150
<v Speaker 1>well if someone wants you to use a particular Pronoun,</v>

391
00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:15.560
<v Speaker 1>then you're disrespecting them.</v>

392
00:15:15.561 --> 00:15:16.191
<v Speaker 1>If you don't,</v>

393
00:15:16.191 --> 00:15:16.670
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

394
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:17.030
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>

395
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.690
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

396
00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:18.890
<v Speaker 1>let's think that through a bit.</v>

397
00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.410
<v Speaker 1>Well that assumes that when I'm using he or she for,</v>

398
00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:22.580
<v Speaker 1>for people and you know,</v>

399
00:15:22.581 --> 00:15:25.790
<v Speaker 1>in normal parlance that I'm actually indicating my respect for them.</v>

400
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:26.990
<v Speaker 1>And that's not true.</v>

401
00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:27.651
<v Speaker 1>It's like if,</v>

402
00:15:27.651 --> 00:15:28.461
<v Speaker 1>I don't know you,</v>

403
00:15:28.461 --> 00:15:33.350
<v Speaker 1>iCloud is classify you generically and basically I classify you in terms of how</v>

404
00:15:33.351 --> 00:15:35.030
<v Speaker 1>you present yourself publicly.</v>

405
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:39.080
<v Speaker 1>I suppose that's your gender expression and then I nail you with whatever</v>

406
00:15:39.081 --> 00:15:40.340
<v Speaker 1>pronoun seems to fit.</v>

407
00:15:40.341 --> 00:15:41.750
<v Speaker 1>It has nothing to do with respect.</v>

408
00:15:41.751 --> 00:15:42.584
<v Speaker 1>And besides that,</v>

409
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:45.230
<v Speaker 1>you bloody well don't get to demand my respect.</v>

410
00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:46.340
<v Speaker 1>Why should you?</v>

411
00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:47.121
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

412
00:15:47.121 --> 00:15:47.511
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

413
00:15:47.511 --> 00:15:49.190
<v Speaker 1>it's not like I respect everyone.</v>

414
00:15:49.191 --> 00:15:50.540
<v Speaker 1>That's a foolish thing to do.</v>

415
00:15:50.541 --> 00:15:52.670
<v Speaker 1>You respect people who are respectable.</v>

416
00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:53.151
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

417
00:15:53.151 --> 00:15:53.480
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

418
00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:57.230
<v Speaker 1>you make value distinctions between people and that doesn't mean you illegally</v>

419
00:15:57.231 --> 00:15:58.580
<v Speaker 1>discriminate against them.</v>

420
00:15:58.581 --> 00:15:59.780
<v Speaker 1>Those aren't the same thing,</v>

421
00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.780
<v Speaker 1>but I'm all for value judgements,</v>

422
00:16:01.781 --> 00:16:04.970
<v Speaker 1>so don't tell me that I'm not respecting people and I don't use their gender</v>

423
00:16:04.971 --> 00:16:05.361
<v Speaker 1>pronouns.</v>

424
00:16:05.361 --> 00:16:09.020
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing is I don't buy this whole idea that the people who are</v>

425
00:16:09.021 --> 00:16:13.490
<v Speaker 1>putting this legislation forward are valid representatives of the Trans</v>

426
00:16:13.491 --> 00:16:14.150
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

427
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:15.680
<v Speaker 1>That's what they say they are.</v>

428
00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:19.580
<v Speaker 1>We have mechanisms for deciding whether someone's a valid representative of a</v>

429
00:16:19.581 --> 00:16:22.100
<v Speaker 1>community and that generally involves democratic voting.</v>

430
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:26.810
<v Speaker 1>I've received at least 20 letters from transsexual people who are on my side and</v>

431
00:16:26.811 --> 00:16:27.261
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

432
00:16:27.261 --> 00:16:28.580
<v Speaker 1>zero from others,</v>

433
00:16:28.581 --> 00:16:29.420
<v Speaker 1>believe it or not,</v>

434
00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:32.900
<v Speaker 1>who are perfectly happy with the idea of gendered pronouns.</v>

435
00:16:32.901 --> 00:16:34.580
<v Speaker 1>It's just they want to be the other one.</v>

436
00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:37.940
<v Speaker 1>Now you can have a discussion about that and there's lots of things to be said</v>

437
00:16:37.941 --> 00:16:38.301
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>

438
00:16:38.301 --> 00:16:41.930
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that this community that's coming out in these demanding these</v>

439
00:16:41.931 --> 00:16:46.190
<v Speaker 1>rights is somehow representative of this homogenous oppressed minority I think</v>

440
00:16:46.191 --> 00:16:48.660
<v Speaker 1>is rubbish is professor Peterson,</v>

441
00:16:48.661 --> 00:16:49.320
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

442
00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:53.460
<v Speaker 1>As a clinical psychologist refusing to acknowledge how damaging it could</v>

443
00:16:53.461 --> 00:16:57.120
<v Speaker 1>potentially be to an individual to disregard their identity.</v>

444
00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:02.280
<v Speaker 1>It's a very difficult question to even engage with because I don't understand</v>

445
00:17:02.281 --> 00:17:02.880
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

446
00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:03.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand it.</v>

447
00:17:03.961 --> 00:17:07.200
<v Speaker 1>It makes things so simple that you can discuss them properly.</v>

448
00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:11.400
<v Speaker 1>All I do in my clinical practice and I have about 20,000 hours of experience</v>

449
00:17:11.401 --> 00:17:15.360
<v Speaker 1>with clinical in my clinical practice and I've dealt with all sorts of people,</v>

450
00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:19.590
<v Speaker 1>far more variation in people than the typical person ever encounters and I think</v>

451
00:17:19.591 --> 00:17:22.290
<v Speaker 1>I've done it at least reasonably competently.</v>

452
00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:26.190
<v Speaker 1>All my discussions with people in my clinical practice or about their identity</v>

453
00:17:26.370 --> 00:17:29.040
<v Speaker 1>given the definition of identity that I brought forth,</v>

454
00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:30.420
<v Speaker 1>how they feel about themselves,</v>

455
00:17:30.421 --> 00:17:33.000
<v Speaker 1>how they conceptualize themselves cause those are two different things.</v>

456
00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:36.570
<v Speaker 1>How that plays out in their interactions with other people and what the</v>

457
00:17:36.571 --> 00:17:38.940
<v Speaker 1>functional significance of that is and I'm,</v>

458
00:17:38.941 --> 00:17:40.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to save forthrightly.</v>

459
00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:41.251
<v Speaker 1>Well two things.</v>

460
00:17:41.251 --> 00:17:45.390
<v Speaker 1>One is that I don't believe that any of my clients have had cause to worry about</v>

461
00:17:45.391 --> 00:17:46.890
<v Speaker 1>my interpretation of their identity.</v>

462
00:17:46.891 --> 00:17:50.070
<v Speaker 1>Because what I do in my practice is help them what that is.</v>

463
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:50.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm really,</v>

464
00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:55.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm seriously not interested in imposing any ideas of identity on to someone.</v>

465
00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.880
<v Speaker 1>It's because I don't,</v>

466
00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:57.871
<v Speaker 1>I can't do that.</v>

467
00:17:57.871 --> 00:18:01.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the right vehicle is for you to travel through life.</v>

468
00:18:01.651 --> 00:18:03.720
<v Speaker 1>What I can help you do is articulate your concerns.</v>

469
00:18:03.721 --> 00:18:06.440
<v Speaker 1>I can ask you questions where I see contradictions in yourself.</v>

470
00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:07.373
<v Speaker 1>Articulation.</v>

471
00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.480
<v Speaker 1>I can help you make plans for the future.</v>

472
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:12.510
<v Speaker 1>And I've helped thousands and thousands and thousands of people by the way,</v>

473
00:18:12.511 --> 00:18:14.940
<v Speaker 1>make plans for the future with the stuff that I do online.</v>

474
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:17.940
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm helping people build a genuine identity.</v>

475
00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.033
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

476
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.321
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

477
00:18:19.321 --> 00:18:20.190
<v Speaker 1>and that's what I do.</v>

478
00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:22.830
<v Speaker 1>So that's the answer to that question.</v>

479
00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:23.110
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

480
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:24.150
<v Speaker 1>and I think I do it well.</v>

481
00:18:24.151 --> 00:18:24.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean in,</v>

482
00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:27.810
<v Speaker 1>in stuff we've done from a research perspective with the future authoring</v>

483
00:18:27.811 --> 00:18:28.201
<v Speaker 1>program,</v>

484
00:18:28.201 --> 00:18:32.340
<v Speaker 1>which I offered to people free a week and a half ago to help them catalyze their</v>

485
00:18:32.341 --> 00:18:33.174
<v Speaker 1>identities.</v>

486
00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:38.330
<v Speaker 1>We've helped 5,000 university students increase their grade point average 20%</v>

487
00:18:38.641 --> 00:18:40.830
<v Speaker 1>and decrease their dropout by the same.</v>

488
00:18:40.831 --> 00:18:43.290
<v Speaker 1>And the biggest effect has been with men and,</v>

489
00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:48.180
<v Speaker 1>and on Western ethnic minority students who've accelerated their performance up</v>

490
00:18:48.181 --> 00:18:50.160
<v Speaker 1>beyond the range of the normal for the,</v>

491
00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:51.240
<v Speaker 1>for the dominant culture,</v>

492
00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:53.130
<v Speaker 1>a pure psychological intervention,</v>

493
00:18:53.131 --> 00:18:53.611
<v Speaker 1>I might say,</v>

494
00:18:53.611 --> 00:18:55.200
<v Speaker 1>a not a sociological intervention.</v>

495
00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:59.940
<v Speaker 1>So I'm perfectly willing to stack my record on identity formulation up against</v>

496
00:18:59.941 --> 00:19:00.331
<v Speaker 1>anyone.</v>

497
00:19:00.331 --> 00:19:01.350
<v Speaker 1>So and so,</v>

498
00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:04.830
<v Speaker 1>and I should also point out that I think where I'm most vulnerable in this</v>

499
00:19:04.831 --> 00:19:07.560
<v Speaker 1>entire debate and I expect this will happen and you know,</v>

500
00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:10.710
<v Speaker 1>there's already been noise about it on the Ontario Psychological Association</v>

501
00:19:10.711 --> 00:19:11.430
<v Speaker 1>website.</v>

502
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:14.640
<v Speaker 1>I think that they'll probably come after my clinical license,</v>

503
00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:15.801
<v Speaker 1>so that,</v>

504
00:19:15.801 --> 00:19:16.440
<v Speaker 1>that'd be my,</v>

505
00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:17.340
<v Speaker 1>that'd be my guess.</v>

506
00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:18.360
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

507
00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:22.050
<v Speaker 1>So I think we might be straying a little away from your question now.</v>

508
00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:22.710
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

509
00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:22.891
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

510
00:19:22.891 --> 00:19:23.430
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

511
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:23.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

512
00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:24.300
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

513
00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:25.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

514
00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:25.690
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

515
00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:26.261
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

516
00:19:26.261 --> 00:19:28.510
<v Speaker 2>We're doing because that's that question</v>

517
00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:31.120
<v Speaker 1>question involved my clinical practice.</v>

518
00:19:31.121 --> 00:19:35.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm not straying a bit that involved my clinical practice and there was a reason</v>

519
00:19:35.261 --> 00:19:38.000
<v Speaker 1>that the question was posed so I'm not straying.</v>

520
00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:39.963
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

521
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:43.570
<v Speaker 2>Why</v>

522
00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:47.770
<v Speaker 1>do you feel that someone's personal gender identity and pronouns infringes your</v>

523
00:19:47.771 --> 00:19:48.730
<v Speaker 1>free speech?</v>

524
00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:53.800
<v Speaker 1>Can one not also argue based on your interpretation that professors can use</v>

525
00:19:53.801 --> 00:19:55.780
<v Speaker 1>racial slurs in their classroom,</v>

526
00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:56.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

527
00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:57.093
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

528
00:19:57.210 --> 00:20:01.300
<v Speaker 1>that the inability to do so would violate their freedom of speech?</v>

529
00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:01.961
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

530
00:20:01.961 --> 00:20:03.550
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty much the same question.</v>

531
00:20:03.551 --> 00:20:04.384
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

532
00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:05.583
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

533
00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:11.040
<v Speaker 1>I think that we're crossing a dangerous line and the line is the requirement</v>

534
00:20:11.201 --> 00:20:15.610
<v Speaker 1>that's being put upon people by government agencies with the full force of the</v>

535
00:20:15.611 --> 00:20:20.611
<v Speaker 1>law behind them to decide what language categories you're going to use.</v>

536
00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:22.450
<v Speaker 1>When I opened this debate,</v>

537
00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:23.793
<v Speaker 1>this forum,</v>

538
00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:24.713
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

539
00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:27.940
<v Speaker 1>I tried to explain what this is about and I couldn't explain everything and that</v>

540
00:20:27.941 --> 00:20:28.331
<v Speaker 1>it's about,</v>

541
00:20:28.331 --> 00:20:29.710
<v Speaker 1>because it's about too many things.</v>

542
00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:35.460
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things it's about is it theology and the distinction between the</v>

543
00:20:36.371 --> 00:20:38.020
<v Speaker 1>left and the right and let's say no.</v>

544
00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:42.910
<v Speaker 1>I truly believe that these made up pronouns,</v>

545
00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:46.480
<v Speaker 1>of which there are many dozens in fact,</v>

546
00:20:46.481 --> 00:20:47.890
<v Speaker 1>and there's no on them.</v>

547
00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:48.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

548
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:49.000
<v Speaker 1>With just going to ask,</v>

549
00:20:49.001 --> 00:20:54.001
<v Speaker 1>if you could go back to the point about the analogy between the racial slur and</v>

550
00:20:54.641 --> 00:20:55.340
<v Speaker 1>the take.</v>

551
00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:56.770
<v Speaker 1>There's any analogy at all,</v>

552
00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:00.880
<v Speaker 1>but that's just what difference here I'm talking about compelled speech.</v>

553
00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:04.840
<v Speaker 1>There's a difference between saying that there's something you can't say and</v>

554
00:21:04.841 --> 00:21:07.570
<v Speaker 1>seeing that there are things that you have to say,</v>

555
00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.180
<v Speaker 1>and I regard these made up pronouns,</v>

556
00:21:10.181 --> 00:21:15.181
<v Speaker 1>all of them as the neologisms of a radical PC authoritarians.</v>

557
00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:17.800
<v Speaker 1>Do you understand that?</v>

558
00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:18.580
<v Speaker 1>And I don't,</v>

559
00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:20.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a fan of that sort of person.</v>

560
00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:24.730
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I'm not a fan of that sort of person is because I've done my</v>

561
00:21:24.731 --> 00:21:25.564
<v Speaker 1>homework.</v>

562
00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:29.290
