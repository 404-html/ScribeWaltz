00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.890
<v Speaker 1>I was wondering what you saw with Santa Clause,</v>

2
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.800
<v Speaker 1>if it's a healthy thing for parents to practice,</v>

3
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.370
<v Speaker 1>what's the psychological impact of lying to your child?</v>

4
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:17.683
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

5
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:18.853
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>

6
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.980
<v Speaker 1>I think lying is the wrong way of thinking about this.</v>

7
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.630
<v Speaker 1>Santa Claus is a game.</v>

8
00:00:23.631 --> 00:00:27.890
<v Speaker 1>It's a game of pretend and children play games of pretend all the time,</v>

9
00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.701
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:28.701 --> 00:00:31.520
<v Speaker 1>so I don't see any harm in that at all.</v>

11
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:32.030
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

12
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.331
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:32.331 --> 00:00:37.331
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to prolong that belief beyond its natural end point.</v>

14
00:00:38.061 --> 00:00:38.750
<v Speaker 1>But it's a,</v>

15
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.160
<v Speaker 1>it's a massive game and it's a lovely game and I don't believe that there's</v>

16
00:00:43.161 --> 00:00:45.320
<v Speaker 1>anything harmful in it in the least.</v>

17
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.610
<v Speaker 1>So now what's the psychological impact of lying to your child?</v>

18
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.100
<v Speaker 1>Let's we can think about that more generally.</v>

19
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.540
<v Speaker 1>Don't lie to your children.</v>

20
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:54.741
<v Speaker 1>Don't lie.</v>

21
00:00:54.741 --> 00:00:55.430
<v Speaker 1>Period.</v>

22
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.080
<v Speaker 1>Lying is a really bad idea.</v>

23
00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.460
<v Speaker 1>It's a really bad idea.</v>

24
00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:59.570
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

25
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:00.710
<v Speaker 1>it never works.</v>

26
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:01.880
<v Speaker 1>You might think it works,</v>

27
00:01:01.881 --> 00:01:05.360
<v Speaker 1>but that's only because you're blind to the consequences and probably willfully</v>

28
00:01:05.361 --> 00:01:06.050
<v Speaker 1>blind.</v>

29
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.430
<v Speaker 1>Plus it's a terrible weight.</v>

30
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.671
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

31
00:01:07.671 --> 00:01:08.300
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

32
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.200
<v Speaker 1>if you don't lie,</v>

33
00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:11.030
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot fewer things to keep track of.</v>

34
00:01:11.031 --> 00:01:14.300
<v Speaker 1>Your life is a lot more pristine and crystally and,</v>

35
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.470
<v Speaker 1>and then things that you,</v>

36
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.740
<v Speaker 1>that come your way maybe you deserve in some small measure.</v>

37
00:01:21.741 --> 00:01:24.500
<v Speaker 1>And it's a bad idea to lie now,</v>

38
00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:27.580
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think it's a bad idea to play pretend games with your children.</v>

39
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.460
<v Speaker 1>I think that's okay.</v>
