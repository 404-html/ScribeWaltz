Any reading tips for becoming teachers who don't want to be corrupted by the

2
00:00:10.681 --> 00:00:13.020
current teacher education at the universities?

3
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:13.471
Well,

4
00:00:13.471 --> 00:00:14.101
I would say,

5
00:00:14.101 --> 00:00:14.401
you know,

6
00:00:14.401 --> 00:00:14.880
you can,

7
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.470
I have a reading list on my book,

8
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.490
on my website,

9
00:00:17.491 --> 00:00:19.740
Jordan B peterson.com you could go look there.

10
00:00:19.741 --> 00:00:24.030
I'm going to add some more books to read as much classic literature as you can

11
00:00:24.031 --> 00:00:24.930
read history,

12
00:00:24.931 --> 00:00:27.330
like going to the libraries and,

13
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:27.900
and,

14
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.610
and look at great books,

15
00:00:29.611 --> 00:00:30.360
programs.

16
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.370
That's what I would say.

17
00:00:31.371 --> 00:00:34.260
And you have to educate yourself at the university,

18
00:00:34.261 --> 00:00:34.561
you know,

19
00:00:34.561 --> 00:00:34.831
I mean,

20
00:00:34.831 --> 00:00:38.280
that's always been the case and it's even more the case now is,

21
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.391
is,

22
00:00:39.391 --> 00:00:40.224
uh,

23
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.670
go back and go back and read great literature,

24
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.630
Great Philosophy,

25
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.590
great thinkers,

26
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.320
and you'll learn a tremendous amount that way.

27
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.420
And I think otherwise,

28
00:00:51.421 --> 00:00:54.120
there's no way you couldn't avoid being corrupted by the current teacher

29
00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:55.350
education at universities.

30
00:00:55.351 --> 00:00:57.900
The education faculties are absolutely dreadful.

31
00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.160
Absolutely dreadful.

32
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.593
So,

33
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.150
<v 2>okay.</v>
