1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.950
<v Speaker 1>You cite a tired brain,</v>

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.090
<v Speaker 1>foggy thinking as the reason to stop answering questions or giving a talk.</v>

3
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.970
<v Speaker 1>How do you combat this well working or writing daily?</v>

4
00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:10.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:11.183
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

6
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.790
<v Speaker 1>I eat a big breakfast relatively soon on waking.</v>

7
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.900
<v Speaker 1>That really helps.</v>

8
00:00:15.901 --> 00:00:19.590
<v Speaker 1>If any of you out there are anxious and many of you no doubt are,</v>

9
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.250
<v Speaker 1>there'll be a large number of you who are anxious and don't eat breakfast and</v>

10
00:00:23.251 --> 00:00:24.750
<v Speaker 1>there'll be a whole bunch of you out there who think,</v>

11
00:00:24.751 --> 00:00:24.871
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

12
00:00:24.871 --> 00:00:25.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't eat breakfast.</v>

13
00:00:25.711 --> 00:00:26.491
<v Speaker 1>It isn't necessary.</v>

14
00:00:26.491 --> 00:00:26.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

15
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:27.690
<v Speaker 1>that's wrong.</v>

16
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:28.800
<v Speaker 1>It's necessary.</v>

17
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.180
<v Speaker 1>You fasted all night.</v>

18
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.780
<v Speaker 1>If you load yourself cognitively or physiologically in the morning,</v>

19
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.270
<v Speaker 1>your brain stressed will produce,</v>

20
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:37.230
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

21
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.390
<v Speaker 1>will encourage your body to produce insulin.</v>

22
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.080
<v Speaker 1>It will take all the blood sugar out of your blood and then you're done for the</v>

23
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.640
<v Speaker 1>day and then you'll be anxious.</v>

24
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.740
<v Speaker 1>And another lot of the rest of you too,</v>

25
00:00:46.741 --> 00:00:47.940
<v Speaker 1>you'll find if you're anxious,</v>

26
00:00:47.941 --> 00:00:48.480
<v Speaker 1>try this.</v>

27
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.111
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>

28
00:00:49.111 --> 00:00:50.010
<v Speaker 1>really interesting.</v>

29
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.023
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

30
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.953
<v Speaker 1>experiment.</v>

31
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.060
<v Speaker 1>The next time you're anxious,</v>

32
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.050
<v Speaker 1>go eat something.</v>

33
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.303
<v Speaker 1>Eat like,</v>

34
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.440
<v Speaker 1>eat some protein and fat would be best.</v>

35
00:00:58.441 --> 00:00:59.730
<v Speaker 1>You could have cheese and crackers.</v>

36
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a big fan of carbohydrates,</v>

37
00:01:01.411 --> 00:01:02.244
<v Speaker 1>but whatever.</v>

38
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.230
<v Speaker 1>Eat whatever you're willing to eat,</v>

39
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.280
<v Speaker 1>but make it solid.</v>

40
00:01:05.281 --> 00:01:08.460
<v Speaker 1>Don't eat a peanut butter or don't eat a chocolate bar or something sweet.</v>

41
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:09.960
<v Speaker 1>Eat something substantial,</v>

42
00:01:09.961 --> 00:01:10.591
<v Speaker 1>a piece of meat,</v>

43
00:01:10.591 --> 00:01:11.490
<v Speaker 1>a piece of cheese,</v>

44
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.570
<v Speaker 1>some peanut butter,</v>

45
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.530
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

46
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.030
<v Speaker 1>and then wait 10 minutes and see if you're less anxious and tried out for like</v>

47
00:01:18.031 --> 00:01:18.601
<v Speaker 1>two weeks.</v>

48
00:01:18.601 --> 00:01:19.590
<v Speaker 1>Every time you get anxious,</v>

49
00:01:19.591 --> 00:01:22.830
<v Speaker 1>eat something because then you can find out if you're anxious,</v>

50
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.880
<v Speaker 1>if your anxiety is linked to low blood sugar and it's very likely that it is,</v>

51
00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:31.320
<v Speaker 1>especially if you also get irritable and foggy in your thinking and so,</v>

52
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.280
<v Speaker 1>and the best way to treat that as far as I've been able to tell,</v>

53
00:01:35.281 --> 00:01:36.660
<v Speaker 1>and there's a decent literature on this,</v>

54
00:01:36.661 --> 00:01:39.570
<v Speaker 1>is to make sure that you eat a big breakfast and you might say,</v>

55
00:01:39.571 --> 00:01:39.751
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

56
00:01:39.751 --> 00:01:40.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm not hungry in the morning.</v>

57
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:41.011
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

58
00:01:41.011 --> 00:01:42.540
<v Speaker 1>who the hell cares if you're hungry?</v>

59
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.670
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say enjoy your breakfast.</v>

60
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.631
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

61
00:01:45.631 --> 00:01:46.050
<v Speaker 1>eat it.</v>

62
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.310
<v Speaker 1>That's not the same thing.</v>

63
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.730
<v Speaker 1>You know there's lots of things that you need to do that you don't enjoy to</v>

64
00:01:50.731 --> 00:01:51.181
<v Speaker 1>begin with.</v>

65
00:01:51.181 --> 00:01:53.670
<v Speaker 1>You'll get hungry in six months and then you'll start to enjoy it.</v>

66
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.560
<v Speaker 1>So that's a massive difference.</v>

67
00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.810
<v Speaker 1>I take small naps quite frequently.</v>

68
00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.130
<v Speaker 1>If I'm wiped out,</v>

69
00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.761
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

70
00:01:59.761 --> 00:02:04.200
<v Speaker 1>I'll go have a nap for 10 minutes or 15 minutes and then that helps quite a lot.</v>

71
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:05.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

72
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.940
<v Speaker 1>I try to wake up fairly regular,</v>

73
00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.590
<v Speaker 1>a lot on a fairly regular schedule.</v>

74
00:02:10.591 --> 00:02:13.680
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing I would really recommend for people whose lives are in</v>

75
00:02:13.681 --> 00:02:15.000
<v Speaker 1>disarray and who are anxious.</v>

76
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.310
<v Speaker 1>Try to fix your wake time,</v>

77
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.750
<v Speaker 1>sleep going when you sleep.</v>

78
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.040
<v Speaker 1>That's not so important.</v>

79
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.090
<v Speaker 1>So you can still,</v>

80
00:02:21.091 --> 00:02:21.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

81
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.310
<v Speaker 1>stay up late and have fun and all that.</v>

82
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.440
<v Speaker 1>But getting up in the morning is really helpful.</v>

83
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.173
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

84
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.313
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

85
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:29.191
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

86
00:02:29.191 --> 00:02:29.501
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>

87
00:02:29.501 --> 00:02:32.310
<v Speaker 1>you also have to figure out how much you can work or write.</v>

88
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.040
<v Speaker 1>I can't write for more than about Max.</v>

89
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.490
<v Speaker 1>My sustainable maximum for writing is three hours a day.</v>

90
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.350
<v Speaker 1>And if I push it past that,</v>

91
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.830
<v Speaker 1>then especially if I'm editing,</v>

92
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.260
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

93
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.820
<v Speaker 1>I make mistakes when I'm editing.</v>

94
00:02:44.821 --> 00:02:48.240
<v Speaker 1>So that's counterproductive and I can't sustain it across time.</v>

95
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.010
<v Speaker 1>And so I don't really think you can do more than about three hours of extremely</v>

96
00:02:53.011 --> 00:02:54.780
<v Speaker 1>intense intellectual work a day.</v>

97
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.010
<v Speaker 1>Although if you have a nap,</v>

98
00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:57.450
<v Speaker 1>you can stretch that.</v>

99
00:02:57.451 --> 00:03:00.370
<v Speaker 1>But I think at least I up paying for it across time.</v>

100
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.530
<v Speaker 1>So nap,</v>

101
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:03.790
<v Speaker 1>make sure you eat,</v>

102
00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.870
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

103
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.840
<v Speaker 1>and make sure you eat protein and fat and not carbohydrates because</v>

104
00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:09.640
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates are basically poisonous.</v>

105
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.833
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

106
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.260
<v Speaker 1>that's about,</v>

107
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.360
<v Speaker 1>that's about and make sure that you get enough sleep.</v>

108
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:17.290
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

109
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.800
<v Speaker 1>that's how I combat it and try to make myself hyper efficient,</v>

110
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.960
<v Speaker 1>which is also a really interesting thing to try.</v>

111
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:24.130
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

112
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.320
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to my agents at CAA,</v>

113
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.550
<v Speaker 1>creative artists agency in La and I just hired a publicist to,</v>

114
00:03:29.551 --> 00:03:32.770
<v Speaker 1>to help me manage media in a more intelligent manner.</v>

115
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.590
<v Speaker 1>And we're trying to think about our overarching philosophy.</v>

116
00:03:35.591 --> 00:03:40.570
<v Speaker 1>You know when I first proposed to the CA guys that are overarching philosophy</v>

117
00:03:40.571 --> 00:03:41.530
<v Speaker 1>would be something like,</v>

118
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.910
<v Speaker 1>cause you need an overarching philosophy under which you nest all your specific</v>

119
00:03:45.911 --> 00:03:46.361
<v Speaker 1>actions.</v>

120
00:03:46.361 --> 00:03:50.260
<v Speaker 1>It was something like to educate as many people as possible in the shortest</v>

121
00:03:50.261 --> 00:03:51.094
<v Speaker 1>period of time,</v>

122
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.600
<v Speaker 1>which seems like a really good goal.</v>

123
00:03:52.601 --> 00:03:52.781
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

124
00:03:52.781 --> 00:03:54.040
<v Speaker 1>why the hell not do that?</v>

125
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.200
<v Speaker 1>But then we broadened out a little bit this week,</v>

126
00:03:56.201 --> 00:04:00.970
<v Speaker 1>which was to try to do as much good possible as efficiently as possible and that</v>

127
00:04:00.971 --> 00:04:02.410
<v Speaker 1>efficiency thing is really fun.</v>

128
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.840
<v Speaker 1>If you guys who are listening are out for a challenge,</v>

129
00:04:04.841 --> 00:04:06.670
<v Speaker 1>like one of the things that you can,</v>

130
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.090
<v Speaker 1>I think this heightens the meaning in your life is to try to do difficult</v>

131
00:04:10.091 --> 00:04:10.750
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

132
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:11.110
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

133
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.943
<v Speaker 1>Aim High,</v>

134
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.360
<v Speaker 1>don't name so damn high you can't manage it and make sure you break down your</v>

135
00:04:16.361 --> 00:04:19.510
<v Speaker 1>aims into reasonably attainable sub goals,</v>

136
00:04:19.511 --> 00:04:22.780
<v Speaker 1>but you want to aim high and then you want to see how hyper efficient you can</v>

137
00:04:22.781 --> 00:04:23.350
<v Speaker 1>get.</v>

138
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.410
<v Speaker 1>That's a great thing to do in your early twenties is to see,</v>

139
00:04:26.411 --> 00:04:26.711
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

140
00:04:26.711 --> 00:04:28.300
<v Speaker 1>like discipline yourself.</v>

141
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.751
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>

142
00:04:28.751 --> 00:04:28.991
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

143
00:04:28.991 --> 00:04:32.470
<v Speaker 1>how much work can I do if I load myself right to the maximum?</v>

144
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:33.970
<v Speaker 1>How far do I,</v>

145
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.110
<v Speaker 1>how far can I work?</v>

146
00:04:35.111 --> 00:04:38.170
<v Speaker 1>How hard can I work until I exhaust myself?</v>

147
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.120
<v Speaker 1>And then you back off obviously because the optimal amount of working productive</v>

148
00:04:43.121 --> 00:04:43.661
<v Speaker 1>engagement,</v>

149
00:04:43.661 --> 00:04:44.440
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

150
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.350
<v Speaker 1>is that which is sustainable across decades.</v>

151
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.980
<v Speaker 1>So you have to,</v>

152
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:48.910
<v Speaker 1>you have to learn that,</v>

153
00:04:48.911 --> 00:04:52.000
<v Speaker 1>but you don't learn that without stretching yourself to your limits to begin</v>

154
00:04:52.001 --> 00:04:52.660
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

155
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:53.171
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

156
00:04:53.171 --> 00:04:55.000
<v Speaker 1>if your life isn't everything it could be,</v>

157
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.790
<v Speaker 1>and if you're suffering from an excess of meaninglessness,</v>

158
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.360
<v Speaker 1>well it means you're not oriented in the world of chaos and order properly.</v>

159
00:05:01.361 --> 00:05:03.190
<v Speaker 1>It's like you could learn to discipline yourself,</v>

160
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.541
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

161
00:05:04.541 --> 00:05:05.470
<v Speaker 1>figure out what,</v>

162
00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:08.530
<v Speaker 1>figure out what it is that you need to do and that you want to do and then see</v>

163
00:05:08.531 --> 00:05:09.640
<v Speaker 1>how efficient you can get.</v>

164
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.600
<v Speaker 1>Because one of the things that's quite fun is to figure out if you have a task,</v>

165
00:05:13.601 --> 00:05:15.160
<v Speaker 1>I always tell my graduate students this,</v>

166
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.660
<v Speaker 1>if they're doing an experiment too,</v>

167
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.940
<v Speaker 1>if you have a task that you have to do,</v>

168
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.940
<v Speaker 1>it's really interesting to spend a few minutes,</v>

169
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.930
<v Speaker 1>sometimes hours,</v>

170
00:05:22.931 --> 00:05:24.460
<v Speaker 1>depending on how long the task is.</v>

171
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.510
<v Speaker 1>See if you can figure out how to do it from,</v>

172
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.360
<v Speaker 1>from five to 10 times faster.</v>

173
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.090
<v Speaker 1>It means you'll have to rearrange the way you think about it,</v>

174
00:05:31.091 --> 00:05:34.420
<v Speaker 1>but you can often do it and that's how extremely productive people get.</v>

175
00:05:34.421 --> 00:05:35.410
<v Speaker 1>So hyper efficient,</v>

176
00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.831
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

177
00:05:35.831 --> 00:05:37.420
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it means you have to delegate.</v>

178
00:05:37.421 --> 00:05:39.850
<v Speaker 1>It means sometimes it means you have to bring other people aboard.</v>

179
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.110
<v Speaker 1>That's delegation as well,</v>

180
00:05:41.111 --> 00:05:41.944
<v Speaker 1>I suppose.</v>

181
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.520
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

182
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.450
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of preconceptions that you hold about who you are and who the</v>

183
00:05:46.451 --> 00:05:49.870
<v Speaker 1>world is that you could dispense with that would make you a way more efficient</v>

184
00:05:49.871 --> 00:05:50.740
<v Speaker 1>actor in the world.</v>

185
00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:52.023
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

186
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.580
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

187
00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:53.010
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

188
00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:54.150
<v Speaker 1>So that's that.</v>
