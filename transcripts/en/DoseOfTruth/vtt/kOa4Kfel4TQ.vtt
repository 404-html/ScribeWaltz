00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.240
<v Speaker 1>Especially among the enthusiastic,</v>

2
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.921
<v Speaker 1>and you might,</v>

3
00:00:12.921 --> 00:00:13.371
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

4
00:00:13.371 --> 00:00:13.521
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

5
00:00:13.521 --> 00:00:14.720
<v Speaker 1>you should be enthusiastic.</v>

6
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.590
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

7
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.920
<v Speaker 1>you should be enthusiastic when the probability reward is high,</v>

8
00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.050
<v Speaker 1>probably as you can't tell now,</v>

9
00:00:21.051 --> 00:00:25.160
<v Speaker 1>if everybody's running around doing the probability of reward is high and you're</v>

10
00:00:25.161 --> 00:00:25.881
<v Speaker 1>enthusiastic,</v>

11
00:00:25.881 --> 00:00:28.580
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get caught up in that and then everybody's going to get caught</v>

12
00:00:28.581 --> 00:00:28.911
<v Speaker 1>up in it.</v>

13
00:00:28.911 --> 00:00:33.740
<v Speaker 1>And then the probability of reward is going to be high for a while until you run</v>

14
00:00:33.741 --> 00:00:37.250
<v Speaker 1>out of enthusiastic people and then bang,</v>

15
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.473
<v Speaker 1>game over.</v>

16
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:40.453
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

17
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.900
<v Speaker 1>why are people like that?</v>

18
00:00:41.901 --> 00:00:46.880
<v Speaker 1>While we're great mimics and the fact that we get enthusiastic and imitate each</v>

19
00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:47.091
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

20
00:00:47.091 --> 00:00:48.500
<v Speaker 1>it makes us able to cooperate.</v>

21
00:00:48.501 --> 00:00:50.120
<v Speaker 1>Because like if say you're a leader,</v>

22
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.260
<v Speaker 1>you want it filled me with enthusiasm so I can go off and do impossible things.</v>

23
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:55.820
<v Speaker 1>And that happens sometimes.</v>

24
00:00:55.821 --> 00:00:56.031
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

25
00:00:56.031 --> 00:00:58.140
<v Speaker 1>you can come up with some hair brained,</v>

26
00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:59.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

27
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.190
<v Speaker 1>absurdly optimistic scheme.</v>

28
00:01:01.191 --> 00:01:04.700
<v Speaker 1>Like we'll go to the moon in five years and which is impossible,</v>

29
00:01:04.701 --> 00:01:05.091
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

30
00:01:05.091 --> 00:01:05.810
<v Speaker 1>And then everybody thinks,</v>

31
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.961
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

32
00:01:05.961 --> 00:01:06.771
<v Speaker 1>that would be great.</v>

33
00:01:06.771 --> 00:01:08.600
<v Speaker 1>And there's a huge movement and Poof,</v>

34
00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:09.800
<v Speaker 1>you're on loan in five years.</v>

35
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.300
<v Speaker 1>And it was impossible.</v>

36
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.853
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

37
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.390
<v Speaker 1>you could say Kennedy was a self deceiver when he said it.</v>

38
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.260
<v Speaker 1>You could say that,</v>

39
00:01:18.261 --> 00:01:19.610
<v Speaker 1>except in retrospect,</v>

40
00:01:19.611 --> 00:01:20.720
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't cause it worked.</v>

41
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.790
<v Speaker 1>And that was all enthusiasm too,</v>

42
00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:24.170
<v Speaker 1>and a bubble in a sense</v>

43
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.103
<v Speaker 2>that worked.</v>

44
00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.830
<v Speaker 1>So there's no simple way out of these things.</v>

45
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:30.970
<v Speaker 1>It's disruptive.</v>

46
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.190
<v Speaker 1>And you know what happens to,</v>

47
00:01:33.191 --> 00:01:35.500
<v Speaker 1>if you let your kids have fun out of control,</v>

48
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:36.820
<v Speaker 1>sooner or later,</v>

49
00:01:36.821 --> 00:01:40.570
<v Speaker 1>one of them bangs their head on a table or falls down the stairs or gives</v>

50
00:01:40.571 --> 00:01:41.830
<v Speaker 1>another kid at poker,</v>

51
00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:42.191
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

52
00:01:42.191 --> 00:01:45.610
<v Speaker 1>like it will or break something or you know,</v>

53
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.970
<v Speaker 1>it isn't just that it bothers people.</v>

54
00:01:48.971 --> 00:01:51.190
<v Speaker 1>It's that it's the Dionysian,</v>

55
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.110
<v Speaker 1>it's Dionysian danger.</v>

56
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.220
<v Speaker 1>It's orgastic danger and get too enthusiastic about things.</v>

57
00:01:57.221 --> 00:01:58.090
<v Speaker 1>You get into trouble.</v>

58
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.630
<v Speaker 1>It's not negative emotion that drives teenage pregnancy.</v>

59
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.171
<v Speaker 1>It's impulsive,</v>

60
00:02:04.171 --> 00:02:05.040
<v Speaker 1>positive emotion.</v>

61
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.360
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
