00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:06.671
<v Speaker 1>Hi,</v>

2
00:00:06.671 --> 00:00:07.504
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Peterson,</v>

3
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.760
<v Speaker 1>I would just like to ask you to please talk about what you called a psychic</v>

4
00:00:12.761 --> 00:00:13.120
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>

5
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.650
<v Speaker 1>also known as an ego death.</v>

6
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.570
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

7
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.040
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

8
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:16.873
<v Speaker 2>say that again.</v>

9
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.480
<v Speaker 1>Would you please talk about what young referred to as a psychic death also</v>

10
00:00:21.481 --> 00:00:22.440
<v Speaker 1>called an ego death.</v>

11
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.330
<v Speaker 2>That's what happens when someone who loves you betrays you.</v>

12
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.280
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

13
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.270
<v Speaker 2>So imagine that</v>

14
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.010
<v Speaker 2>the world is complicated beyond comprehension,</v>

15
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.490
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

16
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.240
<v Speaker 2>When you only see a very little bit of it and the way you structure your</v>

17
00:00:39.241 --> 00:00:42.840
<v Speaker 2>understanding is you make assumptions about things and they're simplifying</v>

18
00:00:42.841 --> 00:00:43.331
<v Speaker 2>assumption.</v>

19
00:00:43.331 --> 00:00:45.180
<v Speaker 2>So if you trust someone,</v>

20
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.600
<v Speaker 2>you reduce their complexity massively,</v>

21
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.901
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

22
00:00:48.901 --> 00:00:49.800
<v Speaker 2>Because like,</v>

23
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.270
<v Speaker 2>let's say we were married and there's a whole bunch of ways that you're going to</v>

24
00:00:54.271 --> 00:00:55.980
<v Speaker 2>act that are going to be simpler.</v>

25
00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.391
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

26
00:00:57.391 --> 00:01:00.930
<v Speaker 2>So then I can tolerate being around you in some sense because you're not</v>

27
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.670
<v Speaker 2>everything at once.</v>

28
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.420
<v Speaker 2>Now those simplifying structures are hierarchically assembled and some of them</v>

29
00:01:12.071 --> 00:01:13.630
<v Speaker 2>are far more important than others.</v>

30
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.250
<v Speaker 2>Trust is one of them,</v>

31
00:01:15.251 --> 00:01:16.570
<v Speaker 2>especially trust in loved ones,</v>

32
00:01:16.571 --> 00:01:17.291
<v Speaker 2>family members,</v>

33
00:01:17.291 --> 00:01:20.400
<v Speaker 2>which is why I'd be trailed by a family member is really catastrophic cause it</v>

34
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.470
<v Speaker 2>it an it destabilizes your past,</v>

35
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.950
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

36
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.140
<v Speaker 2>All the memories you have at de stabilizes your present.</v>

37
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.580
<v Speaker 2>It destabilizes your future.</v>

38
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.770
<v Speaker 2>It shakes your faith in human beings,</v>

39
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.040
<v Speaker 2>including yourself and everything collapses.</v>

40
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.480
<v Speaker 2>And that's an ego death.</v>

41
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.580
<v Speaker 2>And so now underneath the ego as far as young was concerned,</v>

42
00:01:39.581 --> 00:01:41.830
<v Speaker 2>was another structure that he called the self.</v>

43
00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.120
<v Speaker 2>And the self is the thing that remains constant across ego deaths,</v>

44
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.973
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

45
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.730
<v Speaker 2>it's deeper and less personal.</v>

46
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.880
<v Speaker 2>It's archetipal and it's the thing that the eagle collapses into when it</v>

47
00:01:56.891 --> 00:01:59.020
<v Speaker 2>collapses and then it rebuilds the ego,</v>

48
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.120
<v Speaker 2>something like that across time.</v>

49
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.430
<v Speaker 2>But that's what an ego death is.</v>

50
00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.470
<v Speaker 2>Now there's variants of that because you can have a voluntary or involuntary ego</v>

51
00:02:08.471 --> 00:02:12.940
<v Speaker 2>death and a voluntary ego death is when you learn a bunch and you're willing to</v>

52
00:02:12.941 --> 00:02:13.774
<v Speaker 2>let go.</v>

53
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.120
<v Speaker 2>So that would be your own immolation.</v>

54
00:02:16.121 --> 00:02:17.110
<v Speaker 2>It's like your lighting,</v>

55
00:02:17.111 --> 00:02:17.231
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

56
00:02:17.231 --> 00:02:19.510
<v Speaker 2>you're a Phoenix and your lighting yourself on fire.</v>

57
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.580
<v Speaker 2>That's a much better idea.</v>

58
00:02:21.581 --> 00:02:23.410
<v Speaker 2>Even though it can still be really harsh,</v>

59
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.110
<v Speaker 2>the involuntary ego desks,</v>

60
00:02:26.111 --> 00:02:27.280
<v Speaker 2>they're really hard on people.</v>

61
00:02:27.281 --> 00:02:30.520
<v Speaker 2>People will do almost anything to stop that from happening,</v>

62
00:02:30.521 --> 00:02:35.521
<v Speaker 2>which is partly why they fight to maintain their group fostered axiomatic</v>

63
00:02:37.421 --> 00:02:38.500
<v Speaker 2>simplifications.</v>

64
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.140
<v Speaker 2>It's not surprising because it's very,</v>

65
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.610
<v Speaker 2>you lose your,</v>

66
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.270
<v Speaker 2>like that ego death is a journey into the underworld or it's a collapse into</v>

67
00:02:46.271 --> 00:02:47.104
<v Speaker 2>chaos.</v>

68
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.120
<v Speaker 2>And that's not so bad if you do it purposefully.</v>

69
00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.070
<v Speaker 2>But in the Pinocchio Story,</v>

70
00:02:51.071 --> 00:02:51.641
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

71
00:02:51.641 --> 00:02:55.060
<v Speaker 2>that's exemplified by Pinocchio going down to the depths to rescue his father</v>

72
00:02:55.061 --> 00:02:55.894
<v Speaker 2>from the whale.</v>

73
00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.160
<v Speaker 2>Now he does that voluntarily,</v>

74
00:02:57.161 --> 00:02:58.210
<v Speaker 2>but it damn near killed him,</v>

75
00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:59.163
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

76
00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.321
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

77
00:02:59.321 --> 00:02:59.741
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

78
00:02:59.741 --> 00:03:01.120
<v Speaker 2>you hardly gets out of the whale.</v>

79
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:02.440
<v Speaker 2>Second,</v>

80
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.300
<v Speaker 2>he actually drowns and dies,</v>

81
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.010
<v Speaker 2>but he comes back to life.</v>

82
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.690
<v Speaker 2>So even if you do it voluntarily,</v>

83
00:03:07.691 --> 00:03:08.524
<v Speaker 2>it's still,</v>

84
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.820
<v Speaker 2>it's just better than doing it in voluntarily,</v>

85
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.200
<v Speaker 2>which is the other alternative.</v>

86
00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:15.310
<v Speaker 2>So that's what it is.</v>

87
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.680
<v Speaker 2>You Bet.</v>
