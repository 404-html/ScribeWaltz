1
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.300
<v Speaker 1>I thought we might close.</v>

2
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.300
<v Speaker 1>I have a question for you about your,</v>

3
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.960
<v Speaker 1>your derivation of these moral virtues specifically from the enlightenment and</v>

4
00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:20.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious about that because,</v>

5
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:21.271
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

6
00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:24.240
<v Speaker 1>first of all you could make a case that it wasn't so much the enlightenment as</v>

7
00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:28.710
<v Speaker 1>it was the specifically the rise of empirical science and then you could of</v>

8
00:00:28.711 --> 00:00:31.110
<v Speaker 1>course have a discussion about how those two things are related.</v>

9
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.610
<v Speaker 1>But I'm also curious,</v>

10
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.470
<v Speaker 1>I've been reading Ian McGilchrist book,</v>

11
00:00:35.471 --> 00:00:37.950
<v Speaker 1>the master and his emissary and Miguel.</v>

12
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.430
<v Speaker 1>Chris makes a pretty strong case.</v>

13
00:00:39.431 --> 00:00:44.431
<v Speaker 1>I would say that yet the rationalistic enlightenment values are in some sense a</v>

14
00:00:44.561 --> 00:00:49.561
<v Speaker 1>consequence of the articulation of an underlying set of principals that are more</v>

15
00:00:51.291 --> 00:00:52.430
<v Speaker 1>metaphoric in nature,</v>

16
00:00:52.431 --> 00:00:53.630
<v Speaker 1>more narrative in nature.</v>

17
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:54.201
<v Speaker 1>The case,</v>

18
00:00:54.201 --> 00:00:57.830
<v Speaker 1>I also made it my book maps of meeting and to some degree in 12 rules for life</v>

19
00:00:57.831 --> 00:00:59.660
<v Speaker 1>that the enlightenment project,</v>

20
00:00:59.661 --> 00:01:04.200
<v Speaker 1>and it's rationalities nested inside a deeper web of metaphor and ritual and</v>

21
00:01:04.201 --> 00:01:09.080
<v Speaker 1>damage that would be associated with longer scale cognitive processes,</v>

22
00:01:09.081 --> 00:01:11.090
<v Speaker 1>some of which are expressed in religious thinking,</v>

23
00:01:11.091 --> 00:01:15.950
<v Speaker 1>but some of which are grounded in not so much rationality as in motivation and</v>

24
00:01:15.951 --> 00:01:16.471
<v Speaker 1>emotion.</v>

25
00:01:16.471 --> 00:01:19.760
<v Speaker 1>And I mean the way your book is structured,</v>

26
00:01:19.761 --> 00:01:24.761
<v Speaker 1>and I think the way enlightenment thinkers think is that there was a miracle of</v>

27
00:01:24.861 --> 00:01:29.630
<v Speaker 1>sorts that occurred sometime in the last three to 500 years and people woke up</v>

28
00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:30.800
<v Speaker 1>and became rational.</v>

29
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.360
<v Speaker 1>And then the question is to what degree was the ground for that awakening</v>

30
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.010
<v Speaker 1>prepared by events that weren't the awakening itself but that were associated</v>

31
00:01:40.011 --> 00:01:41.120
<v Speaker 1>with other processes?</v>

32
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.600
<v Speaker 1>And I'm just curious as to what your thoughts are on that.</v>

33
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.551
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

34
00:01:45.551 --> 00:01:45.910
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

35
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:46.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

36
00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.150
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing new under the sun and a,</v>

37
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.160
<v Speaker 2>I have good intellectual historian can find the antecedents of any intellectual</v>

38
00:01:53.161 --> 00:01:55.200
<v Speaker 2>movement didn't in various precursors.</v>

39
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:56.120
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

40
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

41
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.333
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to,</v>

42
00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:58.380
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

43
00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's a,</v>

44
00:01:59.451 --> 00:02:02.630
<v Speaker 2>a lot in the enlightenment that can specifically be attributed to,</v>

45
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.810
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

46
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:04.590
<v Speaker 2>to uh,</v>

47
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

48
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:05.251
<v Speaker 2>religion,</v>

49
00:02:05.251 --> 00:02:08.310
<v Speaker 2>particularly Christianity just based on the fact that it was already around for</v>

50
00:02:08.311 --> 00:02:10.500
<v Speaker 2>a thousand years and nothing much happened.</v>

51
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.100
<v Speaker 2>So it couldn't be religion itself or Christianity itself.</v>

52
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.180
<v Speaker 2>Although there are as,</v>

53
00:02:15.181 --> 00:02:15.751
<v Speaker 2>as you say,</v>

54
00:02:15.751 --> 00:02:19.200
<v Speaker 2>there are strands that were carried over in particular.</v>

55
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.341
<v Speaker 2>And this is a,</v>

56
00:02:20.341 --> 00:02:21.021
<v Speaker 2>I didn't cite that,</v>

57
00:02:21.021 --> 00:02:23.070
<v Speaker 2>that I got from my other half,</v>

58
00:02:23.071 --> 00:02:23.940
<v Speaker 2>Rebecca Goldstein,</v>

59
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.720
<v Speaker 2>my wife,</v>

60
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

61
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:25.270
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

62
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.491
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

63
00:02:25.491 --> 00:02:25.621
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

64
00:02:25.621 --> 00:02:26.640
<v Speaker 2>you've appeared on stage.</v>

65
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.493
<v Speaker 2>One of it,</v>

66
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.750
<v Speaker 2>one thing that the Greeks didn't have that,</v>

67
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:31.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

68
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.640
<v Speaker 2>the Christianity did,</v>

69
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

70
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.800
<v Speaker 2>was the idea of compassion for the week and,</v>

71
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.850
<v Speaker 2>and universal human flourishing.</v>

72
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.690
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

73
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.420
<v Speaker 2>you don't really have that for all of the brilliance of,</v>

74
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.751
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

75
00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:43.770
<v Speaker 2>of ancient Greece.</v>

76
00:02:43.771 --> 00:02:46.050
<v Speaker 2>That wasn't a big feat.</v>

77
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.750
<v Speaker 2>But the enlightenment of course,</v>

78
00:02:48.751 --> 00:02:49.870
<v Speaker 2>did not spring out of,</v>

79
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:50.670
<v Speaker 2>out of nowhere.</v>

80
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.410
<v Speaker 2>If I were to identify the antecedents,</v>

81
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.170
<v Speaker 2>what and why,</v>

82
00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.290
<v Speaker 2>what happened prior to the 18th century that allowed it to kind of pull down as</v>

83
00:02:59.291 --> 00:03:01.060
<v Speaker 2>opposed to a couple of hundred years earlier,</v>

84
00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:02.290
<v Speaker 2>a couple of hundred years later,</v>

85
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.640
<v Speaker 2>one of them was the scientific revolution conventionally located in the,</v>

86
00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:07.810
<v Speaker 2>in the 17th century,</v>

87
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.130
<v Speaker 2>which not only provided a paradigm for understanding,</v>

88
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.020
<v Speaker 2>namely,</v>

89
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

90
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.980
<v Speaker 2>testing propositions against the empirical world,</v>

91
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.440
<v Speaker 2>seeking deeper,</v>

92
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.710
<v Speaker 2>naturalistic explanations for phenomena.</v>

93
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.540
<v Speaker 2>And which of course overturned a millennia.</v>

94
00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:30.541
<v Speaker 2>Old Dogmas reminding people that bear their own common sense,</v>

95
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:31.750
<v Speaker 2>their own societies,</v>

96
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:32.520
<v Speaker 2>convictions.</v>

97
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.710
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

98
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:33.460
<v Speaker 2>we're fallible.</v>

99
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:34.250
<v Speaker 2>So that was,</v>

100
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

101
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.370
<v Speaker 2>an essential precursor.</v>

102
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.860
<v Speaker 2>Another one was the discovery of the,</v>

103
00:03:38.861 --> 00:03:39.431
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

104
00:03:39.431 --> 00:03:40.450
<v Speaker 2>of the new world.</v>

105
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.670
<v Speaker 2>That there were entire civilizations,</v>

106
00:03:42.671 --> 00:03:44.420
<v Speaker 2>entire world,</v>

107
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.520
<v Speaker 2>literally worlds in their sense that that had been a unknown in that the</v>

108
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.750
<v Speaker 2>knowledge base that they have been part of a Western civilization for Millennia</v>

109
00:03:56.651 --> 00:03:58.030
<v Speaker 2>was radically incomplete.</v>

110
00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.590
<v Speaker 2>And technologically,</v>

111
00:03:59.591 --> 00:04:00.880
<v Speaker 2>I suspect that the,</v>

112
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:01.763
<v Speaker 2>the greater,</v>

113
00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:02.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

114
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.150
<v Speaker 2>exchange of ideas and people,</v>

115
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.871
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

116
00:04:04.871 --> 00:04:09.220
<v Speaker 2>was a contributor there prior to be just prior to be lightened in the second</v>

117
00:04:09.221 --> 00:04:10.390
<v Speaker 2>half of the 18th century.</v>

118
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.510
<v Speaker 2>There's a massive growth in the efficiency of,</v>

119
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

120
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.020
<v Speaker 2>printing printing presses itself.</v>

121
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.920
<v Speaker 2>But it was the democratization of books and pamphlets,</v>

122
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.130
<v Speaker 2>the rise literacy,</v>

123
00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:24.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

124
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.210
<v Speaker 2>and the movement of people.</v>

125
00:04:25.211 --> 00:04:26.890
<v Speaker 2>It became easier for,</v>

126
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:27.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

127
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.520
<v Speaker 2>for heretics and radicals to jump ship and move to where things were cooler if</v>

128
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.940
<v Speaker 2>things got too uncomfortable where they were.</v>

129
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.810
<v Speaker 2>And it's amazing how many of the enlightenment thinkers were persecuted for</v>

130
00:04:40.811 --> 00:04:41.644
<v Speaker 2>their beliefs.</v>

131
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.990
<v Speaker 2>They were threatened with imprisonment or death.</v>

132
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:45.770
<v Speaker 2>Many of them ended up in,</v>

133
00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.570
<v Speaker 2>in Holland or Paris or London or jumped around to wherever they had made the</v>

134
00:04:49.571 --> 00:04:50.404
<v Speaker 2>greatest freedom,</v>

135
00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.060
<v Speaker 2>but also just the sheer,</v>

136
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

137
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.460
<v Speaker 2>I'll kind of precursor of the,</v>

138
00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:54.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

139
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:55.631
<v Speaker 2>the web today.</v>

140
00:04:55.631 --> 00:05:00.040
<v Speaker 2>The fact that pamphlet can be introduced and within a few months it would be</v>

141
00:05:00.041 --> 00:05:01.270
<v Speaker 2>translated into,</v>

142
00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:02.443
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

143
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

144
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.650
<v Speaker 2>a dozen European languages and,</v>

145
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:06.610
<v Speaker 2>and smuggled in.</v>

146
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.791
<v Speaker 2>So the exchange of,</v>

147
00:05:07.791 --> 00:05:08.830
<v Speaker 2>of ideas,</v>

148
00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:09.161
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

149
00:05:09.161 --> 00:05:09.994
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

150
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.391
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

151
00:05:10.391 --> 00:05:12.370
<v Speaker 2>help to accelerate the,</v>

152
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

153
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.863
<v Speaker 2>the enlightenment.</v>

154
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.150
<v Speaker 2>Although since it only happened once in human history,</v>

155
00:05:16.151 --> 00:05:20.680
<v Speaker 2>we can never really know for sure why it happened when it did,</v>

156
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:21.850
<v Speaker 2>but at those are three.</v>

157
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:23.020
<v Speaker 2>Good,</v>

158
00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.310
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

159
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.550
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

160
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.700
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

161
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.861
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

162
00:05:23.861 --> 00:05:28.060
<v Speaker 1>we're in an interesting time now where we can sit and make a video like this and</v>

163
00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:32.380
<v Speaker 1>publish it almost instantaneously and share it with half a million people.</v>

164
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:37.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean that that ability to share ideas rapidly is developing a pace and God</v>

165
00:05:39.101 --> 00:05:40.840
<v Speaker 1>only knows what the consequence of that is.</v>

166
00:05:40.841 --> 00:05:41.111
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>

167
00:05:41.111 --> 00:05:42.310
<v Speaker 1>we're in a situation now,</v>

168
00:05:42.311 --> 00:05:44.320
<v Speaker 1>which was only occurred to me about last year,</v>

169
00:05:44.321 --> 00:05:48.340
<v Speaker 1>where the spoken word for the first time in human history has the same reach and</v>

170
00:05:48.341 --> 00:05:49.870
<v Speaker 1>longevity as the written word.</v>

171
00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.100
<v Speaker 1>And it's easier for people to listen.</v>

172
00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

173
00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.320
<v Speaker 1>audio books are becoming very popular.</v>

174
00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.990
<v Speaker 1>Lots and lots of people listen to podcasts,</v>

175
00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.620
<v Speaker 1>know I have working class people come to my talks all the time and say,</v>

176
00:06:00.621 --> 00:06:00.861
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

177
00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:04.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm sitting in my forklift for three hours a day and I'm doing nothing but</v>

178
00:06:04.581 --> 00:06:05.810
<v Speaker 1>listening to podcasts,</v>

179
00:06:05.811 --> 00:06:06.470
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

180
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:07.303
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

181
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.170
<v Speaker 1>that's a really remarkable thing.</v>

182
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:10.430
<v Speaker 1>So I think,</v>

183
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.080
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm going to let you go.</v>

184
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:13.880
<v Speaker 1>You've been very generous with your time.</v>

185
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.180
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate the conversation very much.</v>

186
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to close by</v>

187
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.660
<v Speaker 1>showing your book again and Steven Pinker's new book enlightenment now,</v>

188
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:28.780
<v Speaker 1>which is tearing up the bestseller charts and which is a guide to proper end</v>

189
00:06:28.971 --> 00:06:31.410
<v Speaker 1>intelligent optimism in the 21st century.</v>

190
00:06:31.411 --> 00:06:33.530
<v Speaker 1>And maybe I'd ask you just in closing,</v>

191
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.860
<v Speaker 1>what do you think there are things that individuals,</v>

192
00:06:36.861 --> 00:06:40.160
<v Speaker 1>what do you think individuals should be particularly optimistic about right now?</v>

193
00:06:40.161 --> 00:06:45.161
<v Speaker 1>And what do you think individuals could do to spread the message that things are</v>

194
00:06:46.341 --> 00:06:48.650
<v Speaker 1>getting better and that we can solve our problems?</v>

195
00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:50.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

196
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:51.103
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

197
00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:56.480
<v Speaker 2>the fact that there are new efforts to try transcend political divisions and</v>

198
00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:02.570
<v Speaker 2>find out what works to depoliticize and rationalize,</v>

199
00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:03.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

200
00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.220
<v Speaker 2>problems like poverty,</v>

201
00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:06.450
<v Speaker 2>like climate change,</v>

202
00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:07.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

203
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.650
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

204
00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:09.690
<v Speaker 2>like war and peace like crime.</v>

205
00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:10.923
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

206
00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:15.540
<v Speaker 2>those are very much worth supporting that there are organizations like at a</v>

207
00:07:15.541 --> 00:07:16.374
<v Speaker 2>political,</v>

208
00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:21.590
<v Speaker 2>there are NGOs that tried to monitor the state of the world.</v>

209
00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:27.450
<v Speaker 2>There's effective altruism that just the general application of rationality to</v>

210
00:07:27.451 --> 00:07:31.140
<v Speaker 2>solve our problems that is responsible for the progress that we've enjoyed in</v>

211
00:07:31.141 --> 00:07:31.711
<v Speaker 2>the past.</v>

212
00:07:31.711 --> 00:07:35.010
<v Speaker 2>And if there's going to be progress ahead of us will be responsible for what</v>

213
00:07:35.011 --> 00:07:36.000
<v Speaker 2>will enjoy in the future.</v>

214
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:38.370
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

215
00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:38.860
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

216
00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:39.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

217
00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:39.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

218
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:40.673
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

219
00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:45.920
<v Speaker 1>would like to close to by mentioning to everyone who's listening that you know,</v>

220
00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:47.280
<v Speaker 1>things aren't getting better.</v>

221
00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:51.180
<v Speaker 1>They're getting better because people are facing problems and actually trying to</v>

222
00:07:51.181 --> 00:07:51.691
<v Speaker 1>solve them.</v>

223
00:07:51.691 --> 00:07:54.120
<v Speaker 1>They're doing micro analysis of the problems,</v>

224
00:07:54.121 --> 00:07:56.250
<v Speaker 1>breaking them down into their constituent elements,</v>

225
00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:00.150
<v Speaker 1>being humble enough to use incremental solutions to solve them.</v>

226
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.340
<v Speaker 1>And to address them at,</v>

227
00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.400
<v Speaker 1>at at a high level of resolution instead of a low level of,</v>

228
00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.260
<v Speaker 1>or a low resolution level of ideological debate.</v>

229
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:09.490
<v Speaker 1>And it's really working.</v>

230
00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:10.863
<v Speaker 1>And I would,</v>

231
00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:11.853
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

232
00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:16.980
<v Speaker 1>what would we say encourage people to pick up Dr Pinker's book because the world</v>

233
00:08:17.231 --> 00:08:19.960
<v Speaker 1>is getting better and we should know it and we should be happy about it.</v>

234
00:08:19.961 --> 00:08:23.680
<v Speaker 1>And we should continue to foster that development in every way that we can.</v>

235
00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.780
<v Speaker 1>And I think this is an excellent,</v>

236
00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:29.590
<v Speaker 1>this book is an excellent contribution to that effort as well as your other</v>

237
00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:30.783
<v Speaker 1>books like are,</v>

238
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:32.430
<v Speaker 1>are better rangers,</v>

239
00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:33.453
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>

240
00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:35.170
<v Speaker 1>better angels of our nature.</v>

241
00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:40.120
<v Speaker 1>So thank you very much for spending the time with me today and for talking with</v>

242
00:08:40.121 --> 00:08:41.560
<v Speaker 1>me and it was a pleasure to meet you.</v>

243
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:43.151
<v Speaker 2>Thanks so much.</v>

244
00:08:43.151 --> 00:08:44.130
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for having a Jordan.</v>

245
00:08:44.131 --> 00:08:45.220
<v Speaker 2>Who's the pleasure was mine.</v>
