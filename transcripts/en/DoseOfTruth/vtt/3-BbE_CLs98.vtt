00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.370
<v Speaker 1>Hi Dr Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks for coming.</v>

2
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.010
<v Speaker 1>My question is a little bit off topic</v>
<v Speaker 1>from everything else tonight,</v>

3
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.940
<v Speaker 1>but I really wanted to hear what you had</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say about it.</v>

4
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I work in residence life here at UBC and</v>

5
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.920
<v Speaker 1>in the community where I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were recently effected by a suicide</v>

6
00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:29.640
<v Speaker 1>of someone who lived in our community</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was upset about it,</v>

7
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.220
<v Speaker 1>not just because obviously it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible thing to have happen,</v>

8
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.760
<v Speaker 1>but also because res life in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>university,</v>

9
00:00:35.761 --> 00:00:40.200
<v Speaker 1>like they talk all this talk about like</v>
<v Speaker 1>self care and your mental health is so</v>

10
00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:42.780
<v Speaker 1>important to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then things like this still</v>

11
00:00:42.781 --> 00:00:45.570
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I wanted to know like if you think</v>

12
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.090
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think the university should</v>

13
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.910
<v Speaker 1>be doing to keep stuff like this from</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening in the future?</v>

14
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:55.503
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

15
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.400
<v Speaker 1>it's not self evident that it's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>university's responsibility and the</v>

16
00:01:03.951 --> 00:01:06.200
<v Speaker 1>reason for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it isn't.</v>

17
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.870
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying it's not self evident that it</v>

18
00:01:08.871 --> 00:01:13.280
<v Speaker 1>is because different institutions can</v>
<v Speaker 1>only do so many things,</v>

19
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.890
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

20
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.890
<v Speaker 1>and we were already requiring the</v>
<v Speaker 1>universities to educate and to act as</v>

21
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.530
<v Speaker 1>substitute parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Increasingly.</v>

22
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.770
<v Speaker 1>And to take on the role of judge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jury and executioner as there are more,</v>

23
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.340
<v Speaker 1>what should be criminal cases are being</v>
<v Speaker 1>handled within the university.</v>

24
00:01:34.341 --> 00:01:35.174
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>

25
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:36.583
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

26
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.790
<v Speaker 1>having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could ask the broader question is,</v>

27
00:01:42.791 --> 00:01:46.600
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you do to help people be</v>

28
00:01:46.601 --> 00:01:50.920
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently in love with life so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't wish to end it now?</v>

29
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.060
<v Speaker 1>And I've tried to puzzle through that</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a long time and that's partly why</v>

30
00:01:55.061 --> 00:01:56.590
<v Speaker 1>I've written the things that I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>written.</v>

31
00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.980
<v Speaker 1>It's partly why I've produced the online</v>
<v Speaker 1>programs that I've produced.</v>

32
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.360
<v Speaker 1>No one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we know that if you do,</v>

33
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.490
<v Speaker 1>if you have students do the future</v>
<v Speaker 1>authoring program,</v>

34
00:02:06.491 --> 00:02:08.590
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're much less likely to drop out of</v>

35
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.530
<v Speaker 1>university about 30 percent less likely</v>
<v Speaker 1>and their grades go up.</v>

36
00:02:11.531 --> 00:02:16.000
<v Speaker 1>And that's especially true if they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>male and marginalized.</v>

37
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.340
<v Speaker 1>It has a bigger impact on those</v>
<v Speaker 1>communities.</v>

38
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:19.720
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

39
00:02:19.721 --> 00:02:22.270
<v Speaker 1>I've tried to get universities interests</v>
<v Speaker 1>now the data's there,</v>

40
00:02:22.271 --> 00:02:24.940
<v Speaker 1>but they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's very difficult to get a big</v>

41
00:02:24.941 --> 00:02:25.930
<v Speaker 1>bureaucracy to move.</v>

42
00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.650
<v Speaker 1>A big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big is immobile.</v>

43
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.210
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not sure there's anything they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can really do about it.</v>

44
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.450
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly possible that the things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're trying to do about it or</v>

45
00:02:37.451 --> 00:02:38.860
<v Speaker 1>making it worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

46
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.620
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing that you learn if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a good social scientists,</v>

47
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.770
<v Speaker 1>just like there was evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know if this is still the</v>

48
00:02:44.771 --> 00:02:45.350
<v Speaker 1>case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

49
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.000
<v Speaker 1>but there was good evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I looked into this about 15 years ago.</v>

50
00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.100
<v Speaker 1>Say you want to prevent suicides or</v>
<v Speaker 1>suicide hotline in your town and you</v>

51
00:02:54.101 --> 00:02:55.630
<v Speaker 1>advertise it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens?</v>

52
00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.200
<v Speaker 1>Suicide rate goes up because you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>advertising suicide,</v>

53
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.620
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And lots of lots of interventions are</v>

54
00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:03.790
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>

55
00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:06.850
<v Speaker 1>really hard to make things better and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>

56
00:03:06.851 --> 00:03:10.180
<v Speaker 1>really easy to make them worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's another problem.</v>

57
00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:12.580
<v Speaker 1>You get these big bureaucracies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

58
00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:15.940
<v Speaker 1>and there hypothetically motivated by</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive intentions and I would say</v>

59
00:03:15.941 --> 00:03:16.960
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

60
00:03:16.961 --> 00:03:20.170
<v Speaker 1>because it takes an awful lot of work to</v>
<v Speaker 1>help someone straightened out.</v>

61
00:03:20.171 --> 00:03:22.900
<v Speaker 1>It's no joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're in real trouble</v>

62
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.380
<v Speaker 1>and they put in place these</v>
<v Speaker 1>structures that are designed to help but</v>

63
00:03:29.041 --> 00:03:32.850
<v Speaker 1>they don't ever evaluate them and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>could easily be making it worse.</v>

64
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:34.583
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

65
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.490
<v Speaker 1>So I don't have a straightforward answer</v>
<v Speaker 1>to that question.</v>

66
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.430
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that.</v>

67
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

68
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.270
<v Speaker 1>that's the only answer I have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
