1
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.240
<v Speaker 1>Well one of the things I really can't figure out,</v>

3
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.850
<v Speaker 1>maybe you could shed some light on this too,</v>

4
00:00:10.851 --> 00:00:11.940
<v Speaker 1>is you know,</v>

5
00:00:11.941 --> 00:00:16.941
<v Speaker 1>of all the things that women's political movements should be doing in the West</v>

6
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.390
<v Speaker 1>is demanding.</v>

7
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.150
<v Speaker 1>As far as I can tell that the western countries,</v>

8
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.070
<v Speaker 1>let's say led by their male rulers,</v>

9
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.720
<v Speaker 1>stop treating the Saudis like are there are allies and I cannot understand why</v>

10
00:00:27.721 --> 00:00:32.721
<v Speaker 1>there hasn't been concerted pressure put on Western governments by women who are</v>

11
00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:33.781
<v Speaker 1>concerned,</v>

12
00:00:33.781 --> 00:00:37.680
<v Speaker 1>at least in principle with the equality and freedom of women around the world to</v>

13
00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:40.320
<v Speaker 1>stop treating the Saudis like they're our allies.</v>

14
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.580
<v Speaker 1>And so that and that,</v>

15
00:00:41.581 --> 00:00:43.520
<v Speaker 1>that's another thing that perplexes me entirely.</v>

16
00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:48.270
<v Speaker 1>And though cynical part of me thinks that the feminists who are more or less</v>

17
00:00:48.271 --> 00:00:52.410
<v Speaker 1>hell bent on the destruction of the western Patriarchy adopt the attitude that</v>

18
00:00:52.411 --> 00:00:54.390
<v Speaker 1>the enemy of my enemy is my friend.</v>

19
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.520
<v Speaker 1>And so they're willing to put up with what the Saudis to do.</v>

20
00:00:56.521 --> 00:00:58.980
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think that's a sufficient explanation.</v>

21
00:00:58.981 --> 00:00:59.814
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

22
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:01.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can view our,</v>

23
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:02.483
<v Speaker 1>our culture,</v>

24
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.200
<v Speaker 1>so to speak a little bit from,</v>

25
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.530
<v Speaker 1>from the outside position because you have moved in as an immigrant and that</v>

26
00:01:07.531 --> 00:01:11.130
<v Speaker 1>gives you a viewpoint that it's much more difficult for someone within it to</v>

27
00:01:11.131 --> 00:01:11.581
<v Speaker 1>share.</v>

28
00:01:11.581 --> 00:01:13.860
<v Speaker 1>And so like what do you see as,</v>

29
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.160
<v Speaker 1>as driving the absence of pressure,</v>

30
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.370
<v Speaker 1>let's say from women on governments in relationship to these?</v>

31
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.830
<v Speaker 1>I would say reprehensible dictatorships.</v>

32
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.903
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>

33
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:25.650
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

34
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean she's cool.</v>

35
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.980
<v Speaker 1>I'll be occupied with Western country after with the [inaudible].</v>

36
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.200
<v Speaker 1>What I see is that they have,</v>

37
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.041
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

38
00:01:34.041 --> 00:01:35.220
<v Speaker 1>that's all that they're focused on.</v>

39
00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.070
<v Speaker 1>They do not talk about,</v>

40
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.110
<v Speaker 1>discuss Craig,</v>

41
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:43.120
<v Speaker 1>she's the issue or a men of color and the Patriarchy of man of color or</v>

42
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.570
<v Speaker 1>immigrants or the nations and countries.</v>

43
00:01:47.571 --> 00:01:49.690
<v Speaker 1>Men in nations and countries outside.</v>

44
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:50.120
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

45
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.953
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

46
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.350
<v Speaker 2>the wench number feminists have also written to the identity politics there for</v>

47
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.200
<v Speaker 2>to come to multiculturalism and all these things are bad for women,</v>

48
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.890
<v Speaker 2>bad turn Western women and bad.</v>

49
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
<v Speaker 2>So if you believe multiculturalism courses that before and that one person,</v>

50
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.020
<v Speaker 2>that's one project,</v>

51
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.930
<v Speaker 2>the wife had nothing to say about the culture of Islam</v>

52
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.700
<v Speaker 2>since it's all sort of equal,</v>

53
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.040
<v Speaker 2>then they feel that they count,</v>

54
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.053
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

55
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.953
<v Speaker 2>pressure</v>

56
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.183
<v Speaker 2>to address</v>

57
00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.930
<v Speaker 1>list that black women and Muslim women and women of color,</v>

58
00:02:43.231 --> 00:02:45.090
<v Speaker 1>if they wanted to get out of oppression,</v>

59
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.010
<v Speaker 1>then they should organize themselves.</v>

60
00:02:47.011 --> 00:02:47.880
<v Speaker 1>That's what they believe.</v>

61
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.560
<v Speaker 1>What I find ironic draw is that sometimes when we do organize ourselves,</v>

62
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.830
<v Speaker 1>I am organized with all the extra Muslim woman to talk about the misogyny that's</v>

63
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.470
<v Speaker 1>subjected to women in the name.</v>

64
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.350
<v Speaker 1>I get it from white linens,</v>

65
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:04.663
<v Speaker 1>white feminist,</v>

66
00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:05.503
<v Speaker 1>atheist,</v>

67
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.100
<v Speaker 1>biggest puzzle ever.</v>

68
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.370
<v Speaker 1>The treatment that you've received at the hand of Western feminists.</v>

69
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.731
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>

70
00:03:12.731 --> 00:03:13.060
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

71
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.060
<v Speaker 1>that's something that's just absolutely leaves me absolutely speechless because</v>

72
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.470
<v Speaker 1>not only me,</v>

73
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.250
<v Speaker 1>it's all of us who are hiring.</v>

74
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.650
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

75
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:22.020
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

76
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.780
<v Speaker 1>like I thought only two ex Muslims,</v>

77
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.840
<v Speaker 1>but there are black women who are fighting for their rights and they all get</v>

78
00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:29.740
<v Speaker 1>shut down.</v>
