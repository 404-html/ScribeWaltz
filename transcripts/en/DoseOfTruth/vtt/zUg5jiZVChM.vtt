1
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:08.453
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.200
<v Speaker 1>So that's the coat of many colors.</v>

3
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.270
<v Speaker 1>So it's an estimation of what Joseph is like and what we're seeing with all of</v>

4
00:00:15.271 --> 00:00:20.271
<v Speaker 1>these patriarchal figures is the continual realization of the ideal person,</v>

5
00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:21.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

6
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.650
<v Speaker 1>You could think about it as success of approximations of the ideal person.</v>

7
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.520
<v Speaker 1>And the story is exploring all sorts of different possibilities,</v>

8
00:00:29.521 --> 00:00:33.180
<v Speaker 1>including ones that are very violent and catastrophic and malevolent.</v>

9
00:00:33.181 --> 00:00:33.380
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

10
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.660
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

11
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.660
<v Speaker 1>it's trying to cover the entire territory and to focus in on what's the proper</v>

12
00:00:39.431 --> 00:00:40.660
<v Speaker 1>way through the maze,</v>

13
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:41.620
<v Speaker 1>the maze of life,</v>

14
00:00:41.621 --> 00:00:42.454
<v Speaker 1>the labyrinth.</v>

15
00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.630
<v Speaker 1>And the hint here is that while you should be multidimensional,</v>

16
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.300
<v Speaker 1>these are the generations of Jacob.</v>

17
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.190
<v Speaker 1>Joseph being 17 years old was feeding the flock with his brother and allowed,</v>

18
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.480
<v Speaker 1>was with the sons of Bilhah and with the sons of Zilpah,</v>

19
00:00:55.481 --> 00:00:56.380
<v Speaker 1>his father's wives.</v>

20
00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.520
<v Speaker 1>And Joseph brought unto his father they're evil report.</v>

21
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.983
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

22
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.040
<v Speaker 1>we already know that Joseph has Jacob's favorite and so that doesn't make him</v>

23
00:01:06.041 --> 00:01:08.620
<v Speaker 1>very popular among his brothers.</v>

24
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:09.670
<v Speaker 1>He's younger.</v>

25
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.420
<v Speaker 1>And now we also find out that he's being set up more or less,</v>

26
00:01:13.421 --> 00:01:15.160
<v Speaker 1>as you might say,</v>

27
00:01:15.161 --> 00:01:15.994
<v Speaker 1>a snitch,</v>

28
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.360
<v Speaker 1>because that's what this phrase means is that he goes out and watch us,</v>

29
00:01:19.361 --> 00:01:20.021
<v Speaker 1>his older brothers.</v>

30
00:01:20.021 --> 00:01:21.940
<v Speaker 1>And if they do something they shouldn't do that.</v>

31
00:01:21.941 --> 00:01:25.420
<v Speaker 1>He comes trotting back to Jacob and reports,</v>

32
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.370
<v Speaker 1>well that's not going to make you popular.</v>

33
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:28.630
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

34
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:29.261
<v Speaker 1>and you would say,</v>

35
00:01:29.261 --> 00:01:29.411
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

36
00:01:29.411 --> 00:01:30.760
<v Speaker 1>is that Joseph's problem</v>

37
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.310
<v Speaker 1>or Jacob's problem.</v>

38
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.721
<v Speaker 1>And I would say,</v>

39
00:01:35.721 --> 00:01:37.640
<v Speaker 1>and this is something I learned from reading dealing too,</v>

40
00:01:37.641 --> 00:01:39.830
<v Speaker 1>is that that's a conspiratorial problem,</v>

41
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

42
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.660
<v Speaker 1>Is it's the parents at fault,</v>

43
00:01:42.661 --> 00:01:45.900
<v Speaker 1>but so is the child who agrees to do that.</v>

44
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.250
<v Speaker 1>They've got a little cabal going and you might say,</v>

45
00:01:51.251 --> 00:01:51.401
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

46
00:01:51.401 --> 00:01:52.570
<v Speaker 1>it's only the parents' fault,</v>

47
00:01:52.571 --> 00:01:57.571
<v Speaker 1>but the sun will be taking advantage of every advantage that offers him.</v>

48
00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:59.820
<v Speaker 1>Because he could say no to.</v>

49
00:01:59.821 --> 00:02:00.660
<v Speaker 1>I won't do that.</v>

50
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.781
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

51
00:02:01.781 --> 00:02:04.950
<v Speaker 1>so Joseph is the favorite.</v>

52
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.230
<v Speaker 1>He's a bit of a teacher's pet.</v>

53
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.310
<v Speaker 1>That's what it looks like.</v>

54
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.841
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

55
00:02:09.841 --> 00:02:12.900
<v Speaker 1>Israel loved Joseph more than all his colors because he was the son of his old</v>

56
00:02:12.901 --> 00:02:14.730
<v Speaker 1>age and he made him a coat of many colors.</v>

57
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.630
<v Speaker 1>And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his</v>

58
00:02:18.631 --> 00:02:19.020
<v Speaker 1>brothers,</v>

59
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.240
<v Speaker 1>they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto him.</v>

60
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.560
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you have a child or number of children and one of them is your</v>

61
00:02:25.561 --> 00:02:25.951
<v Speaker 1>favorite.</v>

62
00:02:25.951 --> 00:02:27.510
<v Speaker 1>How should you treat that child?</v>

63
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

64
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.850
<v Speaker 1>it isn't obvious that you do them any favors by overtly making them be your</v>

65
00:02:32.851 --> 00:02:33.684
<v Speaker 1>favorite,</v>

66
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.471
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

67
00:02:34.471 --> 00:02:34.681
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

68
00:02:34.681 --> 00:02:35.514
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

69
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.620
<v Speaker 1>maybe you don't challenge them as much as you should.</v>

70
00:02:37.621 --> 00:02:38.460
<v Speaker 1>And second of all,</v>

71
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.620
<v Speaker 1>you definitely set up a cane,</v>

72
00:02:40.621 --> 00:02:43.800
<v Speaker 1>enable like scenario in the household and that,</v>

73
00:02:43.801 --> 00:02:47.040
<v Speaker 1>or maybe it's an edible situation too because you happen to love your child more</v>

74
00:02:47.041 --> 00:02:47.874
<v Speaker 1>than you love your,</v>

75
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.930
<v Speaker 1>your spouse,</v>

76
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.800
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

77
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.320
<v Speaker 1>that's not a recipe for familial harmony.</v>

78
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.660
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

79
00:02:54.661 --> 00:02:56.220
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be a bad idea.</v>

80
00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.551
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

81
00:02:56.551 --> 00:03:01.270
<v Speaker 1>So now we have two reasons that Joseph is not liked by his brothers is,</v>

82
00:03:01.271 --> 00:03:02.104
<v Speaker 1>one is,</v>

83
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.310
<v Speaker 1>well he's a bit of a rat Fink and the other is that he's the,</v>

84
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.970
<v Speaker 1>he's the favorite and he's playing that to the hilt by the looks of things.</v>

85
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.300
<v Speaker 1>And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren</v>

86
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.681
<v Speaker 1>and all his brothers,</v>

87
00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:17.800
<v Speaker 1>and they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto him,</v>

88
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:19.803
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

89
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.650
<v Speaker 1>And Joseph dreamed a dream and he told it to his brethren and they hated him.</v>

90
00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:24.430
<v Speaker 1>The more.</v>
