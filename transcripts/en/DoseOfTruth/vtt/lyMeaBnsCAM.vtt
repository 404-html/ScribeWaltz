1
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:08.551
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2
00:00:08.551 --> 00:00:09.384
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

3
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.310
<v Speaker 1>now there's an idea that's,</v>

4
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.410
<v Speaker 1>that's reflected in the Jacob's ladder story,</v>

5
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.950
<v Speaker 1>that the center where you put the pillar is also the place where heaven and</v>

6
00:00:25.501 --> 00:00:26.430
<v Speaker 1>earth touch.</v>

7
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.073
<v Speaker 1>And so that's,</v>

8
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.140
<v Speaker 1>that's a complicated idea I think that you can,</v>

9
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to look at these stories from a psychological perspective.</v>

11
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.720
<v Speaker 1>And so then you could say that that's a symbolic place where the lowest and the</v>

12
00:00:39.721 --> 00:00:41.280
<v Speaker 1>highest come together.</v>

13
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.970
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a place where earthly being stretches up to the highest possible</v>

14
00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:49.830
<v Speaker 1>ethical abstraction.</v>

15
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.340
<v Speaker 1>And that's the center because one of the things that defines us say,</v>

16
00:00:55.711 --> 00:00:56.730
<v Speaker 1>as opposed to them,</v>

17
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.780
<v Speaker 1>is that we're all United within a certain ethic.</v>

18
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.210
<v Speaker 1>That's what makes us the same.</v>

19
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.230
<v Speaker 1>This is a complicated line of reasoning,</v>

20
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:07.523
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

21
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.420
<v Speaker 1>I'll go back to it after I show you some more pictures.</v>

22
00:01:12.421 --> 00:01:12.601
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

23
00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:13.051
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>

24
00:01:13.051 --> 00:01:17.820
<v Speaker 1>that's the first idea is that the center is the place where the lowest and the</v>

25
00:01:17.821 --> 00:01:19.650
<v Speaker 1>highest touch simultaneously.</v>

26
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.000
<v Speaker 1>And so you could say that in some sense it specifies the aim of a group of</v>

27
00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:24.630
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

28
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.463
<v Speaker 1>That's another way.</v>

29
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.220
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

30
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.590
<v Speaker 1>if you get together with people to make a group,</v>

31
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.851
<v Speaker 1>even at work,</v>

32
00:01:29.851 --> 00:01:34.200
<v Speaker 1>you group yourself around a project and that unites you and it unites you</v>

33
00:01:34.201 --> 00:01:35.490
<v Speaker 1>because you all have the same aim.</v>

34
00:01:35.491 --> 00:01:37.380
<v Speaker 1>You're all pointing to the same thing.</v>

35
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.570
<v Speaker 1>And that makes you the same in some ways.</v>

36
00:01:39.571 --> 00:01:42.120
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're after the same thing I am,</v>

37
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.360
<v Speaker 1>then the same things are going to be important to you that are important to me.</v>

38
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.301
<v Speaker 1>And the same things,</v>

39
00:01:46.301 --> 00:01:49.050
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be negative to you that are negative to me because our emotions</v>

40
00:01:49.051 --> 00:01:49.890
<v Speaker 1>work out that way.</v>

41
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.140
<v Speaker 1>And that means I can instantly predict you,</v>

42
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.000
<v Speaker 1>I know how you're going to behave.</v>

43
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.290
<v Speaker 1>And so our aim,</v>

44
00:01:55.291 --> 00:01:57.000
<v Speaker 1>which is basically our ethical aim,</v>

45
00:01:57.001 --> 00:01:58.860
<v Speaker 1>it's because we're aiming at something better.</v>

46
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.930
<v Speaker 1>At least in principle,</v>

47
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.400
<v Speaker 1>we're aiming at something better.</v>

48
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.950
<v Speaker 1>It's our ethical aim that unites our perceptions.</v>

49
00:02:04.951 --> 00:02:06.780
<v Speaker 1>And that's what aligns or emotions.</v>

50
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.760
<v Speaker 1>And so that sort of begs the question,</v>

51
00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:13.140
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to build a community around what aim should the community</v>

52
00:02:13.141 --> 00:02:14.010
<v Speaker 1>congregate?</v>

53
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.941
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

54
00:02:14.941 --> 00:02:16.830
<v Speaker 1>So the idea here is that the coe,</v>

55
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.710
<v Speaker 1>the center of the community is the pillar that Unites Heaven and earth.</v>

56
00:02:19.711 --> 00:02:21.450
<v Speaker 1>So it unites the lowest with the highest.</v>

57
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.690
<v Speaker 1>So there's some intimation of the idea that it's the highest that unites the</v>

58
00:02:26.731 --> 00:02:27.564
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

59
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.501
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

60
00:02:28.501 --> 00:02:30.150
<v Speaker 1>And so keep that in mind.</v>

61
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.000
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very old idea as well.</v>

62
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.010
<v Speaker 1>That's the idea of the access Monday,</v>

63
00:02:35.011 --> 00:02:37.710
<v Speaker 1>which is the center pole that unites having an earth.</v>

64
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.420
<v Speaker 1>It's an unbelievably old idea.</v>

65
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.310
<v Speaker 1>Tens of thousands of years old.</v>

66
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.720
<v Speaker 1>It might even stretch back to whatever our archaic memories,</v>

67
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.520
<v Speaker 1>Quasi Memories,</v>

68
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.090
<v Speaker 1>I dunno how what you would describe them archetipal memories of are excessively</v>

69
00:02:53.401 --> 00:02:54.930
<v Speaker 1>old ancestry and trees.</v>

70
00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.930
<v Speaker 1>When the tree itself was in fact the center of the world and that it was ringed</v>

71
00:03:00.041 --> 00:03:01.540
<v Speaker 1>by snakes and chaos.</v>

72
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.440
<v Speaker 1>And so while we have no idea how old these ideas are,</v>

73
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:06.221
<v Speaker 1>but they're very,</v>

74
00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:09.790
<v Speaker 1>very old and evolution is a conservative business.</v>

75
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.710
<v Speaker 1>Once it builds a gadget,</v>

76
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.510
<v Speaker 1>then it builds new things on top of that gadgets like a medieval town.</v>

77
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.540
<v Speaker 1>The center of the town is really old and new,</v>

78
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.870
<v Speaker 1>newer areas of the town get built around it.</v>

79
00:03:22.871 --> 00:03:24.530
<v Speaker 1>But the center is still really old.</v>

80
00:03:24.531 --> 00:03:26.050
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we're like,</v>

81
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.913
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

82
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.370
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

83
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.760
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

84
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.900
<v Speaker 1>our platforms like our,</v>

85
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.630
<v Speaker 1>our basic physiological structure,</v>

86
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:32.040
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

87
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.040
<v Speaker 1>this skeletal body is some tens of millions of years old or older than that.</v>

88
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:39.730
<v Speaker 1>If you think about vertebrates,</v>

89
00:03:39.731 --> 00:03:40.810
<v Speaker 1>it's much older than that.</v>

90
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.280
<v Speaker 1>And that's all conserved.</v>

91
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.930
<v Speaker 1>So everything's built on top of everything else.</v>

92
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.531
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

93
00:03:47.531 --> 00:03:48.070
<v Speaker 1>so there,</v>

94
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.480
<v Speaker 1>there's a kind of a classic town and there's the idea,</v>

95
00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:53.141
<v Speaker 1>I showed you this,</v>

96
00:03:53.141 --> 00:03:54.760
<v Speaker 1>this Scandinavian world tree,</v>

97
00:03:54.761 --> 00:03:58.600
<v Speaker 1>same idea at Unites Heaven and earth and around the roots of that tree are</v>

98
00:03:58.601 --> 00:04:00.970
<v Speaker 1>snakes that eat this tree constantly.</v>

99
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.940
<v Speaker 1>So that's the idea that there's stability,</v>

100
00:04:03.941 --> 00:04:07.360
<v Speaker 1>but there's constant transformation around that stability.</v>

101
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.310
<v Speaker 1>And at the same time,</v>

102
00:04:09.311 --> 00:04:12.910
<v Speaker 1>the snakes are knowing in the roots there's streams that are nourishing it.</v>

103
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:14.110
<v Speaker 1>So it's sort of,</v>

104
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.460
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of an echo of the idea that life depends on death and renewal</v>

105
00:04:18.461 --> 00:04:22.840
<v Speaker 1>constantly because your cells are dying and being renewed constantly.</v>

106
00:04:22.841 --> 00:04:23.290
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

107
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.180
<v Speaker 1>If they are just proliferating,</v>

108
00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:26.140
<v Speaker 1>then you have cancer.</v>

109
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.280
<v Speaker 1>If they're just dying,</v>

110
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.650
<v Speaker 1>then you dye it.</v>

111
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.940
<v Speaker 1>You have to get the balance between death and life.</v>

112
00:04:30.941 --> 00:04:31.810
<v Speaker 1>Exactly right.</v>

113
00:04:31.811 --> 00:04:33.190
<v Speaker 1>So that you can actually live,</v>

114
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.080
<v Speaker 1>which is also a very strange thing.</v>

115
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:36.550
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

116
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.930
<v Speaker 1>and that tree is something that reaches from the bottom layers of being maybe</v>

117
00:04:40.931 --> 00:04:43.120
<v Speaker 1>the microcosm all the way to the macrocosm.</v>

118
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:44.231
<v Speaker 1>That's the idea.</v>

119
00:04:44.231 --> 00:04:45.064
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

120
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.080
<v Speaker 1>so then there's,</v>

121
00:04:47.081 --> 00:04:47.321
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

122
00:04:47.321 --> 00:04:48.154
<v Speaker 1>so there's,</v>

123
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.570
<v Speaker 1>there's uh,</v>

124
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.360
<v Speaker 1>Jacob and his and his pillar.</v>

125
00:04:52.361 --> 00:04:55.480
<v Speaker 1>He's got this idea that you can mark the center with this stone.</v>

126
00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.240
<v Speaker 1>Like it's sort of symbolizes what he was laying on when he dreamt,</v>

127
00:04:58.241 --> 00:04:59.260
<v Speaker 1>but now he's got this idea,</v>

128
00:04:59.261 --> 00:05:04.261
<v Speaker 1>you put something erect and it marks the center and it symbolizes his vision of</v>

129
00:05:05.081 --> 00:05:06.100
<v Speaker 1>the highest good,</v>

130
00:05:06.101 --> 00:05:09.520
<v Speaker 1>something like that and the promise that's being made to him.</v>

131
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.610
<v Speaker 1>And then this is an Egyptian obelisk,</v>

132
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.410
<v Speaker 1>the pyramid on top of it.</v>

133
00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:15.460
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

134
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.330
<v Speaker 1>that's in Paris.</v>

135
00:05:16.331 --> 00:05:18.610
<v Speaker 1>It was taken from Luxor and it put in Paris.</v>

136
00:05:18.611 --> 00:05:22.870
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a much more sophisticated</v>

137
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.770
<v Speaker 1>instance of the same idea.</v>

138
00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.551
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

139
00:05:27.551 --> 00:05:32.170
<v Speaker 1>And there was a stone age cultures across Eurasia that put up these huge</v>

140
00:05:32.171 --> 00:05:33.340
<v Speaker 1>obelisks everywhere.</v>

141
00:05:33.341 --> 00:05:33.911
<v Speaker 1>These huge,</v>

142
00:05:33.911 --> 00:05:35.890
<v Speaker 1>like the Stonehenge is a good example of that.</v>

143
00:05:35.891 --> 00:05:36.480
<v Speaker 1>Although it's,</v>

144
