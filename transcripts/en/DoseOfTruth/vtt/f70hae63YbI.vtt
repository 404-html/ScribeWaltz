<v Speaker 1>Can we take the biblical,</v>

2
00:00:08.571 --> 00:00:09.950
<v Speaker 1>Andrew Wells asks,</v>

3
00:00:09.951 --> 00:00:13.970
<v Speaker 1>can we take the biblical story seriously enough with those without also keeping</v>

4
00:00:13.971 --> 00:00:15.200
<v Speaker 1>biblical traditions?</v>

5
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.250
<v Speaker 1>What's the psychological impact of group gathering church going?</v>

6
00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.260
<v Speaker 1>I think we could take the biblical stories seriously enough,</v>

7
00:00:26.261 --> 00:00:29.380
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that it's particularly easy.</v>

8
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:30.813
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

9
00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.160
<v Speaker 1>the traditions bind the community together.</v>

10
00:00:33.161 --> 00:00:35.470
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm saying that and I don't go to church,</v>

11
00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:36.131
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:00:36.131 --> 00:00:39.940
<v Speaker 1>and the reason I don't go to church is because while it drives me crazy to</v>

13
00:00:39.941 --> 00:00:40.241
<v Speaker 1>speak,</v>

14
00:00:40.241 --> 00:00:40.900
<v Speaker 1>frankly,</v>

15
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.400
<v Speaker 1>I haven't been able to sit in a situation like that ever since I was,</v>

16
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:46.200
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

17
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.033
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

18
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.910
<v Speaker 1>That's really the truth of it ever.</v>

19
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.183
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

20
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm not convinced that that's a good thing because I do believe and I've had</v>

21
00:00:54.791 --> 00:00:57.560
<v Speaker 1>good conversations about this with Jonathan Patio,</v>

22
00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.580
<v Speaker 1>I do believe that communal return to the source of the community's ethics is</v>

23
00:01:03.911 --> 00:01:05.470
<v Speaker 1>actually a necessary thing.</v>

24
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.540
<v Speaker 1>And maybe I'm atoning for my past sins by doing these biblical lectures at the</v>

25
00:01:10.541 --> 00:01:10.841
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>

26
00:01:10.841 --> 00:01:12.160
<v Speaker 1>which is something that's communal.</v>

27
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.353
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

28
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.980
<v Speaker 1>and then because there's also something about going where a bunch of other</v>

29
00:01:17.981 --> 00:01:21.400
<v Speaker 1>people are to reaffirm your commitment to,</v>

30
00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.980
<v Speaker 1>to the good that you're all aiming at,</v>

31
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.800
<v Speaker 1>that's got some power in it.</v>

32
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.530
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

33
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.590
<v Speaker 1>and I don't think that that's something that we should forgo.</v>

34
00:01:29.591 --> 00:01:30.520
<v Speaker 1>I think it's dangerous.</v>

35
00:01:30.521 --> 00:01:30.731
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

36
00:01:30.731 --> 00:01:31.564
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

37
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.990
<v Speaker 1>even if you're cynical about church and I guess I would put myself in that</v>

38
00:01:34.991 --> 00:01:35.824
<v Speaker 1>category,</v>

39
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.460
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly the case that communal church going in the 19 fifties say,</v>

40
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.970
<v Speaker 1>provided the average person with at least an hour a week where they were</v>

41
00:01:45.971 --> 00:01:50.971
<v Speaker 1>contemplating no matter how poorly the purpose of ethics in life and,</v>

42
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.890
<v Speaker 1>and the idea of a higher purpose and higher meaning in life.</v>

43
00:01:56.891 --> 00:02:00.460
<v Speaker 1>And you got to think that spending an hour a week thinking about that is better</v>

44
00:02:00.461 --> 00:02:01.870
<v Speaker 1>than never doing it at all.</v>

45
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.330
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know how to,</v>

46
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.450
<v Speaker 1>that tradition can be revivified in a meaningful way,</v>

47
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.440
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's.</v>

48
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.770
<v Speaker 1>I really do think it's a catastrophe that we've lost it because we don't have a</v>

49
00:02:11.771 --> 00:02:12.604
<v Speaker 1>center,</v>

50
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.750
<v Speaker 1>an ethical center that holds our community together.</v>

51
00:02:15.751 --> 00:02:18.850
<v Speaker 1>And the consequence of that is that we're fragmenting quite badly.</v>

52
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.630
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
