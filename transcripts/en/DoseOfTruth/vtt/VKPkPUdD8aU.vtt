<v Speaker 1>How should you behave on Facebook and how should you behave on Twitter?</v>

2
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.360
<v Speaker 1>I think Twitter drives me a little bit crazy,</v>

3
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:13.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:13.880
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm on it a fair bit.</v>

6
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure it's a good thing.</v>

7
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.390
<v Speaker 1>And I tend to distribute things that are alarming,</v>

8
00:00:21.391 --> 00:00:24.330
<v Speaker 1>let's say in some sense maybe they are alarming ideological,</v>

9
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.560
<v Speaker 1>ideologically,</v>

10
00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:26.460
<v Speaker 1>they're disturbing.</v>

11
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.970
<v Speaker 1>And I was thinking about that today in preparation for this talk.</v>

12
00:00:29.971 --> 00:00:34.590
<v Speaker 1>And I wasn't really sure that was necessarily a good idea because there are a</v>

13
00:00:34.591 --> 00:00:37.050
<v Speaker 1>lot of alarming things happening all the time,</v>

14
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.670
<v Speaker 1>everywhere obviously.</v>

15
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:39.973
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

16
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.530
<v Speaker 1>and now we can share all of them always all the time.</v>

17
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.850
<v Speaker 1>And so that means that instead of hearing about one alarming thing a day,</v>

18
00:00:47.851 --> 00:00:50.490
<v Speaker 1>you're hearing about like 500 alarming things a day.</v>

19
00:00:50.491 --> 00:00:51.324
<v Speaker 1>And so then,</v>

20
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.433
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.820
<v Speaker 1>what are you supposed to do about that?</v>

22
00:00:53.821 --> 00:00:54.181
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>

23
00:00:54.181 --> 00:00:57.150
<v Speaker 1>does that indicate the state that there's a state of emergency?</v>

24
00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

25
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.300
<v Speaker 1>you don't know cause you don't know how to calibrate the information.</v>

26
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.321
<v Speaker 1>So I was thinking,</v>

27
00:01:01.321 --> 00:01:05.280
<v Speaker 1>well maybe the right way to behave on Twitter is only two forward good things</v>

28
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:06.061
<v Speaker 1>that are happening.</v>

29
00:01:06.061 --> 00:01:06.301
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

30
00:01:06.301 --> 00:01:08.190
<v Speaker 1>cause there's lots of good things that are happening.</v>

31
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.140
<v Speaker 1>But I actually don't know the answer to that.</v>

32
00:01:10.141 --> 00:01:10.251
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

33
00:01:10.251 --> 00:01:11.130
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

34
00:01:11.131 --> 00:01:12.810
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think anybody else does either.</v>

35
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.650
<v Speaker 1>I do know that there are studies with regards to Facebook that showed that the</v>

36
00:01:16.651 --> 00:01:18.300
<v Speaker 1>more time that you spend on Facebook,</v>

37
00:01:18.301 --> 00:01:22.050
<v Speaker 1>the more depressed you are and that it looks like it's a causal relationship</v>

38
00:01:22.051 --> 00:01:24.060
<v Speaker 1>rather than just a correlational relationship.</v>

39
00:01:24.061 --> 00:01:28.140
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to have something to do with the fact that Facebook is one of those</v>

40
00:01:28.141 --> 00:01:31.290
<v Speaker 1>platforms where everybody puts up an advertisement for their life.</v>

41
00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:31.501
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

42
00:01:31.501 --> 00:01:32.040
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

43
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.330
<v Speaker 1>here I am with my new girlfriend in The Bahamas being happy and here I am in a</v>

44
00:01:36.331 --> 00:01:37.350
<v Speaker 1>mountain being happy.</v>

45
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.950
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

46
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.980
<v Speaker 1>it's not you like miserable with the cover over your head,</v>

47
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.450
<v Speaker 1>unable to get out of bed.</v>

48
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.870
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>

49
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:43.703
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>

50
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.150
<v Speaker 1>you don't broadcast that.</v>

51
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.751
<v Speaker 1>You can think,</v>

52
00:01:45.751 --> 00:01:46.584
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

53
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.730
<v Speaker 1>it means you're presenting people with a falsely positive view of your life and</v>

54
00:01:50.731 --> 00:01:53.970
<v Speaker 1>then they compare their lives to it and they come up short and you think,</v>

55
00:01:53.971 --> 00:01:55.470
<v Speaker 1>well that's a kind of deception.</v>

56
00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.390
<v Speaker 1>But by the same token,</v>

57
00:01:57.391 --> 00:02:00.420
<v Speaker 1>you don't stop random strangers on the street and tell them how miserable your</v>

58
00:02:00.421 --> 00:02:00.991
<v Speaker 1>life is.</v>

59
00:02:00.991 --> 00:02:01.290
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

60
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.490
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to hear about that.</v>

61
00:02:02.491 --> 00:02:02.880
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

62
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.790
<v Speaker 1>they want to see a facade of normality in,</v>

63
00:02:05.791 --> 00:02:06.181
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

64
00:02:06.181 --> 00:02:06.630
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

65
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.991
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

66
00:02:06.991 --> 00:02:09.270
<v Speaker 1>just casual day to day interactions.</v>

67
00:02:09.271 --> 00:02:13.920
<v Speaker 1>And so part of pro social behavior is only to put what's at least,</v>

68
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:14.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

69
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.110
<v Speaker 1>normative and good forward.</v>

70
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.420
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't matter.</v>

71
00:02:18.421 --> 00:02:18.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

72
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.880
<v Speaker 1>so I don't think that's necessarily deception,</v>

73
00:02:20.881 --> 00:02:24.420
<v Speaker 1>but the mass consequences of that is something that we don't understand at all.</v>

74
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:25.763
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

75
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.730
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

76
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.170
<v Speaker 1>so with that sort of introduction,</v>

77
00:02:28.171 --> 00:02:33.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to kind of walk you through my experience with social media and let's</v>

78
00:02:33.061 --> 00:02:34.260
<v Speaker 1>say the old media,</v>

79
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.520
<v Speaker 1>for lack of a better word,</v>

80
00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:38.310
<v Speaker 1>and I'll try to give you a balanced account and to tell you,</v>

81
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.451
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

82
00:02:39.451 --> 00:02:42.030
<v Speaker 1>it's to see if I can draw some conclusions about what's happening.</v>
