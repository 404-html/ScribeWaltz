00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.850
<v Speaker 1>Told you about some of the symbolic associations that that gather around say</v>

2
00:00:10.851 --> 00:00:12.230
<v Speaker 1>images of the unknown.</v>

3
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.110
<v Speaker 1>You could also think of the unknown has unexplored territory,</v>

4
00:00:15.111 --> 00:00:19.100
<v Speaker 1>but it's a tricky kind of territory because if the person beside you does</v>

5
00:00:19.101 --> 00:00:21.020
<v Speaker 1>something spectacularly weird,</v>

6
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.610
<v Speaker 1>you move from explored territory to unexplored territory as soon as you don't</v>

7
00:00:25.611 --> 00:00:26.870
<v Speaker 1>understand what they're doing.</v>

8
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.900
<v Speaker 1>So it's not exactly spacial temper territory.</v>

9
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.460
<v Speaker 1>It's more like it's more like temporal spacial territory.</v>

10
00:00:34.461 --> 00:00:38.720
<v Speaker 1>It's time and space because the same place can be a different place from one</v>

11
00:00:38.721 --> 00:00:39.740
<v Speaker 1>moment to the next.</v>

12
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.240
<v Speaker 1>Not happens all the time when some event that you don't expect occurs in the</v>

13
00:00:44.241 --> 00:00:49.241
<v Speaker 1>place that you are so and your body is prepared to react,</v>

14
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.870
<v Speaker 1>it's instinctively prepared to react to the emergence of chaotic circumstances.</v>

15
00:00:53.871 --> 00:00:58.230
<v Speaker 1>It basically does that by hyper activating your preparation for action and</v>

16
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.570
<v Speaker 1>increasing your capacity to pay attention and preparing you to do a very large</v>

17
00:01:02.571 --> 00:01:05.210
<v Speaker 1>number of things at once because you don't know what to do.</v>

18
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.740
<v Speaker 1>It's a high stress reaction,</v>

19
00:01:06.741 --> 00:01:08.000
<v Speaker 1>but it's built into you.</v>

20
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.450
<v Speaker 1>And it's so interesting because what that means that is part of what's built</v>

21
00:01:11.451 --> 00:01:14.450
<v Speaker 1>into people is the ability to deal with what they don't understand.</v>

22
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:15.710
<v Speaker 1>This is a real paradox,</v>

23
00:01:15.711 --> 00:01:15.951
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

24
00:01:15.951 --> 00:01:18.410
<v Speaker 1>Because how can you deal with what you don't understand?</v>

25
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.940
<v Speaker 1>You don't understand it.</v>

26
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.840
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

27
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:21.740
<v Speaker 1>but the answer is,</v>

28
00:01:21.741 --> 00:01:22.400
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

29
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.400
<v Speaker 1>you ramp up your ability to react in a very large number of ways and you do that</v>

30
00:01:27.801 --> 00:01:30.620
<v Speaker 1>by increasing your general level of arousal and your attention.</v>

31
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:31.813
<v Speaker 1>And it's a good,</v>

32
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.750
<v Speaker 1>that also increases the probability that you're going to be attentive to new</v>

33
00:01:35.751 --> 00:01:39.440
<v Speaker 1>information and pull it in and utilize it so that you can decide how to act</v>

34
00:01:39.441 --> 00:01:40.274
<v Speaker 1>rapidly.</v>

35
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.650
<v Speaker 1>So other things happen.</v>

36
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:43.670
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

37
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.331
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

38
00:01:44.331 --> 00:01:48.140
<v Speaker 1>some of you may have been in car accidents or events like that where you knew</v>

39
00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:52.970
<v Speaker 1>for a few seconds that the event was going to occur and time slowed down.</v>

40
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.260
<v Speaker 1>It's quite a common,</v>

41
00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.360
<v Speaker 1>commonly reported phenomena.</v>

43
00:01:56.361 --> 00:01:58.460
<v Speaker 1>I've experienced it a number of times actually.</v>

44
00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.181
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

45
00:01:59.181 --> 00:02:00.014
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

46
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.600
<v Speaker 1>it was actually experimentally tested.</v>

47
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:03.291
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

48
00:02:03.291 --> 00:02:04.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

49
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.030
<v Speaker 1>threw people off Bungee cord apparatuses,</v>

50
00:02:08.031 --> 00:02:08.301
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

51
00:02:08.301 --> 00:02:09.530
<v Speaker 1>so apparatuses,</v>

52
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.150
<v Speaker 1>so they were plummeting down,</v>

53
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.631
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

54
00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:12.680
<v Speaker 1>in a quite frightening manner.</v>

55
00:02:12.681 --> 00:02:16.580
<v Speaker 1>And had them look at digital timers that were flashing information while they</v>

56
00:02:16.581 --> 00:02:17.211
<v Speaker 1>were falling.</v>

57
00:02:17.211 --> 00:02:20.630
<v Speaker 1>And it turned out that the people who are falling could process the digital</v>

58
00:02:20.631 --> 00:02:24.650
<v Speaker 1>information faster than people who are just standing there under normal</v>

59
00:02:24.651 --> 00:02:25.484
<v Speaker 1>circumstances.</v>

60
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.010
<v Speaker 1>How they got that passed an ethics committee is beyond me.</v>

61
00:02:28.011 --> 00:02:28.550
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

62
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:29.420
<v Speaker 1>but it's a brilliant,</v>

63
00:02:29.421 --> 00:02:31.100
<v Speaker 1>it really is a brilliant experiment.</v>
