1
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.420
<v Speaker 1>What about the disciplines on campus?</v>

2
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.980
<v Speaker 1>It seemed to be primarily devoted to the activist cause like,</v>

3
00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:15.780
<v Speaker 1>because my view is,</v>

4
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.720
<v Speaker 1>or my fear is that we've subsidized,</v>

5
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:19.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.610
<v Speaker 1>the activist disciplines,</v>

7
00:00:20.611 --> 00:00:22.410
<v Speaker 1>let's say women's studies as a good example,</v>

8
00:00:22.411 --> 00:00:26.250
<v Speaker 1>but we could say social work and then the faculties of education now as well.</v>

9
00:00:26.251 --> 00:00:27.210
<v Speaker 1>I think they're in the same,</v>

10
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.220
<v Speaker 1>in the same bin.</v>

11
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:29.611
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>

12
00:00:29.611 --> 00:00:29.910
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

13
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:30.840
<v Speaker 1>let's put it that way.</v>

14
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.990
<v Speaker 1>The women's studies programs in particular there,</v>

15
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.020
<v Speaker 1>their express goal expressed on their websites is to produce social justice,</v>

16
00:00:39.721 --> 00:00:42.240
<v Speaker 1>radical left leaning activists.</v>

17
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.430
<v Speaker 1>And so like for awhile,</v>

18
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.170
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I proposed in Canada was that the conservatives in particular</v>

19
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.640
<v Speaker 1>cut the university funding by 25% so that the universities would have to sort</v>

20
00:00:53.641 --> 00:00:54.474
<v Speaker 1>themselves out.</v>

21
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.650
<v Speaker 1>But then that was,</v>

22
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.750
<v Speaker 1>it was a provocative claim obviously.</v>

23
00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.770
<v Speaker 1>But then I thought,</v>

24
00:00:58.771 --> 00:00:58.861
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

25
00:00:58.861 --> 00:01:02.820
<v Speaker 1>that's not a good idea because it opens up the door to political interference in</v>

26
00:01:02.821 --> 00:01:03.450
<v Speaker 1>the academy.</v>

27
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:04.290
<v Speaker 1>And that's bad.</v>

28
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.010
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly,</v>

29
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:05.650
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

30
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:06.270
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

31
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.780
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

32
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.590
<v Speaker 1>But the academy's done a very bad job of policing itself methodologically.</v>

33
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.300
<v Speaker 1>And we have these disciplines.</v>

34
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.250
<v Speaker 1>Women's studies I think is a prime example.</v>

35
00:01:14.251 --> 00:01:18.030
<v Speaker 1>And that's been very much criticized in Canada by Janice Fia Manco who used to</v>

36
00:01:18.031 --> 00:01:18.181
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

37
00:01:18.181 --> 00:01:18.900
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

38
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.111
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

39
00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:19.730
<v Speaker 1>she is.</v>

40
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:20.520
<v Speaker 1>And she's,</v>

41
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.410
<v Speaker 1>she that she's not under natural mill.</v>

42
00:01:22.411 --> 00:01:23.940
<v Speaker 1>You when she's doing such things,</v>

43
00:01:23.941 --> 00:01:24.181
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:01:24.181 --> 00:01:24.511
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>

45
00:01:24.511 --> 00:01:28.950
<v Speaker 1>she's a brave and tough person and she's gone after the women's studies types on</v>

46
00:01:28.951 --> 00:01:30.780
<v Speaker 1>methodological grounds particularly.</v>

47
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.913
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

48
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.280
<v Speaker 1>but there are people who are working full time at doing nothing but producing</v>

49
00:01:37.621 --> 00:01:38.370
<v Speaker 1>the kind of polar.</v>

50
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.180
<v Speaker 1>So what do you have any lots about?</v>

51
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.471
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

52
00:01:40.471 --> 00:01:40.860
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

53
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.220
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

54
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.790
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

55
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:43.161
<v Speaker 1>here I,</v>

56
00:01:43.161 --> 00:01:46.150
<v Speaker 1>I teach in the business school here and I teach a course called professional</v>

57
00:01:46.151 --> 00:01:50.290
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and I teach my students about their fiduciary duties,</v>

58
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.150
<v Speaker 1>their duties to their employers,</v>

59
00:01:52.151 --> 00:01:53.680
<v Speaker 1>the duties that we have to each other.</v>

60
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

61
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.680
<v Speaker 1>and fiduciary duty refers to a very,</v>

62
00:01:56.681 --> 00:01:58.000
<v Speaker 1>a very high standard of care.</v>

63
00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.530
<v Speaker 1>If you're managing someone's money,</v>

64
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:00.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

65
00:02:00.251 --> 00:02:00.571
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

66
00:02:00.571 --> 00:02:03.190
<v Speaker 1>you really have to be committed to doing what's in their interest,</v>

67
00:02:03.191 --> 00:02:04.150
<v Speaker 1>not in your interest.</v>

68
00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:05.920
<v Speaker 1>And I think we need that concept.</v>

69
00:02:05.921 --> 00:02:07.600
<v Speaker 1>In the academy we have,</v>

70
00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if she would call fiduciary duties or just professional duties,</v>

71
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.920
<v Speaker 1>but I think we have two primary professional duties that we must never,</v>

72
00:02:14.921 --> 00:02:16.840
<v Speaker 1>never be tray one.</v>

73
00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.620
<v Speaker 1>The most important one in our role as scholars is our duty to the truth.</v>

74
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.100
<v Speaker 1>We must never say things that we think are false or allow people to stay,</v>

75
00:02:26.261 --> 00:02:29.530
<v Speaker 1>things that we think are false because we're afraid if we challenge them,</v>

76
00:02:29.531 --> 00:02:30.364
<v Speaker 1>we'll get in trouble.</v>

77
00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.850
<v Speaker 1>So we have a fiduciary duty to the truth and political,</v>

78
00:02:33.851 --> 00:02:36.730
<v Speaker 1>ideological commitments clearly warp us,</v>

79
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.900
<v Speaker 1>they make us do things,</v>

80
00:02:37.901 --> 00:02:38.261
<v Speaker 1>they make us,</v>

81
00:02:38.261 --> 00:02:39.094
<v Speaker 1>they push us.</v>

82
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.740
<v Speaker 1>So we've got a hole.</v>

83
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.190
<v Speaker 1>We've got to recognize that if we let our systems get out of whack,</v>

84
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.300
<v Speaker 1>we are betraying the truth.</v>

85
00:02:46.301 --> 00:02:48.370
<v Speaker 1>Where systemically do you want to?</v>

86
00:02:48.371 --> 00:02:49.450
<v Speaker 1>If we ever went systemic,</v>

87
00:02:49.451 --> 00:02:50.290
<v Speaker 1>truth isn't problem.</v>

88
00:02:50.291 --> 00:02:53.080
<v Speaker 1>We are systemically betraying the truth in many of our disciplines.</v>

89
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.110
<v Speaker 1>So I think we need an awareness of that and we need to hold ourself to a higher</v>

90
00:02:56.111 --> 00:02:56.944
<v Speaker 1>standard.</v>

91
00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.300
<v Speaker 1>They ended our role as teachers.</v>

92
00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.901
<v Speaker 1>We have,</v>

93
00:02:58.901 --> 00:03:01.330
<v Speaker 1>and we really can call it a fiduciary duty.</v>

94
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.440
<v Speaker 1>These are people's children who are sent to us to educate,</v>

95
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

96
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.660
<v Speaker 1>to enlarge their minds,</v>

97
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.950
<v Speaker 1>to teach them skills.</v>

98
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.580
<v Speaker 1>If we were to use them for our sexual pleasure,</v>

99
00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:14.890
<v Speaker 1>it's obviously a horrific crime.</v>

100
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.250
<v Speaker 1>But what is it if we use them for ideological purposes,</v>

101
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.860
<v Speaker 1>if we say you've given me your children to educate,</v>

102
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm waging a political battle.</v>

103
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try to get your statements,</v>

104
00:03:24.311 --> 00:03:24.820
<v Speaker 1>tools,</v>

105
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.470
<v Speaker 1>it's tools that is horrific,</v>

106
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.000
<v Speaker 1>that is unacceptable.</v>

107
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.530
<v Speaker 1>We are violating our duties.</v>

108
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:30.920
<v Speaker 1>So I think we need it.</v>

109
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.930
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

110
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:32.680
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>

111
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.180
<v Speaker 1>the response to that,</v>

112
00:03:34.181 --> 00:03:37.930
<v Speaker 1>especially from the postmodernist types is that that's all the ribs.</v>

113
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.160
<v Speaker 1>There's only ideologic.</v>

114
00:03:39.161 --> 00:03:39.994
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

115
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.720
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

116
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.280
<v Speaker 1>So back to original question.</v>

117
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:42.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

118
00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:43.810
<v Speaker 1>are there problem departments?</v>

119
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.673
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

120
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.540
<v Speaker 1>So I wanted to put forth these two commitments to truth and to educating,</v>

121
00:03:49.541 --> 00:03:50.420
<v Speaker 1>not indoctrinating.</v>

122
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

123
00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.420
<v Speaker 1>And universities that embrace these highest goals like the University of</v>

124
00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.421
<v Speaker 1>Chicago,</v>

125
00:03:55.421 --> 00:04:00.421
<v Speaker 1>I think is the best candidate will probably find that they need to do something</v>

126
00:04:02.891 --> 00:04:04.720
<v Speaker 1>about department that don't live up to those goals.</v>

127
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.150
<v Speaker 1>Other universities.</v>

128
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.490
<v Speaker 1>And I think Brown is leading the way on this one so far.</v>

129
00:04:09.491 --> 00:04:14.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean earlier in 2015 the president had all kinds of statements about brown is</v>

130
00:04:14.051 --> 00:04:15.370
<v Speaker 1>committed to social justice,</v>

131
00:04:15.371 --> 00:04:17.440
<v Speaker 1>a fundamental bedrock commitment to social justice.</v>

132
00:04:17.441 --> 00:04:18.274
<v Speaker 1>She said.</v>

133
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.420
<v Speaker 1>So if some universities choose to devote themselves to social justice,</v>

134
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:23.740
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

135
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.030
<v Speaker 1>Just be upfront about it.</v>

136
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.900
<v Speaker 1>Say So.</v>

137
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.720
<v Speaker 1>So students will know if you want social justice training,</v>

138
00:04:28.721 --> 00:04:29.554
<v Speaker 1>you go to Brown.</v>

139
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.860
<v Speaker 1>But if you want to actually be trained to find the truth to do research,</v>

140
00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.870
<v Speaker 1>you go to Chicago and I think we're going to see people flooding to Chicago and</v>

141
00:04:38.231 --> 00:04:38.981
<v Speaker 1>schools like it.</v>

142
00:04:38.981 --> 00:04:40.390
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm hoping,</v>

143
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.760
<v Speaker 1>what I'm hoping that's the mechanism there.</v>

144
00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:43.091
<v Speaker 1>If they,</v>

145
00:04:43.091 --> 00:04:43.760
<v Speaker 1>if they make the,</v>

146
00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.370
<v Speaker 1>if they make their statements public that the choice of the students will be to</v>

147
00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:51.970
<v Speaker 1>go to the universities that hold the principles that you just described over the</v>

148
00:04:51.971 --> 00:04:52.350
<v Speaker 1>other ones.</v>

149
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:53.590
<v Speaker 1>It will be a marketplace choice.</v>

150
00:04:53.591 --> 00:04:54.190
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

151
00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.521
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

152
00:04:54.521 --> 00:04:56.470
<v Speaker 1>So that's why I said when I talked about the emperor's new clothes,</v>

153
00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:57.730
<v Speaker 1>we have a situation,</v>

154
00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.620
<v Speaker 1>we have a gigantic market failure in which our top universities are offering a</v>

155
00:05:02.621 --> 00:05:05.410
<v Speaker 1>product that most consumers don't want.</v>

156
00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.870
<v Speaker 1>And so my prediction is that Chicago is going to see a huge surge of</v>

157
00:05:10.871 --> 00:05:12.040
<v Speaker 1>applications this year.</v>

158
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.270
<v Speaker 1>And if that's true,</v>

159
00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:13.961
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

160
00:05:13.961 --> 00:05:15.700
<v Speaker 1>I think other universities are going to,</v>

161
00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:17.443
<v Speaker 1>they're going to take notice.</v>

162
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.580
<v Speaker 1>So I'm hoping that we'll see a schism in the American academy between those</v>

163
00:05:21.581 --> 00:05:23.500
<v Speaker 1>universities that stand up and say,</v>

164
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:24.490
<v Speaker 1>this is madness.</v>

165
00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.650
<v Speaker 1>We are committed to providing a platform.</v>

166
00:05:26.651 --> 00:05:28.990
<v Speaker 1>We don't discriminate based on viewpoint and politics.</v>

167
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:30.400
<v Speaker 1>That's the Chicago way.</v>

168
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:31.361
<v Speaker 1>And those that say,</v>

169
00:05:31.361 --> 00:05:31.511
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

170
00:05:31.511 --> 00:05:32.650
<v Speaker 1>we're about social justice.</v>

171
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.860
<v Speaker 1>Come here and we will train you to fight for social justice and against the</v>

172
00:05:35.861 --> 00:05:36.694
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

173
00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.720
<v Speaker 1>So if,</v>

174
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.640
<v Speaker 1>if people have clear choices,</v>

175
00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.790
<v Speaker 1>then I think we're going to see a big change.</v>

176
00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:43.900
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I'm optimistic,</v>

177
00:05:43.901 --> 00:05:44.770
<v Speaker 1>because I think we're going to see that.</v>
