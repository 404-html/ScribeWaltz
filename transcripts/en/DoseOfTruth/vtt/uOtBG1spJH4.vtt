1
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:10.181
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2
00:00:10.181 --> 00:00:13.210
<v Speaker 1>So now we're going to go back in time to Sumeria and I'm going to show you how</v>

3
00:00:13.211 --> 00:00:15.610
<v Speaker 1>this scenario creation myth lays itself out.</v>

4
00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:16.750
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>

5
00:00:16.751 --> 00:00:21.751
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to describe to you the direct political implications of the new my</v>

6
00:00:22.661 --> 00:00:23.021
<v Speaker 1>list,</v>

7
00:00:23.021 --> 00:00:24.100
<v Speaker 1>a Sumerian creation,</v>

8
00:00:24.101 --> 00:00:24.281
<v Speaker 1>Beth,</v>

9
00:00:24.281 --> 00:00:28.510
<v Speaker 1>because the political implications of that myth are well understood because the</v>

10
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.860
<v Speaker 1>political structure of Sumeria was directly associated with the structure of the</v>

11
00:00:32.861 --> 00:00:37.861
<v Speaker 1>myth because the Sumerian emperor was regarded as the earthly representative of</v>

12
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.800
<v Speaker 1>the highest God in the Mesopotamian Pantheon whose name was Marduk.</v>

13
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.390
<v Speaker 1>So in so far as you were emperor,</v>

14
00:00:46.391 --> 00:00:47.770
<v Speaker 1>the reason that you were emperor,</v>

15
00:00:47.771 --> 00:00:52.771
<v Speaker 1>and this is what gave your sovereignty legitimacy,</v>

16
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:53.620
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

17
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.300
<v Speaker 1>Cause sovereignty has to have legitimacy,</v>

18
00:00:55.301 --> 00:00:57.040
<v Speaker 1>otherwise there's constant revolutions.</v>

19
00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.660
<v Speaker 1>What gave sovereignty legitimacy in Mesopotamia was the identification of the</v>

20
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.470
<v Speaker 1>emperor with Marduk and that hat that had certain implications for the emperor,</v>

21
00:01:05.471 --> 00:01:07.090
<v Speaker 1>which we'll discuss in some detail.</v>

22
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.070
<v Speaker 1>The story starts like this.</v>

23
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.490
<v Speaker 1>You've got this drag tie a mat.</v>

24
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.660
<v Speaker 1>And timeout is a great primordial</v>

25
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.180
<v Speaker 1>beast who lives at the bottom of the ocean and the ocean is water and water is</v>

26
00:01:25.781 --> 00:01:28.690
<v Speaker 1>associated with the primal element in archaic thinking.</v>

27
00:01:28.691 --> 00:01:30.820
<v Speaker 1>And I told you there's reasons for that already.</v>

28
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.750
<v Speaker 1>If you viewed the transformation of deserts has a consequence of rain,</v>

29
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.680
<v Speaker 1>can understand why water would be considered the element that gives life,</v>

30
00:01:38.681 --> 00:01:38.921
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

31
00:01:38.921 --> 00:01:41.290
<v Speaker 1>That the element that that brings life fourth.</v>

32
00:01:41.291 --> 00:01:43.990
<v Speaker 1>And we know from an evolutionary perspective that that's accurate.</v>

33
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.650
<v Speaker 1>And we know that we're 90% water and so to consider water,</v>

34
00:01:47.651 --> 00:01:51.220
<v Speaker 1>the primal element is no trivial conclusion.</v>

35
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.510
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

36
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.120
<v Speaker 1>no less than presuming that the sun is the ultimate source of life,</v>

37
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.200
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate God,</v>

38
00:01:56.201 --> 00:01:59.890
<v Speaker 1>because the sun is the ultimate source of life as far as we're concerned on</v>

39
00:01:59.891 --> 00:02:00.161
<v Speaker 1>earth,</v>

40
00:02:00.161 --> 00:02:00.341
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

41
00:02:00.341 --> 00:02:01.840
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's the source of all our energy.</v>

42
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.610
<v Speaker 1>These aren't stupid concepts.</v>

43
00:02:03.611 --> 00:02:03.881
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>

44
00:02:03.881 --> 00:02:08.500
<v Speaker 1>So timeout is this horrible creature that lurks at the bottom of the primal</v>

45
00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:09.420
<v Speaker 1>element.</v>

46
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:09.910
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>

47
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.680
<v Speaker 1>Now she has a husband Appsu.</v>

48
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.100
<v Speaker 1>Now the massive detain me and creation myth doesn't say much about Appsu.</v>

49
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.080
<v Speaker 1>We only know that he's the male con,</v>

50
00:02:17.081 --> 00:02:18.730
<v Speaker 1>sort of the dragon of chaos.</v>

51
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.760
<v Speaker 1>And we know from reading other sources of mythology that the male consort of the</v>

52
00:02:24.761 --> 00:02:28.570
<v Speaker 1>dragon of chaos generally represents either logos or culture.</v>

53
00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.040
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to make the presupposition in this particular case that the</v>

54
00:02:33.041 --> 00:02:35.770
<v Speaker 1>husband of chaos is order or culture.</v>

55
00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:36.191
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

56
00:02:36.191 --> 00:02:38.410
<v Speaker 1>And then the Mesopotamians don't say much about that.</v>

57
00:02:38.411 --> 00:02:39.250
<v Speaker 1>That that doesn't,</v>

58
00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.570
<v Speaker 1>the development of the idea of apps who are order or culture doesn't,</v>

59
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.200
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't take new force until the ancient Egyptians.</v>

60
00:02:47.201 --> 00:02:48.460
<v Speaker 1>We'll talk about them today too.</v>

61
00:02:48.461 --> 00:02:48.731
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

62
00:02:48.731 --> 00:02:53.731
<v Speaker 1>so ty about naps who are locked into a kind of sexual embrace according to the</v>

63
00:02:54.491 --> 00:02:55.690
<v Speaker 1>Mesopotamian creation myth.</v>

64
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.130
<v Speaker 1>And what does that mean?</v>

65
00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:58.510
<v Speaker 1>It kind of means two things.</v>

66
00:02:58.511 --> 00:03:02.800
<v Speaker 1>It means that they're not really distinguishable because they're locked into</v>

67
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:03.640
<v Speaker 1>this embrace.</v>

68
00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:07.900
<v Speaker 1>And it also means that they're up to something creative because the act of</v>

69
00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:11.800
<v Speaker 1>sexual congress in mythology is most usefully,</v>

70
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.690
<v Speaker 1>is most frequently utilized,</v>

71
00:03:13.691 --> 00:03:18.691
<v Speaker 1>has representation of something creative or as representation of the probability</v>

72
00:03:18.971 --> 00:03:20.860
<v Speaker 1>of some new form coming to be.</v>

73
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:21.590
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

74
00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:22.001
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

75
00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:27.001
<v Speaker 1>so abso in timeout are locked into this embrace in a state that other creation</v>

76
00:03:31.151 --> 00:03:32.630
<v Speaker 1>myths describe as egg.</v>

77
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.720
<v Speaker 1>Like the pre cosmo Gornick egg,</v>

78
00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.660
<v Speaker 1>there are intermingling gives rise to the initial state of being according to</v>

79
00:03:41.661 --> 00:03:42.401
<v Speaker 1>the Sumerians.</v>

80
00:03:42.401 --> 00:03:46.970
<v Speaker 1>And the initial state of being according to the Sumerians is characterized by</v>

81
00:03:46.971 --> 00:03:49.040
<v Speaker 1>the dominion of the elder gods.</v>

82
00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.270
<v Speaker 1>These gods being none too bright,</v>

83
00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.650
<v Speaker 1>make a tremendous amount of rack doing things well.</v>

84
00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:59.960
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean exactly?</v>

85
00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:02.443
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

86
00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.970
<v Speaker 1>it means something like this.</v>

87
00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.340
<v Speaker 1>They make a lot of racket and they cause a lot of trouble.</v>

88
00:04:07.341 --> 00:04:12.050
<v Speaker 1>They make a lot of wind and all of the racket and trouble and wind and activity</v>

89
00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.430
<v Speaker 1>rouses tie amat.</v>

90
00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:15.373
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

91
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.311
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

92
00:04:18.311 --> 00:04:20.020
<v Speaker 1>it means if you do things and get in trouble,</v>

93
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.870
<v Speaker 1>it means even if you're trying to solve problems,</v>

94
00:04:22.871 --> 00:04:25.660
<v Speaker 1>you get into trouble because the solution to a problem,</v>

95
00:04:25.661 --> 00:04:28.330
<v Speaker 1>Chin tends to generate a whole bunch of new problems,</v>

96
00:04:28.331 --> 00:04:28.511
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

97
00:04:28.511 --> 00:04:29.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like the Hydra.</v>

98
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.770
<v Speaker 1>So what it means is that it's more or less fated that any form of activity</v>

99
00:04:36.671 --> 00:04:37.690
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever</v>

100
00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.890
<v Speaker 1>is likely to produce the threat of catastrophe.</v>

101
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.701
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>

102
00:04:45.701 --> 00:04:49.600
<v Speaker 1>we're absolutely keenly aware of that in the modern world because we are</v>

103
00:04:49.601 --> 00:04:53.560
<v Speaker 1>possessed by this sense that all of our frenetic activity,</v>

104
00:04:53.561 --> 00:04:58.390
<v Speaker 1>all of our frenetic motivated activity is producing alterations in the world</v>

105
00:04:58.391 --> 00:05:03.391
<v Speaker 1>order such that nature itself is going to be destroyed and eliminate us.</v>
