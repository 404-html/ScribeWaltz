00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.380
<v Speaker 1>Jesus christ founded his religion within an empire.</v>

2
00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:15.381
<v Speaker 1>The Roman empire existed before and what he was talking about was all religion.</v>

3
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.460
<v Speaker 1>Where as Mohammad on the phone did an empire,</v>

4
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.733
<v Speaker 1>we forget.</v>

5
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:20.311
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

6
00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:20.611
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

7
00:00:20.611 --> 00:00:22.170
<v Speaker 1>That's a very important distinction.</v>

8
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:23.131
<v Speaker 1>I mean it really,</v>

9
00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:26.880
<v Speaker 1>and it made might be the crucial distinction sort of speak the crucial</v>

10
00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:27.340
<v Speaker 1>distinction.</v>

11
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:27.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

12
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.840
<v Speaker 1>And there was this empire and this empire bows and decline and fell and those</v>

13
00:00:32.971 --> 00:00:35.190
<v Speaker 1>who feel that they have inherited that legacy,</v>

14
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.460
<v Speaker 1>they want to go back to the days of [inaudible].</v>

15
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:38.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

16
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.640
<v Speaker 1>Go back to the days when his loud voice to previous and they want to do this in</v>

17
00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:45.660
<v Speaker 1>the 21st century.</v>

18
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.073
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

19
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.010
<v Speaker 1>All kinds.</v>

20
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.010
<v Speaker 1>It's not just that you called camp on horseback and invade an existing empire.</v>

21
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:54.880
<v Speaker 1>The Byzantine like</v>

22
00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.770
<v Speaker 1>easy and empires.</v>

23
00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:58.981
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

24
00:00:58.981 --> 00:01:01.110
<v Speaker 1>he took off and you could just take things off.</v>

25
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:02.280
<v Speaker 1>It's not like that,</v>

26
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:03.413
<v Speaker 1>but they're driven.</v>

27
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.903
<v Speaker 1>They're convinced.</v>

28
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.430
<v Speaker 1>They have this legacy and they're not afraid of death.</v>

29
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.680
<v Speaker 1>And how is key because,</v>

30
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.140
<v Speaker 1>and here's why I keep going back to Dow.</v>

31
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.360
<v Speaker 1>All Muslim children learn that life on this as this temple.</v>

32
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:19.310
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

33
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.143
<v Speaker 1>As your tree.</v>

34
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.120
<v Speaker 1>And that there is something in the here then this,</v>

35
00:01:22.121 --> 00:01:25.070
<v Speaker 1>there's no point in investing in this life except in,</v>

36
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.200
<v Speaker 1>and they just started that.</v>

37
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.780
<v Speaker 1>So for the Medina Muslims,</v>

38
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.030
<v Speaker 1>it really becomes easy to recruit and inspire into their parents.</v>

39
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.060
<v Speaker 1>Muslims who have already been taught that if they've only got to work for the</v>

40
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.730
<v Speaker 1>hereafter problems with Islam.</v>

41
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:42.860
<v Speaker 1>And I think it was,</v>

42
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.000
<v Speaker 1>we understand that of course,</v>

43
00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:46.230
<v Speaker 1>the basic LMS,</v>

44
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.600
<v Speaker 1>Mohammed Straw,</v>

45
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.610
<v Speaker 1>all of the Koran,</v>

46
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.210
<v Speaker 1>the fall of the he after all of these things and what should it mean?</v>

47
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.290
<v Speaker 1>And then it gets to the Dow accounts.</v>

48
00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.570
<v Speaker 1>This is how they manage to teach young people.</v>

49
00:02:00.571 --> 00:02:04.320
<v Speaker 1>How do they manage the teachable for these thousands and millions of people who</v>

50
00:02:04.321 --> 00:02:07.050
<v Speaker 1>is subsidizing these countries like Saudi Arabia,</v>

51
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.820
<v Speaker 1>Qatar.</v>

52
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.430
<v Speaker 1>We understand that.</v>

53
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.400
<v Speaker 1>I think it makes our job as westerners western last,</v>

54
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.700
<v Speaker 1>whatever's easiest.</v>
