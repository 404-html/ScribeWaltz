00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.280
<v Speaker 1>If the right to identify with certain arguments has to be earned.</v>

2
00:00:10.281 --> 00:00:11.390
<v Speaker 1>How does one earn it?</v>

3
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.850
<v Speaker 1>How do we truthfully discuss ideas</v>

4
00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:17.290
<v Speaker 1>for which we have not earned it?</v>

5
00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.020
<v Speaker 1>That's been wood.</v>

6
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.900
<v Speaker 1>If the right to identify with certain arguments has to be earned,</v>

7
00:00:41.901 --> 00:00:42.950
<v Speaker 1>how does one earn it?</v>

8
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.751
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

9
00:00:44.751 --> 00:00:49.751
<v Speaker 1>I think you start by feeling out physiologically what arguments you do have the</v>

10
00:00:52.911 --> 00:00:55.610
<v Speaker 1>right to make and when,</v>

11
00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.470
<v Speaker 1>and that's that meditative consultation practice that we talked about earlier.</v>

12
00:01:00.471 --> 00:01:01.304
<v Speaker 1>You have to</v>

13
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.680
<v Speaker 1>pay attention to your words and see if when you utter them,</v>

14
00:01:06.681 --> 00:01:08.390
<v Speaker 1>they put you in a solid place.</v>

15
00:01:08.391 --> 00:01:11.390
<v Speaker 1>That's the line between chaos and order as far as I'm concerned.</v>

16
00:01:11.391 --> 00:01:16.391
<v Speaker 1>And you can test continually that the extensibility of your arguments by doing</v>

17
00:01:18.591 --> 00:01:19.424
<v Speaker 1>so you can,</v>

18
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.110
<v Speaker 1>you can implement more and more sophisticated arguments as you get better and</v>

19
00:01:24.111 --> 00:01:28.070
<v Speaker 1>better at finding that place to stand and take on larger and larger problems.</v>

20
00:01:28.071 --> 00:01:29.570
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's the other part of it is,</v>

21
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:30.763
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.720
<v Speaker 1>how do you earn the right to,</v>

23
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:33.230
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

24
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.951
<v Speaker 1>to an argument,</v>

25
00:01:33.951 --> 00:01:34.784
<v Speaker 1>to a position,</v>

26
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:36.650
<v Speaker 1>pick a small problem,</v>

27
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.720
<v Speaker 1>one that you think you could solve,</v>

28
00:01:38.721 --> 00:01:40.970
<v Speaker 1>but that's a little more than you can chew.</v>

29
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.820
<v Speaker 1>You know that bite off a little more than you can chew but not too much.</v>

30
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.080
<v Speaker 1>Then see if you can be successful at solving it and then that'll strengthen and</v>

31
00:01:48.081 --> 00:01:49.250
<v Speaker 1>put things in order a little bit.</v>

32
00:01:49.251 --> 00:01:53.780
<v Speaker 1>And then that will entitle you to the use of certain arguments and those</v>

33
00:01:53.781 --> 00:01:56.060
<v Speaker 1>arguments we related to what you've just done.</v>

34
00:01:56.061 --> 00:01:57.770
<v Speaker 1>And then as soon as you've done that,</v>

35
00:01:57.771 --> 00:02:00.080
<v Speaker 1>you'll be a little stronger and more put together and then you can take on a</v>

36
00:02:00.081 --> 00:02:04.610
<v Speaker 1>little bit bigger problem and fix that and then the same thing will happen.</v>

37
00:02:04.611 --> 00:02:05.780
<v Speaker 1>And you just keep doing that.</v>

38
00:02:05.781 --> 00:02:08.120
<v Speaker 1>It's like progressive weightlifting and that,</v>

39
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.931
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>

40
00:02:08.931 --> 00:02:12.290
<v Speaker 1>you can't truthfully discuss ideas that you haven't yet earned.</v>

41
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.363
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

42
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.410
<v Speaker 1>you have to be quiet,</v>

43
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.590
<v Speaker 1>you have to listen or you have to think about something else.</v>

44
00:02:18.591 --> 00:02:19.401
<v Speaker 1>You have to do something else.</v>

45
00:02:19.401 --> 00:02:20.360
<v Speaker 1>There's lots to do.</v>

46
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.110
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

47
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.620
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to engage in arguments that you don't have any right to engage in</v>

48
00:02:24.621 --> 00:02:28.580
<v Speaker 1>when there's all sorts of things you can engage in right in front of you that</v>

49
00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:29.720
<v Speaker 1>would fully engage you,</v>

50
00:02:29.721 --> 00:02:32.150
<v Speaker 1>that would be very useful and that you could contribute to,</v>

51
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.171
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

52
00:02:33.171 --> 00:02:35.480
<v Speaker 1>I really liked this idea of incremental improvement.</v>

53
00:02:35.481 --> 00:02:35.901
<v Speaker 1>It's soul,</v>

54
00:02:35.901 --> 00:02:36.950
<v Speaker 1>it's such a good idea.</v>

55
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.233
<v Speaker 1>You look around,</v>

56
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.630
<v Speaker 1>like I have this room that I'm in right now and it's kind of messy.</v>

57
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.260
<v Speaker 1>I know I tell people to keep their room clean and I'd been trying to clean up</v>

58
00:02:45.261 --> 00:02:47.540
<v Speaker 1>this room since like last January,</v>

59
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.870
<v Speaker 1>but I guess because so much chaos is being generated around me in some sense</v>

60
00:02:54.381 --> 00:02:56.480
<v Speaker 1>that some of it's flooded into this room.</v>

61
00:02:56.481 --> 00:02:58.160
<v Speaker 1>The rest of the house is in really good order,</v>

62
00:02:58.161 --> 00:03:00.490
<v Speaker 1>but the residual is still in this room.</v>

63
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:01.750
<v Speaker 1>But when I come in here,</v>

64
00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:02.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

65
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.333
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

66
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.650
<v Speaker 1>I try to spend five minutes to clean up a bit of correspondence or something and</v>

67
00:03:08.651 --> 00:03:08.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

68
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm definitely making progress.</v>

69
00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:12.100
<v Speaker 1>The room is in much better shape than it was.</v>

70
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.433
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

71
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.040
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

72
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.070
<v Speaker 1>Don't underestimate the utility of incremental improvement,</v>

73
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.230
<v Speaker 1>and you strengthen yourself by doing that.</v>

74
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.690
<v Speaker 1>And then you can talk about the things that you've actually done,</v>

75
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.561
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

76
00:03:23.561 --> 00:03:27.460
<v Speaker 1>in detail in the kind of detail that would convince someone who is skeptical and</v>

77
00:03:27.461 --> 00:03:30.040
<v Speaker 1>knowledgeable that you are someone who knew what they were talking about.</v>

78
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.170
<v Speaker 1>And then if you do that over 10 years,</v>

79
00:03:32.171 --> 00:03:33.004
<v Speaker 1>like you'll,</v>

80
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.850
<v Speaker 1>you'll be solid.</v>

81
00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:34.684
<v Speaker 1>You'll,</v>

82
00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.770
<v Speaker 1>the breadth of argumentation that you'll have at your fingertips will vastly</v>

83
00:03:38.771 --> 00:03:39.370
<v Speaker 1>improve.</v>
