1
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you've seen the sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous a animation to be used</v>

2
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.190
<v Speaker 1>animated drawings like the ginger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the genderbread person or the gender</v>

3
00:00:15.191 --> 00:00:16.024
<v Speaker 1>Unicorn.</v>

4
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.493
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have.</v>

6
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so those are being pushed forward</v>

7
00:00:22.291 --> 00:00:24.930
<v Speaker 1>very hard in institutions all across</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada,</v>

8
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.060
<v Speaker 1>elementary schools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>junior high schools,</v>

9
00:00:27.061 --> 00:00:28.530
<v Speaker 1>the military,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the police,</v>

10
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.170
<v Speaker 1>you name it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where there's this tremendous emphasis</v>

11
00:00:31.171 --> 00:00:34.800
<v Speaker 1>on the social construction of identity</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's as if the social</v>

12
00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:39.801
<v Speaker 1>constructionists have taken to the law</v>
<v Speaker 1>to enforce what they cannot prove</v>

13
00:00:39.901 --> 00:00:43.980
<v Speaker 1>scientifically what they failed to prove</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientifically or what's even being</v>

14
00:00:43.981 --> 00:00:46.710
<v Speaker 1>disproved scientifically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be more accurate way of</v>

15
00:00:46.711 --> 00:00:49.380
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the fact that there was an all out</v>

16
00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:53.100
<v Speaker 1>assault on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on biology by the left is unbelievably.</v>

17
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm ominous in my estimation.</v>

18
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

19
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.960
<v Speaker 2>Just two things on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got an article coming out on</v>

20
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.560
<v Speaker 2>written by two evolutionary</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologists on the false dichotomy</v>

21
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.430
<v Speaker 2>between sex and gender and they give it</v>
<v Speaker 2>some historical context.</v>

22
00:01:14.071 --> 00:01:17.640
<v Speaker 2>So the fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That false dichotomy I think started</v>

23
00:01:17.641 --> 00:01:19.200
<v Speaker 2>with Moonee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

24
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's.</v>

25
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.380
<v Speaker 2>And then it was weaponized by feminists</v>
<v Speaker 2>to deny biology entered denied sex</v>

26
00:01:28.381 --> 00:01:29.790
<v Speaker 2>differences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically.</v>

27
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.640
<v Speaker 2>So that's it.</v>

28
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.070
<v Speaker 1>Very strange thing for feminists to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that James Demore has</v>

29
00:01:38.231 --> 00:01:41.020
<v Speaker 1>just pointed out lately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the guy that wrote that memo for</v>

30
00:01:41.021 --> 00:01:42.850
<v Speaker 1>Google,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that</v>

31
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.280
<v Speaker 1>the problem with denying the sex</v>
<v Speaker 1>differences is that you automatically</v>

32
00:01:48.281 --> 00:01:51.370
<v Speaker 1>make the argument that if there are sex</v>
<v Speaker 1>differences,</v>

33
00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.150
<v Speaker 1>essentially they're making the argument</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the female differences or something</v>

34
00:01:55.151 --> 00:01:59.530
<v Speaker 1>like inferior because why would you</v>
<v Speaker 1>object to their existence otherwise?</v>

35
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.190
<v Speaker 1>And memo was actually quite careful</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he said,</v>

36
00:02:03.191 --> 00:02:06.400
<v Speaker 1>well we should take a look at these</v>
<v Speaker 1>differences and if we want to maximize</v>

37
00:02:06.401 --> 00:02:10.090
<v Speaker 1>the economic utility of women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which seems to be a reasonable thing to</v>

38
00:02:10.091 --> 00:02:12.370
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we should actually have a serious</v>

39
00:02:12.371 --> 00:02:15.220
<v Speaker 1>discussion about what the differences</v>
<v Speaker 1>are and see if we could set up our</v>

40
00:02:15.221 --> 00:02:18.890
<v Speaker 1>institution so that we can take</v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage of the,</v>

41
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.970
<v Speaker 1>of the difference in perspective and</v>
<v Speaker 1>orientation.</v>

42
00:02:21.971 --> 00:02:24.310
<v Speaker 1>But the two sexes might bring to bear on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

43
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.460
<v Speaker 1>on the workplace and on economic issues</v>
<v Speaker 1>in general.</v>

44
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.620
<v Speaker 1>And you don't use that happening because</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are starting to sort themselves</v>

45
00:02:32.621 --> 00:02:36.640
<v Speaker 1>out into occupations bisects</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially.</v>

46
00:02:36.641 --> 00:02:39.940
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the longterm social consequences of that</v>

47
00:02:39.941 --> 00:02:42.520
<v Speaker 1>aren't obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we don't know how to balance that,</v>

48
00:02:42.521 --> 00:02:43.690
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't,</v>

49
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.450
<v Speaker 1>it isn't necessarily the case that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bad thing.</v>

50
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.490
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

51
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.510
<v Speaker 2>And my position has always been that</v>
<v Speaker 2>women have probably more to lose when</v>

52
00:02:54.301 --> 00:02:59.301
<v Speaker 2>sex differences are denied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think because of women's biological</v>

53
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.130
<v Speaker 2>clock and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that we bear much more of a</v>

54
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:09.160
<v Speaker 2>burden when it comes to child bearing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and child weary.</v>

55
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.520
<v Speaker 2>If you denied that</v>
<v Speaker 2>women pay a huge price,</v>

56
00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:18.010
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you denied the fact that what women</v>

57
00:03:18.011 --> 00:03:21.550
<v Speaker 2>go through that to bear children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Firstly,</v>

58
00:03:21.551 --> 00:03:25.300
<v Speaker 2>I think we need to separate mothers out</v>
<v Speaker 2>from women.</v>

59
00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.590
<v Speaker 2>There's this sort of a conflation when</v>
<v Speaker 2>we talk about things like the gender gap</v>

60
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.170
<v Speaker 2>where there's a lot of the rhetoric</v>
<v Speaker 2>implies that all women are discriminated</v>

61
00:03:35.171 --> 00:03:39.350
<v Speaker 2>against the women who pay a penalty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our mothers and we,</v>

62
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.440
<v Speaker 2>we need to talk about that more and we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we shouldn't minimize the,</v>

63
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.900
<v Speaker 2>the work and the sacrifice and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of the,</v>

64
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:50.271
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

65
00:03:50.271 --> 00:03:55.271
<v Speaker 2>the costs and the energy that we've been</v>
<v Speaker 2>pouring into that.</v>

66
00:03:55.361 --> 00:03:58.060
<v Speaker 2>And I think when we do ny sex</v>
<v Speaker 2>differences,</v>

67
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.120
<v Speaker 2>we sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

68
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:02.770
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do,</v>

69
00:04:02.771 --> 00:04:04.380
<v Speaker 2>we minimize and we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

70
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.140
<v Speaker 2>sort of dismiss everything that women do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is female normally receive,</v>

71
00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.780
<v Speaker 2>such as caring and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

72
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.840
<v Speaker 2>and working for others and sacrificing</v>
<v Speaker 2>pay for their children.</v>

73
00:04:18.851 --> 00:04:20.560
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of these things.</v>

74
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:23.060
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

75
00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.000
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you.</v>

76
00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.010
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a month ago we were talking to her</v>
<v Speaker 1>last night.</v>

77
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.910
<v Speaker 1>She's trying to finish up her degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's also had some health problems that</v>

78
00:04:32.911 --> 00:04:34.420
<v Speaker 1>have interfered with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

79
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.740
<v Speaker 1>she was talking to us last night about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

80
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.640
<v Speaker 1>She looked tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had bags under her eyes.</v>

81
00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean she's very happy to have the baby</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's going very well and all of</v>

82
00:04:41.761 --> 00:04:44.100
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the first year after you have a</v>

83
00:04:44.101 --> 00:04:45.750
<v Speaker 1>baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're basically done.</v>

84
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.600
<v Speaker 1>You don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get any sleep.</v>

85
00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.530
<v Speaker 1>You're absolutely overwhelmed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially for the first six months with</v>

86
00:04:52.531 --> 00:04:54.960
<v Speaker 1>a new instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're a first time mother</v>

87
00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:57.690
<v Speaker 1>because like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell do you know about taking</v>

88
00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.850
<v Speaker 1>care of this incredibly complicated</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

89
00:04:59.851 --> 00:05:03.960
<v Speaker 1>And it produces all sorts of biochemical</v>
<v Speaker 1>changes and it's really hard on your</v>

90
00:05:03.961 --> 00:05:08.520
<v Speaker 1>body and there's a long recovery period</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're much more dependent on your</v>

91
00:05:08.521 --> 00:05:10.960
<v Speaker 1>familial structure than you were before.</v>

92
00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.580
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

93
00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:14.490
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

94
00:05:14.491 --> 00:05:16.920
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy that we even have to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>this conversation,</v>

95
00:05:16.921 --> 00:05:20.400
<v Speaker 1>but I like your distinction between</v>
<v Speaker 1>women and mothers and you know,</v>

96
00:05:20.401 --> 00:05:22.920
<v Speaker 1>there's one of the problems that I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>had with,</v>

97
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.590
<v Speaker 1>with classic feminism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you could use that term,</v>

98
00:05:25.591 --> 00:05:29.820
<v Speaker 1>is that there's absolutely no respect</v>
<v Speaker 1>built into it for the maternal role.</v>

99
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.020
<v Speaker 1>And I really think that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's appalling on a variety of levels,</v>

100
00:05:34.021 --> 00:05:38.070
<v Speaker 1>including appalling for men because like</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I've experienced is</v>

101
00:05:38.071 --> 00:05:42.060
<v Speaker 1>that I've had a pretty intense career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

102
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.320
<v Speaker 1>I've been very fortunate in that manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had a lot of familial support and</v>

103
00:05:46.321 --> 00:05:48.690
<v Speaker 1>support from my wife for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

104
00:05:48.691 --> 00:05:53.160
<v Speaker 1>we kind of parsed our life up in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively traditional manner because</v>

105
00:05:53.161 --> 00:05:56.430
<v Speaker 1>she was quite interested in having</v>
<v Speaker 1>children by the time we got together.</v>

106
00:05:56.431 --> 00:06:00.440
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was perfectly willing to go along with</v>

107
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:05.090
<v Speaker 1>artists if I could also continue what</v>
<v Speaker 1>are my career pursuits,</v>

108
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.820
<v Speaker 1>which were also necessary for our</v>
<v Speaker 1>financial stability.</v>

109
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.380
<v Speaker 1>But for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the domestic realm has been an</v>

110
00:06:11.381 --> 00:06:13.930
<v Speaker 1>incredibly meaningful part of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

111
00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.940
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really happy in my marriage and</v>

112
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:20.940
<v Speaker 1>blast I would say in my marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I loved having kids and,</v>

113
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.620
<v Speaker 1>and for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my home has always been a refuge from,</v>

114
00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.740
<v Speaker 1>from the insanity of the world in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

115
00:06:27.741 --> 00:06:32.741
<v Speaker 1>And I think our society is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so crazily skewed towards public</v>

116
00:06:32.991 --> 00:06:36.770
<v Speaker 1>performance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say that we've denied the utility</v>

117
00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:41.771
<v Speaker 1>of the domestic sphere and that really</v>
<v Speaker 1>is terrible for women because especially</v>

118
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.050
<v Speaker 1>with regards to kids because that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

119
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.050
<v Speaker 1>that is the role that they dominate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

120
00:06:48.051 --> 00:06:51.710
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Dominique did they contribute most</v>

121
00:06:51.711 --> 00:06:53.750
<v Speaker 1>mightily to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's put it that way.</v>

122
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.510
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost as if our society</v>

123
00:06:56.511 --> 00:06:58.540
<v Speaker 1>regardless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is kind of an emphasis on,</v>

124
00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:00.830
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's crazy.</v>

125
00:07:00.831 --> 00:07:02.480
<v Speaker 1>I think it makes people miserable.</v>

126
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:09.810
<v Speaker 2>And I understand why the early feminists</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of downplayed the domestic sphere</v>

127
00:07:12.801 --> 00:07:16.130
<v Speaker 2>because they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were trapped in the domestic sphere</v>

128
00:07:16.131 --> 00:07:21.131
<v Speaker 2>and they wanted opportunities and I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm one of those women who would have</v>

129
00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:26.840
<v Speaker 2>been an early feminist probably because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I crave intellectual stimulation and I</v>

130
00:07:26.841 --> 00:07:29.600
<v Speaker 2>would have been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'd never had an opportunity to have</v>

131
00:07:29.601 --> 00:07:31.610
<v Speaker 2>a career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have been bored and that kind of</v>

132
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:36.640
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But now in 2017 I can go and get a job</v>

133
00:07:37.281 --> 00:07:40.160
<v Speaker 2>as a psychologist that can run a website</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

134
00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:43.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can do everything that a man can,</v>

135
00:07:43.761 --> 00:07:48.170
<v Speaker 2>but I'm still biologically a female.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when it comes to having kids,</v>

136
00:07:48.171 --> 00:07:51.500
<v Speaker 2>a cost is on me and the women in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

137
00:07:51.501 --> 00:07:52.720
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

138
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.430
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my own mother who super maternal and</v>

139
00:07:55.431 --> 00:08:00.230
<v Speaker 2>comes and helps with the children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see how we don't keep that status and</v>

140
00:08:00.231 --> 00:08:01.980
<v Speaker 2>prestige anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

141
00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:06.530
<v Speaker 2>it's just this a male normative sphere</v>
<v Speaker 2>where</v>

142
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:11.630
<v Speaker 2>you can monetize something or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>

143
00:08:11.631 --> 00:08:13.520
<v Speaker 2>public performance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can,</v>

144
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:18.140
<v Speaker 2>we afford that status and prestige.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this invisible caring work that</v>

145
00:08:18.141 --> 00:08:21.980
<v Speaker 2>women are so good at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some women are exceptional that it's</v>

146
00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.650
<v Speaker 2>supported,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no prestige whatsoever.</v>

147
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:25.800
<v Speaker 2>There's often not</v>

148
00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or notice for little kids,</v>

149
00:08:28.681 --> 00:08:30.740
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though our little kids were very</v>

150
00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:33.090
<v Speaker 1>well behaved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that she was treated,</v>

151
00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:35.640
<v Speaker 1>she wasn't treated well in the public</v>
<v Speaker 1>sphere,</v>

152
00:08:35.641 --> 00:08:39.360
<v Speaker 1>she wasn't treated well in restaurants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people were afraid.</v>

153
00:08:39.361 --> 00:08:41.460
<v Speaker 1>I think that was part of it in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

154
00:08:41.461 --> 00:08:43.080
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were afraid that if she showed up</v>

155
00:08:43.081 --> 00:08:46.290
<v Speaker 1>in a public place with children that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there would be disruption of one form or</v>

156
00:08:46.291 --> 00:08:47.124
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

157
00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:51.330
<v Speaker 1>but it was certainly the case that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would say she received the opposite of</v>

158
00:08:51.331 --> 00:08:56.331
<v Speaker 1>respect and look deeply into architect</v>
<v Speaker 1>will symbolism and the function that it</v>

159
00:08:56.641 --> 00:08:57.570
<v Speaker 1>plays in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

160
00:08:57.571 --> 00:09:02.040
<v Speaker 1>one of the divine images that sits at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom of western culture and</v>

161
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:06.540
<v Speaker 1>Western culture is the image of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>divine mother and the mother of the</v>

162
00:09:06.541 --> 00:09:09.570
<v Speaker 1>savior of humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an archetypal idea because</v>

163
00:09:09.571 --> 00:09:13.140
<v Speaker 1>every baby has the possibility of</v>
<v Speaker 1>growing up to be a redemptive figure.</v>

164
00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.230
<v Speaker 1>Now that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the reason that that's an</v>

165
00:09:16.231 --> 00:09:20.400
<v Speaker 1>archetypal figures because any society</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't worship but so to speak</v>

166
00:09:20.401 --> 00:09:24.390
<v Speaker 1>doesn't give it a very high value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will nourish.</v>

167
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:29.250
<v Speaker 1>Now the fact if the declining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the catastrophic declining birth rate in</v>

168
00:09:29.251 --> 00:09:33.750
<v Speaker 1>the West is a real example of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>willful blindness towards that sacred</v>

169
00:09:33.751 --> 00:09:37.980
<v Speaker 1>image and it's a big problem and it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the case that I think if,</v>

170
00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:41.400
<v Speaker 1>if the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the feminists we're actually working</v>

171
00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:45.630
<v Speaker 1>on behalf of femininity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is essentially what they claim,</v>

172
00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:49.320
<v Speaker 1>that they would be working a hell of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot harder to elevate the status of</v>

173
00:09:49.321 --> 00:09:50.190
<v Speaker 1>mothers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

174
00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:51.091
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other than women,</v>

175
00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:53.280
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a really good distinction</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're drawing.</v>

176
00:09:53.281 --> 00:09:55.140
<v Speaker 1>Even though it seems rather self</v>
<v Speaker 1>evident,</v>

177
00:09:55.141 --> 00:09:56.310
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

178
00:09:56.311 --> 00:09:58.560
<v Speaker 1>and you're not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you become a mother,</v>

179
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:03.180
<v Speaker 1>you're a different sort of person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I also think women who don't have</v>

180
00:10:03.181 --> 00:10:06.280
<v Speaker 1>children or rather intimidated and</v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid of that,</v>

181
00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:10.200
<v Speaker 1>and that's perfectly understandable</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it isn't radical transformation.</v>

182
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.900
<v Speaker 1>But I would also say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've thought this for years,</v>

183
00:10:12.901 --> 00:10:16.770
<v Speaker 1>that you don't actually become mature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't actually become an adult until</v>

184
00:10:16.771 --> 00:10:19.470
<v Speaker 1>you have children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know that that's a statement that</v>

185
00:10:19.471 --> 00:10:24.090
<v Speaker 1>irritates the hell out of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's something that I stand by it.</v>

186
00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:27.810
<v Speaker 1>You're not an adult until someone else</v>
<v Speaker 1>matters more than you do.</v>

187
00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:33.740
<v Speaker 1>And</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make real sacrifices.</v>

188
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:35.550
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

189
00:10:35.551 --> 00:10:37.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and especially as a mother,</v>

190
00:10:37.981 --> 00:10:42.050
<v Speaker 1>you sacrifice yourself as the person of</v>
<v Speaker 1>prime importance and,</v>

191
00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:43.710
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

192
00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:44.553
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do it,</v>

193
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:48.630
<v Speaker 1>I suppose happily in some sense because</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally you fall in love with your</v>

194
00:10:48.631 --> 00:10:52.890
<v Speaker 1>baby relatively rapidly and thank God</v>
<v Speaker 1>for that because their lots of trouble.</v>

195
00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:54.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

196
00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:58.500
<v Speaker 1>I was recounting the story of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter and she is trying to.</v>

197
00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:01.650
<v Speaker 1>She was planning to take a course in</v>
<v Speaker 1>biology online this,</v>

198
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:05.820
<v Speaker 1>this semester in order to move towards</v>
<v Speaker 1>the completion of her degree.</v>

199
00:11:05.821 --> 00:11:08.630
<v Speaker 1>And we told her last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she said she was overwhelmed when we</v>

200
00:11:08.631 --> 00:11:12.120
<v Speaker 1>went and talked to her last night and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>told her just to leave it be because</v>

201
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:17.350
<v Speaker 1>first year is so intense that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're completely overwhelmed by it.</v>

202
00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:22.830
<v Speaker 1>And it's necessary because you want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get your baby off to a good start and</v>

203
00:11:22.831 --> 00:11:24.900
<v Speaker 1>get that relationship functioning</v>
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>
