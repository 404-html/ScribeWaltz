00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.150
<v Speaker 1>What is the story behind the logo that you use in your intros?</v>

2
00:00:04.151 --> 00:00:05.260
<v Speaker 1>Where did it come from?</v>

3
00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:06.761
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

4
00:00:06.761 --> 00:00:11.761
<v Speaker 1>that logo is called the meaning of music and it's actually a sculpture that I</v>

5
00:00:12.011 --> 00:00:16.050
<v Speaker 1>made in 1985 that's about five and a half feet by half,</v>

6
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.940
<v Speaker 1>five and a half feet and about eight inches thick.</v>

7
00:00:18.941 --> 00:00:20.470
<v Speaker 1>And it's made out of foam core,</v>

8
00:00:20.471 --> 00:00:21.790
<v Speaker 1>which is this bed.</v>

9
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:22.660
<v Speaker 1>It's a sub.</v>

10
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.370
<v Speaker 1>It's a material that's often used as a backing for paintings or for when you get</v>

11
00:00:27.371 --> 00:00:27.971
<v Speaker 1>them framed,</v>

12
00:00:27.971 --> 00:00:32.110
<v Speaker 1>it's it's styrofoam sheet about a quarter of an inch thick with paper on both</v>

13
00:00:32.111 --> 00:00:34.960
<v Speaker 1>sides and you can cut it very accurately with an exacto knife.</v>

14
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.660
<v Speaker 1>And so what I did was make a stack of those uh,</v>

15
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:39.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

16
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.050
<v Speaker 1>those foam core sheets about eight inches high and it made the thing in quarters</v>

17
00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.890
<v Speaker 1>and so that it would fit together on the wall because it would have been too big</v>

18
00:00:47.891 --> 00:00:48.850
<v Speaker 1>to maneuver easily.</v>

19
00:00:48.851 --> 00:00:49.370
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

20
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.110
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

21
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.550
<v Speaker 1>it's a very complicated,</v>

22
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.210
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

23
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.870
<v Speaker 1>image.</v>

24
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.850
<v Speaker 1>It's actually a three dimensional representation of a,</v>

25
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.980
<v Speaker 1>it's a three dimensional representation of a two dimensional representation of a</v>

26
00:01:05.981 --> 00:01:07.360
<v Speaker 1>four dimensional object.</v>

27
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.950
<v Speaker 1>And that four dimensional object you could think of as</v>

28
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.290
<v Speaker 1>it's a representation of time and space.</v>

29
00:01:14.291 --> 00:01:15.490
<v Speaker 1>And I can tell you,</v>

30
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.670
<v Speaker 1>I kind of have to hint at what the painting means.</v>

31
00:01:18.671 --> 00:01:20.020
<v Speaker 1>It or the sculpture,</v>

32
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.890
<v Speaker 1>it means the same thing that music means to know how music unfolds and then</v>

33
00:01:23.891 --> 00:01:26.050
<v Speaker 1>something else unfolds within it.</v>

34
00:01:26.051 --> 00:01:27.550
<v Speaker 1>And then it unfolds again within it,</v>

35
00:01:27.551 --> 00:01:29.110
<v Speaker 1>like a rose opening into the,</v>

36
00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.530
<v Speaker 1>into the day or like a lotus flower that sort of comes up from the darkest steps</v>

37
00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.750
<v Speaker 1>up through the dark water and then blooms on the,</v>

38
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.030
<v Speaker 1>on the surface of the water and the sun.</v>

39
00:01:40.031 --> 00:01:41.140
<v Speaker 1>And that's where the Buddha,</v>

40
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:42.430
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

42
00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:43.061
<v Speaker 1>what would you say?</v>

43
00:01:43.061 --> 00:01:44.560
<v Speaker 1>Symbol symbolically rest.</v>

44
00:01:44.561 --> 00:01:47.530
<v Speaker 1>So can imagine that thing opening and then imagine that that's what that</v>

45
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:48.880
<v Speaker 1>painting is an image of.</v>

46
00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.230
<v Speaker 1>And that's the same thing as music.</v>

47
00:01:50.231 --> 00:01:52.180
<v Speaker 1>So it's a Mandela image.</v>

48
00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.231
<v Speaker 1>And for young,</v>

49
00:01:53.231 --> 00:01:57.310
<v Speaker 1>the Mandela was a symbol of the self and the self was something that unfolds</v>

50
00:01:57.311 --> 00:01:58.091
<v Speaker 1>like music,</v>

51
00:01:58.091 --> 00:02:01.060
<v Speaker 1>which is actually why we like music and it's like the,</v>

52
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.290
<v Speaker 1>the rose,</v>

53
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.210
<v Speaker 1>the rose that you see that the geometric rose that you see in stained glass,</v>

54
00:02:07.211 --> 00:02:08.044
<v Speaker 1>it's the same thing.</v>

55
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:08.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

56
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.670
<v Speaker 1>that's the Stain Glass Window that Pinocchio was reprehensible.</v>

57
00:02:12.671 --> 00:02:13.540
<v Speaker 1>Compatriot.</v>

58
00:02:13.541 --> 00:02:13.900
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

59
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:14.501
<v Speaker 1>what's his name?</v>

60
00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:14.831
<v Speaker 1>Lamp.</v>

61
00:02:14.831 --> 00:02:18.520
<v Speaker 1>Wick breaks when he's in pleasure island that he throws a rock to destroy the</v>

62
00:02:18.521 --> 00:02:22.790
<v Speaker 1>model home to demolish the substructure of Western civilization.</v>

63
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.120
<v Speaker 1>So I had a very intense religious experience at one point when I was</v>

64
00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:29.410
<v Speaker 1>contemplating that.</v>

65
00:02:29.411 --> 00:02:31.390
<v Speaker 1>So when I drew the image to begin with,</v>

66
00:02:31.391 --> 00:02:32.740
<v Speaker 1>I drew it in about 10 minutes,</v>

67
00:02:32.741 --> 00:02:33.400
<v Speaker 1>kind of rough.</v>

68
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.890
<v Speaker 1>And then I use a straight edge to straighten it all open and a protractor to or</v>

69
00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:39.520
<v Speaker 1>a compass to make the curves.</v>

70
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.800
<v Speaker 1>But I drew it very quickly and I'd been thinking about,</v>

71
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.930
<v Speaker 1>I've been reading young a lot at that point,</v>

72
00:02:43.931 --> 00:02:45.160
<v Speaker 1>like fruit for months,</v>

73
00:02:45.161 --> 00:02:46.390
<v Speaker 1>months of intense reading.</v>

74
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.630
<v Speaker 1>And that image you sort of popped out of me very,</v>

75
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:50.200
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

76
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.040
<v Speaker 1>very suddenly.</v>

77
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.590
<v Speaker 1>But it took about three months to make the actual image.</v>

78
00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.030
<v Speaker 1>And then I had only a quarter of it hanging on my wall because it was so big.</v>

79
00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.880
<v Speaker 1>And I had finished it after about three months of work.</v>

80
00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:04.600
<v Speaker 1>So this was back in 1985 and it was a graduate student and I was listening to</v>

81
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:05.620
<v Speaker 1>the Jupiter symphony,</v>

82
00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:07.500
<v Speaker 1>which is the piece of music that I use,</v>

83
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:08.530
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

84
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.150
<v Speaker 1>that was used for the intro to my,</v>

85
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.050
<v Speaker 1>to my videos.</v>

86
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.730
<v Speaker 1>And it's a Mozart symphony.</v>

87
00:03:12.731 --> 00:03:13.840
<v Speaker 1>And this happened,</v>

88
00:03:13.841 --> 00:03:14.410
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

89
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:15.250
<v Speaker 1>So this happened.</v>

90
00:03:15.251 --> 00:03:19.590
<v Speaker 1>So I was really watching that Mandela,</v>

91
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.141
<v Speaker 1>that quarter,</v>

92
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:20.681
<v Speaker 1>Mandela,</v>

93
00:03:20.681 --> 00:03:23.890
<v Speaker 1>that I have made intensely and quite listening to the music,</v>

94
00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:26.950
<v Speaker 1>trying to understand what the music music was signifying,</v>

95
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:27.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

96
00:03:27.251 --> 00:03:29.650
<v Speaker 1>because music has intrinsic meaning,</v>

97
00:03:29.651 --> 00:03:30.880
<v Speaker 1>which is a very strange thing.</v>

98
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.650
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

99
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.280
<v Speaker 1>the part of the reason for that is that language has meaning and our language</v>

100
00:03:36.281 --> 00:03:37.720
<v Speaker 1>has a musical quality,</v>

101
00:03:37.721 --> 00:03:38.080
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

102
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.380
<v Speaker 1>And that's process most of by the right hemisphere so that when people speak,</v>

103
00:03:41.381 --> 00:03:42.010
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

104
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.140
<v Speaker 1>there's a melody in their language.</v>

105
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.600
<v Speaker 1>And that carries a lot of the emotional import.</v>

106
00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:49.870
<v Speaker 1>And then what musicians have done is figured out how to use that,</v>

107
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:50.320
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

108
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.153
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

109
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.930
<v Speaker 1>that musical faculty,</v>

110
00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:57.931
<v Speaker 1>let's call it that no one's semantic w musical faculty to sort of purely denote</v>

111
00:03:58.451 --> 00:03:58.900
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>

112
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.310
<v Speaker 1>That's part of what music means.</v>

113
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.270
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

114
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.060
<v Speaker 1>but I was still trying to understand what the meaning was.</v>

115
00:04:04.061 --> 00:04:04.894
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>

116
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.580
<v Speaker 1>because it's nonverbal,</v>

117
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:07.930
<v Speaker 1>the meaning of music.</v>

118
00:04:07.931 --> 00:04:09.700
<v Speaker 1>And I was trying to figure out how to articulate that.</v>

119
00:04:09.701 --> 00:04:11.370
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly why I made the,</v>

120
00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.250
<v Speaker 1>the sculpture was to get a grip on it and to understand it in anyways,</v>

121
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:16.130
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

122
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.963
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

123
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:17.711
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

124
00:04:17.711 --> 00:04:19.060
<v Speaker 1>really concentrating hard on that.</v>

125
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.893
<v Speaker 1>Mandela and,</v>

126
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:21.310
<v Speaker 1>and that sculpture.</v>

127
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.160
<v Speaker 1>And I had been working on it intensely for about three months.</v>

128
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.040
<v Speaker 1>And also that's a lot of meditation on a single idea.</v>

129
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.500
<v Speaker 1>And I was standing in my living room and then had this very strange experience.</v>

130
00:04:31.501 --> 00:04:32.334
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

131
00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.190
<v Speaker 1>and I can't explain this properly because there's no way of really describing</v>

132
00:04:36.191 --> 00:04:36.281
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

133
00:04:36.281 --> 00:04:37.420
<v Speaker 1>but I'll do my best.</v>

134
00:04:37.421 --> 00:04:38.290
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

135
00:04:38.291 --> 00:04:40.480
<v Speaker 1>when those renaissance painting sometimes you see,</v>

136
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.060
<v Speaker 1>well first of all you see great cloud,</v>

137
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:44.350
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>

138
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.480
<v Speaker 1>great sunny skies with,</v>

139
00:04:46.481 --> 00:04:47.920
<v Speaker 1>with massive,</v>

140
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:48.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

141
00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.350
<v Speaker 1>what stupendous impressive bills of clouds and then light shining through the</v>

142
00:04:53.351 --> 00:04:55.030
<v Speaker 1>sunlight shining through in streams.</v>

143
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.990
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes that's captured very beautifully but especially English later,</v>

144
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.960
<v Speaker 1>later artists usually that or later than the renaissance.</v>

145
00:05:01.961 --> 00:05:03.640
<v Speaker 1>But you see it in renaissance paintings too.</v>

146
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.751
<v Speaker 1>And you all,</v>

147
00:05:04.751 --> 00:05:06.280
<v Speaker 1>you also see in,</v>

148
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.940
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

149
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.110
<v Speaker 1>in renaissance paintings,</v>

150
00:05:08.111 --> 00:05:10.300
<v Speaker 1>especially in the earlier phase of the renaissance,</v>

151
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.600
<v Speaker 1>the sky opening up in God sort of peering fourth through the clouds.</v>

152
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.020
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly what seemed to happen to me is that I had this sense,</v>

153
00:05:17.021 --> 00:05:18.070
<v Speaker 1>it was like a vision,</v>

154
00:05:18.071 --> 00:05:20.170
<v Speaker 1>although I was still in my living room in Newark,</v>

155
00:05:20.171 --> 00:05:21.700
<v Speaker 1>but inside the theater of,</v>

156
00:05:21.701 --> 00:05:22.720
<v Speaker 1>in my imagination,</v>

157
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.190
<v Speaker 1>I could feel the,</v>

158
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.190
<v Speaker 1>the sky opening up now and it wasn't the sky,</v>

159
00:05:27.191 --> 00:05:27.970
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

160
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.980
<v Speaker 1>I would say the only way I can let you think about it,</v>

161
00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.980
<v Speaker 1>that was something like another dimension.</v>

162
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.970
<v Speaker 1>And then I could feel this force descend upon me,</v>

163
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.560
<v Speaker 1>which I think was something that,</v>

164
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

165
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:43.810
<v Speaker 1>would have been considered classically something like the holy ghost,</v>

166
00:05:43.811 --> 00:05:44.644
<v Speaker 1>I suppose.</v>

167
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.740
<v Speaker 1>And it filled me with this intense sense of,</v>

168
00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:48.190
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

169
00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:48.730
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

170
00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:49.300
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

171
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.590
<v Speaker 1>of Paradise,</v>

172
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.260
<v Speaker 1>a paradise.</v>

173
00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:57.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to say it,</v>

174
00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:58.593
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

175
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.050
<v Speaker 1>while it was like being in heaven for some,</v>

176
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.943
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

177
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:07.430
<v Speaker 1>some brief period of time and I could feel myself transformed,</v>

178
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.900
<v Speaker 1>transmuted as a consequence of this experience.</v>

179
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.150
<v Speaker 1>And it was as if I was in the presence of something that was living,</v>

180
00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

181
00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:18.830
<v Speaker 1>and I suppose that was an experience of God if you want to put it that way.</v>

182
00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:20.123
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

183
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.440
<v Speaker 1>that's certainly what it seemed like.</v>

184
00:06:21.441 --> 00:06:21.600
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

185
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.360
<v Speaker 1>and I felt that I could live that way.</v>

186
00:06:23.361 --> 00:06:27.200
<v Speaker 1>I could live transfigured like that permanently if I desired it.</v>

187
00:06:27.201 --> 00:06:27.950
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

188
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:28.401
<v Speaker 1>my God,</v>

189
00:06:28.401 --> 00:06:31.910
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be able to walk down the street in this sort of elevated state,</v>

190
00:06:31.911 --> 00:06:32.744
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

191
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how I would act.</v>

192
00:06:34.551 --> 00:06:35.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how he would interact with people.</v>

193
00:06:35.961 --> 00:06:37.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how people would interact with me.</v>

194
00:06:37.671 --> 00:06:39.410
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think that I could do it.</v>

195
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:42.500
<v Speaker 1>And then I felt that whatever had descended,</v>

196
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.000
<v Speaker 1>it seemed that as if it was sorrowful and,</v>

197
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.440
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>

198
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.690
<v Speaker 1>and it departed from me slowly and,</v>

199
00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:48.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

200
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.513
<v Speaker 1>with no,</v>

201
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.860
<v Speaker 1>like with no punitive intent.</v>

202
00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.530
<v Speaker 1>And I wouldn't say with any dissatisfaction,</v>

203
00:06:54.531 --> 00:06:56.420
<v Speaker 1>it was as if the gift had been offered did,</v>

204
00:06:56.421 --> 00:06:58.280
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't in no position to receive.</v>

205
00:06:58.910 --> 00:06:59.301
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

206
00:06:59.301 --> 00:07:00.134
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

207
00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:00.770
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>

208
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:02.330
<v Speaker 1>I talked to my wife soon afterwards.</v>

209
00:07:02.331 --> 00:07:05.600
<v Speaker 1>I shook for about physically for about half an hour after that,</v>

210
00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:06.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

211
00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.041
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

212
00:07:07.041 --> 00:07:07.340
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

213
00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:08.600
<v Speaker 1>like I was shaking,</v>

214
00:07:08.601 --> 00:07:08.901
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

215
00:07:08.901 --> 00:07:09.170
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

216
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:09.530
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

217
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.770
<v Speaker 1>like he shake after a car accident if you've ever been in a car accident.</v>

218
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:17.000
<v Speaker 1>And my pupils were completely dilated and I had a couple of experiences like</v>

219
00:07:17.001 --> 00:07:17.480
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

220
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.760
<v Speaker 1>like echoes of it a couple of times after that.</v>

221
00:07:19.761 --> 00:07:20.390
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

222
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:20.781
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>

223
00:07:20.781 --> 00:07:21.321
<v Speaker 1>that was a very,</v>

224
00:07:21.321 --> 00:07:22.520
<v Speaker 1>very powerful experience.</v>

225
00:07:22.521 --> 00:07:23.960
<v Speaker 1>I've certainly never forgotten that.</v>

226
00:07:23.961 --> 00:07:24.650
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

227
00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:25.460
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

228
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:26.270
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

229
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:26.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

230
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.370
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>

231
00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:28.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to think about that.</v>

232
00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:29.533
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

233
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.150
<v Speaker 1>God only knows what the world is really like,</v>

234
00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:32.841
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

235
00:07:32.841 --> 00:07:36.020
<v Speaker 1>And I've had a variety of very strange experiences that have convinced me that</v>

236
00:07:36.021 --> 00:07:37.520
<v Speaker 1>we know very little about anything.</v>

237
00:07:37.521 --> 00:07:37.820
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
