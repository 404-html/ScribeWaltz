00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.660
<v Speaker 1>What is the evolutionary reason for having consciousness?</v>

2
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.300
<v Speaker 1>I think that was Toby who asked that God only knows.</v>

3
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:16.223
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.970
<v Speaker 1>that's been a problem that people have been hammering on for a long time.</v>

5
00:00:20.971 --> 00:00:21.181
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

6
00:00:21.181 --> 00:00:25.560
<v Speaker 1>that's the so called Zombie problem that David Chalmers is as described,</v>

7
00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:26.640
<v Speaker 1>which is something like,</v>

8
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.190
<v Speaker 1>how do you know that other people aren't exactly like you except acting in a</v>

9
00:00:32.191 --> 00:00:35.110
<v Speaker 1>completely determined matter and devoid of consciousnesses?</v>

10
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:36.603
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

11
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the evolutionary reason is for consciousness.</v>

12
00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:40.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

13
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.110
<v Speaker 1>I can speculate like what consciousness seems to be,</v>

14
00:00:43.111 --> 00:00:44.190
<v Speaker 1>at least in part,</v>

15
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:45.713
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

16
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

17
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.750
<v Speaker 1>a mechanism of repair.</v>

18
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.040
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of the things that you do are unconscious.</v>

19
00:00:53.041 --> 00:00:53.281
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

20
00:00:53.281 --> 00:00:54.360
<v Speaker 1>like when you're driving,</v>

21
00:00:54.361 --> 00:00:55.620
<v Speaker 1>if you're an expert driver,</v>

22
00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.350
<v Speaker 1>you're using your eyes to watch the road and your eyes are moving your hands and</v>

23
00:01:01.351 --> 00:01:02.184
<v Speaker 1>your arms,</v>

24
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.700
<v Speaker 1>but you're not really thinking about what you're doing.</v>

25
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.330
<v Speaker 1>You're not attending to it consciously because you've built circuitry already</v>

26
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.150
<v Speaker 1>specialized circuitry that handles all those tasks.</v>

27
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.661
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

28
00:01:12.661 --> 00:01:14.820
<v Speaker 1>what happens when you're driving?</v>

29
00:01:14.821 --> 00:01:16.440
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that you make a mistake.</v>

30
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.830
<v Speaker 1>Well then what happens is you consciously attend to the mistake and you attempt</v>

31
00:01:22.141 --> 00:01:26.130
<v Speaker 1>to revise the part of the automatic structure that produced the error.</v>

32
00:01:26.131 --> 00:01:27.480
<v Speaker 1>So imagine this,</v>

33
00:01:27.481 --> 00:01:30.810
<v Speaker 1>imagine you're playing the piano and you're playing a very complicated,</v>

34
00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.190
<v Speaker 1>sequence and you stumble over part of it.</v>

36
00:01:35.191 --> 00:01:38.520
<v Speaker 1>So you're zooming along and you stumble over part of it and then you attend to</v>

37
00:01:38.521 --> 00:01:43.521
<v Speaker 1>that and you'd go back and you slow down and you move your fingers slowly and</v>

38
00:01:43.711 --> 00:01:48.240
<v Speaker 1>you try to reprogram those little automatic units that have handled that part of</v>

39
00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:48.600
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

40
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.040
<v Speaker 1>You repair them and reprogram them and you get faster and faster out it as they</v>

41
00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:54.390
<v Speaker 1>automatize and then you go.</v>

42
00:01:54.391 --> 00:01:59.391
<v Speaker 1>So consciousness seems to be something that watches what you do automatically,</v>

43
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.890
<v Speaker 1>checks for errors and then repairs it.</v>

44
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.540
<v Speaker 1>And so that's its function.</v>

45
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.880
<v Speaker 1>Now you might ask why a repair mechanism like that would have to be associated</v>

46
00:02:08.881 --> 00:02:10.910
<v Speaker 1>with awareness and answered.</v>

47
00:02:10.911 --> 00:02:11.610
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>

48
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

49
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.170
<v Speaker 1>not only do I not know,</v>

50
00:02:13.171 --> 00:02:17.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anyone knows if I was speculating and which I've done.</v>

51
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.900
<v Speaker 1>I think consciousness actually plays an integral role in being itself,</v>

52
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.820
<v Speaker 1>because I'm not convinced that there would be any being of any recognizable sort</v>

53
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.890
<v Speaker 1>without a conscious observer.</v>

54
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.560
<v Speaker 1>So I think consciousness is actually like a center point of,</v>

55
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.490
<v Speaker 1>of the cosmos in some sense.</v>

56
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.950
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's because of ideas like that,</v>

57
00:02:37.951 --> 00:02:39.090
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>

58
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.860
<v Speaker 1>the grand archetypal idea of the soul has emerged and I think it's correct.</v>

59
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:44.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

60
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.203
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

61
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.920
<v Speaker 1>but how to precisely integrate that with evolutionary theory,</v>

62
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:51.030
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

63
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.960
<v Speaker 1>apart from the description that already provided,</v>

64
00:02:54.961 --> 00:02:55.620
<v Speaker 1>I just don't,</v>

65
00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.610
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know.</v>
