1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:00.973
<v Speaker 1>Hmm,</v>

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.630
<v Speaker 1>so</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a fun one.</v>

3
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.800
<v Speaker 1>This is from the ead wind salter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ninth to twelfth century.</v>

4
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.230
<v Speaker 1>That's how Adam and eve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the.</v>

5
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.040
<v Speaker 1>There is speculation that the fruit that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're eating there,</v>

6
00:00:22.041 --> 00:00:25.970
<v Speaker 1>you see this psilocybin mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

7
00:00:25.971 --> 00:00:28.340
<v Speaker 1>Because they're the only kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>mushroom that girl like that.</v>

8
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.360
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty wild you might say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then this is the,</v>

9
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.640
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called [inaudible] steria</v>
<v Speaker 1>vine if I remember correctly,</v>

10
00:00:37.641 --> 00:00:41.210
<v Speaker 1>and it's what Iowasca is made out of and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has this double helix form which is</v>

11
00:00:41.211 --> 00:00:43.040
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very interesting.</v>

12
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:44.810
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that natives,</v>

13
00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:48.080
<v Speaker 1>nobody could figure out how the hell</v>
<v Speaker 1>they made this Iowasca which,</v>

14
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.560
<v Speaker 1>which transports people spiritually in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very intense manner.</v>

15
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.300
<v Speaker 1>And there's a whole religion based on</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

16
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.060
<v Speaker 1>like a modern religion as well as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>archaic religion to to,</v>

17
00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.660
<v Speaker 1>to make this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had to take two plants that don't</v>

18
00:00:59.661 --> 00:01:03.620
<v Speaker 1>grow anywhere near each other and like</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like a million plants in the</v>

19
00:01:03.621 --> 00:01:04.160
<v Speaker 1>Amazon.</v>

20
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.350
<v Speaker 1>So like how do you figure that out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knows.</v>

21
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.070
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to cook them in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>very particular way for a particular</v>

22
00:01:10.071 --> 00:01:12.710
<v Speaker 1>amount of time before you produce this</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

23
00:01:12.711 --> 00:01:16.160
<v Speaker 1>So one of the plants has dmt in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a very intense psychedelic,</v>

24
00:01:16.161 --> 00:01:20.540
<v Speaker 1>but it's very short acting and the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a Mao inhibitor.</v>

25
00:01:20.541 --> 00:01:23.360
<v Speaker 1>So if you take the DMT and you take the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mao inhibitor,</v>

26
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.860
<v Speaker 1>then the DMT trip lasts for much longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what these Amazonian</v>

27
00:01:27.861 --> 00:01:31.550
<v Speaker 1>natives figured out and no one has any</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea how they managed it and if you ask</v>

28
00:01:31.551 --> 00:01:33.290
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tell you that the plants told them</v>

29
00:01:33.291 --> 00:01:35.900
<v Speaker 1>how to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which isn't much of an explanation as</v>

30
00:01:35.901 --> 00:01:39.620
<v Speaker 1>far as modern people are concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then when modern people take the</v>

31
00:01:39.621 --> 00:01:42.680
<v Speaker 1>IOWASCA and the plant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

32
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.830
<v Speaker 1>starts to talk to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're a little less leery of the whole</v>

33
00:01:45.831 --> 00:01:48.140
<v Speaker 1>theory that the plants had something to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do with this.</v>

34
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.560
<v Speaker 1>So you know when these things that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These.</v>

35
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm loath to talk about this because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>not an advocate for drug use,</v>

36
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.520
<v Speaker 1>but by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't ignore empirical data.</v>

37
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.600
<v Speaker 1>It's not reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the empirical data that psychedelic</v>

38
00:02:02.601 --> 00:02:06.050
<v Speaker 1>substances can produce mystical</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences and that those often have a</v>

39
00:02:06.051 --> 00:02:07.400
<v Speaker 1>transformative effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

40
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.270
<v Speaker 1>one of the latest study showed that if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you took people who were dying of cancer</v>

41
00:02:11.271 --> 00:02:15.350
<v Speaker 1>and you and you gave them silicide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>been in a sufficient dose to produce a</v>

42
00:02:15.351 --> 00:02:19.490
<v Speaker 1>mystical experience that you radically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It decreased their fear of death.</v>

43
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like you gotta think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

44
00:02:23.361 --> 00:02:25.460
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's tough.</v>

45
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.530
<v Speaker 1>That's a tough experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just wouldn't expect that,</v>

46
00:02:28.531 --> 00:02:33.410
<v Speaker 1>that you think you take someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do range them intensely and then</v>

47
00:02:33.411 --> 00:02:35.480
<v Speaker 1>when they come back they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though they're dying,</v>

48
00:02:35.481 --> 00:02:37.850
<v Speaker 1>they're not nearly as afraid of dying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:02:37.851 --> 00:02:39.770
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to kind of wake up and smell the</v>

50
00:02:39.771 --> 00:02:41.270
<v Speaker 1>roses when you see something like that.</v>

51
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.360
<v Speaker 1>And the people who are doing this</v>
<v Speaker 1>research are very reliable people.</v>

52
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.070
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the Amanita Mascara,</v>

53
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this old idea.</v>

54
00:02:50.181 --> 00:02:53.930
<v Speaker 1>It's quite a funny idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Toadstools so flies like avenue to</v>

55
00:02:53.931 --> 00:02:57.590
<v Speaker 1>Mascara and there's some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is ridiculous.</v>

56
00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.850
<v Speaker 1>There's some evidence that they actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>like getting stoned.</v>

57
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.930
<v Speaker 1>So because animals will eat these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like reindeer will eat these things too.</v>

58
00:03:04.931 --> 00:03:08.980
<v Speaker 1>And they get pretty tripped out by them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I have this book on psychedelic</v>

59
00:03:08.981 --> 00:03:11.380
<v Speaker 1>use among animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a small book,</v>

60
00:03:11.381 --> 00:03:12.880
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

61
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.290
<v Speaker 1>so there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this idea that toads used to sit</v>

62
00:03:17.291 --> 00:03:22.270
<v Speaker 1>around the haven't eaten miscarry and</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait for the stone flies to like buzz</v>

63
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.440
<v Speaker 1>badly around them and then snap them up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty funny I think.</v>

64
00:03:26.441 --> 00:03:29.350
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

65
00:03:29.351 --> 00:03:32.350
<v Speaker 1>there are mushrooms in the US that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>the oldest,</v>

66
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.960
<v Speaker 1>the oldest organisms on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

67
00:03:34.961 --> 00:03:37.030
<v Speaker 1>there's one mushroom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember where it is,</v>

68
00:03:37.031 --> 00:03:39.520
<v Speaker 1>but it covers something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

69
00:03:39.521 --> 00:03:42.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like square hundreds of square miles.</v>

70
00:03:42.011 --> 00:03:44.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like this huge thing because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>all underground,</v>

71
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they have these very complex</v>

72
00:03:46.421 --> 00:03:50.410
<v Speaker 1>networks of mycelium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're called and they think the thing</v>

73
00:03:50.411 --> 00:03:53.170
<v Speaker 1>is like 150,000 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

74
00:03:53.171 --> 00:03:56.710
<v Speaker 1>So there's plenty of things about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world that we don't know,</v>

75
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.060
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
