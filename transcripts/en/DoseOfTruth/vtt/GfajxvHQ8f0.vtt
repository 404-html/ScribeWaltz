00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.640
<v Speaker 1>Please welcome to the stage.</v>

2
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:14.270
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

3
00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.920
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

4
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.980
<v Speaker 1>was just thinking about stage,</v>

5
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.710
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out what I'm going to dive into because I use these folks as an</v>

6
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.090
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to the more deeply into what I've been thinking about.</v>

7
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to talk to you about,</v>

8
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.341
<v Speaker 1>we spoke,</v>

9
00:01:32.341 --> 00:01:33.960
<v Speaker 1>I wrote 12 rules for life.</v>

10
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:35.390
<v Speaker 1>Let me say it,</v>

11
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.220
<v Speaker 1>but I don't,</v>

12
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm not parroting the books.</v>

13
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.750
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

14
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to make what I'm thinking about clearer.</v>

15
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.120
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking maybe a little story before it can for the talk,</v>

16
00:01:48.121 --> 00:01:50.680
<v Speaker 1>but what exactly is it that we're going to address and I thought,</v>

17
00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.310
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

18
00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to interest with relationship between perception,</v>

19
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:54.743
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

20
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.100
<v Speaker 1>I thought that's a very serious problem and it's so funny with the city at the</v>

21
00:01:59.101 --> 00:02:01.620
<v Speaker 1>back of the stage and think back to them.</v>

22
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.430
<v Speaker 1>12 here,</v>

23
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.870
<v Speaker 1>welcome.</v>

24
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.870
<v Speaker 1>Like go and see [inaudible] listen to be carved for 70 minutes about,</v>

25
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.220
<v Speaker 1>it's a philosophical discussion,</v>

26
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.000
<v Speaker 1>really psychological discussion as well.</v>

27
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.610
<v Speaker 1>The relationship between perception and reality of who would have thought that</v>

28
00:02:20.611 --> 00:02:22.200
<v Speaker 1>would be like a popular thing,</v>

29
00:02:22.201 --> 00:02:22.830
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

30
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:23.330
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

31
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.370
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's a thing.</v>

32
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.480
<v Speaker 1>It's screening something.</v>

33
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:26.663
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

34
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.940
<v Speaker 1>Well reserve obviously a hunger that's the unmet for some reason for serious his</v>

35
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.290
<v Speaker 1>and that's great.</v>

36
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.500
<v Speaker 1>So that's what we're going to do.</v>

37
00:02:38.501 --> 00:02:40.470
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have some written give tonight.</v>

38
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:41.820
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

39
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to stumble around with a bit tonight.</v>

40
00:02:45.961 --> 00:02:49.350
<v Speaker 1>I think because this is a very difficult topic that I have gotten completely</v>

41
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.220
<v Speaker 1>clear in my head.</v>

42
00:02:50.221 --> 00:02:50.730
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

43
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

44
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.400
<v Speaker 1>hope you have to make this as coherent as possible.</v>

45
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.380
<v Speaker 1>See if what I'm going to be trying to solve at least to some degree is the</v>

46
00:02:59.951 --> 00:03:00.460
<v Speaker 1>problem</v>

47
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.840
<v Speaker 2>of the relationship between value and reality.</v>

48
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.190
<v Speaker 2>We live in a world of value where things have gotten that material reality</v>

49
00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:11.950
<v Speaker 2>itself cause the teeth to have any intrinsic value,</v>

50
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.461
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

51
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:13.294
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of,</v>

52
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.330
<v Speaker 2>it's there and so objective and in some sense whatever value there is we</v>

53
00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:21.550
<v Speaker 2>attribute to the world.</v>

54
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.620
<v Speaker 2>That's one way of looking at it anyways.</v>

55
00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.440
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>

56
00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

57
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.550
<v Speaker 2>that that opens up questions about the reality of value.</v>

58
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.991
<v Speaker 2>It also,</v>

59
00:03:31.991 --> 00:03:33.340
<v Speaker 2>so that's one thing I want to address.</v>

60
00:03:33.341 --> 00:03:36.160
<v Speaker 2>The problem I want to address is how it is.</v>

61
00:03:36.161 --> 00:03:41.161
<v Speaker 2>The perception is even possible because the world is an insanely complicated</v>

62
00:03:41.591 --> 00:03:42.280
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

63
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.040
<v Speaker 2>Like it's so complicated that it's really,</v>

64
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.180
<v Speaker 2>it's really beyond comprehension and so it is going is how it is to,</v>

65
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.450
<v Speaker 2>you can comprehend until that you could perceive it because it's actually</v>

66
00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:53.293
<v Speaker 2>beyond,</v>

67
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.131
<v Speaker 2>it's so complex.</v>

68
00:03:54.131 --> 00:03:56.630
<v Speaker 2>It's beyond your ability to proceed.</v>

69
00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:57.400
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

70
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.150
<v Speaker 2>so I'm trying to solve two problems at the same time is how in the world do you</v>

71
00:04:01.151 --> 00:04:06.151
<v Speaker 2>manage this incredibly difficult job of perception and what role does value that</v>

72
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:08.830
<v Speaker 2>the idea of value,</v>

73
00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:11.560
<v Speaker 2>the idea that one thing is worth more than another,</v>

74
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.540
<v Speaker 2>what role does that play in that?</v>

75
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.051
<v Speaker 2>You might say,</v>

76
00:04:14.051 --> 00:04:15.590
<v Speaker 2>well why is that so relevant?</v>

77
00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.870
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

78
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:16.120
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

79
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.660
<v Speaker 2>it's exactly relevant because if the problems,</v>

80
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:19.810
<v Speaker 2>problem relevance,</v>

81
00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.670
<v Speaker 2>you have to assume that one thing is more important than another before you can</v>

82
00:04:24.671 --> 00:04:25.360
<v Speaker 2>do anything.</v>

83
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.360
<v Speaker 2>Because to do something means that you privileged that thing above all the other</v>

84
00:04:30.701 --> 00:04:31.810
<v Speaker 2>things that you could be doing,</v>

85
00:04:31.811 --> 00:04:32.740
<v Speaker 2>you value anymore.</v>

86
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.730
<v Speaker 2>So without imposing a value structure on the world are discovering one within</v>

87
00:04:36.731 --> 00:04:37.564
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

88
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't know which of those is true.</v>

89
00:04:39.191 --> 00:04:41.150
<v Speaker 2>You can't eat an act if you have to add,</v>

90
00:04:41.151 --> 00:04:42.530
<v Speaker 2>so you're stuck with it,</v>

91
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.650
<v Speaker 2>stuck with them.</v>

92
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:46.960
<v Speaker 2>It's not poured so much.</v>

93
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.150
<v Speaker 2>You start with the problem of value.</v>

94
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.351
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

95
00:04:50.351 --> 00:04:53.530
<v Speaker 2>so we're going to walk through them and see if like I'm tangled up.</v>

96
00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.280
<v Speaker 2>And there's,</v>

97
00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.420
<v Speaker 2>I guess the third issue too,</v>

98
00:04:55.421 --> 00:04:59.920
<v Speaker 2>we just given that you have to value things in order to,</v>

99
00:04:59.921 --> 00:05:04.921
<v Speaker 2>after that you have to act in what should you fail you and so,</v>

100
00:05:05.051 --> 00:05:07.330
<v Speaker 2>and how is that related to tell you should perceive the world.</v>

101
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.601
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

102
00:05:07.601 --> 00:05:08.920
<v Speaker 2>so that's the kind of press,</v>

103
00:05:08.921 --> 00:05:10.060
<v Speaker 2>the problem space,</v>

104
00:05:10.061 --> 00:05:12.120
<v Speaker 2>let's say that we're going to investigate,</v>

105
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:17.080
<v Speaker 2>and this is related to chapter 10 which is beat precise in your speech was just</v>

106
00:05:17.081 --> 00:05:20.380
<v Speaker 2>an attempt in 12 rules for life to lay some of this out.</v>

107
00:05:20.381 --> 00:05:23.890
<v Speaker 2>So the first thing I want to point out is,</v>

108
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.670
<v Speaker 2>is some peculiarities of Oak.</v>

109
00:05:25.671 --> 00:05:26.920
<v Speaker 2>We perceive the world.</v>

110
00:05:26.921 --> 00:05:30.490
<v Speaker 2>So we can tell the story first about famous psychological experiment that was</v>

111
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:31.990
<v Speaker 2>run by Dan Simon.</v>

112
00:05:31.991 --> 00:05:33.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go through it pretty quickly.</v>

113
00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.810
<v Speaker 2>It's an experiment that has to do with a phenomenal that Simon called changed</v>

114
00:05:37.811 --> 00:05:38.440
<v Speaker 2>blindness.</v>

115
00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he invented the term.</v>

116
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.690
<v Speaker 2>I think it's supervised but doesn't have it for our purposes or what Simon did.</v>

117
00:05:43.691 --> 00:05:45.260
<v Speaker 2>He made this vision and most of you have seen it.</v>

118
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.113
<v Speaker 2>I'd take,</v>

119
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:51.230
<v Speaker 2>he put six people in front of an elevator in a psychology lab and uh,</v>

120
00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.390
<v Speaker 2>he had three of them dressed in black,</v>

121
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.890
<v Speaker 2>300 dressed in wiping the black team,</v>

122
00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:57.850
<v Speaker 2>Heather basketball.</v>

123
00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:02.840
<v Speaker 2>And the white team had a basketball and the way team was sort of dance around</v>

124
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.970
<v Speaker 2>and passing the basketball back and forth.</v>

125
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.100
<v Speaker 2>So it was black team.</v>

126
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.140
<v Speaker 2>They had their own basketball and your job was coming to fill out,</v>

127
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:09.680
<v Speaker 2>sit down,</v>

128
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.513
<v Speaker 2>watch the video,</v>

129
00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:13.370
<v Speaker 2>count the number of times with the white teeth through the basketball,</v>

130
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:14.320
<v Speaker 2>back and forth.</v>

131
00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.310
<v Speaker 2>Now it's all you have to do now.</v>

132
00:06:16.311 --> 00:06:16.980
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>

133
00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:20.120
<v Speaker 2>you go to magic committed your state of mind.</v>

134
00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:20.811
<v Speaker 2>You do that.</v>

135
00:06:20.811 --> 00:06:22.610
<v Speaker 2>So you've come to the lab,</v>

136
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:24.920
<v Speaker 2>you've come to participate in the scientific experiment,</v>

137
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.870
<v Speaker 2>you've come to following instructions,</v>

138
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.740
<v Speaker 2>and you've come at least in principle to demonstrate that you're capable of</v>

139
00:06:30.741 --> 00:06:31.850
<v Speaker 2>doing all those things.</v>

140
00:06:31.851 --> 00:06:32.270
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

141
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.840
<v Speaker 2>I'd be somewhat intimidating to come into the lab like that.</v>

142
00:06:34.841 --> 00:06:38.000
<v Speaker 2>And you want to do a good job and maybe you want to do a good job because we</v>

143
00:06:38.001 --> 00:06:39.290
<v Speaker 2>want to be a competent person.</v>

144
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.660
<v Speaker 2>And the reason I'm telling them all that it's because you've got to think about</v>

145
00:06:41.661 --> 00:06:44.750
<v Speaker 2>why you would follow the instructions and you do.</v>

146
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:45.171
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

147
00:06:45.171 --> 00:06:48.800
<v Speaker 2>Because it turns out that the fact that you follow the instructions is very,</v>

148
00:06:48.801 --> 00:06:51.230
<v Speaker 2>very important in this particular demonstration.</v>

149
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:54.800
<v Speaker 2>So you sit down in a video unfolds trying to do,</v>

150
00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.770
<v Speaker 2>the people in the any org are quite large,</v>

151
00:06:57.771 --> 00:07:01.100
<v Speaker 2>like they still the whole street so they're not way off in the distance.</v>

152
00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:02.900
<v Speaker 2>That's important because what happens,</v>

153
00:07:02.901 --> 00:07:07.300
<v Speaker 2>it's so Simon starts the video room rents for about three minutes and the white</v>

154
00:07:07.301 --> 00:07:12.301
<v Speaker 2>team is wound around folks in the basketball and throwing it back and forth and</v>

155
00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.650
<v Speaker 2>you're watching them and you're competent.</v>

156
00:07:15.651 --> 00:07:15.950
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

157
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:16.760
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

158
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:17.121
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>

159
00:07:17.121 --> 00:07:17.980
<v Speaker 2>four and safety.</v>

160
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:20.490
<v Speaker 2>You're doing a fine job and he'll turn into doing a fine job.</v>

161
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.960
<v Speaker 2>You run up the whole three minutes and have the extra vendor says,</v>

162
00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:27.970
<v Speaker 2>how many times did the way teams are the basketball back and forth.</v>

163
00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.310
<v Speaker 2>You say 16 and he says,</v>

164
00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:31.851
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>

165
00:07:31.851 --> 00:07:34.010
<v Speaker 2>And he was thinking he great day stuff now.</v>

166
00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:34.610
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

167
00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:35.181
<v Speaker 2>and then he says,</v>

168
00:07:35.181 --> 00:07:35.331
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

169
00:07:35.331 --> 00:07:39.050
<v Speaker 2>can you see anything peculiar when you say</v>

170
00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:41.091
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

171
00:07:41.091 --> 00:07:42.440
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean peculiar?</v>

172
00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:43.640
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

173
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:43.791
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

174
00:07:43.791 --> 00:07:45.260
<v Speaker 2>did you see the gorilla?</v>

175
00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:46.881
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

176
00:07:46.881 --> 00:07:47.290
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

177
00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:48.680
<v Speaker 2>and you say,</v>

178
00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:49.603
<v Speaker 2>well what do you mean?</v>

179
00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:51.350
<v Speaker 2>Did I see the gorilla?</v>

180
00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:52.820
<v Speaker 2>There was no gorilla.</v>

181
00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:54.050
<v Speaker 2>And so Simon says,</v>

182
00:07:54.051 --> 00:07:54.381
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

183
00:07:54.381 --> 00:07:55.820
<v Speaker 2>watch the video again,</v>

184
00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:57.170
<v Speaker 2>this type don't count.</v>

185
00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:01.990
<v Speaker 2>Sort of rewinds it plays it like a minute into the video.</v>

186
00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:02.863
<v Speaker 2>Three minute video.</v>

187
00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.750
<v Speaker 2>This guy comes in front of the left of the screen,</v>

188
00:08:05.751 --> 00:08:06.830
<v Speaker 2>he's like six foot four.</v>

189
00:08:06.831 --> 00:08:07.361
<v Speaker 2>He has a girl,</v>

190
00:08:07.361 --> 00:08:08.194
<v Speaker 2>a signal,</v>

191
00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:10.340
<v Speaker 2>it walks right into the middle of the video,</v>

192
00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:14.720
<v Speaker 2>right in the center and beats his chest for five seconds,</v>

193
00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:15.711
<v Speaker 2>like gorillas,</v>

194
00:08:15.711 --> 00:08:16.950
<v Speaker 2>do these type of things.</v>

195
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:18.830
<v Speaker 2>And then he saw Joe's office.</v>

196
00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:18.971
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

197
00:08:18.971 --> 00:08:19.230
<v Speaker 2>got you.</v>

198
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:20.330
<v Speaker 2>Just as if it's a cross.</v>

199
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:24.200
<v Speaker 2>He was soldiers out of beaches chest quite confidently.</v>

200
00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.210
<v Speaker 2>And then one just off to the side.</v>

201
00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:31.630
<v Speaker 2>And about 60% of the people who watch that video don't see the grill.</v>

202
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:35.800
<v Speaker 2>And so some of you have watched that video and make you so the grill,</v>

203
00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:36.510
<v Speaker 2>maybe you did it.</v>

204
00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:36.630
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

205
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:39.830
<v Speaker 2>that he made a follow up video for all those people who thought they'd learned</v>

206
00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:43.550
<v Speaker 2>their lesson the first time they watched the video in this video.</v>

207
00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:47.870
<v Speaker 2>The same thing happens except when the gorilla comes out.</v>

208
00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:49.760
<v Speaker 2>Now people are crying for that.</v>

209
00:08:49.761 --> 00:08:50.740
<v Speaker 2>Ain't that caps the grill,</v>

210
00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:55.930
<v Speaker 2>the curtains behind changed from red to gold and one of the team players leaves.</v>

211
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:57.770
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

212
00:08:57.770 --> 00:08:58.603
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

213
00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.250
<v Speaker 2>he asks you to start retrieving all smart vote,</v>

214
00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:04.710
<v Speaker 2>whether or not you're sewing things strange when you see the gorilla and he</v>

215
00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:05.491
<v Speaker 2>rewinds it says,</v>

216
00:09:05.491 --> 00:09:05.671
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

217
00:09:05.671 --> 00:09:07.640
<v Speaker 2>but you see the curt and change color.</v>

218
00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:08.940
<v Speaker 2>But the curtain name,</v>

219
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.250
<v Speaker 2>not just the curve,</v>

220
00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:12.780
<v Speaker 2>but that you missed that completely.</v>

221
00:09:12.781 --> 00:09:14.820
<v Speaker 2>And it is the fact that someone left.</v>

222
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:15.750
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

223
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:17.310
<v Speaker 2>so even when you know you're blind,</v>

224
00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:18.300
<v Speaker 2>you're still blind.</v>

225
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.790
<v Speaker 2>And Simon's done stranger things to that.</v>

226
00:09:20.791 --> 00:09:23.070
<v Speaker 2>So one of the experiments he did Harvard,</v>

227
00:09:23.071 --> 00:09:24.150
<v Speaker 2>which is a great experiment,</v>

228
00:09:24.151 --> 00:09:26.100
<v Speaker 2>is to put a camera on top of a building,</v>

229
00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:27.600
<v Speaker 2>is building Hartford Yard,</v>

230
00:09:27.601 --> 00:09:27.901
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

231
00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:28.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

232
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.100
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

233
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.710
<v Speaker 2>the basic central point from the campus.</v>

234
00:09:31.711 --> 00:09:36.600
<v Speaker 2>And there's lots of people out there to have an undergraduate going up to a</v>

235
00:09:36.601 --> 00:09:39.540
<v Speaker 2>tourist for the map and ask for directions.</v>

236
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:40.141
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

237
00:09:40.141 --> 00:09:43.530
<v Speaker 2>so now to undergraduate here,</v>

238
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:44.070
<v Speaker 2>tourists,</v>

239
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:46.770
<v Speaker 2>they're asking directions with the map.</v>

240
00:09:46.771 --> 00:09:47.970
<v Speaker 2>Now over here,</v>

241
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.180
<v Speaker 2>there are two workmen and holding the door like this.</v>

242
00:09:51.181 --> 00:09:52.170
<v Speaker 2>So here's the door.</v>

243
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:53.320
<v Speaker 2>It's can't see the word,</v>

244
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:53.880
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

245
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:54.750
<v Speaker 2>Cause the door covers,</v>

246
00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:56.610
<v Speaker 2>there's one at the front and one at the bat.</v>

247
00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:00.180
<v Speaker 2>And so undergraduate tourist workman,</v>

248
00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:04.830
<v Speaker 2>they walked right in between the tourist and the undergraduate.</v>

249
00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:06.173
<v Speaker 2>And then the undergrounds,</v>

250
00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.500
<v Speaker 2>if he's asking for directions,</v>

251
00:10:07.501 --> 00:10:10.500
<v Speaker 2>grabs the door and keeps on walking.</v>

252
00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.440
<v Speaker 2>And one of the work grabs the map of stands there.</v>

253
00:10:13.441 --> 00:10:16.110
<v Speaker 2>So basically what he's done is swap people.</v>

254
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:21.950
<v Speaker 2>And both 60% of the tourists who were being asked for directions don't notice</v>

255
00:10:22.051 --> 00:10:24.540
<v Speaker 2>that they're now talking to a different person.</v>

256
00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:26.311
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

257
00:10:26.311 --> 00:10:27.750
<v Speaker 2>So well.</v>

258
00:10:27.751 --> 00:10:29.540
<v Speaker 2>So that's how blind you are and you,</v>

259
00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:31.200
<v Speaker 2>you are a staggeringly blind.</v>

260
00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.990
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing that you can make it in the world at all.</v>

261
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:34.681
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

262
00:10:34.681 --> 00:10:38.230
<v Speaker 2>most of what you've seen when you look at the road is actually your memory and</v>

263
00:10:38.231 --> 00:10:38.881
<v Speaker 2>not the world.</v>

264
00:10:38.881 --> 00:10:42.450
<v Speaker 2>Because your brain uses your memory of things to fill in what you don't see it</v>

265
00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.750
<v Speaker 2>as we've already demonstrated because you didn't see the gorilla.</v>

266
00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:47.210
<v Speaker 2>God only knows what you're missing.</v>

267
00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:52.400
<v Speaker 2>And that's the critical issue with regards to that experiment is like who knows</v>

268
00:10:53.761 --> 00:10:54.780
<v Speaker 2>what you're missing.</v>

269
00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:57.030
<v Speaker 2>And the thing that's so crucial,</v>

270
00:10:57.031 --> 00:10:57.331
<v Speaker 2>here's,</v>

271
00:10:57.331 --> 00:10:58.970
<v Speaker 2>here's where value plays into it.</v>

272
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.790
<v Speaker 2>This is why maybe a case of you follow the instructions.</v>

273
00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:03.653
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

274
00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.490
<v Speaker 2>well why didn't you see the gorilla announcer as well?</v>

275
00:11:06.491 --> 00:11:10.110
<v Speaker 2>And you were counting the basketballs and the question is,</v>

276
00:11:10.111 --> 00:11:12.150
<v Speaker 2>well why were you counting the basketballs?</v>

277
00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:15.300
<v Speaker 2>And that's that is cause you were following instructions.</v>

278
00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:16.380
<v Speaker 2>And then the question is,</v>

279
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:16.620
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

280
00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:18.570
<v Speaker 2>why are you following instructions?</v>

281
00:11:18.571 --> 00:11:20.040
<v Speaker 2>Instead of paying attention,</v>

282
00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:21.600
<v Speaker 2>let's say to the gorilla,</v>

283
00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:23.190
<v Speaker 2>which seems more relevant and say,</v>

284
00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:25.440
<v Speaker 2>well why were you following instructions anyways?</v>

285
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:25.920
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

286
00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.080
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to be a good experimental subject.</v>

287
00:11:28.081 --> 00:11:30.630
<v Speaker 2>I guess maybe you're trying not to look stupid,</v>

288
00:11:30.631 --> 00:11:32.130
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to do the DAS property.</v>

289
00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.390
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>

290
00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:36.270
<v Speaker 2>Well maybe you want to demonstrate that you're a competent person.</v>

291
00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:38.910
<v Speaker 2>So like why is that so important to you?</v>

292
00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:40.140
<v Speaker 2>You see,</v>

293
00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:44.280
<v Speaker 2>the reason I'm asking all these questions is because the way that your</v>

294
00:11:44.281 --> 00:11:48.780
<v Speaker 2>perception was structured in that experiment is dependent on all the values that</v>

295
00:11:48.781 --> 00:11:51.590
<v Speaker 2>you brought to the perceptual act and experience.</v>

296
00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:53.290
<v Speaker 2>All of those things work.</v>

297
00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:57.400
<v Speaker 2>Focusing your attention on what it was that you focused on.</v>

298
00:11:57.610 --> 00:11:58.380
<v Speaker 2>And that was the,</v>

299
00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:00.280
<v Speaker 2>the balls and not the gorilla.</v>

300
00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:03.130
<v Speaker 2>And so those are all issues of value.</v>

301
00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:06.190
<v Speaker 2>The only reason that you've come to the ball if it was because you thought that</v>

302
00:12:06.191 --> 00:12:08.530
<v Speaker 2>was the most important thing to do in that circumstance.</v>

303
00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:12.520
<v Speaker 2>So that was what you valued above all else in that circumstance.</v>

304
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:16.960
<v Speaker 2>And so what that shows is that what you value determines what you see.</v>

305
00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:18.880
<v Speaker 2>Now I should say,</v>

306
00:12:18.881 --> 00:12:23.881
<v Speaker 2>I should just stand here and repeat that phrase to you for the next hour and</v>

307
00:12:24.401 --> 00:12:25.234
<v Speaker 2>then leave.</v>

308
00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:26.320
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

309
00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.150
<v Speaker 2>Because that's so,</v>

310
00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:32.150
<v Speaker 2>it's so important that it's so mind boggling that this experiment was a</v>

311
00:12:32.501 --> 00:12:34.990
<v Speaker 2>bombshell in psychology for a whole bunch of reasons,</v>

312
00:12:34.991 --> 00:12:38.650
<v Speaker 2>but it was also a popular bombshell because almost how many of you have seen</v>

313
00:12:38.651 --> 00:12:39.484
<v Speaker 2>that video,</v>

314
00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:40.070
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

315
00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:40.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

316
00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:41.143
<v Speaker 2>It was towards you,</v>

317
00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:41.441
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

318
00:12:41.441 --> 00:12:45.150
<v Speaker 2>It's like how many other psychology experiment videos that you've watched?</v>

319
00:12:45.151 --> 00:12:46.270
<v Speaker 2>Like zero.</v>

320
00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:47.021
<v Speaker 2>This one,</v>

321
00:12:47.021 --> 00:12:50.370
<v Speaker 2>everyone who's watched and now no other questions.</v>

322
00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:52.330
<v Speaker 2>Have you watched the old by anyone ever,</v>

323
00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:55.810
<v Speaker 2>and so that just shows you how I've seen the mind boggling.</v>

324
00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:57.610
<v Speaker 2>This is almost not exactly,</v>

325
00:12:57.890 --> 00:12:58.450
<v Speaker 2>it's not me.</v>

326
00:12:58.450 --> 00:12:59.580
<v Speaker 2>It's so shocking.</v>

327
00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:00.431
<v Speaker 2>It can be the case,</v>

328
00:13:00.431 --> 00:13:05.260
<v Speaker 2>but it's actually even more shocking than just the revelation that you're blind</v>

329
00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:06.320
<v Speaker 2>because that's bad.</v>

330
00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.180
<v Speaker 2>Not because you think,</v>

331
00:13:07.181 --> 00:13:08.470
<v Speaker 2>of course I'd seen the gap grill.</v>

332
00:13:08.471 --> 00:13:08.771
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

333
00:13:08.771 --> 00:13:08.921
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

334
00:13:08.921 --> 00:13:11.800
<v Speaker 2>you go and buy.</v>

335
00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:14.210
<v Speaker 2>But that isn't even a thing that's most my,</v>

336
00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:19.390
<v Speaker 2>but what's most of the most mind boggling in it about it is that it was the best</v>

337
00:13:19.391 --> 00:13:23.430
<v Speaker 2>illustration that psychologist had ever managed about in some sense about the</v>

338
00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.550
<v Speaker 2>structure of perception.</v>

339
00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:30.070
<v Speaker 2>But even more importantly about the fact that your perception is conditioned by</v>

340
00:13:30.071 --> 00:13:31.120
<v Speaker 2>your values.</v>

341
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:35.260
<v Speaker 2>And so we're going to delve into that a little bit because the thing is,</v>

342
00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.390
<v Speaker 2>what are the things you might ask yourself is</v>

343
00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:41.410
<v Speaker 2>if you miss the gorilla,</v>

344
00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:42.760
<v Speaker 2>we also use music.</v>

345
00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:45.160
<v Speaker 2>And then you might ask yourself,</v>

346
00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:45.551
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

347
00:13:45.551 --> 00:13:47.590
<v Speaker 2>are you missing something in your life?</v>

348
00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:48.880
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

349
00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.740
<v Speaker 2>the answer to them is often yes.</v>

350
00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:52.670
<v Speaker 2>And then the question arises,</v>

351
00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:53.523
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

352
00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:55.480
<v Speaker 2>if you're missing something in your life,</v>

353
00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:57.370
<v Speaker 2>maybe you're aiming at the wrong thing.</v>

354
00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:00.100
<v Speaker 2>If you're valuing the wrong thing,</v>

355
00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.320
<v Speaker 2>so you're blind to what you need.</v>

356
00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.820
<v Speaker 2>And the world is very complicated place.</v>

357
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:05.800
<v Speaker 2>There's lots in it.</v>

358
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:08.110
<v Speaker 2>And if you're missing something important,</v>

359
00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.000
<v Speaker 2>it might be because you're not eating,</v>

360
00:14:10.001 --> 00:14:11.240
<v Speaker 2>you'd have the right thing.</v>

361
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:11.680
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

362
00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.170
<v Speaker 2>and it really might be that.</v>

363
00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:15.101
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>

364
00:14:15.101 --> 00:14:15.940
<v Speaker 2>That's what they meant.</v>

365
00:14:15.941 --> 00:14:17.470
<v Speaker 2>So deadly about that experiment.</v>

366
00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:22.680
<v Speaker 2>Now that is the only thing that experiment isn't the only experiments that</v>

367
00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:24.760
<v Speaker 2>experiment that demonstrates this sort of thing.</v>

368
00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:30.210
<v Speaker 2>There's convergent evidence supporting this line of thinking for all sorts of</v>

369
00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:33.340
<v Speaker 2>disparate areas of psychology,</v>

370
00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.020
<v Speaker 2>psychology,</v>

371
00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:34.631
<v Speaker 2>perception.</v>

372
00:14:34.631 --> 00:14:35.450
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

373
00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:36.283
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

374
00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.390
<v Speaker 2>the first other piece of evidence is this.</v>

375
00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:42.730
<v Speaker 2>You have the music,</v>

376
00:14:42.731 --> 00:14:44.380
<v Speaker 2>perceptual resources.</v>

377
00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:47.380
<v Speaker 2>And so especially for vision,</v>

378
00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:48.490
<v Speaker 2>because vision is really,</v>

379
00:14:48.491 --> 00:14:51.160
<v Speaker 2>really narrowly intensive.</v>

380
00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.850
<v Speaker 2>So you mostly,</v>

381
00:14:52.851 --> 00:14:53.720
<v Speaker 2>when you look at the world,</v>

382
00:14:53.721 --> 00:14:55.820
<v Speaker 2>we mostly use the center of your eye.</v>

383
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.570
<v Speaker 2>It's called the fold the on and lets the high resolution part of your eye.</v>

384
00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:03.170
<v Speaker 2>Now you know the difference between a high resolution and a low resolution</v>

385
00:15:03.171 --> 00:15:03.501
<v Speaker 2>image.</v>

386
00:15:03.501 --> 00:15:07.550
<v Speaker 2>A high resolution image has lots of Fiji on a low resolution image has less</v>

387
00:15:07.551 --> 00:15:08.060
<v Speaker 2>detailed.</v>

388
00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:10.140
<v Speaker 2>So if you look straight ahead,</v>

389
00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:10.650
<v Speaker 2>electrify,</v>

390
00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:11.180
<v Speaker 2>look at,</v>

391
00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:15.560
<v Speaker 2>and maybe I'll look at you so I can see your face quite clear.</v>

392
00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:19.130
<v Speaker 2>I know you have a face but I can't see it.</v>

393
00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:19.521
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

394
00:15:19.521 --> 00:15:20.840
<v Speaker 2>you're just a blur.</v>

395
00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:26.120
<v Speaker 2>You I can just see the fact that your face is like your shirt is dark.</v>

396
00:15:26.121 --> 00:15:28.040
<v Speaker 2>I can't see you people at all.</v>

397
00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.150
<v Speaker 2>I know you're there.</v>

398
00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:29.451
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>

399
00:15:29.451 --> 00:15:32.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm not letting my eyes cream tonight really can't see you people at all either.</v>

400
00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:36.080
<v Speaker 2>So my digital space is limited to about that much.</v>

401
00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:36.980
<v Speaker 2>And the part,</v>

402
00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:40.730
<v Speaker 2>the sharp enough to actually see a face is limited to your face.</v>

403
00:15:40.731 --> 00:15:42.590
<v Speaker 2>Cause I can tell you have eyes,</v>

404
00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.060
<v Speaker 2>especially if you move the,</v>

405
00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:47.570
<v Speaker 2>because I'm pretty good at detecting motion in my periphery,</v>

406
00:15:47.571 --> 00:15:49.070
<v Speaker 2>but I can't tell anything else about,</v>

407
00:15:49.071 --> 00:15:50.180
<v Speaker 2>you can't really,</v>

408
00:15:50.181 --> 00:15:51.380
<v Speaker 2>I think your shirts blue,</v>

409
00:15:51.381 --> 00:15:52.214
<v Speaker 2>I think it is.</v>

410
00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:52.851
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

411
00:15:52.851 --> 00:15:54.920
<v Speaker 2>now each of the neurons,</v>

412
00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:57.860
<v Speaker 2>each of the cells in the phobia,</v>

413
00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:02.300
<v Speaker 2>which is the high resolution department connected to 10,000 cells in the primary</v>

414
00:16:02.301 --> 00:16:03.470
<v Speaker 2>visual cortex.</v>

415
00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:07.280
<v Speaker 2>And then they're connected to infinite numbers of cells,</v>

416
00:16:07.281 --> 00:16:08.630
<v Speaker 2>virtually about that.</v>

417
00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:12.680
<v Speaker 2>The reason I'm telling you that is because for the old tissue is neurally</v>

418
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:13.700
<v Speaker 2>expensive.</v>

419
00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:18.940
<v Speaker 2>And so if I needed my whole visual field to be as high resolution as my phobia,</v>

420
00:16:19.581 --> 00:16:23.210
<v Speaker 2>that I'd have to have a head like at ain't [inaudible] and that will be on doing</v>

421
00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:24.073
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

422
00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:24.861
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

423
00:16:24.861 --> 00:16:25.520
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

424
00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.500
<v Speaker 2>so what we do is we make the most of what we,</v>

425
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:30.650
<v Speaker 2>what we have and we'd Gardner eyes around all the time.</v>

426
00:16:30.651 --> 00:16:34.940
<v Speaker 2>So we're just sticking around is around like now taking snapshots of things and</v>

427
00:16:34.941 --> 00:16:39.260
<v Speaker 2>stitching them together very quickly and it gives us the illusion that we have</v>

428
00:16:39.261 --> 00:16:40.730
<v Speaker 2>the complete field of vision.</v>

429
00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:42.680
<v Speaker 2>It's not just an illusion,</v>

430
00:16:42.681 --> 00:16:42.951
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

431
00:16:42.951 --> 00:16:46.580
<v Speaker 2>because obviously you could walk across the street most of the time to be hit by</v>

432
00:16:46.581 --> 00:16:47.990
<v Speaker 2>anything that's moving too quickly.</v>

433
00:16:47.991 --> 00:16:50.960
<v Speaker 2>So it's suffice is to keep you alive.</v>

434
00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:53.810
<v Speaker 2>But there's way less of that there that you think.</v>

435
00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:59.270
<v Speaker 2>Now what I see in high resolution,</v>

436
00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:04.510
<v Speaker 2>so what I using my valuable neurological resources for is what I decided is</v>

437
00:17:05.121 --> 00:17:05.954
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

438
00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:10.040
<v Speaker 2>And you can tell what I decide is important by the fact that I knew looking at</v>

439
00:17:10.041 --> 00:17:10.550
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

440
00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:11.030
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

441
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:13.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm choosing to point by Isaac something of value.</v>

442
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:18.740
<v Speaker 2>Why else would I call it a point to my eyes there that the mere fact that I'm</v>

443
00:17:18.741 --> 00:17:23.741
<v Speaker 2>doing that is also an indication that I organized my perception with a value</v>

444
00:17:24.291 --> 00:17:25.040
<v Speaker 2>structure.</v>

445
00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:29.270
<v Speaker 2>And here's something that's really cool about people is because we want to look</v>

446
00:17:29.271 --> 00:17:30.170
<v Speaker 2>at what's valuable,</v>

447
00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:30.831
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

448
00:17:30.831 --> 00:17:34.370
<v Speaker 2>That that just seems kind of obvious why you love what is valuable when you</v>

449
00:17:34.371 --> 00:17:35.750
<v Speaker 2>could look at what's valuable.</v>

450
00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.080
<v Speaker 2>So how do you ensure what's valuable?</v>

451
00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:39.741
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

452
00:17:39.741 --> 00:17:42.410
<v Speaker 2>sometimes through painful learning,</v>

453
00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:43.670
<v Speaker 2>you learn what's going on,</v>

454
00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:44.150
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>

455
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:46.310
<v Speaker 2>But with PE,</v>

456
00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.210
<v Speaker 2>there's other tricks that we acquired.</v>

457
00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.080
<v Speaker 2>Figure out what's valuable to Sosa.</v>

458
00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:52.890
<v Speaker 2>Here's something cool about your eyes.</v>

459
00:17:52.891 --> 00:17:53.724
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

460
00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:56.670
<v Speaker 2>you have a pupil and then you have an iris around that.</v>

461
00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:59.100
<v Speaker 2>It's colorful and you have whites around that,</v>

462
00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.590
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

463
00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:00.770
<v Speaker 2>But you're weird.</v>

464
00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:01.411
<v Speaker 2>That rate,</v>

465
00:18:01.411 --> 00:18:04.380
<v Speaker 2>because animals don't have that even higher priorities.</v>

466
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.230
<v Speaker 2>The ones that are most akin to us biologically,</v>

467
00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:08.550
<v Speaker 2>they don't have that.</v>

468
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:09.991
<v Speaker 2>We do.</v>

469
00:18:09.991 --> 00:18:13.830
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is I want to see when you point your eyes,</v>

470
00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:18.240
<v Speaker 2>and if you're Irish to stepping out on a white background,</v>

471
00:18:18.241 --> 00:18:22.230
<v Speaker 2>I can really tell who your eyes are pointed and were unbelievably good.</v>

472
00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.420
<v Speaker 2>It's figuring out where people point their eyes.</v>

473
00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:25.311
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

474
00:18:25.311 --> 00:18:26.970
<v Speaker 2>When we interact with other people,</v>

475
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.860
<v Speaker 2>pretty much all you do is look at their eyes.</v>

476
00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:29.670
<v Speaker 2>Now it is.</v>

477
00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:30.300
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

478
00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:34.050
<v Speaker 2>Cause we look at their whole face cause they're signaling emotions with the face</v>

479
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:37.200
<v Speaker 2>or returned to figure out what all these other people that were looking to our</v>

480
00:18:37.201 --> 00:18:38.034
<v Speaker 2>opportunity.</v>

481
00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:39.480
<v Speaker 2>But part of the reason,</v>

482
00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:43.110
<v Speaker 2>part of the way that we figured out what they're up to is by inferring what they</v>

483
00:18:43.111 --> 00:18:44.490
<v Speaker 2>think is valuable.</v>

484
00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:48.270
<v Speaker 2>And the way that we infer what they think is valuable is by watching where they</v>

485
00:18:48.271 --> 00:18:49.300
<v Speaker 2>point thrice.</v>

486
00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:50.880
<v Speaker 2>And people are really good at pointing.</v>

487
00:18:50.881 --> 00:18:52.680
<v Speaker 2>Like if I pointed something,</v>

488
00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:55.140
<v Speaker 2>which is like an extension of my vision,</v>

489
00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:56.310
<v Speaker 2>if you have any sense,</v>

490
00:18:56.311 --> 00:18:58.380
<v Speaker 2>you don't look at my finger,</v>

491
00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:00.810
<v Speaker 2>you look at what I'm pointing out.</v>

492
00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:03.180
<v Speaker 2>Now an animal will look at your finger does.</v>

493
00:19:03.181 --> 00:19:04.890
<v Speaker 2>It just doesn't get the whole,</v>

494
00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:06.390
<v Speaker 2>there's something out there thing,</v>

495
00:19:06.391 --> 00:19:09.780
<v Speaker 2>which is part of the reason [inaudible] can't speak because the pointing</v>

496
00:19:09.781 --> 00:19:10.351
<v Speaker 2>gestures,</v>

497
00:19:10.351 --> 00:19:15.351
<v Speaker 2>prototypical speech it means signifies an object of value in often that object</v>

498
00:19:15.381 --> 00:19:15.630
<v Speaker 2>to go,</v>

499
00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:16.800
<v Speaker 2>you would have a name.</v>

500
00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:20.370
<v Speaker 2>So we point with our eyes or things of value.</v>

501
00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:22.110
<v Speaker 2>You can track people like this.</v>

502
00:19:22.111 --> 00:19:23.610
<v Speaker 2>So there's a famous site,</v>

503
00:19:23.611 --> 00:19:25.350
<v Speaker 2>social psychological experiments,</v>

504
00:19:25.351 --> 00:19:25.691
<v Speaker 2>kind of,</v>

505
00:19:25.691 --> 00:19:26.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

506
00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:26.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

507
00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:27.780
<v Speaker 2>casual experiment.</v>

508
00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:29.520
<v Speaker 2>So imagine that you're,</v>

509
00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:30.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

510
00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.160
<v Speaker 2>you're the experiment.</v>

511
00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:35.100
<v Speaker 2>This was done protective to go and all you do is decided to stand on the corner</v>

512
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:37.500
<v Speaker 2>and look up like this.</v>

513
00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:39.270
<v Speaker 2>It's on a busy street.</v>

514
00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:40.450
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

515
00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:41.880
<v Speaker 2>somebody walks by,</v>

516
00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:45.010
<v Speaker 2>they're kind of thinking that you'll look at that because there were two vague,</v>

517
00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:46.620
<v Speaker 2>you go and you just keep looking up.</v>

518
00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:47.970
<v Speaker 2>May Look at you,</v>

519
00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:49.890
<v Speaker 2>they look up and they look at you again.</v>

520
00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.000
<v Speaker 2>They looked up when they think,</v>

521
00:19:51.001 --> 00:19:51.834
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

522
00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:53.910
<v Speaker 2>unless there's something wrong with you,</v>

523
00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:55.500
<v Speaker 2>it must be something not that it is.</v>

524
00:19:55.501 --> 00:19:57.250
<v Speaker 2>Why would you be standing here looking at otherwise?</v>

525
00:19:57.350 --> 00:20:00.240
<v Speaker 2>And so they feel that there must be something important up there.</v>

526
00:20:00.241 --> 00:20:04.440
<v Speaker 2>And so then they'll look and they'll look at you to see what's going on.</v>

527
00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:08.040
<v Speaker 2>And then of course there's two of you located now.</v>

528
00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:10.740
<v Speaker 2>And so we're going to drop there must really be worth looking at.</v>

529
00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:12.990
<v Speaker 2>And so then the next person will come around and look to it.</v>

530
00:20:12.991 --> 00:20:14.310
<v Speaker 2>So you get a crowd crowded people.</v>

531
00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:17.120
<v Speaker 2>So if you're bored one day and you're smoking,</v>

532
00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:19.550
<v Speaker 2>smoking too much,</v>

533
00:20:19.551 --> 00:20:24.551
<v Speaker 2>pause the [inaudible] experiment about recorder,</v>

534
00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:25.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

535
00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:27.720
<v Speaker 2>so but credit.</v>

536
00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:28.770
<v Speaker 2>But there's something,</v>

537
00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:32.490
<v Speaker 2>there's something deep about that too because this is how we infer the</v>

538
00:20:32.491 --> 00:20:33.810
<v Speaker 2>motivation of other people.</v>

539
00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:36.910
<v Speaker 2>This is how we understand that it as we figure out what the hell they're going</v>

540
00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:40.500
<v Speaker 2>to app and that helps us even further value structure.</v>

541
00:20:40.501 --> 00:20:42.230
<v Speaker 2>And if I can infer your values culture,</v>

542
00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.070
<v Speaker 2>if I know what you find is important,</v>

543
00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:47.050
<v Speaker 2>then I can read you as a simulation online,</v>

544
00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:51.340
<v Speaker 2>biological platform and I can infer what you're thinking and feeling.</v>

545
00:20:51.341 --> 00:20:52.630
<v Speaker 2>And that's how we understand each other.</v>

546
00:20:52.631 --> 00:20:53.770
<v Speaker 2>That's how it works.</v>

547
00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:58.150
<v Speaker 2>We actually do use avoidance and computational platform to run this run</v>

548
00:20:58.151 --> 00:21:01.810
<v Speaker 2>simulations of other people and we do that by ensuring their value structure.</v>

549
00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:02.321
<v Speaker 2>We do that,</v>

550
00:21:02.321 --> 00:21:06.070
<v Speaker 2>but I got to get what they're looking like trying to go what they're looking at</v>

551
00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:08.080
<v Speaker 2>by trying to understand what they think is important.</v>

552
00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:09.940
<v Speaker 2>That's what you do with it moving,</v>

553
00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:10.540
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

554
00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:13.750
<v Speaker 2>You go to a movie like what the hell are you doing in a movie anyways?</v>

555
00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:13.991
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

556
00:21:13.991 --> 00:21:15.190
<v Speaker 2>it's entertaining.</v>

557
00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:15.970
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

558
00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:16.930
<v Speaker 2>that's not the question.</v>

559
00:21:16.931 --> 00:21:19.450
<v Speaker 2>The question is why is it entertaining?</v>

560
00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:23.890
<v Speaker 2>Why is it so important that you align up at pay to watch it?</v>

561
00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:25.120
<v Speaker 2>Like that's,</v>

562
00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:27.490
<v Speaker 2>that's really we're thinking about because you know,</v>

563
00:21:27.491 --> 00:21:28.570
<v Speaker 2>it's strange behavior.</v>

564
00:21:28.571 --> 00:21:29.020
<v Speaker 2>He fight.</v>

565
00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:34.020
<v Speaker 2>It's so useful to you that you find it intrinsically meaningful.</v>

566
00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:35.890
<v Speaker 2>So much so that you'll pay for it.</v>

567
00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:36.491
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

568
00:21:36.491 --> 00:21:37.181
<v Speaker 2>unless what?</v>

569
00:21:37.181 --> 00:21:38.200
<v Speaker 2>He would just put it your Thomas,</v>

570
00:21:38.201 --> 00:21:42.670
<v Speaker 2>is it just like useless activity or eating something that board or you're doing</v>

571
00:21:42.671 --> 00:21:43.570
<v Speaker 2>something important.</v>

572
00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:44.800
<v Speaker 2>You're going to,</v>

573
00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:46.870
<v Speaker 2>to what's essentially a literary,</v>

574
00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:48.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

575
00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:52.240
<v Speaker 2>what would you call literary experience because it's a story and you're locking</v>

576
00:21:52.241 --> 00:21:56.890
<v Speaker 2>yourself on the protagonist and the other characters and you're adopting their</v>

577
00:21:56.891 --> 00:22:01.891
<v Speaker 2>value structure and you're embodying that and you experience all the emotions</v>

578
00:22:02.111 --> 00:22:04.260
<v Speaker 2>and all the motivations for no,</v>

579
00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:04.700
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

580
00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:09.700
<v Speaker 2>no risk to yourself except the $14 that you pay to be admitted to the theater</v>

581
00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:13.020
<v Speaker 2>and you gain all that experience vicarious.</v>

582
00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:16.000
<v Speaker 2>And that's part of how you understand the world.</v>

583
00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:19.120
<v Speaker 2>And we're doing that with each other all the time when it thinks we're trying to</v>

584
00:22:19.121 --> 00:22:22.390
<v Speaker 2>do is to watch each other and figure out what support to the other person so</v>

585
00:22:22.391 --> 00:22:26.080
<v Speaker 2>that we can figure out what they're up to so that we convert what support for us</v>

586
00:22:26.081 --> 00:22:28.600
<v Speaker 2>so we can orient ourselves property in the world.</v>

587
00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:30.100
<v Speaker 2>It's a crucial,</v>

588
00:22:30.101 --> 00:22:31.150
<v Speaker 2>crucial importance.</v>

589
00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:33.700
<v Speaker 2>It's partly why stories are so important to kids.</v>

590
00:22:33.701 --> 00:22:34.480
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

591
00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.760
<v Speaker 2>you could teach kids over anything with the story,</v>

592
00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:37.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

593
00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:39.310
<v Speaker 2>will come running up to you with a book and say,</v>

594
00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.151
<v Speaker 2>read me a story.</v>

595
00:22:40.151 --> 00:22:40.930
<v Speaker 2>We'd be a story,</v>

596
00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:44.440
<v Speaker 2>maybe the same story 50 times what we're trying to understand it.</v>

597
00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:46.330
<v Speaker 2>That's how important it is.</v>

598
00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:50.170
<v Speaker 2>It's absolutely crucial and maybe it's crucial.</v>

599
00:22:50.171 --> 00:22:51.004
<v Speaker 2>Some of you can,</v>

600
00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:51.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

601
00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:53.530
<v Speaker 2>you could distinguish the gorillas from them,</v>

602
00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:56.080
<v Speaker 2>from the basketballs or something like that.</v>

603
00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:56.351
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

604
00:22:56.351 --> 00:23:01.351
<v Speaker 2>So that's another piece of evidence that we use our value structures to perceive</v>

605
00:23:02.591 --> 00:23:02.981
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

606
00:23:02.981 --> 00:23:04.270
<v Speaker 2>So that's took pieces of evidence.</v>

607
00:23:04.271 --> 00:23:06.310
<v Speaker 2>Here's another way of looking at it.</v>

608
00:23:06.311 --> 00:23:07.144
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

609
00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:08.093
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

610
00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:10.270
<v Speaker 2>if I'm looking at this landscape,</v>

611
00:23:10.271 --> 00:23:15.271
<v Speaker 2>let's say on what we see in front of me is going to depend on what I decide to</v>

612
00:23:16.571 --> 00:23:17.404
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

613
00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:20.950
<v Speaker 2>So now it's not only what I see and this is where it gets a little bit more</v>

614
00:23:20.951 --> 00:23:21.910
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated.</v>

615
00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:23.170
<v Speaker 2>It's not only what I see,</v>

616
00:23:23.171 --> 00:23:24.700
<v Speaker 2>it's what I experienced.</v>

617
00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:26.410
<v Speaker 2>It's broader than perception.</v>

618
00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:30.920
<v Speaker 2>And with experience I would say what motivates me and also what an experience</v>

619
00:23:30.921 --> 00:23:31.754
<v Speaker 2>emotionally.</v>

620
00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:34.420
<v Speaker 2>So here's a nice way of understanding emotions.</v>

621
00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:37.690
<v Speaker 2>It's very simple way and have the relationship with perception.</v>

622
00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:43.260
<v Speaker 2>So let's say I need to go over offstage on that side of the stage.</v>

623
00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:46.910
<v Speaker 2>And so if I'm standing here,</v>

624
00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:50.990
<v Speaker 2>I have a clear path right to the other side of the stage.</v>

625
00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:55.820
<v Speaker 2>And that's actually going to have a small effect on mine because once I decided</v>

626
00:23:55.821 --> 00:24:00.050
<v Speaker 2>that going to the other side of the stage is the valuable thing to do,</v>

627
00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:05.240
<v Speaker 2>when I see a clear path in front of me that produces a little burst of positive</v>

628
00:24:05.241 --> 00:24:06.074
<v Speaker 2>emotion.</v>

629
00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:10.130
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is that people experience caused propulsion in</v>

630
00:24:10.131 --> 00:24:14.000
<v Speaker 2>relationship to the likelihood that they're going to attain a value goal.</v>

631
00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:16.820
<v Speaker 2>This is also something that's worth thinking about because you tend to think,</v>

632
00:24:16.821 --> 00:24:17.480
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

633
00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:18.870
<v Speaker 2>you experienced cost promotion.</v>

634
00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:20.570
<v Speaker 2>When you get something you want.</v>

635
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.800
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

636
00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:22.940
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

637
00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:24.313
<v Speaker 2>wait a second.</v>

638
00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:26.150
<v Speaker 2>It's not so simple.</v>

639
00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:27.073
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

640
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:30.950
<v Speaker 2>let's say you want to have a promotion at work and so you get the promotion.</v>

641
00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:32.270
<v Speaker 2>Maybe have a party booked out,</v>

642
00:24:32.271 --> 00:24:33.980
<v Speaker 2>but what happens the next day?</v>

643
00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:34.751
<v Speaker 2>It's like what?</v>

644
00:24:34.751 --> 00:24:35.600
<v Speaker 2>You're nervous both,</v>

645
00:24:35.601 --> 00:24:35.901
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

646
00:24:35.901 --> 00:24:37.970
<v Speaker 2>Because you're not going to be word.</v>

647
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.890
<v Speaker 2>Now you have these new responsibilities,</v>

648
00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:42.560
<v Speaker 2>so it sounds like you're on cloud nine permanently,</v>

649
00:24:42.561 --> 00:24:44.930
<v Speaker 2>or maybe you graduated from high school and you're happy about that,</v>

650
00:24:44.931 --> 00:24:48.470
<v Speaker 2>but the next day then you've got a new set of problems.</v>

651
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:50.510
<v Speaker 2>The same if he graduates from university here,</v>

652
00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:53.420
<v Speaker 2>whenever you hit a good milestone in your life,</v>

653
00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:56.020
<v Speaker 2>it sounds like you're there and that's that.</v>

654
00:24:56.170 --> 00:25:00.590
<v Speaker 2>It's so that that that pleasure in the attainment of a goal could be quite</v>

655
00:25:00.591 --> 00:25:04.400
<v Speaker 2>fleeting because then you need another goal and even the fact that you need</v>

656
00:25:04.401 --> 00:25:07.080
<v Speaker 2>another goal after hitting that goal to be a problem.</v>

657
00:25:07.081 --> 00:25:10.070
<v Speaker 2>Like he might be depressed after graduating from high school cause you don't</v>

658
00:25:10.071 --> 00:25:11.330
<v Speaker 2>know what to do next.</v>

659
00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:13.130
<v Speaker 2>That happens to people all the time.</v>

660
00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:18.290
<v Speaker 2>So it turns out technically that the form of positive emotion,</v>

661
00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:22.040
<v Speaker 2>positive meaning that's more reliable than that is the positive emotion that's</v>

662
00:25:22.041 --> 00:25:25.460
<v Speaker 2>associated with the feeling that you're retaining a valuable goal.</v>

663
00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:27.560
<v Speaker 2>How that's worth thinking about too.</v>

664
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:31.400
<v Speaker 2>Because what it means is that if you want to the meaning of life that's</v>

665
00:25:31.401 --> 00:25:33.380
<v Speaker 2>positively engaging,</v>

666
00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:36.220
<v Speaker 2>then you have to be pursuing the valuable goal.</v>

667
00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:37.161
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

668
00:25:37.161 --> 00:25:39.770
<v Speaker 2>and then we can tie that back to the discussion at the beginning.</v>

669
00:25:39.771 --> 00:25:41.200
<v Speaker 2>It's like what?</v>

670
00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:45.380
<v Speaker 2>The way the world manifests itself to you depends on your aim.</v>

671
00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:46.371
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

672
00:25:46.371 --> 00:25:49.010
<v Speaker 2>And then if you're going to experience positive emotions world,</v>

673
00:25:49.011 --> 00:25:50.810
<v Speaker 2>you have to have a valuable aid.</v>

674
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:51.880
<v Speaker 2>And then there was a criminal,</v>

675
00:25:51.881 --> 00:25:52.750
<v Speaker 2>they reach about June,</v>

676
00:25:52.751 --> 00:25:55.430
<v Speaker 2>which is the more valuable your rating,</v>

677
00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:57.920
<v Speaker 2>the more positive emotional experience.</v>

678
00:25:57.921 --> 00:25:59.300
<v Speaker 2>While you're moving towards it.</v>

679
00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:00.680
<v Speaker 2>And so with that would imply,</v>

680
00:26:00.681 --> 00:26:01.341
<v Speaker 2>at least in part,</v>

681
00:26:01.341 --> 00:26:02.630
<v Speaker 2>is you want to have the most valuable,</v>

682
00:26:02.631 --> 00:26:03.650
<v Speaker 2>the impossible.</v>

683
00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:05.930
<v Speaker 2>That's what it seems to me.</v>

684
00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:06.920
<v Speaker 2>So then the question is,</v>

685
00:26:06.921 --> 00:26:07.191
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

686
00:26:07.191 --> 00:26:08.510
<v Speaker 2>what's the most valuable?</v>

687
00:26:08.511 --> 00:26:09.670
<v Speaker 2>A possible case.</v>

688
00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:10.790
<v Speaker 2>So that's where we'll go next.</v>

689
00:26:10.791 --> 00:26:11.210
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

690
00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:11.841
<v Speaker 2>but anyways,</v>

691
00:26:11.841 --> 00:26:13.250
<v Speaker 2>one of the consequences of that,</v>

692
00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:18.260
<v Speaker 2>even in the small and the microcosm that say is that if you see a clear pathway</v>

693
00:26:18.261 --> 00:26:19.610
<v Speaker 2>to a partial goal,</v>

694
00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.530
<v Speaker 2>that gives you that boost of positive emotion.</v>

695
00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:22.430
<v Speaker 2>Now pause.</v>

696
00:26:22.431 --> 00:26:26.060
<v Speaker 2>Depostion is also associated with the act of moving forward.</v>

697
00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:29.170
<v Speaker 2>So that's how your emotions are tied to your voice.</v>

698
00:26:29.171 --> 00:26:30.410
<v Speaker 2>So if you,</v>

699
00:26:30.411 --> 00:26:35.150
<v Speaker 2>if you're pursuing something of value and you have positive emotion that you</v>

700
00:26:35.151 --> 00:26:35.990
<v Speaker 2>have to pursue it,</v>

701
00:26:35.991 --> 00:26:37.090
<v Speaker 2>you're moving ahead and you know,</v>

702
00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:40.730
<v Speaker 2>that's what you're saying when someone says how you're doing and moving ahead in</v>

703
00:26:40.731 --> 00:26:41.990
<v Speaker 2>life is that,</v>

704
00:26:41.991 --> 00:26:43.410
<v Speaker 2>that's a positive thing to say,</v>

705
00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:43.830
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

706
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:44.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm kidding your hair.</v>

707
00:26:44.731 --> 00:26:45.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

708
00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:45.380
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

709
00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:47.070
<v Speaker 2>that's a positive thing as well.</v>

710
00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:48.510
<v Speaker 2>It's like climbing up a hill.</v>

711
00:26:48.511 --> 00:26:50.310
<v Speaker 2>That's a positive thing as well.</v>

712
00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:55.730
<v Speaker 2>So we know that approaching something moving forward is associated with positive</v>

713
00:26:56.410 --> 00:26:57.980
<v Speaker 2>emotion stopping.</v>

714
00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:01.650
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's what happens when something happens that you don't expect.</v>

715
00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:06.050
<v Speaker 2>So you're moving head towards a goal and something you don't expect conference</v>

716
00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:07.920
<v Speaker 2>or a threat to something dangerous.</v>

717
00:27:07.921 --> 00:27:09.660
<v Speaker 2>You start that same anxiety.</v>

718
00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:11.220
<v Speaker 2>Technically speaking,</v>

719
00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:16.400
<v Speaker 2>anxiety stops because you get anxious when you don't know what's going on.</v>

720
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:17.851
<v Speaker 2>You get anxious.</v>

721
00:27:17.851 --> 00:27:18.661
<v Speaker 2>What you don't know.</v>

722
00:27:18.661 --> 00:27:20.370
<v Speaker 2>If the path in front of you is clear,</v>

723
00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:23.370
<v Speaker 2>they want and you should stop because you don't know what's going to happen.</v>

724
00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:24.360
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

725
00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:25.193
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

726
00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:26.580
<v Speaker 2>and then to retreat,</v>

727
00:27:26.581 --> 00:27:30.030
<v Speaker 2>that's associated say with escaping from pain.</v>

728
00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:34.180
<v Speaker 2>So you basically have three modes of B move ahead.</v>

729
00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:34.730
<v Speaker 2>It's pause.</v>

730
00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:38.330
<v Speaker 2>If you stop and you get over there and that's,</v>

731
00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:39.810
<v Speaker 2>that's your whole and structure.</v>

732
00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:43.840
<v Speaker 2>And so if you see a pathway in front of you as clear,</v>

733
00:27:43.841 --> 00:27:44.840
<v Speaker 2>it just something you valued,</v>

734
00:27:44.841 --> 00:27:47.920
<v Speaker 2>they're not pushing the positive emotion and your staff,</v>

735
00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.620
<v Speaker 2>he moved forward forthright and they,</v>

736
00:27:49.621 --> 00:27:49.791
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

737
00:27:49.791 --> 00:27:51.480
<v Speaker 2>if I'm standing here,</v>

738
00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:55.980
<v Speaker 2>essentially it's just a little more complicated because there are things in the</v>

739
00:27:55.981 --> 00:27:56.940
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

740
00:27:58.010 --> 00:28:00.860
<v Speaker 2>and that's actually in some sense how I see them.</v>

741
00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:04.470
<v Speaker 2>Obviously that's a chair and that's a little stool.</v>

742
00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:05.101
<v Speaker 2>And you might say,</v>

743
00:28:05.101 --> 00:28:05.251
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

744
00:28:05.251 --> 00:28:06.600
<v Speaker 2>that's what those things are.</v>

745
00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:07.380
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

746
00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:07.900
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

747
00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:08.850
<v Speaker 2>he's not so simple.</v>

748
00:28:08.851 --> 00:28:10.200
<v Speaker 2>Exactly what they are.</v>

749
00:28:10.201 --> 00:28:10.981
<v Speaker 2>For me right now,</v>

750
00:28:10.981 --> 00:28:12.960
<v Speaker 2>there's minor legal obstacles.</v>

751
00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:16.020
<v Speaker 2>It in the pathway to my goal.</v>

752
00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:18.600
<v Speaker 2>And so they're dinged with a little bit of negative emotion.</v>

753
00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:18.930
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

754
00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:21.480
<v Speaker 2>not too much because I know I can just do this,</v>

755
00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:22.560
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

756
00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:27.090
<v Speaker 2>So I could solve the problem that those obstacles constituted so they don't</v>

757
00:28:27.091 --> 00:28:27.930
<v Speaker 2>bother me very much.</v>

758
00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:32.040
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that are being suggested to people is that it's become a bit</v>

759
00:28:32.041 --> 00:28:36.330
<v Speaker 2>of a need is that you should clean up your room and that's caught on like what</v>

760
00:28:36.331 --> 00:28:36.721
<v Speaker 2>the hell?</v>

761
00:28:36.721 --> 00:28:41.721
<v Speaker 2>Why did that catch what everyone has told you about since you were like one?</v>

762
00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:44.610
<v Speaker 2>So it's a funny thing,</v>

763
00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:45.260
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

764
00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:45.700
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

765
00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:47.160
<v Speaker 2>but there's deep reasons for it.</v>

766
00:28:47.161 --> 00:28:47.994
<v Speaker 2>It's like</v>

767
00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:50.280
<v Speaker 2>your room.</v>

768
00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:51.660
<v Speaker 2>Let's say you're in your room,</v>

769
00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:52.320
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>

770
00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:52.810
<v Speaker 2>We'll see.</v>

771
00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:56.460
<v Speaker 2>Are Your two hours a day just for the sake of arguments and so that we can do a</v>

772
00:28:56.461 --> 00:28:58.500
<v Speaker 2>little math there that says stupid mouth.</v>

773
00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.510
<v Speaker 2>So that's 14 hours a week.</v>

774
00:29:00.511 --> 00:29:01.320
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

775
00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:02.250
<v Speaker 2>that's one.</v>

776
00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:04.163
<v Speaker 2>That's one day.</v>

777
00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.400
<v Speaker 2>That's what they need in your life.</v>

778
00:29:05.401 --> 00:29:10.401
<v Speaker 2>Footsie or wait for doing something that is mandatory 14 hours a day.</v>

779
00:29:11.621 --> 00:29:13.500
<v Speaker 2>So it's one seventh of your life.</v>

780
00:29:13.501 --> 00:29:14.990
<v Speaker 2>And so in a,</v>

781
00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:15.661
<v Speaker 2>in a year,</v>

782
00:29:15.661 --> 00:29:17.100
<v Speaker 2>that would be a what?</v>

783
00:29:17.101 --> 00:29:19.080
<v Speaker 2>40 50 days,</v>

784
00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:19.980
<v Speaker 2>two months.</v>

785
00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:22.620
<v Speaker 2>You're in your own for two months every year.</v>

786
00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:24.390
<v Speaker 2>So that's one seventh of your life.</v>

787
00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:26.340
<v Speaker 2>And so it's all free to your room.</v>

788
00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:28.650
<v Speaker 2>It's really one seventh of your life,</v>

789
00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:29.820
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

790
00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:31.590
<v Speaker 2>You can think about it as a material place,</v>

791
00:29:31.591 --> 00:29:32.450
<v Speaker 2>that human habit,</v>

792
00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:33.361
<v Speaker 2>it is that.</v>

793
00:29:33.361 --> 00:29:34.920
<v Speaker 2>But that's not all it is.</v>

794
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:39.420
<v Speaker 2>It's a place that your experience is localized for one seventh of your life.</v>

795
00:29:39.421 --> 00:29:39.961
<v Speaker 2>And you might think,</v>

796
00:29:39.961 --> 00:29:40.560
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

797
00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:42.360
<v Speaker 2>how you want that experience delayed.</v>

798
00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:43.480
<v Speaker 2>So folks like,</v>

799
00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:43.781
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

800
00:29:43.781 --> 00:29:47.480
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want the place to be like an unruly hellhole so,</v>

801
00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:50.050
<v Speaker 2>so imagine that you have you things to do in there,</v>

802
00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:50.913
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

803
00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:54.700
<v Speaker 2>You have things to do in their work to maybe of thinking to do.</v>

804
00:29:54.701 --> 00:29:57.910
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you have to get dressed so you can present yourself to the world.</v>

805
00:29:57.940 --> 00:29:59.170
<v Speaker 2>They get off to sleep.</v>

806
00:29:59.230 --> 00:29:59.621
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

807
00:29:59.621 --> 00:30:00.200
<v Speaker 2>Whatever it is.</v>

808
00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.150
<v Speaker 2>If you're doing in your room,</v>

809
00:30:01.151 --> 00:30:04.090
<v Speaker 2>maybe playing on your computer to communicate with people.</v>

810
00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:06.220
<v Speaker 2>Let's assume some of that is useful.</v>

811
00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:09.630
<v Speaker 2>You know so well how do you want to organize that?</v>

812
00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:14.770
<v Speaker 2>And answer is you want to organize it beautifully and efficiently because if you</v>

813
00:30:14.771 --> 00:30:18.340
<v Speaker 2>do that and a good proportion of the one seventh of your life that you're</v>

814
00:30:18.341 --> 00:30:19.050
<v Speaker 2>spending in there,</v>

815
00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:20.500
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be a bipolar.</v>

816
00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:22.630
<v Speaker 2>And so if you organize that room,</v>

817
00:30:22.631 --> 00:30:25.210
<v Speaker 2>at least it make it clean,</v>

818
00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.840
<v Speaker 2>let's say that's the minimum starting place,</v>

819
00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:28.600
<v Speaker 2>make it clean.</v>

820
00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:31.970
<v Speaker 2>Then the pathway to all those things that you have to deal with,</v>

821
00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:35.050
<v Speaker 2>that room that are important becomes clear.</v>

822
00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:37.930
<v Speaker 2>And then when you walk into the room you're going to feel positive emotions,</v>

823
00:30:37.931 --> 00:30:39.100
<v Speaker 2>that negative emotion,</v>

824
00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:40.770
<v Speaker 2>you know this perfectly well,</v>

825
00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:42.080
<v Speaker 2>you know you don't perfectly well.</v>

826
00:30:42.081 --> 00:30:42.970
<v Speaker 2>I walked into your room,</v>

827
00:30:42.971 --> 00:30:47.680
<v Speaker 2>there's your desk and there's a bunch of things until their stacks of paper and</v>

828
00:30:47.681 --> 00:30:50.560
<v Speaker 2>you haven't booked out with for like three months and some of them are like</v>

829
00:30:50.561 --> 00:30:50.951
<v Speaker 2>cats,</v>

830
00:30:50.951 --> 00:30:51.430
<v Speaker 2>bills,</v>

831
00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:52.220
<v Speaker 2>phone bills,</v>

832
00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:52.931
<v Speaker 2>correspondence.</v>

833
00:30:52.931 --> 00:30:53.980
<v Speaker 2>You haven't caught up with it.</v>

834
00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:55.510
<v Speaker 2>God only knows what.</v>

835
00:30:55.511 --> 00:30:58.130
<v Speaker 2>And some of those bills are like older than they should be.</v>

836
00:30:58.310 --> 00:31:00.460
<v Speaker 2>You think those were just stacks of papers?</v>

837
00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:02.470
<v Speaker 2>Of course they're not there.</v>

838
00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:05.970
<v Speaker 2>They're not stacks of paper at all except for the most trivial sets.</v>

839
00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:09.700
<v Speaker 2>You're still annoyed with yourself and so terrified of them and when you walk</v>

840
00:31:09.701 --> 00:31:10.121
<v Speaker 2>into your room,</v>

841
00:31:10.121 --> 00:31:11.170
<v Speaker 2>do you want me to book them?</v>

842
00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:11.651
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

843
00:31:11.651 --> 00:31:12.401
<v Speaker 2>You'll still,</v>

844
00:31:12.401 --> 00:31:17.170
<v Speaker 2>you'll make a concerted effort not to look at your desk and if you,</v>

845
00:31:17.171 --> 00:31:19.450
<v Speaker 2>if your room gets cluttered enough and if you get,</v>

846
00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:22.870
<v Speaker 2>if your light's gets cluttered and outs and everything around you will be like</v>

847
00:31:22.871 --> 00:31:23.620
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

848
00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:28.620
<v Speaker 2>It's all cabled up pathways to hell essentially distributed randomly Greeley</v>

849
00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:30.641
<v Speaker 2>Rehab.</v>

850
00:31:30.641 --> 00:31:31.261
<v Speaker 2>We really,</v>

851
00:31:31.261 --> 00:31:35.470
<v Speaker 2>that serious hope is distributing sort of randomly through your house and then</v>

852
00:31:35.471 --> 00:31:36.170
<v Speaker 2>tower quarterly.</v>

853
00:31:36.170 --> 00:31:38.830
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have reasonable,</v>

854
00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:39.530
<v Speaker 2>productive,</v>

855
00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:40.241
<v Speaker 2>meaningful,</v>

856
00:31:40.241 --> 00:31:44.050
<v Speaker 2>beautiful experience if that's how you set up your environment.</v>

857
00:31:44.051 --> 00:31:45.610
<v Speaker 2>It's not your requirements,</v>

858
00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:47.410
<v Speaker 2>it's an extension of you.</v>

859
00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:51.850
<v Speaker 2>It's it can't think of it any more clearly than that.</v>

860
00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:56.570
<v Speaker 2>So with a behavioral psychologists know perfectly well what going to take.</v>

861
00:31:56.610 --> 00:31:57.071
<v Speaker 2>You could do.</v>

862
00:31:57.071 --> 00:31:59.800
<v Speaker 2>If you want to get people to start organizing themselves mentally,</v>

863
00:31:59.801 --> 00:32:02.760
<v Speaker 2>he's to do something like organize their desk,</v>

864
00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:03.100
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

865
00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:03.371
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

866
00:32:03.371 --> 00:32:06.940
<v Speaker 2>I know some of you have idiosyncratically cluttered desks and you know where</v>

867
00:32:06.941 --> 00:32:11.400
<v Speaker 2>everything is and that's your weird little style and maybe that works for you</v>

868
00:32:11.401 --> 00:32:11.660
<v Speaker 2>all know,</v>

869
00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:14.700
<v Speaker 2>probably mostly instructional aid station Bas,</v>

870
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:15.703
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

871
00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:19.421
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

872
00:32:19.421 --> 00:32:19.631
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

873
00:32:19.631 --> 00:32:20.201
<v Speaker 2>that's just,</v>

874
00:32:20.201 --> 00:32:21.440
<v Speaker 2>that's just the way I do it.</v>

875
00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:21.821
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

876
00:32:21.821 --> 00:32:22.654
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

877
00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:25.603
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

878
00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:28.810
<v Speaker 2>if you take a take a shot at organizing that,</v>

879
00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:33.010
<v Speaker 2>making them pathways clear and things clear up the front of you and the</v>

880
00:32:33.011 --> 00:32:36.400
<v Speaker 2>probability that when you walk into your room it's going to welcome.</v>

881
00:32:36.401 --> 00:32:36.910
<v Speaker 2>You think,</v>

882
00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:37.001
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

883
00:32:37.001 --> 00:32:37.771
<v Speaker 2>that's weird.</v>

884
00:32:37.771 --> 00:32:37.931
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>

885
00:32:37.931 --> 00:32:38.651
<v Speaker 2>you're looking at it,</v>

886
00:32:38.651 --> 00:32:40.070
<v Speaker 2>the group create welcome you.</v>

887
00:32:40.071 --> 00:32:40.904
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

888
00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:41.751
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

889
00:32:41.751 --> 00:32:44.680
<v Speaker 2>You've never been in a room that's Bosco t it's just has,</v>

890
00:32:44.681 --> 00:32:46.130
<v Speaker 2>you're not paying any attention.</v>

891
00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:50.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's any theme in this auditory who don't like certain rooms in</v>

892
00:32:50.901 --> 00:32:51.410
<v Speaker 2>their house,</v>

893
00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:55.280
<v Speaker 2>don't like going into them because God only knows what's in there.</v>

894
00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:58.910
<v Speaker 2>You know when you could feel that emanating from those places.</v>

895
00:32:58.911 --> 00:33:03.890
<v Speaker 2>Where do you store the hundred and 50,000 decisions that you should've made your</v>

896
00:33:03.891 --> 00:33:08.300
<v Speaker 2>life that you didn't make in the forums have stacks of things that you should</v>

897
00:33:08.301 --> 00:33:10.070
<v Speaker 2>have attended two years ago.</v>

898
00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:13.400
<v Speaker 2>If you don't think that it has any effect on you and you've just dealt with your</v>

899
00:33:13.401 --> 00:33:17.750
<v Speaker 2>senses to the point where you don't notice because certainly has an effect on</v>

900
00:33:17.751 --> 00:33:19.400
<v Speaker 2>you and you might also think,</v>

901
00:33:19.401 --> 00:33:22.670
<v Speaker 2>well maybe you what we want to clean up your room,</v>

902
00:33:22.671 --> 00:33:26.390
<v Speaker 2>which is something you know you want to make it beautiful,</v>

903
00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:29.600
<v Speaker 2>how it means something even greater and something I didn't write your voting</v>

904
00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:31.340
<v Speaker 2>quotables life in product.</v>

905
00:33:31.341 --> 00:33:32.400
<v Speaker 2>We'd be in the next book.</v>

906
00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:34.490
<v Speaker 2>It's like you could take it to the next step.</v>

907
00:33:34.491 --> 00:33:39.320
<v Speaker 2>You could normally set up your room so that you knew where your clothes were and</v>

908
00:33:39.321 --> 00:33:44.240
<v Speaker 2>you knew why you were aware and you knew who you were going to be when you more</v>

909
00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:47.630
<v Speaker 2>and you set up the place that you slate so that when you went to sleep you</v>

910
00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:48.171
<v Speaker 2>slept.</v>

911
00:33:48.171 --> 00:33:49.940
<v Speaker 2>So that B when you will come to the morning,</v>

912
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.150
<v Speaker 2>like you were refreshed and ready to take on the world.</v>

913
00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:56.930
<v Speaker 2>So the whole place was pristine and it reflected your discipline and then you</v>

914
00:33:56.931 --> 00:34:00.680
<v Speaker 2>could make the bloody place beautiful because you would learn how to do that.</v>

915
00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:01.640
<v Speaker 2>You might take boats,</v>

916
00:34:01.641 --> 00:34:02.790
<v Speaker 2>just my room.</v>

917
00:34:02.791 --> 00:34:04.700
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're a wealthy man.</v>

918
00:34:04.701 --> 00:34:05.770
<v Speaker 2>It hasn't been very long.</v>

919
00:34:05.771 --> 00:34:09.200
<v Speaker 2>So it hasn't been very long at all in the history of the world that people have</v>

920
00:34:09.201 --> 00:34:10.430
<v Speaker 2>their own room.</v>

921
00:34:10.490 --> 00:34:12.230
<v Speaker 2>It's a bloody miracle that you have that.</v>

922
00:34:12.231 --> 00:34:14.660
<v Speaker 2>And especially with the kind of rooms we have now,</v>

923
00:34:14.870 --> 00:34:15.691
<v Speaker 2>and that's the case.</v>

924
00:34:15.691 --> 00:34:16.610
<v Speaker 2>Even if you live in,</v>

925
00:34:16.930 --> 00:34:17.211
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

926
00:34:17.211 --> 00:34:18.150
<v Speaker 2>maybe the most talk,</v>

927
00:34:18.151 --> 00:34:19.930
<v Speaker 2>the most desirable part of town,</v>

928
00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:23.410
<v Speaker 2>you could still make that middle area that you're responsible for something</v>

929
00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:25.610
<v Speaker 2>bloody pristine and perfect.</v>

930
00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:29.210
<v Speaker 2>And that would teach you how to make a little corner of the world pristine and</v>

931
00:34:29.211 --> 00:34:31.460
<v Speaker 2>perfect and that would help you be that way.</v>

932
00:34:31.461 --> 00:34:33.230
<v Speaker 2>And then you being that way,</v>

933
00:34:33.231 --> 00:34:36.260
<v Speaker 2>he be rude being that way with the ahead to your family.</v>

934
00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:38.390
<v Speaker 2>Or they might have checked what nab and he'd say,</v>

935
00:34:38.391 --> 00:34:38.620
<v Speaker 2>grow,</v>

936
00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:39.980
<v Speaker 2>wake her up to it.</v>

937
00:34:40.490 --> 00:34:40.851
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

938
00:34:40.851 --> 00:34:44.780
<v Speaker 2>and then maybe from there you can start to branch that out into the other things</v>

939
00:34:44.781 --> 00:34:47.670
<v Speaker 2>that you're doing because these are not trivial issues there.</v>

940
00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:48.201
<v Speaker 2>They're very,</v>

941
00:34:48.201 --> 00:34:49.580
<v Speaker 2>very fundamental issues.</v>

942
00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:51.620
<v Speaker 2>So to want to make your,</v>

943
00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:56.600
<v Speaker 2>make your room that you would have the vast majority of the time into a</v>

944
00:34:56.601 --> 00:34:59.630
<v Speaker 2>microcosm of the way that you would like things to be.</v>

945
00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:02.690
<v Speaker 2>It's an unbelievably useful exercise.</v>

946
00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:06.590
<v Speaker 2>What's so cool about it is you can just do it to practice right there in front</v>

947
00:35:06.591 --> 00:35:06.741
<v Speaker 2>of you.</v>

948
00:35:06.741 --> 00:35:11.741
<v Speaker 2>There's absolutely nothing stopping you except your contempt for what you have.</v>

949
00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:14.470
<v Speaker 2>And that's something you should just dispense with entirely.</v>

950
00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:16.400
<v Speaker 2>Because what's not helpful?</v>

951
00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:17.810
<v Speaker 2>It's not helpful.</v>

952
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:18.890
<v Speaker 2>It's not accurate.</v>

953
00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:19.731
<v Speaker 2>It's not helpful.</v>

954
00:35:19.731 --> 00:35:21.470
<v Speaker 2>It's not psychologically useful.</v>

955
00:35:21.471 --> 00:35:22.190
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

956
00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:23.570
<v Speaker 2>it's counterproductive.</v>

957
00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:24.950
<v Speaker 2>It's not good.</v>

958
00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:25.370
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

959
00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:26.203
<v Speaker 2>We'll</v>

960
00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:28.790
<v Speaker 2>only so,</v>

961
00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:30.380
<v Speaker 2>so now let's,</v>

962
00:35:30.381 --> 00:35:30.741
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

963
00:35:30.741 --> 00:35:32.480
<v Speaker 2>let's go into this a bit more deeply.</v>

964
00:35:32.481 --> 00:35:33.300
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

965
00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:33.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

966
00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:37.380
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I do with my students when I'm feeling like torturing is</v>

967
00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:39.550
<v Speaker 2>asking why,</v>

968
00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:40.403
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>

969
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:41.303
<v Speaker 2>why they're,</v>

970
00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:42.540
<v Speaker 2>why they're in class.</v>

971
00:35:42.541 --> 00:35:42.961
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

972
00:35:42.961 --> 00:35:44.260
<v Speaker 2>say you're trying to do an assignment,</v>

973
00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:45.001
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

974
00:35:45.001 --> 00:35:45.834
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

975
00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:48.053
<v Speaker 2>why do you care?</v>

976
00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:49.133
<v Speaker 2>You do.</v>

977
00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:54.210
<v Speaker 2>Usually you can get about five ounces of people with this line of questioning</v>

978
00:35:54.211 --> 00:35:57.750
<v Speaker 2>before they run out of answers and then they're not happy that you keep</v>

979
00:35:57.751 --> 00:35:59.180
<v Speaker 2>questioning it because it's rude.</v>

980
00:35:59.181 --> 00:36:01.240
<v Speaker 2>It's like when you care about the assignment,</v>

981
00:36:01.241 --> 00:36:01.801
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

982
00:36:01.801 --> 00:36:02.634
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

983
00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:06.780
<v Speaker 2>I need to hand in the assignment to get a good grade in the course.</v>

984
00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:08.520
<v Speaker 2>Why do you care about what they not?</v>

985
00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:09.920
<v Speaker 2>You get a good grade in the course.</v>

986
00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:10.231
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

987
00:36:10.231 --> 00:36:11.064
<v Speaker 2>I need to,</v>

988
00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:14.250
<v Speaker 2>I need to finish off this year universe.</v>

989
00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:15.330
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

990
00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:16.680
<v Speaker 2>I need to do that.</v>

991
00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:17.131
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

992
00:36:17.131 --> 00:36:20.580
<v Speaker 2>I need to graduate and and and have a degree.</v>

993
00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:21.651
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

994
00:36:21.651 --> 00:36:22.780
<v Speaker 2>why do you need to be fast?</v>

995
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:23.221
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

996
00:36:23.221 --> 00:36:23.461
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

997
00:36:23.461 --> 00:36:24.420
<v Speaker 2>because I need to,</v>

998
00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:27.030
<v Speaker 2>I need to get a job and support myself.</v>

999
00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:27.893
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1000
00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:29.670
<v Speaker 2>you get the basic idea.</v>

1001
00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:32.190
<v Speaker 2>Why do you need to do that as well?</v>

1002
00:36:32.191 --> 00:36:34.160
<v Speaker 2>I want to have a career.</v>

1003
00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:35.480
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I want to have a family.</v>

1004
00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:36.120
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1005
00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:36.391
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1006
00:36:36.391 --> 00:36:39.800
<v Speaker 2>well why do you need to do that if you keep asking that question now,</v>

1007
00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:41.100
<v Speaker 2>now what?</v>

1008
00:36:41.101 --> 00:36:44.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm what I'm pointing out here is something that's sort of analogous to what I</v>

1009
00:36:44.731 --> 00:36:46.720
<v Speaker 2>was pointing out when I was unblinded.</v>

1010
00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:49.860
<v Speaker 2>Why you went to the lab to begin with and follow the instructions,</v>

1011
00:36:49.861 --> 00:36:50.041
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1012
00:36:50.041 --> 00:36:53.340
<v Speaker 2>There's a whole bunch of reasons that are determining your behave and so when</v>

1013
00:36:53.341 --> 00:36:56.730
<v Speaker 2>you do something like maybe you're going to a library and so we have to cross</v>

1014
00:36:56.731 --> 00:36:57.660
<v Speaker 2>the street.</v>

1015
00:36:57.720 --> 00:36:59.320
<v Speaker 2>If cross the street to the library,</v>

1016
00:36:59.321 --> 00:37:01.540
<v Speaker 2>when you have to get to the library to pick up a book and you have to pick up a</v>

1017
00:37:01.541 --> 00:37:03.950
<v Speaker 2>book to study and you need to study to pass the exam.</v>

1018
00:37:03.970 --> 00:37:07.620
<v Speaker 2>Then that nests inside all of those other plans that I just described.</v>

1019
00:37:07.621 --> 00:37:10.680
<v Speaker 2>So normally do you have a need,</v>

1020
00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:11.603
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

1021
00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:15.570
<v Speaker 2>but you have a name that's nested inside of a bunch of other readers and so</v>

1022
00:37:15.571 --> 00:37:20.571
<v Speaker 2>that's how you focus your attention on the world is I need to cross the street</v>

1023
00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:23.670
<v Speaker 2>because I need to go to the library because I needed to get a book because I</v>

1024
00:37:23.671 --> 00:37:27.300
<v Speaker 2>need to study because I need to pass the exam because I need to pass the course</v>

1025
00:37:27.301 --> 00:37:30.420
<v Speaker 2>because I need to get the degree so it's like get a job so that I could take my</v>

1026
00:37:30.421 --> 00:37:32.160
<v Speaker 2>place in the community and what you,</v>

1027
00:37:32.170 --> 00:37:34.980
<v Speaker 2>what you notice is that with each of those questions,</v>

1028
00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:40.590
<v Speaker 2>the area that you're eating covers in terms of timing space,</v>

1029
00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:42.870
<v Speaker 2>that's the right way of thinking about gets bigger,</v>

1030
00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:43.470
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1031
00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:46.410
<v Speaker 2>Because crossing the street that's like the five second thing and going to the</v>

1032
00:37:46.411 --> 00:37:47.830
<v Speaker 2>library to get a bulk rate.</v>

1033
00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:52.100
<v Speaker 2>That's like a one hour thing and then study a one week they your cortices,</v>

1034
00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:56.880
<v Speaker 2>a one month thing or three months they are with each of those successive moves</v>

1035
00:37:56.881 --> 00:38:01.881
<v Speaker 2>out where outward you're describing a series of agents that cover a larger area</v>

1036
00:38:03.301 --> 00:38:04.860
<v Speaker 2>of space and time.</v>

1037
00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:08.010
<v Speaker 2>So you can think about that as your map of the space and time.</v>

1038
00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:12.460
<v Speaker 2>And that's a useful map because you live in space and time and so you should map</v>

1039
00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:16.770
<v Speaker 2>and that's what you do with your value structure because all of that's value,</v>

1040
00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:17.371
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1041
00:38:17.371 --> 00:38:21.060
<v Speaker 2>It's all assumption about what it is that's necessary to do.</v>

1042
00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:22.680
<v Speaker 2>So then the question is,</v>

1043
00:38:22.681 --> 00:38:25.680
<v Speaker 2>well what is it necessary to do?</v>

1044
00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:29.010
<v Speaker 2>How far out can you push that step up?</v>

1045
00:38:29.011 --> 00:38:29.711
<v Speaker 2>Assumptions.</v>

1046
00:38:29.711 --> 00:38:30.031
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1047
00:38:30.031 --> 00:38:35.031
<v Speaker 2>well it's kind of pushed it out to well I want to be a productive person who a</v>

1048
00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:40.670
<v Speaker 2>and I want to have a family take [inaudible] well maybe people stopped there</v>

1049
00:38:41.121 --> 00:38:43.130
<v Speaker 2>because they think at south,</v>

1050
00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:44.620
<v Speaker 2>but it's something like that.</v>

1051
00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:46.570
<v Speaker 2>It collapses into self evidence.</v>

1052
00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:47.930
<v Speaker 2>So it's rude bullshit.</v>

1053
00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:48.551
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1054
00:38:48.551 --> 00:38:49.810
<v Speaker 2>well it does.</v>

1055
00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:50.630
<v Speaker 2>It does.</v>

1056
00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:51.041
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

1057
00:38:51.041 --> 00:38:51.791
<v Speaker 2>Cause you might ask,</v>

1058
00:38:51.791 --> 00:38:52.240
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1059
00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:52.601
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1060
00:38:52.601 --> 00:38:54.370
<v Speaker 2>let's say you're going to have a career and a family.</v>

1061
00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:55.690
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1062
00:38:55.690 --> 00:38:59.660
<v Speaker 2>is there a map in which that should be embedded?</v>

1063
00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:01.030
<v Speaker 2>And then the question would be,</v>

1064
00:39:01.031 --> 00:39:01.181
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

1065
00:39:01.181 --> 00:39:03.190
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to have a career to a family,</v>

1066
00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:07.570
<v Speaker 2>how should you go about doing that in the best possible way?</v>

1067
00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:09.970
<v Speaker 2>Because I would be the next question.</v>

1068
00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:13.090
<v Speaker 2>At some point you're going to run out of ability to question.</v>

1069
00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:16.300
<v Speaker 2>You're going to hit hit the ultimate ends of the map.</v>

1070
00:39:16.301 --> 00:39:20.860
<v Speaker 2>I would say what seems to happen as far as I can tell is that when you get out</v>

1071
00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:23.170
<v Speaker 2>that far in the line of ethical questioning,</v>

1072
00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:24.630
<v Speaker 2>you start pictured that domain.</v>

1073
00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:28.570
<v Speaker 2>It's something like the story because if you don't have an explicit answer</v>

1074
00:39:28.571 --> 00:39:29.050
<v Speaker 2>anymore,</v>

1075
00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:29.291
<v Speaker 2>just say,</v>

1076
00:39:29.291 --> 00:39:32.650
<v Speaker 2>well I'm going to have a family and I couldn't have a career.</v>

1077
00:39:32.650 --> 00:39:33.011
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

1078
00:39:33.011 --> 00:39:35.320
<v Speaker 2>well why are you going to do that?</v>

1079
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:37.240
<v Speaker 2>Why is that an important thing to do?</v>

1080
00:39:37.241 --> 00:39:39.340
<v Speaker 2>Or how would you do that if you did it right?</v>

1081
00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:40.930
<v Speaker 2>And then when you do what,</v>

1082
00:39:40.931 --> 00:39:43.930
<v Speaker 2>at some point when you run out of explicit answers,</v>

1083
00:39:43.931 --> 00:39:45.550
<v Speaker 2>you start thinking about examples.</v>

1084
00:39:45.551 --> 00:39:46.121
<v Speaker 2>And you might think,</v>

1085
00:39:46.121 --> 00:39:48.020
<v Speaker 2>well that's where people have already always done it.</v>

1086
00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:50.470
<v Speaker 2>That's when people I admire hooked up.</v>

1087
00:39:50.471 --> 00:39:50.650
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1088
00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:51.370
<v Speaker 2>that's what,</v>

1089
00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:52.400
<v Speaker 2>that's what my father did.</v>

1090
00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:54.010
<v Speaker 2>That was what my grandfather did.</v>

1091
00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:54.970
<v Speaker 2>Or I knew,</v>

1092
00:39:54.970 --> 00:39:57.790
<v Speaker 2>I knew people who took real pride in their work and that's,</v>

1093
00:39:57.850 --> 00:39:59.320
<v Speaker 2>and that's how I want to conduct myself.</v>

1094
00:39:59.321 --> 00:40:01.300
<v Speaker 2>So you start to devolve,</v>

1095
00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:04.870
<v Speaker 2>what would you say your explicit precept position started to shout into</v>

1096
00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:06.460
<v Speaker 2>something like stories.</v>

1097
00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:11.680
<v Speaker 2>And so that's where our explicit knowledge meets the domain of the great story.</v>

1098
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:15.070
<v Speaker 2>So what's the great story?</v>

1099
00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:16.460
<v Speaker 2>What's all that nested it?</v>

1100
00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:21.220
<v Speaker 2>This is where the discussion gets more complicated and this is where,</v>

1101
00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:24.220
<v Speaker 2>this is where it would have to dig to get this right.</v>

1102
00:40:26.770 --> 00:40:27.500
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1103
00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:32.500
<v Speaker 2>Have you tried to understand what it means to act ethically and all that?</v>

1104
00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:37.520
<v Speaker 2>Starting with the presupposition that that actually does mean something?</v>

1105
00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:38.900
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

1106
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:40.550
<v Speaker 2>in our modern world,</v>

1107
00:40:40.610 --> 00:40:43.040
<v Speaker 2>people tend towards a kind of moral relativism.</v>

1108
00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:45.080
<v Speaker 2>They make the proposition that there's many,</v>

1109
00:40:45.081 --> 00:40:48.940
<v Speaker 2>many ethical systems and it's very difficult to adjudicate between them.</v>

1110
00:40:48.941 --> 00:40:52.610
<v Speaker 2>And maybe there's no ethical system that has predominance over any other ethical</v>

1111
00:40:52.611 --> 00:40:53.041
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

1112
00:40:53.041 --> 00:40:53.960
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>

1113
00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:55.310
<v Speaker 2>But I don't buy that.</v>

1114
00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:56.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's true at all.</v>

1115
00:40:56.841 --> 00:41:00.950
<v Speaker 2>I think that there's very limited number of ways that you could make your way</v>

1116
00:41:00.951 --> 00:41:02.510
<v Speaker 2>through the world properly,</v>

1117
00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:04.990
<v Speaker 2>and that that's severely constraints.</v>

1118
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.160
<v Speaker 2>The value system that you have to a dog,</v>

1119
00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:07.611
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>

1120
00:41:07.611 --> 00:41:08.240
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1121
00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:09.290
<v Speaker 2>if you want to,</v>

1122
00:41:10.290 --> 00:41:10.420
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

1123
00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:11.300
<v Speaker 2>you want to be,</v>

1124
00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:16.550
<v Speaker 2>if you want to be a family and you want to do that properly,</v>

1125
00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.863
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

1126
00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:21.560
<v Speaker 2>then how might you go about doing that?</v>

1127
00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:22.790
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1128
00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:23.623
<v Speaker 2>let's see if we can,</v>

1129
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:25.420
<v Speaker 2>we can take that apart and look a bit.</v>

1130
00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:26.613
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1131
00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:30.070
<v Speaker 2>I can use this as a,</v>

1132
00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:31.113
<v Speaker 2>as a means of,</v>

1133
00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:32.720
<v Speaker 2>as a means of,</v>

1134
00:41:33.810 --> 00:41:34.643
<v Speaker 2>of examples.</v>

1135
00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:36.673
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1136
00:41:37.050 --> 00:41:38.630
<v Speaker 2>You want to be a good father.</v>

1137
00:41:39.970 --> 00:41:44.970
<v Speaker 2>And so then imagine that one of the things for the good father does is teach his</v>

1138
00:41:45.231 --> 00:41:48.410
<v Speaker 2>children how to behave properly.</v>

1139
00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:50.440
<v Speaker 2>So that's rule number five in my book,</v>

1140
00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:50.631
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1141
00:41:50.631 --> 00:41:53.970
<v Speaker 2>Don't let your children do anything that makes you dislike them.</v>

1142
00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:58.790
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to give you a sophisticated example about how you might teach your</v>

1143
00:41:58.791 --> 00:42:00.380
<v Speaker 2>children to behave properly.</v>

1144
00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:04.700
<v Speaker 2>And that would be part of the structure in which being a good parent would be</v>

1145
00:42:04.701 --> 00:42:05.534
<v Speaker 2>nested.</v>

1146
00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:05.931
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1147
00:42:05.931 --> 00:42:10.530
<v Speaker 2>So I'll tell you a little story about hockey game.</v>

1148
00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:13.580
<v Speaker 2>I've watched once was a cocky gate that my kid,</v>

1149
00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:14.960
<v Speaker 2>something was involved in it.</v>

1150
00:42:15.110 --> 00:42:17.990
<v Speaker 2>He was a pretty decent talked there and he was on the book 13 when this was</v>

1151
00:42:17.991 --> 00:42:18.800
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>

1152
00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:23.660
<v Speaker 2>But he used to go watch him play at least those neighborhood lead and here's a</v>

1153
00:42:23.661 --> 00:42:24.320
<v Speaker 2>good hockey player.</v>

1154
00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:26.060
<v Speaker 2>But he wasn't the best talking to bear and his team.</v>

1155
00:42:26.061 --> 00:42:30.170
<v Speaker 2>There's this other kid that was clearly at the start and we were watching this,</v>

1156
00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:32.880
<v Speaker 2>the championship game and uh,</v>

1157
00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:33.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1158
00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:37.930
<v Speaker 2>it was well if foc game between well-matched dinged.</v>

1159
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:38.870
<v Speaker 2>So that's a good thing.</v>

1160
00:42:38.871 --> 00:42:39.201
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1161
00:42:39.201 --> 00:42:41.690
<v Speaker 2>Generally if you want to watch a sports game,</v>

1162
00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:42.570
<v Speaker 2>weirdly enough,</v>

1163
00:42:42.571 --> 00:42:46.880
<v Speaker 2>do you want to see a well 14 between well-matched teams.</v>

1164
00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:50.120
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to see one team just stomp the hell out of the other,</v>

1165
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.983
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1166
00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:55.280
<v Speaker 2>and have the game be 18 to one it's not that sox fine.</v>

1167
00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:57.200
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to see the struggle?</v>

1168
00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:59.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm full and it been relatively matched manner.</v>

1169
00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:03.200
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of interesting because it's not obvious why you would want to see,</v>

1170
00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:03.471
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1171
00:43:03.471 --> 00:43:04.400
<v Speaker 2>one team just,</v>

1172
00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:05.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1173
00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:06.080
<v Speaker 2>beat to death,</v>

1174
00:43:06.081 --> 00:43:07.670
<v Speaker 2>so to speak by either,</v>

1175
00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:09.680
<v Speaker 2>maybe you could take some gratification in that,</v>

1176
00:43:09.681 --> 00:43:11.390
<v Speaker 2>but if you have any sense you don't,</v>

1177
00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:13.910
<v Speaker 2>you want to see the team struggle against each other.</v>

1178
00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:15.350
<v Speaker 2>You want the outcome to be,</v>

1179
00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:20.480
<v Speaker 2>to be too hard enough so that it's uncertain and you want to see the spectacle</v>

1180
00:43:20.490 --> 00:43:21.590
<v Speaker 2>unfold in real time.</v>

1181
00:43:21.591 --> 00:43:22.670
<v Speaker 2>And so that's what was happening.</v>

1182
00:43:22.671 --> 00:43:23.900
<v Speaker 2>So it was really good game.</v>

1183
00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:25.490
<v Speaker 2>And then in the last six,</v>

1184
00:43:25.491 --> 00:43:26.960
<v Speaker 2>seven seconds of the game,</v>

1185
00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:29.090
<v Speaker 2>real cliffhanger or something like that,</v>

1186
00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:29.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1187
00:43:29.350 --> 00:43:32.520
<v Speaker 2>about six or seven seconds on the kids from the opposing team.</v>

1188
00:43:32.521 --> 00:43:35.610
<v Speaker 2>Zicam ice can't beautiful place or oppose goes the rent.</v>

1189
00:43:35.611 --> 00:43:37.580
<v Speaker 2>And that was the end of the game and everybody cloud.</v>

1190
00:43:37.581 --> 00:43:38.091
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1191
00:43:38.091 --> 00:43:39.890
<v Speaker 2>the kids lined up and shook each other's hands.</v>

1192
00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:42.500
<v Speaker 2>But the star on my son's team,</v>

1193
00:43:42.590 --> 00:43:43.460
<v Speaker 2>he was knocked out,</v>

1194
00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:45.550
<v Speaker 2>he was not happy.</v>

1195
00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:46.280
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

1196
00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:49.910
<v Speaker 2>he was acting out the proposition that he had been wrong.</v>

1197
00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:53.320
<v Speaker 2>And so he got off the ice and he took his hockey stick and he smashed it up.</v>

1198
00:43:53.321 --> 00:43:56.620
<v Speaker 2>The spent them a little tantrum and old and uh,</v>

1199
00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:58.190
<v Speaker 2>which was pretty pathetic.</v>

1200
00:43:58.820 --> 00:43:59.560
<v Speaker 2>His father,</v>

1201
00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:00.241
<v Speaker 2>seriously.</v>

1202
00:44:00.241 --> 00:44:00.650
<v Speaker 2>That's like,</v>

1203
00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:01.490
<v Speaker 2>what the hell?</v>

1204
00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:06.170
<v Speaker 2>And so then as far as father came rushing up and his father was a preposterous</v>

1205
00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:07.013
<v Speaker 2>idea</v>

1206
00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:11.390
<v Speaker 2>and he basically agreed with this sub.</v>

1207
00:44:11.391 --> 00:44:11.661
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

1208
00:44:11.661 --> 00:44:11.991
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1209
00:44:11.991 --> 00:44:12.141
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1210
00:44:12.141 --> 00:44:12.931
<v Speaker 2>you were abroad.</v>

1211
00:44:12.931 --> 00:44:14.690
<v Speaker 2>Did you played such as protection again,</v>

1212
00:44:14.691 --> 00:44:17.720
<v Speaker 2>you should one the referees took it away from you and you know,</v>

1213
00:44:17.810 --> 00:44:21.320
<v Speaker 2>he was just some misbehaved like two year old.</v>

1214
00:44:21.350 --> 00:44:24.080
<v Speaker 2>And then he rewarded for it and reinforced.</v>

1215
00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:24.810
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1216
00:44:24.810 --> 00:44:24.951
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1217
00:44:24.951 --> 00:44:29.951
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that we could hypothesize is that's not a good way to be a</v>

1218
00:44:30.201 --> 00:44:35.201
<v Speaker 2>good to be good parents for that matter is that in some manner he was damaging</v>

1219
00:44:35.551 --> 00:44:38.130
<v Speaker 2>his son and so,</v>

1220
00:44:38.170 --> 00:44:39.900
<v Speaker 2>and he paid for it.</v>

1221
00:44:39.901 --> 00:44:41.920
<v Speaker 2>It's like I didn't know the guy a bad dude.</v>

1222
00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:46.020
<v Speaker 2>I watched how he conducted himself of the chickens eventually came home to roost</v>

1223
00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:47.370
<v Speaker 2>as they inevitably do.</v>

1224
00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:48.360
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1225
00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:49.191
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1226
00:44:49.191 --> 00:44:51.240
<v Speaker 2>and so we'll keeps put what was the problem here?</v>

1227
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:51.871
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1228
00:44:51.871 --> 00:44:52.010
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1229
00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:53.580
<v Speaker 2>it's not so easy to take apart.</v>

1230
00:44:53.581 --> 00:44:55.290
<v Speaker 2>So think about his son was,</v>

1231
00:44:55.291 --> 00:44:57.150
<v Speaker 2>he was the best player on the team.</v>

1232
00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:58.501
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>

1233
00:44:58.501 --> 00:45:01.320
<v Speaker 2>he's trying to win the game because that's what you're supposed to do is</v>

1234
00:45:01.321 --> 00:45:01.621
<v Speaker 2>trigger.</v>

1235
00:45:01.621 --> 00:45:02.454
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

1236
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:04.450
<v Speaker 2>if you're the best hockey player in the teapot,</v>

1237
00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:05.940
<v Speaker 2>that's a kind of victory,</v>

1238
00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:06.840
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1239
00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:07.950
<v Speaker 2>And if you're trying to win,</v>

1240
00:45:07.951 --> 00:45:09.150
<v Speaker 2>well that's what you should be doing.</v>

1241
00:45:09.151 --> 00:45:09.760
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't,</v>

1242
00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:10.380
<v Speaker 2>we have it.</v>

1243
00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:12.270
<v Speaker 2>Why not be upset about it?</v>

1244
00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:13.531
<v Speaker 2>Because after all,</v>

1245
00:45:13.531 --> 00:45:14.970
<v Speaker 2>what you're trying to do is win.</v>

1246
00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:16.320
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1247
00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:17.040
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1248
00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:18.180
<v Speaker 2>but you know all of them.</v>

1249
00:45:18.181 --> 00:45:18.550
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1250
00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:19.890
<v Speaker 2>we've know what your weaker moments,</v>

1251
00:45:19.891 --> 00:45:22.020
<v Speaker 2>you might act like that kid's father,</v>

1252
00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:22.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1253
00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:24.480
<v Speaker 2>you know that that's not good.</v>

1254
00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:25.590
<v Speaker 2>So why,</v>

1255
00:45:25.890 --> 00:45:26.520
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>

1256
00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:27.960
<v Speaker 2>what exactly is going on?</v>

1257
00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:29.940
<v Speaker 2>And you might say to your kid,</v>

1258
00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:30.781
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1259
00:45:30.781 --> 00:45:33.300
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter whether you win or lose your kindness over,</v>

1260
00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:34.260
<v Speaker 2>played the game.</v>

1261
00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:36.240
<v Speaker 2>And your kid thinks,</v>

1262
00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:39.060
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean by that?</v>

1263
00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:41.003
<v Speaker 2>And you say,</v>

1264
00:45:41.610 --> 00:45:41.851
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1265
00:45:41.851 --> 00:45:42.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1266
00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:48.150
<v Speaker 2>but it's the right way to behave.</v>

1267
00:45:49.350 --> 00:45:49.891
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

1268
00:45:49.891 --> 00:45:50.101
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1269
00:45:50.101 --> 00:45:50.671
<v Speaker 2>you don't know,</v>

1270
00:45:50.671 --> 00:45:52.200
<v Speaker 2>but it is the right way to behave.</v>

1271
00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:55.770
<v Speaker 2>And so I can tell you why it's the right way to behave and think.</v>

1272
00:45:56.490 --> 00:45:59.030
<v Speaker 2>And so it just goes along with just chapter five.</v>

1273
00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:01.860
<v Speaker 2>But that your children do anything that makes you just like so,</v>

1274
00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:03.360
<v Speaker 2>so imagine this.</v>

1275
00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:08.010
<v Speaker 2>So what is it exactly that you're trying to do when you want your kid to win?</v>

1276
00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:09.571
<v Speaker 2>That's first of all,</v>

1277
00:46:09.571 --> 00:46:13.190
<v Speaker 2>you got to think about what do you need by when we were in decided to do,</v>

1278
00:46:13.191 --> 00:46:14.780
<v Speaker 2>you don't need stomp your entity,</v>

1279
00:46:14.781 --> 00:46:19.230
<v Speaker 2>a team to nothing on in the hockey arena because there's something about that.</v>

1280
00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:21.030
<v Speaker 2>It's just not exactly right.</v>

1281
00:46:21.210 --> 00:46:21.541
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1282
00:46:21.541 --> 00:46:22.374
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1283
00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:22.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1284
00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:25.080
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean give me win this game?</v>

1285
00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:26.581
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1286
00:46:26.581 --> 00:46:26.821
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1287
00:46:26.821 --> 00:46:31.200
<v Speaker 2>you don't exactly mean that because life is APP game,</v>

1288
00:46:32.250 --> 00:46:33.083
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1289
00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:38.240
<v Speaker 2>It's a sequence of kings and probably that it's a secrets of different games,</v>

1290
00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:39.301
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1291
00:46:39.301 --> 00:46:41.370
<v Speaker 2>And realizing that you're going to be a pro hockey player,</v>

1292
00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:42.570
<v Speaker 2>just you're not,</v>

1293
00:46:42.571 --> 00:46:44.850
<v Speaker 2>so you might as well just give up go hat cause it's,</v>

1294
00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:45.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1295
00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:46.200
<v Speaker 2>it's just not going to happen.</v>

1296
00:46:46.201 --> 00:46:47.700
<v Speaker 2>But even if it does happen,</v>

1297
00:46:47.701 --> 00:46:49.530
<v Speaker 2>it's still a sequence of games.</v>

1298
00:46:49.531 --> 00:46:50.490
<v Speaker 2>It's not one thing.</v>

1299
00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:51.620
<v Speaker 2>It's a sequence of change.</v>

1300
00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:53.670
<v Speaker 2>But if you're a typical person,</v>

1301
00:46:53.730 --> 00:46:55.560
<v Speaker 2>and even if you're a pro hockey player,</v>

1302
00:46:55.800 --> 00:47:00.330
<v Speaker 2>hockey is just one of the many games you come into play and you're going to play</v>

1303
00:47:00.331 --> 00:47:03.780
<v Speaker 2>those games with the same people often over and over and over and over.</v>

1304
00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:05.010
<v Speaker 2>And so then you might say,</v>

1305
00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:10.040
<v Speaker 2>well the rules that govern the probability that you'll win a set of games isn't</v>

1306
00:47:12.541 --> 00:47:17.460
<v Speaker 2>the same as the rule that governs whether or not you would one of you should</v>

1307
00:47:17.461 --> 00:47:22.461
<v Speaker 2>never compromise your ability to prevail in a set of games for the purpose of</v>

1308
00:47:25.171 --> 00:47:26.610
<v Speaker 2>winning a single game.</v>

1309
00:47:27.210 --> 00:47:30.640
<v Speaker 2>And so when you tell a kid should be a good sport,</v>

1310
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:31.543
<v Speaker 2>Kevin,</v>

1311
00:47:31.810 --> 00:47:32.790
<v Speaker 2>what you're saying is</v>

1312
00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:38.020
<v Speaker 2>that was the game has a sequel haven has some important,</v>

1313
00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:41.170
<v Speaker 2>it's up to you to try and win cause you don't find the playbooks as he tried to</v>

1314
00:47:41.171 --> 00:47:41.620
<v Speaker 2>win.</v>

1315
00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:46.620
<v Speaker 2>But this case is only part of a much bigger thing and you're not trying to win</v>

1316
00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:51.220
<v Speaker 2>in this at the cost of the much bigger thing.</v>

1317
00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:53.020
<v Speaker 2>That would be foolish.</v>

1318
00:47:53.250 --> 00:47:57.640
<v Speaker 2>And so what you actually want to do is conduct yourself in the game in a variety</v>

1319
00:47:57.641 --> 00:48:01.270
<v Speaker 2>of ways that maximizes the value of the whole set.</v>

1320
00:48:01.271 --> 00:48:01.781
<v Speaker 2>So you might say,</v>

1321
00:48:01.781 --> 00:48:06.781
<v Speaker 2>well let's say you're on a team passed the damn pot now and then why?</v>

1322
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:07.121
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1323
00:48:07.121 --> 00:48:11.410
<v Speaker 2>cause you thought teammates and maybe your whole team would be better to help</v>

1324
00:48:11.411 --> 00:48:12.580
<v Speaker 2>develop them.</v>

1325
00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:13.221
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1326
00:48:13.221 --> 00:48:15.040
<v Speaker 2>and maybe you could be the star,</v>

1327
00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:17.050
<v Speaker 2>you should try to be the best player on the team,</v>

1328
00:48:17.051 --> 00:48:19.420
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time she did it the whole team better.</v>

1329
00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:20.350
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

1330
00:48:20.351 --> 00:48:25.120
<v Speaker 2>spend 30% of your time passing the damn park to 700 kid.</v>

1331
00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:25.811
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1332
00:48:25.811 --> 00:48:26.470
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

1333
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:27.010
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1334
00:48:27.010 --> 00:48:27.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1335
00:48:27.370 --> 00:48:31.840
<v Speaker 2>that's also gonna show the other kids that year or someone who's worthy of,</v>

1336
00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:32.620
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1337
00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:34.420
<v Speaker 2>of being on the team.</v>

1338
00:48:34.421 --> 00:48:37.840
<v Speaker 2>That's a really important thing because you're going to be on the load of teams</v>

1339
00:48:37.841 --> 00:48:40.150
<v Speaker 2>and then as well,</v>

1340
00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:44.430
<v Speaker 2>if you conduct yourself properly while you're playing the game and people</v>

1341
00:48:44.450 --> 00:48:45.010
<v Speaker 2>observe them,</v>

1342
00:48:45.010 --> 00:48:47.740
<v Speaker 2>then they're going to invite you to play a bunch of other games.</v>

1343
00:48:47.830 --> 00:48:49.840
<v Speaker 2>And that's really what we want for your kids at school.</v>

1344
00:48:49.841 --> 00:48:50.140
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1345
00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:50.973
<v Speaker 2>If you think about it,</v>

1346
00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:54.520
<v Speaker 2>you don't want them to be the best at a game.</v>

1347
00:48:54.550 --> 00:48:58.810
<v Speaker 2>You want the probability that people will invite them throughout their life to</v>

1348
00:48:58.811 --> 00:49:03.670
<v Speaker 2>play in a whole series of interesting games to be absolutely maximized because</v>

1349
00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:08.440
<v Speaker 2>then they'd never lacked opportunity that think the whole world opens itself up</v>

1350
00:49:08.441 --> 00:49:08.680
<v Speaker 2>to them.</v>

1351
00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:13.680
<v Speaker 2>It's so what you're saying when you say it doesn't have a human or lose it</v>

1352
00:49:13.851 --> 00:49:18.370
<v Speaker 2>matters how you played the game is conduct yourself so that you have the highest</v>

1353
00:49:18.371 --> 00:49:20.350
<v Speaker 2>probability of preventative cross,</v>

1354
00:49:20.351 --> 00:49:22.330
<v Speaker 2>the whitest possible set of gauge.</v>

1355
00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:26.290
<v Speaker 2>And there's an ethic there and there's a real ethic there.</v>

1356
00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:31.350
<v Speaker 2>It's real because it is really the case that life is a set of games,</v>

1357
00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:31.541
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1358
00:49:31.541 --> 00:49:32.660
<v Speaker 2>a very large set of the cage.</v>

1359
00:49:32.661 --> 00:49:36.820
<v Speaker 2>And it really is the case that there's a way of playing a set of gauge that</v>

1360
00:49:36.821 --> 00:49:41.230
<v Speaker 2>maximizes the probability that you'll be successful at the largest number of</v>

1361
00:49:41.231 --> 00:49:42.064
<v Speaker 2>games.</v>

1362
00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:42.970
<v Speaker 2>And it's very,</v>

1363
00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:44.950
<v Speaker 2>it's a very sophisticated ethic.</v>

1364
00:49:44.951 --> 00:49:45.520
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1365
00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:47.800
<v Speaker 2>and so I think I can develop that a little bit.</v>

1366
00:49:47.801 --> 00:49:50.860
<v Speaker 2>It's like now you're trying to figure out how to conduct yourself in the world</v>

1367
00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:53.950
<v Speaker 2>are going back to what's the outside of the value structure.</v>

1368
00:49:53.950 --> 00:49:55.360
<v Speaker 2>How are you going to be a good parent?</v>

1369
00:49:55.570 --> 00:49:58.210
<v Speaker 2>You're going to teach your kid how to play properly world.</v>

1370
00:49:58.270 --> 00:50:00.850
<v Speaker 2>You have to know how to play properly in the world to do that.</v>

1371
00:50:00.851 --> 00:50:02.110
<v Speaker 2>So that's going to go along with it.</v>

1372
00:50:02.111 --> 00:50:02.944
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1373
00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:04.690
<v Speaker 2>well I'll,</v>

1374
00:50:04.691 --> 00:50:07.360
<v Speaker 2>how else might that outside,</v>

1375
00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:08.313
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1376
00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:09.500
<v Speaker 2>ethical structure,</v>

1377
00:50:09.501 --> 00:50:11.080
<v Speaker 2>the parameterize that say,</v>

1378
00:50:11.110 --> 00:50:16.110
<v Speaker 2>well you want to play the game so that you take care of yourself because you</v>

1379
00:50:16.421 --> 00:50:19.690
<v Speaker 2>need to take care of herself or someone else has doing doesn't seem like a great</v>

1380
00:50:19.691 --> 00:50:20.290
<v Speaker 2>deal.</v>

1381
00:50:20.290 --> 00:50:22.660
<v Speaker 2>So you have to take care of yourself and that's hard.</v>

1382
00:50:22.661 --> 00:50:22.901
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1383
00:50:22.901 --> 00:50:27.070
<v Speaker 2>there's things you need your complicated thing to propagate across time,</v>

1384
00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:27.771
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1385
00:50:27.771 --> 00:50:29.030
<v Speaker 2>So you have to take care of yourself,</v>

1386
00:50:29.031 --> 00:50:32.510
<v Speaker 2>but you have to take care of yourself in a way that works today.</v>

1387
00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:35.030
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't interfere with tomorrow.</v>

1388
00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:38.510
<v Speaker 2>And so the today and tomorrow don't interfere with the next week.</v>

1389
00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:39.321
<v Speaker 2>And so today,</v>

1390
00:50:39.321 --> 00:50:43.100
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow and next week don't interfere with next month and next year.</v>

1391
00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:45.230
<v Speaker 2>Cause you're not just taking care of yourself,</v>

1392
00:50:45.231 --> 00:50:49.250
<v Speaker 2>you're taking care of the set of your possible future selves.</v>

1393
00:50:49.310 --> 00:50:52.010
<v Speaker 2>And that's way more complicated and difficult.</v>

1394
00:50:52.070 --> 00:50:54.730
<v Speaker 2>And so you're parameterizing what you have to do.</v>

1395
00:50:54.731 --> 00:50:54.900
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

1396
00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:55.890
<v Speaker 2>there's an ethic Amanda,</v>

1397
00:50:55.920 --> 00:51:00.920
<v Speaker 2>but it's more stringent than map because no man is an island this,</v>

1398
00:51:01.131 --> 00:51:01.731
<v Speaker 2>they say it.</v>

1399
00:51:01.731 --> 00:51:04.520
<v Speaker 2>So it isn't that you just have to take care of yourself,</v>

1400
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:08.810
<v Speaker 2>take care of yourself and your family and you have to do that in a way so that</v>

1401
00:51:08.811 --> 00:51:10.790
<v Speaker 2>there's no interference between the two of you.</v>

1402
00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:13.370
<v Speaker 2>And so that it propagates across time.</v>

1403
00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:15.020
<v Speaker 2>So that's really difficult.</v>

1404
00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:18.170
<v Speaker 2>And then you have take care of yourself and your family in a way that absolutely</v>

1405
00:51:18.171 --> 00:51:19.970
<v Speaker 2>benefits the community.</v>

1406
00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:21.580
<v Speaker 2>And so that,</v>

1407
00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:23.330
<v Speaker 2>that makes it even harder.</v>

1408
00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:27.710
<v Speaker 2>And if there's no reason not to aim it out because we'd be talking about what it</v>

1409
00:51:27.711 --> 00:51:28.880
<v Speaker 2>is that you should aim at,</v>

1410
00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:29.361
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1411
00:51:29.361 --> 00:51:33.860
<v Speaker 2>well you might as well aim at that because there wasn't anything better that you</v>

1412
00:51:33.861 --> 00:51:34.760
<v Speaker 2>put a mat.</v>

1413
00:51:34.940 --> 00:51:36.890
<v Speaker 2>And we already decided that piece to some degree,</v>

1414
00:51:36.891 --> 00:51:40.830
<v Speaker 2>that the way the world manifests itself to you is dependent on what you,</v>

1415
00:51:40.831 --> 00:51:44.000
<v Speaker 2>a map and then you should aim at the best possible vein.</v>

1416
00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:47.330
<v Speaker 2>And so now we're trying to figure out what the best possible thing is.</v>

1417
00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:48.780
<v Speaker 2>There's a hypothesis there too,</v>

1418
00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:53.800
<v Speaker 2>which is the more you're willing to aim at the best possible fame,</v>

1419
00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:57.860
<v Speaker 2>the better the world that reveals itself to you is,</v>

1420
00:51:58.370 --> 00:51:58.731
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1421
00:51:58.731 --> 00:51:59.001
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1422
00:51:59.001 --> 00:51:59.900
<v Speaker 2>you kind of one of that,</v>

1423
00:51:59.930 --> 00:52:01.760
<v Speaker 2>I think you kind of know that already.</v>

1424
00:52:01.850 --> 00:52:04.640
<v Speaker 2>I would say part of the reason you know that implicitly,</v>

1425
00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:07.610
<v Speaker 2>you know that in the same way that you admire someone who's,</v>

1426
00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:09.230
<v Speaker 2>who's a good sport,</v>

1427
00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:10.490
<v Speaker 2>because you are,</v>

1428
00:52:10.490 --> 00:52:12.170
<v Speaker 2>that even if you watch pro,</v>

1429
00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:13.310
<v Speaker 2>if you watch pro sports,</v>

1430
00:52:13.311 --> 00:52:15.260
<v Speaker 2>of course inspiring people with skills,</v>

1431
00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:18.080
<v Speaker 2>there's no doubt about that and you should because they're supposed to develop</v>

1432
00:52:18.081 --> 00:52:18.914
<v Speaker 2>their skills.</v>

1433
00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:21.870
<v Speaker 2>But the athlete who's top form and who's,</v>

1434
00:52:21.871 --> 00:52:22.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1435
00:52:22.130 --> 00:52:22.341
<v Speaker 2>who's,</v>

1436
00:52:22.341 --> 00:52:22.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1437
00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:23.061
<v Speaker 2>who's,</v>

1438
00:52:23.061 --> 00:52:23.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1439
00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:24.320
<v Speaker 2>what would you say?</v>

1440
00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:25.700
<v Speaker 2>Who's a mature,</v>

1441
00:52:25.701 --> 00:52:30.320
<v Speaker 2>an honorable player that goes to the people that shine above everyone else.</v>

1442
00:52:30.321 --> 00:52:31.080
<v Speaker 2>They have the skill,</v>

1443
00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:34.720
<v Speaker 2>but they have the nobility of character and you put those two things together</v>

1444
00:52:34.721 --> 00:52:35.061
<v Speaker 2>and you think,</v>

1445
00:52:35.061 --> 00:52:35.894
<v Speaker 2>well there's an APP.</v>

1446
00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:39.410
<v Speaker 2>There was a role model for young people as well,</v>

1447
00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:41.370
<v Speaker 2>so it's not just that they could play the game,</v>

1448
00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:42.050
<v Speaker 2>suffer badly.</v>

1449
00:52:42.050 --> 00:52:46.520
<v Speaker 2>Although the candidates that they blame the set of getting suffered and you</v>

1450
00:52:46.521 --> 00:52:46.671
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1451
00:52:46.671 --> 00:52:51.671
<v Speaker 2>you see that an athlete too who have a real well real stellar reputation,</v>

1452
00:52:52.041 --> 00:52:56.200
<v Speaker 2>let's say stellar like a star because that infers to starve course to start with</v>

1453
00:52:56.201 --> 00:53:00.860
<v Speaker 2>something that you have to lift up your eyes above the earth to see it,</v>

1454
00:53:00.861 --> 00:53:01.251
<v Speaker 2>to look.</v>

1455
00:53:01.251 --> 00:53:05.390
<v Speaker 2>I want it to have it into a transcendent space into something that twinkles in</v>

1456
00:53:05.391 --> 00:53:09.800
<v Speaker 2>the dark with the source of light to all of that managed is part of what you use</v>

1457
00:53:09.801 --> 00:53:14.210
<v Speaker 2>when you describe someone as a star and it's because you know placidly that</v>

1458
00:53:14.211 --> 00:53:15.530
<v Speaker 2>they're acting off his ethic.</v>

1459
00:53:15.530 --> 00:53:18.410
<v Speaker 2>That's part and parcel hopes at the world's straight.</v>

1460
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:21.650
<v Speaker 2>So soul.</v>

1461
00:53:21.890 --> 00:53:23.180
<v Speaker 2>That's quite remarkable.</v>

1462
00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:24.050
<v Speaker 2>That's all equipment.</v>

1463
00:53:24.050 --> 00:53:26.170
<v Speaker 2>I think this is like me.</v>

1464
00:53:26.610 --> 00:53:30.240
<v Speaker 2>It's all standards at least to some degree out of the gorilla experiment,</v>

1465
00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:31.100
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1466
00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:31.933
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1467
00:53:32.370 --> 00:53:34.270
<v Speaker 2>why is it that you saw what you saw?</v>

1468
00:53:34.310 --> 00:53:35.580
<v Speaker 2>It depends on what you mean now.</v>

1469
00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:36.331
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1470
00:53:36.331 --> 00:53:37.164
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1471
00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:41.070
<v Speaker 2>now that we've started figuring out that what we see and what we emotionally</v>

1472
00:53:41.071 --> 00:53:43.470
<v Speaker 2>experiences associated with what we aim at,</v>

1473
00:53:43.471 --> 00:53:46.920
<v Speaker 2>that we can start figuring out just exactly what we should email.</v>

1474
00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:51.240
<v Speaker 2>And so here's the kind of thought and I think it's a worthwhile one.</v>

1475
00:53:51.241 --> 00:53:52.110
<v Speaker 2>We'll do two things.</v>

1476
00:53:52.111 --> 00:53:53.670
<v Speaker 2>Well before this fight,</v>

1477
00:53:57.130 --> 00:53:59.370
<v Speaker 2>I didn't talk about how you can get your aim street.</v>

1478
00:54:01.590 --> 00:54:02.423
<v Speaker 2>Here's disappears.</v>

1479
00:54:03.370 --> 00:54:07.660
<v Speaker 2>So I thought a lot about the idea of meaning in life.</v>

1480
00:54:08.020 --> 00:54:08.710
<v Speaker 2>I wrote,</v>

1481
00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:10.720
<v Speaker 2>the first book I wrote was called maps of meaning.</v>

1482
00:54:10.721 --> 00:54:11.291
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1483
00:54:11.291 --> 00:54:14.410
<v Speaker 2>There was an attempt to lay out the structure,</v>

1484
00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:17.170
<v Speaker 2>meaning as soon as that such a thing existed,</v>

1485
00:54:17.460 --> 00:54:18.293
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1486
00:54:18.550 --> 00:54:21.810
<v Speaker 2>I derived some propositions as a consequences of writing that book.</v>

1487
00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:22.990
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1488
00:54:22.990 --> 00:54:24.190
<v Speaker 2>it's a very serious book.</v>

1489
00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:26.340
<v Speaker 2>It's all in audio form now.</v>

1490
00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:28.780
<v Speaker 2>Casey Richards did it came out about three days ago.</v>

1491
00:54:28.850 --> 00:54:30.240
<v Speaker 2>So it's a hard book,</v>

1492
00:54:30.241 --> 00:54:32.930
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's a lot easier to understand it.</v>

1493
00:54:32.950 --> 00:54:37.950
<v Speaker 2>It's spoken form because I could adequate proper intonations to the complex</v>

1494
00:54:38.891 --> 00:54:41.050
<v Speaker 2>sentences and Abimelech due to the,</v>

1495
00:54:41.110 --> 00:54:45.370
<v Speaker 2>to the right and so if you like 12 rules for life and if you're interested in</v>

1496
00:54:45.371 --> 00:54:47.080
<v Speaker 2>what I'm talking about tonight,</v>

1497
00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:49.180
<v Speaker 2>then you can give it a shot.</v>

1498
00:54:49.390 --> 00:54:50.830
<v Speaker 2>It's about 50 hours long.</v>

1499
00:54:50.831 --> 00:54:53.140
<v Speaker 2>I think that anything in the spoken for form,</v>

1500
00:54:53.530 --> 00:54:54.670
<v Speaker 2>so it's very demanding.</v>

1501
00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:57.730
<v Speaker 2>It'll take you places that are very much worth going.</v>

1502
00:54:58.060 --> 00:54:58.893
<v Speaker 2>Seriously,</v>

1503
00:54:59.230 --> 00:54:59.840
<v Speaker 2>please.</v>

1504
00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:00.390
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

1505
00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:03.790
<v Speaker 2>they picked very much what's going on as far as I'm concerned.</v>

1506
00:55:04.090 --> 00:55:07.530
<v Speaker 2>I'd be basing the lectures that I'd be doing it for 30 years on that book and</v>

1507
00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:11.570
<v Speaker 2>the people that I brought along on the journey that constitutes the lecture and</v>

1508
00:55:11.571 --> 00:55:13.720
<v Speaker 2>seek to think that it's worthwhile as well.</v>

1509
00:55:13.870 --> 00:55:15.940
<v Speaker 2>So you could give it a shot and it's a study.</v>

1510
00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:17.890
<v Speaker 2>It's a study of the meeting.</v>

1511
00:55:17.950 --> 00:55:20.190
<v Speaker 2>There's a set of propositions in bedded in it.</v>

1512
00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:27.700
<v Speaker 2>One of the propositions is that life is intrinsically and erratic,</v>

1513
00:55:27.701 --> 00:55:29.320
<v Speaker 2>deeply meaningful,</v>

1514
00:55:29.350 --> 00:55:32.830
<v Speaker 2>but the ineradicable meaning is negative.</v>

1515
00:55:33.330 --> 00:55:36.670
<v Speaker 2>Like the suffering people are limited it mortal.</v>

1516
00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:38.560
<v Speaker 2>We all die like this.</v>

1517
00:55:38.590 --> 00:55:43.300
<v Speaker 2>Like let's go to a tragic element that there's no arguing your cell of,</v>

1518
00:55:43.690 --> 00:55:48.690
<v Speaker 2>and so when people say is life meaningful that it's what they need because the</v>

1519
00:55:48.761 --> 00:55:52.750
<v Speaker 2>negative part of life is right there and you're going to experience it whether</v>

1520
00:55:52.751 --> 00:55:53.960
<v Speaker 2>you believe it or not,</v>

1521
00:55:53.970 --> 00:55:56.020
<v Speaker 2>when you're stepping into a meeting or not,</v>

1522
00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:59.890
<v Speaker 2>that's nothing to do with whether or not you're going to suffer pain and be</v>

1523
00:55:59.891 --> 00:56:00.850
<v Speaker 2>anxious.</v>

1524
00:56:01.070 --> 00:56:06.070
<v Speaker 2>That's going to happen regardless of your rationalizations and so you're stuck</v>

1525
00:56:06.731 --> 00:56:11.731
<v Speaker 2>with that and you could consider that some sense of a fundamental reality.</v>

1526
00:56:11.970 --> 00:56:16.970
<v Speaker 2>And I would say most transcendent religious systems make exactly that claim.</v>

1527
00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:23.050
<v Speaker 2>So Judaism of course concentrates on the trash the past.</v>

1528
00:56:23.250 --> 00:56:27.940
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm going to say he says all these religious systems concentrate on one of</v>

1529
00:56:27.941 --> 00:56:30.670
<v Speaker 2>the first noble truth of Buddhism is that life is suffering.</v>

1530
00:56:30.671 --> 00:56:34.120
<v Speaker 2>And then of course there's Christianity and you are all familiar with the</v>

1531
00:56:34.121 --> 00:56:37.510
<v Speaker 2>central symbolic figure in Christianity,</v>

1532
00:56:37.511 --> 00:56:38.860
<v Speaker 2>which is the crucifix,</v>

1533
00:56:38.861 --> 00:56:42.010
<v Speaker 2>which is if that is the representation of suffering,</v>

1534
00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:46.360
<v Speaker 2>then then you're not paying attention to the religion because that's obviously</v>

1535
00:56:46.361 --> 00:56:47.140
<v Speaker 2>what it is.</v>

1536
00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:47.621
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

1537
00:56:47.621 --> 00:56:52.090
<v Speaker 2>it's the worst time of suffering because here's the worst time of suffering.</v>

1538
00:56:52.250 --> 00:56:53.320
<v Speaker 2>He saw her physically,</v>

1539
00:56:53.330 --> 00:56:54.160
<v Speaker 2>mentally,</v>

1540
00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:54.940
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1541
00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:59.200
<v Speaker 2>but the reason you suffer is because people be traded you and they'd be training</v>

1542
00:56:59.201 --> 00:57:01.410
<v Speaker 2>despite the fact that you're in this.</v>

1543
00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:05.350
<v Speaker 2>So it probably is it suffering is the worst suffering,</v>

1544
00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:07.420
<v Speaker 2>which makes it architectural in some sense.</v>

1545
00:57:07.421 --> 00:57:10.330
<v Speaker 2>It makes it a kind of suffering that can't be exceeded.</v>

1546
00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:12.580
<v Speaker 2>So that that's why that simple has such,</v>

1547
00:57:12.581 --> 00:57:15.760
<v Speaker 2>it's one of many reasons that that symbol has such power.</v>

1548
00:57:15.850 --> 00:57:16.061
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1549
00:57:16.061 --> 00:57:16.361
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1550
00:57:16.361 --> 00:57:17.650
<v Speaker 2>so that's the bottle of wine.</v>

1551
00:57:17.651 --> 00:57:20.560
<v Speaker 2>That's the baseline structure of reality.</v>

1552
00:57:20.561 --> 00:57:21.394
<v Speaker 2>Let's say.</v>

1553
00:57:21.490 --> 00:57:21.880
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

1554
00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:23.470
<v Speaker 2>that's so pessimistic.</v>

1555
00:57:23.471 --> 00:57:24.070
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1556
00:57:24.070 --> 00:57:24.431
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1557
00:57:24.431 --> 00:57:25.264
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>

1558
00:57:25.450 --> 00:57:27.160
<v Speaker 2>But what is it is,</v>

1559
00:57:27.161 --> 00:57:28.720
<v Speaker 2>it's unbelievable to be pessimistic,</v>

1560
00:57:28.721 --> 00:57:29.300
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1561
00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:34.300
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is is that you can't get to what you need to get to until you get</v>

1562
00:57:35.171 --> 00:57:36.910
<v Speaker 2>to what you can barely tolerate.</v>

1563
00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:38.680
<v Speaker 2>That's a good way of thinking about it.</v>

1564
00:57:38.681 --> 00:57:39.520
<v Speaker 2>And you all know,</v>

1565
00:57:39.521 --> 00:57:43.330
<v Speaker 2>and I think part of the reasons perhaps that you're here is because I'd be</v>

1566
00:57:43.331 --> 00:57:45.910
<v Speaker 2>talking about these sorts of things in my lectures and my books,</v>

1567
00:57:45.911 --> 00:57:50.510
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not trying to pull any punches like I do believe that everyone knows</v>

1568
00:57:50.790 --> 00:57:53.590
<v Speaker 2>that the claim that life is suffering,</v>

1569
00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:57.640
<v Speaker 2>and then it's tainted by malevolence by the way in which even makes it worse,</v>

1570
00:57:57.641 --> 00:57:58.210
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1571
00:57:58.210 --> 00:57:59.260
<v Speaker 2>It's not just suffering.</v>

1572
00:57:59.261 --> 00:58:01.480
<v Speaker 2>It's not just the fact that life is tragic,</v>

1573
00:58:01.580 --> 00:58:03.100
<v Speaker 2>that's bad enough,</v>

1574
00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:06.040
<v Speaker 2>but it's made worse by the fact that no matter how bad things are,</v>

1575
00:58:06.041 --> 00:58:08.470
<v Speaker 2>or you can do something stupid to make them worse,</v>

1576
00:58:08.530 --> 00:58:13.530
<v Speaker 2>and he probably not only will it have you all know that because you know,</v>

1577
00:58:13.950 --> 00:58:16.180
<v Speaker 2>you know perfectly well that when you're miserable,</v>

1578
00:58:16.690 --> 00:58:16.961
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1579
00:58:16.961 --> 00:58:20.860
<v Speaker 2>I know terrible things could just sort of happen randomly and I understand that</v>

1580
00:58:20.861 --> 00:58:21.730
<v Speaker 2>perfectly well,</v>

1581
00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:25.340
<v Speaker 2>but you also know that many of the most miserable moments in your life,</v>

1582
00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:26.890
<v Speaker 2>no doubt there is many of them.</v>

1583
00:58:27.210 --> 00:58:30.190
<v Speaker 2>You are accompanied by this sense that you knew bloody well when you were</v>

1584
00:58:30.191 --> 00:58:30.791
<v Speaker 2>getting into it.</v>

1585
00:58:30.791 --> 00:58:32.320
<v Speaker 2>You weren't smart enough to stop it.</v>

1586
00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:37.380
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe you even facilitated or maybe facilitated knowing that suffering was</v>

1587
00:58:37.511 --> 00:58:37.841
<v Speaker 2>going to be,</v>

1588
00:58:37.841 --> 00:58:38.650
<v Speaker 2>they'll come and say,</v>

1589
00:58:38.650 --> 00:58:39.401
<v Speaker 2>well to hell with it,</v>

1590
00:58:39.401 --> 00:58:40.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do it anyways.</v>

1591
00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:41.620
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1592
00:58:41.620 --> 00:58:42.191
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1593
00:58:42.191 --> 00:58:45.800
<v Speaker 2>or maybe it'd be betrayed by someone cause that happens very often and maybe</v>

1594
00:58:45.801 --> 00:58:47.110
<v Speaker 2>you'd be traded some honor.</v>

1595
00:58:47.170 --> 00:58:51.400
<v Speaker 2>You aren't deceitfully or immorally by your own moral standards by the way.</v>

1596
00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:54.310
<v Speaker 2>And so nothing so bad that you can't make it worse.</v>

1597
00:58:54.670 --> 00:58:55.001
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1598
00:58:55.001 --> 00:58:59.470
<v Speaker 2>And so it's not just that life is tragic and it's also touched with malevolence</v>

1599
00:58:59.471 --> 00:59:01.180
<v Speaker 2>and that definitely makes it work.</v>

1600
00:59:01.181 --> 00:59:01.380
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1601
00:59:01.380 --> 00:59:02.860
<v Speaker 2>so that's your starting point.</v>

1602
00:59:03.220 --> 00:59:03.491
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1603
00:59:03.491 --> 00:59:03.851
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1604
00:59:03.851 --> 00:59:04.461
<v Speaker 2>so that's about,</v>

1605
00:59:04.461 --> 00:59:06.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm as pessimistic as it gets.</v>

1606
00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:06.641
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1607
00:59:06.641 --> 00:59:08.740
<v Speaker 2>you do read dealt into that you can look at,</v>

1608
00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:13.980
<v Speaker 2>I studied totalitarian brutality for 40 years I guess in Hawaii and I was</v>

1609
00:59:15.761 --> 00:59:16.720
<v Speaker 2>clinical psychologists,</v>

1610
00:59:16.721 --> 00:59:16.990
<v Speaker 2>just oil.</v>

1611
00:59:16.990 --> 00:59:17.591
<v Speaker 2>I still am.</v>

1612
00:59:17.591 --> 00:59:20.830
<v Speaker 2>But I've done thousands of hours of clinical work and I've seen some pretty</v>

1613
00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:24.920
<v Speaker 2>nasty things of course studies and things that were perhaps even worse.</v>

1614
00:59:24.921 --> 00:59:29.240
<v Speaker 2>And so it is definitely the case that people can make it the mirror tragedy of</v>

1615
00:59:29.241 --> 00:59:29.691
<v Speaker 2>their life.</v>

1616
00:59:29.691 --> 00:59:32.210
<v Speaker 2>And just something very much approximating hell.</v>

1617
00:59:32.270 --> 00:59:35.210
<v Speaker 2>Some of you probably from families have done exactly that.</v>

1618
00:59:35.211 --> 00:59:38.240
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe you're in a family right now that's doing exactly that.</v>

1619
00:59:38.540 --> 00:59:38.811
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1620
00:59:38.811 --> 00:59:41.300
<v Speaker 2>so in that step that takes a bad thing.</v>

1621
00:59:41.310 --> 00:59:42.500
<v Speaker 2>It makes it unbearable.</v>

1622
00:59:42.530 --> 00:59:42.801
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1623
00:59:42.801 --> 00:59:46.460
<v Speaker 2>you've been thinking sometimes matching people around the deathbed that the</v>

1624
00:59:46.461 --> 00:59:47.270
<v Speaker 2>family member,</v>

1625
00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:47.481
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1626
00:59:47.481 --> 00:59:49.880
<v Speaker 2>And there's all sorts of unresolved family conflict.</v>

1627
00:59:49.881 --> 00:59:53.630
<v Speaker 2>And so isn't that not that the person's laying there gasping up their last</v>

1628
00:59:53.631 --> 00:59:54.080
<v Speaker 2>breath,</v>

1629
00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:55.920
<v Speaker 2>but everybody in the room was hostile.</v>

1630
00:59:55.921 --> 00:59:59.600
<v Speaker 2>And let's say they're also arguing because that's certainly a good time to have</v>

1631
00:59:59.601 --> 01:00:01.160
<v Speaker 2>an argument that it certainly happens.</v>

1632
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:01.851
<v Speaker 2>Plenty of it.</v>

1633
01:00:01.851 --> 01:00:05.560
<v Speaker 2>So you can take stuff from that's pretty damn bad and then you could turn it</v>

1634
01:00:05.561 --> 01:00:06.410
<v Speaker 2>into hail.</v>

1635
01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:09.740
<v Speaker 2>And so that's life.</v>

1636
01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:10.641
<v Speaker 2>You think,</v>

1637
01:00:10.641 --> 01:00:12.680
<v Speaker 2>well that's pessimistic.</v>

1638
01:00:12.681 --> 01:00:13.010
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1639
01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:13.843
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1640
01:00:13.850 --> 01:00:16.270
<v Speaker 2>good means we've got to the bottom of things.</v>

1641
01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:18.950
<v Speaker 2>That's a place that you could start building and say,</v>

1642
01:00:18.951 --> 01:00:19.784
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1643
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:20.600
<v Speaker 2>fair enough.</v>

1644
01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:22.790
<v Speaker 2>It's like life could be like that.</v>

1645
01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:26.870
<v Speaker 2>So what that means is that you need a reason to you.</v>

1646
01:00:26.871 --> 01:00:28.970
<v Speaker 2>You need a reason when things aren't good,</v>

1647
01:00:28.971 --> 01:00:30.630
<v Speaker 2>you need a reason to get out of bed in the morning.</v>

1648
01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:35.390
<v Speaker 2>You need a reason to move forward despite the fact that life is essentially</v>

1649
01:00:35.391 --> 01:00:38.810
<v Speaker 2>tragic and it's tainted by malevolence and the question is,</v>

1650
01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:41.810
<v Speaker 2>is there anything that's up sufficient?</v>

1651
01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:43.970
<v Speaker 2>Grand jury I'd say are sufficient.</v>

1652
01:00:43.971 --> 01:00:48.971
<v Speaker 2>Nobility were sufficient solidity to be of the 80 to you when you're facing with</v>

1653
01:00:51.021 --> 01:00:56.021
<v Speaker 2>the tragic malevolence of life and I think the answer to that is yes and that's</v>

1654
01:00:56.991 --> 01:01:01.991
<v Speaker 2>why this isn't pessimistic because if you could pose the worst possible question</v>

1655
01:01:03.590 --> 01:01:06.650
<v Speaker 2>but then you can answer it with the proper answer,</v>

1656
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:08.590
<v Speaker 2>then the question is no longer so bad.</v>

1657
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:08.961
<v Speaker 2>Carl,</v>

1658
01:01:08.961 --> 01:01:12.260
<v Speaker 2>you said instruct holiness in for the tour.</v>

1659
01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:13.131
<v Speaker 2>It's a Latin,</v>

1660
01:01:13.131 --> 01:01:17.390
<v Speaker 2>it means that which you most want and will be followed where you least want to</v>

1661
01:01:17.391 --> 01:01:19.430
<v Speaker 2>look man,</v>

1662
01:01:19.490 --> 01:01:22.890
<v Speaker 2>that's a smart idea and then actually happens to be wavering.</v>

1663
01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.950
<v Speaker 2>Look where your where was easy to look.</v>

1664
01:01:24.951 --> 01:01:26.990
<v Speaker 2>Yours is a book where you want it to look.</v>

1665
01:01:27.110 --> 01:01:31.040
<v Speaker 2>It's time to look where you don't want to look and that's that sweeping for</v>

1666
01:01:31.041 --> 01:01:31.341
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

1667
01:01:31.341 --> 01:01:31.701
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1668
01:01:31.701 --> 01:01:32.240
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1669
01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:35.840
<v Speaker 2>we just look where we don't want to look at this conversation at the darkest</v>

1670
01:01:35.841 --> 01:01:36.531
<v Speaker 2>part of life.</v>

1671
01:01:36.531 --> 01:01:36.891
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1672
01:01:36.891 --> 01:01:37.724
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1673
01:01:38.450 --> 01:01:39.350
<v Speaker 2>are we all do it?</v>

1674
01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:41.780
<v Speaker 2>If that's the fundamental preconditions of life,</v>

1675
01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:42.980
<v Speaker 2>yes it is.</v>

1676
01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:44.090
<v Speaker 2>Are we up to it?</v>

1677
01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:44.631
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1678
01:01:44.631 --> 01:01:47.900
<v Speaker 2>the answer that seems to be yes,</v>

1679
01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:48.860
<v Speaker 2>as a matter of fact,</v>

1680
01:01:48.861 --> 01:01:51.980
<v Speaker 2>but no matter how difficult life is,</v>

1681
01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:53.940
<v Speaker 2>and no matter how tragic the conditions,</v>

1682
01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:58.700
<v Speaker 2>no matter even the fact that it's made worse by the malevolence of the human</v>

1683
01:01:58.701 --> 01:02:03.701
<v Speaker 2>spirit that say we're actually capable of moving forward and prevailing under</v>

1684
01:02:03.771 --> 01:02:05.480
<v Speaker 2>such circumstances with our eyes,</v>

1685
01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:07.100
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

1686
01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:07.700
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1687
01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:12.700
<v Speaker 2>the world reveals itself team in accordance with your aims in the world.</v>

1688
01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:14.300
<v Speaker 2>So I can say,</v>

1689
01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:15.020
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1690
01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:18.780
<v Speaker 2>the world has this proclivity to tilt towards tragedy and malevolence.</v>

1691
01:02:18.940 --> 01:02:20.450
<v Speaker 2>What are you going to do with all the power?</v>

1692
01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:22.211
<v Speaker 2>You need the name.</v>

1693
01:02:22.211 --> 01:02:27.211
<v Speaker 2>But it's so remarkable that acting towards it justifies the catastrophe of your</v>

1694
01:02:29.431 --> 01:02:30.330
<v Speaker 2>existence.</v>

1695
01:02:30.810 --> 01:02:31.141
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1696
01:02:31.141 --> 01:02:32.790
<v Speaker 2>I could put that in pro se form.</v>

1697
01:02:32.791 --> 01:02:34.380
<v Speaker 2>And you all know this is true too.</v>

1698
01:02:34.410 --> 01:02:38.010
<v Speaker 2>You need a reason to get out of bed in the morning when things aren't good.</v>

1699
01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:39.690
<v Speaker 2>And things are in our thing to be good.</v>

1700
01:02:39.691 --> 01:02:40.381
<v Speaker 2>At some point,</v>

1701
01:02:40.381 --> 01:02:41.010
<v Speaker 2>you know you're,</v>

1702
01:02:41.010 --> 01:02:42.660
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be illness in your family.</v>

1703
01:02:42.930 --> 01:02:44.970
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be the collapse of your dreams.</v>

1704
01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.940
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be the pathology of your state is or you're going to,</v>

1705
01:02:47.941 --> 01:02:51.840
<v Speaker 2>you're going to encounter all the vicissitudes of life now just for sure,</v>

1706
01:02:51.841 --> 01:02:54.240
<v Speaker 2>and if your goal is to be happy,</v>

1707
01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:57.450
<v Speaker 2>well that's not going to get you through the rough times.</v>

1708
01:02:57.450 --> 01:03:00.960
<v Speaker 2>That's for sure because you're not going to be happy then and it's precisely</v>

1709
01:03:00.961 --> 01:03:04.530
<v Speaker 2>during the rough times that you need to get through and maybe you can say to</v>

1710
01:03:04.531 --> 01:03:06.030
<v Speaker 2>yourself something like a,</v>

1711
01:03:06.031 --> 01:03:09.670
<v Speaker 2>look what I'm doing instead is pursuing a noble.</v>

1712
01:03:09.671 --> 01:03:13.740
<v Speaker 2>The school like the possibly can see robot going to take care of myself</v>

1713
01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:14.813
<v Speaker 2>properly.</v>

1714
01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:20.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do that in a way if it's a maybe a maximal benefit to my family and</v>

1715
01:03:21.601 --> 01:03:25.140
<v Speaker 2>aren't going to take care of myself and my family in a way that it's a valuable</v>

1716
01:03:25.141 --> 01:03:26.700
<v Speaker 2>benefit to my community.</v>

1717
01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:29.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to take all those things into account simultaneously.</v>

1718
01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:32.940
<v Speaker 2>And the reason I'm going to do that is because I can push back against the</v>

1719
01:03:32.941 --> 01:03:36.270
<v Speaker 2>tragedy of the world and I could constrain these malevolence.</v>

1720
01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:39.360
<v Speaker 2>I can do that in my own heart and I can help the people around and do that.</v>

1721
01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:41.970
<v Speaker 2>And you can in fact do that.</v>

1722
01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:43.950
<v Speaker 2>Certainly you could make it worse.</v>

1723
01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:47.670
<v Speaker 2>That's absolutely undeniable and that's actually a great place to start because</v>

1724
01:03:47.671 --> 01:03:49.440
<v Speaker 2>once you know that you can make it worse.</v>

1725
01:03:49.590 --> 01:03:49.891
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1726
01:03:49.891 --> 01:03:50.281
<v Speaker 2>if these,</v>

1727
01:03:50.281 --> 01:03:53.700
<v Speaker 2>if you could see doing that well Brian,</v>

1728
01:03:53.730 --> 01:03:54.570
<v Speaker 2>well that's something,</v>

1729
01:03:54.571 --> 01:03:55.110
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1730
01:03:55.110 --> 01:03:56.640
<v Speaker 2>Even if you're not moving the world,</v>

1731
01:03:56.670 --> 01:03:58.920
<v Speaker 2>you know extraordinarily rapidly towards Heather do,</v>

1732
01:03:58.921 --> 01:04:02.440
<v Speaker 2>you could move it at least be somewhat quickly away from hell.</v>

1733
01:04:02.441 --> 01:04:03.290
<v Speaker 2>It gets the hell of it.</v>

1734
01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:05.520
<v Speaker 2>You're capable of producing and it's not right.</v>

1735
01:04:05.521 --> 01:04:08.880
<v Speaker 2>That's nothing cause you can cause a lot of trouble.</v>

1736
01:04:08.910 --> 01:04:11.130
<v Speaker 2>You have that firmly within your,</v>

1737
01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:13.380
<v Speaker 2>you have the power to cause a lot of trouble.</v>

1738
01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:16.980
<v Speaker 2>You know that because you probably already caused a lot of trouble now and then</v>

1739
01:04:17.250 --> 01:04:19.560
<v Speaker 2>and so you can at least stop doing that.</v>

1740
01:04:19.710 --> 01:04:24.060
<v Speaker 2>You could see that ability by looking at capacity for destruction,</v>

1741
01:04:24.270 --> 01:04:25.950
<v Speaker 2>you can see what you're capable of.</v>

1742
01:04:26.490 --> 01:04:29.840
<v Speaker 2>And so that should give you some respect for yourself and kind of a perverse</v>

1743
01:04:29.850 --> 01:04:30.600
<v Speaker 2>manner.</v>

1744
01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:33.960
<v Speaker 2>If you're that much of a force for catastrophe and managing what sort of course</v>

1745
01:04:33.961 --> 01:04:35.190
<v Speaker 2>for good you can be,</v>

1746
01:04:35.490 --> 01:04:39.750
<v Speaker 2>you might be enough of a force for good to stand up as a whole arc against the</v>

1747
01:04:39.751 --> 01:04:40.584
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe.</v>

1748
01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:42.150
<v Speaker 2>And I would say,</v>

1749
01:04:43.410 --> 01:04:44.010
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1750
01:04:44.010 --> 01:04:46.650
<v Speaker 2>so all that deep pessimism for me,</v>

1751
01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:51.210
<v Speaker 2>some sense disappears because I do look to people and I think man,</v>

1752
01:04:51.211 --> 01:04:52.021
<v Speaker 2>we got a rough,</v>

1753
01:04:52.021 --> 01:04:55.650
<v Speaker 2>like there's no doubt about it that this is available with tears and we could</v>

1754
01:04:55.651 --> 01:04:57.960
<v Speaker 2>twist it into something that's quite Hellige,</v>

1755
01:04:58.110 --> 01:05:01.650
<v Speaker 2>but there's enough nobility in each of us so that we can actually work against</v>

1756
01:05:01.651 --> 01:05:02.490
<v Speaker 2>that and we can,</v>

1757
01:05:02.780 --> 01:05:04.290
<v Speaker 2>we can make the world less tragic.</v>

1758
01:05:04.291 --> 01:05:07.290
<v Speaker 2>But he said we can definitely make it less bilevel in place.</v>

1759
01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:08.640
<v Speaker 2>And we did work on that,</v>

1760
01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:10.800
<v Speaker 2>like right in our local environments,</v>

1761
01:05:10.801 --> 01:05:11.010
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1762
01:05:11.010 --> 01:05:12.990
<v Speaker 2>We could make our rooms clean and beautiful.</v>

1763
01:05:12.991 --> 01:05:13.824
<v Speaker 2>We can make our,</v>

1764
01:05:13.950 --> 01:05:15.180
<v Speaker 2>our family's pristine.</v>

1765
01:05:15.181 --> 01:05:15.750
<v Speaker 2>We can,</v>

1766
01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:16.950
<v Speaker 2>we can get our age,</v>

1767
01:05:16.990 --> 01:05:17.380
<v Speaker 2>we can,</v>

1768
01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:22.120
<v Speaker 2>we can shut our aim and we can live in their eyes above the horizon aiming for</v>

1769
01:05:22.121 --> 01:05:22.841
<v Speaker 2>what's best.</v>

1770
01:05:22.841 --> 01:05:23.800
<v Speaker 2>We can do that.</v>

1771
01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:26.410
<v Speaker 2>And what's so fascinating about Catholics say,</v>

1772
01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:30.700
<v Speaker 2>well that immediately infuse your life with the kind of positive meaning that</v>

1773
01:05:30.701 --> 01:05:31.371
<v Speaker 2>they will sit down,</v>

1774
01:05:31.371 --> 01:05:32.720
<v Speaker 2>actually sustain the tragedy.</v>

1775
01:05:32.830 --> 01:05:35.560
<v Speaker 2>It's like I've done something worthwhile to do.</v>

1776
01:05:36.030 --> 01:05:36.281
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1777
01:05:36.281 --> 01:05:41.281
<v Speaker 2>nature said he who has a why can bear any how.</v>

1778
01:05:42.690 --> 01:05:44.550
<v Speaker 2>I was like a brilliant phrase.</v>

1779
01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:45.440
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

1780
01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:47.690
<v Speaker 2>one of the things are we doing is traveling.</v>

1781
01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:48.401
<v Speaker 2>Come to me now,</v>

1782
01:05:48.401 --> 01:05:48.611
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1783
01:05:48.611 --> 01:05:51.880
<v Speaker 2>I am here talking to people about exactly this,</v>

1784
01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:53.230
<v Speaker 2>talking to the promote them,</v>

1785
01:05:53.290 --> 01:05:55.810
<v Speaker 2>maximizing their responsibility.</v>

1786
01:05:56.130 --> 01:05:59.810
<v Speaker 2>They will because your life is tragic as authority lay notes.</v>

1787
01:05:59.811 --> 01:06:00.490
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1788
01:06:00.490 --> 01:06:04.570
<v Speaker 2>and so you need a way or viewing that with the richest possible meaning so that</v>

1789
01:06:04.571 --> 01:06:07.630
<v Speaker 2>you don't become corrupted and resentful,</v>

1790
01:06:07.690 --> 01:06:12.550
<v Speaker 2>angry and hostile and cruel and worse as a consequence of the burden that you</v>

1791
01:06:12.551 --> 01:06:14.490
<v Speaker 2>have to bear that's placed upon us.</v>

1792
01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:15.011
<v Speaker 2>But keep it.</v>

1793
01:06:15.011 --> 01:06:17.200
<v Speaker 2>Take that on Roland terror you can take,</v>

1794
01:06:17.201 --> 01:06:17.351
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1795
01:06:17.351 --> 01:06:21.280
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't do absolutely everything I can to make absolutely everything around</v>

1796
01:06:21.281 --> 01:06:26.281
<v Speaker 2>me as good as I could possibly make and not some naive virtue signaling way.</v>

1797
01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:27.940
<v Speaker 2>That is what I need.</v>

1798
01:06:27.970 --> 01:06:29.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean to take this on like this,</v>

1799
01:06:29.411 --> 01:06:33.210
<v Speaker 2>the task of your life and it is the task of let your friend.</v>

1800
01:06:33.550 --> 01:06:34.061
<v Speaker 2>Then you think,</v>

1801
01:06:34.061 --> 01:06:34.690
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1802
01:06:34.690 --> 01:06:35.011
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1803
01:06:35.011 --> 01:06:39.550
<v Speaker 2>What would that make possible in this world of art school were remarkable</v>

1804
01:06:39.551 --> 01:06:40.151
<v Speaker 2>creatures.</v>

1805
01:06:40.151 --> 01:06:40.720
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1806
01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:42.330
<v Speaker 2>we're all in a nice appeal.</v>

1807
01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:43.011
<v Speaker 2>We're on a night,</v>

1808
01:06:43.011 --> 01:06:44.470
<v Speaker 2>South Hill trajectory,</v>

1809
01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:45.120
<v Speaker 2>ethical,</v>

1810
01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:45.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1811
01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:49.450
<v Speaker 2>things all over the world are getting better really quite quickly,</v>

1812
01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:50.710
<v Speaker 2>quite remarkably quickly.</v>

1813
01:06:50.711 --> 01:06:51.011
<v Speaker 2>You didn't know.</v>

1814
01:06:51.011 --> 01:06:54.580
<v Speaker 2>This isn't very well known because of our deep current pessimism.</v>

1815
01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:55.240
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1816
01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:57.240
<v Speaker 2>people are being lifted out of poverty right now,</v>

1817
01:06:57.241 --> 01:07:00.790
<v Speaker 2>running the world and rape is absolutely unprecedented in the history of</v>

1818
01:07:00.791 --> 01:07:01.624
<v Speaker 2>mankind.</v>

1819
01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:02.290
<v Speaker 2>Ha.</v>

1820
01:07:02.290 --> 01:07:06.850
<v Speaker 2>We lifted half the people who were in absolute poverty in the year 2000 we're no</v>

1821
01:07:06.851 --> 01:07:11.150
<v Speaker 2>longer in absolute poverty by the year 2012 that was more than him.</v>

1822
01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:16.260
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] 300,000 a thousand</v>

1823
01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:18.121
<v Speaker 2>people a week.</v>

1824
01:07:18.121 --> 01:07:21.600
<v Speaker 2>Right now or be hooked to the power group and people are getting access to fresh</v>

1825
01:07:21.601 --> 01:07:26.460
<v Speaker 2>water and the unprecedented rate and infant mortality rates are declining</v>

1826
01:07:26.461 --> 01:07:30.460
<v Speaker 2>precipitously all over the world and the world's fastest growing economies are</v>

1827
01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:35.250
<v Speaker 2>in sub Saharan Africa and no one is starving anywhere unless someone is trying</v>

1828
01:07:35.251 --> 01:07:39.180
<v Speaker 2>to start with to death because there's actually enough food for everyone and it</v>

1829
01:07:39.181 --> 01:07:40.890
<v Speaker 2>doesn't look like you're going to run out.</v>

1830
01:07:40.950 --> 01:07:44.820
<v Speaker 2>Our population's going to peak at about 9 billion and we can probably handle</v>

1831
01:07:44.821 --> 01:07:45.150
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1832
01:07:45.150 --> 01:07:48.240
<v Speaker 2>Especially given current growth rates in agricultural production.</v>

1833
01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:49.141
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1834
01:07:49.141 --> 01:07:52.500
<v Speaker 2>it's so we did move into this future that lies in front of us,</v>

1835
01:07:52.530 --> 01:07:55.740
<v Speaker 2>especially with this technological prowess that would be developing.</v>

1836
01:07:55.741 --> 01:07:58.080
<v Speaker 2>That's absolutely remarkable.</v>

1837
01:07:58.440 --> 01:07:59.040
<v Speaker 2>We could,</v>

1838
01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:03.060
<v Speaker 2>we could move into this future and God only knows how much of the actual tragedy</v>

1839
01:08:03.061 --> 01:08:05.110
<v Speaker 2>of life we could push to the back of that.</v>

1840
01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:07.170
<v Speaker 2>How much is the malevolence that corrupts?</v>

1841
01:08:07.171 --> 01:08:08.640
<v Speaker 2>If he could obliterate,</v>

1842
01:08:08.641 --> 01:08:10.650
<v Speaker 2>who knows how good we could make things,</v>

1843
01:08:10.930 --> 01:08:14.040
<v Speaker 2>it would you think what your old bedroom and twisted because life is difficult.</v>

1844
01:08:14.070 --> 01:08:15.570
<v Speaker 2>If he'd betrayed like look,</v>

1845
01:08:15.571 --> 01:08:16.131
<v Speaker 2>fair enough,</v>

1846
01:08:16.131 --> 01:08:16.640
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1847
01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:17.690
<v Speaker 2>Life is difficult.</v>

1848
01:08:17.691 --> 01:08:20.750
<v Speaker 2>And you probably didn't leave the trade and what are you going to do?</v>

1849
01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:22.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna make it worse.</v>

1850
01:08:22.790 --> 01:08:22.911
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1851
01:08:22.911 --> 01:08:24.440
<v Speaker 2>that's not going to get you up in the morning,</v>

1852
01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:24.951
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1853
01:08:24.951 --> 01:08:25.960
<v Speaker 2>That's going to make you want to,</v>

1854
01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:28.340
<v Speaker 2>who knows what that's going to make you want to do.</v>

1855
01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:30.680
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to make you want to do something that's good,</v>

1856
01:08:30.681 --> 01:08:31.550
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>

1857
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:32.840
<v Speaker 2>Instead you can say,</v>

1858
01:08:32.841 --> 01:08:33.081
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1859
01:08:33.081 --> 01:08:34.010
<v Speaker 2>bring it on.</v>

1860
01:08:34.190 --> 01:08:35.180
<v Speaker 2>Like I can handle it.</v>

1861
01:08:35.181 --> 01:08:36.920
<v Speaker 2>Keep it except for one that voluntarily.</v>

1862
01:08:37.190 --> 01:08:38.680
<v Speaker 2>That's rule one quite the way.</v>

1863
01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:41.330
<v Speaker 2>Stand up straight with your shoulders back.</v>

1864
01:08:41.390 --> 01:08:42.890
<v Speaker 2>That's the injunction.</v>

1865
01:08:43.300 --> 01:08:44.210
<v Speaker 2>It's like you can,</v>

1866
01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:48.360
<v Speaker 2>you can stand down and expose yourself to the catastrophe.</v>

1867
01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:48.921
<v Speaker 2>That's the world.</v>

1868
01:08:48.921 --> 01:08:53.921
<v Speaker 2>You could take that arm volunteerer as if there isn't,</v>

1869
01:08:53.931 --> 01:08:56.570
<v Speaker 2>if there's enough of you to manage it.</v>

1870
01:08:56.870 --> 01:08:57.980
<v Speaker 2>And the funny thing is,</v>

1871
01:08:57.981 --> 01:08:59.230
<v Speaker 2>the strange thing is,</v>

1872
01:08:59.231 --> 01:09:00.010
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>

1873
01:09:00.010 --> 01:09:01.420
<v Speaker 2>and you know this already,</v>

1874
01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:02.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1875
01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:04.880
<v Speaker 2>and if you're careful with yourself,</v>

1876
01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:08.300
<v Speaker 2>every time you take on additional responsibility,</v>

1877
01:09:08.510 --> 01:09:10.040
<v Speaker 2>you grow more terror,</v>

1878
01:09:10.410 --> 01:09:10.940
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1879
01:09:10.940 --> 01:09:12.380
<v Speaker 2>That's how life works.</v>

1880
01:09:12.850 --> 01:09:16.280
<v Speaker 2>You don't get to grow more character and strength without taking on the load.</v>

1881
01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:17.031
<v Speaker 2>You don't do that.</v>

1882
01:09:17.031 --> 01:09:20.240
<v Speaker 2>And then Jim Wright develop your musculature.</v>

1883
01:09:20.241 --> 01:09:23.030
<v Speaker 2>We felt pushing the amount of weight that you're lifting.</v>

1884
01:09:23.090 --> 01:09:25.760
<v Speaker 2>You can't just wish your apostles into growth.</v>

1885
01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:29.300
<v Speaker 2>They have to demand that they make themselves better.</v>

1886
01:09:29.310 --> 01:09:30.140
<v Speaker 2>Says,</v>

1887
01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:30.270
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1888
01:09:30.270 --> 01:09:32.590
<v Speaker 2>your life is like that.</v>

1889
01:09:32.620 --> 01:09:33.190
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1890
01:09:33.190 --> 01:09:33.350
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1891
01:09:33.350 --> 01:09:37.060
<v Speaker 2>you have received calculable potential that people are always calling you on.</v>

1892
01:09:37.070 --> 01:09:38.770
<v Speaker 2>You're not living up to your protection.</v>

1893
01:09:39.010 --> 01:09:40.610
<v Speaker 2>You don't moving up to your potential.</v>

1894
01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:44.480
<v Speaker 2>You say that to yourself and other people say it too as well because they know</v>

1895
01:09:44.481 --> 01:09:48.650
<v Speaker 2>that he would hit you in some sense is the ability to take the entire</v>

1896
01:09:48.651 --> 01:09:52.280
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe of the world on your shoulders have to do everything you possibly</v>

1897
01:09:52.281 --> 01:09:53.540
<v Speaker 2>can to make it better.</v>

1898
01:09:53.810 --> 01:09:55.700
<v Speaker 2>And in that you find the meaning in life.</v>

1899
01:09:55.701 --> 01:10:00.060
<v Speaker 2>It makes all that to justify some of that tragedy that maybe what you making,</v>

1900
01:10:00.310 --> 01:10:02.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it would make it desirable,</v>

1901
01:10:02.001 --> 01:10:04.510
<v Speaker 2>but it certainly makes it acceptable as a church,</v>

1902
01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:08.040
<v Speaker 2>you need the challenge and I think that the,</v>

1903
01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:12.500
<v Speaker 2>the possibilities that lay it open to us perhaps more now than at any point you</v>

1904
01:10:12.510 --> 01:10:14.810
<v Speaker 2>can pastor virtually without limit.</v>

1905
01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:15.801
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1906
01:10:15.801 --> 01:10:19.610
<v Speaker 2>I would say that we're recruiting things quite rapidly despite the fact that</v>

1907
01:10:19.611 --> 01:10:22.460
<v Speaker 2>we're actually stumbling forth for quite blindly.</v>

1908
01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:23.031
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1909
01:10:23.031 --> 01:10:24.260
<v Speaker 2>we can be more alert,</v>

1910
01:10:24.290 --> 01:10:26.250
<v Speaker 2>more awake and more committed to the good.</v>

1911
01:10:26.330 --> 01:10:28.520
<v Speaker 2>We are substantially a garland.</v>

1912
01:10:28.670 --> 01:10:32.630
<v Speaker 2>He knows how much we did accelerate what we're doing and how good we can make</v>

1913
01:10:32.631 --> 01:10:33.430
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1914
01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:33.841
<v Speaker 2>And if you,</v>

1915
01:10:33.841 --> 01:10:34.671
<v Speaker 2>and if you're careful,</v>

1916
01:10:34.671 --> 01:10:37.760
<v Speaker 2>you could start that locally so you don't cause too much trouble,</v>

1917
01:10:37.761 --> 01:10:39.860
<v Speaker 2>you can just figure out what's wrong with you.</v>

1918
01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:41.030
<v Speaker 2>It just ask yourself,</v>

1919
01:10:41.031 --> 01:10:46.031
<v Speaker 2>you get a big list and then you can start working on it point by point by bit.</v>

1920
01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:46.671
<v Speaker 2>Say,</v>

1921
01:10:46.671 --> 01:10:47.280
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1922
01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:49.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make tomorrow a little bit better than yesterday.</v>

1923
01:10:49.850 --> 01:10:51.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do that iteratively get,</v>

1924
01:10:51.291 --> 01:10:54.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do that every day and I'm going to see what happens if I use</v>

1925
01:10:54.801 --> 01:10:58.700
<v Speaker 2>everything at my disposal to push back against the catastrophe of the world.</v>

1926
01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:00.680
<v Speaker 2>Because maybe that would set things right.</v>

1927
01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:02.780
<v Speaker 2>And that's rule number six,</v>

1928
01:11:02.781 --> 01:11:03.980
<v Speaker 2>which is the one I'll close with.</v>

1929
01:11:03.981 --> 01:11:08.000
<v Speaker 2>Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world.</v>

1930
01:11:08.270 --> 01:11:09.103
<v Speaker 2>And so</v>

1931
01:11:12.230 --> 01:11:14.520
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible]</v>

1932
01:11:16.510 --> 01:11:17.590
<v Speaker 2>what there is to,</v>

1933
01:11:17.591 --> 01:11:18.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1934
01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:21.700
<v Speaker 2>and if you take on the responsibility,</v>

1935
01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:25.720
<v Speaker 2>if you take on responsibility for the fact that things aren't exactly how you</v>

1936
01:11:25.721 --> 01:11:28.780
<v Speaker 2>would want them to be and you've decided to important to begin to set them</v>

1937
01:11:28.781 --> 01:11:29.290
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1938
01:11:29.290 --> 01:11:33.370
<v Speaker 2>it's possible that you mold yourself across time into precisely the person who's</v>

1939
01:11:33.371 --> 01:11:34.690
<v Speaker 2>capable of doing that.</v>

1940
01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:35.920
<v Speaker 2>And why wouldn't you?</v>

1941
01:11:35.970 --> 01:11:37.420
<v Speaker 2>That that's how it works.</v>

1942
01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:41.170
<v Speaker 2>And so it seems perfectly reasonable that each of us could do that and god only</v>

1943
01:11:41.171 --> 01:11:43.050
<v Speaker 2>knows what would happen if we all did.</v>

1944
01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:46.870
<v Speaker 2>So it seems to me that it would be a lovely thing for all of us to try and it's</v>

1945
01:11:46.871 --> 01:11:48.760
<v Speaker 2>a good time in the history of,</v>

1946
01:11:48.970 --> 01:11:49.803
<v Speaker 2>of our,</v>

1947
01:11:49.810 --> 01:11:50.780
<v Speaker 2>of our species,</v>

1948
01:11:50.790 --> 01:11:53.800
<v Speaker 2>let's say for us to wake up and do precisely that.</v>

1949
01:11:53.980 --> 01:11:55.570
<v Speaker 2>So thank you.</v>

1950
01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:11.030
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

1951
01:12:40.220 --> 01:12:41.053
<v Speaker 4>standing</v>

1952
01:12:42.940 --> 01:12:46.050
<v Speaker 4>up straight with your shoulders back.</v>

1953
01:12:46.051 --> 01:12:46.884
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

1954
01:12:49.140 --> 01:12:49.973
<v Speaker 4>Perfect.</v>

1955
01:12:50.380 --> 01:12:52.650

1986
01:13:50.910 --> 01:13:55.910

1987
01:14:04.590 --> 01:14:05.423
<v Speaker 4>great job.</v>

1988
01:14:15.990 --> 01:14:16.360
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1989
01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:17.410
<v Speaker 1>so here's a question.</v>

1990
01:14:17.411 --> 01:14:18.460
<v Speaker 1>We'll start with this one.</v>

1991
01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:21.820
<v Speaker 1>Are you aware that today,</v>

1992
01:14:22.330 --> 01:14:23.350
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

1993
01:14:23.410 --> 01:14:28.410
<v Speaker 1>today is national law or day [inaudible] no.</v>

1994
01:14:40.470 --> 01:14:40.721
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1995
01:14:40.721 --> 01:14:43.670
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't aware of [inaudible].</v>

1996
01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:44.081
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1997
01:14:44.081 --> 01:14:45.700
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty damn funny.</v>

1998
01:14:46.750 --> 01:14:47.100
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1999
01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:48.280
<v Speaker 1>So here's another thing.</v>

2000
01:14:48.890 --> 01:14:49.990
<v Speaker 1>Get this at all.</v>

2001
01:14:49.991 --> 01:14:51.340
<v Speaker 1>This is quite the street.</v>

2002
01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:56.520
<v Speaker 1>So are we trying to group how to tie a Windsor Knot in my tie?</v>

2003
01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:02.020
<v Speaker 1>And so I just started that like two days ago because I have this pit and tie</v>

2004
01:15:02.021 --> 01:15:03.190
<v Speaker 1>that does look quite pregnant,</v>

2005
01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:04.180
<v Speaker 1>total wins or not.</v>

2006
01:15:04.181 --> 01:15:07.000
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a question here that's,</v>

2007
01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:10.040
<v Speaker 1>that'd be just trying to understand why the world was,</v>

2008
01:15:10.150 --> 01:15:13.090
<v Speaker 1>have you thought about switching to the full Windsor?</v>

2009
01:15:16.290 --> 01:15:17.123
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2010
01:15:17.210 --> 01:15:22.210
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] I don't know what in the world to,</v>

2011
01:15:24.210 --> 01:15:25.043
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

2012
01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:27.730
<v Speaker 1>she knows what to do about that,</v>

2013
01:15:27.790 --> 01:15:28.623
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

2014
01:15:29.350 --> 01:15:30.183
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2015
01:15:30.190 --> 01:15:30.820
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2016
01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:35.060
<v Speaker 1>you've accumulated fade so quickly over the last few years.</v>

2017
01:15:35.330 --> 01:15:38.140
<v Speaker 1>You keep yourself humble.</v>

2018
01:15:38.260 --> 01:15:39.700
<v Speaker 1>And then there's some other questions like,</v>

2019
01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:41.890
<v Speaker 1>which is quite similar,</v>

2020
01:15:41.891 --> 01:15:42.531
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

2021
01:15:42.531 --> 01:15:43.364
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2022
01:15:44.230 --> 01:15:47.500
<v Speaker 1>where do you do to protect yourself from corruption since being put on a</v>

2023
01:15:47.501 --> 01:15:48.161
<v Speaker 1>pedestal?</v>

2024
01:15:48.161 --> 01:15:51.760
<v Speaker 1>What can do in the same situation?</v>

2025
01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:52.421
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2026
01:15:52.421 --> 01:15:52.751
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2027
01:15:52.751 --> 01:15:53.584
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>

2028
01:15:53.590 --> 01:15:54.850
<v Speaker 1>let's answer those.</v>

2029
01:15:55.210 --> 01:15:56.043
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2030
01:15:57.100 --> 01:15:57.970
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2031
01:15:58.390 --> 01:16:02.620
<v Speaker 1>I do these sorts of things that I was talking about to you today.</v>

2032
01:16:02.650 --> 01:16:02.921
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2033
01:16:02.921 --> 01:16:04.800
<v Speaker 1>I have an eight,</v>

2034
01:16:05.410 --> 01:16:08.890
<v Speaker 1>let's say that I've thought through very deeply,</v>

2035
01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:09.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2036
01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:11.320
<v Speaker 1>when I wrote my first book,</v>

2037
01:16:11.321 --> 01:16:12.370
<v Speaker 1>which I told you about,</v>

2038
01:16:12.430 --> 01:16:14.730
<v Speaker 1>and I hope you have version maps,</v>

2039
01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:15.573
<v Speaker 1>VT,</v>

2040
01:16:15.990 --> 01:16:16.823
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2041
01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:21.100
<v Speaker 1>I thought about what happened in Auschwitz.</v>

2042
01:16:22.690 --> 01:16:25.900
<v Speaker 1>I thought about it from the perspective of a perpetrator,</v>

2043
01:16:26.290 --> 01:16:30.190
<v Speaker 1>not from the perspective of a bystander or a victim.</v>

2044
01:16:30.430 --> 01:16:31.263
<v Speaker 1>Let's say.</v>

2045
01:16:31.810 --> 01:16:32.680
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

2046
01:16:33.070 --> 01:16:37.900
<v Speaker 1>how is it that people could do what was done in Auschwitz by the guards?</v>

2047
01:16:38.230 --> 01:16:41.170
<v Speaker 1>But I thought hope that more specifically I thought,</v>

2048
01:16:41.230 --> 01:16:45.610
<v Speaker 1>how is it that that person who is human could do that given that I'm also human</v>

2049
01:16:45.611 --> 01:16:47.230
<v Speaker 1>and I can't see how I could do that.</v>

2050
01:16:48.310 --> 01:16:51.490
<v Speaker 1>And then I thought about until I could figure out how we could do it</v>

2051
01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:54.580
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

2052
01:16:54.970 --> 01:16:56.760
<v Speaker 1>and then I figured out that I could do,</v>

2053
01:16:58.020 --> 01:17:00.310
<v Speaker 1>then I figured out that I could probably enjoy it.</v>

2054
01:17:02.830 --> 01:17:06.490
<v Speaker 1>And so that scared me enough so that I figured out that I tried to see what the</v>

2055
01:17:06.491 --> 01:17:07.540
<v Speaker 1>answer to that one,</v>

2056
01:17:08.570 --> 01:17:09.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2057
01:17:09.260 --> 01:17:10.950
<v Speaker 1>up as far away as possible.</v>

2058
01:17:12.420 --> 01:17:15.950
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say that part of what I do to keep my feet on the ground,</v>

2059
01:17:15.951 --> 01:17:17.330
<v Speaker 1>which I written for the offense,</v>

2060
01:17:17.331 --> 01:17:18.440
<v Speaker 1>capacity for evil,</v>

2061
01:17:18.441 --> 01:17:20.810
<v Speaker 1>that every single one of us is characterized by,</v>

2062
01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:24.020
<v Speaker 1>and I terrified enough with that,</v>

2063
01:17:24.021 --> 01:17:27.350
<v Speaker 1>that say to try to Orient Myself property in the world,</v>

2064
01:17:27.660 --> 01:17:30.450
<v Speaker 1>say that fear of God is the beginning of quiz.</v>

2065
01:17:30.650 --> 01:17:32.060
<v Speaker 1>That's a good way of thinking about,</v>

2066
01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:33.493
<v Speaker 1>you could say</v>

2067
01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:43.300
<v Speaker 1>people conceptualize let's say,</v>

2068
01:17:43.330 --> 01:17:46.780
<v Speaker 1>because if you want to keep yourself on the up and up,</v>

2069
01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:49.000
<v Speaker 1>it's one thing to be ab for heaven,</v>

2070
01:17:49.020 --> 01:17:50.970
<v Speaker 1>but it's another thing to be a big weights.</v>

2071
01:17:51.410 --> 01:17:54.140
<v Speaker 1>And I don't care how cynical you are,</v>

2072
01:17:54.190 --> 01:17:56.530
<v Speaker 1>you can be cynical enough so that you don't believe in heaven.</v>

2073
01:17:57.130 --> 01:18:00.700
<v Speaker 1>There's no way you can be cynical enough so that you don't believe in hell.</v>

2074
01:18:01.750 --> 01:18:05.140
<v Speaker 1>And so once I've established that if you have any sense of the hall,</v>

2075
01:18:05.141 --> 01:18:06.910
<v Speaker 1>then at least you could aim away from that.</v>

2076
01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:11.230
<v Speaker 1>And if that's what you're doing and you know how deep that place where he is,</v>

2077
01:18:11.470 --> 01:18:13.840
<v Speaker 1>then that can help you keep your feet on the ground.</v>

2078
01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:15.850
<v Speaker 1>That's what it looks up to me.</v>

2079
01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:17.560
<v Speaker 1>So that's one of the answers.</v>

2080
01:18:17.561 --> 01:18:20.350
<v Speaker 1>I try to eat as far away from that as possible.</v>

2081
01:18:20.730 --> 01:18:23.020
<v Speaker 1>So that's part of what I laid up tonight.</v>

2082
01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Just like what am I trying to do?</v>

2083
01:18:26.180 --> 01:18:27.013
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2084
01:18:27.430 --> 01:18:28.850
<v Speaker 1>I have my flaws and so no,</v>

2085
01:18:29.170 --> 01:18:30.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing this perfectly,</v>

2086
01:18:30.431 --> 01:18:30.971
<v Speaker 1>but I'm dancing.</v>

2087
01:18:30.971 --> 01:18:33.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to aim a week from that.</v>

2088
01:18:33.490 --> 01:18:35.160
<v Speaker 1>Tried to take care of herself,</v>

2089
01:18:35.890 --> 01:18:39.510
<v Speaker 1>trying to take care of herself in a way that is maximally beneficial to buy</v>

2090
01:18:39.511 --> 01:18:40.344
<v Speaker 1>salmon.</v>

2091
01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:44.470
<v Speaker 1>And I'm trying to do both of them was in a way that's maximally beneficial to</v>

2092
01:18:44.471 --> 01:18:45.370
<v Speaker 1>the community.</v>

2093
01:18:45.970 --> 01:18:47.140
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm trying to do with.</v>

2094
01:18:47.141 --> 01:18:51.190
<v Speaker 1>The reason I'm trying to do that is partly because that's the best way a wave</v>

2095
01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:52.260
<v Speaker 1>from hell sort of.</v>

2096
01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:53.470
<v Speaker 1>That's a pretty good start.</v>

2097
01:18:53.471 --> 01:18:58.471
<v Speaker 1>But I also feeling that because I can't think of anything better possibly to do.</v>

2098
01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:02.310
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a immense challenge to do that.</v>

2099
01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:03.640
<v Speaker 1>And you need a challenge,</v>

2100
01:19:04.030 --> 01:19:04.301
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2101
01:19:04.301 --> 01:19:06.280
<v Speaker 1>And so why not have that as a challenge?</v>

2102
01:19:07.190 --> 01:19:08.890
<v Speaker 1>And I've talked these things through.</v>

2103
01:19:08.891 --> 01:19:10.810
<v Speaker 1>They're not shallow commitments.</v>

2104
01:19:10.900 --> 01:19:14.150
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean that I'm with error right there.</v>

2105
01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:17.770
<v Speaker 1>So then the other thing that you have to do,</v>

2106
01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:19.440
<v Speaker 1>if you want to stop yourself for big,</v>

2107
01:19:19.450 --> 01:19:23.050
<v Speaker 1>corrupt it is you want to surround yourself with the right people.</v>

2108
01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:27.940
<v Speaker 1>I know rule wonders stamp at straight with your shoulders back rule to it's</v>

2109
01:19:27.941 --> 01:19:31.240
<v Speaker 1>treat yourself like you're someone you're responsible for helping.</v>

2110
01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:32.980
<v Speaker 1>And we're all three years,</v>

2111
01:19:33.010 --> 01:19:35.920
<v Speaker 1>make friends with the people who want the best for him.</v>

2112
01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:41.200
<v Speaker 1>And those aren't injunctions about how to have a happier life there.</v>

2113
01:19:41.260 --> 01:19:44.410
<v Speaker 1>Injunctions about how to act morally in the world.</v>

2114
01:19:44.470 --> 01:19:48.190
<v Speaker 1>You need to take care of yourself like you're someone who's worthwhile and you</v>

2115
01:19:48.191 --> 01:19:51.700
<v Speaker 1>need to have people around you view you in the same way.</v>

2116
01:19:51.970 --> 01:19:53.830
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean they're letting you off the hook.</v>

2117
01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:55.420
<v Speaker 1>Quite the contrary.</v>

2118
01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:56.980
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm fortunate,</v>

2119
01:19:57.670 --> 01:19:59.740
<v Speaker 1>I have two kids,</v>

2120
01:20:00.010 --> 01:20:03.220
<v Speaker 1>they're both very sensible and their eyes are open and they're watching what I'm</v>

2121
01:20:03.221 --> 01:20:08.221
<v Speaker 1>doing and if I make a mistake or they don't make a mistake or not be cautious</v>

2122
01:20:08.461 --> 01:20:08.730
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>

2123
01:20:08.730 --> 01:20:12.950
<v Speaker 1>they telling me why something takes away my Twitter password all the time.</v>

2124
01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:17.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2125
01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:18.290
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2126
01:20:18.290 --> 01:20:18.640
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2127
01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:19.041
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2128
01:20:19.041 --> 01:20:20.080
<v Speaker 1>I can get it back,</v>

2129
01:20:20.930 --> 01:20:21.880
<v Speaker 1>reset the password,</v>

2130
01:20:21.910 --> 01:20:23.320
<v Speaker 1>but it's how you relate to him too.</v>

2131
01:20:23.380 --> 01:20:24.020
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

2132
01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:28.210
<v Speaker 1>So I don't like traveling with my wife and she keeps an eye on me.</v>

2133
01:20:28.220 --> 01:20:28.790
<v Speaker 1>She's,</v>

2134
01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:31.420
<v Speaker 1>she's always in the crowd and she sees what's happening.</v>

2135
01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:35.520
<v Speaker 1>She's a sensible person that she's picked tempered in your own inner fire.</v>

2136
01:20:35.810 --> 01:20:39.590
<v Speaker 1>So she watches and then I have friends around me and an extended family and</v>

2137
01:20:39.591 --> 01:20:42.080
<v Speaker 1>they're all watching and they are not hesitate.</v>

2138
01:20:42.110 --> 01:20:44.090
<v Speaker 1>They don't hesitate at all to do,</v>

2139
01:20:44.140 --> 01:20:46.400
<v Speaker 1>let me know if they think that what I'm doing is working.</v>

2140
01:20:46.401 --> 01:20:48.830
<v Speaker 1>But if it's not working and they take our greatest mistake,</v>

2141
01:20:48.831 --> 01:20:51.950
<v Speaker 1>it's like we have a phone call and they told me exactly what they think I did</v>

2142
01:20:51.951 --> 01:20:53.900
<v Speaker 1>wrong and how are we going to fix it and how you listen.</v>

2143
01:20:54.380 --> 01:20:58.400
<v Speaker 1>Because I don't want to do any more things wrong than absolutely necessary.</v>

2144
01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:02.780
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say part of the reasons that I keep my feet on the ground,</v>

2145
01:21:03.250 --> 01:21:06.530
<v Speaker 1>cause I hate to say I keep myself humble because I don't want to claim that,</v>

2146
01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:08.530
<v Speaker 1>but I'm trying to keep my feet on the ground.</v>

2147
01:21:08.531 --> 01:21:12.440
<v Speaker 1>Is because I'm properly terrified of doing things wrong.</v>

2148
01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:16.430
<v Speaker 1>And so I'd do my best to be very careful about what I say,</v>

2149
01:21:16.490 --> 01:21:17.051
<v Speaker 1>what I do,</v>

2150
01:21:17.051 --> 01:21:21.800
<v Speaker 1>and so far that has produced any catastrophic consequences.</v>

2151
01:21:21.801 --> 01:21:23.300
<v Speaker 1>So parades of that.</v>

2152
01:21:23.590 --> 01:21:24.423
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2153
01:21:31.580 --> 01:21:32.060
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2154
01:21:32.060 --> 01:21:32.893
<v Speaker 1>well</v>

2155
01:21:34.220 --> 01:21:35.720
<v Speaker 1>this is very serious.</v>

2156
01:21:35.810 --> 01:21:38.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I should address it because I was somewhat tired,</v>

2157
01:21:39.050 --> 01:21:43.630
<v Speaker 1>but I'll give it a shot because it's important how it's very serious troubles.</v>

2158
01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:46.960
<v Speaker 1>I plan on taking my own lights very soon.</v>

2159
01:21:48.380 --> 01:21:49.213
<v Speaker 1>Why it should?</v>

2160
01:21:51.660 --> 01:21:52.493
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2161
01:21:54.770 --> 01:21:55.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to sit.</v>

2162
01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:57.010
<v Speaker 1>This is a casual request,</v>

2163
01:21:57.250 --> 01:21:57.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2164
01:21:57.740 --> 01:22:00.950
<v Speaker 1>let's be put out for the purposes of display.</v>

2165
01:22:01.820 --> 01:22:01.941
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2166
01:22:01.941 --> 01:22:06.941
<v Speaker 1>the first thing I would say is you have to think very carefully through the</v>

2167
01:22:07.341 --> 01:22:09.440
<v Speaker 1>consequences of that for other people.</v>

2168
01:22:10.580 --> 01:22:14.510
<v Speaker 1>So I've had clients in my clinical practice with never recovered from the</v>

2169
01:22:14.511 --> 01:22:17.570
<v Speaker 1>suicide of her family member decades later.</v>

2170
01:22:17.630 --> 01:22:19.490
<v Speaker 1>They were still torturing yourself above it.</v>

2171
01:22:19.910 --> 01:22:21.420
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what you leave behind.</v>

2172
01:22:21.650 --> 01:22:22.160
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

2173
01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:23.750
<v Speaker 1>problem is you might be dreaming.</v>

2174
01:22:25.010 --> 01:22:29.060
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're feeling like this big twist is against you and that people deserve</v>

2175
01:22:29.061 --> 01:22:31.520
<v Speaker 1>to suffer for the misery that they imposed upon you.</v>

2176
01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:33.550
<v Speaker 1>That I would say think very,</v>

2177
01:22:33.551 --> 01:22:35.840
<v Speaker 1>very carefully before you pull down that route.</v>

2178
01:22:36.970 --> 01:22:41.260
<v Speaker 1>It's a terrible thing to leave people with and so part of the reason that</v>

2179
01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:46.280
<v Speaker 1>suicide has legal legally post societies is because it absolutely devastates the</v>

2180
01:22:47.210 --> 01:22:49.660
<v Speaker 1>people you leave behind and you might take what made,</v>

2181
01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:49.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2182
01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:51.040
<v Speaker 1>if you're really depressed,</v>

2183
01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:52.550
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're really depressed.</v>

2184
01:22:52.610 --> 01:22:53.630
<v Speaker 1>That's a possibility.</v>

2185
01:22:54.890 --> 01:22:57.680
<v Speaker 1>He might take all those people would be better off without me.</v>

2186
01:22:57.800 --> 01:22:59.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like it makes you get really depressed,</v>

2187
01:22:59.571 --> 01:23:03.080
<v Speaker 1>you fatigue that way we can even get to the point where you can't think any</v>

2188
01:23:03.081 --> 01:23:08.081
<v Speaker 1>other way that and would say if you're at the point where you can't think any</v>

2189
01:23:08.711 --> 01:23:09.580
<v Speaker 1>other way than that,</v>

2190
01:23:09.581 --> 01:23:13.840
<v Speaker 1>that you should tell someone and you should go to the hospital because that can</v>

2191
01:23:13.841 --> 01:23:14.674
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

2192
01:23:14.710 --> 01:23:16.480
<v Speaker 1>It can happen if you get depressed.</v>

2193
01:23:16.660 --> 01:23:18.400
<v Speaker 1>There are treatments for depression,</v>

2194
01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:19.181
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2195
01:23:19.181 --> 01:23:21.580
<v Speaker 1>and many of them work for some people,</v>

2196
01:23:21.581 --> 01:23:22.414
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants,</v>

2197
01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:26.830
<v Speaker 1>work Matt out that don't work for everyone and not claiming that they're a</v>

2198
01:23:26.831 --> 01:23:27.664
<v Speaker 1>panacea,</v>

2199
01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:30.610
<v Speaker 1>but they certainly beat the hell out of suicide.</v>

2200
01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:31.520
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2201
01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:34.750
<v Speaker 1>Even if they have some negative side effects and sometimes they do quite</v>

2202
01:23:34.751 --> 01:23:35.830
<v Speaker 1>frequently they do.</v>

2203
01:23:36.270 --> 01:23:38.710
<v Speaker 1>The negative side effects aren't fatal.</v>

2204
01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:44.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like well are certainly there's a possibility that that that your condition</v>

2205
01:23:45.071 --> 01:23:46.150
<v Speaker 1>is physical,</v>

2206
01:23:46.180 --> 01:23:47.980
<v Speaker 1>that you're ill in some way,</v>

2207
01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:51.670
<v Speaker 1>either physically or perhaps you have a psychological problem and maybe you were</v>

2208
01:23:51.671 --> 01:23:53.230
<v Speaker 1>hurt her or,</v>

2209
01:23:53.350 --> 01:23:55.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's lots of reasons that people get depressed that are very,</v>

2210
01:23:55.811 --> 01:23:56.591
<v Speaker 1>very complex.</v>

2211
01:23:56.591 --> 01:23:58.420
<v Speaker 1>I would say don't give up hope without,</v>

2212
01:23:58.610 --> 01:24:03.060
<v Speaker 1>don't give up hope and do something fine up before you've explored all possible</v>

2213
01:24:03.061 --> 01:24:06.070
<v Speaker 1>the auctions and if you haven't talked to a psychologist,</v>

2214
01:24:06.071 --> 01:24:07.540
<v Speaker 1>you haven't talked to a psychiatrist,</v>

2215
01:24:07.541 --> 01:24:11.110
<v Speaker 1>you have to try and antidepressants you haven't revealed to your family or</v>

2216
01:24:11.111 --> 01:24:13.330
<v Speaker 1>people that care for you that this is how you're feeling.</v>

2217
01:24:13.331 --> 01:24:18.331
<v Speaker 1>Then you owe it to yourself and them to explore every possible avenue before you</v>

2218
01:24:18.701 --> 01:24:23.701
<v Speaker 1>take such a step and then you don't want to deprive the world of who I've of</v>

2219
01:24:23.801 --> 01:24:25.840
<v Speaker 1>what you could bring to the world.</v>

2220
01:24:26.050 --> 01:24:26.890
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing.</v>

2221
01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:30.460
<v Speaker 1>You know you have intrinsic value and you can't just cash.</v>

2222
01:24:30.461 --> 01:24:31.510
<v Speaker 1>We couldn't have to an end.</v>

2223
01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:34.330
<v Speaker 1>You leave a hole in the fabric of be itself.</v>

2224
01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:35.860
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

2225
01:24:35.910 --> 01:24:38.470
<v Speaker 1>and why is that that I once worked with Sam,</v>

2226
01:24:38.530 --> 01:24:39.790
<v Speaker 1>he was a very strange person.</v>

2227
01:24:39.791 --> 01:24:40.870
<v Speaker 1>He was a psychologist,</v>

2228
01:24:40.871 --> 01:24:44.010
<v Speaker 1>have to admit maximum security prison and Edmonton.</v>

2229
01:24:44.011 --> 01:24:45.670
<v Speaker 1>And I worked with him for a while,</v>

2230
01:24:45.730 --> 01:24:46.270
<v Speaker 1>briefly,</v>

2231
01:24:46.270 --> 01:24:48.130
<v Speaker 1>very briefly up the prison itself.</v>

2232
01:24:48.131 --> 01:24:48.970
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

2233
01:24:49.300 --> 01:24:51.550
<v Speaker 1>you can always commit suicide tomorrow.</v>

2234
01:24:52.710 --> 01:24:54.550
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very,</v>

2235
01:24:54.580 --> 01:24:54.761
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2236
01:24:54.761 --> 01:24:56.680
<v Speaker 1>it's a flippant statement in some sense,</v>

2237
01:24:56.681 --> 01:24:58.500
<v Speaker 1>but he meant it in a very serious way.</v>

2238
01:24:58.501 --> 01:25:03.501
<v Speaker 1>It's like you only get to decide that once and you can put it off.</v>

2239
01:25:04.630 --> 01:25:08.950
<v Speaker 1>So I would say just put it off and then put it off score and then put it off</v>

2240
01:25:08.951 --> 01:25:12.820
<v Speaker 1>some more and see what you can do to put yourself together.</v>

2241
01:25:13.270 --> 01:25:16.240
<v Speaker 1>You don't explore every possible option.</v>

2242
01:25:16.870 --> 01:25:17.441
<v Speaker 1>And if,</v>

2243
01:25:17.441 --> 01:25:17.891
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

2244
01:25:17.891 --> 01:25:21.400
<v Speaker 1>if you're so hopeless that you have a suicidal plan,</v>

2245
01:25:21.610 --> 01:25:23.050
<v Speaker 1>which is a real sign of danger.</v>

2246
01:25:23.051 --> 01:25:24.480
<v Speaker 1>If you really know how you do it,</v>

2247
01:25:24.490 --> 01:25:25.840
<v Speaker 1>you've thought about denim and say,</v>

2248
01:25:26.140 --> 01:25:27.760
<v Speaker 1>tell someone for God's sake,</v>

2249
01:25:27.761 --> 01:25:30.940
<v Speaker 1>tell them at or goil hospital and tell them.</v>

2250
01:25:31.420 --> 01:25:33.250
<v Speaker 1>And for sure trying to depress.</v>

2251
01:25:33.251 --> 01:25:33.730
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2252
01:25:33.730 --> 01:25:35.290
<v Speaker 1>what the hell do you have to lose?</v>

2253
01:25:36.010 --> 01:25:41.010
<v Speaker 1>So do everything you possibly can to address the issue before you do something</v>

2254
01:25:42.491 --> 01:25:43.270
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

2255
01:25:43.270 --> 01:25:45.940
<v Speaker 1>Do give some thought to the people that you're going to leave behind.</v>

2256
01:25:45.941 --> 01:25:46.771
<v Speaker 1>Because believe me,</v>

2257
01:25:46.771 --> 01:25:48.730
<v Speaker 1>you may just absolutely wait for the moment,</v>

2258
01:25:48.731 --> 01:25:50.490
<v Speaker 1>the way that they will never recover from it.</v>

2259
01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:53.940
<v Speaker 1>You cannot fix someone's suicide.</v>

2260
01:25:54.310 --> 01:25:58.150
<v Speaker 1>You're stuck with it and you think you torture yourself from the rest of your</v>

2261
01:25:58.151 --> 01:25:58.660
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

2262
01:25:58.660 --> 01:26:02.110
<v Speaker 1>If I would have only known if I would have only said something different,</v>

2263
01:26:02.140 --> 01:26:04.310
<v Speaker 1>this particular talked to her,</v>

2264
01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:05.173
<v Speaker 1>her relative,</v>

2265
01:26:05.410 --> 01:26:09.410
<v Speaker 1>a sibling who committed suicide like 20 minutes before he committed suicide</v>

2266
01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:13.640
<v Speaker 1>probably after he took the pills and she was kind of preoccupied because he</v>

2267
01:26:13.641 --> 01:26:15.380
<v Speaker 1>don't know that the person at the other end,</v>

2268
01:26:15.381 --> 01:26:18.620
<v Speaker 1>because at the end of their Kevin and she never forgave yourself from how it</v>

2269
01:26:18.621 --> 01:26:19.090
<v Speaker 1>respond.</v>

2270
01:26:19.090 --> 01:26:21.170
<v Speaker 1>Big Property in that last phone call,</v>

2271
01:26:21.410 --> 01:26:22.410
<v Speaker 1>that's a hell of a thing.</v>

2272
01:26:22.411 --> 01:26:23.450
<v Speaker 1>Delete someone with,</v>

2273
01:26:24.590 --> 01:26:29.590
<v Speaker 1>so I would say of the final thing I would say is don't be so sure that your life</v>

2274
01:26:29.841 --> 01:26:30.980
<v Speaker 1>is yours to take.</v>

2275
01:26:32.150 --> 01:26:32.421
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2276
01:26:32.421 --> 01:26:35.180
<v Speaker 1>you don't own yourself the way that you own an object,</v>

2277
01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:37.790
<v Speaker 1>you have a moral obligation to yourself as a,</v>

2278
01:26:37.850 --> 01:26:39.830
<v Speaker 1>as a locus of divine value.</v>

2279
01:26:39.860 --> 01:26:40.693
<v Speaker 1>Let's say.</v>

2280
01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:42.220
<v Speaker 1>You can treat that counseling,</v>

2281
01:26:42.820 --> 01:26:43.370
<v Speaker 1>that's theirs,</v>

2282
01:26:43.370 --> 01:26:44.330
<v Speaker 1>it's wrong.</v>

2283
01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:45.950
<v Speaker 1>So those are the reasons.</v>

2284
01:26:47.090 --> 01:26:50.270
<v Speaker 1>Exploring everything you can explore to put yourself back on your feet,</v>

2285
01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:51.471
<v Speaker 1>all the things.</v>

2286
01:26:51.471 --> 01:26:53.290
<v Speaker 1>There's all sorts of treatments for depression.</v>

2287
01:26:54.290 --> 01:26:58.700
<v Speaker 1>Don't leave the people around you with that to suffer for the rest of the Lux.</v>

2288
01:26:59.090 --> 01:27:03.920
<v Speaker 1>Don't underestimate your value in the world at don't underestimate the fact that</v>

2289
01:27:03.921 --> 01:27:05.300
<v Speaker 1>suicide is broad.</v>

2290
01:27:05.870 --> 01:27:10.430
<v Speaker 1>And so those are four reasons why you should end your life soon or at all for</v>

2291
01:27:10.431 --> 01:27:11.264
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2292
01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:13.490
<v Speaker 1>So good luck.</v>

2293
01:27:13.910 --> 01:27:18.910
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible]</v>

2294
01:27:25.580 --> 01:27:28.460
<v Speaker 1>I am the harvest at Herron art school.</v>

2295
01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:33.050
<v Speaker 1>What's your advice for young artists trying to shatter the conventions of</v>

2296
01:27:33.051 --> 01:27:34.430
<v Speaker 1>political correctness?</v>

2297
01:27:35.310 --> 01:27:35.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2298
01:27:35.670 --> 01:27:38.630
<v Speaker 1>the first one that we probably get the hell out of art school</v>

2299
01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:43.640
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] that's actually fairly</v>

2300
01:27:48.300 --> 01:27:53.300
<v Speaker 1>fairly straight forward if you want to shatter the conventions of political</v>

2301
01:27:54.601 --> 01:27:55.171
<v Speaker 1>correctness,</v>

2302
01:27:55.171 --> 01:27:55.740
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

2303
01:27:55.740 --> 01:28:00.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't take any field has been warped or thoroughly that fine art.</v>

2304
01:28:00.070 --> 01:28:01.830
<v Speaker 1>Quite quite political correctness,</v>

2305
01:28:01.831 --> 01:28:02.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2306
01:28:02.430 --> 01:28:02.671
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

2307
01:28:02.671 --> 01:28:06.160
<v Speaker 1>and that's really saying something because plenty of fields if the lenti work,</v>

2308
01:28:06.410 --> 01:28:08.010
<v Speaker 1>but I would say your best,</v>

2309
01:28:08.310 --> 01:28:09.970
<v Speaker 1>your best bet is two fold.</v>

2310
01:28:09.980 --> 01:28:13.050
<v Speaker 1>One is learn how to manage your career in effective business,</v>

2311
01:28:13.051 --> 01:28:13.884
<v Speaker 1>like manner,</v>

2312
01:28:14.130 --> 01:28:17.400
<v Speaker 1>make yourself come through in terms of putting yourself together economically.</v>

2313
01:28:17.790 --> 01:28:19.800
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're going to be really,</v>

2314
01:28:19.830 --> 01:28:20.550
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

2315
01:28:20.550 --> 01:28:21.510
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

2316
01:28:21.690 --> 01:28:22.530
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

2317
01:28:22.980 --> 01:28:26.580
<v Speaker 1>really hard to monetize statistic production.</v>

2318
01:28:27.090 --> 01:28:29.520
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're going to support yourself being an artist,</v>

2319
01:28:29.521 --> 01:28:31.290
<v Speaker 1>you better be a sharp is this person.</v>

2320
01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:35.100
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing that irritates political correct people more than that in that</v>

2321
01:28:35.101 --> 01:28:35.850
<v Speaker 1>development.</v>

2322
01:28:35.850 --> 01:28:37.440
<v Speaker 1>So you could start by that.</v>

2323
01:28:37.441 --> 01:28:41.160
<v Speaker 1>It's like develop yourself into a cabinet negotiator and see if you could figure</v>

2324
01:28:41.161 --> 01:28:43.530
<v Speaker 1>out how you could actually have a career as an artist.</v>

2325
01:28:43.770 --> 01:28:44.940
<v Speaker 1>I would say to begin with,</v>

2326
01:28:44.941 --> 01:28:48.300
<v Speaker 1>what you're probably going to have to do is have an actual job and do your art</v>

2327
01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:49.380
<v Speaker 1>art time because,</v>

2328
01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:54.680
<v Speaker 1>and let us your fed globally tell it to that even that it probably won't work.</v>

2329
01:28:55.020 --> 01:28:59.820
<v Speaker 1>So you could even have the jaw and then you could work really hard on your art.</v>

2330
01:28:59.821 --> 01:29:02.250
<v Speaker 1>And with any luck over the period of about a decade,</v>

2331
01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:03.730
<v Speaker 1>you can build connection that works.</v>

2332
01:29:03.731 --> 01:29:07.440
<v Speaker 1>If you could learn how the gallery system works and you could be influential</v>

2333
01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:08.940
<v Speaker 1>people and you can sell your art,</v>

2334
01:29:09.010 --> 01:29:11.010
<v Speaker 1>maybe you could start to figure out how to make a living.</v>

2335
01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:12.331
<v Speaker 1>You got to figure it out.</v>

2336
01:29:12.331 --> 01:29:16.520
<v Speaker 1>It's going to take like 25 30% of your client at an absence and then you might</v>

2337
01:29:16.521 --> 01:29:19.710
<v Speaker 1>totally agreed with that and that'll irritate the hell out with your politically</v>

2338
01:29:19.711 --> 01:29:20.700
<v Speaker 1>correct Coles.</v>

2339
01:29:20.910 --> 01:29:25.440
<v Speaker 1>So because they'll say you sold out and people who say that those are,</v>

2340
01:29:25.450 --> 01:29:28.440
<v Speaker 1>we never have the opportunity to sell out,</v>

2341
01:29:38.550 --> 01:29:42.960
<v Speaker 1>justify that absolute moral respectability.</v>

2342
01:29:43.010 --> 01:29:44.430
<v Speaker 1>So it's an appalling gate.</v>

2343
01:29:44.610 --> 01:29:49.610
<v Speaker 1>The other thing you can do is study great artists throughout history and then</v>

2344
01:29:50.041 --> 01:29:54.120
<v Speaker 1>hone your craft because there's this idea of it's sort of a postmodern idea</v>

2345
01:29:54.121 --> 01:29:54.600
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2346
01:29:54.600 --> 01:29:54.841
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2347
01:29:54.841 --> 01:29:56.490
<v Speaker 1>it's all freedom of expression.</v>

2348
01:29:56.491 --> 01:29:57.840
<v Speaker 1>You don't need any skill.</v>

2349
01:29:57.900 --> 01:29:59.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's,</v>

2350
01:30:00.450 --> 01:30:01.283
<v Speaker 1>that's not,</v>

2351
01:30:01.490 --> 01:30:02.610
<v Speaker 1>that's not wrong.</v>

2352
01:30:02.611 --> 01:30:05.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like anti true.</v>

2353
01:30:07.750 --> 01:30:08.940
<v Speaker 1>It's not just an error.</v>

2354
01:30:08.990 --> 01:30:09.331
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2355
01:30:09.331 --> 01:30:13.870
<v Speaker 1>you know what the truth is it then you figure out the exact opposite of that and</v>

2356
01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:16.350
<v Speaker 1>put that forward as a proposition.</v>

2357
01:30:16.351 --> 01:30:18.540
<v Speaker 1>It's like develop your skill,</v>

2358
01:30:18.570 --> 01:30:19.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2359
01:30:19.190 --> 01:30:24.190
<v Speaker 1>they're the pain to draw the scope to things and graphics person.</v>

2360
01:30:26.130 --> 01:30:29.280
<v Speaker 1>All these things develop your skill and then,</v>

2361
01:30:29.370 --> 01:30:30.870
<v Speaker 1>and your discipline as well.</v>

2362
01:30:30.871 --> 01:30:34.320
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe you'll be able to transcend that discipline with the skill and</v>

2363
01:30:34.321 --> 01:30:35.910
<v Speaker 1>produce something truly original.</v>

2364
01:30:36.330 --> 01:30:38.610
<v Speaker 1>But you could make yourself,</v>

2365
01:30:38.670 --> 01:30:42.240
<v Speaker 1>you could master the techniques of the great artists of the past and you know,</v>

2366
01:30:42.241 --> 01:30:42.630
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2367
01:30:42.630 --> 01:30:43.710
<v Speaker 1>the trending types to say,</v>

2368
01:30:43.711 --> 01:30:44.840
<v Speaker 1>well that's all past set.</v>

2369
01:30:44.841 --> 01:30:45.241
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2370
01:30:45.241 --> 01:30:48.660
<v Speaker 1>it's not nearly as passe as their demo opinions are going to be 10 years from</v>

2371
01:30:48.661 --> 01:30:49.494
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

2372
01:30:49.550 --> 01:30:50.383
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2373
01:30:56.850 --> 01:30:57.210
<v Speaker 4>Started</v>

2374
01:30:57.210 --> 01:30:58.150
<v Speaker 1>an interesting guy.</v>

2375
01:30:58.151 --> 01:30:59.740
<v Speaker 1>You can find him on Youtube.</v>

2376
01:30:59.741 --> 01:31:02.920
<v Speaker 1>His name is Jonathan powershell and he's,</v>

2377
01:31:02.950 --> 01:31:03.520
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

2378
01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:06.810
<v Speaker 1>he was in an art school like you at a place called [inaudible],</v>

2379
01:31:06.850 --> 01:31:09.370
<v Speaker 1>which is like mind boggling late politically correct.</v>

2380
01:31:09.820 --> 01:31:13.390
<v Speaker 1>He was actually a pretty good postmodernist score.</v>

2381
01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:13.880
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

2382
01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:14.713
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2383
01:31:14.740 --> 01:31:18.340
<v Speaker 1>And he got completely tired of the political correctness that characterize the</v>

2384
01:31:18.341 --> 01:31:23.320
<v Speaker 1>art schools and he became a medieval carver of orthodox icons.</v>

2385
01:31:23.380 --> 01:31:24.300
<v Speaker 1>That was his,</v>

2386
01:31:24.420 --> 01:31:26.410
<v Speaker 1>his reaction against the,</v>

2387
01:31:26.750 --> 01:31:27.630
<v Speaker 1>you know the training,</v>

2388
01:31:27.631 --> 01:31:32.410
<v Speaker 1>political politically correct orthodox and he makes absolutely beautiful pieces.</v>

2389
01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:33.700
<v Speaker 1>They're worth taking a look at,</v>

2390
01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:38.060
<v Speaker 1>so that was Jonathan how now when he's making youtube videos about syphilis,</v>

2391
01:31:38.260 --> 01:31:39.430
<v Speaker 1>Christian art that are really,</v>

2392
01:31:39.431 --> 01:31:40.510
<v Speaker 1>really quite good.</v>

2393
01:31:40.660 --> 01:31:42.580
<v Speaker 1>He's actually making a living doing that way too.</v>

2394
01:31:42.730 --> 01:31:43.880
<v Speaker 1>That's so funny.</v>

2395
01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:44.993
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2396
01:31:45.450 --> 01:31:47.570
<v Speaker 1>imagine how are we there yet?</v>

2397
01:31:47.630 --> 01:31:49.820
<v Speaker 1>Was is that there were firsties Canadian.</v>

2398
01:31:49.821 --> 01:31:51.030
<v Speaker 1>Then second of all cigarettes,</v>

2399
01:31:51.031 --> 01:31:56.031
<v Speaker 1>if I'm liking it to get the second is that he's making a living talking about</v>

2400
01:31:56.651 --> 01:31:59.670
<v Speaker 1>carving Orthodox Christian icons.</v>

2401
01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:03.000
<v Speaker 1>It's like no one will ever make a living doing that.</v>

2402
01:32:04.200 --> 01:32:08.490
<v Speaker 1>Know he decided that he was going to do exactly what you want to do,</v>

2403
01:32:08.570 --> 01:32:12.400
<v Speaker 1>which you don't want to shatter the conventions of political correctness.</v>

2404
01:32:12.401 --> 01:32:15.490
<v Speaker 1>You want to be an artist and if you are an artist,</v>

2405
01:32:15.610 --> 01:32:19.630
<v Speaker 1>see an artist is also someone who an artist is someone who produces art.</v>

2406
01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:21.850
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's a big mistake.</v>

2407
01:32:22.180 --> 01:32:26.110
<v Speaker 1>And artist is someone who uses our as a tool to investigate the structure of</v>

2408
01:32:26.111 --> 01:32:29.650
<v Speaker 1>reality and to extend the human capacity to perceive.</v>

2409
01:32:29.710 --> 01:32:31.660
<v Speaker 1>That's where the harm ducks and artists</v>

2410
01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:32.381
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>

2411
01:32:32.381 --> 01:32:37.381
<v Speaker 4>really grieving [inaudible] skill</v>

2412
01:32:42.140 --> 01:32:46.040
<v Speaker 1>so that you can extend the limits of the human relationship with beauty and</v>

2413
01:32:46.041 --> 01:32:46.401
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>

2414
01:32:46.401 --> 01:32:50.330
<v Speaker 1>And you can transform the manner in which people perceive so that they can see</v>

2415
01:32:50.331 --> 01:32:52.610
<v Speaker 1>beauty when they only soft memory before.</v>

2416
01:32:52.790 --> 01:32:53.990
<v Speaker 1>That's what you want to do.</v>

2417
01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:55.070
<v Speaker 1>And if you do that,</v>

2418
01:32:55.071 --> 01:32:55.811
<v Speaker 1>then you were an artist.</v>

2419
01:32:55.811 --> 01:32:56.481
<v Speaker 1>Feel shatter,</v>

2420
01:32:56.481 --> 01:32:58.400
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of conventions in the post.</v>

2421
01:32:58.550 --> 01:32:58.941
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2422
01:32:58.941 --> 01:33:01.340
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to just set out to shatter convention.</v>

2423
01:33:01.370 --> 01:33:02.960
<v Speaker 1>That's like breaking the store window.</v>

2424
01:33:02.961 --> 01:33:04.340
<v Speaker 1>Anybody can do that.</v>

2425
01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:05.180
<v Speaker 1>You want to,</v>

2426
01:33:05.180 --> 01:33:08.300
<v Speaker 1>you want to replace them with a better set of conventions.</v>

2427
01:33:08.301 --> 01:33:08.600
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

2428
01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:10.850
<v Speaker 1>that's the right way of transcending one's conventions.</v>

2429
01:33:10.851 --> 01:33:12.020
<v Speaker 1>And you can do that if you,</v>

2430
01:33:12.170 --> 01:33:15.290
<v Speaker 1>if you discipline yourself and to be the true artist.</v>

2431
01:33:15.380 --> 01:33:18.830
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you some things about true artists cause it's no joke.</v>

2432
01:33:19.010 --> 01:33:20.360
<v Speaker 1>So here's thing number one.</v>

2433
01:33:21.020 --> 01:33:24.290
<v Speaker 1>So Johann Johann Sebastian Bach,</v>

2434
01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:25.521
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

2435
01:33:25.521 --> 01:33:30.410
<v Speaker 1>there's about five composers that dominate the classical music world and they</v>

2436
01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:34.430
<v Speaker 1>own these five that's now compared to all the composers who've ever lived.</v>

2437
01:33:34.910 --> 01:33:39.910
<v Speaker 1>And there their works composable half the classical repertoire and only a tiny</v>

2438
01:33:41.601 --> 01:33:44.300
<v Speaker 1>proportion of the works that they wrote our plate.</v>

2439
01:33:44.770 --> 01:33:46.460
<v Speaker 1>And so let's talk about bar,</v>

2440
01:33:46.461 --> 01:33:47.690
<v Speaker 1>cause he's one of the five,</v>

2441
01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:53.080
<v Speaker 1>he wrote so much music that it would take someone 40 years just to copy it by</v>

2442
01:33:55.521 --> 01:33:57.590
<v Speaker 1>hand if they worked eight hour cases.</v>

2443
01:33:58.520 --> 01:33:58.761
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2444
01:33:58.761 --> 01:34:00.020
<v Speaker 1>so just think about that.</v>

2445
01:34:00.021 --> 01:34:01.570
<v Speaker 1>Now let's talk about a castle.</v>

2446
01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:05.930
<v Speaker 1>Think how many pieces of how many paintings,</v>

2447
01:34:05.931 --> 01:34:06.650
<v Speaker 1>sculptures,</v>

2448
01:34:06.650 --> 01:34:09.500
<v Speaker 1>other objects of art didn't because of produce.</v>

2449
01:34:09.860 --> 01:34:10.041
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2450
01:34:10.041 --> 01:34:10.491
<v Speaker 1>let's see,</v>

2451
01:34:10.491 --> 01:34:14.540
<v Speaker 1>he had a 70 year career,</v>

2452
01:34:15.680 --> 01:34:20.680
<v Speaker 1>65,000 he produced three fully form pieces of art a day for 65 years every</v>

2453
01:34:27.140 --> 01:34:27.973
<v Speaker 1>single day.</v>

2454
01:34:28.100 --> 01:34:28.933
<v Speaker 1>So it's just an,</v>

2455
01:34:29.130 --> 01:34:31.940
<v Speaker 1>you think about the Cuban of value of this production,</v>

2456
01:34:31.941 --> 01:34:32.774
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2457
01:34:32.780 --> 01:34:37.160
<v Speaker 1>it's like the Cuban revalue value quick and GDP of a decent size country.</v>

2458
01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:38.353
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely,</v>

2459
01:34:38.540 --> 01:34:38.931
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

2460
01:34:38.931 --> 01:34:40.760
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely phenomenal.</v>

2461
01:34:40.970 --> 01:34:44.480
<v Speaker 1>And so if you want to be an artist and you've got big shoes to fill,</v>

2462
01:34:44.630 --> 01:34:45.140
<v Speaker 1>you want to,</v>

2463
01:34:45.140 --> 01:34:45.320
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2464
01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:50.320
<v Speaker 1>it's the hardest thing to be and you have to be unbelievably disciplined at</v>

2465
01:34:51.300 --> 01:34:51.890
<v Speaker 1>attemptive,</v>

2466
01:34:51.890 --> 01:34:55.430
<v Speaker 1>ACC oriented and exploratory and courageous,</v>

2467
01:34:55.460 --> 01:34:59.750
<v Speaker 1>all of that at sharp on fronts to be an artist that you won't have to worry</v>

2468
01:34:59.751 --> 01:35:03.440
<v Speaker 1>about the conventions of political correctness because those people will be so</v>

2469
01:35:03.441 --> 01:35:06.960
<v Speaker 1>far behind you that you want to be able to see the bedroom door so</v>

2470
01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:13.280
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible].</v>

2471
01:35:16.470 --> 01:35:20.550
<v Speaker 1>When will the Biblical Series Lecture Series Continue?</v>

2472
01:35:20.820 --> 01:35:21.990
<v Speaker 1>December</v>

2473
01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:27.720
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible]</v>

2474
01:35:27.890 --> 01:35:28.071
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

2475
01:35:28.071 --> 01:35:29.010
<v Speaker 1>I did ask you,</v>

2476
01:35:29.011 --> 01:35:31.380
<v Speaker 1>we just rent a small theater in Toronto.</v>

2477
01:35:31.381 --> 01:35:33.780
<v Speaker 1>What I'm going to start doing the,</v>

2478
01:35:34.430 --> 01:35:35.960
<v Speaker 1>the stories of Moses,</v>

2479
01:35:36.330 --> 01:35:40.380
<v Speaker 1>the exodus story is and so forth and I'm really looking forward to that.</v>

2480
01:35:40.381 --> 01:35:45.381
<v Speaker 1>I have a sneaky suspicion that there isn't anything more important that I can do</v>

2481
01:35:45.540 --> 01:35:48.000
<v Speaker 1>then to continue with those biblical lectures,</v>

2482
01:35:48.330 --> 01:35:50.880
<v Speaker 1>but I mean this is good to go around and talk to people.</v>

2483
01:35:50.910 --> 01:35:52.230
<v Speaker 1>This is a really good thing.</v>

2484
01:35:52.610 --> 01:35:52.940
<v Speaker 1>Great,</v>

2485
01:35:52.940 --> 01:35:53.220
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

2486
01:35:53.220 --> 01:35:53.800
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

2487
01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:56.910
<v Speaker 1>but I think it over any reasonable amount of time,</v>

2488
01:35:56.970 --> 01:35:57.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2489
01:35:57.180 --> 01:35:59.280
<v Speaker 1>We have full off to continue to pursue that.</v>

2490
01:35:59.310 --> 01:36:04.260
<v Speaker 1>Partly because there seems to be a real demand for it who were new gas.</v>

2491
01:36:05.640 --> 01:36:07.350
<v Speaker 1>So preposterous.</v>

2492
01:36:08.370 --> 01:36:09.121
<v Speaker 1>It's even worse.</v>

2493
01:36:09.121 --> 01:36:11.950
<v Speaker 1>The Jonathan Passion situation is concerned</v>

2494
01:36:14.070 --> 01:36:16.830
<v Speaker 1>and I learned an unbelievable amount of doing it.</v>

2495
01:36:16.831 --> 01:36:19.190
<v Speaker 1>So I'm really looking forward to starting it up again.</v>

2496
01:36:19.220 --> 01:36:22.200
<v Speaker 1>So if the plan right now is to do that December and so,</v>

2497
01:36:22.450 --> 01:36:23.570
<v Speaker 1>so well,</v>

2498
01:36:23.571 --> 01:36:24.404
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>

2499
01:36:24.540 --> 01:36:25.260
<v Speaker 1>that's the answer.</v>

2500
01:36:25.260 --> 01:36:26.130
<v Speaker 1>That question.</v>

2501
01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:31.320
<v Speaker 1>So how can we be sure that we are not in cold?</v>

2502
01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:32.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about you.</v>

2503
01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:39.673
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2504
01:36:41.070 --> 01:36:42.510
<v Speaker 1>Convince me please.</v>

2505
01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:44.060
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2506
01:36:44.060 --> 01:36:44.670
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2507
01:36:44.670 --> 01:36:45.503
<v Speaker 1>Like look,</v>

2508
01:36:46.070 --> 01:36:49.410
<v Speaker 1>there are where there are ways you know that you're in a cold</v>

2509
01:36:51.530 --> 01:36:55.470
<v Speaker 1>call just and just some little system of belief or something like that.</v>

2510
01:36:55.490 --> 01:36:55.841
<v Speaker 1>Call it.</v>

2511
01:36:55.841 --> 01:36:59.540
<v Speaker 1>Does it called when there are people who study colts,</v>

2512
01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:00.630
<v Speaker 1>they sorted the assignment.</v>

2513
01:37:00.660 --> 01:37:03.230
<v Speaker 1>Maybe one is a cold leader,</v>

2514
01:37:03.270 --> 01:37:06.000
<v Speaker 1>a chief from your family and friends.</v>

2515
01:37:06.180 --> 01:37:09.720
<v Speaker 1>Because one of the rules of the in a cold is you don't get to associate with</v>

2516
01:37:09.721 --> 01:37:11.460
<v Speaker 1>anyone who is getting the cold.</v>

2517
01:37:11.730 --> 01:37:12.061
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2518
01:37:12.061 --> 01:37:16.260
<v Speaker 1>So are you being alienated from your faculty and ceramics</v>

2519
01:37:18.020 --> 01:37:19.890
<v Speaker 1>or maybe you're giving that to yourself.</v>

2520
01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:20.753
<v Speaker 1>That's your brother.</v>

2521
01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:23.540
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2522
01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:25.160
<v Speaker 1>so if you're speaking about,</v>

2523
01:37:25.220 --> 01:37:25.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2524
01:37:25.700 --> 01:37:27.170
<v Speaker 1>paying attention to what I've been saying,</v>

2525
01:37:27.171 --> 01:37:30.260
<v Speaker 1>I haven't told you to alienate yourself from your family and friends.</v>

2526
01:37:30.261 --> 01:37:30.840
<v Speaker 1>I told him,</v>

2527
01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:35.030
<v Speaker 1>you get your bloody act together so that you're good for your family and your</v>

2528
01:37:35.031 --> 01:37:35.391
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>

2529
01:37:35.391 --> 01:37:37.080
<v Speaker 1>That's like the opposite of a call.</v>

2530
01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:42.910
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] the</v>

2531
01:37:45.430 --> 01:37:49.240
<v Speaker 1>next thing is the coal of Coleen and takes all your time and money.</v>

2532
01:37:50.590 --> 01:37:55.590
<v Speaker 1>I haven't taken all your money and I have taken all your time with three primary</v>

2533
01:37:56.371 --> 01:37:59.570
<v Speaker 1>dimensions of call time batting zero.</v>

2534
01:37:59.910 --> 01:38:00.743
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2535
01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:01.620
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

2536
01:38:01.620 --> 01:38:02.470
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>

2537
01:38:02.730 --> 01:38:03.950
<v Speaker 1>it's ridiculous.</v>

2538
01:38:03.970 --> 01:38:05.240
<v Speaker 1>It's a ridiculous,</v>

2539
01:38:05.540 --> 01:38:10.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean understand the comparison because obviously there's something about this</v>

2540
01:38:10.741 --> 01:38:15.690
<v Speaker 1>set of ideas that has a compounding nature of some manner.</v>

2541
01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:19.020
<v Speaker 1>You have every reason to be skeptical and Leery of that.</v>

2542
01:38:19.110 --> 01:38:19.280
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2543
01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:22.470
<v Speaker 1>when I tell my students at the beginning of point maps or maybe quarters that</v>

2544
01:38:22.471 --> 01:38:26.730
<v Speaker 1>they should do everything they possibly can to fight everything they possibly</v>

2545
01:38:26.731 --> 01:38:28.260
<v Speaker 1>can wrong about what I tell him,</v>

2546
01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:29.750
<v Speaker 1>that's their job.</v>

2547
01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:31.193
<v Speaker 4>So listen,</v>

2548
01:38:35.990 --> 01:38:36.471
<v Speaker 1>tell me,</v>

2549
01:38:36.471 --> 01:38:37.490
<v Speaker 1>because if it's wrong,</v>

2550
01:38:37.491 --> 01:38:38.390
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to fix it.</v>

2551
01:38:38.530 --> 01:38:39.363
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

2552
01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:43.580
<v Speaker 1>so I don't think that a call can be built on,</v>

2553
01:38:43.850 --> 01:38:44.683
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2554
01:38:44.690 --> 01:38:48.110
<v Speaker 1>a message of fundamental individual responsibility.</v>

2555
01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:49.393
<v Speaker 1>I think that's it.</v>

2556
01:38:52.530 --> 01:38:54.600
<v Speaker 1>You think it's a bit cold of individuals?</v>

2557
01:38:54.970 --> 01:38:55.803
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2558
01:38:58.760 --> 01:39:01.460
<v Speaker 1>so it's good that you're skeptical.</v>

2559
01:39:01.461 --> 01:39:03.620
<v Speaker 1>It's good that you're asking that question but,</v>

2560
01:39:03.870 --> 01:39:05.530
<v Speaker 1>but the code comparison isn't,</v>

2561
01:39:05.780 --> 01:39:10.130
<v Speaker 1>is the good one because what for the reasons I just said the course does it as</v>

2562
01:39:10.131 --> 01:39:10.730
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

2563
01:39:10.730 --> 01:39:14.720
<v Speaker 1>Is there reason to be skeptical of the ideas that are putting forth?</v>

2564
01:39:14.721 --> 01:39:15.291
<v Speaker 1>And I would say,</v>

2565
01:39:15.291 --> 01:39:16.310
<v Speaker 1>well of course there is.</v>

2566
01:39:16.311 --> 01:39:17.051
<v Speaker 1>You should be scared.</v>

2567
01:39:17.051 --> 01:39:18.020
<v Speaker 1>People have ideas.</v>

2568
01:39:18.350 --> 01:39:22.940
<v Speaker 1>But I would also say you should give some consideration for the fact that these</v>

2569
01:39:22.941 --> 01:39:25.160
<v Speaker 1>aren't precise and it's by ideas.</v>

2570
01:39:25.161 --> 01:39:25.371
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2571
01:39:25.371 --> 01:39:30.371
<v Speaker 1>what I be trying to do is aggregate a set of great ideas that [inaudible] that'd</v>

2572
01:39:30.980 --> 01:39:31.640
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

2573
01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:32.450
<v Speaker 1>what would it be?</v>

2574
01:39:32.450 --> 01:39:34.440
<v Speaker 1>They'd been handed down historically.</v>

2575
01:39:34.470 --> 01:39:34.941
<v Speaker 1>Some of them,</v>

2576
01:39:34.941 --> 01:39:38.690
<v Speaker 1>it'll be discovered scientific again to try to present those in a compelling</v>

2577
01:39:38.691 --> 01:39:41.000
<v Speaker 1>form to put old wine in new bottles,</v>

2578
01:39:41.001 --> 01:39:41.834
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

2579
01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:45.810
<v Speaker 1>But you of course you want to be skeptical about that at watchful time.</v>

2580
01:39:46.310 --> 01:39:47.143
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>

2581
01:39:48.370 --> 01:39:51.640
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that it's a colt and it doesn't mean necessarily that</v>

2582
01:39:51.641 --> 01:39:53.020
<v Speaker 1>there's any intrinsic page.</v>

2583
01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:56.620
<v Speaker 1>I guess the other thing that you want to figure out is they say part of their</v>

2584
01:39:56.621 --> 01:39:57.071
<v Speaker 1>fruits,</v>

2585
01:39:57.071 --> 01:40:01.150
<v Speaker 1>you shall know that that's the statement in the New Testament is like if you've</v>

2586
01:40:01.151 --> 01:40:05.310
<v Speaker 1>been listening to these lectures and you keep putting the principles into</v>

2587
01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:05.891
<v Speaker 1>practice,</v>

2588
01:40:05.891 --> 01:40:09.450
<v Speaker 1>you can develop a vision for your own life and taking more responsibility and</v>

2589
01:40:09.451 --> 01:40:10.360
<v Speaker 1>trying to tell the truth.</v>

2590
01:40:10.690 --> 01:40:12.940
<v Speaker 1>What's the consequence of that?</v>

2591
01:40:13.510 --> 01:40:15.840
<v Speaker 1>Like when people talk to me all the time,</v>

2592
01:40:15.850 --> 01:40:16.171
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

2593
01:40:16.171 --> 01:40:17.500
<v Speaker 1>what things are better for me?</v>

2594
01:40:17.501 --> 01:40:17.891
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2595
01:40:17.891 --> 01:40:19.990
<v Speaker 1>well good if they're better for you.</v>

2596
01:40:20.050 --> 01:40:21.540
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they're a for you and your staff,</v>

2597
01:40:21.620 --> 01:40:24.580
<v Speaker 1>the better for you and the people you have intimate relationships with.</v>

2598
01:40:24.581 --> 01:40:25.414
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2599
01:40:25.510 --> 01:40:26.291
<v Speaker 1>that's good,</v>

2600
01:40:26.291 --> 01:40:27.430
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>

2601
01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:30.380
<v Speaker 1>That's a good diagnostic diagnostic indicator.</v>

2602
01:40:30.580 --> 01:40:34.510
<v Speaker 1>If you try out the ideas and they make things better,</v>

2603
01:40:34.570 --> 01:40:39.570
<v Speaker 1>then well that seems to be good piece of evidence and that's what I would watch</v>

2604
01:40:39.761 --> 01:40:42.670
<v Speaker 1>for and you could make up your own mind.</v>

2605
01:40:42.910 --> 01:40:44.680
<v Speaker 1>Stay skeptical whether you're doing it.</v>

2606
01:40:45.190 --> 01:40:46.023
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2607
01:40:47.700 --> 01:40:48.533
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2608
01:40:52.500 --> 01:40:52.801
<v Speaker 1>why are you,</v>

2609
01:40:52.801 --> 01:40:53.970
<v Speaker 1>does message maybe</v>

2610
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:55.540
<v Speaker 4>resonate with white people?</v>

2611
01:40:57.490 --> 01:40:57.980
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2612
01:40:57.980 --> 01:41:00.920
<v Speaker 1>There's no evidence for that so well,</v>

2613
01:41:01.140 --> 01:41:04.090
<v Speaker 1>so it's not a question the answer properly.</v>

2614
01:41:04.380 --> 01:41:05.410
<v Speaker 1>Zachary ticket's gone,</v>

2615
01:41:05.420 --> 01:41:07.170
<v Speaker 1>we'd question that's not posed problem.</v>

2616
01:41:07.530 --> 01:41:09.870
<v Speaker 1>What's your evidence that it does</v>

2617
01:41:11.620 --> 01:41:13.610
<v Speaker 1>to make a question like that,</v>

2618
01:41:13.620 --> 01:41:14.780
<v Speaker 1>which is actually kind of act.</v>

2619
01:41:14.790 --> 01:41:17.540
<v Speaker 1>You say you should get in in short packs.</v>

2620
01:41:17.550 --> 01:41:20.010
<v Speaker 1>Like it's just like what's your evidence for that?</v>

2621
01:41:20.550 --> 01:41:22.170
<v Speaker 1>So you don't have any evidence then?</v>

2622
01:41:23.430 --> 01:41:27.240
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean mainly exactly cause we're going to be exactly about this.</v>

2623
01:41:27.241 --> 01:41:29.730
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's probably a black person out here.</v>

2624
01:41:29.731 --> 01:41:30.401
<v Speaker 1>It's like what are you gonna do?</v>

2625
01:41:30.401 --> 01:41:31.870
<v Speaker 1>Go back.</v>

2626
01:41:34.470 --> 01:41:35.303
<v Speaker 1>Nope,</v>

2627
01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:36.720
<v Speaker 1>that's not a good question.</v>

2628
01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:42.440
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible]</v>

2629
01:41:46.900 --> 01:41:51.010
<v Speaker 1>what do you think is the great risk threat towards Western society?</v>

2630
01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:54.970
<v Speaker 1>Your unresolved weaknesses of the errors?</v>

2631
01:42:00.490 --> 01:42:01.323
<v Speaker 4>Most</v>

2632
01:42:02.040 --> 01:42:03.300
<v Speaker 1>I need that particular,</v>

2633
01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:07.540
<v Speaker 1>it's like the waste is predicated on the idea of the divinity of the individual</v>

2634
01:42:07.541 --> 01:42:10.660
<v Speaker 1>and that's mostly associated with individual responsibility.</v>

2635
01:42:11.020 --> 01:42:14.080
<v Speaker 1>And so to the degree that you abdicate that responsibility,</v>

2636
01:42:14.081 --> 01:42:14.920
<v Speaker 1>you're the threat.</v>

2637
01:42:15.330 --> 01:42:16.600
<v Speaker 1>It's as simple as that.</v>

2638
01:42:17.900 --> 01:42:22.900
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible]</v>

2639
01:42:24.450 --> 01:42:27.630
<v Speaker 1>is the corner for sustainable long term.</v>

2640
01:42:29.270 --> 01:42:29.870
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2641
01:42:29.870 --> 01:42:34.760
<v Speaker 1>I suspect that sometime in the next 50 years I'm going to die.</v>

2642
01:42:34.890 --> 01:42:35.723
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2643
01:42:48.860 --> 01:42:51.980
<v Speaker 1>You say it would take you 3.5 more years?</v>

2644
01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:56.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it was that precise to answer the question of Christianity Slash</v>

2645
01:42:56.480 --> 01:42:56.871
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

2646
01:42:56.871 --> 01:42:58.130
<v Speaker 1>Slash Jesus.</v>

2647
01:42:58.190 --> 01:43:01.340
<v Speaker 1>Is this an honest answer out of respect or a non answer?</v>

2648
01:43:01.910 --> 01:43:02.743
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2649
01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:03.410
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2650
01:43:03.410 --> 01:43:05.330
<v Speaker 1>it's a vague gas,</v>

2651
01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:06.193
<v Speaker 1>first of all.</v>

2652
01:43:06.450 --> 01:43:07.283
<v Speaker 1>Maybe</v>

2653
01:43:09.230 --> 01:43:14.230
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of things that I have to prepared myself properly to talk about and</v>

2654
01:43:14.820 --> 01:43:15.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2655
01:43:15.250 --> 01:43:15.801
<v Speaker 1>I'm making,</v>

2656
01:43:15.801 --> 01:43:17.960
<v Speaker 1>making my way through these biblical lectures.</v>

2657
01:43:17.961 --> 01:43:21.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how far I'll get with them because God only knows what happens in</v>

2658
01:43:21.410 --> 01:43:22.243
<v Speaker 1>lights,</v>

2659
01:43:22.250 --> 01:43:26.600
<v Speaker 1>but I can't answer questions that I don't want how to answer and so it is an</v>

2660
01:43:26.601 --> 01:43:28.640
<v Speaker 1>honest answer is out of respect.</v>

2661
01:43:29.550 --> 01:43:29.870
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2662
01:43:29.870 --> 01:43:32.090
<v Speaker 1>it's sounding great condition perhaps,</v>

2663
01:43:32.091 --> 01:43:34.340
<v Speaker 1>but mostly it's on the recognition of my homie,</v>

2664
01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:35.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2665
01:43:35.320 --> 01:43:37.190
<v Speaker 1>with the things that they talked to you about tonight.</v>

2666
01:43:37.940 --> 01:43:39.110
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>

2667
01:43:39.700 --> 01:43:43.460
<v Speaker 1>I understand that completely because no one understands anything completely.</v>

2668
01:43:43.790 --> 01:43:45.820
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm on solid ground.</v>

2669
01:43:45.850 --> 01:43:48.160
<v Speaker 1>W W with regards to what I talked to you tonight,</v>

2670
01:43:48.170 --> 01:43:52.880
<v Speaker 1>like I know the literature on perception well enough to tell you about it and to</v>

2671
01:43:52.881 --> 01:43:56.690
<v Speaker 1>tell you about how that's related to emotions and motivation and to,</v>

2672
01:43:56.740 --> 01:44:00.410
<v Speaker 1>to lay out the relationship between value and perception and all of that.</v>

2673
01:44:00.411 --> 01:44:01.670
<v Speaker 1>Because I've done the work,</v>

2674
01:44:01.671 --> 01:44:01.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2675
01:44:01.911 --> 01:44:02.990
<v Speaker 1>I've read the papers,</v>

2676
01:44:03.470 --> 01:44:05.390
<v Speaker 1>I've written in the papers for that,</v>

2677
01:44:05.391 --> 01:44:06.050
<v Speaker 1>proud,</v>

2678
01:44:06.050 --> 01:44:08.150
<v Speaker 1>I've done the work and so I'm on solid ground,</v>

2679
01:44:08.151 --> 01:44:11.300
<v Speaker 1>but there's lots of things that exceed my capacity.</v>

2680
01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:12.001
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2681
01:44:12.001 --> 01:44:12.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2682
01:44:12.430 --> 01:44:13.070
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2683
01:44:13.070 --> 01:44:15.080
<v Speaker 1>I do believe that are,</v>

2684
01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:15.441
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2685
01:44:15.441 --> 01:44:15.691
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2686
01:44:15.691 --> 01:44:17.120
<v Speaker 1>I believe that our functional,</v>

2687
01:44:17.121 --> 01:44:21.290
<v Speaker 1>highly functional Western societies are grounded in the Judeo Christian ethic.</v>

2688
01:44:21.620 --> 01:44:25.220
<v Speaker 1>And then fundamentally that's a religious effort and that it makes a number of</v>

2689
01:44:25.221 --> 01:44:26.570
<v Speaker 1>metaphysical claims.</v>

2690
01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:30.050
<v Speaker 1>So I have great respect for the ethic and for the stories,</v>

2691
01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:33.140
<v Speaker 1>but I'm unable to assess the metaphysical claims.</v>

2692
01:44:33.140 --> 01:44:35.540
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is I ate urine.</v>

2693
01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:37.160
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know enough.</v>

2694
01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:41.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand the wellhouse way with regard to the idea of the death and</v>

2695
01:44:41.361 --> 01:44:42.520
<v Speaker 1>resurrection of Christ.</v>

2696
01:44:42.521 --> 01:44:45.710
<v Speaker 1>Like I deemed that psychologically and symbolically.</v>

2697
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:50.330
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't mean that I think that exhausts the store cause I don't believe</v>

2698
01:44:50.331 --> 01:44:52.220
<v Speaker 1>that my knowledge exhaust the story.</v>

2699
01:44:52.370 --> 01:44:53.001
<v Speaker 1>But I believe,</v>

2700
01:44:53.001 --> 01:44:53.691
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

2701
01:44:53.691 --> 01:44:58.610
<v Speaker 1>that the part of you that's capable of transcending tragedy and malevolence is</v>

2702
01:44:58.611 --> 01:44:59.690
<v Speaker 1>the part that dies.</v>

2703
01:44:59.691 --> 01:45:00.650
<v Speaker 1>It is reborn.</v>

2704
01:45:01.010 --> 01:45:03.530
<v Speaker 1>You have to leave the corrupt parts of yourself behind.</v>

2705
01:45:03.531 --> 01:45:07.610
<v Speaker 1>You have to let those burn off and you have to let your spirit be renewed</v>

2706
01:45:07.611 --> 01:45:08.570
<v Speaker 1>continually.</v>

2707
01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:09.860
<v Speaker 1>And that's an ancient story.</v>

2708
01:45:09.861 --> 01:45:13.820
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that has affinity with the idea of the dying and resurrected.</v>

2709
01:45:13.821 --> 01:45:17.540
<v Speaker 1>See now I don't think that exhausts the idea,</v>

2710
01:45:17.570 --> 01:45:19.780
<v Speaker 1>but that's as far as I've been able to push it.</v>

2711
01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:21.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean in my wildest moments,</v>

2712
01:45:21.670 --> 01:45:23.570
<v Speaker 1>and this is speculation,</v>

2713
01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:23.871
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2714
01:45:23.871 --> 01:45:24.890
<v Speaker 1>This is speculation.</v>

2715
01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:29.920
<v Speaker 1>I think the idea that Christ died for our sins and that mankind was redeemed is</v>

2716
01:45:31.101 --> 01:45:32.090
<v Speaker 1>correct,</v>

2717
01:45:32.180 --> 01:45:33.950
<v Speaker 1>but we still have to do the work.</v>

2718
01:45:34.310 --> 01:45:35.750
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

2719
01:45:35.830 --> 01:45:39.490
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a benefit statement and I don't understand the whole,</v>

2720
01:45:39.700 --> 01:45:40.533
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2721
01:45:41.420 --> 01:45:41.781
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2722
01:45:41.781 --> 01:45:45.950
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm talking about things that no one can know of in some sense.</v>

2723
01:45:46.130 --> 01:45:49.260
<v Speaker 1>But when I pushed myself up to the limits of my knowledge and ask,</v>

2724
01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:51.870
<v Speaker 1>that's the sort of answer that comes to me.</v>

2725
01:45:51.950 --> 01:45:56.090
<v Speaker 1>It's like there is something about the idea of the,</v>

2726
01:45:56.150 --> 01:45:58.870
<v Speaker 1>of the individual sacrificing himself for that.</v>

2727
01:45:59.170 --> 01:46:02.120
<v Speaker 1>So we're taking the sins of mankind to himself.</v>

2728
01:46:02.121 --> 01:46:03.710
<v Speaker 1>There's a written that's real idea.</v>

2729
01:46:03.860 --> 01:46:07.220
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's what people shouldn't do is that in some senses that you're</v>

2730
01:46:07.221 --> 01:46:10.130
<v Speaker 1>responsible for the catastrophe of the world.</v>

2731
01:46:10.340 --> 01:46:11.510
<v Speaker 1>I believe that.</v>

2732
01:46:11.570 --> 01:46:16.100
<v Speaker 1>And I also believe that taking that one the fullest possible way,</v>

2733
01:46:16.101 --> 01:46:18.830
<v Speaker 1>we transform you beyond recognition.</v>

2734
01:46:19.010 --> 01:46:22.370
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know what the ultimate limit of that is because you could say that</v>

2735
01:46:23.120 --> 01:46:25.670
<v Speaker 1>the story of the death and resurrection is a living story.</v>

2736
01:46:25.671 --> 01:46:27.200
<v Speaker 1>Like the story of the crucifixion.</v>

2737
01:46:27.230 --> 01:46:32.180
<v Speaker 1>The crucifixion is suffering that can't be exceeded in some sense because it's</v>

2738
01:46:32.181 --> 01:46:35.330
<v Speaker 1>the most possible suffering for the most innocent possible person.</v>

2739
01:46:35.540 --> 01:46:37.040
<v Speaker 1>So that's the perfect tragedy,</v>

2740
01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:38.353
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2741
01:46:38.390 --> 01:46:40.820
<v Speaker 1>And so there's an idea that whenever Christ is,</v>

2742
01:46:40.821 --> 01:46:43.970
<v Speaker 1>is that which takes on the tragedy of the world in that which confronts</v>

2743
01:46:43.971 --> 01:46:45.410
<v Speaker 1>malevolence and overcomes it.</v>

2744
01:46:45.740 --> 01:46:46.230
<v Speaker 1>And I I,</v>

2745
01:46:46.230 --> 01:46:47.440
<v Speaker 1>that's the story of Christ.</v>

2746
01:46:47.490 --> 01:46:47.990
<v Speaker 1>The dessert,</v>

2747
01:46:47.990 --> 01:46:48.630
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

2748
01:46:48.630 --> 01:46:49.830
<v Speaker 1>the account per se,</v>

2749
01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:54.780
<v Speaker 1>and the story that Risa fiction is the willingness to bear that catastrophe of</v>

2750
01:46:54.781 --> 01:46:56.190
<v Speaker 1>existence voluntary.</v>

2751
01:46:56.610 --> 01:47:01.110
<v Speaker 1>And there's an idea that doing that produces a kind of transfiguration.</v>

2752
01:47:01.140 --> 01:47:02.940
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's all true,</v>

2753
01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:07.710
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know what the limits of that truth are and sort of pushing it as far</v>

2754
01:47:07.711 --> 01:47:10.190
<v Speaker 1>as I possibly can within that domain acquired them.</v>

2755
01:47:10.191 --> 01:47:11.080
<v Speaker 1>It didn't understand me,</v>

2756
01:47:11.081 --> 01:47:12.630
<v Speaker 1>but I can't push it past that.</v>

2757
01:47:12.631 --> 01:47:17.631
<v Speaker 1>And so I know I have 300 books stacked up at home that I need to read.</v>

2758
01:47:17.821 --> 01:47:18.031
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2759
01:47:18.031 --> 01:47:23.031
<v Speaker 1>the people that be sending me to get through this more deeply than I have been</v>

2760
01:47:23.191 --> 01:47:24.570
<v Speaker 1>able to get through it so far.</v>

2761
01:47:24.571 --> 01:47:26.010
<v Speaker 1>It's so it's,</v>

2762
01:47:26.040 --> 01:47:30.150
<v Speaker 1>it's recognition of my ignorance and it's respect for the complexity of the</v>

2763
01:47:30.151 --> 01:47:30.900
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

2764
01:47:30.900 --> 01:47:31.740
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

2765
01:47:31.741 --> 01:47:31.981
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2766
01:47:31.981 --> 01:47:32.640
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

2767
01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:34.140
<v Speaker 1>three years or four years,</v>

2768
01:47:34.141 --> 01:47:37.490
<v Speaker 1>that was just an estimate based on how quickly I'd be going through the paper</v>

2769
01:47:37.491 --> 01:47:38.131
<v Speaker 1>called stories.</v>

2770
01:47:38.131 --> 01:47:42.150
<v Speaker 1>But God only knows if I get any deeper into it than I've already been able to</v>

2771
01:47:42.151 --> 01:47:42.984
<v Speaker 1>find out.</v>

2772
01:47:43.170 --> 01:47:45.060
<v Speaker 1>So that's my answer I guess.</v>

2773
01:47:52.190 --> 01:47:52.401
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2774
01:47:52.401 --> 01:47:52.611
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

2775
01:47:52.611 --> 01:47:56.960
<v Speaker 1>A behavioral therapy seems to be the most widely implemented theoretical</v>

2776
01:47:56.961 --> 01:48:00.620
<v Speaker 1>orientation in our practice and clinical practice.</v>

2777
01:48:00.621 --> 01:48:03.560
<v Speaker 1>What's your primary modality in therapy with clients?</v>

2778
01:48:03.740 --> 01:48:05.810
<v Speaker 1>I behaviors you get with,</v>

2779
01:48:05.950 --> 01:48:08.020
<v Speaker 1>because I look for simple solutions.</v>

2780
01:48:08.050 --> 01:48:08.883
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2781
01:48:08.990 --> 01:48:09.261
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2782
01:48:09.261 --> 01:48:10.094
<v Speaker 1>let's see,</v>

2783
01:48:10.730 --> 01:48:13.520
<v Speaker 1>before we get old psychoanalytic on people let me,</v>

2784
01:48:13.550 --> 01:48:14.000
<v Speaker 1>he wanted,</v>

2785
01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.490
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to save that and the union stuff for,</v>

2786
01:48:16.510 --> 01:48:19.220
<v Speaker 1>for exceptional circumstances as far as I'm concerned.</v>

2787
01:48:19.730 --> 01:48:21.230
<v Speaker 1>If a client comes to me,</v>

2788
01:48:21.470 --> 01:48:21.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2789
01:48:21.890 --> 01:48:22.970
<v Speaker 1>here's the situation.</v>

2790
01:48:23.180 --> 01:48:25.870
<v Speaker 1>Someone comes to me and uh,</v>

2791
01:48:26.450 --> 01:48:29.510
<v Speaker 1>it's because their life is going the way that it needs to go.</v>

2792
01:48:29.750 --> 01:48:31.160
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise they would be there.</v>

2793
01:48:31.740 --> 01:48:35.780
<v Speaker 1>And so I think walnuts decompose the problem.</v>

2794
01:48:36.890 --> 01:48:37.461
<v Speaker 1>Why are you,</v>

2795
01:48:37.461 --> 01:48:37.970
<v Speaker 1>what happened?</v>

2796
01:48:37.970 --> 01:48:38.340
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

2797
01:48:38.340 --> 01:48:38.851
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

2798
01:48:38.851 --> 01:48:41.150
<v Speaker 1>What does your unhappiness system?</v>

2799
01:48:41.780 --> 01:48:43.970
<v Speaker 1>So that would take a lot of conversation.</v>

2800
01:48:43.971 --> 01:48:45.110
<v Speaker 1>That's the diagnosis.</v>

2801
01:48:45.111 --> 01:48:45.501
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2802
01:48:45.501 --> 01:48:46.334
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2803
01:48:47.110 --> 01:48:48.100
<v Speaker 1>do you have a good friends?</v>

2804
01:48:48.110 --> 01:48:49.270
<v Speaker 1>How are you doing with your family?</v>

2805
01:48:49.290 --> 01:48:50.450
<v Speaker 1>How's your career going?</v>

2806
01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:56.420
<v Speaker 1>Are you are attended to your education or you attended to your mental and</v>

2807
01:48:56.421 --> 01:48:57.254
<v Speaker 1>physical health?</v>

2808
01:48:57.530 --> 01:49:01.700
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a productive and useful use for your time outside of work?</v>

2809
01:49:01.740 --> 01:49:05.930
<v Speaker 1>And Are you swamped quite temptations like drug and alcohol use or sexual</v>

2810
01:49:05.931 --> 01:49:06.764
<v Speaker 1>misbehavior?</v>

2811
01:49:06.980 --> 01:49:08.330
<v Speaker 1>It's good way of deconstructing.</v>

2812
01:49:08.390 --> 01:49:10.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like how are you doing on all those dimensions?</v>

2813
01:49:10.730 --> 01:49:12.680
<v Speaker 1>If you do mind future authoring program,</v>

2814
01:49:12.681 --> 01:49:13.220
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

2815
01:49:13.220 --> 01:49:14.450
<v Speaker 1>which is part of this so far,</v>

2816
01:49:14.451 --> 01:49:15.284
<v Speaker 1>three suite,</v>

2817
01:49:15.540 --> 01:49:17.630
<v Speaker 1>then it will ask you all locals questions.</v>

2818
01:49:17.780 --> 01:49:19.340
<v Speaker 1>And so if you want to do it,</v>

2819
01:49:19.430 --> 01:49:21.350
<v Speaker 1>I made a discount for all of you.</v>

2820
01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:22.520
<v Speaker 1>He could use a cold call,</v>

2821
01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:26.720
<v Speaker 1>12 rules that would knock the price down by 50% just so you know.</v>

2822
01:49:26.990 --> 01:49:28.010
<v Speaker 1>But we tried to,</v>

2823
01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:32.450
<v Speaker 1>I tried to put the essence of useful behavioral clinic,</v>

2824
01:49:32.550 --> 01:49:34.680
<v Speaker 1>Ricardo Behavioral Technical Practices to,</v>

2825
01:49:34.970 --> 01:49:35.181
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2826
01:49:35.181 --> 01:49:37.420
<v Speaker 1>an exercise that people can do on the wrong.</v>

2827
01:49:37.970 --> 01:49:42.970
<v Speaker 1>So I want to find out exactly what is your problem as far as your concern.</v>

2828
01:49:44.330 --> 01:49:48.130
<v Speaker 1>And then when we want to be respectful at the simplest possible solutions.</v>

2829
01:49:48.910 --> 01:49:51.310
<v Speaker 1>And so I start from the bar.</v>

2830
01:49:51.340 --> 01:49:52.780
<v Speaker 1>Simple solutions,</v>

2831
01:49:52.840 --> 01:49:53.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2832
01:49:53.340 --> 01:49:54.173
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

2833
01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:54.590
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2834
01:49:54.590 --> 01:49:57.430
<v Speaker 1>maybe you badly only shape physically and that's contributing to your</v>

2835
01:49:57.431 --> 01:49:58.010
<v Speaker 1>compression.</v>

2836
01:49:58.010 --> 01:49:58.360
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2837
01:49:58.360 --> 01:49:59.193
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2838
01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:00.850
<v Speaker 1>how much exercise do you do?</v>

2839
01:50:01.290 --> 01:50:02.740
<v Speaker 1>I'll get you to track that for a week.</v>

2840
01:50:02.741 --> 01:50:03.700
<v Speaker 1>Don't change anything.</v>

2841
01:50:03.701 --> 01:50:05.710
<v Speaker 1>Just to see how much walking you do.</v>

2842
01:50:06.050 --> 01:50:06.511
<v Speaker 1>So I call,</v>

2843
01:50:06.511 --> 01:50:08.950
<v Speaker 1>I have walked like half a mile this week.</v>

2844
01:50:08.951 --> 01:50:09.281
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2845
01:50:09.281 --> 01:50:09.581
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2846
01:50:09.581 --> 01:50:10.660
<v Speaker 1>well how about next week?</v>

2847
01:50:10.661 --> 01:50:13.420
<v Speaker 1>You try walking six tenths of a mile,</v>

2848
01:50:13.830 --> 01:50:14.170
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2849
01:50:14.170 --> 01:50:15.040
<v Speaker 1>Incremental,</v>

2850
01:50:15.041 --> 01:50:15.671
<v Speaker 1>small,</v>

2851
01:50:15.671 --> 01:50:17.380
<v Speaker 1>incremental behavioral groups.</v>

2852
01:50:17.800 --> 01:50:21.340
<v Speaker 1>It's a very straightforward way to help people and it's a pretty useful way and</v>

2853
01:50:21.341 --> 01:50:23.220
<v Speaker 1>you should try the simplest possible way.</v>

2854
01:50:23.221 --> 01:50:25.240
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I like the behavioral approach.</v>

2855
01:50:25.630 --> 01:50:26.710
<v Speaker 1>Now I have clients,</v>

2856
01:50:26.711 --> 01:50:28.090
<v Speaker 1>usually the ones who are creative,</v>

2857
01:50:28.091 --> 01:50:33.091
<v Speaker 1>who also benefit tremendously from UV and approach more symbolic approach.</v>

2858
01:50:33.491 --> 01:50:37.470
<v Speaker 1>They are often people dream a tremendous and who are creative in their,</v>

2859
01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:42.480
<v Speaker 1>from their essence and our use that when it's appropriate and necessary.</v>

2860
01:50:43.121 --> 01:50:43.954
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>

2861
01:50:44.190 --> 01:50:45.160
<v Speaker 1>that's rare.</v>

2862
01:50:45.450 --> 01:50:47.500
<v Speaker 1>So this is very noisy,</v>

2863
01:50:47.501 --> 01:50:48.334
<v Speaker 1>this thing.</v>

2864
01:50:49.900 --> 01:50:51.160
<v Speaker 1>So like me,</v>

2865
01:50:51.161 --> 01:50:51.994
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

2866
01:50:52.180 --> 01:50:52.960
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2867
01:50:52.960 --> 01:50:53.793
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2868
01:50:55.840 --> 01:50:56.650
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>

2869
01:50:56.650 --> 01:50:56.831
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2870
01:50:56.831 --> 01:51:00.400
<v Speaker 1>now this could be the loudest one because I have to stop at some point.</v>

2871
01:51:00.610 --> 01:51:01.443
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2872
01:51:01.870 --> 01:51:04.600
<v Speaker 1>do you have any advice for students studying psychology?</v>

2873
01:51:05.380 --> 01:51:06.213
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2874
01:51:06.460 --> 01:51:07.390
<v Speaker 1>Go to my website.</v>

2875
01:51:07.970 --> 01:51:08.803
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2876
01:51:10.420 --> 01:51:15.420
<v Speaker 1>Reading list there of the best books that I've found in my studies as a</v>

2877
01:51:15.781 --> 01:51:16.501
<v Speaker 1>psychologist,</v>

2878
01:51:16.501 --> 01:51:17.700
<v Speaker 1>there's about 20 of them.</v>

2879
01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:22.540
<v Speaker 1>Go read those books and that'll put you head and shoulders ahead.</v>

2880
01:51:23.940 --> 01:51:28.940
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of them are logs because psychologists pressure the animals.</v>

2881
01:51:29.250 --> 01:51:32.520
<v Speaker 1>Experimental psychologists at the neuroscience is a great strides and</v>

2882
01:51:32.521 --> 01:51:34.590
<v Speaker 1>understanding the way the brain works.</v>

2883
01:51:34.591 --> 01:51:36.520
<v Speaker 1>He really need to know about that cause it's,</v>

2884
01:51:36.521 --> 01:51:39.200
<v Speaker 1>it's profound and interesting and relevant to net.</v>

2885
01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:41.790
<v Speaker 1>There's a list of books written by the great clinicians.</v>

2886
01:51:41.830 --> 01:51:43.740
<v Speaker 1>I think they're unbelievably useful as well.</v>

2887
01:51:43.741 --> 01:51:48.270
<v Speaker 1>So we'll read all those books that if you want to understand the psychology</v>

2888
01:51:48.280 --> 01:51:49.113
<v Speaker 1>that'll read that.</v>

2889
01:51:49.560 --> 01:51:50.393
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>

2890
01:51:50.730 --> 01:51:52.440
<v Speaker 1>So this one,</v>

2891
01:51:52.550 --> 01:51:53.040
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

2892
01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:53.873
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Peterson,</v>

2893
01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:55.890
<v Speaker 1>what do you do to relax and have a good time?</v>

2894
01:51:55.950 --> 01:51:58.050
<v Speaker 1>I come here to answer questions from the audience.</v>

2895
01:51:58.160 --> 01:52:03.160
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible]</v>

2896
01:52:47.820 --> 01:52:48.653
<v Speaker 5>is he</v>

2897
01:52:50.530 --> 01:52:51.363
<v Speaker 5>your</v>

2898
01:52:56.650 --> 01:52:58.980
<v Speaker 5>cat litter?</v>

2899
01:53:00.460 --> 01:53:03.020
<v Speaker 5>Reforming cycling is</v>

2900
01:53:04.940 --> 01:53:05.571
<v Speaker 5>gentleman Jack,</v>

2901
01:53:05.571 --> 01:53:06.404
<v Speaker 5>when you were</v>

2902
01:53:08.170 --> 01:53:13.170
<v Speaker 5>asking me like mine in how people get back on the world.</v>

2903
01:53:13.550 --> 01:53:14.383
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2904
01:53:15.010 --> 01:53:16.250
<v Speaker 5>technical last from that,</v>

2905
01:53:16.310 --> 01:53:17.143
<v Speaker 5>which is,</v>

2906
01:53:17.720 --> 01:53:21.530
<v Speaker 5>you know I learned this from reading 30 years ago.</v>

2907
01:53:21.800 --> 01:53:25.390
<v Speaker 5>You wrote this essay called placed between the ego and the unconscious through</v>

2908
01:53:25.440 --> 01:53:26.360
<v Speaker 5>work of genius.</v>

2909
01:53:26.800 --> 01:53:30.900
<v Speaker 5>And hit warns people who deal with are like,</v>

2910
01:53:33.330 --> 01:53:34.340
<v Speaker 5>what are the things you</v>

2911
01:53:36.980 --> 01:53:40.200
<v Speaker 5>don't confuse the ideas with cell.</v>

2912
01:53:41.490 --> 01:53:41.930
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2913
01:53:41.930 --> 01:53:43.710
<v Speaker 5>like I hated watermelon.</v>

2914
01:53:45.320 --> 01:53:48.370
<v Speaker 5>A lot of it are some of the biological,</v>

2915
01:53:48.440 --> 01:53:52.790
<v Speaker 5>some of them that you have to be very careful not to cheap credit.</v>

2916
01:53:53.700 --> 01:53:54.270
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2917
01:53:54.270 --> 01:53:54.420
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

2918
01:53:54.420 --> 01:53:56.670
<v Speaker 5>fortunately I've been able to step up.</v>

2919
01:53:56.690 --> 01:54:00.260
<v Speaker 5>These things might be articulated at least what I think could be,</v>

2920
01:54:00.380 --> 01:54:05.210
<v Speaker 5>but the ideas and the stories vastly predate me.</v>

2921
01:54:05.240 --> 01:54:06.740
<v Speaker 5>They're going to be here a lot longer,</v>

2922
01:54:07.700 --> 01:54:12.700
<v Speaker 5>so it's nice to be able to participate in and then to maybe help shed some light</v>

2923
01:54:13.671 --> 01:54:14.610
<v Speaker 5>on them I suppose.</v>

2924
01:54:14.750 --> 01:54:19.300
<v Speaker 5>But I'm very careful to distinguish that from meat.</v>

2925
01:54:19.730 --> 01:54:20.320
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2926
01:54:20.320 --> 01:54:21.210
<v Speaker 5>and you need to do that.</v>

2927
01:54:21.280 --> 01:54:23.100
<v Speaker 5>And you say,</v>

2928
01:54:23.130 --> 01:54:24.800
<v Speaker 5>I say board of inflation,</v>

2929
01:54:25.100 --> 01:54:29.870
<v Speaker 5>which would be a kind of narcissistic ready to be awesome I suppose.</v>

2930
01:54:29.871 --> 01:54:32.120
<v Speaker 5>And it's a very dangerous,</v>

2931
01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:36.920
<v Speaker 5>that's a very dangerous risk when you're investigating these sorts of things.</v>

2932
01:54:36.921 --> 01:54:40.490
<v Speaker 5>But if you're a property terrified about the negative consequences,</v>

2933
01:54:42.370 --> 01:54:43.670
<v Speaker 5>worst excesses,</v>

2934
01:54:44.020 --> 01:54:44.853
<v Speaker 5>Michael.</v>

2935
01:54:54.290 --> 01:54:58.610
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2936
01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:01.153
<v Speaker 5>I</v>

2937
01:55:08.030 --> 01:55:08.440
<v Speaker 5>leave.</v>

2938
01:55:08.440 --> 01:55:11.980
<v Speaker 5>It's sort of sort of university drew in an ethical sense.</v>

2939
01:55:12.890 --> 01:55:13.550
<v Speaker 5>You know he's there.</v>

2940
01:55:13.550 --> 01:55:17.060
<v Speaker 5>That's actually can't tell you exactly why</v>

2941
01:55:21.940 --> 01:55:25.360
<v Speaker 5>I was trying to day life.</v>

2942
01:55:25.430 --> 01:55:27.440
<v Speaker 5>Isn't he adorable?</v>

2943
01:55:27.450 --> 01:55:28.283
<v Speaker 5>Burdensome?</v>

2944
01:55:29.720 --> 01:55:29.871
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2945
01:55:29.871 --> 01:55:32.110
<v Speaker 5>because it's beyond those trained killed us.</v>

2946
01:55:32.640 --> 01:55:33.770
<v Speaker 5>It's beyond us.</v>

2947
01:55:33.830 --> 01:55:34.161
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2948
01:55:34.161 --> 01:55:35.400
<v Speaker 5>well what do you do?</v>

2949
01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:37.470
<v Speaker 5>The base of the new Boston problems,</v>

2950
01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:42.760
<v Speaker 5>often impossible solution and they lost the solution leads to voluntary bear.</v>

2951
01:55:43.450 --> 01:55:44.283
<v Speaker 5>That</v>

2952
01:55:46.140 --> 01:55:46.470
<v Speaker 5>group.</v>

2953
01:55:46.470 --> 01:55:51.470
<v Speaker 5>One of the strange thing is I think we can do that and so I would say at minimum</v>

2954
01:55:52.260 --> 01:55:53.730
<v Speaker 5>psychologically speaking,</v>

2955
01:55:53.731 --> 01:55:55.830
<v Speaker 5>Christ isn't exempt flaw that.</v>

2956
01:55:56.370 --> 01:55:56.581
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2957
01:55:56.581 --> 01:55:58.170
<v Speaker 5>And so something to aim at.</v>

2958
01:55:58.320 --> 01:55:59.153
<v Speaker 5>Of course that's it.</v>

2959
01:55:59.190 --> 01:55:59.590
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>

2960
01:55:59.590 --> 01:56:03.960
<v Speaker 5>What see the thing about these ideas too is you can easily dismiss them because</v>

2961
01:56:04.290 --> 01:56:09.000
<v Speaker 5>it is the case that our culture has a Judaeo Christian pollination and that</v>

2962
01:56:09.001 --> 01:56:09.870
<v Speaker 5>means something.</v>

2963
01:56:09.871 --> 01:56:10.650
<v Speaker 5>It means,</v>

2964
01:56:10.650 --> 01:56:14.730
<v Speaker 5>it means we all these truths to be self evident and that's what it means.</v>

2965
01:56:14.730 --> 01:56:19.160
<v Speaker 5>It's the self evidence in that statement and the self evidence has something to</v>

2966
01:56:19.170 --> 01:56:23.100
<v Speaker 5>do with the fact that you know in your country and my country,</v>

2967
01:56:23.250 --> 01:56:28.250
<v Speaker 5>the individuals to be of this of intrinsic value not given by the state and</v>

2968
01:56:28.750 --> 01:56:33.750
<v Speaker 5>weighed about intrinsic value and worthwhile and I ended up up,</v>

2969
01:56:34.980 --> 01:56:35.240
<v Speaker 5>up,</v>

2970
01:56:35.240 --> 01:56:36.073
<v Speaker 5>up,</v>

2971
01:56:36.180 --> 01:56:40.500
<v Speaker 5>up a fundamental responsibility cause the weight of the state calls on your</v>

2972
01:56:40.501 --> 01:56:41.334
<v Speaker 5>shoulders.</v>

2973
01:56:42.740 --> 01:56:44.060
<v Speaker 5>Just have terminology.</v>

2974
01:56:44.520 --> 01:56:49.350
<v Speaker 5>Our culture is founded on seems to be doing pretty well.</v>

2975
01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:52.880
<v Speaker 5>So that's something we can just dispense the thought.</v>

2976
01:56:54.720 --> 01:56:56.250
<v Speaker 5>There's something to it.</v>

2977
01:56:56.460 --> 01:56:57.293
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2978
01:56:58.850 --> 01:56:59.683
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2979
01:57:01.870 --> 01:57:02.790
<v Speaker 5>well for me it's,</v>

2980
01:57:02.791 --> 01:57:04.360
<v Speaker 5>I don't feel that I</v>

2981
01:57:10.020 --> 01:57:12.840
<v Speaker 5>pushed myself up to the limits of what I know.</v>

2982
01:57:13.080 --> 01:57:15.570
<v Speaker 5>And then hopefully I'll be silent after that.</v>

2983
01:57:15.571 --> 01:57:18.670
<v Speaker 5>And if I learned some more so that I actually know,</v>

2984
01:57:18.710 --> 01:57:20.640
<v Speaker 5>well maybe I can talk about it,</v>

2985
01:57:20.641 --> 01:57:22.270
<v Speaker 5>but until that time try it out,</v>

2986
01:57:26.340 --> 01:57:27.560
<v Speaker 5>we would actually,</v>

2987
01:57:29.850 --> 01:57:30.250
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2988
01:57:30.250 --> 01:57:31.290
<v Speaker 5>not the answer.</v>

2989
01:57:31.380 --> 01:57:34.410
<v Speaker 5>I think what I've found with these stores decrease,</v>

2990
01:57:35.370 --> 01:57:36.120
<v Speaker 5>they go,</v>

2991
01:57:36.120 --> 01:57:37.270
<v Speaker 5>there's no wall.</v>

2992
01:57:38.140 --> 01:57:40.040
<v Speaker 5>God knows how complicated picks,</v>

2993
01:57:40.050 --> 01:57:40.883
<v Speaker 5>really odd.</v>

2994
01:57:41.400 --> 01:57:41.670
<v Speaker 5>Tear,</v>

2995
01:57:41.670 --> 01:57:42.503
<v Speaker 5>complicated,</v>

2996
01:57:44.930 --> 01:57:45.763
<v Speaker 5>satisfied,</v>

2997
01:57:46.350 --> 01:57:47.183
<v Speaker 5>satisfaction.</v>

2998
01:57:49.230 --> 01:57:51.690
<v Speaker 5>The satisfaction question,</v>

2999
01:57:52.650 --> 01:57:52.940
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

3000
01:57:52.940 --> 01:57:54.540
<v Speaker 5>And I think that's the right answer.</v>

3001
01:57:54.541 --> 01:57:56.190
<v Speaker 5>Just satisfaction questions.</v>

3002
01:57:56.210 --> 01:57:57.110
<v Speaker 5>It's the right gas,</v>

3003
01:57:57.300 --> 01:57:57.610
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3004
01:57:57.610 --> 01:57:58.443
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>

3005
01:57:58.830 --> 01:58:01.230
<v Speaker 5>So he'll want to run out of things to do anyways.</v>

3006
01:58:01.290 --> 01:58:02.123
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

3007
01:58:07.140 --> 01:58:08.240
<v Speaker 6>very rare</v>

3008
01:58:14.740 --> 01:58:15.573
<v Speaker 6>art.</v>

3009
01:58:31.740 --> 01:58:32.573
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3010
01:58:40.990 --> 01:58:41.823
<v Speaker 5>Well you never know.</v>

3011
01:58:57.820 --> 01:58:59.710
<v Speaker 5>Whatever possibilities.</v>

3012
01:59:01.740 --> 01:59:06.700
<v Speaker 5>It's certainly be gratifying to go around from city to city doing these talks.</v>

3013
01:59:09.010 --> 01:59:09.610
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>

3014
01:59:09.610 --> 01:59:09.831
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3015
01:59:09.831 --> 01:59:11.110
<v Speaker 5>but that's a lovely thing.</v>

3016
01:59:11.190 --> 01:59:12.023
<v Speaker 5>One of the,</v>

3017
01:59:12.130 --> 01:59:14.510
<v Speaker 5>somebody asked him about coffee.</v>

3018
01:59:14.511 --> 01:59:15.344
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3019
01:59:17.300 --> 01:59:17.600
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3020
01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:20.900
<v Speaker 5>but I can tell you what I experience and</v>

3021
01:59:23.590 --> 01:59:24.940
<v Speaker 5>wherever I go now</v>

3022
01:59:26.460 --> 01:59:27.293
<v Speaker 5>I need</v>

3023
01:59:33.850 --> 01:59:38.850
<v Speaker 5>a touching story telling them just want extra or something like that.</v>

3024
01:59:39.720 --> 01:59:43.960
<v Speaker 5>We say they tell me something about that state your life.</v>

3025
01:59:43.961 --> 01:59:45.430
<v Speaker 5>Was He in a disordered state?</v>

3026
01:59:45.440 --> 01:59:46.600
<v Speaker 5>In one form or another?</v>

3027
01:59:46.830 --> 01:59:48.910
<v Speaker 5>Have sometimes severely disordered.</v>

3028
01:59:49.030 --> 01:59:49.331
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

3029
01:59:49.331 --> 01:59:54.331
<v Speaker 5>I can't tell me the other day it was so cold and the more I talk for 10 seconds,</v>

3030
01:59:54.580 --> 01:59:57.460
<v Speaker 5>he said year and a half ago I just got out of jail.</v>

3031
01:59:58.720 --> 01:59:59.920
<v Speaker 5>Now I'm married,</v>

3032
01:59:59.921 --> 02:00:00.760
<v Speaker 5>I have a child.</v>

3033
02:00:00.761 --> 02:00:05.500
<v Speaker 5>I just bought my own apartment because he was watching my lectures,</v>

3034
02:00:07.730 --> 02:00:12.730
<v Speaker 5>you know and so well so the reason I broke that up cause you were talking about</v>

3035
02:00:13.180 --> 02:00:14.013
<v Speaker 5>law,</v>

3036
02:00:15.360 --> 02:00:17.540
<v Speaker 5>what's extraordinary gratified.</v>

3037
02:00:17.541 --> 02:00:17.950
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>

3038
02:00:17.950 --> 02:00:18.580
<v Speaker 5>This is,</v>

3039
02:00:18.580 --> 02:00:20.020
<v Speaker 5>there's plenty of that to me.</v>

3040
02:00:20.560 --> 02:00:24.730
<v Speaker 5>So it seems like it's going quite well and see how you can help out with that</v>

3041
02:00:24.820 --> 02:00:25.570
<v Speaker 5>continued,</v>

3042
02:00:25.570 --> 02:00:26.740
<v Speaker 5>you know my,</v>

3043
02:00:27.160 --> 02:00:31.550
<v Speaker 5>my set more sensible park is expected.</v>

3044
02:00:33.310 --> 02:00:37.270
<v Speaker 5>Just seem too crazy to be sustainable.</v>

3045
02:00:37.300 --> 02:00:38.133
<v Speaker 5>But</v>

3046
02:00:50.900 --> 02:00:51.733
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

3047
02:01:09.070 --> 02:01:10.900
<v Speaker 5>six year old,</v>

3048
02:01:23.520 --> 02:01:25.620
<v Speaker 5>I would say you need to talk to your partner,</v>

3049
02:01:26.100 --> 02:01:27.690
<v Speaker 5>your disciplinary scrap,</v>

3050
02:01:28.680 --> 02:01:31.860
<v Speaker 5>decide where do you live in is.</v>

3051
02:01:32.190 --> 02:01:34.010
<v Speaker 5>And be honest about that.</v>

3052
02:01:34.150 --> 02:01:38.860
<v Speaker 5>It's costly from what you've told my suspicions,</v>

3053
02:01:39.500 --> 02:01:40.333
<v Speaker 5>allowing yourself,</v>

3054
02:01:42.900 --> 02:01:43.850
<v Speaker 3>MMM</v>

3055
02:01:44.960 --> 02:01:49.250
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] wishes.</v>

3056
02:01:49.270 --> 02:01:50.180
<v Speaker 5>You've asked me at this.</v>

3057
02:01:50.680 --> 02:01:53.050
<v Speaker 5>Stop it.</v>

3058
02:01:53.051 --> 02:01:53.884
<v Speaker 5>See what happens.</v>

3059
02:01:54.070 --> 02:01:58.980
<v Speaker 5>My suspicions are liking [inaudible] attitude.</v>

3060
02:01:59.830 --> 02:02:02.090
<v Speaker 5>You have to have a discussion about that,</v>

3061
02:02:08.800 --> 02:02:10.440
<v Speaker 5>but you're</v>

3062
02:02:13.540 --> 02:02:16.870
<v Speaker 5>getting it in front of me and good for giving.</v>

3063
02:02:16.871 --> 02:02:21.490
<v Speaker 5>You finally sat and he's a Bush character.</v>

3064
02:02:21.960 --> 02:02:23.040
<v Speaker 5>What that means in part,</v>

3065
02:02:23.090 --> 02:02:27.560
<v Speaker 5>he really well socializing because a kid like that wants to go where the lines</v>

3066
02:02:27.920 --> 02:02:30.040
<v Speaker 5>like it isn't just tossed.</v>

3067
02:02:31.570 --> 02:02:33.000
<v Speaker 5>The light can be this thick,</v>

3068
02:02:33.040 --> 02:02:33.873
<v Speaker 5>vague,</v>

3069
02:02:34.080 --> 02:02:35.370
<v Speaker 5>her kid like that.</v>

3070
02:02:35.450 --> 02:02:35.880
<v Speaker 5>Oh No,</v>

3071
02:02:35.880 --> 02:02:36.713
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

3072
02:02:37.320 --> 02:02:41.910
<v Speaker 5>He wants to know where the lions and the advantage to that.</v>

3073
02:02:41.920 --> 02:02:44.020
<v Speaker 5>If you can show exactly where the line is.</v>

3074
02:02:44.100 --> 02:02:45.010
<v Speaker 5>Perverse behavior,</v>

3075
02:02:45.030 --> 02:02:47.500
<v Speaker 5>keeping him on unbelievably sophisticated social.</v>

3076
02:02:47.930 --> 02:02:51.170
<v Speaker 5>So that's the advantage in that kind of emotion is what I would say.</v>

3077
02:02:51.830 --> 02:02:53.470
<v Speaker 5>It also sounds like he's tough enough</v>

3078
02:02:55.810 --> 02:02:56.643
<v Speaker 5>sphere.</v>

3079
02:02:56.930 --> 02:02:58.760
<v Speaker 5>My suspicions are the liking better.</v>

3080
02:02:58.820 --> 02:02:59.631
<v Speaker 5>My son was like,</v>

3081
02:02:59.631 --> 02:03:01.360
<v Speaker 5>that is a tough path.</v>

3082
02:03:01.361 --> 02:03:02.880
<v Speaker 5>Is that right from the right?</v>

3083
02:03:04.010 --> 02:03:06.380
<v Speaker 5>And one of the things that I experienced was that,</v>

3084
02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:07.301
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3085
02:03:07.301 --> 02:03:12.301
<v Speaker 5>to him and humiliate me and my wife is Kevin Thompson candies mushed 11,</v>

3086
02:03:13.991 --> 02:03:14.790
<v Speaker 5>10,</v>

3087
02:03:14.790 --> 02:03:15.623
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

3088
02:03:16.340 --> 02:03:17.930
<v Speaker 5>For the next three days.</v>

3089
02:03:17.931 --> 02:03:20.910
<v Speaker 5>He gets a movement every time.</v>

3090
02:03:21.530 --> 02:03:25.230
<v Speaker 5>It really shocked because I wasn't sure if that would happen,</v>

3091
02:03:25.710 --> 02:03:26.810
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

3092
02:03:26.811 --> 02:03:28.070
<v Speaker 5>he's looking for</v>

3093
02:03:30.220 --> 02:03:32.280
<v Speaker 3>solo or</v>

3094
02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:33.313
<v Speaker 5>maybe</v>

3095
02:03:36.680 --> 02:03:39.350
<v Speaker 5>he won't buy being reasonable.</v>

3096
02:03:39.400 --> 02:03:43.160
<v Speaker 5>You just in the very strategies version will be the real harm even though there</v>

3097
02:03:43.161 --> 02:03:44.680
<v Speaker 5>might be a lot of sparks and the like,</v>

3098
02:03:45.680 --> 02:03:49.330
<v Speaker 5>that's also part of the testing so that</v>

3099
02:03:51.530 --> 02:03:52.363
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3100
02:03:54.730 --> 02:03:55.790
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3101
02:03:57.760 --> 02:03:58.593

3102
02:04:03.850 --> 02:04:04.840
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3103
02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:19.000
<v Speaker 5>you feel me like so many and dealt with things around you do all</v>

3104
02:04:22.220 --> 02:04:23.220
<v Speaker 5>the mask.</v>

3105
02:04:23.510 --> 02:04:24.650
<v Speaker 5>Most people aren't.</v>

3106
02:04:24.651 --> 02:04:29.651
<v Speaker 5>In that situation I have had was tangled up Sophie,</v>

3107
02:04:31.590 --> 02:04:36.590
<v Speaker 5>he fixed my thinking and we fixed one of them.</v>

3108
02:04:48.110 --> 02:04:48.943
<v Speaker 5>You</v>

3109
02:04:52.370 --> 02:04:53.203
<v Speaker 5>wait</v>

3112
02:04:58.170 --> 02:04:58.430
<v Speaker 5>good.</v>

3113
02:04:58.430 --> 02:05:03.430
<v Speaker 5>It does know there's Christian Christianity that</v>

3114
02:05:10.270 --> 02:05:12.920
<v Speaker 5>might have a big</v>

3115
02:05:17.900 --> 02:05:18.950
<v Speaker 5>lot of that</v>

3116
02:05:21.720 --> 02:05:22.440
<v Speaker 5>are,</v>

3117
02:05:22.440 --> 02:05:23.540
<v Speaker 5>that doesn't mean it's awesome.</v>

3118
02:05:24.580 --> 02:05:26.030
<v Speaker 5>So I've seen people</v>

3119
02:05:28.060 --> 02:05:30.940
<v Speaker 5>take [inaudible] in your life,</v>

3120
02:05:32.550 --> 02:05:33.383
<v Speaker 5>that's for sure.</v>

3121
02:05:34.120 --> 02:05:34.953
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3122
02:05:38.860 --> 02:05:39.680
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>

3123
02:05:39.680 --> 02:05:40.513
<v Speaker 6>Rolling.</v>

3124
02:05:49.200 --> 02:05:50.033
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3125
02:06:05.430 --> 02:06:06.300
<v Speaker 5>it's good.</v>

3126
02:06:06.560 --> 02:06:07.393
<v Speaker 5>The restaurant</v>

3127
02:06:15.300 --> 02:06:20.150
<v Speaker 5>you might want to just speed through because it was an issue I tried to workout</v>

3128
02:06:20.230 --> 02:06:21.063
<v Speaker 5>in them,</v>

3129
02:06:21.720 --> 02:06:23.590
<v Speaker 5>which is the relationship between disciplines.</v>

3130
02:06:24.660 --> 02:06:25.370
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3131
02:06:25.370 --> 02:06:26.430
<v Speaker 5>you can think of Moses,</v>

3132
02:06:26.490 --> 02:06:28.440
<v Speaker 5>oh say well if you take one,</v>

3133
02:06:28.441 --> 02:06:31.570
<v Speaker 5>half of those other paths are those other paths</v>

3134
02:06:33.720 --> 02:06:37.100
<v Speaker 5>and your potential has the mat step your pants story.</v>

3135
02:06:37.960 --> 02:06:42.960
<v Speaker 5>Peter Pan Wants to stay a kid because Penn needs every essentially it's so he</v>

3136
02:06:43.111 --> 02:06:46.170
<v Speaker 5>wants to retain the infinite possibility of child</v>

3137
02:06:47.750 --> 02:06:49.980
<v Speaker 5>but then he ends up king in the lost boys.</v>

3138
02:06:50.500 --> 02:06:51.440
<v Speaker 5>Like he never,</v>

3139
02:06:51.441 --> 02:06:53.630
<v Speaker 5>lamb will never like this exist.</v>

3140
02:06:53.720 --> 02:06:58.720
<v Speaker 5>And who wants to be king was is anyways cause he sees Kevin Hart capital is a</v>

3141
02:06:59.971 --> 02:07:00.804
<v Speaker 5>tire.</v>

3142
02:07:01.370 --> 02:07:01.641
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3143
02:07:01.641 --> 02:07:03.710
<v Speaker 5>And the reason is the tire just cause he's terrified.</v>

3144
02:07:03.770 --> 02:07:04.603
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3145
02:07:04.640 --> 02:07:05.473
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3146
02:07:06.160 --> 02:07:09.750
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] it's already got a piece.</v>

3147
02:07:10.520 --> 02:07:13.490
<v Speaker 5>So how gets a target is terrified of care,</v>

3148
02:07:13.580 --> 02:07:18.580
<v Speaker 5>lead a panel properly with the CS and the dollar this year or is keen in lost</v>

3149
02:07:18.890 --> 02:07:20.540
<v Speaker 5>boys and he doesn't get when the either,</v>

3150
02:07:20.960 --> 02:07:21.680
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

3151
02:07:21.680 --> 02:07:22.040
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

3152
02:07:22.040 --> 02:07:23.640
<v Speaker 5>So I'm sure that</v>

3153
02:07:25.220 --> 02:07:26.930
<v Speaker 5>it's okay to make a decision.</v>

3154
02:07:27.430 --> 02:07:27.930
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3155
02:07:27.930 --> 02:07:29.750
<v Speaker 5>you limit yourself.</v>

3156
02:07:29.751 --> 02:07:32.190
<v Speaker 5>But in that limiting also spam yourself.</v>

3157
02:07:32.470 --> 02:07:34.280
<v Speaker 5>Like if you,</v>

3158
02:07:34.550 --> 02:07:35.350
<v Speaker 5>this is what,</v>

3159
02:07:35.350 --> 02:07:40.350
<v Speaker 5>in science you can pick out a new problem called the school</v>

3160
02:07:46.110 --> 02:07:47.370
<v Speaker 5>and when you start to work on that,</v>

3161
02:07:48.050 --> 02:07:48.940
<v Speaker 5>it expands.</v>

3162
02:07:49.030 --> 02:07:50.710
<v Speaker 5>You get disciplined in the Spanish,</v>

3163
02:07:51.040 --> 02:07:55.840
<v Speaker 5>and so you make some constraints and the constraints of relationship,</v>

3164
02:07:55.870 --> 02:07:58.260
<v Speaker 5>they become stranger career and you accept it.</v>

3165
02:07:58.270 --> 02:07:59.500
<v Speaker 5>It was a discipline yourself.</v>

3166
02:07:59.501 --> 02:08:04.180
<v Speaker 5>And the consequences of that is that that expanse of passing the modeling.</v>

3167
02:08:04.840 --> 02:08:05.673
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

3168
02:08:07.020 --> 02:08:08.710
<v Speaker 5>potential as a child discipline,</v>

3169
02:08:08.711 --> 02:08:10.960
<v Speaker 5>that it's a real system of constraints,</v>

3170
02:08:10.961 --> 02:08:13.880
<v Speaker 5>a sacrifice 12 to sacrifice all those other potential</v>

3171
02:08:15.400 --> 02:08:16.041
<v Speaker 5>pay off.</v>

3172
02:08:16.041 --> 02:08:17.170
<v Speaker 5>As you discipline yourself,</v>

3173
02:08:17.230 --> 02:08:18.370
<v Speaker 5>you start to expand out.</v>

3174
02:08:18.850 --> 02:08:19.683
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

3175
02:08:21.850 --> 02:08:22.990
<v Speaker 5>the way that I deal with that,</v>

3176
02:08:22.991 --> 02:08:27.991
<v Speaker 5>usually my clinical practices implemented the best plan you have to,</v>

3177
02:08:28.810 --> 02:08:28.940
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3178
02:08:28.940 --> 02:08:30.580
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to wait around for a better class.</v>

3179
02:08:30.700 --> 02:08:34.240
<v Speaker 5>That's not a good plan because you're not informing yourself while you're</v>

3180
02:08:34.241 --> 02:08:35.074
<v Speaker 5>waiting around.</v>

3181
02:08:35.270 --> 02:08:36.690
<v Speaker 5>So if you implement a plan,</v>

3182
02:08:36.700 --> 02:08:37.690
<v Speaker 5>it's not a perfect plan.</v>

3183
02:08:37.691 --> 02:08:41.070
<v Speaker 5>At least you'd know why it's a role specific.</v>

3184
02:08:42.040 --> 02:08:42.641
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

3185
02:08:42.641 --> 02:08:43.474
<v Speaker 5>What's wrong?</v>

3186
02:08:44.110 --> 02:08:45.090
<v Speaker 5>Damn lab.</v>

3187
02:08:45.370 --> 02:08:45.731
<v Speaker 5>Sorry.</v>

3188
02:08:45.731 --> 02:08:46.564
<v Speaker 5>We'll see.</v>

3189
02:08:47.320 --> 02:08:49.800
<v Speaker 5>You lose a lot less by sacrificing that.</v>

3190
02:08:49.810 --> 02:08:50.880
<v Speaker 5>You think that the game,</v>

3191
02:08:51.850 --> 02:08:55.300
<v Speaker 5>so that's what it looks like to me moving forward.</v>

3192
02:08:55.301 --> 02:08:55.810
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>

3193
02:08:55.810 --> 02:08:56.381
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

3194
02:08:56.381 --> 02:08:56.860
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3195
02:08:56.860 --> 02:08:58.030
<v Speaker 5>life's short room.</v>

3196
02:08:58.031 --> 02:08:58.600
<v Speaker 5>Horrible.</v>

3197
02:08:58.600 --> 02:08:59.730
<v Speaker 5>That's the call of adventure.</v>

3198
02:08:59.731 --> 02:09:01.810
<v Speaker 5>And even having stories like you know,</v>

3199
02:09:01.820 --> 02:09:05.530
<v Speaker 5>constantly would those God calling them to and they do it,</v>

3200
02:09:07.350 --> 02:09:07.870
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

3201
02:09:07.870 --> 02:09:10.180
<v Speaker 5>But it's better than standing where you are.</v>

3202
02:09:10.300 --> 02:09:11.133
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3203
02:09:22.170 --> 02:09:23.700
<v Speaker 5>You rag magnate</v>

3204
02:09:26.390 --> 02:09:27.223
<v Speaker 5>and</v>

3205
02:09:34.780 --> 02:09:36.520
<v Speaker 5>bitter bitterness.</v>

3206
02:09:37.960 --> 02:09:38.793
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3207
02:09:39.100 --> 02:09:41.110
<v Speaker 5>just just one of the ways that you could tell,</v>

3208
02:09:41.770 --> 02:09:42.790
<v Speaker 5>you can tell,</v>

3209
02:09:43.480 --> 02:09:45.160
<v Speaker 5>one of the things that council people do,</v>

3210
02:09:45.161 --> 02:09:48.860
<v Speaker 5>and I talked about this like is consult you resent,</v>

3211
02:09:49.380 --> 02:09:49.560
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

3212
02:09:49.560 --> 02:09:52.310
<v Speaker 5>let's say that he knows where your resentment like,</v>

3213
02:09:52.510 --> 02:09:53.343
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

3214
02:09:54.510 --> 02:09:55.820
<v Speaker 5>why are you present?</v>

3215
02:09:56.720 --> 02:09:57.850
<v Speaker 5>There's only two reasons.</v>

3216
02:09:57.910 --> 02:10:02.910
<v Speaker 5>One is you're used to sit and wine and you should grow the hell up and accept</v>

3217
02:10:03.451 --> 02:10:05.920
<v Speaker 5>the responsibility hospital possible.</v>

3218
02:10:05.980 --> 02:10:10.980
<v Speaker 5>One possibility number two is you're taking too much onto yourself without</v>

3219
02:10:12.311 --> 02:10:15.250
<v Speaker 5>sufficient recommends who reward.</v>

3220
02:10:15.370 --> 02:10:17.290
<v Speaker 5>So you're taking advantage of yourself,</v>

3221
02:10:17.291 --> 02:10:18.410
<v Speaker 5>where you're allowing yourself.</v>

3222
02:10:19.500 --> 02:10:21.090
<v Speaker 5>It's one of those too.</v>

3223
02:10:21.280 --> 02:10:21.700
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

3224
02:10:21.700 --> 02:10:21.971
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

3225
02:10:21.971 --> 02:10:25.390
<v Speaker 5>so how do you figure out which one it is all suspect the first one,</v>

3226
02:10:26.200 --> 02:10:26.501
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3227
02:10:26.501 --> 02:10:30.880
<v Speaker 5>Because you should always be a little suspicious in relationship to yourself as</v>

3228
02:10:30.881 --> 02:10:31.920
<v Speaker 5>a little helpful that way.</v>

3229
02:10:31.990 --> 02:10:34.240
<v Speaker 5>And I don't mean accessing to be skeptical,</v>

3230
02:10:36.740 --> 02:10:37.573
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3231
02:10:37.860 --> 02:10:38.210
<v Speaker 5>trust.</v>

3232
02:10:38.210 --> 02:10:38.691
<v Speaker 5>They might say,</v>

3233
02:10:38.691 --> 02:10:42.590
<v Speaker 5>no one knows I need all your taken way too much then.</v>

3234
02:10:43.250 --> 02:10:48.250
<v Speaker 5>Then you have to figure out how you reward yourself for that shit.</v>

3235
02:10:48.401 --> 02:10:51.200
<v Speaker 5>Some of it so that you have,</v>

3236
02:10:53.330 --> 02:10:55.760
<v Speaker 5>because you have to be just to yourself.</v>

3237
02:10:56.330 --> 02:10:56.511
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3238
02:10:56.511 --> 02:10:56.901
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

3239
02:10:56.901 --> 02:10:59.270
<v Speaker 5>when did you take on as much responsibility as you can?</v>

3240
02:10:59.630 --> 02:11:02.850
<v Speaker 5>But that also means as much as pat,</v>

3241
02:11:03.200 --> 02:11:04.670
<v Speaker 5>if you're starting to get presented with,</v>

3242
02:11:04.700 --> 02:11:07.580
<v Speaker 5>that's often an assignment you've taken on too much,</v>

3243
02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:09.590
<v Speaker 5>grinding yourself into the ground.</v>

3244
02:11:10.030 --> 02:11:12.830
<v Speaker 5>It's a bad strategy from a sustainability perspective.</v>

3245
02:11:12.831 --> 02:11:15.800
<v Speaker 5>So it's all your present and see,</v>

3246
02:11:16.070 --> 02:11:17.720
<v Speaker 5>because you want to be able to iterate.</v>

3247
02:11:17.721 --> 02:11:20.940
<v Speaker 5>If you want to be able to maintain the burden across time and resentment,</v>

3248
02:11:20.950 --> 02:11:23.220
<v Speaker 5>the assignment or that you've taken on such a level,</v>

3249
02:11:23.250 --> 02:11:24.083
<v Speaker 5>you can't do that.</v>

3250
02:11:25.530 --> 02:11:28.390
<v Speaker 5>That's a partial answer to that.</v>

3251
02:11:51.480 --> 02:11:53.850
<v Speaker 4>So what you're saying,</v>

3252
02:11:56.970 --> 02:11:57.803
<v Speaker 5>monogamy,</v>

3253
02:12:00.510 --> 02:12:02.060
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3254
02:12:02.200 --> 02:12:03.070
<v Speaker 5>if you're gonna,</v>

3255
02:12:03.140 --> 02:12:05.500
<v Speaker 5>if you're going to accuse someone of something,</v>

3256
02:12:05.530 --> 02:12:06.730
<v Speaker 5>you shouldn't use the book.</v>

3257
02:12:06.731 --> 02:12:08.890
<v Speaker 5>Something that someone was somewhere,</v>

3258
02:12:08.891 --> 02:12:10.340
<v Speaker 5>I bet if we believe</v>

3259
02:12:12.390 --> 02:12:15.190
<v Speaker 5>that the state should intervene and distributed</v>

3260
02:12:15.860 --> 02:12:20.860
<v Speaker 4>well [inaudible] recruiters,</v>

3261
02:12:33.380 --> 02:12:34.213
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

3262
02:12:37.020 --> 02:12:37.853
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3263
02:12:46.550 --> 02:12:48.230
<v Speaker 5>All sorts of immediately.</v>

3264
02:12:48.290 --> 02:12:49.670
<v Speaker 5>Cause I do a lot of media here.</v>

3265
02:12:49.760 --> 02:12:50.970
<v Speaker 5>But no,</v>

3266
02:12:50.971 --> 02:12:53.030
<v Speaker 5>I've never heard from Chenin four again.</v>

3267
02:12:53.180 --> 02:12:55.300
<v Speaker 5>But I didn't reach out to her after that.</v>

3268
02:12:55.940 --> 02:12:58.550
<v Speaker 5>After the first week.</v>

3269
02:12:59.010 --> 02:13:01.000
<v Speaker 5>Right through it.</v>

3270
02:13:01.050 --> 02:13:02.100
<v Speaker 5>It's a media look,</v>

3271
02:13:02.300 --> 02:13:04.030
<v Speaker 5>why don't we actually do this gifts.</v>

3272
02:13:04.031 --> 02:13:05.630
<v Speaker 5>It could actually have a conversation.</v>

3273
02:13:05.810 --> 02:13:06.710
<v Speaker 5>And she said,</v>

3274
02:13:07.370 --> 02:13:11.730
<v Speaker 5>well I'll think I'll wait until it dies down to this trouble those down</v>

3275
02:13:13.640 --> 02:13:17.420
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] it was a funny situation.</v>

3276
02:13:18.660 --> 02:13:19.300
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3277
02:13:19.300 --> 02:13:20.133
<v Speaker 5>I</v>

3278
02:13:21.210 --> 02:13:23.500
<v Speaker 5>haven't lost the big chop it up.</v>

3279
02:13:24.030 --> 02:13:24.863
<v Speaker 5>Five minutes.</v>

3280
02:13:25.340 --> 02:13:27.130
<v Speaker 5>Three Boston could like NBC,</v>

3281
02:13:27.580 --> 02:13:28.390
<v Speaker 5>NBC,</v>

3282
02:13:28.390 --> 02:13:29.040
<v Speaker 5>worst job,</v>

3283
02:13:29.040 --> 02:13:29.830
<v Speaker 5>anyone.</v>

3284
02:13:29.830 --> 02:13:30.990
<v Speaker 5>That was my calling.</v>

3285
02:13:31.350 --> 02:13:32.183
<v Speaker 5>It was so,</v>

3286
02:13:32.430 --> 02:13:34.200
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't even so much that it was,</v>

3287
02:13:35.700 --> 02:13:36.533
<v Speaker 2>although</v>

3288
02:13:38.040 --> 02:13:40.300
<v Speaker 2>it was so amateurish.</v>

3289
02:13:41.120 --> 02:13:41.980
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3290
02:13:41.990 --> 02:13:43.310
<v Speaker 2>It's not malicious,</v>

3291
02:13:43.320 --> 02:13:44.640
<v Speaker 2>but it would be stupid.</v>

3292
02:13:44.700 --> 02:13:48.960
<v Speaker 2>That's a really bad combination because they put up the edit version,</v>

3293
02:13:49.570 --> 02:13:51.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean whatever the action of video.</v>

3294
02:13:51.580 --> 02:13:53.580
<v Speaker 2>And so then people on Youtube just said,</v>

3295
02:13:53.581 --> 02:13:54.414
<v Speaker 2>well</v>

3296
02:13:57.720 --> 02:13:59.250
<v Speaker 2>I expected more from,</v>

3297
02:13:59.340 --> 02:14:00.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3298
02:14:00.070 --> 02:14:00.903
<v Speaker 2>and so.</v>

3299
02:14:01.060 --> 02:14:02.910
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

3300
02:14:02.911 --> 02:14:04.060
<v Speaker 2>I haven't heard back from,</v>

3301
02:14:05.350 --> 02:14:06.600
<v Speaker 2>and I don't really expect.</v>

3302
02:14:07.670 --> 02:14:12.280
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's the city for enforcement order</v>

3303
02:14:17.930 --> 02:14:19.490
<v Speaker 2>this understanding that that annoys me.</v>

3304
02:14:19.510 --> 02:14:20.343
<v Speaker 2>Most days I,</v>

3305
02:14:20.450 --> 02:14:25.060
<v Speaker 2>he's been accused of a baby to what you post modernism,</v>

3306
02:14:25.160 --> 02:14:28.320
<v Speaker 2>new marks that the Sukkot philosophers</v>

3307
02:14:29.860 --> 02:14:33.870
<v Speaker 2>know that postmodernism is skeptical and Ben and narratives admins,</v>

3308
02:14:33.900 --> 02:14:35.760
<v Speaker 2>it's not commensurate Marxism.</v>

3309
02:14:35.761 --> 02:14:36.360
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3310
02:14:36.360 --> 02:14:36.691
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3311
02:14:36.691 --> 02:14:39.810
<v Speaker 2>I know that in that the blood post modernists is having to seek a particular,</v>

3312
02:14:39.980 --> 02:14:40.813
<v Speaker 2>now</v>

3313
02:14:42.490 --> 02:14:43.820
<v Speaker 2>it's like they're,</v>

3314
02:14:43.860 --> 02:14:48.860
<v Speaker 2>they're using the ignorance on a philosophical topic with the actual situation</v>

3315
02:14:49.111 --> 02:14:49.381
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

3316
02:14:49.381 --> 02:14:54.160
<v Speaker 2>is that just might the fact that those doctrines are not commensurate,</v>

3317
02:14:54.230 --> 02:14:55.950
<v Speaker 2>they're juxtaposed constantly.</v>

3318
02:14:56.540 --> 02:14:58.340
<v Speaker 2>That's how my misunderstanding,</v>

3319
02:14:58.460 --> 02:15:01.910
<v Speaker 2>that's the confusion of the people in the aggregate in academia.</v>

3320
02:15:01.980 --> 02:15:03.560
<v Speaker 2>So that's the most annoying.</v>

3321
02:15:03.840 --> 02:15:04.770
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

3322
02:15:04.771 --> 02:15:05.750
<v Speaker 2>and it's not that,</v>

3323
02:15:06.090 --> 02:15:07.010
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

3324
02:15:10.590 --> 02:15:15.590
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] is unbelievably unworn cause he knew nothing about them.</v>

3325
02:15:24.841 --> 02:15:27.090
<v Speaker 2>So it was just cash shooting off his mouth.</v>

3326
02:15:27.420 --> 02:15:27.661
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3327
02:15:27.661 --> 02:15:27.871
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3328
02:15:27.871 --> 02:15:28.704
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

3329
02:15:30.270 --> 02:15:35.270
<v Speaker 2>mean I have plenty of experience with so called minority communities.</v>

3330
02:15:36.001 --> 02:15:40.890
<v Speaker 2>Like I get to use that terminology or minorities or communities,</v>

3331
02:15:40.891 --> 02:15:41.671
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

3332
02:15:41.671 --> 02:15:44.330
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't know a damn thing about what I know about,</v>

3333
02:15:44.540 --> 02:15:48.450
<v Speaker 2>about people who've already now and then just assess the situation.</v>

3334
02:15:48.600 --> 02:15:49.350
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3335
02:15:49.350 --> 02:15:50.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3336
02:15:50.130 --> 02:15:50.790
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

3337
02:15:50.790 --> 02:15:51.810
<v Speaker 2>he was very,</v>

3338
02:15:54.230 --> 02:15:57.150
<v Speaker 2>he had a pretty decent rhetorical kissed.</v>

3339
02:15:58.110 --> 02:16:02.250
<v Speaker 2>He could be charismatic and a good sense of humor,</v>

3340
02:16:02.490 --> 02:16:05.340
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of cheap shots.</v>

3341
02:16:09.540 --> 02:16:12.390
<v Speaker 2>Like when I pushed him on white privilege thing,</v>

3342
02:16:12.420 --> 02:16:12.691
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

3343
02:16:12.691 --> 02:16:13.111
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

3344
02:16:13.111 --> 02:16:13.770
<v Speaker 2>fine ma'am,</v>

3345
02:16:13.770 --> 02:16:16.280
<v Speaker 2>if I net terms all he did was accurate.</v>

3346
02:16:16.290 --> 02:16:16.720
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>

3347
02:16:16.720 --> 02:16:17.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3348
02:16:17.520 --> 02:16:18.353
<v Speaker 2>an assault.</v>

3349
02:16:18.360 --> 02:16:18.541
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3350
02:16:18.541 --> 02:16:19.374
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3351
02:16:19.380 --> 02:16:20.670
<v Speaker 2>it's not an assault.</v>

3352
02:16:20.850 --> 02:16:22.680
<v Speaker 2>We specify your damn returns,</v>

3353
02:16:22.860 --> 02:16:23.221
<v Speaker 2>all that,</v>

3354
02:16:23.221 --> 02:16:24.980
<v Speaker 2>it was a main become irritating.</v>

3355
02:16:25.050 --> 02:16:25.381
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3356
02:16:25.381 --> 02:16:25.591
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3357
02:16:25.591 --> 02:16:26.430
<v Speaker 2>it made me think.</v>

3358
02:16:26.431 --> 02:16:27.340
<v Speaker 2>And now you're irritating.</v>

3359
02:16:34.060 --> 02:16:34.893
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3360
02:16:56.900 --> 02:16:57.733
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3361
02:17:08.560 --> 02:17:09.060
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

3362
02:17:09.060 --> 02:17:13.080
<v Speaker 5>and there's all sorts of schools of philosophy,</v>

3363
02:17:14.620 --> 02:17:17.540
<v Speaker 5>physics as well that our unbelievably,</v>

3364
02:17:17.541 --> 02:17:18.374
<v Speaker 5>he can just,</v>

3365
02:17:20.030 --> 02:17:21.460
<v Speaker 5>it's very,</v>

3366
02:17:21.461 --> 02:17:21.791
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>

3367
02:17:21.791 --> 02:17:22.750
<v Speaker 5>very complicated.</v>

3368
02:17:23.130 --> 02:17:25.970
<v Speaker 5>And it's not a matter of truth.</v>

3369
02:17:29.140 --> 02:17:31.700
<v Speaker 5>Here's the truth is associated with how you act.</v>

3370
02:17:32.240 --> 02:17:32.830
<v Speaker 5>There's a truth.</v>

3371
02:17:32.830 --> 02:17:35.070
<v Speaker 5>It's associated with what the world's is.</v>

3372
02:17:39.490 --> 02:17:40.323
<v Speaker 5>No one knows how</v>

3373
02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:44.850
<v Speaker 5>the cake is.</v>

3374
02:17:45.030 --> 02:17:45.980
<v Speaker 5>Katherine's identified.</v>

3375
02:17:46.980 --> 02:17:47.641
<v Speaker 5>These are very,</v>

3376
02:17:47.641 --> 02:17:49.700
<v Speaker 5>very complicated for all known.</v>

3377
02:17:49.750 --> 02:17:51.110
<v Speaker 5>If they seem self evident,</v>

3378
02:17:51.190 --> 02:17:54.220
<v Speaker 5>the only reason they seem self evident as you the dark one.</v>

3379
02:17:55.880 --> 02:17:57.220
<v Speaker 5>And that's what you know,</v>

3380
02:17:57.250 --> 02:17:58.570
<v Speaker 5>and it seems self evident.</v>

3381
02:17:58.710 --> 02:18:01.070
<v Speaker 5>There's like 30 of them and they fight,</v>

3382
02:18:01.330 --> 02:18:02.470
<v Speaker 5>they fight like half,</v>

3383
02:18:02.930 --> 02:18:03.763
<v Speaker 5>so</v>

3384
02:18:08.880 --> 02:18:09.713
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3385
02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:10.833
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>

3386
02:18:11.930 --> 02:18:12.763
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3387
02:18:15.980 --> 02:18:16.813
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3388
02:18:22.360 --> 02:18:22.931
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3389
02:18:22.931 --> 02:18:23.201
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

3390
02:18:23.201 --> 02:18:23.681
<v Speaker 5>so you know,</v>

3391
02:18:23.681 --> 02:18:26.630
<v Speaker 5>you said when you deconverted that you went through your,</v>

3392
02:18:27.600 --> 02:18:31.750
<v Speaker 5>part of the reason for that is that materialist atheism doesn't produce an</v>

3393
02:18:31.751 --> 02:18:32.584
<v Speaker 5>ethic.</v>

3394
02:18:32.980 --> 02:18:34.240
<v Speaker 5>That's a real problem.</v>

3395
02:18:34.570 --> 02:18:36.820
<v Speaker 5>And that's because there aren't things about materialism.</v>

3396
02:18:37.240 --> 02:18:39.630
<v Speaker 5>There's lots of things about the truth.</v>

3397
02:18:39.920 --> 02:18:44.110
<v Speaker 5>You can tell that by the technology will Howard is grass material,</v>

3398
02:18:44.970 --> 02:18:48.590
<v Speaker 5>but the downside of materialism and there's technical reasons for this stuff is</v>

3399
02:18:48.591 --> 02:18:49.290
<v Speaker 5>happening.</v>

3400
02:18:49.290 --> 02:18:53.620
<v Speaker 5>So it doesn't provide the way guiding yourself in the world.</v>

3401
02:18:53.680 --> 02:18:55.650
<v Speaker 5>That's actually a huge needle.</v>

3402
02:18:55.870 --> 02:18:56.720
<v Speaker 5>We have guidance.</v>

3403
02:18:58.060 --> 02:19:02.010
<v Speaker 5>So this is part of the problem that I have with Sam Harris for example,</v>

3404
02:19:02.011 --> 02:19:05.450
<v Speaker 5>is he tries to conjure an ethic code of his materialistic atheistic.</v>

3405
02:19:05.520 --> 02:19:05.890
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

3406
02:19:05.890 --> 02:19:06.041
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3407
02:19:06.041 --> 02:19:07.150
<v Speaker 5>good luck with that.</v>

3408
02:19:07.420 --> 02:19:09.200
<v Speaker 5>It's not obvious how to do that.</v>

3409
02:19:09.340 --> 02:19:11.860
<v Speaker 5>And that doesn't make me a critic of materialism.</v>

3410
02:19:12.130 --> 02:19:13.030
<v Speaker 5>I'm a scientist.</v>

3411
02:19:13.031 --> 02:19:13.510
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>

3412
02:19:13.510 --> 02:19:17.830
<v Speaker 5>I know the utility of the materialistic view mode and I'm very much appreciative</v>

3413
02:19:17.831 --> 02:19:19.340
<v Speaker 5>of the tech I want you to do is produced.</v>

3414
02:19:19.610 --> 02:19:22.780
<v Speaker 5>But bridging that gap to an ethic that's a big Bro.</v>

3415
02:19:22.990 --> 02:19:27.370
<v Speaker 5>And it's partly the reason that it's a problem is because science,</v>

3416
02:19:27.410 --> 02:19:31.490
<v Speaker 5>Chase's epics power up the argument technically.</v>

3417
02:19:32.240 --> 02:19:33.620
<v Speaker 5>Because what most schools can do,</v>

3418
02:19:33.621 --> 02:19:34.480
<v Speaker 5>if you're a science,</v>

3419
02:19:34.590 --> 02:19:35.423
<v Speaker 5>sorry,</v>

3420
02:19:35.460 --> 02:19:37.790
<v Speaker 5>get rid of the value judgements.</v>

3421
02:19:38.590 --> 02:19:38.751
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3422
02:19:38.751 --> 02:19:40.640
<v Speaker 5>that's not because the system,</v>

3423
02:19:40.880 --> 02:19:45.020
<v Speaker 5>it's because they interfere with your description of that lies beyond no</v>

3424
02:19:45.021 --> 02:19:45.854
<v Speaker 5>judgements,</v>

3425
02:19:45.980 --> 02:19:50.270
<v Speaker 5>but there's still the domain of value and contentment science camp 10 women say,</v>

3426
02:19:50.271 --> 02:19:50.391
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3427
02:19:50.391 --> 02:19:50.661
<v Speaker 5>if you say,</v>

3428
02:19:50.661 --> 02:19:50.781
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3429
02:19:50.781 --> 02:19:51.561
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't exist.</v>

3430
02:19:51.561 --> 02:19:51.910
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

3431
02:19:51.910 --> 02:19:52.743
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3432
02:19:53.060 --> 02:19:53.990
<v Speaker 5>that's wrong.</v>

3433
02:19:54.050 --> 02:19:55.040
<v Speaker 5>It's seriously,</v>

3434
02:19:55.041 --> 02:19:56.240
<v Speaker 5>seriously wrong.</v>

3435
02:19:56.300 --> 02:19:59.120
<v Speaker 5>It even exists as an empirical phenomena,</v>

3436
02:19:59.190 --> 02:20:01.700
<v Speaker 5>limited universe of value are we're,</v>

3437
02:20:01.701 --> 02:20:02.270
<v Speaker 5>we're,</v>

3438
02:20:02.270 --> 02:20:07.270
<v Speaker 5>we're neurologically adapted to a world of value to the serious flaws in that</v>

3439
02:20:07.530 --> 02:20:10.700
<v Speaker 5>serious flaws in them and breezy.</v>

3440
02:20:10.760 --> 02:20:15.760
<v Speaker 5>And it's hard on me because if you're hearing materialistic in your outlook and</v>

3441
02:20:16.251 --> 02:20:17.690
<v Speaker 5>you don't have an ethos to fall,</v>

3442
02:20:17.710 --> 02:20:18.543
<v Speaker 5>a tie was,</v>

3443
02:20:19.500 --> 02:20:22.240
<v Speaker 5>and I would say that's actually proof that there's something wrong with the</v>

3444
02:20:22.790 --> 02:20:23.623
<v Speaker 5>theory.</v>

3445
02:20:23.710 --> 02:20:26.360
<v Speaker 5>The theory makes you whole us and,</v>

3446
02:20:26.380 --> 02:20:26.681
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

3447
02:20:26.681 --> 02:20:27.020
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

3448
02:20:27.020 --> 02:20:29.400
<v Speaker 5>and deployed to the purpose and,</v>

3449
02:20:29.410 --> 02:20:29.990
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

3450
02:20:29.990 --> 02:20:33.980
<v Speaker 5>and what relates to bear to the suffering of life with no recourse.</v>

3451
02:20:34.210 --> 02:20:35.900
<v Speaker 5>If there's something wrong with period,</v>

3452
02:20:36.860 --> 02:20:37.693
<v Speaker 5>at least that's,</v>

3453
02:20:37.730 --> 02:20:38.630
<v Speaker 5>that's a possibility.</v>

3454
02:20:39.040 --> 02:20:40.700
<v Speaker 5>That's what it looks like to me.</v>

3455
02:20:41.490 --> 02:20:42.323
<v Speaker 5>This is,</v>

3456
02:20:42.630 --> 02:20:42.860
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3457
02:20:42.860 --> 02:20:43.700
<v Speaker 5>this is something else,</v>

3458
02:20:43.701 --> 02:20:45.220
<v Speaker 5>but you can go on after me.</v>

3459
02:20:45.890 --> 02:20:47.480
<v Speaker 5>There wasn't my decision Harris,</v>

3460
02:20:48.140 --> 02:20:50.690
<v Speaker 5>but I think that's mostly because they don't understand what the hell I'm</v>

3461
02:20:50.691 --> 02:20:51.524
<v Speaker 5>talking about.</v>

3462
02:20:51.620 --> 02:20:55.010
<v Speaker 5>One of the things neat you said was the truth serves life.</v>

3463
02:20:55.410 --> 02:20:57.290
<v Speaker 5>That's an definition</v>

3464
02:20:58.800 --> 02:21:00.020
<v Speaker 5>definition.</v>

3465
02:21:00.140 --> 02:21:03.920
<v Speaker 5>Say Well no one truth is truth is what you extract from an aggregation of</v>

3466
02:21:03.921 --> 02:21:05.810
<v Speaker 5>material fast find.</v>

3467
02:21:05.840 --> 02:21:06.890
<v Speaker 5>That's definition too,</v>

3468
02:21:06.891 --> 02:21:07.724
<v Speaker 5>but that doesn't,</v>

3469
02:21:07.890 --> 02:21:10.580
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't mean that that definition is a priori.</v>

3470
02:21:10.581 --> 02:21:11.414
<v Speaker 5>Correct.</v>

3471
02:21:11.690 --> 02:21:12.830
<v Speaker 5>Because you're not just,</v>

3472
02:21:12.980 --> 02:21:15.130
<v Speaker 5>you're not just a fact gathering creature.</v>

3473
02:21:15.230 --> 02:21:15.531
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

3474
02:21:15.531 --> 02:21:17.840
<v Speaker 5>your heart in fact cavity creature at all.</v>

3475
02:21:17.870 --> 02:21:20.360
<v Speaker 5>There's something that striving to live,</v>

3476
02:21:20.900 --> 02:21:23.630
<v Speaker 5>we need a truth that loves to distract live.</v>

3477
02:21:23.870 --> 02:21:27.710
<v Speaker 5>There's no evidence that the materialistic viewpoint provides that.</v>

3478
02:21:28.160 --> 02:21:28.491
<v Speaker 5>You say,</v>

3479
02:21:28.491 --> 02:21:28.641
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3480
02:21:28.641 --> 02:21:29.260
<v Speaker 5>it's complete.</v>

3481
02:21:29.260 --> 02:21:33.490
<v Speaker 5>It's like there's no evidence that it's complete and not only best separately.</v>

3482
02:21:33.500 --> 02:21:38.500
<v Speaker 5>The constant revision was like 15 years ago we found out that we didn't even</v>

3483
02:21:38.511 --> 02:21:41.720
<v Speaker 5>know what 95% of the universalist made up.</v>

3484
02:21:41.870 --> 02:21:44.360
<v Speaker 5>There's plenty of surprises yet to come.</v>

3485
02:21:44.840 --> 02:21:45.673
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

3486
02:21:46.130 --> 02:21:48.900
<v Speaker 5>so drew is the tricky thing then to tricky vague.</v>

3487
02:21:48.980 --> 02:21:51.590
<v Speaker 5>It's not self evident by any stretch of the imagination.</v>

3488
02:21:51.880 --> 02:21:53.100
<v Speaker 5>You whoa,</v>

3489
02:21:58.090 --> 02:21:59.660
<v Speaker 5>why didn't you take them to church?</v>

3490
02:22:00.560 --> 02:22:01.393
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3491
02:22:02.300 --> 02:22:03.320
<v Speaker 5>solve the problem.</v>

3492
02:22:03.340 --> 02:22:06.150
<v Speaker 5>And what's your advice for people with young children that maybe</v>

3493
02:22:08.280 --> 02:22:10.280
<v Speaker 5>you're stroking the church?</v>

3494
02:22:12.330 --> 02:22:13.260
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

3495
02:22:14.360 --> 02:22:15.193
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

3496
02:22:16.130 --> 02:22:18.080
<v Speaker 5>I be trying to puzzle it out.</v>

3497
02:22:18.140 --> 02:22:18.371
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3498
02:22:18.371 --> 02:22:20.280
<v Speaker 5>I have a friend and this chocolate passion,</v>

3499
02:22:21.740 --> 02:22:22.460
<v Speaker 5>he likes,</v>

3500
02:22:22.460 --> 02:22:24.410
<v Speaker 5>he likes the liturgical ceremonies,</v>

3501
02:22:24.411 --> 02:22:24.681
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3502
02:22:24.681 --> 02:22:26.520
<v Speaker 5>and he ever to go to the one in Seattle.</v>

3503
02:22:26.521 --> 02:22:28.530
<v Speaker 5>And I have to say we actually for that I've always had,</v>

3504
02:22:28.560 --> 02:22:30.000
<v Speaker 5>which was I can hardly wait til this is all,</v>

3505
02:22:30.230 --> 02:22:31.063
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

3506
02:22:31.750 --> 02:22:33.580
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible]</v>

3507
02:22:34.130 --> 02:22:34.963
<v Speaker 5>what was,</v>

3508
02:22:35.300 --> 02:22:36.510
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't always have,</v>

3509
02:22:38.820 --> 02:22:41.900
<v Speaker 5>I really wasn't a fan of school.</v>

3510
02:22:42.980 --> 02:22:45.620
<v Speaker 5>I had plenty of years that I was there.</v>

3511
02:22:45.850 --> 02:22:47.660
<v Speaker 5>And I think it's sitting in those,</v>

3512
02:22:48.210 --> 02:22:49.043
<v Speaker 5>in that</v>

3513
02:22:50.870 --> 02:22:52.880
<v Speaker 5>context brings that up.</v>

3514
02:22:53.870 --> 02:22:58.400
<v Speaker 5>I was so bored at school like I to just like all my things,</v>

3515
02:22:58.401 --> 02:23:02.180
<v Speaker 5>like I was serious before and I've had enough of that.</v>

3516
02:23:12.320 --> 02:23:12.510
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3517
02:23:12.510 --> 02:23:15.500
<v Speaker 5>I mean one of the things when I look back,</v>

3518
02:23:16.730 --> 02:23:17.930
<v Speaker 5>religious education,</v>

3519
02:23:17.931 --> 02:23:18.170
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3520
02:23:18.170 --> 02:23:19.600
<v Speaker 5>cause I went to [inaudible],</v>

3521
02:23:20.360 --> 02:23:22.040
<v Speaker 5>I did learn the stories,</v>

3522
02:23:25.020 --> 02:23:25.980
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3523
02:23:26.040 --> 02:23:27.430
<v Speaker 5>I was familiar enough with the story.</v>

3524
02:23:27.440 --> 02:23:29.030
<v Speaker 5>So they were in my imagination,</v>

3525
02:23:29.300 --> 02:23:30.260
<v Speaker 5>had turned out to be out.</v>

3526
02:23:30.380 --> 02:23:31.610
<v Speaker 5>Unbelievable work.</v>

3527
02:23:32.370 --> 02:23:36.740
<v Speaker 5>So I would say if you don't bring your kids to church,</v>

3528
02:23:36.741 --> 02:23:38.830
<v Speaker 5>then you have a problem with how the world of it,</v>

3529
02:23:38.831 --> 02:23:39.631
<v Speaker 5>where the store.</v>

3530
02:23:39.631 --> 02:23:44.631
<v Speaker 5>So because church has done a pretty good job preserving the transmitting stories</v>

3531
02:23:46.240 --> 02:23:48.530
<v Speaker 5>and I think the stories are necessary and useful.</v>

3532
02:23:49.220 --> 02:23:50.040
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

3533
02:23:50.040 --> 02:23:51.740
<v Speaker 5>but I don't have a better solution than that.</v>

3534
02:23:51.741 --> 02:23:51.960
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3535
02:23:51.960 --> 02:23:52.793
<v Speaker 5>you put</v>

3536
02:23:54.810 --> 02:23:55.643
<v Speaker 5>wild.</v>

3537
02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:56.840
<v Speaker 5>Well you could,</v>

3538
02:23:56.841 --> 02:23:58.690
<v Speaker 5>but it takes a lot of discipline with them.</v>

3539
02:23:59.050 --> 02:23:59.883
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3540
02:23:59.930 --> 02:24:02.660
<v Speaker 5>it's often something that you might want to parse off to someone else.</v>

3541
02:24:02.661 --> 02:24:02.841
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3542
02:24:02.841 --> 02:24:03.860
<v Speaker 5>maybe it can handle it.</v>

3543
02:24:03.861 --> 02:24:04.730
<v Speaker 5>Maybe we'll do it.</v>

3544
02:24:05.060 --> 02:24:05.893
<v Speaker 5>You can read to them,</v>

3545
02:24:05.920 --> 02:24:06.381
<v Speaker 5>so on.</v>

3546
02:24:06.381 --> 02:24:08.450
<v Speaker 5>But if it's a major commitment,</v>

3547
02:24:10.070 --> 02:24:12.090
<v Speaker 5>so yeah,</v>

3548
02:24:19.250 --> 02:24:20.730
<v Speaker 5>I'd like to say yes.</v>

3549
02:24:26.250 --> 02:24:26.581
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3550
02:24:26.581 --> 02:24:29.160
<v Speaker 5>they learn most of the stories could be in my house.</v>

3551
02:24:31.490 --> 02:24:33.630
<v Speaker 5>So maybe I managed that.</v>

3552
02:24:33.940 --> 02:24:34.773
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3553
02:24:35.250 --> 02:24:38.810
<v Speaker 5>I'm very ambivalent about that because part of me thinks that I should go.</v>

3554
02:24:45.950 --> 02:24:47.290
<v Speaker 5>Probably I should go.</v>

3555
02:24:48.290 --> 02:24:49.123
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3556
02:24:51.390 --> 02:24:52.223
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3557
02:24:52.380 --> 02:24:53.430
<v Speaker 5>you said that you,</v>

3558
02:24:53.431 --> 02:24:54.010
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3559
02:24:54.010 --> 02:24:58.270
<v Speaker 5>sit here of individual be a collection of semi-independent motivations.</v>

3560
02:24:58.800 --> 02:25:03.800
<v Speaker 5>And I was wondering if that scales up to say a business with maybe like a horde</v>

3561
02:25:05.730 --> 02:25:06.740
<v Speaker 5>of consciousness.</v>

3562
02:25:06.770 --> 02:25:11.770
<v Speaker 5>They don't wonder Mike that also scale up to say a government maybe could,</v>

3563
02:25:12.510 --> 02:25:17.340
<v Speaker 5>the way you conceptualize this rules maybe apply to some of these people</v>

3564
02:25:17.350 --> 02:25:21.700
<v Speaker 5>wondering what should the principles of maybe self governance be?</v>

3565
02:25:21.710 --> 02:25:24.160
<v Speaker 5>Maybe if we figure out maybe</v>

3566
02:25:24.160 --> 02:25:24.993
<v Speaker 1>that scales up</v>

3567
02:25:27.360 --> 02:25:32.360
<v Speaker 1>question to that brings up is how does kind of looking inside avoid becoming</v>

3568
02:25:33.830 --> 02:25:35.760
<v Speaker 1>jingoistic right?</v>

3569
02:25:35.761 --> 02:25:36.561
<v Speaker 1>So like if,</v>

3570
02:25:36.561 --> 02:25:41.340
<v Speaker 1>if if the government is looking into itself first in order to solve its</v>

3571
02:25:41.341 --> 02:25:42.174
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>

3572
02:25:42.580 --> 02:25:46.370
<v Speaker 1>what separates that and then that same question skills down like how do you a</v>

3573
02:25:46.560 --> 02:25:49.720
<v Speaker 1>and being self centered when you're focusing on,</v>

3574
02:25:50.270 --> 02:25:50.941
<v Speaker 1>you see what I'm saying?</v>

3575
02:25:50.941 --> 02:25:51.774
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3576
02:25:51.810 --> 02:25:53.490
<v Speaker 1>It becomes obvious when you scale it up,</v>

3577
02:25:53.491 --> 02:25:54.550
<v Speaker 1>but how does it would,</v>

3578
02:25:55.360 --> 02:25:56.193
<v Speaker 1>when it scales</v>

3579
02:25:57.870 --> 02:26:01.810
<v Speaker 1>me self centered is actually a good solution to the problems that you,</v>

3580
02:26:02.310 --> 02:26:02.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3581
02:26:02.800 --> 02:26:06.740
<v Speaker 1>because you might say as a collection of semi autonomous spirits,</v>

3582
02:26:06.741 --> 02:26:11.510
<v Speaker 1>which is certainly the psychoanalytic point and I think a biological viewpoint</v>

3583
02:26:11.511 --> 02:26:12.080
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>

3584
02:26:12.080 --> 02:26:13.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean you,</v>

3585
02:26:13.640 --> 02:26:18.440
<v Speaker 1>you are a center that degration but you're definitely also a collection of semi</v>

3586
02:26:18.441 --> 02:26:20.060
<v Speaker 1>autonomous processes.</v>

3587
02:26:20.360 --> 02:26:20.900
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3588
02:26:20.900 --> 02:26:21.733
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3589
02:26:22.340 --> 02:26:24.750
<v Speaker 1>the question is how to bring those into the unity.</v>

3590
02:26:24.840 --> 02:26:25.371
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>

3591
02:26:25.371 --> 02:26:26.960
<v Speaker 1>well you do that by,</v>

3592
02:26:26.961 --> 02:26:31.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't pick the self centered perspective to bring those into unity,</v>

3593
02:26:31.041 --> 02:26:32.570
<v Speaker 1>but unity isn't,</v>

3594
02:26:32.930 --> 02:26:34.160
<v Speaker 1>isn't self centered.</v>

3595
02:26:34.220 --> 02:26:35.460
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reason for that,</v>

3596
02:26:35.461 --> 02:26:36.710
<v Speaker 1>and I kind of like that tonight,</v>

3597
02:26:37.320 --> 02:26:40.430
<v Speaker 1>you get those things operating harmoniously together.</v>

3598
02:26:40.710 --> 02:26:42.800
<v Speaker 1>Just what you do is socialize a child.</v>

3599
02:26:43.730 --> 02:26:47.300
<v Speaker 1>They have to be serving the child's interest now but in a way that doesn't need</v>

3600
02:26:47.301 --> 02:26:50.660
<v Speaker 1>to fear what the child's interests as it propagates across time.</v>

3601
02:26:50.750 --> 02:26:53.420
<v Speaker 1>And that's an unbelievably tight set of constraints.</v>

3602
02:26:53.421 --> 02:26:54.680
<v Speaker 1>And you see that operating,</v>

3603
02:26:54.681 --> 02:26:55.770
<v Speaker 1>I didn't talk about this time.</v>

3604
02:26:55.771 --> 02:26:57.770
<v Speaker 1>And you see that offer even in the animal kingdom,</v>

3605
02:26:58.400 --> 02:27:01.880
<v Speaker 1>you know when animals organized there hierarchies I know that aren't going to</v>

3606
02:27:01.881 --> 02:27:04.220
<v Speaker 1>organize themselves in a manner of its purity,</v>

3607
02:27:04.240 --> 02:27:05.360
<v Speaker 1>self-serving if they're,</v>

3608
02:27:05.380 --> 02:27:08.850
<v Speaker 1>if they're social animals and they also organize them in a way.</v>

3609
02:27:08.900 --> 02:27:13.330
<v Speaker 1>Keeps the rights of the other elements in mind as they organized the threats.</v>

3610
02:27:13.380 --> 02:27:13.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3611
02:27:13.820 --> 02:27:17.510
<v Speaker 1>The rats are like the walls are like the chimpanzees know so,</v>

3612
02:27:17.570 --> 02:27:19.350
<v Speaker 1>so that's self center need.</v>

3613
02:27:19.530 --> 02:27:22.220
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't need to work parameters much less for us.</v>

3614
02:27:22.930 --> 02:27:23.240
<v Speaker 1>It's so,</v>

3615
02:27:23.240 --> 02:27:24.960
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's because things have,</v>

3616
02:27:25.220 --> 02:27:27.710
<v Speaker 1>I think it's because things have to iterate across time,</v>

3617
02:27:27.760 --> 02:27:32.720
<v Speaker 1>headed up the rules for successful iteration produce very,</v>

3618
02:27:32.721 --> 02:27:36.500
<v Speaker 1>very tight constraints on behavior in any particular situation.</v>

3619
02:27:37.080 --> 02:27:38.600
<v Speaker 1>So you get an emergent debt.</v>

3620
02:27:39.370 --> 02:27:41.460
<v Speaker 1>What do you think that scales the same way.</v>

3621
02:27:41.461 --> 02:27:43.880
<v Speaker 1>The bigger you get to say with the company and with,</v>

3622
02:27:44.170 --> 02:27:45.410
<v Speaker 1>with maybe a governor like,</v>

3623
02:27:45.440 --> 02:27:49.000
<v Speaker 1>well I don't know because I think things can get so fake and he just call,</v>

3624
02:27:49.480 --> 02:27:50.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3625
02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.440
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the lesson of the Tower of Babel.</v>

3626
02:27:52.520 --> 02:27:54.000
<v Speaker 1>It might even be the lesson up.</v>

3627
02:27:54.080 --> 02:27:54.913
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3628
02:27:55.450 --> 02:28:00.290
<v Speaker 1>the European Economic Union might be less than that.</v>

3629
02:28:00.291 --> 02:28:01.250
<v Speaker 1>The United States too,</v>

3630
02:28:01.251 --> 02:28:03.190
<v Speaker 1>because sometimes I take that about the last,</v>

3631
02:28:03.191 --> 02:28:05.330
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just to me,</v>

3632
02:28:05.331 --> 02:28:06.380
<v Speaker 1>certainly California</v>

3633
02:28:06.970 --> 02:28:11.970
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible]</v>

3634
02:28:13.670 --> 02:28:14.503
<v Speaker 1>so big.</v>

3635
02:28:14.510 --> 02:28:16.570
<v Speaker 1>It is clear that it can be</v>

3636
02:28:18.500 --> 02:28:20.290
<v Speaker 1>like what you do to your presidents.</v>

3637
02:28:20.291 --> 02:28:21.124
<v Speaker 1>It's just like</v>

3638
02:28:23.510 --> 02:28:24.343
<v Speaker 5>too much.</v>

3639
02:28:25.250 --> 02:28:26.240
<v Speaker 5>It's just too much.</v>

3640
02:28:26.520 --> 02:28:26.701
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3641
02:28:26.701 --> 02:28:28.270
<v Speaker 5>it's 300 million people.</v>

3642
02:28:31.150 --> 02:28:32.710
<v Speaker 5>Luckily it's the person</v>

3643
02:28:35.910 --> 02:28:36.581
<v Speaker 5>that's part of it.</v>

3644
02:28:36.581 --> 02:28:40.770
<v Speaker 5>We are addressing them to make the units more autonomous.</v>

3645
02:28:42.900 --> 02:28:43.520
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3646
02:28:43.520 --> 02:28:43.851
<v Speaker 5>sorry,</v>

3647
02:28:43.851 --> 02:28:44.684
<v Speaker 5>this May</v>

3648
02:29:04.630 --> 02:29:09.630
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

3649
02:30:06.950 --> 02:30:11.950
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

3650
02:30:15.560 --> 02:30:17.520
<v Speaker 5>I can't give you any detail just</v>

3651
02:30:19.350 --> 02:30:21.710
<v Speaker 5>because I don't know what he said.</v>

3652
02:30:21.711 --> 02:30:22.544
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3653
02:30:31.620 --> 02:30:32.453
<v Speaker 5>I'm glad.</v>

3654
02:31:22.550 --> 02:31:26.550
<v Speaker 5>So then for you guys to do it and not only you and I just had a core like we</v>

3655
02:31:26.551 --> 02:31:28.140
<v Speaker 5>were just kind of thing.</v>

3656
02:31:28.160 --> 02:31:28.993
<v Speaker 5>So the ones that,</v>

3657
02:31:30.010 --> 02:31:30.310
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

3658
02:31:30.310 --> 02:31:31.330
<v Speaker 5>this is amazing,</v>

3659
02:31:32.210 --> 02:31:33.360
<v Speaker 5>but it's also kind of mediator,</v>

3660
02:31:34.170 --> 02:31:39.170
<v Speaker 5>I think other folks to be hopefully more rise to all because of one of the</v>

3661
02:31:39.820 --> 02:31:44.820
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] just really special time.</v>

3662
02:31:48.130 --> 02:31:48.963
<v Speaker 5>Reuben,</v>

3663
02:31:51.830 --> 02:31:52.740
<v Speaker 5>the one thing</v>

3664
02:31:58.730 --> 02:31:59.563
<v Speaker 5>I</v>

3665
02:32:01.420 --> 02:32:06.040
<v Speaker 5>find that I'm sure you pick up on this bill,</v>

3666
02:32:06.090 --> 02:32:06.481
<v Speaker 5>Sam,</v>

3667
02:32:06.481 --> 02:32:10.610
<v Speaker 5>about what clubs and that kind of have that similar kind of mid eighties</v>

3668
02:32:13.710 --> 02:32:14.543
<v Speaker 5>about religion</v>

3669
02:32:17.700 --> 02:32:18.940
<v Speaker 5>and hopefully someday.</v>

3670
02:32:20.010 --> 02:32:24.450
<v Speaker 5>What I noticed is you said a little bit here earlier,</v>

3671
02:32:24.480 --> 02:32:26.520
<v Speaker 5>but not with kind of the tone.</v>

3672
02:32:26.570 --> 02:32:27.350
<v Speaker 5>What's it?</v>

3673
02:32:27.350 --> 02:32:28.740
<v Speaker 5>Some of the times it comes across.</v>

3674
02:32:32.370 --> 02:32:36.090
<v Speaker 5>My concern is that he's such an awesome time.</v>

3675
02:32:37.050 --> 02:32:37.883
<v Speaker 5>There's an origin,</v>

3676
02:32:40.150 --> 02:32:43.650
<v Speaker 5>a polarization of sharecroppers.</v>

3677
02:32:51.140 --> 02:32:53.880
<v Speaker 5>If some of the posts he was on paper,</v>

3678
02:32:54.370 --> 02:32:54.910
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3679
02:32:54.910 --> 02:32:55.743
<v Speaker 5>what's today?</v>

3680
02:32:56.750 --> 02:32:57.980
<v Speaker 5>And I noticed</v>

3681
02:33:03.310 --> 02:33:08.310
<v Speaker 5>like here,</v>

3682
02:33:09.270 --> 02:33:10.103
<v Speaker 5>I would see</v>

3683
02:33:12.610 --> 02:33:14.210
<v Speaker 5>recoverable the careful way.</v>

3684
02:33:14.220 --> 02:33:16.680
<v Speaker 5>Not to fix it too much on you,</v>

3685
02:33:16.700 --> 02:33:17.710
<v Speaker 5>but just as you're,</v>

3686
02:33:18.120 --> 02:33:19.020
<v Speaker 5>as you said,</v>

3687
02:33:19.140 --> 02:33:19.710
<v Speaker 5>these are,</v>

3688
02:33:19.710 --> 02:33:20.850
<v Speaker 5>these are cut of,</v>

3689
02:33:21.180 --> 02:33:23.480
<v Speaker 5>maybe the presentation is something,</v>

3690
02:33:23.890 --> 02:33:25.210
<v Speaker 5>but it is or not,</v>

3691
02:33:25.211 --> 02:33:29.800
<v Speaker 5>but just like seeing him kind of doing some variation of the same.</v>

3692
02:33:32.850 --> 02:33:35.690
<v Speaker 5>And the reason why is that why it's important because</v>

3693
02:33:38.380 --> 02:33:41.400
<v Speaker 5>I think you guys had an opportunity to really,</v>

3694
02:33:45.980 --> 02:33:50.630
<v Speaker 5>just because of the nature of folks who work with are perceived to be</v>

3695
02:33:50.720 --> 02:33:51.553
<v Speaker 5>conservative,</v>

3696
02:33:52.380 --> 02:33:53.730
<v Speaker 5>are going to the attack.</v>

3697
02:33:56.090 --> 02:33:56.910
<v Speaker 5>Be careful not to,</v>

3698
02:33:56.910 --> 02:34:01.910
<v Speaker 5>you almost have to be stark apartments before any power was every possible</v>

3699
02:34:03.930 --> 02:34:04.763
<v Speaker 5>energy.</v>

3700
02:34:05.570 --> 02:34:06.403
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

3701
02:34:08.140 --> 02:34:10.010
<v Speaker 5>Because sometimes they ask,</v>

3702
02:34:10.020 --> 02:34:11.220
<v Speaker 5>you get so cash in your life.</v>

3703
02:34:14.410 --> 02:34:16.500
<v Speaker 5>Luckily the people that aren't that is to certainly go,</v>

3704
02:34:16.510 --> 02:34:17.620
<v Speaker 5>maybe this is,</v>

3705
02:34:19.380 --> 02:34:20.213
<v Speaker 5>what am I going to say</v>

3706
02:34:20.550 --> 02:34:21.383
<v Speaker 4>and</v>

3707
02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:24.833
<v Speaker 4>be that example.</v>

3708
02:34:35.880 --> 02:34:37.710
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

3709
02:34:37.820 --> 02:34:38.653
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

3710
02:34:42.830 --> 02:34:47.830
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] [inaudible].</v>
