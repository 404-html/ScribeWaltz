00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:08.070
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.430
<v Speaker 1>so last week you talked about how you hated people ask you if you believe in God</v>

3
00:00:12.431 --> 00:00:13.770
<v Speaker 1>and or do you believe miracles are,</v>

4
00:00:13.771 --> 00:00:15.000
<v Speaker 1>you just liked those questions at least,</v>

5
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.280
<v Speaker 1>but you also talked about how,</v>

6
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:18.430
<v Speaker 1>and I want to put words in your mouth,</v>

7
00:00:18.431 --> 00:00:20.540
<v Speaker 1>but I think he said something about the ideas,</v>

8
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.690
<v Speaker 1>an empirical evidence for religious experiences or spiritual experiences.</v>

9
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.930
<v Speaker 1>And I wonder how those two ideas like can a spiritual existence or can a</v>

10
00:00:30.031 --> 00:00:32.990
<v Speaker 1>spiritual experience exist without God or how did I,</v>

11
00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:33.824
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>

12
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.943
<v Speaker 2>who knows,</v>

13
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.353
<v Speaker 2>who knows?</v>

14
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.170
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

15
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.003
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what.</v>

16
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to make of that.</v>

17
00:00:39.391 --> 00:00:39.661
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

18
00:00:39.661 --> 00:00:40.051
<v Speaker 2>you could,</v>

19
00:00:40.051 --> 00:00:42.930
<v Speaker 2>it depends on what you're willing to accept as proof.</v>

20
00:00:42.931 --> 00:00:45.780
<v Speaker 2>I suppose that's where things get tricky,</v>

21
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:46.561
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

22
00:00:46.561 --> 00:00:51.150
<v Speaker 2>if you have to demonstrate the existence of God objectively than subjective</v>

23
00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:53.880
<v Speaker 2>experiences of the transcendent are irrelevant.</v>

24
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.380
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

25
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.213
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

26
00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.860
<v Speaker 2>and that's a perfectly reasonable standpoint.</v>

27
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.570
<v Speaker 2>If your initial presupposition is the only thing that has actual existence is</v>

28
00:01:03.571 --> 00:01:05.850
<v Speaker 2>those things that can be demonstrated objectively.</v>

29
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.740
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not putting that down.</v>

30
00:01:07.741 --> 00:01:10.110
<v Speaker 2>Like that's a powerful methodology.</v>

31
00:01:10.111 --> 00:01:13.560
<v Speaker 2>Our technology is basically dependent on the acceptance,</v>

32
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.200
<v Speaker 2>at least a partial acceptance of those axioms.</v>

33
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.710
<v Speaker 2>But I also think that it's difficult for me to deny the existence of these</v>

34
00:01:24.721 --> 00:01:27.900
<v Speaker 2>patterns of thinking that seemed to exist cross culturally,</v>

35
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.470
<v Speaker 2>like the existence of the representation of the Dragon,</v>

36
00:01:31.471 --> 00:01:32.304
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

37
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.320
<v Speaker 2>Especially given that I can see an evolutionary rationale for the emergence of</v>

38
00:01:37.321 --> 00:01:38.580
<v Speaker 2>these representations.</v>

39
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.080
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

40
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.080
<v Speaker 2>and then there's also the indisputable fact that religious experiences are</v>

41
00:01:45.811 --> 00:01:50.640
<v Speaker 2>accessible to people through a number of different avenues.</v>

42
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.680
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

43
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.630
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things I mentioned when I discussed this before as well,</v>

44
00:01:55.631 --> 00:01:56.221
<v Speaker 2>you could say,</v>

45
00:01:56.221 --> 00:01:56.401
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

46
00:01:56.401 --> 00:02:00.690
<v Speaker 2>those are no different than experiences of psychopathology,</v>

47
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.580
<v Speaker 2>but they are different because the experiences of psychopathology damage people,</v>

48
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.350
<v Speaker 2>where's the evidence is that the transcendent experiences actually help people.</v>

49
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.820
<v Speaker 2>So unless you can,</v>

50
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.050
<v Speaker 2>unless you're willing to say,</v>

51
00:02:13.051 --> 00:02:13.231
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

52
00:02:13.231 --> 00:02:16.950
<v Speaker 2>there are some forms of psychopathological experience that actually facilitate</v>

53
00:02:16.951 --> 00:02:17.580
<v Speaker 2>health,</v>

54
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.770
<v Speaker 2>which is a possibility.</v>

55
00:02:19.771 --> 00:02:20.310
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

56
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.143
<v Speaker 2>I think you're,</v>

57
00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.180
<v Speaker 2>you're pushing your hypo yearly hypothesis at that point.</v>
