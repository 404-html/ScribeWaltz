00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.200
<v Speaker 1>Maelstrom,</v>

2
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.110
<v Speaker 1>who is apparently chaos given the name asked me,</v>

3
00:00:04.111 --> 00:00:05.970
<v Speaker 1>am I chaos or am I order?</v>

4
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:07.261
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5
00:00:07.261 --> 00:00:08.160
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>

6
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:10.620
<v Speaker 1>I would say a lot of the time I'm chaos,</v>

7
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.170
<v Speaker 1>but I do everything I can to put things in order.</v>

8
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:14.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

9
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.190
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to answer that in a deeper way.</v>

10
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.061
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

11
00:00:18.061 --> 00:00:19.830
<v Speaker 1>because first of all,</v>

12
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.430
<v Speaker 1>everything and everyone is chaos and order at the same time.</v>

13
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.890
<v Speaker 1>And I don't mean that in a trait sense.</v>

14
00:00:25.891 --> 00:00:27.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean in a technical sense,</v>

15
00:00:27.391 --> 00:00:28.710
<v Speaker 1>which is order.</v>

16
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.600
<v Speaker 1>Technically speaking in my way of viewing the world is order is that domain you</v>

17
00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:37.590
<v Speaker 1>inhabit when what you're doing produces the results that you want to have</v>

18
00:00:37.591 --> 00:00:38.190
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

19
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.600
<v Speaker 1>That's a pragmatic perspective from,</v>

20
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.120
<v Speaker 1>from a philosophical perspective,</v>

21
00:00:42.121 --> 00:00:45.930
<v Speaker 1>it's derived at least in part or is it analogous to the pragmatism of people</v>

22
00:00:45.931 --> 00:00:46.640
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

23
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.473
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

24
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:48.693
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

25
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.600
<v Speaker 1>cs purse and William James,</v>

26
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:52.770
<v Speaker 1>the American PR,</v>

27
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.660
<v Speaker 1>the early American pragmatists.</v>

28
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:55.883
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

29
00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.370
<v Speaker 1>and there's a great book on all that if you're interested,</v>

30
00:00:59.371 --> 00:01:00.570
<v Speaker 1>called the metaphysical club.</v>

31
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

32
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.990
<v Speaker 1>so order is where you are when what you're doing is producing the results that</v>

33
00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:09.150
<v Speaker 1>you intended and that validates what you're doing.</v>

34
00:01:09.151 --> 00:01:09.571
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

35
00:01:09.571 --> 00:01:11.280
<v Speaker 1>that that's a pragmatic form of truth.</v>

36
00:01:11.281 --> 00:01:16.190
<v Speaker 1>Your theory is accurate when if you enact it then the results that you intend</v>

37
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.920
<v Speaker 1>emerge.</v>

38
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.480
<v Speaker 1>That's the definition of truth.</v>

39
00:01:18.481 --> 00:01:19.720
<v Speaker 1>From a pragmatic perspective,</v>

40
00:01:19.721 --> 00:01:23.640
<v Speaker 1>it's a very powerful definition and it's very much associated with the Darwinian</v>

41
00:01:23.641 --> 00:01:24.480
<v Speaker 1>notion of truth.</v>

42
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.130
<v Speaker 1>So that's worth,</v>

43
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.780
<v Speaker 1>that's worth looking into.</v>

44
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.320
<v Speaker 1>Now obviously there are times when you implement a plan and and at world</v>

45
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.300
<v Speaker 1>conception that goes along with that plan and what you wanted didn't happen.</v>

46
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.690
<v Speaker 1>And so then the domain of chaos comes up,</v>

47
00:01:42.691 --> 00:01:45.960
<v Speaker 1>the domain of the unpredictable and unexpected and you have to contend with it.</v>

48
00:01:45.961 --> 00:01:48.990
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes when you are acting,</v>

49
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.110
<v Speaker 1>you do perverse things and things that surprise you and then things don't work</v>

50
00:01:55.171 --> 00:01:56.490
<v Speaker 1>out well for you.</v>

51
00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.510
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe you get a surprise and maybe sometimes that might even be positive and</v>

52
00:02:00.511 --> 00:02:04.110
<v Speaker 1>that's because the chaos within new as manifested itself and you've done</v>

53
00:02:04.111 --> 00:02:08.430
<v Speaker 1>something that exceeds the bounds of your understanding and you know that can</v>

54
00:02:08.431 --> 00:02:11.470
<v Speaker 1>happen to people so badly that they developed post traumatic stress,</v>

55
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.290
<v Speaker 1>posttraumatic stress disorder.</v>

56
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.850
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes soldiers,</v>

57
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.740
<v Speaker 1>especially naive young soldiers,</v>

58
00:02:16.741 --> 00:02:19.860
<v Speaker 1>will go on a battlefield and watched themselves do something they can't imagine</v>

59
00:02:19.861 --> 00:02:23.070
<v Speaker 1>they're capable of doing and then they have permanent post traumatic stress</v>

60
00:02:23.071 --> 00:02:23.760
<v Speaker 1>disorder.</v>

61
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.940
<v Speaker 1>So there's a chaos within that can manifest itself,</v>

62
00:02:26.941 --> 00:02:29.550
<v Speaker 1>that can disrupt whatever order you are.</v>

63
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

64
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.240
<v Speaker 1>and you know that minor ways because everybody's always running around doing</v>

65
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:34.950
<v Speaker 1>things that aren't good for them,</v>

66
00:02:34.951 --> 00:02:37.470
<v Speaker 1>that they know they shouldn't do and that they can't control.</v>

67
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.520
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a chaotic and an orderly aspect to everything,</v>

68
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:42.780
<v Speaker 1>to the individual,</v>

69
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.041
<v Speaker 1>to the family,</v>

70
00:02:44.041 --> 00:02:44.970
<v Speaker 1>to the social world,</v>

71
00:02:44.971 --> 00:02:45.930
<v Speaker 1>to the natural world.</v>

72
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.710
<v Speaker 1>It's chaos and order at every level of analysis simultaneously,</v>

73
00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:52.830
<v Speaker 1>which is why the Dallas think of the world is made out of Yin and Yang,</v>

74
00:02:52.831 --> 00:02:53.790
<v Speaker 1>which is essentially,</v>

75
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.853
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

76
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.360
<v Speaker 1>analogous to the idea of order and chaos.</v>

77
00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:58.643
<v Speaker 1>And now,</v>

78
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.910
<v Speaker 1>but then there's another element too.</v>

79
00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:04.960
<v Speaker 1>So your order and your chaos and the place that you live,</v>

80
00:03:04.961 --> 00:03:07.150
<v Speaker 1>the environment is order and chaos as well.</v>

81
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.170
<v Speaker 1>But you're also the process that mediates between the two.</v>

82
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.340
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is you're the forest that confronts chaos and casts it into</v>

83
00:03:15.341 --> 00:03:15.731
<v Speaker 1>order.</v>

84
00:03:15.731 --> 00:03:17.740
<v Speaker 1>We talked about that in the freewill discussion.</v>

85
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.110
<v Speaker 1>That's the basis for the dragon math,</v>

86
00:03:20.111 --> 00:03:20.980
<v Speaker 1>or at least part of it,</v>

87
00:03:20.981 --> 00:03:21.814
<v Speaker 1>the hero myth.</v>

88
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.810
<v Speaker 1>You are the forest that confronts chaos and transforms it into habitable order.</v>

89
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.260
<v Speaker 1>And there's an idea that if you do that using truthful speech,</v>

90
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.330
<v Speaker 1>it's probably the deepest idea in the Bible.</v>

91
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.890
<v Speaker 1>If you confront chaos and the unknown using truthful speech,</v>

92
00:03:35.891 --> 00:03:38.320
<v Speaker 1>then the order that you produce is good.</v>

93
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.130
<v Speaker 1>So that also means that your chaos and order and the process that intermediates</v>

94
00:03:44.231 --> 00:03:45.064
<v Speaker 1>between them,</v>

95
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.020
<v Speaker 1>and that's really the basis of the hero myth.</v>

96
00:03:47.021 --> 00:03:50.440
<v Speaker 1>So part of that is the hero story and the Dragon Myth.</v>

97
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.071
<v Speaker 1>Go Out,</v>

98
00:03:51.071 --> 00:03:52.570
<v Speaker 1>confront the drag and get the gold,</v>

99
00:03:52.571 --> 00:03:53.291
<v Speaker 1>bring it back,</v>

100
00:03:53.291 --> 00:03:54.490
<v Speaker 1>share it with the community.</v>

101
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.890
<v Speaker 1>And the dragon is a representation of that which dwells beyond the confines of</v>

102
00:03:59.891 --> 00:04:02.020
<v Speaker 1>the safe and habitable space.</v>

103
00:04:02.021 --> 00:04:02.231
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

104
00:04:02.231 --> 00:04:03.730
<v Speaker 1>It's an image of a predator.</v>

105
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:04.870
<v Speaker 1>That's part of what it is.</v>

106
00:04:04.871 --> 00:04:06.610
<v Speaker 1>Although it's way more complicated than that.</v>

107
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.320
<v Speaker 1>And you're also the forest that confronts order when it becomes too tyrannical</v>

108
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.590
<v Speaker 1>and restructures it back to chaos and then restructures the chaos back into more</v>

109
00:04:16.871 --> 00:04:17.890
<v Speaker 1>beneficial order,</v>

110
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.911
<v Speaker 1>which is what you do.</v>

111
00:04:18.911 --> 00:04:19.541
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

112
00:04:19.541 --> 00:04:22.300
<v Speaker 1>if you have an argument with someone that you settle,</v>

113
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.901
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

114
00:04:22.901 --> 00:04:25.420
<v Speaker 1>Cause the argument takes the orderly,</v>

115
00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:26.530
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

116
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.460
<v Speaker 1>relation that you have with that person and then produces a chaotic interlude,</v>

117
00:04:30.461 --> 00:04:32.890
<v Speaker 1>which is all the pain that's associated with the argument.</v>

118
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.310
<v Speaker 1>And that's a dissolution into what Mircea Eliade called pre cosmic gone chaos.</v>

119
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.461
<v Speaker 1>And out of that,</v>

120
00:04:39.461 --> 00:04:40.780
<v Speaker 1>a new order can emerge.</v>

121
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.970
<v Speaker 1>And so the best way to construe yourself is not as chaos or as order,</v>

122
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.630
<v Speaker 1>but as the process that mediates between the,</v>

123
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.010
<v Speaker 1>and that's the basis for the ethos of the West is that the human being is best</v>

124
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.410
<v Speaker 1>represented as the individual and the individual is that attentive and</v>

125
00:04:59.411 --> 00:05:04.411
<v Speaker 1>communicative entity that is continually capable of mediating properly between</v>

126
00:05:04.991 --> 00:05:05.860
<v Speaker 1>chaos and order.</v>

127
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.050
<v Speaker 1>Now this is a deep idea.</v>

128
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.200
<v Speaker 1>You could read maps of meaning if you would like.</v>

129
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.020
<v Speaker 1>The audio version of that is coming out June 12th,</v>

130
00:05:14.021 --> 00:05:14.740
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

131
00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.190
<v Speaker 1>And I will make a video detailing the relationship between maps of meaning and</v>

132
00:05:18.191 --> 00:05:19.270
<v Speaker 1>12 rules of life.</v>

133
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.220
<v Speaker 1>But you can construe yourself,</v>

134
00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.660
<v Speaker 1>you should construe yourself as the process that mediates between chaos and</v>

135
00:05:25.661 --> 00:05:26.380
<v Speaker 1>order.</v>

136
00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.880
<v Speaker 1>And you should aim to be the process that does that properly using truthful</v>

137
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.410
<v Speaker 1>communication because that's how you keep the elements of existence properly</v>

138
00:05:35.411 --> 00:05:36.190
<v Speaker 1>balanced.</v>

139
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.821
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>

140
00:05:36.821 --> 00:05:37.061
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

141
00:05:37.061 --> 00:05:38.320
<v Speaker 1>but is that real?</v>

142
00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:39.573
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

143
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.170
<v Speaker 1>if you read maps of meaning,</v>

144
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.460
<v Speaker 1>there's a section on neuropsychology that's also buttressed by a book written by</v>

145
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.510
<v Speaker 1>Ian Mcgilchrist called the master and his emissary that lays out the</v>

146
00:05:49.511 --> 00:05:52.240
<v Speaker 1>relationship between the right and left hand Miss Hemisphere.</v>

147
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.751
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

148
00:05:52.751 --> 00:05:55.660
<v Speaker 1>it's quite strange that we have a right and left hemisphere.</v>

149
00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.000
<v Speaker 1>It's almost as if we have two consciousnesses dwelling in our,</v>

150
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:00.140
<v Speaker 1>in our,</v>

151
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.740
<v Speaker 1>in our,</v>

152
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:01.573
<v Speaker 1>in our being,</v>

153
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:03.470
<v Speaker 1>and they're quite separable.</v>

154
00:06:03.471 --> 00:06:05.810
<v Speaker 1>If you cut the Corpus callosum that unites the two,</v>

155
00:06:05.811 --> 00:06:08.780
<v Speaker 1>then the two hemispheres will act independently to some degree.</v>

156
00:06:08.781 --> 00:06:11.180
<v Speaker 1>You can communicate with each of them somewhat independently,</v>

157
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.370
<v Speaker 1>so they actually view the world quite differently.</v>

158
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.210
<v Speaker 1>And that that hemisphere distinction is not only they're human beings,</v>

159
00:06:17.211 --> 00:06:19.880
<v Speaker 1>but also an animal's along way down the phylogenetic chain.</v>

160
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.570
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

161
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:25.570
<v Speaker 1>I made the claim partly because I was reading a man named m e l Conan Goldberg,</v>

162
00:06:25.671 --> 00:06:27.740
<v Speaker 1>who was a student of Alexander Luria,</v>

163
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:30.470
<v Speaker 1>the most brilliant neuro psychologist of the 20th century.</v>

164
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.380
<v Speaker 1>And Andy Goldberg made the case that,</v>

165
00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:34.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

166
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.370
<v Speaker 1>the left hemisphere is specialized for,</v>

167
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:38.743
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

168
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:39.860
<v Speaker 1>for what's known.</v>

169
00:06:39.861 --> 00:06:44.000
<v Speaker 1>And the right hemisphere is specialized for a normally and VSRM a Shondra and</v>

170
00:06:44.001 --> 00:06:45.350
<v Speaker 1>who's a famous neurologist.</v>

171
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:47.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm an MD in,</v>

172
00:06:47.171 --> 00:06:50.930
<v Speaker 1>in California has also made a very similar claim based on his analysis of brain</v>

173
00:06:50.931 --> 00:06:52.430
<v Speaker 1>damaged individuals.</v>

174
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.600
<v Speaker 1>But Goldberg's case was the left hemisphere is specialized for what you know,</v>

175
00:06:56.601 --> 00:06:57.434
<v Speaker 1>how to do.</v>

176
00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:01.490
<v Speaker 1>And the right hemisphere is specialized for response to what's unknown and that</v>

177
00:07:01.491 --> 00:07:04.400
<v Speaker 1>maps on to this order chaos dimension,</v>

178
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:05.720
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

179
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:06.860
<v Speaker 1>and the right hemisphere.</v>

180
00:07:06.861 --> 00:07:07.570
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

181
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:08.390
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

182
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:09.650
<v Speaker 1>McGilchrist in his book,</v>

183
00:07:09.651 --> 00:07:12.680
<v Speaker 1>the master and his emissary has pointed out quite clearly that the left</v>

184
00:07:12.681 --> 00:07:14.690
<v Speaker 1>hemisphere has a tyrannical tendency,</v>

185
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:19.310
<v Speaker 1>which Rameshchandra Shondra and also viewed in his brain damaged patients by the</v>

186
00:07:19.311 --> 00:07:19.760
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

187
00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.640
<v Speaker 1>And that the left hemisphere is always trying to impose.</v>

188
00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.940
<v Speaker 1>It's logical and restricted order on the world.</v>

189
00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:27.860
<v Speaker 1>And to make the world fit into that.</v>

190
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:28.970
<v Speaker 1>Now it has to do that.</v>

191
00:07:28.971 --> 00:07:29.990
<v Speaker 1>There's reasons for that.</v>

192
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:31.670
<v Speaker 1>Part of the reason is,</v>

193
00:07:31.671 --> 00:07:35.480
<v Speaker 1>is that if your theory you've worked on for 10 years makes one prediction error,</v>

194
00:07:35.481 --> 00:07:37.070
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't throw the whole damn thing out.</v>

195
00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:39.290
<v Speaker 1>You should doubt the prediction error,</v>

196
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:39.731
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

197
00:07:39.731 --> 00:07:44.000
<v Speaker 1>Cause you never know when your data is actually data or is just another kind of</v>

198
00:07:44.001 --> 00:07:44.810
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>

199
00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:46.490
<v Speaker 1>We can't get into that at the moment.</v>

200
00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:47.713
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

201
00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:48.673
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

202
00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:53.630
<v Speaker 1>McGilchrist makes it very strong case and I think a more elaborated case than I</v>

203
00:07:53.631 --> 00:07:54.620
<v Speaker 1>made in maps of meaning.</v>

204
00:07:54.621 --> 00:07:59.621
<v Speaker 1>But it's the same argument fundamentally that the right hemisphere is concerned</v>

205
00:07:59.931 --> 00:08:01.540
<v Speaker 1>with reaction to anomaly.</v>

206
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:02.060
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

207
00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:05.390
<v Speaker 1>so what happens in some senses something unexpected happens.</v>

208
00:08:05.391 --> 00:08:06.830
<v Speaker 1>That's the domain of chaos.</v>

209
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:08.900
<v Speaker 1>And that stops you in your tracks,</v>

210
00:08:08.901 --> 00:08:09.621
<v Speaker 1>it freezes you.</v>

211
00:08:09.621 --> 00:08:11.030
<v Speaker 1>And that's a Predator response.</v>

212
00:08:11.031 --> 00:08:11.900
<v Speaker 1>A prey response.</v>

213
00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:12.500
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

214
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:13.333
<v Speaker 1>you're frozen,</v>

215
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:15.260
<v Speaker 1>the unknown has manifested itself.</v>

216
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.090
<v Speaker 1>You're not in order anymore.</v>

217
00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.310
<v Speaker 1>You don't know where you are and you don't know what to do.</v>

218
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:19.821
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

219
00:08:19.821 --> 00:08:21.860
<v Speaker 1>and you can't just shut down like a computer does.</v>

220
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:23.150
<v Speaker 1>You freeze instead.</v>

221
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:27.350
<v Speaker 1>And then what happens is that the ancient mechanisms that have helped our</v>

222
00:08:27.351 --> 00:08:29.540
<v Speaker 1>ancestors for tens of millions of years,</v>

223
00:08:29.541 --> 00:08:31.010
<v Speaker 1>or perhaps longer than that,</v>

224
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:36.310
<v Speaker 1>react to that which looks beyond the confines of the unknown kick in and you</v>

225
00:08:36.561 --> 00:08:36.951
<v Speaker 1>start,</v>

226
00:08:36.951 --> 00:08:37.491
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

227
00:08:37.491 --> 00:08:38.301
<v Speaker 1>that's motoric.</v>

228
00:08:38.301 --> 00:08:42.590
<v Speaker 1>So you freeze and then you cautiously start to explore and then it's imagistic.</v>

229
00:08:42.591 --> 00:08:45.080
<v Speaker 1>You start making imaginal representations,</v>

230
00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:47.000
<v Speaker 1>metaphoric representations,</v>

231
00:08:47.001 --> 00:08:50.330
<v Speaker 1>dramatic representations of what might constitute the unknown.</v>

232
00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:54.950
<v Speaker 1>And then those representations are practiced and implemented in the world.</v>

233
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.840
<v Speaker 1>They become more and more fine grained and automatized.</v>

234
00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:59.160
<v Speaker 1>And as that happens,</v>

235
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:03.270
<v Speaker 1>the locale that they're represented in the brain shifts from right to left.</v>

236
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:04.703
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

237
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:05.761
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

238
00:09:05.761 --> 00:09:09.120
<v Speaker 1>so the reason I'm telling you all this is because you know,</v>

239
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.820
<v Speaker 1>this is where the metaphysical and the physical unite,</v>

240
00:09:11.821 --> 00:09:14.850
<v Speaker 1>and this is the sort of argument that I was trying to make to Sam Harris.</v>

241
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:17.760
<v Speaker 1>And hopefully we'll be able to continue doing that because I'm going to meet him</v>

242
00:09:17.761 --> 00:09:19.230
<v Speaker 1>three times in the next few months.</v>

243
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:21.750
<v Speaker 1>Is that the,</v>

244
00:09:21.751 --> 00:09:22.950
<v Speaker 1>the Yin Yang idea,</v>

245
00:09:22.951 --> 00:09:24.070
<v Speaker 1>the chaos order ideas,</v>

246
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.960
<v Speaker 1>metaphorical in some sense to say that the world is made up of order and chaos</v>

247
00:09:27.961 --> 00:09:29.820
<v Speaker 1>doesn't sound like an empirical statement,</v>

248
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:31.590
<v Speaker 1>but strangely enough,</v>

249
00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:37.010
<v Speaker 1>the world to which our brains are adapted is actually the world of chaos and</v>

250
00:09:37.231 --> 00:09:37.531
<v Speaker 1>order.</v>

251
00:09:37.531 --> 00:09:39.090
<v Speaker 1>You can think about it as unexplored,</v>

252
00:09:39.091 --> 00:09:40.320
<v Speaker 1>unexplored territory too.</v>

253
00:09:40.321 --> 00:09:41.100
<v Speaker 1>That's another,</v>

254
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:41.790
<v Speaker 1>that's another,</v>

255
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:42.623
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

256
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:43.583
<v Speaker 1>take on it.</v>

257
00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:46.740
<v Speaker 1>And so then you think from a Darwinian perspective,</v>

258
00:09:46.741 --> 00:09:47.730
<v Speaker 1>think about it this way.</v>

259
00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:49.980
<v Speaker 1>From a Darwinian perspective,</v>

260
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:50.820
<v Speaker 1>there's an,</v>

261
00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.400
<v Speaker 1>there's an an axiomatic presupposition,</v>

262
00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:56.730
<v Speaker 1>and that is reality is that which selects,</v>

263
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.510
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

264
00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:00.630
<v Speaker 1>reality is the force that selects over evolutionary time.</v>

265
00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:05.160
<v Speaker 1>And so the force that selects over evolutionary time has selected for</v>

266
00:10:05.161 --> 00:10:06.750
<v Speaker 1>hemispheric specialization,</v>

267
00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.910
<v Speaker 1>bilateral hemispheric specialization,</v>

268
00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.960
<v Speaker 1>which indicates the two different modes of looking at the world are necessary</v>

269
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.340
<v Speaker 1>for survival,</v>

270
00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:14.611
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

271
00:10:14.611 --> 00:10:15.660
<v Speaker 1>So that's real.</v>

272
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:19.830
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea that the world is made out of chaos in order is perhaps the most</v>

273
00:10:19.831 --> 00:10:20.700
<v Speaker 1>real idea.</v>

274
00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:21.360
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

275
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.910
<v Speaker 1>here's something else cool that's associated with that.</v>

276
00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:26.400
<v Speaker 1>And this is an antidote to nihilism.</v>

277
00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:29.070
<v Speaker 1>I also think it's an antidote to two.</v>

278
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.390
<v Speaker 1>What would you call 'em?</v>

279
00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:31.680
<v Speaker 1>Ideological,</v>

280
00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.360
<v Speaker 1>ideological possession.</v>

281
00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:37.230
<v Speaker 1>So when you encounter something unknown,</v>

282
00:10:37.231 --> 00:10:40.110
<v Speaker 1>you orient towards it and that's an involuntary response.</v>

283
00:10:40.111 --> 00:10:42.360
<v Speaker 1>You could even think about it as a deterministic response.</v>

284
00:10:42.361 --> 00:10:45.990
<v Speaker 1>It's part of what orients you very rapidly towards predators.</v>

285
00:10:45.991 --> 00:10:48.630
<v Speaker 1>So they don't kill you before you have a chance to respond.</v>

286
00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:49.351
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

287
00:10:49.351 --> 00:10:52.470
<v Speaker 1>so you react because the anomalous thing is meaningful.</v>

288
00:10:52.471 --> 00:10:53.820
<v Speaker 1>It's intrinsically meaningful.</v>

289
00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:59.060
<v Speaker 1>And the reaction is first terror with perhaps an overlay of disgust and second</v>

290
00:10:59.311 --> 00:11:00.180
<v Speaker 1>curiosity.</v>

291
00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:04.020
<v Speaker 1>And it's terrorist so that you freeze and remain paralyzed.</v>

292
00:11:04.021 --> 00:11:05.040
<v Speaker 1>You turn to stone.</v>

293
00:11:05.041 --> 00:11:07.650
<v Speaker 1>When you look at the Bass Lisk or the snake or the Gorgon,</v>

294
00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:08.521
<v Speaker 1>you turned to stone.</v>

295
00:11:08.521 --> 00:11:10.080
<v Speaker 1>You're paralyzed like a prey animal.</v>

296
00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.830
<v Speaker 1>And that's so the prey Predator can't see you at least in part.</v>

297
00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:16.920
<v Speaker 1>And there's other elements of the orienting reflects that are associated with</v>

298
00:11:16.921 --> 00:11:17.880
<v Speaker 1>Predator avoidance.</v>

299
00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:20.100
<v Speaker 1>And then if nothing additionally terrible happens,</v>

300
00:11:20.101 --> 00:11:23.220
<v Speaker 1>you start to thaw out and you start to explore.</v>

301
00:11:23.221 --> 00:11:25.020
<v Speaker 1>And you do that with image first and,</v>

302
00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.080
<v Speaker 1>and then PR and then practice the appropriate behaviors and then,</v>

303
00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:29.160
<v Speaker 1>and then automate those.</v>

304
00:11:29.161 --> 00:11:30.000
<v Speaker 1>Now look,</v>

305
00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:30.871
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing.</v>

306
00:11:30.871 --> 00:11:31.704
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

307
00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:37.280
<v Speaker 1>So that orienting reflects to the unknown is it's an admixture of threat,</v>

308
00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:41.850
<v Speaker 1>fear and curiosity,</v>

309
00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:42.880
<v Speaker 1>incentive reward.</v>

310
00:11:42.881 --> 00:11:47.250
<v Speaker 1>So negative emotion and positive emotion now and it's dose dependent.</v>

311
00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:49.020
<v Speaker 1>The larger the anomaly,</v>

312
00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:51.720
<v Speaker 1>which means the larger the map,</v>

313
00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:54.520
<v Speaker 1>it blows out when it manifests itself.</v>

314
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:59.500
<v Speaker 1>Think of the difference between being irritated at your marital partner because</v>

315
00:11:59.501 --> 00:12:00.040
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

316
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:00.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

317
00:12:00.401 --> 00:12:01.001
<v Speaker 1>um Oh,</v>

318
00:12:01.001 --> 00:12:01.834
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>

319
00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.230
<v Speaker 1>Because they were late to pick you up for work compared to how we rotated you</v>

320
00:12:05.231 --> 00:12:07.390
<v Speaker 1>would be if you found out they were having an affair.</v>

321
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:08.710
<v Speaker 1>Difference in size of a,</v>

322
00:12:08.711 --> 00:12:12.910
<v Speaker 1>normally the first one disrupts a tiny little part of your space,</v>

323
00:12:12.911 --> 00:12:16.750
<v Speaker 1>time orientation and the second one demolishes your past,</v>

324
00:12:16.751 --> 00:12:17.710
<v Speaker 1>present and future.</v>

325
00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:19.630
<v Speaker 1>And the larger the disruption,</v>

326
00:12:19.631 --> 00:12:22.180
<v Speaker 1>the more negative emotion obviously.</v>

327
00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:23.590
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

328
00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:27.520
<v Speaker 1>so there's this weird interplay between negative and positive emotion in the</v>

329
00:12:27.521 --> 00:12:29.480
<v Speaker 1>response to a normally and,</v>

330
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.030
<v Speaker 1>but it's deeply meaningful,</v>

331
00:12:31.031 --> 00:12:33.010
<v Speaker 1>even if it's even if it paralyzes you,</v>

332
00:12:33.011 --> 00:12:34.000
<v Speaker 1>even if it's terrifying,</v>

333
00:12:34.001 --> 00:12:34.834
<v Speaker 1>it's meaningful.</v>

334
00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:38.110
<v Speaker 1>And then that transforms perhaps into intense curiosity and you start to</v>

335
00:12:38.111 --> 00:12:38.890
<v Speaker 1>explore.</v>

336
00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:43.890
<v Speaker 1>Now the phenomena of meaning is a manifestation of the complex orienting reflex.</v>

337
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.980
<v Speaker 1>And so you're wired so that you're not just order and you're not just chaos,</v>

338
00:12:50.981 --> 00:12:55.660
<v Speaker 1>your order continually confronting chaos so that the order remains updated.</v>

339
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:57.250
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>

340
00:12:57.251 --> 00:12:57.431
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

341
00:12:57.431 --> 00:13:01.240
<v Speaker 1>how do you know how much chaos you should confront in order to keep the order</v>

342
00:13:01.241 --> 00:13:02.650
<v Speaker 1>continually updated?</v>

343
00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:08.170
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is maybe see something is meaningful.</v>

344
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.110
<v Speaker 1>The reason that something is meaningful is because you're getting a deep</v>

345
00:13:11.111 --> 00:13:16.111
<v Speaker 1>instinctual signal that you're encountering a normally at a rate that doesn't</v>

346
00:13:16.241 --> 00:13:17.530
<v Speaker 1>exceed your capability.</v>

347
00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:21.430
<v Speaker 1>That's also the rate at which you can keep yourself updated optimally.</v>

348
00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:24.730
<v Speaker 1>And so meaning isn't epit phenomenal and it,</v>

349
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:25.623
<v Speaker 1>and it isn't.</v>

350
00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:30.070
<v Speaker 1>It isn't some kind of delusion that rationality can and should overcome to say,</v>

351
00:13:30.071 --> 00:13:30.251
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

352
00:13:30.251 --> 00:13:31.300
<v Speaker 1>everything's meaningless.</v>

353
00:13:31.301 --> 00:13:31.631
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

354
00:13:31.631 --> 00:13:31.811
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

355
00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:32.410
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

356
00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:35.110
<v Speaker 1>Meaning is the most fundamental instinct for adaptation.</v>

357
00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:37.780
<v Speaker 1>And so that's partly why in 12 rules for life.</v>

358
00:13:37.781 --> 00:13:39.190
<v Speaker 1>I said one of the rules,</v>

359
00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:43.150
<v Speaker 1>I think it's rule seven is do what is meaningful,</v>

360
00:13:43.151 --> 00:13:47.160
<v Speaker 1>not what is expedient because meaning is a really good guide to longterm</v>

361
00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:48.063
<v Speaker 1>adaptation.</v>

362
00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:49.140
<v Speaker 1>And so then,</v>

363
00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:50.620
<v Speaker 1>and the other thing about meaning,</v>

364
00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:53.980
<v Speaker 1>which is what happens when you get the balance between chaos and order,</v>

365
00:13:53.981 --> 00:13:54.191
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

366
00:13:54.191 --> 00:13:57.250
<v Speaker 1>Is that meaning is the antidote to despair.</v>

367
00:13:57.850 --> 00:13:59.320
<v Speaker 1>And so if you,</v>

368
00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:01.960
<v Speaker 1>and there's all sorts of reasons in life to be desperate.</v>

369
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:04.540
<v Speaker 1>And so if you immerse yourself in meaning,</v>

370
00:14:04.541 --> 00:14:05.650
<v Speaker 1>you can learn to do that.</v>

371
00:14:05.651 --> 00:14:06.700
<v Speaker 1>You can learn to do that.</v>

372
00:14:06.701 --> 00:14:08.740
<v Speaker 1>You can make that goal your highest goal.</v>

373
00:14:08.741 --> 00:14:13.330
<v Speaker 1>And so then the highest goal would be to be the sort of mythological hero,</v>

374
00:14:13.331 --> 00:14:13.811
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

375
00:14:13.811 --> 00:14:18.640
<v Speaker 1>to embody and incarnate and imitate the mythological hero,</v>

376
00:14:18.641 --> 00:14:19.900
<v Speaker 1>like the imitation of Christ,</v>

377
00:14:19.901 --> 00:14:21.550
<v Speaker 1>which is what you're called to do.</v>

378
00:14:21.551 --> 00:14:22.930
<v Speaker 1>If you happen to be Christian,</v>

379
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:25.420
<v Speaker 1>that means that you live in meaning.</v>

380
00:14:25.421 --> 00:14:28.660
<v Speaker 1>And that meaning is the antidote to the suffering of life that would otherwise</v>

381
00:14:28.661 --> 00:14:32.110
<v Speaker 1>make you brutal and vengeful and unhappy and miserable.</v>

382
00:14:32.111 --> 00:14:32.980
<v Speaker 1>And like that,</v>

383
00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:37.270
<v Speaker 1>that young guy who just mowed down 12 people in Toronto,</v>

384
00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:38.890
<v Speaker 1>these are real things.</v>

385
00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.390
<v Speaker 1>You lose your sense of meaning.</v>

386
00:14:40.391 --> 00:14:42.420
<v Speaker 1>You end up in hell and inhale,</v>

387
00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:44.410
<v Speaker 1>you do all sorts of terrible things.</v>

388
00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:45.191
<v Speaker 1>These are,</v>

389
00:14:45.191 --> 00:14:49.840
<v Speaker 1>these are dreadful realities and it isn't as if they're not grounded in the</v>

390
00:14:49.841 --> 00:14:51.010
<v Speaker 1>appropriate science.</v>
