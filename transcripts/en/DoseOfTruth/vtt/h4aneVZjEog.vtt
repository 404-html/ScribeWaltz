1
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.750
<v Speaker 1>Agreeable young woman to be more disagreeable and assertive if that isn't how</v>

2
00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:14.980
<v Speaker 1>she is temperamentally inclined.</v>

3
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:15.641
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4
00:00:15.641 --> 00:00:16.480
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>

5
00:00:16.481 --> 00:00:17.710
<v Speaker 1>And I would say first of all,</v>

6
00:00:17.711 --> 00:00:22.711
<v Speaker 1>that's a very common question that people who go into psychotherapy ask.</v>

7
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.050
<v Speaker 1>I think the most common problem that psychotherapists deal with apart from</v>

8
00:00:28.751 --> 00:00:32.140
<v Speaker 1>anxiety and depression is probably assertiveness training.</v>

9
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:33.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

10
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.720
<v Speaker 1>so the first thing I would say is you really need to figure out what you want.</v>

11
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.560
<v Speaker 1>And I would recommend doing the self authoring program,</v>

12
00:00:41.561 --> 00:00:44.740
<v Speaker 1>the future authoring program in particular because if you want to stand up for</v>

13
00:00:44.741 --> 00:00:45.520
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

14
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.520
<v Speaker 1>you have to have your goals and your vision well laid out and well defined.</v>

15
00:00:51.011 --> 00:00:52.870
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to have a strategy,</v>

16
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.800
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

17
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.430
<v Speaker 1>that that is matched to those goals so that you can,</v>

18
00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.270
<v Speaker 1>so that you know what you want so that you know when you're not getting it it</v>

19
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.550
<v Speaker 1>otherwise you're left with a vague sense of dissatisfaction and resentment.</v>

20
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:07.121
<v Speaker 1>And that's very,</v>

21
00:01:07.121 --> 00:01:08.770
<v Speaker 1>very difficult thing to articulate.</v>

22
00:01:08.771 --> 00:01:10.450
<v Speaker 1>And if you can't articulate it,</v>

23
00:01:10.451 --> 00:01:11.710
<v Speaker 1>then you can't negotiate.</v>

24
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.230
<v Speaker 1>If you know what you want and you know why,</v>

25
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.240
<v Speaker 1>then you can make a case for yourself.</v>

26
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.601
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

27
00:01:16.601 --> 00:01:20.500
<v Speaker 1>So let's assume now that you've laid out a vision and a counter vision,</v>

28
00:01:20.501 --> 00:01:22.750
<v Speaker 1>which the future authoring program also helps you do.</v>

29
00:01:22.751 --> 00:01:26.710
<v Speaker 1>So you know what kind of hell you want to avoid that you might drift into if you</v>

30
00:01:26.711 --> 00:01:28.600
<v Speaker 1>were to agreeable for the rest of your life.</v>

31
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.410
<v Speaker 1>And that would be a hell that consisted mostly of people taking advantage of you</v>

32
00:01:32.411 --> 00:01:34.810
<v Speaker 1>all the time and you feeling resentful and bitter about it.</v>

33
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.550
<v Speaker 1>Not something I would recommend.</v>

34
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.570
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

35
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.841
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

36
00:01:37.841 --> 00:01:42.841
<v Speaker 1>I think that women are agreeable because it helps them deal with infants,</v>

37
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.300
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a great temperamental strategy for dealing with complex,</v>

38
00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:49.743
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

39
00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.100
<v Speaker 1>organizations in,</v>

40
00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.330
<v Speaker 1>in the adult world.</v>

41
00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.130
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's a price that women pay for.</v>

42
00:01:54.131 --> 00:01:58.360
<v Speaker 1>Also being adapted to have plenty of patients for very young children.</v>

43
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.400
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to overcome that to some degree to put yourself forward</v>

44
00:02:03.401 --> 00:02:06.940
<v Speaker 1>properly in more complex hierarchies of accomplishment.</v>

45
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.080
<v Speaker 1>So I would say once you have your vision established,</v>

46
00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.120
<v Speaker 1>your vision for the future and your counter vision,</v>

47
00:02:13.121 --> 00:02:14.590
<v Speaker 1>so you're afraid of what will happen.</v>

48
00:02:14.591 --> 00:02:16.030
<v Speaker 1>If you don't stand up for yourself,</v>

49
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.120
<v Speaker 1>then you need to consult your resentment fic.</v>

50
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.980
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're resentful about something,</v>

51
00:02:20.981 --> 00:02:21.940
<v Speaker 1>as far as I can tell,</v>

52
00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:23.620
<v Speaker 1>there's generally only two reasons.</v>

53
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.800
<v Speaker 1>One is you should grow the hell up and quit whining,</v>

54
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.180
<v Speaker 1>so you've got to find out first.</v>

55
00:02:28.181 --> 00:02:31.600
<v Speaker 1>If you're just feeling sorry for yourself and you can think that through,</v>

56
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.200
<v Speaker 1>make a pro and con case and you can talk to somebody that you care about about</v>

57
00:02:35.201 --> 00:02:35.590
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

58
00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm not assuming that that's the reason,</v>

59
00:02:37.751 --> 00:02:39.130
<v Speaker 1>but that's one potential reason.</v>

60
00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.160
<v Speaker 1>If you're not merely feeling sorry for yourself,</v>

61
00:02:42.161 --> 00:02:46.030
<v Speaker 1>then you probably have something to say and something that you need and you need</v>

62
00:02:46.031 --> 00:02:49.660
<v Speaker 1>to figure out what that is and then you have to develop a strategy to to put</v>

63
00:02:49.661 --> 00:02:50.494
<v Speaker 1>that forward.</v>

64
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.740
<v Speaker 1>I've seen lots of people in my personal life and in my private practice not get</v>

65
00:02:56.411 --> 00:02:57.820
<v Speaker 1>what they want because well a,</v>

66
00:02:57.821 --> 00:03:00.640
<v Speaker 1>they don't specify it and they don't ask for it.</v>

67
00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:05.350
<v Speaker 1>And if you're negotiating save for a raise or for a promotion and so forth,</v>

68
00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:06.760
<v Speaker 1>you have to put yourself forward.</v>

69
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:09.400
<v Speaker 1>You need to tell your the person you're working for,</v>

70
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.640
<v Speaker 1>why you should be treated with more consideration or respect or have more</v>

71
00:03:14.831 --> 00:03:17.260
<v Speaker 1>resources devoted to you or more authority.</v>

72
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

73
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.510
<v Speaker 1>what shifted to you?</v>

74
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.650
<v Speaker 1>And you have to make a case for that.</v>

75
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.090
<v Speaker 1>A compelling case so that they have a reason to attend to you.</v>

76
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.160
<v Speaker 1>And that's not good.</v>

77
00:03:27.161 --> 00:03:30.880
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to notice because most managerial types are so overloaded with</v>

78
00:03:30.881 --> 00:03:33.550
<v Speaker 1>work that they never noticed when anything's going right.</v>

79
00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.310
<v Speaker 1>They just notice the things that are going wrong.</v>

80
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.200
<v Speaker 1>So you need to make a plan,</v>

81
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.200
<v Speaker 1>you have to have a strategy that goes along with that plan.</v>

82
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.380
<v Speaker 1>You have to have articulated arguments for why certain a certain form of</v>

83
00:03:46.511 --> 00:03:48.640
<v Speaker 1>treatment is appropriate to you.</v>

84
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.670
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to have the courage to put that forward.</v>

85
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.130
<v Speaker 1>And I guess you have to remember that you owe yourself as much as you owe other</v>

86
00:03:57.131 --> 00:03:57.730
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

87
00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:58.960
<v Speaker 1>You have to take care of yourself,</v>

88
00:03:58.961 --> 00:04:01.240
<v Speaker 1>like you take care of other people and,</v>

89
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.000
<v Speaker 1>and that's a moral duty and if you practice that,</v>

90
00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:04.834
<v Speaker 1>you can do it.</v>

91
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.913
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of that,</v>

92
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.560
<v Speaker 1>a lot of that is also associated with telling the truth.</v>

93
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.831
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

94
00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:10.690
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a better friend than the truth,</v>

95
00:04:10.691 --> 00:04:12.640
<v Speaker 1>even though it can be very harsh in the short term.</v>

96
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.900
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're unhappy at work because you're being taken advantage of,</v>

97
00:04:16.901 --> 00:04:19.510
<v Speaker 1>then you have to strategize yourself out of that and you have to learn to</v>

98
00:04:19.511 --> 00:04:20.344
<v Speaker 1>negotiate.</v>

99
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.850
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of that also means that you have to overcome your hesitancy to engage</v>

100
00:04:24.851 --> 00:04:25.684
<v Speaker 1>in conflict.</v>

101
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.340
<v Speaker 1>And you've got to think about it this way.</v>

102
00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.050
<v Speaker 1>Negotiation and conflict are somewhat indistinguishable and it's easy moment to</v>

103
00:04:35.801 --> 00:04:37.900
<v Speaker 1>moment to avoid negotiation conflict,</v>

104
00:04:37.901 --> 00:04:40.600
<v Speaker 1>but you pay a terrible price for it in the medium to long term.</v>

105
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.690
<v Speaker 1>It's better to face the conflict forthrightly in the present and make peace for</v>

106
00:04:46.631 --> 00:04:47.770
<v Speaker 1>the medium to long term.</v>

107
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.450
<v Speaker 1>And that there's courage in that.</v>

108
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.560
<v Speaker 1>So that's the other thing I would say is gird up your loins and,</v>

109
00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:54.430
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

110
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:55.240
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

111
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.690
<v Speaker 1>and allow yourself to act courageously,</v>

112
00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.680
<v Speaker 1>courageously.</v>

113
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.513
<v Speaker 1>And truthfully,</v>

114
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.950
<v Speaker 1>truth is your best bet if you're too agreeable.</v>

115
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.210
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

116
00:05:04.211 --> 00:05:06.850
<v Speaker 1>you also might find that you have a pretty good critical intelligence,</v>

117
00:05:06.851 --> 00:05:09.750
<v Speaker 1>but that you think it's mean and so that you keep it hidden.</v>

118
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.920
<v Speaker 1>Some of the smartest women I knew who were very,</v>

119
00:05:11.921 --> 00:05:16.900
<v Speaker 1>very agreeable had unbelievably good instincts with regards to figuring out what</v>

120
00:05:16.901 --> 00:05:18.250
<v Speaker 1>other people's motives were,</v>

121
00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:21.040
<v Speaker 1>but they were ashamed of their suspicions.</v>

122
00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.280
<v Speaker 1>And really what that meant was they ended up being ashamed of their critical</v>

123
00:05:24.281 --> 00:05:26.230
<v Speaker 1>intelligence because they were so agreeable.</v>

124
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.350
<v Speaker 1>So it may be that the darker part of you,</v>

125
00:05:29.351 --> 00:05:32.590
<v Speaker 1>the shadow part of you knows things that you could know if you are willing to</v>

126
00:05:32.591 --> 00:05:33.700
<v Speaker 1>admit that they were true.</v>

127
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.670
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to give some credence to your,</v>

128
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:38.860
<v Speaker 1>to your darker element,</v>

129
00:05:38.861 --> 00:05:39.694
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

130
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.610
<v Speaker 1>How do you know if you were communicating with the actual person or a mask?</v>

131
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.460
<v Speaker 1>I sometimes wonder if I can ever really know someone.</v>

132
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:02.773
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

133
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.800
<v Speaker 1>you can't ever thoroughly know someone because people are too complicated.</v>

134
00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:08.660
<v Speaker 1>You can't even really know yourself.</v>

135
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.020
<v Speaker 1>How do you know if you're communicating with the actual person or a mask?</v>

136
00:06:12.021 --> 00:06:12.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

137
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.780
<v Speaker 1>if you're communicating with an actual person,</v>

138
00:06:14.781 --> 00:06:16.730
<v Speaker 1>then you're actually having a conversation,</v>

139
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.481
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

140
00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:22.100
<v Speaker 1>and the conversation transforms as a consequence of participating in it and it</v>

141
00:06:22.101 --> 00:06:24.200
<v Speaker 1>tends to be engaging in meaningful.</v>

142
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.300
<v Speaker 1>If what's happening is an exchange of ideological platitudes or or just</v>

143
00:06:29.301 --> 00:06:31.460
<v Speaker 1>platitudes themselves for that matter,</v>

144
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.800
<v Speaker 1>then you probably engaging with the mask.</v>

145
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:39.050
<v Speaker 1>So if the conversation is compelling and meaningful and it transforms as it as</v>

146
00:06:39.051 --> 00:06:43.550
<v Speaker 1>it progresses and and you can see that give and take that dance like give and</v>

147
00:06:43.551 --> 00:06:43.881
<v Speaker 1>take,</v>

148
00:06:43.881 --> 00:06:46.310
<v Speaker 1>then you're communicating with an actual person.</v>

149
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.210
<v Speaker 1>The other thing I would say is that when you're communicating with an actual</v>

150
00:06:50.211 --> 00:06:51.620
<v Speaker 1>person rather than a mask,</v>

151
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.760
<v Speaker 1>that person that you're communicating with tends to be quite interesting.</v>

152
00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:56.601
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

153
00:06:56.601 --> 00:06:58.670
<v Speaker 1>if people talk about what they know,</v>

154
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:00.740
<v Speaker 1>which means you really communicating with them.</v>

155
00:07:00.741 --> 00:07:05.741
<v Speaker 1>If they talk about their own personal experience instead of wandering off into</v>

156
00:07:05.811 --> 00:07:09.050
<v Speaker 1>the domain of cliches and ideological platitudes,</v>

157
00:07:09.051 --> 00:07:11.810
<v Speaker 1>then people tend to be extraordinarily interesting.</v>

158
00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:17.260
<v Speaker 1>And so that's another good tactic and a good hint that you're,</v>

159
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.340
<v Speaker 1>that you're where you should be when you're conversing.</v>

160
00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:24.760
<v Speaker 1>One of the rules I had when I was seeing clients actively was that if the</v>

161
00:07:25.251 --> 00:07:27.740
<v Speaker 1>conversation I was having wasn't interesting,</v>

162
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.630
<v Speaker 1>and if my attention started to wonder,</v>

163
00:07:29.631 --> 00:07:34.340
<v Speaker 1>then we weren't discussing issues that were sufficiently vital because if we</v>

164
00:07:34.341 --> 00:07:35.990
<v Speaker 1>were discussing vital issues,</v>

165
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.140
<v Speaker 1>then the conversation basically flew by,</v>

166
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.820
<v Speaker 1>and so I think that's a good,</v>

167
00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.020
<v Speaker 1>that's a good marker.</v>
