00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.580
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that people are very much confused by in the modern world is</v>

2
00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.150
<v Speaker 1>what our tech people meant by Gods.</v>

3
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.250
<v Speaker 1>And that's because whatever the day these were that had the motive force,</v>

4
00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:21.550
<v Speaker 1>that archaic people attributed to the Gods seemed to have disappeared in modern</v>

5
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:22.803
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

6
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.620
<v Speaker 1>Now the young end hypothesis is that's because they turned into psychological</v>

7
00:00:26.621 --> 00:00:29.710
<v Speaker 1>traits fundamentally or motivational forces.</v>

8
00:00:29.711 --> 00:00:30.820
<v Speaker 1>So what the,</v>

9
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.700
<v Speaker 1>what archaic societies would describe as Gods,</v>

10
00:00:33.701 --> 00:00:35.770
<v Speaker 1>we would describe as motivational forces.</v>

11
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.000
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

12
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.680
<v Speaker 1>Venus is a goddess,</v>

13
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:39.521
<v Speaker 1>the goddess of love,</v>

14
00:00:39.521 --> 00:00:44.521
<v Speaker 1>and we would associate her power with love and sex fundamentally.</v>

15
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.280
<v Speaker 1>And the reason that that's an reasonable association from the archaic standpoint</v>

16
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.650
<v Speaker 1>is because the motive quality that makes up what Venus represents is</v>

17
00:00:55.961 --> 00:00:56.890
<v Speaker 1>transpersonal,</v>

18
00:00:56.891 --> 00:01:01.891
<v Speaker 1>which means it's not limited to one person and it's immortal in that the motive</v>

19
00:01:03.491 --> 00:01:06.400
<v Speaker 1>force that characterizes sexual affiliation exists,</v>

20
00:01:06.401 --> 00:01:08.740
<v Speaker 1>whether or not a single individual exists.</v>

21
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.300
<v Speaker 1>So it's transpersonal has the force of a personality because if you fall in</v>

22
00:01:13.301 --> 00:01:14.134
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>

23
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.400
<v Speaker 1>you're motivated by a certain set of standards and perspectives,</v>

24
00:01:18.401 --> 00:01:18.611
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

25
00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:20.260
<v Speaker 1>If you're gripped by beauty,</v>

26
00:01:20.261 --> 00:01:25.261
<v Speaker 1>say or if you're gripped by lust that imposes a particular view of the world on</v>

27
00:01:26.501 --> 00:01:30.490
<v Speaker 1>you and impels your action sometimes despite your will and so that would be</v>

28
00:01:30.491 --> 00:01:34.990
<v Speaker 1>equivalent from the archaic perspective to possession and it's clearly the case</v>

29
00:01:34.991 --> 00:01:38.110
<v Speaker 1>that archaic societies who are engaged in warfare for example,</v>

30
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.850
<v Speaker 1>would conduct rituals to ensure that the warriors that made up their societies</v>

31
00:01:42.851 --> 00:01:45.220
<v Speaker 1>were in fact possessed by the correct God.</v>

32
00:01:45.221 --> 00:01:49.330
<v Speaker 1>So it might be Mars for example the Roman God of war so that on the battlefield</v>

33
00:01:49.331 --> 00:01:53.080
<v Speaker 1>they exhibited the proper characteristics of somebody who was in a battle,</v>

34
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.530
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

35
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:54.220
<v Speaker 1>rage,</v>

36
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.450
<v Speaker 1>you can think rage,</v>

37
00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.190
<v Speaker 1>so possession by the god of war would be equivalent to this possession by state</v>

38
00:02:00.191 --> 00:02:00.580
<v Speaker 1>of rage.</v>

39
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.410
<v Speaker 1>Now it's not quite that simple.</v>

40
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.390
<v Speaker 1>It isn't only that archaic people externalized motive forces and gave them the</v>

41
00:02:07.391 --> 00:02:08.470
<v Speaker 1>status of Daddy's.</v>

42
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.420
<v Speaker 1>What they did was more complex than not.</v>

43
00:02:10.421 --> 00:02:13.090
<v Speaker 1>And I think you can understand that a little bit better if you start to,</v>

44
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.130
<v Speaker 1>if you start to give some thought to the modern behavioral notion of the</v>

45
00:02:18.131 --> 00:02:20.410
<v Speaker 1>stimulus and the stimulus is a very,</v>

46
00:02:20.411 --> 00:02:24.850
<v Speaker 1>very weird concept because the behavior is who weren't interested in taking</v>

47
00:02:24.851 --> 00:02:29.200
<v Speaker 1>apart what was inside the brain would attribute motive force to the stimulus,</v>

48
00:02:29.201 --> 00:02:29.471
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

49
00:02:29.471 --> 00:02:31.570
<v Speaker 1>They'd say if you present an animal with the stimulus,</v>

50
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.370
<v Speaker 1>he will therefore act.</v>

51
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.730
<v Speaker 1>And that meant that their behaviors were making the presupposition that the</v>

52
00:02:36.731 --> 00:02:40.930
<v Speaker 1>motive power resided in some manner in the stimulus.</v>

53
00:02:40.931 --> 00:02:41.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

54
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.681
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

55
00:02:41.681 --> 00:02:42.970
<v Speaker 1>why would they think like that?</v>

56
00:02:42.971 --> 00:02:43.151
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

57
00:02:43.151 --> 00:02:45.220
<v Speaker 1>it's an archaic mode of thought in a sense.</v>

58
00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.410
<v Speaker 1>You could imagine a child saying,</v>

59
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.273
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

60
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.670
<v Speaker 1>one of my friends today made me really angry.</v>

61
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:52.001
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

62
00:02:52.001 --> 00:02:56.410
<v Speaker 1>Which means that the child is essentially conflating his or her own internal</v>

63
00:02:56.411 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>emotional state with the proximal stimulus that rise to that state.</v>

64
00:03:00.071 --> 00:03:04.330
<v Speaker 1>And you see complex associations like that taking place with regards to the</v>

65
00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:05.380
<v Speaker 1>apprehension of beauty.</v>

66
00:03:05.381 --> 00:03:05.621
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>

67
00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:06.610
<v Speaker 1>because beauty is a very,</v>

68
00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:09.610
<v Speaker 1>very complex and difficult to localize phenomena.</v>

69
00:03:09.611 --> 00:03:11.620
<v Speaker 1>If you're very attracted to someone,</v>

70
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.110
<v Speaker 1>are you attracted by them?</v>

71
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.501
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

72
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:15.041
<v Speaker 1>in a sense,</v>

73
00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:16.560
<v Speaker 1>of course you are because they are the art.</v>

74
00:03:16.561 --> 00:03:17.980
<v Speaker 1>But in another sense you're not at all.</v>

75
00:03:17.981 --> 00:03:22.981
<v Speaker 1>Because what's happening is that you're engaged as much in the attraction as</v>

76
00:03:23.201 --> 00:03:25.960
<v Speaker 1>anything that's motivating you from the outside world.</v>

77
00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:29.200
<v Speaker 1>And I think that partly accounts for your sense of foolishness,</v>

78
00:03:29.201 --> 00:03:32.470
<v Speaker 1>especially if the person that you're attracted to doesn't return your</v>

79
00:03:32.471 --> 00:03:33.130
<v Speaker 1>attraction.</v>

80
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.963
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

81
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.710
<v Speaker 1>you know that from your perceptual perspective,</v>

82
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:41.200
<v Speaker 1>you're attracted and dominated by the object.</v>

83
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:42.430
<v Speaker 1>But by the same token,</v>

84
00:03:42.431 --> 00:03:47.230
<v Speaker 1>you know entirely that easy as it is to presume it's them and their faults say</v>

85
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.480
<v Speaker 1>pretty much it all has to do with you.</v>

86
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.750
<v Speaker 1>So in the modern world where we've been able to separate out the object and the</v>

87
00:03:54.761 --> 00:03:56.320
<v Speaker 1>motive force of the object,</v>

88
00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.010
<v Speaker 1>the day of these have sort of moved inside of us and becomes psychological</v>

89
00:04:00.011 --> 00:04:00.551
<v Speaker 1>forces.</v>

90
00:04:00.551 --> 00:04:03.430
<v Speaker 1>But you can understand if you think about it in this manner that things weren't</v>

91
00:04:03.431 --> 00:04:06.370
<v Speaker 1>so clear prior to the dawn of the empirical age.</v>

92
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.850
<v Speaker 1>That gives you a little bit of background with regards to what the notion of</v>

93
00:04:15.851 --> 00:04:20.851
<v Speaker 1>Daddy meant to archaic societies who still utilize those notions as ex</v>

94
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.080
<v Speaker 1>explanatory terms.</v>
