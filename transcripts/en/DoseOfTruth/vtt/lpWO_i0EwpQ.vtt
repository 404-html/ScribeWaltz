1
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.920
Nothing motivates me aside to meeting a sleeping.

2
00:00:09.921 --> 00:00:11.300
I lie in my bed all day.

3
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.470
No one of my computer,

4
00:00:12.471 --> 00:00:13.251
not on my phone,

5
00:00:13.251 --> 00:00:14.090
not doing anything.

6
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.730
I just lie there thinking what's happening to me.

7
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.100
I would say that you are,

8
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.330
this is not a diagnostic comment and I don't know enough about you to provide

9
00:00:23.331 --> 00:00:24.410
that sort of information,

10
00:00:24.411 --> 00:00:29.411
but I would recommend that you see a therapist and be screened for depression

11
00:00:29.841 --> 00:00:31.370
because that's what it looks like to me.

12
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.010
And I would say that if it's depression,

13
00:00:34.011 --> 00:00:37.370
you should do something about it because depression is very hard on people.

14
00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:41.790
If produces a lot of stress hormones like cortisol and that can hurt you,

15
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.290
may,

16
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.621
you know it's,

17
00:00:42.621 --> 00:00:43.850
it's only been a couple of days,

18
00:00:43.851 --> 00:00:44.810
I wouldn't worry about it.

19
00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:48.020
But if it's a chronic powder then you should go talk to somebody.

20
00:00:48.021 --> 00:00:49.310
Even your family doctor,

21
00:00:49.311 --> 00:00:49.581
you know,

22
00:00:49.581 --> 00:00:53.540
and there's always the possibility that a low dose of an antidepressant might be

23
00:00:53.541 --> 00:00:54.320
worth trying.

24
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.030
You'd know in a month if it fixed you.

25
00:00:56.031 --> 00:00:57.440
But I would say don't,

26
00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.330
don't stay in that situation now.

27
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:00.230
Go,

28
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.070
go find out,

29
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.350
do whatever you have to do.

30
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.193
To get out of it.

31
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.700
And especially the fact that you're not on your computer,

32
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:06.531
not on your phone,

33
00:01:06.531 --> 00:01:07.430
not doing anything.

34
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.701
You know,

35
00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:08.120
you're,

36
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.020
you're ruminating that's just lying there thinking about Snoop's of negative

37
00:01:12.021 --> 00:01:12.511
emotion.

38
00:01:12.511 --> 00:01:14.570
And you don't have any positive emotion,

39
00:01:14.571 --> 00:01:15.020
you know,

40
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.150
that's why you're not on your computer or your phone.

41
00:01:17.151 --> 00:01:20.390
And so one of the characteristics of depression,

42
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.230
while I suppose two of the characteristics is a decrease in positive motivation.

43
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.770
And so that means that you're not interested in anything and an increase in

44
00:01:27.771 --> 00:01:28.581
negative emotion.

45
00:01:28.581 --> 00:01:30.320
And that can manifest itself in that.

46
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.720
I'm just lying there thinking,

47
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:33.583
you know,

48
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:34.483
so,

49
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:35.210
um,

50
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.230
go talk to someone,

51
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.460
go talk to someone,

52
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.200
tell someone that this is happening.

53
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.880
Get to your family doctor,

54
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.320
let them know what's happening.

55
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.500
Get them to give you a depression screening and uh,

56
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.060
and see what you can do about it.

57
00:01:47.061 --> 00:01:51.110
Because there are effective treatments for depression and sometimes

58
00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:54.230
antidepressants work like a absolute charm.
