1
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:02.580
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to figure out</v>

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.660
<v Speaker 1>who I was and how that could be fixed.</v>

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:07.710
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>

4
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.060
<v Speaker 1>I started to pay very careful attention to what I was saying.</v>

5
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that happened voluntarily or involuntarily,</v>

6
00:00:15.301 --> 00:00:19.290
<v Speaker 1>but I could feel it sort of split developing in my psyche and the split.</v>

7
00:00:19.291 --> 00:00:23.190
<v Speaker 1>And I've actually had students tell me the same thing has happened to them after</v>

8
00:00:23.191 --> 00:00:27.780
<v Speaker 1>they've listened to some of the material that that I've been describing to all</v>

9
00:00:27.781 --> 00:00:28.614
<v Speaker 1>of you,</v>

10
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.970
<v Speaker 1>but split into two let's say.</v>

11
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.080
<v Speaker 1>And one part was the,</v>

12
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.340
<v Speaker 1>let's say the old me that was talking a lot and that liked to argue and that</v>

13
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.420
<v Speaker 1>liked ideas.</v>

14
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.540
<v Speaker 1>And there was another part that was watching that part,</v>

15
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.800
<v Speaker 1>like just with it's eyes open and neutrally judging.</v>

16
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.360
<v Speaker 1>And the part that was neutrally judging was watching the part that was talking</v>

17
00:00:54.361 --> 00:00:55.194
<v Speaker 1>and going,</v>

18
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.790
<v Speaker 1>that isn't your idea.</v>

19
00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.220
<v Speaker 1>You don't really believe that.</v>

20
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.530
<v Speaker 1>You don't really know what you're talking about.</v>

21
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.150
<v Speaker 1>That isn't true.</v>

22
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.470
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

23
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.770
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>

24
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:05.730
<v Speaker 1>that's really interesting.</v>

25
00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:06.220
<v Speaker 1>So now I've,</v>

26
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.850
<v Speaker 1>and that was happening to like 95% of what I was saying.</v>

27
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.500
<v Speaker 1>And so then I didn't really know what to do.</v>

28
00:01:10.501 --> 00:01:10.831
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

29
00:01:10.831 --> 00:01:11.161
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

30
00:01:11.161 --> 00:01:11.911
<v Speaker 1>this is strange,</v>

31
00:01:11.911 --> 00:01:12.970
<v Speaker 1>so maybe I've,</v>

32
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.660
<v Speaker 1>I've fragmented and that's just not a good thing at all.</v>

33
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

34
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.780
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't like it was hearing voices or anything like that.</v>

35
00:01:18.781 --> 00:01:19.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

36
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.100
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't like that.</v>

37
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.661
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

38
00:01:21.661 --> 00:01:22.494
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

39
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.711
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

40
00:01:22.711 --> 00:01:24.810
<v Speaker 1>people have multiple parts.</v>

41
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.450
<v Speaker 1>So then I had this weird conundrum.</v>

42
00:01:27.451 --> 00:01:28.284
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

43
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.531
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

44
00:01:28.531 --> 00:01:30.390
<v Speaker 1>which of this two things are me?</v>

45
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.240
<v Speaker 1>Is it the part that's listening and saying,</v>

46
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.990
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

47
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.220
<v Speaker 1>that's rubbish.</v>

48
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.240
<v Speaker 1>That's a lie.</v>

49
00:01:36.241 --> 00:01:39.000
<v Speaker 1>That's you're doing that to impress people.</v>

50
00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:40.410
<v Speaker 1>You're just trying to win the argument,</v>

51
00:01:40.411 --> 00:01:41.244
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

52
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.750
<v Speaker 1>was that me or was the part that was going about my normal verbal business?</v>

53
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.460
<v Speaker 1>Me and I didn't know,</v>

54
00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:51.540
<v Speaker 1>but I decided I would go with the critic and then what I tried to do,</v>

55
00:01:51.541 --> 00:01:52.440
<v Speaker 1>what I learned to do,</v>

56
00:01:52.441 --> 00:01:56.520
<v Speaker 1>I think was to stop saying things that made me weak.</v>

57
00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:58.800
<v Speaker 1>And now that,</v>

58
00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:59.131
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

59
00:01:59.131 --> 00:02:03.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm still trying to do that because I'm always feeling when I talk,</v>

60
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.190
<v Speaker 1>whether or not the words that I'm saying are either making me align or making me</v>

61
00:02:08.191 --> 00:02:09.024
<v Speaker 1>come apart.</v>

62
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.860
<v Speaker 1>And I think the alignment,</v>

63
00:02:10.861 --> 00:02:12.720
<v Speaker 1>I really do think the alignment is,</v>

64
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.060
<v Speaker 1>I think alignment is the right way of conceptualizing it.</v>

65
00:02:15.061 --> 00:02:18.510
<v Speaker 1>Because I think if you say things that are as true is,</v>

66
00:02:18.511 --> 00:02:19.350
<v Speaker 1>you can say them.</v>

67
00:02:19.351 --> 00:02:20.184
<v Speaker 1>Let's say.</v>

68
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.590
<v Speaker 1>Then they come up,</v>

69
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.610
<v Speaker 1>they come out of the depths inside of you because we don't know where thoughts</v>

70
00:02:26.611 --> 00:02:27.240
<v Speaker 1>come from.</v>

71
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.110
<v Speaker 1>We don't know how far down into your substructure,</v>

72
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.020
<v Speaker 1>the thoughts emerge.</v>

73
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.400
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what processes of physiological alignment are necessary for you to</v>

74
00:02:35.401 --> 00:02:37.440
<v Speaker 1>speak from the core of your being.</v>

75
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.790
<v Speaker 1>We don't understand any of that.</v>

76
00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:40.110
<v Speaker 1>We don't even conceptualize that.</v>

77
00:02:40.111 --> 00:02:41.520
<v Speaker 1>But I believe that you can feel that.</v>

78
00:02:41.521 --> 00:02:43.680
<v Speaker 1>And I learned some of that from reading Carl Rogers,</v>

79
00:02:43.681 --> 00:02:44.071
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

80
00:02:44.071 --> 00:02:45.150
<v Speaker 1>who's a great clinician,</v>

81
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

82
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.820
<v Speaker 1>because he talked about mental health in part as a coherence between the,</v>

83
00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.610
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

84
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.260
<v Speaker 1>the spiritual or the,</v>

85
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.380
<v Speaker 1>or the abstract and the physical that the two things were aligned.</v>

86
00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of idea of alignment in psychoanalytic and clinical thinking.</v>

87
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:01.361
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

88
00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:04.450
<v Speaker 1>I decided that I would start practicing,</v>

89
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.970
<v Speaker 1>not saying things that would make me weak.</v>

90
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.380
<v Speaker 1>And what happened was that I had to stop saying almost everything that I was</v>

91
00:03:11.381 --> 00:03:12.214
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

92
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.820
<v Speaker 1>I would say 95% of it as a hell of a shock to wake up.</v>

93
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.770
<v Speaker 1>And I mean this was over a few months,</v>

94
00:03:17.771 --> 00:03:22.540
<v Speaker 1>but it's a hell of a shark to wake up and realize that you're mostly dead wood.</v>

95
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.670
<v Speaker 1>It's a shock,</v>

96
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.391
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

97
00:03:25.391 --> 00:03:26.021
<v Speaker 1>And you might think,</v>

98
00:03:26.021 --> 00:03:26.171
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

99
00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:27.850
<v Speaker 1>do you really want all of that to burn off?</v>

100
00:03:27.851 --> 00:03:28.211
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

101
00:03:28.211 --> 00:03:28.301
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

102
00:03:28.301 --> 00:03:30.850
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing left but a little hosp 5% of you.</v>

103
00:03:30.851 --> 00:03:31.211
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

104
00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:31.660
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

105
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.870
<v Speaker 1>if that 5% is solid,</v>

106
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.020
<v Speaker 1>then maybe that's exactly what you want to have happen.</v>

107
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

108
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.060
<v Speaker 1>so I told you that story is an elaboration of this line,</v>

109
00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:45.910
<v Speaker 1>and God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every</v>

110
00:03:45.911 --> 00:03:49.270
<v Speaker 1>imagine have the imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil</v>

111
00:03:49.271 --> 00:03:51.820
<v Speaker 1>continually to question worth asking.</v>

112
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.300
<v Speaker 1>Just exactly what are your motives?</v>

113
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:56.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

114
00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

115
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.800
<v Speaker 1>maybe they're purer than mine were and it's certainly possible.</v>

116
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that I'm naturally a particularly good person.</v>

117
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.900
<v Speaker 1>I think I have to work at it very,</v>

118
00:04:04.901 --> 00:04:05.740
<v Speaker 1>very hard.</v>

119
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.800
<v Speaker 1>And I don't necessarily think that everyone is like that,</v>

120
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.670
<v Speaker 1>but some people are worse than that and everyone's like that to some degree.</v>

121
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.610
<v Speaker 1>So it's worth thinking about just how much trouble are you trying to cause,</v>

122
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.841
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

123
00:04:22.841 --> 00:04:25.270
<v Speaker 1>and the other thing you might think about is that if you're not doing something</v>

124
00:04:25.271 --> 00:04:28.000
<v Speaker 1>important with your life by your own definition,</v>

125
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.800
<v Speaker 1>because that's the game that we're playing.</v>

126
00:04:29.801 --> 00:04:31.120
<v Speaker 1>You get to define the terms,</v>

127
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.290
<v Speaker 1>at least initially,</v>

128
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.010
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're prone to cause trouble just because you don't have anything better</v>

129
00:04:36.011 --> 00:04:40.390
<v Speaker 1>to do because at least it's trouble is more interesting than boring.</v>

130
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:41.111
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

131
00:04:41.111 --> 00:04:41.980
<v Speaker 1>that's something you learn.</v>

132
00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:45.280
<v Speaker 1>If you read Dostoyevsky Dusty Husky knew that extraordinarily well.</v>

133
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.050
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're not doing something,</v>

134
00:04:47.051 --> 00:04:49.660
<v Speaker 1>if you're not pushing yourself to the limit of your capacity,</v>

135
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.790
<v Speaker 1>then you have plenty of leftover.</v>

136
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.983
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

137
00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.210
<v Speaker 1>what would you say will power,</v>

138
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.020
<v Speaker 1>energy and resources to devote to causing interesting trouble?</v>

139
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:00.183
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

140
00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.331
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

141
00:05:01.331 --> 00:05:03.910
<v Speaker 1>so I would say this is also an archetypal scenario.</v>

142
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.240
<v Speaker 1>God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every</v>

143
00:05:07.241 --> 00:05:10.360
<v Speaker 1>imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.</v>

144
00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:12.880
<v Speaker 1>That's something to meditate on</v>

145
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.100
<v Speaker 1>and it's not self destructive because what it is is an attempt to,</v>

146
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.080
<v Speaker 1>it's like the diagnosis of an illness.</v>

147
00:05:20.081 --> 00:05:22.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like if that does happen to be the case for you,</v>

148
00:05:22.571 --> 00:05:23.590
<v Speaker 1>or to some degree,</v>

149
00:05:23.591 --> 00:05:25.390
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's only 10% of you or something,</v>

150
00:05:25.391 --> 00:05:29.860
<v Speaker 1>or maybe it's 90% well then coming to terms with that is excellent because then</v>

151
00:05:29.861 --> 00:05:31.150
<v Speaker 1>maybe you can stop doing it.</v>

152
00:05:31.151 --> 00:05:34.150
<v Speaker 1>And what would be the downside to that?</v>

153
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.700
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to give up your resentment,</v>

154
00:05:36.701 --> 00:05:38.380
<v Speaker 1>obviously in your hatred and all of that.</v>

155
00:05:38.381 --> 00:05:40.840
<v Speaker 1>And that's really annoying because those emotions are very,</v>

156
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:45.520
<v Speaker 1>they're easy to engage in in there and they're engaging and they have this</v>

157
00:05:45.521 --> 00:05:49.330
<v Speaker 1>feeling of self righteousness with them and that goes along with them.</v>

158
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:50.253
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

159
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.320
<v Speaker 1>you're not doing this in order to put yourself down.</v>

160
00:05:53.321 --> 00:05:57.340
<v Speaker 1>You're doing this in order to separate the wheat from the chaff and to leave</v>

161
00:05:57.341 --> 00:05:59.680
<v Speaker 1>everything that you don't have to be behind.</v>
