1
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:04.001
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2
00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:05.110
<v Speaker 1>you get these stories now.</v>

3
00:00:05.111 --> 00:00:07.960
<v Speaker 1>And then about these companies that come out with claims that their brain</v>

4
00:00:07.961 --> 00:00:12.130
<v Speaker 1>exercises can improve Iq and the literature on that is damn dismal.</v>

5
00:00:12.131 --> 00:00:16.510
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you it's that the holy grail is to produce cognitive exercises that</v>

6
00:00:16.511 --> 00:00:19.690
<v Speaker 1>produce a legitimate impact on fluid intelligence and,</v>

7
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.220
<v Speaker 1>and like there's been a lot of work done on that and the answer is so far is</v>

8
00:00:24.221 --> 00:00:25.390
<v Speaker 1>that it doesn't work.</v>

9
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:26.570
<v Speaker 2>So what about the game?</v>

10
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.270
<v Speaker 2>What about the video gay bank?</v>

11
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:28.671
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

12
00:00:28.671 --> 00:00:32.870
<v Speaker 2>I know there has been a suggestion that played video games actually improves at</v>

13
00:00:32.871 --> 00:00:34.970
<v Speaker 2>least sub aspects of intelligence.</v>

14
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.240
<v Speaker 2>There's a couple of studies that indicated that video games might improve</v>

15
00:00:38.241 --> 00:00:39.320
<v Speaker 2>spatial intelligence,</v>

16
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.570
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

17
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:39.980
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

18
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:40.813
<v Speaker 1>the problem,</v>

19
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:46.060
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is this is a critical problem or apps and insoluble one,</v>

20
00:00:46.111 --> 00:00:47.270
<v Speaker 1>or at least no one's solved it,</v>

21
00:00:47.271 --> 00:00:49.220
<v Speaker 1>is that what you get is that if you,</v>

22
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.640
<v Speaker 1>if you exercise yourself substantially on a given game,</v>

23
00:00:52.641 --> 00:00:55.130
<v Speaker 1>you can radically accelerate your performance in the game.</v>

24
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.010
<v Speaker 1>So you can get much better at those specific skill share.</v>

25
00:00:58.011 --> 00:01:01.310
<v Speaker 1>But you don't get generalization across cognitive sets,</v>

26
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.590
<v Speaker 1>which is what you're really hoping for it because I thought,</v>

27
00:01:03.591 --> 00:01:05.300
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was the claim from some of these.</v>

28
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.480
<v Speaker 1>They have shown some increases in spatial Iq,</v>

29
00:01:08.481 --> 00:01:12.950
<v Speaker 1>but there's not very many studies and I would say they're far overbalanced by</v>

30
00:01:12.951 --> 00:01:15.740
<v Speaker 1>the other side of the research equation,</v>

31
00:01:15.741 --> 00:01:17.450
<v Speaker 1>which continually says,</v>

32
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.710
<v Speaker 1>and I've looked at this because I'm really interested in the improvement of Iq.</v>

33
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:22.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>

34
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.110
<v Speaker 1>that's the holy grail in some sense.</v>

35
00:01:24.111 --> 00:01:24.944
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

36
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.490
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

37
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:26.323
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

38
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.513
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

39
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.890
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

40
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:28.340
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

41
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.090
<v Speaker 1>the overwhelming preponderance of evidence suggests that you don't get</v>

42
00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:34.640
<v Speaker 1>generalization outside the narrow domain.</v>

43
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.110
<v Speaker 1>Now why that is,</v>

44
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.921
<v Speaker 1>and even this,</v>

45
00:01:36.921 --> 00:01:37.671
<v Speaker 1>it's even worse.</v>

46
00:01:37.671 --> 00:01:37.821
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

47
00:01:37.821 --> 00:01:38.541
<v Speaker 1>because you might say,</v>

48
00:01:38.541 --> 00:01:39.230
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

49
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.190
<v Speaker 1>imagine that you could take five different domains of intelligence still</v>

50
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.340
<v Speaker 1>associated type with g and you had people practice routines in all five</v>

51
00:01:49.191 --> 00:01:50.060
<v Speaker 1>dimensions.</v>

52
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.970
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you'd get generalization under those circumstances.</v>

53
00:01:52.971 --> 00:01:53.900
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

54
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:54.420
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

55
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.860
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

56
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.160
<v Speaker 1>the results of the research attempting that indicate that no,</v>

57
00:01:58.161 --> 00:02:01.040
<v Speaker 1>as soon as you move away from those specific practice instances,</v>

58
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.660
<v Speaker 1>you don't get generalization.</v>

59
00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.860
<v Speaker 2>So I guess it's,</v>

60
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.270
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's subways.</v>

61
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.140
<v Speaker 2>Some of this is to be expected from the consideration that everything is an</v>

62
00:02:10.141 --> 00:02:14.940
<v Speaker 2>allocation problem with it within the body at Bray into um,</v>

63
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.930
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

64
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:16.141
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

65
00:02:16.141 --> 00:02:17.280
<v Speaker 2>by a large</v>

66
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.850
<v Speaker 2>an improvement blood domain tends to be bought at the expense of something else.</v>

67
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.973
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

68
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:26.803
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

69
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:27.773
<v Speaker 2>just that.</v>

70
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.990
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

71
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.230
<v Speaker 1>And then conscientiousness,</v>

72
00:02:30.231 --> 00:02:31.940
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you some research we've done.</v>

73
00:02:31.941 --> 00:02:32.774
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

74
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.870
<v Speaker 1>Although we haven't been able to demonstrate that it's actually improved.</v>

75
00:02:35.871 --> 00:02:36.800
<v Speaker 1>Conscientiousness,</v>

76
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.490
<v Speaker 1>the first thing to note about conscientiousness is that no one understands it at</v>

77
00:02:40.491 --> 00:02:41.324
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

78
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.010
<v Speaker 1>especially the industriousness element.</v>

79
00:02:43.011 --> 00:02:45.710
<v Speaker 1>There's no plausible biological,</v>

80
00:02:45.711 --> 00:02:50.330
<v Speaker 1>psychological neurophysiological or animal models for conscientiousness.</v>

81
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.340
<v Speaker 1>All we've got is self reports.</v>

82
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.640
<v Speaker 1>We can't even find tasks that conscientious people do better.</v>

83
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.260
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievable.</v>

84
00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:58.723
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

85
00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:00.900
<v Speaker 1>blue self reports really awesome.</v>

86
00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.180
<v Speaker 1>Well you can get reports from teachers and parents and so forth,</v>

87
00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:05.560
<v Speaker 1>but it's all human report.</v>

88
00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.320
<v Speaker 1>She only way we can measure it and we didn't know.</v>

89
00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:12.130
<v Speaker 1>Like in my lab we probably tried 200 tasks trying to find something that</v>

90
00:03:12.131 --> 00:03:13.030
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness,</v>

91
00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:14.500
<v Speaker 1>conscientious people do better.</v>

92
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:15.753
<v Speaker 1>No luck.</v>

93
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.050
<v Speaker 1>We can derive it from linguistic analysis of verbal output now to some degree.</v>

94
00:03:20.051 --> 00:03:21.430
<v Speaker 1>But that's still,</v>

95
00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:22.540
<v Speaker 1>that's not a task,</v>

96
00:03:22.541 --> 00:03:23.374
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

97
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.530
<v Speaker 1>So now we,</v>

98
00:03:25.531 --> 00:03:29.800
<v Speaker 1>we produced a series of programs called the self authoring suite and one of</v>

99
00:03:29.801 --> 00:03:30.190
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

100
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.900
<v Speaker 1>the future authoring program to writing program that helps people lay out their</v>

101
00:03:34.901 --> 00:03:37.130
<v Speaker 1>plans for the future in,</v>

102
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.811
<v Speaker 1>in detail.</v>

103
00:03:37.811 --> 00:03:39.280
<v Speaker 1>So they have to consider their,</v>

104
00:03:39.281 --> 00:03:40.114
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

105
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.910
<v Speaker 1>their intimate relationships,</v>

106
00:03:42.911 --> 00:03:43.840
<v Speaker 1>their career goals,</v>

107
00:03:43.841 --> 00:03:44.980
<v Speaker 1>their educational goals,</v>

108
00:03:44.981 --> 00:03:46.600
<v Speaker 1>their use of time outside work,</v>

109
00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:50.050
<v Speaker 1>their plans to maintain mental and physical health or their use of drugs and</v>

110
00:03:50.051 --> 00:03:50.800
<v Speaker 1>alcohol.</v>

111
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.550
<v Speaker 1>They have to write for 15 minutes about what kind of life they'd like to have if</v>

112
00:03:54.551 --> 00:03:57.820
<v Speaker 1>they were taking care of themselves three to five years in the future.</v>

113
00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.330
<v Speaker 1>And then to write for the same amount of time about how terrible their life</v>

114
00:04:01.331 --> 00:04:04.030
<v Speaker 1>could be if all their bad habits took control.</v>

115
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.640
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

116
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.050
<v Speaker 1>And then they have to turn the pause division into an implementable plan.</v>

117
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.930
<v Speaker 1>And we've managed to improve their college grades by about 20% and dropout there</v>

118
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.970
<v Speaker 1>drug dropped their dropout rate by about 25% over about 10,000 students now.</v>

119
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:19.181
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

120
00:04:19.181 --> 00:04:22.950
<v Speaker 1>we tried to see if that was mediated by an improvement and conscientiousness and</v>

121
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.310
<v Speaker 1>there was no evidence for that.</v>

122
00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.530
<v Speaker 1>Now what it was mediated by was number of words written during the exercise.</v>

123
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.700
<v Speaker 1>So it turns out that thinking more about your future helps,</v>

124
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:34.780
<v Speaker 1>the more you think about it,</v>

125
00:04:34.781 --> 00:04:35.614
<v Speaker 1>the more it helps.</v>

126
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:36.610
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that,</v>

127
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:37.121
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

128
00:04:37.121 --> 00:04:40.570
<v Speaker 1>maybe that would translate into an improvement in conscientiousness across time.</v>

129
00:04:40.571 --> 00:04:41.710
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

130
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.780
<v Speaker 1>there haven't been any credible studies that I know of indicating that there are</v>

131
00:04:46.781 --> 00:04:50.620
<v Speaker 1>exercises that can be done to improve conscientiousness.</v>

132
00:04:50.621 --> 00:04:51.460
<v Speaker 1>So that's also,</v>

133
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:52.773
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

134
00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.260
<v Speaker 1>troublesome and worrisome because that would be a nice thing to be able to do</v>

135
00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:57.340
<v Speaker 1>content.</v>

136
00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.173
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

137
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.590
<v Speaker 2>I haven't thought much about it and I don't know much about the literature and</v>

138
00:05:01.591 --> 00:05:03.240
<v Speaker 2>cut yet just this as a trait.</v>

139
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.490
<v Speaker 2>But the word seems to connote to me as an ordinary English speaker has a strong</v>

140
00:05:08.491 --> 00:05:10.020
<v Speaker 2>social element to it as well.</v>

141
00:05:10.021 --> 00:05:13.860
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of like a country yet just person is somebody who doesn't forget his</v>

142
00:05:13.861 --> 00:05:14.790
<v Speaker 2>obligations.</v>

143
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.170
<v Speaker 2>Your index of conscientiousness and a university professor is,</v>

144
00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:20.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

145
00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.730
<v Speaker 2>somebody has asked you to write them a reference letter for getting into</v>

146
00:05:23.731 --> 00:05:25.070
<v Speaker 2>graduate school or whatever.</v>

147
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.590
<v Speaker 2>Do you actually prioritize and get the Dab to think dotted Tibor is there some</v>

148
00:05:28.591 --> 00:05:31.800
<v Speaker 2>risks that you'll just forget about it and shove it to them somewhere else?</v>

149
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:32.700
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

150
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.100
<v Speaker 2>I imagine cut,</v>

151
00:05:34.101 --> 00:05:34.651
<v Speaker 2>she had just,</v>

152
00:05:34.651 --> 00:05:36.560
<v Speaker 2>this is having a strong element of,</v>

153
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.640
<v Speaker 2>of attentiveness to social obligation and to the wellbeing of others as it is</v>

154
00:05:42.241 --> 00:05:43.440
<v Speaker 2>defined in the personality.</v>

155
00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.880
<v Speaker 2>Literature doesn't have any of that.</v>

156
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:45.210
<v Speaker 2>Well</v>

157
00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.500
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

158
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.960
<v Speaker 1>I would say not so much attention to the wellbeing of others because that's more</v>

159
00:05:48.961 --> 00:05:50.280
<v Speaker 1>trait agreeableness.</v>

160
00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:50.520
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

161
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.780
<v Speaker 1>That's more than maternal dimension.</v>

162
00:05:51.781 --> 00:05:55.950
<v Speaker 1>But there's definitely a massive effect of social obligation,</v>

163
00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.690
<v Speaker 1>which is part of the reason why conservatives tend to be hired</v>

164
00:05:59.691 --> 00:06:00.530
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness,</v>

165
00:06:00.531 --> 00:06:01.364
<v Speaker 1>the liberals,</v>

166
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.230
<v Speaker 1>but it's not well being of others.</v>

167
00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:04.064
<v Speaker 1>It's duty.</v>

168
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.301
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>

169
00:06:06.301 --> 00:06:06.620
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

170
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:11.090
<v Speaker 1>the conscientious types may form and maintain social contracts.</v>

171
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:12.290
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

172
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:13.850
<v Speaker 1>They implement their plans.</v>

173
00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:14.870
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

174
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.860
<v Speaker 1>And they seem to feel shame and self contempt when they,</v>

175
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.740
<v Speaker 1>when they fail to live up to their social obligations.</v>

176
00:06:21.741 --> 00:06:25.070
<v Speaker 1>And so that's another thing that's interesting about the income redistribution</v>

177
00:06:25.071 --> 00:06:29.960
<v Speaker 1>idea because it's conceivable to me that conscientious people would hate that</v>

178
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.110
<v Speaker 1>because conscientious people do very badly.</v>

179
00:06:33.111 --> 00:06:33.681
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

180
00:06:33.681 --> 00:06:34.310
<v Speaker 1>if they're on,</v>

181
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.690
<v Speaker 1>if they're laid off from work,</v>

182
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.130
<v Speaker 1>even if it's not their fault,</v>

183
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.980
<v Speaker 1>they still take themselves apart for their failure.</v>

184
00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:45.680
<v Speaker 1>So and so conscientious people in particular seem to find in activity without</v>

185
00:06:47.001 --> 00:06:47.834
<v Speaker 1>productivity,</v>

186
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.910
<v Speaker 1>highly aversive and adverse if enough to really cause them in all major health</v>

187
00:06:52.911 --> 00:06:53.744
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

188
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:54.793
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

189
00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:55.741
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

190
00:06:55.741 --> 00:06:56.131
<v Speaker 2>that could,</v>

191
00:06:56.131 --> 00:06:58.860
<v Speaker 2>that brings us back to what we were discussing a little while ago,</v>

192
00:06:58.861 --> 00:06:59.930
<v Speaker 2>the problem of</v>

193
00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:01.473
<v Speaker 3>hub,</v>

194
00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:08.410
<v Speaker 2>ensuring that large numbers people have access to BD goof all work in an age at</v>

195
00:07:09.741 --> 00:07:12.020
<v Speaker 2>which it is more and more the case that uh,</v>

196
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:17.140
<v Speaker 2>the big components of the economy of our Blue Bay got away with very few</v>

197
00:07:17.751 --> 00:07:18.584
<v Speaker 2>employees.</v>

198
00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:19.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

199
00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.720
<v Speaker 2>I that's going to continue.</v>

200
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:25.870
<v Speaker 2>That's probably going to ask away or back to that same topic to some extent.</v>

201
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.553
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

202
00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:28.971
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

203
00:07:28.971 --> 00:07:29.041
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

204
00:07:29.041 --> 00:07:29.874
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think,</v>

205
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:35.200
<v Speaker 2>I think any inequality of opportunity is sort of the bottom are bedrock of any</v>

206
00:07:37.861 --> 00:07:38.694
<v Speaker 2>quality.</v>

207
00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:39.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

208
00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.690
<v Speaker 2>Having its impacts upon us.</v>

209
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:42.520
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

210
00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:43.550
<v Speaker 2>it's certainly the bond,</v>

211
00:07:43.551 --> 00:07:44.400
<v Speaker 2>but bedrock of,</v>

212
00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:45.483
<v Speaker 2>of</v>

213
00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.470
<v Speaker 2>why we should care about it.</v>

214
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:50.090
<v Speaker 2>Odd moral and social justice.</v>

215
00:07:50.091 --> 00:07:51.590
<v Speaker 2>Grouts it's like,</v>

216
00:07:51.591 --> 00:07:54.380
<v Speaker 2>well why should people who,</v>

217
00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:56.290
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

218
00:07:56.290 --> 00:08:00.070
<v Speaker 2>why should [inaudible] birthright affect the opportunity is available to what</v>

219
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:01.383
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

220
00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:02.111
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

221
00:08:02.111 --> 00:08:06.340
<v Speaker 1>it's also with social catastrophe because hypothetically you want to set up a</v>

222
00:08:06.341 --> 00:08:11.341
<v Speaker 1>society so that whatever someone has to offer is maximally offerable to the</v>

223
00:08:13.091 --> 00:08:15.310
<v Speaker 1>community because otherwise the community loses.</v>

224
00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:16.150
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

225
00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:16.931
<v Speaker 1>Now it seems to be,</v>

226
00:08:16.931 --> 00:08:17.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

227
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.270
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the great examples of that,</v>

228
00:08:19.271 --> 00:08:21.220
<v Speaker 1>although I don't think this accounts for all of it,</v>

229
00:08:21.221 --> 00:08:25.390
<v Speaker 1>is that the relationship between the provision of women's rights by countries</v>

230
00:08:25.391 --> 00:08:28.210
<v Speaker 1>and their economic productivity is staggeringly high.</v>

231
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:33.900
<v Speaker 1>So I think that also has to do with o openness in general to transformation and</v>

232
00:08:34.541 --> 00:08:35.530
<v Speaker 1>change with,</v>

233
00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:36.010
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

234
00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:38.800
<v Speaker 1>with the provision of women's rights being an index of that.</v>

235
00:08:38.801 --> 00:08:39.730
<v Speaker 1>But nonetheless,</v>

236
00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.820
<v Speaker 1>it's a great predictor of the eventual economic success.</v>

237
00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:43.760
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

238
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:48.180
<v Speaker 2>partly it had ducks and partly perhaps bar more direct effect that after all,</v>

239
00:08:48.181 --> 00:08:50.380
<v Speaker 2>it slightly over half the population,</v>

240
00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:51.550
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

241
00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:55.180
<v Speaker 2>maybe their talents are better utilized.</v>

242
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:56.263
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

243
00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:58.680
<v Speaker 1>that's certainly what we would hope.</v>

244
00:08:58.830 --> 00:08:59.660
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

245
00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:00.091
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

246
00:09:00.091 --> 00:09:00.661
<v Speaker 1>as you said,</v>

247
00:09:00.661 --> 00:09:02.760
<v Speaker 1>I think the evidence at least suggests that.</v>

248
00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:03.541
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

249
00:09:03.541 --> 00:09:03.811
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

250
00:09:03.811 --> 00:09:05.520
<v Speaker 1>so let me recapitulate,</v>

251
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:07.770
<v Speaker 1>because we should probably fold this up.</v>

252
00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:09.270
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

253
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:10.230
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
