1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:00.973
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

2
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.870
<v Speaker 1>the next part of the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some parallels with Abraham and</v>

3
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.880
<v Speaker 1>that's built into the narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think because Isaac is Abraham's</v>

4
00:00:16.881 --> 00:00:21.860
<v Speaker 1>descendant and so we have to keep the</v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative echoing forward.</v>

5
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.020
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise it loses its,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's continuity.</v>

6
00:00:24.021 --> 00:00:27.230
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a famine in the land that</v>

7
00:00:27.231 --> 00:00:32.060
<v Speaker 1>Isaac Isaacson and God tells him to stay</v>
<v Speaker 1>the course anyways,</v>

8
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.480
<v Speaker 1>repeating the promise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

9
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.560
<v Speaker 1>he gave Abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although Isaac goes to Abdel Malek,</v>

10
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.490
<v Speaker 1>also telling the king and people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rebecca was his sister,</v>

11
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.860
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what Abraham did when</v>
<v Speaker 1>he went to Egypt.</v>

12
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.350
<v Speaker 1>And so there's another echo there of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same,</v>

13
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.730
<v Speaker 1>the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's as if the story is being told for a</v>

14
00:00:49.731 --> 00:00:52.640
<v Speaker 1>second time essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's supposed to remind you of</v>

15
00:00:52.641 --> 00:00:54.080
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the previous story,</v>

16
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.290
<v Speaker 1>but they're careless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The king sees that Rebecca and Isaac are</v>

17
00:00:59.331 --> 00:01:01.610
<v Speaker 1>intimate together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

18
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.770
<v Speaker 1>luckily he doesn't have them put to</v>
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

19
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.920
<v Speaker 1>He just tells everybody in the kingdom</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there to be left the hell alone.</v>

20
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.250
<v Speaker 1>And then Isaac prospers in that land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like Abraham did in Egypt until the</v>

21
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.310
<v Speaker 1>Philistines asked him to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just getting too rich and powerful.</v>

22
00:01:16.311 --> 00:01:18.110
<v Speaker 1>Things are going too well for him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's asked to.</v>

23
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.170
<v Speaker 1>He's asked to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

24
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.890
<v Speaker 1>in the meantime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Esau gets married and this is a funny</v>

25
00:01:24.891 --> 00:01:28.130
<v Speaker 1>little story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says he marries two women who give</v>

26
00:01:28.131 --> 00:01:30.690
<v Speaker 1>grief to Isaac and Rebecca,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they,</v>

27
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.740
<v Speaker 1>whoever he saw Mary's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not popular with his,</v>

28
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.140
<v Speaker 1>with their in laws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not in the least.</v>

29
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.040
<v Speaker 1>That actually becomes relevant a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>later because they drive rebecca quite</v>

30
00:01:40.041 --> 00:01:42.200
<v Speaker 1>mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I get a kick out of that because</v>

31
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.520
<v Speaker 1>that's very common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

32
00:01:43.521 --> 00:01:48.521
<v Speaker 1>it's not easy to integrate new people</v>
<v Speaker 1>into your family and hope that that will</v>

33
00:01:49.311 --> 00:01:50.900
<v Speaker 1>go smoothly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually one of the real</v>

34
00:01:50.901 --> 00:01:52.310
<v Speaker 1>catastrophes in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

35
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.400
<v Speaker 1>You have a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you get along with them and maybe</v>

36
00:01:55.401 --> 00:01:57.800
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's assume you do,</v>

37
00:01:57.801 --> 00:02:02.210
<v Speaker 1>but then they marry someone that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>just don't like and or maybe you think</v>

38
00:02:02.211 --> 00:02:03.410
<v Speaker 1>is wrong for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

39
00:02:03.411 --> 00:02:05.840
<v Speaker 1>that's really rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what are you going to do about</v>

40
00:02:05.841 --> 00:02:06.790
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

41
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.890
<v Speaker 1>because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're basically screwed both ways.</v>

42
00:02:09.891 --> 00:02:12.630
<v Speaker 1>If you have the person you love around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have to put up with this</v>

43
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.960
<v Speaker 1>horrendous creature that they allied</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves with.</v>

44
00:02:14.961 --> 00:02:17.600
<v Speaker 1>And if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you get rid of them completely,</v>

45
00:02:17.601 --> 00:02:19.700
<v Speaker 1>well then you know you don't have your</v>
<v Speaker 1>child anymore.</v>

46
00:02:19.701 --> 00:02:22.040
<v Speaker 1>So it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult position.</v>

47
00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:24.860
<v Speaker 1>And so that's another example of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>realism,</v>

48
00:02:24.861 --> 00:02:25.910
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the stories.</v>

49
00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.303
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isaac,</v>

50
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.760
<v Speaker 1>who's hypothetically on his deathbed</v>
<v Speaker 1>asks Esl to hunt for Venison because he</v>

51
00:02:31.761 --> 00:02:35.600
<v Speaker 1>likes venison and he's happy that his</v>
<v Speaker 1>son is a hunter and Rebecca overhears</v>

52
00:02:35.601 --> 00:02:39.710
<v Speaker 1>this so she conspires with Jacob,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

53
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.970
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to slaughter to small goats and make his</v>

54
00:02:45.081 --> 00:02:49.100
<v Speaker 1>father is some stew because he wants to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make him stew out of venison.</v>

55
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.170
<v Speaker 1>But Rebecca,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's being,</v>

56
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.040
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say slightly deceitful or horribly</v>

57
00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:57.410
<v Speaker 1>lying that would be more accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

58
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.420
<v Speaker 1>she conspires with Jacob.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jacob kills two little goats kids and</v>

59
00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.950
<v Speaker 1>boils,</v>
<v Speaker 1>APA stew.</v>

60
00:03:02.951 --> 00:03:04.430
<v Speaker 1>And then he puts on some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

61
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.110
<v Speaker 1>are goatskins because Esau was a hairy</v>
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>

62
00:03:08.111 --> 00:03:12.730
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Rebecca Dresses Isaac in east</v>

63
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.310
<v Speaker 1>clothing because Isaac can't see very</v>
<v Speaker 1>well at this point.</v>

64
00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:20.311
<v Speaker 1>And so then Jacob goes into his father</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the stew and he's trying to</v>

65
00:03:20.981 --> 00:03:23.350
<v Speaker 1>disguise his voice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't work very well.</v>

66
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.630
<v Speaker 1>And so Isaac asks them to come close and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jacob puts out his arm with the goat</v>

67
00:03:28.631 --> 00:03:31.210
<v Speaker 1>skin on it and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Isaac smells him too.</v>

68
00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:35.710
<v Speaker 1>And he smells like Esl and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which maybe wasn't the best thing,</v>

69
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.120
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

70
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.470
<v Speaker 1>and feels like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

71
00:03:38.471 --> 00:03:39.870
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

72
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.130
<v Speaker 1>because Isaac thinks he's on his</v>
<v Speaker 1>deathbed,</v>

73
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.530
<v Speaker 1>he decides to deliver a blessing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically to Esol.</v>

74
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.800
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's Jacob.</v>

75
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.950
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a big deal too because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>blessing is actually,</v>

76
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.170
<v Speaker 1>as I said before with these ancient</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

77
00:03:56.171 --> 00:03:58.900
<v Speaker 1>it appeared as though once you said</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

78
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.910
<v Speaker 1>you didn't get to take it back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't say,</v>

79
00:04:00.911 --> 00:04:03.250
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've deceived me.</v>

80
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.740
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't count.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like I did.</v>

81
00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.390
<v Speaker 1>They weren't maybe as</v>
<v Speaker 1>as</v>

82
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.990
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>week might be one way of thinking about</v>

83
00:04:13.991 --> 00:04:15.460
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but another way is they weren't quite as</v>

84
00:04:15.461 --> 00:04:16.990
<v Speaker 1>attentive to context,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

85
00:04:16.991 --> 00:04:20.260
<v Speaker 1>because if I make you a deal and then it</v>
<v Speaker 1>turns out that you betrayed me,</v>

86
00:04:20.261 --> 00:04:24.820
<v Speaker 1>I may feel that the deal is no longer</v>
<v Speaker 1>valid because the assumption was you</v>

87
00:04:24.821 --> 00:04:28.360
<v Speaker 1>were being honest to be given within</v>
<v Speaker 1>that violates the whole spirit.</v>

88
00:04:28.361 --> 00:04:31.240
<v Speaker 1>But that isn't how these people thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said once he promised man,</v>

89
00:04:31.241 --> 00:04:32.560
<v Speaker 1>you promised,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was that.</v>

90
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.160
<v Speaker 1>So Isaac Blessed Jacob.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says that God give you the dew of</v>

91
00:04:38.711 --> 00:04:41.320
<v Speaker 1>heaven and the fatness of the earth and</v>
<v Speaker 1>plenty of corn and wine.</v>

92
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.810
<v Speaker 1>Let people serve you and nations bow</v>
<v Speaker 1>down to you.</v>

93
00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.350
<v Speaker 1>Be Lord over their brethren that's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be rough on Esl.</v>

94
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.850
<v Speaker 1>Let thy mother's sons bow down to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cursive.</v>

95
00:04:49.851 --> 00:04:53.240
<v Speaker 1>Be everyone that curse if the blessing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he blesses blessing.</v>

96
00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.160
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a credit remarkable</v>
<v Speaker 1>painting of that.</v>

97
00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.820
<v Speaker 1>So there's Rebecca,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's looking pretty old and Isaac's</v>

98
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.700
<v Speaker 1>looking pretty blind and Jacob's taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>directions from his mother and we might</v>

99
00:05:06.701 --> 00:05:09.850
<v Speaker 1>say he's perhaps a little old to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking more or lessons from his mother,</v>

100
00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:13.270
<v Speaker 1>especially given how she's acting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a pretty ugly scene</v>

101
00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:16.210
<v Speaker 1>altogether,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially that we also know that Jacob</v>

102
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.600
<v Speaker 1>already tricked Esau out of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>birthright.</v>

103
00:05:19.601 --> 00:05:23.110
<v Speaker 1>And so now he's like taking the</v>
<v Speaker 1>birthright and he's taken the blessing.</v>

104
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:28.410
<v Speaker 1>And so as I said that Jacob,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he turns out to be the father of Israel.</v>

105
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.810
<v Speaker 1>It's like he's a reprehensible</v>
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>

106
00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:35.770
<v Speaker 1>These are major league betrayals that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's engaging and it's not trivial.</v>

107
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.430
<v Speaker 1>He really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really pulls the rug out from under his</v>

108
00:05:39.431 --> 00:05:40.570
<v Speaker 1>brother and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say,</v>

109
00:05:40.571 --> 00:05:43.660
<v Speaker 1>well Esl is not as awake as he might be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

110
00:05:43.661 --> 00:05:48.080
<v Speaker 1>he's kind of a wild man and fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it certainly seems to me that,</v>

111
00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:52.360
<v Speaker 1>that the predominant moral error falls</v>
<v Speaker 1>on Jacob's shoulders.</v>

112
00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:54.790
<v Speaker 1>It's very treacherous behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he's doing.</v>

113
00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.780
<v Speaker 1>So then Esau shows up and he's got a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice Steg for his dad and it's like</v>

114
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.180
<v Speaker 1>little late for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he states that his brother was</v>

115
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:08.600
<v Speaker 1>rightly named Jacob,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means supplanter because he's been</v>

116
00:06:08.601 --> 00:06:12.680
<v Speaker 1>deceived twice and Isaac says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isaac answered.</v>

117
00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.950
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's asking for Esl,</v>

118
00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:17.840
<v Speaker 1>was asking fundamentally if there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything at all leftover for him.</v>

119
00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:21.500
<v Speaker 1>And Isaac can't give him the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>blessing because that's already been</v>

120
00:06:21.501 --> 00:06:23.360
<v Speaker 1>given.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he has to think of something else.</v>

121
00:06:23.361 --> 00:06:26.230
<v Speaker 1>And Isaac says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>behold,</v>

122
00:06:26.231 --> 00:06:27.800
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've made him my Lord,</v>

123
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.470
<v Speaker 1>and all his brothers I've given to him</v>
<v Speaker 1>for servant,</v>

124
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.990
<v Speaker 1>which includes you and with corn and</v>
<v Speaker 1>wine,</v>

125
00:06:32.991 --> 00:06:33.900
<v Speaker 1>have I sustained him?</v>

126
00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.610
<v Speaker 1>And what shall I now doing tv my son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Esau said unto his father,</v>

127
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:42.230
<v Speaker 1>how have you even one blessing for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my father bless me also.</v>

128
00:06:42.231 --> 00:06:44.600
<v Speaker 1>And An esaw lifted up his voice and</v>
<v Speaker 1>wept.</v>

129
00:06:44.601 --> 00:06:46.550
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we already know that Esau is a pretty</v>

130
00:06:46.551 --> 00:06:49.400
<v Speaker 1>tough guy by all appearances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

131
00:06:49.401 --> 00:06:51.290
<v Speaker 1>he's out there hunting on his own and</v>
<v Speaker 1>camping.</v>

132
00:06:51.291 --> 00:06:54.200
<v Speaker 1>And it's like he's no pushover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that this reduces him to</v>

133
00:06:54.201 --> 00:06:57.800
<v Speaker 1>tears is an indication of the magnitude</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the betrayal.</v>

134
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.010
<v Speaker 1>And Isaac says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>behold,</v>

135
00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.020
<v Speaker 1>thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>earth and of the dew of heaven,</v>

136
00:07:03.021 --> 00:07:05.420
<v Speaker 1>from above and by Thy Sword,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thou shall live,</v>

137
00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:09.080
<v Speaker 1>and thou shalt serve your brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it shall come to pass when you will</v>

138
00:07:09.081 --> 00:07:11.150
<v Speaker 1>have the domain Indian and you'll break</v>
<v Speaker 1>the yolk.</v>

139
00:07:11.151 --> 00:07:14.600
<v Speaker 1>His yoke off from died neck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Esol hated Jacob because of the</v>

140
00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:16.730
<v Speaker 1>blessing where with his father blessed</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

141
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.630
<v Speaker 1>And Esau said in his heart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the days of mourning for my father are</v>

142
00:07:20.631 --> 00:07:23.210
<v Speaker 1>at hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I will slay my brother Jacob.</v>

143
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:25.680
<v Speaker 1>So fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

144
00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:29.630
<v Speaker 1>if Isaac dies or when he dies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we'll mourn for him.</v>

145
00:07:29.631 --> 00:07:34.631
<v Speaker 1>And then Jacob better look the hell out</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's like it's serious death</v>

146
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.530
<v Speaker 1>coming his way.</v>
