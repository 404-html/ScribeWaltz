1
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.440
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.260
<v Speaker 2>So one of the propositions that I</v>

3
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.090
<v Speaker 2>set forth for you last week was that the most real things are the things that</v>

4
00:00:30.651 --> 00:00:35.651
<v Speaker 2>are most permanent across time and that manifest themselves in the largest</v>

5
00:00:36.831 --> 00:00:38.030
<v Speaker 2>number of situations.</v>

6
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.170
<v Speaker 2>And those are the things that you have to map successfully in order to survive,</v>

7
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.540
<v Speaker 2>survive as individuals,</v>

8
00:00:44.541 --> 00:00:47.150
<v Speaker 2>but survive as a species over a very long period of time.</v>

9
00:00:47.151 --> 00:00:49.430
<v Speaker 2>And so the question is,</v>

10
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.580
<v Speaker 2>one question is what are the constants of experience if you are a follower of</v>

11
00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:03.420
<v Speaker 2>the evolutionary psychologists and to some degree the evolutionary biologists,</v>

12
00:01:03.421 --> 00:01:05.030
<v Speaker 2>but I would say more the psychologists</v>

13
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.340
<v Speaker 2>like to be and caused meetings.</v>

14
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.440
<v Speaker 2>They have a very afro centric view of human evolution.</v>

15
00:01:16.441 --> 00:01:18.640
<v Speaker 2>And the idea basically is that</v>

16
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.490
<v Speaker 2>after we diverged from the common answer ancestor between chimpanzees,</v>

17
00:01:25.491 --> 00:01:27.410
<v Speaker 2>Bonobos and human beings,</v>

18
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.900
<v Speaker 2>we spent a tremendous amount of time in the African environment,</v>

19
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.370
<v Speaker 2>mostly on the Velt,</v>

20
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.100
<v Speaker 2>although we're not absolutely certain about that.</v>

21
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.780
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

22
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.050
<v Speaker 2>we're also very good in water human beings and we have some of the features of</v>

23
00:01:42.051 --> 00:01:43.190
<v Speaker 2>aquatic mammals.</v>

24
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:44.803
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

25
00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:45.470
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

26
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.030
<v Speaker 2>well hairlessness being one of them.</v>

27
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.230
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

28
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.370
<v Speaker 2>women have a subcutaneous layer of fat or feed your quite nicely adapted for</v>

29
00:01:52.371 --> 00:01:53.204
<v Speaker 2>swimming.</v>

30
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.740
<v Speaker 2>And so Buckminster fuller,</v>

31
00:01:54.741 --> 00:01:57.830
<v Speaker 2>who I wouldn't call a mainstream evolutionary psychologist,</v>

32
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.270
<v Speaker 2>hypothesized back in the 70s that we spent some period of time in our</v>

33
00:02:02.271 --> 00:02:05.150
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary history living on beaches near the ocean.</v>

34
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.810
<v Speaker 2>I had that idea really,</v>

35
00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:07.813
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

36
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:13.120
<v Speaker 2>echoes for me because we like beaches a lot and it's a great place if you want</v>

37
00:02:13.311 --> 00:02:14.210
<v Speaker 2>to get easy food.</v>

38
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.620
<v Speaker 2>And we're pretty damn good at swimming for terrestrial mammals and we are</v>

39
00:02:18.621 --> 00:02:22.490
<v Speaker 2>hairless and we do cry salt tiers and there's a lot of evidence that we,</v>

40
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.271
<v Speaker 2>and our feet,</v>

41
00:02:23.271 --> 00:02:24.200
<v Speaker 2>if you think about our feet,</v>

42
00:02:24.201 --> 00:02:24.980
<v Speaker 2>they're quite slipper.</v>

43
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.890
<v Speaker 2>Like I know we all stand up and all that and walk.</v>

44
00:02:27.891 --> 00:02:29.360
<v Speaker 2>So that's part of the adaptation,</v>

45
00:02:29.361 --> 00:02:30.920
<v Speaker 2>but we're pretty good at swimming.</v>

46
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.230
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

47
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.820
<v Speaker 2>the classical evolutionary psychology view is that we spent most of our time on</v>

48
00:02:37.821 --> 00:02:42.230
<v Speaker 2>the African Veldt and the critical period of our evolutionary development,</v>

49
00:02:42.231 --> 00:02:42.681
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

50
00:02:42.681 --> 00:02:47.330
<v Speaker 2>after we diverged from this common ancestor and that were adapted for that</v>

51
00:02:47.331 --> 00:02:47.901
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>

52
00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:51.710
<v Speaker 2>And one of the consequences of that is the idea that we're,</v>

53
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.410
<v Speaker 2>that things have changed so much around us,</v>

54
00:02:54.411 --> 00:02:58.010
<v Speaker 2>that we're really not adapted to the environment that we're in anymore.</v>

55
00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.310
<v Speaker 2>And I don't really believe because I think that the idea that the primary forces</v>

56
00:03:03.671 --> 00:03:07.750
<v Speaker 2>that shaped our evolution shaped them during that period of time,</v>

57
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.260
<v Speaker 2>call it us roughly a 7 million period,</v>

58
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.310
<v Speaker 2>year period of time,</v>

59
00:03:12.311 --> 00:03:13.144
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

60
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.870
<v Speaker 2>And that that was somehow a special time for human evolution that set our</v>

61
00:03:19.871 --> 00:03:20.704
<v Speaker 2>nature.</v>

62
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:22.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that,</v>

63
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:25.090
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

64
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's true to some degree,</v>

65
00:03:26.471 --> 00:03:31.471
<v Speaker 2>but it's more useful to view the evolution of human cognitive processes over the</v>

66
00:03:32.231 --> 00:03:36.730
<v Speaker 2>entire span of evolutionary history and not necessarily give preference to any</v>

67
00:03:36.731 --> 00:03:38.230
<v Speaker 2>particular epoch.</v>

68
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.430
<v Speaker 2>And I certainly believe that the idea that we're no longer adapted to the</v>

69
00:03:42.431 --> 00:03:45.730
<v Speaker 2>environment because of our rapid technological transformations is simply not</v>

70
00:03:45.731 --> 00:03:46.390
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>

71
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.960
<v Speaker 2>And the reason I think that it's not true is because the fundamental constants</v>

72
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.640
<v Speaker 2>of the environment,</v>

73
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:52.151
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

74
00:03:52.151 --> 00:03:55.930
<v Speaker 2>or it's more of the fundamental constitute constituent elements of being.</v>

75
00:03:55.931 --> 00:03:57.340
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the right way to think about it.</v>

76
00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:58.383
<v Speaker 2>They're the same.</v>

77
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.160
<v Speaker 2>They haven't changed a bit and there's no way of changing them as far as I can</v>

78
00:04:03.161 --> 00:04:08.161
<v Speaker 2>tell without us being radically and in comprehensively different than we are and</v>

79
00:04:08.801 --> 00:04:12.940
<v Speaker 2>you know with with the rapid rise of artificial intelligence and robotics and</v>

80
00:04:12.941 --> 00:04:13.750
<v Speaker 2>all of that,</v>

81
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.340
<v Speaker 2>it's certainly possible that in 500 years will be completely will be.</v>

82
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.440
<v Speaker 2>So like unlike the way we are now,</v>

83
00:04:20.441 --> 00:04:22.180
<v Speaker 2>that we won't even be the same creatures.</v>

84
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's a particularly great outcome,</v>

85
00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:25.570
<v Speaker 2>but it's certainly impossible.</v>

86
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.560
<v Speaker 2>So what are the fundamental constituent elements?</v>

87
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.110
<v Speaker 2>While they're expressed in mythology,</v>

88
00:04:32.111 --> 00:04:32.944
<v Speaker 2>but they're,</v>

89
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.480
<v Speaker 2>they're not merely symbolic.</v>

90
00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:36.160
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the wrong way to think about it.</v>

91
00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:37.511
<v Speaker 2>They're symbolic,</v>

92
00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:40.780
<v Speaker 2>but they reflect a very deep reality and they actually reflect the reality</v>

93
00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:44.890
<v Speaker 2>that's not easily apprehensible directly by the census.</v>

94
00:04:44.891 --> 00:04:49.210
<v Speaker 2>Now your senses are tuned for a particular duration.</v>

95
00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:50.683
<v Speaker 2>That's roughly,</v>

96
00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:51.680
<v Speaker 2>excuse me.</v>

97
00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.550
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

98
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.580
<v Speaker 2>that's roughly the duration that you live,</v>

99
00:04:57.581 --> 00:04:57.971
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>

100
00:04:57.971 --> 00:04:59.170
<v Speaker 2>But more importantly,</v>

101
00:04:59.171 --> 00:05:00.070
<v Speaker 2>it's the duration,</v>

102
00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.120
<v Speaker 2>whatever that duration is across which meaningful actions take place.</v>

103
00:05:04.121 --> 00:05:06.820
<v Speaker 2>And we kind of have some idea of what that duration is.</v>

104
00:05:06.821 --> 00:05:07.061
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

105
00:05:07.061 --> 00:05:07.930
<v Speaker 2>if you look at us,</v>

106
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.100
<v Speaker 2>a computer screen,</v>

107
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.790
<v Speaker 2>if it has a refresh rate of less than 60 hertz,</v>

108
00:05:12.791 --> 00:05:13.810
<v Speaker 2>you can see it flickering,</v>

109
00:05:13.811 --> 00:05:14.860
<v Speaker 2>but above 60 hertz,</v>

110
00:05:14.861 --> 00:05:15.311
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>

111
00:05:15.311 --> 00:05:16.000
<v Speaker 2>it's uniform.</v>

112
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.260
<v Speaker 2>And with movies,</v>

113
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.670
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

114
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:22.420
<v Speaker 2>anywhere between 20 and 50 frames a second is enough to give you the illusion of</v>

115
00:05:22.421 --> 00:05:23.410
<v Speaker 2>continual motion.</v>

116
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:24.610
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

117
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:25.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

118
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.920
<v Speaker 2>we live in a universe that's above the 10th of a second domain or maybe the</v>

119
00:05:29.921 --> 00:05:31.900
<v Speaker 2>hundredth of a second somewhere in there anyways.</v>

120
00:05:31.901 --> 00:05:32.410
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>

121
00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:37.030
<v Speaker 2>it's not like time isn't almost infinitely sub dividable at higher levels of</v>

122
00:05:37.031 --> 00:05:38.260
<v Speaker 2>resolution than that,</v>

123
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.590
<v Speaker 2>but we don't operate generally speaking at higher temporal resolution than that.</v>

124
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:45.040
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

125
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.341
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

126
00:05:45.341 --> 00:05:45.700
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

127
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.200
<v Speaker 2>we're our,</v>

128
00:05:47.201 --> 00:05:47.561
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

129
00:05:47.561 --> 00:05:48.820
<v Speaker 2>our feeling of the,</v>

130
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.950
<v Speaker 2>of the felt moment seems to be,</v>

131
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.250
<v Speaker 2>I would say something approximating half a second to a second,</v>

132
00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:55.121
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

133
00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:55.230
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

134
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.571
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

135
00:05:55.571 --> 00:05:56.710
<v Speaker 2>it's an estimate obviously,</v>

136
00:05:56.711 --> 00:06:00.800
<v Speaker 2>but the second is a meaningful unit of time for a person and a hundredth of a</v>

137
00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:03.500
<v Speaker 2>second really isn't in certainly a billionth of a second isn't.</v>

138
00:06:03.501 --> 00:06:04.334
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

139
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

140
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.150
<v Speaker 2>we can think across hours and days and weeks and months,</v>

141
00:06:08.151 --> 00:06:09.140
<v Speaker 2>but we really can't,</v>

142
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.850
<v Speaker 2>once you start getting out in two years,</v>

143
00:06:10.851 --> 00:06:14.330
<v Speaker 2>it gets kind of sketchy and it's hard to think more than five years down the</v>

144
00:06:14.331 --> 00:06:14.570
<v Speaker 2>road.</v>

145
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:18.590
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is that the particulars upon which you're basing your</v>

146
00:06:18.591 --> 00:06:22.640
<v Speaker 2>predictions are likely to change sufficiently over a five year period.</v>

147
00:06:22.641 --> 00:06:27.200
<v Speaker 2>So that extending out your vision past that just exposes you to accelerating</v>

148
00:06:27.201 --> 00:06:28.034
<v Speaker 2>error.</v>

149
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.341
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

150
00:06:28.341 --> 00:06:28.681
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>

151
00:06:28.681 --> 00:06:31.120
<v Speaker 2>and of course that's the problem with predicting the future periods.</v>

152
00:06:31.121 --> 00:06:35.030
<v Speaker 2>So we live in a time range that's about say a 10th of a second,</v>

153
00:06:35.031 --> 00:06:35.151
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

154
00:06:35.151 --> 00:06:35.540
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>

155
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:36.373
<v Speaker 2>three years,</v>

156
00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:37.251
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

157
00:06:37.251 --> 00:06:37.371
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

158
00:06:37.371 --> 00:06:38.930
<v Speaker 2>I know it can expand beyond that,</v>

159
00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:39.710
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>

160
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.670
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of where we're set and our census seem to be tuned to those</v>

161
00:06:43.671 --> 00:06:44.570
<v Speaker 2>durations and,</v>

162
00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:49.571
<v Speaker 2>and to be operative so that we make proper decisions within those durations and,</v>

163
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.070
<v Speaker 2>and also from,</v>

164
00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.050
<v Speaker 2>from a particular spacial position and so forth.</v>

165
00:06:54.051 --> 00:06:54.570
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

166
00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:56.840
<v Speaker 2>your eyes see what's roughly,</v>

167
00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:01.340
<v Speaker 2>maybe we could say a walkable distance in front of you,</v>

168
00:07:01.341 --> 00:07:02.300
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

169
00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:07.610
<v Speaker 2>So I knew didn't detect things and in the locale that enables you to immediately</v>

170
00:07:08.331 --> 00:07:09.380
<v Speaker 2>interact with things,</v>

171
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:14.810
<v Speaker 2>but it isn't necessarily the case that senses that are tuned to do that are also</v>

172
00:07:14.811 --> 00:07:19.790
<v Speaker 2>tuned to inform you directly about what the most permanent things about being</v>

173
00:07:19.791 --> 00:07:20.660
<v Speaker 2>itself are.</v>

174
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:22.940
<v Speaker 2>I think that those things have to be inferred.</v>

175
00:07:22.941 --> 00:07:23.930
<v Speaker 2>And there's some,</v>

176
00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.860
<v Speaker 2>there's some supporting evidence for that kind of thing from uh,</v>

177
00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:29.390
<v Speaker 2>from psycho linguistics.</v>

178
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:30.970
<v Speaker 2>There,</v>

179
00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:32.110
<v Speaker 2>there is a level of,</v>

180
00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:37.340
<v Speaker 2>of categorization that we seem to manifest more or less automatically or</v>

181
00:07:37.731 --> 00:07:38.361
<v Speaker 2>implicitly.</v>

182
00:07:38.361 --> 00:07:39.320
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

183
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:42.290
<v Speaker 2>when children perceive animals,</v>

184
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:42.551
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

185
00:07:42.551 --> 00:07:43.340
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

186
00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.310
<v Speaker 2>they perceive at the level of cat or dog.</v>

187
00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.353
<v Speaker 2>They don't,</v>

188
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:51.170
<v Speaker 2>they don't perceive at the level of subspecies like Siamese cat or,</v>

189
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:51.891
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

190
00:07:51.891 --> 00:07:52.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

191
00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:52.701
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

192
00:07:52.701 --> 00:07:53.090
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

193
00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:53.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

194
00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:54.620
<v Speaker 2>let's say salmonoid,</v>

195
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:55.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

196
00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:55.700
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

197
00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:56.420
<v Speaker 2>there's this,</v>

198
00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:57.260
<v Speaker 2>there's a natural,</v>

199
00:07:57.261 --> 00:07:59.450
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember what they call that base category,</v>

200
00:07:59.451 --> 00:08:00.081
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

201
00:08:00.081 --> 00:08:03.170
<v Speaker 2>It's usually specified by very short words that are easily learnable.</v>

202
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.230
<v Speaker 2>And so the linguistic system seems to map right onto the,</v>

203
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.390
<v Speaker 2>to the object recognition,</v>

204
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:13.160
<v Speaker 2>po characteristics of the sensory systems that are built right into it.</v>

205
00:08:13.161 --> 00:08:13.640
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

206
00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:14.870
<v Speaker 2>and if they weren't built into it,</v>

207
00:08:14.871 --> 00:08:17.390
<v Speaker 2>we couldn't communicate easily because our natural categories,</v>

208
00:08:17.391 --> 00:08:18.110
<v Speaker 2>I think that's it,</v>

209
00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:19.160
<v Speaker 2>but it's probably wrong.</v>

210
00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:20.570
<v Speaker 2>Our natural categories,</v>

211
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:24.440
<v Speaker 2>they have to be the same for everyone or it would be very difficult for us to</v>

212
00:08:24.441 --> 00:08:25.274
<v Speaker 2>communicate.</v>

213
00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:25.761
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

214
00:08:25.761 --> 00:08:27.590
<v Speaker 2>So having said all that,</v>

215
00:08:27.591 --> 00:08:28.550
<v Speaker 2>then the question is,</v>

216
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:29.601
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

217
00:08:29.601 --> 00:08:30.530
<v Speaker 2>what are the most,</v>

218
00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:33.950
<v Speaker 2>what are the most real categories?</v>

219
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:35.800
<v Speaker 2>And I think there's,</v>

220
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:39.500
<v Speaker 2>there's a real division in ways to think about this because there's a scientific</v>

221
00:08:39.501 --> 00:08:40.550
<v Speaker 2>way of thinking about it.</v>

222
00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:41.540
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

223
00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:42.450
<v Speaker 2>and in,</v>

224
00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:43.161
<v Speaker 2>in that case,</v>

225
00:08:43.161 --> 00:08:44.930
<v Speaker 2>the most real categories are,</v>

226
00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:49.780
<v Speaker 2>well mathematical equation certainly seemed to be in the top category there,</v>

227
00:08:49.781 --> 00:08:52.700
<v Speaker 2>their equations that describe the physical universe,</v>

228
00:08:52.701 --> 00:08:57.701
<v Speaker 2>but then then the hypothesis of the existence of such things as protons and</v>

229
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:00.920
<v Speaker 2>electrons and you know,</v>

230
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:01.280
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

231
00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:01.950
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

232
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:04.200
<v Speaker 2>the material elements that make up everything.</v>

233
00:09:04.201 --> 00:09:09.120
<v Speaker 2>That's every element of being with the possible exception of empty space.</v>

234
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:10.423
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

235
00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:12.120
<v Speaker 2>but in the,</v>

236
00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.680
<v Speaker 2>in the mythological world,</v>

237
00:09:13.681 --> 00:09:18.681
<v Speaker 2>the categories I think are more derived from Darwinian by the effect of</v>

238
00:09:19.891 --> 00:09:22.860
<v Speaker 2>Darwinian processes on cognitive and perceptual function.</v>

239
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:28.140
<v Speaker 2>So which is to say that we have learned to perceive and then to infer those</v>

240
00:09:28.141 --> 00:09:31.830
<v Speaker 2>things that are most necessary for us in order to continue our existence,</v>

241
00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:33.420
<v Speaker 2>propagate live well,</v>

242
00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:34.290
<v Speaker 2>all of those things.</v>

243
00:09:34.291 --> 00:09:37.170
<v Speaker 2>And that would be true at the level of individual survival.</v>

244
00:09:37.171 --> 00:09:39.210
<v Speaker 2>And maybe it's also true at the level of group survival,</v>

245
00:09:39.211 --> 00:09:40.590
<v Speaker 2>although you know the,</v>

246
00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:44.370
<v Speaker 2>there's a tremendous debate among evolutionary biologists about whether or not</v>

247
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.770
<v Speaker 2>selection can take place at the level of the group.</v>

248
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.433
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

249
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.650
<v Speaker 2>there are these basic level categories that manifest themselves to you.</v>

250
00:09:52.651 --> 00:09:56.850
<v Speaker 2>And then there's categories of the imagination that you have to infer up from</v>

251
00:09:56.851 --> 00:09:57.900
<v Speaker 2>the sensory domain.</v>

252
00:09:57.901 --> 00:10:02.901
<v Speaker 2>And we do that partly in science by comparing our sensory representations across</v>

253
00:10:03.601 --> 00:10:04.320
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

254
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.480
<v Speaker 2>But we also do it by thinking abstractly,</v>

255
00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:08.010
<v Speaker 2>conceptualizing abstractly.</v>

256
00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:09.203
<v Speaker 2>And no,</v>

257
00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:11.740
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that's interesting about abstractions,</v>

258
00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.850
<v Speaker 2>it's not clear whether they're more or less real than the things they're</v>

259
00:10:14.851 --> 00:10:15.840
<v Speaker 2>obstructed from.</v>

260
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:16.720
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

261
00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.990
<v Speaker 2>this is a perennial debate among,</v>

262
00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:23.550
<v Speaker 2>let's call them ontologists who were interested in that fundamental fundamental</v>

263
00:10:23.551 --> 00:10:25.050
<v Speaker 2>nature of reality itself.</v>

264
00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:26.341
<v Speaker 2>In some sense,</v>

265
00:10:26.341 --> 00:10:28.200
<v Speaker 2>independent of conceptual structures.</v>

266
00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:31.230
<v Speaker 2>Our numbers more or less real than the things they represent.</v>

267
00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:36.950
<v Speaker 2>It's a really hard question to answer because knowing like using numbers as a</v>

268
00:10:37.981 --> 00:10:40.920
<v Speaker 2>representational system gives you unbelievable power.</v>

269
00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:44.220
<v Speaker 2>And there are mathematicians that believe that there isn't anything more real</v>

270
00:10:44.221 --> 00:10:45.840
<v Speaker 2>than mathematical representations.</v>

271
00:10:45.841 --> 00:10:49.170
<v Speaker 2>Now it depends to some degree of course on how you classify reality.</v>

272
00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:53.310
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem with a question like is a uh,</v>

273
00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.980
<v Speaker 2>equivalent to be the answer to that always is,</v>

274
00:10:55.981 --> 00:10:57.390
<v Speaker 2>well it depends on how you define a,</v>

275
00:10:57.391 --> 00:10:59.000
<v Speaker 2>and it depends on how you define be.</v>

276
00:10:59.001 --> 00:11:01.320
<v Speaker 2>So generally it's not a very useful question,</v>

277
00:11:01.321 --> 00:11:04.920
<v Speaker 2>but you can still get the point that there's something very real about</v>

278
00:11:04.921 --> 00:11:07.410
<v Speaker 2>abstractions incredibly real.</v>

279
00:11:07.411 --> 00:11:09.270
<v Speaker 2>Because otherwise why would you bother with them?</v>

280
00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:11.040
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't give you any handle on the world.</v>

281
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:12.233
<v Speaker 2>So what's the,</v>

282
00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:15.090
<v Speaker 2>what's the most useful or what's the most,</v>

283
00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:20.420
<v Speaker 2>what's the broadest possible level of abstraction and is there any use of any</v>

284
00:11:20.731 --> 00:11:22.410
<v Speaker 2>utility in thinking in that manner?</v>

285
00:11:22.411 --> 00:11:25.440
<v Speaker 2>And I tried to make the case last time that,</v>

286
00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:30.570
<v Speaker 2>that in the mythological world there are three categories or four depending on</v>

287
00:11:30.571 --> 00:11:32.730
<v Speaker 2>what you do with the strange fourth category.</v>

288
00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:37.830
<v Speaker 2>Cause the fourth category is sort of the category of uncategorizable entities.</v>

289
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:42.000
<v Speaker 2>And so it's sort of the category of everything that not only do you not know,</v>

290
00:11:42.001 --> 00:11:42.691
<v Speaker 2>but you don't know,</v>

291
00:11:42.691 --> 00:11:43.890
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what it's it's,</v>

292
00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.740
<v Speaker 2>or you can think about it as the category of potential.</v>

293
00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:50.940
<v Speaker 2>I actually think that's the best way to think about it is that it's the dragon</v>

294
00:11:50.941 --> 00:11:53.040
<v Speaker 2>of chaos is the category of potential.</v>

295
00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:55.570
<v Speaker 2>And I do believe that we're,</v>

296
00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:57.910
<v Speaker 2>our materialist view is essentially wrong.</v>

297
00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:00.010
<v Speaker 2>I think that the proper way of looking at the,</v>

298
00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:04.330
<v Speaker 2>at beings that being his potential and from that potential,</v>

299
00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:09.190
<v Speaker 2>whatever consciousness is extracts out the reality that we inhabit anyways.</v>

300
00:12:09.191 --> 00:12:11.360
<v Speaker 2>That's certainly the mythological viewpoint and,</v>

301
00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.050
<v Speaker 2>but it's not just a mythological viewpoint.</v>

302
00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:14.210
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

303
00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:14.340
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

304
00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:14.681
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>

305
00:12:14.681 --> 00:12:15.130
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

306
00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:16.900
<v Speaker 2>it's a sequence of ideas,</v>

307
00:12:16.901 --> 00:12:17.471
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

308
00:12:17.471 --> 00:12:21.010
<v Speaker 2>that deeply underlies the thinking of John Piaget and Piaget.</v>

309
00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:21.551
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

310
00:12:21.551 --> 00:12:25.240
<v Speaker 2>it was very interested in reconciling the gap between religion and science.</v>

311
00:12:25.241 --> 00:12:27.190
<v Speaker 2>That's really what he devoted his life to doing.</v>

312
00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:28.300
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

313
00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:30.970
<v Speaker 2>and there are other streams of philosophy and I would say high digger that</v>

314
00:12:30.971 --> 00:12:32.710
<v Speaker 2>phenomenologists are,</v>

315
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:37.030
<v Speaker 2>are thinking along lines that are similar to this as well because Heidegger was</v>

316
00:12:37.031 --> 00:12:39.220
<v Speaker 2>concerned not with the nature of material reality,</v>

317
00:12:39.221 --> 00:12:40.840
<v Speaker 2>but with being as such.</v>

318
00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:46.460
<v Speaker 2>And so you can extract out the viewpoint that I just described from mythology,</v>

319
00:12:48.011 --> 00:12:50.290
<v Speaker 2>but it isn't the only source of such,</v>

320
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:51.543
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

321
00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:52.383
<v Speaker 2>what would you call it?</v>

322
00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:53.463
<v Speaker 2>A</v>

323
00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:58.090
<v Speaker 2>hypotheses is probably the right idea.</v>

324
00:12:58.091 --> 00:12:58.381
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

325
00:12:58.381 --> 00:12:59.214
<v Speaker 2>so the idea,</v>

326
00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:02.740
<v Speaker 2>you can think about this as a bootstrapping process in some senses,</v>

327
00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:04.720
<v Speaker 2>in order for anything to get going,</v>

328
00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:09.010
<v Speaker 2>it has to bootstrap itself up and become more and more complex as it does that.</v>

329
00:13:09.011 --> 00:13:09.490
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

330
00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:12.160
<v Speaker 2>it's like this is the answer to the chicken and egg problem,</v>

331
00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:12.820
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

332
00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:16.720
<v Speaker 2>Which was first the chicken or the egg while neither something from which both</v>

333
00:13:16.721 --> 00:13:18.160
<v Speaker 2>the chicken and egg were derived.</v>

334
00:13:18.161 --> 00:13:18.610
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

335
00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:19.480
<v Speaker 2>Cause the ultimate,</v>

336
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:22.840
<v Speaker 2>the ultimate answer to that is the answer to how there are things at all,</v>

337
00:13:22.841 --> 00:13:23.650
<v Speaker 2>who knows?</v>

338
00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:26.140
<v Speaker 2>But at some point there were neither chickens nor eggs,</v>

339
00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:28.930
<v Speaker 2>but there were the things that were the precursors to those things.</v>

340
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:33.040
<v Speaker 2>And so they spiraled upwards in some sense.</v>

341
00:13:33.041 --> 00:13:33.490
<v Speaker 2>And those,</v>

342
00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:33.790
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

343
00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:34.623
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

344
00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:35.643
<v Speaker 2>initial,</v>

345
00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:36.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

346
00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.360
<v Speaker 2>prodo entities,</v>

347
00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:38.770
<v Speaker 2>single celled animals for,</v>

348
00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:41.080
<v Speaker 2>we need to go back farther than that.</v>

349
00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:41.651
<v Speaker 2>But we could say,</v>

350
00:13:41.651 --> 00:13:41.801
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

351
00:13:41.801 --> 00:13:44.650
<v Speaker 2>single cell animals differentiated over time.</v>

352
00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:45.041
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

353
00:13:45.041 --> 00:13:48.590
<v Speaker 2>And there's this looping process that,</v>

354
00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:51.280
<v Speaker 2>that differentiates out into both the chicken and the egg.</v>

355
00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:52.563
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

356
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:53.830
<v Speaker 2>but the question is,</v>

357
00:13:53.831 --> 00:13:56.080
<v Speaker 2>what do you need in order for that process to begin?</v>

358
00:13:57.130 --> 00:14:00.160
<v Speaker 2>And that's really the question of what the fundamental constituent elements of</v>

359
00:14:00.161 --> 00:14:01.000
<v Speaker 2>reality are.</v>

360
00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:04.690
<v Speaker 2>And the mythological hypothesis is that there's are three or four.</v>

361
00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:08.230
<v Speaker 2>One is the fact that there has to be something that,</v>

362
00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:09.070
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

363
00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:11.800
<v Speaker 2>that that manifests itself as an observer.</v>

364
00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:12.940
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that,</v>

365
00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:18.150
<v Speaker 2>some kind of observer now where that process of observation starts in the Fila</v>

366
00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:19.540
<v Speaker 2>genetic chain is very,</v>

367
00:14:19.541 --> 00:14:21.250
<v Speaker 2>very difficult to tell.</v>

368
00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:21.941
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

369
00:14:21.941 --> 00:14:22.481
<v Speaker 2>we might say,</v>

370
00:14:22.481 --> 00:14:22.631
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

371
00:14:22.631 --> 00:14:23.464
<v Speaker 2>there's certainly nothing,</v>

372
00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:27.100
<v Speaker 2>no possibility of a conscious observer until there's a differentiated nervous</v>

373
00:14:27.101 --> 00:14:27.820
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

374
00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:30.940
<v Speaker 2>But then prior to the emergence of differentiated nervous systems,</v>

375
00:14:30.941 --> 00:14:35.380
<v Speaker 2>there were animals that were complex enough to react with the environment in a</v>

376
00:14:35.381 --> 00:14:36.100
<v Speaker 2>manner that,</v>

377
00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:36.341
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

378
00:14:36.341 --> 00:14:37.360
<v Speaker 2>single celled animals,</v>

379
00:14:37.361 --> 00:14:38.350
<v Speaker 2>they're quite complex.</v>

380
00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:38.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

381
00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:40.600
<v Speaker 2>some of them are unbelievably complicated.</v>

382
00:14:40.601 --> 00:14:40.811
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

383
00:14:40.811 --> 00:14:42.640
<v Speaker 2>they can move themselves through space,</v>

384
00:14:42.641 --> 00:14:43.271
<v Speaker 2>they can orient,</v>

385
00:14:43.271 --> 00:14:44.710
<v Speaker 2>they can follow chemical trails.</v>

386
00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:45.550
<v Speaker 2>They're not,</v>

387
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:48.070
<v Speaker 2>they're not stupid by any stretch of the imagination.</v>

388
00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:52.220
<v Speaker 2>Now to what degree they have big,</v>

389
00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:52.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

390
00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:54.290
<v Speaker 2>as something that can represent,</v>

391
00:14:54.291 --> 00:14:55.970
<v Speaker 2>well we don't have to speculate on that,</v>

392
00:14:55.971 --> 00:14:58.100
<v Speaker 2>but the prodo elements of,</v>

393
00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:00.200
<v Speaker 2>of conscious being are there.</v>

394
00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:01.483
<v Speaker 2>So you need,</v>

395
00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:02.990
<v Speaker 2>you need a being,</v>

396
00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.890
<v Speaker 2>you need that.</v>

397
00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:07.610
<v Speaker 2>The structure of that being through which the,</v>

398
00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:13.570
<v Speaker 2>the entirety of being itself is interpreted and you need the surround.</v>

399
00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:15.080
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>

400
00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:19.520
<v Speaker 2>And so I conceptualize that as something that knows that's the knower,</v>

401
00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.380
<v Speaker 2>what it knows.</v>

402
00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:26.450
<v Speaker 2>That's the interpretive structure and that which needs to be known or you could</v>

403
00:15:26.691 --> 00:15:26.930
<v Speaker 2>come,</v>

404
00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:31.930
<v Speaker 2>you could conceptualize that as the individual in explored territory,</v>

405
00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.600
<v Speaker 2>nested inside unexplored territory.</v>

406
00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.100
<v Speaker 2>That's another way of thinking about it.</v>

407
00:15:37.101 --> 00:15:42.101
<v Speaker 2>Or you can think about it as the individual inside culture and the individual</v>

408
00:15:42.171 --> 00:15:44.030
<v Speaker 2>culture has nested inside nature.</v>

409
00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:45.410
<v Speaker 2>That's another way of looking at it.</v>

410
00:15:45.411 --> 00:15:50.411
<v Speaker 2>Or you can think of as the knower and in order surrounded by chaos.</v>

411
00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:52.430
<v Speaker 2>That's another way of thinking about it.</v>

412
00:15:52.431 --> 00:15:53.300
<v Speaker 2>But all these things,</v>

413
00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:53.811
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

414
00:15:53.811 --> 00:15:57.920
<v Speaker 2>they're all attempts to articulate the same underlying structure.</v>
