1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:00.381
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2
00:00:00.381 --> 00:00:01.131
<v Speaker 1>So that's a good,</v>

3
00:00:01.131 --> 00:00:02.450
<v Speaker 1>that's a good place to go next.</v>

4
00:00:02.451 --> 00:00:06.080
<v Speaker 1>So you laid out a whole slew of reasons,</v>

5
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.730
<v Speaker 1>a slew of consequences of fatherlessness and we'll return back to the causal</v>

6
00:00:10.731 --> 00:00:14.210
<v Speaker 1>relationship between men do and these beneficial outcomes.</v>

7
00:00:14.211 --> 00:00:19.211
<v Speaker 1>But if you could go on now to tell us what it is that men are doing at a micro</v>

8
00:00:19.521 --> 00:00:19.821
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>

9
00:00:19.821 --> 00:00:23.420
<v Speaker 1>then we could return to the causal link between that and the positive outcomes.</v>

10
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.380
<v Speaker 1>And you said those also caused some contention in the household?</v>

11
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.501
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

12
00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:28.790
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

13
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:29.750
<v Speaker 2>give one example,</v>

14
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.593
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

15
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.513
<v Speaker 2>will it be</v>

16
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.200
<v Speaker 2>father is rough housing with the kids and the moms looking over and saying,</v>

17
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.240
<v Speaker 2>looking at scans and thinking,</v>

18
00:00:39.241 --> 00:00:39.571
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

19
00:00:39.571 --> 00:00:40.560
<v Speaker 2>when should I interfere?</v>

20
00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:41.490
<v Speaker 2>When should I not interfere?</v>

21
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.200
<v Speaker 2>And the mom saying herself,</v>

22
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:45.683
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy,</v>

23
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:46.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

24
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.340
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

25
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.010
<v Speaker 2>please keep the kids away from the,</v>

26
00:00:49.011 --> 00:00:49.920
<v Speaker 2>the credenza there,</v>

27
00:00:49.921 --> 00:00:50.161
<v Speaker 2>Pete,</v>

28
00:00:50.161 --> 00:00:52.900
<v Speaker 2>that gets away from the couch because they could hit their head there.</v>

29
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.900
<v Speaker 2>Why did she wait?</v>

30
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.350
<v Speaker 2>They to tomorrow when you can take this outside.</v>

31
00:00:58.351 --> 00:00:59.750
<v Speaker 2>I feel much safer with the kids shit.</v>

32
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.650
<v Speaker 2>And then the mother is sort of hesitating to not be overly controlling.</v>

33
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.650
<v Speaker 2>And yet at the same time she's feeling she has to monitor.</v>

34
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:08.400
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

35
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.630
<v Speaker 2>the husband is bell as monitor the husband with the kids and she's feeling in</v>

36
00:01:12.631 --> 00:01:13.470
<v Speaker 2>the back of your mind,</v>

37
00:01:13.471 --> 00:01:14.650
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>

38
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.390
<v Speaker 2>sooner or later there's going to be a myth.</v>

39
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.190
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be an accident here and I'm going to be upset with myself for</v>

40
00:01:20.191 --> 00:01:21.330
<v Speaker 2>not being stricter.</v>

41
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.620
<v Speaker 2>But on the other hand,</v>

42
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.940
<v Speaker 2>the kids seem to be having fun,</v>

43
00:01:23.941 --> 00:01:25.110
<v Speaker 2>so I should let things go.</v>

44
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.451
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

45
00:01:25.451 --> 00:01:25.721
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

46
00:01:25.721 --> 00:01:26.554
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

47
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.610
<v Speaker 1>there's a cycle biologist named Jaak Panksepp who was one of the world's great</v>

48
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.700
<v Speaker 1>biological psychologists and he studied rough and tumble play in animals.</v>

49
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:37.691
<v Speaker 1>So rats,</v>

50
00:01:37.691 --> 00:01:38.560
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

51
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:39.810
<v Speaker 1>a huge part of the,</v>

52
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.960
<v Speaker 1>the socialization process that's key to the development of the prefrontal cortex</v>

53
00:01:45.041 --> 00:01:49.660
<v Speaker 1>in juvenile male routes in particular emerges and matures as a consequence of</v>

54
00:01:49.661 --> 00:01:50.680
<v Speaker 1>rough and tumble play.</v>

55
00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.740
<v Speaker 1>And one of the amazing things that Panksepp discovered it,</v>

56
00:01:53.741 --> 00:01:55.390
<v Speaker 1>and this truly is an amazing thing,</v>

57
00:01:55.391 --> 00:01:56.224
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>

58
00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.363
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

59
00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.120
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

60
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.120
<v Speaker 1>if you pair two rats together and then let them play repeated bouts,</v>

61
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.800
<v Speaker 1>the big route will dominate the little route to begin with in the first bout.</v>

62
00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.720
<v Speaker 1>But if the big rat doesn't let the little rat win about 30% of the time in</v>

63
00:02:13.721 --> 00:02:14.770
<v Speaker 1>repeated play boats,</v>

64
00:02:14.771 --> 00:02:16.510
<v Speaker 1>then the little rap won't play anymore.</v>

65
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.120
<v Speaker 1>So you get an emergent morality in emergent plays,</v>

66
00:02:20.121 --> 00:02:21.160
<v Speaker 1>centered morality,</v>

67
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.280
<v Speaker 1>even among rats as a consequence of rough and tumble play.</v>

68
00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.720
<v Speaker 1>And that rough and tumble,</v>

69
00:02:25.721 --> 00:02:28.090
<v Speaker 1>I did a fair bit of research on rough and tumble play about,</v>

70
00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.130
<v Speaker 1>oh it's probably 20 years ago now,</v>

71
00:02:30.131 --> 00:02:31.390
<v Speaker 1>15 years ago anyways.</v>

72
00:02:31.391 --> 00:02:35.560
<v Speaker 1>And it's really quite clear that rough and tumble play helps children</v>

73
00:02:35.561 --> 00:02:39.250
<v Speaker 1>parameterize their bodies so that they know how they extend and,</v>

74
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.790
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

75
00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.090
<v Speaker 1>and also what limits the reason,</v>

76
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.650
<v Speaker 1>the use of physical interactions with another person.</v>

77
00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:45.790
<v Speaker 1>What's fun,</v>

78
00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.020
<v Speaker 1>what's provocative,</v>

79
00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.700
<v Speaker 1>what's pushing it too far,</v>

80
00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:50.620
<v Speaker 1>what's painful.</v>

81
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.560
<v Speaker 1>And of course kids love rough and tumble play as well.</v>

82
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:54.020
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

83
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.900
<v Speaker 1>they're just absolutely starving for it.</v>

84
00:02:55.901 --> 00:02:58.330
<v Speaker 1>And we've squeezed it out of the kindergartens,</v>

85
00:02:58.331 --> 00:02:59.164
<v Speaker 1>the nursery,</v>

86
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.490
<v Speaker 1>the elementary schools,</v>

87
00:03:00.491 --> 00:03:01.540
<v Speaker 1>the junior high schools,</v>

88
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.520
<v Speaker 1>all of that and for and for bid.</v>

89
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.560
<v Speaker 1>And what Panksepp also found was that if you deprived juvenile routes,</v>

90
00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:11.680
<v Speaker 1>have the opportunity to engage in active rough and tumble play,</v>

91
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.330
<v Speaker 1>that they showed symptoms that were broadly analogous to those of attention</v>

92
00:03:16.331 --> 00:03:21.331
<v Speaker 1>deficit disorder in human boys and that you could also treat that with Ritalin</v>

93
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.130
<v Speaker 1>the same way in routes as you could with boys.</v>

94
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.710
<v Speaker 1>So there's that rough and tumble play issue.</v>

95
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:27.071
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

96
00:03:27.071 --> 00:03:32.071
<v Speaker 1>and you might think to the question is one question is why might a mother be</v>

97
00:03:33.191 --> 00:03:36.880
<v Speaker 1>distrustful of the rough and tumble play episode?</v>

98
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.810
<v Speaker 1>And some of that might be sensitivity re with regards to the kids,</v>

99
00:03:40.811 --> 00:03:45.811
<v Speaker 1>but huge part of that also is trust on her trust with regards to the father.</v>

100
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.841
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

101
00:03:46.841 --> 00:03:48.580
<v Speaker 1>cause it's rambunctious and noisy.</v>

102
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.110
<v Speaker 1>And if she trusts,</v>

103
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.760
<v Speaker 1>let's say that that act of masculinity that plays rough,</v>

104
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.490
<v Speaker 1>then she'll stay away and let the fund happen.</v>

105
00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.860
<v Speaker 1>But if there's distrust running through the family,</v>

106
00:03:59.861 --> 00:04:04.600
<v Speaker 1>then then she'll stand between the kids and the father and then he won't get to</v>

107
00:04:04.601 --> 00:04:07.450
<v Speaker 1>involve himself in that way and then he'll turn off.</v>

108
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.950
<v Speaker 1>And I've seen that happen many,</v>

109
00:04:08.951 --> 00:04:09.850
<v Speaker 1>many families.</v>

110
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.481
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

111
00:04:10.481 --> 00:04:11.800
<v Speaker 1>so there's rough and tumble play.</v>

112
00:04:11.801 --> 00:04:12.700
<v Speaker 1>That's a big one.</v>

113
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:13.531
<v Speaker 1>What else is,</v>

114
00:04:13.531 --> 00:04:14.410
<v Speaker 1>what else do you see?</v>

115
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:15.521
<v Speaker 2>Let me take the,</v>

116
00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:18.510
<v Speaker 2>the evolution and how rough and tumble play goes and all the,</v>

117
00:04:18.511 --> 00:04:18.711
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

118
00:04:18.711 --> 00:04:21.780
<v Speaker 2>the dimensions of where the slippery slope that it leads to.</v>

119
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.330
<v Speaker 2>So the father,</v>

120
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.040
<v Speaker 2>the what the mom,</v>

121
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.910
<v Speaker 2>either the mom or the dad knew is that this rough and tumble play leads to the</v>

122
00:04:30.911 --> 00:04:32.590
<v Speaker 2>types of things that you just mentioned,</v>

123
00:04:32.591 --> 00:04:33.760
<v Speaker 2>but you're also evident in,</v>

124
00:04:33.761 --> 00:04:34.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

125
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.290
<v Speaker 2>an elephants and so on.</v>

126
00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.940
<v Speaker 2>But it also leads to the distinction between a child being able to distinguish</v>

127
00:04:39.941 --> 00:04:41.770
<v Speaker 2>between being assertive versus aggressive.</v>

128
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.620
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

129
00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:43.610
<v Speaker 2>so the kid starts,</v>

130
00:04:43.611 --> 00:04:44.151
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

131
00:04:44.151 --> 00:04:44.810
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>

132
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.960
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

133
00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.530
<v Speaker 2>kicking the dad and the of the wrong place or poking the data and the eyes are</v>

134
00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.300
<v Speaker 2>pulling the dad's hair and the dad says,</v>

135
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:51.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm sweetie,</v>

136
00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.280
<v Speaker 2>you can fake,</v>

137
00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.203
<v Speaker 2>you can fake it.</v>

138
00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.010
<v Speaker 2>I contacted the left and then move to the right to win in this wrestling match.</v>

139
00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.060
<v Speaker 2>Or you can,</v>

140
00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.360
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

141
00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

142
00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:59.171
<v Speaker 2>you can do this,</v>

143
00:04:59.171 --> 00:05:00.004
<v Speaker 2>this and this,</v>

144
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.750
<v Speaker 2>but you can't do these things.</v>

145
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.390
<v Speaker 2>And if you do do these things that will stop</v>

146
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:05.403
<v Speaker 1>the rough housing.</v>

147
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.741
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

148
00:05:05.741 --> 00:05:06.221
<v Speaker 1>So there,</v>

149
00:05:06.221 --> 00:05:08.050
<v Speaker 1>so there is a really important issue there.</v>

150
00:05:08.051 --> 00:05:09.130
<v Speaker 1>So two things there.</v>

151
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:10.330
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that,</v>

152
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.200
<v Speaker 1>imagine that a rough and tumble boat is like a dance.</v>

153
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.440
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

154
00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.030
<v Speaker 1>And the point of the dances so that both people are having a good time while</v>

155
00:05:19.031 --> 00:05:22.000
<v Speaker 1>it's happening because otherwise it's not play right.</v>

156
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.390
<v Speaker 1>And as soon as either party is no longer having a good time,</v>

157
00:05:25.391 --> 00:05:28.930
<v Speaker 1>you've actually snapped out of the cycle biological function of the play</v>

158
00:05:28.931 --> 00:05:29.764
<v Speaker 1>circuit.</v>

159
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.000
<v Speaker 1>So basically what you're telling the child by putting those rules on is we can</v>

160
00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:38.530
<v Speaker 1>interact physically within a very limited set of parameters and you,</v>

161
00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:43.300
<v Speaker 1>what you have to learn to do is to be sophist a sophisticated player within that</v>

162
00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:44.134
<v Speaker 1>set of parameters.</v>

163
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.270
<v Speaker 1>And you want to learn how to push the boundaries,</v>

164
00:05:46.271 --> 00:05:46.511
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

165
00:05:46.511 --> 00:05:47.770
<v Speaker 1>Because the most fun,</v>

166
00:05:47.771 --> 00:05:51.190
<v Speaker 1>rough and tumble play is right on the edge between assertiveness.</v>

167
00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:52.023
<v Speaker 1>And aggression,</v>

168
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

169
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.840
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

170
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:53.980
<v Speaker 1>and you can see kids,</v>

171
00:05:53.981 --> 00:05:58.981
<v Speaker 1>like I used to work in daycare centers when I was a kid when I was 1819 and the</v>

172
00:05:59.121 --> 00:06:02.270
<v Speaker 1>kids would line up to rough and tumble play with me because that was still</v>

173
00:06:02.271 --> 00:06:02.901
<v Speaker 1>allowable then.</v>

174
00:06:02.901 --> 00:06:04.190
<v Speaker 1>And they were so desperate for it.</v>

175
00:06:04.191 --> 00:06:05.330
<v Speaker 1>It was just ridiculous.</v>

176
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:10.100
<v Speaker 1>And I could really tell the difference between the kids who had engaged in that</v>

177
00:06:10.101 --> 00:06:11.690
<v Speaker 1>sort of play and the ones that hadn't.</v>

178
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:12.980
<v Speaker 1>And the ones that hadn't,</v>

179
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:17.180
<v Speaker 1>we're painfully awkward and they would hurt themselves.</v>

180
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.021
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>

181
00:06:18.021 --> 00:06:18.980
<v Speaker 1>when you wrestled with them,</v>

182
00:06:18.981 --> 00:06:20.480
<v Speaker 1>they'd put their thumb in your eye or,</v>

183
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.500
<v Speaker 1>and they would cry often too when they got surprised but not hurt,</v>

184
00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.311
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

185
00:06:25.311 --> 00:06:28.880
<v Speaker 1>because they couldn't tell the difference between just being startled and being</v>

186
00:06:28.881 --> 00:06:29.450
<v Speaker 1>hurt.</v>

187
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:30.620
<v Speaker 1>And so they were fragile.</v>

188
00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:32.810
<v Speaker 1>And that also made them not fun to play with.</v>

189
00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.310
<v Speaker 1>And the thing that's so interesting about that too is Piaget talked about this</v>

190
00:06:37.311 --> 00:06:39.380
<v Speaker 1>when he talked about the development of children is that,</v>

191
00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:40.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

192
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.400
<v Speaker 1>the more sophisticated pretend play and then sophisticated cognitive player that</v>

193
00:06:46.311 --> 00:06:48.710
<v Speaker 1>emerges say between five and seven.</v>

194
00:06:48.711 --> 00:06:52.310
<v Speaker 1>And then with the cognitive play older than that is that unless you have that</v>

195
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:56.930
<v Speaker 1>underlying psychomotor embodied dance down,</v>

196
00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:01.940
<v Speaker 1>you don't get to really proceed in a sophisticated way to those higher levels of</v>

197
00:07:01.941 --> 00:07:04.160
<v Speaker 1>play because other people don't want to play with you.</v>

198
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:07.220
<v Speaker 1>So the rough and tumble play,</v>

199
00:07:07.221 --> 00:07:09.380
<v Speaker 1>the importance of that can hardly be overstated.</v>

200
00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:10.260
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

201
00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:10.720
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

202
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:10.860
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

203
00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:15.860
<v Speaker 2>and the framework here is that when you set up a system where you said that men</v>

204
00:07:15.961 --> 00:07:17.250
<v Speaker 2>are part of the patriarchy,</v>

205
00:07:17.251 --> 00:07:17.870
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

206
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:18.120
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

207
00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:18.451
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

208
00:07:18.451 --> 00:07:21.990
<v Speaker 2>their desire is to dominate women and make rules to benefit at the expense of</v>

209
00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:25.260
<v Speaker 2>them at the benefit men at the expense of women.</v>

210
00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.610
<v Speaker 2>You have a framework,</v>

211
00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.440
<v Speaker 2>an emotional setting,</v>

212
00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:29.730
<v Speaker 2>which does not,</v>

213
00:07:29.731 --> 00:07:31.620
<v Speaker 2>is not conducive then saying,</v>

214
00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.950
<v Speaker 2>here's my value or women saying,</v>

215
00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:39.570
<v Speaker 2>let me see what the checks and balances of parenting is that leads to the best</v>

216
00:07:39.571 --> 00:07:41.610
<v Speaker 2>of you coming out in the best of me coming out,</v>

217
00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:46.940
<v Speaker 2>all of that has said we skipped over and inherent sense of father knows best to</v>

218
00:07:47.941 --> 00:07:48.990
<v Speaker 2>father knows less.</v>

219
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:49.730
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

220
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:50.130
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

221
00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:50.730
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

222
00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:51.210
<v Speaker 2>and we've,</v>

223
00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:51.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

224
00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:53.230
<v Speaker 2>and so the,</v>

225
00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:53.830
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

226
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:54.130
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

227
00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:58.720
<v Speaker 2>the process that I'll be sharing in a moment of what rough housing leads to and</v>

228
00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.140
<v Speaker 2>the slippery slope that happens when it doesn't happen,</v>

229
00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:01.800
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

230
00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.250
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

231
00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:07.250
<v Speaker 2>is what is not even been nurtured as a possibility to be articulated in this</v>

232
00:08:07.501 --> 00:08:08.210
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>

233
00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:09.200
<v Speaker 1>I also think too,</v>

234
00:08:09.201 --> 00:08:09.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

235
00:08:09.501 --> 00:08:10.570
<v Speaker 1>that if you have a,</v>

236
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.150
<v Speaker 1>a partner who hasn't been played with,</v>

237
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:20.170
<v Speaker 1>then that partner can't tell the difference between Boisterous rambunctiousness</v>

238
00:08:20.181 --> 00:08:21.020
<v Speaker 1>and aggression.</v>

239
00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:26.360
<v Speaker 1>And if there's a hypothesis about domination and the patriarchy running its</v>

240
00:08:26.361 --> 00:08:27.560
<v Speaker 1>course underneath that,</v>

241
00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:31.490
<v Speaker 1>then there's going to be conceptual confusion about the physical interactions</v>

242
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:35.540
<v Speaker 1>that have the appearance of submission and dominance because that's part of the</v>

243
00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:37.610
<v Speaker 1>rough housing play routine.</v>

244
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:41.480
<v Speaker 1>It's going to that that is going to be viewed through a lens of tyrannical</v>

245
00:08:41.481 --> 00:08:44.240
<v Speaker 1>interaction rather than just good fun.</v>

246
00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:48.380
<v Speaker 1>And I mean you can tell the difference because if the kids are rough and tumble</v>

247
00:08:48.381 --> 00:08:49.010
<v Speaker 1>playing,</v>

248
00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:53.960
<v Speaker 1>they're unbelievably enthusiastic about it and engaged and laughing and giggling</v>

249
00:08:53.961 --> 00:08:57.390
<v Speaker 1>and like they'll play to the point of exhaustion because they need it.</v>

250
00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:58.620
<v Speaker 1>They need it so much.</v>

251
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.670
<v Speaker 1>But that's a hard thing to observe from the outside if you're not accustomed to</v>

252
00:09:02.671 --> 00:09:03.504
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

253
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:05.270
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't have that framework of,</v>

254
00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:06.133
<v Speaker 2>of um,</v>

255
00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.460
<v Speaker 2>of men having,</v>

256
00:09:07.461 --> 00:09:09.230
<v Speaker 2>and dad's having a value to begin with,</v>

257
00:09:09.231 --> 00:09:10.064
<v Speaker 2>absolutely not.</v>

258
00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:10.851
<v Speaker 2>So here's,</v>

259
00:09:10.851 --> 00:09:15.851
<v Speaker 2>here's maybe what might be helpful for a mom to understand at the rough and</v>

260
00:09:16.501 --> 00:09:16.801
<v Speaker 2>tumble,</v>

261
00:09:16.801 --> 00:09:17.200
<v Speaker 2>pray,</v>

262
00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:17.940
<v Speaker 2>play,</v>

263
00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:18.630
<v Speaker 2>play.</v>

264
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:19.710
<v Speaker 2>We now know,</v>

265
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.620
<v Speaker 2>helps children distinguish between being assertive and aggressive.</v>

266
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.310
<v Speaker 2>But a number of other things off also happened during that play,</v>

267
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:30.750
<v Speaker 2>which is that is a bond that is created between the father and the child.</v>

268
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:35.790
<v Speaker 2>And in almost every and doing expert witness work to help children have both</v>

269
00:09:35.791 --> 00:09:36.121
<v Speaker 2>parents.</v>

270
00:09:36.121 --> 00:09:36.954
<v Speaker 2>You have to divorce.</v>

271
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:39.030
<v Speaker 2>I've observed more than 50 families and,</v>

272
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:44.150
<v Speaker 2>and usually the father interacting with the children and in almost every case,</v>

273
00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:45.050
<v Speaker 2>every case action.</v>

274
00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.660
<v Speaker 2>Actually I believe that I have seen there's this,</v>

275
00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:50.910
<v Speaker 2>this bond is used by the father to say things like,</v>

276
00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:51.750
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

277
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:52.350
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

278
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:53.131
<v Speaker 2>no more rough housing.</v>

279
00:09:53.131 --> 00:09:54.150
<v Speaker 2>Now tell you what,</v>

280
00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:55.830
<v Speaker 2>you get your homework done,</v>

281
00:09:55.831 --> 00:09:57.180
<v Speaker 2>you get your chores done,</v>

282
00:09:57.181 --> 00:09:58.350
<v Speaker 2>you get all ready for bed,</v>

283
00:09:58.351 --> 00:09:58.930
<v Speaker 2>brush your teeth,</v>

284
00:09:58.930 --> 00:09:59.191
<v Speaker 2>teeth,</v>

285
00:09:59.191 --> 00:09:59.401
<v Speaker 2>brush,</v>

286
00:09:59.401 --> 00:10:00.090
<v Speaker 2>whale.</v>

287
00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:00.840
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

288
00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.130
<v Speaker 2>the bedtime is nine o'clock.</v>

289
00:10:02.131 --> 00:10:03.630
<v Speaker 2>Whenever you get all that done,</v>

290
00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:07.860
<v Speaker 2>we'll have between the time you get it done and the time of nine o'clock in</v>

291
00:10:07.861 --> 00:10:11.220
<v Speaker 2>order for you to have some more fun either with rough housing or reading my</v>

292
00:10:11.221 --> 00:10:11.830
<v Speaker 2>favorites,</v>

293
00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:13.320
<v Speaker 2>favorite story or whatever,</v>

294
00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:14.190
<v Speaker 2>whatever you prefer.</v>

295
00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.180
<v Speaker 1>It's your choice.</v>

296
00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:15.291
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

297
00:10:15.291 --> 00:10:17.270
<v Speaker 1>you know with with Panksepp's work too,</v>

298
00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.130
<v Speaker 1>he found that the little routes,</v>

299
00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:23.540
<v Speaker 1>the routes will work to enter a play arena because,</v>

300
00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.440
<v Speaker 1>because play,</v>

301
00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:27.830
<v Speaker 1>you think play is a so Panksepp established very,</v>

302
00:10:27.831 --> 00:10:31.580
<v Speaker 1>very clearly that there is a primary play circuit in mammals.</v>

303
00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:33.680
<v Speaker 1>It's a separate psychobiological circuit.</v>

304
00:10:33.681 --> 00:10:34.880
<v Speaker 1>It's not exploration,</v>

305
00:10:34.881 --> 00:10:36.740
<v Speaker 1>it's a whole different motivational drive,</v>

306
00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:41.480
<v Speaker 1>but that the APP but activity in that circuit is intrinsically pleasurable.</v>

307
00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:46.720
<v Speaker 1>And part of that appears to be because it's so key to proper socialization that</v>

308
00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:47.511
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

309
00:10:47.511 --> 00:10:47.810
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

310
00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:49.310
<v Speaker 1>it's regarded by,</v>

311
00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:52.790
<v Speaker 1>by children and by social mammals as intrinsically valuable.</v>

312
00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:56.450
<v Speaker 1>And so it makes perfect sense that that can be used as a source of primary</v>

313
00:10:56.451 --> 00:10:56.931
<v Speaker 1>reward.</v>

314
00:10:56.931 --> 00:11:01.931
<v Speaker 1>And I think your comments about the the man and the kids binding themselves</v>

315
00:11:02.931 --> 00:11:05.840
<v Speaker 1>together through play is also really important because one of the things that I</v>

316
00:11:05.841 --> 00:11:07.370
<v Speaker 1>do with young men who,</v>

317
00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:07.851
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

318
00:11:07.851 --> 00:11:12.260
<v Speaker 1>I think young men tend to be somewhat alienated from infants who are under about</v>

319
00:11:12.261 --> 00:11:16.610
<v Speaker 1>nine months old because they're not really equipped to know what the hell to do</v>

320
00:11:16.611 --> 00:11:16.910
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>

321
00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:18.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean they can learn and they can be good at it,</v>

322
00:11:18.741 --> 00:11:22.580
<v Speaker 1>but it's not their domain of natural expertise.</v>

323
00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:26.900
<v Speaker 1>But once a kid hits about nine months and starts to be able to imitate and to</v>

324
00:11:26.901 --> 00:11:28.010
<v Speaker 1>pound and to,</v>

325
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.010
<v Speaker 1>and to play and to respond to gentle teasing,</v>

326
00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:34.010
<v Speaker 1>like that's a perfect time for the father to swoop in.</v>

327
00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:35.810
<v Speaker 1>It's very helpful for a mother by the way,</v>

328
00:11:35.811 --> 00:11:40.280
<v Speaker 1>who wants to have another child and to start really cementing a relationship</v>

329
00:11:40.281 --> 00:11:43.520
<v Speaker 1>that's based on that interest in combination of,</v>

330
00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:48.850
<v Speaker 1>of High Energy Fun plus the disciplined interactions that are necessary as a</v>

331
00:11:50.601 --> 00:11:51.530
<v Speaker 1>precursor to that.</v>

332
00:11:51.531 --> 00:11:52.730
<v Speaker 1>And if you interfere with that,</v>

333
00:11:52.731 --> 00:11:57.050
<v Speaker 1>then you stopped the farther from being able to form that pro from liking his</v>

334
00:11:57.051 --> 00:11:57.441
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>

335
00:11:57.441 --> 00:11:58.274
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

336
00:11:58.340 --> 00:11:58.521
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

337
00:11:58.521 --> 00:12:00.550
<v Speaker 1>because that's how the liking comes about is,</v>

338
00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:01.580
<v Speaker 1>is through play.</v>

339
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:02.721
<v Speaker 1>And so it's,</v>

340
00:12:02.721 --> 00:12:03.560
<v Speaker 1>it's crucial.</v>

341
00:12:03.561 --> 00:12:05.090
<v Speaker 1>It's crucial significance.</v>
