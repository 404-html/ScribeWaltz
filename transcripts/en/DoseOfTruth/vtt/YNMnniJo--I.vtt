1
00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:07.140
<v Speaker 1>You bring to bear on the world and a priori perceptual structure,</v>

2
00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.970
<v Speaker 1>and that's really an embodied structure and it's a consequence of the three and</v>

3
00:00:11.971 --> 00:00:15.840
<v Speaker 1>a half billion years that you've spent putting your body together,</v>

4
00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:20.370
<v Speaker 1>which is a tremendous amount of time and not only your body but your mind of</v>

5
00:00:20.371 --> 00:00:20.761
<v Speaker 1>course,</v>

6
00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:24.810
<v Speaker 1>because your mind is part of your body and very much embedded within it.</v>

7
00:00:24.811 --> 00:00:25.340
<v Speaker 1>You know you,</v>

8
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.500
<v Speaker 1>you tend to think that you have your brain in your head and it's sort of</v>

9
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.480
<v Speaker 1>floating separate from the rest of your body,</v>

10
00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:31.830
<v Speaker 1>but it's not really true.</v>

11
00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:36.831
<v Speaker 1>Your tremendous massive system of neurons running through your entire body,</v>

12
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.260
<v Speaker 1>autonomic neurons in the autonomic nervous system.</v>

13
00:00:43.261 --> 00:00:44.820
<v Speaker 1>Then there on the central nervous system.</v>

14
00:00:44.821 --> 00:00:45.900
<v Speaker 1>So that's a lot of neurons.</v>

15
00:00:45.901 --> 00:00:50.640
<v Speaker 1>And then your central nervous system of course enables you to exercise voluntary</v>

16
00:00:50.641 --> 00:00:54.690
<v Speaker 1>control over your musculature and also to receive information from it.</v>

17
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.700
<v Speaker 1>Your brain is really distributed through your body.</v>

18
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.920
<v Speaker 1>One of the things you may not know is that people who are paraplegic can walk.</v>

19
00:01:01.921 --> 00:01:02.370
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

20
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.050
<v Speaker 1>if you suspend them above a treadmill,</v>

21
00:01:04.051 --> 00:01:06.960
<v Speaker 1>their legs will walk by themselves with no voluntary control.</v>

22
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.440
<v Speaker 1>So your spine is capable of quite complex activity.</v>

23
00:01:10.441 --> 00:01:10.831
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

24
00:01:10.831 --> 00:01:11.401
<v Speaker 1>when you walk,</v>

25
00:01:11.401 --> 00:01:15.300
<v Speaker 1>mostly it's a controlled fall and mostly your spine is doing it and so,</v>

26
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.090
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>

27
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.120
<v Speaker 1>the point of all that is that you don't have a blank slate consciousness that's</v>

28
00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:29.451
<v Speaker 1>interpreting a world that manifests itself as segregated objects in some</v>

29
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.991
<v Speaker 1>straight forward.</v>

30
00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:35.880
<v Speaker 1>Since you have a built in interpretive system that's extraordinarily deeply</v>

31
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.440
<v Speaker 1>embedded and invisible because you might think about it as the implicit</v>

32
00:01:40.441 --> 00:01:41.940
<v Speaker 1>structure of your unconscious.</v>

33
00:01:41.941 --> 00:01:46.941
<v Speaker 1>It's what it's what gives rise to your conscious experience and and it presents</v>

34
00:01:46.981 --> 00:01:48.060
<v Speaker 1>you with the world.</v>

35
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.920
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking about it and it's a good way of thinking about it.</v>

36
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.840
<v Speaker 1>It's the psychoanalytic way of thinking about it as well as the neuroscientific</v>

37
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.590
<v Speaker 1>way of thinking about it because one of the things that's pretty interesting</v>

38
00:01:58.591 --> 00:01:59.880
<v Speaker 1>about modern neuroscientist,</v>

39
00:01:59.881 --> 00:02:01.230
<v Speaker 1>especially at the top rate ones,</v>

40
00:02:01.231 --> 00:02:03.960
<v Speaker 1>and those are usually the ones that are working on emotions as far as I've been</v>

41
00:02:03.961 --> 00:02:08.961
<v Speaker 1>able to tell are are often quite enamored of the psychoanalysts.</v>

42
00:02:09.721 --> 00:02:14.610
<v Speaker 1>Jaak Panksepp was a good example of that because they came to understand that</v>

43
00:02:14.611 --> 00:02:19.611
<v Speaker 1>the psychoanalysts insistence on underlying unconscious personified motivations</v>

44
00:02:21.061 --> 00:02:23.670
<v Speaker 1>was actually an accurate reflection of how the brain worked.</v>

45
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.590
<v Speaker 1>And sort of think of yourself as a loose collection of autonomous spirits.</v>

46
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.940
<v Speaker 1>It's governed by some overarching identity is,</v>

47
00:02:31.941 --> 00:02:32.201
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

48
00:02:32.201 --> 00:02:33.930
<v Speaker 1>is a reasonable way of thinking about it.</v>
