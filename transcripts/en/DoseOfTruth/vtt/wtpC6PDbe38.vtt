00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:00.933
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.230
<v Speaker 1>so there was a new article,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was published in nature,</v>

3
00:00:10.231 --> 00:00:13.140
<v Speaker 1>I'll try to find the link for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about a year old that,</v>

4
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.210
<v Speaker 1>that was based on high resolution</v>
<v Speaker 1>imaging of new connections.</v>

5
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.210
<v Speaker 1>It's actually reviewed and Kurt Sal's</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kurzweil's book.</v>

6
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.340
<v Speaker 1>How to build a mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the name of it.</v>

7
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.070
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it turns out that the Cortex is</v>

8
00:00:26.071 --> 00:00:30.900
<v Speaker 1>made out of these columnar structures</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are pre-organized units of neurons</v>

9
00:00:30.901 --> 00:00:33.290
<v Speaker 1>and they're replicated across the entire</v>
<v Speaker 1>cortex.</v>

10
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.100
<v Speaker 1>Basically the same structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like the,</v>

11
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.830
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the older,</v>

12
00:00:37.831 --> 00:00:41.700
<v Speaker 1>let's say connectionist idea was that</v>
<v Speaker 1>neurons that fire together wire</v>

13
00:00:41.701 --> 00:00:42.421
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

14
00:00:42.421 --> 00:00:43.320
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's happened.</v>

15
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.330
<v Speaker 1>Of course that's pretty standard</v>
<v Speaker 1>neurology,</v>

16
00:00:45.331 --> 00:00:48.060
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the columns are already pre wired,</v>

17
00:00:48.061 --> 00:00:50.160
<v Speaker 1>so it's actually columns that fire</v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

18
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:51.360
<v Speaker 1>wire together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's.</v>

19
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.760
<v Speaker 1>But there's even more with the high</v>
<v Speaker 1>resolution scanning.</v>

20
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.420
<v Speaker 1>So it turns out that underneath the</v>
<v Speaker 1>columnar structure,</v>

21
00:00:57.421 --> 00:01:01.020
<v Speaker 1>there are these prebuilt highways that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are connected,</v>

22
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.110
<v Speaker 1>connective tissue that are pre,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pre prepared.</v>

23
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.620
<v Speaker 1>So the columns have the option to</v>
<v Speaker 1>connect to the,</v>

24
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.560
<v Speaker 1>to the underlying highway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that highway can connect other</v>

25
00:01:10.561 --> 00:01:14.070
<v Speaker 1>columns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's as if implicit in the brain</v>

26
00:01:14.071 --> 00:01:16.050
<v Speaker 1>organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is at the cortical level,</v>

27
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.080
<v Speaker 1>say nothing of subcortical organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's already preexistent uh,</v>

28
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>likelihoods that certain neurons will</v>

29
00:01:24.031 --> 00:01:25.890
<v Speaker 1>fire wire together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

30
00:01:25.891 --> 00:01:26.441
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

31
00:01:26.441 --> 00:01:31.441
<v Speaker 1>and what else is cool is that this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually architecturally quite a</v>

32
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.950
<v Speaker 1>regular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they found that the,</v>

33
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.610
<v Speaker 1>these superhighways arranged in lines</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

34
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:37.563
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

35
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.380
<v Speaker 1>and in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at right angles to one another.</v>

36
00:01:40.381 --> 00:01:44.100
<v Speaker 1>So it's almost like a three dimensional</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of why your cubes that</v>

37
00:01:44.101 --> 00:01:47.550
<v Speaker 1>underlies the neuronal structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's some neurological evidence for</v>

38
00:01:47.551 --> 00:01:48.570
<v Speaker 1>the archetypal idea.</v>
