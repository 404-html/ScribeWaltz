00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.140
<v Speaker 1>You speak frequently in your lectures about,</v>

2
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.000
<v Speaker 1>I guess the war between good and evil or the struggle of life really is a</v>

3
00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:19.650
<v Speaker 1>struggle between good and evil being at the core of a conscious lived existence.</v>

4
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.920
<v Speaker 1>And I guess on that note,</v>

5
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.680
<v Speaker 1>if you were 100% certain that there was no afterlife,</v>

6
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.190
<v Speaker 1>would you still be able to preach that there's a positive meeting in life?</v>

7
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.440
<v Speaker 1>If you're 100% certain,</v>

8
00:00:37.441 --> 00:00:42.030
<v Speaker 1>some atheists seem to be 100% certain and yet they still preach that there's</v>

9
00:00:42.031 --> 00:00:43.620
<v Speaker 1>some positive meaning to life,</v>

10
00:00:43.621 --> 00:00:46.370
<v Speaker 1>would you be one of those or would you turn into cane?</v>

11
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:47.040
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

12
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.880
<v Speaker 1>so cynical.</v>

13
00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.293
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

14
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.530
<v Speaker 1>well for as far as I'm concerned,</v>

15
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.660
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I learned from studying 20th century history is that like even</v>

16
00:00:56.661 --> 00:01:00.230
<v Speaker 1>if the idea that even if you take the most cynical of ideas,</v>

17
00:01:00.231 --> 00:01:05.231
<v Speaker 1>let's say that life is irredeemable suffering and perhaps isn't even justified</v>

18
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.553
<v Speaker 1>because of that,</v>

19
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.380
<v Speaker 1>it still seems to me that you have an ethical duty,</v>

20
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.440
<v Speaker 1>let's say to live in a manner that reduces that to the degree that that's</v>

21
00:01:17.691 --> 00:01:18.524
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

22
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.030
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

23
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.600
<v Speaker 1>and I think that that can be experienced as meaningful in some sense</v>

24
00:01:23.601 --> 00:01:26.060
<v Speaker 1>independently of the transcendent context.</v>

25
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.890
<v Speaker 1>Now I don't exactly know how to strip off the transcendent context because one</v>

26
00:01:30.891 --> 00:01:34.070
<v Speaker 1>of the things I would say that's happened to me is because I've spent so much</v>

27
00:01:34.071 --> 00:01:37.880
<v Speaker 1>time looking at the horrible things that people have done is that it's like</v>

28
00:01:37.881 --> 00:01:39.850
<v Speaker 1>young said that he wanted,</v>

29
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.090
<v Speaker 1>this is one of his famous quotes.</v>

30
00:01:41.091 --> 00:01:41.810
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

31
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.860
<v Speaker 1>no tree can reach up to heaven unless its roots reached down to hell.</v>

32
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.630
<v Speaker 1>And so as I've dug deeper into the depravity of human beings,</v>

33
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.520
<v Speaker 1>my sense of the possibility of human beings has also grown.</v>

34
00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.080
<v Speaker 1>What would you say in proportion and until I've become convinced actually that</v>

35
00:02:02.691 --> 00:02:04.640
<v Speaker 1>good is a more powerful force than evil,</v>

36
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.700
<v Speaker 1>even though evil is an unbelievably powerful force.</v>

37
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.360
<v Speaker 1>And so I can't really strip the transcended away.</v>

38
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:14.150
<v Speaker 1>Now whether what bearing that has on eternity say on an afterlife?</v>

39
00:02:14.151 --> 00:02:14.984
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

40
00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.993
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

41
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.900
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

42
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.500
<v Speaker 1>I can't say anything about that.</v>

43
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.970
<v Speaker 1>The only thing I guess I can say is that there are many things about being that</v>

44
00:02:22.971 --> 00:02:24.500
<v Speaker 1>we don't understand in the least.</v>

45
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.000
<v Speaker 1>And we don't understand the nature of consciousness or the nature of time.</v>

46
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:30.810
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

47
00:02:30.811 --> 00:02:31.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

48
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.080
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't despair about that,</v>

49
00:02:33.081 --> 00:02:33.471
<v Speaker 1>but yes,</v>

50
00:02:33.471 --> 00:02:35.840
<v Speaker 1>I think that life can still be meaningful without,</v>

51
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.830
<v Speaker 1>without there being a necessity of an afterlife.</v>

52
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.400
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
