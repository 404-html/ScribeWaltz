1
00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.741
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>

2
00:00:06.741 --> 00:00:07.491
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Peterson.</v>

3
00:00:07.491 --> 00:00:08.900
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much.</v>

4
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.210
<v Speaker 1>And my question is regarding Adhd,</v>

5
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.180
<v Speaker 1>which is something I haven't heard you speak a whole lot about,</v>

6
00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:15.014
<v Speaker 1>maybe a little bit.</v>

7
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.233
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

8
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.060
<v Speaker 1>now it seems to me that we are at least maybe just me,</v>

9
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.090
<v Speaker 1>do not quite understand ADHD to what could be its full capacity maybe.</v>

10
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.360
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

11
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.110
<v Speaker 1>cause there's many,</v>

12
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:32.110
<v Speaker 1>many voices saying that it's an overdiagnosed overblown small mental variance</v>

13
00:00:32.751 --> 00:00:36.260
<v Speaker 1>that's prevalent in boys or it's just young boys being young boys.</v>

14
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.530
<v Speaker 1>And then there are some that would fight and advocate for a very different</v>

15
00:00:41.901 --> 00:00:43.640
<v Speaker 1>treatment in the academic world.</v>

16
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.893
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

17
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.280
<v Speaker 1>and I was wondering what you,</v>

18
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.400
<v Speaker 1>what your thoughts are on Adhd itself.</v>

19
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:50.383
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

20
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:51.493
<v Speaker 1>and on,</v>

21
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:52.363
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

22
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.060
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

23
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.860
<v Speaker 1>whether you think it's overdiagnosed and maybe advice for me as someone who has</v>

24
00:00:57.861 --> 00:01:02.861
<v Speaker 1>been diagnosed with ADHD on how to overcome it without maybe becoming completely</v>

25
00:01:03.351 --> 00:01:05.930
<v Speaker 1>reliant on prescribed medication.</v>

26
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.791
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

27
00:01:07.791 --> 00:01:09.590
<v Speaker 2>So first of all,</v>

28
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.540
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely overdiagnosed.</v>

29
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.213
<v Speaker 2>Second,</v>

30
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:15.410
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

31
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.080
<v Speaker 2>it's very unreliable.</v>

32
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.700
<v Speaker 2>Psychiatric diagnosis.</v>

33
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.900
<v Speaker 2>Many psychiatric diagnosis are unreliable and that's because psychiatric</v>

34
00:01:23.901 --> 00:01:26.750
<v Speaker 2>diagnosis aren't precisely scientific categories.</v>

35
00:01:26.751 --> 00:01:27.800
<v Speaker 2>They're weird hybrids,</v>

36
00:01:27.801 --> 00:01:28.041
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

37
00:01:28.041 --> 00:01:28.790
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

38
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.290
<v Speaker 2>psychiatrists aren't scientists.</v>

39
00:01:30.291 --> 00:01:31.220
<v Speaker 2>They're engineers.</v>

40
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.090
<v Speaker 2>Engineers are trying to do something rather than to describe the objective world</v>

41
00:01:35.091 --> 00:01:37.460
<v Speaker 2>and psychiatrists are trying to make people healthy,</v>

42
00:01:37.461 --> 00:01:38.480
<v Speaker 2>whatever that means.</v>

43
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.190
<v Speaker 2>It's actually partly ethical.</v>

44
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.600
<v Speaker 2>It's very complicated.</v>

45
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.480
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

46
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.900
<v Speaker 2>We don't know how to distinguish it from temperamental variation.</v>

47
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.131
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

48
00:01:51.131 --> 00:01:53.950
<v Speaker 2>if you're high in openness and high in extroversion and low in</v>

49
00:01:53.951 --> 00:01:55.150
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness,</v>

50
00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:57.050
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

51
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.010
<v Speaker 2>low in agreeableness,</v>

52
00:01:58.011 --> 00:02:01.340
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness and and high in neuroticism,</v>

53
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.520
<v Speaker 2>you're likely to manifest symptoms of Adhd.</v>

54
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.860
<v Speaker 2>It's because your exploratory,</v>

55
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.300
<v Speaker 2>you don't like to sit down,</v>

56
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.410
<v Speaker 2>you're full of ideas,</v>

57
00:02:09.411 --> 00:02:13.490
<v Speaker 2>your attention scatters across a wide variety of topics and you're not very</v>

58
00:02:13.491 --> 00:02:14.324
<v Speaker 2>stable,</v>

59
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.530
<v Speaker 2>temperamental variation.</v>

60
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.690
<v Speaker 2>It's also much more common among boys.</v>

61
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.933
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

62
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.450
<v Speaker 2>Panksepp showed same guy with rats that if you deprive young routes of rough and</v>

63
00:02:26.631 --> 00:02:27.620
<v Speaker 2>tumble play,</v>

64
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.800
<v Speaker 2>which is what the young boys are deprived of in school,</v>

65
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.420
<v Speaker 2>let's say that,</v>

66
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

67
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.870
<v Speaker 2>they get hyperactive and then their prefrontal cortex is don't develop very well</v>

68
00:02:38.661 --> 00:02:41.480
<v Speaker 2>because they're not having the right kinds of experiences and that you can treat</v>

69
00:02:41.481 --> 00:02:45.440
<v Speaker 2>that quite effectively with psychomotor stimulants like Ritalin.</v>

70
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.420
<v Speaker 2>So that's kind of an interesting bit of scientific information that no one pays</v>

71
00:02:50.421 --> 00:02:51.260
<v Speaker 2>any attention to.</v>

72
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.760
<v Speaker 2>There was also absolutely no evidence whatsoever that longterm use of</v>

73
00:02:55.761 --> 00:03:00.761
<v Speaker 2>psychomotor stimulants produces increases in cognitive gate zero and there's</v>

74
00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:02.440
<v Speaker 2>plenty of evidence that it's harmful.</v>

75
00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:04.123
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

76
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.150
<v Speaker 2>then the second part of that was what about,</v>

77
00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.133
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

78
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.520
<v Speaker 2>adjustments for in the academic world say that would be disability adjustments.</v>

79
00:03:18.011 --> 00:03:22.090
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's a such a rat's nest that I don't want to even discuss it.</v>

80
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean it it,</v>

81
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.050
<v Speaker 2>I'll discuss it for like 15 seconds.</v>

82
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.630
<v Speaker 2>There is a never ending multiplication of disabilities.</v>

83
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.190
<v Speaker 2>That's what's happening right now.</v>

84
00:03:33.191 --> 00:03:36.850
<v Speaker 2>The disability offices in the universities are swamped.</v>

85
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.090
<v Speaker 2>Like I know some people have it rough like,</v>

86
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.751
<v Speaker 2>believe me,</v>

87
00:03:40.751 --> 00:03:41.890
<v Speaker 2>I know that I was,</v>

88
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:42.763
<v Speaker 2>I prob,</v>

89
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.350
<v Speaker 2>I seriously know that I've dealt with extraordinarily damaged people in my life.</v>

90
00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.930
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] you're bloody hard pressed to find someone who doesn't have a</v>

91
00:03:53.931 --> 00:03:58.931
<v Speaker 2>serious problem or who doesn't have a serious problem in a close family member.</v>

92
00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.730
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

93
00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.310
<v Speaker 2>where do you draw the line with regards to disability?</v>

94
00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:04.851
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

95
00:04:04.851 --> 00:04:05.684
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>

96
00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.860
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>

97
00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.000
<v Speaker 2>They multiply just like LGBT identities multiply.</v>

98
00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.210
<v Speaker 2>Just know g really technically just like that.</v>

99
00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.140
<v Speaker 2>Just like intersectionality categories of oppression multiply.</v>

100
00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.831
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

101
00:04:18.831 --> 00:04:19.240
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

102
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.460
<v Speaker 2>it's inevitable the way that you deal with it.</v>

103
00:04:22.461 --> 00:04:24.200
<v Speaker 2>As you have objective standards,</v>

104
00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.430
<v Speaker 2>you apply them to everyone.</v>

105
00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.410
<v Speaker 2>Not because that's fair.</v>

106
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:28.461
<v Speaker 2>It's not fair.</v>

107
00:04:28.461 --> 00:04:29.294
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>

108
00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.930
<v Speaker 2>if your criteria for fairness is that everyone has the same outcome,</v>

109
00:04:32.931 --> 00:04:33.920
<v Speaker 2>it's not fair at all.</v>

110
00:04:33.921 --> 00:04:35.450
<v Speaker 2>It's not even close to fair.</v>

111
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.750
<v Speaker 2>It's just less tie radical then the alternatives.</v>

112
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.010
<v Speaker 2>Now we don't know that yet because we haven't seen the full range of the tyranny</v>

113
00:04:43.011 --> 00:04:45.140
<v Speaker 2>of the alternatives manifest itself.</v>

114
00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.220
<v Speaker 2>Not In our culture,</v>

115
00:04:46.221 --> 00:04:48.080
<v Speaker 2>but it certainly did in other cultures.</v>

116
00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.150
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a bad idea now.</v>

117
00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be absolute about that.</v>

118
00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.953
<v Speaker 2>Like</v>

119
00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.271
<v Speaker 2>it's tricky,</v>

120
00:04:58.271 --> 00:04:58.601
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

121
00:04:58.601 --> 00:05:01.300
<v Speaker 2>because if you have a disability</v>

122
00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.823
<v Speaker 3>that</v>

123
00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:08.740
<v Speaker 2>would allow you to do the work in the university and in the workplace with a</v>

124
00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:10.030
<v Speaker 2>modification,</v>

125
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.120
<v Speaker 2>then perhaps the modification could be made.</v>

126
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.240
<v Speaker 2>But I think that was done a lot better when I was in the hands of the professors</v>

127
00:05:16.241 --> 00:05:21.100
<v Speaker 2>and not in the hands of these crazy bureaucratic structures that have risen up</v>

128
00:05:21.101 --> 00:05:22.420
<v Speaker 2>around the disability issue.</v>

129
00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.350
<v Speaker 2>Like they're one of the 10 things that are going to kill the universities or</v>

130
00:05:26.351 --> 00:05:27.430
<v Speaker 2>maybe have already killed them,</v>

131
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.630
<v Speaker 2>possibly because they may,</v>

132
00:05:29.631 --> 00:05:33.010
<v Speaker 2>they're walking corpses as far as I can tell zombies,</v>

133
00:05:33.011 --> 00:05:33.460
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

134
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:34.390
<v Speaker 2>and that might be wrong,</v>

135
00:05:34.391 --> 00:05:36.100
<v Speaker 2>but is what it looks like to me.</v>
