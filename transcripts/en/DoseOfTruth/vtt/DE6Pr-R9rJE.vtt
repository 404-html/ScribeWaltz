00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.550
<v Speaker 1>Dark prior to says how can you dispute the theory that Jesus is just a rewrite</v>

2
00:00:11.551 --> 00:00:12.840
<v Speaker 1>of the Sun God myth?</v>

3
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:14.431
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4
00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:16.590
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't necessarily dispute that theory.</v>

5
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.730
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

6
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.830
<v Speaker 1>although I would dispute the just,</v>

7
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean the strange things about the biblical stories and let's say about the new</v>

8
00:00:24.481 --> 00:00:28.500
<v Speaker 1>testament stories is that they echo across multiple levels of analysis.</v>

9
00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:33.501
<v Speaker 1>And so there is an astrological element to the Christ story.</v>

10
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

11
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.680
<v Speaker 1>that Yo wrote about a fair bit in the book called Ion,</v>

12
00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:39.120
<v Speaker 1>which is a very terrifying book.</v>

13
00:00:39.121 --> 00:00:41.940
<v Speaker 1>And there are examples of the myths of the Sun God.</v>

14
00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:42.690
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

15
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.580
<v Speaker 1>but the funny thing is,</v>

16
00:00:44.581 --> 00:00:47.640
<v Speaker 1>and this is one of the things I can't really understand about the biblical</v>

17
00:00:47.641 --> 00:00:48.031
<v Speaker 1>stories,</v>

18
00:00:48.031 --> 00:00:52.830
<v Speaker 1>is that they manifest themselves at multiple levels of interpretation</v>

19
00:00:52.831 --> 00:00:53.850
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously.</v>

20
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.570
<v Speaker 1>And you could say that that's merely a consequence of continual historical</v>

21
00:00:57.571 --> 00:00:58.231
<v Speaker 1>reworking.</v>

22
00:00:58.231 --> 00:01:00.540
<v Speaker 1>And I suppose that could be the case,</v>

23
00:01:00.541 --> 00:01:05.541
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that they manifest themselves as a personal story and as a cosmic</v>

24
00:01:05.851 --> 00:01:10.410
<v Speaker 1>story and as a historical story and as a mythological story and that it all</v>

25
00:01:10.411 --> 00:01:12.630
<v Speaker 1>works at the same time strikes me as,</v>

26
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.710
<v Speaker 1>as pointing to something that's really somewhat beyond our current level of</v>

27
00:01:16.711 --> 00:01:17.544
<v Speaker 1>understanding.</v>

28
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.853
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

29
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.851
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

30
00:01:19.851 --> 00:01:23.100
<v Speaker 1>to elaborate on that a lot because it would take us into places that I really</v>

31
00:01:23.101 --> 00:01:24.120
<v Speaker 1>would rather not go,</v>

32
00:01:24.121 --> 00:01:29.121
<v Speaker 1>but I do believe that like there's something synchronous using Young's</v>

33
00:01:29.971 --> 00:01:31.330
<v Speaker 1>terminology about the,</v>

34
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.080
<v Speaker 1>about death and resurrection story.</v>

35
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.420
<v Speaker 1>And the syncronous element is,</v>

36
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.800
<v Speaker 1>is associated with the fact that the story echoes across so many levels of</v>

37
00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:41.634
<v Speaker 1>analysis.</v>

38
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.030
<v Speaker 1>And my sense is that when something echoes across many levels of analysis,</v>

39
00:01:47.281 --> 00:01:51.150
<v Speaker 1>that means that it's approaching something like a very deep truth.</v>

40
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.380
<v Speaker 1>So I know that isn't normally how we go about determining what constitutes</v>

41
00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:55.801
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>

42
00:01:55.801 --> 00:02:00.300
<v Speaker 1>but we don't know everything about how to determine what constitutes truth yet.</v>

43
00:02:00.301 --> 00:02:04.060
<v Speaker 1>And there are many things that we have yet to figure out,</v>

44
00:02:04.061 --> 00:02:04.601
<v Speaker 1>can that,</v>

45
00:02:04.601 --> 00:02:05.371
<v Speaker 1>certainly one of them,</v>

46
00:02:05.371 --> 00:02:06.390
<v Speaker 1>as far as I'm concerned.</v>

47
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.660
<v Speaker 1>So there is a Sun God myth element,</v>

48
00:02:09.661 --> 00:02:12.570
<v Speaker 1>certainly parallels between Christ and Horace,</v>

49
00:02:12.571 --> 00:02:13.404
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

50
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.071
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

51
00:02:14.071 --> 00:02:14.904
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

52
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.540
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean you can just say it's just a rewrite.</v>

53
00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:19.410
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

54
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that the,</v>

55
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that that's historically or a psychologically accurate.</v>

56
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.810
<v Speaker 1>Um.</v>
