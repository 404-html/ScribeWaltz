1
00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:07.210
<v Speaker 1>How about</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we should first decide what we're</v>

2
00:00:07.771 --> 00:00:11.550
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not talking about my views of</v>

3
00:00:11.551 --> 00:00:15.690
<v Speaker 1>political correctness despite what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>might have inferred from the last</v>

4
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.770
<v Speaker 1>speaker's comments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how it looks to me.</v>

5
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.250
<v Speaker 1>We essentially need something</v>
<v Speaker 1>approximating a low resolution grant</v>

6
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.290
<v Speaker 1>narrative to unitus and we did narrative</v>
<v Speaker 1>to united because otherwise we don't</v>

7
00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:35.040
<v Speaker 1>have peace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's playing out in the universities</v>

8
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.970
<v Speaker 1>and in broader society right now is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>debate between two fundamental low</v>

9
00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:41.820
<v Speaker 1>resolution narratives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neither of which can be completely</v>

10
00:00:41.821 --> 00:00:44.130
<v Speaker 1>accurate because they can't encompass</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the details.</v>

11
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.560
<v Speaker 1>Obviously human beings have an</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual element and a collective</v>

12
00:00:47.561 --> 00:00:49.050
<v Speaker 1>element.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A group element.</v>

13
00:00:49.051 --> 00:00:52.740
<v Speaker 1>Let's say the question is what story</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be paramount,</v>

14
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.310
<v Speaker 1>and this is how it looks to me in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>West.</v>

15
00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.050
<v Speaker 1>We have reasonably functional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonably free,</v>

16
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.350
<v Speaker 1>remarkably productive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stable hierarchies that are open to</v>

17
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.600
<v Speaker 1>consideration of the dispossessed that</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies generally create.</v>

18
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.690
<v Speaker 1>Our societies are freer and functioning</v>
<v Speaker 1>more effectively than any societies or</v>

19
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.230
<v Speaker 1>anywhere else in the world and that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then any societies ever have and as far</v>

20
00:01:22.231 --> 00:01:24.480
<v Speaker 1>as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think there's good reason to</v>

21
00:01:24.481 --> 00:01:26.740
<v Speaker 1>assume this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because the fundamental low</v>

22
00:01:26.741 --> 00:01:30.570
<v Speaker 1>resolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a grant narrative that we've oriented</v>

23
00:01:30.571 --> 00:01:33.690
<v Speaker 1>ourselves around in the West is one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sovereignty of the individual and</v>

24
00:01:33.691 --> 00:01:38.430
<v Speaker 1>it's predicated on the idea that all</v>
<v Speaker 1>things considered the best way for me to</v>

25
00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:42.390
<v Speaker 1>interact with someone else's individual</v>
<v Speaker 1>to individual and to react to that</v>

26
00:01:42.391 --> 00:01:47.391
<v Speaker 1>person as if they're both part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>process because that's the right way of</v>

27
00:01:47.851 --> 00:01:50.580
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The psychological process by which</v>

28
00:01:50.581 --> 00:01:53.520
<v Speaker 1>things we don't understand can yet be</v>
<v Speaker 1>explored and buy.</v>

29
00:01:53.521 --> 00:01:57.420
<v Speaker 1>Things that aren't properly organized in</v>
<v Speaker 1>our society can be yet set right.</v>

30
00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.940
<v Speaker 1>The reason we're valuable as</v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals,</v>

31
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.520
<v Speaker 1>both with regards to our rights and</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities,</v>

32
00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:04.560
<v Speaker 1>is because that's our essential purpose.</v>

33
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.260
<v Speaker 1>Announce our nobility and that's our</v>
<v Speaker 1>function.</v>

34
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.880
<v Speaker 1>What's happening as far as I'm concerned</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the universities in particular and</v>

35
00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:14.040
<v Speaker 1>spreading very rapidly out into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>broader world,</v>

36
00:02:14.041 --> 00:02:16.050
<v Speaker 1>including the corporate world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much to.</v>

37
00:02:16.051 --> 00:02:21.051
<v Speaker 1>It's a much to what should be its</v>
<v Speaker 1>chagrin is a collectivist narrative and</v>

38
00:02:22.171 --> 00:02:26.030
<v Speaker 1>of course there's some utility in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>collectivist narrative because we're all</v>

39
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.120
<v Speaker 1>part of groups in different ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the collectivist narrative that I</v>

40
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.770
<v Speaker 1>regard as politically correct as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pastiche of a strange pastiche of</v>

41
00:02:34.771 --> 00:02:38.880
<v Speaker 1>postmodernism and neo Marxism in its</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental claim is that no,</v>

42
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.010
<v Speaker 1>you're not essentially an individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're essentially a member of a group</v>

43
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.180
<v Speaker 1>and that group might be your ethnicity</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it might be your sex and it might be</v>

44
00:02:48.181 --> 00:02:52.140
<v Speaker 1>a race and it might be any of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>endless numbers of other potential</v>

45
00:02:52.141 --> 00:02:56.130
<v Speaker 1>groups that you belong to because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>belong to many of them and that you</v>

46
00:02:56.131 --> 00:02:59.560
<v Speaker 1>should be essentially categorized along</v>
<v Speaker 1>with those who are like on that</v>

47
00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:00.790
<v Speaker 1>dimension in that group.</v>

48
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.090
<v Speaker 1>That's proposition number one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Proposition number two is that the</v>

49
00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:09.091
<v Speaker 1>proper way to view the world is as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>battleground between groups of different</v>

50
00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:11.410
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you define the groups first and then</v>

51
00:03:11.411 --> 00:03:13.080
<v Speaker 1>you assume that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

52
00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.090
<v Speaker 1>you viewed the individual from the group</v>
<v Speaker 1>context.</v>

53
00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:19.690
<v Speaker 1>You viewed the battle between groups</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the group context and you view</v>

54
00:03:19.691 --> 00:03:24.100
<v Speaker 1>history itself as a consequence of</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing but the power maneuvers between</v>

55
00:03:24.101 --> 00:03:28.360
<v Speaker 1>different groups that eliminates any</v>
<v Speaker 1>consideration of the individual and at a</v>

56
00:03:28.361 --> 00:03:32.230
<v Speaker 1>very fundamental level and also any</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea,</v>

57
00:03:32.231 --> 00:03:34.900
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of free speech because if you're</v>

58
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.920
<v Speaker 1>collectivist at heart in this manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no such thing as free speech.</v>

59
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.930
<v Speaker 1>It isn't that it's debated by those on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the radical left and let's say the rest</v>

60
00:03:43.931 --> 00:03:46.810
<v Speaker 1>of us so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that in that formulation there's no</v>

61
00:03:46.811 --> 00:03:50.380
<v Speaker 1>such thing as free speech because for an</v>
<v Speaker 1>individualist free speech is how you</v>

62
00:03:50.381 --> 00:03:53.350
<v Speaker 1>make sense of the world and reorganize</v>
<v Speaker 1>society in a proper manner,</v>

63
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.670
<v Speaker 1>but for the radical left type</v>
<v Speaker 1>collectivist that's associated with this</v>

64
00:03:57.671 --> 00:04:00.040
<v Speaker 1>viewpoint of political correctness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you speak,</v>

65
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.350
<v Speaker 1>all you're doing is playing a power game</v>
<v Speaker 1>on behalf of your group and there's</v>

66
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.960
<v Speaker 1>nothing else that you can do because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all there is and not only is that</v>

67
00:04:07.961 --> 00:04:11.710
<v Speaker 1>all there is in terms of who you are as</v>
<v Speaker 1>an individual now and how society should</v>

68
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:12.310
<v Speaker 1>be viewed.</v>

69
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.560
<v Speaker 1>It's also the fundamental narrative of</v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

70
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.060
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's widely assumed in our universities</v>

71
00:04:19.061 --> 00:04:23.710
<v Speaker 1>now that the best way to conceptualize</v>
<v Speaker 1>Western civilization is as an oppressive</v>

72
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.610
<v Speaker 1>male dominated patriarchy and that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best way to construe relationships</v>

73
00:04:27.611 --> 00:04:31.480
<v Speaker 1>between men and women across the</v>
<v Speaker 1>centuries is one of oppression of women</v>

74
00:04:31.481 --> 00:04:33.760
<v Speaker 1>by men as like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

75
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.800
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no hierarchy is without it's tyranny.</v>

76
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.290
<v Speaker 1>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an axiomatic truth.</v>

77
00:04:41.291 --> 00:04:45.250
<v Speaker 1>People have recognized that literally</v>
<v Speaker 1>for thousands of years and hierarchies</v>

78
00:04:45.251 --> 00:04:49.960
<v Speaker 1>do tend towards tyranny and they tend</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards the use of patient by people</v>

79
00:04:49.961 --> 00:04:52.240
<v Speaker 1>with power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that only happens when they become</v>

80
00:04:52.241 --> 00:04:57.130
<v Speaker 1>corrupt and we have mechanisms in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>society to stop hierarchies from</v>

81
00:04:57.131 --> 00:04:58.300
<v Speaker 1>becoming intolerable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be corrupt,</v>

82
00:04:58.301 --> 00:05:01.600
<v Speaker 1>and they actually work pretty well and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so and so.</v>

83
00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.370
<v Speaker 1>I would also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would also.</v>

84
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.560
<v Speaker 1>I would also point this out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

85
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.850
<v Speaker 1>don't be thinking that this is a debate</v>
<v Speaker 1>about whether empathy is useful or not</v>

86
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.330
<v Speaker 1>or that the people on the con side of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the argument are not empathetic.</v>

87
00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.240
<v Speaker 1>I know perfectly well as sure Mr Frye</v>
<v Speaker 1>does that.</v>

88
00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.280
<v Speaker 1>Hierarchies tend to produce situations</v>
<v Speaker 1>where people stack up at the bottom and</v>

89
00:05:21.281 --> 00:05:23.680
<v Speaker 1>that the dispossessed and hierarchies</v>
<v Speaker 1>need a political voice,</v>

90
00:05:23.681 --> 00:05:25.540
<v Speaker 1>which is the proper voice of the left by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way,</v>

91
00:05:25.541 --> 00:05:29.830
<v Speaker 1>and the necessary voice of the left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that is not the same as proclaiming</v>

92
00:05:29.831 --> 00:05:34.270
<v Speaker 1>that the right level of analysis for our</v>
<v Speaker 1>grand unifying narrative is that all of</v>

93
00:05:34.271 --> 00:05:39.160
<v Speaker 1>us are fundamentally to be identified by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the groups that we belong to and to</v>

94
00:05:39.161 --> 00:05:43.690
<v Speaker 1>construe the entire world as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>battleground between different forms of</v>

95
00:05:43.691 --> 00:05:48.100
<v Speaker 1>tyranny in consequence of that group</v>
<v Speaker 1>affiliation and to the degree that we</v>

96
00:05:48.101 --> 00:05:51.310
<v Speaker 1>play out that narrative that won't be</v>
<v Speaker 1>progress.</v>

97
00:05:51.311 --> 00:05:53.470
<v Speaker 1>Believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we certainly haven't seen that</v>

98
00:05:53.471 --> 00:05:57.350
<v Speaker 1>progress in the universities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've seen situations like what at</v>

99
00:05:57.351 --> 00:06:00.590
<v Speaker 1>Wilfrid laurier university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead we won't see progress.</v>

100
00:06:00.591 --> 00:06:04.790
<v Speaker 1>What will return to is exactly the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of tribalism to characterize the</v>

101
00:06:04.791 --> 00:06:05.624
<v Speaker 1>lamp.</v>

102
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:14.630
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
