00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:00.973
<v Speaker 1>Hmm,</v>

2
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.120
<v Speaker 1>here's another thing that made me a</v>
<v Speaker 1>really an advocate of psychoanalytic</v>

3
00:00:11.121 --> 00:00:13.940
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the sort of thing that started to</v>

4
00:00:13.941 --> 00:00:16.880
<v Speaker 1>terrify me about what the human psyche</v>
<v Speaker 1>was actually like.</v>

5
00:00:16.881 --> 00:00:20.820
<v Speaker 1>I started to understand that not only</v>
<v Speaker 1>were we like an amalgam of,</v>

6
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.900
<v Speaker 1>of relatively autonomous</v>
<v Speaker 1>subpersonalities,</v>

7
00:00:23.901 --> 00:00:27.050
<v Speaker 1>each of which had the possibility of</v>
<v Speaker 1>gaining control,</v>

8
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.120
<v Speaker 1>but that we're also victim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

9
00:00:32.121 --> 00:00:37.121
<v Speaker 1>or beneficiary of impulses that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond our conscious formulation or,</v>

10
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.630
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or understanding or capacity to resist.</v>

11
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.060
<v Speaker 1>So here's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a funny story.</v>

12
00:00:44.061 --> 00:00:49.061
<v Speaker 1>So I was talking to one of my patron</v>
<v Speaker 1>people online this week and he said he's</v>

13
00:00:49.731 --> 00:00:51.770
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a committed atheist and that's</v>

14
00:00:51.771 --> 00:00:52.430
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.610
<v Speaker 1>lots of atheists are very honest people</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're atheists because they don't</v>

16
00:00:55.611 --> 00:01:00.611
<v Speaker 1>know how to reconcile what they know</v>
<v Speaker 1>with traditional claims,</v>

17
00:01:01.041 --> 00:01:03.440
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're not willing to just mangled</v>

18
00:01:03.441 --> 00:01:04.490
<v Speaker 1>them together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

19
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.370
<v Speaker 1>and there might be cynicism all that</v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with it as well.</v>

20
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.640
<v Speaker 1>But he said he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said he was entranced by these</v>

21
00:01:10.641 --> 00:01:11.860
<v Speaker 1>biblical lectures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.760
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

23
00:01:13.761 --> 00:01:17.330
<v Speaker 1>if someone would have told them a year</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago that he was going to be obsessed</v>

24
00:01:17.331 --> 00:01:20.000
<v Speaker 1>with the sequence of Biblical lectures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would have told them that they were</v>

25
00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:22.940
<v Speaker 1>mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we had a bit of a discussion</v>

26
00:01:22.941 --> 00:01:24.890
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because this is an interesting</v>

27
00:01:24.891 --> 00:01:25.724
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

28
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.290
<v Speaker 1>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he mentioned this,</v>

29
00:01:27.291 --> 00:01:30.740
<v Speaker 1>he said it was something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't choose your interests.</v>

30
00:01:30.741 --> 00:01:33.950
<v Speaker 1>They choose you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really worth thinking about</v>

31
00:01:33.951 --> 00:01:34.431
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

32
00:01:34.431 --> 00:01:37.730
<v Speaker 1>because you know it's really hard to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in something you're not</v>

33
00:01:37.731 --> 00:01:39.680
<v Speaker 1>interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you know there's a good reason</v>

34
00:01:39.681 --> 00:01:41.630
<v Speaker 1>for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you're studying for an exam,</v>

35
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.770
<v Speaker 1>you find the material boring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know anything will be more</v>

36
00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:47.540
<v Speaker 1>interesting than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than this studying.</v>

37
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.670
<v Speaker 1>Even though you know that that's what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to do.</v>

38
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.420
<v Speaker 1>You can't voluntarily grab yourself by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scruff of the neck,</v>

39
00:01:53.421 --> 00:01:55.220
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and shake yourself and say,</v>

40
00:01:55.221 --> 00:01:58.280
<v Speaker 1>sit down and concentrate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your mind will just go everywhere.</v>

41
00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.200
<v Speaker 1>But then if you're interested in</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

42
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.900
<v Speaker 1>and even if it's something you shouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>be interested in,</v>

43
00:02:02.901 --> 00:02:06.160
<v Speaker 1>because that happens all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's like you're a laser focused</v>

44
00:02:06.161 --> 00:02:08.000
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can pay attention forever,</v>

45
00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:10.430
<v Speaker 1>you can work until you're exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You won't even notice it.</v>

46
00:02:10.431 --> 00:02:12.230
<v Speaker 1>Then you remember everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

47
00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:15.440
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can't control your interest,</v>

48
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.950
<v Speaker 1>what does?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Man,</v>

49
00:02:18.951 --> 00:02:20.780
<v Speaker 1>I tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think about that for a very long</v>

50
00:02:20.781 --> 00:02:23.060
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you talked about the spirit</v>

51
00:02:23.061 --> 00:02:24.590
<v Speaker 1>Mercurius,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

52
00:02:24.591 --> 00:02:27.010
<v Speaker 1>mercury is the winged messenger of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gods and,</v>

53
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.480
<v Speaker 1>and here's how he conceptualized it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Psychologically,</v>

54
00:02:29.481 --> 00:02:34.370
<v Speaker 1>he thought this is what the ancient</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who thought about mercury as the</v>

55
00:02:34.371 --> 00:02:36.950
<v Speaker 1>winged messenger of the gods were trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to state psychologically,</v>

56
00:02:36.951 --> 00:02:37.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

57
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.200
<v Speaker 1>your interest flits around.</v>

58
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>captures it and that moves your interest</v>

59
00:02:42.801 --> 00:02:43.940
<v Speaker 1>from place to place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

60
00:02:43.941 --> 00:02:46.550
<v Speaker 1>like if you walk into a bookstore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll get interested in a particular</v>

61
00:02:46.551 --> 00:02:49.820
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's as if the book grips you because</v>

62
00:02:49.821 --> 00:02:51.440
<v Speaker 1>you don't know why you're interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might,</v>

63
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.070
<v Speaker 1>but often you don't know why you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in that book and you know</v>

64
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.110
<v Speaker 1>your interest is flitting around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's mercury.</v>

65
00:02:57.111 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 1>The thing that makes your interests</v>
<v Speaker 1>flick flick around his mercury,</v>

66
00:03:00.101 --> 00:03:04.630
<v Speaker 1>the winged messenger of the gods and</v>
<v Speaker 1>mercury is the messenger of the gods.</v>

67
00:03:04.631 --> 00:03:07.720
<v Speaker 1>Because it's the things behind the</v>
<v Speaker 1>scenes psychologically that are</v>

68
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:11.290
<v Speaker 1>manipulating your attention and for</v>
<v Speaker 1>young those were equivalent in some</v>

69
00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:14.750
<v Speaker 1>sense to the last gods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so for young your,</v>

70
00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.810
<v Speaker 1>your interest was being manipulated</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind the scenes by unseen forces that</v>

71
00:03:19.901 --> 00:03:22.810
<v Speaker 1>were associated with your character or</v>
<v Speaker 1>logical development across time.</v>

72
00:03:22.811 --> 00:03:26.530
<v Speaker 1>That was the manifestation of the self.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the self is this,</v>

73
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.780
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the potential you,</v>

74
00:03:28.781 --> 00:03:31.540
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the way it operates in the present</v>

75
00:03:31.541 --> 00:03:34.180
<v Speaker 1>is by gripping your interest in</v>
<v Speaker 1>directing it somewhere.</v>

76
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.030
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of the instinct of self</v>
<v Speaker 1>realization.</v>

77
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.250
<v Speaker 1>It's a mind boggling idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

78
00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:39.850
<v Speaker 1>Really it's.</v>
