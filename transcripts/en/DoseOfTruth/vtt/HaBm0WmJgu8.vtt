1
00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.940
<v Speaker 1>So that's what a human being is like in terms of his or her output.</v>

2
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:11.080
<v Speaker 1>And so what you see,</v>

3
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.190
<v Speaker 1>if you look at a sensory homonculus it's quite similar except the feet are</v>

4
00:00:15.191 --> 00:00:15.521
<v Speaker 1>bigger.</v>

5
00:00:15.521 --> 00:00:16.810
<v Speaker 1>The Genitalia or bigger,</v>

6
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.360
<v Speaker 1>logically they don't have much motor utility,</v>

7
00:00:19.361 --> 00:00:20.920
<v Speaker 1>but they have a lot of sensory utility.</v>

8
00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.080
<v Speaker 1>But the rest of it's quite similar.</v>

9
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:23.943
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>

10
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:24.221
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:24.221 --> 00:00:26.320
<v Speaker 1>the motor and the sensory homonculus are quite similar.</v>

12
00:00:26.321 --> 00:00:29.500
<v Speaker 1>But I'm going to talk about the motor homonculus because it's sort of the action</v>

13
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.640
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>

14
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.851
<v Speaker 1>While,</v>

15
00:00:30.851 --> 00:00:32.230
<v Speaker 1>so what are human beings like?</v>

16
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:33.693
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

17
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.400
<v Speaker 1>we're all hands.</v>

18
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:37.563
<v Speaker 1>That's the first thing,</v>

19
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:38.111
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

20
00:00:38.111 --> 00:00:38.740
<v Speaker 1>And if you,</v>

21
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.580
<v Speaker 1>if you do that,</v>

22
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.870
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>

23
00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.640
<v Speaker 1>it's unbelievably high resolution.</v>

24
00:00:42.641 --> 00:00:43.540
<v Speaker 1>Your fingertips and,</v>

25
00:00:43.541 --> 00:00:43.870
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

26
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:44.620
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

27
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:45.160
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

28
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.881
<v Speaker 1>that sensory.</v>

29
00:00:45.881 --> 00:00:48.640
<v Speaker 1>But we can manipulate our hands like crazy.</v>

30
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.770
<v Speaker 1>Like they're unbelievably articulated,</v>

31
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.580
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

32
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.920
<v Speaker 1>And that's the thing that makes us able to change the world.</v>

33
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.750
<v Speaker 1>It makes us what dolphins aren't.</v>

34
00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.820
<v Speaker 1>And so a huge part of our brain is devoted towards being able to move our hands.</v>

35
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.010
<v Speaker 1>That enables us to take things apart,</v>

36
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.023
<v Speaker 1>put them together.</v>

37
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.450
<v Speaker 1>And then once we learned to take things apart and put them together,</v>

38
00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.370
<v Speaker 1>we can talk about how we do that.</v>

39
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:10.930
<v Speaker 1>And that's a lot of what we're doing.</v>

40
00:01:10.931 --> 00:01:12.910
<v Speaker 1>And that's the hands and the mouth and the tongue.</v>

41
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:13.773
<v Speaker 1>Roughly speaking.</v>

42
00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.440
<v Speaker 1>Here's how I took something to apart chaos.</v>

43
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.120
<v Speaker 1>Here's what I made out of it.</v>

44
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.870
<v Speaker 1>Order,</v>

45
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:20.950
<v Speaker 1>here's how I did it.</v>

46
00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.280
<v Speaker 1>And then you receive that and you're happy about it.</v>

47
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.900
<v Speaker 1>And then you can do the same thing.</v>

48
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.370
<v Speaker 1>And that's imitation.</v>

49
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.260
<v Speaker 1>It's facilitated by language.</v>

50
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.891
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

51
00:01:29.891 --> 00:01:31.330
<v Speaker 1>here's what I did with my body.</v>

52
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm propagating the cross space.</v>

53
00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:35.890
<v Speaker 1>You're taking it,</v>

54
00:01:35.891 --> 00:01:37.270
<v Speaker 1>mapping it onto your body.</v>

55
00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:38.680
<v Speaker 1>Now you can do the same thing.</v>

56
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:39.161
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

57
00:01:39.161 --> 00:01:39.850
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

58
00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:40.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

59
00:01:40.061 --> 00:01:42.610
<v Speaker 1>it might be simple like this is how you pick up a rock,</v>

60
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.020
<v Speaker 1>but it might be complicated.</v>

61
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.170
<v Speaker 1>Like here's how you go after the dragon of chaos.</v>

62
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.861
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

63
00:01:47.861 --> 00:01:51.340
<v Speaker 1>And so that's it sort of maps onto that hierarchy.</v>

64
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.970
<v Speaker 1>This thing we've talked about in some detail,</v>

65
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.313
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

66
00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.030
<v Speaker 1>when you're telling a story to people,</v>

67
00:01:58.031 --> 00:01:59.710
<v Speaker 1>when you're informing them about something,</v>

68
00:01:59.711 --> 00:02:02.500
<v Speaker 1>you can talk to them at a very high level of resolution,</v>

69
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.850
<v Speaker 1>which you do with your child.</v>

70
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.400
<v Speaker 1>Here's how you slice up some Broccoli,</v>

71
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.510
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

72
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.400
<v Speaker 1>But then you move up the obstruction and say,</v>

73
00:02:09.401 --> 00:02:12.130
<v Speaker 1>here's how you act like a civilized person at the dinner table.</v>

74
00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:13.091
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

75
00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:14.770
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of being a good person.</v>

76
00:02:14.771 --> 00:02:16.240
<v Speaker 1>So you can tell stories about,</v>

77
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.980
<v Speaker 1>I just went and saw Logan,</v>

78
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:19.630
<v Speaker 1>which I really liked by the way,</v>

79
00:02:19.631 --> 00:02:20.411
<v Speaker 1>it's super violent,</v>

80
00:02:20.411 --> 00:02:21.340
<v Speaker 1>but I really did like it.</v>

81
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:22.160
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

82
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.993
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

83
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.310
<v Speaker 1>it's got a very elegant,</v>

84
00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:25.300
<v Speaker 1>mythological structure,</v>

85
00:02:25.301 --> 00:02:26.320
<v Speaker 1>which is not surprising,</v>

86
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.453
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

87
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

88
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.440
<v Speaker 1>there's a scene in this Logan movie.</v>

89
00:02:29.441 --> 00:02:29.790
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

90
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:30.160
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

91
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.620
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

92
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

93
00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:31.810
<v Speaker 1>it's not a spoiler.</v>

94
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.680
<v Speaker 1>He has this child with him who has not been,</v>

95
00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.900
<v Speaker 1>who's been raised roughly in a laboratory,</v>

96
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.420
<v Speaker 1>and she has absolutely no table manners.</v>

97
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.920
<v Speaker 1>And so they're sitting at a dinner with some people that they've run into and</v>

98
00:02:44.921 --> 00:02:46.930
<v Speaker 1>she's eating like a total barbarian.</v>

99
00:02:46.931 --> 00:02:47.351
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>

100
00:02:47.351 --> 00:02:48.790
<v Speaker 1>everybody's eyebrows,</v>

101
00:02:48.791 --> 00:02:49.211
<v Speaker 1>her race.</v>

102
00:02:49.211 --> 00:02:50.020
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

103
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.340
<v Speaker 1>where did this person come from?</v>

104
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.520
<v Speaker 1>So that the fact that that high order behavior isn't there is something that's</v>

105
00:02:56.691 --> 00:02:58.240
<v Speaker 1>acts of extraordinary interest.</v>

106
00:02:58.241 --> 00:02:59.050
<v Speaker 1>Everyone.</v>

107
00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.711
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>

108
00:02:59.711 --> 00:02:59.881
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

109
00:02:59.881 --> 00:03:04.390
<v Speaker 1>you teach your children micro strategies and you teach the macro strategies and</v>

110
00:03:04.391 --> 00:03:06.250
<v Speaker 1>some of the macro strategies you're teaching them,</v>

111
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.490
<v Speaker 1>you don't even understand because you know,</v>

112
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.240
<v Speaker 1>you know the strategies they're built into you because of an evolutionary</v>

113
00:03:13.241 --> 00:03:13.721
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>

114
00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:14.554
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>

115
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.740
<v Speaker 1>And you say things like it doesn't matter whether you win or lose,</v>

116
00:03:17.741 --> 00:03:20.910
<v Speaker 1>it matters how you play the game and you don't understand what that means.</v>

117
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.610
<v Speaker 1>Although you know it's right and you try to act that out for your children and</v>

118
00:03:24.611 --> 00:03:26.860
<v Speaker 1>they incorporate it in their action,</v>

119
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.480
<v Speaker 1>even though they can't represent it,</v>

120
00:03:28.481 --> 00:03:33.160
<v Speaker 1>they cannot come up with a fully articulated representation of what that means.</v>

121
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.360
<v Speaker 1>And so they're like children,</v>

122
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:35.560
<v Speaker 1>the Piaget and children.</v>

123
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.000
<v Speaker 1>Children can only play by themselves to begin with while they're integrating</v>

124
00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:40.990
<v Speaker 1>themselves internally.</v>

125
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.260
<v Speaker 1>Then they start to play in parallel with other children.</v>

126
00:03:44.261 --> 00:03:45.094
<v Speaker 1>So you'll,</v>

127
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:46.043
<v Speaker 1>you're to,</v>

128
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.013
<v Speaker 1>you play your game,</v>

129
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.960
<v Speaker 1>that child plays his or her gape little interaction,</v>

130
00:03:49.961 --> 00:03:51.610
<v Speaker 1>but you can't unite the games.</v>

131
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.100
<v Speaker 1>Then you're between two and four.</v>

132
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.230
<v Speaker 1>You start to be able to unite the games.</v>

133
00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.300
<v Speaker 1>And you can either do that by acting them out.</v>

134
00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.931
<v Speaker 1>You can do this.</v>

135
00:03:58.931 --> 00:04:00.010
<v Speaker 1>Even with the younger child,</v>

136
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.080
<v Speaker 1>they can catch peekaboo very rapidly.</v>

137
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.070
<v Speaker 1>But once you're between two and four and you start getting linguistic,</v>

138
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.121
<v Speaker 1>you could start saying,</v>

139
00:04:07.121 --> 00:04:07.271
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

140
00:04:07.271 --> 00:04:11.830
<v Speaker 1>let's play this game and that means we're going to unite our attention towards a</v>

141
00:04:11.831 --> 00:04:12.760
<v Speaker 1>particular goal.</v>

142
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.020
<v Speaker 1>We're going to unite our motor activity and maybe cooperate and compete towards</v>

143
00:04:17.021 --> 00:04:17.710
<v Speaker 1>that goal.</v>

144
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:20.470
<v Speaker 1>So beginning of of the social structure,</v>

145
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.010
<v Speaker 1>it's the beginning of the social structure and you get really good at that</v>

146
00:04:24.011 --> 00:04:25.090
<v Speaker 1>between two and four,</v>

147
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.790
<v Speaker 1>but you don't necessarily know what you're doing.</v>

148
00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:28.930
<v Speaker 1>You can't say it.</v>

149
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.800
<v Speaker 1>So Piaget's experiments indicated that if you take children,</v>

150
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.650
<v Speaker 1>maybe they've got to the point where they can play quite a social game.</v>

151
00:04:35.651 --> 00:04:36.850
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there are five or six,</v>

152
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:37.870
<v Speaker 1>they're playing marbles.</v>

153
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.060
<v Speaker 1>You take them out of the game and you say,</v>

154
00:04:40.061 --> 00:04:40.301
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

155
00:04:40.301 --> 00:04:42.010
<v Speaker 1>tell me the rules of the game of marbles.</v>

156
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.410
<v Speaker 1>They give incoherent representations.</v>

157
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:45.573
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

158
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.240
<v Speaker 1>Because their behavior is more sophisticated than their representation.</v>

159
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.460
<v Speaker 1>You see as soon as you understand that,</v>

160
00:04:51.461 --> 00:04:54.790
<v Speaker 1>that is a wild thing to understand because it answers the question.</v>

161
00:04:54.791 --> 00:04:55.624
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

162
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.410
<v Speaker 1>how can you have dreams that tells you things you don't know?</v>

163
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.701
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>

164
00:05:00.701 --> 00:05:00.851
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

165
00:05:00.851 --> 00:05:02.410
<v Speaker 1>how the hell can that possibly be?</v>

166
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.300
<v Speaker 1>You're coming up with the damn dream.</v>

167
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.820
<v Speaker 1>How can the dream tell you things you don't know?</v>

168
00:05:06.821 --> 00:05:08.320
<v Speaker 1>Or analogously.</v>

169
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.460
<v Speaker 1>How can people tell stories that contain information that they don't understand</v>

170
00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.120
<v Speaker 1>and answer is the information is coded in our behavior.</v>

171
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.841
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

172
00:05:16.841 --> 00:05:18.700
<v Speaker 1>so we'll go back to a chimpanzee troop.</v>

173
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.760
<v Speaker 1>All the chimpanzees in the troop?</v>

174
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.600
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

175
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.070
<v Speaker 1>the dominance hierarchy structure.</v>

176
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.300
<v Speaker 1>But if you take a chimpanzee out from the troop and say,</v>

177
00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.370
<v Speaker 1>what's the dominant structure?</v>

178
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.060
<v Speaker 1>The chimpanzee is going to do whatever a chimpanzee does,</v>

179
00:05:34.061 --> 00:05:38.110
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to have a little conversation with you about the nature of the</v>

180
00:05:38.111 --> 00:05:38.950
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy.</v>

181
00:05:38.951 --> 00:05:43.510
<v Speaker 1>So it can act out its knowledge and it might even be able to represent it an</v>

182
00:05:43.511 --> 00:05:44.344
<v Speaker 1>image,</v>

183
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.710
<v Speaker 1>but it can't articulate it.</v>

184
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:48.851
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

185
00:05:48.851 --> 00:05:50.170
<v Speaker 1>why would we be any different?</v>

186
00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:51.730
<v Speaker 1>We aren't obviously,</v>

187
00:05:51.731 --> 00:05:53.860
<v Speaker 1>because we're more complex than we understand.</v>

188
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.740
<v Speaker 1>So the fact that we're more complex than we understand means that we contain</v>

189
00:05:57.741 --> 00:05:59.960
<v Speaker 1>information that we cannot articulate.</v>

190
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.850
<v Speaker 1>Why can't that reveal itself?</v>

191
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:02.810
<v Speaker 1>It does all the time.</v>

192
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.580
<v Speaker 1>You have a revelation.</v>

193
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:06.253
<v Speaker 1>Aha,</v>

194
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:07.603
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

195
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:08.061
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

196
00:06:08.061 --> 00:06:08.894
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>

197
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.600
<v Speaker 1>It's you.</v>

198
00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.820
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're in psychotherapy,</v>

199
00:06:10.821 --> 00:06:12.740
<v Speaker 1>and we talk about some things about your past,</v>

200
00:06:12.741 --> 00:06:13.071
<v Speaker 1>and we say,</v>

201
00:06:13.071 --> 00:06:13.221
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

202
00:06:13.221 --> 00:06:13.791
<v Speaker 1>this happened.</v>

203
00:06:13.791 --> 00:06:14.451
<v Speaker 1>Then this happened,</v>

204
00:06:14.451 --> 00:06:15.284
<v Speaker 1>then this happened.</v>

205
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:15.651
<v Speaker 1>We say,</v>

206
00:06:15.651 --> 00:06:15.891
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

207
00:06:15.891 --> 00:06:16.640
<v Speaker 1>there's a pattern.</v>

208
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.473
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

209
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:18.740
<v Speaker 1>And it's overwhelming.</v>

210
00:06:18.741 --> 00:06:22.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like now there's a concordance between your knowledge and the things that</v>

211
00:06:22.251 --> 00:06:23.090
<v Speaker 1>you're acting out,</v>

212
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.070
<v Speaker 1>and that's what comes as a revelation.</v>

213
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.040
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that happens in exodus,</v>

214
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.140
<v Speaker 1>Moses is leading his people through the deserts.</v>

215
00:06:30.141 --> 00:06:31.850
<v Speaker 1>Classic you shaped story.</v>

216
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.410
<v Speaker 1>They're in a tyranny to begin with,</v>

217
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:34.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

218
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.843
<v Speaker 1>So that's the,</v>

219
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:36.530
<v Speaker 1>that's the insufficient present.</v>

220
00:06:36.531 --> 00:06:37.790
<v Speaker 1>That's the old order.</v>

221
00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:39.740
<v Speaker 1>Then they crossed the water,</v>

222
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:40.940
<v Speaker 1>the destructive water.</v>

223
00:06:40.941 --> 00:06:41.660
<v Speaker 1>That's chaos.</v>

224
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:42.470
<v Speaker 1>Like the flood.</v>

225
00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.640
<v Speaker 1>Then they're out in the desert wandering without direction.</v>

226
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:47.030
<v Speaker 1>They start worshiping idols,</v>

227
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.860
<v Speaker 1>they're wandering without direction.</v>

228
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.400
<v Speaker 1>And then Moses goes up on the mountain,</v>

229
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:54.171
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

230
00:06:54.171 --> 00:06:54.561
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

231
00:06:54.561 --> 00:06:55.580
<v Speaker 1>what happens in Logan,</v>

232
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:57.410
<v Speaker 1>just because if you're going to go see it,</v>

233
00:06:57.411 --> 00:06:59.930
<v Speaker 1>you might as well know that because it's a journey up the mountain.</v>

234
00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:01.263
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

235
00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.070
<v Speaker 1>he goes up the mountain and he gets rules revealed to them.</v>

236
00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:04.731
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

237
00:07:04.731 --> 00:07:06.110
<v Speaker 1>the way the story is structured,</v>

238
00:07:06.111 --> 00:07:11.111
<v Speaker 1>it's extraordinarily interesting because Moses takes us people away from this</v>

239
00:07:11.151 --> 00:07:11.660
<v Speaker 1>tyranny,</v>

240
00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:12.710
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical structure,</v>

241
00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:17.980
<v Speaker 1>but they don't go from tyranny to paradise to the promise land in one move.</v>

242
00:07:18.531 --> 00:07:19.520
<v Speaker 1>That isn't how it works.</v>

243
00:07:19.521 --> 00:07:20.330
<v Speaker 1>They have to,</v>

244
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:24.230
<v Speaker 1>they go from a tyranny to absolute chaos where everyone is fighting and killing</v>

245
00:07:24.231 --> 00:07:27.830
<v Speaker 1>each other and having a terrible time of it and half starving and,</v>

246
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.170
<v Speaker 1>and having to pass through the Red Sea.</v>

247
00:07:30.171 --> 00:07:30.860
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>

248
00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:35.750
<v Speaker 1>they go from tyranny to catastrophe before they go to higher order.</v>

249
00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:38.480
<v Speaker 1>And Moses doesn't even make it to the place of higher order.</v>

250
00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:40.640
<v Speaker 1>He dies before he gets there.</v>

251
00:07:40.641 --> 00:07:41.001
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

252
00:07:41.001 --> 00:07:42.240
<v Speaker 1>it's quite the catastrophe.</v>

253
00:07:42.241 --> 00:07:45.740
<v Speaker 1>And the Israelites are all confused when they're out in the desert because even</v>

254
00:07:45.741 --> 00:07:47.510
<v Speaker 1>though they were in a tyranny and they were slaves,</v>

255
00:07:47.511 --> 00:07:49.550
<v Speaker 1>now they're nowhere and they don't know anything.</v>

256
00:07:49.551 --> 00:07:50.510
<v Speaker 1>It's not good.</v>

257
00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:54.950
<v Speaker 1>And so a lot of them actually start thinking about how good the damn tyranny was</v>

258
00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:56.840
<v Speaker 1>compared to wandering around in the desert,</v>

259
00:07:56.841 --> 00:07:58.820
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what happened to the Soviet Union,</v>

260
00:07:58.850 --> 00:07:59.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

261
00:07:59.120 --> 00:07:59.631
<v Speaker 1>In Russia.</v>

262
00:07:59.631 --> 00:08:03.170
<v Speaker 1>Now there's huge nostalgia for the Stalinist era.</v>

263
00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:05.150
<v Speaker 1>So these stories,</v>

264
00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:05.370
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

265
00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:06.530
<v Speaker 1>they're always true.</v>

266
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:07.640
<v Speaker 1>They're always happening.</v>

267
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.410
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

268
00:08:09.411 --> 00:08:12.590
<v Speaker 1>what happens to Moses is that the story is quite interesting.</v>

269
00:08:12.591 --> 00:08:15.500
<v Speaker 1>So the Israelites start to fight amongst themselves,</v>

270
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:18.920
<v Speaker 1>which of course they do because there's no higher order authority.</v>

271
00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:23.780
<v Speaker 1>And so then Moses sits and judges like literally like a judge.</v>

272
00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:27.650
<v Speaker 1>He sits for hours every day and the squabbling Israelites come up and say,</v>

273
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:28.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

274
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.570
<v Speaker 1>he did this to me and no,</v>

275
00:08:29.571 --> 00:08:30.590
<v Speaker 1>you did this to me.</v>

276
00:08:30.591 --> 00:08:30.860
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

277
00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:33.920
<v Speaker 1>and so then Moses has to figure out who's right and who's wrong.</v>

278
00:08:33.921 --> 00:08:37.130
<v Speaker 1>And he's doing this for like hours and hours for days and days,</v>

279
00:08:37.131 --> 00:08:38.060
<v Speaker 1>for weeks and weeks,</v>

280
00:08:38.061 --> 00:08:38.930
<v Speaker 1>for months.</v>

281
00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:41.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like the origin of English common law.</v>

282
00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:44.870
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly what happened with common law because in common law,</v>

283
00:08:44.871 --> 00:08:47.330
<v Speaker 1>what happens is that you have all the rights.</v>

284
00:08:47.331 --> 00:08:48.080
<v Speaker 1>There are,</v>

285
00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.370
<v Speaker 1>if you to have a dispute,</v>

286
00:08:49.371 --> 00:08:50.870
<v Speaker 1>you go before the judiciary,</v>

287
00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.010
<v Speaker 1>you sort out the dispute.</v>

288
00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.240
<v Speaker 1>That becomes a precedent.</v>

289
00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:53.511
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

290
00:08:53.511 --> 00:08:55.620
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the body of laws.</v>

291
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.260
<v Speaker 1>The body of laws is what you act out.</v>

292
00:08:58.290 --> 00:08:59.340
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's a body.</v>

293
00:08:59.820 --> 00:08:59.971
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

294
00:08:59.971 --> 00:09:01.080
<v Speaker 1>that's what Moses does.</v>

295
00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:04.140
<v Speaker 1>So he's sitting there making judgments.</v>

296
00:09:04.141 --> 00:09:04.471
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

297
00:09:04.471 --> 00:09:06.330
<v Speaker 1>very finely tuned,</v>

298
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:08.190
<v Speaker 1>discrete moral judgements.</v>

299
00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:11.730
<v Speaker 1>You know how difficult that is when two people have a dispute to try to figure</v>

300
00:09:11.731 --> 00:09:13.110
<v Speaker 1>out how to mediate between that?</v>

301
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:14.160
<v Speaker 1>You don't know who's lying,</v>

302
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:15.390
<v Speaker 1>who's telling the truth.</v>

303
00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.390
<v Speaker 1>You don't know exactly what an acceptable solution would be like.</v>

304
00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:20.520
<v Speaker 1>It's really ridiculously hard work.</v>

305
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:25.880
<v Speaker 1>So he walks through this entire process of continual judicial intermediation.</v>

306
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:28.350
<v Speaker 1>Then he goes up the mountain and what does he get?</v>

307
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.760
<v Speaker 1>Tablet of rules.</v>

308
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:30.181
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

309
00:09:30.181 --> 00:09:31.014
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

310
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:31.501
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

311
00:09:31.501 --> 00:09:36.501
<v Speaker 1>he spent his 10,000 hours investigating the structure of morality in a practical</v>

312
00:09:38.281 --> 00:09:38.970
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

313
00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:39.600
<v Speaker 1>and it goes,</v>

314
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.433
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>

315
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:42.540
<v Speaker 1>this is what we've been doing.</v>

316
00:09:42.541 --> 00:09:44.040
<v Speaker 1>These are the rules.</v>

317
00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:47.310
<v Speaker 1>It's not like there's no rules to begin with and don'ts.</v>

318
00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:49.650
<v Speaker 1>Those are imposed because that wouldn't work.</v>

319
00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.150
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work that way.</v>

320
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.270
<v Speaker 1>You have to take how people are,</v>

321
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:59.070
<v Speaker 1>extract out what the pattern of what they are is reflect that back to them.</v>

322
00:09:59.100 --> 00:09:59.580
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>

323
00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.290
<v Speaker 1>that's the story of Moses and it's,</v>

324
00:10:01.291 --> 00:10:01.740
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

325
00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:02.460
<v Speaker 1>it's a myth.</v>

326
00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:03.490
<v Speaker 1>It's a metal story.</v>

327
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:06.330
<v Speaker 1>It's a story about how rules come to be.</v>

328
00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:08.040
<v Speaker 1>We act a certain way.</v>

329
00:10:08.041 --> 00:10:09.720
<v Speaker 1>We have certain kinds of expectations.</v>

330
00:10:09.721 --> 00:10:11.880
<v Speaker 1>We have certain kinds of disputes out of that,</v>

331
00:10:11.881 --> 00:10:12.600
<v Speaker 1>a pattern,</v>

332
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.390
<v Speaker 1>a pattern way of being emerges.</v>

333
00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.520
<v Speaker 1>Then we map the pattern way of being.</v>

334
00:10:17.521 --> 00:10:17.761
<v Speaker 1>We say,</v>

335
00:10:17.761 --> 00:10:18.091
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>

336
00:10:18.091 --> 00:10:18.924
<v Speaker 1>here's the rules.</v>

337
00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:22.740
<v Speaker 1>There's 10 of them or however many you want to extract.</v>

338
00:10:22.741 --> 00:10:22.951
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

339
00:10:22.951 --> 00:10:23.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

340
00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:25.320
<v Speaker 1>it's a moving target in some sense.</v>

341
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:26.850
<v Speaker 1>Don't kill other people.</v>

342
00:10:26.851 --> 00:10:27.810
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad idea.</v>

343
00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:30.150
<v Speaker 1>Don't steal what other people have,</v>

344
00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:31.590
<v Speaker 1>honor your parents,</v>

345
00:10:31.591 --> 00:10:32.101
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

346
00:10:32.101 --> 00:10:32.581
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

347
00:10:32.581 --> 00:10:32.821
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

348
00:10:32.821 --> 00:10:33.360
<v Speaker 1>these are,</v>

349
00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.390
<v Speaker 1>you could come up with a different basic set of rules,</v>

350
00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:39.420
<v Speaker 1>but there'd be some overlap and those aren't bad to begin with.</v>

351
00:10:39.421 --> 00:10:40.980
<v Speaker 1>Kirsten were far more rules than that,</v>

352
00:10:40.981 --> 00:10:42.300
<v Speaker 1>but those were the central ones.</v>

353
00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:43.920
<v Speaker 1>And so then he might say,</v>

354
00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:45.450
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

355
00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:50.450
<v Speaker 1>if you took all 10 of those rules and you tried to extract out one rule from</v>

356
00:10:50.461 --> 00:10:51.294
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

357
00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:53.370
<v Speaker 1>that would be at the top of the hierarchy,</v>

358
00:10:53.371 --> 00:10:54.300
<v Speaker 1>what would that be?</v>

359
00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:55.800
<v Speaker 1>And in Western culture,</v>

360
00:10:55.801 --> 00:10:59.400
<v Speaker 1>the idea there is that do unto others as you would have them do unto you,</v>

361
00:10:59.401 --> 00:11:02.910
<v Speaker 1>is the rule that it's the matter rule that guides all other rules.</v>

362
00:11:02.911 --> 00:11:04.350
<v Speaker 1>Sorta like the one ring in the,</v>

363
00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:05.730
<v Speaker 1>in the Lord of the rings.</v>
