1
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.970
<v Speaker 1>And the seven years of plenty of snus that was in the land of Egypt branded in</v>

2
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.580
<v Speaker 1>the seven years of dearth began to come according as Joseph has said,</v>

3
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.300
<v Speaker 1>and a dearth was in all the lands.</v>

4
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:19.793
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.480
<v Speaker 1>that's an archetypal story,</v>

6
00:00:21.481 --> 00:00:22.314
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

7
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.020
<v Speaker 1>The archetypal story to the business cycle story.</v>

8
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.810
<v Speaker 1>It's a little harsher when you're starving,</v>

9
00:00:27.811 --> 00:00:28.381
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>

10
00:00:28.381 --> 00:00:29.370
<v Speaker 1>but that's not the point.</v>

11
00:00:29.371 --> 00:00:33.470
<v Speaker 1>The point is is that sometimes things are getting good and sometimes things are</v>

12
00:00:33.471 --> 00:00:35.420
<v Speaker 1>getting bad and that's,</v>

13
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.840
<v Speaker 1>you can be sure that that's the case that's going to happen to you and so the</v>

14
00:00:39.841 --> 00:00:44.841
<v Speaker 1>wise person takes stock of the fact that things are going to get bad is this is</v>

15
00:00:45.451 --> 00:00:47.250
<v Speaker 1>the same thing that happens with Noah.</v>

16
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.320
<v Speaker 1>It's like assume the flood because it's going to happen and you think,</v>

17
00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:52.471
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

18
00:00:52.471 --> 00:00:54.000
<v Speaker 1>it's a hell of a world that has floods.</v>

19
00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:55.500
<v Speaker 1>It's like not if you have a boat.</v>

20
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.353
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

21
00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:58.620
<v Speaker 1>It helps a lot.</v>

22
00:00:58.621 --> 00:00:58.861
<v Speaker 1>If he,</v>

23
00:00:58.861 --> 00:01:00.240
<v Speaker 1>if there's a flood and you have a boat,</v>

24
00:01:00.241 --> 00:01:03.900
<v Speaker 1>it's like you can float on the flood and then it's not such a problem.</v>

25
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.090
<v Speaker 1>And so if you</v>

26
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.590
<v Speaker 1>refuse to look at the fact that things are going to be going downhill badly and</v>

27
00:01:13.921 --> 00:01:15.870
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to be in a pit at some point,</v>

28
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.090
<v Speaker 1>you and your family perhaps then</v>

29
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.511
<v Speaker 1>when it happens,</v>

30
00:01:20.511 --> 00:01:22.700
<v Speaker 1>it will be as bad as it possibly can be.</v>

31
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.510
<v Speaker 1>But if you're awake and alert to that possibility,</v>

32
00:01:27.511 --> 00:01:29.670
<v Speaker 1>then you can mitigate it.</v>

33
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.640
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

34
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.900
<v Speaker 1>And the dearth was in all the lands,</v>

35
00:01:34.901 --> 00:01:36.070
<v Speaker 1>but in the land of Egypt,</v>

36
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.893
<v Speaker 1>there was bread.</v>

37
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.700
<v Speaker 1>And when the land of Egypt was famished,</v>

38
00:01:39.701 --> 00:01:41.140
<v Speaker 1>the people cried to Pharaoh for bread.</v>

39
00:01:41.141 --> 00:01:42.970
<v Speaker 1>And Pharaoh said unto the Egyptians,</v>

40
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.760
<v Speaker 1>go to Joseph what he says to you to do.</v>

41
00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:46.630
<v Speaker 1>You do that.</v>

42
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.090
<v Speaker 1>And the famine was all over the face of the earth.</v>

43
00:01:49.091 --> 00:01:53.200
<v Speaker 1>And Joe Boo Josef opened up the store houses and sold to the Egyptians and the</v>

44
00:01:53.201 --> 00:01:57.820
<v Speaker 1>famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt and all the countries came into Egypt to</v>

45
00:01:57.821 --> 00:02:02.821
<v Speaker 1>buy to Joseph to buy corn because the famine was sore in all the lands.</v>

46
00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.060
<v Speaker 1>Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt,</v>

47
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.860
<v Speaker 1>Jacob said unto his sons,</v>

48
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.910
<v Speaker 1>why are you standing around looking at each other?</v>

49
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.660
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

50
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.220
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that there's corn in Egypt,</v>

51
00:02:14.221 --> 00:02:19.221
<v Speaker 1>get down there and I from a buy for us so that we may live and not die.</v>

52
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.450
<v Speaker 1>It's like pretty straightforward advice that,</v>

53
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.250
<v Speaker 1>and Joseph's 10 brothers went down to buy corn in Egypt,</v>

54
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.890
<v Speaker 1>but Benjamin Joseph's brother,</v>

55
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.090
<v Speaker 1>that's the youngest one,</v>

56
00:02:30.091 --> 00:02:30.301
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

57
00:02:30.301 --> 00:02:31.131
<v Speaker 1>The only one left.</v>

58
00:02:31.131 --> 00:02:33.390
<v Speaker 1>It's the one that was younger than Joseph,</v>

59
00:02:33.391 --> 00:02:36.840
<v Speaker 1>the only youngest one and also Rachael's other suck.</v>

60
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.950
<v Speaker 1>But Jeff Benjamin,</v>

61
00:02:37.951 --> 00:02:42.951
<v Speaker 1>Joseph's brother Jacob didn't send because he was worried that something bad</v>

62
00:02:43.771 --> 00:02:44.461
<v Speaker 1>would happen to them,</v>

63
00:02:44.461 --> 00:02:48.810
<v Speaker 1>which kind of indicates to me that maybe Jacob was a bit suspicious about what</v>

64
00:02:48.811 --> 00:02:53.811
<v Speaker 1>had happened to Joseph the last time he sent all the brothers on a adventure and</v>

65
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.520
<v Speaker 1>Joseph was the governor.</v>

66
00:02:56.521 --> 00:02:57.570
<v Speaker 1>Over all the land and,</v>

67
00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.701
<v Speaker 1>and he,</v>

68
00:02:58.701 --> 00:03:02.320
<v Speaker 1>it was sold to all the people of the land in Joseph's brothers came and bowed</v>

69
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:04.930
<v Speaker 1>down themselves before him with their faces to the earth.</v>

70
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.370
<v Speaker 1>While there's the dream.</v>

71
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.130
<v Speaker 1>Now the thing is too,</v>

72
00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:09.964
<v Speaker 1>is that</v>

73
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.950
<v Speaker 1>one question you have in your life is who should you bow down to?</v>

74
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.121
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>

75
00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:16.954
<v Speaker 1>no one,</v>

76
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.410
<v Speaker 1>that's not exactly the right answer because that means that you don't have an</v>

77
00:03:20.411 --> 00:03:22.480
<v Speaker 1>ideal because you bow down to your ideal.</v>

78
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:23.890
<v Speaker 1>That's what makes it an ideal.</v>

79
00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:24.910
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't have an ideal,</v>

80
00:03:24.911 --> 00:03:26.230
<v Speaker 1>then what the hell are you going to do?</v>

81
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.090
<v Speaker 1>So you have to bow down to something.</v>

82
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.340
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens here as well,</v>

83
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.780
<v Speaker 1>the brothers are bowing down to the person who is so bloody resilient and</v>

84
00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:38.260
<v Speaker 1>competent that they can take themselves out of a prison and become the ruler of</v>

85
00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:38.800
<v Speaker 1>the land.</v>

86
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.360
<v Speaker 1>That happened to Vaclav Havel,</v>

87
00:03:40.361 --> 00:03:40.631
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

88
00:03:40.631 --> 00:03:41.500
<v Speaker 1>In Czechoslovakia.</v>

89
00:03:41.501 --> 00:03:42.580
<v Speaker 1>It also happened to</v>

90
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.640
<v Speaker 1>Mandela in South Africa.</v>

91
00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.590
<v Speaker 1>These things actually happen.</v>

92
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.180
<v Speaker 1>It's really something.</v>

93
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.760
<v Speaker 1>So God only knows what you might learn in prison.</v>
