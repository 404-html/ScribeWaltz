1
00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:11.460
<v Speaker 1>And then what seems to go along with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is something like truth in</v>

2
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.380
<v Speaker 1>conception and action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.270
<v Speaker 1>even people like Jacob who are pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>damn morally ambivalent to begin with,</v>

4
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.940
<v Speaker 1>get hammered a lot by what they go</v>
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>

5
00:00:21.941 --> 00:00:25.540
<v Speaker 1>And what seems to happen is that they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>hammered into some sort of ethical</v>

6
00:00:25.541 --> 00:00:26.380
<v Speaker 1>shape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

7
00:00:26.381 --> 00:00:29.290
<v Speaker 1>So by the mid point of their life's</v>
<v Speaker 1>journey,</v>

8
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.460
<v Speaker 1>there are people who are solidly planted</v>
<v Speaker 1>who you can trust and who don't betray</v>

9
00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.960
<v Speaker 1>being or themselves or their fellow</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt.</v>

10
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.240
<v Speaker 1>And so it's an interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean</v>

11
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.270
<v Speaker 1>it seems reasonable to me to first</v>
<v Speaker 1>assume that you have to establish a</v>

12
00:00:48.061 --> 00:00:50.010
<v Speaker 1>relationship with something that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>transcendent.</v>

13
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.830
<v Speaker 1>It might even be just the future version</v>
<v Speaker 1>of you.</v>

14
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.350
<v Speaker 1>And then second that you have to align</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself with reality in a truthful</v>

15
00:00:58.351 --> 00:01:00.720
<v Speaker 1>manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that that's your best bet.</v>

16
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.800
<v Speaker 1>And</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biblical stories are actually quite</v>

17
00:01:06.801 --> 00:01:10.250
<v Speaker 1>realistic about that too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they don't really say that if</v>

18
00:01:10.251 --> 00:01:13.100
<v Speaker 1>you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be instantly transported</v>

19
00:01:13.101 --> 00:01:15.020
<v Speaker 1>to the promised land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like even Moses,</v>

20
00:01:15.021 --> 00:01:16.520
<v Speaker 1>as we'll find out in the accident,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his stories,</v>

21
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.740
<v Speaker 1>he never makes it to the promised land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's not like you're offered</v>

22
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.560
<v Speaker 1>instantaneous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>final redemption.</v>

23
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.350
<v Speaker 1>If you move out forthrightly into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

24
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.680
<v Speaker 1>establish a faithful relationship with</v>
<v Speaker 1>being and attempt to conduct yourself</v>

25
00:01:33.591 --> 00:01:37.160
<v Speaker 1>with integrity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's your best bet and it might be</v>

26
00:01:37.161 --> 00:01:39.710
<v Speaker 1>good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even if it's not good enough,</v>

27
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.650
<v Speaker 1>it's really preferable to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative,</v>

28
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.980
<v Speaker 1>which seems to be something closely akin</v>
<v Speaker 1>to hell,</v>

29
00:01:45.981 --> 00:01:47.420
<v Speaker 1>both personal and social.</v>
