1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.550
<v Speaker 1>It seems that we've moved away from introspection and I think we are finding</v>

2
00:00:04.551 --> 00:00:09.440
<v Speaker 1>that the short term stimulus are pursuing sense pleasures is not making up for</v>

3
00:00:09.441 --> 00:00:11.090
<v Speaker 1>the increasing hollowing out.</v>

4
00:00:11.091 --> 00:00:12.920
<v Speaker 1>I think of people's inner experiences.</v>

5
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:14.381
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6
00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:19.000
<v Speaker 2>Well two things that that you said there that that that struck a chord with me.</v>

7
00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:20.110
<v Speaker 2>The first was that</v>

8
00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.650
<v Speaker 2>with regards to external stimulation,</v>

9
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.710
<v Speaker 2>the question is is that if you're continually bombarded by the outside world,</v>

10
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.790
<v Speaker 2>it's telling you what to do all the time.</v>

11
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.030
<v Speaker 2>I gather people are always telling you what to do when they talk to you.</v>

12
00:00:34.031 --> 00:00:39.031
<v Speaker 2>And of course advertisers and social media are really like seriously and</v>

13
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.710
<v Speaker 2>explicitly telling you what to do.</v>

14
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.330
<v Speaker 2>And the question is,</v>

15
00:00:43.331 --> 00:00:43.601
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

16
00:00:43.601 --> 00:00:47.230
<v Speaker 2>how do you decide what you should do for you?</v>

17
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.580
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to that is that you have to consult yourself.</v>

18
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.320
<v Speaker 2>And unless there's time to do that and you consult yourself partly through the</v>

19
00:00:56.321 --> 00:00:57.730
<v Speaker 2>use of your imagination,</v>

20
00:00:57.731 --> 00:01:01.780
<v Speaker 2>daydreaming and daydreaming about what the future might hold and then actually</v>

21
00:01:01.781 --> 00:01:03.610
<v Speaker 2>consciously thinking about it in planning.</v>

22
00:01:03.611 --> 00:01:07.300
<v Speaker 2>But you need to disconnect yourself from the external stimulation in order to do</v>

23
00:01:07.301 --> 00:01:07.540
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

24
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.820
<v Speaker 2>And it might take some time and so yes,</v>

25
00:01:09.821 --> 00:01:11.800
<v Speaker 2>I think that we're in danger of losing now.</v>

26
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.600
<v Speaker 2>I think children are in danger of having their play interfered with two and we</v>

27
00:01:16.601 --> 00:01:18.580
<v Speaker 2>don't know what the consequences of that would be,</v>

28
00:01:18.581 --> 00:01:22.750
<v Speaker 2>but I don't suspect that it will be the too much of that will be,</v>

29
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:23.530
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

30
00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.660
<v Speaker 2>if that happens to to graded degree,</v>

31
00:01:25.661 --> 00:01:27.220
<v Speaker 2>the consequences will be negative.</v>

32
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.410
<v Speaker 2>And you also mentioned prayer,</v>

33
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.420
<v Speaker 2>you know the,</v>

34
00:01:31.421 --> 00:01:36.010
<v Speaker 2>the cynical attitude towards prayer is something like asking God for favors.</v>

35
00:01:36.011 --> 00:01:40.450
<v Speaker 2>And then of course the cynical analysis of that is that if you ask God for</v>

36
00:01:40.451 --> 00:01:41.284
<v Speaker 2>favors,</v>

37
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.840
<v Speaker 2>like he won't help you find your lost wallet,</v>

38
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:44.950
<v Speaker 2>generally speaking,</v>

39
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:46.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

40
00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.190
<v Speaker 2>but that isn't,</v>

41
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.121
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

42
00:01:49.121 --> 00:01:51.700
<v Speaker 2>if you take a bit of a more sophisticated approach to it,</v>

43
00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.890
<v Speaker 2>you know what you're doing.</v>

44
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.030
<v Speaker 2>If you pray,</v>

45
00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:56.703
<v Speaker 2>we could even,</v>

46
00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.270
<v Speaker 2>we'll seem to find that more acceptable is that you,</v>

47
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.550
<v Speaker 2>you formulate a question and you,</v>

48
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.050
<v Speaker 2>you wait for an answer.</v>

49
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.030
<v Speaker 2>Like a prayer might be,</v>

50
00:02:07.031 --> 00:02:07.864
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

51
00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.290
<v Speaker 2>I would like to do the best thing I could with my life.</v>

52
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.480
<v Speaker 2>Now you have to open yourself up to that.</v>

53
00:02:13.481 --> 00:02:14.231
<v Speaker 2>That's to knock.</v>

54
00:02:14.231 --> 00:02:15.310
<v Speaker 2>So the door will open.</v>

55
00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.380
<v Speaker 2>I would like to do the best thing with my life.</v>

56
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.360
<v Speaker 2>What might that be?</v>

57
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.640
<v Speaker 2>Now you could say that you're thinking,</v>

58
00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:22.990
<v Speaker 2>when you say that are you are,</v>

59
00:02:22.991 --> 00:02:27.070
<v Speaker 2>you could say that you're leaving yourself open for a revelation or an</v>

60
00:02:27.071 --> 00:02:27.904
<v Speaker 2>intuition,</v>

61
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.240
<v Speaker 2>but you're communing with whatever it is that enables you to receive wisdom.</v>

62
00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.010
<v Speaker 2>And you can attribute all of that to you,</v>

63
00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.960
<v Speaker 2>or you can attribute it to your brain,</v>

64
00:02:37.961 --> 00:02:38.561
<v Speaker 2>I suppose,</v>

65
00:02:38.561 --> 00:02:39.440
<v Speaker 2>but you're,</v>

66
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.490
<v Speaker 2>you're really communing with the structure of the cosmos when you're,</v>

67
00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.260
<v Speaker 2>when you're asking such a question,</v>

68
00:02:44.261 --> 00:02:49.000
<v Speaker 2>and especially if you do it properly and it's really useful to do that and it's</v>

69
00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:51.910
<v Speaker 2>really necessary because it orients you properly.</v>

70
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.200
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

71
00:02:53.201 --> 00:02:57.190
<v Speaker 2>the demise of prayer when prayer is considered in a sophisticated manner,</v>

72
00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.600
<v Speaker 2>which is do I commune with the better part of myself,</v>

73
00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:02.434
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

74
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.720
<v Speaker 2>to determine how I should orient myself in the world?</v>

75
00:03:04.721 --> 00:03:06.820
<v Speaker 2>It's a catastrophic loss not to do that.</v>
