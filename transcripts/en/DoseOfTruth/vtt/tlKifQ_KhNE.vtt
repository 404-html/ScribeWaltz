1
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.190
<v Speaker 1>I began to understand that the goal of psychic development by which he means</v>

2
00:00:12.191 --> 00:00:14.200
<v Speaker 1>psychological development or spiritual development</v>

3
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:17.480
<v Speaker 1>is the self.</v>

4
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.860
<v Speaker 1>There is no linear evolution.</v>

5
00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:22.740
<v Speaker 1>There's only a circumambulation of itself a getting closer.</v>

6
00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:23.220
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

7
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.230
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're spiraling into something,</v>

8
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.060
<v Speaker 1>something like that and the thing that you're spiraling into recedes as you move</v>

9
00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:31.800
<v Speaker 1>towards it and it gets more and more</v>

10
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.030
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated and well developed as you move towards it because you're not going</v>

11
00:00:37.031 --> 00:00:38.080
<v Speaker 1>to run out of goals,</v>

12
00:00:38.081 --> 00:00:38.321
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

13
00:00:38.321 --> 00:00:40.420
<v Speaker 1>No matter how much you have your act together,</v>

14
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.930
<v Speaker 1>there's probably undoubtedly 30 dimensions along which you could get your act</v>

15
00:00:46.181 --> 00:00:48.030
<v Speaker 1>together a lot more so.</v>

16
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.480
<v Speaker 1>And some of those aren't even conceivable to you when you're in your initial on</v>

17
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.830
<v Speaker 1>carved state,</v>

18
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.730
<v Speaker 1>let's say uniform development exists at most at the beginning.</v>

19
00:00:57.731 --> 00:00:58.360
<v Speaker 1>Later,</v>

20
00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.980
<v Speaker 1>everything points towards the center.</v>

21
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.030
<v Speaker 1>This insight gave me stability and gradually my inner peace returned.</v>

22
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:09.530
<v Speaker 1>So this is fun.</v>

23
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.151
<v Speaker 1>On the left there,</v>

24
00:01:11.151 --> 00:01:12.530
<v Speaker 1>that's the sharp cathedral.</v>

25
00:01:12.531 --> 00:01:15.380
<v Speaker 1>That's the one that has the maze in it that I told you about.</v>

26
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.860
<v Speaker 1>They actually light that up with lasers now and so that's it lit up with lasers.</v>

27
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.913
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

28
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.520
<v Speaker 1>so it,</v>

29
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.700
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

30
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.770
<v Speaker 1>they're turning it into a cathedral of light,</v>

31
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.810
<v Speaker 1>which I think is really fascinating.</v>

32
00:01:26.811 --> 00:01:27.290
<v Speaker 1>And it's a,</v>

33
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.480
<v Speaker 1>it's a continuation of the same idea,</v>

34
00:01:29.481 --> 00:01:29.721
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

35
00:01:29.721 --> 00:01:33.590
<v Speaker 1>Because the stain glass windows where obviously I wouldn't call them primitive</v>

36
00:01:33.591 --> 00:01:34.460
<v Speaker 1>attempts to do that.</v>

37
00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:34.701
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

38
00:01:34.701 --> 00:01:36.650
<v Speaker 1>stained glass windows are pretty impressive.</v>

39
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.281
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

40
00:01:37.281 --> 00:01:37.730
<v Speaker 1>buddy,</v>

41
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.800
<v Speaker 1>it's an elaboration of the same thing.</v>

42
00:01:39.801 --> 00:01:41.420
<v Speaker 1>So now you can go to that Cathedral.</v>

43
00:01:41.421 --> 00:01:42.950
<v Speaker 1>They light up the whole town like that,</v>

44
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.540
<v Speaker 1>which is really something.</v>

45
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:45.141
<v Speaker 1>And so there,</v>

46
00:01:45.141 --> 00:01:46.820
<v Speaker 1>and there is how the cathedral is built.</v>

47
00:01:46.821 --> 00:01:47.654
<v Speaker 1>It's across.</v>

48
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.890
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

49
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.430
<v Speaker 1>and do you remember the cross is an ax that marks the center of the world and</v>

50
00:01:52.431 --> 00:01:54.710
<v Speaker 1>the cross is the place where each individual is.</v>

51
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.680
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's the fundamental message of Christianity is the Crossmark's</v>

52
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.640
<v Speaker 1>the place where every single individual is.</v>

53
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.910
<v Speaker 1>And it's a tragic place that consists of suffering and exposure to malevolence.</v>

54
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.030
<v Speaker 1>And that the only way to come to terms with it is to accept it.</v>

55
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.160
<v Speaker 1>And that seems to me,</v>

56
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't see anything metaphysical about that statement whatsoever.</v>

57
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.143
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

58
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.600
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

59
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.980
<v Speaker 1>x marks the spot.</v>

60
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.790
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough.</v>

61
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:20.930
<v Speaker 1>You're in a spot.</v>

62
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.700
<v Speaker 1>You're right in the center of your world.</v>

63
00:02:22.701 --> 00:02:25.190
<v Speaker 1>It's written the center of the world as far as you're concerned.</v>

64
00:02:25.191 --> 00:02:26.480
<v Speaker 1>And the same with the rest of us.</v>

65
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.080
<v Speaker 1>It's characterized by suffering and exposure to malevolence.</v>

66
00:02:30.081 --> 00:02:31.310
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about that.</v>

67
00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:32.870
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to do about that?</v>

68
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.943
<v Speaker 1>Bitter,</v>

69
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:34.820
<v Speaker 1>resentful,</v>

70
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:35.683
<v Speaker 1>hateful.</v>

71
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.250
<v Speaker 1>All that does is make it worse.</v>

72
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.270
<v Speaker 1>So you have to accept it.</v>

73
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.730
<v Speaker 1>Now that's not an easy thing because that's actually,</v>

74
00:02:41.731 --> 00:02:42.151
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

75
00:02:42.151 --> 00:02:46.170
<v Speaker 1>a heroic task to voluntarily accept the conditions of your own existence.</v>

76
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.420
<v Speaker 1>And that happens at the cross.</v>

77
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.433
<v Speaker 1>So that's fine.</v>

78
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.270
<v Speaker 1>And that's associated with light.</v>

79
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.820
<v Speaker 1>Well that's good that that's associated with light.</v>

80
00:02:53.821 --> 00:02:56.010
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't want that to be associated with darkness.</v>

81
00:02:56.011 --> 00:02:57.270
<v Speaker 1>That would be a bad thing.</v>

82
00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:58.613
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

83
00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.300
<v Speaker 1>and so there's the,</v>

84
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.741
<v Speaker 1>there's the,</v>

85
00:03:05.741 --> 00:03:06.574
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

86
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.940
<v Speaker 1>the labyrinth that was built in 1,280.</v>

87
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.080
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea is you walk in here,</v>

88
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.710
<v Speaker 1>it's the same idea as that star sequence of slides that I just showed you.</v>

89
00:03:19.811 --> 00:03:20.690
<v Speaker 1>So here's the idea,</v>

90
00:03:20.691 --> 00:03:22.090
<v Speaker 1>is that north,</v>

91
00:03:22.091 --> 00:03:22.924
<v Speaker 1>south,</v>

92
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.591
<v Speaker 1>west,</v>

93
00:03:23.591 --> 00:03:24.424
<v Speaker 1>and east.</v>

94
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.580
<v Speaker 1>So that's the whole world laid out in two dimensions.</v>

95
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.370
<v Speaker 1>And so the question is how do you get to the center?</v>

96
00:03:30.371 --> 00:03:31.690
<v Speaker 1>Now we already know what the center is.</v>

97
00:03:31.691 --> 00:03:33.460
<v Speaker 1>The center is the center of the cross.</v>

98
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.620
<v Speaker 1>That's the place of maximal suffering.</v>

99
00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:38.500
<v Speaker 1>You could say maximal malevolence as well,</v>

100
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.750
<v Speaker 1>but it's also the place where that's transcended.</v>

101
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.280
<v Speaker 1>So how do you get there?</v>

102
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.660
<v Speaker 1>While the answer is,</v>

103
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.841
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

104
00:03:43.841 --> 00:03:47.650
<v Speaker 1>you don't just stand on the outside looking in,</v>

105
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.270
<v Speaker 1>that's not going to help.</v>

106
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:50.051
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

107
00:03:50.051 --> 00:03:54.160
<v Speaker 1>and you can't just run right to the center even if you're in California.</v>

108
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:55.653
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

109
00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.850
<v Speaker 1>you have to walk in here and then you see you go like this and you go to every</v>

110
00:04:04.901 --> 00:04:05.980
<v Speaker 1>single place,</v>

111
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.290
<v Speaker 1>every single place on that,</v>

112
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.510
<v Speaker 1>on that little cosmos.</v>

113
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.470
<v Speaker 1>And then once you've gone to every single place and expanded yourself as a</v>

114
00:04:14.471 --> 00:04:17.620
<v Speaker 1>consequence of going north and west and east and south,</v>

115
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.110
<v Speaker 1>then there's enough of you so that you're at,</v>

116
00:04:20.111 --> 00:04:23.290
<v Speaker 1>so that you can tolerate being first of all that you could figure out where the</v>

117
00:04:23.291 --> 00:04:23.801
<v Speaker 1>center is,</v>

118
00:04:23.801 --> 00:04:26.350
<v Speaker 1>but also that you can tolerate being at the center.</v>

119
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.840
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what that represents.</v>

120
00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.013
<v Speaker 1>And that's pretty.</v>

121
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.611
<v Speaker 1>And look,</v>

122
00:04:30.611 --> 00:04:31.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

123
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.620
<v Speaker 1>let's make no mistake about it.</v>

124
00:04:32.621 --> 00:04:33.310
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

125
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.680
<v Speaker 1>people were pretty damn serious about those ideas.</v>

126
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:36.813
<v Speaker 1>Like that's uh,</v>

127
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.840
<v Speaker 1>that's quite the piece of work for people in the 12th century in all of those,</v>

128
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.750
<v Speaker 1>some of those damn cathedrals took 300 years to build.</v>

129
00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.180
<v Speaker 1>We don't build anything that takes 300 years.</v>

130
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.911
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

131
00:04:46.911 --> 00:04:50.590
<v Speaker 1>and people were putting a lot of effort into whatever these things meant,</v>

132
00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

133
00:04:51.821 --> 00:04:54.340
<v Speaker 1>and if you think they meant bearded man in the sky,</v>

134
00:04:54.341 --> 00:04:55.174
<v Speaker 1>then you know,</v>

135
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.280
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to,</v>

136
00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.320
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to account for the kind of motivation that would produce these</v>

137
00:05:02.321 --> 00:05:06.700
<v Speaker 1>buildings with that kind of paucity of conceptualization.</v>

138
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:07.241
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

139
00:05:07.241 --> 00:05:08.080
<v Speaker 1>the towns,</v>

140
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:13.410
<v Speaker 1>and it was certainly the case in charters that they groaned under the tax burden</v>

141
00:05:13.991 --> 00:05:15.700
<v Speaker 1>that was required to produce these.</v>

142
00:05:15.701 --> 00:05:16.481
<v Speaker 1>Now you might think,</v>

143
00:05:16.481 --> 00:05:20.020
<v Speaker 1>well that's partly tyrannical and no doubt that's the case,</v>

144
00:05:20.021 --> 00:05:20.710
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

145
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.980
<v Speaker 1>but that's not the whole story.</v>

146
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.890
<v Speaker 1>The whole story is that the people who produce those buildings,</v>

147
00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:32.010
<v Speaker 1>they thought about every bit of it is nothing's accidental and they're trying to</v>

148
00:05:32.741 --> 00:05:35.950
<v Speaker 1>portray something just like that window is trying to portray something.</v>

149
00:05:35.951 --> 00:05:37.480
<v Speaker 1>That's the same thing as this.</v>

150
00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.770
<v Speaker 1>It's the center from which all things manifest themselves.</v>

151
00:05:41.771 --> 00:05:42.550
<v Speaker 1>You see it,</v>

152
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:43.383
<v Speaker 1>that's Christ.</v>

153
00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.880
<v Speaker 1>They're being portrayed as,</v>

154
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.190
<v Speaker 1>as that center or the center within him,</v>

155
00:05:48.191 --> 00:05:48.851
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

156
00:05:48.851 --> 00:05:50.110
<v Speaker 1>Very much like the shocker is,</v>

157
00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.010
<v Speaker 1>and in,</v>

158
00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.853
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

159
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.890
<v Speaker 1>in a yoga practice,</v>

160
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:55.630
<v Speaker 1>same basic idea.</v>

161
00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.480
<v Speaker 1>It's the opening up of the internal structure and,</v>

162
00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.310
<v Speaker 1>and its proper realization.</v>

163
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.073
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

164
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.250
<v Speaker 1>there are people walking the</v>

165
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:10.190
<v Speaker 1>labyrinth.</v>

166
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:13.970
<v Speaker 1>So that's the coat of many colors,</v>

167
00:06:13.971 --> 00:06:14.211
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

168
00:06:14.211 --> 00:06:14.530
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

169
00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:19.530
<v Speaker 1>that's this differentiated motive being that enables you to be competent at,</v>

170
00:06:20.131 --> 00:06:23.990
<v Speaker 1>at home in the widest possible number of places.</v>

171
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.350
<v Speaker 1>And that that's a real differentiation of your personality.</v>

172
00:06:27.351 --> 00:06:30.830
<v Speaker 1>It's breaking through the boundaries of your personality,</v>

173
00:06:30.831 --> 00:06:34.550
<v Speaker 1>including the ones that you impose on yourself to become</v>

174
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:38.510
<v Speaker 1>someone who is useful wherever they're put.</v>
