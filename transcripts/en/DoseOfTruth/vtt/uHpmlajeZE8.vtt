00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.490
<v Speaker 1>I am a web software developer.</v>

2
00:00:08.491 --> 00:00:09.350
<v Speaker 1>Are you hiring your,</v>

3
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.590
<v Speaker 1>can I volunteer for anything?</v>

4
00:00:10.591 --> 00:00:11.610
<v Speaker 1>I could build anything.</v>

5
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:12.810
<v Speaker 1>I can automate things.</v>

6
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.940
<v Speaker 1>I could simply be an assistant of sorts.</v>

7
00:00:14.941 --> 00:00:16.050
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for your time.</v>

8
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:16.801
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

9
00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:18.870
<v Speaker 1>what I would like to say about that is first,</v>

10
00:00:18.871 --> 00:00:19.820
<v Speaker 1>thank you Adam.</v>

11
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.890
<v Speaker 1>It's much appreciated and a lot of people have volunteered their time to me and</v>

12
00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:26.630
<v Speaker 1>their and their,</v>

13
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:27.480
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

14
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.100
<v Speaker 1>technological expertise.</v>

15
00:00:29.101 --> 00:00:31.860
<v Speaker 1>And as much as I'd like to make use of it,</v>

16
00:00:31.861 --> 00:00:36.861
<v Speaker 1>that simple truth of the matter is that I'm sufficiently overwhelmed by the</v>

17
00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:38.700
<v Speaker 1>complexity of my life at the moment,</v>

18
00:00:38.701 --> 00:00:42.360
<v Speaker 1>that it's very difficult to undertake a new collaborative project with anyone.</v>

19
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

20
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.460
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking,</v>

21
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.560
<v Speaker 1>before all this political,</v>

22
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.953
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

23
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.150
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it before all these political events overtook my life.</v>

24
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.780
<v Speaker 1>I was already scheduled probably about six months to a year out.</v>

25
00:00:57.781 --> 00:00:58.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

26
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.000
<v Speaker 1>all my time was already eaten up.</v>

27
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.230
<v Speaker 1>And of course the addition of everything that's happened in the last year or two</v>

28
00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:08.640
<v Speaker 1>that has occupied my time to a degree that is was,</v>

29
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.370
<v Speaker 1>is really somewhat unimaginable.</v>

30
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.320
<v Speaker 1>And so I just can't take on additional help,</v>

31
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.340
<v Speaker 1>which is so strange because you'd think that help is help and that it would save</v>

32
00:01:20.341 --> 00:01:20.611
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

33
00:01:20.611 --> 00:01:20.971
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

34
00:01:20.971 --> 00:01:25.170
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to enter into a collaborative relationship with someone and</v>

35
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.080
<v Speaker 1>especially if you want to give them credit and do things properly.</v>

36
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.273
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

37
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:30.780
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

38
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.640
<v Speaker 1>at the moment I'm afraid that I can't entertain any such offers even though I'd</v>

39
00:01:35.641 --> 00:01:36.091
<v Speaker 1>like to,</v>

40
00:01:36.091 --> 00:01:37.680
<v Speaker 1>and there may come a time in the future,</v>

41
00:01:37.681 --> 00:01:41.910
<v Speaker 1>especially when I'm hopefully starting to work more on this online university</v>

42
00:01:41.911 --> 00:01:42.744
<v Speaker 1>project.</v>

43
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

44
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.340
<v Speaker 1>I've got a few projects to finish up before that to the new personality task,</v>

45
00:01:47.341 --> 00:01:49.380
<v Speaker 1>which we've just about got all the bugs worked out of.</v>

46
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.240
<v Speaker 1>And also the high school version of the future authoring program are all,</v>

47
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.520
<v Speaker 1>we're all set up long before any of this happened,</v>

48
00:01:56.521 --> 00:02:00.330
<v Speaker 1>so I have to clear them out before I can concentrate on a new project that I</v>

49
00:02:00.331 --> 00:02:05.331
<v Speaker 1>finished a book over the last couple of years to called a 12 rules for life,</v>

50
00:02:05.431 --> 00:02:07.050
<v Speaker 1>an antidote to chaos,</v>

51
00:02:07.051 --> 00:02:08.730
<v Speaker 1>which is now available by the way,</v>

52
00:02:08.731 --> 00:02:11.640
<v Speaker 1>if you're interested on Amazon for preorder.</v>

53
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.833
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

54
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.910
<v Speaker 1>and so anyways,</v>

55
00:02:14.911 --> 00:02:17.820
<v Speaker 1>this is my roundabout way of saying thank you very much,</v>

56
00:02:17.821 --> 00:02:22.821
<v Speaker 1>but I can't accept more help at the moment because my time is too restricted to</v>

57
00:02:23.911 --> 00:02:25.020
<v Speaker 1>make proper use of it.</v>

58
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.350
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
