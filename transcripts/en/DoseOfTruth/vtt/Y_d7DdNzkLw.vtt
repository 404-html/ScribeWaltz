00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.340
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any guidance around taking notes from books and lectures?</v>

2
00:00:05.341 --> 00:00:05.581
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3
00:00:05.581 --> 00:00:05.791
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4
00:00:05.791 --> 00:00:06.624
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>

5
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.560
<v Speaker 1>Like don't be taking notes during the lecture.</v>

6
00:00:10.561 --> 00:00:13.830
<v Speaker 1>Exactly because then you're not listening to the lecture.</v>

7
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.520
<v Speaker 1>It's like listened to the lecture and then take notes afterwards.</v>

8
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.300
<v Speaker 1>Now that doesn't work for every discipline but.</v>

9
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.850
<v Speaker 1>But it certainly works for disciplines like students in my lectures.</v>

10
00:00:23.851 --> 00:00:24.511
<v Speaker 1>I always tell them,</v>

11
00:00:24.511 --> 00:00:27.300
<v Speaker 1>don't take notes during the lecture,</v>

12
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.950
<v Speaker 1>listen to the damn lecture.</v>

13
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.970
<v Speaker 1>You can take notes afterwards because what that does is force you to practice</v>

14
00:00:32.971 --> 00:00:36.330
<v Speaker 1>remembering and then with regards to books,</v>

15
00:00:36.331 --> 00:00:37.410
<v Speaker 1>it's like read,</v>

16
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.020
<v Speaker 1>don't highlight,</v>

17
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.820
<v Speaker 1>don't underline like that.</v>

18
00:00:41.821 --> 00:00:43.290
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's just rubbish.</v>

19
00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:44.520
<v Speaker 1>I think it's pseudo work.</v>

20
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.270
<v Speaker 1>Read a couple of paragraphs or maybe an essay or something like that.</v>

21
00:00:48.271 --> 00:00:49.950
<v Speaker 1>Depending on the density of the book.</v>

22
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.060
<v Speaker 1>Close the book,</v>

23
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.953
<v Speaker 1>think about it,</v>

24
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.760
<v Speaker 1>write down what you're thinking,</v>

25
00:00:53.761 --> 00:00:55.410
<v Speaker 1>write down what you remember but,</v>

26
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.190
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

27
00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.110
<v Speaker 1>but in the context of what you're thinking about because that instantiates it</v>

28
00:01:01.111 --> 00:01:03.510
<v Speaker 1>into your memory and give and puts it at hand.</v>

29
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.860
<v Speaker 1>Like people ask me,</v>

30
00:01:04.861 --> 00:01:05.521
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

31
00:01:05.521 --> 00:01:09.060
<v Speaker 1>how it is that I can remember all the things that I talk about extemporaneously</v>

32
00:01:09.061 --> 00:01:13.620
<v Speaker 1>when I'm lecturing and the reason for that is because I've thought them through,</v>

33
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:01:14.551 --> 00:01:15.600
<v Speaker 1>I read them and I think,</v>

35
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.841
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

36
00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:16.201
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

37
00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:17.910
<v Speaker 1>well that's an interesting idea.</v>

38
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.570
<v Speaker 1>How does it relate to all these other ideas that I know,</v>

39
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.350
<v Speaker 1>like what is it significance for this idea and what's its significance for this</v>

40
00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:28.020
<v Speaker 1>idea and do I believe it and how might I criticize it?</v>

41
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.490
<v Speaker 1>So it's Kinda like I'm,</v>

42
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm attaching little memory hooks to it in in five different ways and then I've</v>

43
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.651
<v Speaker 1>got it.</v>

44
00:01:34.651 --> 00:01:34.951
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

45
00:01:34.951 --> 00:01:39.600
<v Speaker 1>it's part of me and that seems to be part of recall rather than.</v>

46
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.900
<v Speaker 1>So rather than recognition and recall is the Spontaneous Act of remembering</v>

47
00:01:46.141 --> 00:01:48.750
<v Speaker 1>something complex and when you recall something,</v>

48
00:01:48.751 --> 00:01:52.560
<v Speaker 1>you're actually practicing remembering it and that's what you need to do if you</v>

49
00:01:52.561 --> 00:01:53.760
<v Speaker 1>want that to be part of you.</v>

50
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.210
<v Speaker 1>So I would say separate out the function of reading and note taking.</v>

51
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:00.630
<v Speaker 1>So read,</v>

52
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.673
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

53
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.050
<v Speaker 1>write or read.</v>

54
00:02:04.051 --> 00:02:04.441
<v Speaker 1>Write.</v>

55
00:02:04.441 --> 00:02:05.300
<v Speaker 1>Think though,</v>

56
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.200
<v Speaker 1>because the last two things are quite similar,</v>

57
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.610
<v Speaker 1>but don't read the book and then read a sentence and then write down that</v>

58
00:02:11.611 --> 00:02:12.151
<v Speaker 1>sentence.</v>

59
00:02:12.151 --> 00:02:13.170
<v Speaker 1>That's not helpful.</v>

60
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.210
<v Speaker 1>You could read the sentence,</v>

61
00:02:15.211 --> 00:02:16.021
<v Speaker 1>close the book,</v>

62
00:02:16.021 --> 00:02:18.960
<v Speaker 1>and then reformulate the sentence so that now it's your sentence,</v>

63
00:02:18.961 --> 00:02:19.201
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

64
00:02:19.201 --> 00:02:20.100
<v Speaker 1>Then you'll remember it.</v>

65
00:02:20.101 --> 00:02:21.090
<v Speaker 1>Then you'll understand it.</v>

66
00:02:21.091 --> 00:02:22.110
<v Speaker 1>That works really well.</v>
