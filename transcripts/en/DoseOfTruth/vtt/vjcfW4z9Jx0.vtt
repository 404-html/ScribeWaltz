<v Speaker 1>Dr. Peterson,</v>

2
00:00:08.331 --> 00:00:10.760
<v Speaker 1>I have an interview for medicine coming up very soon.</v>

3
00:00:10.761 --> 00:00:14.840
<v Speaker 1>It's structured in the MMI format and it's intensely competitive.</v>

4
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.420
<v Speaker 1>Any tips on how to stand out from the rest?</v>

5
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:20.653
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

6
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.430
<v Speaker 1>well the only thing I could say is that</v>

7
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.011
<v Speaker 1>two things.</v>

8
00:00:26.011 --> 00:00:29.370
<v Speaker 1>One is really pay attention to the interviewers,</v>

9
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.671
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

10
00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:30.780
<v Speaker 1>Super attention.</v>

11
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.890
<v Speaker 1>Like don't glare at them.</v>

12
00:00:31.891 --> 00:00:33.840
<v Speaker 1>Like you're aggressively paranoid,</v>

13
00:00:33.841 --> 00:00:36.900
<v Speaker 1>but like make sure you're focused on them.</v>

14
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.520
<v Speaker 1>And then the other thing I would say is say what you really think,</v>

15
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:42.840
<v Speaker 1>like tell the truth.</v>

16
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:43.703
<v Speaker 1>It'll make you,</v>

17
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.211
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

18
00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:46.800
<v Speaker 1>if you tell the truth and it doesn't work,</v>

19
00:00:46.801 --> 00:00:47.634
<v Speaker 1>then you know,</v>

20
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.640
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's not the school for you.</v>

21
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.170
<v Speaker 1>That's something to really think about.</v>

22
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:53.610
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

23
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.500
<v Speaker 1>and if it doesn't work anywhere and you tell the truth,</v>

24
00:00:55.501 --> 00:00:56.760
<v Speaker 1>maybe medicine isn't for you.</v>

25
00:00:56.761 --> 00:00:58.530
<v Speaker 1>And I know that might be a terrible shock,</v>

26
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.950
<v Speaker 1>but let's assume that you are genuinely properly motivated to study medicine.</v>

27
00:01:04.321 --> 00:01:06.930
<v Speaker 1>Then tell them what you think.</v>

28
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.960
<v Speaker 1>You know so many people when they go into an interview try and they do this when</v>

29
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:15.750
<v Speaker 1>they write essays too is try to tell the interviewers what you think they want</v>

30
00:01:15.751 --> 00:01:16.081
<v Speaker 1>to hear it,</v>

31
00:01:16.081 --> 00:01:19.260
<v Speaker 1>but you can bloody well be sure that virtually everybody who's being interviewed</v>

32
00:01:19.261 --> 00:01:24.261
<v Speaker 1>is going to do that and I don't think that's very advisable because if you don't</v>

33
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.450
<v Speaker 1>manifest yourself the way you are,</v>

34
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.480
<v Speaker 1>then there's no way that the path that's proper for you can reveal itself.</v>

35
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.110
<v Speaker 1>I know that sounds sort of mystical,</v>

36
00:01:34.111 --> 00:01:35.670
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know how to put it any better.</v>

37
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.660
<v Speaker 1>The best way to stand out in an interview always assuming you're competent and</v>

38
00:01:41.881 --> 00:01:43.050
<v Speaker 1>that you've done the preparation,</v>

39
00:01:43.051 --> 00:01:48.051
<v Speaker 1>you know and that you're not living a lie is to actually say what you think and</v>

40
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.250
<v Speaker 1>hopefully what will happen is that there'll be other people on the panel that's,</v>

41
00:01:53.251 --> 00:01:53.720
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

42
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.720
<v Speaker 1>that are looking at you who are of the same type and that would characterize a</v>

43
00:01:59.101 --> 00:02:00.210
<v Speaker 1>good position for you.</v>

44
00:02:00.211 --> 00:02:01.021
<v Speaker 1>A good place to be.</v>

45
00:02:01.021 --> 00:02:04.800
<v Speaker 1>If there are people like that and they'll know what you're doing and that will</v>

46
00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.640
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

47
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.530
<v Speaker 1>then they'll think you know that person,</v>

48
00:02:07.531 --> 00:02:09.210
<v Speaker 1>you know they're there,</v>

49
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.930
<v Speaker 1>they'd be good.</v>

50
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:10.910
<v Speaker 1>They're straightforward,</v>

51
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:11.611
<v Speaker 1>they're honest,</v>

52
00:02:11.611 --> 00:02:12.210
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

53
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.043
<v Speaker 1>they're tough.</v>

54
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.800
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

55
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.120
<v Speaker 1>they can say what they think.</v>

56
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.580
<v Speaker 1>And if there aren't people like that on the panel,</v>

57
00:02:17.581 --> 00:02:18.151
<v Speaker 1>then I would say,</v>

58
00:02:18.151 --> 00:02:19.860
<v Speaker 1>you probably don't want to go there anyways.</v>

59
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.630
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I would,</v>

60
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.980
<v Speaker 1>that's what I would do.</v>

61
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.200
<v Speaker 1>Be True to yourself,</v>

62
00:02:25.201 --> 00:02:25.590
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

63
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.670
<v Speaker 1>But that also assumes that you've done your homework and that you're prepared</v>

64
00:02:29.671 --> 00:02:33.300
<v Speaker 1>and all of that because if you're a useless jackass and you're yourself,</v>

65
00:02:33.301 --> 00:02:35.070
<v Speaker 1>while obviously that is going to work.</v>

66
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.780
<v Speaker 1>So good luck.</v>

67
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.790
<v Speaker 1>Good luck with your interview.</v>

68
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.740
<v Speaker 1>But I always think that like you,</v>

69
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.910
<v Speaker 1>the other thing too is don't treat the interviewers as enemies.</v>

70
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.141
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

71
00:02:46.141 --> 00:02:47.310
<v Speaker 1>if that's hard,</v>

72
00:02:47.311 --> 00:02:51.150
<v Speaker 1>because if you're kind of petrified about the potential outcome and you feel</v>

73
00:02:51.151 --> 00:02:52.830
<v Speaker 1>intense judgment,</v>

74
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.300
<v Speaker 1>then you're likely to go in.</v>

75
00:02:54.301 --> 00:02:56.250
<v Speaker 1>They're kind of afraid and nervous and,</v>

76
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.090
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

77
00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.860
<v Speaker 1>and maybe even resentful.</v>

78
00:02:58.861 --> 00:02:59.694
<v Speaker 1>It's like</v>

79
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.690
<v Speaker 1>you've already done enough so that you're going to get interviewed.</v>

80
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.810
<v Speaker 1>So in some sense the interviewers are hoping that you'll be great already.</v>

81
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.811
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

82
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:14.320
<v Speaker 1>there might be the odd cynic in there who's trying to figure out a reason to</v>

83
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:16.600
<v Speaker 1>give you an x and check you off the list.</v>

84
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.270
<v Speaker 1>But most of the people sitting there,</v>

85
00:03:19.271 --> 00:03:19.991
<v Speaker 1>if they have a clue,</v>

86
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:23.920
<v Speaker 1>are going to be looking for good candidates and they're going to assume that</v>

87
00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:24.580
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

88
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.720
<v Speaker 1>you've hit threshold.</v>

89
00:03:25.721 --> 00:03:28.300
<v Speaker 1>And so it's not like they're not on your side.</v>

90
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.250
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a good thing to keep in mind too.</v>

91
00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:31.390
<v Speaker 1>You're not going in there to,</v>

92
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.670
<v Speaker 1>to face a panel of enemies,</v>

93
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.230
<v Speaker 1>you're going in there to face a panel of the sort of people that you're likely</v>

94
00:03:38.231 --> 00:03:39.460
<v Speaker 1>to be in 10 years.</v>

95
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.850
<v Speaker 1>So that's another thing that's really useful to keep in mind with interviews in</v>

96
00:03:42.851 --> 00:03:43.271
<v Speaker 1>general.</v>

97
00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:43.870
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>
