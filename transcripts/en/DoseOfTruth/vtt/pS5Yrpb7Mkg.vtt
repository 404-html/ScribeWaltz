00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:08.840
<v Speaker 1>Professor Peterson,</v>

2
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.230
<v Speaker 1>just a two second.</v>

3
00:00:10.231 --> 00:00:12.600
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much for my community and the Jewish community.</v>

4
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.800
<v Speaker 1>So many people have been inspired by you to be better people and I wouldn't be</v>

5
00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:17.820
<v Speaker 1>able to speak to you that saying that.</v>

6
00:00:17.821 --> 00:00:18.720
<v Speaker 1>So thank you very much.</v>

7
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:20.163
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

8
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.493
<v Speaker 1>a couple of things.</v>

9
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.120
<v Speaker 1>The first thing I wanted to do is make a quick comment that you might find</v>

10
00:00:24.121 --> 00:00:26.520
<v Speaker 1>interesting that in the Jewish astrological calendar,</v>

11
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:27.330
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

12
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.960
<v Speaker 1>we read the release cycle of the five books of Moses and it just so happens that</v>

13
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.790
<v Speaker 1>we are reading this part of the,</v>

14
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.870
<v Speaker 1>of the tourist story.</v>

15
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.131
<v Speaker 1>Very interesting.</v>

16
00:00:35.131 --> 00:00:35.940
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

17
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.020
<v Speaker 1>And a synchronistic,</v>

18
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.320
<v Speaker 1>which brings me into a question that I wanted to ask you about,</v>

19
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.500
<v Speaker 1>which is one question with two parts about your knowledge of,</v>

20
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.840
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

21
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.673
<v Speaker 1>of Hebrew.</v>

22
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

23
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.240
<v Speaker 1>because if you look at the Torah scrolls that you find in the synagogue,</v>

24
00:00:48.241 --> 00:00:49.350
<v Speaker 1>there are no vowels,</v>

25
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.220
<v Speaker 1>there are no sentences there.</v>

26
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.721
<v Speaker 1>It is a,</v>

27
00:00:51.721 --> 00:00:53.430
<v Speaker 1>it is chaos,</v>

28
00:00:53.431 --> 00:00:55.620
<v Speaker 1>chaos and order is trying to be bought into it.</v>

29
00:00:55.621 --> 00:00:58.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm wondering how knowledge knowledgeable are you of the Hebrew,</v>

30
00:00:58.681 --> 00:01:00.200
<v Speaker 1>which has many layers of,</v>

31
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.570
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

32
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.030
<v Speaker 1>of dimension staggering the ignorant of it.</v>

33
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.940
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

34
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.170
<v Speaker 1>I read a lot of commentaries,</v>

35
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.501
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

36
00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:09.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to zero in on the,</v>

37
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.050
<v Speaker 1>like with each of the phrases that we went through today,</v>

38
00:01:13.051 --> 00:01:15.300
<v Speaker 1>I probably looked at 10 different commentaries.</v>

39
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:16.523
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

40
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.090
<v Speaker 1>and then I have this underlying psychoanalytic knowledge that it's sort of like</v>

41
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.820
<v Speaker 1>if you have a bunch of different templates to look at things through and then</v>

42
00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:30.910
<v Speaker 1>something shines through all those templates at the same time,</v>

43
00:01:30.911 --> 00:01:32.110
<v Speaker 1>that's very unlikely.</v>

44
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.310
<v Speaker 1>And so then you can,</v>

45
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.363
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

46
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.680
<v Speaker 1>a coincidence is one thing,</v>

47
00:01:37.681 --> 00:01:40.410
<v Speaker 1>but five coincidence is that's no longer a coincidence.</v>

48
00:01:40.411 --> 00:01:41.400
<v Speaker 1>That's something else.</v>

49
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.660
<v Speaker 1>And so I think,</v>

50
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping that despite the fact that there's many,</v>

51
00:01:45.151 --> 00:01:49.620
<v Speaker 1>many things that I don't know that there's enough things that I do know to kind</v>

52
00:01:49.621 --> 00:01:53.100
<v Speaker 1>of weave my way through this with some degree of utility,</v>

53
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.180
<v Speaker 1>if not certainty.</v>

54
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.241
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

55
00:01:55.241 --> 00:01:56.074
<v Speaker 1>Cause I just,</v>

56
00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.921
<v Speaker 1>which is the second part,</v>

57
00:01:56.921 --> 00:01:58.090
<v Speaker 1>which I guess maybe you don't know,</v>

58
00:01:58.091 --> 00:01:58.481
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

59
00:01:58.481 --> 00:01:59.314
<v Speaker 1>the Midrash,</v>

60
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.950
<v Speaker 1>the Jewish oral stories that date back almost as long as these stories,</v>

61
00:02:02.951 --> 00:02:05.290
<v Speaker 1>which filling a lot of mindblowingly crazy,</v>

62
00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:06.124
<v Speaker 1>random,</v>

63
00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.140
<v Speaker 1>so many details about these stories.</v>

64
00:02:08.141 --> 00:02:10.710
<v Speaker 1>And I was just wondering if you had encountered any of them before I've</v>

65
00:02:10.711 --> 00:02:11.760
<v Speaker 1>encountered some of them,</v>

66
00:02:11.761 --> 00:02:12.301
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>

67
00:02:12.301 --> 00:02:12.870
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

68
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.980
<v Speaker 1>it's well,</v>

69
00:02:13.981 --> 00:02:14.551
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>

70
00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:15.061
<v Speaker 1>it's a very,</v>

71
00:02:15.061 --> 00:02:16.470
<v Speaker 1>very rich tradition.</v>

72
00:02:16.471 --> 00:02:20.040
<v Speaker 1>And so I haven't encountered enough of it.</v>

73
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.420
<v Speaker 1>Were you thinking of anything in specific specifically in relationship to this</v>

74
00:02:24.421 --> 00:02:25.190
<v Speaker 1>story?</v>

75
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.120
<v Speaker 1>Not In particular.</v>

76
00:02:26.121 --> 00:02:27.020
<v Speaker 1>I actually forgot it.</v>

77
00:02:27.021 --> 00:02:27.320
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

78
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.820
<v Speaker 1>I was intending to bring you a,</v>

79
00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.850
<v Speaker 1>a book of midrashic stolen.</v>

80
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.600
<v Speaker 1>That's a hell of a thing to say now.</v>

81
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:35.151
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

82
00:02:35.151 --> 00:02:35.600
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

83
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.040
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>

84
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.300
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

85
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.850
<v Speaker 1>I felt like I had to say that.</v>

86
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:38.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

87
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.961
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

88
00:02:38.961 --> 00:02:40.600
<v Speaker 1>maybe for the exodus version,</v>

89
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:41.443
<v Speaker 1>I'll bring you the bird.</v>

90
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.861
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

91
00:02:41.861 --> 00:02:42.694
<v Speaker 1>That would be good.</v>

92
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:43.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

93
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.590
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
