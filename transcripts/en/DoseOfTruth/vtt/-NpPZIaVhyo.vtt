1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.810
<v Speaker 1>Country Right now with all of you are on the front end of it because the rest of</v>

2
00:00:03.811 --> 00:00:07.260
<v Speaker 1>the world is trying to catch up right now and the fact that you guys are here,</v>

3
00:00:07.261 --> 00:00:09.780
<v Speaker 1>it shows that you saw at first and uh,</v>

4
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.240
<v Speaker 1>you were in for a treat for the next hour and a half,</v>

5
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.690
<v Speaker 1>so everybody give it up for Dr. Jordan.</v>

6
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.270
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

7
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.460
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

8
00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:05.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to walk through.</v>

9
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try to get through all the rules.</v>

10
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.883
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I've met him</v>

11
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.000
<v Speaker 2>once in London,</v>

12
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.130
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to give you the background because there's two other things going</v>

13
00:01:19.251 --> 00:01:24.251
<v Speaker 2>on in my life right now that I'm trying to sort out and I want to tie them</v>

14
00:01:25.311 --> 00:01:26.940
<v Speaker 2>together and use this,</v>

15
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.810
<v Speaker 2>this chance to talk with you further.</v>

16
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.510
<v Speaker 2>Thinking on,</v>

17
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.510
<v Speaker 2>on all of these fronts simultaneously I got invited a week and a half to do</v>

18
00:01:36.921 --> 00:01:40.460
<v Speaker 2>something that was really an overwhelming honor to me.</v>

19
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:41.763
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

20
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.780
<v Speaker 2>the pain with penguin books and in the UK is putting on the 50th anniversary</v>

21
00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:49.040
<v Speaker 2>version of that.</v>

22
00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.780
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

23
00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.500
<v Speaker 2>I think it's hard to say.</v>

24
00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.430
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

25
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.921
<v Speaker 2>You can say.</v>

26
00:02:11.921 --> 00:02:12.754
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

27
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.440
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the most important in the 20th century and maybe it's not,</v>

28
00:02:17.441 --> 00:02:22.441
<v Speaker 2>but it's in the top 10 and we have an overwhelming impact on me and I want to</v>

29
00:02:23.621 --> 00:02:28.621
<v Speaker 2>use the opportunity to write that introduction to do something that needs to be</v>

30
00:02:30.551 --> 00:02:31.384
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

31
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.770
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

32
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.770
<v Speaker 2>I was just in a debate on Saturday in Toronto called the debates and</v>

33
00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.600
<v Speaker 2>debate.</v>

34
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.600
<v Speaker 2>Opponents to contend with was the idea that just as the,</v>

35
00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.250
<v Speaker 2>as the radical right can go too far,</v>

36
00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.050
<v Speaker 2>that's a claim of both,</v>

37
00:03:02.051 --> 00:03:07.051
<v Speaker 2>which is virtually no disagreement except of course from the radical right.</v>

38
00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.410
<v Speaker 2>A left and go far and historical evidence for that is called overwhelming is to</v>

39
00:03:14.471 --> 00:03:15.820
<v Speaker 2>say almost nothing.</v>

40
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.950
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things I challenged my opponents to do was to say,</v>

41
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.381
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

42
00:03:20.381 --> 00:03:22.870
<v Speaker 2>how do you know when the radical left goes too far?</v>

43
00:03:22.871 --> 00:03:24.360
<v Speaker 2>Because they can go too far.</v>

44
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:25.643
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

45
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.210
<v Speaker 2>one debate,</v>

46
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:28.340
<v Speaker 2>Michael Dyson,</v>

47
00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.800
<v Speaker 2>he didn't answer the question at all.</v>

48
00:03:29.801 --> 00:03:31.630
<v Speaker 2>There's not that he was compelled to or anything.</v>

49
00:03:31.631 --> 00:03:32.500
<v Speaker 2>It was up to him.</v>

50
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.660
<v Speaker 2>And the other one said,</v>

51
00:03:34.661 --> 00:03:35.110
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

52
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.321
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

53
00:03:35.321 --> 00:03:36.520
<v Speaker 2>when they become violent,</v>

54
00:03:36.521 --> 00:03:40.720
<v Speaker 2>which to me is no answer golf because to say that people have gone too far when</v>

55
00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:41.770
<v Speaker 2>they've gone too far,</v>

56
00:03:41.771 --> 00:03:42.604
<v Speaker 2>isn't helpful</v>

57
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.510
<v Speaker 2>for all of us civilized people assuming that that's what we are are against</v>

58
00:03:49.511 --> 00:03:50.020
<v Speaker 2>violence.</v>

59
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.360
<v Speaker 2>So it's not a very deep,</v>

60
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:52.990
<v Speaker 2>it's not a very deep analysis.</v>

61
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.580
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is that trying to figure out putting the radical left is going</v>

62
00:03:57.581 --> 00:03:59.020
<v Speaker 2>to far is actually extraordinary,</v>

63
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.380
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily difficult because there isn't something that appears to be a</v>

64
00:04:02.381 --> 00:04:03.550
<v Speaker 2>smoking pistol.</v>

65
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:04.091
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

66
00:04:04.091 --> 00:04:08.770
<v Speaker 2>when the radical right starts speaking claims of racial ethnic superiority and</v>

67
00:04:08.771 --> 00:04:10.630
<v Speaker 2>then starts to react those up in the world.</v>

68
00:04:10.631 --> 00:04:10.961
<v Speaker 2>You think,</v>

69
00:04:10.961 --> 00:04:11.231
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

70
00:04:11.231 --> 00:04:13.440
<v Speaker 2>well you guys are out with the game like that.</v>

71
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.710
<v Speaker 2>That's not acceptable.</v>

72
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:19.740
<v Speaker 2>You want in the domain of civilized dialogue anymore on the lab.</v>

73
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.680
<v Speaker 2>It's not so obvious when things go off the rails.</v>

74
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.550
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

75
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.470
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things that really like reading about reading the Gulag</v>

76
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.373
<v Speaker 2>archipelago,</v>

77
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.530
<v Speaker 2>I liked reading it because it's not going to do like to read.</v>

78
00:04:32.531 --> 00:04:33.191
<v Speaker 2>It's slick.</v>

79
00:04:33.191 --> 00:04:36.280
<v Speaker 2>The 1700 page scream of anguish,</v>

80
00:04:36.281 --> 00:04:36.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

81
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:37.960
<v Speaker 2>it's tense,</v>

82
00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:39.163
<v Speaker 2>tense.</v>

83
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.580
<v Speaker 2>But what Social India and I don't,</v>

84
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:47.670
<v Speaker 2>I think it was something that no one had really done before him was to lay out</v>

85
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.220
<v Speaker 2>the evidence that the absolute brutality of the Soviet Union was not an</v>

86
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.590
<v Speaker 2>aberration in relationship to Marxist thinking,</v>

87
00:04:56.591 --> 00:05:00.040
<v Speaker 2>but a necessary consequence of Marxist thinking.</v>

88
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.580
<v Speaker 2>But the problem of course is that the argument spans something like 1700 pages</v>

89
00:05:06.341 --> 00:05:11.020
<v Speaker 2>and that's not concise and I'm not criticizing you because of that,</v>

90
00:05:11.021 --> 00:05:11.854
<v Speaker 2>because</v>

91
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.000
<v Speaker 2>because everything in that book needs to be in there as far as I can tell to in</v>

92
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.120
<v Speaker 2>the world to survive because there's things you have to eat and just sit there.</v>

93
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:23.003
<v Speaker 2>You die</v>

94
00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.013
<v Speaker 2>in the world,</v>

95
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.300
<v Speaker 2>and even if you don't die,</v>

96
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.070
<v Speaker 2>we can just sit there and you're going to suffer.</v>

97
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.160
<v Speaker 2>And so the antidote to suffering in the world,</v>

98
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.590
<v Speaker 2>exactly what you're trying to do.</v>

99
00:05:35.591 --> 00:05:36.470
<v Speaker 2>When you act in the world,</v>

100
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.700
<v Speaker 2>you're a preacher,</v>

101
00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.850
<v Speaker 2>you're a 50 year particular physiology reflects that extraordinary.</v>

102
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.440
<v Speaker 2>What you're trying to do in the world is to,</v>

103
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.500
<v Speaker 2>is to make things better than they are.</v>

104
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:48.470
<v Speaker 2>When you're hungry,</v>

105
00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:49.440
<v Speaker 2>to try to feed yourself,</v>

106
00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:51.780
<v Speaker 2>find some uranium.</v>

107
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.890
<v Speaker 2>You're taking care of your family so they don't suffer.</v>

108
00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:54.450
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

109
00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.900
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

110
00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.690
<v Speaker 2>you're orienting yourself towards something about and so the first proposition</v>

111
00:05:59.691 --> 00:06:02.090
<v Speaker 2>is you limited world.</v>

112
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:03.710
<v Speaker 2>Your frame of reference is valiantly.</v>

113
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.970
<v Speaker 2>Essentially what you're doing is moving always from a place that isn't as good</v>

114
00:06:07.971 --> 00:06:11.990
<v Speaker 2>as it could be to a place that someone edit and you see the world through that</v>

115
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.740
<v Speaker 2>Lens.</v>

116
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.140
<v Speaker 2>You're at point a and you're going to point B and point B is better than point a</v>

117
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.190
<v Speaker 2>and so because if it wasn't for why would you bother with it?</v>

118
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.040
<v Speaker 2>Why would you put in the time and effort if what you're moving towards is better</v>

119
00:06:22.041 --> 00:06:23.090
<v Speaker 2>than what you have?</v>

120
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.430
<v Speaker 2>It's a matter of definition.</v>

121
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.320
<v Speaker 2>Even that if you're acting for words a damn,</v>

122
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.870
<v Speaker 2>unless you've decided to make things worse,</v>

123
00:06:29.871 --> 00:06:31.040
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes people do.</v>

124
00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.730
<v Speaker 2>If you're acting towards it and you're acting out the proposition that what</v>

125
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.540
<v Speaker 2>you're acting towards is bending with what you have and so there's no escaping.</v>

126
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:39.373
<v Speaker 2>The world is valued.</v>

127
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:43.820
<v Speaker 2>Proposition number one and this proposition number two would be there's no</v>

128
00:06:43.821 --> 00:06:45.050
<v Speaker 2>escaping the social world,</v>

129
00:06:45.051 --> 00:06:47.210
<v Speaker 2>so if you act other value proposition,</v>

130
00:06:47.211 --> 00:06:49.930
<v Speaker 2>you're going to do it socially because you're surrounded by people.</v>

131
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:50.570
<v Speaker 2>You're not.</v>

132
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:52.460
<v Speaker 2>No Man is an island as they say,</v>

133
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.490
<v Speaker 2>and so if you've worked out the proposition that one thing is better than</v>

134
00:06:55.491 --> 00:06:55.781
<v Speaker 2>another,</v>

135
00:06:55.781 --> 00:06:58.370
<v Speaker 2>it's going to do that with other people and you're going to cooperate with them</v>

136
00:06:58.371 --> 00:07:00.860
<v Speaker 2>and compete with them in relationship to that endeavor.</v>

137
00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:02.330
<v Speaker 2>If you go to law school,</v>

138
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.160
<v Speaker 2>some people are better at school than others.</v>

139
00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:09.380
<v Speaker 2>You go to the source therapist and some people have a natural talent for that.</v>

140
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:10.460
<v Speaker 2>It's like so,</v>

141
00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.380
<v Speaker 2>so what that means essentially,</v>

142
00:07:12.381 --> 00:07:14.210
<v Speaker 2>and I think this is a universal truth.</v>

143
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:17.990
<v Speaker 2>I think that as soon as you implement the value structure in a social situation</v>

144
00:07:17.991 --> 00:07:18.900
<v Speaker 2>and produced a hierarchy,</v>

145
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:20.780
<v Speaker 2>and I think that we know that,</v>

146
00:07:20.781 --> 00:07:23.990
<v Speaker 2>I think that's respected and phenomena like the freedom distribution and price</v>

147
00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:24.843
<v Speaker 2>law,</v>

148
00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.340
<v Speaker 2>that you formulate a hierarchy.</v>

149
00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:31.760
<v Speaker 2>Some people are better at whatever the hierarchy is than others and most people</v>

150
00:07:31.761 --> 00:07:35.090
<v Speaker 2>start to stack up at the boss so you get disproportionate success.</v>

151
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:36.440
<v Speaker 2>At the top along of minority,</v>

152
00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:38.060
<v Speaker 2>and that's a well established,</v>

153
00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:38.903
<v Speaker 2>that's bookmarks,</v>

154
00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:39.440
<v Speaker 2>absurd.</v>

155
00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.250
<v Speaker 2>Even though he made a specific case of it,</v>

156
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.050
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

157
00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:42.390
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

158
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.130
<v Speaker 2>pretend to accumulate the hands of fewer,</v>

159
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.013
<v Speaker 2>fewer people.</v>

160
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:49.430
<v Speaker 2>He met the same people across time and he thought it was only wealth as far as I</v>

161
00:07:49.431 --> 00:07:50.264
<v Speaker 2>can tell,</v>

162
00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.153
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

163
00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:55.640
<v Speaker 2>and they made a number of other mistakes at all over talking to at the moment.</v>

164
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:56.241
<v Speaker 2>So okay,</v>

165
00:07:56.241 --> 00:08:00.710
<v Speaker 2>so you have to act out value in the world and if you do so you're gonna produce</v>

166
00:08:00.711 --> 00:08:01.820
<v Speaker 2>a higher in a new producer,</v>

167
00:08:01.821 --> 00:08:06.080
<v Speaker 2>higher you can produce winners and losers and that actually is a problem because</v>

168
00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.510
<v Speaker 2>of this electric of it has been.</v>

169
00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:11.160
<v Speaker 2>It's actually quite painful than your hierarchy is pretty inclusive,</v>

170
00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.800
<v Speaker 2>especially if they really lose because if you lose the now,</v>

171
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:16.790
<v Speaker 2>if you're way down to zero,</v>

172
00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:19.340
<v Speaker 2>then if you don't have enough to eat,</v>

173
00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:23.050
<v Speaker 2>you don't have medical care like it gets painful happened.</v>

174
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:23.893
<v Speaker 2>It's happened.</v>

175
00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:27.410
<v Speaker 2>Not because it's logically appropriate.</v>

176
00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:28.963
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

177
00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:40.280
<v Speaker 2>so hard about that for a long time with our higher is because what it means is</v>

178
00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:42.123
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

179
00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:49.970
<v Speaker 2>the reality that we face isn't the reality of a hierarchy.</v>

180
00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:52.380
<v Speaker 2>It's the set of possible</v>

181
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:59.200
<v Speaker 2>and the rules that govern operation in a reality that consists of a set of</v>

182
00:09:00.781 --> 00:09:05.781
<v Speaker 2>higher piece aren't the same rules that govern success in a hierarchy.</v>

183
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:11.070
<v Speaker 2>So I can give you a quick example of that.</v>

184
00:09:11.071 --> 00:09:14.340
<v Speaker 2>So imagine you have a child who's playing the game.</v>

185
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:14.940
<v Speaker 2>Soccer,</v>

186
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:15.773
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

187
00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:16.893
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

188
00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.070
<v Speaker 2>for fucking,</v>

189
00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:20.970
<v Speaker 2>since it's Boston Canadian.</v>

190
00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:24.990
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

191
00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:28.990
<v Speaker 2>your kids play hockey and we'd have Easter Gospel clarity,</v>

192
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:32.220
<v Speaker 2>but he's a little stingy with poc and uh,</v>

193
00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.230
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

194
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:35.940
<v Speaker 2>he plays a game.</v>

195
00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:39.070
<v Speaker 2>You and he comes off the ice and they lose and,</v>

196
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:43.350
<v Speaker 2>and stick down at the Smith has a little temper tantrum and uh,</v>

197
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:44.191
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

198
00:09:44.191 --> 00:09:44.610
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

199
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:45.570
<v Speaker 2>you have some sense.</v>

200
00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:48.000
<v Speaker 2>So you take them aside and say,</v>

201
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:48.480
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

202
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.690
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter whether you win or lose,</v>

203
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.470
<v Speaker 2>it's how you play the games.</v>

204
00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:58.680
<v Speaker 2>And he's not happy to hear that because you kind of have a bit of a pout and he</v>

205
00:09:58.681 --> 00:10:02.520
<v Speaker 2>looks at you like there's something wrong with you and he doesn't know what you</v>

206
00:10:02.521 --> 00:10:06.630
<v Speaker 2>mean because of course he's trying to win and you probably encouraged him to</v>

207
00:10:06.631 --> 00:10:07.260
<v Speaker 2>win.</v>

208
00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:08.250
<v Speaker 2>And so when you come out and say,</v>

209
00:10:08.251 --> 00:10:08.760
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

210
00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.010
<v Speaker 2>the win or a how you play the game,</v>

211
00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:12.600
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't know what you mean.</v>

212
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.300
<v Speaker 2>And then when he asked you what do you mean you don't know,</v>

213
00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:22.980
<v Speaker 2>you don't always make your own rules predictory across the set of all possible</v>

214
00:10:22.981 --> 00:10:23.451
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy,</v>

215
00:10:23.451 --> 00:10:27.490
<v Speaker 2>but the rules were within one higher.</v>

216
00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:32.760
<v Speaker 2>And what you're basically telling your job is don't sacrifice the manner in</v>

217
00:10:32.761 --> 00:10:37.761
<v Speaker 2>which you would behave when the set of possible games for victory won your game.</v>

218
00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.460
<v Speaker 2>And that's because black isn't a hockey game.</v>

219
00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.730
<v Speaker 2>It's also not a series of kids.</v>

220
00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:47.210
<v Speaker 2>It's more like a series of hockey games than like one day.</v>

221
00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:50.090
<v Speaker 2>But life is a series of hierarchies,</v>

222
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:51.680
<v Speaker 2>a series of games.</v>

223
00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:52.441
<v Speaker 2>And you might say,</v>

224
00:10:52.441 --> 00:10:54.310
<v Speaker 2>well how do you win a series of games?</v>

225
00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:57.870
<v Speaker 2>And one answer to that is you get invited to play a lot of them.</v>

226
00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:01.590
<v Speaker 2>Anybody that does that,</v>

227
00:11:01.591 --> 00:11:05.550
<v Speaker 2>there's an almost an indefinite number of ways of interpreting the world.</v>

228
00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:08.030
<v Speaker 2>And then that's kind of split the postmodernism,</v>

229
00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.030
<v Speaker 2>say the 1966.</v>

230
00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:13.830
<v Speaker 2>But how do you know how you should interpret a book?</v>

231
00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.033
<v Speaker 2>Fiction.</v>

232
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.110
<v Speaker 2>There's plenty ways to interpret a piece of fiction after our people.</v>

233
00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.420
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

234
00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:25.420
<v Speaker 2>how many stable way of interpreting and if there's no stable way of interpreting</v>

235
00:11:25.741 --> 00:11:25.861
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

236
00:11:25.861 --> 00:11:25.981
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

237
00:11:25.981 --> 00:11:27.610
<v Speaker 2>how do you rank our per patient?</v>

238
00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:31.020
<v Speaker 2>How do you know what interpretation is better than the other on they're actually</v>

239
00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:32.053
<v Speaker 2>what you can.</v>

240
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:33.210
<v Speaker 2>And so you don't.</v>

241
00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.520
<v Speaker 2>And so there's no such in a sense,</v>

242
00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:38.820
<v Speaker 2>there's no reliable judge of quality literature.</v>

243
00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:40.140
<v Speaker 2>It's arbitrary.</v>

244
00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:46.110
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

245
00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:49.320
<v Speaker 2>artificial intelligence people bond at the same time trying to make machines to</v>

246
00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:50.351
<v Speaker 2>proceed the world.</v>

247
00:11:50.351 --> 00:11:54.610
<v Speaker 2>It turns out the borders between things are so easily drawn when we look at the</v>

248
00:11:54.611 --> 00:11:56.470
<v Speaker 2>world and I can see your own blind spots,</v>

249
00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:57.460
<v Speaker 2>no effort on my part.</v>

250
00:11:57.461 --> 00:11:58.121
<v Speaker 2>I just see it.</v>

251
00:11:58.121 --> 00:11:58.810
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

252
00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:01.540
<v Speaker 2>there's three and a half billion years of evolution when into that.</v>

253
00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:03.370
<v Speaker 2>It's an easy problem,</v>

254
00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:04.470
<v Speaker 2>I can solve it,</v>

255
00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:07.870
<v Speaker 2>but not because of any particular color than mine,</v>

256
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:08.220
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

257
00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:12.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm the beneficiary of all this adds and all the selection.</v>

258
00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:14.260
<v Speaker 2>When they did that for three and a half,</v>

259
00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:15.340
<v Speaker 2>building your process,</v>

260
00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:16.630
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't mean it's easy.</v>

261
00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:17.600
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't have taken old.</v>

262
00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:22.610
<v Speaker 2>That gap and all those years to manage it was easy because it very large number</v>

263
00:12:22.691 --> 00:12:24.400
<v Speaker 2>of ways of interpreting rope.</v>

264
00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:29.470
<v Speaker 2>That does not mean that there's a very large number of ways of interpreting the</v>

265
00:12:29.471 --> 00:12:34.090
<v Speaker 2>world and that's where the postmodernists gone seriously wrong.</v>

266
00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:39.490
<v Speaker 2>So because think about the constraints that the one you with regards to how you</v>

267
00:12:39.491 --> 00:12:40.660
<v Speaker 2>have to improve the world.</v>

268
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:41.740
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

269
00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:44.920
<v Speaker 2>you can't just sit there or you'll suffer and die.</v>

270
00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.920
<v Speaker 2>So you have to go out there and act in the world and that means there's,</v>

271
00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:48.731
<v Speaker 2>there's problems.</v>

272
00:12:48.731 --> 00:12:52.570
<v Speaker 2>You have to solve it or basically grounded in your motivational structure.</v>

273
00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:53.010
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

274
00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:54.040
<v Speaker 2>you have to eat,</v>

275
00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:55.300
<v Speaker 2>you have to find water,</v>

276
00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.500
<v Speaker 2>you have to find shelter,</v>

277
00:12:56.501 --> 00:12:57.930
<v Speaker 2>you have to regulate your temperature.</v>

278
00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.200
<v Speaker 2>You have to play with others.</v>

279
00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:00.760
<v Speaker 2>You have to find a mate.</v>

280
00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:01.570
<v Speaker 2>You have to.</v>

281
00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:04.630
<v Speaker 2>You have to pursue something that produces a certain amount of positive</v>

282
00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.080
<v Speaker 2>emotional pain,</v>

283
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:11.160
<v Speaker 2>don't want to be anxious like and you don't like you coming quit with all of</v>

284
00:13:11.411 --> 00:13:16.411
<v Speaker 2>those systems and also for your attention and so you have to address those</v>

285
00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:21.490
<v Speaker 2>issues or or things that are critical Disney for you when it's worse than so not</v>

286
00:13:21.491 --> 00:13:26.491
<v Speaker 2>only are you are you governed by those biological God's let's say and are in</v>

287
00:13:26.831 --> 00:13:28.060
<v Speaker 2>some sense they're there,</v>

288
00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:33.460
<v Speaker 2>but you have to figure out how to address those problems today because you're</v>

289
00:13:33.461 --> 00:13:34.630
<v Speaker 2>not just going to be around today.</v>

290
00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:35.800
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be on today,</v>

291
00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:36.840
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow,</v>

292
00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.200
<v Speaker 2>next week and next month.</v>

293
00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.060
<v Speaker 2>We're now in five years from now,</v>

294
00:13:40.061 --> 00:13:40.841
<v Speaker 2>10 years from now,</v>

295
00:13:40.841 --> 00:13:43.660
<v Speaker 2>so whatever solution you come up with today,</v>

296
00:13:43.661 --> 00:13:44.494
<v Speaker 2>which might be,</v>

297
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:45.790
<v Speaker 2>let's draw the bank,</v>

298
00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:49.510
<v Speaker 2>has the word down the road and let's rob a bank.</v>

299
00:13:49.511 --> 00:13:51.700
<v Speaker 2>Mike worked quite nicely today and next week,</v>

300
00:13:51.701 --> 00:13:53.380
<v Speaker 2>but as a five year strategy,</v>

301
00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:55.070
<v Speaker 2>it's a problem with the idea of the one.</v>

302
00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.090
<v Speaker 2>We know that because you can say,</v>

303
00:13:58.091 --> 00:13:58.271
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

304
00:13:58.271 --> 00:13:59.320
<v Speaker 2>don't be an impulsive.</v>

305
00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:01.660
<v Speaker 2>Well why not?</v>

306
00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:02.410
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

307
00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:04.620
<v Speaker 2>because it's medium to longterm strategy.</v>

308
00:14:04.621 --> 00:14:04.751
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

309
00:14:04.751 --> 00:14:07.420
<v Speaker 2>That's why it doesn't work very well.</v>

310
00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:09.423
<v Speaker 2>Polarization</v>

311
00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:12.740
<v Speaker 2>in society,</v>

312
00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:15.940
<v Speaker 2>and I think the universities are</v>

313
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:24.680
<v Speaker 2>degrees and I think it's partly because the intelligentsia isn't west,</v>

314
00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.880
<v Speaker 2>has never prompted to come to terms with their</v>

315
00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:39.610
<v Speaker 2>listening complicitness in it.</v>

316
00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:44.190
<v Speaker 2>What happened in radical left societies be sorted out</v>

317
00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:46.673
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

318
00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:50.730
<v Speaker 2>published lubricant.</v>

319
00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:58.680
<v Speaker 2>It became for a time completely unacceptable to profess intellectual</v>

320
00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.750
<v Speaker 2>admiration for the Marxist doctrine,</v>

321
00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:09.260
<v Speaker 2>but and I think what happened in France,</v>

322
00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.940
<v Speaker 2>the French intellectuals,</v>

323
00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:17.260
<v Speaker 2>the people who dominate the particularly pathological end of the social sciences</v>

324
00:15:18.051 --> 00:15:21.530
<v Speaker 2>and the humanities in the university has played the sleight of hand and</v>

325
00:15:21.531 --> 00:15:26.531
<v Speaker 2>transformed them that now ultimately toxic Marxism into the current theories of</v>

326
00:15:27.381 --> 00:15:31.600
<v Speaker 2>identity politics playing out in front of us where the proper we to look.</v>

327
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:36.670
<v Speaker 2>The world is the war against every other group with a narrative,</v>

328
00:15:37.971 --> 00:15:38.810
<v Speaker 2>the whole pressure,</v>

329
00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:40.010
<v Speaker 2>oppressor and victim,</v>

330
00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.880
<v Speaker 2>and that leads nowhere.</v>

331
00:15:43.881 --> 00:15:44.714
<v Speaker 2>Good</v>

332
00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:48.410
<v Speaker 2>on the left leads to exactly</v>

333
00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.480
<v Speaker 2>leads to college campuses that are so repressive.</v>

334
00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:54.320
<v Speaker 2>Premiums will go tell jokes.</v>

335
00:15:54.321 --> 00:15:59.321
<v Speaker 2>They're in more a good thing because the tyrant is definitely someone who</v>

336
00:15:59.541 --> 00:16:00.800
<v Speaker 2>doesn't like Comedians,</v>

337
00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:15.260
<v Speaker 2>especially as they're making fun of you because especially if you have any</v>

338
00:16:15.261 --> 00:16:20.261
<v Speaker 2>authority because maybe they'll remind you of why you're going and you went into</v>

339
00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:24.080
<v Speaker 2>attire and that would be a good thing to be developed.</v>

340
00:16:24.081 --> 00:16:27.520
<v Speaker 2>We hope for as your level of authority increases the west,</v>

341
00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:30.770
<v Speaker 2>that's where you want to hit this real</v>

342
00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:35.810
<v Speaker 2>subjective experiences like meeting are real.</v>

343
00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:39.740
<v Speaker 2>It's not a strong theory about as far as I'm concerned,</v>

344
00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:43.690
<v Speaker 2>I think that you can make a very strong case and I think you could make</v>

345
00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.420
<v Speaker 2>scientific case for this as well.</v>

346
00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:53.170
<v Speaker 2>That meaning is an extension of the sense of need and invalid when you're doing</v>

347
00:16:53.691 --> 00:16:58.691
<v Speaker 2>something worthwhile is actually the most profound to instinct that you have.</v>

348
00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:02.840
<v Speaker 2>It's the most reliable thing there is.</v>

349
00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:04.580
<v Speaker 2>It's the most real thing.</v>

350
00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:15.160
<v Speaker 2>I spent quite a bit of time studying how the brain works and you have instincts</v>

351
00:17:17.691 --> 00:17:20.890
<v Speaker 2>that orient you towards learning a very fundamental instinct.</v>

352
00:17:20.891 --> 00:17:22.160
<v Speaker 2>This is called the orientee,</v>

353
00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:26.750
<v Speaker 2>reflexively discovered by Russian neuropsychologist back in the 19 sixties.</v>

354
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:32.060
<v Speaker 2>You Orient towards things that surprise you and that's what opens the door to</v>

355
00:17:32.061 --> 00:17:36.830
<v Speaker 2>learning and you can optimize that process of learning methods,</v>

356
00:17:36.831 --> 00:17:38.420
<v Speaker 2>zone of proximal development,</v>

357
00:17:38.421 --> 00:17:39.254
<v Speaker 2>but therapists,</v>

358
00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:41.930
<v Speaker 2>Zocor or something like that,</v>

359
00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:45.410
<v Speaker 2>and it's an indication that you're living on the edge.</v>

360
00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:48.840
<v Speaker 2>On the edge is where secure.</v>

361
00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:51.730
<v Speaker 2>Stabilize yourself</v>

362
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:54.103
<v Speaker 2>out there.</v>

363
00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:55.320
<v Speaker 2>Don't understand.</v>

364
00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:02.080
<v Speaker 2>It's an exciting place to be a lecturer and meaningful place in the region.</v>

365
00:18:04.321 --> 00:18:05.250
<v Speaker 2>It's a meaningful place.</v>

366
00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:08.100
<v Speaker 2>That's actually where you should be.</v>

367
00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:09.540
<v Speaker 2>You're secure,</v>

368
00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:11.180
<v Speaker 2>you're practicing what you don't,</v>

369
00:18:11.181 --> 00:18:12.880
<v Speaker 2>but you're getting better at it over time.</v>

370
00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:18.470
<v Speaker 2>It's a place where your adaptation in the real sense is expanding at an optimal</v>

371
00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:19.540
<v Speaker 2>rate.</v>

372
00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:24.540
<v Speaker 2>It's a place where you're offering so you're going to be in a way that suits</v>

373
00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:26.410
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

374
00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:30.260
<v Speaker 2>read to the future in a way that's going to be good for your family when it's</v>

375
00:18:30.261 --> 00:18:31.470
<v Speaker 2>going to be good for your community.</v>

376
00:18:31.471 --> 00:18:33.090
<v Speaker 2>So all these things stack up.</v>

377
00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:38.120
<v Speaker 2>Harmonious sense of meaning tells you when you're orienting reflects that helps</v>

378
00:18:38.881 --> 00:18:41.460
<v Speaker 2>you identify where you should be standing,</v>

379
00:18:41.461 --> 00:18:42.630
<v Speaker 2>wherever you are,</v>

380
00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.290
<v Speaker 2>wherever you should be communicating,</v>

381
00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:45.361
<v Speaker 2>listening,</v>

382
00:18:45.361 --> 00:18:46.350
<v Speaker 2>wherever you are.</v>

383
00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:49.360
<v Speaker 2>If you pay attention to that advertisement in meaning been,</v>

384
00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:49.891
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

385
00:18:49.891 --> 00:18:51.150
<v Speaker 2>you have meaningful life,</v>

386
00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:52.620
<v Speaker 2>which is a very useful thing,</v>

387
00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:53.563
<v Speaker 2>but secondly,</v>

388
00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:57.510
<v Speaker 2>you are exactly where you should be right here now,</v>

389
00:18:58.510 --> 00:18:59.910
<v Speaker 2>so that's a good thing to note too,</v>

390
00:18:59.911 --> 00:19:04.911
<v Speaker 2>because the meeting madness certainly have pain as a meeting.</v>

391
00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.180
<v Speaker 2>I know this trick of argument.</v>

392
00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:10.230
<v Speaker 2>You're so fucking bad.</v>

393
00:19:10.231 --> 00:19:11.280
<v Speaker 2>It's not very useful,</v>

394
00:19:11.281 --> 00:19:12.970
<v Speaker 2>so we can certainly establish that.</v>

395
00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:14.393
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you</v>

396
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:16.800
<v Speaker 2>might say,</v>

397
00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:17.400
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

398
00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:20.310
<v Speaker 2>what about the meetings that help you transcend the pain and suffering?</v>

399
00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:26.010
<v Speaker 2>Turns out they are the most critical thing.</v>

400
00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:44.680
<v Speaker 2>What looks like to</v>

401
00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:55.160
<v Speaker 2>me about the whole week in front of the idea I'm facing the and restructuring</v>

402
00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:01.470
<v Speaker 2>was her own reflections of the same.</v>

403
00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:05.920
<v Speaker 2>The idea of facing the dragging until people like all of that,</v>

404
00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:10.970
<v Speaker 2>almost ancient heroic ideas and ideas that are associated with an emergent</v>

405
00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:12.030
<v Speaker 2>ethnic girl.</v>

406
00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:13.560
<v Speaker 2>Variants of the same thing.</v>

407
00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:15.180
<v Speaker 2>Girl,</v>

408
00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:19.080
<v Speaker 2>our attempts to picture what it would be like to be the proper human being.</v>

409
00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:21.070
<v Speaker 2>Religious stories heard attempt,</v>

410
00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:23.880
<v Speaker 2>but if you were ever thinking it could be,</v>

411
00:20:23.881 --> 00:20:24.770
<v Speaker 2>what would you be like?</v>

412
00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:25.400
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

413
00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.980
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty complicated because you're really complicated.</v>

414
00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:30.110
<v Speaker 2>All we can get images and stories,</v>

415
00:20:30.111 --> 00:20:31.120
<v Speaker 2>but what might be like,</v>

416
00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:32.680
<v Speaker 2>we can't articulate it fully,</v>

417
00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.233
<v Speaker 2>what were you,</v>

418
00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:39.900
<v Speaker 2>what we all need to be in that because it's the thing that will redeem us from</v>

419
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.823
<v Speaker 2>the house</v>

420
00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:43.320
<v Speaker 2>and so</v>

421
00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:45.751
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

422
00:20:45.751 --> 00:20:46.584
<v Speaker 2>A roll.</v>

423
00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:48.340
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

424
00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:53.340
<v Speaker 2>this isn't just a battle between two arbitrary ways of interpreting the world.</v>

425
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.440
<v Speaker 2>One of those ways is wrong.</v>

426
00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:58.173
<v Speaker 2>It's the</v>

427
00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:00.220
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

428
00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:03.980
<v Speaker 2>You just leads to catastrophe rounded property infrastructure,</v>

429
00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:04.843
<v Speaker 2>reality,</v>

430
00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:10.580
<v Speaker 2>but the idea of individual who bears the burden of being property faces his or</v>

431
00:21:12.341 --> 00:21:14.390
<v Speaker 2>her suffering in front school level,</v>

432
00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:18.310
<v Speaker 2>who faces the unknown restructures society would.</v>

433
00:21:18.311 --> 00:21:23.311
<v Speaker 2>It becomes tyrannical at ethic of fair play and courage that's deep.</v>

434
00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:26.710
<v Speaker 2>The were oriented towards.</v>

435
00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:30.360
<v Speaker 2>It manifests itself in our instinct for it.</v>

436
00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:32.620
<v Speaker 2>It allows us to live with ourselves,</v>

437
00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:34.450
<v Speaker 2>the clear conscience,</v>

438
00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:39.680
<v Speaker 2>able to everything we have accepts our social world,</v>

439
00:21:40.091 --> 00:21:40.840
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

440
00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:43.660
<v Speaker 2>And keeps us a good distance away from.</v>

441
00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:49.270
<v Speaker 2>And that's what we could do and that's where we need to be</v>

442
00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:56.700
<v Speaker 2>thanked</v>

443

465
00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:23.430
<v Speaker 2>you first because this is a 10th or 11th and I'm not kidding.</v>

466
00:23:24.281 --> 00:23:28.730
<v Speaker 2>When I tell people you are different every single month and is that part of your</v>

467
00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:31.413
<v Speaker 2>plan?</v>

468
00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:43.400
<v Speaker 2>Know</v>

469
00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:46.513
<v Speaker 2>pretty good</v>

470
00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:50.360
<v Speaker 2>audience because then you can see what you're saying.</v>

471
00:23:50.361 --> 00:23:51.194
<v Speaker 2>Makes Sense.</v>

472
00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:52.790
<v Speaker 2>That's the whole,</v>

473
00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:56.480
<v Speaker 2>that's the secret of free speech in some stamps strength because that's how you</v>

474
00:23:56.481 --> 00:23:57.060
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>

475
00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:58.480
<v Speaker 2>It's just the thing</v>

476
00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:07.170
<v Speaker 2>to see what we're thinking.</v>

477
00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:12.160
<v Speaker 2>We're going do that by communicating with people and seeing what happens when</v>

478
00:24:12.161 --> 00:24:14.290
<v Speaker 2>you see where the consequences are.</v>

479
00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:18.380
<v Speaker 2>I've been in a battle in some sense in Canada</v>

480
00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:21.830
<v Speaker 2>with people who are</v>

481
00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:28.380
<v Speaker 2>so they're so careless that they think it's okay to introduce legislation that</v>

482
00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:31.580
<v Speaker 2>restricts people's.</v>

483
00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:35.720
<v Speaker 2>Asked me to communicate like I don't get that.</v>

484
00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:38.190
<v Speaker 2>It's a sin</v>

485
00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:43.220
<v Speaker 2>to this political debate,</v>

486
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:44.143
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

487
00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:46.400
<v Speaker 2>but it's not political as far as I'm concerned.</v>

488
00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:50.840
<v Speaker 2>What's happened is that the politicians did something that wasn't political</v>

489
00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:54.060
<v Speaker 2>thing jumped outside of their proper domain of,</v>

490
00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:56.690
<v Speaker 2>of activity.</v>

491
00:24:56.890 --> 00:25:00.410
<v Speaker 2>It was like they went down to the constitutional level or even lower than that,</v>

492
00:25:00.411 --> 00:25:00.610
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

493
00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:00.830
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

494
00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:01.191
<v Speaker 2>it's okay.</v>

495
00:25:01.191 --> 00:25:02.450
<v Speaker 2>You can mess around with this.</v>

496
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:03.980
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's not okay.</v>

497
00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:05.240
<v Speaker 2>You're not gonna.</v>

498
00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:09.500
<v Speaker 2>Justify telling people what did they can say on the ground with some fictitious</v>

499
00:25:09.501 --> 00:25:10.334
<v Speaker 2>compassion,</v>

500
00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.590
<v Speaker 2>freedom nonfic dishes to passion for that.</v>

501
00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:13.663
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

502
00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:20.310
<v Speaker 2>thank you.</v>

503
00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:23.690
<v Speaker 2>Don't,</v>

504
00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:28.690
<v Speaker 2>because you're kind of predict the supreme court ruled that compelled speech was</v>

505
00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:30.293
<v Speaker 2>unconstitutional.</v>

506
00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:36.440
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

507
00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:45.640
<v Speaker 2>How do you remain so calm in the face of overwhelming close mindedness?</v>

508
00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:48.891
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

509
00:25:48.891 --> 00:25:49.724
<v Speaker 2>If I do.</v>

510
00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:56.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably.</v>

511
00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:01.460
<v Speaker 2>There are much less than would appear in public,</v>

512
00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:03.403
<v Speaker 2>so my family,</v>

513
00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:08.600
<v Speaker 2>my wife who's hiding somewhere in the audience.</v>

514
00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:15.300
<v Speaker 2>Thank that.</v>

515
00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:23.220
<v Speaker 2>I have pretty good support network is very much with being on this kids or</v>

516
00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:28.543
<v Speaker 2>parents</v>

517
00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:34.550
<v Speaker 2>or friends around me watch me going through all this and criticizes me when they</v>

518
00:26:34.551 --> 00:26:35.620
<v Speaker 2>think it's necessary,</v>

519
00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:37.553
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

520
00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:43.040
<v Speaker 2>have all of this clinical experience that helps you.</v>

521
00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:47.830
<v Speaker 2>When I talk with Katherine Newman and</v>

522
00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:53.233
<v Speaker 2>she.</v>

523
00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:56.753
<v Speaker 2>She</v>

524
00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:02.220
<v Speaker 2>sat down and talked to her when the cameras were off.</v>

525
00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:07.200
<v Speaker 2>She was quite friendly and then the counters when she was a whole different</v>

526
00:27:07.201 --> 00:27:09.750
<v Speaker 2>person and I saw that</v>

527
00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:13.050
<v Speaker 2>don't be thinking you</v>

528
00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:16.523
<v Speaker 2>don't</v>

529
00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:22.093
<v Speaker 2>know</v>

530
00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:25.780
<v Speaker 2>what's going on here,</v>

531
00:27:25.781 --> 00:27:26.614
<v Speaker 2>but it just.</v>

532
00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:30.080
<v Speaker 2>So I just watched her and I</v>

533
00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:38.340
<v Speaker 2>figured out almost immediately that whoever she was interviewing for no</v>

534
00:27:38.341 --> 00:27:39.510
<v Speaker 2>resemblance to me.</v>

535
00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:42.983
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

536
00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:48.360
<v Speaker 2>Talking to journalists and I think the New York Times article is a good example</v>

537
00:27:48.361 --> 00:27:53.361
<v Speaker 2>of that was that was a strange experience because the young woman who wrote that</v>

538
00:27:53.551 --> 00:27:54.001
<v Speaker 2>article,</v>

539
00:27:54.001 --> 00:27:56.880
<v Speaker 2>she hung around with me for about two days and she was in my house,</v>

540
00:27:58.370 --> 00:28:00.800
<v Speaker 2>my house when she called the Chamber of horrors,</v>

541
00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:04.010
<v Speaker 2>which</v>

542
00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:11.110
<v Speaker 2>does have some rough in because</v>

543
00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:25.663
<v Speaker 2>she was.</v>

544
00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:27.090
<v Speaker 2>She was very friendly,</v>

545
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:30.110
<v Speaker 2>very open to it.</v>

546
00:28:30.111 --> 00:28:35.111
<v Speaker 2>I'm very supportive and engaged and apparently during that was true and</v>

547
00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:40.111
<v Speaker 2>he might say,</v>

548
00:28:40.111 --> 00:28:40.291
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

549
00:28:40.291 --> 00:28:44.850
<v Speaker 2>why bother talking to journalists and that sort of thing happens is first of</v>

550
00:28:44.851 --> 00:28:44.951
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

551
00:28:44.951 --> 00:28:48.430
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't happen all the time by many,</v>

552
00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:49.480
<v Speaker 2>many journalists.</v>

553
00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:53.970
<v Speaker 2>It's like 200 newspapers in Canada a year ago came up with support what it was</v>

554
00:28:53.971 --> 00:28:54.660
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>

555
00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:55.590
<v Speaker 2>so you have to keep the map.</v>

556
00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:56.493
<v Speaker 2>The good.</v>

557
00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:58.170
<v Speaker 2>Can't complain about that,</v>

558
00:28:58.440 --> 00:28:59.310
<v Speaker 2>but more importantly,</v>

559
00:28:59.311 --> 00:29:00.730
<v Speaker 2>I think it's not so bad.</v>

560
00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:02.160
<v Speaker 2>People revealed their hands.</v>

561
00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:07.320
<v Speaker 2>If you talk to people and watched and listen,</v>

562
00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:11.490
<v Speaker 2>then they revealed your hands so everyone can see what they're playing and</v>

563
00:29:11.491 --> 00:29:12.600
<v Speaker 2>that's happened to me</v>

564
00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:15.330
<v Speaker 2>40 times.</v>

565
00:29:15.331 --> 00:29:17.880
<v Speaker 2>Probably maybe more in the last two years.</v>

566
00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:19.530
<v Speaker 2>People come after me and say,</v>

567
00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:19.711
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

568
00:29:19.711 --> 00:29:20.700
<v Speaker 2>you must be this</v>

569
00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:26.650
<v Speaker 2>incarnation of a saint tammany figure your way.</v>

570
00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:28.730
<v Speaker 2>That's not true</v>

571
00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:34.790
<v Speaker 2>and what's happening in various that it's been harder on the journalists than on</v>

572
00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:38.360
<v Speaker 2>me and I'm not calling people to continue.</v>

573
00:29:38.361 --> 00:29:38.641
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

574
00:29:38.641 --> 00:29:43.180
<v Speaker 2>I have good friends who think that the New York Times basically some as a</v>

575
00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:44.900
<v Speaker 2>respectable figure,</v>

576
00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:48.400
<v Speaker 2>but I'm actually concerned with being respectful.</v>

577
00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:01.960
<v Speaker 2>So you're saying if you want to sleep with tech,</v>

578
00:30:12.910 --> 00:30:15.300
<v Speaker 2>you could ask one question.</v>

579
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:20.263
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

580
00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:23.470
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to ask them how you figured out what I figured out</v>

581
00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:26.603
<v Speaker 2>things</v>

582
00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:30.910
<v Speaker 2>incalculably intelligent.</v>

583
00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:31.660
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

584
00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:32.493
<v Speaker 2>when I read,</v>

585
00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:38.440
<v Speaker 2>I read everything he wrote in the 19 nineties about stuff wasn't like I</v>

586
00:30:40.121 --> 00:30:45.040
<v Speaker 2>understood all of it because it's tough going and I've just done to figure out</v>

587
00:30:45.041 --> 00:30:46.840
<v Speaker 2>how he can figure out what you did.</v>

588
00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:49.010
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you have maybe you know,</v>

589
00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:52.520
<v Speaker 2>people do one in a billion.</v>

590
00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:53.320
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

591
00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:58.320
<v Speaker 2>maybe it was one in a billion so he could see things that I can't figure out how</v>

592
00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:01.803
<v Speaker 2>anyone</v>

593
00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:04.163
<v Speaker 2>see</v>

594
00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:07.870
<v Speaker 2>if you have a gift for imagination,</v>

595
00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:09.103
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

596
00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:11.400
<v Speaker 2>some people are very good at articulation,</v>

597
00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:15.790
<v Speaker 2>every good thinking in words and some people are good at thinking in pictures</v>

598
00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:18.430
<v Speaker 2>and he seemed to be really good at both.</v>

599
00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:18.920
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

600
00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.170
<v Speaker 2>we had a tremendous advantage.</v>

601
00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:26.250
<v Speaker 2>Dream essentially infant learn how to do that and seem to learn all sorts of</v>

602
00:31:26.711 --> 00:31:28.350
<v Speaker 2>things from his weekend dreams.</v>

603
00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:30.660
<v Speaker 2>If I can do that little bit.</v>

604
00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:33.310
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes when I'm doing therapy with people,</v>

605
00:31:33.311 --> 00:31:34.144
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

606
00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:37.960
<v Speaker 2>I'll be listening to the clinical picture of my head or a little fragment of the</v>

607
00:31:37.961 --> 00:31:38.794
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>

608
00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:39.490
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

609
00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:40.900
<v Speaker 2>what country it comes with,</v>

610
00:31:40.901 --> 00:31:45.070
<v Speaker 2>imagery and it's sort of in background and then I'll notice it and then I'll</v>

611
00:31:45.071 --> 00:31:45.904
<v Speaker 2>tell them,</v>

612
00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:48.940
<v Speaker 2>look when you said that this happened in my imagination,</v>

613
00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:53.530
<v Speaker 2>we can take apart the relationship between what they said and what happened in</v>

614
00:31:53.531 --> 00:31:57.190
<v Speaker 2>my imagination that usually ship substantial light on what's going on.</v>

615
00:31:57.540 --> 00:31:59.440
<v Speaker 2>But he was an absolute master at that.</v>

616
00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:01.450
<v Speaker 2>So I do.</v>

617
00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:06.380
<v Speaker 2>I find out from him how he managed that and maybe you could say it,</v>

618
00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:09.070
<v Speaker 2>but I sure like to know I've met anyone like that.</v>

619
00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:15.110
<v Speaker 2>So there were a couple of questions here asking you to clarify.</v>

620
00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:16.071
<v Speaker 2>It's forced.</v>

621
00:32:16.071 --> 00:32:16.904
<v Speaker 2>Phenomenal.</v>

622
00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:22.550
<v Speaker 2>Should we bust out their phones for this one recording of this?</v>

623
00:32:22.551 --> 00:32:24.920
<v Speaker 2>If you can do it in two minutes and we'll throw it up on twitter.</v>

624
00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:27.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

625
00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:33.410
<v Speaker 2>You guys want to punch out your phones for this one just so we get some video</v>

626
00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:35.870
<v Speaker 2>with your answers for the</v>

627
00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:38.750
<v Speaker 2>enemies respond well to.</v>

628
00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:47.550
<v Speaker 2>So I'll,</v>

629
00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:48.770
<v Speaker 2>I'll ask the question.</v>

630
00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:56.090
<v Speaker 2>So the question is,</v>

631
00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:00.350
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean by force without doing well?</v>

632
00:33:00.351 --> 00:33:01.350
<v Speaker 2>We could start by saying,</v>

633
00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:02.270
<v Speaker 2>don't be.</v>

634
00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:07.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean taking innocent women at gunpoint and happy over to useless man</v>

635
00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:11.430
<v Speaker 2>accusation.</v>

636
00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:14.700
<v Speaker 2>It was really interesting to watch that unfold.</v>

637
00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:18.890
<v Speaker 2>What I meant was that monogamy as,</v>

638
00:33:18.891 --> 00:33:19.160
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

639
00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:23.510
<v Speaker 2>as something that's socially valued is,</v>

640
00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:26.480
<v Speaker 2>appears to be essentially a human universal.</v>

641
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:31.830
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean that human beings are universally monogamous because officers,</v>

642
00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:34.380
<v Speaker 2>we're not serially monogamous in.</v>

643
00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:37.610
<v Speaker 2>Some people have multiple partners and all of that,</v>

644
00:33:37.611 --> 00:33:41.330
<v Speaker 2>but here's a strong proclivity across.</v>

645
00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:46.780
<v Speaker 2>No society can tilt towards monogamy and the enforcement is social norms.</v>

646
00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:53.600
<v Speaker 2>Think about it and I can't believe that I have to say this</v>

647
00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:56.650
<v Speaker 2>just gets buried.</v>

648
00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:57.890
<v Speaker 2>And he comes home and he says,</v>

649
00:33:58.580 --> 00:33:59.090
<v Speaker 2>Dad,</v>

650
00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:00.760
<v Speaker 2>I've been screwing around.</v>

651
00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:05.513
<v Speaker 2>Know</v>

652
00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:10.550
<v Speaker 2>you're not happy about that.</v>

653
00:34:10.610 --> 00:34:13.520
<v Speaker 2>And he doesn't count because he knows you're not going to be happy about it.</v>

654
00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:15.770
<v Speaker 2>And that's the fourth monogamy.</v>

655
00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:17.480
<v Speaker 2>It's part of the social structure.</v>

656
00:34:17.481 --> 00:34:18.330
<v Speaker 2>It's like what?</v>

657
00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:20.250
<v Speaker 2>It's like.</v>

658
00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:20.420
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

659
00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:24.620
<v Speaker 2>most people want a monogamous relationship and if they enter into a relationship</v>

660
00:34:24.621 --> 00:34:25.050
<v Speaker 2>with someone,</v>

661
00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:26.180
<v Speaker 2>they're not happy.</v>

662
00:34:26.181 --> 00:34:28.960
<v Speaker 2>If that person goes to the surround view,</v>

663
00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:29.880
<v Speaker 2>he would be happy.</v>

664
00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:30.713
<v Speaker 2>If that happens.</v>

665
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.560
<v Speaker 2>That's part of enforced.</v>

666
00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:38.300
<v Speaker 2>It's part of this moment and you might have noticed the problem.</v>

667
00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:41.240
<v Speaker 2>Get polygamy is actually illegal.</v>

668
00:34:41.490 --> 00:34:43.780
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>

669
00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:46.093
<v Speaker 2>It's</v>

670
00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:54.460
<v Speaker 2>be known for 100 years after most of whom are left leaning by the way,</v>

671
00:34:54.771 --> 00:34:56.180
<v Speaker 2>because that's how it goes.</v>

672
00:34:56.480 --> 00:35:01.480
<v Speaker 2>That monogamous social structures are one of the ways we keep children</v>

673
00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:08.180
<v Speaker 2>raised property so that they have a relatively stable environment and then you</v>

674
00:35:08.181 --> 00:35:09.890
<v Speaker 2>keep male aggression,</v>

675
00:35:09.891 --> 00:35:14.120
<v Speaker 2>especially the aggression of young men under some degree of social control.</v>

676
00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:15.770
<v Speaker 2>It's not a mystery.</v>

677
00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:20.340
<v Speaker 2>The fact that I got in trouble for that is it's kind of a miracle foot</v>

678
00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:25.320
<v Speaker 2>notice that worth it.</v>

679
00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:27.220
<v Speaker 2>Like almost every way.</v>

680
00:35:28.570 --> 00:35:33.360
<v Speaker 2>The same thing happens all over the world and alternative diverse societies and</v>

681
00:35:33.370 --> 00:35:35.190
<v Speaker 2>then when we deviate from that,</v>

682
00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:38.370
<v Speaker 2>there's a price to be paid so and so.</v>

683
00:35:38.371 --> 00:35:43.371
<v Speaker 2>That's why like I'm a New York Times pariah is because I think the minority all</v>

684
00:35:44.671 --> 00:35:47.160
<v Speaker 2>things considered is a good idea.</v>

685
00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:57.890
<v Speaker 2>Thank</v>

686
00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:13.343
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

687
00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:20.040
<v Speaker 2>Thank</v>

688
00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:22.483
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

689
00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:24.993
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

690
00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:34.040
<v Speaker 2>do you have any advice for someone who correctly identified versus a bad choice</v>

691
00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:38.920
<v Speaker 2>but has difficulty following</v>

692
00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:44.173
<v Speaker 2>through</v>

693
00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:56.993
<v Speaker 2>Christ</v>

694
00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:00.333
<v Speaker 2>to someone</v>

695
00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:03.340
<v Speaker 2>who is white?</v>

696
00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:09.940
<v Speaker 2>It's harder to do the right thing off that because of</v>

697
00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:14.670
<v Speaker 2>the precedent for the future is the sacrificial gesture to do</v>

698
00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:18.840
<v Speaker 2>sacrifice and so interesting.</v>

699
00:37:18.841 --> 00:37:23.430
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the things I about quite a bit in promos to figure that out.</v>

700
00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:24.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm really happy about that,</v>

701
00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:27.900
<v Speaker 2>that I sent them ritual sacrifice.</v>

702
00:37:27.901 --> 00:37:28.081
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

703
00:37:28.081 --> 00:37:29.620
<v Speaker 2>you read a book sacrificial rituals,</v>

704
00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:32.340
<v Speaker 2>what those people up to,</v>

705
00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:34.140
<v Speaker 2>no burden.</v>

706
00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:35.903
<v Speaker 2>It's like</v>

707
00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:43.170
<v Speaker 2>one of the most fundamental discoveries that human beings ever made.</v>

708
00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:47.700
<v Speaker 2>It's absolutely unbelievable that we figured out that you can sacrifice</v>

709
00:37:47.701 --> 00:37:49.640
<v Speaker 2>something of value in the president,</v>

710
00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:52.440
<v Speaker 2>gain something of value in the future.</v>

711
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:54.490
<v Speaker 2>That's the future,</v>

712
00:37:54.491 --> 00:37:54.660
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

713
00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:59.660
<v Speaker 2>That's the delayed gratification scaffold on which context,</v>

714
00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:07.020
<v Speaker 2>thanks</v>

715
00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:10.530
<v Speaker 2>before we can understand it,</v>

716
00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:12.640
<v Speaker 2>and so that's what those rituals were about,</v>

717
00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:16.530
<v Speaker 2>was acting that out for thousands of years before we can say,</v>

718
00:38:16.531 --> 00:38:17.364
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

719
00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:19.840
<v Speaker 2>what sort of sacrifices did your parents think?</v>

720
00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:22.640
<v Speaker 2>And here's what we know,</v>

721
00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:24.360
<v Speaker 2>what the sacrificial is.</v>

722
00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:29.700
<v Speaker 2>So it's difficult to sacrifice the present for the future because it means the</v>

723
00:38:29.701 --> 00:38:31.610
<v Speaker 2>foregoing of gratification,</v>

724
00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:32.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

725
00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:34.410
<v Speaker 2>you need to be gratifying now,</v>

726
00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:36.880
<v Speaker 2>have some water now.</v>

727
00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:38.900
<v Speaker 2>You have to have sex now,</v>

728
00:38:40.350 --> 00:38:42.260
<v Speaker 2>but for the future is also we'll.</v>

729
00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:46.070
<v Speaker 2>So you have to learn how to balance the future was the precedent.</v>

730
00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:46.923
<v Speaker 2>That's hard.</v>

731
00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:47.650
<v Speaker 2>And I would say,</v>

732
00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:49.880
<v Speaker 2>well you do that the same way.</v>

733
00:38:49.881 --> 00:38:50.980
<v Speaker 2>If you do that for yourself,</v>

734
00:38:50.981 --> 00:38:53.920
<v Speaker 2>the same what you do for a child that you care for it is that you,</v>

735
00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:54.920
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

736
00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:57.840
<v Speaker 2>you discipline yourself gently.</v>

737
00:38:57.910 --> 00:39:02.380
<v Speaker 2>And the way you do that is by setting yourself tasks that are hard but possible.</v>

738
00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:03.443
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

739
00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:06.940
<v Speaker 2>you have to get up in rule four,</v>

740
00:39:06.941 --> 00:39:07.481
<v Speaker 2>I think it is.</v>

741
00:39:07.481 --> 00:39:11.570
<v Speaker 2>Compare yourself with who you were yesterday and with some,</v>

742
00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:13.210
<v Speaker 2>with someone else's today,</v>

743
00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:16.990
<v Speaker 2>it's like what you want to do is be a little better than you were yesterday.</v>

744
00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:19.330
<v Speaker 2>And you might say what's a little bit,</v>

745
00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:20.200
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

746
00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:22.870
<v Speaker 2>it has to be announced so that you're happy if it happens,</v>

747
00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:24.160
<v Speaker 2>but not so little,</v>

748
00:39:24.161 --> 00:39:25.750
<v Speaker 2>but it's a trivial accomplishment.</v>

749
00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:27.400
<v Speaker 2>And then he kind of calibrated.</v>

750
00:39:27.401 --> 00:39:29.140
<v Speaker 2>It's like you know,</v>

751
00:39:29.141 --> 00:39:32.200
<v Speaker 2>you're not interested in playing a game that you can win every time.</v>

752
00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:33.430
<v Speaker 2>You're kind of a full,</v>

753
00:39:33.431 --> 00:39:37.180
<v Speaker 2>under no circumstances do you want to have a pretty decent shot at winning,</v>

754
00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:40.350
<v Speaker 2>but maybe that your skill improves while you're playing it,</v>

755
00:39:40.351 --> 00:39:42.460
<v Speaker 2>so that's what did you set yourself a task and think,</v>

756
00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:42.570
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

757
00:39:42.570 --> 00:39:43.870
<v Speaker 2>I can probably in this,</v>

758
00:39:43.871 --> 00:39:47.020
<v Speaker 2>it's a little bit outside of my zone of comfort.</v>

759
00:39:47.021 --> 00:39:49.810
<v Speaker 2>Let's say it's a little bit of white habitual practice,</v>

760
00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:52.300
<v Speaker 2>but I think I can do it tomorrow.</v>

761
00:39:52.301 --> 00:39:53.470
<v Speaker 2>I can do it for a week,</v>

762
00:39:53.830 --> 00:39:56.860
<v Speaker 2>and then if you can't do it while they lower your sights a little bit now,</v>

763
00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:57.701
<v Speaker 2>lower your sights,</v>

764
00:39:57.701 --> 00:40:00.100
<v Speaker 2>tell you a little better,</v>

765
00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:01.181
<v Speaker 2>then you think,</v>

766
00:40:01.181 --> 00:40:01.361
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

767
00:40:01.361 --> 00:40:02.440
<v Speaker 2>there's my zone.</v>

768
00:40:02.441 --> 00:40:04.600
<v Speaker 2>I can I can improve at this rate.</v>

769
00:40:05.350 --> 00:40:07.420
<v Speaker 2>You'll find that that's a meaningful place to be.</v>

770
00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:11.830
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't be at the place where you could improve a little bit constantly and</v>

771
00:40:11.831 --> 00:40:14.500
<v Speaker 2>you can find that experiment that takes humility,</v>

772
00:40:14.501 --> 00:40:15.280
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

773
00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:15.790
<v Speaker 2>Jennifer,</v>

774
00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:19.800
<v Speaker 2>because you're not as good at getting better as you think you.</v>
