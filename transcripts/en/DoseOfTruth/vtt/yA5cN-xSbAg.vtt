1
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.550
<v Speaker 1>Is there something,</v>

2
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.930
<v Speaker 1>this is the main question,</v>

3
00:00:09.931 --> 00:00:11.010
<v Speaker 1>is there something,</v>

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.400
<v Speaker 1>is there a set of ideas that Western civilization is predicated on that are more</v>

5
00:00:17.941 --> 00:00:19.680
<v Speaker 1>than just bloody opinion?</v>

6
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.390
<v Speaker 1>That's the question.</v>

7
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.490
<v Speaker 1>Because if there isn't,</v>

8
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:25.980
<v Speaker 1>well then what do you,</v>

9
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.970
<v Speaker 1>what do you do about that?</v>

10
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.290
<v Speaker 1>It's arbitrary.</v>

11
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.930
<v Speaker 1>You're just holding it for no reason whatsoever.</v>

12
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:32.850
<v Speaker 1>It could be a different system.</v>

13
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.650
<v Speaker 1>There's no reason to stick with it.</v>

14
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.610
<v Speaker 1>All of those things,</v>

15
00:00:35.611 --> 00:00:36.450
<v Speaker 1>like it takes the,</v>

16
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.220
<v Speaker 1>it takes the core out of it.</v>

17
00:00:38.221 --> 00:00:39.390
<v Speaker 1>When that was niches claim,</v>

18
00:00:39.391 --> 00:00:39.631
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

19
00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:44.631
<v Speaker 1>He said you take the core metaphysical presupposition out from underneath</v>

20
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.860
<v Speaker 1>Western civilization or any civilization for that matter and the whole thing</v>

21
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.950
<v Speaker 1>loosens shakings shakes and crumbles while for nature,</v>

22
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.720
<v Speaker 1>the metaphysical presupposition was God.</v>

23
00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:59.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

24
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.510
<v Speaker 1>and then the question of course,</v>

25
00:01:00.511 --> 00:01:01.960
<v Speaker 1>well what even does that mean?</v>

26
00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:05.250
<v Speaker 1>And it on one hand it means,</v>

27
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.610
<v Speaker 1>I suppose adherence to a dogmatic set of beliefs,</v>

28
00:01:08.611 --> 00:01:10.290
<v Speaker 1>but then you might ask yourself,</v>

29
00:01:10.291 --> 00:01:10.411
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

30
00:01:10.411 --> 00:01:12.690
<v Speaker 1>is there something else that it means?</v>

31
00:01:12.691 --> 00:01:16.530
<v Speaker 1>It means at least the hypothesis of some transcendent value.</v>

32
00:01:16.531 --> 00:01:17.880
<v Speaker 1>It means at least that.</v>

33
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

34
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:19.713
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

35
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.660
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

36
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.940
<v Speaker 1>Nietzsche announced the death of God.</v>

37
00:01:26.941 --> 00:01:30.690
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the consequences of that dusty Husky was working on exactly the</v>

38
00:01:30.691 --> 00:01:33.780
<v Speaker 1>same set of ideas and in crime and punishment in particular,</v>

39
00:01:33.781 --> 00:01:36.900
<v Speaker 1>which is a book could gets a necessary book.</v>

40
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.990
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing is there's a number of books that were written in the last</v>

41
00:01:39.991 --> 00:01:43.500
<v Speaker 1>hundred and 20 years that you really have to read and crime and punishment is</v>

42
00:01:43.501 --> 00:01:44.011
<v Speaker 1>one of them.</v>

43
00:01:44.011 --> 00:01:47.790
<v Speaker 1>And I think the Gulag archipelago is another and probably beyond good and evil</v>

44
00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:48.624
<v Speaker 1>is another.</v>

45
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.321
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

46
00:01:49.321 --> 00:01:51.480
<v Speaker 1>Dostoyevsky and Nichi we're writing in parallel.</v>

47
00:01:51.481 --> 00:01:53.430
<v Speaker 1>It's remarkable how much their,</v>

48
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.560
<v Speaker 1>their lives intertwined.</v>

49
00:01:55.561 --> 00:02:00.180
<v Speaker 1>And Nisha knew more about Dostoyevsky then that is generally don't,</v>

50
00:02:00.181 --> 00:02:02.490
<v Speaker 1>there's been some recent scholarship indicating that,</v>

51
00:02:02.491 --> 00:02:05.520
<v Speaker 1>but in Dostoyevsky's crime and punishment,</v>

52
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.923
<v Speaker 1>he has a,</v>

53
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.430
<v Speaker 1>his main character,</v>

54
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.990
<v Speaker 1>a risk call Nikolov decides that he's going to commit a murder and he has very</v>

55
00:02:12.991 --> 00:02:14.400
<v Speaker 1>good justification for the murder.</v>

56
00:02:14.401 --> 00:02:15.990
<v Speaker 1>And Dusty Yefsky is very good at this.</v>

57
00:02:15.991 --> 00:02:16.470
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

58
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.240
<v Speaker 1>he puts his characters into very,</v>

59
00:02:18.241 --> 00:02:23.241
<v Speaker 1>very difficult moral situations and gives them full justification for pursuing</v>

60
00:02:23.941 --> 00:02:24.774
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

61
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.291
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

62
00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:26.124
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

63
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.620
<v Speaker 1>pursuing the pathway that they're pursuing.</v>

64
00:02:38.621 --> 00:02:39.820
<v Speaker 1>And so risk golden cove,</v>

65
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.310
<v Speaker 1>he's broke and starving.</v>

66
00:02:42.311 --> 00:02:43.510
<v Speaker 1>He wants to go to law school.</v>

67
00:02:43.511 --> 00:02:45.610
<v Speaker 1>His sister's about to prostitute herself rough,</v>

68
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.421
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

69
00:02:46.421 --> 00:02:48.250
<v Speaker 1>by marrying a guy that hates her,</v>

70
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.300
<v Speaker 1>that she hates and that,</v>

71
00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:50.890
<v Speaker 1>and he has contempt for her,</v>

72
00:02:50.891 --> 00:02:52.180
<v Speaker 1>at least acts in that manner.</v>

73
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.070
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to rescue his mother as well,</v>

74
00:02:54.071 --> 00:02:56.110
<v Speaker 1>who's also in dire financial straits.</v>

75
00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:57.220
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

76
00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.820
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

77
00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.470
<v Speaker 1>he goes to a pawnbroker to pawn his meager position so that he can continue to</v>

78
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:03.700
<v Speaker 1>scrape by.</v>

79
00:03:03.701 --> 00:03:05.830
<v Speaker 1>And she has this nice,</v>

80
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.530
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's her niece that's not very bright,</v>

81
00:03:08.531 --> 00:03:09.890
<v Speaker 1>who she basically treats as an,</v>

82
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.680
<v Speaker 1>as a slave and his horrible too.</v>

83
00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:11.890
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

84
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.890
<v Speaker 1>and so the carrot that the pawnbroker has this money risk Niqab is in dire need.</v>

85
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.633
<v Speaker 1>He thinks,</v>

86
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:19.151
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

87
00:03:19.151 --> 00:03:22.330
<v Speaker 1>I'll just kill her because why the hell not?</v>

88
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.400
<v Speaker 1>I'll take her money.</v>

89
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.780
<v Speaker 1>She's not doing any good with it.</v>

90
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:26.410
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>

91
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.690
<v Speaker 1>I'll free your niece who's just working as a slave.</v>

92
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.650
<v Speaker 1>She's got all these other people tangled up in her pawnbroker schemes.</v>

93
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.350
<v Speaker 1>All that'll happen is the world will be a better place.</v>

94
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.540
<v Speaker 1>And the only thing that's holding me back is conventional moral cowardice.</v>

95
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.921
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

96
00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:46.921
<v Speaker 1>Dostoyevsky has his character in crime and punishment go through days,</v>

97
00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.630
<v Speaker 1>hours,</v>

98
00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.630
<v Speaker 1>hours and days and weeks of intense imagination about this rationalization,</v>

99
00:03:53.291 --> 00:03:54.124
<v Speaker 1>about this,</v>

100
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.140
<v Speaker 1>trying to justify himself,</v>

101
00:03:56.141 --> 00:03:57.550
<v Speaker 1>placing a metal outside,</v>

102
00:03:57.551 --> 00:04:02.320
<v Speaker 1>placing him self outside the law so that he can perpetrate this act and telling</v>

103
00:04:02.321 --> 00:04:06.580
<v Speaker 1>him self with all the best nihilistic arguments that the only possible thing</v>

104
00:04:06.581 --> 00:04:11.020
<v Speaker 1>that could be holding them back is an an arbitrary sense of indoctrinated</v>

105
00:04:11.021 --> 00:04:11.854
<v Speaker 1>morality.</v>

106
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.640
<v Speaker 1>And so dusty Esky explores that he does commit the murder and then of course all</v>

107
00:04:15.641 --> 00:04:18.640
<v Speaker 1>hell breaks loose because things don't necessarily turn out the way that you</v>

108
00:04:18.641 --> 00:04:18.850
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>

109
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:19.661
<v Speaker 1>He gets away with it.</v>

110
00:04:19.661 --> 00:04:20.494
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

111
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.290
<v Speaker 1>while he gets away with it technically because no one knows he did it,</v>

112
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.710
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't get away with it in relationship to his own conscience.</v>

113
00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.010
<v Speaker 1>And so that the rest of the book explores that.</v>

114
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.980
<v Speaker 1>Well Dostoyevsky I believe it was in crime and punishment.</v>

115
00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:35.680
<v Speaker 1>Although he makes the same point in many of his books.</v>

116
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.750
<v Speaker 1>He makes a very fundamental point,</v>

117
00:04:37.751 --> 00:04:41.830
<v Speaker 1>and this is the kind of point that that I think that people who haven't</v>

118
00:04:41.831 --> 00:04:45.740
<v Speaker 1>investigated these matters down this particularly lid,</v>

119
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.520
<v Speaker 1>particular literary and philosophical pathway,</v>

120
00:04:48.521 --> 00:04:53.260
<v Speaker 1>never grappled with dusty Esky said straightforwardly if there's no god.</v>

121
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:54.880
<v Speaker 1>So if there is no higher value,</v>

122
00:04:54.881 --> 00:04:56.410
<v Speaker 1>let's say if there's no transcendent value,</v>

123
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.750
<v Speaker 1>then you can do whatever you want.</v>

124
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.930
<v Speaker 1>And that's the question that he's investigating.</v>

125
00:05:01.931 --> 00:05:02.740
<v Speaker 1>And you see,</v>

126
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.400
<v Speaker 1>this is why I have such frustration say with people like Sam Harris,</v>

127
00:05:06.401 --> 00:05:07.780
<v Speaker 1>the sort of radical atheists,</v>

128
00:05:07.781 --> 00:05:11.950
<v Speaker 1>because they seem to think that once human beings abandoned their,</v>

129
00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.050
<v Speaker 1>their grounding in the transcendent,</v>

130
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:15.070
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>

131
00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.840
<v Speaker 1>the plausible way forward is with a kind of purest rationality that</v>

132
00:05:19.841 --> 00:05:23.140
<v Speaker 1>automatically attributes to other people equivalent value.</v>

133
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.220
<v Speaker 1>It's like I just don't understand that they believe that that's the rational</v>

134
00:05:27.221 --> 00:05:28.000
<v Speaker 1>pathway.</v>

135
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.840
<v Speaker 1>What the hell is irrational about me getting exactly what I want from every one</v>

136
00:05:31.841 --> 00:05:34.810
<v Speaker 1>of you whenever I want it at every possible second.</v>

137
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.990
<v Speaker 1>Why is that a irrational and how possibly is that more irrational than us</v>

138
00:05:41.561 --> 00:05:43.990
<v Speaker 1>cooperating so we can both have a good time of it?</v>

139
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:45.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand that.</v>

140
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:51.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's as if the psychopathic tendency is irrational.</v>

141
00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.990
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing irrational about it.</v>

142
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.090
<v Speaker 1>It's pure naked self interest.</v>

143
00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:56.440
<v Speaker 1>How is that irrational?</v>

144
00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand that.</v>

145
00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.750
<v Speaker 1>Where,</v>

146
00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.250
<v Speaker 1>where's the pathway from rationality to,</v>

147
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.550
<v Speaker 1>to an egalitarian virtue and why the hell not every man for himself and the</v>

148
00:06:06.591 --> 00:06:07.970
<v Speaker 1>devil take the hindmost.</v>

149
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.710
<v Speaker 1>It's a perfectly coherent philosophy and is actually one that you can institute</v>

150
00:06:12.711 --> 00:06:15.680
<v Speaker 1>in the world with a fair bit of material success if you want to do it.</v>

151
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.110
<v Speaker 1>So I don't see,</v>

152
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.681
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

153
00:06:18.681 --> 00:06:23.681
<v Speaker 1>I think that that the universe that people like Dorkins and Harris inhabit is so</v>

154
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.520
<v Speaker 1>intensely conditioned by mythological presuppositions that they take for granted</v>

155
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:37.010
<v Speaker 1>the they ethic that emerges out of that as if it's just a given,</v>

156
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:38.060
<v Speaker 1>a rational given.</v>

157
00:06:38.061 --> 00:06:40.160
<v Speaker 1>And this of course precisely not niches,</v>

158
00:06:40.161 --> 00:06:43.190
<v Speaker 1>observation as well as dusty huskies are snitches observation.</v>

159
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.480
<v Speaker 1>You don't get it.</v>

160
00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:49.810
<v Speaker 1>The ethic that you think is normative is a consequence of its of its rate of its</v>

161
00:06:50.061 --> 00:06:53.330
<v Speaker 1>nesting inside this tremendously lengthy history,</v>

162
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:56.870
<v Speaker 1>much of which was expressed in mythological formulation.</v>

163
00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.250
<v Speaker 1>You wipe that out.</v>

164
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.300
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to keep all the presuppositions and just assume that they're</v>

165
00:07:02.301 --> 00:07:04.100
<v Speaker 1>rationally axiomatic there.</v>

166
00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:05.420
<v Speaker 1>The rational,</v>

167
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.490
<v Speaker 1>to make a rational argument,</v>

168
00:07:07.491 --> 00:07:10.370
<v Speaker 1>you have to start with an initial proposition.</v>

169
00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:14.900
<v Speaker 1>While the proposition that underlies western culture is that there's a</v>

170
00:07:14.901 --> 00:07:16.580
<v Speaker 1>transcendent morality.</v>

171
00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:17.301
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

172
00:07:17.301 --> 00:07:21.110
<v Speaker 1>you could say that's a transcendent morality instantiated in the finger of God.</v>

173
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:21.741
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

174
00:07:21.741 --> 00:07:25.520
<v Speaker 1>You could even call that a personification of the morality if you want to,</v>

175
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.310
<v Speaker 1>if you don't want to move into a metaphysical space.</v>

176
00:07:28.311 --> 00:07:30.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm not arguing for the existence of God.</v>

177
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:36.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm arguing that the ethic that drives our culture is predicated on the idea of</v>

178
00:07:38.901 --> 00:07:43.610
<v Speaker 1>God and that you can't just take that idea away and expect the thing to remain</v>

179
00:07:43.611 --> 00:07:46.400
<v Speaker 1>intact midair without any foundational support.</v>

180
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:46.791
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

181
00:07:46.791 --> 00:07:47.930
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to buy that,</v>

182
00:07:47.931 --> 00:07:49.940
<v Speaker 1>but if you're interested in the idea,</v>

183
00:07:49.941 --> 00:07:53.350
<v Speaker 1>then you can read Nicha because that's what he was trying to sort out.</v>
