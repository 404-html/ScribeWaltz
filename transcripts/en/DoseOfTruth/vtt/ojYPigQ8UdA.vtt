1
00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:07.201
<v Speaker 1>It was a,</v>

2
00:00:07.201 --> 00:00:10.560
<v Speaker 1>it was about advancement and it was also about the claim that somehow they have</v>

3
00:00:10.561 --> 00:00:11.760
<v Speaker 1>like special expertise.</v>

4
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.470
<v Speaker 1>This is a special technical language.</v>

5
00:00:13.471 --> 00:00:14.460
<v Speaker 1>No one else can understand it.</v>

6
00:00:14.461 --> 00:00:15.420
<v Speaker 1>Only only weekend,</v>

7
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.590
<v Speaker 1>but what's absurd about it absolutely ludicrous is that these people,</v>

8
00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:19.820
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

9
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.820
<v Speaker 1>these American academics are imitating the contorted language of French at the</v>

10
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.420
<v Speaker 1>translations from the French.</v>

11
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:28.240
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

12
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.360
<v Speaker 1>When lack call is translated into,</v>

13
00:00:30.361 --> 00:00:31.440
<v Speaker 1>into English,</v>

14
00:00:31.441 --> 00:00:31.710
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

15
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.180
<v Speaker 1>There's a contortion there.</v>

16
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:33.690
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

17
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:33.961
<v Speaker 1>What he's,</v>

18
00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:34.191
<v Speaker 1>what he,</v>

19
00:00:34.191 --> 00:00:37.080
<v Speaker 1>what he was trying to do in French was to break up,</v>

20
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.291
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

21
00:00:37.291 --> 00:00:40.890
<v Speaker 1>The neo classical formulations that descended from Ross scene,</v>

22
00:00:40.891 --> 00:00:42.000
<v Speaker 1>there was something that was going on.</v>

23
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:44.370
<v Speaker 1>Those are sabotage of the French language going on.</v>

24
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.780
<v Speaker 1>There was necessary in France,</v>

25
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.340
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily in English.</v>

26
00:00:47.341 --> 00:00:50.510
<v Speaker 1>We have this long tradition of poetry going back to Judah,</v>

27
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.690
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare and Chaucer.</v>

28
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.230
<v Speaker 1>We have,</v>

29
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.910
<v Speaker 1>we have our own language.</v>

30
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.160
<v Speaker 1>We're far more vital than that than the French.</v>

31
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.650
<v Speaker 1>The French constrained their language all the time.</v>

32
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.840
<v Speaker 1>By my dear absurdity in the amateur is ism.</v>

33
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:03.350
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

34
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.050
<v Speaker 1>Of of American academics trying to imitate,</v>

35
00:01:07.051 --> 00:01:07.470
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

36
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.970
<v Speaker 1>A translation of lack hall when like doing something in France.</v>

37
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.080
<v Speaker 1>That is absolutely not necessary and indeed wrong to be doing in English,</v>

38
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.410
<v Speaker 1>but the other cynical abandonment,</v>

39
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.651
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

40
00:01:19.651 --> 00:01:20.930
<v Speaker 1>Of the great tradition of,</v>

41
00:01:20.931 --> 00:01:21.091
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

42
00:01:21.091 --> 00:01:21.271
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

43
00:01:21.271 --> 00:01:21.900
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

44
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.201
<v Speaker 1>of uh,</v>

45
00:01:22.201 --> 00:01:26.700
<v Speaker 1>of the English departments and I felt that the true radicalism was not about</v>

46
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.740
<v Speaker 1>adding on other departments.</v>

47
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.921
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

48
00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:31.170
<v Speaker 1>So we have African American studies and you know,</v>

49
00:01:31.171 --> 00:01:32.790
<v Speaker 1>end to end in women's studies and so on.</v>

50
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.510
<v Speaker 1>The true radicalism would we have been just to shatter the departmental</v>

51
00:01:36.511 --> 00:01:37.021
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

52
00:01:37.021 --> 00:01:37.950
<v Speaker 1>That's what I wanted.</v>

53
00:01:37.951 --> 00:01:41.100
<v Speaker 1>I feel that was the authentic revolutionary 1960 going to do.</v>

54
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.620
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

55
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.530
<v Speaker 1>Do I look to them to blend all the literature,</v>

56
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.340
<v Speaker 1>literature studies?</v>

57
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

58
00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.271
<v Speaker 1>It's all these together.</v>

59
00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:45.870
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

60
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.040
<v Speaker 1>Do have to make easier to make an interdisciplinary kind of organization,</v>

61
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

62
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.850
<v Speaker 1>a little bit closer to the British model where a person can pursue related</v>

63
00:01:53.851 --> 00:01:54.301
<v Speaker 1>subjects,</v>

64
00:01:54.301 --> 00:01:55.440
<v Speaker 1>overlapping subjects.</v>

65
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.081
<v Speaker 1>I did it,</v>

66
00:01:56.081 --> 00:01:56.330
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

67
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.560
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

68
00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.850
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

69
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.170
<v Speaker 1>this departmental models.</v>

70
00:01:58.171 --> 00:01:58.471
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

71
00:01:58.471 --> 00:01:59.030
<v Speaker 1>Are,</v>

72
00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.340
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>

73
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.260
<v Speaker 1>were to me totalitarian to begin with.</v>

74
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.441
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

75
00:02:01.441 --> 00:02:04.120
<v Speaker 1>Separating language into fiefdoms and,</v>

76
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.521
<v Speaker 1>and what,</v>

77
00:02:04.521 --> 00:02:06.570
<v Speaker 1>what does the to create English,</v>

78
00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.070
<v Speaker 1>WWE women's studies department.</v>

79
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.850
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

80
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:09.900
<v Speaker 1>I out of the air,</v>

81
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.940
<v Speaker 1>just snap your fingers and create women's studies.</v>

82
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.550
<v Speaker 1>The English department had taken a century to develop.</v>

83
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.821
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

84
00:02:14.821 --> 00:02:16.350
<v Speaker 1>The way it was a huge argument.</v>

85
00:02:16.351 --> 00:02:16.531
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

86
00:02:16.531 --> 00:02:17.060
<v Speaker 1>Within,</v>

87
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.650
<v Speaker 1>within it.</v>

88
00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:18.090
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

89
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.620
<v Speaker 1>And all of a sudden to create,</v>

90
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.921
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

91
00:02:19.921 --> 00:02:20.820
<v Speaker 1>It department,</v>

92
00:02:20.821 --> 00:02:22.840
<v Speaker 1>would they politicize agenda from the start?</v>

93
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:23.280
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

94
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.630
<v Speaker 1>by people without any training,</v>

95
00:02:24.631 --> 00:02:25.890
<v Speaker 1>whatever in that field.</v>

96
00:02:25.891 --> 00:02:26.130
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

97
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.790
<v Speaker 1>What should be the,</v>

98
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:27.960
<v Speaker 1>what should be the parameters of the field,</v>

99
00:02:27.961 --> 00:02:29.290
<v Speaker 1>which should be the requirements of their field.</v>

100
00:02:29.291 --> 00:02:30.750
<v Speaker 1>How about biology?</v>

101
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:31.110
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

102
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.520
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to be discussing gender,</v>

103
00:02:32.521 --> 00:02:34.650
<v Speaker 1>that should have been a number one requirement.</v>

104
00:02:34.651 --> 00:02:35.130
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

105
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.410
<v Speaker 1>As part of any women's studies department or program.</v>

106
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.250
<v Speaker 1>But no.</v>

107
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

108
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.810
<v Speaker 1>It was all hands off.</v>

109
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.950
<v Speaker 1>It was just the administrators want it to solve a public relations problem.</v>

110
00:02:43.951 --> 00:02:44.310
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

111
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.710
<v Speaker 1>They had a situation with very few women faculty.</v>

112
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.530
<v Speaker 1>Are you nationwide at a time when the women's movement had,</v>

113
00:02:49.531 --> 00:02:50.430
<v Speaker 1>had just started up,</v>

114
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.030
<v Speaker 1>the spotlight of attention was,</v>

115
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.913
<v Speaker 1>was on them.</v>

116
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.401
<v Speaker 1>They want,</v>

117
00:02:53.401 --> 00:02:54.870
<v Speaker 1>they needed women faculty fast.</v>

118
00:02:54.871 --> 00:02:57.600
<v Speaker 1>They needed the women's subject on the agenda fast.</v>

119
00:02:57.601 --> 00:02:57.870
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

120
00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:58.980
<v Speaker 1>So they just like Poof,</v>

121
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.150
<v Speaker 1>let there be women's studies.</v>

122
00:03:01.151 --> 00:03:01.451
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

123
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:03.430
<v Speaker 1>And now we'll just hire some women.</v>

124
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.110
<v Speaker 1>It usually from English departments and you know,</v>

125
00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:07.810
<v Speaker 1>he hit here and there and we'll just throw them together.</v>

126
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:08.930
<v Speaker 1>You invent it,</v>

127
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:09.850
<v Speaker 1>you say what it is.</v>

128
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.880
<v Speaker 1>So that's why women said he's got frozen at a certain point of the ideology of</v>

129
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.070
<v Speaker 1>the early 1970s I was already in revolt from it.</v>

130
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.460
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

131
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.870
<v Speaker 1>I was a precursor in terms of my endorsement of feminism before,</v>

132
00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.130
<v Speaker 1>before even now it was created.</v>

133
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.670
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

134
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.410
<v Speaker 1>But I couldn't,</v>

135
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.620
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

136
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.150
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't even have a conversation with any of these women.</v>

137
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.640
<v Speaker 1>They were hysterical about this subject of biology.</v>

138
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.470
<v Speaker 1>They knew nothing about hormones and I,</v>

139
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:33.021
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>

140
00:03:33.021 --> 00:03:35.020
<v Speaker 1>I w I probably got in fist fights over this.</v>

141
00:03:35.021 --> 00:03:35.261
<v Speaker 1>They went,</v>

142
00:03:35.261 --> 00:03:37.870
<v Speaker 1>people were so convinced that biology had nothing,</v>

143
00:03:37.871 --> 00:03:39.820
<v Speaker 1>whatever to do with gender differences.</v>

144
00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.410
<v Speaker 2>That also seems to me to be related to the postmodern emphasis on power.</v>

145
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.830
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

146
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:45.910
<v Speaker 2>Because there's a,</v>

147
00:03:45.911 --> 00:03:49.390
<v Speaker 2>there's something terrible under round going on there and that is an eye.</v>

148
00:03:49.391 --> 00:03:52.840
<v Speaker 2>I think this is the sort of thing that was reflected in the Soviet Union to in</v>

149
00:03:52.841 --> 00:03:53.080
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

150
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.350
<v Speaker 2>especially in the 20s when there was this idea of radical idea that you could</v>

151
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.150
<v Speaker 2>remake human beings entirely,</v>

152
00:03:58.151 --> 00:03:58.391
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

153
00:03:58.391 --> 00:04:00.160
<v Speaker 2>Because they had no essential nature.</v>

154
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.320
<v Speaker 2>And so if your fundamental hypothesis is that nothing exists except power,</v>

155
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:06.340
<v Speaker 2>and you believe that,</v>

156
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.620
<v Speaker 2>then that also gives you the right,</v>

157
00:04:08.621 --> 00:04:13.090
<v Speaker 2>in some sense to exercise your power at the creation of the kind of humanity</v>

158
00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:15.040
<v Speaker 2>that your utopian vision envisions.</v>

159
00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.640
<v Speaker 2>Then that has no that,</v>

160
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.950
<v Speaker 2>and that also seems to me to justify the postmodern insistence that everything</v>

161
00:04:20.951 --> 00:04:22.540
<v Speaker 2>is only a linguistic construct.</v>

162
00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:24.640
<v Speaker 2>It again goes down to the notion of power,</v>

163
00:04:24.641 --> 00:04:25.241
<v Speaker 2>which Dera,</v>

164
00:04:25.241 --> 00:04:27.790
<v Speaker 2>dawn's Sukkot and lockout or some bloody obsessed with.</v>

165
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.571
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

166
00:04:28.571 --> 00:04:30.650
<v Speaker 2>and it seems to me what they're trying to do is to,</v>

167
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.410
<v Speaker 2>to take all the potential power for the creation of human beings to themselves</v>

168
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.690
<v Speaker 2>without any bounding conditions whatsoever,</v>

169
00:04:37.691 --> 00:04:38.170
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

170
00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.010
<v Speaker 2>There's no history,</v>

171
00:04:39.011 --> 00:04:40.180
<v Speaker 2>there's no biology,</v>

172
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.350
<v Speaker 2>there's and,</v>

173
00:04:41.351 --> 00:04:44.950
<v Speaker 2>and everything is a fluid culture that can be manipulated at will.</v>

174
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.290
<v Speaker 2>And so I mean in,</v>

175
00:04:46.291 --> 00:04:46.901
<v Speaker 2>in Canada,</v>

176
00:04:46.901 --> 00:04:50.290
<v Speaker 2>there a terrible arguments right now about biological essentialism,</v>

177
00:04:50.291 --> 00:04:50.810
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>

178
00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.240
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that happened,</v>

179
00:04:52.241 --> 00:04:54.970
<v Speaker 2>which was something I objected to precisely a year ago,</v>

180
00:04:54.971 --> 00:04:59.230
<v Speaker 2>is that the social constructionist view of human identity has been built now</v>

181
00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:00.340
<v Speaker 2>under Canadian law.</v>

182
00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.690
<v Speaker 2>So there's an insistence that biological sex,</v>

183
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.310
<v Speaker 2>gender identity,</v>

184
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.450
<v Speaker 2>gender expression,</v>

185
00:05:07.451 --> 00:05:12.130
<v Speaker 2>and sexual proclivity very independently with no causal relationship between any</v>

186
00:05:12.131 --> 00:05:12.964
<v Speaker 2>of the levels.</v>

187
00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.230
<v Speaker 2>And so that's in the law.</v>

188
00:05:14.231 --> 00:05:15.490
<v Speaker 2>And not only is it in the law,</v>

189
00:05:15.491 --> 00:05:16.720
<v Speaker 2>it's being taught everywhere.</v>

190
00:05:16.721 --> 00:05:18.100
<v Speaker 2>It's being taught in the armed forces,</v>

191
00:05:18.101 --> 00:05:19.300
<v Speaker 2>it's being taught in the police.</v>

192
00:05:19.301 --> 00:05:22.930
<v Speaker 2>It's being taught to the elementary school kids and the junior high school kids.</v>

193
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:24.250
<v Speaker 2>And underneath it all,</v>

194
00:05:24.251 --> 00:05:28.810
<v Speaker 2>I see this terrible striving for arbitrary power that's associated with this</v>

195
00:05:28.811 --> 00:05:30.310
<v Speaker 2>crazy utopianism and,</v>

196
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:31.110
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

197
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.660
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

198
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.520
<v Speaker 2>but I still don't exactly understand it.</v>

199
00:05:33.521 --> 00:05:34.241
<v Speaker 2>I don't like,</v>

200
00:05:34.241 --> 00:05:35.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand that.</v>

201
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.870
<v Speaker 2>What seems to be the hatred that motivates it,</v>

202
00:05:37.871 --> 00:05:39.190
<v Speaker 2>that you see bubbling up,</v>

203
00:05:39.191 --> 00:05:39.791
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

204
00:05:39.791 --> 00:05:41.170
<v Speaker 2>in identity politics and,</v>

205
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.280
<v Speaker 2>and in the desire to do nothing but let's say demolish the patriarchy.</v>
