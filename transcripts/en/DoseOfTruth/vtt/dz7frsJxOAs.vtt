1
00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.350
<v Speaker 1>So I guess the case that I was making last time,</v>

2
00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:04.250
<v Speaker 1>at least in part,</v>

3
00:00:04.251 --> 00:00:05.084
<v Speaker 1>was that</v>

4
00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:11.530
<v Speaker 1>you're one of one way of conceptualizing the fundamental problem that human</v>

5
00:00:12.921 --> 00:00:13.611
<v Speaker 1>beings face,</v>

6
00:00:13.611 --> 00:00:18.611
<v Speaker 1>is to conceptualize it as an ongoing struggle with complexity and</v>

7
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:23.910
<v Speaker 1>complexity</v>

8
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.170
<v Speaker 1>emerges as a consequence of</v>

9
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.150
<v Speaker 1>the sort of finite boundedness of individual consciousness.</v>

10
00:00:35.151 --> 00:00:35.984
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

11
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.290
<v Speaker 1>it incredible excess of the unbounded every way are everywhere else even</v>

12
00:00:44.701 --> 00:00:46.470
<v Speaker 1>including underneath that consciousness.</v>

13
00:00:46.471 --> 00:00:51.060
<v Speaker 1>Because of course your individual consciousness depends on the function or is</v>

14
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.400
<v Speaker 1>related to the function of things that are so complex.</v>

15
00:00:53.401 --> 00:00:54.690
<v Speaker 1>You can't even understand it.</v>

16
00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.200
<v Speaker 1>So there you are surrounded by some things that you understand in an,</v>

17
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.410
<v Speaker 1>in an ocean of things that you don't understand at all and including things</v>

18
00:01:04.411 --> 00:01:05.244
<v Speaker 1>about yourself.</v>

19
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.240
<v Speaker 1>And it's not obvious at all how people solve that problem because in some sense</v>

20
00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:12.450
<v Speaker 1>it's not solvable.</v>

21
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.400
<v Speaker 1>The fact that you don't have the cognitive resources or the conceptual resources</v>

22
00:01:17.401 --> 00:01:20.850
<v Speaker 1>to understand everything that you need to understand in order to properly orient</v>

23
00:01:20.851 --> 00:01:21.840
<v Speaker 1>yourself in the world.</v>

24
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.700
<v Speaker 1>Now obviously,</v>

25
00:01:23.701 --> 00:01:27.210
<v Speaker 1>partly the way we deal with that is that we cooperate with other people and so</v>

26
00:01:27.211 --> 00:01:31.620
<v Speaker 1>that radically multiplies our resources and credibly multiplies our resources.</v>

27
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.023
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

28
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:34.503
<v Speaker 1>and it's all,</v>

29
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.350
<v Speaker 1>it's something to consider always when,</v>

30
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.560
<v Speaker 1>so much of the political dialog that surrounds us now consists of a critique of,</v>

31
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.360
<v Speaker 1>of cooperative societies and uh,</v>

32
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.300
<v Speaker 1>an analysis of their oppressive nature.</v>

33
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.530
<v Speaker 1>Of course that's true because any cooperative system,</v>

34
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.980
<v Speaker 1>it specifies a certain endpoint and produces a value hierarchy of some sort.</v>

35
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.810
<v Speaker 1>Also simultaneously forces things into that value system.</v>

36
00:02:03.811 --> 00:02:04.830
<v Speaker 1>And then rank orders,</v>

37
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.390
<v Speaker 1>people according to the value structure and so there's an oppressive element to</v>

38
00:02:09.391 --> 00:02:09.630
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

39
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.340
<v Speaker 1>but compared to being naked in chaos,</v>

40
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.660
<v Speaker 1>generally it's better now.</v>

41
00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:20.790
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't always have to be because it can get murderous.</v>

42
00:02:20.791 --> 00:02:21.840
<v Speaker 1>But generally speaking,</v>

43
00:02:21.841 --> 00:02:22.350
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>

44
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.270
<v Speaker 1>we're social animals.</v>

45
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.123
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

46
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.440
<v Speaker 1>Our evolutionary pathway has already taken us here and so we're individuals,</v>

47
00:02:28.441 --> 00:02:32.760
<v Speaker 1>but we're unbelievably social and so that's that.</v>

48
00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.230
<v Speaker 1>So as far as I can tell,</v>

49
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.590
<v Speaker 1>we'd have to be completely different creatures not to fall,</v>

50
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.690
<v Speaker 1>not to take advantage of and fall prey to the problems with social being.</v>

51
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.860
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

52
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:44.693
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

53
00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.130
<v Speaker 1>I think the way that the problem of complexity has been solved,</v>

54
00:02:53.171 --> 00:02:58.120
<v Speaker 1>and this is the best argument I know of for the truth of the Darwinian notion of</v>

55
00:02:58.121 --> 00:02:59.590
<v Speaker 1>evolution now,</v>

56
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that our models of evolution are complete by any stretch of the</v>

57
00:03:03.551 --> 00:03:04.384
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>

58
00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:05.680
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>

59
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.210
<v Speaker 1>I know they're not partly because of recent work done in epigenetics,</v>

60
00:03:10.211 --> 00:03:12.640
<v Speaker 1>which suggests that you can acquire,</v>

61
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.380
<v Speaker 1>you can inherit acquired traits.</v>

62
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.461
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

63
00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:17.110
<v Speaker 1>And when I went to university,</v>

64
00:03:17.111 --> 00:03:19.060
<v Speaker 1>when I started going to university in the 19 eighties,</v>

65
00:03:19.061 --> 00:03:21.160
<v Speaker 1>that was heresy really.</v>

66
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.023
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

67
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.840
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

68
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.600
<v Speaker 1>you cannot inherit acquired traits,</v>

69
00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:28.060
<v Speaker 1>but actually you can inherit acquired traits.</v>

70
00:03:28.061 --> 00:03:29.780
<v Speaker 1>That's the field of epigenetic studies.</v>

71
00:03:29.781 --> 00:03:31.150
<v Speaker 1>That and that.</v>

72
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.890
<v Speaker 1>That's a radical shift in perspective because we also don't know exactly what</v>

73
00:03:35.891 --> 00:03:37.600
<v Speaker 1>that means across any length of time.</v>

74
00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:39.940
<v Speaker 1>And when you're thinking about evolutionary lengths of time,</v>

75
00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:43.060
<v Speaker 1>you're thinking about three and a half billion years because that's the span of</v>

76
00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:44.440
<v Speaker 1>time over which life evolved.</v>

77
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.440
<v Speaker 1>And so even things that don't have a overwhelmingly market potency for one</v>

78
00:03:52.301 --> 00:03:55.180
<v Speaker 1>generation can be unbelievably powerful across time.</v>

79
00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.090
<v Speaker 1>And then there's also the issue of sexual sexual selection because you know,</v>

80
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.630
<v Speaker 1>you'll hear darwinist continually described the world and the evolutionary world</v>

81
00:04:04.631 --> 00:04:09.220
<v Speaker 1>as a place of randomness and that's not true and I don't know why they make that</v>

82
00:04:09.221 --> 00:04:10.054
<v Speaker 1>statement.</v>

83
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.910
<v Speaker 1>The mutations are random or quasi random because we don't understand mutations</v>

84
00:04:15.911 --> 00:04:16.721
<v Speaker 1>that well yet either.</v>

85
00:04:16.721 --> 00:04:18.220
<v Speaker 1>And most mutations are deadly,</v>

86
00:04:18.221 --> 00:04:18.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

87
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:19.990
<v Speaker 1>Most mutations are deadly.</v>

88
00:04:19.991 --> 00:04:22.600
<v Speaker 1>There's a set of them that are harmful but not deadly.</v>

89
00:04:22.601 --> 00:04:23.500
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a tiny,</v>

90
00:04:23.501 --> 00:04:28.501
<v Speaker 1>tiny proportion that could in principle produced some benefit to the next</v>

91
00:04:28.961 --> 00:04:32.820
<v Speaker 1>generation assuming environmental environmental shift,</v>

92
00:04:32.821 --> 00:04:34.450
<v Speaker 1>say in the direction of the mutation.</v>

93
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:35.763
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

94
00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.641
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

95
00:04:36.641 --> 00:04:38.110
<v Speaker 1>there's a randomness element to that.</v>

96
00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:38.681
<v Speaker 1>We know that,</v>

97
00:04:38.681 --> 00:04:38.921
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

98
00:04:38.921 --> 00:04:43.921
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason that you mutate or your cells mutate your DNA mutates is</v>

99
00:04:43.991 --> 00:04:47.320
<v Speaker 1>because of background levels of radioactivity.</v>

100
00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.200
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of that's a consequence of solar activity,</v>

101
00:04:50.201 --> 00:04:50.441
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

102
00:04:50.441 --> 00:04:54.160
<v Speaker 1>So cosmic rays come zipping through the atmosphere and they nail your DNA and</v>

103
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.070
<v Speaker 1>produce minor alterations and that's a mutation.</v>

104
00:04:57.071 --> 00:04:59.560
<v Speaker 1>And if you crank up the background radiation rate,</v>

105
00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:00.850
<v Speaker 1>like say around Chernobyl,</v>

106
00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.650
<v Speaker 1>then the mutation rate rises.</v>

107
00:05:02.651 --> 00:05:07.300
<v Speaker 1>And there's definitely a random element to that and it's necessary for there to</v>

108
00:05:07.301 --> 00:05:10.660
<v Speaker 1>be a random element because as far as I can tell,</v>

109
00:05:10.661 --> 00:05:15.130
<v Speaker 1>the only way you can beat a random environment is by producing random changes.</v>

110
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.671
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

111
00:05:15.671 --> 00:05:17.440
<v Speaker 1>So you know the idea,</v>

112
00:05:17.441 --> 00:05:18.330
<v Speaker 1>basically the,</v>

113
00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.050
<v Speaker 1>the environment isn't some static place that's selecting for higher and higher</v>

114
00:05:23.051 --> 00:05:25.300
<v Speaker 1>levels of fitness or not in any,</v>

115
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:26.343
<v Speaker 1>not in any.</v>

116
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.690
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly not doing that in any static way.</v>

117
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.280
<v Speaker 1>And so it's shifting around randomly and then you know,</v>

118
00:05:33.281 --> 00:05:36.670
<v Speaker 1>you have a structure that's been your species has a structure that's a</v>

119
00:05:36.671 --> 00:05:40.720
<v Speaker 1>consequence of this immense evolutionary journey and it's moderating itself</v>

120
00:05:40.721 --> 00:05:42.640
<v Speaker 1>randomly within certain parameters.</v>

121
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.220
<v Speaker 1>The parameters being that most mutations will kill you,</v>

122
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.310
<v Speaker 1>like alterations in your fundamental form generally tend to kill you.</v>

123
00:05:48.311 --> 00:05:52.930
<v Speaker 1>So they're incremental and so the mutations are random and they match.</v>

124
00:05:52.931 --> 00:05:56.530
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully they ratchet the randomness in the environmental shift and so you can</v>

125
00:05:56.531 --> 00:05:57.860
<v Speaker 1>more or less up that way,</v>

126
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.700
<v Speaker 1>but then there's additional complicating factors and they're not trivial.</v>

127
00:06:01.701 --> 00:06:03.680
<v Speaker 1>And one of them is whatever epigenetics does.</v>

128
00:06:03.681 --> 00:06:05.090
<v Speaker 1>We don't know anything about that yet.</v>

129
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.220
<v Speaker 1>But the second one is sexual selection.</v>

130
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.860
<v Speaker 1>And sexual selection is no joke.</v>

131
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.640
<v Speaker 1>It could be the primary thing is certainly one of the primary things that's</v>

132
00:06:13.641 --> 00:06:15.860
<v Speaker 1>driven human evolution and I think you can say that</v>

133
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:21.410
<v Speaker 1>you think about the environment.</v>

134
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:22.280
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

135
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.630
<v Speaker 1>let's think about the environment.</v>

136
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.740
<v Speaker 1>So you have a dominance hierarchy and that's really old structure.</v>

137
00:06:27.741 --> 00:06:32.210
<v Speaker 1>The dominance hierarchy is 300 million years old because it emerged pretty much</v>

138
00:06:32.211 --> 00:06:33.080
<v Speaker 1>whenever there was.</v>

139
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.700
<v Speaker 1>Whenever there was a nervous system,</v>

140
00:06:34.701 --> 00:06:36.680
<v Speaker 1>emergent nervous system and whatever.</v>

141
00:06:36.681 --> 00:06:38.570
<v Speaker 1>Animals had to occupy the same territory.</v>

142
00:06:38.571 --> 00:06:41.900
<v Speaker 1>They automatically organized themselves into something approximating a dominance</v>

143
00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:42.231
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>

144
00:06:42.231 --> 00:06:43.520
<v Speaker 1>So it's a very,</v>

145
00:06:43.521 --> 00:06:43.911
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

146
00:06:43.911 --> 00:06:44.301
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

147
00:06:44.301 --> 00:06:45.560
<v Speaker 1>very old structure.</v>

148
00:06:45.561 --> 00:06:46.880
<v Speaker 1>It's older than trees.</v>

149
00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.560
<v Speaker 1>It's older than flowers,</v>

150
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:49.910
<v Speaker 1>it's old.</v>

151
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.200
<v Speaker 1>And as far as real goes from a Darwinian sense,</v>

152
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.330
<v Speaker 1>permanent is real.</v>

153
00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.020
<v Speaker 1>And so when you,</v>

154
00:06:58.021 --> 00:06:58.461
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>

155
00:06:58.461 --> 00:06:58.731
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

156
00:06:58.731 --> 00:06:59.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

157
00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:04.060
<v Speaker 1>arboreal ancestors adapted themselves to trees and so the tree was a long around</v>

158
00:07:04.761 --> 00:07:07.010
<v Speaker 1>long enough to be a feature of the environment.</v>

159
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.460
<v Speaker 1>But the dominance hierarchy has been around a lot longer than trees.</v>

160
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.150
<v Speaker 1>And you can think of the dominance hierarchy both as an adaptation to the</v>

161
00:07:14.151 --> 00:07:14.930
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>

162
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.200
<v Speaker 1>because you'd kind of think about the dominant Turkey has a cultural construct,</v>

163
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.400
<v Speaker 1>but if a cultural construct lasts long enough that it becomes part of the</v>

164
00:07:22.401 --> 00:07:26.180
<v Speaker 1>environment and so the dominant Turkey's part of the environment and what seems</v>

165
00:07:26.181 --> 00:07:28.220
<v Speaker 1>to happen roughly speaking,</v>

166
00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.590
<v Speaker 1>and this is an oversimplification but we'll go with it,</v>

167
00:07:30.591 --> 00:07:35.591
<v Speaker 1>is that males have a dominance hierarchy and there's a relatively small number</v>

168
00:07:37.161 --> 00:07:41.420
<v Speaker 1>of males that are relatively successful and those successful males have</v>

169
00:07:41.421 --> 00:07:46.421
<v Speaker 1>preferential access to female reproductive capacity either because the females</v>

170
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.520
<v Speaker 1>actively choose the the more dominant males,</v>

171
00:07:49.521 --> 00:07:50.181
<v Speaker 1>which is very,</v>

172
00:07:50.181 --> 00:07:55.070
<v Speaker 1>very common or because the more dominant males chase all the less dominant males</v>

173
00:07:55.071 --> 00:07:58.790
<v Speaker 1>away so that even if the females don't exercise choice,</v>

174
00:07:58.791 --> 00:07:59.840
<v Speaker 1>which they often do,</v>

175
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:05.050
<v Speaker 1>then the only males left around that can serve as reasonable.</v>

176
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:08.090
<v Speaker 1>Mating partners are the more powerful ones.</v>

177
00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:13.220
<v Speaker 1>And so you think you got to really radical determiners of evolution as a</v>

178
00:08:13.221 --> 00:08:14.450
<v Speaker 1>consequence of that one.</v>

179
00:08:14.451 --> 00:08:16.730
<v Speaker 1>Is that each.</v>

180
00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:20.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about female dominance hierarchies at the moment,</v>

181
00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:21.770
<v Speaker 1>but I can talk about that,</v>

182
00:08:21.771 --> 00:08:23.780
<v Speaker 1>but that's why this is oversimplification,</v>

183
00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:28.700
<v Speaker 1>but what happens is that the males obviously are selected for their ability to</v>

184
00:08:28.701 --> 00:08:32.450
<v Speaker 1>move up dominance hierarchies obviously because the ones that are at the top of</v>

185
00:08:32.451 --> 00:08:36.500
<v Speaker 1>the dominance hierarchy reproduce preferentially and so that means the male</v>

186
00:08:36.501 --> 00:08:39.890
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy becomes a method of selection,</v>

187
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:45.130
<v Speaker 1>but then allied with that is the female proclivity for choice on whatever</v>

188
00:08:45.981 --> 00:08:49.730
<v Speaker 1>dimension the dominance hierarchy happens to be arranged and so then female</v>

189
00:08:49.731 --> 00:08:54.731
<v Speaker 1>sexual selection also becomes a radical nonrandom selector of,</v>

190
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:57.780
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

191
00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:58.740
<v Speaker 1>of what,</v>

192
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.560
<v Speaker 1>what genetic material is going to move into the next generation.</v>

193
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:02.633
<v Speaker 1>And so I,</v>

194
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:07.410
<v Speaker 1>I failed to see how any of that can be separated from the emergence of complex</v>

195
00:09:07.411 --> 00:09:11.190
<v Speaker 1>nervous systems and mind over the course of evolution because people are.</v>

196
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.590
<v Speaker 1>Creatures aren't making random choices.</v>

197
00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:15.120
<v Speaker 1>They're not random at all.</v>

198
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:20.810
<v Speaker 1>So we even know such things like imagine a peacock's tail,</v>

199
00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:22.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

200
00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.190
<v Speaker 1>it's covered with ice,</v>

201
00:09:23.191 --> 00:09:26.370
<v Speaker 1>which is quite interesting because eyes of course attract attention and lots of</v>

202
00:09:26.371 --> 00:09:27.300
<v Speaker 1>animals have evolved.</v>

203
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.500
<v Speaker 1>I liked markets like moss.</v>

204
00:09:29.501 --> 00:09:31.440
<v Speaker 1>There's moss that when they unfold their wings,</v>

205
00:09:31.441 --> 00:09:34.230
<v Speaker 1>they have two big eyes on the back of them and that's to keep birds from eating</v>

206
00:09:34.231 --> 00:09:34.561
<v Speaker 1>them right?</v>

207
00:09:34.561 --> 00:09:36.360
<v Speaker 1>Because the birds don't like being stared at,</v>

208
00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:37.800
<v Speaker 1>so they stay away from the moths.</v>

209
00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.390
<v Speaker 1>But so a peacock's tail,</v>

210
00:09:39.391 --> 00:09:43.290
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing but eyes and so it's very attractive and it shimmers and there's</v>

211
00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:44.520
<v Speaker 1>something about it that's beautiful,</v>

212
00:09:44.521 --> 00:09:45.960
<v Speaker 1>which is quite interesting to.</v>

213
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:50.190
<v Speaker 1>The females have obviously been selecting the male peacock peacocks for beauty.</v>

214
00:09:50.191 --> 00:09:53.370
<v Speaker 1>They have this insane tail while so they,</v>

215
00:09:53.371 --> 00:09:54.840
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary biologists have thought,</v>

216
00:09:54.841 --> 00:09:55.140
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

217
00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:57.900
<v Speaker 1>what possible utility could that tail be?</v>

218
00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:01.020
<v Speaker 1>Is it just maybe the females got fixated on tail,</v>

219
00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:01.831
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

220
00:10:01.831 --> 00:10:03.040
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

221
00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:07.110
<v Speaker 1>you've got a Baldwin infect loop going there and the male peacocks just got</v>

222
00:10:07.111 --> 00:10:09.780
<v Speaker 1>bigger and bigger tales and it's just like an evolutionary dead end.</v>

223
00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:10.020
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

224
00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:10.291
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

225
00:10:10.291 --> 00:10:13.320
<v Speaker 1>it's a positive feedback system that's gone out of control,</v>

226
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:17.480
<v Speaker 1>but they have done things that like look at the cemetery and,</v>

227
00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:18.230
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

228
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:19.440
<v Speaker 1>and breadth say,</v>

229
00:10:19.441 --> 00:10:24.441
<v Speaker 1>or the symmetry and size and overall quality of the male peacock's tail as a</v>

230
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:26.220
<v Speaker 1>marker for physical health.</v>

231
00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:28.440
<v Speaker 1>So reduce parasite load for example.</v>

232
00:10:28.441 --> 00:10:32.070
<v Speaker 1>And it does turn out that the healthier male peacocks have better tail display.</v>

233
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:36.540
<v Speaker 1>And so the way what the females seem to be doing is using some marker or some</v>

234
00:10:36.541 --> 00:10:39.750
<v Speaker 1>set of markers as a proxy indicator for,</v>

235
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:40.973
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

236
00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:41.843
<v Speaker 1>for health.</v>

237
00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:44.970
<v Speaker 1>And I think I think you could say with,</v>

238
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:46.200
<v Speaker 1>with reasonable,</v>

239
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:50.790
<v Speaker 1>you could say reasonable that reasonably that female human beings do the same</v>

240
00:10:50.791 --> 00:10:51.930
<v Speaker 1>thing to male human beings.</v>

241
00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:54.030
<v Speaker 1>And there's some of that vice versa too.</v>

242
00:10:54.031 --> 00:10:55.140
<v Speaker 1>Like we evaluate each other,</v>

243
00:10:55.141 --> 00:10:55.711
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

244
00:10:55.711 --> 00:10:56.371
<v Speaker 1>for symmetry,</v>

245
00:10:56.371 --> 00:11:00.000
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the elements of beauty because healthier people tend to be more</v>

246
00:11:00.001 --> 00:11:02.520
<v Speaker 1>symmetrical and lots of animals use symmetry.</v>

247
00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:03.443
<v Speaker 1>Butterflies,</v>

248
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:07.470
<v Speaker 1>butterflies won't mate with another butterfly if it deviates from cemetery by</v>

249
00:11:07.471 --> 00:11:09.240
<v Speaker 1>the tiniest amounts you can imagine.</v>

250
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:10.800
<v Speaker 1>So symmetry is a marker.</v>

251
00:11:10.801 --> 00:11:15.560
<v Speaker 1>And there's other markers like shoulder width to waist width is one,</v>

252
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:17.520
<v Speaker 1>and waist to hip width is another.</v>

253
00:11:17.521 --> 00:11:18.810
<v Speaker 1>That's usually what mail is.</v>

254
00:11:18.811 --> 00:11:20.670
<v Speaker 1>Use that to evaluate females in part.</v>

255
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:22.500
<v Speaker 1>So there's lots of markers of health.</v>

256
00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:28.740
<v Speaker 1>But it also looks to me like the data worldwide seems to indicate that women.</v>

257
00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:32.610
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that women May to cross dominance,</v>

258
00:11:32.611 --> 00:11:35.140
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies end up socioeconomically speaking,</v>

259
00:11:35.141 --> 00:11:36.810
<v Speaker 1>and on average across cultures,</v>

260
00:11:36.811 --> 00:11:39.180
<v Speaker 1>women go for men who were about four to five years older,</v>

261
00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:39.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

262
00:11:39.511 --> 00:11:41.550
<v Speaker 1>it varies in the Scandinavian countries,</v>

263
00:11:41.551 --> 00:11:42.600
<v Speaker 1>that's shrunk a little bit,</v>

264
00:11:42.601 --> 00:11:43.620
<v Speaker 1>but not that much.</v>

265
00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:45.360
<v Speaker 1>And in other cultures it's bigger.</v>

266
00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:49.350
<v Speaker 1>I would say that depends to some degree on difficulty of establishing economic</v>

267
00:11:49.351 --> 00:11:50.184
<v Speaker 1>independence,</v>

268
00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:50.731
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

269
00:11:50.731 --> 00:11:53.860
<v Speaker 1>Because in richer countries it's easier to have enough economic independence if</v>

270
00:11:53.861 --> 00:11:55.150
<v Speaker 1>you're a male to be,</v>

271
00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:59.290
<v Speaker 1>to be a useful participant in the process of having children.</v>

272
00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:00.573
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

273
00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:01.810
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter.</v>

274
00:12:01.811 --> 00:12:02.561
<v Speaker 1>Cross culturally,</v>

275
00:12:02.561 --> 00:12:05.320
<v Speaker 1>it's still across the nop were manmade across and down.</v>

276
00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:07.660
<v Speaker 1>They don't care much about socioeconomic status.</v>

277
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:10.420
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't seem to be part of their selection method.</v>

278
00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:11.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

279
00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.370
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking.</v>
