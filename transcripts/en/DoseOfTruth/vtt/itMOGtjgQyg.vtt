1
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.540
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that one of the things that drives the collectivist ethos,</v>

2
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.560
<v Speaker 1>which is often formulated in terms of compassion for the oppressed,</v>

3
00:00:16.561 --> 00:00:19.050
<v Speaker 1>which is something we'll talk about a little bit later,</v>

4
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.370
<v Speaker 1>is actually a deep desire to at all costs,</v>

5
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.800
<v Speaker 1>avoid that responsibility.</v>

6
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.930
<v Speaker 1>And it's no wonder because the responsibility is overwhelming.</v>

7
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.710
<v Speaker 1>Say The world fundamentally is a tragic place,</v>

8
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.671
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

9
00:00:35.671 --> 00:00:40.671
<v Speaker 1>It's a place in which each of us is broken and it's contaminated by the ever</v>

10
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.430
<v Speaker 1>present reality of betrayal and malevolence and to shoulder the responsibility</v>

11
00:00:47.731 --> 00:00:50.010
<v Speaker 1>first for even admitting to that.</v>

12
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.670
<v Speaker 1>And second for assuming that you are duty bound,</v>

13
00:00:56.011 --> 00:00:56.844
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

14
00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.620
<v Speaker 1>to do something about that.</v>

15
00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:59.041
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

16
00:00:59.041 --> 00:01:04.041
<v Speaker 1>that's a task that anyone who has his or her eyes open should be leery of</v>

17
00:01:04.321 --> 00:01:05.154
<v Speaker 1>accepting.</v>

18
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.210
<v Speaker 1>And I would say,</v>

19
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:07.261
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

20
00:01:07.261 --> 00:01:11.820
<v Speaker 1>perhaps there's no credible reason for accepting it except that every other</v>

21
00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:13.290
<v Speaker 1>alternative is worse.</v>

22
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.870
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

23
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.940
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a brutal fact.</v>

24
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.460
<v Speaker 1>So the antidote to collectivism is individualism,</v>

25
00:01:22.461 --> 00:01:27.461
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the individualism of the privileged person with rights.</v>

26
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.550
<v Speaker 1>It's the terrible burden of the individual who determines that he or she will</v>

27
00:01:33.831 --> 00:01:37.280
<v Speaker 1>shoulder their responsibility to that most.</v>

28
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.340
<v Speaker 1>So I developed that idea in maps of meaning</v>

29
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:45.590
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

30
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.990
<v Speaker 1>and I made a lot of lectures about that book,</v>

31
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.180
<v Speaker 1>many of which are on Youtube,</v>

32
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.200
<v Speaker 1>some of which have become widely viewed,</v>

33
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.080
<v Speaker 1>I would say by a hundreds of thousands of people now.</v>

34
00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.620
<v Speaker 1>And so that and that course always had a dramatic effect on my students and</v>

35
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.970
<v Speaker 1>their most typical comment.</v>

36
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.430
<v Speaker 1>There's two classes of typical comments.</v>

37
00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.660
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

38
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.340
<v Speaker 1>That I got from students about my maps of meaning courses,</v>

39
00:02:11.341 --> 00:02:11.521
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

40
00:02:11.521 --> 00:02:14.540
<v Speaker 1>It's the same comments that I get from people now when they come and talk to me</v>

41
00:02:14.541 --> 00:02:15.380
<v Speaker 1>about my lectures.</v>

42
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.240
<v Speaker 1>The first comment is,</v>

43
00:02:17.241 --> 00:02:19.760
<v Speaker 1>and this is about maybe a quarter of the people,</v>

44
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.923
<v Speaker 1>is that</v>

45
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.230
<v Speaker 1>watching the lectures are taking the course,</v>

46
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.500
<v Speaker 1>enabled them to put words to things they knew,</v>

47
00:02:28.501 --> 00:02:30.450
<v Speaker 1>they knew but didn't know how to say.</v>

48
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.011
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

49
00:02:32.011 --> 00:02:35.820
<v Speaker 1>and that's fine because that was an ex that was actually an explicit purpose of</v>

50
00:02:35.821 --> 00:02:36.870
<v Speaker 1>the writing and the course.</v>

51
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.110
<v Speaker 1>And the second is that it helped people straightened out their lives.</v>

52
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.240
<v Speaker 1>And that's also not that surprising to me because a lot of what I integrated</v>

53
00:02:45.241 --> 00:02:50.241
<v Speaker 1>into that book and the lectures and then the lectures were also associated with</v>

54
00:02:50.371 --> 00:02:55.371
<v Speaker 1>my personality course were ideas from the great clinical psychologists and</v>

55
00:02:55.561 --> 00:02:57.690
<v Speaker 1>psychiatrists of the 20th century.</v>

56
00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.440
<v Speaker 1>It was a dozen of them or so,</v>

57
00:02:59.441 --> 00:03:02.950
<v Speaker 1>or maybe 20 who were all outstanding geniuses,</v>

58
00:03:02.951 --> 00:03:07.951
<v Speaker 1>have slightly different types who learned all sorts of things about how people</v>

59
00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:11.650
<v Speaker 1>could put them self together properly as individuals.</v>

60
00:03:11.651 --> 00:03:13.390
<v Speaker 1>And if you learn about those things,</v>

61
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.100
<v Speaker 1>they're actually really helpful.</v>

62
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.900
<v Speaker 1>That's not surprising because they sit at the core of an entire domain of</v>

63
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:21.820
<v Speaker 1>science and art,</v>

64
00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:22.301
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

65
00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:24.820
<v Speaker 1>devoted to improving people's individual lives.</v>

66
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.740
<v Speaker 1>I wove the responsibility idea into 12 rules cause that's really what it is.</v>

67
00:03:34.541 --> 00:03:35.351
<v Speaker 1>In some sense.</v>

68
00:03:35.351 --> 00:03:40.351
<v Speaker 1>It's a call to the voluntary adoption of maximal individual responsibility and</v>

69
00:03:43.331 --> 00:03:44.710
<v Speaker 1>it's a psychological work,</v>

70
00:03:44.711 --> 00:03:45.790
<v Speaker 1>not a political work.</v>

71
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.820
<v Speaker 1>Now I think the reason that it's attracted so much political attention,</v>

72
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.020
<v Speaker 1>let's say some of which gun lager referred to in the introduction is,</v>

73
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:57.041
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

74
00:03:57.041 --> 00:03:57.761
<v Speaker 1>there's two reasons.</v>

75
00:03:57.761 --> 00:04:01.750
<v Speaker 1>One is because I took what might be regarded as a political stance about some</v>

76
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.330
<v Speaker 1>compelled speech legislation in Canada.</v>

77
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.950
<v Speaker 1>I never regarded that as a political move because I regarded the legislation</v>

78
00:04:08.951 --> 00:04:11.560
<v Speaker 1>itself as something that wasn't a political move.</v>

79
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:17.350
<v Speaker 1>I regarded it as an attempt by the politicians to jump outside their domain of</v>

80
00:04:17.351 --> 00:04:22.180
<v Speaker 1>acceptable conduct into the philosophical or even the theological realm because</v>

81
00:04:22.181 --> 00:04:27.181
<v Speaker 1>you don't mess with the idea of free speech in a Western country.</v>

82
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.370
<v Speaker 1>And there's very sophisticated reasons for that.</v>

83
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.640
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't matter what your reasons for doing it are.</v>

84
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.860
<v Speaker 1>You don't go there.</v>

85
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.880
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

86
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.770
<v Speaker 1>but it happened to be the more radical leftists that were pushing this forward.</v>

87
00:04:41.771 --> 00:04:43.180
<v Speaker 1>And because I objected to it,</v>

88
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.920
<v Speaker 1>then it was in their interest to assume that I must be the worst sort of right</v>

89
00:04:47.921 --> 00:04:48.720
<v Speaker 1>wing.</v>

90
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

91
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.040
<v Speaker 1>die hard I suppose,</v>

92
00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:55.810
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise they'd have to contend with my actual arguments.</v>

93
00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.550
<v Speaker 1>And so it's simpler just to shoot the messenger than to contend with the</v>

94
00:05:00.551 --> 00:05:01.384
<v Speaker 1>arguments.</v>

95
00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.901
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

96
00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:06.670
<v Speaker 1>if you stand up and say there's something wrong in a place like Canada where</v>

97
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:07.930
<v Speaker 1>most things aren't wrong,</v>

98
00:05:07.931 --> 00:05:11.350
<v Speaker 1>then it's reasonable also for people to assume there must be something wrong</v>

99
00:05:11.351 --> 00:05:14.650
<v Speaker 1>with you because most of the time there isn't anything wrong with the country</v>

100
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.970
<v Speaker 1>and so a certain amount of testing is a reasonable thing for people to do.</v>

101
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.410
<v Speaker 1>I guess the other element of this that's political in some sense though,</v>

102
00:05:25.411 --> 00:05:28.110
<v Speaker 1>is that within the collectivist viewpoint,</v>

103
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.170
<v Speaker 1>this is something that's very interesting with regard to free speech.</v>

104
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.600
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really figure this out until a couple of weeks ago.</v>

105
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.030
<v Speaker 1>Although the radical leftists,</v>

106
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.340
<v Speaker 1>and you see this particularly in the United States now,</v>

107
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.360
<v Speaker 1>although the Americans have a very strong tradition of free speech,</v>

108
00:05:42.361 --> 00:05:46.200
<v Speaker 1>the radical leftists are opposed to freedom of speech,</v>

109
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.550
<v Speaker 1>but that's not really right.</v>

110
00:05:47.551 --> 00:05:48.570
<v Speaker 1>It's not the way to think about it.</v>

111
00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.470
<v Speaker 1>In the radical leftist collectivist view of the world,</v>

112
00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.110
<v Speaker 1>there's actually no such thing as free speech.</v>

113
00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:57.770
<v Speaker 1>It said worst then,</v>

114
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.980
<v Speaker 1>then opposing it because the collectivists believe that you're nothing but an</v>

115
00:06:03.381 --> 00:06:04.790
<v Speaker 1>Avatar of your group.</v>

116
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:05.421
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

117
00:06:05.421 --> 00:06:06.470
<v Speaker 1>there is no you.</v>

118
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.750
<v Speaker 1>You're defined by your group membership.</v>

119
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:14.170
<v Speaker 1>And then the world is a landscape of groups each vying for predominance.</v>

120
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.090
<v Speaker 1>And that's what there is.</v>

121
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:17.923
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

122
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.410
<v Speaker 1>and so when you say that you're speaking your mind,</v>

123
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.400
<v Speaker 1>that isn't something that you can do from the collectivist viewpoint.</v>

124
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:30.820
<v Speaker 1>What you're doing is acting as an unconscious Avatar of the power demands of</v>

125
00:06:31.251 --> 00:06:32.084
<v Speaker 1>your group.</v>

126
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.350
<v Speaker 1>There's no you,</v>

127
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:34.820
<v Speaker 1>there was no free speech.</v>

128
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:36.230
<v Speaker 1>There's no your opinion.</v>

129
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.210
<v Speaker 1>There's no facts for that matter.</v>

130
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:43.540
<v Speaker 1>Everything is to be viewed in relationship to the power struggle between groups</v>

131
00:06:43.941 --> 00:06:46.400
<v Speaker 1>that even in principle cannot communicate.</v>

132
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.060
<v Speaker 1>And so the other reason that I detest,</v>

133
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:55.270
<v Speaker 1>let's say the collectivist viewpoint is because I see that it leads nowhere but</v>

134
00:06:56.691 --> 00:06:57.524
<v Speaker 1>to conflict.</v>

135
00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:02.890
<v Speaker 1>Because if people cannot speak as individuals between groups,</v>

136
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.980
<v Speaker 1>then all they can do is submit or fight.</v>

137
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:08.780
<v Speaker 1>Those are the options,</v>

138
00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.913
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

139
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:11.480
<v Speaker 1>Negotiation,</v>

140
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.420
<v Speaker 1>capitulation or warfare.</v>

141
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.430
<v Speaker 1>Those are the options.</v>

142
00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:17.840
<v Speaker 1>And the only</v>

143
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:24.460
<v Speaker 1>process that allows for negotiation in the absence of capitulation or conflict</v>

144
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:26.630
<v Speaker 1>is speech.</v>

145
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:31.310
<v Speaker 1>Because we can talk over our differences and that discussion is going to be</v>

146
00:07:31.311 --> 00:07:34.730
<v Speaker 1>contentious because we actually have differences.</v>

147
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.470
<v Speaker 1>But compared to the contentiousness of not talking over the differences,</v>

148
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:41.180
<v Speaker 1>it's a walk in the park.</v>

149
00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.020
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

150
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:46.220
<v Speaker 1>I saw something quite remarkable that when I was in London a month and a half</v>

151
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:46.730
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

152
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:50.870
<v Speaker 1>I was on this political show and one of the things they did in this section that</v>

153
00:07:50.871 --> 00:07:55.871
<v Speaker 1>didn't have anything to do with me was to show a bunch of clips from the,</v>

154
00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:57.110
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

155
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:57.710
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

156
00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:02.570
<v Speaker 1>there's a question period that the British have evolved where the opposition can</v>

157
00:08:02.571 --> 00:08:04.100
<v Speaker 1>go after the prime minister.</v>

158
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:08.750
<v Speaker 1>And the woman that was appearing with me on the show had written a book about</v>

159
00:08:08.751 --> 00:08:10.520
<v Speaker 1>that called Punch and Judy,</v>

160
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:12.050
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>

161
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:17.290
<v Speaker 1>and they showed a bunch of clips of English mps attacking the prime minister and</v>

162
00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:21.050
<v Speaker 1>the prime minister's response all the way from Thatcher forward.</v>

163
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.380
<v Speaker 1>It was absolutely vicious in the way that,</v>

164
00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:26.780
<v Speaker 1>well educated British people can be vicious,</v>

165
00:08:26.781 --> 00:08:29.300
<v Speaker 1>which is very impressive form of viciousness.</v>

166
00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:30.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

167
00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:30.450
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

168
00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:33.740
<v Speaker 1>it was no holds barred verbal combat.</v>

169
00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:34.761
<v Speaker 1>And you might think,</v>

170
00:08:34.761 --> 00:08:35.540
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

171
00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:36.680
<v Speaker 1>isn't that horrible?</v>

172
00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:38.330
<v Speaker 1>Because it's certainly rife,</v>

173
00:08:38.331 --> 00:08:40.400
<v Speaker 1>let's say with micro aggressions,</v>

174
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:45.080
<v Speaker 1>but it's not horrible because none of them had their hands around each other's</v>

175
00:08:45.081 --> 00:08:45.914
<v Speaker 1>necks,</v>

176
00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:46.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

177
00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:48.080
<v Speaker 1>It was all civilized.</v>

178
00:08:48.081 --> 00:08:51.110
<v Speaker 1>It was everyone was standing where they were supposed to stand and they were</v>

179
00:08:51.111 --> 00:08:55.770
<v Speaker 1>hurling invective and making criticisms and making accusations and defending</v>

180
00:08:55.771 --> 00:08:56.880
<v Speaker 1>themselves and all of that.</v>

181
00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:02.150
<v Speaker 1>But it was all contained within the peaceful confines of this,</v>

182
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.230
<v Speaker 1>of the house of parliament.</v>

183
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.970
<v Speaker 1>And that's our miracle,</v>

184
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:06.990
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

185
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:07.920
<v Speaker 1>It's a miracle.</v>

186
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:10.380
<v Speaker 1>And the British are particularly good at that.</v>

187
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:15.690
<v Speaker 1>And so you leave free speech alone because the alternative to free speeches,</v>

188
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.150
<v Speaker 1>capitulation or conflict,</v>

189
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.970
<v Speaker 1>and unless you want one of those or both,</v>

190
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.350
<v Speaker 1>and you might,</v>

191
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:27.090
<v Speaker 1>then you don't interfere with the mechanism that enables people's people to</v>

192
00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:31.530
<v Speaker 1>state the nature of their reality and to clarify that and to negotiate with</v>

193
00:09:31.531 --> 00:09:32.070
<v Speaker 1>others,</v>

194
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:35.400
<v Speaker 1>even though that negotiation is painful and emotionally demanding and</v>

195
00:09:35.401 --> 00:09:40.401
<v Speaker 1>threatening and anxiety provoking and aggression instigating and all of those</v>

196
00:09:41.551 --> 00:09:42.000
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

197
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.920
<v Speaker 1>because the alternative is far worse.</v>
