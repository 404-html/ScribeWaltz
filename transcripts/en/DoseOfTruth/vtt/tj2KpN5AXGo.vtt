1
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.770
<v Speaker 1>I lose my ability to think straight or intelligently and confrontational or</v>

2
00:00:10.771 --> 00:00:12.930
<v Speaker 1>unfriendly social situations.</v>

3
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.140
<v Speaker 1>Any suggestions for adoptation or approvement?</v>

4
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.380
<v Speaker 1>a couple I suppose.</v>

6
00:00:19.381 --> 00:00:19.811
<v Speaker 1>One is,</v>

7
00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:24.150
<v Speaker 1>is that when you get nervous in this Hannah's situation that you're describing,</v>

8
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.380
<v Speaker 1>what often happens to people as they start paying attention to themselves,</v>

9
00:00:28.381 --> 00:00:29.460
<v Speaker 1>they get self conscious.</v>

10
00:00:29.461 --> 00:00:31.110
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

11
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.040
<v Speaker 1>let's say I got self conscious all of a sudden during this Q and a,</v>

12
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.510
<v Speaker 1>what would happen is that I'd stopped paying attention to the questions and the</v>

13
00:00:39.511 --> 00:00:44.160
<v Speaker 1>screen and what I'm doing and I'd start paying attention to how I was feeling</v>

14
00:00:44.161 --> 00:00:45.450
<v Speaker 1>and to the nervousness.</v>

15
00:00:45.451 --> 00:00:49.980
<v Speaker 1>And then I'd start to get aware that I was not responding properly and that</v>

16
00:00:49.981 --> 00:00:51.330
<v Speaker 1>would make me more nervous.</v>

17
00:00:51.331 --> 00:00:55.440
<v Speaker 1>And then I would get more aware of that and that can just shut me down entirely.</v>

18
00:00:55.441 --> 00:00:56.580
<v Speaker 1>And that's happened to me now.</v>

19
00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.270
<v Speaker 1>And then in a lecture and sometimes almost happened when I was talking to Sam</v>

20
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.103
<v Speaker 1>Harris the first time.</v>

21
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.393
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

22
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.910
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

23
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.820
<v Speaker 1>I paused for a long time and then became aware of the pause.</v>

24
00:01:05.821 --> 00:01:06.870
<v Speaker 1>And then anyways,</v>

25
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.700
<v Speaker 1>what you have to do in a situation like that is it's not so much that you have</v>

26
00:01:11.701 --> 00:01:16.260
<v Speaker 1>to stop attending to yourself because if you start thinking I should stop</v>

27
00:01:16.261 --> 00:01:17.610
<v Speaker 1>attending to myself,</v>

28
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.860
<v Speaker 1>then you'll just think about yourself more.</v>

29
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.100
<v Speaker 1>What you have to do instead is pay more attention to this situation and to the</v>

30
00:01:26.641 --> 00:01:27.810
<v Speaker 1>people that you're talking to.</v>

31
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.990
<v Speaker 1>So you have to increase the degree to which you're at attending outwardly and</v>

32
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.630
<v Speaker 1>that'll stop you from attending inwardly.</v>

33
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.163
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

34
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.640
<v Speaker 1>that's very effective technique.</v>

35
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.750
<v Speaker 1>You can practice that.</v>

36
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:43.770
<v Speaker 1>Generally speaking,</v>

37
00:01:43.771 --> 00:01:44.730
<v Speaker 1>every time you get nervous,</v>

38
00:01:44.731 --> 00:01:48.090
<v Speaker 1>start paying more attention and that'll,</v>

39
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.373
<v Speaker 1>that'll,</v>

40
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.670
<v Speaker 1>that'll help you out a lot.</v>

41
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

42
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:52.090
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

43
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.090
<v Speaker 1>the really good suggestion for social anxiety in general is that if you see most</v>

44
00:01:58.051 --> 00:01:58.560
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

45
00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.340
<v Speaker 1>but not everyone,</v>

46
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.840
<v Speaker 1>but most people have enough implicit social skill because they were reasonably</v>

47
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.090
<v Speaker 1>socialized when they were children so that they do know how to act in social</v>

48
00:02:09.091 --> 00:02:09.691
<v Speaker 1>situations,</v>

49
00:02:09.691 --> 00:02:13.740
<v Speaker 1>but they get anxious and then that interferes with them implementing what they</v>

50
00:02:13.741 --> 00:02:13.980
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

51
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.300
<v Speaker 1>Just like if you're a pianist and you get anxious and self conscious while</v>

52
00:02:18.301 --> 00:02:18.841
<v Speaker 1>you're playing,</v>

53
00:02:18.841 --> 00:02:20.550
<v Speaker 1>you'll forget what you know.</v>

54
00:02:20.551 --> 00:02:23.370
<v Speaker 1>Because while you've activated a different part of your brain,</v>

55
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.770
<v Speaker 1>if you can remember to pay attention and you can direct your attention outward</v>

56
00:02:28.771 --> 00:02:30.000
<v Speaker 1>and you attend hard enough,</v>

57
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.200
<v Speaker 1>then what will happen?</v>

58
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.590
<v Speaker 1>And try to put the other person at ease and try to ask them questions,</v>

59
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.860
<v Speaker 1>then that'll kick in the automatic because you're paying attention to what the</v>

60
00:02:40.591 --> 00:02:44.190
<v Speaker 1>person is doing and to their facial expressions and all of that,</v>

61
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.710
<v Speaker 1>that will clue in the automatic and implicit,</v>

62
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

63
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.120
<v Speaker 1>knowledge that you have and make things much more smooth and,</v>

64
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:55.051
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

65
00:02:55.051 --> 00:02:55.884
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

66
00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.410
<v Speaker 1>and anxiety free.</v>

67
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.590
<v Speaker 1>So attention really attention really plays a huge role in regulating anxiety.</v>
