1
00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:03.670
<v Speaker 1>I'll turn to the story.</v>

2
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.270
<v Speaker 1>So the first problem,</v>

3
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.021
<v Speaker 1>as I mentioned,</v>

4
00:00:07.021 --> 00:00:08.850
<v Speaker 1>is a complexity problem.</v>

5
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.670
<v Speaker 1>Things are just too complicated to get a handle on and that actually has serious</v>

6
00:00:14.671 --> 00:00:18.480
<v Speaker 1>consequences because what happens to everyone eventually is that their lives</v>

7
00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:20.190
<v Speaker 1>become so complicated that they die.</v>

8
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.290
<v Speaker 1>So and that and that and many terrible things can happen to you on the way to</v>

9
00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:29.430
<v Speaker 1>dying as well that are complex complexity related,</v>

10
00:00:29.431 --> 00:00:29.731
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

11
00:00:29.731 --> 00:00:32.220
<v Speaker 1>You can develop a serious illness that you can't get a handle on.</v>

12
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.330
<v Speaker 1>You can hit a,</v>

13
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.223
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

14
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.820
<v Speaker 1>what would you call an impasse in your relationship that you cannot get past and</v>

15
00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:39.121
<v Speaker 1>see?</v>

16
00:00:39.121 --> 00:00:41.820
<v Speaker 1>No way out of that happens to people quite frequently.</v>

17
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.290
<v Speaker 1>People who are suicidal,</v>

18
00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:43.891
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

19
00:00:43.891 --> 00:00:46.290
<v Speaker 1>they often feel like they've been backed into a corner,</v>

20
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.780
<v Speaker 1>that they have no options,</v>

21
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:49.800
<v Speaker 1>they have no good options,</v>

22
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.180
<v Speaker 1>no matter which way they turn.</v>

23
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.510
<v Speaker 1>There's something terrible to face and they can't see any way out of it.</v>

24
00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.110
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes that's more true than you'd like to think because we also tend to</v>

25
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.750
<v Speaker 1>like to think that people's problems are primarily psychological,</v>

26
00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:05.020
<v Speaker 1>but they're not not.</v>

27
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.000
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing you learned quite rapidly as a clinician is that most of the</v>

28
00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:11.250
<v Speaker 1>time people don't come to you because they have mental illness.</v>

29
00:01:11.251 --> 00:01:13.920
<v Speaker 1>They come to you because they have a complexity management problem.</v>

30
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.390
<v Speaker 1>Their lives have got out of hand on them and they don't know how to get them</v>

31
00:01:18.391 --> 00:01:19.560
<v Speaker 1>back under control.</v>

32
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.200
<v Speaker 1>And so all sorts of things can do that.</v>

33
00:01:22.201 --> 00:01:24.320
<v Speaker 1>And then of course that can make you anxious or depressed.</v>

34
00:01:24.321 --> 00:01:25.860
<v Speaker 1>It can trigger all sorts of illnesses,</v>

35
00:01:25.861 --> 00:01:30.861
<v Speaker 1>but the fundamental problem is still that things have got beyond you and that</v>

36
00:01:31.321 --> 00:01:35.130
<v Speaker 1>actually has a psychophysiological costs that isn't merely psychological.</v>

37
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.910
<v Speaker 1>You have a limited amount of capacity from,</v>

38
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:39.300
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

39
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.900
<v Speaker 1>from a resource perspective to deal with emergent complexity.</v>

40
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.981
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>

41
00:01:43.981 --> 00:01:45.180
<v Speaker 1>it's just not enough of you.</v>

42
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.043
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>

43
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.711
<v Speaker 1>you'll,</v>

44
00:01:46.711 --> 00:01:51.711
<v Speaker 1>you'll exhaust your psychophysiological resources if you get into a situation</v>

45
00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:53.100
<v Speaker 1>that's too complex.</v>

46
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.030
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what this,</v>

47
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.110
<v Speaker 1>that's what the idea of chaos represents.</v>

48
00:01:58.111 --> 00:02:01.770
<v Speaker 1>It represents that underlying complexity that can manifest itself at any time.</v>

49
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.360
<v Speaker 1>And it can manifest itself.</v>

50
00:02:03.361 --> 00:02:03.931
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

51
00:02:03.931 --> 00:02:04.764
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

52
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.600
<v Speaker 1>if you wake up in the morning and you know,</v>

53
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.760
<v Speaker 1>you feel an ache of some sort and perhaps it's nothing and you ignore it,</v>

54
00:02:11.761 --> 00:02:16.020
<v Speaker 1>but it gets worse and you end up going to the hospital and you find out perhaps</v>

55
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.131
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

56
00:02:17.131 --> 00:02:20.100
<v Speaker 1>that you have pancreatic cancer and you're going to live for six months.</v>

57
00:02:20.101 --> 00:02:21.270
<v Speaker 1>And that's the end of that.</v>

58
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:22.590
<v Speaker 1>And so it's,</v>

59
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:23.370
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

60
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.940
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

61
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.750
<v Speaker 1>it's at that moment that you break through the thin ice that everyone walks on</v>

62
00:02:27.751 --> 00:02:31.740
<v Speaker 1>and you see what's underneath and what's underneath is the ineradicable</v>

63
00:02:31.741 --> 00:02:33.240
<v Speaker 1>complexity of life.</v>

64
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.130
<v Speaker 1>And that's chaos.</v>

65
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.640
<v Speaker 1>That's now it's taken people a long,</v>

66
00:02:38.641 --> 00:02:43.641
<v Speaker 1>long time to get a grip on this conceptuals,</v>

67
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:45.451
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>

68
00:02:45.451 --> 00:02:46.710
<v Speaker 1>Conceptual Schema.</v>

69
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.870
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

70
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.950
<v Speaker 1>and human beings have done it mostly with image and story before they've been</v>

71
00:02:52.951 --> 00:02:54.990
<v Speaker 1>able to do it in any articulated manner.</v>

72
00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 1>And so there are a set of images that represent this underlying chaos.</v>

73
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.680
<v Speaker 1>And one of them is the dragon of chaos that,</v>

74
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:03.670
<v Speaker 1>that precisely,</v>

75
00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.910
<v Speaker 1>that that's the dragon that the hero goes out to confront.</v>

76
00:03:06.911 --> 00:03:08.350
<v Speaker 1>That's the symbol of the unknown.</v>

77
00:03:08.351 --> 00:03:10.000
<v Speaker 1>It's the thing that lurks underneath.</v>

78
00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:13.240
<v Speaker 1>It's the thing that also guards treasured because in the unknown there's</v>

79
00:03:13.241 --> 00:03:15.290
<v Speaker 1>possibility also the,</v>

80
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.920
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

81
00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.890
<v Speaker 1>the water that was there,</v>

82
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.170
<v Speaker 1>we talked about in the Mesopotamian creation myth,</v>

83
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.330
<v Speaker 1>the water that's there at the beginning,</v>

84
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.470
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

85
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.450
<v Speaker 1>both the salt and the fresh water is often a symbol of pre cosmo,</v>

86
00:03:27.451 --> 00:03:28.330
<v Speaker 1>Garnett chaos.</v>

87
00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:29.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

88
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.550
<v Speaker 1>often people have dreams.</v>

89
00:03:30.551 --> 00:03:31.300
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

90
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.400
<v Speaker 1>some of you have had this dream,</v>

91
00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.890
<v Speaker 1>I suspect you'll dream that you're in a house that you know well,</v>

92
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.850
<v Speaker 1>and all of a sudden you discover a new room or a set of new rooms or maybe a set</v>

93
00:03:39.851 --> 00:03:41.830
<v Speaker 1>of rooms in the basement and often the rooms are,</v>

94
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.420
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

95
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.950
<v Speaker 1>are not well organized and they're full of water.</v>

96
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.450
<v Speaker 1>Those are very common things.</v>

97
00:03:46.451 --> 00:03:51.040
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that you've broken through the constraints of your</v>

98
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.840
<v Speaker 1>conscious self understanding to a new domain of,</v>

99
00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.090
<v Speaker 1>of possibility,</v>

100
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.790
<v Speaker 1>but a new domain that needs a tremendous amount of work.</v>

101
00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:01.211
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>

102
00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:01.331
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

103
00:04:01.331 --> 00:04:02.320
<v Speaker 1>here's the new part of you,</v>

104
00:04:02.321 --> 00:04:04.090
<v Speaker 1>but it's not well developed.</v>

105
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.650
<v Speaker 1>Theirs,</v>

106
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:05.110
<v Speaker 1>theirs,</v>

107
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.943
<v Speaker 1>it's flooded.</v>

108
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.930
<v Speaker 1>It's flooded with chaos essentially.</v>

109
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:09.280
<v Speaker 1>And it's water.</v>

110
00:04:09.281 --> 00:04:14.281
<v Speaker 1>I think partly because chaos is not only what you fall into when you're not</v>

111
00:04:14.441 --> 00:04:15.101
<v Speaker 1>expecting it,</v>

112
00:04:15.101 --> 00:04:19.210
<v Speaker 1>but it's also the unknown that you confront forthrightly and generate new things</v>

113
00:04:19.211 --> 00:04:19.571
<v Speaker 1>out of.</v>

114
00:04:19.571 --> 00:04:21.040
<v Speaker 1>And water is a symbol of life,</v>

115
00:04:21.041 --> 00:04:22.170
<v Speaker 1>especially in the desert.</v>

116
00:04:22.171 --> 00:04:22.721
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>

117
00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:24.820
<v Speaker 1>water life is dependent on water,</v>

118
00:04:24.821 --> 00:04:29.821
<v Speaker 1>and so water's a natural symbol to utilize when you're talking about something</v>

119
00:04:31.631 --> 00:04:32.441
<v Speaker 1>that's life giving,</v>

120
00:04:32.441 --> 00:04:33.970
<v Speaker 1>but also potentially deadly,</v>

121
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.350
<v Speaker 1>cause a little bit of water.</v>

122
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.281
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a drink,</v>

123
00:04:36.281 --> 00:04:37.091
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of water,</v>

124
00:04:37.091 --> 00:04:37.990
<v Speaker 1>that's a shipwreck.</v>
