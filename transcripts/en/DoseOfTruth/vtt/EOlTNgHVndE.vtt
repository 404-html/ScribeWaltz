1
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:09.190
<v Speaker 1>God says to Rachel,</v>

2
00:00:09.191 --> 00:00:10.630
<v Speaker 1>two nations are in Di womb,</v>

3
00:00:10.631 --> 00:00:14.230
<v Speaker 1>and two manner of people shall be separated from night bowels and one people</v>

4
00:00:14.231 --> 00:00:15.550
<v Speaker 1>shall be stronger than the other,</v>

5
00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.800
<v Speaker 1>and the elder shall serve the younger,</v>

6
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.290
<v Speaker 1>and so there's a inversion there,</v>

7
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.591
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

8
00:00:20.591 --> 00:00:23.680
<v Speaker 1>Because as we've discussed</v>

9
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.730
<v Speaker 1>historically speaking in traditionally speaking,</v>

10
00:00:27.731 --> 00:00:32.731
<v Speaker 1>it's the elder son that to whom the disproportionate blessings flow.</v>

11
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.610
<v Speaker 1>There's some truth in that too.</v>

12
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.040
<v Speaker 1>Even more.</v>

13
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.680
<v Speaker 1>What would you say more empirically?</v>

14
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.810
<v Speaker 1>Iq tends to decrease as the number of children in the family increase the</v>

15
00:00:46.811 --> 00:00:47.380
<v Speaker 1>younger.</v>

16
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.790
<v Speaker 1>The oldest is the smartest.</v>

17
00:00:48.791 --> 00:00:49.810
<v Speaker 1>Generally speaking,</v>

18
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.430
<v Speaker 1>it isn't clear why that is,</v>

19
00:00:51.431 --> 00:00:54.670
<v Speaker 1>but it might be that they get more attention and who knows?</v>

20
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.390
<v Speaker 1>So those of you who are younger can be very unhappy about that fact.</v>

21
00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:01.480
<v Speaker 1>Now Jacob.</v>

22
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:02.231
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

23
00:01:02.231 --> 00:01:03.130
<v Speaker 1>so there's another,</v>

24
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.640
<v Speaker 1>there's another plot line here too,</v>

25
00:01:06.641 --> 00:01:11.641
<v Speaker 1>because I'm a Abraham and and Rebecca</v>

26
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:14.980
<v Speaker 1>are at odds.</v>

27
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.711
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

28
00:01:15.711 --> 00:01:16.001
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

29
00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:19.240
<v Speaker 1>Isaac and Rebecca are at odds about the children.</v>

30
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.811
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

31
00:01:19.811 --> 00:01:20.644
<v Speaker 1>So there's a,</v>

32
00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.920
<v Speaker 1>there's an eda pole twist to it too because.</v>

33
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

34
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.200
<v Speaker 1>Isaac is allied with Esau who turns out to be the hunter type.</v>

35
00:01:29.201 --> 00:01:32.560
<v Speaker 1>So he's your basic rough and tumble character,</v>

36
00:01:32.561 --> 00:01:32.771
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

37
00:01:32.771 --> 00:01:37.210
<v Speaker 1>when he's kind of a wild looking guy called Harry and he likes to be outside.</v>

38
00:01:37.211 --> 00:01:37.990
<v Speaker 1>He lives in tents,</v>

39
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.741
<v Speaker 1>he likes to hunt.</v>

40
00:01:38.741 --> 00:01:40.090
<v Speaker 1>He's a man's man.</v>

41
00:01:40.091 --> 00:01:41.380
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>

42
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.770
<v Speaker 1>Whereas Jacob dwells intense,</v>

43
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:44.051
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:01:44.051 --> 00:01:45.160
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't go outside much.</v>

45
00:01:45.161 --> 00:01:46.060
<v Speaker 1>He's more,</v>

46
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.890
<v Speaker 1>well maybe he's more introverted,</v>

47
00:01:47.891 --> 00:01:52.891
<v Speaker 1>but he's certainly the sort of kid adolescent say who hangs around home and</v>

48
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.540
<v Speaker 1>there's some intimation that he's as,</v>

49
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.860
<v Speaker 1>while he's clearly as mother's favorite and with all the advantages and I</v>

50
00:01:59.861 --> 00:02:02.170
<v Speaker 1>suppose disadvantaged that go along with that.</v>

51
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.500
<v Speaker 1>And Isaac and Rebecca don't see Iti about who should have predominance among the</v>

52
00:02:09.131 --> 00:02:09.551
<v Speaker 1>sons.</v>

53
00:02:09.551 --> 00:02:14.551
<v Speaker 1>And Rebecca is quite complicit with Jacob in inverting the social order.</v>

54
00:02:18.161 --> 00:02:23.161
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing that happens that's crooked is that Esau comes in from</v>

55
00:02:25.421 --> 00:02:26.290
<v Speaker 1>hunting and he's,</v>

56
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

57
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.520
<v Speaker 1>he's been out for a number of days and he's ravenous and he's kind of an</v>

58
00:02:30.521 --> 00:02:31.360
<v Speaker 1>impulsive guy,</v>

59
00:02:31.361 --> 00:02:34.630
<v Speaker 1>doesn't really seem to think about the longterm very much.</v>

60
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.930
<v Speaker 1>And Jacob was cooking some lentil stew and Esau wants some of it.</v>

61
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.880
<v Speaker 1>Jacob refuses and,</v>

62
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.460
<v Speaker 1>and then says that he'll trade his,</v>

63
00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.860
<v Speaker 1>his birthright for it.</v>

64
00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:49.743
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

65
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.310
<v Speaker 1>Esau Greece,</v>

66
00:02:51.311 --> 00:02:53.470
<v Speaker 1>which is a bad deal,</v>

67
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.921
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

68
00:02:53.921 --> 00:02:54.970
<v Speaker 1>It's a bad deal.</v>

69
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.210
<v Speaker 1>And so you,</v>

70
00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.740
<v Speaker 1>you could say that Esau actually deserves what's to them,</v>

71
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.000
<v Speaker 1>although he at minimum,</v>

72
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:06.700
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to think of them both as being equally culpable.</v>

73
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.080
<v Speaker 1>It's a nasty trick.</v>

74
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.080
<v Speaker 1>And so that's Jacob's first trick.</v>

75
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.983
<v Speaker 1>And then</v>

76
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.270
<v Speaker 1>the second trick is that it's later and Isaac is old and blind and you know,</v>

77
00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.620
<v Speaker 1>close to death and it's time for him to bestow a blessing on his sons,</v>

78
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.310
<v Speaker 1>which is a very important event apparently among these ancient people.</v>

79
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.790
<v Speaker 1>And Esau again is out hunting and Rachel dress dresses.</v>

80
00:03:36.791 --> 00:03:38.860
<v Speaker 1>Jacob up in a hairy,</v>

81
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.810
<v Speaker 1>puts a goat skin on his arm.</v>

82
00:03:40.811 --> 00:03:43.540
<v Speaker 1>So he's kind hairy like Esol and dresses.</v>

83
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.970
<v Speaker 1>A Minnesota was closed so he smells like Esau and</v>

84
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.850
<v Speaker 1>Isaac tells Esau to go out and hunt him up.</v>

85
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.340
<v Speaker 1>Some venison I think it is.</v>

86
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.690
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

87
00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:56.770
<v Speaker 1>which is a favorite of his.</v>

88
00:03:56.771 --> 00:04:01.771
<v Speaker 1>And Rebecca has Jacob Cook up a couple of goat kids and serve that to Isaac and</v>

89
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.920
<v Speaker 1>play the role of Esol.</v>

90
00:04:05.921 --> 00:04:07.240
<v Speaker 1>And so he does that,</v>

91
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.010
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty damn nasty.</v>

92
00:04:09.011 --> 00:04:10.630
<v Speaker 1>Really all things considered,</v>

93
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

94
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.440
<v Speaker 1>to play a trick like that both on your brother and on your blind father andy in</v>

95
00:04:16.661 --> 00:04:18.070
<v Speaker 1>collusion with your mother.</v>

96
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.850
<v Speaker 1>It's not the sort of thing that's really designed to promote lot of familial</v>

97
00:04:21.851 --> 00:04:22.684
<v Speaker 1>harmony.</v>

98
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.990
<v Speaker 1>And so especially because you've already screwed them over in a big way once you</v>

99
00:04:28.241 --> 00:04:28.391
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

100
00:04:28.391 --> 00:04:30.970
<v Speaker 1>you'd think you'd think that would be sufficient.</v>

101
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.190
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

102
00:04:33.191 --> 00:04:36.460
<v Speaker 1>he's successful and ESL loses his father's blessing.</v>

103
00:04:36.461 --> 00:04:40.560
<v Speaker 1>And so that Jacob ends up really in the position of the firstborn.</v>

104
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.250
<v Speaker 1>And it's quite interesting because,</v>

105
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.721
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

106
00:04:42.721 --> 00:04:47.590
<v Speaker 1>God tells Rachel that Jacob is going to be the dominant twin and you'd think</v>

107
00:04:47.591 --> 00:04:52.390
<v Speaker 1>again with God's blessing or at least the prophecy that Jacob would end up being</v>

108
00:04:52.391 --> 00:04:53.260
<v Speaker 1>in a good guy.</v>

109
00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.590
<v Speaker 1>But he certainly not presented that way to begin with,</v>

110
00:04:56.591 --> 00:05:00.160
<v Speaker 1>which is also quite interesting given that he's the eventual founder of Israel.</v>

111
00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.940
<v Speaker 1>And it's another indication of the realism of these old stories,</v>

112
00:05:03.941 --> 00:05:04.271
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

113
00:05:04.271 --> 00:05:04.970
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

114
00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.250
<v Speaker 1>it's quite amazing to me.</v>

115
00:05:06.251 --> 00:05:10.810
<v Speaker 1>It's always been quite amazing to me how unpredictable these stories have</v>

116
00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:11.644
<v Speaker 1>remained.</v>

117
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:12.041
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

118
00:05:12.041 --> 00:05:15.460
<v Speaker 1>because you'd think that if you're even the least bit cynical,</v>

119
00:05:15.461 --> 00:05:19.690
<v Speaker 1>especially if you had the kind of Marxist religion is the opiate of the masses</v>

120
00:05:19.691 --> 00:05:20.620
<v Speaker 1>kind of viewpoint,</v>

121
00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:21.221
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

122
00:05:21.221 --> 00:05:22.720
<v Speaker 1>which is a credible viewpoint,</v>

123
00:05:22.721 --> 00:05:23.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

124
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.430
<v Speaker 1>although it's wrong,</v>

125
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.300
<v Speaker 1>but it's quite.</v>

126
00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.163
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

127
00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.550
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a shallow.</v>

128
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.330
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a shallow interpretation and not part of the reason I think it's a</v>

129
00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:35.680
<v Speaker 1>shallow interpretation is because the stories would be a lot prettier if that</v>

130
00:05:35.681 --> 00:05:36.880
<v Speaker 1>was the case.</v>

131
00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.940
<v Speaker 1>These characters wouldn't have this strange,</v>

132
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.320
<v Speaker 1>realistic,</v>

133
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.540
<v Speaker 1>moral ambiguity about them.</v>

134
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:44.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

135
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.100
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to feed people a fantasy then it,</v>

136
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.340
<v Speaker 1>you want it to be like a harlequin novel or or,</v>

137
00:05:50.341 --> 00:05:52.600
<v Speaker 1>or our greeting card or something like that.</v>

138
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:57.220
<v Speaker 1>You don't want it to be a story that's full of betrayal and deceit and murder</v>

139
00:05:57.221 --> 00:05:59.350
<v Speaker 1>and mayhem and genocide and all of that.</v>

140
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:00.970
<v Speaker 1>That just doesn't seem all that.</v>

141
00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:02.621
<v Speaker 1>What would you say?</v>

142
00:06:02.621 --> 00:06:03.430
<v Speaker 1>Calming,</v>

143
00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:04.430
<v Speaker 1>I guess would be the right,</v>
