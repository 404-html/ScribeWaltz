1
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.060
<v Speaker 1>Given that,</v>

2
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.880
<v Speaker 1>I know that people vary in their cognitive abilities tremendously and that</v>

3
00:00:10.881 --> 00:00:13.340
<v Speaker 1>that's actually an important determinant of their life outcome,</v>

4
00:00:13.341 --> 00:00:14.174
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me.</v>

5
00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.960
<v Speaker 1>So let's say someone tests out in an Iq of around 150,</v>

6
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.701
<v Speaker 1>and so you can say,</v>

7
00:00:19.701 --> 00:00:19.971
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

8
00:00:19.971 --> 00:00:20.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:21.500
<v Speaker 1>you're pretty damn smart.</v>

10
00:00:21.501 --> 00:00:21.980
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

11
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.560
<v Speaker 1>you're up above 85% of the general population.</v>

12
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:25.320
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

13
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.153
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>

14
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.540
<v Speaker 1>you could probably do a pretty damn good job as an undergraduate and university</v>

15
00:00:29.541 --> 00:00:30.800
<v Speaker 1>if you were also disciplined,</v>

16
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:31.461
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

17
00:00:31.461 --> 00:00:32.420
<v Speaker 1>If you were conscientious,</v>

18
00:00:32.421 --> 00:00:33.380
<v Speaker 1>he hit the books hard,</v>

19
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:34.573
<v Speaker 1>you're going to,</v>

20
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.400
<v Speaker 1>you're going to come out in the top core tile of your class,</v>

21
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.980
<v Speaker 1>assuming that you're not at a spectacularly success,</v>

22
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

23
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.800
<v Speaker 1>spectacularly selective university,</v>

24
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.900
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to have a much more difficult time as a master's student and</v>

25
00:00:47.901 --> 00:00:49.580
<v Speaker 1>phd level stuff is going to be,</v>

26
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.400
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be pushing your luck too to really master that.</v>

27
00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:53.643
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

28
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:54.763
<v Speaker 1>you could be,</v>

29
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:55.400
<v Speaker 1>here's a,</v>

30
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.600
<v Speaker 1>here's a domain of,</v>

31
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.150
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

32
00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.983
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

33
00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.053
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

34
00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.811
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it,</v>

35
00:00:59.811 --> 00:01:04.010
<v Speaker 1>industrial organizational activity where you could really be in the top 10</v>

36
00:01:04.011 --> 00:01:04.730
<v Speaker 1>percentile.</v>

37
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:05.031
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

38
00:01:05.031 --> 00:01:05.750
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

39
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.750
<v Speaker 1>so if you have an Iq of 115 like you might make one bang up plumber and you</v>

40
00:01:11.121 --> 00:01:14.960
<v Speaker 1>could have a spectacularly successful career as a plumber and maybe as a manager</v>

41
00:01:14.961 --> 00:01:16.580
<v Speaker 1>of other plumbers and all of that.</v>

42
00:01:16.581 --> 00:01:17.321
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

43
00:01:17.321 --> 00:01:20.570
<v Speaker 1>and I mean I actually happened to be a real FSCO now two of the trade.</v>

44
00:01:20.571 --> 00:01:22.700
<v Speaker 1>So I certainly don't think of that as something that's a,</v>

45
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.210
<v Speaker 1>that's a low quality or low status occupation in the least.</v>

46
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:27.523
<v Speaker 1>But we would,</v>

47
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.270
<v Speaker 1>we would like to tell people,</v>

48
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.133
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

49
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.010
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>

50
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:32.383
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>

51
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.973
<v Speaker 1>here's a,</v>

52
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.070
<v Speaker 1>here's an intellectual domain that's probably too high for you to be successful</v>

53
00:01:39.471 --> 00:01:40.304
<v Speaker 1>without</v>

54
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.850
<v Speaker 1>working insane hours to,</v>

55
00:01:43.851 --> 00:01:44.330
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

56
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.810
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

57
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:45.650
<v Speaker 1>to close the gap.</v>

58
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.960
<v Speaker 1>Because you can do that with insane work up to some,</v>

59
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.160
<v Speaker 1>some limited degree.</v>

60
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.590
<v Speaker 1>But it seems to me that the logical thing to do,</v>

61
00:01:51.591 --> 00:01:56.000
<v Speaker 1>at least in part is to give people a sense of what their advantages and</v>

62
00:01:56.001 --> 00:01:57.770
<v Speaker 1>limitations are and then say to them,</v>

63
00:01:57.771 --> 00:01:58.041
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

64
00:01:58.041 --> 00:02:02.810
<v Speaker 1>well given that here's a place that you could go where you could be optimally</v>

65
00:02:02.811 --> 00:02:03.770
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>

66
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.970
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

67
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:05.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

68
00:02:05.241 --> 00:02:08.120
<v Speaker 1>that's Kinda my take from a policy perspective let's say.</v>

69
00:02:08.121 --> 00:02:09.860
<v Speaker 1>But like what have you thought about,</v>

70
00:02:09.861 --> 00:02:10.694
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

71
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.870
<v Speaker 1>the massive diversity and intellectual ability mean what are the implications</v>

72
00:02:14.871 --> 00:02:17.360
<v Speaker 1>from a policy perspective as far as you're concerned?</v>

73
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.691
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

74
00:02:17.691 --> 00:02:20.120
<v Speaker 2>I think vocational guidance is clearly one.</v>

75
00:02:20.121 --> 00:02:25.100
<v Speaker 2>I actually did some consulting and some research for a nonprofit group called</v>

76
00:02:25.101 --> 00:02:26.960
<v Speaker 2>the Johnson O'connor Foundation,</v>

77
00:02:26.961 --> 00:02:29.390
<v Speaker 2>which is a vocational testing.</v>

78
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.670
<v Speaker 2>They're not that big on g,</v>

79
00:02:31.671 --> 00:02:34.010
<v Speaker 2>but they have their own battery of tests.</v>

80
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.130
<v Speaker 2>They bring someone in and do a full day of cognitive tests.</v>

81
00:02:39.801 --> 00:02:44.801
<v Speaker 2>And from that they give some advice about what kinds of professions match their</v>

82
00:02:46.521 --> 00:02:48.590
<v Speaker 2>cognitive strengths and weaknesses.</v>

83
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.790
<v Speaker 2>And I actually did some brain imaging,</v>

84
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:51.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

85
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.480
<v Speaker 2>on their test and was Neil.</v>

86
00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.890
<v Speaker 2>Very interesting stuff.</v>

87
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.083
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

88
00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.560
<v Speaker 1>do you think they do see it?</v>

89
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.640
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's to do the psychometrics properly with regards to vocational guidance</v>

90
00:03:03.671 --> 00:03:05.530
<v Speaker 1>because we don't really know.</v>

91
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.030
<v Speaker 1>We don't have a good handle on how to classify jobs into their various subtypes.</v>

92
00:03:10.031 --> 00:03:12.310
<v Speaker 1>Like John Holland has done some good work doing that.</v>

93
00:03:12.311 --> 00:03:12.880
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

94
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.520
<v Speaker 1>but there's so many jobs and it's hard to figure out,</v>

95
00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.730
<v Speaker 1>well what makes two jobs the same or similar,</v>

96
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.280
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

97
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.431
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

98
00:03:19.431 --> 00:03:23.240
<v Speaker 2>I was at Hopkins when Harlan was there and some of my friends were graduate</v>

99
00:03:23.241 --> 00:03:27.830
<v Speaker 2>students work for him and I learned all about that vocational testing.</v>

100
00:03:27.831 --> 00:03:28.880
<v Speaker 2>It's very powerful.</v>

101
00:03:28.881 --> 00:03:30.500
<v Speaker 2>And as you know it's,</v>

102
00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.910
<v Speaker 2>that's more his,</v>

103
00:03:31.911 --> 00:03:36.911
<v Speaker 2>his scales have kind of morphed into more personality like dementia.</v>

104
00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

105
00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:38.383
<v Speaker 1>What about that's it.</v>

106
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:39.050
<v Speaker 1>You want it map the,</v>

107
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.420
<v Speaker 1>well that's exactly the nexus that we want to play out.</v>

108
00:03:41.421 --> 00:03:41.781
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

109
00:03:41.781 --> 00:03:42.530
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

110
00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:43.820
<v Speaker 1>because there is a reason,</v>

111
00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.650
<v Speaker 1>I know people have been mapping Hollins Homans job categories onto the big five</v>

112
00:03:48.651 --> 00:03:50.330
<v Speaker 1>and we have a fair bit of success,</v>

113
00:03:50.331 --> 00:03:50.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

114
00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.500
<v Speaker 1>and we're hoping that the differentiation down to the to 10 levels of</v>

115
00:03:54.501 --> 00:03:56.690
<v Speaker 1>personality will provide even more precision.</v>

116
00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:57.560
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

117
00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.800
<v Speaker 1>but with more general policy let,</v>

118
00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:00.111
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

119
00:04:00.111 --> 00:04:00.621
<v Speaker 1>so fine.</v>

120
00:04:00.621 --> 00:04:01.190
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

121
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.230
<v Speaker 2>reasonable vocational counseling,</v>

122
00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:04.670
<v Speaker 2>that's a good idea.</v>

123
00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:05.990
<v Speaker 2>When does it start?</v>

124
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.790
<v Speaker 2>Does it start in junior high?</v>

125
00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.840
<v Speaker 2>Like do you do what</v>

126
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.570
<v Speaker 1>the Europeans do and start to track people into trades?</v>

127
00:04:11.571 --> 00:04:11.960
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

128
00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:12.250
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

129
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.380
<v Speaker 1>and higher education at that kind of early age.</v>

130
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.070
<v Speaker 2>Europeans seem to have had great success with that.</v>

131
00:04:19.071 --> 00:04:21.140
<v Speaker 2>So it's certainly the Germans in particular.</v>

132
00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

133
00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.420
<v Speaker 2>So it's reasonable to look at.</v>

134
00:04:23.421 --> 00:04:25.460
<v Speaker 2>But the problem in the United States,</v>

135
00:04:25.461 --> 00:04:27.590
<v Speaker 2>there were so many problems with the way we</v>

136
00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.630
<v Speaker 2>conceptualize education and the whole idea of tracking,</v>

137
00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:36.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how it is in Canada,</v>

138
00:04:36.831 --> 00:04:38.360
<v Speaker 2>but in the United States,</v>

139
00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:42.040
<v Speaker 2>this idea of tracking has a very negative valence to it.</v>

140
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.540
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

141
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.920
<v Speaker 2>segregating the smart kids into one,</v>

142
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.300
<v Speaker 2>one a set of classes and the less smart kids in daughters.</v>

143
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.850
<v Speaker 2>And then there's remedial education and,</v>

144
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.580
<v Speaker 2>and there's been a tendency,</v>

145
00:04:55.581 --> 00:05:00.581
<v Speaker 2>a strong tendency in the United States to feel that kids learn from each other.</v>

146
00:05:00.711 --> 00:05:04.610
<v Speaker 2>So you don't want homogeneous groups based on learning ability.</v>

147
00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:05.713
<v Speaker 2>Your want.</v>

148
00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.321
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

149
00:05:06.321 --> 00:05:06.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

150
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:07.251
<v Speaker 1>So funny.</v>

151
00:05:07.251 --> 00:05:12.230
<v Speaker 1>So because it's so funny because the people say that with regards to two,</v>

152
00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.700
<v Speaker 1>let's say academic achievement,</v>

153
00:05:13.701 --> 00:05:18.050
<v Speaker 1>but they play exactly the opposite stomach when it comes to such things as has</v>

154
00:05:18.051 --> 00:05:19.250
<v Speaker 1>childhood sports.</v>

155
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.791
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

156
00:05:19.791 --> 00:05:21.890
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at football for example,</v>

157
00:05:21.891 --> 00:05:22.281
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

158
00:05:22.281 --> 00:05:22.491
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

159
00:05:22.491 --> 00:05:22.821
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

160
00:05:22.821 --> 00:05:24.260
<v Speaker 1>let's segregate like ability.</v>

161
00:05:24.261 --> 00:05:27.560
<v Speaker 1>It's like you don't have the people who stumble around on the field dropping the</v>

162
00:05:27.561 --> 00:05:28.341
<v Speaker 1>ball all the time,</v>

163
00:05:28.341 --> 00:05:30.140
<v Speaker 1>play with the top end quarterbacks,</v>

164
00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.150
<v Speaker 1>and nobody thinks there's a problem with that.</v>

165
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.991
<v Speaker 1>If they don't say,</v>

166
00:05:32.991 --> 00:05:33.141
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

167
00:05:33.141 --> 00:05:35.810
<v Speaker 1>everyone learns from everyone else in that situation.</v>

168
00:05:35.811 --> 00:05:40.811
<v Speaker 1>So to me it speaks more of a refusal to admit to the stark reality that there</v>

169
00:05:42.111 --> 00:05:45.890
<v Speaker 1>are massive cognitive differences between people and to try to actually start to</v>

170
00:05:45.891 --> 00:05:47.930
<v Speaker 1>address that with some degree of seriousness.</v>
