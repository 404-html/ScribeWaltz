1
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.480
<v Speaker 1>The other shoe dropped for me then because you know,</v>

2
00:00:10.481 --> 00:00:10.741
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

3
00:00:10.741 --> 00:00:13.110
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about that at least in part,</v>

4
00:00:13.111 --> 00:00:16.650
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about that ecstatic experience as the,</v>

5
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.540
<v Speaker 1>as the necessary counter position to isolation and abandonment,</v>

6
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.130
<v Speaker 1>loneliness and all of those things,</v>

7
00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:23.251
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

8
00:00:23.251 --> 00:00:24.420
<v Speaker 1>which I think is a very,</v>

9
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.890
<v Speaker 1>a very reasonable way of thinking about it.</v>

10
00:00:27.891 --> 00:00:32.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like meaning as the antidote to isolation and Tra and tragedy and</v>

11
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:33.670
<v Speaker 1>malevolence for that matter.</v>

12
00:00:33.671 --> 00:00:35.190
<v Speaker 1>And I think music is,</v>

13
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.650
<v Speaker 1>I've thought deeply about music.</v>

15
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:38.180
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

16
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.620
<v Speaker 1>I've tried to figure out why it has,</v>

17
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.290
<v Speaker 1>what it represents and why it has the effects that it has.</v>

18
00:00:44.291 --> 00:00:44.831
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

19
00:00:44.831 --> 00:00:47.320
<v Speaker 1>and this is a neuroscientific few of it to some degree,</v>

20
00:00:47.321 --> 00:00:48.190
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

21
00:00:48.191 --> 00:00:53.191
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that it's better to think about the world as con as something</v>

22
00:00:53.351 --> 00:00:56.830
<v Speaker 1>that consists of patterns rather than as something that consists of objects.</v>

23
00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.460
<v Speaker 1>So it object would actually be a pattern that sustains itself across time.</v>

24
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.040
<v Speaker 1>It's it,</v>

25
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.230
<v Speaker 1>that's not all that very,</v>

26
00:01:02.231 --> 00:01:03.130
<v Speaker 1>very good insight.</v>

27
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.750
<v Speaker 1>You get applause for that.</v>

28
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:05.241
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

29
00:01:05.241 --> 00:01:05.651
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

30
00:01:05.651 --> 00:01:06.011
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

31
00:01:06.011 --> 00:01:07.120
<v Speaker 1>so then you think,</v>

32
00:01:07.121 --> 00:01:08.060
<v Speaker 1>well for you,</v>

33
00:01:08.061 --> 00:01:10.660
<v Speaker 1>you can even think about the way the visual system works this way.</v>

34
00:01:10.661 --> 00:01:11.560
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

35
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.780
<v Speaker 1>we tend to think that there's a world out there and then there's an image of</v>

36
00:01:14.781 --> 00:01:19.590
<v Speaker 1>that world projected onto our retina and then the images is reconstructed,</v>

37
00:01:19.591 --> 00:01:21.210
<v Speaker 1>say in our visual cortex.</v>

38
00:01:21.211 --> 00:01:22.110
<v Speaker 1>And then we,</v>

39
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

40
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.510
<v Speaker 1>then we can become conscious of that image and planner actions in,</v>

41
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.920
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

42
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:27.930
<v Speaker 1>in consequence of that.</v>

43
00:01:27.931 --> 00:01:29.460
<v Speaker 1>But that isn't how it works.</v>

44
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.640
<v Speaker 1>The way it works is that there are patterns in the world and then the patterns</v>

45
00:01:34.641 --> 00:01:37.760
<v Speaker 1>are shifted into patterns of light of illumination.</v>

46
00:01:37.761 --> 00:01:41.090
<v Speaker 1>And then those are shifted into patterns of neural activity on the retina.</v>

47
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.390
<v Speaker 1>And then those are shifted into patterns of neural conductance,</v>

48
00:01:44.391 --> 00:01:44.870
<v Speaker 1>the law,</v>

49
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:45.740
<v Speaker 1>the optical nerves,</v>

50
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.020
<v Speaker 1>and then patterns in the visual cortex.</v>

51
00:01:48.021 --> 00:01:50.690
<v Speaker 1>And then those are expressed as patterns of movement.</v>

52
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.160
<v Speaker 1>So it's all the transformations of patterns and the meaning of a visual</v>

53
00:01:55.161 --> 00:01:58.490
<v Speaker 1>perception is the pattern of action that it gives rise to,</v>

54
00:01:58.491 --> 00:02:00.950
<v Speaker 1>which is why you need a body meant to be able to perceive.</v>

55
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.450
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reason that music speaks so deeply to us of fundamental meaning</v>

56
00:02:05.451 --> 00:02:08.180
<v Speaker 1>is because it's actually the most representative art form.</v>

57
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.781
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

58
00:02:08.781 --> 00:02:10.540
<v Speaker 1>because people think about it in some senses,</v>

59
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.200
<v Speaker 1>the least representative art form,</v>

60
00:02:12.201 --> 00:02:13.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's right at all.</v>

61
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.730
<v Speaker 1>I think it represents the reality that exists in a profound sense beyond what</v>

62
00:02:18.741 --> 00:02:21.230
<v Speaker 1>our census revealed to us moment to moment.</v>

63
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.220
<v Speaker 1>And so it puts people then when you're moving to the music and we were all</v>

64
00:02:25.221 --> 00:02:26.180
<v Speaker 1>moving to the music,</v>

65
00:02:26.181 --> 00:02:27.230
<v Speaker 1>or when you're dancing,</v>

66
00:02:27.231 --> 00:02:28.610
<v Speaker 1>let's say with someone else and you're,</v>

67
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.280
<v Speaker 1>and you're as pairs and you're all dancing together,</v>

68
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.370
<v Speaker 1>it's that the patterns of the cosmos,</v>

69
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.330
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

70
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.680
<v Speaker 1>manifesting themselves as the patterns of the music manifesting themselves as</v>

71
00:02:39.681 --> 00:02:43.220
<v Speaker 1>the patterns of your body and in syncopation with everyone else.</v>

72
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.310
<v Speaker 1>So it's also a symbolic representation of a harmonious,</v>

73
00:02:46.311 --> 00:02:47.540
<v Speaker 1>an ideal society.</v>

74
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.120
<v Speaker 1>And there it is something that's beyond us.</v>

75
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.590
<v Speaker 1>And so it's,</v>

76
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.241
<v Speaker 1>it's interests.</v>

77
00:02:52.241 --> 00:02:52.851
<v Speaker 1>So I get it.</v>

78
00:02:52.851 --> 00:02:53.121
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

79
00:02:53.121 --> 00:02:54.260
<v Speaker 1>so partly what you're saying,</v>

80
00:02:54.261 --> 00:02:55.280
<v Speaker 1>if I understand you,</v>

81
00:02:55.281 --> 00:02:56.690
<v Speaker 1>is that for you,</v>

82
00:02:56.691 --> 00:02:57.460
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

83
00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.540
<v Speaker 1>the ecstatic collective that was associated with music,</v>

84
00:03:01.541 --> 00:03:02.201
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

85
00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:06.550
<v Speaker 1>in pop music perhaps was you could see it out very clearly as the antidote to</v>

86
00:03:06.551 --> 00:03:07.660
<v Speaker 1>painful isolation.</v>

87
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:08.041
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

88
00:03:08.041 --> 00:03:08.800
<v Speaker 1>and I mean,</v>

89
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.300
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that struck me as,</v>

90
00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:10.750
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

91
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.150
<v Speaker 1>as struck me as near miraculous about music,</v>

92
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:16.330
<v Speaker 1>especially in the rather nihilistic and atheistic society,</v>

93
00:03:16.331 --> 00:03:20.920
<v Speaker 1>is that it really does fill the void that was left by the death of God.</v>

94
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.700
<v Speaker 1>And it's partly because you cannot rationally critique music.</v>

95
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.811
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

96
00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:26.710
<v Speaker 1>it speaks to you,</v>

97
00:03:26.711 --> 00:03:27.790
<v Speaker 1>it speaks of meaning.</v>

98
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.650
<v Speaker 1>And no matter what you say about it,</v>

99
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.420
<v Speaker 1>no matter how cynical you are,</v>

100
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.190
<v Speaker 1>you cannot put a crowbar underneath that and lifted up and,</v>

101
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.770
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

102
00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.350
<v Speaker 1>and toss it aside.</v>

103
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.290
<v Speaker 1>And music was so,</v>

104
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.590
<v Speaker 1>such a powerful cultural force in the 60s and the 70s and it's like</v>

105
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.560
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmingly powerful force.</v>
