00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.510
<v Speaker 1>You might see the value of things before you see the object itself.</v>

2
00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:04.411
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3
00:00:04.411 --> 00:00:04.981
<v Speaker 1>there are people,</v>

4
00:00:04.981 --> 00:00:05.521
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

5
00:00:05.521 --> 00:00:06.354
<v Speaker 1>who are blind.</v>

6
00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:07.483
<v Speaker 1>They have blindsight,</v>

7
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.020
<v Speaker 1>they can recognize emotions on faces without knowing,</v>

8
00:00:10.021 --> 00:00:10.854
<v Speaker 1>they can see,</v>

9
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.990
<v Speaker 1>so that's partly because their retinas are attached to their amygdala.</v>

10
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.930
<v Speaker 1>Your retina is attached to a lot of your body,</v>

11
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.700
<v Speaker 1>not just your visual cortex.</v>

12
00:00:20.701 --> 00:00:22.110
<v Speaker 1>It's attached to your spinal cord.</v>

13
00:00:22.111 --> 00:00:24.840
<v Speaker 1>It's attached to your nervous system at multiple levels of analysis</v>

14
00:00:24.841 --> 00:00:25.800
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously,</v>

15
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.030
<v Speaker 1>and so you can use your eyes to detect things that you don't know you're seeing.</v>

16
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.540
<v Speaker 1>So then what is in some sense,</v>

17
00:00:33.541 --> 00:00:37.950
<v Speaker 1>what you often detect under those circumstances is valence value.</v>

18
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:38.970
<v Speaker 1>So you're very good,</v>

19
00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:39.804
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

20
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.410
<v Speaker 1>at detecting teeth and predatory eyes and the reasons for that are self evident.</v>

21
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.030
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally.</v>
