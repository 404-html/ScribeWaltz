3
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.800
<v Speaker 1>like yours have been to so many?</v>

4
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.431
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5
00:00:13.431 --> 00:00:14.264
<v Speaker 1>Nathan,</v>

6
00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:15.223
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:15.890
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

8
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.960
<v Speaker 1>I would say not really.</v>

9
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:19.010
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

10
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.843
<v Speaker 1>although,</v>

11
00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.751
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:00:20.751 --> 00:00:21.321
<v Speaker 1>when I went,</v>

13
00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:23.990
<v Speaker 1>I went to this little college called Grand Prairie Regional College.</v>

14
00:00:23.991 --> 00:00:25.850
<v Speaker 1>It was a way the hell up in northern Alberta.</v>

15
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.440
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

16
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:28.070
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

17
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.750
<v Speaker 1>there's only 600 people that went,</v>

18
00:00:29.751 --> 00:00:31.670
<v Speaker 1>it was an adjunct of the University of Alberta.</v>

19
00:00:31.671 --> 00:00:32.600
<v Speaker 1>It's still exists.</v>

20
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:33.950
<v Speaker 1>It's really lovely building.</v>

21
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.240
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

22
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.550
<v Speaker 1>and we had professors there.</v>

23
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:38.740
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

24
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.370
<v Speaker 1>An English professor and the political science professor in biology,</v>

25
00:00:42.371 --> 00:00:43.780
<v Speaker 1>professor philosophy professor,</v>

26
00:00:43.781 --> 00:00:47.620
<v Speaker 1>people that I still remember little seminars and they,</v>

27
00:00:47.621 --> 00:00:50.440
<v Speaker 1>we got deeply into the material and I really,</v>

28
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.240
<v Speaker 1>it really helped me a lot.</v>

29
00:00:52.241 --> 00:00:55.810
<v Speaker 1>This English professor really taught me to write to because he just slashed my</v>

30
00:00:55.811 --> 00:00:57.250
<v Speaker 1>essays to ribbons.</v>

31
00:00:57.251 --> 00:01:00.760
<v Speaker 1>I was really upset the first time I got a bad grade because I'd always got good</v>

32
00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:02.530
<v Speaker 1>grades and my papers in high school,</v>

33
00:01:02.531 --> 00:01:04.240
<v Speaker 1>even though they were dreadful.</v>

34
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:04.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

35
00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:05.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:10.231
<v Speaker 1>I was verbally intelligent enough to be able to compose an essay that was better</v>

37
00:01:10.661 --> 00:01:14.500
<v Speaker 1>than most with very little effort and with very little quality.</v>

38
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.180
<v Speaker 1>And so that was very influential to me and I did a lot of reading under the</v>

39
00:01:19.181 --> 00:01:23.080
<v Speaker 1>tutelage of those professors in these tiny little courses in my first year.</v>

40
00:01:23.081 --> 00:01:27.430
<v Speaker 1>But mostly what's been helpful to me have been books.</v>

41
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.050
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

42
00:01:29.051 --> 00:01:29.970
<v Speaker 1>I read Nietzsche,</v>

43
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.330
<v Speaker 1>I didn't read all of nature,</v>

44
00:01:31.331 --> 00:01:33.400
<v Speaker 1>but I would read all that was easily,</v>

45
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.960
<v Speaker 1>easily accessible,</v>

46
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.790
<v Speaker 1>published works of nature in sequential order in the order in which they were</v>

47
00:01:39.791 --> 00:01:43.450
<v Speaker 1>written when I was in my twenties and I read everything that young had published</v>

48
00:01:43.451 --> 00:01:45.620
<v Speaker 1>it when I was in my twenties and um,</v>

49
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.050
<v Speaker 1>and well,</v>

50
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.480
<v Speaker 1>and the same with a wide variety of other authors.</v>

51
00:01:49.481 --> 00:01:51.220
<v Speaker 1>And so those were like lecture series and they were,</v>

52
00:01:51.221 --> 00:01:53.140
<v Speaker 1>I was unbelievably useful to me.</v>

53
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.120
<v Speaker 1>I put some of those books on my reading this.</v>

54
00:01:55.121 --> 00:01:55.870
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

55
00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:56.703
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

56
00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.440
<v Speaker 1>could you please tell us your second ghost story as mentioned on h three h three</v>

57
00:02:02.441 --> 00:02:03.274
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>

58
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.780
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

59
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:05.560
<v Speaker 1>Nicholas,</v>

60
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.170
<v Speaker 1>if you asked me that at the next Q and a and people voted up,</v>

61
00:02:08.171 --> 00:02:09.220
<v Speaker 1>then I'll tell the story,</v>

62
00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.620
<v Speaker 1>but I can't right now cause it's a long story and I'm just about out of</v>

63
00:02:12.621 --> 00:02:14.740
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] and brain and time.</v>

64
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.030
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

65
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.550
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to answer two more questions I think,</v>

66
00:02:18.551 --> 00:02:22.870
<v Speaker 1>and then I'm going to stop because I really am running out of,</v>

67
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.973
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

68
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.993
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>

69
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:28.410
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>
