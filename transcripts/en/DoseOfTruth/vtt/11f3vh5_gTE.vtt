00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:07.140
<v Speaker 1>That's funny,</v>

2
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.150
<v Speaker 1>I was just talking to one of my graduate students,</v>

3
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.170
<v Speaker 1>we'd be looking at the determinants of male attractiveness by the personality of</v>

4
00:00:16.171 --> 00:00:17.610
<v Speaker 1>female viewers.</v>

5
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.140
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

6
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.380
<v Speaker 1>And so what we found is that there are some personality affects.</v>

7
00:00:22.381 --> 00:00:24.210
<v Speaker 1>So I'm extroverted,</v>

8
00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:28.680
<v Speaker 1>enthusiastic women tend to rate men generally speaking as more attractive than</v>

9
00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:29.400
<v Speaker 1>introverted,</v>

10
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.940
<v Speaker 1>introverted,</v>

11
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.260
<v Speaker 1>less enthusiastic women.</v>

12
00:00:31.261 --> 00:00:32.180
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

13
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:33.481
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

14
00:00:33.481 --> 00:00:36.000
<v Speaker 1>so there are some just straight personality effects,</v>

15
00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:39.000
<v Speaker 1>but the biggest effect by far we found was the proclivity of,</v>

16
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.560
<v Speaker 1>of women in general to rape men as less attractive as the women's Iq increased.</v>
