1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.810
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be resentful and bitter</v>
<v Speaker 1>in many situations because you don't get</v>

2
00:00:03.811 --> 00:00:06.240
<v Speaker 1>what you want and if you watch that</v>
<v Speaker 1>resentment,</v>

3
00:00:06.241 --> 00:00:07.200
<v Speaker 1>bitterness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clc,</v>

4
00:00:07.201 --> 00:00:11.910
<v Speaker 1>that it produces fantasies that can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably dark and that can be very</v>

5
00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:15.270
<v Speaker 1>frightening and you might not want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>admit to yourself that you're actually</v>

6
00:00:15.271 --> 00:00:19.950
<v Speaker 1>capable of having fantasies like that or</v>
<v Speaker 1>impulses of like that or aggressive</v>

7
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.670
<v Speaker 1>feelings like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is is that if those</v>

8
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.570
<v Speaker 1>aggressive feelings and impulses and</v>
<v Speaker 1>fantasies are integrated into your</v>

9
00:00:27.571 --> 00:00:29.580
<v Speaker 1>character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're opening up a dialogue</v>

10
00:00:29.581 --> 00:00:33.600
<v Speaker 1>with a part of yourself that can be very</v>
<v Speaker 1>forceful and strong and dangerous,</v>

11
00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:38.100
<v Speaker 1>and it's really useful to be dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you can,</v>

12
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.280
<v Speaker 1>if you can be dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you often don't have to be,</v>

13
00:00:41.281 --> 00:00:42.900
<v Speaker 1>and it's often weak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People,</v>

14
00:00:42.901 --> 00:00:45.000
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weak men generally speaking,</v>

15
00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:47.370
<v Speaker 1>who rape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that that's a very,</v>

16
00:00:47.371 --> 00:00:49.590
<v Speaker 1>very common occurrence and that's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>violent act,</v>

17
00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:51.960
<v Speaker 1>but it's born out of weakness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not out of strength.</v>

18
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.990
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so anyways,</v>

19
00:00:54.991 --> 00:00:58.470
<v Speaker 1>you attend to your resentment honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you observe yourself and what you're</v>

20
00:00:58.471 --> 00:01:01.110
<v Speaker 1>actually like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to pay attention as if you don't</v>

21
00:01:01.111 --> 00:01:04.800
<v Speaker 1>know yourself as if you might harbor</v>
<v Speaker 1>hidden devils and then maybe they'll</v>

22
00:01:04.801 --> 00:01:05.634
<v Speaker 1>emerge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

23
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.340
<v Speaker 1>Young also felt that sort of embedded</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside the shower where the contra</v>

24
00:01:09.341 --> 00:01:13.450
<v Speaker 1>sexual tendencies and so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you see people who are well</v>

25
00:01:13.451 --> 00:01:15.810
<v Speaker 1>developed men let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we can.</v>

26
00:01:15.811 --> 00:01:18.060
<v Speaker 1>We can also talk about women in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>regard.</v>

27
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.980
<v Speaker 1>Men who've integrated their shadow often</v>
<v Speaker 1>also develop a kind of peculiar grace</v>

28
00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:27.981
<v Speaker 1>that would be a consequence of not only</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowing their aggressive side to step</v>

29
00:01:28.111 --> 00:01:31.140
<v Speaker 1>forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also their feminine in Compassionate</v>

30
00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:33.660
<v Speaker 1>side that might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they may have kept squelched</v>

31
00:01:33.661 --> 00:01:36.450
<v Speaker 1>because of embarrassment about it or</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they'd been harassed for being</v>

32
00:01:36.451 --> 00:01:40.050
<v Speaker 1>weak or any number of things so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the practical approach for</v>

33
00:01:40.051 --> 00:01:44.010
<v Speaker 1>developing your shadow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say is to contemplate and</v>

34
00:01:44.011 --> 00:01:48.210
<v Speaker 1>consider your resentment and notice what</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says and because your resentment will</v>

35
00:01:48.211 --> 00:01:50.190
<v Speaker 1>also tell you what you have to say.</v>

36
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.220
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so look,</v>

37
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.880
<v Speaker 1>look at what happened at Google this</v>
<v Speaker 1>weekend.</v>

38
00:01:53.881 --> 00:01:56.280
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>James Damore wrote that memo and you can</v>

39
00:01:56.281 --> 00:02:00.630
<v Speaker 1>imagine he was pretty angry and perhaps</v>
<v Speaker 1>even somewhat resentful at having to</v>

40
00:02:00.631 --> 00:02:03.360
<v Speaker 1>attend that diversity seminar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm really just using this as an</v>

41
00:02:03.361 --> 00:02:07.440
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what he did was decide that that</v>

42
00:02:07.441 --> 00:02:10.860
<v Speaker 1>meant that he had something that he had</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say and then look at the consequences</v>

43
00:02:10.861 --> 00:02:11.491
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

44
00:02:11.491 --> 00:02:14.220
<v Speaker 1>It's an absolutely unbelievable and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

45
00:02:14.221 --> 00:02:18.120
<v Speaker 1>if you're feeling oppressed at work or</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're oppressed in your life or or you</v>

46
00:02:18.121 --> 00:02:21.390
<v Speaker 1>know where you're expressing yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you got to notice that you're</v>

47
00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:23.130
<v Speaker 1>feeling oppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you have to notice that you're</v>

48
00:02:23.131 --> 00:02:25.170
<v Speaker 1>feeling resentful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resentful,</v>

49
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.500
<v Speaker 1>and angry and bitter and maybe even like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cain in the story of Cain and Abel</v>

50
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.920
<v Speaker 1>because Cain is sort of the archetype of</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitter man.</v>

51
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.670
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to decide what it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you need to do in order to remove</v>

52
00:02:35.671 --> 00:02:37.110
<v Speaker 1>from yourself that bitterness.</v>

53
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.230
<v Speaker 1>And that's usually means that there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that you have to say and then</v>

54
00:02:40.231 --> 00:02:42.630
<v Speaker 1>you have to say it because you're soul</v>
<v Speaker 1>depends on it.</v>

55
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.610
<v Speaker 1>And not only does your soul depend on</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

56
00:02:44.611 --> 00:02:48.150
<v Speaker 1>I would say the fate of the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>depends on it because you know you might</v>

57
00:02:48.151 --> 00:02:50.640
<v Speaker 1>be wrong and then you should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>straightened out.</v>

58
00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.370
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're just being windy and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to talk to somebody about that,</v>

59
00:02:53.371 --> 00:02:56.430
<v Speaker 1>but it may be that you're actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>detecting something wrong.</v>

60
00:02:56.431 --> 00:02:59.190
<v Speaker 1>Some tyranny that's directed towards you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and other people,</v>

61
00:02:59.191 --> 00:03:02.040
<v Speaker 1>and it's like your moral obligation to</v>
<v Speaker 1>speak up about it.</v>
