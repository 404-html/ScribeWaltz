1
00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:06.180
<v Speaker 1>I started to introduce all those topics because I was trying to address the</v>

2
00:00:06.181 --> 00:00:10.830
<v Speaker 1>issue of how it is that we've come to deal with the fact that things are so</v>

3
00:00:10.831 --> 00:00:15.600
<v Speaker 1>complex that we can't deal with them and so a huge part of the answer to that is</v>

4
00:00:15.601 --> 00:00:16.800
<v Speaker 1>the Darwinian answers.</v>

5
00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:20.550
<v Speaker 1>One is while you keep up with things you can't keep up with by changing</v>

6
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.413
<v Speaker 1>unpredictably.</v>

7
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.190
<v Speaker 1>So here's an example.</v>

8
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.600
<v Speaker 1>You know sometimes if you're driving down the road and there's a deer on the</v>

9
00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:28.434
<v Speaker 1>road,</v>

10
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.050
<v Speaker 1>maybe you'll run into it and it'll instead of jumping out of the way,</v>

11
00:00:31.051 --> 00:00:33.450
<v Speaker 1>it sort of jumps randomly and then you run into it.</v>

12
00:00:33.451 --> 00:00:33.751
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>

13
00:00:33.751 --> 00:00:35.220
<v Speaker 1>well that's a pretty stupid strategy.</v>

14
00:00:35.221 --> 00:00:38.400
<v Speaker 1>It's like natural selection at work there,</v>

15
00:00:38.401 --> 00:00:41.790
<v Speaker 1>but it turns out that deer jump randomly when wolves are chasing them.</v>

16
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

17
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:43.920
<v Speaker 1>why would you do that?</v>

18
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:44.251
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

19
00:00:44.251 --> 00:00:45.360
<v Speaker 1>because you can't predict it,</v>

20
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.080
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

21
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.390
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

22
00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.860
<v Speaker 1>if something horrible is after you acting unpredictably is actually a pretty</v>

23
00:00:49.861 --> 00:00:53.280
<v Speaker 1>good strategy and that's basically what mutation does means.</v>

24
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.900
<v Speaker 1>The horrible thing that's after you always is the rapid transformation of the</v>

25
00:00:57.901 --> 00:01:01.800
<v Speaker 1>environment and the only thing you can possibly do in that in that case is</v>

26
00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:03.150
<v Speaker 1>capitalize on chance.</v>

27
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.631
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

28
00:01:03.631 --> 00:01:04.464
<v Speaker 1>so that's one thing.</v>

29
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.460
<v Speaker 1>So that's partly why the Darwinian story I think has to be right,</v>

30
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.330
<v Speaker 1>because the environment does move unpredictably and the only way you can keep up</v>

31
00:01:14.791 --> 00:01:15.990
<v Speaker 1>with something that's unpredictable,</v>

32
00:01:15.991 --> 00:01:20.991
<v Speaker 1>to generate variance and hope that one of them has drawn the lucky lottery card,</v>

33
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.750
<v Speaker 1>but then there's these additional issues which is that we're also.</v>

34
00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:29.751
<v Speaker 1>We also seem to be tightly selected for the capacity to cooperate and compete.</v>

35
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.980
<v Speaker 1>So that multiplies our cognitive ability.</v>

36
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.180
<v Speaker 1>That's a huge part of it.</v>

37
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.400
<v Speaker 1>And then we're also.</v>

38
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.040
<v Speaker 1>We also seem to have constructed ourselves,</v>

39
00:01:38.041 --> 00:01:38.874
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

40
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.810
<v Speaker 1>through sexual choice into these general problem,</v>

41
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.891
<v Speaker 1>general purpose,</v>

42
00:01:43.891 --> 00:01:45.150
<v Speaker 1>problem solving creatures.</v>

43
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.510
<v Speaker 1>And so we've internalized some of the Darwinian process.</v>

44
00:01:48.511 --> 00:01:49.590
<v Speaker 1>So you think,</v>

45
00:01:49.591 --> 00:01:50.424
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

46
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.990
<v Speaker 1>most animals will produce a variance of themselves physically and then most of</v>

47
00:01:54.991 --> 00:01:55.980
<v Speaker 1>those variants die,</v>

48
00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.000
<v Speaker 1>but human beings have built A.</v>

49
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.530
<v Speaker 1>Lance built a mechanism,</v>

50
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.170
<v Speaker 1>let's say that's like a game engine.</v>

51
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.340
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a really good.</v>

52
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.620
<v Speaker 1>You know how there are game engines now that people have devised their,</v>

53
00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.460
<v Speaker 1>their computational devices and you can take a game engine and you can generate</v>

54
00:02:14.461 --> 00:02:16.050
<v Speaker 1>games with it like computer games.</v>

55
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.280
<v Speaker 1>So I'm the game engine is a mechanism for producing games.</v>

56
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.491
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

57
00:02:20.491 --> 00:02:21.990
<v Speaker 1>that's what our brains are like.</v>

58
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.080
<v Speaker 1>Our brains are game engines for producing games and so what happens is that when</v>

59
00:02:27.241 --> 00:02:29.400
<v Speaker 1>you think you produce an Avatar of yourself,</v>

60
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.110
<v Speaker 1>you produce a fictional world and that that Avatar and habits and maybe you</v>

61
00:02:34.111 --> 00:02:36.720
<v Speaker 1>produce multiple fictional worlds in multiple avatars,</v>

62
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.910
<v Speaker 1>that's the EU that could be tomorrow,</v>

63
00:02:38.911 --> 00:02:42.990
<v Speaker 1>which is what you're doing when you're planning and you walk the Avatar through</v>

64
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.920
<v Speaker 1>its potential routes and those that look good and you keep and those that don't</v>

65
00:02:46.921 --> 00:02:47.221
<v Speaker 1>look good,</v>

66
00:02:47.221 --> 00:02:49.860
<v Speaker 1>you kill and so you can.</v>

67
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.600
<v Speaker 1>Then you can embody the ideas that you keep an act those out and hopefully the</v>

68
00:02:54.601 --> 00:02:56.460
<v Speaker 1>idea is that when you embody them,</v>

69
00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.770
<v Speaker 1>you're successful and you don't get killed.</v>

70
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.610
<v Speaker 1>And so we're select.</v>

71
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.510
<v Speaker 1>We've also seen that when we've been selecting each other for cognitive prowess,</v>

72
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.160
<v Speaker 1>we've been selecting ourselves for the ability to generate avatars out of</v>

73
00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:11.500
<v Speaker 1>ourself and kill them instead of dying.</v>

74
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.240
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievably brilliant.</v>

75
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.990
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

76
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.320
<v Speaker 1>and that's really akin to the human discovery of the future.</v>

77
00:03:17.321 --> 00:03:17.531
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

78
00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:20.290
<v Speaker 1>The future is a place where variance of you could exist.</v>

79
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.800
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that and other animals don't seem to be able to do that.</v>

80
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.320
<v Speaker 1>So we're very sneaky.</v>

81
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.620
<v Speaker 1>And while so far doesn't seem to be working too badly,</v>

82
00:03:29.621 --> 00:03:31.240
<v Speaker 1>although we haven't been around for very long,</v>

83
00:03:31.241 --> 00:03:31.481
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

84
00:03:31.481 --> 00:03:36.481
<v Speaker 1>I mean human beings of our particular sub species about 150,000 years,</v>

85
00:03:36.761 --> 00:03:37.594
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

86
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.450
<v Speaker 1>which is from an evolutionary timeframe.</v>

87
00:03:40.451 --> 00:03:42.370
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's nothing,</v>

88
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

89
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.430
<v Speaker 1>it's 2080 year old man.</v>

90
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.020
<v Speaker 1>It's not very long,</v>

91
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:47.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

92
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:48.820
<v Speaker 1>if you think about it that way.</v>

93
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.193
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

94
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:51.603
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

95
00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.920
<v Speaker 1>now what I want to do is draw a relationship between that developmental process,</v>

96
00:04:03.921 --> 00:04:08.690
<v Speaker 1>that evolutionary process and the emergence of these underlying motivational</v>

97
00:04:08.691 --> 00:04:09.524
<v Speaker 1>systems.</v>

98
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.090
<v Speaker 1>It's something like this.</v>

99
00:04:11.091 --> 00:04:14.120
<v Speaker 1>So you imagine you go back in time to the emergence of the development of</v>

100
00:04:14.121 --> 00:04:15.080
<v Speaker 1>nervous systems.</v>

101
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.470
<v Speaker 1>So there's cells that creatures use to do produce motor output,</v>

102
00:04:22.161 --> 00:04:26.780
<v Speaker 1>and there are cells that creatures use to map the patterns around them onto</v>

103
00:04:26.781 --> 00:04:27.321
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

104
00:04:27.321 --> 00:04:28.790
<v Speaker 1>And so those are that sensory.</v>

105
00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.230
<v Speaker 1>That's the sensory layer,</v>

106
00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.093
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

107
00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.590
<v Speaker 1>Imagine sensory layer,</v>

108
00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.960
<v Speaker 1>nervous layer,</v>

109
00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:37.453
<v Speaker 1>motor layer.</v>

110
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:38.870
<v Speaker 1>In simpler animals,</v>

111
00:04:38.871 --> 00:04:40.700
<v Speaker 1>you just have sensory motor cells.</v>

112
00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.880
<v Speaker 1>Then they diversify sensory layer,</v>

113
00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.043
<v Speaker 1>nervous layer,</v>

114
00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.040
<v Speaker 1>motor layer.</v>

115
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.371
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

116
00:04:46.371 --> 00:04:50.030
<v Speaker 1>that's actually what you consist of when you're first developing in utero.</v>

117
00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.890
<v Speaker 1>After the blast site stage,</v>

118
00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.360
<v Speaker 1>when your cells differentiate,</v>

119
00:04:53.361 --> 00:04:54.380
<v Speaker 1>that's the differentiation.</v>

120
00:04:54.381 --> 00:04:55.310
<v Speaker 1>Sensory layer,</v>

121
00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.473
<v Speaker 1>nervous layer,</v>

122
00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:57.500
<v Speaker 1>motor layer.</v>

123
00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.150
<v Speaker 1>So then you think there's a sensory layer.</v>

124
00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.520
<v Speaker 1>Now what's that sensory layer doing?</v>

125
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.080
<v Speaker 1>Think about the world as consists consisting of patterns of all sorts,</v>

126
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.890
<v Speaker 1>like maybe there's an animal in the ocean and it's being subjected to wave</v>

127
00:05:11.891 --> 00:05:12.724
<v Speaker 1>motion,</v>

128
00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.320
<v Speaker 1>and so it's sensory systems map the wave motion onto the motor output.</v>

129
00:05:17.321 --> 00:05:18.760
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at a sponge,</v>

130
00:05:18.761 --> 00:05:19.594
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

131
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.260
<v Speaker 1>sponges are good examples because they're sort of half unicellular animals and</v>

132
00:05:23.261 --> 00:05:24.420
<v Speaker 1>half multicellular animals.</v>

133
00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.630
<v Speaker 1>You can take a sponge and run it through a colander and separate it out into</v>

134
00:05:28.631 --> 00:05:29.464
<v Speaker 1>cells,</v>

135
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.880
<v Speaker 1>say in salt water,</v>

136
00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.340
<v Speaker 1>and it'll assemble itself back into a sponge.</v>

137
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.710
<v Speaker 1>So it sort of at the.</v>

138
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:35.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

139
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.730
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>

140
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:36.563
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

141
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.200
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of what you do in Utero.</v>

142
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.880
<v Speaker 1>It sells somehow know enough to communicate with another to one another to</v>

143
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.790
<v Speaker 1>organize themselves into an organism's.</v>

144
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:47.171
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievable.</v>

145
00:05:47.171 --> 00:05:51.800
<v Speaker 1>We have no idea how people do that because when you're in the initial form blast</v>

146
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:52.360
<v Speaker 1>site form,</v>

147
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.330
<v Speaker 1>all those cells are identical genetically and then all of a sudden they</v>

148
00:05:55.331 --> 00:05:58.430
<v Speaker 1>differentiate and they moved other places they're supposed to go.</v>

149
00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:59.780
<v Speaker 1>We have no idea how that.</v>

150
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.400
<v Speaker 1>How the hell can that happen?</v>

151
00:06:01.401 --> 00:06:01.831
<v Speaker 1>These cells,</v>

152
00:06:01.831 --> 00:06:04.280
<v Speaker 1>they're all identical except for their position,</v>

153
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.630
<v Speaker 1>so they're obviously communicating with one another in some unbelievably</v>

154
00:06:08.631 --> 00:06:10.460
<v Speaker 1>complicated way and saying,</v>

155
00:06:10.461 --> 00:06:10.910
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

156
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:14.090
<v Speaker 1>you know this sort of sell it and so you're going to differentiate that way.</v>

157
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.433
<v Speaker 1>God only knows,</v>

158
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.091
<v Speaker 1>but anyway,</v>

159
00:06:16.091 --> 00:06:17.150
<v Speaker 1>sponges can do this.</v>

160
00:06:17.151 --> 00:06:17.984
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

161
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:23.180
<v Speaker 1>a sponge isn't complicated enough to have the sensory layer and the service</v>

162
00:06:23.181 --> 00:06:24.230
<v Speaker 1>layer and the motor layer.</v>

163
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.090
<v Speaker 1>It's just sensory motor cells,</v>

164
00:06:26.091 --> 00:06:27.020
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>

165
00:06:27.021 --> 00:06:30.950
<v Speaker 1>but what the sponge is trying to figure out is it wants to get water through its</v>

166
00:06:30.951 --> 00:06:35.951
<v Speaker 1>pores inside because that's how it eats and so there's wave motion constantly</v>

167
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:40.190
<v Speaker 1>and so what's happening is the wave motion is a pattern and the sponges reacting</v>

168
00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:42.440
<v Speaker 1>to that in a patterned way and that's a really.</v>

169
00:06:42.441 --> 00:06:47.390
<v Speaker 1>It's really useful to think about what you're responding to as patterns instead</v>

170
00:06:47.391 --> 00:06:49.880
<v Speaker 1>of objects because we think we react to objects,</v>

171
00:06:49.881 --> 00:06:54.881
<v Speaker 1>but objects are actually a specific subcategory of pattern and so because they</v>

172
00:06:54.961 --> 00:06:56.990
<v Speaker 1>don't also helps to explain perception.</v>

173
00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.620
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

174
00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:57.780
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

175
00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.600
<v Speaker 1>what does it mean for you to see something?</v>

176
00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:00.643
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

177
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:02.330
<v Speaker 1>it means a bunch of things,</v>

178
00:07:02.331 --> 00:07:06.050
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things that means is when I look at that thing,</v>

179
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:10.220
<v Speaker 1>it manifests itself to me as a grippable object.</v>

180
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean that that's built into the way I see it.</v>

181
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:17.240
<v Speaker 1>So if you think about the way that you see that on the surface there,</v>

182
00:07:17.241 --> 00:07:19.880
<v Speaker 1>you can tell that it's separate from the surface because it has a bit of a</v>

183
00:07:19.881 --> 00:07:24.881
<v Speaker 1>shadow and it's a different color and it's obviously shaped for a hand and so</v>

184
00:07:25.491 --> 00:07:28.820
<v Speaker 1>that thing tells you when you look at it that it's the grabbable object.</v>

185
00:07:28.821 --> 00:07:29.090
<v Speaker 1>Well it's,</v>

186
00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:34.090
<v Speaker 1>it's hand shaped like a stone tool would be and so and all the things around you</v>

187
00:07:34.911 --> 00:07:38.900
<v Speaker 1>in the world manifest themselves as patterns of utility that that's the</v>

188
00:07:38.901 --> 00:07:39.950
<v Speaker 1>appropriate way to think about it.</v>

189
00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:40.581
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

190
00:07:40.581 --> 00:07:40.731
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

191
00:07:40.731 --> 00:07:42.170
<v Speaker 1>what does this thing mean?</v>

192
00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:43.610
<v Speaker 1>Because that's a hard question.</v>

193
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:44.803
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

194
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:46.790
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that your eyes do,</v>

195
00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:47.630
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

196
00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:51.500
<v Speaker 1>imagine you've got this representational surface at the back of your retina.</v>

197
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.760
<v Speaker 1>It's made out of pixels,</v>

198
00:07:52.761 --> 00:07:53.630
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

199
00:07:53.631 --> 00:07:53.841
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

200
00:07:53.841 --> 00:07:58.841
<v Speaker 1>Those are the cells and what it does is map that pattern onto your retinal</v>

201
00:07:59.061 --> 00:08:03.290
<v Speaker 1>pattern and then the retinal pattern propagates itself as a nervous pattern</v>

202
00:08:03.291 --> 00:08:03.561
<v Speaker 1>loan.</v>

203
00:08:03.561 --> 00:08:04.400
<v Speaker 1>Your optic nerve.</v>

204
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:09.200
<v Speaker 1>And then that manifests itself as a neurological pattern and that neurological</v>

205
00:08:09.201 --> 00:08:11.690
<v Speaker 1>pattern manifests itself as an action pattern.</v>

206
00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:16.880
<v Speaker 1>And so the meaning of the object is the action pattern that is mapped onto the,</v>

207
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:18.590
<v Speaker 1>onto the percept.</v>

208
00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:21.740
<v Speaker 1>And so what does this mean?</v>

209
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:23.040
<v Speaker 1>This is what it means.</v>

210
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:25.850
<v Speaker 1>I think this is a Piagetian observation.</v>

211
00:08:25.851 --> 00:08:27.350
<v Speaker 1>It's like wonder many</v>

212
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.193
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

213
00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:31.963
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

214
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.260
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm acting like it's one,</v>

215
00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:34.610
<v Speaker 1>but if I do this</v>

216
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:41.680
<v Speaker 1>then it's many y one,</v>

217
00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:42.830
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

218
00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:45.590
<v Speaker 1>right there separately manipulable entities.</v>

219
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:50.390
<v Speaker 1>And so the concept of number is in fact predicated,</v>

220
00:08:50.391 --> 00:08:51.350
<v Speaker 1>at least in part</v>

221
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:55.770
<v Speaker 1>on the idea of singular usability.</v>

222
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:56.821
<v Speaker 1>But you're mapping.</v>

223
00:08:56.821 --> 00:08:57.241
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

224
00:08:57.241 --> 00:08:58.021
<v Speaker 1>well what is this?</v>

225
00:08:58.021 --> 00:08:58.650
<v Speaker 1>It's a key.</v>

226
00:08:58.650 --> 00:08:58.891
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

227
00:08:58.891 --> 00:08:59.641
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>

228
00:08:59.641 --> 00:08:59.791
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

229
00:08:59.791 --> 00:09:03.810
<v Speaker 1>I mapping that shape into this motion for that action say,</v>

230
00:09:03.811 --> 00:09:03.961
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

231
00:09:03.961 --> 00:09:05.010
<v Speaker 1>it's not just a key,</v>

232
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:06.383
<v Speaker 1>it's a weapon,</v>

233
00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:08.123
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

234
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:10.800
<v Speaker 1>And so that's because I've mapped it onto a different output pattern.</v>

235
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:15.090
<v Speaker 1>But if you think about perception as the matching of patterns onto patterns,</v>

236
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:15.721
<v Speaker 1>it makes,</v>

237
00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:17.280
<v Speaker 1>it makes way more sense.</v>

238
00:09:17.281 --> 00:09:19.380
<v Speaker 1>You can really start thinking about how perception works,</v>

239
00:09:19.381 --> 00:09:22.620
<v Speaker 1>because then you can also start thinking about unconscious perception.</v>

240
00:09:22.621 --> 00:09:23.730
<v Speaker 1>So you know the,</v>

241
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.790
<v Speaker 1>the blind sight experiments show for example,</v>

242
00:09:26.791 --> 00:09:28.100
<v Speaker 1>that if,</v>

243
00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:29.880
<v Speaker 1>if you've had cortical damage,</v>

244
00:09:29.881 --> 00:09:31.320
<v Speaker 1>so you think you're blind,</v>

245
00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.300
<v Speaker 1>you can't see objects anymore,</v>

246
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.720
<v Speaker 1>but I show you a picture of a frightened face,</v>

247
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.540
<v Speaker 1>you'll show us in skin conductance response to it and you think,</v>

248
00:09:39.541 --> 00:09:39.661
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

249
00:09:39.661 --> 00:09:40.770
<v Speaker 1>how the hell can that happen?</v>

250
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:45.770
<v Speaker 1>It's like I have to see the face in order to infer the emotion in order to have</v>

251
00:09:46.141 --> 00:09:46.831
<v Speaker 1>the reaction.</v>

252
00:09:46.831 --> 00:09:47.101
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

253
00:09:47.101 --> 00:09:47.251
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

254
00:09:47.251 --> 00:09:47.880
<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>

255
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:48.900
<v Speaker 1>You don't need that at all.</v>

256
00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:54.260
<v Speaker 1>You need a pattern recognition system that maps that right onto an amygdala</v>

257
00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:57.570
<v Speaker 1>output that produces physiological readiness.</v>

258
00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.510
<v Speaker 1>You don't need the perceptible entity because you know,</v>

259
00:10:00.511 --> 00:10:03.660
<v Speaker 1>you think you see something and then you think about the thing and then you</v>

260
00:10:03.661 --> 00:10:05.160
<v Speaker 1>evaluate the thing and then you act.</v>

261
00:10:05.161 --> 00:10:06.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like you do do that.</v>

262
00:10:06.691 --> 00:10:08.610
<v Speaker 1>But there are parts of you that don't do that at all.</v>

263
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:10.200
<v Speaker 1>Way Faster parts,</v>

264
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:11.340
<v Speaker 1>more primordial parts.</v>

265
00:10:11.341 --> 00:10:15.300
<v Speaker 1>And so another example would be Darwin's trick with the snake that I told you</v>

266
00:10:15.301 --> 00:10:15.481
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

267
00:10:15.481 --> 00:10:20.481
<v Speaker 1>He'd go to this museum that had a cobra in a glass cage and the Cobra,</v>

268
00:10:20.641 --> 00:10:23.790
<v Speaker 1>he'd put his face up to the glass cage and the Cobra would strike out him and</v>

269
00:10:23.791 --> 00:10:24.660
<v Speaker 1>he'd go like this,</v>

270
00:10:24.661 --> 00:10:26.640
<v Speaker 1>and there was no way he could control that.</v>

271
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:27.151
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

272
00:10:27.151 --> 00:10:32.151
<v Speaker 1>it's because the part of him that saw the snake wasn't the part that was doing</v>

273
00:10:32.461 --> 00:10:33.294
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

274
00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.970
<v Speaker 1>There's a part of him that does this to snakes.</v>

275
00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:37.330
<v Speaker 1>That's what it does and it's.</v>

276
00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:39.720
<v Speaker 1>It's way faster than the per unit figure,</v>

277
00:10:39.721 --> 00:10:43.610
<v Speaker 1>the to see the snake you have to the images.</v>

278
00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:45.060
<v Speaker 1>Obviously the image,</v>

279
00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:50.070
<v Speaker 1>the pattern is portrayed on the retina propagates backwards to see it.</v>

280
00:10:50.071 --> 00:10:53.340
<v Speaker 1>It has to be elaborated up through a very complex set of neurological</v>

281
00:10:53.341 --> 00:10:55.050
<v Speaker 1>connections that takes time.</v>

282
00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:56.730
<v Speaker 1>And so your dad.</v>

283
00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:57.451
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

284
00:10:57.451 --> 00:10:59.670
<v Speaker 1>the thing that snake means this,</v>

285
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:04.700
<v Speaker 1>that's like three neurons super fast and so what is a snake at that level of</v>

286
00:11:07.171 --> 00:11:08.010
<v Speaker 1>representation?</v>

287
00:11:08.011 --> 00:11:12.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like a snake is that which makes you do this and then you could also say</v>

288
00:11:12.211 --> 00:11:14.010
<v Speaker 1>that at that level of representation,</v>

289
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.680
<v Speaker 1>everything that makes you do this is the same thing,</v>

290
00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:17.940
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

291
00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:22.940
<v Speaker 1>Because the same would be defined by the pattern that you manifest in response</v>

292
00:11:23.101 --> 00:11:23.934
<v Speaker 1>to that entity,</v>

293
00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.640
<v Speaker 1>so then your nervous system is layered very,</v>

294
00:11:26.641 --> 00:11:30.480
<v Speaker 1>very sensory layer neurological layer,</v>

295
00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:31.830
<v Speaker 1>motor layer.</v>

296
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:34.020
<v Speaker 1>As you become more complex,</v>

297
00:11:34.021 --> 00:11:38.070
<v Speaker 1>the sensory layer differentiates into the different sensory systems and the</v>

298
00:11:38.071 --> 00:11:43.071
<v Speaker 1>neurological level multiplies in terms of its potential number of connections.</v>

299
00:11:43.261 --> 00:11:47.460
<v Speaker 1>So what happens is that you can map patterns that manifest themselves in</v>

300
00:11:47.461 --> 00:11:48.990
<v Speaker 1>multiple different ways,</v>

301
00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:52.740
<v Speaker 1>in multiple different ways to multiple motor outputs.</v>

302
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:54.760
<v Speaker 1>So you start with a fixed action pattern,</v>

303
00:11:54.761 --> 00:11:55.740
<v Speaker 1>which is just like this.</v>

304
00:11:56.180 --> 00:12:00.910
<v Speaker 1>The the sponge reflects what's the world to a sponge.</v>

305
00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:03.970
<v Speaker 1>The world is what makes you go like this or like that.</v>

306
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:04.863
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

307
00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:06.010
<v Speaker 1>That's the whole world.</v>

308
00:12:06.011 --> 00:12:09.430
<v Speaker 1>The sponge has compressed the entire world into pores,</v>

309
00:12:09.431 --> 00:12:10.390
<v Speaker 1>open pores closed.</v>

310
00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:11.030
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

311
00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:12.370
<v Speaker 1>that's it to states.</v>

312
00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:17.830
<v Speaker 1>And then once the nervous system gets differentiated and the senses get</v>

313
00:12:17.831 --> 00:12:18.670
<v Speaker 1>differentiated,</v>

314
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.770
<v Speaker 1>so there's specialized kinds of cells,</v>

315
00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:25.120
<v Speaker 1>then you can detect more forms of patterns.</v>

316
00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:29.350
<v Speaker 1>You can produce more patterned output to that,</v>

317
00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.030
<v Speaker 1>but even more interestingly,</v>

318
00:12:31.031 --> 00:12:33.850
<v Speaker 1>and this is where the nervous system starts to come into play,</v>

319
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:38.170
<v Speaker 1>the mapping of the pattern onto the output is no longer one to one.</v>

320
00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:41.020
<v Speaker 1>You can use the same pattern roughly speaking to British,</v>

321
00:12:41.021 --> 00:12:44.800
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of different outputs that are context dependent because you might say,</v>

322
00:12:44.801 --> 00:12:45.634
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

323
00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:50.990
<v Speaker 1>so okay,</v>

324
00:12:50.991 --> 00:12:52.040
<v Speaker 1>I picked that up and you say,</v>

325
00:12:52.041 --> 00:12:52.221
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

326
00:12:52.221 --> 00:12:52.940
<v Speaker 1>he picked that up.</v>

327
00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:53.301
<v Speaker 1>It's okay.</v>

328
00:12:53.301 --> 00:12:54.470
<v Speaker 1>Well what about that?</v>

329
00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:57.071
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>

330
00:12:57.071 --> 00:12:57.191
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

331
00:12:57.191 --> 00:12:57.761
<v Speaker 1>he picked it up.</v>

332
00:12:57.761 --> 00:12:57.941
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

333
00:12:57.941 --> 00:12:58.351
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

334
00:12:58.351 --> 00:12:58.541
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

335
00:12:58.541 --> 00:12:58.871
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

336
00:12:58.871 --> 00:13:03.871
<v Speaker 1>Except that the pattern of musculature that I used to do this is by no means</v>

337
00:13:05.141 --> 00:13:08.050
<v Speaker 1>identical to the pattern of musculature that I used to do that.</v>

338
00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:08.530
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

339
00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:11.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean the fact that the orientation is different is actually extraordinarily</v>

340
00:13:11.741 --> 00:13:12.574
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

341
00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:13.563
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

342
00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:15.303
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

343
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:15.941
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

344
00:13:15.941 --> 00:13:16.591
<v Speaker 1>my point is,</v>

345
00:13:16.591 --> 00:13:17.424
<v Speaker 1>is that right?</v>

346
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:21.290
<v Speaker 1>We're sufficient nervous complexity.</v>

347
00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:23.810
<v Speaker 1>You can take the same thing,</v>

348
00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:27.560
<v Speaker 1>so to speak and map it all sorts of different ways and human beings are</v>

349
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:29.420
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably good at that.</v>

350
00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:29.991
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

351
00:13:29.991 --> 00:13:33.020
<v Speaker 1>so now go back to when things were simple.</v>

352
00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:37.010
<v Speaker 1>So there's single celled organisms will say,</v>

353
00:13:37.011 --> 00:13:40.460
<v Speaker 1>and then they start to differentiate to some degree and they start to propagate</v>

354
00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:45.050
<v Speaker 1>and so then there's the environment starts to shift because the fact of the</v>

355
00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:49.160
<v Speaker 1>prevalence of all of these competitors means the environment isn't exactly the</v>

356
00:13:49.161 --> 00:13:51.920
<v Speaker 1>same as it was when that system first evolved,</v>

357
00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:56.030
<v Speaker 1>new problems emerge and so then there's selection pressure on those creatures to</v>

358
00:13:56.031 --> 00:14:00.200
<v Speaker 1>diversify to some degree and then the diversification produces a transformation</v>

359
00:14:00.201 --> 00:14:04.490
<v Speaker 1>in the environment and then there's pressure on those new entities to diversify</v>

360
00:14:04.491 --> 00:14:05.031
<v Speaker 1>some more.</v>

361
00:14:05.031 --> 00:14:07.610
<v Speaker 1>And so you get this weird bootstrapping process.</v>

362
00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:10.970
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the environment is one thing when there's 10 of you,</v>

363
00:14:10.971 --> 00:14:13.370
<v Speaker 1>but a completely different thing when there's a thousand of you.</v>

364
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:14.451
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

365
00:14:14.451 --> 00:14:17.510
<v Speaker 1>So just sheer multiplication is going to transform the environment.</v>

366
00:14:17.511 --> 00:14:19.130
<v Speaker 1>And so then the.</v>

367
00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:23.240
<v Speaker 1>Because the environment has now become more complex than it was their selection</v>

368
00:14:23.241 --> 00:14:26.930
<v Speaker 1>pressure to produce diversification in the underlying organisms.</v>

369
00:14:26.931 --> 00:14:29.210
<v Speaker 1>And that took a long time to get off the ground.</v>

370
00:14:29.211 --> 00:14:33.590
<v Speaker 1>Like there were single celled organisms for a huge span of history.</v>

371
00:14:33.591 --> 00:14:34.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

372
00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:36.020
<v Speaker 1>if you look at evolutionary history,</v>

373
00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:40.820
<v Speaker 1>the amount of time that there were single celled organisms is far longer than</v>

374
00:14:40.821 --> 00:14:43.390
<v Speaker 1>the time that there's been since the remotely celled organisms.</v>

375
00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.350
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's like Moore's law.</v>

376
00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:47.760
<v Speaker 1>You know the law that governs the,</v>

377
00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.520
<v Speaker 1>the increase in computational power.</v>

378
00:14:49.521 --> 00:14:52.510
<v Speaker 1>You can trace that back to about the year $1,400,</v>

379
00:14:52.511 --> 00:14:53.344
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

380
00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:57.020
<v Speaker 1>So it's been going on for a very long time and maybe you could make the same</v>

381
00:14:57.021 --> 00:14:58.610
<v Speaker 1>case from an evolutionary perspective.</v>

382
00:14:58.611 --> 00:15:01.610
<v Speaker 1>It's like the flat part of the curve is really long,</v>

383
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:03.080
<v Speaker 1>but once it starts to move up,</v>

384
00:15:03.081 --> 00:15:06.830
<v Speaker 1>it starts to move up really fast and obviously that's the position that we're in</v>

385
00:15:06.831 --> 00:15:07.520
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

386
00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:10.040
<v Speaker 1>So single celled organisms for a long time.</v>

387
00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:13.280
<v Speaker 1>Then they started to diversify and then you could imagine,</v>

388
00:15:13.281 --> 00:15:14.114
<v Speaker 1>well</v>

389
00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:16.640
<v Speaker 1>from the single cell organism,</v>

390
00:15:16.641 --> 00:15:19.940
<v Speaker 1>you start getting multicellular organism and then it ends up with this</v>

391
00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:21.320
<v Speaker 1>tripartite structure,</v>

392
00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:22.640
<v Speaker 1>sensory layer,</v>

393
00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:23.540
<v Speaker 1>nervous layer,</v>

394
00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:24.943
<v Speaker 1>motor layer,</v>

395
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:29.480
<v Speaker 1>and then that starts to differentiate and every time there's a differentiation</v>

396
00:15:29.481 --> 00:15:32.900
<v Speaker 1>that's conserved and that's these systems.</v>

397
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.370
<v Speaker 1>The motivational systems.</v>

398
00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:36.290
<v Speaker 1>He emerged a long,</v>

399
00:15:36.291 --> 00:15:41.291
<v Speaker 1>long time ago as emergent solutions to emergent problems and you've conserved</v>

400
00:15:41.721 --> 00:15:42.320
<v Speaker 1>all of them.</v>

401
00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean you've conserved your snake reflex,</v>

402
00:15:44.721 --> 00:15:47.180
<v Speaker 1>which is like three neurons long,</v>

403
00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:48.771
<v Speaker 1>so that's really,</v>

404
00:15:48.771 --> 00:15:49.760
<v Speaker 1>really primordial,</v>

405
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.080
<v Speaker 1>but you've conserved,</v>

406
00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.320
<v Speaker 1>you've conserved function at almost every temporal level,</v>

407
00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:59.360
<v Speaker 1>so there's parts of you that are quick and dirty and parts of you that are slow</v>

408
00:15:59.361 --> 00:16:04.100
<v Speaker 1>and sophisticated and a lot of the contents of consciousness is slow and</v>

409
00:16:04.101 --> 00:16:04.934
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated,</v>

410
00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:07.040
<v Speaker 1>so it can't help you out in an emergency,</v>

411
00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:11.180
<v Speaker 1>but it can do or consciousness seems to do is take your structure,</v>

412
00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:14.400
<v Speaker 1>it analyzes the world's for,</v>

413
00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:15.253
<v Speaker 1>for let's say,</v>

414
00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.110
<v Speaker 1>mismatches between what you want and what's happening,</v>

415
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:23.120
<v Speaker 1>and then it either helps you alter the world so those mismatches go away or it</v>

416
00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:24.090
<v Speaker 1>turns inward.</v>

417
00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:27.320
<v Speaker 1>Ma modifies the structures that you're using.</v>

418
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:29.450
<v Speaker 1>So if you're playing the piano,</v>

419
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:33.680
<v Speaker 1>you've got this automatized routine has very little to do with consciousness.</v>

420
00:16:33.681 --> 00:16:35.810
<v Speaker 1>If you've practiced enough and you make a mistake,</v>

421
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:39.410
<v Speaker 1>you stop and you note the mistake,</v>

422
00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:43.940
<v Speaker 1>you stop and then you slow it down and then you read.</v>

423
00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:46.310
<v Speaker 1>You practice the new thing.</v>

424
00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:47.511
<v Speaker 1>Then you speed it up.</v>

425
00:16:47.511 --> 00:16:48.290
<v Speaker 1>Then you speed it up,</v>

426
00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:50.180
<v Speaker 1>then you speed it up and as you're doing that,</v>

427
00:16:50.181 --> 00:16:54.110
<v Speaker 1>the neural representation shrinks until you've developed this little specialized</v>

428
00:16:54.111 --> 00:16:57.500
<v Speaker 1>machine and then you run that a few times and now you can ignore it.</v>

429
00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:00.350
<v Speaker 1>You can look at the notes and just play and away you go,</v>

430
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:02.810
<v Speaker 1>and that's kind of what consciousness is doing all the time.</v>

431
00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:08.140
<v Speaker 1>You're laying out an automatized routine and then if,</v>

432
00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:11.420
<v Speaker 1>if that doesn't produce the intended outcome,</v>

433
00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:12.590
<v Speaker 1>you stop.</v>

434
00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:16.370
<v Speaker 1>You become conscious really because nothing like an error to make you conscious.</v>

435
00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:21.940
<v Speaker 1>Then you do a high resolution analysis of the space in which the error emerged.</v>

436
00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:25.220
<v Speaker 1>You rematch your motor output,</v>

437
00:17:25.221 --> 00:17:29.390
<v Speaker 1>your perceptions and all of that to make that error go away in a way you go and</v>

438
00:17:29.391 --> 00:17:31.160
<v Speaker 1>so your consciousness is continually.</v>

439
00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:35.240
<v Speaker 1>Your consciousness seems to be continually building your unconscious,</v>

440
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:37.280
<v Speaker 1>your procedural unconscious,</v>

441
00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:38.600
<v Speaker 1>and so to some degree,</v>

442
00:17:38.601 --> 00:17:42.890
<v Speaker 1>the purpose of consciousness is to make you functional unconsciously,</v>

443
00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:44.091
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

444
00:17:44.091 --> 00:17:45.080
<v Speaker 1>Because that's way better.</v>

445
00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:47.600
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to be conscious if most things because it's just,</v>

446
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:48.261
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do?</v>

447
00:17:48.261 --> 00:17:50.120
<v Speaker 1>Be Conscious of your digestive processes.</v>

448
00:17:50.121 --> 00:17:50.740
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

449
00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:51.573
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

450
00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:53.720
<v Speaker 1>if you're good at something,</v>

451
00:17:53.721 --> 00:17:55.580
<v Speaker 1>you hardly have to be conscious of it at all.</v>

452
00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:55.820
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
