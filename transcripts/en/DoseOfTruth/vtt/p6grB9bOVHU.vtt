1
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:07.780
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2
00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.400
<v Speaker 1>so the Mecca Medina distinction seems to be jury,</v>

3
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.990
<v Speaker 1>I would say both complicated and problematic because,</v>

4
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.273
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

5
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:17.870
<v Speaker 1>so t tell me if I'm wrong.</v>

6
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:18.261
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

7
00:00:18.261 --> 00:00:23.261
<v Speaker 1>Because my understanding is that Mohammed spent most of the part of his life</v>

8
00:00:24.021 --> 00:00:29.021
<v Speaker 1>that was associated with the establishment of Islam in Medina and northern neck.</v>

9
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.890
<v Speaker 1>And that it wasn't until he went to Medina that Islam actually became a force.</v>

10
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.200
<v Speaker 1>So back in Mecca,</v>

11
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.910
<v Speaker 1>although his doctrine appears to have been,</v>

12
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:38.331
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

13
00:00:38.331 --> 00:00:39.164
<v Speaker 1>more peaceful,</v>

14
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.480
<v Speaker 1>it was also much less successful as a,</v>

15
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.030
<v Speaker 1>as a both a religious and a political movement.</v>

16
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.620
<v Speaker 1>So then he left Mecca and I believe under pressure from the inhabitants,</v>

17
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:49.850
<v Speaker 1>at least to some degree,</v>

18
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.020
<v Speaker 1>moved to Medina.</v>

19
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.720
<v Speaker 1>And then that's when Islam became more,</v>

20
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:54.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.850
<v Speaker 1>more rep,</v>

22
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.260
<v Speaker 1>more revolutionary and expansive.</v>

23
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.070
<v Speaker 1>And so what do you see now I know that it isn't universally accepted among the</v>

24
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.360
<v Speaker 1>Islamic community that that Mecca Medina distinction is a reasonable one to make</v>

25
00:01:08.361 --> 00:01:12.140
<v Speaker 1>because of course the presumption is that there's an essential unity of thought</v>

26
00:01:12.141 --> 00:01:13.310
<v Speaker 1>across the doctrines.</v>

27
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:14.653
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

28
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.153
<v Speaker 1>but given,</v>

29
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.180
<v Speaker 1>given your interpretation and I've read the a similar interpretation among</v>

30
00:01:20.181 --> 00:01:20.600
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

31
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.560
<v Speaker 1>among other people,</v>

32
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.300
<v Speaker 1>do you see,</v>

33
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.590
<v Speaker 1>what do you see as hopeful within the Islamic community with regards to bridging</v>

34
00:01:27.591 --> 00:01:32.591
<v Speaker 1>the gap between the say the earlier works so to speak of Mohammed and the later,</v>

35
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.883
<v Speaker 1>the later more,</v>

36
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.140
<v Speaker 1>more revolutionary element of the,</v>

37
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.610
<v Speaker 1>of his actions and his faith.</v>

38
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.710
<v Speaker 1>Is there a way that that can be reconciled?</v>

39
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.421
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

40
00:01:41.421 --> 00:01:44.900
<v Speaker 2>so dividing of Muslims into Mecca,</v>

41
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.063
<v Speaker 2>a set of Mecca,</v>

42
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.780
<v Speaker 2>Medina and modifiers,</v>

43
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.020
<v Speaker 2>that's not of course an official this thing except that anyone really wants to</v>

44
00:01:54.831 --> 00:01:56.030
<v Speaker 2>give to you know who,</v>

45
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.380
<v Speaker 2>which individuals,</v>

46
00:01:57.381 --> 00:01:58.910
<v Speaker 2>which Muslims uh,</v>

47
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.230
<v Speaker 2>at war with us.</v>

48
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.090
<v Speaker 2>And should we be worried about what about peaceful Muslim?</v>

49
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.190
<v Speaker 2>What about these other Muslims who are speaking up?</v>

50
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.431
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

51
00:02:07.431 --> 00:02:09.680
<v Speaker 2>what kind of labels we will give him.</v>

52
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.850
<v Speaker 2>If you said the word Islam most</v>

53
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.183
<v Speaker 2>as a Muslim,</v>

54
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.520
<v Speaker 2>what was the last thing that I look is that selected and in their selection who</v>

55
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.240
<v Speaker 2>justify their,</v>

56
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.580
<v Speaker 2>actually they said both methods.</v>

57
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.820
<v Speaker 2>Alondra to legacy in Mecca.</v>

58
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:29.960
<v Speaker 2>Because as I was,</v>

59
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.870
<v Speaker 2>if my sister tells me you've missed the pair,</v>

60
00:02:33.871 --> 00:02:35.240
<v Speaker 2>you need to get up and say,</v>

61
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:36.440
<v Speaker 2>I was involved,</v>

62
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.850
<v Speaker 2>some of us for my parents say,</v>

63
00:02:37.851 --> 00:02:42.370
<v Speaker 2>oh come on my relationship with a lot these intimate and unique,</v>

64
00:02:42.371 --> 00:02:44.930
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's none of your business to tell him what to do.</v>

65
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.660
<v Speaker 2>And then she would come up with some other or some other Thursday.</v>

66
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.760
<v Speaker 2>But it's my easy to command and hold on,</v>

67
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

68
00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.530
<v Speaker 2>But then the lithium was going to extent underused Decisely and I'm not the only</v>

69
00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:05.440
<v Speaker 2>one the other scholars like and that there are many other scholars</v>

70
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.050
<v Speaker 2>who needs to see a window piece.</v>

71
00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.070
<v Speaker 2>I think his mom.</v>

72
00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.020
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

73
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.853
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

74
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.140
<v Speaker 2>Additional or the culture as a civilization and at the same time putting to ban</v>

75
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:20.910
<v Speaker 2>this violin,</v>

76
00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.310
<v Speaker 2>providing courses within Islam.</v>

77
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.160
<v Speaker 2>Try and do that.</v>

78
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.550
<v Speaker 2>Then you'll go to see your work to make a list of all the concepts</v>

79
00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.720
<v Speaker 2>that we really don't have any problem with people being told to pay five times a</v>

80
00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:45.520
<v Speaker 2>day or is this letter or in the [inaudible] and all sorts of,</v>

81
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

82
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.530
<v Speaker 2>religious features I think don't have a problem.</v>

83
00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.810
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

84
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:50.141
<v Speaker 2>all of,</v>

85
00:03:50.141 --> 00:03:50.980
<v Speaker 2>that's what they did.</v>

86
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.740
<v Speaker 2>That's the Mecca and Medina,</v>

87
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:54.603
<v Speaker 2>as you said,</v>

88
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.650
<v Speaker 2>a political philosophy.</v>

89
00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:57.560
<v Speaker 2>They're dishonest.</v>

90
00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.450
<v Speaker 2>And the literacy Muhammad,</v>

91
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.860
<v Speaker 2>we just them and that's,</v>

92
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.080
<v Speaker 2>and that's exactly when it was loud.</v>

93
00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:06.060
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

94
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm successful and this is just today I tried to end it in and they say</v>

95
00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.513
<v Speaker 2>Paul</v>

96
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:17.403
<v Speaker 3>to be</v>

97
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.610
<v Speaker 2>what to be emulating.</v>

98
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.460
<v Speaker 2>So that's I think where you were saying,</v>

99
00:04:23.461 --> 00:04:24.294
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

100
00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.070
<v Speaker 2>the neck of the unit and Poker Martha</v>

101
00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.830
<v Speaker 2>classification that we applied social sciences has its problems.</v>

102
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.300
<v Speaker 2>But this was sort of simplifies because it focuses oh,</v>

103
00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.920
<v Speaker 2>after you should what it should.</v>

104
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.441
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

105
00:04:41.441 --> 00:04:43.810
<v Speaker 1>So you see this as an externally applied,</v>

106
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:45.123
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

107
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

108
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.140
<v Speaker 1>a category system essentially useful that's useful for,</v>

109
00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.393
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

110
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.460
<v Speaker 1>for outsiders who are trying to assess the situation to determine who it is that</v>

111
00:04:57.431 --> 00:05:00.670
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with that might be regarded as an ally and who it is that you're</v>

112
00:05:00.671 --> 00:05:01.091
<v Speaker 1>dealing with.</v>

113
00:05:01.091 --> 00:05:02.520
<v Speaker 1>It might be regarded as a fault,</v>

114
00:05:02.521 --> 00:05:03.191
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

115
00:05:03.191 --> 00:05:05.510
<v Speaker 1>And that would be on the more militant end of things is that,</v>

116
00:05:05.511 --> 00:05:05.910
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

117
00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.200
<v Speaker 1>that that's a reasonable way of looking at it.</v>

118
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:10.370
<v Speaker 2>That's reasonable.</v>

119
00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:11.750
<v Speaker 2>That's a reasonable way of looking at it.</v>

120
00:05:11.751 --> 00:05:15.620
<v Speaker 2>But also if you take the moderate versus extreme classification or</v>

121
00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.430
<v Speaker 2>categorization that has become common placed,</v>

122
00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.590
<v Speaker 2>it does is tell you what,</v>

123
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.050
<v Speaker 2>when we look at that model,</v>

124
00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.000
<v Speaker 2>we think of people who are not using by us.</v>

125
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.770
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>

126
00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:27.910
<v Speaker 2>if you look at Medina,</v>

127
00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:33.340
<v Speaker 2>you will see that there are hundreds of thousands of Muslims who do not apply</v>

128
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.240
<v Speaker 2>violence now,</v>

129
00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.580
<v Speaker 2>but who do preach about and they do move peach,</v>

130
00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.240
<v Speaker 2>the Makino legacies and they believe it should be.</v>

131
00:05:41.241 --> 00:05:42.590
<v Speaker 2>It should be instituted.</v>

132
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:44.450
<v Speaker 2>And in places where the guests,</v>

133
00:05:44.451 --> 00:05:46.490
<v Speaker 2>where you get a majority of these,</v>

134
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.600
<v Speaker 2>none of violence and the types,</v>

135
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.270
<v Speaker 2>the center,</v>

136
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.640
<v Speaker 2>this has applied and forces we alone.</v>

137
00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.850
<v Speaker 2>So I think that the toms model is an extreme.</v>

138
00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:57.710
<v Speaker 2>I just was not good enough.</v>

139
00:05:57.711 --> 00:05:59.980
<v Speaker 2>They don't cover the well and they also don't,</v>

140
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.010
<v Speaker 2>they don't also seem to bear any relationship to the internal diet dynamics of</v>

141
00:06:04.011 --> 00:06:05.000
<v Speaker 2>the faith itself.</v>

142
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.620
<v Speaker 2>So that that's also problematic.</v>

143
00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:07.491
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

144
00:06:07.491 --> 00:06:09.500
<v Speaker 2>so does that,</v>

145
00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:12.650
