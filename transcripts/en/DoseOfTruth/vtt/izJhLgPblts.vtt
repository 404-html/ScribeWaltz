1
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.150
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that's really interesting about psychoanalysis,</v>

2
00:00:10.151 --> 00:00:14.530
<v Speaker 1>so one of the things I love about it is that psychoanalyst tell you if someone</v>

3
00:00:14.531 --> 00:00:16.660
<v Speaker 1>says I'm good,</v>

4
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:18.010
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

5
00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.660
<v Speaker 1>or I stand for a good thing,</v>

6
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.480
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you want to look for is the opposite of that.</v>

7
00:00:22.481 --> 00:00:22.781
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

8
00:00:22.781 --> 00:00:23.051
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

9
00:00:23.051 --> 00:00:24.520
<v Speaker 1>that's what you say.</v>

10
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.130
<v Speaker 1>What might really be going on?</v>

11
00:00:27.131 --> 00:00:30.760
<v Speaker 1>Or is it actually the case that you're Jesus Christ and all the saints combined?</v>

12
00:00:30.761 --> 00:00:31.031
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

13
00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:35.800
<v Speaker 1>you're this perfect person or there are there dark motives for what you're doing</v>

14
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.260
<v Speaker 1>that you claim to be doing for the good.</v>

15
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.480
<v Speaker 1>So guy named George Orwell,</v>

16
00:00:40.481 --> 00:00:43.820
<v Speaker 1>who was one of the world's most creative essayists in,</v>

17
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:44.290
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

18
00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.150
<v Speaker 1>in this in the 20th century,</v>

19
00:00:46.151 --> 00:00:46.541
<v Speaker 1>he was a,</v>

20
00:00:46.541 --> 00:00:47.560
<v Speaker 1>he was a left winger.</v>

21
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.840
<v Speaker 1>He wrote some things that were very criticism,</v>

22
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.750
<v Speaker 1>critical of socialist movements and what did,</v>

23
00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:56.751
<v Speaker 1>it was one of the early critics of of Soviet Russia when it was sort of in vogue</v>

24
00:00:58.451 --> 00:01:00.970
<v Speaker 1>among intellectuals to be supportive of the Soviets.</v>

25
00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.660
<v Speaker 1>One of the things he said about left wing socialist was that they didn't really</v>

26
00:01:04.661 --> 00:01:05.440
<v Speaker 1>like the poor.</v>

27
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.730
<v Speaker 1>He was talking about middle class,</v>

28
00:01:06.731 --> 00:01:07.750
<v Speaker 1>left wing socialist,</v>

29
00:01:07.751 --> 00:01:10.630
<v Speaker 1>not the working class guys who were in unions and you know,</v>

30
00:01:10.631 --> 00:01:14.980
<v Speaker 1>had some justification for their struggle against those who are at the top of</v>

31
00:01:14.981 --> 00:01:18.160
<v Speaker 1>the power hierarchy was more looking at people that were already at the top of</v>

32
00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:19.090
<v Speaker 1>the power hierarchy,</v>

33
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.000
<v Speaker 1>who are claiming to be advocates for the working class.</v>

34
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

35
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.930
<v Speaker 1>and his claim fundamentally was that those people didn't like the poor.</v>

36
00:01:25.931 --> 00:01:27.250
<v Speaker 1>They just hated the rich.</v>

37
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.941
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

38
00:01:27.941 --> 00:01:29.110
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>

39
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.310
<v Speaker 1>it was difficult for the publisher who was publishing that book,</v>

40
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.360
<v Speaker 1>which was called</v>

41
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:35.653
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

42
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.480
<v Speaker 1>Road to Wigan pier,</v>

43
00:01:38.481 --> 00:01:39.590
<v Speaker 1>which is an amazing book.</v>

44
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.570
<v Speaker 1>It's a book about coal miners in northern,</v>

45
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.220
<v Speaker 1>in northern Britain and it's,</v>

46
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.881
<v Speaker 1>it's brutal.</v>

47
00:01:43.881 --> 00:01:45.170
<v Speaker 1>Those people at brutal lives,</v>

48
00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:45.770
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

49
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:46.603
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

50
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.533
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>

51
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:48.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

52
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.850
<v Speaker 1>the publisher,</v>

54
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.050
<v Speaker 1>which was the left book club,</v>

55
00:01:51.051 --> 00:01:52.040
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>

56
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.570
<v Speaker 1>was very low to publish the essay that went along with that book because it was</v>

57
00:01:56.571 --> 00:02:00.650
<v Speaker 1>such a devastating criticism of sort of middleclass socialism anyways.</v>

58
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.310
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

59
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.230
<v Speaker 1>so the psychoanalysts are always telling you,</v>

60
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:04.131
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

61
00:02:04.131 --> 00:02:04.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

62
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.570
<v Speaker 1>there you are,</v>

63
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:06.800
<v Speaker 1>there's no monster.</v>

64
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:07.491
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

65
00:02:07.491 --> 00:02:07.761
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

66
00:02:07.761 --> 00:02:08.571
<v Speaker 1>where's the monster?</v>

67
00:02:08.571 --> 00:02:09.680
<v Speaker 1>Because it's somewhere,</v>

68
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.670
<v Speaker 1>it's somewhere because there's a monster in everyone.</v>

69
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.800
<v Speaker 1>And if you're hiding it or covering it up or pretending that you know,</v>

70
00:02:15.801 --> 00:02:17.120
<v Speaker 1>you only stand for the good.</v>

71
00:02:17.121 --> 00:02:20.630
<v Speaker 1>It's like all that means is that you're ignorant and naive about your own</v>

72
00:02:20.631 --> 00:02:21.261
<v Speaker 1>possibility.</v>

73
00:02:21.261 --> 00:02:22.910
<v Speaker 1>There's a monster around there somewhere.</v>

74
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.073
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

75
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.731
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

76
00:02:25.731 --> 00:02:26.600
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly because,</v>

77
00:02:26.601 --> 00:02:26.871
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

78
00:02:26.871 --> 00:02:27.740
<v Speaker 1>if you're not a monster,</v>

79
00:02:27.741 --> 00:02:30.500
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty hard to stay alive because you know,</v>

80
00:02:30.501 --> 00:02:32.390
<v Speaker 1>you have to contend with things like this,</v>

81
00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:35.440
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

82
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.060
<v Speaker 1>things like this and things like this and things like this and things like this,</v>

83
00:02:40.061 --> 00:02:40.361
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

84
00:02:40.361 --> 00:02:41.194
<v Speaker 1>that's your life.</v>

85
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.300
<v Speaker 1>You contend with that nature is brutal.</v>

86
00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.500
<v Speaker 1>Culture is brutal,</v>

87
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.480
<v Speaker 1>and other people can be brutal too.</v>

88
00:02:46.481 --> 00:02:49.990
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're not prepared for that and able to withstand it,</v>

89
00:02:49.991 --> 00:02:51.490
<v Speaker 1>then you're just going to get rolled over.</v>

90
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.120
<v Speaker 1>So you better get the old inner monster developed because,</v>

91
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.780
<v Speaker 1>and under conscious control because even though it's a terrible thing,</v>

92
00:02:58.781 --> 00:02:59.380
<v Speaker 1>you need it.</v>
