00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.153
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't think my wife loves are</v>
<v Speaker 2>internationally adopted daughter and she</v>

3
00:00:11.471 --> 00:00:15.400
<v Speaker 2>won't go to counseling with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My house is filled with tyranny and</v>

4
00:00:15.401 --> 00:00:16.930
<v Speaker 2>anger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any advice?</v>

5
00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.810
<v Speaker 2>Anonymous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>

6
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.210
<v Speaker 2>that's a loaded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a set of loaded questions,</v>

7
00:00:37.211 --> 00:00:39.400
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think my wife loves are</v>

8
00:00:39.401 --> 00:00:43.030
<v Speaker 2>internationally adopted daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

9
00:00:43.031 --> 00:00:48.031
<v Speaker 2>the first question would be why not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was she in on the adoption,</v>

10
00:00:48.071 --> 00:00:50.110
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was it partly her decision?</v>

11
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.070
<v Speaker 2>Here's a possibility.</v>

12
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.050
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you could ask her under what</v>
<v Speaker 2>conditions.</v>

13
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.570
<v Speaker 2>Ask her more specifically why she</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't like your internationally</v>

14
00:01:07.571 --> 00:01:10.480
<v Speaker 2>adopted daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too vague.</v>

15
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't think my wife loves are</v>
<v Speaker 2>internationally adopted daughter.</v>

16
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.500
<v Speaker 2>Break it down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's something like there are 15</v>

17
00:01:17.501 --> 00:01:21.850
<v Speaker 2>things about our life with our</v>
<v Speaker 2>internationally adopted daughter that my</v>

18
00:01:21.851 --> 00:01:24.850
<v Speaker 2>wife does not appreciate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now maybe some of those things are the</v>

19
00:01:24.851 --> 00:01:27.730
<v Speaker 2>way that the daughter behaves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how old she is or anything</v>

20
00:01:27.731 --> 00:01:32.650
<v Speaker 2>else about her and</v>
<v Speaker 2>differentiate your problem.</v>

21
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.860
<v Speaker 2>It's too vague.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll never solve it this way because</v>

22
00:01:35.861 --> 00:01:39.700
<v Speaker 2>love isn't the right word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See if you can write down 30 reasons why</v>

23
00:01:39.701 --> 00:01:44.110
<v Speaker 2>your wife is annoyed about your current</v>
<v Speaker 2>situation and maybe you'll have to</v>

24
00:01:44.111 --> 00:01:46.600
<v Speaker 2>differentiate each of those 30 into 10</v>
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>

25
00:01:46.601 --> 00:01:49.150
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there's 300 reasons and then see</v>

26
00:01:49.151 --> 00:01:54.151
<v Speaker 2>if you can start asking her about fixing</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the reasons that you</v>

27
00:01:54.251 --> 00:01:57.850
<v Speaker 2>differentiate it because obviously you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't go up to her and say you have to</v>

28
00:01:57.851 --> 00:02:01.630
<v Speaker 2>start loving are internationally adopted</v>
<v Speaker 2>daughter that's just not gonna work and</v>

29
00:02:01.631 --> 00:02:06.631
<v Speaker 2>you already know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you break that down into the 20</v>

30
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.070
<v Speaker 2>reasons why she doesn't like your</v>
<v Speaker 2>daughter,</v>

31
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:14.320
<v Speaker 2>then maybe you can figure out a way that</v>
<v Speaker 2>some progress might be made on one of</v>

32
00:02:14.321 --> 00:02:17.500
<v Speaker 2>those problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe if you take that approach for</v>

33
00:02:17.501 --> 00:02:21.250
<v Speaker 2>a whole year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then she'll go from like,</v>

34
00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.000
<v Speaker 2>she'll at least hit neutral or something</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

35
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:26.363
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

36
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.840
<v Speaker 2>that's the best I can do given that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>only have three sentences to go on.</v>

37
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.220
<v Speaker 2>So differentiate the problem and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>solve the smaller problems.</v>
