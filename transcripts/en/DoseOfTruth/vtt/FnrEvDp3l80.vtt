00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.050
<v Speaker 1>Don't underestimate the significance of the birth control pill.</v>

2
00:00:13.051 --> 00:00:15.930
<v Speaker 1>It's like the hydrogen bomb or the or the computer chip.</v>

3
00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:20.931
<v Speaker 1>It's a world revolutionary technology and for all we know it might do us in,</v>

4
00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:21.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:22.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean in the West,</v>

6
00:00:22.861 --> 00:00:26.010
<v Speaker 1>the birth rate is far below replacement and you know,</v>

7
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.050
<v Speaker 1>that's as a,</v>

8
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.280
<v Speaker 1>has a multigenerational strategy.</v>

9
00:00:29.281 --> 00:00:29.880
<v Speaker 1>That's just,</v>

10
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.230
<v Speaker 1>that's an absolute dead end.</v>

11
00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:32.064
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>

12
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.810
<v Speaker 1>no one can talk about that because,</v>

13
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.670
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

14
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:35.070
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

15
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.420
<v Speaker 1>for obvious the obvious reasons of egalitarianism and diversity and all that,</v>

16
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.440
<v Speaker 1>but the declining birth rate and the West is really,</v>

17
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.030
<v Speaker 1>I would say a,</v>

18
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.523
<v Speaker 1>a catastrophe.</v>

19
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to be one of those people that you think the planet has too many</v>

20
00:00:50.131 --> 00:00:50.780
<v Speaker 1>people on it,</v>

21
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:51.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.043
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

23
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.240
<v Speaker 1>um.</v>
