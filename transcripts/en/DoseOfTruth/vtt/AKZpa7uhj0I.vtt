00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:03.463
<v Speaker 1>Hm</v>

2
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.010
<v Speaker 2>probability of a collapse is proportional to the number of events or curry.</v>

3
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.540
<v Speaker 2>And so the more events occur,</v>

4
00:00:18.541 --> 00:00:21.900
<v Speaker 2>the more likely extremely unlikely events are to take place.</v>

5
00:00:21.901 --> 00:00:23.550
<v Speaker 2>And everything's been speeding up,</v>

6
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.050
<v Speaker 2>really speeding up.</v>

7
00:00:25.051 --> 00:00:25.321
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

8
00:00:25.321 --> 00:00:28.860
<v Speaker 2>you think about how many trades now are made in microseconds by computer,</v>

9
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.671
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

10
00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:34.671
<v Speaker 2>so my suspicions are if you calculated the complexity of the trading system and</v>

11
00:00:36.031 --> 00:00:39.330
<v Speaker 2>held that constant that the rate of failure would be about the same.</v>

12
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.430
<v Speaker 2>It seems to be highly problem.</v>

13
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.001
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

14
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:44.860
<v Speaker 2>it would really surprise me if that wasn't the case because that's basically how</v>

15
00:00:44.861 --> 00:00:46.140
<v Speaker 2>systems work.</v>

16
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:46.590
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

17
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.180
<v Speaker 2>there's a certain number of events that are outliers per certain number of</v>

18
00:00:51.181 --> 00:00:51.810
<v Speaker 2>events.</v>

19
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.340
<v Speaker 2>So if you raise the number of events,</v>

20
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.750
<v Speaker 2>you raise that number of outliers.</v>

21
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.650
<v Speaker 2>And so I,</v>

22
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:56.311
<v Speaker 2>and you see this,</v>

23
00:00:56.311 --> 00:01:00.390
<v Speaker 2>I think also reflected in things like tech company growth in collapse.</v>

24
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:01.643
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

25
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.580
<v Speaker 2>20 years ago,</v>

26
00:01:02.581 --> 00:01:04.590
<v Speaker 2>the average lifespan of a company,</v>

27
00:01:04.591 --> 00:01:05.100
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

28
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.431
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

29
00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:08.580
<v Speaker 2>perhaps something around 30 to 40 years.</v>

30
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.310
<v Speaker 2>My suspicions are now that on average,</v>

31
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.020
<v Speaker 2>especially in fast changing fields,</v>

32
00:01:13.021 --> 00:01:14.310
<v Speaker 2>that they don't last that long.</v>

33
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.471
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

34
00:01:16.471 --> 00:01:17.250
<v Speaker 2>we're speeding,</v>

35
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

36
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.190
<v Speaker 2>if you think time is actually a measure of the events,</v>

37
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.570
<v Speaker 2>average number of events,</v>

38
00:01:21.571 --> 00:01:22.404
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

39
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.030
<v Speaker 2>times events are occurring a lot faster now.</v>

40
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.790
<v Speaker 2>So time in some senses sped up,</v>

41
00:01:29.791 --> 00:01:31.170
<v Speaker 2>at least in certain systems.</v>
