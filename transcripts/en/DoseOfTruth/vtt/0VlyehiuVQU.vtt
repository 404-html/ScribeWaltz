00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.370
<v Speaker 1>Your idea of realer than real appears to</v>
<v Speaker 1>parallel Plato's theory of the forms?</v>

2
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.930
<v Speaker 1>Is this the source of the idea or are</v>
<v Speaker 1>you reconsidering ancient philosophy?</v>

3
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God only knows what the source of an</v>

4
00:00:19.841 --> 00:00:21.040
<v Speaker 1>idea is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5
00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:22.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.960
<v Speaker 1>my sense of Plato's forms was it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they weren't exactly narrative</v>

7
00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:31.750
<v Speaker 1>instructure although I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that there isn't at least an</v>

8
00:00:31.751 --> 00:00:36.610
<v Speaker 1>analogous relationship between the idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>of archetype and the idea of form.</v>

9
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.870
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Plato was talking more about</v>

10
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.470
<v Speaker 1>forms of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of tangible objects in the world.</v>

11
00:00:44.471 --> 00:00:47.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I'm talking more about permanent</v>

12
00:00:47.291 --> 00:00:49.660
<v Speaker 1>patterns of behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:50.703
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

14
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.933
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

15
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.740
<v Speaker 1>what are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what our culture is essentially is a</v>

16
00:00:56.741 --> 00:01:00.610
<v Speaker 1>dance of permanent patterns of behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

17
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.590
<v Speaker 1>there's a fair bit of variability in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

18
00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.290
<v Speaker 1>in the patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there is variability in a</v>

19
00:01:05.291 --> 00:01:08.050
<v Speaker 1>basketball game or a soccer game or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

20
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's obviously predictability and</v>

21
00:01:10.271 --> 00:01:11.800
<v Speaker 1>variability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

22
00:01:11.801 --> 00:01:15.460
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the predictable elements are the,</v>

23
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.550
<v Speaker 1>are equivalent in some sense to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>platonic forms,</v>

24
00:01:18.551 --> 00:01:23.170
<v Speaker 1>which is the point that you're making</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's the discovery of those more</v>

25
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.200
<v Speaker 1>permanent forms that emerges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a consequence of the spinning of</v>

26
00:01:29.921 --> 00:01:30.820
<v Speaker 1>stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

27
00:01:30.821 --> 00:01:35.140
<v Speaker 1>because we're watching each other</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly and we're articulating what</v>

28
00:01:35.141 --> 00:01:39.490
<v Speaker 1>we see and then we're amalgamating the</v>
<v Speaker 1>articulations and we're sifting them</v>

29
00:01:39.491 --> 00:01:41.490
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for fundamental patterns.</v>

30
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.410
<v Speaker 1>Like a good example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something I just recently</v>

31
00:01:44.411 --> 00:01:46.930
<v Speaker 1>discovered when I did the biblical</v>
<v Speaker 1>lectures on Abraham.</v>

32
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:48.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

33
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.360
<v Speaker 1>I didn't understand that Abraham was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>late bloomer.</v>

34
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.250
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like the guy who stayed in his</v>

35
00:01:54.251 --> 00:01:55.960
<v Speaker 1>mother's basement for too long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

36
00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.200
<v Speaker 1>he's 75 when God calls him on an</v>
<v Speaker 1>adventure and God basically tells him to</v>

37
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.520
<v Speaker 1>leave his family and his countrymen and</v>
<v Speaker 1>his kinsmen and to go into the land of</v>

38
00:02:06.521 --> 00:02:08.500
<v Speaker 1>the stranger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

39
00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.910
<v Speaker 1>see there's an archetypal pattern there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the pattern is,</v>

40
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.990
<v Speaker 1>while it's the pattern of the call and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

41
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.020
<v Speaker 1>it's deeply,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something that people experience,</v>

42
00:02:20.021 --> 00:02:21.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an adolescent,</v>

43
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.640
<v Speaker 1>a healthy adolescent wants to get away</v>
<v Speaker 1>from his or her stultifying,</v>

44
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

45
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.830
<v Speaker 1>dependent upbringing and go out into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world of adventure,</v>

46
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

47
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.330
<v Speaker 1>in the biblical stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts that's symbolically represented</v>

48
00:02:40.571 --> 00:02:43.060
<v Speaker 1>as something akin to a divine call,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

49
00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.760
<v Speaker 1>which I think is quite interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

50
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't understand these calls.</v>

51
00:02:48.881 --> 00:02:50.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have an impulse to do something,</v>

52
00:02:50.651 --> 00:02:53.860
<v Speaker 1>something captures your interest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something captures your motivation.</v>

53
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.760
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like it's self-generated.</v>

54
00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.520
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

55
00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:59.323
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

56
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.790
<v Speaker 1>that the call to adventure is produced</v>
<v Speaker 1>by something like a transcendent deity</v>

57
00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:05.730
<v Speaker 1>is a really interesting idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

58
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.350
<v Speaker 1>It depends on what you mean by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know you could think about it</v>

59
00:03:08.351 --> 00:03:10.600
<v Speaker 1>as an ancient brain circuit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose.</v>

60
00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:13.210
<v Speaker 1>Although I don't know if that really</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes it things any clearer.</v>

61
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.550
<v Speaker 1>But there is an impulse within people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that pulls them out into the world to go</v>

62
00:03:18.551 --> 00:03:23.140
<v Speaker 1>away from their safe circumstances and</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make their fortunate where there's</v>

63
00:03:23.141 --> 00:03:26.650
<v Speaker 1>famine and tyranny and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and threats to the integrity of the</v>

64
00:03:26.651 --> 00:03:28.420
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are all things that Abraham</v>

65
00:03:28.421 --> 00:03:30.610
<v Speaker 1>immediately encounters when he listens</v>
<v Speaker 1>to God.</v>

66
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.740
<v Speaker 1>And so that seems to be something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's realer than real</v>

67
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.390
<v Speaker 1>because everyone experiences that to</v>
<v Speaker 1>some degree or everyone can relate to</v>

68
00:03:40.391 --> 00:03:41.224
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a deep,</v>

69
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.640
<v Speaker 1>deep theme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

70
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.630
<v Speaker 1>what I'm looking for in the biblical</v>
<v Speaker 1>stories,</v>

71
00:03:46.631 --> 00:03:51.190
<v Speaker 1>in other mythological representations is</v>
<v Speaker 1>these deep universal themes.</v>

72
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.750
<v Speaker 1>Now is that a reconceptualization of</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient philosophy?</v>

73
00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.060
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard to say because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

74
00:03:58.061 --> 00:04:02.470
<v Speaker 1>I derived the idea of the archetype,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in part from reading young and</v>

75
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.990
<v Speaker 1>young of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was influenced because he had a great</v>

76
00:04:04.991 --> 00:04:09.010
<v Speaker 1>classical education by the ancients.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so exactly where these ideas come</v>

77
00:04:09.011 --> 00:04:10.900
<v Speaker 1>from isn't clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

78
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.820
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I guess that's pretty much all I,</v>

79
00:04:15.821 --> 00:04:17.140
<v Speaker 1>all I have to say about that.</v>
