00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.670
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

2
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.150
<v Speaker 1>Abraham sends his eldest servant off to his,</v>

3
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.600
<v Speaker 1>the place that God has granted him to find a wife.</v>

4
00:00:15.601 --> 00:00:18.140
<v Speaker 1>And interestingly it,</v>

5
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.920
<v Speaker 1>the borders of the promised land are quite similar to the current borders of</v>

6
00:00:22.921 --> 00:00:24.930
<v Speaker 1>Israel in these are estimates,</v>

7
00:00:24.931 --> 00:00:25.171
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

8
00:00:25.171 --> 00:00:26.430
<v Speaker 1>Based on on the biblical,</v>

9
00:00:26.431 --> 00:00:28.470
<v Speaker 1>and I didn't mean that's not a fluke obviously,</v>

10
00:00:28.471 --> 00:00:33.471
<v Speaker 1>but it's interesting to see the concordance between these ancient stories and</v>

11
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:35.970
<v Speaker 1>the present day world.</v>

12
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.150
<v Speaker 1>So I thought that was very interesting.</v>

13
00:00:39.151 --> 00:00:41.310
<v Speaker 1>And it shows once again that the past,</v>

14
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.110
<v Speaker 1>you think the past is the past,</v>

15
00:00:43.111 --> 00:00:43.770
<v Speaker 1>but it's not,</v>

16
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:44.380
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

17
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.300
<v Speaker 1>it's still here,</v>

18
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.830
<v Speaker 1>it's embedded in the present.</v>

19
00:00:46.831 --> 00:00:47.340
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

20
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.150
<v Speaker 1>just like the future in somehow in some ways is folded up inside the president</v>

21
00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:52.230
<v Speaker 1>waiting to unfold.</v>

22
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.020
<v Speaker 1>The past is all folded up inside the present too.</v>

23
00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.410
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

24
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.390
<v Speaker 1>the servant goes to,</v>

25
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:03.120
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

26
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.700
<v Speaker 1>the land that he's been charged to go to and,</v>

27
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.511
<v Speaker 1>and he,</v>

28
00:01:06.511 --> 00:01:06.901
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

29
00:01:06.901 --> 00:01:10.440
<v Speaker 1>he's trying to figure out how in the world am I going to find a good wife for</v>

30
00:01:10.441 --> 00:01:10.801
<v Speaker 1>Isaac?</v>

31
00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:11.011
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

32
00:01:11.011 --> 00:01:12.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't know any of these people.</v>

33
00:01:12.121 --> 00:01:16.050
<v Speaker 1>And so he has this little dialogue that's presented in the form of a prayer I</v>

34
00:01:16.051 --> 00:01:16.884
<v Speaker 1>suppose.</v>

35
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.790
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

36
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.170
<v Speaker 1>and he thinks,</v>

37
00:01:19.171 --> 00:01:19.351
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

38
00:01:19.351 --> 00:01:21.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go to the place where you water,</v>

39
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.730
<v Speaker 1>where people get water and water the animals.</v>

40
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.140
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

41
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.820
<v Speaker 1>cause that's a place where everyone gathers.</v>

42
00:01:26.821 --> 00:01:28.660
<v Speaker 1>So that's a good place to find someone.</v>

43
00:01:28.661 --> 00:01:29.130
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

44
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.471
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>

45
00:01:29.471 --> 00:01:33.840
<v Speaker 1>it's not a place of fun and lightness and relaxation and impulsivity.</v>

46
00:01:33.841 --> 00:01:34.690
<v Speaker 1>It's a place of,</v>

47
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.290
<v Speaker 1>of life sustaining work.</v>

48
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.150
<v Speaker 1>And then he thinks something like,</v>

49
00:01:39.151 --> 00:01:44.100
<v Speaker 1>well what would a decent girl do at a watering place?</v>

50
00:01:44.101 --> 00:01:44.881
<v Speaker 1>And he thought,</v>

51
00:01:44.881 --> 00:01:49.881
<v Speaker 1>well maybe she would offer a stranger some water and also offer to water the</v>

52
00:01:52.291 --> 00:01:57.291
<v Speaker 1>camels because that would be brave to approach the stranger and that generous.</v>

53
00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.670
<v Speaker 1>And then indicative of,</v>

54
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.530
<v Speaker 1>of the willingness to make an effort.</v>

55
00:02:01.531 --> 00:02:04.200
<v Speaker 1>And when you know that a camel,</v>

56
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:05.940
<v Speaker 1>I think he took 10 camels.</v>

57
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.800
<v Speaker 1>It was quite a few camels anyways,</v>

58
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:08.723
<v Speaker 1>not just one.</v>

59
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.570
<v Speaker 1>And that a candle can drink 20 gallons of water.</v>

60
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.250
<v Speaker 1>And Rebecca,</v>

61
00:02:14.251 --> 00:02:17.580
<v Speaker 1>who was drawing water from the wet turns out to be Rebecca is drawing water from</v>

62
00:02:17.581 --> 00:02:18.360
<v Speaker 1>the well,</v>

63
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.230
<v Speaker 1>which was hard,</v>

64
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.800
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

65
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.850
<v Speaker 1>Because water's heavy.</v>

66
00:02:20.851 --> 00:02:23.250
<v Speaker 1>And you have to lift it up and it's 10 cows,</v>

67
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.851
<v Speaker 1>camels.</v>

68
00:02:23.851 --> 00:02:25.780
<v Speaker 1>And so that's like 200 gallons of waters.</v>

69
00:02:25.781 --> 00:02:26.280
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

70
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.491
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

71
00:02:26.491 --> 00:02:30.570
<v Speaker 1>she has to put herself out a fair bit in order to make this stranger happy.</v>

72
00:02:30.571 --> 00:02:32.700
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what happens.</v>

73
00:02:32.701 --> 00:02:33.750
<v Speaker 1>And then</v>

74
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.190
<v Speaker 1>serve it has brought along gifts and that sort of thing.</v>

75
00:02:39.191 --> 00:02:40.450
<v Speaker 1>And anyways,</v>

76
00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.980
<v Speaker 1>Tilapia,</v>

77
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:41.940
<v Speaker 1>long story short,</v>

78
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

79
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.840
<v Speaker 1>Rebecca agrees to come back to come back with the servant and Mary Isaac.</v>

80
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.180
<v Speaker 1>And so.</v>
