1
00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.220
<v Speaker 1>One of the really useful things to</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>

2
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.530
<v Speaker 1>and this took me a long time to</v>
<v Speaker 1>formulate properly.</v>

3
00:00:11.531 --> 00:00:13.330
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear the terror management</v>

4
00:00:13.331 --> 00:00:14.350
<v Speaker 1>theorists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

5
00:00:14.351 --> 00:00:18.880
<v Speaker 1>and they have this idea that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're meaning representation.</v>

6
00:00:18.881 --> 00:00:21.970
<v Speaker 1>The story you tell about the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>regulates your,</v>

7
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.250
<v Speaker 1>your death anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

8
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.810
<v Speaker 1>But that's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

9
00:00:25.811 --> 00:00:27.790
<v Speaker 1>it's close to right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a smart idea.</v>

10
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.500
<v Speaker 1>It came from Ernest Becker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

11
00:00:29.501 --> 00:00:31.180
<v Speaker 1>who wrote a book called the denial of</v>
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>

12
00:00:31.181 --> 00:00:33.550
<v Speaker 1>which is actually quite a good book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it's wrong.</v>

13
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes a book can be very useful.</v>

14
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.830
<v Speaker 1>It can be usefully wrong in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Becker's book is usefully wrong</v>

15
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.250
<v Speaker 1>because he thought that it's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>internal representation of your belief</v>

16
00:00:47.321 --> 00:00:52.300
<v Speaker 1>system that regulates your anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that anxiety is fundamentally in the</v>

17
00:00:52.301 --> 00:00:54.760
<v Speaker 1>final analysis anxiety about death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

18
00:00:54.761 --> 00:00:55.870
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

19
00:00:55.871 --> 00:00:56.704
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

20
00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.400
<v Speaker 1>It's a reasonable proposition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't how it works.</v>

21
00:01:00.401 --> 00:01:03.250
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't my beliefs right now that are</v>

22
00:01:03.251 --> 00:01:08.230
<v Speaker 1>regulating my emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the fact that I'm acting out those</v>

23
00:01:08.231 --> 00:01:10.660
<v Speaker 1>beliefs which include implicit</v>
<v Speaker 1>perceptions.</v>

24
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm acting them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so are you.</v>

25
00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.560
<v Speaker 1>And so what you're doing and what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>expect more,</v>

26
00:01:17.561 --> 00:01:20.200
<v Speaker 1>more accurately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing and what I want you to</v>

27
00:01:20.201 --> 00:01:23.080
<v Speaker 1>do and the way I want you to react.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>

28
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.220
<v Speaker 1>that's working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's the match between my belief</v>

29
00:01:27.221 --> 00:01:31.360
<v Speaker 1>system and the way everyone else is</v>
<v Speaker 1>acting that's regulating my emotions.</v>

30
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.830
<v Speaker 1>It's not the belief system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's mediated by the social culture.</v>

31
00:01:35.831 --> 00:01:37.270
<v Speaker 1>And you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you understand this,</v>

32
00:01:37.271 --> 00:01:41.920
<v Speaker 1>then you understand more particularly</v>
<v Speaker 1>why people are willing to fight to the</v>

33
00:01:41.921 --> 00:01:46.180
<v Speaker 1>bitter end to protect their culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a psychological structure that</v>

34
00:01:46.181 --> 00:01:49.540
<v Speaker 1>they're protecting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a psychological structure and a</v>

35
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.240
<v Speaker 1>sociological structures.</v>

36
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.410
<v Speaker 1>Simile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tanium [inaudible].</v>

37
00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.610
<v Speaker 1>So the social contract is you have a set</v>
<v Speaker 1>of expectations and I have a set of</v>

38
00:01:57.611 --> 00:01:59.830
<v Speaker 1>expectations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're actually desires.</v>

39
00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.160
<v Speaker 1>They're not merely expectations because</v>
<v Speaker 1>as living creatures,</v>

40
00:02:03.161 --> 00:02:05.560
<v Speaker 1>we're desirous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't just expect.</v>

41
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.780
<v Speaker 1>And so you desired outcome and I desire</v>
<v Speaker 1>and outcome and we agree to act in</v>

42
00:02:10.781 --> 00:02:13.930
<v Speaker 1>accordance with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the social contract.</v>

43
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.660
<v Speaker 1>And so people don't like to having that</v>
<v Speaker 1>disrupted.</v>

44
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.810
<v Speaker 1>Well it isn't because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologically destabilizes them.</v>

45
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.220
<v Speaker 1>Although it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because it actually destabilizes</v>

46
00:02:24.221 --> 00:02:27.670
<v Speaker 1>the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If all of a sudden we can't occupy the</v>

47
00:02:27.671 --> 00:02:32.671
<v Speaker 1>same specified domain of territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't only that we're thrown into</v>

48
00:02:33.101 --> 00:02:35.650
<v Speaker 1>psychological disarray,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although we will be,</v>

49
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.710
<v Speaker 1>it's that we'll start fighting with each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other like,</v>

50
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.560
<v Speaker 1>and that can kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no joke.</v>

51
00:02:41.561 --> 00:02:44.110
<v Speaker 1>It kills people a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it happens.</v>

52
00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.740
<v Speaker 1>It can happen very easily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are cohesive social group can</v>

53
00:02:47.741 --> 00:02:51.460
<v Speaker 1>fragment along some fracture line of</v>
<v Speaker 1>identity let's say.</v>

54
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.010
<v Speaker 1>And all hell breaks loose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

55
00:02:54.011 --> 00:02:58.210
<v Speaker 1>that's what happened with the Tutsis and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hutu and in uh,</v>

56
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

57
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.760
<v Speaker 1>and those things can get out of control</v>
<v Speaker 1>just so fast.</v>

58
00:03:03.761 --> 00:03:05.380
<v Speaker 1>It's just unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

59
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.010
<v Speaker 1>and that wasn't death anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was death.</v>

60
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.260
<v Speaker 1>That's a whole different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the other thing,</v>

61
00:03:11.261 --> 00:03:13.900
<v Speaker 1>the terror management people don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly get,</v>

62
00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:16.330
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't just that your culture and your</v>

63
00:03:16.331 --> 00:03:20.410
<v Speaker 1>cultural beliefs protect you from</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety and say anxiety about death.</v>

64
00:03:20.411 --> 00:03:25.210
<v Speaker 1>Even it's that they actually protect you</v>
<v Speaker 1>from death as well as protecting you</v>

65
00:03:25.211 --> 00:03:26.170
<v Speaker 1>from death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anxiety.</v>

66
00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:27.004
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

67
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.180
<v Speaker 1>it's warm in here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's cold outside.</v>

68
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.310
<v Speaker 1>The fact that the culture is intact</v>
<v Speaker 1>means that you're not outside freezing.</v>

69
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.810
<v Speaker 1>That's a hell of a lot more fundamental</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense than mere anxiety.</v>

70
00:03:40.811 --> 00:03:44.260
<v Speaker 1>Although I'm not trying to underplay the</v>
<v Speaker 1>role of anxiety.</v>

71
00:03:44.261 --> 00:03:47.140
<v Speaker 1>That's a major issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's something that's a lot more</v>

72
00:03:47.141 --> 00:03:49.780
<v Speaker 1>fundamental at stake than mere</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology.</v>

73
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.110
<v Speaker 1>So it's the match between your map of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and other people's actions</v>

74
00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:58.130
<v Speaker 1>that regulates your emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

75
00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.600
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it regulates it completely because you</v>

76
00:04:01.601 --> 00:04:02.140
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

77
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.740
<v Speaker 1>if someone in here started acting</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously deranged,</v>

78
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.240
<v Speaker 1>like brandish to pistol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say all of a sudden you would not</v>

79
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.170
<v Speaker 1>be in the same place at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a bit.</v>

80
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.210
<v Speaker 1>And so what would happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

81
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.670
<v Speaker 1>chaos would happen and chaos isn't just</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you would get anxious.</v>

82
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.450
<v Speaker 1>That's not a good enough explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would happen is more complex than</v>

83
00:04:25.451 --> 00:04:25.881
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

84
00:04:25.881 --> 00:04:28.960
<v Speaker 1>what happens in some senses that your</v>
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>

85
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.480
<v Speaker 1>and it does this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does this,</v>

86
00:04:31.481 --> 00:04:34.900
<v Speaker 1>what would happen is that you would</v>
<v Speaker 1>react the same way that Iraq reacts to a</v>

87
00:04:34.901 --> 00:04:37.030
<v Speaker 1>cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly that.</v>

88
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.390
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would respond as if a terrible</v>

89
00:04:40.391 --> 00:04:44.500
<v Speaker 1>Predator had emerged in your midst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what is that reaction?</v>

90
00:04:44.501 --> 00:04:47.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just anxiety because when you</v>

91
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.890
<v Speaker 1>encounter a Predator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety isn't the only thing that's</v>

92
00:04:50.891 --> 00:04:52.660
<v Speaker 1>useful that just makes you freeze.</v>

93
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like that could be the worst thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do.</v>

94
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.230
<v Speaker 1>You freeze and well you're a pretty easy</v>
<v Speaker 1>target so you have to be prepared for a</v>

95
00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:01.750
<v Speaker 1>lot broader range of responses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mirror,</v>

96
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.690
<v Speaker 1>mirror,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mirror,</v>

97
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.980
<v Speaker 1>Petrofac location,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how bout a little aggression that</v>

98
00:05:08.981 --> 00:05:10.540
<v Speaker 1>might be helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know.</v>

99
00:05:10.541 --> 00:05:12.580
<v Speaker 1>It also might get you killed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

100
00:05:12.581 --> 00:05:15.460
<v Speaker 1>maybe you can take the guy down and</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's a good idea,</v>

101
00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:16.743
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

102
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.590
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you have to run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's deceive inhibited as well.</v>

103
00:05:20.591 --> 00:05:23.920
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you have to think really</v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly and reflexively.</v>

104
00:05:23.921 --> 00:05:27.070
<v Speaker 1>So that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's activated disinhibited I would</v>

105
00:05:27.071 --> 00:05:29.830
<v Speaker 1>say as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like your whole being is thrown</v>

106
00:05:29.831 --> 00:05:34.780
<v Speaker 1>into intense concentration on the moment</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're burning up physiological</v>

107
00:05:34.781 --> 00:05:37.480
<v Speaker 1>resources like mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what will happen after something</v>

108
00:05:37.481 --> 00:05:41.560
<v Speaker 1>like that if you don't develop outright</v>
<v Speaker 1>posttraumatic stress disorder,</v>

109
00:05:41.561 --> 00:05:45.790
<v Speaker 1>which some of you would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you assuming that the situation</v>

110
00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:49.330
<v Speaker 1>was brought under control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd walk out of here shaking with your</v>

111
00:05:49.331 --> 00:05:51.910
<v Speaker 1>heart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rate it like one 70 and it would take</v>

112
00:05:51.911 --> 00:05:54.430
<v Speaker 1>you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while it might take you the rest of your</v>

113
00:05:54.431 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 1>life and maybe you would never recover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could bloody well be sure that</v>

114
00:05:58.071 --> 00:06:00.170
<v Speaker 1>it would take you the rest of the day.</v>

115
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.850
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's no joke when someone steps</v>

116
00:06:04.851 --> 00:06:08.120
<v Speaker 1>steps outside the confines of the social</v>
<v Speaker 1>contract,</v>

117
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:09.470
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's kind of,</v>

118
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.300
<v Speaker 1>there's a philosopher named Hobbs who I</v>
<v Speaker 1>suppose in some sense was a centrally</v>

119
00:06:14.301 --> 00:06:16.790
<v Speaker 1>conservative philosopher as opposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russo,</v>

120
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.330
<v Speaker 1>who's kind of his exact opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rousseau believed that people were</v>

121
00:06:20.331 --> 00:06:25.160
<v Speaker 1>basically good in their natural state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he believed nature was basically good</v>

122
00:06:25.161 --> 00:06:27.890
<v Speaker 1>and he believed that culture was what</v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupted people.</v>

123
00:06:27.891 --> 00:06:28.724
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

124
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:30.440
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

125
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.750
<v Speaker 1>Hobbs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thomas Hobbes believed exactly the</v>

126
00:06:32.751 --> 00:06:35.480
<v Speaker 1>opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He believed that in the state of nature,</v>

127
00:06:35.481 --> 00:06:39.380
<v Speaker 1>let's say every person was at every</v>
<v Speaker 1>other person's throat,</v>

128
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:44.710
<v Speaker 1>and the only thing that prevented</v>
<v Speaker 1>continual chaos was the imposition of a,</v>

129
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.940
<v Speaker 1>of a collective agreement that would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>the social contract that essentially</v>

130
00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:54.200
<v Speaker 1>governed how people would interact and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would keep that underlying chaos at</v>

131
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:55.970
<v Speaker 1>at bay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

132
00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:00.650
<v Speaker 1>my contention is is that Hobbes was</v>
<v Speaker 1>correct and Russolo was correct.</v>

133
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.940
<v Speaker 1>And I think that if you add Russo and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hobbes together,</v>

134
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:07.640
<v Speaker 1>you get a total picture of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really,</v>

135
00:07:07.641 --> 00:07:10.820
<v Speaker 1>I think the picture of the world that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to relate to you.</v>

136
00:07:10.821 --> 00:07:12.500
<v Speaker 1>It's both at once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

137
00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:17.740
<v Speaker 1>well you can't just attribute human</v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolence and unpredictability to</v>

138
00:07:19.581 --> 00:07:21.120
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's does.</v>

139
00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:23.690
<v Speaker 1>It's a nonstarter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like people build society.</v>

140
00:07:23.691 --> 00:07:25.670
<v Speaker 1>So all you're doing is pushing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem back.</v>

141
00:07:25.671 --> 00:07:28.760
<v Speaker 1>It's like where did it come from while</v>
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>

142
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:32.540
<v Speaker 1>this society before?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then the one before that,</v>

143
00:07:32.541 --> 00:07:34.880
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you got to tangle up the individual</v>

144
00:07:34.881 --> 00:07:37.640
<v Speaker 1>in there at some point because people</v>
<v Speaker 1>created society.</v>

145
00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:43.180
<v Speaker 1>And so you can't just blame human</v>
<v Speaker 1>irrationality and malevolence on</v>

146
00:07:43.221 --> 00:07:45.480
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well and also it's,</v>

147
00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:50.150
<v Speaker 1>it's ungrateful for God's sake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like society obviously also makes</v>

148
00:07:50.151 --> 00:07:52.310
<v Speaker 1>you peaceful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of the reason you're peaceful right</v>

149
00:07:52.311 --> 00:07:54.470
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of you is because while you're not</v>

150
00:07:54.471 --> 00:07:57.200
<v Speaker 1>that hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're certainly not starving to death.</v>

151
00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.990
<v Speaker 1>You would be a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very different person if you were</v>

152
00:07:59.991 --> 00:08:01.730
<v Speaker 1>starving right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

153
00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:05.690
<v Speaker 1>or if you were enraged or if you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>panicking or if you were terrified</v>

154
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:09.140
<v Speaker 1>because your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your future was radically uncertain.</v>

155
00:08:09.141 --> 00:08:11.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just not any of those people</v>

156
00:08:11.811 --> 00:08:13.070
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe,</v>

157
00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:16.850
<v Speaker 1>satiated and I mean that technically</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're satisfied.</v>

158
00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:20.540
<v Speaker 1>None of your biological systems except</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps curiosity,</v>

159
00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:25.310
<v Speaker 1>which is a rather pleasant emotion are</v>
<v Speaker 1>activated in the least.</v>

160
00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.740
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of that you all think,</v>

161
00:08:27.741 --> 00:08:29.240
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in control of yourself.</v>

162
00:08:29.241 --> 00:08:32.360
<v Speaker 1>But don't be thinking that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just not right.</v>

163
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at how the brain is</v>

164
00:08:34.371 --> 00:08:35.690
<v Speaker 1>structured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

165
00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.390
<v Speaker 1>the Hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a really important part of the</v>

166
00:08:38.391 --> 00:08:39.620
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It basically,</v>

167
00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:44.980
<v Speaker 1>it basically establishes the framework</v>
<v Speaker 1>of reference and the actions,</v>

168
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:49.370
<v Speaker 1>the framework of reference within which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the actions you take in order to</v>

169
00:08:49.371 --> 00:08:51.410
<v Speaker 1>fulfill basic biological needs.</v>

170
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:54.920
<v Speaker 1>So the hypothalamus makes you thirsty</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the hypothalamus makes you hungry</v>

171
00:08:54.921 --> 00:08:58.580
<v Speaker 1>and it makes you sexually aroused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it puts you into a state of defensive</v>

172
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:00.090
<v Speaker 1>aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>

173
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:04.110
<v Speaker 1>it actually also makes you explore and</v>
<v Speaker 1>be curious.</v>

174
00:09:04.111 --> 00:09:07.050
<v Speaker 1>All of that's hypothalamic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an amazing structure.</v>

175
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:10.110
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's really small and it's right at</v>

176
00:09:10.111 --> 00:09:12.060
<v Speaker 1>the base of the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

177
00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:15.870
<v Speaker 1>and you could imagine it as something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has tremendously powerful</v>

178
00:09:15.871 --> 00:09:19.560
<v Speaker 1>projections upward throughout the rest</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the brain into the emotional systems</v>

179
00:09:19.561 --> 00:09:24.270
<v Speaker 1>in the cortical systems and all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like tree trunk size connections,</v>

180
00:09:24.271 --> 00:09:25.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphorically speaking.</v>

181
00:09:25.951 --> 00:09:30.420
<v Speaker 1>And then the cortex has these little</v>
<v Speaker 1>light vine like tendrils going down to</v>

182
00:09:30.421 --> 00:09:32.280
<v Speaker 1>regulate the hypothalamus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

183
00:09:32.281 --> 00:09:34.320
<v Speaker 1>and if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when push comes to shove,</v>

184
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.600
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Hypothalamus,</v>

185
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:39.000
<v Speaker 1>that thing wins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

186
00:09:39.001 --> 00:09:41.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get people now and then who have a</v>

187
00:09:41.341 --> 00:09:45.060
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamic dysfunction and one of them</v>
<v Speaker 1>produces a condition called,</v>

188
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.210
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not dips Romania.</v>

189
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.120
<v Speaker 1>Although it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like that doesn't matter.</v>

190
00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:55.890
<v Speaker 1>It produces the uncontrollable thirst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what will happen is that people</v>

191
00:09:55.891 --> 00:10:00.030
<v Speaker 1>who have this hypothalamic problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll drown themselves by drinking</v>

192
00:10:00.031 --> 00:10:01.950
<v Speaker 1>water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you can do by the way.</v>

193
00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:05.550
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so they just cannot get enough water</v>

194
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.520
<v Speaker 1>and there's no stopping them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

195
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:10.920
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no more than there would be stopping you</v>

196
00:10:10.921 --> 00:10:13.080
<v Speaker 1>if you were suffering from raging</v>
<v Speaker 1>thirst.</v>

197
00:10:13.081 --> 00:10:15.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a happy day when the hypothalamus</v>

198
00:10:15.691 --> 00:10:18.120
<v Speaker 1>is not telling you what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

199
00:10:18.121 --> 00:10:21.930
<v Speaker 1>you live in such a civilized state that</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the time,</v>

200
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:27.450
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're tranquil and satisfied and more</v>

201
00:10:27.451 --> 00:10:30.630
<v Speaker 1>or less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can imagine yourself as a peaceful,</v>

202
00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>productive well meaning</v>

203
00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.460
<v Speaker 1>entity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But don't be thinking that that's what</v>

204
00:10:38.461 --> 00:10:40.350
<v Speaker 1>you'd be if you were put in the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>

205
00:10:40.351 --> 00:10:42.330
<v Speaker 1>because that's just not right at all.</v>
