1
00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.690
<v Speaker 1>Is this pace from search for the holy</v>
<v Speaker 1>grail.</v>

2
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.600
<v Speaker 1>The Holy Grail is a myth that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>constructed in Glenndon and the math</v>

3
00:00:13.601 --> 00:00:15.790
<v Speaker 1>goes something like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a cop,</v>

4
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.910
<v Speaker 1>the grail used to hold Christ's blood</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that cop has a redemptive</v>

5
00:00:21.761 --> 00:00:26.230
<v Speaker 1>significance and it's been lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the night's King Arthur's night to</v>

6
00:00:26.231 --> 00:00:28.480
<v Speaker 1>go off to look for the holy grail or</v>
<v Speaker 1>after this cup.</v>

7
00:00:28.481 --> 00:00:30.070
<v Speaker 1>So it's a redemption story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

8
00:00:30.071 --> 00:00:35.071
<v Speaker 1>It means the world's damned unredeemed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some object that can serve as as</v>

9
00:00:37.211 --> 00:00:40.060
<v Speaker 1>the source of redemption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the source of nourishment,</v>

10
00:00:40.061 --> 00:00:42.100
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it from a symbolic</v>

11
00:00:42.101 --> 00:00:44.620
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's worthwhile to go on a quest of</v>

12
00:00:44.621 --> 00:00:47.740
<v Speaker 1>that sword.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the King Arthur's story is set up in</v>

13
00:00:47.741 --> 00:00:49.780
<v Speaker 1>an interesting way because there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>King Arthur,</v>

14
00:00:49.781 --> 00:00:53.050
<v Speaker 1>but he has all these nights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these nobles and they all sit at a round</v>

15
00:00:53.051 --> 00:00:55.990
<v Speaker 1>table and they're at a round table</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're equals.</v>

16
00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.110
<v Speaker 1>So although it's a hierarchical story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a motif in it that transcends</v>

17
00:01:01.331 --> 00:01:02.200
<v Speaker 1>the hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>

18
00:01:02.201 --> 00:01:04.450
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

19
00:01:04.451 --> 00:01:07.960
<v Speaker 1>under normal circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's in arranged in a hierarchy,</v>

20
00:01:07.961 --> 00:01:10.750
<v Speaker 1>but when you're out to seek whatever you</v>
<v Speaker 1>need,</v>

21
00:01:10.751 --> 00:01:12.760
<v Speaker 1>then everyone's an equal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so fine.</v>

22
00:01:12.761 --> 00:01:15.790
<v Speaker 1>So they sit at the round table and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go off to search for the holy</v>

23
00:01:15.791 --> 00:01:18.250
<v Speaker 1>grail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the story opens with a very</v>

24
00:01:18.251 --> 00:01:20.950
<v Speaker 1>interesting Motif,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the nights look at the forest</v>

25
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.900
<v Speaker 1>and then they try to find the part that</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks the darkest to them and then they</v>

26
00:01:25.901 --> 00:01:28.450
<v Speaker 1>go that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the marker for their mission,</v>

27
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.380
<v Speaker 1>right to go to the darkest place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course each night goes off in a</v>

28
00:01:32.381 --> 00:01:36.160
<v Speaker 1>different direction because the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks slightly different to each night.</v>

29
00:01:36.161 --> 00:01:40.570
<v Speaker 1>So objectively speaking they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a different place,</v>

30
00:01:40.571 --> 00:01:43.330
<v Speaker 1>but psychologically speaking they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to the same place.</v>

31
00:01:43.331 --> 00:01:47.230
<v Speaker 1>Right in that place I suppose is being</v>
<v Speaker 1>represented in mythology and literature</v>

32
00:01:47.231 --> 00:01:50.620
<v Speaker 1>is the heart of darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're ever curious about why</v>

33
00:01:50.621 --> 00:01:54.790
<v Speaker 1>people aren't enlightened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since it seems to be a possibility,</v>

34
00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.380
<v Speaker 1>you can always think about the story of</v>
<v Speaker 1>King Arthur and the knights of the holy</v>

35
00:01:59.381 --> 00:02:01.660
<v Speaker 1>grail and think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well do you really want to enter the</v>

36
00:02:01.661 --> 00:02:04.150
<v Speaker 1>forest at the darkest place?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what that is.</v>

37
00:02:04.151 --> 00:02:05.500
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

38
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.580
<v Speaker 1>because the darkest place means</v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely that place you least want to</v>

39
00:02:09.581 --> 00:02:11.380
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the same for everyone.</v>

40
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.920
<v Speaker 1>So then I have this little nephew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although he's almost 15 now,</v>

41
00:02:19.921 --> 00:02:21.960
<v Speaker 1>he had this dream when he was four years</v>
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>

42
00:02:21.961 --> 00:02:26.961
<v Speaker 1>And the background to the dream is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was waking up in the middle of the</v>

43
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.210
<v Speaker 1>night for months screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had night terrors and this went on</v>

44
00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:35.160
<v Speaker 1>for like six months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what was happening in his life was</v>

45
00:02:35.161 --> 00:02:37.500
<v Speaker 1>two fold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was some instability in his family</v>

46
00:02:37.501 --> 00:02:39.930
<v Speaker 1>because his parents got divorced about a</v>
<v Speaker 1>year after that.</v>

47
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.890
<v Speaker 1>And also he was at the transition point</v>
<v Speaker 1>from staying at home to going to</v>

48
00:02:43.891 --> 00:02:45.130
<v Speaker 1>kindergarten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

49
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.360
<v Speaker 1>not only was he making the big move out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there into the terrible world,</v>

50
00:02:48.361 --> 00:02:53.361
<v Speaker 1>but the stable point from which he might</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to have moved was shaky.</v>

51
00:02:53.431 --> 00:02:55.500
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't having that great a time.</v>

52
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.320
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's screaming away at night and this is</v>

53
00:02:59.321 --> 00:03:00.370
<v Speaker 1>pretty unsettling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

54
00:03:00.371 --> 00:03:01.750
<v Speaker 1>Cause night terrors are no joke.</v>

55
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.600
<v Speaker 1>And so he's upset about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His mom's upset about it and so I'm</v>

56
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:06.310
<v Speaker 1>watching him and he's running around the</v>
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

57
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:08.320
<v Speaker 1>He's only about this high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very verbal kid.</v>

58
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.520
<v Speaker 1>And he's got this night hat on in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>sword and the shield and he's running</v>

59
00:03:12.521 --> 00:03:16.240
<v Speaker 1>around the house being a night and at</v>
<v Speaker 1>night he takes his night hack and his</v>

60
00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:18.060
<v Speaker 1>shield and his sword Tibet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank,</v>

61
00:03:18.061 --> 00:03:21.160
<v Speaker 1>oh that's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can see how that makes sense,</v>

62
00:03:21.161 --> 00:03:23.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can see how it's an inactive</v>

63
00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:28.381
<v Speaker 1>reality cause children enact or act out</v>
<v Speaker 1>their reality before they can explicitly</v>

64
00:03:28.571 --> 00:03:33.571
<v Speaker 1>understand it just like we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm staying there.</v>

65
00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.670
<v Speaker 1>One night he wakes up and he has it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

66
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.410
<v Speaker 1>one of these fits and then the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>morning it comes to breakfast.</v>

67
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.520
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

68
00:03:39.521 --> 00:03:41.410
<v Speaker 1>did you have any dreams last night?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

69
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:42.910
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a dream.</v>

70
00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.860
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well tell us the dream.</v>

71
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.470
<v Speaker 1>And there's six adults sitting around</v>
<v Speaker 1>the table.</v>

72
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.240
<v Speaker 1>And then he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

73
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.600
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was out in this field and I was</v>

74
00:03:52.601 --> 00:03:56.620
<v Speaker 1>surrounded by beat dwarves and they came</v>
<v Speaker 1>up to my knees.</v>

75
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.690
<v Speaker 1>And so these doors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had no arms,</v>

76
00:03:58.691 --> 00:04:02.620
<v Speaker 1>they just had shoulders and powerful</v>
<v Speaker 1>legs and they're all covered with hair.</v>

77
00:04:02.621 --> 00:04:05.080
<v Speaker 1>And they had a cross shaved on the top</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their head and they were all covered</v>

78
00:04:05.081 --> 00:04:07.750
<v Speaker 1>with grease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everywhere I went these doors would</v>

79
00:04:07.751 --> 00:04:11.400
<v Speaker 1>jump up with their beaks and bite me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're looking at,</v>

80
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that accounts for the night terrors,</v>

81
00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:16.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then he says,</v>

82
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.550
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's more to it too.</v>

83
00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.010
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you looked in the background behind</v>

84
00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:23.890
<v Speaker 1>all the doors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a dragon way in the background</v>

85
00:04:23.891 --> 00:04:27.640
<v Speaker 1>and it was puffing out fire and smoke</v>
<v Speaker 1>and every time it puffed out fire and</v>

86
00:04:27.641 --> 00:04:31.180
<v Speaker 1>smoke a whole bunch more of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>dwarves would get made.</v>

87
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.820
<v Speaker 1>And you think that's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a hydra story,</v>

88
00:04:33.821 --> 00:04:35.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember the story of the Hydra,</v>

89
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.930
<v Speaker 1>you cut off one head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two more grows.</v>

90
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.000
<v Speaker 1>It's one of Hercules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

91
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.000
<v Speaker 1>trials.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's an observation about the</v>

92
00:04:43.001 --> 00:04:45.280
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is you solve one problem and like</v>

93
00:04:45.281 --> 00:04:47.500
<v Speaker 1>two more problems pop up and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>solve those.</v>

94
00:04:47.501 --> 00:04:48.670
<v Speaker 1>And anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

95
00:04:48.671 --> 00:04:50.440
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I've got this dragon back there.</v>

96
00:04:50.441 --> 00:04:52.180
<v Speaker 1>And so this is his problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

97
00:04:52.181 --> 00:04:55.000
<v Speaker 1>He's being eaten by beat dwarves and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not good.</v>

98
00:04:55.001 --> 00:04:58.510
<v Speaker 1>And there's not much sense fighting them</v>
<v Speaker 1>off because there's just more of a made</v>

99
00:04:58.511 --> 00:05:01.120
<v Speaker 1>every time this thing lurking in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>background breeds.</v>

100
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.610
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what could you do about that?</v>

101
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.750
<v Speaker 1>It's like his brain was working all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these ideas around and he'd heard lots</v>

102
00:05:07.751 --> 00:05:11.500
<v Speaker 1>of Disney stories and had lots of books</v>
<v Speaker 1>read to them and had abstracted out a</v>

103
00:05:11.501 --> 00:05:14.230
<v Speaker 1>lot of information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he hadn't quite got it right.</v>

104
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.760
<v Speaker 1>And it was all seeding around in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

105
00:05:15.761 --> 00:05:17.860
<v Speaker 1>And I just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what could you do?</v>

106
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.360
<v Speaker 1>Tap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he went,</v>

107
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.500
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what I could do.</v>

108
00:05:20.501 --> 00:05:23.380
<v Speaker 1>I could take my sword and I'd get my</v>
<v Speaker 1>dad,</v>

109
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.170
<v Speaker 1>which is a good notion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

110
00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.670
<v Speaker 1>Cause he's small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I jump up on the dragon and I'd</v>

111
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.940
<v Speaker 1>pop out both of its eyes with the sword</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it couldn't see me.</v>

112
00:05:30.941 --> 00:05:35.840
<v Speaker 1>And then I'd go down its throat to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>box where the fire came out and then I</v>

113
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.440
<v Speaker 1>carve a piece out of the box and I'd use</v>
<v Speaker 1>that as a shield.</v>

114
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.450
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>

115
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.330
<v Speaker 1>you really got the story and the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like this,</v>

116
00:05:43.331 --> 00:05:46.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're being plagued by midget dwarfs</v>

117
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.200
<v Speaker 1>and you wipe them out and they keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiplying while you're obviously</v>

118
00:05:50.201 --> 00:05:51.580
<v Speaker 1>aiming at the wrong target,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

119
00:05:51.581 --> 00:05:53.230
<v Speaker 1>You should be going to their source.</v>

120
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.350
<v Speaker 1>So he went after the dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not only after the dragon,</v>

121
00:05:56.351 --> 00:05:58.250
<v Speaker 1>he went right down the throat of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dragon,</v>

122
00:05:58.251 --> 00:05:59.180
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

123
00:05:59.181 --> 00:06:01.910
<v Speaker 1>a fairly brave thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then right to the place where the</v>

124
00:06:01.911 --> 00:06:04.400
<v Speaker 1>fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the transforming element was being</v>

125
00:06:04.401 --> 00:06:07.490
<v Speaker 1>produced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he took a piece of the device that</v>

126
00:06:07.491 --> 00:06:10.520
<v Speaker 1>made the transforming element and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>used it as a shield.</v>

127
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.890
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's really cool.</v>

128
00:06:12.891 --> 00:06:14.540
<v Speaker 1>And the story is better than that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

129
00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:16.970
<v Speaker 1>And it's true even so it's not one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those fake,</v>

130
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.450
<v Speaker 1>he was dreaming and then woke up sorta</v>
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>

131
00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.890
<v Speaker 1>This actually happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't have any more nightmares.</v>

132
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.800
<v Speaker 1>So when I checked with his mother</v>
<v Speaker 1>repeatedly after that,</v>

133
00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:25.521
<v Speaker 1>because I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

134
00:06:25.521 --> 00:06:26.870
<v Speaker 1>this is too good to be true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

135
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.970
<v Speaker 1>It's got this terrible night terror</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

136
00:06:28.971 --> 00:06:32.060
<v Speaker 1>He does one little mythological dream</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and bang,</v>

137
00:06:32.061 --> 00:06:33.380
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's better.</v>

138
00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.750
<v Speaker 1>But that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't have any more nightmares after</v>

139
00:06:35.751 --> 00:06:37.570
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's because he don't</v>

140
00:06:37.571 --> 00:06:40.790
<v Speaker 1>almost already got it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's running around like a night.</v>

141
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:46.270
<v Speaker 1>He knew almost just had to be made a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little more explicit and not even not</v>

142
00:06:46.431 --> 00:06:48.690
<v Speaker 1>explicit cause it was still a story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

143
00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.820
<v Speaker 1>he didn't know you should go to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>source of your anxieties,</v>

144
00:06:52.821 --> 00:06:54.860
<v Speaker 1>right to the thing that plagues you the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most.</v>

145
00:06:54.861 --> 00:06:58.700
<v Speaker 1>And you should explore that in detail</v>
<v Speaker 1>until you find the information that it</v>

146
00:06:58.701 --> 00:07:00.410
<v Speaker 1>contains that will protect you against</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

147
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:03.920
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he can tell the story and he could</v>

148
00:07:03.921 --> 00:07:06.200
<v Speaker 1>act it out and that looked like it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>good enough.</v>

149
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.760
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he basically,</v>

150
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he managed this,</v>

151
00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.730
<v Speaker 1>essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he fought the dragon of chaos and pop</v>

152
00:07:16.731 --> 00:07:21.560
<v Speaker 1>back up as what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as he who can obtain victory over the</v>

153
00:07:21.561 --> 00:07:24.500
<v Speaker 1>dragon of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a pretty good story because</v>

154
00:07:24.501 --> 00:07:25.610
<v Speaker 1>it says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

155
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:31.430
<v Speaker 1>if your frame of reference gets blown</v>
<v Speaker 1>away by something you don't understand</v>

156
00:07:31.431 --> 00:07:35.570
<v Speaker 1>some new challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you face the challenge at least</v>

157
00:07:35.571 --> 00:07:38.990
<v Speaker 1>courageously and humility and humbly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means you know you're not gonna</v>

158
00:07:38.991 --> 00:07:40.850
<v Speaker 1>run away on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you still have something to learn,</v>

159
00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:44.600
<v Speaker 1>then you can extract something out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the battle that will enable you to</v>

160
00:07:44.601 --> 00:07:45.260
<v Speaker 1>withstand.</v>
