00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.580
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that happens to Joseph is that,</v>

2
00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:08.981
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3
00:00:08.981 --> 00:00:13.500
<v Speaker 1>a lot of bad things happened to them because he's the favorite of his father.</v>

4
00:00:13.501 --> 00:00:14.520
<v Speaker 1>His brothers hate him.</v>

5
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.430
<v Speaker 1>And so the first they're going to throw him in a pit.</v>

6
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:18.960
<v Speaker 1>I think they do throw him in a pit.</v>

7
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.090
<v Speaker 1>Then they sell them to be a slave.</v>

8
00:00:21.091 --> 00:00:23.520
<v Speaker 1>Then he ends up in what we go through the story.</v>

9
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.050
<v Speaker 1>He ends up some places where you probably wouldn't want to go prison being one</v>

10
00:00:28.051 --> 00:00:28.884
<v Speaker 1>of them,</v>

11
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.143
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

12
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.900
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter because even when they put him in prison,</v>

13
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.910
<v Speaker 1>he's actually not in prison.</v>

14
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.120
<v Speaker 1>He just figures out how to make the prison work way better.</v>

15
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.190
<v Speaker 1>And then he's in control of the prison.</v>

16
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.780
<v Speaker 1>And it's really,</v>

17
00:00:42.781 --> 00:00:43.620
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting,</v>

18
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.420
<v Speaker 1>I had this friend,</v>

19
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

20
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.360
<v Speaker 1>and he was very smart,</v>

21
00:00:48.361 --> 00:00:49.320
<v Speaker 1>but very cynical,</v>

22
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.620
<v Speaker 1>and he wasn't employed very well and he got a little older than he should have</v>

23
00:00:54.871 --> 00:00:58.590
<v Speaker 1>given his level of intelligence and employability.</v>

24
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.590
<v Speaker 1>And so he had to take jobs that weren't very intellectually challenging.</v>

25
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.371
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

26
00:01:02.371 --> 00:01:06.300
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things I tried to convince him of was that even if he worked,</v>

27
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.650
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to work behind the parts department in an automotive store cause he</v>

28
00:01:10.651 --> 00:01:12.600
<v Speaker 1>liked cars but it was beneath him.</v>

29
00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:13.434
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

30
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.273
<v Speaker 1>cause it was sort of a,</v>

31
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.260
<v Speaker 1>as far as he was concerned,</v>

32
00:01:16.261 --> 00:01:17.094
<v Speaker 1>it was a,</v>

33
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.560
<v Speaker 1>he was too smart for a job like that,</v>

34
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.360
<v Speaker 1>which actually turned out not to be true.</v>

35
00:01:21.361 --> 00:01:23.880
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't smart enough for a job like that or he wasn't wise enough.</v>

36
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.541
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

37
00:01:24.541 --> 00:01:24.750
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

38
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.590
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I tried to tell them was that you're looking at the situation</v>

39
00:01:28.591 --> 00:01:32.820
<v Speaker 1>wrong because even in a simple job so called simple job,</v>

40
00:01:32.821 --> 00:01:34.950
<v Speaker 1>like let's say dishwashing in a restaurant,</v>

41
00:01:34.951 --> 00:01:36.030
<v Speaker 1>which I did an awful lot of,</v>

42
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.290
<v Speaker 1>it's not that simple.</v>

43
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.990
<v Speaker 1>You're dealing with a lot of other people,</v>

44
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.670
<v Speaker 1>very fast staff changeover,</v>

45
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:42.630
<v Speaker 1>you're feeding people,</v>

46
00:01:42.631 --> 00:01:44.790
<v Speaker 1>you're helping them have a celebration,</v>

47
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.940
<v Speaker 1>you're helping them take a break.</v>

48
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.310
<v Speaker 1>Like you can do it really well and then the kitchen can operate properly and</v>

49
00:01:52.311 --> 00:01:54.020
<v Speaker 1>then people can come out to the restaurant.</v>

50
00:01:54.021 --> 00:01:55.360
<v Speaker 1>It's not a bloody catastrophe.</v>

51
00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:56.990
<v Speaker 1>Like you're,</v>

52
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.570
<v Speaker 1>even when you're doing something that's a menial job,</v>

53
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:00.381
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

54
00:02:00.381 --> 00:02:01.250
<v Speaker 1>like dishwashing,</v>

55
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.320
<v Speaker 1>there are ways of doing it really badly,</v>

56
00:02:03.321 --> 00:02:06.830
<v Speaker 1>resentfully and horribly and doing it really well.</v>

57
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.360
<v Speaker 1>And as soon as you do it really well,</v>

58
00:02:08.361 --> 00:02:09.740
<v Speaker 1>it's not a menial job anymore.</v>

59
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.900
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

60
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.140
<v Speaker 1>it immediately transformed.</v>

61
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.411
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

62
00:02:12.411 --> 00:02:12.651
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

63
00:02:12.651 --> 00:02:16.920
<v Speaker 1>you can be around people who won't let that happen and you should go get another</v>

64
00:02:16.921 --> 00:02:18.000
<v Speaker 1>job if that's the case.</v>

65
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.650
<v Speaker 1>But if you do it properly,</v>

66
00:02:19.651 --> 00:02:21.270
<v Speaker 1>then it's not meaningful at all.</v>

67
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.240
<v Speaker 1>And that's also a good way out of resentment.</v>

68
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.691
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>

69
00:02:26.691 --> 00:02:26.841
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

70
00:02:26.841 --> 00:02:27.591
<v Speaker 1>I've just got this,</v>

71
00:02:27.591 --> 00:02:27.831
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

72
00:02:27.831 --> 00:02:28.581
<v Speaker 1>two bit job.</v>

73
00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:28.851
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

74
00:02:28.851 --> 00:02:29.031
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

75
00:02:29.031 --> 00:02:31.670
<v Speaker 1>what if he did it as well as you possibly could?</v>

76
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.120
<v Speaker 1>You know what would happen?</v>

77
00:02:33.121 --> 00:02:33.301
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

78
00:02:33.301 --> 00:02:35.580
<v Speaker 1>the first thing that would happen is you'd get a lot smarter,</v>

79
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:36.571
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

80
00:02:36.571 --> 00:02:39.210
<v Speaker 1>And that that's hardly a negative thing.</v>
