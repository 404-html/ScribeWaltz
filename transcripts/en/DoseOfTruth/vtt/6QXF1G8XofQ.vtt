1
00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.670
<v Speaker 1>Dr peterson was the party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you both for being here today.</v>

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.240
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when political scientists have studied</v>

3
00:00:07.241 --> 00:00:08.710
<v Speaker 1>is to solitary and regimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

4
00:00:08.711 --> 00:00:10.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to move this a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just feel weird.</v>

5
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.040
<v Speaker 1>Totalitarian regimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've studied.</v>

6
00:00:12.041 --> 00:00:15.700
<v Speaker 1>I tried to look at the Iranian</v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution and the Islamic Republic of</v>

7
00:00:15.701 --> 00:00:20.280
<v Speaker 1>Iran and I've argued how the Shia Islam</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is teached in the Islamic republic</v>

8
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.610
<v Speaker 1>is very close to a totalitarian regime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now I live in a country where my</v>

9
00:00:24.611 --> 00:00:28.060
<v Speaker 1>ideas are considered controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you believe in God,</v>

10
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.270
<v Speaker 1>if you believe in family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you believe in having responsibility</v>

11
00:00:31.271 --> 00:00:34.720
<v Speaker 1>and traditional values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel ostracized by the community here.</v>

12
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.090
<v Speaker 1>I came from UC University of Calgary</v>
<v Speaker 1>over there.</v>

13
00:00:37.091 --> 00:00:39.070
<v Speaker 1>I didn't feel this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was more welcoming.</v>

14
00:00:39.071 --> 00:00:43.570
<v Speaker 1>Here I feel marginalized and I do feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>alone and when I see this,</v>

15
00:00:43.571 --> 00:00:45.610
<v Speaker 1>it disgusts me that here they can do</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

16
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.680
<v Speaker 1>but I couldn't go to their events,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do anything.</v>

17
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.410
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to shut up the disciplinary</v>
<v Speaker 1>committee for me,</v>

18
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.310
<v Speaker 1>but for them they can break windows to</v>
<v Speaker 1>God knows how old this building is and</v>

19
00:00:54.311 --> 00:00:58.060
<v Speaker 1>it's okay for them to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my question to you is now being here,</v>

20
00:00:58.061 --> 00:01:01.360
<v Speaker 1>experiencing this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm starting to second guess that maybe</v>

21
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.360
<v Speaker 1>the totalitarian Islamic regime that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was so,</v>

22
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about and critical of back in</v>

23
00:01:06.821 --> 00:01:10.270
<v Speaker 1>Iran isn't so bad when I have a choice</v>
<v Speaker 1>between having to be here and be</v>

24
00:01:10.271 --> 00:01:14.740
<v Speaker 1>oppressed and be there and at least have</v>
<v Speaker 1>my ideas be okay with the regime.</v>

25
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.540
<v Speaker 1>So my argument is if this free speech</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the arguments you guys are making</v>

26
00:01:19.541 --> 00:01:21.100
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't work,</v>

27
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.700
<v Speaker 1>would that not be the next step for</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to go towards totalitarianism?</v>

28
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.640
<v Speaker 1>If dialogue fails,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then isn't force of arms the only thing</v>

29
00:01:27.641 --> 00:01:29.920
<v Speaker 1>left?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can people compromise when they</v>

30
00:01:29.921 --> 00:01:31.750
<v Speaker 1>don't want to talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they want to yell?</v>

31
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:33.773
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

32
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.570
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

33
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.640
<v Speaker 3>I think you make a very good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we should fool ourselves.</v>

34
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.150
<v Speaker 3>This is about force and it is a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost a dare to suggest that that</v>

35
00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.450
<v Speaker 3>certain elements are not allowed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>enforce their view of the world and that</v>

36
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.930
<v Speaker 3>speaking contrary to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't that a front to those values and</v>

37
00:02:05.931 --> 00:02:07.250
<v Speaker 3>they won't shut you down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that,</v>

38
00:02:07.251 --> 00:02:08.930
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is what is at stake.</v>

39
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:10.490
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are,</v>

40
00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.300
<v Speaker 3>we are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are no longer really in a situation</v>

41
00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:18.860
<v Speaker 3>where this will all be resolved through</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of gentle,</v>

42
00:02:18.861 --> 00:02:23.861
<v Speaker 3>reasonable civil dialogue that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that happens on the side,</v>

43
00:02:23.871 --> 00:02:26.600
<v Speaker 3>but it's not real anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not really where the fight is</v>

44
00:02:26.601 --> 00:02:27.980
<v Speaker 3>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a,</v>

45
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.510
<v Speaker 3>an imposition of the force of the state</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it is skewed,</v>

46
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.600
<v Speaker 3>it is skewed a certain way and we are</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting to the point where a certain</v>

47
00:02:35.601 --> 00:02:39.520
<v Speaker 3>kind of language or certain kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 3>dialogue is,</v>

48
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.890
<v Speaker 3>is approved and all right and a certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind is not.</v>

49
00:02:42.891 --> 00:02:44.930
<v Speaker 3>And that is the campaign that is going</v>
<v Speaker 3>on to,</v>

50
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.070
<v Speaker 3>this is all part of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I have to say that,</v>

51
00:02:49.071 --> 00:02:54.071
<v Speaker 3>that your presence here and your</v>
<v Speaker 3>endorsement of this kind of event is the</v>

52
00:02:54.621 --> 00:02:59.560
<v Speaker 3>kind of thing that has the major</v>
<v Speaker 3>pushback to trend,</v>

53
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 3>but the trend</v>

54
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.680
<v Speaker 4>is continuing and is a very dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 4>one.</v>

55
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.050
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

56
00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:08.740
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a difficult moment in the life of this</v>

57
00:03:08.741 --> 00:03:09.574
<v Speaker 4>country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would you,</v>

58
00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.140
<v Speaker 4>would you say Jordan?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

59
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.320
<v Speaker 4>so some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some comments about,</v>

60
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.730
<v Speaker 4>about your career.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's say.</v>

61
00:03:15.731 --> 00:03:17.090
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you're a young mountain.</v>

62
00:03:17.091 --> 00:03:18.640
<v Speaker 4>And you've got lots of years ahead of</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

63
00:03:18.641 --> 00:03:21.100
<v Speaker 4>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to prepare for the war,</v>

64
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.020
<v Speaker 4>not the battle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

65
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.420
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because there's going to be many battles</v>

66
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.210
<v Speaker 4>for you personally and perhaps</v>
<v Speaker 4>politically and all of that.</v>

67
00:03:28.211 --> 00:03:31.570
<v Speaker 4>And so you want to make yourself as</v>
<v Speaker 4>articulate and educated as you can and</v>

68
00:03:31.571 --> 00:03:34.720
<v Speaker 4>you want to have patients.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say that there is no cause for</v>

69
00:03:34.721 --> 00:03:36.730
<v Speaker 4>despair,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

70
00:03:36.731 --> 00:03:37.870
<v Speaker 4>I believe that the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

71
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.950
<v Speaker 4>the people who are attempting to</v>
<v Speaker 4>radicalize our society and to transform</v>

72
00:03:41.951 --> 00:03:45.760
<v Speaker 4>it into a battleground of identity</v>
<v Speaker 4>politics are in the distinct minority.</v>

73
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.130
<v Speaker 4>And I think that I think that there is</v>
<v Speaker 4>no reason to assume that we can't push</v>

74
00:03:51.131 --> 00:03:53.590
<v Speaker 4>the devil back into the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>into the bottle,</v>

75
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.290
<v Speaker 4>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to push the genie back into the bottle.</v>

76
00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.820
<v Speaker 4>And so don't despair.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now from a personal perspective,</v>

77
00:04:00.821 --> 00:04:04.690
<v Speaker 4>it's like we've got lots of things to</v>
<v Speaker 4>learn and you've got lots of things to</v>

78
00:04:04.691 --> 00:04:08.830
<v Speaker 4>say and to write and you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>find now and then that you were imposed</v>

79
00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:11.290
<v Speaker 4>upon in a manner that you don't find</v>
<v Speaker 4>tolerable,</v>

80
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.071
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think,</v>

81
00:04:12.071 --> 00:04:13.450
<v Speaker 4>I can't live like this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

82
00:04:13.451 --> 00:04:15.550
<v Speaker 4>It's going to distress you in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well then,</v>

83
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.220
<v Speaker 4>then you've come across your moral</v>
<v Speaker 4>conundrum,</v>

84
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.160
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's specific to you and then you have</v>

85
00:04:21.161 --> 00:04:24.100
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's when you have to grow up and</v>

86
00:04:24.101 --> 00:04:27.070
<v Speaker 4>think strategically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you decide,</v>

87
00:04:27.071 --> 00:04:29.260
<v Speaker 4>are you willing to live under those</v>
<v Speaker 4>conditions?</v>

88
00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.470
<v Speaker 4>If you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you develop a strategy.</v>

89
00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:33.550
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

90
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.610
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to fight this.</v>

91
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.930
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to fight it carefully,</v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligently,</v>

92
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.970
<v Speaker 4>thoughtfully on multiple fronts and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 4>not going to back down and you don't</v>

93
00:04:45.971 --> 00:04:47.410
<v Speaker 4>make that decision lightly.</v>

94
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.670
<v Speaker 4>You know most things you should let blow</v>
<v Speaker 4>by you because there's not that much of</v>

95
00:04:51.671 --> 00:04:55.120
<v Speaker 4>you and there's lots of things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now and then you'll find a stumbling</v>

96
00:04:55.121 --> 00:04:57.550
<v Speaker 4>block that you can't get over it because</v>
<v Speaker 4>it hurts you.</v>

97
00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.030
<v Speaker 4>It damages your soul.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the right way to think about it.</v>

98
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.630
<v Speaker 4>Well then that's the time for you to put</v>
<v Speaker 4>your education to use.</v>

99
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.610
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you'll be able to do that.</v>

100
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.650
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't want to underestimate the</v>

101
00:05:08.651 --> 00:05:12.460
<v Speaker 4>utility of of deep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>forthright speech.</v>

102
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.280
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe that anything can stand</v>
<v Speaker 4>in its way.</v>

103
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.020
<v Speaker 4>It have the courage of your convictions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but don't give way to despair like this</v>

104
00:05:20.021 --> 00:05:22.180
<v Speaker 4>battle is by no means over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

105
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.660
<v Speaker 4>I know meets and it isn't even obvious</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the bad guys are winning,</v>

106
00:05:25.661 --> 00:05:27.310
<v Speaker 4>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

107
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.490
<v Speaker 4>I mean here we are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're having this talk.</v>

108
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.270
<v Speaker 4>The university came out forthrightly in</v>
<v Speaker 4>favor of free speech for.</v>

109
00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.860
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

110
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.500
<v Speaker 4>No one so far.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the questions today have been</v>

111
00:05:54.501 --> 00:05:58.250
<v Speaker 4>thoughtful and intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You seem like informed so like don't</v>

112
00:05:58.251 --> 00:06:01.100
<v Speaker 4>underestimate your strength.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

113
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.450
<v Speaker 4>and mcmaster just published a set of</v>
<v Speaker 4>guidelines governing this sort of</v>

114
00:06:05.451 --> 00:06:10.451
<v Speaker 4>behavior so that it will no longer be</v>
<v Speaker 4>acceptable to disrupt perfectly</v>

115
00:06:11.391 --> 00:06:14.000
<v Speaker 4>reasonable proceedings on university</v>
<v Speaker 4>campuses</v>

116
00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.830
<v Speaker 4>in the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the,</v>

117
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.450
<v Speaker 4>so the discussions like this can</v>
<v Speaker 4>continue properly.</v>

118
00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:25.190
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's definitely a place for a</v>
<v Speaker 4>give and take and for informed</v>

119
00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.670
<v Speaker 4>opposition let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a difference between</v>

120
00:06:28.671 --> 00:06:32.060
<v Speaker 4>informed opposition in child childish</v>
<v Speaker 4>grandstanding.</v>

121
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.040
<v Speaker 4>And I think people know the difference</v>
<v Speaker 4>between that.</v>

122
00:06:34.041 --> 00:06:36.890
<v Speaker 4>So don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't be desperate about it.</v>

123
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.970
<v Speaker 4>Pick your battles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A little courage goes a long way,</v>

124
00:06:40.971 --> 00:06:43.270
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because other people see it and</v>

125
00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:47.960
<v Speaker 3>there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is I think a silent majority out</v>

126
00:06:47.961 --> 00:06:52.961
<v Speaker 3>there that is silence and is scared,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if they see courage from somebody,</v>

127
00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.110
<v Speaker 3>they responded to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

128
00:06:57.111 --> 00:07:01.070
<v Speaker 3>I think you described lawyers in a way</v>
<v Speaker 3>that appealed to me once.</v>

129
00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.530
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I know that's rare,</v>

130
00:07:03.531 --> 00:07:07.100
<v Speaker 3>but</v>
<v Speaker 3>you said lawyers.</v>

131
00:07:07.101 --> 00:07:11.930
<v Speaker 3>I think these are the words you said</v>
<v Speaker 3>lawyers are difficult and emotionally</v>

132
00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:15.650
<v Speaker 3>stable and is the combination of those</v>
<v Speaker 3>two things.</v>

133
00:07:15.651 --> 00:07:20.000
<v Speaker 3>The willingness to be difficult but not</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be emotional about it.</v>

134
00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:20.721
<v Speaker 3>Don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>

135
00:07:20.721 --> 00:07:24.470
<v Speaker 3>don't wear your emotions to the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take a step back,</v>

136
00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:26.660
<v Speaker 3>engage in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say what you think.</v>

137
00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:29.480
<v Speaker 3>Be Courageous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but don't get wrapped up in it.</v>

138
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.980
<v Speaker 3>Don't be emotional about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

139
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:35.510
<v Speaker 3>retain your strength for the long haul.</v>

140
00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:36.980
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

141
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:38.840
<v Speaker 4>one of the things I've learned</v>
<v Speaker 4>strategically,</v>

142
00:07:38.841 --> 00:07:40.520
<v Speaker 4>and this is really worth thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 4>too,</v>

143
00:07:40.521 --> 00:07:44.780
<v Speaker 4>is that when you're engaged in a public</v>
<v Speaker 4>dispute like this,</v>

144
00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.540
<v Speaker 4>it's not obvious when things are going</v>
<v Speaker 4>your way.</v>

145
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:49.311
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you think,</v>

146
00:07:49.311 --> 00:07:51.410
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this protest is not such a good thing.</v>

147
00:07:51.411 --> 00:07:53.810
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't be so sure about that.</v>

148
00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.630
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's happened to me in the last 18</v>

149
00:07:56.631 --> 00:08:00.830
<v Speaker 4>months is that virtually every time that</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been attacked and some of the</v>

150
00:08:00.831 --> 00:08:04.100
<v Speaker 4>attacks have been quite well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't say brutal because we haven't</v>

151
00:08:04.101 --> 00:08:07.100
<v Speaker 4>got to that thank God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they've certainly been,</v>

152
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:10.760
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've taken me aback.</v>

153
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:11.623
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not,</v>

154
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:15.920
<v Speaker 4>it's not a straightforward thing to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a hall with this happened at mcmaster</v>

155
00:08:15.921 --> 00:08:20.810
<v Speaker 4>with 100 people yelling at you and</v>
<v Speaker 4>blaring air horns and all of that.</v>

156
00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:26.140
<v Speaker 4>But that wasn't a bad thing as it turned</v>
<v Speaker 4>out because it was filmed and it was put</v>

157
00:08:27.351 --> 00:08:31.730
<v Speaker 4>on Youtube and it was terrible for the</v>
<v Speaker 4>people who protested,</v>

158
00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:33.860
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't good.</v>

159
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:37.400
<v Speaker 4>And so you got to detach yourself to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

160
00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:38.990
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you say what you think and you're</v>

161
00:08:38.991 --> 00:08:41.360
<v Speaker 4>careful about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to have some short term</v>

162
00:08:41.361 --> 00:08:44.240
<v Speaker 4>effects and it's gonna have some medium</v>
<v Speaker 4>term effects and it's going to have some</v>

163
00:08:44.241 --> 00:08:46.940
<v Speaker 4>longterm effects.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things that you need to</v>

164
00:08:46.941 --> 00:08:47.840
<v Speaker 4>do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say,</v>

165
00:08:47.841 --> 00:08:51.230
<v Speaker 4>and this is an element of courage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is you have to have faith that the</v>

166
00:08:51.231 --> 00:08:56.231
<v Speaker 4>medium to longterm consequences of you</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying you have to say as clearly as</v>

167
00:08:56.911 --> 00:08:59.790
<v Speaker 4>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be positive and you have</v>

168
00:08:59.791 --> 00:09:02.460
<v Speaker 4>to act on that supposition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't know,</v>

169
00:09:02.461 --> 00:09:04.560
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't know that that's the</v>

170
00:09:04.561 --> 00:09:07.980
<v Speaker 4>existential leap of faith is you can't</v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

171
00:09:07.981 --> 00:09:12.870
<v Speaker 4>but you act anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And my experience has been that you</v>

172
00:09:12.871 --> 00:09:15.120
<v Speaker 4>don't wanna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to make judgment too</v>

173
00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:18.060
<v Speaker 4>quickly because it's not always clear</v>
<v Speaker 4>when things are going your way.</v>

174
00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:22.410
<v Speaker 4>So when you know you might stand up in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>class and say something that people</v>

175
00:09:22.411 --> 00:09:25.800
<v Speaker 4>react negatively to eat and you might</v>
<v Speaker 4>get pilloried for that by some people,</v>

176
00:09:25.801 --> 00:09:29.610
<v Speaker 4>but you never know who you're touching</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the crowd and you don't know how</v>

177
00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:32.430
<v Speaker 4>that's going to unfold across time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you have that might be a</v>

178
00:09:32.431 --> 00:09:35.880
<v Speaker 4>defining moment in someone else's life</v>
<v Speaker 4>to watch you stand up and say what you</v>

179
00:09:35.881 --> 00:09:40.140
<v Speaker 4>have to say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So don't underestimate the power of</v>

180
00:09:40.141 --> 00:09:42.730
<v Speaker 4>truth and courage really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

181
00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:49.960
<v Speaker 2>thank you.</v>
