1
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.340
<v Speaker 1>You have real life</v>

2
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.530
<v Speaker 1>first order abstractions.</v>

3
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.600
<v Speaker 1>If someone's telling you the story</v>

4
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:30.880
<v Speaker 1>because they're going to tell you</v>

5
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.930
<v Speaker 1>what's the difference between what's relevant and what is it rather,</v>

6
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.280
<v Speaker 1>why.</v>

7
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.930
<v Speaker 1>You just know when that happens,</v>

8
00:00:43.931 --> 00:00:45.820
<v Speaker 1>you know that the person is good at telling a story.</v>

9
00:00:45.821 --> 00:00:49.570
<v Speaker 1>So what they're essentially doing is they're laying down your experience but not</v>

10
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.010
<v Speaker 1>there's select group about and that's what needs a boring story.</v>

11
00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:55.700
<v Speaker 1>They do first order,</v>

12
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.320
<v Speaker 1>first order the fictionalization in some sense they say,</v>

13
00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.650
<v Speaker 1>well here's a bunch of interesting things that happened last week and it was</v>

14
00:01:02.651 --> 00:01:03.131
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

15
00:01:03.131 --> 00:01:06.990
<v Speaker 1>Things have to have some dairies when your body in some way or you're not going</v>

16
00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:08.850
<v Speaker 1>to find them interesting and have a,</v>

17
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.220
<v Speaker 1>you have to know to extract something of value at that point,</v>

18
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.030
<v Speaker 1>a point of wind direction if his suffering.</v>

19
00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:16.340
<v Speaker 1>So that's what makes you,</v>

20
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.830
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting and then you might think,</v>

21
00:01:17.831 --> 00:01:19.500
<v Speaker 1>well that's just the boring story coming.</v>

22
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.830
<v Speaker 1>But then you have people who are brilliant yet say writing novels or we're</v>

23
00:01:23.831 --> 00:01:24.670
<v Speaker 1>producing movies,</v>

24
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.330
<v Speaker 1>screenplays,</v>

25
00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.310
<v Speaker 1>and they're way better than a normal person that extracting what's important,</v>

26
00:01:29.311 --> 00:01:30.580
<v Speaker 1>like the geniuses at it.</v>

27
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.760
<v Speaker 1>And so they don't just extract that from their life.</v>

28
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:34.600
<v Speaker 1>What's relevant?</v>

29
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.051
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

30
00:01:35.051 --> 00:01:38.890
<v Speaker 1>They look at a whole bunch of people and then how did distilled it into a single</v>

31
00:01:38.891 --> 00:01:42.570
<v Speaker 1>characters and then they extract out from them what's relevant and interesting</v>

32
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.350
<v Speaker 1>and they lay on this portrayal,</v>

33
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.070
<v Speaker 1>good versus evil and transformation.</v>

34
00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.660
<v Speaker 1>It's transfixing.</v>

35
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.260
<v Speaker 1>That's what we do.</v>

36
00:01:53.261 --> 00:01:56.890
<v Speaker 1>We with her religious stories since the beginning of time,</v>

37
00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.730
<v Speaker 1>we'd be watching how we may hate.</v>

38
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.090
<v Speaker 1>We've been extracting the patterns of that application and we'd been presented</v>

39
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.910
<v Speaker 1>in dramatic form and those stories are at the bottom of cognitive.</v>

40
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:11.793
<v Speaker 1>Our church.</v>

41
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.040
<v Speaker 1>That's what are,</v>

42
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.140
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

43
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.940
<v Speaker 1>it's within that structure that our world views rest and that is roughly</v>

44
00:02:18.941 --> 00:02:19.511
<v Speaker 1>speaking,</v>

45
00:02:19.511 --> 00:02:20.710
<v Speaker 1>it's the dreamer.</v>

46
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.610
<v Speaker 1>Good versus evil on the landscape of chaos versus order.</v>

47
00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.630
<v Speaker 1>Order be that place that you're familiar with and comfortable with.</v>

48
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:29.450
<v Speaker 1>The home,</v>

49
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.020
<v Speaker 1>the heart,</v>

50
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.581
<v Speaker 1>the family,</v>

51
00:02:30.581 --> 00:02:31.414
<v Speaker 1>that country,</v>

52
00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.253
<v Speaker 1>the state,</v>

53
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.850
<v Speaker 1>the well organized community,</v>

54
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.410
<v Speaker 1>the [inaudible] community,</v>

55
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.700
<v Speaker 1>the world's city,</v>

56
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.520
<v Speaker 1>the places that people have always lived.</v>

57
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.660
<v Speaker 1>And then what's the upside of that?</v>

58
00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.040
<v Speaker 1>And that's our reality.</v>

59
00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:43.780
<v Speaker 1>That's the landscape.</v>

60
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.471
<v Speaker 1>Within math,</v>

61
00:02:44.471 --> 00:02:48.580
<v Speaker 1>there's a drama group versus evil and that's our fundamental religious</v>

62
00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.050
<v Speaker 1>conception of the world.</v>

63
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.921
<v Speaker 1>And you might take,</v>

64
00:02:50.921 --> 00:02:52.660
<v Speaker 1>well you don't believe in that,</v>

65
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.220
<v Speaker 1>but that's not true.</v>

66
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.950
<v Speaker 1>You do believe in that because if you didn't believe it,</v>

67
00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.210
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't be human.</v>

68
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.660
<v Speaker 1>Because to human is to live in that world,</v>

69
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.060
<v Speaker 1>metaphysically is very difficult to say it.</v>

70
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.120
<v Speaker 1>This is reality actually chaos versus order with the drum out of good and evil</v>

71
00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:12.350
<v Speaker 1>being played down at that.</v>

72
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.380
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very difficult question to answer,</v>

73
00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:19.270
<v Speaker 1>but one thing I can tell you is that you act like it is and your brain is</v>

74
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.860
<v Speaker 1>organized like idiots and so that's pretty powerful evidence that there's</v>

75
00:03:23.861 --> 00:03:27.670
<v Speaker 1>something going on that's vaguely related to reality and not just to</v>

76
00:03:27.671 --> 00:03:28.504
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>

77
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.533
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

78
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you if you're a sequence of very old stories and then I'm</v>

79
00:03:41.411 --> 00:03:42.700
<v Speaker 1>going to tell you about Ypo,</v>

80
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.730
<v Speaker 1>related to mass murderers because I already said that if you want to answer the</v>

81
00:03:48.641 --> 00:03:49.780
<v Speaker 1>most difficult question,</v>

82
00:03:49.781 --> 00:03:54.460
<v Speaker 1>you have to go with the deepest possible level and the deepest possible level</v>

83
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.930
<v Speaker 1>isn't what you know.</v>

84
00:03:55.931 --> 00:03:58.870
<v Speaker 1>You know it's what you act out.</v>

85
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.870
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it's what you start to represent,</v>

86
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.550
<v Speaker 1>but you don't know what it is yet.</v>

87
00:04:03.551 --> 00:04:08.551
<v Speaker 1>It's too profound once to Bizible in some sense to be part of a fully</v>

88
00:04:08.651 --> 00:04:09.700
<v Speaker 1>articulating knowledge.</v>

89
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.690
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that see wonderful things that cardio was attempted to do,</v>

90
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.500
<v Speaker 1>I think he was,</v>

91
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he was the greatest thinker of the 20th century,</v>

92
00:04:20.321 --> 00:04:21.310
<v Speaker 1>but he certainly,</v>

93
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.120
<v Speaker 1>he was certainly up there and I'll tell you what he was up when he took Freud's</v>

94
00:04:28.061 --> 00:04:33.061
<v Speaker 1>idea that you could look at fantasy and extract out new knowledge,</v>

95
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.800
<v Speaker 1>that idea seriously and then you thought,</v>

96
00:04:35.801 --> 00:04:38.350
<v Speaker 1>well dreams that people have in your fantasies,</v>

97
00:04:38.351 --> 00:04:41.450
<v Speaker 1>they have our length of mythologies that they use in their culture.</v>

98
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.600
<v Speaker 1>So the dream is to be individual,</v>

99
00:04:43.601 --> 00:04:47.800
<v Speaker 1>like the myth is to the culture and you'll believe that we existed within</v>

100
00:04:47.801 --> 00:04:48.970
<v Speaker 1>Stuart's if we'd been,</v>

101
00:04:48.971 --> 00:04:49.804
<v Speaker 1>I've described it.</v>

102
00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.610
<v Speaker 1>I think the evidence for that by the way,</v>

103
00:04:51.611 --> 00:04:52.680
<v Speaker 1>is in controvert.</v>

104
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.750
<v Speaker 1>I think Kenny serious psychologist who knows anything about how the brain</v>

105
00:04:58.751 --> 00:05:03.751
<v Speaker 1>functions in any deep sense is to admit that the manner in which we construct</v>

106
00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.890
<v Speaker 1>the world looks like in heritage now.</v>

107
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.260
<v Speaker 1>And not everyone agrees with that,</v>

108
00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.560
<v Speaker 1>but the psychologist that I've come across who I think are the deepest of the</v>

109
00:05:13.561 --> 00:05:18.561
<v Speaker 1>thinkers have drawn that conclusion and widely disparate fields ranging from</v>

110
00:05:19.091 --> 00:05:21.920
<v Speaker 1>artificial intelligence to the analysis of dreams.</v>

111
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.700
<v Speaker 1>It's something that's emerged across this.</v>

112
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:33.870
<v Speaker 1>So here's where it was up.</v>

113
00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.970
<v Speaker 1>The first day he paused what I just told you about this extension of Freud's</v>

114
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:42.790
<v Speaker 1>vision of treats.</v>

115
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.400
<v Speaker 1>The second I think there was that are the way they think about the world is</v>

116
00:05:48.401 --> 00:05:49.810
<v Speaker 1>advantage stories.</v>

117
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:58.170
<v Speaker 1>Third idea was that the stories were deeply of who we are and I'm only</v>

118
00:05:59.391 --> 00:06:04.391
<v Speaker 1>culturally but in the deepest possible biological sense wasn't the mirror</v>

119
00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:06.500
<v Speaker 1>armature,</v>

120
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.260
<v Speaker 1>socio cultural construction.</v>

121
00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:12.760
<v Speaker 1>And I also think the evidence for that just overwhelming and crystal court,</v>

122
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.150
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

123
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.840
<v Speaker 1>our fundamental biology is very much like that of the fundamental biology of</v>

124
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.810
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>

125
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:21.261
<v Speaker 1>mammals,</v>

126
00:06:21.261 --> 00:06:22.100
<v Speaker 1>social mammals,</v>

127
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.110
<v Speaker 1>the drugs that work on us,</v>

128
00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.450
<v Speaker 1>the site,</v>

129
00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:26.141
<v Speaker 1>the drugs that work.</v>

130
00:06:26.141 --> 00:06:26.740
<v Speaker 1>Psychologically,</v>

131
00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.930
<v Speaker 1>I'll have to have very similar effects on animals like rats for example.</v>

132
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:34.310
<v Speaker 1>We share biological history with animals</v>

133
00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:41.060
<v Speaker 1>and to think about us as some of them divorced from our biological fundamental</v>

134
00:06:41.871 --> 00:06:43.590
<v Speaker 1>is loosely,</v>

135
00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:45.830
<v Speaker 1>you know that you know,</v>

136
00:06:45.831 --> 00:06:48.920
<v Speaker 1>that might what you don't have to talk about when you talk to someone,</v>

137
00:06:48.921 --> 00:06:51.050
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to talk about what anger is.</v>

138
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:52.930
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to talk about what theories.</v>

139
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.620
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to talk about what jealousy is.</v>

140
00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.430
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to talk about what Hungary's like describe your particular</v>

141
00:06:58.431 --> 00:06:58.671
<v Speaker 1>hunger,</v>

142
00:06:58.671 --> 00:07:02.270
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have to make a case for the existence of hunger,</v>

143
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:02.930
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

144
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:07.010
<v Speaker 1>There's all these fundamental human experiences that are part and parcel of</v>

145
00:07:07.011 --> 00:07:11.330
<v Speaker 1>being embodied in the manner that we're embodied that are beyond discussion</v>

146
00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:11.631
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

147
00:07:11.631 --> 00:07:14.540
<v Speaker 1>So self-evident pain is one you don't,</v>

148
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:19.690
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to convince someone else of the existence of pain or suffering.</v>

149
00:07:20.471 --> 00:07:23.270
<v Speaker 1>I could particularly alcohol in that regard.</v>

150
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.990
<v Speaker 1>And so we have those fundamental ways of orienting ourselves to the world that</v>

151
00:07:26.991 --> 00:07:28.360
<v Speaker 1>are deeply rooted biologically.</v>

152
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:31.850
<v Speaker 1>They manifest themselves in our stories and that makes up part of our nature.</v>

153
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.840
<v Speaker 1>And we have to figure out how to cope with those fundamental realities of life.</v>

154
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:40.780
<v Speaker 1>And the way we do that is by learning to act in particular ways in the world are</v>

155
00:07:40.781 --> 00:07:40.971
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

156
00:07:40.971 --> 00:07:42.050
<v Speaker 1>You can strange ways.</v>
