1
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.400
<v Speaker 1>It's the approach that Dostoyevsky talked to his characters when he wrote this</v>

2
00:00:10.401 --> 00:00:14.750
<v Speaker 1>great novels and it's also the approach that all great novelists taped to their</v>

3
00:00:14.751 --> 00:00:16.970
<v Speaker 1>character because if you're a great novelist,</v>

4
00:00:16.971 --> 00:00:19.400
<v Speaker 1>you put yourself inside the head of the murderer,</v>

5
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:20.400
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

6
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.360
<v Speaker 1>and Dostoyevsky was great punishment.</v>

7
00:00:23.361 --> 00:00:24.194
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

8
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.350
<v Speaker 1>the main character was going to cough is a lawsuit and he's all upset because</v>

9
00:00:30.351 --> 00:00:35.060
<v Speaker 1>he's lost his faith in God and he's got all these weird ideas that emerged in</v>

10
00:00:35.061 --> 00:00:38.030
<v Speaker 1>Europe at the end of the 18 hundreds that if there's no god,</v>

11
00:00:38.031 --> 00:00:39.380
<v Speaker 1>everything is permitted,</v>

12
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:40.670
<v Speaker 1>and so he's thinking,</v>

13
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:41.151
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

14
00:00:41.151 --> 00:00:42.980
<v Speaker 1>am I moral just because I'm a coward,</v>

15
00:00:42.981 --> 00:00:45.440
<v Speaker 1>which was a Nietzschean proposition actually meets,</v>

16
00:00:45.441 --> 00:00:48.260
<v Speaker 1>you said most morality is cowardice.</v>

17
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.120
<v Speaker 1>He didn't say that morality was cowardice.</v>

18
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.560
<v Speaker 1>He said most of the time when people are being cowardly,</v>

19
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.840
<v Speaker 1>they pretend that it's moral,</v>

20
00:00:53.841 --> 00:00:54.980
<v Speaker 1>which is absolutely right.</v>

21
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.113
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

22
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.090
<v Speaker 1>he's wrestling with this idea that,</v>

23
00:00:59.091 --> 00:00:59.360
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

24
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.500
<v Speaker 1>morality is just cowardice and once fundamental beliefs have disappeared,</v>

25
00:01:03.501 --> 00:01:06.290
<v Speaker 1>you can do anything you want and the only thing that's there to stop you is your</v>

26
00:01:06.291 --> 00:01:07.124
<v Speaker 1>own fear.</v>

27
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.280
<v Speaker 1>So that's rattling around in the back of his head.</v>

28
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.190
<v Speaker 1>Now at the same time,</v>

29
00:01:10.191 --> 00:01:14.600
<v Speaker 1>he's more or less starving to death and his sister is going to essentially</v>

30
00:01:14.601 --> 00:01:18.180
<v Speaker 1>prostitute herself to raise enough money so that he can stay in law school.</v>

31
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.410
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

32
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.490
<v Speaker 1>it's not exactly that.</v>

33
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.790
<v Speaker 1>She's going to go off and marry this guy that she doesn't love who's quite rich</v>

34
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.070
<v Speaker 1>and she's going to do that to keep him in law school.</v>

35
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.890
<v Speaker 1>So that's sort of sucks,</v>

36
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.581
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

37
00:01:28.581 --> 00:01:29.780
<v Speaker 1>he's not very happy about that.</v>

38
00:01:29.781 --> 00:01:34.781
<v Speaker 1>And then he's living in this horrible flop house and the woman who runs it is</v>

39
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.670
<v Speaker 1>Dostoyevsky sets this up quite nicely.</v>

40
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.720
<v Speaker 1>She's the sort of person that if she was run over by a horse cart,</v>

41
00:01:41.721 --> 00:01:43.250
<v Speaker 1>everyone would be pleased.</v>

42
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:44.383
<v Speaker 1>She's grasping,</v>

43
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.450
<v Speaker 1>admitted at miserly and horrible and mean and malevolent and cruel and all those</v>

44
00:01:49.491 --> 00:01:49.731
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

45
00:01:49.731 --> 00:01:51.050
<v Speaker 1>And then to make it even worse,</v>

46
00:01:51.051 --> 00:01:55.220
<v Speaker 1>she has this niece who isn't very bright that she basically treats as a slave</v>

47
00:01:55.221 --> 00:01:57.170
<v Speaker 1>and tortures in orders around all the time.</v>

48
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.930
<v Speaker 1>And then she has all these people who are living in her building,</v>

49
00:01:59.931 --> 00:02:03.050
<v Speaker 1>which she doesn't take care of and she's just grasping money out of them all the</v>

50
00:02:03.051 --> 00:02:03.301
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

51
00:02:03.301 --> 00:02:04.400
<v Speaker 1>And she'd have to do anything with money.</v>

52
00:02:04.401 --> 00:02:08.930
<v Speaker 1>She just puts it in a little chest and she lives like a on bread crumbs and</v>

53
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.071
<v Speaker 1>dust.</v>

54
00:02:10.071 --> 00:02:10.904
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

55
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.120
<v Speaker 1>so Dostoyevsky's very careful to set the situation up.</v>

56
00:02:14.121 --> 00:02:14.451
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

57
00:02:14.451 --> 00:02:15.284
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

58
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.780
<v Speaker 1>is there such a thing as right or wrong?</v>

59
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.840
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] he's pretty positive about that.</v>

60
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.290
<v Speaker 1>Plus he's hungry and he's drinking too much and you know he doesn't eat</v>

61
00:02:24.291 --> 00:02:24.860
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>

62
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:25.910
<v Speaker 1>Well that's why he's hungry.</v>

63
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.940
<v Speaker 1>And so his head is a little on the adult side and then he's got this terrible</v>

64
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.030
<v Speaker 1>moral conundrum.</v>

65
00:02:32.031 --> 00:02:34.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's this horrible woman she's torturing and her niece,</v>

66
00:02:34.941 --> 00:02:38.990
<v Speaker 1>and then his sister is going to go into a loveless marriage and he can't stay in</v>

67
00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:39.824
<v Speaker 1>law school.</v>

68
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.290
<v Speaker 1>And so we rationalize it.</v>

69
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.631
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

70
00:02:41.631 --> 00:02:42.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

71
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.951
<v Speaker 1>here's a solution,</v>

72
00:02:42.951 --> 00:02:43.430
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

73
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.140
<v Speaker 1>I'll just get rid of that old woman.</v>

74
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.520
<v Speaker 1>No one's gonna miss her.</v>

75
00:02:46.521 --> 00:02:49.160
<v Speaker 1>Now I'll be doing the world a favor by getting rid of her.</v>

76
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.440
<v Speaker 1>And then I'll take your money.</v>

77
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.500
<v Speaker 1>And then my sister doesn't have to become a prostitute,</v>

78
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.351
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>

79
00:02:55.351 --> 00:02:57.740
<v Speaker 1>And I get to go to law school and I'm going to be a good guy.</v>

80
00:02:57.741 --> 00:02:59.000
<v Speaker 1>And so poof.</v>

81
00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.591
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

82
00:02:59.591 --> 00:03:01.330
<v Speaker 1>And if there's no ultimate right and wrong,</v>

83
00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:02.460
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

84
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:03.293
<v Speaker 1>I'm sad.</v>

85
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.840
<v Speaker 1>It's an instrumental argument.</v>

86
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:05.674
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

87
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:06.071
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

88
00:03:06.071 --> 00:03:07.390
<v Speaker 1>so he kills her.</v>

89
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:09.753
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

90
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.640
<v Speaker 1>and you have to read the book if you want the rest of the story.</v>

91
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.720
<v Speaker 1>Suffice it to say that things do not go exactly as he predicted.</v>

92
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.340
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing he figured this out is that the person you are before you hit</v>

93
00:03:24.341 --> 00:03:28.870
<v Speaker 1>someone with someone with an ax and the person you are immediately after you hit</v>

94
00:03:28.871 --> 00:03:31.680
<v Speaker 1>someone with an ax or not the same persons.</v>

95
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.311
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

96
00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:38.311
<v Speaker 1>he assumes constancy of identity across every experience that turns out to be</v>

97
00:03:38.321 --> 00:03:39.370
<v Speaker 1>seriously wrong.</v>

98
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.380
<v Speaker 1>So Dostoyevsky man,</v>

99
00:03:41.381 --> 00:03:42.214
<v Speaker 1>and he does such a,</v>

100
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.750
<v Speaker 1>it's a terrifying book.</v>

101
00:03:43.751 --> 00:03:45.790
<v Speaker 1>It's the most psychologically accurate book I ever read,</v>

102
00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:46.624
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

103
00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.920
<v Speaker 1>But the reason I'm telling you about it is this is what made Dostoyevsky's so</v>

104
00:03:50.921 --> 00:03:51.551
<v Speaker 1>courageous.</v>

105
00:03:51.551 --> 00:03:52.384
<v Speaker 1>It's like he,</v>

106
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.390
<v Speaker 1>he generated up a murderer who is basically him as a young man and he gave this</v>

107
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.770
<v Speaker 1>kid every reason to murder every,</v>

108
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:02.111
<v Speaker 1>and he,</v>

109
00:04:02.111 --> 00:04:02.591
<v Speaker 1>everyone,</v>

110
00:04:02.591 --> 00:04:03.300
<v Speaker 1>he could think up,</v>

111
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.090
<v Speaker 1>he tried to make the case for murder as strong as he could possibly make it.</v>

112
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.870
<v Speaker 1>So he wasn't generating,</v>

113
00:04:08.871 --> 00:04:09.341
<v Speaker 1>not some,</v>

114
00:04:09.341 --> 00:04:10.174
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

115
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.790
<v Speaker 1>two dimensional bad guy.</v>

116
00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.100
<v Speaker 1>And then he has the,</v>

117
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.360
<v Speaker 1>then he has the argument.</v>
