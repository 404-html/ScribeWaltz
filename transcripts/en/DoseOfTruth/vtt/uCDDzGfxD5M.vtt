1
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.860
Were the Nazis left wig?

2
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.320
That's a good question.

3
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:14.610
It depends.

4
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.460
See the problem with any question that says is a,

5
00:00:17.461 --> 00:00:20.250
B is a equivalent to be,

6
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.250
is that it depends on how you define a and B.

7
00:00:23.251 --> 00:00:23.491
Right?

8
00:00:23.491 --> 00:00:25.320
And I'm not trying to weasel out of the question.

9
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:26.221
I'm very,

10
00:00:26.221 --> 00:00:27.054
very,

11
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:27.990
uh,

12
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.010
serious about that.

13
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.480
The Nazis regarded themselves as national socialists,

14
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:33.841
you know,

15
00:00:33.841 --> 00:00:34.674
so they,

16
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.160
they,

17
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.980
they weren't free market capitalists,

18
00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:38.401
let's say.

19
00:00:38.401 --> 00:00:42.180
So they certainly weren't right wingers in the way that free market capitalists

20
00:00:42.181 --> 00:00:42.901
are right wingers,

21
00:00:42.901 --> 00:00:44.910
even though they're probably more centrist.

22
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:46.303
Um,

23
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.900
they differed from the international socialists,

24
00:00:48.901 --> 00:00:53.010
which were the Marxists because they were much more concerned with national

25
00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:54.840
identity and racial identity.

26
00:00:54.841 --> 00:00:59.841
And to the degree that you regard nationalism and racial identity as primarily

27
00:01:00.121 --> 00:01:01.260
right wing views,

28
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.390
then the Nazis would have been right wing.

29
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.010
So let's say that they,

30
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.780
maybe they pulled from the worst of both extremes,

31
00:01:08.781 --> 00:01:09.720
something like that.

32
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.280
But I do think it's reasonable to note that they're extreme nationalism and

33
00:01:14.281 --> 00:01:18.960
ethnocentrism and racial identity probably has more in common with the radical

34
00:01:18.961 --> 00:01:21.570
right that it does with the radical left,

35
00:01:21.571 --> 00:01:24.660
which tends to be utopian universal.

36
00:01:24.661 --> 00:01:25.494
So,

37
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:26.623
um,

38
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.090
one of the things I thought would be an interesting research project would be to

39
00:01:30.091 --> 00:01:35.091
take like a hundred Nazi policies and to turn them into a questionnaire and ask

40
00:01:35.131 --> 00:01:40.131
people either how much they agree with them after I figured out whether they

41
00:01:40.231 --> 00:01:41.850
were left or right wing to begin with,

42
00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:45.960
or whether they thought the policies were representative of the left or the

43
00:01:45.961 --> 00:01:46.650
right.

44
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.270
Because that could be studied empirically.

45
00:01:48.271 --> 00:01:49.620
And I don't think anyone's done it,

46
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.390
but that would be a very interesting,

47
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.253
uh,

48
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.360
that would be a very interesting research project.
