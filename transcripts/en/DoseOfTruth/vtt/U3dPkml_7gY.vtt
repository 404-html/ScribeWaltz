1
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:08.951
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

2
00:00:08.951 --> 00:00:11.860
<v Speaker 1>I know that I have to ask this because this is one of the,</v>

3
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.750
<v Speaker 1>I've seen you answer this question,</v>

4
00:00:13.751 --> 00:00:15.500
<v Speaker 1>is that do you believe in God?</v>

5
00:00:15.501 --> 00:00:20.180
<v Speaker 1>And I saw a youtube video with you when you said that you didn't like the</v>

6
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.350
<v Speaker 1>question because you were,</v>

7
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:22.940
<v Speaker 1>you were being boxed in.</v>

8
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:24.241
<v Speaker 1>And I sort of,</v>

9
00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:24.321
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

10
00:00:24.321 --> 00:00:28.900
<v Speaker 1>I felt that because one of the things me and my wife had been wrestling with is</v>

11
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.780
<v Speaker 1>we've talked a lot about this.</v>

12
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.470
<v Speaker 1>What do we mean when we say that we believe in God because in Sweden to be</v>

13
00:00:36.471 --> 00:00:37.304
<v Speaker 1>Swedish,</v>

14
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.893
<v Speaker 1>to be Christian,</v>

15
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.020
<v Speaker 1>it was sort of what it means today to say that you are Swedish.</v>

16
00:00:42.021 --> 00:00:43.460
<v Speaker 1>So if you said that you were a Christian,</v>

17
00:00:43.461 --> 00:00:45.410
<v Speaker 1>you were sort of a good family father,</v>

18
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.510
<v Speaker 1>you had a lot of values within that being like a good Christian man is.</v>

19
00:00:50.511 --> 00:00:53.380
<v Speaker 1>So today when you say you're a good Swedish brand,</v>

20
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.223
<v Speaker 1>perhaps,</v>

21
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.060
<v Speaker 1>so it used to mean a lot more,</v>

22
00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.380
<v Speaker 1>but then you had the,</v>

23
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.590
<v Speaker 1>the Evangelical Christians,</v>

24
00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:01.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

25
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.420
<v Speaker 1>criticizing exactly this and saying that you are lost contact with God and then</v>

26
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.760
<v Speaker 1>they meant it in a much smaller sense.</v>

27
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.690
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

28
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.430
<v Speaker 2>And so they tend to confuse the biblical stories with lit with empirical</v>

29
00:01:13.431 --> 00:01:14.264
<v Speaker 2>history.</v>

30
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

31
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.320
<v Speaker 2>and it's not surprising they do that because they're trying to defend their</v>

32
00:01:18.321 --> 00:01:19.220
<v Speaker 2>faith against,</v>

33
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.000
<v Speaker 2>let's call it the postmodern assault or even the modernist assault for that</v>

34
00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:23.271
<v Speaker 2>matter.</v>

35
00:01:23.271 --> 00:01:25.690
<v Speaker 2>I have some sympathy with their motivations,</v>

36
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.380
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is,</v>

37
00:01:27.381 --> 00:01:32.381
<v Speaker 2>is that they don't understand that not all truth is empirical truth in in fact</v>

38
00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:36.680
<v Speaker 2>the fundamental truths as far as I could tell paradoxically enough our</v>

39
00:01:36.681 --> 00:01:37.514
<v Speaker 2>Darwinian,</v>

40
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.110
<v Speaker 2>and they actually line up with religious truths,</v>

41
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.640
<v Speaker 2>which is the point that I've been trying to make when I discussed this.</v>

42
00:01:43.641 --> 00:01:45.590
<v Speaker 2>Such issues with people like Sam Harris.</v>

43
00:01:45.591 --> 00:01:47.510
<v Speaker 2>Like Sam is a very,</v>

44
00:01:47.511 --> 00:01:48.560
<v Speaker 2>very smart guy,</v>

45
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.570
<v Speaker 2>but he's,</v>

46
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.120
<v Speaker 2>he worships the intellect.</v>

47
00:01:53.121 --> 00:01:54.410
<v Speaker 2>That's the first thing I would say.</v>

48
00:01:54.411 --> 00:01:58.730
<v Speaker 2>And the second thing is that I was never able to push him to his solution.</v>

49
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.670
<v Speaker 2>He'd never let me go there because you know,</v>

50
00:02:01.671 --> 00:02:06.500
<v Speaker 2>his idea is that we could rationally order society so that the wellbeing of</v>

51
00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:08.000
<v Speaker 2>people was maximized.</v>

52
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.601
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

53
00:02:08.601 --> 00:02:10.130
<v Speaker 2>he even said to,</v>

54
00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.253
<v Speaker 2>I think it was,</v>

55
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.840
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember which interview it was,</v>

56
00:02:14.841 --> 00:02:18.290
<v Speaker 2>but he said explicitly to the person that he was interviewing,</v>

57
00:02:18.291 --> 00:02:22.430
<v Speaker 2>that he could sit down right now and come up with a religious system that was</v>

58
00:02:22.431 --> 00:02:23.390
<v Speaker 2>much more rational,</v>

59
00:02:23.391 --> 00:02:27.020
<v Speaker 2>inappropriate than any of the ones that have that have existed to date.</v>

60
00:02:27.021 --> 00:02:27.471
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>

61
00:02:27.471 --> 00:02:27.800
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

62
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

63
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.820
<v Speaker 2>you're falling right into that rationalist Utopian pitfall there.</v>

64
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.421
<v Speaker 2>Your nurse,</v>

65
00:02:32.421 --> 00:02:33.350
<v Speaker 2>not that smart.</v>

66
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.550
<v Speaker 2>No one can do that.</v>

67
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.080
<v Speaker 2>And as soon as you do it,</v>

68
00:02:36.081 --> 00:02:37.610
<v Speaker 2>you end up where the socialists,</v>

69
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.650
<v Speaker 2>like the radical Soviet socialists or the Nazi utopians ended up,</v>

70
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.570
<v Speaker 1>we will be speaking as grown by now though.</v>

71
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.501
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

72
00:02:46.501 --> 00:02:47.334
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

73
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.700
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

74
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.410
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

75
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.760
<v Speaker 1>Except for word restaurant language than,</v>

76
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:51.683
<v Speaker 1>than Swedish.</v>

77
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.003
<v Speaker 1>Much more.</v>

78
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.250
<v Speaker 1>Most languages are.</v>

79
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:55.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

80
00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.541
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

81
00:02:55.541 --> 00:02:55.811
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

82
00:02:55.811 --> 00:02:56.410
<v Speaker 2>and that it's,</v>

83
00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.790
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

84
00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:58.151
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

85
00:02:58.151 --> 00:03:02.470
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I really about Dostoyevsky is that this was in notes from</v>

86
00:03:02.471 --> 00:03:03.041
<v Speaker 2>underground.</v>

87
00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:03.874
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

88
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.320
<v Speaker 2>he just states it very clearly.</v>

89
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:05.651
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

90
00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:06.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

91
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.400
<v Speaker 2>the one thing that you cannot claim about the history of the world and he meets</v>

92
00:03:09.401 --> 00:03:13.960
<v Speaker 2>the history of being is that it's rational and it isn't that he's criticizing</v>

93
00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:17.050
<v Speaker 2>the idea that you could use scientists,</v>

94
00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:22.051
<v Speaker 2>scientific investigation and rationality to lay out a clear representation of</v>

95
00:03:22.061 --> 00:03:23.110
<v Speaker 2>objective reality.</v>

96
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.370
<v Speaker 2>What he's saying is that if you take the terrible suffering and malevolence into</v>

97
00:03:27.371 --> 00:03:29.320
<v Speaker 2>account as fundamental realities,</v>

98
00:03:29.321 --> 00:03:34.321
<v Speaker 2>that a rationalist perspective is absolutely insufficient to tell the story.</v>

99
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.823
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

100
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.150
<v Speaker 2>there's no doubt about that.</v>

101
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.230
<v Speaker 2>It's just rationality just breaks down in the face of those things.</v>

102
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.590
<v Speaker 2>It hits an obstacle that it cannot contend with.</v>

103
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.350
<v Speaker 2>So you need something else.</v>

104
00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:48.190
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

105
00:03:48.191 --> 00:03:50.680
<v Speaker 2>there's this great image of Christ as Pantokrator,</v>

106
00:03:50.681 --> 00:03:51.071
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

107
00:03:51.071 --> 00:03:52.000
<v Speaker 2>very old image.</v>

108
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.923
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

109
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.930
<v Speaker 2>fortunately can't remember which cathedral it's represented in,</v>

110
00:03:55.931 --> 00:03:59.860
<v Speaker 2>but it's a great image and I'm having one of them carved for me right now.</v>

111
00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.420
<v Speaker 2>It's so,</v>

112
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.950
<v Speaker 2>it's a medieval image of Christ and his face is divided into two halves.</v>

113
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.840
<v Speaker 2>So it's very asymmetrical and one half the eyes are different than the facial</v>

114
00:04:10.841 --> 00:04:12.100
<v Speaker 2>expression is different than the other.</v>

115
00:04:12.101 --> 00:04:12.910
<v Speaker 2>And he's also,</v>

116
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.390
<v Speaker 2>he's on portrayed on the top of the Dome and holding a book.</v>

117
00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.460
<v Speaker 2>So the book is sacred,</v>

118
00:04:18.461 --> 00:04:18.731
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

119
00:04:18.731 --> 00:04:20.980
<v Speaker 2>So that's a great idea that the book is sacred.</v>

120
00:04:20.981 --> 00:04:22.180
<v Speaker 2>That's a great idea,</v>

121
00:04:22.181 --> 00:04:22.900
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

122
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.640
<v Speaker 2>And the idea that the word is sacred,</v>

123
00:04:24.641 --> 00:04:29.641
<v Speaker 2>but then the picture also represents human beings as creatures with one foot in</v>

124
00:04:29.951 --> 00:04:30.784
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

125
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:31.713
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

126
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.800
<v Speaker 2>in the profane and one foot in the sacred or one foot in the finite and one foot</v>

127
00:04:35.801 --> 00:04:36.634
<v Speaker 2>in the infinite.</v>

128
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.110
<v Speaker 2>And I actually think that that's,</v>

129
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.240
<v Speaker 2>that's empirically true.</v>

130
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.160
<v Speaker 2>Like we are these weird creatures that are both finite and infinite at the same</v>

131
00:04:45.161 --> 00:04:45.551
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

132
00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:47.320
<v Speaker 2>And we have experiences of that,</v>

133
00:04:47.321 --> 00:04:49.630
<v Speaker 2>even like deep religious experiences,</v>

134
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.910
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic experiences for that matter.</v>

135
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.193
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

136
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.340
<v Speaker 2>invoke that feeling of that invoke the reality,</v>

137
00:04:57.341 --> 00:04:57.911
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

138
00:04:57.911 --> 00:04:59.800
<v Speaker 2>of our connection with the infinite.</v>

139
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.380
<v Speaker 2>Now what that infinite is,</v>

140
00:05:02.381 --> 00:05:04.090
<v Speaker 2>so let's call that God.</v>

141
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean the Christian ideas that that's actually outside of time and space</v>

142
00:05:07.601 --> 00:05:08.171
<v Speaker 2>itself,</v>

143
00:05:08.171 --> 00:05:09.170
<v Speaker 2>which is quite a grant,</v>

144
00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.970
<v Speaker 2>no ship,</v>

145
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.320
<v Speaker 2>and not the least bit</v>

146
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.380
<v Speaker 2>unsophisticated by the way.</v>

147
00:05:14.381 --> 00:05:18.880
<v Speaker 2>It's a tremendously sophisticated idea that something actually exists outside</v>

148
00:05:18.881 --> 00:05:21.310
<v Speaker 2>the fabric of time and space that transcends it,</v>

149
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.460
<v Speaker 2>that they are at the beginning and at the end.</v>

150
00:05:24.461 --> 00:05:28.780
<v Speaker 2>That's an unbelievably sophisticated idea and I think that people can experience</v>

151
00:05:28.781 --> 00:05:30.190
<v Speaker 2>that and do quite commonly,</v>

152
00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.990
<v Speaker 2>which was why the psychedelic revolution in the 60s was so absolutely potent.</v>

153
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.600
<v Speaker 2>So these sorts of things can't just be dismissed with some rationalist sleight</v>

154
00:05:40.601 --> 00:05:41.434
<v Speaker 2>of hand and,</v>

155
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.910
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

156
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:45.670
<v Speaker 2>and some discussion of the idea that Christianity Judeo Christianity,</v>

157
00:05:45.671 --> 00:05:50.530
<v Speaker 2>let's say as some like primitive set of wish fulfillment superstitions or some</v>

158
00:05:50.531 --> 00:05:51.251
<v Speaker 2>power game.</v>

159
00:05:51.251 --> 00:05:55.390
<v Speaker 2>It's like you just have no depth of scholarship whatsoever.</v>

160
00:05:55.391 --> 00:05:56.950
<v Speaker 2>If that's what your criticisms are.</v>

161
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.110
<v Speaker 1>I would say when,</v>

162
00:06:00.111 --> 00:06:00.501
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

163
00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:00.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

164
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.430
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

165
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:02.150
<v Speaker 1>your ass,</v>

166
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:03.140
<v Speaker 1>when you ask someone,</v>

167
00:06:03.141 --> 00:06:04.310
<v Speaker 1>do you believe in God?</v>

168
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.233
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

169
00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.230
<v Speaker 1>I ask myself if I say that I don't believe in God</v>

170
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.110
<v Speaker 1>within me.</v>

171
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.450
<v Speaker 1>When I say eh,</v>

172
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.690
<v Speaker 1>what is different within me when I say that I don't believe in God compared to a</v>

173
00:06:17.691 --> 00:06:19.880
<v Speaker 1>person that says that he does believe in God.</v>

174
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean is if I feel sort of a irrational,</v>

175
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:29.140
<v Speaker 1>I wake up or I take a glass of wine and then suddenly I'm overwhelmed with love</v>

176
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.360
<v Speaker 1>for human kind or for my fellow man or something like that.</v>

177
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.831
<v Speaker 1>So if I,</v>

178
00:06:33.831 --> 00:06:36.680
<v Speaker 1>if I was a person who will say that I believed in God,</v>

179
00:06:36.681 --> 00:06:39.140
<v Speaker 1>would that be something?</v>

180
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:43.220
<v Speaker 1>Is it something qualitatively different between the person,</v>

181
00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.460
<v Speaker 1>between me compared to that person?</v>

182
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.020
<v Speaker 1>You understand what I'm saying?</v>

183
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:49.790
<v Speaker 1>I haven't quite got that yet.</v>
