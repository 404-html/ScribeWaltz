1
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.260
<v Speaker 1>Then she has,</v>

2
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.180
<v Speaker 1>she gets pregnant and she has twins.</v>

3
00:00:11.181 --> 00:00:13.190
<v Speaker 1>And this is an interesting thing.</v>

4
00:00:13.191 --> 00:00:14.900
<v Speaker 1>The twins fight inside her.</v>

5
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.750
<v Speaker 1>She can tell that they're not getting along.</v>

6
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.220
<v Speaker 1>And this is an echo,</v>

7
00:00:19.221 --> 00:00:19.521
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

8
00:00:19.521 --> 00:00:24.521
<v Speaker 1>It's an echo of Cain and Abel and there's a mythological motif that the unions</v>

9
00:00:24.651 --> 00:00:26.180
<v Speaker 1>have called the hostile brothers,</v>

10
00:00:26.181 --> 00:00:27.170
<v Speaker 1>the hostile brothers.</v>

11
00:00:27.171 --> 00:00:28.460
<v Speaker 1>And you see them all the time.</v>

12
00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:32.510
<v Speaker 1>Batman and the joker are hostile brothers and Thor and Loki or hostile brothers</v>

13
00:00:32.511 --> 00:00:33.100
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

14
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.470
<v Speaker 1>it's an unbelievably common motif and uh,</v>

15
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:37.071
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:37.071 --> 00:00:39.380
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate hostile brothers or Christ and Satan.</v>

17
00:00:39.381 --> 00:00:40.214
<v Speaker 1>So that's the,</v>

18
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.670
<v Speaker 1>that's the archetipal representation of the hostile brothers,</v>

19
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.361
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

20
00:00:44.361 --> 00:00:45.980
<v Speaker 1>The ultimate good and the ultimate evil.</v>

21
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:47.323
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

22
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.910
<v Speaker 1>and so it's an echo of the Cain and Abel story,</v>

23
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.790
<v Speaker 1>although it's a little more complex,</v>

24
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.290
<v Speaker 1>I would say from a literary point of view because it isn't obvious which of</v>

25
00:00:57.291 --> 00:00:57.981
<v Speaker 1>these brothers,</v>

26
00:00:57.981 --> 00:00:59.570
<v Speaker 1>his cane and which of them is able,</v>

27
00:00:59.571 --> 00:01:02.360
<v Speaker 1>they have parts of both in each of them.</v>

28
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:03.640
<v Speaker 1>So Esau,</v>

29
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.160
<v Speaker 1>who turns out to be one of the brothers and Jacob move turns out to be the</v>

30
00:01:07.161 --> 00:01:07.700
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

31
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.300
<v Speaker 1>both have their admiral bull qualities and their faults.</v>

32
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:12.201
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

33
00:01:12.201 --> 00:01:15.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm Esau comes is born first,</v>

34
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.570
<v Speaker 1>but Jacob hasn't by the heel.</v>

35
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.880
<v Speaker 1>And so there was a fight within the womb to see who would emerge first.</v>

36
00:01:22.881 --> 00:01:27.881
<v Speaker 1>Now that's relevant because the firstborn had a special status,</v>

37
00:01:28.071 --> 00:01:30.020
<v Speaker 1>while has a special status in many communities,</v>

38
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.970
<v Speaker 1>especially agricultural communities.</v>

39
00:01:31.971 --> 00:01:35.360
<v Speaker 1>And there's a reason all these people were more hurts people.</v>

40
00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:38.540
<v Speaker 1>But if you divide your property equally among all your children,</v>

41
00:01:38.541 --> 00:01:39.740
<v Speaker 1>then he'd like three generations.</v>

42
00:01:39.741 --> 00:01:42.440
<v Speaker 1>Everybody has one goat and everybody starves to death,</v>

43
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:43.131
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

44
00:01:43.131 --> 00:01:44.970
<v Speaker 1>Or the same thing happens with lands.</v>

45
00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:49.100
<v Speaker 1>So one of the ways that that traditional communities solve that as they just</v>

46
00:01:49.101 --> 00:01:53.330
<v Speaker 1>give them almost everything to the first born and then the everyone else knows,</v>

47
00:01:53.331 --> 00:01:53.571
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

48
00:01:53.571 --> 00:01:56.600
<v Speaker 1>you go out and do whatever you can and it's kind of arbitrary and unfair,</v>

49
00:01:56.601 --> 00:01:57.620
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

50
00:01:57.621 --> 00:02:02.621
<v Speaker 1>at least it's predictably arbitrary and unfair instead of doom over four</v>

51
00:02:02.721 --> 00:02:03.501
<v Speaker 1>generations,</v>

52
00:02:03.501 --> 00:02:04.100
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

53
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.730
<v Speaker 1>So it actually mattered to be the first born and God generally favors the first</v>

54
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:09.573
<v Speaker 1>born.</v>

55
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.850
<v Speaker 1>And then you might think,</v>

56
00:02:10.851 --> 00:02:10.971
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

57
00:02:10.971 --> 00:02:12.580
<v Speaker 1>what is it about being born first?</v>

58
00:02:12.581 --> 00:02:13.460
<v Speaker 1>It's so relevant,</v>

59
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

60
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.860
<v Speaker 1>apart from the,</v>

61
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.260
<v Speaker 1>the cultural practice of,</v>

62
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.200
<v Speaker 1>of a board.</v>

63
00:02:18.201 --> 00:02:19.130
<v Speaker 1>Generous inheritance.</v>

64
00:02:19.131 --> 00:02:19.911
<v Speaker 1>And I would say,</v>

65
00:02:19.911 --> 00:02:20.061
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

66
00:02:20.061 --> 00:02:23.360
<v Speaker 1>the first born is something like the model for the leader of the family,</v>

67
00:02:23.361 --> 00:02:23.541
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

68
00:02:23.541 --> 00:02:25.940
<v Speaker 1>Because the first born child should be,</v>

69
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.260
<v Speaker 1>if there's a number of siblings,</v>

70
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.860
<v Speaker 1>a should take care of the siblings at least to some degree,</v>

71
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.780
<v Speaker 1>but also should be a role model for them.</v>

72
00:02:32.781 --> 00:02:35.030
<v Speaker 1>So it's like a natural position of leadership,</v>

73
00:02:35.031 --> 00:02:36.590
<v Speaker 1>but there's a cycle.</v>

74
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.610
<v Speaker 1>There's a cycle psychologize of the idea of the firstborn in these stories</v>

75
00:02:40.611 --> 00:02:45.611
<v Speaker 1>because God often passes over the first born in favor of a later born child.</v>

76
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

77
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.910
<v Speaker 1>he seems to do that on the basis of moral character,</v>

78
00:02:49.911 --> 00:02:50.744
<v Speaker 1>essentially.</v>

79
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.160
<v Speaker 1>And so there's this idea that,</v>

80
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.720
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

81
00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.330
<v Speaker 1>there's a natural proclivity towards leadership.</v>

82
00:02:56.331 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>That's just a biological fact that would be associated being a first born.</v>

83
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.960
<v Speaker 1>But there's an element of character,</v>

84
00:03:01.961 --> 00:03:04.300
<v Speaker 1>a logical development that transcends that.</v>

85
00:03:04.301 --> 00:03:05.490
<v Speaker 1>And so that you,</v>

86
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.140
<v Speaker 1>it's more important to be spiritually a firstborn,</v>

87
00:03:08.141 --> 00:03:08.501
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

88
00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:10.390
<v Speaker 1>than to be biologically a first born.</v>

89
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.400
<v Speaker 1>And God recognizes that continually in these stories and inverts the natural</v>

90
00:03:15.731 --> 00:03:17.950
<v Speaker 1>order and favors a later board who's,</v>

91
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.060
<v Speaker 1>who's done more work with regards to characterological development.</v>
