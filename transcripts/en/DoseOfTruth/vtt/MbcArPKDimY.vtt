1
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.080
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of times soldiers develop post</v>

2
00:00:09.081 --> 00:00:11.540
<v Speaker 1>traumatic stress disorder because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>go out in the battlefield,</v>

3
00:00:11.541 --> 00:00:13.310
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of naive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're young guys,</v>

4
00:00:13.311 --> 00:00:14.144
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

5
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:14.841
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

6
00:00:14.841 --> 00:00:17.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it actually is worse if they're not that</v>

7
00:00:17.871 --> 00:00:20.270
<v Speaker 1>bright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turns out because having a lower Iq</v>

8
00:00:20.271 --> 00:00:23.180
<v Speaker 1>is one of the things that predisposes</v>
<v Speaker 1>you to post traumatic stress disorder.</v>

9
00:00:23.181 --> 00:00:25.340
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go out in the battlefield and they</v>

10
00:00:25.341 --> 00:00:28.310
<v Speaker 1>see what they're capable of under</v>
<v Speaker 1>battlefield conditions.</v>

11
00:00:28.311 --> 00:00:29.420
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.270
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been fighting wars for a very long</v>

13
00:00:32.271 --> 00:00:34.130
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of years.</v>

14
00:00:34.131 --> 00:00:36.770
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chimps basically have wars with other</v>

15
00:00:36.771 --> 00:00:38.330
<v Speaker 1>chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the troops,</v>

16
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.060
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause the juveniles will patrol the</v>

17
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.020
<v Speaker 1>perimeter perimeter of their territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if they find other chimps from other</v>

18
00:00:45.021 --> 00:00:49.370
<v Speaker 1>troops that they outnumber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will tear them to pieces like in</v>

19
00:00:49.371 --> 00:00:50.990
<v Speaker 1>chimps are really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really strong.</v>

20
00:00:50.991 --> 00:00:53.210
<v Speaker 1>And so when I say they'll tear them to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces,</v>

21
00:00:53.211 --> 00:00:54.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean that literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:00:54.561 --> 00:00:56.570
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tear them to pieces.</v>

23
00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.040
<v Speaker 1>And Jane Goodall discovered that</v>
<v Speaker 1>originally in 1970s she didn't even</v>

24
00:01:01.041 --> 00:01:03.920
<v Speaker 1>report it for a while because she was so</v>
<v Speaker 1>shocked.</v>

25
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.770
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she kind of assumed like most followers</v>

26
00:01:06.771 --> 00:01:11.680
<v Speaker 1>of roots so that the human proclivity</v>
<v Speaker 1>for warfare was part,</v>

27
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.210
<v Speaker 1>that part that was something that was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>uniquely human.</v>

28
00:01:14.211 --> 00:01:15.710
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it had something to do with our,</v>

29
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.820
<v Speaker 1>our unique self consciousness or our</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence or something like that.</v>

30
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.930
<v Speaker 1>She had no idea that it was rooted that</v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply.</v>

31
00:01:23.931 --> 00:01:26.240
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we split from chimps about six,</v>

32
00:01:26.241 --> 00:01:28.190
<v Speaker 1>7 million years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

33
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.220
<v Speaker 1>And so we were patrolling territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were gang members 7 million years</v>

34
00:01:34.641 --> 00:01:36.260
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

35
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.800
<v Speaker 1>it that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's minimum estimation because of</v>

36
00:01:39.801 --> 00:01:44.801
<v Speaker 1>course that ancestor shaded back maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 million years into entities that were</v>

37
00:01:48.591 --> 00:01:53.020
<v Speaker 1>roughly primate like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so territoriality and a,</v>

38
00:01:53.021 --> 00:01:56.540
<v Speaker 1>and a proclivity to defend territory is</v>
<v Speaker 1>so deeply embedded in us.</v>

39
00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:57.910
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

40
00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:58.783
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

41
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.200
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's the control center for</v>
<v Speaker 1>our whole brain.</v>

42
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.020
<v Speaker 1>And so there isn't anything more</v>
<v Speaker 1>important to us,</v>

43
00:02:06.021 --> 00:02:11.021
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then maintaining the match between what</v>

44
00:02:12.531 --> 00:02:16.340
<v Speaker 1>we want to have happen and what other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are doing in response to our</v>

45
00:02:16.341 --> 00:02:18.740
<v Speaker 1>actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's that that's what we want.</v>

46
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.160
<v Speaker 1>And as long as that match is maintained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then our emotional systems,</v>

47
00:02:24.771 --> 00:02:28.010
<v Speaker 1>and I would say anxiety's probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>primary in that regard.</v>

48
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.250
<v Speaker 1>Our emotional systems remain inhibited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're on,</v>

49
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.320
<v Speaker 1>they're ready,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

50
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.220
<v Speaker 1>like a nuclear reactor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rods are on and the rest of the brain</v>

51
00:02:40.221 --> 00:02:42.780
<v Speaker 1>dampens them down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's like it,</v>

52
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.630
<v Speaker 1>you don't want them to take time to</v>
<v Speaker 1>start it up,</v>

53
00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:46.820
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want them to be on at a,</v>

54
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.760
<v Speaker 1>at a 10th of a second's notice when it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary.</v>

55
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.571
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

56
00:02:50.571 --> 00:02:52.850
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well if you look like look at a wild</v>

57
00:02:52.851 --> 00:02:54.800
<v Speaker 1>animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's alert,</v>

58
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.400
<v Speaker 1>it's ready to dark this way or that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially a prey animal</v>

59
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>instantaneously.</v>

60
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.060
<v Speaker 1>And it has reflexes built into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you do that,</v>

61
00:03:04.061 --> 00:03:07.570
<v Speaker 1>we'll respond way before your conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

62
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.080
<v Speaker 1>if you happen to be walking down a trail</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you detect something snake,</v>

63
00:03:12.081 --> 00:03:16.180
<v Speaker 1>like in the periphery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll leap away before you even know</v>

64
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.020
<v Speaker 1>that you lapped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

65
00:03:18.021 --> 00:03:21.730
<v Speaker 1>but that's because it takes a fair bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>of time to actually see a snake.</v>

66
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.840
<v Speaker 1>By which I mean form a conscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of the snake,</v>

67
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.970
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it takes a quarter of a second</v>

68
00:03:27.971 --> 00:03:30.220
<v Speaker 1>or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even longer,</v>

69
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.440
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it takes,</v>

70
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20th of a second,</v>

71
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.960
<v Speaker 1>a 10th of a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing about the damn snake is</v>

72
00:03:37.961 --> 00:03:40.480
<v Speaker 1>it's way faster than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really fast.</v>

73
00:03:40.481 --> 00:03:43.210
<v Speaker 1>That thing and it coevolved with</v>
<v Speaker 1>primates by the way.</v>

74
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.470
<v Speaker 1>And so it can nail you like way faster</v>
<v Speaker 1>than you can look at it.</v>

75
00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:52.471
<v Speaker 1>So you have your eyes map snake like</v>
<v Speaker 1>objects right onto your reflexes so that</v>

76
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.560
<v Speaker 1>the eyes go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the eyes make you jump,</v>

77
00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.470
<v Speaker 1>and then they see after that it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

78
00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:01.990
<v Speaker 1>well now you can see that's no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

79
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.500
<v Speaker 1>so all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

80
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.570
<v Speaker 1>Now what I would say that what we do is</v>
<v Speaker 1>we live in a shared story and the story</v>

81
00:04:12.881 --> 00:04:16.030
<v Speaker 1>is a way of looking at the world and its</v>
<v Speaker 1>way of acting in the world at the same</v>

82
00:04:16.031 --> 00:04:18.610
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that story has to operate within</v>

83
00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.070
<v Speaker 1>narrow parameters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is something that's</v>

84
00:04:21.071 --> 00:04:23.920
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily important to understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

85
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.470
<v Speaker 1>and this is something I think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Piaget figured out,</v>

86
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.720
<v Speaker 1>John Piaget figured out better than</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone else.</v>

87
00:04:28.721 --> 00:04:30.880
<v Speaker 1>I think he really got this right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

88
00:04:30.881 --> 00:04:32.980
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that Piaget was trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do,</v>

89
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.220
<v Speaker 1>you never hear about how strange these</v>
<v Speaker 1>great thinkers are.</v>

90
00:04:36.221 --> 00:04:38.950
<v Speaker 1>But Piaget was a very strange guy and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a,</v>

91
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.600
<v Speaker 1>he was a hyper genius and he was offered</v>
<v Speaker 1>the curatorship of a bloody museum when</v>

92
00:04:43.601 --> 00:04:45.340
<v Speaker 1>he was 10 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

93
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.800
<v Speaker 1>cause he wrote this little paper on</v>
<v Speaker 1>molluscs which parent?</v>

94
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.740
<v Speaker 1>It was a very good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they offered him the curatorship of a</v>

95
00:04:50.741 --> 00:04:53.080
<v Speaker 1>museum and his parents wrote back and</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

96
00:04:53.081 --> 00:04:55.060
<v Speaker 1>well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

97
00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:58.990
<v Speaker 1>probably not because he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's actually 10 and so that was Piaget</v>

98
00:04:58.991 --> 00:05:00.370
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy was a genius.</v>

99
00:05:00.371 --> 00:05:01.480
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

100
00:05:01.481 --> 00:05:06.130
<v Speaker 1>he was actually motivated by the desire</v>
<v Speaker 1>to reconcile science and religion.</v>

101
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.820
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was actually his entire motivation</v>

102
00:05:09.821 --> 00:05:11.380
<v Speaker 1>for what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never hear that.</v>

103
00:05:11.381 --> 00:05:12.790
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the case.</v>

104
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.480
<v Speaker 1>And so Piaget was very interested in how</v>
<v Speaker 1>you produce structures that enable you</v>

105
00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:21.710
<v Speaker 1>to regulate yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you're like a kind of a,</v>

106
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.320
<v Speaker 1>a colony of strange sub animals that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to figure out how to get along so</v>

107
00:05:26.321 --> 00:05:29.230
<v Speaker 1>that you can sort of be one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You kind of learn that,</v>

108
00:05:29.231 --> 00:05:33.100
<v Speaker 1>I would say between the ages of two and</v>
<v Speaker 1>four as you're being socialized,</v>

109
00:05:33.101 --> 00:05:34.990
<v Speaker 1>you know how erratic two year olds are.</v>

110
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're a blast.</v>

111
00:05:36.041 --> 00:05:37.540
<v Speaker 1>And it's partly because they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>erratic.</v>

112
00:05:37.541 --> 00:05:41.290
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're unbelievably happy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they're unbelievably hungry and</v>

113
00:05:41.291 --> 00:05:44.350
<v Speaker 1>then they're really hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they're really upset and</v>

114
00:05:44.351 --> 00:05:45.131
<v Speaker 1>crying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

115
00:05:45.131 --> 00:05:46.660
<v Speaker 1>And then they're really scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

116
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.740
<v Speaker 1>and all of that's just untrammeled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's really fun to be around</v>

117
00:05:50.741 --> 00:05:52.120
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when they're happy because</v>

118
00:05:52.121 --> 00:05:54.370
<v Speaker 1>they're so happy that it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

119
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.700
<v Speaker 1>you don't ever get to be that happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's nice to be around a two year</v>

120
00:05:58.701 --> 00:06:02.450
<v Speaker 1>old because you can kinda feel that</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

121
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.680
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of what the,</v>

122
00:06:03.681 --> 00:06:07.400
<v Speaker 1>one of the horrible things about being a</v>
<v Speaker 1>parent is that you spend a tremendous</v>

123
00:06:07.401 --> 00:06:10.850
<v Speaker 1>amount of your time making your child</v>
<v Speaker 1>less happy.</v>

124
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:15.380
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that positive</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion is a very impulsive,</v>

125
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:16.611
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

126
00:06:16.611 --> 00:06:18.350
<v Speaker 1>cause everybody says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you should be happy.</v>

127
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:19.850
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>

128
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.310
<v Speaker 1>when you're happy you're actually quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid.</v>

129
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.100
<v Speaker 1>And so because happiness makes you</v>
<v Speaker 1>impulsive,</v>

130
00:06:25.101 --> 00:06:27.020
<v Speaker 1>happiness makes happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

131
00:06:27.021 --> 00:06:28.490
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are really good right now.</v>

132
00:06:28.491 --> 00:06:30.680
<v Speaker 1>Get Wet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can while the getting's good.</v>

133
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:35.660
<v Speaker 1>And so as a like if you're a hyper</v>
<v Speaker 1>optimistic manic,</v>

134
00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:38.930
<v Speaker 1>we'll say it's like every stock</v>
<v Speaker 1>investment looks like a really good</v>

135
00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:41.630
<v Speaker 1>stock investment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you won't spend all your money</v>

136
00:06:41.631 --> 00:06:43.760
<v Speaker 1>because look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's those wonderful things</v>

137
00:06:43.761 --> 00:06:45.950
<v Speaker 1>everywhere and you could do such great</v>
<v Speaker 1>things with them.</v>

138
00:06:45.951 --> 00:06:46.820
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

139
00:06:46.821 --> 00:06:50.810
<v Speaker 1>you spend all your money and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>crash and you think,</v>

140
00:06:50.811 --> 00:06:52.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my life's over.</v>

141
00:06:52.311 --> 00:06:53.210
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I just,</v>

142
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.750
<v Speaker 1>I just spent all my money on all this</v>
<v Speaker 1>useless stuff.</v>

143
00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.390
<v Speaker 1>And it's all under the grip of</v>
<v Speaker 1>impulsive,</v>

144
00:06:59.391 --> 00:07:01.220
<v Speaker 1>positive emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

145
00:07:01.221 --> 00:07:04.490
<v Speaker 1>And so when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're telling your kids to be</v>

146
00:07:04.491 --> 00:07:08.330
<v Speaker 1>quiet and settled down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't because they're making a lot of</v>

147
00:07:08.331 --> 00:07:08.690
<v Speaker 1>noise.</v>

148
00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:13.690
<v Speaker 1>Being in pain is because they're running</v>
<v Speaker 1>around like wild baboons having a blast.</v>

149
00:07:13.761 --> 00:07:16.220
<v Speaker 1>And disrupting things like mad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

150
00:07:16.221 --> 00:07:16.880
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

151
00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.620
<v Speaker 1>you got kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to settle down,</v>

152
00:07:18.621 --> 00:07:21.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like quit having so much fun.</v>

153
00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.440
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of awful that you do that,</v>

154
00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:26.510
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you do.</v>

155
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:32.140
<v Speaker 1>And that's because the emotions and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivations have to be brought into like</v>

156
00:07:32.481 --> 00:07:35.270
<v Speaker 1>a relationship with one another within</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person.</v>

157
00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:36.980
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

158
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.170
<v Speaker 1>one thing I remember with my son who is</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite,</v>

159
00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:43.160
<v Speaker 1>he's quite disagreeable by temperament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is actually a good thing as far as</v>

160
00:07:43.161 --> 00:07:45.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it brings its own challenges.</v>

161
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.040
<v Speaker 1>And so with my daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when she was misbehaving,</v>

162
00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:54.340
<v Speaker 1>she was pretty agreeable and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

163
00:07:54.741 --> 00:07:57.620
<v Speaker 1>if she was misbehaving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can basically just look at her and</v>

164
00:07:57.621 --> 00:07:58.730
<v Speaker 1>then she'd quit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

165
00:07:58.731 --> 00:07:59.900
<v Speaker 1>but my son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

166
00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:01.880
<v Speaker 1>that was just nothing.</v>

167
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:02.930
<v Speaker 1>You're looking at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

168
00:08:02.931 --> 00:08:04.610
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just not going to go anywhere,</v>

169
00:08:04.611 --> 00:08:07.280
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then I'd like tell him to stop.</v>

170
00:08:07.281 --> 00:08:09.830
<v Speaker 1>And that really wasn't having much of an</v>
<v Speaker 1>effect either.</v>

171
00:08:09.831 --> 00:08:12.710
<v Speaker 1>He just sort of maybe laugh or run away</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever.</v>

172
00:08:12.711 --> 00:08:14.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a tough little rat.</v>

173
00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:18.890
<v Speaker 1>And you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would do with him is he would be doing</v>

174
00:08:18.891 --> 00:08:21.870
<v Speaker 1>something and identity or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he'd get upset and you know,</v>

175
00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:24.410
<v Speaker 1>angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then I get them to sit on the</v>

176
00:08:24.411 --> 00:08:27.170
<v Speaker 1>steps and I had told him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is when he was about to,</v>

177
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:28.131
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

178
00:08:28.131 --> 00:08:29.990
<v Speaker 1>you're going to sit on the steps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's time out.</v>

179
00:08:29.991 --> 00:08:34.580
<v Speaker 1>You're going to sit on the steps until</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got control of yourself and you</v>

180
00:08:34.581 --> 00:08:38.060
<v Speaker 1>can come back and be and play the family</v>
<v Speaker 1>game again.</v>

181
00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.450
<v Speaker 1>I basically said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a civilized human being and then</v>

182
00:08:41.451 --> 00:08:42.380
<v Speaker 1>you're welcome again.</v>

183
00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:45.500
<v Speaker 1>And so he'd sit on the steps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so interesting to watch because</v>

184
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:48.980
<v Speaker 1>he was just enraged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd sit there like if you ever seen a</v>

185
00:08:48.981 --> 00:08:52.520
<v Speaker 1>two year old have a temper Tantrum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really quite the bloody phenomena.</v>

186
00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:54.950
<v Speaker 1>If you ever saw an adult do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd like,</v>

187
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:56.970
<v Speaker 1>you'd call nine one one right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

188
00:08:56.971 --> 00:08:59.400
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've seen adults do that.</v>

189
00:08:59.401 --> 00:09:01.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because people say with borderline</v>

190
00:09:01.561 --> 00:09:04.290
<v Speaker 1>personality disorder will have temper</v>
<v Speaker 1>tantrums and it's like,</v>

191
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.990
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to be about 30 feet away from</v>

192
00:09:06.991 --> 00:09:08.310
<v Speaker 1>that person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>

193
00:09:08.311 --> 00:09:10.860
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in kids it's like,</v>

194
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.020
<v Speaker 1>well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're only this long,</v>

195
00:09:13.021 --> 00:09:14.880
<v Speaker 1>so how much trouble can they really</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause?</v>

196
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:15.930
<v Speaker 1>But it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

197
00:09:15.931 --> 00:09:20.250
<v Speaker 1>they're just completely gone there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like on the floor or their face is red.</v>

198
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:24.210
<v Speaker 1>They're just furious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like way more furious than you ever get</v>

199
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.500
<v Speaker 1>if you're even vaguely socialized there.</v>

200
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:30.300
<v Speaker 1>Just outraged and they're kicking and</v>
<v Speaker 1>hitting the ground and like,</v>

201
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:33.180
<v Speaker 1>it's like a little epileptic fit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>anger.</v>

202
00:09:33.181 --> 00:09:35.340
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're completely controlled by their</v>

203
00:09:35.341 --> 00:09:38.130
<v Speaker 1>rage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we took care of one kid for a while</v>

204
00:09:38.131 --> 00:09:40.700
<v Speaker 1>who he was actually a pushover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kid,</v>

205
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:42.950
<v Speaker 1>you could get them to behave by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

206
00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.600
<v Speaker 1>kind of shaking your finger at him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But his mother thought he was really</v>

207
00:09:45.601 --> 00:09:49.050
<v Speaker 1>tough because he had her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had her figured out and one of the</v>

208
00:09:49.051 --> 00:09:51.060
<v Speaker 1>things he would do is have a territory</v>
<v Speaker 1>temper tantrum.</v>

209
00:09:51.061 --> 00:09:55.110
<v Speaker 1>And during the temper tantrum he would</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold his bloody breath until he turned</v>

210
00:09:55.111 --> 00:09:56.490
<v Speaker 1>blue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

211
00:09:56.491 --> 00:09:57.570
<v Speaker 1>try that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

212
00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as that's your homework,</v>

213
00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:02.490
<v Speaker 1>go home and go home and have a temper</v>
<v Speaker 1>tantrum and while you're doing it,</v>

214
00:10:02.491 --> 00:10:05.310
<v Speaker 1>hold your breath until you actually turn</v>
<v Speaker 1>blue.</v>

215
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:06.750
<v Speaker 1>It's like you won't be able to do it.</v>

216
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:09.260
<v Speaker 1>You don't have the willpower of a two</v>
<v Speaker 1>year old now.</v>

217
00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:11.190
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That little varmint man,</v>

218
00:10:11.191 --> 00:10:13.710
<v Speaker 1>he just have a fit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he'd hold his breath and then he'd</v>

219
00:10:13.711 --> 00:10:14.850
<v Speaker 1>turn blue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

220
00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:15.743
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

221
00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:17.750
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we would just like,</v>

222
00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.450
<v Speaker 1>let him do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

223
00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:23.010
<v Speaker 1>he turned blue and everybody would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>gone and he'd come out of it,</v>

224
00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:25.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it didn't work.</v>

225
00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:29.040
<v Speaker 1>So he just quit doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he did it like twice and he</v>

226
00:10:29.041 --> 00:10:31.590
<v Speaker 1>figured out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh well that's a lot of work for very</v>

227
00:10:31.591 --> 00:10:32.940
<v Speaker 1>little outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

228
00:10:32.941 --> 00:10:34.870
<v Speaker 1>it's not like two year olds are stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

229
00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.950
<v Speaker 1>they're not stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're probably smarter than you,</v>

230
00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:41.190
<v Speaker 1>but they're not civilized by any stretch</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the imagination.</v>

231
00:10:41.191 --> 00:10:42.690
<v Speaker 1>And so anyways,</v>
