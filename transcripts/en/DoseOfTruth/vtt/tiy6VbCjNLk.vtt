1
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.380
<v Speaker 1>Well those are two very different called questions.</v>

3
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.680
<v Speaker 1>How can you help your parents to sort themselves out?</v>

4
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.240
<v Speaker 1>I guess the first question would be,</v>

6
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.823
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

7
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.120
<v Speaker 1>or do they want to sort themselves out because it's not that easy to help people</v>

8
00:00:22.491 --> 00:00:23.870
<v Speaker 1>if they don't want to be helped.</v>

9
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.073
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

10
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.810
<v Speaker 1>if they do want to be helped.</v>

11
00:00:26.811 --> 00:00:30.020
<v Speaker 1>Like listening is really a good strategy.</v>

12
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.493
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

13
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:32.663
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

14
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.863
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

15
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.180
<v Speaker 1>you got the question right?</v>

16
00:00:35.181 --> 00:00:35.721
<v Speaker 1>Because you said,</v>

17
00:00:35.721 --> 00:00:38.570
<v Speaker 1>how can I help my parents to sort themselves out,</v>

18
00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:41.240
<v Speaker 1>which is very different than how can I sort my parents out?</v>

19
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:42.620
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

20
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.700
<v Speaker 2>you help people</v>

21
00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.410
<v Speaker 1>to sort themselves out once they have decided to do so by giving them the</v>

22
00:00:49.691 --> 00:00:54.691
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to talk about their concerns and also to outline what potential</v>

23
00:00:54.761 --> 00:00:59.761
<v Speaker 1>solutions might be and you don't want to offer any pieces of advice while you're</v>

24
00:01:00.341 --> 00:01:05.341
<v Speaker 1>doing that because it turns out that people are much more likely to implement a</v>

25
00:01:05.561 --> 00:01:08.770
<v Speaker 1>strategy of improvement if they generate it themselves.</v>

26
00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.650
<v Speaker 1>And then also you don't steal the accomplishment from them.</v>

27
00:01:11.651 --> 00:01:11.831
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

28
00:01:11.831 --> 00:01:14.650
<v Speaker 1>let's say you came to me with a bunch of problems and I said,</v>

29
00:01:14.651 --> 00:01:15.160
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

30
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.870
<v Speaker 1>here's what you can do about that.</v>

31
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.370
<v Speaker 1>And then you went out and did it and it worked.</v>

32
00:01:21.371 --> 00:01:23.860
<v Speaker 1>And then then in some sense that's not your accomplishment.</v>

33
00:01:23.861 --> 00:01:25.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean it is in so far as you implemented,</v>

34
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.860
<v Speaker 1>but it's not in so far as it was something that I planned.</v>

35
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.330
<v Speaker 1>And you're intimation of that your intimation of the fact that the</v>

36
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.830
<v Speaker 1>delight in success in the responsibility for six success might've been stolen</v>

37
00:01:41.321 --> 00:01:46.321
<v Speaker 1>from you by well meaning advice is going to interfere with the probability that</v>

38
00:01:46.751 --> 00:01:48.190
<v Speaker 1>you'll implement the solution.</v>

39
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.230
<v Speaker 1>And so it's best to let people talk through their own problems.</v>

40
00:01:53.231 --> 00:01:53.680
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

41
00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.801
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

42
00:01:53.801 --> 00:01:54.790
<v Speaker 1>what's the problem?</v>

43
00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:56.500
<v Speaker 1>That's what you ask.</v>

44
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.131
<v Speaker 1>What's the problem?</v>

45
00:01:57.131 --> 00:01:58.960
<v Speaker 1>What do you think's not write about your life?</v>

46
00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.320
<v Speaker 1>And then people will throw in a bunch of things that they're complaining about</v>

47
00:02:02.321 --> 00:02:03.430
<v Speaker 1>or resentful about and,</v>

48
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.030
<v Speaker 1>and it might be quite an extensive list and they'll feel guilty about it because</v>

49
00:02:07.031 --> 00:02:08.430
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to burden you with it,</v>

50
00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.720
<v Speaker 1>but they need to get it all off their chest.</v>

51
00:02:10.721 --> 00:02:10.871
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

52
00:02:10.871 --> 00:02:12.460
<v Speaker 1>They need to get the cards on the table.</v>

53
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.670
<v Speaker 1>It's also something to know when you're talking to your wife for your husband or</v>

54
00:02:15.671 --> 00:02:18.190
<v Speaker 1>your intimate partner or a child for that matter,</v>

55
00:02:18.191 --> 00:02:20.020
<v Speaker 1>so when you have a close relationship with this,</v>

56
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.270
<v Speaker 1>if they've got some things to complain about,</v>

57
00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.740
<v Speaker 1>which they undoubtedly do,</v>

58
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.270
<v Speaker 1>they're going to complain about a lot more things than they're actually upset</v>

59
00:02:28.271 --> 00:02:33.271
<v Speaker 1>about because they'll have gathered up irritations that have been unspoken and</v>

60
00:02:33.791 --> 00:02:38.791
<v Speaker 1>aggravations and fears and they'll all be upsetting them emotionally and they</v>

61
00:02:39.881 --> 00:02:42.850
<v Speaker 1>don't know exactly what they are until they articulate that,</v>

62
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.461
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

63
00:02:43.461 --> 00:02:43.781
<v Speaker 1>we say,</v>

64
00:02:43.781 --> 00:02:44.111
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

65
00:02:44.111 --> 00:02:45.190
<v Speaker 1>what are you upset about?</v>

66
00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.521
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

67
00:02:45.521 --> 00:02:46.354
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

68
00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.541
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

69
00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:47.800
<v Speaker 1>how can you not know?</v>

70
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.371
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

71
00:02:48.371 --> 00:02:51.790
<v Speaker 1>the answer is there's all sorts of things that you respond to emotionally before</v>

72
00:02:51.791 --> 00:02:52.930
<v Speaker 1>you can articulate them.</v>

73
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.740
<v Speaker 1>Then you get upset and you explode and you yell and you lay out all the things</v>

74
00:02:56.741 --> 00:03:01.250
<v Speaker 1>you might be angry about and you're impulsive and you your case and you accuse</v>

75
00:03:01.251 --> 00:03:04.240
<v Speaker 1>people of things that you don't even believe all of.</v>

76
00:03:04.241 --> 00:03:07.450
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the process of laying your cards out on the table.</v>

77
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.220
<v Speaker 1>You have complex situations that are disturbing you and you don't know what they</v>

78
00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:12.491
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

79
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:13.121
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

80
00:03:13.121 --> 00:03:14.260
<v Speaker 1>You have to kind of guess.</v>

81
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.891
<v Speaker 1>So you say,</v>

82
00:03:14.891 --> 00:03:15.011
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

83
00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:16.240
<v Speaker 1>it might be this and it might be that,</v>

84
00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:16.950
<v Speaker 1>and it might be this,</v>

85
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:17.860
<v Speaker 1>it might be you,</v>

86
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.630
<v Speaker 1>and this is why it's your fault.</v>

87
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.540
<v Speaker 1>You get accused Tori,</v>

88
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.970
<v Speaker 1>and then if you're listening to all that,</v>

89
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.120
<v Speaker 1>you have to just be patient and let the person get all their cards out on the</v>

90
00:03:30.731 --> 00:03:31.060
<v Speaker 1>table.</v>

91
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.000
<v Speaker 1>Even if some of that involves accusations about you,</v>

92
00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:35.450
<v Speaker 1>which you don't have to do immediately,</v>

93
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.160
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to immediately jump to the conclusion that those accusations are</v>

94
00:03:39.161 --> 00:03:41.020
<v Speaker 1>accurate or that you have to defend yourself.</v>

95
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.330
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

96
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.911
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not,</v>

97
00:03:42.911 --> 00:03:43.361
<v Speaker 1>believe me,</v>

98
00:03:43.361 --> 00:03:45.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying this is easy because it's not,</v>

99
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.620
<v Speaker 1>but you listen to the person lay out there,</v>

100
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.540
<v Speaker 1>their deck of complaints,</v>

101
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.370
<v Speaker 1>and the first thing you'll find is that they will take 50% or maybe more,</v>

102
00:03:54.371 --> 00:03:57.970
<v Speaker 1>75% of the cards off the table right away.</v>

103
00:03:57.971 --> 00:04:01.180
<v Speaker 1>Because once they've articulated out those concerns,</v>

104
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.970
<v Speaker 1>they'll find that they're not really central.</v>

105
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.350
<v Speaker 1>They're not really the issue.</v>

106
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.770
<v Speaker 1>And so that leaves a smaller number of genuine problems.</v>

107
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.830
<v Speaker 1>And then you can ask people again,</v>

108
00:04:11.831 --> 00:04:12.370
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

109
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.390
<v Speaker 1>here's the problem.</v>

110
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.160
<v Speaker 1>Can you think of any way,</v>

111
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.190
<v Speaker 1>if you could conceptualize how things would be better in relationship to that</v>

112
00:04:20.381 --> 00:04:20.770
<v Speaker 1>problem?</v>

113
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:23.560
<v Speaker 1>Well what would a solution look like even in principle?</v>

114
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.080
<v Speaker 1>And then they might say,</v>

115
00:04:26.081 --> 00:04:26.231
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

116
00:04:26.231 --> 00:04:26.921
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

117
00:04:26.921 --> 00:04:29.980
<v Speaker 1>And then they have to guess and lay their cards out on the table about what a</v>

118
00:04:29.981 --> 00:04:33.190
<v Speaker 1>solution might look like if they say they don't know,</v>

119
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.010
<v Speaker 1>that often means they don't want to think about it.</v>

120
00:04:36.011 --> 00:04:39.520
<v Speaker 1>And a little bit of encouragement isn't in order and maybe a little bit of</v>

121
00:04:39.521 --> 00:04:40.354
<v Speaker 1>pressure.</v>

122
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.273
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

123
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.070
<v Speaker 1>but you want people to formulate a vision of what the situation would look like</v>

124
00:04:45.071 --> 00:04:46.480
<v Speaker 1>if the problem was solved.</v>

125
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.930
<v Speaker 1>And then they might find it very daunting because the solution looks so</v>

126
00:04:49.931 --> 00:04:52.240
<v Speaker 1>difficult that they don't see any pathway to it.</v>

127
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.940
<v Speaker 1>And so then the next part of the discussion is,</v>

128
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.660
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

129
00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.010
<v Speaker 1>are there some things that you could do that would be small steps that you would</v>

130
00:05:00.011 --> 00:05:05.011
<v Speaker 1>be interested in doing that you think you would do that would move you to the</v>

131
00:05:05.051 --> 00:05:05.830
<v Speaker 1>solution?</v>

132
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.900
<v Speaker 1>And maybe those things could be implemented.</v>

133
00:05:07.901 --> 00:05:12.480
<v Speaker 1>Tentatively behavioral psychologists call that collaborative and parasitism.</v>

134
00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.810
<v Speaker 1>So you'll come and see a behavioral psychologist and lay out your problems and</v>

135
00:05:16.811 --> 00:05:19.000
<v Speaker 1>then the two of you will negotiate towards,</v>

136
00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

137
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:20.740
<v Speaker 1>the beginnings of a solution.</v>

138
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.450
<v Speaker 1>What could you do this week that might make that problem slightly better?</v>

139
00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.400
<v Speaker 1>And so you talked through what's practical and what's implementable.</v>

140
00:05:30.401 --> 00:05:34.300
<v Speaker 1>And you have to be honest about that because you don't want to set yourself up</v>

141
00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:35.920
<v Speaker 1>with a plan that's so complicated,</v>

142
00:05:35.921 --> 00:05:36.970
<v Speaker 1>you won't implement it.</v>

143
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.320
<v Speaker 1>Then you say to the person,</v>

144
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:39.460
<v Speaker 1>if you're the psychologist,</v>

145
00:05:39.461 --> 00:05:39.701
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

146
00:05:39.701 --> 00:05:40.420
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>

147
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.810
<v Speaker 1>we've got a couple of ideas about what you could do this week that might make</v>

148
00:05:43.811 --> 00:05:45.400
<v Speaker 1>this situation slightly better.</v>

149
00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.000
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you go and implement them and then come back next week and we'll talk</v>

150
00:05:49.001 --> 00:05:53.950
<v Speaker 1>about whether or not that worked and work would be you did implement it and that</v>

151
00:05:53.951 --> 00:05:55.570
<v Speaker 1>it did have the desired solution.</v>

152
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.710
<v Speaker 1>And if it didn't work,</v>

153
00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.260
<v Speaker 1>meaning you didn't implement it or the solution didn't emerge,</v>

154
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:01.580
<v Speaker 1>then there's,</v>

155
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.700
<v Speaker 1>there's the opportunity for renegotiation.</v>

156
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.620
<v Speaker 1>So you can think about it strategic.</v>

157
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.940
<v Speaker 1>The first issue is if something needs to be sorted out.</v>

158
00:06:10.941 --> 00:06:11.960
<v Speaker 1>The first question is,</v>

159
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.140
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

160
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.460
<v Speaker 1>what the hell is the problem?</v>

161
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.680
<v Speaker 1>And the answer that is,</v>

162
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:16.880
<v Speaker 1>you probably don't know.</v>

163
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.750
<v Speaker 1>The problem is I'm upset and disturbed and angry and resentful and bitter and</v>

164
00:06:20.751 --> 00:06:24.230
<v Speaker 1>unhappy and anxious and in pain and lonesome,</v>

165
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm suffering from an excess of negative emotion and perhaps from a certain</v>

166
00:06:28.401 --> 00:06:29.390
<v Speaker 1>amount of hopelessness.</v>

167
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:34.010
<v Speaker 1>So the problem is the emotional circumstance and that might be associated with</v>

168
00:06:34.011 --> 00:06:35.210
<v Speaker 1>some real problems,</v>

169
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:35.571
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

170
00:06:35.571 --> 00:06:36.920
<v Speaker 1>Some real practical problems.</v>

171
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.350
<v Speaker 1>So you lay all that out and say,</v>

172
00:06:39.351 --> 00:06:39.621
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

173
00:06:39.621 --> 00:06:42.530
<v Speaker 1>well what is the problem landscape look like?</v>

174
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:43.161
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

175
00:06:43.161 --> 00:06:44.840
<v Speaker 1>So that's the strategic move.</v>

176
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.650
<v Speaker 1>And then as I said that we'll generally simplify the problem landscape.</v>

177
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:49.790
<v Speaker 1>Then you do things,</v>

178
00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.220
<v Speaker 1>the same thing with a set of potential solutions.</v>

179
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.980
<v Speaker 1>Well what would the solutions look like?</v>

180
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.460
<v Speaker 1>Cause you're not going to be able to solve a problem unless you at least know</v>

181
00:06:58.461 --> 00:06:59.810
<v Speaker 1>what a solution might look like.</v>

182
00:06:59.811 --> 00:07:00.644
<v Speaker 1>That would actually,</v>

183
00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:01.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

184
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.560
<v Speaker 1>what would you say that would,</v>

185
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:05.240
<v Speaker 1>that you would find acceptable?</v>

186
00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:09.500
<v Speaker 1>And then the next pro issue is to lay out the strategies for the attainment of</v>

187
00:07:09.501 --> 00:07:10.334
<v Speaker 1>that solution.</v>

188
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:10.971
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

189
00:07:10.971 --> 00:07:14.720
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it might be some of these solutions might be dismal.</v>

190
00:07:14.721 --> 00:07:15.110
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

191
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

192
00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.050
<v Speaker 1>if you've got someone who's ill in your family,</v>

193
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:19.520
<v Speaker 1>the solution might be,</v>

194
00:07:19.521 --> 00:07:22.430
<v Speaker 1>well well we need a cure.</v>

195
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:23.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

196
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:25.250
<v Speaker 1>that's the only solution that will suffice.</v>

197
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:29.690
<v Speaker 1>But you don't know how to pursue the cure or maybe one doesn't exist.</v>

198
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
<v Speaker 1>And so then you have to think of while a lower order and less satisfying</v>

199
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:36.561
<v Speaker 1>solution,</v>

200
00:07:36.561 --> 00:07:37.101
<v Speaker 1>which would be,</v>

201
00:07:37.101 --> 00:07:39.080
<v Speaker 1>well maybe we can cope,</v>

202
00:07:39.081 --> 00:07:42.320
<v Speaker 1>we're going to learn to cope with this so that it's the least amount of hell</v>

203
00:07:42.321 --> 00:07:43.154
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

204
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:44.443
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

205
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:45.410
<v Speaker 1>and maybe that,</v>

206
00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:46.970
<v Speaker 1>maybe that even that's too much.</v>

207
00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:48.050
<v Speaker 1>You might have to say,</v>

208
00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:48.530
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

209
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:52.310
<v Speaker 1>we're going to try to make this next week when we're coping with this better</v>

210
00:07:52.311 --> 00:07:53.540
<v Speaker 1>than the last week.</v>

211
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:54.770
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

212
00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:55.603
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

213
00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:57.290
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you can't even do that.</v>

214
00:07:57.291 --> 00:07:59.180
<v Speaker 1>It has to just be the next day.</v>

215
00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:03.530
<v Speaker 1>You look for whatever small steps forward you can take that will make things</v>

216
00:08:03.531 --> 00:08:06.410
<v Speaker 1>less wretched and horrible than they currently are.</v>

217
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:07.230
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

218
00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:08.660
<v Speaker 1>to put it rather bluntly.</v>

219
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:12.140
<v Speaker 1>And that requires the willingness to face the problem,</v>

220
00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:15.800
<v Speaker 1>the humility to know that you don't have the solution at hand.</v>

221
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.790
<v Speaker 1>The willingness to listen to how the other people that you're talking to</v>

222
00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.480
<v Speaker 1>formulate the problems and formulate the solutions.</v>

223
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:24.680
<v Speaker 1>It's crucially important,</v>

224
00:08:24.681 --> 00:08:24.921
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

225
00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:26.930
<v Speaker 1>To have them do that work themselves.</v>

226
00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:27.710
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

227
00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:28.281
<v Speaker 1>it's also,</v>

228
00:08:28.281 --> 00:08:29.600
<v Speaker 1>you could think about it this way too,</v>

229
00:08:29.601 --> 00:08:33.200
<v Speaker 1>is that if you listen to someone come up with a solution,</v>

230
00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:39.160
<v Speaker 1>you don't undergo the neurological transformation is necessary to change your</v>

231
00:08:39.711 --> 00:08:40.544
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>

232
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:43.100
<v Speaker 1>But if you come up with the solutions yourself,</v>

233
00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:43.881
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

234
00:08:43.881 --> 00:08:46.880
<v Speaker 1>if you articulate the problem and you articulate the solutions,</v>

235
00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:51.410
<v Speaker 1>then you've changed your own character in a way that increases the probability</v>

236
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:52.670
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to act out.</v>

237
00:08:52.671 --> 00:08:53.504
<v Speaker 1>What you do.</v>

238
00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:58.350
<v Speaker 1>And that requires real patients to let people stumble through to their own</v>

239
00:08:58.351 --> 00:08:58.751
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>

240
00:08:58.751 --> 00:08:59.584
<v Speaker 1>solutions,</v>

241
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:02.010
<v Speaker 1>because someone might lay out a set of problems and you think,</v>

242
00:09:02.011 --> 00:09:02.581
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

243
00:09:02.581 --> 00:09:04.080
<v Speaker 1>I know what you could do about that,</v>

244
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.780
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't really matter if you know.</v>

245
00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:07.860
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

246
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:11.490
<v Speaker 1>And I'm also not saying that sometimes advice is helpful.</v>

247
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:12.360
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

248
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.010
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you can give someone a hint,</v>

249
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:14.731
<v Speaker 1>but man,</v>

250
00:09:14.731 --> 00:09:17.820
<v Speaker 1>you have to be careful with that because there's a real element of theft that's</v>

251
00:09:17.821 --> 00:09:18.540
<v Speaker 1>associated.</v>
