1
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.980
So one of our products is called the campus expression survey.

2
00:00:09.981 --> 00:00:14.960
It's a survey designed to actually measure who was afraid of speaking up about

3
00:00:14.961 --> 00:00:16.370
what topics and why,

4
00:00:16.371 --> 00:00:17.204
what are they afraid of?

5
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.510
And it turns out everyone's afraid of the students more than the faculty.

6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.440
They,

7
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.040
they're afraid of mostly to talk about race,

8
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.200
about the administrators.

9
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.280
Everyone's afraid of the students.

10
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:26.563
They were afraid of the students.

11
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.090
So I don't have,

12
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.150
we've not seen any of them.

13
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.350
I've only surveyed students.

14
00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:31.310
Okay.

15
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.540
But from what we hear,

16
00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:33.490
um,

17
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.830
uh,

18
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.050
people are afraid of,

19
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.950
of the students,

20
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.963
um,

21
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.540
you know,

22
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.910
well that's in its own manner.

23
00:00:40.911 --> 00:00:42.700
Like was that real year of leaders?

24
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.941
That's for sure.

25
00:00:43.941 --> 00:00:46.580
They let those kids come into the classroom,

26
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.000
the actual classroom and disrupt a class on an ongoing basis.

27
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.133
I mean,

28
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.630
yes.

29
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.690
And I couldn't understand that exactly.

30
00:00:53.691 --> 00:00:54.524
I mean,

31
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.910
my response to that would be first I would tell them to leave.

32
00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.481
Second,

33
00:00:59.481 --> 00:01:00.860
I would call campus security.

34
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.551
Third,

35
00:01:01.551 --> 00:01:02.600
if something wasn't done about it,

36
00:01:02.601 --> 00:01:03.950
I just wouldn't teach the class.

37
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.900
So I don't understand like it,

38
00:01:05.901 --> 00:01:09.200
it seems to me that it's also up to individual professors to draw a line,

39
00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:10.790
which is that if you're being intimidated,

40
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.960
dated by students,

41
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.160
why do you,

42
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.230
why do you show up and teach the class?

43
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.550
I don't understand that.

44
00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.340
So again,

45
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.840
people are afraid to stand up if it means that people will call you a racist,

46
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.913
Cabot God.

47
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:24.141
I mean,

48
00:01:24.141 --> 00:01:24.430
it's,

49
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.940
it's weird in that situation though,

50
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:26.260
it's,

51
00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.140
it's carried to third to go to your class,

52
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.630
you know,

53
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.870
and there's a much more proximal thread there.

54
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:32.590
That's what I mean.

55
00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.570
That's what I'm most alarmed by is the rise of intimidation.

56
00:01:35.571 --> 00:01:39.200
Intimidation is now a factor in many aspects of academic life.

57
00:01:39.201 --> 00:01:40.070
And that's just terrible.

58
00:01:40.071 --> 00:01:41.330
That's completely incompatible,

59
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:42.000
uh,

60
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.280
with,

61
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.790
with what we do and who we are.

62
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.241
Well,

63
00:01:44.241 --> 00:01:45.060
it's especially,

64
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.270
it's especially appalling given that whatever happens in the university

65
00:01:48.271 --> 00:01:48.811
campuses,

66
00:01:48.811 --> 00:01:49.021
you know,

67
00:01:49.021 --> 00:01:51.210
like one of the questions I've faced in Canada's,

68
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.481
well,

69
00:01:51.481 --> 00:01:54.660
why should we care about what's happening in the,

70
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.660
in the Ivy Towers are going to hire these people next year.

71
00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.271
Yeah.

72
00:01:58.271 --> 00:01:58.530
Well,

73
00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.280
it's the heart.

74
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.760
Like what's happening in the campuses is going to happen in society in five

75
00:02:02.761 --> 00:02:03.180
years.

76
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.170
It's already had goats.
