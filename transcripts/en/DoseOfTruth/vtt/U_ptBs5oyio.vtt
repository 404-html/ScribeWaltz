<v Speaker 1>Any advice for a person with intense chronic pain that wants to become,</v>

2
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.160
<v Speaker 1>who wants to become a uh,</v>

3
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:14.773
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:15.451
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

5
00:00:15.451 --> 00:00:16.284
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

6
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.690
<v Speaker 1>it switched on the other we go crayola sheeps has any advice for a person with</v>

7
00:00:21.691 --> 00:00:24.990
<v Speaker 1>intense chronic pain who wants to become a contributing member of society,</v>

8
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.200
<v Speaker 1>specifically having the self discipline to push through pain,</v>

9
00:00:28.201 --> 00:00:29.790
<v Speaker 1>to take care of responsibilities?</v>

10
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.541
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

11
00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:33.390
<v Speaker 1>the first thing I would say is that if you have intense chronic pain,</v>

12
00:00:33.391 --> 00:00:34.050
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

13
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.750
<v Speaker 1>my heart goes out to you because that's really awful.</v>

14
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.810
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that you can cut yourself a break.</v>

15
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.880
<v Speaker 1>I think the fact that you want to become or continue being a contributing member</v>

16
00:00:45.421 --> 00:00:48.330
<v Speaker 1>to society of society is a testament to your fortitude.</v>

17
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.170
<v Speaker 1>I guess the first thing I would ask you is if your pain has been reasonably</v>

18
00:00:52.171 --> 00:00:52.830
<v Speaker 1>managed,</v>

19
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:53.820
<v Speaker 1>you probably know this,</v>

20
00:00:53.821 --> 00:00:56.790
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not giving you any medical advice because I can't,</v>

21
00:00:56.791 --> 00:01:01.320
<v Speaker 1>but you might want to note that there are antidepressants that are quite</v>

22
00:01:01.321 --> 00:01:03.630
<v Speaker 1>effective as longterm pain medications,</v>

23
00:01:03.631 --> 00:01:04.890
<v Speaker 1>and you may already know that,</v>

24
00:01:04.891 --> 00:01:05.724
<v Speaker 1>but if you don't,</v>

25
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.290
<v Speaker 1>then you should check that out because they're not addictive and they can be a</v>

26
00:01:10.291 --> 00:01:11.520
<v Speaker 1>very effective adjunct.</v>

27
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.530
<v Speaker 1>I would also say that the literature on chronic pain tends to indicate that more</v>

28
00:01:16.531 --> 00:01:19.290
<v Speaker 1>activity is better than less and that,</v>

29
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.700
<v Speaker 1>and that's partly because when you get engaged in something that's meaningful,</v>

30
00:01:23.701 --> 00:01:24.534
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

31
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.310
<v Speaker 1>and important to you,</v>

32
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.510
<v Speaker 1>that that activates the dopaminergic system,</v>

33
00:01:30.511 --> 00:01:34.830
<v Speaker 1>the same system that cocaine activate sound that can produce a fairly pronounced</v>

34
00:01:34.831 --> 00:01:35.910
<v Speaker 1>analgesic effect.</v>

35
00:01:35.911 --> 00:01:40.620
<v Speaker 1>So I would say everything that you can do to get yourself occupied with things</v>

36
00:01:40.621 --> 00:01:43.620
<v Speaker 1>that you regard as important and worthwhile is actually probably going to help</v>

37
00:01:43.621 --> 00:01:44.940
<v Speaker 1>you manage your pain better.</v>

38
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.940
<v Speaker 1>It looks like inactivity is a bad,</v>

39
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.313
<v Speaker 1>is bad.</v>

40
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.400
<v Speaker 1>Generally speaking,</v>

41
00:01:50.401 --> 00:01:51.270
<v Speaker 1>for chronic pain,</v>

42
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

43
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.160
<v Speaker 1>obviously that's not the case.</v>

44
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.050
<v Speaker 1>If the sort of activity that you're engaged in is of the type that will</v>

45
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.860
<v Speaker 1>aggravate an underlying chronic physiological condition.</v>

46
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.450
<v Speaker 1>But I would say,</v>

47
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:04.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

48
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.130
<v Speaker 1>make a plan,</v>

49
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.480
<v Speaker 1>make a daily plan,</v>

50
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.770
<v Speaker 1>make a weekly plan,</v>

51
00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:08.640
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

52
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.473
<v Speaker 1>make it,</v>

53
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.081
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

54
00:02:10.081 --> 00:02:14.430
<v Speaker 1>push yourself a little bit farther than you can go comfortably on a weekly basis</v>

55
00:02:14.431 --> 00:02:16.350
<v Speaker 1>and see how far you can get any year.</v>

56
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.550
<v Speaker 1>That's because,</v>

57
00:02:17.551 --> 00:02:18.420
<v Speaker 1>what's your choice?</v>

58
00:02:18.421 --> 00:02:19.254
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

59
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.550
<v Speaker 1>you're laying there,</v>

60
00:02:20.551 --> 00:02:24.270
<v Speaker 1>suffering is not preferable to doing things and suffering,</v>

61
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.740
<v Speaker 1>not generally.</v>

62
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.370
<v Speaker 1>So I would say like more power to you for trying and,</v>

63
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.940
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

64
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.340
<v Speaker 1>but also do keep in mind that activity,</v>

65
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.310
<v Speaker 1>meaningful activity is a good analgesic.</v>

66
00:02:35.311 --> 00:02:36.144
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

67
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.020
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

68
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.250
<v Speaker 1>Eric Butler says,</v>

69
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.500
<v Speaker 1>sheesh Canadians never get it.</v>

70
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:41.131
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

71
00:02:41.131 --> 00:02:41.911
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know we'd get it.</v>

72
00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:42.770
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes there are,</v>

73
00:02:42.771 --> 00:02:43.500
<v Speaker 1>come on now,</v>

74
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.333
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

75
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.151
<v Speaker 1>give us a break.</v>

76
00:02:45.151 --> 00:02:45.511
<v Speaker 1>We're just,</v>

77
00:02:45.511 --> 00:02:47.730
<v Speaker 1>Canadians were freezing to death half the time.</v>

78
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.630
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

79
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.931
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

80
00:02:48.931 --> 00:02:52.800
<v Speaker 1>we do pretty well given the fact that every day here in the winter is the</v>

81
00:02:52.801 --> 00:02:56.910
<v Speaker 1>equivalent of a national catastrophe in the u s so anyways,</v>

82
00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:58.613
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

83
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.760
<v Speaker 1>Betsy Kirk lender says,</v>

84
00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:02.500
<v Speaker 1>if the second amendment is taken away,</v>

85
00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:04.720
<v Speaker 1>there will be nothing to protect your freedom of speech.</v>

86
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.010
<v Speaker 1>That is how important it is.</v>

87
00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:06.341
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

88
00:03:06.341 --> 00:03:08.860
<v Speaker 1>well not is certainly the argument that people who are,</v>

89
00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:10.340
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

90
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.530
<v Speaker 1>motivated to protect the second amendment make.</v>

91
00:03:13.531 --> 00:03:15.160
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not going to oppose that.</v>

92
00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:15.490
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
