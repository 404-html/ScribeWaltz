1
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:06.880
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.880
<v Speaker 1>so I'm talking today with Dr. Michael Shermer and darker Schermer is among other</v>

3
00:00:11.921 --> 00:00:12.221
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

4
00:00:12.221 --> 00:00:13.960
<v Speaker 1>the publisher of skeptic magazine,</v>

5
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.450
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly for our purposes today,</v>

6
00:00:16.451 --> 00:00:21.451
<v Speaker 1>he is also the author of this book New Book and were heaven on Earth.</v>

7
00:00:22.241 --> 00:00:24.850
<v Speaker 1>And we're going to talk about this today in some detail.</v>

8
00:00:24.851 --> 00:00:27.790
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm going to turn this over first too dark to Schermer who's going to</v>

9
00:00:27.791 --> 00:00:30.640
<v Speaker 1>tell you some things about himself and then we're going to have a discussion.</v>

10
00:00:30.641 --> 00:00:32.110
<v Speaker 1>He's going to outline this book to them.</v>

11
00:00:32.111 --> 00:00:33.430
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have a discussion about,</v>

12
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:34.220
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

13
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.570
<v Speaker 1>why he wrote it and what it contains and what the implications are and all of</v>

14
00:00:37.571 --> 00:00:37.871
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

15
00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:39.580
<v Speaker 1>So over to you Michael.</v>

16
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:41.180
<v Speaker 2>Sure,</v>

17
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.590
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

18
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.050
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for having me on the show.</v>

19
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.610
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

20
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.041
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

21
00:00:45.041 --> 00:00:47.890
<v Speaker 2>the book is kind of an extension of my previous work.</v>

22
00:00:47.891 --> 00:00:48.760
<v Speaker 2>Most of my books,</v>

23
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.811
<v Speaker 2>when I write them,</v>

24
00:00:49.811 --> 00:00:51.790
<v Speaker 2>they kind of push off from the previous book.</v>

25
00:00:51.791 --> 00:00:53.860
<v Speaker 2>So going all the way back to my first book,</v>

26
00:00:53.861 --> 00:00:55.180
<v Speaker 2>white people believe weird things,</v>

27
00:00:55.181 --> 00:00:57.870
<v Speaker 2>which was about the supernatural into paranormal and,</v>

28
00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.471
<v Speaker 2>and all that.</v>

29
00:00:59.471 --> 00:01:01.420
<v Speaker 2>Then then that led to how we believe,</v>

30
00:01:01.421 --> 00:01:03.010
<v Speaker 2>which was white people believe in God.</v>

31
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.210
<v Speaker 2>And then if you don't believe in the supernatural and you don't believe in a</v>

32
00:01:07.211 --> 00:01:07.631
<v Speaker 2>deity,</v>

33
00:01:07.631 --> 00:01:08.560
<v Speaker 2>what about morality?</v>

34
00:01:08.561 --> 00:01:12.220
<v Speaker 2>So I wrote two books on math and science of good and evil and the moral arc last</v>

35
00:01:12.221 --> 00:01:13.054
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>

36
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.931
<v Speaker 2>So then,</v>

37
00:01:13.931 --> 00:01:14.081
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

38
00:01:14.081 --> 00:01:16.390
<v Speaker 2>kind of covering all the big subjects.</v>

39
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.253
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

40
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.050
<v Speaker 2>from a skeptical scientific perspective,</v>

41
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.060
<v Speaker 2>the afterlife is obviously a huge one.</v>

42
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.660
<v Speaker 2>And I had really dealt with that too much and my previous books and you know,</v>

43
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.100
<v Speaker 2>now that I'm in my sixties,</v>

44
00:01:27.101 --> 00:01:28.840
<v Speaker 2>I guess you could say I'm cramming for the final</v>

45
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.200
<v Speaker 2>thinking about these big issues.</v>

46
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.940
<v Speaker 2>It's not something I obsess about it.</v>

47
00:01:33.941 --> 00:01:35.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm not terrorized by death like,</v>

48
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.100
<v Speaker 2>like some people that edge they are.</v>

49
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.210
<v Speaker 2>But I think it's a super interesting subject because it's obviously a part of</v>

50
00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:43.870
<v Speaker 2>the human condition.</v>

51
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.610
<v Speaker 2>It's something people do think about.</v>

52
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.060
<v Speaker 2>And apparently we're the only species that can do this.</v>

53
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.680
<v Speaker 2>Although I have a chapter and have designers on animals that grieve clearly.</v>

54
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.640
<v Speaker 2>Quite a few mammals do grieve and they have some sense of loss,</v>

55
00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.770
<v Speaker 2>death and grief for fellow group members or family members that die.</v>

56
00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.500
<v Speaker 2>There's not clear that they understand that their mortal.</v>

57
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.760
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

58
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.271
<v Speaker 2>and then like,</v>

59
00:02:07.271 --> 00:02:07.451
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

60
00:02:07.451 --> 00:02:12.310
<v Speaker 2>I covered the possibility that neanderthals were self aware of their mortality</v>

61
00:02:12.311 --> 00:02:14.440
<v Speaker 2>because of grave goods that have been found.</v>

62
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.333
<v Speaker 2>Although that's,</v>

63
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.120
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to,</v>

64
00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.420
<v Speaker 2>fossil fossil fossilization of thoughts is difficult to interpret,</v>

65
00:02:19.421 --> 00:02:22.120
<v Speaker 2>but it seems reasonable that they had some sense of that.</v>

66
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.080
<v Speaker 2>But in any case,</v>

67
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.973
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

68
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.611
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

69
00:02:24.611 --> 00:02:24.901
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>

70
00:02:24.901 --> 00:02:26.830
<v Speaker 2>I deal with the,</v>

71
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

72
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.810
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

73
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.150
<v Speaker 2>the monotheisms versions of the afterlife,</v>

74
00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:32.260
<v Speaker 2>Heaven and mortality,</v>

75
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:33.521
<v Speaker 2>a Judaism,</v>

76
00:02:33.521 --> 00:02:34.270
<v Speaker 2>Christianity,</v>

77
00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.670
<v Speaker 2>Islam mainly cause you sort of have to,</v>

78
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.530
<v Speaker 2>although mine's a science book and those are sort of low hanging fruit that</v>

79
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.520
<v Speaker 2>atheists have already kind of picked out.</v>

80
00:02:42.521 --> 00:02:44.500
<v Speaker 2>So I don't spend a lot of time on that.</v>

81
00:02:44.501 --> 00:02:44.581
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

82
00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:48.160
<v Speaker 2>I focused more on scientific attempts to achieve and mortality.</v>

83
00:02:48.161 --> 00:02:49.210
<v Speaker 2>And it's a book of science.</v>

84
00:02:49.211 --> 00:02:52.320
<v Speaker 2>So I actually start with what doesn't seem like a scientific get,</v>

85
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.650
<v Speaker 2>but Deepak Chopra's worldview of sort of western Buddhism that,</v>

86
00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.880
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

87
00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.670
<v Speaker 2>that there is the idea birth death.</v>

88
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.760
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

89
00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.650
<v Speaker 2>afterlives life before life is all kind of meaningless because it's all</v>

90
00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:09.460
<v Speaker 2>consciousness in a detox worldview as he puts it.</v>

91
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:10.120
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

92
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.331
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

93
00:03:10.331 --> 00:03:13.290
<v Speaker 2>consciousness is the ontological primitive free.</v>

94
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.130
<v Speaker 2>You can't get underneath it.</v>

95
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.730
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

96
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.971
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

97
00:03:15.971 --> 00:03:16.181
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

98
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:20.170
<v Speaker 2>the scientific attempt to explain it by material means will always fail because</v>

99
00:03:20.171 --> 00:03:22.690
<v Speaker 2>that's not where consciousness wise anyway.</v>

100
00:03:22.691 --> 00:03:23.524
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

101
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:24.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

102
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.880
<v Speaker 2>thanks to my wife,</v>

103
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

104
00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

105
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.790
<v Speaker 2>actually delved into his world view,</v>

106
00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.120
<v Speaker 2>Deepak and I have class for 20 years and I've called his worldview Wu and</v>

107
00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:34.520
<v Speaker 2>pseudoscience and,</v>

108
00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.860
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

109
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:35.051
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

110
00:03:35.051 --> 00:03:35.231
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

111
00:03:35.231 --> 00:03:36.850
<v Speaker 2>we've been kind of at odds at each other.</v>

112
00:03:36.851 --> 00:03:38.250
<v Speaker 2>So as it changes,</v>

113
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

114
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.420
<v Speaker 1>he sort of the main you,</v>

115
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.000
<v Speaker 1>I'd say intellectual force.</v>

116
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's unreasonable to say the main intellectual force behind the</v>

117
00:03:45.361 --> 00:03:48.120
<v Speaker 1>new age movement or associated with the new age movement.</v>

118
00:03:48.121 --> 00:03:48.954
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>

119
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.290
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

120
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.730
<v Speaker 2>certainly one of the most prominent ones.</v>

121
00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:53.200
<v Speaker 2>He's got a huge following.</v>

122
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.820
<v Speaker 2>He goes on Oprah and talks about these things and doctor Oz or whoever,</v>

123
00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.440
<v Speaker 2>and he has a lot of following.</v>

124
00:03:59.441 --> 00:03:59.990
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

125
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.823
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

126
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.510
<v Speaker 2>my wife and I actually went down to his center that 10% are in Carlsbad,</v>

127
00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:05.021
<v Speaker 2>California.</v>

128
00:04:05.021 --> 00:04:05.950
<v Speaker 2>And spent some time there.</v>

129
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.240
<v Speaker 2>I delved into meditation and Yoga and the tea and the chanting and all that</v>

130
00:04:10.241 --> 00:04:11.950
<v Speaker 2>stuff just to kind of see what it's all about.</v>

131
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.873
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

132
00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

133
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.300
<v Speaker 2>I think there's something there in terms of behavioral change that is how it</v>

134
00:04:16.301 --> 00:04:18.850
<v Speaker 2>affects your body and your mind and your thinking.</v>

135
00:04:18.851 --> 00:04:20.800
<v Speaker 2>And I could definitely see something to that.</v>

136
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:22.163
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

137
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.380
<v Speaker 2>but also the difficult part that deep buck and I have had is the same problem</v>

138
00:04:26.381 --> 00:04:30.580
<v Speaker 2>that most scientists have with new age beliefs,</v>

139
00:04:30.581 --> 00:04:31.150
<v Speaker 2>but not just that,</v>

140
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.350
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

141
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.350
<v Speaker 2>but non western traditions that Deepak calls the eastern wisdom traditions that</v>

142
00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:38.620
<v Speaker 2>it's the language,</v>

143
00:04:38.621 --> 00:04:39.730
<v Speaker 2>the difficulty of language.</v>

144
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.290
<v Speaker 2>We have to use words to communicate.</v>

145
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

146
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.850
<v Speaker 2>and the words you use matter at some level.</v>

147
00:04:45.851 --> 00:04:49.450
<v Speaker 2>You have to be able to be talking on the same level with words.</v>

148
00:04:49.451 --> 00:04:51.340
<v Speaker 2>So when Deepak says,</v>

149
00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:52.430
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

150
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

151
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.350
<v Speaker 2>the ontological primitive or consciousness is the womb of creation.</v>

152
00:04:56.351 --> 00:04:56.501
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

153
00:04:56.501 --> 00:04:57.040
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

154
00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.520
<v Speaker 2>it sounds sort of metaphorical and he means something very specific by that.</v>

155
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:01.930
<v Speaker 2>If you can't get at that,</v>

156
00:05:01.931 --> 00:05:03.940
<v Speaker 2>then you're wasting your time talking.</v>

157
00:05:03.941 --> 00:05:04.660
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

158
00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:05.160
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

159
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.050
<v Speaker 2>tee buck and I had kind of become friends and we,</v>

160
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

161
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.020
<v Speaker 2>we're constantly communicating just to try to see if we can find some ground</v>

162
00:05:11.021 --> 00:05:13.870
<v Speaker 2>where we're talking on the same plane.</v>

163
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.020
<v Speaker 2>And so I think I've,</v>

164
00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

165
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:16.760
<v Speaker 2>learned a lot from him in that,</v>

166
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:17.501
<v Speaker 2>in that sense.</v>

167
00:05:17.501 --> 00:05:22.060
<v Speaker 2>And so my chapters devoted to him on that and the general eastern wisdom</v>

168
00:05:22.061 --> 00:05:22.691
<v Speaker 2>traditions,</v>

169
00:05:22.691 --> 00:05:23.860
<v Speaker 2>you know that when you die,</v>

170
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.200
<v Speaker 2>cause I always ask them what,</v>

171
00:05:25.201 --> 00:05:25.780
<v Speaker 2>where do you go?</v>

172
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:26.170
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

173
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:27.460
<v Speaker 2>at least it's this the wrong question.</v>

174
00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean you just returned to where you were before.</v>

175
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:30.111
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

176
00:05:30.111 --> 00:05:31.120
<v Speaker 2>cause when people ask me,</v>

177
00:05:31.121 --> 00:05:32.800
<v Speaker 2>well what do you think happens after you die?</v>

178
00:05:32.801 --> 00:05:35.740
<v Speaker 2>My standard kind of quip is the same thing.</v>

179
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.870
<v Speaker 2>You go to the same place you worked before you were born.</v>

180
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.340
<v Speaker 2>I'll say,</v>

181
00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:40.151
<v Speaker 2>what are you talking about?</v>

182
00:05:40.151 --> 00:05:41.830
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't anywhere before I was born.</v>

183
00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.370
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

184
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:43.780
<v Speaker 2>And you'll be nowhere after you die.</v>

185
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:49.170
<v Speaker 2>But for depo time and consciousness kinda overrides the concept of time at the</v>

186
00:05:49.781 --> 00:05:54.781
<v Speaker 2>beginning and an end by your consciousness just returns to where it was and that</v>

187
00:05:55.031 --> 00:05:57.010
<v Speaker 2>the physical body and brain,</v>

188
00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.430
<v Speaker 2>just a temporary instantiation of consciousness into physical being.</v>

189
00:06:01.431 --> 00:06:03.800
<v Speaker 2>But it just goes back to some other place.</v>

190
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.600
<v Speaker 2>And then there's like a figure.</v>

191
00:06:05.601 --> 00:06:08.420
<v Speaker 2>We don't have the words to even conceive of what that means.</v>

192
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:09.091
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

193
00:06:09.091 --> 00:06:13.580
<v Speaker 2>that is the western language and the way scientists talk that can't really</v>

194
00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:16.400
<v Speaker 2>capture what he's talking about it in that sense.</v>

195
00:06:16.401 --> 00:06:19.260
<v Speaker 2>And so that's why I think we kind of hit a,</v>

196
00:06:19.261 --> 00:06:24.261
<v Speaker 2>an epistemological wall there where you have to actually get into introspection,</v>

197
00:06:24.501 --> 00:06:25.370
<v Speaker 2>meditation,</v>

198
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.320
<v Speaker 2>and the deeper parts of that tradition that I've never been able to really get</v>

199
00:06:30.321 --> 00:06:31.160
<v Speaker 2>into personally.</v>

200
00:06:31.161 --> 00:06:33.020
<v Speaker 2>So I can't say I understand it,</v>

201
00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.950
<v Speaker 2>although I kind of see where he's coming from in that regard.</v>
