1
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:07.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2
00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:08.601
<v Speaker 1>so okay,</v>

3
00:00:08.601 --> 00:00:13.601
<v Speaker 1>so your self serving and you construct a view of the world that serves those</v>

4
00:00:14.241 --> 00:00:17.600
<v Speaker 1>self serving causes and some of that has to do with power.</v>

5
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:19.423
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough.</v>

6
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.800
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean it all has to do with power.</v>

7
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.390
<v Speaker 1>It means that some of it has to do with power.</v>

8
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:27.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like racism.</v>

9
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.820
<v Speaker 1>People are kind of racist or maybe people prefer their ingroup.</v>

10
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.320
<v Speaker 1>It's not that easy or maybe people prefer the familiar to the novel.</v>

11
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.690
<v Speaker 1>You know that I eat that.</v>

12
00:00:38.691 --> 00:00:41.780
<v Speaker 1>The social psychologists have come up with implicit association test that</v>

13
00:00:41.781 --> 00:00:44.000
<v Speaker 1>measures unconscious bias.</v>

14
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.600
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what the hell that measures the people who invented that bloody</v>

15
00:00:47.601 --> 00:00:47.870
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

16
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:48.321
<v Speaker 1>They know.</v>

17
00:00:48.321 --> 00:00:49.460
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what it measures.</v>

18
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.560
<v Speaker 1>They know it's not reliable.</v>

19
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.820
<v Speaker 1>They know it's not valid enough to be used as an individual diagnostic</v>

20
00:00:55.821 --> 00:00:56.600
<v Speaker 1>instrument.</v>

21
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.220
<v Speaker 1>That's technically the case.</v>

22
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.260
<v Speaker 1>They also know that you can't train people out of their unconscious biases</v>

23
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.850
<v Speaker 1>because there was not much difference between unconscious bias and instantaneous</v>

24
00:01:07.851 --> 00:01:08.684
<v Speaker 1>perception,</v>

25
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.210
<v Speaker 1>but they don't really care.</v>

26
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.290
<v Speaker 1>I've written to Mazda and Bonci.</v>

27
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.570
<v Speaker 1>He's one of the inventors of the IAT several times saying,</v>

28
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.750
<v Speaker 1>how about you come out in public and say what you already know?</v>

29
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.990
<v Speaker 1>Which is that people are misusing your damn test.</v>

30
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.430
<v Speaker 1>Silence.</v>

31
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.571
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

32
00:01:26.571 --> 00:01:28.050
<v Speaker 1>that's partly because her discipline,</v>

33
00:01:28.051 --> 00:01:31.580
<v Speaker 1>social psychology is a corrupt discipline as the social psychologists have</v>

34
00:01:31.581 --> 00:01:33.380
<v Speaker 1>discovered over the last four years.</v>

35
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.610
<v Speaker 1>It'd be turning themselves inside out trying to rectify which they haven't.</v>

36
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.473
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

37
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.290
<v Speaker 1>we're giving the devil his due.</v>

38
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.680
<v Speaker 1>There's an infinite number of interpretations of the world and it's highly</v>

39
00:01:45.681 --> 00:01:48.800
<v Speaker 1>probable that you'll lay a self serving one on top of it.</v>

40
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.701
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

41
00:01:49.701 --> 00:01:51.830
<v Speaker 1>and also that will serve the interest of your group.</v>

42
00:01:51.831 --> 00:01:53.030
<v Speaker 1>However you define that.</v>

43
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.870
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

44
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.720
<v Speaker 1>but it only accounts for a fraction of your behavior.</v>

45
00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.230
<v Speaker 1>There's all sorts of other things at work as well and you don't get to reduce</v>

46
00:02:00.231 --> 00:02:03.050
<v Speaker 1>all human motivations to one motivation power.</v>

47
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:04.550
<v Speaker 1>And then you might also ask a,</v>

48
00:02:04.551 --> 00:02:07.280
<v Speaker 1>why would you want to reduce all human motivations to power?</v>

49
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.650
<v Speaker 1>It's so you can use power.</v>

50
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.990
<v Speaker 1>That's why you can justify the use of power that's force.</v>

51
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.330
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to engage in civilized debate.</v>

52
00:02:17.331 --> 00:02:18.980
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to give a damn about the facts,</v>

53
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.160
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're not a postmodernist cause you don't believe in facts</v>

54
00:02:22.161 --> 00:02:22.970
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>

55
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:23.631
<v Speaker 1>And you might ask,</v>

56
00:02:23.631 --> 00:02:23.751
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

57
00:02:23.751 --> 00:02:24.350
<v Speaker 1>why don't you,</v>

58
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.531
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

59
00:02:24.531 --> 00:02:25.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm not kidding.</v>

60
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:26.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm not kidding.</v>

61
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.760
<v Speaker 1>Postmodernists don't believe in facts.</v>

62
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
<v Speaker 1>They believe that the idea of fact is part of the power game that's place played</v>

63
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.820
<v Speaker 1>by the white dominated male patriarchy to impose the tyrannosaur structure of</v>

64
00:02:40.551 --> 00:02:42.770
<v Speaker 1>the Patriarchy on the oppressors.</v>

65
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm not making this stuff up.</v>

66
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.681
<v Speaker 1>It's embedded,</v>

67
00:02:45.681 --> 00:02:45.981
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

68
00:02:45.981 --> 00:02:46.611
<v Speaker 1>In theory,</v>

69
00:02:46.611 --> 00:02:49.760
<v Speaker 1>all you have to do is read it and you find this out.</v>

70
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.980
<v Speaker 1>So they don't believe in facts.</v>

71
00:02:51.981 --> 00:02:54.170
<v Speaker 1>What facts would constrain the use of power?</v>

72
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.360
<v Speaker 1>At least that's how it looks to me.</v>

73
00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

74
00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:59.301
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

75
00:02:59.301 --> 00:02:59.871
<v Speaker 1>So fine.</v>

76
00:02:59.871 --> 00:03:00.020
<v Speaker 1>We</v>

77
00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.100
<v Speaker 2>gave the devil his due.</v>

78
00:03:01.101 --> 00:03:05.990
<v Speaker 2>There's an infinite number of interpretations and you're likely to use bias,</v>

79
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.070
<v Speaker 2>compression algorithms on the world and they're likely to be biased in your</v>

80
00:03:10.071 --> 00:03:10.904
<v Speaker 2>favor.</v>

81
00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:12.493
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>

82
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.843
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

83
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.180
<v Speaker 2>only partly true.</v>

84
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.960
<v Speaker 1>And the difference between an idiot log and the thinker is that a thinker knows</v>

85
00:03:24.961 --> 00:03:29.190
<v Speaker 1>the difference between things that are only partly true and things that are</v>

86
00:03:29.191 --> 00:03:30.024
<v Speaker 1>completely true.</v>

87
00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.010
<v Speaker 1>Things are complicated.</v>

88
00:03:32.011 --> 00:03:32.191
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

89
00:03:32.191 --> 00:03:35.850
<v Speaker 1>I like to think everything is as complicated as a military helicopter.</v>

90
00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:37.470
<v Speaker 1>You have to like,</v>

91
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.680
<v Speaker 1>I think it's eight hours of maintenance to keep those things in the air for one</v>

92
00:03:40.681 --> 00:03:43.200
<v Speaker 1>hour because they don't fly like they're rocks.</v>

93
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.130
<v Speaker 1>They plummet.</v>

94
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.330
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard to keep them in the air and they're full of parts and you,</v>

95
00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:49.830
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't know all those parts,</v>

96
00:03:49.831 --> 00:03:52.860
<v Speaker 1>you don't go in there and monkey about with them because just wreck it.</v>

97
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.200
<v Speaker 1>And that's just a helicopter.</v>

98
00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.800
<v Speaker 1>Like everything is way more complicated than the helicopter.</v>

99
00:03:58.801 --> 00:04:01.740
<v Speaker 1>So you don't just go muck about in there hoping you're going to make it better.</v>

100
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.150
<v Speaker 1>That isn't how it works.</v>

101
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.860
<v Speaker 1>You need to be competent.</v>

102
00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:06.221
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

103
00:04:06.221 --> 00:04:07.054
<v Speaker 2>so look,</v>

104
00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.590
<v Speaker 1>here's where the postmodernists are wrong.</v>

105
00:04:09.591 --> 00:04:12.800
<v Speaker 1>I think there's three places and there's serious errors.</v>

106
00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.120
<v Speaker 1>The first is that there is an infinite number of interpretations,</v>

107
00:04:17.121 --> 00:04:19.750
<v Speaker 1>but there is not an infinite number of viable interpretation.</v>

108
00:04:19.751 --> 00:04:22.910
<v Speaker 1>So there's a very finite number of viable interpretations.</v>

109
00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.770
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think that this is theory.</v>

110
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.060
<v Speaker 1>I think that game theorists have already demonstrated this to some degree and</v>

111
00:04:29.061 --> 00:04:31.610
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be built into AI systems very rapidly.</v>

112
00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:32.031
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

113
00:04:32.031 --> 00:04:33.350
<v Speaker 1>so what are the constraints?</v>

114
00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.981
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

115
00:04:33.981 --> 00:04:34.521
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

116
00:04:34.521 --> 00:04:38.540
<v Speaker 1>you can't have an interpretation that leads to immediately to your death or your</v>

117
00:04:38.541 --> 00:04:39.230
<v Speaker 1>dad.</v>

118
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.471
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

119
00:04:39.471 --> 00:04:40.670
<v Speaker 1>if you want to be dead,</v>

120
00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:41.391
<v Speaker 1>that's fine,</v>

121
00:04:41.391 --> 00:04:42.500
<v Speaker 1>but if you don't want to be,</v>

122
00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.140
<v Speaker 1>then you got a lot of limited options,</v>

123
00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

124
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.090
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to run naked across an eight lane freeway at night blindfolded</v>

125
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.100
<v Speaker 1>because probably you'll be dead.</v>

126
00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.140
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad interpretation.</v>

127
00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.891
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

128
00:04:54.891 --> 00:04:59.030
<v Speaker 1>so you might say because you're fragile and vulnerable and mortal,</v>

129
00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.200
<v Speaker 1>that there's a limited number of ways that you can look at the world that don't</v>

130
00:05:03.201 --> 00:05:04.034
<v Speaker 1>result in,</v>

131
00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.700
<v Speaker 1>let's say death or serious damage or agony.</v>

132
00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:08.720
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad thing.</v>

133
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:09.830
<v Speaker 1>Agony is a bad thing.</v>

134
00:05:09.831 --> 00:05:11.360
<v Speaker 1>Most people agreed on that.</v>

135
00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.090
<v Speaker 1>So you're constrained by pain and anxiety.</v>

136
00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:19.190
<v Speaker 1>At least your interpretations are constrained by pain and anxiety and you know</v>

137
00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.120
<v Speaker 1>you can make pain worse or better by thinking about it to some degree,</v>

138
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.080
<v Speaker 1>but only to some degree when push comes to shove,</v>

139
00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.150
<v Speaker 1>pain is your master.</v>

140
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.951
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

141
00:05:30.951 --> 00:05:32.360
<v Speaker 1>So that's a big constraint.</v>

142
00:05:32.361 --> 00:05:33.081
<v Speaker 1>That's a big,</v>

143
00:05:33.081 --> 00:05:34.070
<v Speaker 1>big constraint.</v>

144
00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

145
00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.940
<v Speaker 1>but the constraints are worse than that because not only do you not get to have</v>

146
00:05:40.491 --> 00:05:44.270
<v Speaker 1>an interpretation of the world that produces anxiety and suffering right now,</v>

147
00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.550
<v Speaker 1>but you don't get to have an interpretation of the world that if you iterated</v>

148
00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.720
<v Speaker 1>across time produces pain and suffering.</v>

149
00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:52.250
<v Speaker 1>And so that's,</v>

150
00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.320
<v Speaker 1>that's a big problem because there's lots of,</v>

151
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.910
<v Speaker 1>you could go out tonight and get yourself drunk on cocaine and sleep with six</v>

152
00:05:58.911 --> 00:06:00.110
<v Speaker 1>hawkers and you know,</v>

153
00:06:00.111 --> 00:06:00.770
<v Speaker 1>maybe that,</v>

154
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.120
<v Speaker 1>maybe that'd be a good night.</v>

155
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.720
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

156
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.790
<v Speaker 1>you might not think about it being so good tomorrow,</v>

157
00:06:04.791 --> 00:06:08.810
<v Speaker 1>but then maybe you're dead of AIDS in a year or maybe you're addicted to cocaine</v>

158
00:06:08.811 --> 00:06:11.180
<v Speaker 1>or maybe you're a street alcoholic or whatever.</v>

159
00:06:11.181 --> 00:06:14.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like as an iterable game that's downhill.</v>

160
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.180
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is you play iterated games,</v>

161
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.931
<v Speaker 1>you don't play one,</v>

162
00:06:17.931 --> 00:06:19.250
<v Speaker 1>you play iterated games.</v>

163
00:06:19.251 --> 00:06:23.390
<v Speaker 1>And so your interpretation of the world has to be one that will sustain multiple</v>

164
00:06:23.391 --> 00:06:28.391
<v Speaker 1>iterations across time because you have to worry about 40 year olds and 60 year</v>

165
00:06:29.181 --> 00:06:30.014
<v Speaker 1>old you.</v>

166
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:31.460
<v Speaker 1>And that's a big problem.</v>

167
00:06:31.461 --> 00:06:32.570
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of used,</v>

168
00:06:32.571 --> 00:06:34.490
<v Speaker 1>stretched over a long period of time.</v>

169
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.190
<v Speaker 1>And it's worse than that because it's not just you.</v>

170
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.200
<v Speaker 1>It's like you and your family,</v>

171
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:40.431
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

172
00:06:40.431 --> 00:06:40.971
<v Speaker 1>And not only,</v>

173
00:06:40.971 --> 00:06:41.121
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

174
00:06:41.121 --> 00:06:44.660
<v Speaker 1>not only do you have to take care of yourself now in a manner that allows you to</v>

175
00:06:44.661 --> 00:06:49.340
<v Speaker 1>take care of yourself when you're 40 you have to take care of yourself now in a</v>

176
00:06:49.341 --> 00:06:54.200
<v Speaker 1>manner that takes care of you when you're 40 so that other people are happy to</v>

177
00:06:54.201 --> 00:06:58.970
<v Speaker 1>have you around now and continually so that they'll cooperate and compete with</v>

178
00:06:58.971 --> 00:07:00.680
<v Speaker 1>you in a positive way.</v>

179
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:03.860
<v Speaker 1>And so that's getting ridiculously complicated.</v>

180
00:07:03.861 --> 00:07:04.521
<v Speaker 1>It's not just you.</v>

181
00:07:04.521 --> 00:07:04.881
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

182
00:07:04.881 --> 00:07:05.720
<v Speaker 1>when you in the future,</v>

183
00:07:05.721 --> 00:07:09.860
<v Speaker 1>it's you surrounded by other people doing the same thing now and in the future.</v>

184
00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:11.660
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of other people,</v>

185
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.880
<v Speaker 1>it can even just be you and your family.</v>

186
00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:14.361
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

187
00:07:14.361 --> 00:07:14.900
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

188
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:19.580
<v Speaker 1>like the psychopathic burglar mob that's just not going to go so well,</v>

189
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:19.851
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

190
00:07:19.851 --> 00:07:23.330
<v Speaker 1>Other people are going to object and the world's going to object.</v>

191
00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:24.381
<v Speaker 1>And so fine,</v>

192
00:07:24.381 --> 00:07:26.390
<v Speaker 1>there's an infinite number of interpretations,</v>

193
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:29.300
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't mean there's an infinite number of viable interpretations.</v>

194
00:07:29.301 --> 00:07:29.870
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

195
00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:30.920
<v Speaker 1>there are hardly any,</v>

196
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:33.230
<v Speaker 1>there are hardly any playable games.</v>
