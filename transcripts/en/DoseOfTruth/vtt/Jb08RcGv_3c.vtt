00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.070
<v Speaker 1>Carl jung says that everything unconscious is projected into reality.</v>

2
00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:09.030
<v Speaker 1>How do you know if you are perceiving reality accurately or are just projecting?</v>

3
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:09.810
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

4
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:10.111
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5
00:00:10.111 --> 00:00:10.291
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

6
00:00:10.291 --> 00:00:12.180
<v Speaker 1>that's partly why I'm a pragmatist.</v>

7
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:13.620
<v Speaker 1>While there's a bunch of ways,</v>

8
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.823
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

9
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.440
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of ways that you know,</v>

10
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.480
<v Speaker 1>pain tells you</v>

11
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.560
<v Speaker 1>if you make a mistake and you hurt yourself while then you're stupid.</v>

12
00:00:22.561 --> 00:00:23.400
<v Speaker 1>Theory was wrong,</v>

13
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:23.671
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

14
00:00:23.671 --> 00:00:24.840
<v Speaker 1>That's what the pain says.</v>

15
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.830
<v Speaker 1>You're stupid theory was wrong and that's a pragmatic,</v>

16
00:00:27.831 --> 00:00:28.051
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>

17
00:00:28.051 --> 00:00:31.590
<v Speaker 1>that's another indication of pragmatic theory of truth.</v>

18
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:32.603
<v Speaker 1>You lay out.</v>

19
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.390
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

20
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.320
<v Speaker 1>when you look at the world,</v>

21
00:00:34.321 --> 00:00:36.720
<v Speaker 1>you look at the world with a set of presuppositions.</v>

22
00:00:36.721 --> 00:00:39.540
<v Speaker 1>I outlined that in chapter 10 in in rules,</v>

23
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.450
<v Speaker 1>in 12 rules for life called be precise in your speech.</v>

24
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.900
<v Speaker 1>It indicates that when you look at the world,</v>

25
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.640
<v Speaker 1>you look at it through a value structure.</v>

26
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.550
<v Speaker 1>You can't help that because you're always aiming at something in the world and</v>

27
00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:53.190
<v Speaker 1>you're always aiming at something you want and you're trying to get it.</v>

28
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.250
<v Speaker 1>And so that means that you look at the world through a value structure.</v>

29
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.550
<v Speaker 1>Now the question is whether or not that value structure is valid.</v>

30
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.800
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very complicated question.</v>

31
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:02.131
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

32
00:01:02.131 --> 00:01:03.510
<v Speaker 1>so how do you know if it's valid?</v>

33
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:04.560
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>

34
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.960
<v Speaker 1>you lay it out and you acted out,</v>

35
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.341
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

36
00:01:07.341 --> 00:01:09.780
<v Speaker 1>you implement it perceptually and then you act it out.</v>

37
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.760
<v Speaker 1>And if you get what you wanted,</v>

38
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.290
<v Speaker 1>what the theory predicted,</v>

39
00:01:13.291 --> 00:01:14.550
<v Speaker 1>that's another way of thinking about it,</v>

40
00:01:14.551 --> 00:01:16.440
<v Speaker 1>but wanted is a better way of thinking about it.</v>

41
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.510
<v Speaker 1>Then the fact that that behavioral routine and perceptual structure produced the</v>

42
00:01:21.511 --> 00:01:25.830
<v Speaker 1>intended result validates it as a tool for obtaining that result.</v>

43
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.270
<v Speaker 1>And that's a form of truth.</v>

44
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.740
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

45
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.240
<v Speaker 1>it might be the only form of truth,</v>

46
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.250
<v Speaker 1>although I'm not convinced of that completely.</v>

47
00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:33.084
<v Speaker 1>But it might be,</v>

48
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.650
<v Speaker 1>it's a very complicated question.</v>

49
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.341
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

50
00:01:35.341 --> 00:01:37.560
<v Speaker 1>how do you know if you're stupid theory is wrong?</v>

51
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:38.610
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

52
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.443
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>

53
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.070
<v Speaker 1>it fails and you're hurt.</v>

54
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.270
<v Speaker 1>Pain tells you,</v>

55
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.530
<v Speaker 1>you pragmatically,</v>

56
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:44.940
<v Speaker 1>your theory was wrong.</v>

57
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.240
<v Speaker 1>So that's why you should pay attention to your own pain because your suffering</v>

58
00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:50.400
<v Speaker 1>is indication that you still have things to learn.</v>

59
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.160
<v Speaker 1>And maybe the suffering of other people is also that,</v>

60
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.240
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

61
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.660
<v Speaker 1>maybe something unexpected or unpredictable happens when you're laying out your</v>

62
00:01:57.661 --> 00:02:00.660
<v Speaker 1>plan and then the anomalous manifest itself,</v>

63
00:02:00.661 --> 00:02:03.270
<v Speaker 1>the unexpected or chaos and then you get anxious.</v>

64
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.961
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

65
00:02:03.961 --> 00:02:06.150
<v Speaker 1>anxiety is an indication that your plan,</v>

66
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.710
<v Speaker 1>your Arrow didn't fly too.</v>

67
00:02:07.711 --> 00:02:11.880
<v Speaker 1>It's mark so you aimed wrong and that might mean a small error,</v>

68
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

69
00:02:12.511 --> 00:02:16.230
<v Speaker 1>maybe a tiny adjustment of your bowl or it might mean you just don't know what</v>

70
00:02:16.231 --> 00:02:18.510
<v Speaker 1>the hell you're doing at all and everything is lost.</v>

71
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.920
<v Speaker 1>And so anxiety tells you if your theory is wrong and then,</v>

72
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.560
<v Speaker 1>and then other people tell you that.</v>

73
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.490
<v Speaker 1>And that's why you want to surround yourself with other people because you</v>

74
00:02:29.491 --> 00:02:32.040
<v Speaker 1>distribute your cognitive resources.</v>

75
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.993
<v Speaker 1>Ew,</v>

76
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.570
<v Speaker 1>ew.</v>

77
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.570
<v Speaker 1>You distribute your problems to the cognitive resources of the social group.</v>

78
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.160
<v Speaker 1>That's what we do when we price things,</v>

79
00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:41.371
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

80
00:02:41.371 --> 00:02:44.760
<v Speaker 1>Everyone votes on the price of something because it's so difficult because the</v>

81
00:02:44.761 --> 00:02:47.940
<v Speaker 1>price of something has to be established in relationship to the price of</v>

82
00:02:47.941 --> 00:02:48.774
<v Speaker 1>everything else.</v>

83
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.640
<v Speaker 1>And that's always in flux and so it's computationally impossible problem.</v>

84
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.890
<v Speaker 1>And so we outsource it to the market,</v>

85
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.950
<v Speaker 1>which is the free cognitive decision of millions of people.</v>

86
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.540
<v Speaker 1>And that's how we determined price.</v>

87
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.260
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things you do to make sure that you're not any stupider than</v>

88
00:03:05.261 --> 00:03:06.610
<v Speaker 1>you have to be blind,</v>

89
00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:07.210
<v Speaker 1>ignorant,</v>

90
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.811
<v Speaker 1>biased,</v>

91
00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:11.590
<v Speaker 1>and all of that is you surround yourself with other people and you try to treat</v>

92
00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:13.450
<v Speaker 1>them well enough so that they can tolerate you.</v>

93
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.960
<v Speaker 1>And then every time that you do something stupid because one of your theories</v>

94
00:03:16.961 --> 00:03:17.730
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

95
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.260
<v Speaker 1>is vague or incomplete or wrong or biased,</v>

96
00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:21.340
<v Speaker 1>or you're willfully blind,</v>

97
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.170
<v Speaker 1>then they slap you on the side of the head.</v>

98
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.240
<v Speaker 1>They ignore you because you're boring.</v>

99
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.430
<v Speaker 1>They don't laugh at your jokes because they're stupid.</v>

100
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:28.230
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

101
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.900
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

102
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.180
<v Speaker 1>they are irritated at your auctions because you're not taking your own longterm</v>

103
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.560
<v Speaker 1>interests or the interests of other people into account.</v>

104
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.780
<v Speaker 1>And so you have pain,</v>

105
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:38.980
<v Speaker 1>you have anxiety,</v>

106
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.280
<v Speaker 1>you have the reward of success that that's,</v>

107
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.560
<v Speaker 1>that's a positive indicator that your theory is okay.</v>

108
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.960
<v Speaker 1>And then you have the reactions of everyone else.</v>

109
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.480
<v Speaker 1>And if you're clued in,</v>

110
00:03:49.481 --> 00:03:52.840
<v Speaker 1>you pay attention to all of those things and you try to update your,</v>

111
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.310
<v Speaker 1>your order,</v>

112
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.960
<v Speaker 1>which is your perceptions.</v>

113
00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.920
<v Speaker 1>You try to update your order constantly as a consequence of being humble in the</v>

114
00:03:59.921 --> 00:04:00.940
<v Speaker 1>face of your errors,</v>

115
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.240
<v Speaker 1>which is why humility is the precondition of her learning and why it's one of</v>

116
00:04:04.241 --> 00:04:05.500
<v Speaker 1>the highest moral virtues.</v>

117
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.640
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
