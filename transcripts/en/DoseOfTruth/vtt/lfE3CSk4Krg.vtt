1
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:12.751
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2
00:00:12.751 --> 00:00:13.584
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

3
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.760
<v Speaker 1>now we're going to talk about the phenomenal logical existential slash</v>

4
00:00:19.891 --> 00:00:24.891
<v Speaker 1>phenomenological psych guy trusts and their theories from the 1950s.</v>

5
00:00:25.471 --> 00:00:26.940
<v Speaker 1>And as I mentioned to you before,</v>

6
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.800
<v Speaker 1>a lot of their thinking was motivated by what had happened in World War II.</v>

7
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:32.421
<v Speaker 1>When I,</v>

8
00:00:32.421 --> 00:00:33.750
<v Speaker 1>when I lecture to you last,</v>

9
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.330
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

10
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:35.163
<v Speaker 1>I pointed out,</v>

11
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.070
<v Speaker 1>I described Nietzschean Dostoyevsky's summation of the world situation and</v>

12
00:00:41.071 --> 00:00:43.950
<v Speaker 1>really the world psychological situation at the end of the 18 hundreds.</v>

13
00:00:43.951 --> 00:00:44.784
<v Speaker 1>And that was that</v>

14
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.800
<v Speaker 1>our new modes of thinking had undermined our faith and our old modes of</v>

15
00:00:49.801 --> 00:00:50.251
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>

16
00:00:50.251 --> 00:00:53.400
<v Speaker 1>And that was a problem because people need something firm to stand on,</v>

17
00:00:53.401 --> 00:00:55.350
<v Speaker 1>to orient themselves and to move forward.</v>

18
00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.120
<v Speaker 1>And so Nietzschean Dostoyevsky basically both prophesied that the consequence of</v>

19
00:01:00.121 --> 00:01:01.500
<v Speaker 1>that dissolution would be,</v>

20
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.580
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

21
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.120
<v Speaker 1>increased probability of nihilism and everything that went along with that.</v>

22
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.810
<v Speaker 1>And Dostoevsky wrote about that actually quite extensively in a book called</v>

23
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.070
<v Speaker 1>notes from underground,</v>

24
00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:12.510
<v Speaker 1>which if any of you are interested,</v>

25
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.250
<v Speaker 1>especially in clinical psychology,</v>

26
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.550
<v Speaker 1>that's a book you should really read because it's one of the most brilliant</v>

27
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.380
<v Speaker 1>psychological studies of,</v>

28
00:01:19.381 --> 00:01:19.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

29
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.831
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

30
00:01:19.831 --> 00:01:20.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

31
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.401
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

32
00:01:20.401 --> 00:01:21.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

33
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.600
<v Speaker 1>psychologically disturbed man that's ever been written.</v>

34
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.500
<v Speaker 1>It's very accurate.</v>

35
00:01:25.501 --> 00:01:27.990
<v Speaker 1>And there are sections in crime and punishment that are like that too.</v>

36
00:01:27.991 --> 00:01:31.410
<v Speaker 1>I think there are unsurpassed in their representation of,</v>

37
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:32.723
<v Speaker 1>of psych,</v>

38
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.360
<v Speaker 1>of psychological phenomena.</v>

39
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.413
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

40
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how he managed it.</v>

41
00:01:37.951 --> 00:01:38.221
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

42
00:01:38.221 --> 00:01:40.020
<v Speaker 1>Dostoyevsky was epileptic,</v>

43
00:01:40.021 --> 00:01:41.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know that,</v>

44
00:01:41.191 --> 00:01:42.210
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

45
00:01:42.211 --> 00:01:43.044
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

46
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.550
<v Speaker 1>he was arrested by the czar's men in the late 18 hundreds for being a student</v>

47
00:01:47.551 --> 00:01:52.551
<v Speaker 1>radical and they throw them in the main prison in Moscow.</v>

48
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.480
<v Speaker 1>And then one day they took them out in front of a firing squad and shot him at</v>

49
00:01:57.481 --> 00:01:58.314
<v Speaker 1>six in the morning,</v>

50
00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.610
<v Speaker 1>but they only use blanks,</v>

51
00:01:59.611 --> 00:02:00.960
<v Speaker 1>which of course he didn't know about.</v>

52
00:02:00.961 --> 00:02:03.270
<v Speaker 1>And that scared him so badly.</v>

53
00:02:03.271 --> 00:02:05.130
<v Speaker 1>He developed epilepsy and then he had epilepsy.</v>

54
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.270
<v Speaker 1>That can happen by the way.</v>

55
00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:07.443
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

56
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.900
<v Speaker 1>if Andy had epilepsy for the rest of his life,</v>

57
00:02:09.901 --> 00:02:11.550
<v Speaker 1>but he had this strange kind of epilepsy,</v>

58
00:02:11.551 --> 00:02:13.650
<v Speaker 1>which is actually not all that rare.</v>

59
00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.191
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

60
00:02:14.191 --> 00:02:15.780
<v Speaker 1>sometimes when people have epilepsy,</v>

61
00:02:15.781 --> 00:02:17.550
<v Speaker 1>they experienced this phenomena.</v>

62
00:02:17.551 --> 00:02:18.480
<v Speaker 1>They call an aura,</v>

63
00:02:18.481 --> 00:02:21.810
<v Speaker 1>which is an altered state of consciousness before the epileptic seizure hits.</v>

64
00:02:21.811 --> 00:02:23.330
<v Speaker 1>And they can be very strange these auras.</v>

65
00:02:23.331 --> 00:02:26.010
<v Speaker 1>So I read a case study once about a guy who,</v>

66
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.203
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

67
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.350
<v Speaker 1>his aura was that his hand was being possessed by devils from hell,</v>

68
00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:35.040
<v Speaker 1>and he could feel the possession move up his arm and into his shoulder.</v>

69
00:02:35.041 --> 00:02:35.880
<v Speaker 1>And once it hit his head,</v>

70
00:02:35.881 --> 00:02:37.170
<v Speaker 1>he'd have an epileptic seizure.</v>

71
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.750
<v Speaker 1>And so then there was another case,</v>

72
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.173
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

73
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.970
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

74
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:42.810
<v Speaker 1>where this man,</v>

75
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.380
<v Speaker 1>his aura was that his exact double had appeared behind him.</v>

76
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.031
<v Speaker 1>But if you turn it,</v>

77
00:02:48.031 --> 00:02:48.900
<v Speaker 1>and if you turn to look,</v>

78
00:02:48.901 --> 00:02:50.220
<v Speaker 1>then he'd have an epileptic seizure.</v>

79
00:02:50.221 --> 00:02:52.290
<v Speaker 1>But if he didn't turn to look that he wouldn't.</v>

80
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.850
<v Speaker 1>So these brain disorders are very strange things because they're,</v>

81
00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.840
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

82
00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.810
<v Speaker 1>the system that is disordered is alive and it's capable of any number of</v>

83
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.000
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily peculiar misbehaviors.</v>

84
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.421
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

85
00:03:04.421 --> 00:03:09.150
<v Speaker 1>Dostoyevsky's aura was a world revealing aura.</v>

86
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.330
<v Speaker 1>And so what Dostoyevsky would experience was that the meaning of things got</v>

87
00:03:13.331 --> 00:03:15.670
<v Speaker 1>deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper.</v>

88
00:03:15.671 --> 00:03:19.570
<v Speaker 1>And then just as he was on the verge of discovering the secret to everything,</v>

89
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.100
<v Speaker 1>he'd have an epileptic seizure.</v>

90
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.200
<v Speaker 1>But he said that the quality of experience during the aura was so high,</v>

91
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.550
<v Speaker 1>so overpowering and so deep that he would have traded all of his normal</v>

92
00:03:30.551 --> 00:03:34.030
<v Speaker 1>experience just to have had those experiences and have them repeatedly.</v>

93
00:03:34.031 --> 00:03:38.620
<v Speaker 1>And I really do believe that it was this broadening of his,</v>

94
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.580
<v Speaker 1>of his vision and concept by his epilepsy that transformed them.</v>

95
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:43.540
<v Speaker 1>Among other things.</v>

96
00:03:43.541 --> 00:03:43.781
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

97
00:03:43.781 --> 00:03:47.050
<v Speaker 1>he went through some pretty damn rough experiences because he was in prison with</v>

98
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.170
<v Speaker 1>rapists and murderers for a long time in Siberia,</v>

99
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.580
<v Speaker 1>even though he was kind of an aristocratic guy.</v>

100
00:03:52.581 --> 00:03:52.781
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

101
00:03:52.781 --> 00:03:53.410
<v Speaker 1>he had a,</v>

102
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.760
<v Speaker 1>he had a rough time of it.</v>

103
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.431
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

104
00:03:55.431 --> 00:04:00.160
<v Speaker 1>I imagine that that also broadened him tremendously given that it didn't kill</v>

105
00:04:00.161 --> 00:04:00.910
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

106
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:01.300
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

107
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

108
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.950
<v Speaker 1>I really do believe that the epileptic insight was key to his,</v>

109
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.230
<v Speaker 1>like his unsurpassed genius.</v>

110
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:09.543
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

111
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.560
<v Speaker 1>and the his aura and other people do experience epileptic or a symptoms like</v>

112
00:04:14.561 --> 00:04:14.741
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

113
00:04:14.741 --> 00:04:15.131
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

114
00:04:15.131 --> 00:04:18.840
<v Speaker 1>And some people are so enamored of the aura that they won't take their auntie</v>

115
00:04:18.841 --> 00:04:22.450
<v Speaker 1>epilepsy medication because they don't want to forego the experience that</v>

116
00:04:22.451 --> 00:04:26.650
<v Speaker 1>precedes the aura or the actual actual epileptic seizure.</v>

117
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.130
<v Speaker 1>So Dostoyevsky's experiences,</v>

118
00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.661
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

119
00:04:30.661 --> 00:04:35.230
<v Speaker 1>the op element of the aura is also relevant to what we're going to talk about</v>

120
00:04:35.231 --> 00:04:38.560
<v Speaker 1>today because both been swagger and boss.</v>

121
00:04:38.561 --> 00:04:42.190
<v Speaker 1>We're very interested in how meaning revealed itself in the world.</v>

122
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:43.150
<v Speaker 1>And they had an,</v>

123
00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.130
<v Speaker 1>they had opposing explanations.</v>

124
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.370
<v Speaker 1>I actually think they're parallel explanations,</v>

125
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.630
<v Speaker 1>but the meaning that Dostoyevsky experienced is,</v>

126
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.130
<v Speaker 1>is an amplification of the normal manner in which meaning reveals itself in the</v>

127
00:04:57.131 --> 00:04:57.964
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

128
00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.980
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>

129
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:04.390
<v Speaker 1>and people experience that sort of thing in various altered states of</v>

130
00:05:04.391 --> 00:05:05.080
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
