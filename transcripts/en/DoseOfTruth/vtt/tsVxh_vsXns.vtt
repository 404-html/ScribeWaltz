00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:07.700
<v Speaker 1>People generally assume,</v>

2
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.770
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing that I could do this risk and the baseline they compare that to</v>

3
00:00:12.771 --> 00:00:13.670
<v Speaker 1>is no risk.</v>

4
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:14.810
<v Speaker 1>But that's wrong.</v>

5
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:15.793
<v Speaker 1>Always.</v>

6
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.470
<v Speaker 1>It's risky or risky.</v>

7
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.980
<v Speaker 1>It's the risk of doing something versus the risk of not doing something or if</v>

8
00:00:21.981 --> 00:00:23.540
<v Speaker 1>the risk of doing this instead of this,</v>

9
00:00:23.541 --> 00:00:24.890
<v Speaker 1>it's like risk is everywhere.</v>

10
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.780
<v Speaker 1>So do people make foolish risks while sometimes,</v>

11
00:00:29.781 --> 00:00:34.781
<v Speaker 1>obviously it's foolish to go play slot machine because the bloody thing is</v>

12
00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:35.840
<v Speaker 1>stacked against you.</v>

13
00:00:35.841 --> 00:00:37.280
<v Speaker 1>So on average you're going to lose.</v>

14
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.430
<v Speaker 1>But you can't tell that to the person who just won the jackpot.</v>

15
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.850
<v Speaker 1>Well the gamble partly because it's fun,</v>

16
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.441
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:00:45.441 --> 00:00:46.270
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

18
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.270
<v Speaker 1>and I mean that technically most of the neurochemicals that your brain producers</v>

19
00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:57.020
<v Speaker 1>that are associated with the kind of pleasure that people really like,</v>

20
00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.000
<v Speaker 1>which is like for example,</v>

21
00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:03.680
<v Speaker 1>the kind of pleasure that drugs like cocaine produce are produced by um,</v>

22
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.910
<v Speaker 1>risky,</v>

23
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:05.600
<v Speaker 1>hi,</v>

24
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.660
<v Speaker 1>risky behavior that has the potential for high return.</v>

25
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.430
<v Speaker 1>We liked that sort of thing.</v>

26
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.530
<v Speaker 1>And people are wired so that they're more responsive to the probability of</v>

27
00:01:15.531 --> 00:01:18.290
<v Speaker 1>something good happening then even to the good thing.</v>

28
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.341
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

29
00:01:19.341 --> 00:01:19.911
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

30
00:01:19.911 --> 00:01:21.470
<v Speaker 1>we know that if people win the lottery,</v>

31
00:01:21.471 --> 00:01:22.161
<v Speaker 1>I'll be here later.</v>

32
00:01:22.161 --> 00:01:23.510
<v Speaker 1>They're about the same as they were,</v>

33
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.591
<v Speaker 1>no better,</v>

34
00:01:24.591 --> 00:01:25.424
<v Speaker 1>no worse.</v>

35
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.030
<v Speaker 1>So actually winning all that money has a limited longterm impact on their</v>

36
00:01:31.251 --> 00:01:31.801
<v Speaker 1>happiness.</v>

37
00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:34.520
<v Speaker 1>That's probably more determined by their tray temperament,</v>

38
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.250
<v Speaker 1>but the lead up to the good event,</v>

39
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.480
<v Speaker 1>that's the exciting part.</v>

40
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:39.380
<v Speaker 1>It might happen.</v>

41
00:01:39.381 --> 00:01:40.214
<v Speaker 1>It might happen.</v>

42
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.330
<v Speaker 1>That's excitement.</v>

43
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.300
<v Speaker 1>And that's produced by like gambling.</v>

44
00:01:44.301 --> 00:01:44.931
<v Speaker 1>What produced that?</v>

45
00:01:44.931 --> 00:01:46.190
<v Speaker 1>Especially for some people,</v>

46
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.040
<v Speaker 1>because some people are really susceptible to that kind of reward.</v>

47
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.980
<v Speaker 1>Everyone susceptible to it to some degree,</v>

48
00:01:51.981 --> 00:01:55.070
<v Speaker 1>and that can be manipulated and that's what a slot machines do.</v>

49
00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.290
<v Speaker 1>Like slot machines manipulate the human propensity to engage in a certain kind</v>

50
00:02:00.291 --> 00:02:01.310
<v Speaker 1>of gambling behavior.</v>

51
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.170
<v Speaker 1>And why do people gamble?</v>

52
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.040
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes taking a risk really pays off and not taking a risk is also a risk.</v>

53
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.880
<v Speaker 1>So there's no way out of risk.</v>

54
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.740
<v Speaker 1>It's to gamble one way or another.</v>
