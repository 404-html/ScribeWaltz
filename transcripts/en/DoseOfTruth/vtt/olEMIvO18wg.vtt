1
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.760
<v Speaker 1>And I'm going to compare the Marxist theory of suffering to the Judeo Christian</v>

2
00:00:10.761 --> 00:00:13.760
<v Speaker 1>theory of suffering and the Judeo Christian would be.</v>

3
00:00:13.761 --> 00:00:17.060
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I'm doing that is because I think the Judeo Christian theory of</v>

4
00:00:17.061 --> 00:00:21.020
<v Speaker 1>suffering is actually one of the foundation stones of our entire culture.</v>

5
00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:24.560
<v Speaker 1>And so it actually matters why you think they're suffering.</v>

6
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.750
<v Speaker 1>And so the story that describes the entry of suffering into the world,</v>

7
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.570
<v Speaker 1>that mythological story is the story in Genesis,</v>

8
00:00:32.571 --> 00:00:33.650
<v Speaker 1>the story of Adam and eve.</v>

9
00:00:33.651 --> 00:00:37.160
<v Speaker 1>And basically what happens in the story of Adam and Eve is Adam and eve are</v>

10
00:00:37.161 --> 00:00:38.630
<v Speaker 1>unconscious to begin with.</v>

11
00:00:38.631 --> 00:00:42.290
<v Speaker 1>And they're sort of in this paradise will state there's no death or at least</v>

12
00:00:42.291 --> 00:00:43.430
<v Speaker 1>there's no knowledge of death.</v>

13
00:00:43.431 --> 00:00:45.680
<v Speaker 1>There's also no knowledge of self.</v>

14
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.510
<v Speaker 1>And then eve eats the apple that the serpent gives her and the scales fall from</v>

15
00:00:50.511 --> 00:00:55.511
<v Speaker 1>her eyes and she gives the apple to Adam and he eats it as well.</v>

16
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.320
<v Speaker 1>So she makes him self conscious.</v>

17
00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.400
<v Speaker 1>They both wake up.</v>

18
00:00:58.401 --> 00:01:02.360
<v Speaker 1>The first thing that happens is they realize that they're naked and they cover</v>

19
00:01:02.361 --> 00:01:03.141
<v Speaker 1>themselves up.</v>

20
00:01:03.141 --> 00:01:06.380
<v Speaker 1>And the second thing that happens as a consequence of that realization is that</v>

21
00:01:06.381 --> 00:01:10.400
<v Speaker 1>they come to know the difference between good and evil and I mean that's a</v>

22
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.520
<v Speaker 1>insanely complicated story that's dealing with a re absolutely incomprehensible</v>

23
00:01:17.181 --> 00:01:22.181
<v Speaker 1>number of complex phenomena simultaneously but it basically goes something like</v>

24
00:01:22.821 --> 00:01:27.821
<v Speaker 1>this is that to be aware that you're naked is to be aware of your fragility and</v>

25
00:01:29.871 --> 00:01:30.681
<v Speaker 1>your mortality.</v>

26
00:01:30.681 --> 00:01:34.040
<v Speaker 1>When when you have a nightmare about being naked in front of a crowd,</v>

27
00:01:34.041 --> 00:01:36.350
<v Speaker 1>it means that you're exposed to the crowd,</v>

28
00:01:36.351 --> 00:01:37.280
<v Speaker 1>all your flaws,</v>

29
00:01:37.281 --> 00:01:42.110
<v Speaker 1>all your mortal vulnerability is exposed to the crowd for for for them to see,</v>

30
00:01:42.111 --> 00:01:44.660
<v Speaker 1>for you to be ashamed of for them to judge.</v>

31
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.800
<v Speaker 1>That's partly why we're all close.</v>

32
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.740
<v Speaker 1>That's partly why human being human.</v>

33
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.110
<v Speaker 1>Why clothing is a human universal.</v>

34
00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:53.060
<v Speaker 1>There's many human universals by the way,</v>

35
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.500
<v Speaker 1>clothing is one of them although it's used for many different purposes so Adam</v>

36
00:01:57.501 --> 00:02:01.190
<v Speaker 1>and eve cover themselves up and so because they've realized that they're,</v>

37
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:02.750
<v Speaker 1>that they're vulnerable,</v>

38
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:03.770
<v Speaker 1>they're naked and vulnerable.</v>

39
00:02:03.771 --> 00:02:04.970
<v Speaker 1>That self consciousness,</v>

40
00:02:04.971 --> 00:02:06.890
<v Speaker 1>human beings are self conscious animals.</v>

41
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.530
<v Speaker 1>We're really the only self conscious animals.</v>

42
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.430
<v Speaker 1>Other animals have the glimmerings of self consciousness.</v>

43
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.490
<v Speaker 1>Some of them can identify themselves in a mirror for example,</v>

44
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.860
<v Speaker 1>but we have whole theories of ourselves.</v>

45
00:02:18.861 --> 00:02:23.750
<v Speaker 1>We have whole articulated verbal and philosophical theories of what a human</v>

46
00:02:23.751 --> 00:02:25.910
<v Speaker 1>being is and what we each are as individuals.</v>

47
00:02:25.911 --> 00:02:28.550
<v Speaker 1>So really those aren't in the same conceptual universe.</v>

48
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.780
<v Speaker 1>It's a whole different,</v>

49
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.360
<v Speaker 1>it's a qualitatively different issue.</v>

50
00:02:32.361 --> 00:02:34.470
<v Speaker 1>In the case of human beings were self conscious,</v>

51
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.750
<v Speaker 1>self consciousness,</v>

52
00:02:35.751 --> 00:02:39.480
<v Speaker 1>loads on trait neuroticism technically speaking which means that self</v>

53
00:02:39.481 --> 00:02:43.250
<v Speaker 1>consciousness is primarily something that manifest itself in the form of</v>

54
00:02:43.251 --> 00:02:45.860
<v Speaker 1>negative emotion and we all know that you're on stage,</v>

55
00:02:45.861 --> 00:02:46.940
<v Speaker 1>you get self conscious.</v>

56
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.200
<v Speaker 1>Is that a good thing?</v>

57
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.333
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

58
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.650
<v Speaker 1>you can give so self conscious that your tongue tied,</v>

59
00:02:51.651 --> 00:02:51.891
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

60
00:02:51.891 --> 00:02:52.581
<v Speaker 1>It's not good.</v>

61
00:02:52.581 --> 00:02:56.630
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to be self conscious on stage or maybe ever you get self</v>

62
00:02:56.631 --> 00:02:57.340
<v Speaker 1>conscious in the,</v>

63
00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.120
<v Speaker 1>in the face of someone you're trying to impress.</v>

64
00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.951
<v Speaker 1>He turned all red.</v>

65
00:02:59.951 --> 00:03:00.784
<v Speaker 1>You Stammer.</v>

66
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like self consciousness is a rough business and it's no wonder because you</v>

67
00:03:04.571 --> 00:03:07.870
<v Speaker 1>know yourself for the f for the fragile fool that you are,</v>

68
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.600
<v Speaker 1>and it's even worse than that because see,</v>

69
00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:14.650
<v Speaker 1>it took me a long time to figure out why it was that when Adam and eve woke up,</v>

70
00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:16.750
<v Speaker 1>they also develop the knowledge of good and evil.</v>

71
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.830
<v Speaker 1>I just couldn't figure that out because it didn't make sense to me what,</v>

72
00:03:19.831 --> 00:03:23.800
<v Speaker 1>how selfconsciousness knowledge of vulnerability and the knowledge of good and</v>

73
00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:28.150
<v Speaker 1>evil we're tangled together or even really what the knowledge of good and evil</v>

74
00:03:28.151 --> 00:03:28.984
<v Speaker 1>meant.</v>

75
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.940
<v Speaker 1>But I figured it out eventually I thought,</v>

76
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:31.211
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

77
00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:31.690
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

78
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:32.081
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

79
00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:34.510
<v Speaker 1>It was like a real revelation to me.</v>

80
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:36.910
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you know you're vulnerable,</v>

81
00:03:36.911 --> 00:03:38.560
<v Speaker 1>you know the difference between good and evil.</v>

82
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.630
<v Speaker 1>Because as soon as you know you're vulnerable,</v>

83
00:03:40.631 --> 00:03:42.100
<v Speaker 1>then you know everyone else is.</v>

84
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.740
<v Speaker 1>And as soon as you know that everyone else is vulnerable,</v>

85
00:03:44.741 --> 00:03:45.910
<v Speaker 1>you know how to hurt them.</v>

86
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.150
<v Speaker 1>And so that means you consciously know how to bring suffering into big,</v>

87
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.070
<v Speaker 1>and that's the knowledge of good and evil.</v>

88
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.280
<v Speaker 1>And you know that because let's say that you're really good at torturing people,</v>

89
00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.591
<v Speaker 1>hadn't,</v>

90
00:03:57.591 --> 00:04:00.940
<v Speaker 1>there's no doubt a number of people in the audience who are actually quite good</v>

91
00:04:00.941 --> 00:04:01.450
<v Speaker 1>at that,</v>

92
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.880
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you all have a bit of an affinity for it.</v>

93
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.233
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

94
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:06.581
<v Speaker 1>if you're married,</v>

95
00:04:06.581 --> 00:04:08.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure your partner would testify to that.</v>
