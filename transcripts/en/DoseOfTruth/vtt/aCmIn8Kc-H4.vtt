00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you remember what the article was about,</v>

2
00:00:08.621 --> 00:00:09.460
<v Speaker 1>but I wrote about,</v>

3
00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.983
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.140
<v Speaker 1>Eric Green Murray is a professor at the political science department and he was</v>

5
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.410
<v Speaker 1>forced to include,</v>

6
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:19.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.940
<v Speaker 1>Judith Butler,</v>

8
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.433
<v Speaker 1>Butler.</v>

9
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.521
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

10
00:00:22.521 --> 00:00:22.851
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

11
00:00:22.851 --> 00:00:23.750
<v Speaker 2>Chewed his butler.</v>

12
00:00:23.751 --> 00:00:23.991
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

13
00:00:23.991 --> 00:00:24.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

14
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.393
<v Speaker 1>Great,</v>

15
00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:26.240
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

16
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.541
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

17
00:00:26.541 --> 00:00:27.374
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.670
<v Speaker 1>the course is about modern society and its and its critics.</v>

19
00:00:31.671 --> 00:00:36.671
<v Speaker 1>So it's been amazing basically about the reactionary forces and a left wing</v>

20
00:00:37.611 --> 00:00:40.250
<v Speaker 1>extremist forces during the turn of the last century.</v>

21
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.320
<v Speaker 1>So in the early 20th century,</v>

22
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.810
<v Speaker 1>late 19th century.</v>

23
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.220
<v Speaker 1>And then you read Butler,</v>

24
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.633
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

25
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.720
<v Speaker 1>and actually one of the course a and not Eric,</v>

26
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:51.090
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

27
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

28
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:51.910
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

29
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:52.743
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

30
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.400
<v Speaker 1>his teaching assistant interview</v>

31
00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.380
<v Speaker 1>and she said that she disagreed with the method.</v>

32
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.220
<v Speaker 1>So she agreed with the professors that she did.</v>

33
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.290
<v Speaker 1>She thought that the academic freedom was more important than,</v>

34
00:01:06.381 --> 00:01:06.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.840
<v Speaker 1>being forced to teach about a feminist authors,</v>

36
00:01:10.841 --> 00:01:11.890
<v Speaker 1>certain gender science.</v>

37
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:12.980
<v Speaker 1>So she was actually,</v>

38
00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

39
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.413
<v Speaker 2>on the other side.</v>

40
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:15.830
<v Speaker 2>Gender Science.</v>

41
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.451
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

42
00:01:16.451 --> 00:01:16.890
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

43
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.030
<v Speaker 2>Where is by no means a scientist or even a credible academic?</v>

44
00:01:20.031 --> 00:01:21.110
<v Speaker 2>As far as I'm concerned,</v>

45
00:01:21.111 --> 00:01:24.050
<v Speaker 2>I think she's a straight out idealog and um,</v>

46
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.750
<v Speaker 2>and the fact that anybody would be forced,</v>

47
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.350
<v Speaker 2>well first of all forced to include anything on their curriculum I think is</v>

48
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.910
<v Speaker 2>absolutely reprehensible.</v>

49
00:01:31.911 --> 00:01:35.690
<v Speaker 2>It's top down interference with academic freedom and it's extraordinarily</v>

50
00:01:35.691 --> 00:01:37.790
<v Speaker 2>dangerous because once that</v>

51
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.450
<v Speaker 2>precedent is established,</v>

52
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.350
<v Speaker 2>then you opened the door for political interference in the like,</v>

53
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.340
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

54
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.570
<v Speaker 2>like organized political interference from outside the academy and it'll</v>

55
00:01:50.571 --> 00:01:52.490
<v Speaker 2>collapse very rapidly underserved.</v>

56
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.750
<v Speaker 2>We saw that happening in Germany and also in the Soviet Union and like that can</v>

57
00:01:56.751 --> 00:01:58.460
<v Speaker 2>happen so quickly that people can't,</v>

58
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.953
<v Speaker 2>can't,</v>

59
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.540
<v Speaker 2>it's almost impossible to believe.</v>

60
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.470
<v Speaker 2>Now we're in this weird situation where the same thing seems to be happening to</v>

61
00:02:07.471 --> 00:02:10.020
<v Speaker 2>a large degree within the academy itself.</v>

62
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:11.570
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

63
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.660
<v Speaker 2>and what to do about that is by no means obvious but,</v>

64
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.250
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think that allowing external control of any sort over the contents</v>

65
00:02:21.781 --> 00:02:25.200
<v Speaker 2>of the courses the professor teach professors teach is,</v>

66
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.161
<v Speaker 2>it's a very,</v>

67
00:02:26.161 --> 00:02:27.210
<v Speaker 2>very bad idea.</v>

68
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.651
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

69
00:02:28.651 --> 00:02:29.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

70
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.040
<v Speaker 1>they have a rule,</v>

71
00:02:30.041 --> 00:02:31.050
<v Speaker 1>rule of thumb,</v>

72
00:02:31.051 --> 00:02:31.501
<v Speaker 1>they call it,</v>

73
00:02:31.501 --> 00:02:32.460
<v Speaker 1>but it's basically,</v>

74
00:02:32.461 --> 00:02:33.960
<v Speaker 1>it's much more a rule,</v>

75
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.860
<v Speaker 1>the rule of thumb.</v>

76
00:02:34.861 --> 00:02:39.290
<v Speaker 1>But at least 40% of all the literature has to be written by women.</v>

77
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.780
<v Speaker 1>So if you are unbelievable,</v>

78
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.220
<v Speaker 1>if you're holding a course,</v>

79
00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:44.021
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

80
00:02:44.021 --> 00:02:45.230
<v Speaker 1>about Portland Society,</v>

81
00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:49.900
<v Speaker 1>then it's critic critics with a lot of primary literature from the turn of the</v>

82
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:50.380
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>

83
00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.810
<v Speaker 1>then you run into a problem because women weren't,</v>

84
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

85
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.040
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

86
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

87
00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.490
<v Speaker 1>there weren't a lot of women were authors back then.</v>

88
00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.330
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

89
00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.720
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

90
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.530
<v Speaker 2>he's so unbelievably,</v>

91
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.033
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

92
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.660
<v Speaker 2>I would say resentful.</v>

93
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.180
<v Speaker 2>I really think that's the fundamental issue here,</v>

94
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.590
<v Speaker 2>to push a doctor resentful and uninformed to push a doctrine like that.</v>

95
00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:11.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
