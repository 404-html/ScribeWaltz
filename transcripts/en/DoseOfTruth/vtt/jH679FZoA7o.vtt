00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.790
<v Speaker 1>Meditation.</v>

2
00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.790
<v Speaker 1>Spirituality is the key to unlock human potential.</v>

3
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.880
<v Speaker 1>It's a perfect example of how inequality emerges.</v>

4
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.500
<v Speaker 1>And we've seen this with test as well.</v>

5
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:13.771
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6
00:00:13.771 --> 00:00:17.520
<v Speaker 1>I've always wanted to build my own software company saying pretty much they cost</v>

7
00:00:17.521 --> 00:00:18.354
<v Speaker 1>autonomous.</v>

8
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.040
<v Speaker 1>It's just getting over that last little bit of do we really have the regulatory</v>

9
00:00:23.041 --> 00:00:27.600
<v Speaker 1>and the social infrastructure to support switching vehicles to autonomy.</v>

10
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.390
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's equal to begin with.</v>

11
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.740
<v Speaker 1>Everybody basically plays a random game cause monopolies basically around them</v>

12
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:35.583
<v Speaker 1>games.</v>

13
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.700
<v Speaker 1>We're instead of having huge amounts of corn,</v>

14
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.860
<v Speaker 1>soybean ground to feed all these farm animals and massive slaughter plants then</v>

15
00:00:46.861 --> 00:00:51.690
<v Speaker 1>and forums you then we'll just have basically your own localized queen meat</v>

16
00:00:51.691 --> 00:00:52.524
<v Speaker 1>production.</v>

17
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.260
<v Speaker 1>The court is written by the programmers and the artists create the visuals.</v>

18
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.860
<v Speaker 1>So what does a designer do have and designers at all?</v>

19
00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:06.270
<v Speaker 1>They started to mentally think of the player and to make that experience be as</v>

20
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.740
<v Speaker 1>enriching as possible.</v>

21
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.990
<v Speaker 1>So it's a random game.</v>

22
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.350
<v Speaker 1>So what happens when everyone starts equal and you play a random game?</v>

23
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.300
<v Speaker 1>One person ends up with everything.</v>

24
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.570
<v Speaker 1>Everyone else stacks up at zero where they sold the company just before I turned</v>

25
00:01:18.571 --> 00:01:19.404
<v Speaker 1>24.</v>

26
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>

27
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.040
<v Speaker 1>That is what I'm talking about.</v>

28
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

29
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.940
<v Speaker 1>what do you ask?</v>

30
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:26.271
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

31
00:01:26.271 --> 00:01:26.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:01:26.691 --> 00:01:27.051
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>

33
00:01:27.051 --> 00:01:28.400
<v Speaker 1>what they want to be when they grow up.</v>

34
00:01:28.401 --> 00:01:30.380
<v Speaker 1>Mine was like an inventor or like,</v>

35
00:01:30.381 --> 00:01:30.711
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:01:30.711 --> 00:01:31.860
<v Speaker 1>I want to know when to stop wearing them.</v>
