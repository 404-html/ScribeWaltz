1
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:07.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:08.720
<v Speaker 1>Now music itself,</v>

3
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:09.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:10.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean the first musical,</v>

5
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.770
<v Speaker 1>first I'd have to give you an experience that I had that allowed me to see and</v>

6
00:00:13.771 --> 00:00:14.604
<v Speaker 1>to all of us,</v>

7
00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.190
<v Speaker 1>I had already been fascinated by the gods inside of us.</v>

8
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.610
<v Speaker 1>I concluded at the age of 12 that I was an atheist and if there were no gods and</v>

9
00:00:22.611 --> 00:00:24.870
<v Speaker 1>they have an above us and know God's in the ground beneath us,</v>

10
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.901
<v Speaker 1>where were the gods?</v>

11
00:00:25.901 --> 00:00:26.051
<v Speaker 1>Will,</v>

12
00:00:26.051 --> 00:00:27.340
<v Speaker 1>my parents were trying to drive,</v>

13
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.430
<v Speaker 1>dragged me an atheist off the high holiday services and they were so intent</v>

14
00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:33.150
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>

15
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.800
<v Speaker 1>but I was literally holding onto the doorframe of their blue Fraser or by now</v>

16
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.050
<v Speaker 1>forgotten car.</v>

17
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.860
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

18
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.900
<v Speaker 1>and they were shredding my socks.</v>

19
00:00:41.901 --> 00:00:44.480
<v Speaker 1>They were quite frankly tearing my shoes off.</v>

20
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.180
<v Speaker 1>They were doing everything they could to get me up to the temple.</v>

21
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.560
<v Speaker 1>And so I realized in that moment,</v>

22
00:00:49.561 --> 00:00:51.060
<v Speaker 1>if the gods are not above with the gods,</v>

23
00:00:51.061 --> 00:00:51.571
<v Speaker 1>are not below,</v>

24
00:00:51.571 --> 00:00:52.110
<v Speaker 1>where are they?</v>

25
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.310
<v Speaker 1>They're inside my parents.</v>

26
00:00:53.311 --> 00:00:54.420
<v Speaker 1>If they're inside my parents,</v>

27
00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:56.160
<v Speaker 1>they're inside of me there inside of all of us.</v>

28
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.740
<v Speaker 1>So my task at,</v>

29
00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

30
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.430
<v Speaker 1>basically the age of 12 to 13 became use your scientific tools to find the gods</v>

31
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:05.723
<v Speaker 1>inside of us.</v>

32
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.420
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

33
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.141
<v Speaker 1>Well you also,</v>

34
00:01:07.141 --> 00:01:07.471
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

35
00:01:07.471 --> 00:01:10.950
<v Speaker 1>you elaborated on that part of the story that also made you a tune to those</v>

36
00:01:10.951 --> 00:01:13.890
<v Speaker 1>ecstatic experiences because the case that you've just laid out,</v>

37
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.900
<v Speaker 1>or I suppose we laid out together to some degree is that perhaps it was that the</v>

38
00:01:19.201 --> 00:01:23.070
<v Speaker 1>fact that you are isolated as a kid made you even more sensitive to the</v>

39
00:01:23.071 --> 00:01:28.071
<v Speaker 1>collective belonging element of music because you were so starved for it and so,</v>

40
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.490
<v Speaker 1>and then the idea of the gods within that you just laid out seems to me to be</v>

41
00:01:32.491 --> 00:01:37.491
<v Speaker 1>very much akin to what you described as either your tactic or your philosophy</v>

42
00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:40.590
<v Speaker 1>with regards to PR for the rock personalities.</v>

43
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.910
<v Speaker 1>Because what you said you were doing was trying to make them reveal some of</v>

44
00:01:44.911 --> 00:01:48.330
<v Speaker 1>these archetipal figures within and that that would,</v>

45
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.400
<v Speaker 1>and that you were actually trying to foster that,</v>

46
00:01:50.401 --> 00:01:53.130
<v Speaker 1>which meant in some sense you weren't doing PR at all.</v>

47
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.401
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

48
00:01:53.401 --> 00:01:54.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the hell you'd call it.</v>

49
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.370
<v Speaker 1>I call it secular shame.</v>

50
00:01:56.371 --> 00:01:56.710
<v Speaker 1>On us.</v>

51
00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.420
<v Speaker 1>I was a name I was never comfortable with because it's so unscientific,</v>

52
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.060
<v Speaker 1>but that was the closest I can come to it.</v>

53
00:02:03.061 --> 00:02:04.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like dowsing for the human soul.</v>

54
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

55
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.560
<v Speaker 1>it would have been a good name for a PR company.</v>

56
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.573
<v Speaker 1>A second.</v>

57
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:09.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

58
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.511
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

59
00:02:09.511 --> 00:02:09.901
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

60
00:02:09.901 --> 00:02:10.770
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a very,</v>

61
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.041
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

62
00:02:11.041 --> 00:02:15.090
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a very useful way of thinking about it because obviously one of</v>

63
00:02:15.091 --> 00:02:19.910
<v Speaker 1>the hold overs from the shamanic traditions is obviously music.</v>

64
00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.411
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

65
00:02:20.411 --> 00:02:20.921
<v Speaker 1>that's just,</v>

66
00:02:20.921 --> 00:02:23.320
<v Speaker 1>that's just a continuation of the same tradition.</v>
