1
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:06.781
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:06.781 --> 00:00:07.171
<v Speaker 1>And now,</v>

3
00:00:07.171 --> 00:00:07.441
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4
00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:07.861
<v Speaker 1>with bill,</v>

5
00:00:07.861 --> 00:00:10.560
<v Speaker 1>she's 16 and now we have motion one oh three,</v>

6
00:00:10.561 --> 00:00:15.561
<v Speaker 1>the nts homophobia bill and then the whole child and family services act has</v>

7
00:00:15.811 --> 00:00:18.540
<v Speaker 1>been now changed to a bill 89.</v>

8
00:00:18.541 --> 00:00:19.374
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

9
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.900
<v Speaker 1>basically if your child,</v>

10
00:00:21.901 --> 00:00:25.110
<v Speaker 1>if Jimmy comes home and identifies as a girl,</v>

11
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

12
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.450
<v Speaker 1>and do you kind of,</v>

13
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.871
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:00:27.871 --> 00:00:29.760
<v Speaker 1>talk them out of it or saying it in a no.</v>

15
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.630
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

16
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.610
<v Speaker 1>you could have cs at your doorstep.</v>

17
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.650
<v Speaker 1>Hold off on the puberty delay,</v>

18
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:35.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

19
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.210
<v Speaker 1>hormones there,</v>

20
00:00:36.211 --> 00:00:36.900
<v Speaker 1>Kiddo.</v>

21
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.280
<v Speaker 1>You might change your mind.</v>

22
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

23
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.590
<v Speaker 1>You could keep your breasts for a while and chased you decide that you're wrong.</v>

24
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.640
<v Speaker 1>I consider this child abuse as a form of child protection worker for eight</v>

25
00:00:47.641 --> 00:00:47.851
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

26
00:00:47.851 --> 00:00:51.510
<v Speaker 1>To me this is a flat out child abuse that's being sanctioned by the state.</v>

27
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.420
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

28
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.940
<v Speaker 1>what I'm really surprised about is that more and more parents aren't speaking</v>

29
00:00:56.941 --> 00:00:57.774
<v Speaker 1>out about this.</v>

30
00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.800
<v Speaker 1>They dropped their litter with a movement.</v>

31
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.020
<v Speaker 1>There are terrified.</v>

32
00:01:01.021 --> 00:01:02.310
<v Speaker 1>Like the teachers are terrified.</v>

33
00:01:02.311 --> 00:01:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Serena,</v>

34
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.700
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be lawsuits Galore in 15 years though,</v>

35
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.901
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

36
00:01:06.901 --> 00:01:11.010
<v Speaker 1>These kids who from whom consent is being derived,</v>

37
00:01:11.011 --> 00:01:14.250
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that there have no age to provide consent,</v>

38
00:01:14.251 --> 00:01:19.251
<v Speaker 1>are going to be a vicious legal protagonists when they go after the physicians</v>

39
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.880
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

40
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.540
<v Speaker 1>and other authorities who've made these reprehensible decisions.</v>

41
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.520
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to talk to you briefly vote the law society and about what's happening</v>

42
00:01:29.521 --> 00:01:29.881
<v Speaker 1>recently,</v>

43
00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:31.470
<v Speaker 1>the doctors and the law society.</v>

44
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:32.311
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

45
00:01:32.311 --> 00:01:36.060
<v Speaker 1>and basically the issues that you were talking with in predicting.</v>

46
00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:37.800
<v Speaker 1>Now we see them come true.</v>

47
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.890
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

48
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:39.750
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

49
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:40.643
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.310
<v Speaker 1>when the loss,</v>

51
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.310
<v Speaker 1>see I think that the Law Society of Ontario will succeed in its pushed to make a</v>

52
00:01:48.001 --> 00:01:53.001
<v Speaker 1>statement of principles reflecting social justice ideology mandatory.</v>

53
00:01:53.101 --> 00:01:54.420
<v Speaker 1>I think they're going to win that.</v>

54
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

55
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.490
<v Speaker 1>I think there will be lawyers who will refuse to write it,</v>

56
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.390
<v Speaker 1>that will take them to court and then it'll be dragged out for a long time.</v>

57
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.311
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

58
00:02:04.311 --> 00:02:05.144
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

59
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.600
<v Speaker 1>as soon as the law society capitulates are soon as the lawyers capitulate,</v>

60
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.450
<v Speaker 1>which they show virtually every sign of doing that,</v>

61
00:02:12.451 --> 00:02:15.600
<v Speaker 1>every professional organization and counted is going to follow suit.</v>

62
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you saw the agenda episode where Steve Pakan had a whole panel</v>

63
00:02:20.581 --> 00:02:21.181
<v Speaker 1>of lawyers on it.</v>

64
00:02:21.181 --> 00:02:22.170
<v Speaker 1>They were talking about this.</v>

65
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.621
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

66
00:02:22.621 --> 00:02:23.454
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see it.</v>

67
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.090
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>

68
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.301
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

69
00:02:24.301 --> 00:02:25.380
<v Speaker 1>it was actually quite recent.</v>

70
00:02:25.381 --> 00:02:26.360
<v Speaker 1>I'd say maybe the last two,</v>

71
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.761
<v Speaker 1>three weeks,</v>

72
00:02:26.761 --> 00:02:28.680
<v Speaker 1>but you should look it up and you're right.</v>

73
00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:29.640
<v Speaker 1>They have capitulated.</v>

74
00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:29.851
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

75
00:02:29.851 --> 00:02:33.410
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty obvious to me that this is where we're headed right.</v>
