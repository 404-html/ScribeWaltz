00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.400
<v Speaker 1>What advice would you give to someone looking to quit porn?</v>

2
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.260
<v Speaker 1>I gave some advice a little earlier about quitting alcohol.</v>

4
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.780
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.250
<v Speaker 1>and I would say it isn't that you're turning to quit porn.</v>

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.430
<v Speaker 1>It's not the right way to think about it.</v>

7
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.070
<v Speaker 1>The right way to think about it is that you're trying to figure out how to have</v>

8
00:00:25.071 --> 00:00:26.060
<v Speaker 1>a better life.</v>

9
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.920
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to figure out,</v>

10
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.650
<v Speaker 1>well I would say do the future authoring program and keep your porn addiction in</v>

11
00:00:33.651 --> 00:00:37.670
<v Speaker 1>mind and think so in the first part of the future authoring program,</v>

12
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.740
<v Speaker 1>it asks you a bunch of questions about what your life could be like in three to</v>

13
00:00:42.741 --> 00:00:45.830
<v Speaker 1>five years if you took care of yourself like you were someone that you cared</v>

14
00:00:45.831 --> 00:00:46.664
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

15
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.043
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

16
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.110
<v Speaker 1>and then it asks you questions about your friends and your family and your</v>

17
00:00:53.721 --> 00:00:57.470
<v Speaker 1>career and your time outside of work and your health and you know,</v>

18
00:00:57.471 --> 00:00:58.850
<v Speaker 1>the important dimensions of life.</v>

19
00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:59.270
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>

20
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.590
<v Speaker 1>it asks you to spend</v>

21
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.050
<v Speaker 1>20 minutes writing about how good your life could be in three to five years if</v>

22
00:01:06.051 --> 00:01:08.270
<v Speaker 1>you got your act together and did what was good for you.</v>

23
00:01:08.271 --> 00:01:11.090
<v Speaker 1>And then it asked you to write about the hell you could be in if you didn't.</v>

24
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.440
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say you really need to do that because porn isn't the issue.</v>

25
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.470
<v Speaker 1>The issue is that you're not living your life the way you want to.</v>

26
00:01:18.471 --> 00:01:23.270
<v Speaker 1>And so you need a vision of life that's more compelling than the porn.</v>

27
00:01:23.271 --> 00:01:25.610
<v Speaker 1>And you need a counter vision to that frightens you.</v>

28
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.631
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

29
00:01:26.631 --> 00:01:31.190
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise porn is obviously extraordinarily gratifying in the short</v>

30
00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:31.461
<v Speaker 1>term,</v>

31
00:01:31.461 --> 00:01:31.870
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

32
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.780
<v Speaker 1>but you seem to be suffering from the medium to longterm consequences of its</v>

33
00:01:35.781 --> 00:01:36.614
<v Speaker 1>use.</v>

34
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.300
<v Speaker 1>And so you need a story that you can tell yourself that's really deeply thought</v>

35
00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:44.660
<v Speaker 1>through about why this is not appropriate for you.</v>

36
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:45.591
<v Speaker 1>What's what,</v>

37
00:01:45.591 --> 00:01:49.670
<v Speaker 1>it's how it's hurting you and how it's minimizing you and perhaps making you</v>

38
00:01:49.671 --> 00:01:53.090
<v Speaker 1>embarrassed and ashamed and more socially isolated and all of that.</v>

39
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.480
<v Speaker 1>So I would say think about it as cleaning up your psyche and your behavior</v>

40
00:01:58.911 --> 00:02:00.980
<v Speaker 1>rather than merely start stopping,</v>

41
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.371
<v Speaker 1>stopping poor.</v>

42
00:02:03.371 --> 00:02:05.120
<v Speaker 1>And you also might want to write down,</v>

43
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.360
<v Speaker 1>and you could do this in a negative vision,</v>

44
00:02:08.361 --> 00:02:09.740
<v Speaker 1>part of the future authoring program.</v>

45
00:02:09.741 --> 00:02:13.110
<v Speaker 1>You got to write down everything bad that you think porn is doing to you,</v>

46
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.690
<v Speaker 1>because obviously you have some suspicions that this is not good for you,</v>

47
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:18.051
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

48
00:02:18.051 --> 00:02:18.740
<v Speaker 1>That it's,</v>

49
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.230
<v Speaker 1>that it's actually harming you in some important way.</v>

50
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.710
<v Speaker 1>And so you need to be fully cognizant of what those ways are and then take them</v>

51
00:02:27.111 --> 00:02:32.111
<v Speaker 1>seriously and decide if that's the pathway through life on which you wish to</v>

52
00:02:32.481 --> 00:02:33.880
<v Speaker 1>travel and so on.</v>

53
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.540
<v Speaker 1>Then I would also say good luck to you.</v>

54
00:02:35.541 --> 00:02:35.841
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

55
00:02:35.841 --> 00:02:36.674
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

56
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.790
<v Speaker 1>it's a very good idea to identify one of your weaknesses and work on it on you</v>

57
00:02:40.791 --> 00:02:41.120
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>

58
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.070
<v Speaker 1>you can strengthen yourself substantially by,</v>

59
00:02:43.071 --> 00:02:43.280
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
