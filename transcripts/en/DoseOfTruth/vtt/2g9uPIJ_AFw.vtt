1
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.820
<v Speaker 1>Position would be would be that,</v>

2
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:12.480
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.480
<v Speaker 1>you should try to become aware of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>totality of your subjective experience,</v>

4
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.450
<v Speaker 1>so not only do you feel it in an</v>
<v Speaker 1>embodied sense,</v>

5
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.020
<v Speaker 1>but that you represented at a that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>represented and the representation would</v>

6
00:00:27.841 --> 00:00:32.520
<v Speaker 1>be mostly in terms of articulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't clear that Roger is considered</v>

7
00:00:32.521 --> 00:00:34.380
<v Speaker 1>other forms of representation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

8
00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.790
<v Speaker 1>Roger's the movement towards health is</v>
<v Speaker 1>an integrative process and it's very</v>

9
00:00:42.871 --> 00:00:47.490
<v Speaker 1>body focused,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the outcome of that integrative</v>

10
00:00:47.491 --> 00:00:52.380
<v Speaker 1>process which Rogers would say is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to live the good life is that</v>

11
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.540
<v Speaker 1>your language is no longer instrumental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you're doing instead is attempting</v>

12
00:00:59.731 --> 00:01:04.731
<v Speaker 1>to state the truth as you see it because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course your truth is a partial truth.</v>

13
00:01:05.281 --> 00:01:07.440
<v Speaker 1>Obviously the basket you can do is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

14
00:01:07.441 --> 00:01:11.040
<v Speaker 1>I really think the best you can do is</v>
<v Speaker 1>not live if you can't tell the truth</v>

15
00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:12.500
<v Speaker 1>because you're too damn stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

16
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.110
<v Speaker 1>You don't know enough to tell the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can certainly do your best to</v>

17
00:01:16.111 --> 00:01:20.400
<v Speaker 1>represent what you know is clearly as</v>
<v Speaker 1>you possibly can in your communication</v>

18
00:01:20.401 --> 00:01:24.270
<v Speaker 1>with other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so rogers believed that it was the</v>

19
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.300
<v Speaker 1>moral responsibility of the therapist to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that personally and then to the</v>

20
00:01:30.961 --> 00:01:34.050
<v Speaker 1>degree that that was being done in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>therapy and the therapy</v>

21
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.770
<v Speaker 1>relationship in the therapeutic</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>

22
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.430
<v Speaker 1>that that in and of itself would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>healing.</v>

23
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.270
<v Speaker 1>And so basically Roger's theory is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>honest communication heels.</v>

24
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.471
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

25
00:01:49.471 --> 00:01:52.140
<v Speaker 1>that's quite an interesting theory.</v>

26
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.981
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

27
00:01:55.981 --> 00:01:58.920
<v Speaker 1>It's not completely unaligned from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud's earlier claims,</v>

28
00:01:58.921 --> 00:01:59.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because Freud</v>

29
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.600
<v Speaker 1>basically presumed that it was.</v>

30
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.730
<v Speaker 1>I didn't put so much of a moral element</v>
<v Speaker 1>on it.</v>

31
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.030
<v Speaker 1>He really viewed the person more as as</v>
<v Speaker 1>being trapped between titanic opposing</v>

32
00:02:17.401 --> 00:02:20.460
<v Speaker 1>forces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the IED underneath and the superego and</v>

33
00:02:20.461 --> 00:02:25.170
<v Speaker 1>top important illegals are crunched up</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the middle and as a consequence of</v>

34
00:02:25.171 --> 00:02:28.530
<v Speaker 1>being pulled and product and crushed by</v>
<v Speaker 1>those titanic forces,</v>

35
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.630
<v Speaker 1>pathology was likely to emerge and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about repression,</v>

36
00:02:33.631 --> 00:02:38.631
<v Speaker 1>but for tended to view repression as an</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious process for for Rogers,</v>

37
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.770
<v Speaker 1>the moral element of the therapeutic</v>
<v Speaker 1>process is much clearer,</v>

38
00:02:46.771 --> 00:02:50.040
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and most of the time when you listen to</v>

39
00:02:50.041 --> 00:02:55.041
<v Speaker 1>Rogers or you read what he had to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the injunctions that he's laying out or</v>

40
00:02:56.401 --> 00:02:57.480
<v Speaker 1>moral injunctions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

41
00:02:57.481 --> 00:03:01.450
<v Speaker 1>it's quite interesting because you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily think of psychotherapy as a</v>

42
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:06.070
<v Speaker 1>moral endeavor and I really never</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought about it that way fully until I</v>

43
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.850
<v Speaker 1>read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was reading Rogers at the same time,</v>

44
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.990
<v Speaker 1>but you don't tow weight out the</v>
<v Speaker 1>proposition in this book that most of</v>

45
00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:18.280
<v Speaker 1>the problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of the problems that people came to</v>

46
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.540
<v Speaker 1>see a therapist about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're actually moral problems and they</v>

47
00:03:22.541 --> 00:03:26.680
<v Speaker 1>were moral problems of various sorts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now sometimes the person was in trouble</v>

48
00:03:26.681 --> 00:03:28.900
<v Speaker 1>because they had done something</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously,</v>

49
00:03:28.901 --> 00:03:29.860
<v Speaker 1>seriously wrong.</v>

50
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.920
<v Speaker 1>He had one client,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>

51
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.050
<v Speaker 1>and he discovered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>

52
00:03:41.051 --> 00:03:46.000
<v Speaker 1>that she had killed her children and she</v>
<v Speaker 1>did that when they were young.</v>

53
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.480
<v Speaker 1>She had them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She let them become exposed to</v>

54
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.340
<v Speaker 1>tuberculosis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was.</v>

55
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.870
<v Speaker 1>She didn't take the proper precautions</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason she did that was because</v>

56
00:03:55.871 --> 00:03:59.650
<v Speaker 1>she wanted to marry someone and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't very interested in her children.</v>

57
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.140
<v Speaker 1>So you might consider that a moral</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem on your.</v>

58
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.110
<v Speaker 1>Apparently</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently it was weighing on her</v>

59
00:04:08.111 --> 00:04:09.130
<v Speaker 1>conscience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

60
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.220
<v Speaker 1>as it might.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well now it's a strange thing because in</v>

61
00:04:12.221 --> 00:04:16.360
<v Speaker 1>some sense what she did was turn a blind</v>
<v Speaker 1>eye to something she could have</v>

62
00:04:16.361 --> 00:04:20.170
<v Speaker 1>prevented it in legal terms that's known</v>
<v Speaker 1>as willful blindness,</v>

63
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:24.280
<v Speaker 1>but she knew whatever that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

64
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.560
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of different levels of</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing,</v>

65
00:04:26.561 --> 00:04:28.480
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can know something in your body,</v>

66
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.640
<v Speaker 1>you can know something in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>

67
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.160
<v Speaker 1>You can know something in articulated</v>
<v Speaker 1>form,</v>

68
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the whole issue of knowing is a very</v>

69
00:04:36.461 --> 00:04:41.461
<v Speaker 1>complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Rogers</v>

70
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.370
<v Speaker 1>definitely believed as far as I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell,</v>

71
00:04:47.371 --> 00:04:52.371
<v Speaker 1>that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a moral dimension to life that</v>

72
00:04:53.011 --> 00:04:55.620
<v Speaker 1>it was identifiable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That in some sense,</v>

73
00:04:55.621 --> 00:04:58.860
<v Speaker 1>it was linear that had had an observable</v>
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>

74
00:04:58.861 --> 00:05:03.090
<v Speaker 1>which was the continual integration of</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience within the phenomenal field,</v>

75
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.450
<v Speaker 1>the ironing out of contradictions within</v>
<v Speaker 1>the phenomenal field.</v>
