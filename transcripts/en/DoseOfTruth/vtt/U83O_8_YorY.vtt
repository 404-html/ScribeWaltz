1
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.010
<v Speaker 1>You could say a life without risk is hardly worth having.</v>

2
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.841
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3
00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:10.800
<v Speaker 1>it might be secure.</v>

4
00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:12.570
<v Speaker 1>Although it isn't because as I said,</v>

5
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.840
<v Speaker 1>not taking a risk also constitutes a risk.</v>

6
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:16.441
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

7
00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:17.280
<v Speaker 1>when you look back,</v>

8
00:00:17.281 --> 00:00:18.750
<v Speaker 1>people often are more</v>

9
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.980
<v Speaker 1>upset about the things they didn't do,</v>

10
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.540
<v Speaker 1>the chances they didn't take then the failures that they encountered.</v>

11
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:27.721
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

12
00:00:27.721 --> 00:00:28.351
<v Speaker 1>not always,</v>

13
00:00:28.351 --> 00:00:29.820
<v Speaker 1>obviously it depends on the failure,</v>

14
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.230
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

15
00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:35.040
<v Speaker 1>you can sit at home and Cayston Styrofoam and have your meals delivered and</v>

16
00:00:35.041 --> 00:00:35.880
<v Speaker 1>you're probably,</v>

17
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:36.743
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

18
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.030
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to get mugged probably.</v>

19
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.760
<v Speaker 1>But what's a hell of a life?</v>

20
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.830
<v Speaker 1>Psychologists have struggled for a long time to define mental health and and</v>

21
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.670
<v Speaker 1>pathology.</v>

22
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.270
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard because mental illness and even physical illness,</v>

23
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.140
<v Speaker 1>it's not simple.</v>

24
00:00:52.141 --> 00:00:52.710
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

25
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.460
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it is,</v>

26
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.290
<v Speaker 1>there's a pathogen or not.</v>

27
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.850
<v Speaker 1>Even then it's complicated cause he can't tell why the pathogen popped up at</v>

28
00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:00.420
<v Speaker 1>that point.</v>

29
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.253
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

30
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.150
<v Speaker 1>in mental health it's even more difficult.</v>

31
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.291
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

32
00:01:04.291 --> 00:01:08.430
<v Speaker 1>people have tried to define what constitutes optimal health or optimal</v>

33
00:01:08.431 --> 00:01:11.490
<v Speaker 1>performance in a system or a person in a bunch of different ways.</v>

34
00:01:11.491 --> 00:01:11.911
<v Speaker 1>You can say,</v>

35
00:01:11.911 --> 00:01:12.660
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

36
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.910
<v Speaker 1>deviation from the average is pathological,</v>

37
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.750
<v Speaker 1>but we don't think about that with talent or beauty or intelligence.</v>

38
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.160
<v Speaker 1>So as a general principle,</v>

39
00:01:20.161 --> 00:01:21.240
<v Speaker 1>that can't be right.</v>

40
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:22.643
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

41
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.070
<v Speaker 1>some people have said for mental health that assist them is unhealthy when it</v>

42
00:01:26.071 --> 00:01:28.590
<v Speaker 1>deviates from its evolutionary function.</v>

43
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.450
<v Speaker 1>Well I don't buy that because</v>

44
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.540
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to specify the evolutionary function of all sorts of things.</v>

45
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.050
<v Speaker 1>So that just doesn't solve the problem for me.</v>

46
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.990
<v Speaker 1>What seems to happen as far as I can tell is that</v>

47
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.090
<v Speaker 1>things are useful up to a certain point.</v>

48
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.380
<v Speaker 1>And once they dominate and sort of like the cyclops image with the cyclops only</v>

49
00:01:52.381 --> 00:01:53.340
<v Speaker 1>seeing one thing,</v>

50
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.970
<v Speaker 1>if you get to single minded about anything,</v>

51
00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.330
<v Speaker 1>any virtue or any behavior for that matter,</v>

52
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.230
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

53
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.110
<v Speaker 1>it hits a point where it starts to turn back on itself.</v>

54
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.310
<v Speaker 1>And then you've gone too far.</v>

55
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.050
<v Speaker 1>And when it turns back on itself,</v>

56
00:02:07.051 --> 00:02:09.750
<v Speaker 1>it hits him what's technically called a positive feedback loop.</v>

57
00:02:09.751 --> 00:02:11.820
<v Speaker 1>And then the things spirals out of control,</v>

58
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.620
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic Lee and unpredictably.</v>

59
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.450
<v Speaker 1>And I can give you some examples of that.</v>

60
00:02:15.451 --> 00:02:17.370
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you start to get depressed.</v>

61
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:18.151
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

62
00:02:18.151 --> 00:02:18.631
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

63
00:02:18.631 --> 00:02:21.960
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're slowly getting more and more depressed while there's going to be a</v>

64
00:02:21.961 --> 00:02:26.160
<v Speaker 1>tipping point or they're often as a tipping point where you're so depressed,</v>

65
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.140
<v Speaker 1>you quit going to work and you lose your job.</v>

66
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.430
<v Speaker 1>Well that's not so good for your depression because now you're not only</v>

67
00:02:32.431 --> 00:02:32.881
<v Speaker 1>depressed,</v>

68
00:02:32.881 --> 00:02:35.040
<v Speaker 1>you're unemployed and you don't have any money.</v>

69
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.611
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

70
00:02:35.611 --> 00:02:38.460
<v Speaker 1>and then maybe your know your wife is getting pretty tired of having to deal</v>

71
00:02:38.461 --> 00:02:41.070
<v Speaker 1>with you because you're depressed and now you also don't have a job and the</v>

72
00:02:41.071 --> 00:02:42.240
<v Speaker 1>stress is too much for her.</v>

73
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.490
<v Speaker 1>And so you find a lot and that makes you more depressed.</v>

74
00:02:44.491 --> 00:02:47.550
<v Speaker 1>And then you start to stay at home because you don't really want to show your</v>

75
00:02:47.551 --> 00:02:48.280
<v Speaker 1>face in public.</v>

76
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.210
<v Speaker 1>So you lose all your friends and man,</v>

77
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.073
<v Speaker 1>it's a cliff.</v>

78
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.800
<v Speaker 1>So you're,</v>

79
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.940
<v Speaker 1>you're doing not too bad.</v>

80
00:02:53.941 --> 00:02:58.941
<v Speaker 1>Even though it might be a downhill walk until you hit this like single event and</v>

81
00:02:59.411 --> 00:03:00.860
<v Speaker 1>then it just goes won't,</v>

82
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.171
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

83
00:03:02.171 --> 00:03:05.800
<v Speaker 1>because being unemployed makes you more depressed and that makes it more less</v>

84
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:08.380
<v Speaker 1>likely that you're going to look for a job and you can okay.</v>

85
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.680
<v Speaker 1>With alcoholism what seems and other forms of addiction,</v>

86
00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:16.360
<v Speaker 1>what seems to happen to me is that you hit the positive feedback loop point when</v>

87
00:03:16.361 --> 00:03:20.350
<v Speaker 1>you start using the drug to cure it's own withdrawal symptoms.</v>

88
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.120
<v Speaker 1>So you're not in trouble with cocaine until you start using it because the</v>

89
00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:26.650
<v Speaker 1>cocaine has made you feel bad.</v>

90
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.193
<v Speaker 1>And the withdrawal,</v>

91
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.260
<v Speaker 1>same with alcohol,</v>

92
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.470
<v Speaker 1>you're all shaky and you got the shakes and so on and you figured out one day</v>

93
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.760
<v Speaker 1>Jesus shot of vodka.</v>

94
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.833
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>

95
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:35.733
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

96
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:36.723
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

97
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.980
<v Speaker 1>you're firmly in that grip of the devil.</v>

98
00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:40.030
<v Speaker 1>And now at that point,</v>

99
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.730
<v Speaker 1>and I think a lot of systems are like this,</v>

100
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.870
<v Speaker 1>they worked fine but,</v>

101
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.870
<v Speaker 1>but as they get more and more exaggerated,</v>

102
00:03:46.871 --> 00:03:49.330
<v Speaker 1>they get closer and closer to a tip off point.</v>

103
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.450
<v Speaker 1>And then the tip off point is where all hell breaks loose and virtues or even</v>

104
00:03:54.491 --> 00:03:54.971
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

105
00:03:54.971 --> 00:03:55.631
<v Speaker 1>So we know,</v>

106
00:03:55.631 --> 00:03:56.261
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

107
00:03:56.261 --> 00:04:00.850
<v Speaker 1>that conscientiousness is a trait and conscientious people are industrious and</v>

108
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.450
<v Speaker 1>orderly.</v>

109
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.250
<v Speaker 1>So it's like the Protestant work ethic.</v>

110
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:04.713
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

111
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.660
<v Speaker 1>We also know that orderliness is grounded in disgust.</v>

112
00:04:07.661 --> 00:04:08.494
<v Speaker 1>Sensitivity.</v>

113
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.670
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

114
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.630
<v Speaker 1>We know that orderly people on average have better hygienic habits and they live</v>

115
00:04:13.631 --> 00:04:14.464
<v Speaker 1>longer,</v>

116
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.510
<v Speaker 1>but they're also more,</v>

117
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:17.733
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

118
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.760
<v Speaker 1>inclined to radically disapproved of homosexual behavior.</v>

119
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.970
<v Speaker 1>They're also more anti-foreigner because they have a real tight me not mean</v>

120
00:04:29.441 --> 00:04:30.550
<v Speaker 1>discrimination system,</v>

121
00:04:30.551 --> 00:04:32.530
<v Speaker 1>and they're disgusted by what's not me.</v>

122
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.741
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

123
00:04:32.741 --> 00:04:33.280
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>

124
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.240
<v Speaker 1>You don't like dirt.</v>

125
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.480
<v Speaker 1>And you can be sure that among our forefathers,</v>

126
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:38.620
<v Speaker 1>it was very frequent.</v>

127
00:04:38.621 --> 00:04:41.290
<v Speaker 1>If you are an explorer and you went out to meet a bunch of strangers,</v>

128
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.040
<v Speaker 1>you and your whole damn crew were dead three weeks later because they gave you</v>

129
00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:45.671
<v Speaker 1>some disease.</v>

130
00:04:45.671 --> 00:04:47.830
<v Speaker 1>You have no resistance to whatsoever,</v>

131
00:04:47.831 --> 00:04:49.000
<v Speaker 1>and it just wiped you out.</v>

132
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.241
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

133
00:04:49.241 --> 00:04:52.000
<v Speaker 1>that's what happened to the native Americans and the White Dove,</v>

134
00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.410
<v Speaker 1>95% of them,</v>

135
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

136
00:04:53.861 --> 00:04:54.391
<v Speaker 1>it's it,</v>

137
00:04:54.391 --> 00:04:55.720
<v Speaker 1>this is a deadly thing.</v>

138
00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:57.461
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>

139
00:04:57.461 --> 00:05:00.670
<v Speaker 1>As orderliness increases in its intensity,</v>

140
00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.090
<v Speaker 1>it starts to shade into like vicious intolerance.</v>

141
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:05.140
<v Speaker 1>So the fascists,</v>

142
00:05:05.141 --> 00:05:05.711
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

143
00:05:05.711 --> 00:05:07.840
<v Speaker 1>the Nazis were orderly.</v>

144
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.010
<v Speaker 1>They didn't like parasites and they thought of anything that wasn't just like</v>

145
00:05:12.011 --> 00:05:12.670
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

146
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:13.930
<v Speaker 1>They're corporate body.</v>

147
00:05:13.931 --> 00:05:17.050
<v Speaker 1>The areas was a parasite and it shouldn't be eradicated.</v>

148
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.990
<v Speaker 1>That's a pretty good idea when you're eradicating parasites.</v>

149
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:20.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

150
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.260
<v Speaker 1>Hitler tried to get rid of tuberculosis to begin with,</v>

151
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.330
<v Speaker 1>but then the question arises,</v>

152
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.790
<v Speaker 1>what's a parasite?</v>

153
00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.620
<v Speaker 1>At some point it's like everyone who isn't meek,</v>

154
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.871
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

155
00:05:31.871 --> 00:05:34.870
<v Speaker 1>hitting her got to that point before he died because he felt that the whole</v>

156
00:05:34.871 --> 00:05:35.950
<v Speaker 1>German society,</v>

157
00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.540
<v Speaker 1>the lost faith in the air,</v>

158
00:05:37.541 --> 00:05:41.410
<v Speaker 1>in society as the war was being lost and he was perfectly happy that the bloody</v>

159
00:05:41.411 --> 00:05:42.850
<v Speaker 1>place went up and fire,</v>

160
00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:44.530
<v Speaker 1>which is a purifying element.</v>

161
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:45.461
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

162
00:05:45.461 --> 00:05:45.671
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

163
00:05:45.671 --> 00:05:47.020
<v Speaker 1>even Lord,</v>

164
00:05:47.021 --> 00:05:49.240
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness is virtuous,</v>

165
00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.770
<v Speaker 1>but you take any virtue too far off the cliff,</v>

166
00:05:53.771 --> 00:05:54.604
<v Speaker 1>you fall.</v>

167
00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:56.223
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

168
00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.920
<v Speaker 1>so there's,</v>

169
00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.390
<v Speaker 1>there's like this range within which something works.</v>

170
00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.310
<v Speaker 1>And when you push it past that range,</v>

171
00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:05.680
<v Speaker 1>it starts to feed on itself.</v>

172
00:06:05.681 --> 00:06:07.990
<v Speaker 1>And it turns into some variant of health.</v>
