00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.510
<v Speaker 1>We could say you're trying to teach your child to talk,</v>

2
00:00:13.511 --> 00:00:16.150
<v Speaker 1>which of course you don't do what you do to a child,</v>

3
00:00:16.151 --> 00:00:16.990
<v Speaker 1>just talk to it.</v>

4
00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.950
<v Speaker 1>But it's very interesting because there have been studies of how parents talk to</v>

5
00:00:20.951 --> 00:00:25.951
<v Speaker 1>children and what they do is always use language that's slightly more complex</v>

6
00:00:26.081 --> 00:00:27.580
<v Speaker 1>than the child can understand.</v>

7
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.200
<v Speaker 1>And they do it automatically.</v>

8
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:30.580
<v Speaker 1>It's part of our,</v>

9
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.320
<v Speaker 1>what a in some sense,</v>

10
00:00:32.321 --> 00:00:34.570
<v Speaker 1>our innate knowledge structure about language.</v>

11
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.020
<v Speaker 1>So you don't only use words that the child understands,</v>

12
00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.710
<v Speaker 1>use words that they understand plus a few words and phrases and sentence</v>

13
00:00:41.711 --> 00:00:43.030
<v Speaker 1>constructions that they don't.</v>

14
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.220
<v Speaker 1>And so that's sort of pulling them along.</v>

15
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.140
<v Speaker 1>And a Russian psychologist named the Gods ski called that the zone of proximal</v>

16
00:00:50.141 --> 00:00:53.590
<v Speaker 1>development and the zone of proximal development is that place.</v>

17
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.450
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's a place in the environment where information flow into the psyche is</v>

18
00:00:58.451 --> 00:00:59.290
<v Speaker 1>maximized.</v>

19
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.550
<v Speaker 1>And that has to be.</v>

20
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.421
<v Speaker 1>So it has to be,</v>

21
00:01:01.421 --> 00:01:03.190
<v Speaker 1>cause I comprehensible,</v>

22
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.671
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:01:03.671 --> 00:01:05.410
<v Speaker 1>it's something I tried to do in my lectures.</v>

24
00:01:05.411 --> 00:01:05.681
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

25
00:01:05.681 --> 00:01:09.760
<v Speaker 1>I tried to tell you things that you know and associate them with things that you</v>

26
00:01:09.761 --> 00:01:10.271
<v Speaker 1>don't know,</v>

27
00:01:10.271 --> 00:01:12.820
<v Speaker 1>so that you're not swamped,</v>

28
00:01:12.821 --> 00:01:15.820
<v Speaker 1>hopefully by an excess of incomprehensible information,</v>

29
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.841
<v Speaker 1>but you don't think,</v>

30
00:01:16.841 --> 00:01:17.381
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

31
00:01:17.381 --> 00:01:18.191
<v Speaker 1>he's saying that again.</v>

32
00:01:18.191 --> 00:01:19.150
<v Speaker 1>I already know that,</v>

33
00:01:19.151 --> 00:01:19.451
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:01:19.451 --> 00:01:19.861
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

35
00:01:19.861 --> 00:01:20.680
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

36
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.513
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

37
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.810
<v Speaker 1>anything that's dramatic instructure is doing that for you.</v>

38
00:01:24.811 --> 00:01:25.330
<v Speaker 1>It's keeping them,</v>

39
00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.250
<v Speaker 1>it's keeping you on the edge of attention.</v>

40
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.960
<v Speaker 1>And that place is where your adaptation is maximized.</v>

41
00:01:31.961 --> 00:01:36.490
<v Speaker 1>Because not only are you firming up the structure that's underneath your feet,</v>

42
00:01:36.491 --> 00:01:38.110
<v Speaker 1>you're relying on it and you know,</v>

43
00:01:38.111 --> 00:01:38.321
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

44
00:01:38.321 --> 00:01:40.360
<v Speaker 1>it's part of the platform on which you stand,</v>

45
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.160
<v Speaker 1>but you're absorbing information at a rate that allows you to increase the</v>

46
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.220
<v Speaker 1>solidity and area of that solid ground without undermining you so much that it</v>

47
00:01:52.001 --> 00:01:53.320
<v Speaker 1>falls apart beneath you.</v>

48
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.300
<v Speaker 1>So it's lovely.</v>

49
00:01:55.301 --> 00:01:59.050
<v Speaker 1>It's such a good idea because think about what it would mean if it was true.</v>

50
00:01:59.051 --> 00:02:03.880
<v Speaker 1>It would mean that if you pay attention to what captures your interest and you</v>

51
00:02:03.881 --> 00:02:04.840
<v Speaker 1>follow that,</v>

52
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.480
<v Speaker 1>that means you're going to always be interested in what you're doing.</v>

53
00:02:07.481 --> 00:02:08.620
<v Speaker 1>But even better than that,</v>

54
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.520
<v Speaker 1>it's going to mean that you're going to maximize your adaptive capacity as much</v>

55
00:02:12.521 --> 00:02:15.220
<v Speaker 1>as possible at exactly the same time,</v>

56
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.941
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

57
00:02:15.941 --> 00:02:18.250
<v Speaker 1>that'd be a great deal if it actually happened to be true.</v>

58
00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.280
<v Speaker 1>Now it's a bit complicated because what culture wants from you and what is</v>

59
00:02:24.371 --> 00:02:26.260
<v Speaker 1>intrinsically interesting to you,</v>

60
00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.850
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be a conflict there,</v>

61
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:28.181
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

62
00:02:28.181 --> 00:02:32.230
<v Speaker 1>Because culture wants you to do what a good cultural entity should do,</v>

63
00:02:32.231 --> 00:02:34.000
<v Speaker 1>which is to do what you're told to do,</v>

64
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:35.800
<v Speaker 1>but you're not,</v>

65
00:02:35.801 --> 00:02:36.041
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

66
00:02:36.041 --> 00:02:37.120
<v Speaker 1>you're not a robot.</v>

67
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.170
<v Speaker 1>And so part of the existential problem that you have in life is trying to figure</v>

68
00:02:41.171 --> 00:02:46.171
<v Speaker 1>out some compromise between what you find personally engaging and that develops</v>

69
00:02:47.471 --> 00:02:51.190
<v Speaker 1>and supports you and what the culture will provide,</v>

70
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.313
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

71
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.520
<v Speaker 1>resources to you for pursuing.</v>

72
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:55.960
<v Speaker 1>And it's hard.</v>

73
00:02:55.961 --> 00:02:57.250
<v Speaker 1>There's no simple answer to it.</v>

74
00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.610
<v Speaker 1>But I say that if you sacrifice your,</v>

75
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.040
<v Speaker 1>your capacity to engage in meaningful activity to the security of a given</v>

76
00:03:08.261 --> 00:03:09.820
<v Speaker 1>position and a dominance hierarchy,</v>

77
00:03:09.821 --> 00:03:11.890
<v Speaker 1>then you turn into something that's like a soul,</v>

78
00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:12.730
<v Speaker 1>a slave.</v>

79
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.930
<v Speaker 1>And that's a really bad idea because there's no way you can do that for any</v>

80
00:03:16.931 --> 00:03:19.510
<v Speaker 1>length of time without getting bored and resentful.</v>

81
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.610
<v Speaker 1>And once your board and resentful,</v>

82
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.310
<v Speaker 1>the move from that to dangerous is a very,</v>

83
00:03:24.311 --> 00:03:25.630
<v Speaker 1>very small step.</v>

84
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.070
<v Speaker 1>So it's hard and it isn't even necessarily the case that you're going to make</v>

85
00:03:30.071 --> 00:03:30.970
<v Speaker 1>the balance.</v>

86
00:03:30.971 --> 00:03:32.290
<v Speaker 1>You know you're going to mail to manage it,</v>

87
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:33.730
<v Speaker 1>but if you don't,</v>

88
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.740
<v Speaker 1>you're going to pay a massive price for it.</v>

89
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.000
<v Speaker 1>So I would say,</v>

90
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

91
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:38.171
<v Speaker 1>let,</v>

92
00:03:38.171 --> 00:03:42.280
<v Speaker 1>don't let people mess around with what you find compelling any more than is</v>

93
00:03:42.281 --> 00:03:43.660
<v Speaker 1>absolutely necessary.</v>

94
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.710
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

95
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.710
<v Speaker 1>so because it's very dangerous to do that,</v>

96
00:03:47.711 --> 00:03:48.970
<v Speaker 1>it's very dangerous to do that.</v>

97
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.630
<v Speaker 1>Just like it's dangerous not to find a position in the dominance hierarchy at</v>

98
00:03:52.631 --> 00:03:55.570
<v Speaker 1>all because then you end up in a chaotic place.</v>

99
00:03:55.571 --> 00:03:57.350
<v Speaker 1>And my experience being you,</v>

100
00:03:57.351 --> 00:03:58.480
<v Speaker 1>you might wonder about this,</v>

101
00:03:58.481 --> 00:04:02.590
<v Speaker 1>it's like what's the probability that someone can live a healthy life,</v>

102
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:03.431
<v Speaker 1>healthy,</v>

103
00:04:03.431 --> 00:04:04.001
<v Speaker 1>productive,</v>

104
00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:06.970
<v Speaker 1>and stable life outside of dominance hierarchy.</v>

105
00:04:06.971 --> 00:04:08.530
<v Speaker 1>So without external structure.</v>

106
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.000
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is there might be one person in this class that could do</v>

107
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:13.480
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

108
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.530
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard because what happens to most people is that if they don't have</v>

109
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:21.040
<v Speaker 1>a substantial amount of external structure and routine,</v>

110
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.420
<v Speaker 1>they just fall apart.</v>

111
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.070
<v Speaker 1>They don't sleep properly,</v>

112
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.450
<v Speaker 1>they don't eat properly,</v>

113
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:25.931
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

114
00:04:25.931 --> 00:04:26.890
<v Speaker 1>they're depressed.</v>

115
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.570
<v Speaker 1>It's tremendously effortful to continually reinvent yourself day after day.</v>

116
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:32.920
<v Speaker 1>And so there's some real,</v>

117
00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.060
<v Speaker 1>there's some real utility in routine and social identity,</v>

118
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.631
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

119
00:04:37.631 --> 00:04:42.340
<v Speaker 1>and young would say the part of you that has adapted to re routine and social</v>

120
00:04:42.341 --> 00:04:47.050
<v Speaker 1>identity is the persona and sort of the mask you wear in public and might even</v>

121
00:04:47.051 --> 00:04:48.310
<v Speaker 1>be who you think you are.</v>

122
00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.040
<v Speaker 1>And he thought that people who were only persona,</v>

123
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.870
<v Speaker 1>we're dangerous because they were only thoughtless advocates of the system for</v>

124
00:04:55.871 --> 00:04:57.040
<v Speaker 1>which they stood.</v>

125
00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.240
<v Speaker 1>But he also believed that PR people who had no persona where in an equally</v>

126
00:05:01.241 --> 00:05:06.040
<v Speaker 1>terrible situation because they're psychologically chaotic and they don't have a</v>

127
00:05:06.041 --> 00:05:10.570
<v Speaker 1>social structure around them to hem them in and continually remind them how to</v>

128
00:05:10.571 --> 00:05:11.920
<v Speaker 1>be sane and productive.</v>

129
00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:13.870
<v Speaker 1>So it's a matter of balance.</v>

130
00:05:13.871 --> 00:05:14.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

131
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.800
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

132
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.000
<v Speaker 1>there's horrors on both sides and there's advantages on both sides.</v>

133
00:05:19.001 --> 00:05:23.650
<v Speaker 1>And the trick is to place yourself in a location where you're deriving maximum</v>

134
00:05:23.651 --> 00:05:24.910
<v Speaker 1>advantage from both.</v>

135
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.470
<v Speaker 1>And you'll be able to tell if you do that.</v>

136
00:05:26.471 --> 00:05:27.820
<v Speaker 1>Because if you are doing that,</v>

137
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.480
<v Speaker 1>you're going to find your life engaging and meaningful enough.</v>

138
00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.370
<v Speaker 1>So the fact that it's also tragic and potentially composed at least partially of</v>

139
00:05:36.371 --> 00:05:37.204
<v Speaker 1>slavery,</v>

140
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.860
<v Speaker 1>is going to be acceptable.</v>

141
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:40.121
<v Speaker 1>And that's what,</v>

142
00:05:40.121 --> 00:05:41.710
<v Speaker 1>that's the goal in some sense.</v>

143
00:05:41.711 --> 00:05:42.730
<v Speaker 1>It's a hard to do that,</v>

144
00:05:42.731 --> 00:05:43.750
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

145
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.280
<v Speaker 1>it's hard not to do it too.</v>

146
00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.960
<v Speaker 1>So you're screwed either way.</v>

147
00:05:46.961 --> 00:05:50.530
<v Speaker 1>So you might as well pick the path that's going to be of maximum utility to you.</v>
