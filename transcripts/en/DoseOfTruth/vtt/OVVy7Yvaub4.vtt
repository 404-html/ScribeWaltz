1
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.710
<v Speaker 1>How long before you do a video conversation with Kanye West?</v>

2
00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.013
<v Speaker 2>Mm.</v>

3
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:20.603
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:27.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean the whole,</v>

5
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what to say about</v>

6
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:32.760
<v Speaker 1>Candice Olin's.</v>

7
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:33.540
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

8
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.650
<v Speaker 1>And Chinese west.</v>

9
00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just observe.</v>

10
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.950
<v Speaker 1>So we'll see.</v>

11
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.290
<v Speaker 1>We'll see what happens when the sun on the 25th we'll be listening to your</v>

12
00:00:46.371 --> 00:00:46.920
<v Speaker 1>lectures.</v>

13
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.730
<v Speaker 1>What's your advice for balancing Charles?</v>

14
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:51.453
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

15
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.730
<v Speaker 1>there is a charter and rule 12 call,</v>

16
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.960
<v Speaker 1>which is short at chapter 12 which is rule number nine.</v>

17
00:00:59.961 --> 00:01:04.490
<v Speaker 1>Rule is assumed that the person listening to deal with something you don't.</v>

18
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:05.001
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

19
00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:07.250
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to tell you a story about marriage.</v>

20
00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.510
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

21
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:09.160
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

22
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.160
<v Speaker 1>this is kind of cool.</v>

23
00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.780
<v Speaker 1>So I had this friend,</v>

24
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.260
<v Speaker 1>his name is flow Carlstrom.</v>

25
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.960
<v Speaker 1>He went to Sweden to get Eric because he was Swedish Fish,</v>

26
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.200
<v Speaker 1>Canadian and uh,</v>

27
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.890
<v Speaker 1>and the marriage ceremony,</v>

28
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.100
<v Speaker 1>the couple have all the candle.</v>

29
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.930
<v Speaker 1>You're taking your boss.</v>

30
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.210
<v Speaker 1>And that was very interesting to me.</v>

31
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:34.603
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

32
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.860
<v Speaker 1>in the Christian symbolic world,</v>

33
00:01:37.861 --> 00:01:38.694
<v Speaker 1>marriages,</v>

34
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.630
<v Speaker 1>which feature of something sick,</v>

35
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.850
<v Speaker 1>which means it's something axiomatic and fundamental and not to be messed with</v>

36
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.593
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

37
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.931
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

38
00:01:46.931 --> 00:01:48.140
<v Speaker 1>That's what you assume when you take,</v>

39
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.440
<v Speaker 1>you're going to make this a foundation that you don't shake.</v>

40
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:54.970
<v Speaker 1>Who found again with that,</v>

41
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.030
<v Speaker 1>can you kind of stay in your cell phone and what kind of,</v>

42
00:01:58.031 --> 00:01:59.180
<v Speaker 1>you're absolutely state.</v>

43
00:01:59.181 --> 00:02:00.090
<v Speaker 1>Can you yourself on it.</v>

44
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:01.780
<v Speaker 1>One of the things about that,</v>

45
00:02:01.781 --> 00:02:05.290
<v Speaker 1>and this is worth knowing perhaps especially to the people in this audience who</v>

46
00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:06.280
<v Speaker 1>haven't been married yet,</v>

47
00:02:06.281 --> 00:02:08.180
<v Speaker 1>but maybe to those of you who are already here,</v>

48
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.230
<v Speaker 1>there's an idea that means that your marriage to Kennel work,</v>

49
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.520
<v Speaker 1>unless you're all in.</v>

50
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.150
<v Speaker 1>That's why there is he bald at the same monogamous we're calling them,</v>

51
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.980
<v Speaker 1>run the world by.</v>

52
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.510
<v Speaker 1>He aren't really to the society,</v>

53
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.560
<v Speaker 1>but they tend to be very unstable for all sorts of complicated reasons.</v>

54
00:02:25.561 --> 00:02:29.730
<v Speaker 1>So there's a strong proclivity toward social reinforcement autonomy among human</v>

55
00:02:29.731 --> 00:02:34.731
<v Speaker 1>beings and there's a strong arm liberty to make it in environment.</v>

56
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.170
<v Speaker 1>There's a psychological reason for that,</v>

57
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.530
<v Speaker 1>which is that you are not going to be committed enough to your partner to take</v>

58
00:02:40.531 --> 00:02:42.630
<v Speaker 1>care of them unless you bloody well know.</v>

59
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.230
<v Speaker 1>You want to shout him them that you are shocking to the escape</v>

60
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.590
<v Speaker 1>because why are when you look how you're not going to be serious enough about it</v>

61
00:02:51.591 --> 00:02:52.191
<v Speaker 1>so I can really,</v>

62
00:02:52.191 --> 00:02:54.500
<v Speaker 1>I have to put up with you for like 50 years.</v>

63
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.490
<v Speaker 1>We better get our our house in order because otherwise it's going to be some</v>

64
00:02:58.491 --> 00:02:59.320
<v Speaker 1>slice of,</v>

65
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.380
<v Speaker 1>because you're just a screwed up in horrible as me.</v>

66
00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.153
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

67
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.830
<v Speaker 1>so that's something that's very,</v>

68
00:03:05.831 --> 00:03:09.670
<v Speaker 1>very serious and so with your partner has a problem or if you have a problem,</v>

69
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.150
<v Speaker 1>you want to solve that because otherwise you're going to have it maybe every day</v>

70
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:14.110
<v Speaker 1>for the rest of your life.</v>

71
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.093
<v Speaker 1>And you might've made,</v>

72
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.620
<v Speaker 1>because I could run away and find someone else.</v>

73
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.921
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

74
00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:21.340
<v Speaker 1>well good luck with that because they're going to come with just as many flaws</v>

75
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.830
<v Speaker 1>probably as you have probably as department as,</v>

76
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.710
<v Speaker 1>and you're going to bring all your insecurities and the vcs into the new</v>

77
00:03:27.711 --> 00:03:28.680
<v Speaker 1>relationship anyway.</v>

78
00:03:28.681 --> 00:03:30.370
<v Speaker 1>So unless you want to be alone,</v>

79
00:03:30.371 --> 00:03:31.360
<v Speaker 1>which is no picnic,</v>

80
00:03:31.361 --> 00:03:34.480
<v Speaker 1>and generally a fairly quick route to the kind of insanity,</v>

81
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.810
<v Speaker 1>then you're pretty much stuck with the fact that you have flaws anyway.</v>

82
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.380
<v Speaker 1>So they're standing there with this candidate.</v>

83
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.260
<v Speaker 1>Here's the ideal,</v>

84
00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:44.520
<v Speaker 1>same ideas,</v>

85
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:45.790
<v Speaker 1>Cannibal Christmas,</v>

86
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.080
<v Speaker 1>it's a complicated idea or something you,</v>

87
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.180
<v Speaker 1>most of you act out,</v>

88
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.430
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have lights in the darkness of the winter.</v>

89
00:03:52.431 --> 00:03:54.940
<v Speaker 1>You bring the tree inside is what the hell are you up to?</v>

90
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:56.590
<v Speaker 1>And you don't know going to do it anyways</v>

91
00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.510
<v Speaker 1>because of the course.</v>

92
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.300
<v Speaker 1>What do you want to do when you bring a tree lights in?</v>

93
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.150
<v Speaker 1>It stands to reason,</v>

94
00:04:04.151 --> 00:04:04.491
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

95
00:04:04.491 --> 00:04:08.200
<v Speaker 1>And what does the Y to symbolize?</v>

96
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.110
<v Speaker 1>Illumination.</v>

97
00:04:09.111 --> 00:04:09.944
<v Speaker 1>Darks.</v>

98
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.580
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

99
00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.890
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

100
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:11.440
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

101
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.580
<v Speaker 1>it's a pagan ritual,</v>

102
00:04:12.581 --> 00:04:13.930
<v Speaker 1>but it's been Christian honesty.</v>

103
00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.220
<v Speaker 1>You put out an angel perhaps at the top of the tree to signify that which is at</v>

104
00:04:18.221 --> 00:04:22.950
<v Speaker 1>the top of things and you celebrate the reemergence of the light to the dark</v>

105
00:04:22.951 --> 00:04:23.131
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>

106
00:04:23.131 --> 00:04:24.820
<v Speaker 1>So it's a little ritual.</v>

107
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.180
<v Speaker 1>It's eight gap laying out in the world in terms of good and evil,</v>

108
00:04:28.181 --> 00:04:30.130
<v Speaker 1>with light being good darkness,</v>

109
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.993
<v Speaker 1>feed evil.</v>

110
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.570
<v Speaker 1>And it's a good thing to do in the winter because it's dark and you're also</v>

111
00:04:34.571 --> 00:04:36.150
<v Speaker 1>celebrating the birth of the song.</v>

112
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.031
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

113
00:04:37.031 --> 00:04:37.864
<v Speaker 1>very complicated.</v>

114
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:39.310
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

115
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.910
<v Speaker 1>and then the capital and the trees assignment in the nation and vision and like</v>

116
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:45.310
<v Speaker 1>it's a Christmas tree.</v>

117
00:04:45.311 --> 00:04:48.850
<v Speaker 1>So it's associated with the idea of the birth of the mythological hero or the</v>

118
00:04:48.851 --> 00:04:52.390
<v Speaker 1>messiah that's crest until you're doing all that at the same time.</v>

119
00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:53.510
<v Speaker 1>Now celebration,</v>

120
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.420
<v Speaker 1>because it's a great thing,</v>

121
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:56.970
<v Speaker 1>a new hero inches the world.</v>

122
00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.090
<v Speaker 1>That's what happened to a child the child has,</v>

123
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.610
<v Speaker 1>is a locus of divine consciousness is,</v>

124
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.580
<v Speaker 1>is threatened at birth.</v>

125
00:05:06.581 --> 00:05:08.350
<v Speaker 1>Like the mythological hero wall was his,</v>

126
00:05:08.351 --> 00:05:10.570
<v Speaker 1>because he's smaller and trout trout,</v>

127
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.690
<v Speaker 1>if not hopefully goes up to do great things.</v>

128
00:05:13.691 --> 00:05:15.520
<v Speaker 1>And so that's all tangled up in that.</v>

129
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.470
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

130
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.420
<v Speaker 1>the capital is a symbol of the light in the world and the light in the world is</v>

131
00:05:22.421 --> 00:05:23.740
<v Speaker 1>the mythological hero.</v>

132
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.360
<v Speaker 1>It's Christ in the Christian drama.</v>

133
00:05:25.361 --> 00:05:26.710
<v Speaker 1>So we'll use that.</v>

134
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.580
<v Speaker 1>So you hold the camera above your head when you're getting married to symbolize</v>

135
00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.740
<v Speaker 1>what you are subordinate to.</v>

136
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:34.181
<v Speaker 1>Because you might say,</v>

137
00:05:34.181 --> 00:05:34.901
<v Speaker 1>well in the marriage,</v>

138
00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:36.790
<v Speaker 1>well the wife or the husband,</v>

139
00:05:36.791 --> 00:05:40.930
<v Speaker 1>that's the claim that's put out by those who think that marriage is a</v>

140
00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:41.540
<v Speaker 1>patriarchal,</v>

141
00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.210
<v Speaker 1>oppressive institution,</v>

142
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.680
<v Speaker 1>which it is by the way,</v>

143
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:45.461
<v Speaker 1>which you know,</v>

144
00:05:45.461 --> 00:05:49.210
<v Speaker 1>because we will need people who get married now aren't rich people and rich</v>

145
00:05:49.211 --> 00:05:52.840
<v Speaker 1>people don't oppress themselves as far as we know.</v>

146
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.320
<v Speaker 1>What if you look at the demographics as marriage has disintegrated,</v>

147
00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.450
<v Speaker 1>it's disintegrated from the lower socio economic classes.</v>

148
00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.070
<v Speaker 1>And so unless you can come up with a reason for why rich privileged people would</v>

149
00:06:04.071 --> 00:06:05.000
<v Speaker 1>impress themselves,</v>

150
00:06:05.001 --> 00:06:08.480
<v Speaker 1>then the whole notion that marriage is no oppressive patriarchal structure is</v>

151
00:06:08.481 --> 00:06:09.900
<v Speaker 1>pretty much the gist fruit.</v>

152
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:11.000
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

153
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.610
<v Speaker 1>so we'll say,</v>

154
00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:11.990
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

155
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.530
<v Speaker 1>Wireshark support it to their husbands,</v>

156
00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:14.311
<v Speaker 1>but we also say,</v>

157
00:06:14.311 --> 00:06:15.020
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

158
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.780
<v Speaker 1>husbands are subordinate to their wipes as well.</v>

159
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:18.890
<v Speaker 1>And Fair enough.</v>

160
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:19.301
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

161
00:06:19.301 --> 00:06:22.820
<v Speaker 1>so what is it that the couple of his subordinate too,</v>

162
00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.420
<v Speaker 1>and their history is what symbolized by the light.</v>

163
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.460
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means?</v>

164
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:28.880
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

165
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.080
<v Speaker 1>there's an old idea.</v>

166
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.310
<v Speaker 1>It's a very symbolic and a weird idea that Christ was androgynous and</v>

167
00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:35.900
<v Speaker 1>combination of male and female,</v>

168
00:06:35.901 --> 00:06:40.220
<v Speaker 1>he was a reconstruction of the original Abbott who was male and female before he</v>

169
00:06:40.221 --> 00:06:41.090
<v Speaker 1>was old apart.</v>

170
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.200
<v Speaker 1>This is a dream.</v>

171
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:43.550
<v Speaker 1>It's a cultural dream.</v>

172
00:06:43.551 --> 00:06:45.630
<v Speaker 1>So Christ is the property.</v>

173
00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.270
<v Speaker 1>You need a masculine and feminine.</v>

174
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.340
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what the marriage is.</v>

175
00:06:49.341 --> 00:06:51.500
<v Speaker 1>Just a property be masculine and feminine.</v>

176
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.420
<v Speaker 1>And the people in the marriage,</v>

177
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.180
<v Speaker 1>the husband and the wife are supposed to be subordinate to the ideal you of</v>

178
00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:58.400
<v Speaker 1>masculine and feminine.</v>

179
00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:03.910
<v Speaker 1>And what that I and union is that spirit that's created by proper and truthful</v>

180
00:07:04.011 --> 00:07:04.550
<v Speaker 1>debate,</v>

181
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:05.383
<v Speaker 1>dialogue.</v>

182
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:06.810
<v Speaker 1>So what do you do if you,</v>

183
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:07.850
<v Speaker 1>if you're married to someone,</v>

184
00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.120
<v Speaker 1>we have to contend with them and they have to contend with you.</v>

185
00:07:11.121 --> 00:07:13.430
<v Speaker 1>And that's a real bad if you're actually communicated,</v>

186
00:07:13.431 --> 00:07:16.250
<v Speaker 1>cause you're not saying you have different personalities,</v>

187
00:07:16.251 --> 00:07:17.270
<v Speaker 1>you have different values,</v>

188
00:07:17.271 --> 00:07:18.170
<v Speaker 1>you have different age,</v>

189
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.810
<v Speaker 1>your different sections like you're different.</v>

190
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:25.610
<v Speaker 1>And that if you can incorporate them difference in both of you can incorporate</v>

191
00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:26.091
<v Speaker 1>that difference.</v>

192
00:07:26.091 --> 00:07:30.590
<v Speaker 1>Can you both why went out and you're a full of flaws and their partners full of</v>

193
00:07:30.591 --> 00:07:30.921
<v Speaker 1>flaws,</v>

194
00:07:30.921 --> 00:07:33.110
<v Speaker 1>but he knows something you don't and you know something,</v>

195
00:07:33.111 --> 00:07:33.800
<v Speaker 1>he does it.</v>

196
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.010
<v Speaker 1>So if you can start that information exchanged,</v>

197
00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:36.800
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

198
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.660
<v Speaker 1>that Turkle dialogue in both of you can be transformed in the course of the</v>

199
00:07:41.661 --> 00:07:44.330
<v Speaker 1>August speech that constitutes the relationship,</v>

200
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.920
<v Speaker 1>the negotiation,</v>

201
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:47.450
<v Speaker 1>and what you're supposed to do.</v>

202
00:07:47.451 --> 00:07:51.140
<v Speaker 1>And this is what symbolized by the candle is both subordinate yourself to that</v>

203
00:07:51.141 --> 00:07:52.670
<v Speaker 1>ongoing negotiation.</v>

204
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:53.541
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

205
00:07:53.541 --> 00:07:56.450
<v Speaker 1>one thing you don't want to do is you don't want to beat your wife eat an</v>

206
00:07:56.451 --> 00:07:58.290
<v Speaker 1>argument even though you really watch it.</v>

207
00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:01.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean you absolutely want to and you're going to act that out too.</v>

208
00:08:01.131 --> 00:08:02.900
<v Speaker 1>And she's going to do the same thing to you.</v>

209
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:06.920
<v Speaker 1>It's just not that helpful because you have to live with her tomorrow.</v>

210
00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:09.680
<v Speaker 1>And so if you defeat her in an argument,</v>

211
00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:10.790
<v Speaker 1>well here's the options.</v>

212
00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:11.241
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>

213
00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:13.760
<v Speaker 1>she was right and you're wrong and you just argued better.</v>

214
00:08:13.761 --> 00:08:16.070
<v Speaker 1>And so what the hell is that?</v>

215
00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.150
<v Speaker 1>She's right.</v>

216
00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:21.170
<v Speaker 1>You haven't solved the problem or you were writing and meter good,</v>

217
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.570
<v Speaker 1>then she's like beaten.</v>

218
00:08:22.571 --> 00:08:26.390
<v Speaker 1>And not very happy about it is going to do the same thing to you as soon as the</v>

219
00:08:26.391 --> 00:08:27.620
<v Speaker 1>opportunity arises.</v>

220
00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.600
<v Speaker 1>That's not very helpful.</v>

221
00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:30.650
<v Speaker 1>So what do you want to do?</v>

222
00:08:30.651 --> 00:08:32.720
<v Speaker 1>And you want to find out what the hell the problem is,</v>

223
00:08:32.721 --> 00:08:36.290
<v Speaker 1>which is really painful and horrible thing to do because people sometimes don't</v>

224
00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:39.530
<v Speaker 1>even know what the problem is and then you have to listen to them like for three</v>

225
00:08:39.531 --> 00:08:43.850
<v Speaker 1>days to clinic play without trying to tell him what's wrong cause they don't</v>

226
00:08:43.851 --> 00:08:45.490
<v Speaker 1>know and you have to be shut out.</v>

227
00:08:45.491 --> 00:08:49.430
<v Speaker 1>The non offers solutions too early because otherwise they can't go to the</v>

228
00:08:49.431 --> 00:08:51.710
<v Speaker 1>painful process of figuring out what the problem is.</v>

229
00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:54.970
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's some problem they have with their father mistreated.</v>

230
00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:57.450
<v Speaker 1>Your mother been like 1975</v>

231
00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:04.240
<v Speaker 1>if you listen,</v>

232
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.720
<v Speaker 1>knowing that if you solved the problem,</v>

233
00:09:06.721 --> 00:09:08.610
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to have it again.</v>

234
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:13.440
<v Speaker 1>Then if you could get that negotiated dialogue going continually and that's what</v>

235
00:09:13.441 --> 00:09:14.970
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to be subordinate to.</v>

236
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:17.340
<v Speaker 1>And so then to answer this question,</v>

237
00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:19.650
<v Speaker 1>which is to me here,</v>

238
00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:27.450
<v Speaker 1>my wife and I were expecting some of the 25th what is your advice on balancing</v>

239
00:09:27.451 --> 00:09:28.890
<v Speaker 1>childcare heritage in the business?</v>

240
00:09:28.891 --> 00:09:29.251
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

241
00:09:29.251 --> 00:09:31.140
<v Speaker 1>well my advice is</v>

242
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:39.230
<v Speaker 1>stick to your damage bout so you can't run away and then you with your wife</v>

243
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:44.580
<v Speaker 1>because the two of you having two brains rather than one would probably be able</v>

244
00:09:44.581 --> 00:09:46.900
<v Speaker 1>to figure out how to do this as you go.</v>

245
00:09:46.901 --> 00:09:48.600
<v Speaker 1>If you actually talk to each other.</v>

246
00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.010
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the utility free speech.</v>

247
00:09:51.011 --> 00:09:56.011
<v Speaker 1>But so you get to think out loud and if there's someone else around you is also</v>

248
00:09:56.401 --> 00:10:00.960
<v Speaker 1>thinking and whose life is at twined with yours and you both aiming for what's</v>

249
00:10:00.961 --> 00:10:01.650
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

250
00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:04.710
<v Speaker 1>then between the might be able to get the process going.</v>

251
00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:05.460
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>

252
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:07.560
<v Speaker 1>that's the exchange of the logos,</v>

253
00:10:07.561 --> 00:10:08.310
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

254
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:12.930
<v Speaker 1>That will enable you to overcome the problems of life and then maybe having done</v>

255
00:10:12.931 --> 00:10:16.920
<v Speaker 1>that and make yourselves into a unit reasonably intelligent,</v>

256
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:17.750
<v Speaker 1>wise,</v>

257
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:19.260
<v Speaker 1>it's also capable of learning.</v>

258
00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:22.580
<v Speaker 1>And then when your child and how does that unit,</v>

259
00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:24.480
<v Speaker 1>they'll be a nice wall around,</v>

260
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:25.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

261
00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.370
<v Speaker 1>you know what it's like because they're,</v>

262
00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:27.811
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

263
00:10:27.811 --> 00:10:31.950
<v Speaker 1>they're pushing the primates and they'll get everything they can in the wall.</v>

264
00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:34.980
<v Speaker 1>They'll just purchasing the torture torches and see if he's a weakness</v>

265
00:10:34.981 --> 00:10:35.520
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.</v>

266
00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.530
<v Speaker 1>Cause they want to know.</v>

267
00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:38.760
<v Speaker 1>And if they could set you against your wife,</v>

268
00:10:38.761 --> 00:10:40.290
<v Speaker 1>they will absolutely do that.</v>

269
00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:41.340
<v Speaker 1>But if you,</v>

270
00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:42.350
<v Speaker 1>because why wouldn't pay?</v>

271
00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.040
<v Speaker 1>Because they want to see what's real.</v>

272
00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:45.210
<v Speaker 1>They're not messing around.</v>

273
00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:46.650
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to live right.</v>

274
00:10:46.651 --> 00:10:49.350
<v Speaker 1>And they want to see what they're going to push the boundaries.</v>

275
00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:54.270
<v Speaker 1>And if you have a solid relationship and the kid comes up and pushes against</v>

276
00:10:54.271 --> 00:10:54.451
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

277
00:10:54.451 --> 00:10:55.170
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

278
00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:58.060
<v Speaker 1>you know how when we were talking about some of that to walk once or twice and</v>

279
00:10:58.061 --> 00:11:01.610
<v Speaker 1>stand up underneath the table needs to short snap a good one.</v>

280
00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.490
<v Speaker 1>But because of the table never changes shape,</v>

281
00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.950
<v Speaker 1>he'll only do that twice.</v>

282
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:10.030
<v Speaker 1>And so now for the chicken,</v>

283
00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.780
<v Speaker 1>people was changing shape all the time.</v>

284
00:11:12.781 --> 00:11:15.210
<v Speaker 1>Or The kid would be underneath there trying to bang his head on.</v>

285
00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:21.260
<v Speaker 1>So if you and your wife has forged a unit that isn't penetrable in some sense,</v>

286
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:26.130
<v Speaker 1>then they're going to push and push until we find out could that doesn't work.</v>

287
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:27.420
<v Speaker 1>And then they're not going to replay that.</v>

288
00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.410
<v Speaker 1>And that's going to be really good for you because then your children will</v>

289
00:11:31.411 --> 00:11:34.620
<v Speaker 1>torture you to death and it's really going to be good for your child because</v>

290
00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:39.120
<v Speaker 1>they're going to have tested the limits and find out that there are walls to</v>

291
00:11:39.121 --> 00:11:42.540
<v Speaker 1>keep the chaos and that's going to make them feel secure.</v>

292
00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:45.570
<v Speaker 1>And then they're wanting to be able to develop within that security.</v>

293
00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:47.430
<v Speaker 1>So that's a perfect deal.</v>

294
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:50.760
<v Speaker 1>And so that's my advice for you.</v>

295
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:52.740
<v Speaker 1>Who's having to some on the 25th</v>

296
00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:14.740
<v Speaker 1>thinks that you might want to think.</v>

297
00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:19.300
<v Speaker 1>I have a chapter called,</v>

298
00:12:19.301 --> 00:12:21.770
<v Speaker 1>don't let your children do anything that makes you dislike</v>

299
00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:25.393
<v Speaker 1>dark</v>

300
00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.393
<v Speaker 1>as well</v>

301
00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:32.703
<v Speaker 1>low.</v>

302
00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.650
<v Speaker 1>The more you're able to construct the dark.</v>

303
00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:41.110
<v Speaker 1>And so if you pretended that it sounds like it up,</v>

304
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:43.600
<v Speaker 1>then why should anyone listen to you?</v>

305
00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:43.991
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

306
00:12:43.991 --> 00:12:45.010
<v Speaker 1>I know what life was like.</v>

307
00:12:45.011 --> 00:12:49.610
<v Speaker 1>I spent 20,000 always counseling people through the most difficult things that,</v>

308
00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:53.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

309
00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:54.260
<v Speaker 1>they were just selling.</v>

310
00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:55.203
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>

311
00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.390
<v Speaker 1>it could help them solve a problem,</v>

312
00:12:57.490 --> 00:12:59.610
<v Speaker 1>even with the best will own their car.</v>

313
00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:03.040
<v Speaker 1>And we just cornered into this new damage is very,</v>

314
00:13:03.041 --> 00:13:03.874
<v Speaker 1>very bad.</v>

315
00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:08.980
<v Speaker 1>But most of the time it was a very positive experience because very frequently</v>

316
00:13:08.981 --> 00:13:09.760
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

317
00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.640
<v Speaker 1>even in dire straits can make your legs look better than they are.</v>

318
00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:13.953
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

319
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:14.900
<v Speaker 1>but to do that,</v>

320
00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:19.940
<v Speaker 1>well you have to have to confront what's terrible life like just try to by 11</v>

321
00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:23.510
<v Speaker 1>and so you have to,</v>

322
00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:24.550
<v Speaker 1>to deal with that.</v>

323
00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:25.653
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

324
00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:29.710
<v Speaker 1>how should you structure the future children's education?</v>

325
00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:30.860
<v Speaker 1>What were the first thing?</v>

326
00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:34.080
<v Speaker 1>And we had to little fire.</v>

327
00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.153
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

328
00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.620
<v Speaker 1>the reason you don't want to let your children do anything that makes you</v>

329
00:13:38.621 --> 00:13:39.281
<v Speaker 1>dislike for this,</v>

330
00:13:39.281 --> 00:13:43.360
<v Speaker 1>because you'll be mean if you don't mind and you're waiting or to them and</v>

331
00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:44.980
<v Speaker 1>really capable of being mean.</v>

332
00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.030
<v Speaker 1>And you might be neat because like you're,</v>

333
00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:49.420
<v Speaker 1>you're the sort person who abuses your child physically.</v>

334
00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:50.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

335
00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:50.681
<v Speaker 1>you laugh.</v>

336
00:13:50.681 --> 00:13:51.910
<v Speaker 1>Shall we have a terrible temper?</v>

337
00:13:51.911 --> 00:13:53.800
<v Speaker 1>And they're angry at them when they succeeded.</v>

338
00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:57.850
<v Speaker 1>Your brutal or you might be the sort of person that smothers the with dependent</v>

339
00:13:57.851 --> 00:14:01.940
<v Speaker 1>law and either way it can just do them in and you can do both of those</v>

340
00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:03.470
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably needly.</v>

341
00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:04.810
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't like the children,</v>

342
00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.460
<v Speaker 1>that is exactly what we do.</v>

343
00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:07.620
<v Speaker 1>And they might think,</v>

344
00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:09.100
<v Speaker 1>oh no you won't because you love them.</v>

345
00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:09.400
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

346
00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:10.410
<v Speaker 1>yes you will.</v>

347
00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:14.180
<v Speaker 1>That's what people are like and that's why families are often such a stinky.</v>

348
00:14:14.181 --> 00:14:18.340
<v Speaker 1>It's of catastrophe and they don't have to be like they frequently are and lots</v>

349
00:14:18.341 --> 00:14:21.490
<v Speaker 1>of people's whole life journey is to fight their way out.</v>

350
00:14:21.491 --> 00:14:22.940
<v Speaker 1>If they're unbelievably powerful,</v>

351
00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:23.793
<v Speaker 1>multiple family,</v>

352
00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:25.620
<v Speaker 1>that's the whole [inaudible] nightmare.</v>

353
00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:27.663
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

354
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:32.620
<v Speaker 1>you want to encourage your children to behave in a manner that makes you deeply</v>

355
00:14:32.621 --> 00:14:34.390
<v Speaker 1>appreciate the fact that they exist.</v>

356
00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:37.670
<v Speaker 1>Now you're kind of praised because you're only one person.</v>

357
00:14:37.671 --> 00:14:40.890
<v Speaker 1>And so hopefully you have someone around you that's your long term partner and</v>

358
00:14:40.891 --> 00:14:44.680
<v Speaker 1>say who could slap you on the back of the head and you're being too insane</v>

359
00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:46.360
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

360
00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:48.860
<v Speaker 1>part of what might make you dislike your children,</v>

361
00:14:48.861 --> 00:14:51.820
<v Speaker 1>just the fact that you just only have your act together well and they're doing</v>

362
00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:52.281
<v Speaker 1>perfectly,</v>

363
00:14:52.281 --> 00:14:54.830
<v Speaker 1>you will key things if you happen to be irritated about it.</v>

364
00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:58.760
<v Speaker 1>And so that's part of why you need a partner to sort of alerting when you meet</v>

365
00:14:58.761 --> 00:15:00.310
<v Speaker 1>unreasonable above your match.</v>

366
00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.090
<v Speaker 1>And hopefully the two of you were different enough.</v>

367
00:15:02.091 --> 00:15:07.091
<v Speaker 1>So you're a Melba makes you one half decent put together person and that person</v>

368
00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:09.820
<v Speaker 1>helps the child learn how to be likable.</v>

369
00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.150
<v Speaker 1>So other people like,</v>

370
00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:13.310
<v Speaker 1>so the first thing you want to figure out,</v>

371
00:15:13.311 --> 00:15:17.460
<v Speaker 1>if you want your child to have a proper relationship with being,</v>

372
00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:17.930
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

373
00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:18.350
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

374
00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:20.090
<v Speaker 1>whether that's actually what you want,</v>

375
00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:21.681
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

376
00:15:21.681 --> 00:15:22.540
<v Speaker 1>because you might get hit.</v>

377
00:15:22.541 --> 00:15:22.881
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

378
00:15:22.881 --> 00:15:24.380
<v Speaker 1>that's what people want for their children.</v>

379
00:15:24.381 --> 00:15:24.681
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

380
00:15:24.681 --> 00:15:25.210
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

381
00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:25.580
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

382
00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:25.721
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

383
00:15:25.721 --> 00:15:26.554
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

384
00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:27.493
<v Speaker 1>And it's not.</v>

385
00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.900
<v Speaker 1>Lots of people have terrible parents and they're not just carrot to be them.</v>

386
00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:33.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's bad,</v>

387
00:15:33.771 --> 00:15:34.490
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>

388
00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:37.070
<v Speaker 1>That's something that starts neglect.</v>

389
00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:38.500
<v Speaker 1>Kids can handle latch.</v>

390
00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:38.811
<v Speaker 1>One does,</v>

391
00:15:38.811 --> 00:15:39.770
<v Speaker 1>it's not total.</v>

392
00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.530
<v Speaker 1>But I've had clients whose parents didn't.</v>

393
00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:45.170
<v Speaker 1>Every time that person did something good,</v>

394
00:15:45.171 --> 00:15:49.220
<v Speaker 1>their parents punished every single time until they were terrified of doing</v>

395
00:15:49.221 --> 00:15:50.180
<v Speaker 1>anything at all.</v>

396
00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:54.500
<v Speaker 1>And either punished by criticizing to death when they have the goal to try to do</v>

397
00:15:54.501 --> 00:15:59.501
<v Speaker 1>something useful in the world or acting as if they were absolutely terrified out</v>

398
00:16:00.171 --> 00:16:00.921
<v Speaker 1>of their skeletal.</v>

399
00:16:00.921 --> 00:16:02.570
<v Speaker 1>Every time a child took a risk,</v>

400
00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:06.290
<v Speaker 1>which is the sort of helicopter parenting that so absolutely Kevin Scott,</v>

401
00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.000
<v Speaker 1>don't get upset your mother,</v>

402
00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:08.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

403
00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:12.050
<v Speaker 1>with your courageous and forthright action in the world,</v>

404
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:12.591
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

405
00:16:12.591 --> 00:16:14.420
<v Speaker 1>And so then see if you do that,</v>

406
00:16:14.421 --> 00:16:16.460
<v Speaker 1>then you can associate courageous action,</v>

407
00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:17.353
<v Speaker 1>guilt.</v>

408
00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:20.350
<v Speaker 1>If you really want to do into your kids and then that's an excellent trick and</v>

409
00:16:20.351 --> 00:16:23.540
<v Speaker 1>take the best thing about them and make them feel horrible about it.</v>

410
00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.070
<v Speaker 1>That's a good trip.</v>

411
00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:26.810
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't think you're capable of that,</v>

412
00:16:26.811 --> 00:16:30.350
<v Speaker 1>then you're not taking it because you are capable of and it's a real danger.</v>

413
00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:34.290
<v Speaker 1>It's the danger of over protectiveness cause it takes a real courageous parents</v>

414
00:16:34.291 --> 00:16:35.124
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

415
00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:36.031
<v Speaker 1>It's so interesting.</v>

416
00:16:36.031 --> 00:16:37.190
<v Speaker 1>I watched this video last night,</v>

417
00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:37.581
<v Speaker 1>my wife,</v>

418
00:16:37.581 --> 00:16:38.450
<v Speaker 1>she went to me,</v>

419
00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:41.690
<v Speaker 1>I think it was from Russia because I don't think this could have ever possibly</v>

420
00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:42.470
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

421
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:45.560
<v Speaker 1>America is typically about two,</v>

422
00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:48.440
<v Speaker 1>I think he's still in diapers 30 mobile.</v>

423
00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:52.630
<v Speaker 1>And you know we had their parents had put up one of those little doorways that</v>

424
00:16:52.631 --> 00:16:56.950
<v Speaker 1>we put up for kids in the door that keeps them in the room or maybe stops him</v>

425
00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:58.190
<v Speaker 1>from falling down the stairs.</v>

426
00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.710
<v Speaker 1>And so it had one of those little things.</v>

427
00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:02.730
<v Speaker 1>But there's actually two.</v>

428
00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:07.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking because this kid had and learn how to get client to reflect and</v>

429
00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:12.310
<v Speaker 1>learn a little,</v>

430
00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:18.330
<v Speaker 1>the little door with the post Nicco another one on top and he climbed up a hell</v>

431
00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:23.330
<v Speaker 1>of a time going up over the top and he was in diapers.</v>

432
00:17:23.331 --> 00:17:23.931
<v Speaker 1>If you look at that,</v>

433
00:17:23.931 --> 00:17:25.030
<v Speaker 1>you think that</v>

434
00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:27.890
<v Speaker 1>that's what's going to happen.</v>

435
00:17:28.070 --> 00:17:30.150
<v Speaker 1>But the parents did interfere.</v>

436
00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.370
<v Speaker 1>They videotaped it.</v>

437
00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:34.370
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

438
00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:36.410
<v Speaker 1>it's not abusive.</v>

439
00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:40.360
<v Speaker 1>Here's what's abusive is you wait until the kid is three quarters of the way up.</v>

440
00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:41.360
<v Speaker 1>The second one,</v>

441
00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:45.260
<v Speaker 1>so like five feet off the ground and then you have a little panic attack about</v>

442
00:17:45.261 --> 00:17:46.160
<v Speaker 1>how or it is.</v>

443
00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:51.430
<v Speaker 1>So then you upset the child so that he fall and hurt himself and then you'd tell</v>

444
00:17:51.471 --> 00:17:53.580
<v Speaker 1>him that's what happens when you do that sort of thing.</v>

445
00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:59.180
<v Speaker 1>That's abuse and they get to do that [inaudible] point and it's like it's a</v>

446
00:18:06.991 --> 00:18:08.700
<v Speaker 1>courageous terror who stands back.</v>

447
00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:11.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't want that kid this fall,</v>

448
00:18:11.671 --> 00:18:15.240
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not going to mock about movies out there like a master in new world.</v>

449
00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:17.040
<v Speaker 1>So that's what we do.</v>

450
00:18:17.041 --> 00:18:20.820
<v Speaker 1>If you have some courage and you let your children take your us because if you</v>

451
00:18:20.821 --> 00:18:23.400
<v Speaker 1>don't have lumps are going to get a lot of big.</v>

452
00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:24.763
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

453
00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:31.140
<v Speaker 1>you want the best for your children and you've got to ask yourself that question</v>

454
00:18:31.141 --> 00:18:34.600
<v Speaker 1>seriously because there's at least is a big part of you that came the part,</v>

455
00:18:34.601 --> 00:18:37.170
<v Speaker 1>let's say it does not want the best for your children.</v>

456
00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:39.660
<v Speaker 1>It could be an annoying if it was successful,</v>

457
00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:40.700
<v Speaker 1>that would be fun.</v>

458
00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:41.890
<v Speaker 1>How they succeeded.</v>

459
00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:43.080
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

460
00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:47.340
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't think that's true that you do not know anything because it is</v>

461
00:18:47.341 --> 00:18:49.610
<v Speaker 1>your and [inaudible] and everyone's like [inaudible].</v>

462
00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:51.900
<v Speaker 1>Some people are really like that.</v>

463
00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:53.950
<v Speaker 1>So when you might think that it's dark,</v>

464
00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:56.200
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have cause reality and,</v>

465
00:18:56.410 --> 00:19:01.410
<v Speaker 1>and [inaudible],</v>

466
00:19:06.601 --> 00:19:09.240
<v Speaker 1>what would you say to someone who doesn't feel like he,</v>

467
00:19:09.241 --> 00:19:10.840
<v Speaker 1>not while you're right,</v>

468
00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:13.811
<v Speaker 1>touching.</v>

469
00:19:13.811 --> 00:19:14.644
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

470
00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:17.820
<v Speaker 1>what do you shouldn't do is beat yourself up because of that.</v>

471
00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:20.310
<v Speaker 1>Like you're not enough and it shouldn't,</v>

472
00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:21.300
<v Speaker 1>it shouldn't take you are,</v>

473
00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:22.290
<v Speaker 1>because then what the hell are you,</v>

474
00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:23.461
<v Speaker 1>are you going to do?</v>

475
00:19:23.461 --> 00:19:25.110
<v Speaker 1>If you're already on attaining the goal,</v>

476
00:19:25.111 --> 00:19:26.170
<v Speaker 1>you've got nothing to do it.</v>

477
00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:26.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

478
00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:31.560
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I've noticed talking to audiences like this over the last year</v>

479
00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:32.310
<v Speaker 1>and a half or so,</v>

480
00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:35.280
<v Speaker 1>the audience gets very quiet when I talk about two things.</v>

481
00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:37.410
<v Speaker 1>One is responsibility.</v>

482
00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:41.090
<v Speaker 1>Every medical is quiet to cancel school because of grips,</v>

483
00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:41.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

484
00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:42.270
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

485
00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:42.391
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

486
00:19:42.391 --> 00:19:43.350
<v Speaker 1>there's something to that.</v>

487
00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:46.390
<v Speaker 1>And you know that the audience goes quiet when we talk,</v>

488
00:19:46.391 --> 00:19:47.160
<v Speaker 1>it comes up.</v>

489
00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:50.700
<v Speaker 1>You know there's something in the Internet because it's unspoken necessity</v>

490
00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:51.840
<v Speaker 1>that's manifesting itself.</v>

491
00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:54.210
<v Speaker 1>It's that</v>

492
00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:00.210
<v Speaker 1>this issue of self esteem.</v>

493
00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:05.460
<v Speaker 1>So would I be suggesting to people psychologists plus the soil,</v>

494
00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:08.160
<v Speaker 1>especially the ones that aren't very well informed,</v>

495
00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:13.170
<v Speaker 1>haven't been telling people for five decades that they should have high self</v>

496
00:20:13.171 --> 00:20:14.004
<v Speaker 1>esteem.</v>

497
00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:14.963
<v Speaker 1>It's like</v>

498
00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:19.860
<v Speaker 1>most of what passes for self esteem has been shaped by a psychologist is</v>

499
00:20:19.861 --> 00:20:21.450
<v Speaker 1>actually the temperamental trait.</v>

500
00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:25.260
<v Speaker 1>So if you take self esteem scales and you score heights because you're</v>

501
00:20:25.261 --> 00:20:27.090
<v Speaker 1>extroverted and low in neuroticism,</v>

502
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:29.160
<v Speaker 1>so the scales are wrong,</v>

503
00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:30.610
<v Speaker 1>that's one.</v>

504
00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:34.320
<v Speaker 1>And number two is who the hell says you should have high self esteem.</v>

505
00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:35.340
<v Speaker 1>What's so great about,</v>

506
00:20:35.341 --> 00:20:36.174
<v Speaker 1>you</v>

507
00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:39.980
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

508
00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:43.170
<v Speaker 1>it's not because people are very happy with who they are.</v>

509
00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:44.693
<v Speaker 1>And so if you tell them,</v>

510
00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:45.031
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

511
00:20:45.031 --> 00:20:45.950
<v Speaker 1>you're good to read more.</v>

512
00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:47.080
<v Speaker 1>I think wait a,</v>

513
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:50.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm not very happy with the way things are with me.</v>

514
00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:53.400
<v Speaker 1>And so I was supposed to be happy with the way I'm and I'm,</v>

515
00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:54.070
<v Speaker 1>and then like,</v>

516
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:54.890
<v Speaker 1>what about this?</v>

517
00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:56.530
<v Speaker 1>This read this part of my life.</v>

518
00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:00.070
<v Speaker 1>And so it's not a good thing to tell people that they're just okay the way they</v>

519
00:21:00.071 --> 00:21:00.580
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

520
00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:02.290
<v Speaker 1>That's not at all.</v>

521
00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:06.100
<v Speaker 1>What do you want to tell them is you could be winging when did you are,</v>

522
00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:09.930
<v Speaker 1>you could be way more than you are and that would be bad.</v>

523
00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:12.940
<v Speaker 1>That would be better for you and it would be better for your feminist would be</v>

524
00:21:12.941 --> 00:21:17.430
<v Speaker 1>better for the country to be better for every and there's something about east</v>

525
00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:19.780
<v Speaker 1>sufficient and wretched as you are.</v>

526
00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:21.490
<v Speaker 1>Then could you start that,</v>

527
00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:26.610
<v Speaker 1>start on that path and be successful and so it isn't that you should be that you</v>

528
00:21:29.561 --> 00:21:31.840
<v Speaker 1>should be happy with yourself because of who you are.</v>

529
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:37.390
<v Speaker 1>It's that you should be the sexual of yourself because you are the sort of</v>

530
00:21:37.391 --> 00:21:42.391
<v Speaker 1>person who transformed herself into and that's way better.</v>

531
00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:49.700
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

532
00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:52.990
<v Speaker 1>I want to put up a little bit boundary road that look,</v>

533
00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:58.410
<v Speaker 1>I know that people beat themselves up at the time and so it could be two jumps</v>

534
00:21:59.311 --> 00:22:02.400
<v Speaker 1>medical with regards to yourself and that means getting aggression.</v>

535
00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:03.660
<v Speaker 1>I notice of anxiety.</v>

536
00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:06.030
<v Speaker 1>Can you really have and committed suicide?</v>

537
00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:09.490
<v Speaker 1>You got out of it despite the fact that you thought of anything you could be,</v>

538
00:22:09.491 --> 00:22:12.030
<v Speaker 1>you have to have a little bit of mercy that you're touched towards you.</v>

539
00:22:12.031 --> 00:22:13.000
<v Speaker 1>So if you don't want to,</v>

540
00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:13.840
<v Speaker 1>you don't want it.</v>

541
00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:16.900
<v Speaker 1>You want to treat yourself with someone that you're trying to help.</v>

542
00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:17.710
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

543
00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:18.790
<v Speaker 1>That's another talking,</v>

544
00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:22.630
<v Speaker 1>talking to treat yourself like you're someone who responsible for help and that</v>

545
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:23.850
<v Speaker 1>regards to the detachment.</v>

546
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:27.380
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that you're worthwhile despite your analysis.</v>

547
00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:29.920
<v Speaker 1>And then if necessary in the world,</v>

548
00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:31.200
<v Speaker 1>at least in the bowl,</v>

549
00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:32.203
<v Speaker 1>it's to help.</v>

550
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:36.130
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's absolutely the case because you could certainly generate,</v>

551
00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:37.820
<v Speaker 1>it'll help yourself up too much.</v>

552
00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:41.740
<v Speaker 1>So you've been at least not do that and that would be important.</v>

553
00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:45.640
<v Speaker 1>So it's reasonable to treat yourself with a certain amount of detached to the</v>

554
00:22:45.641 --> 00:22:49.510
<v Speaker 1>SPEC and then the garden himself to someone you should try to help.</v>

555
00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:53.150
<v Speaker 1>Like you would help someone character in a detached sort of way.</v>

556
00:22:53.151 --> 00:22:55.490
<v Speaker 1>Because if people have melanin,</v>

557
00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:57.250
<v Speaker 1>if other people have value,</v>

558
00:22:57.490 --> 00:23:01.690
<v Speaker 1>then you have melted and you load yourself the same ethical responsibility that</v>

559
00:23:01.691 --> 00:23:03.770
<v Speaker 1>you owe other people and maybe what you want.</v>

560
00:23:03.771 --> 00:23:07.810
<v Speaker 1>What other people is the responsibility to help them along the way so that the</v>

561
00:23:07.811 --> 00:23:09.490
<v Speaker 1>world gets better rather than worse.</v>

562
00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:12.490
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the same attitude that you should think to yourself.</v>

563
00:23:12.491 --> 00:23:15.260
<v Speaker 1>So despite the fact that you're not all that you should be,</v>

564
00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:19.030
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that you have plenty to learn and they should learn it,</v>

565
00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:19.720
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>

566
00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:23.860
<v Speaker 1>you also don't get to beat yourself to death with a stick all the time because</v>

567
00:23:23.861 --> 00:23:26.410
<v Speaker 1>you're in submission 50 different ways.</v>

568
00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:28.960
<v Speaker 1>So justice,</v>

569
00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:32.950
<v Speaker 1>that's the judgment and mercy is what enables you to tolerate the judgment.</v>

570
00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:37.900
<v Speaker 1>And you need to use both of those forums to discuss the proper relationship with</v>

571
00:23:37.901 --> 00:23:38.734
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>

572
00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:40.890
<v Speaker 1>And so you're not enough.</v>

573
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:45.140
<v Speaker 1>Thank God for that because you wouldn't have anything worthwhile to do if you</v>

574
00:23:45.141 --> 00:23:47.390
<v Speaker 1>were to not do,</v>

575
00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:49.640
<v Speaker 1>which is to make things better than they are,</v>

576
00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:50.810
<v Speaker 1>including yourself.</v>

577
00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:51.823
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

578
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:58.990
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

579
00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:18.830
<v Speaker 1>do you pray?</v>

580
00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:29.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't ask God for fees.</v>

581
00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:33.220
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's what people do.</v>

582
00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:34.493
<v Speaker 1>Pray</v>

583
00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:42.670
<v Speaker 1>prayer is actually something that works but asked him,</v>

584
00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:44.780
<v Speaker 1>cause that doesn't work.</v>

585
00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:51.440
<v Speaker 1>You could ask to have enough courage to see the truth.</v>

586
00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:54.140
<v Speaker 1>And that's a painful thing to do.</v>

587
00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:55.191
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

588
00:24:55.191 --> 00:24:55.521
<v Speaker 1>here's the,</v>

589
00:24:55.521 --> 00:24:58.250
<v Speaker 1>here's the prayer of sorts.</v>

590
00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:01.020
<v Speaker 1>So imagine you're having a fight with your wife and it's only you.</v>

591
00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:03.500
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's this sort of fight that makes you women,</v>

592
00:25:03.501 --> 00:25:05.540
<v Speaker 1>whether he should be in the damn relationship.</v>

593
00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.033
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

594
00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:07.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

595
00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:09.970
<v Speaker 1>every fight you tending in that direction,</v>

596
00:25:09.971 --> 00:25:10.804
<v Speaker 1>which is awesome,</v>

597
00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:15.440
<v Speaker 1>why can't we won't have flex up that entire space of catastrophe?</v>

598
00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:16.800
<v Speaker 1>And it's part of the light.</v>

599
00:25:16.801 --> 00:25:18.230
<v Speaker 1>You want to be serious about it.</v>

600
00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:22.580
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to open up to the possibility that you could leave every time you</v>

601
00:25:22.581 --> 00:25:23.330
<v Speaker 1>have a fight.</v>
