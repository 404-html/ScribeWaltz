1
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:10.751
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2
00:00:10.751 --> 00:00:11.620
<v Speaker 1>Hypothetically,</v>

3
00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.230
<v Speaker 1>it's an attitude of skepticism,</v>

4
00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.720
<v Speaker 1>irony towards rejection of grand narratives,</v>

5
00:00:16.721 --> 00:00:18.280
<v Speaker 1>ideologies and universalism.</v>

6
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.440
<v Speaker 1>Critique,</v>

7
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.920
<v Speaker 1>criticize this objective,</v>

8
00:00:20.921 --> 00:00:22.060
<v Speaker 1>notions of reason,</v>

9
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:22.991
<v Speaker 1>human nature,</v>

10
00:00:22.991 --> 00:00:23.950
<v Speaker 1>social progress,</v>

11
00:00:23.951 --> 00:00:25.810
<v Speaker 1>absolute truth in objective reality.</v>

12
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.430
<v Speaker 1>It's predicated on the idea that the reason that you categorize,</v>

13
00:00:30.431 --> 00:00:35.431
<v Speaker 1>especially the reason that you categorize is to marginalize you.</v>

14
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.530
<v Speaker 1>Categorize to marginalized,</v>

15
00:00:37.531 --> 00:00:38.460
<v Speaker 1>to obtain power.</v>

16
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.750
<v Speaker 1>Power is pretty much all there is.</v>

17
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:42.223
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

18
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.550
<v Speaker 1>there's other elements of postmodernism.</v>

19
00:00:45.551 --> 00:00:49.330
<v Speaker 1>One of them is that human nature is merely a social construct.</v>

20
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.581
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

21
00:00:51.581 --> 00:00:53.440
<v Speaker 1>the reason for that as far as I'm concerned,</v>

22
00:00:53.441 --> 00:00:55.150
<v Speaker 1>and this is a postmodern critique as well,</v>

23
00:00:55.151 --> 00:00:58.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to move the center to the margin and the margin to the centers.</v>

24
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.260
<v Speaker 1>Why would you think that human nature is only a social construct?</v>

25
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.981
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

26
00:01:02.981 --> 00:01:03.551
<v Speaker 1>here's why.</v>

27
00:01:03.551 --> 00:01:06.340
<v Speaker 1>It's because that means you could construct it any way you want to.</v>

28
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.530
<v Speaker 1>That was a very common idea among this among the communists.</v>

29
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.230
<v Speaker 1>That's why my wanted to wipe out Chinese history.</v>

30
00:01:14.231 --> 00:01:16.300
<v Speaker 1>That's why the red guard went around in China,</v>

31
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.220
<v Speaker 1>tried to destroy everything,</v>

32
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.700
<v Speaker 1>every element of China's history prior to approximately 1960 at that great</v>

33
00:01:24.851 --> 00:01:25.271
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

34
00:01:25.271 --> 00:01:27.400
<v Speaker 1>thousands and thousands of years old as well.</v>

35
00:01:27.401 --> 00:01:28.840
<v Speaker 1>So you could bring in the new man.</v>

36
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.270
<v Speaker 1>But what does the new man,</v>

37
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.070
<v Speaker 1>well it was whatever slave mile happened to fantasize about or it was the</v>

38
00:01:36.071 --> 00:01:37.220
<v Speaker 1>utopian person.</v>

39
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.260
<v Speaker 1>You take your pick.</v>

40
00:01:38.261 --> 00:01:39.790
<v Speaker 1>But like I said,</v>

41
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.410
<v Speaker 1>if you take a look at the corpses,</v>

42
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.980
<v Speaker 1>you can pretty much figure out which of those two it was.</v>

43
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.410
<v Speaker 1>So what's up with these people?</v>

44
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.770
<v Speaker 1>These deconstructionists sees postmodernists.</v>

45
00:01:51.771 --> 00:01:53.090
<v Speaker 1>What are they up to exactly?</v>

46
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.871
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

47
00:01:53.871 --> 00:01:54.920
<v Speaker 1>here's the first thing</v>

48
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.150
<v Speaker 1>they came about pretty much when Marxism was no longer credible,</v>

49
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.400
<v Speaker 1>no longer tenable as an intellectual,</v>

50
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.710
<v Speaker 1>a set of intellectual propositions.</v>

51
00:02:08.711 --> 00:02:09.400
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

52
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.990
<v Speaker 1>if you are a French intellectual,</v>

53
00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.010
<v Speaker 1>you had to have a lot of corpses piled at your feet before you were willing to</v>

54
00:02:15.011 --> 00:02:16.210
<v Speaker 1>think that you were wrong.</v>

55
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.390
<v Speaker 1>So here's an example.</v>

56
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember his name.</v>

57
00:02:20.861 --> 00:02:24.820
<v Speaker 1>He was the architect of the killing fields in Cambodia,</v>

58
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.050
<v Speaker 1>wasn't Pol Pot.</v>

59
00:02:26.051 --> 00:02:27.640
<v Speaker 1>It was one of his advisors.</v>

60
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.601
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

61
00:02:28.601 --> 00:02:29.530
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember his name.</v>

62
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.450
<v Speaker 1>He took his phd at the Sorbonne</v>

63
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.310
<v Speaker 1>and he developed the thesis in the Sorbonne Would Marxists thesis that the</v>

64
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.120
<v Speaker 1>cities were parasites on,</v>

65
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.993
<v Speaker 1>on the land.</v>

66
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.901
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

67
00:02:43.901 --> 00:02:46.660
<v Speaker 1>it's an extension of the whole bourgeoisie proletarian thing.</v>

68
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.730
<v Speaker 1>The cities were full of bourgeois types,</v>

69
00:02:48.731 --> 00:02:53.731
<v Speaker 1>educated and educated parasites essentially who were doing nothing but stealing</v>

70
00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.560
<v Speaker 1>what was rightly the farmers.</v>

71
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.310
<v Speaker 1>So when he came back Cambodia,</v>

72
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.560
<v Speaker 1>he put that into action and empty Delta cities and put all the intellectuals in</v>

73
00:03:05.561 --> 00:03:07.840
<v Speaker 1>the city dwellers either to death or to work,</v>

74
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.870
<v Speaker 1>which generally resulted in death and killed about one sixth to one quarter of</v>

75
00:03:13.331 --> 00:03:14.164
<v Speaker 1>the population.</v>

76
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.010
<v Speaker 1>But he got his phd from the Sorbonne.</v>

77
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.293
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

78
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.910
<v Speaker 1>That's a good story because that's exactly how complicit the western leftist</v>

79
00:03:23.911 --> 00:03:28.600
<v Speaker 1>intellectuals were in facilitating the horrors of the 20th century.</v>

80
00:03:28.601 --> 00:03:31.190
<v Speaker 1>And it's not like we've learned anything since then.</v>

81
00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.240
<v Speaker 1>Quite the contrary,</v>

82
00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.530
<v Speaker 1>we just gone underground and that's what I see.</v>

83
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.410
<v Speaker 1>That's what I see when I see postmodernism.</v>

84
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.540
<v Speaker 1>So what happened was,</v>

85
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.860
<v Speaker 1>despite the affinity Western intellectuals for Marxism,</v>

86
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.480
<v Speaker 1>maybe because they weren't paid as much as bankers,</v>

87
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:56.373
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

88
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.880
<v Speaker 1>if we're being cynical about it,</v>

89
00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.540
<v Speaker 1>because I've often thought that if you paid sociologists as much as investment</v>

90
00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:02.290
<v Speaker 1>bankers,</v>

91
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.970
<v Speaker 1>they'd be capitalist very rapidly.</v>

92
00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

93
00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.480
<v Speaker 1>which is also to say that you may underpay intellectuals at your peril and you</v>

94
00:04:11.481 --> 00:04:14.840
<v Speaker 1>know that's actually dangerous because one of the things that's happening is</v>

95
00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.710
<v Speaker 1>that as the universities have become corporatized and corrupted in a variety of</v>

96
00:04:18.711 --> 00:04:19.370
<v Speaker 1>ways,</v>

97
00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.800
<v Speaker 1>more and more of the professors or adjuncts,</v>

98
00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:22.200
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

99
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.010
<v Speaker 1>Think it's up to 30 40 50% something like that.</v>

100
00:04:25.011 --> 00:04:26.310
<v Speaker 1>Now they've got no tenure,</v>

101
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.530
<v Speaker 1>they've got no job security,</v>

102
00:04:27.531 --> 00:04:29.780
<v Speaker 1>and they're paid like $24,000 a year.</v>

103
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.740
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good idea to radicalize the people that are teaching your children.</v>

104
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.843
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

105
00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:39.583
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

106
00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.920
<v Speaker 1>by the end of the sixties so much data on the catastrophic failures of communism</v>

107
00:04:48.441 --> 00:04:53.441
<v Speaker 1>had accrued that even the most intransigent of French intellectuals had to admit</v>

108
00:04:54.351 --> 00:04:56.060
<v Speaker 1>that the Jig was up.</v>

109
00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.023
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

110
00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:03.030
<v Speaker 1>But that's a problem because that's the whole ideology,</v>

111
00:05:03.191 --> 00:05:03.491
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

112
00:05:03.491 --> 00:05:06.120
<v Speaker 1>That's the whole raise on debt.</v>

113
00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.860
<v Speaker 1>But he says in his terrible Alberta French,</v>

114
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:12.850
<v Speaker 1>you're going to just give that up.</v>

115
00:05:12.851 --> 00:05:15.010
<v Speaker 1>What are you gonna do after that?</v>

116
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:17.261
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

117
00:05:17.261 --> 00:05:20.050
<v Speaker 1>what happened was postmodernism was invented.</v>

118
00:05:20.051 --> 00:05:23.410
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a slight of hand as far as I can tell.</v>

119
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.273
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

120
00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.430
<v Speaker 1>and with postmodernism identity politics,</v>

121
00:05:27.431 --> 00:05:31.480
<v Speaker 1>and so the postmodern transformation is,</v>

122
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:33.123
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

123
00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.440
<v Speaker 1>we were a little wrong with the working class thing.</v>

124
00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.860
<v Speaker 1>It turns out that Communists killed them all.</v>

125
00:05:38.861 --> 00:05:41.080
<v Speaker 1>And capitalists make them all rich.</v>

126
00:05:41.081 --> 00:05:43.870
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually exactly the opposite of what we predicted.</v>

127
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.900
<v Speaker 1>But maybe there's still a way this could be salvaged.</v>

128
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:49.780
<v Speaker 1>How about if we,</v>

129
00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.650
<v Speaker 1>we don't say working class capitalists,</v>

130
00:05:53.651 --> 00:05:54.640
<v Speaker 1>we say oppressor,</v>

131
00:05:54.641 --> 00:05:55.510
<v Speaker 1>oppressed.</v>

132
00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:56.681
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

133
00:05:56.681 --> 00:05:57.514
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

134
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:00.681
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

135
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:04.940
<v Speaker 1>just trends transform the terminology a bit and we'll start thinking about all</v>

136
00:06:04.941 --> 00:06:07.490
<v Speaker 1>the other ways that people are oppressed and then,</v>

137
00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.650
<v Speaker 1>and all the other ways that people are oppressors.</v>

138
00:06:09.651 --> 00:06:12.800
<v Speaker 1>And then we can play the same damn game under a new guys.</v>

139
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.200
<v Speaker 1>And now look,</v>

140
00:06:15.201 --> 00:06:16.940
<v Speaker 1>the postmodernists were Marxists.</v>

141
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:18.710
<v Speaker 1>So let's make no mistake about that.</v>

142
00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:22.340
<v Speaker 1>Derrida himself said that postmodernism was a transformation of Marxism.</v>

143
00:06:22.341 --> 00:06:23.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm not making this up.</v>

144
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:24.441
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>

145
00:06:24.441 --> 00:06:25.274
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

146
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.300
<v Speaker 1>Well because you could say what postmodernism is a valid philosophical school</v>

147
00:06:29.301 --> 00:06:32.120
<v Speaker 1>and we'll get into that for a minute and they make some valid claims.</v>

148
00:06:32.121 --> 00:06:32.570
<v Speaker 1>One of them,</v>

149
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:33.141
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

150
00:06:33.141 --> 00:06:34.820
<v Speaker 1>this is a central postmodernist claim,</v>

151
00:06:34.821 --> 00:06:38.420
<v Speaker 1>is that there's an infinite number of ways of interpreting the world and that</v>

152
00:06:38.421 --> 00:06:40.520
<v Speaker 1>actually turns out to be technically correct.</v>

153
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.660
<v Speaker 1>Part of the reason that we've had a very difficult time building robots,</v>

154
00:06:44.661 --> 00:06:47.480
<v Speaker 1>AI robots that can operate in the real world,</v>

155
00:06:47.481 --> 00:06:51.710
<v Speaker 1>is because perceiving the real world turns out to be so difficult that we really</v>

156
00:06:51.711 --> 00:06:56.711
<v Speaker 1>can't figure out how human beings do it cause it is susceptible to an infinite</v>

157
00:06:56.961 --> 00:06:58.250
<v Speaker 1>number of interpretations.</v>

158
00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:59.540
<v Speaker 1>So that's actually correct.</v>

159
00:06:59.570 --> 00:06:59.751
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

160
00:06:59.751 --> 00:07:02.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to give the postmodernists a tremendous amount of credit for</v>

161
00:07:02.931 --> 00:07:06.170
<v Speaker 1>discovering that because it was discovered simultaneously and about five</v>

162
00:07:06.171 --> 00:07:08.300
<v Speaker 1>disciplines at pretty much the same time.</v>

163
00:07:08.301 --> 00:07:10.640
<v Speaker 1>But you give the devil his due.</v>
