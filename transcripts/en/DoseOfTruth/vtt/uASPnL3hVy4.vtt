1
00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.910
<v Speaker 1>There's hints about the proper and improper ways of engaging,</v>

2
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:10.181
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3
00:00:10.181 --> 00:00:13.330
<v Speaker 1>So clearly the improper way to engage is,</v>

4
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.420
<v Speaker 1>I think most clearly delineated in the Cain and Abel Story and with Kane</v>

5
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.020
<v Speaker 1>exemplifying the inappropriate way to engage with the world.</v>

6
00:00:24.021 --> 00:00:28.340
<v Speaker 1>And that's to engage with the world in a bitter,</v>

7
00:00:28.341 --> 00:00:30.140
<v Speaker 1>jealous and resentful manner.</v>

8
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:31.431
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

9
00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:34.580
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I really liked about the Cain and Abel Story and that</v>

10
00:00:34.581 --> 00:00:36.380
<v Speaker 1>theme recurs continually with the,</v>

11
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.640
<v Speaker 1>with the duality of the brothers right there,</v>

12
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.720
<v Speaker 1>there's constant conflict between a perspective that's essentially like canes</v>

13
00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:44.300
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

14
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:44.720
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

15
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.040
<v Speaker 1>and the opposite perspective,</v>

16
00:00:46.041 --> 00:00:46.874
<v Speaker 1>which all,</v>

17
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.020
<v Speaker 1>which I'll get to in a minute,</v>

18
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.470
<v Speaker 1>but Keynes sees that the world is a very,</v>

19
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:52.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.820
<v Speaker 1>tragic place and that the rewards are distributed to unfairly and that there are</v>

21
00:00:57.831 --> 00:01:00.530
<v Speaker 1>people who do better and people who do worse.</v>

22
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.240
<v Speaker 1>And as a consequence of that,</v>

23
00:01:02.241 --> 00:01:05.480
<v Speaker 1>he becomes bitter and resentful and curses God.</v>

24
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.220
<v Speaker 1>And then he becomes homicidal.</v>

25
00:01:08.221 --> 00:01:11.610
<v Speaker 1>Fratricidal which is even worse than he destroys his own ideal.</v>

26
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.400
<v Speaker 1>Then his descendants basically become genocidal,</v>

27
00:01:14.401 --> 00:01:15.390
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

28
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.920
<v Speaker 1>So that seems to be the wrong way to go about things,</v>

29
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.611
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

30
00:01:20.611 --> 00:01:23.040
<v Speaker 1>unless your goal is to make things worse,</v>

31
00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:27.940
<v Speaker 1>like it's not like it has a limited number of things,</v>

32
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.530
<v Speaker 1>has nothing to object to.</v>

33
00:01:29.531 --> 00:01:30.940
<v Speaker 1>He's got plenty to object to.</v>

34
00:01:30.941 --> 00:01:33.040
<v Speaker 1>His situation actually is bad.</v>

35
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.580
<v Speaker 1>He's overshadowed terribly by his brother who everyone loves,</v>

36
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.370
<v Speaker 1>who does it extraordinarily well and who's good at everything.</v>

37
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.200
<v Speaker 1>And the story is a bit of ambivalent about the reasons for Keynes failure,</v>

38
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.810
<v Speaker 1>although fair bit of it's laid at his own feet,</v>

39
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.400
<v Speaker 1>but he's definitely failing.</v>

40
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.110
<v Speaker 1>And so you can understand why he would have this terrible attitude.</v>

41
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.600
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is all it does is make it worse.</v>

42
00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.470
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't seem to be one of the things I've also learned as a psychologist</v>

43
00:02:00.471 --> 00:02:02.000
<v Speaker 1>sort of pondering these sorts of things.</v>

44
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.080
<v Speaker 1>It's often a lot easier to identify what you shouldn't do then what you should</v>

45
00:02:06.081 --> 00:02:06.650
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

46
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:07.130
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>

47
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.740
<v Speaker 1>I think evil is easier to identify than good.</v>

48
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.810
<v Speaker 1>I think good is trickier,</v>

49
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.210
<v Speaker 1>but evil stands out to some degree.</v>

50
00:02:14.211 --> 00:02:15.380
<v Speaker 1>And then at least you can say,</v>

51
00:02:15.381 --> 00:02:17.780
<v Speaker 1>if you're trying to get as far away from that as possible,</v>

52
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.970
<v Speaker 1>we could even say just for practical reasons,</v>

53
00:02:19.971 --> 00:02:23.240
<v Speaker 1>so your life doesn't become hell and your family life doesn't become hell.</v>

54
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.540
<v Speaker 1>At least you could get as far away from that as possible,</v>

55
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.690
<v Speaker 1>even if you weren't able to conjure up what would constitute the good as an Ame,</v>

56
00:02:31.941 --> 00:02:34.940
<v Speaker 1>you could at least avoid those sorts of pitfalls.</v>

57
00:02:34.941 --> 00:02:38.240
<v Speaker 1>And I do also think that it's pitfalls like that that really threatened our</v>

58
00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:39.230
<v Speaker 1>society right now.</v>

59
00:02:39.231 --> 00:02:39.531
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

60
00:02:39.531 --> 00:02:44.531
<v Speaker 1>that I see a tremendous rise in resentment fueling almost all of the political</v>

61
00:02:45.501 --> 00:02:50.000
<v Speaker 1>polarization that's taking place and seems unfortunate given that by and by</v>

62
00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:50.480
<v Speaker 1>large,</v>

63
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.360
<v Speaker 1>everyone on the planet is richer than they've ever been.</v>

64
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.030
<v Speaker 1>Now that that doesn't mean there's no disparity.</v>

65
00:02:56.031 --> 00:02:56.271
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

66
00:02:56.271 --> 00:02:57.560
<v Speaker 1>but there's always disparity.</v>

67
00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.491
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

68
00:02:58.491 --> 00:02:59.324
<v Speaker 1>Jacob,</v>

69
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:00.401
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

70
00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:05.350
<v Speaker 1>Jacob on Rebecca d Esau and Jacob ends up with,</v>

71
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:06.130
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

72
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.963
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

73
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.290
<v Speaker 1>with Isaac's blessing.</v>

74
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:09.850
<v Speaker 1>And so that's,</v>

75
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.400
<v Speaker 1>that's a moral catastrophe.</v>

76
00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:15.880
<v Speaker 1>And then he has to run because his brother wants to kill him.</v>

77
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.810
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the fraud suicidal motif again,</v>

78
00:03:19.811 --> 00:03:20.591
<v Speaker 1>I like that too.</v>

79
00:03:20.591 --> 00:03:21.311
<v Speaker 1>I think that's real,</v>

80
00:03:21.311 --> 00:03:21.610
<v Speaker 1>real,</v>

81
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:22.510
<v Speaker 1>really realistic.</v>

82
00:03:22.511 --> 00:03:23.230
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

83
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.450
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that Freud noted constantly,</v>

84
00:03:25.451 --> 00:03:27.520
<v Speaker 1>and this is where Freud really is a genius,</v>

85
00:03:27.521 --> 00:03:32.521
<v Speaker 1>is that the most intense hatreds and also sometimes the most intense love is</v>

86
00:03:33.371 --> 00:03:34.660
<v Speaker 1>within families.</v>

87
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:35.131
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

88
00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:38.980
<v Speaker 1>and in the Freud Ian World of psychopathology,</v>

89
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:40.623
<v Speaker 1>it's all,</v>

90
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.530
<v Speaker 1>it's all inside the family in in fact,</v>

91
00:03:44.531 --> 00:03:49.240
<v Speaker 1>the pathology in the Freud in world is actually the fact that it's all inside</v>

92
00:03:49.241 --> 00:03:52.780
<v Speaker 1>the family because people who get tangled up in the Friday and familial</v>

93
00:03:52.781 --> 00:03:53.321
<v Speaker 1>nightmare,</v>

94
00:03:53.321 --> 00:03:55.630
<v Speaker 1>which is roughly eatable in structure,</v>

95
00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.070
<v Speaker 1>can only conceptualize the world in terms of their familial relationships.</v>

96
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.060
<v Speaker 1>They've been so damaged by the and measurement and the trauma and the deceit and</v>

97
00:04:04.061 --> 00:04:06.940
<v Speaker 1>the betrayal and the blurred lines and all of that,</v>

98
00:04:06.941 --> 00:04:11.620
<v Speaker 1>that they just can't expand past the family and go out in the world.</v>

99
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.420
<v Speaker 1>So the idea that brothers can be at each other's throats,</v>

100
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:17.763
<v Speaker 1>I think is,</v>

101
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.710
<v Speaker 1>that's a very powerful idea.</v>

102
00:04:20.711 --> 00:04:22.660
<v Speaker 1>And it's not something that people like to think about.</v>

103
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.093
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

104
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.690
<v Speaker 1>so Jacob has to leave and it's not surprising because I mean,</v>

105
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.230
<v Speaker 1>what he did was pretty reprehensible.</v>

106
00:04:29.231 --> 00:04:30.310
<v Speaker 1>He betrayed his brother.</v>

107
00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:31.181
<v Speaker 1>But nonetheless,</v>

108
00:04:31.181 --> 00:04:35.410
<v Speaker 1>he's the person who dreams of the ladder that unites having an earth.</v>

109
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.160
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very perverse thing.</v>

110
00:04:39.161 --> 00:04:39.880
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

111
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.800
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things I think it does is give,</v>

112
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.971
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>

113
00:04:42.971 --> 00:04:45.850
<v Speaker 1>it gives hope to everyone because it isn't,</v>

114
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.871
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

115
00:04:46.871 --> 00:04:49.180
<v Speaker 1>if only the good guys when we're really in trouble,</v>

116
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

117
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.180
<v Speaker 1>Because it's not that easy to be a good guy.</v>

118
00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.070
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

119
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.220
<v Speaker 1>it's really not that easy.</v>

120
00:04:54.221 --> 00:04:58.720
<v Speaker 1>And most people are pretty keenly aware of all the ways that they fall short,</v>

121
00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.160
<v Speaker 1>even of their own ideals.</v>

122
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.630
<v Speaker 1>And so if there was no hope except for the good guys,</v>

123
00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.700
<v Speaker 1>almost all of us would be lost.</v>

124
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.740
<v Speaker 1>And so that's one of the things I really liked and was more surprised about with</v>

125
00:05:11.741 --> 00:05:12.850
<v Speaker 1>the old testament stories,</v>

126
00:05:12.851 --> 00:05:14.020
<v Speaker 1>is that these people are,</v>

127
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.400
<v Speaker 1>have very complex lives and they make very major moral errors by anyone's</v>

128
00:05:19.451 --> 00:05:20.021
<v Speaker 1>standard.</v>

129
00:05:20.021 --> 00:05:20.854
<v Speaker 1>And yet,</v>

130
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.010
<v Speaker 1>and yet the overall message is still hope.</v>
