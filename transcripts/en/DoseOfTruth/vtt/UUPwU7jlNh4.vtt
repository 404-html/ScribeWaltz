00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.360
We're not talking about external codes of conduct here,

2
00:00:03.361 --> 00:00:04.230
although we could.

3
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:05.423
We're not.

4
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.940
The wickedness that's being described is the act of you doing something that you

5
00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:11.940
know to be wrong,

6
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:13.493
period.

7
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.281
You know,

8
00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:16.170
and you may do something you don't know if it's wrong or not.

9
00:00:16.171 --> 00:00:18.750
That isn't a sort of thing that we're talking about and we're not talking about

10
00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:22.350
the things that you do that are right are there that other people think are

11
00:00:22.351 --> 00:00:22.740
wrong.

12
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.060
We're not talking about those either.

13
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.700
We're talking about those things that you consciously do,

14
00:00:26.701 --> 00:00:29.220
although you know them to be wrong yourself.

15
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.790
And that's the things that seem to get people into the most trouble in these

16
00:00:32.791 --> 00:00:33.420
stories.

17
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.890
And I believe that to be the case.

18
00:00:34.891 --> 00:00:36.060
I think that's very accurate.

19
00:00:36.061 --> 00:00:39.960
Psychologically it's amazing because I see this all the time.

20
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.020
If you do something wrong and it's because you're ignorant,

21
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.950
you don't know better,

22
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.520
it's,

23
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.690
it doesn't go well for you.

24
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.363
That's the case.

25
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.680
But if you do something wrong and you know it's wrong,

26
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.860
the punishment is,

27
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.190
is manifold.

28
00:00:53.191 --> 00:00:54.390
And I think the reason for that,

29
00:00:54.391 --> 00:00:57.240
I think the reason for that is because that makes you cane.

30
00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.400
It means you betray your own ideal,

31
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.150
right?

32
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.230
If you just don't know,

33
00:01:01.231 --> 00:01:01.411
well,

34
00:01:01.411 --> 00:01:02.730
you haven't betrayed your ideal,

35
00:01:02.731 --> 00:01:04.270
you're just not together.

36
00:01:04.271 --> 00:01:05.820
You maybe you're even willfully blind,

37
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.860
but if you do something you know to be wrong,

38
00:01:07.861 --> 00:01:12.000
then you've betrayed your own ideal and that lands you came says to God one once

39
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:12.960
Kayden destroys able,

40
00:01:12.961 --> 00:01:13.410
he says,

41
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.060
I cannot bear my punishment.
