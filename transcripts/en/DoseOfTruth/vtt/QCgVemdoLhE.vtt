00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.340
<v Speaker 1>Louie waterson here at attic question,</v>

2
00:00:02.341 --> 00:00:05.550
<v Speaker 1>how would you suggest someone who's a jack of all trades and master of none</v>

3
00:00:05.551 --> 00:00:08.460
<v Speaker 1>conduct themselves while you're probably high in openness,</v>

4
00:00:08.461 --> 00:00:09.420
<v Speaker 1>high in creativity.</v>

5
00:00:09.421 --> 00:00:11.820
<v Speaker 1>And one of the dangers of being high creativity,</v>

6
00:00:11.821 --> 00:00:13.680
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're also high in neuroticism,</v>

7
00:00:13.681 --> 00:00:17.580
<v Speaker 1>is that it's hard for creative people to catalyze and identity because they're</v>

8
00:00:17.581 --> 00:00:19.200
<v Speaker 1>basically pan like,</v>

9
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:21.270
<v Speaker 1>like Peter Pan or like,</v>

11
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.231
<v Speaker 1>or like Pan,</v>

12
00:00:22.231 --> 00:00:25.830
<v Speaker 1>which means everything that God of the forest is the god of everything to some</v>

13
00:00:25.831 --> 00:00:26.131
<v Speaker 1>degree.</v>

14
00:00:26.131 --> 00:00:29.430
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with being everything is that you're also nothing at the same</v>

15
00:00:29.431 --> 00:00:31.110
<v Speaker 1>time because you'd never specialize.</v>

16
00:00:31.111 --> 00:00:33.390
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say that if you're,</v>

17
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.960
<v Speaker 1>I think that being a jack of all trades is pretty damn useful.</v>

18
00:00:36.961 --> 00:00:41.610
<v Speaker 1>But I would also say that it's really necessary to buckle down and find one</v>

19
00:00:41.611 --> 00:00:45.330
<v Speaker 1>primary mode of discipline and Jack or Louie,</v>

20
00:00:45.331 --> 00:00:48.210
<v Speaker 1>if you can't figure out what you should do,</v>

21
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.920
<v Speaker 1>then guess just pick something that you think that you could hit hard and</v>

22
00:00:52.921 --> 00:00:53.700
<v Speaker 1>concentrate on.</v>

23
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.020
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to be perfect at it.</v>

24
00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:56.400
<v Speaker 1>You don't even have to get it right,</v>

25
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.200
<v Speaker 1>but pick something rather than nothing or pick something rather than all things.</v>

26
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.280
<v Speaker 1>And then set yourself to master that because you know,</v>

27
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.930
<v Speaker 1>you need to have a,</v>

28
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.600
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

29
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.160
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

30
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.150
<v Speaker 1>a discipline,</v>

31
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.410
<v Speaker 1>a primary discipline.</v>

32
00:01:10.411 --> 00:01:12.510
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely necessary to succeed in life.</v>

33
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.870
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

34
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.400
<v Speaker 1>once you have a primary discipline,</v>

35
00:01:14.401 --> 00:01:15.450
<v Speaker 1>then you can branch out and,</v>

36
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.410
<v Speaker 1>and become a multiplicity in your disciplined approach and then you're</v>

37
00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:21.360
<v Speaker 1>absolutely bloody unstoppable.</v>

38
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.180
<v Speaker 1>But you really need that initial disciplinary routine.</v>

39
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.901
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

40
00:01:24.901 --> 00:01:26.910
<v Speaker 1>this is something neat you knew up,</v>

41
00:01:26.911 --> 00:01:27.830
<v Speaker 1>knew very well.</v>

42
00:01:27.831 --> 00:01:28.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

43
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.921
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

44
00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:29.491
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

45
00:01:29.491 --> 00:01:30.720
<v Speaker 1>I just wrote about this today,</v>

46
00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:31.554
<v Speaker 1>that um,</v>

47
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.430
<v Speaker 1>it was the long unfreedom of the,</v>

48
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.630
<v Speaker 1>of Europe's subjugation to the dogmatic structures of the Catholic Church that</v>

49
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.650
<v Speaker 1>ennobled the European mind and gave it the capacity to widely range that it</v>

50
00:01:45.511 --> 00:01:46.560
<v Speaker 1>eventually developed,</v>

51
00:01:46.561 --> 00:01:48.370
<v Speaker 1>but it was that initial subjugation,</v>

52
00:01:48.371 --> 00:01:53.371
<v Speaker 1>not initial voluntary slavery that produced the discipline that produced the</v>

53
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.460
<v Speaker 1>spirit that can then go out and do other things.</v>

54
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.480
<v Speaker 1>And it's really,</v>

55
00:01:57.481 --> 00:02:01.140
<v Speaker 1>really useful to subjugate yourself something to something voluntarily.</v>

56
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.741
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

57
00:02:01.741 --> 00:02:06.510
<v Speaker 1>I think that's partly why it's useful to practice a religious faith because you</v>

58
00:02:06.511 --> 00:02:09.210
<v Speaker 1>subject yourself to a disciplinary structure that way.</v>

59
00:02:09.211 --> 00:02:10.260
<v Speaker 1>And you might think,</v>

60
00:02:10.261 --> 00:02:11.940
<v Speaker 1>well that's all oppressed if in all of that.</v>

61
00:02:11.941 --> 00:02:13.050
<v Speaker 1>And of course that's true,</v>

62
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.450
<v Speaker 1>but it also makes you disciplined.</v>

63
00:02:15.451 --> 00:02:16.470
<v Speaker 1>And once you're disciplined,</v>

64
00:02:16.471 --> 00:02:16.981
<v Speaker 1>like you're,</v>

65
00:02:16.981 --> 00:02:18.690
<v Speaker 1>you're like a sharpened sword man,</v>

66
00:02:18.691 --> 00:02:20.310
<v Speaker 1>like a well tempered blade.</v>

67
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.740
<v Speaker 1>And then you can go out there and operate in the world.</v>

68
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:23.221
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

69
00:02:23.221 --> 00:02:24.720
<v Speaker 1>and if you haven't found your passion,</v>

70
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:25.470
<v Speaker 1>then I would say,</v>

71
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.621
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

72
00:02:25.621 --> 00:02:29.460
<v Speaker 1>don't wait around until you find the damn thing because you may never find it is</v>

73
00:02:29.461 --> 00:02:31.230
<v Speaker 1>pick something and focus on it.</v>

74
00:02:31.231 --> 00:02:31.501
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

75
00:02:31.501 --> 00:02:36.450
<v Speaker 1>And if you move strongly and forthrightly towards it for a number of months at</v>

76
00:02:36.451 --> 00:02:36.811
<v Speaker 1>least,</v>

77
00:02:36.811 --> 00:02:37.950
<v Speaker 1>or even a number of years,</v>

78
00:02:37.951 --> 00:02:39.120
<v Speaker 1>and then you find,</v>

79
00:02:39.121 --> 00:02:40.590
<v Speaker 1>well that wasn't the thing for you,</v>

80
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.420
<v Speaker 1>it isn't going to be a waste to anyways.</v>

81
00:02:42.421 --> 00:02:45.510
<v Speaker 1>Because most of the time the pursuit of any discipline,</v>

82
00:02:45.511 --> 00:02:46.830
<v Speaker 1>knowledge pays off,</v>

83
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.040
<v Speaker 1>even if it doesn't pay off in the way that you initially expect.</v>
