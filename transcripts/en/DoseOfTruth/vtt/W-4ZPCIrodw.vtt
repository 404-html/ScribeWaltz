00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.610
God tells Abraham that he has to take care of his family,

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.593
his children.

3
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.050
Now the question is exactly how do you take care of your children?

4
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.190
And the answer is sometimes you make decisions for them.

5
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:13.530
Now you might say,

6
00:00:13.531 --> 00:00:13.681
well,

7
00:00:13.681 --> 00:00:16.170
it'd be better if they could make the decisions for themselves.

8
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.240
And that's actually the case.

9
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.680
So you might say,

10
00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:19.861
well,

11
00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:22.470
I won't bring my kids to church because it'd be better if they could make the

12
00:00:22.471 --> 00:00:23.760
decision for themselves.

13
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:25.830
And that's what I did with my kids,

14
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.963
you know,

15
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.040
but I'm not so sure that was a good idea.

16
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.850
And the reason I'm not so sure it was a good idea was because there are a bunch

17
00:00:32.851 --> 00:00:33.930
of things they didn't learn.

18
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.810
Now the degree to which a parents should exercise control over his or her child

19
00:00:39.811 --> 00:00:40.860
is in determinant.

20
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.240
But I guess the hope is that you exercise the minimum amount of control

21
00:00:46.241 --> 00:00:49.380
necessary to maximize the child's probability of success.

22
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.270
And that certainly requires adopting responsibility for making decisions as

23
00:00:54.271 --> 00:00:54.720
well.

24
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.370
Because the child can't make decisions.

25
00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.060
You know,

26
00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.610
you can't just let the child lay there and make decisions.

27
00:00:59.611 --> 00:00:59.940
Right.

28
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:00.240
There's,

29
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.500
that's just not going to happen.

30
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.791
And so you might say,

31
00:01:02.791 --> 00:01:02.971
well,

32
00:01:02.971 --> 00:01:07.620
Abraham has no right to impose something like circumcision on his children.

33
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.260
And because they and,

34
00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:11.700
and because it's a sacrifice.

35
00:01:11.701 --> 00:01:13.500
It's something that they should be doing themselves.

36
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.480
But the problem with that is that Abraham also has no right to abdicate his

37
00:01:18.481 --> 00:01:23.430
responsibility to his children in the name of some hypothetical merciful

38
00:01:23.431 --> 00:01:24.264
illness.

39
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.910
And those two things have to be balanced.

40
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.570
Well,

41
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.230
this,

42
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.160
according to the story,

43
00:01:29.161 --> 00:01:30.600
Abraham got the balance right,

44
00:01:30.601 --> 00:01:34.920
because of course he's made this covenant with God now exactly what that means

45
00:01:34.921 --> 00:01:36.090
in people's day to day lives.

46
00:01:36.091 --> 00:01:36.271
Well,

47
00:01:36.271 --> 00:01:37.590
that's a harder issue.

48
00:01:37.591 --> 00:01:38.820
But I would say,

49
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.500
I think in the modern world,

50
00:01:43.501 --> 00:01:45.000
people err on the side of,

51
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.673
I dunno,

52
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.330
I think they're more likely to err on the side of taking insufficient

53
00:01:51.331 --> 00:01:52.950
responsibility for their children,

54
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.880
letting them be free in ways that aren't productive.

55
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.300
That's how it looks to me often because they're afraid of their children.
