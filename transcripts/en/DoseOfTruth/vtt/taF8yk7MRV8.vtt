00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:07.661
<v Speaker 1>Hi,</v>

2
00:00:07.661 --> 00:00:08.391
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Peterson.</v>

3
00:00:08.391 --> 00:00:09.870
<v Speaker 1>Now I'd been wanting to ask you this,</v>

4
00:00:09.871 --> 00:00:10.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5
00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.300
<v Speaker 1>for a while now since I started watching your lectures.</v>

6
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:13.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

7
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.200
<v Speaker 1>after I started reading a Nietzsche's beyond good and evil,</v>

8
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.740
<v Speaker 1>I came upon a paragraph in his chapter on scholars that really,</v>

9
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.260
<v Speaker 1>really bothered me and it's actually bothers me to this day.</v>

10
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.881
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

11
00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:27.120
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

12
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.750
<v Speaker 1>he talks about this kind of person,</v>

13
00:00:28.751 --> 00:00:30.430
<v Speaker 1>like they were a just a mirror.</v>

14
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:31.421
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

15
00:00:31.421 --> 00:00:32.231
<v Speaker 1>they stretched,</v>

16
00:00:32.231 --> 00:00:36.280
<v Speaker 1>he said every part of their skin basically to allow every new piece of</v>

17
00:00:36.281 --> 00:00:40.660
<v Speaker 1>information that they took on and that all they ever were was just an</v>

18
00:00:40.661 --> 00:00:41.201
<v Speaker 1>instrument.</v>

19
00:00:41.201 --> 00:00:44.200
<v Speaker 1>They were just a mirror on reflecting what they had learned,</v>

20
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.290
<v Speaker 1>never actually having generated anything on their own.</v>

21
00:00:47.291 --> 00:00:47.890
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

22
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.490
<v Speaker 1>it's bothered me because I feel like in a way it sort of like,</v>

23
00:00:51.491 --> 00:00:51.721
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

24
00:00:51.721 --> 00:00:52.000
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

25
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.910
<v Speaker 1>it's impacted my identity a lot because I don't know,</v>

26
00:00:54.911 --> 00:00:57.520
<v Speaker 1>how are you supposed to create something,</v>

27
00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:58.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

28
00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.500
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

29
00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.771
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

30
00:00:58.771 --> 00:00:59.640
<v Speaker 1>well that's okay.</v>

31
00:00:59.641 --> 00:00:59.941
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

32
00:00:59.941 --> 00:01:01.110
<v Speaker 1>that's a really good question.</v>

33
00:01:01.111 --> 00:01:01.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

34
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.680
<v Speaker 1>neat chip is often clashed with the existentialists,</v>

35
00:01:04.681 --> 00:01:04.921
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

36
00:01:04.921 --> 00:01:07.590
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the tenants of existentialist,</v>

37
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.840
<v Speaker 1>there's two real tenants of existentialism.</v>

38
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:11.191
<v Speaker 1>There's more,</v>

39
00:01:11.191 --> 00:01:13.140
<v Speaker 1>but obviously we're oversimplifying,</v>

40
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.840
<v Speaker 1>but one is that life is a problem.</v>

41
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.570
<v Speaker 1>It isn't because there's something wrong with you.</v>

42
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.000
<v Speaker 1>It's that life is a problem.</v>

43
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.270
<v Speaker 1>And so that's often contrasted with the Friday and view,</v>

44
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.250
<v Speaker 1>which is that if you have a problem,</v>

45
00:01:26.251 --> 00:01:29.280
<v Speaker 1>it's because something went wrong during your development.</v>

46
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.600
<v Speaker 1>The existentialist said,</v>

47
00:01:30.601 --> 00:01:30.820
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

48
00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:31.590
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

49
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.870
<v Speaker 1>It's like life is a problem.</v>

50
00:01:33.871 --> 00:01:35.070
<v Speaker 1>Make no mistake about it.</v>

51
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:36.750
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

52
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.583
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

53
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.080
<v Speaker 1>the purpose of</v>

54
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.460
<v Speaker 1>the purpose of scholarship is in some sense to solve that problem.</v>

55
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.220
<v Speaker 1>And so for Nicha,</v>

56
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.821
<v Speaker 1>like he said,</v>

57
00:01:54.821 --> 00:01:56.740
<v Speaker 1>all truths are bloody truths to me.</v>

58
00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.340
<v Speaker 1>And what he meant by that was that if an idea didn't incarnate itself in you and</v>

59
00:02:03.281 --> 00:02:05.740
<v Speaker 1>transform your perceptions and your actions,</v>

60
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.080
<v Speaker 1>then you were merely possessed by the idea.</v>

61
00:02:08.081 --> 00:02:10.480
<v Speaker 1>You are merely a spokesperson for the idea.</v>

62
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.820
<v Speaker 1>Or You could say that the idea possessed you.</v>

63
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.560
<v Speaker 1>You're a puppet for the idea.</v>

64
00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.480
<v Speaker 1>It's not you.</v>

65
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.270
<v Speaker 1>It's the idea is in you and it has you.</v>

66
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.500
<v Speaker 1>You haven't taken the idea and incorporated with you and made it part of your</v>

67
00:02:23.501 --> 00:02:24.334
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

68
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.580
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a romanticism that's associated with that,</v>

69
00:02:27.581 --> 00:02:27.791
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

70
00:02:27.791 --> 00:02:29.290
<v Speaker 1>That's the passionate scholar.</v>

71
00:02:29.291 --> 00:02:31.900
<v Speaker 1>The person for whom ideas are not merely,</v>

72
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:34.761
<v Speaker 1>they're not merely,</v>

73
00:02:34.761 --> 00:02:39.761
<v Speaker 1>what would you call abstracted representations that can be tossed about as if</v>

74
00:02:41.271 --> 00:02:43.070
<v Speaker 1>they're commodities.</v>

75
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:44.540
<v Speaker 1>They're there,</v>

76
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.620
<v Speaker 1>they're more like per,</v>

77
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:46.850
<v Speaker 1>they're more like personalities.</v>

78
00:02:46.851 --> 00:02:48.830
<v Speaker 1>That might be another way of thinking about it.</v>

79
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.130
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're,</v>

80
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.691
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

81
00:02:52.691 --> 00:02:54.200
<v Speaker 1>if those ideas are compelling,</v>

82
00:02:54.201 --> 00:02:55.190
<v Speaker 1>then you don't</v>

83
00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.030
<v Speaker 1>like one thing I learned a long time ago,</v>

84
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.090
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is probably relevant,</v>

85
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.870
<v Speaker 1>I know when I was a kid I liked to argue and I like to win arguments or or,</v>

86
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:07.773
<v Speaker 1>or lose them,</v>

87
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.370
<v Speaker 1>although I like winning them a lot better,</v>

88
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.570
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't really mind so much what the content of the argument was.</v>

89
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.621
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

90
00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:19.621
<v Speaker 1>I could engage in it like a sparring match and it was in some sense to establish</v>

91
00:03:20.081 --> 00:03:20.681
<v Speaker 1>dominance,</v>

92
00:03:20.681 --> 00:03:20.891
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

93
00:03:20.891 --> 00:03:22.360
<v Speaker 1>To establish intellectual dominance.</v>

94
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.540
<v Speaker 1>I quit doing that when I was in my mid twenties because I thought that that was</v>

95
00:03:28.481 --> 00:03:30.690
<v Speaker 1>too shallow and approach to the ideas.</v>

96
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.533
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

97
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.110
<v Speaker 1>they're not commodities of that sort.</v>

98
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.973
<v Speaker 1>They're there,</v>

99
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.550
<v Speaker 1>they have tendrils that reached down into the living.</v>

100
00:03:39.551 --> 00:03:41.050
<v Speaker 1>That's the right way to think about it.</v>

101
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.500
<v Speaker 1>And so niche criticism of scholars and he did this a lot was that they were</v>

102
00:03:46.631 --> 00:03:47.464
<v Speaker 1>bloodless.</v>

103
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.891
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

104
00:03:47.891 --> 00:03:48.724
<v Speaker 1>they didn't,</v>

105
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.270
<v Speaker 1>they were full of performative contradictions.</v>

106
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.560
<v Speaker 1>That's another way of thinking about,</v>

107
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.900
<v Speaker 1>they'd say one thing and do another because their intellect was completely</v>

108
00:03:55.901 --> 00:03:57.190
<v Speaker 1>dissociated from their,</v>

109
00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.450
<v Speaker 1>from their actions.</v>

110
00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.800
<v Speaker 1>And he,</v>

111
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:00.310
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

112
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.560
<v Speaker 1>he thought that was a very bad idea.</v>

113
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.770
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's a good criticism.</v>

114
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.180
<v Speaker 1>I think it is a bad idea.</v>

115
00:04:07.181 --> 00:04:10.390
<v Speaker 1>I also think it makes for an extraordinarily boring lecturer,</v>

116
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:11.141
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

117
00:04:11.141 --> 00:04:13.180
<v Speaker 1>cause you can tell if you're listening to someone,</v>

118
00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.840
<v Speaker 1>whether the idea is that you're hearing are merely being passed through the</v>

119
00:04:16.841 --> 00:04:19.060
<v Speaker 1>person as if they're being memorized,</v>

120
00:04:19.061 --> 00:04:22.900
<v Speaker 1>say or whether they're part of the dynamic core of the person.</v>

121
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.170
<v Speaker 1>And if they're part of the dynamic core of the person,</v>

122
00:04:26.171 --> 00:04:28.600
<v Speaker 1>then they're almost always engaging in gripping.</v>

123
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.110
<v Speaker 1>And so he wasn't a fan of bloodless scholars.</v>

124
00:04:32.111 --> 00:04:35.020
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's correct because one of the things that I see,</v>

125
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.250
<v Speaker 1>it's not a good idea to have ideas possess you</v>

126
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.000
<v Speaker 1>unless you know what the idea is are up to.</v>

127
00:04:43.001 --> 00:04:48.001
<v Speaker 1>And lots of people are possessed by ideas rather than possessing them and not,</v>

128
00:04:48.071 --> 00:04:51.760
<v Speaker 1>what that means is they haven't taken the ideas and integrated them into their</v>

129
00:04:51.761 --> 00:04:52.594
<v Speaker 1>own being.</v>

130
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.033
<v Speaker 1>They haven't,</v>

131
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.350
<v Speaker 1>it's like an incarnation in a sense.</v>

132
00:04:56.351 --> 00:05:01.351
<v Speaker 1>They have an incarnated the ideas in embodied form and so they're incomplete,</v>

133
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:04.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

134
00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.960
<v Speaker 1>nature also in thus spake Zarathustra when Xero Theaster comes down the</v>

135
00:05:07.961 --> 00:05:08.794
<v Speaker 1>mountain,</v>

136
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.220
<v Speaker 1>he sees a bunch of people gathered around a famous individual,</v>

137
00:05:12.221 --> 00:05:14.230
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe a scholar but doesn't really matter.</v>

138
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.070
<v Speaker 1>And when Xero Theaster goes and looks at the person,</v>

139
00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.080
<v Speaker 1>only sees his little tiny midget with the gigantic ear.</v>

140
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.390
<v Speaker 1>And so he's a hyper specialist,</v>

141
00:05:22.391 --> 00:05:22.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

142
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.520
<v Speaker 1>And so he has a pretty impressive year,</v>

143
00:05:24.521 --> 00:05:26.260
<v Speaker 1>but he's only this big.</v>

144
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:27.730
<v Speaker 1>And that was niches,</v>

145
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:28.301
<v Speaker 1>images,</v>

146
00:05:28.301 --> 00:05:32.680
<v Speaker 1>stick commentary on the danger of hyper specialization and also on the danger of</v>

147
00:05:32.681 --> 00:05:34.870
<v Speaker 1>adulation for hyper specialization.</v>

148
00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.320
<v Speaker 1>And cause he thought about it as a kind of deformity.</v>

149
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.371
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

150
00:05:39.371 --> 00:05:40.660
<v Speaker 1>nature was a pretty harsh guy,</v>

151
00:05:40.661 --> 00:05:41.470
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

152
00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:42.303
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

153
00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:49.090
<v Speaker 1>but he did address the issue of the relationship between intellectual knowledge</v>

154
00:05:49.091 --> 00:05:51.580
<v Speaker 1>and an action because for nature,</v>

155
00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.940
<v Speaker 1>those things are not to be separated in some sense.</v>

156
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.320
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

157
00:05:57.321 --> 00:05:58.100
<v Speaker 1>So maybe,</v>

158
00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.933
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why,</v>

159
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.620
<v Speaker 1>maybe it bothered you,</v>

160
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.440
<v Speaker 1>like it's hard to say why it bothered you.</v>

161
00:06:03.441 --> 00:06:07.730
<v Speaker 1>It might have bothered you because it sort of undermine the idea of scholar.</v>

162
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:09.020
<v Speaker 1>But the other possibility,</v>

163
00:06:09.021 --> 00:06:11.990
<v Speaker 1>and this isn't an accusation because obviously I don't know anything about you,</v>

164
00:06:11.991 --> 00:06:14.840
<v Speaker 1>but it might also be that it struck a chord,</v>

165
00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:15.674
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

166
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:20.830
<v Speaker 1>and that maybe you were doubtful or questioning how tightly associated your</v>

167
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.360
<v Speaker 1>intellectual endeavor was with your actual character and your practice.</v>

168
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.700
<v Speaker 1>So that's another possibility.</v>

169
00:06:31.701 --> 00:06:31.881
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

170
00:06:31.881 --> 00:06:34.520
<v Speaker 1>that's a really good thing to think about because generally speaking,</v>

171
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.800
<v Speaker 1>that integration has,</v>

172
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:37.160
<v Speaker 1>is very much lacking.</v>

173
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:42.350
<v Speaker 1>People are a lot smarter and fluid with their ideas than they are ethical and</v>

174
00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:46.130
<v Speaker 1>consistent and characterized by integrity.</v>
