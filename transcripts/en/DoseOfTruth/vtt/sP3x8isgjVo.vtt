00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.420
<v Speaker 1>The moral presuppositions of a culture are instantiated in its stories.</v>

2
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.270
<v Speaker 1>They're not instantiated then it's explicit philosophy.</v>

3
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.140
<v Speaker 1>There might be a layer of explicit philosophy and of course there is in the West</v>

4
00:00:18.141 --> 00:00:19.490
<v Speaker 1>in a layer of explicit law.</v>

5
00:00:19.491 --> 00:00:23.540
<v Speaker 1>But underneath that there are stories and there isn't anything under the stories</v>

6
00:00:23.541 --> 00:00:25.260
<v Speaker 1>except maybe haven,</v>

7
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.791
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8
00:00:25.791 --> 00:00:26.960
<v Speaker 1>and that's so implicit.</v>

9
00:00:26.961 --> 00:00:28.670
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even actually count.</v>

10
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.590
<v Speaker 1>It's not a cognitive operation.</v>

11
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.630
<v Speaker 1>And so this is the story.</v>

12
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.640
<v Speaker 1>These are the stories that are underneath our culture.</v>

13
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.420
<v Speaker 1>And so there better be something to them.</v>

14
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.920
<v Speaker 1>That's what we hope.</v>

15
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.540
<v Speaker 1>And but more importantly maybe we shouldn't toss them away without knowing what</v>

16
00:00:44.541 --> 00:00:44.991
<v Speaker 1>they mean.</v>

17
00:00:44.991 --> 00:00:49.580
<v Speaker 1>Because if we tossed them away then we're throwing everything that we depend on</v>

18
00:00:49.581 --> 00:00:50.930
<v Speaker 1>a way as far as I can tell.</v>

19
00:00:50.931 --> 00:00:51.710
<v Speaker 1>And we will,</v>

20
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:52.760
<v Speaker 1>we will pay for it.</v>

21
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.190
<v Speaker 1>We'll pay for it individually because we'll be weak.</v>

22
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.940
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

23
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.920
<v Speaker 1>Cause if you're not firm in your convictions,</v>

24
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.040
<v Speaker 1>then someone else who's from their convictions can,</v>

25
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.990
<v Speaker 1>you're their puppet like instantly.</v>

26
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.090
<v Speaker 1>And then you're also the puppet of your own doubts,</v>

27
00:01:05.091 --> 00:01:05.361
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

28
00:01:05.361 --> 00:01:07.610
<v Speaker 1>Because unless you have convictions,</v>

29
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.850
<v Speaker 1>you're going to generate doubts like mad cause everyone does.</v>

30
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.200
<v Speaker 1>And then the doubts when,</v>

31
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.720
<v Speaker 1>and you'll be paralyzed because there'll be,</v>

32
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:15.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.230
<v Speaker 1>50% of you moving forward and 50% of you frozen,</v>

34
00:01:18.231 --> 00:01:21.980
<v Speaker 1>stiff and that'll be enough just to lodge you in place.</v>

35
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.293
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

36
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.811
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

37
00:01:26.811 --> 00:01:29.270
<v Speaker 1>so there's a psychologist [inaudible] of the idea of leadership,</v>

38
00:01:29.271 --> 00:01:30.170
<v Speaker 1>which is very important.</v>

39
00:01:30.171 --> 00:01:32.230
<v Speaker 1>And then it's associated with the idea of character,</v>

40
00:01:32.231 --> 00:01:33.170
<v Speaker 1>logical development.</v>

41
00:01:33.171 --> 00:01:35.330
<v Speaker 1>And it's associated with the idea of struggle,</v>

42
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.710
<v Speaker 1>not happiness.</v>

43
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.470
<v Speaker 1>And it's also associated with this Abrahamic idea,</v>

44
00:01:39.471 --> 00:01:40.310
<v Speaker 1>which I really liked.</v>

45
00:01:40.311 --> 00:01:44.390
<v Speaker 1>And which was something that's been very useful to me as a consequence of doing</v>

46
00:01:44.391 --> 00:01:44.930
<v Speaker 1>these lectures.</v>

47
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.200
<v Speaker 1>Because remember at the beginning of the Abrahamic stories,</v>

48
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.970
<v Speaker 1>Abraham's like a stay at home guy,</v>

49
00:01:49.971 --> 00:01:50.181
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

50
00:01:50.181 --> 00:01:52.400
<v Speaker 1>He's like the guy who's 40 years old living in his,</v>

51
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.880
<v Speaker 1>in his,</v>

52
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.160
<v Speaker 1>in his mother's basement and God says like,</v>

53
00:01:55.161 --> 00:01:55.311
<v Speaker 1>get,</v>

54
00:01:55.311 --> 00:01:56.180
<v Speaker 1>get the hell out of there.</v>

55
00:01:56.181 --> 00:01:56.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

56
00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.250
<v Speaker 1>get out in the world where you belong.</v>

57
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.230
<v Speaker 1>Go do something difficult because what you're doing isn't acceptable.</v>

58
00:02:03.231 --> 00:02:03.531
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

59
00:02:03.531 --> 00:02:04.880
<v Speaker 1>the first thing he does is go somewhere,</v>

60
00:02:04.881 --> 00:02:06.080
<v Speaker 1>there's a terrible famine,</v>

61
00:02:06.081 --> 00:02:06.831
<v Speaker 1>and then he goes somewhere.</v>

62
00:02:06.831 --> 00:02:07.670
<v Speaker 1>There's a tyranny.</v>

63
00:02:07.671 --> 00:02:08.420
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

64
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:08.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

65
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:09.030
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

66
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.861
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty funny.</v>

67
00:02:09.861 --> 00:02:14.510
<v Speaker 1>He follows God's call and it's not like sweetness and light and paradise</v>

68
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:15.201
<v Speaker 1>immediately.</v>

69
00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:16.220
<v Speaker 1>It's nothing like that.</v>

70
00:02:16.221 --> 00:02:16.381
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

71
00:02:16.381 --> 00:02:18.860
<v Speaker 1>it's instantaneous combat,</v>

72
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:19.161
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

73
00:02:19.161 --> 00:02:20.930
<v Speaker 1>of the most difficult kind.</v>
