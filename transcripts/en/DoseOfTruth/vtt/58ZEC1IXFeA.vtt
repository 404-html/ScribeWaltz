1
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.250
<v Speaker 1>I've said that some people will tell you that the purpose of life is to be happy</v>

2
00:00:05.251 --> 00:00:09.300
<v Speaker 1>and those people are idiots and was a bit of a rough statement,</v>

3
00:00:09.301 --> 00:00:10.800
<v Speaker 1>but I what I meant by that.</v>

4
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.920
<v Speaker 1>It was actually inspired by a statement by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn who was the</v>

5
00:00:15.991 --> 00:00:20.991
<v Speaker 1>great critic of the Soviet prison system and he commented that happiness is</v>

6
00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:26.400
<v Speaker 1>something that's done in by the first harsh blow that reality deals you and I</v>

7
00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:27.600
<v Speaker 1>believe this to be the case.</v>

8
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.790
<v Speaker 1>There are many circumstances in life where happiness is not only the wrong</v>

9
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.893
<v Speaker 1>response,</v>

10
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.710
<v Speaker 1>but also where the expectation of happiness as a response.</v>

11
00:00:37.711 --> 00:00:39.120
<v Speaker 1>We'll put you,</v>

12
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.500
<v Speaker 1>the person attempting to be happy in absolutely the wrong psychological state.</v>

13
00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:45.330
<v Speaker 1>To be prepared for what must be done.</v>

14
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.060
<v Speaker 1>People are built so to speak,</v>

15
00:00:48.061 --> 00:00:53.061
<v Speaker 1>to experience a very wide range of motivational and emotional states that only</v>

16
00:00:53.311 --> 00:00:55.590
<v Speaker 1>bear a tenuous relationship to one another.</v>

17
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.700
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that the environment that human beings inhabit is so</v>

18
00:00:59.701 --> 00:01:04.701
<v Speaker 1>complex that are adaptation depends on a variety of very finally differentiated</v>

19
00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:06.570
<v Speaker 1>responses.</v>

20
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.950
<v Speaker 1>And so there is a time to be compassionate and there's a time to be aggressive</v>

21
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.330
<v Speaker 1>and there's a time to be in pain and there's a time to be anxious and there's a</v>

22
00:01:15.331 --> 00:01:20.070
<v Speaker 1>time to be joyous and a time to be satisfied and the healthy and well adapted</v>

23
00:01:20.071 --> 00:01:24.930
<v Speaker 1>person has a very wide range of finally differentiated response which cannot be</v>

24
00:01:24.931 --> 00:01:27.780
<v Speaker 1>boiled down to a single dimension.</v>

25
00:01:27.781 --> 00:01:29.790
<v Speaker 1>Say happiness versus unhappiness.</v>

26
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.040
<v Speaker 1>A life is not that simple.</v>

27
00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:32.910
<v Speaker 1>And if it was,</v>

28
00:01:32.911 --> 00:01:34.680
<v Speaker 1>we'd only have one emotional system.</v>

29
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.393
<v Speaker 2>Happiness.</v>

30
00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.410
<v Speaker 2>All it is is it's a barometer.</v>

31
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.230
<v Speaker 2>It's Dr Phil One-on-one.</v>

32
00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.440
<v Speaker 2>Dr Phil always asked,</v>

33
00:01:41.441 --> 00:01:42.550
<v Speaker 2>how are things working for you?</v>

34
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.350
<v Speaker 2>And if you say things are working well,</v>

35
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:45.190
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty.</v>

36
00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.290
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty much what we're meaning by happiness.</v>

37
00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.750
<v Speaker 2>Happiness does not propel us forward.</v>

38
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.110
<v Speaker 2>So it's very weird to meet the objective of your life.</v>

39
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.470
<v Speaker 2>And what I mean by that is while I love being a father,</v>

40
00:01:58.511 --> 00:01:58.870
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>

41
00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.990
<v Speaker 2>I will tell you point blank with my wife listening,</v>

42
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.300
<v Speaker 2>that it has not improved my happiness,</v>

43
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.300
<v Speaker 2>meaning and purpose in life through the roof.</v>

44
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:08.141
<v Speaker 2>Happiness.</v>

45
00:02:08.141 --> 00:02:12.910
<v Speaker 2>I was much happier as a 30 year old having a lot of time with friends and a lot</v>

46
00:02:12.911 --> 00:02:16.660
<v Speaker 2>of time to travel and a lot of time to basically do whatever the hell that I</v>

47
00:02:16.661 --> 00:02:17.494
<v Speaker 2>wanted to,</v>

48
00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.650
<v Speaker 2>so in terms of my happiness is detracted from it.</v>

49
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.600
<v Speaker 2>Are there moments of the most profound pleasure of the most profound</v>

50
00:02:25.601 --> 00:02:30.601
<v Speaker 2>spirituality that I would die for these sacred vessels that I have in my life?</v>

51
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.953
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely,</v>

52
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.430
<v Speaker 2>but that's not happiness,</v>

53
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.700
<v Speaker 2>that's spirituality to me is striving for the sacred and the sacred is things</v>

54
00:02:38.831 --> 00:02:40.810
<v Speaker 2>that you would be willing to die for.</v>

55
00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.381
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

56
00:02:41.381 --> 00:02:44.590
<v Speaker 2>I'd die for a sense of satisfaction in my life.</v>

57
00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.460
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

58
00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.340
<v Speaker 2>What would I be willing to take the bullet over my kids?</v>

59
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.360
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely</v>

60
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.540
<v Speaker 1>making happiness.</v>

61
00:02:51.541 --> 00:02:56.541
<v Speaker 1>The focal point of your life trivializes your experiences because in order to</v>

62
00:02:57.661 --> 00:02:59.190
<v Speaker 1>regard anything as truly,</v>

63
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.550
<v Speaker 3>you also have to regard it's loss as truly meaningful,</v>

64
00:03:03.551 --> 00:03:07.870
<v Speaker 3>and that means that to open yourself up to experiences of deep meaning also</v>

65
00:03:07.871 --> 00:03:12.280
<v Speaker 3>simultaneously means that you have to open yourself up to the possibility of</v>

66
00:03:12.281 --> 00:03:13.780
<v Speaker 3>deep hurt and sorrow</v>

67
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.150
<v Speaker 3>and you do that anytime,</v>

68
00:03:20.151 --> 00:03:20.721
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

69
00:03:20.721 --> 00:03:22.610
<v Speaker 3>that you make a relationship profound.</v>

70
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.360
<v Speaker 3>You put your emotions on the line and that has to be real or the relationship</v>

71
00:03:26.361 --> 00:03:31.361
<v Speaker 3>can't be real and to hope that that sort of risk could be obliterated by the</v>

72
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.010
<v Speaker 3>indulgence in a simplistic form of happiness is to shrink.</v>

73
00:03:38.181 --> 00:03:42.800
<v Speaker 3>I think in cowardess from the demands that real human existence place on people.</v>

74
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.560
<v Speaker 4>This is ideas in Canada on CBC radio,</v>

75
00:03:51.561 --> 00:03:55.250
<v Speaker 4>one across North America on Sirius Satellite Radio,</v>

76
00:03:55.251 --> 00:03:59.180
<v Speaker 4>Channel One 59 and around the world on CBC dot Ca.</v>

77
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.170
<v Speaker 4>I'm Paul Kennedy.</v>

78
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.920
<v Speaker 4>You're listening to CBC,</v>

79
00:04:01.921 --> 00:04:05.280
<v Speaker 4>producer Frank Foulkes say no to happiness.</v>

80
00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.730
<v Speaker 4>The renowned psychiatrist and concentration camp survivor Viktor Frankl wrote</v>

81
00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.960
<v Speaker 4>what man actually needs is not attention list state,</v>

82
00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.320
<v Speaker 4>but rather the striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal of freely chosen</v>

83
00:04:20.511 --> 00:04:21.344
<v Speaker 4>task.</v>

84
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.080
<v Speaker 4>There is much wisdom in the words of Nietzsche.</v>

85
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.720
<v Speaker 4>He has a why to live,</v>

86
00:04:26.721 --> 00:04:29.450
<v Speaker 4>for can bear almost anyhow.</v>

87
00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.450
<v Speaker 4>We now return to frank's documentary,</v>

88
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.920
<v Speaker 4>say no to happiness</v>

89
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:40.800
<v Speaker 3>at every moment.</v>

90
00:04:40.801 --> 00:04:43.860
<v Speaker 3>We're surrounded by what we know and can understand,</v>

91
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.180
<v Speaker 3>but outside of that,</v>

92
00:04:45.181 --> 00:04:48.660
<v Speaker 3>we're surrounded by all the things that we do not know and cannot understand and</v>

93
00:04:48.661 --> 00:04:50.700
<v Speaker 3>that can manifest themselves at any moment.</v>

94
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.150
<v Speaker 3>So we're like small islands of tentative certainty and a massive sea of</v>

95
00:04:58.081 --> 00:04:59.400
<v Speaker 3>uncertainty in ignorance.</v>

96
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.990
<v Speaker 3>That's our existential condition.</v>

97
00:05:03.991 --> 00:05:05.670
<v Speaker 3>It's really our environment.</v>

98
00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.530
<v Speaker 3>Even from a scientific perspective.</v>

99
00:05:07.531 --> 00:05:12.531
<v Speaker 3>It's the environment that we've emerged into and have adapted to and we have to</v>

100
00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.370
<v Speaker 3>take that into account when we deal with our lives because that's the truest</v>

101
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.390
<v Speaker 3>nature of our life.</v>

102
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.450
<v Speaker 3>It's ordering the midst of infinite chaos.</v>

103
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.050
<v Speaker 3>The human problem is how to make sense out of the constant investor play between</v>

104
00:05:27.051 --> 00:05:29.810
<v Speaker 3>that tentative order in that infinite chaos.</v>

105
00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.660
<v Speaker 4>Jordan Peterson is a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto.</v>

106
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.450
<v Speaker 4>He is also the author of maps of meaning,</v>

107
00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:38.980
<v Speaker 4>the architecture of belief.</v>

108
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.080
<v Speaker 4>His book explores how religious and mythological stories shed light on our</v>

109
00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.970
<v Speaker 4>existential predicament and in turn can provide a sense of meaning and purpose.</v>

110
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.700
<v Speaker 4>In the Old Testament in genesis,</v>

111
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.970
<v Speaker 4>it's one of the most profound ideas ever expressed.</v>

112
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.010
<v Speaker 4>The Old Testament God in</v>

113
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.940
<v Speaker 1>generates order out of chaos and upon doing so,</v>

114
00:06:01.941 --> 00:06:02.774
<v Speaker 1>he states,</v>

115
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.600
<v Speaker 1>man and woman are made in my image.</v>

116
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.250
<v Speaker 1>What does he mean by that?</v>

117
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:08.271
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

118
00:06:08.271 --> 00:06:10.610
<v Speaker 1>he dignifies the human soul with that statement,</v>

119
00:06:10.611 --> 00:06:15.611
<v Speaker 1>but the attribution of dignity is based on a psychological and an ontological</v>

120
00:06:16.551 --> 00:06:21.551
<v Speaker 1>reality and that reality is that what the individual consciousness confronts is</v>

121
00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:27.440
<v Speaker 1>equivalent in some sense to the chaos that God originally turned into order at</v>

122
00:06:28.131 --> 00:06:29.060
<v Speaker 1>the beginning of time.</v>

123
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:34.010
<v Speaker 1>In that what you confront moment to moment is the potential of being.</v>

124
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.020
<v Speaker 1>That's what consciousness does.</v>

125
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:41.290
<v Speaker 1>It takes unformed potential and makes it manifest and each human being has the</v>

126
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:46.540
<v Speaker 1>choice about which direction that potential will manifest itself in,</v>

127
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.840
<v Speaker 1>but not about whether or not that manifestation will take place.</v>

128
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:56.050
<v Speaker 1>Because it takes place no matter what and that's why the moral obligation of</v>

129
00:06:56.151 --> 00:06:58.460
<v Speaker 1>existence is incumbent on our being.</v>

130
00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:08.370
<v Speaker 3>Existence implies coexistence to be is to be involved with the life of others.</v>

131
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:15.270
<v Speaker 3>We delude ourselves if we think that we're simply innocent bystanders and life</v>

132
00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:17.680
<v Speaker 3>being is never neutral.</v>

133
00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.870
<v Speaker 3>What we do matters.</v>

134
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:25.980
<v Speaker 3>You can be a creator of things positive or you can be a creator of things</v>

135
00:07:26.621 --> 00:07:30.790
<v Speaker 3>negative or you can be a creator who abdicated their responsibility,</v>

136
00:07:30.791 --> 00:07:32.500
<v Speaker 3>but in all three situations,</v>

137
00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:38.220
<v Speaker 3>you are participating in the process that turns chaos into order and there is no</v>

138
00:07:38.471 --> 00:07:39.304
<v Speaker 3>escaping that.</v>

139
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:44.750
<v Speaker 3>When the high school kids,</v>

140
00:07:44.751 --> 00:07:48.620
<v Speaker 3>the chart up columbine wrote about their philosophy and</v>

141
00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:54.440
<v Speaker 1>the most telling aspect of their philosophy was their judgment of exist in state</v>

142
00:07:55.381 --> 00:07:55.920
<v Speaker 1>and they did.</v>

143
00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.120
<v Speaker 1>You can read this on the net.</v>

144
00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:02.540
<v Speaker 1>Their conclusion at the great age of 19 was that the tragedy of existence was</v>

145
00:08:04.621 --> 00:08:08.280
<v Speaker 1>such that being itself was corrupt.</v>

146
00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:12.930
<v Speaker 1>That because people suffered and because of the world was a dangerous and</v>

147
00:08:12.931 --> 00:08:13.770
<v Speaker 1>terrible place.</v>

148
00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:17.730
<v Speaker 1>That being itself should be eradicated and this is a very common judgment,</v>

149
00:08:17.731 --> 00:08:19.410
<v Speaker 1>is far more common than people think.</v>

150
00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:25.010
<v Speaker 1>And once you forego the luxury of deciding in a sense to hell with everything</v>

151
00:08:28.231 --> 00:08:32.160
<v Speaker 1>that that everything is so corrupt that it's unredeemable,</v>

152
00:08:32.161 --> 00:08:33.600
<v Speaker 1>once you forego that luxury,</v>

153
00:08:33.601 --> 00:08:38.601
<v Speaker 1>then it becomes incumbent on you to try to work for the betterment of being in</v>

154
00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:43.200
<v Speaker 1>that requires faith and and the reason it requires faith is because a,</v>

155
00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.600
<v Speaker 1>you don't know if being can be bettered,</v>

156
00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:46.493
<v Speaker 1>and B,</v>

157
00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:48.600
<v Speaker 1>you don't know if you're the creature to do it,</v>

158
00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:52.890
<v Speaker 1>but the peculiar thing is is that you will never find out if being can be</v>

159
00:08:52.891 --> 00:08:55.020
<v Speaker 1>bettered or if you're the creature to do it,</v>

160
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:56.160
<v Speaker 1>until you assume</v>

161
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.640
<v Speaker 3>that it can be bettered and you assume that you are that creature to do it.</v>

162
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:03.900
<v Speaker 3>Critics of religious thinking believed that what faith means is the willingness</v>

163
00:09:03.901 --> 00:09:08.070
<v Speaker 3>to suspend rational judgment and swallow any old thing.</v>

164
00:09:08.071 --> 00:09:10.110
<v Speaker 3>No matter how absurd.</v>

165
00:09:10.111 --> 00:09:11.850
<v Speaker 3>And that's not what faith means at all.</v>

166
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:16.880
<v Speaker 3>What faith means is the willingness to put yourself on the line in pursuit of</v>

167
00:09:17.011 --> 00:09:19.320
<v Speaker 3>those things that you find deeply meaningful.</v>

168
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:23.700
<v Speaker 3>And that's why so many great philosophers such as Soren kierkegaard emphasize</v>

169
00:09:23.701 --> 00:09:26.430
<v Speaker 3>above all the role that faith plays.</v>

170
00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:38.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm a clinical psychologist.</v>

171
00:09:38.621 --> 00:09:39.890
<v Speaker 3>I have an active practice,</v>

172
00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:45.210
<v Speaker 3>20 clients and I see them weekly and I'm a professor of psychology at the</v>

173
00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.460
<v Speaker 3>University of Toronto and so it might be surprising that I use religious</v>

174
00:09:48.461 --> 00:09:48.881
<v Speaker 3>language,</v>

175
00:09:48.881 --> 00:09:53.881
<v Speaker 3>but it's not surprising because as soon as you start to talk about the deepest</v>

176
00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:55.300
<v Speaker 3>meanings of life,</v>

177
00:09:56.380 --> 00:10:00.370
<v Speaker 3>the language that is most appropriate is immediately religious and the reason</v>

178
00:10:00.371 --> 00:10:05.170
<v Speaker 3>for that is that religion is precisely that element of human existence that</v>

179
00:10:05.171 --> 00:10:08.530
<v Speaker 3>deals with the most profound elements of human being.</v>

180
00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:14.630
<v Speaker 3>I believe that the reason for this is this,</v>

181
00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.280
<v Speaker 3>in some sense,</v>

182
00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:21.580
<v Speaker 3>human existence is so contradictory that it's in in a manner technically</v>

183
00:10:22.041 --> 00:10:22.874
<v Speaker 3>impossible.</v>

184
00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:28.240
<v Speaker 3>We're limited creatures and we face unlimited catastrophe in in that everything</v>

185
00:10:28.911 --> 00:10:32.300
<v Speaker 3>we know will disappear and everyone we love will die.</v>

186
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:35.810
<v Speaker 3>And so that makes existence.</v>

187
00:10:35.811 --> 00:10:38.570
<v Speaker 3>Human existence in a sense existentially impossible,</v>

188
00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:43.840
<v Speaker 3>but the religious impulse combats that in a sense because the religious impulse</v>

189
00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:49.810
<v Speaker 3>opens up to the human being the possibility that there is sufficient absolute</v>

190
00:10:50.001 --> 00:10:55.001
<v Speaker 3>within to serve as an antidote to the absolute without and the notion that it's</v>

191
00:10:57.081 --> 00:11:00.350
<v Speaker 3>necessary to have an individual relationship with the absolute.</v>

192
00:11:00.351 --> 00:11:00.891
<v Speaker 3>With God,</v>

193
00:11:00.891 --> 00:11:01.551
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

194
00:11:01.551 --> 00:11:06.551
<v Speaker 3>is a statement of the fact that we are in fact adapted to the nature of reality,</v>

195
00:11:07.461 --> 00:11:11.660
<v Speaker 3>and if we draw on everything that is within ourselves without fear,</v>

196
00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:16.400
<v Speaker 3>then we can develop the sorts of personalities that are powerful enough to</v>

197
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:21.430
<v Speaker 3>confront the horrible absolute and to consider that justifiable and worthwhile.</v>

198
00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.460
<v Speaker 5>I want to put it in a good word coming from the Jewish tradition,</v>

199
00:11:33.461 --> 00:11:35.170
<v Speaker 5>a good word for happiness.</v>

200
00:11:35.171 --> 00:11:35.460
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

201
00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:35.690
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

202
00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:40.390
<v Speaker 5>it's striking to me that the very first word in the first verse of the First</v>

203
00:11:40.391 --> 00:11:44.650
<v Speaker 5>Chapter of the Book of Psalms is a word that is probably best translated as</v>

204
00:11:44.651 --> 00:11:45.220
<v Speaker 5>happy,</v>

205
00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:49.720
<v Speaker 5>so it says in Psalms happy is the one who does not stand in the way of the</v>

206
00:11:49.721 --> 00:11:54.721
<v Speaker 5>wicked or walk with sinners or sit in the company of but whose delight is in the</v>

207
00:11:55.151 --> 00:11:57.910
<v Speaker 5>law of the Lord in God's law.</v>

208
00:11:57.911 --> 00:11:59.380
<v Speaker 5>Does he meditate day and night?</v>

209
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.040
<v Speaker 5>Happiness is a,</v>

210
00:12:01.041 --> 00:12:03.070
<v Speaker 5>I think a not a bad thing.</v>

211
00:12:03.071 --> 00:12:05.170
<v Speaker 5>It's certainly better than its opposite,</v>

212
00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:05.860
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

213
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:09.670
<v Speaker 5>but clearly it is inadequate as a goal for our lives.</v>

214
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:11.500
<v Speaker 5>If that's all that we can aspire to,</v>

215
00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.750
<v Speaker 5>then our lives to become trivial,</v>

216
00:12:13.751 --> 00:12:15.310
<v Speaker 5>then they become insignificant.</v>

217
00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:20.170
<v Speaker 5>The happiest creature in the world I think is a lizard sitting in the sun,</v>

218
00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.140
<v Speaker 5>and if all we want to be or lizards sitting in the sun,</v>

219
00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:27.640
<v Speaker 5>it won't work for us because we have an awareness that lizards don't have.</v>

220
00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:31.000
<v Speaker 5>We have an awareness that there is something greater than ourselves,</v>

221
00:12:31.001 --> 00:12:32.110
<v Speaker 5>greater than our material,</v>

222
00:12:32.111 --> 00:12:34.690
<v Speaker 5>corporeal being that there is the infinite.</v>

223
00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:38.920
<v Speaker 5>Dan Polish is the author of talking about God,</v>

224
00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:44.220
<v Speaker 5>exploring the meaning of religious life with regard boober Tillich and Heschel</v>

225
00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:46.810
<v Speaker 5>in his book,</v>

226
00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:47.890
<v Speaker 5>Polish explorers.</v>

227
00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:53.040
<v Speaker 5>How each of these thinkers understand the human encounter with the infinite.</v>

228
00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:58.990
<v Speaker 5>The Danish Christian philosopher Soren Kierkegaard coined the term anxious or</v>

229
00:12:58.991 --> 00:13:03.991
<v Speaker 5>anxiety to describe our experience as limited beings overwhelmed by the</v>

230
00:13:04.721 --> 00:13:05.554
<v Speaker 5>infinite.</v>

231
00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:06.760
<v Speaker 5>Paul Tillich,</v>

232
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:11.380
<v Speaker 5>a Christian theologian talked about the courage to be in the face of our</v>

233
00:13:11.381 --> 00:13:12.670
<v Speaker 5>existential predicament.</v>

234
00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:14.440
<v Speaker 5>The Jewish theologian,</v>

235
00:13:14.441 --> 00:13:18.550
<v Speaker 5>Martin Buber talked about the importance of holding ourselves open to the</v>

236
00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:23.170
<v Speaker 5>unconditional mystery that we encounter in every sphere of our life.</v>

237
00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:28.830
<v Speaker 5>Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel spoke of knowing life has ultimate meaning.</v>

238
00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:32.650
<v Speaker 5>Though we can never fully comprehend that meaning only sense it,</v>

239
00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:36.850
<v Speaker 5>all of them could be characterized is existentialist thinkers,</v>

240
00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:42.240
<v Speaker 5>by which I mean that they like other existentialists recognize that as</v>

241
00:13:42.731 --> 00:13:43.421
<v Speaker 5>Shakespeare said,</v>

242
00:13:43.421 --> 00:13:46.330
<v Speaker 5>there's more in heaven and earth than there is in your philosophy of ratio.</v>

243
00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:48.640
<v Speaker 5>They don't focus on creating theories.</v>

244
00:13:48.641 --> 00:13:52.810
<v Speaker 5>They know that the mind can go only so far so they don't start with theory.</v>

245
00:13:52.811 --> 00:13:56.170
<v Speaker 5>They start with a with human experience it religiously.</v>

246
00:13:56.171 --> 00:14:01.171
<v Speaker 5>That means that they are less interested in talking about what God is a then it</v>

247
00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:07.790
<v Speaker 5>talking about how we human beings respond to God rather than trying to define</v>

248
00:14:07.811 --> 00:14:12.600
<v Speaker 5>that which they recognize ultimately as beyond the capacity for human beings do</v>

249
00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:17.610
<v Speaker 5>either define or even understand and that unless we find a way of living</v>

250
00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:22.660
<v Speaker 5>constructively with the infinite are living in the infinite.</v>

251
00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:27.790
<v Speaker 5>Unless we find the courage to have faith in that which we cannot begin to</v>

252
00:14:27.791 --> 00:14:29.980
<v Speaker 5>understand or begin to articulate a,</v>

253
00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:33.280
<v Speaker 5>then we're then we're going to suffer what kierkegaard called [inaudible].</v>

254
00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:34.990
<v Speaker 5>We're going to suffer that anxiety.</v>

255
00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:39.460
<v Speaker 5>Character guard by all accounts was not a happy fellow.</v>

256
00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:44.350
<v Speaker 5>He suffered a major romantic disappointment as a young man and eventually</v>

257
00:14:44.351 --> 00:14:49.351
<v Speaker 5>retreated into a solitary life of study and writing when it came to achieving</v>

258
00:14:49.931 --> 00:14:51.070
<v Speaker 5>happiness in this life.</v>

259
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:51.980
<v Speaker 5>He didn't</v>

260
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.210
<v Speaker 2>believe it was possible.</v>

261
00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:58.960
<v Speaker 2>The best we can do is aspire to diminish the anx that defines human</v>

262
00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:00.483
<v Speaker 5>existence.</v>

263
00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:02.230
<v Speaker 5>As for the other three,</v>

264
00:15:02.231 --> 00:15:06.220
<v Speaker 5>the who lived in the 20th century that that I've written about his show,</v>

265
00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:07.213
<v Speaker 5>Uber Tilak,</v>

266
00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:12.630
<v Speaker 5>all three of them knew a great deal of suffering in their lives so that the idea</v>

267
00:15:13.571 --> 00:15:15.430
<v Speaker 5>of happiness being something paramount,</v>

268
00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:17.380
<v Speaker 5>I think we'd look ridiculous to them.</v>

269
00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:22.680
<v Speaker 5>All three of them were forced to leave Germany and Europe when it fell under</v>

270
00:15:24.191 --> 00:15:25.690
<v Speaker 5>Nazi domination.</v>

271
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:26.680
<v Speaker 5>Heschel,</v>

272
00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:27.490
<v Speaker 5>of course,</v>

273
00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:32.490
<v Speaker 5>came to the United States before the full horrors of the Nazi reality acted</v>

274
00:15:33.221 --> 00:15:35.020
<v Speaker 5>itself out in Europe.</v>

275
00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.030
<v Speaker 5>He was living in Cincinnati,</v>

276
00:15:37.031 --> 00:15:41.890
<v Speaker 5>Ohio when he got word that his whole family had been exterminated.</v>

277
00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:48.100
<v Speaker 1>I've said that some people will tell you that the purpose of life is to be happy</v>

278
00:15:48.241 --> 00:15:49.890
<v Speaker 1>and those people are idiots,</v>

279
00:15:49.891 --> 00:15:52.290
<v Speaker 1>and it was a bit of a rough statement,</v>

280
00:15:52.291 --> 00:15:52.830
<v Speaker 1>but I.</v>

281
00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:53.820
<v Speaker 1>What I meant by that,</v>

282
00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:58.910
<v Speaker 1>it was actually inspired by a statement by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn who was the</v>

283
00:15:58.981 --> 00:16:03.981
<v Speaker 1>great critic of the Soviet prison system and he commented that happiness is</v>

284
00:16:04.441 --> 00:16:09.090
<v Speaker 1>something that's done in by the first harsh blow that reality deals you and and</v>

285
00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:10.620
<v Speaker 1>and I believe this to be the case.</v>

286
00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:15.780
<v Speaker 1>There are many circumstances in life where happiness is not only the wrong</v>

287
00:16:16.051 --> 00:16:16.890
<v Speaker 1>response,</v>

288
00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:20.700
<v Speaker 1>but also where the expectation of happiness as a response.</v>

289
00:16:20.701 --> 00:16:22.140
<v Speaker 1>We'll put you,</v>

290
00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:26.490
<v Speaker 1>the person attempting to be happy in absolutely the wrong psychological state.</v>

291
00:16:26.491 --> 00:16:28.320
<v Speaker 1>To be prepared for what must be done.</v>

292
00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:31.050
<v Speaker 1>People are built so to speak,</v>

293
00:16:31.051 --> 00:16:36.051
<v Speaker 1>to experience a very wide range of motivational and emotional states that only</v>

294
00:16:36.301 --> 00:16:38.610
<v Speaker 1>bear a tenuous relationship to one another.</v>

295
00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:42.690
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that the environment that human beings inhabit is so</v>

296
00:16:42.691 --> 00:16:47.691
<v Speaker 1>complex that are app patient depends on a variety of very finally differentiated</v>

297
00:16:48.751 --> 00:16:49.584
<v Speaker 1>responses.</v>

298
00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:54.000
<v Speaker 1>And so there is a time to be compassionate and there's a time to be aggressive</v>

299
00:16:54.001 --> 00:16:58.320
<v Speaker 1>and there's a time to be in pain and there's a time to be anxious and there's a</v>

300
00:16:58.321 --> 00:17:03.321
<v Speaker 1>time to be joyous and a time to be satisfied and healthy and well adapted person</v>

301
00:17:03.541 --> 00:17:08.340
<v Speaker 1>has a very wide range of finally differentiated response which cannot be boiled</v>

302
00:17:08.341 --> 00:17:10.770
<v Speaker 1>down to a single dimension.</v>

303
00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.780
<v Speaker 1>Say happiness versus unhappiness.</v>

304
00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:15.040
<v Speaker 1>A life is not that simple.</v>

305
00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:15.901
<v Speaker 1>If it was,</v>

306
00:17:15.901 --> 00:17:17.670
<v Speaker 1>we'd only have one emotional system.</v>

307
00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:19.383
<v Speaker 2>Happiness.</v>

308
00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:21.430
<v Speaker 2>All it is is it's a barometer.</v>

309
00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.250
<v Speaker 2>It's Dr Phil One-on-one.</v>

310
00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:24.450
<v Speaker 2>Dr Phil always asked,</v>

311
00:17:24.451 --> 00:17:25.570
<v Speaker 2>how are things working for you?</v>

312
00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:27.340
<v Speaker 2>And if you say things are working well,</v>

313
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:28.130
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty.</v>

314
00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:30.280
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty much what we mean by happiness.</v>

315
00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:32.740
<v Speaker 2>Happiness does not propel us forward.</v>

316
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:34.690
<v Speaker 2>So it's very weird to meet this,</v>

317
00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.100
<v Speaker 2>the objective of your life.</v>

318
00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:41.490
<v Speaker 2>And what I mean by that is while I love being a father,</v>

319
00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:45.010
<v Speaker 2>I will tell you point blank with my wife listening,</v>

320
00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:47.320
<v Speaker 2>that it has not improved my happiness,</v>

321
00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:50.310
<v Speaker 2>meaning and purpose in life through the roof.</v>

322
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:51.121
<v Speaker 2>Happiness.</v>

323
00:17:51.121 --> 00:17:55.920
<v Speaker 2>I was much happier as a 30 year old having a lot of time with friends and a lot</v>

324
00:17:55.921 --> 00:17:59.670
<v Speaker 2>of time to travel and a lot of time to basically do whatever the hell that I</v>

325
00:17:59.671 --> 00:18:00.504
<v Speaker 2>wanted to,</v>

326
00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:02.430
<v Speaker 2>so in terms of my happiness,</v>

327
00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:03.660
<v Speaker 2>it's detracted from it.</v>

328
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:08.610
<v Speaker 2>Are there moments of the most profound pleasure of the most profound</v>

329
00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:13.620
<v Speaker 2>spirituality that I would die for these sacred vessels that I have in my life?</v>

330
00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:14.963
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely,</v>

331
00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:16.440
<v Speaker 2>but that's not happiness,</v>

332
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:21.710
<v Speaker 2>that's spirituality to me is striving for the sacred and the secret is things</v>

333
00:18:21.811 --> 00:18:26.811
<v Speaker 2>that you would be willing to die for what I die for a sense of satisfaction in</v>

334
00:18:27.181 --> 00:18:27.630
<v Speaker 2>my life.</v>

335
00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:28.440
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

336
00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.320
<v Speaker 2>what would I be willing to take the bullet over my kids?</v>

337
00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:32.340
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely</v>

338
00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:34.510
<v Speaker 3>making happiness.</v>

339
00:18:34.511 --> 00:18:39.511
<v Speaker 3>The focal point of your life trivializes your experiences because in order to</v>

340
00:18:40.661 --> 00:18:42.880
<v Speaker 3>regard anything as truly important,</v>

341
00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:46.540
<v Speaker 3>you also have to regard it's loss as truly meaningful,</v>

342
00:18:46.541 --> 00:18:50.890
<v Speaker 3>and that means that to open yourself up to experiences of deep meaning also</v>

343
00:18:50.891 --> 00:18:55.270
<v Speaker 3>simultaneously means that you have to open yourself up to the possibility of</v>

344
00:18:55.271 --> 00:18:56.800
<v Speaker 3>deep hurt and sorrow</v>

345
00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:03.150
<v Speaker 3>and you do that anytime,</v>

346
00:19:03.151 --> 00:19:03.721
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

347
00:19:03.721 --> 00:19:05.610
<v Speaker 3>that you make a relationship profound.</v>

348
00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:09.330
<v Speaker 3>You put your emotions on the line and that has to be real or the relationship</v>

349
00:19:09.331 --> 00:19:14.331
<v Speaker 3>can't be real and to hope that that sort of risk could be obliterated by the</v>

350
00:19:16.051 --> 00:19:21.051
<v Speaker 3>indulgence in a simplistic form of happiness is to shrink.</v>

351
00:19:21.181 --> 00:19:25.860
<v Speaker 3>I think in cowardess from the demands that real human existence place on people.</v>

352
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:34.550
<v Speaker 4>This is ideas in Canada on CBC radio,</v>

353
00:19:34.551 --> 00:19:39.551
<v Speaker 4>one across North America on Sirius Satellite Radio Channel One 59 and around the</v>

354
00:19:40.281 --> 00:19:42.170
<v Speaker 4>world on CBC dot Ca.</v>

355
00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:43.190
<v Speaker 4>I'm Paul Kennedy.</v>

356
00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:44.930
<v Speaker 4>You're listening to CBC,</v>

357
00:19:44.931 --> 00:19:48.320
<v Speaker 4>producer Frank fulks say no to happiness.</v>

358
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.450
<v Speaker 4>The renowned psychiatrist in concentration camp survivor,</v>

359
00:19:52.451 --> 00:19:57.320
<v Speaker 4>Viktor Frankl wrote what man actually needs is not a tension</v>

360
00:19:57.470 --> 00:20:02.470
<v Speaker 5>duration of for us to live in ways that transcend simple selfishness,</v>

361
00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:06.020
<v Speaker 5>simple egocentricity,</v>

362
00:20:06.021 --> 00:20:07.700
<v Speaker 5>simple focusing on ourselves.</v>

363
00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.910
<v Speaker 5>Ryan hold neighbor who was actually a very close friend of Heschel,</v>

364
00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:16.240
<v Speaker 5>said that life has no meaning except in terms of responsibility.</v>

365
00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:19.460
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure how she would he would shake his head absolutely.</v>

366
00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:29.900
<v Speaker 5>One of Heschel's earliest books is called the image of God in this world.</v>

367
00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.193
<v Speaker 5>Humanity.</v>

368
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:34.200
<v Speaker 5>Human beings are God's image in this world.</v>

369
00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:40.220
<v Speaker 5>Our goal in life is very clear to be in this world what we would want God to be</v>

370
00:20:40.291 --> 00:20:41.124
<v Speaker 5>in this world,</v>

371
00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:51.170
<v Speaker 6>for us to our actions and our behaviors and our engagements,</v>

372
00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:53.830
<v Speaker 6>to manifest God in the world,</v>

373
00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:59.730
<v Speaker 6>to be radically discontent with the things that exist in this world,</v>

374
00:20:59.731 --> 00:21:03.990
<v Speaker 6>to be radically discontent with the social evils that we see around us.</v>

375
00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:08.810
<v Speaker 6>Do what we can to write them</v>

376
00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:14.630
<v Speaker 6>because we are God's own self is at work in this world,</v>

377
00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:21.090
<v Speaker 6>which actually would say means where we finally become the most human.</v>

378
00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:40.140
<v Speaker 2>I've gotten very interested in the psychology of morality because we often push</v>

379
00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:44.800
<v Speaker 2>it aside to just religious teachings,</v>

380
00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:45.820
<v Speaker 2>religious ideas,</v>

381
00:21:45.821 --> 00:21:48.820
<v Speaker 2>and when we're making moral decisions on a daily basis,</v>

382
00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:53.680
<v Speaker 2>and it makes me think of exemplars of people that have profound meaning and</v>

383
00:21:53.681 --> 00:21:54.520
<v Speaker 2>purpose in life,</v>

384
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.830
<v Speaker 2>but are probably average to below average on happiness and Martin Luther King</v>

385
00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:02.620
<v Speaker 2>happens to be a real great example of this.</v>

386
00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:07.870
<v Speaker 2>Todd Cashton is associate professor of psychology at George Mason University in</v>

387
00:22:07.871 --> 00:22:08.704
<v Speaker 2>Virginia.</v>

388
00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:12.280
<v Speaker 2>He is the author of designing positive psychology,</v>

389
00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:14.680
<v Speaker 2>a book on the science of wellbeing.</v>

390
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:19.750
<v Speaker 2>Professor cashton regularly gives talks and workshops on how to live a</v>

391
00:22:19.751 --> 00:22:22.060
<v Speaker 2>worthwhile and meaningful life.</v>

392
00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:27.600
<v Speaker 2>This is someone in context who had extreme righteous indignation.</v>

393
00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:30.221
<v Speaker 2>This is a,</v>

394
00:22:30.221 --> 00:22:32.350
<v Speaker 2>this is just a manifestation of anger,</v>

395
00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:34.420
<v Speaker 2>of the mistreatment of other,</v>

396
00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:38.110
<v Speaker 2>of other fellow human beings on the lack of equality and fairness.</v>

397
00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:42.670
<v Speaker 2>These are fundamental moral principles and his life was devoted to this.</v>

398
00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:43.360
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

399
00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:48.360
<v Speaker 2>if you're talking about pursuing goals that are outside the parameters of</v>

400
00:22:49.781 --> 00:22:50.614
<v Speaker 2>happiness,</v>

401
00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:52.240
<v Speaker 2>look to Martin Luther King,</v>

402
00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:57.160
<v Speaker 2>the idea of absorbing the blues,</v>

403
00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:58.180
<v Speaker 2>the hatred,</v>

404
00:22:58.510 --> 00:22:59.343
<v Speaker 2>the prejudice,</v>

405
00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:03.970
<v Speaker 2>the discrimination for other people to make a point that these,</v>

406
00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:09.270
<v Speaker 2>these behaviors are not indicative of what a good society is built on,</v>

407
00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:12.910
<v Speaker 2>and Martin Luther King is not the only person.</v>

408
00:23:12.911 --> 00:23:15.790
<v Speaker 2>He just happens to be a public exemplar.</v>

409
00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:20.470
<v Speaker 2>You have people in schools right here in DC where I'm sitting right now who are</v>

410
00:23:20.471 --> 00:23:22.660
<v Speaker 2>devoting themselves in inner city kids.</v>

411
00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:26.920
<v Speaker 2>You've got teachers that are creating a safe space for them,</v>

412
00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:31.660
<v Speaker 2>a place where they can actually learn and grow and become a moral outstanding</v>

413
00:23:31.661 --> 00:23:32.494
<v Speaker 2>citizen.</v>

414
00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:37.560
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about people that are taking time away from their own happiness to</v>

415
00:23:37.901 --> 00:23:42.340
<v Speaker 2>do something that really matters and but lead to a sense of morality,</v>

416
00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:44.650
<v Speaker 2>meaning and purpose in life.</v>

417
00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:47.210
<v Speaker 2>They just don't fit on the same spectrum.</v>

418
00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:47.601
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

419
00:23:47.601 --> 00:23:52.601
<v Speaker 2>there are multiple pathways to living a good life and I think a better approach</v>

420
00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:57.650
<v Speaker 2>than having happiness as the ultimate end point is to do things you care about.</v>

421
00:23:58.010 --> 00:23:59.450
<v Speaker 2>We're not talking about happiness.</v>

422
00:23:59.451 --> 00:24:01.040
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about engagement.</v>

423
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:03.170
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about meaningful pursuits.</v>

424
00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:08.910
<v Speaker 1>Nothing can drive you to find the deepest meanings of life without first</v>

425
00:24:10.541 --> 00:24:15.280
<v Speaker 1>realizing the absolute fragility of life because there's nothing that's</v>

426
00:24:15.281 --> 00:24:20.281
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently terrifying as realization of that absolute fragility and it's</v>

427
00:24:21.011 --> 00:24:26.011
<v Speaker 1>necessary to be profoundly terrified before you can be motivated to seek out</v>

428
00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:31.750
<v Speaker 1>those things that are of the highest value as a consequence of considering these</v>

429
00:24:31.751 --> 00:24:36.751
<v Speaker 1>ideas for many years and especially considering the role that evil has played,</v>

430
00:24:37.031 --> 00:24:40.570
<v Speaker 1>say in the 20th century and also the role that suffering plays in life.</v>

431
00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:46.230
<v Speaker 1>I've asked myself deeply what the purpose of life might be and and it seems to</v>

432
00:24:46.841 --> 00:24:51.340
<v Speaker 1>me that life requires virtue and so then you might ask,</v>

433
00:24:51.341 --> 00:24:51.521
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

434
00:24:51.521 --> 00:24:52.930
<v Speaker 1>what do I mean by virtue?</v>

435
00:24:52.931 --> 00:24:57.931
<v Speaker 1>And what I mean by virtue is following whatever it is in your life that</v>

436
00:24:59.621 --> 00:25:03.730
<v Speaker 1>manifests itself to you as meaningful and right.</v>

437
00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:06.550
<v Speaker 1>And there's quota sales to that.</v>

438
00:25:06.551 --> 00:25:07.241
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

439
00:25:07.241 --> 00:25:09.820
<v Speaker 1>in order to determine clearly what's meaningful and right,</v>

440
00:25:09.821 --> 00:25:13.600
<v Speaker 1>you have to stop light because if you lie to yourself or you lie to other</v>

441
00:25:13.601 --> 00:25:14.434
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

442
00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:19.000
<v Speaker 1>you blind yourself and then the things that might appear to you as meaningful</v>

443
00:25:19.001 --> 00:25:23.200
<v Speaker 1>are no longer trustworthy because you're using an instrument that you</v>

444
00:25:23.201 --> 00:25:28.201
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily damaged to perceive reality and that will lead you astray and virtue</v>

445
00:25:28.601 --> 00:25:33.601
<v Speaker 1>requires well requires humility because you have to stop thinking that you know,</v>

446
00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:37.900
<v Speaker 1>and so humility and honesty are absolute preconditions.</v>

447
00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:41.950
<v Speaker 1>Courage as well as necessary because you will have to learn to come to terms</v>

448
00:25:41.951 --> 00:25:46.540
<v Speaker 1>with your own capacity for anxiety and dread and aggression and the and even</v>

449
00:25:46.541 --> 00:25:48.780
<v Speaker 1>your capacity for welfare,</v>

450
00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:49.840
<v Speaker 1>terrible acts,</v>

451
00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:55.260
<v Speaker 1>and to continually set yourself right is to walk down the path I believe of</v>

452
00:25:55.631 --> 00:25:56.464
<v Speaker 1>moral virtue.</v>

453
00:25:57.170 --> 00:26:02.170
<v Speaker 2>I would contrast the difference between having happiness as a desirable thing,</v>

454
00:26:02.511 --> 00:26:04.970
<v Speaker 2>which it's incredibly desirable to be happy,</v>

455
00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:10.240
<v Speaker 2>but what I like to talk about is thinking about this as a compass provided</v>

456
00:26:11.051 --> 00:26:13.400
<v Speaker 2>navigator of which direction to go into.</v>

457
00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:15.650
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't tell them what direction it says,</v>

458
00:26:15.651 --> 00:26:17.120
<v Speaker 2>here's the direction that you're facing.</v>

459
00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:22.280
<v Speaker 2>If happiness is your compass to navigate through the complexities and</v>

460
00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:23.810
<v Speaker 2>ambiguities of life,</v>

461
00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:28.490
<v Speaker 2>it means when something is negative or problematic,</v>

462
00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:30.740
<v Speaker 2>that's the wrong direction to move into.</v>

463
00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:34.850
<v Speaker 2>When it's your values become your compass,</v>

464
00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:35.990
<v Speaker 2>it's very different.</v>

465
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:37.310
<v Speaker 2>Let me give you example,</v>

466
00:26:37.311 --> 00:26:38.900
<v Speaker 2>so one of my fundamental values,</v>

467
00:26:38.901 --> 00:26:41.000
<v Speaker 2>I have twin four year old girls,</v>

468
00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:45.630
<v Speaker 2>is to try to be a good father and instill good values in them and try to</v>

469
00:26:45.631 --> 00:26:49.650
<v Speaker 2>cultivate their strikes and so when I'm faced with conflicts,</v>

470
00:26:49.651 --> 00:26:51.120
<v Speaker 2>which we all are faced with,</v>

471
00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:53.310
<v Speaker 2>I love writing.</v>

472
00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:54.660
<v Speaker 2>I love doing science.</v>

473
00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:58.140
<v Speaker 2>I loved teaching and I'm in the middle of a great writing session.</v>

474
00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:58.951
<v Speaker 2>Eight hours,</v>

475
00:26:58.951 --> 00:27:03.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm in flow of the words were just spilling out of my brain onto the page and I</v>

476
00:27:03.091 --> 00:27:05.880
<v Speaker 2>look at the clock and I realized it's almost time for their bedtime.</v>

477
00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:07.440
<v Speaker 2>I've got a conflict here.</v>

478
00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:12.090
<v Speaker 2>Do I continue with this incredible writing session or do I make sure I've seen</v>

479
00:27:12.091 --> 00:27:13.770
<v Speaker 2>my kids before I go to sleep,</v>

480
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:15.300
<v Speaker 2>read them a story,</v>

481
00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:16.313
<v Speaker 2>tuck them in,</v>

482
00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:17.940
<v Speaker 2>showed them some affection,</v>

483
00:27:17.941 --> 00:27:19.110
<v Speaker 2>and maybe come back to this.</v>

484
00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:19.681
<v Speaker 2>Am I writing?</v>

485
00:27:19.681 --> 00:27:24.330
<v Speaker 2>Might not be as good afterwards knowing that my values are to trying to be a</v>

486
00:27:24.331 --> 00:27:29.331
<v Speaker 2>good father and instill values in them helps me with the decision and it helps</v>

487
00:27:29.821 --> 00:27:31.440
<v Speaker 2>them decide if know what I'm going to go home,</v>

488
00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:33.780
<v Speaker 2>spend some time with my children,</v>

489
00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:35.190
<v Speaker 2>come back to my work.</v>

490
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:37.230
<v Speaker 2>If happiness is my objective,</v>

491
00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:42.500
<v Speaker 2>it leaves me in a much bigger quandary of all of these conflicts of what do I do</v>

492
00:27:42.661 --> 00:27:46.880
<v Speaker 2>with the limited amount of time and energy I have in any given day and all of</v>

493
00:27:46.881 --> 00:27:50.070
<v Speaker 2>these competing things that are fighting for my attention,</v>

494
00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:55.500
<v Speaker 2>meaning and purpose in life and values is a very stable compass.</v>

495
00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:57.540
<v Speaker 2>This is a way to create a life,</v>

496
00:27:57.541 --> 00:27:59.730
<v Speaker 2>to feel good about who we are,</v>

497
00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:04.710
<v Speaker 2>to have an understanding of what type of person we want to be and try to close</v>

498
00:28:04.711 --> 00:28:07.830
<v Speaker 2>the gap between what we do and what we strive to become.</v>

499
00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:13.380
<v Speaker 2>I want to make my personal signature on my work so that I leave the world a</v>

500
00:28:13.381 --> 00:28:14.820
<v Speaker 2>little bit of a better place.</v>

501
00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:18.070
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

502
00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:27.570
<v Speaker 3>There's an old idea of deeply embedded,</v>

503
00:28:27.571 --> 00:28:32.340
<v Speaker 3>again in western religious thinking that reality is in some sense,</v>

504
00:28:32.341 --> 00:28:33.174
<v Speaker 3>incomplete,</v>

505
00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:34.890
<v Speaker 3>unfinished or broken,</v>

506
00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:39.300
<v Speaker 3>and that the role of the human being is to complete it,</v>

507
00:28:39.301 --> 00:28:40.140
<v Speaker 3>to perfect it,</v>

508
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:45.230
<v Speaker 3>to finish it and see the idea that reality is in some sense unfinished and hence</v>

509
00:28:47.131 --> 00:28:49.320
<v Speaker 3>it's tragic and incomplete manner,</v>

510
00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:54.150
<v Speaker 3>and that the role of the human being is in some sense to participate in its</v>

511
00:28:54.151 --> 00:28:59.151
<v Speaker 3>perfection is a concept that is so profound that it makes happiness as a concept</v>

512
00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:07.580
<v Speaker 3>designed to encapsulate the meaning of life so shallow that it instantly becomes</v>

513
00:29:07.771 --> 00:29:08.940
<v Speaker 3>virtually negligible.</v>

514
00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:19.710
<v Speaker 1>We have a hypothesis here that the purpose of conscious being is for those</v>

515
00:29:20.891 --> 00:29:25.330
<v Speaker 1>beings who are conscious to transcend their mortal limitations and to work for</v>

516
00:29:25.331 --> 00:29:30.331
<v Speaker 1>the perfection of all that exists as a goal that justifies suffering.</v>

517
00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:32.350
<v Speaker 1>That's unbeatable.</v>

518
00:29:32.351 --> 00:29:37.351
<v Speaker 1>I think because what it does is broaden and deepen your life in a manner that</v>

519
00:29:37.961 --> 00:29:40.900
<v Speaker 1>you might compare to the difference between elevator music.</v>

520
00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:42.430
<v Speaker 1>A Beethoven symphony.</v>

521
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000
<v Speaker 3>It's not that the symphony is in any sense happier than the Muzak,</v>

522
00:29:48.761 --> 00:29:50.200
<v Speaker 3>and in fact quite the contrary,</v>

523
00:29:50.201 --> 00:29:51.790
<v Speaker 3>but it's deeper and more profound.</v>

524
00:29:51.791 --> 00:29:56.791
<v Speaker 3>Enricher and incorporates more and justifies itself more and that's the right</v>

525
00:29:57.341 --> 00:29:58.600
<v Speaker 3>metaphor for life,</v>

526
00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:59.620
<v Speaker 3>not happiness,</v>

527
00:29:59.621 --> 00:30:00.220
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

528
00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:01.960
<v Speaker 3>but depth and and,</v>

529
00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:07.020
<v Speaker 3>and differentiated quality and profundity to match the profundity of the</v>

530
00:30:07.241 --> 00:30:08.530
<v Speaker 3>necessity of suffering.</v>
