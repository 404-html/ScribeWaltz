1
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:06.961
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2
00:00:06.961 --> 00:00:10.470
<v Speaker 1>So that's another issue that I'd like to bring up because one of the things,</v>

3
00:00:10.471 --> 00:00:15.471
<v Speaker 1>I cannot say grout is the alliance between the postmodernists and the Neo</v>

4
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:16.470
<v Speaker 1>Marxists.</v>

5
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.120
<v Speaker 1>I can't understand the causal relationship there because the,</v>

6
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.260
<v Speaker 1>tell me if you disagree with this.</v>

7
00:00:22.261 --> 00:00:22.561
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

8
00:00:22.561 --> 00:00:23.190
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>

9
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:23.700
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

10
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm a psychologist,</v>

11
00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:28.290
<v Speaker 1>not a sociologist and so I'm dabbling in things that are outside of my field of</v>

12
00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:30.150
<v Speaker 1>expertise and there is some danger in that.</v>

13
00:00:30.151 --> 00:00:31.320
<v Speaker 1>But the scent,</v>

14
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.700
<v Speaker 1>the central postmodernist claim seems to me that because there's a near infinite</v>

15
00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:38.850
<v Speaker 1>number of ways to interpret a complex set of phenomena,</v>

16
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:39.250
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

17
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.980
<v Speaker 1>which actually happens to be the case,</v>

18
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.120
<v Speaker 1>that you can't make a case that any of those modes of interpretation,</v>

19
00:00:45.121 --> 00:00:46.050
<v Speaker 1>our canonical,</v>

20
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.730
<v Speaker 1>and so if they're not canonical,</v>

21
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:49.100
<v Speaker 1>if that,</v>

22
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.260
<v Speaker 1>if that canonical element isn't based in some kind of reality,</v>

23
00:00:52.261 --> 00:00:53.820
<v Speaker 1>then it serves some other master.</v>

24
00:00:53.821 --> 00:00:57.510
<v Speaker 1>And so the master that it hypothetically serves for the postmodernists is</v>

25
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.740
<v Speaker 1>nothing but power because that seems to be everything that they believe in.</v>

26
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.250
<v Speaker 1>They don't believe in competence.</v>

27
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.720
<v Speaker 1>They don't believe in authority.</v>

28
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.120
<v Speaker 1>They don't seem to believe in an objective world because everything is language</v>

29
00:01:07.121 --> 00:01:07.954
<v Speaker 1>mediated.</v>

30
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.990
<v Speaker 1>So it's an extraordinarily cynical perspective that that because there's an</v>

31
00:01:12.991 --> 00:01:14.610
<v Speaker 1>infinite number of interpretations,</v>

32
00:01:14.611 --> 00:01:15.720
<v Speaker 1>none of them are canonical,</v>

33
00:01:15.721 --> 00:01:18.240
<v Speaker 1>you can attribute it to everything to power and dominance.</v>

34
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.751
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

35
00:01:18.751 --> 00:01:19.310
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

36
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.390
<v Speaker 1>that seemed like a reasonable summary of the</v>

37
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.210
<v Speaker 1>radical relativism.</v>

38
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.570
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

39
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.070
<v Speaker 1>It's a radical relativism now.</v>

40
00:01:26.071 --> 00:01:27.720
<v Speaker 1>But the strange thing is despite,</v>

41
00:01:27.721 --> 00:01:28.021
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

42
00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:31.620
<v Speaker 1>and so what goes along with that is the demolition of grand narratives.</v>

43
00:01:31.621 --> 00:01:33.150
<v Speaker 1>And so that would be associated,</v>

44
00:01:33.151 --> 00:01:33.721
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

45
00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:37.170
<v Speaker 1>with the rejection of thinkers like young and Eric Norman because of course</v>

46
00:01:37.171 --> 00:01:38.970
<v Speaker 1>their foundational thinkers,</v>

47
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

48
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.130
<v Speaker 1>in relationship to the idea that there are embodied grand narratives that's</v>

49
00:01:44.131 --> 00:01:44.964
<v Speaker 1>never touched.</v>

50
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.930
<v Speaker 1>But then despite the fact that the grand narrative is rejected,</v>

51
00:01:48.931 --> 00:01:51.090
<v Speaker 1>there's a neo Marxism that's tightly,</v>

52
00:01:51.091 --> 00:01:52.880
<v Speaker 1>tightly allied with postmodernism.</v>

53
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.890
<v Speaker 1>It also seems to shade into this strange identity politics.</v>

54
00:01:55.891 --> 00:01:56.790
<v Speaker 1>And I don't,</v>

55
00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:58.141
<v Speaker 1>two things,</v>

56
00:01:58.141 --> 00:02:00.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand the causal relationship there.</v>

57
00:02:00.721 --> 00:02:01.460
<v Speaker 1>Like the,</v>

58
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.010
<v Speaker 1>the skeptical part of me thinks that postmodernism was a,</v>

59
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.720
<v Speaker 1>was an intellectual,</v>

60
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.220
<v Speaker 1>it's intellectual camouflage for the continuation of the kind of pathological</v>

61
00:02:11.221 --> 00:02:13.320
<v Speaker 1>Marxism that produced the Soviet Union.</v>

62
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.220
<v Speaker 1>And that has no independent existence as an intellectual field whatsoever.</v>

63
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.470
<v Speaker 1>But I still can't understand how the postmodernists can make the no grand</v>

64
00:02:22.471 --> 00:02:23.700
<v Speaker 1>narrative claim,</v>

65
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.970
<v Speaker 1>but then immerse themselves in this grand narrative.</v>

66
00:02:27.971 --> 00:02:31.680
<v Speaker 1>W W without anyone pointing out the evidence contradictions.</v>

67
00:02:31.681 --> 00:02:33.000
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't understand that.</v>

68
00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:34.590
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think about that?</v>

69
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.951
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

70
00:02:34.951 --> 00:02:38.070
<v Speaker 2>I can only speak about literary and professors really,</v>

71
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.350
<v Speaker 2>and they seem to me almost universally in the u s to being very naive or they,</v>

72
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.810
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

73
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.090
<v Speaker 2>they seem to know nothing about actual history,</v>

74
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.920
<v Speaker 2>political science or economics.</v>

75
00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.960
<v Speaker 2>It's simply an attitude.</v>

76
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.590
<v Speaker 2>They have an attitude and it would,</v>

77
00:02:50.591 --> 00:02:54.870
<v Speaker 2>in Marxism becomes simply a badge by which they telegraph their,</v>

78
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.620
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

79
00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.860
<v Speaker 2>their solidarity with a working class that they have nothing to do with.</v>

80
00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:59.350
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

81
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

82
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.840
<v Speaker 2>really nothing but contempt.</v>

83
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:02.180
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

84
00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.730
<v Speaker 2>And the thing is that the,</v>

85
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.880
<v Speaker 2>the campus leftists are almost notorious for their,</v>

86
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

87
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.970
<v Speaker 2>for their rather snobbish treatment of staff.</v>

88
00:03:09.971 --> 00:03:10.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean they don't,</v>

89
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.110
<v Speaker 2>they don't have any rapport with the actual working class members of the,</v>

90
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.973
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

91
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.210
<v Speaker 2>of the infrastructure,</v>

92
00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.960
<v Speaker 2>the janitor,</v>

93
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:17.790
<v Speaker 2>the janitors,</v>

94
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:18.623
<v Speaker 2>and even the,</v>

95
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:19.630
<v Speaker 2>even the secretaries,</v>

96
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.480
<v Speaker 2>there's a kind of high and mighty aristocracy,</v>

97
00:03:22.481 --> 00:03:22.661
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

98
00:03:22.661 --> 00:03:23.980
<v Speaker 2>about these have just,</v>

99
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.150
<v Speaker 2>these are people who,</v>

100
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.780
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

101
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.000
<v Speaker 2>who have wandered into the English department.</v>

102
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.420
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

103
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.120
<v Speaker 2>And we're products of a time when,</v>

104
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.013
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

105
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.441
<v Speaker 2>during the,</v>

106
00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:35.800
<v Speaker 2>the new criticism they wait with when history with history and psychology had</v>

107
00:03:35.801 --> 00:03:36.634
<v Speaker 2>been excluded.</v>

108
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

109
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.200
<v Speaker 2>my ambition,</v>

110
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:38.411
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

111
00:03:38.411 --> 00:03:40.840
<v Speaker 2>Was I love the new criticism okay.</v>

112
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:41.270
<v Speaker 2>As,</v>

113
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.540
<v Speaker 2>as a style of textual analysis.</v>

114
00:03:43.541 --> 00:03:43.910
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

115
00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:44.120
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

116
00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.441
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

117
00:03:44.441 --> 00:03:47.620
<v Speaker 2>and the new criticism had multiple interpretations.</v>

118
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.831
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

119
00:03:47.831 --> 00:03:48.790
<v Speaker 2>That were possible.</v>

120
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:49.020
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

121
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.180
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

122
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.170
<v Speaker 2>and they were encouraged.</v>

123
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.711
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

124
00:03:50.711 --> 00:03:51.011
<v Speaker 2>one of the,</v>

125
00:03:51.011 --> 00:03:51.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

126
00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.680
<v Speaker 2>one of the great projects was made in Max series,</v>

127
00:03:53.681 --> 00:03:54.740
<v Speaker 2>20th century views.</v>

128
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.380
<v Speaker 2>What you had at least some books.</v>

129
00:03:56.381 --> 00:04:00.700
<v Speaker 2>I adored them in college and it was about Jane Austin or about Emily Bronte or</v>

130
00:04:00.701 --> 00:04:02.500
<v Speaker 2>about Wordsworth.</v>

131
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.280
<v Speaker 2>And they were collections of alternate views of the same thing.</v>

132
00:04:06.281 --> 00:04:07.690
<v Speaker 2>The idea that no more,</v>

133
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:08.620
<v Speaker 2>no alternative views.</v>

134
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.640
<v Speaker 2>And there was no relativistic situational kind of,</v>

135
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.080
<v Speaker 2>kind of an interpretive approach is nonsense.</v>

136
00:04:14.081 --> 00:04:14.341
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

137
00:04:14.341 --> 00:04:14.800
<v Speaker 2>About,</v>

138
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.800
<v Speaker 2>but the point was we needed to restore right history to literary literary study.</v>

139
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.740
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

140
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.140
<v Speaker 2>And we needed to add psychology to it because it was,</v>

141
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:24.730
<v Speaker 2>there was great animus against Freud.</v>

142
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.130
<v Speaker 2>And when I arrived in,</v>

143
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.981
<v Speaker 2>in graduate school,</v>

144
00:04:26.981 --> 00:04:27.281
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>

145
00:04:27.281 --> 00:04:30.700
<v Speaker 2>I actually went into the director of graduate studies and protested the way</v>

146
00:04:30.701 --> 00:04:35.701
<v Speaker 2>Freud and Freud and were used as as negative terms pay in a sneering way by that</v>

147
00:04:35.741 --> 00:04:36.790
<v Speaker 2>very wasp professors.</v>

148
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.120
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

149
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.110
<v Speaker 2>So we need to do it.</v>

150
00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:38.650
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>

151
00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.300
<v Speaker 2>it seemed like we were moving there.</v>

152
00:04:40.301 --> 00:04:44.960
<v Speaker 2>It can be in the early 1970s was a great period of psycho biography about great.</v>

153
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.180
<v Speaker 2>About political figures.</v>

154
00:04:46.181 --> 00:04:47.014
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

155
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.010
<v Speaker 2>So I thought it's happening in all of a sudden it all got short circuited by</v>

156
00:04:51.011 --> 00:04:51.761
<v Speaker 2>this arrival,</v>

157
00:04:51.761 --> 00:04:51.981
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

158
00:04:51.981 --> 00:04:54.700

159
00:04:54.701 --> 00:04:55.900
<v Speaker 2>in the 1970s.</v>

160
00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:56.500
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

161
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.861
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

162
00:04:56.861 --> 00:04:57.880
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>

163
00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:58.410
<v Speaker 2>I feel,</v>

164
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.100
<v Speaker 2>I am an old historicist okay.</v>

165
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.490
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>

166
00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.390
<v Speaker 2>not a new historicist.</v>

167
00:05:01.391 --> 00:05:01.870
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>

168
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:02.471
<v Speaker 2>I think new stores,</v>

169
00:05:02.471 --> 00:05:03.670
<v Speaker 2>so it was an absolute scam.</v>

170
00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:04.480
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

171
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.021

177
00:05:09.011 --> 00:05:09.731
<v Speaker 2>a little bit of that,</v>

178
00:05:09.731 --> 00:05:10.660
<v Speaker 2>a little bit of that.</v>

179
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.130
<v Speaker 2>You make a little tiny salad.</v>

180
00:05:12.131 --> 00:05:14.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to say I'm selling this atomize thing.</v>

181
00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.920
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

182
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.660
<v Speaker 2>It's supposed to mean something.</v>

183
00:05:16.661 --> 00:05:18.070
<v Speaker 2>It's all can be very superficial,</v>

184
00:05:18.071 --> 00:05:18.904
<v Speaker 2>very cynical,</v>

185
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.170
<v Speaker 2>very distance.</v>

186

<v Speaker 2>I am a product.</v>

189
00:05:22.871 --> 00:05:23.081
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

190
00:05:23.081 --> 00:05:25.510
<v Speaker 2>Of Old historicism German philology.</v>

191
00:05:25.511 --> 00:05:26.040
<v Speaker 2>I decided my,</v>

192
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.430
<v Speaker 2>my first choice of a profession when I was a child would was Egyptology</v>

193
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.313
<v Speaker 2>archaeology.</v>

194
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.640
<v Speaker 2>Everything I ever think about or say is,</v>

195
00:05:34.641 --> 00:05:37.030
<v Speaker 2>is related to an enormous time scheme.</v>

196
00:05:37.031 --> 00:05:37.181
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

197
00:05:37.181 --> 00:05:37.391
<v Speaker 2>From,</v>

198
00:05:37.391 --> 00:05:39.730
<v Speaker 2>from antiquity and indeed from the Stone Age.</v>

199
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:40.060
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

200
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.380
<v Speaker 2>And that is the problem with,</v>

201
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:42.101
<v Speaker 2>with these people,</v>

202
00:05:42.101 --> 00:05:43.570
<v Speaker 2>they're their mouth educated,</v>

203
00:05:43.571 --> 00:05:46.270
<v Speaker 2>the postmodernist and academic Marxists.</v>

204
00:05:46.271 --> 00:05:46.870
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

205
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.840
<v Speaker 2>Our mount educated embarrassingly so.</v>

206
00:05:49.841 --> 00:05:50.051
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

207
00:05:50.051 --> 00:05:53.380
<v Speaker 2>They know nothing before the present full call.</v>

208
00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:53.890
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

209
00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.920
<v Speaker 2>It's absolutely a joke before the enlightenment.</v>

210
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:57.793
<v Speaker 2>Hey Dave,</v>

211
00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.570
<v Speaker 2>perhaps he might be useful to people to talk about what happened after</v>

212
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:02.690
<v Speaker 2>neoclassicism,</v>

213
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.261
<v Speaker 2>which by the way,</v>

214
00:06:03.261 --> 00:06:06.650
<v Speaker 2>he failed to notice a lot of what he was talking about.</v>

215
00:06:06.651 --> 00:06:06.820
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

216
00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.670
<v Speaker 2>Turns out to see be simply the hangover of neoclassicism.</v>

217
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.851
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

218
00:06:10.851 --> 00:06:11.031
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

219
00:06:11.031 --> 00:06:12.500
<v Speaker 2>this is how ignorant that man was.</v>

220
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:12.861
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

221
00:06:12.861 --> 00:06:13.311
<v Speaker 2>his head was,</v>

222
00:06:13.311 --> 00:06:15.020
<v Speaker 2>he was not talented as a researcher.</v>

223
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.460
<v Speaker 2>He knew absolutely nothing.</v>

224
00:06:16.461 --> 00:06:17.030
<v Speaker 2>Okay with,</v>

225
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:17.241
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

226
00:06:17.241 --> 00:06:18.290
<v Speaker 2>nothing about antiquity.</v>

227
00:06:18.291 --> 00:06:21.700
<v Speaker 2>How can you make any kind of large structure?</v>

228
00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:23.270
<v Speaker 2>While I'm large mechanism,</v>

229
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.571
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

230
00:06:23.571 --> 00:06:27.500
<v Speaker 2>to analyze western culture without knowing about classical antiquity.</v>
