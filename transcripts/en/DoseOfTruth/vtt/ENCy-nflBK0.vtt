00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:03.500
<v Speaker 1>The stories that,</v>

2
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:09.300
<v Speaker 1>that we tell and that we live in are fundamentally ways that we deal with the</v>

3
00:00:10.841 --> 00:00:12.310
<v Speaker 1>complexity of the world.</v>

4
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.230
<v Speaker 1>And the fundamental problem with the world as far as I can tell,</v>

5
00:00:17.231 --> 00:00:20.980
<v Speaker 1>is that not only is it complex beyond your comprehension,</v>

6
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.190
<v Speaker 1>but the complexity shifts in unpredictable ways.</v>

7
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.510
<v Speaker 1>So that's the Darwinian conundrum actually.</v>

8
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.970
<v Speaker 1>That's why Darwinism seems to be a practical necessity with regards to the</v>

9
00:00:33.971 --> 00:00:35.140
<v Speaker 1>continuation of life,</v>

10
00:00:35.141 --> 00:00:39.190
<v Speaker 1>because because of the complexity changes unpredictably,</v>

11
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.580
<v Speaker 1>you can't necessarily tell what's going to work in the future.</v>

12
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.110
<v Speaker 1>And so the Darwinian process solves that by generating quasi random</v>

13
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.860
<v Speaker 1>variations and letting,</v>

14
00:00:50.861 --> 00:00:55.360
<v Speaker 1>whichever one by happenstance happens to work in that environment survive now.</v>

15
00:00:55.361 --> 00:01:00.361
<v Speaker 1>And it's not random precisely because the underlying structure is conserved.</v>

16
00:01:01.721 --> 00:01:05.290
<v Speaker 1>It's very rare that a child would be born with an extra arm or something like</v>

17
00:01:05.291 --> 00:01:05.581
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

18
00:01:05.581 --> 00:01:10.581
<v Speaker 1>And like the skeletal structure that you inhabit is shared by animals going way,</v>

19
00:01:11.771 --> 00:01:13.450
<v Speaker 1>way back in evolutionary history.</v>

20
00:01:13.451 --> 00:01:16.750
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of conservation and in the evolutionary process,</v>

21
00:01:16.751 --> 00:01:19.480
<v Speaker 1>but so there's variation within conservation,</v>

22
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.560
<v Speaker 1>like music.</v>

23
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:21.281
<v Speaker 1>It's a good,</v>

24
00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:22.690
<v Speaker 1>it's a good way of thinking about it.</v>

25
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.370
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

26
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.963
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

27
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.090
<v Speaker 1>the stories that we tell have exactly the same structure.</v>

28
00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:31.924
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

29
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.100
<v Speaker 1>they have this,</v>

30
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.960
<v Speaker 1>his core element with variations.</v>
