1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:00.933
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2
00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.190
<v Speaker 1>and was promoted and not liking it</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I have to adjust massively.</v>

3
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.340
<v Speaker 1>Is there a difference between liking</v>
<v Speaker 1>your job and the lack of discipline to</v>

4
00:00:14.341 --> 00:00:15.660
<v Speaker 1>perform a change?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are there,</v>

5
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.370
<v Speaker 1>are they connected?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6
00:00:17.371 --> 00:00:20.550
<v Speaker 1>While they're definitely connected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a tough one.</v>

7
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.520
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing I would say is that if</v>

8
00:00:23.521 --> 00:00:25.890
<v Speaker 1>it was a real radical change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:25.891 --> 00:00:28.530
<v Speaker 1>it takes people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless they're very young,</v>

10
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.670
<v Speaker 1>it takes people about a year to adjust</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a really radical change,</v>

11
00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:35.790
<v Speaker 1>like to move to a new city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

12
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.210
<v Speaker 1>to adjust to being married.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That can take longer than a year to</v>

13
00:00:39.211 --> 00:00:44.211
<v Speaker 1>adjust to having a new baby to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to getting over a relatively serious</v>

14
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.030
<v Speaker 1>loss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a death in the family a year,</v>

15
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.020
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the first thing you might ask</v>

16
00:00:52.021 --> 00:00:55.050
<v Speaker 1>yourself is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are there things that are good about the</v>

17
00:00:55.051 --> 00:00:56.730
<v Speaker 1>promotion?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second is,</v>

18
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.740
<v Speaker 1>do you have the capacity to do the job</v>
<v Speaker 1>or to learn how to do it?</v>

19
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.610
<v Speaker 1>You could talk to someone about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the third thing is have you</v>

20
00:01:05.611 --> 00:01:09.210
<v Speaker 1>given yourself enough time to adjust?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because one of the things I often</v>

21
00:01:09.211 --> 00:01:11.430
<v Speaker 1>recommend to people when they've made a</v>
<v Speaker 1>radical change,</v>

22
00:01:11.431 --> 00:01:13.880
<v Speaker 1>like going leaving home and going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>universities,</v>

23
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.780
<v Speaker 1>don't pay any attention to how you feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a year because everything is so much</v>

24
00:01:18.781 --> 00:01:21.540
<v Speaker 1>up in the air that you can't really</v>
<v Speaker 1>trust your own judgment.</v>

25
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.440
<v Speaker 1>So you have to give yourself time to</v>
<v Speaker 1>adapt and um,</v>

26
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.120
<v Speaker 1>you can't expect that that's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen overnight.</v>

27
00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:29.340
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly not.</v>

28
00:01:29.341 --> 00:01:32.790
<v Speaker 1>And to put that expectation on yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>increases the probability that you're</v>

29
00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:33.960
<v Speaker 1>going to feel bad about it.</v>
