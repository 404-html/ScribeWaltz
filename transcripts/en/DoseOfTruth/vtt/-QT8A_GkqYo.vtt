1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.100
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the snake is</v>

2
00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:07.160
<v Speaker 1>utilize conceptually and metaphorically</v>
<v Speaker 1>as representation of transformation,</v>

3
00:00:07.161 --> 00:00:09.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the snake is something that can</v>

4
00:00:09.351 --> 00:00:13.460
<v Speaker 1>shed its skin and be reborn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that a snake is something that's</v>

5
00:00:13.461 --> 00:00:17.840
<v Speaker 1>innately attractive and terrifying human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings and other primates,</v>

6
00:00:17.841 --> 00:00:22.700
<v Speaker 1>so that if you come across a snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're likely to be at least startled,</v>

7
00:00:22.701 --> 00:00:26.600
<v Speaker 1>if not horrified by it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also attracted to it in a way that</v>

8
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.390
<v Speaker 1>is underneath your voluntary</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>

9
00:00:29.391 --> 00:00:31.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because snakes attract orienting reflex</v>

10
00:00:31.611 --> 00:00:35.300
<v Speaker 1>isn't they activate the systems</v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath your consciousness that</v>

11
00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:37.670
<v Speaker 1>actually govern the structure of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

12
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.040
<v Speaker 1>We know that the snake can be well</v>
<v Speaker 1>represented as well as internal chaos.</v>

13
00:00:43.041 --> 00:00:47.570
<v Speaker 1>So imagine this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine that it's not unreasonable for a</v>

14
00:00:47.571 --> 00:00:52.571
<v Speaker 1>self conscious mind searching for a mode</v>
<v Speaker 1>of self representation to remark on the</v>

15
00:00:53.091 --> 00:00:57.050
<v Speaker 1>parallels between the structure of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>snake and the spine and the brain.</v>

16
00:00:57.051 --> 00:01:00.710
<v Speaker 1>Given that a snake is essentially a</v>
<v Speaker 1>spine with a brain.</v>

17
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.480
<v Speaker 1>And then imagine as well that the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>archaic aspects of our nervous system,</v>

18
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.250
<v Speaker 1>those that govern novelty and orienting</v>
<v Speaker 1>and anxiety responses are in fact</v>

19
00:01:10.251 --> 00:01:15.251
<v Speaker 1>precisely those that were described by</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mclean as nested inside the reptilian</v>

20
00:01:15.831 --> 00:01:18.290
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then imagine along with the Hindu</v>

21
00:01:18.291 --> 00:01:21.140
<v Speaker 1>Yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the purpose of Kundalini Yoga is</v>

22
00:01:21.141 --> 00:01:24.740
<v Speaker 1>to activate the circuitry that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with that snake,</v>

23
00:01:24.741 --> 00:01:28.790
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to produce a permanent state of alert</v>

24
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.430
<v Speaker 1>wakefulness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's associated with consciousness.</v>

25
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.103
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

26
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.770
<v Speaker 1>so imagine this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine an animal like like a zebra</v>

27
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.980
<v Speaker 1>grazing mindlessly in the herd with no</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness whatsoever.</v>

28
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.790
<v Speaker 1>And then imagine it's relatively</v>
<v Speaker 1>undeveloped cortical structures</v>

29
00:01:49.791 --> 00:01:54.791
<v Speaker 1>activated suddenly by the movement of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lion off in the perimeter.</v>

30
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.970
<v Speaker 1>And then imagine for that brief moment</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thawed zebra is actually conscious,</v>

31
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.150
<v Speaker 1>a state that requires a tremendous</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of energy on difficult to</v>

32
00:02:02.151 --> 00:02:04.970
<v Speaker 1>maintain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because the threat and the</v>

33
00:02:04.971 --> 00:02:09.971
<v Speaker 1>uncertainty manifest itself within the</v>
<v Speaker 1>zebras mode of consciousness,</v>

34
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.880
<v Speaker 1>it wakes momentarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then imagine that human beings are</v>

35
00:02:13.881 --> 00:02:17.990
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zebra always because we've become self</v>

36
00:02:17.991 --> 00:02:21.800
<v Speaker 1>conscious because we know that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown is around us all the time.</v>

37
00:02:21.801 --> 00:02:24.770
<v Speaker 1>Even when we think we're safe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're never safe.</v>

38
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.530
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason we're so conscious is because</v>

39
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.270
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence of our discovery of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility of our own mortality,</v>

40
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.100
<v Speaker 1>all of this underlying circuitry that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>other animals is only apparent when</v>

41
00:02:37.101 --> 00:02:40.160
<v Speaker 1>they're startled or afraid or interested</v>
<v Speaker 1>or curious.</v>

42
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.050
<v Speaker 1>In human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's on all the time.</v>

43
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.380
<v Speaker 1>And that's what makes us conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is because we</v>

44
00:02:45.381 --> 00:02:50.381
<v Speaker 1>developed enough cortical elaboration to</v>
<v Speaker 1>note that we're always threatened by</v>

45
00:02:50.451 --> 00:02:53.150
<v Speaker 1>everything that's around us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then imagine that,</v>

46
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:54.920
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty awful,</v>

47
00:02:54.921 --> 00:02:57.500
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's at the basis of all our</v>

48
00:02:57.501 --> 00:03:01.660
<v Speaker 1>innate existential,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then imagine as well that without</v>

49
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:06.661
<v Speaker 1>that terror pushing us forward and and</v>
<v Speaker 1>our constant reference to the dangerous</v>

50
00:03:06.911 --> 00:03:10.330
<v Speaker 1>aspect of the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would have never been motivated to</v>

51
00:03:10.331 --> 00:03:13.120
<v Speaker 1>produce the kind of societies that we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>produced,</v>

52
00:03:13.121 --> 00:03:18.121
<v Speaker 1>which are essentially very remarkably</v>
<v Speaker 1>elaborated devices that enable us to</v>

53
00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:22.660
<v Speaker 1>find some protection from that unknown</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to manipulate,</v>

54
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.280
<v Speaker 1>manipulate it effectively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then remembering that story we will</v>

55
00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:32.281
<v Speaker 1>return to genesis young says the snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his was regarded by early gnostic</v>

56
00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:40.020
<v Speaker 1>Christians as a kind of daddy who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>faculties were more developed and</v>

57
00:03:40.021 --> 00:03:43.530
<v Speaker 1>advanced than the original daddy that</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually structured the world.</v>

58
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:48.060
<v Speaker 1>The idea there being that the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>initially was a pretty dismal place.</v>

59
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.720
<v Speaker 1>Everyone wasn't conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all existed at the level of the</v>

60
00:03:51.721 --> 00:03:54.660
<v Speaker 1>animal and then the snake came along and</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

61
00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.000
<v Speaker 1>wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wake up.</v>

62
00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.830
<v Speaker 1>And the movement from that state of</v>
<v Speaker 1>unself consciousness paradise to this</v>

63
00:04:01.831 --> 00:04:06.831
<v Speaker 1>profane state of awakening can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>regarded not so much as a descent,</v>

64
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.200
<v Speaker 1>but as an asset of sorts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though a painful one.</v>

65
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.320
<v Speaker 1>And then you have your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at this commentary from Mephistopheles,</v>

66
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.980
<v Speaker 1>his representation of Satan and his</v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity for temptation,</v>

67
00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.850
<v Speaker 1>who says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>follow the adage of my cousin's snake</v>

68
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.250
<v Speaker 1>from dreams of God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like knowledge.</v>

69
00:04:27.251 --> 00:04:32.251
<v Speaker 1>You will wake to fear in which your very</v>
<v Speaker 1>soul shell quake a statement associating</v>

70
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:39.450
<v Speaker 1>the human tendency to attribute to all</v>
<v Speaker 1>revolutionary sources of new</v>

71
00:04:40.991 --> 00:04:42.100
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

72
00:04:42.101 --> 00:04:47.101
<v Speaker 1>kind of demonic being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have the problem of the</v>

73
00:04:47.291 --> 00:04:50.590
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we know that within the context of</v>

74
00:04:50.591 --> 00:04:54.430
<v Speaker 1>the Judeo Christian tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women have unduly suffered for their</v>

75
00:04:54.431 --> 00:04:59.431
<v Speaker 1>role and tempting humanity in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>embodied form of Adam towards higher</v>

76
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.110
<v Speaker 1>order self consciousness.</v>

77
00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.943
<v Speaker 1>And then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

78
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.240
<v Speaker 1>let's just take a look at how human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings and their mating relationships</v>

79
00:05:07.241 --> 00:05:11.740
<v Speaker 1>differ from those of other animals like</v>
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzees to whom we are very closely,</v>

80
00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.680
<v Speaker 1>genetically related.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at the mating strategies</v>

81
00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:18.430
<v Speaker 1>of female chimpanzees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see that they really don't care who</v>

82
00:05:18.431 --> 00:05:20.200
<v Speaker 1>they sleep with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

83
00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:25.180
<v Speaker 1>Any old chimpanzee will do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the last dominant male chimps tend</v>

84
00:05:25.181 --> 00:05:27.790
<v Speaker 1>to be chased away by the more dominant</v>
<v Speaker 1>male chimps.</v>

85
00:05:27.791 --> 00:05:31.900
<v Speaker 1>But if a female and less dominant chimp</v>
<v Speaker 1>can get the hell away from the watchful</v>

86
00:05:31.901 --> 00:05:35.170
<v Speaker 1>gaze of the dominance hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're perfectly happy to mate.</v>

87
00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.850
<v Speaker 1>Human females are not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is selective matters,</v>

88
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.140
<v Speaker 1>and there's a tremendous body of</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary psychological information</v>

89
00:05:44.141 --> 00:05:49.120
<v Speaker 1>that suggests that although both genders</v>
<v Speaker 1>value intelligence and physical</v>

90
00:05:49.121 --> 00:05:53.740
<v Speaker 1>appearance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>females value the ability to attain</v>

91
00:05:53.741 --> 00:05:57.950
<v Speaker 1>dominance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy status in men far than men,</v>

92
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.880
<v Speaker 1>admire the ability to attain dominant</v>
<v Speaker 1>status in women,</v>

93
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:06.910
<v Speaker 1>which is to say that men don't care what</v>
<v Speaker 1>a woman has with regards to potential</v>

94
00:06:07.281 --> 00:06:08.330
<v Speaker 1>for attaining status.</v>

95
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.660
<v Speaker 1>Whereas with women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the strong determinants of</v>

96
00:06:11.661 --> 00:06:13.160
<v Speaker 1>mating preference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Len,</v>

97
00:06:13.161 --> 00:06:14.060
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

98
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.690
<v Speaker 1>we don't know why the hell our cortex is</v>
<v Speaker 1>expanded so rapidly,</v>

99
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.300
<v Speaker 1>somewhere between five and 3 million</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

100
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:24.710
<v Speaker 1>Let's offer this as a hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The women started to get choosy,</v>

101
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.690
<v Speaker 1>and because they were so damn</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated,</v>

102
00:06:26.691 --> 00:06:31.670
<v Speaker 1>the whole human species had to</v>
<v Speaker 1>exaggerate it's cortical growth prior to</v>

103
00:06:31.671 --> 00:06:36.671
<v Speaker 1>any even use for that cortical growth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just so that the men had an even hand in</v>

104
00:06:37.161 --> 00:06:38.330
<v Speaker 1>the competition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

105
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:43.430
<v Speaker 1>So women put tremendous selection</v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure on the human being to develop</v>

106
00:06:43.431 --> 00:06:46.190
<v Speaker 1>tremendous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous cortical expansion.</v>

107
00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.490
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we already know that from a mythological</v>

108
00:06:49.491 --> 00:06:52.070
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that women are frequently casting to the</v>

109
00:06:52.071 --> 00:06:56.810
<v Speaker 1>same conceptual domain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the temptress domain as the benevolent</v>

110
00:06:56.811 --> 00:07:00.200
<v Speaker 1>aspect of the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we know as well from representations</v>

111
00:07:00.201 --> 00:07:03.920
<v Speaker 1>of hero mythology that it is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual who goes out to confront</v>

112
00:07:03.921 --> 00:07:06.410
<v Speaker 1>chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's most likely to free from the</v>

113
00:07:06.411 --> 00:07:08.220
<v Speaker 1>Dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only treasured,</v>

114
00:07:08.221 --> 00:07:11.120
<v Speaker 1>but a virgin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say in the case of mythological</v>

115
00:07:11.121 --> 00:07:13.850
<v Speaker 1>representations like Saint George and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Dragon.</v>
