1
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.340
<v Speaker 1>No on Rio and birthday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was an existentialist</v>

2
00:00:12.341 --> 00:00:14.230
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.040
<v Speaker 1>and who was a leader of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>existentialist movement in the 1950s and</v>

4
00:00:18.041 --> 00:00:20.470
<v Speaker 1>also a profound student of</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalysts.</v>

5
00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.790
<v Speaker 1>Psychoanalysis talked about something he</v>
<v Speaker 1>characterized as a creative illness,</v>

6
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.860
<v Speaker 1>which was something that manifested</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself in Freud and in you and in other</v>

7
00:00:29.861 --> 00:00:34.450
<v Speaker 1>people like Viktor Frankl for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who went through periods of extreme and</v>

8
00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:37.510
<v Speaker 1>Darwin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme periods of chaotic disruption</v>

9
00:00:37.511 --> 00:00:41.620
<v Speaker 1>has their new theories were manifesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves because the new theories tore</v>

10
00:00:41.621 --> 00:00:45.280
<v Speaker 1>them apart as they were being developed</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they paid a tremendous personal</v>

11
00:00:45.281 --> 00:00:47.620
<v Speaker 1>price for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But generally they were able to</v>

12
00:00:47.621 --> 00:00:52.060
<v Speaker 1>reorganize themselves within the context</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the new theory and that made their</v>

13
00:00:52.061 --> 00:00:55.900
<v Speaker 1>stance more powerful and more complete</v>
<v Speaker 1>than it was before he described the</v>

14
00:00:55.901 --> 00:00:58.480
<v Speaker 1>characteristic elements of the creative</v>
<v Speaker 1>illnesses follows.</v>

15
00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.190
<v Speaker 1>It succeeds a period of intense</v>
<v Speaker 1>preoccupation with an idea and search</v>

16
00:01:03.191 --> 00:01:06.670
<v Speaker 1>for a certain truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a polymorphous condition that can</v>

17
00:01:06.671 --> 00:01:08.770
<v Speaker 1>take the SAPE of depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neurosis,</v>

18
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.950
<v Speaker 1>psychosomatic ailments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even psychosis,</v>

19
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.560
<v Speaker 1>whatever the symptoms they are felt as</v>
<v Speaker 1>painful,</v>

20
00:01:14.561 --> 00:01:18.550
<v Speaker 1>if not agonizing by the subject with</v>
<v Speaker 1>alternating periods of alleviation and</v>

21
00:01:18.551 --> 00:01:20.560
<v Speaker 1>worsening it's route.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The onus.</v>

22
00:01:20.561 --> 00:01:24.580
<v Speaker 1>The subject never loses the thread of</v>
<v Speaker 1>his dominating preoccupation.</v>

23
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.600
<v Speaker 1>It's often compatible with normal</v>
<v Speaker 1>professional activity and family life.</v>

24
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.900
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

25
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.910
<v Speaker 1>But even if he keeps to his social</v>
<v Speaker 1>activities,</v>

26
00:01:32.911 --> 00:01:35.070
<v Speaker 1>he's almost entirely absorbed with</v>
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>

27
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.590
<v Speaker 1>He suffers from feelings of isolation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even when he has a mentor who guides</v>

28
00:01:40.591 --> 00:01:43.800
<v Speaker 1>them through the ordeal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the showman apprentice with his</v>

29
00:01:43.801 --> 00:01:46.830
<v Speaker 1>master.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The termination is often rapid and</v>

30
00:01:46.831 --> 00:01:51.000
<v Speaker 1>marked by a phase of exhilaration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The subject emerges from his ordeal with</v>

31
00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:54.360
<v Speaker 1>a permanent transformation in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality and the conviction that he</v>

32
00:01:54.361 --> 00:01:58.620
<v Speaker 1>has discovered a great truth or a new</v>
<v Speaker 1>spiritual world also happened to Piaget.</v>

33
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.490
<v Speaker 1>Many of the 19th and 20th century</v>
<v Speaker 1>figures recognized universally is great</v>

34
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.580
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Darwin,</v>

35
00:02:05.581 --> 00:02:06.840
<v Speaker 1>Dostoevsky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tolstoy,</v>

36
00:02:06.841 --> 00:02:07.710
<v Speaker 1>Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young.</v>

37
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.890
<v Speaker 1>We're also additionally characterized by</v>
<v Speaker 1>lengthy periods of profound</v>

38
00:02:10.891 --> 00:02:15.891
<v Speaker 1>psychological unrest and uncertainty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's our dream that my daughter had</v>

39
00:02:15.991 --> 00:02:18.000
<v Speaker 1>when she was three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is quite a cool dream.</v>

40
00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:20.100
<v Speaker 1>I caught it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was able to write it down verbatim</v>

41
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.480
<v Speaker 1>because I was writing at the time.</v>

42
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.960
<v Speaker 1>So she came in to tell me this dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I typed it out because it's not that</v>

43
00:02:24.961 --> 00:02:27.900
<v Speaker 1>easy to catch a kid's dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here was the situation.</v>

44
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.290
<v Speaker 1>So when we brought her brother home from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hospital,</v>

45
00:02:31.291 --> 00:02:33.790
<v Speaker 1>he is two years younger than her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't know,</v>

46
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's less than a three year gap</v>

47
00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:38.460
<v Speaker 1>between siblings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a high probability of sibling</v>

48
00:02:38.461 --> 00:02:41.640
<v Speaker 1>rivalry because the old siblings still</v>
<v Speaker 1>needs a lot of attention.</v>

49
00:02:41.641 --> 00:02:44.640
<v Speaker 1>But you know when you have a two year</v>
<v Speaker 1>old you think man that's a baby.</v>

50
00:02:44.641 --> 00:02:47.880
<v Speaker 1>But when you bring a newborn baby home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that two year olds in adult,</v>

51
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.420
<v Speaker 1>like there's such a radical difference</v>
<v Speaker 1>between a newborn and a two year old.</v>

52
00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:53.180
<v Speaker 1>And so it's hard on the two year old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

53
00:02:53.181 --> 00:02:55.410
<v Speaker 1>Cause they have to grow up right away</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe they don't get as much</v>

54
00:02:55.411 --> 00:02:57.630
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we taught her to,</v>

55
00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.600
<v Speaker 1>we taught her to come for a hug when she</v>
<v Speaker 1>needed to by practicing that.</v>

56
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.670
<v Speaker 1>And we also prepared her and told her</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

57
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was going to be some trouble but</v>

58
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.420
<v Speaker 1>she could get some attention from this</v>
<v Speaker 1>new baby.</v>

59
00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:10.030
<v Speaker 1>And that was also her baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she was all prepared for that.</v>

60
00:03:10.031 --> 00:03:14.470
<v Speaker 1>And so she took a lot of care of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>baby and she thought it was her baby and</v>

61
00:03:14.471 --> 00:03:18.040
<v Speaker 1>she liked this baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so she called him baby and then,</v>

62
00:03:18.041 --> 00:03:19.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he started to toddle around and,</v>

63
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.360
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we told her one day,</v>

64
00:03:22.361 --> 00:03:24.050
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was being toilet trained.</v>

65
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.970
<v Speaker 1>We said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

66
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.490
<v Speaker 1>Mckayla,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not really a baby anymore.</v>

67
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.440
<v Speaker 1>And she didn't like that because she</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>

68
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.880
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like that baby.</v>

69
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.540
<v Speaker 1>And now whatever this creature is</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently is not that baby.</v>

70
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.310
<v Speaker 1>And so what am I supposed to do about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

71
00:03:36.311 --> 00:03:40.120
<v Speaker 1>And not as a profound question because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are lots of parents who don't let</v>

72
00:03:40.121 --> 00:03:44.440
<v Speaker 1>their children progress past the stage</v>
<v Speaker 1>of baby because they don't want to lose</v>

73
00:03:44.441 --> 00:03:47.800
<v Speaker 1>the baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's like she was onto something</v>

74
00:03:47.801 --> 00:03:49.150
<v Speaker 1>major.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

75
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:50.493
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

76
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.020
<v Speaker 1>so this is what she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is your dream.</v>

77
00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.420
<v Speaker 1>Julian is the name of her little</v>
<v Speaker 1>brother.</v>

78
00:03:58.421 --> 00:04:02.410
<v Speaker 1>Julian's eyes falled out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he falled into pieces and I</v>

79
00:04:02.411 --> 00:04:02.851
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

80
00:04:02.851 --> 00:04:04.450
<v Speaker 1>what sort of pieces?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>

81
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.220
<v Speaker 1>Julian pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

82
00:04:06.221 --> 00:04:08.980
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then his bones falled out too.</v>

83
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.770
<v Speaker 1>Then a whole garden and there was water</v>
<v Speaker 1>in it.</v>

84
00:04:11.771 --> 00:04:14.740
<v Speaker 1>And when he came out he was big and my</v>
<v Speaker 1>wife said,</v>

85
00:04:14.741 --> 00:04:17.230
<v Speaker 1>Julian isn't a baby anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And mckayla said,</v>

86
00:04:17.231 --> 00:04:20.280
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a big boy and above with legs got</v>

87
00:04:20.281 --> 00:04:24.790
<v Speaker 1>him out cause bugs can swim and the hole</v>
<v Speaker 1>was in the park and the park and it</v>

88
00:04:24.791 --> 00:04:27.340
<v Speaker 1>moved into the backyard and he felt he</v>
<v Speaker 1>falled in it,</v>

89
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.140
<v Speaker 1>a tree burned and left the hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was pretty cool.</v>

90
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.310
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grade three,</v>

91
00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three year old kid.</v>

92
00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:36.240
<v Speaker 1>And so the park,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they started,</v>

93
00:04:36.241 --> 00:04:39.310
<v Speaker 1>the place was 42 acres and it was like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>real forest and park.</v>

94
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.710
<v Speaker 1>And I used to take the kids there like</v>
<v Speaker 1>at twilight and you know,</v>

95
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.520
<v Speaker 1>we creep around in there and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty scary and exciting for them.</v>

96
00:04:45.521 --> 00:04:47.500
<v Speaker 1>So it was sort of an Ick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scary and exciting place.</v>

97
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.090
<v Speaker 1>It was full of trees and so it was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown outside of our little house.</v>

98
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.970
<v Speaker 1>And so her dream said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the unknown had moved into the</v>

99
00:04:54.971 --> 00:04:57.940
<v Speaker 1>backyard in the form of a tree and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>tree burned down.</v>

100
00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.100
<v Speaker 1>And a tree is often a symbol of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>psyche.</v>

101
00:05:00.101 --> 00:05:03.190
<v Speaker 1>And it left the hall and the hall was</v>
<v Speaker 1>full of water and then the little baby</v>

102
00:05:03.191 --> 00:05:06.100
<v Speaker 1>went into the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dissolved and went into the water.</v>

103
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.660
<v Speaker 1>And then this weird bug guard them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was some alive thing,</v>

104
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.940
<v Speaker 1>bug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually,</v>

105
00:05:12.941 --> 00:05:15.100
<v Speaker 1>it was a bug like Jimminy cricket in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio,</v>

106
00:05:15.101 --> 00:05:16.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause that's a bug and it's abundant</v>

107
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.300
<v Speaker 1>leads transformation by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

108
00:05:19.301 --> 00:05:22.570
<v Speaker 1>the bug got him out and then he was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>big boy and what she was dealing with</v>

109
00:05:22.571 --> 00:05:24.580
<v Speaker 1>was the nature of radical</v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation.</v>

110
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:29.560
<v Speaker 1>How one thing could turn into something</v>
<v Speaker 1>different and then reconstitute itself</v>

111
00:05:29.561 --> 00:05:31.900
<v Speaker 1>as something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she did that on a symbolic level.</v>

112
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.730
<v Speaker 1>So what time is it?</v>

113
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.160
<v Speaker 3>Three rats.</v>

114
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.050
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'll tell you this little story for</v>

115
00:05:43.051 --> 00:05:46.290
<v Speaker 1>one minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had a five year old nephew and he</v>

116
00:05:46.291 --> 00:05:49.380
<v Speaker 1>was having night terrors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we'd wake up at night screaming and</v>

117
00:05:49.381 --> 00:05:51.030
<v Speaker 1>happened a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

118
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.310
<v Speaker 1>there was some trouble in his family at</v>
<v Speaker 1>that point.</v>

119
00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:55.500
<v Speaker 1>His parents ended up getting divorced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>

120
00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.600
<v Speaker 1>he'd wake up screaming and he also was</v>
<v Speaker 1>running around during the day with a</v>

121
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.790
<v Speaker 1>little night hat on and like a plastic</v>
<v Speaker 1>sword.</v>

122
00:06:01.791 --> 00:06:03.260
<v Speaker 1>And so he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe night,</v>

123
00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:03.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

124
00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.070
<v Speaker 1>and then when he went to bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had the little night out by him and</v>

125
00:06:07.071 --> 00:06:09.530
<v Speaker 1>also the sword.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one night when I was there,</v>

126
00:06:09.531 --> 00:06:11.630
<v Speaker 1>he had one of these night terrors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I will,</v>

127
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.400
<v Speaker 1>I was there that morning and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

128
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.800
<v Speaker 1>did you dream anything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is what he said,</v>

129
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.480
<v Speaker 1>dwarf like beat creatures who came up to</v>
<v Speaker 1>his knees,</v>

130
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.250
<v Speaker 1>had he was out in the field and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were like,</v>

131
00:06:22.251 --> 00:06:24.890
<v Speaker 1>so these little things about this big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had no arms,</v>

132
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.420
<v Speaker 1>they just had a big head that was beaky</v>
<v Speaker 1>a beak and they were jumping at him with</v>

133
00:06:29.421 --> 00:06:30.920
<v Speaker 1>the beak and like chomping him.</v>

134
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:35.450
<v Speaker 1>And on the top of their head they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was all hairy and greasy and on the</v>

135
00:06:35.451 --> 00:06:37.400
<v Speaker 1>top of their head they had a cross</v>
<v Speaker 1>shaved in it.</v>

136
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.130
<v Speaker 1>So it was like everybody shut up at that</v>
<v Speaker 1>breakfast.</v>

137
00:06:40.131 --> 00:06:41.030
<v Speaker 1>I can tell us like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

138
00:06:41.031 --> 00:06:42.160
<v Speaker 1>that's what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no,</v>

139
00:06:42.161 --> 00:06:45.800
<v Speaker 1>no wonder you're screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then so he is fighting away with</v>

140
00:06:45.801 --> 00:06:48.860
<v Speaker 1>these things and they're jumping on him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem was I said,</v>

141
00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.680
<v Speaker 1>he said he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a dragon in the background and</v>

142
00:06:51.681 --> 00:06:54.950
<v Speaker 1>what was happening was the dragon was</v>
<v Speaker 1>breathing out fire all the time and the</v>

143
00:06:54.951 --> 00:06:57.930
<v Speaker 1>fire and the smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're turning into these boring,</v>

144
00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:00.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little dwarf bird things that were</v>

145
00:07:00.351 --> 00:07:01.700
<v Speaker 1>biting him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like perfect,</v>

146
00:07:01.701 --> 00:07:03.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such a perfect representation.</v>

147
00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.360
<v Speaker 1>He can't fight off any one problem cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of pointless because there's</v>

148
00:07:08.361 --> 00:07:11.360
<v Speaker 1>something in the background generating</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems like mad.</v>

149
00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like a hydra cut off one head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven more grow.</v>

150
00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.780
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what could you do about that?</v>

151
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:19.550
<v Speaker 1>Which is a leading question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

152
00:07:19.551 --> 00:07:21.530
<v Speaker 1>Because it implies that he could do</v>
<v Speaker 1>something about that.</v>

153
00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:25.580
<v Speaker 1>So then he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would take my dad and we would go</v>

154
00:07:25.581 --> 00:07:28.400
<v Speaker 1>after the dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I jumped on his head and poke his eyes</v>

155
00:07:28.401 --> 00:07:32.540
<v Speaker 1>out with my sword and then I go down its</v>
<v Speaker 1>belly to where the fire comes out.</v>

156
00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:36.170
<v Speaker 1>And I'd carve out a piece of the firebox</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'd make a shield out of it.</v>

157
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:38.660
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

158
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.470
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

159
00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:43.640
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that's very</v>

160
00:07:43.641 --> 00:07:45.350
<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know this is hard to believe,</v>

161
00:07:45.351 --> 00:07:48.650
<v Speaker 1>but it's absolutely true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did not have any night terrors after</v>

162
00:07:48.651 --> 00:07:52.420
<v Speaker 1>that was extra cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was the leading question.</v>

163
00:07:52.421 --> 00:07:53.600
<v Speaker 1>It's cause he's like victim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

164
00:07:53.601 --> 00:07:54.530
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

165
00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:57.830
<v Speaker 1>horrible bird headed biting things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

166
00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:00.200
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's what the world's like.</v>

167
00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:03.680
<v Speaker 1>And then there's something in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>background generating these things.</v>

168
00:08:03.681 --> 00:08:07.130
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go to the source of the trouble and</v>

169
00:08:07.131 --> 00:08:11.140
<v Speaker 1>you find something that shields yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>from it in the encounter.</v>

170
00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.670
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
