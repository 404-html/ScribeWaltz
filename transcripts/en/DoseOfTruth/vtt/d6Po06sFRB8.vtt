1
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.570
<v Speaker 1>So Jacob is talking to God and God says,</v>

2
00:00:11.571 --> 00:00:11.961
<v Speaker 1>behold,</v>

3
00:00:11.961 --> 00:00:16.220
<v Speaker 1>I am with Jessie and it will keep the an old places where you go and bring you</v>

4
00:00:16.221 --> 00:00:19.250
<v Speaker 1>again into this land for I won't leave you until I have done that,</v>

5
00:00:19.251 --> 00:00:20.540
<v Speaker 1>which I have spoken to you of.</v>

6
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.880
<v Speaker 1>And Jacob awakened out of his sleep.</v>

7
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:25.161
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

8
00:00:25.161 --> 00:00:26.570
<v Speaker 1>surely the Lord is in this place.</v>

9
00:00:26.571 --> 00:00:27.381
<v Speaker 1>And I knew what not.</v>

10
00:00:27.381 --> 00:00:28.400
<v Speaker 1>And he was afraid and said,</v>

11
00:00:28.401 --> 00:00:29.930
<v Speaker 1>how dreadful is this place?</v>

12
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.680
<v Speaker 1>This is none other but the house of God and this is the gate of heaven.</v>

13
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.880
<v Speaker 1>And Jacob Rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put for</v>

14
00:00:37.881 --> 00:00:41.240
<v Speaker 1>his pillows and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on top of it.</v>

15
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:42.650
<v Speaker 1>That's a sacrifice.</v>

16
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.410
<v Speaker 1>And he called the name of that place Bethel.</v>

17
00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:47.780
<v Speaker 1>But the name of the city was called [inaudible] at the first.</v>

18
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.820
<v Speaker 1>And Jacob vowed a vow saying,</v>

19
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.310
<v Speaker 1>if God will be with me and we'll keep me in this way,</v>

20
00:00:52.311 --> 00:00:56.990
<v Speaker 1>that I go and will give me bread to eat and Raymond to put on so that I come</v>

21
00:00:56.991 --> 00:00:58.520
<v Speaker 1>again to my father's house in peace,</v>

22
00:00:58.521 --> 00:01:00.200
<v Speaker 1>then shall the Lord be my God.</v>

23
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:01.401
<v Speaker 1>And this stone,</v>

24
00:01:01.401 --> 00:01:03.620
<v Speaker 1>which are set for a pillar shall be God's house.</v>

25
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.170
<v Speaker 1>And of all of that that is given to me,</v>

26
00:01:06.171 --> 00:01:08.840
<v Speaker 1>I will surely give the 10th unto Thee.</v>

27
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.590
<v Speaker 1>And that's a pretty good place to stop.</v>

28
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.650
<v Speaker 1>So now I'll just</v>

29
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:18.793
<v Speaker 1>conclude.</v>

30
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.670
<v Speaker 1>So you have this very Morley ambivalent character,</v>

31
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

32
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.560
<v Speaker 1>Who's so far,</v>

33
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.370
<v Speaker 1>pretty much everything he's done that we're familiar with is not good.</v>

34
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:29.450
<v Speaker 1>So He's,</v>

35
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.100
<v Speaker 1>he's betrayed his brother horribly,</v>

36
00:01:31.101 --> 00:01:31.611
<v Speaker 1>twice,</v>

37
00:01:31.611 --> 00:01:33.020
<v Speaker 1>badly enough so that he,</v>

38
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.920
<v Speaker 1>his brother wants to kill him and everyone can kind of sympathize with his</v>

39
00:01:36.921 --> 00:01:37.754
<v Speaker 1>brother.</v>

40
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.600
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

41
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.230
<v Speaker 1>and then he runs away essentially because his mother tells him too,</v>

42
00:01:42.231 --> 00:01:44.720
<v Speaker 1>which is not exactly a testament to his character.</v>

43
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.310
<v Speaker 1>And despite that,</v>

44
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.410
<v Speaker 1>strangely enough,</v>

45
00:01:48.411 --> 00:01:49.850
<v Speaker 1>he has this experience,</v>

46
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.811
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

47
00:01:50.811 --> 00:01:52.850
<v Speaker 1>And that's heartening,</v>

48
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.013
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

49
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.580
<v Speaker 1>And that's the point is that</v>

50
00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.440
<v Speaker 1>people are predisposed to terrible error.</v>

51
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.820
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about that.</v>

52
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.193
<v Speaker 1>And yet</v>

53
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.040
<v Speaker 1>when I was writing my latest book,</v>

54
00:02:07.041 --> 00:02:08.060
<v Speaker 1>I had a friend of mine,</v>

55
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.550
<v Speaker 1>Norman Doidge wrote the foreword and enormous written a couple of great books</v>

56
00:02:13.551 --> 00:02:18.551
<v Speaker 1>and he's Jewish and he read some of what I'd written and he took me to task for</v>

57
00:02:19.611 --> 00:02:22.160
<v Speaker 1>making the God of the Old Testament,</v>

58
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.431
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

59
00:02:22.431 --> 00:02:25.340
<v Speaker 1>from a Christian perspective too harsh and unforgiving.</v>

60
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.620
<v Speaker 1>And I rewrote a fair bit of it because of his criticism and because of what I've</v>

61
00:02:30.621 --> 00:02:31.880
<v Speaker 1>learned doing these lectures,</v>

62
00:02:31.881 --> 00:02:34.010
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's not exactly right,</v>

63
00:02:34.011 --> 00:02:34.310
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

64
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean what happens in the Old Testament is if you screw up,</v>

65
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.000
<v Speaker 1>especially if you know you do and you decide that you're not going to do</v>

66
00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:41.661
<v Speaker 1>anything about it,</v>

67
00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:43.280
<v Speaker 1>so it's conscious and deliberate,</v>

68
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.620
<v Speaker 1>then look the hell out.</v>

69
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:46.790
<v Speaker 1>You are in serious trouble.</v>

70
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.210
<v Speaker 1>And I actually think that's also psychologically accurate.</v>

71
00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:51.800
<v Speaker 1>One of the things young pointed out,</v>

72
00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:52.820
<v Speaker 1>and this has always struck me,</v>

73
00:02:52.821 --> 00:02:55.460
<v Speaker 1>was that if you don't know what you're doing,</v>

74
00:02:55.461 --> 00:02:58.010
<v Speaker 1>this is actually in the gospel of Thomas as well.</v>

75
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.400
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly enough is one of the Gods Gnostic Gospels,</v>

76
00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:04.180
<v Speaker 1>Christ tells his followers something like if you make a mistake and you don't</v>

77
00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:04.871
<v Speaker 1>know what you're doing,</v>

78
00:03:04.871 --> 00:03:06.460
<v Speaker 1>then you'll be forgiven for it.</v>

79
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.840
<v Speaker 1>But if you make a mistake knowing what you're doing and you do it anyways,</v>

80
00:03:10.841 --> 00:03:13.640
<v Speaker 1>then like good luck to you and,</v>

81
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.671
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

82
00:03:14.671 --> 00:03:15.504
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's,</v>

83
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.353
<v Speaker 1>I think that's,</v>

84
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.760
<v Speaker 1>that's psychologically accurate.</v>

85
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.863
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

86
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.080
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that's very interesting about the judgemental God in the Old</v>

87
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.081
<v Speaker 1>Testament,</v>

88
00:03:29.081 --> 00:03:29.591
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

89
00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:31.990
<v Speaker 1>is that he can be bargained with.</v>

90
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.510
<v Speaker 1>And even if you make mistakes,</v>

91
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.760
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're unconscious of them,</v>

92
00:03:36.761 --> 00:03:37.870
<v Speaker 1>if you haven't learned yet,</v>

93
00:03:37.871 --> 00:03:38.650
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

94
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.390
<v Speaker 1>then you always have the opportunity to return to the proper path.</v>

95
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.590
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

96
00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.180
<v Speaker 1>people get cynical about that cause there's,</v>

97
00:03:46.181 --> 00:03:46.391
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

98
00:03:46.391 --> 00:03:50.290
<v Speaker 1>this mostly Christian idea that you could live a terribly sinful life,</v>

99
00:03:50.291 --> 00:03:51.790
<v Speaker 1>but if you repented on your death bed,</v>

100
00:03:51.791 --> 00:03:52.840
<v Speaker 1>it's like heaven for you.</v>

101
00:03:52.841 --> 00:03:53.420
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

102
00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.100
<v Speaker 1>oh that's,</v>

103
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.480
<v Speaker 1>that sounds like a great deal.</v>

104
00:03:55.481 --> 00:03:55.691
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

105
00:03:55.691 --> 00:03:59.350
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can do whatever the hell you want until just before you die.</v>

106
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.120
<v Speaker 1>Of course you might not know when that is.</v>

107
00:04:01.121 --> 00:04:02.050
<v Speaker 1>So that's a problem.</v>

108
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.621
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

109
00:04:02.621 --> 00:04:03.311
<v Speaker 1>then you can just say,</v>

110
00:04:03.311 --> 00:04:03.491
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

111
00:04:03.491 --> 00:04:04.151
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

112
00:04:04.151 --> 00:04:04.691
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

113
00:04:04.691 --> 00:04:05.471
<v Speaker 1>everything's forgiven.</v>

114
00:04:05.471 --> 00:04:08.620
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with being cynical about that sort of thing is that it's no</v>

115
00:04:08.621 --> 00:04:10.150
<v Speaker 1>trivial matter to repent,</v>

116
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.680
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

117
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.680
<v Speaker 1>Because to repent means a figure out what you actually did and the worst things</v>

118
00:04:17.171 --> 00:04:18.004
<v Speaker 1>that you did,</v>

119
00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.560
<v Speaker 1>the more horrible it is to figure it out.</v>

120
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:21.790
<v Speaker 1>It's no joke,</v>

121
00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:22.061
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

122
00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:25.930
<v Speaker 1>And there's no genuine repentance without understanding of the depth of your</v>

123
00:04:25.931 --> 00:04:26.764
<v Speaker 1>depravity.</v>

124
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.130
<v Speaker 1>And so if you lived to particularly reprehensible life and you come to</v>

125
00:04:32.501 --> 00:04:33.400
<v Speaker 1>understand it,</v>

126
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.070
<v Speaker 1>I think that in and of itself could kill you.</v>

127
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.671
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

128
00:04:36.671 --> 00:04:41.020
<v Speaker 1>it's a terrible thing to wake up and see what you've done.</v>

129
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.120
<v Speaker 1>If what you've done is truly terrible.</v>
