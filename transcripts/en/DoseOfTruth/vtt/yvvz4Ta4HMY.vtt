00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.680
<v Speaker 1>Those are the viewers who don't know.</v>

2
00:00:01.681 --> 00:00:04.980
<v Speaker 1>Headstart was a nationwide attempt to,</v>

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.400
<v Speaker 1>to add additional education to the lives of disadvantaged kids,</v>

4
00:00:10.411 --> 00:00:11.041
<v Speaker 1>especially,</v>

5
00:00:11.041 --> 00:00:11.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:12.080
<v Speaker 1>at the,</v>

7
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.230
<v Speaker 1>at the preschool level.</v>

8
00:00:13.231 --> 00:00:15.210
<v Speaker 1>And basically what happened,</v>

9
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.890
<v Speaker 1>what was that they actually did show improvements in academic achievement</v>

10
00:00:19.891 --> 00:00:20.724
<v Speaker 1>initially.</v>

11
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.090
<v Speaker 1>So in grade one and grade two they were performing above their peers.</v>

12
00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:26.580
<v Speaker 1>But then the difference in improvement,</v>

13
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.090
<v Speaker 1>the difference in performance started to decrease and then by both the grade</v>

14
00:00:30.091 --> 00:00:30.661
<v Speaker 1>grade five,</v>

15
00:00:30.661 --> 00:00:33.240
<v Speaker 1>grade six that differences and disappeared completely.</v>

16
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.520
<v Speaker 1>So there was no evidence whatsoever of that,</v>

17
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.820
<v Speaker 1>of that either have a stable one time,</v>

18
00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:43.350
<v Speaker 1>longterm gain in cognitive ability or what people were really hoping was that if</v>

19
00:00:43.351 --> 00:00:44.670
<v Speaker 1>you intervene early enough,</v>

20
00:00:44.671 --> 00:00:45.960
<v Speaker 1>you get something that would sort of,</v>

21
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.400
<v Speaker 1>Paul would turn into a positive feedback loop and the gains would actually</v>

22
00:00:50.401 --> 00:00:51.810
<v Speaker 1>advance across time.</v>

23
00:00:51.811 --> 00:00:55.920
<v Speaker 1>And what ended up happening with the headstart research basically was the</v>

24
00:00:55.921 --> 00:00:58.830
<v Speaker 1>conclusion that it produced no cognitive improvements whatsoever.</v>

25
00:00:58.831 --> 00:01:01.570
<v Speaker 1>Although more kids who went through headstart,</v>

26
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.400
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

27
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.810
<v Speaker 1>graduated from high school,</v>

28
00:01:03.811 --> 00:01:05.040
<v Speaker 1>fewer of them were delinquent,</v>

29
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.903
<v Speaker 1>more of them,</v>

30
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.790
<v Speaker 1>fewer of them became pregnant teenage in the teenage years.</v>

31
00:01:08.791 --> 00:01:10.380
<v Speaker 1>And more of them went to colleges.</v>

32
00:01:10.381 --> 00:01:13.110
<v Speaker 1>But that seemed to be because they were better socialized,</v>

33
00:01:13.111 --> 00:01:14.730
<v Speaker 1>not because they were in any way.</v>

34
00:01:14.731 --> 00:01:15.900
<v Speaker 1>It had been made smarter.</v>

35
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.220
<v Speaker 1>So that was a really tremendous disappointment because it was a bipartisan</v>

36
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.660
<v Speaker 1>attempt to come to grips with the fundamental issues that sort of be deviled</v>

37
00:01:24.661 --> 00:01:26.580
<v Speaker 1>structural poverty in the United States.</v>

38
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.340
<v Speaker 1>No one was happy about that outcome.</v>

39
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.980
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you.</v>
