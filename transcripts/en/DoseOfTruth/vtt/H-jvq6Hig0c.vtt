1
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.040
<v Speaker 1>The other thing that's interesting about that is that what's happened is that</v>

2
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.060
<v Speaker 1>the people who have these radical viewpoints have been given a permanent sign it</v>

3
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.150
<v Speaker 1>cure right there,</v>

4
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.690
<v Speaker 1>there their state and tuition sponsored activists who can spend every single</v>

5
00:00:25.101 --> 00:00:30.101
<v Speaker 1>moment of their time on what I would consider their fifth call them agenda.</v>

6
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.840
<v Speaker 1>So we're basically funding a cohort of people who stated purpose is to demolish</v>

7
00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:37.870
<v Speaker 1>the patriarchy.</v>

8
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

9
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.610
<v Speaker 1>one of the things Carl Jung said,</v>

11
00:00:41.611 --> 00:00:44.040
<v Speaker 1>which I really liked and haven't talked about that much,</v>

12
00:00:44.041 --> 00:00:49.041
<v Speaker 1>is that the unconscious representation of men in the female psyche,</v>

13
00:00:49.431 --> 00:00:54.431
<v Speaker 1>he called the animus and the animus was always in his estimation because of the</v>

14
00:00:54.971 --> 00:00:58.930
<v Speaker 1>dream analysis he did and so forth that that although the unconscious</v>

15
00:00:58.931 --> 00:01:02.620
<v Speaker 1>representation of a woman in a man's psyche was an individual woman,</v>

16
00:01:02.621 --> 00:01:07.621
<v Speaker 1>the unconscious representation of the male psyche in the females unconscious was</v>

17
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.130
<v Speaker 1>men as a group.</v>

18
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.800
<v Speaker 1>And there's a very large number of women and also some men whose conception of</v>

19
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.470
<v Speaker 1>male yes is,</v>

20
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.400
<v Speaker 1>has been damaged very badly by their failure to establish any positive</v>

21
00:01:24.401 --> 00:01:27.520
<v Speaker 1>relationship with any male whatsoever in their developmental history.</v>

22
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.320
<v Speaker 1>And then they project this paranoid representation of what constitutes</v>

23
00:01:32.321 --> 00:01:36.780
<v Speaker 1>hierarchical masculinity onto the world and then fight,</v>

24
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:38.243
<v Speaker 1>bring it down.</v>

25
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:39.383
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

26
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.840
<v Speaker 1>and the thing is they're being successful.</v>

27
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.970
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem is this is,</v>

28
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.730
<v Speaker 2>this is another one when I was actually,</v>

29
00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.130
<v Speaker 2>I know that you are very popular with the,</v>

30
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:52.620
<v Speaker 2>a lot of young men,</v>

31
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.470
<v Speaker 2>but I was actually introduced to you by a,</v>

32
00:01:55.471 --> 00:01:56.370
<v Speaker 2>a mother too.</v>

33
00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.070
<v Speaker 2>So professor in,</v>

34
00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

35
00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.220
<v Speaker 2>in education.</v>

36
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.840
<v Speaker 2>So she's really,</v>

37
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.210
<v Speaker 2>she's not in her,</v>

38
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

39
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.021
<v Speaker 2>at the,</v>

40
00:02:04.021 --> 00:02:04.710
<v Speaker 2>at home,</v>

41
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.311
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

42
00:02:05.311 --> 00:02:06.650
<v Speaker 2>ideologically or a,</v>

43
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.891
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

44
00:02:07.891 --> 00:02:08.724
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

45
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.650
<v Speaker 2>one thing that's worrying me is,</v>

46
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:14.623
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

47
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:16.740
<v Speaker 2>there are certain,</v>

48
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.100
<v Speaker 2>certain parts of certain ideologies that take on a religious overtones though.</v>

49
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.320
<v Speaker 2>And I think that feminism has some of those characteristics.</v>

50
00:02:28.321 --> 00:02:28.581
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

51
00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:29.290
<v Speaker 2>in Christian,</v>

52
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.970
<v Speaker 2>they were all born sinful and we need to come to grips with our sinfulness.</v>

53
00:02:32.971 --> 00:02:33.804
<v Speaker 2>And in the end,</v>

54
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.240
<v Speaker 2>only God's grace and forgiveness can redeem us.</v>

55
00:02:36.241 --> 00:02:37.074
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

56
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.481
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

57
00:02:37.481 --> 00:02:37.811
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

58
00:02:37.811 --> 00:02:39.660
<v Speaker 2>in Lutheranism at least a,</v>

59
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:40.061
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

60
00:02:40.061 --> 00:02:40.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

61
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.991
<v Speaker 2>we don't,</v>

62
00:02:40.991 --> 00:02:41.291
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>

63
00:02:41.291 --> 00:02:43.570
<v Speaker 2>we can be forgiven by priests is only God.</v>

64
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.923
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

65
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.760
<v Speaker 1>Doctrine.</v>

66
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.593
<v Speaker 1>There's no escape.</v>

67
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.940
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

68
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.940
<v Speaker 2>I totally sympathize with it even though I don't in a lot of ways,</v>

69
00:02:53.101 --> 00:02:53.371
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

70
00:02:53.371 --> 00:02:53.700
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

71
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.533
<v Speaker 2>I realized,</v>

72
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:55.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

73
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.740
<v Speaker 2>but within feminist and the sin is situated within instead,</v>

74
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:00.663
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

75
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.320
<v Speaker 1>not only with within males,</v>

76
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:04.270
<v Speaker 1>but within nails as a collective,</v>

77
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:05.760
<v Speaker 1>which has even seen,</v>

78
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.550
<v Speaker 1>the thing about the Christian doctrine that you referred to is that it makes</v>

79
00:03:09.551 --> 00:03:12.100
<v Speaker 1>each individual responsible for their own darkness.</v>

80
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.260
<v Speaker 1>Now the Catholics say,</v>

81
00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:14.561
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

82
00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:17.530
<v Speaker 1>that's unbearable and people need to have the slate wiped clean.</v>

83
00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:19.390
<v Speaker 1>Now in that and confessional do that,</v>

84
00:03:19.391 --> 00:03:23.350
<v Speaker 1>and there's an intermediary and Yeoman considered that merciful.</v>

85
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.080
<v Speaker 1>And there's some real power in that argument.</v>

86
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:26.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

87
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:27.700
<v Speaker 1>that the cynical argument is,</v>

88
00:03:27.701 --> 00:03:27.971
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

89
00:03:27.971 --> 00:03:31.780
<v Speaker 1>you can just wipe the slate clean at any time and you don't have to bear any</v>

90
00:03:31.781 --> 00:03:32.620
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>

91
00:03:32.621 --> 00:03:33.940
<v Speaker 1>But I think that's cynical.</v>

92
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.420
<v Speaker 1>The Protestants put themselves in a much tougher position because there's no</v>

93
00:03:37.421 --> 00:03:38.254
<v Speaker 1>escape.</v>

94
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.190
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

95
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.930
<v Speaker 1>but the upside of all of that is,</v>

96
00:03:40.931 --> 00:03:43.900
<v Speaker 1>is that the darkness is to be regarded as within,</v>

97
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.853
<v Speaker 1>not without.</v>

98
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:46.140
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

99
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.040
<v Speaker 1>and as soon as you move away from that,</v>

100
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.320
<v Speaker 1>then while you're,</v>

101
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:50.800
<v Speaker 1>you're the good person.</v>

102
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.170
<v Speaker 1>And so is everyone that thinks like you.</v>

103
00:03:53.171 --> 00:03:56.020
<v Speaker 1>And all the evil is wherever you want to put it.</v>

104
00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.940
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

105
00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.550
<v Speaker 1>and then as soon as the thing that's really dangerous about that,</v>

106
00:04:00.551 --> 00:04:05.551
<v Speaker 1>especially if the evil is conceptualized as contemptible and parasitic and using</v>

107
00:04:07.511 --> 00:04:08.890
<v Speaker 1>disgust related language,</v>

108
00:04:08.891 --> 00:04:09.551
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

109
00:04:09.551 --> 00:04:11.080
<v Speaker 1>instead of fear related language,</v>

110
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.440
<v Speaker 1>then the logical directive is to purify it.</v>

111
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:17.860
<v Speaker 1>And boy,</v>

112
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.903
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

113
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.740
<v Speaker 1>that's not good.</v>
