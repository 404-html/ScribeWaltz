1
00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.480
<v Speaker 1>Opens up a whole can a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very interesting issues.</v>

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.270
<v Speaker 1>This try and pick a couple of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the [inaudible] hard to,</v>

3
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.210
<v Speaker 1>it's evident to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm enormously encouraged by this</v>

4
00:00:10.211 --> 00:00:10.691
<v Speaker 1>because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5
00:00:10.691 --> 00:00:14.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm a passionate Australia and I'd want</v>
<v Speaker 1>this country to be the sort of place</v>

6
00:00:14.261 --> 00:00:17.410
<v Speaker 1>that offers opportunities of the sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I had when I was young.</v>

7
00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.960
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had my opportunities when I look at</v>

8
00:00:19.961 --> 00:00:22.960
<v Speaker 1>my kids' generation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going to be there for them if we</v>

9
00:00:22.961 --> 00:00:27.961
<v Speaker 1>keep feeding them the sort of thin grew</v>
<v Speaker 1>in reality,</v>

10
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.850
<v Speaker 1>the people turning out in vast numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every one of your talks in Australia's</v>

11
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.040
<v Speaker 1>been oversubscribed massively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It tells you they kind of get those more</v>

12
00:00:38.771 --> 00:00:40.600
<v Speaker 1>to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're being tall.</v>

13
00:00:40.601 --> 00:00:40.820
<v Speaker 1>Oh</v>

14
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.050
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know well.</v>

15
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.330
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the things that's so</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting about dealing with</v>

16
00:00:44.331 --> 00:00:47.030
<v Speaker 2>archetipal themes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know archetipal themes are</v>

17
00:00:47.031 --> 00:00:51.350
<v Speaker 2>archetipal because they actually speak</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the structure of human experience.</v>

18
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.790
<v Speaker 2>That's why they last.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's human nature and human</v>

19
00:00:55.791 --> 00:00:59.540
<v Speaker 2>experience has a pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have the capacity to do</v>

20
00:00:59.541 --> 00:01:03.230
<v Speaker 2>articulate that pattern as an individual</v>
<v Speaker 2>in part because your life is too short.</v>

21
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.020
<v Speaker 2>You just can't figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

22
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.040
<v Speaker 2>the ancient representations of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns are everywhere around you and</v>

23
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.821
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

24
00:01:10.821 --> 00:01:11.950
<v Speaker 2>some of them in the image,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

25
00:01:11.951 --> 00:01:14.330
<v Speaker 2>you caught onto them automatically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

26
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.500
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you fall into them.</v>

27
00:01:15.501 --> 00:01:16.880
<v Speaker 2>If you go to a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

28
00:01:16.881 --> 00:01:18.980
<v Speaker 2>because movies always expressed</v>
<v Speaker 2>archetipal themes.</v>

29
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.010
<v Speaker 2>If you hear them articulate it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>

30
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.060
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew that.</v>

31
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.160
<v Speaker 2>I knew that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just didn't know how to say it.</v>

32
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.220
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the platonic idea of,</v>

33
00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:28.323
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

34
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.590
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of learning as remembering your,</v>

35
00:01:30.591 --> 00:01:33.890
<v Speaker 2>your soul already knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't have the words.</v>

36
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.900
<v Speaker 2>And so when people talk to me about</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching my lectures,</v>

37
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.410
<v Speaker 2>let's say they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they basically say one of two things.</v>

38
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.540
<v Speaker 2>If it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's not just a simple thank you.</v>

39
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.360
<v Speaker 2>They say one of two things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A third of them say,</v>

40
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.900
<v Speaker 2>quarter of them say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I listen to you talk,</v>

41
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.750
<v Speaker 2>it's as if you're telling me things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I already know.</v>

42
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.891
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

43
00:01:54.891 --> 00:01:58.100
<v Speaker 2>well that's exactly right because that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>what archetipal stories are there.</v>

44
00:01:58.101 --> 00:01:59.870
<v Speaker 2>The description of what you already</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

45
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.970
<v Speaker 2>but that can be articulated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then who you are and how you see</v>

46
00:02:04.971 --> 00:02:08.630
<v Speaker 2>yourself and the way you described</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself all become the same thing.</v>

47
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.270
<v Speaker 2>So that's wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you're not at odds with yourself,</v>

48
00:02:11.271 --> 00:02:12.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you have,</v>

49
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.320
<v Speaker 2>then you're a functioning unity and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes you much stronger and more</v>

50
00:02:15.321 --> 00:02:18.530
<v Speaker 2>indomitable than you would otherwise be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the other thing that people</v>

51
00:02:18.531 --> 00:02:20.210
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is more like three quarters of</v>

52
00:02:20.211 --> 00:02:22.190
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that they say,</v>

53
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.050
<v Speaker 2>I was in a very dark place.</v>

54
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.280
<v Speaker 2>I was addicted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

55
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.700
<v Speaker 2>I was drinking too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a fragmented relationship with my</v>

56
00:02:28.701 --> 00:02:31.040
<v Speaker 2>fiance and I wasn't getting married.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

57
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.990
<v Speaker 2>things weren't going very well with my</v>
<v Speaker 2>family.</v>

58
00:02:32.991 --> 00:02:35.030
<v Speaker 2>My relationship with my father was</v>
<v Speaker 2>damaged.</v>

59
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.880
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have any AME.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was wasting my time.</v>

60
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.700
<v Speaker 2>Some variant of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some combination of those.</v>

61
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.260
<v Speaker 2>And they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

62
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.330
<v Speaker 2>I've been watching your lectures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've decided to establish a purpose.</v>

63
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to tell the truth and things</v>
<v Speaker 2>are way better.</v>

64
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.380
<v Speaker 2>And I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so let's say I've done maybe eight</v>

65
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.170
<v Speaker 2>or nine large scale public talks in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>last two months.</v>

66
00:02:57.171 --> 00:03:02.171
<v Speaker 2>So that's probably 20,000 and about half</v>
<v Speaker 2>of them a third to half of the misstate</v>

67
00:03:02.231 --> 00:03:05.260
<v Speaker 2>afterwards to talk to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's about 7,000 people who have</v>

68
00:03:05.261 --> 00:03:07.750
<v Speaker 2>said that to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then people stop me on the street</v>

69
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.910
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And tell me exactly that story,</v>

70
00:03:09.911 --> 00:03:11.140
<v Speaker 2>which is just wonderful.</v>

71
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.010
<v Speaker 2>Like you can't imagine how good it is to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be able to go to places you've never</v>

72
00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:17.140
<v Speaker 2>been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to have people start peeling the</v>

73
00:03:17.141 --> 00:03:19.600
<v Speaker 2>streets spontaneously and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

74
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.150
<v Speaker 2>my life is way better than it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

75
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.610
<v Speaker 2>it's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

76
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.990
<v Speaker 2>and I've got like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

77
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.050
<v Speaker 2>35,000 letters from people since last</v>
<v Speaker 2>August.</v>

78
00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:30.790
<v Speaker 2>It's more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't keep track of them.</v>

79
00:03:30.791 --> 00:03:34.240
<v Speaker 2>And it's exactly the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like three quarter quarter of them say,</v>

80
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.160
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've given me the words to say what I</v>

81
00:03:36.161 --> 00:03:38.470
<v Speaker 2>already knew was true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And thank you for that.</v>

82
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.620
<v Speaker 2>I can see that in the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so interesting because I can lay</v>

83
00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:44.020
<v Speaker 2>out a story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People go like this and say they're</v>

84
00:03:44.021 --> 00:03:46.360
<v Speaker 2>doing that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the lights are going on.</v>

85
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.150
<v Speaker 2>And that's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while there's no,</v>

86
00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.250
<v Speaker 2>almost nothing better than that to watch</v>
<v Speaker 2>lights go on when you're talking to</v>

87
00:03:51.251 --> 00:03:53.290
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like that's just absolutely</v>

88
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.340
<v Speaker 2>fantastic.</v>

89
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.940
<v Speaker 2>But to get this response from people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my father,</v>

90
00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.650
<v Speaker 2>I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my father is about 80,</v>

91
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.140
<v Speaker 2>80 is 83,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

92
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.660
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] 81,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's 81.</v>

93
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.100
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put it in charge of,</v>

94
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.610
<v Speaker 2>of going through my viewer email,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

95
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.020
<v Speaker 2>which is an overwhelming job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But now we've had discussions about this</v>

96
00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:16.720
<v Speaker 2>constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's overwhelmed by the fact that so</v>

97
00:04:16.721 --> 00:04:18.790
<v Speaker 2>many people are writing and saying the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same thing.</v>

98
00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:19.624
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

99
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.990
<v Speaker 2>I have a purpose in my life actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>matters.</v>

100
00:04:22.991 --> 00:04:26.620
<v Speaker 2>I finally realized that and I'm putting</v>
<v Speaker 2>it into practice and I'm bearing up</v>

101
00:04:26.621 --> 00:04:29.860
<v Speaker 2>under the heaviest load I can imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's really helping.</v>

102
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.890
<v Speaker 2>It's like God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's tens of thousands of</v>

103
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.950
<v Speaker 2>responses now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

104
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.160
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't hope for anything better</v>

105
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.650
<v Speaker 2>than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's zero harm in it,</v>

106
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.240
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just people putting their lives</v>

107
00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:45.310
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not mucking about with other</v>

108
00:04:45.311 --> 00:04:49.240
<v Speaker 2>people and are trying to make broad</v>
<v Speaker 2>scale social transformations about which</v>

109
00:04:49.241 --> 00:04:50.110
<v Speaker 2>they have no idea.</v>

110
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.730
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to make their immediate</v>
<v Speaker 2>environment better and it's working.</v>

111
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.920
<v Speaker 2>It's like great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

112
00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.880
<v Speaker 2>You say the zero harm in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say as a former legislator that there's</v>

113
00:05:00.881 --> 00:05:03.440
<v Speaker 2>an enormous amount of good at a country</v>
<v Speaker 2>is only the,</v>

114
00:05:03.441 --> 00:05:07.110
<v Speaker 2>some title of the people that make it up</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the extent that they put together</v>

115
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.980
<v Speaker 2>resilient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I only contribute,</v>

116
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.160
<v Speaker 2>don't have to ask others to help them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The stronger the nation and rapidly like</v>

117
00:05:16.841 --> 00:05:19.150
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think I was thinking the other</v>

118
00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.340
<v Speaker 2>day some a journalist asked me why the</v>
<v Speaker 2>audience,</v>

119
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.010
<v Speaker 2>why people are responding so positively</v>
<v Speaker 2>to what I'm saying,</v>

120
00:05:24.011 --> 00:05:25.630
<v Speaker 2>the young men for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I thought,</v>

121
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:26.621
<v Speaker 2>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

122
00:05:26.621 --> 00:05:27.071
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

123
00:05:27.071 --> 00:05:28.530
<v Speaker 2>that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

124
00:05:28.531 --> 00:05:30.370
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually on their side.</v>

125
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty happy that I'm really happy</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're not wasting their lives.</v>

126
00:05:35.621 --> 00:05:39.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm really sad to see that people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>disenchanted and nihilistic and</v>

127
00:05:39.251 --> 00:05:43.430
<v Speaker 2>depressed and anxious and aimless and</v>
<v Speaker 2>and perverse and vengeful and,</v>

128
00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.400
<v Speaker 2>and all of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's terrible.</v>

129
00:05:45.401 --> 00:05:50.401
<v Speaker 2>And then to see people question whether</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's necessary and then to start to</v>

130
00:05:50.861 --> 00:05:52.090
<v Speaker 2>rise out of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

131
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.900
<v Speaker 2>it's so fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like last night I was at after my talk.</v>

132
00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.823
<v Speaker 2>It's overwhelming.</v>

133
00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't usually think about these</v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

134
00:06:03.731 --> 00:06:05.860
<v Speaker 2>but I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was after my talk last night,</v>

135
00:06:05.861 --> 00:06:07.780
<v Speaker 2>didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all these people line up and you</v>

136
00:06:07.781 --> 00:06:10.390
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have their fifteens 15 seconds with</v>

137
00:06:10.391 --> 00:06:12.550
<v Speaker 2>me and they're kind of tentative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're excited in a tentative,</v>

138
00:06:12.551 --> 00:06:14.170
<v Speaker 2>when they come up to talk to me and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have,</v>

139
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>15 seconds of time to tell me something.</v>

140
00:06:16.241 --> 00:06:20.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm really listening to them and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>hesitant about whether or not to share</v>

141
00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.450
<v Speaker 2>the good news about their life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

142
00:06:22.451 --> 00:06:24.100
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's often because</v>

143
00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:25.610
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

144
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.250
<v Speaker 2>when people share good news about their</v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

145
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.000
<v Speaker 2>people don't necessarily respond</v>
<v Speaker 2>positively.</v>

146
00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.030
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't get encouragement and people</v>

147
00:06:35.031 --> 00:06:38.660
<v Speaker 2>need so little encouragement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just unbelievable.</v>

148
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.750
<v Speaker 2>And so they'll tell me something good</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think,</v>

149
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:41.690
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's so good.</v>

150
00:06:41.691 --> 00:06:42.590
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody says,</v>

151
00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.270
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting along way better with my</v>

152
00:06:44.271 --> 00:06:46.190
<v Speaker 2>father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen him for 10 years and now</v>

153
00:06:46.191 --> 00:06:48.710
<v Speaker 2>we get along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like crate.</v>

154
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:52.520
<v Speaker 2>And then the power of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't overstate the power of that</v>

155
00:06:52.521 --> 00:06:55.370
<v Speaker 2>for individuals to get their life</v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

156
00:06:55.371 --> 00:06:58.340
<v Speaker 2>They individuals an unbelievably</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful force.</v>

157
00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:02.300
<v Speaker 2>And every single person who gets their</v>
<v Speaker 2>act together a little bit has the</v>

158
00:07:02.301 --> 00:07:04.970
<v Speaker 2>capacity to spread that around them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

159
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.620
<v Speaker 2>it's a chain reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's a lovely thing to see and</v>

160
00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:10.730
<v Speaker 2>that's fantastic.</v>
