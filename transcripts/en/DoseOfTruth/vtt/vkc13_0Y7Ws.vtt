1
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.110
<v Speaker 1>One of the things we do know is that,</v>

2
00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:09.223
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:14.270
<v Speaker 1>as you stretch out the inequality you make men particularly on the lower end of</v>

4
00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:16.740
<v Speaker 1>the distribution,</v>

5
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.900
<v Speaker 1>more and more likely to be aggressive.</v>

6
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.620
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of like imagine every man has a threshold for violence.</v>

7
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:23.730
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

8
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.070
<v Speaker 1>and status is important,</v>

9
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.510
<v Speaker 1>demand knocked that it's not important to women,</v>

10
00:00:27.511 --> 00:00:29.190
<v Speaker 1>but it's different.</v>

11
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.990
<v Speaker 1>It's a different kind of status.</v>

12
00:00:30.991 --> 00:00:34.500
<v Speaker 1>It status is important to men because it's one of the things that makes them</v>

13
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.870
<v Speaker 1>marketable as partners to women.</v>

14
00:00:36.871 --> 00:00:39.090
<v Speaker 1>So it actually turns out to be quite important to Mandan.</v>

15
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.870
<v Speaker 1>Men tend to compete with one another for status,</v>

16
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.160
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy position and in a really unequal society.</v>

17
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.700
<v Speaker 1>If you're like a low rung guy then and you don't have any opportunity to rise</v>

18
00:00:53.461 --> 00:00:58.080
<v Speaker 1>because the society isn't structured so that there's mobility,</v>

19
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.470
<v Speaker 1>then the more aggressive guys tend to turn into criminality and you know,</v>

20
00:01:04.381 --> 00:01:09.381
<v Speaker 1>and so you could say there's a threshold for criminality and the more inequality</v>

21
00:01:10.111 --> 00:01:13.740
<v Speaker 1>pressure you put on a particular area,</v>

22
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.570
<v Speaker 1>geographic or political area,</v>

23
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.880
<v Speaker 1>the more inequality pressure you put on it,</v>

24
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.130
<v Speaker 1>the more men slip past that threshold and into criminality.</v>

25
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.971
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

26
00:01:23.971 --> 00:01:28.971
<v Speaker 1>there's been pretty good studies done of drug gang in Chicago.</v>

27
00:01:29.041 --> 00:01:32.430
<v Speaker 1>That was the best one is sociologist actually went and hung out with a drug gang</v>

28
00:01:32.431 --> 00:01:32.970
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

29
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:33.810
<v Speaker 1>he got into it.</v>

30
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.120
<v Speaker 1>I guess the drug gang leader was,</v>

31
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.043
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

32
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.460
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say necessarily narcissistic,</v>

33
00:01:41.461 --> 00:01:44.040
<v Speaker 1>but that might be a reasonable way of thinking about it.</v>

34
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.700
<v Speaker 1>And he was kind of happy with the idea of maybe being a subject of a book and,</v>

35
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.890
<v Speaker 1>and so this guy was able to associate with them,</v>

36
00:01:55.891 --> 00:01:57.270
<v Speaker 1>got to know them quite well.</v>

37
00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.780
<v Speaker 1>And then the housing project in which the gang was housed was slated for</v>

38
00:02:02.881 --> 00:02:07.881
<v Speaker 1>demolition and the gang broke up and he got the books because they kept books.</v>

39
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.340
<v Speaker 1>And what he found was the average street drug dealer,</v>

40
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.370
<v Speaker 1>first of all was employed in another job as well and was making far less than</v>

41
00:02:17.671 --> 00:02:19.710
<v Speaker 1>minimum wage now.</v>

42
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:20.820
<v Speaker 1>But the guy is,</v>

43
00:02:20.821 --> 00:02:21.091
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:02:21.091 --> 00:02:25.110
<v Speaker 1>further up the chain of course followed the Prieto distribution.</v>

45
00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:28.350
<v Speaker 1>And so there was a tiny minority of them who were raking in a tremendous amount</v>

46
00:02:28.351 --> 00:02:29.184
<v Speaker 1>of loot.</v>

47
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.410
<v Speaker 1>And the guys at the bottom,</v>

48
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.850
<v Speaker 1>we're just waiting around for the possibility that they could rise up the</v>

49
00:02:35.851 --> 00:02:36.780
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy and you know,</v>

50
00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:37.990
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty violent game.</v>

51
00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:40.830
<v Speaker 1>So the chances that someone is going to be</v>

52
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.660
<v Speaker 1>taken out is pretty high and then a little slot opens up for some opportunistic</v>

53
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.590
<v Speaker 1>second rater and perhaps he can move up the hierarchy.</v>
