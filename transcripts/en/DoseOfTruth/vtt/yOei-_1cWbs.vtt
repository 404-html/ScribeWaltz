1
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.510
<v Speaker 1>Are there ever situations where you should hold your tongue and not speak what</v>

2
00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:12.344
<v Speaker 1>you believe?</v>

3
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:13.243
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:13.970
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

5
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:15.260
<v Speaker 1>most of the time,</v>

6
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.210
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

7
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.140
<v Speaker 1>it's really a tricky thing to figure out when to say what you have to say.</v>

8
00:00:21.141 --> 00:00:23.390
<v Speaker 1>But I can give you a couple of rules of thumb.</v>

9
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.020
<v Speaker 1>It's a general question name and I can't list all the situations,</v>

10
00:00:27.021 --> 00:00:28.970
<v Speaker 1>but I can give you some strategic advice.</v>

11
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:30.260
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

12
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.150
<v Speaker 1>if someone is,</v>

13
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.053
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

14
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.340
<v Speaker 1>has said rude things to you,</v>

15
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.353
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

16
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.830
<v Speaker 1>says a rude thing to you,</v>

17
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.100
<v Speaker 1>maybe you shouldn't respond immediately even though you're very irritated</v>

18
00:00:43.101 --> 00:00:47.660
<v Speaker 1>because maybe that's just an impulsive response and one that you'll regret when</v>

19
00:00:47.661 --> 00:00:49.160
<v Speaker 1>you make an anger that you'll regret.</v>

20
00:00:49.161 --> 00:00:53.120
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say when you're dealing with someone and you want to chastise</v>

21
00:00:53.121 --> 00:00:53.720
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

22
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.660
<v Speaker 1>then you should wait for them to cin three times,</v>

23
00:00:56.661 --> 00:00:56.961
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

24
00:00:56.961 --> 00:00:59.270
<v Speaker 1>So the first time they're rude to you think,</v>

25
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:00.170
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

26
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.420
<v Speaker 1>well they're probably having a bad day,</v>

27
00:01:02.421 --> 00:01:03.620
<v Speaker 1>or I misunderstood,</v>

28
00:01:03.621 --> 00:01:04.470
<v Speaker 1>or I'm,</v>

29
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:05.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm rude sometimes too.</v>

30
00:01:05.961 --> 00:01:06.681
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

31
00:01:06.681 --> 00:01:07.520
<v Speaker 1>I'll just let it go.</v>

32
00:01:07.521 --> 00:01:10.040
<v Speaker 1>But you don't forget and you don't pretend it didn't happen.</v>

33
00:01:10.041 --> 00:01:12.320
<v Speaker 1>And then it happens again.</v>

34
00:01:12.321 --> 00:01:13.154
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>

35
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:14.230
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

36
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.790
<v Speaker 1>well that could still be fluke.</v>

37
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:16.870
<v Speaker 1>That could still be</v>

38
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.830
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

39
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.360
<v Speaker 1>That could still be situational.</v>

40
00:01:20.361 --> 00:01:22.600
<v Speaker 1>So maybe I'll just hold my damn tongue,</v>

41
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.110
<v Speaker 1>but I'll remember that.</v>

42
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.801
<v Speaker 1>I'll remember.</v>

43
00:01:24.801 --> 00:01:26.540
<v Speaker 1>And then the third time they do it,</v>

44
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:27.440
<v Speaker 1>then you think,</v>

45
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.711
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

46
00:01:27.711 --> 00:01:28.700
<v Speaker 1>no three times.</v>

47
00:01:28.701 --> 00:01:29.481
<v Speaker 1>That's a pattern.</v>

48
00:01:29.481 --> 00:01:31.340
<v Speaker 1>And so then you can go to them and you can say,</v>

49
00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:32.174
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

50
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.093
<v Speaker 1>this happened.</v>

51
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.510
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe they did die and you say,</v>

52
00:01:35.511 --> 00:01:36.171
<v Speaker 1>well yeah,</v>

53
00:01:36.171 --> 00:01:37.100
<v Speaker 1>you can deny it,</v>

54
00:01:37.101 --> 00:01:40.280
<v Speaker 1>but then this happened and maybe they denied and you can say why you can deny</v>

55
00:01:40.281 --> 00:01:40.581
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

56
00:01:40.581 --> 00:01:42.170
<v Speaker 1>But then this happened.</v>

57
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.753
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

58
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.421
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

59
00:01:45.421 --> 00:01:50.421
<v Speaker 1>three times the charm and that's a time when you should stand up for yourself</v>

60
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.110
<v Speaker 1>and say what you have to say.</v>

61
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.830
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

62
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.310
<v Speaker 1>you have to put yourself in a position where you can say what you have to say.</v>

63
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.750
<v Speaker 1>You have to think it through,</v>

64
00:01:57.751 --> 00:01:58.890
<v Speaker 1>you have to have a plan.</v>

65
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.760
<v Speaker 1>And you can't just launch yourself off the edge of a cliff and hope that God's</v>

66
00:02:02.761 --> 00:02:04.260
<v Speaker 1>going to catch you on the way down.</v>

67
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:05.660
<v Speaker 1>And I'm saying,</v>

68
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

69
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.160
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely the case that if you have something to say,</v>

70
00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:09.630
<v Speaker 1>like if you're being oppressed at work,</v>

71
00:02:09.631 --> 00:02:10.464
<v Speaker 1>if you've got some,</v>

72
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

73
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.290
<v Speaker 1>horrible tyrant as a boss,</v>

74
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.960
<v Speaker 1>or maybe that's happening to you in your marriage,</v>

75
00:02:15.961 --> 00:02:17.370
<v Speaker 1>or maybe you're the horrible tyrant,</v>

76
00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:18.240
<v Speaker 1>God only knows.</v>

77
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:19.920
<v Speaker 1>There's things that have to be said.</v>

78
00:02:19.921 --> 00:02:21.840
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't mean you can just blurt them out.</v>

79
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.490
<v Speaker 1>You have to have a plan.</v>

80
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.290
<v Speaker 1>You have to figure out what you want to say.</v>

81
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.350
<v Speaker 1>You have to make it as minimally troublesome as possible.</v>

82
00:02:28.351 --> 00:02:31.440
<v Speaker 1>You have to have the goal that you want in mind,</v>

83
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.930
<v Speaker 1>and you have to have a backup plan like this,</v>

84
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.090
<v Speaker 1>the sort of thing that you're talking about.</v>

85
00:02:36.091 --> 00:02:39.090
<v Speaker 1>You know where you need to say something that's like a little war.</v>

86
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.880
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to walk into that unarmed and unprepared.</v>

87
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.541
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

88
00:02:42.541 --> 00:02:43.830
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean that you should,</v>

89
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.690
<v Speaker 1>that means that you should set up your life so that you're firmly enough</v>

90
00:02:48.691 --> 00:02:52.800
<v Speaker 1>anchored in a variety of different ways so that you can say what you need to say</v>

91
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.710
<v Speaker 1>without dying as a consequence.</v>

92
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:56.400
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
