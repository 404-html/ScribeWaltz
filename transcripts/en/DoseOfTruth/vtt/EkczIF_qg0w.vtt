00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.000
<v Speaker 1>Three dogs after that says,</v>

2
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:15.270
<v Speaker 1>how should a manager use the preto principle in his favorite work?</v>

3
00:00:15.271 --> 00:00:20.271
<v Speaker 1>I find myself constantly focusing on the bottom five 20% that causes 80 95% of</v>

4
00:00:21.391 --> 00:00:22.770
<v Speaker 1>the team's poor performance.</v>

5
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:23.071
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

6
00:00:23.071 --> 00:00:23.904
<v Speaker 1>that's easy.</v>

7
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.380
<v Speaker 1>The managerial literature,</v>

8
00:00:25.381 --> 00:00:29.520
<v Speaker 1>the solid managerial literature is absolutely crystal clear on this.</v>

9
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.380
<v Speaker 1>Spend all your time with your highest producers and put your lowest producers</v>

10
00:00:34.381 --> 00:00:36.420
<v Speaker 1>where they can do the least amount of damage.</v>

11
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.070
<v Speaker 1>The probability that as a manager you're going to be able to solve the problems</v>

12
00:00:41.071 --> 00:00:45.840
<v Speaker 1>of the poorest five to 20% of your work team is zero.</v>

13
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.050
<v Speaker 1>You just don't have the time or the resources at your disposal.</v>

14
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.410
<v Speaker 1>So what you should jet definitely do in order to increase performance is to</v>

15
00:00:54.901 --> 00:00:56.700
<v Speaker 1>concentrate on your top performers.</v>

16
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.560
<v Speaker 1>I know that's not what managers do.</v>

17
00:00:58.561 --> 00:01:00.060
<v Speaker 1>They do exactly what you say.</v>

18
00:01:00.061 --> 00:01:04.890
<v Speaker 1>They focus on the bottom five to 20% but that's exactly the wrong thing to do as</v>

19
00:01:04.891 --> 00:01:05.724
<v Speaker 1>a manager.</v>

20
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.290
<v Speaker 1>Focus on your best people.</v>

21
00:01:07.291 --> 00:01:09.210
<v Speaker 1>They're hyper productive as you already know.</v>

22
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.253
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

23
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.303
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

24
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

25
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.300
<v Speaker 1>maybe you need to reconceptualize the way that you're interacting with your</v>

26
00:01:15.301 --> 00:01:16.110
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

27
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.990
<v Speaker 1>but you should have regular conversations,</v>

28
00:01:18.991 --> 00:01:21.090
<v Speaker 1>at least with those that you think are outstanding.</v>

29
00:01:21.091 --> 00:01:22.350
<v Speaker 1>Let them know that you really,</v>

30
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:23.543
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

31
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.110
<v Speaker 1>what would you say that you're really happy with their performance and see what</v>

32
00:01:28.111 --> 00:01:30.480
<v Speaker 1>you can do to get obstacles the hell out of their way.</v>

33
00:01:30.481 --> 00:01:32.160
<v Speaker 1>Because as a manager,</v>

34
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.300
<v Speaker 1>essentially what you should be doing is identifying the top performers and</v>

35
00:01:36.301 --> 00:01:39.300
<v Speaker 1>they're doing everything you can to clear out the obstacles in their path.</v>

36
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.010
<v Speaker 1>That's the right way to think about it.</v>

37
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.320
<v Speaker 1>And also to give yourself enough time to develop a medium to longterm plan and</v>

38
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.650
<v Speaker 1>stop fighting fires on a day to day basis.</v>

39
00:01:48.651 --> 00:01:52.590
<v Speaker 1>You need to at least 90 minutes a week to think about where you want things to</v>

40
00:01:52.591 --> 00:01:54.450
<v Speaker 1>be going into medium to long term.</v>

41
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:55.620
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

42
00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.620
<v Speaker 1>but I can't overemphasize the importance of dealing with your top productivity.</v>

43
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.233
<v Speaker 1>You're top,</v>

44
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.200
<v Speaker 1>your highest,</v>

45
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.120
<v Speaker 1>your most productive people.</v>

46
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.560
<v Speaker 1>That's where all the gains are.</v>

47
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.760
<v Speaker 1>That's where all the games are.</v>
