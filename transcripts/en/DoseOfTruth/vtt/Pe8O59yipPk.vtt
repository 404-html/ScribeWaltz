1
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.990
<v Speaker 1>So let's say that we're going to play repeated trading games,</v>

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.240
<v Speaker 1>and if you're a very agreeable,</v>

3
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.120
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to bargain harder on my behalf,</v>

4
00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:10.800
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to bargain on your own behalf.</v>

5
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.450
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you're very disagreeable,</v>

6
00:00:12.451 --> 00:00:13.440
<v Speaker 1>you're going to do the reverse.</v>

7
00:00:13.441 --> 00:00:14.274
<v Speaker 1>You're going to think,</v>

8
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean this trading game for me and you are going to take care of your own</v>

9
00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:20.200
<v Speaker 1>interests where an agreeable person is going to say no,</v>

10
00:00:20.201 --> 00:00:20.760
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

11
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.800
<v Speaker 1>at best this is at worst,</v>

12
00:00:22.801 --> 00:00:26.190
<v Speaker 1>this has to be 50 50 but I'd like to help you every way I can.</v>

13
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:27.121
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

14
00:00:27.121 --> 00:00:27.870
<v Speaker 1>now the credit,</v>

15
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:28.141
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

16
00:00:28.141 --> 00:00:28.690
<v Speaker 1>so you Kinda,</v>

17
00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:29.670
<v Speaker 1>you kinda understand that.</v>

18
00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:33.000
<v Speaker 1>Now the advantage to being agreeable then is that you're good in teams and</v>

19
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:35.820
<v Speaker 1>you're very much likely to give other people credit that bad.</v>

20
00:00:35.821 --> 00:00:38.970
<v Speaker 1>The downside of being agreeable is that you're not very good at putting forward</v>

21
00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:39.870
<v Speaker 1>your own interests.</v>

22
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.350
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that predicts salary across time,</v>

23
00:00:43.351 --> 00:00:44.184
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

24
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.060
<v Speaker 1>is agreeableness.</v>

25
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.350
<v Speaker 1>And it predicts it negatively.</v>

26
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.320
<v Speaker 1>And so it's part of the reason why women get paid less than men.</v>

27
00:00:49.321 --> 00:00:53.850
<v Speaker 1>And this is something for the women in the class to really listen to because</v>

28
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.660
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

29
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.840
<v Speaker 1>how you get paid across time depends on a very large number of things,</v>

30
00:00:57.841 --> 00:00:58.051
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

31
00:00:58.051 --> 00:01:01.710
<v Speaker 1>It depends on your skills and your abilities and your position and your social</v>

32
00:01:01.711 --> 00:01:02.700
<v Speaker 1>network and all of that,</v>

33
00:01:02.701 --> 00:01:05.790
<v Speaker 1>but the other thing it depends on is whether or not you actually go ask for</v>

34
00:01:05.791 --> 00:01:09.990
<v Speaker 1>money or maybe that you don't even ask because actually you don't ask for money.</v>

35
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.380
<v Speaker 1>You tell people that you need to be paid more or something they don't like will</v>

36
00:01:13.381 --> 00:01:15.390
<v Speaker 1>happen and I don't mean as a threat.</v>

37
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean that you have to be willing when you're negotiating to have an</v>

38
00:01:20.071 --> 00:01:20.640
<v Speaker 1>alternative,</v>

39
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.610
<v Speaker 1>you go talk to your boss who isn't going to give you money because everyone</v>

40
00:01:23.611 --> 00:01:24.300
<v Speaker 1>wants money,</v>

41
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.510
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

42
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:25.650
<v Speaker 1>It's a competitive game.</v>

43
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:26.693
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have to be,</v>

44
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.960
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to go there and say,</v>

45
00:01:27.961 --> 00:01:28.560
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

46
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.820
<v Speaker 1>here's what I do.</v>

47
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.410
<v Speaker 1>Here's why it's useful.</v>

48
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.280
<v Speaker 1>Here's why you have to give me more money and this is by opportunities.</v>

49
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.270
<v Speaker 1>If you don't,</v>

50
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.140
<v Speaker 1>and then you're not taking your boss's money anyways because it's very seldom,</v>

51
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.320
<v Speaker 1>very frequently the case that he's working for a whopping big company,</v>

52
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.630
<v Speaker 1>but he needs an excuse to give you money because everyone's asking for money all</v>

53
00:01:48.631 --> 00:01:49.350
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

54
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.330
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to put your case forward powerfully and disagreeable.</v>

55
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.751
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

56
00:01:54.751 --> 00:01:57.510
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to do it to disagree and bleed because then he's going to think</v>

57
00:01:57.511 --> 00:01:58.350
<v Speaker 1>that you're a son of a bin.</v>

58
00:01:58.351 --> 00:01:59.880
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he's not going to give you anything,</v>

59
00:01:59.881 --> 00:02:02.310
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you'll get fired for being mouthy and all of that.</v>

60
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.980
<v Speaker 1>And that certainly happens to people who are too disagreeable.</v>

61
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.630
<v Speaker 1>You got to get the balance right,</v>

62
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.160
<v Speaker 1>but it's definitely the case.</v>

63
00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:10.680
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing that happens to women that's also worth noting,</v>

64
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.560
<v Speaker 1>and this is probably because they're higher negative emotion,</v>

65
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.310
<v Speaker 1>is they tend to underestimate their own utility in business settings,</v>

66
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.821
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

67
00:02:17.821 --> 00:02:21.930
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're trying to evaluate what you're like and you're more tilted</v>

68
00:02:21.931 --> 00:02:25.320
<v Speaker 1>towards negative emotion than the things that you do that are wrong are going to</v>

69
00:02:25.321 --> 00:02:26.220
<v Speaker 1>stand out more,</v>

70
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.920
<v Speaker 1>more on the foreground and the things that you do that are right.</v>

71
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.180
<v Speaker 1>So if you go into a negotiation and you're uncertain already because you have</v>

72
00:02:33.181 --> 00:02:36.450
<v Speaker 1>self doubts and then you're agreeable in the negotiation,</v>

73
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.080
<v Speaker 1>what's going to happen is that you're not going to win as often.</v>

74
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.190
<v Speaker 1>And winning in in a business setting or in a career development setting means</v>

75
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.940
<v Speaker 1>more opportunity for promotion and more revenue generated.</v>

76
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.410
<v Speaker 1>Now the downside of that,</v>

77
00:02:49.411 --> 00:02:49.831
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

78
00:02:49.831 --> 00:02:53.430
<v Speaker 1>is as you climb the business hierarchies that you also have to take on more</v>

79
00:02:53.431 --> 00:02:54.390
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>

80
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.780
<v Speaker 1>And that responsibility is sometimes unpleasant as well,</v>

81
00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.690
<v Speaker 1>especially to people who are agreeable because you're not necessarily liked if</v>

82
00:03:01.691 --> 00:03:05.380
<v Speaker 1>you're in a position of authority and agreeable people really like to be liked.</v>

83
00:03:05.381 --> 00:03:09.100
<v Speaker 1>It's their primary motive motivator because they're concerned about the</v>

84
00:03:09.101 --> 00:03:09.551
<v Speaker 1>maintenance,</v>

85
00:03:09.551 --> 00:03:10.031
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

86
00:03:10.031 --> 00:03:10.810
<v Speaker 1>of of,</v>

87
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:11.320
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

88
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.600
<v Speaker 1>of intimate positive relationships.</v>

89
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.700
<v Speaker 1>But that also makes them conflict avoidant.</v>

90
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.601
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

91
00:03:16.601 --> 00:03:19.030
<v Speaker 1>So now you guys can think about this,</v>

92
00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:19.864
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

93
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:20.760
<v Speaker 1>but I'll,</v>

94
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.760
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you why.</v>

95
00:03:21.761 --> 00:03:25.450
<v Speaker 1>I think the personality differences between men and women exist now,</v>

96
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.850
<v Speaker 1>these are speculative hypotheses,</v>

97
00:03:27.851 --> 00:03:30.460
<v Speaker 1>but they're reasonably well documented by,</v>

98
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.780
<v Speaker 1>by the relevant literature.</v>

99
00:03:31.781 --> 00:03:32.171
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>

100
00:03:32.171 --> 00:03:32.951
<v Speaker 1>let's think about it.</v>

101
00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:36.280
<v Speaker 1>The first thing we might think about is what's the difference between men and</v>

102
00:03:36.281 --> 00:03:36.760
<v Speaker 1>women?</v>

103
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.941
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

104
00:03:36.941 --> 00:03:37.774
<v Speaker 1>how do they differ?</v>

105
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.771
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

106
00:03:38.771 --> 00:03:42.310
<v Speaker 1>the first thing we might observe is that if you look at personality differences</v>

107
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.700
<v Speaker 1>between p pre pubescent boys and girls,</v>

108
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:46.930
<v Speaker 1>they're not very large.</v>

109
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.480
<v Speaker 1>Boys and girls don't differ in terms of their,</v>

110
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.010
<v Speaker 1>their trait neuroticism,</v>

111
00:03:51.011 --> 00:03:51.844
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

112
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.160
<v Speaker 1>What happens is that when puberty kicks in,</v>

113
00:03:54.161 --> 00:03:58.780
<v Speaker 1>women's trait neuroticism rises and it stays higher than men for the rest of</v>

114
00:03:58.781 --> 00:03:59.500
<v Speaker 1>their life.</v>

115
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.430
<v Speaker 1>And this is why you see this reflected in the different kinds of psychopathology</v>

116
00:04:03.431 --> 00:04:04.031
<v Speaker 1>that be set,</v>

117
00:04:04.031 --> 00:04:04.721
<v Speaker 1>the two sexist.</v>

118
00:04:04.721 --> 00:04:07.390
<v Speaker 1>So men are overrepresented in alcoholism,</v>

119
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.171
<v Speaker 1>drug abuse,</v>

120
00:04:08.171 --> 00:04:09.430
<v Speaker 1>antisocial personality,</v>

121
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.000
<v Speaker 1>and a host of learning disorders as well as add attention deficit disorder.</v>

122
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.870
<v Speaker 1>And women are overrepresented in depression and anxiety primarily.</v>

123
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.230
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be tightly associated with higher levels of trait neuroticism</v>

124
00:04:20.231 --> 00:04:24.130
<v Speaker 1>because maybe it's if you're at the 95th percentile or higher,</v>

125
00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:26.200
<v Speaker 1>let's say in trait neuroticism,</v>

126
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.860
<v Speaker 1>there isn't much different than difference between that and being somewhat prone</v>

127
00:04:29.861 --> 00:04:31.060
<v Speaker 1>to depression and anxiety.</v>

128
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.460
<v Speaker 1>And because the curves overlap,</v>

129
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:34.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

130
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.670
<v Speaker 1>th th th the curves aren't identical.</v>

131
00:04:36.671 --> 00:04:39.040
<v Speaker 1>The normal distributions are identical for men and women.</v>

132
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.510
<v Speaker 1>You tilt the one to the,</v>

133
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:41.081
<v Speaker 1>to the right,</v>

134
00:04:41.081 --> 00:04:42.400
<v Speaker 1>to the women's curve,</v>

135
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.740
<v Speaker 1>to the right towards higher levels of neuroticism.</v>

136
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:45.430
<v Speaker 1>You go out,</v>

137
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.630
<v Speaker 1>you look for the person in 20 who has the highest levels of negative emotion,</v>

138
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.030
<v Speaker 1>it's much more likely to be female than male.</v>

139
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.691
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

140
00:04:52.691 --> 00:04:54.250
<v Speaker 1>so let's see if we can figure out why.</v>

141
00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.050
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to tell you some things,</v>

142
00:04:56.051 --> 00:04:57.760
<v Speaker 1>basic differences between men and women.</v>

143
00:04:57.761 --> 00:04:59.800
<v Speaker 1>And you can tell me what you think about it if you are,</v>

144
00:04:59.801 --> 00:05:01.030
<v Speaker 1>if you agree or disagree.</v>

145
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.810
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

146
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.830
<v Speaker 1>First size differential emerges between men and women at puberty,</v>

147
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

148
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.790
<v Speaker 1>Because boys and girls are roughly the same size and roughly the same strength.</v>

149
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.510
<v Speaker 1>But men get bigger at puberty when the testosterone kicks in.</v>

150
00:05:13.511 --> 00:05:14.590
<v Speaker 1>And more importantly,</v>

151
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.750
<v Speaker 1>not only do they get taller and heavier,</v>

152
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.090
<v Speaker 1>but their upper body strength is much higher.</v>

153
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:24.010
<v Speaker 1>And that's a real issue for for combat because human beings punch.</v>

154
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.420
<v Speaker 1>There's other animals that do that.</v>

155
00:05:25.421 --> 00:05:26.710
<v Speaker 1>Kangaroos do that two ways.</v>

156
00:05:26.711 --> 00:05:27.520
<v Speaker 1>So we're not the,</v>

157
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.870
<v Speaker 1>we're not the only people that punch,</v>

158
00:05:28.871 --> 00:05:30.790
<v Speaker 1>but we have clubs on the ends of our arms.</v>

159
00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:31.780
<v Speaker 1>So That's interesting.</v>

160
00:05:31.781 --> 00:05:32.291
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>

161
00:05:32.291 --> 00:05:33.320
<v Speaker 1>so there's a bar,</v>

162
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.490
<v Speaker 1>there's a body size difference that's important to strength differential,</v>

163
00:05:36.491 --> 00:05:37.324
<v Speaker 1>that's important.</v>

164
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:38.830
<v Speaker 1>Next thing I think.</v>

165
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.180
<v Speaker 1>So let's assume that the reason that women are higher in sensitivity to negative</v>

166
00:05:43.181 --> 00:05:46.300
<v Speaker 1>emotion is because the world is actually more dangerous to women.</v>

167
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.470
<v Speaker 1>I think that women's nervous systems are not adapted to women.</v>

168
00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:55.840
<v Speaker 1>I think women's nervous systems are adapted to the mother infant dyad.</v>

169
00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.480
<v Speaker 1>And because you are not the same creature when you have an infant,</v>

170
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:00.440
<v Speaker 1>not at all,</v>

171
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.670
<v Speaker 1>you're way more vulnerable.</v>

172
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.780
<v Speaker 1>And it's partly because you have to express their vulnerability of the infant</v>

173
00:06:05.781 --> 00:06:07.340
<v Speaker 1>and you also have to care for it.</v>

174
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:08.031
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

175
00:06:08.031 --> 00:06:09.860
<v Speaker 1>So you think about an infant,</v>

176
00:06:09.861 --> 00:06:11.360
<v Speaker 1>especially under nine months.</v>

177
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.313
<v Speaker 1>So let's say,</v>

178
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.220
<v Speaker 1>how are you going to be wired up if you're going to optimally care for an infant</v>

179
00:06:16.221 --> 00:06:17.060
<v Speaker 1>under nine months?</v>

180
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.380
<v Speaker 1>And I'm saying under nine months,</v>

181
00:06:18.381 --> 00:06:22.370
<v Speaker 1>because women generally do the bulk of childcare for infants who are under nine</v>

182
00:06:22.371 --> 00:06:23.060
<v Speaker 1>months old.</v>

183
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.230
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason for that,</v>

184
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:25.730
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole host of reasons,</v>

185
00:06:25.731 --> 00:06:28.340
<v Speaker 1>but part of the reasons for that obviously is that they breastfeed.</v>

186
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:32.210
<v Speaker 1>But imagine what you need to be wired up biologically in order to care for an</v>

187
00:06:32.211 --> 00:06:32.690
<v Speaker 1>infant.</v>

188
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:33.523
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

189
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:35.450
<v Speaker 1>they're very demanding,</v>

190
00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

191
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:41.030
<v Speaker 1>Because they're completely helpless and they're demanding 24 hours a day and</v>

192
00:06:41.031 --> 00:06:41.864
<v Speaker 1>it's quite,</v>

193
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:43.010
<v Speaker 1>it's quite,</v>

194
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

195
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:44.061
<v Speaker 1>it's quite,</v>

196
00:06:44.061 --> 00:06:44.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

197
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:45.440
<v Speaker 1>emotional load.</v>

198
00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:48.140
<v Speaker 1>And an infant under nine months is never wrong,</v>

199
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:49.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

200
00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:52.400
<v Speaker 1>What you do to an infant under nine months is when they're in distress,</v>

201
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:53.960
<v Speaker 1>you always respond.</v>

202
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:55.970
<v Speaker 1>You never tell the infant,</v>

203
00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.430
<v Speaker 1>get your act together and stop whining,</v>

204
00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:58.880
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

205
00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:59.780
<v Speaker 1>Which you can do,</v>

206
00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:00.590
<v Speaker 1>say to an end,</v>

207
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.180
<v Speaker 1>to a child that's 18 months old,</v>

208
00:07:02.181 --> 00:07:04.190
<v Speaker 1>you can start having that sort of conversation,</v>

209
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.610
<v Speaker 1>but under nine months it's like nothing is the infant's fault.</v>

210
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.300
<v Speaker 1>It's surrounded in an extraordinarily threatening world.</v>

211
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:15.230
<v Speaker 1>And you have to be responsive to what it needs regardless of what you want.</v>

212
00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.960
<v Speaker 1>And you have to be very sensitive to the threats that emerged in the</v>

213
00:07:17.961 --> 00:07:18.794
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>

214
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:23.090
<v Speaker 1>And so I think the price that women pay for that ability to have an intimate</v>

215
00:07:23.091 --> 00:07:27.110
<v Speaker 1>relationship with infants in the very earliest stages of development is that</v>

216
00:07:27.111 --> 00:07:31.370
<v Speaker 1>their nervous systems are actually wired so that they can perform that role</v>

217
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.353
<v Speaker 1>optimally.</v>

218
00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:36.470
<v Speaker 1>And the disadvantage to that is that having a temperament like that doesn't work</v>

219
00:07:36.471 --> 00:07:39.080
<v Speaker 1>that well when you're dealing with adult men,</v>

220
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:42.260
<v Speaker 1>especially when you're dealing with them and in a business environment because</v>

221
00:07:42.261 --> 00:07:43.640
<v Speaker 1>it's not the same thing.</v>

222
00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:44.541
<v Speaker 1>Not at all.</v>

223
00:07:44.541 --> 00:07:45.770
<v Speaker 1>It's a competitive environment.</v>

224
00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:46.401
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

225
00:07:46.401 --> 00:07:46.641
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

226
00:07:46.641 --> 00:07:48.920
<v Speaker 1>so agreeable people are compassionate and polite.</v>

227
00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:50.720
<v Speaker 1>What are disagreeable people like?</v>

228
00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:52.550
<v Speaker 1>They're tough minded.</v>

229
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:53.563
<v Speaker 1>They're blunt,</v>

230
00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:54.650
<v Speaker 1>they're competitive,</v>

231
00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:56.960
<v Speaker 1>and they won't do a damn thing they don't want to do.</v>

232
00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:59.240
<v Speaker 1>So it isn't exactly that they're aggressive,</v>

233
00:07:59.241 --> 00:08:02.420
<v Speaker 1>although they will push you the hell out of their way if you're in the way.</v>

234
00:08:02.421 --> 00:08:03.110
<v Speaker 1>They're not.</v>

235
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:05.870
<v Speaker 1>They're not like volatile like you are.</v>

236
00:08:05.871 --> 00:08:07.700
<v Speaker 1>If you're high in neuroticism,</v>

237
00:08:07.701 --> 00:08:09.050
<v Speaker 1>it isn't defensive aggression.</v>

238
00:08:09.051 --> 00:08:10.670
<v Speaker 1>It's more like predatory aggression.</v>

239
00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:12.470
<v Speaker 1>It's dominance behavior.</v>

240
00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:14.180
<v Speaker 1>And so for someone who's high,</v>

241
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:15.103
<v Speaker 1>who's high,</v>

242
00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:16.460
<v Speaker 1>highly disagreeable,</v>

243
00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:20.780
<v Speaker 1>they look at the world as a place in which they can compete and win.</v>

244
00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:22.400
<v Speaker 1>And I'll tell you a story,</v>

245
00:08:22.401 --> 00:08:23.234
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend,</v>

246
00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.480
<v Speaker 1>I gave him my personality test,</v>

247
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:29.450
<v Speaker 1>the Big Five aspects scale that Colin de Young developed tongue in my lab.</v>

248
00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:30.673
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

249
00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.360
<v Speaker 1>I knew he is a disagreeable guy and by interacting with them,</v>

250
00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:39.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's even rude to people sort of spontaneously on the street.</v>

251
00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.340
<v Speaker 1>I actually liked them quite a bit.</v>

252
00:08:40.341 --> 00:08:40.641
<v Speaker 1>He's very,</v>

253
00:08:40.641 --> 00:08:41.181
<v Speaker 1>very funny.</v>

254
00:08:41.181 --> 00:08:43.140
<v Speaker 1>He's also very conscientious so you can trust them,</v>

255
00:08:43.141 --> 00:08:44.870
<v Speaker 1>but it's disagreeable as hell.</v>

256
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.273
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

257
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:49.460
<v Speaker 1>so I gave him this task because I thought it would be funny and he came out as</v>

258
00:08:49.461 --> 00:08:54.461
<v Speaker 1>the most disagreeable person in 10,000 so reasonably reasonable in compassion,</v>

259
00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:00.810
<v Speaker 1>both 30th percentile but like 0.001 in politeness.</v>

260
00:09:00.811 --> 00:09:04.200
<v Speaker 1>So he's extraordinarily blunt and he'll just say absolutely anything,</v>

261
00:09:04.201 --> 00:09:05.700
<v Speaker 1>no matter how horrible it is.</v>

262
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:09.330
<v Speaker 1>And he was often brought into corporations to sort of clean them up.</v>

263
00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:12.090
<v Speaker 1>So if a corporation was tilting and not doing well,</v>

264
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:15.570
<v Speaker 1>they bring him in to find out how the useless people were in fire them.</v>

265
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:19.950
<v Speaker 1>And I talked to him about that because I've had the miss opportunity to have to</v>

266
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:21.900
<v Speaker 1>not have graduate students in my lab,</v>

267
00:09:21.901 --> 00:09:22.411
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

268
00:09:22.411 --> 00:09:23.340
<v Speaker 1>that weren't performing well.</v>

269
00:09:23.341 --> 00:09:24.061
<v Speaker 1>And I'd find it very,</v>

270
00:09:24.061 --> 00:09:24.990
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to,</v>

271
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:25.561
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

272
00:09:25.561 --> 00:09:27.990
<v Speaker 1>dress someone down and certainly difficult to fire them.</v>

273
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:30.360
<v Speaker 1>I just hate it because I'm actually quite an agreeable person,</v>

274
00:09:30.361 --> 00:09:31.320
<v Speaker 1>much to my chagrin.</v>

275
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:33.660
<v Speaker 1>And I asked him about that and I said,</v>

276
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:33.811
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

277
00:09:33.811 --> 00:09:34.620
<v Speaker 1>what do you do?</v>

278
00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.180
<v Speaker 1>You have to fire people all the time.</v>

279
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:37.140
<v Speaker 1>How do you handle out?</v>

280
00:09:37.141 --> 00:09:37.411
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

281
00:09:37.411 --> 00:09:38.130
<v Speaker 1>handle it.</v>

282
00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:39.210
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy it.</v>

283
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:40.523
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

284
00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:40.951
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

285
00:09:40.951 --> 00:09:43.200
<v Speaker 1>that's so interesting that someone would have that response.</v>

286
00:09:43.201 --> 00:09:43.501
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

287
00:09:43.501 --> 00:09:43.591
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

288
00:09:43.591 --> 00:09:44.790
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean you enjoy it?</v>

289
00:09:44.791 --> 00:09:45.031
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

290
00:09:45.031 --> 00:09:45.331
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

291
00:09:45.331 --> 00:09:49.710
<v Speaker 1>I go into these companies and I analyze the performance of groups of people,</v>

292
00:09:49.711 --> 00:09:49.991
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

293
00:09:49.991 --> 00:09:51.180
<v Speaker 1>And there's in those groups,</v>

294
00:09:51.181 --> 00:09:52.560
<v Speaker 1>there are people who are really striving,</v>

295
00:09:52.561 --> 00:09:56.550
<v Speaker 1>really trying hard and working themselves really hard and being productive.</v>

296
00:09:56.551 --> 00:09:59.070
<v Speaker 1>And then there's these people that are just doing nothing.</v>

297
00:09:59.071 --> 00:10:00.000
<v Speaker 1>They're completely in the way.</v>

298
00:10:00.001 --> 00:10:01.380
<v Speaker 1>They don't carry their weight at all.</v>

299
00:10:01.381 --> 00:10:03.360
<v Speaker 1>They take advantage every chance they get.</v>

300
00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.610
<v Speaker 1>And they're always whining about why they can't work.</v>

301
00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:08.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like I find out who they are and call them into my office and I tell them</v>

302
00:10:08.941 --> 00:10:10.200
<v Speaker 1>exactly what they've been doing.</v>

303
00:10:10.201 --> 00:10:11.610
<v Speaker 1>It's like hit the road buddy.</v>

304
00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:12.480
<v Speaker 1>You've had your,</v>

305
00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.710
<v Speaker 1>you've had your run of it.</v>

306
00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:14.873
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

307
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:15.630
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

308
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:16.110
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

309
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:16.943
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>

310
00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:17.221
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

311
00:10:17.221 --> 00:10:17.611
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

312
00:10:17.611 --> 00:10:18.450
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you,</v>

313
00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:18.721
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

314
00:10:18.721 --> 00:10:22.890
<v Speaker 1>I've had situations in my lab where I had underperforming graduate students and</v>

315
00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.520
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that was really awful about that was that it was really hard</v>

316
00:10:26.521 --> 00:10:28.440
<v Speaker 1>on the high performing graduate students,</v>

317
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:29.071
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

318
00:10:29.071 --> 00:10:33.480
<v Speaker 1>because they felt that even being in the same category as the people who weren't</v>

319
00:10:33.481 --> 00:10:36.870
<v Speaker 1>working hard and pulling their weight devalued what they were doing.</v>

320
00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:37.561
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

321
00:10:37.561 --> 00:10:38.730
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly right.</v>

322
00:10:38.731 --> 00:10:40.130
<v Speaker 1>And so this is also why there's,</v>

323
00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.880
<v Speaker 1>there is a conscientiousness trait and it agreeableness trait because</v>

324
00:10:44.881 --> 00:10:47.910
<v Speaker 1>conscientious people judge you on your accomplishments,</v>

325
00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:48.510
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

326
00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:50.220
<v Speaker 1>They don't give a damn about your feelings,</v>

327
00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:50.910
<v Speaker 1>not a bit.</v>

328
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:51.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

329
00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:53.100
<v Speaker 1>are you doing the work or not?</v>

330
00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:54.540
<v Speaker 1>Whereas agreeable people think,</v>

331
00:10:54.541 --> 00:10:54.781
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

332
00:10:54.781 --> 00:10:55.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

333
00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:57.090
<v Speaker 1>your mother is sick and you know you've,</v>

334
00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:01.440
<v Speaker 1>you've got a bunch of family problems and we all have to take care of each other</v>

335
00:11:01.441 --> 00:11:03.250
<v Speaker 1>and it's no wonder that you're having a rough time.</v>

336
00:11:03.251 --> 00:11:06.990
<v Speaker 1>And like you can't say that one of those attitudes is correct and the other</v>

337
00:11:06.991 --> 00:11:07.824
<v Speaker 1>isn't correct.</v>

338
00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:08.970
<v Speaker 1>You can't say that.</v>

339
00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:12.630
<v Speaker 1>There wouldn't be those two dimensions if there wasn't something correct about</v>

340
00:11:12.631 --> 00:11:13.410
<v Speaker 1>both of them.</v>

341
00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:16.380
<v Speaker 1>But you can certainly point out that often they conflict,</v>

342
00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:16.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

343
00:11:16.981 --> 00:11:18.240
<v Speaker 1>and so the demand for,</v>

344
00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:23.010
<v Speaker 1>for inclusiveness and unity and care and the demand for high level performance</v>

345
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.510
<v Speaker 1>in a hierarchical structure,</v>

346
00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.030
<v Speaker 1>they're very different orientations in the world.</v>

347
00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:32.010
<v Speaker 1>And so it's complicated for people who are agreeable and conscientious.</v>

348
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:37.260
<v Speaker 1>And actually I think often that large corporations and large,</v>

349
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:42.590
<v Speaker 1>large institutions of any sort run on the unheralded labor of people who are</v>

350
00:11:43.321 --> 00:11:45.950
<v Speaker 1>high in agreeableness and high in conscientiousness and they're</v>

351
00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:49.350
<v Speaker 1>disproportionately women in my experience in large institutions,</v>

352
00:11:49.351 --> 00:11:53.790
<v Speaker 1>has been that if you want to hire someone to exploit appropriately,</v>

353
00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:54.931
<v Speaker 1>not appropriately,</v>

354
00:11:54.931 --> 00:11:57.840
<v Speaker 1>if you wanted to hire someone to exploit productively,</v>

355
00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.680
<v Speaker 1>you higher middle aged women who are hyper conscientious and who are agreeable</v>

356
00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:03.630
<v Speaker 1>because they'll do everything.</v>

357
00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:05.790
<v Speaker 1>They won't take credit for it and they won't complain.</v>
