00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.480
<v Speaker 1>To tap into the dopaminergic system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said you needed to value goal.</v>

2
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.660
<v Speaker 1>Is there any way to tap into the opioid</v>
<v Speaker 1>system?</v>

3
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.800
<v Speaker 1>I want to be more connected to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but part of me can't get myself to care.</v>

4
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.151
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5
00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:21.000
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe you're a little bit on the</v>

6
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:22.980
<v Speaker 1>disagreeable side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a possibility.</v>

7
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.540
<v Speaker 1>There's some interesting clinical</v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence that suggests that one of the</v>

8
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.800
<v Speaker 1>things that disagreeable people can do</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to facilitate their</v>

9
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.890
<v Speaker 1>interactions with other people is to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>people favors.</v>

10
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.220
<v Speaker 1>And so what you might say is that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could start by acting like you care and</v>

11
00:00:40.321 --> 00:00:43.440
<v Speaker 1>then maybe you could learn how to care</v>
<v Speaker 1>through doing that.</v>

12
00:00:43.441 --> 00:00:44.730
<v Speaker 1>So maybe you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

13
00:00:44.731 --> 00:00:48.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do something nice for</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone once every two days for a month</v>

14
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.660
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and think about it a little bit and see</v>

15
00:00:51.661 --> 00:00:53.130
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see if that changes you.</v>

16
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.000
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you think yourself into change</v>

17
00:00:57.001 --> 00:01:00.210
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes you act yourself into</v>
<v Speaker 1>changing your thoughts.</v>

18
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.510
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what I would start by</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

19
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

20
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.060
<v Speaker 1>you could also be more connected to</v>
<v Speaker 1>people regardless of whether you care,</v>

21
00:01:11.161 --> 00:01:13.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say that it would take you six</v>

22
00:01:13.111 --> 00:01:17.190
<v Speaker 1>months of practice or even a year of</v>
<v Speaker 1>practice before you care.</v>

23
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.070
<v Speaker 1>But that's not so long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're young.</v>

24
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.570
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I say about that.</v>
