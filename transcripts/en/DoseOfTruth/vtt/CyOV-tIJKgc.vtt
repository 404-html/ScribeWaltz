1
00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:09.783
<v Speaker 1>At</v>

2
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.340
<v Speaker 1>Ucla on telling you a story</v>

3
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.350
<v Speaker 1>because it's pretty damn easy.</v>

4
00:00:15.351 --> 00:00:18.010
<v Speaker 1>So there's this neurological condition</v>

5
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.530
<v Speaker 1>virtually comprehensible.</v>

6
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.540
<v Speaker 1>What happens if you have any,</v>

7
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.730
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

8
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.190
<v Speaker 1>you have a stroke in the right.</v>

9
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:28.780
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

10
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.870
<v Speaker 1>the right priority area of your right hemisphere has,</v>

11
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.430
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't happen.</v>

12
00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.470
<v Speaker 1>What happens if you have that stroke is you lose the lending side and the loss</v>

13
00:00:42.431 --> 00:00:43.610
<v Speaker 1>is extremely interesting.</v>

14
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.250
<v Speaker 1>Firstly,</v>

15
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.620
<v Speaker 1>it gives you lose motor control so you can't move.</v>

16
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.970
<v Speaker 1>But that's really the beginning of it.</v>

17
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.200
<v Speaker 1>You lose your ability to conceptualize the fact that you had a left side of your</v>

18
00:00:54.201 --> 00:00:55.900
<v Speaker 1>body and more.</v>

19
00:00:55.901 --> 00:01:00.550
<v Speaker 1>You lose the ability to conceive and we don't know how this happens.</v>

20
00:01:00.551 --> 00:01:05.551
<v Speaker 1>I think it must be something like if I stand here and look out at all of me,</v>

21
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.400
<v Speaker 1>I can see that people right in front of me quite clearly.</v>

22
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.890
<v Speaker 1>And then the people to my right and left tomes,</v>

23
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.960
<v Speaker 1>I keep my eyes big savings right in front of me.</v>

24
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.130
<v Speaker 1>They're quite blurry.</v>

25
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.780
<v Speaker 1>I can't see their faces on the way,</v>

26
00:01:16.781 --> 00:01:17.531
<v Speaker 1>no other people.</v>

27
00:01:17.531 --> 00:01:21.360
<v Speaker 1>And then by this are out at the periphery of my visual system.</v>

28
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't even have color vision anymore.</v>

29
00:01:23.171 --> 00:01:28.171
<v Speaker 1>Even white tape it for the test showed that and then past that,</v>

30
00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:29.980
<v Speaker 1>which is behind me.</v>

31
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.993
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing,</v>

32
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.800
<v Speaker 1>it's not black.</v>

33
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:33.970
<v Speaker 1>It's not an amputee,</v>

34
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.160
<v Speaker 1>it's just not there.</v>

35
00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.023
<v Speaker 1>It's not even,</v>

36
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.380
<v Speaker 1>it's not even not fair.</v>

37
00:01:38.381 --> 00:01:39.580
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't exist.</v>

38
00:01:39.581 --> 00:01:44.020
<v Speaker 1>And what seems to happen with people who have neglect that moves around the</v>

39
00:01:44.021 --> 00:01:46.390
<v Speaker 1>three corners of everything instead of half.</v>

40
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.210
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a gap because we really don't know.</v>

41
00:01:49.211 --> 00:01:52.120
<v Speaker 1>But if you get people who like to draw a claw,</v>

42
00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.970
<v Speaker 1>they'll put all the numbers in one half and if can give you a plate full of</v>

43
00:01:54.971 --> 00:01:55.241
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>

44
00:01:55.241 --> 00:01:57.910
<v Speaker 1>they'll only eat the food on the right side of the plate.</v>

45
00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.240
<v Speaker 1>And then if you turn the brake bill,</v>

46
00:01:59.241 --> 00:02:03.130
<v Speaker 1>he half of what's left and then even more strangely now,</v>

47
00:02:03.131 --> 00:02:07.480
<v Speaker 1>and then they notice that they have a left heart and it really upsets them.</v>

48
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:08.343
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

49
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.890
<v Speaker 1>and they noticed they have a left arm and they'll try to,</v>

50
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.430
<v Speaker 1>they'll be horrified by it.</v>

51
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.080
<v Speaker 1>They'll think in someone else's.</v>

52
00:02:14.081 --> 00:02:16.320
<v Speaker 1>They'll think extremely someone that they know or that we did.</v>

53
00:02:16.321 --> 00:02:20.840
<v Speaker 1>The nurses left the body and sometimes they'll even try to throw it out of bed</v>

54
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.940
<v Speaker 1>and so and so they don't seem to buy.</v>

55
00:02:24.941 --> 00:02:26.060
<v Speaker 1>And here's the other thing,</v>

56
00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.590
<v Speaker 1>strange strangers,</v>

57
00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.050
<v Speaker 1>they're not upset about the fact that they're half paralyzed.</v>

58
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.370
<v Speaker 1>It's because they actually don't know that they're half parallax and the reason</v>

59
00:02:33.371 --> 00:02:36.760
<v Speaker 1>for that specific part of the brain that would alert them to the fact that</v>

60
00:02:36.761 --> 00:02:39.010
<v Speaker 1>they're half paralyzed as being destroyed by the stroke.</v>

61
00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:40.690
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

62
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.590
<v Speaker 1>it's they're not have sex at all white.</v>

63
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.090
<v Speaker 1>The apartment would make them upset because you should be upset if you lose half</v>

64
00:02:46.091 --> 00:02:46.924
<v Speaker 1>your body.</v>

65
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.490
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's very upsetting.</v>

66
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.550
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that you get upset is your emergency to the importance of the loss.</v>

67
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.640
<v Speaker 1>And so imagine you can carry me a little bit.</v>

68
00:02:57.641 --> 00:02:59.570
<v Speaker 1>Well then would you notice and answer as well?</v>

69
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:00.670
<v Speaker 1>We not.</v>

70
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.120
<v Speaker 1>And so what grandma Sean was experimented with the balance,</v>

71
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.150
<v Speaker 1>literally the balance of people who have neglected.</v>

72
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.220
<v Speaker 1>He did this weird little experiment that you do to test people's vestibular</v>

73
00:03:15.221 --> 00:03:15.641
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

74
00:03:15.641 --> 00:03:18.400
<v Speaker 1>which enables them to stay on felons consultant.</v>

75
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.310
<v Speaker 1>If you pour cold water in someone's ear,</v>

76
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.390
<v Speaker 1>then it upstairs have sense of their balance because your ears are intensely</v>

77
00:03:25.391 --> 00:03:28.550
<v Speaker 1>involved in your balance and your eyes are moving back and forth and it</v>

78
00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:29.810
<v Speaker 1>destabilizes the seas.</v>

79
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.310
<v Speaker 1>And so around the Shaundra was testing his neglect patients for their,</v>

80
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.010
<v Speaker 1>for their,</v>

81
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.843
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

82
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.470
<v Speaker 1>their particular function using cold water.</v>

83
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.870
<v Speaker 1>A number of them woke up and realized that they were paralyzed.</v>

84
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.770
<v Speaker 1>And his idea was essentially that the shock,</v>

85
00:03:47.771 --> 00:03:51.250
<v Speaker 1>eventually the shock of the cold water was enough to,</v>

86
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.170
<v Speaker 1>to increase,</v>

87
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:53.471
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

88
00:03:53.471 --> 00:03:57.700
<v Speaker 1>emotional functioning enough to reactivate the damage efforts in the right</v>

89
00:03:57.701 --> 00:04:01.310
<v Speaker 1>hemisphere to wake them up enough to notice that half you're going,</v>

90
00:04:01.311 --> 00:04:01.990
<v Speaker 1>he was missing.</v>

91
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.231
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

92
00:04:02.231 --> 00:04:07.180
<v Speaker 1>Produce a catastrophic people show response when people realize what had</v>

93
00:04:07.181 --> 00:04:08.014
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

94
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.003
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

95
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.370
<v Speaker 1>so if you call the attention of someone with neglect,</v>

96
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.990
<v Speaker 1>the left him say you have a left hand there and say,</v>

97
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.691
<v Speaker 1>can you move it?</v>

98
00:04:16.691 --> 00:04:17.111
<v Speaker 1>And he'll say,</v>

99
00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:17.291
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

100
00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:18.124
<v Speaker 1>never mind.</v>

101
00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel like it hurt my arthritis is for you this morning.</v>

102
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.000
<v Speaker 1>It hurts me to come up with some rationalization for why they can't move it,</v>

103
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.650
<v Speaker 1>but they're upset.</v>

104
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.070
<v Speaker 1>So Robuchon none with irrigating for years and then they wake up and they have a</v>

105
00:04:30.071 --> 00:04:34.180
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic emotional response to the loss of the live side of your body.</v>

106
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.140
<v Speaker 1>But then 20 minutes later they snap out of it and then they forget they lost the</v>

107
00:04:38.141 --> 00:04:38.760
<v Speaker 1>left side.</v>

108
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.350
<v Speaker 1>They go right back to their old way of thinking.</v>

109
00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.100
<v Speaker 1>And what's so interesting about this and how it's related to whatever he told</v>

110
00:04:45.101 --> 00:04:49.210
<v Speaker 1>you is that sees their left hemisphere had already built a board with their body</v>

111
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.620
<v Speaker 1>and you know you haven't more than with your boy.</v>

112
00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.750
<v Speaker 1>It's really BPL walk when you,</v>

113
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.530
<v Speaker 1>you can tell that magic if you break a tooth,</v>

114
00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.080
<v Speaker 1>what happens if you break your tooth?</v>

115
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.580
<v Speaker 1>It's your tongue goes absolutely insane,</v>

116
00:05:00.581 --> 00:05:00.851
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

117
00:05:00.851 --> 00:05:01.930
<v Speaker 1>Your next three months,</v>

118
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.450
<v Speaker 1>all your tongue is poke round in there.</v>

119
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.330
<v Speaker 1>Figure out exactly the contours of your problem and maybe it takes you three</v>

120
00:05:10.331 --> 00:05:11.790
<v Speaker 1>months to update that too.</v>

121
00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.320
<v Speaker 1>You don't feel like your bones is a stranger.</v>

122
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.880
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is,</v>

123
00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:21.020
<v Speaker 1>well you should let him know which in your outright like clearing your mom just</v>

124
00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.450
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably wide are not insensitive.</v>

125
00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:24.580
<v Speaker 1>And so because why?</v>

126
00:05:24.581 --> 00:05:29.581
<v Speaker 1>You put things in there and you have to eat and so you have the intelligence of</v>

127
00:05:29.651 --> 00:05:31.030
<v Speaker 1>what's you and what isn't for you.</v>

128
00:05:31.031 --> 00:05:32.230
<v Speaker 1>Choose your town like,</v>

129
00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:35.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's very important to have that map that you see.</v>

130
00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.130
<v Speaker 1>You see with your experience with having a damage tooth,</v>

131
00:05:39.131 --> 00:05:42.850
<v Speaker 1>you see just how much work it takes to even do a little tiny bit of remapping,</v>

132
00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:43.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

133
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like three months of of Tom,</v>

134
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.610
<v Speaker 1>the effort to update your will over your mouth.</v>

135
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.880
<v Speaker 1>Imagine how much effort it would be lucky we'll take to update your model of</v>

136
00:05:51.881 --> 00:05:53.590
<v Speaker 1>your body if you've lost half of it.</v>

137
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:54.641
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

138
00:05:54.641 --> 00:05:55.181
<v Speaker 1>So that's it.</v>

139
00:05:55.181 --> 00:06:00.181
<v Speaker 1>So your left hemisphere count do that keeps on process in your body with the old</v>

140
00:06:00.591 --> 00:06:03.530
<v Speaker 1>model and since the right hemispheres damaged,</v>

141
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.410
<v Speaker 1>there isn't any emotions associated with the loss.</v>

142
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.440
<v Speaker 1>And so the left hemisphere just keeps on grinding away on its own logo on.</v>

143
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.590
<v Speaker 1>And that happens to us and walk like that's sort of how we think is that we have</v>

144
00:06:15.591 --> 00:06:20.591
<v Speaker 1>these partial models of reality more or less work and were really stubborn about</v>

145
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.690
<v Speaker 1>and we don't want them to disappear because they take a bloody modern work to</v>

146
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:26.240
<v Speaker 1>formulate.</v>

147
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.360
<v Speaker 1>And if we're forced to lose the mega trends to be catastrophic.</v>

148
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.550
<v Speaker 1>And so an example of that might be,</v>

149
00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:32.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

150
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.050
<v Speaker 1>let's say you put a whole bunch of effort into up monogamous,</v>

151
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

152
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.060
<v Speaker 1>monogamous relationship.</v>

153
00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.760
<v Speaker 1>And so actually it's lasted 10 years.</v>

154
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.340
<v Speaker 1>What's the African?</v>

155
00:06:42.341 --> 00:06:42.611
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

156
00:06:42.611 --> 00:06:43.650
<v Speaker 1>well the first PBS,</v>

157
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.920
<v Speaker 1>you've gone a lot of places with this person and that model claims with them.</v>

158
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.960
<v Speaker 1>You have a story and the story's based on your understanding of that person and</v>

159
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:57.140
<v Speaker 1>the implication of that understanding for your understanding of you.</v>

160
00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.020
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

161
00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:58.620
<v Speaker 1>you might be,</v>

162
00:06:58.620 --> 00:06:59.840
<v Speaker 1>well I took my,</v>

163
00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:05.130
<v Speaker 1>my wife or husband to Hawaii and we had a nice time at God.</v>

164
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:08.810
<v Speaker 1>You have that whole memory and you have hundreds of memories like that.</v>

165
00:07:08.811 --> 00:07:13.520
<v Speaker 1>All secrets to national story about who you are and where you are in the past.</v>

166
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:18.410
<v Speaker 1>And then you have a story like that about the present who you are now and then</v>

167
00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.090
<v Speaker 1>give a story like that about your future.</v>

168
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.080
<v Speaker 1>And then you find out that your partner's been having sequential affairs for the</v>

169
00:07:24.081 --> 00:07:26.360
<v Speaker 1>last 15 years and it's like,</v>

170
00:07:26.361 --> 00:07:30.350
<v Speaker 1>well what happens all your models now in development?</v>

171
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:32.001
<v Speaker 1>And then you think,</v>

172
00:07:32.001 --> 00:07:33.410
<v Speaker 1>well what does that mean exactly?</v>

173
00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:34.191
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

174
00:07:34.191 --> 00:07:38.270
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't just mean that you don't know who your partner is,</v>

175
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:43.550
<v Speaker 1>although we greeted means that it also means everything you thought about your</v>

176
00:07:43.551 --> 00:07:44.810
<v Speaker 1>past isn't wrong.</v>

177
00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:46.700
<v Speaker 1>All those memories of,</v>

178
00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:47.960
<v Speaker 1>of everything that happened,</v>

179
00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.180
<v Speaker 1>those aren't accurate.</v>

180
00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:53.540
<v Speaker 1>And so when something like that happens in DC trail,</v>

181
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.900
<v Speaker 1>this is why Dante betrayers in the lowest level of hell,</v>

182
00:07:56.901 --> 00:07:57.734
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

183
00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:00.450
<v Speaker 1>besides safety itself and chase Deniece,</v>

184
00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:05.470
<v Speaker 1>this is the betrayers because it blows out your model up in the past and the</v>

185
00:08:05.541 --> 00:08:06.590
<v Speaker 1>presence of the future.</v>

186
00:08:06.591 --> 00:08:08.660
<v Speaker 1>You told me about where your are,</v>

187
00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:11.900
<v Speaker 1>we don't know where you were and you don't know where you're going.</v>

188
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:16.460
<v Speaker 1>And it's worse than that because you also don't know who you are anymore because</v>

189
00:08:16.461 --> 00:08:21.461
<v Speaker 1>you are obviously someone who just wasn't that awake and you were with Justin</v>

190
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.480
<v Speaker 1>wasn't who you thought they work.</v>

191
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:30.040
<v Speaker 1>And so it's no wonder you'd be resistant to information like that.</v>

192
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.221
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

193
00:08:31.221 --> 00:08:32.080
<v Speaker 1>It's like who think out.</v>

194
00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:36.880
<v Speaker 1>Once they have a global theory of that magnitude disprove that globe,</v>

195
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:40.400
<v Speaker 1>it just leaves you wide open and exposed to the world.</v>

196
00:08:40.401 --> 00:08:41.330
<v Speaker 1>So we heard your tech,</v>

197
00:08:41.331 --> 00:08:41.840
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

198
00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.060
<v Speaker 1>your theory is as much as you possibly can,</v>

199
00:08:44.061 --> 00:08:48.290
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to overthrow them because of some housing will disapprove pretty</v>

200
00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:49.343
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

201
00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:49.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

202
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:52.790
<v Speaker 1>psychologists talk about that as confirmation bias.</v>

203
00:08:52.791 --> 00:08:53.271
<v Speaker 1>Like Sam,</v>

204
00:08:53.271 --> 00:08:56.730
<v Speaker 1>think about it as a cognitive that they no be moaning.</v>

205
00:08:56.731 --> 00:08:59.940
<v Speaker 1>The fact that people are very stubborn about giving up their presuppositions,</v>

206
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:01.430
<v Speaker 1>but it's so bloody one little,</v>

207
00:09:01.431 --> 00:09:01.711
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

208
00:09:01.711 --> 00:09:02.250
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

209
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:03.083
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

210
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.880
<v Speaker 1>you put a lot of effort into that formulation of the world.</v>

211
00:09:05.881 --> 00:09:07.920
<v Speaker 1>It's not just a representation,</v>

212
00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:08.670
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

213
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:11.010
<v Speaker 1>It's the way you live in the world.</v>

214
00:09:11.011 --> 00:09:14.130
<v Speaker 1>And so when you give that up and then what the hell are you supposed to do?</v>

215
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:14.851
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

216
00:09:14.851 --> 00:09:16.200
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to be enraged.</v>

217
00:09:16.201 --> 00:09:18.550
<v Speaker 1>He supposed to have a 50 supposed to become herbivorous.</v>

218
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:20.930
<v Speaker 1>Are you supposed to collapse into depression?</v>

219
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:23.370
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to be like infinitely cynical.</v>

220
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:26.610
<v Speaker 1>Are you supposed to never have a relationship in your life?</v>

221
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:30.120
<v Speaker 1>Are you supposed to have complete contempt for yourself for being seen nine even</v>

222
00:09:30.121 --> 00:09:30.954
<v Speaker 1>blind,</v>

223
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.290
<v Speaker 1>or you're supposed to hate you mad at him because it contains the capacity for</v>

224
00:09:34.291 --> 00:09:35.670
<v Speaker 1>that kind of betrayal.</v>

225
00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:37.200
<v Speaker 1>It's like you don't know.</v>

226
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:40.560
<v Speaker 1>All of those things are true all at one civil paisley,</v>

227
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:43.110
<v Speaker 1>and that's the little space that you occupy,</v>

228
00:09:43.111 --> 00:09:43.860
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

229
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:46.020
<v Speaker 1>That's the mythical underworld essentially.</v>

230
00:09:46.021 --> 00:09:49.500
<v Speaker 1>That's a place you go when your dreams and hopes die.</v>

231
00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.690
<v Speaker 1>Everyone goes there from time to time.</v>

232
00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:54.180
<v Speaker 1>Lots of people go there and never come out.</v>
