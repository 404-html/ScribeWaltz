00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.400
<v Speaker 1>Hello Dr Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I've been listening back to all of</v>

2
00:00:13.401 --> 00:00:16.460
<v Speaker 1>these biblical lectures for the second</v>
<v Speaker 1>time now and um,</v>

3
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.730
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to show you an observation I</v>
<v Speaker 1>came upon because I was trying to find a</v>

4
00:00:19.731 --> 00:00:21.710
<v Speaker 1>question that you haven't been asked</v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

5
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.620
<v Speaker 1>which is harder than doing my ryerson</v>
<v Speaker 1>exams,</v>

6
00:00:24.621 --> 00:00:27.370
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

7
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.230
<v Speaker 1>so I've noticed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're getting funnier.</v>

8
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

9
00:00:33.351 --> 00:00:35.570
<v Speaker 1>I think Michael Koren said that this</v>
<v Speaker 1>week I think,</v>

10
00:00:35.571 --> 00:00:37.640
<v Speaker 1>but the word he used was bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

11
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.120
<v Speaker 1>actually I'm feeling better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's.</v>

12
00:00:41.121 --> 00:00:44.150
<v Speaker 1>I actually have a sense of humor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to believe that,</v>

13
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.670
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it sort of comes back when I'm not</v>

14
00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:48.560
<v Speaker 1>feeling like I'm going to die at any</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>

15
00:00:48.561 --> 00:00:53.500
<v Speaker 1>So I basically noticed one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're making more attempts a jokes,</v>

16
00:00:53.501 --> 00:00:54.334
<v Speaker 1>so that's great.</v>

17
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.900
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

18
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.170
<v Speaker 1>Those jokes are landing more often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there's this third element</v>

19
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.650
<v Speaker 1>which I think was what Steve Martin quit</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of,</v>

20
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.120
<v Speaker 1>which is that I think the audience is</v>
<v Speaker 1>anticipating jokes more and they're</v>

21
00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.300
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.300
<v Speaker 1>I've noticed people laughing more at</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that aren't intending to be</v>

23
00:01:19.301 --> 00:01:21.580
<v Speaker 1>jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was just wondering what you make of</v>

24
00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:23.710
<v Speaker 1>that and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their intended.</v>

25
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping they're intended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just because I keep a straight face</v>

26
00:01:27.011 --> 00:01:28.960
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean they're not intended to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>jokes.</v>

27
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.460
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

28
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.301
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good.</v>

29
00:01:31.301 --> 00:01:32.670
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things is like,</v>

30
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.450
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've tried to keep this,</v>

31
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.290
<v Speaker 1>I learned a while ago probably about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>five years ago,</v>

32
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.220
<v Speaker 1>and even when you're dealing with really</v>
<v Speaker 1>serious matters that if you're not</v>

33
00:01:41.221 --> 00:01:44.130
<v Speaker 1>handling it with a light touch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not an expert at it.</v>

34
00:01:44.131 --> 00:01:46.500
<v Speaker 1>You're not a master at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you'd think while there are some</v>

35
00:01:46.501 --> 00:01:50.010
<v Speaker 1>things that are so deep and dark that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't handle it with a light touch.</v>

36
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.460
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>

37
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.860
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean you make light of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

38
00:01:55.861 --> 00:01:58.020
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that you don't,</v>

39
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.090
<v Speaker 1>it's minimal necessary force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

40
00:02:02.091 --> 00:02:04.280
<v Speaker 1>You don't hit it any harder than you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to.</v>

41
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.650
<v Speaker 1>And it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an art when you're discussing</v>

42
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.270
<v Speaker 1>serious matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

43
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.240
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the upshots of that is that</v>

44
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.200
<v Speaker 1>because we're discussing serious matters</v>
<v Speaker 1>and because serious matters are being</v>

45
00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:16.850
<v Speaker 1>discussed in the ultra at large right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

46
00:02:16.851 --> 00:02:19.550
<v Speaker 1>it would be really good if everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>could keep their sense of humor,</v>

47
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I see positive signs of that.</v>

48
00:02:22.131 --> 00:02:25.070
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lot of satirical activity</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the net,</v>

49
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that could easily categorize into</v>

50
00:02:27.321 --> 00:02:29.420
<v Speaker 1>horror mob.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it isn't,</v>

51
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:30.530
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

52
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.670
<v Speaker 1>That's happening to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of it's satire and comedy and</v>

53
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.430
<v Speaker 1>as long as we can keep a sense of humor</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this,</v>

54
00:02:37.431 --> 00:02:42.020
<v Speaker 1>then I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we're not as close to disaster as</v>

55
00:02:42.021 --> 00:02:42.830
<v Speaker 1>we might be.</v>

56
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.320
<v Speaker 1>And so what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I have found</v>

57
00:02:45.321 --> 00:02:47.630
<v Speaker 1>rather ominous is that there are</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedians,</v>

58
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.050
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being persecuted for under free speech</v>

59
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.470
<v Speaker 1>restriction legislation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is absolutely appalling.</v>

60
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.950
<v Speaker 1>But also that there are comedians now</v>
<v Speaker 1>who won't perform on university</v>

61
00:02:57.951 --> 00:02:59.680
<v Speaker 1>campuses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John won't</v>

62
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.490
<v Speaker 1>Seinfeld as like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

63
00:03:03.491 --> 00:03:05.430
<v Speaker 1>you know how offensive he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no wonder that.</v>

64
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's like the straightest nicest</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedian you could possibly imagine.</v>

65
00:03:10.031 --> 00:03:14.290
<v Speaker 1>He won't perform on college campuses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Louis Ck won't perform or or</v>

66
00:03:14.291 --> 00:03:19.090
<v Speaker 1>anywhere else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a bad sign.</v>

67
00:03:19.091 --> 00:03:22.210
<v Speaker 1>But no humor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Humors is good and it's interesting</v>

68
00:03:22.211 --> 00:03:27.010
<v Speaker 1>because I've been kind of watching how</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm represented on the web weirdly</v>

69
00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:30.130
<v Speaker 1>enough and there's all these memes that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have emerged,</v>

70
00:03:30.131 --> 00:03:34.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of the bloody things and most</v>

71
00:03:34.061 --> 00:03:37.560
<v Speaker 1>of them are comical and that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people are,</v>

72
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:38.620
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

73
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.650
<v Speaker 1>they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is that they're doing.</v>

74
00:03:41.651 --> 00:03:44.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the hell it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's being done with a relatively</v>

75
00:03:44.711 --> 00:03:46.930
<v Speaker 1>light touch and that's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good.</v>

76
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.720
<v Speaker 1>That's how it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to have a sense of humor.</v>

77
00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the things that makes life</v>

78
00:03:51.671 --> 00:03:54.640
<v Speaker 1>bearable so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe even better than bearable.</v>

79
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:55.180
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
