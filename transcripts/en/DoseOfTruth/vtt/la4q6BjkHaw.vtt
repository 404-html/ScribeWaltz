1
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.213
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

2
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:10.600
<v Speaker 1>Jacob gets away with this,</v>

3
00:00:10.601 --> 00:00:12.980
<v Speaker 1>but Esau is not happy and,</v>

4
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.880
<v Speaker 1>and Jacob is quite convinced that he might kill them.</v>

5
00:00:15.881 --> 00:00:19.330
<v Speaker 1>And I think that was a reasonable fear because he saw was a tough guy and he was</v>

6
00:00:19.331 --> 00:00:23.620
<v Speaker 1>used to being outside and he knew how to hunt and he knew how to kill and he</v>

7
00:00:23.621 --> 00:00:27.760
<v Speaker 1>actually wasn't very happy about getting seriously screwed over by his,</v>

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.820
<v Speaker 1>stay at home younger brother twice.</v>

10
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.710
<v Speaker 1>And so Jacob runs off and goes to visit his uncle and on the way,</v>

11
00:00:35.711 --> 00:00:37.840
<v Speaker 1>and this is a very interesting part of the story,</v>

12
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.410
<v Speaker 1>he stops and to sleep and he takes a stone for a pillow and then he has this</v>

13
00:00:44.861 --> 00:00:45.670
<v Speaker 1>vision,</v>

14
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:46.630
<v Speaker 1>it's called a dream,</v>

15
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.260
<v Speaker 1>but the context makes it look like a vision of a ladder reaching up to heaven</v>

16
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.370
<v Speaker 1>and with angels moving up and down the ladder,</v>

17
00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.263
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

18
00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.790
<v Speaker 1>And there are some representations of that.</v>

19
00:01:00.791 --> 00:01:03.040
<v Speaker 1>I showed you some of them the last time we met,</v>

20
00:01:03.041 --> 00:01:05.590
<v Speaker 1>but I'll read it to you first.</v>

21
00:01:05.591 --> 00:01:07.510
<v Speaker 1>And he lighted upon a certain place and tired.</v>

22
00:01:07.511 --> 00:01:10.390
<v Speaker 1>They're all night because the sun was set and he took of the stones of that</v>

23
00:01:10.391 --> 00:01:14.080
<v Speaker 1>place and put them for his pillows and laid down in that place to sleep.</v>

24
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.920
<v Speaker 1>And he dreamed and beheld a ladder set up on the earth.</v>

25
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.570
<v Speaker 1>And the top of it reached to heaven.</v>

26
00:01:19.571 --> 00:01:20.404
<v Speaker 1>And behold,</v>

27
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.050
<v Speaker 1>the angels of God ascending and descending on it.</v>

28
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:23.951
<v Speaker 1>And behold,</v>

29
00:01:23.951 --> 00:01:25.300
<v Speaker 1>the Lord stood above it and said,</v>

30
00:01:25.301 --> 00:01:26.740
<v Speaker 1>I am the Lord God of Abraham,</v>

31
00:01:26.741 --> 00:01:29.380
<v Speaker 1>thy father and the god of Isaac,</v>

32
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.780
<v Speaker 1>the land where on the Elias to the,</v>

33
00:01:31.781 --> 00:01:33.460
<v Speaker 1>I will give it Nti seed.</v>

34
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.180
<v Speaker 1>And I see Chubby as the dust of the earth and thou shalt spread abroad to the</v>

35
00:01:37.181 --> 00:01:39.430
<v Speaker 1>west and to the east and to the north and the south.</v>

36
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.130
<v Speaker 1>So that lays out the canonical directions,</v>

37
00:01:42.131 --> 00:01:42.371
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

38
00:01:42.371 --> 00:01:45.430
<v Speaker 1>So now there's a center with the canonical directions,</v>

39
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.600
<v Speaker 1>like the thing that you see,</v>

40
00:01:46.601 --> 00:01:46.811
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:01:46.811 --> 00:01:48.580
<v Speaker 1>that little symbol you see on maps,</v>

42
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.330
<v Speaker 1>it's the same thing that symbolically placed upon the earth.</v>

43
00:01:52.331 --> 00:01:55.750
<v Speaker 1>So a center has been established with radiating,</v>

44
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

45
00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:57.311
<v Speaker 1>well with,</v>

46
00:01:57.311 --> 00:01:57.880
<v Speaker 1>with what?</v>

47
00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.121
<v Speaker 1>With,</v>

48
00:01:58.121 --> 00:02:01.000
<v Speaker 1>with direction lines radiating from it.</v>

49
00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:02.160
<v Speaker 1>So it establishes as,</v>

50
00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.280
<v Speaker 1>as a place</v>

51
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.320
<v Speaker 1>and in the young nice seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.</v>

52
00:02:08.321 --> 00:02:12.010
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty good news for Jacob and it's not self evident why God is</v>

53
00:02:12.011 --> 00:02:15.280
<v Speaker 1>rewarding him for running away after screwing over his brother.</v>

54
00:02:15.281 --> 00:02:17.170
<v Speaker 1>But that seems to be what happens.</v>

55
00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.200
<v Speaker 1>And so here's a couple of representations,</v>

56
00:02:20.201 --> 00:02:21.760
<v Speaker 1>classic representations.</v>

57
00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.870
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

58
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.990
<v Speaker 1>the one on the right is William Blake has when I particularly like,</v>

59
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

60
00:02:27.641 --> 00:02:32.590
<v Speaker 1>and Blake assimilates God with the sun when with light,</v>

61
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:33.503
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

62
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.580
<v Speaker 1>So that's quite an common mythological idea that that God is associated with</v>

63
00:02:39.311 --> 00:02:40.780
<v Speaker 1>light and the day</v>

64
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.460
<v Speaker 1>will not leave thee until I have done that,</v>

65
00:02:47.461 --> 00:02:51.180
<v Speaker 1>which I have spoken to the and Jacob awaked out of his sleep and he said,</v>

66
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.910
<v Speaker 1>surely the Lord is in this place and I knew what not.</v>

67
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.110
<v Speaker 1>And he was afraid,</v>

68
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.320
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly the right response and said,</v>

69
00:02:58.321 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>how dreadful is this place?</v>

70
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.430
<v Speaker 1>It is none other than the house of God and this is the gate of heaven.</v>

71
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.090
<v Speaker 1>And Jacob Rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put for</v>

72
00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:10.870
<v Speaker 1>his pillows and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on the top of it.</v>

73
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.500
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

74
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.540
<v Speaker 1>that's a more important thing than you think.</v>

75
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.181
<v Speaker 1>And what,</v>

76
00:03:14.181 --> 00:03:18.020
<v Speaker 1>we'll go into that a little bit more deeply because up to this point in the</v>

77
00:03:18.021 --> 00:03:18.640
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>

78
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.170
<v Speaker 1>there isn't anything really,</v>

79
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.250
<v Speaker 1>there isn't anything that's really emerged to mark a sacred space,</v>

80
00:03:24.251 --> 00:03:24.551
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

81
00:03:24.551 --> 00:03:25.000
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>

82
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.990
<v Speaker 1>there's no cathedral,</v>

83
00:03:25.991 --> 00:03:26.771
<v Speaker 1>there's no church,</v>

84
00:03:26.771 --> 00:03:27.820
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing like that.</v>

85
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.230
<v Speaker 1>But here's this idea that emerges that you can mark the center of something</v>

86
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:33.250
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

87
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.061
<v Speaker 1>and that's important.</v>

88
00:03:34.061 --> 00:03:38.230
<v Speaker 1>Any market with a stone and a stone is a good way to mark things that,</v>

89
00:03:38.231 --> 00:03:40.270
<v Speaker 1>that are important because the stone is permanent,</v>

90
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

91
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.520
<v Speaker 1>And we mark things with stones now,</v>

92
00:03:42.521 --> 00:03:44.590
<v Speaker 1>like we marked graves with stones for example,</v>

93
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.550
<v Speaker 1>because we want to make a memory and to carve something into stone,</v>

94
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.330
<v Speaker 1>to carve a stone and then to carve something into stone is to make a memory and</v>

95
00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:55.540
<v Speaker 1>to use stone is to make a memory because stone is permanent.</v>

96
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.990
<v Speaker 1>And to set it up right is to indicate a center.</v>

97
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.040
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what happens in pours oil on the top of it,</v>

98
00:04:03.041 --> 00:04:04.300
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of offering,</v>

99
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.670
<v Speaker 1>and he called the name of that place Bethel.</v>

100
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.100
<v Speaker 1>But the name of the city was called [inaudible] at the first.</v>

101
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.920
<v Speaker 1>And Jacob vowed a vow saying,</v>

102
00:04:11.921 --> 00:04:14.200
<v Speaker 1>if God will be with me and we'll keep me in this way,</v>

103
00:04:14.201 --> 00:04:17.050
<v Speaker 1>that I go and will give me bread to eat and Raymond to put on.</v>

104
00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.870
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

105
00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.120
<v Speaker 1>Then a 10th of what I earn,</v>

106
00:04:26.121 --> 00:04:26.954
<v Speaker 1>I will give him.</v>

107
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.183
<v Speaker 1>I missed that.</v>

108
00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:30.710
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting too,</v>

109
00:04:30.711 --> 00:04:33.260
<v Speaker 1>because now there's a transformation of sacrifice,</v>

110
00:04:33.261 --> 00:04:33.471
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

111
00:04:33.471 --> 00:04:35.090
<v Speaker 1>Because until that point,</v>

112
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.420
<v Speaker 1>sacrifices have had been pretty concretized.</v>

113
00:04:38.421 --> 00:04:39.770
<v Speaker 1>It was the burning of something.</v>

114
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.881
<v Speaker 1>Whereas here,</v>

115
00:04:40.881 --> 00:04:42.830
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden it's the offering of,</v>

116
00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.580
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

117
00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:44.413
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

118
00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.330
<v Speaker 1>of productive labor per se,</v>

119
00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:48.223
<v Speaker 1>like a tie,</v>

120
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.000
<v Speaker 1>because the tie,</v>

121
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.360
<v Speaker 1>there's a form of sacrifice.</v>

122
00:04:50.361 --> 00:04:52.790
<v Speaker 1>And so there's an abstraction of the idea of sacrifice,</v>

123
00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.953
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice.</v>

124
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.890
<v Speaker 1>It's really important that the idea of sacrifice gets abstracted,</v>

125
00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.701
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

126
00:04:58.701 --> 00:05:01.790
<v Speaker 1>Because it should be abstracted to the point where it's,</v>

127
00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.250
<v Speaker 1>it's used the way that we use it today,</v>

128
00:05:04.251 --> 00:05:04.761
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

129
00:05:04.761 --> 00:05:05.001
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

130
00:05:05.001 --> 00:05:08.810
<v Speaker 1>we make sacrifices to get ahead and everyone understands what that means.</v>

131
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.990
<v Speaker 1>But the sacrifices are generally some combination of psychological lend and,</v>

132
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:16.400
<v Speaker 1>and practical.</v>

133
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:21.110
<v Speaker 1>So we're not acting them out where it precisely we're not dramatizing them or</v>

134
00:05:21.111 --> 00:05:23.600
<v Speaker 1>ritualizing and we actually act them out in our,</v>

135
00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.850
<v Speaker 1>in the covenant that we make with the future.</v>

136
00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.680
<v Speaker 1>And we do that well.</v>

137
00:05:27.681 --> 00:05:31.730
<v Speaker 1>Unless we're extraordinarily impulsive and aimless in our lives and have really</v>

138
00:05:31.731 --> 00:05:36.200
<v Speaker 1>no conception whatsoever of the future and are likely to sacrifice the future</v>

139
00:05:36.201 --> 00:05:36.861
<v Speaker 1>for the present,</v>

140
00:05:36.861 --> 00:05:38.990
<v Speaker 1>which is what he saw does right?</v>

141
00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:44.260
<v Speaker 1>Then we make sacrifices and you gotta think like the idea of making sacrifices</v>

142
00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.730
<v Speaker 1>to make the future better is an extraordinarily difficult lesson to learn.</v>

143
00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:50.750
<v Speaker 1>It took people,</v>

144
00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.020
<v Speaker 1>God only knows how long to learn that,</v>

145
00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

146
00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.180
<v Speaker 1>like we,</v>

147
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.210
<v Speaker 1>we have no idea.</v>

148
00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.670
<v Speaker 1>It's something that animals do easily.</v>

149
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.520
<v Speaker 1>Chimpanzees don't store leftover meat,</v>

150
00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:02.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

151
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:03.710
<v Speaker 1>they just needed a wolf.</v>

152
00:06:03.711 --> 00:06:04.041
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>

153
00:06:04.041 --> 00:06:06.740
<v Speaker 1>wolf can eat about 30 pounds of meat in one setting.</v>

154
00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:10.190
<v Speaker 1>And that's where the idea of wolfing it down comes from.</v>

155
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.270
<v Speaker 1>They're not hiding it,</v>

156
00:06:11.271 --> 00:06:12.380
<v Speaker 1>saving it for later.</v>

157
00:06:12.381 --> 00:06:12.621
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

158
00:06:12.621 --> 00:06:13.640
<v Speaker 1>they can't do that,</v>

159
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.630
<v Speaker 1>so they can't sacrifice the present for the future.</v>
