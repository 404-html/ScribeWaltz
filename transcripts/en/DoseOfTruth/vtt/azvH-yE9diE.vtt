00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.470
<v Speaker 1>I knew of this native carver.</v>

2
00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:06.060
<v Speaker 1>He's a Kwakwaka'wakw guy.</v>

3
00:00:06.061 --> 00:00:09.870
<v Speaker 1>He's carved a bunch of wooden sculptures,</v>

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.240
<v Speaker 1>totem poles and masks that I have in my house.</v>

5
00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:14.100
<v Speaker 1>And he's a very interesting person,</v>

6
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.091
<v Speaker 1>not literate,</v>

7
00:00:15.091 --> 00:00:16.320
<v Speaker 1>not particularly literate,</v>

8
00:00:16.321 --> 00:00:20.340
<v Speaker 1>and really still steeped in this ancient 13,000 year old tradition.</v>

9
00:00:20.341 --> 00:00:22.380
<v Speaker 1>He's an original language speaker.</v>

10
00:00:22.381 --> 00:00:22.970
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

11
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:23.803
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

12
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.660
<v Speaker 1>the fact that he hasn't literate has sort of left hand with the mind of someone</v>

13
00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:30.420
<v Speaker 1>who's preliterate and preliterate people aren't stupid,</v>

14
00:00:30.421 --> 00:00:31.380
<v Speaker 1>they're just not literate.</v>

15
00:00:31.381 --> 00:00:34.330
<v Speaker 1>So their brains are organized differently in many ways.</v>

16
00:00:34.331 --> 00:00:36.090
<v Speaker 1>And I've asked him about his,</v>

17
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.450
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

18
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.450
<v Speaker 1>his intuition for his carvings and he's told me that he dreams,</v>

19
00:00:41.521 --> 00:00:43.320
<v Speaker 1>like you've seen the Haida masks,</v>

20
00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:44.310
<v Speaker 1>you know what they look like?</v>

21
00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:44.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

22
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:45.970
<v Speaker 1>his people are,</v>

23
00:00:45.971 --> 00:00:48.180
<v Speaker 1>are closely related to the Haida,</v>

24
00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:49.950
<v Speaker 1>so it's the same kind of style.</v>

25
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.820
<v Speaker 1>And he said he dreams in those animals and,</v>

26
00:00:53.821 --> 00:00:55.260
<v Speaker 1>and can remember his dreams.</v>

27
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.490
<v Speaker 1>And he also talks to his grandparents who taught them how to carve in his</v>

28
00:00:59.491 --> 00:01:00.001
<v Speaker 1>dreams.</v>

29
00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:02.220
<v Speaker 1>Quite often if he runs into a problem with carving,</v>

30
00:01:02.221 --> 00:01:03.870
<v Speaker 1>his grandparents will come and he'll talk to them.</v>

31
00:01:03.871 --> 00:01:08.871
<v Speaker 1>But he sees that the creatures that he's going to carve living in an animated</v>

32
00:01:09.451 --> 00:01:11.460
<v Speaker 1>San soon as in his imagination.</v>

33
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.260
<v Speaker 1>And I mean it's not that difficult.</v>

34
00:01:13.261 --> 00:01:13.741
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

35
00:01:13.741 --> 00:01:15.060
<v Speaker 1>I have no reason to disbelieve him.</v>

36
00:01:15.061 --> 00:01:15.631
<v Speaker 1>He's a very,</v>

37
00:01:15.631 --> 00:01:20.631
<v Speaker 1>very straightforward person and he doesn't have the motivation or the guy all I</v>

38
00:01:20.701 --> 00:01:23.100
<v Speaker 1>would say in some sense to invent a story like that.</v>

39
00:01:23.101 --> 00:01:25.290
<v Speaker 1>There's just no reason that you would possibly do it.</v>

40
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's told that many people about it.</v>

41
00:01:27.541 --> 00:01:28.740
<v Speaker 1>He thinks it's kind of crazy.</v>

42
00:01:28.741 --> 00:01:29.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

43
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.450
<v Speaker 1>he said when he was a kid,</v>

44
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.070
<v Speaker 1>he thought he was insane because he'd had those dreams all the time about these</v>

45
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:36.630
<v Speaker 1>creatures and so forth.</v>

46
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.700
<v Speaker 1>And so it wasn't something he was trumpeting.</v>

47
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.150
<v Speaker 1>But I found it fascinating because I can see in him part of the manifestation of</v>

48
00:01:44.701 --> 00:01:46.260
<v Speaker 1>this unbroken tradition,</v>

49
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.790
<v Speaker 1>we have no idea how traditions like that are really passed along for thousands</v>

50
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.791
<v Speaker 1>and thousands of years.</v>

51
00:01:50.791 --> 00:01:51.240
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

52
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.610
<v Speaker 1>Part of it's oral and memory,</v>

53
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.850
<v Speaker 1>part of it's acted out and dramatized and then part of it's going to be</v>

54
00:01:56.851 --> 00:01:57.780
<v Speaker 1>imaginative.</v>

55
00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.520
<v Speaker 1>And people who aren't literate,</v>

56
00:01:59.521 --> 00:02:01.650
<v Speaker 1>they store information quite differently than we do.</v>

57
00:02:01.651 --> 00:02:02.760
<v Speaker 1>We don't remember anything.</v>

58
00:02:02.761 --> 00:02:04.080
<v Speaker 1>It's all written down in books,</v>

59
00:02:04.081 --> 00:02:04.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

60
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.060
<v Speaker 1>But if you're from an oral culture,</v>

61
00:02:06.061 --> 00:02:07.350
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're trained in that way,</v>

62
00:02:07.351 --> 00:02:09.630
<v Speaker 1>you have all of that information at hand,</v>

63
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:10.501
<v Speaker 1>both.</v>

64
00:02:10.501 --> 00:02:11.400
<v Speaker 1>So you can speak it,</v>

65
00:02:11.401 --> 00:02:14.430
<v Speaker 1>you can tell the stories and you really know them and you know,</v>

66
00:02:14.431 --> 00:02:16.590
<v Speaker 1>modern people don't really know what that's like anymore.</v>
