00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.330
<v Speaker 1>Steve has the first question,</v>

2
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.320
<v Speaker 1>how can we know the difference between unhealthy repression and healthy self</v>

3
00:00:12.321 --> 00:00:13.730
<v Speaker 1>restraint of sexuality?</v>

4
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:15.141
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5
00:00:15.141 --> 00:00:15.974
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

6
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.290
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

7
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.510
<v Speaker 1>no part of what constitutes ethics,</v>

8
00:00:22.511 --> 00:00:23.800
<v Speaker 1>let's say first of all,</v>

9
00:00:23.801 --> 00:00:24.430
<v Speaker 1>let's start,</v>

10
00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.140
<v Speaker 1>let's think about ethics to begin with.</v>

11
00:00:26.141 --> 00:00:30.730
<v Speaker 1>So what's the point of conducting your life ethically?</v>

12
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.360
<v Speaker 1>The answer to that isn't so that you follow the proper rules precisely the,</v>

13
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.650
<v Speaker 1>the answer to that is so that you balance your life so that it says productive</v>

14
00:00:41.651 --> 00:00:43.510
<v Speaker 1>and meaningful as it can possibly be.</v>

15
00:00:43.511 --> 00:00:46.870
<v Speaker 1>And that would be productive and meaningful for you with any luck,</v>

16
00:00:46.871 --> 00:00:50.740
<v Speaker 1>but also for people around you that would even be better.</v>

17
00:00:50.741 --> 00:00:50.861
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

18
00:00:50.861 --> 00:00:54.760
<v Speaker 1>and for you now and next week and into the future.</v>

19
00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.270
<v Speaker 1>So it's sort of a variation of the philosopher Emmanuel counts moral dictum,</v>

20
00:01:00.341 --> 00:01:04.120
<v Speaker 1>which was act such that your action becomes a moral,</v>

21
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.320
<v Speaker 1>a universal,</v>

22
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:06.101
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

23
00:01:06.101 --> 00:01:06.950
<v Speaker 1>Although I think that it's,</v>

24
00:01:06.951 --> 00:01:10.780
<v Speaker 1>it's better phrased across time and across people like that.</v>

25
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:12.663
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

26
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.810
<v Speaker 1>so when you're thinking about an ethic that has to do with any fundamental</v>

27
00:01:16.811 --> 00:01:18.250
<v Speaker 1>motivation like sexuality,</v>

28
00:01:18.251 --> 00:01:22.030
<v Speaker 1>you have to think about it in the context of the rest of your life.</v>

29
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.313
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

30
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:24.370
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

31
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.780
<v Speaker 1>the question is whether or not,</v>

32
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:27.460
<v Speaker 1>but what did I say?</v>

33
00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.850
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

34
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.060
<v Speaker 1>what did I read at one point that I really liked with regards to sexuality?</v>

35
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.573
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

36
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:34.760
<v Speaker 1>who's in control?</v>

37
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.163
<v Speaker 1>That's the issue.</v>

38
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.740
<v Speaker 1>Is it you or is it the sexuality that's in control is have you integrated your</v>

39
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.970
<v Speaker 1>sexual life into the rest of your life so that the whole thing makes a</v>

40
00:01:46.971 --> 00:01:48.260
<v Speaker 1>harmonious balance?</v>

41
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.140
<v Speaker 1>And Are you in charge or is it in charge,</v>

42
00:01:51.141 --> 00:01:51.741
<v Speaker 1>so to speak?</v>

43
00:01:51.741 --> 00:01:55.550
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're not in charge with that harmonious balance,</v>

44
00:01:55.551 --> 00:01:59.390
<v Speaker 1>then things are going to waver wildly out of control and you're going to find</v>

45
00:01:59.391 --> 00:02:00.830
<v Speaker 1>yourself in dreadful trouble.</v>

46
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.790
<v Speaker 1>That happens whenever any given driver may really any given value predominates</v>

47
00:02:07.521 --> 00:02:09.140
<v Speaker 1>to the exclusion of all else.</v>

48
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.303
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

49
00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.800
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that sexuality is best handled within the confines of a</v>

50
00:02:15.801 --> 00:02:16.634
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>

51
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.143
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

52
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.410
<v Speaker 1>that's the classic ethical solution to the problem.</v>

53
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.630
<v Speaker 1>It's because sexuality brings with it a tremendous amount of responsibility.</v>

54
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.811
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

55
00:02:26.811 --> 00:02:28.070
<v Speaker 1>people don't like to think that,</v>

56
00:02:28.071 --> 00:02:31.070
<v Speaker 1>especially people who I would say are low in conscientiousness,</v>

57
00:02:31.071 --> 00:02:32.810
<v Speaker 1>let's say are high in impulsivity.</v>

58
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.050
<v Speaker 1>It's easy for people to believe in,</v>

59
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.700
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>

60
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:38.810
<v Speaker 1>Casual sex,</v>

61
00:02:38.811 --> 00:02:42.110
<v Speaker 1>which is not something that I think exists because I don't think you can divorce</v>

62
00:02:42.111 --> 00:02:47.060
<v Speaker 1>sex from its sociological or political or economic or psychological</v>

63
00:02:47.061 --> 00:02:47.811
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>

64
00:02:47.811 --> 00:02:52.811
<v Speaker 1>And I would say the endless scandals that have plagued the United States in</v>

65
00:02:53.541 --> 00:02:58.541
<v Speaker 1>particular in the last year with regards to sexual behavior are proof that</v>

66
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.260
<v Speaker 1>there's no such thing as casual sex.</v>

67
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.000
<v Speaker 1>I think the reason for that is that the consequences of sex are too dramatic.</v>

68
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.180
<v Speaker 1>It's not just pregnancy and disease,</v>

69
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.691
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

70
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:11.524
<v Speaker 1>which are both,</v>

71
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.843
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

72
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.050
<v Speaker 1>as dramatic as consequences can be in life,</v>

73
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.430
<v Speaker 1>but also the fact that</v>

74
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.380
<v Speaker 1>there's no disentangling sexual behavior from an emotional behavior.</v>

75
00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:26.920
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe you could say even worse if you try to disentangle your sexual behavior</v>

76
00:03:26.921 --> 00:03:28.150
<v Speaker 1>from your emotional behavior,</v>

77
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.840
<v Speaker 1>then I think what happens is that you end up cold and cynical.</v>

78
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

79
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:33.280
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

80
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.190
<v Speaker 1>let's say if you're a a cereal,</v>

81
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.250
<v Speaker 1>if you're us,</v>

82
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:37.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

83
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.630
<v Speaker 1>if you have a lot of one night stands and a lot of casual partners,</v>

84
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.850
<v Speaker 1>then first of all,</v>

85
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.610
<v Speaker 1>there's not much discrimination between one partner and the other.</v>

86
00:03:45.611 --> 00:03:49.780
<v Speaker 1>And so in some sense you're in a loop and just repeating the same act over and</v>

87
00:03:49.781 --> 00:03:50.021
<v Speaker 1>over,</v>

88
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:51.280
<v Speaker 1>but you can't,</v>

89
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.230
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing deep about it.</v>

90
00:03:53.231 --> 00:03:54.550
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing that,</v>

91
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.520
<v Speaker 1>that enables you to establish a relationship with another person.</v>

92
00:03:57.521 --> 00:03:58.570
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's a,</v>

93
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.790
<v Speaker 1>I think that you corrupt your soul in that way and that you hurt yourself across</v>

94
00:04:03.791 --> 00:04:06.130
<v Speaker 1>time and of course you're going to hurt other people as well.</v>

95
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.710
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not a big admirer of the casual sex idea.</v>

96
00:04:08.711 --> 00:04:12.310
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a demented adolescents fantasy.</v>

97
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:13.030
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

98
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.090
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally it just doesn't work out in the real world.</v>

99
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.770
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

100
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:19.030
<v Speaker 1>healthy self restraint.</v>

101
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

102
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.680
<v Speaker 1>with regards to sexuality,</v>

103
00:04:20.681 --> 00:04:23.230
<v Speaker 1>it's the same with everything else is that there's,</v>

104
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.060
<v Speaker 1>there's the necessity to forego immediate gratification for the purpose of</v>

105
00:04:28.061 --> 00:04:30.160
<v Speaker 1>medium to longterm thriving,</v>

106
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.023
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

107
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.360
<v Speaker 1>So if your sexualities integrated in an ethic that encompasses the rest of your</v>

108
00:04:36.641 --> 00:04:36.911
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

109
00:04:36.911 --> 00:04:38.560
<v Speaker 1>and if it serves that ethic,</v>

110
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.130
<v Speaker 1>then I would say it's properly restrained.</v>

111
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.200
<v Speaker 1>If it's unhealthily repressed,</v>

112
00:04:44.201 --> 00:04:49.201
<v Speaker 1>well then you're angry and bitter and resentful and cursing the opposite sex,</v>

113
00:04:49.811 --> 00:04:50.980
<v Speaker 1>or perhaps the same sex.</v>

114
00:04:50.981 --> 00:04:55.981
<v Speaker 1>If you happen to be gay for failing to recognize your particular form of sexual,</v>

115
00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

116
00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.480
<v Speaker 1>what would you call attractiveness?</v>

117
00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.050
<v Speaker 1>I think resentment and anger are a good indication that there's something wrong</v>

118
00:05:02.051 --> 00:05:05.110
<v Speaker 1>with the manner in which your sexuality is restraint.</v>

119
00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.410
<v Speaker 1>So I hope hopefully that's a decent answer.</v>
