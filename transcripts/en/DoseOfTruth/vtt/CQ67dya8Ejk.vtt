1
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:07.801
<v Speaker 1>Dr Peterson's.</v>

2
00:00:07.801 --> 00:00:08.181
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

3
00:00:08.181 --> 00:00:09.014
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

4
00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:10.520
<v Speaker 1>it's great pleasure being here.</v>

5
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.230
<v Speaker 1>It's awesome to see you live.</v>

6
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.153
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

7
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.240
<v Speaker 1>I basically got into your wicks just earlier this year and I had an original</v>

8
00:00:17.241 --> 00:00:17.691
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>

9
00:00:17.691 --> 00:00:20.330
<v Speaker 1>but your talk today kind of made me decide to change my mind.</v>

10
00:00:20.331 --> 00:00:21.164
<v Speaker 1>I'm always going to ask.</v>

11
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:22.430
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

12
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.430
<v Speaker 1>do you feel as though would you agree with me and the sentiment that the left</v>

13
00:00:27.651 --> 00:00:32.651
<v Speaker 1>has pushed so hard for total control of our society over the last however many</v>

14
00:00:32.721 --> 00:00:33.554
<v Speaker 1>years?</v>

15
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.400
<v Speaker 1>It's almost to a point,</v>

16
00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:36.740
<v Speaker 1>we're saying 2013 was a different time.</v>

17
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.113
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

18
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.510
<v Speaker 1>would you say that because they pushed so hard,</v>

19
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.860
<v Speaker 1>they've created this backlash and the backlash created,</v>

20
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.810
<v Speaker 1>caused them to backlash back again.</v>

21
00:00:47.811 --> 00:00:50.720
<v Speaker 1>So they doubled down with their ideology and then they get,</v>

22
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.550
<v Speaker 1>they lose another argument,</v>

23
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.370
<v Speaker 1>they lose another ideological war.</v>

24
00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.260
<v Speaker 1>They news losing other me more and they doubled down and doubled down again and</v>

25
00:01:00.261 --> 00:01:00.860
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

26
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.420
<v Speaker 1>And they still can't seem to meme,</v>

27
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:03.920
<v Speaker 1>they can't seem to argue.</v>

28
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.911
<v Speaker 1>They can't seem,</v>

29
00:01:04.911 --> 00:01:05.450
<v Speaker 1>they can't,</v>

30
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.430
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to have an intellectual discussion.</v>

31
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.000
<v Speaker 1>And as an as an interpretation of what you were saying,</v>

32
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.880
<v Speaker 1>there is no,</v>

33
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.280
<v Speaker 1>there doesn't seem to be any,</v>

34
00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:14.114
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>

35
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.220
<v Speaker 1>any care of what's right with them.</v>

36
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.870
<v Speaker 1>They just want power.</v>

37
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.733
<v Speaker 1>They just want,</v>

38
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.150
<v Speaker 1>they just want to win.</v>

39
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

40
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.063
<v Speaker 1>do you,</v>

41
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.950
<v Speaker 1>would you agree with the sentiment that they're burning themselves out and</v>

42
00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:27.770
<v Speaker 1>creating the mass red pilling of the,</v>

43
00:01:27.771 --> 00:01:28.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

44
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.410
<v Speaker 1>conservative movement that we see going on?</v>

45
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.860
<v Speaker 1>Would you possibly think that maybe they've committed suicide and,</v>

46
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.750
<v Speaker 1>and talks like this,</v>

47
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.100
<v Speaker 1>people like yourself,</v>

48
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.160
<v Speaker 1>Ben Shapiro and others who talk to people like what the subjects that we do the</v>

49
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.360
<v Speaker 1>taboo of nowadays?</v>

50
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.553
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

51
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.050
<v Speaker 1>possibly that this,</v>

52
00:01:48.051 --> 00:01:50.600
<v Speaker 1>this is the answer to defeat the,</v>

53
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.750
<v Speaker 1>the leftist stranglehold.</v>

54
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.541
<v Speaker 1>It's on our society.</v>

55
00:01:53.541 --> 00:01:53.860
<v Speaker 1>Let,</v>

56
00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.120
<v Speaker 1>will untangle some of that.</v>

57
00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.421
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

58
00:01:55.421 --> 00:01:56.320
<v Speaker 1>So first of all,</v>

59
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.551
<v Speaker 1>well first of all,</v>

60
00:01:57.551 --> 00:02:01.360
<v Speaker 1>the first observation is a really interesting one because you know that things</v>

61
00:02:01.361 --> 00:02:02.560
<v Speaker 1>can go out of hand very,</v>

62
00:02:02.561 --> 00:02:03.400
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly.</v>

63
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

64
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.030
<v Speaker 1>And the reason they do that is because of positive feedback loops.</v>

65
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.780
<v Speaker 1>Now the thing that Kurzweil talks about is a positive feedback loop and</v>

66
00:02:10.781 --> 00:02:13.960
<v Speaker 1>intelligent machine makes another intelligent machine that makes another</v>

67
00:02:13.961 --> 00:02:15.070
<v Speaker 1>intelligent machine.</v>

68
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.690
<v Speaker 1>And that's a positive feedback loop and that can spiral upwards out of control</v>

69
00:02:19.691 --> 00:02:20.381
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly.</v>

70
00:02:20.381 --> 00:02:22.090
<v Speaker 1>And that's what polarization is.</v>

71
00:02:22.091 --> 00:02:23.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like I tap you,</v>

72
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.090
<v Speaker 1>you tap me,</v>

73
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.050
<v Speaker 1>I slap you,</v>

74
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.980
<v Speaker 1>you punch me well up and goes well.</v>

75
00:02:29.981 --> 00:02:32.230
<v Speaker 1>I think that's partly why in the New Testament,</v>

76
00:02:32.231 --> 00:02:32.771
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

77
00:02:32.771 --> 00:02:36.340
<v Speaker 1>there's an injunction that says turn the other cheek,</v>

78
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.110
<v Speaker 1>resist not evil.</v>

79
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:39.603
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

80
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.080
<v Speaker 1>Because otherwise you get into a positive feedback loop and then you better look</v>

81
00:02:44.081 --> 00:02:46.420
<v Speaker 1>the hell out and things can tilt very,</v>

82
00:02:46.421 --> 00:02:47.260
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly.</v>

83
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.791
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

84
00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:48.401
<v Speaker 1>all you have to do,</v>

85
00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:52.060
<v Speaker 1>look at what happened in World War one new unexpected that it was like one,</v>

86
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.100
<v Speaker 1>one relatively minor member,</v>

87
00:02:57.101 --> 00:02:58.450
<v Speaker 1>I think of the aristocracy,</v>

88
00:02:58.451 --> 00:03:02.830
<v Speaker 1>if I remember was assassinated in one minor little country.</v>

89
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.150
<v Speaker 1>It's like bang,</v>

90
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:05.980
<v Speaker 1>everything fell apart.</v>

91
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.660
<v Speaker 1>And that's positive feedback loops,</v>

92
00:03:07.661 --> 00:03:08.470
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

93
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.650
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what we're in right now and we've got to be,</v>

94
00:03:10.651 --> 00:03:12.670
<v Speaker 1>and that's a really chaotic time.</v>

95
00:03:12.671 --> 00:03:17.671
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say maintain self control and don't aim to win.</v>

96
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.510
<v Speaker 1>Amen.</v>

97
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.343
<v Speaker 1>Peace.</v>

98
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:21.581
<v Speaker 1>Because winning,</v>

99
00:03:21.581 --> 00:03:21.980
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

100
00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.110
<v Speaker 1>that's not peace.</v>

101
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.790
<v Speaker 1>It's better to aim for peace.</v>

102
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

103
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.430
<v Speaker 1>I've got this talk coming up in November 11th I'm quite worried about it because</v>

104
00:03:30.431 --> 00:03:33.430
<v Speaker 1>I know there's going to be protesters there and that they've been emboldened by</v>

105
00:03:33.431 --> 00:03:37.240
<v Speaker 1>the fact that they shut the torque down before and I want to make a video I'll</v>

106
00:03:37.241 --> 00:03:41.380
<v Speaker 1>probably do tomorrow telling everyone that comes to that meeting to like watch</v>

107
00:03:41.381 --> 00:03:46.381
<v Speaker 1>their bloody step and stay out of the gutter because you just,</v>

108
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.720
<v Speaker 1>we're at,</v>

109
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.500
<v Speaker 1>we're at,</v>

110
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.980
<v Speaker 1>we're at a point now where under the wrong circumstances,</v>

111
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.740
<v Speaker 1>if the wrong person does the wrong thing,</v>

112
00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.440
<v Speaker 1>that the consequences will be very great.</v>

113
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.470
<v Speaker 1>Now we can't predict which action is going to precipitate that and or even if</v>

114
00:04:06.101 --> 00:04:07.210
<v Speaker 1>that will happen,</v>

115
00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.660
<v Speaker 1>but it's chaotic enough so that it could happen.</v>

116
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:12.220
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

117
00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.560
<v Speaker 1>also govern yourselves accordingly.</v>

118
00:04:14.561 --> 00:04:18.280
<v Speaker 1>Now the problem is is that there are people who would be happy if there was</v>

119
00:04:18.281 --> 00:04:19.570
<v Speaker 1>blood running in the street.</v>

120
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.960
<v Speaker 1>They're the same sort of people that shoot up high schools or kill innocent,</v>

121
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.531
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

122
00:04:23.531 --> 00:04:27.760
<v Speaker 1>elementary school kids just to show what they're made of and what they believe.</v>

123
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.110
<v Speaker 1>And that's a big problem.</v>

124
00:04:29.111 --> 00:04:30.490
<v Speaker 1>But for the rest of us,</v>

125
00:04:30.491 --> 00:04:32.530
<v Speaker 1>like hopefully calmer heads can prevail.</v>

126
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.080
<v Speaker 1>And so it really is important not to win.</v>

127
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.110
<v Speaker 1>It's like fighting with your wife.</v>

128
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:39.730
<v Speaker 1>You don't win.</v>

129
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.510
<v Speaker 1>You can't because you have to live with her because you can't win.</v>

130
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.140
<v Speaker 1>But maybe you can solve the problem and bring about peace.</v>

131
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.770
<v Speaker 1>And so you've got a practice doing that practice restraint.</v>

132
00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.180
<v Speaker 1>And remember too that these people that you're talking about who had radical</v>

133
00:04:55.181 --> 00:04:56.740
<v Speaker 1>leftists is most of the time,</v>

134
00:04:56.741 --> 00:05:00.850
<v Speaker 1>they're not like they're 95% like you.</v>

135
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.470
<v Speaker 1>And if you pull them out of the mob,</v>

136
00:05:02.471 --> 00:05:04.360
<v Speaker 1>they're just like your,</v>

137
00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.860
<v Speaker 1>your neighbor's 19 year old kid who's kind of clueless and rebellious.</v>

138
00:05:08.861 --> 00:05:09.310
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

139
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.700
<v Speaker 1>And who you might even like you put them in the mob.</v>

140
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:13.750
<v Speaker 1>It's a whole different thing.</v>

141
00:05:13.751 --> 00:05:15.690
<v Speaker 1>And so you got to remember that too.</v>

142
00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.970
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

143
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.290
<v Speaker 1>the fear of social isolation,</v>

144
00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.470
<v Speaker 1>you say no,</v>

145
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.080
<v Speaker 1>it's just that they're possessed by these ideas,</v>

146
00:05:23.081 --> 00:05:23.410
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

147
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:24.880
<v Speaker 1>but only partially,</v>

148
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.923
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

149
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.900
<v Speaker 1>you hardly find it full blooded.</v>

150
00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.470
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely committed radical leftist activist.</v>

151
00:05:32.471 --> 00:05:32.711
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

152
00:05:32.711 --> 00:05:33.640
<v Speaker 1>like there are some,</v>

153
00:05:33.641 --> 00:05:34.451
<v Speaker 1>but not very many.</v>

154
00:05:34.451 --> 00:05:34.931
<v Speaker 1>Most of it.</v>

155
00:05:34.931 --> 00:05:37.630
<v Speaker 1>It's just fragmentary behavior.</v>

156
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.100
<v Speaker 1>And you have to remember that like when the students come out to protest me,</v>

157
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.891
<v Speaker 1>it was a case,</v>

158
00:05:41.891 --> 00:05:43.310
<v Speaker 1>particularly at McMaster,</v>

159
00:05:43.311 --> 00:05:47.260
<v Speaker 1>I have to remember these kids,</v>

160
00:05:47.261 --> 00:05:49.330
<v Speaker 1>they're not much different than my kids.</v>

161
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.650
<v Speaker 1>They are when they're in a stupid mob behind a hammer and sickle flag,</v>

162
00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.281
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

163
00:05:54.281 --> 00:05:54.850
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

164
00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:55.180
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

165
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.013
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

166
00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.290
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to make a low resolution,</v>

167
00:06:00.291 --> 00:06:02.450
<v Speaker 1>homogenous representation of them.</v>

168
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:04.340
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

169
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:05.473
<v Speaker 1>and so you,</v>

170
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:06.530
<v Speaker 1>that's why again,</v>

171
00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:07.670
<v Speaker 1>I think instead of winning,</v>

172
00:06:07.671 --> 00:06:09.530
<v Speaker 1>you turn to your own development.</v>

173
00:06:09.531 --> 00:06:10.850
<v Speaker 1>You turn to your own development,</v>

174
00:06:10.851 --> 00:06:14.960
<v Speaker 1>you do what you can to stop doing the things that you're doing that aren't good</v>

175
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:16.640
<v Speaker 1>because you're not going to hurt anybody.</v>

176
00:06:16.641 --> 00:06:17.271
<v Speaker 1>If you do that,</v>

177
00:06:17.271 --> 00:06:18.470
<v Speaker 1>all you're going to do is help.</v>

178
00:06:18.471 --> 00:06:21.650
<v Speaker 1>And otherwise you'll participate in this polarization.</v>

179
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.400
<v Speaker 1>And that's unless you want that.</v>

180
00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:26.151
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

181
00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:30.380
<v Speaker 1>there's a dark part of people that it's part of the part that voted for Trump</v>

182
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.360
<v Speaker 1>would like to burn things to the ground.</v>

183
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:33.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like to help,</v>

184
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.780
<v Speaker 1>I know how people felt when they went into the voting booth.</v>

185
00:06:35.781 --> 00:06:36.860
<v Speaker 1>It was like Hillary,</v>

186
00:06:36.861 --> 00:06:37.970
<v Speaker 1>Hillary dealt with it.</v>

187
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:38.803
<v Speaker 1>Trump,</v>

188
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.201
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

189
00:06:39.201 --> 00:06:39.920
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

190
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.960
<v Speaker 1>that's a hell of a thing to say to hell with it,</v>

191
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.070
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

192
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.640
<v Speaker 1>Although I could,</v>

193
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.800
<v Speaker 1>I could certainly understand that sentiment.</v>

194
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.040
<v Speaker 1>So we have to be careful.</v>

195
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:51.140
<v Speaker 1>And all of you people who are here,</v>

196
00:06:51.141 --> 00:06:56.141
<v Speaker 1>who are advocates of free speech and who are theoretically happy to come hear me</v>

197
00:06:57.051 --> 00:06:57.501
<v Speaker 1>speak,</v>

198
00:06:57.501 --> 00:06:57.831
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

199
00:06:57.831 --> 00:06:58.800
<v Speaker 1>I really do believe it.</v>

200
00:06:58.801 --> 00:06:59.810
<v Speaker 1>I truly believe this.</v>

201
00:06:59.811 --> 00:07:02.850
<v Speaker 1>And this is something I learned in part from social knits and in part from you.</v>

202
00:07:02.851 --> 00:07:07.851
<v Speaker 1>I missed that the way that you set the world straight is by constraining the</v>

203
00:07:08.061 --> 00:07:09.710
<v Speaker 1>malevolence in your own heart.</v>

204
00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.060
<v Speaker 1>And that's no joke,</v>

205
00:07:11.061 --> 00:07:11.331
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

206
00:07:11.331 --> 00:07:12.470
<v Speaker 1>That's no easy thing.</v>

207
00:07:12.471 --> 00:07:16.760
<v Speaker 1>And that's a good voyage for people to go on if they want something difficult</v>

208
00:07:16.761 --> 00:07:17.750
<v Speaker 1>and worthwhile to do.</v>

209
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:18.410
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
