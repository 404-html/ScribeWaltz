00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.310
<v Speaker 1>Who's the bird headed god of Egypt,</v>

2
00:00:09.311 --> 00:00:09.941
<v Speaker 1>who I told you about,</v>

3
00:00:09.941 --> 00:00:12.400
<v Speaker 1>who represents the capacity to pay attention.</v>

4
00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.500
<v Speaker 1>Very important concept because the Egyptians realized and really it's brilliant.</v>

5
00:00:17.501 --> 00:00:20.800
<v Speaker 1>It is something modern people do not understand cause we tend to make</v>

6
00:00:20.801 --> 00:00:23.170
<v Speaker 1>rationality the highest God that's,</v>

7
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.580
<v Speaker 1>that's not a good thing.</v>

8
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.500
<v Speaker 1>That's a pathway to totalitarianism.</v>

9
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.540
<v Speaker 1>What the Egyptians knew,</v>

10
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.770
<v Speaker 1>but they only knew it in symbolic form was it was the capacity to attend to</v>

11
00:00:32.771 --> 00:00:37.030
<v Speaker 1>things that in some sense was the highest psychological function because it's</v>

12
00:00:37.031 --> 00:00:40.900
<v Speaker 1>the capacity to pay attention that actually moves you beyond what you only know.</v>

13
00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.330
<v Speaker 1>And rationality tends to make,</v>

14
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.631
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:00:43.631 --> 00:00:45.520
<v Speaker 1>integral systems that are coherent,</v>

16
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.150
<v Speaker 1>that are boxlike and then claim that they're absolutely right.</v>

17
00:00:49.151 --> 00:00:52.390
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the tension is always looking beyond what you know.</v>

18
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:53.200
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

19
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.960
<v Speaker 1>and attention is an unbelievably powerful force.</v>

20
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.273
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

21
00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:58.990
<v Speaker 1>that's why advertisers pay for it.</v>

22
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.760
<v Speaker 1>That's why people demand it.</v>

23
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.650
<v Speaker 1>That's why children can't live without it.</v>

24
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.290
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's what you want from your friends and your family.</v>

25
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.420
<v Speaker 1>You want them to pay attention to you.</v>

26
00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.670
<v Speaker 1>It's an unbelievably valuable resource.</v>

27
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.490
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things I always tell my clients,</v>

28
00:01:12.491 --> 00:01:13.031
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

29
00:01:13.031 --> 00:01:14.260
<v Speaker 1>if they're socially anxious,</v>

30
00:01:14.261 --> 00:01:14.501
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>

31
00:01:14.501 --> 00:01:15.334
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

32
00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.000
<v Speaker 1>pay more attention to the person you're talking to.</v>

33
00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.170
<v Speaker 1>If you pay,</v>

34
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.420
<v Speaker 1>if you really pay close attention to them,</v>

35
00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.360
<v Speaker 1>then the thoughts that are making you anxious will be suppressed.</v>

36
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.670
<v Speaker 1>And because you're paying close attention to them,</v>

37
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.780
<v Speaker 1>you'll match your movements to theirs and you'll match your conversation to</v>

38
00:01:31.781 --> 00:01:32.290
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

39
00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.900
<v Speaker 1>And then there's no reason for you to be socially anxious cause socially</v>

40
00:01:34.901 --> 00:01:35.231
<v Speaker 1>anxious.</v>

41
00:01:35.231 --> 00:01:36.940
<v Speaker 1>People will go like this when they're talking,</v>

42
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.331
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:01:37.331 --> 00:01:39.190
<v Speaker 1>they don't want look at you of course,</v>

44
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.120
<v Speaker 1>how the hell can you engage anyone if you're not in a little dance with them,</v>

45
00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.291
<v Speaker 1>you know you can't.</v>

46
00:01:44.291 --> 00:01:45.760
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of it's non verbal,</v>

47
00:01:45.761 --> 00:01:50.710
<v Speaker 1>it's physical and it's embodied and without paying attention then you lose</v>

48
00:01:50.711 --> 00:01:51.071
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

49
00:01:51.071 --> 00:01:53.200
<v Speaker 1>And you see this with speakers all the time too.</v>

50
00:01:53.201 --> 00:01:54.400
<v Speaker 1>There in front of audiences,</v>

51
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.710
<v Speaker 1>they have their paper and they're going like this.</v>

52
00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.840
<v Speaker 1>And usually they're talking like this too.</v>

53
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.430
<v Speaker 1>And you know the logical thing to do in that case is like look at Facebook or</v>

54
00:02:03.431 --> 00:02:05.020
<v Speaker 1>get the hell out of there something.</v>

55
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.750
<v Speaker 1>But they're not paying attention to the audience,</v>

56
00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.550
<v Speaker 1>and so there's no power in the,</v>

57
00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.670
<v Speaker 1>there's no power in the dynamic conversation at all.</v>
