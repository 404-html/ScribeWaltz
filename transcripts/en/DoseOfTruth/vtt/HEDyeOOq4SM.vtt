<v Speaker 2>us better than him</v>

21
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.330
<v Speaker 2>and usually when is being introduced</v>

22
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.420
<v Speaker 2>to a speed.</v>

23
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.890
<v Speaker 2>Now of course you've all come there because</v>

24
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:14.773
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>

25
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.120
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to do a different thing because I think it has thomas you more</v>

26
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.290
<v Speaker 2>deeply something about what is going on with his job.</v>

27
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.810
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to read you a few things that are wrong about.</v>

28
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.260
<v Speaker 2>So these are actual things that are often media,</v>

29
00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.130
<v Speaker 2>character assassination and there has been one each day just about for a long</v>

30
00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.143
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

31
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.990
<v Speaker 2>So is the times if he wants to force young women marriage,</v>

32
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.160
<v Speaker 2>these people</v>

33
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.830
<v Speaker 2>actually not that bad.</v>

34
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.410
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

35
00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.993
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

36
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.060
<v Speaker 2>and that's the reason they say that they want you to become a grade</v>

37
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:21.550
<v Speaker 2>level group.</v>

38
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:22.443
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

39
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.063
<v Speaker 2>Of these</v>

40
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.940
<v Speaker 2>conservative reform listing with.</v>

41
00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:31.720
<v Speaker 2>So that's another one,</v>

42
00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:32.623
<v Speaker 2>the directors that</v>

43
00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.850
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

44
00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:35.683
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

45
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm one of you as well as I go,</v>

46
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.350
<v Speaker 2>a coral is</v>

47
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:43.061
<v Speaker 2>formed,</v>

48
00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:44.110
<v Speaker 2>is preferable</v>

49
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.460
<v Speaker 2>to say he's a scientists.</v>

50
00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.040
<v Speaker 2>We encourage these young men to see themselves as he's a mash up of delivers a</v>

51
00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.670
<v Speaker 2>Mashup of hits.</v>

52
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.840
<v Speaker 2>And my first book of myths,</v>

53
00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.430
<v Speaker 2>we seems like a terrible therapist is in fact political and social thinker,</v>

54
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.670
<v Speaker 2>an angry white guy,</v>

55
00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.910
<v Speaker 2>authoritarianism and Richard Spencer is that system isn't</v>

56
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.871
<v Speaker 2>used to do,</v>

57
00:04:28.871 --> 00:04:29.800
<v Speaker 2>is chill.</v>

58
00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.960
<v Speaker 2>He's attached with Mrs. This is just a small sample</v>

59
00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.190
<v Speaker 2>and it's all wrong for have,</v>

60
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

61
00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.240
<v Speaker 2>decided to go home and shield.</v>

62
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.490
<v Speaker 2>It's all wrong</v>

63
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.600
<v Speaker 2>and you want every day to miss informed people about that.</v>

64
00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.100
<v Speaker 2>And you can demonstrate demonstratively false.</v>

65
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:04.503
<v Speaker 2>I would.</v>

66
00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:12.450
<v Speaker 2>There are some people that see him as a risk to their agenda and their work with</v>

67
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.170
<v Speaker 2>you for some reason.</v>

68
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.550
<v Speaker 2>That is a reasonable balance,</v>

69
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:19.400
<v Speaker 2>walter,</v>

70
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.630
<v Speaker 2>with fruitful.</v>

71
00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.380
<v Speaker 2>And I've never seen such a campaign against any thing ever in the world.</v>

72
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:27.170
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

73
00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:30.340
<v Speaker 2>not even some of them is untruthful or ask.</v>

74
00:05:30.341 --> 00:05:32.770
<v Speaker 2>This is thing is.</v>

75
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.250
<v Speaker 2>So this tells you something,</v>

76
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:37.143
<v Speaker 2>this</v>

77
00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:43.330
<v Speaker 2>tells you something about this importance of his message and I'm not gonna,</v>

78
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.250
<v Speaker 2>not gonna theorize about exactly what that is,</v>

79
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:54.150
<v Speaker 2>because there are lots of theories about exactly what it is in what you say</v>

80
00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.893
<v Speaker 2>breakfast</v>

81
00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:58.783
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

82
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.883
<v Speaker 3>actually</v>

83
00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:08.450
<v Speaker 3>let's just listen to you and you have to figure out what happened.</v>

84
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:16.310
<v Speaker 3>So please give a warm welcome,</v>

85
00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.670
<v Speaker 3>not be</v>

86
00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:13.800
<v Speaker 3>thinking the other room</v>

87
00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:18.973
<v Speaker 3>numbers</v>

88
00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:27.020
<v Speaker 3>that there isn't anything more where your issue is issue,</v>

89
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:38.350
<v Speaker 3>then we're discovering numbers that</v>

90
00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:42.293
<v Speaker 3>power</v>

91
00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:45.813
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

92
00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.290
<v Speaker 3>the claim numbers are</v>

93
00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:51.773
<v Speaker 3>reading</v>

94
00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:59.380
<v Speaker 3>to utilize them and your ability to operate in the world expands</v>

95
00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.880
<v Speaker 3>when you use it.</v>

96
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:15.200
<v Speaker 3>The facilitator use of operating the world.</v>

97
00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:20.570
<v Speaker 3>Interesting lead numbers are abstractions.</v>

98
00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:23.570
<v Speaker 3>And so that raises another question.</v>

99
00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:26.463
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

100
00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:29.340
<v Speaker 4>what's more real?</v>

101
00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:33.223
<v Speaker 1>The</v>

102
00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:37.593
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

103
00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:42.500
<v Speaker 3>and maybe the question for me,</v>

104
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:49.500
<v Speaker 3>but it's not obvious that abstractions aren't real strong on anything else.</v>

105
00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:53.730
<v Speaker 3>And so then you might ask yourself,</v>

106
00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.370
<v Speaker 3>well then one of the most real</v>

107
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:57.360
<v Speaker 5>abstractions</v>

108
00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:00.063
<v Speaker 5>start</v>

109
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:02.183
<v Speaker 5>tonight.</v>

110
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:06.530
<v Speaker 5>We're going to talk about in relationship with as many rules as I can.</v>

111
00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:11.163
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

112
00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.400
<v Speaker 5>those were the rules.</v>

113
00:09:13.401 --> 00:09:14.234
<v Speaker 5>First</v>

114
00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.540
<v Speaker 5>is stand up straight.</v>

115
00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:18.210
<v Speaker 5>Shoulders.</v>

116
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:19.043
<v Speaker 5>Back</v>

117
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:25.220
<v Speaker 5>to is treat yourself like you're someone responsible for</v>

118
00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:28.431
<v Speaker 5>number three,</v>

119
00:09:28.431 --> 00:09:30.930
<v Speaker 5>which is very tightly associated with</v>

120
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:32.910
<v Speaker 5>me,</v>

121
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:35.210
<v Speaker 5>is making friends with those people.</v>

122
00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:38.790
<v Speaker 5>By the way,</v>

123
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:42.810
<v Speaker 5>these rules aren't designed to make your life easier.</v>

124
00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:50.990
<v Speaker 5>His whole life.</v>

125
00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.570
<v Speaker 5>Everything was seeding,</v>

126
00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:55.843
<v Speaker 5>easily</v>

127
00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:59.670
<v Speaker 5>cry out</v>

128
00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:04.523
<v Speaker 5>world</v>

129
00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:11.160
<v Speaker 5>as a universal benefactor that we would strive to do nothing other than to make</v>

130
00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.490
<v Speaker 5>life more difficult for</v>

131
00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:22.120
<v Speaker 5>someone to respond to me is the same as the nice to so it's not associated</v>

132
00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:29.760
<v Speaker 5>with the best</v>

133
00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:36.880
<v Speaker 5>for is you hear yourself yesterday</v>

134
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:40.730
<v Speaker 5>and that's Johnson.</v>

135
00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:43.773
<v Speaker 5>That's easy.</v>

136
00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:44.963
<v Speaker 5>You need,</v>

137
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:47.110
<v Speaker 5>you need things that are</v>

138
00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:50.323
<v Speaker 5>worthwhile,</v>

139
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:54.180
<v Speaker 5>but that is</v>

140
00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:58.153
<v Speaker 5>more.</v>

141
00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.490
<v Speaker 5>It is deserved.</v>

142
00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:02.200
<v Speaker 5>We're undeserving manner,</v>

143
00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:09.340
<v Speaker 5>so as the target for improvement</v>

144
00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:17.110
<v Speaker 5>and the rule of thumb there is if you dislike them,</v>

145
00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:18.003
<v Speaker 5>that</v>

146
00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:20.920
<v Speaker 5>is a bad idea.</v>

147
00:11:20.921 --> 00:11:25.921
<v Speaker 5>To allow their children to act in a way that makes other children is like the or</v>

148
00:11:25.981 --> 00:11:30.730
<v Speaker 5>adult is like they're going to have to deal with children and you're going to</v>

149
00:11:30.731 --> 00:11:32.250
<v Speaker 5>have to be so.</v>

150
00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:37.370
<v Speaker 5>Your primary responsibility is to how have your job or not behave so that the</v>

151
00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:43.090
<v Speaker 5>world opens up its arms and well</v>

152
00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:47.350
<v Speaker 5>managed.</v>

153
00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:51.680
<v Speaker 5>That it's not a simple thing to do is protect your house,</v>

154
00:11:51.681 --> 00:11:56.681
<v Speaker 5>is the perfect word in world and not take no action until you have activator.</v>

155
00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:06.620
<v Speaker 5>We use that line,</v>

156
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:11.790
<v Speaker 5>your ambition and work on what's right in front of you that you will suffer for</v>

157
00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:14.400
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

158
00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:19.400
<v Speaker 5>You didn't roll the large scale transformation of other people.</v>

159
00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:24.230
<v Speaker 5>Seven is meaningful,</v>

160
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:30.110
<v Speaker 5>not scream and rant would say in some sense some sense that's</v>

161
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:40.590
<v Speaker 5>not telling the truth or at least necessary junkies necessary additional because</v>

162
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:47.200
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that you can pursue what is meaningful,</v>

163
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:52.750
<v Speaker 5>the truth and the reason for that is let's say why you corrupt the mechanisms,</v>

164
00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:58.300
<v Speaker 5>mechanisms that</v>

165
00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:03.430
<v Speaker 5>manifested itself meaning and then you can trust them.</v>

166
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:05.770
<v Speaker 5>That's a very bad idea,</v>

167
00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:09.730
<v Speaker 5>so the fundamental reasons to not live</v>

168
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:16.990
<v Speaker 5>and when you grew up in rely on yourself and if</v>

169
00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:23.830
<v Speaker 5>you lie on the absence of rule justin,</v>

170
00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:26.260
<v Speaker 5>but nothing,</v>

171
00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:29.123
<v Speaker 5>you be</v>

172
00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:32.963
<v Speaker 3>just</v>

173
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:33.833
<v Speaker 5>that was it</v>

174
00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:36.840
<v Speaker 5>than</v>

175
00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:39.740
<v Speaker 5>the person that you're listening to.</v>

176
00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:44.980
<v Speaker 5>Something that's not so much respect for the person that is a mark of</v>

177
00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:50.000
<v Speaker 5>recognition of your own unbearable maintenance.</v>

178
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:50.930
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

179
00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:54.270
<v Speaker 5>one of the things you have to do is decide whether</v>

180
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:56.183
<v Speaker 3>more</v>

181
00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:58.670
<v Speaker 5>you have to make sense</v>

182
00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:00.203
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>

183
00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:06.590
<v Speaker 5>You have to decide what's more important.</v>

184
00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:10.101
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>

185
00:14:10.101 --> 00:14:15.101
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of what you know and so if you restraints with that because that's</v>

186
00:14:15.711 --> 00:14:16.544
<v Speaker 5>important,</v>

187
00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:20.610
<v Speaker 5>well that's a good thing because you're going to be surrounded by your entire</v>

188
00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:21.453
<v Speaker 5>life.</v>

189
00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:23.330
<v Speaker 5>If you were appreciative of that,</v>

190
00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:25.370
<v Speaker 5>absolutely make things better,</v>

191
00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:27.023
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

192
00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.840
<v Speaker 5>the other element of that is,</v>

193
00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:30.980
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

194
00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:34.980
<v Speaker 5>why should you be appreciated as well?</v>

195
00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:35.980
<v Speaker 5>You shouldn't be.</v>

196
00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:38.480
<v Speaker 5>Your life is absolutely perfect in every way.</v>

197
00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:40.970
<v Speaker 5>You have exactly what you needed.</v>

198
00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:45.380
<v Speaker 5>One get ordered around in what you do is sufficient,</v>

199
00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:50.290
<v Speaker 5>but if you believe that things can still be right around you,</v>

200
00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:51.463
<v Speaker 5>your own</v>

201
00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:54.760
<v Speaker 5>with regards to the effect you have another people,</v>

202
00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:58.700
<v Speaker 5>it obviously wasn't built yet and it was more important than what you do know</v>

203
00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:03.760
<v Speaker 5>and you should be paying us and find out at every possible moment and if you're</v>

204
00:15:04.401 --> 00:15:06.590
<v Speaker 5>fortunate when you have a conversation with someone,</v>

205
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:10.420
<v Speaker 5>actually interested in what they say they haven't.</v>

206
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:14.870
<v Speaker 5>Even if they're not very good at communicating initiatives or awkward or even if</v>

207
00:15:14.871 --> 00:15:19.340
<v Speaker 5>they display a certain amount of energy towards you is always the possibility</v>

208
00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:22.040
<v Speaker 5>that they might tell you something you don't know,</v>

209
00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:24.590
<v Speaker 5>in which case you could walk away from the conversation,</v>

210
00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:29.800
<v Speaker 5>less ignorant and then it were when you started the conversation and if you</v>

211
00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:30.810
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

212
00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:35.810
<v Speaker 5>isn't everything that you would like it to be the slightly less important and is</v>

213
00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:40.320
<v Speaker 5>probably the thing and so ruth Pennington,</v>

214
00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:45.340
<v Speaker 5>be precise and speak from that's in there and say that that's a barrier of a New</v>

215
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:50.140
<v Speaker 5>Testament in council,</v>

216
00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:55.140
<v Speaker 5>which is a description of the nature of the world which is not being asked to</v>

217
00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:01.310
<v Speaker 5>receive is very stringent theory,</v>

218
00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:02.473
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>

219
00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:07.630
<v Speaker 5>but I would say is far more in accordance with what we know about the psychology</v>

220
00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:08.880
<v Speaker 5>of perceptions,</v>

221
00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:14.190
<v Speaker 5>let's say than you might imagine because it is the case that</v>

222
00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:18.210
<v Speaker 5>you don't get to delegate.</v>

223
00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:19.143
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

224
00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:21.250
<v Speaker 5>Mike,</v>

225
00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:26.250
<v Speaker 5>if you do it in that and might is better as which the center,</v>

226
00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:31.270
<v Speaker 5>if you specify the nature of the.</v>

227
00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:32.621
<v Speaker 5>Actually,</v>

228
00:16:32.621 --> 00:16:37.210
<v Speaker 5>if you specify the nature of the being that you want break into being that he</v>

229
00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:41.350
<v Speaker 5>radically decreases the probability that that's her or she will know that</v>

230
00:16:41.351 --> 00:16:46.351
<v Speaker 5>because you regard yourself at least to some degree as active creative agents,</v>

231
00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:53.160
<v Speaker 5>fundamental attitude towards itself isn't afterwards is that you will have a</v>

232
00:16:57.551 --> 00:17:02.050
<v Speaker 5>landscape of possibilities that leave themselves open to you and you make</v>

233
00:17:02.051 --> 00:17:02.884
<v Speaker 5>choices.</v>

234
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:08.030
<v Speaker 5>The three no's and determined in consequence how the world is going to manifest</v>

235
00:17:08.471 --> 00:17:13.471
<v Speaker 5>itself in a field of potential concern of your choices do determine which</v>

236
00:17:15.791 --> 00:17:20.791
<v Speaker 5>elements of that are going to concretize them self into the real world are very</v>

237
00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:25.550
<v Speaker 5>unhappy with yourself.</v>

238
00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:28.960
<v Speaker 5>People will do a property and you're very unhappy with other people.</v>

239
00:17:28.961 --> 00:17:30.510
<v Speaker 5>If they don't do that property,</v>

240
00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:32.200
<v Speaker 5>you're going to have other people.</v>

241
00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.980
<v Speaker 5>If they don't treat you like that's what your life,</v>

242
00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:39.460
<v Speaker 5>because part of what you demand for people,</v>

243
00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:41.920
<v Speaker 5>let's say in terms of sheer civility,</v>

244
00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:43.930
<v Speaker 5>is that they act towards you lose.</v>

245
00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:49.170
<v Speaker 5>If you're the locus of voluntary choice in the world and your brave each other</v>

246
00:17:49.351 --> 00:17:49.790
<v Speaker 5>for that.</v>

247
00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:52.890
<v Speaker 5>As children and parents,</v>

248
00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:53.840
<v Speaker 5>your parents would say,</v>

249
00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:54.990
<v Speaker 5>if you're fortunate,</v>

250
00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.120
<v Speaker 5>you're not living up to your potential,</v>

251
00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:00.180
<v Speaker 5>which is actually a compliment in a sense,</v>

252
00:18:00.181 --> 00:18:05.181
<v Speaker 5>even though it's also a judgment and the problem is I know perfectly well that</v>

253
00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:10.180
<v Speaker 5>you can be more than you are and you'll pay your bills done every single thing</v>

254
00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:13.500
<v Speaker 5>like he thinks in relationship to your own conscience that yes,</v>

255
00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:17.370
<v Speaker 5>I have a lot of brokers that are not fully realizing and that actually</v>

256
00:18:17.371 --> 00:18:20.370
<v Speaker 5>constitutes state transgression against the group.</v>

257
00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:21.800
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>

258
00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:26.800
<v Speaker 5>I don't think I've ever met anyone who doesn't believe that if you have</v>

259
00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:32.450
<v Speaker 5>reasonable conversations to seems self evident now and then you need someone</v>

260
00:18:33.541 --> 00:18:35.040
<v Speaker 5>who's a narcissistic itself,</v>

261
00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:35.790
<v Speaker 5>satisfying,</v>

262
00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:37.710
<v Speaker 5>but then they're narcissistic.</v>

263
00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:41.120
<v Speaker 5>That's not good at that as a medium to low third strategy.</v>

264
00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:43.520
<v Speaker 5>That's a disaster.</v>

265
00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:44.410
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

266
00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:46.050
<v Speaker 5>It's a short term protecting.</v>

267
00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:47.453
<v Speaker 5>Moreover,</v>

268
00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:49.740
<v Speaker 5>it's not the least.</v>

269
00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:50.060
<v Speaker 5>Of course,</v>

270
00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:51.480
<v Speaker 5>other things as well.</v>

271
00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:52.811
<v Speaker 5>Rule 11,</v>

272
00:18:52.811 --> 00:18:57.811
<v Speaker 5>there's no father children in their state board and that's the discussion is</v>

273
00:18:58.350 --> 00:18:59.090
<v Speaker 5>courage,</v>

274
00:18:59.090 --> 00:18:59.923
<v Speaker 5>encouragement,</v>

275
00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:03.990
<v Speaker 5>workforce specifically because I the standard,</v>

276
00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:04.873
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

277
00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:08.450
<v Speaker 5>what role parents play in the lives of their children.</v>

278
00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:13.520
<v Speaker 5>I would say this is a little bit that is a fundamental importance as well as a</v>

279
00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:19.730
<v Speaker 5>family to your children so that they act in a socially desirable manner so the</v>

280
00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:22.260
<v Speaker 5>world opens itself up to them.</v>

281
00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:24.990
<v Speaker 5>You also want to encourage them,</v>

282
00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:27.210
<v Speaker 5>which is not the same as sheltering them.</v>

283
00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:29.280
<v Speaker 5>It's not the same at all.</v>

284
00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:32.250
<v Speaker 5>And to encourage the audience to say something like,</v>

285
00:19:32.251 --> 00:19:33.070
<v Speaker 5>look accurate,</v>

286
00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:34.770
<v Speaker 5>something like your kid</v>

287
00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:37.470
<v Speaker 5>as you.</v>

288
00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:38.970
<v Speaker 5>The world is already difficult.</v>

289
00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:44.700
<v Speaker 5>It's even difficult or you're not the same.</v>

290
00:19:44.701 --> 00:19:46.230
<v Speaker 5>Their child's size difficulties,</v>

291
00:19:46.231 --> 00:19:47.500
<v Speaker 5>but they're still different.</v>

292
00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:53.440
<v Speaker 5>Role is a very hard place and it's a better place and it's not only a hard</v>

293
00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:55.920
<v Speaker 5>interface.</v>

294
00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:00.920
<v Speaker 5>It's also tested the trailer and that's the fundamental bottom line,</v>

295
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:06.590
<v Speaker 5>but there's something in you that is capable of taking that on and transcending</v>

296
00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:11.300
<v Speaker 5>and that's encouragement.</v>

297
00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:12.061
<v Speaker 5>You'd say,</v>

298
00:20:12.061 --> 00:20:12.894
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

299
00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:15.030
<v Speaker 5>as difficult as things are,</v>

300
00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:20.680
<v Speaker 5>you are often the children and with children when you're doing that,</v>

301
00:20:23.581 --> 00:20:26.430
<v Speaker 5>say in advisedly dangerous things,</v>

302
00:20:26.431 --> 00:20:31.431
<v Speaker 5>which of course knew if their state border to interfere with that is to</v>

303
00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:36.890
<v Speaker 5>interfere with the child's willingness to voluntarily expose themselves to the</v>

304
00:20:37.801 --> 00:20:42.801
<v Speaker 5>risks that they need to expose themselves to in order to develop the competence</v>

305
00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:45.860
<v Speaker 5>that allows them to thrive,</v>

306
00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:47.210
<v Speaker 5>to grow the account,</v>

307
00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:48.520
<v Speaker 5>sheltered from</v>

308
00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:55.520
<v Speaker 5>interfere with children when they're taking the necessary risks is not love.</v>

309
00:20:55.910 --> 00:21:00.910
<v Speaker 5>We're infinitely powerful is our parents and it's deeply down into children and</v>

310
00:21:01.601 --> 00:21:06.601
<v Speaker 5>I can tell you that I've never had a client come to my office and all the</v>

311
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:09.063
<v Speaker 5>hundreds,</v>

312
00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:13.060
<v Speaker 5>all hundreds of encounters have people in my office.</v>

313
00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:15.070
<v Speaker 5>I've never had a client say,</v>

314
00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:17.870
<v Speaker 5>my parents need me to be independent.</v>

315
00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:23.510
<v Speaker 5>That hasn't happened with one right now.</v>

316
00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:29.040
<v Speaker 5>My parents need me to dependent or life conspired with my parents to</v>

317
00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:30.653
<v Speaker 5>perpetually.</v>

318
00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:34.090
<v Speaker 5>That happened all the time.</v>

319
00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:39.740
<v Speaker 5>So here's a rule of thumb that I think is a good word is often applied to</v>

320
00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:42.490
<v Speaker 5>nursing homes by people who work at your</v>

321
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:44.903
<v Speaker 5>job.</v>

322
00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:46.150
<v Speaker 5>And the rule is,</v>

323
00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:51.190
<v Speaker 5>do not do anything for anyone they can do for themselves and the reason for that</v>

324
00:21:51.191 --> 00:21:53.040
<v Speaker 5>extended support that</v>

325
00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:55.151
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>

326
00:21:55.151 --> 00:21:59.620
<v Speaker 5>if you do something and facilitates the movement forward,</v>

327
00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:02.510
<v Speaker 5>then they move forward because you help</v>

328
00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:08.520
<v Speaker 5>people as therapists that advice</v>

329
00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:12.270
<v Speaker 5>it might fail in the shape they are.</v>

330
00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.020
<v Speaker 5>Rooms paid for my advice,</v>

331
00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:15.131
<v Speaker 5>and second,</v>

332
00:22:15.131 --> 00:22:16.090
<v Speaker 5>if it succeeds,</v>

333
00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:18.970
<v Speaker 5>then I get to be the successful one.</v>

334
00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.700
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to steal the success for my clients.</v>

335
00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:23.170
<v Speaker 5>That's a bad idea.</v>

336
00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:28.380
<v Speaker 5>I want to help them figure out what it is that they should a map and then the</v>

337
00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:30.380
<v Speaker 5>strategy for attaining now.</v>

338
00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:34.870
<v Speaker 5>But I want to ensure that it's their destiny,</v>

339
00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:38.590
<v Speaker 5>not something I'm in a position</v>

340
00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:42.700
<v Speaker 5>I would say therapeutic relationship,</v>

341
00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:46.510
<v Speaker 5>bad relationship here you right?</v>

342
00:22:46.511 --> 00:22:49.290
<v Speaker 5>So one of the things you want to do with your departments,</v>

343
00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:50.020
<v Speaker 5>your spouse,</v>

344
00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:54.850
<v Speaker 5>you say your husband or wife and also children's to listen to them so that you</v>

345
00:22:54.851 --> 00:22:58.870
<v Speaker 5>can figure out what their problems are and figure out which one is going to</v>

346
00:22:58.871 --> 00:23:03.340
<v Speaker 5>figure that out by communicating and then perhaps aid them in the development of</v>

347
00:23:03.341 --> 00:23:04.174
<v Speaker 5>the strategy.</v>

348
00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:09.360
<v Speaker 5>You have to ensure very carefully that you're not imposing your own structure in</v>

349
00:23:11.111 --> 00:23:11.580
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

350
00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:14.890
<v Speaker 5>going to steal from them what's there,</v>

351
00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:20.820
<v Speaker 5>so it's a little evidence current as the fundamental is you can say what's the</v>

352
00:23:23.291 --> 00:23:27.190
<v Speaker 5>antidote to the catastrophe life and what has to be safety.</v>

353
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:33.230
<v Speaker 5>If you're non sensible enough to know that a certain amount of tradition,</v>

354
00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:35.620
<v Speaker 5>the safeties is worthwhile,</v>

355
00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:39.520
<v Speaker 5>you should probably wear your seatbelt when you're driving in your car because</v>

356
00:23:39.521 --> 00:23:41.620
<v Speaker 5>why he foolhardy breath,</v>

357
00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:47.210
<v Speaker 5>but given that there is no security in the final analysis,</v>

358
00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:48.860
<v Speaker 5>then encourage.</v>

359
00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:53.890
<v Speaker 5>There isn't much better medication than sheltering and so and that's that's I</v>

360
00:23:56.841 --> 00:24:01.841
<v Speaker 5>think the eating with the idea that what life is essentially is not a place to</v>

361
00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:08.270
<v Speaker 5>be happy to aim for degree for some front of the wall now to,</v>

362
00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:14.180
<v Speaker 5>but I called to something like adventure and I think that's the proper way of</v>

363
00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.090
<v Speaker 5>conceptualizing it.</v>

364
00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:17.860
<v Speaker 5>Certainly if you go watch a story and move,</v>

365
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:20.040
<v Speaker 5>do you agree to something like that?</v>

366
00:24:20.041 --> 00:24:24.050
<v Speaker 5>If you encounter a narrative that's really literate,</v>

367
00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:28.080
<v Speaker 5>romance or a classic adventure story is the element of this.</v>

368
00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:33.240
<v Speaker 5>It's gripping is the adventure and so portray life is an adventure and romance</v>

369
00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:38.820
<v Speaker 5>and properly and the way that we</v>

370
00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:43.830
<v Speaker 5>facilitate the is to encourage them.</v>

371
00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:46.160
<v Speaker 5>I have a five month already,</v>

372
00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:46.830
<v Speaker 5>liked him,</v>

373
00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:47.670
<v Speaker 5>was a good guy,</v>

374
00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:48.593
<v Speaker 5>smart guy,</v>

375
00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:51.520
<v Speaker 5>good guy and everything.</v>

376
00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:52.480
<v Speaker 5>He was little.</v>

377
00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:54.040
<v Speaker 5>He's a good musician.</v>

378
00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.140
<v Speaker 5>Talented athlete.</v>

379
00:24:58.620 --> 00:24:59.453
<v Speaker 5>Curve</v>

380
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:01.880
<v Speaker 5>will be bundles,</v>

381
00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:03.960
<v Speaker 5>relationship with his girlfriend,</v>

382
00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:07.530
<v Speaker 5>his girlfriend,</v>

383
00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:10.680
<v Speaker 5>the other</v>

384
00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:15.430
<v Speaker 5>gender,</v>

385
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:17.520
<v Speaker 5>and brought the birth parents.</v>

386
00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:23.400
<v Speaker 5>They need every provision profitable to help her prepare for the jury that</v>

387
00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.840
<v Speaker 5>invite the community to make sure she had a great</v>

388
00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:30.030
<v Speaker 5>group and when you talked with his parents,</v>

389
00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:35.060
<v Speaker 5>all he did was worried that he was to her and get her can get her,</v>

390
00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:41.860
<v Speaker 5>but they didn't understand that they were choosing between the hurt,</v>

391
00:25:41.861 --> 00:25:44.860
<v Speaker 5>but you might make to the world and you're having an adventure.</v>

392
00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.320
<v Speaker 5>That's girlfriend.</v>

393
00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:49.470
<v Speaker 5>The hurt that he would encounter by staying at home,</v>

394
00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:51.250
<v Speaker 5>Howard in his basement,</v>

395
00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:54.280
<v Speaker 5>protectionism or lobbying Paris,</v>

396
00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:55.640
<v Speaker 5>last girlfriend.</v>

397
00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:02.910
<v Speaker 5>Which of those two things is more damaging and their answers as his parents</v>

398
00:26:02.911 --> 00:26:05.670
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't worry as much as it was in the basement.</v>

399
00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:07.620
<v Speaker 5>Don't worry,</v>

400
00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:11.840
<v Speaker 5>he's going to be more so I'm</v>

401
00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.210
<v Speaker 5>going to count three,</v>

402
00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:18.220
<v Speaker 5>the NIPSA</v>

403
00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:22.210
<v Speaker 5>meditation on rigidity.</v>

404
00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:28.810
<v Speaker 5>It's a discussion of what we do and what to do and that's really good to that.</v>

405
00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:34.590
<v Speaker 5>Your personal life,</v>

406
00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:36.260
<v Speaker 5>work life,</v>

407
00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:40.520
<v Speaker 5>interview quickly.</v>

408
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.870
<v Speaker 5>It indicates of death in the</v>

409
00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:49.760
<v Speaker 5>lots of degree or any of the things that we have your world outside now close</v>

410
00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:52.250
<v Speaker 5>with a</v>

411
00:26:55.160 --> 00:27:00.160
<v Speaker 5>discussion of necessity of nearly years.</v>

412
00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:09.620
<v Speaker 5>These are more of a control perhaps of the days,</v>

413
00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:11.520
<v Speaker 5>and these are really</v>

414
00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:15.950
<v Speaker 5>our three minutes,</v>

415
00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:18.040
<v Speaker 5>10 minutes.</v>

416
00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:20.103
<v Speaker 5>Can we get</v>

417
00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:24.500
<v Speaker 5>in front of Molly last time that</v>

418
00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:29.900
<v Speaker 5>you do that on your blog,</v>

419
00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:32.160
<v Speaker 5>you're doing not suffering away madly</v>

420
00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:37.560
<v Speaker 5>appreciate everything manifests itself.</v>

421
00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:39.840
<v Speaker 5>That allows itself to be appreciated.</v>

422
00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:48.290
<v Speaker 5>And so that's the 12 rules and I'll return and the street music platform for</v>

423
00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:54.100
<v Speaker 5>laying abstractions.</v>

424
00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:02.210
<v Speaker 5>So some of other with the sense of doubt,</v>

425
00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:04.910
<v Speaker 5>doubt,</v>

426
00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:07.810
<v Speaker 5>doubt is a very extreme word,</v>

427
00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:10.670
<v Speaker 5>easily translatable,</v>

428
00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:11.800
<v Speaker 5>single meaning,</v>

429
00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:13.620
<v Speaker 5>at least in English,</v>

430
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:19.310
<v Speaker 5>it means half of light so that the path as</v>

431
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:24.990
<v Speaker 5>the profit path so that the proper path.</v>

432
00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:28.240
<v Speaker 5>So the idea that as a symbol of reality,</v>

433
00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:31.820
<v Speaker 5>what does it needs to be enlightened?</v>

434
00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:36.830
<v Speaker 5>So there's an implicit idea there that the fundamental reality life is the path</v>

435
00:28:37.291 --> 00:28:40.110
<v Speaker 5>that takes you like it's not a materialist idea,</v>

436
00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:41.290
<v Speaker 5>just different times.</v>

437
00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:46.410
<v Speaker 5>It's the idea that life is more outreaches and we're on a journey,</v>

438
00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:47.690
<v Speaker 5>best reconceptualize.</v>

439
00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:51.320
<v Speaker 5>The reality is the place that you journeyed through,</v>

440
00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:54.390
<v Speaker 5>what are the elements,</v>

441
00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:59.330
<v Speaker 5>what are the constituent elements of the place that you journey through now</v>

442
00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:01.193
<v Speaker 5>that's needed,</v>

443
00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:03.720
<v Speaker 5>and yet in</v>

444
00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:08.273
<v Speaker 5>the world,</v>

445
00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:11.240
<v Speaker 5>the black Blackford again and again,</v>

446
00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:16.700
<v Speaker 5>seven possibly gain from the fact that it's a symbolic representation,</v>

447
00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:20.970
<v Speaker 5>doesn't mean women or men in art.</v>

448
00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:26.680
<v Speaker 5>It's an attempt to use sexual symbolism who represent a deeper underlying</v>

449
00:29:27.241 --> 00:29:32.241
<v Speaker 5>reality is massively in is dark night and there's a light</v>

450
00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:37.320
<v Speaker 5>and the black law license,</v>

451
00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:46.600
<v Speaker 5>one of the other red anymore.</v>

452
00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:49.380
<v Speaker 5>And so that's the new</v>

453
00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:52.970
<v Speaker 5>world.</v>

454
00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:55.350
<v Speaker 5>And the question is perhaps address to use.</v>

455
00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:55.660
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

456
00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:57.610
<v Speaker 5>what exactly does that mean?</v>

457
00:29:58.470 --> 00:30:00.520
<v Speaker 5>So it actually means something.</v>

458
00:30:00.521 --> 00:30:04.770
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of abstraction and it's actually an incredibly powerful instruction.</v>

459
00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.050
<v Speaker 5>Once you understand instruction,</v>

460
00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:12.850
<v Speaker 5>it be the most real abstraction there is going to layout with on.</v>

461
00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:15.270
<v Speaker 5>They offer you a little bit of</v>

462
00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:22.310
<v Speaker 5>and then that they're real and they're going to tell you what it means</v>

463
00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:25.153
<v Speaker 5>so</v>

464
00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:32.650
<v Speaker 5>you kale now will pay off,</v>

465
00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:33.793
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

466
00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:35.280
<v Speaker 5>they often.</v>

467
00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:41.380
<v Speaker 5>So one of the things that deal with this is something like</v>

468
00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:46.000
<v Speaker 5>this is not how people think,</v>

469
00:30:46.001 --> 00:30:48.710
<v Speaker 5>if you want to spray,</v>

470
00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:50.110
<v Speaker 5>because it is how we act,</v>

471
00:30:50.111 --> 00:30:51.220
<v Speaker 5>and as I said already,</v>

472
00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:56.730
<v Speaker 5>you act as if you confront and you treat pencil out as if it's real and if your</v>

473
00:30:59.741 --> 00:31:00.950
<v Speaker 5>attitude towards it,</v>

474
00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.640
<v Speaker 5>converters on you a certain World Vision,</v>

475
00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:08.790
<v Speaker 5>which is why you know what people need when they say you're not giving up,</v>

476
00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:12.280
<v Speaker 5>no one ever says</v>

477
00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:17.123
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

478
00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:20.230
<v Speaker 5>and very few people say,</v>

479
00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:20.561
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

480
00:31:20.561 --> 00:31:23.290
<v Speaker 5>I'm fully living up to my remit,</v>

481
00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:28.350
<v Speaker 5>is the reality that undergirds that consistent conception that makes that person</v>

482
00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:29.320
<v Speaker 5>off ability</v>

483
00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:30.503
<v Speaker 6>immediately.</v>

484
00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:34.840
<v Speaker 5>She lives in the future.</v>

485
00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:35.713
<v Speaker 5>That's part of it,</v>

486
00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:38.230
<v Speaker 5>and we believe in the future.</v>

487
00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:42.220
<v Speaker 5>We believe that it exists even though it isn't here and it's not measurable.</v>

488
00:31:42.221 --> 00:31:42.720
<v Speaker 5>It's.</v>

489
00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:47.050
<v Speaker 5>It only exists as a potential step up realizable often.</v>

490
00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:49.700
<v Speaker 5>That's what the future is really well.</v>

491
00:31:49.701 --> 00:31:50.440
<v Speaker 5>We're complaining with.</v>

492
00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:51.670
<v Speaker 5>We don't really contend,</v>

493
00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:57.390
<v Speaker 5>reorient yourself to future comes out direction,</v>

494
00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:05.150
<v Speaker 5>just signed as part of and how you construct the French.</v>

495
00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:08.493
<v Speaker 5>In the past,</v>

496
00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:14.020
<v Speaker 5>our payoff is retention and that's the problem.</v>

497
00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:17.870
<v Speaker 5>It's like if you're in a working,</v>

498
00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:21.280
<v Speaker 5>is there another way of consensual I needed?</v>

499
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:23.420
<v Speaker 5>Do I have a of</v>

500
00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:27.020
<v Speaker 5>another plan?</v>

501
00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:31.880
<v Speaker 5>It's something that I got put into a power that was make this terrible situation</v>

502
00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:36.970
<v Speaker 5>or that's all I have to call and use it to transfigure.</v>

503
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.150
<v Speaker 5>I'll eat this.</v>

504
00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:45.030
<v Speaker 7>He told me he more because of the wager conceptualizing.</v>

505
00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:48.240
<v Speaker 7>We need that.</v>

506
00:32:48.410 --> 00:32:53.410
<v Speaker 7>I understand it himself so bad that there are basically done.</v>

507
00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:56.240
<v Speaker 7>You have to do.</v>

508
00:32:56.390 --> 00:32:57.290
<v Speaker 7>People obviously</v>

509
00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:04.150
<v Speaker 7>got their businesses collapse and genuinely terrible things can happen to you</v>

510
00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:06.770
<v Speaker 7>that aren't your fault,</v>

511
00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:11.630
<v Speaker 7>that is not saying can just cheering them worldwide.</v>

512
00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:13.980
<v Speaker 7>That's pretty cool,</v>

513
00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:19.780
<v Speaker 7>but I understand that you have a tremendous ability to transform the landscape</v>

514
00:33:21.171 --> 00:33:25.460
<v Speaker 7>of possibilities in front of you and then when things are terrible,</v>

515
00:33:25.610 --> 00:33:27.260
<v Speaker 7>that's your best bet.</v>

516
00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:30.790
<v Speaker 7>Doesn't see just these.</v>

517
00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:32.600
<v Speaker 7>You don't have a better option,</v>

518
00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:38.020
<v Speaker 7>and so her pencil is also something that a terrible manner.</v>

519
00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:40.120
<v Speaker 7>So imagine this.</v>

520
00:33:40.121 --> 00:33:41.550
<v Speaker 7>This is really thinking about,</v>

521
00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:44.640
<v Speaker 7>so imagine that you have a relationship,</v>

522
00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:47.780
<v Speaker 7>let's say American now,</v>

523
00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:53.140
<v Speaker 7>the rear one trust and available us,</v>

524
00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:59.620
<v Speaker 7>and that's the trust and fidelity is the action of your memories.</v>

525
00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:02.823
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>

526
00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:03.380
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

527
00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:06.590
<v Speaker 7>let's lay it out for 10 years,</v>

528
00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:11.870
<v Speaker 7>and then your wife tells you that she has had three affairs,</v>

529
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:15.960
<v Speaker 7>each of them the last three years and the last one a lot this year.</v>

530
00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:23.540
<v Speaker 7>So then what happens?</v>

531
00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:24.403
<v Speaker 7>Then</v>

532
00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:28.400
<v Speaker 7>what happens is that everything you thought was wrong,</v>

533
00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:29.511
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

534
00:34:29.511 --> 00:34:33.760
<v Speaker 7>And this is such a disrespecting thing actually been in the past.</v>

535
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:35.740
<v Speaker 7>The past is</v>

536
00:34:37.390 --> 00:34:37.690
<v Speaker 7>there.</v>

537
00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:42.690
<v Speaker 7>All the sudden you find out that one of the things that you thought of the past</v>

538
00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:47.300
<v Speaker 7>that was very important thing wasn't true at all,</v>

539
00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:52.510
<v Speaker 7>and so work on meeting a whole task that you thought was was it wasn't what it</v>

540
00:34:52.511 --> 00:34:52.680
<v Speaker 7>was.</v>

541
00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:57.680
<v Speaker 7>It all so it transforms itself from a nationality is pretentious and most of</v>

542
00:35:00.351 --> 00:35:03.190
<v Speaker 7>them is native listener.</v>

543
00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:04.750
<v Speaker 7>The need</v>

544
00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:15.270
<v Speaker 7>for your marriage is dreadfully unhappy and you're just looking for an excuse to</v>

545
00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:16.933
<v Speaker 7>me.</v>

546
00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:18.910
<v Speaker 7>It's possible that that revelation,</v>

547
00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:20.400
<v Speaker 7>even though it was shocking,</v>

548
00:35:20.401 --> 00:35:22.790
<v Speaker 7>we will come with the spirit is released,</v>

549
00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:27.230
<v Speaker 7>so this repetitive professional manifest itself even when it's unexpected,</v>

550
00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:30.980
<v Speaker 7>it doesn't necessarily manifest itself in India.</v>

551
00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:33.200
<v Speaker 7>Got will also breed.</v>

552
00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:36.960
<v Speaker 7>If one thing to that</v>

553
00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:42.930
<v Speaker 5>and the trail was revealed and the divorce,</v>

554
00:35:42.931 --> 00:35:44.620
<v Speaker 5>can you set yourself up to two years?</v>

555
00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:46.330
<v Speaker 5>My work,</v>

556
00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:49.630
<v Speaker 5>it's not a pathway on written saying</v>

557
00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:57.360
<v Speaker 5>that's the introduction of the board and he need the oldest story that we have</v>

558
00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:05.360
<v Speaker 5>is something like order is susceptible to disruption by payoffs and human.</v>

559
00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:14.020
<v Speaker 5>The fundamental demands made on the human being is to contend with the chaos</v>

560
00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:15.350
<v Speaker 5>that is not work,</v>

561
00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:21.180
<v Speaker 5>not just in order to not pretend that the chaos is to encourage your children,</v>

562
00:36:23.881 --> 00:36:24.714
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

563
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:29.870
<v Speaker 5>what you're doing is encouraging you to become the masters of the chaos that is</v>

564
00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:34.640
<v Speaker 5>is an order is made some his of payoff,</v>

565
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:36.410
<v Speaker 5>which makes them not as important.</v>

566
00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:38.940
<v Speaker 5>You train your children,</v>

567
00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:43.530
<v Speaker 5>encourage your children and yourself and your partner from having sense to be a</v>

568
00:36:43.531 --> 00:36:45.560
<v Speaker 5>master of detail</v>

569
00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:48.750
<v Speaker 5>and so</v>

570
00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:52.250
<v Speaker 5>so this,</v>

571
00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:53.463
<v Speaker 5>this rough,</v>

572
00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:54.433
<v Speaker 5>disruptive.</v>

573
00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:59.660
<v Speaker 5>It's the infinite world to disrupt your financial considerations.</v>

574
00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:03.390
<v Speaker 5>That's another way of looking at another way of looking at it is it's the</v>

575
00:37:03.391 --> 00:37:08.130
<v Speaker 5>serpent in the garden of Eden and the reason that that story is set up the way</v>

576
00:37:08.131 --> 00:37:13.131
<v Speaker 5>it is because it's trying to represent that there was no place so bound and data</v>

577
00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:16.303
<v Speaker 5>secure.</v>

578
00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:18.840
<v Speaker 5>Even if it's set up my blog himself,</v>

579
00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:22.470
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't have an agent of chaos inside.</v>

580
00:37:23.110 --> 00:37:24.630
<v Speaker 5>It's exactly the same idea,</v>

581
00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:28.440
<v Speaker 5>but now here there's some more representation.</v>

582
00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:29.513
<v Speaker 5>It's just</v>

583
00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:32.550
<v Speaker 5>the question is,</v>

584
00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:34.133
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

585
00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:39.500
<v Speaker 5>what we do in regard given the sustainment and that's something like master the</v>

586
00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:42.753
<v Speaker 5>snakes,</v>

587
00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:46.860
<v Speaker 5>so and that's a neat idea.</v>

588
00:37:46.861 --> 00:37:48.240
<v Speaker 5>That's the same idea as</v>

589
00:37:51.070 --> 00:37:56.070
<v Speaker 5>sitting on the ocean rescue water from the belly of the whale.</v>

590
00:37:57.370 --> 00:38:02.370
<v Speaker 5>The same idea and that's an l greatest stories is your gross</v>

591
00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:10.150
<v Speaker 5>manifests itself together.</v>

592
00:38:10.151 --> 00:38:15.151
<v Speaker 5>Something as a consequence to the sure is there isn't a story that's more</v>

593
00:38:15.391 --> 00:38:18.810
<v Speaker 5>emblematic of what a nice event that that.</v>

594
00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:20.650
<v Speaker 5>That is a.</v>

595
00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:22.410
<v Speaker 5>that's our best bet.</v>

596
00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:24.661
<v Speaker 5>All right,</v>

597
00:38:24.661 --> 00:38:26.320
<v Speaker 5>so nails.</v>

598
00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:28.003
<v Speaker 5>You don't.</v>

599
00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:31.140
<v Speaker 5>It's a task that need to suddenly enter your left,</v>

600
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:31.941
<v Speaker 5>the office,</v>

601
00:38:31.941 --> 00:38:32.774
<v Speaker 5>the flood.</v>

602
00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:36.740
<v Speaker 5>It's definitely become ever present possibility.</v>

603
00:38:36.850 --> 00:38:38.780
<v Speaker 7>Apocalypse in your personal life,</v>

604
00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:39.663
<v Speaker 7>in your community.</v>

605
00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:41.810
<v Speaker 7>Like in the</v>

606
00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:45.193
<v Speaker 7>refinery,</v>

607
00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:50.000
<v Speaker 7>virgility existing in a world that's beyond me,</v>

608
00:38:50.110 --> 00:38:55.110
<v Speaker 7>off his potential lies before cause I need something can rescue yourself from</v>

609
00:38:58.250 --> 00:38:59.320
<v Speaker 7>seeing orders,</v>

610
00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:01.210
<v Speaker 7>permanent element,</v>

611
00:39:01.211 --> 00:39:02.044
<v Speaker 7>the existence.</v>

612
00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:04.030
<v Speaker 7>Chaos is what you don't know.</v>

613
00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:07.420
<v Speaker 7>What's outside the fire</v>

614
00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:10.013
<v Speaker 7>walls,</v>

615
00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:13.140
<v Speaker 7>walls of your town,</v>

616
00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:16.630
<v Speaker 7>outside of the borders of your passion.</v>

617
00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:20.300
<v Speaker 7>All of that is hail</v>

618
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:23.863
<v Speaker 6>or</v>

619
00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:28.480
<v Speaker 7>order is where you are.</v>

620
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:30.860
<v Speaker 7>What you're doing is working any matter.</v>

621
00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:34.430
<v Speaker 7>It's very specific.</v>

622
00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:39.060
<v Speaker 7>How do you know that you know what you're doing when you don't because you don't</v>

623
00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:40.973
<v Speaker 7>know everything.</v>

624
00:39:41.050 --> 00:39:43.170
<v Speaker 7>Everything you do is my ignorance,</v>

625
00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:45.540
<v Speaker 7>but you still have to operate in the world.</v>

626
00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:50.640
<v Speaker 7>This is what we do is make finite plans and then plans,</v>

627
00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:55.820
<v Speaker 7>maybe sap strategies to make those kinds manifested itself and if the consultant</v>

628
00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:01.230
<v Speaker 7>the way that you desire in any regard to knowledge,</v>

629
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:06.430
<v Speaker 7>so that's your difference between truth and it's the only definition you can use</v>

630
00:40:06.751 --> 00:40:11.751
<v Speaker 7>because you don't have everything at hand and when you're aware of is working,</v>

631
00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:16.170
<v Speaker 7>that's word and you might think why should just stay there?</v>

632
00:40:16.650 --> 00:40:21.650
<v Speaker 7>Because that's a comfortable place to be and there's a certain truth except for</v>

633
00:40:22.351 --> 00:40:24.540
<v Speaker 7>one thing if you</v>

634
00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:32.750
<v Speaker 7>word and you stand in it and wait,</v>

635
00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:38.600
<v Speaker 7>the disorder itself because things aren't stacked,</v>

636
00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:40.650
<v Speaker 7>things change all the time.</v>

637
00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:46.220
<v Speaker 7>You're finding yourself in a static structure is definitely trail because</v>

638
00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:51.580
<v Speaker 7>everything around you is blocks and the thing that's permanent rule transform</v>

639
00:40:53.221 --> 00:40:54.054
<v Speaker 7>itself.</v>

640
00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:55.610
<v Speaker 7>Here's an example.</v>

641
00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:57.800
<v Speaker 7>Let's say you're a perfectly well.</v>

642
00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:01.040
<v Speaker 7>We'll have a new rule you actually with.</v>

643
00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:02.410
<v Speaker 7>That's none of your children.</v>

644
00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:04.433
<v Speaker 7>Children,</v>

645
00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:06.783
<v Speaker 7>that's</v>

646
00:41:08.010 --> 00:41:11.070
<v Speaker 7>very mature form of children.</v>

647
00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:15.580
<v Speaker 7>They can be really delightful people to have like three years maybe paint them</v>

648
00:41:17.650 --> 00:41:18.483
<v Speaker 7>the reason</v>

649
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:20.930
<v Speaker 7>they hit puberty,</v>

650
00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:23.960
<v Speaker 7>which is the emergence of hail off into the,</v>

651
00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:25.220
<v Speaker 7>into the bowl,</v>

652
00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:30.240
<v Speaker 7>ready to go through the emergency sexuality in the descriptor that didn't have a</v>

653
00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:32.670
<v Speaker 7>deficit progression.</v>

654
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.120
<v Speaker 7>Do you ever get shot off the things?</v>

655
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:38.023
<v Speaker 7>Always do.</v>

656
00:41:38.290 --> 00:41:41.270
<v Speaker 7>It's know where to turn 16.</v>

657
00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:43.760
<v Speaker 7>You're no longer is like 11 year old.</v>

658
00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:48.830
<v Speaker 7>Very immature 16 years and the reason that I got out was because just because</v>

659
00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:50.250
<v Speaker 7>somebody is now</v>

660
00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:55.890
<v Speaker 7>five years from now and so in order to be stable,</v>

661
00:41:57.490 --> 00:41:58.790
<v Speaker 7>you're not the same thing.</v>

662
00:41:59.290 --> 00:42:03.690
<v Speaker 7>The dynamic not static,</v>

663
00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:08.870
<v Speaker 7>so you have to be very large bowing to where you're going and this opinion,</v>

664
00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:11.660
<v Speaker 7>both African,</v>

665
00:42:12.330 --> 00:42:13.760
<v Speaker 7>so it's stability,</v>

666
00:42:13.761 --> 00:42:18.761
<v Speaker 7>plus parents permission and manifest in your narrative,</v>

667
00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:23.810
<v Speaker 7>meaning that's actually the instinct meeting,</v>

668
00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:28.960
<v Speaker 7>which is an instinct to perhaps the precisely the instinct that tells you who</v>

669
00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:31.460
<v Speaker 7>are sufficiently stable.</v>

670
00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:35.870
<v Speaker 7>You transforming yourself at a sufficient rate up with everything.</v>

671
00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:39.350
<v Speaker 7>It's changed and you know that because if you're at your job,</v>

672
00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:40.640
<v Speaker 7>you to say yourself,</v>

673
00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:41.631
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

674
00:42:41.631 --> 00:42:42.870
<v Speaker 7>my job is really secure,</v>

675
00:42:42.871 --> 00:42:44.210
<v Speaker 7>but it's not very challenging.</v>

676
00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:50.250
<v Speaker 7>You think that it's very secure and that's it's not challenging.</v>

677
00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:55.430
<v Speaker 7>It's in the sense that the spirit goes out of it.</v>

678
00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:56.670
<v Speaker 7>If it's not challenging,</v>

679
00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:59.620
<v Speaker 7>you need to be challenged and why Israel?</v>

680
00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:01.070
<v Speaker 7>We've answered as well.</v>

681
00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:05.090
<v Speaker 7>Tomorrow's how and whoever you now this is enough for tomorrow,</v>

682
00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:10.190
<v Speaker 7>and so today you also have Laura and next week and next year,</v>

683
00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:13.860
<v Speaker 7>and if you're challenging and it isn't doing that for me,</v>

684
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.940
<v Speaker 7>and you find the need,</v>

685
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:20.600
<v Speaker 7>and the reason for that is that it's sliced your most essential instinct.</v>

686
00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:26.590
<v Speaker 7>Instinct is the instinct for meaning and it signifies that it actually seemed</v>

687
00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:28.603
<v Speaker 7>balanced,</v>

688
00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:30.583
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

689
00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:31.963
<v Speaker 7>We right,</v>

690
00:43:32.330 --> 00:43:35.280
<v Speaker 7>which is why it's fundamental open space paying us,</v>

691
00:43:35.310 --> 00:43:37.640
<v Speaker 7>nor are the most real things.</v>

692
00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:39.440
<v Speaker 7>Alright,</v>

693
00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:41.200
<v Speaker 7>so you have the payoff.</v>

694
00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:46.330
<v Speaker 7>It's not in scope and then he's not the order that you,</v>

695
00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:49.960
<v Speaker 7>your mastery.</v>

696
00:43:50.770 --> 00:43:51.640
<v Speaker 7>Let's take order.</v>

697
00:43:52.610 --> 00:43:57.320
<v Speaker 7>We're thinking about the structure order and I'm not saying,</v>

698
00:43:57.900 --> 00:43:59.840
<v Speaker 7>I'm not saying that at all.</v>

699
00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:03.010
<v Speaker 7>That's the balance,</v>

700
00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:04.010
<v Speaker 7>the balance.</v>

701
00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:08.780
<v Speaker 7>Even as important in this category,</v>

702
00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:11.420
<v Speaker 7>whether you liked development,</v>

703
00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:16.640
<v Speaker 7>their fundamental constituent elements of reality.</v>

704
00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:18.530
<v Speaker 7>You might say,</v>

705
00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:18.711
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

706
00:44:18.711 --> 00:44:20.070
<v Speaker 7>what's your evidence for that?</v>

707
00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:24.620
<v Speaker 7>And it can tell you one piece of evidence for very much time.</v>

708
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:28.750
<v Speaker 7>You have content experience needs to be great</v>

709
00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:31.863
<v Speaker 7>was your</v>

710
00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:34.063
<v Speaker 5>world.</v>

711
00:44:34.610 --> 00:44:38.020
<v Speaker 5>Your brain is the adaptive world,</v>

712
00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:44.660
<v Speaker 5>let's say fundamental strategy meeting structure and the bifurcation indicates</v>

713
00:44:46.561 --> 00:44:49.280
<v Speaker 5>that filed medical reality</v>

714
00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:56.000
<v Speaker 5>divided four</v>

715
00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:03.530
<v Speaker 5>and if you're working deposition reality is scientific,</v>

716
00:45:03.810 --> 00:45:05.050
<v Speaker 5>biological</v>

717
00:45:06.970 --> 00:45:09.450
<v Speaker 5>reality that shapes</v>

718
00:45:13.170 --> 00:45:18.170
<v Speaker 5>early perspective and they like bifurcated representation of life.</v>

719
00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:21.901
<v Speaker 5>It's a proper.</v>

720
00:45:21.901 --> 00:45:26.620
<v Speaker 5>We never did reality and perhaps the real itself is</v>

721
00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:32.950
<v Speaker 5>a nice logical evidence.</v>

722
00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:38.533
<v Speaker 5>American.</v>

723
00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:42.010
<v Speaker 5>You left spirit,</v>

724
00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:47.190
<v Speaker 5>specialized operations in those situations that you know and understand and</v>

725
00:45:47.401 --> 00:45:48.470
<v Speaker 5>you're right when the spirits</v>

726
00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:55.040
<v Speaker 5>in those situations that united no nor understand and the proper way to sell our</v>

727
00:45:57.080 --> 00:46:00.470
<v Speaker 5>was to be balanced operations.</v>

728
00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:01.710
<v Speaker 5>Correct.</v>

729
00:46:02.310 --> 00:46:07.020
<v Speaker 5>The way that manifests itself in different experiences as meaningful,</v>

730
00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:12.180
<v Speaker 5>so that's not an APP first path.</v>

731
00:46:13.650 --> 00:46:14.483
<v Speaker 5>What will you say?</v>

732
00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:18.220
<v Speaker 5>Justification for the that these two</v>

733
00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:24.770
<v Speaker 5>are the most real domain order over.</v>

734
00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:27.093
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

735
00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:30.120
<v Speaker 5>if you just sit there and who is that?</v>

736
00:46:30.121 --> 00:46:30.954
<v Speaker 5>What we think?</v>

737
00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:34.620
<v Speaker 5>Why will suffer and die?</v>

738
00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:36.000
<v Speaker 5>That's what will happen.</v>

739
00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:41.510
<v Speaker 5>So without actually apart deterioration in death,</v>

740
00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:45.050
<v Speaker 5>we meet at</v>

741
00:46:46.930 --> 00:46:47.763
<v Speaker 5>last</v>

742
00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:56.990
<v Speaker 5>3 billion years of evolution.</v>

743
00:46:57.020 --> 00:47:02.020
<v Speaker 5>The action actually move in the face of necessity is quite</v>

744
00:47:06.350 --> 00:47:07.840
<v Speaker 5>rewarding that</v>

745
00:47:09.730 --> 00:47:12.430
<v Speaker 5>you have to know</v>

746
00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:17.860
<v Speaker 5>that you have to have some.</v>

747
00:47:17.930 --> 00:47:20.310
<v Speaker 5>You need some water.</v>

748
00:47:20.311 --> 00:47:25.100
<v Speaker 5>Do you need some show that you need some kind of</v>

749
00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:27.750
<v Speaker 5>sexual partner</v>

750
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:30.833
<v Speaker 7>way?</v>

751
00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:38.420
<v Speaker 7>Actually nee nee people grinding way those same people across God you sins are</v>

752
00:47:42.671 --> 00:47:43.460
<v Speaker 7>necessary.</v>

753
00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:45.340
<v Speaker 7>Well as survival itself.</v>

754
00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:50.470
<v Speaker 7>Assumptions just sitting there.</v>

755
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:53.570
<v Speaker 7>It's not the right</v>

756
00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:56.953
<v Speaker 7>word,</v>

757
00:47:57.150 --> 00:47:58.370
<v Speaker 7>not in world.</v>

758
00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:03.420
<v Speaker 7>The Internet stops you from deteriorating guy at minimum and not being able to</v>

759
00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:09.940
<v Speaker 7>address the problems that are a Jersey for about now of 800 are in water.</v>

760
00:48:19.070 --> 00:48:19.903
<v Speaker 7>Sewage.</v>

761
00:48:20.170 --> 00:48:25.170
<v Speaker 7>The loan to the jurors is specialized.</v>

762
00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:26.880
<v Speaker 7>Bottom hole,</v>

763
00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:29.310
<v Speaker 7>you can bless it and afraid.</v>

00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:35.860
<v Speaker 7>almost a special assistance for all both you and your correctional systems</v>

766
00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:39.730
<v Speaker 7>orientation world and they have to figure out what to do so when you're hungry,</v>

767
00:48:39.731 --> 00:48:40.564
<v Speaker 7>it's time,</v>

768
00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:41.853
<v Speaker 7>it's</v>

769
00:48:43.690 --> 00:48:44.630
<v Speaker 7>time to seat belts.</v>

770
00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:50.620
<v Speaker 7>You have specialized system where there aren't enough because</v>

771
00:48:53.010 --> 00:48:53.843
<v Speaker 7>that's</v>

772
00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:57.280
<v Speaker 7>the problem with organizing.</v>

773
00:48:57.570 --> 00:48:58.130
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

774
00:48:58.130 --> 00:49:02.180
<v Speaker 7>well not the complaint.</v>

775
00:49:02.370 --> 00:49:03.630
<v Speaker 7>You have to do something,</v>

776
00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:08.670
<v Speaker 7>a little shelter and there is right now for the next two years from now,</v>

777
00:49:09.790 --> 00:49:10.780
<v Speaker 7>five years from now,</v>

778
00:49:10.781 --> 00:49:15.781
<v Speaker 7>so you have to have stretches of time now in the future you,</v>

779
00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:19.420
<v Speaker 7>this new family and the community,</v>

00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:24.540
<v Speaker 7>it's all done has to be taken into account in your movement for very,</v>

781
00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:30.040
<v Speaker 7>very close to Salt Civil Paisley and your motivational.</v>

782
00:49:30.130 --> 00:49:30.670
<v Speaker 7>50.</v>

783
00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:31.090
<v Speaker 7>Anger,</v>

784
00:49:31.090 --> 00:49:35.470
<v Speaker 7>hunger and so forth can help them solve those problems now,</v>

785
00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:36.970
<v Speaker 7>but not all of them.</v>

786
00:49:37.210 --> 00:49:39.750
<v Speaker 7>Permanent hire.</v>

787
00:49:40.110 --> 00:49:44.620
<v Speaker 7>All of our complex problems.</v>

788
00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:47.710
<v Speaker 7>How do we propagate the game across</v>

789
00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:55.380
<v Speaker 7>the left hemisphere operates we embarrassed when work.</v>

790
00:49:56.650 --> 00:50:00.910
<v Speaker 7>It's hard work like senior right hemisphere off.</v>

791
00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:04.160
<v Speaker 7>People don't like it going on accident,</v>

792
00:50:04.161 --> 00:50:05.950
<v Speaker 7>but it's the whole native emotion,</v>

793
00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:08.380
<v Speaker 7>the whole pain and anxiety.</v>

794
00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:13.950
<v Speaker 7>It's the thing that turns on I deeply did not expect if the terrorism onslaught</v>

795
00:50:17.251 --> 00:50:18.084
<v Speaker 7>of what we do</v>

796
00:50:19.620 --> 00:50:24.620
<v Speaker 7>now because used the right hemisphere in condition,</v>

797
00:50:25.091 --> 00:50:25.924
<v Speaker 7>standard</v>

798
00:50:28.610 --> 00:50:33.610
<v Speaker 7>artistic expression for all sorts of things you like so because it's also</v>

799
00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:41.210
<v Speaker 7>possible in the interim</v>

800
00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:48.430
<v Speaker 7>should you have to do is I'm going to</v>

801
00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:51.200
<v Speaker 7>use something.</v>

802
00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:55.940
<v Speaker 7>You have to do some definitional issue.</v>

803
00:50:56.570 --> 00:51:01.310
<v Speaker 7>This is an act out the proposition that the thing you're doing,</v>

804
00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:03.860
<v Speaker 7>Z is preferable.</v>

805
00:51:04.130 --> 00:51:07.600
<v Speaker 7>You have and we'll do it for those things.</v>

806
00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:08.433
<v Speaker 7>You're trying to get</v>

807
00:51:10.130 --> 00:51:10.963
<v Speaker 7>tangled.</v>

808
00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:13.440
<v Speaker 7>Say I'm eating,</v>

809
00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:15.070
<v Speaker 7>but I don't know.</v>

810
00:51:15.590 --> 00:51:20.240
<v Speaker 7>There's something wrong with the way you conceptualize that mistake because we</v>

811
00:51:20.241 --> 00:51:25.241
<v Speaker 7>did something and bring it into existence is the same as johnny and say,</v>

812
00:51:26.211 --> 00:51:26.391
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

813
00:51:26.391 --> 00:51:31.391
<v Speaker 7>that has been something because either your academic or you know what you're</v>

814
00:51:32.451 --> 00:51:33.284
<v Speaker 7>talking about.</v>

815
00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:34.193
<v Speaker 7>It's more</v>

816
00:51:35.470 --> 00:51:40.470
<v Speaker 7>confused that your action patterns and the girls health representation,</v>

817
00:51:43.090 --> 00:51:48.090
<v Speaker 7>but that doesn't mean that they're critics of just means that people use so</v>

818
00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:55.500
<v Speaker 7>after an awkward suffer in order to add value because much more than the Nata,</v>

819
00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:01.980
<v Speaker 7>which means happy topic of value,</v>

820
00:52:04.990 --> 00:52:09.190
<v Speaker 7>so we just start dying because it's</v>

821
00:52:12.350 --> 00:52:13.183
<v Speaker 7>not</v>

822
00:52:15.250 --> 00:52:16.083
<v Speaker 7>socially</v>

823
00:52:17.890 --> 00:52:18.723
<v Speaker 7>pursued.</v>

824
00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:24.320
<v Speaker 7>Aims in isolation because you're not not a solitary animals and your title and</v>

825
00:52:28.310 --> 00:52:32.840
<v Speaker 7>deeply private families,</v>

826
00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:34.033
<v Speaker 7>communities,</v>

827
00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:36.620
<v Speaker 7>our society and social.</v>

828
00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:37.620
<v Speaker 7>Every.</v>

829
00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:38.453
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

830
00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:43.400
<v Speaker 7>as long as we been Fridays,</v>

831
00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:45.110
<v Speaker 7>so maybe that's.</v>

832
00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:49.580
<v Speaker 7>That's at least six years and it might be more like $60 million.</v>

833
00:52:50.090 --> 00:52:52.030
<v Speaker 7>It's really all time.</v>

834
00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:55.640
<v Speaker 7>So it's not an arbitrary social construction.</v>

835
00:52:58.510 --> 00:53:01.120
<v Speaker 7>Now what happens start</v>

836
00:53:03.670 --> 00:53:05.740
<v Speaker 7>to hire.</v>

837
00:53:07.410 --> 00:53:08.243
<v Speaker 7>He</v>

838
00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:10.333
<v Speaker 7>Watch,</v>

839
00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:14.510
<v Speaker 7>let's say one thing is doing that.</v>

840
00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:16.830
<v Speaker 7>Enough happens me</v>

841
00:53:18.870 --> 00:53:23.870
<v Speaker 7>to do anything besides already promoting healthy things done and then you get</v>

842
00:53:28.170 --> 00:53:33.170
<v Speaker 7>whatever comes to me and the first thing he did around whatever.</v>

843
00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:38.850
<v Speaker 7>So and that is</v>

844
00:53:40.770 --> 00:53:41.870
<v Speaker 7>insane and</v>

845
00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:46.360
<v Speaker 7>people would ask me</v>

846
00:53:48.310 --> 00:53:49.790
<v Speaker 7>one visual landscape,</v>

847
00:53:51.550 --> 00:53:55.030
<v Speaker 7>something double back</v>

848
00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:59.490
<v Speaker 7>in Cleveland for a good activity.</v>

849
00:54:00.310 --> 00:54:04.980
<v Speaker 7>There's actually a law price's law and it's a real law.</v>

850
00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:07.660
<v Speaker 7>He's governed size,</v>

851
00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:13.080
<v Speaker 7>the massive star and just of cover covered price's law says that the square root</v>

852
00:54:16.701 --> 00:54:18.400
<v Speaker 7>of the number of people engaged in it,</v>

853
00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:19.253
<v Speaker 7>the pricing.</v>

854
00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:24.000
<v Speaker 7>So if you have 10 absolute</v>

855
00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:30.800
<v Speaker 7>candidate and if you have 10,000 in a how did this work and that you know how</v>

856
00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:40.200
<v Speaker 7>well the series itself such that a minority people have more money.</v>

857
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:43.170
<v Speaker 7>80 five richest people in the world,</v>

858
00:54:44.220 --> 00:54:45.090
<v Speaker 7>they have it.</v>

859
00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:49.870
<v Speaker 7>It's something like that and everybody goes from my boss and one percent it's</v>

860
00:54:49.871 --> 00:54:50.360
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

861
00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:51.560
<v Speaker 7>well first of all girl,</v>

862
00:54:51.570 --> 00:54:52.231
<v Speaker 7>one percent.</v>

863
00:54:52.231 --> 00:54:53.064
<v Speaker 7>So</v>

864
00:54:54.130 --> 00:54:54.963
<v Speaker 7>yourself</v>

865
00:54:57.430 --> 00:55:02.430
<v Speaker 7>speaking and by current standards and certain binders,</v>

866
00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:05.800
<v Speaker 7>you're all even one percent.</v>

867
00:55:06.210 --> 00:55:07.800
<v Speaker 7>So if that's a problem,</v>

868
00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:12.060
<v Speaker 7>well it's a problem for all of you might be,</v>

869
00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:12.810
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

870
00:55:12.810 --> 00:55:14.010
<v Speaker 7>Richard is app.</v>

871
00:55:14.130 --> 00:55:19.130
<v Speaker 7>That doesn't mean all in the same boat on the fact that wealth NCA to enhance</v>

872
00:55:20.910 --> 00:55:24.440
<v Speaker 7>the cable is part of the general expression.</v>

873
00:55:25.540 --> 00:55:26.760
<v Speaker 7>There's nothing special.</v>

874
00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:31.610
<v Speaker 7>You see the same thing every creative building in.</v>

875
00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:34.210
<v Speaker 7>How many of you have recorded a</v>

876
00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:36.720
<v Speaker 7>full record?</v>

877
00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:38.993
<v Speaker 7>How many?</v>

878
00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:40.500
<v Speaker 7>Five?</v>

879
00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:41.333
<v Speaker 7>Zero</v>

880
00:55:42.530 --> 00:55:43.363
<v Speaker 7>one.</v>

881
00:55:45.930 --> 00:55:48.810
<v Speaker 7>So there's one of the and that's one 10th of one percent.</v>

882
00:55:48.811 --> 00:55:49.644
<v Speaker 7>Something like that.</v>

883
00:55:49.950 --> 00:55:51.000
<v Speaker 7>How many of you have</v>

884
00:55:53.710 --> 00:55:57.230
<v Speaker 7>a date on obtaining?</v>

885
00:55:57.270 --> 00:55:59.350
<v Speaker 7>Is Hanging in national says here,</v>

886
00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:01.553
<v Speaker 7>look</v>

887
00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:09.080
<v Speaker 7>how many of you will be member of a professional sports team</v>

888
00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:13.100
<v Speaker 7>when we get the point here?</v>

889
00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:14.731
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>

890
00:56:14.731 --> 00:56:15.620
<v Speaker 7>so it was like,</v>

891
00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:36.020
<v Speaker 7>and so the rule</v>

892
00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:43.520
<v Speaker 7>system that you use and it doesn't know me well enough.</v>

893
00:56:44.050 --> 00:56:44.730
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

894
00:56:44.730 --> 00:56:45.850
<v Speaker 7>well here's something else</v>

895
00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:53.050
<v Speaker 7>started with guardian is an intrinsic</v>

896
00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:55.833
<v Speaker 7>deep</v>

897
00:56:57.220 --> 00:57:00.550
<v Speaker 7>suffering and you train itself,</v>

898
00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:03.580
<v Speaker 7>so that's the baseline.</v>

899
00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:04.810
<v Speaker 7>That's intolerable.</v>

900
00:57:04.910 --> 00:57:05.743
<v Speaker 7>Anyways,</v>

901
00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:08.380
<v Speaker 7>he was involved and immersed in digital.</v>

902
00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:13.420
<v Speaker 7>What we do with the base of something and you try to find something to justify</v>

903
00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:19.440
<v Speaker 7>having something that gives him the hell in the morning and not just any old</v>

904
00:57:19.851 --> 00:57:20.170
<v Speaker 7>one,</v>

905
00:57:20.170 --> 00:57:22.230
<v Speaker 7>but I'm more with your water,</v>

906
00:57:22.231 --> 00:57:27.231
<v Speaker 7>has Alzheimer's disease and your daughter have you need something to get out of</v>

907
00:57:27.371 --> 00:57:29.960
<v Speaker 7>bed for girls more than this two and half.</v>

908
00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:31.391
<v Speaker 7>The purpose,</v>

909
00:57:31.391 --> 00:57:32.224
<v Speaker 7>that</v>

910
00:57:33.390 --> 00:57:38.390
<v Speaker 7>purpose is going to be such that it better be a damn noble purpose because</v>

911
00:57:40.030 --> 00:57:42.640
<v Speaker 7>otherwise why important and so</v>

912
00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:48.270
<v Speaker 7>that's of sufficient tension,</v>

913
00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:49.113
<v Speaker 7>let's say,</v>

914
00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:51.140
<v Speaker 7>or valuable position.</v>

915
00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:57.200
<v Speaker 7>So worth suffering for because you're going to stop and you better have</v>

916
00:57:57.341 --> 00:57:58.810
<v Speaker 7>something that needs the suffering.</v>

917
00:57:58.810 --> 00:58:02.180
<v Speaker 7>Justify its structure,</v>

918
00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:04.343
<v Speaker 7>period</v>

919
00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:10.760
<v Speaker 7>when the flood comes in your life and certainly we'll build that will sustain</v>

920
00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:13.770
<v Speaker 7>for the catastrophe.</v>

921
00:58:14.910 --> 00:58:17.380
<v Speaker 7>That's not this pursuit of happiness.</v>

922
00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:19.890
<v Speaker 7>It's not even your.</v>

923
00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:24.910
<v Speaker 7>None of them is your orientation that we managed</v>

924
00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:27.740
<v Speaker 7>to hire.</v>

925
00:58:27.740 --> 00:58:32.410
<v Speaker 7>It's so high that it's worth bearing the burden of being reduced</v>

926
00:58:34.010 --> 00:58:38.100
<v Speaker 7>you implement out of Ireland now say,</v>

927
00:58:38.110 --> 00:58:38.943
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

928
00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:42.390
<v Speaker 7>and then it got higher priorities.</v>

929
00:58:42.850 --> 00:58:44.710
<v Speaker 7>Apparently people are going to be very good at.</v>

930
00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:49.800
<v Speaker 7>There's that higher desk and then you have the second girl admire when I asked</v>

931
00:58:51.071 --> 00:58:56.071
<v Speaker 7>you stick out your knee pain and they were very,</v>

932
00:58:57.430 --> 00:58:58.310
<v Speaker 7>very unlike.</v>

933
00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:01.890
<v Speaker 7>I'm not saying people all day</v>

934
00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:08.680
<v Speaker 7>extraordinary there and that's an inevitability.</v>

935
00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:10.990
<v Speaker 7>As soon as you decided something were doing,</v>

936
00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:13.460
<v Speaker 7>these people start</v>

937
00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:20.330
<v Speaker 7>to take would be or observed</v>

938
00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:25.460
<v Speaker 7>almost everybody else.</v>

939
00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:28.360
<v Speaker 7>What is the problem?</v>

940
00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:29.520
<v Speaker 7>Like IRA</v>

941
00:59:31.170 --> 00:59:31.800
<v Speaker 7>attendances,</v>

942
00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:36.800
<v Speaker 7>disintegration or most people bought and so that's the next thing,</v>

943
00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:40.100
<v Speaker 7>the hierarchies,</v>

944
00:59:40.580 --> 00:59:42.890
<v Speaker 7>because if going to</v>

945
00:59:45.030 --> 00:59:45.863
<v Speaker 7>die,</v>

946
00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:48.720
<v Speaker 7>you didn't want to die,</v>

947
00:59:50.490 --> 00:59:51.323
<v Speaker 7>solution</v>

948
00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:57.800
<v Speaker 7>will have the problem the higher and it's almost higher.</v>

949
00:59:59.110 --> 01:00:02.390
<v Speaker 7>Most people now typically agree with the lions.</v>

950
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:03.980
<v Speaker 7>Have something to say.</v>

951
01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:05.570
<v Speaker 7>That's what they say,</v>

952
01:00:08.170 --> 01:00:12.440
<v Speaker 7>and then look at that very carefully and he can say,</v>

953
01:00:12.790 --> 01:00:17.790
<v Speaker 7>that hasn't been a hierarchy itself or or we just finished.</v>

954
01:00:19.150 --> 01:00:23.050
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't mean you have no more issues</v>

955
01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:29.990
<v Speaker 7>to deal with that when it's actually in a way to deal with.</v>

956
01:00:29.991 --> 01:00:34.670
<v Speaker 7>That was the hardest political factor is that right?</v>

957
01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:36.280
<v Speaker 7>The deals with hierarchy,</v>

958
01:00:36.330 --> 01:00:37.340
<v Speaker 7>the department,</v>

959
01:00:37.341 --> 01:00:38.120
<v Speaker 7>this cost,</v>

960
01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:43.120
<v Speaker 7>so one of the things that you can reliably assume about someone's right is that</v>

961
01:00:44.331 --> 01:00:49.331
<v Speaker 7>they will be patriotic in favor of the current higher or being more.</v>

962
01:00:50.690 --> 01:00:53.780
<v Speaker 7>That's exactly the only new hire.</v>

963
01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:56.060
<v Speaker 7>It's up in.</v>

964
01:00:56.200 --> 01:01:00.020
<v Speaker 7>More people will be higher,</v>

965
01:01:00.370 --> 01:01:02.370
<v Speaker 7>so patient support.</v>

966
01:01:04.770 --> 01:01:09.770
<v Speaker 7>The people who are dispossessed by Harvey and when you have to say is,</v>

967
01:01:10.370 --> 01:01:11.203
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

968
01:01:11.330 --> 01:01:12.890
<v Speaker 7>we actually do something,</v>

969
01:01:12.891 --> 01:01:13.724
<v Speaker 7>most app,</v>

970
01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:15.720
<v Speaker 7>anything like that.</v>

971
01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:20.960
<v Speaker 7>The answer is no because there's no permanent solution to the problem of his</v>

972
01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:23.750
<v Speaker 7>possession by the higher.</v>

973
01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:26.450
<v Speaker 7>We don't know how to fix it.</v>

974
01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:27.640
<v Speaker 7>Say,</v>

975
01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:28.370
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

976
01:01:28.370 --> 01:01:30.550
<v Speaker 7>hire north slope.</v>

977
01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:34.310
<v Speaker 7>That's a price to pay,</v>

978
01:01:34.810 --> 01:01:37.160
<v Speaker 7>but we can take from the top at the bottom.</v>

979
01:01:37.161 --> 01:01:37.994
<v Speaker 7>It's like</v>

980
01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:40.393
<v Speaker 7>yes,</v>

981
01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:41.990
<v Speaker 7>hypothetically,</v>

982
01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:43.173
<v Speaker 7>good</v>

983
01:01:45.010 --> 01:01:45.843
<v Speaker 7>practice.</v>

984
01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:46.761
<v Speaker 7>It's very,</v>

985
01:01:46.761 --> 01:01:51.761
<v Speaker 7>very easy to go too far and then what we ended up with is less dispossessed.</v>

986
01:01:54.290 --> 01:01:58.670
<v Speaker 7>You ended up with no one who has anything that's</v>

987
01:02:00.990 --> 01:02:01.823
<v Speaker 7>scarcity,</v>

988
01:02:02.350 --> 01:02:02.990
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

989
01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:07.160
<v Speaker 7>They were equally debt or start with,</v>

990
01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:12.480
<v Speaker 7>which is essentially what the states did cross the entire 20th century is not</v>

991
01:02:13.641 --> 01:02:15.560
<v Speaker 7>the proper way to address.</v>

992
01:02:15.561 --> 01:02:19.040
<v Speaker 7>The higher there has to be addressed.</v>

993
01:02:22.250 --> 01:02:23.083
<v Speaker 7>Awesome.</v>

994
01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:25.070
<v Speaker 7>For you,</v>

995
01:02:25.730 --> 01:02:26.563
<v Speaker 7>this is a</v>

996
01:02:28.510 --> 01:02:29.343
<v Speaker 7>mirror</v>

997
01:02:31.030 --> 01:02:33.570
<v Speaker 7>system so they can stay there and without</v>

998
01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:36.043
<v Speaker 7>children</v>

999
01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:42.500
<v Speaker 7>or they can a higher becomes corrupt so that people who own theory and power</v>

1000
01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:43.793
<v Speaker 7>compliant,</v>

1001
01:02:43.820 --> 01:02:45.690
<v Speaker 7>it's just our</v>

1002
01:02:48.590 --> 01:02:49.290
<v Speaker 7>title,</v>

1003
01:02:49.290 --> 01:02:51.540
<v Speaker 7>which looks like a theory because there's all sorts of</v>

1004
01:02:54.010 --> 01:02:54.843
<v Speaker 7>weight</v>

1005
01:02:57.100 --> 01:02:57.933
<v Speaker 7>also.</v>

1006
01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:03.360
<v Speaker 7>If the higher steam that everybody stacks up with zero and you one can apply it</v>

1007
01:03:04.510 --> 01:03:07.890
<v Speaker 7>to basic definition of tyranny,</v>

1008
01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:10.890
<v Speaker 7>they don't have to write the thing,</v>

1009
01:03:11.730 --> 01:03:15.270
<v Speaker 7>the spring game because we're already at zero,</v>

1010
01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:17.150
<v Speaker 7>so we're going to help me not to lose.</v>

1011
01:03:17.550 --> 01:03:21.330
<v Speaker 7>And so one of the things that you want to do if you're a sensible concern of it,</v>

1012
01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:23.160
<v Speaker 7>is making sure that the hierarchy,</v>

1013
01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:24.001
<v Speaker 7>the gains,</v>

1014
01:03:24.001 --> 01:03:28.970
<v Speaker 7>it's Ruthie competence is transparent and it's likable.</v>

1015
01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:34.180
<v Speaker 7>You can otherwise equal ossify and Steven and then it will destroy itself and if</v>

1016
01:03:35.641 --> 01:03:36.480
<v Speaker 7>you're a conservative,</v>

1017
01:03:36.481 --> 01:03:37.420
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1018
01:03:37.470 --> 01:03:42.470
<v Speaker 7>stability and the hierarchy set up a situation where the tire itself so promote,</v>

1019
01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:48.830
<v Speaker 7>you can say,</v>

1020
01:03:48.830 --> 01:03:49.663
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1021
01:03:49.690 --> 01:03:50.523
<v Speaker 7>don't</v>

1022
01:03:52.550 --> 01:03:54.720
<v Speaker 7>you think Walter's</v>

1023
01:03:59.510 --> 01:04:04.510
<v Speaker 7>lonely is the hierarchical structure itself as a feature of existence,</v>

1024
01:04:05.970 --> 01:04:08.610
<v Speaker 7>at least a third of a billion years old,</v>

1025
01:04:09.030 --> 01:04:12.800
<v Speaker 7>which means that you cannot attribute.</v>

1026
01:04:13.050 --> 01:04:13.883
<v Speaker 7>Listen,</v>

1027
01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:17.340
<v Speaker 7>the free market or the corrupt patriarchal blessing</v>

1028
01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:23.880
<v Speaker 7>pasted all three of those elements contributed to existence on the stations</v>

1029
01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:30.373
<v Speaker 7>as</v>

1030
01:04:31.890 --> 01:04:35.910
<v Speaker 7>Nike is actually directed towards the left.</v>

1031
01:04:36.690 --> 01:04:41.690
<v Speaker 7>If you want to help this dispossess don't really exist in supplier is on.</v>

1032
01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:44.940
<v Speaker 7>Capitalism has it's wrong,</v>

1033
01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:46.410
<v Speaker 7>it's wrong.</v>

1034
01:04:46.530 --> 01:04:48.850
<v Speaker 7>That is way cheaper than mountain.</v>

1035
01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:51.050
<v Speaker 7>Here's something else to</v>

1036
01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:53.993
<v Speaker 7>consider.</v>

1037
01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:56.630
<v Speaker 7>So we are spectacular.</v>

1038
01:04:57.050 --> 01:04:57.883
<v Speaker 7>Dwelt</v>

1039
01:04:58.980 --> 01:05:01.210
<v Speaker 7>first in class or Iceland,</v>

1040
01:05:02.780 --> 01:05:05.340
<v Speaker 7>more wealthy than 100 years ago.</v>

1041
01:05:05.350 --> 01:05:06.580
<v Speaker 7>It's absolutely awesome.</v>

1042
01:05:07.610 --> 01:05:11.270
<v Speaker 7>And so that's the first passenger west exponential growth started.</v>

1043
01:05:11.730 --> 01:05:12.563
<v Speaker 7>You really,</v>

1044
01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:19.960
<v Speaker 7>really thought first announced faculty of the world.</v>

1045
01:05:20.730 --> 01:05:22.260
<v Speaker 7>I don't know his people.</v>

1046
01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:23.833
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

1047
01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:26.990
<v Speaker 7>you went and set a goal to have</v>

1048
01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:29.693
<v Speaker 7>it</v>

1049
01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:35.800
<v Speaker 7>ready will ever report we obtained in 2000,</v>

1050
01:05:35.900 --> 01:05:36.460
<v Speaker 7>12,</v>

1051
01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:40.390
<v Speaker 7>three years ahead of the most optimistic record.</v>

1052
01:05:40.391 --> 01:05:43.050
<v Speaker 7>So people are lifted on greatness,</v>

1053
01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:44.210
<v Speaker 7>has never been</v>

1054
01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:46.613
<v Speaker 7>broken,</v>

1055
01:05:47.140 --> 01:05:47.973
<v Speaker 7>divided</v>

1056
01:05:49.470 --> 01:05:50.450
<v Speaker 7>with fruit,</v>

1057
01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:51.880
<v Speaker 7>with access to the first one.</v>

1058
01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:54.280
<v Speaker 7>Why did you have access to medications?</v>

1059
01:05:54.281 --> 01:05:54.950
<v Speaker 7>Going deeper?</v>

1060
01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:57.480
<v Speaker 7>What would probably be like kiss?</v>

1061
01:05:57.640 --> 01:05:58.300
<v Speaker 7>It's.</v>

1062
01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:01.510
<v Speaker 7>There are so many things in business so fast we cannot even believe it.</v>

1063
01:06:02.590 --> 01:06:03.423
<v Speaker 7>And here's</v>

1064
01:06:05.180 --> 01:06:06.140
<v Speaker 7>as far as the data,</v>

1065
01:06:06.290 --> 01:06:11.290
<v Speaker 7>we have the operation of the free market system which does inequality.</v>

1066
01:06:11.650 --> 01:06:12.490
<v Speaker 7>That's the thing,</v>

1067
01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:14.350
<v Speaker 7>but as far as I can tell,</v>

1068
01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:19.630
<v Speaker 7>the system that has every well and as long as it's every system produces</v>

1069
01:06:20.441 --> 01:06:21.280
<v Speaker 7>inequality,</v>

1070
01:06:22.750 --> 01:06:24.800
<v Speaker 7>but only system we know that cruises,</v>

1071
01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:25.810
<v Speaker 7>for instance,</v>

1072
01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:27.313
<v Speaker 7>adding,</v>

1073
01:06:27.350 --> 01:06:32.140
<v Speaker 7>holding the remark so when you're forever left and right,</v>

1074
01:06:32.350 --> 01:06:35.750
<v Speaker 7>how many units of inequality it as well,</v>

1075
01:06:37.090 --> 01:06:38.620
<v Speaker 7>and if the answer is zero,</v>

1076
01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:43.720
<v Speaker 7>then once you're outside the appropriate date,</v>

1077
01:06:44.990 --> 01:06:46.280
<v Speaker 7>that's the romance.</v>

1078
01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:49.720
<v Speaker 7>And if you try to impose that will be his name.</v>

1079
01:06:50.070 --> 01:06:52.420
<v Speaker 7>There's the price we paid for.</v>

1080
01:06:52.421 --> 01:06:53.254
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1081
01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:54.520
<v Speaker 7>is it important?</v>

1082
01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:55.421
<v Speaker 7>Now,</v>

1083
01:06:55.421 --> 01:07:00.110
<v Speaker 7>that doesn't mean that you've committed to this extreme.</v>

1084
01:07:00.770 --> 01:07:01.930
<v Speaker 7>On the other phone,</v>

1085
01:07:02.010 --> 01:07:03.600
<v Speaker 7>it's just the whole thing,</v>

1086
01:07:05.380 --> 01:07:06.213
<v Speaker 7>what happens,</v>

1087
01:07:06.420 --> 01:07:07.253
<v Speaker 7>all the data,</v>

1088
01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:11.400
<v Speaker 7>lay it out and zero,</v>

1089
01:07:11.830 --> 01:07:12.390
<v Speaker 7>zero,</v>

1090
01:07:12.390 --> 01:07:13.223
<v Speaker 7>one person.</v>

1091
01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:15.140
<v Speaker 7>Now complaints.</v>

1092
01:07:16.170 --> 01:07:21.070
<v Speaker 7>The advocacy states his specialty is needed because there's a fair bit of chance</v>

1093
01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:23.650
<v Speaker 7>or the awkward world,</v>

1094
01:07:26.170 --> 01:07:28.360
<v Speaker 7>but the logical conclusion from the hierarchy,</v>

1095
01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:33.140
<v Speaker 7>the complaints is that one person has everything and everyone's not.</v>

1096
01:07:33.620 --> 01:07:35.560
<v Speaker 7>Obviously that's fine,</v>

1097
01:07:36.810 --> 01:07:37.643
<v Speaker 7>so,</v>

1098
01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:40.270
<v Speaker 7>so you know when they're awake.</v>

1099
01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:42.040
<v Speaker 7>In our society</v>

1100
01:07:43.590 --> 01:07:44.600
<v Speaker 7>we have progressive tax.</v>

1101
01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:45.533
<v Speaker 7>Hold</v>

1102
01:07:46.940 --> 01:07:51.940
<v Speaker 7>on real quick before I get another way of rectifying that people will have on</v>

1103
01:07:53.470 --> 01:07:54.303
<v Speaker 7>game,</v>

1104
01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:54.840
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1105
01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:56.190
<v Speaker 7>For Society,</v>

1106
01:07:56.320 --> 01:08:01.320
<v Speaker 7>we are many many things people can play and so if you're a lawyer in a,</v>

1107
01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:06.060
<v Speaker 7>if you can run small restaurant,</v>

1108
01:08:06.250 --> 01:08:11.250
<v Speaker 7>it was a diversity of age and so that's a good way of allowing of increasing</v>

1109
01:08:13.330 --> 01:08:16.400
<v Speaker 7>robustness and consistent so that you don't get higher</v>

1110
01:08:21.010 --> 01:08:25.830
<v Speaker 7>instigated roses perhaps it's an intractable problem.</v>

1111
01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:29.200
<v Speaker 7>It says one of the things from the end</v>

1112
01:08:30.710 --> 01:08:31.543
<v Speaker 7>station,</v>

1113
01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:33.910
<v Speaker 7>the war will be business always.</v>

1114
01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:35.810
<v Speaker 7>What's that in reference to?</v>

1115
01:08:35.810 --> 01:08:40.810
<v Speaker 7>It's also in reference to the Napkin and happens to be an economics</v>

1116
01:08:43.390 --> 01:08:46.890
<v Speaker 7>of everything from those things.</v>

1117
01:08:47.270 --> 01:08:48.470
<v Speaker 7>Everything will be taken.</v>

1118
01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:53.120
<v Speaker 7>That's the structure of the world and he can't lay it at the feet of progress.</v>

1119
01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:55.100
<v Speaker 7>It's the structure of the world.</v>

1120
01:08:55.460 --> 01:08:55.611
<v Speaker 7>Now.</v>

1121
01:08:55.611 --> 01:09:00.600
<v Speaker 7>That means we have to contend with is a part of the reason that we haven't</v>

1122
01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:03.890
<v Speaker 7>continued political file and that we need to have</v>

1123
01:09:05.590 --> 01:09:08.990
<v Speaker 7>is to make sure our hierarchies exist.</v>

1124
01:09:09.340 --> 01:09:14.340
<v Speaker 7>Maybe attack the Rock and being elected to that,</v>

1125
01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:22.420
<v Speaker 7>but that means the left has that higher level necessarily,</v>

1126
01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:24.560
<v Speaker 7>but valuable in the past will,</v>

1127
01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:28.150
<v Speaker 7>despite your necessity as a tenant,</v>

1128
01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:29.870
<v Speaker 7>the stack people up at the bottom.</v>

1129
01:09:32.890 --> 01:09:34.010
<v Speaker 7>You see that in</v>

1130
01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:41.220
<v Speaker 7>you see that the old testament because one of the things that happens when you</v>

1131
01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:45.900
<v Speaker 7>in the state and empire status,</v>

1132
01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:51.060
<v Speaker 7>six times the machine off stuff and then is corrupt.</v>

1133
01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:54.710
<v Speaker 7>It loses the way it is.</v>

1134
01:09:54.730 --> 01:09:55.740
<v Speaker 7>Balancing things,</v>

1135
01:09:57.710 --> 01:09:58.543
<v Speaker 7>the kidneys,</v>

1136
01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:02.320
<v Speaker 7>so the people and then forgetting your relationship with God.</v>

1137
01:10:02.410 --> 01:10:07.300
<v Speaker 7>That's another way of thinking and then it says you are paying enough attention</v>

1138
01:10:07.301 --> 01:10:12.301
<v Speaker 7>to the widows and the more you better thought and these devices in their</v>

1139
01:10:13.650 --> 01:10:17.190
<v Speaker 7>narrative thing that what's going to us</v>

1140
01:10:19.450 --> 01:10:22.330
<v Speaker 7>and so they don't take the steps necessary.</v>

1141
01:10:22.331 --> 01:10:23.400
<v Speaker 7>Corrective by here,</v>

1142
01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:28.500
<v Speaker 7>deviation from the path and they absolutely flattened and the consequences of</v>

1143
01:10:29.381 --> 01:10:30.940
<v Speaker 7>that last generation,</v>

1144
01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:35.910
<v Speaker 7>but second generation and then struggled growing up in something approximating</v>

1145
01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:37.220
<v Speaker 7>empires test again.</v>

1146
01:10:37.260 --> 01:10:39.190
<v Speaker 7>It's exactly the same thing happens.</v>

1147
01:10:39.510 --> 01:10:43.390
<v Speaker 7>We forget and we collect stories</v>

1148
01:10:45.510 --> 01:10:50.510
<v Speaker 7>by the Canadian literary people</v>

1149
01:10:53.310 --> 01:10:58.290
<v Speaker 7>to break them so there's no such</v>

1150
01:11:01.260 --> 01:11:04.210
<v Speaker 7>thing as a nice adjunct,</v>

1151
01:11:04.420 --> 01:11:06.400
<v Speaker 7>so so,</v>

1152
01:11:07.570 --> 01:11:11.980
<v Speaker 7>so that's the nature of who are ordered chaos and order.</v>

1153
01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:16.130
<v Speaker 7>Your goal is your relationship.</v>

1154
01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:21.260
<v Speaker 7>If you do that by meeting a lot more expedient,</v>

1155
01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:22.760
<v Speaker 7>that's safe,</v>

1156
01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:29.200
<v Speaker 7>ensure that you have the third property by taking his life.</v>

1157
01:11:31.940 --> 01:11:36.670
<v Speaker 7>You want to pat all the instinct that orients in the world and you will have</v>

1158
01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:37.980
<v Speaker 7>engaged,</v>

1159
01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:40.830
<v Speaker 7>engaging with the sea and the reason you do that,</v>

1160
01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:42.270
<v Speaker 7>we just practice something.</v>

1161
01:11:42.630 --> 01:11:46.970
<v Speaker 7>We build structures that specialize in math and any level of it.</v>

1162
01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:48.930
<v Speaker 7>So if you're living a lie,</v>

1163
01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:53.810
<v Speaker 7>this is very thing to do and you're building neurological mechanisms that go</v>

1164
01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:56.010
<v Speaker 7>through that lie and once they're built,</v>

1165
01:11:56.070 --> 01:11:57.060
<v Speaker 7>they're you.</v>

1166
01:11:57.570 --> 01:11:58.280
<v Speaker 7>And good luck.</v>

1167
01:11:58.280 --> 01:11:59.113
<v Speaker 7>Undoing</v>

1168
01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:01.700
<v Speaker 7>the Parker House</v>

1169
01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:04.550
<v Speaker 7>is built.</v>

1170
01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:06.630
<v Speaker 7>Negativism surf</v>

1171
01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:11.610
<v Speaker 7>for and those systems are alive.</v>

1172
01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:14.910
<v Speaker 7>All they want is to grow up and they're not,</v>

1173
01:12:14.930 --> 01:12:16.380
<v Speaker 7>it's not psychological.</v>

1174
01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:18.380
<v Speaker 7>It cycled as he was.</v>

1175
01:12:19.050 --> 01:12:24.050
<v Speaker 7>Don't build structures and prohibition predicated on deception because you will</v>

1176
01:12:24.241 --> 01:12:28.610
<v Speaker 7>pay that and so if you're going to guide your life with the orientation of the</v>

1177
01:12:28.630 --> 01:12:33.050
<v Speaker 7>instincts that meaning you have to be very careful what we say and write.</v>

1178
01:12:33.051 --> 01:12:36.850
<v Speaker 7>The thing is every time you say or write with and something,</v>

1179
01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:41.880
<v Speaker 7>you build the little girl that specialized to that and they participates in this</v>

1180
01:12:42.130 --> 01:12:42.990
<v Speaker 7>of the world.</v>

1181
01:12:43.620 --> 01:12:45.060
<v Speaker 7>So right.</v>

1182
01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:52.873
<v Speaker 7>Chaos.</v>

1183
01:12:54.250 --> 01:12:57.940
<v Speaker 7>Or is it higher is here's the next book</v>

1184
01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:03.530
<v Speaker 7>is order a higher.</v>

1185
01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:09.790
<v Speaker 7>The subsidiary questions will be the hierarchy.</v>

1186
01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:10.833
<v Speaker 7>What's.</v>

1187
01:13:11.110 --> 01:13:11.351
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1188
01:13:11.351 --> 01:13:13.600
<v Speaker 7>I don't live off of the hierarchy.</v>

1189
01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:20.840
<v Speaker 7>The hierarchy does not want what to be down.</v>

1190
01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:24.943
<v Speaker 7>So</v>

1191
01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:30.460
<v Speaker 7>the first thing I could see his orders not at Meijer.</v>

1192
01:13:32.030 --> 01:13:33.120
<v Speaker 7>What are the same?</v>

1193
01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:36.270
<v Speaker 7>That's a different thing.</v>

1194
01:13:36.990 --> 01:13:37.823
<v Speaker 7>So</v>

1195
01:13:40.430 --> 01:13:44.140
<v Speaker 7>I take a job</v>

1196
01:13:47.350 --> 01:13:49.070
<v Speaker 7>and a job briefing.</v>

1197
01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:49.913
<v Speaker 7>Soccer?</v>

1198
01:13:51.970 --> 01:13:52.803
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

1199
01:14:04.230 --> 01:14:07.430
<v Speaker 7>my son is still pretty good.</v>

1200
01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:12.553
<v Speaker 7>Rena,</v>

1201
01:14:13.140 --> 01:14:13.973
<v Speaker 7>just down the street</v>

1202
01:14:16.710 --> 01:14:17.170
<v Speaker 7>there.</v>

1203
01:14:17.170 --> 01:14:22.170
<v Speaker 7>And so it's sort the kids into these games and if team was getting skunked flap</v>

1204
01:14:25.830 --> 01:14:30.420
<v Speaker 7>or any other things winning too much and then rebalance the teams so that they</v>

1205
01:14:30.610 --> 01:14:33.910
<v Speaker 7>are equal in skill.</v>

1206
01:14:34.510 --> 01:14:36.250
<v Speaker 7>So that was the sliding fees.</v>

1207
01:14:36.850 --> 01:14:37.683
<v Speaker 7>So</v>

1208
01:14:39.020 --> 01:14:43.860
<v Speaker 7>and then we're on the way it behaves during</v>

1209
01:14:45.690 --> 01:14:46.523
<v Speaker 7>one.</v>

1210
01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:48.833
<v Speaker 7>And</v>

1211
01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:52.630
<v Speaker 7>so when my son was deep within,</v>

1212
01:14:53.260 --> 01:14:58.260
<v Speaker 7>I think it was the championship game correctly and there's one kid on his team</v>

1213
01:14:59.330 --> 01:15:00.850
<v Speaker 7>who was the best player</v>

1214
01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:06.460
<v Speaker 7>very fast on his feet because he gets to</v>

1215
01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:09.003
<v Speaker 7>eat.</v>

1216
01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:11.633
<v Speaker 7>But um,</v>

1217
01:15:12.890 --> 01:15:13.810
<v Speaker 7>that's problem.</v>

1218
01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:20.640
<v Speaker 7>One problem was he wasn't passed on now to talk with you pretty much answer as</v>

1219
01:15:24.971 --> 01:15:25.804
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1220
01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:31.120
<v Speaker 7>but you want to be the best person on the team</v>

1221
01:15:32.630 --> 01:15:33.560
<v Speaker 7>and you want to read the,</v>

1222
01:15:35.070 --> 01:15:37.320
<v Speaker 7>my boss wants to walk.</v>

1223
01:15:37.630 --> 01:15:39.340
<v Speaker 7>Maybe your team mates,</v>

1224
01:15:39.341 --> 01:15:40.270
<v Speaker 7>band player.</v>

1225
01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:41.690
<v Speaker 7>How's that?</v>

1226
01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:44.760
<v Speaker 7>Maybe you want to meet the people on the team player.</v>

1227
01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:46.990
<v Speaker 7>I did a little bit too far,</v>

1228
01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:52.030
<v Speaker 7>but she certainly want to make your teammates better plan anyway,</v>

1229
01:15:52.031 --> 01:15:54.630
<v Speaker 7>I think we'll want to do that because bad people.</v>

1230
01:15:56.590 --> 01:15:56.741
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1231
01:15:56.741 --> 01:16:01.120
<v Speaker 7>that's at world because first of all,</v>

1232
01:16:01.650 --> 01:16:03.580
<v Speaker 7>if you ran across the contribution around you,</v>

1233
01:16:03.710 --> 01:16:08.710
<v Speaker 7>is that a little better and it's a helpful way to win by making everyone else</v>

1234
01:16:09.551 --> 01:16:10.384
<v Speaker 7>load.</v>

1235
01:16:11.020 --> 01:16:16.020
<v Speaker 7>It's not much of a victory and so we passed the damn pop,</v>

1236
01:16:17.980 --> 01:16:19.210
<v Speaker 7>especially who,</v>

1237
01:16:19.211 --> 01:16:20.044
<v Speaker 7>especially you.</v>

1238
01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:22.720
<v Speaker 7>So you've got a comfortable lead.</v>

1239
01:16:23.730 --> 01:16:28.730
<v Speaker 7>Well then maybe risk taking time to wait for that specific game to build up the</v>

1240
01:16:31.790 --> 01:16:36.790
<v Speaker 7>confidence in the ability of the and then maybe every leader they make your not</v>

1241
01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:44.180
<v Speaker 7>even so much because you're the best for but because why not?</v>

1242
01:16:45.420 --> 01:16:45.730
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

1243
01:16:45.730 --> 01:16:48.660
<v Speaker 7>So once again we're pretty excited,</v>

1244
01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:53.330
<v Speaker 7>real close and it's like three to three and it's a minute lap.</v>

1245
01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:54.880
<v Speaker 7>Another to you.</v>

1246
01:16:55.490 --> 01:16:58.240
<v Speaker 7>This in stores really cool.</v>

1247
01:16:58.450 --> 01:17:03.450
<v Speaker 7>And so my son speed limits except that they were in the championship and it was</v>

1248
01:17:03.940 --> 01:17:04.900
<v Speaker 7>a pretty good thing.</v>

1249
01:17:05.950 --> 01:17:07.630
<v Speaker 7>So you know whether or not they lost.</v>

1250
01:17:07.940 --> 01:17:09.040
<v Speaker 7>It's not lost.</v>

1251
01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:10.153
<v Speaker 7>Hey,</v>

1252
01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:10.770
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1253
01:17:10.770 --> 01:17:13.520
<v Speaker 7>here's the broader integration.</v>

1254
01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:14.061
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>

1255
01:17:14.061 --> 01:17:16.000
<v Speaker 7>so this</v>

1256
01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:25.700
<v Speaker 7>one for the scenario because as far as I'm concerned,</v>

1257
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:26.743
<v Speaker 7>he was</v>

1258
01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:29.000
<v Speaker 7>useless.</v>

1259
01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.900
<v Speaker 7>Teammates who is helping,</v>

1260
01:17:33.630 --> 01:17:34.020
<v Speaker 7>correct.</v>

1261
01:17:34.020 --> 01:17:35.570
<v Speaker 7>What is fair,</v>

1262
01:17:35.780 --> 01:17:40.780
<v Speaker 7>who had helped those idiots farther rushes over to him.</v>

1263
01:17:42.630 --> 01:17:47.630
<v Speaker 7>And his loss and supports have been this notion that he was wrong and I thought</v>

1264
01:17:51.140 --> 01:17:51.973
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>

1265
01:17:56.740 --> 01:17:57.573
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>

1266
01:18:02.850 --> 01:18:03.683
<v Speaker 7>way more</v>

1267
01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:07.650
<v Speaker 7>than he had a son who was a star.</v>

1268
01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:10.450
<v Speaker 7>Then she had a son who is in good versus.</v>

1269
01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:12.950
<v Speaker 7>Yes,</v>

1270
01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:17.210
<v Speaker 7>absolutely you gave the wrong choice.</v>

1271
01:18:17.540 --> 01:18:19.620
<v Speaker 7>He sacrificed in some school,</v>

1272
01:18:19.710 --> 01:18:20.630
<v Speaker 7>in part,</v>

1273
01:18:21.180 --> 01:18:26.180
<v Speaker 7>she helped them save face for game that's not acceptable.</v>

1274
01:18:29.340 --> 01:18:30.790
<v Speaker 7>So here's what you tell them to tilt.</v>

1275
01:18:33.300 --> 01:18:38.300
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't matter if you indicate that's what the production side of it and</v>

1276
01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:43.510
<v Speaker 7>better knowing what it meant.</v>

1277
01:18:43.990 --> 01:18:45.310
<v Speaker 7>But who knows what that means.</v>

1278
01:18:45.940 --> 01:18:49.830
<v Speaker 7>If you tell a joke or not and maybe they're going to walk again,</v>

1279
01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:51.033
<v Speaker 7>go,</v>

1280
01:18:51.510 --> 01:18:52.360
<v Speaker 7>you're an alien</v>

1281
01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.920
<v Speaker 7>lg right out because obviously,</v>

1282
01:18:57.750 --> 01:18:59.900
<v Speaker 7>and he got mad with you.</v>

1283
01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:01.530
<v Speaker 7>So what does it mean?</v>

1284
01:19:01.630 --> 01:19:02.500
<v Speaker 7>Say that.</v>

1285
01:19:02.770 --> 01:19:04.810
<v Speaker 7>And what do you mean by that?</v>

1286
01:19:04.811 --> 01:19:05.950
<v Speaker 7>And Go,</v>

1287
01:19:06.190 --> 01:19:06.461
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1288
01:19:06.461 --> 01:19:07.300
<v Speaker 7>I don't know what it needs,</v>

1289
01:19:07.301 --> 01:19:08.320
<v Speaker 7>but it's a good thing.</v>

1290
01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:13.760
<v Speaker 7>So what do you mean by that?</v>

1291
01:19:14.260 --> 01:19:15.290
<v Speaker 7>Here's grabbing me</v>

1292
01:19:17.350 --> 01:19:19.280
<v Speaker 7>a little bit.</v>

1293
01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:25.920
<v Speaker 7>Because other people would just like to dislike.</v>

1294
01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:27.531
<v Speaker 7>Unless you walk.</v>

1295
01:19:27.531 --> 01:19:29.870
<v Speaker 7>The children who have a goal for everyone,</v>

1296
01:19:29.950 --> 01:19:31.200
<v Speaker 7>dislikes them.</v>

1297
01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:35.160
<v Speaker 7>Don't let the children</v>

1298
01:19:38.700 --> 01:19:43.480
<v Speaker 7>take retention so that other people will punish them because you don't have the</v>

1299
01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:44.713
<v Speaker 7>discipline.</v>

1300
01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:46.830
<v Speaker 7>People don't find that.</v>

1301
01:19:46.900 --> 01:19:51.680
<v Speaker 7>A lot of people make time for it,</v>

1302
01:19:51.750 --> 01:19:52.583
<v Speaker 7>so</v>

1303
01:19:58.230 --> 01:19:59.280
<v Speaker 7>let's take that apart.</v>

1304
01:19:59.630 --> 01:20:04.630
<v Speaker 7>The first thing is ms dot Garcia's hierarchy in order to hire their answer is</v>

1305
01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:05.953
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

1306
01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:11.360
<v Speaker 7>it's a fire or it's the set of all possible.</v>

1307
01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:15.810
<v Speaker 7>However you guys do in a society time.</v>

1308
01:20:16.150 --> 01:20:19.880
<v Speaker 7>There's higher that transforms the hierarchy,</v>

1309
01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:24.010
<v Speaker 7>the civics and the hierarchies.</v>

1310
01:20:24.310 --> 01:20:25.143
<v Speaker 7>Jane,</v>

1311
01:20:25.220 --> 01:20:27.450
<v Speaker 7>the fact that the higher rebate,</v>

1312
01:20:27.950 --> 01:20:32.950
<v Speaker 7>and so you've been in hierarchy as a structures to a multitude of possible</v>

1313
01:20:33.931 --> 01:20:36.240
<v Speaker 7>higher that's going to change.</v>

1314
01:20:36.241 --> 01:20:40.920
<v Speaker 7>His life continues and so what were your children is not even master's out</v>

1315
01:20:40.921 --> 01:20:42.890
<v Speaker 7>higher than you want them to,</v>

1316
01:20:42.900 --> 01:20:44.720
<v Speaker 7>children's to be the master of the sand,</v>

1317
01:20:44.721 --> 01:20:47.310
<v Speaker 7>the whole possible higher ed.</v>

1318
01:20:47.780 --> 01:20:49.890
<v Speaker 7>Then no matter how things change their rate,</v>

1319
01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:51.040
<v Speaker 7>see,</v>

1320
01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:51.180
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1321
01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:54.150
<v Speaker 7>how is it for things to change?</v>

1322
01:20:54.450 --> 01:20:58.050
<v Speaker 7>Answer this way so that people will invite you to play.</v>

1323
01:20:59.230 --> 01:20:59.700
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

1324
01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:04.700
<v Speaker 7>There's the Google Group for children raising children is really rule.</v>

1325
01:21:05.250 --> 01:21:06.083
<v Speaker 7>One of the things.</v>

1326
01:21:07.330 --> 01:21:08.660
<v Speaker 7>This is something who's present,</v>

1327
01:21:08.890 --> 01:21:10.250
<v Speaker 7>who's been anointed</v>

1328
01:21:12.290 --> 01:21:13.260
<v Speaker 7>to agendas.</v>

1329
01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:18.550
<v Speaker 7>It's really good for children to play Nice.</v>

1330
01:21:19.740 --> 01:21:20.221
<v Speaker 7>First of all,</v>

1331
01:21:20.221 --> 01:21:25.221
<v Speaker 7>if you have children in play because you know that they asked us,</v>

1332
01:21:26.050 --> 01:21:31.050
<v Speaker 7>they will rough and tumble play with you until you are completely exhausted and</v>

1333
01:21:33.061 --> 01:21:34.070
<v Speaker 7>they're not even.</v>

1334
01:21:34.890 --> 01:21:36.250
<v Speaker 7>They explained</v>

1335
01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:42.260
<v Speaker 7>it to push to the edge,</v>

1336
01:21:43.190 --> 01:21:48.190
<v Speaker 7>so I knew this new fondant harvest is the pacer gs and</v>

1337
01:21:54.100 --> 01:21:57.550
<v Speaker 7>perhaps a little more quiet people.</v>

1338
01:21:58.650 --> 01:22:01.350
<v Speaker 7>He wrote a book called Athletic Neuroscience.</v>

1339
01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:08.040
<v Speaker 7>He just started placer in separate places</v>

1340
01:22:10.470 --> 01:22:15.030
<v Speaker 7>and he didn't want to work on graphs and showing that in order to social life.</v>

1341
01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:20.700
<v Speaker 7>So far it hasn't been in compliance and here's the cool thing,</v>

1342
01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:29.120
<v Speaker 7>I guess in some instances postmodern to peak of the patriarch of purity,</v>

1343
01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:35.240
<v Speaker 7>so you've taken into combat menial ended up.</v>

1344
01:22:37.970 --> 01:22:40.970
<v Speaker 7>You give them an opportunity to apply</v>

1345
01:22:45.940 --> 01:22:48.540
<v Speaker 7>the next time that you bring to the same place.</v>

1346
01:22:49.290 --> 01:22:52.000
<v Speaker 7>You can measure how much work they'll open the floor to</v>

1347
01:22:55.050 --> 01:22:57.470
<v Speaker 7>say work or how hard.</v>

1348
01:22:57.630 --> 01:23:02.630
<v Speaker 7>I'll decide street spring to the panel and so we can get an estimate of the</v>

1349
01:23:02.990 --> 01:23:07.990
<v Speaker 7>nation because playing harder work and that's really hard.</v>

1350
01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:10.903
<v Speaker 7>So</v>

1351
01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:14.313
<v Speaker 7>one</v>

1352
01:23:16.450 --> 01:23:17.283
<v Speaker 7>issue.</v>

1353
01:23:17.690 --> 01:23:19.930
<v Speaker 7>So that's over the place.</v>

1354
01:23:21.370 --> 01:23:26.370
<v Speaker 7>Now let's grab a run rate is 10 percent the Hubbard and that really me people</v>

1355
01:23:34.100 --> 01:23:34.933
<v Speaker 7>getting</v>

1356
01:23:36.580 --> 01:23:37.413
<v Speaker 7>in</v>

1357
01:23:38.810 --> 01:23:39.643
<v Speaker 7>the parking lot,</v>

1358
01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:43.750
<v Speaker 7>so now really been little stuff.</v>

1359
01:23:43.751 --> 01:23:48.751
<v Speaker 7>If you think that moved for healing,</v>

1360
01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:02.350
<v Speaker 7>Marvin and he like</v>

1361
01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:09.680
<v Speaker 7>walked into the fear is going</v>

1362
01:24:11.930 --> 01:24:12.763
<v Speaker 7>to</v>

1363
01:24:18.410 --> 01:24:20.610
<v Speaker 8>and don't have kids.</v>

1364
01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:46.100
<v Speaker 7>Ten percent</v>

1365
01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:55.100
<v Speaker 7>skirt</v>

1366
01:25:06.010 --> 01:25:09.920
<v Speaker 7>because that one</v>

1367
01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:14.180
<v Speaker 7>little thing.</v>

1368
01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:21.650
<v Speaker 7>No wonder you're not psychopathic individuals wondering nicely,</v>

1369
01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:24.710
<v Speaker 7>they know</v>

1370
01:25:29.130 --> 01:25:34.130
<v Speaker 7>the rules for playing someone's 30 times or not the with playing someone</v>

1371
01:25:37.070 --> 01:25:42.070
<v Speaker 7>so plate repeatedly and what have you observed in your time together in</v>

1372
01:25:45.050 --> 01:25:45.650
<v Speaker 7>situations?</v>

1373
01:25:45.650 --> 01:25:50.650
<v Speaker 7>Little different little that comes bouncing ball.</v>

1374
01:25:51.850 --> 01:25:53.590
<v Speaker 7>So now is your number.</v>

1375
01:25:53.870 --> 01:25:54.703
<v Speaker 7>You lost.</v>

1376
01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:57.690
<v Speaker 7>You have to preach this complaint.</v>

1377
01:25:57.940 --> 01:25:59.760
<v Speaker 7>That's now big.</v>

1378
01:26:00.900 --> 01:26:01.733
<v Speaker 7>That's all.</v>

1379
01:26:15.010 --> 01:26:15.843
<v Speaker 7>Yep.</v>

1380
01:26:25.770 --> 01:26:26.920
<v Speaker 7>I don't think so.</v>

1381
01:26:28.290 --> 01:26:32.970
<v Speaker 7>To start studying my absolute miracle</v>

1382
01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:37.270
<v Speaker 7>that divergence doesn't.</v>

1383
01:26:37.890 --> 01:26:40.720
<v Speaker 7>He about to play even harass.</v>

1384
01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:43.020
<v Speaker 7>It's so basic.</v>

1385
01:26:43.150 --> 01:26:48.150
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't even human that is deeper than human.</v>

1386
01:26:48.750 --> 01:26:50.850
<v Speaker 7>It's real and it's epic.</v>

1387
01:26:50.890 --> 01:26:55.890
<v Speaker 7>It's interesting interaction and it's not just the that would seem so no.</v>

1388
01:26:57.020 --> 01:26:58.790
<v Speaker 7>Chimpanzees is blue,</v>

1389
01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:01.540
<v Speaker 7>pink and they're really,</v>

1390
01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:04.900
<v Speaker 7>really strong six times and sprawled with nail</v>

1391
01:27:07.990 --> 01:27:12.830
<v Speaker 7>fungus growing up and that happens is people have just passed.</v>

1392
01:27:13.990 --> 01:27:16.490
<v Speaker 7>It's like gym</v>

1393
01:27:20.350 --> 01:27:23.960
<v Speaker 7>and this is interesting girl,</v>

1394
01:27:24.370 --> 01:27:29.370
<v Speaker 7>and so getting discovered in the 1974 chips are tribal.</v>

1395
01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:31.473
<v Speaker 7>It improv over</v>

1396
01:27:33.690 --> 01:27:38.690
<v Speaker 7>territory and there's a river that's the payoff and our chimpanzees is habit.</v>

1397
01:27:40.900 --> 01:27:45.620
<v Speaker 7>The Kale or the chimpanzees and the juvenile patrol,</v>

1398
01:27:45.660 --> 01:27:49.620
<v Speaker 7>the perimeters is your support by fire.</v>

1399
01:27:49.900 --> 01:27:52.170
<v Speaker 7>For Jim to have them,</v>

1400
01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:55.890
<v Speaker 7>if they have a sense of quantity.</v>

1401
01:27:56.460 --> 01:27:57.610
<v Speaker 7>If five chairs</v>

1402
01:28:00.130 --> 01:28:00.963
<v Speaker 7>pits,</v>

1403
01:28:01.490 --> 01:28:06.140
<v Speaker 7>I actually knew that literally that's the CPG and gyms</v>

1404
01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:12.300
<v Speaker 7>and they will eat them alive.</v>

1405
01:28:13.510 --> 01:28:16.050
<v Speaker 7>So there isn't a lot of empathy.</v>

1406
01:28:19.250 --> 01:28:22.080
<v Speaker 7>Think about when you think about the</v>

1407
01:28:23.710 --> 01:28:27.030
<v Speaker 7>direction and you might think and like,</v>

1408
01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:27.870
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

1409
01:28:27.870 --> 01:28:30.910
<v Speaker 7>maybe it's your contents and it's something else.</v>

1410
01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:33.440
<v Speaker 7>Men,</v>

1411
01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:34.273
<v Speaker 7>he,</v>

1412
01:28:34.860 --> 01:28:35.960
<v Speaker 3>we'll start wondering very,</v>

1413
01:28:35.961 --> 01:28:36.794
<v Speaker 3>very rapidly</v>

1414
01:28:39.250 --> 01:28:40.550
<v Speaker 3>so you have to score.</v>

1415
01:28:40.620 --> 01:28:42.330
<v Speaker 3>You're absolutely</v>

1416
01:28:47.170 --> 01:28:48.070
<v Speaker 3>horrifying book.</v>

1417
01:28:48.130 --> 01:28:49.050
<v Speaker 3>So read it.</v>

1418
01:28:51.420 --> 01:28:52.253
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1419
01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:58.480
<v Speaker 7>just the gym's creatures and so let's look at a gym.</v>

1420
01:29:01.830 --> 01:29:02.663
<v Speaker 7>Basically</v>

1421
01:29:04.430 --> 01:29:05.263
<v Speaker 7>how</v>

1422
01:29:06.570 --> 01:29:11.570
<v Speaker 7>moving the ball in that gym and then my feet water to answer the most powerful</v>

1423
01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:14.953
<v Speaker 7>tyrannical</v>

1424
01:29:16.470 --> 01:29:19.020
<v Speaker 7>rule is how</v>

1425
01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:22.673
<v Speaker 7>that happens.</v>

1426
01:29:22.990 --> 01:29:25.920
<v Speaker 7>You know what happens to tyler juice?</v>

1427
01:29:26.550 --> 01:29:31.550
<v Speaker 7>They had an off day and to subordinates you each gang up to make a one and a</v>

1428
01:29:35.671 --> 01:29:36.850
<v Speaker 7>half super gimp</v>

1429
01:29:39.590 --> 01:29:40.423
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1430
01:29:40.710 --> 01:29:45.660
<v Speaker 7>So here's the gym tyrants need gloved hands,</v>

1431
01:29:46.620 --> 01:29:49.410
<v Speaker 7>so how do you never yourself as Jim,</v>

1432
01:29:49.740 --> 01:29:54.740
<v Speaker 7>if you want to be at the IRA and have preferential access to our announcer,</v>

1433
01:29:58.500 --> 01:30:03.480
<v Speaker 7>is engage in mutually reciprocal interactions with your peers.</v>

1434
01:30:04.190 --> 01:30:06.540
<v Speaker 7>The chance to stay here,</v>

1435
01:30:06.541 --> 01:30:07.374
<v Speaker 7>stay with me,</v>

1436
01:30:10.170 --> 01:30:14.940
<v Speaker 7>are the ones that have friends that are rolling through the permanent as Asian</v>

1437
01:30:14.940 --> 01:30:15.773
<v Speaker 7>Pacific,</v>

1438
01:30:16.690 --> 01:30:20.850
<v Speaker 7>but also be mailed and so have you been involved with chimps,</v>

1439
01:30:22.050 --> 01:30:23.640
<v Speaker 7>patriarchal utility,</v>

1440
01:30:23.850 --> 01:30:26.170
<v Speaker 7>a and beans locked</v>

1441
01:30:27.890 --> 01:30:28.723
<v Speaker 7>situation,</v>

1442
01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:32.690
<v Speaker 7>and so that speaks to a broader edtech is sacred,</v>

1443
01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:39.440
<v Speaker 7>that you can see this sort of thing throughout the Amazon thing is seems to</v>

1444
01:30:43.140 --> 01:30:46.420
<v Speaker 7>stabilize social as is now.</v>

1445
01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:49.010
<v Speaker 7>Maybe the simple avenue,</v>

1446
01:30:50.310 --> 01:30:51.270
<v Speaker 7>the Lord's prayer,</v>

1447
01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:57.480
<v Speaker 7>but we're doing simple and the idea that our higher radical patriarchy,</v>

1448
01:31:00.660 --> 01:31:05.460
<v Speaker 7>which is a word that nobody thinks her cheap camera reviews,</v>

1449
01:31:05.490 --> 01:31:10.490
<v Speaker 7>passion that comes from the idea that a that are hierarchies of radical which</v>

1450
01:31:12.061 --> 01:31:12.850
<v Speaker 7>they aren't,</v>

1451
01:31:12.850 --> 01:31:16.030
<v Speaker 7>and it can be done that way and being the most reliable,</v>

1452
01:31:16.200 --> 01:31:21.200
<v Speaker 7>nice to obtaining status to see how hard it is to be expressions of power and</v>

1453
01:31:21.591 --> 01:31:23.970
<v Speaker 7>both of those things are wrong.</v>

1454
01:31:25.020 --> 01:31:25.920
<v Speaker 7>They're wrong.</v>

1455
01:31:26.250 --> 01:31:26.880
<v Speaker 7>Nonetheless,</v>

1456
01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:30.220
<v Speaker 7>that's the theory of the flashes in the community.</v>

1457
01:31:30.830 --> 01:31:35.830
<v Speaker 7>Not that we haven't have to be honest that none of that's sufficiently</v>

1458
01:31:36.961 --> 01:31:41.280
<v Speaker 7>sophisticated is honestly super reasonable explanation of the work.</v>

1459
01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:42.873
<v Speaker 7>So we should.</v>

1460
01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:49.080
<v Speaker 7>All it's doing is dividing us into drive and it's not sold that.</v>

1461
01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:50.350
<v Speaker 7>It's hypothetical.</v>

1462
01:31:52.290 --> 01:31:53.123
<v Speaker 7>So</v>

1463
01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:03.993
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

1464
01:32:14.750 --> 01:32:17.740
<v Speaker 7>you're saying that's</v>

1465
01:32:19.900 --> 01:32:23.400
<v Speaker 7>not what life is.</v>

1466
01:32:23.750 --> 01:32:24.583
<v Speaker 7>Not</v>

1467
01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:27.910
<v Speaker 7>a sequence of the same.</v>

1468
01:32:28.020 --> 01:32:33.020
<v Speaker 7>These sequences on different things and if you want to be a successful player in</v>

1469
01:32:35.081 --> 01:32:40.081
<v Speaker 7>the set of multiple different days in Ohio or ethnic and you build subordinate,</v>

1470
01:32:42.500 --> 01:32:44.540
<v Speaker 7>not ethic to piggeries anyone game,</v>

1471
01:32:44.930 --> 01:32:45.763
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1472
01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:47.273
<v Speaker 7>so when you put</v>

1473
01:32:49.540 --> 01:32:54.540
<v Speaker 7>your victory each is and the reason that this is the best possible for you is</v>

1474
01:32:56.851 --> 01:32:59.520
<v Speaker 7>that you get invited a number of pain.</v>

1475
01:33:00.630 --> 01:33:01.463
<v Speaker 7>And so let's</v>

1476
01:33:05.470 --> 01:33:05.790
<v Speaker 7>see.</v>

1477
01:33:05.790 --> 01:33:10.790
<v Speaker 7>So let's say you want the best for task yourself.</v>

1478
01:33:13.170 --> 01:33:14.003
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1479
01:33:14.730 --> 01:33:19.620
<v Speaker 7>I'm not going to be around forever and they're going to have a lot of different</v>

1480
01:33:19.621 --> 01:33:20.454
<v Speaker 7>people,</v>

1481
01:33:21.420 --> 01:33:22.380
<v Speaker 7>single people,</v>

1482
01:33:22.980 --> 01:33:25.110
<v Speaker 7>individual groups with people,</v>

1483
01:33:25.500 --> 01:33:27.660
<v Speaker 7>children and adult.</v>

1484
01:33:28.110 --> 01:33:33.110
<v Speaker 7>And what they have to be prepared for is to interact with people in the best</v>

1485
01:33:33.590 --> 01:33:38.590
<v Speaker 7>offer for them to say you're to.</v>

1486
01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:40.313
<v Speaker 7>People said</v>

1487
01:33:42.940 --> 01:33:43.620
<v Speaker 7>it.</v>

1488
01:33:43.620 --> 01:33:48.620
<v Speaker 7>Be shared reading or not share in any technical deliverable.</v>

1489
01:33:49.060 --> 01:33:49.893
<v Speaker 7>Three,</v>

1490
01:33:50.010 --> 01:33:51.350
<v Speaker 7>it's hard to move here</v>

1491
01:33:54.830 --> 01:33:56.830
<v Speaker 7>for data sharing,</v>

1492
01:33:57.100 --> 01:34:02.100
<v Speaker 7>like learn like she's engaging with your parents and what is it?</v>

1493
01:34:04.350 --> 01:34:04.981
<v Speaker 7>What is it?</v>

1494
01:34:04.981 --> 01:34:07.200
<v Speaker 7>It's your job when you're socializing.</v>

1495
01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:12.360
<v Speaker 7>A child was to before bed is for me is the attitude of the time.</v>

1496
01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:19.480
<v Speaker 7>Therefore they might give up as it isn't going to happen in the literature on</v>

1497
01:34:19.620 --> 01:34:20.560
<v Speaker 7>antisocial behavior.</v>

1498
01:34:20.690 --> 01:34:22.800
<v Speaker 7>Children is crystal clear on this point.</v>

1499
01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:25.500
<v Speaker 7>If your child was not for</v>

1500
01:34:27.700 --> 01:34:28.533
<v Speaker 7>sale,</v>

1501
01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:30.913
<v Speaker 7>beautiful.</v>

1502
01:34:31.110 --> 01:34:35.240
<v Speaker 7>After the psychologists and sociologists</v>

1503
01:34:36.900 --> 01:34:41.900
<v Speaker 7>have tried for like six days to figure out are anti social behavior in older</v>

1504
01:34:43.141 --> 01:34:46.380
<v Speaker 7>children and adolescents show they have managed</v>

1505
01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:50.920
<v Speaker 7>or is pushing</v>

1506
01:34:53.770 --> 01:34:57.050
<v Speaker 7>up your job person that other children want to play,</v>

1507
01:34:58.110 --> 01:34:59.610
<v Speaker 7>the reason you want</v>

1508
01:35:02.690 --> 01:35:03.523
<v Speaker 7>primary</v>

1509
01:35:05.370 --> 01:35:07.090
<v Speaker 7>and so if your children are accepted,</v>

1510
01:35:08.150 --> 01:35:10.490
<v Speaker 7>then you're on the way with other children,</v>

1511
01:35:10.510 --> 01:35:13.110
<v Speaker 7>with a parent,</v>

1512
01:35:13.540 --> 01:35:16.280
<v Speaker 7>but I'm easy to find there is represented</v>

1513
01:35:18.410 --> 01:35:18.990
<v Speaker 7>and they start.</v>

1514
01:35:18.990 --> 01:35:20.520
<v Speaker 7>You reciprocate reciprocally,</v>

1515
01:35:20.660 --> 01:35:22.890
<v Speaker 7>socialize quite.</v>

1516
01:35:23.170 --> 01:35:27.350
<v Speaker 7>It's a little bit better job of really played companions.</v>

1517
01:35:28.220 --> 01:35:32.270
<v Speaker 7>Then you could just stand back and you have to be around when something breaks</v>

1518
01:35:32.271 --> 01:35:34.010
<v Speaker 7>down and the system doesn't work.</v>

1519
01:35:34.230 --> 01:35:35.560
<v Speaker 7>When you haven't been here as a resource,</v>

1520
01:35:35.980 --> 01:35:39.470
<v Speaker 7>but basically for first of all it was going say,</v>

1521
01:35:39.630 --> 01:35:40.170
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1522
01:35:40.170 --> 01:35:45.170
<v Speaker 7>you know what is so glad and have asked for it,</v>

1523
01:35:49.190 --> 01:35:54.190
<v Speaker 7>so you're trying to make your child's maximum weight on the world made up of a</v>

1524
01:35:57.261 --> 01:36:02.261
<v Speaker 7>sequence of higher parents score and so if you want the child could be the sort</v>

1525
01:36:03.711 --> 01:36:08.710
<v Speaker 7>of person who's invited to participate in what our higher self</v>

1526
01:36:10.220 --> 01:36:13.610
<v Speaker 7>and how much the child might do that.</v>

1527
01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:14.220
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1528
01:36:14.220 --> 01:36:19.220
<v Speaker 7>they have two separate will take turns right?</v>

1529
01:36:20.900 --> 01:36:23.240
<v Speaker 7>You have to find out what other people want to be.</v>

1530
01:36:23.330 --> 01:36:28.330
<v Speaker 7>They want to play too sophisticated ethical rules before know if you're playing.</v>

1531
01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:35.450
<v Speaker 7>If they are planning for what are they like?</v>

1532
01:36:35.870 --> 01:36:37.490
<v Speaker 7>If somebody doesn't follow the airplane,</v>

1533
01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:40.180
<v Speaker 7>one and emotional person,</v>

1534
01:36:40.190 --> 01:36:45.190
<v Speaker 7>they revert to the behavior of the little two year old temper tantrum diversity.</v>

1535
01:36:46.220 --> 01:36:48.920
<v Speaker 7>Here's the crash on the floor.</v>

1536
01:36:49.490 --> 01:36:52.250
<v Speaker 7>It's not funny because we played.</v>

1537
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:54.620
<v Speaker 7>If you don't lose them nice and no one else.</v>

1538
01:36:54.621 --> 01:36:57.950
<v Speaker 7>Different winds to help with someone like that</v>

1539
01:36:59.810 --> 01:37:04.810
<v Speaker 7>and that's all know any stamps has been put up with that.</v>

1540
01:37:06.700 --> 01:37:11.700
<v Speaker 7>Like if they find out their potential partner is a two year old,</v>

1541
01:37:13.350 --> 01:37:14.340
<v Speaker 7>he's war,</v>

1542
01:37:14.580 --> 01:37:18.630
<v Speaker 7>they just stop and go find another gig because that's exactly what happened.</v>

1543
01:37:19.150 --> 01:37:24.150
<v Speaker 7>Want that again and make sure that they're better to never let them loose in</v>

1544
01:37:25.721 --> 01:37:26.554
<v Speaker 7>anything.</v>

1545
01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:28.580
<v Speaker 7>They don't get any prior.</v>

1546
01:37:28.710 --> 01:37:28.911
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1547
01:37:28.911 --> 01:37:29.890
<v Speaker 7>I want it</v>

1548
01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:32.273
<v Speaker 7>long.</v>

1549
01:37:32.660 --> 01:37:33.493
<v Speaker 7>You don't want it.</v>

1550
01:37:33.650 --> 01:37:37.460
<v Speaker 7>You don't like your kid is unsophisticated manner.</v>

1551
01:37:37.970 --> 01:37:41.420
<v Speaker 7>That's not the same thing on the other.</v>

1552
01:37:41.670 --> 01:37:43.240
<v Speaker 7>Had the</v>

1553
01:37:45.090 --> 01:37:46.500
<v Speaker 7>back back.</v>

1554
01:37:46.910 --> 01:37:47.780
<v Speaker 7>You shouldn't be no.</v>

1555
01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:56.993
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

1556
01:37:57.240 --> 01:37:58.740
<v Speaker 7>So you might take apart.</v>

1557
01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:00.473
<v Speaker 7>What does it mean?</v>

1558
01:38:03.310 --> 01:38:04.143
<v Speaker 7>Superbowl.</v>

1559
01:38:04.950 --> 01:38:07.310
<v Speaker 7>Repeat again.</v>

1560
01:38:22.270 --> 01:38:24.690
<v Speaker 7>And then walk down.</v>

1561
01:38:29.790 --> 01:38:30.623
<v Speaker 7>It was</v>

1562
01:38:32.120 --> 01:38:36.360
<v Speaker 7>already built into the interaction that we all are.</v>

1563
01:38:37.080 --> 01:38:37.913
<v Speaker 7>What are we getting?</v>

1564
01:38:38.050 --> 01:38:40.040
<v Speaker 7>Really understand her though.</v>

1565
01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:45.370
<v Speaker 7>So imagine you're watching a wall</v>

1566
01:38:47.150 --> 01:38:49.270
<v Speaker 7>to that</v>

1567
01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:52.593
<v Speaker 7>way.</v>

1568
01:38:53.340 --> 01:38:53.900
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

1569
01:38:53.900 --> 01:38:54.733
<v Speaker 7>And so.</v>

1570
01:38:54.830 --> 01:38:55.663
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

1571
01:38:58.870 --> 01:38:59.703
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

1572
01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:01.993
<v Speaker 7>that's fine.</v>

1573
01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:06.300
<v Speaker 7>Why did you pass</v>

1574
01:39:10.050 --> 01:39:12.210
<v Speaker 7>out now</v>

1575
01:39:17.770 --> 01:39:18.700
<v Speaker 7>the reason</v>

1576
01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:24.840
<v Speaker 7>why they want to</v>

1577
01:39:26.540 --> 01:39:27.900
<v Speaker 7>pass down until</v>

1578
01:39:32.590 --> 01:39:33.860
<v Speaker 7>they don't want to find it because</v>

1579
01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:41.640
<v Speaker 7>that</v>

1580
01:39:51.820 --> 01:39:52.653
<v Speaker 7>way</v>

1581
01:39:55.650 --> 01:39:56.483
<v Speaker 7>it's</v>

1582
01:39:58.710 --> 01:39:59.550
<v Speaker 7>written down.</v>

1583
01:40:02.120 --> 01:40:02.953
<v Speaker 7>So</v>

1584
01:40:08.390 --> 01:40:13.390
<v Speaker 7>what happens if the wall was where all the breath,</v>

1585
01:40:17.060 --> 01:40:19.140
<v Speaker 7>the whole</v>

1586
01:40:27.350 --> 01:40:28.183
<v Speaker 7>why</v>

1587
01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:32.320
<v Speaker 7>people weren't</v>

1588
01:40:33.830 --> 01:40:36.140
<v Speaker 7>allowed to eat</v>

1589
01:40:43.370 --> 01:40:46.710
<v Speaker 7>and so basically say is</v>

1590
01:40:48.310 --> 01:40:49.870
<v Speaker 7>not useful.</v>

1591
01:40:51.040 --> 01:40:51.620
<v Speaker 7>Useless.</v>

1592
01:40:51.620 --> 01:40:52.453
<v Speaker 7>Most.</v>

1593
01:40:56.360 --> 01:40:57.193
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1594
01:41:00.420 --> 01:41:01.253
<v Speaker 7>So</v>

1595
01:41:03.070 --> 01:41:05.650
<v Speaker 7>I know what I will</v>

1596
01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:09.953
<v Speaker 7>do</v>

1597
01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:16.030
<v Speaker 7>my status,</v>

1598
01:41:16.570 --> 01:41:19.480
<v Speaker 7>and he gets ball hunting the next day.</v>

1599
01:41:20.180 --> 01:41:20.951
<v Speaker 7>So you might think,</v>

1600
01:41:20.951 --> 01:41:25.951
<v Speaker 7>well let's proceed with the loyalty that is don't care this next year of the</v>

1601
01:41:30.370 --> 01:41:32.670
<v Speaker 7>preacher that's wrong.</v>

1602
01:41:32.980 --> 01:41:33.880
<v Speaker 7>And then you might say,</v>

1603
01:41:33.881 --> 01:41:37.190
<v Speaker 7>well that's the rule that will call it that strong,</v>

1604
01:41:39.330 --> 01:41:40.320
<v Speaker 7>have rules.</v>

1605
01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:43.633
<v Speaker 7>The</v>

1606
01:41:44.890 --> 01:41:47.050
<v Speaker 7>rule say actually</v>

1607
01:41:49.670 --> 01:41:51.370
<v Speaker 7>what they're doing with the rules.</v>

1608
01:41:52.190 --> 01:41:53.920
<v Speaker 7>That's how we got our rules.</v>

1609
01:41:55.090 --> 01:41:58.170
<v Speaker 7>That's how our rules we have to know.</v>

1610
01:42:00.230 --> 01:42:04.180
<v Speaker 7>And then in walks and then in stories.</v>

1611
01:42:04.870 --> 01:42:06.620
<v Speaker 7>That's what our religious stories are,</v>

1612
01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:12.080
<v Speaker 7>the consequences as watching what the academic and then transporting that into</v>

1613
01:42:13.300 --> 01:42:18.300
<v Speaker 7>the store and continue on that story adds to the story of good decisions.</v>

1614
01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:19.713
<v Speaker 7>Let's say</v>

1615
01:42:21.030 --> 01:42:22.740
<v Speaker 7>why do you want to watch that sport?</v>

1616
01:42:22.900 --> 01:42:26.980
<v Speaker 7>Because you want to know how to at the descended from the gates and that's what</v>

1617
01:42:26.981 --> 01:42:31.981
<v Speaker 7>that story and as the movies or books or religious narratives are about,</v>

1618
01:42:32.950 --> 01:42:37.950
<v Speaker 7>that's where everything is at a rigorous level and the reason is because that's</v>

1619
01:42:39.581 --> 01:42:44.190
<v Speaker 7>what the world is native and that's what we need to know so that he might be.</v>

1620
01:42:44.430 --> 01:42:45.770
<v Speaker 7>So here's something to think about.</v>

1621
01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:49.330
<v Speaker 7>I'll give you the symbolic participation,</v>

1622
01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:55.320
<v Speaker 7>so there's this idea of Christianity not talking about this from a religious</v>

1623
01:42:55.361 --> 01:42:56.194
<v Speaker 7>perspective.</v>

1624
01:42:57.050 --> 01:42:59.120
<v Speaker 7>I'm talking about this Andrew,</v>

1625
01:42:59.160 --> 01:42:59.993
<v Speaker 7>the last</v>

1626
01:43:02.340 --> 01:43:03.173
<v Speaker 7>four games,</v>

1627
01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:13.360
<v Speaker 7>so there's this idea of in Christ he is the king of pain.</v>

1628
01:43:16.630 --> 01:43:21.630
<v Speaker 7>He's running to take that part so that you have a higher whatever it is and</v>

1629
01:43:22.391 --> 01:43:23.480
<v Speaker 7>they're so unhappy to talk,</v>

1630
01:43:24.710 --> 01:43:27.110
<v Speaker 7>so that's the first half is necessary.</v>

1631
01:43:27.300 --> 01:43:32.300
<v Speaker 7>The problem with that higher mission to tell a story about how the best talking</v>

1632
01:43:34.120 --> 01:43:34.953
<v Speaker 7>to your team,</v>

1633
01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:37.440
<v Speaker 7>like what we were doing the best.</v>

1634
01:43:37.660 --> 01:43:41.000
<v Speaker 7>I know you're over here,</v>

1635
01:43:42.250 --> 01:43:44.410
<v Speaker 7>maybe it's hockey,</v>

1636
01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:45.513
<v Speaker 7>soccer,</v>

1637
01:43:45.730 --> 01:43:46.563
<v Speaker 7>plumbing,</v>

1638
01:43:46.570 --> 01:43:47.403
<v Speaker 7>law,</v>

1639
01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:48.393
<v Speaker 7>business.</v>

1640
01:43:48.510 --> 01:43:53.510
<v Speaker 7>Our goals are and the thing that's after 12</v>

1641
01:43:55.480 --> 01:43:56.313
<v Speaker 7>out</v>

1642
01:43:57.360 --> 01:44:02.360
<v Speaker 7>as something that's whatever is the department across of things that are at the</v>

1643
01:44:03.510 --> 01:44:04.343
<v Speaker 7>park.</v>

1644
01:44:05.500 --> 01:44:06.910
<v Speaker 7>This is</v>

1645
01:44:08.610 --> 01:44:12.430
<v Speaker 7>normal and he wanted to steal some character to</v>

1646
01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:18.040
<v Speaker 7>character and you want a good good.</v>

1647
01:44:18.050 --> 01:44:18.780
<v Speaker 7>Sheriff says,</v>

1648
01:44:18.780 --> 01:44:23.780
<v Speaker 7>if you don't want to just tell a story about some guy named</v>

1649
01:44:26.510 --> 01:44:27.343
<v Speaker 7>John.</v>

1650
01:44:27.680 --> 01:44:32.680
<v Speaker 7>Woke up at six and then he said four times in 20 times</v>

1651
01:44:35.450 --> 01:44:36.740
<v Speaker 7>and walked into the bathroom.</v>

1652
01:44:40.540 --> 01:44:43.580
<v Speaker 7>You know how to move your mouth off.</v>

1653
01:44:47.210 --> 01:44:48.043
<v Speaker 7>Dysplasia.</v>

1654
01:44:51.030 --> 01:44:51.863
<v Speaker 7>Good</v>

1655
01:44:52.990 --> 01:44:53.823
<v Speaker 7>ingredients,</v>

1656
01:44:53.950 --> 01:44:56.960
<v Speaker 7>good across a bunch of people and you want him to abstract.</v>

1657
01:44:56.980 --> 01:44:58.820
<v Speaker 7>The summons was evil.</v>

1658
01:44:59.150 --> 01:45:01.510
<v Speaker 7>This is directly across a bunch of evil character.</v>

1659
01:45:03.750 --> 01:45:07.010
<v Speaker 7>Good character is the bigger than life.</v>

1660
01:45:07.370 --> 01:45:08.360
<v Speaker 7>One thing I</v>

1661
01:45:10.890 --> 01:45:11.810
<v Speaker 7>learned from</v>

1662
01:45:14.930 --> 01:45:18.850
<v Speaker 7>the entire Monday her,</v>

1663
01:45:19.530 --> 01:45:24.530
<v Speaker 7>when you picked up the whole entire group into groups of candidates</v>

1664
01:45:26.310 --> 01:45:27.440
<v Speaker 7>who people,</v>

1665
01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:28.761
<v Speaker 7>then you say,</v>

1666
01:45:28.761 --> 01:45:28.941
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1667
01:45:28.941 --> 01:45:33.941
<v Speaker 7>we're going to average across most app with the opposite Google Person Dato's</v>

1668
01:45:35.331 --> 01:45:36.230
<v Speaker 7>goals 10.</v>

1669
01:45:38.650 --> 01:45:39.820
<v Speaker 7>Let's say there are thousands</v>

1670
01:45:41.330 --> 01:45:43.110
<v Speaker 7>out of anything.</v>

1671
01:45:43.260 --> 01:45:45.630
<v Speaker 7>I'm just asking what the still images.</v>

1672
01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:48.153
<v Speaker 7>Maybe get</v>

1673
01:45:50.110 --> 01:45:50.943
<v Speaker 7>one.</v>

1674
01:45:51.330 --> 01:45:52.330
<v Speaker 7>What that one is,</v>

1675
01:45:52.450 --> 01:45:55.450
<v Speaker 7>what's applicable across the entire set and ask people.</v>

1676
01:45:56.800 --> 01:45:58.050
<v Speaker 7>That's a design thing.</v>

1677
01:46:00.380 --> 01:46:05.380
<v Speaker 7>That's what it is and so the Christian is Christ paid me be diesel vehicles.</v>

1678
01:46:08.841 --> 01:46:13.730
<v Speaker 7>Across the cross is the place where suffering is accepted.</v>

1679
01:46:14.290 --> 01:46:16.940
<v Speaker 7>The Cross is the dove and that's the Scott,</v>

1680
01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:19.010
<v Speaker 7>so there's an idea</v>

1681
01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:25.490
<v Speaker 7>of the cross earth is the center of the universe.</v>

1682
01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:30.230
<v Speaker 7>It's look goal and you see this bigger staring down at you.</v>

1683
01:46:30.620 --> 01:46:34.850
<v Speaker 7>That's the thing and that's how it behave in the world.</v>

1684
01:46:35.930 --> 01:46:40.150
<v Speaker 7>That's what that represents and faithful with.</v>

1685
01:46:40.250 --> 01:46:40.820
<v Speaker 7>Nice.</v>

1686
01:46:40.820 --> 01:46:40.971
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1687
01:46:40.971 --> 01:46:45.971
<v Speaker 7>here's a way of unpacking this is associated associated with use of how is the</v>

1688
01:46:48.220 --> 01:46:49.053
<v Speaker 7>data.</v>

1689
01:46:58.000 --> 01:46:58.833
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1690
01:47:04.650 --> 01:47:05.483
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1691
01:47:08.090 --> 01:47:08.923
<v Speaker 7>we</v>

1692
01:47:18.700 --> 01:47:23.700
<v Speaker 7>certainly not say that the way to the wall is our</v>

1693
01:47:26.700 --> 01:47:27.533
<v Speaker 7>resource.</v>

1694
01:47:30.500 --> 01:47:33.720
<v Speaker 7>I'm not even saying that a little bit</v>

1695
01:47:35.890 --> 01:47:36.150
<v Speaker 7>say,</v>

1696
01:47:36.150 --> 01:47:36.983
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1697
01:47:38.670 --> 01:47:41.410
<v Speaker 7>isn't that a clerical staff is,</v>

1698
01:47:42.390 --> 01:47:43.780
<v Speaker 7>well actually no,</v>

1699
01:47:56.750 --> 01:47:58.580
<v Speaker 7>and I'm ready for</v>

1700
01:48:05.190 --> 01:48:06.023
<v Speaker 7>this.</v>

1701
01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:08.720
<v Speaker 7>This is what happens</v>

1702
01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:14.090
<v Speaker 7>with this stance is I'm willing to take less.</v>

1703
01:48:14.180 --> 01:48:17.100
<v Speaker 7>The world throws at me right now.</v>

1704
01:48:21.420 --> 01:48:22.253
<v Speaker 7>That's</v>

1705
01:48:28.130 --> 01:48:33.130
<v Speaker 7>what's scaring the hell off the street right here with stances.</v>

1706
01:48:40.580 --> 01:48:41.413
<v Speaker 7>While</v>

1707
01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:43.393
<v Speaker 7>volunteering</v>

1708
01:48:48.100 --> 01:48:51.830
<v Speaker 7>represents willingness to take on.</v>

1709
01:48:55.330 --> 01:48:56.163
<v Speaker 7>The</v>

1710
01:48:58.750 --> 01:49:03.750
<v Speaker 7>best possible strategies have been successful</v>

1711
01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:09.490
<v Speaker 7>is the fact that we both</v>

1712
01:49:11.230 --> 01:49:12.063
<v Speaker 7>sat down</v>

1713
01:49:13.870 --> 01:49:14.703
<v Speaker 7>and</v>

1714
01:49:17.540 --> 01:49:18.820
<v Speaker 7>you see</v>

1715
01:49:21.900 --> 01:49:22.733
<v Speaker 7>these.</v>

1716
01:49:24.580 --> 01:49:29.540
<v Speaker 7>They will be world will be</v>

1717
01:49:31.160 --> 01:49:31.993
<v Speaker 7>more</v>

1718
01:49:36.970 --> 01:49:37.803
<v Speaker 7>work.</v>

1719
01:49:39.060 --> 01:49:40.530
<v Speaker 7>That's why I don't know.</v>

1720
01:49:40.740 --> 01:49:41.573
<v Speaker 7>That's.</v>

1721
01:49:41.610 --> 01:49:42.720
<v Speaker 7>That's great.</v>

1722
01:49:43.020 --> 01:49:48.020
<v Speaker 7>That's it's the same place center you same idea.</v>

1723
01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:51.940
<v Speaker 7>You're secure.</v>

1724
01:49:51.970 --> 01:49:56.970
<v Speaker 7>That's you have tradition and the the civilization behind you and you have one</v>

1725
01:49:59.110 --> 01:49:59.943
<v Speaker 7>day off.</v>

1726
01:50:00.020 --> 01:50:00.920
<v Speaker 7>That's not enough</v>

1727
01:50:02.460 --> 01:50:05.290
<v Speaker 7>and against the is nice</v>

1728
01:50:07.010 --> 01:50:11.080
<v Speaker 7>and you can use that as a guy and it's an eight neurological instincts.</v>

1729
01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:16.560
<v Speaker 7>It's not something as denominator most real thing or is far as I can tell and</v>

1730
01:50:17.700 --> 01:50:19.210
<v Speaker 7>associated with certain</v>

1731
01:50:20.910 --> 01:50:21.780
<v Speaker 7>ventures,</v>

1732
01:50:23.130 --> 01:50:24.910
<v Speaker 7>courageously unknown.</v>

1733
01:50:25.380 --> 01:50:27.070
<v Speaker 7>Book yourself on the line.</v>

1734
01:50:27.780 --> 01:50:32.380
<v Speaker 7>He mentioned risk yourself ball.</v>

1735
01:50:32.450 --> 01:50:34.660
<v Speaker 7>Apparently you haven't any</v>

1736
01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:38.760
<v Speaker 7>great because you're in it's own way.</v>

1737
01:50:39.410 --> 01:50:41.290
<v Speaker 7>There's no else that isn't death.</v>

1738
01:50:43.420 --> 01:50:43.960
<v Speaker 7>Exactly.</v>

1739
01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:48.960
<v Speaker 7>Would be able to speeding up what the candidate is.</v>

1740
01:50:49.620 --> 01:50:53.390
<v Speaker 7>Choose how to confirm it,</v>

1741
01:50:53.410 --> 01:50:55.380
<v Speaker 7>so rule one is the standard experience.</v>

1742
01:50:55.430 --> 01:50:56.340
<v Speaker 7>He told us that,</v>

1743
01:50:56.800 --> 01:51:00.070
<v Speaker 7>and it has thing so amazing.</v>

1744
01:51:00.970 --> 01:51:05.970
<v Speaker 7>This is a kind of ultimate reality idea.</v>

1745
01:51:06.910 --> 01:51:08.460
<v Speaker 7>Position yourself properly.</v>

1746
01:51:09.080 --> 01:51:09.913
<v Speaker 7>You might say,</v>

1747
01:51:11.080 --> 01:51:11.913
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1748
01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:13.233
<v Speaker 7>let's</v>

1749
01:51:14.450 --> 01:51:16.120
<v Speaker 7>make her hurt estimates in person,</v>

1750
01:51:17.030 --> 01:51:17.863
<v Speaker 7>or</v>

1751
01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.040
<v Speaker 7>then you say,</v>

1752
01:51:21.390 --> 01:51:21.550
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1753
01:51:21.550 --> 01:51:23.560
<v Speaker 7>what's the fundamental realities of life?</v>

1754
01:51:23.590 --> 01:51:23.891
<v Speaker 7>And say,</v>

1755
01:51:23.891 --> 01:51:24.071
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1756
01:51:24.071 --> 01:51:25.460
<v Speaker 7>the suffering and the level</v>

1757
01:51:29.350 --> 01:51:31.240
<v Speaker 7>two course</v>

1758
01:51:33.330 --> 01:51:34.163
<v Speaker 7>black,</v>

1759
01:51:34.900 --> 01:51:36.490
<v Speaker 7>it'll be true.</v>

1760
01:51:36.920 --> 01:51:37.860
<v Speaker 7>It's not.</v>

1761
01:51:38.050 --> 01:51:39.420
<v Speaker 7>It's not the finance,</v>

1762
01:51:41.530 --> 01:51:46.530
<v Speaker 7>despite the fact that that's the ability of the human spirits and prevail is</v>

1763
01:51:47.711 --> 01:51:49.850
<v Speaker 7>more powerful than people.</v>

1764
01:51:54.250 --> 01:51:55.360
<v Speaker 7>That's the fruit.</v>

1765
01:51:55.900 --> 01:51:58.300
<v Speaker 7>You know that first of all,</v>

1766
01:51:58.430 --> 01:52:00.610
<v Speaker 7>know that because you're ashamed that</v>

1767
01:52:03.040 --> 01:52:05.060
<v Speaker 7>you don't have people learn.</v>

1768
01:52:05.560 --> 01:52:10.560
<v Speaker 7>Some people who manifests courage is dire straits and you know what?</v>

1769
01:52:10.961 --> 01:52:11.500
<v Speaker 7>I've lost.</v>

1770
01:52:11.500 --> 01:52:14.530
<v Speaker 7>Just need people like that and you're not like that.</v>

1771
01:52:14.890 --> 01:52:15.190
<v Speaker 7>They,</v>

1772
01:52:15.190 --> 01:52:20.190
<v Speaker 7>she speaks to the deep as possible and they know what we can be and you don't do</v>

1773
01:52:21.931 --> 01:52:22.100
<v Speaker 7>it.</v>

1774
01:52:22.100 --> 01:52:24.110
<v Speaker 7>You see people in situations,</v>

1775
01:52:24.350 --> 01:52:27.360
<v Speaker 7>but it's so difficult that it's truly a miracle.</v>

1776
01:52:27.450 --> 01:52:28.480
<v Speaker 7>It can condense,</v>

1777
01:52:29.240 --> 01:52:32.440
<v Speaker 7>nor I think of people who work in beautiful.</v>

1778
01:52:32.530 --> 01:52:33.670
<v Speaker 7>That's a good example.</v>

1779
01:52:33.880 --> 01:52:34.780
<v Speaker 7>That's hard,</v>

1780
01:52:35.560 --> 01:52:36.240
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1781
01:52:36.240 --> 01:52:41.000
<v Speaker 7>That's in brief every day and it's not something that uses voice.</v>

1782
01:52:41.500 --> 01:52:42.610
<v Speaker 7>It's like it's right there.</v>

1783
01:52:42.611 --> 01:52:44.290
<v Speaker 7>It's just really impossible to be</v>

1784
01:52:51.080 --> 01:52:51.913
<v Speaker 7>and</v>

1785
01:52:53.450 --> 01:52:54.930
<v Speaker 7>sleep all the time.</v>

1786
01:53:03.050 --> 01:53:03.883
<v Speaker 7>Freedom</v>

1787
01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:08.513
<v Speaker 7>that</v>

1788
01:53:10.060 --> 01:53:11.310
<v Speaker 7>Gypsy told that</v>

1789
01:53:14.300 --> 01:53:15.133
<v Speaker 7>after</v>

1790
01:53:17.440 --> 01:53:20.750
<v Speaker 7>childbirth is something I've never seen anyone else</v>

1791
01:53:27.580 --> 01:53:29.110
<v Speaker 7>unless you been</v>

1792
01:53:35.420 --> 01:53:37.530
<v Speaker 7>exposed to</v>

1793
01:53:39.530 --> 01:53:40.850
<v Speaker 7>what they're afraid of</v>

1794
01:53:42.700 --> 01:53:43.533
<v Speaker 7>children,</v>

1795
01:53:44.820 --> 01:53:45.730
<v Speaker 7>the children,</v>

1796
01:53:46.580 --> 01:53:47.840
<v Speaker 7>if that makes me stronger,</v>

1797
01:53:50.030 --> 01:53:51.840
<v Speaker 7>if you have post traumatic stress,</v>

1798
01:53:52.010 --> 01:53:57.010
<v Speaker 7>the victim of sexual assault by a stream disorder,</v>

1799
01:54:00.040 --> 01:54:04.610
<v Speaker 7>the most effective treatment is to get you to relive the experience as much as</v>

1800
01:54:05.060 --> 01:54:06.510
<v Speaker 7>possible out of experience,</v>

1801
01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:11.750
<v Speaker 7>and if you do that</v>

1802
01:54:14.930 --> 01:54:18.410
<v Speaker 7>can be buried in the world statement and</v>

1803
01:54:20.820 --> 01:54:22.430
<v Speaker 7>it sounds as avoiding something.</v>

1804
01:54:23.040 --> 01:54:23.873
<v Speaker 7>Voiding.</v>

1805
01:54:24.530 --> 01:54:29.530
<v Speaker 7>Break it into manageable pieces and how it therapy expose themselves to it and</v>

1806
01:54:29.930 --> 01:54:32.560
<v Speaker 7>be able to hear and that's the dragon.</v>

1807
01:54:32.860 --> 01:54:34.200
<v Speaker 7>In the clinical practice,</v>

1808
01:54:35.690 --> 01:54:37.120
<v Speaker 7>what do you most want to?</v>

1809
01:54:37.270 --> 01:54:42.270
<v Speaker 7>What most people would probably go right to help the state.</v>

1810
01:54:44.150 --> 01:54:47.290
<v Speaker 7>So she was three and I thought</v>

1811
01:54:51.020 --> 01:54:51.853
<v Speaker 7>was</v>

1812
01:54:53.270 --> 01:54:54.970
<v Speaker 7>very neat</v>

1813
01:54:56.650 --> 01:54:57.483
<v Speaker 7>story,</v>

1814
01:54:59.210 --> 01:55:00.420
<v Speaker 7>a stroke,</v>

1815
01:55:01.010 --> 01:55:01.843
<v Speaker 7>Rehab.</v>

1816
01:55:03.020 --> 01:55:03.853
<v Speaker 7>Anyways,</v>

1817
01:55:05.060 --> 01:55:05.481
<v Speaker 7>I said,</v>

1818
01:55:05.481 --> 01:55:05.631
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1819
01:55:05.631 --> 01:55:06.464
<v Speaker 7>I can</v>

1820
01:55:07.880 --> 01:55:09.930
<v Speaker 7>play it for awhile.</v>

1821
01:55:10.120 --> 01:55:10.953
<v Speaker 7>I'm not,</v>

1822
01:55:11.090 --> 01:55:12.950
<v Speaker 7>you come up with the rural from.</v>

1823
01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:14.520
<v Speaker 7>So uh,</v>

1824
01:55:14.710 --> 01:55:16.040
<v Speaker 7>he came back and she said,</v>

1825
01:55:16.310 --> 01:55:18.250
<v Speaker 7>I want to see an involving</v>

1826
01:55:25.730 --> 01:55:26.563
<v Speaker 7>is.</v>

1827
01:55:28.850 --> 01:55:30.480
<v Speaker 7>And she had his</v>

1828
01:55:31.980 --> 01:55:32.410
<v Speaker 7>story.</v>

1829
01:55:32.410 --> 01:55:33.010
<v Speaker 7>He said,</v>

1830
01:55:33.010 --> 01:55:33.843
<v Speaker 7>no problem.</v>

1831
01:55:41.740 --> 01:55:42.270
<v Speaker 7>She was very,</v>

1832
01:55:42.270 --> 01:55:43.103
<v Speaker 7>very imperative.</v>

1833
01:55:48.300 --> 01:55:50.120
<v Speaker 7>Not New.</v>

1834
01:55:51.190 --> 01:55:52.660
<v Speaker 7>Any problems we,</v>

1835
01:55:53.770 --> 01:55:54.603
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1836
01:55:54.920 --> 01:55:57.590
<v Speaker 7>art and it's your ground.</v>

1837
01:55:58.490 --> 01:56:03.490
<v Speaker 7>I'll take law that's that need instead of going to be useful for them and error</v>

1838
01:56:08.040 --> 01:56:11.460
<v Speaker 7>experience with a new appreciation for life.</v>

1839
01:56:12.370 --> 01:56:13.203
<v Speaker 7>Well</v>

1840
01:56:14.540 --> 01:56:16.050
<v Speaker 7>that would come to the library.</v>

1841
01:56:16.540 --> 01:56:18.080
<v Speaker 7>It seems like dogs.</v>

1842
01:56:18.290 --> 01:56:21.910
<v Speaker 7>So with this room and watched this,</v>

1843
01:56:23.150 --> 01:56:28.150
<v Speaker 7>I'm apt to move from the smaller three person operation and got her</v>

1844
01:56:34.260 --> 01:56:35.093
<v Speaker 7>house.</v>

1845
01:56:35.130 --> 01:56:37.030
<v Speaker 7>She is inside.</v>

1846
01:56:38.030 --> 01:56:41.190
<v Speaker 7>I got here and I certainly can't.</v>

1847
01:56:43.850 --> 01:56:44.683
<v Speaker 7>She</v>

1848
01:56:45.610 --> 01:56:46.710
<v Speaker 7>take them all black.</v>

1849
01:56:49.580 --> 01:56:50.413
<v Speaker 7>And then</v>

1850
01:56:53.150 --> 01:56:56.950
<v Speaker 7>she was spending more time watching less tiny way I think.</v>

1851
01:56:56.960 --> 01:56:59.110
<v Speaker 7>Well she was fine because now watch it.</v>

1852
01:56:59.790 --> 01:57:01.480
<v Speaker 7>At some point you asked that you could,</v>

1853
01:57:01.800 --> 01:57:05.840
<v Speaker 7>even if what she did it,</v>

1854
01:57:07.050 --> 01:57:08.960
<v Speaker 7>she was like,</v>

1855
01:57:11.250 --> 01:57:11.700
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1856
01:57:11.700 --> 01:57:13.810
<v Speaker 7>so what did she discover?</v>

1857
01:57:15.560 --> 01:57:17.540
<v Speaker 7>What was important</v>

1858
01:57:19.360 --> 01:57:20.193
<v Speaker 7>to us,</v>

1859
01:57:20.550 --> 01:57:24.660
<v Speaker 7>and she didn't discover this depth was terrifying because it was,</v>

1860
01:57:25.310 --> 01:57:30.310
<v Speaker 7>what was you with the hell off comprehension and much quicker than she was.</v>

1861
01:57:32.580 --> 01:57:34.500
<v Speaker 7>And she went away thinking,</v>

1862
01:57:35.060 --> 01:57:35.893
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

1863
01:57:36.560 --> 01:57:41.560
<v Speaker 7>that I did the thing I was most afraid of doing your animals.</v>

1864
01:57:43.560 --> 01:57:47.030
<v Speaker 7>Not only am I not more damaged than reverse,</v>

1865
01:57:47.250 --> 01:57:48.810
<v Speaker 7>I'm actually better than it was.</v>

1866
01:57:49.650 --> 01:57:52.550
<v Speaker 7>And so from then on she got up reference point,</v>

1867
01:57:53.340 --> 01:57:54.380
<v Speaker 7>which is an interesting to.</v>

1868
01:57:54.450 --> 01:57:59.440
<v Speaker 7>I think this is why I'm initiate first dance</v>

1869
01:58:01.810 --> 01:58:04.390
<v Speaker 7>extraordinary young into something absolutely terrified,</v>

1870
01:58:04.860 --> 01:58:06.600
<v Speaker 7>genuinely terrified.</v>

1871
01:58:06.780 --> 01:58:08.070
<v Speaker 7>So for the rest of your life,</v>

1872
01:58:08.071 --> 01:58:12.210
<v Speaker 7>they know the difference between what's actually terrifying must just sort of.</v>

1873
01:58:13.700 --> 01:58:18.470
<v Speaker 7>Because you really need to know that because you need to go and work with</v>

1874
01:58:18.480 --> 01:58:20.040
<v Speaker 7>patients versus conferences</v>

1875
01:58:22.090 --> 01:58:25.520
<v Speaker 7>she could prepare like reality.</v>

1876
01:58:25.720 --> 01:58:26.553
<v Speaker 7>Like</v>

1877
01:58:28.610 --> 01:58:31.970
<v Speaker 7>most people I example avail,</v>

1878
01:58:32.310 --> 01:58:35.720
<v Speaker 7>despite the real life with Belle</v>

1879
01:58:38.250 --> 01:58:40.620
<v Speaker 7>arte reverse best.</v>

1880
01:58:43.060 --> 01:58:46.130
<v Speaker 7>So you don't have a story real.</v>

1881
01:58:56.030 --> 01:58:56.863
<v Speaker 7>That's</v>

1882
01:59:00.340 --> 01:59:01.840
<v Speaker 7>all right.</v>

1883

01:59:07.380 --> 01:59:08.780

<v Speaker 3>he need to be necessarily.</v>

1939
02:07:48.740 --> 02:07:49.590
<v Speaker 3>I think that</v>

1940
02:07:53.940 --> 02:07:54.773
<v Speaker 3>fear</v>

1941
02:07:57.440 --> 02:08:00.220
<v Speaker 3>around what</v>

1942
02:08:02.290 --> 02:08:03.123
<v Speaker 3>we're</v>

1943
02:08:12.310 --> 02:08:13.143
<v Speaker 3>being</v>

1944
02:08:15.670 --> 02:08:16.960
<v Speaker 3>punished for your face.</v>

1945
02:08:17.720 --> 02:08:18.900
<v Speaker 3>It's so</v>

1946
02:08:34.800 --> 02:08:35.633
<v Speaker 3>minimal</v>

1947
02:08:39.030 --> 02:08:42.360
<v Speaker 3>and so built up.</v>

1948
02:08:42.940 --> 02:08:45.090
<v Speaker 3>Then instigate</v>

1949
02:09:07.300 --> 02:09:08.133
<v Speaker 3>deeply</v>

1950
02:09:10.310 --> 02:09:11.143
<v Speaker 3>unhappy,</v>

1951
02:09:16.500 --> 02:09:18.690
<v Speaker 3>not depressed</v>

1952
02:09:31.430 --> 02:09:35.560
<v Speaker 3>people</v>

1953
02:09:46.100 --> 02:09:46.933
<v Speaker 3>necessarily.</v>

1954
02:09:47.580 --> 02:09:48.540
<v Speaker 3>You think</v>

1955
02:09:53.170 --> 02:09:54.750
<v Speaker 3>that's the other thing</v>

1956
02:09:58.790 --> 02:09:59.623
<v Speaker 3>is</v>

1957
02:10:07.090 --> 02:10:10.940
<v Speaker 3>that certain states and then to see</v>

1958
02:10:13.460 --> 02:10:14.293
<v Speaker 3>doing</v>

1959
02:10:16.960 --> 02:10:19.220
<v Speaker 3>political background,</v>

1960
02:10:27.320 --> 02:10:29.500
<v Speaker 3>at least you</v>

1961
02:10:31.340 --> 02:10:32.260
<v Speaker 3>got the.</v>

1962
02:10:33.180 --> 02:10:38.180
<v Speaker 3>The people who are on the market,</v>

1963
02:10:40.370 --> 02:10:45.370
<v Speaker 3>conceptual IPA is political in their world.</v>

1964
02:10:45.471 --> 02:10:50.040
<v Speaker 3>There isn't one of the things that weren't considered food.</v>

1965
02:10:51.400 --> 02:10:53.130
<v Speaker 3>You are</v>

1966
02:10:57.450 --> 02:11:00.040
<v Speaker 3>have receipt for</v>

1967
02:11:02.200 --> 02:11:05.140
<v Speaker 3>what really is.</v>

1968
02:11:06.820 --> 02:11:09.600
<v Speaker 3>Here's something that you've</v>

1969
02:11:11.990 --> 02:11:13.490
<v Speaker 3>collected this perspective.</v>

1970
02:11:15.460 --> 02:11:17.590
<v Speaker 3>There is no such thing.</v>

1971
02:11:17.600 --> 02:11:18.433
<v Speaker 3>That's</v>

1972
02:11:19.490 --> 02:11:21.030
<v Speaker 3>not that they oppose it.</v>

1973
02:11:22.260 --> 02:11:23.870
<v Speaker 3>It isn't a movie</v>

1974
02:11:25.610 --> 02:11:26.443
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1975
02:11:26.660 --> 02:11:28.310
<v Speaker 3>so if you stand up and say</v>

1976
02:11:34.340 --> 02:11:38.330
<v Speaker 3>that's not acceptable moving because you are,</v>

1977
02:11:39.640 --> 02:11:44.640
<v Speaker 3>you're an hour of the dominant group and whatever you awkward regardless of why</v>

1978
02:11:48.120 --> 02:11:53.120
<v Speaker 3>you're outdated or regardless of making sure opinion is nothing much you your</v>

1979
02:11:58.250 --> 02:11:59.083
<v Speaker 3>a</v>

1980
02:12:01.520 --> 02:12:05.080
<v Speaker 3>framework and so one of</v>

1981
02:12:06.660 --> 02:12:09.610
<v Speaker 3>the hippies I believe</v>

1982
02:12:11.710 --> 02:12:16.710
<v Speaker 3>and I do believe and I do consent to propositions that are</v>

1983
02:12:23.270 --> 02:12:26.800
<v Speaker 3>game and they're very happy with them.</v>

1984
02:12:27.740 --> 02:12:32.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm not playing pool and so they don't know what to do about.</v>

1985
02:12:32.691 --> 02:12:36.550
<v Speaker 3>That is definitely a far right.</v>

1986
02:12:36.640 --> 02:12:37.473
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

1987
02:12:38.290 --> 02:12:39.123
<v Speaker 3>Then</v>

1988
02:12:41.840 --> 02:12:42.673
<v Speaker 3>maybe</v>

1989
02:12:46.080 --> 02:12:47.240
<v Speaker 3>that's convenient,</v>

1990
02:12:47.600 --> 02:12:50.780
<v Speaker 3>so it's easier to demonize.</v>

1991
02:12:50.781 --> 02:12:53.370
<v Speaker 3>That is to again,</v>

1992
02:13:00.070 --> 02:13:00.903
<v Speaker 3>more</v>

1993
02:13:06.570 --> 02:13:07.403
<v Speaker 3>rights</v>

1994
02:13:12.990 --> 02:13:14.180
<v Speaker 3>in our family.</v>

1995
02:13:15.220 --> 02:13:17.120
<v Speaker 3>Stress is</v>

1996
02:13:20.270 --> 02:13:21.450
<v Speaker 3>certainly not the case.</v>

1997
02:13:21.570 --> 02:13:26.380
<v Speaker 3>The reason that I'm very pleased about it,</v>

1998

02:16:15.640 --> 02:16:16.473
<v Speaker 3>The most powerful</v>

<v Speaker 3>this is</v>

2024
02:17:20.630 --> 02:17:22.120
<v Speaker 3>the statement that</v>

<v Speaker 3>how is it</v>

2046
02:18:55.470 --> 02:18:56.303
<v Speaker 3>making</v>

2047

<v Speaker 3>so far?</v>

2049
02:19:28.650 --> 02:19:29.560
<v Speaker 3>This</v>

2050
02:19:31.700 --> 02:19:32.533
<v Speaker 3>last</v>

02:19:34.640 --> 02:19:35.473
<v Speaker 3>the</v>

2052
02:19:43.140 --> 02:19:44.670
<v Speaker 3>stuff then</v>

2053
02:19:50.350 --> 02:19:51.440
<v Speaker 3>radical.</v>

2054
02:19:53.070 --> 02:19:57.270
<v Speaker 3>The third one is</v>

2055
02:19:59.140 --> 02:20:04.140
<v Speaker 3>all the support needed me and videos and</v>

2056
02:20:07.700 --> 02:20:11.050
<v Speaker 3>then they posted that an idea was the balance,</v>

2057
02:20:12.470 --> 02:20:13.530
<v Speaker 3>but what happened was</v>

2058
02:20:15.620 --> 02:20:17.800
<v Speaker 3>to say</v>

2059
02:20:19.760 --> 02:20:24.710
<v Speaker 3>it's more guarantees me,</v>

2060
02:20:25.900 --> 02:20:26.733
<v Speaker 3>she</v>

2061
02:20:30.240 --> 02:20:31.670
<v Speaker 3>changed her pattern</v>

2062
02:20:34.950 --> 02:20:35.783
<v Speaker 3>where</v>

2063
02:20:40.880 --> 02:20:44.140
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to do something in the two</v>

2064
02:20:46.530 --> 02:20:47.363
<v Speaker 3>zero.</v>

2065
02:20:53.470 --> 02:20:54.303
<v Speaker 3>She</v>

2066
02:20:55.910 --> 02:20:57.980
<v Speaker 3>was really scared</v>

2067
02:21:03.920 --> 02:21:04.753
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

2068
02:21:10.940 --> 02:21:11.773
<v Speaker 3>my</v>

2069
02:21:30.080 --> 02:21:30.913
<v Speaker 3>nipples</v>

2070
02:21:33.480 --> 02:21:34.313
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

2071
02:21:35.610 --> 02:21:37.530
<v Speaker 3>goal in</v>

2072
02:21:40.170 --> 02:21:41.003
<v Speaker 3>selling</v>

2073
02:21:42.840 --> 02:21:45.000
<v Speaker 3>and so that was</v>

2074
02:21:48.750 --> 02:21:49.600
<v Speaker 3>so long</v>

2075
02:21:52.390 --> 02:21:53.223
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>

2076
02:21:53.810 --> 02:21:55.690
<v Speaker 3>She's real.</v>

2077
02:21:57.670 --> 02:21:59.890
<v Speaker 3>You have to do with seeing new</v>

2085
02:22:38.700 --> 02:22:40.040
<v Speaker 3>position where if</v>

2086
