1
00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:00.471
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:00.471 --> 00:00:00.741
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3
00:00:00.741 --> 00:00:01.221
<v Speaker 1>So you're,</v>

4
00:00:01.221 --> 00:00:02.960
<v Speaker 1>you're weaving a number of things together.</v>

5
00:00:02.961 --> 00:00:07.961
<v Speaker 1>So the first is your discovery that if you look at the data,</v>

6
00:00:08.451 --> 00:00:13.070
<v Speaker 1>that things are getting better at a rate that's so remarkable that it is really</v>

7
00:00:13.071 --> 00:00:14.450
<v Speaker 1>nothing short of miraculous.</v>

8
00:00:14.451 --> 00:00:19.010
<v Speaker 1>And you've produced dozens of graphs showing that in enlightenment.</v>

9
00:00:19.011 --> 00:00:19.760
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

10
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.960
<v Speaker 1>I noticed the same thing about three years ago when I was working for a UN panel</v>

11
00:00:23.961 --> 00:00:25.490
<v Speaker 1>on economic sustainability.</v>

12
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.180
<v Speaker 1>The writ for the,</v>

13
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.790
<v Speaker 1>for the secretary general,</v>

14
00:00:28.791 --> 00:00:32.450
<v Speaker 1>the original narrative was extremely pessimistic and detailed how we were</v>

15
00:00:32.451 --> 00:00:36.170
<v Speaker 1>destroying the planet and how everything was getting works and how we were at,</v>

16
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

17
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:37.790
<v Speaker 1>at each other's throats.</v>

18
00:00:37.791 --> 00:00:42.791
<v Speaker 1>And I started to read extremely widely and I found that on measure after measure</v>

19
00:00:43.851 --> 00:00:47.360
<v Speaker 1>with some notable exceptions like ocean oceanic overfishing,</v>

20
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.720
<v Speaker 1>we have been doing so staggeringly much better in the last hundred and 50 years</v>

21
00:00:53.181 --> 00:00:55.790
<v Speaker 1>that you can't believe it on almost every,</v>

22
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.560
<v Speaker 1>on almost every measure you can imagine,</v>

23
00:00:57.561 --> 00:01:00.110
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what you detail out and enlightenment now.</v>

24
00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:01.443
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

25
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.640
<v Speaker 1>and then now that that's a secret,</v>

26
00:01:04.641 --> 00:01:06.230
<v Speaker 1>let's say people don't know about it.</v>

27
00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.960
<v Speaker 1>And Yeah,</v>

28
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.030
<v Speaker 1>and that's strange.</v>

29
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.780
<v Speaker 1>And then you also associated with a critique of the,</v>

30
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:12.350
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

31
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.480
<v Speaker 1>of the enlightenment and scientific rationality.</v>

32
00:01:14.481 --> 00:01:16.850
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to me that you're implying,</v>

33
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.130
<v Speaker 1>or perhaps you're stating explicitly that</v>

34
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.630
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

35
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.340
<v Speaker 1>you're stating explicitly that there's a connection between the pessimism and</v>

36
00:01:25.341 --> 00:01:29.720
<v Speaker 1>the lack of knowledge about this and the critique of the enlightenment and</v>

37
00:01:29.721 --> 00:01:30.554
<v Speaker 1>rationality.</v>

38
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.960
<v Speaker 1>Because there's a question here.</v>

39
00:01:32.961 --> 00:01:36.830
<v Speaker 1>If things are getting so much better and if the news is overwhelming on that</v>

40
00:01:36.831 --> 00:01:37.280
<v Speaker 1>front,</v>

41
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.521
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

42
00:01:37.521 --> 00:01:40.700
<v Speaker 1>some of the things you outlined are like the weather,</v>

43
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.930
<v Speaker 1>the decrease decreases in starvation I suppose are the most remarkable.</v>

44
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.470
<v Speaker 1>And the provision of bountiful food on less and less far bunt,</v>

45
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.840
<v Speaker 1>which is not something that people don't.</v>

46
00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.321
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

47
00:01:51.321 --> 00:01:52.550
<v Speaker 1>if all this is happening,</v>

48
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.650
<v Speaker 1>why don't we know about it?</v>

49
00:01:54.651 --> 00:01:56.090
<v Speaker 1>And how is it linked to the,</v>

50
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.120
<v Speaker 1>how do you think if,</v>

51
00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.930
<v Speaker 1>if it all is linked to the critique of,</v>

52
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.470
<v Speaker 1>of enlightenment rationality,</v>

53
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:03.700
<v Speaker 2>what are the reasons?</v>

54
00:02:03.701 --> 00:02:04.200
<v Speaker 2>Is,</v>

55
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

56
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.110
<v Speaker 2>an interaction between the nature of journalism and the nature of cognition?</v>

57
00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.651
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

58
00:02:08.651 --> 00:02:09.000
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

59
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

60
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.630
<v Speaker 2>the news is about what happens,</v>

61
00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:11.660
<v Speaker 2>not what hasn't happened.</v>

62
00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:12.910
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of the,</v>

63
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

64
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.870
<v Speaker 2>very beneficial developments consist of things that don't happen.</v>

65
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.430
<v Speaker 2>Countries that are at peace,</v>

66
00:02:18.431 --> 00:02:19.264
<v Speaker 2>that used to be</v>

67
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.360
<v Speaker 2>kids who are not starving.</v>

68
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.423
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

69
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.280
<v Speaker 2>a kit,</v>

70
00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

71
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.740
<v Speaker 2>terrorist attacks that do not happen.</v>

72
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.300
<v Speaker 2>You never see a journalist saying,</v>

73
00:02:28.301 --> 00:02:31.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm reporting live from a country that's been at peace for 40 years.</v>

74
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.860
<v Speaker 2>But if a war breaks out,</v>

75
00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.960
<v Speaker 2>you can be sure that we'll hear about it all the more.</v>

76
00:02:34.961 --> 00:02:38.650
<v Speaker 2>So now that to a majority of humanity consists of,</v>

77
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.951
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

78
00:02:38.951 --> 00:02:40.390
<v Speaker 2>on the spot video.</v>

79
00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.290
<v Speaker 2>Journalists thanks to smart phones,</v>

80
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:44.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

81
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.860
<v Speaker 2>also,</v>

82
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:45.693
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

83
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.440
<v Speaker 2>bad things can happen quickly.</v>

84
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.400
<v Speaker 2>Things can blow up,</v>

85
00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:49.270
<v Speaker 2>worst can start,</v>

86
00:02:49.271 --> 00:02:50.350
<v Speaker 2>a massacre can happen,</v>

87
00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.090
<v Speaker 2>but good things aren't built in a day.</v>

88
00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.350
<v Speaker 2>And they often consist of incremental improvements with few percentage points a</v>

89
00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.200
<v Speaker 2>year that the compound that that accumulate.</v>

90
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.600
<v Speaker 2>But that can never make the news because they never happened all of a sudden on</v>

91
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.370
<v Speaker 2>a Thursday in October.</v>

92
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.490
<v Speaker 2>But together with all the,</v>

93
00:03:07.491 --> 00:03:08.170
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

94
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.800
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

95
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.740
<v Speaker 2>cognitive impediments to understanding the state of the world,</v>

96
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.860
<v Speaker 2>the fact that news reports memorable events.</v>

97
00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:15.694
<v Speaker 2>And we know,</v>

98
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:16.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

99
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.110
<v Speaker 2>from the,</v>

100
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

101
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.060
<v Speaker 2>study of the cognition of risk and probability from Daniel Kahneman and Amos</v>

102
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.640
<v Speaker 2>Tversky,</v>

103
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.320
<v Speaker 2>that we tend to assess probability and risk by a shortcut called the</v>

104
00:03:29.321 --> 00:03:30.550
<v Speaker 2>availability heuristic.</v>

105
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.971
<v Speaker 2>Namely,</v>

106
00:03:30.971 --> 00:03:34.210
<v Speaker 2>the easier it is to I dredge up an example from memory,</v>

107
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.070
<v Speaker 2>the more likely we think something is.</v>

108
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.130
<v Speaker 2>And so people think that a tornadoes kill a lot of people,</v>

109
00:03:39.131 --> 00:03:43.150
<v Speaker 2>but they don't realize that falling off ladders kills far more people.</v>

110
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.821
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

111
00:03:43.821 --> 00:03:45.100
<v Speaker 2>cause when someone falls off a ladder,</v>

112
00:03:45.101 --> 00:03:45.970
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't make the news.</v>

113
00:03:45.971 --> 00:03:47.770
<v Speaker 2>But when there is a tornado it does.</v>

114
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:48.061
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

115
00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:52.230
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that solar power kills more people to nuclear power every a year?</v>

116
00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.550
<v Speaker 2>I did not know that,</v>

117
00:03:54.551 --> 00:03:57.160
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't surprise me because nuclear power kills no one,</v>

118
00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.880
<v Speaker 1>I suppose as installers fall off,</v>

119
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.360
<v Speaker 1>roof installers fall off roofs.</v>

120
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.513
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

121
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.880
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

122
00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:05.713
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

123
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:06.071
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

124
00:04:06.071 --> 00:04:06.380
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

125
00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.310
<v Speaker 1>so that's interesting.</v>

126
00:04:07.311 --> 00:04:08.360
<v Speaker 1>So you can imagine that.</v>

127
00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:10.550
<v Speaker 1>So good news or bad news,</v>

128
00:04:10.551 --> 00:04:12.950
<v Speaker 1>his son is dramatic.</v>

129
00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.831
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>

130
00:04:13.831 --> 00:04:17.720
<v Speaker 1>we're tilted towards the processing of negative information in any case.</v>

131
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:18.351
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

132
00:04:18.351 --> 00:04:19.170
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

133
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.490
<v Speaker 2>We don't naturally computer ratio between,</v>

134
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.731
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

135
00:04:22.731 --> 00:04:24.860
<v Speaker 2>occurrences and not occurrences,</v>

136
00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.160
<v Speaker 2>which is of course what goes into a probability and rational assessment of risk</v>

137
00:04:30.561 --> 00:04:31.394
<v Speaker 2>and probability.</v>

138
00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:32.653
<v Speaker 2>So there's that,</v>

139
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:33.301
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

140
00:04:33.301 --> 00:04:36.560
<v Speaker 2>it's more than that than that because in intellectual life,</v>

141
00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.700
<v Speaker 2>in large parts of academia and in,</v>

142
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:40.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

143
00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.590
<v Speaker 2>among commentators and pundits,</v>

144
00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.840
<v Speaker 2>there is an ideology of,</v>

145
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:45.331
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

146
00:04:45.331 --> 00:04:46.164
<v Speaker 2>of decline.</v>

147
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.320
<v Speaker 2>It goes back to the 19th century,</v>

148
00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

149
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.660
<v Speaker 2>part of the counter enlightenment that arose in a,</v>

150
00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.660
<v Speaker 2>as a reaction to enlightenment,</v>

151
00:04:53.661 --> 00:04:54.351
<v Speaker 2>hopes for,</v>

152
00:04:54.351 --> 00:04:56.820
<v Speaker 2>for progress and rationality that said that,</v>

153
00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:57.180
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

154
00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.180
<v Speaker 2>that the holes that society is Western civilization is teetering on the brink or</v>

155
00:05:03.111 --> 00:05:03.944
<v Speaker 2>it's circling,</v>

156
00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.440
<v Speaker 2>circling the drain and it's going to collapse,</v>

157
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

158
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.101
<v Speaker 2>any,</v>

159
00:05:07.101 --> 00:05:08.030
<v Speaker 2>any time now.</v>

160
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.920
<v Speaker 2>And it's up to the intellectuals and commentators and,</v>

161
00:05:12.921 --> 00:05:13.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

162
00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.701
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

163
00:05:13.701 --> 00:05:14.270
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

164
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

165
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.870
<v Speaker 2>point out how decadent to degenerate society is and to people like that musical</v>

166
00:05:21.381 --> 00:05:23.060
<v Speaker 2>progress comes also in a front</v>

167
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:25.000
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

168
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.790
<v Speaker 2>The reaction is,</v>

169
00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:26.151
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

170
00:05:26.151 --> 00:05:26.780
<v Speaker 2>we've been,</v>

171
00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.010
<v Speaker 2>we've been a warning,</v>

172
00:05:28.011 --> 00:05:30.650
<v Speaker 2>all of you about how society is on the verge of collapse.</v>

173
00:05:30.651 --> 00:05:33.920
<v Speaker 2>Don't come around and tell us that if everything's going fine,</v>

174
00:05:33.921 --> 00:05:34.140
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

175
00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.150
<v Speaker 2>what are we going to do now?</v>

176
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

177
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.390
<v Speaker 1>You identify a lot of that with the romantic types like Russo.</v>

178
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.190
<v Speaker 1>And when I was reading,</v>

179
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.430
<v Speaker 1>I wondered to the,</v>

180
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.340
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

181
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:49.200
<v Speaker 1>there's a powerful Marxists narrative that's run it's course for about 130 years</v>

182
00:05:49.201 --> 00:05:49.411
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

183
00:05:49.411 --> 00:05:54.400
<v Speaker 1>That's predicated on the idea that there's an oppressed class and the no</v>

184
00:05:54.401 --> 00:05:55.260
<v Speaker 1>pressure class.</v>

185
00:05:55.261 --> 00:06:00.261
<v Speaker 1>And that narrative seems also to thrive on or two to be a fronted by the idea</v>

186
00:06:01.431 --> 00:06:02.264
<v Speaker 1>that the current,</v>

187
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.230
<v Speaker 1>the current system might be producing benefits across the board.</v>

188
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.120
<v Speaker 1>I think you do in fact,</v>

189
00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:11.660
<v Speaker 1>in one part of the book ask about whether or not these benefits are only</v>

190
00:06:11.661 --> 00:06:12.111
<v Speaker 1>accruing,</v>

191
00:06:12.111 --> 00:06:12.741
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

192
00:06:12.741 --> 00:06:13.574
<v Speaker 1>to the rich.</v>

193
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.970
<v Speaker 1>And that doesn't seem to be the case as far as,</v>

194
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.560
<v Speaker 1>as far as the data indicates.</v>

195
00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:19.743
<v Speaker 1>Is that a fair,</v>

196
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:21.650
<v Speaker 2>quite the contrary.</v>

197
00:06:21.651 --> 00:06:23.720
<v Speaker 2>The most dramatic improvements have been at the,</v>

198
00:06:23.721 --> 00:06:24.960
<v Speaker 2>at the bottom among re,</v>

199
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:25.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

200
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:27.170
<v Speaker 2>extreme poor where,</v>

201
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:27.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

202
00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.160
<v Speaker 2>the proportion of the world's population living in extreme poverty,</v>

203
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.690
<v Speaker 2>it's fallen over the last couple of centuries from probably around 90% to less</v>

204
00:06:35.691 --> 00:06:36.524
<v Speaker 2>than 10%.</v>

205
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:37.810
<v Speaker 2>And the United Nations is,</v>

206
00:06:37.811 --> 00:06:42.560
<v Speaker 2>sends one of it's millennium elegant goals to eliminate extreme poverty</v>

207
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.420
<v Speaker 2>everywhere by the year 2030.</v>

208
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:49.220
<v Speaker 2>That's probably too optimistic at the fact that it can be set as a,</v>

209
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:49.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

210
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:50.031
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>

211
00:06:50.031 --> 00:06:51.620
<v Speaker 2>as a plausible aspiration.</v>

212
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.190
<v Speaker 2>Is it self astonishing?</v>

213
00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:53.471
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

214
00:06:53.471 --> 00:06:56.260
<v Speaker 1>I know the UN had said as one of its millennial goals,</v>

215
00:06:56.261 --> 00:07:01.261
<v Speaker 1>the having of absolute poverty between 2000 and 2015 and that was accomplished</v>

216
00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:02.710
<v Speaker 1>by 2012</v>

217
00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:04.310
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

218
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:05.160
<v Speaker 2>Ahead of schedule.</v>

219
00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:05.611
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

220
00:07:05.611 --> 00:07:06.131
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

221
00:07:06.131 --> 00:07:06.964
<v Speaker 2>And that</v>

222
00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:09.520
<v Speaker 2>Marxism has a,</v>

223
00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:09.841
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

224
00:07:09.841 --> 00:07:14.220
<v Speaker 2>a complicated relationship to progress because Marxist doctrine actually does,</v>

225
00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:15.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

226
00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:16.740
<v Speaker 2>layout up pathway to progress.</v>

227
00:07:16.741 --> 00:07:17.401
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately,</v>

228
00:07:17.401 --> 00:07:19.950
<v Speaker 2>that pathway consists of violet class conflict.</v>

229
00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:20.761
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

230
00:07:20.761 --> 00:07:23.550
<v Speaker 2>it isn't the enlightenment ideal of progress through,</v>

231
00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:24.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

232
00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:25.020
<v Speaker 2>through problem solving,</v>

233
00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:26.120
<v Speaker 2>the pro se,</v>

234
00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:26.953
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

235
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:27.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

236
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:31.980
<v Speaker 2>belief that a nature throws problems at us and that if we applied brain power,</v>

237
00:07:31.981 --> 00:07:33.750
<v Speaker 2>we can gradually chip away at them.</v>

238
00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.530
<v Speaker 2>Mentally of progress is quite different.</v>

239
00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:39.300
<v Speaker 2>And you're right that there is a,</v>

240
00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.560
<v Speaker 2>a pretty strong,</v>

241
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:43.740
<v Speaker 2>there are critiques of progress both from the left and from the right,</v>

242
00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:44.800
<v Speaker 2>but from,</v>

243
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.633
<v Speaker 2>from the left,</v>

244
00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:46.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

245
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:47.820
<v Speaker 2>there is a,</v>

246
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:48.160
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

247
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:48.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

248
00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.510
<v Speaker 2>kind of contempt for institutions like,</v>

249
00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:52.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

250
00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:56.910
<v Speaker 2>like markets like liberal democracy that deserve a lot of the credit for the</v>

251
00:07:56.911 --> 00:07:59.320
<v Speaker 2>progress that we've made in that would be to,</v>

252
00:07:59.350 --> 00:07:59.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

253
00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.220
<v Speaker 2>at least in the academic left a,</v>

254
00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:02.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

255
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:06.060
<v Speaker 2>an despising of the very idea of progress.</v>

256
00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:07.280
<v Speaker 2>And I found that that the,</v>

257
00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:12.120
<v Speaker 2>the only political faction is actually sympathetic to progress or libertarians</v>

258
00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:15.570
<v Speaker 2>that have been a number of rational optimist books,</v>

259
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:16.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

260
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:20.760
<v Speaker 2>in the last decade by people like Matt Ridley and Ron Bailey and Johan Norberg</v>

261
00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:21.600
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

262
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

263
00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:27.380
<v Speaker 2>that do have an overlapping vision to the one that I took on the light light</v>

264
00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:30.960
<v Speaker 2>down and we documenting progress.</v>

265
00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:31.950
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

266
00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:33.320
<v Speaker 2>but both from the,</v>

267
00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:33.831
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

268
00:08:33.831 --> 00:08:33.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

269
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:36.210
<v Speaker 2>academic left and from the political right,</v>

270
00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:37.440
<v Speaker 2>there has been a,</v>

271
00:08:37.441 --> 00:08:38.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

272
00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:38.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

273
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:43.080
<v Speaker 2>a contempt for the notion of progress or their different reasons in academia.</v>

274
00:08:43.081 --> 00:08:45.260
<v Speaker 2>It goes back to the Romantics too.</v>

275
00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:46.230
<v Speaker 2>So as you mentioned,</v>

276
00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.570
<v Speaker 2>but also to Schopenhauer nature.</v>

277
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:49.261
<v Speaker 2>Heidegger,</v>

278
00:08:49.261 --> 00:08:50.490
<v Speaker 2>the existentialists,</v>

279
00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:53.130
<v Speaker 2>the critical theorists of the Frankfurt school,</v>

280
00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:56.160
<v Speaker 2>large swaths of the academic humanities.</v>

281
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:56.431
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

282
00:08:56.431 --> 00:08:57.420
<v Speaker 1>actually the test,</v>

283
00:08:57.421 --> 00:08:58.254
<v Speaker 1>the enlightenment,</v>

284
00:08:58.270 --> 00:08:59.370
<v Speaker 1>I ironically enough,</v>

285
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.230
<v Speaker 1>not by no means all of them,</v>

286
00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:02.161
<v Speaker 1>but I have to have,</v>

287
00:09:02.161 --> 00:09:03.750
<v Speaker 1>but there's a significant faction</v>

288
00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:06.790
<v Speaker 1>questionnaire,</v>

289
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:07.940
<v Speaker 1>kitchen partners.</v>

290
00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:08.783
<v Speaker 1>Why,</v>

291
00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:12.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean one of the things that really struck me as I've gone through this</v>

292
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:16.050
<v Speaker 1>material over the last years is that this is really good news.</v>

293
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.650
<v Speaker 1>Particularly it doesn't really matter whether you're on the left to the right.</v>

294
00:09:19.651 --> 00:09:20.490
<v Speaker 1>If you're on the left,</v>

295
00:09:20.491 --> 00:09:25.491
<v Speaker 1>you think that the fact that the poorest of the poor are being lifted out of</v>

296
00:09:26.071 --> 00:09:26.910
<v Speaker 1>their abject,</v>

297
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:29.550
<v Speaker 1>absolute abject misery at a rate that's just,</v>

298
00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:34.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you could hope for a faster improvement no matter how optimistic</v>

299
00:09:34.321 --> 00:09:35.154
<v Speaker 1>you work.</v>

300
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.320
<v Speaker 1>And then on the right of course,</v>

301
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:41.550
<v Speaker 1>the fact that the benefits of liberal democracy,</v>

302
00:09:41.551 --> 00:09:41.971
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

303
00:09:41.971 --> 00:09:44.430
<v Speaker 1>and free markets are driving this in large part,</v>

304
00:09:44.431 --> 00:09:46.560
<v Speaker 1>you'd take would also be a cause for celebration.</v>
