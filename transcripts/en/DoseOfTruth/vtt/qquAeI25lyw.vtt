3
00:00:08.701 --> 00:00:09.534
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

4
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:11.103

5
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:16.970
<v Speaker 1>Let me find it.</v>

6
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm already failing here.</v>

7
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:28.753
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>

8
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.060
<v Speaker 1>well you know when you also have to look with regards to that.</v>

9
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.210
<v Speaker 1>The shadow ideas like you have to get in touch with your anger.</v>

10
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:46.341
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

11
00:00:46.341 --> 00:00:49.130
<v Speaker 1>lots of people are resentful about all sorts of things.</v>

12
00:00:49.131 --> 00:00:50.190
<v Speaker 1>They're resentful about,</v>

13
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:51.523
<v Speaker 2>oh</v>

14
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.250
<v Speaker 1>women and they're resentful about men and they're resentful about the patriarchy</v>

15
00:00:55.251 --> 00:00:57.370
<v Speaker 1>and they're resentful about the left wing,</v>

16
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.220
<v Speaker 1>resentful about the right wing and the resentful about politicians and they're</v>

17
00:01:01.221 --> 00:01:06.221
<v Speaker 1>resentful about the cataclysmic force of nature and its ability to make people</v>

18
00:01:07.671 --> 00:01:12.671
<v Speaker 1>sick and and suffer and they're resentful about their own inadequacies in the</v>

19
00:01:12.801 --> 00:01:13.101
<v Speaker 1>boat.</v>

20
00:01:13.101 --> 00:01:18.101
<v Speaker 1>Their bad parenting and God like the list is just bloody endless and that can</v>

21
00:01:18.381 --> 00:01:19.730
<v Speaker 1>make you very,</v>

22
00:01:19.731 --> 00:01:24.731
<v Speaker 1>very angry and that's part of that resentment and cynical and bitter and dark</v>

23
00:01:24.771 --> 00:01:29.210
<v Speaker 1>and full of fantasies about destruction and the desire to bring things down and</v>

24
00:01:29.211 --> 00:01:33.380
<v Speaker 1>the wish that everyone else suffered and the desire to shake your fist at God.</v>

25
00:01:33.381 --> 00:01:35.810
<v Speaker 1>And all of that's really dark.</v>

26
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

27
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.251
<v Speaker 1>young said,</v>

28
00:01:37.251 --> 00:01:37.670
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

29
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.730
<v Speaker 1>the shadow human shadow extends all the way down to hell.</v>

30
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.353
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

31
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.860
<v Speaker 1>we're going to try that one more time because I failed there.</v>

32
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.030
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

33
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.930
<v Speaker 1>let's try this again.</v>

34
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.230
<v Speaker 1>I touch with the depths of your anger.</v>

35
00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.010
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

36
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.770
<v Speaker 1>lots of people are resentful about all sorts of things.</v>

37
00:02:00.771 --> 00:02:01.840
<v Speaker 1>They're resentful about,</v>

38
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.143
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

39
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.691
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>

40
00:02:03.691 --> 00:02:08.130
<v Speaker 1>And they're resentful about men and their research and they're resentful of the</v>

41
00:02:08.131 --> 00:02:08.481
<v Speaker 1>left.</v>

42
00:02:08.481 --> 00:02:09.260
<v Speaker 1>Wait 26,</v>

43
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:14.260
<v Speaker 1>present politicians and resentful about the,</v>

44
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.730
<v Speaker 1>like the cataclysmic force of nature and its ability to make people sick and</v>

45
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.460
<v Speaker 1>suffer and they're resentful about their own.</v>

46
00:02:23.461 --> 00:02:24.470
<v Speaker 1>And now he's in the boat.</v>

47
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.680
<v Speaker 1>They're bad parents suffer both nature and stuff.</v>

48
00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:29.970
<v Speaker 1>And it's true.</v>

49
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.080
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people</v>

50
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.290
<v Speaker 1>say that say the systems that we live in are what causes our suffering,</v>

51
00:02:37.291 --> 00:02:37.891
<v Speaker 1>and that's true.</v>

52
00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:39.060
<v Speaker 1>It can add to the suffering,</v>

53
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.850
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately the suffering is just being itself,</v>

54
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:42.773
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

55
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.913
<v Speaker 1>and.</v>

56
00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

57
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.473
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

58
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.141
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

59
00:02:46.141 --> 00:02:47.100
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

60
00:02:47.101 --> 00:02:47.934
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

61
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.670
<v Speaker 1>the very idea of resentment.</v>

62
00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:56.350
<v Speaker 1>I've just come across a paper or a book called on resentment.</v>

63
00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm forgetting who the authors are and it's a</v>

64
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.961
<v Speaker 3>constantly.</v>

65
00:03:01.961 --> 00:03:06.961
<v Speaker 3>It goes over different people including a nature and Virginia Woolf on and finch</v>

66
00:03:07.661 --> 00:03:10.210
<v Speaker 3>who was a 17th century poet,</v>

67
00:03:10.211 --> 00:03:10.560
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

68
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

69
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.810
<v Speaker 3>she was a very much against the Patriarchy and Virginia Woolf basically spells</v>

70
00:03:17.081 --> 00:03:20.320
<v Speaker 3>out that it was a and finches,</v>

71
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

72
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.680
<v Speaker 3>dwelling in her own writing that contributed to her a resentment and that the</v>

73
00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.670
<v Speaker 3>very act of writing for her was,</v>

74
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:31.653
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

75
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.141
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

76
00:03:32.141 --> 00:03:32.974
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

77
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.750
<v Speaker 3>the source of her own mental illness.</v>

78
00:03:34.751 --> 00:03:35.710
<v Speaker 3>And it's constantly,</v>

79
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.760
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

80
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.760
<v Speaker 3>you constantly see that these authors or writers mentioned resentment as a</v>

81
00:03:45.041 --> 00:03:46.270
<v Speaker 3>mental illness.</v>

82
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.433
<v Speaker 3>And I never,</v>

83
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.681
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

84
00:03:47.681 --> 00:03:52.681
<v Speaker 3>I've heard Peterson talk about it and he may have even explicitly said that,</v>

85
00:03:53.261 --> 00:03:53.820
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

86
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:54.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

87
00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.881
<v Speaker 3>never have.</v>

88
00:03:54.881 --> 00:03:55.130
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

89
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.963
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

90
00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

91
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.160
<v Speaker 3>never outside of him have I thought about it like that or heard it from somebody</v>

92
00:04:01.161 --> 00:04:01.994
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>

93
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.871
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

94
00:04:02.871 --> 00:04:04.220
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting.</v>

95
00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.541
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

96
00:04:04.541 --> 00:04:09.541
<v Speaker 4>I've listened to a lot of his Bible lectures and when the store is the way he</v>

97
00:04:10.071 --> 00:04:11.660
<v Speaker 4>describes the enable story,</v>

98
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.200
<v Speaker 4>it really made me think about like in my own life when I've thought about house,</v>

99
00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.470
<v Speaker 4>maybe I blame someone else for my problems or how I blamed,</v>

100
00:04:21.471 --> 00:04:21.830
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

101
00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:22.191
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

102
00:04:22.191 --> 00:04:25.460
<v Speaker 4>the fact of being then I thought about and that makes sense because like,</v>

103
00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:26.810
<v Speaker 4>what am I actually blaming,</v>

104
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.320
<v Speaker 4>not blaming the fact that I'm just alive and if I'm blaming that,</v>

105
00:04:30.321 --> 00:04:31.810
<v Speaker 4>then uh,</v>

106
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.230
<v Speaker 4>maybe I should do something to make that better rather than just blaming</v>

107
00:04:36.231 --> 00:04:37.160
<v Speaker 4>everyone else.</v>

108
00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:38.570
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

109
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:39.400
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

110
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.980
<v Speaker 4>it certainly has.</v>

111
00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.060
<v Speaker 4>I think it happens to everybody.</v>

112
00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:42.733
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

113
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.633
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

114
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.633
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

115
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.680
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

116
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

117
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:46.080
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

118
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.330
<v Speaker 3>I guess everybody can be a victim,</v>

119
00:04:49.331 --> 00:04:52.350
<v Speaker 3>but I think what's another interesting thing in that book it,</v>

120
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.400
<v Speaker 3>I forget the author who,</v>

121
00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:00.420
<v Speaker 3>I think it might've been a character guard that said,</v>

122
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure that might be another person that,</v>

123
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

124
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.510
<v Speaker 3>you need a victim,</v>

125
00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.010
<v Speaker 3>you need a victimizer,</v>

126
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.840
<v Speaker 3>but then you also need this,</v>

127
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:11.111
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

128
00:05:11.111 --> 00:05:12.590
<v Speaker 3>this third person,</v>

129
00:05:12.591 --> 00:05:17.591
<v Speaker 3>this spectator who basically is emancipated from the resentment or resentment or</v>

130
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.720
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>

131
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.580
<v Speaker 3>emancipated from the victimization,</v>

132
00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.650
<v Speaker 3>who is able to see it and you know,</v>

133
00:05:23.651 --> 00:05:28.540
<v Speaker 3>almost empathize with the people who are being victimized.</v>

134
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.280
<v Speaker 3>And Peterson talks about that too,</v>

135
00:05:30.281 --> 00:05:31.630
<v Speaker 3>not necessarily in this video,</v>

136
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.130
<v Speaker 3>but he talks about how,</v>

137
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.761
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

138
00:05:33.761 --> 00:05:34.594
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

139
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.300
<v Speaker 3>it can be evil to,</v>

140
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:39.343
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

141
00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.880
<v Speaker 3>to empathize with somebody else's problems</v>

142
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:45.403
<v Speaker 4>and</v>

143
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.150
<v Speaker 4>you're robbing them of their own capacity to solve them.</v>

144
00:05:50.151 --> 00:05:50.800
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

145
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.190
<v Speaker 4>They like taking on their problems,</v>

146
00:05:52.191 --> 00:05:52.551
<v Speaker 4>stealing.</v>

147
00:05:52.551 --> 00:05:53.720
<v Speaker 4>Then yeah,</v>

148
00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:56.530
<v Speaker 4>I listened to a,</v>

149
00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:58.283
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

150
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.760
<v Speaker 4>Steven Hicks called a post explaining postmodernism and kierkegaard comes up</v>

151
00:06:05.391 --> 00:06:06.224
<v Speaker 4>quite a bit,</v>

152
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.461
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

153
00:06:06.461 --> 00:06:06.650
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

154
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.900
<v Speaker 4>anyway,</v>

155
00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.270
<v Speaker 4>so I guess maybe we should get back to the video and see what comes up next.</v>

156
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.541
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

157
00:06:11.541 --> 00:06:13.070
<v Speaker 4>So I'm at 39 seconds.</v>

158
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:14.150
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

159
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.410
<v Speaker 4>let me,</v>

160
00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.480
<v Speaker 4>I'm at 49 and I'll come back to the.</v>

161
00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:17.600
<v Speaker 4>I'll come back to 39.</v>

162
00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:18.963
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

163
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:24.070
<v Speaker 4>Likelihood you have of terrible capacity for destructive testing in the boat.</v>

164
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.393
<v Speaker 4>They're bad.</v>

165
00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.120
<v Speaker 4>God like the list is just bloody endless.</v>

166
00:06:29.121 --> 00:06:31.190
<v Speaker 4>And that can make you very,</v>

167
00:06:31.191 --> 00:06:36.191
<v Speaker 4>very angry that that's part of that resentment at 54 dark.</v>

168
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:41.380
<v Speaker 4>And one thing you mentioned is a two says the list is almost endless and that's</v>

169
00:06:43.431 --> 00:06:48.431
<v Speaker 4>sort of goes along the lines of it reaches to the deepest depths of hell if you</v>

170
00:06:49.671 --> 00:06:50.630
<v Speaker 4>really follow that,</v>

171
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:51.100
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

172
00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:51.591
<v Speaker 4>that list,</v>

173
00:06:51.591 --> 00:06:52.424
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

174
00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:53.363
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

175
00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:53.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

176
00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:54.743
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

177
00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:55.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

178
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:59.900
<v Speaker 4>you can always think of a worse place you could be in.</v>

179
00:06:59.901 --> 00:07:02.480
<v Speaker 4>You could always think of a worse thing that you could do.</v>

180
00:07:02.481 --> 00:07:03.314
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

181
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:06.030
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

182
00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:07.700
<v Speaker 4>it's absolutely endless.</v>

183
00:07:07.701 --> 00:07:07.971
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

184
00:07:07.971 --> 00:07:08.081
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

185
00:07:08.081 --> 00:07:09.050
<v Speaker 4>you hear about,</v>

186
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

187
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:15.250
<v Speaker 4>atrocities in the world and though some stand out more than others.</v>

188
00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:16.910
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

189
00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:17.600
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

190
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.060
<v Speaker 3>dare I say know genocide of</v>

191
00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.430
<v Speaker 3>6 million plus you had the concentration camps.</v>

192
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.480
<v Speaker 3>Then you also had the in the,</v>

193
00:07:29.481 --> 00:07:30.314
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

194
00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:31.861
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah.</v>

195
00:07:31.861 --> 00:07:35.120
<v Speaker 4>Your blood left in eastern Europe as they move towards</v>

196
00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.020
<v Speaker 3>Russia.</v>

197
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:36.570
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

198
00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:37.680
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

199
00:07:37.681 --> 00:07:38.410
<v Speaker 3>it</v>

200
00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:39.750
<v Speaker 4>can always be worse.</v>

201
00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:40.863
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

202
00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:42.540
<v Speaker 4>here's a visual for you.</v>

203
00:07:42.541 --> 00:07:47.541
<v Speaker 4>So there's a train that night train that goes from Moscow to St Petersburg and</v>

204
00:07:47.741 --> 00:07:47.841
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

205
00:07:47.841 --> 00:07:49.650
<v Speaker 4>I took that terrain and the entire,</v>

206
00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:53.630
<v Speaker 4>almost the entire length of the railway is just grades</v>

207
00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:56.430
<v Speaker 4>and it's quite the distance.</v>

208
00:07:56.431 --> 00:07:59.820
<v Speaker 4>It takes a eight to nine hours or so to the trainer there.</v>

209
00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:01.373
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

210
00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:02.293
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

211
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:03.640
<v Speaker 4>that's it.</v>

212
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.700
<v Speaker 4>You can see them in the moonlight.</v>

213
00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:06.510
<v Speaker 4>You could,</v>

214
00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:08.820
<v Speaker 4>you just like the reflections of the crosses.</v>

215
00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:11.430
<v Speaker 4>It's millions or hundreds.</v>

216
00:08:11.431 --> 00:08:12.390
<v Speaker 4>At least hundreds of thousands.</v>

217
00:08:12.391 --> 00:08:16.080
<v Speaker 4>I could see like the one that train track it was crazy.</v>

218
00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:18.143
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

219
00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:19.441
<v Speaker 4>like things,</v>

220
00:08:19.441 --> 00:08:20.320
<v Speaker 4>things going to be way more,</v>

221
00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:23.400
<v Speaker 4>way worse than then you could even imagine that.</v>

222
00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:25.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

223
00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:27.540
<v Speaker 3>I can't even comprehend that now.</v>

224
00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:28.913
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

225
00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:33.600
<v Speaker 4>seeing that would just probably leave me numb for a little while.</v>

226
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:35.083
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

227
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.580
<v Speaker 4>it was hard to really contemplate when I was only 17,</v>

228
00:08:38.581 --> 00:08:40.050
<v Speaker 4>but I still kind of remember it.</v>

229
00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:40.920
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

230
00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:41.670
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

231
00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:42.503
<v Speaker 4>it was not,</v>

232
00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:44.220
<v Speaker 4>never seen anything like that before.</v>

233
00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.740
<v Speaker 4>It reminded me of my grandparents when they went to a,</v>

234
00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:51.510
<v Speaker 4>their insurance stationed in Germany after the war and uh,</v>

235
00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.130
<v Speaker 4>they would go to the Canadian,</v>

236
00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:54.661
<v Speaker 4>an ally,</v>

237
00:08:54.661 --> 00:08:59.661
<v Speaker 4>a grave sites and it just the miles and miles of a cross as well and looked</v>

238
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:00.940
<v Speaker 4>some,</v>

239
00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:03.600
<v Speaker 4>I guess Jewish graves in some Muslim grades,</v>

240
00:09:03.601 --> 00:09:05.040
<v Speaker 4>but mostly mostly,</v>

241
00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:05.370
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

242
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:06.203
<v Speaker 4>crosses.</v>

243
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:08.250
<v Speaker 4>But I remember my grandma,</v>

244
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:10.950
<v Speaker 4>my mom remembers my grandma just crying and crying and crying.</v>

245
00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:13.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

246
00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.020
<v Speaker 4>Because these are all men that she might've known,</v>

247
00:09:15.021 --> 00:09:15.854
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

248
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:16.733
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

249
00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:18.483
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

250
00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:18.651
<v Speaker 4>Oh.</v>

251
00:09:18.651 --> 00:09:19.360
<v Speaker 4>Anyways,</v>

252
00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:19.701
<v Speaker 4>so we're,</v>

253
00:09:19.701 --> 00:09:20.990
<v Speaker 4>I'm at 54 seconds.</v>

254
00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:22.481
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>

255
00:09:22.481 --> 00:09:22.820
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

256
00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:23.390
<v Speaker 4>I'll start.</v>

257
00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:24.130
<v Speaker 4>You can go ahead,</v>

258
00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:24.500
<v Speaker 4>start.</v>

259
00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.050
<v Speaker 4>Maybe we'll stop at like why you choose the next stop.</v>

260
00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:28.383
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>

261
00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:31.860
<v Speaker 3>Just tell me a desire to bring things down.</v>

262
00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:36.970
<v Speaker 3>Wished that everyone else suffered and desire to shake your fist at God and all</v>

263
00:09:36.971 --> 00:09:38.530
<v Speaker 3>of that really dark.</v>

264
00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:39.250
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

265
00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:40.001
<v Speaker 3>Young said,</v>

266
00:09:40.001 --> 00:09:41.650
<v Speaker 3>well the shadow human shout,</v>

267
00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:44.920
<v Speaker 3>it extends all the way down to help and he really meant that,</v>

268
00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:46.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

269
00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:51.150
<v Speaker 3>because all the terrible things that people are motivated to do are associated</v>

270
00:09:52.361 --> 00:09:53.690
<v Speaker 3>with that shadow domain.</v>

271
00:09:53.691 --> 00:09:56.140
<v Speaker 3>And like none of you are any.</v>

272
00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:59.260
<v Speaker 3>None of you are saints in any likelihood.</v>

273
00:09:59.261 --> 00:10:03.130
<v Speaker 3>You have a terrible capacity for destructiveness and when you start to consult</v>

274
00:10:03.131 --> 00:10:05.380
<v Speaker 3>your resentment and to see how angry you are,</v>

275
00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:09.310
<v Speaker 3>it can terrify you or deceive the depths of that anger sometimes will manifest</v>

276
00:10:09.311 --> 00:10:10.400
<v Speaker 3>itself in very good.</v>

277
00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:11.080
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>

278
00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:11.913
<v Speaker 3>so I stopped at.</v>

279
00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:13.421
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

280
00:10:13.421 --> 00:10:17.380
<v Speaker 3>I wonder sometimes what it would be like</v>

281
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:18.583
<v Speaker 6>four,</v>

282
00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:20.800
<v Speaker 3>some of the,</v>

283
00:10:20.801 --> 00:10:21.634
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

284
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:23.333
<v Speaker 6>people who</v>

285
00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:28.190
<v Speaker 3>err on the side of social justice to actually see what,</v>

286
00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:34.820
<v Speaker 3>what the possibilities of their own thinking,</v>

287
00:10:34.821 --> 00:10:36.180
<v Speaker 3>what the fruit of their</v>

288
00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:38.721
<v Speaker 3>theories.</v>

289
00:10:38.721 --> 00:10:40.910
<v Speaker 3>But if you were to play out their own</v>

290
00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:43.680
<v Speaker 3>narrative,</v>

291
00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:44.061
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

292
00:10:44.061 --> 00:10:46.280
<v Speaker 3>if you were to play out their own narrative,</v>

293
00:10:46.281 --> 00:10:49.220
<v Speaker 3>what that would lead to and you know,</v>

294
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:54.620
<v Speaker 3>it's probably inevitably leads to the same,</v>

295
00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:55.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

296
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:56.510
<v Speaker 3>if it's,</v>

297
00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:58.040
<v Speaker 3>if it's fueled by resentment,</v>

298
00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:03.400
<v Speaker 3>probably if it fuels and is always fed with the same resentment,</v>

299
00:11:04.161 --> 00:11:06.350
<v Speaker 3>then it will inevitably lead to murder.</v>

300
00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:07.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's,</v>

301
00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.810
<v Speaker 4>well most utopic vision.</v>

302
00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:13.530
<v Speaker 4>The problem with them is that they can never really be achieved.</v>

303
00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:15.480
<v Speaker 4>I guess good to have some goals,</v>

304
00:11:15.481 --> 00:11:17.100
<v Speaker 4>like reduce suffering.</v>

305
00:11:17.101 --> 00:11:17.940
<v Speaker 4>That's not a bad goal,</v>

306
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:22.560
<v Speaker 4>but if your idea's elimination of suffering at all.</v>

307
00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:23.513
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

308
00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:24.630
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

309
00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:27.000
<v Speaker 4>more suffering than it's ever been seen.</v>

310
00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:28.020
<v Speaker 4>And history,</v>

311
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:29.460
<v Speaker 4>at least in the 20th century,</v>

312
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:30.120
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

313
00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.690
<v Speaker 4>has shown us showing us that that's,</v>

314
00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:32.050
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

315
00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:36.570
<v Speaker 4>that's history that we know this history in the past that's just as bad.</v>

316
00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.680
<v Speaker 4>It's all for offer utopia.</v>

317
00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:41.173
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

318
00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:43.670
<v Speaker 3>You can never really achieve it.</v>

319
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:45.830
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

320
00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:46.370
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

321
00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:46.551
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

322
00:11:46.551 --> 00:11:47.330
<v Speaker 3>you can't,</v>

323
00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.580
<v Speaker 3>you can't eliminate suffering.</v>

324
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:50.840
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

325
00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:51.673
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

326
00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:53.120
<v Speaker 3>another interesting,</v>

327
00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:56.013
<v Speaker 3>another interesting</v>

328
00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:00.490
<v Speaker 3>idea in that book on resentment,</v>

329
00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:03.490
<v Speaker 3>I'll throw it into the description though,</v>

330
00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:03.891
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

331
00:12:03.891 --> 00:12:06.280
<v Speaker 3>it's an 50 to $80 ebook</v>

332
00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:09.533
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

333
00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.500
<v Speaker 3>and I forget who says this.</v>

334
00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:12.040
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

335
00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:12.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

336
00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.190
<v Speaker 3>it's a thinker that most other people would know,</v>

337
00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:18.450
<v Speaker 3>but they mentioned that it's a,</v>

338
00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:23.950
<v Speaker 3>that it's in an impotent lust for revenge.</v>

339
00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:25.901
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

340
00:12:25.901 --> 00:12:29.290
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like the person knows that they're vulnerable.</v>

341
00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:34.240
<v Speaker 3>Victim knows that they're vulnerable,</v>

342
00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:36.610
<v Speaker 3>but that they can't do anything.</v>

343
00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:41.640
<v Speaker 3>And so their resentment is fueled by their own impotency.</v>

344
00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:43.211
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

345
00:12:43.211 --> 00:12:44.320
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like this,</v>

346
00:12:44.321 --> 00:12:45.154
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

347
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.890
<v Speaker 3>the more whether or not they're,</v>

348
00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:52.780
<v Speaker 3>they feel sorry whether or not a person is wronged.</v>

349
00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:54.940
<v Speaker 3>Like if a person continues to,</v>

350
00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:56.410
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

351
00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:57.243
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

352
00:12:58.210 --> 00:12:59.043
<v Speaker 3>to think</v>

353
00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:01.720
<v Speaker 3>about being victimized,</v>

354
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:02.090
<v Speaker 3>then you know,</v>

355
00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:02.360
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

356
00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.990
<v Speaker 3>they just keep fueling the resentment and it's an,</v>

357
00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:05.910
<v Speaker 3>it's easy.</v>

358
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:06.310
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

359
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:06.551
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

360
00:13:06.551 --> 00:13:07.540
<v Speaker 3>it can easily happen,</v>

361
00:13:07.541 --> 00:13:09.190
<v Speaker 3>especially if you start to,</v>

362
00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:09.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

363
00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.340
<v Speaker 3>like Peterson says you,</v>

364
00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:13.780
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if he says this,</v>

365
00:13:13.781 --> 00:13:14.100
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

366
00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.610
<v Speaker 3>if you keep feeding the dragon,</v>

367
00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:15.971
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

368
00:13:15.971 --> 00:13:20.780
<v Speaker 3>it just keeps getting bigger and bigger and just ignore it too.</v>

369
00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:21.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

370
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:22.600
<v Speaker 3>And if you ignore it,</v>

371
00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:23.500
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

372
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:23.771
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

373
00:13:23.771 --> 00:13:24.604
<v Speaker 3>even if you,</v>

374
00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:29.880
<v Speaker 3>if you can stop for a little while and then continue again later,</v>

375
00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:30.521
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

376
00:13:30.521 --> 00:13:30.970
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

377
00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:33.960
<v Speaker 3>it made the dragon may have gotten smaller but you know,</v>

378
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.480
<v Speaker 3>it's still a drag and then it hasn't completely disappeared yet.</v>

379
00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:43.860
<v Speaker 4>Anything you ignore a will get bigger in the background and we'll start taking</v>

380
00:13:44.111 --> 00:13:45.130
<v Speaker 4>up more and more of your,</v>

381
00:13:45.131 --> 00:13:45.760
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

382
00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.160
<v Speaker 4>your thoughts because you're not dealing with the problem.</v>

383
00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:49.553
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

384
00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:51.040
<v Speaker 4>But also,</v>

385
00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.060
<v Speaker 4>but also if you feed it,</v>

386
00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:55.660
<v Speaker 4>that's also gonna cause problems as well because you know,</v>

387
00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:57.040
<v Speaker 4>if you're adding to it,</v>

388
00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:59.740
<v Speaker 4>you're adding to the problem rather than confronting.</v>

389
00:13:59.741 --> 00:14:01.460
<v Speaker 4>It was really a,</v>

390
00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.220
<v Speaker 4>when you confront resentment,</v>

391
00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:07.270
<v Speaker 4>you're really just confronting yourself and a lot of people don't have the</v>

392
00:14:07.271 --> 00:14:10.180
<v Speaker 4>courage to do that and fair enough,</v>

393
00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:10.480
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

394
00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.590
<v Speaker 4>that's a tough one to do,</v>

395
00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:13.810
<v Speaker 4>but if you want to get better,</v>

396
00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:15.093
<v Speaker 4>you've got to do it.</v>

397
00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:15.881
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

398
00:14:15.881 --> 00:14:16.480
<v Speaker 4>Because,</v>

399
00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:16.751
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

400
00:14:16.751 --> 00:14:17.940
<v Speaker 4>your resentment is,</v>

401
00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:18.970
<v Speaker 4>is personal.</v>

402
00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:22.060
<v Speaker 4>It's all the ways in which,</v>

403
00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:22.810
<v Speaker 4>unless it's,</v>

404
00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:23.470
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

405
00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:25.840
<v Speaker 4>in fueled by ideology.</v>

406
00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.140
<v Speaker 3>And then it may be that,</v>

407
00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:29.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

408
00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:33.000
<v Speaker 3>the idea that there is an idea that's controlling you rather than you.</v>

409
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm expounding an idea,</v>

410
00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:40.590
<v Speaker 3>but let's say that the resentment is personal and there's not an idealogue</v>

411
00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:41.453
<v Speaker 3>driving it.</v>

412
00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:42.853
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

413
00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:44.760
<v Speaker 3>then you really have to,</v>

414
00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:45.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

415
00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:46.081
<v Speaker 3>get a,</v>

416
00:14:46.081 --> 00:14:46.914
<v Speaker 3>hold on it,</v>

417
00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:51.000
<v Speaker 3>get a hold of it and figure out what exactly.</v>

418
00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:53.871
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

419
00:14:53.871 --> 00:14:54.060
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

420
00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:59.060
<v Speaker 4>it seems like Peterson says like the socialists and if he got that from Orwell,</v>

421
00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:01.550
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

422
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:04.220
<v Speaker 4>the Socialists don't love the poor,</v>

423
00:15:04.221 --> 00:15:05.270
<v Speaker 4>they just hate the rich.</v>

424
00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:08.510
<v Speaker 4>And the strange thing with that is that they actually,</v>

425
00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:09.440
<v Speaker 4>they hate the rich,</v>

426
00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.000
<v Speaker 4>but the ideal idealize Islam,</v>

427
00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:14.180
<v Speaker 4>and that's why they hate them because they're resentful of the fact that they're</v>

428
00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:16.160
<v Speaker 4>not rich or you know,</v>

429
00:15:16.161 --> 00:15:18.470
<v Speaker 4>there's some sort of moral quandary with having wealth,</v>

430
00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:20.030
<v Speaker 4>which really there isn't.</v>

431
00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:22.250
<v Speaker 4>The problem is they don't have it.</v>

432
00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:25.040
<v Speaker 4>So they wanted to destroy it and that's like the,</v>

433
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:25.641
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

434
00:15:25.641 --> 00:15:28.070
<v Speaker 4>the typical out difficult.</v>

435
00:15:28.071 --> 00:15:30.340
<v Speaker 4>But the Cain and Abel story is all,</v>

436
00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:31.010
<v Speaker 4>is that,</v>

437
00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:36.010
<v Speaker 4>that's what that can enable story is it's someone who idealized is something and</v>

438
00:15:36.501 --> 00:15:40.310
<v Speaker 4>then tries to destroy it in order to make themselves better.</v>

439
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:43.070
<v Speaker 4>But what happens when you destroy it,</v>

440
00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:45.920
<v Speaker 4>you realize that you've just destroyed your ideal,</v>

441
00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:47.630
<v Speaker 4>which in a sense you've destroyed yourself.</v>

442
00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:49.431
<v Speaker 4>Where your soul is.</v>

443
00:15:49.431 --> 00:15:50.270
<v Speaker 4>The Christians would say,</v>

444
00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:52.803
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

445
00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:53.990
<v Speaker 3>let's just,</v>

446
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:54.823
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

447
00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:56.703
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to continue on.</v>

448
00:15:57.490 --> 00:15:58.323
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

449
00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm at the [inaudible] 37.</v>

450
00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:00.381
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

451
00:16:00.381 --> 00:16:00.760
<v Speaker 3>me too.</v>

452
00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:01.593
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

453
00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:02.630
<v Speaker 3>Fit.</v>

454
00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:04.020
<v Speaker 3>Just fantasies.</v>

455
00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:04.863
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

456
00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:10.910
<v Speaker 1>which you might not want to become conscious of because they're so brutal,</v>

457
00:16:11.071 --> 00:16:11.581
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

458
00:16:11.581 --> 00:16:15.330
<v Speaker 1>And so aggressive that you can't even believe that you generate them the nice</v>

459
00:16:15.331 --> 00:16:15.841
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

460
00:16:15.841 --> 00:16:16.674
<v Speaker 1>That's you.</v>

461
00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:17.251
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

462
00:16:17.251 --> 00:16:21.090
<v Speaker 1>so it's quite frightening to open that door and see all that and that also</v>

463
00:16:21.091 --> 00:16:25.470
<v Speaker 1>associates you with the entire dark shadow of mankind,</v>

464
00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:26.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

465
00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.400
<v Speaker 1>The tannic element of the human character and,</v>

466
00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:32.230
<v Speaker 1>but it opens the door to understanding as well to,</v>

467
00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.700
<v Speaker 1>to understanding how people can do terrible things because you could see</v>

468
00:16:35.701 --> 00:16:38.370
<v Speaker 1>yourself as one of the people who could be positive things.</v>

469
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:39.543
<v Speaker 1>That's through twelfth.</v>

470
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:45.180
<v Speaker 4>So when he says people like they're on aisle,</v>

471
00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:46.790
<v Speaker 4>I've found a lot of people are like,</v>

472
00:16:46.791 --> 00:16:50.150
<v Speaker 4>if you ask them a question that if they're capable of doing a terrible thing,</v>

473
00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:51.350
<v Speaker 4>they'll usually say no,</v>

474
00:16:51.351 --> 00:16:51.591
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

475
00:16:51.591 --> 00:16:52.670
<v Speaker 4>Because there's not a monster,</v>

476
00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:54.290
<v Speaker 4>but that's the problem.</v>

477
00:16:54.291 --> 00:16:58.700
<v Speaker 4>Because if they're a human being and other human beings are capable of doing</v>

478
00:16:58.701 --> 00:16:59.534
<v Speaker 4>that terrible thing,</v>

479
00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:02.270
<v Speaker 4>then automatically you're capable of doing that terrible thing too,</v>

480
00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:03.990
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

481
00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:06.710
<v Speaker 4>The only thing that's stopping you is something,</v>

482
00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:07.993
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

483
00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:09.860
<v Speaker 4>So is it because you're a coward?</v>

484
00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:11.510
<v Speaker 4>Which is what Nietzsche would say,</v>

485
00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:12.531
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

486
00:17:12.531 --> 00:17:17.030
<v Speaker 4>or is it because the laws or is it because you have a reason not to do it?</v>

487
00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:21.170
<v Speaker 4>And if you asked where the resentment thing comes in,</v>

488
00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.370
<v Speaker 4>because maybe your reason is that you,</v>

489
00:17:24.371 --> 00:17:24.621
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

490
00:17:24.621 --> 00:17:25.371
<v Speaker 4>you have resentment,</v>

491
00:17:25.371 --> 00:17:27.170
<v Speaker 4>figured you're dealing with it yourself,</v>

492
00:17:27.171 --> 00:17:30.470
<v Speaker 4>like it's your problem and you're not externalizing it to those things.</v>

493
00:17:30.471 --> 00:17:31.304
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

494
00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:32.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

495
00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:32.710
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

496
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:33.430
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

497
00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:34.263
<v Speaker 3>I read,</v>

498
00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.810
<v Speaker 3>I haven't read police battalion are.</v>

499
00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:39.100
<v Speaker 3>I haven't read ordinary men completely.</v>

500
00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:39.521
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

501
00:17:39.521 --> 00:17:41.390
<v Speaker 3>they haven't even started reading it yet because I was,</v>

502
00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:45.940
<v Speaker 3>I was seeing little excerpts and one of the excerpts that stood out to me was</v>

503
00:17:45.941 --> 00:17:47.950
<v Speaker 3>that a police battalion,</v>

504
00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:49.000
<v Speaker 3>I think it was one on one,</v>

505
00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:50.820
<v Speaker 3>was made up of,</v>

506
00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:53.880
<v Speaker 3>I forget who the author.</v>

507
00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:57.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm a classified three different types of men.</v>

508
00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:01.440
<v Speaker 3>The men who were eager to kill the men who were,</v>

509
00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:03.153
<v Speaker 6>I'm</v>

510
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:06.833
<v Speaker 6>a</v>

511
00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:09.783
<v Speaker 3>who would,</v>

512
00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:14.440
<v Speaker 3>who would kill but weren't initiating the action.</v>

513
00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:16.600
<v Speaker 3>They would have to be initiated against.</v>

514
00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:19.660
<v Speaker 3>They would have to have someone initiate them to kill,</v>

515
00:18:19.661 --> 00:18:21.100
<v Speaker 3>but they would kill willingly.</v>

516
00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:26.720
<v Speaker 3>Then the men who would basically try and avoid the killing.</v>

517
00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:29.560
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

518
00:18:29.561 --> 00:18:30.490
<v Speaker 3>obviously,</v>

519
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

520
00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:35.270
<v Speaker 3>all three groups said we're,</v>

521
00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:37.990
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

522
00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:40.070
<v Speaker 3>we're part of the problem.</v>

523
00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:41.600
<v Speaker 3>Not only part of the problem,</v>

524
00:18:41.601 --> 00:18:42.460
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

525
00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:47.850
<v Speaker 3>I guess I'd have to read it to find out maybe more about the groups</v>

526
00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:50.781
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

527
00:18:50.781 --> 00:18:52.550
<v Speaker 3>Like I have a lot more reading to do.</v>

528
00:18:52.551 --> 00:18:55.100
<v Speaker 3>I've been doing more and more reading over time,</v>

529
00:18:55.101 --> 00:18:55.550
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

530
00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:55.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

531
00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:56.990
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of stuff to read.</v>

532
00:18:56.991 --> 00:18:58.230
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>

533
00:18:58.550 --> 00:18:59.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm just wondering.</v>

534
00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.511
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

535
00:18:59.511 --> 00:19:00.051
<v Speaker 3>I'm wondering,</v>

536
00:19:00.051 --> 00:19:00.884
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

537
00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:06.210
<v Speaker 3>how much some of these individuals were in touch with their own darkness?</v>

538
00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:08.620
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

539
00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:09.110
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

540
00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:09.530
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

541
00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:12.080
<v Speaker 3>I would be hard pressed to think that,</v>

542
00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:12.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

543
00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:15.140
<v Speaker 3>the eager killers were all,</v>

544
00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:16.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

545
00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:18.200
<v Speaker 3>in touch with their own.</v>

546
00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.610
<v Speaker 3>Or maybe they would be the ones in touch with their own darkness,</v>

547
00:19:22.611 --> 00:19:24.530
<v Speaker 3>but they were the ones who continued to feed it.</v>

548
00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:25.461
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

549
00:19:25.461 --> 00:19:26.150
<v Speaker 3>That's the other.</v>

550
00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:29.120
<v Speaker 3>Feeding the dragon rather than integrated into themselves.</v>

551
00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:30.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

552
00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:31.100
<v Speaker 3>If you're,</v>

553
00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:31.580
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>

554
00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:33.440
<v Speaker 3>if you're not really using the tool of consciously,</v>

555
00:19:33.441 --> 00:19:34.220
<v Speaker 3>then then you're,</v>

556
00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:35.510
<v Speaker 3>then you're just feeding the dragon.</v>

557
00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:36.290
<v Speaker 3>If you're.</v>

558
00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:38.180
<v Speaker 3>There's times when you should be a monster,</v>

559
00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:42.970
<v Speaker 3>but if it's like shooting women in the back of the head and open and feels like</v>

560
00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:44.210
<v Speaker 3>that's not really a time,</v>

561
00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:45.960
<v Speaker 3>that's obviously,</v>

562
00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.350
<v Speaker 3>that's obviously a pathological situation,</v>

563
00:19:48.351 --> 00:19:49.184
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

564
00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:52.040
<v Speaker 3>you've got to control it.</v>

565
00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:56.570
<v Speaker 3>And maybe the men who killed willingly because they knew that they had to,</v>

566
00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:58.460
<v Speaker 3>whatever that means.</v>

567
00:19:58.580 --> 00:19:59.400
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

568
00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.220
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

569
00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:00.720
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

570
00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.870
<v Speaker 3>were ones who were in touch,</v>

571
00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:05.330
<v Speaker 3>but because they wouldn't initiate it themselves,</v>

572
00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:07.610
<v Speaker 3>maybe they were ones who,</v>

573
00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:10.130
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

574
00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:11.040
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to say because,</v>

575
00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:11.923
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

576
00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:12.800
<v Speaker 3>Peter.</v>

577
00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:13.131
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

578
00:20:13.131 --> 00:20:14.430
<v Speaker 3>They were following [inaudible] Peterson,</v>

579
00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:14.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

580
00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:15.670
<v Speaker 3>obviously mentioned,</v>

581
00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:17.173
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

582
00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:19.880
<v Speaker 3>when you start to think for yourself that,</v>

583
00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:20.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

584
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:21.520
<v Speaker 3>I could be one of the,</v>

585
00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:23.580
<v Speaker 3>you think to yourself that I can be one of those guards,</v>

586
00:20:23.581 --> 00:20:23.791
<v Speaker 3>w,</v>

587
00:20:23.791 --> 00:20:24.624
<v Speaker 3>w,</v>

588
00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:29.320
<v Speaker 3>what would I have to do to make sure that that would never happen now will,</v>

589
00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:31.370
<v Speaker 3>I don't know because I haven't read the book,</v>

590
00:20:31.371 --> 00:20:36.371
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know of any three of any individual in that group that chose not to.</v>

591
00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:38.811
<v Speaker 3>Or how about this?</v>

592
00:20:38.811 --> 00:20:40.370
<v Speaker 3>Like what would it take?</v>

593
00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:44.000
<v Speaker 3>What would your life have to be like in order to make a decision like that?</v>

594
00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:46.580
<v Speaker 3>Like realistically,</v>

595
00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:48.953
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

596
00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:53.710
<v Speaker 4>that's another question should be asked to because maybe if anybody's capable of</v>

597
00:20:53.711 --> 00:20:54.544
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

598
00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:55.600
<v Speaker 4>it maybe,</v>

599
00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:59.770
<v Speaker 4>maybe it's good to realize what you would have to,</v>

600
00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:04.240
<v Speaker 4>what kind of situation you would have to be in to a reset.</v>

601
00:21:04.241 --> 00:21:05.680
<v Speaker 4>Same sort of decision.</v>

602
00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:06.141
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

603
00:21:06.141 --> 00:21:10.280
<v Speaker 3>That's necessary to even begin thinking about it,</v>

604
00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:10.611
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

605
00:21:10.611 --> 00:21:11.900
<v Speaker 3>to put yourself in that position,</v>

606
00:21:11.901 --> 00:21:12.770
<v Speaker 3>you have to wonder,</v>

607
00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:13.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

608
00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:14.180
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

609
00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:16.220
<v Speaker 3>what situation would I have to be in?</v>

610
00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:21.320
<v Speaker 3>Especially for the people who claim that they could never be in that position</v>

611
00:21:21.321 --> 00:21:23.090
<v Speaker 3>because they're good people.</v>

612
00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:24.863
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

613
00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:26.573
<v Speaker 4>they were good people.</v>

614
00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:27.610
<v Speaker 4>We only killed $100,</v>

615
00:21:27.611 --> 00:21:32.530
<v Speaker 4>million innocent civilians in the 20th century for ideals,</v>

616
00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:33.491
<v Speaker 4>but it was worth it.</v>

617
00:21:33.491 --> 00:21:34.324
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

618
00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:37.450
<v Speaker 4>It's an absolute monsters.</v>

619
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:38.080
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

620
00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:38.651
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't.</v>

621
00:21:38.651 --> 00:21:40.300
<v Speaker 4>If I was in charge of the utopia,</v>

622
00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:42.070
<v Speaker 4>it would have been ushered in.</v>

623
00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:42.461
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

624
00:21:42.461 --> 00:21:46.830
<v Speaker 4>well then what happens to people like you a while you get taken out by the cell</v>

625
00:21:46.831 --> 00:21:47.540
<v Speaker 4>in type system,</v>

626
00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:48.820
<v Speaker 4>what Peterson says anyways.</v>

627
00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:49.893
<v Speaker 4>And that makes sense.</v>

628
00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:50.850
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

629
00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:51.683
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

630
00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:52.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

631
00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:54.320
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to continue to let this go.</v>

632
00:21:54.321 --> 00:21:55.300
<v Speaker 4>I'm at 10 to 12.</v>

633
00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:56.283
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

634
00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:00.163
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

635
00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:01.053
<v Speaker 1>because then you.</v>

636
00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:05.240
<v Speaker 1>Well then maybe you start to be motivated to be the sort of person who wouldn't</v>

637
00:22:05.241 --> 00:22:06.380
<v Speaker 1>do terrible things.</v>

638
00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:06.831
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

639
00:22:06.831 --> 00:22:10.280
<v Speaker 1>if you can really come to terms with the fact that that's part and parcel of</v>

640
00:22:10.281 --> 00:22:10.640
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

641
00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:13.430
<v Speaker 1>It also is some perverse sense.</v>

642
00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:15.650
<v Speaker 1>It's also a discovery of your own strength though,</v>

643
00:22:15.651 --> 00:22:18.980
<v Speaker 1>because you know if you have that desire for aggression,</v>

644
00:22:18.981 --> 00:22:23.981
<v Speaker 1>that desire for destruction and that that ability to fantasize in that</v>

645
00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:25.460
<v Speaker 1>aggressive manner,</v>

646
00:22:25.461 --> 00:22:29.510
<v Speaker 1>it also means that you can incorporate some of that into your speech and into</v>

647
00:22:29.511 --> 00:22:32.720
<v Speaker 1>your actions so that you're a lot more immovable,</v>

648
00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:33.950
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

649
00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:38.360
<v Speaker 1>and and a lot more of a force to contend with.</v>

650
00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:42.050
<v Speaker 1>It can give you some respect for yourself when you realize that you're a force</v>

651
00:22:42.051 --> 00:22:44.240
<v Speaker 1>of destruction as well as creation,</v>

652
00:22:44.241 --> 00:22:48.200
<v Speaker 1>and then you're also more likely to treat yourself with a bit more intelligent.</v>

653
00:22:48.201 --> 00:22:49.034
<v Speaker 1>Caution,</v>

654
00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:49.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

655
00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:54.710
<v Speaker 1>to know that you're a part of you is a ticking bomb in some sense that could go</v>

656
00:22:54.711 --> 00:22:56.300
<v Speaker 1>off and so you,</v>

657
00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:56.900
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

658
00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:01.340
<v Speaker 1>you tried a bit more lightly around yourself and maybe you encourage people to</v>

659
00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:03.250
<v Speaker 1>tread more lightly around you as well.</v>

660
00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:06.191
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

661
00:23:06.191 --> 00:23:08.680
<v Speaker 4>so I know that's too in my life where,</v>

662
00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:09.500
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

663
00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:10.260
<v Speaker 4>if I'm,</v>

664
00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:11.290
<v Speaker 4>if I'm passive,</v>

665
00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:15.070
<v Speaker 4>people sort of tread all over you,</v>

666
00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:20.940
<v Speaker 4>but if you take yourself seriously and you don't let yourself get pushed around</v>

667
00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:23.710
<v Speaker 4>and people read off that too,</v>

668
00:23:23.711 --> 00:23:24.880
<v Speaker 4>and then they treat you better,</v>

669
00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:25.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

670
00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:26.890
<v Speaker 4>they treat you seriously.</v>

671
00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:27.953
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

672
00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:28.970
<v Speaker 4>But I've also found</v>

673
00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:29.401
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

674
00:23:29.401 --> 00:23:29.640
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

675
00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:30.630
<v Speaker 3>sometimes,</v>

676
00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:32.423
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

677
00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:34.800
<v Speaker 3>in my own experiences through work,</v>

678
00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:35.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

679
00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:39.000
<v Speaker 3>a lot of times when I worked in a cabinet shop,</v>

680
00:23:39.001 --> 00:23:39.161
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

681
00:23:39.161 --> 00:23:44.161
<v Speaker 3>I'd be somewhat aggressive sometimes trying to rally people together and some,</v>

682
00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.233
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

683
00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:48.320
<v Speaker 4>more often than not that aggression,</v>

684
00:23:48.321 --> 00:23:48.561
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

685
00:23:48.561 --> 00:23:51.910
<v Speaker 4>it could be a better place.</v>

686
00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:55.280
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to ask somebody for help,</v>

687
00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:56.283
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

688
00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:59.300
<v Speaker 4>and people just thinking,</v>

689
00:23:59.301 --> 00:23:59.590
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

690
00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:00.423
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

691
00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:02.450
<v Speaker 4>we don't have to do that or you know,</v>

692
00:24:02.451 --> 00:24:05.710
<v Speaker 4>that's not required to me or you're not my boss and the,</v>

693
00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:07.880
<v Speaker 4>it would be for the good of the company,</v>

694
00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:08.743
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

695
00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:09.501
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

696
00:24:09.501 --> 00:24:10.291
<v Speaker 4>that's another thing too,</v>

697
00:24:10.291 --> 00:24:14.110
<v Speaker 4>is like you have to match it with your perceived competence competency to,</v>

698
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:15.463
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

699
00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:17.330
<v Speaker 4>if you've earned sort of the,</v>

700
00:24:17.331 --> 00:24:18.164
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

701
00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:20.720
<v Speaker 4>if you've earned your stripes so to speak.</v>

702
00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:24.530
<v Speaker 4>I find that people are way more willing to take you seriously.</v>

703
00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:25.460
<v Speaker 4>Like I've,</v>

704
00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:27.710
<v Speaker 4>I've worked in two different trades.</v>

705
00:24:27.711 --> 00:24:32.300
<v Speaker 4>I've been a carpenter and I've been a nominal electric later and uh,</v>

706
00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:35.150
<v Speaker 4>I was a young guy so I had no experience.</v>

707
00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:39.440
<v Speaker 4>I had very little knowledge by just kind of like did all the hard work and</v>

708
00:24:39.441 --> 00:24:42.170
<v Speaker 4>eventually an ass a lot of questions and eventually they're like,</v>

709
00:24:42.171 --> 00:24:43.004
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

710
00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:46.640
<v Speaker 4>They started taking it more seriously and I got my apprenticeship and stuff.</v>

711
00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:51.170
<v Speaker 4>And then I met six months later I moved to a different trade altogether,</v>

712
00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:52.910
<v Speaker 4>but I just kept trying to move up.</v>

713
00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:54.300
<v Speaker 4>But my point is,</v>

714
00:24:54.301 --> 00:24:56.830
<v Speaker 4>is that by getting up,</v>

715
00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:59.600
<v Speaker 4>I actually jumped ahead of other guys that were,</v>

716
00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:00.270
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

717
00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:01.130
<v Speaker 4>also apprentices,</v>

718
00:25:01.131 --> 00:25:04.580
<v Speaker 4>but there were there longer because my work ethic pushed me into a more</v>

719
00:25:04.581 --> 00:25:05.630
<v Speaker 4>respectable position.</v>

720
00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.510
<v Speaker 4>So when I would mention something they would take it seriously,</v>

721
00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:09.950
<v Speaker 4>which was also helpful.</v>

722
00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:13.970
<v Speaker 4>But I haven't been in the other position to where I'm trying to bring up ideas</v>

723
00:25:13.971 --> 00:25:18.800
<v Speaker 4>and I have an earned my stripes yet I'm kind of too incompetent to like make a</v>

724
00:25:18.801 --> 00:25:22.330
<v Speaker 4>change and then people just ignore you or whatever.</v>

725
00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:23.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

726
00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:25.220
<v Speaker 4>I find it much more tough when you're a,</v>

727
00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:26.281
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

728
00:25:26.281 --> 00:25:31.281
<v Speaker 4>you work longer and your competency level is already fairly high.</v>

729
00:25:31.481 --> 00:25:34.370
<v Speaker 4>But know people aren't necessarily.</v>

730
00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:38.510
<v Speaker 4>Well you might have a high.</v>

731
00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:41.670
<v Speaker 4>But I'm not that I'm talking to myself up,</v>

732
00:25:41.671 --> 00:25:41.880
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

733
00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:42.121
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

734
00:25:42.121 --> 00:25:44.220
<v Speaker 4>I guess there's always different situations.</v>

735
00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:44.880
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

736
00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:45.350
<v Speaker 4>but we'll have,</v>

737
00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

738
00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:48.560
<v Speaker 4>what exactly do you think Peterson means by integrating,</v>

739
00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:49.730
<v Speaker 4>integrating it,</v>

740
00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:54.300
<v Speaker 4>your speech by what you're saying by basically taking yourself seriously and not</v>

741
00:25:54.301 --> 00:25:54.871
<v Speaker 4>being passive.</v>

742
00:25:54.871 --> 00:25:56.970
<v Speaker 4>Like what would be an example you think of?</v>

743
00:25:58.060 --> 00:25:58.801
<v Speaker 4>Like for example,</v>

744
00:25:58.801 --> 00:26:00.360
<v Speaker 4>when I was working in carpentry,</v>

745
00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:02.520
<v Speaker 4>did we ever doing a garage for a,</v>

746
00:26:02.521 --> 00:26:03.090
<v Speaker 4>a big,</v>

747
00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:04.380
<v Speaker 4>a large residential building?</v>

748
00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:05.860
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

749
00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:10.860
<v Speaker 4>I noticed that my cousin was actually contracted us the person to do the roofing</v>

750
00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:14.130
<v Speaker 4>and stealing and stuff of all the concrete.</v>

751
00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:19.140
<v Speaker 4>And I noticed that one of the walls on the parking garage wasn't sealed with</v>

752
00:26:19.141 --> 00:26:19.974
<v Speaker 4>tar.</v>

753
00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:21.600
<v Speaker 4>And I've mentioned that to my,</v>

754
00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:22.321
<v Speaker 4>I was an apprentice,</v>

755
00:26:22.321 --> 00:26:25.800
<v Speaker 4>so I mentioned to my carpenter a journeyman and he's like,</v>

756
00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:26.071
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>

757
00:26:26.071 --> 00:26:26.904
<v Speaker 4>that makes sense.</v>

758
00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:28.110
<v Speaker 4>Normally as he called me.</v>

759
00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:31.650
<v Speaker 4>And so I went and got tempted to talk to her.</v>

760
00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:34.410
<v Speaker 4>He went and went and talked to the superintendent and the Superintendent said,</v>

761
00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:34.711
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

762
00:26:34.711 --> 00:26:35.970
<v Speaker 4>now we don't need to worry about it.</v>

763
00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:37.800
<v Speaker 4>So then they fill it in,</v>

764
00:26:37.801 --> 00:26:38.011
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

765
00:26:38.011 --> 00:26:39.240
<v Speaker 4>Because they're almost like the space.</v>

766
00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:44.210
<v Speaker 4>And I fill that in with backfill and down over the weekend it and all the water.</v>

767
00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:47.370
<v Speaker 4>Although water from the rain soaked through the concrete and was like,</v>

768
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:48.300
<v Speaker 4>that's a huge problem,</v>

769
00:26:48.301 --> 00:26:48.660
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

770
00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:49.493
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

771
00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:52.830
<v Speaker 4>So they had to take it all out and then we seal the whole thing,</v>

772
00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:55.440
<v Speaker 4>which would have been solved already if they listened to me,</v>

773
00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:58.320
<v Speaker 4>but they didn't listen to me because I was just a dumb apprentice by this.</v>

774
00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:01.260
<v Speaker 4>Noted that there was a problem and I had,</v>

775
00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:02.280
<v Speaker 4>I thought of a solution.</v>

776
00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:05.820
<v Speaker 4>So I presented it and my journeymen thought it was a good idea.</v>

777
00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:08.700
<v Speaker 4>So he passed it on and then they didn't take it seriously,</v>

778
00:27:08.701 --> 00:27:09.960
<v Speaker 4>but then they had to fix it anyways.</v>

779
00:27:09.961 --> 00:27:11.040
<v Speaker 4>So it cost them lots of money.</v>

780
00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:12.913
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that.</v>

781
00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:14.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

782
00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.630
<v Speaker 4>But because I did something like that,</v>

783
00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:16.340
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

784
00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:16.980
<v Speaker 4>they'd take me.</v>

785
00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:18.300
<v Speaker 4>It started taking more seriously.</v>

786
00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:19.440
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

787
00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:19.921
<v Speaker 4>fair enough.</v>

788
00:27:19.921 --> 00:27:20.041
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

789
00:27:20.041 --> 00:27:22.440
<v Speaker 4>You don't want like there's a bunch of young idiots out there that think they</v>

790
00:27:22.441 --> 00:27:23.274
<v Speaker 4>know everything,</v>

791
00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:26.760
<v Speaker 4>which is like the first day when you think the.</v>

792
00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:31.680
<v Speaker 4>So they say the Delphi of the Oracle of Delphi said that socrates was the wisest</v>

793
00:27:31.681 --> 00:27:33.960
<v Speaker 4>of the Greeks because he alone movie knew nothing.</v>

794
00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:35.640
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

795
00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:36.473
<v Speaker 4>this true,</v>

796
00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:37.800
<v Speaker 4>the more you know,</v>

797
00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:38.971
<v Speaker 4>the more you know,</v>

798
00:27:38.971 --> 00:27:39.804
<v Speaker 4>you don't know.</v>

799
00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:43.980
<v Speaker 4>So this sort of a good thing to keep in mind.</v>

800
00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:47.520
<v Speaker 4>You gotta know if you're competent before you try to make change,</v>

801
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:48.833
<v Speaker 4>which a lot of people are like,</v>

802
00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:49.650
<v Speaker 4>Eh,</v>

803
00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:50.483
<v Speaker 4>I don't need to do that.</v>

804
00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:53.940
<v Speaker 4>So they just go out and run around like a bull in a China shop and no one takes</v>

805
00:27:53.941 --> 00:27:56.010
<v Speaker 4>them seriously because why would you?</v>

806
00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:57.560
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

807
00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:58.393
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

808
00:27:58.920 --> 00:27:59.041
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

809
00:27:59.041 --> 00:28:00.090
<v Speaker 4>That makes a lot of sense.</v>

810
00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:01.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

811
00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:02.730
<v Speaker 4>I think that's what Peterson means with a.</v>

812
00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:04.051
<v Speaker 4>When he says like,</v>

813
00:28:04.051 --> 00:28:05.430
<v Speaker 4>make you clean your room,</v>

814
00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:10.580
<v Speaker 4>it's a prove to yourself that you have competency to do so because if you can't</v>

815
00:28:11.461 --> 00:28:11.941
<v Speaker 4>do that,</v>

816
00:28:11.941 --> 00:28:16.920
<v Speaker 4>then maybe you should reassess your own competency and it's people make fun of</v>

817
00:28:16.921 --> 00:28:18.120
<v Speaker 4>it because it's like silly,</v>

818
00:28:18.121 --> 00:28:18.954
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

819
00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:23.760
<v Speaker 4>But the point is is you're supposed to test your competency competency or making</v>

820
00:28:23.761 --> 00:28:26.250
<v Speaker 4>a room and then you test your competency and other things.</v>

821
00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:29.100
<v Speaker 4>Maybe keeping your house clean and uh,</v>

822
00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.520
<v Speaker 4>and then try to realize that if you know that you're competent,</v>

823
00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:37.670
<v Speaker 4>then you have the confidence in your speech and the precision of your speech to</v>

824
00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:41.370
<v Speaker 4>make a bigger suggestions more,</v>

825
00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:41.790
<v Speaker 4>more,</v>

826
00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:46.320
<v Speaker 4>more worldly inside your family or inside your friend circle or your work</v>

827
00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:47.970
<v Speaker 4>outside of your own personal life.</v>

828
00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:52.260
<v Speaker 4>Maybe then you could have some confidence in your competency because otherwise,</v>

829
00:28:52.261 --> 00:28:52.860
<v Speaker 4>what are you,</v>

830
00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:53.100
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

831
00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:53.933
<v Speaker 4>You're just,</v>

832
00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:56.370
<v Speaker 4>you could just be any random joe with that ideas.</v>

833
00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:58.230
<v Speaker 4>And are they supposed to take everyone seriously?</v>

834
00:28:58.310 --> 00:29:00.930
<v Speaker 4>It was too many people know to do that.</v>

835
00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:02.003
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

836
00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:02.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

837
00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:06.750
<v Speaker 4>So that's why you're saying it's important to prove to yourself that you have</v>

838
00:29:06.751 --> 00:29:07.584
<v Speaker 4>competency.</v>

839
00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:09.690
<v Speaker 4>That's what the whole cleaning room thing is</v>

840
00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:12.423
<v Speaker 4>least in my opinion.</v>

841
00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:14.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

842
00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:14.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

843
00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:16.030
<v Speaker 4>He tied it together nicely.</v>

844
00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:18.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

845
00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:18.730
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

846
00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:18.911
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

847
00:29:18.911 --> 00:29:19.601
<v Speaker 4>do you want to keep going?</v>

848
00:29:19.601 --> 00:29:19.930
<v Speaker 4>We got it.</v>

849
00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:20.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

850
00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:21.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

851
00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:21.341
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

852
00:29:21.341 --> 00:29:22.660
<v Speaker 4>I got a three.</v>

853
00:29:22.661 --> 00:29:23.840
<v Speaker 4>18 almost started up.</v>

854
00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:25.113
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

855
00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:25.691
<v Speaker 4>well did.</v>

856
00:29:25.691 --> 00:29:27.160
<v Speaker 4>I really admired that.</v>

857
00:29:27.161 --> 00:29:32.161
<v Speaker 4>I know have a clearly dangerous side and you don't want to get,</v>

858
00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:35.950
<v Speaker 4>you don't want to have that activated any more than necessary,</v>

859
00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:38.830
<v Speaker 4>but it's also what makes them respectable and strong,</v>

860
00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:40.690
<v Speaker 4>especially if they have that under control.</v>

861
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:42.063
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

862
00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:42.930
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

863
00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:45.310
<v Speaker 1>that's a bit of a dialogue about shadow integration.</v>

864
00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:46.323
<v Speaker 1>It's a very</v>

865
00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:50.380
<v Speaker 1>challenging undertaking,</v>

866
00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:50.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

867
00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:55.830
<v Speaker 1>to pull in that dark side of your character and that would be all the things</v>

868
00:29:56.801 --> 00:30:01.801
<v Speaker 1>that you've repressed or failed to develop as a consequence of trying to be a</v>

869
00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:04.300
<v Speaker 1>harmless and uh,</v>

870
00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:06.630
<v Speaker 1>well let's say harmless,</v>

871
00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:11.980
<v Speaker 1>harmless citizen who looks virtuous on the surface.</v>

872
00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:13.660
<v Speaker 1>That's the union persona.</v>

873
00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:18.490
<v Speaker 1>And you need that because everybody needs a mask that they wear in public,</v>

874
00:30:18.491 --> 00:30:19.324
<v Speaker 1>like a suit,</v>

875
00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:19.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

876
00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:24.040
<v Speaker 1>so that we can tolerate seeing each other on the street.</v>

877
00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:28.270
<v Speaker 1>We don't have to look right into our depths every time we interact you need that</v>

878
00:30:28.271 --> 00:30:28.841
<v Speaker 1>persona,</v>

879
00:30:28.841 --> 00:30:32.290
<v Speaker 1>but now it has to be transcendent.</v>

880
00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:35.500
<v Speaker 1>And the way to transcend that is to integrate.</v>

881
00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:40.740
<v Speaker 1>The darker parts of the character are very useful demand.</v>

882
00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:41.613
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

883
00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:45.550
<v Speaker 4>I've noticed that if you see like sjws how they dress,</v>

884
00:30:45.551 --> 00:30:46.384
<v Speaker 4>they always stressed with like,</v>

885
00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:47.223
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

886
00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:49.240
<v Speaker 4>kind of unconventionally a lot of the time.</v>

887
00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:49.991
<v Speaker 4>Not all of them do,</v>

888
00:30:49.991 --> 00:30:54.010
<v Speaker 4>but sort of the crazy ones do I haven't seen,</v>

889
00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:54.401
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

890
00:30:54.401 --> 00:30:57.190
<v Speaker 4>other than some of the protests that Peterson has been at.</v>

891
00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:58.181
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

892
00:30:58.181 --> 00:30:58.511
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

893
00:30:58.511 --> 00:30:59.620
<v Speaker 4>I kind of know what you're talking about.</v>

894
00:30:59.621 --> 00:31:00.454
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

895
00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:01.270
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

896
00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:02.180
<v Speaker 4>So that,</v>

897
00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:05.620
<v Speaker 4>that's sort of like the reason why they do that is because they're trying to be</v>

898
00:31:05.621 --> 00:31:06.460
<v Speaker 4>unconventional,</v>

899
00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:09.070
<v Speaker 4>but the result and uh,</v>

900
00:31:09.071 --> 00:31:11.450
<v Speaker 4>the results and feelings from a,</v>

901
00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:16.060
<v Speaker 4>I guess people that are conventional as they see sort of see sort of the chaos</v>

902
00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:18.280
<v Speaker 4>in their own minds being expressed.</v>

903
00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:18.850
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

904
00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:23.850
<v Speaker 4>So they show themselves as incompetent and then they show themselves further and</v>

905
00:31:24.581 --> 00:31:25.990
<v Speaker 4>competent in the way they speak.</v>

906
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.580
<v Speaker 4>So when they cry and like that,</v>

907
00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:33.400
<v Speaker 4>there's like those memes of people crying when trump was elected or sworn in or</v>

908
00:31:33.401 --> 00:31:34.130
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

909
00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:34.840
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

910
00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:36.550
<v Speaker 4>and it just,</v>

911
00:31:36.551 --> 00:31:39.490
<v Speaker 4>like these people are showing,</v>

912
00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:41.710
<v Speaker 4>their masks are falling off essentially,</v>

913
00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:45.050
<v Speaker 4>and it's important to have those masks,</v>

914
00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:46.180
<v Speaker 4>like when,</v>

915
00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:46.930
<v Speaker 4>if you're coming,</v>

916
00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:51.930
<v Speaker 4>if you come across someone that's like dressed shabbily and they smell and uh,</v>

917
00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:53.050
<v Speaker 4>they're not,</v>

918
00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:53.770
<v Speaker 4>they're sort of,</v>

919
00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:55.030
<v Speaker 4>I guess you could say unconventional,</v>

920
00:31:55.031 --> 00:31:56.410
<v Speaker 4>but really they just have poor hygiene.</v>

921
00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:58.450
<v Speaker 4>Your art kind of put off,</v>

922
00:31:58.540 --> 00:31:58.870
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

923
00:31:58.870 --> 00:31:59.590
<v Speaker 4>You don't watch it.</v>

924
00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:00.900
<v Speaker 4>They might interact with light,</v>

925
00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:02.680
<v Speaker 4>but you're going to try to avoid them.</v>

926
00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:03.970
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

927
00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:04.803
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

928
00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:06.033
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

929
00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:08.040
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

930
00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:08.500
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

931
00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:08.690
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

932
00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:09.401
<v Speaker 4>I wonder,</v>

933
00:32:09.401 --> 00:32:10.234
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

934
00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:13.681
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

935
00:32:13.681 --> 00:32:15.600
<v Speaker 4>I think I'll start looking for that more.</v>

936
00:32:15.601 --> 00:32:19.380
<v Speaker 4>I definitely can say I have seen that in some of the people that stick out in my</v>

937
00:32:19.381 --> 00:32:20.520
<v Speaker 4>head and some of the videos,</v>

938
00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:22.021
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

939
00:32:22.021 --> 00:32:25.440
<v Speaker 4>like if you've come across sort of like a homeless guy and if you stare at him,</v>

940
00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:27.170
<v Speaker 4>like he might start freaking out at you,</v>

941
00:32:27.171 --> 00:32:28.004
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

942
00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:30.130
<v Speaker 4>Because you're,</v>

943
00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:35.480
<v Speaker 4>you're seeing him for what as he is and he's probably a little bit embarrassed</v>

944
00:32:35.581 --> 00:32:35.881
<v Speaker 4>by that.</v>

945
00:32:35.881 --> 00:32:40.881
<v Speaker 4>So he might come at you or he might yell at you or he show his chaos and which</v>

946
00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:44.510
<v Speaker 4>stocks because you don't want to treat people like that,</v>

947
00:32:44.511 --> 00:32:47.090
<v Speaker 4>but that's just the way things are sometimes.</v>

948
00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:48.320
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

949
00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:48.641
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

950
00:32:48.641 --> 00:32:52.400
<v Speaker 4>it's important if you want to see another important side of this competency</v>

951
00:32:52.401 --> 00:32:56.090
<v Speaker 4>thing is you got to appear competent because people might not know and if you</v>

952
00:32:56.091 --> 00:32:58.400
<v Speaker 4>show that you can appear competent,</v>

953
00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:02.050
<v Speaker 4>then people are more likely to want to interact with you because they're going</v>

954
00:33:02.051 --> 00:33:02.630
<v Speaker 4>to see you.</v>

955
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:03.410
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

956
00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:06.830
<v Speaker 4>that's a more peaceful person I guess in some way because they're going to be</v>

957
00:33:06.831 --> 00:33:07.551
<v Speaker 4>able to know that,</v>

958
00:33:07.551 --> 00:33:07.821
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

959
00:33:07.821 --> 00:33:08.031
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

960
00:33:08.031 --> 00:33:10.280
<v Speaker 4>if a person's able to take care of themselves hygienically,</v>

961
00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:11.930
<v Speaker 4>then you know,</v>

962
00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:16.160
<v Speaker 4>maybe I can have an actual conversation with this person compared to a guy going</v>

963
00:33:16.161 --> 00:33:18.290
<v Speaker 4>to be covered in actual garbage.</v>

964
00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:19.910
<v Speaker 4>Then this can be difficult,</v>

965
00:33:19.911 --> 00:33:20.121
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

966
00:33:20.121 --> 00:33:21.620
<v Speaker 4>Because you're going to be constantly smelling or,</v>

967
00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:22.513
<v Speaker 4>or whatever.</v>

968
00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:23.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

969
00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:23.993
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

970
00:33:25.290 --> 00:33:27.650
<v Speaker 4>don't know how much it's hearsay or where it came from,</v>

971
00:33:27.651 --> 00:33:29.260
<v Speaker 4>but I heard that Marx was a.</v>

972
00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:30.710
<v Speaker 4>was it pretty dirty,</v>

973
00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:32.473
<v Speaker 4>dirty person?</v>

974
00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:33.403
<v Speaker 4>Smelled,</v>

975
00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:34.420
<v Speaker 4>or we call them,</v>

976
00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:35.240
<v Speaker 4>we call them,</v>

977
00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:36.590
<v Speaker 4>I call them dirty Santa Claus.</v>

978
00:33:39.370 --> 00:33:42.650
<v Speaker 4>Man filled with resentment is so,</v>

979
00:33:42.651 --> 00:33:46.010
<v Speaker 4>so resentful that he almost started his own children who really.</v>

980
00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:47.583
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

981
00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:49.550
<v Speaker 4>Well it doesn't even have a job.</v>

982
00:33:49.551 --> 00:33:51.830
<v Speaker 4>So he wasn't really keeping up with the Miller,</v>

983
00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:52.760
<v Speaker 4>isn't he really is the only,</v>

984
00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:55.700
<v Speaker 4>only reason he was able to like get by lists because angles,</v>

985
00:33:55.730 --> 00:34:00.730
<v Speaker 4>who was a son of a rich industrialists was sending him money basically</v>

986
00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:03.073
<v Speaker 6>and uh,</v>

987
00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:05.060
<v Speaker 4>to help him with his writings.</v>

988
00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:06.530
<v Speaker 4>I suppose that's,</v>

989
00:34:06.531 --> 00:34:09.850
<v Speaker 4>that's the only reason why otherwise I think he had like four or five kids.</v>

990
00:34:09.851 --> 00:34:10.571
<v Speaker 4>Don't quote me on that,</v>

991
00:34:10.571 --> 00:34:11.790
<v Speaker 4>but yeah.</v>

992
00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:12.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

993
00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:16.290
<v Speaker 4>Didn't you horror on his own wife to A.</v>

994
00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:16.931
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

995
00:34:16.931 --> 00:34:18.670
<v Speaker 4>I can't say if that's true or not.</v>

996
00:34:18.671 --> 00:34:19.504
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

997
00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:20.373
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

998
00:34:20.410 --> 00:34:20.790
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

999
00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:21.320
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1000
00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:22.153
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

1001
00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:24.850
<v Speaker 4>Don't want to pick on somebody that can't defend themselves anymore.</v>

1002
00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:29.010
<v Speaker 4>I want to start again at 4:32.</v>

1003
00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:30.280
<v Speaker 4>Only a little bit left.</v>

1004
00:34:30.281 --> 00:34:30.630
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

1005
00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:30.850
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1006
00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:31.683
<v Speaker 4>I'll start up.</v>

1007
00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:35.260
<v Speaker 4>That's very difficult to socialize that competitiveness,</v>

1008
00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:40.330
<v Speaker 4>but unbelievably useful in terms of force and the character if you could manage</v>

1009
00:34:40.331 --> 00:34:41.164
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1010
00:34:42.910 --> 00:34:43.743
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1011
00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:44.411
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1012
00:34:44.411 --> 00:34:45.660
<v Speaker 4>I think a sane socialized,</v>

1013
00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:46.780
<v Speaker 4>socializing the competitiveness,</v>

1014
00:34:46.781 --> 00:34:51.470
<v Speaker 4>that's has a lot to do with what you were talking about with competency and</v>

1015
00:34:52.210 --> 00:34:53.043
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1016
00:34:53.830 --> 00:34:54.663
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1017
00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:56.250
<v Speaker 4>if you are competitive,</v>

1018
00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:56.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1019
00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:01.200
<v Speaker 4>a great thing to do is first to appear competent so that you can</v>

1020
00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:05.920
<v Speaker 4>display your competitiveness with some.</v>

1021
00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:08.953
<v Speaker 6>Perfect.</v>

1022
00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:10.020
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what I'm saying.</v>

1023
00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:11.250
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1024
00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:11.940
<v Speaker 4>when I was,</v>

1025
00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:12.571
<v Speaker 4>when I was younger,</v>

1026
00:35:12.571 --> 00:35:13.530
<v Speaker 4>I used to think I was really,</v>

1027
00:35:13.531 --> 00:35:14.221
<v Speaker 4>really competent.</v>

1028
00:35:14.221 --> 00:35:14.491
<v Speaker 4>Like I,</v>

1029
00:35:14.491 --> 00:35:15.980
<v Speaker 4>I thought I knew everything right.</v>

1030
00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:21.120
<v Speaker 4>Which you don't really understand like when you're 18 and you think you know</v>

1031
00:35:21.121 --> 00:35:21.660
<v Speaker 4>everything,</v>

1032
00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:24.000
<v Speaker 4>you don't realize how little you actually know.</v>

1033
00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:25.163
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1034
00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:26.790
<v Speaker 4>So what I was,</v>

1035
00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:30.960
<v Speaker 4>what I would I changed over time was I just started reading more and then I</v>

1036
00:35:30.961 --> 00:35:32.070
<v Speaker 4>started realizing I'm like,</v>

1037
00:35:32.071 --> 00:35:32.611
<v Speaker 4>Oh shit,</v>

1038
00:35:32.611 --> 00:35:33.180
<v Speaker 4>I almost,</v>

1039
00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:36.210
<v Speaker 4>I know almost nothing about the more I've read,</v>

1040
00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:37.383
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1041
00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:38.700
<v Speaker 4>the more I realized that,</v>

1042
00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:40.110
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1043
00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:41.280
<v Speaker 4>but there's like 17,</v>

1044
00:35:41.281 --> 00:35:41.581
<v Speaker 4>18,</v>

1045
00:35:41.581 --> 00:35:42.450
<v Speaker 4>19 year old kid,</v>

1046
00:35:42.451 --> 00:35:46.080
<v Speaker 4>sometimes 20 year olds that are out there protesting and they don't really know</v>

1047
00:35:46.081 --> 00:35:47.070
<v Speaker 4>what the hell they're protesting.</v>

1048
00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:51.360
<v Speaker 4>Like you can even see it in even Peterson and his history.</v>

1049
00:35:51.361 --> 00:35:54.030
<v Speaker 4>He's been in this situation where he was,</v>

1050
00:35:54.031 --> 00:35:54.750
<v Speaker 4>he ran for healing,</v>

1051
00:35:54.750 --> 00:35:55.980
<v Speaker 4>he was like 16 or something.</v>

1052
00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:57.690
<v Speaker 4>I ran for the vice president of the,</v>

1053
00:35:57.691 --> 00:36:00.390
<v Speaker 4>a new Democratic Party in Alberta,</v>

1054
00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:02.310
<v Speaker 4>which is the Socialist Party,</v>

1055
00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:04.440
<v Speaker 4>sort of democratic socialist party in Canada.</v>

1056
00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:10.650
<v Speaker 4>And I was also a member of that party and I used to like do campaigning for a</v>

1057
00:36:10.651 --> 00:36:15.651
<v Speaker 4>couple of the people that are eventually won seats and I was like a campaign</v>

1058
00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:18.160
<v Speaker 4>called captain or whatever have a section of the,</v>

1059
00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:19.043
<v Speaker 4>of the city.</v>

1060
00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:20.580
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1061
00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:21.241
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was fine.</v>

1062
00:36:21.241 --> 00:36:22.200
<v Speaker 4>It was interesting experience,</v>

1063
00:36:22.201 --> 00:36:23.160
<v Speaker 4>but now I look back on it.</v>

1064
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:24.570
<v Speaker 4>There was a lot of Weirdos in that,</v>

1065
00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:25.590
<v Speaker 4>in that grouping.</v>

1066
00:36:25.590 --> 00:36:29.640
<v Speaker 4>Like there's a lot of people that they weren't very competent,</v>

1067
00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:31.440
<v Speaker 4>but they thought they knew everything.</v>

1068
00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:32.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1069
00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:33.170
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1070
00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:34.860
<v Speaker 4>and that's the dangerous combination.</v>

1071
00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:39.990
<v Speaker 4>I'm actually remembering a couple of times in my own hometown where I had seen</v>

1072
00:36:39.991 --> 00:36:40.120
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

1073
00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:40.570
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

1074
00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:42.210
<v Speaker 4>a random group that had popped up,</v>

1075
00:36:42.211 --> 00:36:43.380
<v Speaker 4>but Lyndon Larouche group,</v>

1076
00:36:43.381 --> 00:36:47.400
<v Speaker 4>which was like a halfway between a conspiracy theory group.</v>

1077
00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:48.233
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

1078
00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:49.801
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

1079
00:36:49.801 --> 00:36:52.860
<v Speaker 4>I don't know exactly how to more like a cult.</v>

1080
00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:53.820
<v Speaker 4>A cult would be a good,</v>

1081
00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:56.430
<v Speaker 4>a good way to define them,</v>

1082
00:36:56.490 --> 00:37:01.490
<v Speaker 4>but I remember a lot of the people and I know I'm harping on it again,</v>

1083
00:37:02.071 --> 00:37:05.070
<v Speaker 4>but we're dressed up and dressed really odd.</v>

1084
00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:06.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1085
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:07.590
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of them were,</v>

1086
00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:08.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1087
00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:10.230
<v Speaker 4>as old as me and it was just a,</v>

1088
00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:11.191
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1089
00:37:11.191 --> 00:37:15.030
<v Speaker 4>I had approached the table because they were just at the local post office and I</v>

1090
00:37:15.031 --> 00:37:18.060
<v Speaker 4>was there for something and I'm thinking to myself like,</v>

1091
00:37:18.061 --> 00:37:19.260
<v Speaker 4>these guys are a little bit weird.</v>

1092
00:37:19.261 --> 00:37:21.680
<v Speaker 4>So I grabbed the brochure and started looking at it and you know,</v>

1093
00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:22.411
<v Speaker 4>so you know,</v>

1094
00:37:22.411 --> 00:37:24.890
<v Speaker 4>some of the literature sound good?</v>

1095
00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:26.890
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1096
00:37:26.890 --> 00:37:28.780
<v Speaker 4>It seems interesting on the surface,</v>

1097
00:37:28.781 --> 00:37:29.850
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

1098
00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:32.110
<v Speaker 4>just judging by the people who are already there,</v>

1099
00:37:32.111 --> 00:37:35.080
<v Speaker 4>it's like I don't think I want to get involved with these people.</v>

1100
00:37:35.081 --> 00:37:38.230
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of funny how that's kind of habits unconscious.</v>

1101
00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:40.980
<v Speaker 4>Something you picked up unconsciously.</v>

1102
00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:42.101
<v Speaker 4>It might.</v>

1103
00:37:42.101 --> 00:37:42.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1104
00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:42.790
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1105
00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:43.150
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1106
00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:43.960
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1107
00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:45.550
<v Speaker 4>it's funny because it stares you right in the face,</v>

1108
00:37:45.551 --> 00:37:49.690
<v Speaker 4>but it's still sort of unconscious because you give them this era of respect</v>

1109
00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:54.100
<v Speaker 4>that they may not deserve a automatically because you know,</v>

1110
00:37:54.130 --> 00:37:56.110
<v Speaker 4>that's a way to have a peaceful society,</v>

1111
00:37:56.380 --> 00:38:00.570
<v Speaker 4>but unconsciously maybe subconsciously or unconsciously you,</v>

1112
00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:01.910
<v Speaker 4>you see the,</v>

1113
00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:02.350
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1114
00:38:02.350 --> 00:38:03.250
<v Speaker 4>something's up with them.</v>

1115
00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:04.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1116
00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:06.170
<v Speaker 4>Subconsciously I think it was the word I was looking for.</v>

1117
00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:08.830
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure what the proper terminology is.</v>

1118
00:38:08.831 --> 00:38:09.551
<v Speaker 4>That as again,</v>

1119
00:38:09.551 --> 00:38:10.420
<v Speaker 4>I'm not educated.</v>

1120
00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:12.393
<v Speaker 4>I just read a lot.</v>

1121
00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:13.653
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1122
00:38:13.810 --> 00:38:14.411
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

1123
00:38:14.411 --> 00:38:18.040
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting you see it with a scientology people too sometimes,</v>

1124
00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:18.860
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1125
00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:19.693
<v Speaker 4>still crazy.</v>

1126
00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:21.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1127
00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:21.963
<v Speaker 4>I've never,</v>

1128
00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:24.070
<v Speaker 4>I've never come across anybody in scientology.</v>

1129
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:26.990
<v Speaker 4>They have a chapter in Vancouver,</v>

1130
00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:28.640
<v Speaker 4>in the poor area,</v>

1131
00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:32.540
<v Speaker 4>like we're a lot of the homeless people live now and I don't know exactly how</v>

1132
00:38:32.541 --> 00:38:33.050
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1133
00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:35.860
<v Speaker 4>maybe they survived because almost pick of the money,</v>

1134
00:38:35.861 --> 00:38:38.680
<v Speaker 4>which I think could be kind of a bad marketing plan.</v>

1135
00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:39.610
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1136
00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:40.443
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

1137
00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:40.961
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1138
00:38:40.961 --> 00:38:42.610
<v Speaker 4>they're right in the middle of the downtown east side,</v>

1139
00:38:42.611 --> 00:38:43.570
<v Speaker 4>like right beside the unit.</v>

1140
00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:44.830
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever heard of Mark Emery?</v>

1141
00:38:44.831 --> 00:38:45.664
<v Speaker 4>The principal?</v>

1142
00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:47.313
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1143
00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:47.951
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1144
00:38:47.951 --> 00:38:48.101
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1145
00:38:48.101 --> 00:38:52.060
<v Speaker 4>he has a store downtown or he did back in the day called cannabis culture or</v>

1146
00:38:52.061 --> 00:38:55.570
<v Speaker 4>something and it was like right beside the scientology office,</v>

1147
00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:57.360
<v Speaker 4>which I thought was funny because Mark Emery,</v>

1148
00:38:57.390 --> 00:38:59.070
<v Speaker 4>he's the kind of guy that would get,</v>

1149
00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:02.110
<v Speaker 4>you would expect him to make sort of like a pot centric,</v>

1150
00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:03.343
<v Speaker 4>a religion.</v>

1151
00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:03.820
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1152
00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:04.653
<v Speaker 4>ironically,</v>

1153
00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:05.231
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1154
00:39:05.231 --> 00:39:05.530
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1155
00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:06.530
<v Speaker 4>he wouldn't have that.</v>

1156
00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:07.660
<v Speaker 4>He would never join scientology,</v>

1157
00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:12.440
<v Speaker 4>but I wonder if maybe I'm scientology put themselves there on purpose or,</v>

1158
00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:15.080
<v Speaker 4>or maybe it was just you happened to be there.</v>

1159
00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:15.440
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1160
00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:16.370
<v Speaker 4>they do a,</v>

1161
00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:20.010
<v Speaker 4>they do kind of prey on the abused.</v>

1162
00:39:20.011 --> 00:39:20.844
<v Speaker 4>The addicted.</v>

1163
00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:23.343
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1164
00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:25.100
<v Speaker 4>The vulnerable people vulnerable.</v>

1165
00:39:25.101 --> 00:39:25.221
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1166
00:39:25.221 --> 00:39:26.120
<v Speaker 4>That's a better way to.</v>

1167
00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:26.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1168
00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:29.270
<v Speaker 4>that's a better word I'm looking for and you know,</v>

1169
00:39:29.271 --> 00:39:29.480
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1170
00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:30.313
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1171
00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:35.420
<v Speaker 4>it's scary because in 2005 or six,</v>

1172
00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:37.930
<v Speaker 4>they were actually one of the will self.</v>

1173
00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:39.560
<v Speaker 4>They claimed it themselves,</v>

1174
00:39:39.561 --> 00:39:43.700
<v Speaker 4>but they were one of the fastest growing religions in the world.</v>

1175
00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:44.101
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1176
00:39:44.101 --> 00:39:47.060
<v Speaker 4>I think they were publishing and oh man,</v>

1177
00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:48.830
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how many different languages,</v>

1178
00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:51.110
<v Speaker 4>which is scary.</v>

1179
00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:52.723
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1180
00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:53.490
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:53.750
<v Speaker 4>who?</v>

1183
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:55.430
<v Speaker 4>The Mormons are passing them.</v>

1184
00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:57.120
<v Speaker 4>Not that I'm really a fan of more medicine,</v>

1185
00:39:57.121 --> 00:39:58.430
<v Speaker 4>but it's definitely better than.</v>

1186
00:39:59.020 --> 00:39:59.853
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1187
00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:00.330
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1188
00:40:00.330 --> 00:40:01.163
<v Speaker 4>At least.</v>

1189
00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:03.050
<v Speaker 4>Or an old drug addicted.</v>

1190
00:40:03.051 --> 00:40:05.030
<v Speaker 4>They dress well and don't smell.</v>

1191
00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:08.970
<v Speaker 4>So that's what wasn't good for wives,</v>

1192
00:40:08.971 --> 00:40:09.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1193
00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:10.000
<v Speaker 4>I'm just,</v>

1194
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:10.880
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing wrong with that.</v>

1195
00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:13.530
<v Speaker 4>I would not lie for us.</v>

1196
00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:14.403
<v Speaker 4>Way Too much.</v>

1197
00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:15.583
<v Speaker 4>One's enough.</v>

1198
00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:16.663
<v Speaker 4>One's enough.</v>

1199
00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:17.883
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

1200
00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:19.220
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

1201
00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:20.053
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1202
00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:20.800
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1209
00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:31.510
<v Speaker 4>Maybe we will just cut it here and we'll come back later and above.</v>

1210
00:40:35.070 --> 00:40:35.903
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>
