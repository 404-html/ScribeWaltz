00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.281
You know,

2
00:00:07.281 --> 00:00:11.720
I've kind of wondered about this gender flexibility issue as a form of delayed

3
00:00:11.721 --> 00:00:12.770
fantasy play.

4
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.090
You get Friday and on the go ahead because it looks to me like that is,

5
00:00:17.091 --> 00:00:17.331
you know,

6
00:00:17.331 --> 00:00:19.220
when kids are little and three and four,

7
00:00:19.221 --> 00:00:20.210
say three to seven,

8
00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.550
they do a tremendous amount of identity play.

9
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.940
You know,

10
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.200
they pretend they're animals,

11
00:00:24.201 --> 00:00:26.450
they pretend they're their parents,

12
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.110
they,

13
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:27.500
they,

14
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.430
they pretend they're girls.

15
00:00:28.431 --> 00:00:29.090
If they're boys,

16
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:29.901
they pretend they're boys.

17
00:00:29.901 --> 00:00:30.561
If they're girls,

18
00:00:30.561 --> 00:00:33.170
like they really do a tremendous amount of identity play.

19
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.110
And one of the things that's been really puzzling me is,

20
00:00:36.111 --> 00:00:37.790
well what happens if that isn't,

21
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.140
um,

22
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.750
if they never have an opportunity for that because they're not engaging in

23
00:00:41.751 --> 00:00:42.584
fantasy play,

24
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.600
maybe it's just delayed til adulthood.

25
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.770
That's interesting.

26
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:46.960
So because played,

27
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.930
it's almost impossible to overstate the importance of that rough and tumble play

28
00:00:50.931 --> 00:00:55.130
and then the fantasy play that enables you to adopt different identities and

29
00:00:55.131 --> 00:00:58.790
then then negotiated games that you talked about that enabled people to handle

30
00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.630
both,

31
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:00.351
both victory,

32
00:01:00.351 --> 00:01:02.180
but even more importantly loss.

33
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.190
So that's possible.

34
00:01:04.191 --> 00:01:04.721
That could well be.

35
00:01:04.721 --> 00:01:05.241
I have know that.

36
00:01:05.241 --> 00:01:06.320
I have no opinion on.
