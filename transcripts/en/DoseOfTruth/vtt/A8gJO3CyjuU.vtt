1
00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:07.480
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say they couldn't do it.</v>

2
00:00:07.481 --> 00:00:08.710
<v Speaker 1>I said it was a bad idea.</v>

3
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.903
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:11.830
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

5
00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:12.663
<v Speaker 1>so you don't have,</v>

6
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.400
<v Speaker 1>well I think,</v>

7
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.190
<v Speaker 1>I think that Dave,</v>

8
00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:16.120
<v Speaker 1>I really do believe,</v>

9
00:00:16.121 --> 00:00:17.080
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sad about this,</v>

10
00:00:17.081 --> 00:00:19.850
<v Speaker 1>I do believe that they've bitten off more than they can chew and then it's going</v>

11
00:00:19.851 --> 00:00:20.530
<v Speaker 1>to be,</v>

12
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:20.771
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

13
00:00:20.771 --> 00:00:21.070
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

14
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.050
<v Speaker 1>it's one small,</v>

15
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:24.551
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

16
00:00:24.551 --> 00:00:29.080
<v Speaker 1>it's a warning side with regards to these media conglomerates that are</v>

17
00:00:29.081 --> 00:00:33.730
<v Speaker 1>attempting to produce large scale public discourse because now they've taken on,</v>

18
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.430
<v Speaker 1>they've taken the role of sensor onto themselves and they'll find it.</v>

19
00:00:36.431 --> 00:00:39.760
<v Speaker 1>That's a never ending role that produces endless trouble.</v>

20
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.520
<v Speaker 1>They've got themselves into endless trouble as far as I'm concerned.</v>

21
00:00:42.521 --> 00:00:45.760
<v Speaker 1>And for as it from a perspective of a clinical psychologist,</v>

22
00:00:45.761 --> 00:00:49.720
<v Speaker 1>I would also say the worst thing you can do to someone who's paranoid,</v>

23
00:00:49.721 --> 00:00:53.800
<v Speaker 1>the most ill advice thing you can do to someone who's paranoid is persecute</v>

24
00:00:53.801 --> 00:00:54.530
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

25
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.363
<v Speaker 1>So now that,</v>

26
00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean Alex Jones is always talking about if the little I know about him,</v>

27
00:00:58.721 --> 00:01:02.140
<v Speaker 1>he's always talking about are conspiracies of one form or another.</v>

28
00:01:02.141 --> 00:01:07.030
<v Speaker 1>And now what has all the appearance of a conspiracy between four or five very</v>

29
00:01:07.031 --> 00:01:09.520
<v Speaker 1>large media conglomerates is aimed squarely at him.</v>

30
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.210
<v Speaker 1>So all the people who are watching him who are conspiracy minded and somewhat</v>

31
00:01:13.211 --> 00:01:14.470
<v Speaker 1>paranoid are going to think,</v>

32
00:01:14.471 --> 00:01:14.800
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

33
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.950
<v Speaker 1>Jones must be onto something because otherwise these big conglomerates wouldn't</v>

34
00:01:17.951 --> 00:01:19.180
<v Speaker 1>have clamped down on him.</v>

35
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.381
<v Speaker 1>That's a very,</v>

36
00:01:20.381 --> 00:01:21.220
<v Speaker 1>very bad idea.</v>

37
00:01:21.221 --> 00:01:22.720
<v Speaker 1>And millions of people watch him.</v>

38
00:01:22.721 --> 00:01:23.390
<v Speaker 1>So these holes,</v>

39
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.930
<v Speaker 2>well thought,</v>

40
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.050
<v Speaker 2>these are people who thought that Podesta had an unheard sex ring in a pizza</v>

41
00:01:27.051 --> 00:01:27.411
<v Speaker 2>parlor.</v>

42
00:01:27.411 --> 00:01:29.900
<v Speaker 2>So I don't really think that this is necessarily the straw that broke the</v>

43
00:01:29.901 --> 00:01:30.740
<v Speaker 2>camel's back.</v>

44
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.610
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

45
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:32.443
<v Speaker 2>it sounds to me,</v>

46
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.740
<v Speaker 2>so I want to make sure that clarify.</v>

47
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.170
<v Speaker 2>Are you not amongst the people who believe that,</v>

48
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

49
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.120
<v Speaker 2>these big platforms like youtube,</v>

50
00:01:38.121 --> 00:01:40.070
<v Speaker 2>Facebook should be treated like public utilities?</v>

51
00:01:40.071 --> 00:01:43.910
<v Speaker 2>Because there are a lot of right wingers who do believe that like phone,</v>

52
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:44.121
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

53
00:01:44.121 --> 00:01:47.150
<v Speaker 1>I think they should be treated as public utilities because otherwise they can't</v>

54
00:01:47.151 --> 00:01:51.290
<v Speaker 1>exist because there's no possible way that these corporations can handle</v>

55
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.690
<v Speaker 1>monitoring that they're content.</v>

56
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:54.920
<v Speaker 1>There's too much content.</v>

57
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.640
<v Speaker 1>So they'll run,</v>

58
00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.910
<v Speaker 1>they'll run out of manpower to make the decisions.</v>

59
00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.841
<v Speaker 1>I mean now what,</v>

60
00:01:59.841 --> 00:02:00.111
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

61
00:02:00.111 --> 00:02:01.760
<v Speaker 1>so Alex Jones is now being banned.</v>

62
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.790
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about people who've interviewed Alex Jones,</v>

63
00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:05.720
<v Speaker 1>should they be banned?</v>

64
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.760
<v Speaker 1>That would include Joe Rogan for example.</v>

65
00:02:07.761 --> 00:02:09.680
<v Speaker 1>Cause he interviewed Alex Jones.</v>

66
00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:10.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

67
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.360
<v Speaker 1>So it should be banned him.</v>

68
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.320
<v Speaker 1>Well and if not,</v>

69
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.880
<v Speaker 1>why not?</v>

70
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.470
<v Speaker 2>So you think that Facebook,</v>

71
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.131
<v Speaker 2>youtube,</v>

72
00:02:15.131 --> 00:02:15.431
<v Speaker 2>Google,</v>

73
00:02:15.431 --> 00:02:16.270
<v Speaker 2>these companies that,</v>

74
00:02:16.271 --> 00:02:16.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

75
00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.830
<v Speaker 2>basically startup in garages,</v>

76
00:02:17.831 --> 00:02:21.340
<v Speaker 2>these tech startups and invest millions of dollars and they grow to become</v>

77
00:02:21.341 --> 00:02:26.341
<v Speaker 2>successful and then you support the government stepping in and an authoritarian</v>

78
00:02:26.831 --> 00:02:30.640
<v Speaker 2>fashion and telling them who they have to allow on their platforms.</v>

79
00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.470
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say the government should step in.</v>

80
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.640
<v Speaker 1>I said that they made a mistake by deciding to act as sensors and that they'll</v>

81
00:02:36.641 --> 00:02:37.181
<v Speaker 1>pay for it.</v>

82
00:02:37.181 --> 00:02:39.940
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say anything about anybody stepping in and changing it.</v>

83
00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.230
<v Speaker 1>I said it was a mistake.</v>

84
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.360
<v Speaker 2>Well if they're to be treated like public utilities and that would be the</v>

85
00:02:43.361 --> 00:02:45.160
<v Speaker 2>government stepping in cause right now they're not.</v>

86
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.900
<v Speaker 1>Well if they were to be treated as public utilities,</v>

87
00:02:48.901 --> 00:02:51.300
<v Speaker 1>that would be a transformation in the way they were regulated.</v>

88
00:02:51.301 --> 00:02:54.180
<v Speaker 1>So that really doesn't have anything to do specifically with the Alex Jones</v>

89
00:02:54.181 --> 00:02:55.014
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>

90
00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.140
<v Speaker 1>Don't support it.</v>

91
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.011
<v Speaker 1>You would support it.</v>

92
00:02:57.011 --> 00:02:57.510
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

93
00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.120
<v Speaker 1>And that's the question because I'm the one having to come up with all the</v>

94
00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:02.290
<v Speaker 1>complex answers.</v>

95
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:03.190
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

96
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.810
<v Speaker 1>so how would you propose that these complex corporations decide which content is</v>

97
00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:08.644
<v Speaker 1>acceptable?</v>

98
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.990
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

99
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.160
<v Speaker 2>How would you propose specs?</v>

100
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there does need to be a proposal.</v>

101
00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think this is where actually I would be on your side.</v>

102
00:03:16.201 --> 00:03:19.560
<v Speaker 2>Let the free market decide and the free market is youtube and Facebook and if</v>

103
00:03:19.561 --> 00:03:21.330
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to host content,</v>

104
00:03:21.331 --> 00:03:23.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they should be forced to host content.</v>

105
00:03:23.911 --> 00:03:27.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they should be compelled to host content.</v>

106
00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.460
<v Speaker 1>Well obviously they shouldn't be that.</v>

107
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:30.570
<v Speaker 1>That's not the issue.</v>

108
00:03:30.571 --> 00:03:34.050
<v Speaker 1>The issue is how are they going to go about making the decisions and how are we</v>

109
00:03:34.051 --> 00:03:36.390
<v Speaker 1>going to be sure that that won't go dreadfully wrong?</v>

110
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.811
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

111
00:03:36.811 --> 00:03:39.600
<v Speaker 1>obviously it's the case that censorship can go wrong.</v>

112
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.700
<v Speaker 1>You certainly see that in places like China.</v>

113
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.710
<v Speaker 1>Once you start with censorship,</v>

114
00:03:43.711 --> 00:03:44.520
<v Speaker 1>how do you know?</v>

115
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.870
<v Speaker 1>How do you have any idea?</v>

116
00:03:45.871 --> 00:03:49.740
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to put proper boundaries around it and decide who's acceptable</v>

117
00:03:49.741 --> 00:03:49.921
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

118
00:03:49.921 --> 00:03:53.040
<v Speaker 1>they're going to let your listeners decide that or you're going to decide it and</v>

119
00:03:53.041 --> 00:03:55.770
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to find out that you've taken on a huge weight of decision</v>

120
00:03:55.771 --> 00:03:57.030
<v Speaker 1>making that you can't handle.</v>

121
00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.261
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe I'm wrong.</v>

122
00:03:58.261 --> 00:03:59.160
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that won't happen,</v>

123
00:03:59.161 --> 00:03:59.700
<v Speaker 1>but it's certain.</v>

124
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.780
<v Speaker 1>Certainly I would be very low to decide what needs to be censored because the</v>

125
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.720
<v Speaker 1>number of decisions I'd have to make with multiplied beyond end.</v>

126
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.650
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

127
00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying what any specific individual does.</v>

128
00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.741
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying,</v>

129
00:04:10.741 --> 00:04:11.910
<v Speaker 2>let the free market decide.</v>

130
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.540
<v Speaker 2>If people don't want a Alex Jones on Youtube,</v>

131
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.580
<v Speaker 2>then youtube doesn't have to provide it.</v>

132
00:04:17.581 --> 00:04:18.750
<v Speaker 2>If people watching youtube,</v>

133
00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.990
<v Speaker 1>I already agreed that youtube doesn't have to provide it.</v>

134
00:04:20.991 --> 00:04:23.180
<v Speaker 1>I said it was a mistake to engage in censorship.</v>

135
00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.900
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

136
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.990
<v Speaker 1>Just because people are allowed to do something doesn't mean it isn't a mistake</v>

137
00:04:26.991 --> 00:04:27.824
<v Speaker 1>upon occasion.</v>

138
00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.390
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not asking for government regulation and the idea that transforming these</v>

139
00:04:32.391 --> 00:04:35.570
<v Speaker 1>corporations into something approximating utilities would be a form of</v>

140
00:04:35.571 --> 00:04:37.540
<v Speaker 1>regulation is really an and,</v>

141
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.880
<v Speaker 1>and what would you say it's an ill formed way of posing the question.</v>

142
00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.530
<v Speaker 1>It's a matter of classification.</v>

143
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.170
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that Alex Jones should be able to use a phone?</v>

144
00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.910
<v Speaker 2>I do think Alex Jones to be able to use a phone as long as he pays for it,</v>

145
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.150
<v Speaker 2>as long as the phone company wants to offer him their services.</v>

146
00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.731
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

147
00:04:52.731 --> 00:04:56.390
<v Speaker 1>So the phone company offers everyone equal access to the services regardless of</v>

148
00:04:56.391 --> 00:04:57.224
<v Speaker 1>content.</v>

149
00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.930
<v Speaker 1>And I presume you to object if the phone service started to decide that</v>

150
00:04:59.931 --> 00:05:01.940
<v Speaker 1>conversation shouldn't be allowed to occur.</v>

151
00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:03.390
<v Speaker 1>And so it it,</v>

152
00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.710
<v Speaker 1>you can make a reasonable argument that these large scale media distribution</v>

153
00:05:06.711 --> 00:05:07.940
<v Speaker 1>companies played the same role.</v>

154
00:05:07.941 --> 00:05:09.140
<v Speaker 1>But on a larger scale.</v>

155
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.190
<v Speaker 1>It's not necessarily the case that it's an argument without flaw,</v>

156
00:05:13.191 --> 00:05:14.570
<v Speaker 1>but it's a reasonable argument.</v>

157
00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.910
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think that there's any real alternative.</v>

158
00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't see how companies like Facebook and Youtube can possibly police their</v>

159
00:05:21.981 --> 00:05:25.700
<v Speaker 1>content without producing far more trouble then they'll save.</v>

160
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.800
<v Speaker 1>That's the issue.</v>

161
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.011
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

162
00:05:27.011 --> 00:05:28.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm not so much just concerned about the,</v>

163
00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:29.111
<v Speaker 2>in the content.</v>

164
00:05:29.111 --> 00:05:31.090
<v Speaker 2>What I'm concerned with is let's say we did it.</v>

165
00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.340
<v Speaker 2>So the public utilities sort of option,</v>

166
00:05:33.341 --> 00:05:33.770
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

167
00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:34.603
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

168
00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.720
<v Speaker 2>what I'm concerned with is the free market will be able to provide alternatives.</v>

169
00:05:37.721 --> 00:05:37.961
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

170
00:05:37.961 --> 00:05:40.060
<v Speaker 2>Alex Jones can go there if we believe,</v>

171
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.700
<v Speaker 2>if we're consistent and we believe in freedom of speech and the freedom of</v>

172
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.290
<v Speaker 2>market as it applies thereof,</v>

173
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.360
<v Speaker 2>we should be free to accept,</v>

174
00:05:46.361 --> 00:05:49.560
<v Speaker 2>we should believe follow this down the logical trail that a,</v>

175
00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.290
<v Speaker 2>there'll be an alternative platform for Alex or no?</v>

176
00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.331
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

177
00:05:53.331 --> 00:05:54.290
<v Speaker 1>there probably will be.</v>

178
00:05:54.291 --> 00:05:57.680
<v Speaker 1>And that's also why I think it was a mistake for these companies engage in the</v>

179
00:05:57.681 --> 00:06:00.770
<v Speaker 1>censorship because I think that they're signing their own death warrant by doing</v>

180
00:06:00.771 --> 00:06:01.490
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

181
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.320
<v Speaker 1>It will probably take 10 years to unfold.</v>

182
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:04.820
<v Speaker 1>But it's a big mistake.</v>

183
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.980
<v Speaker 1>And so that is what will happen is because people will stop trusting youtube and</v>

184
00:06:09.981 --> 00:06:10.491
<v Speaker 1>Facebook.</v>

185
00:06:10.491 --> 00:06:13.970
<v Speaker 1>And so forth to provide uncensored access to content.</v>

186
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:15.290
<v Speaker 1>And as a consequence,</v>

187
00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:16.124
<v Speaker 1>other forms of,</v>

188
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.290
<v Speaker 1>of information distribution will emerge.</v>

189
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.040
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

190
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.770
<v Speaker 1>that's why I thought it was bad decision from corporate perspective.</v>

191
00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:23.510
<v Speaker 1>They had every right to make it,</v>

192
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:24.980
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's bad decision,</v>

193
00:06:24.981 --> 00:06:25.110
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

194
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.621
<v Speaker 2>If I were to,</v>

195
00:06:25.621 --> 00:06:27.030
<v Speaker 2>if I were to walk into your house,</v>

196
00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:27.780
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

197
00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.380
<v Speaker 2>if I were to walk into your house right now and just and harass you and call you</v>

198
00:06:31.381 --> 00:06:35.760
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of names and get right up in your face and not leave after you've</v>

199
00:06:35.761 --> 00:06:39.360
<v Speaker 2>asked me to leave and continue harassing you,</v>

200
00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:40.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

201
00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:40.883
<v Speaker 2>without any,</v>

202
00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:41.761
<v Speaker 2>without any,</v>

203
00:06:41.761 --> 00:06:42.061
<v Speaker 2>any,</v>

204
00:06:42.061 --> 00:06:43.560
<v Speaker 2>a refuge for you,</v>

205
00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.220
<v Speaker 2>would you think that that is a crime for me to do that?</v>

206
00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why you're asking the question.</v>

207
00:06:50.011 --> 00:06:50.830
<v Speaker 2>So let me tell you why that's,</v>

208
00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:52.140
<v Speaker 2>so now again,</v>

209
00:06:52.141 --> 00:06:54.200
<v Speaker 2>this is why we were talking about the constitution in guns.</v>

210
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.850
<v Speaker 2>Now I have fully automatic air fifteens and things change,</v>

211
00:06:56.851 --> 00:06:57.001
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

212
00:06:57.001 --> 00:06:57.571
<v Speaker 2>Times change,</v>

213
00:06:57.571 --> 00:06:58.530
<v Speaker 2>we need to adapt.</v>

214
00:06:58.531 --> 00:07:00.210
<v Speaker 2>And we've both agreed on that to some extent.</v>

215
00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:01.980
<v Speaker 2>Now Online,</v>

216
00:07:01.981 --> 00:07:03.210
<v Speaker 2>people like Alex Jones,</v>

217
00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:08.240
<v Speaker 2>they have the ability to invade your house digitally continually and harass and</v>

218
00:07:09.211 --> 00:07:11.160
<v Speaker 2>berate shut off.</v>

219
00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:12.390
<v Speaker 2>Not necessarily.</v>

220
00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:12.901
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>

221
00:07:12.901 --> 00:07:13.291
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>

222
00:07:13.291 --> 00:07:14.250
<v Speaker 2>you can't shut off everything.</v>

223
00:07:14.251 --> 00:07:15.180
<v Speaker 2>You can't block people.</v>

224
00:07:15.181 --> 00:07:16.950
<v Speaker 2>He can't mute people on every platform.</v>

225
00:07:16.951 --> 00:07:19.140
<v Speaker 2>Then they can have your email on youtube.</v>

226
00:07:19.141 --> 00:07:19.291
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

227
00:07:19.291 --> 00:07:19.741
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

228
00:07:19.741 --> 00:07:24.690
<v Speaker 2>it shows up in your suggested for the point is as fast as you can just shut the</v>

229
00:07:24.691 --> 00:07:25.860
<v Speaker 2>whole thing off if you want.</v>

230
00:07:25.861 --> 00:07:26.880
<v Speaker 2>So it's a silly argument.</v>

231
00:07:26.881 --> 00:07:28.470
<v Speaker 2>It's not like someone invading your house.</v>

232
00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.530
<v Speaker 2>So because you can shut it off at any time.</v>

233
00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:32.380
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

234
00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:33.210
<v Speaker 2>It's just not,</v>

235
00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:34.350
<v Speaker 2>that's just not going anywhere.</v>

236
00:07:34.351 --> 00:07:34.980
<v Speaker 2>That argument.</v>

237
00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:35.101
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

238
00:07:35.101 --> 00:07:38.370
<v Speaker 2>what if someone has a computer in their house then if they have a computer now</v>

239
00:07:38.371 --> 00:07:38.730
<v Speaker 2>son,</v>

240
00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:40.070
<v Speaker 2>it means that someone can invade their,</v>

241
00:07:40.071 --> 00:07:41.160
<v Speaker 2>their house that way digitally.</v>

242
00:07:41.161 --> 00:07:41.580
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

243
00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.860
<v Speaker 2>there's no way to find a space away from me.</v>

244
00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.230
<v Speaker 2>Particularly people like Alex Jones,</v>

245
00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.200
<v Speaker 2>most egregious offenders,</v>

246
00:07:46.201 --> 00:07:46.381
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

247
00:07:46.381 --> 00:07:50.700
<v Speaker 2>Who spread conspiracies and effectively like lead to doxing of people.</v>

248
00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:51.480
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

249
00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.313
<v Speaker 2>I mean</v>

250
00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:53.891
<v Speaker 1>the thing is too,</v>

251
00:07:53.891 --> 00:07:54.730
<v Speaker 1>it's again,</v>

252
00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.500
<v Speaker 1>again the,</v>

253
00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:56.820
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

254
00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:58.480
<v Speaker 1>the question is more fundamental.</v>

255
00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:03.780
<v Speaker 1>Let's assume that it's a bad idea for poorly supported conspiracy theories to be</v>

256
00:08:04.811 --> 00:08:06.310
<v Speaker 1>formulated and distributed.</v>

257
00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:07.510
<v Speaker 1>Let's assume that,</v>

258
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:08.590
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

259
00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:08.981
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

260
00:08:08.981 --> 00:08:09.191
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

261
00:08:09.191 --> 00:08:10.600
<v Speaker 1>we don't need to put it in air quotes.</v>

262
00:08:10.601 --> 00:08:11.920
<v Speaker 1>We could probably both assume it.</v>

263
00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.400
<v Speaker 1>The question is what should you do with people who are doing that?</v>

264
00:08:15.401 --> 00:08:17.200
<v Speaker 1>And that one answer is well,</v>

265
00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:19.990
<v Speaker 1>do what you can to silence them and drive them underground.</v>

266
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.680
<v Speaker 1>The other is let them talk and let people make up their own minds.</v>

267
00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:25.240
<v Speaker 1>And my sense is,</v>

268
00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:31.020
<v Speaker 1>is that people are wise enough to listen to people of that sort and decide that</v>

269
00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:32.800
<v Speaker 1>that's too extreme.</v>

270
00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:33.671
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

271
00:08:33.671 --> 00:08:34.331
<v Speaker 1>not every one,</v>

272
00:08:34.331 --> 00:08:35.164
<v Speaker 1>because</v>

273
00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:40.300
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy theorists can find followers among people who are disagreeable and</v>

274
00:08:40.301 --> 00:08:41.170
<v Speaker 1>somewhat paranoid,</v>

275
00:08:41.171 --> 00:08:42.730
<v Speaker 1>but it's best for everyone,</v>

276
00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:44.950
<v Speaker 1>including the conspiracy theorists themselves,</v>

277
00:08:44.951 --> 00:08:48.010
<v Speaker 1>that those things are aired in public discussion because it helps keep people</v>

278
00:08:48.011 --> 00:08:48.844
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

279
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:49.091
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

280
00:08:49.091 --> 00:08:51.160
<v Speaker 1>like I've known people who are a little bit on this.</v>

281
00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:51.810
<v Speaker 1>Disagree.</v>

282
00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:52.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

283
00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.010
<v Speaker 1>but that's because you don't know what you're talking about.</v>

284
00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:54.990
<v Speaker 1>I have no incorrect.</v>

285
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:55.171
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

286
00:08:55.171 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 1>there are more Americans</v>

287
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.710
<v Speaker 2>who believe in angels then in climate change,</v>

288
00:08:59.070 --> 00:08:59.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

289
00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:00.740
<v Speaker 2>the top shows that are Kardashians.</v>

290
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:01.680
<v Speaker 2>Look at what's on television.</v>

291
00:09:01.681 --> 00:09:03.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that the American public,</v>

292
00:09:03.361 --> 00:09:05.700
<v Speaker 2>that anyone should be granted the same.</v>

293
00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:06.611
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

294
00:09:06.611 --> 00:09:07.710
<v Speaker 2>And as you see that they should be,</v>

295
00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:08.200
<v Speaker 2>there should be,</v>

296
00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.050
<v Speaker 2>why should treat them wise enough?</v>

297
00:09:10.051 --> 00:09:13.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying I don't think they're wise enough and that's why the compared to the</v>

298
00:09:13.471 --> 00:09:14.340
<v Speaker 2>alternatives.</v>

299
00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:15.180
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

300
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:15.361
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

301
00:09:15.361 --> 00:09:18.840
<v Speaker 2>your system in the United States was never set up under the presumption that the</v>

302
00:09:18.841 --> 00:09:19.920
<v Speaker 2>people were wise.</v>

303
00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.440
<v Speaker 2>It was set up under the presumption that the people,</v>

304
00:09:22.441 --> 00:09:23.520
<v Speaker 2>regardless of their wisdom,</v>

305
00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:25.110
<v Speaker 2>had the right to self determination.</v>

306
00:09:25.111 --> 00:09:29.010
<v Speaker 2>And even more importantly that although the people themselves might not always</v>

307
00:09:29.011 --> 00:09:29.521
<v Speaker 2>be wise,</v>

308
00:09:29.521 --> 00:09:33.120
<v Speaker 2>there isn't a better source of authority than the people themselves.</v>

309
00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:36.630
<v Speaker 2>So that no matter how corrupt and foolish the people happen to be,</v>

310
00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:40.320
<v Speaker 2>whatever systems you put in place to supplant them will be worse.</v>

311
00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:42.083
<v Speaker 2>And so I think,</v>

312
00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:43.620
<v Speaker 2>and you might not believe that,</v>

313
00:09:43.621 --> 00:09:43.841
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>

314
00:09:43.841 --> 00:09:44.581
<v Speaker 2>and that's fine,</v>

315
00:09:44.581 --> 00:09:46.840
<v Speaker 2>but that is the founding principal of the dark blue.</v>

316
00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:47.911
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe it.</v>

317
00:09:47.911 --> 00:09:48.001
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

318
00:09:48.001 --> 00:09:48.601
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>

319
00:09:48.601 --> 00:09:49.434
<v Speaker 2>You don't believe it.</v>

320
00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:50.160
<v Speaker 2>Don't believe that.</v>

321
00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that Alex Jones and anyone with a Facebook page is,</v>

322
00:09:53.611 --> 00:09:54.360
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

323
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.800
<v Speaker 2>as qualified and a,</v>

324
00:09:55.801 --> 00:09:59.250
<v Speaker 2>and as I say for the American public as Walter Cronkite or people in the Senate</v>

325
00:09:59.251 --> 00:10:02.400
<v Speaker 2>and house who are qualified to make these determinations.</v>

326
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:02.881
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

327
00:10:02.881 --> 00:10:03.900
<v Speaker 2>that's just a disagreement,</v>

328
00:10:03.901 --> 00:10:04.800
<v Speaker 2>but I'll let people,</v>

329
00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:05.251
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

330
00:10:05.251 --> 00:10:07.080
<v Speaker 2>let's switch just a diff disagreement.</v>

331
00:10:07.081 --> 00:10:10.020
<v Speaker 2>It's actually a disagreement about the fundamental structure of the entire</v>

332
00:10:10.021 --> 00:10:13.950
<v Speaker 2>political system because you'd think that it's possible to produce banks of</v>

333
00:10:13.951 --> 00:10:17.700
<v Speaker 2>experts of one sort or another who can supplant the fundamental will of the</v>

334
00:10:17.701 --> 00:10:18.121
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

335
00:10:18.121 --> 00:10:19.080
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think,</v>

336
00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:20.850
<v Speaker 2>I think that that's a very bad idea.</v>

337
00:10:20.851 --> 00:10:23.220
<v Speaker 2>And I think that history shows that that's a bad idea,</v>

338
00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:26.550
<v Speaker 2>at least with democracy itself tends to be self correcting.</v>

339
00:10:26.551 --> 00:10:28.230
<v Speaker 2>So if people make egregious errors,</v>

340
00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:30.300
<v Speaker 2>they correct them in the next election.</v>

341
00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:30.870
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

342
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:31.703
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

343
00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:32.491
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

344
00:10:32.491 --> 00:10:33.031
<v Speaker 2>I want to,</v>

345
00:10:33.031 --> 00:10:33.880
<v Speaker 2>I want to give you a quote.</v>

346
00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:34.411
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>

347
00:10:34.411 --> 00:10:39.090
<v Speaker 2>that is self authoring.com if you want to take your quiz and the book 12 rule</v>

348
00:10:39.091 --> 00:10:41.190
<v Speaker 2>for life is available at places.</v>

349
00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:42.090
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

350
00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:43.010
<v Speaker 2>so let me,</v>

351
00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:43.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

352
00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:44.693
<v Speaker 2>final question.</v>

353
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:45.623
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever,</v>

354
00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:48.780
<v Speaker 2>does it ever concern you that you might be on the wrong side of history?</v>

355
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:52.700
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

356
00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:56.030
<v Speaker 2>What mostly concerns me is whether I make a mistake when I'm talking.</v>

357
00:10:56.031 --> 00:10:57.050
<v Speaker 2>And so I,</v>

358
00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:57.570
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

359
00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:00.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm not thinking about the wrong side of history precisely.</v>

360
00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:01.843
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

361
00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:05.810
<v Speaker 2>I might be making mistakes that concerns me all the time.</v>

362
00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:06.851
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

363
00:11:06.851 --> 00:11:07.160
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

364
00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:07.970
<v Speaker 2>I thought most,</v>

365
00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:11.420
<v Speaker 2>I thought the things that I say through very carefully and you know,</v>

366
00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:14.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm perfectly willing to live or die by them,</v>

367
00:11:14.151 --> 00:11:14.810
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>

368
00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:15.450
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

369
00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:16.283
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

370
00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:17.451
<v Speaker 2>well I asked you that,</v>

371
00:11:17.451 --> 00:11:17.751
<v Speaker 2>cause you know,</v>

372
00:11:17.751 --> 00:11:19.430
<v Speaker 2>we've gone through a litany of,</v>

373
00:11:19.431 --> 00:11:19.850
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

374
00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:20.210
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

375
00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:20.391
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

376
00:11:20.391 --> 00:11:24.260
<v Speaker 2>using people's preferred pronouns of the idea of compassion,</v>

377
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:25.183
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

378
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:26.360
<v Speaker 2>neither of which do you support.</v>

379
00:11:26.361 --> 00:11:29.270
<v Speaker 2>And then we've gone through things like Alex Jones and extremists and social</v>

380
00:11:29.271 --> 00:11:31.830
<v Speaker 2>media and these are ideas that you do.</v>

381
00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:36.080
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if you constantly finding yourself defending just bad,</v>

382
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:37.160
<v Speaker 2>like bad people.</v>

383
00:11:37.161 --> 00:11:38.270
<v Speaker 2>And even if you're not one,</v>

384
00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:38.631
<v Speaker 2>if you have,</v>

385
00:11:38.631 --> 00:11:43.370
<v Speaker 2>mostly what I find myself doing is I'm being supported by a very large number of</v>

386
00:11:43.371 --> 00:11:44.930
<v Speaker 2>people and being,</v>

387
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:45.500
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

388
00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:46.161
<v Speaker 2>what would you call,</v>

389
00:11:46.161 --> 00:11:49.010
<v Speaker 2>put on the spot in various uncomfortable ways by a tiny,</v>

390
00:11:49.011 --> 00:11:52.190
<v Speaker 2>noisy minority of let radical collectivists.</v>

391
00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:55.900
<v Speaker 2>So that's mostly I feel are more mostly what I experienced.</v>

392
00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:56.941
<v Speaker 2>So isn't it,</v>

393
00:11:56.941 --> 00:11:58.120
<v Speaker 2>what side of history,</v>

394
00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.150
<v Speaker 2>isn't it your buddies who says sacks don't care about your feelings?</v>
