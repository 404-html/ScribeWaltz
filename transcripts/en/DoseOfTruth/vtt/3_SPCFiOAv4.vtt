<v Speaker 1>Anonymous says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I deal with the fact that I'm a</v>

2
00:00:09.441 --> 00:00:12.650
<v Speaker 1>pedophile and should I tell my family</v>
<v Speaker 1>and friends it?</v>

3
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't answer the second part of that.</v>

4
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.430
<v Speaker 1>Should I tell my family and friends</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I don't know your family and</v>

5
00:00:19.431 --> 00:00:22.490
<v Speaker 1>friends and I don't know how you would</v>
<v Speaker 1>go about telling them.</v>

6
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.300
<v Speaker 1>So I can't make a piece of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't make any advice about that or I</v>

7
00:00:26.301 --> 00:00:28.700
<v Speaker 1>can't offer you any advice about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

8
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.140
<v Speaker 1>I would say that if you have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity,</v>

9
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.450
<v Speaker 1>you should probably go speak to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>counselor or priest or someone that you</v>

10
00:00:35.451 --> 00:00:36.950
<v Speaker 1>trust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

11
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.810
<v Speaker 1>because you're going to have to figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>out how to deal with that and,</v>

12
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.850
<v Speaker 1>but you should also maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's about the best I can do with</v>

13
00:00:43.851 --> 00:00:45.860
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not an expert in the treatment of</v>

14
00:00:45.861 --> 00:00:48.920
<v Speaker 1>pedophilia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I can't offer you any great</v>

15
00:00:48.921 --> 00:00:52.940
<v Speaker 1>clinical wisdom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would say that you need a plan.</v>

16
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.010
<v Speaker 1>You need to plan and you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would include in that plan the</v>

17
00:00:58.011 --> 00:01:02.750
<v Speaker 1>absolutely catastrophic consequences of</v>
<v Speaker 1>not regulating that behavior properly.</v>

18
00:01:02.751 --> 00:01:07.190
<v Speaker 1>And you should really think it through</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that pedophilic impulse,</v>

19
00:01:07.191 --> 00:01:09.410
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could lead you into seven different</v>

20
00:01:09.411 --> 00:01:12.410
<v Speaker 1>sorts of hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You and whoever you happen to tangle up</v>

21
00:01:12.411 --> 00:01:16.280
<v Speaker 1>in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you might want to avoid severed</v>

22
00:01:16.281 --> 00:01:19.040
<v Speaker 1>diff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might want to avoid seven different,</v>

23
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.280
<v Speaker 1>seven different forms of hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in order to do that,</v>

24
00:01:22.281 --> 00:01:25.490
<v Speaker 1>given the proclivity that you described,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to have to have a</v>

25
00:01:25.491 --> 00:01:26.510
<v Speaker 1>plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

26
00:01:26.511 --> 00:01:28.790
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of people have impulses that they</v>

27
00:01:28.791 --> 00:01:30.230
<v Speaker 1>have a hard time controlling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

28
00:01:30.231 --> 00:01:32.690
<v Speaker 1>alcoholics can't drink alcohol and</v>
<v Speaker 1>cocaine.</v>

29
00:01:32.691 --> 00:01:35.930
<v Speaker 1>Addicts can't take cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and most people can't.</v>

30
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.410
<v Speaker 1>What manifest untrammeled sexual</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

31
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.830
<v Speaker 1>And so it certainly within the capacity</v>
<v Speaker 1>of human beings to regulate impulses</v>

32
00:01:46.011 --> 00:01:48.620
<v Speaker 1>that aren't in there or other's best</v>
<v Speaker 1>interests.</v>

33
00:01:48.621 --> 00:01:50.780
<v Speaker 1>So I wouldn't regard it as a hopeless</v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuit,</v>

34
00:01:50.781 --> 00:01:53.840
<v Speaker 1>but it does seem to me that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that you might want to talk to</v>

35
00:01:53.841 --> 00:01:58.841
<v Speaker 1>someone you trust about because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a complicated issue and it's a</v>

36
00:02:00.771 --> 00:02:04.850
<v Speaker 1>proclivity that's likely to lead you in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a direction that would be,</v>

37
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.680
<v Speaker 1>let's call it sub optimal.</v>
