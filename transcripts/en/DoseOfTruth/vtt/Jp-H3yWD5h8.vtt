00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:09.460
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

2
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.280
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a couple of questions from the live chat zooming along here.</v>

3
00:00:13.281 --> 00:00:14.114
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

4
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.433
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.450
<v Speaker 1>how should one deal with recurring self pity and why is it so gripping?</v>

6
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.303
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

7
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.530
<v Speaker 1>it can be gripping for a variety of reasons.</v>

8
00:00:25.531 --> 00:00:28.050
<v Speaker 1>It can be gripping because you are,</v>

9
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.920
<v Speaker 1>let's see,</v>

10
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.260
<v Speaker 1>because you are high in neuroticism.</v>

11
00:00:31.261 --> 00:00:32.340
<v Speaker 1>That's a possibility.</v>

12
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:33.623
<v Speaker 1>And A,</v>

13
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.110
<v Speaker 1>and why is it so gripping?</v>

14
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.251
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

15
00:00:38.251 --> 00:00:39.610
<v Speaker 1>that's another potential reason.</v>

16
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.080
<v Speaker 1>It's hard for me to say.</v>

17
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.243
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

18
00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:43.383
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>

19
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.223
<v Speaker 1>I have a,</v>

20
00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.060
<v Speaker 1>another chapter like that.</v>

21
00:00:46.061 --> 00:00:47.170
<v Speaker 1>What's it called there?</v>

22
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.153
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

23
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.711
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

24
00:00:52.711 --> 00:00:53.011
<v Speaker 1>it again,</v>

25
00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:56.100
<v Speaker 1>it's rural to treat yourself like someone you were responsible for helping.</v>

26
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.431
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

27
00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:57.990
<v Speaker 1>why the hell wouldn't you pity yourself?</v>

28
00:00:57.991 --> 00:00:58.261
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

29
00:00:58.261 --> 00:00:59.094
<v Speaker 1>people are,</v>

30
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.150
<v Speaker 1>life is tragic.</v>

31
00:01:00.151 --> 00:01:01.350
<v Speaker 1>Everything ends in death.</v>

32
00:01:01.351 --> 00:01:03.600
<v Speaker 1>Everything that you have will be taken away from you.</v>

33
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.190
<v Speaker 1>You're weak and breakable and prone to fits of impulsivity and malevolence.</v>

34
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.900
<v Speaker 1>How could you not have self pity?</v>

35
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.381
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

36
00:01:10.381 --> 00:01:11.400
<v Speaker 1>that's really the answer,</v>

37
00:01:11.401 --> 00:01:11.940
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

38
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:12.990
<v Speaker 1>but the next answer is,</v>

39
00:01:12.991 --> 00:01:13.201
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

40
00:01:13.201 --> 00:01:13.351
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

41
00:01:13.351 --> 00:01:14.011
<v Speaker 1>despite that,</v>

42
00:01:14.011 --> 00:01:14.910
<v Speaker 1>it's not good enough.</v>

43
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.960
<v Speaker 1>You have to rise above all that even though you have every reason for it.</v>

44
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.830
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing that's so paradoxical is you have to rise above it even though</v>

45
00:01:22.831 --> 00:01:24.090
<v Speaker 1>you have every reason for it.</v>

46
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.210
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason you have to rise above it is because if you don't,</v>

47
00:01:27.211 --> 00:01:28.440
<v Speaker 1>it makes everything worse.</v>

48
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.470
<v Speaker 1>You and everything else and being itself.</v>

49
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.310
<v Speaker 1>And so it's gripping because well,</v>

50
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:36.330
<v Speaker 1>it does grip you,</v>

51
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.253
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

52
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.230
<v Speaker 1>malevolence and tragedy and vulnerability and,</v>

53
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.190
<v Speaker 1>and mortality.</v>

54
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.150
<v Speaker 1>They're gripping.</v>

55
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.261
<v Speaker 1>And I would say,</v>

56
00:01:43.261 --> 00:01:43.441
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

57
00:01:43.441 --> 00:01:45.900
<v Speaker 1>you have to find something that's even more gripping than that.</v>

58
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.340
<v Speaker 1>And I would say the most,</v>

59
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.780
<v Speaker 1>the thing that's most gripping,</v>

60
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.320
<v Speaker 1>the only thing that's more gripping than that in true and truth,</v>

61
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.970
<v Speaker 1>is to live a good life,</v>

62
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.610
<v Speaker 1>to live the best life you possibly can,</v>

63
00:01:56.611 --> 00:02:00.390
<v Speaker 1>to live a life that's so noble that all of those things are justifiable.</v>

64
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.831
<v Speaker 1>Yuri,</v>

65
00:02:01.831 --> 00:02:03.270
<v Speaker 1>l three 33 he says,</v>

66
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.490
<v Speaker 1>JP thinks he is a monster.</v>

67
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.330
<v Speaker 1>L U.</v>

68
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.520
<v Speaker 1>L I didn't know what l u l means,</v>

69
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.590
<v Speaker 1>but I don't actually think I'm a monster.</v>

70
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.650
<v Speaker 1>There's a difference between thinking you're a monster and knowing you're a</v>

71
00:02:13.651 --> 00:02:14.220
<v Speaker 1>monster.</v>
