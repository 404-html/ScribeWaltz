1
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:13.170
<v Speaker 1>I probably Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt massacre that name says who has a</v>

2
00:00:13.171 --> 00:00:15.750
<v Speaker 1>higher Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really gifted mathematician or a</v>

3
00:00:15.751 --> 00:00:18.960
<v Speaker 1>really gifted painter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to say.</v>

4
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.430
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would say that gifted math,</v>

5
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.430
<v Speaker 1>because if they're both gifted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they both have high Iq,</v>

6
00:00:26.431 --> 00:00:29.550
<v Speaker 1>so you can be certain of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to do anything</v>

7
00:00:29.551 --> 00:00:32.370
<v Speaker 1>that's truly gifted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say above the average,</v>

8
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.420
<v Speaker 1>above the norm without being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without having a very high Iq and in a</v>

9
00:00:37.421 --> 00:00:40.320
<v Speaker 1>creative realm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you hear about these idiot savant</v>

10
00:00:40.321 --> 00:00:43.230
<v Speaker 1>who have like one area of extreme</v>
<v Speaker 1>expertise,</v>

11
00:00:43.231 --> 00:00:47.730
<v Speaker 1>but generally in those cases it's not so</v>
<v Speaker 1>much that they have one area of extreme</v>

12
00:00:47.731 --> 00:00:50.700
<v Speaker 1>expertise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that they have one area of above</v>

13
00:00:50.701 --> 00:00:54.600
<v Speaker 1>average expertise that really contrast</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the rest of their impairments,</v>

14
00:00:54.601 --> 00:00:57.510
<v Speaker 1>but they rarely if ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it into the,</v>

15
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the very short list of true geniuses.</v>

16
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.940
<v Speaker 1>Mathematicians are kind of an odd bunch</v>
<v Speaker 1>though because you,</v>

17
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.840
<v Speaker 1>they peek really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really early.</v>

18
00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:09.900
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're going to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematician and truly gifted,</v>

19
00:01:09.901 --> 00:01:14.901
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to show signs of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're like 17 to 20 something like</v>

20
00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:17.760
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas painters can,</v>

21
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.060
<v Speaker 1>can be creative through their entire</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifespan.</v>

22
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.330
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say probably on average,</v>

23
00:01:24.331 --> 00:01:28.440
<v Speaker 1>I would guess this is a guest that if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you took a hundred really gifted</v>

24
00:01:28.441 --> 00:01:30.720
<v Speaker 1>mathematicians and a hundred really</v>
<v Speaker 1>gifted painters,</v>

25
00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:35.721
<v Speaker 1>that the mathematicians would have far</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher nonverbal Iq,</v>

26
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.400
<v Speaker 1>but the painters might have higher</v>
<v Speaker 1>verbal Iq was.</v>

27
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.690
<v Speaker 1>So that also complicates things seat</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Iq.</v>

28
00:01:42.691 --> 00:01:45.060
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.360
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this factor called the g factor,</v>

30
00:01:48.361 --> 00:01:51.390
<v Speaker 1>which is the central element of</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>

31
00:01:51.391 --> 00:01:56.010
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to be associated with such</v>
<v Speaker 1>things as head size and brain size</v>

32
00:01:56.011 --> 00:02:00.510
<v Speaker 1>relative to body and neural conduction</v>
<v Speaker 1>speed and simple reaction time,</v>

33
00:02:00.511 --> 00:02:04.050
<v Speaker 1>like really basic physiological markers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

34
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.630
<v Speaker 1>and it's a pretty tight single factors</v>
<v Speaker 1>say as opposed to the personality</v>

35
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.810
<v Speaker 1>dimension domain where there's five</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite clear factors.</v>

36
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.230
<v Speaker 1>But I think it was Earl hunt research</v>
<v Speaker 1>indicated that as people get smarter and</v>

37
00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:22.590
<v Speaker 1>smarter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the variability between the subsets of</v>

38
00:02:22.591 --> 00:02:25.230
<v Speaker 1>their intelligence starts to increase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's sort of like,</v>

39
00:02:25.231 --> 00:02:27.030
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of ways to be really</v>
<v Speaker 1>smart,</v>

40
00:02:27.031 --> 00:02:29.670
<v Speaker 1>but there's only one way to be not very</v>
<v Speaker 1>smart.</v>

41
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.820
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

42
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.550
<v Speaker 1>that's another little tidbit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>information with regards to Iq.</v>
