1
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.990
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the transhumanist would respond to that.</v>

2
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.100
<v Speaker 1>You're just used to this idea of only</v>
<v Speaker 1>living 80,</v>

3
00:00:13.101 --> 00:00:15.430
<v Speaker 1>90 years and then you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:16.850
<v Speaker 1>that we would adjust to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5
00:00:16.851 --> 00:00:17.684
<v Speaker 1>maybe</v>

6
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.740
<v Speaker 2>the other question would be who would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>the weed that would adjust to that?</v>

7
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.840
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would no longer okay to get there.</v>

8
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.140
<v Speaker 1>We would really no longer be human</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

9
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.030
<v Speaker 1>The idea of the transhumanist and</v>
<v Speaker 1>singularitarian people is,</v>

10
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.760
<v Speaker 1>is truly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not human anymore.</v>

11
00:00:33.761 --> 00:00:37.570
<v Speaker 1>We have brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the cochlear implant for hearing is</v>

12
00:00:37.571 --> 00:00:40.280
<v Speaker 1>a kind of brain transplant device.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

13
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.940
<v Speaker 1>they want to ramp that up and put chips</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your cortex and you'd hit said</v>

14
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.230
<v Speaker 1>essentially have Wikipedia in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

15
00:00:47.231 --> 00:00:50.490
<v Speaker 1>It's for instant access and so and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it,</v>

16
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.410
<v Speaker 1>it would truly bring new meaning to what</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means to be human.</v>

17
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.170
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could also argue that that's a form</v>

18
00:00:57.171 --> 00:01:00.050
<v Speaker 2>of death because if you transform</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>

19
00:01:00.051 --> 00:01:02.090
<v Speaker 2>so without it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're unrecognizable.</v>

20
00:01:02.091 --> 00:01:05.150
<v Speaker 2>Then what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's the continuity with what you</v>

21
00:01:05.151 --> 00:01:06.740
<v Speaker 2>once were?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

22
00:01:06.741 --> 00:01:09.830
<v Speaker 2>this is one of the reasons I have some</v>
<v Speaker 2>real sympathy for many reasons.</v>

23
00:01:09.831 --> 00:01:12.650
<v Speaker 2>I have many reasons for this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of them that I have very much</v>

24
00:01:12.651 --> 00:01:13.820
<v Speaker 2>sympathy for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea,</v>

25
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.780
<v Speaker 2>the Christian idea that's that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with the mortality of the</v>

26
00:01:17.781 --> 00:01:21.710
<v Speaker 2>resurrection of the body because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christians insisted that this is not</v>

27
00:01:21.711 --> 00:01:25.790
<v Speaker 2>some sort of abstract life like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not uploaded into a computer.</v>

28
00:01:25.791 --> 00:01:29.060
<v Speaker 2>It's not blowing out all of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>limitations.</v>

29
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.810
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

30
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.990
<v Speaker 2>you might ask what the resurrected body</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be and of course that's a</v>

31
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.180
<v Speaker 2>particularly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a perfectly fine question,</v>

32
00:01:35.181 --> 00:01:37.310
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't.</v>

33
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.260
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't move you around the fact</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there was a question that was</v>

34
00:01:45.261 --> 00:01:48.530
<v Speaker 2>really to be grappled with there because</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the Christians were trying to do</v>

35
00:01:48.531 --> 00:01:51.980
<v Speaker 2>was to have their take and eat it too in</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sense and to say,</v>

36
00:01:51.981 --> 00:01:54.710
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some out salute utility to the</v>

37
00:01:54.711 --> 00:01:58.790
<v Speaker 2>limitation that's imposed upon you by a</v>
<v Speaker 2>mortal frame.</v>

38
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.920
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the characteristic element of</v>

39
00:02:00.921 --> 00:02:04.720
<v Speaker 2>being human and that perhaps there's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>way of having that in transcending it up</v>

40
00:02:04.721 --> 00:02:07.010
<v Speaker 2>at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what that would look like is</v>

41
00:02:07.011 --> 00:02:07.844
<v Speaker 2>obviously by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

42
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.910
<v Speaker 1>I deal with that and Evan's on her to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a chapter on the soul and you know,</v>

43
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.480
<v Speaker 1>post Descartes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christians became more doulas before</v>

44
00:02:15.481 --> 00:02:18.240
<v Speaker 1>that they were more focused on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical resurrection of the body.</v>

45
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.930
<v Speaker 1>There are still some Christian sex today</v>
<v Speaker 1>who think that they'll physically be</v>

46
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.560
<v Speaker 1>resurrected but most more of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of them are do list and it's just</v>

47
00:02:25.561 --> 00:02:27.600
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just this kind of nonphysical thing</v>

48
00:02:27.601 --> 00:02:31.440
<v Speaker 1>that goes and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and be and is with God and Jesus and so</v>

49
00:02:31.441 --> 00:02:32.490
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

50
00:02:32.491 --> 00:02:33.324
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

51
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.500
<v Speaker 1>but they actually debate this</v>
<v Speaker 1>question of identity,</v>

52
00:02:37.501 --> 00:02:38.990
<v Speaker 1>the problem with identity because he</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

53
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.280
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're physically resurrected in</v>

54
00:02:41.281 --> 00:02:42.990
<v Speaker 1>heaven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>

55
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.030
<v Speaker 1>what's there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How old are you?</v>

56
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.250
<v Speaker 1>And some of them actually have an</v>
<v Speaker 1>answer.</v>

57
00:02:47.251 --> 00:02:50.580
<v Speaker 1>You're 30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like the ideal age physically I</v>

58
00:02:50.581 --> 00:02:53.580
<v Speaker 1>suppose mentally to be third and also</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus was 30</v>

59
00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:56.431
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

60
00:02:56.431 --> 00:02:57.310
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

61
00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.090
<v Speaker 1>but then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is know,</v>

62
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.040
<v Speaker 1>and I ask this question for the mindup</v>
<v Speaker 1>loaders and the transhumanist,</v>

63
00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:06.350
<v Speaker 1>it's like there is no fixed self,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

64
00:03:06.351 --> 00:03:10.420
<v Speaker 1>all your cells near the ad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost all the atoms in your body or</v>

65
00:03:10.421 --> 00:03:12.040
<v Speaker 1>recycle about every decade or so.</v>

66
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.560
<v Speaker 1>So there is no defined physical self of</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

67
00:03:15.561 --> 00:03:18.460
<v Speaker 1>You know that theses ship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you replace all the wood and the ship,</v>

68
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.390
<v Speaker 1>we still call it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the pattern structure.</v>

69
00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:23.920
<v Speaker 1>That was Schrodinger's term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

70
00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:24.754
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

71
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:25.300
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

72
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.400
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's the pattern of information that</v>

73
00:03:27.401 --> 00:03:29.860
<v Speaker 1>is your memories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your memory cells,</v>

74
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:30.880
<v Speaker 1>memory cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

75
00:03:30.881 --> 00:03:31.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

76
00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:32.830
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's better.</v>

77
00:03:32.831 --> 00:03:35.320
<v Speaker 1>But at what age?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

78
00:03:35.321 --> 00:03:38.680
<v Speaker 1>because I have memories now that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have when I was 30 so what</v>

79
00:03:38.681 --> 00:03:42.220
<v Speaker 1>happens if I'm resurrected at age 30</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's all the memories of my last,</v>

80
00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:45.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm 63 now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last 33 years of memories of that.</v>

81
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.160
<v Speaker 1>I want those too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so just okay,</v>

82
00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:49.840
<v Speaker 1>you can have all those memories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but wait,</v>

83
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.730
<v Speaker 1>the memories I have now at 63 of when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was 30 are very different than the</v>

84
00:03:54.731 --> 00:03:58.060
<v Speaker 1>memories when I was 30 of of what I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like at that time.</v>

85
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.470
<v Speaker 1>And so there's no fixed set of memories</v>
<v Speaker 1>even that represents you.</v>

86
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.650
<v Speaker 1>Cause those are constantly edited and</v>
<v Speaker 1>changed and reinterpret it.</v>

87
00:04:05.651 --> 00:04:06.880
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

88
00:04:06.881 --> 00:04:10.420
<v Speaker 1>now I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I had that 10 years as a bike racer</v>

89
00:04:10.421 --> 00:04:12.600
<v Speaker 1>in the 1980s I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

90
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.270
<v Speaker 1>I was just sort of going through doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>my thing and now I see in context what</v>

91
00:04:16.271 --> 00:04:18.730
<v Speaker 1>that meant for my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I didn't know it at the time.</v>

92
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.240
<v Speaker 1>That's true for everything we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I always laugh when people</v>

93
00:04:22.241 --> 00:04:24.250
<v Speaker 1>write memoirs in their twenties or</v>
<v Speaker 1>thirties.</v>

94
00:04:24.251 --> 00:04:27.040
<v Speaker 1>It's like how can you write a memoir?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have no idea what you're doing</v>

95
00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.700
<v Speaker 1>going now is going to meet in 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in religious,</v>

96
00:04:30.701 --> 00:04:33.490
<v Speaker 1>so both,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both scientific attempts at immortality</v>

97
00:04:33.491 --> 00:04:35.920
<v Speaker 1>mortality or the afterlife or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and religious,</v>

98
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.470
<v Speaker 1>they have the same problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

99
00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is up there that's being</v>

100
00:04:39.611 --> 00:04:41.620
<v Speaker 1>resurrected because there is no fixed</v>
<v Speaker 1>self.</v>

101
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.900
<v Speaker 1>It's a constantly dynamic changing</v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

102
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.410
<v Speaker 1>And then there's one more problem that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with the point of view self,</v>

103
00:04:47.411 --> 00:04:48.700
<v Speaker 1>the Pov cells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

104
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.960
<v Speaker 1>there's uni looking out through your</v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes and you Jordan go to sleep tonight.</v>

105
00:04:52.961 --> 00:04:55.410
<v Speaker 1>You wake up tomorrow morning and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>groggy for a few minutes but,</v>

106
00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.900
<v Speaker 1>but your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your point of view returns and you know</v>

107
00:04:58.901 --> 00:05:00.220
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the singularity people,</v>

108
00:05:00.221 --> 00:05:00.641
<v Speaker 1>they think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

109
00:05:00.641 --> 00:05:04.210
<v Speaker 1>we'll copy all your memories and put</v>
<v Speaker 1>them in a computer and it will turn it</v>

110
00:05:04.211 --> 00:05:06.850
<v Speaker 1>on and you'll wake up and you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll be looking out through the little</v>

111
00:05:06.851 --> 00:05:08.470
<v Speaker 1>camera hold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like Johnny Depp in</v>

112
00:05:08.471 --> 00:05:11.080
<v Speaker 1>transcendence and you'll be in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

113
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would your point of view all of a</v>

114
00:05:14.651 --> 00:05:19.330
<v Speaker 1>sudden leap from your current body into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the computer in the same sense that</v>

115
00:05:19.331 --> 00:05:22.930
<v Speaker 1>instead of sacrificing your brain and</v>
<v Speaker 1>slicing it up and scanning,</v>

116
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.140
<v Speaker 1>this is the current thoughts scanning</v>
<v Speaker 1>every sinaps.</v>

117
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.220
<v Speaker 1>What if in a hundred years from now we</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a sophisticated Fmr I machine that</v>

118
00:05:30.221 --> 00:05:34.200
<v Speaker 1>could scan your brain and scan every</v>
<v Speaker 1>single synapse and reproduce it.</v>

119
00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.120
<v Speaker 1>We had a computer big enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moore's law doubling and so on.</v>

120
00:05:37.121 --> 00:05:41.980
<v Speaker 1>It would be enough to just to reproduce</v>
<v Speaker 1>your entire connectome and turned it up,</v>

121
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.730
<v Speaker 1>but you're you Jordan Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's still standing there right next to</v>

122
00:05:45.731 --> 00:05:48.750
<v Speaker 1>the computer and they turn it on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not all of a sudden</v>

123
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.230
<v Speaker 1>the absolute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

124
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.950
<v Speaker 1>there's other problems with that too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>

125
00:05:53.951 --> 00:05:57.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>

126
00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 1>you</v>

127
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.790
<v Speaker 2>have more neurons in your autonomic</v>
<v Speaker 2>nervous system then you have in your</v>

128
00:06:01.791 --> 00:06:02.900
<v Speaker 2>central nervous system.</v>

129
00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:04.923
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

130
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.840
<v Speaker 2>what are you going to do about this man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that isn't in your head,</v>

131
00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.300
<v Speaker 1>not just your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have an extended buddy,</v>

132
00:06:13.301 --> 00:06:16.420
<v Speaker 1>so you ionics people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they love up the head.</v>

133
00:06:16.421 --> 00:06:17.620
<v Speaker 1>We're just going to clone your butt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

134
00:06:17.621 --> 00:06:20.230
<v Speaker 1>this is getting too complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they really need the whole body.</v>

135
00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:21.670
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's again,</v>

136
00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.030
<v Speaker 2>that's the physical resurrection issue</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the idea that,</v>

137
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.100
<v Speaker 2>and I think that you put your finger on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the floor in the,</v>

138
00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:29.190
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

139
00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:32.230
<v Speaker 2>in the new immortelle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the new immortality crowd.</v>

140
00:06:32.231 --> 00:06:34.190
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think they really are [inaudible]</v>

141
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.550
<v Speaker 2>and they think of your consciousness is</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's,</v>

142
00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.220
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're confused about it in some sense</v>

143
00:06:39.221 --> 00:06:41.440
<v Speaker 2>because they think of it as a kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>soul,</v>

144
00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.680
<v Speaker 2>which would be a pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that pattern is only instantiated in</v>

145
00:06:44.681 --> 00:06:45.610
<v Speaker 2>the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

146
00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.590
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>physiologically that's just not the</v>

147
00:06:47.591 --> 00:06:50.170
<v Speaker 2>case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like what about the hormones?</v>

148
00:06:50.171 --> 00:06:52.930
<v Speaker 2>What about like there's a look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of things going on in the</v>

149
00:06:52.931 --> 00:06:57.130
<v Speaker 2>brain that aren't easily reducible to</v>
<v Speaker 2>synaptic patterns,</v>

150
00:06:57.131 --> 00:07:00.640
<v Speaker 2>especially when you consider also its</v>
<v Speaker 2>connection with the body and you have to</v>

151
00:07:00.641 --> 00:07:01.390
<v Speaker 2>consider that.</v>
