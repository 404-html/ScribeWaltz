1
00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:08.280
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.113
<v Speaker 1>who does?</v>

3
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:13.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm against poverty.</v>

4
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.101
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5
00:00:14.101 --> 00:00:16.440
<v Speaker 1>that's like classic protest sign.</v>

6
00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:16.801
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

7
00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:17.634
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

8
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.910
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm against torture.</v>

9
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:21.773
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

10
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.670
<v Speaker 1>it's so obvious you don't get any Brownie points for being against poverty.</v>

11
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.460
<v Speaker 1>No one in their right mind is for poverty.</v>

12
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.780
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

13
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:32.031
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

14
00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:33.300
<v Speaker 1>You ever watched the Simpsons?</v>

15
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.390
<v Speaker 1>You ever see the,</v>

16
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.350
<v Speaker 1>the Republican Party in the Simpsons,</v>

17
00:00:37.351 --> 00:00:41.400
<v Speaker 1>they all meet in an old haunted castle at night with like lightening bolts going</v>

18
00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:43.430
<v Speaker 1>off and there's a vampire and a crazy tax.</v>

19
00:00:43.431 --> 00:00:48.431
<v Speaker 1>And then even the Simpson Republicans don't sit around in the haunted tower at</v>

20
00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:51.210
<v Speaker 1>midnight saying the way we need more poverty.</v>

21
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.193
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

22
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.420
<v Speaker 1>here's an interesting thing.</v>

23
00:01:00.421 --> 00:01:04.720
<v Speaker 1>So one of the postmodernist claims is that diversity is necessary and they make</v>

24
00:01:04.721 --> 00:01:07.010
<v Speaker 1>it racial and they make it sexual.</v>

25
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.150
<v Speaker 1>They may get ethnic and all of that.</v>

26
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.520
<v Speaker 1>That's actually technically incorrect by the way,</v>

27
00:01:11.521 --> 00:01:12.354
<v Speaker 1>because</v>

28
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.870
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

29
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.820
<v Speaker 1>I study individual differences.</v>

30
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.920
<v Speaker 1>So those are the differences between people.</v>

31
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:19.080
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

32
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.191
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

33
00:01:19.191 --> 00:01:19.350
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

34
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.951
<v Speaker 1>The literature.</v>

35
00:01:19.951 --> 00:01:23.700
<v Speaker 1>So you know about James Tomorrows memo right from Google.</v>

36
00:01:23.701 --> 00:01:25.890
<v Speaker 1>He wrote that partly because he was watching my videos,</v>

37
00:01:25.891 --> 00:01:27.720
<v Speaker 1>which is why he wanted me to interview him.</v>

38
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.730
<v Speaker 1>And I'm a believer that there are biological differences in temperament between</v>

39
00:01:32.731 --> 00:01:33.564
<v Speaker 1>men and women,</v>

40
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.220
<v Speaker 1>apart from the other obvious differences and that they're actually not trivial.</v>

41
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:38.320
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

42
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.590
<v Speaker 1>And that they maximize in the societies that have the most,</v>

43
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.090
<v Speaker 1>have moved farther as to producing egalitarian states,</v>

44
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.350
<v Speaker 1>Scandinavian countries,</v>

45
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.350
<v Speaker 1>and that the reason for that is that there's two reasons why men and women,</v>

46
00:01:50.351 --> 00:01:51.220
<v Speaker 1>different temperament.</v>

47
00:01:51.221 --> 00:01:53.860
<v Speaker 1>One is biological and the other is environmental.</v>

48
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.650
<v Speaker 1>And if you remove the environmental variation,</v>

49
00:01:56.651 --> 00:01:57.161
<v Speaker 1>which you do,</v>

50
00:01:57.161 --> 00:01:58.690
<v Speaker 1>if you make the state egalitarian,</v>

51
00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.880
<v Speaker 1>you maximize the genetic variation.</v>

52
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.590
<v Speaker 1>And that's been demonstrated in the scientific literature over about four</v>

53
00:02:05.591 --> 00:02:08.470
<v Speaker 1>decades and no one wanted it or hope for it.</v>

54
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.040
<v Speaker 1>And they weren't biased in looking for it because that was exactly the opposite</v>

55
00:02:12.041 --> 00:02:13.840
<v Speaker 1>of what social scientists wanted to find.</v>

56
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.530
<v Speaker 1>Because social scientists lean heavily to the left and what they wanted to find</v>

57
00:02:17.531 --> 00:02:21.550
<v Speaker 1>was you flatten out the state so that everyone has equal opportunity and the</v>

58
00:02:21.551 --> 00:02:23.440
<v Speaker 1>differences between people disappear.</v>

59
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.800
<v Speaker 1>That is not what happened.</v>

60
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.070
<v Speaker 1>The opposite happened that wasn't wrong and no one was happy about it and no</v>

61
00:02:30.491 --> 00:02:31.271
<v Speaker 1>one's happy about it.</v>

62
00:02:31.271 --> 00:02:35.230
<v Speaker 1>Now you can actually tell when you've discovered something in the social science</v>

63
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.110
<v Speaker 1>cause you're not happy about it.</v>

64
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.193
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

65
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:47.150
<v Speaker 1>if you take,</v>

66
00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.360
<v Speaker 1>let's say there's a big difference between men and women in terms of trait,</v>

67
00:02:50.361 --> 00:02:51.200
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness,</v>

68
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:53.690
<v Speaker 1>compassion and politeness.</v>

69
00:02:53.691 --> 00:02:54.261
<v Speaker 1>On average,</v>

70
00:02:54.261 --> 00:02:56.030
<v Speaker 1>women are more agreeable than men.</v>

71
00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.610
<v Speaker 1>And the difference is approximately this.</v>

72
00:02:58.611 --> 00:03:01.840
<v Speaker 1>If you random pairs of men and women out of the population,</v>

73
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.510
<v Speaker 1>let's say you had to make a bet on who was more agreeable.</v>

74
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.010
<v Speaker 1>If you bet that it was the woman,</v>

75
00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:07.870
<v Speaker 1>you'd be right 60% of the time.</v>

76
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.300
<v Speaker 1>Well that's not that much.</v>

77
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.610
<v Speaker 1>It means you'd be wrong 40% of the time.</v>

78
00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:14.740
<v Speaker 1>That's almost 50% of the time.</v>

79
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.010
<v Speaker 1>So this is a big difference by social science standards,</v>

80
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.830
<v Speaker 1>but that's the magnitude of the difference.</v>

81
00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:22.450
<v Speaker 1>There are some differences that are bigger,</v>

82
00:03:22.451 --> 00:03:26.020
<v Speaker 1>like the difference between men and women's interest in people versus things is</v>

83
00:03:26.021 --> 00:03:26.980
<v Speaker 1>actually bigger than that.</v>

84
00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:28.360
<v Speaker 1>That's the biggest difference we know,</v>

85
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:29.860
<v Speaker 1>but it's a big difference.</v>

86
00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:31.450
<v Speaker 1>Let's say the agreeable this difference,</v>

87
00:03:31.451 --> 00:03:34.260
<v Speaker 1>but still they,</v>

88
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.540
<v Speaker 1>the shared attributes of men and women far outweigh the attributes that</v>

89
00:03:40.051 --> 00:03:41.020
<v Speaker 1>differentiate them.</v>

90
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.090
<v Speaker 1>Because you could ask are there more differences within groups or between them?</v>

91
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.720
<v Speaker 1>Now the postmodern answered that is between them.</v>

92
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.170
<v Speaker 1>That's why you need diversity by group,</v>

93
00:03:53.171 --> 00:03:53.680
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

94
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.970
<v Speaker 1>That's why you need different races.</v>

95
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.120
<v Speaker 1>That's why you need different ethnicities and sexual preferences and all of</v>

96
00:03:58.121 --> 00:03:58.954
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

97
00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.590
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

98
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:00.640
<v Speaker 1>that's wrong.</v>

99
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.480
<v Speaker 1>There's more difference within the groups than there is between them.</v>

100
00:04:04.481 --> 00:04:07.720
<v Speaker 1>You don't get diversity by crossing the groups.</v>

101
00:04:07.721 --> 00:04:08.680
<v Speaker 1>You'd get diversity by,</v>

102
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.170
<v Speaker 1>by selecting across individuals.</v>

103
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.891
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

104
00:04:11.891 --> 00:04:15.450
<v Speaker 1>the idea that there is more differences between groups and there is between</v>

105
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.150
<v Speaker 1>individuals is actually the fundamental racist idea.</v>

106
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.310
<v Speaker 1>It's the fundamental racist idea,</v>

107
00:04:21.311 --> 00:04:21.910
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

108
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:22.091
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

109
00:04:22.091 --> 00:04:23.230
<v Speaker 1>let's say you're</v>

110
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.000
<v Speaker 3>Asian Oriental,</v>

111
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.650
<v Speaker 1>to use the old word to discriminate</v>

112
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.690
<v Speaker 3>the one type of Asian say from the other.</v>

113
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.690
<v Speaker 1>You're so different from me that there's no overlap between our groups and</v>

114
00:04:36.691 --> 00:04:41.010
<v Speaker 1>you're all so different and there's so little difference within your group that</v>

115
00:04:41.011 --> 00:04:42.900
<v Speaker 1>now that I know that you're not me,</v>

116
00:04:42.901 --> 00:04:43.770
<v Speaker 1>you're not one of mine.</v>

117
00:04:43.771 --> 00:04:45.240
<v Speaker 1>I actually know what you're like.</v>

118
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:47.483
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

119
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.500
<v Speaker 1>technically that's incorrect.</v>

120
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:50.460
<v Speaker 1>That's wrong.</v>

121
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.140
<v Speaker 1>That isn't how you get diversity.</v>
