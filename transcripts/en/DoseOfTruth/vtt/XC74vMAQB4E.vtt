00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm also working on my new book quite a lot actually.</v>

2
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:12.420
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.420
<v Speaker 1>it's tentatively titled Beyond Order 12 more rules for life or perhaps beyond</v>

4
00:00:18.331 --> 00:00:19.200
<v Speaker 1>mere order.</v>

5
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.210
<v Speaker 1>I haven't decided on that yet.</v>

6
00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:22.743
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

7
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.600
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you what the rules are.</v>

8
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.070
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you'd be interested in that.</v>

9
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.950
<v Speaker 1>So I'll give you a list of them.</v>

10
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:34.370
<v Speaker 1>The first one is do not carelessly denigrate social institutions or creative</v>

11
00:00:36.511 --> 00:00:37.344
<v Speaker 1>achievement</v>

12
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.040
<v Speaker 1>rule to imagine who you could be.</v>

13
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.550
<v Speaker 1>And then aim singlemindedly at that</v>

14
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.990
<v Speaker 1>rule three.</v>

15
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.610
<v Speaker 1>Work as hard as you can.</v>

16
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.120
<v Speaker 1>Work as hard as you possibly can on at least one thing and see what happens.</v>

17
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.530
<v Speaker 1>Rule four,</v>

18
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.460
<v Speaker 1>do not hide unwanted things in the fog.</v>

19
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:03.560
<v Speaker 1>Rule five,</v>

20

21
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.970
<v Speaker 1>notice that opportunity lurks where responsibility has been abdicated.</v>

22
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:15.770
<v Speaker 1>Rule seven,</v>

23
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.500
<v Speaker 1>do not do things that you hate.</v>

24
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.001
<v Speaker 1>Rural.</v>

25
00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:20.690
<v Speaker 1>Eight,</v>

26
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.990
<v Speaker 1>try to make one room in your house as beautiful as possible.</v>

27
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.940
<v Speaker 1>Rule Nine,</v>

28
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.510
<v Speaker 1>if old memories still make you cry,</v>

29
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.180
<v Speaker 1>right them down carefully and completely</v>

30
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.280
<v Speaker 1>rural 10 plan and work diligently to maintain the romance in your relationship.</v>

31
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:42.260
<v Speaker 1>Rule 11,</v>

32
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.050
<v Speaker 1>be grateful in spite of your suffering.</v>

33
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.540
<v Speaker 1>And then rule 12,</v>

34
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.330
<v Speaker 1>do not allow yourself to become resentful,</v>

35
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:51.201
<v Speaker 1>deceitful,</v>

36
00:01:51.201 --> 00:01:52.070
<v Speaker 1>or arrogant.</v>

37
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:53.990
<v Speaker 1>In principle,</v>

38
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.920
<v Speaker 1>that book will be published in January,</v>

39
00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.360
<v Speaker 1>2020 so,</v>

40
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.230
<v Speaker 1>and I'm supposed to have the manuscript in sometime within the next six months</v>

41
00:02:03.231 --> 00:02:07.430
<v Speaker 1>and I have a first draft done and I'm working hard on the repeated edits.</v>

42
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:08.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

43
00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.800
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be published simultaneously in the UK and the U S and Canada.</v>

44
00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

45
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm working with three different editors and so that's that part of the</v>

46
00:02:18.951 --> 00:02:19.491
<v Speaker 1>announcement.</v>

47
00:02:19.491 --> 00:02:20.510
<v Speaker 1>So I'm hoping,</v>

48
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm really hoping that I can make the next book better.</v>

49
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.410
<v Speaker 1>I think it would be a pair,</v>

50
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.110
<v Speaker 1>you'll be a parent coffee with the first one.</v>

51
00:02:27.111 --> 00:02:30.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm probably going to publish it with a black cover to go with the white cover</v>

52
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:31.880
<v Speaker 1>of 12 rules,</v>

53
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.780
<v Speaker 1>and I'm hoping that I can make it into a better book and that the two together</v>

54
00:02:35.781 --> 00:02:37.490
<v Speaker 1>will make a very complete set.</v>
