<v Speaker 1>of a provincial elite as in and so on,</v>

10
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.060
<v Speaker 1>but in point of fact as a student of history of the arts,</v>

11
00:00:24.061 --> 00:00:24.271
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

12

<v Speaker 1>People the cannon.</v>

17
00:00:27.221 --> 00:00:27.920
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

18
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.520
<v Speaker 1>The overwhelmingly so is is the result of what artists have determined,</v>

19
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:32.761
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

20
00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:32.921
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

21
00:00:32.921 --> 00:00:33.080
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

22
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.090
<v Speaker 1>we did we say a work is important.</v>

23
00:00:36.091 --> 00:00:38.790
<v Speaker 1>It's canonical because artists following it.</v>

24
00:00:38.791 --> 00:00:39.091
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

25
00:00:39.091 --> 00:00:42.840
<v Speaker 1>We're influenced by it and we have this like beautiful cascading tradition of</v>

26
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:43.740
<v Speaker 1>influence.</v>

27
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:44.360
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

28
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.940
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

29
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.520
<v Speaker 1>that's another part of the Philistinism.</v>

30
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.040
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

31
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.920
<v Speaker 1>I've current education to,</v>

<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

33
00:00:50.131 --> 00:00:50.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.310
<v Speaker 1>to believe that there are these external reasons for why a work last,</v>

35
00:00:55.471 --> 00:00:56.304
<v Speaker 1>why a work,</v>

36
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.591
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

37
00:00:56.591 --> 00:00:59.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm a written 500 years ago or a thousand years ago,</v>

38
00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.830
<v Speaker 1>has it</v>

39
00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.810
<v Speaker 2>global relevance as if it's some sort of political conspiracy based on power as</v>

40
00:01:04.811 --> 00:01:08.440
<v Speaker 2>if anybody could even manage that no matter how nefarious they weren't.</v>

41
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:09.440
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

42
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.071
<v Speaker 1>But also,</v>

43
00:01:10.071 --> 00:01:10.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:11.280
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

45
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.481
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

46
00:01:11.481 --> 00:01:12.510
<v Speaker 1>in the 60s you ain't had the,</v>

47
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:13.191
<v Speaker 1>had the idea.</v>

48
00:01:13.191 --> 00:01:13.371
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

49
00:01:13.371 --> 00:01:14.204
<v Speaker 1>Then there was a,</v>

50
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:14.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

51
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.690
<v Speaker 1>human human sensibility that transcendent individual nations and so on.</v>

52
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:21.090
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

53
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.591
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

54
00:01:21.591 --> 00:01:24.380
<v Speaker 1>and that there was this like rubric,</v>

55
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.010
<v Speaker 1>cosmic consciousness and this son,</v>

56
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.390
<v Speaker 1>this a sense of the universe as a whole.</v>

57
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.370
<v Speaker 1>And to see the human being in relationship to great eternal principles of,</v>

58
00:01:34.371 --> 00:01:34.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

59
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.840
<v Speaker 1>of life and death,</v>

60
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.190
<v Speaker 1>mortality and so on.</v>

61
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.911
<v Speaker 1>Whereas,</v>

62
00:01:37.911 --> 00:01:38.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

63
00:01:38.061 --> 00:01:39.520
<v Speaker 1>Marxism is blind.</v>

64
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.390
<v Speaker 1>Marxism is very narrow.</v>

65
00:01:41.391 --> 00:01:43.010
<v Speaker 1>All it sees is a society.</v>

66
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.670
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

67
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.770
<v Speaker 1>It says nothing be on society.</v>

68
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.060
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem nature.</v>

69
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.530
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

70
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

71
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.010
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely mad.</v>

72
00:01:49.011 --> 00:01:49.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

73
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.800
<v Speaker 1>how are you going to have a system being taught,</v>

74
00:01:51.801 --> 00:01:52.011
<v Speaker 1>okay?</v>

75
00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:52.844
<v Speaker 1>And universities,</v>

76
00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:53.210
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

77
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.480
<v Speaker 1>Which,</v>

78
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.691
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

79
00:01:53.691 --> 00:01:54.050
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

80
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.390
<v Speaker 1>which thinks at this tiny thing of society.</v>

81
00:01:56.391 --> 00:01:56.840
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

82
00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.570
<v Speaker 1>Compared to the enormity and beauty of nature,</v>

83
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.123
<v Speaker 1>it should take all of,</v>

84
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

85
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:02.510
<v Speaker 1>all of our,</v>

86
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.751
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

87
00:02:02.751 --> 00:02:04.850
<v Speaker 1>absorb all of our energy and attention.</v>

88
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.360
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

89
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.571
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

90
00:02:05.571 --> 00:02:09.440
<v Speaker 1>I just think that there's like a parochialism and provincialism uh,</v>

91
00:02:09.441 --> 00:02:09.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

92
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.080
<v Speaker 1>it and now all kinds of,</v>

93
00:02:12.081 --> 00:02:12.360
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

94
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.193
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

95
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.330
<v Speaker 1>systematized,</v>

96
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.770
<v Speaker 1>elite TISM in our current education.</v>

97
00:02:16.771 --> 00:02:18.220
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be rooted out and we,</v>

98
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.700
<v Speaker 1>I want to return to basics.</v>

99
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.301
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

100
00:02:20.301 --> 00:02:25.010
<v Speaker 1>Simplicities and all these faculty members teaching their little tiny courses</v>

101
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.521
<v Speaker 1>that have to,</v>

102
00:02:25.521 --> 00:02:26.900
<v Speaker 1>has to do with our own specialty.</v>

103
00:02:26.901 --> 00:02:27.740
<v Speaker 1>That's got to stop.</v>

104
00:02:27.741 --> 00:02:28.400
<v Speaker 1>What can people,</v>

105
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.190
<v Speaker 1>people can pursue whatever they want in their private research.</v>

106
00:02:31.191 --> 00:02:31.880
<v Speaker 1>A scholars.</v>

107
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:32.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

108
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.470
<v Speaker 1>Certainly that's necessary,</v>

109
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.680
<v Speaker 1>but they must teach in the core curriculum and,</v>

110
00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.660
<v Speaker 1>and people must decide what is crucial for an educated person to know.</v>

111
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.220
<v Speaker 1>I do want a multicultural.</v>

112
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.260
<v Speaker 1>I do want to global curriculum like I want,</v>

113
00:02:45.261 --> 00:02:46.940
<v Speaker 1>I want all the cultures taught.</v>

114
00:02:46.941 --> 00:02:47.260
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

115
00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.960
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

116
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.310
<v Speaker 1>This is not the answer.</v>

117
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.750
<v Speaker 1>Martin Marxism,</v>

118
00:02:50.751 --> 00:02:52.880
<v Speaker 1>this neo Marxism in the university's okay.</v>

119
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.020
<v Speaker 1>Is simply,</v>

120
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.130
<v Speaker 1>it's lazy.</v>

121
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.540
<v Speaker 1>It's a lazy way to assert multiculturalism without actually doing the research</v>

122
00:02:59.541 --> 00:03:01.730
<v Speaker 1>and the study of other cultures.</v>

123
00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.250
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

124
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.083
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

125
00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.640
<v Speaker 1>We agreed on everything.</v>

126
00:03:07.641 --> 00:03:09.310
<v Speaker 1>I knew this.</v>

127
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.120
<v Speaker 1>I knew that.</v>

128
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.371
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

129
00:03:10.371 --> 00:03:10.730
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
