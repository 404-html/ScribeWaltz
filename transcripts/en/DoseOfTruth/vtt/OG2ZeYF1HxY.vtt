1
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.060
<v Speaker 1>And then we'll get to the Q.</v>

2
00:00:10.061 --> 00:00:10.151
<v Speaker 1>And.</v>

3
00:00:10.151 --> 00:00:10.640
<v Speaker 1>A.</v>

4
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:11.473
<v Speaker 1>I think this,</v>

5
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.450
<v Speaker 1>this is the kind of thing that I'd like to shed light on in any possible lecture</v>

6
00:00:16.451 --> 00:00:17.590
<v Speaker 1>series on marks.</v>

7
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.950
<v Speaker 1>So this is called any advice on effectively implementing what I learned into my</v>

8
00:00:24.641 --> 00:00:25.090
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

9
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.430
<v Speaker 1>I resonate with 12 rules so much when reading,</v>

10
00:00:27.431 --> 00:00:30.190
<v Speaker 1>but struggle to remember it in my day to day life.</v>

11
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

12
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:31.690
<v Speaker 1>you're not alone.</v>

13
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.680
<v Speaker 1>That was Sam.</v>

14
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:33.730
<v Speaker 1>You're not alone in that,</v>

15
00:00:33.731 --> 00:00:34.564
<v Speaker 1>Sam.</v>

16
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.961
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

17
00:00:34.961 --> 00:00:35.501
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

18
00:00:35.501 --> 00:00:37.450
<v Speaker 1>you got to figure out what your timeframe is.</v>

19
00:00:37.451 --> 00:00:38.080
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

20
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.530
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

21
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.530
<v Speaker 1>one of the truisms of clinical psychology is that slow and incremental</v>

22
00:00:45.161 --> 00:00:46.900
<v Speaker 1>improvement is first of all,</v>

23
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.480
<v Speaker 1>normative in the best possible way,</v>

24
00:00:49.481 --> 00:00:51.130
<v Speaker 1>in the most optimistic situation,</v>

25
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.600
<v Speaker 1>but also very powerful.</v>

26
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.050
<v Speaker 1>And so of course you struggled to remember it in your day to day life because</v>

27
00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.320
<v Speaker 1>life is difficult and it's harder to do things the not to do them.</v>

28
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.600
<v Speaker 1>And it's harder to do them well than to do them badly.</v>

29
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:02.291
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

30
00:01:02.291 --> 00:01:04.390
<v Speaker 1>And it's easy to sit around and be hopeless.</v>

31
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean it's emotionally easy because it's not,</v>

32
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.100
<v Speaker 1>but it's procedural,</v>

33
00:01:09.101 --> 00:01:10.600
<v Speaker 1>easy to be useless.</v>

34
00:01:10.601 --> 00:01:14.950
<v Speaker 1>And to fall back into your old habits and to not discipline yourself.</v>

35
00:01:14.951 --> 00:01:18.160
<v Speaker 1>And it's a matter of continual practice,</v>

36
00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:19.720
<v Speaker 1>slow continual practice.</v>

37
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.530
<v Speaker 1>And I think a good example of that is something like weightlifting.</v>

38
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.801
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

39
00:01:23.801 --> 00:01:25.360
<v Speaker 1>if you start a weightlifting program,</v>

40
00:01:25.361 --> 00:01:27.440
<v Speaker 1>which I would recommend by the way because it,</v>

41
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.480
<v Speaker 1>it's tremendously advantageous physically and cognitively,</v>

42
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.900
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to really see results for a number of weeks and then the</v>

43
00:01:34.901 --> 00:01:36.010
<v Speaker 1>results are rather slow,</v>

44
00:01:36.011 --> 00:01:39.880
<v Speaker 1>but you can get pretty decent results over a six month period and absolutely</v>

45
00:01:39.881 --> 00:01:41.800
<v Speaker 1>stellar results over a couple of years.</v>

46
00:01:41.801 --> 00:01:45.040
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to make sure your timeframe is right and not to be too hard on</v>

47
00:01:45.041 --> 00:01:45.520
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

48
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.910
<v Speaker 1>And I did mention the future authoring program,</v>

49
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.930
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

50
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:50.763
<v Speaker 1>earlier.</v>

51
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.210
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I would recommend too is if you're having a hard time</v>

52
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.310
<v Speaker 1>implementing your,</v>

53
00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:58.660
<v Speaker 1>your decision,</v>

54
00:01:58.661 --> 00:02:02.170
<v Speaker 1>say you're ethical decisions that you spend a bit more time thinking them</v>

55
00:02:02.171 --> 00:02:04.910
<v Speaker 1>through and writing them down in the future authoring program is really helpful</v>

56
00:02:04.911 --> 00:02:05.231
<v Speaker 1>for that.</v>

57
00:02:05.231 --> 00:02:06.550
<v Speaker 1>That's why we designed it.</v>

58
00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.770
<v Speaker 1>And so get your goal straight and continue to practice every day.</v>

59
00:02:11.771 --> 00:02:13.150
<v Speaker 1>And if you're not succeeding,</v>

60
00:02:13.151 --> 00:02:14.980
<v Speaker 1>then make your goal slightly smaller.</v>

61
00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.940
<v Speaker 1>You want to,</v>

62
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.720
<v Speaker 1>you want to make your goals large enough so that they challenge you,</v>

63
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.980
<v Speaker 1>but small enough so that you have a reasonable probability of succeeding at them</v>

64
00:02:23.981 --> 00:02:25.720
<v Speaker 1>on a day to day basis.</v>

65
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.380
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to also understand that if you fail on a given day,</v>

66
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.651
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>

67
00:02:29.651 --> 00:02:32.560
<v Speaker 1>let's say you're trying to quit smoking and you quit for two weeks and then you</v>

68
00:02:32.561 --> 00:02:33.580
<v Speaker 1>have a cigarette and you think,</v>

69
00:02:33.581 --> 00:02:34.151
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

70
00:02:34.151 --> 00:02:35.110
<v Speaker 1>now I've screwed it up.</v>

71
00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.420
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

72
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.780
<v Speaker 1>I've not quitting anymore.</v>

73
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.410
<v Speaker 1>And you smoke a whole pack of cigarettes.</v>

74
00:02:38.411 --> 00:02:38.771
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

75
00:02:38.771 --> 00:02:39.604
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

76
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:41.770
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple of mistakes there.</v>

77
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.903
<v Speaker 1>And one is,</v>

78
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:44.111
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

79
00:02:44.111 --> 00:02:46.870
<v Speaker 1>just because you had a cigarette doesn't mean you failed.</v>

80
00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.910
<v Speaker 1>It just means that you had a cigarette.</v>

81
00:02:48.911 --> 00:02:52.000
<v Speaker 1>You can start stopping again the next day.</v>

82
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.380
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that you had one cigarette in the last two weeks is a hell of a lot</v>

83
00:02:56.381 --> 00:02:58.660
<v Speaker 1>better than the two weeks that you had before that.</v>

84
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.350
<v Speaker 1>And so you've got to be realistically humble.</v>

85
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.890
<v Speaker 1>You gotta be ambitious enough in your goals so that you're pursuing something</v>

86
00:03:05.891 --> 00:03:08.890
<v Speaker 1>that you regard as truly meaningful and worthwhile.</v>

87
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.911
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

88
00:03:09.911 --> 00:03:12.550
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you can judge that to some degree.</v>

89
00:03:12.551 --> 00:03:16.090
<v Speaker 1>If you think about someone you love attempting the same thing and think about</v>

90
00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:17.950
<v Speaker 1>how you would feel if they managed it.</v>

91
00:03:17.951 --> 00:03:19.120
<v Speaker 1>And if you would feel good,</v>

92
00:03:19.121 --> 00:03:20.770
<v Speaker 1>then that's probably a good,</v>

93
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.053
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

94
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.950
<v Speaker 1>what would you say that would be a good</v>

95
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.970
<v Speaker 1>evaluation strategy to use on yourself?</v>

96
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:31.070
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

97
00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.770
<v Speaker 1>so you want your goals to be of sufficient nobility so that you can live with</v>

98
00:03:34.771 --> 00:03:36.630
<v Speaker 1>yourself properly if you're pursuing them,</v>

99
00:03:36.631 --> 00:03:40.050
<v Speaker 1>but you want them to be small enough so that you have a reasonable probability</v>

100
00:03:40.051 --> 00:03:40.861
<v Speaker 1>of implementing them.</v>

101
00:03:40.861 --> 00:03:43.200
<v Speaker 1>And if your implementation,</v>

102
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:50.120
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

103
00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.953
<v Speaker 2>it's good.</v>

104
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:53.783
<v Speaker 2>You can start again.</v>

105
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:03.573
<v Speaker 2>Maybe</v>

106
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.780
<v Speaker 1>we're back.</v>

107
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:07.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

108
00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.093
<v Speaker 1>Okay guys.</v>

109
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:09.001
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

110
00:05:09.001 --> 00:05:09.930
<v Speaker 1>that was interesting.</v>

111
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.180
<v Speaker 1>The software that I use on my camera crashed and then when I reopened it,</v>

112
00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.290
<v Speaker 1>it told me I hadn't purchased it and wanted me to reenter the serial number,</v>

113
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.210
<v Speaker 1>which is quite the interesting experience.</v>

114
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:22.613
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

115
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.740
<v Speaker 1>so I'm just getting my questions back up.</v>

116
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:26.783
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

117
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.760
<v Speaker 1>this three quarter person that you see here is Julian,</v>

118
00:05:29.761 --> 00:05:30.380
<v Speaker 1>who's,</v>

119
00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

120
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.970
<v Speaker 1>reasonably helpful about these sorts of things now.</v>

121
00:05:32.971 --> 00:05:33.804
<v Speaker 1>And then</v>

122
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:36.841
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

123
00:05:36.841 --> 00:05:37.110
<v Speaker 1>Al,</v>

124
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.670
<v Speaker 1>I've almost actually learned how to do this.</v>

125
00:05:38.671 --> 00:05:39.151
<v Speaker 1>I tell you,</v>

126
00:05:39.151 --> 00:05:41.460
<v Speaker 1>you do get slower technologically as you get older.</v>

127
00:05:41.461 --> 00:05:44.760
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of annoying or maybe get just fed up with it more.</v>

128
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:45.653
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to tell.</v>

129
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.570
<v Speaker 1>I think you probably stupider and less patient,</v>

130
00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.650
<v Speaker 1>and so then you justify your less pay your stupidity by just assuming that</v>

131
00:05:52.651 --> 00:05:53.580
<v Speaker 1>you're less patient.</v>

132
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.310
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

133
00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.223
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

134
00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:59.723
<v Speaker 1>we're back.</v>

135
00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:01.463
<v Speaker 1>Thanks Julian.</v>

136
00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
