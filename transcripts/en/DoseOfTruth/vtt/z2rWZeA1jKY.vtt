WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.670
<v Speaker 1>Sacrifice and we'll,</v>

2
00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:04.100
<v Speaker 1>we'll talk more about that too.</v>

3
00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:06.500
<v Speaker 1>You get to pick your damn sacrifice.</v>

4
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:07.640
<v Speaker 1>That's all.</v>

5
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.000
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to not make what your sacrificial,</v>

6
00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:12.140
<v Speaker 1>whether you want to be or not.</v>

7
00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.450
<v Speaker 1>That's a good thing to know as well.</v>

8
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.040
<v Speaker 1>So even though it's rather,</v>

9
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.701
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:16.701 --> 00:00:17.990
<v Speaker 1>it's rough thing to figure out,</v>

11
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.450
<v Speaker 1>but other questions</v>

12
00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:30.603
<v Speaker 2>I haven't had no one else.</v>

13
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:31.330
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

14
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.820
<v Speaker 1>Nothing you just said about noticing and more and more and people live into</v>

15
00:00:33.821 --> 00:00:34.654
<v Speaker 1>their 20s yeah.</v>

16
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.040
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about that?</v>

17
00:00:37.041 --> 00:00:40.010
<v Speaker 2>Where do you think that comes from in terms of culture?</v>

18
00:00:40.011 --> 00:00:40.844
<v Speaker 2>We live in,</v>

19
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.790
<v Speaker 1>think universities facilitated</v>

20
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.000
<v Speaker 1>because you can go to university to not be something instead of going to</v>

21
00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:50.290
<v Speaker 1>university to be something and,</v>

22
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.180
<v Speaker 1>and that's it's pleasure island</v>

23
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.600
<v Speaker 1>and the price you pay for it,</v>

24
00:00:55.601 --> 00:00:59.680
<v Speaker 1>especially in the u s is debt and you're enticed into it because the</v>

25
00:00:59.681 --> 00:01:01.180
<v Speaker 1>administrators can pick your pocket.</v>

26
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.110
<v Speaker 1>So they rob your future self while allowing you to pretend that you have an</v>

27
00:01:07.301 --> 00:01:08.134
<v Speaker 1>identity.</v>

28
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:09.430
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

29
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:10.420
<v Speaker 1>Very nasty.</v>

30
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.110
<v Speaker 1>And you can't declare bankruptcy with your student loans in the U S it's</v>

31
00:01:14.111 --> 00:01:16.540
<v Speaker 1>indentured servitude and it,</v>

32
00:01:16.541 --> 00:01:17.080
<v Speaker 1>it is player.</v>

33
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.400
<v Speaker 1>It's precisely pleasure island.</v>

34
00:01:18.401 --> 00:01:19.330
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly that.</v>

35
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.690
<v Speaker 1>And so tuition fees of short way out of control.</v>

36
00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.870
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason that universities don't make more demands on their</v>

37
00:01:25.871 --> 00:01:28.750
<v Speaker 1>students and let them get away with all the things,</v>

38
00:01:28.751 --> 00:01:31.090
<v Speaker 1>they let them get away with this because they're basically,</v>

39
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.710
<v Speaker 1>why the hell would you chase them out?</v>

40
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.250
<v Speaker 1>There are $100,000 or more so they can do whatever they want as long as you get</v>

41
00:01:40.721 --> 00:01:42.160
<v Speaker 1>to sell them to the salt mines.</v>

42
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.073
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

43
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.671
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

44
00:01:45.671 --> 00:01:46.211
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

45
00:01:46.211 --> 00:01:49.210
<v Speaker 1>it's not the only reason because the other thing that's happened is that the</v>

46
00:01:49.211 --> 00:01:52.990
<v Speaker 1>rate of technological transformation is so fast now and the rate of turnover of</v>

47
00:01:52.991 --> 00:01:53.824
<v Speaker 1>things is that it's,</v>

48
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.100
<v Speaker 1>it is genuinely harder for people who are say 18 to 20 when I was a kid,</v>

49
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.221
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

50
00:02:00.221 --> 00:02:01.690
<v Speaker 1>the kind of rough patch for,</v>

51
00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.770
<v Speaker 1>for for life was probably 14 to 17 something like that.</v>

52
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.700
<v Speaker 1>Now it's,</v>

53
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.640
<v Speaker 1>I think it's 18 to 25 something like that.</v>

54
00:02:09.641 --> 00:02:11.070
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reason for that is,</v>

55
00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:15.970
<v Speaker 1>is that all the jobs that the bloody hippies complained about being doomed to in</v>

56
00:02:15.971 --> 00:02:17.830
<v Speaker 1>the 1960s have now disappeared.</v>

57
00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:18.760
<v Speaker 1>Their problem was,</v>

58
00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:19.511
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

59
00:02:19.511 --> 00:02:19.901
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be,</v>

60
00:02:19.901 --> 00:02:23.920
<v Speaker 1>I go have to work for a corporation and get a salary for the rest of my life,</v>

61
00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.461
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

62
00:02:24.461 --> 00:02:28.060
<v Speaker 1>and then I'll just end up with a pension and that'll be my whole life.</v>

63
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.691
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

64
00:02:28.691 --> 00:02:29.020
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

65
00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.020
<v Speaker 1>it seems like a lot better deal then an endless round of part time Starbucks</v>

66
00:02:34.591 --> 00:02:35.424
<v Speaker 1>jobs.</v>

67
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.410
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

68
00:02:37.411 --> 00:02:39.240
<v Speaker 1>some of it is that it's,</v>

69
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:40.330
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

70
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.700
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

71
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.200
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

72
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.200
<v Speaker 1>there's a space now in our culture that that is lacking for people to make that</v>

73
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.670
<v Speaker 1>transformation from,</v>

74
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.650
<v Speaker 1>from adolescence into adulthood.</v>

75
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:51.783
<v Speaker 1>And so it's just,</v>

76
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.600
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

77
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.870
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

78
00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.680
<v Speaker 1>the cost of that is for stalled,</v>

79
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:55.930
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a good thing.</v>

80
00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:58.420
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good thing.</v>

81
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.300
<v Speaker 2>Do you think this is affecting employers picky and choosy younger people for a</v>

82
00:03:04.301 --> 00:03:04.560
<v Speaker 2>job?</v>

83
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.361
<v Speaker 2>Are you saying that the,</v>

84
00:03:05.361 --> 00:03:09.220
<v Speaker 2>they're seeing this Laura maturation or this or saying this person's got a</v>

85
00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:10.200
<v Speaker 2>degree from UFT,</v>

86
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.010
<v Speaker 2>but I've heard about things like degrees out worth birthday.</v>

87
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:14.101
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

88
00:03:14.101 --> 00:03:14.340
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

89
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.280
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple of problems with the degrees is that everyone has one.</v>

90
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.360
<v Speaker 1>That's the first one,</v>

91
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.700
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

92
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.930
<v Speaker 1>so because scarcity matters obviously.</v>

93
00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.353
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

94
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:24.630
<v Speaker 1>the second thing is,</v>

95
00:03:24.631 --> 00:03:28.380
<v Speaker 1>is that the match between the degree in the workplace has become less and less</v>

96
00:03:28.381 --> 00:03:29.220
<v Speaker 1>self evident.</v>

97
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.910
<v Speaker 1>You know what should happen when you go to university is you should learn how to</v>

98
00:03:32.911 --> 00:03:34.860
<v Speaker 1>think and formulate arguments.</v>

99
00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.000
<v Speaker 1>You should learn to think,</v>

100
00:03:36.001 --> 00:03:37.260
<v Speaker 1>speak and write.</v>

101
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.880
<v Speaker 1>That's what the humanities are for.</v>

102
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.890
<v Speaker 1>They're to make you dangerous,</v>

103
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

104
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.350
<v Speaker 1>Because if you can think and speak and write your deadly in a complex job,</v>

105
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.880
<v Speaker 1>you're exactly what's necessary.</v>

106
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.170
<v Speaker 1>But if you don't have that,</v>

107
00:03:49.171 --> 00:03:50.610
<v Speaker 1>it's like what the hell good is the degree.</v>

108
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.260
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>

109
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.200
<v Speaker 1>degree in English literature doesn't prepare you for a job.</v>

110
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.120
<v Speaker 1>It could make you think,</v>

111
00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.470
<v Speaker 1>write and speak,</v>

112
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.690
<v Speaker 1>which prepares you for any complex job.</v>

113
00:04:00.691 --> 00:04:01.830
<v Speaker 1>And that's what's supposed to happen.</v>

114
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.290
<v Speaker 1>But increasingly I think,</v>

115
00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:05.150
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

116
00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.983
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't happen.</v>

117
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.220
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

118
00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.040
<v Speaker 1>And the employers are waking up to this very rapidly,</v>

119
00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:11.630
<v Speaker 1>so and there,</v>

120
00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.901
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

121
00:04:11.901 --> 00:04:14.300
<v Speaker 1>they've already known that most for most complex positions,</v>

122
00:04:14.301 --> 00:04:15.590
<v Speaker 1>they have to train their people.</v>

123
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.121
<v Speaker 1>Now they're thinking,</v>

124
00:04:17.121 --> 00:04:17.301
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

125
00:04:17.301 --> 00:04:19.760
<v Speaker 1>why do I have to bother with the degree if I'm going to train them?</v>

126
00:04:19.761 --> 00:04:21.350
<v Speaker 1>If it isn't bringing anything of value?</v>

127
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:22.071
<v Speaker 1>You see this.</v>

128
00:04:22.071 --> 00:04:23.450
<v Speaker 1>And even it feels like law.</v>

129
00:04:23.451 --> 00:04:26.300
<v Speaker 1>When I went to do a debate at Queen's university three weeks ago,</v>

130
00:04:26.301 --> 00:04:28.430
<v Speaker 1>I think they couldn't get anybody to debate me.</v>

131
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.631
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

132
00:04:29.631 --> 00:04:29.811
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

133
00:04:29.811 --> 00:04:30.561
<v Speaker 1>the guy had to pay,</v>

134
00:04:30.561 --> 00:04:31.700
<v Speaker 1>play devil's advocate.</v>

135
00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.350
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about bill see 16.</v>

136
00:04:33.351 --> 00:04:33.681
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

137
00:04:33.681 --> 00:04:34.071
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

138
00:04:34.071 --> 00:04:34.940
<v Speaker 1>that's so pathetic.</v>

139
00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about legal matters.</v>

140
00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.710
<v Speaker 1>And I meant the word greatest didn't one of the greatest universities in the</v>

141
00:04:39.711 --> 00:04:40.430
<v Speaker 1>West,</v>

142
00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:41.031
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

143
00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:42.500
<v Speaker 1>It's in the top 200,</v>

144
00:04:42.501 --> 00:04:43.334
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

145
00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:44.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

146
00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.350
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't get someone to argue with the stupid psychology professor about law,</v>

147
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.660
<v Speaker 1>had to get a devil's advocate.</v>

148
00:04:50.661 --> 00:04:53.990
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that was really disheartening talking to the students</v>

149
00:04:53.991 --> 00:04:56.600
<v Speaker 1>was they told me four or five of them,</v>

150
00:04:56.601 --> 00:04:59.990
<v Speaker 1>they're not learning a damn thing and lights all social justice nonsense.</v>

151
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:01.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

152
00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:02.480
<v Speaker 1>well good,</v>

153
00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:03.560
<v Speaker 1>that'll do it in the profession.</v>

154
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.890
<v Speaker 1>It's being done in any ways because lawyers being replaced by automation.</v>

155
00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.100
<v Speaker 1>And so a lot of what they do is dig up information.</v>

156
00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.461
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

157
00:05:10.461 --> 00:05:10.791
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

158
00:05:10.791 --> 00:05:11.960
<v Speaker 1>you can do that on your own.</v>

159
00:05:11.961 --> 00:05:14.540
<v Speaker 1>And forums are proliferating like mad.</v>

160
00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.840
<v Speaker 1>So the law school should be teaching you to be a monster.</v>

161
00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:20.520
<v Speaker 1>You better be,</v>

162
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:22.830
<v Speaker 1>but you come out,</v>

163
00:05:22.831 --> 00:05:24.690
<v Speaker 1>you're concerned with social welfare.</v>

164
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.553
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

165
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

166
00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.941
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

167
00:05:26.941 --> 00:05:28.290
<v Speaker 1>there's just nothing to that.</v>

168
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can come out and say you're,</v>

169
00:05:30.691 --> 00:05:32.100
<v Speaker 1>you want to be nice to people.</v>

170
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

171
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.361
<v Speaker 1>that's nice.</v>

172
00:05:33.361 --> 00:05:33.630
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

173
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:34.411
<v Speaker 1>You go right ahead.</v>

174
00:05:34.411 --> 00:05:34.681
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

175
00:05:34.681 --> 00:05:37.830
<v Speaker 1>I'll go find someone who can do something and you can go be nice to people and</v>

176
00:05:37.831 --> 00:05:40.230
<v Speaker 1>see how effective that is.</v>

177
00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.700
<v Speaker 1>So it's a lot of things that are conspiring in the same direction.</v>

178
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.520
<v Speaker 1>People don't have to get married to have sex,</v>

179
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.250
<v Speaker 1>so we have no idea what that's going to do.</v>

180
00:05:51.251 --> 00:05:54.220
<v Speaker 1>Although we know one thing it's done is the only people to get married now,</v>

181
00:05:54.221 --> 00:05:55.054
<v Speaker 1>or rich.</v>

182
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:56.190
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

183
00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:56.491
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

184
00:05:56.491 --> 00:06:00.410
<v Speaker 1>Which is another thing that's really comical because the feminist id in the 60s</v>

185
00:06:00.411 --> 00:06:01.940
<v Speaker 1>was that marriage was an oppressive,</v>

186
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.781
<v Speaker 1>oppressive,</v>

187
00:06:02.781 --> 00:06:03.950
<v Speaker 1>patriarchal institution.</v>

188
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.311
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

189
00:06:04.311 --> 00:06:04.641
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

190
00:06:04.641 --> 00:06:07.730
<v Speaker 1>fine then why do only rich women get married now?</v>

191
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:09.111
<v Speaker 1>Because that's the,</v>

192
00:06:09.111 --> 00:06:10.160
<v Speaker 1>that is the case.</v>

193
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.020
<v Speaker 1>And so for poorer women,</v>

194
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.440
<v Speaker 1>the dissolution of marriage has been an absolute catastrophe.</v>

195
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.710
<v Speaker 1>They are so screwed because they have kids.</v>

196
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.390
<v Speaker 1>So they're working,</v>

197
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.310
<v Speaker 1>they've got their 90 hour work week,</v>

198
00:06:22.311 --> 00:06:22.611
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

199
00:06:22.611 --> 00:06:23.444
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

200
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.880
<v Speaker 1>They're much less attractive to potential mates.</v>

201
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:27.800
<v Speaker 1>So they get low quality men,</v>

202
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:29.900
<v Speaker 1>often parasitical and predatory.</v>

203
00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.880
<v Speaker 1>So they often have like jobs in retail for example,</v>

204
00:06:34.881 --> 00:06:35.870
<v Speaker 1>which are just dreadful.</v>

205
00:06:35.871 --> 00:06:37.550
<v Speaker 1>You don't even know what your schedule is going to be.</v>

206
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:39.350
<v Speaker 1>You get paid hardly anything.</v>

207
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:40.041
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

208
00:06:40.041 --> 00:06:40.874
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>

209
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:42.831
<v Speaker 1>but if you know,</v>

210
00:06:42.831 --> 00:06:43.820
<v Speaker 1>most of the women who,</v>

211
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.690
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

212
00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:49.690
<v Speaker 1>who are outspoken feminists are on the successful end of the socioeconomic</v>

213
00:06:51.621 --> 00:06:52.460
<v Speaker 1>distribution.</v>

214
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.500
<v Speaker 1>They're university students or people like that.</v>

215
00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:56.330
<v Speaker 1>They don't even know any poor women.</v>

216
00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.570
<v Speaker 1>So they have no idea what their lives are like.</v>

217
00:06:59.571 --> 00:07:00.620
<v Speaker 1>And you would never know,</v>

218
00:07:00.621 --> 00:07:02.000
<v Speaker 1>cause they're at home working,</v>

219
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:02.863
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

220
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.900
<v Speaker 1>they're either at their horrible job or they're at home slaving away with their</v>

221
00:07:05.901 --> 00:07:06.530
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>

222
00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:08.870
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like they're out there telling you what's wrong with them.</v>
