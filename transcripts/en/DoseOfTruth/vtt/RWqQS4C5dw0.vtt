1
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:07.343
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.590
<v Speaker 1>Society as a whole.</v>

3
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.520
<v Speaker 1>Then you're looking at it from the wrong perspective.</v>

4
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.450
<v Speaker 1>Your,</v>

5
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.830
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

6
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.520
<v Speaker 1>your level of analysis is wrong.</v>

7
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.480
<v Speaker 1>So you know it is society as a whole,</v>

8
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.490
<v Speaker 1>but what the hell good is that going to do you,</v>

9
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.470
<v Speaker 1>you can't complain to society as a whole.</v>

10
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.710
<v Speaker 1>You have to look for the micro manifestations that actually occur in your realm</v>

11
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:34.800
<v Speaker 1>and work on those.</v>

12
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah and that's the only level of analysis you have any control over anyways.</v>

13
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.540
<v Speaker 1>Fix the things that are within your realm of power and what will happen as a</v>

14
00:00:43.541 --> 00:00:46.330
<v Speaker 1>consequence of that is that your realm of power will grow,</v>

15
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.090
<v Speaker 1>but you start local because like what the hell do you know?</v>

16
00:00:49.091 --> 00:00:51.010
<v Speaker 1>You're 19 or 20 or whatever it is.</v>

17
00:00:51.011 --> 00:00:51.840
<v Speaker 1>Like you have,</v>

18
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.470
<v Speaker 1>you have a scrap with society.</v>

19
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's just an architectural problem.</v>

20
00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.010
<v Speaker 1>That's all it is.</v>

21
00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.830
<v Speaker 1>Because you don't know enough about society to have that opinion.</v>

22
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:00.941
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

23
00:01:00.941 --> 00:01:01.721
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not being,</v>

24
00:01:01.721 --> 00:01:05.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm not being a like I'm not trying to be cynical about this.</v>

25
00:01:05.681 --> 00:01:07.690
<v Speaker 1>I am telling you it's an architectural problem,</v>

26
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.261
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

27
00:01:08.261 --> 00:01:08.681
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

28
00:01:08.681 --> 00:01:10.720
<v Speaker 1>everybody who is young has a problem with society.</v>

29
00:01:10.721 --> 00:01:14.170
<v Speaker 1>You're all at the bottom of the bloody dominance hierarchy unless you count the</v>

30
00:01:14.171 --> 00:01:15.730
<v Speaker 1>entire rest of the world,</v>

31
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.090
<v Speaker 1>in which case you're already in the top 1%.</v>

32
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:20.141
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

33
00:01:20.141 --> 00:01:20.681
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

34
00:01:20.681 --> 00:01:22.000
<v Speaker 1>that's where thinking about too.</v>

35
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.601
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

36
00:01:22.601 --> 00:01:23.770
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

37
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.251
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

38
00:01:24.251 --> 00:01:27.310
<v Speaker 1>if you are in involved in a battle,</v>

39
00:01:27.311 --> 00:01:28.720
<v Speaker 1>in some sense with society,</v>

40
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.590
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

41
00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.990
<v Speaker 1>you're dominated by the figure of the great father,</v>

42
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:33.910
<v Speaker 1>the negative figure of the great father.</v>

43
00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.040
<v Speaker 1>You also have to a lot of what you should do about that.</v>

44
00:01:37.041 --> 00:01:38.680
<v Speaker 1>It's increased your level of gratitude.</v>

45
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:40.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

46
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.840
<v Speaker 1>here you are,</v>

47
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.973
<v Speaker 1>it's warm,</v>

48
00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.240
<v Speaker 1>the chair works.</v>

49
00:01:43.241 --> 00:01:44.650
<v Speaker 1>The floor isn't going to fall apart,</v>

50
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:45.221
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

51
00:01:45.221 --> 00:01:46.840
<v Speaker 1>You're at a prestigious institution,</v>

52
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.100
<v Speaker 1>you're well on your way to being one of the top 1% in society.</v>

53
00:01:51.101 --> 00:01:53.320
<v Speaker 1>You're just too damn young right now for that to happen.</v>

54
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.333
<v Speaker 1>You're smart,</v>

55
00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.413
<v Speaker 1>you're healthy,</v>

56
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.500
<v Speaker 1>you're good looking,</v>

57
00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.720
<v Speaker 1>except for that weird thing you're wearing around your head.</v>

58
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.871
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

59
00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:03.430
<v Speaker 1>you know what the hell,</v>

60
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:04.091
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

61
00:02:04.091 --> 00:02:05.260
<v Speaker 1>everything's good for you.</v>

62
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.530
<v Speaker 1>So I'm,</v>

63
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.911
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

64
00:02:06.911 --> 00:02:09.610
<v Speaker 1>I know there's a tyrannical element there is,</v>

65
00:02:09.611 --> 00:02:10.444
<v Speaker 1>it's real.</v>

66
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.153
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

67
00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.320
<v Speaker 1>but if that's all you see,</v>

68
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:15.011
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

69
00:02:15.011 --> 00:02:16.930
<v Speaker 1>you're blinded and that's not good.</v>

70
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.710
<v Speaker 1>It'll warp you.</v>
