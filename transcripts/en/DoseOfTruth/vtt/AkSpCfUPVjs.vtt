<v Speaker 1>Atomic carlos says,</v>

2
00:00:07.891 --> 00:00:11.670
<v Speaker 1>my Iq is north of one 30 yet I questioned my own intelligence all the time.</v>

3
00:00:11.671 --> 00:00:15.750
<v Speaker 1>I feel big cognitive dissonance between what people expect of me and what I</v>

4
00:00:15.751 --> 00:00:17.820
<v Speaker 1>considered myself capable to do.</v>

5
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:18.863
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.130
<v Speaker 1>you know Carlos would,</v>

7
00:00:20.131 --> 00:00:22.050
<v Speaker 1>I would recommend there is that if,</v>

8
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.220
<v Speaker 1>if you haven't done it,</v>

9
00:00:23.221 --> 00:00:27.390
<v Speaker 1>just go do the personality test and understand myself.com because what you're</v>

10
00:00:27.391 --> 00:00:32.391
<v Speaker 1>describing sounds very much like high levels of negative emotionality or</v>

11
00:00:32.641 --> 00:00:33.474
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism.</v>

12
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.640
<v Speaker 1>And you might want to find out if that's the case,</v>

13
00:00:35.641 --> 00:00:39.630
<v Speaker 1>because if you're much higher than average in neuroticism,</v>

14
00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:42.240
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to be questioning yourself all the time.</v>

15
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.740
<v Speaker 1>And you might want to figure out if that's actually a trait and if it is a trait</v>

16
00:00:46.741 --> 00:00:48.600
<v Speaker 1>while then that gives you an explanation of it.</v>

17
00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:53.601
<v Speaker 1>And then you might also know that your levels of negative emotion are not well</v>

18
00:00:53.761 --> 00:00:55.770
<v Speaker 1>matched to your likely scale.</v>

19
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.580
<v Speaker 1>Now that doesn't necessarily help you learn to cope with it,</v>

20
00:00:59.581 --> 00:01:04.020
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes identifying the reason it's useful and there's another possibility</v>

21
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.020
<v Speaker 1>too is that your mood is dysregulated and that you're depressed.</v>

22
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.940
<v Speaker 1>So that's another thing to consider.</v>

23
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.283
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

24
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.393
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

25
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.880
<v Speaker 1>if you do find that you have high levels of neuroticism but you're not</v>

26
00:01:14.881 --> 00:01:15.391
<v Speaker 1>depressed,</v>

27
00:01:15.391 --> 00:01:18.960
<v Speaker 1>then one of the things you might do is write down all the reasons,</v>

28
00:01:18.961 --> 00:01:20.370
<v Speaker 1>like really think them out.</v>

29
00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:21.090
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

30
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.860
<v Speaker 1>Really get serious about this.</v>

31
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.940
<v Speaker 1>Write down all the reasons why you might give yourself more credit for</v>

32
00:01:26.941 --> 00:01:28.500
<v Speaker 1>intelligence than you have.</v>

33
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.780
<v Speaker 1>And part of that could be like a really deep reconsideration of successes you've</v>

34
00:01:33.781 --> 00:01:37.020
<v Speaker 1>had in the past with complex intellectual issues.</v>

35
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

36
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.730
<v Speaker 1>because imagine that you are serving as your own defense attorney against a very</v>

37
00:01:41.731 --> 00:01:45.410
<v Speaker 1>critical part of your mind that can help locked,</v>

38
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.320
<v Speaker 1>that can help.</v>
