1
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.940
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

2
00:00:07.941 --> 00:00:11.080
<v Speaker 1>so there's Horace and then there's the guy on the,</v>

3
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.670
<v Speaker 1>on the right there is set and he's like the precursor of the Christian</v>

4
00:00:15.671 --> 00:00:17.050
<v Speaker 1>representation of Satan.</v>

5
00:00:17.051 --> 00:00:17.531
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

6
00:00:17.531 --> 00:00:22.531
<v Speaker 1>the named Satan seems to have been at transformation of the name sat and Psat is</v>

7
00:00:22.661 --> 00:00:23.494
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

8
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.500
<v Speaker 1>he's like the God of totalitarian possibility because in Egypt in mythology he</v>

9
00:00:28.931 --> 00:00:30.430
<v Speaker 1>represents the brother,</v>

10
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.780
<v Speaker 1>the evil brother of the rightful king who's always plotting to overthrow the</v>

11
00:00:34.781 --> 00:00:35.614
<v Speaker 1>rightful king.</v>

12
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.660
<v Speaker 1>And Horace is his natural enemy.</v>

13
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:38.761
<v Speaker 1>And what this means,</v>

14
00:00:38.761 --> 00:00:39.491
<v Speaker 1>I tell you man,</v>

15
00:00:39.491 --> 00:00:40.570
<v Speaker 1>it's really important.</v>

16
00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.770
<v Speaker 1>So I have in my clinical practice frequently people who are stuck in the middle</v>

17
00:00:44.771 --> 00:00:46.720
<v Speaker 1>of absolutely moronic bureaucracy.</v>

18
00:00:46.721 --> 00:00:48.610
<v Speaker 1>So I can give you an example of this.</v>

19
00:00:48.611 --> 00:00:49.540
<v Speaker 1>I just love this.</v>

20
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.450
<v Speaker 1>One of my clients who worked for a large corporation,</v>

21
00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:53.920
<v Speaker 1>who's pretty sensible woman,</v>

22
00:00:53.921 --> 00:00:57.580
<v Speaker 1>she's being driven mad by the political correctness that didn't detected the</v>

23
00:00:57.581 --> 00:00:58.350
<v Speaker 1>organization.</v>

24
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.350
<v Speaker 1>And she sent me at 32 32 email letter exchanges that were circulating around the</v>

25
00:01:06.941 --> 00:01:07.930
<v Speaker 1>word flip chart.</v>

26
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if any of you have heard the flip chart conver controversy,</v>

27
00:01:10.901 --> 00:01:13.420
<v Speaker 1>but it's Kurt pretty mind bogglingly moronic.</v>

28
00:01:13.421 --> 00:01:13.990
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

29
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.870
<v Speaker 1>and so the deal was that somebody,</v>

30
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:17.950
<v Speaker 1>you know what a flip chart is,</v>

31
00:01:17.951 --> 00:01:18.161
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

32
00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:21.370
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those paper pads that you flip the paper over.</v>

33
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.170
<v Speaker 1>Well it turns out hypothetically that flip is a pejorative term for Filipinos.</v>

34
00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.630
<v Speaker 1>And so they believe that the idea,</v>

35
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.310
<v Speaker 1>the flip chart phrase was no longer acceptable because it was potentially</v>

36
00:01:33.311 --> 00:01:34.540
<v Speaker 1>offensive to was,</v>

37
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.110
<v Speaker 1>although I bet they would have had to like vacuum up the whole planet to find</v>

38
00:01:38.111 --> 00:01:42.130
<v Speaker 1>one Filipino who actually cared whether or not someone called that a flip chart,</v>

39
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.821
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

40
00:01:42.821 --> 00:01:45.910
<v Speaker 1>And that person would have had plenty of problems that were worse than that.</v>

41
00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.571
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

42
00:01:46.571 --> 00:01:51.571
<v Speaker 1>there was like a 32 serious email exchanges about what terminology should be</v>

43
00:01:52.211 --> 00:01:54.190
<v Speaker 1>used instead of flip chart,</v>

44
00:01:54.191 --> 00:01:54.460
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

45
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.730
<v Speaker 1>So that's what people were doing instead of trying to actually have a life and</v>

46
00:01:57.731 --> 00:02:00.850
<v Speaker 1>do something useful and it was driving her completely mad.</v>

47
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.800
<v Speaker 1>They did rename them and made it,</v>

48
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.873
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

49
00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.470
<v Speaker 1>it made part of corporate policy that it was inappropriate to use the word flip</v>

50
00:02:08.471 --> 00:02:08.741
<v Speaker 1>chart.</v>

51
00:02:08.741 --> 00:02:10.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what the hell they called them.</v>

52
00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:11.643
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

53
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.933
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

54
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.150
<v Speaker 1>but the reason I'm telling you this story is lot of you are going to find</v>

55
00:02:16.151 --> 00:02:19.690
<v Speaker 1>yourself embedded in bureaucracies and you know,</v>

56
00:02:19.691 --> 00:02:21.160
<v Speaker 1>and there's that for better or for worse.</v>

57
00:02:21.161 --> 00:02:22.330
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that are going to,</v>

58
00:02:22.331 --> 00:02:26.230
<v Speaker 1>is going to happen to you is that people are going to ask you to do stupid and</v>

59
00:02:26.231 --> 00:02:27.430
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous things.</v>

60
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.300
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that they're asking you to do stupid and ridiculous things,</v>

61
00:02:31.301 --> 00:02:32.440
<v Speaker 1>it's going to do two things,</v>

62
00:02:32.441 --> 00:02:33.340
<v Speaker 1>three things to you.</v>

63
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.300
<v Speaker 1>One is it a warp you so that you'll pretend that you agree with it and then</v>

64
00:02:37.301 --> 00:02:38.350
<v Speaker 1>eventually you will,</v>

65
00:02:38.351 --> 00:02:40.960
<v Speaker 1>and like good so much for your soul.</v>

66
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.760
<v Speaker 1>And then the other thing is,</v>

67
00:02:42.761 --> 00:02:44.950
<v Speaker 1>is that it will demotivate you because you'll think,</v>

68
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.050
<v Speaker 1>why should I be like slaving away at this job when you know I'm being pecked to</v>

69
00:02:50.051 --> 00:02:52.360
<v Speaker 1>death by morons with stupid rules.</v>

70
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.070
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

71
00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.750
<v Speaker 1>the third thing that it will do is make you resentful and irritated,</v>

72
00:02:57.751 --> 00:03:01.720
<v Speaker 1>and then that will also undermine motivation and make your life miserable.</v>

73
00:03:01.721 --> 00:03:02.590
<v Speaker 1>And so you might think,</v>

74
00:03:02.591 --> 00:03:02.980
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

75
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.840
<v Speaker 1>what should you do about that?</v>

76
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.960
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is you should object at the earliest possible point</v>

77
00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:11.650
<v Speaker 1>because first of all,</v>

78
00:03:11.651 --> 00:03:12.970
<v Speaker 1>you'll find that if you do,</v>

79
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.610
<v Speaker 1>if you object to radical stupidity,</v>

80
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:16.960
<v Speaker 1>when it first emerges,</v>

81
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.230
<v Speaker 1>you kind of make people aware of the fact that what they're doing is radically</v>

82
00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:22.630
<v Speaker 1>stupid and they'll usually back off.</v>

83
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.060
<v Speaker 1>And so then they won't torture you to death.</v>

84
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.160
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

85
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

86
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.640
<v Speaker 1>you have to take a risk,</v>

87
00:03:27.641 --> 00:03:27.971
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

88
00:03:27.971 --> 00:03:28.391
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

89
00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:30.070
<v Speaker 1>what happens if I complain about this?</v>

90
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.970
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

91
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.910
<v Speaker 1>it's another one of those situations where you're damned if you do and you're</v>

92
00:03:33.911 --> 00:03:34.870
<v Speaker 1>damned if you don't.</v>

93
00:03:34.871 --> 00:03:35.890
<v Speaker 1>So if you complain,</v>

94
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.330
<v Speaker 1>that'll cause some trouble.</v>

95
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.320
<v Speaker 1>Although usually it causes way less trouble than you'd think because people are</v>

96
00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:43.000
<v Speaker 1>generally not very courageous.</v>

97
00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:45.660
<v Speaker 1>And if you push them with some strength on a,</v>

98
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.830
<v Speaker 1>when they're doing something absolutely moronic,</v>

99
00:03:47.831 --> 00:03:50.470
<v Speaker 1>they'll usually back off because they don't know what to do when they're being</v>

100
00:03:50.471 --> 00:03:51.304
<v Speaker 1>challenged.</v>

101
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.010
<v Speaker 1>And then you won't have to put up with it for the rest of your life.</v>

102
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.570
<v Speaker 1>And so why I'm telling you this is because all sorts of bureaucratic,</v>

103
00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.023
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

104
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.903
<v Speaker 1>entities,</v>

105
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.320
<v Speaker 1>corporations,</v>

106
00:04:02.321 --> 00:04:03.760
<v Speaker 1>government institutions,</v>

107
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.833
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

108
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:06.910
<v Speaker 1>nonprofit organizations,</v>

109
00:04:06.911 --> 00:04:09.040
<v Speaker 1>anything that's above a certain size,</v>

110
00:04:09.041 --> 00:04:10.960
<v Speaker 1>cause it doesn't matter if it's government or corporate,</v>

111
00:04:10.961 --> 00:04:12.370
<v Speaker 1>it's all the same bloody foolishness.</v>

112
00:04:12.371 --> 00:04:13.330
<v Speaker 1>When it gets too big,</v>

113
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.290
<v Speaker 1>it's like those things can towards totalitarian structures.</v>

114
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.393
<v Speaker 1>It's part of,</v>

115
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.390
<v Speaker 1>it's part of their,</v>

116
00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:22.510
<v Speaker 1>the innate danger that's associated with social organization.</v>

117
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.620
<v Speaker 1>And so then you might say,</v>

118
00:04:23.621 --> 00:04:28.621
<v Speaker 1>well how do you keep the enterprise that you're part of alive and dynamic and</v>

119
00:04:29.201 --> 00:04:32.200
<v Speaker 1>also keep it a place that a sensible person who's got,</v>

120
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.680
<v Speaker 1>who's got a proper orientation could stand to work.</v>

121
00:04:35.681 --> 00:04:38.140
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is do not do things.</v>

122
00:04:38.141 --> 00:04:38.531
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

123
00:04:38.531 --> 00:04:39.460
<v Speaker 1>to be stupid.</v>

124
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:40.990
<v Speaker 1>Stand up and say,</v>

125
00:04:40.991 --> 00:04:41.291
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

126
00:04:41.291 --> 00:04:41.831
<v Speaker 1>that's dumb.</v>

127
00:04:41.831 --> 00:04:42.581
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing it.</v>

128
00:04:42.581 --> 00:04:43.630
<v Speaker 1>And if they ask you why,</v>

129
00:04:43.631 --> 00:04:44.464
<v Speaker 1>then you can say,</v>

130
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.890
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

131
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:45.161
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

132
00:04:45.161 --> 00:04:46.780
<v Speaker 1>I think it's stupid B,</v>

133
00:04:46.781 --> 00:04:47.381
<v Speaker 1>if I do it,</v>

134
00:04:47.381 --> 00:04:49.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get irritated and resentful.</v>

135
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.410
<v Speaker 1>And also if I do it,</v>

136
00:04:50.411 --> 00:04:53.290
<v Speaker 1>it's going to decrease my motivation so I'm not doing it.</v>

137
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:54.940
<v Speaker 1>And then if they push you too hard,</v>

138
00:04:54.941 --> 00:04:55.450
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

139
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:56.050
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

140
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.820
<v Speaker 1>it's time for a different job.</v>

141
00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.790
<v Speaker 1>And that might be the best thing that ever happened to you because if the,</v>

142
00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.260
<v Speaker 1>the structure you're in is going in that direction and you can't stop it,</v>

143
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.900
<v Speaker 1>it's like get the hell out of there and find something else.</v>

144
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.590
<v Speaker 1>So it's not that hard to find a job when you already have a job.</v>

145
00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.780
<v Speaker 1>Now it's another thing to keep in mind too,</v>

146
00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.321
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

147
00:05:14.321 --> 00:05:16.270
<v Speaker 1>when ever you're working and you will be,</v>

148
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.770
<v Speaker 1>especially in the world that the world of today where jobs are relatively</v>

149
00:05:20.771 --> 00:05:25.360
<v Speaker 1>uncertain is you should always have an escape route plant and it should be</v>

150
00:05:25.361 --> 00:05:29.890
<v Speaker 1>active because if you don't have an escape route and you can't get away,</v>

151
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.330
<v Speaker 1>you can't say no.</v>

152
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:32.980
<v Speaker 1>And if you can't say no,</v>

153
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.120
<v Speaker 1>you can't bargain.</v>

154
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.560
<v Speaker 1>And if you can't bargain,</v>

155
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.700
<v Speaker 1>you're a slave.</v>

156
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.500
<v Speaker 1>So those,</v>

157
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:39.190
<v Speaker 1>that's how it,</v>

158
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.630
<v Speaker 1>that's how the world is set out at the moment.</v>

159
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:42.820
<v Speaker 1>Probably always been like that.</v>

160
00:05:42.821 --> 00:05:46.090
<v Speaker 1>But it's something that you really need to know cause you got to watch if</v>

161
00:05:46.091 --> 00:05:46.540
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

162
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:51.520
<v Speaker 1>if you're being is objecting to someone to something that someone is forcing you</v>

163
00:05:51.521 --> 00:05:52.354
<v Speaker 1>to do,</v>

164
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.040
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're right,</v>

165
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.170
<v Speaker 1>maybe you shouldn't be doing it.</v>

166
00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:00.220
<v Speaker 1>And lots of people end up living meaningless lives and that that's,</v>

167
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.860
<v Speaker 1>that's not a very good term because there's no such thing as a meaningless life</v>

168
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:09.170
<v Speaker 1>because one of the meanings of life is suffering and there's no bloody way</v>

169
00:06:09.171 --> 00:06:10.160
<v Speaker 1>you're going to escape that.</v>

170
00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:12.140
<v Speaker 1>So you will not have a meaningless life.</v>

171
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.690
<v Speaker 1>You'll have a life that's only suffering.</v>

172
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.430
<v Speaker 1>And I wouldn't recommend that because it'll make you one miserable creature and</v>

173
00:06:19.431 --> 00:06:22.430
<v Speaker 1>plus you warp everyone around you because you'll be vengeful.</v>

174
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:23.441
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>

175
00:06:23.441 --> 00:06:24.860
<v Speaker 1>these things are really important.</v>

176
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:25.940
<v Speaker 1>They're really important.</v>
