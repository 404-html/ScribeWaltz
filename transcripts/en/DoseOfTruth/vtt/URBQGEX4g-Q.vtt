1
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.480
<v Speaker 1>So that's the basic narrative I was here and I'm trying to go there and so if</v>

2
00:00:12.131 --> 00:00:15.940
<v Speaker 1>you're asking your kindergarten kid what they did today at school and teaching</v>

3
00:00:15.941 --> 00:00:16.810
<v Speaker 1>them to tell a story,</v>

4
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.561
<v Speaker 1>they might say,</v>

5
00:00:17.561 --> 00:00:20.980
<v Speaker 1>well I was at home and then mom took me to kindergarten.</v>

6
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like not a very exciting story but it's a story and then a little more</v>

7
00:00:24.431 --> 00:00:25.630
<v Speaker 1>exciting story might be</v>

8
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.941
<v Speaker 1>I was at home,</v>

9
00:00:27.941 --> 00:00:31.780
<v Speaker 1>my mom took me to school and on the way there are big dog ran up to the fence</v>

10
00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:36.781
<v Speaker 1>and barked at me and the right question that would follow that story is,</v>

11
00:00:36.791 --> 00:00:37.151
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

12
00:00:37.151 --> 00:00:38.320
<v Speaker 1>what did you do?</v>

13
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.630
<v Speaker 1>And that's a real story because the kid says,</v>

14
00:00:40.631 --> 00:00:40.991
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>

15
00:00:40.991 --> 00:00:45.991
<v Speaker 1>I was in this frame of reference and I was aiming at goal a B actually I was</v>

16
00:00:46.511 --> 00:00:51.490
<v Speaker 1>aiming at point B and while I was aiming at point B an acting out the processes</v>

17
00:00:51.491 --> 00:00:52.324
<v Speaker 1>that would lead me there,</v>

18
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.670
<v Speaker 1>something unexpected happened.</v>

19
00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:56.530
<v Speaker 1>That's a story.</v>

20
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:57.341
<v Speaker 1>And then you say,</v>

21
00:00:57.341 --> 00:00:58.510
<v Speaker 1>well what did you do?</v>

22
00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:59.501
<v Speaker 1>And the kid might say,</v>

23
00:00:59.501 --> 00:00:59.711
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

24
00:00:59.711 --> 00:00:59.951
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

25
00:00:59.951 --> 00:01:04.690
<v Speaker 1>I was really scared and I hid behind mum or so that would be one response and we</v>

26
00:01:04.691 --> 00:01:07.240
<v Speaker 1>still went to kindergarten and I was okay,</v>

27
00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.020
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty good,</v>

28
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.770
<v Speaker 1>pretty good.</v>

29
00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:09.850
<v Speaker 1>Or The kid might say,</v>

30
00:01:09.851 --> 00:01:12.910
<v Speaker 1>well I wasn't scared at all because I know that if you stand up to dogs,</v>

31
00:01:12.911 --> 00:01:14.020
<v Speaker 1>they usually leave you alone.</v>

32
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.060
<v Speaker 1>And we went to kindergarten and that was okay.</v>

33
00:01:16.061 --> 00:01:16.631
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

34
00:01:16.631 --> 00:01:21.010
<v Speaker 1>the kid is trained to tell really they're trying to tell a little hero story and</v>

35
00:01:21.011 --> 00:01:24.100
<v Speaker 1>if they're successful in the accounter with the thing that's unknown,</v>

36
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.730
<v Speaker 1>then they triumph as a consequence of their encounter with the unexpected.</v>

37
00:01:27.731 --> 00:01:28.564
<v Speaker 1>And poof,</v>

38
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.150
<v Speaker 1>you know that's successful at a pace.</v>

39
00:01:30.151 --> 00:01:31.300
<v Speaker 1>You Pat them on the head and you say,</v>

40
00:01:31.301 --> 00:01:31.710
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

41
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.543
<v Speaker 1>that's really good.</v>

42
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.200
<v Speaker 1>They kind of smile and you know you're teaching them,</v>

43
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.620
<v Speaker 1>you're teaching them how to comprehend their existence in a narrative structure</v>

44
00:01:41.051 --> 00:01:43.450
<v Speaker 1>and you're also teaching them what that narrative structure should be.</v>

45
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.980
<v Speaker 1>So this is like a Meta narrative and the Meta narrative says you were going from</v>

46
00:01:47.981 --> 00:01:49.210
<v Speaker 1>point a to point B.</v>

47
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.160
<v Speaker 1>That's the oval on that left.</v>

48
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.800
<v Speaker 1>And then something completely bizarre happened.</v>

49
00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.780
<v Speaker 1>Like I was betrayed and then I was in this terrible place for quite a long</v>

50
00:01:58.781 --> 00:01:59.830
<v Speaker 1>period of time,</v>

51
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.120
<v Speaker 1>a chaotic place.</v>

52
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.300
<v Speaker 1>But I learned a bunch and I put myself back together and I'm a wiser person as a</v>

53
00:02:06.551 --> 00:02:08.110
<v Speaker 1>consequence of the encounter,</v>

54
00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:09.813
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

55
00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.320
<v Speaker 1>Everyone knows that story.</v>

56
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.880
<v Speaker 1>And that's paradise.</v>

57
00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.170
<v Speaker 1>Paradise lost,</v>

58
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.580
<v Speaker 1>paradise regained.</v>

59
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.280
<v Speaker 1>It's a cultural meta-narrative and,</v>

60
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.530
<v Speaker 1>and it's a story that every,</v>

61
00:02:20.531 --> 00:02:21.880
<v Speaker 1>like it's a human story.</v>

62
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.590
<v Speaker 1>It's an apocalyptic story.</v>

63
00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.860
<v Speaker 1>That's why everybody's always all apocalyptic about everything,</v>

64
00:02:26.861 --> 00:02:27.280
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

65
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.660
<v Speaker 1>Apocalypse of the week,</v>

66
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.100
<v Speaker 1>we're going to run out of oil,</v>

67
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.420
<v Speaker 1>we're going to run out of gas.</v>

68
00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.040
<v Speaker 1>There's too much carbon dioxide.</v>

69
00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.840
<v Speaker 1>The Chinese are going to take over the world.</v>

70
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.010
<v Speaker 1>We're ruining the Co.</v>

71
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.300
<v Speaker 1>We're ruining the ecology,</v>

72
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.950
<v Speaker 1>the oceans running out of fish.</v>

73
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.431
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

74
00:02:39.431 --> 00:02:40.870
<v Speaker 1>the world is getting too hot.</v>

75
00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.110
<v Speaker 1>It was getting too cold in 1970 when I was about your age.</v>

76
00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.330
<v Speaker 1>It's like apocalypse of the week.</v>

77
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.433
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

78
00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.420
<v Speaker 1>Because things fall apart and because they can fall apart completely and they</v>

79
00:02:52.421 --> 00:02:53.440
<v Speaker 1>often do.</v>

80
00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.520
<v Speaker 1>And so everyone's always on the alert for like the next potential apocalypse.</v>

81
00:02:57.521 --> 00:02:58.510
<v Speaker 1>And it's no wonder,</v>

82
00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:59.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

83
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.090
<v Speaker 1>a permanent characteristic of life that things can radically fall apart.</v>

84
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.481
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

85
00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:07.960
<v Speaker 1>luckily it's a permanent characteristic of life that they can actually also</v>

86
00:03:07.961 --> 00:03:09.610
<v Speaker 1>radically come back together.</v>

87
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.060
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out that whether or not they radically come together,</v>

88
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.290
<v Speaker 1>depends to some degree on how you choose to act when they fall apart.</v>
