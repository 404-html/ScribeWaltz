1
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.410
<v Speaker 1>Why do I know I discussed religious fundamentalism more often and more in depth.</v>

2
00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.490
<v Speaker 1>Many people consider you a religious apologist as a consequence.</v>

3
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.883
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.590
<v Speaker 1>it's okay if people considered me a religious apologist.</v>

5
00:00:20.591 --> 00:00:22.180
<v Speaker 1>I am a religious apologist.</v>

6
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.630
<v Speaker 1>So an apologist is someone who makes an argument for something.</v>

7
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.020
<v Speaker 1>And I'm constantly making arguments for a religious perspective on life or</v>

8
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.920
<v Speaker 1>religious orientation towards life.</v>

9
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:33.903
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

10
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.913
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.240
<v Speaker 1>an orientation that's centered in,</v>

12
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.433
<v Speaker 1>in meaning,</v>

13
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.960
<v Speaker 1>I know orientation that's centered in desire for all things to thrive in so far</v>

14
00:00:44.111 --> 00:00:49.111
<v Speaker 1>is that it's possible desire for people to speak the truth and act out the truth</v>

15
00:00:50.321 --> 00:00:52.150
<v Speaker 1>and act responsibility,</v>

16
00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:53.200
<v Speaker 1>act responsibly,</v>

17
00:00:53.201 --> 00:00:54.034
<v Speaker 1>and all of that.</v>

18
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.260
<v Speaker 1>And I think that there's some something transcendently necessary about all of</v>

19
00:00:59.261 --> 00:00:59.710
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

20
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.660
<v Speaker 1>And I think it is the antidote to hell.</v>

21
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.760
<v Speaker 1>So that that makes me a religious apologist.</v>

22
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:08.620
<v Speaker 1>The fundamentalists,</v>

23
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.970
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>

24
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.270
<v Speaker 1>Which fundamentalists you mean if you mean the Christian fundamentalists?</v>

25
00:01:13.271 --> 00:01:14.104
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

26
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.180
<v Speaker 1>I understand where they're coming from.</v>

27
00:01:16.181 --> 00:01:17.014
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

28
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.600
<v Speaker 1>I think the Christian</v>

29
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.790
<v Speaker 1>Christianity is an ethical framework above all else.</v>

30
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.470
<v Speaker 1>And it's predicated in a story about the way the world is constituted and,</v>

31
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.610
<v Speaker 1>and the story provides the foundation for that ethic and the ethic unites the</v>

32
00:01:37.011 --> 00:01:38.780
<v Speaker 1>community and gives people direction.</v>

33
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.070
<v Speaker 1>This is a big deal.</v>

34
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.301
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

35
00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:42.950
<v Speaker 1>if the story is challenged,</v>

36
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.020
<v Speaker 1>if the foundational stories challenged,</v>

37
00:01:45.021 --> 00:01:48.200
<v Speaker 1>which is certainly what happened as a consequence of the rise of empirical</v>

38
00:01:48.201 --> 00:01:48.711
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>

39
00:01:48.711 --> 00:01:52.550
<v Speaker 1>then the foundation for the ethic starts to,</v>

40
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.013
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

41
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.730
<v Speaker 1>starts to shake and tremble.</v>

42
00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.890
<v Speaker 1>And that threatens the ethic.</v>

43
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.070
<v Speaker 1>But the ethic is what holds people together and gives them direction.</v>

44
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.320
<v Speaker 1>So you can't just lose the ethic.</v>

45
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.310
<v Speaker 1>So the fundamentalist Christians are all short circuited because they know that</v>

46
00:02:08.311 --> 00:02:13.311
<v Speaker 1>there's something to the ethic and they understand that the foundation has been</v>

47
00:02:13.471 --> 00:02:14.304
<v Speaker 1>shaken,</v>

48
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.260
<v Speaker 1>but they don't know what to do about it.</v>

49
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.130
<v Speaker 1>So they insist that the foundation has not been shaken.</v>

50
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.740
<v Speaker 1>And I understand that.</v>

51
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.840
<v Speaker 1>So I think the way out of that is to understand that</v>

52
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.170
<v Speaker 1>the truth that govern ethics and the truths that govern the description of the</v>

53
00:02:34.171 --> 00:02:37.380
<v Speaker 1>world as a material place are not the same.</v>

54
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.580
<v Speaker 1>They're not,</v>

55
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.413
<v Speaker 1>they're not.</v>

56
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.480
<v Speaker 1>They're not of the same kind.</v>

57
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

58
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.040
<v Speaker 1>how they're related.</v>

59
00:02:44.041 --> 00:02:45.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm not exactly sure,</v>

60
00:02:45.151 --> 00:02:47.460
<v Speaker 1>but there's no simple one to one relationships.</v>

61
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.490
<v Speaker 1>You can't describe the world and then immediately extract out in ethic.</v>

62
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.550
<v Speaker 1>It's partly because there are just too many ways of describing the world.</v>

63
00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.701
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

64
00:02:57.701 --> 00:02:58.534
<v Speaker 1>and this is the,</v>

65
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.400
<v Speaker 1>that the fundamental point of difference as far as I can tell between Sam Harris</v>

66
00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:05.680
<v Speaker 1>and I and hopefully what we'll discuss in the summer.</v>

67
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.023
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

68
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.980
<v Speaker 1>so that's the Christian fundamentalists and I don't really see that they're a</v>

69
00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:14.410
<v Speaker 1>particularly threatening group as far as I can tell.</v>

70
00:03:14.411 --> 00:03:18.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are certainly not in the ascendance by any stretch of the</v>

71
00:03:18.311 --> 00:03:19.150
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>

72
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.023
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

73
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.540
<v Speaker 1>they're not involved in any particularly reprehensible political behavior unless</v>

74
00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:26.800
<v Speaker 1>you count conservatism.</v>

75
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.570
<v Speaker 1>And it is by no means obvious that they're even holding their ground in the</v>

76
00:03:33.571 --> 00:03:34.404
<v Speaker 1>culture war.</v>

77
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.940
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not very worried about them.</v>

78
00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:38.203
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

79
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.560
<v Speaker 1>Islamic fundamentalism,</v>

80
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.080
<v Speaker 1>that's a whole different story.</v>

81
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.600
<v Speaker 1>But I don't know enough about it to discuss it intelligently.</v>

82
00:03:48.601 --> 00:03:50.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand Islam.</v>

83
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:51.510
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

84
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:52.343
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

85
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:53.460
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

86
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm concerned about.</v>

87
00:03:55.231 --> 00:03:56.064
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

88
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.010
<v Speaker 1>what would you call compatibility with,</v>

89
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.890
<v Speaker 1>with the Democratic West?</v>

90
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.830
<v Speaker 1>It isn't obvious to me that there are medium to high functioning Muslim</v>

91
00:04:11.141 --> 00:04:12.070
<v Speaker 1>democracies.</v>

92
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.170
<v Speaker 1>I suppose turkeys the closest one,</v>

93
00:04:14.171 --> 00:04:15.820
<v Speaker 1>but Turkey's pretty soon,</v>

94
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.470
<v Speaker 1>pretty shaky at the moment.</v>

95
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.120
<v Speaker 1>I think that the failure to separate church and state,</v>

96
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.900
<v Speaker 1>or even if we don't call it a failure,</v>

97
00:04:25.901 --> 00:04:30.901
<v Speaker 1>the fact that church and state hasn't been technically separated in Islam makes</v>

98
00:04:31.451 --> 00:04:36.451
<v Speaker 1>it difficult to understand how it's possible for Islam and modern western</v>

99
00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:40.030
<v Speaker 1>democratic traditions to coexist.</v>

100
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how that can be,</v>

101
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.570
<v Speaker 1>that gap can be bridged.</v>

102
00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.953
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

103
00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.821
<v Speaker 1>you could say,</v>

104
00:04:45.821 --> 00:04:47.560
<v Speaker 1>well with goodwill and let's,</v>

105
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.330
<v Speaker 1>let's hope that's the case.</v>

106
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:50.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

107
00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.640
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean I don't think that Muslims can live in a modern western</v>

108
00:04:54.641 --> 00:04:55.241
<v Speaker 1>democracy.</v>

109
00:04:55.241 --> 00:04:55.961
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are many,</v>

110
00:04:55.961 --> 00:04:59.530
<v Speaker 1>many kinds of Muslims just like there are many kinds of Jews and Christians.</v>

111
00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:00.790
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

112
00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.310
<v Speaker 1>and then there's the problem of the current proclivity of the extreme end of the</v>

113
00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.110
<v Speaker 1>Muslim fundamentalist world to become,</v>

114
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.900
<v Speaker 1>to be very violent in very many ways.</v>

115
00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.843
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

116
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:19.251
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

117
00:05:19.251 --> 00:05:22.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a great admirer of the Saudis to say the least.</v>

118
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't appreciate their brand of,</v>

119
00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:29.540
<v Speaker 1>of Wahhabi Islam.</v>

120
00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.080
<v Speaker 1>And I don't appreciate their exports of that view with their petro dollars to</v>

121
00:05:35.421 --> 00:05:36.410
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the world.</v>

122
00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.113
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

123
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.870
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's what I have to say about fundamentalists.</v>

124
00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:45.051
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>

125
00:05:45.051 --> 00:05:45.890
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Peterson.</v>

126
00:05:45.891 --> 00:05:47.750
<v Speaker 1>I've been trying to listen to my conscience,</v>

127
00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.210
<v Speaker 1>but I can't tell the difference between fear,</v>

128
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.400
<v Speaker 1>willful blindness or genuine conscience.</v>

129
00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:53.473
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

130
00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.020
<v Speaker 1>the first thing I would say about that is it is quite clear that you are in fact</v>

131
00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.530
<v Speaker 1>to listen to your conscience because that's probably the first thing that you</v>

132
00:06:00.531 --> 00:06:01.364
<v Speaker 1>discover.</v>

133
00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:02.900
<v Speaker 1>So that's a really good question.</v>

134
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:04.423
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

135
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.993
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

136
00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.853
<v Speaker 1>Fear.</v>

137
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:10.611
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

138
00:06:10.611 --> 00:06:13.430
<v Speaker 1>here's the test and you don't want to do this stupidly.</v>

139
00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.650
<v Speaker 1>If you think that you should do something and you think that the reason you</v>

140
00:06:20.651 --> 00:06:23.200
<v Speaker 1>might not be doing it is because you're afraid,</v>

141
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:24.550
<v Speaker 1>then you should do it.</v>

142
00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:26.470
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

143
00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.690
<v Speaker 1>So that way you can find out if it's fear.</v>

144
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:30.761
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

145
00:06:30.761 --> 00:06:31.720
<v Speaker 1>I think your question is,</v>

146
00:06:31.721 --> 00:06:31.841
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

147
00:06:31.841 --> 00:06:35.080
<v Speaker 1>how do I know my conscience isn't just masquerading as fierce saying,</v>

148
00:06:35.081 --> 00:06:35.201
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

149
00:06:35.201 --> 00:06:36.160
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't do that,</v>

150
00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.950
<v Speaker 1>but it's rationalizing the real issue,</v>

151
00:06:38.951 --> 00:06:40.390
<v Speaker 1>which is you're afraid of doing that.</v>

152
00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:41.680
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

153
00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.513
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

154
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.370
<v Speaker 1>here's a reason that you want to tell the truth.</v>

155
00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:46.390
<v Speaker 1>And I parked,</v>

156
00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:49.870
<v Speaker 1>I kind of figured this out when I was looking deeply into the Pinocchio Story.</v>

157
00:06:49.871 --> 00:06:50.051
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

158
00:06:50.051 --> 00:06:53.740
<v Speaker 1>in Pinocchio as Pinocchio strives to become real,</v>

159
00:06:53.741 --> 00:06:54.180
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

160
00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.990
<v Speaker 1>he has a conscience to guide him,</v>

161
00:06:55.991 --> 00:06:57.400
<v Speaker 1>but it's jimminy cricket,</v>

162
00:06:57.401 --> 00:06:58.240
<v Speaker 1>this insect.</v>

163
00:06:58.241 --> 00:07:00.820
<v Speaker 1>But Jimmy hasn't really a very good conscience.</v>

164
00:07:00.821 --> 00:07:02.410
<v Speaker 1>He's a bit dogmatic to begin with.</v>

165
00:07:02.411 --> 00:07:04.060
<v Speaker 1>Dogmatic and inexperienced.</v>

166
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:06.620
<v Speaker 1>And so it's,</v>

167
00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.500
<v Speaker 1>it's not like the conscience is an unerring guide.</v>

168
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like a partner in discovery.</v>

169
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:17.710
<v Speaker 1>And as you move forward in your life and you consult your conscience and you</v>

170
00:07:18.291 --> 00:07:19.124
<v Speaker 1>listen to it,</v>

171
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:22.940
<v Speaker 1>then it gets smarter and so to you.</v>

172
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:25.100
<v Speaker 1>But there's a code of their,</v>

173
00:07:25.101 --> 00:07:29.450
<v Speaker 1>and this is why I've suggested part of the reason why I've suggested so</v>

174
00:07:29.451 --> 00:07:34.220
<v Speaker 1>frequently in my lectures and in my book that people try not to lie.</v>

175
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:35.223
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>

176
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:36.920
<v Speaker 1>there are many systems,</v>

177
00:07:36.921 --> 00:07:38.420
<v Speaker 1>you have many systems within,</v>

178
00:07:38.421 --> 00:07:39.254
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

179
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:40.190
<v Speaker 1>that guide you.</v>

180
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.360
<v Speaker 1>And one of those is your capacity for rational thought.</v>

181
00:07:44.361 --> 00:07:47.810
<v Speaker 1>And then you have a variety of emotional systems and motivational systems and</v>

182
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:49.820
<v Speaker 1>internal dramas and uh,</v>

183
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.800
<v Speaker 1>intuitions and bodily sensations like lots and lots of and senses,</v>

184
00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:57.050
<v Speaker 1>lots of systems that are guiding you.</v>

185
00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:00.380
<v Speaker 1>And many of them operate,</v>

186
00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:01.303
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

187
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:03.560
<v Speaker 1>unconsciously,</v>

188
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:04.820
<v Speaker 1>autonomously,</v>

189
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.010
<v Speaker 1>instinctively,</v>

190
00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:07.911
<v Speaker 1>implicitly,</v>

191
00:08:07.911 --> 00:08:08.744
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>

192
00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:12.020
<v Speaker 1>Now you PR nonetheless,</v>

193
00:08:12.021 --> 00:08:14.750
<v Speaker 1>you programmed them like you feed them content,</v>

194
00:08:14.751 --> 00:08:17.360
<v Speaker 1>let's say just like you feed your body nourishment,</v>

195
00:08:17.361 --> 00:08:22.361
<v Speaker 1>you feed them content and a lot of the content that you feed them pertains</v>

196
00:08:22.371 --> 00:08:26.270
<v Speaker 1>directly to your voluntary thoughts and speech and your actions.</v>

197
00:08:26.271 --> 00:08:29.300
<v Speaker 1>And then if you pathologize those by lying.</v>

198
00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:33.140
<v Speaker 1>So if you say things that you know not to be true or you don't say things that</v>

199
00:08:33.141 --> 00:08:34.820
<v Speaker 1>you know to be true when you need to,</v>

200
00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:36.110
<v Speaker 1>which is more common.</v>

201
00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:41.690
<v Speaker 1>And if you act in ways that you consider that act in ways you considered</v>

202
00:08:41.691 --> 00:08:42.560
<v Speaker 1>reprehensible,</v>

203
00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:47.630
<v Speaker 1>then you pathologize all of those autonomous systems that guide you.</v>

204
00:08:47.631 --> 00:08:49.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're programming them badly,</v>

205
00:08:49.251 --> 00:08:52.480
<v Speaker 1>you're building an AI system inside yourself really in,</v>

206
00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:52.740
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

207
00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:56.460
<v Speaker 1>in some sense that is what you're doing that has very bad,</v>

208
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.230
<v Speaker 1>it's very bad training data.</v>

209
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.710
<v Speaker 1>And so the output it produces will be well,</v>

210
00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:01.950
<v Speaker 1>won't guide you properly.</v>

211
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:07.370
<v Speaker 1>And so you don't want to pathologize your guidance systems.</v>

212
00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:09.840
<v Speaker 1>It's a really bad idea.</v>

213
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:12.060
<v Speaker 1>So that's why you have to not lie.</v>

214
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.990
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that's also why you have to say what you have to say.</v>

215
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:17.400
<v Speaker 1>And you have to say it clearly as well.</v>

216
00:09:17.401 --> 00:09:18.540
<v Speaker 1>And you have to learn how to do that.</v>

217
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.860
<v Speaker 1>So that's one of the ways of getting your conscience straightened out.</v>

218
00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:25.500
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to have a dialogue with your conscience.</v>

219
00:09:25.501 --> 00:09:26.251
<v Speaker 1>And you might ask,</v>

220
00:09:26.251 --> 00:09:26.521
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

221
00:09:26.521 --> 00:09:26.821
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

222
00:09:26.821 --> 00:09:28.380
<v Speaker 1>well what should I do?</v>

223
00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:29.370
<v Speaker 1>Or what should,</v>

224
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:31.440
<v Speaker 1>should I do this or should I not do this?</v>

225
00:09:31.441 --> 00:09:32.490
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you're thinking,</v>

226
00:09:32.491 --> 00:09:33.480
<v Speaker 1>should I not do this?</v>

227
00:09:33.481 --> 00:09:34.650
<v Speaker 1>In the case of a temptation,</v>

228
00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:39.120
<v Speaker 1>maybe you have a chance to develop a new relationship.</v>

229
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:39.421
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

230
00:09:39.421 --> 00:09:40.254
<v Speaker 1>and you're,</v>

231
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:45.470
<v Speaker 1>you're excited about it and apprehensive about it and afraid of it and you don't</v>

232
00:09:45.511 --> 00:09:47.970
<v Speaker 1>know how to sort out all those feelings.</v>

233
00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:51.420
<v Speaker 1>And the first thing is you really have to want to sort them out.</v>

234
00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:55.680
<v Speaker 1>That's why you have to orient yourself to something that's a genuine up.</v>

235
00:09:55.681 --> 00:09:57.540
<v Speaker 1>You know that the star above the horizon,</v>

236
00:09:57.541 --> 00:10:02.430
<v Speaker 1>you have to really want things to be straight and you have to have thought that</v>

237
00:10:02.431 --> 00:10:03.090
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>

238
00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:06.720
<v Speaker 1>And you have to know what it means for things not to be straight.</v>

239
00:10:06.721 --> 00:10:09.990
<v Speaker 1>And really what it means is that you're headed for hell in one way or another.</v>

240
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:12.300
<v Speaker 1>And if you understand that it's enough,</v>

241
00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.190
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's enough to scare you straight,</v>

242
00:10:14.191 --> 00:10:15.450
<v Speaker 1>you really got to think that through.</v>

243
00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:18.540
<v Speaker 1>Then you've got to think about how much better it would be if you aimed up.</v>

244
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:21.660
<v Speaker 1>And that really has to kind of permeate your whole being.</v>

245
00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.210
<v Speaker 1>And so then you're oriented that way.</v>

246
00:10:24.211 --> 00:10:27.180
<v Speaker 1>You're oriented to dop and you're deciding that it's okay to try to tell the</v>

247
00:10:27.181 --> 00:10:31.020
<v Speaker 1>truth and then you can start to rely on this dialogue with your conscience.</v>

248
00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:35.790
<v Speaker 1>But both of you have to learn and you're going to make mistakes along the way.</v>

249
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:37.500
<v Speaker 1>You know that's okay.</v>

250
00:10:37.501 --> 00:10:38.011
<v Speaker 1>You can say,</v>

251
00:10:38.011 --> 00:10:38.161
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

252
00:10:38.161 --> 00:10:40.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try this without being certain that it's right.</v>

253
00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:41.850
<v Speaker 1>You can even say,</v>

254
00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:45.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say this without being certain that it's correct.</v>

255
00:10:45.241 --> 00:10:47.640
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're arguing with your wife or your husband or your,</v>

256
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:48.601
<v Speaker 1>or your sister,</v>

257
00:10:48.601 --> 00:10:49.434
<v Speaker 1>your father,</v>

258
00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:52.080
<v Speaker 1>and you have an idea about what might be going on,</v>

259
00:10:52.081 --> 00:10:52.920
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>

260
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:54.263
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

261
00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:56.970
<v Speaker 1>here's my idea about what's going on.</v>

262
00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:58.343
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

263
00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:01.230
<v Speaker 1>who knows what that idea might be contaminated with,</v>

264
00:11:01.231 --> 00:11:04.560
<v Speaker 1>like maybe I'm putting it forward just because I'm too proud or arrogant or</v>

265
00:11:04.561 --> 00:11:06.420
<v Speaker 1>angry or fearful or whatever.</v>

266
00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.250
<v Speaker 1>That's possible.</v>

267
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:09.870
<v Speaker 1>Let's see if we can figure that out.</v>

268
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:15.500
<v Speaker 1>But you can offer it tentatively and both have added.</v>

269
00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:17.220
<v Speaker 1>That's what you do if it's a hypothesis,</v>

270
00:11:17.221 --> 00:11:17.401
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

271
00:11:17.401 --> 00:11:20.460
<v Speaker 1>You both have at it and see if it's an idea that's worthy of,</v>

272
00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:25.830
<v Speaker 1>of keeping you do that with your conscience and then you were move forward.</v>

273
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:27.900
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

274
00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:31.770
<v Speaker 1>there's a technique in behavioral psychology called psychotherapy called</v>

275
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.060
<v Speaker 1>collaborative empiricism.</v>

276
00:11:33.061 --> 00:11:34.740
<v Speaker 1>So let's say that we,</v>

277
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.770
<v Speaker 1>you and I have been sitting down and we decided that you're going to try</v>

278
00:11:37.771 --> 00:11:39.330
<v Speaker 1>something new this week,</v>

279
00:11:39.331 --> 00:11:42.570
<v Speaker 1>like maybe your agoraphobic and you're having a hard time in a parking lot.</v>

280
00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:45.570
<v Speaker 1>And so getting out of the car and going to the grocery store.</v>

281
00:11:45.571 --> 00:11:46.410
<v Speaker 1>So maybe we say,</v>

282
00:11:46.411 --> 00:11:47.100
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

283
00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:47.311
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

284
00:11:47.311 --> 00:11:50.160
<v Speaker 1>to drive to the grocery store and you're just going to walk halfway to the</v>

285
00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:53.560
<v Speaker 1>halfway from your car to the door.</v>

286
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:57.460
<v Speaker 1>And that's good enough for like do that every second day for a week and then</v>

287
00:11:57.461 --> 00:11:58.780
<v Speaker 1>come back and let's talk about it.</v>

288
00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:00.520
<v Speaker 1>So that's collaborative empiricism,</v>

289
00:12:00.521 --> 00:12:02.080
<v Speaker 1>you're running a little experiment,</v>

290
00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:02.943
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

291
00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:05.230
<v Speaker 1>well your conscience is guiding you towards something.</v>

292
00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:09.580
<v Speaker 1>You take a tentative step in that direction and then you check and see,</v>

293
00:12:09.581 --> 00:12:09.821
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

294
00:12:09.821 --> 00:12:10.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

295
00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:14.530
<v Speaker 1>did what I wanted to have happen ochre as an outcome.</v>

296
00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:18.220
<v Speaker 1>That's the crucial question and that's the crucial question for behavioral</v>

297
00:12:18.221 --> 00:12:18.641
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>

298
00:12:18.641 --> 00:12:18.851
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

299
00:12:18.851 --> 00:12:20.560
<v Speaker 1>That's the pragmatic perspective.</v>

300
00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:25.830
<v Speaker 1>Did what I want to have happen happen as a consequence of my framework of</v>

301
00:12:25.871 --> 00:12:27.460
<v Speaker 1>interpretation and my action.</v>

302
00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:29.740
<v Speaker 1>If the answer is yes,</v>

303
00:12:29.741 --> 00:12:32.410
<v Speaker 1>then I have not invalidated it.</v>

304
00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:33.100
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

305
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:33.430
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

306
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:36.100
<v Speaker 1>that's the pragmatic philosophy in a nutshell and it's,</v>

307
00:12:36.101 --> 00:12:36.701
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

308
00:12:36.701 --> 00:12:37.534
<v Speaker 1>very smart.</v>

309
00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.000
<v Speaker 1>So you have a dialogue with your conscience that never ends,</v>

310
00:12:45.001 --> 00:12:48.150
<v Speaker 1>and hopefully it gets wiser and you get wiser.</v>

311
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:49.943
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

312
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:55.200
<v Speaker 1>that's the dialogue that young talked about between the conscious and the</v>

313
00:12:55.201 --> 00:12:56.040
<v Speaker 1>unconscious,</v>

314
00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:57.143
<v Speaker 1>between your,</v>

315
00:12:58.740 --> 00:12:59.760
<v Speaker 1>your fantasy life,</v>

316
00:12:59.761 --> 00:13:04.470
<v Speaker 1>say the life that sort of underneath you as a conscious being like you're the</v>

317
00:13:04.471 --> 00:13:06.720
<v Speaker 1>life that's part of your biological platform,</v>

318
00:13:06.721 --> 00:13:11.100
<v Speaker 1>the biological platform that somehow miraculously gives rise to your</v>

319
00:13:11.101 --> 00:13:11.940
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

320
00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:13.860
<v Speaker 1>If a dialogue with that,</v>

321
00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:17.250
<v Speaker 1>we're always in dialogue.</v>

322
00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.510
<v Speaker 1>We're always in dialogue,</v>

323
00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:18.990
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

324
00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:19.823
<v Speaker 1>with everything.</v>

325
00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.233
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

326
00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:24.280
<v Speaker 2>pursue that.</v>
