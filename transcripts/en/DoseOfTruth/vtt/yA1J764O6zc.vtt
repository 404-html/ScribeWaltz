00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.120
<v Speaker 1>One of the things you should know is that you actually die into your brain.</v>

2
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.130
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things you might wonder is why is,</v>

3
00:00:08.131 --> 00:00:09.870
<v Speaker 1>why is it the death evolved?</v>

4
00:00:09.871 --> 00:00:09.991
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

5
00:00:09.991 --> 00:00:12.630
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really make that much sense from a Darwinian perspective,</v>

6
00:00:12.631 --> 00:00:12.811
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

7
00:00:12.811 --> 00:00:16.230
<v Speaker 1>Because you'd make the presupposition that if you could just stick around and</v>

8
00:00:16.231 --> 00:00:18.750
<v Speaker 1>farther children safe for 250 years,</v>

9
00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:22.530
<v Speaker 1>you'd be doing a lot better job than the poor SAP who only live to be 30 so why</v>

10
00:00:22.531 --> 00:00:25.650
<v Speaker 1>is it that you only live to be 70 and really your,</v>

11
00:00:25.651 --> 00:00:25.891
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:00:25.891 --> 00:00:27.220
<v Speaker 1>your period of fertility is over,</v>

13
00:00:27.221 --> 00:00:29.850
<v Speaker 1>say by the time you're 40 why would that be?</v>

14
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.680
<v Speaker 1>What's the utility of death?</v>

15
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:33.061
<v Speaker 1>And then you remember,</v>

16
00:00:33.061 --> 00:00:33.894
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

17
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.790
<v Speaker 1>the environment's always changing,</v>

18
00:00:35.791 --> 00:00:36.001
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

19
00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:38.940
<v Speaker 1>In this chaotic manner that's represented by the great mother.</v>

20
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.430
<v Speaker 1>Can you change with it?</v>

21
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.070
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is yes,</v>

22
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.870
<v Speaker 1>but only to a certain point,</v>

23
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.970
<v Speaker 1>which is why as people age,</v>

24
00:00:47.971 --> 00:00:51.570
<v Speaker 1>they stay tend to become more and more alienated from the current culture,</v>

25
00:00:51.571 --> 00:00:51.840
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

26
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:52.500
<v Speaker 1>They've,</v>

27
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.740
<v Speaker 1>they've adopted their position of being say,</v>

28
00:00:55.741 --> 00:00:58.740
<v Speaker 1>which is a word more or less fixed by the time they're 25 or so.</v>

29
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.940
<v Speaker 1>Once their prefrontal cortex matures and then after that the world gets away</v>

30
00:01:02.941 --> 00:01:03.181
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

31
00:01:03.181 --> 00:01:07.080
<v Speaker 1>they don't have enough biological resources left to constantly undergo new</v>

32
00:01:07.081 --> 00:01:09.630
<v Speaker 1>revolutionary neurological processes.</v>

33
00:01:09.631 --> 00:01:11.580
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason is this,</v>

34
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.650
<v Speaker 1>you have more neural connections in your brain when you're first born,</v>

35
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.950
<v Speaker 1>then you do for the rest of your life any other time in your life.</v>

36
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.120
<v Speaker 1>And as you learn when you're an infant and as you learn say over the first two</v>

37
00:01:24.121 --> 00:01:24.840
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

38
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.730
<v Speaker 1>what happens is that there's a plentitude of circuits and they die off leaving</v>

39
00:01:29.731 --> 00:01:31.560
<v Speaker 1>only those circuits that have a function.</v>

40
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.550
<v Speaker 1>And you think about that,</v>

41
00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:34.620
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a quasi Darwinian process.</v>

42
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.000
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is that as you mature and become fixed in your form,</v>

43
00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:39.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:01:39.241 --> 00:01:40.830
<v Speaker 1>to adopt your personality,</v>

45
00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:40.991
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

46
00:01:40.991 --> 00:01:42.270
<v Speaker 1>whatever it becomes,</v>

47
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.340
<v Speaker 1>what's happening is that the excess possibility in some sense is being</v>

48
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.920
<v Speaker 1>demolished by experience.</v>

49
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.140
<v Speaker 1>So the Tirana cull aspect of enculturation is something that's real because it</v>

50
00:01:55.141 --> 00:01:56.010
<v Speaker 1>makes you,</v>

51
00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.020
<v Speaker 1>in large part what you are.</v>

52
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.400
<v Speaker 1>And you have to understand as well that that's necessary because it's better to</v>

53
00:02:02.401 --> 00:02:05.880
<v Speaker 1>be something in the final analysis.</v>

54
00:02:05.881 --> 00:02:08.190
<v Speaker 1>It's better to be something than to be nothing.</v>

55
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:09.930
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

56
00:02:09.931 --> 00:02:14.080
<v Speaker 1>we still have residual dreams like those expressed by Peter Pan,</v>

57
00:02:14.081 --> 00:02:17.430
<v Speaker 1>say who's the boy that never wants to grow up because he doesn't want to attain</v>

58
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.470
<v Speaker 1>any final and fixed form.</v>

59
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.830
<v Speaker 1>And it's interesting because in one respect,</v>

60
00:02:22.831 --> 00:02:24.360
<v Speaker 1>as you progress through your life,</v>

61
00:02:24.361 --> 00:02:25.290
<v Speaker 1>you're climbing,</v>

62
00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:26.580
<v Speaker 1>assuming things are going well,</v>

63
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.860
<v Speaker 1>you're climbing to ever new heights.</v>

64
00:02:28.861 --> 00:02:29.890
<v Speaker 1>But on the other hand,</v>

65
00:02:29.891 --> 00:02:30.480
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

66
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.200
<v Speaker 1>the direction that you're going in constantly narrows as you age.</v>

67
00:02:34.201 --> 00:02:36.000
<v Speaker 1>So there's a real trade off there.</v>

68
00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:36.091
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

69
00:02:36.091 --> 00:02:36.380
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

70
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.470
<v Speaker 1>and I think the existential angst that's caused as a consequence of that trade</v>

71
00:02:40.471 --> 00:02:42.060
<v Speaker 1>off is often real.</v>

72
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.230
<v Speaker 1>And I also think that adolescents and early adults feel this most intently,</v>

73
00:02:46.231 --> 00:02:50.520
<v Speaker 1>which is part of the reason why they tend to rebel against social structures in</v>

74
00:02:50.521 --> 00:02:51.001
<v Speaker 1>general.</v>

75
00:02:51.001 --> 00:02:51.331
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

76
00:02:51.331 --> 00:02:51.491
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

77
00:02:51.491 --> 00:02:55.050
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the military industrial complex or the corporate world or</v>

78
00:02:55.051 --> 00:02:56.700
<v Speaker 1>globalization or what have you,</v>

79
00:02:56.701 --> 00:03:00.940
<v Speaker 1>is that you have these large structures that represent the tier radical aspect</v>

80
00:03:00.941 --> 00:03:01.860
<v Speaker 1>of social being.</v>

81
00:03:01.861 --> 00:03:02.200
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

82
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.200
<v Speaker 1>and it's no wonder that the fact of those structures in genders rebellion,</v>

83
00:03:07.451 --> 00:03:08.284
<v Speaker 1>it should.</v>

84
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.281
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

85
00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:12.370
<v Speaker 1>it's also no wonder that structures like that exist because if they didn't</v>

86
00:03:12.371 --> 00:03:12.761
<v Speaker 1>exist,</v>

87
00:03:12.761 --> 00:03:16.070
<v Speaker 1>then people would have no way of interrelating there.</v>

88
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.260
<v Speaker 1>There are social being,</v>

89
00:03:17.261 --> 00:03:19.700
<v Speaker 1>and we would revert back to the sort of hogs,</v>

90
00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.160
<v Speaker 1>Ian State of war,</v>

91
00:03:21.161 --> 00:03:24.040
<v Speaker 1>where everybody's arms are around everybody else's throat.</v>

92
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.410
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean the payoff is always good.</v>
