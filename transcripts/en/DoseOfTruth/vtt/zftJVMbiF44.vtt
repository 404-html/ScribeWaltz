1
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:09.243
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

2
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.310
<v Speaker 1>We've been talking about</v>

3
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.900
<v Speaker 1>a code of representations in some sense</v>

4
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.940
<v Speaker 1>of symbolic representation and I've been trying to guide you through some</v>

5
00:00:28.011 --> 00:00:32.030
<v Speaker 1>developing understanding of that code of symbolic representation so that as we</v>

6
00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:33.320
<v Speaker 1>progress through the course,</v>

7
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.660
<v Speaker 1>you'll have the ground rules in some sense for interpreting all the different</v>

8
00:00:38.661 --> 00:00:39.830
<v Speaker 1>theories that we encounter.</v>

9
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.740
<v Speaker 1>And we're going to continue that today.</v>

10
00:00:42.741 --> 00:00:47.120
<v Speaker 1>This is the last lecture on sort of pre psychoanalytic conceptions of</v>

11
00:00:47.121 --> 00:00:51.770
<v Speaker 1>personality and then we moved to Piaget and then to you.</v>

12
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:52.753
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

13
00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.340
<v Speaker 1>the first thing I tried to point out to you was that social primates like us</v>

14
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.420
<v Speaker 1>likely have a cognitive structure that's based on social categories and that</v>

15
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.110
<v Speaker 1>when our cognitive systems elaborate it up enough to start thinking about the</v>

16
00:01:09.111 --> 00:01:12.860
<v Speaker 1>world in more abstract terms beyond our immediate environment,</v>

17
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.960
<v Speaker 1>there's a high probability that we learned,</v>

18
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.020
<v Speaker 1>we used the same cognitive structures that had evolved to begin the process of</v>

19
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.090
<v Speaker 1>abstract conceptualization.</v>

20
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.220
<v Speaker 1>And so in some sense you could say we used our knowledge of personality to start</v>

21
00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:33.221
<v Speaker 1>to understand the external world based on the initial axiomatic assumption.</v>

22
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.310
<v Speaker 1>It's not a cognitive assumption.</v>

23
00:01:35.311 --> 00:01:40.311
<v Speaker 1>It was a perceptual assumption that the world was like a personality.</v>

24
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:41.840
<v Speaker 1>And we do this automatically.</v>

25
00:01:41.841 --> 00:01:43.430
<v Speaker 1>So I want to show you a little video here.</v>

26
00:01:43.431 --> 00:01:44.540
<v Speaker 1>This is quite a famous video.</v>

27
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:45.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

28
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.620
<v Speaker 1>it shows you how easily you can abstract out and narrative from the most</v>

29
00:01:51.261 --> 00:01:52.820
<v Speaker 1>abstract of events.</v>

30
00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.291
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

31
00:01:59.291 --> 00:02:00.490
<v Speaker 1>so watch what happens.</v>

32
00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.721
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

33
00:02:11.721 --> 00:02:13.070
<v Speaker 1>let's watch that one more time.</v>

34
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.750
<v Speaker 1>So it's something like,</v>

35
00:02:26.751 --> 00:02:27.680
<v Speaker 1>we'll go over it again.</v>

36
00:02:27.681 --> 00:02:29.780
<v Speaker 1>It's something like the little circle.</v>

37
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.390
<v Speaker 1>The poor little circle is trying to escape and when it does,</v>

38
00:02:32.391 --> 00:02:34.910
<v Speaker 1>the bad gray triangle comes up and sort of steals it.</v>

39
00:02:34.911 --> 00:02:39.911
<v Speaker 1>And then a blue triangle has a little scrap with the gray triangle and puts the</v>

40
00:02:40.431 --> 00:02:43.310
<v Speaker 1>little yellow or the little circle back into its safe and closure.</v>

41
00:02:43.311 --> 00:02:43.581
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

42
00:02:43.581 --> 00:02:45.140
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>

43
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.700
<v Speaker 1>the reason that that demonstration was developed was to indicate or two and also</v>

44
00:02:49.701 --> 00:02:53.090
<v Speaker 1>to test how little information you really needed,</v>

45
00:02:53.091 --> 00:02:58.070
<v Speaker 1>how low resolution the information was that you needed in order to perceive,</v>

46
00:02:58.071 --> 00:02:59.150
<v Speaker 1>to directly perceive.</v>

47
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.550
<v Speaker 1>That was like a narrative.</v>

48
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:01.360
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

49
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.601
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

50
00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:03.970
<v Speaker 1>and that's a relatively complicated narrative.</v>

51
00:03:03.971 --> 00:03:08.971
<v Speaker 1>All things considered for a square two triangles and a circle interacting for</v>

52
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.540
<v Speaker 1>maybe three or four seconds.</v>

53
00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:11.080
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

54
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

55
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.610
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

56
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.270
<v Speaker 1>the point of this demonstration is to indicate just exactly how prepared you are</v>

57
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.610
<v Speaker 1>to read the world in narrative terms.</v>
