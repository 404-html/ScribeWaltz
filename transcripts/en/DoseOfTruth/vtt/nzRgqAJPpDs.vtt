1
00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.771
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2
00:00:06.771 --> 00:00:11.771
<v Speaker 1>I was very heartened Jordan's by your affirmation of the objectivity of moral</v>

3
00:00:13.851 --> 00:00:15.440
<v Speaker 1>values and duties.</v>

4
00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.830
<v Speaker 1>You said there are things that are unquestionably good and unquestionably evil,</v>

5
00:00:21.621 --> 00:00:25.210
<v Speaker 1>but these moral values are not things that are infected,</v>

6
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.810
<v Speaker 1>but they are discovered.</v>

7
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.350
<v Speaker 1>And I couldn't agree more and I would want to push you on this to say that this</v>

8
00:00:35.121 --> 00:00:40.121
<v Speaker 1>very consideration ought to help you to move through naturalism and beyond</v>

9
00:00:41.301 --> 00:00:46.301
<v Speaker 1>naturalism to a transcendent ground for the objectivity of these moral values</v>

10
00:00:47.241 --> 00:00:50.450
<v Speaker 1>and duties because they won't be found in naturalism.</v>

11
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.810
<v Speaker 1>The naturalist is trapped in the lower story.</v>

12
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.920
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

13
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:55.611
<v Speaker 1>objective.</v>

14
00:00:55.611 --> 00:01:00.611
<v Speaker 1>Moral values and duties are not physical entities described by the laws of</v>

15
00:01:01.101 --> 00:01:01.934
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>

16
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.610
<v Speaker 1>These are transcendent realities,</v>

17
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.600
<v Speaker 1>either play tonic or else grounded in God.</v>

18
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.770
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

19
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.770
<v Speaker 1>and therefore the very affirmation of the objectivity of moral values and</v>

20
00:01:16.101 --> 00:01:16.401
<v Speaker 1>duties.</v>

21
00:01:16.401 --> 00:01:19.600
<v Speaker 1>It was so strong throughout your talk I have,</v>

22
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:20.940
<v Speaker 1>which I just so appreciate it.</v>

23
00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:22.940
<v Speaker 1>So it's anti relativistic,</v>

24
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.690
<v Speaker 1>it's objective as stick.</v>

25
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.790
<v Speaker 1>I want to,</v>

26
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.560
<v Speaker 1>I want to encourage you to push through that naturalism to finding a</v>

27
00:01:30.561 --> 00:01:34.490
<v Speaker 1>transcendent ground for these in via awesome.</v>

28
00:01:34.491 --> 00:01:39.491
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the most plausible moral theory that will enable us to affirm the</v>

29
00:01:40.131 --> 00:01:42.440
<v Speaker 1>objectivity of these moral values and duties.</v>

30
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.943
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

31
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.040
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

32
00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.040
<v Speaker 3>I've tried to work out the sorts of ideas that I portrayed in this talk today</v>

33
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.030
<v Speaker 3>within a naturalistic framework as much as possible</v>

34
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.670
<v Speaker 3>because the naturalistic technique is so powerful,</v>

35
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.560
<v Speaker 3>not least for that,</v>

36
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.520
<v Speaker 3>but also because there's glimmerings in the scientific literature of</v>

37
00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.440
<v Speaker 3>the sorts of ideas that you portrayed when you mentioned that the evolutionary</v>

38
00:02:22.441 --> 00:02:26.310
<v Speaker 3>biologists are increasingly making the claim that morality is a biological</v>

39
00:02:26.311 --> 00:02:31.110
<v Speaker 3>adaptation and I think you can make a very strong case for that much stronger</v>

40
00:02:31.111 --> 00:02:33.090
<v Speaker 3>case than has actually been made so far.</v>

41
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.553
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

42
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.270
<v Speaker 3>I think there is a,</v>

43
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.040
<v Speaker 3>a very sophisticated ethic that has evolved that we recognize as a consequence</v>

44
00:02:44.161 --> 00:02:47.820
<v Speaker 3>of the evolution of our cognitive and emotional structures.</v>

45
00:02:47.821 --> 00:02:52.560
<v Speaker 3>I think that that recognition manifests itself in admiration.</v>

46
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.180
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

47
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.560
<v Speaker 3>people are very imitative.</v>

48
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.950
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the things that characterizes us in contradistinction animals who</v>

49
00:02:59.951 --> 00:03:01.660
<v Speaker 3>are not very imitative.</v>

50
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.990
<v Speaker 3>It's probably they're preconditioned for our linguistic capacity.</v>

51
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.300
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that characterize this human existence is the capacity to</v>

52
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.410
<v Speaker 3>spontaneously pick a model for emulation,</v>

53
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:15.310
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

54
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.450
<v Speaker 3>And model for admiration.</v>

55
00:03:16.451 --> 00:03:19.060
<v Speaker 3>And that's the manifestation of that moral instinct to say,</v>

56
00:03:19.061 --> 00:03:22.420
<v Speaker 3>well to admire is to want to copy say,</v>

57
00:03:22.421 --> 00:03:22.571
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

58
00:03:22.571 --> 00:03:23.560
<v Speaker 3>what do you want to copy?</v>

59
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.350
<v Speaker 3>What you want to copy that which is most admirable?</v>

60
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:27.880
<v Speaker 3>What is most admirable?</v>

61
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.170
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

62
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.510
<v Speaker 3>what is most admirable that starts to become a,</v>

63
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.240
<v Speaker 3>that starts to become a transcendent question,</v>

64
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.290
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

65
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.670
<v Speaker 3>You can imagine that the,</v>

66
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.530
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

67
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.920
<v Speaker 3>the local examples of what's admirable there,</v>

68
00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:42.960
<v Speaker 3>right in front of you and,</v>

69
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:43.920
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

70
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.310
<v Speaker 3>and their concrete and tangible.</v>

71
00:03:45.311 --> 00:03:47.560
<v Speaker 3>But to abstract out from that,</v>

72
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.790
<v Speaker 3>that which is admirable in and of itself is simultaneously to construct</v>

73
00:03:51.791 --> 00:03:54.280
<v Speaker 3>something like the representation of a transcendent good.</v>

74
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.270
<v Speaker 3>And that's to some degree how religious conceptions emerged from their</v>

75
00:03:58.271 --> 00:03:59.890
<v Speaker 3>underlying biological substrate.</v>

76
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:01.031
<v Speaker 3>Now you might say,</v>

77
00:04:01.031 --> 00:04:04.780
<v Speaker 3>well that's merely reducing the religious conceptualization,</v>

78
00:04:04.781 --> 00:04:07.960
<v Speaker 3>the religious abstraction of what's good to the biological sub strait.</v>

79
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.490
<v Speaker 3>And I think you can read it that way,</v>

80
00:04:09.491 --> 00:04:12.370
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think that that necessarily indicates what it is.</v>

81
00:04:12.371 --> 00:04:17.371
<v Speaker 3>I think that the entire process of evolution is somehow shaping itself around</v>

82
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.210
<v Speaker 3>maybe platonic ideas,</v>

83
00:04:21.211 --> 00:04:21.971
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>

84
00:04:21.971 --> 00:04:26.950
<v Speaker 3>some transcendent good and that it's a mistake to assume that just because you</v>

85
00:04:26.951 --> 00:04:31.270
<v Speaker 3>can make an association between the transcendent abstract good and the process</v>

86
00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:31.931
<v Speaker 3>of evolution,</v>

87
00:04:31.931 --> 00:04:34.090
<v Speaker 3>that one is necessarily reduceable to another.</v>

88
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:35.260
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't,</v>

89
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.830
<v Speaker 3>the way reality works commit</v>

90
00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.520
<v Speaker 1>the genetic fallacy to try to say that because one's moral beliefs originated</v>

91
00:04:44.541 --> 00:04:49.541
<v Speaker 1>through such a biological evolutionary process that therefore they are explained</v>

92
00:04:51.201 --> 00:04:54.990
<v Speaker 1>away and have no objective validity that that just,</v>

93
00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.410
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

94
00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.500
<v Speaker 3>I think partly what happens too is that</v>

95
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.100
<v Speaker 3>at that level of analysis,</v>

96
00:05:02.101 --> 00:05:05.360
<v Speaker 3>you have to start questioning your initial presumptions,</v>

97
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.400
<v Speaker 3>liked the idea that the most true truth is objective because I'm not sure it is.</v>

98
00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.890
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we understand what constitutes truth very well and there's the</v>

99
00:05:16.891 --> 00:05:21.600
<v Speaker 3>truth that you act out as well as the truth that tells you what the world is</v>

100
00:05:21.601 --> 00:05:24.180
<v Speaker 3>made of and those aren't necessarily the same thing.</v>

101
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.310
<v Speaker 3>And so things get very murky at that level of obstruction.</v>

102
00:05:29.311 --> 00:05:34.311
<v Speaker 3>But one thing I have learned from attempting to reduce religious preconceptions</v>

103
00:05:34.801 --> 00:05:39.180
<v Speaker 3>to their biological substrate is that there's always something left over that</v>

104
00:05:39.181 --> 00:05:40.320
<v Speaker 3>you haven't explained,</v>

105
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:41.211
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

106
00:05:41.211 --> 00:05:45.360
<v Speaker 3>it's not something trivial because every time I look into what's leftover,</v>

107
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.030
<v Speaker 3>it turns out to be an ultra bleat deep.</v>

108
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.920
<v Speaker 3>Then I get rid of some more of it and the rest becomes unalterably deep.</v>
