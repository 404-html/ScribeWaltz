1
00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.110
<v Speaker 1>Where does the information and dreams come from?</v>

2
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.710
<v Speaker 1>And I think what the w w where it comes from is that we watch the patterns that</v>

3
00:00:10.891 --> 00:00:13.830
<v Speaker 1>everyone acts out.</v>

4
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.840
<v Speaker 1>We've watched that forever and we've got some representations of those patterns.</v>

5
00:00:18.841 --> 00:00:20.280
<v Speaker 1>That's part of our cultural history.</v>

6
00:00:20.281 --> 00:00:21.990
<v Speaker 1>That's what's embedded in stories,</v>

7
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.430
<v Speaker 1>in fictional accounts of,</v>

8
00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.050
<v Speaker 1>of the story between good and evil,</v>

9
00:00:25.051 --> 00:00:26.940
<v Speaker 1>the bad guy and the good guy and the romance,</v>

10
00:00:26.941 --> 00:00:27.121
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:27.121 --> 00:00:27.720
<v Speaker 1>these are,</v>

12
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.650
<v Speaker 1>these are canonical patterns of being for people in and they deeply affect us</v>

13
00:00:31.651 --> 00:00:34.920
<v Speaker 1>because they represent what it is that we will act out in the world.</v>

14
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.280
<v Speaker 1>And then we fleshed that out with the individual information we have about</v>

15
00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:39.540
<v Speaker 1>ourselves and other people.</v>

16
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.490
<v Speaker 1>And so it's like there's a,</v>

17
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:42.540
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

18
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.540
<v Speaker 1>there's waves of a behavioral patterns that manifest themselves in the crowd</v>

19
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.160
<v Speaker 1>across time that great dramas are played on the crowd across time.</v>

20
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.160
<v Speaker 1>And the artists watched that and,</v>

21
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.010
<v Speaker 1>and they get intimations of what that is and they write it down and they tell us</v>

22
00:00:59.011 --> 00:01:01.230
<v Speaker 1>and then we're a little clearer about what we're up to.</v>

23
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:02.010
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

24
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.730
<v Speaker 1>Like a great dramatists like Shakespeare let's say is we know that what he wrote</v>

25
00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:06.960
<v Speaker 1>is fiction and then we say,</v>

26
00:01:06.961 --> 00:01:08.400
<v Speaker 1>well fiction isn't true.</v>

27
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.541
<v Speaker 1>But then you think,</v>

28
00:01:09.541 --> 00:01:10.380
<v Speaker 1>well wait a minute.</v>

29
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.430
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's true.</v>

30
00:01:11.431 --> 00:01:12.930
<v Speaker 1>Like numbers are true.</v>

31
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.010
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

32
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.890
<v Speaker 1>numbers are an abstraction from the underlying reality,</v>

33
00:01:16.891 --> 00:01:20.700
<v Speaker 1>but no one in their right mind would really think numbers aren't true.</v>

34
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.510
<v Speaker 1>You could even make a case that the numbers are more real than the things that</v>

35
00:01:24.511 --> 00:01:25.350
<v Speaker 1>they represent,</v>

36
00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:25.561
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

37
00:01:25.561 --> 00:01:28.230
<v Speaker 1>Cause the obstruction is so insanely powerful.</v>

38
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.730
<v Speaker 1>Once you have mathematics,</v>

39
00:01:29.731 --> 00:01:31.020
<v Speaker 1>you're just deadly.</v>

40
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.300
<v Speaker 1>You can move the world with mathematics.</v>

41
00:01:33.301 --> 00:01:36.990
<v Speaker 1>And so it's not obvious that the abstraction is less real than the,</v>

42
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.970
<v Speaker 1>than the,</v>

43
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.560
<v Speaker 1>than the more concrete reality.</v>

44
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.530
<v Speaker 1>And you take a work of fiction like hamlet and you think,</v>

45
00:01:43.531 --> 00:01:44.800
<v Speaker 1>well is that it's,</v>

46
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.890
<v Speaker 1>it's not true because it's fiction.</v>

47
00:01:46.891 --> 00:01:47.491
<v Speaker 1>But then you think,</v>

48
00:01:47.491 --> 00:01:48.061
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

49
00:01:48.061 --> 00:01:49.590
<v Speaker 1>what kind of explanation is that?</v>

50
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.300
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe it's more true than nonfiction because it takes what the story that</v>

51
00:01:54.301 --> 00:01:57.930
<v Speaker 1>needs to be told about you and the story that needs to be told about you and you</v>

52
00:01:57.931 --> 00:02:00.160
<v Speaker 1>and you and you and abstracts that out.</v>

53
00:02:00.161 --> 00:02:00.451
<v Speaker 1>And says,</v>

54
00:02:00.451 --> 00:02:00.870
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

55
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.160
<v Speaker 1>here's something that's a key part of the human experience as such,</v>

56
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.971
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

57
00:02:05.971 --> 00:02:06.271
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>

58
00:02:06.271 --> 00:02:11.271
<v Speaker 1>it's an abstraction from this underlying noisy substrate and people are affected</v>

59
00:02:12.721 --> 00:02:17.160
<v Speaker 1>by it because they see that the thing that's represented as part of the pattern</v>

60
00:02:17.161 --> 00:02:18.030
<v Speaker 1>of their being,</v>

61
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.560
<v Speaker 1>that's the right way to think about it.</v>

62
00:02:19.561 --> 00:02:21.510
<v Speaker 1>And then with these old stories,</v>

63
00:02:21.511 --> 00:02:22.590
<v Speaker 1>these ancient stories,</v>

64
00:02:22.591 --> 00:02:26.460
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me like that process has been occurring for thousands of years.</v>

65
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like we watched ourselves and we extracted out some stories,</v>

66
00:02:30.211 --> 00:02:35.070
<v Speaker 1>we imitated each other and we represented that in drama and then we distilled</v>

67
00:02:35.071 --> 00:02:39.150
<v Speaker 1>the drama and we got a representation of the distillation and then we did it</v>

68
00:02:39.151 --> 00:02:43.570
<v Speaker 1>again at the end of that process that took God only knows how long.</v>

69
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.510
<v Speaker 1>I think some of these stories,</v>

70
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.290
<v Speaker 1>they've traced fairytales back 10,000 years,</v>

71
00:02:49.291 --> 00:02:51.960
<v Speaker 1>some fairy tales in relatively unchanged for him.</v>

72
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.250
<v Speaker 1>And it certainly seems to me that the archeological evidence for example,</v>

73
00:02:56.251 --> 00:02:59.060
<v Speaker 1>suggests that the really old stories that that,</v>

74
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.820
<v Speaker 1>that the Bible begins with our,</v>

75
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.410
<v Speaker 1>at least that old and likely embedded in a prehistory that's far older than</v>

76
00:03:05.411 --> 00:03:05.890
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

77
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:06.611
<v Speaker 1>And you might think,</v>

78
00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:07.444
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

79
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.070
<v Speaker 1>how can you be so sure?</v>

80
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.090
<v Speaker 1>The answer to that in part is that cultures that don't change,</v>

81
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.620
<v Speaker 1>like the ancient cultures,</v>

82
00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:14.861
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

83
00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:17.530
<v Speaker 1>They didn't change as fast as they stayed the same.</v>

84
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.180
<v Speaker 1>That's the answer.</v>

85
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.961
<v Speaker 1>So they call it,</v>

86
00:03:19.961 --> 00:03:22.840
<v Speaker 1>they keep their information moving generation to generation.</v>

87
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.520
<v Speaker 1>That's how they stay the same.</v>

88
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.781
<v Speaker 1>And so we know,</v>

89
00:03:25.781 --> 00:03:27.400
<v Speaker 1>again in the archaeological record,</v>

90
00:03:27.401 --> 00:03:31.360
<v Speaker 1>there are records of rituals that have remained relatively unbroken for up to</v>

91
00:03:31.361 --> 00:03:32.530
<v Speaker 1>20,000 years.</v>

92
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.940
<v Speaker 1>It was discovered in caves in Japan that were set up for a particular kind of</v>

93
00:03:36.941 --> 00:03:40.570
<v Speaker 1>bare worship that was also characteristic of western Europe.</v>

94
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.210
<v Speaker 1>So these things can last for very long periods of time.</v>

95
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.310
<v Speaker 1>We're watching each other act in the world.</v>

96
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:50.900
<v Speaker 1>And then the question is,</v>

97
00:03:50.901 --> 00:03:51.051
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

98
00:03:51.051 --> 00:03:53.090
<v Speaker 1>how long have we been watching each other?</v>

99
00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.420
<v Speaker 1>And the answered that in some senses,</v>

100
00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:00.080
<v Speaker 1>while as long as there's been creatures with nervous systems and that's a long</v>

101
00:04:00.081 --> 00:04:00.471
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

102
00:04:00.471 --> 00:04:00.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

103
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.660
<v Speaker 1>that's some hundreds of millions of years,</v>

104
00:04:02.661 --> 00:04:03.980
<v Speaker 1>perhaps longer than that.</v>

105
00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.580
<v Speaker 1>We'd been watching each other trying to figure out what we're up to across that</v>

106
00:04:07.581 --> 00:04:08.780
<v Speaker 1>entire span of time.</v>

107
00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.420
<v Speaker 1>Some of that knowledge is built right into our bodies,</v>

108
00:04:11.421 --> 00:04:13.160
<v Speaker 1>which is why we can dance with each other,</v>

109
00:04:13.161 --> 00:04:13.821
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

110
00:04:13.821 --> 00:04:14.061
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

111
00:04:14.061 --> 00:04:18.200
<v Speaker 1>Because understanding isn't just something that you,</v>

112
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.060
<v Speaker 1>that you have as an abstraction.</v>

113
00:04:20.061 --> 00:04:21.500
<v Speaker 1>It's something that you act out.</v>

114
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:22.130
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

115
00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.100
<v Speaker 1>that's what children are doing when they're learning to rough and tumble plays.</v>

116
00:04:25.101 --> 00:04:29.150
<v Speaker 1>They're learning to integrate their body with the body of someone else in a</v>

117
00:04:29.151 --> 00:04:30.200
<v Speaker 1>harmonious way,</v>

118
00:04:30.201 --> 00:04:31.730
<v Speaker 1>learning to cooperate and compete,</v>

119
00:04:31.731 --> 00:04:34.610
<v Speaker 1>and that's all instantiated right into their body.</v>

120
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.020
<v Speaker 1>It's not abstract knowledge.</v>

121
00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.700
<v Speaker 1>They don't know that they're doing that.</v>

122
00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:38.930
<v Speaker 1>They're just doing it.</v>

123
00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.740
<v Speaker 1>And so we can even use our body as a representational platform.</v>

124
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.710
<v Speaker 1>So we've been studying each other for a long time.</v>

125
00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.060
<v Speaker 1>Abstracting out what is it that we're up to and that's that.</v>

126
00:04:50.061 --> 00:04:51.680
<v Speaker 1>That's what is it we're up to,</v>

127
00:04:51.681 --> 00:04:53.300
<v Speaker 1>what should we be up to?</v>

128
00:04:53.301 --> 00:04:55.250
<v Speaker 1>That's even a more fundamental question.</v>

129
00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.400
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to live in the world and you're going to do it properly,</v>

130
00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.390
<v Speaker 1>what does properly mean and how is it that you might go about that?</v>

131
00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:03.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

132
00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.670
<v Speaker 1>it's the right question,</v>

133
00:05:04.671 --> 00:05:04.941
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

134
00:05:04.941 --> 00:05:06.200
<v Speaker 1>It's what everyone wants to know.</v>

135
00:05:06.201 --> 00:05:07.490
<v Speaker 1>How do you live in the world?</v>

136
00:05:07.491 --> 00:05:09.050
<v Speaker 1>Not what is the world made of.</v>

137
00:05:09.051 --> 00:05:10.370
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same question.</v>

138
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:11.900
<v Speaker 1>How do you live in the world?</v>

139
00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.040
<v Speaker 1>It's the eternal question of human beings and I guess we're the only species</v>

140
00:05:16.041 --> 00:05:19.070
<v Speaker 1>that has ever really asked that question because all the other animals,</v>

141
00:05:19.071 --> 00:05:20.720
<v Speaker 1>they just go and do whatever they do,</v>

142
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.883
<v Speaker 1>not us.</v>

143
00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.510
<v Speaker 1>It's a question for us.</v>

144
00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:24.710
<v Speaker 1>We've had to,</v>

145
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.240
<v Speaker 1>we have to become aware of it.</v>

146
00:05:26.241 --> 00:05:27.740
<v Speaker 1>We have to be able to speak it.</v>

147
00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.270
<v Speaker 1>God only knows why,</v>

148
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.700
<v Speaker 1>but that seems to be the situation.</v>

149
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.400
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

150
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.710
<v Speaker 1>we act that acting is shaped by the world,</v>

151
00:05:37.711 --> 00:05:41.010
<v Speaker 1>that acting is shaped by society into something that we don't understand,</v>

152
00:05:41.011 --> 00:05:43.080
<v Speaker 1>but that we can model that.</v>

153
00:05:43.081 --> 00:05:43.841
<v Speaker 1>We can model it.</v>

154
00:05:43.841 --> 00:05:45.210
<v Speaker 1>We model it in our stories,</v>

155
00:05:45.211 --> 00:05:49.710
<v Speaker 1>we Marlett with our bodies and that's where the dream gets its information.</v>

156
00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.910
<v Speaker 1>The dream is part of the process that's watching everything and then trying to</v>

157
00:05:53.911 --> 00:05:55.380
<v Speaker 1>formulate it and trying to say,</v>

158
00:05:55.381 --> 00:05:55.830
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

159
00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.780
<v Speaker 1>trying to get the signal from the noise and to portrayed in dramatic form</v>

160
00:05:59.781 --> 00:06:01.250
<v Speaker 1>because the dream is little drama.</v>

161
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.460
<v Speaker 1>And then you get the chairs to s park about what that dream is and then you have</v>

162
00:06:06.871 --> 00:06:07.340
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

163
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.040
<v Speaker 1>You have something like articulated knowledge at that point.</v>

164
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.470
<v Speaker 1>And so the Bible I would say is,</v>

165
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.360
<v Speaker 1>is it sort of,</v>

166
00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:18.860
<v Speaker 1>it exists in that space that's half into the dream and half into articulated</v>

167
00:06:18.861 --> 00:06:19.550
<v Speaker 1>knowledge.</v>

168
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:20.660
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

169
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.480
<v Speaker 1>And going into it to find out what the stories are about Ken,</v>

170
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:29.600
<v Speaker 1>what can it can aid our self understanding.</v>

171
00:06:29.601 --> 00:06:31.250
<v Speaker 1>And then the other issue is,</v>

172
00:06:31.251 --> 00:06:32.660
<v Speaker 1>is that if nene,</v>

173
00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:37.280
<v Speaker 1>she was correct and if Dostoevsky or young was correct and Dostoevsky as well</v>

174
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.430
<v Speaker 1>without the cornerstone that that understanding provides,</v>

175
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.480
<v Speaker 1>we're lost.</v>

176
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.580
<v Speaker 1>And that's not good because then we're susceptible to psych pathology.</v>

177
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.500
<v Speaker 1>That's psychological pathology.</v>

178
00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:52.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

179
00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.610
<v Speaker 1>the people who are ad adamant,</v>

180
00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:00.740
<v Speaker 1>anti religious thinkers seem to believe that if we abandoned our immersement in</v>

181
00:07:01.851 --> 00:07:02.870
<v Speaker 1>the underlying dream,</v>

182
00:07:02.871 --> 00:07:07.340
<v Speaker 1>that we'd all instantly become rationalists like Descartes or bacon or you know,</v>

183
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:08.210
<v Speaker 1>intelligent,</v>

184
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:09.260
<v Speaker 1>clear thinking,</v>

185
00:07:09.261 --> 00:07:11.120
<v Speaker 1>rational scientific people.</v>

186
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:14.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that for a moment because I don't think there's any evidence for</v>

187
00:07:14.271 --> 00:07:14.361
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

188
00:07:14.361 --> 00:07:19.361
<v Speaker 1>I think we would become so irrational so rapidly that the weirdest mysteries of</v>

189
00:07:19.461 --> 00:07:23.570
<v Speaker 1>Catholicism would see positively rational by contrast,</v>

190
00:07:23.571 --> 00:07:25.010
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's already happening.</v>
