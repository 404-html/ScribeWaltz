1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:00.450
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

2
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.350
<v Speaker 1>I've been telling people online in various ways and in lectures that they should</v>

3
00:00:04.351 --> 00:00:07.380
<v Speaker 1>start fixing up the world by cleaning up the room.</v>

4
00:00:07.381 --> 00:00:10.650
<v Speaker 1>And I wanted to just elaborate on that a little bit before I get back to the</v>

5
00:00:10.651 --> 00:00:12.510
<v Speaker 1>lecture itself.</v>

6
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.560
<v Speaker 1>So I'd say it's become this Internet weird Internet meme,</v>

7
00:00:16.561 --> 00:00:17.394
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.630
<v Speaker 1>and it's a joke and good,</v>

9
00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:22.464
<v Speaker 1>it's a joke.</v>

10
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.460
<v Speaker 1>I really happy about the fact that so much of this has got like the leaving of</v>

11
00:00:26.461 --> 00:00:29.790
<v Speaker 1>humor and it's really important because that's what stops things from</v>

12
00:00:29.791 --> 00:00:30.810
<v Speaker 1>degenerating into,</v>

13
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:32.730
<v Speaker 1>into conflict humor.</v>

14
00:00:32.731 --> 00:00:36.810
<v Speaker 1>And I was thinking about this idea of cleaning up your room in relationship to</v>

15
00:00:36.811 --> 00:00:37.860
<v Speaker 1>the mustard seed idea.</v>

16
00:00:37.861 --> 00:00:40.500
<v Speaker 1>And you see the thing about cleaning up your room,</v>

17
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.730
<v Speaker 1>this is also something I learned from Carl Young and his studies on alchemy</v>

18
00:00:44.731 --> 00:00:46.440
<v Speaker 1>because for young,</v>

19
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.100
<v Speaker 1>when the outcomist was attempting to make the philosopher's stone and he was not</v>

20
00:00:50.101 --> 00:00:52.680
<v Speaker 1>only engaged in the transformation of the material world,</v>

21
00:00:52.681 --> 00:00:57.681
<v Speaker 1>but he was engaged in a process of self transformation that occurred at the same</v>

22
00:00:57.691 --> 00:00:58.411
<v Speaker 1>time as the,</v>

23
00:00:58.411 --> 00:00:59.430
<v Speaker 1>as the chemical trend,</v>

24
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.110
<v Speaker 1>as the chemical transformation.</v>

25
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.120
<v Speaker 1>So it was a psychological work in some sense.</v>

26
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.140
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you want to sort out your room and beautified cause the beauty is also</v>

27
00:01:07.141 --> 00:01:07.800
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

28
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.710
<v Speaker 1>And let's say that all you have is just a little room like you're not rich,</v>

29
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.170
<v Speaker 1>you're poor and you don't have any power.</v>

30
00:01:13.171 --> 00:01:13.861
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing.</v>

31
00:01:13.861 --> 00:01:17.250
<v Speaker 1>But you've got your damn room and you've got this space right in front of you.</v>

32
00:01:17.251 --> 00:01:17.790
<v Speaker 1>You know that,</v>

33
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.320
<v Speaker 1>that that's a part of the cosmos that you can come to grips with and you might</v>

34
00:01:22.321 --> 00:01:22.531
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

35
00:01:22.531 --> 00:01:24.810
<v Speaker 1>well what's there in front of you right in front of you?</v>

36
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.010
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is,</v>

37
00:01:26.011 --> 00:01:27.870
<v Speaker 1>it depends on how open your eyes are,</v>

38
00:01:27.871 --> 00:01:29.190
<v Speaker 1>that that's the proper answer.</v>

39
00:01:29.191 --> 00:01:30.630
<v Speaker 1>Because you could say,</v>

40
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.370
<v Speaker 1>w William Blake said this,</v>

41
00:01:32.371 --> 00:01:33.210
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

42
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.320
<v Speaker 1>eldest Huxley made comments that were very similar that in a transcendent state,</v>

43
00:01:37.321 --> 00:01:39.150
<v Speaker 1>you can see infinity in the finite.</v>

44
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.050
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>

45
00:01:40.051 --> 00:01:40.691
<v Speaker 1>well you can say,</v>

46
00:01:40.691 --> 00:01:44.160
<v Speaker 1>and you can see infinity in what you have within your grasp.</v>

47
00:01:44.161 --> 00:01:45.350
<v Speaker 1>If you look and you could say,</v>

48
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.040
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's the case with your room.</v>

49
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.740
<v Speaker 1>And so you want to clean up your room.</v>

50
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:50.460
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

51
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.030
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

52
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.811
<v Speaker 1>how do you do that?</v>

53
00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:52.644
<v Speaker 1>Exactly?</v>

54
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.191
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

55
00:01:53.191 --> 00:01:55.530
<v Speaker 1>the room is a room is a place to sleep.</v>

56
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.110
<v Speaker 1>And so if you set your room up properly,</v>

57
00:01:58.111 --> 00:02:01.260
<v Speaker 1>then you figure out how to sleep and when you should sleep and how you should</v>

58
00:02:01.261 --> 00:02:01.591
<v Speaker 1>sleep.</v>

59
00:02:01.591 --> 00:02:04.320
<v Speaker 1>And then you figure out when you should wake up and then you figure out,</v>

60
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.170
<v Speaker 1>well what clothes you should wear because they have to be arranged properly in</v>

61
00:02:07.171 --> 00:02:07.621
<v Speaker 1>your dresser.</v>

62
00:02:07.621 --> 00:02:09.450
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to have some place to put your clothes.</v>

63
00:02:09.451 --> 00:02:10.620
<v Speaker 1>And if you're going to have some clothes,</v>

64
00:02:10.621 --> 00:02:12.900
<v Speaker 1>you have to figure out what you're going to wear those clothes to do,</v>

65
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.010
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

66
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.650
<v Speaker 1>And then that means that you have to figure out what you're going to do and then</v>

67
00:02:16.651 --> 00:02:20.280
<v Speaker 1>your room has to serve that purpose because otherwise it isn't set up properly.</v>

68
00:02:20.281 --> 00:02:22.140
<v Speaker 1>And if it doesn't set up,</v>

69
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.300
<v Speaker 1>if it doesn't serve your purposes,</v>

70
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.030
<v Speaker 1>you will be unhappy and not happy in the room.</v>

71
00:02:27.031 --> 00:02:32.031
<v Speaker 1>Because the way that we perceive the world is as a place to move from point a to</v>

72
00:02:32.581 --> 00:02:33.630
<v Speaker 1>point B in.</v>

73
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.980
<v Speaker 1>And then if the place that we're in facilitates that movement,</v>

74
00:02:37.981 --> 00:02:39.210
<v Speaker 1>then we're happy to be there.</v>

75
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.290
<v Speaker 1>And if the place that we're in serves as an obstacle to that movement,</v>

76
00:02:43.291 --> 00:02:45.030
<v Speaker 1>then we're unhappy to be there.</v>

77
00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:48.720
<v Speaker 1>And so what it means to set up your room is that you have to have somewhere to</v>

78
00:02:48.721 --> 00:02:50.130
<v Speaker 1>go that's worthwhile.</v>

79
00:02:50.131 --> 00:02:53.550
<v Speaker 1>Or You can't set up your room and then your room has to be set up to facilitate</v>

80
00:02:53.551 --> 00:02:54.300
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

81
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.620
<v Speaker 1>And then the next thing is,</v>

82
00:02:55.621 --> 00:02:55.741
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

83
00:02:55.741 --> 00:02:57.390
<v Speaker 1>maybe you have to make it beautiful,</v>

84
00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.500
<v Speaker 1>but that's not easy,</v>

85
00:02:58.501 --> 00:02:58.711
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

86
00:02:58.711 --> 00:03:00.430
<v Speaker 1>That means you have to have some taste.</v>

87
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.200
<v Speaker 1>And that doesn't mean you have to have money.</v>

88
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.093
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>

89
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.540
<v Speaker 1>because you can be garish with money and you can be tasteful with nothing.</v>

90
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.920
<v Speaker 1>All you need is taste and taste beats money when it comes to beautifying things.</v>

91
00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:12.580
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

92
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.380
<v Speaker 1>Not that money is trivial because it's not,</v>

93
00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:15.550
<v Speaker 1>the taste is crucial.</v>

94
00:03:15.551 --> 00:03:19.870
<v Speaker 1>And people who are very artistically oriented can make beautiful things out of</v>

95
00:03:19.871 --> 00:03:20.800
<v Speaker 1>virtually nothing.</v>

96
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:21.791
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>

97
00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:24.940
<v Speaker 1>the literature suggests that if you're going to make beautiful things,</v>

98
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.740
<v Speaker 1>putting real constraints on,</v>

99
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.390
<v Speaker 1>on what you allow yourself to do,</v>

100
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.420
<v Speaker 1>facilitates creativity instead of interfering with it.</v>

101
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.420
<v Speaker 1>Because let's say you have to make something out of nothing,</v>

102
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.110
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

103
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.030
<v Speaker 1>Which I suppose would be a Godly Act,</v>

104
00:03:37.031 --> 00:03:37.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

105
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.870
<v Speaker 1>You have to make something out of nothing and you have to be creative in order</v>

106
00:03:40.871 --> 00:03:41.704
<v Speaker 1>to do that.</v>

107
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.450
<v Speaker 1>And so then to beautify your room means that you also have to develop your</v>

108
00:03:46.451 --> 00:03:47.860
<v Speaker 1>capacity to be creative.</v>

109
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.640
<v Speaker 1>And so then you can make your room shine.</v>

110
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.790
<v Speaker 1>But then what'll happen is that if your family isn't together,</v>

111
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.080
<v Speaker 1>they will interfere with that.</v>

112
00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.320
<v Speaker 1>You will interfere with that because you won't have the discipline to do it</v>

113
00:03:59.321 --> 00:03:59.711
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>

114
00:03:59.711 --> 00:04:01.600
<v Speaker 1>But then when you start building this,</v>

115
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:02.260
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

116
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.130
<v Speaker 1>this little microcosm of perfection with what you have at hand,</v>

117
00:04:06.131 --> 00:04:09.910
<v Speaker 1>then it'll evoke all the pathologies of everyone in your household.</v>

118
00:04:09.911 --> 00:04:11.560
<v Speaker 1>The wonder what the hell you're up to in there.</v>

119
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.620
<v Speaker 1>And they won't necessarily be happy because if you're,</v>

120
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.390
<v Speaker 1>if they're in a lowly place,</v>

121
00:04:16.391 --> 00:04:16.841
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

122
00:04:16.841 --> 00:04:17.471
<v Speaker 1>and so are you,</v>

123
00:04:17.471 --> 00:04:21.370
<v Speaker 1>and you're trying to move out of that then that the higher you move out of that,</v>

124
00:04:21.371 --> 00:04:23.560
<v Speaker 1>the more the place they're in looks bad.</v>

125
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:24.551
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>

126
00:04:24.551 --> 00:04:24.701
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

127
00:04:24.701 --> 00:04:28.180
<v Speaker 1>what they should do is celebrate your victory over chaos and evil.</v>

128
00:04:28.181 --> 00:04:29.410
<v Speaker 1>But that isn't what will happen.</v>

129
00:04:29.411 --> 00:04:32.650
<v Speaker 1>What will happen instead is that they will attempt to pull you back down.</v>

130
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:33.880
<v Speaker 1>They'll attempt to,</v>

131
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.610
<v Speaker 1>and I mean obviously all families don't do that,</v>

132
00:04:36.611 --> 00:04:37.060
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

133
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.060
<v Speaker 1>but all families do that to some degree and some families do almost nothing but</v>

134
00:04:42.101 --> 00:04:42.850
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

135
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.330
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is that if you're going to organize your room,</v>

136
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.390
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to have to confront the devils in your house.</v>

137
00:04:49.391 --> 00:04:50.500
<v Speaker 1>And that's often,</v>

138
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.910
<v Speaker 1>that's often a terrifying thing because some of those devils have have lineages</v>

139
00:04:54.911 --> 00:04:55.990
<v Speaker 1>that go back many,</v>

140
00:04:55.991 --> 00:04:56.351
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

141
00:04:56.351 --> 00:04:57.580
<v Speaker 1>many generations.</v>

142
00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.240
<v Speaker 1>And God only knows what you have to struggle with in order to overcome that.</v>

143
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.840
<v Speaker 1>And so and so to sort yourself out into fix up your room is a nontrivial matter.</v>

144
00:05:07.481 --> 00:05:08.140
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

145
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.910
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>

146
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.060
<v Speaker 1>you can do that.</v>

147
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.560
<v Speaker 1>You'll learn by doing that.</v>

148
00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:14.470
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe you'll learn enough by doing that so that you can fix up your</v>

149
00:05:14.471 --> 00:05:15.370
<v Speaker 1>family a little bit.</v>

150
00:05:15.371 --> 00:05:16.900
<v Speaker 1>And then having done that,</v>

151
00:05:16.901 --> 00:05:20.410
<v Speaker 1>you'll have enough characters so that when you try to operate in the world at</v>

152
00:05:20.411 --> 00:05:20.951
<v Speaker 1>your job,</v>

153
00:05:20.951 --> 00:05:23.320
<v Speaker 1>or maybe in the broader social spheres,</v>

154
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.740
<v Speaker 1>that you'll be a force for good instead of harm because you'll have learned some</v>

155
00:05:26.741 --> 00:05:31.741
<v Speaker 1>humility by noting just how difficult it was to put your damn room together well</v>

156
00:05:31.961 --> 00:05:33.340
<v Speaker 1>and yourself for that matter.</v>

157
00:05:33.341 --> 00:05:37.810
<v Speaker 1>And so you'll proceed cautiously with your eyes open towards the good.</v>
