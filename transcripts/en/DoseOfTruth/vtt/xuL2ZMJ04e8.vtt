<v Speaker 2>and university governance.</v>

25
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.810
<v Speaker 2>Our guest today is Dr. Jordan Peterson,</v>

26
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.140
<v Speaker 2>a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto,</v>

27
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.360
<v Speaker 2>and a clinical psychologist.</v>

28
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.320
<v Speaker 2>His many publications include his recently published book,</v>

29
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.150
<v Speaker 2>12 rules for life,</v>

30
00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.510
<v Speaker 2>an antidote to chaos and his research spans a number of topics including the</v>

31
00:02:02.611 --> 00:02:07.611
<v Speaker 2>psychology of religion and the modern understanding of creativity and</v>

32
00:02:07.741 --> 00:02:08.574
<v Speaker 2>personality.</v>

33
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.670
<v Speaker 2>I know that today's lecture has generated a great deal of interest as is evident</v>

34
00:02:14.671 --> 00:02:16.590
<v Speaker 2>from the packed hall here today.</v>

35
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.920
<v Speaker 2>It's also generated a certain amount of heat.</v>

36
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.290
<v Speaker 2>The proposed topic,</v>

37
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.440
<v Speaker 2>the rising tide of compelled speech in Canada is for many a controversial one</v>

38
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.110
<v Speaker 2>and I know that many of you in the audience will hold widely divergent views.</v>

39
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.140
<v Speaker 2>I fully support your opportunity to be heard and should you wish challenge the</v>

40
00:02:40.141 --> 00:02:42.210
<v Speaker 2>speakers to defend their positions.</v>

41
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.550
<v Speaker 2>I know that today's speakers likewise share this conviction and we'll welcome</v>

42
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.610
<v Speaker 2>your comments and questions as might be appropriate for a lecture series named</v>

43
00:02:54.241 --> 00:02:55.110
<v Speaker 2>after liberty.</v>

44
00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.610
<v Speaker 2>I believe it is also important for me to affirm at the outset that the core</v>

45
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.640
<v Speaker 2>values of the Faculty of law end of Queens University include academic freedom</v>

46
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.930
<v Speaker 2>and respectful dialogue among those with differing views.</v>

47
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.030
<v Speaker 2>This includes providing our speakers with the opportunity to be heard and</v>

48
00:03:16.031 --> 00:03:20.830
<v Speaker 2>providing all of you with the opportunity to respond in a respectful</v>

49
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:21.753
<v Speaker 2>environment,</v>

50
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.590
<v Speaker 2>free from any harassment or any attempts to shut down the conversation.</v>

51
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.300
<v Speaker 2>So it is in this spirit of free and respectful academic exchange that I'm</v>

52
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.230
<v Speaker 2>pleased to launch or this new lecture series.</v>

53
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.550
<v Speaker 2>Welcome again and welcome to our guest and I look forward to our discussion.</v>

54
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:40.503
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

55
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.520
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

56
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.473
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Welcome and thank you for coming.</v>

59
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.170
<v Speaker 3>I would like to underline what bill said,</v>

60
00:04:02.171 --> 00:04:07.171
<v Speaker 3>which is that this event would not have happened without the initiative in</v>

61
00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.430
<v Speaker 3>support of Greg kids asking you.</v>

62
00:04:09.431 --> 00:04:10.151
<v Speaker 3>So Greg,</v>

63
00:04:10.151 --> 00:04:11.260

66
00:04:19.231 --> 00:04:20.100
<v Speaker 3>Before we start,</v>

67
00:04:20.101 --> 00:04:24.510
<v Speaker 3>I would like to thank some people from the Faculty of Law,</v>

68
00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.320
<v Speaker 3>Diane Butler at him,</v>

69
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.340
<v Speaker 3>Blake Galippo and Christina Julian for their help in putting this together.</v>

70
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.740
<v Speaker 3>I would also like to acknowledge the support,</v>

71
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.770
<v Speaker 3>help and generous assistance of several people around the university.</v>

72
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.210
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.060
<v Speaker 3>David Patterson and the campus security office.</v>

75
00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.500
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>helpful,</v>

78
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.680
<v Speaker 3>straightforward and I thank you very much for making this possible.</v>

79
00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.910
<v Speaker 3>I would also like to return to being Flanagan's observation about the importance</v>

80
00:05:07.531 --> 00:05:12.531
<v Speaker 3>of this moment and to acknowledge the role that both being Flanigan and</v>

81
00:05:13.681 --> 00:05:18.681
<v Speaker 3>principal wolf have played in enhancing the reputation of this university in</v>

82
00:05:21.661 --> 00:05:26.070
<v Speaker 3>terms of its commitment to academic freedom and academic debate.</v>

83
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:27.690
<v Speaker 3>They have</v>

84
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.250
<v Speaker 3>reflected an unflinching commitment to those ideas.</v>

85
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.160
<v Speaker 3>As Principal Wolf said on his blog,</v>

86
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.580
<v Speaker 3>informed respectful debate is central to academia.</v>

87
00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:42.450
<v Speaker 3>And Gentlemen,</v>

88
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.970
<v Speaker 3>I salute your academic statesmanship.</v>

89
00:05:44.971 --> 00:05:45.804
<v Speaker 3>Thank you very much.</v>

90
00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.920
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

91
00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

92
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.410
<v Speaker 3>we're going to proceed as follows.</v>

93
00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:04.070
<v Speaker 3>A the first thing I would like to say is that in the hall behind you afterwards,</v>

94
00:06:04.071 --> 00:06:06.860
<v Speaker 3>there will be some of Jordan's books on sale.</v>

95
00:06:06.861 --> 00:06:07.430
<v Speaker 3>12.</v>

96
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:08.263
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

97
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.021
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

98
00:06:09.021 --> 00:06:09.860
<v Speaker 3>what's the title again?</v>

99
00:06:09.861 --> 00:06:12.860
<v Speaker 3>12 rules for like 12,</v>

100
00:06:12.861 --> 00:06:15.050
<v Speaker 3>12 rules for like wanting to get the 12 what it was,</v>

101
00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.900
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

102
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:16.280
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

103
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.190
<v Speaker 3>that's not 12 steps.</v>

104
00:06:17.191 --> 00:06:18.140
<v Speaker 3>It's 12 rules.</v>

105
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:19.123
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

106
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:20.773
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

107
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.630
<v Speaker 3>we are going to proceed as follows.</v>

108
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:30.160
<v Speaker 3>Jordan and I are going to have a conversation for half an hour,</v>

109
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:36.310
<v Speaker 3>maybe 40 minutes and then we are going to throw the floor open to questions.</v>

110
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:41.480
<v Speaker 3>We'll describe what kinds of questions that you should ask later on when we get</v>

111
00:06:41.481 --> 00:06:42.314
<v Speaker 3>to that stage,</v>

112
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:47.440
<v Speaker 3>but our topic is the rising tide of compelled speech in Canada.</v>

113
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:55.310
<v Speaker 3>I am going to take just a couple of minutes to give us some context and set it</v>

114
00:06:55.311 --> 00:07:00.311
<v Speaker 3>up and then I'll ask Jordan to tell us what he thinks.</v>

115
00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:10.640
<v Speaker 3>You may have seen the CBC production of the tutors.</v>

116
00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.250
<v Speaker 3>The story of King Henry the eighth</v>

117
00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:17.550
<v Speaker 3>in one episode,</v>

118
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.710
<v Speaker 3>the king has condemned Thomas Moore to death</v>

119
00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:29.400
<v Speaker 3>for refusing to say that the king is the head of the Church of England</v>

120
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:35.250
<v Speaker 3>more isn't his cell awaiting execution.</v>

121
00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:42.540
<v Speaker 3>A friend comes to him to plead with him to say what it is the king wants to</v>

122
00:07:44.921 --> 00:07:45.754
<v Speaker 3>hear.</v>

123
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:52.800
<v Speaker 3>Morris says he cannot do that for he does not believe it to be true.</v>

124
00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:55.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

125
00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:56.610
<v Speaker 3>In exasperate</v>

126
00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:00.050
<v Speaker 3>the friends says,</v>

127
00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:04.400
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to believe it.</v>

128
00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:08.610
<v Speaker 3>You just have to say it.</v>

129
00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:15.650
<v Speaker 3>When your brain makes that kind of calculation,</v>

130
00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:21.380
<v Speaker 3>you know you are under the thumb of a tyrant</v>

131
00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:27.230
<v Speaker 3>and Thomas Moore lost his head.</v>

132
00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:33.500
<v Speaker 3>The tide of compelled speech in Canada is rising.</v>

133
00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:40.660
<v Speaker 3>The Law Society of Ontario has introduced a new policy that requires each lawyer</v>

134
00:08:42.291 --> 00:08:47.291
<v Speaker 3>to develop a statement of Principles which endorses and acknowledges an</v>

135
00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:52.430
<v Speaker 3>obligation to promote certain values.</v>

136
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:59.990
<v Speaker 3>The Ontario Human Rights Commission says that under the Human Rights Code,</v>

137
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:06.770
<v Speaker 3>failing to address somebody by their preferred Pronoun will constitute</v>

138
00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:13.610
<v Speaker 3>discrimination for which you may be investigated and prosecuted.</v>

139
00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.980
<v Speaker 3>The Elementary Teachers,</v>

140
00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:22.820
<v Speaker 3>Federation of Ontario has introduced new curriculum</v>

141
00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:29.320
<v Speaker 3>to require teachers to teach elementary students about white privilege</v>

142
00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:37.860
<v Speaker 3>and the Federal Summer Jay Grants Program requires applicants to attest to the</v>

143
00:09:38.741 --> 00:09:39.574
<v Speaker 3>values,</v>

144
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:41.770
<v Speaker 3>but the government believes it.</v>

145
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:44.180
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

146
00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:45.740
<v Speaker 3>They don't have to believe it.</v>

147
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:31.790
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

148
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:51.080
<v Speaker 4>that's pure narcissism at work.</v>

149
00:10:51.081 --> 00:10:51.730
<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>

150
00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:56.730
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

151
00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:11.910
<v Speaker 4>you do to hijack hijacking event like this that other people put time and effort</v>

152
00:11:12.221 --> 00:11:17.221
<v Speaker 4>into and to use the civility of the crowd and the civility of the organizers as</v>

153
00:11:18.761 --> 00:11:21.710
<v Speaker 4>an excuse to blatantly yellow.</v>

154
00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.360
<v Speaker 4>You're ill informed opinions is no way to conduct a civil dialogue.</v>

155
00:11:25.361 --> 00:11:26.650
<v Speaker 4>It's absolutely appalling.</v>

156
00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:27.461
<v Speaker 4>The people who do that,</v>

157
00:11:27.461 --> 00:11:28.294
<v Speaker 4>she'd be embarrassed.</v>

158
00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:38.700
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

159
00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:43.740
<v Speaker 4>I would also say that as students and his faculty members,</v>

160
00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:45.150
<v Speaker 4>you shouldn't put up with it.</v>

161
00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:48.570
<v Speaker 4>There's no way that you should allow people who are doing this to hijack your</v>

162
00:11:48.571 --> 00:11:53.190
<v Speaker 4>educational opportunities and to bend and twist the functions,</v>

163
00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:54.670
<v Speaker 4>the structures of the university.</v>

164
00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.320
<v Speaker 4>It's not a good thing.</v>

165
00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:57.430
<v Speaker 4>Not In any way at all.</v>

166
00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:01.030
<v Speaker 4>He would say that was a very disgraceful display fundamentally.</v>

167
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.320
<v Speaker 4>So let's,</v>

168
00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:03.183
<v Speaker 4>let's stick with it.</v>

169
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:04.503
<v Speaker 4>Why,</v>

170
00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:09.970
<v Speaker 4>why do you think people are afraid of free speech?</v>

171
00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:12.160
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

172
00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:12.993
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

173
00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.570
<v Speaker 4>people develop an ideological view of the world because they don't want to think</v>

174
00:12:16.571 --> 00:12:21.220
<v Speaker 4>through things in real detail and they're aided and embedded in that endeavor by</v>

175
00:12:21.221 --> 00:12:23.860
<v Speaker 4>their pathological professors who were feeding them.</v>

176
00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:24.793
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

177
00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:27.250
<v Speaker 4>what would I say over simplified?</v>

178
00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:32.110
<v Speaker 4>An oversimplified radical view of the world in my estimation,</v>

179
00:12:32.111 --> 00:12:33.510
<v Speaker 4>is fundamentally based in,</v>

180
00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:34.480
<v Speaker 4>in resentment.</v>

181
00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:36.910
<v Speaker 4>Not that there's no reason for say,</v>

182
00:12:36.911 --> 00:12:39.400
<v Speaker 4>a left wing view of the world and we can get to that later.</v>

183
00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:40.670
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

184
00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:41.830
<v Speaker 4>it's easy virtue.</v>

185
00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:42.610
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

186
00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:47.080
<v Speaker 4>you can stand up in front of 900 people with your black card and your and your</v>

187
00:12:47.081 --> 00:12:48.340
<v Speaker 4>screeching and you can,</v>

188
00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:50.740
<v Speaker 4>you can declaim to the entire audience,</v>

189
00:12:50.741 --> 00:12:52.600
<v Speaker 4>your fundamental moral superiority.</v>

190
00:12:52.601 --> 00:12:54.100
<v Speaker 4>You can tell everyone at,</v>

191
00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:57.490
<v Speaker 4>at once that they're all beneath you and you're standing for the right thing.</v>

192
00:12:57.491 --> 00:12:59.410
<v Speaker 4>And absolutely none of that is earned.</v>

193
00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:00.281
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

194
00:13:00.281 --> 00:13:00.461
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

195
00:13:00.461 --> 00:13:00.880
<v Speaker 4>what the hell?</v>

196
00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.020
<v Speaker 4>What the hell was that?</v>

197
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:04.120
<v Speaker 4>There's no seriously man.</v>

198
00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:04.931
<v Speaker 4>There's just,</v>

199
00:13:04.931 --> 00:13:06.520
<v Speaker 4>it's just complete misbehavior.</v>

200
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:07.611
<v Speaker 4>It's embarrassing.</v>

201
00:13:07.611 --> 00:13:11.170
<v Speaker 4>And the fact that the people who do that don't have enough sense to go hide</v>

202
00:13:11.171 --> 00:13:14.350
<v Speaker 4>their head in shame just tells you how badly socialized they are and how</v>

203
00:13:14.351 --> 00:13:15.790
<v Speaker 4>terribly educated they are.</v>

204
00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:16.841
<v Speaker 4>And the thing is,</v>

205
00:13:16.841 --> 00:13:20.650
<v Speaker 4>the thing that's so awful is that there are professors and educators who promote</v>

206
00:13:20.651 --> 00:13:20.921
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

207
00:13:20.921 --> 00:13:21.131
<v Speaker 4>They say,</v>

208
00:13:21.131 --> 00:13:21.281
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

209
00:13:21.281 --> 00:13:22.450
<v Speaker 4>that's how you change the world.</v>

210
00:13:22.451 --> 00:13:23.860
<v Speaker 4>It's like it is how you change the world,</v>

211
00:13:23.861 --> 00:13:25.750
<v Speaker 4>but it's certainly not how you make it better.</v>

212
00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:27.040
<v Speaker 4>You make it worse.</v>

213
00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:28.083
<v Speaker 4>Clearly,</v>

214
00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:29.193
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

215
00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:32.230
<v Speaker 4>there's no comfort and out and there's nothing about it,</v>

216
00:13:32.231 --> 00:13:33.040
<v Speaker 4>this impressive.</v>

217
00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:33.790
<v Speaker 4>It's no,</v>

218
00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:37.210
<v Speaker 4>it's no better in some sense than a two year old having a tantrum on the floor.</v>

219
00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:37.830
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

220
00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:39.850
<v Speaker 4>it shows as far as I'm concerned,</v>

221
00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:42.940
<v Speaker 4>it approximate the same level of psychosocial development.</v>

222
00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:46.180
<v Speaker 4>So when the fact that that this is happening continually,</v>

223
00:13:46.181 --> 00:13:47.110
<v Speaker 4>universities is,</v>

224
00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:48.060
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

225
00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:51.550
<v Speaker 4>it truly makes me embarrassed to be associated with the university.</v>

226
00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:55.630
<v Speaker 4>And now I say that with great displeasure because you know,</v>

227
00:13:55.631 --> 00:13:59.110
<v Speaker 4>I've been working for great universities for a very long time and the university</v>

228
00:13:59.111 --> 00:14:01.450
<v Speaker 4>is an absolutely remarkable institution.</v>

229
00:14:01.451 --> 00:14:01.631
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

230
00:14:01.631 --> 00:14:04.420
<v Speaker 4>it's survived for a thousand years and,</v>

231
00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:05.680
<v Speaker 4>and to see it,</v>

232
00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:07.420
<v Speaker 4>to see it brought down by,</v>

233
00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:11.320
<v Speaker 4>by people whose behavior would be out of place at a four year old's birthday</v>

234
00:14:11.321 --> 00:14:12.154
<v Speaker 4>party is,</v>

235
00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.950
<v Speaker 4>is something something Bizible to behold.</v>

236
00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:16.360
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

237
00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:21.360
<v Speaker 4>so what about the actions of government now because it has government after all</v>

238
00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:26.760
<v Speaker 4>that is the source of this compelled speech as law as well as other ways in</v>

239
00:14:27.131 --> 00:14:28.990
<v Speaker 4>which they seek to restrict speech.</v>

240
00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:33.990
<v Speaker 4>But the compelled speech is the most egregious form of violation of how well</v>

241
00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:35.231
<v Speaker 4>tell us about that.</v>

242
00:14:35.231 --> 00:14:35.411
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

243
00:14:35.411 --> 00:14:36.244
<v Speaker 4>I've been trying,</v>

244
00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:39.340
<v Speaker 4>I've been trying to sort this out because you know,</v>

245
00:14:39.341 --> 00:14:40.360
<v Speaker 4>if you're a clinician,</v>

246
00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:44.500
<v Speaker 4>I would say one of the problems you always have when you're dealing with</v>

247
00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:49.450
<v Speaker 4>behavior that's gone astray is to understand at what level of analysis you</v>

248
00:14:49.451 --> 00:14:50.284
<v Speaker 4>should address it.</v>

249
00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:50.591
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

250
00:14:50.591 --> 00:14:53.000
<v Speaker 4>is it a theological problem?</v>

251
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:54.800
<v Speaker 4>Is it a philosophical problem?</v>

252
00:14:54.801 --> 00:14:56.480
<v Speaker 4>Is it a psychological problem?</v>

253
00:14:56.481 --> 00:14:57.291
<v Speaker 4>Is it social?</v>

254
00:14:57.291 --> 00:14:58.220
<v Speaker 4>Is it economic?</v>

255
00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:00.320
<v Speaker 4>These are very complicated questions.</v>

256
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:01.700
<v Speaker 4>Is it a trivial issue?</v>

257
00:15:01.701 --> 00:15:02.990
<v Speaker 4>Is it an issue of rights?</v>

258
00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:03.311
<v Speaker 4>Is it,</v>

259
00:15:03.311 --> 00:15:04.220
<v Speaker 4>is it something else?</v>

260
00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:08.060
<v Speaker 4>The people who put in the bill see 16 for example,</v>

261
00:15:08.061 --> 00:15:11.600
<v Speaker 4>and its associated legislation make the claim that it's,</v>

262
00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:15.740
<v Speaker 4>it's a legislative womb that's facilitated by nothing but compassion and desire</v>

263
00:15:15.741 --> 00:15:17.320
<v Speaker 4>to expand the domain of,</v>

264
00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:18.060
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

265
00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:19.160
<v Speaker 4>of let's say,</v>

266
00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:20.930
<v Speaker 4>of rights and freedoms.</v>

267
00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:22.010
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

268
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:26.270
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing wrong in principle with expanding the domain of rights and</v>

269
00:15:26.271 --> 00:15:26.780
<v Speaker 4>freedoms,</v>

270
00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:30.680
<v Speaker 4>except of course for every right and for every freedom there's an attendant</v>

271
00:15:30.681 --> 00:15:32.240
<v Speaker 4>responsibility and obligation.</v>

272
00:15:32.241 --> 00:15:33.650
<v Speaker 4>So you have to keep that in mind.</v>

273
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:37.910
<v Speaker 4>When I looked at bill [inaudible] 16 and the legislation that surrounded it,</v>

274
00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.760
<v Speaker 4>especially that was written by the Ontario Human Rights Commission,</v>

275
00:15:40.761 --> 00:15:44.720
<v Speaker 4>the policies that surrounded it and also the policies that gave rise to the</v>

276
00:15:44.721 --> 00:15:48.560
<v Speaker 4>social justice tribunals named social justice tribunals.</v>

277
00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:53.570
<v Speaker 4>Appallingly enough that that that gave rise to those tribunals in Ontario.</v>

278
00:15:53.571 --> 00:15:55.670
<v Speaker 4>The things I read just made my hair stand on end.</v>

279
00:15:55.671 --> 00:15:56.210
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

280
00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:59.780
<v Speaker 4>the social justice tribunals have the right to place themselves outside of</v>

281
00:15:59.781 --> 00:16:00.614
<v Speaker 4>legal,</v>

282
00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:03.110
<v Speaker 4>out of outside of jurors prudential precedence.</v>

283
00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:03.890
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

284
00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:05.130
<v Speaker 4>what the hell is that?</v>

285
00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:07.490
<v Speaker 4>It's really what you're going to make the case.</v>

286
00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:11.210
<v Speaker 4>The only way I think that you could justify doing that is it if you torture</v>

287
00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:16.270
<v Speaker 4>yourself into the ideological proposition that English common law is somehow an</v>

288
00:16:16.881 --> 00:16:18.800
<v Speaker 4>oppressive branch of the patriarchy,</v>

289
00:16:18.801 --> 00:16:23.300
<v Speaker 4>and because of that you have every right and even obligation to place yourself</v>

290
00:16:23.301 --> 00:16:25.430
<v Speaker 4>outside of its structure of precedent.</v>

291
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:26.420
<v Speaker 4>But we don't want to.</v>

292
00:16:26.421 --> 00:16:29.900
<v Speaker 4>Police are so outside of the structure of precedent of English common law.</v>

293
00:16:29.901 --> 00:16:31.290
<v Speaker 4>I can tell you that it's,</v>

294
00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:34.070
<v Speaker 4>it's one of the supreme achievements of the human race.</v>

295
00:16:34.071 --> 00:16:34.520
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

296
00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:38.360
<v Speaker 4>it's produced societies that are as free and as productive as any societies have</v>

297
00:16:38.361 --> 00:16:43.361
<v Speaker 4>ever been anywhere on the planet and certainly are now and to dare to state that</v>

298
00:16:44.571 --> 00:16:47.120
<v Speaker 4>you would place yourself outside of that precedent.</v>

299
00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:49.560
<v Speaker 4>That's the sort of thing that made my hair stand on end.</v>

300
00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:53.480
<v Speaker 4>And there were other elements of the policies that were equally reprehensible,</v>

301
00:16:53.481 --> 00:16:54.201
<v Speaker 4>not least,</v>

302
00:16:54.201 --> 00:16:56.690
<v Speaker 4>their complete incoherence of formulation.</v>

303
00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.290
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

304
00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:58.760
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't understand some of it,</v>

305
00:16:58.761 --> 00:17:00.260
<v Speaker 4>like I don't understand,</v>

306
00:17:00.261 --> 00:17:00.861
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

307
00:17:00.861 --> 00:17:02.390
<v Speaker 4>with regards to the gender,</v>

308
00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:03.240
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

309
00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:03.951
<v Speaker 4>propositions,</v>

310
00:17:03.951 --> 00:17:06.950
<v Speaker 4>how it can be that you can be anywhere on the gender spectrum,</v>

311
00:17:06.951 --> 00:17:07.551
<v Speaker 4>which by the way,</v>

312
00:17:07.551 --> 00:17:11.120
<v Speaker 4>it's not a spectrum technically and it actually matters which words you use.</v>

313
00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:12.350
<v Speaker 4>If you're writing law,</v>

314
00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.930
<v Speaker 4>you can be anywhere or nowhere on that spectrum.</v>

315
00:17:14.931 --> 00:17:18.350
<v Speaker 4>Like I don't know what that means and I don't believe that the people who wrote</v>

316
00:17:18.351 --> 00:17:18.441
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

317
00:17:18.441 --> 00:17:18.561
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

318
00:17:18.561 --> 00:17:22.340
<v Speaker 4>what it means either and you don't write things that you don't understand into</v>

319
00:17:22.341 --> 00:17:23.330
<v Speaker 4>the damn law.</v>

320
00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:28.220
<v Speaker 4>You don't do that because the law unfolds in society and it tangles people up as</v>

321
00:17:28.221 --> 00:17:29.054
<v Speaker 4>it unfolds.</v>

322
00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:30.920
<v Speaker 4>And it's no joke when that happens.</v>

323
00:17:30.921 --> 00:17:31.701
<v Speaker 4>So you'll be very,</v>

324
00:17:31.701 --> 00:17:35.180
<v Speaker 4>very careful when you're writing law and you certainly don't want to write law</v>

325
00:17:35.181 --> 00:17:37.730
<v Speaker 4>to push forward your ideological commitments,</v>

326
00:17:37.731 --> 00:17:42.200
<v Speaker 4>especially in the face of precedent because precedent is what keeps law from</v>

327
00:17:42.201 --> 00:17:44.390
<v Speaker 4>degenerating into audiology essentially.</v>

328
00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:45.390
<v Speaker 4>So and so.</v>

329
00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:46.030
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

330
00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:46.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

331
00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:47.630
<v Speaker 4>Tamtam answer your question,</v>

332
00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:48.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

333
00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:48.960
<v Speaker 4>more,</v>

334
00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:49.320
<v Speaker 4>more,</v>

335
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:50.070
<v Speaker 4>more,</v>

336
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.180
<v Speaker 4>more fundamentally,</v>

337
00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:56.720
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe that this argument has ever been about the rights of transgender</v>

338
00:17:56.851 --> 00:17:57.684
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

339
00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:02.040
<v Speaker 4>I think that it's an attempt by the radical left ideologues to push their</v>

340
00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:04.290
<v Speaker 4>ideological agenda forward using,</v>

341
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:05.303
<v Speaker 4>using,</v>

342
00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:08.340
<v Speaker 4>they're using attempts to manipulate the linguistic domain.</v>

343
00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:11.940
<v Speaker 4>And I'm not willing to seat the loot linguistic domain because I don't think</v>

344
00:18:11.941 --> 00:18:12.750
<v Speaker 4>there are any more,</v>

345
00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:15.810
<v Speaker 4>anything more important than the words that you use.</v>

346
00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.490
<v Speaker 4>And then when the government says we,</v>

347
00:18:17.491 --> 00:18:19.080
<v Speaker 4>you should start using these words.</v>

348
00:18:19.081 --> 00:18:22.830
<v Speaker 4>You should start thinking hard about your damn government because your words are</v>

349
00:18:22.831 --> 00:18:25.320
<v Speaker 4>no different than your thoughts and your thoughts.</v>

350
00:18:25.321 --> 00:18:26.310
<v Speaker 4>Orient Yourself,</v>

351
00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:28.350
<v Speaker 4>your thoughts orient you in the world.</v>

352
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:31.830
<v Speaker 4>And if someone who's going to tell you what it is that you have to think,</v>

353
00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.350
<v Speaker 4>then they're going to disorient you in the world.</v>

354
00:18:34.351 --> 00:18:37.620
<v Speaker 4>And I wouldn't recommend that because there's lots of terrible things that can</v>

355
00:18:37.621 --> 00:18:38.454
<v Speaker 4>happen to you.</v>

356
00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:39.690
<v Speaker 4>And if you're disoriented,</v>

357
00:18:39.691 --> 00:18:42.030
<v Speaker 4>you're going to run into a very large number of them.</v>

358
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:44.010
<v Speaker 4>So that's how it looks to me.</v>

359
00:18:44.011 --> 00:18:44.770
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

360
00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:45.170
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

361
00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:45.860
<v Speaker 4>but the</v>

362
00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:47.960
<v Speaker 3>ideological context of this,</v>

363
00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:50.300
<v Speaker 3>it seems like something has changed.</v>

364
00:18:50.301 --> 00:18:50.511
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

365
00:18:50.511 --> 00:18:54.470
<v Speaker 3>Because if you think back decades earlier,</v>

366
00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:59.030
<v Speaker 3>liberals were the champions of free speech.</v>

367
00:18:59.340 --> 00:18:59.600
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

368
00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:02.660
<v Speaker 3>It was the conservatives at a certain moment in time,</v>

369
00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:04.340
<v Speaker 3>who are the sensors,</v>

370
00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:04.791
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

371
00:19:04.791 --> 00:19:04.951
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

372
00:19:04.951 --> 00:19:05.221
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

373
00:19:05.221 --> 00:19:09.050
<v Speaker 3>they sought to curb a blasphemy and obscenity,</v>

374
00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.540
<v Speaker 3>sedition and so on.</v>

375
00:19:11.541 --> 00:19:11.741
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>

376
00:19:11.741 --> 00:19:13.370
<v Speaker 3>and the Liberals said,</v>

377
00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:13.881
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

378
00:19:13.881 --> 00:19:15.860
<v Speaker 3>free speech is the way we want to go.</v>

379
00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:21.350
<v Speaker 3>And yet today that has flipped a,</v>

380
00:19:21.351 --> 00:19:21.731
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

381
00:19:21.731 --> 00:19:26.731
<v Speaker 3>if you look back to what left leaning officials and authorities and,</v>

382
00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:28.560
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

383
00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.050
<v Speaker 3>and figures said,</v>

384
00:19:30.051 --> 00:19:31.010
<v Speaker 3>lemme just give you one quote.</v>

385
00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:36.040
<v Speaker 3>This is Samuel Gompers who is the founder of the American Federation of Labor in</v>

386
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:42.260
<v Speaker 3>1886 he said this,</v>

387
00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:42.621
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

388
00:19:42.621 --> 00:19:47.600
<v Speaker 3>the freedom of speech has been granted to the people in order that they may say</v>

389
00:19:47.601 --> 00:19:48.710
<v Speaker 3>the things</v>

390
00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:51.133
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

391
00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:52.890
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>

392
00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:56.660
<v Speaker 3>Misquoted that have not been granted to the people in order that they may say</v>

393
00:19:56.661 --> 00:20:01.610
<v Speaker 3>the things which please and which are based upon accepted thought.</v>

394
00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:07.120
<v Speaker 3>But the right to say the things which displease the right to say the things</v>

395
00:20:07.641 --> 00:20:10.850
<v Speaker 3>which may convey the new and yet unexpected thoughts.</v>

396
00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:14.960
<v Speaker 3>The right to say things even though they do a wrong.</v>

397
00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:20.200
<v Speaker 3>Now that is not a sentiment now carried on by the left and today what has</v>

398
00:20:21.441 --> 00:20:22.274
<v Speaker 3>happened?</v>

399
00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:26.310
<v Speaker 4>Well again I see that it's a consequence of continued agitation,</v>

400
00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:30.240
<v Speaker 4>agitation by I would say a minority of of the left,</v>

401
00:20:30.241 --> 00:20:31.770
<v Speaker 4>the radical left in particular.</v>

402
00:20:31.771 --> 00:20:36.771
<v Speaker 4>And those are people who aren't Marxist Slash Neo Marxist in their fundamental</v>

403
00:20:36.961 --> 00:20:41.961
<v Speaker 4>ideological orientation and have joined that in an unholy union with the worst</v>

404
00:20:42.361 --> 00:20:42.871
<v Speaker 4>of French,</v>

405
00:20:42.871 --> 00:20:47.871
<v Speaker 4>postmodernism and and they push it ideological certainty.</v>

406
00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:50.560
<v Speaker 4>And the thing that,</v>

407
00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:54.100
<v Speaker 4>the thing that's really distressing about that is that if you know anything</v>

408
00:20:54.101 --> 00:20:56.320
<v Speaker 4>about the history of oppressed people,</v>

409
00:20:56.321 --> 00:21:00.310
<v Speaker 4>let's say much as I hate to engage in that particular form of dialogue under the</v>

410
00:21:00.311 --> 00:21:01.210
<v Speaker 4>current conditions,</v>

411
00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:05.800
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty obvious that it's freedom of speech is freedom.</v>

412
00:21:05.801 --> 00:21:08.980
<v Speaker 4>That's particularly important for people who don't have anything else.</v>

413
00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:09.681
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

414
00:21:09.681 --> 00:21:13.180
<v Speaker 4>It's if you're supporting freedom of speech are not supporting the status quo.</v>

415
00:21:13.181 --> 00:21:13.391
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

416
00:21:13.391 --> 00:21:14.111
<v Speaker 4>just think about,</v>

417
00:21:14.111 --> 00:21:14.321
<v Speaker 4>let's,</v>

418
00:21:14.321 --> 00:21:18.750
<v Speaker 4>let's use the logic of the radical leftists and assume that society is a</v>

419
00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:22.630
<v Speaker 4>tyrannical hierarchy and the people at the top have the upper hand in everything</v>

420
00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.970
<v Speaker 4>including access to communication.</v>

421
00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:34.520
<v Speaker 4>These people are not your friends.</v>

422
00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:45.603
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

423
00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:50.690
<v Speaker 1>Mark my words.</v>

424
00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:54.380
<v Speaker 1>Now it's the sounds of the barbarians pounding out the gate.</v>

425
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:56.343
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

426
00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:03.633
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

427
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:04.780
<v Speaker 1>That's all.</v>

428
00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:05.613
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you again,</v>

429
00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:09.250
<v Speaker 1>that use of in Kuwait,</v>

430
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:15.550
<v Speaker 4>what would you call it in Kuwait sensation is the best formulation of their</v>

431
00:22:15.551 --> 00:22:16.384
<v Speaker 4>argument.</v>

432
00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:20.080
<v Speaker 4>And there's not much difference between knocking on the doors and knocking on</v>

433
00:22:20.081 --> 00:22:20.914
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

434
00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:22.810
<v Speaker 4>So keep that in mind.</v>

435
00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:24.550
<v Speaker 4>It's not a music,</v>

436
00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:25.780
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing to it,</v>

437
00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:26.920
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing for it.</v>

438
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:31.240
<v Speaker 4>The thing that's also quite appalling is that there's no evidence whatsoever</v>

439
00:22:31.241 --> 00:22:34.390
<v Speaker 4>that the people who are conducting these protests know what it is that they're</v>

440
00:22:34.391 --> 00:22:35.650
<v Speaker 4>protesting against.</v>

441
00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:36.461
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

442
00:22:36.461 --> 00:22:37.294
<v Speaker 4>I was in,</v>

443
00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:46.040
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>

444
00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:46.420
<v Speaker 1>alright.</v>

445
00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:51.420
<v Speaker 4>I was in the midst of a discussion and attempting to make the case that it's</v>

446
00:22:51.491 --> 00:22:52.420
<v Speaker 4>freedom of speech.</v>

447
00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:53.230
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

448
00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:55.900
<v Speaker 4>that is what people who have nothing still have,</v>

449
00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:56.890
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

450
00:22:56.890 --> 00:23:00.310
<v Speaker 4>So if you look at the tyrannical structure of our society,</v>

451
00:23:00.311 --> 00:23:04.240
<v Speaker 4>let's say the people at the top have access to means of communication.</v>

452
00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:08.860
<v Speaker 4>Everyone knows that it's the people at the bottom who have the right to say what</v>

453
00:23:08.861 --> 00:23:09.670
<v Speaker 4>they think,</v>

454
00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:11.320
<v Speaker 4>however badly they say it,</v>

455
00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.500
<v Speaker 4>that enables them to get a toe hold into the system and to,</v>

456
00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:16.780
<v Speaker 4>and to make their suffering known.</v>

457
00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:18.850
<v Speaker 4>That's what freedom of speech is for.</v>

458
00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:21.970
<v Speaker 4>And so like what's the protest against that?</v>

459
00:23:21.971 --> 00:23:22.661
<v Speaker 4>And I'll tell you,</v>

460
00:23:22.661 --> 00:23:25.540
<v Speaker 4>you know the rowdy called Neo Marxists types.</v>

461
00:23:25.541 --> 00:23:29.290
<v Speaker 4>They speak the language of power and that's what they're speaking right now.</v>

462
00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:32.830
<v Speaker 4>And if you want to live in a world where everyone speaks the language of power,</v>

463
00:23:32.831 --> 00:23:36.070
<v Speaker 4>then just let them do what they're doing and see what happens.</v>

464
00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:37.540
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't recommend it.</v>

465
00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:39.010
<v Speaker 4>It's not a pretty rote.</v>

466
00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:40.720
<v Speaker 4>And you're all in a position,</v>

467
00:23:40.721 --> 00:23:43.840
<v Speaker 4>you're on a situation in your life now where you have to make decisions about</v>

468
00:23:43.841 --> 00:23:44.674
<v Speaker 4>this sorts of things.</v>

469
00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:47.810
<v Speaker 4>Like is this the sort of institution that you want this to be?</v>

470
00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:50.020
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>

471
00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:50.800
<v Speaker 3>One of the,</v>

472
00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:51.040
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

473
00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:51.873
<v Speaker 3>one of the</v>

474
00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:57.300
<v Speaker 3>arguments against what you said about the pronouns Yup.</v>

475
00:23:57.550 --> 00:23:58.780
<v Speaker 3>Was that,</v>

476
00:23:58.810 --> 00:23:59.320
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

477
00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:00.280
<v Speaker 3>after all,</v>

478
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.200
<v Speaker 3>all you're being asked to do is to say something that is reasonable.</v>

479
00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:10.060
<v Speaker 3>It's not unreasonable to address somebody by the pronouns that they prefer.</v>

480
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:13.960
<v Speaker 3>And yet,</v>

481
00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:18.520
<v Speaker 3>if you think of any kind of speech which is prescribed,</v>

482
00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:24.360
<v Speaker 3>imagine a statute that said people shall use the words hello and please and</v>

483
00:24:27.731 --> 00:24:30.160
<v Speaker 3>thank you in their conversations.</v>

484
00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:34.180
<v Speaker 3>That statute is untenable.</v>

485
00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:35.223
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

486
00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:37.920
<v Speaker 3>Because it now required there's</v>

487
00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:40.770
<v Speaker 4>people to use certain words in their conversations,</v>

488
00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:44.280
<v Speaker 4>even if those words are reasonable themselves.</v>

489
00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:45.750
<v Speaker 4>So that is not the question.</v>

490
00:24:45.751 --> 00:24:47.400
<v Speaker 4>And it was not your case.</v>

491
00:24:47.401 --> 00:24:50.630
<v Speaker 4>You are making that using a pronoun was unreasonable itself.</v>

492
00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:51.503
<v Speaker 4>Do I have that correct?</v>

493
00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:53.010
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

494
00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:53.843
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

495
00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.110
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

496
00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:58.050
<v Speaker 4>there's a couple of things I'd like to say about that.</v>

497
00:24:59.040 --> 00:24:59.760
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

498
00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:04.760
<v Speaker 4>I looked up the process by which the Ontario government formulated it's</v>

499
00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:09.510
<v Speaker 4>legislation with regards to the pronouns and the consultation process that you</v>

500
00:25:09.511 --> 00:25:13.260
<v Speaker 4>used and the consultation process was deeply flawed.</v>

501
00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:16.290
<v Speaker 4>They contacted activists and say,</v>

502
00:25:16.291 --> 00:25:18.840
<v Speaker 4>let's activists of the Trans Community.</v>

503
00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:19.291
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

504
00:25:19.291 --> 00:25:19.680
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

505
00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:21.870
<v Speaker 4>there's a couple of things I'd like to say about that.</v>

506
00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:24.570
<v Speaker 4>The first is there is no trans community,</v>

507
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:25.581
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

508
00:25:25.581 --> 00:25:28.890
<v Speaker 4>Trans people are as diverse as any other group of people,</v>

509
00:25:28.891 --> 00:25:33.060
<v Speaker 4>and to the idea that somehow because of one of their attributes,</v>

510
00:25:33.061 --> 00:25:35.340
<v Speaker 4>they constitute a homogenous group is a,</v>

511
00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:35.941
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

512
00:25:35.941 --> 00:25:37.720
<v Speaker 4>you'd think that that would be a false with dip,</v>

513
00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:42.730
<v Speaker 4>the people who are concerned about treating groups of people adequately would be</v>

514
00:25:44.041 --> 00:25:44.874
<v Speaker 4>loath to,</v>

515
00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:45.870
<v Speaker 4>to put forward,</v>

516
00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:47.490
<v Speaker 4>but even more importantly,</v>

517
00:25:47.491 --> 00:25:51.810
<v Speaker 4>there's absolutely no evidence whatsoever that the activist types are actually</v>

518
00:25:51.811 --> 00:25:56.040
<v Speaker 4>representatives of any of the communities that they hypothetically activate on</v>

519
00:25:56.041 --> 00:25:56.880
<v Speaker 4>behalf of.</v>

520
00:25:57.390 --> 00:25:58.620
<v Speaker 4>It's like they're not elected,</v>

521
00:25:58.650 --> 00:25:59.790
<v Speaker 4>they're not appointed,</v>

522
00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:01.260
<v Speaker 4>they don't pull,</v>

523
00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:02.400
<v Speaker 4>they do this.</v>

524
00:26:02.401 --> 00:26:02.970
<v Speaker 4>They say,</v>

525
00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:03.803
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

526
00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:04.710
<v Speaker 4>here's a group.</v>

527
00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.620
<v Speaker 4>It's a minority group and it's oppressed.</v>

528
00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:11.490
<v Speaker 4>I'm a member of that group and therefore I stand for the group.</v>

529
00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:12.150
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

530
00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:12.601
<v Speaker 4>actually,</v>

531
00:26:12.601 --> 00:26:12.811
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

532
00:26:12.811 --> 00:26:13.644
<v Speaker 4>you don't.</v>

533
00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.630
<v Speaker 4>You don't stand for your group.</v>

534
00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:17.790
<v Speaker 4>You maybe stand for yourself.</v>

535
00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:18.751
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

536
00:26:18.751 --> 00:26:21.810
<v Speaker 4>I don't stand for men and I don't have to stand for white men.</v>

537
00:26:21.811 --> 00:26:22.230
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>

538
00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:24.690
<v Speaker 4>I'm not entitled to speak on their behalf.</v>

539
00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:30.060
<v Speaker 4>And so the idea that it's the trans community that wanted this is a completely</v>

540
00:26:30.061 --> 00:26:31.380
<v Speaker 4>unsustainable idea.</v>

541
00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:32.610
<v Speaker 4>It's certainly unproven.</v>

542
00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:37.230
<v Speaker 4>I've had like 40 letters from trans people since I started to engage in this,</v>

543
00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:38.723
<v Speaker 4>call it</v>

544
00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:42.120
<v Speaker 4>chaotic battle.</v>

545
00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:46.380
<v Speaker 4>The only one of them was mildly critical of what I was doing.</v>

546
00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:47.693
<v Speaker 4>All the other ones,</v>

547
00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:49.680
<v Speaker 4>there aren't that many trans people,</v>

548
00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:50.490
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

549
00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:52.890
<v Speaker 4>So to get 40 letters is actually quite a few.</v>

550
00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:55.680
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that this is a scientific Paul,</v>

551
00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:59.730
<v Speaker 4>but it's at least as scientific as the process by which the Ontario government</v>

552
00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:03.670
<v Speaker 4>generated it's legislation and I'm not</v>

553
00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:11.760
<v Speaker 1>okay</v>

554
00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.620
<v Speaker 4>and I'm not generating legislation.</v>

555
00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:17.190
<v Speaker 4>And what these people said to a person was,</v>

556
00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:22.970
<v Speaker 4>I didn't ask to be the newest whipping boy for the radical postmodernists.</v>

557
00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:26.610
<v Speaker 4>All it's done is made my life more difficult.</v>

558
00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:27.310
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

559
00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:28.710
<v Speaker 4>that basic letter would say,</v>

560
00:27:28.711 --> 00:27:28.921
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

561
00:27:28.921 --> 00:27:32.340
<v Speaker 4>I'm transitioning from one gender to the other and it's very difficult and I'm</v>

562
00:27:32.341 --> 00:27:34.080
<v Speaker 4>not sure that it's the right thing to do.</v>

563
00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:39.620
<v Speaker 4>And this has made the process spectacularly more difficult on all fronts.</v>

564
00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:44.700
<v Speaker 4>It's like these people don't speak for me.</v>

565
00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:46.530
<v Speaker 4>And just because they say they do,</v>

566
00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:48.150
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't mean they do.</v>

567
00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:53.220
<v Speaker 4>And so the other thing that we seem to have swallowed as a society is this crazy</v>

568
00:27:53.221 --> 00:27:54.054
<v Speaker 4>notion that,</v>

569
00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:54.901
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

570
00:27:54.901 --> 00:27:55.381
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

571
00:27:55.381 --> 00:27:58.290
<v Speaker 4>that we should be portioned up into our different minority groups,</v>

572
00:27:58.291 --> 00:28:00.270
<v Speaker 4>which I think is a return to tribalism,</v>

573
00:28:00.271 --> 00:28:01.830
<v Speaker 4>an unbelievably dangerous,</v>

574
00:28:01.831 --> 00:28:04.380
<v Speaker 4>I can't really think of anything more dangerous than that.</v>

575
00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:09.630
<v Speaker 4>And then we've swallowed the idea that if you identify yourself as a member of a</v>

576
00:28:09.631 --> 00:28:12.360
<v Speaker 4>minority group and then you bring forward a grievance,</v>

577
00:28:12.361 --> 00:28:15.750
<v Speaker 4>you have to be treated as if you're a valid representative of that group.</v>

578
00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:16.500
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

579
00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:17.333
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

580
00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:20.250
<v Speaker 4>why in the world would we do that guilt?</v>

581
00:28:20.251 --> 00:28:25.140
<v Speaker 4>I suppose maybe that's part of it or I think it's mostly guilt.</v>

582
00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.550
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to stand up and say,</v>

583
00:28:26.551 --> 00:28:27.270
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

584
00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:29.970
<v Speaker 4>you know who died and made you king so to speak.</v>

585
00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:31.130
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

586
00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:32.610
<v Speaker 4>And can we,</v>

587
00:28:32.611 --> 00:28:35.190
<v Speaker 4>can we stay on that logic for a moment?</v>

588
00:28:35.191 --> 00:28:36.450
<v Speaker 4>The the idea.</v>

589
00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:37.340
<v Speaker 4>So this,</v>

590
00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:42.340
<v Speaker 4>this compelled speech material seems to insist upon treating people not as</v>

591
00:28:46.411 --> 00:28:47.011
<v Speaker 4>individuals,</v>

592
00:28:47.011 --> 00:28:52.011
<v Speaker 4>but as members of groups do either blame them or to favor them as a member of a</v>

593
00:28:52.891 --> 00:28:53.250
<v Speaker 4>group.</v>

594
00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:55.590
<v Speaker 4>Like we take that logic and extended,</v>

595
00:28:55.680 --> 00:29:00.390
<v Speaker 4>you know that the group identity thing becomes intersectionality where you're</v>

596
00:29:00.391 --> 00:29:02.100
<v Speaker 4>not just blogging to one group,</v>

597
00:29:02.101 --> 00:29:03.660
<v Speaker 4>but you're also abuse characteristics.</v>

598
00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:04.860
<v Speaker 4>Spin that outbursts.</v>

599
00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:05.150
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

600
00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:05.820
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

601
00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:07.500
<v Speaker 4>what is the logic of that?</v>

602
00:29:07.501 --> 00:29:09.030
<v Speaker 4>Where does it lead us to know?</v>

603
00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:09.601
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

604
00:29:09.601 --> 00:29:14.410
<v Speaker 4>so the first thing I would say to everyone in the room is,</v>

605
00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:18.303
<v Speaker 4>I don't think,</v>

606
00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:22.090
<v Speaker 4>and this is why I decided to do what I did right from the beginning,</v>

607
00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:22.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

608
00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:25.270
<v Speaker 4>is that I don't want to play the group identity game.</v>

609
00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:29.770
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to construe the world in those terms and I'm not going to use</v>

610
00:29:29.771 --> 00:29:33.360
<v Speaker 4>terminology that would require me to formulate my thoughts in that manner.</v>

611
00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:37.380
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a terrible catastrophe to divide us all up into our tribal</v>

612
00:29:37.381 --> 00:29:38.214
<v Speaker 4>entities.</v>

613
00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:41.050
<v Speaker 4>Don't see anything positive about that at all.</v>

614
00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:44.140
<v Speaker 4>So I just don't want to go there.</v>

615
00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:45.041
<v Speaker 4>And then second,</v>

616
00:29:45.041 --> 00:29:45.730
<v Speaker 4>I would say,</v>

617
00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:47.290
<v Speaker 4>and maybe this is even more relevant,</v>

618
00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:51.220
<v Speaker 4>you may or may not have heard about intersectionality,</v>

619
00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:54.640
<v Speaker 4>but intersectionality is a new development on the radical left.</v>

620
00:29:54.641 --> 00:29:56.200
<v Speaker 4>And I think it's actually,</v>

621
00:29:57.130 --> 00:30:01.030
<v Speaker 4>if I wasn't so in tandem on serious this and these matters,</v>

622
00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:04.390
<v Speaker 4>I would be constantly laughing about intersectionality.</v>

623
00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:08.440
<v Speaker 4>And the reason for that is that it's the radical left has discovered its own</v>

624
00:30:08.441 --> 00:30:09.520
<v Speaker 4>Achilles heel.</v>

625
00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:10.691
<v Speaker 4>So look,</v>

626
00:30:10.691 --> 00:30:13.390
<v Speaker 4>what's the problem with dividing us up into groups?</v>

627
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:15.063
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

628
00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:15.970
<v Speaker 4>there's many.</v>

629
00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:19.180
<v Speaker 4>And the descent into tribalism is not least among them,</v>

630
00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:20.830
<v Speaker 4>but the next is that,</v>

631
00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:21.873
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

632
00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:24.520
<v Speaker 4>it turns out that we don't fit into one group.</v>

633
00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:25.593
<v Speaker 4>Any of us,</v>

634
00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:27.850
<v Speaker 4>we fit into multiple groups.</v>

635
00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:29.200
<v Speaker 4>And it's not obvious at all.</v>

636
00:30:29.201 --> 00:30:30.760
<v Speaker 4>Which of those groups should take,</v>

637
00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:32.590
<v Speaker 4>should be of paramount importance.</v>

638
00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:33.191
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

639
00:30:33.191 --> 00:30:35.650
<v Speaker 4>there's a racial group and an ethnic ethnic group,</v>

640
00:30:35.651 --> 00:30:38.260
<v Speaker 4>and there's groups of intelligence and there's groups of temperament,</v>

641
00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:39.580
<v Speaker 4>there's groups of attractiveness,</v>

642
00:30:39.581 --> 00:30:43.240
<v Speaker 4>and there's groups of wealth and you can multiply them really indefinitely.</v>

643
00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:47.380
<v Speaker 4>And I do mean indefinitely because you can categorize a finite number of</v>

644
00:30:47.381 --> 00:30:47.891
<v Speaker 4>entities,</v>

645
00:30:47.891 --> 00:30:49.780
<v Speaker 4>a virtually infinite number of ways.</v>

646
00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:52.300
<v Speaker 4>And so the intersection lists discovered this.</v>

647
00:30:52.301 --> 00:30:52.631
<v Speaker 4>They said,</v>

648
00:30:52.631 --> 00:30:52.811
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

649
00:30:52.811 --> 00:30:53.644
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

650
00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:54.041
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

651
00:30:54.041 --> 00:30:55.990
<v Speaker 4>let's say there's Latinos and there's,</v>

652
00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:57.040
<v Speaker 4>and there's Asians.</v>

653
00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:57.461
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

654
00:30:57.461 --> 00:30:58.294
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

655
00:30:58.420 --> 00:30:58.991
<v Speaker 4>well wait a minute.</v>

656
00:30:58.991 --> 00:31:02.500
<v Speaker 4>There's male and female Latinos and there's male and female Asians.</v>

657
00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:03.813
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

658
00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:05.080
<v Speaker 4>so do we treat,</v>

659
00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:08.680
<v Speaker 4>is the division into two enough or do we need a division into four?</v>

660
00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:09.391
<v Speaker 4>Well then,</v>

661
00:31:09.391 --> 00:31:09.551
<v Speaker 4>then,</v>

662
00:31:09.551 --> 00:31:13.420
<v Speaker 4>well then there's socioeconomic class of male and female,</v>

663
00:31:13.421 --> 00:31:15.640
<v Speaker 4>Asians and male and female Latinos.</v>

664
00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:16.660
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

665
00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:20.740
<v Speaker 4>and you can keep fractionating the groups and technically without,</v>

666
00:31:20.741 --> 00:31:20.951
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

667
00:31:20.951 --> 00:31:23.290
<v Speaker 4>and you actually see this happening in real time,</v>

668
00:31:23.291 --> 00:31:24.124
<v Speaker 4>so to speak,</v>

669
00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:25.623
<v Speaker 4>as the,</v>

670
00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:26.621
<v Speaker 4>as the,</v>

671
00:31:26.621 --> 00:31:27.100
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

672
00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:32.100
<v Speaker 4>acronym for the LGBT activists continues to expand really without end and see</v>

673
00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:35.650
<v Speaker 4>what's at the bottom of intersectionality.</v>

674
00:31:35.651 --> 00:31:36.251
<v Speaker 4>And this,</v>

675
00:31:36.251 --> 00:31:36.941
<v Speaker 4>I suspect,</v>

676
00:31:36.941 --> 00:31:40.360
<v Speaker 4>will be discovered eventually by the radical leftists if they get that far as</v>

677
00:31:40.361 --> 00:31:40.810
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

678
00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:43.870
<v Speaker 4>you have to fractionate the groups right down to the individual.</v>

679
00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:47.930
<v Speaker 4>And that's what Western culture discussed in articulated,</v>

680
00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:48.581
<v Speaker 4>discovered in,</v>

681
00:31:48.581 --> 00:31:50.800
<v Speaker 4>articulated over the last 5,000 years.</v>

682
00:31:50.801 --> 00:31:51.490
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

683
00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:51.821
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

684
00:31:51.821 --> 00:31:52.181
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

685
00:31:52.181 --> 00:31:54.520
<v Speaker 4>The group isn't the paramount division.</v>

686
00:31:54.521 --> 00:31:55.331
<v Speaker 4>It's the individual.</v>

687
00:31:55.331 --> 00:31:58.180
<v Speaker 4>Because unless you treat each person like an individual,</v>

688
00:31:58.181 --> 00:32:01.150
<v Speaker 4>you're not taking all the intersections into account.</v>

689
00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:02.830
<v Speaker 4>And so it's extraordinarily,</v>

690
00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:04.870
<v Speaker 4>it's extraordinarily comedic.</v>

691
00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:10.560
<v Speaker 4>But it also isn't as if it's treating everyone as they're an individual,</v>

692
00:32:11.441 --> 00:32:12.490
<v Speaker 4>as if they're an individual,</v>

693
00:32:12.491 --> 00:32:15.640
<v Speaker 4>is an instant solution that will bring us to utopia.</v>

694
00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:16.391
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

695
00:32:16.391 --> 00:32:16.621
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

696
00:32:16.621 --> 00:32:19.180
<v Speaker 4>it's like Winston Churchill said of democracy,</v>

697
00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:19.481
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

698
00:32:19.481 --> 00:32:20.010
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

699
00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:23.680
<v Speaker 4>it's essentially the least terrible approach we have.</v>

700
00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:28.540
<v Speaker 4>An life isn't the sort of problem that is amenable to an instantaneous utopian</v>

701
00:32:28.541 --> 00:32:29.141
<v Speaker 4>solution,</v>

702
00:32:29.141 --> 00:32:34.141
<v Speaker 4>but our best bet is to meet each other with the desire for peace and</v>

703
00:32:34.601 --> 00:32:36.640
<v Speaker 4>productivity on this,</v>

704
00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:41.270
<v Speaker 4>on the stage that enables individual interaction because then we meet soul,</v>

705
00:32:41.271 --> 00:32:41.771
<v Speaker 4>the soul,</v>

706
00:32:41.771 --> 00:32:42.471
<v Speaker 4>so to speak.</v>

707
00:32:42.471 --> 00:32:46.820
<v Speaker 4>And we also meet in a domain that we bear responsibility for as individuals.</v>

708
00:32:46.821 --> 00:32:48.380
<v Speaker 4>And that's also extremely important,</v>

709
00:32:48.381 --> 00:32:48.740
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

710
00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:50.810
<v Speaker 4>You should be responsible for what you say.</v>

711
00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:53.570
<v Speaker 4>You should have to suffer the consequences of what you say,</v>

712
00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:55.610
<v Speaker 4>not least so that you learn.</v>

713
00:32:56.330 --> 00:33:00.230
<v Speaker 4>And so the individual is paramount as far as I'm concerned.</v>

714
00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:03.320
<v Speaker 4>I think that's the fundamental principle of Western civilization.</v>

715
00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:03.890
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

716
00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:07.100
<v Speaker 4>it's not only the west that has come across that discovery,</v>

717
00:33:07.101 --> 00:33:10.150
<v Speaker 4>but I think we've done the best job so far of articulating it.</v>

718
00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:15.320
<v Speaker 4>And so we don't want to lose that because the alternative isn't a multicultural</v>

719
00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:16.213
<v Speaker 4>utopia.</v>

720
00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:19.310
<v Speaker 4>The alternative is a descent into tribal barbarism.</v>

721
00:33:19.311 --> 00:33:20.144
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

722
00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:23.510
<v Speaker 4>and there are people who would be just as happy if that happened.</v>

723
00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:28.060
<v Speaker 4>But I would suggest that it's not a destiny that in a weak person would,</v>

724
00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:29.513
<v Speaker 5>would,</v>

725
00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:30.610
<v Speaker 5>would long for.</v>

726
00:33:30.970 --> 00:33:31.803
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

727
00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:35.020
<v Speaker 5>Do you feel like taking a few questions,</v>

728
00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:39.050
<v Speaker 5>do you feel like taking some questions from the storage shirt?</v>

729
00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:39.581
<v Speaker 5>All right,</v>

730
00:33:39.581 --> 00:33:42.910
<v Speaker 5>so we're going to have questions and we'd like you to participate in this</v>

731
00:33:42.911 --> 00:33:45.160
<v Speaker 5>conversation now.</v>

732
00:33:47.530 --> 00:33:49.870
<v Speaker 5>Please do ask a question.</v>

733
00:33:49.871 --> 00:33:53.530
<v Speaker 5>We welcome you up to say what you'd like.</v>

734
00:33:53.650 --> 00:33:58.650
<v Speaker 5>If there is a preamble to the question that's fairly shorts then so be it.</v>

735
00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:01.930
<v Speaker 5>But please do ask a question.</v>

736
00:34:01.931 --> 00:34:04.810
<v Speaker 5>We're not actually in buddy speeches and we do primarily want to hear,</v>

737
00:34:04.811 --> 00:34:05.920
<v Speaker 5>but Jordan has to say,</v>

738
00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:09.670
<v Speaker 5>so feel free to line up at the two microphones.</v>

739
00:34:09.671 --> 00:34:11.470
<v Speaker 5>We'll take one at a time.</v>

740
00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:12.873
<v Speaker 5>Go ahead sir.</v>

741
00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:14.071
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

742
00:34:14.071 --> 00:34:14.940
<v Speaker 6>so first of all,</v>

743
00:34:14.941 --> 00:34:16.080
<v Speaker 6>thank you so much for being here.</v>

744
00:34:16.081 --> 00:34:16.920
<v Speaker 6>I really enjoyed it.</v>

745
00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:17.843
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

746
00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:24.060
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

747
00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:27.330
<v Speaker 6>and a second,</v>

748
00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:28.193
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>

749
00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:29.610
<v Speaker 6>this ties into my question.</v>

750
00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:33.990
<v Speaker 6>I just last week my free speech coalition at Bishop's University was officially</v>

751
00:34:33.991 --> 00:34:37.440
<v Speaker 6>ratified and I would love to invite you to be our first guest speaker,</v>

752
00:34:37.441 --> 00:34:38.550
<v Speaker 6>if that's at all possible.</v>

753
00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:40.363
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

754
00:34:41.170 --> 00:34:41.800
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

755
00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:42.633
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

756
00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:44.220
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

757
00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:44.640
<v Speaker 6>and my,</v>

758
00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:46.380
<v Speaker 6>my question pertains to this,</v>

759
00:34:46.381 --> 00:34:46.830
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

760
00:34:46.830 --> 00:34:47.850
<v Speaker 6>for Dr. Peterson,</v>

761
00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:51.450
<v Speaker 6>what would you consider the most under discussed or,</v>

762
00:34:51.730 --> 00:34:52.260
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

763
00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:57.180
<v Speaker 6>overlooked ideas and topics that you think should be discussed in the club?</v>

764
00:34:57.210 --> 00:35:00.990
<v Speaker 6>Because I know we're looking for controversial ideas that we think are maybe not</v>

765
00:35:00.991 --> 00:35:02.370
<v Speaker 6>as discussed as much as they should be.</v>

766
00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:05.653
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

767
00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:06.801
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

768
00:35:06.801 --> 00:35:07.010
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

769
00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:08.450
<v Speaker 4>that's a difficult question.</v>

770
00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:09.680
<v Speaker 4>I would say that</v>

771
00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:17.390
<v Speaker 4>it isn't obvious to me that on university campuses at the present time or in the</v>

772
00:35:17.391 --> 00:35:18.980
<v Speaker 4>education system in general,</v>

773
00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:24.110
<v Speaker 4>we've done a good job of taking stock of the advantages and disadvantages of our</v>

774
00:35:24.111 --> 00:35:27.290
<v Speaker 4>current sociopolitical systems now.</v>

775
00:35:27.291 --> 00:35:31.040
<v Speaker 4>And I think there's enough data so that we could start having intelligent</v>

776
00:35:31.041 --> 00:35:31.791
<v Speaker 4>conversation.</v>

777
00:35:31.791 --> 00:35:36.500
<v Speaker 4>So one thing I would recommend to you all if you're interested is a book I just</v>

778
00:35:36.501 --> 00:35:37.334
<v Speaker 4>finished reading.</v>

779
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:39.840
<v Speaker 4>It's called the great leveler,</v>

780
00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:42.780
<v Speaker 4>the great leveler by Walter Shy Dale.</v>

781
00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:47.760
<v Speaker 4>And it's a discussion of inequality and it's a very intelligent book.</v>

782
00:35:47.761 --> 00:35:48.400
<v Speaker 4>So one of,</v>

783
00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:49.440
<v Speaker 4>so inequality,</v>

784
00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:51.390
<v Speaker 4>as you may or may not know,</v>

785
00:35:51.391 --> 00:35:54.120
<v Speaker 4>is rife throughout human societies,</v>

786
00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:54.420
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

787
00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:56.280
<v Speaker 4>And that's the case in the present day.</v>

788
00:35:56.281 --> 00:35:57.960
<v Speaker 4>And it's been the case historically,</v>

789
00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:01.260
<v Speaker 4>but it's also the case in animal societies by every measure.</v>

790
00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:03.810
<v Speaker 4>So inequality is the rule of life,</v>

791
00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:04.673
<v Speaker 4>let's say.</v>

792
00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:07.470
<v Speaker 4>And that doesn't mean it's not an ethical catastrophe.</v>

793
00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:08.610
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that,</v>

794
00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:14.240
<v Speaker 4>I'm just saying that the fact of inequality cannot be laid at the feet of the</v>

795
00:36:14.311 --> 00:36:15.960
<v Speaker 4>west or of capitalism or,</v>

796
00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:18.480
<v Speaker 4>or really have any human construction for that matter.</v>

797
00:36:18.481 --> 00:36:23.010
<v Speaker 4>One of the things Shydel did was to investigate empirically the relationship</v>

798
00:36:23.011 --> 00:36:26.250
<v Speaker 4>between inequality and the pole of government.</v>

799
00:36:26.251 --> 00:36:28.020
<v Speaker 4>So because let's say if you,</v>

800
00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:31.440
<v Speaker 4>if you surveyed a very large number of states,</v>

801
00:36:31.441 --> 00:36:35.010
<v Speaker 4>you could determine whether this,</v>

802
00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:37.500
<v Speaker 4>the governments were left wing or right wing and then you could,</v>

803
00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:42.920
<v Speaker 4>you could do a compilation of inequality coefficients and you could find out if</v>

804
00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:45.210
<v Speaker 4>left wing governments had any,</v>

805
00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:48.270
<v Speaker 4>any ability to ameliorate inequality.</v>

806
00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:49.680
<v Speaker 4>Just as an empirical question.</v>

807
00:36:49.681 --> 00:36:52.140
<v Speaker 4>And the answer that Shydel generated was no,</v>

808
00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:55.680
<v Speaker 4>there's no difference whatsoever in the inequality coefficients and left and</v>

809
00:36:55.681 --> 00:36:56.610
<v Speaker 4>right wing states.</v>

810
00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:59.880
<v Speaker 4>And what that points to is a much more fundamental problem.</v>

811
00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:04.590
<v Speaker 4>And Shydel in his book also points out that the only known historical forces</v>

812
00:37:04.591 --> 00:37:09.300
<v Speaker 4>that limit inequality or that produce inequality are war revolution and</v>

813
00:37:09.301 --> 00:37:10.140
<v Speaker 4>pestilence.</v>

814
00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:12.930
<v Speaker 4>It's doesn't look like it's easily under,</v>

815
00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:14.130
<v Speaker 4>under human control.</v>

816
00:37:14.131 --> 00:37:14.760
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

817
00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:15.001
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

818
00:37:15.001 --> 00:37:18.840
<v Speaker 4>the Marxists talked about inequality and the fact that capital tends to</v>

819
00:37:18.841 --> 00:37:21.000
<v Speaker 4>accumulate in the hands of fewer and fewer people,</v>

820
00:37:21.001 --> 00:37:22.080
<v Speaker 4>which is sort of true,</v>

821
00:37:22.081 --> 00:37:26.100
<v Speaker 4>except that the people at the top tend to rotate lot more quickly than that.</v>

822
00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:28.890
<v Speaker 4>Then the communists in the Marxist separate presumed,</v>

823
00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:32.400
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't look like that's a consequence of capitalism.</v>

824
00:37:32.401 --> 00:37:36.030
<v Speaker 4>It looks like it's a much deeper process and capitalism at least,</v>

825
00:37:36.031 --> 00:37:36.331
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

826
00:37:36.331 --> 00:37:41.331
<v Speaker 4>it's shoveling money and resources up to the top also does lift the bottom very,</v>

827
00:37:42.121 --> 00:37:42.990
<v Speaker 4>very quickly.</v>

828
00:37:42.991 --> 00:37:43.530
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

829
00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:46.200
<v Speaker 4>and this is something we need to have a serious discussion about it in the</v>

830
00:37:46.201 --> 00:37:46.741
<v Speaker 4>university.</v>

831
00:37:46.741 --> 00:37:47.910
<v Speaker 4>So like one,</v>

832
00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:49.440
<v Speaker 4>because we shouldn't be doing this,</v>

833
00:37:49.441 --> 00:37:51.150
<v Speaker 4>we should be partying in the streets.</v>

834
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:55.470
<v Speaker 4>And here's one reason why do you know that the level of absolute poverty in the</v>

835
00:37:55.471 --> 00:38:00.471
<v Speaker 4>world fell by 50% between the year 2000 and the year 2012 do you know that was</v>

836
00:38:00.871 --> 00:38:05.460
<v Speaker 4>three years faster than the most optimistic UN projection considered.</v>

837
00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:09.270
<v Speaker 4>It was the fastest decline in absolute poverty that the world has ever seen.</v>

838
00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:11.280
<v Speaker 4>And like that's a big deal.</v>

839
00:38:11.281 --> 00:38:12.114
<v Speaker 4>You know about,</v>

840
00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:15.090
<v Speaker 4>there's hundreds of thousands of people a week right now that are being</v>

841
00:38:15.091 --> 00:38:18.930
<v Speaker 4>connected to the power grid and almost everybody has access to high speed</v>

842
00:38:18.931 --> 00:38:19.800
<v Speaker 4>computation.</v>

843
00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:20.720
<v Speaker 4>And the,</v>

844
00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:21.080
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

845
00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:21.390
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

846
00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:25.230
<v Speaker 4>the struggling economies in Africa have for the last four years being the</v>

847
00:38:25.231 --> 00:38:27.360
<v Speaker 4>fastest growing economies in the world.</v>

848
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:27.781
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

849
00:38:27.781 --> 00:38:30.180
<v Speaker 4>there's almost no absolute privation left.</v>

850
00:38:30.181 --> 00:38:33.060
<v Speaker 4>There aren't people starving except for political reasons.</v>

851
00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:35.350
<v Speaker 4>We're at a point where obesity is the worst,</v>

852
00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:37.030
<v Speaker 4>worst problem than starvation,</v>

853
00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:38.351
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

854
00:38:38.351 --> 00:38:38.900
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

855
00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:42.340
<v Speaker 4>and now I also think that a lot of that was purchased out,</v>

856
00:38:42.341 --> 00:38:43.240
<v Speaker 4>the cost of the,</v>

857
00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:46.870
<v Speaker 4>of the dreams and hopes of the working class in the west.</v>

858
00:38:46.871 --> 00:38:47.051
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

859
00:38:47.051 --> 00:38:50.830
<v Speaker 4>I think what we did some sense for about a 30 year period is sacrificed the</v>

860
00:38:50.831 --> 00:38:54.750
<v Speaker 4>aspirations of the Western working class to alleviate poverty,</v>

861
00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:57.190
<v Speaker 4>get India and China and in South East Asia.</v>

862
00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:59.560
<v Speaker 4>And it looks like that might have been a really good deal,</v>

863
00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:02.890
<v Speaker 4>although it was a little bit hard on the working class people and that has to be</v>

864
00:39:02.891 --> 00:39:03.820
<v Speaker 4>taken into account,</v>

865
00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:07.000
<v Speaker 4>but we're not having discussions of is sort universities.</v>

866
00:39:07.001 --> 00:39:12.001
<v Speaker 4>It's like we're stuck in 1980 or maybe a 1960 we haven't updated our bottles.</v>

867
00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:16.930
<v Speaker 4>We take into account the new and often extraordinarily positive realities and</v>

868
00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:19.870
<v Speaker 4>we're tearing ourselves apart in the west with this identity,</v>

869
00:39:19.871 --> 00:39:20.411
<v Speaker 4>politics,</v>

870
00:39:20.411 --> 00:39:20.891
<v Speaker 4>idiocy.</v>

871
00:39:20.891 --> 00:39:21.820
<v Speaker 4>At the same time,</v>

872
00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:23.460
<v Speaker 4>the things are getting better and better,</v>

873
00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:27.160
<v Speaker 4>faster and faster than they ever have by a huge margin in the history of</v>

874
00:39:27.161 --> 00:39:27.994
<v Speaker 4>mankind.</v>

875
00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:29.223
<v Speaker 4>So it's like,</v>

876
00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:34.090
<v Speaker 4>it's time to wake up and throw off the depression of the Cold War and,</v>

877
00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:34.820
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

878
00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:35.380
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

879
00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:39.010
<v Speaker 4>and to look around and see what's what's available in front of us and what we</v>

880
00:39:39.011 --> 00:39:42.040
<v Speaker 4>could accomplish that would be much better than Oh,</v>

881
00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:42.850
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

882
00:39:42.850 --> 00:39:43.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

883
00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:44.073
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

884
00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:53.640
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

885
00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:54.270
<v Speaker 4>Told that,</v>

886
00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:54.960
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

887
00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:56.310
<v Speaker 4>there are developments outside.</v>

888
00:39:56.311 --> 00:39:57.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry for the noise.</v>

889
00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:57.701
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

890
00:39:57.701 --> 00:39:57.980
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

891
00:39:57.980 --> 00:39:58.920
<v Speaker 4>we'll will,</v>

892
00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:00.100
<v Speaker 4>they're doing the best they can.</v>

893
00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:01.090
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

894
00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:01.923
<v Speaker 4>yes ma'am.</v>

895
00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:07.560
<v Speaker 1>Was there a fetus in youth said that Europe had one was one of your highest</v>

896
00:40:07.770 --> 00:40:09.730
<v Speaker 1>priorities is the pursuit of truth?</v>

897
00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:12.870
<v Speaker 1>Could you just clarify what Ruth,</v>

898
00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:16.030
<v Speaker 1>you mean when you're presented with a situation where you have to,</v>

899
00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:21.250
<v Speaker 1>or you're being asked to refer to someone to their preferred pronouns,</v>

900
00:40:21.251 --> 00:40:21.790
<v Speaker 1>and is it,</v>

901
00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:25.030
<v Speaker 1>is it a truth they do see is that their truth is your truth</v>

902
00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:28.330
<v Speaker 1>be the issue</v>

903
00:40:28.770 --> 00:40:32.490
<v Speaker 4>isn't the request of the individual to be addressed in a certain matter.</v>

904
00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:36.570
<v Speaker 4>It's the compulsion of that by law.</v>

905
00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:40.740
<v Speaker 4>So at least issues get conflated constantly.</v>

906
00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:41.491
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

907
00:40:41.491 --> 00:40:43.410
<v Speaker 4>I've dealt with all sorts of people in my life,</v>

908
00:40:43.830 --> 00:40:47.820
<v Speaker 4>a much broader range of people than most people ever encounter in the course of</v>

909
00:40:47.821 --> 00:40:48.800
<v Speaker 4>their entire lives.</v>

910
00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:53.400
<v Speaker 4>And I'm perfectly capable of deciding how to treat someone on a one to one</v>

911
00:40:53.401 --> 00:40:54.234
<v Speaker 4>basis.</v>

912
00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:56.070
<v Speaker 4>But when the demand for,</v>

913
00:40:56.130 --> 00:40:58.800
<v Speaker 4>for terminology becomes part of the legal system,</v>

914
00:40:58.801 --> 00:41:00.780
<v Speaker 4>I don't care what the rationale is.</v>

915
00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:03.150
<v Speaker 4>It's not happening as far as I'm concerned.</v>

916
00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:04.381
<v Speaker 4>And people say,</v>

917
00:41:04.381 --> 00:41:05.070
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

918
00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:06.990
<v Speaker 4>we're pushing it forward because of compassion.</v>

919
00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:09.990
<v Speaker 4>And maybe you could stop just being such a mean professor.</v>

920
00:41:09.991 --> 00:41:10.590
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

921
00:41:10.590 --> 00:41:11.910
<v Speaker 4>why should I believe that?</v>

922
00:41:11.911 --> 00:41:15.360
<v Speaker 4>You know what the hell you're doing with your compelling laws.</v>

923
00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:16.463
<v Speaker 4>You're willing to,</v>

924
00:41:16.650 --> 00:41:20.700
<v Speaker 4>you're willing to move past illegal wine in the sand that's been drawn for let's</v>

925
00:41:20.701 --> 00:41:20.890
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

926
00:41:20.890 --> 00:41:22.170
<v Speaker 4>700 years.</v>

927
00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:26.250
<v Speaker 4>You do not write compelled speech into the legislation all but we're doing it</v>

928
00:41:26.251 --> 00:41:27.600
<v Speaker 4>with the best of intense.</v>

929
00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:28.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

930
00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:28.651
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

931
00:41:28.651 --> 00:41:29.550
<v Speaker 4>you're not.</v>

932
00:41:30.450 --> 00:41:33.150
<v Speaker 4>So these issues have to be separate.</v>

933
00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:33.591
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

934
00:41:33.591 --> 00:41:35.960
<v Speaker 4>if this was about transgender rights,</v>

935
00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:41.740
<v Speaker 4>it would have disappeared in September of 2016 it's not about transgender rights</v>

936
00:41:42.021 --> 00:41:42.920
<v Speaker 4>and everyone knows it.</v>

937
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:45.860
<v Speaker 4>So this is not about transgender rights.</v>

938
00:41:45.861 --> 00:41:46.370
<v Speaker 4>What these,</v>

939
00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:47.960
<v Speaker 4>what these people are doing outside.</v>

940
00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:50.180
<v Speaker 4>It's about something far deeper than that.</v>

941
00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:53.270
<v Speaker 4>We ask the question this way.</v>

942
00:41:53.330 --> 00:41:54.163
<v Speaker 4>Can we say,</v>

943
00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:55.453
<v Speaker 4>don't</v>

944
00:41:56.570 --> 00:41:57.650
<v Speaker 4>have the rights,</v>

945
00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:01.700
<v Speaker 4>the liberty to decide how to present themselves.</v>

946
00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:05.390
<v Speaker 4>You know how to be who they want to be,</v>

947
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:06.920
<v Speaker 4>what's aware.</v>

948
00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:07.641
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

949
00:42:07.641 --> 00:42:07.851
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

950
00:42:07.851 --> 00:42:09.440
<v Speaker 4>what gender to call themselves.</v>

951
00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:10.640
<v Speaker 4>And the answer is yes.</v>

952
00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:13.820
<v Speaker 4>Everybody has the liberty to do that.</v>

953
00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:17.420
<v Speaker 4>What everybody else has liberty too.</v>

954
00:42:18.410 --> 00:42:21.770
<v Speaker 4>And the liberty to do that doesn't mean they have the right to compel other</v>

955
00:42:21.771 --> 00:42:22.850
<v Speaker 4>people to agree with it.</v>

956
00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:24.081
<v Speaker 4>In other words,</v>

957
00:42:24.081 --> 00:42:28.970
<v Speaker 4>liberty is not the right to demand that the world validate the choices that</v>

958
00:42:28.971 --> 00:42:29.720
<v Speaker 4>you've made.</v>

959
00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:30.770
<v Speaker 4>You have your choices,</v>

960
00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:34.640
<v Speaker 4>you have the freedom to make the choices and everybody else has the freedom to</v>

961
00:42:34.641 --> 00:42:38.240
<v Speaker 4>make their choices too and to approve or disapprove and they call you this or</v>

962
00:42:38.241 --> 00:42:39.110
<v Speaker 4>like all your that.</v>

963
00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:40.063
<v Speaker 4>In other words,</v>

964
00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:43.010
<v Speaker 4>liberty is a two way street and everybody has it.</v>

965
00:42:43.011 --> 00:42:44.540
<v Speaker 4>And the fact that you've made choices,</v>

966
00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:47.810
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't mean everybody else doesn't have the same ability to make the same</v>

967
00:42:47.811 --> 00:42:48.644
<v Speaker 4>choices</v>

968
00:42:58.860 --> 00:42:59.490
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

969
00:42:59.490 --> 00:42:59.701
<v Speaker 6>Mike,</v>

970
00:42:59.701 --> 00:43:00.534
<v Speaker 6>Please go ahead.</v>

971
00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:01.060
<v Speaker 6>Hi.</v>

972
00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:01.893
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

973
00:43:02.070 --> 00:43:02.730
<v Speaker 6>that was loud.</v>

974
00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:04.260
<v Speaker 6>I just want to thank you for being here.</v>

975
00:43:04.261 --> 00:43:06.120
<v Speaker 6>I'm really big fan and um,</v>

976
00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:09.050
<v Speaker 6>I have a bad habit of making or,</v>

977
00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:09.600
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

978
00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:13.590
<v Speaker 6>getting in arguments with a lot of radical leftists and I'm the most common</v>

979
00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:15.090
<v Speaker 6>argument they present to me,</v>

980
00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:20.160
<v Speaker 6>I generally is bills you 16 only covers the Ontario human rights code.</v>

981
00:43:20.161 --> 00:43:23.130
<v Speaker 6>So those are protected areas under the Ontario Human Rights Code,</v>

982
00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:23.641
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

983
00:43:23.641 --> 00:43:24.474
<v Speaker 6>such as,</v>

984
00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:24.631
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

985
00:43:24.631 --> 00:43:25.620
<v Speaker 6>universities,</v>

986
00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:25.831
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

987
00:43:25.831 --> 00:43:26.610
<v Speaker 6>elementary schools,</v>

988
00:43:26.610 --> 00:43:27.443
<v Speaker 6>et cetera.</v>

989
00:43:27.570 --> 00:43:28.500
<v Speaker 6>I was just wondering,</v>

990
00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:29.190
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

991
00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:31.260
<v Speaker 6>how you would combat this argument.</v>

992
00:43:31.261 --> 00:43:33.480
<v Speaker 6>Seeing is their argument is generally,</v>

993
00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:34.560
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

994
00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:38.480
<v Speaker 6>they're only dealing with vulnerable groups such as young students and um,</v>

995
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:40.060
<v Speaker 6>he's still got about enough.</v>

996
00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:41.311
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter.</v>

997
00:43:41.311 --> 00:43:41.671
<v Speaker 4>They say,</v>

998
00:43:41.671 --> 00:43:42.240
<v Speaker 4>well it's,</v>

999
00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:43.710
<v Speaker 4>it's restricted in scope.</v>

1000
00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:43.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1001
00:43:43.870 --> 00:43:45.240
<v Speaker 4>It's not restricted enough.</v>

1002
00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:46.393
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

1003
00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:49.250
<v Speaker 4>here's a couple of facts.</v>

1004
00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:50.330
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1005
00:43:50.330 --> 00:43:54.480
<v Speaker 4>So when I first made my video is about bill [inaudible] 16,</v>

1006
00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:59.310
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that I suggested was that the act of making the video itself</v>

1007
00:43:59.311 --> 00:44:01.080
<v Speaker 4>could well have been illegal.</v>

1008
00:44:01.770 --> 00:44:06.390
<v Speaker 4>And of course people immediately accused me of fear mongering and perhaps with</v>

1009
00:44:06.391 --> 00:44:06.960
<v Speaker 4>reasons,</v>

1010
00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:10.740
<v Speaker 4>it's not always easy to understand the full intent of the new piece of</v>

1011
00:44:10.741 --> 00:44:12.660
<v Speaker 4>legislation surrounding policies.</v>

1012
00:44:12.690 --> 00:44:14.040
<v Speaker 4>But I can tell you one thing.</v>

1013
00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:18.720
<v Speaker 4>When the lawyers at the University of Toronto read through the new legislation</v>

1014
00:44:18.721 --> 00:44:20.010
<v Speaker 4>and the surrounding policies,</v>

1015
00:44:20.011 --> 00:44:23.910
<v Speaker 4>they also decided that what I was doing might've been transgressing the law.</v>

1016
00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:27.250
<v Speaker 4>And that's why they wrote me two letters telling me to stop.</v>

1017
00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:28.740
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1018
00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:30.660
<v Speaker 4>So that's number one.</v>

1019
00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:31.710
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1020
00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:32.190
<v Speaker 4>fact</v>

1021
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:33.023
<v Speaker 7>number two,</v>

1022
00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:34.680
<v Speaker 7>two words,</v>

1023
00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:36.840
<v Speaker 7>Lindsay Shepherd.</v>

1024
00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:45.890
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1025
00:44:45.890 --> 00:44:46.723
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

1026
00:44:47.650 --> 00:44:50.290
<v Speaker 7>let's say for the argument that I'm a paranoid,</v>

1027
00:44:50.291 --> 00:44:53.590
<v Speaker 7>make a little maniac and that I'm a bigot and all of the other things that</v>

1028
00:44:53.591 --> 00:44:56.260
<v Speaker 7>people have decided that I might be okay.</v>

1029
00:44:56.261 --> 00:44:56.441
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1030
00:44:56.441 --> 00:44:57.221
<v Speaker 7>I'll tell you what,</v>

1031
00:44:57.221 --> 00:45:00.130
<v Speaker 7>in my paranoid Megalomania,</v>

1032
00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:04.090
<v Speaker 7>I never envisioned a situation where a teaching assistant,</v>

1033
00:45:04.091 --> 00:45:08.800
<v Speaker 7>a 22 year old teaching assistant at a major Canadian university would be hold in</v>

1034
00:45:08.801 --> 00:45:13.801
<v Speaker 7>front of a quasi myo is inquisition and have to record it because she dared to</v>

1035
00:45:14.741 --> 00:45:19.741
<v Speaker 7>show five minutes of a video from a mainstream news program run by public</v>

1036
00:45:21.101 --> 00:45:23.710
<v Speaker 7>television funded by the government of Ontario.</v>

1037
00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:26.470
<v Speaker 7>So paranoid as I was,</v>

1038
00:45:26.530 --> 00:45:27.370
<v Speaker 7>let's say,</v>

1039
00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:30.490
<v Speaker 7>it isn't obvious that I was paranoid enough.</v>

1040
00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:32.200
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

1041
00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:33.160
<v Speaker 7>and I don't see that.</v>

1042
00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:37.840
<v Speaker 7>I don't see how either of those examples can be disputed.</v>

1043
00:45:38.050 --> 00:45:38.291
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

1044
00:45:38.291 --> 00:45:41.950
<v Speaker 7>it wasn't like the University of Toronto wrote me two letters without thinking</v>

1045
00:45:41.951 --> 00:45:42.784
<v Speaker 7>about it.</v>

1046
00:45:42.850 --> 00:45:46.960
<v Speaker 7>They went and consulted their high powered lawyers and the lawyers reviewed the</v>

1047
00:45:46.961 --> 00:45:48.910
<v Speaker 7>policies and the legislation and they thought,</v>

1048
00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:49.211
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

1049
00:45:49.211 --> 00:45:50.110
<v Speaker 7>Dr. Peterson,</v>

1050
00:45:50.111 --> 00:45:52.300
<v Speaker 7>he might be contravening that legislation.</v>

1051
00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:53.200
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

1052
00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:57.100
<v Speaker 7>it was a weird paradoxical gift to me that they sent out those two letters</v>

1053
00:45:57.101 --> 00:46:00.640
<v Speaker 7>telling me to stop because it was instant proof that what I was doing was,</v>

1054
00:46:01.210 --> 00:46:02.043
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

1055
00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:05.170
<v Speaker 7>I wouldn't say right because God only knows about that.</v>

1056
00:46:05.410 --> 00:46:10.410
<v Speaker 7>But at least if my interpretation of the bill and its intent was correct,</v>

1057
00:46:11.470 --> 00:46:13.870
<v Speaker 7>so can we just make this observation that,</v>

1058
00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:14.530
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>

1059
00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:19.270
<v Speaker 7>that response to Jordan's critique of see 16,</v>

1060
00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:20.193
<v Speaker 7>the one that went,</v>

1061
00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:20.741
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

1062
00:46:20.741 --> 00:46:21.880
<v Speaker 7>he's overreacting.</v>

1063
00:46:22.270 --> 00:46:25.150
<v Speaker 7>Nobody's going to be punished or sent to jail for this</v>

1064
00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:26.613
<v Speaker 5>silly.</v>

1065
00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:27.491
<v Speaker 5>In this sense,</v>

1066
00:46:27.491 --> 00:46:28.324
<v Speaker 5>remember,</v>

1067
00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:31.390
<v Speaker 5>every single legal rule there is,</v>

1068
00:46:32.050 --> 00:46:37.050
<v Speaker 5>is a legal rule only because it is backed with the mum.</v>

1069
00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:39.490
<v Speaker 5>Monopolistic violence of the state.</v>

1070
00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:40.550
<v Speaker 5>They're ready.</v>

1071
00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:45.550
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

1072
00:46:49.350 --> 00:46:51.270
<v Speaker 5>there's no such thing as a rural without punishment.</v>

1073
00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:51.990
<v Speaker 5>So if,</v>

1074
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:52.920
<v Speaker 5>if for example,</v>

1075
00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:55.500
<v Speaker 5>there's a no parking sign,</v>

1076
00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:57.030
<v Speaker 5>what the practicing science says,</v>

1077
00:46:57.031 --> 00:46:57.870
<v Speaker 5>oh by the way,</v>

1078
00:46:58.380 --> 00:46:59.400
<v Speaker 5>please don't park here.</v>

1079
00:46:59.401 --> 00:47:01.020
<v Speaker 5>But there are no tickets.</v>

1080
00:47:01.290 --> 00:47:04.320
<v Speaker 5>Well people are going to park cause that's not really a rule.</v>

1081
00:47:04.830 --> 00:47:08.670
<v Speaker 5>So if you have a rule in the human rights code and if you breach it,</v>

1082
00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:10.050
<v Speaker 5>if that's discrimination,</v>

1083
00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:11.880
<v Speaker 5>well then true.</v>

1084
00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:15.480
<v Speaker 5>The first thing that happens to you is not going to be thrown in jail.</v>

1085
00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:17.730
<v Speaker 5>But there's a process,</v>

1086
00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:19.050
<v Speaker 5>a series of steps,</v>

1087
00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:19.741
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1088
00:47:19.741 --> 00:47:23.850
<v Speaker 5>The first one might be a mediation or an investigation and then there might be a</v>

1089
00:47:23.851 --> 00:47:24.684
<v Speaker 5>fine.</v>

1090
00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:26.250
<v Speaker 5>And then if you don't pay the fine,</v>

1091
00:47:26.251 --> 00:47:29.530
<v Speaker 5>then your wages might be garnished or you might be ordered to fix it.</v>

1092
00:47:29.890 --> 00:47:30.850
<v Speaker 5>But believe me,</v>

1093
00:47:30.851 --> 00:47:34.000
<v Speaker 5>if you refuse and refuse and refuse and refuse,</v>

1094
00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:36.400
<v Speaker 5>that order will become a court order.</v>

1095
00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:39.220
<v Speaker 5>And then if you don't obey the court order,</v>

1096
00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:40.780
<v Speaker 5>you'll be in contempt of court.</v>

1097
00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:43.720
<v Speaker 5>And then that will lead to arrest and imprisonment.</v>

1098
00:47:43.721 --> 00:47:46.510
<v Speaker 5>So every single rule in the human rights code</v>

1099
00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:53.190
<v Speaker 5>is effectively enforced with the most severe violence the state has,</v>

1100
00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:57.010
<v Speaker 5>even though it's not actually practiced most of the time.</v>

1101
00:47:57.011 --> 00:47:58.840
<v Speaker 5>Because most people obey</v>

1102
00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:00.260
<v Speaker 4>when we,</v>

1103
00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:02.280
<v Speaker 4>we also don't want to underestimate,</v>

1104
00:48:02.830 --> 00:48:06.480
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how many of you have had the pleasure of being dragged before a</v>

1105
00:48:06.481 --> 00:48:08.640
<v Speaker 4>board that investigates your behavior,</v>

1106
00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:12.900
<v Speaker 4>but I would tell you that even if you don't end up paying a fine or in jail,</v>

1107
00:48:12.901 --> 00:48:16.560
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing particularly pleasant about the process itself.</v>

1108
00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:17.431
<v Speaker 4>It's enough.</v>

1109
00:48:17.431 --> 00:48:20.700
<v Speaker 4>You know you wonder why people don't speak up and I can tell you one of the</v>

1110
00:48:20.701 --> 00:48:24.660
<v Speaker 4>reasons they don't speak up is because merely being dragged in front of a board</v>

1111
00:48:24.661 --> 00:48:25.494
<v Speaker 4>of inquiry,</v>

1112
00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:30.630
<v Speaker 4>innocent or guilty is enough to pretty much do you in for a whole year.</v>

1113
00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:35.640
<v Speaker 4>Like if you're a sensible person and you're concerned with propriety and you</v>

1114
00:48:35.641 --> 00:48:39.450
<v Speaker 4>want to maintain the stability of your life and your reputation is important to</v>

1115
00:48:39.451 --> 00:48:40.110
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1116
00:48:40.110 --> 00:48:45.110
<v Speaker 4>perhaps because of the stability of your family depends on it to be investigated</v>

1117
00:48:45.151 --> 00:48:46.710
<v Speaker 4>for such things as a punishment.</v>

1118
00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:47.760
<v Speaker 4>All of its own.</v>

1119
00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:48.630
<v Speaker 4>It's no,</v>

1120
00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:51.750
<v Speaker 4>it's no pleasant business and many of you will you're and stuff.</v>

1121
00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:52.390
<v Speaker 4>I would,</v>

1122
00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:57.130
<v Speaker 4>I would equate being investigated by a non punitive court,</v>

1123
00:48:57.190 --> 00:49:00.670
<v Speaker 4>let's say with these punishments that Bruce described quite far down the</v>

1124
00:49:00.671 --> 00:49:01.031
<v Speaker 4>distance.</v>

1125
00:49:01.031 --> 00:49:03.150
<v Speaker 4>I would equate that to having a,</v>

1126
00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:06.670
<v Speaker 4>a fairly serious disease in terms of its,</v>

1127
00:49:07.090 --> 00:49:09.520
<v Speaker 4>in terms of it's psychological and physical impact.</v>

1128
00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:11.080
<v Speaker 4>I would also say</v>

1129
00:49:12.610 --> 00:49:13.443
<v Speaker 4>no I won't,</v>

1130
00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:14.710
<v Speaker 4>I won't say it.</v>

1131
00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:17.650
<v Speaker 4>Let's go with the next project that's across the place.</v>

1132
00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:18.493
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

1133
00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:19.091
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

1134
00:49:19.091 --> 00:49:19.924
<v Speaker 4>they can vote</v>

1135
00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:25.480
<v Speaker 4>as embarrassing as what's happening out there is easy university.</v>

1136
00:49:25.481 --> 00:49:28.060
<v Speaker 4>I think what it does when I could show how what we're doing here,</v>

1137
00:49:28.061 --> 00:49:28.691
<v Speaker 4>is it how we can,</v>

1138
00:49:28.691 --> 00:49:29.710
<v Speaker 4>those people are so thank you.</v>

1139
00:49:29.711 --> 00:49:30.544
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

1140
00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:35.620
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] of my questions,</v>

1141
00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:41.660
<v Speaker 4>your belief that it's extremely important.</v>

1142
00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:44.910
<v Speaker 4>Everything that we're doing to speak our mind speaking freely.</v>

1143
00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:45.691
<v Speaker 4>That's why we're here.</v>

1144
00:49:45.691 --> 00:49:47.820
<v Speaker 4>But in terms of practicality,</v>

1145
00:49:47.821 --> 00:49:49.110
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of things that get,</v>

1146
00:49:49.130 --> 00:49:50.680
<v Speaker 4>are in the way of her license.</v>

1147
00:49:50.730 --> 00:49:51.071
<v Speaker 4>Students,</v>

1148
00:49:51.071 --> 00:49:51.211
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1149
00:49:51.211 --> 00:49:54.320
<v Speaker 4>we have our prospective soap.</v>

1150
00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:54.720
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1151
00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:56.070
<v Speaker 4>in terms of practicality,</v>

1152
00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:59.760
<v Speaker 4>what are kind of maybe your tips and your perspective on the steps that students</v>

1153
00:49:59.761 --> 00:50:04.761
<v Speaker 4>can take to kind of speak their mind while not sacrificing their future back?</v>

1154
00:50:06.510 --> 00:50:06.890
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1155
00:50:06.890 --> 00:50:10.110
<v Speaker 4>I can tell you a couple of things that are very practical.</v>

1156
00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:14.730
<v Speaker 4>Don't break in your essence what you think the professor wants to hear.</v>

1157
00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:19.650
<v Speaker 4>There's absolutely no excuse whatsoever for doing that.</v>

1158
00:50:20.070 --> 00:50:20.191
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1159
00:50:20.191 --> 00:50:21.150
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

1160
00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:22.380
<v Speaker 4>most professors,</v>

1161
00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:27.060
<v Speaker 4>even those who have descended into a state of ideological possession,</v>

1162
00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:28.280
<v Speaker 4>let's say most</v>

1163
00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:33.280
<v Speaker 7>of them still have enough character to breed an essay that's well written.</v>

1164
00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:37.640
<v Speaker 7>So you're actually taking less of a risk than you would think by stating what</v>

1165
00:50:37.641 --> 00:50:38.750
<v Speaker 7>you have to stay.</v>

1166
00:50:38.810 --> 00:50:39.700
<v Speaker 7>But look,</v>

1167
00:50:39.890 --> 00:50:43.020
<v Speaker 7>if you start practicing when you were in University of mistakes,</v>

1168
00:50:43.050 --> 00:50:46.550
<v Speaker 7>you're rather low pandering to the audience,</v>

1169
00:50:46.551 --> 00:50:50.030
<v Speaker 7>let's say and say what you think will get you buy.</v>

1170
00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:52.430
<v Speaker 7>You're going to train yourself to do that.</v>

1171
00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:55.940
<v Speaker 7>And what that means is you're going to train yourself in the false suffocation</v>

1172
00:50:55.941 --> 00:50:59.690
<v Speaker 7>of your character and your character is the only thing you have to guide you</v>

1173
00:50:59.691 --> 00:51:00.524
<v Speaker 7>through life.</v>

1174
00:51:00.770 --> 00:51:02.120
<v Speaker 7>No people dream of riches.</v>

1175
00:51:02.121 --> 00:51:03.800
<v Speaker 7>And they dream of luxury and all of that.</v>

1176
00:51:03.801 --> 00:51:07.850
<v Speaker 7>But that's a thin defense against the harsh realities of the world.</v>

1177
00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:09.290
<v Speaker 7>You have your character.</v>

1178
00:51:09.590 --> 00:51:13.160
<v Speaker 7>And so what you do when you go to university is you learn to say what you think</v>

1179
00:51:13.161 --> 00:51:16.730
<v Speaker 7>is clearly as you can and to take the slings and arrows that come along with</v>

1180
00:51:16.731 --> 00:51:17.040
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>

1181
00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:17.160
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

1182
00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:17.440
<v Speaker 7>I didn't.</v>

1183
00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:18.310
<v Speaker 7>An hitting manner,</v>

1184
00:51:18.311 --> 00:51:18.531
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1185
00:51:18.531 --> 00:51:20.150
<v Speaker 7>Because like what the hell do you know?</v>

1186
00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:20.961
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

1187
00:51:20.961 --> 00:51:22.220
<v Speaker 7>so you've got plenty to learn,</v>

1188
00:51:22.221 --> 00:51:23.990
<v Speaker 7>but you want to formulate your thoughts carefully.</v>

1189
00:51:24.170 --> 00:51:25.940
<v Speaker 7>You want to write what you think.</v>

1190
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:26.181
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1191
00:51:26.181 --> 00:51:26.840
<v Speaker 7>why?</v>

1192
00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:28.280
<v Speaker 7>Because when you're writing,</v>

1193
00:51:28.370 --> 00:51:29.510
<v Speaker 7>you're thinking,</v>

1194
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:34.700
<v Speaker 7>you're laying out the arguments that you're going to use to structure your</v>

1195
00:51:34.701 --> 00:51:37.190
<v Speaker 7>existence in the world throughout your entire life.</v>

1196
00:51:37.191 --> 00:51:40.700
<v Speaker 7>And if you start to twist and bend those for expedient reasons,</v>

1197
00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:42.680
<v Speaker 7>you're going to warp your soul.</v>

1198
00:51:43.130 --> 00:51:43.491
<v Speaker 7>And I mean,</v>

1199
00:51:43.491 --> 00:51:46.460
<v Speaker 7>I could talk about that neurophysiologically if you want to,</v>

1200
00:51:46.490 --> 00:51:47.000
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1201
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.550
<v Speaker 7>you become what you practice,</v>

1202
00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:51.920
<v Speaker 7>you automate what you practice.</v>

1203
00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:56.780
<v Speaker 7>So if you automate expedient speech for the sake of short term gain,</v>

1204
00:51:56.930 --> 00:51:58.400
<v Speaker 7>then that's what you're going to produce.</v>

1205
00:51:58.401 --> 00:52:00.980
<v Speaker 7>You're going to produce expedient speech for short term gain.</v>

1206
00:52:00.981 --> 00:52:02.870
<v Speaker 7>Well God help you if you do that,</v>

1207
00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:08.230
<v Speaker 7>like there is nothing that you will possibly do in your entire life that will</v>

1208
00:52:09.171 --> 00:52:13.790
<v Speaker 7>serve you better than to get control of your voice in university.</v>

1209
00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:16.160
<v Speaker 7>I remember seeing you do that by reading,</v>

1210
00:52:16.190 --> 00:52:16.790
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1211
00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:18.260
<v Speaker 7>You read great people.</v>

1212
00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:20.780
<v Speaker 7>You do that by writing what you think.</v>

1213
00:52:20.781 --> 00:52:24.200
<v Speaker 7>You stay true to yourself while you write what you think and you take the risks</v>

1214
00:52:24.201 --> 00:52:26.180
<v Speaker 7>and you gain the benefits that go along with that.</v>

1215
00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:31.070
<v Speaker 7>You learn to stand up and speak and to listen carefully and that makes you a</v>

1216
00:52:31.071 --> 00:52:33.620
<v Speaker 7>negotiator of unparalleled power.</v>

1217
00:52:33.830 --> 00:52:36.050
<v Speaker 7>And if you're a negotiator of unparalleled power,</v>

1218
00:52:36.051 --> 00:52:39.170
<v Speaker 7>there's nothing in the world that won't open itself up to you.</v>

1219
00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:41.750
<v Speaker 7>So that's what you're doing in university.</v>

1220
00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:43.550
<v Speaker 7>And if you find professors who,</v>

1221
00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:48.050
<v Speaker 7>who reject that and there's fewer of them than you might think,</v>

1222
00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:53.470
<v Speaker 7>then it's your sacred obligation to stand up for yourself against that because</v>

1223
00:52:54.861 --> 00:52:56.690
<v Speaker 7>it's going to happen to you throughout your whole life.</v>

1224
00:52:56.691 --> 00:52:59.930
<v Speaker 7>And you might as well start practicing how to do it right now.</v>

1225
00:53:00.650 --> 00:53:02.630
<v Speaker 7>So that's how it looks to me.</v>

1226
00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:02.811
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1227
00:53:02.811 --> 00:53:04.860
<v Speaker 7>There's an old saying that I write</v>

1228
00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:12.060
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

1229
00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:16.640
<v Speaker 7>I write in order to know what I think.</v>

1230
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:21.920
<v Speaker 7>And you'll note how compelled speech interferes in that process.</v>

1231
00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:22.600
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>

1232
00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:27.150
<v Speaker 7>So the idea that you have to write what professor wants is a form of compelled</v>

1233
00:53:27.151 --> 00:53:27.541
<v Speaker 7>speech.</v>

1234
00:53:27.541 --> 00:53:28.580
<v Speaker 7>It's like it.</v>

1235
00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:31.050
<v Speaker 7>I really do believe that this is a fundamental issue.</v>

1236
00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:32.490
<v Speaker 7>As a therapist,</v>

1237
00:53:32.491 --> 00:53:36.270
<v Speaker 7>say when I'm trying to help someone set their life straight,</v>

1238
00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:38.940
<v Speaker 7>I do my best not to compel their speech.</v>

1239
00:53:38.941 --> 00:53:40.470
<v Speaker 7>And the reason for that is quite clear.</v>

1240
00:53:40.471 --> 00:53:45.471
<v Speaker 7>It's like you have your destiny with all its attended triumphs and sufferings</v>

1241
00:53:46.530 --> 00:53:48.330
<v Speaker 7>and it's on your shoulders.</v>

1242
00:53:48.570 --> 00:53:50.460
<v Speaker 7>I don't want to tell you how to think.</v>

1243
00:53:50.850 --> 00:53:54.090
<v Speaker 7>I don't want to tell you how to think because I do not know how you should</v>

1244
00:53:54.091 --> 00:53:54.810
<v Speaker 7>think.</v>

1245
00:53:54.810 --> 00:53:57.170
<v Speaker 7>You have to figure that out for yourself and,</v>

1246
00:53:57.180 --> 00:53:59.790
<v Speaker 7>and then you have to bear the responsibility for that.</v>

1247
00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:01.150
<v Speaker 7>And you,</v>

1248
00:54:01.170 --> 00:54:03.390
<v Speaker 7>you were a terribly arrogant fool.</v>

1249
00:54:03.390 --> 00:54:08.340
<v Speaker 7>If you dare to tell someone else how it is that they should conduct themselves</v>

1250
00:54:08.341 --> 00:54:09.174
<v Speaker 7>through life.</v>

1251
00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:09.481
<v Speaker 7>Now.</v>

1252
00:54:09.481 --> 00:54:10.314
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1253
00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:11.340
<v Speaker 7>having said that,</v>

1254
00:54:11.341 --> 00:54:12.510
<v Speaker 7>while obviously I say,</v>

1255
00:54:12.511 --> 00:54:12.721
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1256
00:54:12.721 --> 00:54:14.910
<v Speaker 7>you should tell the truth or at least you shouldn't lie,</v>

1257
00:54:14.911 --> 00:54:17.220
<v Speaker 7>but that's not a dictate of,</v>

1258
00:54:17.370 --> 00:54:18.120
<v Speaker 7>of,</v>

1259
00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:18.953
<v Speaker 7>of,</v>

1260
00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:19.590
<v Speaker 7>of,</v>

1261
00:54:19.590 --> 00:54:20.880
<v Speaker 7>of actions so to speak.</v>

1262
00:54:20.881 --> 00:54:22.530
<v Speaker 7>It's a dictate of process.</v>

1263
00:54:22.890 --> 00:54:23.191
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

1264
00:54:23.191 --> 00:54:23.371
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1265
00:54:23.371 --> 00:54:23.791
<v Speaker 7>you can't,</v>

1266
00:54:23.791 --> 00:54:27.270
<v Speaker 7>you shouldn't interfere with the mechanism that allows you to solve all the</v>

1267
00:54:27.271 --> 00:54:31.830
<v Speaker 7>problems that you will face in your life and you come to university maybe to</v>

1268
00:54:31.831 --> 00:54:32.450
<v Speaker 7>prepare for,</v>

1269
00:54:32.450 --> 00:54:32.780
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1270
00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:33.210
<v Speaker 7>for a,</v>

1271
00:54:33.210 --> 00:54:34.110
<v Speaker 7>for a profession,</v>

1272
00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:34.680
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

1273
00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:36.510
<v Speaker 7>and to set yourself up economically,</v>

1274
00:54:36.511 --> 00:54:39.390
<v Speaker 7>but to set yourself economic economically,</v>

1275
00:54:39.391 --> 00:54:40.110
<v Speaker 7>properly.</v>

1276
00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:42.150
<v Speaker 7>I don't care what your profession is going to be.</v>

1277
00:54:42.510 --> 00:54:46.260
<v Speaker 7>There is no one who is more powerful than someone who can communicate.</v>

1278
00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:48.090
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't matter what the field,</v>

1279
00:54:48.091 --> 00:54:50.580
<v Speaker 7>it doesn't matter if you're a plumber or a politician.</v>

1280
00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:53.130
<v Speaker 7>If you can formulate your thoughts clearly.</v>

1281
00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:57.570
<v Speaker 7>If you can conduct yourself honorably in your action and your speech,</v>

1282
00:54:57.630 --> 00:54:59.880
<v Speaker 7>if you're articulate and careful,</v>

1283
00:54:59.881 --> 00:55:02.760
<v Speaker 7>then the world opens itself up to you.</v>

1284
00:55:02.770 --> 00:55:05.190
<v Speaker 7>You have an unlimited horizon of possibility.</v>

1285
00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:06.930
<v Speaker 7>So thank you very much.</v>

1286
00:55:07.260 --> 00:55:08.093
<v Speaker 7>Yup.</v>

1287
00:55:08.310 --> 00:55:13.310
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

1288
00:55:16.540 --> 00:55:16.691
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1289
00:55:16.691 --> 00:55:17.860
<v Speaker 4>thank you both for coming with,</v>

1290
00:55:17.861 --> 00:55:18.281
<v Speaker 4>firstly,</v>

1291
00:55:18.281 --> 00:55:22.390
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to thank everyone in the room who is not devolved into the hysteria we</v>

1292
00:55:22.391 --> 00:55:23.320
<v Speaker 4>see outside.</v>

1293
00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:28.510
<v Speaker 4>They would prefer that we lost our sanity and that our society would fracture</v>

1294
00:55:28.511 --> 00:55:29.950
<v Speaker 4>into the nonsense we see.</v>

1295
00:55:29.951 --> 00:55:31.330
<v Speaker 4>So by sitting here,</v>

1296
00:55:31.331 --> 00:55:32.740
<v Speaker 4>being as patient as you are,</v>

1297
00:55:33.070 --> 00:55:34.930
<v Speaker 4>this is how we keep our academy.</v>

1298
00:55:35.170 --> 00:55:36.730
<v Speaker 4>This is how we keep our society.</v>

1299
00:55:36.731 --> 00:55:37.564
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

1300
00:55:37.570 --> 00:55:42.570
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

1301
00:55:46.810 --> 00:55:48.580
<v Speaker 4>my question is a simple one.</v>

1302
00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:48.970
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1303
00:55:48.970 --> 00:55:52.240
<v Speaker 4>we see more and more of this new language I call of leftism,</v>

1304
00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:53.410
<v Speaker 4>intersectionality,</v>

1305
00:55:53.411 --> 00:55:53.861
<v Speaker 4>equity,</v>

1306
00:55:53.861 --> 00:55:54.611
<v Speaker 4>diversity,</v>

1307
00:55:54.611 --> 00:55:55.444
<v Speaker 4>inclusion,</v>

1308
00:55:55.510 --> 00:56:00.430
<v Speaker 4>and we see people from all political and philosophical straights adopting this</v>

1309
00:56:00.431 --> 00:56:01.360
<v Speaker 4>new vernacular.</v>

1310
00:56:02.050 --> 00:56:05.110
<v Speaker 4>Is this in any way dignifying that as a position,</v>

1311
00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:09.640
<v Speaker 4>is this dignifying the philosophical bases of these words?</v>

1312
00:56:09.641 --> 00:56:11.880
<v Speaker 4>Do people recognize that when they use these,</v>

1313
00:56:11.930 --> 00:56:12.230
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1314
00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:16.810
<v Speaker 4>these words that they making that somehow a truth that we all ought to,</v>

1315
00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:18.250
<v Speaker 4>except I don't,</v>

1316
00:56:18.251 --> 00:56:19.120
<v Speaker 4>should we or should we not?</v>

1317
00:56:19.150 --> 00:56:19.983
<v Speaker 4>I don't think people,</v>

1318
00:56:20.020 --> 00:56:21.120
<v Speaker 7>you recognize that.</v>

1319
00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:22.100
<v Speaker 7>Again,</v>

1320
00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:26.290
<v Speaker 7>you know what I'd like reiterate with the reason I made those videos to begin</v>

1321
00:56:26.291 --> 00:56:27.340
<v Speaker 7>with was because I don't,</v>

1322
00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:32.250
<v Speaker 7>I was unwilling to see the linguistic territory as soon as you think it's</v>

1323
00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:33.670
<v Speaker 7>already happening to some degree.</v>

1324
00:56:33.671 --> 00:56:38.230
<v Speaker 7>So imagine that we just did define the sociopolitical landscape in terms of</v>

1325
00:56:38.231 --> 00:56:39.280
<v Speaker 7>identity politics,</v>

1326
00:56:39.310 --> 00:56:40.540
<v Speaker 7>which is happening very rapidly.</v>

1327
00:56:40.541 --> 00:56:40.931
<v Speaker 7>In fact,</v>

1328
00:56:40.931 --> 00:56:42.160
<v Speaker 7>we're compelled to do so.</v>

1329
00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:43.023
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

1330
00:56:43.030 --> 00:56:43.863
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

1331
00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:45.033
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

1332
00:56:45.070 --> 00:56:45.521
<v Speaker 7>well then,</v>

1333
00:56:45.521 --> 00:56:50.020
<v Speaker 7>then what happens is you get activity on the identity politics front on the left</v>

1334
00:56:50.170 --> 00:56:52.720
<v Speaker 7>and on the right the left says,</v>

1335
00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:53.590
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1336
00:56:53.590 --> 00:56:56.440
<v Speaker 7>the oppressed shall rise and take their rightful place.</v>

1337
00:56:56.620 --> 00:56:57.580
<v Speaker 7>And the right says,</v>

1338
00:56:57.800 --> 00:56:58.000
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

1339
00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.610
<v Speaker 7>over my dead body and probably yours too.</v>

1340
00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:04.450
<v Speaker 7>So as soon as we played the identity politics game,</v>

1341
00:57:04.660 --> 00:57:06.100
<v Speaker 7>that's where we're at.</v>

1342
00:57:06.370 --> 00:57:08.890
<v Speaker 7>And we start playing it by accepting the terminology.</v>

1343
00:57:09.460 --> 00:57:09.671
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

1344
00:57:09.671 --> 00:57:13.930
<v Speaker 7>already I find myself stumbling when I used the word sex instead of gender.</v>

1345
00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:15.461
<v Speaker 7>And that's not good.</v>

1346
00:57:15.461 --> 00:57:20.461
<v Speaker 7>Like I have to consciously overcome a resistance to use the word sex instead of</v>

1347
00:57:20.561 --> 00:57:21.760
<v Speaker 7>gender because you know,</v>

1348
00:57:21.761 --> 00:57:26.320
<v Speaker 7>I'm actually quite an agreeable person and it actually pains me to,</v>

1349
00:57:27.010 --> 00:57:28.420
<v Speaker 7>to go against the crowd.</v>

1350
00:57:28.421 --> 00:57:29.110
<v Speaker 7>Let's say,</v>

1351
00:57:29.110 --> 00:57:29.381
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1352
00:57:29.381 --> 00:57:31.660
<v Speaker 7>I'm not temperamentally suited for it precisely,</v>

1353
00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:32.860
<v Speaker 7>strangely enough.</v>

1354
00:57:33.130 --> 00:57:37.960
<v Speaker 7>And so I feel the compulsion to use this kind of language welling up inside of</v>

1355
00:57:37.961 --> 00:57:39.220
<v Speaker 7>me just to be,</v>

1356
00:57:40.450 --> 00:57:41.261
<v Speaker 7>to be nice,</v>

1357
00:57:41.261 --> 00:57:42.190
<v Speaker 7>I suppose,</v>

1358
00:57:42.220 --> 00:57:43.000
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1359
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:46.420
<v Speaker 7>but I know where identity politics leads.</v>

1360
00:57:46.990 --> 00:57:48.490
<v Speaker 7>It leads to the Ghoulag,</v>

1361
00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:50.740
<v Speaker 7>it leads to the concentration camps.</v>

1362
00:57:50.741 --> 00:57:52.420
<v Speaker 7>It leads to blood in the streets.</v>

1363
00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:54.310
<v Speaker 7>We don't need that here.</v>

1364
00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:55.900
<v Speaker 7>We're doing pretty well.</v>

1365
00:57:56.170 --> 00:57:57.760
<v Speaker 7>So we could leave it.</v>

1366
00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:07.981
<v Speaker 8>Hi,</v>

1367
00:58:07.981 --> 00:58:08.814
<v Speaker 8>Professor Peterson.</v>

1368
00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:09.150
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

1369
00:58:09.150 --> 00:58:13.180
<v Speaker 8>I studied history for the duration of my degree and I think it's just a</v>

1370
00:58:13.230 --> 00:58:17.760
<v Speaker 8>sickeningly ironic that the people who are using their free speech,</v>

1371
00:58:17.761 --> 00:58:22.440
<v Speaker 8>one to take away your free speech and furthermore that they can't see the irony</v>

1372
00:58:22.441 --> 00:58:25.260
<v Speaker 8>of this situation of how tyrannical there being a,</v>

1373
00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:26.011
<v Speaker 8>my question is,</v>

1374
00:58:26.011 --> 00:58:26.470
<v Speaker 8>however,</v>

1375
00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:27.210
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

1376
00:58:27.210 --> 00:58:30.240
<v Speaker 8>I've noticed from a lot of what you've talked about and I've been watching you</v>

1377
00:58:30.241 --> 00:58:31.700
<v Speaker 8>since your rise in 2060,</v>

1378
00:58:32.010 --> 00:58:32.843
<v Speaker 8>2016,</v>

1379
00:58:33.030 --> 00:58:33.863
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

1380
00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:36.330
<v Speaker 8>and I know that you're a Christian and I don't want to divulge into that,</v>

1381
00:58:36.331 --> 00:58:41.310
<v Speaker 8>but I noticed a lot of the sort of North American Protestant work ethic in,</v>

1382
00:58:41.490 --> 00:58:41.880
<v Speaker 8>in,</v>

1383
00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:42.240
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

1384
00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:43.050
<v Speaker 8>in your lessons.</v>

1385
00:58:43.050 --> 00:58:43.261
<v Speaker 8>Like,</v>

1386
00:58:43.261 --> 00:58:43.740
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1387
00:58:43.740 --> 00:58:43.980
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

1388
00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:45.930
<v Speaker 8>self redemption and to be your own person.</v>

1389
00:58:45.931 --> 00:58:48.600
<v Speaker 8>Like we've been talking about that last like hour and a half I suppose.</v>

1390
00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:50.220
<v Speaker 8>And um,</v>

1391
00:58:50.670 --> 00:58:53.490
<v Speaker 8>in a ever rising tide where people are,</v>

1392
00:58:53.580 --> 00:58:57.390
<v Speaker 8>or rather in the western world where it's becoming increasingly rather</v>

1393
00:58:57.391 --> 00:58:59.220
<v Speaker 8>decreasingly Christian and specifically,</v>

1394
00:58:59.810 --> 00:59:00.160
<v Speaker 8>yeah.</v>

1395
00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:03.240
<v Speaker 8>Decreasingly religious nuns specifically decreasingly Christian.</v>

1396
00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:04.373
<v Speaker 8>How can you,</v>

1397
00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:08.700
<v Speaker 8>what do you think is the best suggestion in order to be able to uphold those</v>

1398
00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:11.780
<v Speaker 8>such important values that have been across the world,</v>

1399
00:59:11.860 --> 00:59:12.180
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

1400
00:59:12.180 --> 00:59:14.700
<v Speaker 8>from American cultural influence since the end of the Second World War?</v>

1401
00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:15.960
<v Speaker 8>I apologize for the long question.</v>

1402
00:59:16.110 --> 00:59:16.180
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

1403
00:59:16.180 --> 00:59:16.800
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

1404
00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:17.633
<v Speaker 7>it's fine.</v>

1405
00:59:18.610 --> 00:59:19.443
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

1406
00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:24.620
<v Speaker 7>people have asked me repeatedly my religious views and I've answered them in a</v>

1407
00:59:25.431 --> 00:59:26.420
<v Speaker 7>variety of different ways,</v>

1408
00:59:26.421 --> 00:59:28.190
<v Speaker 7>but they say,</v>

1409
00:59:28.191 --> 00:59:29.240
<v Speaker 7>do you believe in God?</v>

1410
00:59:29.241 --> 00:59:32.180
<v Speaker 7>Let's say my response to that always is,</v>

1411
00:59:32.181 --> 00:59:32.361
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1412
00:59:32.361 --> 00:59:35.180
<v Speaker 7>I don't know what you mean when you ask me that question.</v>

1413
00:59:35.181 --> 00:59:36.470
<v Speaker 7>So I don't know how to answer it.</v>

1414
00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:38.210
<v Speaker 7>I don't know what you mean by belief,</v>

1415
00:59:38.420 --> 00:59:42.800
<v Speaker 7>but I can tell you something that I believe and I would say this is a way of</v>

1416
00:59:42.801 --> 00:59:44.120
<v Speaker 7>speaking symbolically.</v>

1417
00:59:44.900 --> 00:59:46.340
<v Speaker 7>I do believe so.</v>

1418
00:59:46.341 --> 00:59:49.820
<v Speaker 7>I was thinking the other day and week ago I was thinking about this I this</v>

1419
00:59:49.821 --> 00:59:51.530
<v Speaker 7>little fantasy that entered my mind.</v>

1420
00:59:52.190 --> 00:59:56.600
<v Speaker 7>I was thinking about Saint Joseph's oratorial in Montreal and Saint Joseph's</v>

1421
00:59:56.601 --> 00:59:57.021
<v Speaker 7>oratory.</v>

1422
00:59:57.021 --> 00:59:58.580
<v Speaker 7>It was a very large religious building.</v>

1423
00:59:58.581 --> 01:00:01.400
<v Speaker 7>It's one of the biggest cathedral light structures in the world,</v>

1424
01:00:01.401 --> 01:00:04.910
<v Speaker 7>and it's set on the hill and mount royal and it's set up where it can catch the</v>

1425
01:00:04.911 --> 01:00:05.744
<v Speaker 7>sun,</v>

1426
01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:05.960
<v Speaker 7>you know?</v>

1427
01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:08.510
<v Speaker 7>So it's an image of the heavenly city on the hill,</v>

1428
01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:09.050
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1429
01:00:09.050 --> 01:00:12.830
<v Speaker 7>It's an image of the structures that we strive to create.</v>

1430
01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:16.910
<v Speaker 7>That's what it is in independent of its specifically Christian or religious</v>

1431
01:00:16.911 --> 01:00:17.600
<v Speaker 7>function.</v>

1432
01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:19.280
<v Speaker 7>That's what it stands for symbolically.</v>

1433
01:00:19.281 --> 01:00:19.551
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>

1434
01:00:19.551 --> 01:00:20.660
<v Speaker 7>so it's the city on the hill.</v>

1435
01:00:20.661 --> 01:00:21.050
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>

1436
01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:25.250
<v Speaker 7>it's what we're striving towards when we walk up hill in life.</v>

1437
01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:25.911
<v Speaker 7>Okay?</v>

1438
01:00:25.911 --> 01:00:27.010
<v Speaker 7>Now the way the,</v>

1439
01:00:27.011 --> 01:00:27.340
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

1440
01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:27.951
<v Speaker 7>the oratory,</v>

1441
01:00:27.951 --> 01:00:28.641
<v Speaker 7>it was structured,</v>

1442
01:00:28.641 --> 01:00:31.220
<v Speaker 7>there's hundreds of steps leading to it up front.</v>

1443
01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:33.350
<v Speaker 7>And in the early part of the 20th century,</v>

1444
01:00:33.351 --> 01:00:36.830
<v Speaker 7>a lot of people who had physical disabilities came there and they struggled up</v>

1445
01:00:36.831 --> 01:00:39.980
<v Speaker 7>the step on their crutches and many of them left their crutches in the</v>

1446
01:00:39.981 --> 01:00:40.611
<v Speaker 7>oratorial.</v>

1447
01:00:40.611 --> 01:00:42.410
<v Speaker 7>You can see hundreds of them if you go there.</v>

1448
01:00:42.411 --> 01:00:43.760
<v Speaker 7>It's quite an interesting site.</v>

1449
01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:47.870
<v Speaker 7>And I was thinking about that and I was thinking about what that meant and this</v>

1450
01:00:47.871 --> 01:00:48.830
<v Speaker 7>is what it means.</v>

1451
01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:51.050
<v Speaker 7>It means that you know,</v>

1452
01:00:51.110 --> 01:00:53.090
<v Speaker 7>everyone has their disabilities,</v>

1453
01:00:53.091 --> 01:00:53.511
<v Speaker 7>let's say,</v>

1454
01:00:53.511 --> 01:00:57.680
<v Speaker 7>and I know that some people are far more terribly effected than other people.</v>

1455
01:00:57.681 --> 01:00:58.880
<v Speaker 7>I'm perfectly aware of that.</v>

1456
01:00:59.330 --> 01:01:01.340
<v Speaker 7>But the question is what do you do about that?</v>

1457
01:01:01.341 --> 01:01:06.341
<v Speaker 7>And what you do is you set yourself up on your damn crutches and you struggle up</v>

1458
01:01:06.531 --> 01:01:07.700
<v Speaker 7>the bloody hill.</v>

1459
01:01:07.790 --> 01:01:08.780
<v Speaker 7>That's what you do.</v>

1460
01:01:08.930 --> 01:01:11.840
<v Speaker 7>And you struggle up the hill towards the Kingdom of God.</v>

1461
01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:16.220
<v Speaker 7>That's what you do because the alternative is to descend into the abyss.</v>

1462
01:01:16.550 --> 01:01:17.840
<v Speaker 7>That's the alternative.</v>

1463
01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:19.190
<v Speaker 7>And then so to say,</v>

1464
01:01:19.191 --> 01:01:19.401
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1465
01:01:19.401 --> 01:01:23.210
<v Speaker 7>do you believe it's like I believe that you should struggle uphill towards the</v>

1466
01:01:23.211 --> 01:01:25.130
<v Speaker 7>city of God on your crutches.</v>

1467
01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:27.410
<v Speaker 7>That's what you should do.</v>

1468
01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:30.590
<v Speaker 7>That's the opposite of the descent into the abyss.</v>

1469
01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:32.600
<v Speaker 7>And so that's,</v>

1470
01:01:32.810 --> 01:01:35.540
<v Speaker 7>that's at the foundation of our civilization.</v>

1471
01:01:35.541 --> 01:01:36.374
<v Speaker 7>That idea.</v>

1472
01:01:36.590 --> 01:01:37.423
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1473
01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:38.241
<v Speaker 7>argue with it.</v>

1474
01:01:38.241 --> 01:01:39.074
<v Speaker 7>If you will,</v>

1475
01:01:39.170 --> 01:01:42.020
<v Speaker 7>see if you can figure out why that's not an acceptable idea.</v>

1476
01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:44.270
<v Speaker 7>Maybe you should help someone's struggle up the hill.</v>

1477
01:01:44.271 --> 01:01:45.290
<v Speaker 7>Perhaps you should,</v>

1478
01:01:45.650 --> 01:01:45.891
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1479
01:01:45.891 --> 01:01:49.340
<v Speaker 7>you can lend a hand to someone or you don't want to take the burden away from</v>

1480
01:01:49.341 --> 01:01:53.630
<v Speaker 7>them entirely because there's something noble about struggling up the Damn Hill,</v>

1481
01:01:53.631 --> 01:01:53.901
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1482
01:01:53.901 --> 01:01:55.430
<v Speaker 7>There's something that's adventure.</v>

1483
01:01:55.431 --> 01:01:57.830
<v Speaker 7>That's the call to proper being.</v>

1484
01:01:58.270 --> 01:01:58.581
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

1485
01:01:58.581 --> 01:01:59.120
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1486
01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:00.950
<v Speaker 7>we don't need to forget this.</v>

1487
01:02:01.790 --> 01:02:02.000
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

1488
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.230
<v Speaker 7>we don't need to forget it.</v>

1489
01:02:03.410 --> 01:02:08.410
<v Speaker 7>The universities have been there since time in memorial to try to push that idea</v>

1490
01:02:08.541 --> 01:02:10.070
<v Speaker 7>forward through the generations,</v>

1491
01:02:10.190 --> 01:02:11.930
<v Speaker 7>and everyone needs to know that idea.</v>

1492
01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:13.130
<v Speaker 7>That's what gives you life,</v>

1493
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:14.630
<v Speaker 7>not happiness.</v>

1494
01:02:14.660 --> 01:02:15.860
<v Speaker 7>Forget about that.</v>

1495
01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:17.091
<v Speaker 7>If it comes,</v>

1496
01:02:17.091 --> 01:02:17.391
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1497
01:02:17.391 --> 01:02:17.960
<v Speaker 7>great.</v>

1498
01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:19.820
<v Speaker 7>Except it dignity,</v>

1499
01:02:19.870 --> 01:02:20.790
<v Speaker 7>nobility,</v>

1500
01:02:21.390 --> 01:02:22.200
<v Speaker 7>character,</v>

1501
01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:22.771
<v Speaker 7>truth,</v>

1502
01:02:22.771 --> 01:02:23.910
<v Speaker 7>responsibility,</v>

1503
01:02:23.911 --> 01:02:24.744
<v Speaker 7>beauty.</v>

1504
01:02:25.050 --> 01:02:27.010
<v Speaker 7>Those are the things to aim for honor too.</v>

1505
01:02:27.011 --> 01:02:28.350
<v Speaker 7>I'd say honor.</v>

1506
01:02:29.090 --> 01:02:32.010
<v Speaker 7>Thank you very much and I hope when all this is done,</v>

1507
01:02:32.011 --> 01:02:32.970
<v Speaker 7>I hope you take a nice long,</v>

1508
01:02:32.971 --> 01:02:34.500
<v Speaker 7>big vacation cause I think you really deserve it.</v>

1509
01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:40.413
<v Speaker 1>Hello.</v>

1510
01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:42.230
<v Speaker 9>Okay,</v>

1511
01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:43.340
<v Speaker 9>Peterson first.</v>

1512
01:02:43.341 --> 01:02:44.174
<v Speaker 9>Thank you for coming.</v>

1513
01:02:44.690 --> 01:02:46.400
<v Speaker 9>And I'm so,</v>

1514
01:02:46.490 --> 01:02:47.380
<v Speaker 9>I'm Chinese.</v>

1515
01:02:47.810 --> 01:02:51.680
<v Speaker 9>My parents grew up in the cultural revolution of China,</v>

1516
01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:56.900
<v Speaker 9>so I took particular attention when you mentioned the multiple occasions</v>

1517
01:02:57.020 --> 01:02:59.960
<v Speaker 9>comparing what's happening in the West right now,</v>

1518
01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:00.651
<v Speaker 9>two miles,</v>

1519
01:03:00.651 --> 01:03:02.090
<v Speaker 9>China and I,</v>

1520
01:03:02.330 --> 01:03:05.780
<v Speaker 9>I agree and it's pretty obvious the connection between their radiology,</v>

1521
01:03:05.781 --> 01:03:10.400
<v Speaker 9>the identity politics and the oppression versus oppressed viewpoints.</v>

1522
01:03:10.670 --> 01:03:15.670
<v Speaker 9>But my question is mostly about how they're promoting the political agenda.</v>

1523
01:03:16.010 --> 01:03:16.251
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>

1524
01:03:16.251 --> 01:03:18.380
<v Speaker 9>I see that the political agenda,</v>

1525
01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:21.200
<v Speaker 9>the philosophy behind the political agenda are very similar,</v>

1526
01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:23.000
<v Speaker 9>but at the same time,</v>

1527
01:03:23.001 --> 01:03:27.050
<v Speaker 9>I see a shocking similarity in the way that they promoting that political</v>

1528
01:03:27.051 --> 01:03:27.680
<v Speaker 9>agenda.</v>

1529
01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:31.310
<v Speaker 9>Specifically backing back in the culture revolution.</v>

1530
01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:36.460
<v Speaker 9>Anyone who dare to say anything that it's not fully for the movement was</v>

1531
01:03:36.651 --> 01:03:38.840
<v Speaker 9>classified as Nq revolutionary.</v>

1532
01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:43.880
<v Speaker 9>Just as now who anyone who dare to say anything that goes remotely,</v>

1533
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:49.000
<v Speaker 9>not fully aligned with whatever they want to promote is classified as hate</v>

1534
01:03:49.791 --> 01:03:50.624
<v Speaker 9>speech.</v>

1535
01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:53.480
<v Speaker 9>Although it has nothing to do with hate hating anybody.</v>

1536
01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:58.010
<v Speaker 9>So since the same thing is happening here and a Mao's China,</v>

1537
01:03:58.610 --> 01:03:59.750
<v Speaker 9>what would you say?</v>

1538
01:03:59.751 --> 01:03:59.871
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>

1539
01:03:59.871 --> 01:03:59.991
<v Speaker 9>what,</v>

1540
01:03:59.991 --> 01:04:04.991
<v Speaker 9>what do you think is the connection between the philosophy and they're idiotic</v>

1541
01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:08.390
<v Speaker 9>oversimplifying and tyrannical way of him,</v>

1542
01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:09.830
<v Speaker 9>of trying to promoting it?</v>

1543
01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:11.920
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1544
01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:12.753
<v Speaker 7>the first thing,</v>

1545
01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:17.770
<v Speaker 7>the first thing we should make clear is that there is such a thing as hate</v>

1546
01:04:17.771 --> 01:04:18.604
<v Speaker 7>speech,</v>

1547
01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:19.810
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1548
01:04:19.810 --> 01:04:24.790
<v Speaker 7>Like let's not be naive about this and you can use words to inflame and words</v>

1549
01:04:24.791 --> 01:04:26.560
<v Speaker 7>can be very dangerous tools.</v>

1550
01:04:27.010 --> 01:04:29.320
<v Speaker 7>People use them and hateful matters all the time.</v>

1551
01:04:29.830 --> 01:04:30.850
<v Speaker 7>That's not the issue.</v>

1552
01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:32.110
<v Speaker 7>That's obvious.</v>

1553
01:04:32.770 --> 01:04:37.420
<v Speaker 7>The issue is whether or not you should regulate out and even more importantly,</v>

1554
01:04:37.421 --> 01:04:38.860
<v Speaker 7>whether the state should regulate it.</v>

1555
01:04:38.861 --> 01:04:42.340
<v Speaker 7>And the reason that's an issue is because who's going to define it?</v>

1556
01:04:42.820 --> 01:04:44.890
<v Speaker 7>I'll tell you who's going to define hate speech.</v>

1557
01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:48.100
<v Speaker 7>It's the people who are doing that that are going to define hate speech.</v>

1558
01:04:48.310 --> 01:04:51.940
<v Speaker 7>And right now they're defining you sitting in here as hate speech.</v>

1559
01:04:52.330 --> 01:04:52.541
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1560
01:04:52.541 --> 01:04:54.760
<v Speaker 7>that's exactly what's going on while we sit here.</v>

1561
01:04:54.761 --> 01:04:59.350
<v Speaker 7>It's like who would be interested in defining the parameters of hate speech?</v>

1562
01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:00.460
<v Speaker 7>Here's the answer.</v>

1563
01:05:00.790 --> 01:05:05.790
<v Speaker 7>The people that you would least want to have adopt that responsibility and and</v>

1564
01:05:06.281 --> 01:05:06.971
<v Speaker 7>hate speech.</v>

1565
01:05:06.971 --> 01:05:07.700
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

1566
01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:12.160
<v Speaker 7>let's say I was interviewed a while back and the journalist asked me,</v>

1567
01:05:12.580 --> 01:05:12.731
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1568
01:05:12.731 --> 01:05:14.630
<v Speaker 7>why should your right to a family Trump,</v>

1569
01:05:14.631 --> 01:05:16.390
<v Speaker 7>someone's right to be secure?</v>

1570
01:05:16.420 --> 01:05:17.253
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

1571
01:05:17.290 --> 01:05:18.123
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>

1572
01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:22.330
<v Speaker 7>well let's say I'm talking to one person and you might say,</v>

1573
01:05:22.331 --> 01:05:23.890
<v Speaker 7>well I don't have the right to offend them.</v>

1574
01:05:23.970 --> 01:05:24.251
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

1575
01:05:24.251 --> 01:05:25.084
<v Speaker 7>all right,</v>

1576
01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:26.770
<v Speaker 7>what if I'm talking to 10 people?</v>

1577
01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:30.720
<v Speaker 7>Do I have the right to offend one of those people when I speak to the mortar,</v>

1578
01:05:30.721 --> 01:05:31.870
<v Speaker 7>if it's a thousand people,</v>

1579
01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:33.540
<v Speaker 7>what you're saying</v>

1580
01:05:38.450 --> 01:05:43.450
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

1581
01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:46.553
<v Speaker 7>you can't,</v>

1582
01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:51.120
<v Speaker 7>you can't have a conversation about something serious without offense.</v>

1583
01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:53.760
<v Speaker 7>Like if I'm thinking about something serious,</v>

1584
01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.680
<v Speaker 7>like I often myself,</v>

1585
01:05:56.190 --> 01:05:56.401
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1586
01:05:56.401 --> 01:05:57.810
<v Speaker 7>and I seriously mean that.</v>

1587
01:05:57.811 --> 01:05:58.650
<v Speaker 7>I really mean that.</v>

1588
01:05:58.651 --> 01:06:01.530
<v Speaker 7>So like if I'm laying out a set of hypotheses,</v>

1589
01:06:01.531 --> 01:06:02.161
<v Speaker 7>for example,</v>

1590
01:06:02.161 --> 01:06:03.630
<v Speaker 7>about a complex social,</v>

1591
01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:04.920
<v Speaker 7>a social problem,</v>

1592
01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:08.010
<v Speaker 7>I might lay out 20 hypothesis and maybe two of them.</v>

1593
01:06:08.011 --> 01:06:08.910
<v Speaker 7>I thank God,</v>

1594
01:06:08.911 --> 01:06:10.140
<v Speaker 7>I hope that's not true.</v>

1595
01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:11.880
<v Speaker 7>But like maybe it is true.</v>

1596
01:06:11.881 --> 01:06:12.510
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

1597
01:06:12.510 --> 01:06:16.260
<v Speaker 7>sometimes you discover things as a social scientist that you wish were true and</v>

1598
01:06:16.350 --> 01:06:19.380
<v Speaker 7>those are usually the things that you've discovered that are actually true,</v>

1599
01:06:19.381 --> 01:06:19.651
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1600
01:06:19.651 --> 01:06:21.180
<v Speaker 7>Cause they violate your assumptions.</v>

1601
01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:26.510
<v Speaker 7>So you can't even think if you're not willing to offend yourself.</v>

1602
01:06:27.090 --> 01:06:28.380
<v Speaker 7>That's what thinking does.</v>

1603
01:06:28.381 --> 01:06:32.130
<v Speaker 7>If you're ever talking about something wouldn't be serious if it didn't have the</v>

1604
01:06:32.131 --> 01:06:34.830
<v Speaker 7>possibility of frightening and offending people.</v>

1605
01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:35.780
<v Speaker 7>That's kind of how the,</v>

1606
01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:38.310
<v Speaker 7>that's kind of like the definition of seriousness.</v>

1607
01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:38.671
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

1608
01:06:38.671 --> 01:06:38.821
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1609
01:06:38.821 --> 01:06:42.720
<v Speaker 7>we can only talk about things that no one ever gets upset about.</v>

1610
01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:43.291
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

1611
01:06:43.291 --> 01:06:44.124
<v Speaker 7>well</v>

1612
01:06:45.810 --> 01:06:48.240
<v Speaker 7>then it's like you're trapped in an elevator for,</v>

1613
01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:52.920
<v Speaker 7>for the rest of infinity listening to nothing but Muzak you're,</v>

1614
01:06:52.921 --> 01:06:53.670
<v Speaker 7>that's an,</v>

1615
01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:55.080
<v Speaker 7>that's a kind of hell man.</v>

1616
01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:56.460
<v Speaker 7>If you're going to think,</v>

1617
01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:58.080
<v Speaker 7>and also if you're going to speak,</v>

1618
01:06:58.350 --> 01:06:59.183
<v Speaker 7>you're going to,</v>

1619
01:06:59.310 --> 01:07:00.660
<v Speaker 7>you're going to offend people.</v>

1620
01:07:00.690 --> 01:07:04.530
<v Speaker 7>You're going to go after their deepest presuppositions and end your own as well.</v>

1621
01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:06.240
<v Speaker 7>You're going to shatter them at times.</v>

1622
01:07:06.241 --> 01:07:07.560
<v Speaker 7>It's going to be brutal.</v>

1623
01:07:07.650 --> 01:07:08.760
<v Speaker 7>Absolutely brutal.</v>

1624
01:07:08.970 --> 01:07:12.240
<v Speaker 7>And you all know that because every single one of you has had a serious</v>

1625
01:07:12.241 --> 01:07:16.110
<v Speaker 7>conversation with someone that you love and the probability that that was an</v>

1626
01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:20.820
<v Speaker 7>easy conversation and that either of you escaped without offense and terror is</v>

1627
01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:21.840
<v Speaker 7>zero.</v>

1628
01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:23.940
<v Speaker 7>If you haven't had a conversation like that,</v>

1629
01:07:23.941 --> 01:07:24.480
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1630
01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:25.313
<v Speaker 7>well</v>

1631
01:07:28.290 --> 01:07:29.220
<v Speaker 7>you're not human,</v>

1632
01:07:29.250 --> 01:07:29.630
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1633
01:07:29.630 --> 01:07:31.170
<v Speaker 7>I mean right.</v>

1634
01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:35.280
<v Speaker 7>Cause everyone has conversations like that all the time except when they run</v>

1635
01:07:35.281 --> 01:07:36.000
<v Speaker 7>from them,</v>

1636
01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.970
<v Speaker 7>which is most of the time and no bloody wonder,</v>

1637
01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:39.901
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1638
01:07:39.901 --> 01:07:44.610
<v Speaker 7>real conversations or there's nothing worse than a real conversation except the</v>

1639
01:07:44.611 --> 01:07:47.370
<v Speaker 7>war that you have if you don't have the conversation.</v>

1640
01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:49.290
<v Speaker 7>That's basically how it goes.</v>

1641
01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:50.490
<v Speaker 7>I just want to underline,</v>

1642
01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:59.300
<v Speaker 7>I just want to underline Jordan's first point,</v>

1643
01:08:00.230 --> 01:08:04.130
<v Speaker 7>which is really that it's a very dangerous thing.</v>

1644
01:08:05.030 --> 01:08:10.030
<v Speaker 7>Any legal rule that relies on some kind of reasonableness because reasonableness</v>

1645
01:08:11.211 --> 01:08:13.580
<v Speaker 7>lies in the eyes of the beholder.</v>

1646
01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:14.600
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1647
01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:16.250
<v Speaker 7>those out there</v>

1648
01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:19.910
<v Speaker 5>think that you guys are uttering hate speech.</v>

1649
01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:25.180
<v Speaker 5>They think that you guys should be the one who are arrested and just imagine if</v>

1650
01:08:25.221 --> 01:08:28.850
<v Speaker 5>they were the ones who had the reins of government power.</v>

1651
01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:33.650
<v Speaker 5>Just all very well hate speech as a reasonable idea.</v>

1652
01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:36.980
<v Speaker 5>But as soon as you give up the control about what that means,</v>

1653
01:08:37.460 --> 01:08:39.710
<v Speaker 5>you're liable to run into real trouble.</v>

1654
01:08:41.570 --> 01:08:42.403
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

1655
01:08:42.780 --> 01:08:42.990
<v Speaker 5>Hello,</v>

1656
01:08:42.990 --> 01:08:44.050
<v Speaker 5>Mr. Rowe.</v>

1657
01:08:44.190 --> 01:08:44.401
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

1658
01:08:44.401 --> 01:08:45.390
<v Speaker 8>Mr. Peterson,</v>

1659
01:08:45.510 --> 01:08:46.920
<v Speaker 8>my name is Zachary Milligan.</v>

1660
01:08:47.610 --> 01:08:47.911
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

1661
01:08:47.911 --> 01:08:48.451
<v Speaker 8>first off,</v>

1662
01:08:48.451 --> 01:08:53.010
<v Speaker 8>I'd just like to start to actually thank you for all the hardship and troubles</v>

1663
01:08:53.011 --> 01:08:57.570
<v Speaker 8>even dirt for standing up for our rights and being a part of this debate.</v>

1664
01:08:58.580 --> 01:08:59.413
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

1665
01:08:59.610 --> 01:09:03.720
<v Speaker 8>I come from a dairy farm and math need rural res conservatively.</v>

1666
01:09:03.721 --> 01:09:07.960
<v Speaker 8>And my question is in the face of when we have a social situation,</v>

1667
01:09:07.961 --> 01:09:08.970
<v Speaker 8>so divisive,</v>

1668
01:09:09.510 --> 01:09:12.480
<v Speaker 8>when you genuinely believe what you're doing is the right thing.</v>

1669
01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:14.040
<v Speaker 8>In this particular instance,</v>

1670
01:09:14.041 --> 01:09:15.390
<v Speaker 8>since you have experience with it,</v>

1671
01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:16.950
<v Speaker 8>what would you say?</v>

1672
01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:19.350
<v Speaker 8>Is there a more effective,</v>

1673
01:09:19.351 --> 01:09:21.990
<v Speaker 8>I don't want to say an easy way to reach out for them,</v>

1674
01:09:21.991 --> 01:09:25.980
<v Speaker 8>but what do you think's the best way to try and talk some sense into those folks</v>

1675
01:09:25.981 --> 01:09:27.720
<v Speaker 8>outside and the one on one setting?</v>

1676
01:09:28.190 --> 01:09:33.190
<v Speaker 7>So the first thing is is I don't necessarily the day I don't necessarily think</v>

1677
01:09:33.351 --> 01:09:36.500
<v Speaker 7>that what I'm doing is the right thing because you know,</v>

1678
01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:38.930
<v Speaker 7>you have to be careful when you make a claim like that.</v>

1679
01:09:38.931 --> 01:09:40.190
<v Speaker 7>But I can tell you one thing,</v>

1680
01:09:40.790 --> 01:09:45.790
<v Speaker 7>I'm not going to let anyone stand in the way of me trying to figure out what the</v>

1681
01:09:45.801 --> 01:09:46.910
<v Speaker 7>right thing is.</v>

1682
01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:48.290
<v Speaker 7>That's the thing.</v>

1683
01:09:57.090 --> 01:10:02.090
<v Speaker 7>And then I would say we're doing exactly what we should be doing right now in</v>

1684
01:10:02.161 --> 01:10:02.940
<v Speaker 7>this discussion.</v>

1685
01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:03.200
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>

1686
01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:04.620
<v Speaker 7>it's just exactly right,</v>

1687
01:10:05.130 --> 01:10:05.490
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1688
01:10:05.490 --> 01:10:06.323
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1689
01:10:07.470 --> 01:10:09.840
<v Speaker 7>admittedly we have to talk over the noise,</v>

1690
01:10:09.870 --> 01:10:14.100
<v Speaker 7>but that's really not that big a catastrophe and everybody's in here is</v>

1691
01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:16.110
<v Speaker 7>comporting themselves in a reasonable manner.</v>

1692
01:10:16.111 --> 01:10:19.410
<v Speaker 7>And we're trying to struggle our way through the topics and we're,</v>

1693
01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:21.020
<v Speaker 7>we're asking questions and we're,</v>

1694
01:10:21.150 --> 01:10:23.340
<v Speaker 7>we're trying to have a genuine dialogue about them.</v>

1695
01:10:23.341 --> 01:10:24.960
<v Speaker 7>And that's what we've got.</v>

1696
01:10:24.990 --> 01:10:25.823
<v Speaker 7>We've got,</v>

1697
01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:27.840
<v Speaker 7>we've got three things.</v>

1698
01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:30.300
<v Speaker 7>We've got negotiation,</v>

1699
01:10:31.530 --> 01:10:32.700
<v Speaker 7>we've got slavery,</v>

1700
01:10:33.210 --> 01:10:34.350
<v Speaker 7>and we've got tyranny.</v>

1701
01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:36.240
<v Speaker 7>And those are your choices.</v>

1702
01:10:36.930 --> 01:10:38.640
<v Speaker 7>And so this is negotiation,</v>

1703
01:10:38.641 --> 01:10:38.881
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1704
01:10:38.881 --> 01:10:40.050
<v Speaker 7>That's public discourse.</v>

1705
01:10:40.051 --> 01:10:43.620
<v Speaker 7>And the reason that freedom of speech thought is obviously important.</v>

1706
01:10:43.621 --> 01:10:44.820
<v Speaker 7>And everyone can understand that.</v>

1707
01:10:44.821 --> 01:10:45.241
<v Speaker 7>You might say,</v>

1708
01:10:45.241 --> 01:10:45.391
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1709
01:10:45.391 --> 01:10:48.990
<v Speaker 7>you don't need to speak freely because you can think who's going to get inside</v>

1710
01:10:48.991 --> 01:10:49.800
<v Speaker 7>your head.</v>

1711
01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:52.320
<v Speaker 7>But the problem with that is that that's not it.</v>

1712
01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:56.490
<v Speaker 7>You can't think very well because there you are and your little world,</v>

1713
01:10:56.491 --> 01:10:56.761
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1714
01:10:56.761 --> 01:10:58.980
<v Speaker 7>with all your biases and your ignorance,</v>

1715
01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:02.520
<v Speaker 7>you're wrong about so many things and you're going to learn it really painfully.</v>

1716
01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:03.270
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>

1717
01:11:03.270 --> 01:11:07.230
<v Speaker 7>and then maybe you can trot out some of the things you think erroneously and</v>

1718
01:11:07.231 --> 01:11:10.710
<v Speaker 7>ignorantly and other people will give you a tap on the side of the head instead</v>

1719
01:11:10.711 --> 01:11:12.570
<v Speaker 7>of running you over with a freight train,</v>

1720
01:11:12.571 --> 01:11:13.050
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1721
01:11:13.050 --> 01:11:15.660
<v Speaker 7>They'll give you a little tap on the side of the head and maybe you'll walk away</v>

1722
01:11:15.661 --> 01:11:16.620
<v Speaker 7>a little smarter.</v>

1723
01:11:16.830 --> 01:11:19.000
<v Speaker 7>And that's why freedom of speech is so important,</v>

1724
01:11:19.001 --> 01:11:20.700
<v Speaker 7>just because a lot of thinking,</v>

1725
01:11:20.730 --> 01:11:24.270
<v Speaker 7>especially about things that are beyond you for whatever reason,</v>

1726
01:11:24.271 --> 01:11:29.271
<v Speaker 7>have to take place publicly as we stumble around towards an adequate formulation</v>

1727
01:11:29.461 --> 01:11:31.170
<v Speaker 7>of the problems that beset us.</v>

1728
01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:32.611
<v Speaker 7>So I would say,</v>

1729
01:11:32.611 --> 01:11:34.890
<v Speaker 7>well in this book I wrote,</v>

1730
01:11:35.070 --> 01:11:35.910
<v Speaker 7>I have a rule.</v>

1731
01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:36.890
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>

1732
01:11:36.890 --> 01:11:41.040
<v Speaker 7>I think it's rule eight which is tell the truth or at least don't lie.</v>

1733
01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:41.701
<v Speaker 7>I would say,</v>

1734
01:11:41.701 --> 01:11:41.851
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1735
01:11:41.851 --> 01:11:43.470
<v Speaker 7>that's another reasonable,</v>

1736
01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:48.480
<v Speaker 7>a reasonable way to start approaching the situation is it's not so easy to tell</v>

1737
01:11:48.481 --> 01:11:49.560
<v Speaker 7>the truth because like,</v>

1738
01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:50.453
<v Speaker 7>what do you know?</v>

1739
01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:51.240
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

1740
01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:52.230
<v Speaker 7>you can't come out and say,</v>

1741
01:11:52.231 --> 01:11:52.351
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1742
01:11:52.351 --> 01:11:53.184
<v Speaker 7>here's the truth,</v>

1743
01:11:53.310 --> 01:11:55.200
<v Speaker 7>but I know what one thing you can do,</v>

1744
01:11:55.201 --> 01:11:59.640
<v Speaker 7>which is when you know that what you're saying is a lie by your own standards,</v>

1745
01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:04.350
<v Speaker 7>you can not say it and you can have a consultation with yourself and you can try</v>

1746
01:12:04.351 --> 01:12:07.620
<v Speaker 7>to learn to say those things that make you strong.</v>

1747
01:12:07.830 --> 01:12:11.120
<v Speaker 7>Instead of saying those things that make you weak and you,</v>

1748
01:12:11.121 --> 01:12:15.810
<v Speaker 7>you contribute to the health of the public dialogue in an incalculable manner</v>

1749
01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:16.710
<v Speaker 7>that way.</v>

1750
01:12:16.710 --> 01:12:20.550
<v Speaker 7>And this is another issue that pertains to the dignity and importance of the</v>

1751
01:12:20.551 --> 01:12:21.300
<v Speaker 7>individual.</v>

1752
01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:25.140
<v Speaker 7>How you conduct yourself in your life is way more important than you think.</v>

1753
01:12:25.890 --> 01:12:26.130
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>

1754
01:12:26.130 --> 01:12:29.570
<v Speaker 7>and I mean I think that that's a daunting idea because you know,</v>

1755
01:12:29.580 --> 01:12:32.020
<v Speaker 7>let's say you're nihilistic and life is meaningless.</v>

1756
01:12:32.021 --> 01:12:32.191
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>

1757
01:12:32.191 --> 01:12:32.311
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1758
01:12:32.311 --> 01:12:33.660
<v Speaker 7>what's the payoff for that?</v>

1759
01:12:34.190 --> 01:12:34.441
<v Speaker 7>I think,</v>

1760
01:12:34.441 --> 01:12:34.591
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1761
01:12:34.591 --> 01:12:35.470
<v Speaker 7>there's no payoff.</v>

1762
01:12:35.490 --> 01:12:35.821
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

1763
01:12:35.821 --> 01:12:35.971
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1764
01:12:35.971 --> 01:12:36.241
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

1765
01:12:36.241 --> 01:12:36.661
<v Speaker 7>there is,</v>

1766
01:12:36.661 --> 01:12:38.070
<v Speaker 7>you have no responsibility.</v>

1767
01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:39.930
<v Speaker 7>That's a pretty decent pay off.</v>

1768
01:12:39.931 --> 01:12:40.111
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1769
01:12:40.111 --> 01:12:41.850
<v Speaker 7>you have to pay the price of meaninglessness,</v>

1770
01:12:41.851 --> 01:12:43.620
<v Speaker 7>but it doesn't matter what you do.</v>

1771
01:12:43.890 --> 01:12:44.071
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1772
01:12:44.071 --> 01:12:45.230
<v Speaker 7>we'll flip that over and said,</v>

1773
01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:45.421
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

1774
01:12:45.421 --> 01:12:46.140
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

1775
01:12:46.140 --> 01:12:46.973
<v Speaker 7>sorry,</v>

1776
01:12:47.010 --> 01:12:48.030
<v Speaker 7>you're wrong.</v>

1777
01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:49.620
<v Speaker 7>Your life is meaningful.</v>

1778
01:12:49.650 --> 01:12:51.270
<v Speaker 7>It's way more meaningful than you think,</v>

1779
01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:55.260
<v Speaker 7>but you have to bear responsibility for your thoughts and your actions.</v>

1780
01:12:55.910 --> 01:12:56.401
<v Speaker 7>It's like you'll,</v>

1781
01:12:56.401 --> 01:13:00.270
<v Speaker 7>there'll be plenty of meaning and not well that if you understand that property,</v>

1782
01:13:00.271 --> 01:13:00.810
<v Speaker 7>that will,</v>

1783
01:13:00.810 --> 01:13:05.520
<v Speaker 7>that will cleave you to the depths of your soul and maybe you learn to speak</v>

1784
01:13:05.521 --> 01:13:09.180
<v Speaker 7>carefully at the act carefully and that will have a beneficial effect on</v>

1785
01:13:09.181 --> 01:13:11.610
<v Speaker 7>everyone around you if far more.</v>

1786
01:13:11.610 --> 01:13:15.660
<v Speaker 7>You're far more powerful in the place you stand in the place you sit and stand</v>

1787
01:13:15.661 --> 01:13:16.440
<v Speaker 7>than you think.</v>

1788
01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:18.600
<v Speaker 7>And I think everyone has an intimation of that.</v>

1789
01:13:18.810 --> 01:13:20.430
<v Speaker 7>And if you don't think that's true,</v>

1790
01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:24.390
<v Speaker 7>then try treating people around you as if it's not true.</v>

1791
01:13:24.870 --> 01:13:29.100
<v Speaker 7>Tried treating people that you know in your life as if they don't matter and</v>

1792
01:13:29.101 --> 01:13:31.170
<v Speaker 7>just see what kind of response you get.</v>

1793
01:13:31.590 --> 01:13:33.450
<v Speaker 7>People are not going to be happy with you,</v>

1794
01:13:33.451 --> 01:13:35.040
<v Speaker 7>not in any sense whatsoever.</v>

1795
01:13:35.041 --> 01:13:35.490
<v Speaker 7>You'll,</v>

1796
01:13:35.490 --> 01:13:37.200
<v Speaker 7>you'll ruin all your relationships.</v>

1797
01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:39.540
<v Speaker 7>You have to treat people as if they matter.</v>

1798
01:13:39.690 --> 01:13:43.440
<v Speaker 7>And maybe you have to treat them as if they matter because maybe they do.</v>

1799
01:13:44.010 --> 01:13:45.450
<v Speaker 7>And that goes for you too.</v>

1800
01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:47.410
<v Speaker 7>And so if you matter,</v>

1801
01:13:47.411 --> 01:13:49.070
<v Speaker 7>then you should act like you matter.</v>

1802
01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:50.453
<v Speaker 7>And that's a very,</v>

1803
01:13:51.210 --> 01:13:53.040
<v Speaker 7>that's a very daunting proposition.</v>

1804
01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:54.053
<v Speaker 7>That's for sure.</v>

1805
01:13:54.810 --> 01:13:55.470
<v Speaker 7>As a foot.</v>

1806
01:13:55.470 --> 01:13:56.303
<v Speaker 7>Go ahead.</v>

1807
01:13:56.330 --> 01:13:57.163
<v Speaker 1>As a,</v>

1808
01:14:04.150 --> 01:14:05.590
<v Speaker 7>it's just a footnote to that.</v>

1809
01:14:05.620 --> 01:14:08.050
<v Speaker 7>Let's just observe this in legal terms.</v>

1810
01:14:08.770 --> 01:14:12.370
<v Speaker 7>There are only two categories of actions,</v>

1811
01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:15.030
<v Speaker 5>voluntary and involuntary.</v>

1812
01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:17.170
<v Speaker 5>Don't let anybody tell you otherwise,</v>

1813
01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:20.330
<v Speaker 5>either you're choosing on your own and,</v>

1814
01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:24.040
<v Speaker 5>and handling the consequences or the government is telling you what to do.</v>

1815
01:14:24.730 --> 01:14:26.170
<v Speaker 5>Those are the only two possibilities.</v>

1816
01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:28.071
<v Speaker 8>Thank you,</v>

1817
01:14:28.071 --> 01:14:28.904
<v Speaker 8>sir.</v>

1818
01:14:35.290 --> 01:14:35.690
<v Speaker 1>At the back.</v>

1819
01:14:35.690 --> 01:14:36.523
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead.</v>

1820
01:14:37.150 --> 01:14:37.983
<v Speaker 8>Oh Duh.</v>

1821
01:14:38.050 --> 01:14:38.231
<v Speaker 8>Hello,</v>

1822
01:14:38.231 --> 01:14:39.130
<v Speaker 8>Dr. Peterson.</v>

1823
01:14:40.180 --> 01:14:45.040
<v Speaker 8>I would like to recall the part in your conversation in which you mentioned how</v>

1824
01:14:45.041 --> 01:14:50.041
<v Speaker 8>the radical left switched from the 1960s and seventies to being pro back when</v>

1825
01:14:50.921 --> 01:14:54.250
<v Speaker 8>they were a pro free speech and their recent,</v>

1826
01:14:55.210 --> 01:14:55.690
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

1827
01:14:55.690 --> 01:14:56.770
<v Speaker 8>opposition to it.</v>

1828
01:14:58.060 --> 01:14:58.893
<v Speaker 8>I know,</v>

1829
01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:02.080
<v Speaker 8>I know that you often mentioned their obsession with power,</v>

1830
01:15:02.081 --> 01:15:03.250
<v Speaker 8>at least among them.</v>

1831
01:15:04.540 --> 01:15:05.373
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>

1832
01:15:05.490 --> 01:15:07.630
<v Speaker 8>At least among their more Marxists types.</v>

1833
01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:09.340
<v Speaker 8>I was one,</v>

1834
01:15:09.340 --> 01:15:09.500
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

1835
01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:09.851
<v Speaker 8>I'm doing,</v>

1836
01:15:09.851 --> 01:15:11.920
<v Speaker 8>if perhaps they think that now,</v>

1837
01:15:12.370 --> 01:15:16.570
<v Speaker 8>now is the opportunity where they can consolidate their power and if they do so</v>

1838
01:15:16.571 --> 01:15:21.571
<v Speaker 8>successfully that it will become the mortality of our civilization for the next</v>

1839
01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:23.050
<v Speaker 8>thousand years.</v>

1840
01:15:23.050 --> 01:15:25.400
<v Speaker 8>Like Christianity was when Rome adopted.</v>

1841
01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:28.690
<v Speaker 8>Is that from what you've seen,</v>

1842
01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:31.710
<v Speaker 8>would you say that that's about it,</v>

1843
01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:36.340
<v Speaker 8>that that's close to the way there that's close to their strategy?</v>

1844
01:15:39.110 --> 01:15:39.291
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1845
01:15:39.291 --> 01:15:44.291
<v Speaker 7>it's hard to exactly understand the strategy of an ideology,</v>

1846
01:15:44.990 --> 01:15:45.291
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1847
01:15:45.291 --> 01:15:48.890
<v Speaker 7>because well all the people who were outside were,</v>

1848
01:15:48.980 --> 01:15:53.980
<v Speaker 7>were United in some sense under the umbrella of an idea and on an idea is a</v>

1849
01:15:54.351 --> 01:15:55.184
<v Speaker 7>living thing.</v>

1850
01:15:55.970 --> 01:16:00.800
<v Speaker 7>I mean it's embedded in living tissue and it's distributed in the fragmentary</v>

1851
01:16:00.801 --> 01:16:02.210
<v Speaker 7>manner across the mob,</v>

1852
01:16:02.211 --> 01:16:03.044
<v Speaker 7>let's say.</v>

1853
01:16:03.290 --> 01:16:08.290
<v Speaker 7>And each person in the mob always only only possess is a fragment of the</v>

1854
01:16:09.171 --> 01:16:12.200
<v Speaker 7>ideology because the full neo Marxist,</v>

1855
01:16:12.230 --> 01:16:16.520
<v Speaker 7>let's say the full neo Marxist postmodernist doctrine is quite complex.</v>

1856
01:16:16.521 --> 01:16:17.270
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>

1857
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.900
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>

1858
01:16:17.900 --> 01:16:19.400
<v Speaker 7>but when you get the mob together,</v>

1859
01:16:19.401 --> 01:16:22.340
<v Speaker 7>then it acts under the dictate of the ideology.</v>

1860
01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:24.260
<v Speaker 7>And the question then is,</v>

1861
01:16:24.261 --> 01:16:24.411
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1862
01:16:24.411 --> 01:16:26.030
<v Speaker 7>what does the ideology want?</v>

1863
01:16:26.570 --> 01:16:27.231
<v Speaker 7>And I would say,</v>

1864
01:16:27.231 --> 01:16:27.441
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1865
01:16:27.441 --> 01:16:30.560
<v Speaker 7>it wants what it's formulators says it wants.</v>

1866
01:16:30.890 --> 01:16:32.480
<v Speaker 7>And D Derrida for example,</v>

1867
01:16:32.481 --> 01:16:37.400
<v Speaker 7>who's head trickster of the postmodernists regarded the western society as</v>

1868
01:16:37.401 --> 01:16:38.690
<v Speaker 7>fellow go centric.</v>

1869
01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:39.460
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

1870
01:16:39.460 --> 01:16:41.330
<v Speaker 7>And North that meant was male dominant,</v>

1871
01:16:41.420 --> 01:16:42.410
<v Speaker 7>male dominated.</v>

1872
01:16:42.411 --> 01:16:44.180
<v Speaker 7>That's the fellow fellas part.</v>

1873
01:16:44.450 --> 01:16:45.680
<v Speaker 7>And then logo centric.</v>

1874
01:16:45.681 --> 01:16:47.420
<v Speaker 7>While that refers to the word logos,</v>

1875
01:16:47.421 --> 01:16:49.040
<v Speaker 7>which means it's the root word of logic,</v>

1876
01:16:49.041 --> 01:16:50.390
<v Speaker 7>but there's also the,</v>

1877
01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:51.513
<v Speaker 7>it's also the,</v>

1878
01:16:51.790 --> 01:16:53.450
<v Speaker 7>the person of Christ,</v>

1879
01:16:53.451 --> 01:16:54.770
<v Speaker 7>essentially the logos.</v>

1880
01:16:55.190 --> 01:17:00.190
<v Speaker 7>And so the purpose of the postmodern critique was to demolish that wealth.</v>

1881
01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:02.151
<v Speaker 7>Fair enough.</v>

1882
01:17:02.151 --> 01:17:03.530
<v Speaker 7>My sense with people is,</v>

1883
01:17:03.740 --> 01:17:04.640
<v Speaker 7>especially if they're,</v>

1884
01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:08.720
<v Speaker 7>if they've written things down and thought them through that they're actually</v>

1885
01:17:08.721 --> 01:17:10.280
<v Speaker 7>aiming for what they say</v>

1886
01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:11.300
<v Speaker 10>they're aiming for.</v>

1887
01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:12.381
<v Speaker 10>Well,</v>

1888
01:17:12.381 --> 01:17:12.860
<v Speaker 10>if you,</v>

1889
01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:17.860
<v Speaker 10>if you buy the idea that the west is a male dominated tyranny,</v>

1890
01:17:18.651 --> 01:17:20.450
<v Speaker 10>essentially a patriarchal tyranny,</v>

1891
01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:23.360
<v Speaker 10>and that your moral duty is to tear it down,</v>

1892
01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:25.520
<v Speaker 10>well then that's what you're doing.</v>

1893
01:17:26.420 --> 01:17:27.141
<v Speaker 10>And then you might say,</v>

1894
01:17:27.141 --> 01:17:27.291
<v Speaker 10>well,</v>

1895
01:17:27.291 --> 01:17:27.980
<v Speaker 10>what's going to,</v>

1896
01:17:27.980 --> 01:17:30.440
<v Speaker 10>what is going to be erected on its ashes?</v>

1897
01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:31.160
<v Speaker 10>Well,</v>

1898
01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:32.930
<v Speaker 10>that's where things get complicated.</v>

1899
01:17:33.650 --> 01:17:34.430
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>

1900
01:17:34.430 --> 01:17:36.080
<v Speaker 10>the first question might be,</v>

1901
01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:38.510
<v Speaker 10>are the people who wish to tear it down?</v>

1902
01:17:38.511 --> 01:17:39.150
<v Speaker 10>Builders,</v>

1903
01:17:39.150 --> 01:17:41.210
<v Speaker 10>or are they just destroyers?</v>

1904
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:45.260
<v Speaker 10>And my strong sentiment is that they're primarily destroyers.</v>

1905
01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:47.421
<v Speaker 10>Now you might say,</v>

1906
01:17:47.421 --> 01:17:47.601
<v Speaker 10>well,</v>

1907
01:17:47.601 --> 01:17:49.400
<v Speaker 10>why do people wish to destroy?</v>

1908
01:17:50.150 --> 01:17:50.301
<v Speaker 10>Well,</v>

1909
01:17:50.301 --> 01:17:52.790
<v Speaker 10>it's because they're hurt by life and they're resentful</v>

1910
01:17:54.310 --> 01:17:55.031
<v Speaker 10>and resentful.</v>

1911
01:17:55.031 --> 01:17:58.390
<v Speaker 10>People become vengeful and vengeful.</v>

1912
01:17:58.391 --> 01:17:59.980
<v Speaker 10>People become dangerous.</v>

1913
01:18:00.610 --> 01:18:03.850
<v Speaker 10>And there's no shortage of motivation to make things worse.</v>

1914
01:18:05.230 --> 01:18:07.480
<v Speaker 10>Now that the school shooters make things worse,</v>

1915
01:18:08.230 --> 01:18:09.850
<v Speaker 10>people make things worse.</v>

1916
01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:11.141
<v Speaker 10>Now,</v>

1917
01:18:11.141 --> 01:18:11.381
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

1918
01:18:11.381 --> 01:18:15.760
<v Speaker 10>maybe lurking in the rhetoric is this appealed to an egalitarian utopia,</v>

1919
01:18:15.820 --> 01:18:20.440
<v Speaker 10>but we've tried utilitarian utopia is already,</v>

1920
01:18:21.790 --> 01:18:25.690
<v Speaker 10>we sacrificed 100 million people to [inaudible] Galitary in utopias,</v>

1921
01:18:25.870 --> 01:18:27.670
<v Speaker 10>and we have yet to produce one.</v>

1922
01:18:28.390 --> 01:18:33.040
<v Speaker 10>And so my sense is the corpse is stacked up high enough to constitute proof.</v>

1923
01:18:34.690 --> 01:18:35.523
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1924
01:18:36.390 --> 01:18:39.720
<v Speaker 10>it's destruction mostly that motivates it as far as I can tell,</v>

1925
01:18:39.750 --> 01:18:41.310
<v Speaker 10>masquerading as compassion.</v>

1926
01:18:44.750 --> 01:18:49.750
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

1927
01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:54.280
<v Speaker 11>thank you for that question.</v>

1928
01:18:54.340 --> 01:18:55.173
<v Speaker 11>Next place.</v>

1929
01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:56.350
<v Speaker 11>Dr. Peterson.</v>

1930
01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:57.101
<v Speaker 11>I said party.</v>

1931
01:18:57.101 --> 01:18:58.540
<v Speaker 11>Thank you both for being here today.</v>

1932
01:18:59.310 --> 01:18:59.800
<v Speaker 11>Um,</v>

1933
01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:03.370
<v Speaker 11>I'm a political scientist and what I've studied is totalitarian regimes.</v>

1934
01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:03.641
<v Speaker 11>I'm sorry,</v>

1935
01:19:03.641 --> 01:19:04.480
<v Speaker 11>I'm gonna move this a little bit.</v>

1936
01:19:04.580 --> 01:19:05.413
<v Speaker 11>To feel weird.</v>

1937
01:19:05.830 --> 01:19:06.551
<v Speaker 11>Totalitarian regimes.</v>

1938
01:19:06.551 --> 01:19:06.971
<v Speaker 11>I've studied,</v>

1939
01:19:06.971 --> 01:19:10.630
<v Speaker 11>I've tried to look at the Iranian revolution and the Islamic Republican,</v>

1940
01:19:10.631 --> 01:19:11.200
<v Speaker 11>Iran,</v>

1941
01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:15.580
<v Speaker 11>and I've argued how the Shia Islam that is teached in Islamic public is very</v>

1942
01:19:15.581 --> 01:19:17.080
<v Speaker 11>close to a totalitarian regime.</v>

1943
01:19:17.710 --> 01:19:21.250
<v Speaker 11>But now I live in a country where my ideas are considered controversial.</v>

1944
01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:23.140
<v Speaker 11>If you believe in God,</v>

1945
01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:24.250
<v Speaker 11>if you believe in family,</v>

1946
01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:27.280
<v Speaker 11>if you believe in having responsibility and traditional values,</v>

1947
01:19:27.490 --> 01:19:29.560
<v Speaker 11>I feel ostracized by the community here.</v>

1948
01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:30.880
<v Speaker 11>I came from UFC,</v>

1949
01:19:30.881 --> 01:19:31.960
<v Speaker 11>university of Calgary over there,</v>

1950
01:19:31.961 --> 01:19:32.830
<v Speaker 11>I didn't feel this way.</v>

1951
01:19:33.010 --> 01:19:33.970
<v Speaker 11>There was more welcoming.</v>

1952
01:19:33.971 --> 01:19:37.120
<v Speaker 11>Here I feel marginalized and I do feel alone.</v>

1953
01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:38.470
<v Speaker 11>And when I see this,</v>

1954
01:19:38.471 --> 01:19:40.570
<v Speaker 11>it disgusts me that here they can do this.</v>

1955
01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:42.580
<v Speaker 11>But I couldn't go to their events and do anything.</v>

1956
01:19:42.940 --> 01:19:43.631
<v Speaker 11>I'd have to shut up,</v>

1957
01:19:43.631 --> 01:19:45.310
<v Speaker 11>there'd be disciplinary committee for me.</v>

1958
01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:49.000
<v Speaker 11>But for them they can break windows to God knows how old this building is.</v>

1959
01:19:49.090 --> 01:19:50.380
<v Speaker 11>And it's okay for them to do that.</v>

1960
01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:52.970
<v Speaker 11>So my question to you is now being sheer,</v>

1961
01:19:52.971 --> 01:19:53.950
<v Speaker 11>experiencing this,</v>

1962
01:19:54.550 --> 01:19:58.570
<v Speaker 11>I'm starting to second guess that maybe the totalitarian Islamic regime that I</v>

1963
01:19:58.571 --> 01:19:59.320
<v Speaker 11>was so,</v>

1964
01:19:59.320 --> 01:19:59.650
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>

1965
01:19:59.650 --> 01:20:03.220
<v Speaker 11>talking about and critical of back in Iran isn't so bad.</v>

1966
01:20:03.221 --> 01:20:07.080
<v Speaker 11>When I have a choice between having to be here and be depressed and be there and</v>

1967
01:20:07.081 --> 01:20:09.600
<v Speaker 11>at least have my ideas be okay with Lou regime.</v>

1968
01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:14.430
<v Speaker 11>So my argument is if this free speech and the arguments you're guys are making</v>

1969
01:20:14.431 --> 01:20:15.020
<v Speaker 11>here,</v>

1970
01:20:15.020 --> 01:20:16.020
<v Speaker 11>it doesn't work.</v>

1971
01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:19.590
<v Speaker 11>Would that not be the next step for people to go towards totalitarianism?</v>

1972
01:20:19.770 --> 01:20:22.950
<v Speaker 11>If dialogue fails and isn't force of arms the only thing left?</v>

1973
01:20:23.190 --> 01:20:25.650
<v Speaker 11>How can people compromise when they don't want to talk,</v>

1974
01:20:25.710 --> 01:20:26.670
<v Speaker 11>when they want to yell?</v>

1975
01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:28.673
<v Speaker 11>Thank you.</v>

1976
01:20:35.330 --> 01:20:36.163
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1977
01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:39.190
<v Speaker 5>I think you make it very good point.</v>

1978
01:20:39.220 --> 01:20:41.560
<v Speaker 5>I don't think we should fool ourselves.</v>

1979
01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:46.560
<v Speaker 5>This is about force and it is a,</v>

1980
01:20:46.570 --> 01:20:51.570
<v Speaker 5>it's almost a dare to suggest that that certain elements are not allowed to</v>

1981
01:20:54.341 --> 01:20:58.780
<v Speaker 5>enforce their view of the world and that speaking contrary to it,</v>

1982
01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:01.620
<v Speaker 5>isn't that a front to those values and they won't shut you down.</v>

1983
01:21:01.690 --> 01:21:02.190
<v Speaker 5>I mean that,</v>

1984
01:21:02.190 --> 01:21:03.820
<v Speaker 5>that that is what is at stake.</v>

1985
01:21:04.070 --> 01:21:04.390
<v Speaker 5>We,</v>

1986
01:21:04.390 --> 01:21:04.631
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

1987
01:21:04.631 --> 01:21:05.400
<v Speaker 5>we are,</v>

1988
01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:05.860
<v Speaker 5>we are.</v>

1989
01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:10.860
<v Speaker 5>We are no longer really in a situation where this will all be resolved through</v>

1990
01:21:12.340 --> 01:21:13.780
<v Speaker 5>sort of gentle,</v>

1991
01:21:13.781 --> 01:21:15.610
<v Speaker 5>reasonable civil dialogue</v>

1992
01:21:17.490 --> 01:21:18.760
<v Speaker 5>that happens on the side,</v>

1993
01:21:18.761 --> 01:21:20.260
<v Speaker 5>but it's not real anymore.</v>

1994
01:21:20.261 --> 01:21:21.970
<v Speaker 5>It's not really where the fight is happening.</v>

1995
01:21:22.270 --> 01:21:22.910
<v Speaker 5>This is a,</v>

1996
01:21:22.910 --> 01:21:27.400
<v Speaker 5>an imposition of the force of the state and it is skewed.</v>

1997
01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:31.690
<v Speaker 5>It's skewed a certain way and we're getting to the point where a certain kind of</v>

1998
01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:32.621
<v Speaker 5>language,</v>

1999
01:21:32.621 --> 01:21:32.990
<v Speaker 5>a curtain,</v>

2000
01:21:32.990 --> 01:21:34.460
<v Speaker 5>certain kind of dialogue is,</v>

2001
01:21:34.570 --> 01:21:37.090
<v Speaker 5>is approved and all right and a certain kind.</v>

2002
01:21:37.091 --> 01:21:37.811
<v Speaker 5>It is not.</v>

2003
01:21:37.811 --> 01:21:40.990
<v Speaker 5>And that is the campaign that is going on that this is all part of.</v>

2004
01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:43.990
<v Speaker 5>And I have to say that,</v>

2005
01:21:43.991 --> 01:21:46.150
<v Speaker 5>that your presence here and,</v>

2006
01:21:46.180 --> 01:21:51.180
<v Speaker 5>and your endorsement of this kind of event is the kind of thing that has the</v>

2007
01:21:51.581 --> 01:21:54.460
<v Speaker 5>major pushback to that trend.</v>

2008
01:21:54.490 --> 01:21:57.580
<v Speaker 5>But the trend is continuing and is a very dangerous one.</v>

2009
01:21:58.120 --> 01:21:59.250
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

2010
01:21:59.590 --> 01:21:59.951
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>

2011
01:21:59.951 --> 01:22:00.440
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2012
01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:04.030
<v Speaker 5>a difficult moment in the life of this country.</v>

2013
01:22:04.090 --> 01:22:04.510
<v Speaker 5>Would you,</v>

2014
01:22:04.510 --> 01:22:05.343
<v Speaker 5>would you say</v>

2015
01:22:05.370 --> 01:22:06.220
<v Speaker 10>Jordan Peele?</v>

2016
01:22:06.630 --> 01:22:07.140
<v Speaker 10>So,</v>

2017
01:22:07.140 --> 01:22:07.973
<v Speaker 10>so some,</v>

2018
01:22:08.010 --> 01:22:09.240
<v Speaker 10>some comments about,</v>

2019
01:22:09.270 --> 01:22:10.230
<v Speaker 10>about your career,</v>

2020
01:22:10.231 --> 01:22:10.651
<v Speaker 10>let's say.</v>

2021
01:22:10.651 --> 01:22:10.921
<v Speaker 10>Okay,</v>

2022
01:22:10.921 --> 01:22:13.560
<v Speaker 10>so you're a young mountain and you've got lots of years ahead of you.</v>

2023
01:22:13.561 --> 01:22:14.394
<v Speaker 10>So you know,</v>

2024
01:22:14.490 --> 01:22:17.010
<v Speaker 10>you want to prepare for the war and not for the battle,</v>

2025
01:22:17.550 --> 01:22:18.383
<v Speaker 10>right?</v>

2026
01:22:18.510 --> 01:22:18.751
<v Speaker 10>Okay.</v>

2027
01:22:18.751 --> 01:22:22.050
<v Speaker 10>Cause there's going to be many battles for you personally and perhaps</v>

2028
01:22:22.051 --> 01:22:23.130
<v Speaker 10>politically and all of that.</v>

2029
01:22:23.131 --> 01:22:26.550
<v Speaker 10>And so you want to make yourself as articulate and educated as you can and you</v>

2030
01:22:26.551 --> 01:22:27.540
<v Speaker 10>want to have patients.</v>

2031
01:22:27.900 --> 01:22:30.720
<v Speaker 10>I wouldn't say that there is no cause for despair,</v>

2032
01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:31.651
<v Speaker 10>you know?</v>

2033
01:22:31.651 --> 01:22:36.240
<v Speaker 10>I believe that the people who are attempting to radicalize our society and to</v>

2034
01:22:36.241 --> 01:22:39.930
<v Speaker 10>transform it into a battleground of identity politics are in a distinct</v>

2035
01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:40.793
<v Speaker 10>minority,</v>

2036
01:22:41.580 --> 01:22:42.990
<v Speaker 10>and I think that,</v>

2037
01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:46.960
<v Speaker 10>I think that there's no reason to assume that we can't push the devil back into</v>

2038
01:22:46.961 --> 01:22:47.460
<v Speaker 10>the,</v>

2039
01:22:47.460 --> 01:22:48.480
<v Speaker 10>into the bottle,</v>

2040
01:22:48.540 --> 01:22:49.171
<v Speaker 10>so to speak,</v>

2041
01:22:49.171 --> 01:22:51.210
<v Speaker 10>to push the genie back into the bottle,</v>

2042
01:22:51.690 --> 01:22:53.430
<v Speaker 10>and so don't despair.</v>

2043
01:22:53.910 --> 01:22:55.740
<v Speaker 10>Now from a personal perspective,</v>

2044
01:22:55.741 --> 01:22:59.880
<v Speaker 10>it's like we've got lots of things to learn and you've got lots of things to say</v>

2045
01:22:59.881 --> 01:23:04.200
<v Speaker 10>and to write and you're going to find now and then that you were imposed upon in</v>

2046
01:23:04.201 --> 01:23:06.190
<v Speaker 10>a manner that you don't find tolerable.</v>

2047
01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:06.611
<v Speaker 10>Right?</v>

2048
01:23:06.611 --> 01:23:06.971
<v Speaker 10>You think,</v>

2049
01:23:06.971 --> 01:23:08.140
<v Speaker 10>I can't live like this,</v>

2050
01:23:08.141 --> 01:23:08.351
<v Speaker 10>right?</v>

2051
01:23:08.351 --> 01:23:10.450
<v Speaker 10>It's going to distress you and well then,</v>

2052
01:23:10.690 --> 01:23:13.120
<v Speaker 10>then you've come across your moral conundrum,</v>

2053
01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:13.841
<v Speaker 10>right?</v>

2054
01:23:13.841 --> 01:23:16.360
<v Speaker 10>It's specific to you and then you have to,</v>

2055
01:23:16.510 --> 01:23:20.140
<v Speaker 10>that's when you have to grow up and think strategically.</v>

2056
01:23:20.410 --> 01:23:24.160
<v Speaker 10>It's like you decide are you willing to live under those conditions?</v>

2057
01:23:24.310 --> 01:23:25.150
<v Speaker 10>If you're not,</v>

2058
01:23:25.180 --> 01:23:27.340
<v Speaker 10>then you develop a strategy.</v>

2059
01:23:27.550 --> 01:23:27.910
<v Speaker 10>It's like,</v>

2060
01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:28.660
<v Speaker 10>okay,</v>

2061
01:23:28.660 --> 01:23:29.493
<v Speaker 10>I'm going to,</v>

2062
01:23:29.710 --> 01:23:31.600
<v Speaker 10>I'm going to fight this.</v>

2063
01:23:32.290 --> 01:23:34.150
<v Speaker 10>I'm going to fight it carefully,</v>

2064
01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:35.800
<v Speaker 10>intelligently,</v>

2065
01:23:36.100 --> 01:23:40.240
<v Speaker 10>thoughtfully on multiple fronts and I'm not going to back down.</v>

2066
01:23:40.500 --> 01:23:42.310
<v Speaker 10>You don't make that decision lightly.</v>

2067
01:23:42.340 --> 01:23:46.570
<v Speaker 10>You know most things you should let blow by you because there's not that much of</v>

2068
01:23:46.571 --> 01:23:48.070
<v Speaker 10>you and there's lots of things,</v>

2069
01:23:48.310 --> 01:23:51.390
<v Speaker 10>but now and then you'll find a stumbling block that you can't get over it</v>

2070
01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:52.420
<v Speaker 10>because it hurts you.</v>

2071
01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:54.580
<v Speaker 10>It damages your soul.</v>

2072
01:23:54.581 --> 01:23:55.930
<v Speaker 10>That's the right way to think about it.</v>

2073
01:23:56.170 --> 01:23:59.560
<v Speaker 10>Well then that's the time for you to put your education to use.</v>

2074
01:23:59.810 --> 01:24:00.201
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>

2075
01:24:00.201 --> 01:24:01.510
<v Speaker 10>and you'll be able to do that.</v>

2076
01:24:01.540 --> 01:24:02.110
<v Speaker 10>I mean,</v>

2077
01:24:02.110 --> 01:24:05.890
<v Speaker 10>you don't want to underestimate the utility of of deep,</v>

2078
01:24:05.891 --> 01:24:07.330
<v Speaker 10>forthright speech.</v>

2079
01:24:07.510 --> 01:24:10.180
<v Speaker 10>I don't believe that anything can stand in its way.</v>

2080
01:24:10.390 --> 01:24:12.040
<v Speaker 10>You have the courage of your convictions,</v>

2081
01:24:12.041 --> 01:24:13.840
<v Speaker 10>but don't give way to despair.</v>

2082
01:24:13.870 --> 01:24:16.600
<v Speaker 10>Like this battle is by no means over.</v>

2083
01:24:16.950 --> 01:24:17.230
<v Speaker 10>Nope.</v>

2084
01:24:17.230 --> 01:24:20.560
<v Speaker 10>I know meat and it isn't even obvious that the bad guys are winning,</v>

2085
01:24:20.561 --> 01:24:21.400
<v Speaker 10>so to speak.</v>

2086
01:24:21.820 --> 01:24:22.420
<v Speaker 10>You know?</v>

2087
01:24:22.420 --> 01:24:22.661
<v Speaker 10>I mean,</v>

2088
01:24:22.661 --> 01:24:23.860
<v Speaker 10>here we are,</v>

2089
01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:25.390
<v Speaker 10>we're having this talk.</v>

2090
01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:29.440
<v Speaker 10>The university came out forthrightly in favor of free speech.</v>

2091
01:24:29.700 --> 01:24:30.670
<v Speaker 10>Hooray for that</v>

2092
01:24:30.750 --> 01:24:35.750
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2093
01:24:46.220 --> 01:24:50.630
<v Speaker 10>no one and so far all the questions today have been thoughtful and intelligent.</v>

2094
01:24:50.660 --> 01:24:52.340
<v Speaker 10>You seem like informed people.</v>

2095
01:24:52.580 --> 01:24:54.740
<v Speaker 10>It's like don't underestimate your strength.</v>

2096
01:24:55.250 --> 01:24:56.083
<v Speaker 10>And so,</v>

2097
01:24:56.090 --> 01:25:01.090
<v Speaker 10>and McMaster just published a set of guidelines governing this sort of behavior</v>

2098
01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:06.160
<v Speaker 10>so that will no longer be acceptable to disrupt perfectly reasonable proceedings</v>

2099
01:25:07.431 --> 01:25:08.930
<v Speaker 10>on university campuses.</v>

2100
01:25:11.050 --> 01:25:12.210
<v Speaker 10>And so that,</v>

2101
01:25:12.380 --> 01:25:15.320
<v Speaker 10>so the discussions like this can continue properly.</v>

2102
01:25:15.530 --> 01:25:20.530
<v Speaker 10>I mean there's definitely a place for give and take and for informed opposition,</v>

2103
01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:21.793
<v Speaker 10>let's say.</v>

2104
01:25:21.890 --> 01:25:26.450
<v Speaker 10>But there's a difference between informed opposition and child childish grand</v>

2105
01:25:26.451 --> 01:25:27.050
<v Speaker 10>standing.</v>

2106
01:25:27.050 --> 01:25:28.940
<v Speaker 10>And I think people know the difference between that.</v>

2107
01:25:28.941 --> 01:25:30.230
<v Speaker 10>So don't,</v>

2108
01:25:30.410 --> 01:25:33.470
<v Speaker 10>don't be desperate about it by not pick your battles.</v>

2109
01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:35.900
<v Speaker 10>A little courage goes a long way,</v>

2110
01:25:35.901 --> 01:25:36.171
<v Speaker 10>right?</v>

2111
01:25:36.171 --> 01:25:38.630
<v Speaker 10>Because other people see it and there's that,</v>

2112
01:25:38.631 --> 01:25:39.464
<v Speaker 10>there is,</v>

2113
01:25:40.130 --> 01:25:45.130
<v Speaker 10>I think a silent majority out there that is silent and is scared.</v>

2114
01:25:46.490 --> 01:25:50.180
<v Speaker 10>But if they see courage from somebody,</v>

2115
01:25:50.210 --> 01:25:51.630
<v Speaker 10>they responded to it.</v>

2116
01:25:51.710 --> 01:25:52.340
<v Speaker 10>Well,</v>

2117
01:25:52.340 --> 01:25:56.000
<v Speaker 10>I think you described lawyers in a way that appealed to me once.</v>

2118
01:25:56.240 --> 01:25:56.631
<v Speaker 10>He said,</v>

2119
01:25:56.631 --> 01:25:57.464
<v Speaker 10>I think,</v>

2120
01:25:57.590 --> 01:25:58.430
<v Speaker 10>I know that's rare,</v>

2121
01:25:58.431 --> 01:25:59.264
<v Speaker 10>but</v>

2122
01:26:00.590 --> 01:26:02.000
<v Speaker 10>you said lawyers,</v>

2123
01:26:02.030 --> 01:26:03.350
<v Speaker 10>I think these are the words you said.</v>

2124
01:26:03.351 --> 01:26:04.550
<v Speaker 10>Lawyers are</v>

2125
01:26:04.610 --> 01:26:07.400
<v Speaker 5>difficult and emotionally stable.</v>

2126
01:26:08.510 --> 01:26:10.580
<v Speaker 5>And it was the combination of those two things,</v>

2127
01:26:10.581 --> 01:26:12.050
<v Speaker 5>the willingness to be difficult,</v>

2128
01:26:12.410 --> 01:26:14.900
<v Speaker 5>but not to be emotional about it.</v>

2129
01:26:14.901 --> 01:26:15.261
<v Speaker 5>So don't,</v>

2130
01:26:15.261 --> 01:26:15.621
<v Speaker 5>don't,</v>

2131
01:26:15.621 --> 01:26:16.041
<v Speaker 5>don't,</v>

2132
01:26:16.041 --> 01:26:17.930
<v Speaker 5>where'd your emotions to the fight?</v>

2133
01:26:18.350 --> 01:26:19.370
<v Speaker 5>Take a step back,</v>

2134
01:26:19.580 --> 01:26:20.480
<v Speaker 5>engage in it,</v>

2135
01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:21.530
<v Speaker 5>see what you think.</v>

2136
01:26:21.710 --> 01:26:22.700
<v Speaker 5>Be Courageous,</v>

2137
01:26:22.730 --> 01:26:24.200
<v Speaker 5>but don't get wrapped up in it.</v>

2138
01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:25.730
<v Speaker 5>Don't be emotional about it,</v>

2139
01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:26.913
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

2140
01:26:27.430 --> 01:26:30.380
<v Speaker 5>retain your strength for the long haul.</v>

2141
01:26:30.410 --> 01:26:31.220
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

2142
01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:31.640
<v Speaker 10>Well,</v>

2143
01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:31.911
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

2144
01:26:31.911 --> 01:26:33.710
<v Speaker 10>one of the things I've learned strategically,</v>

2145
01:26:33.711 --> 01:26:35.420
<v Speaker 10>and this is really we're thinking about too,</v>

2146
01:26:35.421 --> 01:26:39.860
<v Speaker 10>is that when you're engaged in a public dispute like this,</v>

2147
01:26:39.950 --> 01:26:42.440
<v Speaker 10>it's not obvious when things are going your way.</v>

2148
01:26:43.580 --> 01:26:43.851
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>

2149
01:26:43.851 --> 01:26:44.241
<v Speaker 10>you think,</v>

2150
01:26:44.241 --> 01:26:44.511
<v Speaker 10>well,</v>

2151
01:26:44.511 --> 01:26:46.310
<v Speaker 10>this protest is not such a good thing.</v>

2152
01:26:46.311 --> 01:26:46.940
<v Speaker 10>It's like,</v>

2153
01:26:46.940 --> 01:26:48.590
<v Speaker 10>I wouldn't be so sure about that.</v>

2154
01:26:49.370 --> 01:26:53.600
<v Speaker 10>You know what's happened to me in the last 18 months is that virtually every</v>

2155
01:26:53.601 --> 01:26:57.440
<v Speaker 10>time that I been attacked and some of the attacks have been quite well,</v>

2156
01:26:57.441 --> 01:27:00.410
<v Speaker 10>I wouldn't say brutal because we haven't got to that thank God,</v>

2157
01:27:00.650 --> 01:27:02.090
<v Speaker 10>but they've certainly been,</v>

2158
01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:03.193
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>

2159
01:27:04.340 --> 01:27:05.660
<v Speaker 10>they've taken me aback.</v>

2160
01:27:05.690 --> 01:27:05.931
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>

2161
01:27:05.931 --> 01:27:06.764
<v Speaker 10>it's not,</v>

2162
01:27:07.010 --> 01:27:09.470
<v Speaker 10>it's not a straight forward thing to be in a hall with.</v>

2163
01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:14.360
<v Speaker 10>And this happened at McMaster with a hundred people yelling at you and Larry</v>

2164
01:27:14.361 --> 01:27:15.710
<v Speaker 10>near horns and all of that.</v>

2165
01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:21.040
<v Speaker 10>But that wasn't a bad thing as it turned out because it was filmed and it was</v>

2166
01:27:22.041 --> 01:27:26.630
<v Speaker 10>put on Youtube and it was terrible for the people who protested,</v>

2167
01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:27.590
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

2168
01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:28.730
<v Speaker 10>it wasn't good.</v>

2169
01:27:28.970 --> 01:27:31.790
<v Speaker 10>And so you got to detach yourself to,</v>

2170
01:27:31.820 --> 01:27:32.350
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

2171
01:27:32.350 --> 01:27:32.530
<v Speaker 10>if,</v>

2172
01:27:32.530 --> 01:27:34.730
<v Speaker 10>if you say what you think and you're careful about it,</v>

2173
01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.850
<v Speaker 10>it's going to have some short term effects and it's going to have some medium</v>

2174
01:27:37.851 --> 01:27:38.511
<v Speaker 10>term with exit.</v>

2175
01:27:38.511 --> 01:27:39.980
<v Speaker 10>It's going to have some long term effects.</v>

2176
01:27:39.981 --> 01:27:42.200
<v Speaker 10>And one of the things that you need to do,</v>

2177
01:27:42.201 --> 01:27:42.741
<v Speaker 10>I would say,</v>

2178
01:27:42.741 --> 01:27:44.090
<v Speaker 10>and this is an element of courage,</v>

2179
01:27:44.091 --> 01:27:49.091
<v Speaker 10>is you have to have faith that the medium to longterm consequences of you saying</v>

2180
01:27:50.121 --> 01:27:52.310
<v Speaker 10>what you have to say as clearly as possible.</v>

2181
01:27:52.340 --> 01:27:56.480
<v Speaker 10>It's going to be positive and you have to act on that supposition.</v>

2182
01:27:56.690 --> 01:27:57.381
<v Speaker 10>You don't know,</v>

2183
01:27:57.381 --> 01:27:57.770
<v Speaker 10>right?</v>

2184
01:27:57.770 --> 01:28:02.150
<v Speaker 10>You can't know that that's the existential leap of faith is you.</v>

2185
01:28:02.180 --> 01:28:02.901
<v Speaker 10>You can't know,</v>

2186
01:28:02.901 --> 01:28:04.190
<v Speaker 10>but you act anyway.</v>

2187
01:28:04.850 --> 01:28:08.330
<v Speaker 10>And my experience has been that you don't want to,</v>

2188
01:28:08.750 --> 01:28:11.810
<v Speaker 10>you don't want to make judgment too quickly because it's not always clear when</v>

2189
01:28:11.811 --> 01:28:12.950
<v Speaker 10>things are going your way.</v>

2190
01:28:13.790 --> 01:28:14.623
<v Speaker 10>So when you know,</v>

2191
01:28:14.750 --> 01:28:18.470
<v Speaker 10>you might stand up into class and say something that people react negatively to</v>

2192
01:28:18.471 --> 01:28:20.690
<v Speaker 10>eat and you might get pilloried for that by some people,</v>

2193
01:28:20.691 --> 01:28:24.530
<v Speaker 10>but you never know who you're touching in the crowd and you don't know how</v>

2194
01:28:24.531 --> 01:28:26.120
<v Speaker 10>that's going to unfold across time.</v>

2195
01:28:26.570 --> 01:28:29.780
<v Speaker 10>Now you who that might be a defining moment in someone else's life to watch you</v>

2196
01:28:29.781 --> 01:28:31.460
<v Speaker 10>stand up and say what you have to say.</v>

2197
01:28:32.180 --> 01:28:36.830
<v Speaker 10>So don't underestimate the power of truth and courage really.</v>

2198
01:28:37.410 --> 01:28:38.243
<v Speaker 10>So</v>

2199
01:28:38.790 --> 01:28:43.790
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2200
01:28:46.460 --> 01:28:47.240
<v Speaker 5>honestly,</v>

2201
01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:48.380
<v Speaker 5>they should be thankful.</v>

2202
01:28:48.381 --> 01:28:51.110
<v Speaker 5>And how civil and how peaceful you guys are.</v>

2203
01:28:51.140 --> 01:28:52.010
<v Speaker 5>They should be thankful.</v>

2204
01:28:52.011 --> 01:28:52.844
<v Speaker 5>They shouldn't be angry.</v>

2205
01:28:58.420 --> 01:29:02.070
<v Speaker 5>I regret to say we probably have time for probably</v>

2206
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:03.600
<v Speaker 10>just a couple more questions.</v>

2207
01:29:03.630 --> 01:29:04.650
<v Speaker 10>So let's</v>

2208
01:29:05.030 --> 01:29:05.930
<v Speaker 3>go to the back.</v>

2209
01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:09.073
<v Speaker 3>Hi.</v>

2210
01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:09.913
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2211
01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:13.130
<v Speaker 3>so my question is directed at Dr. Peterson.</v>

2212
01:29:13.460 --> 01:29:14.293
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2213
01:29:15.380 --> 01:29:19.820
<v Speaker 3>I've been watching your lectures online for a while and um,</v>

2214
01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:20.673
<v Speaker 3>you talk a lot,</v>

2215
01:29:21.150 --> 01:29:22.090
<v Speaker 3>come a little closer to the bank,</v>

2216
01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:25.430
<v Speaker 3>you speak a lot about that's better.</v>

2217
01:29:26.180 --> 01:29:30.710
<v Speaker 3>You speak a lot about character arc types and a narrative and the importance of</v>

2218
01:29:30.740 --> 01:29:34.760
<v Speaker 3>the young Ian idea of the</v>

2219
01:29:36.260 --> 01:29:37.460
<v Speaker 3>personal narrative.</v>

2220
01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:39.110
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2221
01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:40.753
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

2222
01:29:42.110 --> 01:29:44.570
<v Speaker 3>am having trouble formulating this into a question,</v>

2223
01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:49.370
<v Speaker 3>but I guess with the idea of art types in mind,</v>

2224
01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:49.880
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2225
01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:51.890
<v Speaker 3>are you familiar with,</v>

2226
01:29:51.910 --> 01:29:52.220
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2227
01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:55.640
<v Speaker 3>been neue Mandel broads idea of fractal patterns?</v>

2228
01:29:56.590 --> 01:29:57.290
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2229
01:29:57.290 --> 01:29:58.130
<v Speaker 3>and if so,</v>

2230
01:29:58.131 --> 01:29:59.420
<v Speaker 3>what do you think and if,</v>

2231
01:29:59.421 --> 01:30:01.430
<v Speaker 3>is there a connection there maybe to be found?</v>

2232
01:30:03.470 --> 01:30:03.621
<v Speaker 10>Well,</v>

2233
01:30:03.621 --> 01:30:08.621
<v Speaker 10>there seems to be a metaphorical connection in that the great is,</v>

2234
01:30:09.710 --> 01:30:11.930
<v Speaker 10>is reproduced in the small,</v>

2235
01:30:12.470 --> 01:30:15.080
<v Speaker 10>and that's certainly an idea that permeates,</v>

2236
01:30:15.470 --> 01:30:18.230
<v Speaker 10>let's say religious and theological speculation.</v>

2237
01:30:18.890 --> 01:30:19.131
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>

2238
01:30:19.131 --> 01:30:24.131
<v Speaker 10>there's an idea that here's an idea that it's like the idea of the genie,</v>

2239
01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:29.990
<v Speaker 10>which is the re same root word as genius,</v>

2240
01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:31.280
<v Speaker 10>the genius,</v>

2241
01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:35.390
<v Speaker 10>something of unimaginable power that's constrained in a very small space.</v>

2242
01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:37.760
<v Speaker 10>And that's kind of what a person is like.</v>

2243
01:30:38.780 --> 01:30:39.350
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>

2244
01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:41.390
<v Speaker 10>we have this affinity,</v>

2245
01:30:41.780 --> 01:30:43.790
<v Speaker 10>we have this connection to the infinite,</v>

2246
01:30:44.060 --> 01:30:45.980
<v Speaker 10>we have this connection to the divine,</v>

2247
01:30:46.490 --> 01:30:47.030
<v Speaker 10>but we're,</v>

2248
01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:49.530
<v Speaker 10>but it's constrained within within our frames,</v>

2249
01:30:49.580 --> 01:30:50.210
<v Speaker 10>right?</v>

2250
01:30:50.210 --> 01:30:55.210
<v Speaker 10>And we have to act out that the divine narrative in the confines of our own</v>

2251
01:30:55.581 --> 01:30:56.414
<v Speaker 10>life.</v>

2252
01:30:56.480 --> 01:30:58.430
<v Speaker 10>And so there is this overarching reality,</v>

2253
01:30:58.460 --> 01:31:03.460
<v Speaker 10>which is something like the fo the forthright confrontation with the catastrophe</v>

2254
01:31:04.191 --> 01:31:04.760
<v Speaker 10>of life,</v>

2255
01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:05.420
<v Speaker 10>right?</v>

2256
01:31:05.420 --> 01:31:05.780
<v Speaker 10>And,</v>

2257
01:31:05.780 --> 01:31:07.460
<v Speaker 10>but that has to be made personal,</v>

2258
01:31:07.490 --> 01:31:07.821
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

2259
01:31:07.821 --> 01:31:08.271
<v Speaker 10>so that,</v>

2260
01:31:08.271 --> 01:31:09.104
<v Speaker 10>that's one of yoga,</v>

2261
01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:09.801
<v Speaker 10>I would say,</v>

2262
01:31:09.801 --> 01:31:10.760
<v Speaker 10>deepest ideas,</v>

2263
01:31:10.761 --> 01:31:14.150
<v Speaker 10>is that the archetipal has to be made personally in your own life.</v>

2264
01:31:14.390 --> 01:31:18.020
<v Speaker 10>And so you take the generic pattern and you personalize it,</v>

2265
01:31:18.021 --> 01:31:20.450
<v Speaker 10>and then the infinite and the finite meat.</v>

2266
01:31:20.510 --> 01:31:22.130
<v Speaker 10>And that's the perfect combination.</v>

2267
01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:24.230
<v Speaker 10>And there's something about that that's,</v>

2268
01:31:24.770 --> 01:31:25.060
<v Speaker 10>well,</v>

2269
01:31:25.060 --> 01:31:27.260
<v Speaker 10>honorably profound I would say.</v>

2270
01:31:27.620 --> 01:31:27.900
<v Speaker 10>And,</v>

2271
01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:28.310
<v Speaker 10>and,</v>

2272
01:31:28.310 --> 01:31:30.980
<v Speaker 10>and as true as anything can be,</v>

2273
01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:36.080
<v Speaker 10>and I think people know this at the very deep level because you do know when</v>

2274
01:31:36.081 --> 01:31:39.200
<v Speaker 10>you're struggling to go to sleep at night and your conscience is bothering you</v>

2275
01:31:39.890 --> 01:31:41.840
<v Speaker 10>and you think through the things that you did in the day,</v>

2276
01:31:41.841 --> 01:31:42.291
<v Speaker 10>in the week,</v>

2277
01:31:42.291 --> 01:31:46.400
<v Speaker 10>you'll take solace in the things that you did that were noble and true and you,</v>

2278
01:31:46.401 --> 01:31:47.090
<v Speaker 10>and you can,</v>

2279
01:31:47.090 --> 01:31:51.740
<v Speaker 10>you can breathe a sigh of relief that you're not completely corrupt and lost and</v>

2280
01:31:51.741 --> 01:31:52.850
<v Speaker 10>then you can sleep.</v>

2281
01:31:53.510 --> 01:31:55.220
<v Speaker 10>It's like everyone knows this.</v>

2282
01:31:55.280 --> 01:31:55.521
<v Speaker 10>Well,</v>

2283
01:31:55.521 --> 01:31:57.080
<v Speaker 10>we need to know it consciously,</v>

2284
01:31:57.140 --> 01:31:57.710
<v Speaker 10>right?</v>

2285
01:31:57.710 --> 01:31:58.970
<v Speaker 10>And that's part of the process,</v>

2286
01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:01.420
<v Speaker 10>making the archetypal personal and that,</v>

2287
01:32:01.421 --> 01:32:04.450
<v Speaker 10>that's part of what the religious process is supposed to be about,</v>

2288
01:32:04.451 --> 01:32:06.130
<v Speaker 10>is to outline the,</v>

2289
01:32:06.330 --> 01:32:08.170
<v Speaker 10>the archetipal pattern and then to say,</v>

2290
01:32:08.171 --> 01:32:08.441
<v Speaker 10>look,</v>

2291
01:32:08.441 --> 01:32:09.730
<v Speaker 10>you have to meditate on this.</v>

2292
01:32:09.730 --> 01:32:13.660
<v Speaker 10>And you have to figure out how to make it true in the confines of your own life.</v>

2293
01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:15.360
<v Speaker 10>And that gives,</v>

2294
01:32:15.430 --> 01:32:19.360
<v Speaker 10>see the reason that works I think is because there's no doubt that your life is</v>

2295
01:32:19.361 --> 01:32:23.260
<v Speaker 10>tragic and there's no doubt that you have a bilevel and element and that you'll</v>

2296
01:32:23.261 --> 01:32:25.900
<v Speaker 10>be touched by betrayal and all those terrible things.</v>

2297
01:32:26.590 --> 01:32:30.400
<v Speaker 10>But there's a nobility about youtue and that nobility might be sufficient to</v>

2298
01:32:30.401 --> 01:32:32.260
<v Speaker 10>transcend your limitations.</v>

2299
01:32:32.710 --> 01:32:36.130
<v Speaker 10>And I would say that your life is a struggle to determine if that might be the</v>

2300
01:32:36.131 --> 01:32:36.820
<v Speaker 10>case.</v>

2301
01:32:36.820 --> 01:32:38.380
<v Speaker 10>And that's the act of faith.</v>

2302
01:32:38.930 --> 01:32:43.540
<v Speaker 10>And I also do believe I was asked today by South African journalist if I'm the</v>

2303
01:32:43.541 --> 01:32:46.210
<v Speaker 10>ultimate pessimist or the ultimate optimist,</v>

2304
01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:46.900
<v Speaker 10>no one.</v>

2305
01:32:46.900 --> 01:32:49.360
<v Speaker 10>I would say in some ways I am the ultimate pessimist.</v>

2306
01:32:49.361 --> 01:32:54.160
<v Speaker 10>I know I think as much as I can tolerate how terrible life can be,</v>

2307
01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:58.510
<v Speaker 10>but I do believe that the human spirit can overcome that catastrophe and can</v>

2308
01:32:58.511 --> 01:33:00.310
<v Speaker 10>rise out of it.</v>

2309
01:33:01.540 --> 01:33:06.540
<v Speaker 10>And I think the universities are that that idea expressed in stone and tradition</v>

2310
01:33:09.140 --> 01:33:10.330
<v Speaker 10>and it's a great idea.</v>

2311
01:33:10.331 --> 01:33:11.740
<v Speaker 10>Everyone needs the idea,</v>

2312
01:33:12.130 --> 01:33:13.450
<v Speaker 10>especially people who are young,</v>

2313
01:33:13.451 --> 01:33:14.380
<v Speaker 10>you know your life is,</v>

2314
01:33:14.530 --> 01:33:16.690
<v Speaker 10>you know that your life is going to be difficult.</v>

2315
01:33:17.050 --> 01:33:18.730
<v Speaker 10>It's like no one can say,</v>

2316
01:33:18.731 --> 01:33:18.941
<v Speaker 10>well,</v>

2317
01:33:18.941 --> 01:33:19.900
<v Speaker 10>it's going to be easy.</v>

2318
01:33:19.901 --> 01:33:20.621
<v Speaker 10>But you might say,</v>

2319
01:33:20.621 --> 01:33:20.801
<v Speaker 10>well,</v>

2320
01:33:20.801 --> 01:33:22.210
<v Speaker 10>do you want it to be easy?</v>

2321
01:33:22.910 --> 01:33:24.100
<v Speaker 10>What's in it for you?</v>

2322
01:33:24.101 --> 01:33:25.150
<v Speaker 10>If it's easy,</v>

2323
01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:25.901
<v Speaker 10>well,</v>

2324
01:33:25.901 --> 01:33:26.261
<v Speaker 10>no,</v>

2325
01:33:26.261 --> 01:33:30.280
<v Speaker 10>you want it to be difficult and worthwhile and you want to be the sort of person</v>

2326
01:33:30.281 --> 01:33:33.250
<v Speaker 10>that can manage that and that's what you should be.</v>

2327
01:33:33.460 --> 01:33:36.310
<v Speaker 10>That's what you should be encouraged to be at university.</v>

2328
01:33:36.740 --> 01:33:37.250
<v Speaker 10>And,</v>

2329
01:33:37.250 --> 01:33:39.820
<v Speaker 10>and that's what the universities are for.</v>

2330
01:33:40.210 --> 01:33:41.043
<v Speaker 10>So,</v>

2331
01:33:42.310 --> 01:33:44.160
<v Speaker 10>well that's the archetipal and the personal,</v>

2332
01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:45.033
<v Speaker 10>I would say.</v>

2333
01:33:45.100 --> 01:33:45.933
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

2334
01:33:45.940 --> 01:33:46.773
<v Speaker 10>Thank you very much.</v>

2335
01:33:47.190 --> 01:33:52.190
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2336
01:33:53.550 --> 01:33:53.981
<v Speaker 9>this will,</v>

2337
01:33:53.981 --> 01:33:54.290
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

2338
01:33:54.290 --> 01:33:55.650
<v Speaker 9>this will have to be our last question.</v>

2339
01:33:55.651 --> 01:33:55.921
<v Speaker 9>Go ahead,</v>

2340
01:33:55.921 --> 01:33:56.754
<v Speaker 9>sir.</v>

2341
01:33:56.910 --> 01:33:58.620
<v Speaker 9>In recent time,</v>

2342
01:33:58.950 --> 01:33:59.460
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

2343
01:33:59.460 --> 01:34:03.030
<v Speaker 9>I would probably identify the most recent us election is the turning point for</v>

2344
01:34:03.031 --> 01:34:03.864
<v Speaker 9>this.</v>

2345
01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:04.600
<v Speaker 9>And that's,</v>

2346
01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:06.120
<v Speaker 9>I've seen that as an American citizen,</v>

2347
01:34:06.121 --> 01:34:07.590
<v Speaker 9>this is my first time living in Canada.</v>

2348
01:34:07.650 --> 01:34:08.483
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>

2349
01:34:08.700 --> 01:34:13.680
<v Speaker 9>I've noticed that public discourse has taken to elevate fascism as the ultimate</v>

2350
01:34:13.681 --> 01:34:15.690
<v Speaker 9>evil and maybe rightfully so.</v>

2351
01:34:15.691 --> 01:34:15.901
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

2352
01:34:15.901 --> 01:34:19.980
<v Speaker 9>there were many horrific things commit by fascist states in the 20th century and</v>

2353
01:34:19.981 --> 01:34:20.671
<v Speaker 9>you see people,</v>

2354
01:34:20.671 --> 01:34:20.971
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

2355
01:34:20.971 --> 01:34:23.520
<v Speaker 9>like Facebook cover photos like bash the past,</v>

2356
01:34:23.521 --> 01:34:23.821
<v Speaker 9>you see,</v>

2357
01:34:23.821 --> 01:34:25.200
<v Speaker 9>you let stickers on laptops,</v>

2358
01:34:25.201 --> 01:34:26.850
<v Speaker 9>this machine kills fascists.</v>

2359
01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:27.631
<v Speaker 9>It is,</v>

2360
01:34:27.631 --> 01:34:27.841
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

2361
01:34:27.841 --> 01:34:31.770
<v Speaker 9>there's this big backlash against fascism and the horrors that it caused,</v>

2362
01:34:32.250 --> 01:34:33.510
<v Speaker 9>but in spite of that,</v>

2363
01:34:33.511 --> 01:34:38.511
<v Speaker 9>you don't see the same reaction to the horrors and the genocide that were caused</v>

2364
01:34:38.521 --> 01:34:41.850
<v Speaker 9>by socialist and Communist states in the 20th century.</v>

2365
01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:43.593
<v Speaker 1>Do not.</v>

2366
01:34:48.530 --> 01:34:53.530
<v Speaker 9>You see people who virtue signal endlessly about how horrible the Holocaust was,</v>

2367
01:34:54.111 --> 01:34:55.850
<v Speaker 9>about how awful these things were.</v>

2368
01:34:55.910 --> 01:34:58.100
<v Speaker 9>And then just hand away the famine,</v>

2369
01:34:58.101 --> 01:34:59.270
<v Speaker 9>genocide of the Ukraine,</v>

2370
01:34:59.300 --> 01:35:00.260
<v Speaker 9>the great leap forward.</v>

2371
01:35:00.261 --> 01:35:05.261
<v Speaker 9>They think these things are inconsequential or even necessary sacrifices for the</v>

2372
01:35:05.841 --> 01:35:08.720
<v Speaker 9>rise of the greater good of socialism or communism.</v>

2373
01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:13.730
<v Speaker 9>And I personally find that morally reprehensible and I can't understand where</v>

2374
01:35:13.731 --> 01:35:14.564
<v Speaker 9>that,</v>

2375
01:35:14.810 --> 01:35:15.710
<v Speaker 9>where that comes in,</v>

2376
01:35:15.711 --> 01:35:19.460
<v Speaker 9>how you can stand there and be so opposed to this genocide.</v>

2377
01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:22.880
<v Speaker 9>What say that this genocide is somehow just,</v>

2378
01:35:22.940 --> 01:35:23.121
<v Speaker 9>oh,</v>

2379
01:35:23.121 --> 01:35:24.080
<v Speaker 9>it's not a problem.</v>

2380
01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:25.640
<v Speaker 9>And why do you think that?</v>

2381
01:35:25.641 --> 01:35:27.500
<v Speaker 9>How do you think that disconnect happens?</v>

2382
01:35:27.501 --> 01:35:31.640
<v Speaker 9>How do you think people can convince themselves of that and why do you think</v>

2383
01:35:31.641 --> 01:35:32.480
<v Speaker 9>that happens?</v>

2384
01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:34.350
<v Speaker 10>It's a great question.</v>

2385
01:35:34.980 --> 01:35:35.813
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>

2386
01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:36.960
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

2387
01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:37.351
<v Speaker 10>I have,</v>

2388
01:35:37.351 --> 01:35:38.730
<v Speaker 10>my house is covered with,</v>

2389
01:35:39.150 --> 01:35:44.150
<v Speaker 10>with art from the Soviet era and I have a road of reasons for that.</v>

2390
01:35:44.610 --> 01:35:46.590
<v Speaker 10>Part of it is to remind me of what happened.</v>

2391
01:35:46.591 --> 01:35:50.400
<v Speaker 10>Part of it is to watch the struggle between the art and the propaganda on the</v>

2392
01:35:50.401 --> 01:35:52.020
<v Speaker 10>canvasses sort of in real time.</v>

2393
01:35:52.021 --> 01:35:52.261
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>

2394
01:35:52.261 --> 01:35:53.370
<v Speaker 10>I'm very interested in that,</v>

2395
01:35:53.940 --> 01:35:57.840
<v Speaker 10>but I would never decorate my house with Nazi Regalia,</v>

2396
01:35:58.380 --> 01:35:59.213
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

2397
01:35:59.390 --> 01:36:00.040
<v Speaker 10>and,</v>

2398
01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:00.691
<v Speaker 10>and you think,</v>

2399
01:36:00.691 --> 01:36:00.811
<v Speaker 10>well,</v>

2400
01:36:00.811 --> 01:36:01.980
<v Speaker 10>why is that exactly?</v>

2401
01:36:01.981 --> 01:36:02.491
<v Speaker 10>It's not like,</v>

2402
01:36:02.491 --> 01:36:05.640
<v Speaker 10>I don't know that that what happened in the communist regimes was utterly</v>

2403
01:36:05.641 --> 01:36:06.391
<v Speaker 10>reprehensible.</v>

2404
01:36:06.391 --> 01:36:06.930
<v Speaker 10>Why is it,</v>

2405
01:36:06.930 --> 01:36:08.850
<v Speaker 10>and perhaps it's not acceptable to have,</v>

2406
01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:09.211
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

2407
01:36:09.211 --> 01:36:11.220
<v Speaker 10>socialist realist paintings in your house,</v>

2408
01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:15.120
<v Speaker 10>but it's certainly more acceptable or it seems that way than to have paintings</v>

2409
01:36:15.240 --> 01:36:16.290
<v Speaker 10>from the Nazi era,</v>

2410
01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:17.153
<v Speaker 10>let's say.</v>

2411
01:36:17.370 --> 01:36:18.031
<v Speaker 10>So then you think,</v>

2412
01:36:18.031 --> 01:36:18.151
<v Speaker 10>well,</v>

2413
01:36:18.151 --> 01:36:19.380
<v Speaker 10>why is that exactly?</v>

2414
01:36:19.380 --> 01:36:20.213
<v Speaker 10>And I think,</v>

2415
01:36:21.540 --> 01:36:21.931
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

2416
01:36:21.931 --> 01:36:24.870
<v Speaker 10>back in 1918 at the door and the Russian revolution,</v>

2417
01:36:25.110 --> 01:36:28.770
<v Speaker 10>when Europe was inflamed and in ruins and the monarchical societies were</v>

2418
01:36:28.771 --> 01:36:32.550
<v Speaker 10>collapsing and the industrial revolution was in full force and there were</v>

2419
01:36:32.551 --> 01:36:33.060
<v Speaker 10>terrible,</v>

2420
01:36:33.060 --> 01:36:35.430
<v Speaker 10>there was terrible poverty and terrible inequality.</v>

2421
01:36:35.850 --> 01:36:39.480
<v Speaker 10>The dream of Universal Brotherhood was a compelling dream.</v>

2422
01:36:39.660 --> 01:36:41.440
<v Speaker 10>The dream of egalitarianism and,</v>

2423
01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:42.410
<v Speaker 10>and,</v>

2424
01:36:42.410 --> 01:36:42.960
<v Speaker 10>and,</v>

2425
01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:43.770
<v Speaker 10>and maybe,</v>

2426
01:36:43.770 --> 01:36:47.640
<v Speaker 10>maybe who knows how much of it was motivated by genuine benevolence.</v>

2427
01:36:48.090 --> 01:36:49.380
<v Speaker 10>Some Middle East.</v>

2428
01:36:49.710 --> 01:36:51.840
<v Speaker 10>It's very difficult to see that the Nazi,</v>

2429
01:36:52.410 --> 01:36:56.610
<v Speaker 10>the Nazi phenomenon was ever generated by any genuine benevolence.</v>

2430
01:36:56.640 --> 01:36:57.750
<v Speaker 10>That's very difficult to,</v>

2431
01:36:57.890 --> 01:36:58.860
<v Speaker 10>to make a case for.</v>

2432
01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:00.360
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>

2433
01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:01.970
<v Speaker 10>so maybe you can forgive the,</v>

2434
01:37:02.210 --> 01:37:03.170
<v Speaker 10>the socialists,</v>

2435
01:37:03.210 --> 01:37:06.480
<v Speaker 10>the communists utopians a hundred years ago because they didn't know what they</v>

2436
01:37:06.481 --> 01:37:07.314
<v Speaker 10>were getting in for.</v>

2437
01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:08.280
<v Speaker 10>People had warned them.</v>

2438
01:37:08.281 --> 01:37:10.090
<v Speaker 10>Dostoevsky warn the Nitro,</v>

2439
01:37:10.110 --> 01:37:10.550
<v Speaker 10>warn them.</v>

2440
01:37:10.550 --> 01:37:11.190
<v Speaker 10>But,</v>

2441
01:37:11.190 --> 01:37:12.023
<v Speaker 10>but still,</v>

2442
01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:14.850
<v Speaker 10>and then the other thing too is the problem of inequality.</v>

2443
01:37:15.420 --> 01:37:18.870
<v Speaker 10>It's like the problem of inequality is a real problem and it doesn't go away.</v>

2444
01:37:18.871 --> 01:37:21.780
<v Speaker 10>Like it's very difficult when you walk down Bluer Street for example,</v>

2445
01:37:21.781 --> 01:37:23.640
<v Speaker 10>in Toronto and you see homeless people,</v>

2446
01:37:23.641 --> 01:37:25.800
<v Speaker 10>alcoholics and drug addicts who are struggling.</v>

2447
01:37:25.801 --> 01:37:29.220
<v Speaker 10>And the mentally ill who are on the street and they're in their little domain of</v>

2448
01:37:29.221 --> 01:37:29.581
<v Speaker 10>hell.</v>

2449
01:37:29.581 --> 01:37:29.970
<v Speaker 10>It's,</v>

2450
01:37:29.970 --> 01:37:33.120
<v Speaker 10>it's really difficult for that to not tear at your heart strings and say,</v>

2451
01:37:33.121 --> 01:37:33.271
<v Speaker 10>well,</v>

2452
01:37:33.271 --> 01:37:35.790
<v Speaker 10>isn't the world and unjust place or an unfair place,</v>

2453
01:37:35.791 --> 01:37:36.361
<v Speaker 10>which it is.</v>

2454
01:37:36.361 --> 01:37:41.361
<v Speaker 10>And so you can see the never ending wellsprings of motivation to support the</v>

2455
01:37:42.301 --> 01:37:43.134
<v Speaker 10>oppressed.</v>

2456
01:37:43.410 --> 01:37:46.650
<v Speaker 10>And I think the fact that the Communists,</v>

2457
01:37:46.680 --> 01:37:48.480
<v Speaker 10>the communist dogma,</v>

2458
01:37:48.481 --> 01:37:53.481
<v Speaker 10>at least had that as part of its initiating ethos is partly what seems to make</v>

2459
01:37:53.941 --> 01:37:54.900
<v Speaker 10>it forgivable.</v>

2460
01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:55.980
<v Speaker 10>I also think it's</v>

2461
01:37:55.980 --> 01:38:00.000
<v Speaker 7>easier for people to identify why fascism is wrong.</v>

2462
01:38:00.510 --> 01:38:00.901
<v Speaker 7>We can say,</v>

2463
01:38:00.901 --> 01:38:01.530
<v Speaker 7>look,</v>

2464
01:38:01.530 --> 01:38:02.910
<v Speaker 7>racial superiority,</v>

2465
01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:04.300
<v Speaker 7>nope.</v>

2466
01:38:04.710 --> 01:38:04.981
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

2467
01:38:04.981 --> 01:38:05.820
<v Speaker 7>It's pretty simple,</v>

2468
01:38:05.821 --> 01:38:06.121
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2469
01:38:06.121 --> 01:38:07.050
<v Speaker 7>It's three words.</v>

2470
01:38:07.051 --> 01:38:08.070
<v Speaker 7>You can really get it,</v>

2471
01:38:08.490 --> 01:38:09.323
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2472
01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:13.313
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2473
01:38:13.380 --> 01:38:15.210
<v Speaker 1>but equality of outcome,</v>

2474
01:38:16.770 --> 01:38:18.330
<v Speaker 7>it's like that's really wrong.</v>

2475
01:38:18.540 --> 01:38:19.650
<v Speaker 7>It's really wrong.</v>

2476
01:38:19.830 --> 01:38:21.510
<v Speaker 7>But it's not so obvious why,</v>

2477
01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:22.111
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2478
01:38:22.111 --> 01:38:22.530
<v Speaker 7>It isn't,</v>

2479
01:38:22.530 --> 01:38:24.960
<v Speaker 7>you can't just say equality of outcome,</v>

2480
01:38:24.961 --> 01:38:28.830
<v Speaker 7>know and have everyone clap because it isn't as well.</v>

2481
01:38:28.890 --> 01:38:29.701
<v Speaker 7>And that's the thing.</v>

2482
01:38:29.701 --> 01:38:31.020
<v Speaker 7>It's really difficult to,</v>

2483
01:38:31.170 --> 01:38:36.170
<v Speaker 7>it's difficult to isolate the pathological elements in radical left wing thought</v>

2484
01:38:36.630 --> 01:38:38.970
<v Speaker 7>because they're not self evidently pathological.</v>

2485
01:38:38.971 --> 01:38:41.340
<v Speaker 7>Like there's this old cliche,</v>

2486
01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:42.150
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

2487
01:38:42.150 --> 01:38:42.661
<v Speaker 7>from each,</v>

2488
01:38:42.661 --> 01:38:45.300
<v Speaker 7>according to his ability to each according to his need.</v>

2489
01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:45.930
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

2490
01:38:45.930 --> 01:38:46.591
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

2491
01:38:46.591 --> 01:38:47.640
<v Speaker 7>that sounds pretty good.</v>

2492
01:38:47.641 --> 01:38:48.421
<v Speaker 7>We have needs.</v>

2493
01:38:48.421 --> 01:38:49.110
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

2494
01:38:49.110 --> 01:38:51.600
<v Speaker 7>let's have them fulfilled and well you have an ability,</v>

2495
01:38:51.601 --> 01:38:53.130
<v Speaker 7>well like manifested.</v>

2496
01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:54.270
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

2497
01:38:54.270 --> 01:38:58.710
<v Speaker 7>well it doesn't work in practice in in fact it's murderous in practice and it's</v>

2498
01:38:58.711 --> 01:39:01.860
<v Speaker 7>a great catastrophe in some sense that it's murderous in practice.</v>

2499
01:39:02.010 --> 01:39:03.990
<v Speaker 7>So I just think it's maybe part of it is,</v>

2500
01:39:03.991 --> 01:39:07.170
<v Speaker 7>is just a hell of a lot harder to learn why it's wrong.</v>

2501
01:39:07.410 --> 01:39:08.370
<v Speaker 7>That combined with,</v>

2502
01:39:08.371 --> 01:39:08.730
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2503
01:39:08.730 --> 01:39:13.680
<v Speaker 7>the genuine outpouring of compassion for the oppressed and [inaudible] which is</v>

2504
01:39:14.130 --> 01:39:15.630
<v Speaker 7>like who's for poverty?</v>

2505
01:39:16.290 --> 01:39:16.861
<v Speaker 7>No one.</v>

2506
01:39:16.861 --> 01:39:17.111
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

2507
01:39:17.111 --> 01:39:17.281
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>

2508
01:39:17.281 --> 01:39:19.650
<v Speaker 7>and inequality is a painful reality.</v>

2509
01:39:19.980 --> 01:39:21.240
<v Speaker 7>It's painful for everyone.</v>

2510
01:39:22.050 --> 01:39:22.260
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2511
01:39:22.260 --> 01:39:24.510
<v Speaker 7>even people who are self righteous about their,</v>

2512
01:39:24.540 --> 01:39:25.321
<v Speaker 7>their status,</v>

2513
01:39:25.321 --> 01:39:25.990
<v Speaker 7>let's say,</v>

2514
01:39:25.990 --> 01:39:26.190
<v Speaker 7>in,</v>

2515
01:39:26.190 --> 01:39:27.720
<v Speaker 7>in the depths of their soul.</v>

2516
01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:32.430
<v Speaker 7>The struggling of the fact of the struggling still rips at them.</v>

2517
01:39:33.690 --> 01:39:34.620
<v Speaker 7>And so</v>

2518
01:39:36.050 --> 01:39:38.120
<v Speaker 7>it's a more difficult lesson for us to learn.</v>

2519
01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:40.130
<v Speaker 7>So yeah.</v>

2520
01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:46.360
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2521
01:39:52.620 --> 01:39:54.120
<v Speaker 3>do those people lined up at the mics?</v>

2522
01:39:54.150 --> 01:39:56.070
<v Speaker 3>I sorry for leaving you hanging.</v>

2523
01:39:56.880 --> 01:39:59.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure we could go on all night if we had the time.</v>

2524
01:39:59.940 --> 01:40:00.540
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2525
01:40:00.540 --> 01:40:02.430
<v Speaker 3>but we must call this to a close.</v>

2526
01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.290
<v Speaker 3>I would like to</v>

2527
01:40:04.940 --> 01:40:05.773
<v Speaker 7>salute you</v>

2528
01:40:06.810 --> 01:40:11.810
<v Speaker 3>for your patients and your dedication in the face of the noise from outside.</v>

2529
01:40:12.961 --> 01:40:13.830
<v Speaker 3>Very nicely done.</v>

2530
01:40:14.070 --> 01:40:14.903
<v Speaker 3>Hold on.</v>

2531
01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:19.920
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2532
01:40:22.550 --> 01:40:23.121
<v Speaker 3>as you,</v>

2533

01:41:06.661 --> 01:41:10.760
<v Speaker 10>a voice in this country today and I would like to thank him very much for</v>

<v Speaker 10>Be Safe.</v>

2551
01:41:37.530 --> 01:41:38.070
<v Speaker 10>I just have,</v>

2552
01:41:38.070 --> 01:41:38.401
<v Speaker 10>sorry,</v>

2553
01:41:38.401 --> 01:41:39.900
<v Speaker 10>I just have one small thing to say.</v>

2554
01:41:40.020 --> 01:41:40.410
<v Speaker 10>Hold on.</v>

2555
01:41:40.410 --> 01:41:41.010
<v Speaker 10>I would,</v>

2556
01:41:41.010 --> 01:41:45.930
<v Speaker 10>I would very much like to stay and talk with a bunch of you and I generally do</v>

2557
01:41:45.931 --> 01:41:46.171
<v Speaker 10>that,</v>

2558
01:41:46.171 --> 01:41:50.220
<v Speaker 10>but I can't do it today because I have to go back to Toronto when I'm going to</v>

2559
01:41:50.221 --> 01:41:51.270
<v Speaker 10>Australia tomorrow.</v>

2560
01:41:51.271 --> 01:41:52.380
<v Speaker 10>So I don't,</v>

2561
01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:54.510
<v Speaker 10>I can't do that even though I would like to,</v>

2562
01:41:54.511 --> 01:41:58.630
<v Speaker 10>so I have to run off and then I have to drive back to Toronto and,</v>

2563
01:41:59.030 --> 01:42:00.420
<v Speaker 10>but despite that,</v>

2564
01:42:00.450 --> 01:42:03.720
<v Speaker 10>thank you very much for coming and for being patient and all of that.</v>

2565
01:42:04.150 --> 01:42:04.983
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

2566
01:43:10.230 --> 01:43:11.063
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2567
01:43:17.060 --> 01:43:17.893
<v Speaker 1>Why is</v>

2568
01:43:21.660 --> 01:43:22.493
<v Speaker 1>it</v>

2569
01:43:38.700 --> 01:43:39.533
<v Speaker 1>great</v>

2570
01:43:53.870 --> 01:43:55.610
<v Speaker 12>shame on Queens?</v>

2571
01:43:57.110 --> 01:43:58.910
<v Speaker 12>No freedom for hate speech.</v>

2572
01:43:59.580 --> 01:44:00.650
<v Speaker 12>He says he really,</v>

2573
01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:07.220
<v Speaker 6>really chosen where I'm at with him.</v>

2574
01:44:07.310 --> 01:44:09.650
<v Speaker 6>I've been looking at his voice that we're looking at the protest points.</v>

2575
01:44:09.670 --> 01:44:10.503
<v Speaker 6>I'm not really sure.</v>

2576
01:44:10.730 --> 01:44:11.300
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2577
01:44:11.300 --> 01:44:13.880
<v Speaker 6>I just think it's interesting that he's drawing the sort of crowd and that,</v>

2578
01:44:14.200 --> 01:44:14.420
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2579
01:44:14.420 --> 01:44:15.830
<v Speaker 6>what's happening here is happening.</v>

2580
01:44:15.831 --> 01:44:17.990
<v Speaker 6>I think that really says something about participation at Queens.</v>

2581
01:44:18.590 --> 01:44:21.200
<v Speaker 6>We're here to protest a Jordan Peterson Dean.</v>

2582
01:44:21.260 --> 01:44:23.230
<v Speaker 6>You give him the platform at Cuny University.</v>

2583
01:44:23.730 --> 01:44:24.320
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2584
01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:25.153
<v Speaker 6>Jordan Peterson,</v>

2585
01:44:25.190 --> 01:44:27.320
<v Speaker 6>aside from not knowing what he's talking about,</v>

2586
01:44:27.321 --> 01:44:28.040
<v Speaker 6>these are a lot,</v>

2587
01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:28.710
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2588
01:44:28.710 --> 01:44:29.770
<v Speaker 6>Pearson pension type.</v>

2589
01:44:31.430 --> 01:44:34.670
<v Speaker 6>It's not a discussion about which topics do you like on pizza.</v>

2590
01:44:34.940 --> 01:44:37.620
<v Speaker 6>It's a discussion about which people should be considered funeral,</v>

2591
01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:38.930
<v Speaker 6>which you lose your respect.</v>

2592
01:44:39.200 --> 01:44:41.060
<v Speaker 6>And that's not a debate that can happen anywhere.</v>

2593
01:44:47.990 --> 01:44:49.040
<v Speaker 1>I love that they are here.</v>

2594
01:44:49.041 --> 01:44:49.551
<v Speaker 1>How did this,</v>

2595
01:44:49.551 --> 01:44:50.384
<v Speaker 1>this course he does.</v>

2596
01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:52.760
<v Speaker 6>They don't agree with what he has to say so they're showing it.</v>

2597
01:44:53.090 --> 01:44:53.690
<v Speaker 6>But uh,</v>

2598
01:44:53.690 --> 01:44:57.560
<v Speaker 6>I have seen a lot of people call to cancel.</v>

2599
01:44:57.890 --> 01:45:01.340
<v Speaker 6>They are showing the Daniel Walsh should be ashamed of himself for allowing this</v>

2600
01:45:01.341 --> 01:45:01.791
<v Speaker 6>to happen.</v>

2601
01:45:01.791 --> 01:45:03.500
<v Speaker 6>And that I just think is wrong.</v>

2602
01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:07.010
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if it seems like we have a lot of very angry people in here because</v>

2603
01:45:07.011 --> 01:45:11.210
<v Speaker 6>someone's expressing an idea different than their own and here at a university,</v>

2604
01:45:11.211 --> 01:45:12.280
<v Speaker 6>I kind of thought that was.</v>

2605
01:45:21.940 --> 01:45:22.241
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

2606
01:45:22.241 --> 01:45:24.940
<v Speaker 1>Would you like one more Pepsi Cola?</v>

2607
01:45:25.050 --> 01:45:25.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>

2608
01:45:25.630 --> 01:45:26.370
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 1>eggs.</v>

2614
01:45:51.770 --> 01:45:53.210
<v Speaker 1>It takes bravery to say of that.</v>

2615
01:45:53.670 --> 01:45:54.770
<v Speaker 1>It was only stuff to what guys?</v>

2616
01:45:54.800 --> 01:45:55.633
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
