00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.650
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going pretty well.</v>

2
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.340
<v Speaker 1>It's quite a lot of fun to have a little baby round together.</v>

3
00:00:14.341 --> 00:00:15.174
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.920
<v Speaker 1>I think like most man,</v>

5
00:00:16.921 --> 00:00:21.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm somewhat nonplus let's say by infants.</v>

6
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:22.703
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

7
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.850
<v Speaker 1>it's easier for me to deal with kids after they're about,</v>

8
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.320
<v Speaker 1>once they get mobile.</v>

9
00:00:27.321 --> 00:00:31.110
<v Speaker 1>I once I can sort of throw them around a bit more than I know what to do with</v>

10
00:00:31.111 --> 00:00:32.400
<v Speaker 1>them once I can play with them.</v>

11
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:33.503
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

12
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.463
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

13
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.600
<v Speaker 1>it's really fun to watch my daughter be a mother.</v>

14
00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:41.601
<v Speaker 1>She's really good at it and it's good to have another young thing in the family</v>

15
00:00:42.571 --> 00:00:43.830
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

16
00:00:43.831 --> 00:00:45.000
<v Speaker 1>cause babies are very,</v>

17
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.380
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of like fire you,</v>

18
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.120
<v Speaker 1>you can't help but watch them and</v>

19
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:50.813
<v Speaker 1>it's great.</v>

20
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.073
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>

21
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.240
<v Speaker 1>And she seems healthy and um,</v>

22
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.521
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

23
00:00:56.521 --> 00:00:57.720
<v Speaker 1>She's cute as can be.</v>

24
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.000
<v Speaker 1>Of course babies are sneaky that way,</v>

25
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.290
<v Speaker 1>but it's working.</v>

26
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.921
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

27
00:01:01.921 --> 00:01:03.330
<v Speaker 1>I think it's really going well.</v>
