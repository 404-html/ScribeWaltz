1
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.710
<v Speaker 1>It is gradually become clear to me what</v>
<v Speaker 1>every Greek philosophy up until now has</v>

2
00:00:10.121 --> 00:00:15.121
<v Speaker 1>consisted of namely the concession of</v>
<v Speaker 1>its originator and the species of</v>

3
00:00:16.151 --> 00:00:19.210
<v Speaker 1>involuntary and unconscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>autobiography.</v>

4
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.650
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's deceptive.</v>

5
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.030
<v Speaker 1>That's the deceptively simple sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though it's not a particularly</v>

6
00:00:28.031 --> 00:00:31.460
<v Speaker 1>simple sentence because it stands on its</v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

7
00:00:31.461 --> 00:00:35.410
<v Speaker 1>What people generally assume about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>process of thinking.</v>

8
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.630
<v Speaker 1>You generally think that when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>

9
00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:41.750
<v Speaker 1>you're thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I mentioned before,</v>

10
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.260
<v Speaker 1>the structure of the objective world</v>
<v Speaker 1>need is making an entirely different</v>

11
00:00:46.261 --> 00:00:51.261
<v Speaker 1>point here and what he's fundamentally</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing is treating the philosopher not as</v>

12
00:00:52.141 --> 00:00:54.360
<v Speaker 1>a rational being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as a living being,</v>

13
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.770
<v Speaker 1>and there's a big difference between</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a rational being and being a</v>

14
00:00:58.771 --> 00:01:01.230
<v Speaker 1>living being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're living being your</v>

15
00:01:01.231 --> 00:01:04.620
<v Speaker 1>primary goal is to do whatever it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that furthers your life and if you're a</v>

16
00:01:04.621 --> 00:01:07.200
<v Speaker 1>rational being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then your primary goal is to do whatever</v>

17
00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:09.900
<v Speaker 1>it is that a rational being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike Do,</v>

18
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.760
<v Speaker 1>and you could say that a living being</v>
<v Speaker 1>should first and foremost be a rational</v>

19
00:01:14.761 --> 00:01:19.140
<v Speaker 1>being and in some sense that's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>message of the of the Western</v>

20
00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:22.440
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's by no means self evident that</v>

21
00:01:22.441 --> 00:01:25.510
<v Speaker 1>that's the case and it's certainly not</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that Nietzsche Nietzsche,</v>

22
00:01:25.511 --> 00:01:27.720
<v Speaker 1>who doesn't believe that people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>rational beings,</v>

23
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.840
<v Speaker 1>certainly not primarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and more importantly,</v>

24
00:01:30.841 --> 00:01:33.810
<v Speaker 1>he isn't exactly convinced that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be so.</v>

25
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.550
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of niches,</v>

26
00:01:35.551 --> 00:01:40.551
<v Speaker 1>most famous maximums is that truth</v>
<v Speaker 1>serves life and that's a very difficult</v>

27
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.130
<v Speaker 1>different idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the purpose of truth ses,</v>

28
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.550
<v Speaker 1>the accurate representation of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>objective world.</v>

29
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.790
<v Speaker 1>Those aren't the same thing at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you could ask,</v>

30
00:01:50.791 --> 00:01:52.470
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does it mean for truth to serve</v>

31
00:01:52.471 --> 00:01:55.050
<v Speaker 1>life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you construe truth that way,</v>

32
00:01:55.051 --> 00:01:58.950
<v Speaker 1>what would truly look like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know the mere statement that</v>

33
00:01:58.951 --> 00:02:03.270
<v Speaker 1>truths should serve life doesn't offer</v>
<v Speaker 1>you the answers to those questions,</v>

34
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.373
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

35
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.470
<v Speaker 1>what did?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the beginning of a different</v>

36
00:02:08.471 --> 00:02:11.770
<v Speaker 1>metaphysics and in some sense of</v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphysics,</v>

37
00:02:11.771 --> 00:02:16.771
<v Speaker 1>which is say the universe within which a</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosopher might operate a metaphysics</v>

38
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.230
<v Speaker 1>is the initial structure of</v>
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions within which a view of</v>

39
00:02:23.831 --> 00:02:28.831
<v Speaker 1>the world is organized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One presupposition might be human beings</v>

40
00:02:30.781 --> 00:02:35.781
<v Speaker 1>are rational and that we're attempting</v>
<v Speaker 1>to formulate and improve our sense of</v>

41
00:02:36.581 --> 00:02:39.100
<v Speaker 1>the objective world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our formulation for the objective world,</v>

42
00:02:39.101 --> 00:02:43.540
<v Speaker 1>and another would be that you would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't rational or irrational and that</v>

43
00:02:43.541 --> 00:02:45.820
<v Speaker 1>we're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we're motivated to do is to live</v>

44
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.690
<v Speaker 1>whatever that means and that the purpose</v>
<v Speaker 1>of our thinking and our philosophy</v>

45
00:02:49.691 --> 00:02:53.550
<v Speaker 1>should be to facilitate our living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's niches.</v>

46
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.620
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the foundation</v>
<v Speaker 1>blocks of philosophy.</v>

47
00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.810
<v Speaker 1>So He's a moral philosopher</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally because morality is about</v>

48
00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:08.410
<v Speaker 1>values and the values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Essentially values are</v>

49
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.970
<v Speaker 1>you could say values are what you aim</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

50
00:03:11.971 --> 00:03:16.050
<v Speaker 1>but it's more complicated than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Values actually constitute the lens</v>

51
00:03:16.051 --> 00:03:19.440
<v Speaker 1>through which you view the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's partly what you're aiming at,</v>

52
00:03:19.441 --> 00:03:23.280
<v Speaker 1>but it's also partly your conception of</v>
<v Speaker 1>who you are now and where you are.</v>

53
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:28.170
<v Speaker 1>And it's also partly your conception of</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you're going to get to where it is</v>

54
00:03:28.171 --> 00:03:33.171
<v Speaker 1>that you want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also partly the psychological</v>

55
00:03:33.901 --> 00:03:38.220
<v Speaker 1>system that you use to parse up the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world so that it reveals to you the</v>

56
00:03:38.221 --> 00:03:40.670
<v Speaker 1>pathway that you could take to get to</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you want,</v>

57
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.180
<v Speaker 1>values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that,</v>

58
00:03:42.181 --> 00:03:45.570
<v Speaker 1>and then it's more than that because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could say that you have added value</v>

59
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.660
<v Speaker 1>which contains all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you can say that you have a set</v>

60
00:03:49.661 --> 00:03:52.000
<v Speaker 1>of values which is the arrangement of</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that out,</v>

61
00:03:52.001 --> 00:03:55.020
<v Speaker 1>and then you could say that you have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>set of values that's the range,</v>

62
00:03:55.021 --> 00:03:57.580
<v Speaker 1>but of all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have to arrange with other</v>

63
00:03:57.581 --> 00:04:02.080
<v Speaker 1>people and then you could say that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have all that and you have to arrange it</v>

64
00:04:02.081 --> 00:04:05.110
<v Speaker 1>with other people and you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrange it across different spans of</v>

65
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.590
<v Speaker 1>time because what you want today and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you want next week and what you</v>

66
00:04:08.591 --> 00:04:12.820
<v Speaker 1>want next month are not necessarily the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing and one does not necessarily</v>

67
00:04:12.821 --> 00:04:16.090
<v Speaker 1>lead into the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to be a moral philosopher is to</v>

68
00:04:16.091 --> 00:04:20.920
<v Speaker 1>examine how that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that system is and how it operates</v>

69
00:04:20.921 --> 00:04:22.240
<v Speaker 1>and how it came about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

70
00:04:22.241 --> 00:04:26.170
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that need to says is</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has gradually become clear to me what</v>

71
00:04:26.171 --> 00:04:30.190
<v Speaker 1>every Greek philosophy up until now is</v>
<v Speaker 1>consisted of namely the confession of</v>

72
00:04:30.191 --> 00:04:33.610
<v Speaker 1>its originator and the species of</v>
<v Speaker 1>involuntary and unconscious</v>

73
00:04:33.611 --> 00:04:36.880
<v Speaker 1>autobiography.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So his claim fundamentally is that no</v>

74
00:04:36.881 --> 00:04:40.150
<v Speaker 1>matter what the philosopher thinks he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing well,</v>

75
00:04:40.151 --> 00:04:44.890
<v Speaker 1>he's reading philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he's actually doing is revealing</v>

76
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.290
<v Speaker 1>and articulating his being,</v>

77
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:49.830
<v Speaker 1>and then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

78
00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:53.460
<v Speaker 1>where did that come from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is,</v>

79
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.010
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly it's you could consider it a</v>

80
00:04:56.011 --> 00:04:59.420
<v Speaker 1>biological function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In so far as that we have value</v>

81
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.920
<v Speaker 1>structures that are built into us that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are the process.</v>

82
00:05:01.921 --> 00:05:04.950
<v Speaker 1>We would say the process of a very long</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary history,</v>

83
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.340
<v Speaker 1>but because you're also a cultural</v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomena and because the manner in</v>

84
00:05:10.351 --> 00:05:14.850
<v Speaker 1>which you've arranged your values and</v>
<v Speaker 1>your desires has been conditioned to the</v>

85
00:05:14.851 --> 00:05:19.851
<v Speaker 1>last degree by the process of</v>
<v Speaker 1>enculturation that you were subjected to</v>

86
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:21.323
<v Speaker 1>when you</v>

87
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.390
<v Speaker 1>confessed and an autobiographical manner</v>
<v Speaker 1>and articulate that what you're also</v>

88
00:05:28.391 --> 00:05:33.391
<v Speaker 1>doing is really capitulating the entire</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of your culture.</v>

89
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.140
<v Speaker 1>It's in you and you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

90
00:05:35.141 --> 00:05:38.080
<v Speaker 1>where is it in you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In that and what does it you mean,</v>

91
00:05:38.081 --> 00:05:43.081
<v Speaker 1>part of it means is that you act out a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern of behavior and that pattern of</v>

92
00:05:43.361 --> 00:05:48.361
<v Speaker 1>behavior is like a dance that someone is</v>
<v Speaker 1>manifesting to a symphonic score.</v>

93
00:05:48.641 --> 00:05:53.641
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievably complicated and it has</v>
<v Speaker 1>its psychological elements and some of</v>

94
00:05:54.161 --> 00:05:55.810
<v Speaker 1>those are conscious and some of them</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't.</v>

95
00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.910
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are just implicit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>embedded in the way you act and the way</v>

96
00:05:58.911 --> 00:06:03.290
<v Speaker 1>you perceive and what the philosopher is</v>
<v Speaker 1>attempting to do is to reveal those to</v>

97
00:06:03.291 --> 00:06:08.120
<v Speaker 1>himself and to articulate them so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire structure can be analyzed</v>

98
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:09.710
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So niches.</v>

99
00:06:09.711 --> 00:06:14.630
<v Speaker 1>First proposition is that when a</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosopher is thinking that what he's</v>

100
00:06:14.631 --> 00:06:17.840
<v Speaker 1>doing is not thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's revealing himself and an</v>

101
00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:21.650
<v Speaker 1>autobiographical sense under the guise</v>
<v Speaker 1>of rational thinking and so then it</v>

102
00:06:21.651 --> 00:06:26.651
<v Speaker 1>becomes something more like a story and</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

103
00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:30.290
<v Speaker 1>any covers all that in the first two</v>
<v Speaker 1>phrases.</v>

104
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.520
<v Speaker 1>So that gives you some example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some indication of what this book is</v>

105
00:06:34.521 --> 00:06:34.940
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
