00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.650
<v Speaker 1>What happens in the shop manic</v>

2
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.150
<v Speaker 1>experiences that Scherman has the experience of being reduced to a skeleton</v>

3
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.493
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>

4
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.150
<v Speaker 1>So death,</v>

5
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.030
<v Speaker 1>a death experience on very realistic death experience.</v>

6
00:00:24.031 --> 00:00:28.990
<v Speaker 1>And then the next thing that happens is that he finds himself in a place where</v>

7
00:00:28.991 --> 00:00:30.810
<v Speaker 1>he's communing with his ancestor,</v>

8
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.320
<v Speaker 1>the ancestral spirits.</v>

9
00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.690
<v Speaker 1>And then after that there's the climbing of something like the ladder,</v>

10
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:38.980
<v Speaker 1>Jacob's ladder say,</v>

11
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.480
<v Speaker 1>and an encounter with God for all intents and purposes.</v>

12
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.003
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

13
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:46.900
<v Speaker 1>it's very widespread,</v>

14
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.873
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

15
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:49.383
<v Speaker 1>phenomena.</v>

16
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.670
<v Speaker 1>It's the world tree.</v>

17
00:00:51.671 --> 00:00:52.071
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

18
00:00:52.071 --> 00:00:53.140
<v Speaker 1>I've thought about this a lot,</v>

19
00:00:53.141 --> 00:00:54.160
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out what this,</v>

20
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:55.703
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

21
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:56.720
<v Speaker 1>What this represents.</v>

22
00:00:56.721 --> 00:00:58.290
<v Speaker 1>According to a Yakut informant,</v>

23
00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.380
<v Speaker 1>that that's in Siberia,</v>

24
00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.080
<v Speaker 1>the spirits carry the future showmen to hell and shut them in a house for three</v>

25
00:01:03.081 --> 00:01:03.750
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

26
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.450
<v Speaker 1>Here he undergoes is initiation.</v>

27
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.890
<v Speaker 1>The spirits cut off his head,</v>

28
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.270
<v Speaker 1>which they set off to one side for the novice must watch his own dismemberment</v>

29
00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:12.140
<v Speaker 1>with his own eyes,</v>

30
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.350
<v Speaker 1>dissolution to the primary elements in some sense,</v>

31
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.740
<v Speaker 1>and hack his body to bits which are later distributed among the spirits of</v>

32
00:01:18.741 --> 00:01:19.760
<v Speaker 1>various sicknesses.</v>

33
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.910
<v Speaker 1>It's only on this condition that the future Sharman will obtain.</v>

34
00:01:22.911 --> 00:01:26.120
<v Speaker 1>The power of healing is bones then covered with new flash in his,</v>

35
00:01:26.121 --> 00:01:28.340
<v Speaker 1>some Casey has also given new blood,</v>

36
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.570
<v Speaker 1>so visit death and resurrection experience that's associated with this show.</v>

37
00:01:31.571 --> 00:01:32.404
<v Speaker 1>Monique ritual.</v>

38
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.330
<v Speaker 1>We're here in the presence of a very ancient religious idea which belongs to the</v>

39
00:01:40.331 --> 00:01:41.230
<v Speaker 1>hunter culture.</v>

40
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.140
<v Speaker 1>Bone symbolizes the final route of animal life.</v>

41
00:01:44.141 --> 00:01:46.810
<v Speaker 1>The mold from which the flesh continually raw rises.</v>

42
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.110
<v Speaker 1>It is from the bone that men and animals are reborn for a time.</v>

43
00:01:50.111 --> 00:01:52.570
<v Speaker 1>They maintain themselves in an existence of the flesh.</v>

44
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.960
<v Speaker 1>Then they die and their life is reduced to the essence concentrated in the</v>

45
00:01:55.961 --> 00:01:58.150
<v Speaker 1>skeleton from which they will be born again.</v>

46
00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.290
<v Speaker 1>That's a good graphic representation of the experience.</v>
