1
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.140
<v Speaker 1>What's the proper level of analysis because as I mentioned this to begin with,</v>

2
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.250
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to</v>

3
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.150
<v Speaker 1>formulate the question.</v>

4
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.590
<v Speaker 1>The original question is what led to the issue.</v>

5
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.480
<v Speaker 1>I would say their request to the question of human motivation for evil except</v>

6
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.270
<v Speaker 1>perhaps the opposite question,</v>

7
00:00:44.271 --> 00:00:45.890
<v Speaker 1>which is human motivation for good,</v>

8
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.020
<v Speaker 1>you will also historically positive it's opposite or the dark because of light</v>

9
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.490
<v Speaker 1>or the evil you are of the opposite of that.</v>

10
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.610
<v Speaker 1>There's no way around them.</v>

11
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.180
<v Speaker 1>So it's the same question and that would be the question I suppose suppose of</v>

12
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.600
<v Speaker 1>ethical behavior morale or something like that and the question,</v>

13
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.190
<v Speaker 1>the question of its nature,</v>

14
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.380
<v Speaker 1>the nature of reality in the world.</v>

15
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.540
<v Speaker 1>It's a deep question.</v>

16
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.180
<v Speaker 1>You'd say deepest,</v>

17
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.640
<v Speaker 1>deepest question and it requires formulation at the deepest possible level of</v>

18
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.650
<v Speaker 1>analysis and it's a mystery that requires formulation at the deepest possible</v>

19
00:01:24.021 --> 00:01:25.070
<v Speaker 1>level of analysis.</v>

20
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.080
<v Speaker 1>And so you accepted to history and you accepted.</v>

21
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.610
<v Speaker 1>It's the deepest level analysis and yourself,</v>

22
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.040
<v Speaker 1>where do you go find an actual to request it that's mysterious at the deepest</v>

23
00:01:38.121 --> 00:01:42.140
<v Speaker 1>possible level of analysis and answer that at least the part as you go or you</v>

24
00:01:42.141 --> 00:01:45.200
<v Speaker 1>don't go where you don't know.</v>

25
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.540
<v Speaker 1>You go to that place that you don't know.</v>

26
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.820
<v Speaker 1>There's actually a technical,</v>

27
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.440
<v Speaker 1>it's a technical issue.</v>

28
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.780
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that current,</v>

29
00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.790
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is well supported by the relevant neuropsychological and</v>

30
00:02:02.121 --> 00:02:03.530
<v Speaker 1>neuropsychiatric literature,</v>

31
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.700
<v Speaker 1>is that your dreams and your fantasies containing information that you don't yet</v>

32
00:02:12.441 --> 00:02:13.274
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

33
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.570
<v Speaker 1>Now that's not an easy thing to understand because you might take,</v>

34
00:02:17.571 --> 00:02:21.560
<v Speaker 1>let's say you have a dream and you figure out what the dream means.</v>

35
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:22.910
<v Speaker 1>There's a mystery,</v>

36
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:23.773
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

37
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.531
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

38
00:02:24.531 --> 00:02:25.610
<v Speaker 1>if you didn't know what the three,</v>

39
00:02:25.611 --> 00:02:27.490
<v Speaker 1>then how the hell did you dream,</v>

40
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

41
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean because you drive,</v>

42
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.970
<v Speaker 1>you don't understand it.</v>

43
00:02:31.971 --> 00:02:33.080
<v Speaker 1>So how does that work?</v>

44
00:02:33.081 --> 00:02:35.420
<v Speaker 1>Because how can you think of something that you don't understand?</v>

45
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.170
<v Speaker 1>Part of the answers that you're not exactly a unity.</v>

46
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.230
<v Speaker 1>There's parts of you that know things that other parts of you don't know.</v>

47
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.590
<v Speaker 1>And there's parts of you that know things in ways that the part of you that</v>

48
00:02:45.591 --> 00:02:49.970
<v Speaker 1>talks can't understand and there's things that you act out that are too</v>

49
00:02:49.971 --> 00:02:52.610
<v Speaker 1>complicated for you to represent her to articulate.</v>

50
00:02:52.611 --> 00:02:55.910
<v Speaker 1>And so there's lots of things about you that were,</v>

51
00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.990
<v Speaker 1>that you don't understand that or lesson foreman,</v>

52
00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.790
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

53
00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.030
<v Speaker 1>You don't know how you breathe,</v>

54
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.620
<v Speaker 1>you don't know your heart works,</v>

55
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.100
<v Speaker 1>how your heart and so you don't have voluntary control over that.</v>

56
00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:08.230
<v Speaker 1>So it's not surprising in some sense that you're,</v>

57
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.000
<v Speaker 1>your mind could produce contents that transcends your articulate.</v>

58
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.460
<v Speaker 1>No UMES idea was that,</v>

59
00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:17.020
<v Speaker 1>that's what dreams did.</v>

60
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.100
<v Speaker 1>What dreams were doing essentially was you a world view.</v>

61
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.170
<v Speaker 1>And that world is only partial obviously,</v>

62
00:03:24.171 --> 00:03:24.860
<v Speaker 1>because what the hell,</v>

63
00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:25.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

64
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:26.403
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

65
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.641
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

66
00:03:26.641 --> 00:03:29.500
<v Speaker 1>you're limited in your knowledge and you're articulate and your,</v>

67
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.830
<v Speaker 1>and your logical it an integrated,</v>

68
00:03:32.831 --> 00:03:33.820
<v Speaker 1>articulate knowledges,</v>

69
00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.260
<v Speaker 1>limited domain,</v>

70
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.250
<v Speaker 1>and there's lots of things that exist outside that made it goes,</v>

71
00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:39.551
<v Speaker 1>it takes,</v>

72
00:03:39.551 --> 00:03:41.770
<v Speaker 1>you don't understand or errors that you've made.</v>

73
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.170
<v Speaker 1>And you also have to cope with them.</v>

74
00:03:44.171 --> 00:03:47.350
<v Speaker 1>You have to start provisionally understanding them because not only do you have</v>

75
00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:49.480
<v Speaker 1>to understand what you understand,</v>

76
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.900
<v Speaker 1>you have to come to understand what you don't yet understand.</v>

77
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.741
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

78
00:03:53.741 --> 00:03:55.790
<v Speaker 1>And that's how you learn and it's August.</v>

79
00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.810
<v Speaker 1>How that happens at UMES idea was that this is an elaboration is I think to some</v>

80
00:04:00.851 --> 00:04:05.830
<v Speaker 1>degree while you learn in part by acting and then you in part by representing</v>

81
00:04:05.831 --> 00:04:09.380
<v Speaker 1>that APP and you learn by analyzing this representation.</v>

82
00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.290
<v Speaker 1>And I would say yoga is not particular,</v>

83
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.650
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

84
00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:13.380
<v Speaker 1>regardless,</v>

85
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:14.410
<v Speaker 1>in most cases,</v>

86
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:15.370
<v Speaker 1>by modern,</v>

87
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.060
<v Speaker 1>more biologically oriented psychologists and medical practitioners.</v>

88
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.090
<v Speaker 1>But that's generally because they don't understand what the hell he was talking</v>

89
00:04:22.091 --> 00:04:22.870
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

90
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.670
<v Speaker 1>So the reason is there's good no psychiatric evidence,</v>

91
00:04:27.671 --> 00:04:31.000
<v Speaker 1>neuropsychological epis that that's actually how the brain functions.</v>

92
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.030
<v Speaker 1>So there is a neuropsychologist and Goldberg who was a student,</v>

93
00:04:36.031 --> 00:04:39.810
<v Speaker 1>he took another girl would call it just made Alexander Luria is a Russian,</v>

94
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.820
<v Speaker 1>probably the greatest school psychologist of the 20th century.</v>

95
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.130
<v Speaker 1>He basically laid the groundwork,</v>

96
00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.650
<v Speaker 1>the modern understanding of the way the brain functions in his students</v>

97
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:56.010
<v Speaker 1>discovered extraordinarily fundamental neurophysiological facts.</v>

98
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.820
<v Speaker 1>Brady's and heavy hitter.</v>

99
00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.020
<v Speaker 1>I guess student Kokona Goldberg was very interested in why we have two</v>

100
00:05:02.021 --> 00:05:02.854
<v Speaker 1>hemispheres.</v>

101
00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:04.213
<v Speaker 1>It's not wrong.</v>

102
00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.250
<v Speaker 1>We have two brains and there is evidence.</v>

103
00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.160
<v Speaker 1>There was surgery that was government,</v>

104
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.610
<v Speaker 1>not so much anymore but years ago when people had intractable epilepsy.</v>

105
00:05:15.611 --> 00:05:18.010
<v Speaker 1>That cost to cut two hemispheres,</v>

106
00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:20.310
<v Speaker 1>Corpus Callosum,</v>

107
00:05:20.311 --> 00:05:21.770
<v Speaker 1>which is the fat tissue that</v>

108
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.960
<v Speaker 1>copper hemispheres and collective</v>

109
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:30.863
<v Speaker 1>consciousness</v>

110
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.980
<v Speaker 1>in you in your feet,</v>

111
00:05:34.981 --> 00:05:39.210
<v Speaker 1>you have to consciousness is somewhat separate that you communicate,</v>

112
00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.780
<v Speaker 1>but at each house had various functions and what that implies is if you need to</v>

113
00:05:43.781 --> 00:05:48.781
<v Speaker 1>look at the world in two ways and that implies maybe that the world is some</v>

114
00:05:49.241 --> 00:05:53.940
<v Speaker 1>sense fundamentally divisible into two because otherwise why would you involve</v>

115
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:54.410
<v Speaker 1>the brain?</v>

116
00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.200
<v Speaker 1>Then we'd look at it in two ways.</v>

117
00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.190
<v Speaker 1>Since you evolve to active live hitting the world and it's not just you because</v>

118
00:06:01.191 --> 00:06:03.410
<v Speaker 1>animals have two hemispheres as well.</v>

119
00:06:03.411 --> 00:06:08.411
<v Speaker 1>It's very fun and what Goldberg suggested was that your left hemisphere was</v>

120
00:06:10.811 --> 00:06:15.811
<v Speaker 1>specialized for operation in places that you understand your right hemisphere</v>

121
00:06:16.341 --> 00:06:20.540
<v Speaker 1>was specialized for operation and places that you don't understand.</v>

122
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.400
<v Speaker 1>I need to think about that.</v>

123
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.950
<v Speaker 1>If you want to think about it from a more biological perspective,</v>

124
00:06:24.951 --> 00:06:27.530
<v Speaker 1>you could say that you have one system,</v>

125
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:32.270
<v Speaker 1>say psychological system that orients you explored territory,</v>

126
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:36.830
<v Speaker 1>which is where we're things are familiar and where you can predict what's going</v>

127
00:06:36.831 --> 00:06:37.341
<v Speaker 1>to happen,</v>

128
00:06:37.341 --> 00:06:41.240
<v Speaker 1>where what you want to happen is happening because that's the best definition of</v>

129
00:06:41.241 --> 00:06:42.170
<v Speaker 1>being comfortable,</v>

130
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:42.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

131
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:43.461
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

132
00:06:43.461 --> 00:06:48.461
<v Speaker 1>you know where you are when you act and what you want to have happen happens.</v>

133
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:53.860
<v Speaker 1>That's a place that's home that's explored territory and what an unexplored</v>

134
00:06:54.081 --> 00:06:54.831
<v Speaker 1>territory is.</v>

135
00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:56.630
<v Speaker 1>The space beyond accounting higher,</v>

136
00:06:56.631 --> 00:06:59.600
<v Speaker 1>let's say the darkness of the 19 the jungle,</v>

137
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:02.930
<v Speaker 1>but also that place where the things that you didn't know what to expect or what</v>

138
00:07:02.931 --> 00:07:05.050
<v Speaker 1>happened and he's the best bring.</v>

139
00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.580
<v Speaker 1>So that's what the world is composed of,</v>

140
00:07:07.581 --> 00:07:09.180
<v Speaker 1>the substance of the world of experience.</v>

141
00:07:09.181 --> 00:07:12.860
<v Speaker 1>It's all those things that you want to have happen that you're familiar with and</v>

142
00:07:12.861 --> 00:07:14.870
<v Speaker 1>all those things that go bump in the night.</v>

143
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.280
<v Speaker 1>All those things that rise up out of the unknown to disrupt your,</v>

144
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.290
<v Speaker 1>the best laid plans of mice,</v>

145
00:07:21.291 --> 00:07:22.070
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

146
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:24.140
<v Speaker 1>And so you do have these two separate groups,</v>

147
00:07:24.141 --> 00:07:25.820
<v Speaker 1>logical systems in the way.</v>

148
00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:27.090
<v Speaker 1>And so that was all fine,</v>

149
00:07:27.091 --> 00:07:30.050
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately Goldberg quite nicely and,</v>

150
00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:30.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

151
00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.430
<v Speaker 1>it's been verified by their own neuropsychiatric status.</v>
