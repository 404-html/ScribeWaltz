1
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.630
<v Speaker 1>And in Western culture,</v>

2
00:00:07.631 --> 00:00:11.650
<v Speaker 1>the idea there is that do unto others as you would have them do unto you is the</v>

3
00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.740
<v Speaker 1>rule that it's the matter of rule that guides all other rules.</v>

4
00:00:14.741 --> 00:00:16.180
<v Speaker 1>Sort of like the one rainy in the,</v>

5
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.620
<v Speaker 1>in the Lord of the rings.</v>

6
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.510
<v Speaker 1>And so it's this consistent pattern of abstraction of ethical guidelines.</v>

7
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:23.703
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

8
00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:24.340
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

9
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.160
<v Speaker 1>so well and so that maps onto,</v>

10
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:28.001
<v Speaker 1>while there's a,</v>

11
00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:28.900
<v Speaker 1>there's a micro,</v>

12
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.930
<v Speaker 1>there's a micro level that you instruct people at and that then there's a more</v>

13
00:00:34.391 --> 00:00:37.990
<v Speaker 1>abstract level that you instruct them at and then there's a more abstract level.</v>

14
00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.320
<v Speaker 1>While maybe at that point you can't exactly directly instruct the,</v>

15
00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.350
<v Speaker 1>you remember in the Pinocchio Story,</v>

16
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.931
<v Speaker 1>Japan,</v>

17
00:00:44.931 --> 00:00:49.750
<v Speaker 1>Oh sits PANORG or the cricket Jiminny Sits Pinocchio Down and tries to lecture</v>

18
00:00:49.751 --> 00:00:52.510
<v Speaker 1>to him about what the highest level of moral virtual,</v>

19
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.960
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

20
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.780
<v Speaker 1>he sounds like a complete fraud.</v>

21
00:00:55.781 --> 00:00:57.550
<v Speaker 1>He sounds like a propaganda artist.</v>

22
00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.960
<v Speaker 1>He's a soap box preacher and Pinocchio doesn't understand them at all.</v>

23
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.110
<v Speaker 1>Why has to be acted out now maybe as a parent you can be a model for emulation,</v>

24
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.370
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

25
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.020
<v Speaker 1>so you're a model for imitation.</v>

26
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.280
<v Speaker 1>What you say matters,</v>

27
00:01:12.281 --> 00:01:15.070
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't say as much matter as much as what you do.</v>

28
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.770
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it would if what you said and what you did,</v>

29
00:01:17.771 --> 00:01:18.604
<v Speaker 1>we're the same.</v>

30
00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.290
<v Speaker 1>That's the ideal situation,</v>

31
00:01:20.291 --> 00:01:20.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

32
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:21.820
<v Speaker 1>That's what you want to do.</v>

33
00:01:21.821 --> 00:01:22.654
<v Speaker 1>If you're a parent,</v>

34
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.910
<v Speaker 1>if you say one thing and act differently,</v>

35
00:01:24.911 --> 00:01:28.810
<v Speaker 1>your kids will torture you to death and they're right to do it too because</v>

36
00:01:28.811 --> 00:01:30.580
<v Speaker 1>you're confused and confusing them,</v>

37
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.400
<v Speaker 1>makes them anxious and aggressive and they will go after you.</v>

38
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:34.361
<v Speaker 1>Consistency,</v>

39
00:01:34.361 --> 00:01:35.081
<v Speaker 1>consistency,</v>

40
00:01:35.081 --> 00:01:35.914
<v Speaker 1>consistency.</v>

41
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.420
<v Speaker 1>And if you can't provide it,</v>

42
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.590
<v Speaker 1>you'll drive them crazy.</v>

43
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.591
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

44
00:01:39.591 --> 00:01:39.840
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

45
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.910
<v Speaker 1>you want to bring your words and your actions into alignment.</v>

46
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.541
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

47
00:01:43.541 --> 00:01:45.190
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of the development of wisdom.</v>

48
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:46.383
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

49
00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.810
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

50
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.030
<v Speaker 1>so back to the brain.</v>

51
00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:54.483
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

52
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.321
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

53
00:01:55.321 --> 00:01:55.761
<v Speaker 1>So there's the,</v>

54
00:01:55.761 --> 00:01:57.260
<v Speaker 1>there's the motor homunculus.</v>

55
00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.920
<v Speaker 1>So now what I want to tell you about that is you just,</v>

56
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.730
<v Speaker 1>just think about what this thing is like.</v>

57
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.190
<v Speaker 1>It's taking a world to park</v>

58
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:06.900
<v Speaker 1>and it's talking about it.</v>

59
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.180
<v Speaker 1>So that's what a human being is like.</v>

60
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.931
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

61
00:02:09.931 --> 00:02:10.261
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

62
00:02:10.261 --> 00:02:12.570
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of an image of the mythological hero.</v>

63
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.270
<v Speaker 1>It's the thing that can speak magic words.</v>

64
00:02:15.271 --> 00:02:16.380
<v Speaker 1>And take the world's apart.</v>

65
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.430
<v Speaker 1>Take the world apart.</v>

66
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.220
<v Speaker 1>Now in one of the stories I'm going to tell you today,</v>

67
00:02:20.221 --> 00:02:22.560
<v Speaker 1>which is the story of the Enuma Elish,</v>

68
00:02:22.561 --> 00:02:24.750
<v Speaker 1>which is the oldest written story that we have.</v>

69
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.520
<v Speaker 1>It's a Mesopotamian story,</v>

70
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.500
<v Speaker 1>and it's from the same pool of stories that the creation account in genesis was</v>

71
00:02:31.501 --> 00:02:32.334
<v Speaker 1>extracted.</v>

72
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.440
<v Speaker 1>It isn't obvious what the temporal sequence was,</v>

73
00:02:34.441 --> 00:02:37.440
<v Speaker 1>but imagine there was a pool of stories in the Middle East that were of</v>

74
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.450
<v Speaker 1>indefinite age,</v>

75
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.130
<v Speaker 1>tens of thousands of years,</v>

76
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.160
<v Speaker 1>and it needs of the more developed in a slightly different way.</v>

77
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.720
<v Speaker 1>Although the themes underneath were,</v>

78
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:46.733
<v Speaker 1>were similar.</v>

79
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.640
<v Speaker 1>There are great parallels between the Mesopotamian creation account and the</v>

80
00:02:50.641 --> 00:02:52.860
<v Speaker 1>first part of the creation account in genesis.</v>

81
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.190
<v Speaker 1>So it was discovered in the late 19 hundreds and Isis just destroyed a,</v>

82
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.293
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

83
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.340
<v Speaker 1>a treasure trove of that sort of manuscripts.</v>

84
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.020
<v Speaker 1>So just so you know,</v>

85
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.160
<v Speaker 1>so at Nineveh,</v>

86
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.630
<v Speaker 1>so we can,</v>

87
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.500
<v Speaker 1>we can thank the war in the Middle East for the destruction of a huge,</v>

88
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.950
<v Speaker 1>a huge treasure house of irreplaceable human knowledge.</v>

89
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.110
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of that's happening that's happening very,</v>

90
00:03:17.111 --> 00:03:17.801
<v Speaker 1>very frequently.</v>

91
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:22.060
<v Speaker 1>It's an absolute bloody disgraceful catastrophe.</v>

92
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.380
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

93
00:03:24.381 --> 00:03:26.710
<v Speaker 1>so you know that that's the human being,</v>

94
00:03:26.711 --> 00:03:27.071
<v Speaker 1>lips,</v>

95
00:03:27.071 --> 00:03:27.550
<v Speaker 1>tongs,</v>

96
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.383
<v Speaker 1>hands,</v>

97
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.220
<v Speaker 1>and the face.</v>

98
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.220
<v Speaker 1>Your face is also extraordinarily amenable to voluntary manipulation.</v>

99
00:03:35.261 --> 00:03:39.640
<v Speaker 1>So you can learn to move single neurons in the tissue underneath your eyes.</v>

100
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.421
<v Speaker 1>That's how,</v>

101
00:03:40.421 --> 00:03:42.310
<v Speaker 1>that's how high resolution your faces.</v>

102
00:03:42.311 --> 00:03:44.950
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly because it's a broadcast screen,</v>

103
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.050
<v Speaker 1>which is why people are always looking at it.</v>

104
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.291
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

105
00:03:47.291 --> 00:03:48.850
<v Speaker 1>And that's why if you watch a movie,</v>

106
00:03:48.851 --> 00:03:52.420
<v Speaker 1>it's always concentrating on people's faces is because they're just broadcasting</v>

107
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.750
<v Speaker 1>what they're broadcasting their stories constantly and we're looking at their</v>

108
00:03:58.631 --> 00:03:59.290
<v Speaker 1>faces.</v>

109
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.220
<v Speaker 1>What are you looking at?</v>

110
00:04:00.221 --> 00:04:01.270
<v Speaker 1>What are your eyes pointing at?</v>

111
00:04:01.271 --> 00:04:01.991
<v Speaker 1>What are you up to?</v>

112
00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:03.220
<v Speaker 1>What's your emotional expression?</v>

113
00:04:03.221 --> 00:04:04.240
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to do next?</v>

114
00:04:04.241 --> 00:04:05.170
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about me?</v>

115
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.033
<v Speaker 1>Where are you going?</v>

116
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:11.080
<v Speaker 1>And your brought like you find someone who has had too much plastic surgery.</v>

117
00:04:11.081 --> 00:04:15.220
<v Speaker 1>Uncanny because their face is dead because you cannot tell what they're up to</v>

118
00:04:15.221 --> 00:04:15.480
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

119
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.100
<v Speaker 1>They've got this Zombie like aspect that's terrifying.</v>

120
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.660
<v Speaker 1>And people like that.</v>

121
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:20.021
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

122
00:04:20.021 --> 00:04:21.490
<v Speaker 1>people like that got killed.</v>

123
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.610
<v Speaker 1>That's why we're not like that or they didn't mate.</v>

124
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.830
<v Speaker 1>It's like you want to know what that other person is up to.</v>

125
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:27.761
<v Speaker 1>And I told you already,</v>

126
00:04:27.761 --> 00:04:29.440
<v Speaker 1>that's how the whites of our eyes evolved,</v>

127
00:04:29.441 --> 00:04:30.274
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

128
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't you remember that story.</v>

129
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.960
<v Speaker 1>Gorillas don't have that distinction between the Iris and the whites,</v>

130
00:04:34.961 --> 00:04:36.100
<v Speaker 1>not like human beings.</v>

131
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.660
<v Speaker 1>And our eyes are very sharp.</v>

132
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.890
<v Speaker 1>And one thing we really want to know is what are you looking at and why?</v>

133
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.760
<v Speaker 1>What are you up to?</v>

134
00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:44.230
<v Speaker 1>And if I can tell what you're looking at,</v>

135
00:04:44.231 --> 00:04:48.940
<v Speaker 1>I can infer what you're going to do and you want to broadcast that.</v>

136
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:49.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

137
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.160
<v Speaker 1>except when you don't want to broadcast it.</v>

138
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.120
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

139
00:04:52.121 --> 00:04:55.000
<v Speaker 1>most of the time you want to be pretty transparent to other people because</v>

140
00:04:55.001 --> 00:04:56.140
<v Speaker 1>otherwise they won't trust you.</v>

141
00:04:56.141 --> 00:04:57.280
<v Speaker 1>And if they don't trust you,</v>

142
00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.780
<v Speaker 1>they won't cooperate with you,</v>

143
00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.070
<v Speaker 1>they won't compete with you.</v>

144
00:05:00.071 --> 00:05:03.400
<v Speaker 1>And the probability that they'll come after you is extraordinarily high cause</v>

145
00:05:03.401 --> 00:05:06.760
<v Speaker 1>you'll be evil Predator in no time flat.</v>

146
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:08.223
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

147
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:09.573
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

148
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.880
<v Speaker 1>so we'll take a look at the brain from another perspective.</v>

149
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:18.280
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

150
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.040
<v Speaker 1>a lot of this I got from El Colon Goldberg,</v>

151
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.353
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

152
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.220
<v Speaker 1>well that's not exactly right.</v>

153
00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.870
<v Speaker 1>I had laid a,</v>

154
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.500
<v Speaker 1>laid this out before that,</v>

155
00:05:26.501 --> 00:05:30.220
<v Speaker 1>but I found Elkhorn Goldberg's writings afterwards and he was a student of</v>

156
00:05:30.221 --> 00:05:33.910
<v Speaker 1>lariats and he was trying to account for the y.</v>

157
00:05:33.911 --> 00:05:35.830
<v Speaker 1>We had different hemispheres roughly speaking,</v>

158
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:36.451
<v Speaker 1>because it's,</v>

159
00:05:36.451 --> 00:05:38.020
<v Speaker 1>it's not self evident that we should,</v>

160
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.880
<v Speaker 1>they're actually somewhat separate consciousnesses and they,</v>

161
00:05:41.881 --> 00:05:43.060
<v Speaker 1>they communicate,</v>

162
00:05:43.061 --> 00:05:44.830
<v Speaker 1>but the communication isn't complete.</v>

163
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.850
<v Speaker 1>It's like our brain is modularized and unified at the same time.</v>

164
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.730
<v Speaker 1>And you can think about it like a meeting of people.</v>

165
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.220
<v Speaker 1>Why do you want it Maude,</v>

166
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.000
<v Speaker 1>Maude muellerized while,</v>

167
00:05:55.001 --> 00:05:56.440
<v Speaker 1>so if one person goes down,</v>

168
00:05:56.441 --> 00:05:57.380
<v Speaker 1>all of them don't.</v>

169
00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:58.783
<v Speaker 1>That's one,</v>

170
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.313
<v Speaker 1>one reason.</v>

171
00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.240
<v Speaker 1>So it's some separation of function.</v>

172
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:03.620
<v Speaker 1>Why else?</v>

173
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:04.453
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

174
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:09.560
<v Speaker 1>each little module can do its own creative thing independently of the others.</v>

175
00:06:09.561 --> 00:06:10.371
<v Speaker 1>And that's useful.</v>

176
00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:12.170
<v Speaker 1>And then there can be communication between them.</v>

177
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.300
<v Speaker 1>And so there's,</v>

178
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.870
<v Speaker 1>there's utility in modularity and there's utility and integration.</v>

179
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.930
<v Speaker 1>And part of what we're trying to work out on the global political scene right</v>

180
00:06:20.931 --> 00:06:23.990
<v Speaker 1>now is how modular things should be and how integrated they should be.</v>

181
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.170
<v Speaker 1>And the European Community rushed into integration.</v>

182
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:32.660
<v Speaker 1>And that's bothering people dreadfully because they feel that the advantages of</v>

183
00:06:32.661 --> 00:06:34.700
<v Speaker 1>modularization have been washed away.</v>

184
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.850
<v Speaker 1>You saw that and maybe they're right because you saw what happened with Greece</v>

185
00:06:37.851 --> 00:06:38.684
<v Speaker 1>collapsed,</v>

186
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.740
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

187
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:40.610
<v Speaker 1>And Greece is very,</v>

188
00:06:40.611 --> 00:06:41.301
<v Speaker 1>very corrupt,</v>

189
00:06:41.301 --> 00:06:43.070
<v Speaker 1>incredibly corrupt and Germany,</v>

190
00:06:43.071 --> 00:06:45.770
<v Speaker 1>whatever else you might think about Germany is not corrupt.</v>

191
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.450
<v Speaker 1>And so the Isi tried to bring Greece and Germany together.</v>

192
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:51.383
<v Speaker 1>That didn't work.</v>

193
00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:52.850
<v Speaker 1>There was no unity there.</v>

194
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:57.310
<v Speaker 1>The modularity was actually useful and the fact that Greece was so destabilized</v>

195
00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:01.100
<v Speaker 1>and Italy also very corrupt and Spain also very corrupt,</v>

196
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.160
<v Speaker 1>was very shaky just about brought the whole thing down.</v>

197
00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:04.970
<v Speaker 1>It it.</v>

198
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:08.930
<v Speaker 1>The argument is the modularity would have been better conserved.</v>

199
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:10.191
<v Speaker 1>Well who knows,</v>

200
00:07:10.191 --> 00:07:10.431
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

201
00:07:10.431 --> 00:07:13.250
<v Speaker 1>Because modularity is useful and so is integration.</v>

202
00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:18.230
<v Speaker 1>But fall integration seems to be a mistake and so does full modularity.</v>

203
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.310
<v Speaker 1>How do you get that right?</v>

204
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:20.420
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>

205
00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:21.770
<v Speaker 1>That's why we're arguing about it.</v>

206
00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:26.550
<v Speaker 1>And right now there's a backlash or pulling away from the integration and you</v>

207
00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:27.620
<v Speaker 1>can see why too,</v>

208
00:07:27.621 --> 00:07:30.650
<v Speaker 1>because in 2008 with the American economy collapsed,</v>

209
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.690
<v Speaker 1>the world economy just about collapsed.</v>

210
00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:34.820
<v Speaker 1>That seems like a bad idea.</v>

211
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:35.151
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

212
00:07:35.151 --> 00:07:36.170
<v Speaker 1>you might want some,</v>

213
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:40.610
<v Speaker 1>some separateness so that if one system malfunctions and goes down,</v>

214
00:07:40.611 --> 00:07:42.920
<v Speaker 1>the whole bloody thing doesn't go into flames.</v>

215
00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:44.570
<v Speaker 1>And so we don't know.</v>

216
00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.100
<v Speaker 1>We don't know how to manage that.</v>

217
00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:46.963
<v Speaker 1>It's a really,</v>

218
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.740
<v Speaker 1>really complicated problem.</v>

219
00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.080
<v Speaker 1>So anyways.</v>

220
00:07:51.081 --> 00:07:51.381
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

221
00:07:51.381 --> 00:07:52.010
<v Speaker 1>So how did the,</v>

222
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:53.090
<v Speaker 1>how does the brain work?</v>

223
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:53.871
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

224
00:07:53.871 --> 00:07:57.290
<v Speaker 1>the left roughly speaking in right handed males,</v>

225
00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:01.690
<v Speaker 1>and the reason that I'm concentrating on right hand had males is because they're</v>

226
00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.830
<v Speaker 1>simpler in their neurological structure.</v>

227
00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:08.120
<v Speaker 1>Women have a more complicated neurological structure and lefthanded people tend</v>

228
00:08:08.121 --> 00:08:10.220
<v Speaker 1>to have a more complicated neurological structure.</v>

229
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:15.080
<v Speaker 1>So we'll just say that we'll just go with the standard model to begin with.</v>

230
00:08:15.081 --> 00:08:19.220
<v Speaker 1>And you can assume that the same systems are there in every person,</v>

231
00:08:19.221 --> 00:08:22.040
<v Speaker 1>but they're not laid out on the hemispheric structure quite as neatly,</v>

232
00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.150
<v Speaker 1>but they're still there.</v>

233
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:24.500
<v Speaker 1>So it's sort of like,</v>

234
00:08:24.501 --> 00:08:25.730
<v Speaker 1>these are tendencies.</v>

235
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:27.050
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

236
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:28.183
<v Speaker 1>if you're a,</v>

237
00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.760
<v Speaker 1>so there's a tendency for the right hemisphere to specialize for what's</v>

238
00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:36.620
<v Speaker 1>relatively unknown and the left hemisphere to specialize for what's relatively</v>

239
00:08:36.621 --> 00:08:37.454
<v Speaker 1>mastered.</v>

240
00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:39.470
<v Speaker 1>And you can think about it this way too,</v>

241
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:43.143
<v Speaker 3>left,</v>

242
00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:44.793
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

243
00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:46.660
<v Speaker 3>It's something like that.</v>

244
00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:47.770
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

245
00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:48.603
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

246
00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:49.681
<v Speaker 1>large scale,</v>

247
00:08:49.681 --> 00:08:53.280
<v Speaker 1>low resolution abstractions tend to be the province of the right high</v>

248
00:08:53.281 --> 00:08:54.061
<v Speaker 1>resolution.</v>

249
00:08:54.061 --> 00:08:57.030
<v Speaker 1>Detailed knowledge tend to be the province of the left.</v>

250
00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.410
<v Speaker 1>The left is linguistic.</v>

251
00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:02.220
<v Speaker 1>That's where the detailed structures manifest themselves in articulation,</v>

252
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:06.870
<v Speaker 1>but the fundamental difference between the left and right isn't language versus</v>

253
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:08.850
<v Speaker 1>non language.</v>

254
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.500
<v Speaker 1>The fundamental distinction is relatively explored and mastered versus</v>

255
00:09:13.501 --> 00:09:17.940
<v Speaker 1>relatively unexplored and not mastered and that's both in terms of structure.</v>

256
00:09:17.941 --> 00:09:20.340
<v Speaker 1>The right hemisphere has a less granular structure,</v>

257
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.840
<v Speaker 1>it's less differentiated.</v>

258
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:24.540
<v Speaker 1>It's also responsible mostly for negative emotion,</v>

259
00:09:24.541 --> 00:09:26.010
<v Speaker 1>especially in the prefrontal park.</v>

260
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:27.570
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is,</v>

261
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:27.901
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

262
00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:29.970
<v Speaker 1>how do you encounter what's absolutely unknown?</v>

263
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:33.330
<v Speaker 1>Imagination and emotion,</v>

264
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:34.583
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

265
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:37.860
<v Speaker 1>I told you that little experiment that you could do if you're alone in a house</v>

266
00:09:37.861 --> 00:09:40.800
<v Speaker 1>and you hear a strange noise at night in a room,</v>

267
00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:43.260
<v Speaker 1>turn off the lights and put your hand in the room.</v>

268
00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:46.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like your brain will just flash off monsters like mad.</v>

269
00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:46.441
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

270
00:09:46.441 --> 00:09:49.800
<v Speaker 1>you'll be nervous cause that what's in that room.</v>

271
00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.570
<v Speaker 1>Something to make you nervous.</v>

272
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.670
<v Speaker 1>That's a very low resolution category,</v>

273
00:09:53.671 --> 00:09:53.881
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

274
00:09:53.881 --> 00:09:55.860
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's a,</v>

275
00:09:56.130 --> 00:10:00.810
<v Speaker 1>it's some indeterminate manifestation of the category of things that might hurt</v>

276
00:10:00.811 --> 00:10:01.440
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

277
00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.640
<v Speaker 1>Very low resolution,</v>

278
00:10:02.641 --> 00:10:03.960
<v Speaker 1>but a very smart category.</v>

279
00:10:03.961 --> 00:10:05.220
<v Speaker 1>It's like don't put your hand in there.</v>

280
00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:07.530
<v Speaker 1>You put your hand in there and you watch your imagination.</v>

281
00:10:07.531 --> 00:10:08.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like monsters.</v>

282
00:10:08.671 --> 00:10:12.060
<v Speaker 1>It'll generate monsters like Matt and that's what the right hemisphere is doing.</v>

283
00:10:12.061 --> 00:10:16.050
<v Speaker 1>It's saying what's in there is an exemplar of the category of things that are</v>

284
00:10:16.051 --> 00:10:16.501
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>

285
00:10:16.501 --> 00:10:20.670
<v Speaker 1>Here's a bunch of images of those things and that thing in there is going to</v>

286
00:10:20.671 --> 00:10:22.200
<v Speaker 1>partake of that essence.</v>

287
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.380
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very low resolution hypothesis.</v>

288
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:27.690
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of what horror movies do with people.</v>

289
00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:27.961
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

290
00:10:27.961 --> 00:10:32.640
<v Speaker 1>they sort of lead them through that initial process and so and so that's what</v>

291
00:10:32.641 --> 00:10:33.000
<v Speaker 1>the right,</v>

292
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.680
<v Speaker 1>the right hemisphere seems to me to be dominated by dominated by subcortical</v>

293
00:10:37.681 --> 00:10:38.514
<v Speaker 1>processes.</v>

294
00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:40.280
<v Speaker 1>There's the left hemisphere is reversed,</v>

295
00:10:40.281 --> 00:10:42.420
<v Speaker 1>the cortex is more or less got dominion.</v>

296
00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:44.940
<v Speaker 1>And so the right hemisphere,</v>

297
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:46.740
<v Speaker 1>while we'll walk through this neurologically,</v>

298
00:10:46.741 --> 00:10:51.240
<v Speaker 1>but the right hemisphere is responds rapidly to what's unknown.</v>

299
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:54.390
<v Speaker 1>And that's that subcortical that the hippocampus is,</v>

300
00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:57.360
<v Speaker 1>is doing an awful lot of that noting a mismatch.</v>

301
00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:00.000
<v Speaker 1>And then it's using the right hemisphere to,</v>

302
00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:05.390
<v Speaker 1>to abstractly represent what the possibility space is in relationship down</v>

303
00:11:06.481 --> 00:11:07.410
<v Speaker 1>expected things.</v>

304
00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:11.580
<v Speaker 1>And then the right hemisphere is tracking that continually,</v>

305
00:11:11.581 --> 00:11:15.990
<v Speaker 1>what those unexpected things are and coming up with models of what you haven't</v>

306
00:11:15.991 --> 00:11:16.830
<v Speaker 1>yet mastered.</v>

307
00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.830
<v Speaker 1>And that's kept separate from the left hemisphere,</v>

308
00:11:19.831 --> 00:11:23.490
<v Speaker 1>which already has functional models and you don't want to blast the left</v>

309
00:11:23.491 --> 00:11:26.540
<v Speaker 1>hemisphere continually with enormous information cause you blow out its</v>

310
00:11:26.541 --> 00:11:28.890
<v Speaker 1>structure and then you don't know what to do.</v>

311
00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:34.130
<v Speaker 1>So the right hemisphere generates new models in some sense out of nothing.</v>

312
00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:36.870
<v Speaker 1>And then when the time is right,</v>

313
00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:40.620
<v Speaker 1>taps information into the left hemisphere slowly so that it doesn't disrupt its</v>

314
00:11:40.621 --> 00:11:41.520
<v Speaker 1>function too much.</v>

315
00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:45.360
<v Speaker 1>And that's a lot of that seems to happen when you're dreaming by the way it</v>

316
00:11:45.361 --> 00:11:46.194
<v Speaker 1>happens at night.</v>

317
00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.330
<v Speaker 1>So in what happens with the dreams,</v>

318
00:11:48.331 --> 00:11:49.710
<v Speaker 1>you think about how dreams work,</v>

319
00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:54.130
<v Speaker 1>cause you might think of dreams as part of that process where ideas come to be.</v>

320
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:56.170
<v Speaker 1>So they're low resolution to begin with.</v>

321
00:11:56.171 --> 00:11:57.250
<v Speaker 1>Mostly a majestic,</v>

322
00:11:57.251 --> 00:11:59.560
<v Speaker 1>really highly emotional and incoherent,</v>

323
00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:01.780
<v Speaker 1>less coherent.</v>

324
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:05.710
<v Speaker 1>Why you can't be coherent unless you know what to do.</v>

325
00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:06.311
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>

326
00:12:06.311 --> 00:12:06.611
<v Speaker 1>B,</v>

327
00:12:06.611 --> 00:12:06.911
<v Speaker 1>c,</v>

328
00:12:06.911 --> 00:12:07.241
<v Speaker 1>d,</v>

329
00:12:07.241 --> 00:12:07.511
<v Speaker 1>e,</v>

330
00:12:07.511 --> 00:12:08.650
<v Speaker 1>f if that's working,</v>

331
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:09.760
<v Speaker 1>you've got coherence.</v>

332
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.800
<v Speaker 1>But if you're dealing with something you don't know,</v>

333
00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.260
<v Speaker 1>you have to muck about with your category structures.</v>

334
00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.850
<v Speaker 1>And that's what dreams do.</v>

335
00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:16.930
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

336
00:12:16.931 --> 00:12:18.250
<v Speaker 1>when you're interpreting a dream,</v>

337
00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:20.380
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you watch for is the dream.</v>

338
00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:21.790
<v Speaker 1>The dream presents this.</v>

339
00:12:21.791 --> 00:12:22.624
<v Speaker 1>And then this.</v>

340
00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:23.650
<v Speaker 1>That's called metonymy.</v>

341
00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:24.220
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

342
00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.450
<v Speaker 1>from a literary perspective,</v>

343
00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:28.690
<v Speaker 1>and what that implies is this is related to this in some way.</v>

344
00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:31.000
<v Speaker 1>Why else would they be code activated?</v>

345
00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:31.961
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

346
00:12:31.961 --> 00:12:32.471
<v Speaker 1>people say,</v>

347
00:12:32.471 --> 00:12:32.651
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

348
00:12:32.651 --> 00:12:33.490
<v Speaker 1>dreams are random.</v>

349
00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.320
<v Speaker 1>That's the stupidest theory I've ever heard.</v>

350
00:12:35.321 --> 00:12:36.760
<v Speaker 1>Like white noise is random.</v>

351
00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:38.860
<v Speaker 1>Dreams are not random.</v>

352
00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:40.300
<v Speaker 1>They're hard to understand,</v>

353
00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:42.340
<v Speaker 1>but they're anything but random.</v>

354
00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.860
<v Speaker 1>There are more random than real life.</v>

355
00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:45.341
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

356
00:12:45.341 --> 00:12:49.390
<v Speaker 1>that's because what you don't understand these really random and you're</v>

357
00:12:49.391 --> 00:12:53.080
<v Speaker 1>organized and there has to be an intermediary that's sort of quasi random</v>

358
00:12:53.081 --> 00:12:55.510
<v Speaker 1>between the more you never get from one to the other,</v>

359
00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:57.580
<v Speaker 1>and dreams and fantasies,</v>

360
00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.061
<v Speaker 1>myths,</v>

361
00:12:58.061 --> 00:13:03.010
<v Speaker 1>all of that is part of that process that it stretches you out beyond what you</v>

362
00:13:03.011 --> 00:13:03.251
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

363
00:13:03.251 --> 00:13:04.630
<v Speaker 1>into the absolute unknown.</v>
