1
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:06.900
<v Speaker 1>Did,</v>

2
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.980
<v Speaker 1>these are dark musings and I would say how much of the antipathy towards man</v>

3
00:00:10.981 --> 00:00:13.650
<v Speaker 1>that's being generated by say college age women is,</v>

4
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:14.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:14.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.810
<v Speaker 1>deep repugnance for the role that they've been designed and a disappointment</v>

7
00:00:18.811 --> 00:00:20.180
<v Speaker 1>with the man who,</v>

8
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:20.521
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:21.570
<v Speaker 1>like you think of those,</v>

10
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.670
<v Speaker 1>is it Carpathian um,</v>

11
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:24.030
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

12
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:24.331
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

13
00:00:24.331 --> 00:00:24.740
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

14
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:25.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

15
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.253
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

16
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.113
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

17
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.770
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember the culture that the basic Marit marital written routine was to</v>

18
00:00:31.771 --> 00:00:35.910
<v Speaker 1>ride into the village and grabbed the Bryden runaway with her on a horse.</v>

19
00:00:35.911 --> 00:00:36.121
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

20
00:00:36.121 --> 00:00:36.840
<v Speaker 1>It's like the,</v>

21
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.840
<v Speaker 1>like the motorcycle gang member who rips the too naive woman out of girl,</v>

22
00:00:42.031 --> 00:00:43.580
<v Speaker 1>out of the bosom of her family,</v>

23
00:00:43.581 --> 00:00:43.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

24
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.351
<v Speaker 2>Say by women.</v>

25
00:00:44.351 --> 00:00:44.940
<v Speaker 2>That's all I can think of.</v>

26
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:45.411
<v Speaker 2>Ancient myth.</v>

27
00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:45.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

28
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:46.970
<v Speaker 2>There used to be bride stealing.</v>

29
00:00:46.971 --> 00:00:47.780
<v Speaker 2>It was quite,</v>

30
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:48.380
<v Speaker 2>quite,</v>

31
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.280
<v Speaker 2>quite widespread.</v>

32
00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:49.691
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

33
00:00:49.691 --> 00:00:49.841
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

34
00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:53.650
<v Speaker 1>So I kind of wonder if part of the reason that modern university age women</v>

35
00:00:53.651 --> 00:00:58.630
<v Speaker 1>aren't so aren't so angry is because that fundamental feminine role is actually</v>

36
00:00:58.631 --> 00:00:59.640
<v Speaker 1>being denied to them.</v>

37
00:00:59.641 --> 00:01:00.310
<v Speaker 1>And they're,</v>

38
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.020
<v Speaker 1>they're objecting to that at a really,</v>

39
00:01:02.021 --> 00:01:03.400
<v Speaker 1>really fundamental level,</v>

40
00:01:03.401 --> 00:01:04.560
<v Speaker 1>like a level of,</v>

41
00:01:04.561 --> 00:01:06.400
<v Speaker 1>of primitive outrage at,</v>

42
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.500
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

43
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.880
<v Speaker 2>what's happened is the chaos that my generation of the any sixties be creased</v>

44
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.170
<v Speaker 2>through the sexual revolution.</v>

45
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.930
<v Speaker 2>I went when I arrived in college and I need 64,</v>

46
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.171
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

47
00:01:16.171 --> 00:01:20.280
<v Speaker 2>W w the colleges were still acting in local parentes in place of a parent.</v>

48
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.960
<v Speaker 2>So my dormitory,</v>

49
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

50
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.150
<v Speaker 2>all women's dormitory,</v>

51
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.631
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

52
00:01:24.631 --> 00:01:24.781
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

53
00:01:24.781 --> 00:01:27.300
<v Speaker 2>women had to sign in at 11 o'clock at night.</v>

54
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.190
<v Speaker 2>The men could run free the entire night.</v>

55
00:01:29.191 --> 00:01:32.100
<v Speaker 2>So it was my generation of women that rose up and said,</v>

56
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.130
<v Speaker 2>give us the same freedom as men have.</v>

57
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.360
<v Speaker 2>And the college's replied,</v>

58
00:01:36.361 --> 00:01:37.140
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

59
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.670
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

60
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.900
<v Speaker 2>in the world is dangerous that you could be raped,</v>

61
00:01:39.901 --> 00:01:39.981
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

62
00:01:39.981 --> 00:01:41.310
<v Speaker 2>we have to protect you against.</v>

63
00:01:41.311 --> 00:01:41.550
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

64
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.690
<v Speaker 2>And would we said,</v>

65
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:42.961
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

66
00:01:42.961 --> 00:01:46.620
<v Speaker 2>was give us the freedom to risk rate.</v>

67
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.080
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

68
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.620
<v Speaker 2>So that what?</v>

69
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.470
<v Speaker 2>That today's women don't understand.</v>

70
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.440
<v Speaker 2>It's a freedom that you want.</v>

71
00:01:51.441 --> 00:01:54.600
<v Speaker 2>It's the same freedom that give gay men have when they go and they pick up a</v>

72
00:01:54.601 --> 00:01:55.590
<v Speaker 2>stranger someplace.</v>

73
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.610
<v Speaker 2>They know it's dangerous.</v>

74
00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.040
<v Speaker 2>They know that they could end up beaten up or killed.</v>

75
00:01:59.041 --> 00:01:59.341
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

76
00:01:59.341 --> 00:02:01.620
<v Speaker 2>But they find it hat if you want freedom,</v>

77
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:02.940
<v Speaker 2>if you want equality,</v>

78
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:03.181
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

79
00:02:03.181 --> 00:02:04.740
<v Speaker 2>then you have to stop behaving like a man.</v>

80
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.310
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

81
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.310
<v Speaker 2>So what we did is we gave freedom to these young women for several generations,</v>

82
00:02:10.981 --> 00:02:15.930
<v Speaker 2>but my generation had been raised and I far more resilient and robust culture.</v>

83
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.081
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

84
00:02:16.081 --> 00:02:17.430
<v Speaker 2>We had the strength,</v>

85
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.771
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

86
00:02:17.771 --> 00:02:20.640
<v Speaker 2>To know what we wanted and to fight for what we wanted.</v>

87
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.510
<v Speaker 2>These young women had been raised in this protective terribly protected ways.</v>

88
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.900
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

89
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.150
<v Speaker 2>So I think in some strange th you know,</v>

90
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.950
<v Speaker 2>the fashion that,</v>

91
00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.800
<v Speaker 2>that all of these demands for intrusion from these,</v>

92
00:02:31.801 --> 00:02:32.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

93
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.700
<v Speaker 2>Stalinist committees,</v>

94
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:35.191
<v Speaker 2>sexual,</v>

95
00:02:35.191 --> 00:02:35.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

96
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.560
<v Speaker 2>investigating dates and so on.</v>

97
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.540
<v Speaker 2>It's a way to re institute,</v>

98
00:02:39.541 --> 00:02:39.781
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

99
00:02:39.781 --> 00:02:42.300
<v Speaker 2>The rules that my generation through out the window and I,</v>

100
00:02:42.301 --> 00:02:44.530
<v Speaker 2>so I think these young women are desperate now.</v>

101
00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:45.061
<v Speaker 2>Only that,</v>

102
00:02:45.061 --> 00:02:47.930
<v Speaker 2>but I have spoken out very strongly in,</v>

103
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:48.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

104
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.450
<v Speaker 2>ended up in a piece I wrote for Time magazine isn't my most recent book</v>

105
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.110
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] the racing,</v>

106
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.750
<v Speaker 2>the drinking age in this country.</v>

107
00:02:54.751 --> 00:02:54.961
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

108
00:02:54.961 --> 00:02:56.700
<v Speaker 2>From 18 to 21 okay.</v>

109
00:02:56.701 --> 00:02:58.050
<v Speaker 2>Has had a direct result.</v>

110
00:02:58.051 --> 00:02:58.351
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

111
00:02:58.351 --> 00:02:59.110
<v Speaker 2>In these,</v>

112
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.570
<v Speaker 2>in these disasters of binge drinking fraternity parties because they tend to</v>

113
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.200
<v Speaker 2>elect couch students the way we could go out at as freshmen have a beer,</v>

114
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.180
<v Speaker 2>sit any protected adult environment,</v>

115
00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:13.260
<v Speaker 2>learn how to have discourse with the opposite sex in,</v>

116
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.550
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

117
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.810
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

118
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.300
<v Speaker 2>in a safe environment.</v>

119
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.661
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

120
00:03:16.661 --> 00:03:17.200
<v Speaker 2>And so on.</v>

121
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.790
<v Speaker 2>And you and not today.</v>

122
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.971
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

123
00:03:18.971 --> 00:03:22.420
<v Speaker 2>Because because of the stupid rule that the young people can't even buy a drink.</v>

124
00:03:22.421 --> 00:03:22.821
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

125
00:03:22.821 --> 00:03:23.000
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

126
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.240
<v Speaker 2>in a bar until the 21 we have these,</v>

127
00:03:25.241 --> 00:03:26.370
<v Speaker 2>the fraternity parties that aren't,</v>

128
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.360
<v Speaker 2>that are like the caveman era.</v>

129
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.661
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

130
00:03:28.661 --> 00:03:29.301
<v Speaker 2>of course in,</v>

131
00:03:29.301 --> 00:03:30.134
<v Speaker 2>in this modern age,</v>

132
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.510
<v Speaker 2>this is an advantage as men,</v>

133
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.690
<v Speaker 2>gay men want to hook up and then want to have sex.</v>

134
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.520
<v Speaker 2>Women don't understand what men want.</v>

135
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.450
<v Speaker 2>Women,</v>

136
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.090
<v Speaker 2>women are like put out because they're hoping that maybe the man will continue</v>

137
00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:41.110
<v Speaker 2>to be interested in them.</v>

138
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.560
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

139
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.000
<v Speaker 2>The man just wants experience.</v>

140
00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:43.241
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

141
00:03:43.241 --> 00:03:46.060
<v Speaker 2>And that the hormones drive toward door to me.</v>

142
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.411
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

143
00:03:46.411 --> 00:03:46.741
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

144
00:03:46.741 --> 00:03:47.980
<v Speaker 2>I've theorized okay.</v>

145
00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:48.610
<v Speaker 2>That the,</v>

146
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.791
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

147
00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:48.901
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

148
00:03:48.901 --> 00:03:51.720
<v Speaker 2>that the sex drive and men is intertwined with,</v>

149
00:03:51.721 --> 00:03:52.840
<v Speaker 2>with hunted pursuits.</v>

150
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:53.693
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

151
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.091
<v Speaker 2>I feel absolutely,</v>

152
00:03:55.091 --> 00:03:56.320
<v Speaker 2>this is what women don't understand.</v>

153
00:03:56.321 --> 00:03:56.710
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

154
00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.700
<v Speaker 2>If women understood what I understand from my transgender perspective,</v>

155
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.633
<v Speaker 2>all right.</v>

156
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:02.980
<v Speaker 2>These women on the streets,</v>

157
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.823
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

158
00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.230
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm obviously,</v>

159
00:04:05.231 --> 00:04:05.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

160
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.950
<v Speaker 2>Madonna and admirer and you know,</v>

161
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:08.460
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

162
00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.870
<v Speaker 2>I support pornography and prostitution,</v>

163
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.170
<v Speaker 2>so I don't want what I'm about to save to seem conservative and then it isn't,</v>

164
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.501
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

165
00:04:14.501 --> 00:04:16.870
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying is the women on the street,</v>

166
00:04:16.871 --> 00:04:17.530
<v Speaker 2>young women,</v>

167
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.950
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

168
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:18.610
<v Speaker 2>Who are,</v>

169
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:19.870
<v Speaker 2>who are jogging.</v>

170
00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:20.201
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

171
00:04:20.201 --> 00:04:21.430
<v Speaker 2>With no bra on.</v>

172
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.940
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

173
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.300
<v Speaker 2>Short shorts and have and have earbuds in their ears.</v>

174
00:04:25.301 --> 00:04:25.720
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

175
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.850
<v Speaker 2>Just jogging along line.</v>

176
00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.940
<v Speaker 2>And I saw these women do not understand the nature of the human mind.</v>

177
00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.340
<v Speaker 2>They do not understand the nature of psychosis.</v>

178
00:04:33.341 --> 00:04:33.820
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

179
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.880
<v Speaker 2>And this intertwining them talking about the hunt,</v>

180
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.200
<v Speaker 2>the hunt and pursuit thing.</v>

181
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.800
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

182
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.900
<v Speaker 2>They're triggering a hunter thing.</v>

183
00:04:40.901 --> 00:04:45.820
<v Speaker 2>Just what do what you have talked about in terms of the zebra heard.</v>

184
00:04:45.821 --> 00:04:46.420
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

185
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.670
<v Speaker 2>They are triggering the hunt game,</v>

186
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:49.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

187
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.781
<v Speaker 2>impulse.</v>

188
00:04:49.781 --> 00:04:50.320
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

189
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.760
<v Speaker 2>In psychotic men.</v>

190
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:52.211
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

191
00:04:52.211 --> 00:04:53.350
<v Speaker 2>I have here the,</v>

192
00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.210
<v Speaker 2>there goes a very appetizing and,</v>

193
00:04:56.211 --> 00:04:58.360
<v Speaker 2>and totally oblivious animal.</v>

194
00:04:58.361 --> 00:04:58.571
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

195
00:04:58.571 --> 00:04:59.560
<v Speaker 2>Bouncing along here.</v>

196
00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.740
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

197
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:00.110
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

198
00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.701
<v Speaker 2>And we're,</v>

199
00:05:00.701 --> 00:05:03.700
<v Speaker 2>we're in a period now where psychosis is not understood at all.</v>

200
00:05:03.701 --> 00:05:03.911
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

201
00:05:03.911 --> 00:05:04.350
<v Speaker 2>Do you know yet,</v>

202
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.961
<v Speaker 2>young women have,</v>

203
00:05:04.961 --> 00:05:09.100
<v Speaker 2>you had to have had no exposure to movies like psycho.</v>

204
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.963
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

205
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.561
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

206
00:05:10.561 --> 00:05:10.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

207
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.200
<v Speaker 2>the kind of rapists serial murderer thing and so on,</v>

208
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.180
<v Speaker 2>the kind of strange dynamic that has to do with the,</v>

209
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:18.400
<v Speaker 2>with the assault on the,</v>

210
00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:19.420
<v Speaker 2>on the mother and Mongo,</v>

211
00:05:19.421 --> 00:05:19.631
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

212
00:05:19.631 --> 00:05:19.731
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

213
00:05:19.731 --> 00:05:20.200
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

214
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.441
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

215
00:05:20.441 --> 00:05:21.700
<v Speaker 2>in the mind of the psychotic.</v>

216
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.460
<v Speaker 2>But I think that's an incredible naivete.</v>

217
00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:28.270
<v Speaker 2>These young women are emerging and going to college and in this like incredible</v>

218
00:05:28.271 --> 00:05:30.370
<v Speaker 2>Dinesen environment of,</v>

219
00:05:30.371 --> 00:05:30.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

220
00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.791
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

221
00:05:30.791 --> 00:05:34.450
<v Speaker 2>a sec orgiastic sexual experience in fraternity houses,</v>

222
00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.310
<v Speaker 2>they're completely unprepared for it,</v>

223
00:05:36.311 --> 00:05:36.590
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

224
00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.800
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

225
00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.260
<v Speaker 2>and so you're getting all this outrage.</v>

226
00:05:38.261 --> 00:05:43.261
<v Speaker 2>So feminist rhetoric has gotten more and more extreme in its portrayal of men is</v>

227
00:05:43.331 --> 00:05:43.720
<v Speaker 2>evil.</v>

228
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.471
<v Speaker 2>But in fact,</v>

229
00:05:44.471 --> 00:05:44.681
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

230
00:05:44.681 --> 00:05:44.821
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

231
00:05:44.821 --> 00:05:46.190
<v Speaker 2>what we have is a cask is a,</v>

232
00:05:46.191 --> 00:05:47.890
<v Speaker 2>is a chaos in the sexual realm.</v>

233
00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.610
<v Speaker 2>The girls have not been told anything real.</v>

234
00:05:51.611 --> 00:05:52.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

235
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.460
<v Speaker 2>in terms of biological substrate,</v>

236
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:55.343
<v Speaker 2>them just sexual</v>

237
00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 2>what constitutes consent</v>

238
00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:58.580
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

239
00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:59.241
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

240
00:05:59.241 --> 00:06:03.620
<v Speaker 1>And it's become something that's essentially portrayed linguistically as a</v>

241
00:06:03.621 --> 00:06:05.570
<v Speaker 1>sequence of progressive contracts,</v>

242
00:06:05.571 --> 00:06:06.500
<v Speaker 1>which you know,</v>

243
00:06:06.501 --> 00:06:07.010
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

244
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.340
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

245
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:08.121
<v Speaker 1>well I think,</v>

246
00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:08.331
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

247
00:06:08.331 --> 00:06:12.110
<v Speaker 1>I've thought for a while that we're living in the delusional fantasy of a naive</v>

248
00:06:12.111 --> 00:06:15.410
<v Speaker 1>13 year old girl that's basically sums up our culture.</v>

249
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.740
<v Speaker 1>And I look at all these sexual rules that permeate the,</v>

250
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.590
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

251
00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.380
<v Speaker 1>the academia and I think two things.</v>

252
00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:22.880
<v Speaker 1>The first thing I think as well,</v>

253
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.150
<v Speaker 1>I know because I was an alcohol researcher for a long time,</v>

254
00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:30.890
<v Speaker 1>and you know that 50% of violent crimes are directly attributable to alcohol.</v>

255
00:06:30.891 --> 00:06:31.940
<v Speaker 1>So if you're a murdered,</v>

256
00:06:31.941 --> 00:06:36.140
<v Speaker 1>there's about a 50% chance that you're drunk and about a 50% chance that the</v>

257
00:06:36.141 --> 00:06:37.640
<v Speaker 1>person who kills you is drunk.</v>

258
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.060
<v Speaker 1>And the alcohol is the only drug that we know that actually amplifies</v>

259
00:06:41.061 --> 00:06:41.840
<v Speaker 1>aggression.</v>

260
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.640
<v Speaker 1>It does that in laboratory situations.</v>

261
00:06:43.641 --> 00:06:45.140
<v Speaker 1>Plus it's a great disinhibitor.</v>

262
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:45.411
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

263
00:06:45.411 --> 00:06:46.850
<v Speaker 1>So what alcohol does is it,</v>

264
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.050
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't make you oblivious to the future consequences of your action because</v>

265
00:06:51.051 --> 00:06:54.590
<v Speaker 1>if you ask someone who's drunk about the consequences of something stupid,</v>

266
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.870
<v Speaker 1>they can tell you what the consequences are,</v>

267
00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:58.670
<v Speaker 1>but it makes you not care.</v>

268
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.900
<v Speaker 1>And it does that because it's technically an anxiety alytic like,</v>

269
00:07:01.901 --> 00:07:02.240
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

270
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.520
<v Speaker 1>like barbiturates are like benzodiazepines.</v>

271
00:07:04.521 --> 00:07:05.480
<v Speaker 1>And it also has a,</v>

272
00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:06.291
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

273
00:07:06.291 --> 00:07:07.370
<v Speaker 1>an activating,</v>

274
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:08.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

275
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

276
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.130
<v Speaker 1>property for many people who drink.</v>

277
00:07:10.131 --> 00:07:10.620
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

278
00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:11.960
<v Speaker 1>it's a stimulant and a,</v>

279
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.320
<v Speaker 1>and an exile lytic at the same time and a very,</v>

280
00:07:15.321 --> 00:07:16.154
<v Speaker 1>very potent,</v>

281
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:17.540
<v Speaker 1>very potent for both of them.</v>

282
00:07:17.541 --> 00:07:18.200
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

283
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:18.441
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

284
00:07:18.441 --> 00:07:22.460
<v Speaker 1>we put young people together and douse them in alcohol right at the binge</v>

285
00:07:22.461 --> 00:07:23.294
<v Speaker 1>drinking level.</v>

286
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:24.020
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

287
00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.210
<v Speaker 1>which also interferes with memory consolidation,</v>

288
00:07:26.211 --> 00:07:28.220
<v Speaker 1>which of course makes things much more complex.</v>

289
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:31.970
<v Speaker 1>And then we're surprised when there are sexual misadventures and you know,</v>

290
00:07:31.971 --> 00:07:36.380
<v Speaker 1>and then it's also attributed almost purely to the predatory element that's,</v>

291
00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:36.950
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

292
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:37.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

293
00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:38.690
<v Speaker 1>part and parcel of masculinity.</v>

294
00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:39.200
<v Speaker 1>But a true,</v>

295
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.830
<v Speaker 1>a tremendous amount of that is also naivety and stupidity.</v>

296
00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:42.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

297
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:46.010
<v Speaker 1>because we expect like eight to 18 year old guys,</v>

298
00:07:46.011 --> 00:07:47.420
<v Speaker 1>especially the ones that aren't,</v>

299
00:07:47.421 --> 00:07:49.040
<v Speaker 1>that haven't been successful with girls,</v>

300
00:07:49.041 --> 00:07:53.390
<v Speaker 1>which is like 85% of them because the successful men are a very small percentage</v>

301
00:07:53.391 --> 00:07:54.224
<v Speaker 1>of men.</v>

302
00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:57.650
<v Speaker 1>The 85% who haven't been successful with men or with women,</v>

303
00:07:57.651 --> 00:07:59.630
<v Speaker 1>they don't know what the hell they're doing at all.</v>

304
00:07:59.750 --> 00:07:59.991
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

305
00:07:59.991 --> 00:08:04.580
<v Speaker 1>In part of the reason they're getting drunk is to garner up enough courage to</v>

306
00:08:04.581 --> 00:08:06.200
<v Speaker 1>actually make an advance.</v>

307
00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:06.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

308
00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.410
<v Speaker 1>because I think another thing that women don't understand,</v>

309
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:14.620
<v Speaker 1>especially with regards to young men is just exactly how petrifying a attractive</v>

310
00:08:14.841 --> 00:08:19.800
<v Speaker 1>woman whose of say somewhat higher status actually is to a young guy on it.</v>

311
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:23.450
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of guys that right knee constantly and people that I've worked with</v>

312
00:08:23.451 --> 00:08:24.680
<v Speaker 1>that are so terrified of women,</v>

313
00:08:24.681 --> 00:08:25.730
<v Speaker 1>they can't even talk to them.</v>

314
00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:26.541
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

315
00:08:26.541 --> 00:08:27.374
<v Speaker 1>very common.</v>

316
00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:27.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

317
00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.090
<v Speaker 2>I take a very firm position,</v>

318
00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.960
<v Speaker 2>which is that I want college administration,</v>

319
00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:36.090
<v Speaker 2>so stay totally out of the social lives of the students.</v>

320
00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:37.770
<v Speaker 2>If a crime is committed,</v>

321
00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:39.060
<v Speaker 2>it should be reported to the police.</v>

322
00:08:39.061 --> 00:08:41.250
<v Speaker 2>I've been writing now for 2050 of 25 years now.</v>

323
00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:41.790
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

324
00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:42.050
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

325
00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:47.050
<v Speaker 2>but there's not the business of any college administration to take any notice of</v>

326
00:08:47.071 --> 00:08:48.750
<v Speaker 2>what the students say to each other,</v>

327
00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:51.360
<v Speaker 2>say to each other as well as do with each other.</v>

328
00:08:51.361 --> 00:08:51.810
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

329
00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:53.190
<v Speaker 2>I want it to totally stop.</v>

330
00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:54.650
<v Speaker 2>Is Fascism of the work?</v>

331
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:55.350
<v Speaker 2>Agree</v>

332
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:56.010
<v Speaker 1>while it's sitting?</v>

333
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.890
<v Speaker 2>It's think it's fascism of the worst time because it's an,</v>

334
00:08:58.891 --> 00:09:00.600
<v Speaker 2>it's a new kind of fascism,</v>

335
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:01.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

336
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:02.190
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

337
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:04.410
<v Speaker 2>it's partly generated by legislation.</v>

338
00:09:04.411 --> 00:09:04.741
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

339
00:09:04.741 --> 00:09:08.940
<v Speaker 2>like the title nine men memo that was written in 2011 I recently got a copy of</v>

340
00:09:08.941 --> 00:09:09.870
<v Speaker 2>that God damn thing.</v>

341
00:09:09.871 --> 00:09:12.180
<v Speaker 2>That was one polluting bit of legislation.</v>

342
00:09:12.181 --> 00:09:12.571
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>

343
00:09:12.571 --> 00:09:16.920
<v Speaker 2>that memo basically told universities that unless they set up a parallel court</v>

344
00:09:16.921 --> 00:09:17.281
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>

345
00:09:17.281 --> 00:09:18.870
<v Speaker 2>they were going to be denied central funding.</v>

346
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.180
<v Speaker 2>It is absolutely unbelievable.</v>

347
00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:21.580
<v Speaker 2>Incredible.</v>

348
00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:21.720
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

349
00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:21.881
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

350
00:09:21.881 --> 00:09:22.790
<v Speaker 2>and w in the law,</v>

351
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:24.880
<v Speaker 2>the leftists are supporting this.</v>

352
00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:25.421
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

353
00:09:25.421 --> 00:09:25.811
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

354
00:09:25.811 --> 00:09:26.431
<v Speaker 2>It's just this,</v>

355
00:09:26.431 --> 00:09:26.980
<v Speaker 2>and this show is,</v>

356
00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:28.510
<v Speaker 2>there is no authentic campus.</v>

357
00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:29.530
<v Speaker 2>Leftism I'm sorry.</v>

358
00:09:29.531 --> 00:09:30.364
<v Speaker 2>It's a fraud.</v>

359
00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:31.270
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

360
00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:34.530
<v Speaker 2>You think the faculty should be fighting the administration,</v>

361
00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.660
<v Speaker 2>federal in federal regulation of,</v>

362
00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:40.870
<v Speaker 2>of you know how we're supposed to behave on camp?</v>

363
00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:41.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

364
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:46.310
<v Speaker 1>how can you be so how can you be so naive and foolish to think that taking on an</v>

365
00:09:47.381 --> 00:09:48.970
<v Speaker 1>organization like the university,</v>

366
00:09:48.971 --> 00:09:53.971
<v Speaker 1>which already has plenty to do and you sing it to become a pseudo legal system</v>

367
00:09:55.991 --> 00:09:58.000
<v Speaker 1>that parallels the legal system,</v>

368
00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:01.360
<v Speaker 1>could possibly be anything but utterly catastrophic.</v>

369
00:10:01.361 --> 00:10:04.630
<v Speaker 1>It would mean you'd have to know absolutely nothing about the legal system and</v>

370
00:10:04.631 --> 00:10:09.631
<v Speaker 1>about the tremendous period of evolution that produced what's actually a stellar</v>

371
00:10:09.641 --> 00:10:13.780
<v Speaker 1>system and an adversarial system that protects the rights of the accused and of</v>

372
00:10:13.781 --> 00:10:15.220
<v Speaker 1>the end of the victim.</v>

373
00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:20.110
<v Speaker 1>And to replace that with an ad hoc bureaucracy that has pretty much essentially</v>

374
00:10:20.111 --> 00:10:23.200
<v Speaker 1>the same degree of power as the court system with absolutely none of the</v>

375
00:10:23.201 --> 00:10:24.490
<v Speaker 1>training and none of the guarantees.</v>

376
00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:24.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

377
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:26.470
<v Speaker 2>And won't get real cards or kangaroo.</v>

378
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.110
<v Speaker 2>That piece that I wrote about date rape,</v>

379
00:10:29.111 --> 00:10:31.300
<v Speaker 2>it was in January,</v>

380
00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:32.270
<v Speaker 2>1991 a news day.</v>

381
00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:32.840
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

382
00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.410
<v Speaker 2>whether the most controversial thing I ever wrote in my entire career,</v>

383
00:10:35.411 --> 00:10:36.610
<v Speaker 2>I attack the entire thing.</v>

384
00:10:36.611 --> 00:10:40.090
<v Speaker 2>And I demand of the college's standing back and get out of the social wise with</v>

385
00:10:40.091 --> 00:10:40.750
<v Speaker 2>the students.</v>

386
00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:42.440
<v Speaker 2>So on and and people that will,</v>

387
00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:45.520
<v Speaker 2>the abreaction people tried to recall it and they called the president of the,</v>

388
00:10:45.521 --> 00:10:47.770
<v Speaker 2>my university tried to get me fired.</v>

389
00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.090
<v Speaker 2>You can believe the hysteria.</v>

390
00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:49.520
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

391
00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:49.810
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

392
00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:50.581
<v Speaker 2>I can believe it.</v>

393
00:10:50.581 --> 00:10:50.721
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

394
00:10:50.721 --> 00:10:50.941
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

395
00:10:50.941 --> 00:10:51.120
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

396
00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:51.953
<v Speaker 2>It won't cost them</v>

397
00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:55.820
<v Speaker 2>anything and it went,</v>

398
00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:58.120
<v Speaker 2>if anything that says to women,</v>

399
00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:58.630
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

400
00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:03.630
<v Speaker 2>but they should be responsible for their own choices is regarded as reactionary.</v>

401
00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:05.770
<v Speaker 2>Are they kidding me?</v>

402
00:11:05.771 --> 00:11:06.280
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

403
00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:09.070
<v Speaker 2>This is such a betrayal of authentic feminism in my view.</v>

404
00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:10.061
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

405
00:11:10.061 --> 00:11:12.970
<v Speaker 1>it's the ultimate betrayal of authentic feminism because it's,</v>

406
00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:18.310
<v Speaker 1>it's an invitation of all the things that you might be paranoid about with</v>

407
00:11:18.311 --> 00:11:20.560
<v Speaker 1>regards to the patriarchy back into your life.</v>

408
00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:20.950
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

409
00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:25.540
<v Speaker 1>It's an insistence that the most intrusive part of the tie radical king come and</v>

410
00:11:25.541 --> 00:11:28.810
<v Speaker 1>take control over the most intimate details of your life.</v>

411
00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:29.673
<v Speaker 1>Incredible.</v>

412
00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:30.580
<v Speaker 1>Incredible.</v>

413
00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:34.030
<v Speaker 1>On the assumption is that that's going to make your life better rather than</v>

414
00:11:34.031 --> 00:11:34.480
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>

415
00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:34.930
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

416
00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:35.930
<v Speaker 2>In that dimension,</v>

417
00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:36.830
<v Speaker 2>this idea of,</v>

418
00:11:36.831 --> 00:11:36.981
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

419
00:11:36.981 --> 00:11:38.570
<v Speaker 2>this is the stages of verbal consent.</v>

420
00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.110
<v Speaker 2>As if,</v>

421
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:41.690
<v Speaker 2>as if your impulse is based in the body,</v>

422
00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:43.340
<v Speaker 2>have anything to do with word,</v>

423
00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:44.650
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

424
00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:45.680
<v Speaker 2>That's the whole point is,</v>

425
00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:45.831
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

426
00:11:45.831 --> 00:11:47.860
<v Speaker 2>you're allowed the case to abandon,</v>

427
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:48.081
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

428
00:11:48.081 --> 00:11:52.280
<v Speaker 2>That you know that part of the brain that's so it traveled with words.</v>

429
00:11:52.281 --> 00:11:53.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>

430
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:54.070
<v Speaker 2>you see</v>

431
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:58.540
<v Speaker 1>these two actually a marker of lack of social ability to have to do that.</v>

432
00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:00.130
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're a sophisticated,</v>

433
00:12:00.131 --> 00:12:01.960
<v Speaker 1>it's normally like if you're dancing with someone,</v>

434
00:12:01.961 --> 00:12:04.000
<v Speaker 1>it's not like you call out the moves,</v>

435
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:04.660
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

436
00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:05.680
<v Speaker 1>If you have to do that,</v>

437
00:12:05.681 --> 00:12:06.514
<v Speaker 1>well then you're,</v>

438
00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:06.911
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

439
00:12:06.911 --> 00:12:07.241
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

440
00:12:07.241 --> 00:12:09.260
<v Speaker 1>you're more worse than a neophyte,</v>

441
00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:09.581
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

442
00:12:09.581 --> 00:12:13.300
<v Speaker 1>You're an awkward Neil fight and anybody with any sense should get the hell away</v>

443
00:12:13.301 --> 00:12:14.050
<v Speaker 1>from you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>But what I want an unbelievably,</v>

449
00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:26.200
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>
