1
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.250
<v Speaker 1>Would it hurt to define of what a religious experiences in this case then?</v>

2
00:00:10.251 --> 00:00:12.330
<v Speaker 1>Because I feel like the semantics of like,</v>

3
00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if what you're saying about a religious experience is what I'm</v>

4
00:00:15.711 --> 00:00:16.580
<v Speaker 1>understanding.</v>

5
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:17.851
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6
00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:22.560
<v Speaker 1>generally a religious experience is something like an experience of the,</v>

7
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.300
<v Speaker 1>of the renewal of the world.</v>

8
00:00:24.301 --> 00:00:25.430
<v Speaker 1>That might be one way of,</v>

9
00:00:25.431 --> 00:00:30.120
<v Speaker 1>of thinking about it so that everything's sort of leaps forward as crystal clean</v>

10
00:00:30.121 --> 00:00:34.980
<v Speaker 1>and perfect as if you had been viewing it from behind the mask before.</v>

11
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.060
<v Speaker 1>Another would be a sense of the Union of everything.</v>

12
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.950
<v Speaker 1>And so you're a singular being and you're isolated and in religious experiences.</v>

13
00:00:43.951 --> 00:00:44.641
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

14
00:00:44.641 --> 00:00:47.520
<v Speaker 1>there's a book written recently by a neuroscientist,</v>

15
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

16
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.950
<v Speaker 1>my stroke of,</v>

17
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.523
<v Speaker 1>what's it called?</v>

18
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.720
<v Speaker 1>My stroke of insight.</v>

19
00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:54.961
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

20
00:00:54.961 --> 00:00:55.471
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

21
00:00:55.471 --> 00:00:58.920
<v Speaker 1>And I believe she had a left hemisphere stroke,</v>

22
00:00:58.921 --> 00:01:00.180
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly.</v>

23
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.920
<v Speaker 1>And she was</v>

24
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.800
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently well developed neuroscientists to understand what was happening as</v>

25
00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:08.820
<v Speaker 1>she had the stroke.</v>

26
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.900
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

27
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.700
<v Speaker 1>and she had a intense religious experience as a consequence of that.</v>

28
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.060
<v Speaker 1>And she experienced it as a dissolution of the ego into this state of union with</v>

29
00:01:20.311 --> 00:01:20.911
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

30
00:01:20.911 --> 00:01:25.230
<v Speaker 1>And this transcendent experience of awe and and the,</v>

31
00:01:25.231 --> 00:01:27.510
<v Speaker 1>oh well I don't remember the rest of it.</v>

32
00:01:27.511 --> 00:01:30.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are other elements of religious experience that are quite common.</v>

33
00:01:30.571 --> 00:01:32.400
<v Speaker 1>The idea of the opening of the heavens,</v>

34
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.443
<v Speaker 1>that's one.</v>

35
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.250
<v Speaker 1>The communion with the ancestors,</v>

36
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.000
<v Speaker 1>that's another the reduction of the body to a skeleton,</v>

37
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.670
<v Speaker 1>that's another the movement up into heaven there.</v>

38
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.440
<v Speaker 1>These are well documented phenomena and a lot of them are associated.</v>

39
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.890
<v Speaker 1>While a fair number of them are associated with psychedelic use,</v>

40
00:01:49.891 --> 00:01:54.540
<v Speaker 1>but that's not the only avenue to experiences like that and epilepsy can produce</v>

41
00:01:54.541 --> 00:01:59.160
<v Speaker 1>experiences like that too and people usually report near death experiences as</v>

42
00:01:59.161 --> 00:01:59.560
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

43
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.091
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

44
00:02:00.091 --> 00:02:04.890
<v Speaker 1>people usually report that those experiences have life altering significance.</v>

45
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.250
<v Speaker 1>Now that in and of itself only proves that people are capable of having</v>

46
00:02:10.531 --> 00:02:12.420
<v Speaker 1>subjective religious experiences.</v>

47
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.343
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

48
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.700
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't definitively proved that there's anything outside of that.</v>

49
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.740
<v Speaker 1>So Young Carl Young for example,</v>

50
00:02:19.741 --> 00:02:22.140
<v Speaker 1>most of the time he didn't talk about God.</v>

51
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.510
<v Speaker 1>He talked about the God image,</v>

52
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.650
<v Speaker 1>which is not the same thing because you could have a god image that was even</v>

53
00:02:28.651 --> 00:02:33.651
<v Speaker 1>evolutionarily instantiated without that necessarily being rep related to any</v>

54
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.440
<v Speaker 1>transcendent being beyond the image.</v>

55
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.303
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

56
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.560
<v Speaker 1>So who knows,</v>

57
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.513
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>

58
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:42.773
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

59
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:43.261
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

60
00:02:43.261 --> 00:02:47.370
<v Speaker 1>I think it depends on what you're willing to accept as proof.</v>

61
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:48.630
<v Speaker 1>Now the proof,</v>

62
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.870
<v Speaker 1>the it's beyond question that could,</v>

63
00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:54.720
<v Speaker 1>people can have life changing religious experiences.</v>

64
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.440
<v Speaker 1>Another example of that is that the best treatment for alcoholism is religious</v>

65
00:02:59.441 --> 00:03:00.274
<v Speaker 1>conversion.</v>

66
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.210
<v Speaker 1>It's well documented in the literature and I studied alcoholism for a long time.</v>

67
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.450
<v Speaker 1>So one of the cures that sticks is religious conversion and the 12 step programs</v>

68
00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:13.180
<v Speaker 1>essentially attempt to instantiate religious conversion.</v>

69
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.570
<v Speaker 1>And it's hard to document their success because they succeed for the people who</v>

70
00:03:18.641 --> 00:03:19.510
<v Speaker 1>stick with it.</v>

71
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.880
<v Speaker 1>But that's not a very good measure.</v>

72
00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:22.121
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

73
00:03:22.121 --> 00:03:22.954
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of,</v>

74
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.220
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of self evident that they work for the people who stick with it.</v>

75
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm not cynical about about alcoholics anonymous or anything,</v>

76
00:03:30.761 --> 00:03:32.200
<v Speaker 1>but we don't have good data on,</v>

77
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.070
<v Speaker 1>on outcome.</v>

78
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.730
<v Speaker 1>But there is good data showing that religious transformation is a good cure for</v>

79
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.873
<v Speaker 1>alcoholism.</v>

80
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.140
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

81
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.030
<v Speaker 1>and that's an interesting phenomena to um,</v>

82
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.470
<v Speaker 1>it's too complicated.</v>

83
00:03:50.471 --> 00:03:51.304
<v Speaker 1>They're probably can't.</v>

84
00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.601
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

85
00:03:54.601 --> 00:03:54.961
<v Speaker 1>I'll try.</v>

86
00:03:54.961 --> 00:03:56.220
<v Speaker 1>I'll try this for a second.</v>

87
00:03:56.221 --> 00:03:58.710
<v Speaker 1>So here's how I think a religious conversion might work.</v>

88
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.680
<v Speaker 1>So imagine you've got the left hemisphere and it's,</v>

89
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.770
<v Speaker 1>it's the place where your habitual interpretations reside.</v>

90
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.550
<v Speaker 1>So I can give you a quick example of this.</v>

91
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.260
<v Speaker 1>So this Guy Arama Shawn Ryan,</v>

92
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.760
<v Speaker 1>who's a neuro physiologist or a,</v>

93
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.633
<v Speaker 1>I think that's his,</v>

94
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.900
<v Speaker 1>that's his field of study.</v>

95
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.670
<v Speaker 1>I think he's at Ucla.</v>

96
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.160
<v Speaker 1>He studied people who had neglect.</v>

97
00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:22.200
<v Speaker 1>And neglect is a very,</v>

98
00:04:22.201 --> 00:04:23.310
<v Speaker 1>very bizarre phenomenon.</v>

99
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.640
<v Speaker 1>So if you have a stroke that damages your right parietal lobe,</v>

100
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.820
<v Speaker 1>you'll lose the left part of your being,</v>

101
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.080
<v Speaker 1>not just your body.</v>

102
00:04:31.081 --> 00:04:32.040
<v Speaker 1>It's really weird.</v>

103
00:04:32.041 --> 00:04:32.580
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

104
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:33.361
<v Speaker 1>so for example,</v>

105
00:04:33.361 --> 00:04:37.590
<v Speaker 1>if you have a right parietal stroke and you look at a clock,</v>

106
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.420
<v Speaker 1>you only see you only,</v>

107
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.460
<v Speaker 1>only half the clock exists for you.</v>

108
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.830
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you only see half the clock.</v>

109
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:44.820
<v Speaker 1>It's weirder than that.</v>

110
00:04:44.821 --> 00:04:47.910
<v Speaker 1>It's that there's only the right side of the clock.</v>

111
00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.560
<v Speaker 1>There's only the right side of you.</v>

112
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.480
<v Speaker 1>There's only the right side of my body.</v>

113
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that this exists.</v>

114
00:04:53.611 --> 00:04:56.340
<v Speaker 1>And so sometimes people with right parietal damage,</v>

115
00:04:56.341 --> 00:04:56.620
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>

116
00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.900
<v Speaker 1>we'll wake up after the stroke and grabbed their left arm and throw it out of</v>

117
00:05:00.901 --> 00:05:04.200
<v Speaker 1>bed and or their leg and throw it out of bed because it's not theirs.</v>

118
00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.820
<v Speaker 1>And then of course they fall out of bed,</v>

119
00:05:05.821 --> 00:05:06.990
<v Speaker 1>which is quite a shock to them.</v>

120
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.390
<v Speaker 1>So and so,</v>

121
00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.820
<v Speaker 1>and they'll only eat half the food on the plate.</v>

122
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.520
<v Speaker 1>Nobody can really understand this phenomenal logically,</v>

123
00:05:14.521 --> 00:05:14.761
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

124
00:05:14.761 --> 00:05:17.280
<v Speaker 1>Because we can't Magine what that must be like.</v>

125
00:05:17.281 --> 00:05:18.420
<v Speaker 1>I think it must be like,</v>

126
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.390
<v Speaker 1>you know how you know there's things behind you,</v>

127
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.610
<v Speaker 1>but you don't not see them.</v>

128
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:24.870
<v Speaker 1>They're just not there.</v>

129
00:05:24.871 --> 00:05:26.520
<v Speaker 1>It's not like it's black or anything,</v>

130
00:05:26.521 --> 00:05:27.540
<v Speaker 1>or there's a space,</v>

131
00:05:27.541 --> 00:05:29.340
<v Speaker 1>it's just not there.</v>

132
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:34.620
<v Speaker 1>And so I think what happens is the not there extends to three quarters of the</v>

133
00:05:34.621 --> 00:05:36.270
<v Speaker 1>field instead of half the field.</v>

134
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:37.860
<v Speaker 1>That's a guess.</v>

135
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.401
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

136
00:05:38.401 --> 00:05:40.110
<v Speaker 1>so Ramesh,</v>

137
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.411
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

138
00:05:40.411 --> 00:05:43.650
<v Speaker 1>the funny thing about people with neglect is that if you tell them,</v>

139
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:44.910
<v Speaker 1>if you point it out,</v>

140
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:45.361
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

141
00:05:45.361 --> 00:05:45.571
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

142
00:05:45.571 --> 00:05:48.540
<v Speaker 1>I noticed that you're not moving your left foot today.</v>

143
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:49.291
<v Speaker 1>They'll say,</v>

144
00:05:49.291 --> 00:05:49.740
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

145
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:50.280
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

146
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.150
<v Speaker 1>it's arthritic.</v>

147
00:05:51.151 --> 00:05:53.160
<v Speaker 1>And I can't move it and say,</v>

148
00:05:53.161 --> 00:05:53.311
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

149
00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:54.270
<v Speaker 1>why don't you just try to move it?</v>

150
00:05:54.271 --> 00:05:54.541
<v Speaker 1>So no,</v>

151
00:05:54.541 --> 00:05:54.811
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

152
00:05:54.811 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 1>doctor already told you it's in too much pain to move it working fine this</v>

153
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.220
<v Speaker 1>morning and that can be months after the the accident.</v>

154
00:06:01.221 --> 00:06:06.221
<v Speaker 1>So it's a denial and people thought actually that that was trauma induced denial</v>

155
00:06:06.261 --> 00:06:09.020
<v Speaker 1>for a long time before they figured it out was actually a consequence of the</v>

156
00:06:09.021 --> 00:06:10.490
<v Speaker 1>neurophysiological damage.</v>

157
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.820
<v Speaker 1>Now Rama Shondra and found that if you irrigated the contralateral ear,</v>

158
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.860
<v Speaker 1>say now if you pour cold water in someone's ear,</v>

159
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.520
<v Speaker 1>it upsets their vestibular system and their eyes will move back and forth like</v>

160
00:06:25.521 --> 00:06:26.330
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

161
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.160
<v Speaker 1>You can try that at a party if you want.</v>

162
00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:29.303
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

163
00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.110
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>

164
00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.150
<v Speaker 1>Ramachandran was testing vestibular function on these patients and he irrigated</v>

165
00:06:35.151 --> 00:06:38.810
<v Speaker 1>the right ear with cold water and they woke up.</v>

166
00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.830
<v Speaker 1>And maybe what happened was that that was shocking enough.</v>

167
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:47.630
<v Speaker 1>So imagine the networks in the right hemisphere were degraded but not completely</v>

168
00:06:47.631 --> 00:06:51.830
<v Speaker 1>gone and they needed a really high threshold of activation to snap into</v>

169
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:52.610
<v Speaker 1>function.</v>

170
00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:53.810
<v Speaker 1>So here's an example of that.</v>

171
00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.940
<v Speaker 1>If you have Parkinson's disease managing,</v>

172
00:06:55.941 --> 00:06:56.870
<v Speaker 1>you're frozen there.</v>

173
00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:57.740
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

174
00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:58.880
<v Speaker 1>And I throw a ball at you,</v>

175
00:06:58.881 --> 00:07:00.710
<v Speaker 1>you'll go like this and catch it,</v>

176
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:02.990
<v Speaker 1>but you can't throw it back.</v>

177
00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:04.640
<v Speaker 1>So you can,</v>

178
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:06.260
<v Speaker 1>the stimulus is enough.</v>

179
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.720
<v Speaker 1>That's enough to push you past threshold.</v>

180
00:07:08.721 --> 00:07:10.220
<v Speaker 1>But you can't do it voluntarily.</v>

181
00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.390
<v Speaker 1>Now if you have Parkinson's,</v>

182
00:07:11.391 --> 00:07:13.460
<v Speaker 1>like right to the nth degree,</v>

183
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:14.750
<v Speaker 1>you won't even be able to catch it.</v>

184
00:07:14.751 --> 00:07:16.880
<v Speaker 1>But there's a stage where you could still do that.</v>

185
00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:21.320
<v Speaker 1>There's a great case study where this grandpa was in a wheelchair,</v>

186
00:07:21.321 --> 00:07:25.460
<v Speaker 1>he had Parkinson's and his young grandson was playing out on the dock and fell</v>

187
00:07:25.461 --> 00:07:28.760
<v Speaker 1>in the water and started to drown and he got out of his wheelchair,</v>

188
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:30.560
<v Speaker 1>went into the ocean,</v>

189
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:31.610
<v Speaker 1>rescued him,</v>

190
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:33.080
<v Speaker 1>brought him onto the beach,</v>

191
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:36.200
<v Speaker 1>sat back down in his wheelchair and was paralyzed again.</v>

192
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:37.281
<v Speaker 1>So that was enough.</v>

193
00:07:37.281 --> 00:07:39.710
<v Speaker 1>So you can imagine there was enough network left.</v>

194
00:07:39.711 --> 00:07:44.711
<v Speaker 1>So if the emotional tension became high enough that the degraded circuits could</v>

195
00:07:45.051 --> 00:07:45.890
<v Speaker 1>still function.</v>

196
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:47.000
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

197
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:47.301
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

198
00:07:47.301 --> 00:07:49.850
<v Speaker 1>so back to remise Shondra so you irrigate the year,</v>

199
00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:53.470
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden the right hemisphere connections flash,</v>

200
00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:56.810
<v Speaker 1>the remainders managed to connect and the person goes,</v>

201
00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:57.531
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

202
00:07:57.531 --> 00:07:58.670
<v Speaker 1>I've had a terrible stroke.</v>

203
00:07:58.671 --> 00:08:00.260
<v Speaker 1>I've lost the left side of my body.</v>

204
00:08:00.261 --> 00:08:01.370
<v Speaker 1>They're crying.</v>

205
00:08:01.371 --> 00:08:03.620
<v Speaker 1>They're like completely catastrophic.</v>

206
00:08:03.621 --> 00:08:05.000
<v Speaker 1>Lee overwhelmed by it.</v>

207
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:09.680
<v Speaker 1>And then 20 minutes later the they effects wear off and they snap back in and</v>

208
00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.113
<v Speaker 1>now they,</v>

209
00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.590
<v Speaker 1>they've lost her left side again.</v>

210
00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:13.430
<v Speaker 1>They don't remember it.</v>

211
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:18.820
<v Speaker 1>And so what seems to happen is that the right hemisphere is collecting a</v>

212
00:08:20.301 --> 00:08:21.680
<v Speaker 1>normalist information.</v>

213
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:22.910
<v Speaker 1>That's what it does.</v>

214
00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.560
<v Speaker 1>That's what it does when you're dreaming,</v>

215
00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:25.011
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

216
00:08:25.011 --> 00:08:25.251
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

217
00:08:25.251 --> 00:08:26.084
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

218
00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:31.240
<v Speaker 1>it's representing that anomalous information in image form and sort of slowly</v>

219
00:08:31.491 --> 00:08:34.730
<v Speaker 1>passing it to the left hemisphere so it doesn't overwhelm it.</v>

220
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:36.530
<v Speaker 1>And maybe if it gets overwhelming,</v>

221
00:08:36.531 --> 00:08:39.800
<v Speaker 1>you wake up and you're afraid and you tell someone about the dream that helps</v>

222
00:08:39.801 --> 00:08:40.940
<v Speaker 1>you figure out what it was.</v>

223
00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:41.983
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

224
00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:46.400
<v Speaker 1>so that the right hemisphere is always trying to tap the left hemisphere into</v>

225
00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:47.900
<v Speaker 1>transformation,</v>

226
00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:49.003
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

227
00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:53.900
<v Speaker 1>So now imagine that that can happen a little bit or a lot.</v>

228
00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:57.600
<v Speaker 1>So maybe you're just ignoring a little bit of anomalous information.</v>

229
00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:00.720
<v Speaker 1>You just have some mildly frightening dreams.</v>

230
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:04.080
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe you've just stacked up a whole bunch of things that you're ignoring.</v>

231
00:09:04.081 --> 00:09:08.310
<v Speaker 1>And there's some major league monsters that you haven't contended with.</v>

232
00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:13.370
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's situations where the right hemisphere is stored up enough counter</v>

233
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.400
<v Speaker 1>enough of a counter hypothesis,</v>

234
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:17.971
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

235
00:09:17.971 --> 00:09:20.760
<v Speaker 1>about how the world works make making sense.</v>

236
00:09:20.761 --> 00:09:25.761
<v Speaker 1>Out of all those things that you've ignored that one day it just goes snap and</v>

237
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:30.840
<v Speaker 1>you're a new personality and maybe the new personality isn't addicted.</v>

238
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:34.590
<v Speaker 1>So it's something like it's something like that.</v>

239
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:35.880
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
