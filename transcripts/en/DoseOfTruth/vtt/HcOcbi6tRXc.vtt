00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.460
<v Speaker 1>Wesley yang reported that you met with Tech Titans,</v>

2
00:00:10.461 --> 00:00:12.140
<v Speaker 1>Marc Andreessen and Peter Teal,</v>

3
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.110
<v Speaker 1>both of whom advocate decentralized education.</v>

4
00:00:15.111 --> 00:00:16.670
<v Speaker 1>Can you share anything about this?</v>

5
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.133
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

6
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I can share anything interesting.</v>

7
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:21.261
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

8
00:00:21.261 --> 00:00:23.210
<v Speaker 1>I enjoyed the meeting mark and Peter.</v>

9
00:00:23.211 --> 00:00:24.650
<v Speaker 1>I met mark several times.</v>

10
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:25.310
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

11
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.510
<v Speaker 1>I've only met Peter Wants,</v>

12
00:00:26.511 --> 00:00:30.140
<v Speaker 1>although I've spent some time with Eric Weinstein who works with Peter,</v>

13
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:31.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.740
<v Speaker 1>Peter is Libertarian oriented.</v>

15
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.993
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

16
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.103
<v Speaker 1>and so</v>

17
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.650
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

18
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:38.220
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

19
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.220
<v Speaker 1>he shares concerns about the potential totalitarian function of Internet</v>

20
00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:48.440
<v Speaker 1>technology and manifesting itself well in,</v>

21
00:00:48.441 --> 00:00:52.110
<v Speaker 1>in the constant monitoring of our behavior and also in,</v>

22
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:54.930
<v Speaker 1>in the emergent censorship.</v>

23
00:00:54.931 --> 00:00:57.030
<v Speaker 1>Let's say Marc Andreessen,</v>

24
00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.730
<v Speaker 1>well Mark's a smart guy and he knows a lot of other smart guys and we,</v>

25
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.840
<v Speaker 1>we spent a lot of time talking about the possibility of online education and,</v>

26
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.610
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

27
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.920
<v Speaker 1>but there isn't anything really exciting I can report about that.</v>

28
00:01:10.921 --> 00:01:15.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean they were all preliminary discussions of a sort to see if we could get</v>

29
00:01:15.061 --> 00:01:16.170
<v Speaker 1>long and if we could talk.</v>

30
00:01:16.171 --> 00:01:17.670
<v Speaker 1>And so far we've been able to,</v>

31
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.030
<v Speaker 1>I am making a fair bit of headway with this university project,</v>

32
00:01:23.251 --> 00:01:26.580
<v Speaker 1>although we don't really conceptualize it as a university project anymore.</v>

33
00:01:26.581 --> 00:01:31.581
<v Speaker 1>We're conceptualizing it as an adaptive learning system and we're trying to use</v>

34
00:01:32.431 --> 00:01:37.431
<v Speaker 1>it to index people's no index knowledge on the web funnel money to creative</v>

35
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.140
<v Speaker 1>producers of educational content,</v>

36
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.250
<v Speaker 1>allow people to test their knowledge no matter how it's generated and to</v>

37
00:01:44.251 --> 00:01:45.600
<v Speaker 1>accredit people properly.</v>

38
00:01:45.601 --> 00:01:46.890
<v Speaker 1>And we'll release,</v>

39
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.030
<v Speaker 1>release more information about that in the upcoming months as we move closer and</v>

40
00:01:51.031 --> 00:01:52.560
<v Speaker 1>closer to a functional prototype.</v>

41
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:53.850
<v Speaker 1>The plan at the moment,</v>

42
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.250
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to lots of people like Andrea said,</v>

43
00:01:56.251 --> 00:01:57.540
<v Speaker 1>and teal who,</v>

44
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.770
<v Speaker 1>who are very interested in technology and education and who also are very well</v>

45
00:02:01.771 --> 00:02:06.570
<v Speaker 1>capitalized and have had the opportunity multiple times to pull in investors</v>

46
00:02:06.571 --> 00:02:08.190
<v Speaker 1>into this educational project.</v>

47
00:02:08.191 --> 00:02:11.550
<v Speaker 1>But I haven't done that partly because weirdly enough,</v>

48
00:02:11.551 --> 00:02:12.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.430
<v Speaker 1>you think money is a solution to a problem,</v>

50
00:02:14.431 --> 00:02:15.264
<v Speaker 1>but it's also,</v>

51
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.370
<v Speaker 1>it's often a problem in and of itself.</v>

52
00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:19.980
<v Speaker 1>And if I generated several million dollars,</v>

53
00:02:19.981 --> 00:02:20.341
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

54
00:02:20.341 --> 00:02:22.200
<v Speaker 1>to fund this educational,</v>

55
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.383
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

56
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.790
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

57
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:24.623
<v Speaker 1>endeavor,</v>

58
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.140
<v Speaker 1>then I would not only have to worry about how to design the educational system,</v>

59
00:02:28.141 --> 00:02:31.470
<v Speaker 1>but then I'd have to worry about how to spend that money and shepherd that money</v>

60
00:02:31.471 --> 00:02:32.370
<v Speaker 1>intelligently.</v>

61
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.110
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually a huge administrative problem of sufficient magnitude to</v>

62
00:02:37.111 --> 00:02:39.510
<v Speaker 1>stop you from doing any creative thinking at all.</v>

63
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.490
<v Speaker 1>So what we're doing instead is I'm funding the university project at the moment</v>

64
00:02:44.491 --> 00:02:49.491
<v Speaker 1>or the online education project as a consequence of my patriot and funding car.</v>

65
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.710
<v Speaker 1>Fixed that in about five seconds this time.</v>

66
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.710
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

67
00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:54.543
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

68
00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.210
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

69
00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm finding that from my Patriot patrion donations and I like that better.</v>

70
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.150
<v Speaker 1>The only problem is,</v>

71
00:03:01.151 --> 00:03:04.600
<v Speaker 1>is that I would like to offer the people that I have his employees a certain</v>

72
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:06.070
<v Speaker 1>amount of financial stability.</v>

73
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.200
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

74
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.871
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

75
00:03:07.871 --> 00:03:10.990
<v Speaker 1>it isn't obvious to me how stable the Patriot on funding is,</v>

76
00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:12.700
<v Speaker 1>although it's been very stable so far.</v>

77
00:03:12.701 --> 00:03:13.301
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

78
00:03:13.301 --> 00:03:14.950
<v Speaker 1>who knows how that will work out.</v>

79
00:03:14.951 --> 00:03:19.951
<v Speaker 1>So I think what we're going to do is to crowd fund in October or November once</v>

80
00:03:21.311 --> 00:03:23.590
<v Speaker 1>we have a minimal viable product.</v>

81
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.180
<v Speaker 1>And I think I'd rather do that than raise money privately anyways because I</v>

82
00:03:28.181 --> 00:03:31.630
<v Speaker 1>don't want this project to be beholden to anyone.</v>

83
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.790
<v Speaker 1>And I wanted to maintain control over its direction with a small group of</v>

84
00:03:36.791 --> 00:03:37.480
<v Speaker 1>programmers.</v>

85
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.751
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

86
00:03:37.751 --> 00:03:41.200
<v Speaker 1>it's often a small group of people who are working tightly together that solve</v>

87
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:42.520
<v Speaker 1>very complicated problems.</v>

88
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.470
<v Speaker 1>And that's certainly been the case with working.</v>

89
00:03:44.471 --> 00:03:48.460
<v Speaker 1>Say with Daniel Higgins and Robert Peel on the self authoring programs and so</v>

90
00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:49.090
<v Speaker 1>forth.</v>

91
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.930
<v Speaker 1>Small team.</v>

92
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:50.591
<v Speaker 1>We've,</v>

93
00:03:50.591 --> 00:03:54.190
<v Speaker 1>we've thought about going the venture capital route and expanding and trying to</v>

94
00:03:54.191 --> 00:03:55.360
<v Speaker 1>make a big business out of it.</v>

95
00:03:55.361 --> 00:03:57.070
<v Speaker 1>But our sense was more that,</v>

96
00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:58.990
<v Speaker 1>and maybe we were wrong about this,</v>

97
00:03:58.991 --> 00:04:02.830
<v Speaker 1>but that was better to go directly after customers and to build the business</v>

98
00:04:02.831 --> 00:04:07.831
<v Speaker 1>incrementally and to test it along each step and not to get enticed by the</v>

99
00:04:08.021 --> 00:04:10.120
<v Speaker 1>possibility of Unicorn level money.</v>

100
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.883
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

101
00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.820
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

102
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:13.653
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>

103
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.980
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>

104
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.210
<v Speaker 1>that's the situation there.</v>

105
00:04:16.211 --> 00:04:19.060
<v Speaker 1>And I've got three really bright people working on this,</v>

106
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:20.303
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

107
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.790
<v Speaker 1>open educational platform and it's really quite exciting.</v>

108
00:04:24.791 --> 00:04:25.431
<v Speaker 1>And I would say we're,</v>

109
00:04:25.431 --> 00:04:28.480
<v Speaker 1>we're well ahead of schedule from where I thought we would be.</v>

110
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.310
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty cool.</v>

111
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.720
<v Speaker 1>Have you spoken to Nassim to lab following your brief Twitter exchange?</v>

112
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.760
<v Speaker 1>We'd love to hear a conversation with the two of you.</v>

113
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.620
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to talk to him too because he's very,</v>

114
00:04:38.621 --> 00:04:39.340
<v Speaker 1>very smart.</v>

115
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.090
<v Speaker 1>He's a,</v>

116
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.690
<v Speaker 1>he's touchy though and so I have some apprehension about that.</v>

117
00:04:43.691 --> 00:04:43.880
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

118
00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.500
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to lots of touchy people over the last couple of years and I'm a bit</v>

119
00:04:47.501 --> 00:04:48.340
<v Speaker 1>apprehensive about it,</v>

120
00:04:48.341 --> 00:04:49.390
<v Speaker 1>but I would like to do that.</v>

121
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.430
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people I'd like to talk to.</v>

122
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.160
<v Speaker 1>He's one of them and you know,</v>

123
00:04:54.161 --> 00:04:54.610
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

124
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm having a hard time setting up those conversations at the moment because I'm</v>

125
00:04:57.671 --> 00:04:58.690
<v Speaker 1>doing so much touring.</v>

126
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.490
<v Speaker 1>I am talking again to Jonathan Heit though in the near future and I think</v>

127
00:05:03.491 --> 00:05:05.680
<v Speaker 1>probably to Steven pinker as well.</v>

128
00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:06.791
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

129
00:05:06.791 --> 00:05:08.410
<v Speaker 1>for those of you who are wondering,</v>

130
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.513
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

131
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.710
<v Speaker 1>I am going to release the,</v>

132
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:13.210
<v Speaker 1>and so is Sam.</v>

133
00:05:13.211 --> 00:05:18.211
<v Speaker 1>We're going to release the videos from the Sam Harris Peterson debates.</v>

134
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

135
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.250
<v Speaker 1>I'll put them on my youtube channel.</v>

136
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.571
<v Speaker 1>Sam,</v>

137
00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:22.600
<v Speaker 1>we'll put them on his will,</v>

138
00:05:22.601 --> 00:05:24.280
<v Speaker 1>make them into podcasts as well.</v>

139
00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to release the first one on September 1st and uh,</v>

140
00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.760
<v Speaker 1>and everyone will have access to it.</v>

141
00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:31.420
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

142
00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.240
<v Speaker 1>it's taken us a while to figure out exactly how to do this,</v>

143
00:05:34.241 --> 00:05:37.840
<v Speaker 1>partly because Travis Pangbourne who hosted the events wanted to raise some</v>

144
00:05:37.841 --> 00:05:39.550
<v Speaker 1>money with the videos,</v>

145
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.460
<v Speaker 1>at least in part to help offset the costs that he incurred for those events,</v>

146
00:05:45.461 --> 00:05:47.080
<v Speaker 1>which were very expensive,</v>

147
00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.951
<v Speaker 1>believe it or not,</v>

148
00:05:47.951 --> 00:05:51.700
<v Speaker 1>and difficult to generate a profit for from on his end.</v>

149
00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:53.003
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

150
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:58.170
<v Speaker 1>and also he wants to translate the material that he already has into multiple</v>

151
00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:00.741
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>

152
00:06:00.741 --> 00:06:03.370
<v Speaker 1>So we agreed to let him win.</v>

153
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.180
<v Speaker 1>We had to make a three way agreement for this,</v>

154
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:05.391
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

155
00:06:05.391 --> 00:06:07.430
<v Speaker 1>because Sam was involved and I was involved in,</v>

156
00:06:07.431 --> 00:06:08.750
<v Speaker 1>so it was Pangbourne and so,</v>

157
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.090
<v Speaker 1>and we didn't know how the events would go,</v>

158
00:06:11.091 --> 00:06:11.421
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

159
00:06:11.421 --> 00:06:14.810
<v Speaker 1>so we weren't actually that concerned with the damn videos to begin with because</v>

160
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.681
<v Speaker 1>we take,</v>

161
00:06:15.681 --> 00:06:16.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

162
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.670
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

163
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:17.250
<v Speaker 1>we'd take an,</v>

164
00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:17.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

165
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.553
<v Speaker 1>a risk,</v>

166
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm not complaining about this by the way,</v>

167
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:21.810
<v Speaker 1>like I'm not complaining about taking risks,</v>

168
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.290
<v Speaker 1>but we didn't salmon,</v>

169
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.410
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't even met,</v>

170
00:06:24.411 --> 00:06:24.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

171
00:06:24.651 --> 00:06:27.290
<v Speaker 1>we didn't know if we were going to have conversations that were worthwhile.</v>

172
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.570
<v Speaker 1>We didn't know if anybody would show up for the events.</v>

173
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.870
<v Speaker 1>And so we were way more concerned about whether or not we'd get a crowd of any</v>

174
00:06:32.871 --> 00:06:33.261
<v Speaker 1>sort,</v>

175
00:06:33.261 --> 00:06:37.040
<v Speaker 1>whether the events would be successful and whether we could actually talk then</v>

176
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.010
<v Speaker 1>what we would do with the videos if the,</v>

177
00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:43.100
<v Speaker 1>or even if there would be videos if the events were successful.</v>

178
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.360
<v Speaker 1>And so it turned out that we couldn't talk and we did have useful discussions.</v>

179
00:06:47.361 --> 00:06:48.470
<v Speaker 1>At least we thought so.</v>

180
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.550
<v Speaker 1>And the audiences responded very well and there was large crowds and so it was</v>

181
00:06:52.551 --> 00:06:53.151
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>

182
00:06:53.151 --> 00:06:55.340
<v Speaker 1>So then it turned out that the videos were worthwhile,</v>

183
00:06:55.341 --> 00:07:00.341
<v Speaker 1>but we hadn't discussed who had control over the videos or who was going to edit</v>

184
00:07:01.221 --> 00:07:02.330
<v Speaker 1>them or any of those things.</v>

185
00:07:02.331 --> 00:07:05.240
<v Speaker 1>And we had to do that post hoc after the fact,</v>

186
00:07:05.241 --> 00:07:06.620
<v Speaker 1>which isn't the best way of doing it.</v>

187
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.690
<v Speaker 1>And then it took Travis a while to assemble a team to do the actual editing.</v>

188
00:07:11.691 --> 00:07:14.030
<v Speaker 1>And so that was our compromise.</v>

189
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.110
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

190
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:18.620
<v Speaker 1>it would've been better if we could have released the videos and all of that</v>

191
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:20.150
<v Speaker 1>immediately after the talks.</v>

192
00:07:20.151 --> 00:07:21.350
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

193
00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:24.920
<v Speaker 1>when you're doing something new and you don't know exactly what you're doing,</v>

194
00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:26.720
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to do it perfectly.</v>

195
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.390
<v Speaker 1>And so we didn't do that perfectly,</v>

196
00:07:29.391 --> 00:07:31.220
<v Speaker 1>but the events were good.</v>

197
00:07:31.221 --> 00:07:34.820
<v Speaker 1>And I enjoyed talking to Sam and I learned a lot from the discussion.</v>

198
00:07:34.821 --> 00:07:36.380
<v Speaker 1>I really had to sharpen my thinking.</v>

199
00:07:36.381 --> 00:07:37.820
<v Speaker 1>I really figured out something,</v>

200
00:07:37.821 --> 00:07:38.091
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

201
00:07:38.091 --> 00:07:43.091
<v Speaker 1>I figured out that I think the fundamental issue here is how you take the</v>

202
00:07:43.251 --> 00:07:46.760
<v Speaker 1>infinite world of facts that presents itself to you,</v>

203
00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:49.820
<v Speaker 1>independent of the value of those facts.</v>

204
00:07:49.821 --> 00:07:54.380
<v Speaker 1>So value neutral facts and they have to be filtered to a single point,</v>

205
00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.950
<v Speaker 1>like a single point of perception because you have to point your eyes at one</v>

206
00:07:57.951 --> 00:08:01.130
<v Speaker 1>thing and your attention at one thing and a single point of action.</v>

207
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:06.430
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a tremendous reducing of the world of fact to the extraordinarily</v>

208
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:11.060
<v Speaker 1>simple and targeted rule of Vail or world of value.</v>

209
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:12.500
<v Speaker 1>And your,</v>

210
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:17.330
<v Speaker 1>your brain is the instrument that does that reducing and it's sort of,</v>

211
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:21.980
<v Speaker 1>it's in keeping with Elvis Huxley's suppositions about that and they were</v>

212
00:08:21.981 --> 00:08:26.981
<v Speaker 1>motivated by Henri Bergson the idea that the brain was a reducing valve and that</v>

213
00:08:27.021 --> 00:08:30.350
<v Speaker 1>what psychedelic experience did was open the doors of perception.</v>

214
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.300
<v Speaker 1>Something William Blake also talked about.</v>

215
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:37.990
<v Speaker 1>The brain seems to be in some sense the part of the structure that reduces the</v>

216
00:08:38.001 --> 00:08:42.950
<v Speaker 1>infinite complexity of the world of facts to the finite and single point domain</v>

217
00:08:42.951 --> 00:08:44.030
<v Speaker 1>of world of values.</v>

218
00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:48.560
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly neurologically instantiated and partly sociologically</v>

219
00:08:48.561 --> 00:08:52.340
<v Speaker 1>instantiated become as we come to a negotiated agreement about what constitutes</v>

220
00:08:52.341 --> 00:08:52.940
<v Speaker 1>value,</v>

221
00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:56.010
<v Speaker 1>just like we do about what constitutes economically.</v>

222
00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:01.310
<v Speaker 1>And so the structure that reduces facts to values is a reducing structure that's</v>

223
00:09:02.791 --> 00:09:06.000
<v Speaker 1>similar caneously and Stan Shealy instantiated neurologically and</v>

224
00:09:06.001 --> 00:09:06.960
<v Speaker 1>sociologically.</v>

225
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.470
<v Speaker 1>And I understand that a lot more clearly because I had these discussions with</v>

226
00:09:10.471 --> 00:09:13.050
<v Speaker 1>Sam and I'm writing a lot about that in this next book,</v>

227
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:15.530
<v Speaker 1>which is it's a followup.</v>

228
00:09:15.531 --> 00:09:19.650
<v Speaker 1>I s I suspect that's the plan at the moment to 12 rules for life because I had</v>

229
00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:21.330
<v Speaker 1>written originally 40 rules,</v>

230
00:09:21.331 --> 00:09:22.620
<v Speaker 1>so I have more to go.</v>

231
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:26.790
<v Speaker 1>I've written about half of the new book and I spent a lot of time writing about,</v>

232
00:09:26.791 --> 00:09:30.870
<v Speaker 1>at least in part what I had to become clearer about as a consequence of my</v>

233
00:09:30.871 --> 00:09:32.010
<v Speaker 1>discussions with Harris.</v>

234
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:36.320
<v Speaker 1>And so I took a look at the videos and I think the debates were productive and,</v>

235
00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.950
<v Speaker 1>and their audiences seem to find them.</v>

236
00:09:37.951 --> 00:09:38.251
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

237
00:09:38.251 --> 00:09:39.320
<v Speaker 1>and certainly salmon.</v>

238
00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:39.721
<v Speaker 1>I did,</v>

239
00:09:39.721 --> 00:09:41.280
<v Speaker 1>I really enjoyed meeting him.</v>

240
00:09:41.281 --> 00:09:42.270
<v Speaker 1>We got along quite well.</v>

241
00:09:42.271 --> 00:09:45.960
<v Speaker 1>He has much better sense of humor than I presumed from listening.</v>

242
00:09:45.961 --> 00:09:46.171
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

243
00:09:46.171 --> 00:09:47.550
<v Speaker 1>from the two podcasts we did.</v>

244
00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:47.851
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

245
00:09:47.851 --> 00:09:49.950
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't in great humor when I did those either.</v>

246
00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:51.203
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

247
00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:52.380
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

248
00:09:52.381 --> 00:09:54.780
<v Speaker 1>I also think that I'm also,</v>

249
00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:58.650
<v Speaker 1>what would you say I'm a fan of Sam's motivation?</v>

250
00:09:59.000 --> 00:09:59.340
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

251
00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.410
<v Speaker 1>or at least as far as I could determine it.</v>

252
00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:01.651
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

253
00:10:01.651 --> 00:10:05.610
<v Speaker 1>he wants to ground the world of value in something that isn't merely arbitrary</v>

254
00:10:05.611 --> 00:10:06.444
<v Speaker 1>revelation.</v>

255
00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:08.190
<v Speaker 1>And Fair enough,</v>

256
00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:08.521
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

257
00:10:08.521 --> 00:10:09.354
<v Speaker 1>that's a good,</v>

258
00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:14.570
<v Speaker 1>that's a good aim to ground ethics and something that's solid and not just</v>

259
00:10:15.931 --> 00:10:16.980
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary opinion,</v>

260
00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:19.320
<v Speaker 1>but I think that the devil's in the details.</v>

261
00:10:19.321 --> 00:10:21.780
<v Speaker 1>And so that's basically what we discussed.</v>

262
00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:22.591
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

263
00:10:22.591 --> 00:10:22.950
<v Speaker 1>um.</v>
