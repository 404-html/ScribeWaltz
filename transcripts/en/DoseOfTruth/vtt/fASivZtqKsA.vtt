1
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.430
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I also think,</v>

2
00:00:10.431 --> 00:00:14.210
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is laid out very</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoroughly in the biblical stories as</v>

3
00:00:14.211 --> 00:00:17.240
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that if there are enough people who</v>

4
00:00:17.241 --> 00:00:21.080
<v Speaker 1>are admirable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then things work and if there aren't and</v>

5
00:00:21.081 --> 00:00:24.500
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are terrible,</v>

6
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.010
<v Speaker 1>you get wiped out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember when Abraham is bargaining</v>

7
00:00:28.011 --> 00:00:31.520
<v Speaker 1>with God with regards to Sodom and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gomorrah,</v>

8
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.100
<v Speaker 1>he asks God to save the city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's like 40 admirable people,</v>

9
00:00:37.101 --> 00:00:38.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Respectable,</v>

10
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:39.770
<v Speaker 1>let's say admirable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

11
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't want it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say good because good is</v>

12
00:00:42.111 --> 00:00:44.780
<v Speaker 1>being corrupted in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By casual usage.</v>

13
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean admirable noble people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

14
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Abraham bargains God down to</v>

15
00:00:50.901 --> 00:00:52.970
<v Speaker 1>like 10 if there's 10 of them in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>city,</v>

16
00:00:52.971 --> 00:00:54.940
<v Speaker 1>the city won't be destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

17
00:00:54.941 --> 00:00:58.010
<v Speaker 1>that's not very many in this city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's an interesting idea there,</v>

18
00:00:58.011 --> 00:01:00.830
<v Speaker 1>which is the there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There doesn't have to be that many</v>

19
00:01:00.831 --> 00:01:03.170
<v Speaker 1>people in a group who have their act</v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

20
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.420
<v Speaker 1>but zero is the wrong number.</v>

21
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.400
<v Speaker 1>And if it's zero then then we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously in trouble.</v>

22
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.330
<v Speaker 1>And I think that goes along with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of the pareto principle in</v>

23
00:01:14.331 --> 00:01:16.820
<v Speaker 1>economics too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that it's a small minority of</v>

24
00:01:16.821 --> 00:01:19.550
<v Speaker 1>people who do most of the productive</v>
<v Speaker 1>work in any given domain.</v>

25
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.730
<v Speaker 1>But so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a small number of,</v>

26
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.750
<v Speaker 1>of properly behaving people might have</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough of an impact to keep everything</v>

27
00:01:26.751 --> 00:01:27.950
<v Speaker 1>moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that might also,</v>

28
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.160
<v Speaker 1>they might actually be true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it can't fall below some crucial</v>

29
00:01:31.161 --> 00:01:33.830
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I do think that we're in some danger</v>

30
00:01:33.831 --> 00:01:37.700
<v Speaker 1>of allowing it to fall below some</v>
<v Speaker 1>crucial level because our society seems</v>

31
00:01:37.701 --> 00:01:42.701
<v Speaker 1>to be at war in some ways against the</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of the individual and individual</v>

32
00:01:42.771 --> 00:01:47.390
<v Speaker 1>character per se.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's absolutely right.</v>
