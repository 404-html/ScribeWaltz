1
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.990
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting to look at these things from obviously from multiple</v>

2
00:00:09.991 --> 00:00:10.824
<v Speaker 1>perspectives,</v>

3
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.810
<v Speaker 1>which is another thing you had your logs don't do.</v>

4
00:00:12.811 --> 00:00:13.081
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5
00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:15.510
<v Speaker 1>Because for them everything is one cause there's one,</v>

6
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.480
<v Speaker 1>that's how you can tell when you're dealing with someone who's ideologically</v>

7
00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:22.650
<v Speaker 1>possessed is they make everything attributable to a single cause like power.</v>

8
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:23.131
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

9
00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:26.250
<v Speaker 1>but so one of the things that's happened with the nuclear family that's quite</v>

10
00:00:26.251 --> 00:00:30.450
<v Speaker 1>interesting too is that parents are older and they,</v>

11
00:00:30.451 --> 00:00:31.680
<v Speaker 1>and they have fewer children.</v>

12
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.510
<v Speaker 1>So you could imagine that that hot house environment in some senses being</v>

13
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.790
<v Speaker 1>exaggerated for a bunch of reasons.</v>

14
00:00:38.791 --> 00:00:39.624
<v Speaker 1>One is,</v>

15
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.190
<v Speaker 1>well your child is a lot more valuable to you if you're older and you only have</v>

16
00:00:44.191 --> 00:00:45.024
<v Speaker 1>one or two,</v>

17
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

18
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.280
<v Speaker 1>Because you're not going to get another chance.</v>

19
00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:48.061
<v Speaker 1>That's first of all,</v>

20
00:00:48.061 --> 00:00:50.430
<v Speaker 1>you might've had some trouble having the child to begin with.</v>

21
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.210
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

22
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.710
<v Speaker 1>and you're not going to get another chance.</v>

23
00:00:52.711 --> 00:00:54.990
<v Speaker 1>So you've got all your eggs are in one basket,</v>

24
00:00:54.991 --> 00:00:55.824
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

25
00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.150
<v Speaker 1>And then of course children don't have the number of siblings they used to have.</v>

26
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.840
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that's really useful about having siblings is that they</v>

27
00:01:03.841 --> 00:01:05.010
<v Speaker 1>keep you in your place,</v>

28
00:01:05.011 --> 00:01:05.311
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

29
00:01:05.311 --> 00:01:05.760
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

30
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.980
<v Speaker 1>they're primary socialization agents.</v>

31
00:01:07.981 --> 00:01:09.300
<v Speaker 1>And I mean that can be brutal.</v>

32
00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.240
<v Speaker 1>And that's reflected say in the story of Cain and Abel.</v>

33
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.541
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

34
00:01:12.541 --> 00:01:15.420
<v Speaker 1>that that internal household dynamic with siblings can be,</v>

35
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.600
<v Speaker 1>can really become murderous and that has to be kept under control.</v>

36
00:01:18.601 --> 00:01:19.434
<v Speaker 1>But I think the,</v>

37
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.980
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

38
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.130
<v Speaker 1>the hothouse flower person who's,</v>

39
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.810
<v Speaker 1>who's incapable of tolerating any jibes or any or any testing,</v>

40
00:01:27.811 --> 00:01:30.750
<v Speaker 1>any dominance hierarchy testing of the sort that you said that men do,</v>

41
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.010
<v Speaker 1>part of that's the consequence of being raised by older parents who have excess</v>

42
00:01:35.011 --> 00:01:35.844
<v Speaker 1>resources,</v>

43
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.500
<v Speaker 1>who have no siblings because the child is then of course special and that</v>

44
00:01:40.501 --> 00:01:41.334
<v Speaker 1>specialness,</v>

45
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.161
<v Speaker 1>well there,</v>

46
00:01:42.161 --> 00:01:46.470
<v Speaker 1>there seems to be an inverse relationship between that specialness that's</v>

47
00:01:46.471 --> 00:01:49.560
<v Speaker 1>protected and the person's robustness and resilience.</v>

48
00:01:49.561 --> 00:01:50.070
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

49
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.390
<v Speaker 1>and then that's cotton to,</v>

50
00:01:51.391 --> 00:01:52.520
<v Speaker 1>or not cotton too.</v>

51
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.210
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

52
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.043
<v Speaker 1>that's uh,</v>

53
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

54
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.060
<v Speaker 1>pandered to by the universities,</v>

55
00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.470
<v Speaker 1>which insist upon setting up a situation where no one has ever offended by</v>

56
00:02:01.471 --> 00:02:02.304
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

57
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.680
<v Speaker 1>any of the time.</v>

58
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.780
<v Speaker 1>That's something I also can't understand at all.</v>

59
00:02:05.781 --> 00:02:05.910
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

60
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:06.250
<v Speaker 2>Cause it,</v>

61
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.960
<v Speaker 2>let me just say that's a huge point you just made.</v>

62
00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:08.111
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

63
00:02:08.111 --> 00:02:11.980
<v Speaker 2>Because it's the upper middle class of the purpose of the Fred professional</v>

64
00:02:11.981 --> 00:02:14.590
<v Speaker 2>class who postpones having the children.</v>

65
00:02:14.591 --> 00:02:14.741
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

66
00:02:14.741 --> 00:02:16.390
<v Speaker 2>Because they go to law school,</v>

67
00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:17.770
<v Speaker 2>they go to medical school.</v>

68
00:02:17.771 --> 00:02:18.000
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

69
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.361
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>

70
00:02:18.361 --> 00:02:19.690
<v Speaker 2>and they have the children after their,</v>

71
00:02:19.691 --> 00:02:19.901
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

72
00:02:19.901 --> 00:02:20.531
<v Speaker 2>their settled.</v>

73
00:02:20.531 --> 00:02:20.711
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

74
00:02:20.711 --> 00:02:20.870
<v Speaker 2>In,</v>

75
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:21.101
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

76
00:02:21.101 --> 00:02:21.850
<v Speaker 2>in a drop.</v>

77
00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:22.001
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

78
00:02:22.001 --> 00:02:23.560
<v Speaker 2>So they're the ones.</v>

79
00:02:23.561 --> 00:02:23.860
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

80
00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.840
<v Speaker 2>W we have it injected this,</v>

81
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.411
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

82
00:02:26.411 --> 00:02:28.180
<v Speaker 2>this hypersensitive bourgeois.</v>

83
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.541
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>

84
00:02:28.541 --> 00:02:28.751
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

85
00:02:28.751 --> 00:02:30.430
<v Speaker 2>code into the universities.</v>

86
00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.910
<v Speaker 2>Now My,</v>

87
00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.020
<v Speaker 2>my parents were 20 when they married in 21 when they had me.</v>

88
00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.321
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

89
00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:35.621
<v Speaker 2>It made,</v>

90
00:02:35.621 --> 00:02:36.454
<v Speaker 2>my father was,</v>

91
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:37.230
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

92
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

93
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

94
00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.160
<v Speaker 2>went to college on the Gi Bill,</v>

95
00:02:39.161 --> 00:02:39.590
<v Speaker 2>getting out of,</v>

96
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.600
<v Speaker 2>out of World War II.</v>

97
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.610
<v Speaker 2>So w w when I was born,</v>

98
00:02:42.611 --> 00:02:46.060
<v Speaker 2>my father was still in college and with the sweeping the floors and so on,</v>

99
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.240
<v Speaker 2>I am the product of young parents and nature once actually Yucca parents.</v>

100
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.410
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

101
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.930
<v Speaker 2>Because,</v>

102
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:53.890
<v Speaker 2>because pregnancy is,</v>

103
00:02:53.891 --> 00:02:54.111
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

104
00:02:54.111 --> 00:02:54.821
<v Speaker 2>is quicker,</v>

105
00:02:54.821 --> 00:02:55.571
<v Speaker 2>it's safer.</v>

106
00:02:55.571 --> 00:02:55.841
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

107
00:02:55.841 --> 00:02:56.350
<v Speaker 2>And so on.</v>

108
00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.670
<v Speaker 2>And my parents had the energy.</v>

109
00:02:57.671 --> 00:02:57.970
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

110
00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:58.803
<v Speaker 2>Too.</v>

111
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.680
<v Speaker 2>That's useful energy that can do spirit that came out of world war two and so</v>

112
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:02.920
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

113
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm positive that then.</v>

114
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.500
<v Speaker 2>Then my only other sibling was born 14 years later.</v>

115
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.980
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

116
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:09.581
<v Speaker 2>My father,</v>

117
00:03:09.581 --> 00:03:11.290
<v Speaker 2>this point was a college professor.</v>

118
00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:11.620
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

119
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.040
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

120
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.770
<v Speaker 2>So she had completely different parents then and then I did.</v>

121
00:03:14.771 --> 00:03:17.120
<v Speaker 2>So she has very excellent manners and so on.</v>

122
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.980
<v Speaker 2>She's completely different.</v>

123
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.420
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

124
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.820
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

125
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.140
<v Speaker 2>And I have all this energy of,</v>

126
00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.491
<v Speaker 2>I mean it might,</v>

127
00:03:21.491 --> 00:03:23.080
<v Speaker 2>my parents were just a lot of other teams,</v>

128
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.180
<v Speaker 2>but now today we have this situation.</v>

129
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.770
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

130
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.060
<v Speaker 2>it's considered heresy to raise this issue.</v>

131
00:03:28.061 --> 00:03:28.720
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

132
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.820
<v Speaker 2>That you have have young women are told,</v>

133
00:03:30.821 --> 00:03:31.360
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

134
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.380
<v Speaker 2>there's one future for you.</v>

135
00:03:32.381 --> 00:03:33.340
<v Speaker 2>You are a future leader.</v>

136
00:03:33.341 --> 00:03:33.790
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

137
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:34.241
<v Speaker 2>You must,</v>

138
00:03:34.241 --> 00:03:37.340
<v Speaker 2>you must move forward four years of college and,</v>

139
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.470
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

140
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:38.920
<v Speaker 2>and perhaps it was a professional class.</v>

141
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:39.751
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

142
00:03:39.751 --> 00:03:41.890
<v Speaker 2>so it may be the women,</v>

143
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.690
<v Speaker 2>young women's bodies are signaling that they want to be [inaudible].</v>

144
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:47.260
<v Speaker 2>Maybe,</v>

145
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
<v Speaker 2>maybe there are signals coming from the body,</v>

146
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.080
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

147
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.630
<v Speaker 2>Maybe now wanting this,</v>

148
00:03:52.631 --> 00:03:53.081
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
