00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:00.601
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>

2
00:00:00.601 --> 00:00:01.440
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Peterson.</v>

3
00:00:01.441 --> 00:00:03.300
<v Speaker 1>I've been trying to listen to my conscience,</v>

4
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.760
<v Speaker 1>but I can't tell the difference between fear,</v>

5
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.950
<v Speaker 1>willful blindness or genuine conscience.</v>

6
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:09.023
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

7
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.570
<v Speaker 1>the first thing I would say about that is it is quite clear that you are in fact</v>

8
00:00:12.571 --> 00:00:15.930
<v Speaker 1>trying to listen to your conscience because that's probably the first thing that</v>

9
00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:16.830
<v Speaker 1>you discover.</v>

10
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.450
<v Speaker 1>So that's a really good question.</v>

11
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.973
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

12
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.413
<v Speaker 1>Fear,</v>

13
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.130
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

14
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.000
<v Speaker 1>here's the test and you don't want to do this stupidly.</v>

15
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.210
<v Speaker 1>If you think that you should do something and you think that the reason you</v>

16
00:00:36.211 --> 00:00:38.760
<v Speaker 1>might not be doing it is because you're afraid,</v>

17
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.080
<v Speaker 1>then you should do it.</v>

18
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.060
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

19
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.220
<v Speaker 1>So that way you can find out if it's fear,</v>

20
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.321
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

21
00:00:46.321 --> 00:00:47.280
<v Speaker 1>I think your question is,</v>

22
00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:47.401
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

23
00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:50.640
<v Speaker 1>how do I know my conscience isn't just masquerading as fear saying,</v>

24
00:00:50.641 --> 00:00:50.761
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

25
00:00:50.761 --> 00:00:51.690
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't do that,</v>

26
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.510
<v Speaker 1>but it's rationalizing the real issue,</v>

27
00:00:54.511 --> 00:00:55.950
<v Speaker 1>which is you're afraid of doing that.</v>

28
00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

29
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.073
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

30
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.930
<v Speaker 1>here's a reason that you want to tell the truth.</v>

31
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.950
<v Speaker 1>And I parked,</v>

32
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.400
<v Speaker 1>I kind of figured this out when I was looking deeply into the Pinocchio Story.</v>

33
00:01:05.401 --> 00:01:09.300
<v Speaker 1>You know when Pinocchio as Pinocchio strives to become real,</v>

34
00:01:09.301 --> 00:01:09.800
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

35
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.550
<v Speaker 1>he has a conscience to guide him,</v>

36
00:01:11.551 --> 00:01:12.960
<v Speaker 1>but it's jimminy cricket,</v>

37
00:01:12.961 --> 00:01:13.800
<v Speaker 1>this insect.</v>

38
00:01:13.801 --> 00:01:16.380
<v Speaker 1>But Jimmy hasn't really got very good conscience.</v>

39
00:01:16.381 --> 00:01:17.970
<v Speaker 1>He's a bit dogmatic to begin with,</v>

40
00:01:17.971 --> 00:01:19.620
<v Speaker 1>dogmatic and didn't experienced.</v>

41
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.140
<v Speaker 1>And so it's,</v>

42
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.050
<v Speaker 1>it's not like the conscience is an unerring guide.</v>

43
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.750
<v Speaker 1>It's like a partner in discovery.</v>

44
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.260
<v Speaker 1>And as you move forward in your life and you consult your conscience and you</v>

45
00:01:33.841 --> 00:01:34.674
<v Speaker 1>listen to it,</v>

46
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.490
<v Speaker 1>then it gets smarter and so to you.</v>

47
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.650
<v Speaker 1>But there's a code of there.</v>

48
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.000
<v Speaker 1>And this is why I've suggested part of the reason why I've suggested so</v>

49
00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:49.740
<v Speaker 1>frequently in my lectures and in my book that people try not to lie.</v>

50
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:50.773
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>

51
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.500
<v Speaker 1>there are many systems,</v>

52
00:01:52.501 --> 00:01:53.970
<v Speaker 1>you have many systems within,</v>

53
00:01:53.971 --> 00:01:54.804
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

54
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.900
<v Speaker 1>that guide you and one of those is your capacity for rational thought.</v>

55
00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:03.360
<v Speaker 1>And then you have a variety of emotional systems and motivational systems and</v>

56
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.540
<v Speaker 1>internal dramas and intuitions and bodily sensations like lots and lots of and</v>

57
00:02:09.721 --> 00:02:10.554
<v Speaker 1>sensors,</v>

58
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.600
<v Speaker 1>lots of systems that are guiding you.</v>

59
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.930
<v Speaker 1>And many of them operate,</v>

60
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.853
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

61
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.110
<v Speaker 1>unconsciously,</v>

62
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.370
<v Speaker 1>autonomously,</v>

63
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.560
<v Speaker 1>instinctively,</v>

64
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:23.461
<v Speaker 1>implicitly,</v>

65
00:02:23.461 --> 00:02:24.294
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>

66
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.570
<v Speaker 1>Now you PR nonetheless,</v>

67
00:02:27.571 --> 00:02:30.300
<v Speaker 1>you program them like you feed them content,</v>

68
00:02:30.301 --> 00:02:32.940
<v Speaker 1>let's say just like you feed your body nourishment,</v>

69
00:02:32.941 --> 00:02:37.941
<v Speaker 1>you feed them content and a lot of the content that you feed them pertains</v>

70
00:02:37.951 --> 00:02:41.850
<v Speaker 1>directly to your voluntary thoughts and speech and your actions.</v>

71
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.820
<v Speaker 1>And then if you pathologize those by lying.</v>

72
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.690
<v Speaker 1>So if you say things that you know not to be true or you don't say things that</v>

73
00:02:48.691 --> 00:02:50.370
<v Speaker 1>you know to be true when you need to,</v>

74
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:51.660
<v Speaker 1>which is more common.</v>

75
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.270
<v Speaker 1>And if you act in ways that you consider that back act in ways you considered</v>

76
00:02:57.271 --> 00:02:58.110
<v Speaker 1>reprehensible,</v>

77
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.190
<v Speaker 1>then you pathologize all of those autonomous systems that guide you.</v>

78
00:03:03.191 --> 00:03:04.810
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're programming them badly.</v>

79
00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:08.020
<v Speaker 1>You're building an AI system inside yourself really in,</v>

80
00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.280
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

81
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.910
<v Speaker 1>in some sense that is what you're doing.</v>

82
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.010
<v Speaker 1>That has very bad,</v>

83
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.810
<v Speaker 1>it's very bad training data.</v>

84
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.910
<v Speaker 1>And so the output it produces will be,</v>

85
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.500
<v Speaker 1>we'll won't guide you properly.</v>

86
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.920
<v Speaker 1>And so you don't want to pathologize your guidance systems.</v>

87
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.390
<v Speaker 1>It's a really bad idea.</v>

88
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.610
<v Speaker 1>So that's why you have to not lie.</v>

89
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.540
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that's also why you have to say what you have to say.</v>

90
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:32.950
<v Speaker 1>And you have to say it clearly as well.</v>

91
00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:34.090
<v Speaker 1>And you have to learn how to do that.</v>

92
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.410
<v Speaker 1>So that's one of the ways of getting your conscience straightened out.</v>

93
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.050
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to have a dialogue with your conscience.</v>

94
00:03:41.051 --> 00:03:41.801
<v Speaker 1>And you might ask,</v>

95
00:03:41.801 --> 00:03:42.101
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

96
00:03:42.101 --> 00:03:42.401
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

97
00:03:42.401 --> 00:03:43.930
<v Speaker 1>well what should I do?</v>

98
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.920
<v Speaker 1>Or what should,</v>

99
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.020
<v Speaker 1>should I do this or should I not do this?</v>

100
00:03:47.021 --> 00:03:48.040
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you're thinking,</v>

101
00:03:48.041 --> 00:03:49.030
<v Speaker 1>should I not do this?</v>

102
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.200
<v Speaker 1>In the case of a temptation,</v>

103
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.670
<v Speaker 1>maybe you have a chance to develop a new relationship.</v>

104
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:55.001
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

105
00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:55.834
<v Speaker 1>and you're,</v>

106
00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:01.050
<v Speaker 1>you're excited about it and apprehensive about it and afraid of it and you don't</v>

107
00:04:01.091 --> 00:04:03.520
<v Speaker 1>know how to sort out all those feelings.</v>

108
00:04:03.521 --> 00:04:06.970
<v Speaker 1>And the first thing is you really have to want to sort them out.</v>

109
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.230
<v Speaker 1>That's why you have to orient yourself to something that's a genuine up.</v>

110
00:04:11.231 --> 00:04:13.120
<v Speaker 1>You know that the star above the horizon,</v>

111
00:04:13.121 --> 00:04:17.980
<v Speaker 1>you have to really want things to be straight and you have to have thought that</v>

112
00:04:17.981 --> 00:04:18.640
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>

113
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.270
<v Speaker 1>And you have to know what it means for things not to be straight.</v>

114
00:04:22.271 --> 00:04:25.540
<v Speaker 1>And really what it means is that you're headed for hell in one way or another.</v>

115
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.850
<v Speaker 1>And if you understand that it's enough,</v>

116
00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.740
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's enough to scare you straight.</v>

117
00:04:29.741 --> 00:04:31.000
<v Speaker 1>You really got to think that through.</v>

118
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.650
<v Speaker 1>Then you've got to think about how much better it would be if you aimed up and,</v>

119
00:04:34.651 --> 00:04:37.210
<v Speaker 1>and that really has to kind of permeate your whole being.</v>

120
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.760
<v Speaker 1>And so then you're oriented that way.</v>

121
00:04:39.761 --> 00:04:43.090
<v Speaker 1>You're oriented up and you're deciding that it's okay to try to tell the truth</v>

122
00:04:43.091 --> 00:04:46.570
<v Speaker 1>and then you can start to rely on this dialogue with your conscience.</v>

123
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.340
<v Speaker 1>But both of you have to learn and you're going to make mistakes along the way.</v>

124
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.050
<v Speaker 1>You know that that's okay.</v>

125
00:04:53.051 --> 00:04:53.561
<v Speaker 1>You can say,</v>

126
00:04:53.561 --> 00:04:53.711
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

127
00:04:53.711 --> 00:04:55.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try this without being certain that it's right.</v>

128
00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.400
<v Speaker 1>You can even say,</v>

129
00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say this without being certain that it's correct.</v>

130
00:05:00.791 --> 00:05:03.220
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're arguing with your wife or your husband or your,</v>

131
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.151
<v Speaker 1>or your sister,</v>

132
00:05:04.151 --> 00:05:04.984
<v Speaker 1>your father,</v>

133
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.630
<v Speaker 1>and you have an idea about what might be going on,</v>

134
00:05:07.631 --> 00:05:08.470
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>

135
00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.843
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

136
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.520
<v Speaker 1>here's my idea about what's going on.</v>

137
00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.883
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

138
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.780
<v Speaker 1>who knows what that idea might be contaminated with,</v>

139
00:05:16.781 --> 00:05:20.110
<v Speaker 1>like maybe I'm putting it forward just because I'm too proud or arrogant or</v>

140
00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:21.970
<v Speaker 1>angry or fearful or whatever.</v>

141
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:23.800
<v Speaker 1>That's possible.</v>

142
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.420
<v Speaker 1>Let's see if we can figure that out.</v>

143
00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.120
<v Speaker 1>But you can offer it tentatively and both have add it.</v>

144
00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.770
<v Speaker 1>That's what you do if it's a hypothesis,</v>

145
00:05:32.771 --> 00:05:32.951
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

146
00:05:32.951 --> 00:05:36.040
<v Speaker 1>You both have at it and see if it's an idea that's worthy of,</v>

147
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.380
<v Speaker 1>of keeping you do that with your conscience and then you weren't move forward.</v>

148
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:43.460
<v Speaker 1>There's this,</v>

149
00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.320
<v Speaker 1>there's a technique and behavioral psychology called psychotherapy called</v>

150
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:48.610
<v Speaker 1>collaborative empiricism.</v>

151
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.290
<v Speaker 1>So let's say that we,</v>

152
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.320
<v Speaker 1>you and I have been sitting down and we decided that you're going to try</v>

153
00:05:53.321 --> 00:05:54.910
<v Speaker 1>something new this week,</v>

154
00:05:54.911 --> 00:05:58.130
<v Speaker 1>like maybe your agoraphobic and you're having a hard time in a parking lot.</v>

155
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.130
<v Speaker 1>And so getting out of the car and going to the grocery store.</v>

156
00:06:01.131 --> 00:06:01.970
<v Speaker 1>So maybe we say,</v>

157
00:06:01.971 --> 00:06:05.720
<v Speaker 1>well in to drive to the grocery store and you just get to walk halfway to the</v>

158
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.150
<v Speaker 1>halfway from your car to the door and that's good enough for like do that every</v>

159
00:06:11.151 --> 00:06:14.330
<v Speaker 1>second day for a week and then come back and let's talk about it.</v>

160
00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.070
<v Speaker 1>So that's collaborative empiricism,</v>

161
00:06:16.071 --> 00:06:17.630
<v Speaker 1>you're running a little experiment,</v>

162
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:18.493
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

163
00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.780
<v Speaker 1>well your conscience is guiding you towards something.</v>

164
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:25.130
<v Speaker 1>You take a tentative step in that direction and then you check and see,</v>

165
00:06:25.131 --> 00:06:25.401
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

166
00:06:25.401 --> 00:06:26.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

167
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.080
<v Speaker 1>did what I wanted to have happen or occur as an outcome.</v>

168
00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:31.760
<v Speaker 1>That's the crucial question.</v>

169
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.190
<v Speaker 1>And that's the crucial question for behavioral truth,</v>

170
00:06:34.191 --> 00:06:34.401
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

171
00:06:34.401 --> 00:06:36.110
<v Speaker 1>That's the pragmatic perspective.</v>

172
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:41.380
<v Speaker 1>Did what I want to have happen happen as a consequence of my framework of</v>

173
00:06:41.421 --> 00:06:43.010
<v Speaker 1>interpretation and my action.</v>

174
00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:45.290
<v Speaker 1>If the answer is yes,</v>

175
00:06:45.291 --> 00:06:47.930
<v Speaker 1>then I have not invalidated it.</v>

176
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.650
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

177
00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:49.010
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

178
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:51.290
<v Speaker 1>that's the pragmatic philosophy in a nutshell.</v>

179
00:06:51.291 --> 00:06:51.611
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

180
00:06:51.611 --> 00:06:52.251
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

181
00:06:52.251 --> 00:06:53.084
<v Speaker 1>very smart.</v>

182
00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:01.160
<v Speaker 1>So you have a dialogue with your conscience that never ends and hopefully it</v>

183
00:07:01.161 --> 00:07:03.710
<v Speaker 1>gets wiser and you get wiser.</v>

184
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:05.503
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

185
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:10.760
<v Speaker 1>that's the dialogue that young talked about between the conscious and the</v>

186
00:07:10.761 --> 00:07:11.600
<v Speaker 1>unconscious,</v>

187
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:12.703
<v Speaker 1>between your,</v>

188
00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:15.310
<v Speaker 1>your fantasy life,</v>

189
00:07:15.311 --> 00:07:20.260
<v Speaker 1>say the life that sort of underneath you as a conscious being like the life</v>

190
00:07:20.261 --> 00:07:22.270
<v Speaker 1>that's part of your biological platform,</v>

191
00:07:22.271 --> 00:07:26.650
<v Speaker 1>the biological platform that somehow miraculously gives rise to your</v>

192
00:07:26.651 --> 00:07:27.490
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

193
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:29.410
<v Speaker 1>If a dialogue with that,</v>

194
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.800
<v Speaker 1>we're always in dialogue.</v>

195
00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.060
<v Speaker 1>We're always in dialogue,</v>

196
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:34.540
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

197
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:35.373
<v Speaker 1>with everything.</v>

198
00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:37.803
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

199
00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:39.850
<v Speaker 2>pursue that.</v>
