1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:00.973
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

2
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:07.550
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

3
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.550
<v Speaker 1>Jacobs smart enough to get out there and which is also not really a testament to</v>

4
00:00:13.131 --> 00:00:14.450
<v Speaker 1>his integrity.</v>

5
00:00:14.451 --> 00:00:15.140
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

6
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's done these terrible things at the behest of his mother because he</v>

7
00:00:19.611 --> 00:00:23.660
<v Speaker 1>wants power and he wants to get it without deserving it.</v>

8
00:00:23.661 --> 00:00:28.340
<v Speaker 1>And then he finally goes too far and he hightails it out of there to his,</v>

9
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.050
<v Speaker 1>to another family member,</v>

10
00:00:30.051 --> 00:00:31.970
<v Speaker 1>to his mother's brother.</v>

11
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.163
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

12
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.030
<v Speaker 1>it's not exactly the world's most heroic story,</v>

13
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.893
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

14
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.030
<v Speaker 1>And so now there's an interlude here,</v>

15
00:00:41.031 --> 00:00:42.770
<v Speaker 1>and this is a really interesting interlude.</v>

16
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.710
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

17
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.230
<v Speaker 1>it's the story of Jacob's ladder.</v>

18
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.830
<v Speaker 1>So he's off to visit La band or lab and who's,</v>

19
00:00:48.831 --> 00:00:49.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.880
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

21
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.610
<v Speaker 1>his mother's brother and on the way he,</v>

22
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:53.440
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

23
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.130
<v Speaker 1>he has a sleep and he lighted upon a certain place and tarried there all night</v>

24
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.790
<v Speaker 1>because the sun was sad and he took of the stones of that place and put them for</v>

25
00:01:01.791 --> 00:01:02.624
<v Speaker 1>his pillows,</v>

26
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.040
<v Speaker 1>which seems to indicate very bad planning on,</v>

27
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.760
<v Speaker 1>on his part and,</v>

28
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.510
<v Speaker 1>and lay down in that place to sleep.</v>

29
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.750
<v Speaker 1>And he dreamed and behold a ladder set up on the earth.</v>

30
00:01:11.751 --> 00:01:15.530
<v Speaker 1>And the top of it reached to heaven and beheld the angels of God ascending and</v>

31
00:01:15.531 --> 00:01:16.364
<v Speaker 1>descending on it.</v>

32
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.590
<v Speaker 1>And behold the lord stood above it and said,</v>

33
00:01:18.591 --> 00:01:20.000
<v Speaker 1>I am the Lord God of Abraham,</v>

34
00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:22.130
<v Speaker 1>thy father and the god of Isaac,</v>

35
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.240
<v Speaker 1>the land we're on Belle liased to the I will give it and to thy seed.</v>

36
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.710
<v Speaker 1>And so this story of Jacob's ladder has really possessed the imagination of the</v>

37
00:01:32.871 --> 00:01:33.620
<v Speaker 1>West.</v>

38
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:34.940
<v Speaker 1>And there's a reason for that.</v>

39
00:01:34.941 --> 00:01:38.780
<v Speaker 1>It's because it's an archetypal story because the idea of a ladder that reaches</v>

40
00:01:38.781 --> 00:01:41.360
<v Speaker 1>to heaven is one of the oldest ideas of mankind.</v>

41
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.660
<v Speaker 1>So you'll find it widely distributed among the shamanic cultures,</v>

42
00:01:44.661 --> 00:01:45.470
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

43
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.930
<v Speaker 1>And it's a hallmark of psychedelic experience.</v>

44
00:01:47.931 --> 00:01:49.370
<v Speaker 1>That's another way of thinking about it,</v>

45
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.870
<v Speaker 1>which is a very peculiar thing.</v>

46
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.240
<v Speaker 1>So there's one representation of,</v>

47
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.590
<v Speaker 1>of the ladder you see got up at the top there.</v>

48
00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm peeking out from the clouds.</v>

49
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.100
<v Speaker 1>Now you know that sort of where we get the idea that God is in heaven and the</v>

50
00:02:03.901 --> 00:02:05.180
<v Speaker 1>heavens up in the sky.</v>

51
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.020
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

52
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.570
<v Speaker 1>and that's an easy story to make fun of because you know,</v>

53
00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.530
<v Speaker 1>we've gotten up to the moon and there is no god there and,</v>

54
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:13.190
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

55
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.520
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

56
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.240
<v Speaker 1>but this,</v>

57
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.240
<v Speaker 1>this is not a reasonable way of conceptualizing what these experiences are</v>

58
00:02:19.851 --> 00:02:20.684
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

59
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.980
<v Speaker 1>these experiences,</v>

60
00:02:21.981 --> 00:02:26.981
<v Speaker 1>what this is the opening up there that's more like an opening into an alternate</v>

61
00:02:26.991 --> 00:02:27.620
<v Speaker 1>dimension.</v>

62
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:28.930
<v Speaker 1>That's a better way of thinking about it.</v>

63
00:02:28.931 --> 00:02:30.230
<v Speaker 1>It's beyond like from,</v>

64
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.850
<v Speaker 1>from the Judeo Christian perspective,</v>

65
00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:35.090
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you have to understand is that God is beyond space and time.</v>

66
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.800
<v Speaker 1>He's not in the universe,</v>

67
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.080
<v Speaker 1>he's outside the universe in some manner.</v>

68
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.260
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea that that you have an experience of God and it's op isn't the</v>

69
00:02:44.261 --> 00:02:49.261
<v Speaker 1>APP is the best that the human imagination can do with what's essentially a form</v>

70
00:02:49.581 --> 00:02:54.260
<v Speaker 1>of extra dimensional experience or that's the best way to conceptualize it.</v>

71
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.150
<v Speaker 1>And these experiences aren't rare.</v>

72
00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.421
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

73
00:02:56.421 --> 00:02:56.800
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

74
00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.633
<v Speaker 1>they make the,</v>

75
00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:58.820
<v Speaker 1>they make up the core of,</v>

76
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Speaker 1>of the shamanic tradition.</v>

77
00:03:00.191 --> 00:03:03.490
<v Speaker 1>And so there's an intrusion of the ancient shamanic tradition,</v>

78
00:03:03.491 --> 00:03:07.960
<v Speaker 1>which is tens of thousands of years old into the biblical stories at this point.</v>

79
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.140
<v Speaker 1>Now why Jacob had a essentially shamonic experience is very difficult to tell</v>

80
00:03:13.691 --> 00:03:16.090
<v Speaker 1>because we don't know what these old people we're up to.</v>

81
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.390
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

82
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.900
<v Speaker 1>and we don't know how much of the Archaic Tradition,</v>

83
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.531
<v Speaker 1>archaic,</v>

84
00:03:20.531 --> 00:03:24.640
<v Speaker 1>religious tradition was still extent at that at that point in time,</v>

85
00:03:24.641 --> 00:03:29.641
<v Speaker 1>but we certainly do know that our ancient forebears were using psychedelic</v>

86
00:03:30.011 --> 00:03:32.590
<v Speaker 1>substances constantly like am Anita Mascara,</v>

87
00:03:32.591 --> 00:03:33.101
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms,</v>

88
00:03:33.101 --> 00:03:33.701
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

89
00:03:33.701 --> 00:03:36.760
<v Speaker 1>which were widely used in India before they became extinct.</v>

90
00:03:36.761 --> 00:03:37.481
<v Speaker 1>That's the theory.</v>

91
00:03:37.481 --> 00:03:38.314
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

92
00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.140
<v Speaker 1>that seemed to be the basis of the Chemical Soma,</v>

93
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.270
<v Speaker 1>which a much has been written about,</v>

94
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.840
<v Speaker 1>and so we hear this as a dream or has a vision and perhaps that's what it was,</v>

95
00:03:49.361 --> 00:03:54.220
<v Speaker 1>but perhaps that wasn't what it was either and perhaps it was an experience that</v>

96
00:03:54.221 --> 00:03:59.221
<v Speaker 1>was induced by I by the same processes that shamonic people have always induced</v>

97
00:04:01.921 --> 00:04:04.090
<v Speaker 1>these experiences and so we're going to go through this a little bit.</v>

98
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.410
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

99
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:06.180
<v Speaker 1>there's A.</v>

100
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.530
<v Speaker 1>There's a connection between heaven and earth that opens up.</v>

101
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.881
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

102
00:04:08.881 --> 00:04:09.420
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

103
00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.253
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>

104
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.960
<v Speaker 1>that's the vision and there's messenger is moving up and down.</v>

105
00:04:13.961 --> 00:04:14.320
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

106
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.900
<v Speaker 1>one way you can conceptualize that is psychologically,</v>

107
00:04:16.901 --> 00:04:18.160
<v Speaker 1>as we already discussed,</v>

108
00:04:18.161 --> 00:04:19.160
<v Speaker 1>that you know,</v>

109
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.570
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

110
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.570
<v Speaker 1>there are forces within you that are active and alive and you can think of them</v>

111
00:04:25.091 --> 00:04:29.200
<v Speaker 1>in some sense as messengers of the higher self and so you could think about this</v>

112
00:04:29.201 --> 00:04:31.780
<v Speaker 1>as an image of a psychological reality,</v>

113
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.540
<v Speaker 1>but and so we can stick with that,</v>

114
00:04:34.541 --> 00:04:35.374
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

115
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.363
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

116
00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.390
<v Speaker 1>here's some of the representations that have been made.</v>

117
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.280
<v Speaker 1>I really liked the one on the right.</v>

118
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.960
<v Speaker 1>That's William Blake.</v>

119
00:04:43.961 --> 00:04:48.961
<v Speaker 1>I liked the a helix idea and I don't think that that's a fluke.</v>

120
00:04:49.481 --> 00:04:52.390
<v Speaker 1>There are helixes and double helix is in all sorts of images,</v>

121
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:53.253
<v Speaker 1>imagery,</v>

122
00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.310
<v Speaker 1>very ancient and very modern that are associated with both healing and with this</v>

123
00:04:57.311 --> 00:04:58.144
<v Speaker 1>kind of vision.</v>

124
00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:59.290
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

125
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.840
<v Speaker 1>and you see it in the blake representation.</v>

126
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.580
<v Speaker 1>God is associated with,</v>

127
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.430
<v Speaker 1>well really with the sun and with light,</v>

128
00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.590
<v Speaker 1>and you see that on the left as well,</v>

129
00:05:08.591 --> 00:05:11.050
<v Speaker 1>that wherever God is is where light is.</v>

130
00:05:11.051 --> 00:05:14.320
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a very interesting idea as far as I'm concerned as well.</v>
