<v Speaker 1>I've recently developed a nasty case of hitting the phobia,</v>

2
00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:13.450
<v Speaker 1>generally suffer from anxiety surrounding sleep.</v>

3
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.850
<v Speaker 1>It's become a significant negative force in my life,</v>

4
00:00:15.851 --> 00:00:16.750
<v Speaker 1>cause unknown,</v>

5
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm rather well put together and successful across many domains.</v>

6
00:00:20.171 --> 00:00:21.010
<v Speaker 1>Any advice?</v>

7
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:22.143
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

8
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.350
<v Speaker 1>go to bed later.</v>

9
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.790
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that happens to people when they're having a hard time</v>

10
00:00:27.791 --> 00:00:30.880
<v Speaker 1>going to sleep and their sleep is disrupted is that they tend to go to bed</v>

11
00:00:30.881 --> 00:00:32.560
<v Speaker 1>earlier to catch up on their sleep.</v>

12
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.670
<v Speaker 1>And that actually has a counter that's cut,</v>

13
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.730
<v Speaker 1>that works at counter purposes to what they're trying to attempt.</v>

14
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.780
<v Speaker 1>What you want to do is delay your sleep until you're really quite tired.</v>

15
00:00:43.781 --> 00:00:45.040
<v Speaker 1>So stay up much later.</v>

16
00:00:45.041 --> 00:00:46.670
<v Speaker 1>Get up at the same time in the morning,</v>

17
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.420
<v Speaker 1>but move your sleep time later,</v>

18
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.210
<v Speaker 1>maybe half an hour night until you actually do fall asleep.</v>

19
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

20
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.430
<v Speaker 1>the other thing that you could look into is that there are relaxation exercises.</v>

21
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.170
<v Speaker 1>Behavior therapist offered those,</v>

22
00:00:59.171 --> 00:01:02.260
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sure you could find one online at a breathing exercise.</v>

23
00:01:02.261 --> 00:01:06.730
<v Speaker 1>And so often what you do is imagine you're laying in your bed and you're</v>

24
00:01:06.731 --> 00:01:07.241
<v Speaker 1>nervous.</v>

25
00:01:07.241 --> 00:01:11.980
<v Speaker 1>And so what you do is you concentrate on your feet and you flex your toes and</v>

26
00:01:11.981 --> 00:01:13.990
<v Speaker 1>then breathe in and out and relax them.</v>

27
00:01:13.991 --> 00:01:17.470
<v Speaker 1>And then you flex your ankles or their soles of your feet and,</v>

28
00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.620
<v Speaker 1>and breathe in and out and relax and do that with every muscle group all the way</v>

29
00:01:22.781 --> 00:01:27.130
<v Speaker 1>up your body and remember to breathe deeply and regularly and that can help</v>

30
00:01:27.131 --> 00:01:28.330
<v Speaker 1>regulate your anxiety.</v>

31
00:01:28.331 --> 00:01:32.590
<v Speaker 1>So I would say stay up later till you're clearly tired.</v>

32
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:33.490
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

33
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.950
<v Speaker 1>the other thing you might try is sleeping in a different room.</v>

34
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.113
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

35
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.950
<v Speaker 1>and then the final thing is there are pretty effective sleep medications like</v>

36
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.810
<v Speaker 1>Zap laplant for example,</v>

37
00:01:43.811 --> 00:01:45.520
<v Speaker 1>which is seems to be pretty effective.</v>

38
00:01:45.521 --> 00:01:47.770
<v Speaker 1>And if you're really having a hard time sleeping,</v>

39
00:01:47.771 --> 00:01:52.150
<v Speaker 1>maybe you could try something like that and see if it and see if it helps.</v>

40
00:01:52.151 --> 00:01:53.440
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to try it forever.</v>

41
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.100
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

42
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.360
<v Speaker 1>so the simplest thing to do though is to go to bed later and because you'll be</v>

43
00:01:58.361 --> 00:02:00.410
<v Speaker 1>more tired and more likely to fall asleep then.</v>

44
00:02:00.411 --> 00:02:02.410
<v Speaker 1>And it's really not going to cause you any trouble,</v>

45
00:02:02.411 --> 00:02:04.210
<v Speaker 1>so that's what I recommend.</v>

46
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.180
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
