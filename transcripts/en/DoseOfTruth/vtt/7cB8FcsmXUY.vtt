1
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.970
<v Speaker 1>On the radical left and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>superficial view,</v>

2
00:00:08.971 --> 00:00:13.080
<v Speaker 1>belief and value on the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How has this influenced by their own raw</v>

3
00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:14.910
<v Speaker 1>emotions inviting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>questionable,</v>

4
00:00:14.911 --> 00:00:17.190
<v Speaker 1>immoral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and dangerous actions despite good</v>

5
00:00:17.191 --> 00:00:18.630
<v Speaker 1>intentions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6
00:00:18.631 --> 00:00:20.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't really buy the whole good</v>
<v Speaker 1>intentions thing.</v>

7
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's really hard to have</v>

8
00:00:23.221 --> 00:00:25.270
<v Speaker 1>good intentions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like John the,</v>

9
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.330
<v Speaker 1>the question I just answered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:30.331 --> 00:00:32.190
<v Speaker 1>John said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at myself honestly,</v>

11
00:00:32.191 --> 00:00:34.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm deeply envious and resentful of</v>
<v Speaker 1>others happiness.</v>

12
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you listen to the Lindsay shepherd</v>

13
00:00:38.431 --> 00:00:43.431
<v Speaker 1>recording at Wilfrid laurier university</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you listen to the professors and</v>

14
00:00:44.041 --> 00:00:46.650
<v Speaker 1>that the administrators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's,</v>

15
00:00:46.651 --> 00:00:47.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

16
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.480
<v Speaker 1>it's absurd to start with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>presupposition that they have good</v>

17
00:00:51.481 --> 00:00:53.400
<v Speaker 1>intentions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they have good intentions</v>

18
00:00:53.401 --> 00:00:55.050
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

19
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:56.671
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

20
00:00:56.671 --> 00:01:00.960
<v Speaker 1>we could give the devil his due and say</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are people on the left end of</v>

21
00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:01.860
<v Speaker 1>the spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

22
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.330
<v Speaker 1>like there are all parts of the spectrum</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are,</v>

23
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.790
<v Speaker 1>are trying to do good things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but having good intentions and figuring</v>

24
00:01:08.791 --> 00:01:13.590
<v Speaker 1>out how to do well in the world are our</v>
<v Speaker 1>good intentions are only the beginning.</v>

25
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.370
<v Speaker 1>And people are always influenced by raw</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions and fuzzy thinking and it's</v>

26
00:01:20.401 --> 00:01:24.840
<v Speaker 1>hard to think critically and it's hard</v>
<v Speaker 1>to plan strategically and it's hard to,</v>

27
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.490
<v Speaker 1>to intervene in the world in a way that</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't cause trouble,</v>

28
00:01:29.491 --> 00:01:32.640
<v Speaker 1>which is partly why I recommend to</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that they start local,</v>

29
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't even trust your own good</v>

30
00:01:36.901 --> 00:01:40.890
<v Speaker 1>intentions to some degree because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to test out what you do when you</v>

31
00:01:40.891 --> 00:01:44.700
<v Speaker 1>have good intentions and see if it</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually produces the result that's</v>

32
00:01:44.701 --> 00:01:48.750
<v Speaker 1>intended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I wouldn't make the case to begin</v>

33
00:01:48.751 --> 00:01:50.080
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

34
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.500
<v Speaker 1>especially on the radical end of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>

35
00:01:52.501 --> 00:01:55.350
<v Speaker 1>I think it's unbelievably motivated by</v>
<v Speaker 1>resentment.</v>
