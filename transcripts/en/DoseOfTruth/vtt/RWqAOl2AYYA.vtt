00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:07.850
<v Speaker 1>There's a tipping point.</v>

2
00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.320
<v Speaker 1>It was corruption much direction before you hit that tipping point.</v>

3
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.730
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is the moral behavior of each individual is far more</v>

4
00:00:16.731 --> 00:00:18.380
<v Speaker 1>important that people generally think,</v>

5
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.760
<v Speaker 1>cause it doesn't take many cheaters getting away with it to make those who don't</v>

6
00:00:24.321 --> 00:00:26.300
<v Speaker 1>cheat think that they're fools.</v>

7
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.720
<v Speaker 1>It's the probability of being caught.</v>

8
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:30.770
<v Speaker 1>That's the deterrent,</v>

9
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.480
<v Speaker 1>isn't the severity of the punishment.</v>

10
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.690
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

11
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.770
<v Speaker 1>We know that that doesn't,</v>

12
00:00:34.771 --> 00:00:36.150
<v Speaker 1>that isn't questionable.</v>

13
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.440
<v Speaker 1>We know that that's the case.</v>

14
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.120
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know why conservatives don't,</v>

15
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.740
<v Speaker 1>the reason they don't get it is because they vote by,</v>

16
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:42.031
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:00:42.031 --> 00:00:45.120
<v Speaker 1>they think by their temperament and their temperament says punish.</v>

18
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.090
<v Speaker 1>It's not thinking it's just a temperamental response.</v>

19
00:00:48.091 --> 00:00:49.350
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the liberal responses,</v>

20
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.423
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

21
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:51.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.080
<v Speaker 1>those poor criminals must've had something happened to them that was terrible in</v>

23
00:00:55.081 --> 00:00:56.490
<v Speaker 1>their past or they wouldn't be criminals,</v>

24
00:00:56.491 --> 00:00:56.990
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

25
00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.400
<v Speaker 1>just equally as nonsensical.</v>

27
00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
