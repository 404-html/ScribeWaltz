Hello,

2
00:00:07.701 --> 00:00:08.480
Dr. Peterson.

3
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.570
Do you ever fear that your psychological reading of the Bible is wrong?

4
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.730
While I'm sure it's wrong in some ways,

5
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.430
even Satan can use scripture for his own purpose.

6
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.370
What if you're just using the word for your own gate?

7
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:19.881
Well,

8
00:00:19.881 --> 00:00:21.500
then God helped me.

9
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.010
I guess that's,

10
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.050
that's what I would say.

11
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.960
What if I'm just using the word for my own gain?

12
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.870
I guess it would depend on what you think of his game.

13
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.640
I am using it for my own gain,

14
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.600
but I would say that I've aligned my own game with the gain of others and that's

15
00:00:37.671 --> 00:00:38.600
made my own game.

16
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:39.800
It's a weird thing,

17
00:00:39.801 --> 00:00:40.041
right?

18
00:00:40.041 --> 00:00:44.990
Because if I'm see that way I can have my cake and eat it too.

19
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.180
I can do what I think is best for me,

20
00:00:47.181 --> 00:00:47.991
but at the same time,

21
00:00:47.991 --> 00:00:49.760
I can do what is best for others.

22
00:00:49.761 --> 00:00:54.761
And I've also defined what is best for me as what is simile Tamia Asley best for

23
00:00:55.281 --> 00:00:55.970
others.

24
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:56.721
And I believe that.

25
00:00:56.721 --> 00:00:57.830
I truly believe that.

26
00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.800
I think I'm fully convinced of that because I've thought it through,

27
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.053
so,

28
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.920
<v 2>okay.</v>

29
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.060
<v 1>That's my answer to that.</v>
