00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:07.750
<v Speaker 1>Your University,</v>

2
00:00:07.751 --> 00:00:09.130
<v Speaker 1>your online university.</v>

3
00:00:09.131 --> 00:00:12.160
<v Speaker 1>You and I spoke about that yesterday a bit and you were telling me that the</v>

4
00:00:12.161 --> 00:00:12.994
<v Speaker 1>modules,</v>

5
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:13.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.730
<v Speaker 1>are in place or are sort of impressed.</v>

7
00:00:15.731 --> 00:00:16.620
<v Speaker 1>We're starting to design,</v>

8
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:17.290
<v Speaker 1>well we've,</v>

9
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.930
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you some of the guiding principles of the,</v>

10
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.710
<v Speaker 1>it's the first thing we did was lay out a set of principles that the university</v>

11
00:00:23.711 --> 00:00:24.640
<v Speaker 1>will operate under.</v>

12
00:00:24.641 --> 00:00:25.474
<v Speaker 1>So we want to,</v>

13
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.590
<v Speaker 1>right now it costs about $50,000 a year per student,</v>

14
00:00:29.591 --> 00:00:32.380
<v Speaker 1>which I think is about 10 times more expensive than it should be.</v>

15
00:00:32.381 --> 00:00:33.730
<v Speaker 1>So we want to cut the price.</v>

16
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.130
<v Speaker 1>We want to cut the price by probably a factor of 10 and hopefully a factor of</v>

17
00:00:39.131 --> 00:00:39.964
<v Speaker 1>50.</v>

18
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.340
<v Speaker 1>We want to make the humanities education and science education universally</v>

19
00:00:45.341 --> 00:00:46.870
<v Speaker 1>except accessible.</v>

20
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.430
<v Speaker 1>We want to distribute,</v>

21
00:00:48.431 --> 00:00:52.000
<v Speaker 1>we want to make it an open source university in some sense so that there's no</v>

22
00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:53.440
<v Speaker 1>centralized administration.</v>

23
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.980
<v Speaker 1>We're going to put it outside of the reach of administrators and probably</v>

24
00:00:56.981 --> 00:01:01.570
<v Speaker 1>outside of the reach of the regulations that are credit universities in general</v>

25
00:01:01.571 --> 00:01:03.730
<v Speaker 1>because we're going to set up our own accreditation system.</v>

26
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.540
<v Speaker 1>So we want to operate completely independently of the traditional university</v>

27
00:01:07.541 --> 00:01:12.541
<v Speaker 1>environment and we're going to make it a truly internet university.</v>

28
00:01:12.701 --> 00:01:15.880
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to be lectures and multiple choice questions.</v>

29
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.280
<v Speaker 1>We want to take advantage of the technology.</v>

30
00:01:18.281 --> 00:01:23.200
<v Speaker 1>So the first module we're designing and we want to teach people to write,</v>

31
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.440
<v Speaker 1>speak and think that's,</v>

32
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.440
<v Speaker 1>that's the goals as well as to familiarize themselves with the treasures of the</v>

33
00:01:29.441 --> 00:01:29.951
<v Speaker 1>past,</v>

34
00:01:29.951 --> 00:01:30.784
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

35
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.280
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing we've designed is a writing module.</v>

36
00:01:36.281 --> 00:01:39.610
<v Speaker 1>We're going to release it in modules so that we can test them against the</v>

37
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.080
<v Speaker 1>potential market.</v>

38
00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.030
<v Speaker 1>Instead of,</v>

39
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

40
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.430
<v Speaker 1>designing the whole university and launching it.</v>

41
00:01:45.431 --> 00:01:46.150
<v Speaker 1>We don't want to do that.</v>

42
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.530
<v Speaker 1>We want to do it piece by piece.</v>

43
00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.290
<v Speaker 1>The first thing we're going to do is to set up a system,</v>

44
00:01:50.291 --> 00:01:51.580
<v Speaker 1>little enabled people to,</v>

45
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.170
<v Speaker 1>to leaf through paragraphs of from different topics.</v>

46
00:01:56.171 --> 00:02:00.940
<v Speaker 1>So there'll be listed by topics so that you can find a paragraph pertaining to</v>

47
00:02:00.941 --> 00:02:04.780
<v Speaker 1>some philosophical or scientific issue that's or literary issue that strikes</v>

48
00:02:04.781 --> 00:02:05.381
<v Speaker 1>your interest.</v>

49
00:02:05.381 --> 00:02:09.340
<v Speaker 1>And then you'll have a chance to write a summary of it,</v>

50
00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.460
<v Speaker 1>to rewrite it or to write a commentary on it,</v>

51
00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.400
<v Speaker 1>then to vote on other people's summaries,</v>

52
00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:17.050
<v Speaker 1>commentaries or rewrites.</v>

53
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:18.543
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

54
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.020
<v Speaker 1>so that there'll be,</v>

55
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.980
<v Speaker 1>there'll be a competition for writing of the highest quality and so that all of</v>

56
00:02:27.431 --> 00:02:30.760
<v Speaker 1>the topics can be expanded and annotated and so,</v>

57
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.370
<v Speaker 1>and we'll use crowd</v>

58
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.330
<v Speaker 1>the crowd intelligence essentially to,</v>

59
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.933
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

60
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.230
<v Speaker 1>to do the evaluations.</v>

61
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.030
<v Speaker 1>So that will be distributed as well.</v>

62
00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.253
<v Speaker 1>And then your,</v>

63
00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.330
<v Speaker 1>your accreditation points will be dependent on how well you're evaluated</v>

64
00:02:49.331 --> 00:02:50.560
<v Speaker 1>essentially by your peers.</v>

65
00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.160
<v Speaker 1>And we'll,</v>

66
00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.690
<v Speaker 1>we'll give people more voting power as they progress through the courses so that</v>

67
00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.390
<v Speaker 1>when you first start and you haven't taken any courses,</v>

68
00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.210
<v Speaker 1>then you're voting power will be very restricted.</v>

69
00:03:01.211 --> 00:03:04.540
<v Speaker 1>But as you take more and more courses and become more and more qualified,</v>

70
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.660
<v Speaker 1>then the power of your vote will improve.</v>

71
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.390
<v Speaker 1>So those are some of the ideas so far.</v>

72
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.811
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

73
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:11.980
<v Speaker 1>I know all my professors,</v>

74
00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:15.550
<v Speaker 1>you still lament the fact that students couldn't write and they would complain</v>

75
00:03:15.551 --> 00:03:16.540
<v Speaker 1>about this religiously,</v>

76
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.360
<v Speaker 1>that the writing standard of essays and research papers,</v>

77
00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:20.380
<v Speaker 1>they said it was atrocious,</v>

78
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.910
<v Speaker 1>atrocious,</v>

79
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:22.743
<v Speaker 1>atrocious.</v>

80
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.540
<v Speaker 1>I've had in my fourth year seminar,</v>

81
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.340
<v Speaker 1>I have 20 kids.</v>

82
00:03:27.341 --> 00:03:28.120
<v Speaker 1>Basically,</v>

83
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.420
<v Speaker 1>they're pretty damn bright because it's hard to get into psychology owners.</v>

84
00:03:31.421 --> 00:03:32.410
<v Speaker 1>It's an honor seminar.</v>

85
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.330
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to get into psychology honors.</v>

86
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.830
<v Speaker 1>They're hardworking kids.</v>

87
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

88
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.050
<v Speaker 1>they're devoted to those classes</v>

89
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:40.870
<v Speaker 1>and they can't.</v>

90
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.920
<v Speaker 1>When the first test,</v>

91
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.990
<v Speaker 1>I have them write the same essay four times,</v>

92
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.280
<v Speaker 1>it gets a first time,</v>

93
00:03:45.281 --> 00:03:46.120
<v Speaker 1>it's four pages,</v>

94
00:03:46.121 --> 00:03:47.590
<v Speaker 1>then it's six pages,</v>

95
00:03:47.591 --> 00:03:48.580
<v Speaker 1>then it's eight pages.</v>

96
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.900
<v Speaker 1>I think that's maybe it's three times and each time I provide them with a lot of</v>

97
00:03:55.181 --> 00:03:55.770
<v Speaker 1>feedback,</v>

98
00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:56.121
<v Speaker 1>tear terror,</v>

99
00:03:56.121 --> 00:03:57.040
<v Speaker 1>their papers apart.</v>

100
00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.850
<v Speaker 1>The first papers are so bad that they're actually,</v>

101
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.680
<v Speaker 1>I would say physically painful,</v>

102
00:04:02.681 --> 00:04:04.480
<v Speaker 1>degrade choices,</v>

103
00:04:04.481 --> 00:04:05.230
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>

104
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.620
<v Speaker 1>The words aren't integrated properly into the sentences.</v>

105
00:04:08.621 --> 00:04:11.560
<v Speaker 1>The sentences aren't organized properly into paragraphs.</v>

106
00:04:11.561 --> 00:04:13.600
<v Speaker 1>The paragraphs aren't sequenced properly.</v>

107
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.040
<v Speaker 1>The essay isn't coherent.</v>

108
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.840
<v Speaker 1>There are there,</v>

109
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.430
<v Speaker 1>I would say they're terrible.</v>

110
00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:22.180
<v Speaker 1>They really deserve 70% of them likely deserve an f.</v>

111
00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.300
<v Speaker 1>Now what happens is that I only,</v>

112
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.800
<v Speaker 1>the first essay is only worth 5% so I could just slash it to death without</v>

113
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.950
<v Speaker 1>hurting their chances for a decent grade in the course.</v>

114
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.630
<v Speaker 1>By the second essay,</v>

115
00:04:37.631 --> 00:04:39.430
<v Speaker 1>things have improved quite a lot and by,</v>

116
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.270
<v Speaker 1>I think I do do it four times by the third and the fourth by the fourth essay,</v>

117
00:04:43.271 --> 00:04:46.120
<v Speaker 1>and that's the only one semester the students are writing,</v>

118
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.691
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

119
00:04:46.691 --> 00:04:47.141
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

120
00:04:47.141 --> 00:04:48.610
<v Speaker 1>the best essays they've ever read,</v>

121
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.910
<v Speaker 1>they all tell me that and essays that are in comparatively better to the ones</v>

122
00:04:54.011 --> 00:04:55.750
<v Speaker 1>that they had started with,</v>

123
00:04:55.751 --> 00:05:00.130
<v Speaker 1>and it's really sad because it shows that they have never been taught to write</v>

124
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.000
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that they're very bright and now they have 16 years of</v>

125
00:05:04.001 --> 00:05:04.834
<v Speaker 1>education,</v>

126
00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.280
<v Speaker 1>they've never been taught to write.</v>

127
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.550
<v Speaker 1>So we really want to solve that problem and we want to make people into</v>

128
00:05:09.551 --> 00:05:13.300
<v Speaker 1>effective speakers and effective thinkers and that'll be about a five year</v>

129
00:05:13.301 --> 00:05:13.751
<v Speaker 1>project,</v>

130
00:05:13.751 --> 00:05:14.561
<v Speaker 1>but it's well underway.</v>

131
00:05:14.561 --> 00:05:17.830
<v Speaker 1>I got two people working on it now we're sketching out the modules.</v>

132
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to devote a lot of time and resources to it over the next well into</v>

133
00:05:23.501 --> 00:05:26.140
<v Speaker 1>the foreseeable future because it's a really exciting project.</v>
