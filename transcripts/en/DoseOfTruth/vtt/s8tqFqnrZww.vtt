00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.050
<v Speaker 1>How does one distinguish a statement coming from oneself rather than from</v>

2
00:00:10.051 --> 00:00:10.650
<v Speaker 1>radiology?</v>

3
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:10.921
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

4
00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:12.690
<v Speaker 1>I got a good hint about that.</v>

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.460
<v Speaker 1>If you're saying something that almost anyone else could say,</v>

6
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.360
<v Speaker 1>then it's likely to be either cliched or ideological.</v>

7
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.921
<v Speaker 1>Where is,</v>

8
00:00:22.921 --> 00:00:24.510
<v Speaker 1>if you're speaking from yourself,</v>

9
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.380
<v Speaker 1>then in some sense you're the only person who could be saying that.</v>

10
00:00:28.381 --> 00:00:31.980
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means in some sense is that you've taken ideas,</v>

11
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.791
<v Speaker 1>philosophical,</v>

12
00:00:32.791 --> 00:00:33.900
<v Speaker 1>even ideological,</v>

13
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.170
<v Speaker 1>and you've made them personal so that you're speaking from a position that only</v>

14
00:00:39.571 --> 00:00:40.650
<v Speaker 1>you can speak from.</v>

15
00:00:40.651 --> 00:00:42.810
<v Speaker 1>And then then you have something original offer.</v>

16
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.013
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

17
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.180
<v Speaker 1>in Solzhenitsyn school,</v>

18
00:00:45.181 --> 00:00:45.961
<v Speaker 1>like archipelago,</v>

19
00:00:45.961 --> 00:00:46.780
<v Speaker 1>he talked about,</v>

20
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:47.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.150
<v Speaker 1>like radical communists who were thrown into the Gulag and they used to play</v>

22
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.320
<v Speaker 1>comrade with them.</v>

23
00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:53.061
<v Speaker 1>It was a game.</v>

24
00:00:53.061 --> 00:00:58.061
<v Speaker 1>And what they would do is bait them into making continual propagandistic</v>

25
00:00:58.141 --> 00:00:59.550
<v Speaker 1>communists statements.</v>

26
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.910
<v Speaker 1>It was an attempt to try to educate them out of their possession.</v>

27
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.800
<v Speaker 1>But it's a good,</v>

28
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.090
<v Speaker 1>see if you can predict what someone is going to say on the basis of their set of</v>

29
00:01:09.091 --> 00:01:09.924
<v Speaker 1>beliefs,</v>

30
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.940
<v Speaker 1>then they're not speaking.</v>

31
00:01:11.941 --> 00:01:13.140
<v Speaker 1>The ideology is speaking.</v>

32
00:01:13.141 --> 00:01:14.460
<v Speaker 1>And if the ideology is speaking,</v>

33
00:01:14.461 --> 00:01:15.600
<v Speaker 1>you don't even have to listen to them.</v>

34
00:01:15.601 --> 00:01:19.140
<v Speaker 1>You could just read about the ideology and make up your own mind now.</v>

35
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.860
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

36
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:20.730
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of the,</v>

37
00:01:20.731 --> 00:01:21.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

38
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.171
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>

39
00:01:22.171 --> 00:01:25.830
<v Speaker 1>That's the objective view of this.</v>

40
00:01:25.831 --> 00:01:29.940
<v Speaker 1>The subjective view is that statements come from yourself that come from</v>

41
00:01:29.941 --> 00:01:30.451
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

42
00:01:30.451 --> 00:01:31.261
<v Speaker 1>I think first of all,</v>

43
00:01:31.261 --> 00:01:34.770
<v Speaker 1>frighten you to some degree because you actually opened yourself up to the world</v>

44
00:01:34.771 --> 00:01:36.270
<v Speaker 1>by saying something genuine,</v>

45
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.450
<v Speaker 1>but they also make you stronger.</v>

46
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.110
<v Speaker 1>They make you feel stronger put because I think you're confronting your</v>

47
00:01:43.111 --> 00:01:44.430
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability properly.</v>

48
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.301
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

49
00:01:45.301 --> 00:01:49.080
<v Speaker 1>Because if I tell you something that I really don't believe and you criticize,</v>

50
00:01:49.081 --> 00:01:50.070
<v Speaker 1>it's like who cares?</v>

51
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.290
<v Speaker 1>Because I don't really believe but believe it anyways,</v>

52
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.830
<v Speaker 1>so maybe I have an ideology that's like a mask or a persona,</v>

53
00:01:55.831 --> 00:01:58.340
<v Speaker 1>which is generally the case personas,</v>

54
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.390
<v Speaker 1>a end concept that means mask.</v>

55
00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:03.810
<v Speaker 1>And it's often the thing that people confuse with their real identity.</v>

56
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.411
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

57
00:02:04.411 --> 00:02:06.540
<v Speaker 1>if I have a persona and someone criticizes it,</v>

58
00:02:06.541 --> 00:02:06.960
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

59
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.111
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

60
00:02:07.111 --> 00:02:08.580
<v Speaker 1>you haven't got to the real meat.</v>

61
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.870
<v Speaker 1>But if I say something that I really believe deeply believe,</v>

62
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.250
<v Speaker 1>and then it gets criticized,</v>

63
00:02:14.251 --> 00:02:15.990
<v Speaker 1>like I've really put myself on the line.</v>

64
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.550
<v Speaker 1>And so people don't do that.</v>

65
00:02:17.551 --> 00:02:18.780
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of frightening,</v>

66
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:19.200
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

67
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.700
<v Speaker 1>it's still the way to genuine strength because you need,</v>

68
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.320
<v Speaker 1>and also not just strength,</v>

69
00:02:25.321 --> 00:02:26.310
<v Speaker 1>but also value.</v>

70
00:02:26.311 --> 00:02:31.311
<v Speaker 1>You need to manifest yourself in the world because you're a unique thing and</v>

71
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.140
<v Speaker 1>people bite need.</v>

72
00:02:34.141 --> 00:02:35.340
<v Speaker 1>What's unique about you?</v>

73
00:02:35.341 --> 00:02:36.960
<v Speaker 1>Everybody else might really need that.</v>

74
00:02:36.961 --> 00:02:41.460
<v Speaker 1>I believe that you don't because each person has something that's unique to them</v>

75
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.830
<v Speaker 1>to bring into being.</v>

76
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.360
<v Speaker 1>And if they hide that,</v>

77
00:02:45.361 --> 00:02:46.800
<v Speaker 1>they hide their light under a Bushel,</v>

78
00:02:46.801 --> 00:02:49.140
<v Speaker 1>that everyone is poorer for it.</v>

79
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.930
<v Speaker 1>And you do that in part as Social Nitsa says,</v>

80
00:02:51.931 --> 00:02:52.651
<v Speaker 1>by turning in,</v>

81
00:02:52.651 --> 00:02:56.430
<v Speaker 1>you're turning over your God given sole to human dogma.</v>

82
00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.110
<v Speaker 1>It's a very bad idea.</v>

83
00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.400
<v Speaker 1>Very bad idea.</v>
