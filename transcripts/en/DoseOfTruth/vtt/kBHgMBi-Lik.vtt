00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm beginning to sort myself out.</v>

2
00:00:09.221 --> 00:00:10.054
<v Speaker 1>Thanks to you.</v>

3
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.650
<v Speaker 1>While I'm very glad to hear that.</v>

4
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.260
<v Speaker 1>I have a question about scheduling your time,</v>

5
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.080
<v Speaker 1>trying to make a schedule in a chaotic job with constantly changing shifts and</v>

6
00:00:20.081 --> 00:00:24.070
<v Speaker 1>out tips or should I find a new job all together?</v>

7
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.533
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

8
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

9
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

10
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.790
<v Speaker 1>I can't answer that Josh because I don't know enough about the details of your</v>

11
00:00:32.791 --> 00:00:33.624
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

12
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.560
<v Speaker 1>But what I would say,</v>

13
00:00:34.561 --> 00:00:36.990
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you've tried this already is you know,</v>

14
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.150
<v Speaker 1>try to make two plants.</v>

15
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.990
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

16
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.980
<v Speaker 1>Because when you're,</v>

17
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.840
<v Speaker 1>when you're trying to think something like this through,</v>

18
00:00:42.841 --> 00:00:44.730
<v Speaker 1>you need to think it through in detail.</v>

19
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.240
<v Speaker 1>And so one plan would be how you would conduct your life optimally and organize</v>

20
00:00:50.881 --> 00:00:55.830
<v Speaker 1>your time if you kept your current job and you want to make that as acceptable</v>

21
00:00:55.831 --> 00:01:00.300
<v Speaker 1>and positive as possible and then make out another plan where you shift jobs and</v>

22
00:01:00.301 --> 00:01:01.260
<v Speaker 1>you have no,</v>

23
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.730
<v Speaker 1>maybe a more stable working arrangement and then think about what your life</v>

24
00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:07.590
<v Speaker 1>would be like if you had that.</v>

25
00:01:07.591 --> 00:01:10.620
<v Speaker 1>And then because you've laid out a detailed map of both,</v>

26
00:01:10.621 --> 00:01:12.600
<v Speaker 1>you're in a much better position to compare them.</v>

27
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.063
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

28
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.253
<v Speaker 2>mmm.</v>

29
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.171
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

30
00:01:16.171 --> 00:01:18.210
<v Speaker 1>you might need to talk to somebody about that too.</v>

31
00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:22.620
<v Speaker 1>But that's what I would recommend because it's just too complicated a job.</v>

32
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.240
<v Speaker 1>Like if you find that your sleep is chronically disrupted and you can't organize</v>

33
00:01:27.241 --> 00:01:28.074
<v Speaker 1>your life,</v>

34
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.560
<v Speaker 1>the fact that shift changes,</v>

35
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.860
<v Speaker 1>no trivial thing.</v>

36
00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:34.560
<v Speaker 1>And it can really throw your mood regulation for a loop too.</v>

37
00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:36.000
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know if that's happening to you.</v>

38
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.330
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>

39
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.960
<v Speaker 1>but that's also something else that's worth taking into consideration.</v>

40
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.240
<v Speaker 1>But I would say map out an alternative reality where you don't have those</v>

41
00:01:45.241 --> 00:01:47.550
<v Speaker 1>problems and see how much better that looks.</v>

42
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

43
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.640
<v Speaker 1>I presume there's some advantages to your current job.</v>

44
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.391
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

45
00:01:51.391 --> 00:01:53.520
<v Speaker 1>and it also depends on what your options are.</v>

46
00:01:53.521 --> 00:01:57.480
<v Speaker 1>Like how hard would it be for you to find another job and could you find a job,</v>

47
00:01:57.481 --> 00:02:00.840
<v Speaker 1>like maybe the best thing to do would be to try to find a job that's better,</v>

48
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.520
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't have shifts,</v>

49
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.451
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

50
00:02:03.451 --> 00:02:05.190
<v Speaker 1>and maybe that'll take you a year or two.</v>

51
00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:05.580
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

52
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.750
<v Speaker 1>that can be very difficult.</v>

53
00:02:06.751 --> 00:02:07.584
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

54
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.280
<v Speaker 1>a year or two is a shorter period of time.</v>

55
00:02:11.281 --> 00:02:14.490
<v Speaker 1>Often that it seems so that's what I would recommend.</v>

56
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.510
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
