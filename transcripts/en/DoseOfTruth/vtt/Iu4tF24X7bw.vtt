1
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.580
<v Speaker 1>So let's talk about Rogers for a minute.</v>

2
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.300
<v Speaker 1>He was a devout fundamentalist Protestant.</v>

3
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.700
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's important to know because a lot of his thinking has a very</v>

4
00:00:23.601 --> 00:00:25.360
<v Speaker 1>strong Protestant flavor.</v>

5
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

6
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.890
<v Speaker 1>the reason I concentrate on such things and the philosophical background,</v>

7
00:00:30.891 --> 00:00:31.700
<v Speaker 1>if these thinkers,</v>

8
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.510
<v Speaker 1>because you have to understand the axioms,</v>

9
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.030
<v Speaker 1>the safer that you're dealing with dirt,</v>

10
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.980
<v Speaker 1>you actually don't understand them at all.</v>

11
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.250
<v Speaker 1>And when you're assessing the axiomatic presuppositions of the paper,</v>

12
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.690
<v Speaker 1>you're usually outside the thinkers thought in some sense,</v>

13
00:00:44.691 --> 00:00:44.961
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

14
00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:46.400
<v Speaker 1>Because you're looking at axioms,</v>

15
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.920
<v Speaker 1>but you don't get it unless you,</v>

16
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.280
<v Speaker 1>unless you know the accident.</v>

17
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.340
<v Speaker 1>And so Carl Rogers thought was deeply grounded in his Protestantism,</v>

18
00:00:55.341 --> 00:00:56.174
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

19
00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.410
<v Speaker 1>his father in particular was a scientific farmer and applied the scientific</v>

20
00:01:00.411 --> 00:01:02.120
<v Speaker 1>method on the farm that he grew up in.</v>

21
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.510
<v Speaker 1>And so Rogers had a devout fundamentalist background of the sort that was more</v>

22
00:01:10.221 --> 00:01:15.200
<v Speaker 1>typical in the thirties and the forties but he also had us powerful,</v>

23
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:16.713
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

24
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.250
<v Speaker 1>understanding of the scientific method and practical observations of its</v>

25
00:01:22.251 --> 00:01:23.084
<v Speaker 1>utility.</v>

26
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.433
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

27
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.581
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

28
00:01:27.581 --> 00:01:31.660
<v Speaker 1>his first academic training was at the Union theological seminary seminary.</v>

29
00:01:31.661 --> 00:01:32.494
<v Speaker 1>In the mission of,</v>

30
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.700
<v Speaker 1>of that seminary was to evangelize the world in their generation.</v>

31
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.380
<v Speaker 1>If I remember correctly,</v>

32
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.960
<v Speaker 1>was when he was on a boat to China to serve as a missionary that he first</v>

33
00:01:43.961 --> 00:01:46.990
<v Speaker 1>started to question the absolute reality of his,</v>

34
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.930
<v Speaker 1>of his Protestant beliefs.</v>

35
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.340
<v Speaker 1>It isn't that he abandoned particularly,</v>

36
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.460
<v Speaker 1>it's that he incorporated them into a approach to psychotherapy that fulfilled</v>

37
00:02:02.261 --> 00:02:05.110
<v Speaker 1>all the preconditions for this.</v>

38
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.670
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

39
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.560
<v Speaker 1>there's this striving towards a kind of interpersonal perfection that goes along</v>

40
00:02:11.561 --> 00:02:12.580
<v Speaker 1>with Protestantism.</v>

41
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.380
<v Speaker 1>There's an idea that the most important realization of the most fundamental</v>

42
00:02:20.531 --> 00:02:25.531
<v Speaker 1>reality is to be had in direct and honest communication between two people</v>

43
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.363
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

44
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.550
<v Speaker 1>two or more people.</v>

45
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.550
<v Speaker 1>That's a place where you might say,</v>

46
00:02:36.551 --> 00:02:38.110
<v Speaker 1>if you're thinking about it symbolically,</v>

47
00:02:38.111 --> 00:02:43.111
<v Speaker 1>that the living word emerges and Roger's thinking is deeply,</v>

48
00:02:43.301 --> 00:02:45.850
<v Speaker 1>deeply rooted in that kind of conception.</v>

49
00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:47.110
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

50
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.340
<v Speaker 1>it's partly that he believed that if you could integrate yourself properly,</v>

51
00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.260
<v Speaker 1>if you could put yourself together in some sense at every level of analysis,</v>

52
00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.900
<v Speaker 1>then you'd be able to exist,</v>

53
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.730
<v Speaker 1>communicate in a way that was,</v>

54
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.890
<v Speaker 1>there's a Ph Eddie,</v>

55
00:03:01.891 --> 00:03:04.840
<v Speaker 1>and for to this that was optimally beneficial to you,</v>

56
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:08.290
<v Speaker 1>but also optimally beneficial to other people at the same time.</v>

57
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.320
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of that would emerge in your interactions with each other in</v>

58
00:03:13.391 --> 00:03:14.230
<v Speaker 1>communication.</v>
