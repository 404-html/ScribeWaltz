1
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.550
<v Speaker 1>That was my next point is obviously</v>
<v Speaker 1>those letters are on the intranet.</v>

2
00:00:11.551 --> 00:00:16.551
<v Speaker 1>So I was able to read them that various</v>
<v Speaker 1>professors and a certain um,</v>

3
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.010
<v Speaker 1>faculty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.650
<v Speaker 1>had signed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

5
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.200
<v Speaker 1>because you're tenured in many ways</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

6
00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:29.850
<v Speaker 1>that's a very strong safety net.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But do you ever have those moments where</v>

7
00:00:29.851 --> 00:00:32.370
<v Speaker 1>you really feel like they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you,</v>

8
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.830
<v Speaker 1>that there is a very strategic attempt</v>
<v Speaker 1>to demonize you and to isolate you in</v>

9
00:00:37.831 --> 00:00:42.540
<v Speaker 1>the university as much as possible</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost to the point that you would,</v>

10
00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:45.710
<v Speaker 1>God forbid it feel like you needed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave or resign?</v>

11
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.170
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that my job actually was in</v>

12
00:00:49.171 --> 00:00:54.171
<v Speaker 2>danger for about three months in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the year ago when all of this broken,</v>

13
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.940
<v Speaker 2>the diversity didn't really know what to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

14
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.290
<v Speaker 2>I think that they got themselves</v>
<v Speaker 2>together by December and then I went</v>

15
00:01:01.291 --> 00:01:03.990
<v Speaker 2>back teaching in January and that went</v>
<v Speaker 2>very well.</v>

16
00:01:03.991 --> 00:01:06.930
<v Speaker 2>I've had zero negative interactions with</v>
<v Speaker 2>students.</v>

17
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.490
<v Speaker 2>None and no negative interactions with</v>
<v Speaker 2>faculty members or administrators for</v>

18
00:01:11.491 --> 00:01:13.800
<v Speaker 2>that matter?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like not personally.</v>

19
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.740
<v Speaker 2>I think that there's a coterie of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

20
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.310
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the women and Gender Studies Institute,</v>

21
00:01:20.311 --> 00:01:22.800
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in and of course all the people whose</v>

22
00:01:22.801 --> 00:01:25.150
<v Speaker 2>disciplines I've vilified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

23
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.890
<v Speaker 2>And rightly so in my estimation because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't regard them as disciplines.</v>

24
00:01:28.891 --> 00:01:32.610
<v Speaker 2>There are pseudo disciplines and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>corrupting the university and more than</v>

25
00:01:32.611 --> 00:01:36.210
<v Speaker 2>the university.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I feel no compunctions whatsoever</v>

26
00:01:36.211 --> 00:01:38.610
<v Speaker 2>about what I've said about those</v>
<v Speaker 2>disciplines.</v>

27
00:01:38.611 --> 00:01:40.170
<v Speaker 2>I think there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

28
00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.960
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be hard pressed to say anything</v>

29
00:01:42.961 --> 00:01:44.400
<v Speaker 2>good about the whatsoever.</v>

30
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.350
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course,</v>

31
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.670
<v Speaker 2>and I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've really gone after the Ontario</v>

32
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.410
<v Speaker 2>Institute of Studies of Education.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I've referred to it repeatedly</v>

33
00:01:52.411 --> 00:01:55.410
<v Speaker 2>as a rat's nest central,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I really believe,</v>

34
00:01:55.411 --> 00:01:58.020
<v Speaker 2>I think it's an unbelievably dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 2>organization.</v>

35
00:01:58.021 --> 00:02:01.890
<v Speaker 2>And so it's not surprising that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

36
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.250
<v Speaker 2>especially the people who were</v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with those areas are not</v>

37
00:02:05.251 --> 00:02:06.960
<v Speaker 2>happy about me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

38
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.090
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's okay.</v>

39
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.940
<v Speaker 2>They can be unhappy about me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not a problem.</v>

40
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.843
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

41
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.850
<v Speaker 2>I think that'll change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think they have any ability</v>

42
00:02:17.851 --> 00:02:22.290
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever to move me from my position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the faculty is,</v>

43
00:02:22.291 --> 00:02:25.830
<v Speaker 2>like a month ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Faculty Association wrote a letter</v>

44
00:02:25.831 --> 00:02:29.400
<v Speaker 2>to the university condemning me because</v>
<v Speaker 2>of this website I had talked about</v>

45
00:02:29.401 --> 00:02:30.740
<v Speaker 2>making,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

46
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.280
<v Speaker 2>which I'm still toying with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

47
00:02:33.281 --> 00:02:36.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm redesigning it to her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm going to set it up so that</v>

48
00:02:36.541 --> 00:02:41.541
<v Speaker 2>they will identify non postmodern</v>
<v Speaker 2>courses instead of identifying</v>

49
00:02:41.641 --> 00:02:44.700
<v Speaker 2>postmodern courses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a better tack.</v>

50
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.010
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

51
00:02:47.011 --> 00:02:50.430
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they accused me of setting up a hate</v>

52
00:02:50.431 --> 00:02:53.850
<v Speaker 2>list of doxing and all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous things,</v>

53
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.490
<v Speaker 2>but it's just not getting any traction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Serena,</v>

54
00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.353
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

55
00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.010
<v Speaker 1>it was almost inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

56
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you became more popular in your</v>

57
00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:04.480
<v Speaker 1>videos are being watched by millions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>your reach,</v>

58
00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:09.400
<v Speaker 1>and they're scaremongering tactics</v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't worked that they would actually</v>

59
00:03:09.401 --> 00:03:12.520
<v Speaker 1>resort to some more desperate measures</v>
<v Speaker 1>to vilify you.</v>

60
00:03:12.521 --> 00:03:15.210
<v Speaker 1>And I think the latest thing they found</v>
<v Speaker 1>was this website that you're planning.</v>
