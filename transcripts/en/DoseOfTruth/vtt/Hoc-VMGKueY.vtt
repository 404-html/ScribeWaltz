00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.950
<v Speaker 1>So today I'm going to tell you the best three stories that I know.</v>

2
00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:15.220
<v Speaker 1>I think these stories are absolutely phenomenally potent and the reason for that</v>

3
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.730
<v Speaker 1>is that I think they illustrate in an extraordinarily powerful way the nature of</v>

4
00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:31.001
<v Speaker 1>the processes that led to the establishment of Western democratic ideals.</v>

5
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.760
<v Speaker 1>Rosia Aly outta whose work I rely on substantial substantially to make the</v>

6
00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:42.971
<v Speaker 1>following argument has taken Western academic culture to task in a manner that</v>

7
00:00:45.801 --> 00:00:47.990
<v Speaker 1>hasn't fully been revealed yet.</v>

8
00:00:47.991 --> 00:00:50.750
<v Speaker 1>He said that like all human cultures,</v>

9
00:00:50.751 --> 00:00:55.751
<v Speaker 1>the West is parochial and narrow in its viewpoint and although over the last 300</v>

10
00:00:56.271 --> 00:01:00.210
<v Speaker 1>years there's been a substantial amount of cross cultural intermingling and a</v>

11
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.530
<v Speaker 1>potential broadening of philosophical and religious horizon.</v>

12
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.710
<v Speaker 1>That broadening has not been sufficiently complete.</v>

13
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.730
<v Speaker 1>If we build on the viewpoint that I've been developing with you over the last</v>

14
00:01:16.731 --> 00:01:21.680
<v Speaker 1>few courses and make the presupposition that religious modes of thinking are</v>

15
00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:24.140
<v Speaker 1>more phenomenological than they are rational,</v>

16
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.500
<v Speaker 1>which means that they deal more with what you experience say.</v>

17
00:01:27.501 --> 00:01:29.090
<v Speaker 1>Then with the objective world.</v>

18
00:01:29.091 --> 00:01:32.360
<v Speaker 1>If we look at our Keck religious stories through that Lens,</v>

19
00:01:32.361 --> 00:01:37.250
<v Speaker 1>then they can start to open up and so given that I want to open up three</v>

20
00:01:37.251 --> 00:01:42.251
<v Speaker 1>religious stories to you today too in depth and one only in passing because</v>

21
00:01:44.721 --> 00:01:45.950
<v Speaker 1>we'll return to it later.</v>

22
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.410
<v Speaker 1>I'll start with a Judaeo Christian myth of genesis.</v>

23
00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:55.820
<v Speaker 1>When I say myth,</v>

24
00:01:55.821 --> 00:01:57.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean untrue,</v>

25
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean a form of knowledge that's narrative instructor and predicated on</v>

26
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.350
<v Speaker 1>presumptions that aren't empirical.</v>

27
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.670
<v Speaker 1>A myth describes processes of transformation.</v>

28
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.660
<v Speaker 1>A myth describes the process whereby elements of experience come into being and</v>

29
00:02:11.661 --> 00:02:12.494
<v Speaker 1>transform.</v>

30
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.610
<v Speaker 1>The fundamental structural</v>

31
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.030
<v Speaker 1>elements of genesis are the word of God and chaos</v>

32
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.620
<v Speaker 1>and Hebrew words for chaos and waste.</v>

33
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.810
<v Speaker 1>Our town for chaos and tow who for waste and Tom in particular,</v>

34
00:02:32.811 --> 00:02:37.310
<v Speaker 1>although tto who as well are very interesting words because you can track their</v>

35
00:02:37.311 --> 00:02:41.450
<v Speaker 1>derivation historically and sometimes if you can track the derivation of words</v>

36
00:02:41.451 --> 00:02:45.200
<v Speaker 1>historically you can get some sense of the culture mill you out of which the</v>

37
00:02:45.201 --> 00:02:46.040
<v Speaker 1>word spraying.</v>

38
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.890
<v Speaker 1>And we know what time at means because we have written records of a story that</v>

39
00:02:51.891 --> 00:02:54.200
<v Speaker 1>involves a character named ty Matt.</v>

40
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.830
<v Speaker 1>And timeout is a dragon who lives at the bottom of the ocean.</v>

41
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Speaker 1>In the oldest myth we have,</v>

42
00:03:00.191 --> 00:03:01.510
<v Speaker 1>which is the Enuma Elish,</v>

43
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.160
<v Speaker 1>the Samarian creation myth,</v>

44
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.200
<v Speaker 1>Sumeria,</v>

45
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.540
<v Speaker 1>Babylon Acadia,</v>

46
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.160
<v Speaker 1>rightly regarded as the birthplace of modern western civilization</v>

47
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.190
<v Speaker 1>in genesis two,</v>

48
00:03:20.191 --> 00:03:24.780
<v Speaker 1>processes unite to produce being</v>

49
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.560
<v Speaker 1>the first of those processes are states,</v>

50
00:03:28.561 --> 00:03:31.670
<v Speaker 1>is chaos represented by Taya Marto,</v>

51
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.940
<v Speaker 1>who the second of those processes is logos.</v>

52
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.530
<v Speaker 1>And Logos is another word that has an extraordinarily broad range of meaning.</v>

53
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.240
<v Speaker 1>It's generally</v>

54
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.530
<v Speaker 1>transcribed in the Christian tradition has the word,</v>

55
00:03:46.531 --> 00:03:48.150
<v Speaker 1>and it's identified with Christ,</v>

56
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.290
<v Speaker 1>which is a very peculiar identification because it's the word of God that</v>

57
00:03:52.291 --> 00:03:54.030
<v Speaker 1>creates order out of chaos.</v>

58
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.931
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>

59
00:03:54.931 --> 00:03:59.760
<v Speaker 1>the word of God in Genesis is a phenomena that predates the birth of Christ</v>

60
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.640
<v Speaker 1>infinitely from a classical religious perspective.</v>

61
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:09.770
<v Speaker 1>So the fact that the two beings are identified as of great peculiarity and also</v>

62
00:04:10.621 --> 00:04:11.610
<v Speaker 1>of great interest.</v>
