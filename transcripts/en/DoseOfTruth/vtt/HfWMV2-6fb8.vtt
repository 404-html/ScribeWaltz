00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.530
<v Speaker 1>Let me just explain it to explain to the viewers here why this isn't just some</v>

2
00:00:10.531 --> 00:00:13.050
<v Speaker 1>like psychological geek conversation.</v>

3
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.170
<v Speaker 1>This is actually really relevant to a lot of the things that we'll be talking</v>

4
00:00:16.171 --> 00:00:19.500
<v Speaker 1>about and that your audience probably cares about because one of the most</v>

5
00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:24.270
<v Speaker 1>contested ideas and the social sciences is the idea of innateness and the ideas.</v>

6
00:00:24.271 --> 00:00:24.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

7
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.590
<v Speaker 1>if something has a need,</v>

8
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:26.820
<v Speaker 1>then it can't.</v>

9
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.990
<v Speaker 1>It can't vary across societies and if it varies across the side is then it's not</v>

10
00:00:30.991 --> 00:00:31.620
<v Speaker 1>a neat.</v>

11
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:32.880
<v Speaker 1>And if gender barriers,</v>

12
00:00:32.881 --> 00:00:35.590
<v Speaker 1>if masculinity or femininity vary across societies,</v>

13
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:36.620
<v Speaker 1>there is not an eight.</v>

14
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.010
<v Speaker 1>It's socially constructed,</v>

15
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.920
<v Speaker 1>but that's the wrong understanding of the neatness.</v>

16
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.600
<v Speaker 1>The definition that I use comes from Gary Marcus was actually a neuroscientist</v>

17
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.181
<v Speaker 1>here at Nyu.</v>

18
00:00:45.181 --> 00:00:47.580
<v Speaker 1>He says innate doesn't mean hardwired.</v>

19
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:48.450
<v Speaker 1>There's almost nothing.</v>

20
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:48.971
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly,</v>

21
00:00:48.971 --> 00:00:53.100
<v Speaker 1>it's hardwired in eight means structured in advance of experience,</v>

22
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.080
<v Speaker 1>but that experience can still revise it.</v>

23
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.440
<v Speaker 1>And boy does that work for gender,</v>

24
00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.460
<v Speaker 1>for almost everything.</v>

25
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.750
<v Speaker 1>Almost everything that we're not a blank slate about anything.</v>

26
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.790
<v Speaker 1>And something used to tell my students at Uva,</v>

27
00:01:05.791 --> 00:01:07.710
<v Speaker 1>I taught at Uva for 16 years is,</v>

28
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.930
<v Speaker 1>everything's a social construction,</v>

30
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:11.970
<v Speaker 1>masculinity,</v>

31
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.200
<v Speaker 1>femininity,</v>

32
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.423
<v Speaker 1>cancer,</v>

33
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:15.690
<v Speaker 1>the sun,</v>

34
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.440
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>

35
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.273
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

36
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.400
<v Speaker 1>There's a social construction for you won't find a society that doesn't have</v>

37
00:01:20.401 --> 00:01:21.600
<v Speaker 1>thoughts about these things.</v>

38
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.930
<v Speaker 1>But the fact that societies have social constructions tells us nothing about</v>

39
00:01:27.031 --> 00:01:30.660
<v Speaker 1>whether there is not also an underlying biological reality.</v>

40
00:01:30.661 --> 00:01:32.220
<v Speaker 1>And in almost all cases there is,</v>

41
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.030
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't be able to communicate,</v>

42
00:01:34.031 --> 00:01:36.340
<v Speaker 1>which is one of Eo Wilson's comments,</v>

43
00:01:36.341 --> 00:01:36.551
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

44
00:01:36.551 --> 00:01:36.820
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>

45
00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean Wilson is the entomologist to study down.</v>

46
00:01:39.131 --> 00:01:42.790
<v Speaker 1>So it's Harvard and also wrote number of books about sociobiology that got him</v>

47
00:01:42.791 --> 00:01:44.290
<v Speaker 1>in trouble with the radical leftists.</v>

48
00:01:44.291 --> 00:01:45.124
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

49
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.020
<v Speaker 1>even if we could communicate with ants,</v>

50
00:01:47.021 --> 00:01:50.650
<v Speaker 1>there'd be nothing to say to each other because they're fundamental mode of</v>

51
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.000
<v Speaker 1>being in the world is based on motivations and interests that are so different</v>

52
00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:57.580
<v Speaker 1>from ours that there wouldn't be any structure for communication.</v>

53
00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.390
<v Speaker 1>And you can kind of tell that with regards to the animals that we make friends</v>

54
00:02:01.391 --> 00:02:01.631
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

55
00:02:01.631 --> 00:02:01.901
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

56
00:02:01.901 --> 00:02:04.710
<v Speaker 1>We're much more likely to make friends with animals who has a,</v>

57
00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.380
<v Speaker 1>who have a fundamental biological and social nature that's very close to ours,</v>

58
00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.190
<v Speaker 1>like dogs,</v>

59
00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.260
<v Speaker 1>because we can basically speak their language,</v>

60
00:02:11.261 --> 00:02:14.790
<v Speaker 1>even though not completely a mammo language of love.</v>

61
00:02:14.791 --> 00:02:15.250
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

62
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.310
<v Speaker 1>I miss you and I want to play with you.</v>

63
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

64
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.121
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

65
00:02:18.121 --> 00:02:18.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

66
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.810
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

67
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:19.620
<v Speaker 1>And that bonding.</v>
