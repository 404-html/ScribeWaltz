1
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.021
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2
00:00:02.021 --> 00:00:06.220
<v Speaker 1>I called this series to psychological significance of the biblical stories for a</v>

3
00:00:06.221 --> 00:00:06.880
<v Speaker 1>reason,</v>

4
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:07.211
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5
00:00:07.211 --> 00:00:12.211
<v Speaker 1>and the reason was that I'm partially qualified to talk about such things when I</v>

6
00:00:15.881 --> 00:00:17.320
<v Speaker 1>step outside of that.</v>

7
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:20.263
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

8
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.340
<v Speaker 1>Then I'm not where I should be.</v>

9
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:24.460
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

10
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that,</v>

11
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.451
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

12
00:00:31.451 --> 00:00:32.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that this is,</v>

13
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:34.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to get this right.</v>

14
00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:36.100
<v Speaker 1>I can't get the words exactly right.</v>

15
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.950
<v Speaker 1>This isn't about what I believe personally.</v>

16
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.800
<v Speaker 1>It's partly because I don't know what I believe.</v>

17
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what I believe the world's a very strange place.</v>

18
00:00:45.641 --> 00:00:48.190
<v Speaker 1>I've had some very strange experiences in it.</v>

19
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's helpful for me to to step outside my my jurisdiction and</v>

20
00:00:55.241 --> 00:00:55.930
<v Speaker 1>speculate.</v>

21
00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:56.763
<v Speaker 1>Precisely.</v>

22
00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.710
<v Speaker 1>The easiest thing would be to say,</v>

23
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:04.651
<v Speaker 1>I think I said,</v>

24
00:01:04.651 --> 00:01:08.520
<v Speaker 1>but I had to say today I don't think that we know what the upper limits of human</v>

25
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.510
<v Speaker 1>possibility are.</v>

26
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:11.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

27
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that means.</v>

28
00:01:12.161 --> 00:01:12.821
<v Speaker 1>Metaphysically.</v>

29
00:01:12.821 --> 00:01:17.320
<v Speaker 1>What I do understand from the gospels is that even the accounts of Christ's</v>

30
00:01:17.321 --> 00:01:20.260
<v Speaker 1>resurrection are complex and difficult to understand.</v>

31
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.910
<v Speaker 1>I think from reading you in large part that you can make a very strong case for</v>

32
00:01:28.311 --> 00:01:30.860
<v Speaker 1>the symbolic meaning of the death and resurrection.</v>

33
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.920
<v Speaker 1>I think it does stand for the capacity of the human logos to die and resurrect</v>

34
00:01:35.991 --> 00:01:38.060
<v Speaker 1>continually as it strives upward.</v>

35
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm not willing to say that that's all it means because I don't know what</v>

36
00:01:44.451 --> 00:01:49.451
<v Speaker 1>everything means and I don't know about the fundamental metaphysics of being</v>

37
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.220
<v Speaker 1>like I do believe that it's accurate to construe being as a battleground between</v>

38
00:01:55.221 --> 00:01:56.054
<v Speaker 1>good and evil.</v>

39
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.043
<v Speaker 1>I believe that.</v>

40
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.100
<v Speaker 1>I believe that is the most accurate way of representing being.</v>

41
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.340
<v Speaker 1>It's not that most accurate way of representing the objective world.</v>

42
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:05.720
<v Speaker 1>That's not the same thing.</v>

43
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.350
<v Speaker 1>Being is that set of experiences which we inhabit and that's only partly</v>

44
00:02:12.171 --> 00:02:15.650
<v Speaker 1>objective and it's not obviously reduceable to the material.</v>

45
00:02:15.651 --> 00:02:18.830
<v Speaker 1>Not In any straight forward way because we don't understand the material</v>

46
00:02:18.831 --> 00:02:20.390
<v Speaker 1>substrate of being at all.</v>

47
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:21.421
<v Speaker 1>You know it's,</v>

48
00:02:21.421 --> 00:02:22.254
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

49
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.500
<v Speaker 1>and when we do attempt to understand it,</v>

50
00:02:24.501 --> 00:02:25.460
<v Speaker 1>say at the quantum level,</v>

51
00:02:25.461 --> 00:02:28.490
<v Speaker 1>we run into mysteries that that baffle the most,</v>

52
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.060
<v Speaker 1>the most intelligent of us and aware.</v>

53
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.210
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to have to leave the question hanging,</v>

54
00:02:35.211 --> 00:02:36.290
<v Speaker 1>but partly because,</v>

55
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.140
<v Speaker 1>partly because I don't know what I think,</v>

56
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.760
<v Speaker 1>but partly because,</v>

57
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.780
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

58
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.180
<v Speaker 1>there has to be aligned between what I believe in,</v>

59
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.073
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

60
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:48.850
<v Speaker 1>what I can communicate.</v>

61
00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.713
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>

62
00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.360
<v Speaker 1>what do you believe is beyond your capacity to articulate if you the most,</v>

63
00:02:54.361 --> 00:02:55.780
<v Speaker 1>if the deepest levels of belief,</v>

64
00:02:55.781 --> 00:03:00.520
<v Speaker 1>and I can only share with you what I have actually come understand and there's</v>

65
00:03:00.521 --> 00:03:02.980
<v Speaker 1>things that I don't understand and that's definitely one of them.</v>

66
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to draw a line between the symbolic significance of the</v>

67
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.180
<v Speaker 1>biblical events,</v>

68
00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:13.780
<v Speaker 1>say the symbolic in psychological significance of the biblical events and a</v>

69
00:03:13.781 --> 00:03:15.490
<v Speaker 1>metaphysics that's underneath them.</v>

70
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.690
<v Speaker 1>And I think you'll see the same thing in young because when you own rights,</v>

71
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.360
<v Speaker 1>technically,</v>

72
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.193
<v Speaker 1>informally,</v>

73
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.450
<v Speaker 1>he never talks about God.</v>

74
00:03:22.451 --> 00:03:24.340
<v Speaker 1>He always talks about the image of God,</v>

75
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.720
<v Speaker 1>which is not the same thing.</v>

76
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.200
<v Speaker 1>The image of God would be your subjective experience of God.</v>

77
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.040
<v Speaker 1>It says nothing about the objective reality of God because your subjective</v>

78
00:03:33.041 --> 00:03:35.230
<v Speaker 1>experience can't say much about objective reality,</v>

79
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.360
<v Speaker 1>but even in young you get this mix.</v>

80
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.110
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

81
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.580
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's psychological,</v>

82
00:03:39.581 --> 00:03:40.414
<v Speaker 1>but then he,</v>

83
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.250
<v Speaker 1>he makes a metaphysical move.</v>

84
00:03:42.251 --> 00:03:44.530
<v Speaker 1>And I think that reflected also his,</v>

85
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.430
<v Speaker 1>the limits of his knowledge because you don't have profound revelatory</v>

86
00:03:48.431 --> 00:03:50.380
<v Speaker 1>experiences if it was a very strange person,</v>

87
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.491
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

88
00:03:51.491 --> 00:03:52.540
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

89
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:53.740
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

90
00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.411
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

91
00:03:56.411 --> 00:04:01.411
<v Speaker 1>I think what's best for me is to stay on the ground that I'm competent on and to</v>

92
00:04:02.081 --> 00:04:07.081
<v Speaker 1>say what I can say about the psychology and to reach beyond that briefly when</v>

93
00:04:07.721 --> 00:04:08.501
<v Speaker 1>it's necessary.</v>

94
00:04:08.501 --> 00:04:09.251
<v Speaker 1>But other than that,</v>

95
00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:12.280
<v Speaker 1>to leave it the hell alone till I understand that better.</v>

96
00:04:12.281 --> 00:04:13.480
<v Speaker 1>Assuming that I ever do.</v>
