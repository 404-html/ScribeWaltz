1
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.370
<v Speaker 1>It certainly raised a specter in the back of people's minds.</v>

2
00:00:10.371 --> 00:00:11.450
<v Speaker 1>And this he is,</v>

3
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:12.763
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:13.920
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

5
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:14.840
<v Speaker 1>what are the rules?</v>

6
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:16.550
<v Speaker 1>Who,</v>

7
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.550
<v Speaker 1>who gets punished when they fail and who doesn't and what is too big to fail me?</v>

8
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.230
<v Speaker 1>Like I think you could reverse that.</v>

9
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.480
<v Speaker 1>So big failure is inevitable.</v>

10
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.310
<v Speaker 1>That's a really good rule of thumb.</v>

11
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:29.870
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

12
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:30.171
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

13
00:00:30.171 --> 00:00:31.360
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

14
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.630
<v Speaker 1>I think both the left and the right haven't seen that cause the left things,</v>

15
00:00:35.631 --> 00:00:38.540
<v Speaker 1>well big corporations back and the right things,</v>

16
00:00:38.541 --> 00:00:39.920
<v Speaker 1>big government bad.</v>

17
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.440
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you should just think big,</v>

18
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:43.813
<v Speaker 1>bad,</v>

19
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.770
<v Speaker 1>too many eggs in one basket.</v>

20
00:00:45.771 --> 00:00:48.020
<v Speaker 1>So it goes against the principle of diversification.</v>

21
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.071
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

22
00:00:49.071 --> 00:00:50.570
<v Speaker 1>and I think there's some real truth in this.</v>

23
00:00:50.571 --> 00:00:52.700
<v Speaker 1>I think that as things get large,</v>

24
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.770
<v Speaker 1>they turned into cyclops,</v>

25
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.120
<v Speaker 1>let lumbering one,</v>

26
00:00:56.121 --> 00:00:57.770
<v Speaker 1>I giant there,</v>

27
00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.210
<v Speaker 1>they can't see worth a damn.</v>

28
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.530
<v Speaker 1>There's single minded which makes them really narrow and they lumber around</v>

29
00:01:03.531 --> 00:01:06.530
<v Speaker 1>stepping on things accidentally until they fall off things,</v>

30
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:07.190
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

31
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.970
<v Speaker 1>And that's the right,</v>

32
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.160
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the right model for a giant system.</v>

33
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.770
<v Speaker 1>That's why we have the image of the giant site logs.</v>

34
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.641
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

35
00:01:13.641 --> 00:01:13.941
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:01:13.941 --> 00:01:18.170
<v Speaker 1>it's single mindedness turned into gigantism and it's risky.</v>

37
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.170
<v Speaker 1>So should we bail out these big companies?</v>

38
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:23.640
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

39
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.880
<v Speaker 1>There's something about that that seems radically unfair.</v>

40
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.083
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

41
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.220
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know what to do about that,</v>

43
00:01:31.221 --> 00:01:34.370
<v Speaker 1>except to note that big in and of itself</v>

44
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.830
<v Speaker 2>is troublesome.</v>
