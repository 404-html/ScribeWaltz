1
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.380
<v Speaker 1>You often mentioned disciplining children,</v>

2
00:00:09.381 --> 00:00:10.340
<v Speaker 1>so they behave.</v>

3
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.510
<v Speaker 1>What is your advice for making them behave without resorting to corporal</v>

4
00:00:14.511 --> 00:00:15.344
<v Speaker 1>punishment?</v>

5
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.861
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6
00:00:15.861 --> 00:00:16.311
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

7
00:00:16.311 --> 00:00:18.350
<v Speaker 1>it depends on what you mean by corporal punishment.</v>

8
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:19.430
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

9
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.770
<v Speaker 1>timeout could be regarded as corporal punishment.</v>

10
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.560
<v Speaker 1>It also depends very much on the age of the child,</v>

11
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.833
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

12
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:26.990
<v Speaker 1>at say a two year old,</v>

13
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.033
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

14
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.331
<v Speaker 1>in my new book,</v>

15
00:00:29.331 --> 00:00:30.164
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

16
00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.630
<v Speaker 1>I have a chapter in there called don't let your children do anything that makes</v>

17
00:00:35.631 --> 00:00:36.530
<v Speaker 1>you dislike them.</v>

18
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.080
<v Speaker 1>And the reason that I wrote a chapter about that is because people who let their</v>

19
00:00:42.081 --> 00:00:46.460
<v Speaker 1>children do things that make them dislike them end up disliking them.</v>

20
00:00:46.461 --> 00:00:48.380
<v Speaker 1>And because there's a huge power differential,</v>

21
00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:50.450
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking between adults and children,</v>

22
00:00:50.451 --> 00:00:53.480
<v Speaker 1>if you end up disliking your children because they're not behaving well,</v>

23
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.880
<v Speaker 1>they're behaving disgracefully say,</v>

24
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.720
<v Speaker 1>or they're,</v>

25
00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.720
<v Speaker 1>or they're challenging your position in the authority hierarchy to regularly</v>

26
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.830
<v Speaker 1>something he won't put up with.</v>

27
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:04.281
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

28
00:01:04.281 --> 00:01:05.420
<v Speaker 1>even if you think you will,</v>

29
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.810
<v Speaker 1>it's necessary to get your disciplinary routine straight.</v>

30
00:01:08.811 --> 00:01:13.160
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing I would say is figure out what the rules are.</v>

31
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.960
<v Speaker 1>There shouldn't be too many.</v>

32
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

33
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.790
<v Speaker 1>for two year olds basically they have to know what no means.</v>

34
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.150
<v Speaker 1>And they also have to learn as they approached three not to kick,</v>

35
00:01:25.311 --> 00:01:28.310
<v Speaker 1>hit bite or steel essentially.</v>

36
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.830
<v Speaker 1>Now it's easy to train a two year old,</v>

37
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.030
<v Speaker 1>but no means you can actually start with a child that's only 13 months old.</v>

38
00:01:35.031 --> 00:01:36.080
<v Speaker 1>A child that can cry,</v>

39
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.330
<v Speaker 1>let's say that or that can crawl.</v>

40
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.110
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that you have a child is starting to crawl and wants to explore the</v>

41
00:01:42.111 --> 00:01:42.381
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

42
00:01:42.381 --> 00:01:46.610
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing you do if you have any sense is try to get rid of most things</v>

43
00:01:46.611 --> 00:01:50.270
<v Speaker 1>that the child could cause a tremendous amount of trouble with,</v>

44
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

45
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.410
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

46
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.220
<v Speaker 1>to the things or to the child so that it's reasonably safe.</v>

47
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.593
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

48
00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.200
<v Speaker 1>and then the child is going to want to want to crawl around and get into</v>

49
00:02:00.201 --> 00:02:00.681
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

50
00:02:00.681 --> 00:02:01.250
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

51
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.370
<v Speaker 1>but maybe there are things you don't want him or her to get into.</v>

52
00:02:04.371 --> 00:02:05.880
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe there's a uh,</v>

53
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.670
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

54
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:08.510
<v Speaker 1>what would we say?</v>

55
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.550
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's a tablecloth,</v>

56
00:02:10.551 --> 00:02:12.290
<v Speaker 1>and on top of the tablecloth there's a plant,</v>

57
00:02:12.291 --> 00:02:17.270
<v Speaker 1>or maybe there's some plants on the floor and when the child is crawling and</v>

58
00:02:17.271 --> 00:02:19.820
<v Speaker 1>goes off to do something that he or she shouldn't,</v>

59
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

60
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.330
<v Speaker 1>you can just grab his leg and you know,</v>

61
00:02:23.331 --> 00:02:26.780
<v Speaker 1>gently but firmly and say no.</v>

62
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.560
<v Speaker 1>And the child will keep trying to move forward because they're stubborn little</v>

63
00:02:30.561 --> 00:02:31.280
<v Speaker 1>gliders.</v>

64
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.990
<v Speaker 1>And you can continue to say no.</v>

65
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.650
<v Speaker 1>And if you persist with saying no,</v>

66
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.610
<v Speaker 1>then the child will eventually give up and sort of go limp.</v>

67
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.020
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

68
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.960
<v Speaker 1>now and often the child will cry when you do that.</v>

69
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.210
<v Speaker 1>And of course that might make you feel guilty,</v>

70
00:02:47.211 --> 00:02:51.350
<v Speaker 1>but what that means is that you've effectively brought to behavior to a halt.</v>

71
00:02:51.351 --> 00:02:53.930
<v Speaker 1>And if you do that 10 times,</v>

72
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.700
<v Speaker 1>you've got to watch your child and don't stop them from exploring things that</v>

73
00:02:58.701 --> 00:02:59.830
<v Speaker 1>they need to explore it.</v>

74
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.070
<v Speaker 1>You want to use this sort of thing with judiciously.</v>

75
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.590
<v Speaker 1>You can grab them by the leg and say,</v>

76
00:03:05.591 --> 00:03:06.350
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

77
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:07.183
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

78
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.223
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

79
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.910
<v Speaker 1>And wait until they give up.</v>

80
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.010
<v Speaker 1>Usually they'll cry and then you can let them go.</v>

81
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.390
<v Speaker 1>And then soon after,</v>

82
00:03:13.391 --> 00:03:14.920
<v Speaker 1>you do that about 10 times soon.</v>

83
00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:17.680
<v Speaker 1>Then if you just say no with the same tone of voice,</v>

84
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.600
<v Speaker 1>the child will generally,</v>

85
00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:20.090
<v Speaker 1>what happens,</v>

86
00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.660
<v Speaker 1>the child will immediately cry and then stop.</v>

87
00:03:22.661 --> 00:03:26.350
<v Speaker 1>And then after about 10 repeats of no without having the leg grabbed,</v>

88
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:27.101
<v Speaker 1>then no,</v>

89
00:03:27.101 --> 00:03:30.100
<v Speaker 1>we'll just produce stopping of the behavior.</v>

90
00:03:30.101 --> 00:03:33.310
<v Speaker 1>And that's unbelievably useful because as soon as your,</v>

91
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.940
<v Speaker 1>you train your child to understand what no means,</v>

92
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.180
<v Speaker 1>then they really have free reign of the house in some sense with relative</v>

93
00:03:42.311 --> 00:03:43.810
<v Speaker 1>minimal supervision from you.</v>

94
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:44.441
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

95
00:03:44.441 --> 00:03:46.450
<v Speaker 1>they can learn what things they're not supposed to get into.</v>

96
00:03:46.451 --> 00:03:49.630
<v Speaker 1>And it's amazing how fast children can learn that and how fast they can</v>

97
00:03:49.631 --> 00:03:53.050
<v Speaker 1>generalize to the class of things that they shouldn't get into.</v>

98
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.000
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't have to teach them every single thing.</v>

99
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.650
<v Speaker 1>They can generalize very rapidly.</v>

100
00:03:56.651 --> 00:03:58.210
<v Speaker 1>That's not much different than thinking.</v>

101
00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.100
<v Speaker 1>But also once they are capable of understanding what no means,</v>

102
00:04:03.101 --> 00:04:07.840
<v Speaker 1>you have an extremely potent means of helping them regulate their behavior with</v>

103
00:04:07.841 --> 00:04:09.220
<v Speaker 1>a minimum of intervention.</v>

104
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.050
<v Speaker 1>So that's unbelievably useful.</v>

105
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.940
<v Speaker 1>So now let's say you have a two year old who's pretty contentious and two year</v>

106
00:04:15.941 --> 00:04:17.110
<v Speaker 1>olds are pretty contentious.</v>

107
00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.200
<v Speaker 1>Some of them in particular because both 5% of two year olds,</v>

108
00:04:20.201 --> 00:04:21.160
<v Speaker 1>most of them are male,</v>

109
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.200
<v Speaker 1>are quite aggressive by temperament.</v>

110
00:04:23.201 --> 00:04:26.530
<v Speaker 1>And those are the ones that if you put with other two year olds will frequently</v>

111
00:04:26.531 --> 00:04:28.870
<v Speaker 1>kick hit bite or steel.</v>

112
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.160
<v Speaker 1>Not all kids are like that,</v>

113
00:04:30.161 --> 00:04:30.994
<v Speaker 1>but some are,</v>

114
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.240
<v Speaker 1>and most of them get socialized out of that by the time they're about four.</v>

115
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:39.040
<v Speaker 1>Now let's say you have an at two they also start to experiment with saying no</v>

116
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.410
<v Speaker 1>back and also with misbehaving,</v>

117
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.210
<v Speaker 1>although they can do that even younger than that.</v>

118
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.770
<v Speaker 1>So if you have a two year old who's particularly rambunctious and who decides he</v>

119
00:04:47.771 --> 00:04:48.910
<v Speaker 1>isn't going to listen to you,</v>

120
00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.360
<v Speaker 1>we use [inaudible] in this example because it's boys that are more likely to</v>

121
00:04:52.361 --> 00:04:54.640
<v Speaker 1>misbehave and not I not listen.</v>

122
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.810
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

123
00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.010
<v Speaker 1>you can pick them up and you know by the arms now you gotta get your attitude</v>

124
00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.380
<v Speaker 1>right because you don't want to be stupid.</v>

125
00:05:02.381 --> 00:05:04.000
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to let your kid make you mad,</v>

126
00:05:04.001 --> 00:05:07.390
<v Speaker 1>especially when they're really little cause you're really big and you can hurt</v>

127
00:05:07.391 --> 00:05:07.541
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

128
00:05:07.541 --> 00:05:08.374
<v Speaker 1>And so you gotta,</v>

129
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:09.790
<v Speaker 1>you gotta have a clue.</v>

130
00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.220
<v Speaker 1>That's why you want to get the rules of discipline in order.</v>

131
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.250
<v Speaker 1>The minimum rules of discipline and why you want to have a strategy.</v>

132
00:05:15.251 --> 00:05:19.480
<v Speaker 1>But let's say your two or two year old is insisting upon doing something that</v>

133
00:05:19.481 --> 00:05:20.560
<v Speaker 1>you don't want him to do,</v>

134
00:05:20.561 --> 00:05:20.950
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

135
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:21.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

136
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.510
<v Speaker 1>inserting a fork into an electrical outlet and you just can't have that.</v>

137
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.250
<v Speaker 1>And so you can say no,</v>

138
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.330
<v Speaker 1>hopefully you've already done the no training that I recommended.</v>

139
00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:32.710
<v Speaker 1>And then if that doesn't work,</v>

140
00:05:32.711 --> 00:05:36.430
<v Speaker 1>what I recommend doing is picking the child up by the arms and then putting them</v>

141
00:05:36.431 --> 00:05:37.330
<v Speaker 1>on the steps.</v>

142
00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:37.961
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>

143
00:05:37.961 --> 00:05:38.171
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

144
00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:41.200
<v Speaker 1>you sit there until you're ready to listen.</v>

145
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:42.410
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

146
00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:43.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

147
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.050
<v Speaker 1>are usually the child will sit there and then the rule has to be something like</v>

148
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.570
<v Speaker 1>you can get up as soon as you're ready to be a civilized human being again.</v>

149
00:05:50.571 --> 00:05:52.450
<v Speaker 1>And you can refer to yourself,</v>

150
00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.360
<v Speaker 1>your own attitude during a process like that.</v>

151
00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.970
<v Speaker 1>Because if the child does comply and sits on the steps and then comes and says,</v>

152
00:05:58.971 --> 00:05:59.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm ready to be good,</v>

153
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.340
<v Speaker 1>and you like them again,</v>

154
00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.690
<v Speaker 1>you've got to be honest about this,</v>

155
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.820
<v Speaker 1>then you can tell that he's honest in his decision to rejoin the civilized</v>

156
00:06:07.821 --> 00:06:08.654
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

157
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.320
<v Speaker 1>Now sometimes if you put a two year old that's particularly rambunctious on the</v>

158
00:06:12.321 --> 00:06:13.154
<v Speaker 1>staircase,</v>

159
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.660
<v Speaker 1>that as soon as you let go of their arms,</v>

160
00:06:14.661 --> 00:06:15.500
<v Speaker 1>they'll run off.</v>

161
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.470
<v Speaker 1>And that can be a game or it can just be an act of defiance.</v>

162
00:06:18.471 --> 00:06:22.220
<v Speaker 1>And in that case then you go get him and he put them back on the steps and you</v>

163
00:06:22.221 --> 00:06:24.500
<v Speaker 1>do that several times if necessary.</v>

164
00:06:24.501 --> 00:06:24.891
<v Speaker 1>And if that,</v>

165
00:06:24.891 --> 00:06:25.940
<v Speaker 1>that becomes a game,</v>

166
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.090
<v Speaker 1>then you sit on the step and you hold him by the arms.</v>

167
00:06:29.091 --> 00:06:30.950
<v Speaker 1>Remember no anger cause he's just too,</v>

168
00:06:30.951 --> 00:06:31.731
<v Speaker 1>for God's sake,</v>

169
00:06:31.731 --> 00:06:31.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

170
00:06:31.911 --> 00:06:34.790
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to be angry is put them on the steps and hold up.</v>

171
00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:35.031
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>

172
00:06:35.031 --> 00:06:35.780
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

173
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm not letting you go until you sit there and behave.</v>

174
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:41.120
<v Speaker 1>And so if you hold them for a while,</v>

175
00:06:41.121 --> 00:06:42.890
<v Speaker 1>he'll squirm and look away and so forth.</v>

176
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.821
<v Speaker 1>But you can get a visit.</v>

177
00:06:43.821 --> 00:06:44.211
<v Speaker 1>Tension.</v>

178
00:06:44.211 --> 00:06:45.350
<v Speaker 1>If you're a little bit stubborn,</v>

179
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.410
<v Speaker 1>you hold them there and say you're going to sit there until I decide that you</v>

180
00:06:48.411 --> 00:06:49.460
<v Speaker 1>can leave.</v>

181
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.860
<v Speaker 1>And so you hold them and he'll squirm and,</v>

182
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:53.780
<v Speaker 1>but you can outwait them if your patient,</v>

183
00:06:53.781 --> 00:06:56.930
<v Speaker 1>but you got to make the time and then eventually he'll stop squirming and you</v>

184
00:06:56.931 --> 00:06:57.764
<v Speaker 1>can let them go.</v>

185
00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.750
<v Speaker 1>And then you can sit there and watch him.</v>

186
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:04.640
<v Speaker 1>And when you think he's decided that he's going to be a civilized creature,</v>

187
00:07:04.641 --> 00:07:07.820
<v Speaker 1>then you can say that's good and you can give them a pat on the head and you can</v>

188
00:07:07.821 --> 00:07:08.001
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

189
00:07:08.001 --> 00:07:09.500
<v Speaker 1>let's go back and do what we're doing.</v>

190
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.000
<v Speaker 1>And the rule has to be,</v>

191
00:07:11.001 --> 00:07:15.860
<v Speaker 1>you see that the punishment not only has to bring the behavior to a halt in the</v>

192
00:07:15.861 --> 00:07:17.690
<v Speaker 1>most merciful manner possible,</v>

193
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.280
<v Speaker 1>but that's still effective.</v>

194
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:24.260
<v Speaker 1>But it also has to satisfy your need for order and justice so that you don't</v>

195
00:07:24.261 --> 00:07:29.261
<v Speaker 1>carry resentment and irritation about the child's misbehavior forward with you</v>

196
00:07:29.661 --> 00:07:33.080
<v Speaker 1>because you don't want a kid yourself about what sort of Nice person you are.</v>

197
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.270
<v Speaker 1>You're not nearly as nice a person as you think.</v>

198
00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:36.680
<v Speaker 1>And no one likes to be,</v>

199
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:37.783
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

200
00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:42.140
<v Speaker 1>brought down the authority hierarchy by a recalcitrant two year old.</v>

201
00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:45.290
<v Speaker 1>So in almost all circumstances,</v>

202
00:07:45.291 --> 00:07:47.720
<v Speaker 1>those processes will suffice.</v>

203
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:49.063
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

204
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:52.340
<v Speaker 1>there's other disciplinary strategies that you can use to that are more</v>

205
00:07:52.341 --> 00:07:53.001
<v Speaker 1>positive.</v>

206
00:07:53.001 --> 00:07:53.451
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

207
00:07:53.451 --> 00:07:54.860
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that you can do,</v>

208
00:07:54.861 --> 00:07:55.521
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

209
00:07:55.521 --> 00:07:56.354
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

210
00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:59.690
<v Speaker 1>let's say you want to get your child to go to bed,</v>

211
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:01.160
<v Speaker 1>which is a really good idea,</v>

212
00:08:01.161 --> 00:08:03.530
<v Speaker 1>you should set a stable bedtime for your child.</v>

213
00:08:03.531 --> 00:08:05.120
<v Speaker 1>And I would say if they're under four,</v>

214
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:08.810
<v Speaker 1>it should be around eight or seven or something like that.</v>

215
00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:11.870
<v Speaker 1>Because you want to have a life and you want to have a life with your wife so</v>

216
00:08:11.871 --> 00:08:14.480
<v Speaker 1>that you don't end up hating your child.</v>

217
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:18.590
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things you can do if you want to train your child to go to bed</v>

218
00:08:18.591 --> 00:08:18.951
<v Speaker 1>at eight,</v>

219
00:08:18.951 --> 00:08:23.630
<v Speaker 1>so maybe he's not going to bed until 10 right now and you want to fix that.</v>

220
00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:24.231
<v Speaker 1>So you say,</v>

221
00:08:24.231 --> 00:08:24.561
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

222
00:08:24.561 --> 00:08:28.700
<v Speaker 1>go to the grocery store or a little convenience store and buy 10 little gifts.</v>

223
00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:30.291
<v Speaker 1>And it can be cheap.</v>

224
00:08:30.291 --> 00:08:31.124
<v Speaker 1>Kids don't care.</v>

225
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:32.090
<v Speaker 1>They're not very bright.</v>

226
00:08:32.091 --> 00:08:32.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

227
00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:36.020
<v Speaker 1>you could fool them so by 10 little things that you think your kid would like</v>

228
00:08:36.021 --> 00:08:40.070
<v Speaker 1>and wrap them up and then put them up on a shelf where he can see them at,</v>

229
00:08:40.071 --> 00:08:40.904
<v Speaker 1>can't get at them.</v>

230
00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:42.323
<v Speaker 1>Then you say,</v>

231
00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:43.310
<v Speaker 1>look kid,</v>

232
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:46.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to put you to bed at nine 30 tonight and uh,</v>

233
00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:50.990
<v Speaker 1>if you don't get out of bed then I'm going to give you one of these.</v>

234
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give you one of these gifts in the morning.</v>

235
00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:54.793
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

236
00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:55.500
<v Speaker 1>or if the,</v>

237
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:56.880
<v Speaker 1>or you can do it another way too.</v>

238
00:08:56.881 --> 00:08:59.700
<v Speaker 1>If the child is always giving you a rough time about getting ready for bed and</v>

239
00:08:59.701 --> 00:09:00.211
<v Speaker 1>going to bed,</v>

240
00:09:00.211 --> 00:09:00.631
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>

241
00:09:00.631 --> 00:09:00.841
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

242
00:09:00.841 --> 00:09:01.530
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

243
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:05.460
<v Speaker 1>if you put on your pajamas without fussing and you climb into bed,</v>

244
00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:07.470
<v Speaker 1>they'll give you one of these little gifts.</v>

245
00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.300
<v Speaker 1>And so then if that works,</v>

246
00:09:09.301 --> 00:09:12.720
<v Speaker 1>then the child can have a little gift and he's in bed at nine 30 and then you</v>

247
00:09:12.721 --> 00:09:15.630
<v Speaker 1>can make it nine and then you can make it eight 30 and then you can make it</v>

248
00:09:15.631 --> 00:09:17.130
<v Speaker 1>eight and those are called,</v>

249
00:09:17.131 --> 00:09:18.900
<v Speaker 1>that's called success of approximation,</v>

250
00:09:18.901 --> 00:09:19.111
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

251
00:09:19.111 --> 00:09:19.944
<v Speaker 1>You hit the target,</v>

252
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:24.360
<v Speaker 1>you specify the target that you want the child to achieve and then use small</v>

253
00:09:24.361 --> 00:09:25.110
<v Speaker 1>rewards,</v>

254
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:28.230
<v Speaker 1>not too often in order to attain that goal.</v>

255
00:09:28.231 --> 00:09:31.770
<v Speaker 1>And those are unbelievably effective strategies and they can actually be pretty</v>

256
00:09:31.771 --> 00:09:32.400
<v Speaker 1>fun.</v>

257
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:36.750
<v Speaker 1>But I would say the advice to not let your child do anything that makes you</v>

258
00:09:36.751 --> 00:09:37.890
<v Speaker 1>dislike them is really,</v>

259
00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:39.780
<v Speaker 1>really useful.</v>

260
00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:40.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

261
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.780
<v Speaker 1>you want to talk this over with your partner too,</v>

262
00:09:42.781 --> 00:09:47.430
<v Speaker 1>so that you have your disciplinary strategies and your rules talked out so that</v>

263
00:09:47.431 --> 00:09:49.410
<v Speaker 1>you don't work at cross purposes to one another.</v>

264
00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:50.543
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

265
00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:51.330
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

266
00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.040
<v Speaker 1>so that's probably good enough for that.</v>
