1
00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.010
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing here,</v>

2
00:00:09.011 --> 00:00:10.360
<v Speaker 1>they're selling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.990
<v Speaker 1>ha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the great father of the family and</v>

4
00:00:13.991 --> 00:00:15.370
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these kids are,</v>

5
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.040
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of like the Soviet</v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent of cub scouts.</v>

6
00:00:18.041 --> 00:00:21.000
<v Speaker 1>They're sort of worship a game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I really liked the other one on</v>

7
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:21.970
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the right,</v>

8
00:00:21.971 --> 00:00:25.570
<v Speaker 1>because I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could hardly find a more hellish</v>

9
00:00:25.571 --> 00:00:27.910
<v Speaker 1>representation of a tyrant than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

10
00:00:27.911 --> 00:00:29.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks,</v>

11
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.310
<v Speaker 1>and this is quite interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like Stellan is standing in</v>

12
00:00:33.311 --> 00:00:36.520
<v Speaker 1>front of a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Door lock is Amanda Orla is a shape like</v>

13
00:00:36.521 --> 00:00:39.250
<v Speaker 1>this and all shape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see that in renaissance art all the</v>

14
00:00:39.251 --> 00:00:41.470
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an extremely old symbol.</v>

15
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.710
<v Speaker 1>It's the oldest symbol that people have</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever found evidence for.</v>

16
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.470
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like Stella,</v>

17
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.300
<v Speaker 1>there he is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>King of Hell.</v>

18
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.160
<v Speaker 1>And it's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

19
00:00:51.161 --> 00:00:51.710
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

20
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.900
<v Speaker 1>it's eerie that that's the mode of</v>
<v Speaker 1>representation that emerged for them,</v>

21
00:00:55.901 --> 00:00:57.580
<v Speaker 1>but it's certainly accurate.</v>

22
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:00.453
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.490
<v Speaker 1>the whole tyrannical end of the great</v>
<v Speaker 1>father is,</v>

24
00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.620
<v Speaker 1>this is the sort of thing that results</v>
<v Speaker 1>from it,</v>

25
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the,</v>

26
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.253
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.300
<v Speaker 1>elevation of the person at the top of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dominance hierarchy to the status of</v>

28
00:01:13.301 --> 00:01:16.660
<v Speaker 1>some kind of quasi identity certainly</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened in Hitler's case.</v>

29
00:01:16.661 --> 00:01:19.600
<v Speaker 1>And then the brutal murderousness that</v>
<v Speaker 1>can emerge from that,</v>

30
00:01:19.601 --> 00:01:23.890
<v Speaker 1>those are pictures from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>concentration camps at the end of World</v>

31
00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:24.460
<v Speaker 1>War Two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

32
00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I told you that the feminine can be</v>

33
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.570
<v Speaker 1>rep that terrible unknown things can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>represented by the feminine,</v>

34
00:01:31.571 --> 00:01:33.370
<v Speaker 1>sort of a monstrous figure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.640
<v Speaker 1>but it's certainly the case that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>monstrosity of culture is roughly</v>

36
00:01:39.041 --> 00:01:42.080
<v Speaker 1>equivalent to the monstrosity of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

37
00:01:42.081 --> 00:01:46.000
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things you might think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about is that common India tend to</v>

38
00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:49.240
<v Speaker 1>utilize these symbolic categories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost as if they appropriate them.</v>

39
00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.550
<v Speaker 1>So the environmental movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

40
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.310
<v Speaker 1>basically says benevolent nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

41
00:01:54.311 --> 00:01:57.970
<v Speaker 1>So that's the positive feminine negative</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture because that's cultures out</v>

42
00:01:57.971 --> 00:02:01.090
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rapaciously destroying the pristine</v>

43
00:02:01.091 --> 00:02:04.270
<v Speaker 1>wilderness of Mother Nature and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative individual too.</v>

44
00:02:04.271 --> 00:02:06.580
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings are part of that as</v>

45
00:02:06.581 --> 00:02:10.630
<v Speaker 1>individuals and we're kind of a cancer</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the face of the planet,</v>

46
00:02:10.631 --> 00:02:13.060
<v Speaker 1>if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's pretty dark way of looking</v>

47
00:02:13.061 --> 00:02:15.640
<v Speaker 1>at it obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's one sided because you could</v>

48
00:02:15.641 --> 00:02:16.780
<v Speaker 1>easily say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

49
00:02:16.781 --> 00:02:17.261
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

50
00:02:17.261 --> 00:02:20.020
<v Speaker 1>we're in a war with nature because</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously she's trying to kill us as</v>

51
00:02:20.021 --> 00:02:23.350
<v Speaker 1>fast as possible and we better have some</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture because otherwise we'd be</v>

52
00:02:23.351 --> 00:02:25.930
<v Speaker 1>sitting outside in the freezing snow and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:02:25.931 --> 00:02:29.920
<v Speaker 1>you might be a re patients consumer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on the other hand you're just trying</v>

54
00:02:29.921 --> 00:02:32.230
<v Speaker 1>to survive and it's not that easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

55
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to have both of those stories</v>

56
00:02:34.391 --> 00:02:38.050
<v Speaker 1>together before you have a reasonable</v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of the world.</v>

57
00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.450
<v Speaker 1>It's not easy to cope with something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

58
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.840
<v Speaker 1>well like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not easy to cope with something</v>

59
00:02:43.841 --> 00:02:48.841
<v Speaker 1>like that in every institution has this</v>
<v Speaker 1>potential and this element because</v>

60
00:02:49.451 --> 00:02:53.950
<v Speaker 1>institutions tend towards</v>
<v Speaker 1>bureaucratization and tyranny as they</v>

61
00:02:53.951 --> 00:02:55.960
<v Speaker 1>develop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They close up and become rigid.</v>

62
00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.861
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

63
00:02:56.861 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 1>that's a rough thing to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then of course is a rough thing to</v>

64
00:03:00.041 --> 00:03:01.510
<v Speaker 1>deal with too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might think,</v>

65
00:03:01.511 --> 00:03:03.970
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could have a little bit of sympathy</v>

66
00:03:03.971 --> 00:03:06.610
<v Speaker 1>for human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just throw them in the horrible</v>

67
00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:10.180
<v Speaker 1>rapacious creature category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is an extraordinarily</v>

68
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.510
<v Speaker 1>pathological and also a pre genocidal</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to do,</v>

69
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you hear environment to lists</v>

70
00:03:15.821 --> 00:03:18.820
<v Speaker 1>for example now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then say the planet would be better</v>

71
00:03:18.821 --> 00:03:20.590
<v Speaker 1>off without people on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

72
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:21.573
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

73
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.840
<v Speaker 1>that's Kinda what Hitler thought as well</v>
<v Speaker 1>about certain kinds of people anyways.</v>

74
00:03:25.841 --> 00:03:27.730
<v Speaker 1>And God only knows where he would have</v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped.</v>

75
00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:30.370
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when someone says something like that,</v>

76
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.550
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you might think is you</v>
<v Speaker 1>should take a good look at your</v>

77
00:03:33.551 --> 00:03:37.180
<v Speaker 1>unconscious structure there Bucko,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because fundamentally you're,</v>

78
00:03:37.181 --> 00:03:40.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a genocidal ideology at the</v>

79
00:03:40.901 --> 00:03:42.700
<v Speaker 1>bottom of your thoughts structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

80
00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:45.190
<v Speaker 1>you might think that you're an</v>
<v Speaker 1>environmentalist but you're actually</v>

81
00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:48.640
<v Speaker 1>possessed by a genocidal etiology and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you better do something about that.</v>

82
00:03:48.641 --> 00:03:52.180
<v Speaker 1>Because if you ever get any power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be one dangerous</v>

83
00:03:52.181 --> 00:03:52.720
<v Speaker 1>creature.</v>
