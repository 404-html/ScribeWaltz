00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.890
<v Speaker 1>You could ask one question</v>

2
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:08.093
<v Speaker 1>I'd like,</v>

3
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.290
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to ask them how the hell he figured out what it figured out because I</v>

4
00:00:13.291 --> 00:00:13.920
<v Speaker 1>can't,</v>

5
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.980
<v Speaker 1>I can understand how he can call</v>

6
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.460
<v Speaker 1>incalculably intelligent.</v>

7
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.301
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

8
00:00:21.301 --> 00:00:22.134
<v Speaker 1>when I read,</v>

9
00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.990
<v Speaker 1>I read everything he wrote the 1990s but 25 volumes of stuff.</v>

10
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.650
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like I understood all of it cause it's tough going.</v>

11
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.450
<v Speaker 1>I've just never been able to figure out how he can figure out what he did.</v>

12
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.950
<v Speaker 1>Maybe at an Iq of 180 you know,</v>

13
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.210
<v Speaker 1>people do one in a billion,</v>

14
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.930
<v Speaker 1>maybe he was wanting to billion so he could see things that I can't figure out</v>

16
00:00:49.981 --> 00:00:51.210
<v Speaker 1>how anyone can see.</v>

17
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:52.351
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

18
00:00:52.351 --> 00:00:54.960
<v Speaker 1>it might just be an incredible intelligence.</v>

19
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.510
<v Speaker 1>He sees to have a gift for imagination.</v>

20
00:00:57.511 --> 00:00:57.900
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

21
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:58.733
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.670
<v Speaker 1>some people are very good at articulation and we're good at thinking in words</v>

23
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.350
<v Speaker 1>and some people are good at thinking in pictures and he seemed to be really good</v>

24
00:01:07.351 --> 00:01:08.280
<v Speaker 1>at both.</v>

25
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.571
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

26
00:01:08.571 --> 00:01:12.900
<v Speaker 1>I had a tremendous amount of sedation and could dream 12 weight essentially.</v>

27
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.040
<v Speaker 1>And to learn how to do that and seem to learn all sorts of things from his</v>

28
00:01:17.041 --> 00:01:17.970
<v Speaker 1>weekend dreams.</v>

29
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.990
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

30
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.250
<v Speaker 1>and I can do that a little bit.</v>

31
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:21.061
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

32
00:01:21.061 --> 00:01:22.920
<v Speaker 1>sometimes when I'm doing therapy with people,</v>

33
00:01:22.921 --> 00:01:23.790
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

34
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.970
<v Speaker 1>I'll be listening to the macro picture will pop into my head there a little</v>

35
00:01:26.971 --> 00:01:28.110
<v Speaker 1>fragment of the story,</v>

36
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

37
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.970
<v Speaker 1>like a dream.</v>

38
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.760
<v Speaker 1>It comes with imagery and it sort of didn't background.</v>

39
00:01:32.761 --> 00:01:35.380
<v Speaker 1>And then I'll notice it and then I'll tell the person,</v>

40
00:01:35.381 --> 00:01:35.581
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>

41
00:01:35.581 --> 00:01:35.881
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

42
00:01:35.881 --> 00:01:38.550
<v Speaker 1>when you said that this happened in my imagination,</v>

43
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.160
<v Speaker 1>we can take apart the relationship between what they said and what happened in</v>

44
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.991
<v Speaker 1>my imagination.</v>

45
00:01:43.991 --> 00:01:46.830
<v Speaker 1>And that usually shipped substantial light on what's going on.</v>

46
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.050
<v Speaker 1>But he was an absolute master at that.</v>

47
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.190
<v Speaker 1>So I do actually find out from him how he managed that.</v>

48
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:55.980
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you couldn't say,</v>

49
00:01:55.981 --> 00:01:57.890
<v Speaker 1>but I actually like to know that.</v>

50
00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.753
<v Speaker 1>Anyone like that.</v>

51
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:01.620
<v Speaker 1>So there were a couple of questions.</v>
