1
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:07.361
<v Speaker 1>He said unto them,</v>

2
00:00:07.361 --> 00:00:08.560
<v Speaker 1>here I pray you this dream,</v>

3
00:00:08.561 --> 00:00:09.790
<v Speaker 1>which I have dreamed for.</v>

4
00:00:09.791 --> 00:00:10.241
<v Speaker 1>Behold,</v>

5
00:00:10.241 --> 00:00:11.080
<v Speaker 1>we were binding,</v>

6
00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.580
<v Speaker 1>we achieves in the field,</v>

7
00:00:12.581 --> 00:00:13.210
<v Speaker 1>and Lo,</v>

8
00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:14.650
<v Speaker 1>my sheaf arose.</v>

9
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.761
<v Speaker 1>And behold,</v>

10
00:00:15.761 --> 00:00:18.640
<v Speaker 1>your sheaves stood round about and bowed to my sheaf</v>

11
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:23.110
<v Speaker 1>and his,</v>

12
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:23.861
<v Speaker 1>and remember he's,</v>

13
00:00:23.861 --> 00:00:24.081
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

14
00:00:24.081 --> 00:00:24.731
<v Speaker 1>the young one,</v>

15
00:00:24.731 --> 00:00:25.200
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

16
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.600
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

17
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.820
<v Speaker 1>and also the daughter of the favorite wife,</v>

18
00:00:27.821 --> 00:00:28.890
<v Speaker 1>which is another thing that's,</v>

19
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.190
<v Speaker 1>or the son of the favorite wife,</v>

20
00:00:30.191 --> 00:00:30.851
<v Speaker 1>which is another thing,</v>

21
00:00:30.851 --> 00:00:32.380
<v Speaker 1>not really working in his favor.</v>

22
00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:33.790
<v Speaker 1>And his brethren said to him,</v>

23
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.950
<v Speaker 1>Shalt Thou indeed reign over us,</v>

24
00:00:35.951 --> 00:00:38.080
<v Speaker 1>or shall dow indeed have dominion over us?</v>

25
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.341
<v Speaker 1>And they hated him,</v>

26
00:00:39.341 --> 00:00:41.680
<v Speaker 1>yet the more for his dreams and for his words,</v>

27
00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.240
<v Speaker 1>while there there's a shock,</v>

28
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:44.021
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:00:44.021 --> 00:00:45.370
<v Speaker 1>that makes perfect sense.</v>

30
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.540
<v Speaker 1>So when it gets worse,</v>

31
00:00:46.541 --> 00:00:47.470
<v Speaker 1>so you see here,</v>

32
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.980
<v Speaker 1>well there's the wheat sheaves bowing there and uh,</v>

33
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.780
<v Speaker 1>and then you see this,</v>

34
00:00:52.781 --> 00:00:53.800
<v Speaker 1>what's going on here?</v>

35
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.011
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

36
00:00:54.011 --> 00:00:55.450
<v Speaker 1>that's not the end of his,</v>

37
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.280
<v Speaker 1>let's call it grandiosity.</v>

38
00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:58.503
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

39
00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.850
<v Speaker 1>and there's an idea too,</v>

40
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.060
<v Speaker 1>and in the Old Testament,</v>

41
00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:02.440
<v Speaker 1>especially in the stories of Joseph,</v>

42
00:01:02.441 --> 00:01:04.150
<v Speaker 1>that if God sends you a dream twice,</v>

43
00:01:04.151 --> 00:01:05.020
<v Speaker 1>he really means it.</v>

44
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:06.970
<v Speaker 1>And so I don't know if that's true,</v>

45
00:01:06.971 --> 00:01:09.280
<v Speaker 1>although I do know that people have repeating dreams.</v>

46
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:10.090
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

47
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.090
<v Speaker 1>it might be true that a dream you have twice is really trying to punch something</v>

48
00:01:15.101 --> 00:01:15.490
<v Speaker 1>home.</v>

49
00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.761
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

50
00:01:15.761 --> 00:01:20.170
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly the case that recurrent nightmares are meaningful and that</v>

51
00:01:20.171 --> 00:01:25.171
<v Speaker 1>recurrent nightmares are associated quite tightly with decreased states of</v>

52
00:01:25.271 --> 00:01:25.901
<v Speaker 1>mental health.</v>

53
00:01:25.901 --> 00:01:27.700
<v Speaker 1>And that if you can treat the nightmare,</v>

54
00:01:27.701 --> 00:01:28.990
<v Speaker 1>which is often quite easy,</v>

55
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.830
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

56
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:30.663
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

57
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.200
<v Speaker 1>then the,</v>

58
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.540
<v Speaker 1>some of the mental health problems will decrease.</v>

59
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.750
<v Speaker 1>So repeated dreams seem to be important anyways,</v>

60
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.660
<v Speaker 1>he dreamed yet another dream and told it to his brethren and said,</v>

61
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.321
<v Speaker 1>behold,</v>

62
00:01:41.321 --> 00:01:45.070
<v Speaker 1>I've had another dream and be and behold the sun and the moon.</v>

63
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.070
<v Speaker 1>And the 11 stars bowed to me and he told it to his father and to his brothers</v>

64
00:01:50.531 --> 00:01:52.540
<v Speaker 1>and his father rebuked him and said unto you,</v>

65
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.170
<v Speaker 1>unto him,</v>

66
00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.150
<v Speaker 1>what is this dream that thou history of shall I?</v>

67
00:01:55.151 --> 00:01:55.780
<v Speaker 1>And My,</v>

68
00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.160
<v Speaker 1>and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow down ourselves to the,</v>

69
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:01.563
<v Speaker 1>to the earth.</v>

70
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.670
<v Speaker 1>And his brothers envied him,</v>

71
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.250
<v Speaker 1>but his father observed to say,</v>

72
00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.631
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

73
00:02:07.631 --> 00:02:09.370
<v Speaker 1>what the hell do you make of something like that,</v>

74
00:02:09.371 --> 00:02:09.581
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

75
00:02:09.581 --> 00:02:12.400
<v Speaker 1>If someone tells you that it's like,</v>

76
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.930
<v Speaker 1>are they responsible for their dreams?</v>

77
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.990
<v Speaker 1>We don't really seem,</v>

78
00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.410
<v Speaker 1>we don't really hold ourselves responsible for are for the dreams we have at</v>

79
00:02:20.411 --> 00:02:24.460
<v Speaker 1>night and what do you make of a dream is like one of the things that you've</v>

80
00:02:24.461 --> 00:02:25.060
<v Speaker 1>pointed out,</v>

81
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.080
<v Speaker 1>this is where he differed from Freud substantially is Freud tended to think that</v>

82
00:02:29.081 --> 00:02:34.081
<v Speaker 1>the dream had its meaning because it's contents were acceptable to the conscious</v>

83
00:02:34.901 --> 00:02:36.460
<v Speaker 1>mind and young said,</v>

84
00:02:36.461 --> 00:02:36.641
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

85
00:02:36.641 --> 00:02:36.881
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

86
00:02:36.881 --> 00:02:37.900
<v Speaker 1>you don't understand.</v>

87
00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.920
<v Speaker 1>That's not what happens.</v>

88
00:02:38.921 --> 00:02:43.270
<v Speaker 1>What happens is the dream is doing the best it can to express something that the</v>

89
00:02:43.271 --> 00:02:47.140
<v Speaker 1>person doesn't yet really know and young thought about the dream as a</v>

90
00:02:47.141 --> 00:02:48.670
<v Speaker 1>manifestation of nature.</v>

91
00:02:48.671 --> 00:02:50.440
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't associated with the ego at all.</v>

92
00:02:50.441 --> 00:02:54.310
<v Speaker 1>It was just like you have a dream and there were things happening in it.</v>

93
00:02:54.311 --> 00:02:56.440
<v Speaker 1>The same way that when you walk into a dinner party,</v>

94
00:02:56.441 --> 00:02:58.000
<v Speaker 1>there are things happening there.</v>

95
00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.451
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

96
00:02:58.451 --> 00:02:59.284
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

97
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.760
<v Speaker 1>the dream isn't something that's subject to your capacity for manipulation.</v>

98
00:03:03.761 --> 00:03:05.080
<v Speaker 1>It's something that happens to you,</v>

99
00:03:05.081 --> 00:03:06.340
<v Speaker 1>not something that you do.</v>

100
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.530
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

101
00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.190
<v Speaker 1>so if someone has a dream like that,</v>

102
00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:10.810
<v Speaker 1>well you've got three options.</v>

103
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:13.660
<v Speaker 1>You can just discount dreams all together,</v>

104
00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:15.820
<v Speaker 1>which is what people in the modern world tend to do,</v>

105
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.500
<v Speaker 1>which is a very bad idea because their thoughts and you shouldn't discount them.</v>

106
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.393
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

107
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.520
<v Speaker 1>They're hardly random as some neuroscientists claim.</v>

108
00:03:24.521 --> 00:03:26.980
<v Speaker 1>That's absolutely cockeyed theory,</v>

109
00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:28.180
<v Speaker 1>that random.</v>

110
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.500
<v Speaker 1>He like television,</v>

111
00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:31.600
<v Speaker 1>Snow on a TV set if it was random.</v>

112
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.913
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

113
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.260
<v Speaker 1>so one is while you just discount dreams.</v>

114
00:03:35.261 --> 00:03:38.510
<v Speaker 1>The other is that you consider the person a liar and a braggart and a</v>

115
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:39.670
<v Speaker 1>narcissist.</v>

116
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.020
<v Speaker 1>And the third is,</v>

117
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:42.221
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

118
00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:43.060
<v Speaker 1>what's the third?</v>

119
00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.620
<v Speaker 1>It's like he dreamt that the sun and the moon and the stars bowed down to him.</v>

120
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.400
<v Speaker 1>You might think about that two or three times.</v>

121
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.271
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

122
00:03:52.271 --> 00:03:54.760
<v Speaker 1>but it's not necessarily something that's going to make you happy.</v>
