1
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:00.460
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2
00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:00.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

3
00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.610
<v Speaker 1>I often talk to people who are trying to make a difficult life decision and they</v>

4
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.230
<v Speaker 1>are weighing out the costs and the benefits of making the life decisions.</v>

5
00:00:09.231 --> 00:00:09.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.760
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things I always talk to them about is wait a second,</v>

7
00:00:12.761 --> 00:00:14.320
<v Speaker 1>that's an incomplete analysis.</v>

8
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.150
<v Speaker 1>You have to weigh out the benefits and the costs of doing this and you have to</v>

9
00:00:19.151 --> 00:00:21.460
<v Speaker 1>weigh out the costs and benefits of not doing that,</v>

10
00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:22.540
<v Speaker 1>not doing it.</v>

11
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.410
<v Speaker 1>And that's not the same as the zero that you assume that you're starting with.</v>

12
00:00:26.411 --> 00:00:26.980
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

13
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.910
<v Speaker 1>Because to not make a decision also has a cost.</v>

14
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.600
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes the cost of not making a decision is far worse than the cost of</v>

15
00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:35.434
<v Speaker 1>making a decision,</v>

16
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.480
<v Speaker 1>even if the decision is risky.</v>

17
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.490
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things you can derive from that,</v>

18
00:00:39.491 --> 00:00:41.290
<v Speaker 1>and this is very useful I think,</v>

19
00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:42.124
<v Speaker 1>is that</v>

20
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.780
<v Speaker 1>this is also I think why it's so useful to contemplate your mortality,</v>

21
00:00:46.781 --> 00:00:47.411
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

22
00:00:47.411 --> 00:00:48.640
<v Speaker 1>as you're screwed,</v>

23
00:00:48.641 --> 00:00:49.900
<v Speaker 1>no matter what you do,</v>

24
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

25
00:00:50.981 --> 00:00:53.200
<v Speaker 1>and that actually frees you is that you,</v>

26
00:00:53.201 --> 00:00:53.391
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

27
00:00:53.391 --> 00:00:55.660
<v Speaker 1>you have power at the hay that has catastrophes.</v>

28
00:00:55.661 --> 00:00:59.020
<v Speaker 1>And you have path B that has catastrophes and you don't get to have the no</v>

29
00:00:59.021 --> 00:01:00.160
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe path,</v>

30
00:01:00.161 --> 00:01:01.780
<v Speaker 1>but you get to pick which one.</v>

31
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.370
<v Speaker 1>And that's really something because if you know that there's terrible risk</v>

32
00:01:06.371 --> 00:01:08.800
<v Speaker 1>associated with everything that you do and don't do,</v>

33
00:01:08.801 --> 00:01:10.960
<v Speaker 1>then you can afford to take some risks because you're not,</v>

34
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.780
<v Speaker 1>and this is all within the arc metaphor.</v>

36
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm still making the case that despite the fact that your life is essentially</v>

37
00:01:18.521 --> 00:01:19.390
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic,</v>

38
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:20.470
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

39
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.070
<v Speaker 1>you can make a covenant with the highest ideal and that will take you through it</v>

40
00:01:24.071 --> 00:01:25.320
<v Speaker 1>the best way possible.</v>

41
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

42
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm still making that case.</v>

43
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:28.503
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

44
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:31.611
<v Speaker 1>so then you think,</v>

45
00:01:31.611 --> 00:01:31.911
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

46
00:01:31.911 --> 00:01:33.170
<v Speaker 1>well I'm trying to make this decision.</v>

47
00:01:33.171 --> 00:01:36.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go try to do something difficult and isn't that terrifying?</v>

48
00:01:36.141 --> 00:01:36.681
<v Speaker 1>And then you think,</v>

49
00:01:36.681 --> 00:01:36.891
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

50
00:01:36.891 --> 00:01:37.724
<v Speaker 1>but wait a minute.</v>

51
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.460
<v Speaker 1>What's really terrifying is not doing it.</v>

52
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.300
<v Speaker 1>And then you think about the cost of not doing it.</v>

53
00:01:44.301 --> 00:01:45.650
<v Speaker 1>So in the future authoring program,</v>

54
00:01:45.651 --> 00:01:46.940
<v Speaker 1>we have people do this,</v>

55
00:01:46.941 --> 00:01:48.200
<v Speaker 1>a little meditative exercise,</v>

56
00:01:48.201 --> 00:01:48.471
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

57
00:01:48.471 --> 00:01:48.771
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

58
00:01:48.771 --> 00:01:52.670
<v Speaker 1>just think about your insufficiencies by your own definition,</v>

59
00:01:52.671 --> 00:01:52.941
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

60
00:01:52.941 --> 00:01:57.941
<v Speaker 1>The way that you don't do what you know you should do about the things that you</v>

61
00:01:57.951 --> 00:01:58.940
<v Speaker 1>do that you shouldn't do,</v>

62
00:01:58.941 --> 00:02:01.820
<v Speaker 1>that you know you shouldn't do beyond a shadow of a doubt,</v>

63
00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:02.061
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

64
00:02:02.061 --> 00:02:06.710
<v Speaker 1>There's some things like that and that that's bad habits and poor aim and all of</v>

65
00:02:06.711 --> 00:02:10.940
<v Speaker 1>the resentment and hatred and aggression and unresolved conflicts and all those</v>

66
00:02:10.941 --> 00:02:14.060
<v Speaker 1>things that are dementing you and warping you and then think,</v>

67
00:02:14.061 --> 00:02:14.630
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

68
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.190
<v Speaker 1>those things get the upper hand man,</v>

69
00:02:16.191 --> 00:02:19.880
<v Speaker 1>they get the upper hand and they take you the worst possible place you could go</v>

70
00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.200
<v Speaker 1>in the next three to five years.</v>

71
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.210
<v Speaker 1>What exactly does that look like?</v>

72
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.580
<v Speaker 1>And so you sketch all that out and you think,</v>

73
00:02:25.581 --> 00:02:25.761
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

74
00:02:25.761 --> 00:02:26.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to go there.</v>

75
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.630
<v Speaker 1>And so the next time that a temptation comes up,</v>

76
00:02:29.631 --> 00:02:29.961
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

77
00:02:29.961 --> 00:02:30.111
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

78
00:02:30.111 --> 00:02:32.720
<v Speaker 1>it'd be a lot better for me if I didn't succumb to this temptation.</v>

79
00:02:32.721 --> 00:02:32.991
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

80
00:02:32.991 --> 00:02:33.824
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of weak.</v>

81
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.550
<v Speaker 1>You'd look a little better if you didn't eat like a cheesecake a day or</v>

82
00:02:37.551 --> 00:02:38.384
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

83
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:39.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

84
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.650
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

85
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:40.281
<v Speaker 1>that's something,</v>

86
00:02:40.281 --> 00:02:41.690
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the same as,</v>

87
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

88
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have diabetes and I'm going to lose my damn leg and in,</v>

89
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.650
<v Speaker 1>in five years if I don't get my eating under control.</v>

90
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.000
<v Speaker 1>That's motivating.</v>

91
00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:51.920
<v Speaker 1>And so then the temptation comes along and you think,</v>

92
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.233
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

93
00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.070
<v Speaker 1>how about no,</v>

94
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.023
<v Speaker 1>seriously?</v>

95
00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.691
<v Speaker 1>How about,</v>

96
00:02:56.691 --> 00:02:56.931
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

97
00:02:56.931 --> 00:03:01.490
<v Speaker 1>not just because a higher good would be obtained if I avoided it,</v>

98
00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.840
<v Speaker 1>but because of a terrible catastrophe would be averted if I didn't.</v>
