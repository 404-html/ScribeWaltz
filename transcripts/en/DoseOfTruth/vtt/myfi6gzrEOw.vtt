00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.410
<v Speaker 1>My chapter on theisms versions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heaven,</v>

2
00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:13.500
<v Speaker 1>I sloped the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably won't be accepted by</v>

3
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.400
<v Speaker 1>evangelicals and fundamentalists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

4
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.530
<v Speaker 1>when Jesus talked about the kingdom is</v>
<v Speaker 1>within a images,</v>

5
00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.690
<v Speaker 1>there's not as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not as often as I would've liked,</v>

6
00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:29.130
<v Speaker 1>but I think he's referring to the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that habit is within us in the sense</v>

7
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.290
<v Speaker 1>that we should be aiming to improve</v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>

8
00:00:31.291 --> 00:00:33.990
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Christians and atheists of</v>

9
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.540
<v Speaker 1>conflicted over this passage where he</v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

10
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:37.951 --> 00:00:39.740
<v Speaker 1>Matthew Sixteen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty six,</v>

12
00:00:39.741 --> 00:00:41.910
<v Speaker 1>I say unto you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are some standing here which will</v>

13
00:00:41.911 --> 00:00:44.790
<v Speaker 1>not taste death until they see the son</v>
<v Speaker 1>of man coming in his kingdom.</v>

14
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.670
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:46.590
<v Speaker 1>of course atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

16
00:00:46.591 --> 00:00:47.270
<v Speaker 1>ha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ha,</v>

17
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.540
<v Speaker 1>ha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's still not here.</v>

18
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.810
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

19
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.280
<v Speaker 1>but what if he meant something else that</v>
<v Speaker 1>heaven is not a place to go,</v>

20
00:00:53.281 --> 00:00:54.150
<v Speaker 1>but a way to be</v>

21
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.050
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now I'm very,</v>

22
00:00:56.051 --> 00:00:59.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you call a viewpoint that I</v>

23
00:00:59.651 --> 00:01:02.110
<v Speaker 2>think is very much worth pursuing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would also.</v>

24
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.530
<v Speaker 2>But I also think there's something</v>
<v Speaker 2>deeply strange about that too because,</v>

25
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.750
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that if a psychological state</v>

26
00:01:10.751 --> 00:01:13.510
<v Speaker 2>becomes profound enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it starts to become a social state.</v>

27
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.110
<v Speaker 2>And so I would say that that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Kingdom of God that's within,</v>

28
00:01:17.111 --> 00:01:18.850
<v Speaker 2>which is something tolstoy wrote a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

29
00:01:18.851 --> 00:01:21.580
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a book that he wrote,</v>

30
00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:24.910
<v Speaker 2>a book called the Kingdom of God is</v>
<v Speaker 2>within us and that profoundly influenced</v>

31
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.610
<v Speaker 2>Mahatma Gandhi by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they had lengthy correspondence</v>

32
00:01:27.611 --> 00:01:29.990
<v Speaker 2>which was part of the reason that Gandhi</v>
<v Speaker 2>became a non</v>

33
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.050
<v Speaker 2>use nonviolent resistance right in his</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight against the English,</v>

34
00:01:35.051 --> 00:01:37.810
<v Speaker 2>which was quite interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think that there is,</v>

35
00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.410
<v Speaker 2>there is there look something like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe when you go to a concert,</v>

36
00:01:46.571 --> 00:01:50.160
<v Speaker 2>it's a great concert and you're having a</v>
<v Speaker 2>very profound psychological experience</v>

37
00:01:50.161 --> 00:01:51.760
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of unity and harmony,</v>

38
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.830
<v Speaker 2>which of course is what you get into</v>
<v Speaker 2>concert.</v>

39
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.610
<v Speaker 2>But if the experience is profound enough</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologically and individually,</v>

40
00:01:57.611 --> 00:02:01.060
<v Speaker 2>it also starts to encompass and envelop</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people around you.</v>

41
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.140
<v Speaker 2>And so I think the Kingdom of God that</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christ was talking about with something</v>

42
00:02:05.141 --> 00:02:07.090
<v Speaker 2>like this is why I like jumped piaget so</v>
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>

43
00:02:07.091 --> 00:02:11.020
<v Speaker 2>It's something like the and equilibrated</v>
<v Speaker 2>state where things are working out</v>

44
00:02:11.021 --> 00:02:14.530
<v Speaker 2>really well for you when you're deeply</v>
<v Speaker 2>immersed in a meaningful experience,</v>

45
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.190
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time that meaning is</v>
<v Speaker 2>structured so that it's maximally</v>

46
00:02:18.191 --> 00:02:21.400
<v Speaker 2>beneficial for the people who are</v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately around you and for the</v>

47
00:02:21.401 --> 00:02:26.200
<v Speaker 2>people who are distantly related to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so everything stacks up and some</v>

48
00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.780
<v Speaker 2>that's some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's something like the idea of the</v>

49
00:02:28.781 --> 00:02:30.550
<v Speaker 2>ladder to have under the stairway to</v>
<v Speaker 2>heaven,</v>

50
00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.640
<v Speaker 2>did everything stacking up properly and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then there's an.</v>

51
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.930
<v Speaker 2>There is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

52
00:02:34.931 --> 00:02:38.140
<v Speaker 2>I think when people experience that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is where the metaphysics</v>

53
00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.600
<v Speaker 2>touches the material.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that when people.</v>

54
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.150
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly that precisely got yes.</v>

55
00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:44.043
<v Speaker 2>Precisely that.</v>

56
00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.110
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you notice that the demons are</v>

57
00:02:47.111 --> 00:02:49.890
<v Speaker 2>upside down going down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

58
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.570
<v Speaker 2>Which is exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly the right way to</v>

59
00:02:52.571 --> 00:02:55.510
<v Speaker 2>conceptualize it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that when people have an</v>

60
00:02:55.511 --> 00:03:00.511
<v Speaker 2>experience of that stacking of meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they also have an intimation of</v>

61
00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:05.740
<v Speaker 2>immortality that goes along with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's embodied and that that's partly</v>

62
00:03:05.741 --> 00:03:09.520
<v Speaker 2>why they're metaphysical speculations</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the reality of the Kingdom of</v>

63
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.050
<v Speaker 2>Heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There'll be merged because it's not just</v>

64
00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:15.850
<v Speaker 2>conceptual right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is embodied experience and people</v>

65
00:03:15.851 --> 00:03:19.120
<v Speaker 2>report the same thing when they have</v>
<v Speaker 2>transcendental experiences of various</v>

66
00:03:19.121 --> 00:03:21.850
<v Speaker 2>sorts and those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we know from a scientific</v>

67
00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:25.420
<v Speaker 2>perspective that those can be very</v>
<v Speaker 2>reliably induced with the use of agents</v>

68
00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:26.350
<v Speaker 2>like psilocybin.</v>
